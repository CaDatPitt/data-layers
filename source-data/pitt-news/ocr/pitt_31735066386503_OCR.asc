Bazaar, held yesterday in the
Forbes Quadrangle Galleria as
part of Black Week.

On a chocolate pizza, toppings
such as cheese, pepperoni and
anchovies are substituted with
coconut, dates and raisins.

Juliah, a Pittsburgh merchant,
said that chocolate pizza is her
own original concept and is one

that confuses customers at first. 4

“Everyone who walks by is
like, ‘chocolate pizza?’ But
eventually they catch on,” she
said. She started with three dozen
chocolate pizzas at 10 a.m., when
the Black Bazaar opened, and

chocolate-covered pretzels and

“I like the students,”,she said.
“It’s the first time I've ever gotten

Washington, Pa., sells sweatshirts
and buttons bearing slogans, such
as “Strong men keep on coming,”

“It’s not the kind [of papyrus]

Shaahid operates a bookstore

“I sell a number of different

Ohio. Jones sold hats, T-shirts,
incense and jewelry at the bazaar.

Jamal Muhammad, who sells
hand-made T-shirts, said the

Continued from page I
Do [they] really want to enter a
job market where the workers
have no power or the ability to
organize and make a better life
for themselves?’ she asked.

Chuck Osborn, an executive
board officer for Local 1043 of
the Amalgamated Transit Union,
realizes that some people have
forgotten about their strike.

“When striking goes on for a
long time, people go on with
their lives,” he said.

Feeney believes that the march
was successful at helping this
situation. '

“It was dark, and the torches
were really noticeable. We were
getting a lot of attention. Cars
were honking, and we were
chanting the sayings [we had
worked out before the marchl,”
said Feeney.

One of these slogans was “Drop
Dead Fred,” referring to Fred
Currey, the chief executive officer
and president of Greyhound.

The strike began last year in
March when the employees’ old
contract expired.

“We have taken concessions
since 1978. The last two contracts
had major money concessions,
but we were willing to go back to
work with the contract of that
time,” Osborn said.

He continued to explain that
the new contract included
employee cutbacks and the
closing of maintenance centers.

“They stopped bargaining in
good faith and went on to start
hiring people. We were still
working, and they were hiring
replacements,” Osborn said.

For this reason, Greyhound has
been charged by the Federal
Labor Relations Board for unfair
labor practices. The court date is
set for Nov. 29.

On Nov. 19, Greyhound will
also have a bankruptcy hearing.

The union will propose an offer.

at the hearing to buy the company
through the Employee Stock
Option Plan and in correlation
with Black Stone Investments, a
New York investing ﬁrm.

“Of course, he’ll say that it isn't
for sale,” Osborn said.

Osborn also said that there is

he can convince them his
reorganization plan is feasible.
The business is off so much now;
I don’t know how [it] could reach
[its] debts," Osborn said.

Another matter that will be
brought up by the labor board is
the number of accidents that have
occurred since the strike.

According to Guy Kalhoun, a
representative of ATU, there has
been 3,200 accidents since March.
He also said that only 20 percent
of the replacement Greyhound
drivers had previously been bus
drivers.

The strike has caused other
problems for the public.

“The strike isn't just hurting us.
A lot of the runs were cut, which
is hurting people in some rural
areas,” said union member Bob
Kuhar.

According to Kalhoun, 75
percent of the runs have been
cut.

Kalhoun believes that their

lbusting is

strike is just one example of the
problems that all unions face.-

“This signifies what big
businesses are doing against
labor. This same type of union-
happening
everywhere,” he said.

Kalhoun also mentioned 35
incidents of strikers being hit by
buses while. they were picketing,
including two that have been
killed. He also said that there
have been many incidents of
police brutality.

“These are the tactics that they
use. It's called intimidation,"
Kalhoun said.

While the union supporters
chanted inside, outside a few
members of socialist groups were
trying to get their ideas across.

Shea McKinney, a member of
Pitt’s Young Socialists
organization, said that the leaders
within the union are betraying
their own union members.

“The working class has to
rebuild the leadership of their
unions. The working class does
not just mean unions, but people
who are doing the work,” he said

Activist urges black students to be more politically organized

By Milt Klopfer
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

A political organizer and activist
called for students to organize
and educate themselves politically
when he spoke last night in the
William Pitt Union Assembly
Room.

“Students occupy a special role
[with] their ability and skill to
bring ideology to the people,”
said Mike Cooper of the All-
African People’s Revolutionary
Party, a worldwide organization
of human- and political-rights
activists. Cooper came to Pitt as
part of Black Week.

“If we look at [blacks] as a

people, the greatest problem we
face is political ignorance and
disorganization," he said.

Cooper urged the development
of a unified political ideology
based on the principles of
scientiﬁc socialism, for all black
people.

“Because we are an oppressed
people [and] because we are
disorganized, we must all [join]
some permanent organization
waging political struggle,” he said.

The principle of scientiﬁc

socialism, according to Cooper,
is all people controlling the means
of economic production in an
egalitarian and non.-
discriminatory unified world

society. It is an alternative to the
capitalistic ideology which
Cooper said oppresses ethnic
minorities worldwide.

“The road to socialism is a
revolutionary road,” he said. “A
socialist state cannot come about
spontaneously. [Regimes] can
seize power spontaneously, but
a socialist state cannot.”

The role of students in this
struggle, said Cooper, is to use
their university experiences to
gain knowledge of past
revolutions and the potentials of
post-revolutionary socialistic
societies.

“The student has access to
treasure that our people need:

revolutionary information,” he
said.
Khieka Jenning, a sophomore

' from the Community College of

Allegheny County, asked Cooper
how student organization is
supposed to take place amid
apathy.

“What we have [among black
students] is complacency," she
said. “People are satisfied with

~ absolutely nothing. As a student

leader, what can I do do to
encourage involvement?"

Cooper said that the solution to
apathy is to remind black students
of the historical struggle for
knowledge that their forebears
have gone through.

“Our people have staged
relentless struggle and spilled

blood to open the doors of’

knowledge,” he said. "Our people
are owed a responsibility.”

Pitt sophomore Malik Herron
agreed that student organization
is a valuable agent in ridding the
world of oppression. “It has to
start somewhere,” he said.

“The first thing [black students]
need to address is the apathy
level and the complacency," said
junior Rodd Willis. “Not being
politically aware is like putting
the cart before the the horse."

Nov. 6 — A Tower A resident
told campus police that she has
received four harassing phone
calls in the past three days from
a male caller with a deep, raspy
voice and who claims that he is a
local professional sports
personality. The man gives her a
phone number, which is out of
service, to call him. The student
says that the caller starts out with
normal conversation then
describes ‘sexual acts to her.
Whenever the student tries to
dissuade his calls, he becomes
very angry. She is very upset with
the calls because the caller knows
numerous personal things about
her. She also told the officer that
she arranged to meet this man.
The officer advised her to contact
a detective and not to meet with
him unless an officer is with her.

Nov. 6 —— Two Tower B
residents stated that they left their
room and locked their door, but
when one of the two residents
returned, she found the door
open. Later, both roommates
discovered that their MAC cards’
were missing, although no cash
or other cards were missing. They
contacted the Office of Residence
Life to have their lock changed
and contacted their banks to have
their account numbers Changed.

Apatbypozrtlyfault of SGB. ..

In case the students of this university did not realize it,
Student Government Board elections were held yesterday.
It was obvious that few students were aware of these
elections, for voter turnout was less than 15 percent.

According to Theresa Wilson, elections-committee
chairperson, only 1,890 undergraduates turned out to
vote for the most important election they can take part in
on this campus. I

However, this may not be solely the fault of the students.
In recent months, the student government has been
criticized for not involving the Pitt students more with
decision-making. I "

Now there is a new governing body representing the

gain the respect of the student body. It will be its job to
make the students of this campus realize that they will be
equally represented and heard before decisions are made.

The students had their chance to make a difference.
They took this important decision as seriously as they did
the homecoming elections. Now the SGB has the
responsibility of proving that the students were mistaken
in their apathy. Students should not complain about
actions of the board or equal representation. They had
their chance; now let’s give the SGB theirs.

Let drivers buy Greyhound.

When a company files for bankruptcy, many owners
have the option to cut their losses and run. This holds very
true for the Greyhound management, which has the
opportunity to let others run the company.

Last March, Greyhound bus drivers went on strike,
because the owners wanted to cut jobs. In an effort to
survive, Greyhound hired replacement drivers to keep
the business running.

This move angered many workers, and violence erupted
along picket lines. Shots and even arrows were ﬁred at
buses. Bombs exploded amid crowded bus stations. One
striking driver was killed as he was pinned against a wall
by a bus.

Since then, the drivers have suffered many hardships
from lack of income. Concerned citizens held a rally in
downtown Pittsburgh yesterday to raise money for the
striking drivers, who will not get a fair hearing until Nov.
29, when Greyhound goes before the Federal Labor
Relations Board.

On Nov. 19, however, Greyhound will have its
bankruptcy hearing. At that time, it will hear an offer from
the drivers to buy out the company.

Greyhound management will have its chance to cut its
losses and let others do what they can with a struggling
company. If management doesn’t do this, then both it and

The rest of the world, it seems,
has ﬁnally gone over the edge of
reality. After too many long years
of being enamored with the
leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev,
the international peace
community has reached the low
point of insanity by slapping the
downtrodden of the world in the
face with the insult of a Nobel
Peace Prize with Gorbachev’s
name on it.

What’s that you say? There must
be some misunderstanding. Not
our beloved Gorby! Let’s look at
how “peaceful” Mr. Gorbachev
has been in only the last year.

He began the year with a bang
—— several of them, actually —— in
the Soviet republics of Georgia,
Armenia and Azerbaijan by
choosing to crush the resistance
to Communist power. After
quickly conﬁscating all ﬁrearms
and means of defense from these
people, Mr. Gorbachev sent in
the Red army with orders to use
any means possible to crush any
dissent. In Azerbaijan, this meant
gassing (much like his friend in
Iraq), and in Georgia and Armenia
this meant daily executions of
unarmed dissidents. Furthermore,
he has shown no regard to those
Armenians still dying because of
the Chernobyl accident in 1986.
What happened to all those voices

THEE? secoubs AFTER
WORUD WAR IIL tsewxl
J59? WAS GOING H0""F-an

Wl'lE?E l 5 THAT
5°C DAMN MNET7,

the

speaking out against
T iananmen Square massacre? The
Russian people couldn’t speak
out because of the law pushed
through the Soviet government
that made it illegal to denounce
the government. It seems that
glasnost only applies to
Gorbachev.

By March, he had really begun
to showhis “peaceful” tendencies
by his reaction to the dissent
from the Baltic states. Have we

Tom
Lester

forgotten that Lithuania was
subjected to a military crackdown
in which all newspapers,
television and radio stations and
public buildings in Vilnius were
occupied by the Red army? When
this failed to curb the dissent,
Gorby cut off all needed supplies,
including vital fuels and food,
with an offhand warning to
Estonia and Latvia of what would
happen to them if they failed to
remain obedient.

Even if you dismiss these cases
as purely domestic issues in which
the world has no say, you have to
consider some of Gorby’s

international “peace” overtures.
For example, despite a terribly
weakened economy, he has

continued to support some of the _

most violent groups and causes
on the international scene. He
still supports Cuba, which in turn
pours money into the FMLN and
Sandinistas, thereby exporting
Communist terrorism throughout
Latin America. In Southeast Asia
he still pumps billions into the
Vietnamese, Cambodian and
North Korean dictatorships that

tirelessly undermine the actionst.

of their democratic competitors
like Thailand, South Korea and
the Philippines. s

Finally, let’s keep in mind that
such violent terrorist groups as
the African National Conference,
the Irish Republican Army, the
SenderoLuminoso (Peru) and the
Palestine Liberation Organization
all are directly funded, supported

and trained by Gorby’s “new¢

KGB" of the era of glasnost.

Let’s not soil the list of former
winners of the Nobel Peace Prize
by adding I a hypocritical and
power-hungry dictator to it.
Someone like Vaclav Havel, who
freed his people from Communist
oppression, should have received
the acclaimed prize.

T 0 bell with Satanism and sozcrifzce

This is in reference to Uessical Coville’s article on
Oct. 31. Before you put other groups down, you
should listen to what you’re saying. You have failed
to realize two things in reference to Levey’s Satanic
Bible. The first is when you read

his book, it seems you read the
first chapter but forgot the 11th,
which says, “Sacriﬁces enhance
rituals.” The second is, when you

refer to Satanism stemming from this book, you are
ignoring all preceding Satanism. And that is
contradictory to your other statement of Satanism
as ‘offshoot of Christianity.” Satanism existed long
before Levey wrote his book, and it is only his
interpretation. Satanists do kill people as sacriﬁces;

Letters

not all ‘do, but that doesn’t mean that others don't ,
And since you asked, I'll tell you why my

“barbecued ‘chicken’ is more noble than these

“sacriﬁces.” Yes, Christians do worship a sacriﬁced
man — but not sacriﬁced in either your terms or
anything close to [Satanist’s.] In Satanism, they
sacrifice to worship Satan. In Christianity, Jesus

Christ himself was sacriﬁced for

us. And what you call a “putrveﬁedﬁ

image” is a mistake on your part.
The cruciﬁx shows that God
willingly endured such pain and

suffering. No, it doesn’t mean Christians worship
suffering; it shows that God did more than just die
for us; He was also willing to go through agony and
persecution. And as Satanism is an “offshoot” of
Christianity and Satan himself is the father of lies,
what makes you think he’s telling the truth now?»u.

By Tim Azinger
Managing Editor

For the Screaming Trees, life with a
major label hasn’t proved as fruitful as it
should. They don’t have a monstrous tour
bus, and they still aren’t headlining shows.

"' 'I'hey’re still bouncing around the country

in a half-rate van.

Vocalist Mark Lanegan doesn’t seem to
be concerned with much of anything
(unless, of course, it deals with music),
least of all that the band’s van isn’t running.

“These things are to be expected,” he
grumbles over the phone. Just another
day in the life of rock’n’roll.

Lanegan’s nonchalant attitude carries

' over through most of the conversation
until I make several references to the
band’s biographical sheet. “I’m going to
have to read this bio,” Lanegan laughs. “It
sounds really fucking stupid!”

Hailing from Ellensburg, Wash., (they’ve
since relocated to Seattle), the Trees have

,,been slowly but noisily making their way
through the ranks of the underground.
‘Starting back in the spring of 1985, Mark
met up with the Conner brothers, Gary
Lee (guitar) and Van (bass), and Mark

Pickerel (drums) to Aformthe core of what‘

is now the Screaming Trees. (At the time
of this interview Pickerel had left the
band.)

While the band members were still in
high school, the band gave a copy of its
demo to Greg Ginn at a Black Flag show
in Seattle. SST signed them shortly after
and in 1988 released the Other W/0rldsEP.

Since then, things have come relatively
easy for the band. Four full-length albums
and three EPs have followed, including its
latest release on Epic, the S0methingAb0ut
Today EP.

Early influences ranged from the Beatles
to Black Sabbath, but punk was the big
thing. The Screaming Trees took it all in
and regurgitated a very personalized style.

The Screaming Trees have mastered a
grungy, neo—psychedelic sound. I say
“neo—psychedelic” only because the band
feels the word “psychedelic” conveys trying
to be something from the past, which they
believe they’re not.

The Trees were relatively unheard of
until they surfaced amidst all the buzz of
the West Coast, Sub Pop—label frenzy.
Located in Seattle, it was only a matter of
time before Sub Pop recruited the Trees
into its ranks of ultra——talented performers.
Sub Pop had bred other masterfully

successful acts (Soundgarden, Mudhoney,

Nirvana), so it was no surprise to ﬁnd the
Trees among them.

Something About Today is just a teaser
of what’s contained on the Trees’ Epic

‘debut album, tentatively titled Uncle

Anaesthesia, due out the first week in

‘January 1991.

Signing to a major label was more of an

"experimental endeavor than an attempt at

receiving loads of money and fame.

“Overthe years we’ve had several records
on various independent labels: SST and
Sub Pop, ” says Lanegan. “Eventually major
labels contacted us, and we figured, ‘why
not?’ It was something we hadn’t done
before, so... what the hell? Epic was the
choice because we knew they really
wouldn’t fuck with us in any way.”

So many bands have succumbed to the
manipulative powersof the major labels,
but the Trees seem confident enough in
their artistic abilities that devoted fans
shouldn’t worry. Something About Today
is a polished tribute to garage noise.

“Naturally there are lots of differences
between dealing with the smaller,
independent labels and the huge

" corporations,” says Lanegan. “Business-

wise there are lots of changes; music-wise

there aren't. We’re not capable of radically
changing just like like that to be the kind
of band someone thinks we should be.”

Usually when someone leaves a band,
it’s for good, and a permanent replacement
is found. For members of the Screaming
Trees (each has left the band and returned
at least once), quitting is an almost
therapeutic practice. .

“Well, yeah, that’s natural,” says Lanegan.
“We’re all just different people. The way
this band works is probably not that
different than the way other bands work.
We’re like a family; imagine if you could
never move out. Everybody needs time to
themselves. It’s not easy doing this,
especially when you don't have a
somewhat ‘normal’ life at home. It just
happens.”

Each member has been involved in his _

own musical endeavors. Lanegan just
released The Winding Sheet on Sub Pop.
Gary Conner has an album out with The
Purple Outside, and Van worked with the
group Solomon Grundy.

These solo projects couldn't avoid being
tagged as the end of the Screaming Trees,
but once again the Trees beat the rock
stereotype.

'Jacob's 

is a scary

By Matthew Myers
Sta 1;“ W1-iter

With blockbuster hits like
Flasbdance and Fatal A ttraction,
director Adrian Lyne doesn't need
to worry about money. Like Tim
Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman),
David Lynch C Wild atHean‘, Twin
Peaks) and Sam Raimi (E1/z'lDead,
Dar/eman), Lyne‘ has firmly
established himself in that coveted
position in Hollywood where
young, successful directors are
given anything they want to
complete a feature film.

Since money is no longer a
problem, Mr. Lyne should start
worrying more about living up to
the politique des auteurs in the
advertisements of his new film
Jacobs Ladder, which opened
nationwide last week.

While it is being promoted as a
mainstream horror film, fans of
the genre and of Fatal Attraction
are sure to be disappointed
because this film contains no
conventional elements of

American cinematic storytelling,
and its narrative is ﬁlled with so
many bizarre surreal images that
no average moviegoer is going
to know what the hell is going
on. And if it’s one thing U.S.
audiences need, it’s a firm grasp
on the generic elements of the
commercial cinema.

Written by Ghost screenwriter
BruceJoel Rubin (another popular
tag for the film’s hype), Jacobs
Ladderhas long been an anomaly
in the film industry. It was voted
by many producers as one of the
10 best unproduced scripts
ﬂoating around Hollywood.

But of course, no studio wanted
to touch it, probably because it
seemed like a financial
impossibility (due to the
expensive visual effects the
screenplay called for), but also
because no director could
visualize a picture that had more
than one or two reality levels
beyond Police Academy.

Only when Adrian Lyne, hot
from his Oscar—nominated tour
with Fatal Attraction, decided to
use his new star status to develop
the project, did Tri—Star and the

The result is a roller—coaster

It’s an odd match, Jacob and
Jezzie, and we’re not sure if she’s
really good for him or not. By the
end of this film, Jacob is so

paranoid about the unsettling '‘

world around him that he can’t
help but suspect her of being a
harmful companion. But then,

she contradicts that notion too,

forJe zzie is not only the sensuous
lover but also the watchful
mother-ﬁgure of Jacob.

There is no indication as to
what is real and what is illusory in
this movie, but Adrian Lyne
compels us to keep going on this
wild ride through Jacob’s mind.
Some might say there is no story,

 rrrr news,  INoMv_e~1nI>er 8, 1§§o

By Rico Gagliano
For The Pitt News

If you’re like me, and my

‘lcondolences if you are, you

mainly keep the dial tuned to
Channel 71 on extended “A”
cable, i.e., MTV. And if you’re
like me, you sit there and stare at
the tube far more often than you
ought to —— watching hour after
hour of what probably amounts
to cultural brainwashing, bitching
constantly about the sad state of
affairs that has produced this
channel of pure consumer
commercialism, but watching
nonetheless.

Probably you’re not like me,

I though, and have far better things

to waste your time on. To you,
then, I dedicate this column, in
which I attempt to condense the
MTV experience into several
inches of newsprint by focusing
on a few videos I feel like talking

about.

Note that I’m usually in classes
during the day and work at night,
so these videos were picked from
MTV’s late—night rotation, which
is somewhat looser and cooler
than its strictly Top 40 daytime
rotation. If you’ve never seen
some of these videos, that’s why.

1. Information Society -—
“Think.” Thought I’d start off
with a cool video. The song itself
is a sad attempt to revive the
dance—pop New Wave of the
early ’80s —— all synthesized
orchestral WHUMPS and British
accents. Fortunately, the video
revives the videos of that same
early ’80s era, and that’s cool.
Lots of bright blues and reds, big

computer-printout symbols and ~

band members wearing clunky
helmets with wires sticking out.
The end features a post—nuclear
armored sports car right out of
Tom Petty’s classic “You Got

2. Social Distortion——“Story
of My Life.” Two years ago
Social Distortion was a hardcore
band with an album so full of
obscenities you couldn’t play half
the songs on the radio. Then they
signed to Epic records, and now
they sound like the Del Lords
with eyeliner. The video is in
gritty black and white. Oh, wow.
And check out these lyrics: “I
went downtown looking for a
job. I looked at the holes ‘in my

Rico's Music Video Guide

jeans, and I turned
around and
headed back.”And
started a band and
made a video and
sold a million
records. How sad.
C’mon, Springsteen could get
away with that kind of blue-
collar melodrama ‘cause it wasn’t
posed —— he didn't look or act
like anything but a reg’lar Joe.
Social Distortion’s lead singer has
two arms full of tattoos that
probably cost as much as my
year’s rent, and he grimaces
enough during his boring guitar
solo to get Billy Idol worried.

3. D.N.A. featuring Suzanne
Vega — “Tom’s Diner.” When
someone told me about this song,

4"‘ ",.

S—3

I laughed. Vega’s quiet a cappella
poem turned into a house song?
But damn it, the crazy thing works.
Not like D.N.A. had to do a
helluva lot of work —— the only
change to the original are the
electronic drumbeat, an
occasional synth chord and the
looped “Do Do Do” chorus. Still,
it’s a neat idea, and the video’s
not too bad, either —— especially
the literal images accompanying
the lyrics (Vega sings “umbrella”;
we see a spinning umbrella).
Funny, but this is the second
instance in recent memory of a
folk singer hitting it big with a
dance version of an already
recorded song. (Beats

Director brings singular vision to Pitt'sStreetcar

By Ross Pasquale
For The Pitt News

“All the world’s a stage,” said
Shakespeare. But all the stage is
a ‘world to .Tracy Ginder—
Delventhal in her vision of
Tennessee Williams’ “A Streetcar
Named Desire” —— the inner world
of Williams’ linchpin character,
Blanche DuBois.

Ginder-Delventhal has been
developing this vision over a
number of years through
extensive research, repeated

readings and previous stagings.
Her vision focuses on Blanche
DuBois, the fading Southern belle
who arrives in New Orleans to
visit her sister and brother-in-law,
Stella and Stanley Kowalski.
Blanche’s past serves as the
impetus for the events of the
play, and her innermost fears are
personiﬁed by “ghoulies” —— a
background ensemble of
nightmare voices and bizarre,
disturbing players who torment
Blanche in her darkest hours.

production and found an original
page and a half of the script that
was cut, which was a montage of
sexuality, and death.” She has
restored these pages and
incorporated their images into
what she calls the “ghoulies.” In
the play, Blanche quotes Edgar
Allan Poe with the line, “the
ghoul-haunted woodland of
Weir,” which is a reference to his
poem “Ulalume.” Blanche’s
psyche parallels this haunted
woodland, and Ginder—
Delventhal has given it a voice in
the form of the additional cast.
Along with being ﬁgments of
Blanche’s, imagination, they
function as a set crew.
“Blanche’s past has chased her

  

to Elysian Fields [the play’s
setting]. [It] is the‘ reason why
Blanche lives the course of this
play  I felt it was very important
that the pastbecome a character
all its own. Tennessee was really
a visionary in terms of where he
thoughtAme rican theatre should
go,” said Ginder-Delventhal. She
utilizes these elements to create
an evocative environment rife
with pain and lust, hoping to
serve the needs of the play.
Ginder—Delventha1 is
originally from San Francisco,
and received her bachelor of
arts from Carnegie Mellon. She
recently completed graduate
work in directing there, earning
her masters of fine arts in

directing in May. ,,.,

After four months of deliberation
she cast her husband, Thom
Delventhal, as Stanley. The pros of
this connection are obvious: The
trust that must grow between actor
and director is already there. She
also expects him to disregard the
same fears that the other actors"?
have because he is her husband.

Ginder—Delventhal has had
original music composed for this
production to further achieve her
goal of what she calls the “dream
level” present in many of Williams’
works. In short,_she has attempted
to provide us with a distorted
looking glass of the death and.
desire in our world, and the
darkness in ourselves.

Tone Dogs throw art
rock‘ lovers a bone

By Manny Theiner
For the Pitt News

Seattle may be well-known‘ for
the Sub Pop label and its legion
of heavy, fuzz-drenched longhair
indie rockers such as Mudhoney
and Nirvana, but there’s another
scene there —— avant-garde and
experimental music —- which is
starting to come to light nationally,
thanks to the efforts of musician
and promoter Amy Denio.

Previously involved with the
art-pop bands Entropics (see the
LP Spagga! on Popllama) and
Couch of Sound, Denio has been
working for two years with a new
trio called Tone Dogs. The group
originally included Soundgarden
drummer Matt Cameron, and his
playing is still featured on the
Dogs’ recent record Ankety Low
Day, but the trio is now rounded
out by bassist Fred Chalenor and
drummer Will Dowd.

On the whole, AnleetyLowDay
proves that these Seattle upstarts
can swing, squonk and rock with
the big New York City Knitting
Factory art ensembles such as No
Safety, Curlew and Bosho. Denio
is quite an accomplished multi-

and Women Irnprovisors festivals. ,

Portland, Ore., resident
Chalenor’s no slacker either,
having participated in various
NYC musical projects with
everyone from Henry Kaiser to
Billy Bang.

The record bursts with
creativity, veering from layered
improv/noise to old-time jazz/
funk noodling to sweet pop
melodies, sometimes within the
course of a single song. Avant—
guru Fred Frith adds his guitar
rninistrations to the proceedings,
and the rarified result winds up
sounding like an unpretentious,
updated version of King

or that there isn't enough plot to
keep the strange and ﬂashing
images from having any coherent
meaning. To be honest, you will
not know what the story is about
until. the very ending, and even
then it’s ambiguous. But one
thing’s for sure —there is no
turning back once you ’ve begun.
In one scene, Lyne shocks us
with violent cuts to unidentiﬁable
monsters who seem to rape Jezzie
at a party. It’s all so real and scary,
but we never get to see anything
more than glimpses of the horror.
Instead of bombarding the
audience with unnecessary gore,
Lyne intercuts quick shots of
horribly deformed patients,

vibrating heads and obscure

images that are brieﬂy terrifying
because we have no idea what
they are. We do know, however,
that they are very, very strange.
During a terrible fever, in which
the thermometer goes off the
scale, Jezzie and the neighbors

cool‘ off Jake in a bathtub ﬁlled
with ice water. It is a scene almost
as visceral as the bathtub
sequence in Fatal Attraction but
more intense because of the stark,
nightmarish quality of the
bathroom. The white, hospital-
like setting is juxtaposed with
dreams of things past (his former
family and Vietnam experience)
and the violence of his dreams
(horns coming out of people's
mouths, throbbing heads). The
fast cutting and sharp contrast
makes us jump because it’s not
only unexpected, but it’s also so
dreamlike we become frightened
by its unreality. Things are so
strange and foreign that they are
absolutely terrifying.

Tim Robbins, who has gained
increasing star status over the last
few years in Bull Durham and
Cadillac Man, shows us a
surprisingly serious side to his
talents. He looks so genuinely
terriﬁed that I got chills every
time his eyes widened. He

Jacob sLadderis a horror movie
that cannot easily be categorized
as a genre ﬁlm. If you’ve seen
the trailer, it tends to deceive you
into thinking this is a regular,
suspenseful film like Fatal
Attraction. Fortunately, it is not.
Rubin and Lyne have given us a
film that violates the senses and
challenges the viewer to react
and think in completely different
ways, and no horror movie has
done that since Stanley Kubrick’s
7beShining. It is the most unusual
commercial movie this year, and
that is a problem for everyone
concerned. If Lyne doesn’t make
a decent buck with this expensive
ﬂick, though, he may have to
start all over again.

PIayhouse's La Cage

By Matt Goldstein
For The Pitt News

Jerry Herman’s musicals Mame
and Hello Dolly! are performed
around the world more often
than any other musicals to date,
making Mame and Dolly Levi the
most popular heroines of musical
comedy. Well, this time his score
backs up yet another dazzling
star, but behind the dresses and
glitz, she is a he!

Originally a comedy by Jean ‘

Poiret, a French playwright, La
Cage AuxFolles was made into a
film. It then became the basis for
the musical of the same title on
Broadway in 1983, with music
and lyrics by Jerry Herman and
book adapted by Harvey Fierstein
(T orcb Song Trilogy). The show
now has its Pittsburgh premiere
at the Pittsburgh Playhouse.
After being greeted by Georges,
the evening's master of
ceremonies and owner of La Cage
Aux Folles, a St. Tropez nightclub
featuring a chorus line of female
impersonators, we are introduced
to the club’s star and Georges’
lover, Albin, who becomes the
notorious ZaZa on stage. Georges’
son Jean-Michele, a result of a
one-night ﬂing many years ago,
returns home with the news that
he will be getting married. The

‘_ only problem is that his fiance

Anne’s father, an important
politician opposed to

‘ homosexuality, and his wife‘ are

on their way to meet the boy’s
parents. What to do now?

The predicament allows for
some comic mishaps reminiscent
of sitcoms. Everyone in this
production is a caricature,

lespecially Allen Stevens’

ﬂarnboyantAlbin, riotous at times,
and Tome Cousin’s Jacob, the
transvestite butler who demands
to be referred to as a maid.

Although lacking in subtleties
in their characterizations, it is not
hard to get swept up into the fun
of the whole evening and enjoy
it all. Under the direction of Danny
Herman and musical direction of
Pitt’s Nathan Hurwitz, the witty
lyrics (“We import the drinks that
you buy, so your Perrier is Canada
Dry!”) and catchy music, the show
ensures what Jerry Herman has
always intended; for the audience
to hum its way out of the theater.
The choreography, also by Danny
Herman, and much the same as
in the original production, is filled
with rousing tap numbers and
energetic bursts of cancan.

After the first act’s emotionally
charged finale and the show’s
credo, “I Am What I Am,”
delivered by Stevens, the second
act becomes very comic when
Albin is being instructed on how
to act masculine in order to pull
off the role of Uncle Jack forthe
future in—laws.

And it really gets screwball
when the girl’s parents finally do
arrive, Edouard and Mme. Dindon
(Don Brockett, seen across the
country as Chef Brockett on “Mr.
Rogers’ Neighborhood,” and
Barbara Russell), as far opposite
on the personality spectrum as
possible from La Cage Aux Folles.
But since this is a farce, that is
what makes the predicaments so
funny.

Dennis Kelly as Georges does
one of the most touching numbers
in the show", “Look Over There,”
in which he reminds his son
(Brett Kennedy) of the way Albin,
whom he is now casting aside,
has been a mother to him. For all
the quick one—liners and
spectacle, the message to accept
people for who and what they
are and to never be ashamed of
that is evident (if not beaten over
our heads).

A rip-roarin', cross-dressin' tirne: a scene from La Cage Aux Folles.

_ Joan Markert’s costumes for
the Cagelles are extravagant and
frilly, but some of the tighter-
fitting outfits, like the top hat and
tails, do not help disguise the
performers’ genders, due to the
small size of the theater. Jim
Ponder’s hair and makeup design
complete their look with heavily
painted faces to convey an eerie
look and successfully turn the
depressed Albin into the on—stage
ZaZa. Al Ortiz provides a beautiful
backdrop of the docks along the
French Riviera, alhough his set
for Georges and Albin’s apartment
appears cardboardy and drawn.

Panther Football hopes to reclaz’ fans’ rspect,

By Rob Mazur
Sta1fWriter

If you could describe the season
‘for the University of Pittsburgh’s
football team in one word it would
be “disappointing.” The Panthers
entered the season with visions
of ajan. 1 bowl game dancing in
their heads. That dream shattered
on a hot, sultry day at Memorial
Stadium in Norman, Okla. The
Panthers still could be at a major
bowl come New Year’s Day;
however, it will involve shelling
out about $40 plus airfare.

To salvage any degree of
respectability, the Panthers need
to win their two remaining games,
against arch-rival Penn State and
the upstart Temple Owls. Penn
State at University Park is always
an ’ interesting» task for the
Panthers, no matter how they are
doing that year. They cannot look
ahead to their season finale and
forget about Temple.

Temple enters this game with
the Panthers with an 4-4 record,

,better than the 3-5-1 Panthers.

The Owls enter the game with
the Panthers coming off of a
tough loss to the _ Tennessee
Volunteers. Winning at
Tennessee’s Neyland Stadium in
front of 94, 000 orange—and-white-
clad fans fired up by a
heartbreaking 9-6 loss to the
Alabama Crimson Tide and the
unofficial school song “Rocky
Top,” would be tough for No. 1
Notre Dame, let alone Temple.
The Owls held their own until

starting quarterback Matt Baker
went down with an ankle injury,
and the Owls lost 41-20.

Temple has come from behind
in three of its four victories.
Temple is led by Baker, who has
been an impressive 17-17 in the
fourth quarter during those
games. The Panthers may not
have to worry about keeping
Baker down because he is listed
as doubtful and is on a day-to-
day status. Without Baker the
Owls will start second-string
quarterbackAnthony Richardson.
Richardson is described by
Temple Coach Jerry Berndt as
“taller than Baker, with a stronger
arm. He gets more velocity on the
ball.” Richardson is . not
unaccustomed to the starting job,
either. He started Temple’s last
few games last year after Victor
Lay proved to be ineffective.

Still, the Panthers have not been
very, well, consistent this year.
They opened with two strong
wins, against Ohio University and
Boston College. They hit hard
times, losing big at Oklahoma,
escaping the Carrier Dome with a
tie and losing to West Virginia.
They defeated Rutgers but have
now gone almost a month without
a win. This game is the pivotal
point between a .500 record and
a losing season -— the Panthers’
first since 1984.

The main factor to the Panther
debacle this year has been the
injury situation. Players have been
forced into action when they

Pomt/oers my to ‘Salvage the Season ’ against Temple

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

Entering fall camp, the Pitt
football team’s battle cry was
“Raise the Level.” That meant
improving on an 8-3—1 record
and aTop 20 ﬁnish in 1989. It
meant returning to the single-
digit number rankings for the first
time in 1982. But somewhere
from August to November,
however, the team forgot to
include injuries, inexperience and
inconsistency. Thus, the new
slogan you hear now around Pitt
Stadium is “Salvage the Season,”

~ as in “If we win these last two

games, we will salvage our
season," and “We need these last

two games to salvage any kind of
season.”

At 3-5-1 with two games left,
that’s about all that’s left for the
Panthers in 1990. With wins
against Temple this Saturday and
Penn State on Nov. 24, the
Panthers hope to regain respect-
ability before their season ends.

It wasn’t supposed to be like
this. When Paul Hackett took
over the reins of the Pitt football
program last December, the team
was graduating several top
players, but a strong nucleus of
brash young kids were supposed
to mature into an even better
team in 1990. They were
supposed to spend New Year’s
Day in Tucson, Ariz., or Orlando,

Fla., not Bethel Park or
Monroeville.

If anyone had told Hackett in
August that Temple would have
a better record than Pitt when the
two teams played, he would have
laughed. He even laughed at the
notion this week.

“Yeah, I would have been very
surprised. There’s no doubt about
it, " said Hackett. “It's funny. I was
talking to Dick MacPherson of
Syracuse a couple of weeks ago,
and he was saying how good
Temple would be next year. He
said the same thing last year
about Louisville after [Syracuse]
played them at the end of the
season. I said ‘Yeah, [Louisville]
will be a good team,’ but I never

Swimmers face unique event list

By Jim Lakely
Sta_ﬁ' Writer

This Friday the men's swimming team will be

Panthers’ chances of winning. “We won’t need to
pull a rabbit out of our hat to win,” Davin said.
Next weekend Pitt has an important meet against

~ ’ challenging the talents of Clarion’s swimming team.

But for Pitt, the challenge is to stay competitive.

The meet‘ event list for the Clarion meet is
different than that of a typical college meet. The
usual events of the eight- lap butterﬂy or the eight-
lap backstroke will be replaced by 100-yard ﬂy,
back and breaststroke. Also, the 100-yard freestyle
will be replaced by the 1,650 free. '

“This is good for us because we haven’t seen that
event list this year, and we will be swimming it
again in the Conference tournament,” said Pitt
assistant swim coach Mark Davin. “We get to see a
lot of our swimmers in events that we haven't seen
them compete in yet."

The juggling of the lineup_shouldn’t affect the

national swimming power Virginia, and according
to Davin, these lineup changes will make the team
better prepared. _

Last weekend, Pitt traveled to St. Bonaventure
and then to Syracuse for a double meet with the
Orangemen and St. John’s. The Panthers nearly ran
in with a disaster. .

Pitt used a lighter lineup against the St.
Bonaventure Bonnies — perhaps looking past
them. But the Bonnies got Pitt’s attention. The
Panthers fell behind early and had to rally back and
sweep the last two events to secure the victory.

“We came in a little‘ ﬂat, and they were ready to
take us on,” said Davin. “We did not put much
mental preparation into St. Bonaventure because

See Swim, page P——9

thought they’d be this good. Now
it’s the same thing with Temple.
“You can learn a great deal
when you’re losing,” said Hackett.
“It’s not easy to take, but it can
make you much stronger at the
end. I'm convinced that what I’m
doing is right, but we can’t rest;
we’ve got to move on. That's
what this season is all about -
adjusting to adversity."

This was supposed to be the
season the Pitt football team
returned to the national picture
as one of the nation’s elite. Instead,
things have headed in the
opposite direction.

Going into Saturday’s game
against the Temple Owls, the
Panthers can only look back and
wonder, “What it?” If there is one
word that clearly describes the
Panthers’ season up to now it is
“disappointing.”

Hackett hasn’t made excuses 
changed his approach toward his
players.

Instead, he will go out and
recruit his kind of players: the
ones who will go to class, the
ones who will put out every play,
and most importantly, the kind of
players who think and don’t jump
offsides or hit quarterbacks 10
seconds after they release the
ball.

Those types of players and

Numerous sportswriters quoted
Alex Van Pelt as saying anything
short of a major bowl would be a
disappointment.

Van Pelt has been criticized for
instilling false assumptions into
other Panthers’ heads. What was
he supposed to say? How about
something like, “Well, I think that
going into the Temple game, we’ll
be 5-5-1. I’m really counting on
Curvin Richards to get hurt, so
opposing teams can blitz me and
rub my head all over the turf.”

I He would have been a real
media darling then and probably
behind nose tackle Joe Conlon
on the quarterback depth chart.
Even if Van Pelt was erroneous in
his forecast (which he was), you
have to admire the way he has
taken the heat. He was the team’s
unofficial spokesperson then, and
he’ll continue to be so next year
and hopefully the following
season as well.

are crying and calling for Coach
Paul Hackett’s job. But Hackett is
a patient man. His thinking is, let
the critics hammer us now; they

bandwagon down the road.

gendary Pitt non-successful head
coach Foge Fazio back in the
early ’80s.

Hackett is upbeat; he smiles
and offers reasons the Panthers
can gain from this season. “It
sounds corny, but losing teaches

character. Our players are facing‘?-

adversity now, but that’s life, and
some people don’t realize it, but
there is life outside football,”
Hackett said. “I want my players
to be exposed to the types of
things that make men stronger.”
Now, don’t get the wrong idea.
Hackett would love to be
undefeated and be sitting atop
the polls right now. But he isn’t,;
and he isn’t bitching and moaning.
He could easily blame this
season on injuries, suspensions
and bad breaks. But you would
be hard-pressed to hear him utter

words that sounded like cries.

Instead, he is teaching his
players about dealing wit

The Pittsburgh Penguins’
dramatic 7-6 victory Tuesday night

over the Calgary Flames was

certainly a huge win for the Pens,
but it also shed some light onto
the Penguins’ streaky start out of
the gate.

The Pens have won four straight
and are now 8-S1, still trapped in
ﬁfth place in the surprisingly tough
Patrick Division. The Pens
whupped the division-leading

New York Rangers on Saturday
and knocked off the best team in
hockey Tuesday—— proof positive
that when playing inspired,
conﬁdent hockey the Pens can
play with the best. We probably
all know this, but two big wins
over ﬁrst-place teams is the kind

' of reinforcement we could use

more often.
The re—emergence of T om
Barasso in the net for the Penguins

is an encouraging sign. Granted,
two periods of hockey does not
a season make, but Tommy B
turned away 26 Calgary shots
while holding down the fort for
the Pens’ late—game heroics.
Certainly Frank Pietrangelo was
hot going into the game, but he
got smoked for four Flames goals
in the first period and had to give
way to Barasso. Sticking with a
hot goalie is sound hockey
coaching, but Barasso has got to
be the Pens’ man. His play has
been erratic since the 1988-89
playoffs, when he played like the
top-notch goalie he is. Barasso’s
retum is the best news the
Penguins have received lately,
unless of course Mario Lemieux
returns as a Christmas present.
The dramatic improvement of
Zarley Zalapski, not only
defensively but offensively, is yet

another plus. Zalapski’s
improvement is entirely due to
his newfound conﬁdence, which
he seemed to ﬁnd eight games
ago in Buffalo. Since then the Z

Brian
Berger

man has played All-Star hockey.
Zalapski has returned to the point
on the power play where he has
an uncanny ability to keep the
puck in the attack zone and a
low, blistering shot that is often
on net. On defense Zalapski is
one of the toughest to beat one-
on—one and is tied for the team
lead in the plus-rninus ratings at
plus-10. The talent has always
been there; now Zalapski is

proving that he is a top-notch
NHL blueliner.

The Penguins’ offense. Simple
as that. Right now the Pens’ 70
goals are only second to Calgary,
which has played two more
games. This is no new territory
for the club, though, but what is
surprising is the consistent
improvement of the power—play
unit minus Mario. The Penguins
obviously have an awesome
amount of ﬁrepower, but Lemieux
meant a lot to the power play.
Last year the Pens folded down
the stretch minus Lemieux on the
man advantage. This year, with
the addition of Joey Mullen (7
power-play goals) and John
Cullen’s outrageous play, the
Pens’ power-play unit is
improving with every game. And
how about that lunatic Cullen?
He looks like the second coming

Penguins Starting to prove that Winning is no ﬂuke

of Denis Savard with those’

dazzling moves. Cullen has also
taken over as the leader of this
team. He sparked the late—game
winning rally on Tuesday by
setting up the ﬁnal two goals and
showing an incredible desire for

victory.

The Penguins’ road to the top 7’

doesn't get any easier in the next
two games. The ground birds
host the Norris Division-leading
St. Louis Blues tonight at the
Igloo, where the Blues have
owned the Pens the last couple
of years. On Saturday, the boys
travel to the Garden in Boston to

battle the Adams Division-leading
Bruins. Tough games, no doubt,

but these are the wins that prove
to the rest of the NHL and to fans
that this ride is for real and not
some hot streak that can burn

out.

CC team  
beads

to NCAA
regionals
Saturday

By Sharon Kerestes
Sta_[)“W1°iter

From Day 1 of the 1990
season, the men’s cross
country team has been
running with a speciﬁc goal
in mind: making it to the
NCAA Championships. This
weekend the team will have
the chance to turn its hopes
into reality.

Pitt will compete in the
NCAA Regional meet
Saturday at Yale University,
where a third-place finish
or better will qualify the
team for Nationals in
Knoxville, Tenn., on Nov.
19.

“We're to the point where
we just can’t wait to get
there and run,” said Keith
Dowling, Pitt’s No. 1 runner.
“We’re not nervous; we’re
just anxious to get running.”

Pitt has been competing
with that kind of enthusiasm
all season, facing each
challenge with confidence.
In September it broke Penn
State's 15-year winning
streak over Pitt by beating
tl‘1‘é Nittaiiy tibtiﬁ an its own
course. Two weeks later in
West Virginia Pitt beat
Bucknell, another longtime
rival. Then in October at
the Big East
Championships, the team
placed third behind
Providence and
Connecticut, with two of its
top five runners injured.

Pitt’s only other loss this
season was to N otre Dame,
then ranked eighth in the
country.

After losing to Notre
Dame, Lear said, if given
_another chance his team
was capable of beating the
Irish. That chance will come
at Nationals if the team
qualifies this Saturday.

Approximately 30 teams
will run in Pitt’s division
Saturday. The toughest
competition will come from
Georgetown, Bucknell,
Penn State, Navy and
William and Mary.

Pitt hasn't faced Navy or
William and Mary this
season, and it has already
beaten Penn State, Bucknell
and Georgetown.

William and Mary beat
Notre Dame in a dual meet
and is the designated “team
to watch out for.”

Still, Lear says his team is
confident.

“It's what you'd call a
calm conﬁdence," he said.
“They're just ready to run.”

we were looking to the meet
against Syracuse the next day.”

As Pitt is the defending Big East
champ, the other conference
teams are really gunning for Pitt,
and Syracuse had the Panthers in
its sights. It was a close meet
down to the end, and it came
down to the 400-free relay. The
winner of the event would win
the meet, and the Orangemen
prevailed. The loss was a real
eye-opener for Pitt.

“We went into the meet

knowing that Syracuse was going
to be tough, and [the Orangemen]
were really ready for us,” Davin
said. “We were not ready to race
those guys."
' Graduate assistant coach Mike
Kozlina was disappointed with

  

WANT A GREAT FIGURE?

the Panthers’ performance. “We
lost a lot of races thatwe shouldn’t
have,” he said. “Time-wise and
race-wise, I do not think we had
a good meet.”

Clarion will not present the
challenge of Syracuse or even of
St. Bonaventure, so the Panthers
will be using this meet to prepare
for their big meet against Virginia
on Nov. 17.

The swimmers will be
competing in their off events so
the coaches can better prepare a
lineup for the Virginia meet. “This
is our last tune—up before
Virginia,” said Davin.

Kozlina even went as far as to
make a prediction, although not
a risky one: Pittwill win for a very
simple reason. “We are a better
team,” he said.

normally wouldn’t have been.
The offensive backfield is a
microcosmic example of the

Panther injury situation.

Tailback Curvin Richards went

'down with a sprained ankle in
the Oklahoma game. He has
played sparsely since, irritating it
again in the Notre Dame game.
Reserves Kevin Williams and
Ricky Turner were lost in the
Miami game a week ago. This
means Glenn Deveaux has moved
from fullback to start at halfback.
He will be backed up by, Carl
Hagins. '

After Ronald Redmon went
down for the season with an
Achil1es’—heel injury, Glenn De-
veaux moved over to tailback.
"Given the present tailback de-
bacle, walk-on former wrestler
Lance Markel has been pressed
into service as the starting full-
back. “I just wanted to make a
contribution when I came out
here,” said Markel. “I never
expected to start. They needed
someone to take over, and I was
happy to fill in”,

Injuries haven't been the only
cause for missing players.
Disciplinary actions have lost
some players this year as well.

Lastweek, linebacker Terrance
Wheatley was suspended for the
season for violating team
standards. Hosea Heard was
suspended for two games earlier
this year. Jon Baker was sus-
pended for the Miami game.

“The amount of disciplinary
action isn’t unusual; as a matter
of fact, it’s less than last year,”
said Hackett. “When you change
coaches, players have to adjust to
a new set of rules. This year has
been a feeling-out process.”

Despite the injuries and
suspensions, other players have
come in to play and have
impressed both fans and coaches.
Some of these names are Joe
Conlon, Charles Williams, Markel,
Williams and Tinker Harris.

“I just wanted to play this year.
I never wanted to redshirt. It’s a
real honor to get to play as much
as I have,” said Harris, who rotates
in at left cornerback with senior
Marcus Washington.

Qualifying for Nationals has
been the team’s goal for the past
few years, but the belief among
team members wasn’t strong
enough.

“This year it’s a real live goal,”
Lear said. “These guys are sick of
not getting anywhere. So we’re
either going to make it, or we’re
going to die trying.”

“I love LA.

Magic and Worthy lead Lakers to Pacific division pinnacle

%I.

A

Magic Johnson’s Los Angeles
Lakers should challenge for the
league’s best record this year.
The playoffs and regular season
are completely different.

It is tough to prepare for Magic
(22.3 points per game, 6.6
rebounds per game, 11.5 assists
per game, 89.0 free-throw
percentage) and James Worthy
(21.1 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 54.8 ﬁeld-goal
percentage) without the
preparation time a playoff series
allows.

New coach Mike Dunleavy will I

emphasize defense and a passing/
perimeter game.

The versatile Sam Perkins (1 5.9
ppg, 7.5 rpg) was signed as a free
agent for a rather large sum and
will get starter’s minutes at all
three frontcourt spots.

Second-year man Vlade Divac
(85 ppg, 6.2 rpg) will be the
starting center, putting Mychal
Thompson in a more familiar,
comfortable reserve role.

The Portland Trail Blazers,
man for man, have the best 12-
man roster in the NBA.

Buck Williams’ (13.6 PPS. 9.8
rpg) arrival in Portland was the
main reason the Blazers led the
league in rebounding last year

   
   

$8“.

and look to rank highly in that
department again this season.

Danny Ainge (17.9 ppg, 6.0
apg) was acquired during the off-
season and gives the Blazers one
of those superior three-guard
rotations.

Guards Clyde Drexler (23.3
ppg, 6.9 rpg, 5.9 apg) and Terry
Porter (17.6 ppg, 9.1 apg) are
awesome.

Center Kevin Duckworth (16.2
ppg, 6.2 rpg) could rank with the
NBA’s elite if he was in top
physical condition.

Cotton Fitzsimmons says he is
staying on for one more year in
hopes_of guiding the Phoenix
Suns to the NBA title.

With the duo of All-Stars Kevin
Johnson (22.5 ppg, 11.4 apg) and
forward Tom Chambers (27.2 ppg,
7.0 rpg), they - are serious
contenders.

Johnson is the league’s best
pure point guard, while Chambers
is the game's best shooting big
man.

Center Mark West (10.5 ppg,
8.9 rpg, 62.5 fgp) is an immovable
object in the paint. Jeff Hornacek’s
(17.6 ppg, 5.0 apg) total game is
coveted by general managers
around the league.

The Pr

K.C. Jones is a head coach
once again, this time with the
Seattle Supersonics.

Jones favors an up—tempo game
which” will suit Rookie of the
Year candidate point guard Gary
Payton (Oregon State).

Payton should give the Sonics

Michael
Milliron

their best ﬂoor leader since that
Dennis Johnson guy left town.

If guard Dale Ellis (23.5 ppg)
can drive safely off the court, he
gives Seattle one of the premier
shooters in the NBA

The Sonics continue to look
for a natural center, but they
should just give the job to Olden
Polynice and see what he does.
Xavier McDaniel (21.3 ppg, 6.5
rpg), Derrick McKey (15.7 ppg,
6.1 rpg), Michael Cage (9.7 ppg,

10.0 rpg) and Shawn Kemp give;

Jones a lot of options at the

(21.1 ppg, 6.7 rpg), Ken Norman
(16.1 ppg, 6.7 rpg) and Danny
Manning (16.3 ppg, 5.9 rpg) are a
fine trio of forwards.

Point guard Gary Grant (13.1
ppg, 10.0 apg) is a future star but
must reduce his turnovers.

Center Benoit Benjamin’s (13.5
PP8, 9.3 rpg, 2.6 bpg) play will be
a deciding factor as to whether
the Clips make a run at the
playoffs.

Rookie guard Bo Kimble
(Loyola Marymount) must provide
adequate play until Ron Harper
(22.8 ppg, 5.9 FPS. 5.2 apg) returns
from injury in January.

Golden State Warriors’
innovative coach Don Nelson gets
everything he can out of his
players.

Unfortunately they do not have
much defense or rebounding to
give him.

Scoring is not a problem with
point man Tim Hardaway (14.7
