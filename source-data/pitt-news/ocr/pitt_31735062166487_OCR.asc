Student Congress Hears

Final Evaluation Report

By DIILLARD AMDUR

At the Student Congress

meeting of Monday, May 13,

the main order of business was the presentation of the ﬁnal
report of the Committee for Evaluating Student Govern-

ment.

This committee, representing faculty, alumni, and

student interests, has been at work since November.
Besides examining strengths and weaknesses of existing

structure, the c 0 m m i t t e e hase

evolved a plan which is designed
to supplement the strong points
of the present program as well as
“to include responsibilities hereto-
fore untouched by students which
should be included in the scope
of student government.

The committee has dealt with
the major areas of purposes, pow-
ers, structure, and representation
in formulation of plans for one
In aj or University governmental
organization. The new body is
called by- the committee The<Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Student Gov-
ernment Association. _

The seven-member committee
was from November to February
chaired by Irving Rothman. Upon
his graduation, Bob Lancaster,
who delivered the ﬁnal report to
Cpngress, assumed the chairman-
ship.

One of the most helpful re-‘
ports done elsewhere was that
of UCLA. This report included
listing of structures and repre-
sentation for 28 colleges and
universities.

The committee very soon after
their study began came to the
conclusion that no prevalent plan
for student government exists.
Furthermore, each school must de-

velop ‘governmental p r o g r a m s .

suited to speciﬁc needs through
‘careful study and experience.

Examine Education

“The grants make it possible
for us to examine systematically,
and with the aid of some of the
best minds in the country, our
whole educational program. They
make it possible for us to make
these ceremonies also the inaug-
uration of new programs of order-

new national role which the trus-
tees hope for this University and
which we together are pledged to
deﬁne, seek, and accomplish.” ‘

The A. W. Mellon Educational
Charitable Trust has contributed
toward bringing to the University,

leaders in public health and grad-
uate studies and also in humani-
ties. The humanities seminar also
was aided by a grant from the
Pitcairn-Crabbe Foundation.

The Sarah Scaife Foundation
aided programs in the ﬁelds
of medicine, dentistry, and nurs-

ported the learned meetings in
education, engineering, and na-

GOTTA EXTRA CIGARETTE, ED?

letters To The Editor

If anyone at any time wishes to epress his opinion
publicly on a topic which is of prime concern to him, he
has nothing to lose in trying to have his thoughts pub-
lished in the Pitt News through a letter tothe editor.

It has long been the tradition on this newspaper to
printall letters which were not outright slander whenever
space permits. No letter is ever suppressed for bearing
opinions contrary to that of the editorial staff. NO letter
is ever withheld in fear of controversy. The enthusiastic
agreement and disagreement with the editorial opinion of
the paper which is epressed by readers provides the editor
with a current and ever-changing variety of topics for
discussion.

It is sure death to the newspaper editor to cut him-
self off from this criticism. In the Pitt News of May 14,
1956, there appeared a column entitled, “The Slings and
Arrows.” This article told, in great detail the importance
of the critic. It would be hypocrisy to hold any right for
the newspaper to criticize if the same right is not grant-
ed to the reader. -

The newspaper, however, is reasonable for all that is

‘printed, whether it is written by the staff or-by the reader.

It must then be left to the editor’s discretion to print or
withhold all written matter, columns orlletters. No ed-
itor pin a college newspaper‘ would betray his Own honor
and withhold criticism of his paper to save his own name.
Too much time has been spent in the production of the
paper for him to hold himself in a more important posi-
tion than the paper.

The Letters To The Editor column is printed for the
purpose of carrying readeropinion, when pertinent. There
is no space in the newspaper or in the minds of the general
public for those who haven’t the guts to publicly criti-
cize.

Liberal Arts Grads . . .

 

Job Opportunities 

By Walter H. Rittenaur
(Editor’s Note: This is the first of two columns
by Walter H. Rittenaur, assistant director of the
Placement Bureau, concerning job opportunities
for the Liberal Arts graduate.)

In spite of the use of bulletin boards and the
columns of the Pitt News we find many students
who are not aware of the service Offered by the
Placement Bureau, We are especially eager to talk
to liberal arts students because we feel that they
are‘ in need of some vocational counseling, and be-
cause opportunities are opening up for the liberal
arts graduate.

The liberal arts students are particularly in
need of counseling because there is a great deal
of misinformation to the effect, on one hand, that
the world is waiting for them with open arms,

and, on the other hand, that there are no oppor-

tunities at all.

The following information presents ‘a picture
in the Pitt Placement Bureau. One fundamental
principle of vocational guidance“ is that the stu-
dent should seek information from several sources.
There are opportunities for the liberal arts gradu-
ate, but so many of them are’ trying to batter
down doors that will not open, while other doors
are wide open, and employers are pleading for
personnel. It would seem better to at least con-

sider some of these open doors.

Teaching Field '

First let us consider the ﬁeld of teaching, and
first in the ﬁeld of teaching—college teaching.
Judging by the number of requests in our ﬁles
for college teachers and administrators, the ﬁeld
must be opening up as never before. I would like

to recommend a very ﬁne article in the booklet _
“Career Opportunies,” published by ‘the Harvard,

Crimson. The article on opportunities in college
teaching is written by Dean McGeorge Bundy.
Dean Bundy says that “when higher learning is
chosen for its real meaning, there is no ﬁner life.”
He points out that a long period of apprenticeship
is necessary, and that brings up the subject of
graduate school. I would like at this time to in-
dicate that the new administration intends to con-
information about fellowships, and
assistantships in the hands of the University Coun-
-selor, so that there will be a central place where
students ﬁnd out if it is possible for them to go on.

Pending the time when the Counselor is ready \

to provide this service, the Placement Bureau and
the various departments have considerable infor-
mation. I did 'a little investigating on my own the
past few days and discovered that here at Pitt we

have the Owens Fellowship which provides a thou- _

sand dollars, and the Heinz Loan Fund and Mellon
Fund‘ with money available for graduate work.
We have, in addition, a ﬁle in our office on fellow-
ships available at other universities. The Over-
whelming majority of college positions require at
least a master’s degree and many require a doc-
tOr’s degree.

At this point I will inject a thought which comes
to me from my mentor, Dr. Hutson, of the School
of Education. Dr. Hutson pointsnout that in educa-

Crashing Through . . .

10%

tional literature a great deal. of wailing is done
about the high school drop-out, the boy or girl
who leaves high school before graduation. Equally
important is the problem of the higher education
drop-out——the capable college graduates, capable
of going on to master’s degrees and doctor’s de-
grees, and thereby enriching our culture,» but who
fall by the educational wayside. A vast amount
of money in student loan funds is actually not
used every year. Would it not be worth gambling
on your future a bit, by‘ equipping yourself for
college work? The salaries of the future, Dean
Bundy believes, will “because of the law of sup-
ply and demand, be much more sensible.”

Critical Shortage ,

While we are on the subject of teaching may I
point out that there is a critical shortage of high
school teachers; yes, even in the ﬁeld of histohy,
and this shortagenwill get worse. If you have the
courage, the leadership ability, and if you like
kids, you may ﬁnd great pleasurein teaching his-
tory in one of our public high schools.‘

Public schoolrteachers salaries have improved
greatly in the last few years and, once again, the
law of supply and demand, will bring greater im-
provement. Maximum salaries of $8000 for straight
teaching are not uncommon now. I just left the
public school in November, and I know that there
are many schools where it is still possible to main-
tain standards of scholarship. Students will have
to be certiﬁed to teach and that meansthat they
will have to complete a year of graduation work in
the School of Education. Loan funds and fellow-
ships are available for those who intend to do
this work on a graduate basis.

Dr. Frank Endicott, Director of Placement at
Northwestern University, Are'ce’ntl.y issued his
“Eleventh Annua1,Endicott Reports of Trends in
the Employment of College and University Gradu-
ates in Business and Industry.” Two hundred com-
panies with 923 recruiters made 8989 visits’ to cam-
pus schools averaging 45 schools per company. Be-
cause of increased interest in the employment of
graduates in liberal arts, the responding companies
were asked to indicate what percentage of college
men were hired last year who could have qualiﬁed
by graduating from a liberal arts college. One hun-
dred ninety companies replied that 37% of all jobs
could have been ﬁlled by the liberal arts graduates.
However, only 27% were actually hired.

I can only speculate about the reasons why the
failed. Six months of observation in the
Placement Ofﬁce leads me to believe that a larger
portion of the 10% failed because they did not ex-
emplify the very qualities which a true liberal ed-
ucation is supposed to produce. " 

There are opportunities for the liberal arts
graduate who is careful about his appearance,
poised in manner, shows evidence of a cultural
background, express himself well, participates in
extra—curricular activities, and has shown some‘
evidence of leadership in those activities. Three
members of the February class who measured up '
to these qualiﬁcations were placed ‘at»~salaries_-
greater than $400 per month.

Because of
the closeness of
central European countries and
the frequent exchange of mater-
ials and people between the
countries, it is natural for Eu-
ropeans to understand the peo-
ples surrounding them, said the
doctor. . '

learned French, German, Italian,
and Spanish early and could
speak them fluently before he
was of college age.

Recently, he was
North American companies to
contact, and he has found this
ﬁfth language, English, a bit
harder to use fluently.

How surprising! Here, we are
students of one of the largest

college producing nations in the-

world, and we are lucky if we
can struggle through our own
language, let alone one other
language such as the French or
Spanish some of us had to know
to enter college.

Several weeks ago various
people were honored for leader-
ship service, and scholarship.
Compared to today’s Pitt and
American citizens, perhaps these
people are “tOp.” But go any

What a shame that our .isolat- ‘

words before their throats are
accustomed to just one language

Perhaps we can ﬁnd artiﬁcial

(Continued from Page 1)
Inﬂuential Groups
Members of the committee found
that many student government or-
ganizations have inﬂuential groups
represented along with class and
school units.
The stated purposes include ex-
pressing student opinion, provid-
ing an effective means of ‘commu-
nication between students and ad-
ministration, and stimulating an
atmosphere of intellectual growth.
The more general support of
-the total educational experience
through extra-curricular activi-

,ties and appreciation of demo.-
cratic values also are basic to
the new ‘program.

In the area of powers, some of"
the most drastic changes have en-
sued. The SGA controls all stu-
dent organizations and activities
by granting recognition and pos-
sibly withdrawing recognition
from all student organizations.
The SGA would supervise, co-or-
dinate, and delegate authority.

- Fund Allocation
.Another power as yet totally

I new to student government at the

University is the allocation of
funds to organizations and activi-
ties. Ideally, then, the SGA would‘

-wreceive into. its account funds to
be distributed to organizations,

coming from Student
Fees, et al.

The SGA would regulate student
conduct in three ways. First, the

Activity

' governmental group would control

the eligibility of students partici-
pating in organizations and ac-

. tivities.

They would establish an honor
code. Lastly, SGA would pro-
vide for a judicial system of en-
forcement. It appears that a
vastly’ enlarged scope of power
and responsibility would rest in
the new group.

The Student Government Asso-
ciation would be an attempt to
assure representation for all full-
time students in the University.
Duplication would theoretically be
eliminated. The committee recog-
nized inherent values in existing
structures; t h e y

Send One Member
Each school, living unit, and
activity area would send one of
its members as a representative

.—to SGA. The committee encour- .
V ages the six undergraduate schools

to construct individual governing
bodies composed of all the classes
within the school.

Mens Council and Women's
Council (WSGA) would be classi-
ﬁed as activity areas, and, as such,
each would have one voting re-
presentative in SGA.

One of the bones of contention

-at the meeting was the minimiz-

ing in authority and scope of
Men’s Council and WSGA. They

‘would represent only the segre-
T gated activity interests since the

T breaks. He believes a lot will de-
pend, however, on how the breaks
materalize.

The Nittany Lions do not have
as strong a team as they have had
in the last several seasons, but
they have a formidable outﬁt,
 headed by Rod Perry, that could
cause the Blue and Gold some
anxious moments before’ the ﬁnal
result is in. ,

Perry To Run Hurdles

In their last meet, a triangular
affair with Ohio State and Michi-
, gan State, the Lions placed third
- whereas the locals were barely
'  nipped by Notre Dame in the ﬁnal
event of their duel.

State’s strongest events are
the 120- yard high hurdles and
the 220-yard low hurdles where
they have Perry. Last week
Perry had little trouble scoring
a double in the high and low
hurdles at East Lansing, Mich.
He raced over the high barriers
in :14.5 and the low barriers in
:23.6. In the low hurdles he
edged OSU’s great Glenn Davis,
and teammate Dick Winston, a
"superior hurdler in his own
right,Ehad to be contented with
the No. 3 spot.

The Panther coach, commenting
on the hurdles, says, “Our hurd-
lers (Paul Thrash and Bob Rus-
sell) will have their work cut
out for them this Saturday.”

Strong Dash Trio
One important factor that could
‘sway the ﬁnal result is the Blue
and Gold’s strength in the dashes.
Coach Olson will send his_
formidable trio of Herb Carper.
‘Jim Donahue, and Jay Moody
to the starting blocks in the
‘100’ and ‘220.’
Penn State will counter with

 man they have with a chance to
  beat out Carper, Donahue, and
Moody.

The half-mile, mile, and two-

   

remarkable performances:

 

Winston who seems like the only '

mile runs present a different out-
look because the Lions have some
of the top distance men in the
East in Jerry Norton, Ed Moran,
and Fred Kerr.

Norton, a former New Jersey
high schol state champ, will be
entered in the ‘440’ and possibly
the ‘880.’ _

Moran, a good half-miler who
placed third in the IC4A classic
last year, will run in the mile.

Kerr, an ex-Pennsylvania high
school _champ in the mile, will
compete in the two-mile run.

Top Vole Vaulters
The Centre County thinclads
also have some outstanding per-
formers in the pole vault, discus,
and shot put.
In the vault, they have Harry
Fuehrer and Ogie Norris to
,challenge the Panthers’ ace—-
Billvsmith. At the indoor IC4A’s
during the winter, this duo
edged Smith for top laurels.

N etters Hope to RegainWinning
Touch Against Carnegie Tech

Coach Ben Pope’s‘netters will try to break their two-
meet losing streak when they welcome Carnegie Tech to
the Mellon Court starting at 2 p.m. tc-day. C

The Panther netmen suffered two stinging setbacks over
the weekend to West Virginia and0
Navy which put their season’s
record at 2-3. They lost to the
Mountaineers on Friday, 6-3, and
to the Midshipmen on Saturday,
9-0. '

_ Today’s match with the Plaid
shouldn’t prove as tough as the
West Virginia and Navy meets,
but Coach Pope feels that his
court team will still have to
show plenty of hustle in order
to take the pesky Tartans.
The freshman coach is expect-
ed to remain with the same lineup
that started last Saturday, at

Navy.

This means that Bill King, Neal
Zweig, Bill Swaney, Don Isaac,
Dave Bonebreak, and Bernie
Ravish will represent the Blue
and Gold in the singles competi-
tion.

The doubles will ﬁnd King
teaming up with Zweig, Swaney
working with Isaac, and Bone-
break playing with Ravish.

After the match with the Plaid,
the Jungle Cat netmen have
meets scheduled ‘with West Vir-
ginia, Penn State, and Duquesne.

Mitters’Tournament ROTC Riflers
Chances Improving

By

MURRAY CHASS

Bobby Lewis’ red-hot Panther nine will try to further
enhance chances for a post-season bid to the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tournament this week
as they engage Allegheny at home tomorrow and Navy at

Annapolis on Saturday.

Right now, the local mitters, who have won seven out of

their last nine contests and have a"‘

season record of 9-7, are more than
ever in the running for that play-
off bid. T h e ‘

offs which will
include all Dis-
trict champions. Although last
week’s 7-2 loss to Duquesne hind-
ered the Panthers’ chances, they
could still receive a bid if they
impress the selectors in their ﬁnal
games with West Virginia, Penn
State, and the Dukes.
Lewis Optimistic

But Lewis, remains non-com-
mittal. “Those last ones are the
ones that count,” says the young
Jungle Cat mentor. “I'll wait un-
til the end of May before offering
a guess on our chances for the
NCAA .. tournament.”

In those last seven victories,
Lewis has received some good
hurling from three members of
hi". mound staff. Bill Hamilton,
a ﬁrst year Panther flinger, has
been the most surprising thus
far. A

 

J axel

Hamilton owns three of those
seven wins over West Virginia,
Clarion Teachers, and St. Vincent.
He has been charged with one de-
feat, that being to tough Ohio
State. "

Play Allegheny Tomorrow

Carl Lindstrom has captured his
only decisions of the season in
this streak, wins over California
Teachers and St. Vincent.

Ronnie Moog, the Panther cap-
tain, lost his first contest during
these last nine, but he also picked
up two victories. The setback
came against the Dukes, and the
triumphs were in the Westminster
and Bucknell battles.

Skipper Lewis will choose his
starters for ’the two upcoming
games from this trio. Allegheny,
a near-by team with not too
much punch, should be merely
a tune-up for the Panthers. The
game at Mellon Field gets un-
der way at 3 p.m. .
Tomorrow’s rivals have played
one common foe, Westminster.
The Cats overpowered the Titans,
16-3, while the Gators lost their
tussle this past Saturday, 7-6.
Allegheny plays a schedule made
up mostly of small, local schools
anddoes not have the necessary
power to scare the Panthers.

Navy Hot

On Saturday the Panthers will
ﬁnd a tougher foe in the Middies.
In 17 games thus far, the Naval
nine has won eleven, lost ﬁve and
tied one. The tie came about when
rain halted the Villanova contest
with the score 2-2. .

Navy, too,‘ is currently in a
hot streak, having won eight
out of the last eleven games.
One of these victories. was over
Cornell, 3-2, a team that down-
ed the locals, 6-3. Penn State
defeated them last Tuesday,
8-5. ‘

Capture Title
In First Effort

The Pitt Air Force ROTC took
ﬁrst place honors in the newly
organized Western Pennsylvania
Collegiate Riﬂe League with a 5-1
record for the season.

The riﬂe league, just organized
‘this year, is comprised of
AFROTC teams from Grove City,
Allegheny College, and the Clar-
ion State Riﬂe Club, a civilian
team.

Allegheny came in second
with a 4-2 record while Grove
City placed third with a 3-3
mark. Clarion brought up the
cellar slot with 0-6.

Sgt. John J. Cable, coach of the
Pitt AFROTC, and his squad of
Gene Ross, Larry Duquette, Jack
Cayton, Bob Thompson, Earl
Sciler, and Gene Ort set a league
record with a score of 1813 for
four positions (standing, sitting,
kneeling, and prone) out of a pos-
sible 2000.

Midshipman coach, Max Bishop,
who is in his twentieth season as
head baseball coach at the Aca-
demy, has one regular hitting
above .400 and another three over
the .300 mark.

' Right ﬁelder Ed Stewart is slug-
ging the pellet at a .404 clip and
also leads in runs batted in with
12. Mike Willen, the Middie first
sacker, is hitting .350 with 11
RBI’s, and second baseman Joe
McGlinchey has a .300 average
and has produced the same num-
ber of runs. I

The, other batter above the
magic mark is John Mascali, the
backstop, at .345. The Midship-
men are not much of an extra-
base ball club. They have swatted
only four home runs in the 17
‘games.

Leading the’ pitching corps are .

Ben Montoya and Dick Smith.
Montoya has won four out of ﬁve
contests and is in with a 1.37 ERA
while Smith is unbeaten in four
tries and has given up 2.95 runs
a game.

Vrosli Baseballers See Action

The frosh baseball team will
take on the Central Catholic High
School nine at Trees Field tomor-
row in a practice game.

The yearlings will then travel
to Kiski on Saturday to engage

the Prep School squad. Coach!

Dave Starrett is looking forward

to his team’s showing as ﬁnre a.

form as it did in its win over
Shadyside for these two contests.
The locals’ game with the West
Virginia freshmen was cancelled
when the Mounties could not get
transportation connections.

 

HAVE YOU TRIED
THIS EASY TEST?

Here’s an interesting way to
test. a summer shirt for cool-
ness. Have your friends truss
you up like a barbecued pigs
and put you on a spit. Then
have them light a roaring ﬁre
underneath you. Then get
somebody to keep turning you,
slowly and deliberately, over
the crackling ﬂames. Do you
feel the heat? Do annoying
beads of perspiration break
out on your forehead and neck?
Are you uncomfortable? Does
your collar wilt, wrinkle and
curl? In fact, do you generally
dislike the test? V
If any one of these things
happen, you’re not wearing a
Van _ Heusen Century Sheer,
the summer shirt that’s about

the coolest you can buy and
which features the famous
one-piece soft collar that can’t
wilt or wrinkle, no matter
how hot or humid it gets.
The Van Heusen Century
sheer Shirt is the summer ver-
sion of the great Van Heusen
Century Shirt. It’s made of
pique, that featherweight, cool-
weave fabric, launders beau-
tifully and (we repeat) it’s
impossible to wrinkle its
collar. Takes no starch either,
so it’s always soft and com- I
fortable. See it at your campus
haberdasher. He’s got the
Van Heusen Century Sheer
in several collar styles. $4.00.

Satirical Romance,

Radkoff To Direct

AThe conﬂict between one’s
ideals and one’s desire for
ﬁnancial security—that is the

‘essence of the romantic and

satirical Y Playhouse produc-
tion “Beggar on Horseback”

to be presented on May 25 and
May 26, at the YM & WHA on
Belleﬁeld Avenue.

Written by George S. Kaufman
and Marc Connelly, it is concern-
ed with the dream of a young

— composer who imagines that he

is marrying an unattractive girl
for her money. The play has to do
with the adventures, distorted by
his imagination, that come to film
as a slave of gold and an impossi-
ble family.

Directed by Pittsburgh Opera’s
Technical Director, Steve Rad-
koif, this play has been chosen as
the vehicle with which to revive
the» Y’s Playhouse.

In the role of Neil McCrae, torn
between struggling until he wins
recognition as a composer or
marrying Glady Cady for her
money, is Phillip Reilly, who has
performed with both the Pitt
Players and the Pittsburgh Civic
Ballet.

Susan Marshall will be seen as
the unattractive, but wealthy
daughter Gladys, and Marlene
Koonsivitsky as Cynthia, the tal-
ented designer who decided to
give Neil up so that he can marry
Gladys and write the kind of
music she believes he is capable
of writing.

In the role of Dr. Albert Rice,
the friend who believes Neil
should marry for money, is
Arthur Plotkins who has had ex-
perience in the Russian Theater

T , sponsored by Middlebury College.

remain influential, and the grad-
uate schools would each be re-
presented. Six members-at-large
would be elected, two of whom
would have to be seniors.

From these six would be drawn
the officers of the SGA since it is
recognized that most of the repre-
sentatives of the three areas
would have far too much respon-
sibility to assume any others.

The committees, chairmen of
which would be. members of

 

SGA, remain somewhat the same
as they presently are in Student
Congress with the exception of
Honor Code, Judiciary, and
Committee on Recognition of
Student Organizations.
"Student Congress plans to dis-_
cuss in committee the program
thus outlined and then draw up a
report for Dr. Peake, assistant
chancellor for student affairs.
After his approval, a constitution
might be arranged.

piece of metallic copper was dis-
covered in Ontonagon County,
