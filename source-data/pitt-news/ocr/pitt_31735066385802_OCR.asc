UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH
Computer fee increase
delayed until fall 1991

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

Student Government Board
President Julie Shepard
announced at the board’s weekly
meeting Thursday night, that the
new computer fee would not
increase until the fall of 1991

The fee, which has been the
source of some controversy since
its creation last year, was
scheduled to double from $55 to
$110 next fall. But according to
Shepard, the increase won’t be
needed for another year.

“Right now, the university is
paying back the interest on some
bonds that they own,” she said.
“But in 1991, they won’t be able
to depend on the income from
these bonds, thus, the increase.”

Shepard said that the computer
fee would be used for updating
the PittCAT system and the ISIS
system in the library. She also
said it would help improve video
services to classrooms, the on-

line library catalog and the
student—information system. “It’s
not just for the computers
themselves; it’s for the campus of
the future,” she said.

Shepard also said that she has
not received a deﬁnite answer
from Pitt President Wesley Posvar
as to how much tuition will
increase next year.

“-He told me that tuition would
go up no more than the cost of
living," she said, adding, “You
can take that any way you want.”

SGB member Bob Batchelor
confirmed that statement. “There
has been no response from Posvar
on the tuition hike,” he said.

Shepard also questioned the
results of a recent survey given
by some graduate students
concerning the new campus
housing. She said that the survey,
which was held in late August,
was only given to 1,000 students,
split evenly between graduate
and undergraduate students. The

Sexual orientation
clause ()II1itt€d
from time schedules

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

Homophobia throughout the entire university is the reason why the
sexual- orientation clause has been left out of the College of Arts and
Sciences’ time schedules for the spring/summer and fall semesters,
according to a co-president of the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance.

“[The clause] belonged in there,” said Stacy Winters, “espedially
when it has been approved by the university.”

According to Polly Stabile, systems and developments coordinator
for the Admissions Office, the next time schedules will contain the

whole anti—discrirnination policy.

“We were informed by the Affirmative Action Committee,” she said.
“I didn’t even know the policy had been updated.”

However, Winters said that ignorance of university policy was not
an excuse and that the administration should have made sure that
everyone knew that the clause had been added when the change

occurred two years ago.

“I think it perpetuates the problem,” she said. “Everyone should
have known it was in effect. If it had to do with racial origin, it

wouldn’t have been forgotten.”

Student group questions SGB at

Sandy Paul
For The Pitt News

Two student-grou p conferences
held over the weekend spurred a
conﬂict between student leaders
concerning funding for on—campus
events.

“Student Activism in the 1990s,”
a conference sponsored by Pitt
and Carnegie Mellon’s Common
Ground Coalition, was held Friday
and Saturday. Various student-
activist groups gathered to hold
workshops geared toward
building and maintaining student

groups.

A similar leadership conference,
sponsored by the Student
Government Board and Student
Activities, was also held over the
weekend addressing many of the
same issues at the activism
conference.

The coordinator for “Student
Activism in the 1990s, ” Traci Darin,
said that the conference was not
treated as an equal to the SGB
conference as far as funding was
concerned.

Darin, who is also co—founder
of Concerned Leaders for

After 29 years of serving the

closed for the final time on

Friday.

An empty University Shop closed its door Friday for the last time.

Brackenridge Hall, was not
scheduled to close until April
30, when its lease expired. The
university decided in February
not to renew the lease with the
shop’s owner, Jay McKenzie,
because it wanted a place of its
own to sell Pitt merchandise.
Ben Dines, who worked at
the store for eight years, said

Heidi e White/T he Pitt s

that he thought McKenzie
wanted to get out as soon as
possible.

“I think he felt that enough

wanted to get out of there as

Dines said that he does not

claims that funding for the
conference was requested six
weeks in advance, yet 95 percent
of the funding was not granted.

Funding forms for both CLEAN
and the conference were turned
in by Darin at the same time.
However, “Four of the most
important forms were lost [by
SG B] ‘quote—unquote,”’ Darin said.
These forms included money
necessary to make ﬂyers to
publicize the conference.

The SGB Allocations Chairman
Gil Borok responded by saying,

“If the forms were lost, they could
have come to me, and we could
have worked something out,
because I’ve done it for other
groups.”

Darin also said, “We asked for
$60 to $80 to have coffee at the
brunch.” The coffee was denied.

Borok explained, “Student
government will only fund money
for food for recruitment.”

However, the activism-
conference goals printed at the
top of the program read, “To
recruit new members into and
develop leadership within the

llocation of funds

participating student groups."
Darin said that a copy of the goals
was given to the SGB.

Borok’s recollection was that
money for coffee was not granted
for one of two reasons: either the
recruiting goals were not made
clear enough or the $200
recruiting allowance had been
exceeded.

He noted that the funding
procedure is very complicated
and goes according to the rules.

The rules permit funding for
SGB conferences such as the

.,AIDS awareness promoted through art and dance

By Lisa Pugliese
Staff Writer

All of the dancers at Thursday
night’s production of Before
Forever were dimly dressed in
gray — all except one, that is.

"' This male member of the

production vividly stood out
among the others, primarily
because he was wearing a red
baseball hat, and also because
he was diagnosed with AIDS.
Based in Philadelphia,
Danceteller, a modern—dance and
theater ensemble, uniquely
combined the two elements of

¢ the stage Thursday night at the

William Pitt Union to create a
“work of art” about people living
and struggling with AIDS.

The ensemble bases itself on
the premise that “movement and
theater have been signiﬁcantly
intertwined since the earliest
records of humankind.” Thus, in
works which the company creates

I and performs, audiences ﬁnd the

performers appearing both as
dancers and as speaking actresses
and actors.

Robert Barnett, a playwright
and creator of Before Forever,

traveled the eastern United States
with the ensemble, interviewing
people living with AIDS.

All of the dialogue in the
production, some used in voice-
overs and some spoken by the
performers, has been selected
from Barnett’s taped interviews.

As the group tours nationally,
additional interviews of people
with the AIDS virus are planned
to be recorded and eventually
integrated into the show.

Through exaggerated dance
movements, the performers
attempt to project the struggling
of AIDS patients with feelings of
loneliness, as well as how they
deal with the disease itself.

“I’d do a lot for love,” said one
of the performers. “But I’m not
ready to die for it.”

According to the taped
interviews, the physical intimacy
of a hug is all AIDS patients are
often asking for. The majority of
the time though, because of public
ignorance about the disease, they
are isolated.

Also projected through the
performance is the idea that a
number of people are totally
ignorant to the fact that AIDS is

He openly criticized the
university for not renewing the

said. “He was good to Pitt. He

“jay cared for the students. All
the university cares about is its
pockets.”

When he was originally given
the notice, McKenzie said that it
was “a little bit of a shock."

“They’re not renewing my lease;
I guess that’s an eviction,” he
said.

Sandy Bergad, who has worked
there almost since the store’s
creation, said that what Pitt did
was “a slap in the face. They
forget all about tradition and
loyalty.”

“There was a mean, mad, gay

so that all gay people could die,”
said one of the performers during

“There’s an old saying that if

Asst. News Editor

Next year's Black Action Society
chairperson warned the
university community that the
organization will be more self-

“ determined and controversial

next year in an interview during
Friday’s “Meet the Candidates"
night.

“The warning, is this,” said
chairperson candidate Doug
Ligons, “We’re going to start
deciding for ourselves what our
problems are and we’re going to
decide for ourselves how they

Q should be responded to. Get in

our way, obstruct us from doing
what we think is right and,
[though] we’re not going to start
breaking rules, there’s going to
be controversy. Work with us
and there will be a resolution.”
Ligons, a junior black studies
and economics major, said that
the campus’ black community

3“ has no input in the development

of university policy, even when
policies directly affect the black
community .

“We don’t have significant,
acceptable or even proportional
input into the decision-making
process about what [the black
community’s] problems are and
how they will be dealt with,” he
said.

Marta Efﬁnger, the candidate
for deputy chairperson, believes
that involvement by more of the
black student body is necessary

before the problems can be
solved.

“We have to come to a point
where we’re going to make
decisions for ourselves. [The
administration] can’t tell us what
is best for us. We need to get to
the point where the black students
are concerned enough, and I
believe they are, but they’re
content [with the way things are]
or just don't know how to get
involved in such a way where
they are being effective.”

Ligons and Effinger are the
only candidates for the positions
this year. Another applicant did
not meet the BAS’s requirements
for office, thus eliminating a need
for the election, which would
have been held today. Ligons
follows Terri Tinnen as
chairperson, and Effinger assumes
Li gons former role as deputy chair.

A so phomore majoring in black
studies and English writing,
Efﬁnger said that BAS needs to
return to the spirit of unity that it
once had with the black studies

said. “We are not just one black
student group here. We're not
just one faculty group here. All of
us are one and we cannot
separate. To become a
progressive unit we have to get
back to working together, using
the resources that black studies
has to our benefit and vice versa. ”

Both Ligons and Efﬁnger want
the BAS to become as inﬂuential
as the campus Jewish community,
citing the administation’s
treatment of the recent graduation
date controversy as an example
of the power which the smaller
group holds.

“It’s ironic to me to see how
when the Jewish students had a
problem with the graduation date
there was all sorts of attention
paid to it and the university, if
they could have changed that
date, probably would have,” he
said. “It’s because the Jewish
community, and they’re much
smaller on campus than the black
community, was able to fully
exercise their power and

inﬂuence on the campus.”

Ligons said that the Jewish
community went to the
administration with their problem
and a solution and told them that
a change needed to be made.
Unlike the Jewish community,
the black community tends to go
to the administration for solutions
to their problems rather than
coming up with their own, he
said.

In addition to the general
problem of gaining a stronger
voice for the BAS, both candidates
are concerned with making Pitt
a “nourishing” environment for
the black student.

“If we make the university
nourishing in all of it’s aspects,
social as well as educational
because [a] social life contributes
to your ability to learn, then in
effect all our problems will be
dealt with on a different level.
Students will do better. They will
join [student] organizations and
will live their college experience

to the fullest,” said Ligons.
Ligons blames Pitt's lack of a
“nourishing” environment,

particularly an almost complete

non—existence of an on-campus
black social life, for the high
percentage of black students who
do not complete their educations
here within five years.

“It hurts the [whole] community
when you have a group of
students coming in [to Pitt] and
two years down the line they say
‘the university is teaching me some
stuff, but I need the ability to
socialize and experience,”’ said
Ligons. “College is not just books
and if you don’t provide [a social
outlet] then [those students] leave.”

Effinger is also concerned with
thehigh rate of blacks either
dropping out or transferring from

Pitt, but does not blame any one
aspect of campus life for the
problem.

“We need to study [the non-
completion rate] and see if it’s
because of economic reasons,
because of academic reasons,
because of a lack of support, or
[the students’ own responsibility.l
You have to study that and find
solutions because it can’t
continue,” she said.

Other issues concerning the
candidates include getting more
black faculty at Pitt, more
recruiting of black students, the
removal of Coca-Cola from the
cafeterias because of Coke’s
economic involvement in South
Africa and the growth of existing
black interest programs.

In addressing these issues
Ligons said that the BAS will

continue to follow correct
procedure, starting in their
steering committee and then going
to either Dennis Donham, the
interim vice president for student
affairs, or Assistant Provost Jack
Daniel.

“But when we get to the highest 2

ranks, say we get to {President}
Posvar and Posvar says no, but
he’s talking about [a serious issue
like] the future of the University
Challenge for Excellence Program
or the Afro- American section [of
Hillman library ], his veto is more
detrimental to my future and the
future of African- American
students here than if I take the
university and drag its name
through the newspapers and the
school to get what I need,” he
said.

Grad date indifference not O.K. with some

Mark Staf,
You're right, Pitt isn’t prejudiced
 but you are.

Charles A. Dinovitz
CGS ’90

Editor,

We are writing to express our
outrage at Mark Stafs editorial of
March 15th [“Change in School

.Graduation...”]. First, Mr. Stafs

argument that Christians are not
offended by Sunday graduations
is both disanalogous and ethno-
centric. Christian Sabbath worship
does not prohibit Christians from
operating automobiles, carrying
money, etc., as Orthodox Jewish
practice does. Such prohibitions
make attendance at Saturday com-
mencement impossible. Further-
more, traditional Jews are sup-
posed to devote the Sabbath day
exclusively to prayer, and would
thus violate Jewish religious law
by attending commencement ex-
ercises.

V Mr. Staf's assertion that the
Sabbath is “not a major Jewish
holiday” further reﬂects his igno-
rance. To Jews, observance of the
Sabbath is paramount; “bending
the rules’’ is clearly ‘inexcusable,

 "even if ‘it’ ‘is done for the conven-

ience of the Christian community.
Moreover, Mr. Stafs comparison
of the Jewish Sabbath to his 21st
birthday is irrelevant, ridiculous
and arrogant.

We write as religiously liberal
Jews who do not follow Orthodox
Sabbath practices. Yet we empa-
thize with those Jews at Pitt who
do. We do not perceive the ad-
rninistration’s actions as intention-

ally anti-Semitic (despite Mr. Stafs
suggestion thatJews consider Presi-
dent Posvar to be a Nazi). Instead,
we believe that university ofﬁcials
simply failed to recognize that a
Saturday commencement would
pose a problem for devoutjews. It
is this lack of understanding which
prevents better Christian-Jewish
relations in our society. As long as
such insensitivity is permitted to
dwell in the minds of otherwise
well-intentioned people, bigotry

Letters

will remain an unconquerable foe.
What next, Mr. Staf? An article
about “hook-nosed usurers”?

Alan Rosenthal

This is in response to Mark Stafs
article, “Change in School Gradu-
ation Date is Okay with Me.” De-
spite his apparent acquiescence
with the graduation date, .not eve-
rybody else in « the university is
quite satisﬁed with it. I have never
before read such an insulting, irre-
sponsible piece of journalism with
such weak arguments in The Pitt
News. Mark Staf ridiculed and be-
littled a holiday of great impor-
tance to many Jews; the Sabbath.
Perhaps God would be upset if a
Jewish student broke the laws of
his religion that have been ob-
served for thousands of years, to

attend a Pitt commencement. This
is not really for Mr. Staf to so
sarcastically determine. The com-
ment about the lack of a swastika in
Wesley Posvar’s office was ex-
tremely distasteful and uncalled for.
It seems to border on anti-Semi-
tism... Comparing the Sabbath to a
21st birthday and determining the
religious observances of the Jewish
Sabbath to be equal to a booze
binge is a very insulting ridicule.
No one accused the university of
being fascists, Nazis or anti-Sem-
ites. The graduation date should be
changed to a weekday to avoid
infringing upon any Sabbath of
any religion. Perhaps when Mr.
Staf attempts to write a decent piece
of journalism, he should refrain
from allowing his prejudices to so
blatantly be revealed. And, another
word of advice: it is unwise to insult
another’s religion, especially if you
have no idea as to what you're talk-

ing about.

Stephanie Meyer
CA8 '92

Dear Mr. Staf,

This is regarding your article
“Change in School Graduation Date
is OK with Me.” Who the hell asked
you anyway? What really troubles
me about the article is not your
opinion on‘ the subject, but the
tasteless and unsympathetic nature
of your reasoning. “Would God be
that upset if a Jewish student bent
the rules just once?” is not only a
statement of ignorance on your
behalf but an indication of the
sheer neolithic incompetence and
irresponsibility of the so-called Pitt
News staff. How you then made an
analogy of this event with liquor
consumption on your 21st birthday

was totally illogical as well as of-
fensive. Mr. Staf, I realize that lack
of knowledge is not a crime, but as
we have recently seen with Andy
Rooney and others like him, in-
sensitivity and prejudice is. What
really bothers me is that my tuition
will continue to support your
nonsense in the future,  or will it? ~

Gays not normal

Dear Editor,

I would like to respond to all of
the Gay-Rights nonsense that is
infiltrating our campus.

As a normal person (i..e. hetero-
sexual), I would like to present my
feelings on all of these Gay-Rights
organizations.

There cannot be discrimination
against gays, because tl1ey’re
wrong. If someone says 2+2=5
and you say they're wrong, are
you discriminating against them?
No, you are merely pointing our
their (sic) mistake.

Gays are like children who have
strayed from the path of normalcy.
Like children, they must be guided
back onto the right track.

The No. 1 reason for sex is for
procreation. Well, two guys can't
populate theearth. I’m not a type
of person who goes out looking to
condemn homosexuals, but I also
think that they are looking for too
many benefits. I don't go march-
ing down the streets of Washing-
ton D.C. saying I'm a heterosex-
ual. And you won’t find me trying
to get into GALA.

There is more to Greeks than meets the eye

With the continuous increase
ahd expansion of _Pitt’s_ Greek
‘ system, it is necessary to give more
speciﬁc attention to Pitt’s Greek
life. There are a lot of issues that I
have experienced through Greek
life that I feel could be interesting
not only for Greeks but non-Greeks
as well.
Within the Greek system, there

are a lot of things going on that.
— most of us do not know about. Just

to give a few examples: working
out rules for Greek Week events,
registering of fraternity parties with
the Inter-Fraternity Council or
welcoming new chapters into Pitt’s
Greek system.

Pitt’s Greek system, continuously
growing in size, has welcomed
two new chapters into the school
this year. Both Sigma Phi Epsilon
and Sigma Sigma Sigma have re-
colonized. Indeed, this takes a lot
of effort and dedication. Working

‘ directly with nationals, these new

chapters colonized, received help
with rush recruitment and were
received well by all of the current

Sandra
Kramer

chapters functioning here. Tri-
Sigma, now up to 51 members,
and Sigma Phi Epsilon, now up to
40 members, can be seen through-
out the campus displaying their
letters.

But have you noticed the blue-
and-orange Kappa Delta Rho jack-
ets around campus? This fraternal
organization is not currently rec-
ognized as a part of Pitt’s Greek
system. Regardless of the fact that
it is a national fraternity and its

members are wearing jackets that
say Kappa Delta Rho Pitt, it has not
colonized here. Having never gone
through the logistics involved with
colonization with both its nation-
als and Pitt’s IFC and Panhellenic
Association, it is not currently
considered a member of our Greek
system.

Even if Kappa Delta Rho consid-
ers itself an established fraternity
here, its members are missing out
on the true experiences of being a
Pitt Greek. Not only are they
unable to have mixers with other
fraternities and sororities or in-
clude themselves in formal rush
procedures to increase their mem-
bership, but they cannot even
participate in Greek Week. To
me, this is an event that should not
be missed by any Greek because
of its rewarding experiences in-
volving unity through both charity
and social functions.

Pitt’s Greeks are united and
support each other within their
chapters as well as system-wide
efforts. The unity between Pitt’s
Greeks rests in the strong interac-
tion with the IFC and Panhel or-
ganizations. Being a Pitt Greek is
a lot more than a grouping of
members wearing letters. It is,
indeed, a full experience that can-
not be achieved without the sup-
port of existing chapters. Without
colonizing and registering with the
IFC, Kappa Delta Rho will not
receive the support of Pitt’s estab-
lished chapters. Examples like Tri-
Sigma and Sigma Phi Epsilon show
how overall support from Pitt’s
Greeks can lead to a successful
chapter experience.

MONDAY, MARH 19,1990

 

Is it truely a time for political celebration?

The world seems to be becoming
a more peaceful place. Germany is
reunifying. Eastern Europe is break-
ing away from communism. Why,
there. haven't even been any major
soccer riots in, what, two months?

Even the Soviet Disjointed Union

is breaking up. Lithuania has de-
clared its independence. Soviet
Moldavia wants to rejoin Romania
(kind of like jumping from the
frying pan into a gas flame). Most of
the other republics either want free
elections or independence. The
Communist General Secretary has
been given more power 

 Wait a minute. Why is every-
body celebrating this? Mikhail
Gorbachev, whom the entire world
seems to be hailing as a shoo-in for
the next Nobel Peace Prize, has just
passed through the Soviet Con-
gress a bill that would give him
much more power.

That's right. The most popular
leader of the USSR since Peter the
Great has just given himselfa power
boost. Among other things, it al-

lows him to veto legislation that he
doesn’t particularly care for. He
will even be able to make a decla-
ration of war without consent from
anyone. Even President Bush, the

Jeff
Tatusko

leader of the free world, can’t do
that.

Gorbachev has turned the Polit-
buro into a presidential cabinet
The defense minister will become
simply another general. The head
of the KGB will be nothing more
than a grumpy, paranoid police
officer. All of this while their fear-
less leader makes his country more
“democratic.”

He has also pushed out one-
party rule in favor of multi-party
leadership. Simply put, even,
though he’s popular now, he’s not
going to be around forever. Who's
to say that the person who follows
him won't be some dernigod,

preaching peace but instead mobi-
lizing troops behind everybody’s
back?

Putting this much power into the
hands of one person is not democ-
racy; it's a dictatorship waiting to
happen. True democracy means
letting many people help make
decisions.

But hey, what do we have to
worry about? Gorbachev, in his
brand-new oath of office, prom-
ised that he would not become a
dictator. Gee, that really makes me
feel secure, almost as much as Abu
Nidal walking down a city street
with an automatic riﬂe, saying he
won't use it. The effect is about the
same, only on a much larger scale.

It’s scary to think of the possibili-
ties that this could bring about.
What would have happened ifjosef
Stalin would have legally had these
powers? We would have been ﬁght-

ing a new enemy rather early, and

World War II would have dragged
on for many more years. Or maybe
if Nikita Khrushchev woke up one

morning feeling rather grumpy,
the Cuban Missile Crisis could
have become much worse than it
actually was.

Things really are the same as
they always were over there. Yes,
Gorbachev was elected in a multi-
party election. Of course, due to
some “difficulties” faced by other
candidates, he was the only name
on the ballot. Sounds familiar,
doesn’t it?

In his best-selling novel Red
Storm Rising, author Tom Clancy
describes a Soviet plan to invade
the West by using maskirova, or
trickery. They make motions for
peace while preparing for war.
Now, I'm not saying that there is
an impending Soviet invasion
because of a movement for

Family man — from Reagan to baseballs

I've always felt that the best way
to judge a rnan’s life is to analyze
and consider not his achievements
or accomplishments, but the type
of father that he was. If good ol’
honest Abe Lincolnrwas a bad fa-
ther, then he’s no hero of mine.

I've always figured that I would
be good father someday. I would
teach my son the rights and wrongs.
I would teach him the virtues and
values of life. I would teach him
how to ﬁght to win and to lose
gracefully in defeat. I would read
the Declaration of Independence
to him at the age of three, Winston
Churchill's Iron Curtain speech at
the age of five, Ronald Reagan's
Evil Empire speech at the age of
seven, and by the time he was 10
years old, he would have read
everything ever written by Locke,
Madison and Jefferson. My son
would be an outstanding student so
he could succeed (i.e., make big
bucks) in the real world, and...

Stop. The last few months have
changed my whole outlook on how
to be the model father. Before my

son can crawl, he’s gonna know
how to throw a baseball (with his
left hand -— southpaw pitchers are
making fortunes nowadays). Be-
fore he can stand, he’s gonna
know how to hit a baseball. And.
before he can walk, he’s gonna
know how to field a groundball. If
I catch my son with his nose in any
book besides the baseball ency-
clopedia, then he’s gonna get a
Louisville Slugger plastered across
his butt.

You see, I haven't lost any de-
sire to see my son become a great
success; it's just that the means to
achieve the ends are totally differ-
ent today. After watching 10 ma-
jor-league baseball players sign $3
million plus contracts for the 1990
season — and too many medi-
ocre-at-best players reap million-
dollar salaries, and then go on
strike — I think it's time that any
caring, good-intentioned father get
his priorities straight. Why should
your kid laboriously study hour
after hour when he could have a
lot fun playing baseball and maybe

get a job as a pro ballplayer where
he earns 30 times more annually
than the Jones’ boy who graduated
from Harvard law school? The wise
father teaclfes his son to be a pro
ballplayer, not a doctor. -

  Paul
Kengor

Imagine the glamorous and ac-
tion-packed life that your son could
enjoy as a professional baseball
player. Pro ballplayers only “work”
seven months of each year. Their
“job” isn't even a nine-to-fiver. They
play a fun and thrilling game daily
in front of thousands of cheering
fans (or ‘should they be renamed
“customers”) who idolize them.
Then after playing a game on na-
tional television in front of a million
more admiring fans, they take a
shower, go to big-city nightclubs
with their teammates, most likely
drink free beers on the house, sign
autographs, take their pick of the
dozens of beautiful women hang-

ing all over them, party all night,
get to sleep before dawn, wake
up at 3:00 the next afternoon, go
to the next game and repeat the
whole process all over again. And
if the player wants,more money
then he can go on strike. Geesh!
What a tough life! I sympathize
with the ones that aren't making’
$3 million a year.

For pro ballplayers to even con-
sider_ arguing over arbitration
when they’re making millions is
ridiculous. (I realize there's more
to the current strike, but I still
don't care -— pro-baseball players
have got to be the greediest people
on the planet) In fact, the whole
mess has become so utterly re-
pulsive that 1, Paul Kengor, have
decided to adopt one of the most
idiotic and ineffective means of
protest; the boycott. Yes, _that’s
right, I'm "boycotting America's
national pastime. Call me a hypo-
crite if you'd like for succumbing

to this wretched left-wing tactic,

but I've had enough. I'm not
going to carry any signs, grow my
hair, pierce my ear or refuse to
bathe or eat until all pro ballplay-
ers take a rnillion-dollar salary
cut. I merely refuse to contribute
any more of my money to the
terminally greedy.

Neither can I cheer for Andy
Van Slyke to win another Gold
Glove or for Barry “Cry Baby”
Bonds to hit 30 home runs when
I know that if they do so, they’ll
be on the first plane out of Pitts-
burgh at the end of the season —
likely headed for Yankee, Inc. or
California. It would be morally
wrong to applaud such athletes.

Oh, believe me, I'll still teach
my son how to play ball so he can
become a big financial success.
But personally, I'm not watching
or paying for any more baseball.

By the way, just out of curiosity,
do any of you readers know where
I can pick up season tickets for
the Pirates — real cheap?

Bulls may be headed for
post-season play in MILL

By Geoff Moskowitz
Staff writer

The Pittsburgh Bulls split their last two games of the season to stay

V in a dog ﬁght for the Major Indoor Lacrosse League’s final playoff I

spot. They finished the regular season with a 3-5 record.

If the New York Saints and Baltimore Thunder also finish with 3-
5 records, the Bulls will play the New England Blazers in the MILL’s
three team playoff.

The currently undefeated Philadelphia Wings (6-0) have already
earned the right to try and repeat for their World Champion title.

The Bulls chances depend on two games next weekend. If the
Wings beat the Saints (2-4) and the Detroit Turbos upset the Baltimore
Thunder (3-4), the Bulls will ﬁnish third in the league based on goal
differential.

The Bulls knocked off the last place Turbos (16) Saturday night at
the Civic Arena, literally. Despite an early two goal lead by the
Turbos, the Bulls checked and fought their way to a 9-7 victory.

Head coach Dennis Wey said he thinks the Bull’s playoff chances
are very good.

“I told the guys at half time we’ve got to play this thing like we’re
playing for a playoff spot,” said Wey. “Let’s not be sitting at home
saying if, if, if,” he added.

Wey said he likes the two match—ups next weekend. Baltimore has
lost four games in a row and Philadelphia has not yet faltered, despite

Continued from page 10
a superior pressing defense and a
deep bench to pave their way to‘
the Sweet 16.

First-round‘ losers Providence
(Ohio State, 84-83) and Villanova
(Louisiana State, 70-63) say
goodbye to seniors Carlton Screen
and Marty Conlon, and Tom Greis

and Rodney Taylor, respectively. .

Conlon and Screen were part of
Rick Pitino’s Final Four team in
1987, while Greis and Taylor
helped Villanova’ to the Final Eight
last season.

Behind spark-plug guard Boo
Harvey, the St. John’s Redmen
advanced to their eighth NCAA
Tournament in the past nine years.
After an impressive opening-
round victory over Temple, the
Redmen faced Duke in the second
round in Atlanta. After
squandering a nine-point lead
and falling behind by nine, the
Blue Devils rallied behind Robert
Brickey to eliminate the Redmen
76-72 and advance to the East
Regional in East Rutherford next
weekend. The Redmen lose
Harvey and forward Jayson
Williams, two of this year's
mainstays, but return a
competitive squad led by Malik
Sealy, Robert Werdann, Billy
Singleton and Jason Buchanan.

Derrick Coleman of Syracuse

established a new NCAA modern-
day rebounding mark against
Coppin State, having amassed
1,516 boards in his career. He
surpasses Virginia All-American
Ralph Sampson as the modern
leader. Coleman also made his
way into the Syracuse record
books with 2,109 points, 1,516
rebounds, both all-time marks,
and 701 rebounds in the Big East,
moving ahead of Georgetown’s
second-place Patrick Ewing in
that category. The scary thing is
he will see at least one more day
of action following yesterday’s
game against, ironically enough,
Virginia.

The Orangemen outpaced
Coppin State 70-52 on Friday and
beat UVA on Sunday.

After eliminating Texas Souther
on Friday, Georgetown found
itself paired up with Xavier, a
winner over Kansas State in the
first round. While Georgetown
throws twin towers Dikembe

Mutombo and Alonzo Mourning .

at opponents, the Musketeers
have an inside duo of their own
in Tyrone Hill and Derek Strong,
both 6-foot-10. And Xavier will
play next weekend. Pete Gi1len’s
squad went up by nearly 20 points
and held on to defeat the Hoyas
74-71, thereby ending the careers
of Mark T illmon and Dwayne
Bryant, Georgetown’s senior
guards.

Upset City, Baby—— Northern
Io-who? Missouri, the three-seed
in the Southeast and one of the
top—ranked teams in the nation,
might have asked that same
question before Friday's contest,
but a Northern Iowa three-pointer
at the buzzer for a 74-71 win
dropped the Wildcats out of the
field of 64. And this was a team
that was expected to challenge
for the national title.

With or without Coach Rick

Majerus, Ball State is for real. The

portly coach led BSU to as first-
round victory over the Pitt
Panthers last year but opted for
the coaching position at Utah
after the season. The players
remained, however, and while
their win-loss record is not quite
as impressive under Dick
Hunsaker as last season, they’ve
used their tournament experience
to their advantage, defeating Gary
Payton-led Oregon State and
Louisville en route to the Sweet
16. ' A

Although bowing out of the
tourney Saturday against
Arkansas, the Dayton Flyers gave
the tournament members
something to think about by
knocking off Illinois, a Final Four
team last year. It was the ﬁnal
collegiate game for Kendall Gill,
the do—it-all guard whose
presence nearly lifted the Illini
into the championship game in
1989.

It seemed that only Georgetown
stood in the way of Oklahoma
advancing to the Final Four out
of the Midwest Region. North

- Carolina Coach Dean Smith saw

it differently, however, and his
eight-seeded Tarheels made one
more layup than the Sooners,
winning 79-77 to advance to their
10th consecutive round of 16.
Pittsburgh’s own Robert Morris
took 1988 national champion
Kansas to task Friday, falling
behind by one at the half and
eventually losing 79—7l. Quite a
turnaround from 1989, when
Arizona defeated the Colonials
94-60. The television exposure
and, above all, the performance
that Coach Jarrett Durham and
his squad gave will make RMC

more than just the third basketball '

team in Pittsburgh, especially
since the other two —— Pitt and
Duquesne —— did not make the
NCAAs, or the NIT, for that matter.

That Clean Mountain Air --
With Louisville's elimination in
the West and Oklahoma’s
departure in the Midwest, UNLV
appears to have the clearest path
to the Final Four. UNLV plays
Ball State and then the winner of
the LMU—Arizona/Alabama game.

Xavier will take on Texas, a one-
point winner over Purdue, and
Arkansas plays North Carolina in
the Midwest, perhaps the most
up-for-grabs Regional. The East
might produce the best games
next weekend as UConn takes on
Clemson, and Duke, a Final Four
participant in three of the past
four years, plays UCLA, an upset
winner over
Kansas. In the Southeast,
Michigan State and Georgia Tech
match up next weekend for a trip
to the Final Eight, as do Syracuse
and Minnesota.

Emotions in Motion —
Those who never saw Hank
Gathers play watched as his
teammates played for him against
New Mexico State Friday night.
Loyola-Marymount dedicated this
tournament to Gathers, who died
after collapsing on the court March
4. His best friend, senior Bo
Kimble, was particularly
impassioned in the game,
collecting four personal fouls in
the ﬁrst 15 minutes of the game
and allowing the Aggies to remain

second-seeded 7

competitive. But the second half 9 7 I

changed all that. Kimble played

on the brink of expulsion for all I

but :38 of that period, collecting

33 of his 45 points to go with 18.

rebounds to lead LMU to a 1 1 1-92

win. Against defending ‘national I

champion Michigan, Marymount
quickened the pace, winning 149-
115 to break the tourney scoring
record by more than 20 points.
The Well, Maybe Award -

To CBS, which chose to televise
the Xavier-Georgetown game
rather than LMU-Michigan. While
Xavier’s upset victory was a better
game, the Loyola game cried out
to be televised. Gathers’ death
has _drawn attention to this
program, which is performing
like a contender, not a marauder.
And surely it would have attracted
a larger audience than GT/Xavier,
as" most people expected a
Georgetown win. Still,
probably didn't lose any respect
by making the wrong choice.

Playoﬁ picture becoming clear czsNH1; season goes down to the wire

As the National Hockey League
writes the ﬁnal chapter of its
regular season, all the Penguins
can hope for is a fairy-tale ending.

Without Mario Lemieux, Torn
Barrasso and Zarley Zalapski, the
Penguins have as much of a
chance to make the playoffs and
be competitive as major-league
baseball does of starting on time:

Next to nothing.

‘ At one time, this season looked
as if it would be the most
prosperous in franchise history.
The question wasn’t whether the
Pens would make the playoffs; it
was by how many points they
would win the Patrick Division.

One problem. The season
hadn't started.

Once it did, all hell broke loose.

were ﬁred.

Enter new GM/Interim Coach
Craig Patrick.‘ He was going to
install a defensive game plan so
the Penguins didn’t have a
Chinese ﬁre drill every time an
opponent brought a puck into
the defensive zone.

It sounded good and was
working well until the offense

and defense lost their No. 1

contributors. Barrasso, the key to
the defense, had to leave to be
with his cancer—strickened
daughter. Lemieux had to leave
because his back wouldn’t let
him walk.

Believe it or not, there is hope.
Don’t forget the Pens are members
of the weak sister in the NHL,
better known as the Patrick
Division. The Penguins are also
very happy that the top four
teams in each division make the
playoffs.

Even with all their problems,
the Penguins had a chance to win
the division until last week when
the New York Rangers went on a
winning streak and acquired Mike

Gartner to go along with their
offensive star Bernie Nichols.
The New Jersey Devils also
seem to be putting it together
now that they have solved some
of their internal disputes. They

Ron
Ledgard

added some veteran leadership
and scoring touch with the
acquisition of Peter Stastny.
The New York Islanders have
stood pat since their early season
acquisitions of role players. Their
major pluses down the stretch
are MVP candidate Pat Lafontaine
and head coach Al Arbour. Arbour
was the mastermind behind the
four Islanders’ Stanley Cup
championships and this season
has proved he knows how to
coach a very young team.

The Washington Capitals have
tried the Murray family for help
this season. They started with
nine-year incumbent Brian
Murray as head coach; then once
things didn’t look promising, they
fired him and hired his brother
Terry. They hoped he would do
something bro couldn’t do— get
past the first round. The Capitals
seem to have forgotten one thing:
They have to be invited to the 16-
team party before they can get
past the first round. ‘The
acquisition of the league’s
second-highest-rated goalie,
Mike Liut from Hartford, could
place the Caps on the invitation
list.

The Philadelphia Flyers might
do something this season they

, haven’t done the past 18 ——- not

make the playoffs. Injuries and
age have brought the Flyers down
to earth this season. They have
already started the rebuilding
process by trading away Brian
Propp and Dave Poulin. The one
thing they do have is the easiest
schedule down the stretch. (See

"Notes.")

The Penguins have had more
problems than the others, but
there are answers that could show
up if they squeak in the back
doon

Lemieux could be back for the
first round of the play offs,
Zalapski is due back the last
week of the season, and Barrasso
might be back with the team for
Thursday's game against the
Flyers.

None of them will be in playing
shape, especially Barrasso. He
wasn’t in shape the last time he
came back. That is where Alain
Chevrier, the newest goalie, is
going to have to step in. Last
season, he alrnostsingle-handedly
carried the Chicago Blackhawks
to the Stanley Cup Finals. He fell
on hard times early this season
with the Blackhawks, but does
have the ability to get very hot.
Two years ago, he was a member
of the Newjersey Devil team that
went to the Wales Conference
Final.

two tough overtime victories this
season.

One of those was over the
Bulls March 3. “We shou1d’ve
gotten by Philly two weeks ago,"
said Wey. “But we're getting
better each game."

The Wings ﬂushed the Bulls 9-
8 in their second meeting. ‘We
have to keep our goaltender in
the cage. A few mental errors
hurt us in that game by not
picking people up,” said Wey.
Not only did the Bulls lose with
just 48 seconds left in overtime,
but goalie Jim Beardmore
accounted for three of the Wings
goals by wandering too far away
from the crease. “It’s just a mental
breakdown,” added Wey.

The Wings capitalized on
power play opportunities and
effectively shut down Brian
Nikula, the MILL’s leading scorer.
Wings forward Andy Wilson was
in the right place at the right time
all night, and earned the MVP
with a hat—trick performance.
Butch Marino had a notable night
for the Bulls.

Nikula and the Bulls bounced
back strong against the Turbos.
Nikula led the Bulls with four
goals, and won the game MVP.

“It was fun tonight, a real good
time," said Nikula. “It's very
ﬂattering winning the MVP, it’s
nice, but we had a lot of guys
tonight who played very well. If
they didn't base it solely on who
got goals, Dave Pietramala could
have been the MVP."

Pietramala scored once and
added a couple of assists,
including a beautiful rush up the
boards past two Turbo defenders
to find Brenden Kelley who made
a ﬂying shot to put the Bulls up 7-

Nikula scored his 20th goal of
the season seconds later to ice
the game for the Bulls. The Turbos
were able to score once more
before Wayne Gebelein scored
his first goal of the season with
one second left in the game for
the Bulls third victory.

Bulls goalie Jim Beardmore
played much closer to home
against Detroit and was able to
hold off their strong attack.
Beardmore said a minor knee
injury accounted for his lack of
mobility.

“It was actually good because .
it kept me in the goal making
saves, and that's my job,” said
Beardmore.

Volleyball club beats PSU-Behrend

By John Labriola
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's volleyball club
shut out the Cubs of Penn State
University-Behrend on Sunday
at Trees Hall, 3~0.

The Pitt squad was surprised
by the level of the Cubs’ play.
“Penn State didn't play as well as
we had expected them to play
this weekend. They’re usually a
much stronger team,” said Greg
Lockley, a senior outside hitter
for the Panthers.

“We expected them to come
out with more power and really
a lot more [aggressiveness]. They
played well but not as well as we
had expected them to play.”

The Panthers were trailing the
Cubs 8-2 during first game, but
eventually won 15-11.

Steve Kitay, another senior
outside hitter for the Panthers,
said that his team experienced
some difficulty in the beginning

of the match.

“We were struggling at first,”
said Kitay. “We had trouble
getting our hits in, but once we
adjusted our defense to theirs,
things went smooth.”

The Panthers won the second
match 15-13.

“I set pretty good, and
whenever I got set, I hit the ball
pretty well, ” said Luke Rubosky,
junior setter for the Panthers.
“Penn State -— it seemed like
their big guns weren’t hitting
the ball well today or we were
blocking them or something.
They’re usually 'really good.
They dug pretty much
everything hit, and they had a
real good block; it’s just that
their passing I think wasn't very
good today,” Rubosky added.

The Panthers dominated the
third game of the match and
crushed PSU 15-7. Senior back-
row specialist John Szafranski
spent the majority of the game

sliding on the ﬂoor to make
incredible saves for Pitt.
Szafranski said he felt that the
Panthers worked together and
that overall, everyone’s
performance was excellent.

. “I think our front row shut
them down, plus our defense,
when we got a couple of their
hits, we dug them out They
kind of went a little ﬂat. We
took it to them and shut them
down,” added Szafranski.

Panther ‘Coach Steve
Hoffman had to control his
excitement for his team,
because he and three other
Pitt players were ﬁlling in for
the four missing referees and
line judges.

“In general, for the last three
matches, our defense has been
phenomenal,” said Hoffman.
“Our offense today was good.
Depending upon the
competition, it’s just
phenomenally strong as well."

Continued from page 12

Each of Chevrier’s previous
teams had to win its ﬁnal game of
the regular season to make the
playoffs, and we saw the
problems they caused once they
got in. Maybe some of his luck
can wear off on this very unlucky
franchise. ,

In the case of Lemieux, all he
did when his back started to
really bother him was to score in

A 46 straight games. In a game

against the New York Islanders
during the streak, Lemieux was
unable to stand erect. Once on
the ice, he scored five points that
carried the Pens to victory. We
know he can play with some
pain and still contribute like no
one else in this league.

Even though he says he won't

is 100 percent, watch out for the
franchise to ride his white horse
into town if this team somehow
makes the playoffs.

Patrick Division Notes:

The Penguins went 0-1-1 this
weekend. Saturday, they lost a
tough one at home against the
Minnesota Northstars, 6-2, with
Chevrier in goal. That made his
record 1-2-0 in a Penguins
uniform. Yesterday, the Pens
managed a tie on Long Island.
Paul Coffey scored in the second
period to make the score 2-2, and
Wendell Youn held fast in net as
the inspired Islanders tried to go
for two in a row.

Saturday the Isles defeated the
Rangers 6-3 to end their 14-game
winless streak. The Capitals lost a
