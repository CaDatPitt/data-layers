  Cannabis bill a blunt     

look at legalization

The politics of marijuana are
in many ways still stuck in the last

generation, with starry—eye‘d free- I

love types advocating personal
freedom and responsibility while
the hard—no_sed federal govern-
ment testifies against a culture .of
“Reefer Madness”-style addiction
and depravity.

. Even while much of the
medical community, including the
American Medical Association and
American Psychiatric Association,
has endorsed the use of medical
cannabis, recreational use remains
strictly prohibited under federal
law andwith few vocal proponents
other than the National Organiza-

' tion for the Reform of 
Laws and High Times magazine.

But California Assembly Bill 390 is _

attempting to change all that.

The bill, also known as the
Marijuana ‘ Control, Regulation
and Education Act, would be a
huge step for the full legalization
of cannabis in the United States.
It would fully legalize the grow-
ing, distribution and consumption
of marijuana for recreational pur-
poses in California. For practical
purposes, California would treat
the substance almost identically to
alcoholic beverages.

There’s an economic side, as

0 well. Tom Ammiano, who spon-

sored the bill, estimates that with a
$50 tax on every ounce of marijua-
na grown and sold, the law would
bring in more than $1.2 billion an-
nually to California’s economy, a
signiﬁcant ﬁgure given.the state’s
recent budget woes. '

‘ - People who want to grow

- _matijuana commercially would

pay a $1§5,000‘license fee, and up to
$2,500 per year after that to renew
the license. Any person over the
age of 21 could buy cannabis from

these licensed growers,

The major problem with this A
bill is that it would still be illegal :
to do any of the aforementioned E

things under federal law. Under 1

the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy
clause, federal law supersedes

any conﬂicting state or local law, ‘
meaning that federal agents could _
still make arrests for activities that _
were no longer illegal under _Cali— 

fornia law.

Bills like this also "raise ques- 3
tions about the regulation and 
‘commercialization of substances
like  Even though the 2

 Who is Worse, Bunningor Burris?

. Incontrast, the California bill is 
allowing anyone with $5,000 and a .
supply of seeds to start their own .

uct sold to consumers. To "put it .

Senators Roland Burris, D-Ill.,
and Tim Bunning, R—Ky.,' appear to
be in a heated race to see who can
get manhandled out of the Senate
first. I _

In terms of unethical behavior,
lack of party support and unadul-
terated craziness, both senators
have impressive resumes, and party
leaders of each have expressed an
interest in, shall we say, “reposi-
tioning” the congressmen.

' But as we all know, in politics
there can be only one champion.

So let’s take a look at where each

senator stands. .

-Party Support: You know it’s
bad when members of your own
party hate you so much that they
would suggest a special election that
could theoretically place a member
of theopposite-party in office. Yet

him just that much. According to
The New York Times, Gov. Patrick
Quinn, D-Ill., will give Burris only
two weeks to resign before urging
Illinois lawmakers to consider ‘a

V special election, a thought echoed

by the state’s attorney general, Lisa
Madigan. _ -

Bunning, on the other hand, has
threatened to sue the Republican

4 Party after Texas Sen. John Cornyn,

chair of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee — which
traditionally assists Republican
senatorial candidates — reported
that he didn’t know if Bunning was
running for re-election.
‘Apparently this outraged Bun-



In terms of unethical behav- .

ior, lack of party support and
unadulterated craziness,both
senators have impressive re-
sumes, and party leaders of each
have expressed an interest in,
shall we say, .'repositioning' the

congressmen  é
 

ning enough for this little slam
fest: “I don’t believe anythingjohn

Cornyn says  I’ve had rniscom-

ijmunications with john Cornyn

from, I guess, the first week of this
current session of the Senate. He
either doesn’t_ understand English
or he doesn’t understand direct,
‘I’m going to run.”’ Bunning went
on to tell the Louisville Courier-
Journal that he would sue Cornyn
and the Republican Senate com-
mittee if they backed a challenger

~a.«aii'?"=;;.«

MCI’ Campus

in a primary race against him next
year. ‘

\While it’s clear the Democrats
have no love for Burris, this ‘one
goes to Bunning, for creating prob-
lems where there weren’t really any
to begin with and successfully
alienating the most inﬂuential Re-
publican members of the Senate.

Ethical issues: It’s difﬁcult not
to, give this one to Burris, consid-
ering his pending perjury inves-
tigation — Burris neglected to
mention in former Illinois Gov.

Rod Blagojevich’s impeachment

_ heating that he had been asked by

Blagojevich’s brother to help raise
catnpaign funds. Mere association
with the name “Rod Blagojevich”
is enough to win this category.

Re-election efforts: Everyone A

knows that the majority of a poli-
tician’s time and effort is devoted
to re-‘election, so what better'way
-to judge a senator’s efficacy? Bur-
ris comes out swinging with a “re-
election” Web site that looks like
something I could have -made on
an Angelﬁre account. But under-
neath the site’s plain, ugly exterior
there is  well, a donation button.
Here’s what else the site has to
offer: Under accomplishments ——
a blank page. Under endorsements

ticles — a blank page. This was

There is a whole raft of prob-

not only theoretical. A major con- ‘

and other such measures might

It seems ironic that political lib-

erals, the very people who blamed

George W. Bush for destroying U.S.
relations -with the rest of the world,
are usually the people who argue for
protectionism. A rush to protect
causes a drying up of world trade,
and it substantially harms the cred-
ibility of the United States abroad.
We have committed to a series
of organizations and treaties that
are all about expanding free trade.

NAFTA, CAPTA and the WTO/

are obligations, not just a collection
of cool acronyms. Ditching them
sends the message that we might
abandon future agreements when
it is politically expedient to do so.
It also smacks of hypocrisy, as the
United States has led the charge for
free trade for over a generation and
repeatedly urged other countries to
open their markets to us. I

Tariffs against China in particu- '

lar might touch off a powder keg in
the Far East. Some 20 million mi-

grantworkers were laid off in Chi-
na, and there are signs that China’s
economic growth, based largely on
exports, is flagging. U.S. trade barri-
ers might push the Chinese econo-
my over the brink. s

This is problematic. The gov-
ernment has long let a booming
economy distract from the need
for political reform. The potential
for social unrest in China is vast.
If disobedience erupts, the Chi-
nese government might institute
even more repressive practices, or it
might focus so much. on maintain-
ing control over its own people that
it is unable to contain North Korea.
It is also possible the Communist
Party would sanction aggressive
action toward Taiwan as a way of
building national solidarity. ,

With any luck, the Obama ad-
ministration will ignore the consid-
erable pressureit likely faces in the
coming months. If not, We might
all end up as dazedand conﬁised as

“The World Goes ’Round”

A Pittsburgh Public Theater produc-
tion

O’Reilly Theater, Downtown

March 5 — April 5

412-316-1600 or www.ppt.org
Tickets also available through Pitt Arts

What do you get when you com-
bine roller skates, instruments and a
whole lot of singing and dancing?
“The World Goes ’Round,” the lat-
est show to hit Pittsburgh Public
Theater. '

The song and dance revue was
created in 1991 by famed Broadway
music and lync writers John Kander
and Fred Ebb. The Tony, Grammy
and Oscar—winning duo were in the
business for over 40 years, 
songs for hit shows like “Chicago”
and “Cabaret”

Conjured by director Scott Ellis,
choreographer Susan Stroman and
librettist David Thompson, "The

World Goes ’Round” pays tribute to ‘

the finest work of Kander and Ebb.
Audiences will be entertained with a
night of the funny, the foreign and

the familiar ir1 songs like “All That
jazz” and “New York, New York”

Margie Romero, the communica-
tions manager at Pittsburgh Public
Theater, explained why the show was
an easy choice for the theater and
cited Artistic Director Ted Pappas as
the  force behind bringing the
show to Pittsburgh —— Pappas saw
and liked it Tari Kelly, who returns
for this show, had appeared in “Cab-
aret” here and was a big success.

“W/orld Goes ’Round,” however,
is a little different than the typical
musical.

“It’s all singing and  no
book or storyline. One song flows
right into the next song. It’s nicely
put together. People will be amazed
at how many great songs there are
Even ones that were written years
ago are still timely,” laughed Rome-
ro, citing lyiics about losing all your
money.

Michael Rice, the show’s music
director, will play the piano. Five
other local musicians comprise the
live band, playing a wide spread of
instruments

Potential audience members
should open their minds to the
change of pace with “The World
Goes ’Round,” said Romero.

Wfith the  release of the ‘

comic book adaptation “\Watchmen”
and a nation of neck-bearded, blood-
thirsty bloggers and goons chomping

i at the bit to declare it simultaneously
‘ the best and worst movie of all time,

having an opinion is scary.

But before the batde lines are
drawn, we can enjoy a bit of solidarity
in that most sacred rite of geeky pas-
sage: the midnight 

It’s the true test of devotion — to
show that no, you won’t wait another
18 hours, and going to sleep even one
more time before ﬁnally seeing this

movie is too much to ask. You’re a kid

on Christmas Eve, and by God, you
are opening those presents the minute
the clock strikes 12. ’

Of course, there are obvious rea-
sons that the concept of the premiere
has detractors

Buying tickets days or weeksin
advance and spending the 
slumped on the ﬂoor of a movie
theater lobby is a major time com-
mitment — the auditorium usu-

ally doesn’t even open until around 11 .

pm, if you’re lucky. And in the case of
a ﬁlm like “Watchmen,”- which sports
a hefty  time of two hours and

Yet the two of us felt no shame

at the premiere of the last “Harry

marker “HP 4 Life” tattoos, we were
among the least decorated fans in a

theater full of wand-wiggling, would-

be wizards _ -

At no other screening of a movie
will you ﬁnd an audience as attentive as
the one that sat and waited outside the
theater for two hours, nor can you rec-
reate the camaraderie and excitement
that comes with sharing in that event;
It’s the reason people have ﬂocked to
theaters for over 30 years to see “The
Rpcky Horror Picture Show” — not
because it’s a good movie, but because
of the nature of a group experience,

‘For thisreason, I urge my fel-

dramatic and always delicate touch. The re-
suit is poignant both when the music is blar-
ing and when it dances in the background.

Where the album strays from any Stripes
comparison, though, is in subject matter;
Writing an ode to a fallen child star isn’t
exactly .everyday rock ’n’ roll fare, but Fer-
ree’s passionate touch makes for a heartfelt
attempt — the record could arguably turn
into a stage version of Bobby Dee’s sad life,
as the lyrics. and dramatics are all there.

The third track is another different spin,
using the catchy beats from the 1950s be-
hind the.chorus, “Nothing is wrong. / Ev-
erythingis ﬁne. / Business is good. / Busi-
ness is fine. ./ Business is so good.”

. Ferree’s talent sings with a necessary hint
of sarcasm that turns his lyrics into satire
material. He gets bonus points for incorpo-
rating the line, “Bring out the pixie dust,”

to think of any reference other than the in-
famous Peter Pan yet again.
The album takes a turn for the odd

i when “Iris Flewers” starts up. At only one

minute long, “Iris Flowers” is an insert, a
poem read by a little girl.

There are sirens in the distance as the
innocent voice recites, “All of the campfires
of the world were left by themselves. So the
world is still turning, and it burns like hell.”

As with many poems, its meaning is wide

open. .

- After the poem, the catchy and captivat-
ing music returns, so much so it seems _the
words are lost among the beats. It’s strong
music at least, especially once listeners hit
the love songs like “Whirlpool of Love.”
The album ends with a bluesy, folk bang, en

For a while in the first half
against St. ]0hn’s, it looked like
next year’s Pitt women’s basket-
ball team was playing. Seniors
and Xenia
Stewart didn’t score much com-
pared to their undergraduate col-
leagues, as Zellous put up six and
Stewart seven points in the ﬁrst

V half.

But on senior night at the
Petersen Events Center, Zellous
came back in the second half, as
she often does, and ended up lead-
ing the. Panthers with 18 points
and three rebounds. Her regular
season ended on a usual high note
as Pitt sent the Red Storm to its
12th loss in 15 games, 79-60.

“Our senior night and playing
for the University of Pittsburgh

has been truly a blessing,” said

Zellous after the game. “I just
have to thank my teammates. I

love them to death. They’re like
my sisters. I’m really going to

Pitt increases Win streak to four games

by Sergei Feldman
Staff Writer

The Pitt softball team entered
the Magic City Classic this weekend
riding a two-game  streak
at the Texas A&M Corpus Christi
tournament.

The team hoped to return home
with a six-game  streak,
but settled for four, as inclement
weather led to the cancellation of
the tournamenfs final two games
against the University of Alabama-
Birmingham and Michigan State.

Victories over Samford Univer-
sity and  State to start the
UAB Tournament improved Pitt’s
record to 6-6 on the year.

The Panthers’ next action comes
in the George \Washington Invi-
tational in \Washington with two
games against both the host school

and Army starting March 7. Then
they will travel to play Charlotte for
a doubleheader before moving to
Rock Hill, S.C. for the \X/inthrop In-
vitational to end spring-break play.
Pitt 7, Samford 1
A six-run, second-inning explo-
sion propelled Pitt to a 7-1 victory
over Samford University to start the
Magic City Classic
'Pitt’s back-to-back doubles re-
sulted in the game’s ﬁrst two runs.
Sophomore Alicia Broudy and
freshman Lauren Davis led the
 surge. Scoring the runs were
freshmen Sara Falotico and Keli
Gaynor.
Immediately following, sopho-
more Reba Tutt earned her team-
leading second triple of the sea-

son to knock in two runs, sending

Broudy and Davis home.

If that onslaught was not
enough, senior Samantha Card’s tri-
ple to right ﬁeld moments later sure-
ly was. A passed ball allowed Card to
score the ﬁnal run of the 

The 6-0 lead proved insur-
mountable.

Samford got on the board in the
ﬁfth  off a Pitt error, but the
three hits resulted in only the lone
run.
Pitt tallied the game’s ﬁnal run in
the sixth 

Sophomore Cory Berliner im-
proved to 2-3 on the year after
pitching the complete game, allow-
ing four hits and a run.

Pitt 5, Alabama State 

I The Magic City Classic’s second
battle for Pitt proved more difﬁcult
and called for resiliency, as Pitt ral-
lied from a 2-0 deﬁcit to defeat Ala-

bama State, 5-2.

A couple of errors by the Pan-
thers gave Alabama State its two
runsintheﬁrstandthirdinnings,
respectively.

The come-from-behind victory
started in the fourth  as three
hits knocked in two runs to tie the
game at 2-2. Card’s double to cen-
ter sent Tutt home to get Pitt on the
board. A two—out single by ﬂesh-
man Ciera Damon sent Card home
moments later. '

Davis’ sacriﬁce ground ball
proved to be the game-winner,
knocking in Gaynor’s go-ahead run.

Both Tutt and Card ﬁnished
2-for-4, leading Pitt to victory

Sophomore pitcher Alyssa
O’Connell gave up three hits and
struck out ﬁve, improving her re-

cord this season to 3-0.

The Littman Test. ‘

Turn to Tunes to ﬁx steroid problem

by Adam Littman
Senior Staﬂ Writer

1 , youre o

talk surrounding baseball.

 

It’s sickening, and really, the

thingto dois move on andrnake sure
nothing like it ever happens  Yet,
nobody can let it go. And it’s hard to
blame them, as something of this mag-
nitude has never happened before

Baseball wants to handle this per-
fectiysoscandalcanbeathingof the
past, just another era of the game Ex-
cept, baseball is  the book on
whattodoasitgoes along.Thereisno
blueprint, or at least not one that base-
ball seems willing to use

Over the weekend, I watched a
movie that had a similar problem "to
that of baseball and showed me the
perfectway to ﬁx Americas pastime. It
was such a simple yet perfect solution
to baseball’s problem, and 
the movie was made in 1996.

The movie is “Space Jam.’ ’

Yes, the Michael Jordan ‘vehicle
where he plays with the Looney Tunes
to help them escape  slaves
at an alien-run amusement park on an-
other planet

In the movie, the amusement park
on Moron Mountain is  and the
green boss guy needs attractions to
make money. He opts to bring in the
Looney Tunes’ The boss’s henchmen,

Aestjero 

I Tunes steal Michael

.ﬁve roughly squirrel—sized creatures

colored like a bag of Skitties, go to
Earth to capture the Tunes and bring

‘them to Moron Mountain Bugs Bun-

Cool]? The chorus‘ goes, “We want it
all. / Unstoppable,  run the ﬂoor: /
You can’t take none of this hardcore
/Inthegamewetakeyoutowai:/
You airft seen nothin’ like this before”
Then it brags about  people 
and low, which could be seen as in-
structions on where and how to

Not to mention, many of those

beat the aliens, now

It seems like a stretch, but
it's not the first time a sports
movie subtly gave us pointers ‘

on real—life issues.

enthusiasts — not
of steroids, but of
'  It prob-
ably wouldn’t help
athletes, but mari-
juana is a well-doc-

cleverly known as

It seems like a stretch, but it’s not
the ﬁrsttime a sports movie subdy gave
us pointers on real—life issues “Celtic
Pride” showedusthatsomefans think
theycanhelp theirtearnswinwithsilly
things like  position, when the
only way to actually assist in victory
is to  the opposing tearn’s star:
And “Rookie of the Year” showed
kids that if you aren’t talented enough
to suoceedinLittieLea.gue,breakyour
arm and skip ahead to the pros

Alas, this is about how “Space
Jam” is a film about steroids How.
about the song the Monstars come out
to, “Hit ‘Em High,” by B—Real, Busta
Rhymes, Coolio, Method Man and LL

Once you have the various trainers and
cousins of baseball’s ﬁnmt, pay them
extraordinary amounts of money to
make sure they don’t  anyone

with steroids Instead, make it a polio A

vaccine or ﬂu shot or something.

Thatway, the gameis actuallyclean,
but all the players think theyfre much
more  than they are It’s the
perfect tradeoff

If the Looney Tunes could over-""

come its hour—long steroid era in bas-
ketball games to determine if a group
of animated characters would end
up as slaves, why can’t baseball? All it
has to do is start  out some
needles

And if baseball isn’t  to legal-
ize steroids, the least it could do is shut
up and just move on.

Win. Zellous tallied 18 points and three rebounds in her ﬁnal «regular season ganie.

miss the University of Pittsburg .”

Prior to the game, Zellous and Stewart
were honored by coach Agnus Berenato,
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, their par-
ents and others with ﬂowers, framed jer-
seys, pictures and videos played before the
crowd. '

In their four years of play, the two
managed to lead the team. to four 20-win
seasons and the team’s first three NCAA
Tournament appearances. This season,
Zellous became the first basketball player
in Pitt history, man or woman, to score 600
or more points in three seasons.

Additionally, after the win, No. 14 Pitt
(22—6, 12-4 Big East) enters the Big East
tournament with its best—ever conference
winning percentage at .750. _

No one player dominated in scoring
against the Red Storm (16-l3, 4—l2) in the
ﬁrst "half. Freshman Shawnice “Pepper”
Wilson pulled down more rebounds than
anyone on either team, with seven in the
ﬁrst 20 minutes. . '

Wilson left the game early, playing only
25 minutes after committing four fouls,’ but
in those minutes she put up 12 points and
brought down 11 rebounds.

The Panthers led for the entire ﬁrst half,
with St. John’s coming  one midway
through the ha.l£ ‘ '

A Wilson started scoring for the Panthers

A and got the ﬁrst rebound off a missed St.

John’s shot. Junior Sophronia Sallard scored

next and got Pitt an early 4-0 lead.

‘St. John’s Sky Lindsay led her team
within reach of the lead at 12-11, but Sal-
lard and Zellous pushed the score to 18-15
before starting a 10-0 scoring run. During
the run, ﬁve different Panthers shared the
scoring.

After that, the Panthers held at least a
10-point advantage for the remainder of
the half, with Sallard and Wilson leading the
way. Sallard ended the game with 10 points,
eight of which came in the ﬁrst half.

The score was 43-30 with Pitt leading
at the half

The Panthers held their substantial lead
throughout the remainder of the game, go-
ing up by as many as 28 in the middle of
the second half. The seniors stayed in the
game for all but a few minutes and were
taken out with two minutes left to play.

Stewart ended ‘her home career scor-
ing 12 points and bringing down ﬁve ‘re-
bounds. _ ' '

“The important thing is that we played
as a family,” said Stewart. “[Zellous and 1]
are glad to be a part of [Pitt women’s bas-
ketball], but the story hasn’t ended yet. See
us in the Final Four.”

Pitt will travel to Hartford, Conn., as
the Big East tournament begins on Friday.
With a No. 3 seed, the team earned a ﬁrst-
and second-round bye, and will face either

the sixth, 11th or 14th seed in the Vquarter--

ﬁnals at 8 p.m. on Sunday.
