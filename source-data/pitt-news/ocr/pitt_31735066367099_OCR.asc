Faculty Questions Vietnam PoliCY

’Press Advertisement  
Signed by 78 Teacherst

By DAN BOOKER
Seventy-eight University fac-
ulty members have called for‘ a
change in the Johnson adminis-
tration’s policy in Vietnam. They

expressed their position in a re— s

cent advertisement in the Pitts-
burgh Press.

The advertisement, signed by,
faculty members of Pitt, Carne-
gie Institute of Technology, Du-
quesne University, and Chatham.
College “called upon the governs
merit to: .

> “Cease all bombing, North
and South, and all other offensive

military operations immediately;_

> “Indicate that it will negoti-
ate. with the National Liberation.
Front and all other interested
parties for a peaceful settlement;

‘> “Encourage in every way, and
in no way to interfere with, the
free exercise of popular sover-
eignty in Vietnam;

>“And evaluate seriously
whether self- determination for
the Vietnamese as well as our
own national interests would be
best served by termination of
our military presence in Viet-
nam.” . '

High Hopes Crushed

Frosh React To “Press” Error o

By BERNI McLFDD
When someone jumped the
- gun at the news bureaus last
week, prospective freshmen
.and University students

alike were undoubtedly re-V

lieved to hear tuition was
$450 per term. The announce-
ment, however, was premature.

To the freshmen women attend-.'

ing the sixth orientation session,
the mistake was disappointing
but the majority still plan to at-
tend the. University this fall.

‘News’ Staffers
Win Awards

The Pitt News won four awards .

in the 1966 Publications Contest
sponsored by Pi Delta Epsilon,
honorary journalism fraternity
for collegiate newspapers.

In’ the feature story category,
third place was awarded to Bill
Jerome, Pitt News columnist, for,
his artical “Pitt News Reviewsf
Batman.”

In the news division, honor-,
able mention was -given to Bill
Cabin, former editor-in-chief, for
“National Defense Student Loan
To Be Cut.”

For “Invisible Man Gives Cagers
Another -Loss,” Tom Sacks, sports
editor, won an honorable men-
tion in sports  In the
photography department ‘honor-

Because of the scholarships and
loans available to students, many
felt they could pay the higher
tuition. To non scholarship hold-
ers, however, the added cost did
make a difference.

Beatrice Dubich, a tall’ blond
from Baldwin Borough, said that
without the tuition cut she would
have trouble ﬁnancing her educa-,
tion. “I . was planning -to go to,

night schoo ,” said Miss Dubich, ’

“but I changed my mind when I
heard about the tuition reduc-
tion. We were very happy when
we read of the cut in the news-
papers, and though it hasn’t hap-,
penedyet, I'm sure it will come”,

One freshman, Ernestine Ru-_.
berto, said that without the tui-

. tion out she would not be able

to attend in the fall.

Phyllis Kanarkowski, a brown
hair-brown eyed freshman from
North Braddock, Pa., said that
she knows many people who are
Planning to drop out and work

for a year if the tuition stays at _

the same level. “They rather stay
out and come here a year later
than go to a community college,"
said Miss Kanarkowski. “Pitt has
a very goodname.”

Ann Marie Clark, a silver blond

from ._Syracus’e, } N. ,Y.,_ *wasn’t

  

its unfair that out-of-state stu-
dents pay more,” said Miss Clark.‘
Ironically, Miss Clark lived, in
Pennsylvania until she was 15
before moving to New York.

Several of the prospective com-
muters mentioned that they

would apply for housing if tui_-. _

tion was cut. “Although I'm sure
that I'm coming to Pitt,” said
Carol’ Muir, a prospective engi-
neering student from Pittsburgh,
I have had to hold-off applying
for housing until I see the aca-
demic, costs.”

With the exception of out-of-
stat_er Ann Marie Clark, the wom-
en all agreed that the University
and the staterelatedness ques-,
tion were both big topics of con-
versation at home. i

Math Prof
Helps India

Dr. John C. Knipp, mathemat-
ics professor at .the University,
is spending six weeks in India as
a consultant to a science institute
at Andhra University. _

He is one of 250 American edu-
cators in a program of the U.S.

Agency for International Devel..

Dmen Th  rogi-a‘

Dr. Irwin J. Schulman, instruc
tor in political science and sec-

retary of the Pittsburgh Academ-._~
ic Ad Hoc Committee for the?
Statement on Vietnam, which
sponsored the advertisement, said 

that the action was taken mainly
because Pittsburgh academians
had not been contacted to sign a
full page advertisement that‘ap-

peared in the New York,Time

This also urged reconsideration
of a Vietnam Policy. “We didn-

want people to think that mem- A

'bers of the Pittsburgh academic
community weren’t in sympathy
with the scholars who signed the
Times ad,” explained Dr. Richard,
Cottam, associate professor‘ of 
litical science. V’ .. ..,.\‘.\.
Members of the academic.co‘m_-
mittee on Vietnam hope to raise
enough money to rerun the ad
vertisement in the Washington‘
Post. Schulman felt that it would
have the most effect in a pa.-
per closer to national decision
makers. ~ - _ _ 5'
However, Cottam adinittedithal
the ad _won’t have any substan-
tial effect. He considers the plac-

ing of the ad as a “symbolic act P 

It has the main effect of-reh
ing the frustrations of Pittsburgh
academians,” noted Cottam.‘ V" _
In respect to the Vietnam sit-
uation, Cottam felt that “tactical
errors of horrible proportions"

of the war. He did not ,disagr_ee,
however, with the general policy
of containment of Red China;
The drive to run the advertise-
ment was initiated at the~Uni: 
sity. About ‘a half dozen facul
members collaborated in deci’
to take some action, according
'to Schulman. _ f _
The advertisement was paid for
by the educators who signed ‘it
and the drive was conducted‘ din
less than a week, continued
man.

:..-( “Enough of the facts are in
.,jto substantially indicate that
‘war, is a pretty bad thing.

freedom in Vietnam is cost-
ingthe lives of thousands in
_a rather irrevocable manner.

EVEN WORSE, at home
our Vietnam involvement is
, inﬂaming people with opin-
, ionated anger. Some say
that the “peaceniks” are
part of the spreading cob-
-“webbery of the Commie ﬁfth
column, busi-
ly subverting
everything
American and
peddling the
philosophies
of the Jewish
rascal Marx.
When people
talk like that,
SUPANSIC you can’t win:
ifwhat they are saying is
false, a lot of people are go-
ing to have red faces and a
a lot of innocent Americans
.will have been wrongfully
. viliﬁed.

On the other hand if what
they are saying is really
true, then the Commie con-
spiracy has gotten off to such
a slam—bang headstart, that
nothing can be done about it
anyway. The whole issue has
been overplayed by the press.

,; , TO INSURE A little more
 domestic tranquillity, Ihave
3 —a proposal for avoiding some
_ of the more sobering aspects
of our Vietnam involvement
. while still standing fast to
‘ our principles. My plan: I
simply suggest that the De-
fense Department do a Sys-
tems Cost Analysis on one
of its larger “search-and-
destroy” operations.

 

 

Figuring the cost of the
operation down to the last
penny, and dividing by the
estimated Viet Cong killed
and wounded, we would ar-
rive at a basic cost-per-cas-
_ ualty-inﬂicted ﬁgure. I pro-

pose that the United States
 then establish this ﬁgure as
 a standard bounty price on
many conﬁrmed Viet Cong
casualty.

 

MA Modest Proposal

,-The current war for human '

by Bob Supansic

MERCENARIES AND pro-
fessional soldiers from all
over the world would seek
employment in Vietnam, al-
lowing the gradual withdraw
of U.S. troops. Being profes-
sionals, these men would pro-
secute the war efficiently
and economically. If one can
build the world’s greatest
steel industry upon the prof-
it motive, why should one
leave national survival to re-
latively hazardous acts of
principle?

The economic prosperity
which we are currently en-
joying as a result of a war
in which our people are be-
ing killed is, I think, a source
of embarrassment to the
American people. My propos-
al would eliminate that em-
barrassment.

SOME PEOPLE are fright-
ened, others enraged, that
Secretary McNamara can
take such a cold, calculating,
quartermaster’s view of the
war. My proposal would ren-
der that attitude appropri-
ate.

Lastly, our boys would be
home again and we would be
aiding the people of Vietnam
in the only real way we
know: by properly funding
their war.
