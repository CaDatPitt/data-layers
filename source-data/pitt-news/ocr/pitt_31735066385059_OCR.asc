Blood sample found
from Wes tern Psych

By Scot Ross

News Editor

The investigation concerning
how a blood sample from
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic was found broken outside
of Presbyterian-University Hospi-
tal is just beginning, according to
Institute spokeswoman Gloria
Acklin Kreps.

’’Until we see the blood, we
would have no way of knowing
what might have happened,” she
said. .

The incident involves Pitt

_sophomore Jim Acierno who,

when returning from class at ap-
proximately 12:30 p.m. on Mon-
day, came across and discarded
an empty blood specimen con-
taineron the emergency entrance
side of the hospital on DeSoto
Street.

Yesterday at approximately
1:30 p.m., while returning from
another class, Acierno found yet
another vial. This one, however,

was broken, and contained the
blood of a patient at Western Psy-
chiatric Institute and Clinic.

”[On Monday], I saw a vial,
one of the vacutainers they draw
blood from, and it looked like it
wasn't used, and it was sitting out
in the middle and I almost
stepped on it, so I picked it up,
walked down the “street and
threw it in the trashcan," Acier-
no said.

Aceirno said that he didn't
think much of it until today when
he saw ”a vial again in just about

the same place. It was broken, it’

had blood in it, dried blood, had
a person's name on it."

He said that at that time, he
decided to carefully pick up the
container and see that something
was done about it.

”The thing that concerns me,”
he said, ”is that there seems to be
a great apathy [among the two
hospitals] about it.”

He added, ”Late|y in the last

Phi Delta Theta house
undergoes new facelift

By Mike Hudson

For The Pitt News

Phi Delta Theta has taken up
the task of completely remodel-
ing its fraternity house in an ef—
fort to improve living conditions,
as well as to help promote a posi-
tive fraternity house image.

”We were tired of the house’

being a public eyesore," said Ron
Bizick, external vice president for
the house». Bizick is also a mem-
ber of the labor force involved in
the project.

Bizick said that the house
members do the ”dirty work,”
like tearing things down and then
cleaning up.

”The contractors are the ones
who are doing the carpentry,
plumbing and wiring,” Bizick

added.

”When the house is done, we
want it to be the model fraternity
house for the university. Hopeful-

ly, our effort will motivate others ,

to do the same for their houses,”
Bizick explained.

The estimated cost of complete
restoration will be $100,000, and
so far $18,000 has been raised,
according to Tim McLaughlin,
chapter president

The project, which began at the
end of last semester and is sched-
uled for completion by Septem-
ber of 1989, will be done in three
phases.

The first phase, which is
presently in progress, consists of
outside restoration.

Released Singh grieves for those still captive in Lebanon

By lamal Halaby

Associated Press Writer

DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- In-
dian Professor Mithileshwar
Singh said Tuesday his kidnap-
pers treated him well during 20
months as a hostage in Lebanon,
but ”there is no substitute for
freedom,” and he grieves for
those still held.

His release Monday leaves
nine Americans and seven other

foreigners still in the hands of ex-
tremist Moslem kidnappers in
Lebanon. Held longest is Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East cor-
respondent of The Associated
Press, who was abducted March
1 6, 1 985.

Singh, a 60-year-old resident
alien of the United States, was re-
united with his wife, Lalmani, at
the U.S. Embassy on Tuesday af-
ternoon. He was freed Monday
night in Beirut and driven to

"Damascus by Syrian army

officers, then turned over to U.S.
Ambassador Edward Djerjian.

A special U.S. Air Force plane
arrived to take him to an Ameri-
can military hospital in Wies-
baden, West Germany, for a
medical checkup.

”Our plans, depending on
logistical arrangements, are to
transport him to Wiesbaden for
further medical checks and then
on to the U.S.,” Djerjian said.

He said Singh had asked to be
allowed to rest, and "given the
circumstances, he is feeling rela-
tively well.” A Syrian doctor
pronounced him fit to travel.

In New Delhi, the ‘Foreign
Ministry said India had worked
for Singh’s release through con-
tacts ”with the Syrian gover-
ment” and others.

The captive was released to the
U.S. ambassador ”because of thé
confusion that still exist ” in the

Middle East about his nationali-
ty, a spokesman said.

India has maintained Singh was
kidnapped because his abductors
thought he was an American.

Armed men dressed as~poIice-
men took Singh hostage Jan. 24,
1987, on the Beirut University
College campus in Moslem west
Beirut, along with Americans

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 5, I988

State senate approves new education assistance

HARRISBURG (AP) — The
Senate Education Committee on
Tuesday approved legislation
designed to help families meet
the ballooning cost of college
education.

The bill, sponsored by Senate
President Pro Tem Robert
Jubelirer, R-Blair, would enable

parents to purchase college tui-

tion credits at state-related or
state-owned schools that could
be redeemed when a child is
ready to attend.

Participation by private col-
leges or universities would be
voluntary.‘

Under the legislation, the
money paid for credits at state-
owned and state-related schools
would be deposited in a fund ad-
ministered by the Department of
the Treasury. If the interest earned
on the investment is not enough
to cover tuition when a child is
ready to attend school, the state
would cover the difference.

A separate reserve account
would be established for private
schools to cover any cost
differential. ‘ I

The legislation would not go
into effect until the program is
reviewed for tax-exempt status by
the Internal Revenue Service. The
bill now moves to the Appropri-
ations Committee for con-
sideration.

Pennsylvania leads
nation in rabies

HARRISBURG (AP) —— The
state Health Department said
Tuesday that preliminary federal
figujresshow Pennsylvania leads
the nation in confirmed rabies
cases.

According to the department,
45 cases of animal rabies were
reported in September, boosting
the tally this year to 388. Those
figures reveal a sharp increase

been confirmed through Sep-
tember.

The department said figures
from the Centers for Disease Con-
trol indicate Pennsylvania is lead-
ing the nation in rabies, followed
by Texas, California, Virginia and
Maryland.

cases have occurred in Chester
County, which leads the state
with 127 this year. In September,
the county reported 15 cases, the
department said.

Lancaster County ranks second
in the state, with 99 confirmed
cases, including seven in Septem-
ber. Armstrong and Montgomery
counties recorded their first cases
during the month, the department
said.

The majority of cases in the

State workforce
down, industry up

STATE COLLEC E,.Pa. (AP) — A
new economic indicator shows
Pennsylvania's industrial produc-
tivity has increased, while the

workforce has declined in recent
years, a Penn State economist
said Tuesday.

Production increased 20 per-
cent while the workforce
declined 7 percent, comparing
the first eight months of this year
to 1982-83, said William D. An-
derson, editor of the ”Pennsylva-
nia Business Survey.”

Anderson developed the new
indicator, the Pennsylvania
Manufacturing Activity Index,
which measures the total dollar
value of manufacturing output,
adjusting for inflation. -

Previously, economists meas
ured Pennsylvania's manufactur-
ing sector in terms of the number
of workers, wages and the aver-
age factory work week.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 5, I988

 

By Suzanne Sabol
For The Pitt News

Imagine a place where a
man could be thrown into jail
for criticizing another’s work
and where the government
tells a poet what to write
about. This place exists behind
the Iron Curtain, where writers
and artists live in fear of the
Communist government.

This situation was the topic
of a lecture last evening by Dr.
Peter Hruby, a Czechoslova-
kian professor from Western
Australia Technological
University.

Hruby’s presentation was.

entitled ”JarosIav Seifert’s
Communist dream and night-
mare.” Hruby explained that
Seifert was a Nobel Prize-
winning Czech poet whose
experiences were typical of
other artists and writers who
lived through the Communist
Revolution.

Seifert and his‘ colleagues
were very influential in
Czechoslovakia after World
War I. They were rewarded for
glorifying Communism in their
writings.

Many of the writers actually
believed that Communism
would work and promoted a

Professor stresses creative writing freedoms

bloody revolution.

After the Communist party
took over, the writers had their
dream realized. However, the
reality did not match the
dream.

Seifert and other writers be-
gan to see the people suffer
under the new regime, but
they were now powerless to
help. When Seifert criticized
the policy, he was expelled
from the party and was singled
out as a bad influence.

Seifert’s former friends at-
tacked him, and the officials
called him ”dangerous to the
country.” His poems were

confiscated during house
searches, and portions were
removed from his writings.

The final blow occurred one
evening over a glass of wine
when he mentioned that he
preferred French poets to Rus-
sians. Seifert actually said, ”A
vomiting Frenchman is dearer
to me than a singing Russian.”

Fortunately for Seifert, a
powerful Russian friend inter-
vened for him, and Seifert was
spared prison. From that point
on, he promoted the cause of
the unfairly imprisoned
writers.

Hostage g

Continued from page 1

A group calling itself IsIamicJi-
had for the Liberation of Palestine
claimed responsibility, and said
it freed Singh as a goodwill
gesture to the United States.
Nearly all the foreign hostages in
Lebanon are believed held by

Shiite Moslem groups loyal to‘

Iran.

A U.S. official in Damascus
said the Americans decided to ac-
cept custody because Singh had
applied for citizenship before his
abduction.

Singh said Tuesday he felt
”wonderful” and added: ”Thank
God I'm free, but I'm very sorry
that my colleagues and friends
are still in captivity. I hope they'll
be free soon.”

He was cIean—shaven, dressed
in a gray suit, and he appeared
before dozens of reporters at the
Syrian Foreign Ministry after a
brief chat with Djerjian. He was
brought in through a back door
at about 11 a.m.

Steen, Polhill and Turner were
the only hostages he saw while
in captivity, Singh said.

Asked about the conditions un-
der which he was held, he said:
”The treatment was better than -I
had expected, but there's no sub-

stitute [for] freedom in this gt»

world.”

His captors provided medicine
for his chronic diabetes, Singh
said, but he appeared hesistant
about discussing details of his

captivity.

After a few questions, he said:
”Please. I'm very tired now. 
Respect my feeling of freedom.”

Singh said the four captives

In Washington, President Rea-

said liberating them ”has been a

The White House said pleasure

was ”tempered

Americans" are still hostages.

Sheik Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah, spiritual head of the
Iranian—backed Hezbollah, or

saying the hostages ”would have
to wait for the outcome of the
American presidential election.”
He said Iran prefers to deal with
the Republicans.

‘Images Abroad

Traveler sees England as more than the popular misconceptions

They always ask me,”You
studied in England? London must
have been so exciting.”

Then they begin to imagine a
place filled with stiff upper-lipped

‘snobs wearing letter jackets, silk
scarves and dusty white wigs, sit-
ting around drinking tea and

quibbling over why the English
lost the American Revolution.

Others imagine handsome,
muscular men rowing down calm
rivers to meet beautiful young la-
dies wearing nothing more than
silk boxer shorts.

‘ Music lovers imagine England
as a playhouse to meet punks
with purple-green hair and ap-
propriately ripped clothes, while
touring all the hot spots in
London.

But this is not the England that

I lived for nine months in a
storybook city complete with
cobblestone streets, a beautiful
cathedral, and a winding river
surrounding it all.

Durham, with its 30,000 resi-
dents, is a place where people
still smile and say, ”Cheers!” as
they walk along the narrow
streets. _

Old men sit in the local pubs
drinking pints of ”bitter” which
look as dark as ink, while young
mothers push their ”prams,” or
baby carriages, over the stone
bridges. A

When not attending lectures,
the 5,000 students who attend
the university in the city can be
found in the tea rooms, pubs, or
on the riverbanks watching others
row or scull.

In these ways, Durham is like
the familiar images of ”typical
England,” but it is also very
different.

The students there combine the

 

their own personalities.

For instance, three times during
each term, the colleges of the
university have ”formal” dinners
in which the men must wear
”d.j.s,” or tuxedos, and the wom-
en must wear dresses.

After grace is said in Latin and
the college dean, dressed in a
black gown, speaks about stu-
dents’ responsibilities, the dinner
begins.

Each student usually opens his
or her own bottle of wine while

older women race through the
maze of white linen tables, bring-
ing the different courses of the
meal on platters. Toasts are
made, and drinking games such
as ”whiskers” or ”bunnies” are
played, usually resulting in intox-
Icatlon.

As the dinner ends, groups‘ of
students converge upon the col-
lege pub and proceed to order
”pints” of their favorite alcohol-
ic beverage, like ”purple nasties”
and “green deaths.” ’

The students proceed to spill
these drinks all over their d.j.s
and silk dresses before the bar
closes at its usual time — 10:30
p.m. .

Though there may be hand-
some muscular rowers and men
with white wigs, the England I
know consists of people who,
when they party all night, wake
up the next morning, gossip and
then exclaim, ’’I don't remember
thatl”

* Teacher strike is an

event to be avoided

Rep. Alice Langtry of the Pennsylvania state Senate is sponsor-
ing a bill which would deduct pay from schoolteachers who strike
even if they make up for all the lost days. But the bill is having
problems getting to the House floor and will probably either be
defeated or will not make it to the floor before the Senate adjourns
for the year. Attempts to change the state's law on collective bar-
gaining by public employees have been unsuccessful in the past

as well.

Such a policy, however, should be considered. Pennsylvania has
had one-quarter of all school strikes nationwide since 1970.

A strike not only deprives students of an education, it makes
truancy the community's No. 1 problem while it continues. To
be a teacher takes a lot of dedication, and that dedication shouldn't
be thrown out the window when the subject of money comes up.

A strike is not the answer to the problem. When teachers strike,
everybody loses: the students, the teachers, the parents and the
school administrators. Thebill, which would dock a day of a strik-
ing teacher's pay, is a good one because it does not directly for-
bid striking, but it is a strong deterrent which would keep teachers
from striking unless they felt it would be worth the docked pay.

We sympathize with frustrated, underpaid teachers but hope they
understand that their job is too important to let money disrupt it.

Chernobyl explosion as near

In fact, though, the number of
problems surrounding nuclear
energy are fairly minimal when
stacked alongside those caused
by the fossil fuels.

No one has ever been killed in
a mine cave-in while trying to
mine atoms. No tanker has ever

I recently visited an arms fac-
tory where George Bush was ex-
pected later in the day.

”Does this plant make fire-

arms?” I asked Baskerville, one of
Bush's advance men.-
”No,” he said. ’’It produces arms
that you can place across your
chest when you're reciting the
Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.
It's the largest right-arm factory in
the world, and business is boom-
ing since the candidate made the
flag the main issue of his
campaign.”

”Are they meant for people
who don't have right arms?” I
asked.

”No, these are for citizens who
have their own arms. The
manufactured arm makes it pos-
sible to recite the Pledge and ap-
plaud Bush at the same time.”

”It’s a miracle,” I exclaimed.

”Before Reagan, Americans
didn't care if they had an arm to
pledge with or not. But the
Republicans changed all that, and
the demand for a right arm to put
over your heart has swept the na-
tion. They're not very expensive.
They sell for $9.95 each.”

“Does Bush own any of
these?”

”Of course. If you say the
Pledge of Allegiance as often as
he does, you have to keep a
truckload for emergencies.

and ending up in downtown
Beijing.

The problem with nuclear
energy is that its opponents think
it's too good to be true. How can
something that doesn't pollute
the atmosphere, doesn't take up
much space, doesn't threaten
workers’ lives with black lung
disease and doesn't cost much
compared to the fossil forms of
energy be wrong?

Well, because the nuclear mat-
ter could melt down to the earth's
core and ruin everyone’s day,
that's why.

But then, France has the largest
number of nuclear reactors per
square mile, and no Frenchmen
are around complaining. There
also don't happen to be many
problems with nuclear reactors
built by France.

Perhaps part of the problem

is that it doesn't receiver much
support, despite the amount of
sense it makes to have more of it.
Americans are so paranoid when
it comes to finding faults with
nuclear reactors that they scare
the builders into near—hiding,
turning a simple construction site
into a hideout.

It would go without saying that
if Americans were better educat-
ed on the subject of nuclear ener-
gy, they would be lessafraid of
it and more eager to embrace it.
Nuclear energy has the potential
to replace nearly every other form
of energy. True, the gasoline en-
gine may be the only way of ever
powering an automobile, but ci-
ties don't need to burn coal or oil
to produce electricity when a few
atoms will do the job.

Possibly the strongest argument
for switching over to nuclear

energy on a large scale would be
the ways it would actually save
the environment. Strip mining for
coal would disappear. Devastat-
ing wilderness to make way for

oil drilling would be done away .

Complainers who wonder
where nuclear waste would be
stored are forgetting that the
space shuttle could send such
material on a collision course
with the sun.

In the end, it seems like such
a silly thing to be on the side
against nuclear energy. Instead of
trying to ban such a boon to so-
ciety, maybe they should channel
their energies into forcing reactor
builders to make them more safe.

  PERSPECTIVE

Boring race caused by the press

The complaint has become
universal. Most newspapers have
joined in the refrain. All seem to
agree that this is a dull presiden-
tial campaign. And whose fault is
it?

At the National Conference of
Editorial Writers meeting (in Fort
Worth) last week, a newspaper
publisher took what might be
called thePogo approach to the
question. Richard Connor, pub-
lisher of the Fort Worth Star-
Telegram, "told the editorial
writers that the newspaper indus-
try is largely to blame for putting
out the fire in national politics. In
other words, we in the
newspaper business have met the
enemy, and he is us!

Conner said that newspapers
are no longer controlled by peo-
ple of passion and, as a result,
”our editorial pages have be-
come pages of consensus  we
simply outline problems, exa-
mine issues and ponder topics —
but we really don't tell anybody
what we think about those

J problems and topics. We don't
take a firm, unequivocal stand on
issues of vital importance to our
readers and our communities.”

The problem is not limited to
newspapers. A television exam-
ple of what Conner was talking
about occurred on ABC's This
Week program. The subject was

fetal tissue experimentation, and
correspondent Sam Donaldson
said he didn't know how he felt
about the procedure. And then
National Public Radio's Cokie
Roberts said that we used to
know when life began and when
it ended, but now we don't know
this anymore because our nation

CAL J
THOMAS

has become more ”pluralistic.”

So, pluralism, rather than ob-
jective truth, is the standard, and
pluralism means that all ideas
about anything are to be treated
as equal until a majority rules on
them. I '

This line of ”thinking," if it can
be called that, is at the center of
Conner’s complaint: ”I find that
the editorial pages that I read
across the country all too often
provide only a wonderful gather-
ing in one spot of all too relevant
facts about an issue and in the
end offer the equivalent of what
I would call ’-and so, that's the
way it is.’ In effect, wesay to the
reader, ’you be the judge.’

”Well, I would like to see the
newspaper be the judge. I would
like to see us say, ‘That's the way
it is —r and now here's what we

‘ think about it, here's what we

want you to think about it, and
here's what must be done about
it.’ " _

Conner wants the phrase ”on
the other hand” banished from
the vocabulary of editorial
writers. He thinks that would
help breathe fire back into
editorial pages and, by extension,
into the voters and the candidates
for office. J

Says Conner, this refusal to
build fires has resulted in a lack
of interest on the part of the pub-
lic, and that apathy has spawned
a lack of respect. ”They don't
look to us for leadership,” he
says, ”because we have chosen
not to lead.’’ 

He is right. We live in an era
when the worst sin is intolerance.
The preferred position is that truth
either does not exist -or, if it does,
it cannot be determined except
by the consensus of others who
also do not recognize truth when
they see it.

It is this dilution of truth that
makes campaigns like this one so
dull. And the newspapers, for all
their complaining, would do well
to examine their own contribu-
tion to what might be called the
”dumbing down” of the political
mind. V

Disturbing facts about Quayle

My friend Miehael and I were
sitting up at the UHC yesterday,
doing what most college students
like ourselves were doing, engag-
ing in an intellectual discussion,
when our talk turned to the cur-
rent race for the presidency. Sud-
denly Michael said, ”What do
you get when you cross a chick-

’ en with a hawk?”

”I don't know, what?” I said.

“A Quayle.” . .

I screamed. Yet another joke on
Vice President Bush's choice for
a running mate. First Dukakis,

. who is a ca.rtoonist’s dream, and
now Dan Quayle, a cynic’s pleas-
ure. Oh, what a fun election!

But wait a minute, didn't rock
superstar Sting say at a recent
Amnesty International Concert,
”The two scariest words in the
English language  President
Qualye.”? He wasn't kidding, he

I was serious. Come to think of it,
so was Michael's joke. Hmmm 
maybe this isn't such a fun
election. , A

Bush stands for biglbusiness,
the arms race and much of what
the Reagan administration stood
for. (If we really even know what
that was.)

Bentsen is like someone’s
grandfather, who is tough on for-
eign issues and abortion.

Then there is Dan Quayle. He
stands for  ummm  his poli-
cies include well, I'm not real-
ly sure what he stands for or
advocates. The most I remember
about Quayle is the hype about
his looking like Robert Redford

i (What?), and I remember him
jumping up and down when he
got the nomination (calm down,
Dan).

With any important election,
there is no doubt going to be
some sort of mudslinging. Reagan
made an ”offhand" remark about
Dukakis’ mental abilities, and
Dukakis asked Bush at the debate

if he remembered what he was
talking about a moment before.
I can't honestly remember any-
thing negative about Bentsen, he
seems to be relatively quiet thus
far. But Quayle  one has to seri-
ously ask himself, in light of re-
Cent evidence concerning him,
whether it's mudslinging or if it
is the truth.

It may seem that I have been
too subjective in my view of
Quayle so far, but here are some

JESSICA
COLVILLE

facts on the man and his family:

Quayle’s father, James Quayle,-

was a member of the ultraconser-
vative John Birch Society in the
19605. - .

Quayle’s mediocre academic
record apparently stopped him
from applying to major universi-
ties. Instead, he went to DePauw
University, where his grandfather
was a member of the DePauw
board of trustees and a major
contributor.

Quayle’s college record fluctu-
ated so greatly that a furor erupt-
ed in 1982 when the college
announced it would award an
honorary doctor of laws degree to
Quayle. The faculty secretly vot-
ed 32-34 against awarding the
degree.

When Quayle was in the Na-
tional Guard, he worked in the
public information office, where
he was supposed to write articles
for the local National Guardsmen
magazine. His commanding
officer said a review of the maga-
zines published during Quayle’s
service shows that he did not
author a single by-lined story dur-
ing his service.

”I was interested in joining the
National Guard,” Quayle said,

”because it enabled me to go into
law school as soon as possible.”

However, Quayle did not attend

law school right away. He did not

meet the academic requirements

of Indiana University's law
school and ”They wouldn't let
him in,” his father told the
Washington Post.

A year later, ”Somehow he got
in, he talked his way in,” and at-
tended night school, Quayle’s
father said. ‘ _

Those are some facts for one to
ponder. While you're deep in
thought, here are some reactions
from Quayle’s classmates while
he attended DePauw:

Clark Adams, a former class-
mate, said: ”I was in college with
the guy for three years, and the
only thing I remember is he was
on the golf team and was quite
the ladies’ man.

”This is in 1968. To be politi-
cally apathetic in those years was
a to be a nonentity on campus.
He was not a guy to take position
on anything except who his date
was on Friday night and where to
get drunk on Saturday night.”

Yet another classmate, Joseph
Wirt, said Quayle majored in
”girls, golf and alcohol” at
DePauw.

I know, I know it's tough to be
straightedge in college. I mean,
how many of us are worried
when we go to C.J.’s on Friday
that maybe someday, that person
we just got plastered with is go-
ing to describe us in a deragato-
ry fashion to the press hounds?

All I can say is that I am honest-
ly afraid that, if Bush is elected
and somehow Quayle becomes
president, what harm is this man
going to do?

ticle in the Sept. 22 edition of
The Pitt News which dealt
with the damage students do
to apartments. Although I am
sure that students indeed do
cause a certain amount of
damage, I think something
needs to be said about the off-
campus housing in which
many Pitt students live and the
’’slum |and|ords” who
”manage” them.

Last year when I was assist-
ing my daughter in her search
for an apartment in Oakland,
I was appalled at the condition
of those we were shown.
Some of the apartments were
unoccupied at the time and
the management company
representative tried to pressure
us to take one as soon as pos-
sible, as they were ”going
fast.” He tried to convince us
how nice they were, how
freshly painted and carpeted
and what a ”bargain” they
were. Well, we certainly did
not put down any deposit that
day. I wouldn't have my fish
live in those places. They were
not secure; they were fire traps
(one was a basement with no
windows; one had the win-
dows painted shut); and in one
tiny place, the hall between
rooms was so narrow that only
one person could fit through
— if she turned sideways!
Needless to say, like any
mother, I was so upset I went
home and cried and lay awake
long into the night worrying
about my daughter and the
horrors that might befall her.

If these companies had any
conscience at all, they would
not have let their apartments
get into the hopeless state of
disrepair they are in now. It is
easy to place the blame on the
students. I say a large portion
of the blame lies with the
management companies.

Other side of equal rights

In regard to Ms. DeLauter’s ar-
ticle ”Tired of Being Pushed
Around,” in the Sept. 28 Pitt
News, we'd like to share some
of our facts and fantasies. Let's
talk about equality. Equality is
given to us by law. Both men

and women are permitted to .

drive at age 16. At age 18, we

. can vote and be drafted into

the military. When we are 21
years old, we can drink. But
for some reason, at certain
ages, car insurance is cheaper
for women than for men. Also,
if there was a conventional
war, how many women
would it take to carry an M-60
machine gun? It doesn't mat-
ter anyway. Women don't
have to register for the draft.

What about mental capaci-
ty? In her article, Ms. DeLaut-
er made the major discovery
that women and men are men-
tally equal. Wow, what a con-

cept. So what's her point? She
said men make more money
(40 percent) for doing the
same job. What job is she
referring to, and where do
these figures come from?
Where we're from, job dis-
crimination (any kind) based
on race, sex, creed or religous
"background is illegal. Perhaps
these alleged men make more
money at some jobs for other
reasons, like seniority, perfor-
mance or good behavior. Ms.
DeLauter is only a minority
because of her thinking, not
because she is a woman.
Another thing that puzzled
us about the. wonderfully in-
formative and fact-filled article
is the use of the stereotype
when referring to other kinds
of feminists. She categorized
the other kind of feminist but
complained about being
categorized herself. Come to
think of it, isn't she categoriz-
ing everything? When it
comes down to it, in today's
competitive job market, it is
not man vs. woman or white
vs. black, but individual vs. in-
dividual. We think Ms.
DeLauter missed the point of
her own article. (Maybe she
was too busy doing her hair.)
Well, we hope someday Ms.
DeLauter finds all of what it is
she's looking for (although,
like a lot of females, she prob-
ably doesn't know what it is),
including her ”Mr. Right/"But
for now, as Morrissey once
said, ”You just haven't earned
it yet, baby.”

Unfair criticism of Pitt band

My letter is in reference to the
article by Vince Carey which
was a critique of the Pitt vs.
West Virginia football game’.
Within the article, he made

/ the statement, ’’It looked like

the West Virginia band had
more members than the Pitt
football team. Maybe the Pitt
band should take a cue from
them.”

I am a member of the Pitt
band, and his comment really
upset me. Does he realize
how much time and effort is
put into each and every show?
Obviously not. We (the band)
practice 13 to 15 hours a
week. This entails memorizing
new music each week along
with learning the marching.
We practice Saturday morn-
ings for two to two-and-one-
half hours before the games. I
don't think anyone has the
right to put the band down un-
til they've experienced a full
week of practices. It is impor- I
tant that we, the University of I
Pittsburgh, show some sort of
unity. That is, the students, the
cheerleaders, the athletes and
the band. Are we not at the
game for the-same reason? To"
show school spirit? Like the
old saying goes, Mr. Carey, it's
quality, not quantity.

The Pitt women's volleyball
team demolished Duquesne on

_ Monday evening in three straight

games by the scores of 15-4, 15-2

1 and 15-2.

The Lady Panthers ju_mped off
to a 5-0 lead in game one behind
the serve of sophomore setter
Jenelle Lantagne, who tallied two
aces in the process.

After Duquesne scored two
quick points to make the score

5-2, Pitt, led by Julie Sheils’ three
aces, expanded the lead to 13-2‘.
Duquesne then scored two points
before Kelly Matheis closed out
the game with a pair of aces.
The Lady Panthers did little to
bring Duquesne back to life in
the second game. Racing off to an
11-1 lead, Pitt surrendered but
one more point before merciful-
“ly closing out the game.
Freshman Sue Zonneville
dominated play at the net in
game two with five kills and
chipped in with an ace on the

serve.

In the third game, Nancy
Fierschnaller decided to treat Du-
quesne to a serving clinic. The
score was 2-1 in Pitt's favor when
Fierschnaller decided to all but
close out the match with a
wicked top-spin serve. By the
time Duquesne got another side-
out, they were trailing 10-1 and
sinking fast.

Freshman Bridget Gary showed
Duquesne there is no relief in

sight for future match-ups against

The Panthers will have to forget the BC game when they play Notre Dame this Saturday.

‘Sims makes big splash in Pitt defensive line

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

Transferring from one college
to another is tough on any stu-
dent.‘ For an athlete, the burden
is doubled because of the NCAA
rule that makes him sit out a year.
He can only watch from the side-
lines while teammates he has
practiced with are playing the
game.

Pitt defensive tackle Tom Sims
is someone who had to go
through this. Sims transferred
from Western Michigan after the
1986 season, but he hasn't
suffered.

”I think that [being a transfer]

gave him a year to watch our sys-
tem,” Pitt coach Mike Gottfried
said. ”It gave him a chance to get
a little stronger, a little better and
a little bigger. I think it has helped
him. Right now, he's in the flow
of things and playing very well.”

The stat sheet has shown it.
Sims is fourth on the team in tack-
les, with 25. He leads the defense
with four sacks and is second
with six quarterback hurries. Sims
has been a frequent visitor in op-
ponent backfields.

”Tom has done a very good
job,” defensive tackle Richard Al-
len said. ”With each game, he is
getting better. His aggressiveness
has been getting better and bet-

ter. He has definitely helped our
defense."

The Panthers are a disappoint-
ing 2-2 right now, but Sims feels
that the team can still have a suc-
cessful season.

”We have lost two tough
games,” Sims, 6 foot 4, 240
pounds, said. ”But this is playoff
time — we can still obtain a lot
of goals we have set. We just
have to do it now; it begins this
week.” .

At Western Michigan, Sims to-
taled 93 tackles, 51 of which are
unassisted. His coach there was
none other than Pitt assistant
head coach Jack Harbaugh.

”I just think thatjack is a good

kills and two aces in the game.

The easy win gave Pitt coach
Sue Hoover a chance to move
some players out of their spots in
the Pitt lineup.

In game three, Lantagne was
given the opportunity to play out-
side hitter for the first time since
high school as Shelly Seanor was
moved from the outside hitter po-
sition to setter.

The Lady Panthers received a
number of outstanding perfor-
mances.

Zonneville had a perfect even-

Volleyball team breezes past Lady Dukes

ing in registering five kills in five
attempts. ,

”I think my hitting has im-
proved. These last two weeks we
have worked hard to get ready for
the Arizona Classic [Oct. 13, 14
and 15]. Even though the teams
we have played have not been up
to our level, we have kept up the
intensity level,’’ said Zonneville,

Interim coach Sue Hoover
raved about Zonneville’s play: ”I
think Sue Zonneville had a great
match with five kills and zero hit-

Football team trying to
regroup for upcoming
game after tough loss

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

”This game right here -meant a
lot for their_season,” quarterback
Darnell Dickerson told reporters
last week after Pitt's loss to
Boston College. ’

Indeed, it did. BC was 1-3 and
had lost its starting quarterback,
Mark Kamphaus, to a broken jaw.
The 34-31 victory gave the Eagles
confidence and momentum.

But what about Pitt? Where
does their second losstin four
games put them?

”Not where we want to be,”
said linebacker Jerry Olsavsky.

No question. Pitt (2-2) faces
what could very well be the most
difficult team on their schedule,
No. *5 Notre Dame (4-O), this
weekend.

And it could be a make or
break outing. _

’’If we win, this will set a tone
for the rest of the season, no
doubt,” said defensive end
Richard Allen. ’”When you win,
the young guys are looking for-
ward to the next game; they're
looking forward to the end of the
season bowl game.”

And if anyone can agree with
Allen, it's freshman tailback Cur-
vin Richards, who will probably
see his second start of the season
due to an ankle injury to starter
Adam Walker.

”The team's been telling me to
keep my head up. There’s still
next week,” Richards said, refer-
ring to an untimely fumble that
BC converted. into the winning
points five days ago.

But one fumble does not a sea-

coach,” Sims said. ”He did a
good job there and is doing a
good job here.”

As far as the change goes, Sims
feels that there are distinct differ-
ences between the two schools,
but the game is still the same.

”You play the game on the
same size field, so it can't really
be that much of a difference,”
laughed Sims.

”Football is taken a lot more
seriously at Pitt, by the media and
the fans,” Sims continued.
”There aren't really other teams
like a Michigan Wolverines to
contend with."

Sims grew up in Detroit and
earned three football letters at

» up

son make. Richards gained in-
valuable experience in Boston,
rushing for 202 yards and two
touchdowns in place of Walker.

”It made me realize I can run
on the collegiate level, whether
it's BC out there, or Notre Dame,
or Penn State. It's all the same
thing, because it's the same game
of football no matter who you're
playing, just different personnel.”

It will be different personnel
again this weekend, but the same
two football teams that faced
each other last October when the
Irish were 3-0 and Pitt was 3-2.

_ Sound familiar?

Pitt put Ull a flint-lialf Qfféiinéiivié
show to defeat Notre Dame
30-22 and catapult to an 8-3 regu-
lar season finish and a bowl
game.

”There are a lot of similarities
[between this year and last],” said
Pitt coach Mike Gottfried. ”It’s a
similar situation, but we're a
different ball club right now.
We've just got to go game to
game and get a little bit better,
show improvement, because
that's a key for us right now.”

A victory over Notre Dame, un-
defeated through four weeks and
averaging over 301 points per
game, could very well instill the
same kind of confidence in this
year's Panther squad.

”Last year, we were in the
same position,” Allen said. ”We
lost two games, and Notre Dame
came in ranked. But the guys
played very well. So I think the
guys will play up again.”

What if Pitt loses?

Cass Tech on his way to becom-
ing an All-City player.

At the beginning of this season,
the Panther defense was consi-
dered ’a green group, starting
eight underclassmen. After four
games, they are playing like an
experienced group, holding op-
ponents to 136 passing yards per
game and 272.8 yards per game
on the ground. Good enough to
be ranked 21st in total defense.

”We have a talented defense,”
Sims said. ”We have the players
we need. The only thing is that
we can't have the mental break-
downs that we've had the last
two games.”

NEW YORK — Undisputed
heavyweight champion Mike Ty-
son is not, and has never been,
a manic depressive, a psychiatrist
said after examining the fighter
on Tuesday.

Dr. Abraham Halpern, the
chairman of the psychiatry
department of United Hospital at
Port Chester, N.Y., said Tyson
”showed no sign of abnormality.
He had no delusionary ideas.”

Tyson has been besieged by
personal problems since knock-
ing out Michael Spinks in his last
title defense in June.

After an auto accident last
month at Catskill, N.Y., Tyson
was evaluated by Dr. Henry
McCurtis at the urging of the
fighter’s wife, Robin Givens, and
mother-in-law, Ruth Roper.
McCurtis, a psychiatrist, diag-
nosed Tyson as a manic depres-
sive, and lithium carbonate was
prescribed.

Halpern said on Tuesday that
he had spoken to McCurtis, who
denied making that diagnosis.

”Dr. McCurtis used the expres-
sion ‘mood regulatory problems.’
There's something in that," Hal-
pern said, describing the fighter’s
frame of mind as ”most of the
time within the range of normal.

”He seemed a little under ten-

Halpern said the best thing for
Tyson would be to get back into
the ring.

Halpern’s examination came at
the urging of Bill Cayton, Tyson's
manager.

Tyson, 22, seemed to have

but has had little to cheer about
since.

The latest incident was a heat-
ed argument Sunday morning
with Givens in the couple's man-
sion at Bernardsville, N.J.

Tyson reportedly hurled a su-
gar bowl and chairs through win-
dows during a fit of anger
apparently sparked by interviews
given to Barbara Walters by
Givens and Roper on ABC's
20-20.

Police said they handled the in-
cident involving Tyson and
Givens, a star on the television
show Head of the Class, like any
other domestic case and, as far as

‘fit as a fiddle

they are concernedgthe matter is
closed.

”This is a domestic violence in-
cident not unlike many others,
except for the fact that it involves
a public figure,” Bernardsville
Police Chief Thomas J. Sciaretta
said during a news conference
Monday.

Sciaretta, revealing few details,
said no one was injured or arrest-
ed and that Givens did not want
to sign a domestic violence com-
plaint.

Tyson, who married Givens
eight months ago, told the New
York Daily News, ’’I’m hurt be-
cause I'm in love.”

Fierschnaller administered the

game three with her serve, at one
time registering four consecutive
aces.

’’I’m glad, since it was Sue's

pleased with my serving because
I haven't been playing well in

Jeffries should see a lot
of time during playoffs

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A cou.
ple of days before the season end-
ed, New York Mets manager
Davey Johnson named Gregg
Jefferies his third baseman for the
playoffs and gave the rookie a
reason to celebrate for real.

The Mets led Pittsburgh by
seven games in the National
League East when Jefferies was
summoned from Class AAA
Tidewater to replace the injured
Wally Backman on Aug. 27.

”The plan was to use Gregg as
a pinch hitter and late-inning
replacement,” Johnson said.

The plan changed, and so did
the Mets’ sputtering offense.

In Jefferies’ first start on Aug. 28
against San Francisco, he went
2-for-5. The next day, against San
Diego, he was 3-for-4 with a dou-
ble, triple and home run.

SPORTS BRIEFS

”He sparked our offense,”
Mets batting coach Bill Robinson
said. ”We werein first place
when he got here, but we pulled
away when he got into the
lineup.”

Jefferies, 21, was named NL
Player of the Week for the peri-
od ending Sept. 11, when he was
1 1-for-25 with eight runs scored,
two doubles, one triple, three
homers and nine RBI.

The Mets clinched the NL East
at Shea Stadium on Sept. 22
against Philadelphia, but Jefferies
says he didn't really feel part of
the party.

’’I didn't feel completely part of
it because I haven't been here the
entire year,” Jefferies said. ”I feel
like they've accepted me. But
during the clincher I wasn't jump-
ing around with them and
celebrating.”

Hannan to Penguins
after fourth round

Hockey League in 1987-88.

The Penguins lost left wing
Dave Hunter to Winnipeg and
traded left wing Wayne Van Dorp
to Buffalo for future considera-
tions. Hunter, 30, was unprotect-
ed after the Penguins picked up
Hannon in the fourth round.

’’I believe we're a stronger
team now,” Penguins General

‘Manager, Tony Esposito said.

”We helped in a couple of areas.
We helped ourselves in the
center-ice area. And we also
helped in the physica|—toughness
area.”

Trinity coach faces
one year suspension

PITTSBURGH (AP) ——v The
PIAA Board of Control says Trini-
ty High School in Washington
cannot play any PIAA or WPIAL
opponents this season unless it
suspends girls’ basketball coach
Dave Johns for. one year.

The board decided that a sum-
mer recreation program involving
Trinity players violated Pennsyl-
vania Interscholastic Athletic As-
sociation rules that a team cannot
practice under its coach until
Nov. 21.

”There was concern that the
program was developing skills of
players,” said Russell T. Werner,
the PIAA’s executive director.

Johns, in his 14th season as
coach, said he would step down
to allow his team to play this sea-
son but said the matter hasn't
been closed.

”There’s a possibility we could
take this to court,” Johns said.

Trinity Athletic Director Jerry
Chambers said the school board

will decide Oct. 11 what action I

to take.

Johns ran a recreation program,
funded by school boosters, for
three days a week during the
summer.

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — Penn
State coach Joe Paterno ex-
pects to start freshman quarter-
back Tony Sacca for the
second consecutive week, but
he said Tuesday he still would
rather freshmen be ineligible
to play.

In his first start, Sacca led
Penn State to a 45-9 victory
over Temple at Veterans Stadi-
um, completing seven of 15
passes for 121 yards, two
touchdowns and one inter-
ception.

’’Overall, I think he did ex-
ceedingly well, but he has a
long way to go,” Paterno said
at his weekly news con-
ference.

”The fact that he could go
into that football game, play
before his home crowd, do
some things well and have the
team play well for him is a
good sign of the future,” Pater-
no said.

Paterno also said he would

continue to alternate tailbacks
Leroy Thompson, Gary Brown
and Sean Redman Saturday

when Penn State, 3-1, plays at
home against Cincinnati, 2-2,
Saturday.

Sacca, from Delran, N.J.,
was pressed into action two
weeks ago in Penn State's
21-16 loss to Rutgers when
starter Tom Bill suffered a dis-
located kneecap in the third
quanen

Second-stringer Lance
Lonergan has been out with a
thumb injury and must now
outplay Sacca in practice to
earn the quarterback job.

”|t’Il be a long shot that he
would be able to practice him-
self into a situation where he

V would be ready to do as well

as Sacca would be able to do
in this upcoming game, but
that remains to be seen,”
Paterno said.

Bill was expected to miss
three to five weeks of football
because of the injury, keeping
him benched until the Alaba-
ma game Oct. 22.

Paterno said he believes
Sacca is the first true freshman
to start at quarterback in his 23
years as head coach. Six other
freshmen play regularly but do
not start.

‘I3

PS U ’s Paterno would rather have
his freshmen sitting on the bench

Even with this freshmen
contingent, Paterno said he
would rather first-year players
be ineligible.

Injuries and depth at differ-
ent positions often dictate
which freshmen get to play,
Paterno said.

”I think it's difficult for those
youngsters to_come to grips
with the fact that they're not
playing and somebody else is
playing,” he said. ’’I think it's
a very disturbing time in their
lives.’’

Other Penn State freshmen

who have played regularly are A

flanker Donnie Bunch, wide
receiver O.J. McDuffie, nose
tackle Eric Renkey and defen-
sive backs Mark Graham,
Chris Cisar and Leonard Hum-
phries.

Asked about whether he
would pick a starting tailback,
Paterno said he did not think
one of his backs played better
than the others.

”I am having a tough time
sitting down and saying to my-
self, ‘This guy should be a
starting tailback ahead of the
other two,’ ” Paterno said.

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ The Pitts-
burgh Penguins reclaimed Dave
Hannan in the fourth round of the
National Hockey League waiver
draft, reacquiring a utility man
who played parts of seven sea-
sons in Pittsburgh.

”He can play left wing, right
wing, center, anywhere,” said
Coach Gene Ubriaco. ”He’s a
guy who will live and die for this
hockey team.”

Hannan, 26, is expected in uni-
form for the Penguins’ season
opener Friday night against the

Hannan scored four goals and
seven points in 21 games in Pitts-
burgh last season. He had nine
goals and 20 points in 51 games
with Edmonton, including his first
three—goa| game against the
Penguins.

The Penguins also picked
defenseman Steve Dykstra from
Edmonton and right wing Jay
Caulfield from Minnesota
Monday.

Dykstra scored one goal and
two points in 27 games with 91
penalty minutes at Buffalo last
season. In 15 games at Edmon-

Volleyball team thrived
with Hoover in control

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

When Pitt head volleyball
coach Shelton Collier left for
Seoul, South Korea on Sept. 15,
he left behind a young, relative-
ly inexperienced team to his as-
sistant, Sue Hoover.

The Lady Panthers were licking
their wounds, coming from tough
tournament losses to Pacific,
Brigham Young and Texas. Their

I record stood at 2-3.

Today, Collier returns to Pitt to
take over the coaching reins of a
13-3 team. In Hoover's head
coaching debut, the Lady Pan-
thers rallied around their young
coach and produced 11 straight
wins.

Although Pitt has not
challenged any national powers
in CoI|ier’s absence, they have

, played consistently, and the team

he is returning to is a much more
cohesive unit than the one he left.

Significantly, Hoover main-
tained an appreciable intensity
level on the team even when it
faced inferior opposition. The

Lady Panthers have swept all 11 -

of the matches under her tenure.

Pitt has been able to substitute
freely in most of its matches over
the last two weeks, and Hoover
has done a fine job keeping all
players on the team motivated
and ready to play.

The team has emerged from
Hoover's guidance with a posi-
tive frame of mind.

Freshman Dee MacAulay com-
mented, ”Sue really pushed us.
She did an awesome job. Addi-
tionally, we gained a lot of con-
fidence in ourselves because we
pushed ourselves.”

’’I think with Shelton gone and
Sue taking over, we gained a lot
of confidence in her ability as a
coach,” added Nancy Fiersch-
naller.

For some of the younger play-
ers, the opportunity for increased
playing under Hoover was a real
motivation for improvement.

”I thought Sue getting the
chance to coach was really good
for us. It was like preseason again
because we could improve as in-
dividuals; and then when Shelton
comes back, he can re-evaluate
us on our skills,” reflected Shel-
ly Seanor.

Bridget Gary thought that
Hoover's confidence in handling
the coaching assignment rubbed
off on the whole team.

”Sue took it upon herself to be
a real leader and, because of that,
we as a team were motivated to
improve. I'm sure Shelton will
notice the improvement we
made as a team," said Gary.

Hoover's coaching ability did
not go unobserved by veteran
players.

As junior Lori Silk noted,.”Sue‘

did a fine job. We went 11-0 with
her as a coach and accomplished
the goals we set out to accom-
plish. She was instrumental in
that occurring.” .

TORONTO — Ben Johnson,
stripped of his gold medal in
the 100-meter dash at the
Olympic Games in Seoul after
testing positive for steroids,
said Tuesday he has never
used drugs and vowed to be
back in the 1992 Olympic
Games.

”When I was a kid, I never
took drugs,” said Johnson,
reading from a prepared state-
ment at Toronto's Sutton Place
Hotel.

’’People who knew me in
Jamaica and people who
know me here know I
wouldn't take drugs. I have
never, ever knowingly taken
illegal drugs, and I would
never embarrass my family,
my friends, my country and
the kids who love me.

”My mother taught me that
there is only one way to win
— and I plan to come back —
still a champion and a winner
at the next Olympics.”

Reporters and cameramen
have been camped outside
Johnson's home since he
returned from Seoul a week
ago. He and his family have
scrapped with reporters seek-
ing his comments. In his state-
ment, Johnson, who declined
to take questions, asked the

‘ media to respect his privacy.

”Mv family and I need some

time and space. Please, please
grant us that.”

Johnson was accompanied
by his attorney, Ed Futerman,
who told the press conference
that the runner had never
given an interview to the West
German magazine, Stern,
which quoted Johnson as
screaming, ”I’l| pay back
whoever did this to me.”

Futerman said Johnson
”feels confused, very con-
fused. He’s trying to put the
pieces together.

”I think Ben is realistic
enough to say, ’I don't know.’
He's heard all the evidence —
he is confused now,” added
Futerman, 5 who said Johnson
plans to continue training.
”We're not denying the
presence of steroids. We're
not sure, we want to find out.”

Futerman said he was
pleased that the Canadian
government was conducting
its own investigation and said
he is looking into appealing to
the International Olympic
Committee and the Canadian
track association.

Asked about Johnson's com-
ments in Stern, Futerman said:
”I can only tell you that Ben
has assured me that he never
gave that interview last week.”

Futerman also denied
rumors that Johnson was con-
sidering a career in profession-

Johnson says he never used drugs,

expects to be back for '92 games

al football but admitted that
the controversy had damaged
the runner's marketability.

’’I know that some sponsors
have left him; I know that
others have stayed,” Futerman
said. I

Johnson's positive test
resulted in his being stripped
of the gold medal and of the
world record of 9.79 seconds
that he recorded in the race.
He was also given a two-year
suspension by the Internation-
al Amateur Athletic Fed-
eration.

In the Stern interview, John-
son reportedly said he might
never compete in the 100
again, an event in which he set
the world record of 9.83 in the
1987 World Championships
in Rome. _.

Stern published the inter-
view with the Canadian
sprinter in an issue released
three days ahead of its normal
Thursday distribution date.

”I’m finished. I'll probably
never run the 100-meter
again,” the magazine quoted
Johnson as saying.

Stern said Johnson made the
comments during_talks with
the sprinter at his sister's
Toronto home on Sept. 29.

Red Sox and Athletics prepare for

game amid threats of wind and rain

By Ben Walker

AP Baseball Writer

BOSTON — Boston's Bruce
Hurst and Oakland's Dave
Stewart might finally shine out-
side Roger Clemens’ shadow
since bad weather may put a
premium on pitching for the start
of the American League playoffs.

Chilly rain canceled part of the
Boston Red Sox workout Tues-

day, and the cool showers fore— _

cast for game one Wednesday
afternoon caused Oakland Athlet-
ics Manager Tony La Russa to
juggle his lineup.

Left fielder Dave Parker and se-
cond baseman Glenn Hubbard,
each slowed by nagging injuries,

were pulled from starting roles,
and Hubbard — troubled by a
pulled hamstring — was then
taken off the postseason roster.
Good-fielding, light-hitting Tony

Phillips and Mike Gallego will .

start in their places.

”Pitching and defense‘ are go-
ing to be more important,” La
Russa said. ’’If the conditions are
like they are today, you won't see
the Fenway Park of 10-9 games.”

For Hurst and Stewart, a low-
scoring game meant a chance at
deserved recognition. Hurst was
the true ace of the Boston staff
this year, and Stewart enjoyed his
second successive 20-victory sea-

son, although both are usually

dwarfed by Clemens’ big accom-
plishments. ,

Last year, Stewart complained
he should have won the Cy

Young instead of Clemens, but
few others agreed. This year,
Stewart went 21-12 with a 3.23
earned run average and Clemens
was 18-12 with a 2.93 ERA.

On Tuesday, Stewart down-
played the rivalry.

”There’s no comparison be-
tween myself and Roger Cle-
mens. I said what I said last year
and now it's over,” Stewart said.

’’I’m pitching the first game,”
he said. ”I’ve won my share of
games.”

Hurst, 18-6 with a 3.66 ERA,
was Manager Joe Morgan's pick
to start the opener because of his
effectiveness during the day at
Fenway Park. He went 13-2 at
home this year and is 5-1 lifetime
against the Athletics in Boston.

”You can put me in anyone’s
shadow you want,” Hurst said,
”but it's not a competition to see
who starts game one.

”Roger and I are definitely not
in competition. We're in compe-
tition for each other. He's a great
friend of mine.”

Clemens went to Morgan last

week and said he thought Hurst
should start game one.

”The competition is with the
A's, not with each other,” Cle-
mens said. ’’It’s not a big thing,
who pitches when.”

Clemens will start game two
against Storm Davis on Thursday
night. Boston's Mike Boddicker
opposes Bob Welch in game
three Saturday night in Oakland.

Stewart went 1-2 against
Boston this year, with both loss-
es coming in games against
Hurst. Stewart's lone victory was
a 1-0 decision over Clemens.
