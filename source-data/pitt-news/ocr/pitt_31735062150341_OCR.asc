Awardee

Versatile is the word for
Awardee Aldisert, on and off
campus politico, journalist,
good fellow.

Hailing from Carnegie, he
has overcome this disadvant-
age to pick off most of the
honors and a goodly share of
the tough jobs on campus.

With the completion of his
college career, Rugy hopes
to move up to the fourteenth

Sophomore Group Adds
Two Faculty Members

Fifteen freshman men and two fac-
ulty members were tapped to member-
ship in Druids, national honorary ac-
tivities fraternity for sophomore men,
during the ceremonies this morning at
Memorial hall.

Recognizing outstanding work of fresh-
man men in activities, scholarship, and
leadership, Druids has an active member-
ship of 19 each year: 15 tapped at Tap
day and four honored at the annual Druid
smoker for freshman men in the fall.

Aldo Icardi, C43, was named outstand-
ing sophomore man by a faculty commit-
tee. A member of the debate squad, he

Ritual

 

Even as the campus mourned the loss of
Dean Thrysa W. Amos, rarely has her in-
ﬂuence and contribution to student life
been more evident than at Tap day cere-
monies this morning.

As the, succession of honors progressed
today amid the significant symbolism of
inspired rituals, those witnessing the exer-
cises became increasingly conscious of the
lasting gifts Miss Amos had made to this
occasion.

There was the impressive ritual attend-
ant to announcement of the girl chosen by
her classmates to become their Queen, a
ceremony which Miss Amos had invested
with dignity and meaning.

There was the active participation of
Mortar Board, senior honorary which Dean
Amos had guided so faithfully since its
establishment on the Pitt campus in 1926.

There was Cwens, sophomore honorary
which Miss Amos had developed to replace
several loosely knit honorary organizations
in 1922 and which, under her leadership,
has expanded until Cwen chapters now
exist at 34 other schools throughout the
country,

There was the inspiration derived from
the symbolism of the Junior Worthies and
handing down of the Senior Spoon, cere-
monies which also owed their beginnings
in large part to the philosophy and leader-
ship of Miss Amos.

It was in 1922 that Miss Amos intro-
duced to the Pitt campus the ceremony of
the Senior Queen.

No undigniﬂed and superﬁcial honor is
that which has come to Pitt’s 16 queens.
Instead of choosing girls who qualify be-
cause of pulchritude or some intangible
popularity trait, Pitt’s queen is a symbol

Don’t let that red hair fool you. There’s
nothing tempermental about Mary Ruth
Hosey, new Senior Queen. Not only do
the Senior girls rate her tops; she stands
aces high with Pitt men and women in any
class.

While Senior Queen elections aren’t a
beauty contest, the Hosey girl does quite
all right in the looks department. She"
stands well up in the scholastic ratings,
does a ﬁrst class job in any activity she
takes a hand in, and all-in-all earns her
position as Pitt’s number one woman.

She’:; Senior Queen, but more than that,
she’s a swell girl.

The Spoon Dipped . . .

Oldest Tap day ceremony is the Dipping
of the Spoon, an event which grew out of
a disciplinary move. Back in. 1871, it
seems that the seniors were noisy in chapel,
and to them Chancellor Woods presented
a large wooden spoon, symbolic of spoon-
feeding, an activity usually restricted to
children.

The spoon, carved from a walnut tree
which had grown near the old brick Acad-
emy building at Third and Cherry, had
previously been kept for some time in a
cupboard in the Chancellor’s office. Why,
nobody seems to know.

At any rate, the seniors accepted it as
a badge of honor, and from then until
1923 the spoon was handed down every
year from the seniors to the juniors dur-
ing class day exercises. Each presentation
is commemorated on the spoon metal

plate, engraved with the numerals of both
classes participating.

-70’: In recent years the

‘ ceremony has been mark-
ed by the naming of
the fourteen most out-
standing junior men and
women as Junior Worthies
with one man and one
woman of the fourteen
being designated as Sen-
ior Worthies. Into their
official custody is given
the historic spoon.

 

The presentation of the spoon is made
by the two Senior Worthies of the pre-
vious year, in this case Adele Yorio and
Rugy Aldisert.

Succeeding Miss Yorio and Aldisert are,

two members of the class of 1942, Jean

     
 

Tap day forms lasting
memorial to Dean Amos

whereby in choosing one girl to receive the
crown, the members of the class not only
honor her as a person, but also honor in
her their own personal attainments.

Selected upon the basis of character, per-
sonality, scholastic achievement, success in
extra-curricular activity, and contribution
to life at the University, the Pitt queen
gains her honor by merit through a demo-
cratic process. This was the basic tenet
of Miss Amos’ ceremony.

Regarded throughout University circles
as one of the most beautiful and impressive
rituals in the country, the coronation cere-
monies which take place during com-
mencement week combine dignity, beauty,
and character. For months Miss Amos
made a thorough study of the actual cere-
mony of the British crowning and the cam-
pus coronation bears an impressively sim-
ilar pattern.

The Pitt chapter of Mortar Board is rec-
ognized as one of the strongest units in that
organization’s nation-wide membership.
Several times members of the Pitt chapter
have served in national office, and through
the efforts of Miss Amos the society has
established a position of preeminence
among campus honoraries for women.

When the 26 freshman girls were tapped
this morning to Cwens, they marked the
nineteenth class which had membership in
this organization. It was in 1922 that Miss
Amos undertook the establishment of an
honorary for sophomore women that would
combine an effective program with tradi-
tion and high standards. To do this it
was necessary to replace several moribund
societies which existed and mould them
into the organization which today claims
more than 700 members throughout the
country.

 

Five feet of personality-plus describes
peppy Adele Yorio, Alma Mater for 1941.
The biggest little woman in her class,
Adele’s lively chatter and dynamic brunette
beauty make even the most ardent Pitt
patriot look less harshly on the ﬁrst half
of the Rome-Berlin axis.

Athlete, dancer, blu-es singer, and honor
student, the Peabody half-pint is every-
body’s pal. People like her because she
likes people. And when there’s work to
be done, she’s always around to help out.

Wherever she goes and whatever she
does, she makes people sit up and take
notice. She’s got something there.

. . . to These Junior Worthies

Brink and Jack Stauff. Miss Brink, past
president of Cwens, will handle the desti-
nies of WSGA for the coming year, while
reﬂecting glory on the Tri-Delt house.
Stauﬁ will continue as editor of the
Panther, act as Delt prexy, and have an-
other go at SFA.

In addition to Miss Brink, women Junior
Worthies are Bernadette Blatt, Mildred
Frobouck, Elisabeth Foster, Charlotte Har-
ris, Harriet Harris, and Georgia Shuset.
Miss Blatt will assist Miss Brink as WSGA
vice-president. Miss Frobouck, in addition
to being a Kappa, will be busy with WSGA
work. Another Kappa, Miss Foster will
be chief justice of Senior court.

the country.

That organization became known as
Cwens, national honorary activities frater-
nity for sophomore women.

This morning Cwens tapped 26 freshman

Lords of the Press- . . 1941-1942

wl, Panther Heads

1 ‘F133’ BOB MACHESNEY

No prosaic, temporary, piddling ac-
ivity is the production of the three
mdergraduate publications . . . Pitt
News, Pitt Panther, and Owl.

 Six thousand students and faculty

, on them for timely information, sidelights

on University life, records of campus per-
sonalities and events. -

To produce them more than 250 stu-
dents work from September to June, go
without lunches, munch cold sandwiches

for dinner, spend long hours amid the din
an.d turbulance of printing plants, often
walk down eight ﬂoors of the Cathedral
when the elevators stop at midnight.

Chief positions on these publications are
those of editor and business manager, and
prominent among the Tap day ceremonies
this morning was announcement of those
who will have these jobs next year.

Biggest publication on campus is the
News with a minimum of 456 inches of
space to be ﬁlled with type 85 times a
year. Selected to head this activity next
year was Jack deBenedictis, C42. Because
his activity has been largely conﬁned to
the News, deBenedictis is not well known
beyond the eighth floor. There he is re-
garded for his unconventional dress, his
fondness for argument, his consistent work.
During the present year, much that has
appeared on the editorial page of the News
has been his. His editorials have been
full of quotable passages, and his columns
with Oscar Sheﬂer have been both vague
and clever.

He began at Carnegie Tech where he
had the idea that he wanted to be an
aeronautical engineer, but h-e soon learned
that he liked sonnets better than wing-
struts so last year he moved across the
hollow to Pitt. Here he is an English
major.

He lives in Mt. Lebanon where he went
to high school. He believes in being com-
fortable, thinks that stiff shoes, neck-ties,
and suits are the invention of advertising
hokum. Consequently, he is often seen
in beach shoes, open-shirt, and sweater,
but despite such Bohemian habits he knows
the batting average of Joe Medwick and
the intricacies of the ﬂuid drive. He
doesn’t like hair-cuts, but he enjoys James
Joyce, Zane Grey, cowboy ballads, pump-
kin pie, and Lana Turner.

To pay for those 85 issues of the News,
there must be advertising. The Univer-
sity contributes about 20 per cent of the
total cost of publishing the paper. This
amounts to about 48 cents a student a year.
The remainder of the expense must be
met from merchants who use the columns
to shout their wares.

Selected to head the business staff is
quiet, unassuming, but persistent and effi-
cient Julian Silverman, BA42. Having
served as comptroller of the News this
year, Silverman can recite printing costs,
advertising commissions, over-time charges,
proﬁt and loss ﬁgures with as much ease
as he customarily goes through his ac-
counting classes.

He is as meticulous about his appearance
as he is in adding a row of ﬁgures. Ex-
cept for a weakness for dazzling sport
jackets, he follows the same policy of con-
servatism as a bank executive. As though
the ﬁscal problems of the News were not
enough, he served a term as exchequer of
Pi Lambda Phi where, despite such an
unfortunate situation, he emerged as
popular as ever. He lives in Pittsburgh
and was graduated from Taylor Allderdice
High school.

Biggest change in undergraduate publi-
cations was noted this year in the Panther
under editor Jack Stauff. From a maga-
zine devoted largely to humor and human
interest accounts, the Panther began to
run pictures of Tuck shop loungers, cam-
pus political bigwigs, and boy meeting girl
at the Junior prom, to become a camera
record of the lighter side of college life.

In recognition of the enterprise shown
by the Panther this year, the Publications
board today announced the reappointment
of Stauff as editor for next school term.

Known as one of the most active men
on campus since the day two years ago
when he led a group of slap-happy ballad

The Hall

0 By Oscar Sheﬂer

On at least one list of awards there seems to be
room for everyone deserving of merit.

Twenty people—-ten men and ten women——have
been chosen by the Owl for its Hall of Fame. Se-
lected by a committee of juniors, they are preserved
for posterity in a special word and picture section
of the Owl.

The-se are the people. They have been chosen by
their fellow underclassmates. The selection must
have been easy,_in that those who are there belong
there; it must have been difficult, in that it was
necessary to omit many names which might have be-
longed.

The women. :

As vice president of WSGA, Nadine Dean this year
supervised the activities of all the freshman women’s
units. She is a member of Mortar Board.

Cheerful, congenial Betty Dils is president of
Panhellenic council. An Owl staff worker, she is
also a member of Zeta T" 1.1 Alpha, women’s social
fraternity, and of Mortar "A oard.

Gertrude Forman is a member of Senior court,
Pitt Players, and Mortar Board.

Patrician, digniﬁed Harriett Glasser this year
served as chief justice of senior court. She is a
Theta and a Mortar Board.

This year’s senior‘ queen, Mary Ruth Hosey,‘ as a
member of Theta Phi Alpha has walked off with all

the senior awards offered by that fraternity. One
of three winners of Panhellenic scholarships, she
presides over WSGA and belongs to Mortar Board.

Betty MacQueen is president of YWCA, a staff
worker on the Owl, and a member of Mortar Board
and Beta Sigma Omicron, social fraternity for wo-
men.

President of Mortar Board, to which nine of the
ten women in the Hall of Fame belong, is Gene Pyle,
Kappa, Panther contributor, and secretary of SFA.

Best remembered for her uniformed apearances
during the football season with the band as coed
captain of that organization, Tri-Delt Betty Toddie
chairmanned WSGA’s open house parties.

Tri-Delt Hulda Tully is a member of senior court,
Pitt Players, and Mortar Board.

Some years ago, Adele Yorio took an extra step
and an extra breath. She has never stopped since
to catch up with either. She is president of Women’s
Athletic association and a member of Mortar Board,
with a three point blueprint on her last time up.
As Senior Worthy at last year’s ceremonies, she
bore the downslanted end of the Junior Spoon.

The men:

Ruggero Aldisert, as editor of the News, is top
man in the busiest activity on campus. As president
of ODK, heis head of the highest-rated honorary on
campus. He is competent and business-like. At
last year’s Tap day ceremonies he was named Senior
Worthy and entrusted with the care of the Junior
Spoon. Under his reign the News, for the first time
in its history, received All-American rating from
Associated Collegiate press.

Baby-faced, soft spoken, ‘Cortland B. Bacall is a
member of ODK, business manager of the News. He
is first-lieutenant of Scabbard and Blade, national
honorary m_ilitary society.

Under the business managership of Alvin Gross,
ODKer and Pilam, the Panther this year enjoyed
one of its most successful seasons, from a ﬁnancial
standpoint.

Selwyn J. Loeb is business manager for this year’s
Owl. He is past president of the Pi Lambda Phi
house, and a member of Scabbard and Blade and
ODK.

Outstanding for athletic participation, Thaddeus
Konetsky was captain of last year’s football team
and a weight—man on the track squad. He presides
over the freshman class of the Dental school and is
a member of Kappa Sigma, social fraternity.

Staggering under a heavy load of activities keys,
SFAer \Villiam McElwain is president of Pitt Players,
sports editor of the News, constant contributor to the
Panther, and a member of ODK and Quill club. His
is the most free and natural writing style of any
publications man.

Joseph L. Roberts wears an ODK key. He was
president of SFA and, at one time, president of the
Phi Gam house.

Fred Robie, ﬁnger-pointing debater, is president
of the newly-formed independent association. Hav-
ing assumed, more so than any other undergraduate
man, the role which Jack Hoeveler last year aban-
doned in the Independent party, Robie dates stead-
ily with a fraternity girl. He is ODK, on SFA’s ex-
ecutive committee and is manager of the debate team.

Robert Shaw is president of YMCA, and a mem-
ber of Scabbard and Blade, ODK, and Delta Tau
Delta. ‘

As editor of this year's Owl, Delt William Sheris,
with the theme “You,” continued the precedent of in-
formality-established last year under editor Richarde
Weiss.

Get Reward

For Service

For outstanding services to their
fraternities, to the fraternity sys-
tem, and to the University, Edgar
Cook, Al Holbrook, Robert Jones,

,Richard Kay, and Alvin Ludwig

received Interfraternity council
awards at today’s Tap day ex-
ercise.

Thes-e ﬁve men, according to
Dean of Men Vincent W. Lanfear,
Theodore Biddle, and Robert C.
Corley, who made the selections
upon recommendations of under-
graduates, are the ﬁve senior fra-
ternity men who have done the
most for the fraternities system
at Pitt.

Edgar Cook, Pi Kappa Alpha,
was to a large extent responsible
for the pre—rush week events of
last fall. These events, which in-
cluded :1 style show, were held by
fraternities to acquaint newcom-
era of the values of fraternity life.
The two or three day program may
become an annual forerunner of
rushing.

Al I-Iolbrook, Phi Gamma Delta,
was ou'.sta.nding in IF council
work, in intramural athletics, and
as treasurer of his house.

Robert Jones, Delta Tau Delta,
has been president of his house,
active in fraternity projects, and
in IF council.

Richard Kay, Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon, is president in his house,
and received the plaque for out-‘
standing service to his house.

Alvin Ludwig, Theta Chi, was
president of IF council and of his
house. According to the selectors,
he did an outstanding job in both
capacities.

‘This is the second year that the
council plaques have been given.
Last year’s awards went to Wil-
liam J. Edmunds Jr., Phi Gamma
Delta; Henry DeRocher, Pi Kappa
Alpha; James Kennedy, Delta Tau
Delta; Richarde Weiss, Pi Lambda
Phi; and Walter White, Sigma Chi.

To head the business staff of the
Panther the Publications board
placed the stamp of approval on
Edward Tait, who hai-s from In-
diana, Pa. Tait came to the Panth-
staff last fall as advertising assist-
ant to Dave Tucker. He went aft-
er some big accounts with a de-
termined persistence that belied
his calm demeanor.

Because of his work as Univer-
sity marshal, he has established a
wide acquaintanceship throughout
the school.

He had his start as advertising
solicitor by selling space in pro-
grams for firemens’ carnivals back
in his home town.

Less spectacular than either the
News or the Panther is the. Owl
which makes it belated appear-
ance near the close of school. Al-
though it cuts less of a ﬁgure in
campus affairs than the rival pub-
lications, work on the Owl is just
as exacting and prolonged as on
the latter activities.

To servie as idea man, which is
the lot of any Owl editor, the Pub-
lications Board chose John Brosky,
BA42, who has put in three years
on the Owl editorial staﬁ. In pre-
paring the 1941 Owl, he served as
lay-out editor and editorial assist-
ant. ‘

Teaming up with Brosky next
year will be Thomas Westermann,
C42, who has been named business
manager. Westermann has had
only one year of service on the
Owlgbut he exhibited enough en-
terprise and aggressiveness to win
the support of the board for the
position. He is active in the band,
Pitt Riﬂes, and SFA, and serves
as assistant in the cooperative
buying office, when not chasing
ads or commuting to Carnegie
where both he and Brosky live.
(Ruggero Aldisert, this year’s
editor of the Pitt News also claims
Carnegie as his home.)

Westermann is tall, walks ener-
getically, talks with a fast clip,
and could probably be a favorite
among ‘Tuck shop society, if he
could take the time from chasing
ad copy.

Greeks Battle for Trophies
Today at Sweepstakes Race

Custom built pushmobiles from
10 fraternity houses will approach
the starting line today at 3
o’clock to race for Spring Festi-
val’s annual sweepstakes trophy.

Competition, this year, is ex-
pected to be keener than ever be-
fore as more cars, newer models,
and more experienced competitors
will help make the race close.

Like last year’s race, today’s
meet will be decided on time
trials. The race will again start
in front of University place near
Physicians building and continue
up Lytton avenue, around the cor-
ner to Bigelow boulevard, around

the “suicide corner,” and on to
the ﬁnisn line at Thaw Hall.

Phi Gamma Delta’s strong crew
of pushers will be out to retain
their previous year’s crown, and
should be named one of the favor-
ites. They will have their veteran
squad back to guide them to an-
other cup. Bill Colvin is slated to
drive the car, with Earl Pressel,
Dick Mansﬁeld, Paul MacNeil,

Howard Uptegraﬂc‘,
Thurbon serving in the capacity
of pushers. _~
Delta Tau Delta will be show-
ing off their new, streamlined,

three-wheel car today with little '

Bill Beerbower piloting. Jim
Klein, Johnny Stahl, Bill Beng-
hauser, Henry Loutzenhiser, and

Bill Newbury will be the pushers
for the Delts.

Pi Kappa Alpha will also go
to the starting line as one of the
pre-race favorites. Their car will

have Frank Mateer in the driv— "

er’s seat. The Wilde brothers,
Page, Carlson, and Anderson will
supply the man power.

In the first heat of the day’s
races, Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Chi,
and Phi Kappa will try to outdo
each other. The second heat will
match Phi Gamma Delta, Pi
Lambda Phi, and Sigma Alpha
Mu. Sigma Alpha Epsilon and
Pi Kappa Alpha go in the third
heat, and in the ﬁnal race the
Delts will match the Theta Chi
squad. “

and Bobby ,

Neil, and Bitner received honor
on the all-intramural touch foot-
ball team during the past cam-
paign.

Last year’s track meet saw the
Fijis walk away with the crown
by scoring 23 more points than
their closest rivals, Kappa Sigma
and Phi Delta Theta. In the

‘ sweepstakes, the car driven by Bill

Colvin nipped the fast Delta Tau
Delta car by seconds to chalk up

another first place for the high-
ﬂying Fijis.

Speedball was closely contested
throughout the season, and at the
conclusion of the league race, the
Phi Garn squad beat out the Pi
Kappa Alpha team by a scant one
point.

Phi Delta Theta showed a
unique record this year, failing to
win a single first place event, but
piled up enough runners-up points
to place second in the ﬁnal stand-
ings.

At the third place post, the Del-
ta Tau Delta team tied with the
Pi Kappa Alpha squad with 4191/2
points. The PiKA’s scored their
points by winning the annual in-
terfraternity sing, and horseshoes,
and taking second place points in
volleyball and tennis.

The Delts came through again
with their annual table tennis
cup, a second in the sweepstakes,
and a third in track, golf, and.‘ the
interfraternity sing.

Local Linksmen Play Underdog Role
In EIGA Matches Today, Tomorrow

Pitt makes another bid this aft-
ernoon and tomorrow for recogni-
tion in the Eastern Intercollegiate
Golf association round-robin
tournament. But despite consid-
erable improvement over last
year’s league doormats, the Panth-
ers aren’t likely to be there when
the awards are passed out.

Defending champion George-
town is again the team to beat in
the forthcoming matches at Penn
State. The Hoyas have already
defeated Penn and Princeton, and,
according to Coach Tony Sylves-
ter, the Tigers were the toughest
opponent on the Georgetown
schedule.

Bolstered by the sudden splurge
of Bob Walkinshaw and Jack
Glenn and the reliable stroking of
Bill Kramer and Harry Simpson,
Pitt may beat Penn, may make
trouble for Princeton, probably

won’t have a chance against
Georgetown. The Hoyas shoot
in the low 70’s and the Panthers
don’t.

Brightest hopes for Pitt lie in
scoring a few surprises in the
lower half of the lineup. Jack
Glenn’s two thrilling wins in
EIGA play and Bob Walkinshaw’s
Cornell triumph provide a ray of
hope.

Probable lineup for Pitt will be
Bill Kramer, Bob Seybold, Harry
Simpson, Jack Glenn, Bob Wal-
kinshaw, and Bob Jones.

Indiana Trackers May Prove

Too Strong for

For the first time in four years
the University of Pittsburgh track
team will enter a dual meet as
the underdog when they face the
Indiana squad at Lafayette tomor-
row afternoon. Unpatriotic as it
may be, the News prognosticator
also sees defeat for the Panthers
by a 71-60 score.

Chief reason for the choice of
the Hoosiers is t.he presence of
Campbell Kane, Roy Cochrane,
Wayne Tolliver, Archie Harris
and others of Penn Relays fame
on the Indiana team. Kane, Coch-
rane, Tolliver, and a fourth man,
Paul Kendall, came close to set-
ting world’s records in the Phila-
delphia event; they should have
little trouble in the middle dis-
tance events tomorrow.

Blue and Gold.

Only hope for the Panthers lies
in surprise performances by some
of their more inconsistent athletes.
Dave McDowell’s return to form
in the high jump would help
make the meet closer. Hap Stickel
also holds a key to the situation in
his very unpredictable legs. He
may be withheld from the sprints
again and only run the low
hurdles.

The Pitt mile relay team might
also change the complexion of the
meet by a sudden improvement.
Regis Larkin, Bud Graf, Larry
Tregoning, and Del Anderson beat
Indiana last year, but the im-
portant Cochran didn’t run. Should
Cochran be held out this year for
the broad jump, the Pitt foursome
has a chance.

season, and had the Panthers
beaten, 5-2, before blowing up in
the seventh inning last Saturday.

tory, Pitt’s racquetmeri will at-
tempt to add another victory to an
already enviable record of wins
when they meet Indiana State
