CGS/PPC Agree -

A recent agreement between
the Pitt Programming Council
and the Student Government
Council will allow evening stu-

dents to "attend PPC events
under, the same conditions as
full-time CAS students.

Part of the agreement calls for
the transfer of $10,800 from the
SGC lncome Account into the
PPC operating account. This
reverses a move in l980, when
SGC ruled that all College of
General Studies student activi-
ties fees be deposited directly
into CGS student government
accounts. The move away from
joint participation with CAS
arose over SGB’s plan to hike
CAS student activities fees by
100 percent.

Observatory Open

Allegheny Observatory is
sponsoring an open house on
Friday, Sept. 4, at 7:00 p.m. lt is
the only time during the year
when the general public can look
through all three of the observa-
tory’s telescopes. *

Of the three telescopes, the‘
“Thaw” is the fifth largest refrac-
tor in the world, and the largest
photographic telescope in the
country. Another, 21 I3-inch
refractor, was purchased by
Pittsburgh businessmen in l86l.

The open house‘ is free, but res-
ervations are necessary. For free
tickets, and more information,

Dean Proposes  
Plan To Ease
Advising Woes

By MARY KANE

Editor

Because future engineers, phar-
macists and educators are served by
the College of Arts and Sciences
advising center, shouldn’t the pro-
fessional schools that benefit from
these services help pay for them?

That‘s the question being posed
by CAS Dean lrwin Schulman as a
consequence of cuts in the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences budget.

Last year, FAS was forced to trim
$850,000 from its budget as part ofa
university-wide tax on all academic
departments. This meant that the
advising center had to eliminate
seven positions. _

Schulman proposedtto Chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar this summer that
some of the costs of operating the
advising center could be met by the
schools that benefit from it.

“The advising center provides
advising for students going into pre-
professional programs,” Schulman
said. “And it has employed advisers
from the professional schools. Basi-
cally, we’re maintaining that the
professional schools served by the
advising center help to augment its
budget.”

Smith has seen the proposal but
declined to comment. The decision
on the proposal rests with the pro-
vost because the FAS and the advis-
ing center are within hisjurisdiction.

However, because the proposal

has budgetary implications, Senior

And that, according to Jack
Freeman, senior vice chancellor

to rush about.

“There have been a couple of
studies about fraternity housing

years,” he said. “But they always
‘failed because we couldn’t figure
out a way to fund them.”

Now that a funding plan has
been worked out between Pitt
and the fraternities who have

Pitt’s View From the Lake  

By SCOT STONE '

News Editor

In the future, Lakeview will be a
word that excites fear in some and
hope in others. It is the name of the
West Virginia site where, in July,
over I20 members of Pitt's academic
community met to discuss the many
new problems in planning that will
face the university in the near future.

inadequate state funding, inﬂa-
tion, the dcmand for new programs
from already tight budgets and an
expected 30 percent falloff in the
college-age population in Pennsyl-

. ,yania_,. are factors tha_t have come

together to make the administration
of an institution the size of Pitt a
near nightmare. ‘
All of this, taken together, will
mean severe cuts at some future
date. The goal of the planning con-
ference, according to Jack Freeman,
Pitt’s senior vice chancellor for
administration, is to develop a pro-
cess that would supplant the old
planning procedure and point
toward areas where cuts could best
be made without damaging the aca-
demic quality of the university.
What is unique about the Lake-
view sessions, when compared to the

old Sys.t,cm,, is the,ams>.unt o,f.m.id-.

PhtBonds

In Market

Three university projects
being funded inipart by the C
Allegheny County Higher Edu-
cation Assistance Authority,
may be facing a possible post-
ponement in construction,’
according to Jack Freeman,
senior vice chancellor for
administration.

Because of what he described
as a “limited market for munici— '
pal bonds,” the type of tax-free
bonds Pitt would obtain through ;
the authority may incur too high
of a debt for the university to
afford. .

When plans were made for the
pr.ojects—the Student Union
renovations-,~ construction of a
business school building and a

fraternity houising complex— 1 if

Pitt anticipated a debt of l2 per-
cent on the bonds. Now,
Freeman said, these bonds are up .
to between l4 and 15 percent.
“We think that if we had to go
to the bond market right now, we
probably couldn’t afford to do it. «
Youjust can’t afford to take on
40 years of bonds at l6 percent.
It’s just too much,” Freeman
said. '
Freeman said the university
may be able to secure temporary

Virginia was composed of depart-

According to Freeman, the direc-
tion of any planning program
should come from the central
administration; however, because

the complexity of problems that face

the university is so large and wide-
ranging in their impact, it is neces-
sary to get advice from the people
most directly involved: the depart-
ment heads and the deans.

Student Organizations Find Quarters

Pitt’s student organizations have
a new home for the next l8 months
or so-—the old recreation room in
the Student Union. The majority of
the organizations will be housed
there until most ofthe Schenley Hall
renovations are completed.

The groups “offices" are geomet-
rically arranged and the only thing
that sets the different organizations
apart are yellow dots on the floor
and little signs distinguishing all of
the groups. The exception is the Stu-

dent Government committees, who
have their own offices partitioned
off from the rest of the room.

This lack of space means that the
Young Democrats‘ office is next to
the Young Republicans and only fil-
ing cabinets separate the Pitt Choral
Club and Auto Racing Team.

Members of various organiza-
tions view the temporary location as
being the price to pay for progress.
They accept the fact of where they

are, and are trying to do the best they
can.

One person commented that now
he doesn't have to fight the elevators
in Schenley Hall.

Some groups have lost members
because of the move, but the active
members are accepting the move
and actually look foward to sharing
the space with others. They said it’s a
great chance to meet fellow students
with different interests.

Plans for a hotel-and-
condominium complex surfaced last
January, when reports were pub-
lished that Beynon Land Co., a sub-
sidiary of Beynon & Co. Realtors,
was planning to develop the 3~acre
site for the complex. _

Beynon obtained 99-year leases
on the property, which includes two
parking lots. The Syria Mosque lot‘
is located between Bigelow Boule-‘
vard and Bayard and Lytton streets.
The Masonic Temple lot is sur-
rounded by Bayard and Tennyson
streets and is separated from the
Syria Mosque lot by Lytton Street.

Despite the opposition from the
Schenley Farms residents, Beynon

has already committed itself to com--

pletion of the project.

“What we’re saying is there’s every
intention to build a facility there,”
said Edward Smuts, project man-
ager. “We’ll be meeting with the
community people if they want to
meet, with the city to get their input,
and at the same time we‘ll be design-
ing and working on the final finan-
cial package."

While Smuts declined to reveal
any specifics of the project pending
the completion of feasibility studies,
he said groundbreaking could come
as early as next year. Smuts said the
feasibility studies detailing the costs,
size and design of the complex
would be completed within the next
two to three weeks.

Pitt’s position is that some sort of
hotel besides the Howard Johnson’s
on the Boulevard of the Allies and
the University lnn on Forbes
Avenue should be built in Oakland.

“We have always maintained that
there is a pressing need for a first-
class hotel in the Oakland area,"said
Jack Freeman, senior vice chancel-
lor for administration. “The health
center needs it, Carnegie-Mellon
University needs it. lt’s very incon-
venient to have to go downtown for
anything-you want to do."

With this sort of commitment
from the university, Hague is not
surprised that they would want to
see the hotel built. He believes Pitt

’may be one of the primary_non—
financial principals in e roject.

 

 

“its not beyond the possibility
that Pitt is the major backer to
attract investors," he said. “Other-
wise they can't justify the project”to
investors.

When asked ifhe thought Pitt was
a good neighbor, Hague responded
with a firm “No!" He questioned
how the university could justify all
of its expansion in the face ofdeclin-
ing student enrollment.

“A lot of university administra-
tors feel they have to be constantly
building in order to show that they
are a progressive administration,"
he said.

Smuts, however, feels Hague and
the civic association are overreact-
ing to the proposed hotel. Citing “a
big problem of communication,"
Smuts said that despite attempts to
get the civic association to meet with
the developer to discuss specifics of
the complex, the association has
refused the invitation.

“We’ve said to the city and to
them (the Schenley Farms residents)
that we'll sit down any time and dis-
cuss our concerns and suggestions
and design ideas. The community
groupjust doesn’t seem to want to sit
down and talk about specifics.
They’re afraid they’ll compromise
their position, but l just don‘t agree
with that approach,” Smuts said.

Hague’s group has served Pitts-
burgh Mayor Richard Caliguiri with
a l22—signature petition that urges
the mayor to take a public position
opposing the complex. When the
petition was served, Hague said he
was told the mayor wouldn’t take a
position until he received more
information.

“We feel the mayor has enough
information to take a position,"
Hague said.

Smuts said market studies, the
result of interviews with people at
Pitt, CMU and local businesses,
concluded that there would be a
need for the hotel for conference
purposes. “The basic philosophy is
that there’s a need for it there, and
the location that has been focused
on seems to be strategically located
to serve those needs.”

Vice Chancellor for administration
Jack Freeman has also seen it.

He said he thinks a better solution
to the center‘s funding problem
might be to have the professional
schools appoint their own advisers
out of their own budgets to advise
students planning to attend their
schools.

“I would not like to transfer
money from the School of Educa-
tion to the advising center, but l
would prefer for the School of Edu-
cation to name someone to work in
the advising center," Freeman said.

He added that the provost and the
deans of the schools involved will
meet to sort out the details of the
proposal.

At least one school has come up
with its own solution to the advising
problem.

Lewis Dittert, dean of Pitt’s
School of Pharmacy, said his school
is changing its admissions process
and may be providing its own
advising.

“lt’s difficult for the CAS advisers
to keep up with the changes in our
programs,” Dittert said. “We may be
doing pre-pharmacy advising our-
selves. But we’ll have to see how our
new system works."

William Rudoy. associate dean of
the School of Engineering, said he
hasn’t been contacted yet about the
proposal and had no comment.

School of Education Dean James
Kelly was unavailable for comment.

Wine tasting, personal finance
and traveling tips are just a few of
the courses offered this fall by Pitt‘s
lnformal- Program (PIP).

The university-related program
runs personal and leisure learning-
type classes. Kim Fleming, who is
with the program, said Pll’ gets no
university support and in fact, the
program directors have to pay Pitt
for cost overhead. But it does fall
under the jurisdiction of the pro-
vost’s office.

Most of the classes begin the week
of September 2| and the fees of the
classes run anywhere between $l5
and $55 depending on the class.

The classes are taught by Pitt
faculty and faculty from other uni-
versities in Pittsburgh. There are
also classes taught by members of
the community. Most classes are
held on campus, but there are a few
that are held off campus.

 

Lake

conference was the establishment of

a joint-curriculum committee by 1

Nathan Stark, senior vice chancellor
for the health sciences.

According to Robert Hickey,
assistant senior vice chancellor for
academic planning, the committee
functions as a forum for gathering
ideas on ways to “provide the best
possible curriculum without spend-
ing any additional money."

Some of the methods Hickey sees
as viable are the improved schedul-
ing ofclasses, more interdisciplinary
merging and joint appointments for
faculty that can offer learning
opportunities to related fields.

“The value of an orthopedic sur-
geon talking to physical therapy stu-
dents is obvious," Hickey said. “So
why not give a person like that a dual
appointment?"

Hickey sees one alternative, larger
class sizes, as “not a problem at all.”
He points out that most medical stu-
dents spend their first two years of
instruction in large lecture hall
situations. "

In addition to the familiarity with
large class sizes, there are several
other factors that may make the
health sciences the ideal testing
ground for the conclusions of the
Lakeview conference. One is the

at

basic relatedness of the various
health sciences themselves. Accord-
ing to Hickey. they all stem from
biology. so there are certain basic
facts that everyone has to learn.
Also, these same basic facts form a
kind of language that makes com-
munication easier between, for
example, an M.D. and a dentist.
At this point, there are no specific
plans to expand the joint-
curriculum model throughout the
university, but Provost and Senior
Vice Chancellor Rhoten Smith said
that what is needed is “better curric-
ulum management.” To accomplish
this goal, Smith plans to examine

each department on an individual
basis with an emphasis on
selectiveness.

“We have no specific plans to
make cuts at this point," Smith said.
“We have to be‘ very selective about
this.” *

Pitt News Stall Writer

‘First it was suposed to be
housed in Mervis Hall. Then,
when that proved too costly,
Pitt's Graduate School of Busi-
ness was going to stay- where it is
now, in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. But when Pitt administra-
tors discovered that renovations
in the cathedral would have
added up to $67 per square foot,
that plan was also scrapped.‘

Today, the business school
thinks it has finally found a home
in a $6-6.5 million t_hree—story
building to be located in the

_ vacant lot surrounded by Bou-

quet and Joncaire streets and

- Roberto Clemente Drive. The

site contains the last remaining
portion of the old Forbes Field
outfield wall.

The plight of the business
school to find enough space for
its expanding enrollment started
about six years ago. Plans to ren-
ovate Mervis Hall and put the
schoolthere fellthrough afterthe
state decided not to fund the pro-
ject. Then, the school was going
to’ stay ‘within the cathedral,
while other departments would
have been relocated to make

.5‘

room for the school.

“We actually got about half
way into that project by moving
some things over to Mervis
Hall,” said Jack Freeman, senior

vice chancellor for administra-"

tion. “But as we got into the plan-
ning of it, it was clear .that
making “those kinds of renova-
tions that would be necessary in
this building (Cathedral of
Learning) werejust highly ineffi-
cient because of the small size of
the floor and the high cost of
conversion."

So, Freeman explained, for no
more than what it would have
cost to renovate space in the
cathedral, a new building could
be constructed, while at the same
time “solving for a long, long
time a basic space problem.”

Freeman estimated that about
75,000 square feet in the cathed-
ral. space now occupied by the
business school, will be allocated
to other departments.

Pitt‘s latest plans call for a rec-
tangular building, constructed
with pre-engineered parts.
Reflective glass will be used on
the exterior ofthe building, Free-
man said, to reflect the disparate
styles of architecture (Forbes
Quad‘rangle, Frick Fine Arts

F rats

Freeman said reports of a
completion date of September

i982 were “rather ambitious.”

He said January 1983 was a more
likely date. a

The Pittsburgh architectural
firm of Liff, Chetlin & Associates
was selected last month out a
field of IO firms to design the
complex. The firm’ is now in the
finishing stages of designing a
student union gym on Pitt’s
Titusville c'ampus.

The architects proposed a.

“kind of townhouse design,”
Freeman said, with intercon-
nected walls yet separate entran-
ces and “identities.”

Marin Chetlin, of the Liff
firm,_refused to comment on spe-
cific design plans pending a

 

meeting with Pitt Chancellor
Wesley Posvar today, when Pos-
var will give his ideas on possible
designs.
So far, letters of intent have
been received by l0 fraternities,
according to Lou McLinden,
assistant director of student
activities: Sigma Chi, Theta Chi,
Zeta Beta‘Tau,,Delta Tau Delta,
Phi Kappa‘ Theta, Pi Kappa
Alpha, Sigma ‘Alpha ‘Epsilon,
Delta Phi, Delta Sigma Delta (a
dental fraternity) and, contin-
gent on their establishing a chap-
ter here, Sima Alpha Mu.
Plans originally included
space for only eight fraternities,
so". space will be awarded on a
first-come,.. first-served basis,
Freeman said. ‘

Building and homes along Bou-
quet Street) surrounding the bus-
iness school building. A

While the state's General Ser-
vices Administration approved
in July the transfer of l .7 acres of
state-owned land for the business
school building, the building still
must begapproved by the City
Planning Commission and City
Council before construction can
begin.

Pitt plans to finance the pro-

ject with the help of the Allegh-i

eny County Higher Education
Assistance Authority, a financ-
ing organization approved by the
county last February. When the
authority is formally approved
by the Secretary ofthe Common-
wealth, it will allow Pitt to obtain
tax-free bonds for construction
projects such as the business
school.

“Quite frankly, we never antic-
ipated that kind of interest,” he
said. “We thought we might get
five or six fraternities who would
be sufficiently interested to ante
up $100,000” for their share of
the construction costs.

One option being considered is
to build two or three additional
houses on University Drive
below the original complex.

“We’re examining that to see.

0

whether that’s cost-effective,’
Freeman said.

Freeman said security for the
complex, while not as tight as in
the dormitories, will be the same
as for “other parts of the univer-
sity.” He said the university may
hire a security officer to patrol
the area.

Dear Abby:

Of course ‘no man is an island ’——there’s always some-
one there to tell you how to live.

-(111011.

Everything is going up: tuition, rent, gas, even the
checkout lines at Giant Eagle. Also rising is the amount
of advice being proffered to college students-—an ever-
widening sea of words.

' Anything that gains in size, including verbiage, eventu-
ally /loses differentiation. What’s surprising is that every
suggestion is prefixed by “I’m not going to tell you how to
livegyour life, but...” One is left wondering why these
people who offerthe secrets to success didn’t followthe
advice themselves.

This is especially true of majors. The original idea of a
college education was‘ to produce a versatile, well-
rounded person. Eventually, the need to specialize war-
ranted majors, but the idea (supposedly) wasn’t to
sacrifice general knowledge for the sake of a single sub-
ject. But that seems to be the trend: every semester comes
the cry for lowered graduation requirements. Rarely does
anyone suggest two years of Latin, yet that used to be the
standard. '

Advice, however, is not limited to majors; advice is
seldom limited to anything. Where and how one lives is
also a popular topic——avsubject especially grating to col-
lege students who live in squalor. Parents are almost
always willing to- judge the dorm room—-“it’s awfully
small, isn’t it?” or “you don’t have a roommate here, do
you?”——when the answer to both questions is obvious and
there’s not a damn thing anyone can do about it.

The list for topicsof advice is endIess—as endless as the
number of people who offer it. But maybe, just maybe,‘
Nietzsche was right: we’re responsible for our own
actions, and no one else’s.

An adviser can help you decide what are the best
courses, but he can’t decide what’s best for your life.

Existentialism means that you’re stuck with the benefits ‘

as well as the disasters that you—-and you alone—create.

So, a final piece of advice: forget advice. Suggestions
are wonderful, and sure your parents were young once,
but it’s still your ballgame, and no time-outs are left.

I ‘m going to tell you one word: Plastics.’

The City’s Rite of A utumh

By Mark Collins

In your dreams, you may see
arrows.

Arrows, the city says, are for
direction: They provide “alternate
routes," or “detour“ the flow oftraf—
fic. This is a convenient
euphemismvthe truth is that they
send motorists on a circuitous tour
of Oakland’s lesser traveled roads.

It .is construction time again, the
city, of Pittsburgh’s odd rite of
autumn. This time it is Forbes; last
year it was Fifth; next year it may be
the Cathedral lawn. or vour parents’
house, or your cat’s litter box. It is a
system without reason, purpose, or
time limit. The only certain thing is

,when it begins——the first day of

school. Every year. -
It seems that city planners fail to

realize the ripple effect of this uni-
versity. Not only do students return
in the fall, but their parents accom-

~ ipany them. Not only does the faculty

straggle back for the fall, but their
secretaries come back also. Pitt foot-
ball returns every autumn, along
with Saturday afternoon crowds.
There is never a good time to drive
through Oakland, and this year it is
worsened by the parkway shutdown.
And now construction--- the city .
cannot be accused of procrastina-
tion.

- Added to this is the parking situa-
tion in Oakland. At best, parking in
Oakland is traumatic. Last year, the
city installed new parking meters in
Carnegie Plaza that allow only quar-
ters to be used, whichlimits their use
to pinball fanatics who are awash
with silver. And now construction

eliminates even more off-campus
parking. One begins to wonder if
City Hall is top-heavy with
Duquesne graduates.

If we could be assured that the
new construction would last a
whilevsay, two or three years—
there would be far less grumbling.
But the streets of Oakland must
serve as guinea pigs for new resur-
facing techniques-experiments
which never quite pan out.

Perhaps the, best argument to
treat Oakland with special care is an ,
economic one. The University of
Pittsburgh is" the biggest employer in
the city. To anger an institution so
monstrous and lucrative must be
against some law of supply—and-
demand politics. Of course, the city
holds the trump card—a boycott of
Forbes Avenue would be difficult.

I don’t have to worry about the
broken hinge on the security door on
my apartment building because I
don’t live there anymore. I now live
in a new building with a security
system that works.

I don’t really care if the bath tub
drain in my old apartment is still
clogged. My new drain works per-
fectly.

I knew I might regret moving
further away from work. My time
spent driving to and from work has
now tripled. I wonder what it'll be
like this _winter? '

I don’t have to worry about the
intercom system not working in the
apartment building where I used to
live; because my new intercom sys-
tem works perfectly.

I don’t havelto worry about dogs
and cats being in heat in my apart-

aren’t allowed in my new complex.

I was worried that I might not get
credit for two courses I took forxmy

them out of order. I did receive the

I don’t have to worry about the

I'm not going to wait until the last

Re: You

By MARK COLLINS

\ i In an effort to prioritize priorities
here at the university, we are sending
this memo to inform anxious stu-
dents about The Law of the
University.

There is only one golden rule to
follow at Pitt. Classes, graduation,
majors, and health aresecondary to
this single, unavoidable law: pay
your bill.

Obedience to this law requires

either money or the promise of

money. The registrar's office is much
happier with cold cash or a reliable
check (like your mother’s), but will
also grudgingly accept either grants
or aloan statement from a reputable
ban/k. Due to‘ cash flow problems
faced by many students here, grants
and loans are awfully popular. But,
again this year, we must remind stu-

The Pitt News, Wednesday, September 2, I981

ExperiencedOffense,
Rebuilt Defense and at

The Pitt Panther football team
entered fall camp just Over two
weeks ago riding a wave of enthusi-
asm and extolling the virtues of keen
competition and a young group of
new starters whose turn had finally

come. V
Amazing what a week of three-a-

day practices can do.

A They can temper a team’s hopes,
set its fingers crossing for protection

, against injury, and otherwise glean

that Pitt’s l98l football team, just
four days removed from its first
game, still fields considerably more
question marks than constants,
thanks to a graduation rift that was
anything but kind.

“We have a long way to go with
our football team,” said Pitt head

' coach Jackie Sherrill last Saturday

shortly after camp had concluded.
“its a challenge.”

With the return of old standbys
like quarterback Dan Marino,
flanker‘ Dwight Collins and offen-
sive Emil Boures and Jimbo Covert,
Pitt’s quartet of possible All-
Americas, 'most of the challenge fac-
ingSherrill and his staff involves the
hasty reconstruction of the Pitt
defense, which returns only two of
II starters from l980~senior line-

' backer Sal Sunseri and sophomore

6 free safety Tom Flynn.

The revamped defensive line‘,
which lost all five starters, will start
junior middle guard J. C. Pelusi and
tackles Phil Puzzoli and Bill Maas in
the interior line. Maas. a 6-4, 258-

.pound sophomore. inherits the
starting slot originally slated forjun-
ior John Hendrick, who has not yet
recovered from serious knee surgery

. that also sidelined him most of last
season.

Hendrick, who has not yet been
able to practice with the team, was
billed by Sherrill as a “key" to the
Pitt defense before fall camp started.
but insiders say Hendrick may not
be back at all this season.

“His kneejust doesn’t seem to get
any better,“ said a Pitt trainer.-

At defensive end positions, 6-],

I96-pound junior Michael Woods
inherits the right side job. while
sophomore Al Wenglikowski, in a
mild surprise, has taken the starting
left end slot on the Panthers’ most
recent depth chart. Junior college
transfer Art Lowery, expected to

challenge for the job, has faded to —

third behind 6-6 freshman Chris
Doleman who has been drawing the
coaches’ raves all through camp.

And while this year’s line sacrifi-
ces some bulk compared to last
year’s front, Sherrill thinks they can
make up for size with some added
quickness.

“Our defense will keep chasing
you; they’ll be aggressive and very
physical,” Sherrill said yesterday.
“We’re going to go after people and
try to make things happen.”

Adding some needed experience
to the defense is Sunseri at one slot
and 6-2, 208-pound junior Rich
Kraynak at the other spot. Junior

'Ray Lao and a pair of impressive

freshmen, Caesar Aldisert and Troy
Benson, provide the most depth of
any area on defense.

Besides Flynn, the secondary
returns senior three-year letterman
Pappy Thomas, who steps into the
left cornerback job. Dan Short at
strong safety and Tim Lewis at right
corner enter their first season as star-
ters for Pitt.

Although defensive coordinator
Foge Fazio said yesterday that he’s
“very, very pleased with the progress
of our young players," Sherrill
admitted he has some edginess as the
Illinois game approaches.

“Certainly, we have a lot of

unknowns,” said Sherrill. “We have

a lot new faces that lack experience,
and we can expect some mistakes.
Other times, we’re going to have to
be in the right place at the right time.

“We have to stay healthy and put
things together in a hurry,” Sherrill
continued. “its a big question how
quickly our defensive team is going
to come.” .

To hasten their arrival, Sherrill
and Fazio will make some conces-

 Ton of Question Marks

sions to youth. Fazio plans to cut
down on the number and complex-
ity of defensive schemes the Panth-
ers will use, and Sherrill says the

coaches will continue to concentrate

on honing technique in the early
weeks of the season.

But while the rebuilt Pitt defense
may rise slowly, the Panther offense
returns mainly intact and will be
depended upon to be the strength of
this year’s team.

Marino, already third on Pitt’s

all-time passing list after starting.

just ll games, should continue to
riddle opponents’ secondaries this
year, thanks to a deep contingent of
talented receivers.

The leader, of course, is Collins,
who practically broke all Pitt’s
freshman receiving records last year
after switching from tailback to
flanker.

Besides handling his- flanker
chores this season, look for Collins
to occasionally drop intoithe back-
field and line up at the wingback
spot for Pitt.

Sherrill spent some time at the
University of Nebraska in the off-
season studying the way the Corn-
huskers deploy the wingback, and he
plans to install some new wrinkles in
the Pitt offense this year to protect
Collins from double- and, triple-
teaming. Sherrill said yesterday that
Collins may even occasionally line
up at the halfback slot.

“You’ll see Dwight running the
ball this year. We plan on gettingthe
ball to Dwight at least I5 times a
game,” Sherrill said.

Besides Collins, Pitt also returns
split end Julius Dawkins, a former
high school All-America who
showed open field running ability
last season when he returned punts
for Pitt. Dawkins can catch the ball
as well as he runs it, and he could
havea big year should opposing
teams leave him in one-on—one cov-
erage while they concentrate on
Collins.

end, gets the nod at tight end this

is the Panther offensive line, pro-
jected as one of the strengths ofthis
year’s team. Thankfully, it’s studded
with a literal ton of talent, led by
Boures at center and Covert at left
tackle.

Other probable starters include
Ron Sams at right guard, Rob Fada
at left guard and heralded freshman
Bill Fralic at right tackle. Fralic is
the only freshman to crack the
Panthers’ starting lineup so far this
year. ‘

After being one of the few weak-
nesses of last year’s team, the Pitt
punting game is dramatically
improved, according to Sherrill.

“Its like somebody waved a magic
wand over them,”Sherrill said. “Our
kicking game has been very
impressive.” ’

- Greg _Ganzer and Dave Hepler

depending on the situation, said
Sherrill. Hepler’s strong pointis his

Sketches

 By JOHNETTE HOWARD

The l 981 Pitt Panther football schedule-—-it‘s been called a
schedule that only a coach could love. It‘s been alleged in
Sports Illustrated that it was concocted by a pastry chef. As
the following thumbnail sketches of each opponent show,

it's also a schedule that Pitt fans may come to love if the -

Panthers can handle it as successfully as expected, even
though the team enters the season with a mountain ofques-
. tion marks.

Illinois
Sept. 5 -1:30 p.m.
Pitt Stadium

 

The Illinois University student newspaper. the Daily lllini,
dubbed this team the “Fascinating Losers,"the writer taking
considerable solace in the notion that while the team finished
just 3-7-I, they were at least exciting when they lost.

Generating all the excitement was aerial wizard Dave
Wilson, the quarterback who got a court order permitting
him to play in I980 against the Big l0’s orders. Wilson

' smashed I6 Illinois or Big I0 offensive records last year with
his passing show. But the curtain came down this summer
when the state Supreme Court ruled Wilson ineligible to
play in I98 I. Wilson went on tojoin the New Orleans Saints
as their No. I pick in the June supplemental draft.

Illinois‘ backup quarterbacks lack Wilson’s talent, the
Fighting lllini‘s running game is questionable and the Illini

defense .gave up an average of 29 points per game last year.
The Fighting Illini may have to struggle to match last year’s

record, despite the group ofjunior college transfers Coach _

Mike White has shipped in to add some immediate help.

Cincinnati
Sept. 19 -1:30 p.m.
Pitt Stadium

    

@L|'x¢.’v

After a one—week layoff, the Panthers face Cincinnati, 2-9
last year. against the likes of Richmond and Louisville.
Forty-four Iettermen, including I7 starters, return from last
year, which may help Pitt more than the Bearcats consider-
ing Cincinnati's 1980 record. Bearcat running backs Allen
Harvin and James Bettis, two former I000-yard rushers,
could test the Pitt defense.

South Carolina
‘Oct. 3 0 7:00 p.m.
Columbia, South Carolina

 

Like Pitt, South Carolina was hit hard by graduation,
with I2 starters gone from last year's Top 20 squad, most
notably Heisman Trophy winner George Rogers. The
Gamecocks have switched to a triple option attack this year,
built around running back Johnnie Wright, one ofthe team’s
top returners.

The Gamecocks will already have four games under their
belts when they face Pitt, while the Panthers will have played
just two contests, which may be an advantage for South
Carolina. Still, they don’t figure to repeat the Top 20 ranking
they had before their 37-‘) loss to Pitt in last season's Gator
Bowl. I 

  West Virginia
Oct. 10 -1:30 p.m.
Morgantown, West Virginia

 

The game often referred to as the Backyard Brawl takes’

place in the arch-rival Mountaineers’ home stadium, where
their fans are always vocal--make that deafening.

Besides testing the young Panther team’s poise, the Moun-
taineers should also prove a challenge for Pitt’s secondary.
Led by quarterback Oliver Luck, the Mountaineers are on
the rise under second-year coach Don Nehlen. West Virginia
is always tough, but the loss of running back Robert Alex-
ander and wideout Cedric Thomas weakens the offense. For
West Virginia to win, it will take more than Luck}

homa in the Orange Bowl, was the team that separated Pitt
from the I980 national title. Gone are two oftheSeminoles‘
key figures in their win last year running back Sam Platt
and placekicker Bill Capece. Also gone is receiver Hardis
Johnson, an academic casualty this season. Back are quar-
terback Rick Stockstill, punter Rohn Stark, who averaged
48 yards a kick in last year's game. and fullback Mike
Whiting. A schedule that pits the Seminoles against
Nebraska, Ohio State and Notre Dame on successive wee-
kends immediately preceding the Pitt game may sap Florida
State‘s strength by the time they face Pitt.

Dan Marino to Dwight Collins:
exciting, dangerous, spectacular,

tial. Those are onlv some of the
superlatives that have been used to

describe the much-ballyhooed pass-
ing combination that is expected to
make Pitt dangerous from anywhere"
in the stadium.

The media has a habit of making
grand predictions to enliven one's
imagination. In the case of the
Marino-to-Collins combination,
there is, after Collins’ sensational
rookie season, plenty of reason to be
exuberant. After all, both are mar-
velously talented athletes whose
potentials are a long way from being
tapped. But one combination does

not make an offense. Nobody knows.

Coming off that sensational fresh-

man year, Collins will be the object

other words, two men will be his
shadow during a game. Getting the
ball to him will be difficult, but get-
ting the ball to Dawkins should not
be. He could become the key to the
offense without a mere word men-
tioning him in preseason.

Two years ago, it was the Marino-

. to-Dawkins aerial combination that

had Pitt football fans drooling. But
a hand injury to Dawkins retarded
the’duo's progress in I979, and an
injury to Marino plus the play of
Willie Collier and the emergence of
Dwight Collins at flanker delayed
the dream—until this year.

Unlike his counterpart Collins,
whose straight-ahead speed can out-
run a defense, Dawkins, Pitt’s start-
ing split end this Saturday, .relies
more on precise routes and some
fancy moves after he safely cradles
the ball away. Dawkins revealed his
open-field running ability often last
year returning punts, one of Daw-
kins favorite duties on the football
field.

“Returning punts is very exciting,
and it gives me the chance to get the
football. I get a feel for the game by
returning punts," Dawkins
explained.

This year, Dawkins will not only
have Pitt’s punt return job all to
himself but the starting split end job
for the first time. His play at receiver
could be the key to the offense. An
open Dawkins can give a defense fits
with his pass-catching and especially
his running ability. This contribu-
tion‘ could prevent constant double
coverage on Collins.

“I expect Dwight Collins to get
double-teamed and I’m anticipating
the ball,“ said Dawkins. “John
Brown or I are going to be open, and
we will get the ball.” '

Dawkins’ confidence is only sur-
passed by his growing awareness of
the game.

‘I’ve been here two years and I
think I‘ve matured,” he said. “I
know the routes and the plays. Ever-
ything is falling into place.” _

The talent that made Collins a
Parade All-America selection for his
play at Monessen High School
indeed appears to be coming into
focus. Mel Blount, All-Pro corner-

back with the Steelers, might have
had something to do with that. This ‘

summer Dawkins took a trip to
Blount’s farm for what might well
have been a crash course on how to
beat defenders. I

f‘You know, I beat him a few
times, he beat me a few times. Most
of all I learned a lot and talked to
him,” Dawkins said. “I didn't know
him too well when we went down
there, but we‘ve become pretty good
friends.” .

Come Saturday, when Pitt opens
against Illinois, Dawkins admits
he’ll be nervous since this will be his
first start. But the butterflies will
likely disappear once the first hit is
absorbed. Dawkins appears to be his
usual confident self, and well he
might be. With the Marino-to-
Collins combination getting all the
headlines, Julius Dawkins might
have a few surprises for those people
who ‘say, “Julius who?‘i

Syracuse's hopes once again rest with senior halfback Joe \

Morris, the man who has broken many Syracuse rushing
records formerly held by the likes of Larry Csonka, Floyd
Little and Ernie Davis. At one point last season, the 5-7,
I82-pound Morris was the nation's second—leading ground
gainer before being slowed by injuries.

   ‘ Complementing Morris in the backfield are senior quar-

..rback David Warner, who rushed for 532 yards last year,
. and halfback Glenn Moore, who filled in admirably while
Morris was injured.

As Pitt showed in last year’s game, the key to beating the
Orangemen is shutting down the run. The passing attack
isn’t much, and the Orangemen’s defensive secondary is
weak, which should aid the Pitt offense. Syracuse went 6-5
last year, and the team starts this season under first-year

. coach Dick MacPherson. former linebacker coach for the
Cleveland Browns. a

And you didn’t know Rutgers even had a football team.
Although the school is known more for their basketball
team, the'S'carlet Knights surprised some teams last year en
routeto a 7-3-I record that included a l5—l5 tie with West
Virginia-and a f7-I3 loss to Alabama. Rutgers lost l7 players
to graduation last season, a group ninth-year coach Frank
Burns called the best group of seniors he's ever had. This
year‘s team should leave people still associating Rutgers with
basketball.

Pitt‘s 45-7 lashing of Army last year was the Panthers’
most lopsided victory of the season. In that game. Pitt
gained 578 yards in total offense including a record 436
yards through the air. Pitt has averaged over 500 yards total
offense in its last two meetings with the Cadets. In their last
six meetings, Pitt has averaged 43 points. Enough said‘?

interesting whenever the Owls and Panthers meet. Although
the Owls haven’t ‘scored more thantwo touchdowns in any of
the last five games against Pitt. the offensive gimmicks Har-

- pionships after all of Coach Joe Paterno‘s narrow misses.

But the Lions think they have the talent to challenge for the
national title, led by running back Curt Warner, an All-
America candidate, and ﬂeet receivers like Ken-ny Jackson
and Kevin Baugh. .

. Sophomore Todd Blackledge returns at quarterback, giv-
ing Penn State a strong arm as well as a scrambling threat at
the position. The offensive line is huge and the defense, as
always, should be tough. especially in the secondary. Being
at home helps Pitt, which will be hard-pressed to repeat last
year‘s win. Unless the Pitt defense matures in a hurry and the
running attack emerges by late season, the Panthers‘current
victory streak over Penn State could end at two.

N CAA, C FA

By JGHNETTE HOWARD
Sports Editor.

There’s a rebellion underway
within the ranks of the NCAA, and
the Collegiate Football Association,
the upstart group that recently ﬁred
first blast, is taking no
hostages—just the plunder.

At its Aug. 21 meeting in Atlanta,
the CFA—6l ofthe biggest and best
Division l-A, football programs in
the land—voted to ratify a four-
year, $l80 million television con-
tract with NBC. The move is in
direct conﬂict with the NCAA’s
recently, negotiated $236.5 million
‘pact with CBS and ABC, which, like
the CFA’s deal, begins with the l982
season. ‘Obviously, one contract has
got to go.

The CFA has set a Sept. l0 dead-
line for its members, which include

jheavyweights such as Pitt, Penn

State, Georgia, Alabama and Notre
Dame, to formally state whether
they intend to remain aboard for a
possible NCAA showdown or join
the Pacific I0 and Big l0, two con-
ferences that so far have stayed obe-
diently under the NCAA’s wing. Pitt
has already officially made its deci-
sion, according to Pitt Athletic
Director Cas Myslinski, but he
would not reveal which way Pitt is
going.

If all goes as expected. next
Thursday may come to be called the
CFA's D—day.

The brass ring that causes the
’(‘FA‘s loyalty to waver so is the issue
of property rights. which translates
to television and cable TV rights.
which pans out to—-what else?-a
substantial heap of money. _

Trout Gets Steeler Kicking  
Job Thanks to Strong Game

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Assistontsports Editor

The diminutive, sandy-haired
man walked confidently into the Pitt
stadium entrance. As he walks
through, players seemingly twice his
size -come out of their way to con—-
gratulate him, and shake his hand-
vigorously. A pat on the back here, a

“I knew you could do it” there. Yes,

cumbent Matt Bahr.

this was his day. A
At 5-7, he seemed well at home in
the weight room with all those behe-
moths pumping twice his own body
weight. Yes, this was certainly Dave
Trout’s day.
lt isn’t every day that a free agent
placekicker walks on to a four-time
Super Bowl champion team and
makes the team at such a key posi-
tion. Dave Trout had just accomp-
lished that. With the news coming
over the airwaves all day yesterday
that the former Pitt standout had
beaten incumbent Steeler Matt Bahr
for the placekicking shoes, Dave
Trout had plenty to be happy about.

In his four years at Pitt, the
soccer-style kicker who was raised in
Bolivia spoiled Pitt fans and the Pitt

defense alike with his consistent

kickoffs deep into the end zone, and
sometimes out of it. Rarely was a
kick returned beyond the 20. And

- yet he wasn't drafted and was forced

to sign on as a free agent. Not being
drafted was no surprise to Dave
Trout, and apparently, neither was
making the Steeler team. But~you
must excuse Trout right now. The
whole thing just hasn't quite settled
in yet. ,

Trout spoke carefully and slowly,
as his words reflected a man deter-
mined, but still aware that his real
test is still ahead, in the regular sea-

as it continues to ‘deliver main
attraction teams to sweaty-palmed
TV executives. Such expected prof-
its make the CFA willing to risk a
tussle vwith the NCAA and the
remaining 300-plus football mem-
bership over who will ultimately
award big—time collegiate game
rights. In essence, it’s been called a
fight for control of the game itself.

The remaining membership, after
the CFA, is largely comprised of the
smaller Division ll and Ill schools,
the football nobodies like the Gon-
iagas. These schools generate pre-

'cious little revenue, yet pack the

same clout as.an Alabama when vot-.
ing time comes around.

  

A , Myslinski put it: “We hd.on‘t:_f

«-»e~I-asa.I.i- ‘Glam 9, A.t§.;uv.-9'9’ N. .,.g.,',«.,;;..,.,,' 

pate in voting on our television
contract."

The current NCAA system, with
its one—school,one-vote set-up, has
the CFA seething, and not only at
the l4 percent cut of the television
payoff these 300 smaller NCAA
schools outside Division l-A now
enjoy.

The smaller schools also control
the largest voting bloc within the
NCAA, an unhappy fact that led to
the formation of the CFA some
years back in response to what the
bigger schools have termed “unfair
control." its a charge the CFA has
ever since been protesting and trying
to change through persistent but ‘so
far unsuccessful attempts. at legisla-

.. titmt. i,-sm;:¢i......~:,..,.«h¢s. NF A A :tw.i.aiiis;.   

have pushed for an elimination of
the vote inthe past, but we've had a
hard time doing it.”

But that was before revenues from
television rights spiraled in recent
years. This gives the CFA an effec-
tive weapon over the NCAA that
becomes more and more potent
yearly. Myslinski acknowledged
that, while property rights have
become the key issue in the fray, the
goal of the CFA is to win the restruc-
turing of Division I-A football, not
bolt the NCAA entirely.

“We don’t want to get away from
the NCAA. We would like to see a
restructuring ofthe NCAA code and
rules and regulations concerning

voting,“ explained Myslinski, as
member ntf. the (‘F'A;‘s. exemttive 

A football’s have in recen

"and the pressures of the NFL have
become a reality for him. The same
pressures that led to Matt Bahr’s exit
are now placed on Trout’s powerful

right leg. The toast of the town now, ‘

he could become the goat with one
missed extra point or field goal. No

one is more aware of the pressures’

than Trout.

“It comes with the job. You can’t
expect to hit every one but the pres-
sure is always going to be there. ‘If
you can’t handle it, then ‘ you
shouldn‘t be here.” «

He handled the pressure in the
preseason, especially in. Steeler’s
final preseason game against the
N.Y. Giants, where all seven of his

. kickoffs were in the end zone. Tack

on a 40-yard field goal and several
standing ovations, and you-have the
recipe for making it on a profes-
sional football team. But the hard
part has just begun—taking thejob
is one thing, keeping it is another.

“The work has just begun for me.
Making it was great, but l have to
concentrate and keep on working
hard or else all this will be in vain,”
Trout said.

Never was there any doubt about
the strength of Trout’s leg, which,
according to him,_comes from good
technique. Rather, his accuracy has
often been questioned. From the
‘outset of the Bahr-Trout battle.
Coach Chuck Noll had to decide

to Battle Over Property Rights

become a lever’?
“That’s right,” Myslinski said.
Besides the change in voting
procedure, the CFA also desires a
restructuring in other facets of Div-
ision l-A with, for example, tighter
restrictions on who qualifies as a l-A

member, according to David’

Cawood, NCAA public relations
director. - A
The by-product of all this, should
the CFA emerge victorious, is a shift
in control of big-time collegiate
football from the NCAA to the

_CFA.

Not surprisingly, the NCAA is
refusing to permit insurgents to ram
their wishes down the membership’s
throat, and the CFA’s promise of
returning $14-l5 million back into
the NCAA for its operating

expenses over the four years of the ‘

NBC contract is little solace. The
NCAA gets that now through an 8
percent slice of its CBS-ABC.
contracts. '

Besides a presumably larger cut of
the TV pay, with less, yet more pres-
tigious, members to share it with, the
CFA proposes other incentives like
additional _TV appearances above
the limits of two per year, and five
over two years (excluding bowl
games) now permitted by the
NCAA. ln addition, the CFA says it
can guarantee each of its members
$l million during the four years on
its contract, since each team is gua-
ranteed at , least two TV
appearances.

The CFA is also gambling that by
loosening controls on which games
NBC can televise, collegiate foot-

ding and start soaring ithe way pro

Pitt Defeats
Pepperdine In

Biggest Win Ever J

The Pitt Pantherette women's vol-
leyball team entered the gym of
eighth-ranked Pepperdine with a 0-3
record on its West Coast tour and
walked out with a victory that Pitt
Head Coach Shelton Collier termed
“the biggest win in the history ofthe
women’s volleyball program at

,Pitt.“

Pitt outlasted Pepperdine in a see-
saw match l0-l5, l5-2, 5-l5, I5-7
and l5-8, clawing back in the fourth
game to send the contest into the
final game.

Besides pulling offthe biggest win
in the history of Pitt’s program, the
victory also marked the first time an
eastern team has defeated a western
power, according to Collier. The
West traditionally boasts most of
the top women's and men’s volley-
ball teams in the nation.

“Our team reacted well. We just
rose to the occasion," Collier said of
the Pepperdine win.

Pitt’s other matches, all in the Los
Angeles area, were all losses in play
against two former national cham-
pions and two other top-ranked
teams.

After opening the tour August 25
with a scrimmage against USC, the
defending Division I national cham-
pion, the Pantherettes followed with
a scrimmage against top-ranked
UCLA and matches with the Uni-
versity of California-Irvine, Cal
State-Northridge, the defending
Division ll national champ, and San
Diego State. All the matches, except
the loss to San Diego, went to the
five-game limit before the Pan-
therettes. lost.

The West Coast tour was intended
as a tune-up for the team as it now

heads into its regional schedule with
its Sept. ll home opener against
arch-rival and reigning division
champ Penn State. The contest
promises to be a grudge match as
Pitt sets out to regain the title it won
in I978 and I979 before faltering at
last year‘s regional championships.
The Pantherettes entered regionals
with a shimmering 28-3 record
within their division but fell to Penn
State for the crown.

High expectations are held for
this years starting six. The lineup
includes five veterans, and it benefits
from the addition of two recruits.

Paula Olsen. a senior and last
year’s team captain, is a four-year
starter for the Pantherettes. Accord-
ing to Collier. “She’s spiking better
than ever."

V Anchoring the Pantherette front
line is 5-ll middleblocker Linda
Stadler, also a senior, whojoins set-
ter Julie Gaul and Robin Kukalis on
the veteran staff. Gaul and Kukalis
were invited to play for the East
squad at this summer’s National
Sports Festival in Syracuse, N.Y.

Two new starters,‘ Ulana Kohu-
tiak of Quebec and Judy Young of
Conneaut Lake, will add depth to
the already strong starting lineup.
Kohutiak visited Pitt last year as a
member of the Canadian Junior
Olympic Team, and Collier con-
vinced the freshman to come to Pitt.

With some tough early-season
games already under their belts, the
Pantherettes are looking forward to
next Friday's clash with Penn State
at Pitt's Trees Hall.

“The primary reason why we took
the trip was to upgrade theiteam,"
Collier said. “Both Penn State and

The Pitt women's volleyball team pulled the biggest upset in the history of the
program with a five-game match victory over eighthvranked Pepperdine last week.

Rutgers are considered our arch-
rivals. It should be a real good
match.” A

Collier saidthe key matchup to
watch against Penn State is at the
middleblockerlspot. where Stadler
will battle another of the East's best
at the position, Ellen Crandel.

After the Penn State match. the
Pantherettes will host the Pitt Invi-
tational, beginning Sept. l2, which
features most of the East’s top
teams. Besides Penn State, other
teams scheduled to compete include
Rutgers. Ohio State, West Virginia

and American University. The event ‘

is usually the annual highlight ofthe
Pantherettes’ home schedule. I

It was a full week after theM &
Ms defeated the Wimpies for the
Pitt co-rec intramural softball
spring championship, and Mark
Collins, bench jockey and spirit-
ual leader of the Wimpies, had

-already recovered from the
tough, 2,-0 title loss. '

“We thought they (the M &
Ms) would melt under pressure,
but it looks like we're the ones
without the asbestos under-
wear,” Collins said.

But “losing wasn’t so bad,"
Collins admitted. “Both teams
went out after the game. We had
a good time. ”

Perhaps, above all, a 'good
time and meeting people are
things that the Pitt intramurals
program can guarantee its par-
ticipants, along with the chance
to exercise rather than just be a
sports spectator. '

The latest available statistics
on Pitt intramurals show that
8,684 men and women,‘ or 784
teams, took part in competition
in I980--over one-fourth of
Pitt's student enrollment -of
32,400,‘ which includes students
in graduate and professional
schools.

“Our schedules have been
packed,” said Marilyn Ross, co-
director of the intramural pro-
grams, “We’ve had excellent
participation. It's getting so we
can’t even accommodate all the
people. Sports like racquetball
are booming."

" Ross’s office serves students
and faculty‘ by bringing them
together with persons interested
in playing individual or team
intramural sports. Ross said the
office is especially helpful when

someone wants to participate in
a sport but is not affiliated with a
team.

“If an individual is interested
in playing a team sport but
does_n’t have a team, we can take
their name and phone number
and put them on a team," accord-
ing to Ross.

Currently, there are seven div-
isions of Vcorr'1petition—

fraternity, dormitory, engineer-
ing, graduate-faculty, women’s,
co-rec and independent. Compe-.
tition is held in 16 different
sports, the specific sports
depending on the current aca-

demic term.

This fall, the intramural pro-
gram will offer tennis,soccer and

the NFL

The biggest disappointment ofthe
graduate Pitt football players had to
be the dismissal of Benjie Pryor
from the Cincinnati Bengals. Pryor,
a third round pick, had the potential
to be a good player according to
most observers. He apparently irked
Bengal coaches when he reported

late to camp and out of shape. He"

also ran into a punter and dropped a
pass in one exhibition game.

The most pleasant surprise is the
recent announcement that Dave
Trout will be handling all kicking
chores for the Steelers, having
beaten out Matt Bahr. The former
Pitt star impressed Steeler coaches
with his booming kickoffs. Trout
signed on as a free agent, and was
told he had to beat out Bahr for the
job. He may have been the longest
shot of any Pitt senior.

* * * * *

Speaking of Pitt players in the
NFL, no less than l3 former Panth-
ers made it to the big leagues. If
anybody still wonders who the best
team in the nation was last year, then
stop. N0 team in recent history has

had such an influx of talent into the
pros. Of the 13 Panthers, 10 are

starters. Hugh Green is starting at
outside linebacker for, the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers, who boast three
other Pitt graduates. Randy McMil-
lian is the Colts’ starting fullback,
while’ Mark May and Russ Grimm
are both first stringers for the
Washington Redskins. The Skins
are counting on the two to open up

I holes for Joe Washington and John.

Riggins.

The most impressive Pitt player
has been Ricky Jackson who has
been called the “best defensive
player on the team” by Saint coach
Bum Phillips. Jackson has also

received accolades from Saint quar- if '

East League Hires an Expert

After months of speculation, talk
and political orchestrating, suppor-
ters of the proposed Eastern sports
league recently to take their first
concrete step toward formation of
the new conference.

Officials, most of them athletic
directors, from seven Eastern
schools—Pitt, Penn State, West Vir-
ginia, Syracuse, Temple, Boston
College and Rutgers-—met.Iuly2l in‘
Cape Cod and agreed to hire a con-

Eastern 8
Goes on
Hold

Officials from the Eastern 8 bas-
ketball league’s member schools
converged on Pittsburgh July 7 for
their summer meeting, all hoping for
some long, loud and encouraging
remarks to ebb their growing fears
about the future of the outfit.

What they got from League Com-
misioner Leland Byrd and his staff
however, was a whimper. The

I members adjourned until Nov. l4

with some major ongoing issues still
swirling above their heads like a
storm cloud ready to explode.

As expected, Byrd asked for
future commitments of one to two
years from the members and no one

 

sultant. The consultant will investi-
gate the histories and operations of
existing conferences, study available
television markets, and make
recommendations on how to begin

actual formation of a sports league
for the East.
After the loose blueprint ofa new

conference is submitted by the con-
sultant, the next step to be taken by
the would-be members will most
likely be the hiring of a league com-
missioner. And not too long after
that, it may be play ball——if basket
ball schools Boston College and Syr-
acuse do not balk at going along
with the all-sports format demanded
by Pitt and Penn State.

raised a hand.

League expansion wasidiscussed
and a list of possible candidates was
drawn up, but formal action on

 

expansion will wait until after the
November meeting.

Byrd reported that his year—long
effort to secure an Eastern 8 televi-
sion package has not yet been suc-
cessful. The membership authorized
him to keep up the search for spon-
sors as a last-minute effort to get the
league on TV this year.

With the new East sports league
looming on the horizon and with
three of the proposed league’s
members—Rutgers, West Virginia
and Pitt-involved in its discus-
sions, the sun could be setting
behind the Eastern 8 after this sea-
son's commitments expire.

Sherrill Signs F ive-year Pact

Pitt Panther football coach Jackie
Sherrill signed a “rolling” five-year
contract May 20 that will be renewa-
ble annually with the mutual agree-
ment of both parties.

The term “rolling” means that
after each year of the contract is ful-
filled, Pitt and Sherrill can agree to
add another year to the remaining

again making the contract’s term for
five years.

includes

9

The contract also
“penalty clauses in both cases‘
should either Pitt or Sherrill decide
to terminate the contract before the
initial five—year period expires.

Although the exact nature of the
penalties was not revealed. Sherrill
would presumably be required to
pay some type of compensation

should heaccept another coaching
job, and Pitt would be required to
compensate Sherrill should it decide
to end the contract.

Lewis Siphons Top Talent
Wins Pa. Recruiting War

The Pitt Panther swim team’s six-
year lock on the NCAA Eastern

Regional title seems likely to be
extended a few more years, thanks
to a nine-man battery of recruits that
Coach Fred Lewis signed this
summer that includes six high
school All-Americas.

In the process, Lewis said he
thinks he’s siphoned off practically
all the top talent in Pennsylvania.

“This is the first time I feel we’ve
really cleaned up in the state,” Lewis
said. “Individually there is some
great talent in this group.”

The six All—Americas who will
join Pitt this {all are: Dave Lezek,
Kiski Prep (200 and 400 freestyle)
Greg Murphy. Kiski Prep (200 and
500 freestyle, 400 freestyle relay);
Shawn McClain, Midlothian, Va.
(one-meter diving); George LaNoue,
Hershey (state champion in 50 and
I00 freestyle); Ed Bergan, East
Allegheny (state champion in I00
backstroke); and Doug Condon.
Highlands High (state champion in
I 00 breastroke).

Rounding out the nine-recruit
roster are local swimmers Jeff
Fulmer of Plum. Gene Sitt of High-
lands and Phil Slaitc of Franklin
Regional.

Of the plethora of outstanding
achievenients and honors that the
recruits hax-c previously won. maybe

I  ““i?"‘

the most impressive is that Bergan
has already turned in times faster
than some collegiate All-Americas.

“We’ve always had a lot of great
individual performers in recent
years, but we’ve needed depth,” said

Pitt’s Sam Clancy and Carlton
Neverson were chosen in the third
round of the June 9 NBA draft.

 
 

   

Suprisingly, Neverson, a 6-foot-5
guard was drafted five picks ahead
of Clancy in the third round. Never-
son is headed to the Golden State
Warriors, where he expects his role,
at the outset at least, to provide the
team with some needed bench
strength.

“In the NBA, you have to have
consistency and be able to come in
and score at any needed time,” Nev-
erson said. ‘‘I’m just pretty excited
to get the chance to play in the pros.”

Clancy, the Phoenix Suns‘ No. 3
pick, said immediately after the
draft, “l’ll have to work hard to get
on the team. It feels good to be
picked to play.”

Apparently, Clancy‘s hard work
has already paid o_ff. Phoenix was so
pleased with Clancy’s performance
at its summer camp, especially with
his rebounding, that they reportedly
signed the 6—foot-6 forward to a
multi—year contract.

January by the NCAA and Nat-ional

Senate Rules Athletes Must Attend

 

who are on academic probation or
who failed a course in the immediate
previous term will have to submit
class attendance cards signed by
their instructors, to the athletic
department each Friday.

If the student-athlete fails to sub-

mit the card or fails to attend any
course regularly for two consecutive
weeks, he or she will be ineligible for
practice, competition or travel for a
week.

Not surprisingly, Pitt athletes had
various reactions.

“I think it’s a wonderful idea,"
-said Pantherette basketball point
guard Debbie Lewis.

“It sounds like a real pain in the
butt,” said Pitt Panther swimmer
Sandy Pidgeon.

threats of suspension’ of member-

ship, a specter the CFA regards as
highly unlikely.

“Undoubtedly, the NCAA will try
to stop the CFA from trying to get
its teams on TV," said Myslinski.
“But they couldn’t even do that
penalty act. Most of the champion-
ships the NCAA offers are won or
dominated by teams from our 61
schools. There’s nothing they can

So far, the CFA has kept its posi-
tion, daring the NCAA to go
through with its threats ofexpulsion
and gambling the NCAA won’t
commit what both sides agree is
suicide.

“lt could mean the breakup ofthe
NCAA,” conceded Cawood, "but
our organization can‘t afford to
ignore a segment ofthe membership
breaking the rules. lf some individu-
als think we can’t take action that
could destroy the NCAA, it’s unfor-
tunate, because that’s what will
happen. I hope it doesn’t." ‘

So does the CFA, which hopes it
doesn’t come to that. The CEA is not
interested in taking over all the legis-
lative, governing and regulatory
duties the NCAA now provides for
all sports, men’s and the newly
accepted women’s programs. Begin-
ning with the 1981-82 school year,
the NCAA will offer national cham-

Cpionships in both men’s and

women’s sports for the first time.

“We don’t want to get away from
the NCAA,” Myslinski repeated.
“But I don’t think it will come to
that.‘.’ To prevent it, Myslinski’, said
the two sides will have to start mov-
ing toward each other and together
work out the various differences the
two bodies have.

“We put a lot of money into our
football programs, and we’re gam-
bling.” Myslinski said.'“We want to
get some of it back. lf cable comes
in, we want to make sure we get
some of it for our programs."

“Nobodyknows what’s going to
happen with cable," said‘ Joe
Paterno, Penn State football coach

and athletic director. “But if we give
up our property rights now. we may
riot ever get them back."

And when will the NCAA know
whether the CFA membership will
go‘ ahead with the head-to-head con-
frontation or withdraw‘?

“They should know by the after-
noon of September I0," Myslinski
said. ' C

to Texas

A phone call early June 8 from a
newsman at Pittsburgh Pirate draft
headquarters via Pitt Panther base-
ball coach Bobby Lewis informed a
surprised Allen Lachowicz that the
Texas Rangers had made him their
first ‘round choice and 27th pick
overall in the major league free agent
draft.

“Who?" Lachowicz said.

“The Rangers," Lewis repeated.

“I was surprised,” said Lacho-
wicz, who immediately went rifling
through the newspaper for some
quick information on his new team.

The 6-foot-3 righthander, who
boasts a fastball that’s been clocked
at over 90 mph,\ had expected to be
picked by the third round of the
‘draft but gave himself only a thin
chance to go as early as he did.

Lachowicz was assigned initially
to the Rangers Sarasota farm club.
Before developing a sore arm when
Sarasota’s coaches tried to tinker
with his pitching motion, the
Rangers had hinted that Lachowicz
could move right up to the team’s
Double A club with a good showing.

While LachoTvicz was blazing a
trail toward the majors, Pitt’s other
draftee, pitcher Larry LaMonde,
floated in the back door, thanks to
his knuckleball. LaMonde was
drafted in the 21st round by the
Pittsburgh Pirates. He called his
chance with the Bucs’ system “a
dream come true.”

LaMonde was assigned to the
Pirates’ Bradenton farm team,
where he has pitched well enough to
earn the tag of "prospect” from
Pirate farm director Murray Cook.

“He's got a real good knuckle-
ball,” according to Jon Neiderer,
assistant scouting director for the
Pirates. “With that pitch, you’ve got
to give him a chance to make it to the

  Radecic
Wins Two

 East Titles

Pitt Pantherette field specialist
Peri Radecic took third place and
All-America honors May 16 at the
l98l AIAW outdoor track national
championships. Radecic became

the second All-America in the his- A

tory of Pantherette track, thanks to
a throw of 44.24 meters (I45-2),
placing her just behind winner Pat
Washington of Southeast Missouri

-§(45.50mI and runner-up Jane

(‘Sumner of Southern Illinois-
Evansville (45.14 m.)

Pitt’s other former All-America
was sprinter Gwen Murray. Murray,
asenior last year, qualified for the
outdoor championships but was
forced to scratch from her events,
the 400- and 200-meter dashes,
because of a hamstring injury.

Radecfc had also qualified for the
meet in the shot put, but an over-
sight during the typing of the ﬂight
sheets for the event resulted in the
omission of her name. Pitt women’s
track coach Alfreeda Goffand her
assistant could not attend a pre-meet

 "xconference, where they might have

ssaught the error, and officials later
W ruled Radecic ineligible to compete

PERI RADEClC~

in the shot. Radicic had thrown over
over 45 feet last year, a distance that
would have placed her in the top
four at the meet. ‘

Just one week earlier, at the
AIAW Eastern Regionals, Radecic
captured both the shot put and dis-
cus titles.

Dave Belowich, head women’s .

swimming and diving coach at the
University of South Florida for the
past year, was named to replace
Dick Bradshaw, who resigned May
22 after 12 seasons as Pitt Pan-
therette head women’s swimming
and ‘diving coach.

Bradshaw stepped down after
over a decade of coaching his Pan-
therette teams to consistent Top 20
national rankings and several East-
ern titles, the latest coming in 1980.
Bradshaw also coached Kathy

L Stetler and Suzanne Pulley, Pitt’s
only four-year All-Americas besides
Panther football's Tony Dorsett and

 

Hugh Green.

Bradshaw, who moved on to
become coordinator of Pitt’s Aqua-
tic and Physical Education and
Recreation programs said his new
positionwill allow him to teach ful-
ltime as well’ as work toward his
Ph.D.

previous stint as an assistant at Flor-
ida State._ His team’s showing last

According to Belowich, his posi-
tion at Pitt presents a different chal-
lenge for him than this’ former

coaching jobs, and he’s looking for- /

ward to it.

“Before, we were just trying to
resurrect the programs,” Belowich
said of his other teams. “Here,
thanks to Bradshaw, the team is

strong. Myjob here is to continue it t

and get the team the national recog-
nition it deserves.”
