tuition raise
higher than
PA residents’

elissa Blackwood:

43$, .. . .’ ,

   

Pitt trustees will soon approve a
tuition raise for out—of-state students that
is almost triple that of in-state students.

The University’s proposed 1997-
1998 operating budget, which includes a
4.5 percent tuition hike for in-state stu-
dents and a 5.5 percent bike for out-of-
state students, breezed through the Board

‘ of Trustees’ budget committee last week.

All that’s left to make it official is
approval by the full Board of Trustees,
and that’s expected to happen at the
board’s summer meeting tomorrow
moming.

Full—time tuition for the College of
Arts and_Sciences will cost $5,658, or

_ $242 more than last year.

Out-of—state students. will be hit even
harder. Their tuition is set to go up $646
to $12,422.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
defended the increase as the only way to
balance the budget this year.

“We don’t have a lot of maneuvering
here,” Nordenberg said after the commit-
tee meeting. “If we didn’t have to raise
tuition, we wouldn’t, but as costs rise, we
have to find a way to pay for them.”

According to Nordenberg, Pitt want-
ed more money from the state this year,
but didn’t get what they asked for.

In May, the Pennsylvania General
Assembly approved a $153.1 million
subsidy to Pitt.

That is $4.6 million more than last
year, but Nordenberg says it is not
enough for Pitt to remain competitive.

As a condition of the appropriation,
Pennsylvania state legislators put a cap
on Pitt tuition increases for in-state stu-
dents but set no parameters for out-of-
state tuition. 5

“We have to have a heightened sense
of quality to maintain student interest,”
he said. “We looked very carefully at
tuition, and we feel the market can prob-

Two hundred people ﬂed Pitt’s
Chevron building last week after a
graduate student project went awry
and released a cloud of hydrochloric
gas on the llth ﬂoor.

City fire trucks and police cars
surrounded the building behind‘
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial while
occupants filed into an adjacent park-
ing lot.

The professor overseeing the.
failed experiment stayed in the build-
ing and assisted in the clean—up.

Wrapped in heavy, white plastic
suits and toting air tanks, city and
University hazardous materials teams
entered the building to clear the nox-
ious gas. Hydrochloric fumes can

Seventy students in the middle of

a chemistry final were forced to stop
their exam as Pitt and city HazMat

crews rushed them outside shortly

Keller said the two organic chem-

sizing chemicals when the accident
occurred. .

“The synthesis reaction went
faster than they expected and the
action evolved hydrochloric gas,” he
said. .

Keller and his team neutralized
the gas with a base compound and
tested the air with Ph paper as fans
cleared the air. 1

One Pitt employee waiting out-

crews to finish the cleanup joked
with others waiting to get back in.

“I’m ‘going to get a call from my
Dad saying ‘find another business!”’
joked the man.

HazMat crews in the Chevron

cloud from the 11th floor while giant
fans were used to blow the gas out-
side.

College difficult enough without
unfair tuition hike, soy students

nlhony Brezniccin

 

Out-of-state student “Marquette
Bowman wasn’t happy about the 4.5 per-
cent tuition hike. ,

“What are you going to do?” he said.
“You have to pay it if your education is that
valuable.”

But the Student Govemment Board
member was angry when he heard out—of-
state tuition is going up 5.5 percent, and the
4.5 percent ﬁgure applies only to in-state
students.

“You mean to tell me that out—of-state
students are paying a larger chunk of
money, and it’s going up by 5.5 percent,
while other students are paying 4.5 percent
on a smaller chunk of money? That’s
appalling,” he said. Like Bowman,
many students were angry over the
increase.

Last year, most out-of-state students
paid $11,776 to come to Pitt, but this year,
they will pay $646 more. Two semesters at
Pitt for them will now cost $12,422.

In—state students paid around $5,416 in
tuition last year. Two semesters will now
cost $5,682, an increase of only $242.

Dom1a,Terlesky, who is coming back
to college to study veterinary medicine,
said she can only take classes part—time
because she must work during the week to
pay tuition.

“I can’t go to school unless I work, and
I can’t get ﬁnancial aid unless I am a full-
time student,” she said. The tuition hike
will only make it harder for her, even
though she is an in-state student.

Terlesky said she didn’t think Pitt

administrators understood the burden they
were placing on students.  -6/' I

“Obviously they don’t relate to my sit-
uation,” she said.

Okechukwu Keke, an out—of-state
sophomore majoring in computer science,
said he knows many people who will be
forced to leave school because of the
increase.

“They’ll say they’re taking a year off,
but once you leave and start working, it is
hard to come back,” he said.

Incoming freshman Jen Chemello of
Allentown, Pa., said her father is already
working two jobs to send her to Pitt.

“I get some ﬁnancial aid now, but if
tuition keeps going higher, my dad can’t
takega third jo ,” she said. “My parents
don’t want me to work because they know
I’ll need all my energy for school.”

Like many students, Aisha Dennehy,
another incoming freshman from the
Pittsburgh area, said she was glad teachers
were getting a 3 percent salary raise. _

“How much are they making now?”
asked Keke, When told the average profes-
sor’s salary was $60,000, he agreed they
deserve it.

Incoming freshman Mike O’Connor_

was one of the few who said the tuition hike
didn’t matter.
“My parents are paying for it,” he said.
“I don’t care; they get the b’ .”
_ While most students remain angry
over the new budget, almost all agree the
University must start showing students
where the money goes.
I “I don’t mind paying more if improve-
ments are being made,” said Bowman.
“But where are they?”

Q

Anthony Breznican/Ea'itor—in-Chief

Pitt trustees look over the tuition raise at last Thursday's meeting.

Tuition

ably handle a 4.5 percent increase”,

Nordenberg also pointed out that Pitt
is not the only school raising tuition this
year.
The University provided ﬁgures
comparing Pitt’s tuition with that of 13
other universities around the region.

“If you look at the list, we’re really
not out of line with increases at other
comparable universities,” Nordenberg
said. “Pitt is actually fourth from the bot-
tom.”

The data, though, compared Pitt’s
tuition to what it would cost
Pennsylvania residents to go to school at
places like Boston University, Syracuse
University and the University of
Delaware — all located in other states.

Pennsylvania residents would be
charged a higher, out—of—state tuition to
attend such schools.

Pitt did not compute the differences
between in-state and out—of-state prices
at these schools.

Pitt also did not take into account the
difference in prices between private
schools, such as Carnegie Mellon
University, and public schools such, such
as Indiana University of Pennsylvania,
when comparing prices.

The budget does contain good news
for some Pitt students, though.

Tuition in the School of Engineering
will remain frozen for the third straight
year.

Nordenberg said it’s part of an effort
to make it more competitive.

“Tuition in the School of
Engineering has traditionally been much
higher than CAS and other comparable
engineering schools,” Nordenberg said.

Last year, a full-time in—state engi-
neering student paid $6,316 for two
terms — $900 more than in—state CAS
students pay for the same two terms.

With this year’s increase in tuition,
the gap between engineering students
and CAS students will be lowered to

FROM PAGE I

$658.

Nordenberg said the freeze in the
engineering school’s tuition will end
when tuition rates for CAS catch up to
those of engineering. At the current rate,
that should come in three years.

Tuition is the single largest source of
revenue for the University, accounting
for more than a quarter of Pitt’s armual
operating budget. Pitt expects to collect
$249.5 million from student tuition and
fees, bringing this year’s total operating
budget to $855.1 million

That’s up $21 million over last year’s
budget.

The operating budget pays for Pitt’s
general operating costs, such as salaries,
beneﬁts, maintenance and utilities.

In addition, $2 million of this year’s
budget is allocated for improvements in
the quality of student life.

According to Provost James Maher,
the money will be used to add staff to the
counseling center and the advising and
placement 0fﬁCCS, as well as to upgrade
several computer labs on campus.

“We are also looking for student fees
that can be eliminated, mostly in the
health sciences,” Maher added.

Pitt’s biggest expense is salaries.
This year’s total compensation is project-
ed to increase by $9.5 million to $478.6
million.

That means a 3 percent raise for most
professors.

The trustees’ budget committee also
approved a $60.1 million capital budget
to begin implementing a 10-year capital
improvement plan -——— including $16 mil-
lion for improvements to the Masonic
Temple and campus athletic facilities and
classroom renovations, as well as
installing computer ports in resident
halls.

The capital budget does not include
costs for improvements to Bigelow
Boulevard, which will be shared between
Pitt and the City of Pittsburgh.

Burns claim life of Betty Shabazz

NEW YORK —— Betty Shabazz, the widow
of Malcolm X, died Monday from bums she
received in a ﬁre at her apartment on June 1.

The ﬁre was allegedly set by her grand-
son Malcolm Shabam. According to the 12-
year-old boy’s attorney in yesterday’s New
York Post, the charges against Malcolm
Shabazz have been upgraded to murder upon
the death of his grandmother. The boy has not

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The U.S. House
of Representatives voted to spend $4.5 mil-
lion next year on a clinical trial to evaluate
treatments for Gulf War veterans Monday.

A report, released Monday by the
General Accounting Oﬂice of the House,
criticizes how the Pentagon, the Department
of Veterans’ Affairs and a presidential com-'
mission have studied the the disorder called
Gulf War Syndrome.

The agencies deny the accusations.

The report states that research into the
syndrome did not begin until three years after
the end of the Gulf War and that it took com-
plaints from many ailing veterans to get the

government to investigate their illness.

SYRACUSE, N.Y. —— Federal authorities

reservation. An indictment charges 21 people
with money laundering and racketeering.

ROSWELL, N.M. — Next week is the
50th anniversary of the Roswell Incident.
The Roswell Incident occurred when an

Although thousands of people are expected

concentrated, said Rebecca Claycamp,
assistant director of the chemistry
department.

“The spill wasn’t quite so bad,”
Claycamp said. “We just don’t like to
take chances. Any time there is a bad
spill or a suspected spill, or we just
smell something noxious we pull the
alarm.”

Authorities kept the crowd across
the street from the building and were
reluctant to release details to the curi-
ous students and employees.

“All I want to know is ‘Can I get
my bike?,”’ said Benjamin Walker, a
sophomore who works in the building

and wanted to cross the police line to
get his bicycle. “I want to go home.”

Still, officials kept him cordoned
off with the rest of the crowd.

Some in the crowd were less eager
to leave.

The students hoping to ﬁnish their
test waited anxiously for to get back
into the building and pick up their
pencils.

“Chemistry is not something you
can just start or stop doing,” said
chemistry professor Peter Siska. “You
have to be in the right mindset.”

Students were permitted to go
home if necessary, but most of them
said they were too worried about their

 

exam.

“I’m waiting until I can finish my
test,” one woman said to her compan-
ion as they waited in a nearby parking
lot. “Do you have any idea how long
this will take?”

It was almost two hours before the
emergency vehicles left the scene, and
the building was reopened. By that
time, the crowd had dwindled to
almost half its original size.

No classes were officially can-
celled because of the spill, according
to Pitt spokesman Ken Service.

This is the second chemical spill
at Pitt this month.

June 4. In that incident, two secre-
taries were taken to the hospital for
observation after smelling gas from a
leaking hydrochloric tank, according
to Keller.

Despite the relatively short
amount of time between the two acci-
dents, Keller said the University will
not set any new guidelines for the han-

“This is an educational institution,

  Pitt tuition
increases are
suffocating
students

Pitt students cannot afford the tuition
increases we are facing this year. Out—of-
state students are going to be hit with an
increase of $646 and in—state students
with one of $242. For the average strug-
gling college student, both of these ﬁg-
ures are huge. So we, the students, are

begging the University: Please, don’t do '

it. Please don’t raise tuition. You’re
killing us.

Many of us have set aside just
enough money to pay for school without
me increases, and we are going to have to
ﬁnd a way to make up that difference. A
difference of $646 is not likely to come
out of pocket cash.

Those of us who will be working
throughout the school year are not going
to be able to make up the difference in our
next paycheck, or with an entire year’s
worth of paychecks, not after we struggle

'topayourrentandtobuyfoodtokeepus

alive. Many of us are already worldng all
summer just to have the money that it
was going to cost to go to school before
the increase and won’t have an opportu-
nity to save any more.

The University has tried to justify the
increases by comparing our tuition with
other schools — that is, with schools we
shouldn't be compared with. It is not rea-
sonable to justify Pitt's in-state tuition by
saying that it is less than Syracuse’s put-
of-state tuition. Many of us have come to
Pitt because it was the best school around
here that we poor kids could afford.

Sure, $242 or $646 isn’t much
money over the course of a year. The
problem is that year after year tuition
rises “just a little.” Pitt students have been

taking it for 23 years. They can’t take

much more.

Some students will put themselves in
a dire situation to stay in school here,
whether that means nearly starving come
the end of each semester because they’re
out of money, putting the difference on a
credit card (if it isn’t already maxed out
paying outrageous prices for textbooks),
or working 1ate—night hours when they
should be studying. And we can’t really
borrow any more loan money, since
many have borrowed the maximum they
are allowed already. Did you know that
the cost of Pitt tuition is already greater
than the maximum loan amount allowed
by Guaranteed Student Loans?

Pitt is going to lose a lot of students
this year. Hopefully, those who stay
won’t be starving to death in March.
Please, show some mercy, Pitt. Please
don’t raise our tuition.

Phoenix Arizona.

Is there something out there? Is there truth to
UFO theories? As I read, I found myself drawn
almost irresistibly toward belief. I found myself
thinking that the government must be hiding all
kinds of things from us —— that area 51 must con-
tain numerous wrecked alien spacecraft. Then I
paused, agnosticism reasserted itself and I thought
of my personal adventure of belief with the chest-
nut tree.

Once, years ago, I read an article in National
Geographic about the American Chestnut tree, and
its sufferings under the chestnut blight. The article
described the decline of this tree, from former

I don’t believe that aliens are visit-
ing us. But I don’t disbelieve it either.

You see, I've decided to reserve
judgment until there is some com-
pelling evidence one way or the other.
But I'm not going to start believing or
concocting crazy theories in order to
make it seem possible that we are
being visited by aliens. For one thing,
I just don’t ﬁnd the so-called evidence
some people cite of UFOs to be com-
pelling. Considering the crap that
passes today for art and sculpture, we
don’t need aliens to explain
Stonehenge. And I don’t believe peo-
ple who say they were abducted. It’s
just too easy tomake something like
that up. Also, their evidence is a lot
like the things children of satan-wor-
shippers recite ontalk shows. So, I’m

  

I want to believe it? Of course. I
grew up watching Star Wars and
Battlestar Galactica , as well as “Buck
Rogers” and “Star Trek” reruns. As a
young kid, I could think of nothing
cooler than ﬂying around in a starship
while shooting aliens. (Okay, okay, I
did have some serni-violent tenden-
cies. But at least I didn’t melt my little
sister's dolls with a magnifying glass
in the sun!) '

Imagine not being conﬁned to one
world and, instead, having the whole
universe at your ﬁngertips! Imagine
standing on another planet where you
can watch a twin-sunset! Or being the
first person to make contact with an
alien race. Imagine going down in his-

Perhaps these visions of beauty
and delusions of grandeur don’t appeal
to everybody, but they do appeal to a
lot of us. It’s neat to imagine that we’re
not alone in the universe, so I under-
stand why many people would want to
believe in UFOs.

But it takes an awful lot of imagi-
nation to keep those dreams when you
realize what it would take for them to
be true.

Einstein made it seem pretty
impossible to conceive interstellar
travel when he informed us of a limit
to how fast we can travel: the speed of
light. This limit means that it would
take a minimum of 4.5 years to get to
the nearest star from our sun, and that
system does not look very promising
for life. The possibility of another civ-
ilization existing increases as we allow

Chestnuts a

master of eastern forests to the status
of an occasional shoot growing up
from old roots. These small saplings
would dash toward the light, toward
freedom of the forest canopy, only to
be girdled by the blight again, as so

‘often before. The tragedy, the nobility,

of the chestnut struck very near my
heart, and I resolved to do what I
could to save the tree. I wanted very
much to find an American Chestnut
growing in my family’s forests -—— to
ﬁnd The Chestnut that would resist the
blight and return to America’s forests
the trees which stood so tall and green
and full of nuts in the woodlands of
my dreams.

When I wandered in the woods, I
searched carefully, diligently for The
Chestnut — watching, hoping that it
would show its face. One day, among
the trees that stand above a ﬁeld, over-
looking the barn and houses, with the
pond glinting below me, I found a
tree. It was winter, but.a few leaves
clung to a small branch, close enough
that I thought I could identify them in
the late afternoon sunlight. I gathered
leaves from the base of the tree —
loose ‘leaves that had blown in the
winds —— carried them home and

THE PITT NEWS

 

began pouring through tree identifica-
tion books. The leaves were a little too
short, a little too round, but almost the
right size, almost the right shape.

I remember telling a friend that I
had found an American chestnut tree
and being disappointed by his unen-
thusiastic response. To him, this did
not seem special. To him, this did not
seem like a gift from the gods. I was
disappointed, for to me, this seemed
like a singular and unique blessing.

For a month or two, I treasured in
my heart the knowledge or illusion
that I had found a Chestnut. Spring
came and with it new leaves. I looked
eagerly at my “chestnut” and found
the its leaves were of a white oak. The

"‘chestnut” leaves I had discovered

that winter had been travelers from a
nearby beech tree. .
When I read of UFO theories or
visit Mumia Abu-Jamal rallies or ﬁnd
myself wishing for something so hard
that I can almost imagine it to be true
or believing somethingjon little infor-
mation because I want it to be fact, I
often pause to think of the aforemen-
tioned chestnuts. At times, our wish
for a Chestnut can lead us to fall for an
oak, and at times, by identifying wind-

FROM PAGE 6

blown leaves, we can fool ourselves.
The story doesn’t end here though —
with time, The True Chestnut may
appear. ' ’

For many years, I was without a
chestnut tree. I planted some Chinese
chestnuts, but after a year or two of
disappointing growth, they quit this
world for a better one. Then, last year,
while walking through one of the old-
est forests of the farm, following a
forester who had come to look over
our trees, I came upon a small shoot
on‘ the forest floor, bearing the leaves
of an American chestnut, the brave
survivor of some mighty forest
monarch which fell a hundred years
ago. Thus the story comes full circle.

That we think we have found

something doesn’t mean we have, but

though we have failed in the past, we

still might one day succeed.
I watch the small chestnut I found.
Perhaps this time, out of its many pre-

‘vious dashes for the sunlight — per-

haps this time, it will survive to grow
tall.

before they believe, but not to give up
hoping.

ourselves to go further away, but that

 

means more travel time. Just imagine '

the jet lag you would get from travel-
ling to the other side of our galaxy, a
trip of a mere 70,000 years, minimum.
Even if you didn’t have to experience
all of the journey through some miracle
like time-dilation or cryogenic freeze,
everyone on Earth would have to wait
-140,000 years to hear about what you
found. This is not the kind of scientiﬁc
research project that will “get much
funding though if no one alive will ever
beneﬁt from it.

So, we can probably assume that

 

aliens are bound by the same laws of
physics that we are. In that case, I think
it is safe to assume that nobody is trav-
eling hundreds’ or thousand of light
years just to see if anyone is out there.
Does that mean that I think there is
no such thing as extraterrestrial life?

Actually, I think there probably is life‘

out there. Many scientists nowadays are
beginning to agree that life on other
planets may be more probable than we
ever thought. But life still needs the
right conditions to be present. . That
drastically narrows the number of stars
that might have life-harboring planets ,

so if life’s out there, it’s probably very
far away.

It is more likely that we will make
radio contact with another life form one
day than physical contact. Radio signals
are easy and cheap to transmit, unlike
starships. Besides that, our scientists
agree that radio-astronomy is a more
sensible endeavor than interstellar trav-
el, so the alien scientists will probably
agree, too. '

Kris Kissel still tlreams of travelling to
other stars, but he's very ' aware that
they are, in fact, just dreams.

may seem bizarre to contempo-
rize characters originally found in
the “Iliad,” but Ewert claims that
the approach is quite practical:
“lt’s a very ironic, bitter, sardonic
look at life during wartime.”
Like many modem tales of
violence, “Troilus and Cressida”
is a tragic comedy. Shakespeares
characters aren’t sympathetic, heroic or noble,
but simply petty, squabbling opportunists ——
characters that a late 20th century audience can
relate to. “Strangely enough, after World War

War H, modern European history
or 20th century history,” says
Ewert. “I’m doing it because of
the music. The play has this tone
that is deeply ironic and is on a
knife edge all the way through. I
felt I needed something a little
extra to provide further commen-
tary for an audience to make its

way through this ironic sensibility. So what I
have done is added a lot of music from the
‘30s and ‘40s.”

Ewert says that in this way he can provide

another level for the audience to relate to. “It’s
this notion of war, that each side knows all the
moves like a dance. The two never change, but
it’s going to exact its cost eventually.”

Ewert agrees with those who say that the
love story of Troilus and Cressida is the oppo-
site of the Romeo and Juliet tale. “What hap-
pens to them unfortunately is much more real-
istic because ciroumstances change. People’s
ideals, beliefs, vows of constancy and true love
don’t always survive changes in circumstance.
During war time, that’s what happened to
Troilus and Cressida. The two of them vow
etemal love, and there is a hideous change of
circumstance that the two of them aren’t able
to overcome.”

This dark and disturbing performance is
said to put the audience through the wringer.
“It seems like it’s going to be very dark and
difﬁcult to get through,” says Ewert, “but 
for an audience, it’s absolutely exhilarating
because it does take you across the emotional
map. It makes demands of you emotionally
and intellectually that some of the other
Shakespeares don’t make.”

9,999 Mclniclcs and one stunt double just don’t make the grade

“If Natalie
Merchant can have a
successful musical
career without us,”
the remainder of the
10,000 Maniacs
must have been
thinking, “we can

 

« have one without her!”

Unfortlmately, guitarist Robert Buck and
keyboardist Dennis Drew, Merchant’s former
songwriting partners, aren’t comfortable at the
front of the band. So rather than establish a
new, Natalie-free identity for themselves, they
simply got a replacement. —

_On the Maniacs’ newalbum Love Among
the Rains, former
backup musician -
Mary Ramsey steps I
up to the mic as lead
vocalist and does
her best. Her best
isn’t bad. However,
it isn’t especially
good, either.

. R a m s e y
sounds like a less
angst-ridden version
of Paula Cole or Shawn Colvin. She doesn’t
sing with the same emotional intensity as
Merchant, and her voice lacks Melehant’s
vibrant richness. And —— whether it’s the fault
of her performance or the songwriting —
Rarrlsey’s vocals are not integrated well with
the music. The words just sort of hang some-

  

' where above the instrumentals, sounding

  

Jeez, did they really have to stea

more like recitals with background music than
actual songs.

All of the tracks on love Among the
Ruins have the same bland, in—between tempo.
Previous Maniacs albums, especially Our
Time in Eden, featured songs ranging from
slow ballads to up-tempo pop numbers, with
melodies and moods as distinct as this album
is homogeneous.

Love Among the Ruins also lacks the col-
orful instrumentation ‘of the band’s last efforts
with Merchant, such as Eden’s bright horn
section. Inexplicably, Rarnsey’s excellent vio-
lin and viola skills, used to such powerful
effect on Eden, are allowed to fade into the
mix on Ruins. It would have been great to let

. Ramsey develop as
an instrumentalist as
well as a singer —
ﬁddlers such as
Ashley Maclsaac
are in vogue these
days.

The album’s title
 g is supposed to sug-
— love gone wrong
— but there’s noth-
ing extraordinary happening here either.
“Rainy Day” refers to “a day when love came,
came easy like what’s lost now found”; “You
Won’t Find Me There” protests, -“But there’s a
ﬂame that must be farmed.” Wow —— what an
amazingly original analogy.

Most of the songs reminisce about some .

great love that used to be, but is no _more.

Though the" details of those loves differ from

I song to song, their expression is so uniform

that the listener gets the impression that the
Maniacs don’t have a very wide variety of per-
sonal romantic experiences, and perhaps
would be better songwriters if they did.

Then again, maybe it doesn’t matter that
the lyrics are as bland as the rest of the album.
No matter. what the words or melody are,
Ramsey sings them all the same anyway.

V Paul McCartney
 is the man on the
Z ﬂaming pie!

Well, not really.
The title of
McCartney’_s new
album comes from
a particularly silly bit of Beatles mythology. a

John Lennon once claimed that the name
ofthebandwasgiventohiminadrearnbya
man who ﬂew down on a ﬂaming pie and
said, “You are Beatles with an ‘A’ .” Well,
Lemon always was the most pretentious
member of the band, so what do you expect?

But McCartney, perhaps the most down-
to-earth Beatle, manages to keep his head out
of pretentious clouds on this album. It’s just
him, writing simple songs as they come to him
and playing most of the instruments himself,
with a little help ﬁem his friends: Ringo Starr,
Steve Miller, Jeﬂ° Lyrme and George Martin.

Beatles freaks will probably love this
album; its vague, imagery-laden lyrics are

SOUNDBlTE

   
  

similar to those the Beatles produced in their
later years, like those on Sergeant Pepperis
Lonely Hearts Club Band. But you don’t have
to be on acid to ﬁnd meaning in McCartney’s

songs; any mildly introspective person can

read volumes into the lyrics.

The ﬁrst four tracks on Flaming Pie are
great. "The World Tonight,” the ﬁrst U.S. sin-
gle from the album, is a series of stream—of-
consciousness images that somehow connect
in a surreal Beatles way. For example, the line
“I go back so far, I'm in front of me!” makes
no real sense — but it does in the song.
McCartney even said that if Lennon were still
alive and they were writing together, “I think
he would have gone, ‘Okay, leave that one in;
we don’t know what it means, but we know
what it means.”’

“Some Days” is a beautiful song full of
awe at the power love can have over a per-

son’s life; it’s diﬂicult to believe that this song '

was written in the two hours McCartney
claims it took. “If You Warma” is a simple
song with a great musical arrangement, thanks
to the help of Steve Miller. And ‘The Song We
Were Singing” digs right into the souls of
those of us who like to think big thoughts
about the whole world even as we ﬁnd our-
selves returning to our simple daily routines.
The album is well-produced, embodying
the rough, down—and—dirty approach to rock
recording. Taken as a whole, Flaming Pie is a
vast improvement over McCar1ney’s last solo
attempt e— but the ﬁrst four tracks are by far
the best '

Ba [man 1L1

Mr. Freeze, portrayed by a silver
Arnold Schwarzenegger (guess Buddy
Ebsen'wasn’t available), is a jewel thief who
wants to freeze Gotham in his spare time.
And he tries desperately to work the words
“cold”, “freeze” or “chill” into every sen-
tence.

Poison Ivy, played by Uma Thurman
dressed sensuously as a pixie, wants to create
a race of man—eating plants. She is the only
character with any real pizzazz but doesn’t
have much to do besides buddy up with
Freeze.

Theirs is a strange partnership that is
never quite explained: If she helps him
freeze the world, where will her plants exist?

Oh well, the movie doesn’t care, so why
should we?

Then there are the good guys.

George Clooney plays Batman with the
same intensity he once showed as Mrs.
Garrett’s delivery boy on “The Facts of

, Life.”

Throughout the movie, his Batman
smirks and spouts wisecracks like he’s play-
ing pick-up basketball. Forget the brooding
exterior that makes the Dark Knight so
frightening — Clooney as Batman is like Jim
Varney as James Bond.

Chris O’Donnell returns as the frisky,
jittery Robin, who just can’t understand why

a superhero named after a pretty little birdie
isn’t- seen as a pillar of machismo. Alicia
Silverstone makes cupie—doll faces as
Batgirl; no doubt she’d do more, but since
she’s only the niece of butler Alfred and has
absolutely no qualiﬁcations to attain super-
hero status, what else can she do?

As for Alfred hinlself —— well, Michael
Gough does what he can with a script that
takes his character, formerly the lone voice
of sanity in Bruce Wayne’s twisted world,
and tums him into a sappy, doddering old
feel—good father ﬁgure.

Even the action in this movie is a let-
down. Nothing is ever at stake for these peo-
ple, and the ﬁght scenes are so blurry it looks
like the combatants are beating up the cam-
eraman.

Audience reaction on opening night sai
it all about this movie. i

During scenes that tried to be tender or
sentimental, people were actually laughing.
During the cartoonish, special—eﬂ°ects heavy
climax, the fellow behind me actually fell
asleep and started snoring. ,

But he had already paid the price of his
ticket, as will countless other moviegoers

bad Batman and Robin is. So in 18 months,
we’ll surely see the ﬁfth episode in the series.

WNBA: No
dunks, no fans

It’s ﬁnally here.

All the “We Got Next” commer-
cials are done, thank God. The talk is
over, and the time has come for a group
of ambitious women to showcase their
talents to the world. The Women’s
Basketball Association’s players and
coaches are primed to make history.

Last Saturday, they took the first
step. The WNBA’s inaugural game pit-
ted the underdog, New York Liberty,
against the Los Angeles Sparks.

The Liberty outlasted the Sparks
67-57 in front of 14,284 fans, the largest
crowd to ever witness a women’s pro-
fessional basketball game.

Boy, was it a thrill.

With all the tricky layups and neat
three-pointers, I was left wanting more
as the buzzer rang. One girl even tn'ed
to dunk, but was a few inches short, get-
ting stuffed by the net.

Sarcasm?

Yes. I am not a sexist or a close-
rninded, testosterone—popping pig, but
honesty is still the best policy. And hon-
estly, the WNBA stinks.

It isn’t fun to watch. I don’t get a
chill when a Phoenix Mercury player
busts through the lane with a thunder-
ous two-handed layup. I don’t get excit-
ed to see lanky Rebecca Lobo get the
ball in the post and hit a baby hook shot.
And I don’t get excited to watch a
Charlotte Stinger hit a three from
behind the same line high schoolers
shoot

Until this league and sport find a
way to make the game more appealing
to the masses, it will never work.

In this age where political correct-
ness is ideal and where a person’s true
views and ideas are often hidden, I will
be among the few who are proud to
shout to anyone listening that the
WNBA WILL NOT LAST.

All eight teams are in NBA cities,
hoping to draw fans from big brother
NBA. Even their names are similar to
their NBA counterparts. They play in
NBA arenas and hope that the average
NBA fan will be willing to pay up to
$45 for a summer alternative.

Maybe it will work. I hope it does,
so next there will be the WNHL and
Pittsburgh Puffins, then the WMLB
with the Pittsburgh Piratettes. It would
be great.

Sarcasm? Yes.

Pitt’s coach fields calls from
scouts about former center

Zachariah Blott

 

This Wednesday night, the NBA Draft will be back to
generate off-season excitement for the basketball communi-

Each year, talented college players — like blue—chippers
Tim Duncan of Wake Forest and Keith Van Horn of Utah —
are sought after. Some leave college early (or skipping it
completely) for NBA consideration.

And one underclassman who might be selected
Wednesday is Mark Blount, Pitt’s starting center for the bulk
of last season.

Not since center Eric Mobley was drafted 17th overall by
the Milwaukee Bucks in 1994 has a hoopster from Pitt been
chosen, let alone seriously considered for selection. But now,
Blount has a chance to change that.

Some Pitt fans and draft analyzers aren’t sure he’ll be
chosen, but Pitt Head Coach Ralph Wiﬂard thinks Blount will
deﬁnitely be an NBA man by Thursday.

“'Ihere’s no question about it,” said Willard, when asked
if Blount would be one of the lucky 58 selections. “He could
go as high as the ﬁrst roun 

Willard has received calls from about 10 or 15 NBA
teams, asking about Blount’s personality, strengths, weak-
nesses and whether or not the 7—footer likes to practice ——
something nearly all draft experts agree the big man will need

  

 

THE PITT NEWS

Willard says Blount is NBA bound

to do a lot of to compete at the pro level.

Blount’s signiﬁcant improvement from his freshman
year to his sophomore year is the strongest facet he has going
for him, according to Willard. In fact, VVillard said he’s never --

ures to be a second-round pick in tonight's raft.

The Pitt News’ guide to the 1997 NBA Draft

 
 



 

Charlotte is buzzing.

Everyone is wondering who it will be.

“fill it be Donna Karan? What about
Georgio Amiani? Oh, and we can’t rule out
the sleeper Versace, now can we?

All these moguls are vying for the
rights to clothe the man of the hour, 6-10
Mr. Everything Tim Duncan. The Demon
Deacon can’t exactly be The Man without
looking sharp, can he?

See, for the past three years, Duncan
has arguably been the best player in college
basketball. He would have been the No. 1
pick in 1995 over Joe Smith if he had left
after his sophomore season, and the 76ers
couldn’t have passed up on the former
swimmer last year, even with Allen Iverson
and his posse out there.

Duncan kept his word and stayed in
school, something that has escaped too

many of the players whose lives will
change tonight. Duncan, along with Keith
Van Horn of Utah, are the only sure lottery
picks that honored their scholarships to the
fullest.

This year’s headliners — Dimcan, Van
Horn and Ron Mercer — have all been in
the spotlight for quite some time. But after
the trio, the draft drops off frighteningly
quick in some people’s eyes.

Here’s a breakdown of what one Strat-
o—Matic Draft Lottery looks like, but don’t
take my word for it. No one but the Draft
Gods know what will happen.

1. San Antonio — Tim Duncan:
Wake Forest 6-10, 248 C

Duncan gives Robinson the help on
the frontline that he has been searching for
ever since he got off the ship. Will Perdue
may have the biggest shoes in the league,
but he doesn’t fill them very well.

2. Philadelphia -—- Ron Mercer:
Kentucky e7, 203 G

Before last year, when the 76ers made
Allen Iverson the top dawg, and in 1995,
when Jeny Stackhouse was available at
No. 3, they ranked as some of the worst
draft minds in the league. Sharone Wright
in 1994, Shawn Bradley in 1993, enough
said.

New head coach Larry Brown can’t
go wrong with the second pick. Or can he?

Mercer is a proven college star, but
that doesn’t mean the NBA will be like the
bluegrass for the sophomore. He can rim
the ﬂoor and jump with the best of them,
but he may have come out a bit too early.

3. Boston —— Keith Van Hom: Utah
6-9, 225 F

VV1th the trade of Center Dino Radja to
Philadelphia, the Celtics are in need of a
big man, and Van Horn ﬁts right in. New
coach Rick Pitino probably would have
liked to get Mercer with this pick, but they
just don’t have the luck. What do you

Thorton, Dome and the NHL’s
future debut at the Civic Arena

Some of the hopeful prospects at the
Civic Arena for this weekend’s NHL Entry
Draft only had to wait a few minutes before
theirnamewascalledahershadtowait
hours.

“It’s a very long process,” explained
David Wright of the Sault Saiiite Marie
Greyhounds, who wasn’t drafted. “It’s just a
waiting game. You can’t go by the draft
rankings.”

Wight, along with 9,100 fans, watched
as the Boston Bniins selected Joe Thornton
ﬁrst overall. Strength, size and scoring are

. the key words for Thornton — who is 6’4”,

200pounds aridamiedwithaslickpassing
game. He’ll be one of the Boston’s vital
blocks for a team in the midst of rebuilding.

“Joe’s a nice kid,” said Bruins Head
Coach Pat Burns. “He’s a talented player.
The scouts know more about him than I do,
so I’ll have to see himon the ice.”

The Penguins had to wait until No. 17,
when they drafted Robert Dome of
Slovakia. Considered one of ‘the sleeper
picks this year, the 17-year-old split last sea-
son between Long Beach and Las Vegas in
theIHL,iegistering 14goa1sand 13 assists
in 56 games.

“He’s a couple years away from becorn-
ingasolidNI-ILer,andhe’scomingtothe
most talented team in the league,” said
Dome’s coach at Las Vegas, Chris
McSore1y. “He doesn’t miss the opportimity
togotothenet,andhe’snotafraidtoscoie.”

“He reminds you of Kevin Stevens,”
said Ed Jolmston, assistant general manager
of the Penguins. ‘The fans will love him.

  

He’s got speed, and he’s as strong as a
horse.”

The Penguin staff was high on Dome,
and the new Penguin retumed the favor.

“Oh, I’m y!” Dome said “It’s
beﬁttingtimttheycalledmyname,agreat
feeling. I want to contribute to the team.
Playing with guys like Jagr and Francis, I’m
goingtotiy andleam fioni them.”

Other ﬁrst—round draftees shared
Dome’s enthusiasm. Sergei Samsonov,
drafted eighth overall, was pleased to be

1

going to the Bruins. . T
“It’s a team with a lot of tradition, a
goodteamtobedraﬁedby,”hesaid
Samsonov spent last season with the
Detroit Vipers ofthe IHL, scoring 64 points
in 73 games. Despite playing second ﬁddle
to'I‘horntoninthisyear’sdraft,he’sbeen
toutedasoneofthetoparnateuissince 1995.
But Samsonov admitted that he didri’t feel a

lot of pressure on him “Little English,” he .

lsaid, srriiling. "I‘hat’s been my only prob-
em.”

'llie only question plaguing most of
Saturday’s draft picks is simple: Are they
ready to enter the NHL? 9

~ Eric Brewer took a realistic stance.

‘Tmnotsmewhattoexpectofthe
NHL,” admitted Brewer, drafted ﬁfth over-
all by the New York Islanders. “It won’t take
longtoﬁguieoutmyrankingontheteam,
butlactuallyexpecttospendnextseason
withmyjuniorteam[PrinceGeorgeofthe
Western Hockey League] 'I‘nere’s too much
talent in New York’s farm system”

Even though the day was capped off by
a _-diaftpartyatDonzi’sintlieStiip, it’s

to the grind for the NHL’s future stars
this summer.

Blount

had a player improve as much as Blount
has, and NBA scouts have been impressed
with his learning.

What else does Willard feel will bode
well for Blount as the draft approaches?

“He has a good grasp of the game
offensively,” said Willard. “He can pass,
shoot out to 17 feet and has good ball-han-
dling abilities.”

Also, Blount increased his stock with
a good showing at a camp for prospects
held in Chicago in the spring.

Another positive factor about Blount
is, of course, the ex-Panther’s height. Only
three other prospects eligible for the draft

 

mom PAGE 11

are as tall as Blount.

_ Unfortunately, he has only 230 pounds
to his trim frame. Willard says that NBA
scouts are hoping Blount will add some
strength and weight in the otf-season. Last
summer, Blount put on 10 to 15 pounds to
bolster his inside presence in the Big East.

All things considered, if Blount is
selected, he will most likely be taken rather
late in the two-round draft. Willard,
though, is convinced his former center will
not go unclaimed.

“Based on the information I’m getting
from the [NBA] teams,” said Willard,
‘‘he’ll be chosen.”

Head Coach M.L. Carr to the Lottery as

Van Horn will complement Eric

Wrlliarns and Antoine Walker up front ,

immediately. The Celtic faithful will hope
Van Horn has some leftover magic from the
WAC Tournament to help turn around the
Celt’s 15-67 record from last year, the worst
in club history.

Colorado, and the Nuggets can use all of the '

help from the crowd they can get.

6. Boston — Adonal  Colgate
6-1 I, 215 F

Yes, the Celtics already took a big man
with the third pick But Van Horn and
Walker can play the three—spot, and Foyle
gives Boston an immediate defensive pres-
ence. He needs work on the offensive end,
but Pitino and Co. surely will put points on
the board, so the education for the Colgate
Kid will be fast.

7. New Jersey — Tim Thomas:
Vilmavu 6-9, 235 F

Thomas may lack some of the tough- S

ness that it takes to last in the NBA, but
playing in New Jersey can make anyone
tough. And Nets’ coach John Calipari can
develop talent, one thing that Thomas isn’t
lacking. Considering Jayson Williams is

The Warriors need a player that will
live up to the team’s name, and Cato has
proven over the past few months that-he’s a
perfect ﬁt. He can block shots and rebound,

but it will take a little time and effortto pol- .

ish some rusty oﬂensive skills.

9.Toronlo—Tror.yMcGrody:Mt.'

Zion H.S. es, 200 F ,

McGrady can jump out of the gym, and
he also -brings to the ﬂoor some serious
range with his outside shot. But he has only
showed this on the high school level.

There is only one Kevin Gamett; don’t

' expect McGrady to have such a monster

impact early.

The league’s other famous high school
superstar, Kobe Bryant, showed great
promise with the Lakers last year, but his
tlneeairballsintheplayoffsagainstUtah
showed that maybe he’s not the manchild
everyone painted him to be. McGrady will
make tons of money, most of it from Adidas,
but he will need the tutelage of Isiah
Thomas, Stoudamire and Marcus Camby.

—He’s a big question mark, but ﬁts well into
