Finest Student Produced Play

Pitt Players will produce “Dark of‘ the Moon” tomor-
row, Friday, and Saturday of this week at 8:30 p.m. in

Stephen Foster Memorial.

The play, directed by Harvey

Pope, will star Shelia Elias, Col. ’55, as Barbara Allen; Ben
Tater, Col. ’55, as John the witch boy; Ed Bachman, Col.
’58, as the preacher; and Jack Ingram, Bus. Ad. ’56, as

Uncle Smelique.

“Dark of the Moon,” which is based on one of the 280
versions of the old ballad, “Barbara Allen,” takes place on
Old Baldy Mountain in Kentucky. John the witch boy falls
in love with and marries Barbara Allen, the beautiful human
girl. If Barbara can remain faithful to John for one year
he will become a human being, however two of John’s Witch
girl friends try to break up his marriage.

Revival Hits Peak 4

The climax is reached in the
revival scene when Barbara Allen’s
faithfulness is tested.

The mountain play is being
presented for the second time
because of over 500 requests for
its repeat. A cast of 27 will be
in the 1955 production. Many
others have helped to build the
mountain, prepare five different
sets, and work out the lighting
effects necessary for the super-
stitious and supernatural char-
acter of the play.

Another unique touch for the
Players’ production will be two
fiddles, an accordion, and a guitar
which provide authentic mountain
music. Lloyd Welden, Jr., is tech-
nical director. -

Costumes Unique

Even costuming will be unusual
—-bare feet, witch girl dresses, and
a copper—colored wig for Barbarg
Allen. Tickets can be bought for
$1 at the student desk or the box
office. Block tickets of 20 or more
will be sold for 75 cents.

Pope has a special interest in
this forthcoming production
since he attended the University
of Alabama with William Bur-
ney, co-author of the play. The
two became friends while Pope
.was student director for the
Alabama thespians.

lBurney’s first play, produced at
Alabama, was similar to" “Dark of
the Moon” in that it was a tale of
witchcraft, death and reincarna-
tion. According to Pope, “Produc-
ing ‘Dark of the Moon’ held a per-
sonal satisfaction to me due to my
friendship with Burney and my
interest in his work.” He describes
Burney as a “typical artist, sen-
sitive, poetic and rather with-
drawn.”

Called Finest Play

In 1949.the play was presented
to a full house at Stephen Foster
M e m o r i a 1 auditorium. Florence
Fisher Parry, Press columnist,
wrote that‘ “ ‘Dark of the Moon’
was one of the finest non-profes-

sional performances I have ever,

seen.” Mel Silver and Gloria
Brodie, who played the leads in
1949, will return to view this last
effort of Pitt Players for this year.
Pope decide to stage the play
again this year as a challenge.
“The students want to live up to
the fine reputation that. was
built,for- the play which is gen-

He stated that he particularly
liked “Dark of the Moon” because
it has an ability to associate its
emotions with the audiences yet
it is far enough removed in_its
mountain setting to provide a fan-
tasy for the enjoyment of‘ the
viewers.

Calls for Devotion

‘To School, Says All Are Honored

By BARBARA

CHERINGTON '

“A Greater Honor” exists besides the formal recognition
of excellence in scholarship,” Dr. Paul H. Masoner, Dean of
the School of Education, told students who gathered in the
Commons room on Apr. 21 for Scholar’s Day.

“The real importance of the honor due you for your

accomplishments can never b

e completely exempliﬁed by

medals, prizes, certiﬁcates,” Dr. Masoner said. The real im-
portance lies in the accomplishments that are already yours
in the achievements that your record promises for the fu-

ture.” ..

Encouraging “devotion to edu-
cation as a bulwark to democ-
racy,” Dr. Masoner suggested
that “what you have done-
what you shall do——these are
your honors.” He quoted Peri-
cles as commending “not merely
laying down your life, but a
sacrifice far more diﬂicult-—
that you shall at all costs to
yourself, develop the individual
within you, and make the ut-
most of him, training every in-
stinct, every innate faculty, un-
til in every share, you can make
to your state and your fellow
men the contribution of the best
and soundest judgment and the
best and greatest achievement.”

“We need students who will
take on responsibilities, as Edu-
cation is personal satisfaction,
sometimes not recognized by
friends,” Dr. Masoner said.

First Place In
Tech Tourney

By GORDON CLOVVNEY

Pitt’s "women debaters walked
off with second place honors in the
ﬁfth annual Carnegie Tech Tar-
tan Tournament held Saturday on
Tech’s Campus. They debated on
the topic, “Resolved: that the
United States should extend diplo-
matic recognization to the com-

, munist government of Red China.,

The women placed higher
than the Pitt Men’s Varsity De-
bating squad that copped third
place.

What makes their placing in this
tournament so notable, is the fact
that the women, debating on the
novice level all season, were com-
peting against 14 avarsity teams,
representing the states of Penn-
sylvania, West- Virginia, Ohio, and
New» York. They were also the
only women’s team to win a place.

Scored '78 Points -

In ﬁnishing second to West Vir-
ginia, the women scored a total
of 78 points, ﬁnishing with a record
of six wins and two losses._

The aﬂirmative team of Harriet
Laby and Vera Krokonko, both
C. ’57, defeated Dickinson, J uniata,
and Hiram, losing to Heidelberg,
for a three and one record.

The negative team of Sandy
Johnston, C. ’57, and Bernice Beg-
ler, Ed. ’56, also ﬁnished with a
3-1 record, beating Dickinson,
Otterbein, and Heidelberg (last
year’s winner), losing only to
Westminster.

The team received a plaque,
denoting second place, at» the
Carnegie Union on ' Saturday
evening. .

This was the ﬁnal tournament
of the year for the women, who,
under the direction of Coach Mil-
dred Ann Ditty, participated in 96
intercollegiate debates, and eleven
major tournaments this year.

Recognition for All

As each’ term draws to a close at the University of Pitts-
burgh assemblies convene to honor students who have ex-
hibited high degrees of leadership in scholarship and extra
curricular activities. Scholars’ Day was held last Friday
in honor of those students who have excelled in scholarship.
Tap day will be held next week in honor of those who have
shown excellence in extra curricular activities as well as
scholarship. _ -

To be honored on either of these days or at any other
time is a creditable achievement and somewhat enlighten-
ing in this world of complaint and unrest. But only a rela-
tively small percentage of students are singled out for tap-
ping by honorary organizations. This fact should, however,
instill a measure of personal pride in all students who are
studying and working at the University, a pride born not
only of association but also of doing a job. .

Certainly those fewupon whom the honors are con-
ferred can and should be justiﬁably proud of their accomp-
lishments. But the award is only the beginning. For by
accepting their awards, these men and women have become
acknowledged leaders from whom much will be expected.
Their job is only starting, for henceforth they will be looked
upon as responsible, diligent, industrious people who can
not only do a job but do it well.

For the members of the faculty and administration the
honoring of these students signiﬁes a job well done and a
product of which they can be proud. For the University
it means the realization of the type of individual which
the school was founded to produce. '

And for you who are not called up on the stage it
means a realization that you too are a part of the Univer-
sity‘which will graduate these students. It means that you,
upon graduation, will carry with you the honors which
have been conferred upon these few. ,

In schools, as in every other phase of life, it is only
through the efforts of all that the leaders are recognized.
And it is through this recognition thatyou will be recog-
nized as the graduate of a university which ranks high
among the top educational institutions of the country.

Independents
By‘ Irv Rotlunan
Although Spring festival is sponsored by the

- undergraduate body of the University, it is without

a doubt run_ by the fraternities and sororities.
Independents who far exceed the number of Greek
letter people on campus have little say and less
to do in the annual festival program.

This issue was brought into proper perspective
at last Friday’s student-faculty 
discussion’ led by John Huston,
history lecturer. Greek letter
men and_ independents discussed
the role of the non-afﬁliated per-
son during festival week.

While the fraternity men ar-
gued that their organizations are
the only one on campus strong
enough to sponsor shows and
booths at Carnival, others felt 
that keener competition provided by independents
would raise the level of performance during car-
nival week.

Competition Increased

Added groups would increase the competition
for scarce places on the lawn which the Greeks
now hold as inherent for themselves. Four inde-
pendent groups submitted applications for refresh-
ment booths and were limited to two. Two had no
place in the program. .

But some of the fraternity men argued that
they needed the shows in order to pay for racers
and ﬂoats. The annual increment, they continued,
was an all-important thing. So Carnival and festi-
val take on a purely commercial air and the same
groups run it year after year. It is generally agreed
that the shows do not improve—-“But we give what
the students want,” one man argued.

The fallacy lies in that Pittites have no choice
as to what shows are presented. They must accept
what is given because shows are not written until
after campus positions have been chosen for the
acts. And as one professor later remarked, “I don’t
mind something risque if it is presented well.”
Standards Same—Low

But while annual themes change, the show

Rhesus Means Victory

  

  

  

   

' F t’   I 
standard remains the same. Instead of improving,
it remains stagnant, or worse, it declines. It is
like the defendant ivho pleaded before the judge
that he had ten years’ driving experience when
actually he had only one repeated nine times. Mr.
Huston had been a judge one year for the shows.
He considered it painful to watch some of them.

But what groups would sponsor the type Of
show that could raise the level of festival? Pitt
Players might well perform a theater in-the-round
or a _modern drama under the tents; Pitt Band, or

portions of it, could put on a concert; Glee Club’

has a deﬁnite place in such a program.
It is true that these groups don’t have the
ﬁnances to splurge as do the fraternity—sorority

' contingents. That is why many students are not

among them. But as an incentive to such groups
to take a place on the Pitt midway, the committee
’could initiate differentiated or graduate payment
for individual organizations, as suggested at the
meeting by Leonard Kirsch, Col. ’56.

They would be required to pay only a per-
centage of their gate or lower site rents. Arrange-
ments could be worked out so that few organiza-
tions need not carry the ﬁnancial burden, however.
Independents Important .

It is important that such a plan be effected, that
the independents take the step toward active par-
ticipation in Spring festival. After all, there are
little more than 1400 Greek letter men and women
among the undergraduate body and more than
5600 registered. '

The added competition might require advance
auditions in order to determine which shows will
be permitted. There’s no reason why such shouldn’t

be done. I The least it can do is improve the caliber “

of the" performances and bring them up from high
school level to college standards. _

With independents participating whose need is
not for the maintenance of houses, or bi—weekly
parties, the festival might someday lose even its
purely commercial air. Instead of raising money
for individual purposes—sometimes ’ selﬁsh———we

might do as Allegheny College does with its proﬁts.‘

Money is put into a special fund established to bring
foreign students to their university for study.

By Paul Harrison

Back in 1797, Jean B. Aude-
bert, a French naturalist, spent
a good portion of his time study-
ing the wildlife_of India. Dur-
ing his travels, he found a spe-
cies of buff-colored monkeys in
northern India and named them
Rhesus. When
a s k e d what
the w o r d
meant, Aude-
bert said it
had no mean-
ing at all.

Now, some
158 years after
the founder of
th ese monk-
eys, the name
Rhesus does
mean some-
thing. For without these monk-
eys, polio would not have been
conquered by Dr. Jonas Salk.

It is with the aid of the kid-
neys of these monkeys that Dr.
Salk produced the vaccine that
is scheduled to save humans from
crippling polio.

, Actually the monkeys do have
a name. As a matter of fact they
have many names. They are of
the Indian macaque family bear-
ing the biological name of ma-

 

caca mullatta, but are referred to
more familiarly by English
speaking peoples as the Bengal
macaca. The native Hindus of
India, however, call them the
Bandar.

Range Throughout Asia

_ The monkeys are distributed
abundantly throughout northern
India and have-been found as far
south as Bombay and as far
north as the Province of Kuing
Chow in China.- They live in
troops of considerable size in the
jungle or low forest and very
often in rocky places.

Curious Chinese observations
extracted from the “Chinese
Gazetteer” in reference’ to this
species, which is often called by
the Chinese, the Hainan Rock-
Monkey, included an anecdote
from a column entitled “She-
Show” (Notes on Animals) which
stated that the monkey has no
stomach but digests its food by
jumping about.

A physical rundown on thé
Rhesus monkey ﬁnds them with
a thick set body with powerful
limbs, a face long and narrow
with the muzzel somewhat pro-
jecting, eyes rather oval and yel-
lowish, brown ears, large and
sparsely haired, nails rather

claw-like and the entire body
covered with long strands of
buff-brown colored hair.

The average length of the
males is 22 inches with a tail ap-
proximately half the length of
the body. The female is between
16 to 18 inches in length with a
tail of seven‘ to eight inches.
Monkeys Antisocial

As for being social, it is a
very quarrelsome species, per-
petually screaming and ﬁghting
amongst each other. The male is

the dominant sex of the Rhesus

and the female seems to be happy
with the situation, although it has
been noted that she takes a ter-
rible beating fromher mate.

Through 1953 the National
Foundation for Infantile Paraly-
sis imported 17,500 of the little
animals and in 1954 they arrived
in the U.S. by plane at the aver-
age of 2000 to 3000 a month.

Now that Salk’s vaccine. has
been proven the U.S. has signed
a new contract which will bring
30,000 Rhesus monkeys by July
to innoculate American children.

Audebert may have no mean-
ing for the word but the Ameri-
can meaning is fast becoming
“conqueror of polio.”

Letters to the Iiditor   

Politics Praised

Editor, the Pitt News
Dear Sir:

During the last part of March,

the University participated in a
full-fledged political campaign.
It progressed in the accepted
manner, with speeches, charges,
counter-charges, campaign liter-
ature, -and most of the other
necessary props scaled to the
possibilities of our University. It
was part of a game played to
the rugged rules of political poli-
tics. Now the campaign stage of
the game is over and the student

u

 

leaders for the next year select-
ed. The campaign was success-
ful in arousing student interest,
at least to the extent of an in-
creased turnout at the polls.
Now the second stage of the
game is beginningylthat of full-
ﬁlling the promises made during
the campaign. We can safely say
that many of the goals will not
be fulﬁlled. But the winning
coalition has promised “that an
honest and sincere attempt will
be made.to accomplish the pro-
gram.” In my opinion, that is all
that can be asked for. The real
power of the student governing
bodies is severely /limited by
stringent Ad-ministration con-

‘ .*
. \ '

  

trols.

But they do have the power to
ask questions, to speak in the
interest of their constituents,
and to perform those functions
given them by the Administra-
tion faithfully. The student lead-
ers must not fear to oppose this
Administration when it acts in
detriment to the students or to
support it when the opposite is
true. They must serve as the
voice of the student body. If they

‘do this, the second stage of the

game will _be as well-played as
the ﬁrst. As a member of the
Pitt party, I conﬁdently hope it
will be.

Yours truly,

George J. Arth, Jr. ,

, LOVE IN REVERSE

They were at‘the campus swimming pool; She was standing on the
diving board—- lithe, young, vibrant. He came swimming over. “Hey,”
he called, climbing up on the board, “was it you who made that dive
a minute ago?” * ’

She nodded-lithe, young, vibrant.

. “Whew!” he whistled. “That was some dive! A back jackknife two
and a half twist full gainer swan. Where did you learn to dive
like that?” '~ .

“I fell off the board,” she explained. .2

“Oh,” he said. He looked at her-—lithe, young, vibrant. “Let’s go
steady,” he said.

“But I don’t know anything about you,” she said.

“What’s there to know?” he said. “I’m a typical American college
man—young, healthy, and broke.” ~ .

“That’s good enough for me,” she said, “for I am not interested in
money. I am a girl of simple tastes—lithe, young, vibrant.”

“Dad!” he whispered. ‘

“Crazy!” she breathed. A  _ ,

Their lips met: Their arms twined. They‘ fell oﬁ‘ the board.

“If you only knew,” he said later, as he appliedartiﬁcial respira-
tion, ‘fhow 1ong;I have been looking for a lithe, young, vibrant girl of
simpk tastes, for though my heart is largevand full of love, my purse
is lean and meagre. My cruel father sends me an allowance barely
large enough to support life. So I have been looking high and low for
a girl of simpletastes.”

“Search no more,” she said. “My tastes are simple; my wants are

few. Just take me riding in a‘ long, sleek, new yellow convertible,
and I am content.”
‘ “Goodbye,” he said and ran away as fast as his chubby little legs
could carry him, for he knew this girl was not for the likes of him.
He had neither convertible nor hardtop, nor the moneyto buy one,
nor the means to get the money, short of picking up his stingy father
by theankles and shaking him till his wallet fell out. No, there was
nothing for it except to forget this girl. “ ,

But lying on his pallet at the dormitory, he could not get her
out of his mind and ﬁnally he knew that whatever the expense, he
had to have her-lithe, young, vibrant.

S6 he sold a few things—his textbooks, his overcoat, his hi-Y pin, I

his roommate’s truss—and soon he had accumulated a goodly sum. He
went to aplace that sold automobiles. “How much does it cost,” he
said, “to buy a yellow convertible automobile?” .
The man told him. He collapsed in a gibberingrheap.
After a while he stirred and shambled home. But on the way he
assed a place with a big sign that said: RENT A CAR-DRIVE
OURSELF. Hope came into our hero’s eyes. He went inside. “How

‘much does it cost,” he said, “to rent a yellow convertible automobile?” ‘

“Ten dollars a day, plus seven cents a mile,” said the man. ,
“Done and done,” said our hero, and soon he drove away in a long,

sleek, new, yellow ,convertible.

“Oh, goody!” said the lithe, young, vibrant girl when she saw the
car. “This suits my simple tastes to a T. Come, let us speed over
rollin highways and through bosky dells.” , '

An away they went. They drove north, they drove south, they
drove fast, they drove slow, the drove east, they drove west,’ they
drove anddrove and drove and, nally, tired but happy, they parked
high on a windswept hill.

“Philip Morris?’ he said. ‘

“Yum, yum!” she said.

They lit up. She snuggled against him. .{‘You know,” he said, “you
are like a Philip Morris--mild and fresh and relaxing.”

“But there is a big difference between me and Philip Morris,”
saidlslgcla. ‘;They’r<f available in king-size and regular, and I am only
avai a e n regu ar.

They laughed. They kissed. He screamed.

“What is it, dear man?” cried she, alarmed.

“The speedometer,” he said. “I just noticed. We put on 200 miles I

ltoiéight, and this car costs seven cents a mile, and I have only $14
e . ’

“But that’s exactly enoug _,” she said. .

“Yes,” he said, “but we still have to drive home, and that will put
a lot more miles on the car. Where will: I get the money to pay
for that?” V - \

“Gee, I don’t know,” said she. .

. “Me neither,” he said glumly. He started the motor and backed
out of the parking place.

“Hey, 1ook!” said the girl. “The speedometer doesn't move when
you’re backing up.” , . ‘

He looked. It was true. Mileage only registered when the car was
moving forward-not in reverse. “Eureka!” he said. “That’s it!”

“Do you mean:-” said she. _

“Exactly!” said he. “I Wlll drive home in reverse. Then no more
miles will register and I'll have enough money to pay!”

“I_th1nk that’s a George idea!” she cried, and she was right. Be-
cause today our hero is in the county jail where food, clothes, and
lodging are provided free of charge, and his allowance is piling up
fast. By the time his sentence is ended, he should have enough to
take his glrl out riding again.

year.

The Lewismen will be definite
underdogs against the” hard—hit—

Lewis pointed out, “These kids
can beat almost anybody on a

against the Mounties will be either
senior Don Miller or sophomore
Carl Lindstrom.

men meet Duquesne in a playoff
match. Both teams are expected

Scoring honors in the Greater
Pittsburgh League rested with the
Blue and Gold who, along with
the Mountaineers 01' West Vir-

ﬁfteen shooters. Tom Shepard,
team captain, placed second with
a season average of 282 followed
by teammates James Cleary, who
had a 277 averagelor fifth place,
James Flynn, who shot 273 for

The Panther rifiemen will close
their indoor season by firing a
return match with Geneva at the
stadium range. Geneva has ex-
pressed a desire to join the
Greater Pittsburgh Rifle League,
so this match could be a prelude
of future competition with the
Covies. In their first meeting
earlier this season, the Panthers

In Return Engagement Today

West Virginia, a tennis squad
that has always been good but
not quite good enough to beat the
Panthers, will be trying to end
their one-match jinx by sending
the Pittites to their second
straight defeat when the Mounties
tangle with the local squad this
afternoon at two o’elock at Mellon

taineers hosted the Panther net-
ters and bowed to them after a
tough battle by a 5-4 score. Last

year when the West Virginians
met the Pittites the score in both

matches was also 5-4 with the
Panthers on top. Today WVU will

be hoping to overcome the one

margin in their favor.

Last Saturday the Panthers drop-

What young people are doing of General Electric

 

Young manager
handles finances
for building of
$5,000,000 plant

In the next ten years, the demand for General
Electric industrial heating equipment will
double, To meet this demand, a giant new
plant (model at right) is being built at
Shelbyville, Indiana.

The plant will cost $5,000,000, and the
man responsible for handling ﬁnances for
the entire job is 32-year-old R. E. Fetter.

Fetter’s job is important, responsible

Dick Fetter’s work as Financial Manager of
the Department. began long before General
Electric started building the plant. He and
his group first had to estimate probable op-
erating costs and predict whether the plant
would be proﬁtable.

Now, during construction, Fetter’s chief
concern is keeping track of all the expenses
on this multimillion-dollar project. When
the plant is completed, he will set up a
complete ﬁnancial section and manage
everything from tax, cost, and general ac»
counting to payrolls, budgets and measure-
ments, and internal auditine.

25,000 coﬂege graduates at General Electric

This is a big job. Fetter was readied for it
in a careful step-by-step program of devel-
opment. Like Fetter, each of the 25,000 col-
lege-graduate employees is given his chance
to grow, to ﬁnd the work he does best, and
to realize his full potential. For General
Electric has long believed this: When young,
fresh minds are given freedom to make prog-
ress, everybody beneﬁts—-the individual, the
company, and the country.

     

 

  

DICK FETTER joined G.E. in 1947 after
receiving a B.S. from Bucknell Uni-
versity, and serving 32 months in the
Air Corps. At G.E. he completed the
Business Training Course, class of ’49.

 A Trip 9
To HiiAcres

By DAVE MAZEB
Sports Editor

 

The sports fortunes of the University athletic program
vacillate continually and while the reason is varied, it's not
often that the blame is placed with the Pitt alumni.

Over the years the former lettermen and alumni, who
have maintained an interest in Pitt sports, have kept up a
ﬂow of ﬁnancial as well as spiritual aid.

No one exempliﬁes this strong feeling better than Roy
Carnegie McKenna. A trustee of the University since 1934 and a
man who graduated in 1903 when we were still called the Western
University of Pennsylvania, McKenna has become an institution.

Recently, his name reached prominence because of the get-
togethers he sponsors each spring for former lettermen and the
present foobtall squad at the completion of the spring drills.

This past Saturday, after the intrasquad battle, the sixth annual

of these affairs took place at McKenna’s home near
Latrobe.

X To say that his home is an ideal place for the
gathering of the old and new clan, is an under-
statement.

The estate, called Hi Acres and very aptly
named, is set back about a mile from the main
highway atop a typical Western Pennsylvania
mountain.

After a slight delay for a sprinkling of rain,
a charcoal—broiled steak dinner was served on a
patio.

Many high school stars, who were present at the intrasquad
tussle, were*invited to the gathering and the move looked to be a
good recruiting measure as the prospects got a chance to mix with
the past and present Panther greats.

McKenna

Conversations about the tremendous victories of the Pop Warner
era, Jock Sutherland era, and the such dominated, with the old—tim-
ers as the leading convincers.

After the discussions ran out and everyone had either renewed

-or made the acquaintance of Mr. McKenna, lettermen wound their

way home and the present footballers started a much—deserved four
month rest.

Ohio Relays;

  

T hinclads at Philly Meet Friday

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

Under the ﬂying cleats of the
world’s greatest middle distance
runner — Arnie Sowell — Coach
Carl Olson’s cinder crew captured
a ﬁrst and two seconds in the 13th
renewal 'of the Ohio Relays at
Columbus last weekend.

Now, the thinclads train their
sights on the Penn Relays at
Philadelphia this Friday and Sat-
urday. Regarded as a potential
winner, besides Sowell, is Alan
Gunderson
two—mile run.

Sowell put on a tremendous
one-man exhibition and was
cheered time after time by the
appreciative spectators as he con-
tinually made up deﬁcits against
the‘opposition to give his team-
mates the lead in the clashes to the
tape. g

In the distance medley relay,
Sowell received ‘the baton and ran
the three-quarter mile in 2:58 to
make up a deﬁcit of ten yards and

§ give anchor man Alan Gunderson

a good lead but the usually reli-
able Gunderson faltered on the
last lap of his mile to ﬁnish second
by 20-yards with a time of 10:14.5
to Michigan’s 10:09.5.

The Blue and Gold’s mile relay
team of Ed Saunders, Bill Green,
Joe Dudas, and Sowell again
ﬁnished second to Michigan by a
slim margin of 1/10 a second——-
3214.7 to 3:14.8. Confronted with
another ten—yard deﬁcit as he took
the baton, Sowell ran the quarter
in a phenomenal 46.7, but this was
not quite enough as he was nipped
by a hair at the ﬁnish.

The Jungle Cat’s first place in
the sprint medley. relay was
registered in a record time of 3:23
which eclipsed the previous record"
by 6.5 seconds. Saunders got off
to a good start and Dave Peays
held his own when Sowell, run-
ning in the third spot, covered

Gridders Combine
For 20-point Total
In Squad Tilt, 14-6

The Panther golfers, owning a
disappointing 1-2-1 record, will
attempt to reverse. a 7-2 setback

The Panther footballers scored
almost as many points winding UP
spring drills last Saturday as they
did in any one game ‘all last
season. The most the gridders
could manageat any one time last
year was 21, against Navy and
Nebraska, but this past weekend
scored 20 in the intra-squad game
——-combining both teams’ scores,
of course.

In splitting these 20 points
among the 22 gridders, the Gold
team came out on top of the Blue,
14-6. The Gold outﬁt, under the
quarterbacking of southpaw Dar-

« rell Lewis, came from behind to

score both their TD’s in the second
half; one on a pass to end John

Paluck and the other on a one-
yard plunge by right halfback Lou
Cimarolli.

The only score for the Blues
came via the air with quarterback
Corny Salvaterra pitching a long
heave to end Bob Rosborough in
the far corner of the endzone.

, Among those who showed ex-
ceptionally well for next year’s
Panthers were fullbacks Bob
Grier and Ralph Jelic. Fine per-
formances were turned in by
junior halfbacks Corky Cost, Nick
Passodelis, and soph Jim Theo-
dore also.

On the line, junior Vince Scor- ,

sone seemed to be in on every
play from his guard post. End
Joe Walton was a constant men-
ace to the quarterbacks with his
rushing while co-captains Harold
Hunter and John Cenci stood out
at guard and center, respectively.

tie.

In the J un-iata match last Thurs-
day, a lost ball caused a weird
dispute and resulted in an un-
settled golf match. With the score
deadlocked 4-4, Jim Zoccola hit a
ball on the 18th hole which could
not be found.

Although two players and a
caddy said the ball went into a
dam, Zoccola insisted that it was
buried in the soggy fairway and
that he should not be penalized.
The rhubarb was submitted to the
club’s rules committee.

Cornell University‘Finding Answer
  For Veterans’ Social Life Problem

By BETTE SKENDER :

(Editor’s Note: This is the fourth in a series of articles to better
acquaint the student body with Student Unions.)

“Of all the male students now in college, it is estimated
that more than half are war veterans, going back to school,
under the G.I. Bill. They are mostly in their twenties, some‘
are married, and all are going to college to work and not to

Providing a social life for these men in proving a bigger
job for college authorities than simply making available a
dance floor. name band, and moon;
One of the first changes to be
noticed on today’s campus is that
not quite so many men are turn-
ing out for football or other

major sports.
In setting up an

league,’ college officials have found
that their schedules can never be
as rigid as in pre-war days——time

erence. »
Filled Up

Colleges everywhere are now:
operating at capacity and the dif—j
is finding 

ficulty in recreation
enough leaders and facilities. ,

At Willard Straight Hall, Cor-
nell University Student Union,
a small, but experienced, staff
directs student activities. Every
afternoon or evening, one or
more of the 13 student commit-
tees meets to plan programs.

Some of the regular activities
held are: semi-monthly bridge
parties for wives of graduate stu-
dents; dance instruction classes
for men, and public forum and
panel discussions on “European-
Education.” These activities are
planned primarily for the veteran.

Students Plan

All of these events are planned
and carried through by student
-committee members who are try-
ing to have the student body get
the most out of college.

Veterans at Cornell have taken
an increasingly active part in
their own organization, The Vet-
erans’ Committee of Williard
Straight Hall. Its primary respon-
sibility is to serve as the liason
between the Veteran’s Administra-
tionand the veteran students. It
is a vital student group on campus
because it takes an active part in
attempting to solve the vets’ prob-
lems in all areas—ecor_1omic, hous-
ing, academic,iand social.

In addition, at Willard
Straight meals, lounges, reading
room.s, and informal recreational
facilities for student use are
provided. '

The Intercollege Bridge Tour-
nament is one of the several very
successful attempts to bring more
or less formal competition to the
indoor social games of bridge,

tennis, billiards, and pocket bil-
liards.

Against the background of
such more or less “de-empha-
sized” recreation, the main busi-
ness of the American college is
going at a. more strenuous pace
than perhaps ever before in our
history.

From his report, it would seem
that the veteran is most certainly
not going to ‘college just for the
“fun of it.” When spare hours do
appear now and then, he will wel-
come them like any other young
man, but for recreation he wants
