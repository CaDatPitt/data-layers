Muslim
students
evaluate
identity

Amy Friedenberger
Assistant News Editor

After the World Trade Center fell,
the Pentagon burned and the debris
settled, Adel Mahjoub didn’t fully
grasp the situation, but he knew
things were going to change.

‘While still a child in elementary
school, Mahjoub’s parents told him
to be subtle about his religion when
around others, to avoid parading
his beliefs.

"‘A lot of people didn’t take the
time to understand what Islam
was about,” Mahjoub said. “So our
parents told us to keep calm at all
times, even if people got heated
toward us.”

Pitt sophomore Mahjoub and
his classmate Louie Al—Hashimi are
part of the generation of Muslims
that grew up after 9/11. Al—Hashimi
is president of the Muslim Student
Association, and Mahjoub is the vice
president. They found themselves
coping with how their religion was
viewed in the world. At times, they
found their situation unsettling, but
now they are optimistic that Islam
will thrive in the U.S.

Mahjoub said that his parents
tried to be vague when informing
him of what happened. They didn’t

want him to think that his religion '

played a role in the terrorist at-
tacks. _

He said as he advanced into mid-
dle school and high school, more in-
formation unraveled about Islamic
militant groups and more focus was
placed on Islamic extremists as the
enemy of the U.S.

Al—Hashimi had a similar reac-
tion when he heard the news of the
terrorist attacks

War veterans return home for education

Michael Macagnone
Editor in Chief

Sophomore Danjohnson thinks
some of the skills from his last
job translate easily to his eco-

nomics major. Firing mortars, ‘

after all, involves plenty of cal-
culations.

And until he retired from
active duty in 2009, that was
much of What the 25-year-old
did. Working as a weapons s_er—
geant for the U.S. Special Forces,
he traveled much of Southeast
Asia and, along withasmall
team, went to help train other
countries’ militaries to better
protect themselves.

Now he has returned to the

years older than his counter-
parts, and with more travel in
his background than most.

“My main goal was never to
travel. I’m extremely grateful
and all that, and I wouldn’t give
up those experiences,” he said.
“Still, staying in one place is
alright.” T,

As of the spring" semester,
Johnson was one of more than

.500 students attending Pitt with

government support through
the GI Bill, which subsidizes the
"education ofveterans, said Ann
Rairigh, the director of Pitt’s
Office of Veterans Services.
The highest level of benefits —
full in—state tuition — requires
three years of active duty. Rai-
righ said that it isn’t a govern-
ment handout. I

“That’s a lot of your life to
sacrifice to the military,” she
said. '

The number of veterans re_-
ceiving government benefits
at Pitt has doubled from about
200 in the past two years since
Pitt created Rair_igh’s office and
the new GI Bill went into effect.
The bill also allows veterans
to pass along their benefits to
their spouses or children’s edu-
cations.

Many of the veterans live with
another shadow of their military
career —— the possibility of be-
ing called back into duty. Quite a
few of the Pitt students studying
under the GI Bill are still in the
reserves or National Guard and
could still be deployed abroad.

Rairigh said that many of the
veterans haye had multiple de-
ployments, sometimes while at
school. The Iraq and Afghanistan
wars have affected hundreds of

thousands of young Americans,
_many of whom have returned

to seek education at home. Her

deployed early in the semester,
or are enrolled in certain classes
that cannot be completed once

be able to make up the work, but

lab, there’s no shot,” she said.
“Some students will be here

ments.”.

Pitt installs GPS
system to track
campus shuttles‘

Gwenn Barney
Senior Staff Writer

No need to peer down the streets,
impatiently searching for a blue
and white bus — a new tracking
system installed in Pitt’s shuttle
systems allows students to track
the GPS location of the shuttles
online and through a smartphone
app.

Pitt’s Parking, Transportation
and Services department installed
GPS devices, which will allow stu-
dents to track their desired shuttles
in real time, on all Pitt shuttles on
June 15. Smartphone owners can
use the free “RouteShot” applica-
tion, but students will also be able
to view their shuttles’ estimated
arrival times at pittshutt1e.com

The GPS system, spearheaded
by Student Government Board
member Lauren jentleson, was
installed in the Pitt vehicles for
a one—time cost of $10,000. The
tracker lists 13 campus shuttles.
Jentleson said on Thursday that
she didn’t know where the money
came from for the GPS system, and
Kevin Sheehy, director of Parking,
Transportation and Services at Pitt
was not immediately available for
comment on Thursday.

“The department felt that with
the advanced technology available,

it was important for the University _

to provide the best and most accu-
rate information for our students,”
Sheehy said on Tuesday. “We un-
derstand that time is a valuable
commodity to every student, and
helping them reach their destina-

tion in a timely manner would be

a beneﬁt.”

Although Pitt provides a pam-
phlet of the times that the shuttles
run, the shuttles don’t often adhere
to it. But now, students will see

_,e

where the shuttles are in real time,
since the electronic tracking device
in each shuttle’s dashboard trans-
mits a signal to a cellular device’s
operating system, which allows
tracking information to appear on
a digital map.

On the map, each shuttle’s loca-
tion is represented by a different
colored circle. Shuttles in motion
show a white arrow in the center
of the circle, and a red square
displayed means the shuttle is
stopped. The website and app also
provide time estimates for when
the shuttle will reach each stop on
its route.

“It’s deﬁnitely a nice luxury for
students to have,” Jentleson said.
“Hopefully itwill alleviate a lot of
frustrations students have with the
shuttle systems.” A ‘

Some of these frustrations in-
clude waiting long periods of time
for shuttles to arrive, waiting in the
rain or waiting while it’s dark.

Sophomore Kami Rodgers
hopes the new GPS system will
help her avoid a repeat of a situa-
tion she encountered this week.

Rodger said that while wait-
ing in Tuesday’s downpour for a
shuttle, she found none in sight.
With no way to determine when
the next shuttle might arrive, Rod-
gers and her roommate came to
the conclusion that the only way
to reach their classes on time was
to trudge down to lower campus
from Panther Hall in the rain.

“It would be nice [to ‘use the
GPS] whenever it’s raining,” Rod-
gers said. “I won’t have to wait out-
side or be running to catch it.”

Sophomore Cheﬁea Kon has
already incorporated a check of
Pitt’s GPS system into her daily
routine.

“I use it all the time,” Kon said.

_ we had a sense that things were go-
ing to change,” Al—Hashimi said. ‘

“Being a kid and knowing that
things weren’t going to be the same,
it’s tough to deal with.”

In the United States, a country
historically hailed for embracing
diverse cultures and religions, 4.5
million Muslims in America ex-
perienced a sudden tumult in the
aftermath of 9/11: opposition. to
mosques, suggestions to burn the
Quran and racial proﬁling aimed at
people following Islam.

“If people don’t take a little time
to get to know Islam, all they’re go-
ing to get is the image of a violent
Islam,” Al-Hashiini said. “There
are some people that just want to
accept Islam ‘as violence because
they don’t want to take the time to
learn, but some peoplejust don’t
know better.”

The Pew Research Center inter-
viewed Muslim—Americans for an
August 2011 publication. The Cen-
ter found that they reported similar
levels of alienation and anger since
its 2007 survey.

Pitt students Louie Al—Hashimi and Adel Mahjoub said they never felt
like they were singled out growing up.

With nearly .10 years since the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a majority
of Muslim—Americans reported that
it has become more difficult to be a
Muslim in the U.S. Negative views
about Muslims, discrimination
and prejudice or misconceptions
about Islam are problems facing
Muslims in the country today, Mus-
lims polled in the survey said.

Mohammed Bamyeh, a Pitt so-
ciology professor with Islam as a
ﬁeld of interest, said that the events
of 9/ 11 drew unwanted negative at-
tention to Muslims. The terrorist
attacks made the U.S. react strongly

against a previously unfamiliar re- '

ligion, he said.

“Since Sept. 11, Muslims have
been on the defense, trying to de-
fend the meaning of their religion
against the extremist interpreta-
tions, but also defend themselves
against the civil rights kinds of
violations,” Bamyeh said.

According to a 2009 publication
from David Harris, Pitt law schoo1’s
associate dean for research, law
enforcement has “actively sought

partnerships with Muslim com-_
munities in the U.S.” with the goal
of persuading “members of these
communities to share information
about possible extremist activity.”

Al—Hashimi and Mahjoub said
that they never felt like they were
singled out by ‘ people, but they
think that was mostly because they
are Syrian. Because they don’t look
Arab, most people didn’t immedi-
ately associate them with Islam. ‘

Both men’s parents were born in
_Syria, then later moved to the U.S.
Their parents follow Islamic law
to a moderate degree. Al-Hasirni’s
mother wears a hijab, or veil, the
only outward indication that his
family is Muslim. ‘

But Mahjoub, as one of the only i

two people practicing Islam at his
high school, didn’t completely feel
like he belonged. P

‘ “Was I singled out? In away, but ’

nobody ever pointed it out to me.-
But I just felt it,” Mahjoub said.

lims found themselves answering »-

three while going to school. Most other
nontraditional students, though, don’t
have careers that can take them to the
far corners of the world on a few weeks’
notice.

“Deployments don’t come at the end
of the term,” she said, noting that be-
cause of the several months’ prepara-
tion and standing down necessary after
deployment, students can miss much
more than a year of class:

For some, however, their army days

are not yet over. Maj. Patrick Hofmannf
has been in the army for 15 years, since
enlisting in 1996.A student at Pitt’s,
Graduate School of Public and Interna-

tional Affairs, Hofmann is, working on
a master’s in Public and International
Affairs, majoring in security and intel-

 

phisticated intelligence equipment like
the U.S. military does, they have infor-
mants in a network Hofmann wanted to
work to help make better.

“For him to share that with me, you
do have to build up a rapport with the
person,” he said. “You really have to be-
come friends with the person.”

He communicated mostly through an
interpreter, but spoke some limited Ara-
bic while working to build up a relation-

ship with the other soldier. About three '

months into his deployment, he gave]as—
sem a football as a sign of friendship.
That kind of experience gives veterans
likeretired Maj. Ed Kobeski a different
perspective on topics in the classroom.

ligence studies. ,

His, studies at Pitt are not so much
of a change as they are a’ break. Once
he graduates from Pitt, he’ll go‘ to an
army school in Kansas for more training
before he continues work as an intel-
ligence officer. _ .

Since receiving his commission in
2003 — he graduated from the Univer-
sity of'Tampa with a degree in political
science — Hofmann has worked in Bel-
gium; South Korea; Washington, D.C.;
Kansas, and on one deployment to Iraq.
Luckily, he said, he did not have any run-
ins with IEDs or resistance fighters while
working to train Iraqi troops during his
deployment in the 2007 troop surge.

Besides age (Hofmann is 34), one ma-
jor difference between veterans and stu-
dents. who have not served in the military
is experience. ' '

Hofmann said that part of his time
in the army has -taught him to deal with
difficult people and work well in teams,
both tasks learned in situations many
find trying. It took him several weeks to
build up trust with an Iraqi border police
lieutenant namedjassem, his intelligence
counterpart in the Iraqi unit.

Although the Iraqis do not have so-

rest of his army experiences.

“One day I’m jumping out of an air-
plane, the next day I’m in an office doing
paperwork,”,he said. “Some of the guys

I here — nothing against them — come

in and they’ve been a businessman for
eight years.” '

Over the course of a 14-year career in
the army, Kobeski went to Iraq, South
Korea, Kuwait, Egypt and Qatar over the
course of four deployments, first as a
chemical officer, then in psychological
operations. .

“I stayed in a little longer that I want-
ed to,” Kobeski said. “I thought I would
go career, but after four deployments, I

i kind of threw that away.” _

Kobeski said he saw a definite shift
over the course of the past decade in
the way soldiers viewed their deploy-
ments —— and the military itself. Like
he, they often think they will stay in for
a full two decades, before resigning to a
certain “solemn acceptance” of multiple

_ deployments or leaving the army for the

reserves, as he did. — _

“On the whole, I’m happy to be a civil-
ian for the most part,” he said, “Except
for one weekend a month, I guess that’s
good enough for me.” ﬂ

“It all goes back to those terrorists on

cause they gave us that image and put that

When Al—Hashimi and Mahjoub came to
Pitt, they joined the Muslim Student Associa-
tion. They said that the organization strives to
serve the interests of Muslim students while

about Islam. The group’s membership has
increased each year.

“I just feel like 9/11 brought Islam to the
forefront, for good and for bad,” Al—Hashimi
said. “Some people became,‘honest'ly, curious

Al—Hashimi and Mahjoub said that, for

them, Islam is a lifestyle and sornething with

which they strongly identify, regardless of

Bamyeh said that like most young Muslims
that go from concealing a religion to proudly
associating with it, they became tired ofvei1-

People hate and love things for no

. good reason. Sometimes they’re

activities, like baseball, and other
times they’re ideas, like lust.

But since the Enlightenment
and the rise of liberal thought,
imposing your tastes on others

has been frowned upon. After all,‘

we have to respect other people’s

-opinions about how to live, right?

My thoughts on baseball and lust

are not necessarily right, just my

own.
Nevertheless, Iwrite today about
one belief that is objectively correct.

Having pancakes for dinner is an

outrage — a gluttonous activity

symbolic of societal degradation.
You might be taken aback by this

assertion. People love pancakes for

dinner. The Glee Club sponsors pan-

cake dinners all the time, and they ‘

routinely sell out to throngs of stu-
dents and parents. Volunteer ﬁre-
houses would likely have to resort
to garden hoses and Tonka trucks
without them. , V

Yet while these dinners are in-
deed economically beneﬁcial, I’m
concerned not with matters of
money but rather with matters of
the mind and heart. I believe that
pancake dinners epitomize a de-
moralization of the work ethic that
built this country, as well as -a com-
pletely hedonistic lifestyle.

First, about the work ethic: I
don’t know one person who com-
pletes a pancake dinner and then
says, “I will now seize the evening!”

Edison would still be selling candy

The butter and syrup, some-
times interrupted by even more

decadent chocolate chips, recall not '
hardy cornbread or simple canned a

in the hours before her revolution:
the clams, breads and wines that
the idle nobility ate for pleasure as
the proletariat slaved away. Marie
Antoinette’s oft—attributed line, “Let
them eat cake,” might as well have
been, “Let them eat a stack of ﬂap-
jacks drizzled in blueberry sauce.”

In addition to their cruel deca-
dence, pancakes scientiﬁcally make
you sleepy. They have a moderately
high glycemic index, meaning that
your body needs a lot of energy to

FOREPLAY ON WORDS

Oral sex should be reciprocal

Leah Trimble
Columnist

College students seem to have for-_

gotten something: Sex is about
equality.

Lately my girlfriends keep tell-
ing me that their men don’t think
about reciprocating after receiving a
blovvjob. They leave their girlfriends
hanging, and sometimes don’t even
initiate foreplay before sex.

Equally distressingly, I’ve heard
of guys giving oral sex to girls and
then not getting anything in return.
Regardless of gender, we should all
compromise in the bedroom.

I’ve encountered this situation
before, too, and it turns out I’rn inthe
majority: An article in Cosmopolitan
reports that 62 percent of its readers
speciﬁcally desire more oral sex.

Why is this occurring? In the
article, Linda Banner, Ph.D., ex-
plains that maybe we’re not letting
men know that we want it, and that
“young males can be selﬁsh in bed,
focusing on their own desires.”

I personally think that the for-
mer reason is crap. Men, do you want
oral pleasure when you’re with your
partner? If you answered yes, then
you can be certain that we would say
yes to the same question.

Do we have to explicitly ask for a
little foreplay? Has it really come to
this? I always thought that the saying
“give a little, get a little” counted for
something. It’s common courtesy to
reciprocate — not just every once
in a while when you’re feeling gen-
erous.

After hearing about my friends’

issues, I decided to investigate the 4

problem and go right to the source:

explain that the vagina was, for lack

fore dirtier than the male genitalia.
He told me’ that it was “exposed”_
all the time, not like a penis that is
“covered.” '
Another guy brought up the
“ever-so-popular pubic hair argu-
ment, mentioning that it was just
disgusting and that he thought every
girl should be completely shaven or
waxed. ‘ '

Finally, there’s the equally preva-
lent smell complaint. The guy that
brought this up gave the most hor-
rible cringing face.

“Most girls,” he said, “give off a
bad aroma and taste terrible.”

Here’s what'I have to say in re-
turn: These are only superﬁcially
sound arguments; most men are
over-exaggerating to excuse lazi-
ness and selﬁshness. The “vagina
being open” comment, for instance,
is frankly absurd. The area we touch
on you is just as exposed.

For those of you worried about
pubic hair: You should put that
anxiety to use on your own nether
region. I’ve known no more than 10
men in my life that actually shave
everywhere. For those of you that
keep clean, we appreciate it, just as
you appreciate it from us. But please,
please, don’t think you can even
begin to complain about pubic hair
until you handle your own grooming
problems.

And lastly, about the smell: I can-

not tell you that a smelly private area
doesn’t exist — I’ve never had my
nose that close to one. What I can tell
you is that those people that regu-
larly give women oral sex usually
claim to like or not notice a smell. I
will also say that good hygiene is nice
for everyone, both men and women,
to practice.

In any case, I’m going to let you

energy you could normally devote
to doing things like walking the dog
or curing cancer.

I’m not saying a‘ sleepy dinner is
a bad thing; steak and potatoes put
any good man or woman to sleep
without any perilous lapse in moral-
ity. But pancake dinners normally
start and ﬁnish around the second
hour of the local evening news. You
essentially sacriﬁce seven hours of
potentially productive nighttime
activities to TV because of your din-
ing choice.

It is easy to see how this deg-

. radation of work ethic brought

on by self-indulgence and sleepy
sickness leads to shallow pleasure
seeking. First we eat pancakes for
dinner. Then we decide that yoga
pants and dirty T—shirts are good
enough to wear everywhere because
it’s just more comfortable. Finally,
we decide all we need to do is the
absolute minimum in our studies.
Economic life comes grinding to a
halt and a whole generation stud-
ies less and spends ﬁve hours a day
watchingTV. ,

You say this is all hogwash?
Liberal/conservative/anarchist

: propaganda? Well, our economy

is in a.rut and studies show we are
underachieving. According to The
Nielsen Company, we actually watch
ﬁve hours and 13 minutes of TV a
day. i .

Sadly, there is little empirical
research to back up my claim that
pancakes lead to terrible societ-
ies. Not even the most exhaustive
Google searches could yield any
data correlating increased ‘obesity
or thievery to increased -pancake
consumption (ﬁnding the addition-
al correlation between the former
factors and social decay is addition-
ally difﬁcult to discern).

er philosophical opening. To get
all of you to join my anti-pancake
crusade, I need to turn it into some

kind of societal beneﬁt equation. ‘

Using an argument that something
is simply not virtuous or not in the
spirit of a good life is not enough;
such a statement must instead be
backed by a connection with poorer
health outcomes, fewer positive re-
lationships or lower educational
‘attainment. Virtue in itself is not
an argument.

To be fair, I am not a philoso-
pher or ethicist, so perhaps I’m be-
ing naive in my understanding of
philosophy. But when our society
changed in the late 18th century and
we decided it was not OK to impose
an idea of -virtue on individuals,

‘ when we began to see civilization
. as mainly just a way to preserve our

rights, the nature'of our arguments
changed.

This was probably for the better,
on the whole. People with unreal-
istically and unhealthily strong an-
tagonisms towards perceived social
evils have much less sway in such

a society, and this stabilizes and -

improves our collective condition.
Yet we lose something —— a simple
statement like “Hard work and hu-
mility are laudable values” becomes
almost too ideological.

Ultimately, I just want to convey
that a virtuous life is one which is
started by breakfast and ﬁnished
with a dinner that doesn’t turn us
into gluttons. We must be better
than this. I have faith in us. ‘This is

how we can attain the good life and '
g ﬁnd true happiness.

I .suppose if you don’t believe
this, I _can’t force you to. But I’d still
like us all to ﬁnd principles beyond
the simple pursuit of the easy, con-

-venient and shallowly tasty.

Find the good life. I

FOOTBALL

 

Graham to focus on improving

Pitt’s fundamentals ag

Dustin Gabler
Staﬁ” Writer

The Maine football team will
seek’ its first-ever victory over a
Football Bowl Subdivision team
when the Black Bears face Pitt
on Saturday.

Maine, which plays in the
Football Championship Sub-
division —— formerly known
as Division I-AA — is coming
off a 28-13 win over Bryant.
But Maine head coach Jack
Cosgrove said he knowslthat
when the Black Bears kick off
with the Panthers at 1 p.m. at
Heinz Field, the competition
will increase.

“I’ve always felt that in order
for a team of our stature to be
successful against a team like
[Pitt], they have to play bad and
we have to play great,” Cosgrove
said in a teleconference. l

And even though Maine
doesn’t play in the Football

. Bowl Subdivision,, it still has

formidable players that -could
be potential threats to Pitt’s
defense. Senior defensiveback

Trevor Coston led Maine in its 3

firstgame, returning a punt
74 yards for a touchdown and

adding two interceptions. Pitt 2

football head coach Todd Gra-
ham said he is aware of Maine’s
prowess on special teams.

He added that Maine’s senior
quarterback Warren Smith re-
minds him of Pitt backup quar-
terback Trey Anderson.

“He’s a very good ‘opera-

‘ tor,” Graham said at a press

conference on Tuesday. “He’s
quick and a fast read-zone—type
guy.”

Senior running back Push-
aun Brown adds an additional
threat on the ground. Against
Bryant, Brown rushed for 146
yards and two touchdowns.
Graham said that, overall, he
expects the Black Bears to play
aggressively.

“Coach Cosgrove has been
there 19 years. They are very
well coached; I like his style,”

 

The Pitt football team hopes to pick up itslsecond wi

he said. “I’m impressed with
how well—coached they are.
They are very disciplined.”

But the Panthers should
have an advantage on both‘ the
offensive and defensive lines.
Although Maine boasts experi-
ence on both lines, the Black
Bears are undersized compared
to Pitt’s Division I offensive and
defensive linemen.

Pitt will look to execute Gra-
ham’s offense more smoothly
on Saturday. -In the first half
against Buffalo — an eventual
35-16 win for the Panthers --
Pitt scored just seven points.

“If we hit Cameron Saddler,
that’s a walk-off touchdown,”
Graham said of the missed op-

portunities against Buffalo. “If

we hit Devin Street, that’s a
walk-off touchdown, and you’re
at 250 or 300 yards passing.”

After the Buffalo game, red-
shirt junior_ quarterback Tino
Sunseri said that his reads were
right in the, first half, which
he considered positive heading
into the break.

“We were able to go into
halftime really just focusing
on us,” he said. “We came out
in the second half feeling like
ifwe werejust able to focus in,
just ﬁnish plays, we were going
to be able to score points.”

Sunseri and the Panthers
appeared to grow more com-
fortable with the no-huddle

system in the second half, and
they’ll look to improve on that
performance against Maine.
Sunseri ﬁnished the game with
179 passing yards and a touch"-
down.

“It’s just not knowing our
system and trusting it enough,”
Graham said. “In scrimmages
it’s, ‘1, 2, check down,’ and he’s
throwing it; In the game, it’s
just experience in the offense
and what we’re doing.”

Graham added that he wants
to see the Panthers improve
fundamentally in their second
game of the season.

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

WVU, USF
impress in
first week

 

R] Sepich
Staff Writer

The Big East Conference, which
often lacks respect on the grid-
iron, went a perfect 8-0 on oped‘-
ing weekend and combined to
outscore opponents 304-100.
Sure, four of the wins came
against Football Champion-
ship Subdivision opponents,
but the wins over Notre Dame
and Wake Forest still count for
something.

Here are my rankings of
the eight undefeated Big East
teams:

West Virginia — Lightning
shortened the Mountaineers’
34-13 victory over in-state rival
Marshall, but it was enough to
keep West Virginia at the top of
the standings. It took a while for
new head coach Dana Holgorsen’s
offense to get going, but when it
did, quarterback Geno Smith and
his deep core of wide receivers
all looked impressive.

v South Florida — My sleeper
pick to win the conference start;
edits season with one of the up-
sets of the weekend, hanging on
to win at Notre Dame 23-20. The
Bulls made -the most of the Irish’s

ﬁve turnovers, including three in A

the red zone, and quarterback
B.J. Daniels put in a composetl
performance to give Skip Holtz’s
team a win that placed the Bulls
in the top 25 nationally.

Pittsburgh — Head coach Todd
Graham’s debut will be placed
under the “a win is a win” cat-
egory. The Panthers’ new offense
put up a mere seven points in the
first half before running back
Ray Graham exploded in the sec-
ond half to end fears of an upset
to Buffalo. With FCS team Maine
on the schedule this week, it’ll
be hard to judge how good Pitt

MEN’S SOCCER

Pitt set for home opener

   
   

Ryan Samson I Senior Staff Photographer

The Pitt men’s soccer team hasn’t played a regular—season game on campus since 1999.

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

Finally, the Pitt men’s soccer team will have
a true home game. .

The Panthers will play their ﬁrst regular-
season game at Ambrose Urbanic Field Fri-
day when they host Air Force at 7:30 p.m. as
part of the Pitt/ Nike Invitational. They will
conclude the tournament Sunday at 2:30
p.m. with a game against Bowling Green.

The Panthers (1-2-1) haven’t played a
regular-season game on campus since Nov.
4, 1999, when they defeated California (Pa.)
4-1 at Pitt Stadium, nine days before the
stadium’s closure. For more than 10 years,
the men’s and women’s soccer programs
have played off campus, ﬁrst at area high
schools and then at Founders Field in Ches-
wick, Pa.

But now they’re back.

Women’s soccer opened the season at
home on Aug. 19, but the men’s side started
the year with four consecutive road games
— the longest season-opening road trip in
the program’s history. -

After playing six exhibition games at the
complex in the spring andtwo more last
month, Pitt has had time to acclimate it-
_self to the new turf, which, unlike the often
muddy, chewed-up grass of Founders Field,
is synthetic. _ ’

“It allows you to play better soccer,” Pitt
head coach Joe Luxbacher said after the
spring exhibition season. “You can really
use skill more. When you play on a ﬁeld like
Founders, especially late in the season, it’s
muddy and heavy. You can’t play the same
way you do when the surface is good.”

Pitt scored nine goals in its two exhibi-
tion games this August, wins over California
(Pa.) and Marshall.

Meanwhile, Air Force '(1-1-.0) looked po-
tent in its season opener, a 5-2 win at Hous-
ton Baptist. And although Davidson shut out
them out 2-0.in their most recent game, the
Falcons recorded 21 shots — 14 of them in
the second half.

Five different players accounted for Air
Force’s tallies at Houston Baptist.

“They’ve got some dangerous attackers,”
Luxbacher said Sunday. '

. The Panthers, on the other hand, have
been one—dimensional on the score sheet,
as sophomore Nico Wrobel has scored all

three of Pitt’s goals this year. The rest of the A

team has been snake—bitten.

“We just have to ﬁnish and score goals,”
senior Terry Akpua said. “Everything looks
pretty good so far,.the tactics and style of
play-” .

Sunday’s opponent, Bowling Green (2-1-
0), is still riding the high of a historic win
at home two weeks ago. Bowling Green up-
set No. 9 Michigan 2-0 at Cochrane Field.
Freshman midﬁelder Danny Baraldi and
sophomore midﬁelder Ryan Snashall scored
the goals, and sophomore goalkeeper Mi-
chael Wiest earned the shutout in his ﬁrst
collegiate start.

Six players each have one goal for the‘

Falcons this season.

_ “Bowling Green is a very good team,”
Luxbacher said. “They’ll be very tough. We’ll
see them on Friday. We’ll watch them, since
they play before us.”

Bowling Green will play Duquesne, the
fourth team in the invitational, Friday at
5 p.m. The Dukes face Air Force Sunday at
11' a.m., but they won’t play Pitt this week-
end.

Duquesne will return to Oakland next
Friday at 5 p.m. to face the Panthers.

With four road games in the rearview
mirror, Pitt has a travel-friendly schedule
ahead of it. Ten of its ﬁnal 14 games are on
campus. '

The games this weekend mark Pitt’s
second two—game tournament in as many
weeks. The Panthers played in the Duquesne
Invitational last weekend, in which they beat
Stony Brook, 1-0, and tied Valparaiso, 1-1.

Senior defender Shane Flowers said that
the weekend tournaments can test a player’s
endurance early in the season,’ but overtime
g games like Sunday’s improve the team down
the road. _

“It’s tough to have two games on the
weekend,” Flowers said.“Everyone was" still
drained from Friday night. Coming into the
overtime game, it shows you who’s in shape,
shows you who’s not in shape, what people
need to work on when you do get fatigued.
It’s deﬁnitely going to help us out later in

_ the season.” j

he said. “Defense, no penalties and get,

takeaways. We put the ball inijeopardy
three times and lost it once. We only got

one turnover, but we could have gotten -

two. That’s uncharacteristic of how we
want to play defense.” 1

Although Pitt struggled to‘ establish
the running game in the first half against
Buffalo, Ray Graham ran for 201 yards
and found the end zone twice in the sec-
ond half.

Senior transferzach Brown added '

some power to the running game, and
Graham said ‘he was impressed with both
of the tailbacks’ performances.

“If that guy [Ray Graham] hasthat
much [of a hole], he is extremely spe—
cial,” the head coach said. “The other
guy, Zach Brown, impressed me. Hejust

looks like a veteran. It’s called experi; »

ence. Wehave a very dynamic group.”

Defensively, Pitt allowed just three
points in the first half— and 16 points
overall — against Buffalo. But although
the defense seemed to dominate in the
first half, Graham said after the game
that the Panthers seemed to go downhill
defensively after the break.

“There are a lot ofthings defensively
we can get better on,” Graham said on

Tuesday. “Then there was a lull, and we I

were supposed to be up on the receivers,
but we were backed up. There were a lot

‘of mental mistakes down the line.”

Graham said he told the players that
they are “still infants in [the] scheme,”

and that it will take time to completely

master the new system.
“We have to be constantly working
toward knowledge,” he said. “That takes

time. It takes studying, and it takes that '

voluntary extra time to do that.” -
