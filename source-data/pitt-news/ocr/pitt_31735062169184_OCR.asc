Middle East Critic Compares
Past Arab - Israeli Struggles

by ANN DORN

“Unless we see the status qou in the Middle East (the Arab
world and Israel) as unacceptable, we will have another Vietnam.
This was the view of Alfred M. Lilienthal, noted author and critic
of Middle Eastern affairs, as he spoke to the Organization of Arab
Students Tuesday evening. Lilienthal emphasized that the United
States Will face in the Middle East a “struggle in which. We will
be opposed by the Soviet Union and Red China.”

In relating the history of the
Middle Eastern conﬂict, . Lilien-

' ‘ thal stated that the United States

wasn’t originally involved as
deeply as it is now. Even in
1921 when the “overwhelming
sentiment of the liberated Arabs
was that the United States ad-
minister the mandate period,”
the United States was in a self-
imposed isolation and’ the man-
dates went to Great Britain and
France. “We were remotely con-
nected with the political situa-
tion,” said Lilienthal.

It was not until Arab nation-
alism and Jewish nationalism

’ arose in the 1930’s that Ameri-

ca became involved, Lilienthal
pointed out. The world owes an
“indebtedness to Adolf Hitler for
Israel. Lilienthal em-phasized
that Hitler forced Jews to seek
a refuge in Israel. “There is a
great difference between a place
of refuge and a state, a haven
and a home.” The refuges, said
Lilienthal, were interested in a
haven. “The Zionists took advan-
tage of this.”

Lilienthal later warned his au-
dience against the use of the
phrase “Jewish state.” “All Jews
aren’t Zionists and all Zionists
aren't Jews. Keep semantics
clear. Zionism is a political move-
ment that anyone can adher to.
Judaism doesn’t require the po-
litical ethics and goals of Zion-
ism. However, most Jews are
Zionists.”

Lilienthal said that the Zion-
ists, a highly organized group,
urged the partition of,Palestine
«into separate Jewish and Arab
states, a partition that -the Unit-
ed States supported for several
reasons. Zionism, said Lilien-
thal, is a factor, although it is
not the only one. Another is the
importance of politics. “Jews are
situated in certain states that
have a high number of electoral
votes, and this makes “policy
subordinated to vote -getting.”
Lilienthal emphasized that the
United States can’t have foreign
policy built _on the basis of min-
ority groups.

“Humanitariani-sm was also
an important factor,” he said. A
popular opinion was that “the
survivors of Hitler should get
the little state since the Arabs
had all the rest.” Religion, ac-
cording to Lilienthal, was an-
other factor, such as the “bib-
lical fundamentalism that inﬂu-
enced people like Winston

Churchill.” The ﬁnal reason was

liberalism, “the political pennant
of America since 1930.”
Lilienthal stated that both

ALFRED M. LILIENTHAL
Speaks to Arab Students’

Russia and Red China are threat-
ening problems for United States
foreign policy. Russia was also
in agreeemnt with the partition,
but “was willing to sacriﬁce a
period of disfavor from the
Arab world for long-term ad-
vantages. Now Russia and Red
China have emerged as power-
ful in this area. The Arab world
was forced to ally themselves
with Russia on the basis of the
old saying, .‘The enemy of my
enemy is my friend.”’ In other
words, “Russia will enter the
‘back door’ of the Middle East.”

Lilienthal stated that “now
American policy includes main-
taining the status quo, keeping

the peace, and dividing military
gifts evenly. This is not a po-
licy in the American national
interest. We've increased the
tension and brought in Russia
-and Red China Without an-swer-
ing the problem.”

Lilienthal stressed, “A bina-

tional state would have been
better for Israel where the Jews
and the Arabs could have lived
in peace like they had for thou-
sands .of years.” Since ‘both
Arabs and Jews are Sefmites,
they have a common bond, and
Lilienthal recommends to “take
the anti-semitic issue out of the
debate and use“ the semitic
bonds.”

“The element of friction in
the Middle East is Zionism -—
the Jews of Western and East-
ern Europe are the intruders in
Israel. The 850,000 Jews in Is-
me] of Western heritage should
be encouraged to go where they
have more in common with the
culture. This will relieve the
tension.”

Lilienthal suggested a recrea-
tion of the state before the Zion-
ists inﬂuenced it. “The Zionist
state is a threat to peace.”

A solution of the Middle East-’
ern problem, according to Lili-

enthal, wouldyinclude “a res-tor-'

ation of balance in the area,
maintainance" of our security,
funneling economic help into the
area, relieving the world of ten-
sion and bring back good will
to the United tSates.” Lilienthal
strongly emphasized that the
solution “must be in terms of
u-niversalist minds.”

Texas Southern Rioting  
Blamed On ‘Breakdown

Within Communications’  

by MIKE BROURM-AN

The night before he re-
fused to accept induction in-
to the Army, Cassiu Clay
visited the campus of Tex-
as Southern University in
Houston. A passing student
shouted, “Stokely (‘Carmich-
ael), ‘he tell the word to burn
Whitey . . . We want to burn
Whitey.”

Don't do nothing violent.
We're not violent,” answered
Clay.

“This is a rebellion man. They
take you in the Army, they -see
a rebellion,” the student shot
back.

But, the students at Texas
Southern did not wait for the
results of Clay’s scheduled June
trial. Late Tuesday a. sniper, ﬁr-
ing from a dormitory, shot to
death a rookie policeman, pre-
cipitating a four hour pitched
gun battle between students and
police which resulted in three
persons wounded and ended
with 488 students arrested.

Houston Mayor Louis Welch
blamed the violence on a total
breakdown of commuriication be-
tween the students and adminis-
tration at the 7,000 student
school.

“When that happens, you
have anarchy, and that’s What
we had last night,” Welch said
Wednesday.

The mayor then promised to
make a full report to Texas Gov-
ernor John Connally. The Rev.

learning that this -reporter was

tcrview, Dr. Cheever "personally

Marvin Griffin, chairman of the “
board at Texas Southern, also
announced that he would confer
with the governor.

“Once we ﬁnd the students
who precipitated the violence, "
we  get rid of them,” he
added. ‘

ing a SNCC protest meeting. ‘

The police arrested one stu-
dent for carrying a gun. It was
then that the fatal shot was
fired.

The officers retreated amid a
hail of bulets, rocks, and ‘bot-"
tes, and called for reinforce-
merits.

viser to Welch on racial affairfsg
and by SNCC organizer F.’D.
Kirkpatrick (who ‘had establish-
ed a tentative alliance with the

to set up talks with the riot
leaders failed and the police ﬁn“
al-ly stormed the dorms in a
rush during which an estimated
3,000 rounds of amunition were
ﬁred by both sides. ' ' 

Unlike the recent and rela-
tively mild riots at the Univer- "
sity this spring, there were no
cries of police brutality. Kirk-
patrick said that the police “did
the right thing. There was no
police brutality in rounding up
the "students. Considering the
circumstances, the police" were,
reasonable.”

tried to talk to -the rioters but
failed. “I’m no demogogue.'T“

Radio Stations Plan Series 
Discusses Venereal Disease‘...:;ff

Radio station KDKA has
launched .a series of programs
on venereal disease (VD) along
with the other Group W radio
stations. The series will be a
springboard for a nationwide
campaign to enlighten people
about these diseases.

The series will feature lead-
ing health oificials and physi-
cians from universities and lo-
cal, state and federal health
agencies. Many educators and
clergymen will examine and dis-
cuss the physiological, moral, so-
cial and historical aspects of
VD, with emphasis on syphilis.

These experts documented the
alarming rise in the venereal
disease rate during the last dec-
ade, especially among teenagers,
pointing out that during 1964-
65 national incidence of infec-
tious syphilis increased 12.4 per
cent among teenagers. In 1965,

   

the 15 to 19 year old age group‘
was double that for all other
groups combined and the 15 -to
25 year olds accounted for 53.9"’
per cent of all the infectious  ‘
in the country. ‘ H
In discussing the amount of
VD cases that are treated at our}
Health Center, Dr. Douglass S.
Thompson, director of the 
dent Health Service, stated that“ .
they really do not treat many . ’ ‘C,
cases, When asked how they"-f=
deal with this problem, Dr.a--..:  ._
Thompson stated that they havjefffé ’
individual talks with mdividuidt "
students. “’7 "
He continued to say that .;
do not believe it exists in e“ ,
demic proportions among co-
lege students here.” He felt 
psychogenic features were  V
portant in considering the prob-.i.1;>
lem, because “-a lot more study-
dents are concerned and .think’=‘:"
they have VD than actually do’ '
have, it. , . , _ . " ’

nocent Bernard, a roller-skating
stack boy at his father's library,
is infatuated‘ with the temptress,
go-go dancing, off Broadway ac-
tress Barbara Darling (Eliza-
beth Hartman); however, he is
saved in the nick of time by the
pure, good Amy (Karen Black).

The movie is a contemporary
farce. At times it is enjoyable,
however, it all to often seems
to be an adult beach party story.

The go-go music by the Lovin”

Spoonful dates it, Francis Ford
Coppola’s screen play needs as
much help as a sinking ship.
Fortunately this ship has a few
life—boats aboard, its actors.
As the sexy, -seductr/ess Eliza-
beth Hartman plays quite a dif-
ferent role from the good blind
girl in A Patch of Blue or the
mousy, pregnant girl in The
Group, Her portrayal as Bar-
bara Darling has its bright mo-

a moments

ments, especially when she is
dictating her autobiography to
her only true friend, midget
Richard Mudd (Michael Dunn).
Geraldine Page has a few good
in, her ﬁrst purely
comic screen "role, and Rip Torn

is consistently good as the virile

though hypocritical father. Spe-
cial note should be taken of Ju-
lie Harris who is excellent as the
undersexed spinster, and Peter
Kastner, the troubled hero. Kast-
ner has the potential to be a
fine’ actor, however, he needs
better material.

Coppla’s direction is typical of
recent comic ﬁlms: the hero is
mixed up, but free; he runs
around causing traffic jams; and
there is a-slap-stick chase scene
at the end. The actors barely
keep this celluloid disaster aﬂoat.

p.,. 4 _ THE PITT News _. Friday, May 19. 1967

There will be no commencement speaker this year, save for a “few
remarks” by out-going Chancellor David Ku-rtzman. That there should be
.-.--_—.—. no commencement speaker is deplorable, and is absolutely. contrary to a

long’ University tr-adition.

Last year, Dr. H. Guyford Stever, president of Carnegie
of Technology addressed the Class of 1966. The previousyear, Sargent
_ _ _Shriver, then director of the Peace Corps, helped launch University fradu-

ates dnto -the Cold. ‘

No one will deny Chancellor Kurtzman the right to speak at his last,
 commencement as chancellor. He has been not only a fine "Chancellor but
i an ardent advocate of the students’ rights. It is both fitting and proper
, "V that he have the opportunity to address this year’s graduating class. How-
- "ever, we must -also emphasize the importance of allowing the Class of 1967

to hear a famous speaker deal with a significant issue.

But even if one is of the opinion that commencement speakers are
insufferable bores, and merely delay post—ceremony carousing, it is im-
 material. Because commencement speakers represent another aspect of
college life which is not found in the classroom, the dormitory, or on the

' football field, and there appears to be a t-rend at this University which we
believe is quickly depriving students here the benefits of this additional

area of their college years.

This aspect of campus life is not a tangible’ thing and it doesn’t have

 ,  anything to do with grades, teachers, and peprallies.

 It has to do with faculty processions and academic robes and com-
-‘ mencement speakers. It has to do‘ with school traditions and espirt dc

blazers, all as morale builders.
Unfortunately, they may get
them. Morale ‘could become a
very expensive thing.

However, the blame does not
rest with the groups. They have
the right to request funds for
purposes -they feel are valid.
The blame does not rest with
the Allocations Committee,- al-
though their criteria for allocat-
ing funds mighrt bear some pe-
rusal. The ﬁnal responsibility
rests with the Senate. The ‘Sen-
ate watchdog on fund appropria-
tions is either asleep or dead’.

In the two years that this
method of allocation has been
used, the Senate has only sent
back three allocations, for re-
con-siderat-ion. These were all
sent back because no money had
'-been allocated, not because the
Senate t-hought the expenditures
were unjus-t or illegitima-te. Sim-
ply because there seems to be a

lot of money to be allocated,.

and because the money is not
comin-g from their personal pock-
ets, senators, myself included,

sometimes fail to -realize that it
is our -money, and it cannot be
spent indiscriminately. Spending
hundreds on sabres, and cutting
corners on typewriter ribbons is
poor ﬁscal policy. Greater care
must be taken by one and all to
see that the money is allocated
wisely and for the greatest bene-
ﬁt of all.

Player Defends

. , ,
Coach Bemis
Edi-“tor, The Pitt News‘:

I would like to take a mo-
ment to clarify once and for all
the «soccer team's feelings with
regard to their coach, Leo Be-
mis. My name is Bill Zurzola;

. I am a senior fullback with

three lettens to date and, bar-
ring injury, will start again
next year, ‘I cannot -hope to ex-
actly mirror every man’-s opin-
ions, but I know my teammates
and Pitt soccer well enough to
justify my statements.

I wish to discuss three “sit-
uations” protested in a recent
letter to the Pitt News which
rendered Mr. Bemis, and unfair-
ly so, incompetent and negligent
of his coaching duties. These
three are the Michigan State
game, the facilities afforded the
team by the Athletic Depart-
ment, and Bemis’ record and
ability as coach. . ‘

The Michigan State game was
a disaster. -Guy Busch, McBrady,
and Keyes’ ran over the defense
in the second half. I was one of
three injured fullbacks who
played the entire game, who can
testify to McBr~ady’s '-power,
Keyes’ speed, and Bu»sch’s All-
American class. When State
broke the ice after a hard fought
half, power, speed, and class
beat Pitt, not a shortened half
time (If there was one!) or a
shoddy defense. As for getting
up too early——sorry, I ate~break-

‘fast with center fullback Jim

Snyder at 9:30 a.m. before the
11_a.m. brunch. I couldn't have
caught Keyes (9.6 100 yard
clash) with ‘ten hours sleep,
someone elses legs and a good
tailwind! Let’s beat Michigan
State next year and forget last
year, how about it grads?

As for Mr. Carver and our re-
-sources, I offer only mi-sg-ivings.
I remember the new ﬁelds we
were promised as freshmen. I
remember playing the deciding
game of the NCAA champion-
ship playoff year against Buck-
iiell on Kennard Field—down in
the Hill District, on a public
recerat-ion ﬁeld without a blade
of grass and- temporary goal
posts which the natives tore

Letters to the Editor

Henry Steele Commager speaking to them on the role of the urban Uni-

Unfortunately, there also was no Fall ‘Convocation this year, nor
was there an Honors. Convocation, and it must be said that students
have been cheated in this other area of their college lives.

Because there is a mysterious something about processions and robes
and commencement speakers that makes for a certain “romance of learn-
ing,” and a feeling of loyalty to the University. ,

Because there is something gratifying and even inspiring about the
University community gathering together for a Fall -Convocation to hear
the Chancellor report to them on the state of the University.

And when these are lacking there is a certain drabness and color-
lessness that haunts the place, detracting from the overall academic at-
mosphere. No doubt there are those who will chide students who feel this
way for being young and impressionable and having naive predilections for
pomp and circumstance and pageantry. But we can only say that when
else but these few years can we be young and impressionable and awed by

sources to two scholarships
year. I remember getting my
scholarship, and ﬁnding that,
unlike a football sc‘holarshi‘p, I
had to buy my own books. I re-
member taking a campus bus
to Grove City, and get-ting off
there with as much shame as
that with which I left after an-
other humiliating loss. But I
also remember the thrill of the
NCAA playoff two years ‘ago.
‘No coach gets his team a
NCAA berth unless he has some-
thing on the ball. Especially
with no recruiting facilities and
a schedule featuring such schol-
arship -wealthy teams as Michi-
gan State, Penn State, Akron,
West Virginia, and Ohio Univer-
sity. That year Pitt advanced to
a national ranking with teams
such as Navy, Army, Air Force,
and St. Lou:is above them, ‘but
within reach. Last year’s turn-
about didn't come from poor
coaching. It was the same coach
again, with more talent to" play
with talent that beat (9-1) Ohio
Conference Alkron, and ripped
Penn State, 2-1, the last game.
No we didn't have a poor coach
last year in Mr. Bemis. We had
too many playing coaching, and
teams ‘within tfeains. The east-
ern boys vs. the Western boys,
this fraternity against that, one

‘man against another. Factions
beat _PIit-t last year. But they're '

gone now, And after spring ball
I can say they won’t be back
next fall. ’

I don't grudge the author of
the previous letter his disap-
pointment. I know him well and
it's ha-rd for a potential All-
American -to swallow defeat or
be misjudged. But it's easy to
protest and condemn and it's
easier to ﬁnd a scape goat for
all the season's troubles. Mr. Be-
mis isn’t a great coach, perhaps

not a good one——bnt he's a ﬁne

man and he's devoted to the
sport. I’m conﬁdent he’ll do his
-best and so will the team; the

‘ rest, the lion’s share of -the job

is ours. Coaches don't win

games; they ﬁeld the teams.

And the teams win the games.

Cheever-His Role
(Continued from page 1)

When asked about his new
position, to which he was ap-
pointed late last month, Dr.-
Cheever replied, “I think that it
is a very challenging job to be
asked to take -these responsibil-
ities under the new Chancellor.
I am looking forward to serv-
ing as vice chancellor under
him.”

The two immediate problems
he faces are “ﬁnding a new dean
for the Graduate School of,Pub
lic Health and a dean for the
School of Medicine. Another of
our responsibilities is the admi-n-
istration of the regional medical
program planning grant for
Western Pennsylvania (the heart
disease, cancer, and stroke killer
disease program). We are search-
ing for a director for this pro-
gram at the moment.”

A challenge Dr. Cheever is
eager to face is “the develop-
ment of the University Health
Center of Pittsburgh into a po-
tent force for giving leadership

The mitters swept both of
their games this week, and
it will take a duplication of
that effort over the weekend
to keep alive the hopes of an
NCAA ‘bid.

The NCAA selection commit-
tee is scheduled to meetnext
Monday, and only a record of
12-1 is expectedto have /any
chance against the, likes of Ri-
der (22-4), St. Johns (17-3), Vil-
lanova ( 16-4) , Temple (16-2), and
Ithaca (18-5).

That 12-1 mark is contingent
upon a win over St. Francis to-
morrow and a doubleheader
sweep of Penn -State Sunday.
Both meets are on the road.

Penn State is expected to be
the tougher test. The Nittany
Lions are 13-6 and entertain
some hope of receiving a bid
themselves. Last year they
crushed the mitters 9-1 and 15-1
in a twinbill at Forbes Field, and
ten lettermen return from that
squad.

The proverbial “two out light-
ning” struck in both of the Pan-
thers games this week,” once ﬁg-
uratively and once literally.

Clarion led the mitters 5-4

with two out and none on in the"

ninth when, responding to calls

from the bench for some two

out lightning, Tom Beckett lash-
, ed a double into_ the left ﬁeld
I co-rner at Forbes Field.

Dave Welty worked the count
to 3-2, fouled off three pitches,
and then drew a walk. _ ’

Tha-t left it up to Ken -Cooke,
who had three hits but who had
also committed two errors which

. led to three Clarion runs, Cooke
belted the second pitch in=to left
ﬁeld for a single. —

The left ﬁelder picked..up the
ball and tried to throw out Beck-

ctt at home. But the throw sail- ‘~

ed high over the ‘head of the
catcher and went all the way «to
the backstop.
