Cathedral
family of
falcons
grows by 3

Harrison Kaminsky
For The Pitt News

Pittsburgh’s hottest couple, Dor—
othy and E2, have laid their ﬁrst
eggs of the season in their home
located on a ledge of the Cathedral
of Learning.

Dorothy and E2, two peregrine
falcons, became proud parents af-
ter Dorothy laid three new eggs on
March 19 at about 2 a.m. The ledge
on the 40th ﬂoor of the Cathedral
of Learning has hosted a falcon
nest since 2002, with Dorothy as
the sole mother to reside there.

This isn’t the ﬁrst time Doro-
thy has become a parent, but E2
hasn’t been the only man in her
life. Erie, her former mate, disap-
peared in 2007, according to Al-
exandre Gauthier, president of the
Pitt Birding and Ornithology Club.

W Dorothy has laid three eggs
so far this season with E2 as her
mate and has ﬂedged more than
40 chicks since 2002. ‘

On average, peregrines can lay
about three to ﬁve eggs every year.
Dorothy hatched in Wisconsin in
1999 and is '14 years old now. Al-
though hers is a relatively old age
for a peregrine, these falcons re-
mainfertile until the end of their
lives.

During the ﬁrst year of a fal-

con’s life, however, he or she has to

contend with a high rate of mortal-
ity. According to Kate St.John, who

Investigators of the Watergate Scan-
dal revealed only a portion of Presi-

dent Richard Nixon’s infractions to '

the public, a panel of those close to

' the incident told a crowd of about

250 people at the University Club
last night.

“Watergate: Third-Rate Burglary
or Historical Turning Point?,” a pan-
el discussion and Q-and—A presented
by the University Honors College
on Thursday evening, featured a
panel of ﬁve people with special
knowledge of the Watergate events

and their coverage by the media,
including Alexander Butterﬁeld,
the former head of Nixon’s Federal
Aviation Administration; Egil “Bud”
Krogh, head of Nixon’s Special In-
vestigations Unit; Robert Meyers,
a Califomia-based correspondent
for The Washington Post; Tim N af-
tali, former director of the Richard
Nixon Presidential ‘Library and Jill
Wine-Banks, a member of the coun-
sel that prosecuted Nixon.

The Watergate Scandal and sub-
sequent investigation occurred after
ajune 1972 break-in at the Watergate
Hotel — then headquarters for the
Democratic National Committee —

by a group of Nixon associates in
hopes of planting listening devices
and photographing valuable docu-
ments. A federal investigation led
to the discovery of the Nixon ad-
ministration’s involvement in the
break-in, ultimately resulting in the
president announcing his resigna-
tion August 8, 1974.

After David Shribman, executive
editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
and moderator of the event, posed

‘ the question of what the American

public still doesn’t know about the

- investigation, Naftali said only about

5 percent of the information was

' revealed to the general public.

“It doesn’t end. It goeson, and
on and on,” Naftali said.

The infractions, which were re-
corded on tapes that the Supreme
Court forced Nixon to reveal, in-
cluded Nixon telling White House
ofﬁcials how to testify to the FBI,
using the IRS against political en-
emies and “hiring thugs to break the
bones of anti—war demonstrators,”
according to Naftali.

Butterﬁeld attributed these
infractions to Nixon’s overwhelm-
ing sense of paranoia..He said the
president “hated and resented” op-

windows that reﬂect the sky and pose a dan-
gerous threat to the city’s'birds. St.john says,
that unfortunately, 62.5 percent of peregrine
falcons don’t survive past their ﬁrst year of

life, the large majority dying from broken
necks after crashing into windows. So why
would a pair of peregrine falcons pick the
Cathedral of Learning — which has more
than 2,500 windows — as its home?

St.John said the Cathedral’s height pro-
vides locations for high-altitude nests.

“Naturally, peregrines nest on cliffs. If
there weren’t buildings, that’s where they
would be,” St.]ohn said. “They want to have
a place to have a lot of prey to eat. From
the top of the Cathedral of Learning, as you
can imagine, it just looks like an enormous
mesa to them.” i ' '

There are only about 100 peregrines in
all of Pennsylvania. They nearly went extinct
after mass DDT and pesticide use in the U.S.,
but after government regulation and rein-
troduction programs, their numbers are
beginning to grow again. 7

There are only ﬁve other known nests
in Pittsburgh,. all of which are located on
the underside of bridges or in the bridge
architecture. St. Johnsaid the birds assemble
their nests accordingly.

“They don’t use sticks to construct a nest. ,
They create a bowl of gravel. This is for two.
, reasons. One is so that the eggs don’t roll

off thecliff, and the other is so that they can

1 i ‘ seal it up a little bit to keep the eggs warm

during incubation,” she said.

They are also known to be extremely
charismatic and territorial creatures. They
will not allow any other birds near their
nests. In fact, Dorothy once fought off a bald

eagle from coming too close to her eggs, and A

it ﬂew away after taking a beating.‘Cat own-

ers can relax: There is no need to worry about
one of the soon—to-‘hatch chicks swooping
down and taking a precious feline. After all,
Gauthier said, “contrary to popular opinion,
peregrines don’t eat mammals like squirrels
or cats. They actually eat other birds. In
Oakland, this means mostly pigeons.”

And, according to St. John, those birds
had better take heed. -I

“Peregrines are the apex of the falconry
hierarchy and have been used for hunting
for a long time,” she said.

According to St. John, falcons’ hunt-
ing style would not work effectively on the

. ground because they catch their prey in the

air. They are the fastest animals on earth and

can reach speeds of up to 200 mph, which is

almost three times the ‘speed of a cheetah.
Freshman Mason Lester said that every

now and then he watches the live webcam

online, which shows Dorothy and E2’s nest
on the Cathedral.
“It’s pretty neat to get an up-"close view

' of these birds without having toworry about

disturbing them,” Lester said.
_ Gauthier said the early summer months
are ideal for Pitt peregrine falcon fans to

' stream the webcam and keep their eyes on

the Cathedral ledges.

I “Sometime in late May or early June,
Dorothy’s. chicks will take their ﬁrst ﬂights.
This is a great time to watch for peregrines
around the Cathedral, since the chicks will be a

be straying too far from home,” he said. I

position, especially the elite from the north-
east United States, who Nixon called “sons of
b*tches who had it given to them.”

As an example, he cited an instance when
Harvard University President Derek Bok ar-
rived at the White House, and an outraged
Nixon insulted Bok in front of his staff mem-
bers and security detail.

“The guy was paranoid,” Butterﬁeld said.

H formation about the scandal that was revealed

to the public, Wine-Banks said it was sufﬁcient
to launch aﬁill-scale investigation into Nixon’s
involvement in the Watergate Hotel break-in
and subsequent cover—up. In-particular, she
said, the “Rose Mary Stretch” shifted the court
in the prosecution’s favor. ‘ V

The Rose Mary Stretch occurred when
Wine-Banks cross-examined Rose Mary
Woods, Nixon’s secretary, about an 18 1/2
minute gap in a tape recovered from Nixon’s
records. Initially, Woods explained that the
gap was a result of her attempting to answer
a phone while recording the tape. But, after
Wine-Banks succeeded in transferring the
case to the White House for a realistic reen-

actment of the event, it was quickly revealed" '

that Woods’ original claim would’ve been
impossible. '
. Itwas this inconsistency, Wine-Banks said,
that shifted public opinion against Nixon.
“That was the point at which the public
said ‘OK, this was not true,’” Wine-Banks said.

Because of the severity of N ixon’s infrac- .

tions, the panel agreed that Gerald Ford, who
became president after Nixon’s resignation,

missed an opportunity to make a statement
regarding the rule of law when he decided to
pardon the ﬁrst president in American his-
tory to resign.

Naftali said Ford’s decision to pardon
Nixon caused U.S. citizens to believe that his
actions weren’t out of the ordinary for the
president — A level of cynicism Naftali says
is unfounded.

“People can make the argument  to say
Nixon did nothing out of the ordinary,” he said.

But members of the panel did agree about
the positive role of the press in shaping public
opinion, though they downplayed the role of
investigative reporting by Carl Bernstein and
Bob Woodward of The Washington Post as well
as other media outlets.

Although Meyer, who collaborated with V

Bernstein during the reporting, said he didn’t
believe. Woodward and Bernstein broke the
Watergate Scandal themselves, he admitted
that their work helped shape public opinion
and turn it against the guilty Nixon and the
remainder of his administration. _

 “I don’t believe in investigative reporting
— I believe in reporting,” Meyer said. I

Pitt offers us something that -

complete the Internship Prepara-

shop commitment with three short
follow-up appointments involving
resuméreviewand a mock inter-
view through the Ofiice of Career
Development and Placement As-
sistance, you are guaranteed to
have a minimum of one internship
or equivalent opportunity during

your undergraduate years at Pitt.
This is. incredible. We have

agwhole staff of people who are

here to get us internships with
only some basic cooperation and
some simple effort required on our
part. Half the battle of getting an
internship is ﬁnding one, right?
Internships are often regarded
as hugely important aspects of a
resumé, as they involve real-world
experience, mentoring and appli-
cation, which are not always found
in the classroom. This grown-up
job-practice round can point us
in the right direction — toward

things we love — or show us what
we would be absolutely miserable
doing for 4o—plus hours a week for
years on end.

Plus, we all know the impor-
tance of networking. It’s all about
the people you know, and former
colleagues or internship supervi-

-sors might be able to connect you

to their larger web of contacts for
your beneﬁt as you begin an actual

tainly worth consideration. Internships are
supposed to serve as nothing but a beneﬁt
to students, but many times this is not the
case.

Internships are often regarded as oppor-
tunities reserved for those who can afford
them. Considering that the vast majority
of internships are unpaid, we tend not to
consider the money associated with being
the copy girl and official coffee retriever.

For example, an obvious concern lies in
the logistics. You need the proper work-
place attire, resulting in a challenge for
both young men and women alike, as you’ll
probably need to buy a piece of clothing
or two — or seven — to look acceptable.
Then, you have to consider transportation
to the business. This is often easy for Pitt
students: Many interns work downtown,
which we can access by bus for free.

But other internships might require you
to have a car, in which case you need to
consider costs such as gas, parking and the
general wear and tear on your vehicle, as-
suming you have one at your disposal. These
are all examples of money ﬂying from your
bank account while your tireless efforts fail
to put those originally hard-earned dollars
back into it.

A signiﬁcant hidden problem here is the I

opportunity cost associated with the act of
working for free; If I’m interning 12 hours

a week when I could be working a regular
part—time j ob making $8 an hour, the intern-
ship is effectively costing me $96 a week,
or $384 a month. That kind of money can

cover some serious bills and groceries in our I

college-grunge lifestyle, so this networking
opportunity better be worth it.

Another problem associated with in-
terning is the high rate of intern turnover
in companies. Internships are marketed

sending a letter of recommendation, em-
ployers can effectively save the company
money: They reserveentry-level-style posi-
tions for the unpaid interns in exchange for

providing the “experience” students will use

to their advantage in the future.
Of course, our hope as interns is that
someone will offer us a full—time position

based on performance and compatibility -

with the staff. But you can’t help but won-

interning needs to be somethingwe
financially ‘account for from the get-
go, so when theinterning semester

and providing the invaluable experience
supposedly obtained by working alongside

responsibilities. However, onehas to won-
der about the reality of companies taking

advantage of this free labor.
By signing off on requirements such that

the student receives college credit or by

employer’s easy way out.

Despite the issues of intern life, we have
to face the reality here: -Entering the real

Several of Pitt’s teams are looking to make
signiﬁcant strides this weekend, with the
baseball team hoping to break into the top
25 of the national rankings and the softball
team trying to keep up its winning mo-
mentum. ' -

Here’s a quick rundown of all this week-
end’s matchups.

Baseball against Towson

After sweeping Big East rival and de-
fending conference champion St..John’s,
the Panthers (16-6, 3-0 Big East) defeated
Penn State on Wednesday 10-8 and will look
to continue their winning ways as they host

. Towson (13-.9) for a doubleheader Friday

and a single game Saturdayat Charles L.
Cost Field. Players have received accolades

«for their efforts, with both outﬁelder Ste-
phen Vranka and pitcher Matt Wotherspoon
attaining Big East Honor Roll recognition
at the beginning of the week. I

Softball at DePaul

The Pitt softball team (13-13, 2-1 Big East)
had a successful home—opening weekend,
taking two of three games from St. John’s.

conference opponent in DePaul (16-12, 3-0
Big East). Pitcher Alexa Larkin won both
of her starts against St. John’s, recording
a career-high 13 strikeouts in her ﬁrst win
over the Red Storm. Play against the Blue
Demons begins with a Friday doubleheader
and concludes with a noon start Saturday
as the Panthers look to hand DePaul its ﬁrst
conference loss.

Women’s Tennis at Marshall and against
VCU _ . «

The Panther tennis team is currently
riding a season-high four-match winning
streak after defeating local rival Robert
Morris 7-0 Sunday. Looking ahead to the
two matches this weekend, interim head
coach Michaela Kissel-Eddins acknowl-
edges “two great opportunities to play two

6‘ very good teams in VCU and Marshall.” The

Panthers will expect strong performances
from singles players Amanda Wickman and
Karma Parbhu, who blanked their Robert
Morris opponents 6-0, 6-0. Both week-
end matches will take place in Huntington,
W.Va. ‘ ‘

members compete in North Carolina. I

 
  

BARNES BURNER
Dixon contract’

a great move

a for all ,

Nate Barnes
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

After Pitt lost to Wichita State a week ago in
its ﬁrst game of the NCAA tournament, the
team’s fanbase decried the coaching style of
head coach Jamie Dixon. _

“He can’t win in the postseason” and
“His style doesn’t work” were common
complaints. Fans of recent years cannot be
blamed for their thoughts regarding the men’s
basketball program’s lack of success, espe-
cially considering the Big East tournament,
in which the team has won only one game
over the last three tournaments.

Amid speculation of Dixon leaving to take
a j ob at the University of Southern California,
some seemed content to let him go.

And then Dixon received a contract exten-
sion throughthe 2022-2023 season.

Across the country, a little way down the
road from USC, former Pitt coach Ben How-
land spent the past decade coaching at UCLA.
In the time Howland spent there — the same

amount of time Dixon has been head coach at” '

Pitt -- Howland steered the Bruins to three
Final Fours, won 230 games and produced
NBA playerssuch as Kevin Love, Russell West-
brook, Darren Collison and Arron Afflalo.

One of those Final Four years included
a victory over his former assistant, Dixon,
when UCLA defeated Pitt in the Sweet Sixteen
in 2007. In his‘ decade at UCLA, Howland
became the second-winningest coach in the
school’s rich basketball history, trailing only
John Wooden.

UCLA ofﬁcially ﬁred Howland on Monday“

Now, this is not a comparison of two
coaches. This is a comparison of two schools:
the way Pitt handled Dixon’s situation ap-
propriately versus UCLA’s decision based on
a knee-jerk reaction.

Which is good because, believe it or not,

Jamie Dixon is the best this program is go-* 

ing to get. And,Pitt is the bestjamie Dixon is

' going to get, which is why I was never fully

convinced Dixon would actually go to USC.

‘Look at this situation. And look back to
2011, when Dave Wannstedt “resigned” (read:
was forced out) from his duties as head coach,
of the Pitt football team after a 6-6 regular
season.

You have to think that Pitt learned from
that decision and the ensuing chaos that fol-
lowed for the football program.

Mike Haywood was hired, charged witli
domestic violence and ﬁred. ‘“

Freshman running back Rushel Shell, who ac-
cording to the Pittsburgh Post- Gazette is con-

‘isidering transferring, has not formally asked

for his release as of Thursday evening.

The Hopewell, Pa., native, who backed up
the since—departed Ray Graham at the running
back position this past season, ﬁgures to have
the inside track to the starting job should he
decide to stay, after having scored four touch-
downs and rushed for 641 yards in 12 games.
He hasn’t practiced with the Pitt team since
Friday, and according to a statement the Uni-
versity issued late Thursday morning, he has
received the go—ahead to take a leave of absence
of unknown duration.

“Like many college freshmen, Rushel is
working through some challenges right now.
As it is for all members of our team, my most
important concern is his personal well-being,”
head coach Paul Chryst said. “Rushel and his
family have our full support. We are givinghim
time away from football to work through this
situation, but he very much remains a part of
our family on a daily basis.”

When asked for an update about the Shell
situation after practice on Thursday, Chryst,
referred all inquiries back to the press release.

BARNES

then ducked out the back door after another
6-6 season.

Paul Chryst seems to be the savior of the
football program, but in the year between
Wannstedt’s departure and Chryst’s arrival,
the football program suffered through every
minute of the ordeal.

There was no way the basketball program
could endure the same process, especially
while on the verge of entering what will be-
come arguably the best basketball confer-
ence ever assembled: the new-look Atlantic
Coast Conference, complete with Syracuse,
Louisville and Notre Dame.

But don’t get me wrong ——— Dixon isn’t Pitt’s
highest—paid employee because of circum-
stance. As mentioned, Dixon is the best Pitt
can get right now, and the best thing for the
basketball program would be Dixon spend-
ing the next 20-some years coaching here
until he retires.

Think about a Coach K—like legacy.

Dixon’s already won 262 games in his time
as Pitt’s coach, the job he got when Howland
left for UCLA. It’s not unreasonable to think
that, at only 48 years old, Dixon not only has
the ability —— but also the time —— to reac
the 900-win mark. , , ‘

Which, by the way, is in some very rareﬁed
air inhabited by Bobby Knight (902 wins),]im
Boeheim (918) and Mike Krzyzewski (956),
all current members of the Basketball Hall of
Fame. Along his way to this milestone, Dixon

   

:1 Saturday, Pitt men’s hasetball hea coach Jamie Dixon signed a contract exten-

sion that runs through the 2022-2023 season. Bobby Mizia | Assistant Visual Editor

would pass legendary coaches, including
Adolph Rupp, Lefty Driesell and Eddie Sutton.

Speaking of Boeheim, Dixon’s winning
percentage of .658 in the Big East is the high-
est in league history and leaves the Syracuse
coach in second place on said list. Dixon has
also kept his team out of trouble with the
NCAA, avoiding sanctions and violations
that have seemingly become commonplace
at other schools.

And did I mention Dixon owns the highest

winning percentage (.753) in school history? i

As for postseason success, Pitt might not
be the best when it gets there, but few teams
have been better in getting to the postseason
than the Panthers under Dixon. Since 2002,
Pitt is one of only seven teams in the nation

to have qualiﬁed for the Big Dance 11 out of
12 seasons.

Dixon played a heavy role in helping the
Panthers reach that level, and his nine NCAA
tournament appearances /are the most by any
head coach in Pitt’s history.

Does he need to alter his strategy? Yes.
Especially heading into the faster ACC, Dixon
needs to ﬁnd a better way for Pitt to operate
offensively — ideally one that involves more
possessions. 2

But remember, Dixon wins games. So
while there are concerns over Dixon, take
astep back and a deep breath. Dixon is the
coach who can make Pitt the elite basketball
program it has shown that it’s on the verge
of becoming for the past decade. I
