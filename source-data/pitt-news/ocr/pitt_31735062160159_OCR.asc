-Pitt’s entire student body today
was preparing for a tumultuous
reception of General of the Armies
Douglas MacArthur, who will land
on the Allegheny tomordow. He
will wade in around noon.

A MacArthur aide denied the
trip had political implications. He
said the renowned general is com-
ing here to enroll his son in the
highly-touted Pitt ROTC unit.
MacArthur was a student here be-
fore the Democrats entered office.
He will speak to the Stray Greeks
and others.

Dan Purdy, head of the Younger
Republicans and 1A in the draft,
heads a reception coinmittee com-
posed of illustrious members of
his fraternity and Jean Sunnder-
man (Sc. 1-9604), IF Queen.

In an interview Purdy, who will
sit beside Jean, said’:

‘‘It’s great for the fraternity.”

Commenting on the General’s
impending visit, Purdy, who stood
at attention, revealed that a plot
to sabotage the General’s plane
was nipped in the bud. When the
entire corps of cadets is drawn up
for review as MacArthur’s plane
passes over at noon tomorrow, a
group of leftist Democrats had
planned to line up as an honorary

in the direction of the General’s

s,  

By GEORGE KABAL
Racing Expert
Student leaders were jubiliant over University adminis-
tration’s aproval of our campus political organizations affiliat-
ed with mapor political parties. It is reported that “at least
two and possibly three’ other political groups here will soon

ask for recognition, which includesé

the right to hold campus rallies
for candidates in the November
presidential election. ,
Administration spokesmen said
that groups so far recognized in-
cluded “Students for Taft,” “Mid-
dle-aged Democrats,” “I Like Ike,”
and “I Love Lovett.” The last
named is reputed to be the'ﬁrst
chapter in America to come out in

‘ favor of the Secretary of Defense.

, “Students for Taft,” allegedly
has 100 members, according to a
clean of men’s ofﬁce source.
DENIES CONNECTION ,

Smallest group numerically is
Middle—Aged Democrats, reported
to have one member. Dri Denton
Beal, director of student publica-
tions, is acting chairman of the
new group. “We are short on
numbers but long on spirit,” said
Chairman Beal.

The three political clubs report-
edly seeking University sanction
are “Students Not for Taft,” “Veg-
etarians in ’52,” and “MacArthur
and McCarthy-Your Best Bet.”
Sources close to Dr. Rufus H.
‘Fitzgerald say that the Chancellor
is expected not to withhold offi-
cial okay for these groups.
IMPLICATES OPPONENT

“Vegetarians in ’52,” with an
estimated 17 members is headed by
College Senior Jim Rock. Says
Rock: “A head of lettuce at every
meal would go far toward solving
the problem of the world.”

The Hero of Bataan, in a letter
to the student group, said that he
would run for President only if no

An “unidentified man” d

escribed as a “common thief”

was apprehended today in the Red Tuck Shop in the act of

stufﬁng 38 slices of ham into

Joe Hedges.

They were aided by four Pink-
erton operatives who were sitting
in the Kappa Kappa Gamma
booth when the alarm was sound-
ed. The Pinkertons, retained by
the University to enforce the Vol-
stead Act, are allegedly quartered
on the third floor of the Kappa
Alpha Theta House. ‘

NOTORIOUS BACKGROUND

The “unidentiﬁed man” was
charged with resisting arrest, mo-
lesting Nationality Rooms hostesses
and subversion. Chief Berry said
he became suspicious when he no-
ticed that the alleged thief was not
Wearing a dink.

The “unidentiﬁed man” told
Senior Court Chief Justice Carol
Smith that his name was James
(the Fink) Rock. He reportedly
divulged his age as about 30. He
revealed his occupation as a part-
time student» in Orientation 102.

His, address, he averred, was 167,

 

his watchpocket. He was nab-

bed by Police Chief Harry Berry and Moralssquad Detective

Sixth Ave., Homestead. ‘
When Chief Justice Smith (MA.
1-0777) arraigned the alleged thug,
she questioned him as to his mo-
tives for the daring theft. Rock‘re-
plied, “I wanted a job as editor of
the Panther.” B
Miss Ruth Cramblet, a cook in
the University Food Service, ex-
pressed. amazement over the theft.
She said: -
“I am amazed.”

also “amazed.” A special resolu-

tion forced through Student Con-
gress expressed its “amazement.”
The resolution also called for
thicker slices of ham to prevent
further outrages. Miss Cramblet

urged that legislation be passed
outlawing watchpockets.

Bob Gardner, self-styled special
investigator and close friend of
Miss Cramblet and some other
girls, indicated that he had been
shadowing Rock every day for the
past two years. He said he could
see the serving line from the table
where he eats dinner with Miss
Cramblet.

At the hearing Rock implicated
Larry (NMI) Adler and Ronnie
(the Greek) Eckert. They con-
fessed that they were “hungry.”
Allthree men are members of the

ety. ~

The ﬂurry of recognition of the
political groups came as a surprise
to most of Pitt’s faculty and ad-

spokesmen had expressed the
opinion that the University would

‘withhold recognition of campus

politics, for fear’ that the Pennsyl-

idea that Pitt was a nest of Com-

IMPRIMATUR: ELIZABETH 11, By Grace of God

  Ban That Rag

Every year at this time the decent, law-abiding citizens ‘

of this great educational community, who follow the tradi-
tions hallowed by their forefathers, look with foreboding
towards the ofliceof the Panther‘ for some new outpouring
of unrelieved sophomoric ﬁlth. Even now the low—type
leaders of this organ are plotting to pollute the pure Amer-
ican air with their intellectual leavings, conniving to cor-
rupt all that we hold dear. - _ “

It is high time that the vrespectable citizens of this com-
munity band together to restrain these alien beasts. They
have fouled the minds of our daughters and sweethearts;
they have shattered the peace of our Mothers who see what

their daughters must cope ‘with; they have insulted our

great "ally by slandering their new Queen; they have pla-
garised with unmitigated frequency; they have copies_ of
the USSR Magazine in their office; and they are! planning

a lurid and sensational expose on one of our most‘ vener- .

fable professions. .

All of this is sufficient to warrant immediate and de-
cisive action by the WSGA Senior Court. They should move
to banthis 25-cent insult to our morales.

More Crackpots Loose

' The insidious forces which are forever at work on the
very foundations of our cherished freedoms are showing

' themselves more boldly than ever here at Pitt. A vociferous

minority is plugging" for a student union. You would sup-
pose that by this time Americans would be aware of the
dangers inherent in the union movement, aware that each
timethey join a great amalgamation they lose one more
drop of their freedomto powerful unionracketeers. _ /

We have a large and comfortable, as _well as attractive,
Cafeteria in which we can meet our friends and ‘catch a
low—cost snack. There are two spacious and well-ventilated
Tuck Shops for our use. Yet, you find in our midst these
crackpot visionaries with their idealistic “dreams.

Although the Hearse papers have been consistently pro-
union, we cannot throw our support behind this misguided
project. We urge the sane students to disavow these dan-
gerous anarchists.’

These" Days

I)-

Many earnest Americans have been devoting
much’ of their time to investigating subversive
textbooks and irresponsible, un—American pro-
fessors. But they might well have turned their
efforts to analysis, of a publication too frequently
overlooked as a. possible, and equal1y—dangerous,

source of contamination of the American student

with a negative attitude toward traditional basic
values-—~the college newspaper.

Most college papers are by their very nature’

insipid chronicles of school events, and no one can

hold against them their tendency to callattention‘

to pep rallies more often than they call attention
to basic tenets of democracy. .

Since the vast majority of colleges have onl
one newspaper, a monopoly exists which makes it
ideal as a mouthpiece for a vocal minority which
can ignore the great silent majority.

A perfect llustration of this is the Pitt News,
student newspaper at the state—supported Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.’ _

Under the leadership of campus “liberals” the
paper ﬁrst tricked the faculty into supporting it
by loudly arguing for salary raises for the teach-
ers. Then its editors violently agitated against a

state legislature proposal which would have asked V

a simple oath of loyalty from all employees of in-
stitutions receiving state funds, aimed at prevent-
ing the development of cancerous cells of Com-
munism. U
But today a strong new paper makes its ap-
pearance on the campus, the Pitt Pun-Telegraph,

cleared by the University as the official rival to the
Pitt News. This came after acknowledgement of the
fact that without’ competition, the Pitt News had‘a
near-fat-al stranglehold on the throats of the silent
majority. ‘ L
Minus the common humility manifested so well
by George Washington, who turned down a chance
to be king, the Pitt News’ arrogant editors had
alienated themselves from the mass of the students

and from their representatives in a Student Con-3 i ;

gress through “witchhunt” tactics.

A They’ also lost an advertising contract fromthe
University Food Service. ' I

This came after the paper tried‘ to underrhine

(conﬁdence in the quality of the University’s loyal

staff by attacking the price structure for coffee and

chocolate sundaes in the Tuck Shops. The latter

are excellent examples of healthy competitive
small businesses under-the free enterprise system.

True to the Marxist doctrine of shifting its “line”,
without losing sight of end objectives, the News
has drawn angry criticisms accusing. it of being

' both. “pro—fraternity” and anti—fraternity.”

An American reactioniwas inevitable. Led by
Jim Furbee, a student, denouncements of the Pitt)
News for “bigoted one-sided coverage” led to _a_
break in the evil monopoly: establishment of the
Pun-Telegraph, which will back a popular plat3
form of “More students, fewer pesty profs, and no

textbooks” and concentrate on being pro—American I

and anti-Pitt News. I predict the News will fold.

RED INEFSTED

Pitt, as a matter of fact, al-
though it has an old an respect-
ed name, is filled with subver-
sive anti-American ideas. The
rats and skunks who have intro-
duced their dirt and ﬁlth at the
Oakland school are slowly gain-
ing control.

For instance, only a few days
ago information from one of my
pro-American sources reached
me that in Stephen Foster Me-
morial the local gang of phony
internationalists put on a lecture
for UNESCO, a UN division that,
employing the insidious pink
Fabian methods of the Dewey-
Counts school, seeks to corrupt
and degrade American. education.

This meeting was held with
the apparent sanction of school
authorities despite congressman
John Wood’s exposure of
UNESCO»as “the greatest sub-
versive plot” in all history. Pitt,

which teaches courses dealing ,

with the Isms, has nothing to of-
fer explaining the fundamentals

- of Americanism, the one Ism,

straingely enough, that has been
neglected. .
OLD SOLDIER HITS -

When a few days ago General
of the Army Douglas MacArthur,
one of the few genuine Ameri-
cans left since Truman and his
bunch of puny pitifuls took over,
said we“ were driftinginto a Red
state, he hit the nail on the head.

Schools like Pitt must stand
publicscrutiny and share in the
blame for the creeping subver-
sion spreading like leeches over
our Republic, or have their state
appropriation cut. '

I have more information on

k the degeneracy that Pitt has

sunk into, but I have written a
good bit already, and so will tell
you about the rest tomorrow.

Are dreams about nude women

immoral?

Not necessarily. Modern psy-
choanalysis has found that
dreams are usually symbolic of
some unrealized need of the in-
dividual, and are not to be taken
at their face value. Thus it was
found that a nude woman dream
symbolized to one man a deep-
seated desire for canned beer.

Psychologists solved "the problem -

by buying the man a few cans of
beer. The dreams stopped im-
mediately. When, a few nights
later they commenced again a
quick analysis by the nations’ top
specialists revealed a need for
boiled dandelion greens. Again
the treatment was successful.
Unfortunately, the man was con-

‘ victed of a sex offense before the

psychologists were able to deter-
mine whether the cure was per-

manent.

If a student is unable to get
passing grades in college, does

‘ it mean that he is “useless”, to

the world? , a

Only in some cases. It has
been found that many people of

below-college capacities can per- I

form very useful tasks as dieti-
tians, panderers, second story
men, vivisectionists,
ners, and professors.

If he can’t ﬁnd work in these
ﬁelds, he must then look around
for something else to do. Dr. Al-
fred C. Payne, noted psychiatrist

rum-run-

, and author of the book, Senility

in the Rhesus Monkey, says:
“Many times a_person in such a
position must employ the mech-
anism of “sublimation” in order
to achieve what he wants. This
means that the consummate in-
terfusion of circumlocution or
vperiphrase, inscruability, incog-

   

nizability, or other familiar man-

~ ifestations of obstruse expiation

commonly used. for promulga-
tions must be buried beneath the
characteristic procrustean de-
terminations of his psychie.”
This is quite a job, but it can be
done. If, however, the person is
still unable to make himself use-
ful there is one last resort. He
can stand in the center of a room

himself into a high-speed elec-
tric fan.

 

How can I stop my year-old
child from biting my ankles?

In any situation such as this it 

is always important to consider
the motivation behind the be-
havior.‘ If the parent has been in
the habit of kicking the child in
the slats or every infraction of

parental rules, the child natur-_

ally feels a strong desire to re-
taliate. He does so by attacking
directly the object which has
been causing him pain. However,
there may be other reasons. If
he is in the “oral” stage of de-
velopment he has a strong need
to put things in his mouth. The
remedy then is to have some-
thing such as a force pump or an
old tire casing to shove in his
mouth whenever he threatens to
bite. If he shuns these objects,
however, and insists on going for
your ankles, we suggest you
stand on your head, then you’re
in a position to bite back.

Threat to   Industry
Charged by Prexy

By KARL VON WIGWAM

'Amertca’s Oldest Foreign Correspondent

(World Copyright, Reg. U. S. Pat Off.)
REYKJAVIK, Iceland, April 1.-——Sveinn Bjornsson, presi-
dent of this doughty little Atlantic republic, was reported
deeply concerned today at rumors that EdwinAL. Peterson,
professor at the University of Pittsburgh, would offer a ﬂy-

A
V

«tying course this summer.

5 An unusually reliable source
told this correspondent that the
president may instruct Premier S.
J. Stefansson to negotiate with

Peterson or his reputed student
cohort, Bob Davis to ,stop the
course.

As this reporter sees it, a ﬂood
of Peterson-Davis-trained ﬁshing
technicians would well ruin the
thriving Icelandic ﬁshing indus-

, try.

.Last year, it was learned, these

T A-hardy Scandanavians hauled 352,-

000 tons of ﬁsh out of the Atlantic,
a per capita average of 7,055 tons.
' This reporter tried to reach Pitt
Chancellow Bob Hood for com-
ment on Peterson’s action. But.
since this doughty little nation of
'140,000 persons has only. 17,632
telephones, and all of them were
in use at the time, the call could
not go through.
But a reliable source close to

A the fishing industry here at Rey-'

kjavik says that internal politics
at the University of Pittsburgh are
behind this ﬁshing coupe.
C He said in strictest conﬁdence
that such rising political lights as
Ross Reese, Syl Wolf, Jay Jacob-
son, ‘Lloyd Welling, Dul Lippert,
Dan Berger, Lois Holzer, and Gene
Rock have come out in favor of
‘Peterson. '
As interpreted here by local ﬁsh
market owner Newman Howard,
-their action is a direct aﬁront to
the doughty Icelandic ﬁshermen.
By their consent, they show them-
selves in the front line of those
unidentiﬁed persons who would

,,cripple the delicate international

"counterbalance of seconomo—pisca-
torial weighting.

_  As this correspondent sees it,
now is not the time for American
ﬁshing technicians to step into

competition with the Icelanders.
Professor Peterson’s action may
well alienate heretofore friendly
elements in the Althing (Iceland
Parliament.)

You can see why all the Rey-
kjavikians from the prime min-
ister on down are in a top-secret
fury‘ today.

The other grant, of $800,000, was
presented by Col. Robert R. Mc-
Cormick, of Chicago. There were
no provisions as to how the money
is to be used, except that “it be
used to help mankind.”

Oﬁicials at the University took
the announcement of the grant
with a grain of salt, it was re-
ported. They allegedly feared that
there were “political strings” at-
tached to the money, and that ac-
ceptance of it would put the school
in a “compromising position.”
Some even expressed doubt that
McCormick had that much money.

A story which appeared‘ in yes-

a few errors. Lester Brailey is not
a “communist;” he is still alive;
he is not on the dean of women’s

of the Polish embassy; he is not an
alien; he has taken out his ﬁrst
papers; he “denies” beating his
wife; he has paid his frat dues;
and he was not at the “Greeks” on
the night of Dec. 7, 1915. Aside
from these errors the story was
correct. ‘

As Carlson
Quits Under Fire

An Institution
Collapses

Davies New Mentor

After, 30 years of ruining the best basketball talent in
Western Pennsylvania, Dr. H. C. (Hep Cat) Carlson has
given‘ up trying to satisfy Admiral Tommy Hambone and

,yesterday handed in his resignation, effective today.

Immediately the basketball players expressed their grati-

tude and voted to have Chick Davies of Homestead and

Carlson, the Pitt fakir, exchange positions.
Davies will handle springdrills
beginning next week.

Pitt Basketball A Circus

Meanwhile, Carlson was taking
the promotion to Homestead in
great stride.’ His comment was,
“To hell with Pitt and all of its
prejudices. Everything was so

when that oversized Field House
:was put up I had to win or, else.
,Well, no one’s going to tell me‘
what to do.”

A telephone conversation with
“an unreliable source at Penn
State, "a Mr. Jim Floor, gave the
impression that the Maritians of
State College were desiring the
services of ‘Bubbles’ Carlson to
teach the Staters self-preserva-
tion after the Kentucky defeat.
A,But Carlson was too, happy with
his position to give a hoot about
Penn State. “I don’t give a damn
about the zone, I’ve got a basket-
ball team instead of atbunch of
clowns. I wish Chickie the worse
luck in the world, and I hope that

Field House collapses.”

T Turtle Olson To Stay

- On a visit to the peaceful little
‘town of Homestead I found Davies
in his favorite pastime of drinking
suds atithe Silver taproom.

Davies expressed optimisrn about the Pitt setup. “First, he said,

“we’ve got to get rid of that Hambone, he’s been in the Navy too

long. ’ Pretty soon he’11’have water polo at Pitt. Next‘, we get rid

of wrestling by sending Sexy Rlexy Peery back to Oklahoma.”
’ “Then I’m going to put one-of my boys in office at Pitt, probably

a good Homestead man like Race Horse Olson.” You know that
 athletic supporter is a Homestead man. I’l1.let him sell score cards

at the basketball games.” ' A ‘ . l A

Leaves For

ABemidi State

By BOBBY PROSIDINE I

The athletic committee to-
day announced the resignation
of Capt. Tom Hamilton as ath-

letic director and the imme-'

diate signing of Salvatore So-
lazzo, prominent New York
sports promoter, to ﬁll the va-
cated post.

Lt. Hamilton left yesterday to
assume his new duties as player-
coach of the Bemidji Prep squash
team. ‘

Solazzo has been active in court
circles for two years, in connection.
with LIU and CCNY, and is re-

sponsible for sending up, several 

of -the

players.-

HAPPY TO BE INVITED w_
According to an athletic sup-

city’s ﬁnest basketball

porter, “Solazzo is the man
the job since the situation here .

SALVATORE sAL,,azzo

is in need of repairs. And we have
heard that S01 is quite a ﬁxer.”

From his sprawling graystone
mansion overlooking‘ the Hudson,
the new director accepted with,
“I’ve been waiting for a chance to
get out of my present situation,
even if I have to take the Pitt
job.” He has recently been manu-
facturing license plates.

Mr. Solazzo apparently has plans
for the basketball future already,
for he was heard to remark,
“When Ileave here, I’m going to
take a couple of guards with me.”

LOADED WITH IDEAS

All the facilities here at the new

boss’s disposal, including the Field
House ofﬁces are occupied by En-
sign Hamilton. * ‘

In revealing his plans for put-‘
ting Pitt back in the spotlight,
Mr. Solazzo said, “We want to
make sports a paying proposition,

and‘ we’re willing to gamblegl in. i

tend to remodel the Field House,
putting in a bar and ‘gaming
tables to give the students a fair
shake for their money.”
HAMILTON NOW A SEAMAN

A complete turnover in athletic
policy is expected from the new
regime.

Swimming Coach Ben Grady
will be replaced by Esther Wil-
liams, thereby opening the door
to girl swimmers. And tryouts are
now open for co-ed cheerleaders.

When the ousted Grady heard
the news,- he rushed back to the _
YMHA and tried to join the team
as a breast stroker, but the roster
was already ﬁlled by members of
the athletic committee. A

It was suspected for some time
that Seaman 1/C Hamilton was

Jelly Race
Outcome

Awaited

The entire campus today

was tense as the ﬁnal outcome
of the exciting jelly and jam
contest rested with the five care-
fully selected judges who have
been conducting exhaustive tests
since last year.~According to Dr.
Auleen Jamison, head of the
Women’s Health Service, 38
freshmen girls and two unmarried
seniors had already surcumbed.
So intense was the interest dis-
played by the student body that
Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald

  
   

Falkeerg

Capone

cancelled all classes for the re‘-
mainder of the day. The Tuck
Shops were’ practically deserted
as students thronged to the lavish
twelfth floor kitchen to await the
outcome. '

A report from the judges as the
that the list had been narrowed

They were selected from a ﬁeld of
10,000 hopeful coeds who entered
the thrilling competition.

The lucky girl who wins the
Pun—Tele sponsored recipe race
will be awarded thirty cases of
jam made from her recipe and
one of the male judges for a hus-

band. She wil be given a free sub-

scription to the Pun—Tele and a
pass to the Nationality Rooms.
The judges names are being
kept a secret because it was felt
that some of the contestants
might resort to unfair tactics in
eliciting a favorable judgment. All
of contestants are sorority girls.

Feds Probe Owl
Bootleg, Babes

Federal agentsyutoday were in-

 

. vestigating the Owl as the possible

headquarters for a vast bootleg-
ging ring which extends as far
north as Buffalo. Chief prober
Jack Hardman told his friend Bill
Ricard that the Owl was a verita-
ble cesspool of “booze, babes and
birds.” '

The lurid charges grew out of
wealthy Business Manager Marv
Jacobson’s high living and play-
boy Editor Liezer Balk’s fre-
quent trips to “the printers” in
Buffalo where he allegedly spent
money like water.

Implicated with the two top
birds were Irv Greenberg, arrest-
ed twice already in the Edison
Hotel, Gloria Hennigan and Bar-
bara Millen, both of whom ap-
peared before the Board lastweek,
and a character identiﬁed only as
“gigles.” B

Food Probe
Results Hit

At a hectic meeting yesterday,
Student Congress president Cereal
Wecht (Rep., Wisconsin) an-
nounced results of’ the current

probe of the University Food Serv-
ice, ignoring protests and tears
from the office of Dean of Women
Helen Puddle Rush.

Wecht declared:

“We ﬁgured that this (investiga-
tion would rake up a fuss,’ so we
asked the head Gardner (Facist,
North Side) of the Building and
Grounds department to make an
impartial study to get the dirt.
We hoped to get costs cut, thus
saving students a measly bob or
two.”

Only dissenting voice in the
committee's report was that of ass’
tchairman B o g n a r (Socialist,
Western Pyschiatric), who agreed
with chief meat-shaver Savina
Skewered’s declaration that “stu-
dent bills , are bad but ours are
worse.” I .

Chief recommendations of the
committee were: .

It was closely-contested all the way, neither squad gain-

ing a margin of more than seven
points during the entire skirmish.

Playing with only ﬁve men, the —

Merts couldn’t keep up with the
pace set by the faster and taller
Mixers.

The Merts managed to hold their

.own until midway through the
fourth quarter. Then, the drive-
ins of Tom Baynhan and one-hand
push shots of Chuck Knauss gave
the Mixers a 40-33’ lead with three
minutes left in the game.
Although the Merts rallied, they
couldinot overcome the Pharmacy
boys, who played possession-type
ball the remainder of the contest.
Jim Van Kirk, who led this ﬁnal

game, was the top scorer with 15

Knauss led the winners with 13

Ray Gennaro of the Merts each

Peery Wins NCAA Mat Title

As U ram, Solomon Fail Tests

By DON SCHURMAN

UNTIRIN G THINCLAD-—Frank
lKuzma, veteran Panther track
ace, won the one and two-mile
runs in the senior AAU track
meet at South Park Saturday.

Hugh Peery, Pitt’s fast-
climbing young wrestling star,
whipped all comers in the
NCAA tournament at Fort Collins,
Colo., last weekend to become the

.new national lightweight cham-

pion. ,

With astonishing ease, the soph-
omore scrapper eliminated the na-
tion’s best col- .  .
legiate 115-
p o u n d e r s in
w in n i n g the
highly coveted
title.

Never o n c e
behind in his
f o u r matches,
he outscored his
ﬁnal three Cop-
ponents, E 1 3 -y 6
6-3,pand 4-0.

It w a s t h e
same sterling form that Peery ex-
hibited ‘almost throughout the reg-
ular season, when he achieved an
almost unbeatable 10-1 record.

His two teammates in the tour-
ney, Charley Uram and Joe Solo-
mon, although both holding equal-
ly outstanding season records, were

not able to match Peery’s success, .

however,
Both scored impressive victories
in first round competition,

Such were also the fortunes of ,

Pitt’s other NCAA aspiring team
over the weekend, Ben Grady’s
swimmers. .

Although the swimmers scored
one of the best seasonal charts in
Pitt history, they were unable to
score a point in the national cham-
pionships at Princeton, NJ.

IM SOFTBALL CALL

Anyone interested in play-
ing IM softball this spring
should contact Leo Bemis at the
Field House or phone 671 as soon
as possible. If you are not now
attached to a particular team,
Bemis will ﬁnd a place for you.
Softball will again be played
at Schenley Oval.

Seven Track

With home appearances at
a premium, Carl Olson’s «track
team will compete in ﬁve dual
and two intercollegiate meets this
spring.

Only two of the seven meets are
scheduled for the Stadium track-

After opening at Delaware on
Apr. 12, the thinclads op_en the
short home card a week later
against Miami. An appearance by
Notre Dame on May 10 complete
the season’s track activities at the
Stadium. 1

Even. with such a lopsided
schedule, however, Coach Olson’s
harriers will see more action than
last year when they ﬁnished with
a 2-2 record.

Chances for improving the pres-
ent 0-1 record rest primarily on
the abilities of seven returning let-
termen. The mainstays of the let-
terwinnersw ‘are co-captains John
Patellos, broad jumper and
sprinter, and Frank Kuzma, miler.

The other, veterans are Bernie
Luterancik in the two mile, Dick
Sorce in the shot put, Tom Dressel

in the discus, and Norm Proctor

and Frank Christopher in the high
jump.

From these and other star per-
formers, Olson will select teams to
compete in the Penn Relays in late
Aprilvand in the lC4A’s at the end
of May.

First Day Finds Dawson
Without Aide, Cimarolli

By BORIS WEINSTEIN

Coach Lowell “Red” Dawson experienced his ﬁrst run
in with trouble since his arrival here as football mentor, and‘
it, unfortunately, came in overdoses.

After the ﬁrst day of spring football drills, which opened
yesterday at Trees Field, Dawson, Pitt’s fourth head coach
in as many years, knows exactly what it’s like to have a

Worldfulof problems.

On this ﬁrst day of April--and
it’s no April Foolin—the ex-
Michigan State aide is without a
head line coach and a star half-
back. He also may lose ﬁve varsity
lettermen to the navy.

_ Kulakowski Top Choice

. Harold Lahar, Pitt line coach for
six weeks and Dawson’s' personal
choice for the post, accepted the
head coaching position at Colgate
University last week. His succes-
sor has not been named as yet.

The most prominently mention-
ed candidate for the line coaching
job here is Ed Kulakowski, for-
mer assistant and trainer at Austin
College, Texas. He applied for the
Panther post after Austin dropped
football this year.

Athletic Director Tom Hamil-
ton commented after Lahar’s res-
ignation , that he doubted very
much if the vacated post would
be ﬁlled by anyone from the cur-
rent staff.

Cimarolli Deﬁnitely Out

Meanwhile, Lou Cimarolli, lead-
ing ground gainer last‘ year, will
