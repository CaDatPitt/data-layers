Unin Sotght In  

*9 Universityis Hospital

in

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

Under the threat of an injunc-
tion issued Jan. 12 and weather
conditions rivaling the Great
Flood. hospital workers from
Presbyterian University initiated
strike action Friday morning.
Picketing the main entrance of
Presby and the entrance tolthe
parking lot of Children’s Hospital.

The turnout of the workers who
were requesting a minimum wage
of $100 per week and representa-
tion by the National Drug and Hos-
pital Workers’ Union No. 1199P,
provided a base of contradiction
between hospital administration
reports and official union infor-
mation.

Charles Goodwin, community
relations director for Pre s b y,
claimed that the absentee count
reached only 75 persons for the
morning shift; he furtherassert-
ed that the average rate of absen-
teeism is only about 60.

A union spokesman, however,
insisted that out of a possible-575
potential strikers, 480 supported
the strike and failed to make their
jobs Friday morning. ’

This position was reiterated«by'
Michael Williams, a hospital em-
ployee who manned the picket line

V from 5 a.m. until late afternoon.

Williams, an orderly in Unit 94,
revealed that the greatest number
of pickets present at any one time
reached about 100, "many were
students and members of the com-
munity.“ _ -
Policing Straggler

But he said, "The number of
people who came to work could be
counted on one hand.” While he
viewed his own function as one of
"policing stragglers," traffic

passed through as, usual. heas,-—

serted.

Goodwin, nevertheless. leveled
charges of harrassment against
the picketers. The normal number
of Bucci Detective Agency police
who provided security at the insti-
tution was more than doubled to
15.

\
This force was supplemented by
policemen from the Sheriffs of-
fice who during the course of the

. morning arrested two persons on.

D-

   

charges of violating injunction
stipulations that prohibited:

—_interference, with , hospital _ _e_tn- 
-‘ 3 V‘-ployees in‘-.‘.‘ A ' '

pursuit" of theuf; till.-

   

—impeding ingress or egressinto
hospital premises. ’

A union spokesman claimed that
the two arrestees were" hospital
employees, Lew Nobley and Doug-
las Jones, who had “been provok-
ed by police harrassment ‘into
breaking the injunction"; Good-
win, on the other hand countered
that both were non-employees
“who had entered the hospital and
threatened working employees.  -

No Agreement ,

The force of the strike was a
further area of contention be-
tween the two opposition groups.
Union 1199 spokesman affirmed
that hospital functions were se-

verely curtailed by the absence of ‘

large numbers of its essential em-
ployees; they cited the example of
a three—hour delay in the serving
of breakfast.

Hospital administrators insist-
ed that there was no breakdown.
pointing to the operations of the
hospital cafeteria} predicted as
one of the first facilities to close
upon the strike "success.“

The strike attempt continues to-'
day at three hospitals in the area,
Presby, Mercy Hospital and West-
ern Psychiatric Institute. Picket
lines went up at 6 a.m. «

Worliers

by BOB GING
News Editor

As a result of six.weeks of ne-
gotiation impasse. a number of
workers at an area hospital went
on strike Friday at 6 a.m. The
workers struck at University
Presbyterian because they alleg-
edly have been refused the right to
vote for a union to represent them.

\

According to reports. the ad-
ministrators at the hospital have
given them the right to unionize;
but they have not been permitted
to choose which union they want.

‘ ‘Thursday. the night before the

‘strike. at a rally in the Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial Hall. a
group of speakers. including Mrs.
Corretta King. put forth the rea-
sons for the strike. "Injustice in
Pittsburgh," stated Mrs. King.
"is a threat to justice anywhere."

Credit-No Entry System

MONDAY, MARCH 23, '197of_  ‘ll 

Grade Revisions Advanced

by BILL GORMLEY
News Editor

The College of Arts and Sci-
ence (CAS) Council “voted
Thursday to drastically revise
grading procedures at the’Uni-
versity. The Faculty of Arts
and Sciences (FAS) is sched-
uled to uphold or veto the deci-
sion April 9 at an open meet-
ing in L009 Clapp Hall.

Under the proposed setup. a stu-
dent would be permitted to take

‘ any course on a credit—no entry

basis. Unless he did "less than
minimally competent work" in a
course. he would receive credit
for it. If he failed to accomplish
this much. nothing would be mark-
ed on his transcript so that it
would be as if he never signed up
for the course.

'The sole exception to this pro-
cedure would be in the student's
major field. Departments would
be allowed to stipulate that ma-
jors take all or a certain number

of departmental courses on a let-
ter grade basis.

To accommodate students who
prefer present methods ot‘eval-
uation, the traditional letter grade
structure would be retained. How-
ever, subject to the approval of
the CAS Council, departments
could offer some of their courses
only on a credit—no entry basis.

A. Dean's List would continue to
be published each term. but in or-
der to qualify. students would be
obliged to receive letter grades
for at least 12 credits during those
terms they wished to be consider-
ed for the List.

The maintenance of a portfolio,
as suggested by the Arts and Sci-
ences Review Committee (ASRC)
in its January report, could serve
asan optional supplement to the
compilation of credits and grades.

Such a portfolio might consist of

"a variety qt" kinds of evidence of
academic and personal growth
and achievement."

Committee Report

Reveals, Irregularities 9

Over the past three three weeks
the SG.Committee on University
Resources and Services (CURS)
has met to hear and investigate

complaints registered by‘ stu-"

dents.~The ‘committee has heard
the testimony of 18 students and
has found the following after in-
vestigating those areas of con-
cern. ’ -

1) $250 WPGH Party

At the Thursday, March 19,
meeting of CURS, staff members
of the campus radio station testi-
fied about certain irregularities
regarding the handling of WPGH’s
$9,800 allocations. Marty Fruendt
and Ronaele Novotny stated that
at a March 10 meeting of the Exe-
cutive Board. General Manager

Craig Perry announced plans to,

hold a station party at a place
. O .
Strike

She told the w.orkers who were
assembled at the rally that “there
are some who said that I wouldn't
be coming tonight—but you can
tell them I was here. I also want
you to tell them that I’ll be back
again soon-—if necessary.” She
continued, saying that “your

struggle will be difficult, but your.

cause is just. Because you are
right, you will win.”

The strike took place Friday
morning. ‘butpickets were only
placed around Presbyterian Hos-

pital. A hospital spokesman claim-

ed that the 80 to 100 pickets were
mostly students and sympathizers
rather than hospital employees.
Yesterday. the hospitals sought
an injunction against the strikers
and Judge Gwilym Price issued an
injunction that all but for-bade
picketing. As a result of this. ac-
tion is planned to thwart the in-
junction and continue the picket-

_ing. Flyers going around campus

called Yeshiva. This party was to
be paid out of station funds. How-
ever, he asked’Ronaele Novotny,
acting secretary of the Executive
Board. to strike all references to
the party from the minutes of the
meeting. The party was held on
March 14 at Yeshiva.

On March _17. Pat 0’Brien
asked the_ Executive Board to ex-
plain why it had a party and also
gave gifts to “some” graduating
seniors. Mike Starr, the WPGH
accounting director, said that the
gifts were given to those senior
station members who had held-,of-
fices and contributed to the sta-
tion. He stated that money for the
drinks and the gifts had been tak-
en from student allocation funds,
and that Tom Tackage, WPGH ad-
visor, had approved the move.
Craig Perry also claimed that the
use of University funds in this way
was justified, according to the Pitt
News precident of using alloca-

_ tions to finance theirparty.

After investigating accounts at
Binstock’s and other records,
CURS has found that an electric
watch costing $115 and four other
gifts costing $38 were bought for
Craig Perry and other “select”
members of WPGH. These gifts
were given to these students at
Yeshiva’s, rented for another $48.

These practices were found to
be against the policies of the A110-
cation Committee which‘ does not
allow the use of $250 of allocated
funds for banquets or parties ex-
cept under special circumstances.
Yet special circumstances were

Finally, students would have to
“decide at the time of -registration
which grading system they wish

.to use in a given course.” Once
made, the choice would be irrevo- :

cable. ~

In a Pitt News interview, Dean V 

Jerome Schneewind of the CAS

explained that the reason for" this 
requirement was the CAS Coun- 
cil‘s desire to encourage students‘

to know in advance why they are
really taking a certain course.

Wholeheartedly endorsing the
CAS Council's plan, Dean Schnee-

wind criticized the system now in , i" W":

effect and declared, “The grade
system has broken down here at
Pitt.” Lamenting particularly the
uses to which the Satisfactory-Un-

satisfactory (S-U) option has been 

put, he noted that many students
have exercised it at the last_ min-

ute to bolster their Quality Point’  

Average (QPA). The original pur-
pose of the option, he‘ pointed out,

was_ to encourage students to ex-  V5
periment with courses they nor-»‘

mally would have avoided.

Answering one possible objec-. .
tion that might be raised to a E
credit-—-no entry option, Dr.» ~
Schneewind admitted that a stu- » 
dent might take a course on such a  
basis without ‘ever knowing how 

well he actually did, but he sug-

gested that a‘student could still’.
receive a non-recorded grade‘ if‘ A
_ he desired or at least could find‘ O 
out from his professor how much - A" "

he actually learned.

Dean Schneewind’ underscored 
the point that the CAS“Council’s’ 
plan placed a great deal 0f_€lTlr 
phasis on the individual student’s§

freedom. “It’s liberal in the sense
that it offers the students a choice

of quite a number of options." he « 7 7:‘

explained.-

Labeling the proposed system  

"very advanced," he said that its

adoption would make Pitt a colle-. 
giate pacesetter. Although other 3 ‘
universities have progressive-

evaluation procedures, he pointed
out, it is rare to find one which
both “preserves what some want
and introduces what others want.”,

While he agreed that the faculty

might properly "come up with a7 if 
compromise,‘ Dean Schneewind ‘
expressed his hope that the CAS -.7

Council's recommendations s will

be implemented. “If they are,” he. 

predicted, “we can begin to break

students of the habit that the only-

thing they are working for is the

grade and we can provide a freer 1

atmosphere for learning.”

V  Governimient Committee

 CURS Reveals Activity Irregularities

4 ) 70% ‘of Students
Not Satisfied with Saga

CURS interviewed Carl DelVel-
laggio, a manager of Saga Foods,
on March 17. He was asked
about several student complaints.
Concerning the frequency of dirty
glasses, silverware, and dishes,
Mr. DelVellaggio put the major-
ity of the blame on the students
for not returning their trays. Once
the food dries "on, it is hard to
clean off. When asked about run-
ning out of food, he said that Saga
plans. meals based on past atten-
dance. They plan one main entre
and two secondary ones. If the ma-
jority eats ,one_ of the/secondary
entres, Saga obviously runs out of
food. Mary Hague. a representa-
tive of Saga, stated that the lend-
ing of meal tickets further adds’
to the number of people eating,
over and beyond the planned num-
ber, causing the food to run out.

CURS was given the results of a
survey of 250 resident students,
conducted February 16-17, 1970,
on the compulsory meal ticket
‘system here. Ninety-two per cent
were "not satisfied with the policy
and prefered it be eliminated.
Seventy-two per cent would prefer
continuous service on a 12-14 hour
basis. Seventy per cent were not
satisfied with Saga. -

5) $600 MDC Trip to Toronto

Over the past week, CURS has
found that the Men’s Dorm Coun-
cil has mishandled much of it's
$3,800 of allocated funds this past
year. No money was ever spent
for Dorm Weekend when $1,000
was allocated for it. The dances
were sometimes mediocre and al-
ways poorly publicized. The only
cultural activity MDC partici-
pated in was a $600 trip to Toronto
for 12 "MDC representatives."

Nicholas Gervase, former. MDC
president, testified .that the mon-
ey may have\come from either the
$1,000 not spent for Dorm Week-
end, orfrom the rental of refriger-
ators to dorm residents. Mr. Ger-
vase pointed out that the refriger-
ators were rented for an addition-
al $4 in order to make a profit
rather than run it as a service.
(MDC has a $2,000 surplus). Ei-‘
therway, it seems that the trip
could not be justified as anything

but a fling. One member who went
said, "There was more booze
there than we could drink.”CURS
attempted to get the opinion of the
present MDC president, Gary
Shaffer, but Mr. Shaffer refused
to testify. ’

6) A Questional MDC Election

On Thursday, March 4. a unique
MDC meeting took place. Accord-
ing to Joe Pansic. the president
pro tempore of MDC who talked
to CURS last Saturday. an elec-
tion ‘for the MDC president and
three other officers was overdue
since it should have been held in
February. He stated that he has
been pushing for the election but
that Gary Shaffer had been fight-
inghis every move. He claimed
that Shaffer said: "I have not fol-

lowed the Constitution and I am

’ not going to start now. In fact. if I

had followed the Constitution I
wouldn't have accomplished what
I have accomplished this year."
Joe Pansic reported that Shaf-
fer finally called the meeting to

, conduct the election after more

fighting. He then expelled every
one of his opposition senators who
missed three or more meetings as

required by the MDC Constitution. 1

Joe Pansic also claimed that some
senators who should have been ex-
pelled were not. Shaffer then had
MDC pass new amendments which
would require dorm wide elections
for the president of MDC.

CURS, after reviewing th e s e
areas hasfound that there is much
waste and mismanagement of the

\

funds from the activities fee. How
can WPGH spend its money on
things other than those it received

the money for, while asking for ad‘- .

ditional funds?.Why was the Ac-
tivities fee raised with the possi-
ble excess of $41.000 in the bud-
get? Why did MDC rent refrigera-

tors for a profit with a $2.000 allo- —

cation balance? It has become evi-
dent that there are some valid
complaints from’ the students
about the Saga food service. CURS
also agrees that MDC probably
needs an open election for presi-
dent but questions whether it will
be according to the Constitution.
The CURS will hear more com-
plaints _ at 7:30 p.m. Thursday,
April 2. in Dining Room C, SU. It
will be open to all students.

WPDU Qualiﬁes For Finals.

Two students from the Univer-
sity’s William Pitt Debating Un-
ion qualified for the National De-
bate -Finals tobe held next month
at the University of Houston.

John Strand, a freshman from
Cleveland, and James Kearney, a
freshman from Falls Church, Va.,
survived the two days of competi-
tion last weekend at the District
Seven Regional Tournament held
at Rutgers University.

Georgetown University and
George Washington University
join Pitt as representatives of the
District Seven region which in-
cludes colleges and universities
from New Jersey, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Vir-
ginia, Maryland, and the District
of Columbia. '

A total of 46 debate teams, se-
lected at the various regional
tournaments this weekend, will

compete for national honors at
Houston. Pitt last competed at
the tournament in 1967 when the
University placed third in the na-

tion.

WPDU will conclude its regular
March 26-29
when Patricia Burns and George
Hopson, both seniors from Pitts-
burgh, compete in the Delta Sig-
ma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha Nation- .
al Conference at the University of
Alabama.

Innovative ideas, it seems, are always met with
reactionary ideas. In many aspects of our society,
this opposition serves to m0deFat€ the Old Ideas,

tone down the news ones, and give birth to the best ,
' of both. At the University, however, it appears that

innovation in the ideas and methods of teaching are
unwelcome.

It has come to my attention in the past few
weeks, that several instructors at the University
will either be refused tenure, or be released from
teaching again, because they have attempted to
bring new ideas into their departments.

‘RIGHT NOW, speculations such as these are in
rumor stage, since most of the teachers in question
have not yetcome before their departments for ten-
ure.

It would be a shame though, to see interesting
and inspiring professors leave the University sim-
ply because they thought differently than their su-

, periors thought they should.

The University of Pittsburgh, and every other
university in this country is here specifically for the
students, and no one else.

IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS to even the fool, that
the purpose of a university is education of the stu-
dents and is not a vehicle set up to further the ca-
reer of either teachers or administrators.

It seems unfair, that teachers whom we respect
and admire because they are not afraid to talk and

Get Rid Of Old Boring Professors

teach new ideas should be foreced to leave the Uni-
versity becuase they have a different point of view.

The tensure system is supposed to give the teach-
er the security and opportunity to investigate and
explore new things. But, unfortunately, it seems
that by granting a professor tenure, he is given an
excuse to sit back and do nothing, since he now has

' security.

I WOULD LIKE to recommend to the various
departments at this University who are contemplat-
ing releasing some of their faculty for espousing
progress, that they talk to the students before mak-
ing such an unwise decision.

It is the student who has to go to the classes. sit
through the lectures and take the tests in .this Uni-
versity, not the faculty member.

Most students are sick and tired of old, worn-out.
tenured professors who still teach in the same ar-
chaic fashion that they brought to hhe University
10, 20 or 30 years ago. It is a real treat to find a
teacher who comes into the classroom with new
and interesting ways of presenting the same old
junk, or who has some new ideas to implement the
old ones.

IF WE ARE INTERESTED in building a first-
rate University, we should break our necks to keep-
these kind of instructors, and give a great deal of
thought to fact that maybe we will find it more ad-
vantageous to get rid of some of the old, boring pro-
fessors, who. although tenured, give education the
character of a stagnant pool.

And The Oleets Grated
Taking Over My Shadow

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

It was the first night of spring but the promises of warmth were
yet to be forthcoming. The lines of people waiting to enter the thea-
ter were bundled in -overcoats and fur collars. The glare of the neon
signs was reflected in the pools of water left behind by the icy show-
ers of the afternoon.

It was exactly like last Saturday night when the same thing hap-
pened to me. ’
The usual gang of malcontents was hanging out at the Briar
Bowl; I was greeted with the usual embarrassing come-ons and in-
sults. But it was still early and there was protection in the throngs
of people parading along Forbes Ave. 15".»
Atwood St. was less encouraging.

The dim street lights converted dark, nebulous,shapes into hu-
man forms only when they engulfed them, I was alone.

Only the crackling of the paper satchel in my arms broke the
silence. Until the cleets.

I could hear them behind me gaining speed as I did‘, keeping pace
with my footsteps. It was like the echo of my fate, cold, steel upon
concrete, grating. _

The dark shaped became hope, only to fade from view as unpre-
dictably as they had appeared. I was alone, alone with my mind. It
became my hope. A . ' ' V

It rationalized for me: maybe it’s someone I know trying to catch
up with me; maybe it’s a freak, freaks never hurt you; maybe he just
wants to scare me; maybe oh maybe I'm imagining the whole thing.

The cleets still followed.

Then, an oasis. A friend of a friend. A familiar face. "John," I

   

The Trial Of The Pittsburgh 3

(Editor's Note: Ted Harding and
other members of the Pittsburgh
Draft Resistance held a press con-
ference last Thursday to present
the defendant's side of the distur-
bance in the court room of Chief
Magistrate Robert E. Dauer.

(Fight broke out at the hearing of

— eight anti-draft demonstrators

charged with disorderly conduct.
The incident led to the arrest of
four of the spectators, and the in-
jury of H persons, six of them city
detectives.

(A statement from the Peace and
Freedom Center said that the inci-
dent showed “the law does not im-
partially respect the rights of all
citizens.” *

(The American Civil Liberties Un-
ion presented a series of demands
to Mayor Peter Flaherty, calling for
a civilian tribunal to check on the

' police force and total reformation

of the police department.)

by RUSS TRUNZO
Contributing Writer

On March 19, 1970, in Magis-
.trate’s Court in Pittsburgh the
Pittsburgh Police showed to white
radicals and their supporters the
same inhumanity, indeceny and

 brutality that they’ve visited upon

Black people in this city for as

‘ f long as anyone cares to remember.

" Magistrate’s Court. is supposed-

5_,,ly a publiccourt room, but it’s 10-
cated.»-.in_»‘I_the- so-called ‘Public Sa_fe- pl

Headquarters, and so it’s fre-
quented by police, in uniform and
out, who “hang around." either
waiting for their cases to be call-
ed or waiting to go on duty.

In addition, the court room is
not run by civilian bailiffs who are
court-appointed, its run by uni-
formed police.

-- Fritz

On March 19 a number of us ar-
rived at the Magistrates court a
few minutes before nine in the
morning, because some of our
friends were having a hearing on
disorderly conduct charges.

As Fritz, one of the uniformed
bailiffs, led us into the court room
to be seated he informed us that if

we didn't “behave like ladies and
gentlemen” he had more than
enough cells in the back for all of
us, and that if those weren't
enough he'd have some more built
pretty fast. '

As the seats began to fill with
our friends, so the walls began to
t'ill with men who appeared to be
police—most of them were not
wearing uniforms. and the only
thing identifying them as police
were the insulting remarks they
made toward us.

As many of them told people to
be quiet, sit down or whatever,
they were asked 'who they were
and to show identification. to

which they would laugh a;id.go

Although it hasn‘t yet been cor-
roborated, it appears that at least
one of the chief instigators for the
police was not a policeman at all
but is in fact a local newspaper
reporter. ' -

The biggest source of upset to
the police and the alleged report-
er, before the start of the hearing,
appeared to be three girls who
were sitting together in the front
row.

Fritz continually threatented
them, the alleged reporter kept
making snide remarks to them,
and finally one of the uniformed——
an officer Friedman—rushed up
to one of the girls, Roberta’ Lynch,
grabbed her by the chin. lifted her
off her chair. shook her and siad,
"You’d better keep quiet!“

Outbursts
There were a couple outbursts
during the hearing. First, when
the defendants walked in we ap-
plauded them.

Then during the course of testi-
mony the plaintiff was asked if
he could point out anyone who had
used profanityat him the night
before. and he pointed to a person
in the audience, who immediately
stood up and objected. on the
grounds that‘ he wasn’t on trial.

The plaintiff then said that even
if the young man wasn't on trial
he had in fact been there the night
before——so about 10 or 12 of us
also stood and shouted that we.
too. had been there the night be-
fore.

There wereother small ripples
of laughter, groans and such dur-
ing the course of testimony, and

the police repeatedly asked the .

judge if he wanted the court room
cleared.

Cappy Ascheim. one of the de-
fendants, had been facing side-
ways, looking at one of the cops,
and at one poirit one of the bailiffs
grabbed Cappy by his hair to turn
him around.

A number of us jumped up, and
surged forward. yelling. "Stop
that." We were shoved and thrown
back into our chairs by a group of
police. some people ‘were knock-
ed down and there was general
scuffling while Cappy shouted at
the judge that he wanted to press
charges against the bailiff.

When things quited down. one of
the police asked the magistrate if
he wanted to clearfthe court. the
said. "Clear th e
court,“ and that was the signal the

tiiigfor

 

    

called. “John, don‘t you remember me.”  
It wasn’t John. But I stopped and I talked and I listened for the If 
cleets. 
The cleets crossed the street. The cleets were leaving; they l
headed for Oakland Ave. I had been wrong.
I left John who wasn’t John and I walked on, in no light with no
people. content in my folly, in my paranoiaz ,
And the cleets crossed the street again.
They became bolder. no longer satisfied .with the status’ quo of
my pace. There were no dark shapes now and the only reassurance
was the movement of my shadow; itggave proof of my existence, my
aloneness. The sanctum of my mind was cracking. ,
The cleets were right behind me now; their shadowibegair to
overlap my own, its existence to crowd mine out.
To kick in the testicles; to poke out the eyes; to reason. 

I turned and the cleets had the face of my brother, with the
same face with the same hair, but different eyes. Eyes of steel, eyes
that echoed the sound of steel grating on concrete.

The cleets had a hand, a hand that tried to grasp, to hurt, to trap.

And I ran. iranallthewayuparoundthecornerandintothewrong-‘

How Our Readers See It

Family Newspapers

Fear Aborﬁon
Issue

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is encouraging to see that The
Pitt News is embracing the abor-
tion issue, for it is quite relevant
to our students and, even more so,
to the members of the commun-
ity. I .

The irony of the present situa-
tion, is that the “family" newspa-
pers in the area have not yet had
the guts to speak about the need
for abortion reform, when, in fact,

about 90 per cent of the women ,

seeking abortions, happen to be
married.

The standard and feeble excuse,

_ of the editors, for avoiding the top-

ic, is that they do not want to "of-
fend” their readers.

When will "these narrow-mind-
ed people get over the absurd no-
tion, that “nice people" do not
need abortions and should not talk
about abortion. Do not these hy-

-pocrites realize that there is no

sterotype of the abortion seeker?

The problem of\ the unwanted
pregnancy is not one which is just
limited to the ghetto dweller, but
a problem which can just as easi-

.ly affect the dweller of middle or

upper class suburbia._

I might draw an analogy be-
tween the abortion problem of the
1970’s and the venereal .disease

_ problem of the ’30’s. Unitl people

accepted VD as a medical prob-
lem, rather than as a sympton of
morality, nothing could be done to
curb this disease.

We must also realize that abor-
tion is a personal medical matter,
and one that should be able to be
dealt with, by the pregnant wom-

“ an and her ‘doctor, alone.

It is not a matter for by-stand-

ers to make value judgments‘

about, and as such, T find it most
nauseating that the law makers

ACLU-Reform Or
Oiscontinue ROTC

Editor, The Pitt News:

In a national meeting in New
York in February, 1970,'the Amer-
can Civil Liberties Union took th
position that: «

1. Where ROTC programs exist,
they should be completely volun-
tary. .

2. Academic credit should be
granted only forlthose ROTC
courses which are acceptable to
and under the control of the reg-
ular faculty.

3. ROTC instructors should not
hold academic rank unless they
are members of a normal aca-
demic department subject to reg-
ular procedures of appointment
and dismissal.

4. Where ROTC programs exist
theyshould fully observe the prac-
tices of the university or college
regarding any keeping of any rec-
ords which relate or refer to po-
litical, religious or social views
or associations of the student, in

harmony with our stand express- «

ed in Academic Freedom and Civ-
il Liberties of Students in Colleges
and Universities.

ROTC programs do not per se
violate civil liberties and academ-
ic freedom. However, ROTC pro-
grams which fail to meet the
above standards would threaten
to undermine the values of free
inquiry and academic autonomy

' which are at the heart of academ-
ic freedom and should be elimin-
ated in institutions of higher learn-
ing.

Yours very truly,

Thomas M. Kerr
President, American Civil
I Liberties Union

of Pennsylvania

 s?Aft€P,4 Yearszisé ‘
  Banner’s Track

 S R ' ht S
‘ if [A by ED CONLEY «
z _ Sports Editor .:.:.;.
V  The Pitt track squad ended its 1979 indoor season with-
‘ ..-outa win at the Cleveland Knights of Columbus Meet over
i the week-end, but the unhearalded performance doesn’t
. ' detract-from another successful session for the tracksters
L F under Jim'Banner.

Banner, who ran the quarter-mile at Pitt for two sea-
sons in the late 1940’s, is in his fourth year as head track
and cross-country coach and in that period his teams have
compiled a 32-16 mark. The .667 percentage is a job-well-
done in any sport.

A The 1970 indoor campaign had a few embarrasing mo-
ments, such as the frustrating days in the East’s IC4A
 ‘competition where the thinclads only scored three points.
 ._ ~ .' But the squad had as many successes as ever._ And they
compensated for the IC4A disappointment by finishing in a
"9  four-way deadlock. for ninth place in the NCAA champion- .
ships the following week.

- The tracksters equaled and surpassed more records

.. this winter, also. With the season now completed, the rec-
 ‘ ord book shows a current thinclad involved in every indoor
" mark with the exception of the shot put. And John Simpson,
' the footballing sophomore, looks like a good bet to break

that standard eventually.

This past season also saw Banner strengthen his weak-
nesses from last year—the field events.

Don Poretto, a sophomore, cracked the long jump
mark and freshman Doug Dogenhart, took advantage of
the freshman eligibility rule to set a new pole vault record

* of 14’8”. Bryant Salter, of course, has been around a couple
, years, now, and he holds the high jump and the triple jump
 - marks. ‘ '

The outstanding performances of the year came in the
field events, though. Smittie Brown ran his fa‘stest‘600-‘yard
race, a l:l0.l, in the Pitt Track Classic on Jan. 31, giving

, him, hopes of crashing into the 1:09 class, which is indeed a
‘ a feat.

Then, Jerry Richey, who had a few physical problems
during the year raced for the- country’s,fastest two-mile
clocking and a national championship in the NCAA meet.

The future of Pitt track could endanger many of the
current squad’s accomplishments though. Banner continues
to bring in the better recruits, and this year his new assis-
tant, Jack Shaw, has taken full charge of recruiting and
looks upon his assignment with confidence, despite the fact

' that announcements of thinclads for next year aren’t forth-
coming.

He calls the early signings “Mickey Mouse” letters,’
“the guys say that ethically they’re going to come-here,

.. - but they could go somewhere else.” ‘
H « __ - Shaw’s confidence blends in with the Banner track pro-
gram. And his job is made easier by every race the track-
sters win and by every record they break. C

Lewis is looking forward forthe

Lewis’ biggest concern "at pre-'

“When they hit-in the batting cage,
the only benefits they get is to im-
prove their timing and to learn to
keep their eyes on the ball,” he ex-
plained. “Because the balls fly

to tell whether or not it was a good

Whereas‘ the hitting of the 3mit-
ters has had limited practice, the
pitching corps had enjoyed an ex-
tensive training. Lewis mention-

’ ed, “Allof the pitchers have-re-I

ceived good workouts by throwing
for the indoor batting drills.”

Lewis expects to have a strong

. defensive, ‘infield. Four ‘seniors
will be manning the posts around’ ‘
the basepaths this year. “With

Frank Gustine at first, Cliff

Brown at second, Ron O’Grodnik'

at shortstop, and Ron Howie at
third base, we possess ‘a great
deal . of experience,” the mitt
coach said. ‘

This season, Lewis expects to

,. be able to turn to "his bench when
needed. “I think we’ll have a pret-, -

ty solid bench,” he commented,

“one‘which I hope will be quite

versatile.f’

Lewis will be counting on Bob-
ert Livingston, a sophomore to '

fill in one of the infield positions if
necessary. Terry Stokes, another

soph, will be available for infield 3. Kentucky when one Season ends

or outfield spots. Ken Macha-will
bolster the catchers -and the out-
field.

Lewis is pleased with manyi

players versati_lity. “We won’t
have to carry extra men at cer-

_ tain positions becuase of this,” he

added.

The pitching staff has suffered
a stiff setback. Frank Pietron, a

. senior hurler was involved in an

auto accident and received a brok-

-en jaw. Lewis is uncertain if he'll

beable to rejoin the squad.

Relays Take
Second And
Third Spots

by JERRY MYERS '

Concentrating on , only. two '

events’ the Pitt track team con-

cluded their indoor season at the -

. Knights of Columbus meet Friday

night in Cleveland, Ohio.

Coach Jim Banner left Friday
with a well-rested squad of run-

' ners who took third place in the

two-mile relay (7:45.4) event
and fourth in the one-mileevent
(3:21.7-). The two-mile team
seriously handicapped when fresh-
man Ken Silay’. broke his ankle
while running. He managed to fin-
ish his ‘distance but the rest of the
team, Jerry Richey, Greg Rogers
and John -Aiken couldn’t make up
for the loss. a -

The usual ‘four thinclads com-

petedin the one-mile event. They ‘
~were Dorel Watley, Carlos Reis-

en, Dennis Schatzman and Smit-
tie Brown. Bill Kalchthalter com-
peted in the hurdling competition,
but didn’t qualify for the finals.

Bryant Salter also missed‘quali- .

fying in the high jump. ~

...-

‘The Knights of Columbus meet‘ 4

seemed like a slight digression
from the vigorous competiton of
the NCAA finals just the week be-
fore. Jerry’ Richey, Pitts’ All-
American- long-distanceman -con-
sidered the K of C ‘-‘just a small
dual meet.’-’ Richey has been run-

ningat a peak level this past week ’

and he was more-or-less up for

- the meet. - -

Banner, now that the indoor sea-
son has come to a close, takes his
squad out into the fresh air for the
outdoor track competition. Ac-

cording to" Banner, “We just nev- ’

er stop,” pertaining to the perpet-
ual season the runners seem en-
gaged in. Starting back in Septem-
ber with the cross country meets,

_ most of the thinclads havebeen

running for almost nine months. "
Some of these .workhorses are
guys like Jerry Richey, Dave’

Cheseborough, Bog Hanger, Gregg; A

“ﬁnal

Rogers,.and John Aiken.

With one and two practicesa
day, every day of the week, it is

understandable what ‘kind of grind‘. / I

the thinclads go. through. Last
week, when asked if the distance-‘
men ’ were practicing, Banner
laughted, ‘-‘They’re only takingla
light workout today. They’re' run-
ning about ten miles.” On.Monda'y
the tracksters ran to Mount Wash-
ington and back. ' n '

The opening outdoor meet at‘ S I

Kentucky is only two weeks away.

.»Banner commented. “Our year

seems to never end. We'll. be tak-
ing almost everybody with us to:

the other one just begins.”

Wrestling coach Dave Adams
has never stopped climbing.

Three years ago Adams /wasan
assistant coach at the East’s.top
wrestling school, the Naval Aca-
demy. He had rejected various of-
fers which would have elevated
him to a head coaching position. -

Then. the University of Pitts-
burgh came to his door. This time,

:3,

I however, Adams didn’t treat the ‘

prospective employer like a busy
housewife encountering a persis-
tent Fuller brush man.

“It was something that I could-
n’t turn down,” he said. “The
other offers didn’t present the
type of situation that I was look-
ing for. I didn’t believe that the
schools really wanted a top-notch
program.” .

Even though Pitt. has been on a
rapid descent since_1960, Adams
was overwhelmed at the prospect
of reversing the losing trend.

"It was an honor to think that

Pitt ‘believed that I could bring
them back up,” Adams stated.

as . "Pitt was at the top once, and this

"» ‘is a terrific high school wrestling .

Climbing To ¥TopIn
Eastern Wrestlirtg?

area. The Athletic Department is
sincerely interested in building a
good program here."

In order to begin his push to the
top, he realized that he would have

' to lift the quality of recruiting and

the apathetic attitude at the Uni-
versity.

"We had to change the attitude

of the guys on the team—making
them feel that they weren’t going
to get beat every timeout," he
said. ' ._
"Also we‘ve been working for
student acceptance. We would like
the students to feel that the wrest-
lers are representing them.“

“A big thing concerning student
support regards everyday living
around campus. It helps morale
when -the kids let them (the squad)
know that they're interested. The
guys then feelwvhat they are do-

ing is worthwhile. ”

Enthusiastic recruiting is an-
other contribution to Adams’ as-
cending program. He knows that
he must combat the most promi-
nent schools in the East for the
superior wrestlers, and yet he
feels . that . by stressing Pitt‘s
strong points-and ignoring the
"dirty“‘ tactics employed -by
many other schools he can accom-
plish his goal. ‘

When hestarted at the bottom.
three years ago, he believed that

within four years Pitt could again

enter the East’s top echelon. This .

past season, the grapplers tied
for fifth in the East. Next season,
Adams mentioned that to climb
beyond Penn State and Navy and
into the title of Eastern Champion
would be “awfully hard." "We

. could give them a good fight,“ he

said.

wishes someone would do something about it. _ ..

The cold, wet-weather has been hampering practice. Shanunopin 
Country Club. the team‘s home course cannot be used until the weather; "

damage the course.

Coach Peery fears that the,in-
clement weather will force him to
reschedule his first three matches.

‘The golf team is slated to swing
into action on March 31, but if the

bad weather continues this date _

may-he changed.

This may be to the team’s ad-

vantage though. After the first.

three matches, as the schedule
now stands,he team would have
a two-and-one-half week lay-off.
The elimination of this gap in the
schedule would solve one of
’Peery‘spproblems.
