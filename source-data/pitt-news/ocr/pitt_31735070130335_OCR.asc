Lander sparks GB controversy

‘ . DAVID  Tu‘RNER/ MANAGING EDITOR
Student Government Board member "Dave lander reads from a prepared state-
i ment outlining his discontent with SGB’s referendum planned for Oct. l8.

DAVID TURNER
‘ Managing Editor

Student Government Board mem-
ber Dave Lander twice raised con-
tentions about the upcoming referen-
dum to change the board’s constitu-

_tion last night at its weekly public

meeting.

The referendum, scheduled for‘

Oct. 18, will determine the time of
year when SGB terms begin.
Currently, ‘elections are held in the

-fall, and- the referendum" ‘question

asks if students would prefer spring
elections. ‘

During the second of Lander’s
assertions, he read for four minutes

'-from a‘ prepared statement in which

he explained his concerns. He said he
had .. sent the ’ statement to Vice
Provost and Dean of Students Sharon
Johnson. L ’

Earlier in‘the meeting, during the

time in ‘which student groups’,
requests for budgetary changes are
considered, Lander tried to prevent
funds from being allotted to -pay; for
rented election booths for the‘referen—'
dum. -.  , ' s .
He cited a rule in SGB’s Student
Allocation Handbook that prohibits
money being granted for programs

‘after they have been adivertisedifor.

Members of the Constitutional
Review Committee were not deterred
by Lander’s argument of losing
funds, noting that the Voting could

take place using pieces of paper and
cardboard boxes.’

After Business Manager Mike
Unangst advised the board members
to vote their conscience on both the
program and their interpretation of
the rules, the allocation was approved
5-4, with President Joan Snyder pro-
viding the tie-breaking vote.

As aresult .of Lander’s actions,
Snyder has arranged a meeting on
Friday in which the. board willmeet

‘with the chairman and vice-chairman

of the CRC, the board-appointed
group‘ that ultimately came- up with
the idea for the referendum. ' '

Snyder said that Lander’s dissen- A

sion tookiher by surprise.’ .

“All ,1 can say is that I hope that
Friday will be var. good constructive
conversation where my board mem-
bers can getftheir questions answered
by the CRC and where the CRC can
update my board,” Snyder said.

Landerclaimed that the majority

-of the-problem stemmed from .a lack
‘ of ‘communication between the CRC

and -the -SGB. . e L

“What I did tonight was what 1 a

had to do to get this meeting to ‘hap-

pen,” Lander said after the meeting.

“I’m just sad that this didn’t happen
before the final decision.” _

In Lander’s statement, he regis-
tered several complaints, most of

lwhich were directed at the CRC»,

Assistant News Editor

After facing a 5 percent tuition
increase this September, Pitt students will
likely see another rise in their tuition bills
next school year. s

According to Pitt Spokesman Ken
Service, the minimum increase would be
almost 5 percent, reﬂecting the

’ University's rising operational costs, as
well as plans to increase funding and pos— _

sibly faculty salaries.
Pitt submitted a proposal for its 2001-
2002 state appropriation to the

Pennsylvania Education Department on
Sept. 27, requesting a 5.8 percent increase
in total “state funding. In a press release,
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said the
requested increase is below the 6-percent

.level identiﬁed in a nationalstudy as the

amount by which state frmding for public
education will have to increase in order for
universities to  current services.

If Pitt is successful in its vie for a 5.8 -

percent increase in state funding, the
University will hold tuition increases to no
more than 5 percent, costing the average
in-state undergraduate student an addi-

tional $320 a year.

If Pitt does not receive the increased
commonwealth appropriation, the tuition
increase could be greater, Service said.
The University could also reexamine its

current spending plans, and possibly cut

SOIIIC programs.

In the current ‘plan,’ Pitt would

increase ftmding in three key areas: infor-
mation technology, laboratory investment
and biotechnology. Pitt’s core . operating
costs would also be increased by $8.8 mil-

lion, allowing for a possibleincrease in

faculty salaries.
‘ “The” hope would be ‘to increase
salaries,” Service said.“ “The University

has found that it’s begun to fall behind in '
salaries, and is, not keeping up with the

competition,” he said.
Service touched on the importance of

- attracting and retaining a qualiﬁed staff,

thereby improving the quality of educa-
tion at Pitt. , ' '

Melissa Wright is a sophomore child
development major attending college on
student loans. Wright has mixed emotions
about the increase, acknowledging that
more funding may be needed in certain
areas while worrying about the bills the
tuition bike will bring. '

A “$300 doesn’t seem like a lot, but it is

if you have a $35,000 loan waiting for you
. after college,” she said. V

Many students said they felt as if the
didn’t have a say in the decision.

‘"Puition increase is generally bad,”
said freshman Jared, Preston. “But it’s not
up to us.”

i Sophomore Diane Pfmgstler dis-

" agrees, saying that tuition increases can be

beneﬁcial when the money is used in

ways that improve the ‘educational experi- -

ence.’

’ “I_ think it’s a good thing they’re
increasing it,” she said, adding that
improvements to the technological: aspect

of theuniversity are especially important. »
2 “We’re going to need technology in the

future.” ' '

The University takes a similar stance. I
« According to Service, the tuition increase
will allow Pitt to improve the quality of

education provided here and better pre-

pare graduates for their professional e

careers. _

_ “I think what the University is trying
to do is to. maintain and improve the pro-
grams available to students,” he said. “We
think in the long run it beneﬁts students in
terms of how competitive they are able to

_ be in the marketplace after graduation.”

After the state education department
reviews and makes recommendations on
Pitt’s budget proposal, it is sent. to the .gov-
ernor, -reviewed, and then’ sent to the
Senate and the House where appropria-
tions hearings are held to make a ﬁnal rec-

ommendation on the plan. The process

ends in June when the legislature votes on

the proposal and it is approved by the gov- .

emor.

After the ﬁnal‘ decision is made in
June, Pitt will approve a budget based on
the state allocations, and willvmakeﬁnal
decisions on spending, tuition and salary
increases for the 2001-2002 ﬁscal year."

DEBATE

~ ' K I 1 p A

low Republicans would share were

representative only of their personal '

beliefs. _

“We went with the group consen-
sus,” Korns said, after the debate.

Moderated by Pitt News Editor
in Chief Rehan Nasir, the student
groups met with a common mission
—— to present opposing views regard-
ing education policies. ~

As student debaters were intro-

duced, it became obvious that the

audience was more sympathetic to
the University Democrat representa-
tives. The crowd cheered loudly as
Baker, Rutledge and Spiher were
introduced.

V The winner of a coin toss would
..have the first three—minute opportu-

nity to answer the night’s first ques-
tion. The opposing party then had a
three—minute rebuttal period, fol-
lowed by a five minute round table
discussion by both parties.

The College Republicans first.
-addressed the issue of whether

vouchers should be awarded to stu-
dents to attend . primary and sec-
ondary schools. ~

The biggest crowd response of
the night came as groups debated the
validity of affirmative action as an
admission tool to public universities.

“It’s a noble idea,” Boyd said for

the Republicans. “[But it’s] a gov-
ernment—sponsored program based
on assumptions that are false.” He
said that gender and race do not nec-
essarily equal diversity.

“Real diversity comes from dif-
ferent ideas, not one idea mandated
by the government,” he said.

Korns believes that most impor-
tantly, .the discrimination that gave
birth to affirmative action should be
eradicated to make‘ the program
unnecessary. I ’

Democrats argued that affirma-
tive action’ was the only way to
ensure that women and" minorities
were able to make the ‘same salary

. and enjoy thesame benefits.

“It’s the ‘only form of justice for
them to succeed,” Baker said. _,
“Affirmative action draws in
people [to certain careers] that don’t
necessarily want to be-there,” Boyd
countered. “I am" for free choice.”
“That, was nice,’ but_it doesn’t
apply,”.. Rutledge answered. .
Moving on to federally funded
financial—aid programs for college
students, Baker argued first for the
Democrats. -

He held that investing in educa—_

tion .was the most precious expendi-
ture a nation could make _for its
future. '

Spiher said that because some
students were entering low—paying
but necessary careers after college,

-the government should help them to

Republicans seemed to -agree.
“We’re not against financial aid,”
Stratton said. “What logical college

student would be?” ‘
Republicans proposed instituting

_a, m'erit—based incentive on the cur-
rently solely need-based Pell Grant,

to avoid wasting money on students
who end up dropping or failing out

of college’, without having to pay’

back the free government grant.
Boyd recalled an earlier argu-
ment, “Financial aid is a voucher for
college students,” he said as the
audience snickered. p ‘
“I don’t know what he meant by

that,” Korns said to his teammate. . ,

As" the Republicans huddled in
conference, Spiher said, “_ [If]
Mike’s side doesn’t know what
they’re talking about, we‘ don’t
either.” The audience cheered, even
as moderator Nasir ‘warned the pan-
elists about personal attacks. '

The testy argument continued, as

Republicans hammered the idea that

financial aid should be provided at
least partially based onmerit.

“Who’s in college that doesn’t
have any merit?” Rutledge ques-
tioned. , ' /

“How about the 15 percent that
drop out?” Stratton responded.

The final topic for debate was
student activity fee structure at pub-
lic universities. - .

Republicans said that it is impor-

tant for all student «groups to be

funded equally, awarded money on a I A

“value-neutral’? basis, meaning
appropriations decisions would be
made “intelligently” and “responsi-
b1y‘” .

* ““Al1 viewpoints [should be]

heard equally,” Stratton said. “Part
of living here is to be, immersed in
different ideas and cultures.” ’
Rutledge was‘ surprised by this
deviation from the traditional
Republican platform. ’

“You use words like ‘intelligent’*

and ‘responsible.’ We use words like
democratic,” he said. .
The groups were clearly in

agreementon equal student funding. ;

“Basically, we don’t have that
much‘ to argue about,” Baker said.
“Welcome to seeing thelight, guys.”

Both groups made closing state-T _t

ments, before shaking‘ hands to end — ~

'0 Some country has to get the shaft, -

but the time-delay thing was extremely

‘annoying. It’s difﬁcult to get excited

enriched those nocturnal lifestyles.’ I

 - NBC was billing this as: ‘,‘the

Choose your protests wisely

Two thousand students march in protest,

' knocking over light poles and burning eﬂigies.

- Rage envelopes the group; students express feel-
ing of shame and anger over what their univer-
sity has become. Students are threatening the
lives of other students and the school president.
Theypare handing out ﬂiers with a picture of the

enemy, with the statement,
“Wanted Dead.” RYAN
What are these students so out-

iraged about? Harassing campus
‘police? Tuition increases? Date
rape? . _
No. These students are angry because their
institution, the University of Indiana,  its

. basketball coach, Bobby Knight.

I used to believe that any protest was a good
thing. Theright to assemble is a foundation of
what we regard as freedom. People have used
the power of protest to address many important
issues that are notbeing addressed by whichev-
* er authority is in power. '

Students protested against the Vietnam War _
T and for racial integration; they rallied for issues

that were pressing and that we now deem his-
torically signiﬁcant. Now students protest and
are arrested and pose deaﬂi threats over basket-
ball. '

I enjoy sports. I played baseball.-for 11
years; I understand the emotion that sports are
capable of bringing out in people. However, it
seems that the most volatile element in our soci-
ety today is sports. When men attack and molest
women, there is a cry as to what is wrong with
our young men. When fairs riot after their
favorite sports team wins, few even call into
question the direct link between these sporting
events and violence.

Where did this value of sports come from?
Some popular slogans come to mind -
Powerade’s “Life is a sport, drink it up,” and
“Baseball is life. The .rest is just det_ails,”, whichl

Sports and athletes have been raised to this

‘ artiﬁcial elevated status by a shrewd propaganda

campaign aimed at selling products. If you take

‘ people who are capable of superﬁcial, yet amaz-

ing feats, and put products in their hands, or
place products in commercials in between these
feats, you will sell many products.
Then you work on elevating
the status of the sport and the ath-
lete, which in turn will sell more
products and more air time. Sports
and marketing feed off each other

I to feed on‘ of us. And when it seems like it can’t

get any more humiliating they tax us to pay for
stadiums so that the team will stay in the city.
They can raise the cost of admission,-
because it’s a nice new stadium, so that the team
can play and make their “real” money olf televi-
sion revenues and endorsements for the products
that we will eventually purchase so that we can
be more like the players we love so much. Yeah,
when I was 5 years old I believed that my new
zip—up sneakers would make me rI1n faster. _
Protests like the ones for Bobby Knight are
what take away our voices as students. Such
angry and loud demonstrations‘ paint a picture of
college students as spoiled crybabies, looking
for an excuse to throw a temper tantrum. Is this
what today’s students care about Is this our
legacy? _ ‘
We care about nothing, or even worse we
care only about make-believe. Sports have a
false importance. It is scripted. The Super Bowl
is the most important game because the NFL

says so. They build it up. They determine that in ’
mid-January the ﬁnal — and thus most irnpor- '

tant — game will be played. It is OK to buy into
it, it is a distraction,.and it is a better form of
escapism than a 12—pack.

‘ But use some moderation. It is great to care
about things; it is grem that something is capable
of. banding pwple together in emotion. Just

Titan-icrflick 

Directed by Boaz Yakin

)2 ‘ ished product —-— the film’s implications and the mes-

‘ the power of Washington with the
. magic of Disney to make a very
enjoyable picture. __ ,

Based‘ on a true story,
“Remember the Titans” takes place
in Alexandria, Va. in 1971. TC.
Williams High School has just
been forced by the school board to
become racially integrated. Coach

of the football-team is told that he
is going to be replaced by Coach
Herman . > Boone (Denzel

Coach Yoast decides to stay as the

’team’s defensive co-coordinator,
but ultimately steps down for
Boone. '

. Along with a biracial coach-
ing staff, the team has also become
integrated, and training camp
becomes more ' about learning
teamwork than learning football.
After many fights, the Titans

' become one unit. But when they
get back home the real world bites
them on the nose. The team might
have come together, but the tow11
has not. ~
, Part of the fun behind this
film lays with the great characters
on the football team. Characters

T like “Sunshine” (Kip Purdue), the Californian hippie

— who might be gay; Lastik (Eth/an Suplee), the very
large “light—skinned brother” who loves football but
can’t make the grades to go to college; “Blue” (Earl
Poitier), the boy who loves to sing, “Rev” (Craig

Kirkwood), the bible quoter; and Cheryl Yoast
’ (Hayden Panettiere), the coach’s 9-year-old daughter,

a high school football fanatic. a

Director Boaz Yakin (“A Price Above Rubies”)
and writer Gregory Allen Howard are both relative
newcomers to the feature ﬁlm business, which is hard
to imagine after watching a film with so many
resources. The support and name recognition of vet-

‘ eran producer Jerry Bruckheimer has given
this film some much needed hype.

It’s a Walt Disney picture and it def-
initely shows —— the dialogue is
very deliberate and predictable,‘ but

 at times it is also very humorous

 ' and endearing. Disney had a large

 part in assembling an excellent
soundtrack with artists like Cat

.__, Stevens, Creedence Clearwater Revival,

The Hollies and Marvin Gaye.

This was the first movie I’ have been to where
people applauded throughout the movie as well as
after it. Leaving, Isaw a theater full of smiling peo-
ple. Remember the power of Disney.

say that I was one of the first people there. Star Wars ~

is one; Radiohead is the other.

I saw the 12:01 a.m. screening of The Phantom
Menace two summers ago on the official day it
opened. I stood in line with my friends, watching all
the “Darth Mauls” tripping over their ill—fitting robes
and trying not to scratch off their face paint, and did-

’ n’t feel out of place in the least. For two hours we
chatted with fellow dorks, drunk on the thought of

seeing the film at its absolute earliest; 5

Last night posed a problem, though. I had heard
a few record stores were opening up at midnight and
selling Radio'head’s newest, album, Kid A, but
between work and the research project I was terribly
behind on, I couldn’t decide ifl wanted to stand in
line on Forbes Avenue for my copy.

‘ I felt guilty — I had braved the sticky summer air
for Obi—Wan, but couldn’t take a little time away
from my computer for Thom Yorke? Star Wars has
been with me since conception, but Radiohead has
seen me through all of my adolescent and college
heartaches. Just buying the disc wasn’t enough — 1
would still have to find the time to listen to it, which
might not happen until Friday or so. It’s not like
going to see a movie ‘where you can’t escape the

, experience -— much more effort is needed to partake

in a new album. ,
And I’ve already heard most of Kid A, whereas I

‘ didn’t know much about what was going to transpire

during “The Phantom Menace.” Unlike a film, I can
listen to record over and over, without having to
shell out money each time I choose to put it on my
stereo. .

So I wavered. Four Radiohead full-length
albums, four Lucas—created Star Wars Films. One
torrid growing up experience, lots of cool droids.

In the end I had to bow down to the chains that
bind me to my homework. I’ll get it today, like the
rest of the free world, and it doesn’t make me a bad
fan, just not the biggest one.

Save me a copy.

Friars, loses to BC   

Providence beat Pitt late in the sea- 

FRAN AIELLO
Staff Writer

Taking competition to the ﬁnal

_round may not do it for the Pitt»

"women’s volleyball team if it cannot
ﬁnish.

The Panthers had their second ﬁfth-
round loss of the season this weekend.
Pitt just could not pull out a win when
the match went to aﬁfth and ﬁnal game
against an inspired Boston College.

“This team has the potential to win
those games. We just haven’t shown it
in the ﬁfth round,” Pitt head coach
Chris Beerman said.

Pitt lost to Arkansas in_a similar sit-
uation three weeks ago at the Pittsburgh
Invitational.

This most recent close loss must be
even more heartbreaking because it
came in a Big East competition, putting
the Panthers at 1-1 in the conference.

 Pitt vs. Providence

The conference win came earlier
that weekend against Providence in a
three—game sweep. In fact the Panthers

had won a total of 18 games in a row

after defeating Providence.
“That was the game I was most
concerned about,” Beerman said.

son last year but the Panthers would

’ have none of it this time around. They

won the match by the scores of 15-7,
15-12 and 15-8.-

Stacy Renick, second in the Big
East in terms of attack percentages, had
15 kills and eight digs
Providence while Marcia Thiesen had a
double—double with 12 kills, 10 digs‘
and an ace.

Heather Haff and Carrie Norris had
defensive games with 12 and 15 digs
respectively. P .

“It was a goodway to start confer-

ence play,” Beerman said.
The next day the Panthers looked to
continue their eight -game winning
streak against Boston College who
drove Pitt into the loss column with
inspired play. - ‘

Pitt vs. Boston College

Whether Pitt suffered from mental
unpreparedness or just plain bad luck,
Boston College held on to win the bat-
tle by the scores of 15-13, 14-16, 15-10,
4-15 and 15-12. '

Beerman cited lack of intensity and

poor performance in this loss.

Renick and Thiesen had 21 kills.

petition against Syracuse on Friday and

,‘Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish are _l
‘ranked 24th in the nation.

The majority of the conference is at
1-1, but Notre Dame sports a 2-0 record
and will be a big game for the Panthers.

The Pitt News

Pitt head coach Walt Harris discussed the
team’s lack of success in Syracuse since 1982 in
his weekly-press conference on Monday. , .

-He also addressed his thoughtson playing in
an environment as hostile as the Carrier ‘Dome.

“The last time Pitt won in Syracuse was in
1982, Dan Marino’s senior year,” Harris said.
“That’s a lot of losses. We are going to give it
our best shot and we will see what happens.”

Syracuse head coach Paul Pasqualoni isn’t
looking" at the past games against Pitt. He just
wants to play this year’s game because each sea-
son is different.

“I don’t think last year, the year before, or

the “year before that has anything to do with the .

2000 season,” Pasqualoni said.- “Every year is a
new year and obviously you have to play each
year.-” ’

Harris uses bye week to prepare forsyracuse

Harris also discussed the atmosphere at the
Carrier Dome,‘ which has always been known as
a tough place for opposing teams. ,

“It’s loud, it’s hot», it’s humid. They only
cheer for Syracuse, and there‘ are very few peo-
ple cheering for us,” Harris chuckled. “It makes
it hard to hear and it helps them with their two
edge rushers.’’ ‘ .1 ' 1

Last week was a’ bye week for the Panthers.
They will have another bye week after this

1 week’s game.

The week gave the players and staff a chance
to rest and get ready for the Syracuse game. Pitt
is nearly injury-free heading into the game, with
just a few minor injuries on the team. 1

It also gave Harris a chance to go out and
recruit top high school players.

“We get a little healthier. We .get some time
off for our players. It’s also good for us to get
out and recruit,” Harris said. “I think the bye

It never gets old or boring, as

Of all the pictures I carryinmy
wallet, the one I cherish most is one

Barton and Agredano
honored by Big Eas

MARIO MACHI

Sports Editor

It should be no surprise that
Pitt’s men’s soccer program received
another honor from the Big East
Conference this week, as Spencer
Barton was named Big East
Offensive Player of the Week. But it
has to be considered a pleasant sur-

prise for head coach Roland Sturk

and Pitt’s women’s soccer team to
have Annette Agredano named as the
Big East Co—Offensive Player of the
Week. ,

Barton had a hat trick against
Notre Dame Friday. He is just the
eighth player in Pitt’s history to
record a hat trick, which is three
goals in a game, and was the first
player to do so since Phil Matilla on

Barton is the third Pitt player to
receive honors from the conference
this season. Junior Chris Churchill
and sophomore Justin Gaul were
both rewarded on Sept. 11. Churchill
was named ‘Co-Defensive Player of
the Week and Gaul was named
Goalkeeper of the Week. __

Agredano, a redshirt freshman
forward, scored six points in a two-
game span last week. In a 3-2 over-
time win against Villanova,

Agredano scored‘ a goal and added an.

assist on the game-tying goal. Two
days prior to that game, she led Pitt
with -a goal and an assist in a 3-2 loss
to Rutgers. ‘ .

Agredano is the first Panther to ~
receive weekly conference honors‘

since the 1998 season. She shares the
award with Anne Makinen of Notre
Dame.

Harris also discussed the well-

He said he had picked a starter

John Turman played the entire

game against Penn State, but both

Priestley and Turman split the quar— '

game. e A
' Harris likes to coach on the spot

‘ and he said that is exactly what he

will do this week against the
Orangemen. V ’ T
“From here on in’, if you’ve seen

them so farg-i[Turman and Priestley]

then you’ll probably see them

again, Harris said about.seeing
three ‘ quarterbacks : against
Syracuse.

“We will start’ John Turman. It’s
a safe bet that Priestley will play as
well. I just’ show upand wing it. I
reserve the right to make a change
as the game goes on,” he added."

Harris also praised the defense
of Syracuse. He said that this week,
Pitt would face one of the top
defenses in the league. -. T '

“They are so good on defense.
Their defense could carry them in
games,” said Harris of the
Orangemen defenders. “They are
one of the better defenses we will

.face. Their ends put pressure on
your tackles and their insiders don’t

get enough credit for their push up
the middle.” - a

While Harris was praising the
Syracuse team, Pasqualoni praised
the. Pitt players, as well as the
coaching staff. ’

An’ alumni
Pasqualoni-knows the history of Pitt
football and‘ he knows how big this
season has been so far for the
Panthers.

“I give credit to coach Harris
andihis staff. You must be one hell _‘
of a team to beat Penn State,.”.

Pasqualoni said. “They are ﬂying
high. They have had two weeks to

get ready for us so the advantage is A

clearly‘ theirs.”
