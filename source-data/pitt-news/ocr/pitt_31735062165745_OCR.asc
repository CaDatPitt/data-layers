The U.S. Office of Education
will sponsor a comprehensive
“walk-in” exhibit of program-
med» learning and teaching
machines in’ the Commons
Room CL, Feb. 9-13.

Prepared for national demon-
sration, the four-day exhibit is
designed to bring educators and
education students up to date on

~-the uses and implications of this
_ new teaching accessory. The ex-

hibit will be open from 9 a.m. to‘
9 p.m. on Feb. 9, 11, 12, and 13.
It will be closed on Feb. 10.

The show, itself an example of

,programed,inst'ructio’n, teaches its

subject acording to the sequences
and methods used in the new
technique when applied to such
a subject as arithmetic.

Some of the displays included

in the exhibit are ﬁlms of chil-
dren at "work on programmed
learning, tapes of. student and
teacher reactions, .a walk-
through introduction to the new

teaching.”

Peterson Suggests

Adding Silence I and 2

By MARCIA BERNSTEIN

English professor Edwin L. Peterson has called
for a new set of courses to be added to the univer-
sity curriculum — namely Silence 1 and -2.

Talking to a small group of freshmen women in
1228 CL, Monday afternoon, Prof. Peterson de-
clared that he felt “it would be a good thing if
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday every stu-
dent had to go to a booth. There would be no lights
there and no books. You would just stay there for
an hour. There, you would learn more.”

, Important to Grow Up

This is part of his view that “in céllege, it is

important to grow up.” Recommended methods for

poems, but, above all, being alone.

The importance of a liberal education was
also emphasized by Peterson. According to him
-students can “get something from every class.”4
He qualiﬁed this, however, by revealing that it
is “important to try to ﬁnd inner meaning behind
the things which perhaps your teacher doesn't
say too well. We get nothing out of our classes
until we try to get from the teacher the ‘things
which he very seldom gives us.”

Peterson went on to profess that “reading is" a
rebirth.” He added that once a child learns to
read “she will not-be alone any longer and will
never see things as she once did.”

Grades and Wisdom

The correlation between grades and wisdom is
not at all apparent to Peterson. He advised those
present to “forget grades and believe in yourselves.
We need leading out, not inculeation. The only

tribute to giving out.”

Reaction to Peterson’s speech was very favor-
able. Doris Freedman, Liberal Arts ’66, declared
that “Mr. Peterson was very, very good. Every-
body is always emphasizing grades and studying
around here, but he said that you can’t learn
¢V¢!‘ything by studying. I think that Mr. Peterson
was perfectly correct when he said that you have
to be by yourself and think, because education’
is reallyvgiving of yourself instead of just ab-

sorbing facts.”

-Students Spend Wee}/.'.en.d' Thawing Out on Caribbean

  Pitt Debaters Visit Jamaica

By NANCY FUCHS

While Pittsburghers brav-
ed l8 degrees ’ below zero
weather last week, several
University debaters basked in
the Caribbean sun on the
island of Jamaica. As part of
a seven year old exchange pro-
-gram between William Pitt De-
bating Union and the University
of the West Indies, Alan Cazen,
WPDU president. Jerry Brozell,
vice president, Dick Gregg, an as-
sistant director, and his wife spent
four days in Jamaica.

The two universities have had
close ties for a long time. Gregg
ventured to say that “the people
on Jamaica probably feel closer
to our University than any other
college in the States.”

Reciprocal Agreement

Every November, the University

of the West Indies sends two men '

to Pittsburgh for a week, to par-
ticipate 0
tournament. In January, the Uni-
versity reciprocates by sending
two WPDU seniorsato Jamaica
for two public debates.
Debatingon the topic, Re-
solved:» that democracy is an‘
unsuitable form of government
for undeveloped countries, the
negative team of Gazen and
Brozell won at the university
in Kingston.
The team,

again taking the

negative view, lost .a debate. be-
fore a group of prominent towns-V.

people at .the Mandeville. The
topic was Resolved: That inde-
pendence is a myth. Gregg con-
sidered it ironic that the “Jamai-
cans who had just l:']:ome inde-
pendent last summer argued that
independence was a myth and
won.” .
More Than Tourists

The American visitors were
more than tourists. Since all ar-
rangements were taken care of by
the University of the West In-
dies, they stayed in the univer-
sity dormitories and became ac-

customed to the English eating
customs such as wearing academic
gowns for the evening meal.

“From the standpoint of cul-
tural, exchange, this was the
best arrangement that could
have been worked out," Gregg
remarked.

.“Our -hosts were wonderful.
They were eager to show us
everything. The Jamaicans turned
out in troups to do anything they
could for us,” Gregg explained.
“They are the friendliest people
I’ve ever met. They’re just not
happy unless you are,” he con-
tinued enthusiastically..

‘Time is Unimportant -

.. “Time does not worry them.
They’ll tell you to be ready at
9 p.m. and then» they don’t come
until 11,” Greg recalled. p“There
is no race distinction and many
of the customs are English.”

The debaters were taken to
the National Pantomine at
Kingston, an annual dramatic
production held during Decem-
ber and January, which people
from all over the island come
to see. This year the play was
“Finian’s Rainbow” in which
the “choreography was- great)’.
according to Gregg.

They also visited the Hope Bo-
tanical Gardens and“ the Victoria
Market on a Kingston
dock, described by Gregg as a
tourist trap with expensive trink-
ets. and cloth and a colorful.
calypso. band. “Terrific,” was
iGregg’s reaction to a steel band
which they heard. The Jamaicans
can even play classicalmusic on
their heated gasoline drums.

iMembers of the administration

all feel that the program is very
valuable to both the incoming and
the present student.

Bernard Adams, special assist-
ant to the chancellor and a con-
sultant to the committee feels
“that this is one of the most valu-
able things the student body has
done in the iﬁve or sixyears he
has been here. The enthusiasm
was great. They (the current. stu-
dents) got as much out of the pro-
gram as the prospective fresh-
men.” »

“It was_marvelous, one of the
most successful things we did.
last year," Helen Poole Rush,
dean of students and admini-
strative advisor toethe commit-
tee, remarked. “The prospective
students were enthusiastic in
their response and it gave the
present students a feeling of
pride at being a part of the
University.

I Personally, N. Ronald Pease, as-
sociate dean of men feels “this is
a ‘good opportunity for interested
students to take part in bringing
in prospective students. It lets the
student feel he is taking a part.
It was successful last year.”

SeIf- Assignment

In an informal chat a few days ago, Professor Edwin L.
Peterson of the English department touched upon several
important factors for gaining the most from a college educa-

g tion.

Putting into words-,——which, after all, is the Professor’s

business and pleasure—some seldom discussed aspects of
. learning how to learn, “Pete” emphasized certain ideas
which deserve a much ,larger audience than that which

. gathered to hear him on Monday. r
‘ Setting aside time to think is considered to be of prime
V .. importance to Peterson. He has even urged students to as-
sign themselves an imaginary three credit course in medi-
7 tation. As he puts it, “It would be a good thing if every Mon-
day, Wednesday and Friday everystudent had to go to a
, booth. There would be no light and no books. You would
. just stay there for an. hour. There you -would learn . . . ” ,

“Pete” added that, in additin to familiarizing oneself
With"good books and poetry, an essential part of complet-
ing the job of “growing up” in college is taking the time
to be alone. Having called this a learning experience in
itself, he is calling, it is clearly seen, for students to re-
capture that ancient practice of thinking; not studying
or cramming or writing term papers, but the easy digestion
and meditation of one’s place in this University.

Meditation should not be an activity assigned to the

may be a shunned word in these harried days, but _it is felt
that it is the student’s bes_t answer to the steady ﬂow -of
lectures in which he often ﬁnds himself engulfed.

Peterson also expressed his belief that wisdom and

,high grades are not necessarily correlated. We readily

agree but, we are sure that when he asks students to “for-
get grades” they would only be willing to do so if the Uni-
versity would promise to meet them halfway on this idealis-
tic proposal. ~
Another point which he made,_ however, is strongly
echoed here. Peterson stated that it is “important to ﬁnd
the inner meanings behind the things which perhaps your
teacher doesn’t say too well.” No idealism ‘here; he has'rec-
.____o'gnized that instructors cannot fully create the educative
process by themselves." , ‘

1 The students must be inquisitive, the students_must be
active and the students must take time out of their day" to
think. . A

=  These candid thoughts of this noted professor are well
worth remembering by everyone on this campus.

Fraud, Distortion Seen

In Column on Buckley
Editor, The Pitt News:

Mr. J. Kleinberg, boy jour-
nalist, in his column, “The
Buckley Solution,” seems to

have greatly underestimated the
intelligence of his readers. His
description of the educational

philosophy of William F. Buck-

ley is about as accurate as a Bi-
ble Belt preacher’s analysis of
Darwin’s ‘theory of evolution.
Whileit would be well nigh
impossible to discuss in a, short
space. all of the mistaken dis-
tortions and outright nonsense
put forth by Mr. Kleinberg in

the course of his tortured hys-

terics, , it might be instructive
to consider a few, points.

Mr. Kleinberg distorts reality
when he accuses "Mr. Buckley of
saying that “what you learn in
the past cannotbe surpassed by
what you will learn in the fu-
ture,” or of saying that “we. can

. discover nothing new in politics,

ethics, or philosophy that ‘is
worthy.”

What .Mr. Buckley did say
was that the sum total of ethical
and moral discoveries to be

made in the future will be less‘

than the sum total of such dis-'
coveries made in the past, and
that" future thought in these
ﬁelds will consist chiefly of ap-
plying past principles to new sit-
uations. -
Mr. Kleinberg engages in
fraud when he states that Mr.
Buckley’s criticisms of “pro-
gressive education” imply a re-
turn to the “good ole switch.”
Mr.- _Buckley’s statements _on
“progressive education” are vir-
tually identical with those made

by Admiral H. G. Rickover and‘

Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins,
both of whom would probably
be quite surprised to ﬁnd them-
selves, classiﬁed as utra—rightists.

Mr. Kleinberg wallows inab-
surdity when he suggests that
Mr. Buckley claims to have “set
down the infallible rules of life
and learning” or that Mr. Buck-
ley denies the abilities of his
fellow human beings. Mr. Buck-
ley merely denies the correct-
ness of the Liberal position; this
is a far cry from a claim of in-
fallibility.

Mr. Kleinberg dives into a
sea of emotional irrationality
when he says that Mr. Buckley
is “weak-minded,” a “True Be-
liever,” and an “aberration of
mankind.” The very fact that
Mr. Buckley was invited to ap-
pear on the Midday Series ar-
gues against the validity of such
characterizations; the making of
them by ‘Mr. Kleinberg argues
strongly that his acquaintance
with good taste is casual, at best.

Those who wish an accurate,

' statement of Mr. B u c k l e y ’_s

views on education should ‘read
his book God and Man at Yale.
As for Mr. Kleinberg, he would
do ' well to remember
Rand’s dictum that “emotions
are not tools of cognition,” and
Robert C. Ingersollss sterner
admonition t h a t “arguments
cannot be answered with in-
sults.”

Wilfrid Mellors Hits

Account of His Lecture

Editor, The Pitt News: '

My attention has recently been
drawn to the report in your pa-
per of the ﬁrst of my three Mel-
lon lectures under the heading
of “Is There a Crisis in Modern
Music?” The notice was ‘clearly
intended to be generous, and its
initial statement that I am gray-
haired is, if somewhat platitu-
dinous as applied to an English
Professor, undoubtedly true.”

In the account of the lecture
itself, however, I could recog-

nize virtually no affinity be-
tween what I had thought I had
said and what I was reported to V

have said. The implication of
thisgis either that I am woe-
fully inept at self—expression, or
that your reviewer is incompe-

- tent.

I am encouraged to believe
that the second alternative is
the more probable, sincevalmost

. (but. not quite).all the report-

ing of musical events which I

have read in your paper during A

my stay here have been music-
ally illiterate, and much of it
(strictly speaking) inane. The
grotesque notice of the ,Alfred
Deller recital, a b o u t
someone wrote ‘a letterlof‘ pro-
test, was merelylone example
among many.

I’m not claiming that it is of
earth—shaking importance that I
s h o u 1 d be misrepresented,
though Beethoven ~—— some of
whose words were attributed, in
garbled form, to me —. would
certainly take a less lenient
view, were ‘he not dead.

In the interest of the Univer-

. sity, however, I would like to

suggest that in the future the
reporting of musical and (hea-
ven save us) “cultural” events
should be entrusted to, people
who have a minimum basic un-
derstanding. of what they’re
writing about or, alternatively,
that such events should not be
noticed at all. .
 A university paper should
surely support the function of a
university, part of ,which is to
guard against, not to foster, the
tabloid non-thisking of. jour-
nalese — to help conquer the
Space. within the mint‘ and
senses, as well as that in the ex-
ternal universe.

Sports Cars,  
The Desirable

, nimals
By Joel Filner

The sound of the streetcars
on Fifth Avenue late ‘at night

6

are usually the most distinctive_,, __

the night. But to me, these rum-
b 1 i_ n g s are
drowned out
a n d replaced
by the sounds
of th e sports
ca r s roaring
f r o m traﬁic
light to traf-
ﬁc light. ',

As th y sit
at the light
u n cl e r . my
_ _ window, the
anxious gunning of their engines

 

brings me‘ out of my sleepy daze
and my tired mind struggles to
recognize themake, model, color,
exhaust system, transmission,
and cost of the symbol of the
“free life.”

My one desire in life (right
now at any rate), is to own one
of those'.“cute little cars.” I’ve
been looking at them for the
last two months, drooling at the
sight of Triumphs, Austin Hea-
lys, Sprites, MGs, Mercedes, and
a Morgan or two as they sit
parked on Bigelow Boulevard.

Why Would Anyone?
Why?- Why would
want a car that is drafty, noisy,

anyone

_ . , , ' '8
and easily recognizable noises of ~

all

expensive, small, crowded, tem- »

peramental, and difficult to re-
pair? Why‘ would any one pay
a ridiculous price for a used car

that would enable ‘the buyer to *

purchase a brand ne.w,American
compact for a few dollars more?
Or, for that matter, a used late

.14,

model American convertible that A

doesn’t have all those incon-
veniences? .

The one stock answer to all
these question is “for Fun.” The
major point of r.etort is that ‘the
small car is a lot of Fun. It is
cheap to run, that’s part ofthe
Fun. Only two can ride at one
time. That’s the most Fun. Fitt-
ing ten in one of them is dan-
gerous but is quite a bit of Fun.
In fact, bragging how many you
can get into_ one is Fun. _

Not to Be Driven

The serious owner will come
back with the ‘statement: “I
want a car _that_ I can drive, not
be driven by.’’_ Handling, en-
gine performance, and the op-
portunity to". choose the right
gear at" the right time allmake

- the sports car‘ a very desirable

animal, compared to the over-
"‘buses” produced‘ in
America. _ -_ ,

Status,’ a term popu-larizedi by

. Vance . Packard, is ‘also .-part of

the desirability of the_3-sports

car."I want one ofthese cars for .

all of these reasons but, most of
all, I want to keep someflotherl

Squashmen Host
Navy Saturday At

The squash’ team has another
tough match Saturday as the Mid-
shipmen of Navy invade the Fitz-
gerald Field Housocourts. The
Panthers have compiled an unim-
pressive 0-3 record on the road
against superior competition.

Navy has already defeated the
University of Pennsylvania team,
6-3. The same Penn team annihi-
lated the Panthers 8-1 earlier this
season.

Coach Ben Pope has been dis-
couraged by the lack of interest
in squash and commented that
not enough tennis players have
gone out for theiteam. “It’s much
easier to teach a’ boy who has
played tennis than to teach a boy
who has had no experience in a
racquets game,” said Coach Pope.

Pope added, “This is primarily
an academic school and there
aren’t enough athletes.” The Pan-
thers, however, have lost to
schools like Princeton, Penn, and
Army which are fine academic

Tonight; Titans Next

,Cagers Seek Win

For Tourney Berth

By ART FLEISCHNER

The basketball team will be
seeking their 13th and 14th
wins this week as well as a
bid to the National Invitation-
al Tournament. The loss to
West Virginia, and the com-
petition of other teams seeking
berths in the NCAA tournament
make the Panther hopes slim of
making this post-season tourna-
ment. , ‘

A win tonight against Fordham
and another against Westminster
on Saturday are almost a must if
any post-season games are to be

‘considered, Tonight’s contest will
following a‘

start at 8:45 p.m.,
game between Duquesne Sand
Bethany. , ,

iCoach Johnny Bach will bring
his version of the Yankee’s M&M
boys, Jim Manhardt and’ Bob
Melvin. Last season these two
were all that kept Fordhama re-
spectable team.

Sophomores Help 1

This season, however, they are
helped by sophomore John Stev-
ens, a 6-5 high jumper. Stevens
will team :with 'Melvin, 6-3, and
Manhardt, 6-4 in the frontcourt.

'Deans Prepare Study

Francis S. Cheever, M.D.
School of Medicine in a study,

represented the University’s
“Medical Education in Penn-

- sylvania: Past, Present, Future,” prepared by a committee of

deans of medical schools in the state at the request of the

Joint Appropriation Committe

e of the Legislature and the

Council on Higher Education of the Commonwealth of

Pennsylvania. The study shows°
the condition of Pennsylvania's
medical schools.

The report states that though “a
signiﬁcant portion of the ﬁnancial
support of the medical schools in
Pennsylvania, is derived from tax
sources,” it relates the ﬁnancial
problem to the provision of an
adequate supply of physicians to
meet the health needs and edu-
cational requirements of residents
in the State. 

Operational Suppoft

The report went on to state,
in opera-
tional support will be necessary if
the quality of instruction is to be
improved. For
comparative purposes, it should be
noted that most of the -medical
schools in the Commonwealth
have operation budgets below the
national average.

Deserving students need as-
sjstance in meeting the mount-
ing costs of medical education.‘
In addition, graduate, postgrad-
uate, and continuing education-

Job Directory
Available
For Students

A comprehensive list of 1485
organizations in the United States
that are willing to hire college
students this summer have been
placed in the 1963 “Summer Em-
ployment Directory.”

Also included in the directory
are speciﬁc jobs with salary, name
of employing official, and sug-
gested procedure for making ap-
plications.

The locations of these jobs vary
from summer camps and hospitals
to resturants and various depart-
ments of government. They are
available for all classmen, fresh-
men through graduate. Upper-
classmen may ﬁnd jobs in their
ﬁeld of study. ‘

Employers are listed in the di-
rectory at their own request and
invite students to apply directly to
them.

The “Summer Employment Di-
rectory” may be obtained for $3
from the National Directory Serv-
ice, Dept. C, Box 32056, Cincinnati

‘sure maintenance. and

al programs should be expanded
and supported. All these factors
are essential. to maintaining and
increasing the high quality of
medical education in‘ Pennsyl-
vania according to the report.
Concerned with the need to as-
improve—.
ment of medical education in the
State, the report points out that
“outstanding students are often
attracted into other careers which
do not require as great an ex-

penditure of time and money as

medicine. Many prospective stu-
dents are loathe to incur ‘debt be-
cause of the difficulties in repay-
ing the income of a career which
has a relatively short period 0
productivity. 1
Numerous Factors

“Although "there are numerous
factors which inﬂuence the choice
of a career, the cost appears to be
one of the most important. It
would thus seem wisest to keep
the expense to the medical student
at a minimum if thisjprofession is
to compete in attracting highly
qualiﬁed individuals. Any increase
in costs should be met in some
fashion other than by increasing
tuition,” the report states.

There must also be steady im-
provement in the salary scale of
medical school faculty, the report
shows, if capable teachers will
enter this branch, of education.
