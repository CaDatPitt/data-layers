34 Percent Of
Freshmen Will
Graduate-—Held

Survey By Personnel Adviser
Blames Faulty Adjustment
For Student Casualties

Wants Abilities Probed

“Only 34 per cent of all freshmen
who enter college are expected to
graduate," a former member of the
University faculty, Dr. Walter B.
Jones, at one time head of the de-
partment of research in higher edu-
cation, has determined,

A survey conducted by Dr. Omar C.
Held, personnel assistant to tl1e dean
of the College, reports that many of
the remainder are struggling under
delusions as to their scholastic capa-
bilities, take the wrong courses 01' our-
ricula or fail to appreciate the type
of work for which they are best ﬁtted.

In a study published this year at
Ann Arbor, Michigan, Dr. Held at-
tempts to predict the success of Uni-
versity freshmen in their adjustment
to scholastic work. He has endeav-
ored to find what relationship exists
between pre—:-idmission data and acad-
emic achievement in the freshman
year of college.

According to educators concerned
with this problem, Dr_ H=eld’s publica-
tion is “Adequate, a.nd answers a long-
felt need.”

The author, associate professor of!
psychology at the University, believes
that much disappointment would be
saved if students knew beforehand‘
their chances of succeeding in college
work.

“College Education Oversold”

“There is a bare possibility that col-_
lege education has been oversold 
America,” Dr. Held states, “and in-;
dividual differences and abilities have‘
been overlooked. Youth does not seem 
to realize that there are different?
stars to which wagons can be hitch-S
ed.”

Until recently, all freshmen at the
University were subjected each year,
to a composite aptitude test supervised 3
by Dr. Held. This test has been‘
proved, he states, to be the best single 3
pre-admission factor for predicting}
general academic success. '

Students who scored an average of;
50 per cent in this test, Dr, Held has
discovered, had less than one—half of
one percent chance to make an A av-
erage in college. On the other hand,
they stood 46 chances out of 100 for
making a 0 average. Their most prob-
able grade was .93, slightly less
than C.

Freshmen who rated in the one-!
hundredth percentile in the tests were
found to hold seven chances out of
100 for making A averages, and 93
chances out of 100 to maintain pass-
ing averages. " Z “ ‘

“Admit Sure Failures?"

The composite aptitude test is no
longer being given by the University,
but, in its place. a general psychology
examination is administered to all in-
coming students. Results of this test
have been found to carry out, approxi-
mately the same trends found in the
composite test ﬁndings.

“Those freshmen who do not make a
50 per cent, or average, mark, seldom
are able to obtain passing averages
in later college work,” Dr. Held shows
in his study.

In answer to the question, “Should
a student who is predicted to be a cer-
tain failure in college he admitted?”g
Dr. Held contends that there is a§
deﬁnite need for a careful study or
analysis of each individual in order
to determine his capabilities, abilities,
health, interest, and so on,

“There must be a careful study, too,
of occupations with an analysis of
the qualifications needed and the op-
portunities present in each occupation.
On this basis, the educational machin-.
ery should be remodelled to prepare
an individual more adequately to enter
the occupation in which everything
considered, he is most likely to suc-
ceed.

Menclenhall ‘ ‘ Not Disappointed’ ’
By Student Response

The 1034 Student Chest drive netted
slightly over $2,000, according to W.
W, M.endenhall, executive secretary
of the YMCA.

Of this sum, $1,750 was collected
among undergraduates and $350 in the

professional schools, except the
School of Law which has not yet re-
ported.

Two-thirds of the money the drive
brought in is in the form of pledges.
In the ﬁrst $1,500 reported, $470 was
collected in cash. The total cash
amount is not yet known.

In all, the Student Chest through its
350 workers contacted about 2500 stu-
dents. These results show a. 10 per
cent increase in pledges over the
1933 drive.

The Downtown Division, which is
included in the Community Fund but
not in the Student Chest, netted about
$1,500, but this ﬁgure has not been
veriﬁed.

Complete auditing of the returns
will take some time, Mr. Mendenhall
revealed, and speciﬁc ﬁgures will not
be available until that is completed.

“Student Chest appreciates the
hearty fashion in which the student
body responded to the drive,” said
Homer C, Wadsworth, C35, president
of the YMCA and campaign chairman,
in a statement today. “I wish to take
this opportunity to thank the 350 and
more loyal workers who gave their
time and energy to put the Student
Chest across, The real orchids of the
drive should go to them.”

Students prominent in the drive in-
cluded: Marguerite Swank, C35,
Janet Slease, C35, Margaret Lehm,
C35, Leonard Marks, C35, Jack Ham-
merschmidt, C35, Winston McConkey,
and Vvilliam Edwards, G.

Freshman and sophomore classes
made the best response, Mr. M_enden-
hall revealed.

H.e expressed himself as “not par-
ticularly disappointed over the stu-
dent response,” and indicated that he
hoped that next year Student Chest
would approach the $4,000 mark.

1914 And 1934

66 HAT IS GOING to prevent the

same policies from bringing
the same result?” is the question
as-ked by persons who see a similarity
in the methods of European govern-
ments in 1914 and 1934.

The similarities are striking.

In 1914 great increases in military
budgets had just been undertaken, It
has been estimated that the increases
in military budgets during the year
1913 totaled about $250,000,000.

In 1934 a United Press report
states: “The French Chamber of
Deputies today approved a $374,000,000
war budget for 1935 after hearing
two speeches in which the horrors of
the next war were described and an
alliance under which the great Rus-
sian Army will fight for France if
France is invaded was revealed_

“The Japanese cabinet approved a
national budget under which the
greatest peace-time sum ever allotted
was set aside for army and navy ex-
penditures.”

In 1914 Germany and Great Britain
had reached the peak of a warship-
building competition.

In 1934 the United Press reports:
“Germany rushed plans today to mod-
ernize her air corps and train hun-
dreds of pilots. A call was issued for
all war-time pilots to enlist for serv-
ice as instructors to recruits."

In 1914 France made loans to Rus-
sia for the express purpose of build-
ing strategic railways to the German
frontier. Military railways were be-
ing rushed in the Balkans and into
Asia.

In 193-: “The Soviet government
revealed plans yesterday for a he‘-
work of strategic railways in Siberia,
north of Manchuria, to be available for
troops transport in case of war in the
Orient.”

In 1014 France and Russia had made
:3. treaty for mutual defense.

In 1934 a French minister an-
nounces: “Russia. has promised that
her solid, well-equipped army will
march with us in case France is at-
tacked.”

In. 1914 no one was satisﬁed with
the results of the wars just passed, or
convinced that these results were
ﬁnal Greece and Turkey were still
quarreling. Bulgaria was determined
to take vengeance on her late allies.
The Albanians were showing complete
H1Cé1l3aCity for s.elf-govt.-rnm,ent, Ser-
bia and Roumania were talking of the
inevitable struggle with Austria.

England and Germany were both
worried, fearful of losing their allies,
and convinced that‘: the real way to
ensure pc-ace was to ove-rawe the op-
position by a ﬁrm, united front.

50. today, in Europe a war budget
1‘€=D01‘t€1‘ Says: ‘‘It will not be France's
fault if Europe falls into the old
chaos. But France is ready. France

rgest army.”

Schools For Today

UICII-I OF THE progress anticipated

in the following editorial has al-

ready been realized in part at th-e

University. The use of moving pic-

tures in laboratory courses is one ex-

ample. So is the accumulation of pre-
cise copies of famous paintings.

The editorial in The Michigan
Daily, from which we quote a part, is
not fantastic:

The classroom is dark. You
lean comfortably back and watch

_ today’s lesson brought to life on
the silver screen. The voice of
the movie explains the principles
involved in the photographed ma-

terial. No instructor need be
present. Abstract terms become
concrete images on the living
screen.

In the not so distant future,
such a possibility may become
reality.

Prof. Howard Y, M-cClusky ven-
tures predictions for the future.
VVI’itiIlg‘ in the magazine “Educa-
tion" for this month, he says,
“It is not fantastic to prognosti-
cate that instruction in the ﬁne
arts will be enriched by the ex-
tensive accumulations of inex-
pensive but precise copies of fa-
mous paintings, Libraries of re-
cordings will bring the best mu-
sical compositions of all ages to
the average schoolroom . .

“Talking and silent motion pic-
tures will take over much of the
laboratory training in the natural
and biological sciences. Film and
sound discs will record units of
instruction and lectures by ex-
ports on every conceivable aspect
of the curriculum. Entire courses
of study will be outlined in terms
of these mechanical aids.

“Buildings will be equipped
with sound-proof audition rooms
of various sizes for purposes of
individual and group instruction.
Talking machines, radio and tele-
vision receiving apparatus will be
, standard equipment in the school
of the future . . Inequality of
instruction will no longer exist.
Every school, from country and

gleaned the inipressiontlial; the great-

village to town and city, will have
access to lessons planned by mas-
tar teachers . . .”

VVhat will become of the teach-
ers, ask some. Will they be dis-
placed by such technological ad-
vance? No, thinks Professor Mc-
Clusky. They will be freed—-
made free to lend a personal
liaml in private instruction, to
aid in -clinical, pre-professional
instruction, and adult education.

For Broad Education
OR A LONG TIME we have heard

- controversy regarding the value of
the purely cultural education in the
practical world of today.

There has been prevalent among us
the idea. that any study outside of our
immediate ﬁeld of specialization is
not only idle but useless.

Consequently we reprint the follow-
ing statement by President Roosevelt,
an excerpt from his address at VVil-
liam and Mary college:

“There is a deﬁnite place in Amer-
ican life—an important plac¢.L—for
broad, liberal, , and non—specialized
education. Every form of cooperative
human endeavor cries out for men
and women who, in their thinking
processes, will know something of the
broader aspects of any given problem.
Government is greatly using men and
women of this type—people who have
the non-specialized point of view and
who at the same time have a general
and extraordinary comprehensive
knowledge, not of the details, but of
the progress and purposes which un-
derlie the work of specialists them-
selves.”

The educator reminds us that lack
of liberal arts education has a distinct
disadvantage to the professional man
because “this is not solely a world of
enginee.'rs——nor of any kind of special-
ists. The day will come when the
handicap will certainly be a source of
bitter chagrin to him, and it may be
the cause of monetary loss.”

Banks Beiiedes
Esfhefic Appeal
Vifcifify Or" Ari

, By Edwin Banks

Everybody from the. philistine who
“doe-sn’t know nothin’ about art but
knows wliat he likes” to the profes-
sional critics, whose opinion only he
and God con1prehend—-everybody in-
dulges in observations on painting at
some time or other. The ground is
dangerous to tread upon, no doubt,
but this columnist has decided ﬁnally
to venture a step or two in the mys-
terious dark himself.

From a reading of comments by art
critics in newspapers and three or four
books of modern art criticism, I have

ness of a picture depends upon its
esthetic appeal. The rub lies in the
deﬁnition of the word esthetic.
To 1934 critics, apparently, it
means something very, very elusive
and delicate, a quality reposing only
in the minds of the artistic elect. And
this esthotic appreciation is supposed
to be divorced from the ordinary
pleasure stirred by what common men
consider beautiful or pathetic or sen-
timental.

Concretoly, the critics who select
prize paintings at exhibits seem to
shy at the portrait of a pretty woman,
a ragged little street urchin, or an old
couple holding hands. Their objec-
tion to such art is that it detracts the
attention of the art lover from the
technical merits of the painting——
color, line, chiaroscuro, balance, and
the other elements of composition.
Their praise, consequently, falls to
such artists as Picasso and Blume
whose works stimulate only an intel-
lectual (or esthetic, if you will) re-
sponse.

Just Technical Perfection

South of Scranton, for example,
while it may have technical perfec-
tion, hardly communicates any sub-
stantial quality beyond its technical
perfection. It arouses no mood, and
it has no more meaning than a Tender
Button of Gertrude Stein_ I speak
dogmatically of my own impression,
naturally, and my attitude more than
likely differs from that of profound
art students; but let it be accepted,
to the degree at least that I can sub-
mit my point.

The point is this. It seems to me
that a painting enhances its value
when it offers more than mere excel-
lence of composition. Why has the
Mona Lisa retained its popularity
through the centuries? Because it
was well painted, to be sure; but
even more than that, I think, because
Da Vinci put into the canvas the
Gioconda smile. Why is VVhistle1"s
Mother so famous? Again, because it
is more than a masterpiece of tech-
nique. Why are Corot’s landscapes:
so admired? Because they send forth}
a mood in addition to being capably
drawn. I

There is an analogy from musici
which may emphasize my idea about’
art. Wagner enjoys a much greater
reputation among music lovers today
than Mozart, The chief reason for the
preference for Wagner is, it seems to
me, that his symphonic operas have
an appeal reaching far more deeply
than enjoyment of his harmonies or
instrumental effects; his comp-ositions
are rich in mood, and they rise high
above the bounds of their form. Most
of Mozart, on the other hand, is bril-
liant arrangement of themes and
chords, and nothing more.

Perhaps these confused impressions
can be compressed into a generaliza-
tion: Art that has an emotional as
well as an intellectual appeal is
greater than art that has only the lat-
ter. I agree with the critics that a
picture is not great if it attempts to
hide poor workmanship beneath senti-
ment, I agree that a picture is not
great if it is simply p-hotographical
representation But I reiterate the
belief that a painting like South of
Scranton, which may delight the mind
but not the emotions, cannot stand on
a par with‘ a painting like the Mona

Lisa, which delights both.

Edgar Galbreath requesting action on
street car fare reduction. The Stu-
dent Faculty Association is particu-
larly anxious to do all that it possibly
can in this direction. Previous nego-
tiations by Student council met with
little success, but if this has been due
to lack of enthusiasm, I know that
the project should be re-undertaken.

If there are any immediate propo-
sals or ideas that Galbreath could
suggest to our organization, we will
be sincerely grateful. Accordingly, I
would appreciate if he could be pres-
ent at the meeting of the Executive
committee on Tuesday, November 27,

in my life," Skladany said. “Their
safety man is the fastest back in the
league and I had to outrun him to the
goal. I made it by getting in a jump
long enough to carry me over.”

Muggsy doesn’t think that sta.rs of
larger colleges make as good profes-
sional football players as do the grad-
uates of smaller schools. “When play-
ing on a team such as Pitt, for exam-
ple," states Muggsy, “you become ac-
customed to only the best of accom-

Of course,” added
you for it.”
Pitt's team this

 

best trains and stay at the best
hotels. But you can’t expect treat-
ment like that in the pro game,

“The players of smaller colleges,
who are more accustomed to bus
travel and missing out on sleep, have
a decided advantage in this respect.”

S 'ladany recommends fullback
Izzy Weinstock, halfback Mike Nick-
sick, and end Harvey Rooker as the
seniors on the Pitt team who would
most likely make good in pro foot-
ball. Weinstock, in particular, aver-
red Muggsy, ought to go over big.
“All three of these boys appear to be
tough enough to stand the extra
knocks of the pro game.”

The popular star, who was termed
the “baby-faced assassin” when he
was smacking them down for Pitt, is
putting in several of his off} hours ex-
hibiting toy football games at local
department stores.

Skladany spent last summer acting

as a counselor at a boys’ camp and
stands a chance of getting a year-
round job with the organization In
that event, Joe’s first year of pro foot-
ball will also be his last,

The star end is married and lives
at 5625 Hobart street. When asked
his opinion of married life, Muggsy
replied that it was great. “Being mar-
ried helps out the bankroll, especially
when the wife asks at each pay day,
‘Whereis the money, honey?’ ”

Skladany still has a warm spot in
his heart for collegiate football. He
most emphatically would do. it all
over again if he were just starting in
at college.

In addition to being awarded all-
American distinction last year, Skla-
dany was chosen by popular vote to
play on the all-star team of collegians
in the game with the Chicago Bears
professionals at Chicago last August.
The game ended in a 0-0 tie, with
Muggsy seeing plenty of service in
the battle.

Fresh Scrimmage
Varsity Cagers

Coach Kowallis Drills Yearling
Squad In Basket Shooting

 

A1th011gh only one week of actual
practice has been put in, the fresh-
man basketball squad has decreased
from the 40' men that reported last
Monday to 22 candidates.

Thus far in the sessions, Coach
Willie ‘Kowallis has centered most of
the time to passing, cutting, and
shooting, especially the shooting prac-
tice. “Dockey" is a ﬁrm believer in
the fact that systems and ﬁgure-eights
will be of no use if the players miss

modations in traveling. You ride the: the Shots that the Systems make avail"

able. Naturally, Kowallis will spend
some time later drilling his players
on systems, which is equally as im-
portant as the ability to shove the
ball through the hoop.

‘ The freshman squad went through
its first scrimmage of the year last
week against the varsity. Most of
the players on both the fresh and the
varsity squads were used with no
score being kept. The tentative fresh-
man team when put up against the
yarsity, was their equal in height,
if not quite the equal in playing abil-
ity. The players who started the
scrimmage were Rags Radvansky,
Myles Zeleznick, Ollie Lengyel, Van
Jones. and Johnson. Both Spotovitch
and Michelosen have been absent
from the practices due to freshmen
football drills.

The opening game for the fresh will
be played as a preliminary to the Pitt-
Bucknell tussle, December 8, against
a local high school team,

Coach Carlson Launches Another
“Win ’Em All” Campaign
With Inexperienced Team

Aiming to improve his players by
pitting them against ﬁrst class oppo-
sition, Coach Carlson’s varsity bas-
ketball team played both the McKees-
port Willigs and the Duquesne Lafay-
ettes, crack district cage teams, last
week in practice games.

In both the games no score was
kept, the practices being only for the

beneﬁt of the Panther varsity team.
It was the second time that the var-
sity scrimmaged against the Willigs
during the past two weeks. The ﬁrst
meeting at the stadium a few weeks
on fairly
even terms, but the second time the
Willigs outplayed the Panther team
very decisively, making the varsity
look extremely bad at times.

Dr. Carlson, while expecting the
Willigs to show up his team, believes
that the main reason why the varsity
did not do so well is due to the inex-
perience of the squad. According

The histology classes under the di-

veritably “no man’s land’’ all of this
week as far as timid students are
concerned. Complete cellular exam-
inations and diagnoses will be made
of the blood of the students.

Because there are so many devia-
tions from the normal, any one of the
students is certain to ﬁnd at least
three or four more or less serious
faults in the makeup of his blood. If
he discovers upon a thorough and un-
erring count that he has less than
5,000,000 red corpuscles, erythrocytes,
he may be dying of pernicious anemia.
If he has more than 7,000 white cor-

ing from peritonitis or a ruptured ap-
pendix. If he has less than 5,000
leukocytes, he can choose from a wide
range of diseases,
malaria. inﬂuenza, tuberculosis, chlo-
rosia or even a common cold are all
possibilities. However, Dr_ McKinl.ey,
though not connected with the medical
profession, will be on hand to reas-
sure the patients.

Assembly Friday

Unit Education Plan Explained
By Miss Amos At Banquet;
Year’s Work Outlined

“Our freshman women are following
the decentralized personnel education,
or the education of the individual, in
their unit system at the University,”
Said Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women, at the banquet she gave for
the Freshman Council at the Univer-
sity club, Friday night_

“The freshmen in their review of
experiences since entering school
evidenced more pleasure in becoming
a part of University life than the in-
dividual phases of it that helped to
make it so,” commented Alice Rosen-
berger, Ed35, chairman of the organ-
izations committee of WSGA,

reviewed by the freshman speakers.
Recalling the Hearth Ceremony, Jane

“The affair was so vivid we imagined
ourselves in ancient Rome.”

Other speakers were Eleanor Scan-
lon, Eleanor Sandberg, Martha Fuller,
Edith Baillie, Edith Barnett, Sarah

the Beaux Arts, Merit Panther, and

The Council is an entirely new
project at the University, and is de-
signed to replace the old system of

class representation by officers alone. .

This year the Council will be the co-
ordinating agency between the vari-
ous freshman groups.
