  Blood
drive tries
to double
donations

Parthena Moisiadis
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

The American Red Cross Club at Pitt
hopes to save twice as many lives as
it did last year.

The club launched a new cam-
paign with the goal of collectingsoo
units of blood, or 500 pints, which
translates to about 500 donations.

With the help of free food and
greater advertising through ﬂiers,
tabeling and social media, Pitt Red
Cross Club has already held two
successful drives, raising a total of
about 100 units. However, the club
still needs to raise 400 more units to
reach its goal and will extend efforts
throughout the academic year, with
the next event on Nov. 9.

Last year, the club collected about
250 units over the course of the school
year. However, Stacey Rothenberg,
the club’s president, said that the
new goal should be attainable. She is
hopeful that her committee can reach
its goal because of the incredible in-
crease in group membership this year,
from 12 to 80 active members.

Rothenberg said that donations
are currently in high demand and
that the Red Cross is suffering from
a4o,ooo. unit shortageas a result of
Hurricane Sandy, which devastated
the East Coast last week.

“After the recent storm, we need
it more than ever,” Rothenberg said.

Ian Henderson, the club’s business
manager, said that the American Red
Cross Club has teamed up with the
Outside the Classroom Curriculum
program, which is designed to en-
courage student involvement in ac-
tivities apart from classroom studies.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Despite inherent disposableness, SGB funds for see

The Student -Government Board
has funded tennis balls, costume
changes and costly honorariums,
but at a public meeting last month,
the debate was over seeds.

Plant to Plate, a studerit-run.

urban farming organization that
grows produce to donate to area
food banks and clubs, went to the
Board with a request for seed mon-
ey. After discussions on whether the
items included in the request were
“disposable,” the Board approved
$1,853.73 for the group.

Plant to Plate, which acquired
its land through a grant from the

University’s Mascaro Center for

Sustainable Innovation in 2009, de-
pends on SGB for funding and must
-navigate allocation jargon — and
other roadblocks ~—— for funds.

“We deﬁnitely needed the money

to replace some supplies and pre- ‘

pare for the winter,” said, Justin
Seaman, abiologyandhistory ma-
jor andpresident of Plant to Plate.
Seaman added that Plant to Plate

A always, gets full funding despite dis-

putes over whether seeds fall in the
“disposable”, category. _
Board member Halim Genus, for

"example, voted against the group’s

funding, arguing that seeds fell un-
der Board policy to deny disposable
items that only satisfy a one-time
use. i i it ’

tattga:,iisurvsay.,reav§ew.¢nm    

Genus did not respond to re-
quests for comment.

“Apparently if the letter of the
law was exactly followed, we would
not have been funded for things
such as seeds or compost because
they are inevitably ‘disposable,’”
Seaman said. “This is hard to dis-
agree with at face value, but, obvi-
ously, we grow things for consump-
tion by others, so al1owances_have
to be made.” »

Allocations committee chairman .

Michael Nites said thatthe com-
mittee’s denial of items based on
disposability is anything but clear-
cut.

C “There are some deﬁnite clear

posable and some really iﬂ'y things,
but it’s deﬁnitely debatable,” Nites
said, his answer indicative of the
confusion.

When reviewing requests, the
general rule of thumb is that if the
request is for a paper product, then
it’s disposable. Groups often request

‘ funds for paper products to host

cultural dinners, but their submis-
sions are always rejected.

The idea behind the disposable
item denial is that they lack value.
For Nites, the disposable argument
has become distorted over the years
and needs clariﬁcation. ,

BLOOD

Students who donate blood will now
fulﬁll the “service to others require-
ment” portion of the curriculum.

Henderson said the Red Cross.
works on a need basis.

“It is conceivable that recent dona-
tionswillbe transported to patients in
hospitals affected by Sandy,” he said.

Pitt Red Cross Club has also ex-
panded in terms of partnerships with
other campus organizations. Hender-
son said that the club strives to include
service projects in conjunction with
its blood drives, such as assembling

toy bags for trick-or-treaters at the
Children’s Hospital.While the club
has always emphasized service, this -
year, Rothenberg said‘ that it is also
concentrating on the social aspects-
ofvolunteering and donating, such as
hosting social events at Razzy Fresh
and holding pizza dinners.

“If more members are making
friends, they’re more likely to come
out and volunteer,” she said.

Rothenbergsaid thatfoodwillalso
be used as an incentive to potential
donors.To date, they’ve offered meals
from Papa John’s, Jimmy Johns and
Bruegger’s. -

Rothenberg also said that donors
thisyear can look forward to ﬁltered
water provided by the service orga— t
nization on campus, Take Back the
Tap, which promotes reusable water .
bottles. Other incentives in the past
have included raffles for Pittsburgh
Penguins tickets and Pitt sweatshirts.
4 But Rothenberg said that often-
times people don’t understand the

importance of giving blood until
someone they love is affected.

“One of my cousins had cancer,
and she hadn’t thought about donat-
ing until she needed the transﬁision.
So many people will need blood in
their lifetimes, even if it is only for
something small like low iron,” she

said.

Although the blood drives at Pitt
through the Red Cross occur about
once every month, donors are only
eligible to donate blood every eight

weeksbecauseittakestimetoreplace .

the red blood cells lost through do-
nation.

And while donations are accepted
by both Pitt affiliates and the public,
Lauren Leibfreid, a member of the
blood drive committee, said college
students constitue the highest num-
ber donors.

“It’s important to hold blood
drives on college campuses because

_ there are so many of us here and such

a high possibility of reaching people

. who can donate,” Leibfreid said.

According to Rothenberg, each
student donationcansave up to three
lives. _

“It depends on who needs “the
blood and for what,” she said.

Blood groups are categorized by
the presence of A or B antigens on
the surface of these red blood cells.
Group 0 donors can donate univer-
sally, whereas As can only donate to
other As and ABs, and Bs can only
donate to Bs and ABs. Those withAB
blood type can only donate to other
ABS, however, they can receive blood
from anyone.

Although blood types vary by
ethnicity, overall, 0 positive is the
most common blood type and is in
the highest demand.

Rothenberg said that donors
will occasionally donate two units.
Although it is rare — because there
are certainweight and height require-
ments —- the Red Cross will accept
these larger donations. Regulations
require donors to be 17 years of age,
weigh at least 110 pounds and be in
good health.

“We will ﬁlter some of the blood
back in because you really shouldn’t
be losing that much blood,” she said.

On average, a man has about 12

pints ofblood and awomanhas about V

nine, so he or she can donate about
one pint. T
Rothenberg encourages everyone
to donate, with the exception of those
who have been told not to do so by
adoctor. ~
Other reasons potential donors
wouldn’t be eligible to give blood is
if they have low iron levels, are preg-
nant, have recently traveled to certain

countries, have high blood pressure
. or take certain medications. '

Rothenberg also said that new
donors should not be afraid of the
process.

“I usually tell people not to let
needles scare them. The technicians
are all very well-trained,” she said.

Henderson said the donation cen-
ter is a welcoming place and added
that there is typically food and music.

“It’s a laid-back atmosphere,”
Henderson said.

When an individual volunteers to
donate blood, he or shewillﬁrst have
to ﬁll out medical forms. Next, a tech-
nician will measure the volunteer’s
temperature, blood pressure and
pulse. Technicians will also conduct
aﬁnger—sticktest to ensure suﬂicient
levels of iron in the volunteer’s blood.

The technician will then sanitize
the inside of the donor’s elbow and
proceed to insert a needle attached
to a bag, which collects the blood.
Rothenberg saidthatthe process lasts
on average about45 minutes. Rothen-
berg added that students should con-
sider making appointments before
their donation date at redcrossblood.
org because these individuals take
priority over walk-ins. n

Rothenberg said she hopes stué
dents will become aware of the new
changes put in place this year and will
choose to donate. ‘

“I hope that people will donate
now for the people who need it, and
hopefully people will donate for you

in the future,” she said. I

but that is the purpose for that

‘ group. They grow things, so they

need seeds. I don’t think that the
disposable rule was made with the
intent that it should be followed so
strictly,” he said.

Nites said that the word “dis—
posable” is sometimes dropped by
Board or committee members to
reject a request when “it clearly has
a larger use,” but he said that the
current allocations committee has

. tried to minimize such denials by

thinking through the requests made
by student organizations, consider-
ing what the group brings to campus
and its history of requests granted
by the committee.

“Luckily, we have years of re-
quests because we ., try to keep
groups at the same level of ﬁmding
from year to year,” Nites said. “And
then they can come and present us
with an explanation of what they
have done to deserve the increase
in funding if they are requesting for
more than usual.” '

He said in the case of Plant to
Plate, the group received a bit more
money than in past years, but it
also talked about how much more
it was contributing to campus, and
“it wasn’t all just for seeds.”

Part of the request was to expand
the group’s plot of land for the ﬁr-
ture. '

Seaman said that the Univer-
sity owns all of the land adjacent
to the group’s current plot situated
between student housing and busi-
nesses on Oakland Avenue and Sen-
nottstreet. Plant to Plate hopes to
expand into the other side in the
early spring. Part of the money re-
quested was to develop more grow-
ing area. '

“Our goal is to create a green
space that will both be productive
and serve as a community space for
residents and students,” he said.

Plant to Plate has been a student
group since the winter of 2010 and
employs about six to 15 students
during weekly shifts to work the ur-
ban farm. According to its website,
Plant to Plate’s mission is to “teach

' students how to grow their own

food, take them into the kitchen to
learn how to cook it, and then let
them give back to the community
by teaching others.”

Seaman said that the group adds
“some greenery to the grayness of
South Oakland,” which he hopes will
improve the quality of life for off-
campus students living in the area.
The plot, marked by awooden fence
and sign, provides students with the
opportunity to learn about organic
agriculture and other food-related

issues facing the community and
the nation, such as sustainability
and urban farming. .

When pursuing additional ﬁmd-
ing, as in the case of Plant to Plate,
Nites said, collaboration is key.

‘ “The fact that [Plant to Plate has]
partnered with FeelGood to give free
vegetables or to produce x, y and z
for the other group’s use is huge,” he
said. “I love when we hear groups

who say they are collaborating with —

other groups. That’s a great thing.”

Seaman said that almost all of
the produce is donated to the food
pantry at Community Human Ser-
vices, in South Oakland and that
a small percentage of the group’s
greens are given to Pitt FeelGood
— a student-run organization that
raises money to ﬁght world hun-
ger — for its Thursday delis where
sandwiches are distributed in ex-
change for donations.

Aidan Smith, president of Feel-
Good, said that Plant to Plate’s do-
nations of arugula, basil and micro
greens are “amazing” and FeelGood,
a national movement to end hunger
through sustainability, tries to seek
out locally grown produce as much»
as possible.

“Unfortunately, since the Pitt
Chapter is located in the middle of
a city, the opportunities to obtain
fresh, local greens are really lim-
ited,” Smith said.

Nites said that he believes that
groups who request funding are re-
ally in need of help from the student
activities fund. This need, he said,
often comes from service organiza-
tions.

“In my opinion, you should nev-
er have to pay to do service,” Nites

said. “We ﬁmd for these types of .

groups because, oftentimes, witho
our help, they can’t exist.”

Smith agreed with Nites, saying
that the funding of nontraditional
student organizations like FeelGood
and Plant to Plate is one of the most

‘important functions of SGB. t

“I recognize my bias here, but I
think a college like Pitt that prides
itself in the diverse interests and
abilities of its students should al-
ways be willing to put money behind
groups with a serious passion for
what they’re doing,” Smith said.

Nikki Luke, a junior environmen-
tal studies and economics double
major and member of Plant to Plate,

. said in an email that while $1,800
may seem like a lot of money, the V .

funding will allow the organization
to plant its seeds for next year and
double the size of the garden.

“For $1,800, which is less than
the cost of one student taking one
class, we can share an experience

in agriculture for an entire clu ,”l

she said. I

To decide What’s hip, look beyond hipsters

Channing Kaiser I
For The Pitt News

Let’s talk about hipsters.

Last year, I went to a party called
Potterfest. Now, if you’re as clueless
about social events as .I am, let me
straighten something out: It is not a
“Harry Potter” party. It’s also not a
party dedicated to ceramic enthusi-
asts planting ﬂowers or marijuana,
although all seem like plausible
options. No, Potterfest is so called
because the apartment at which the
shindig takes place is located on Pot-
ter Street. Creative, right?

After hearing the name, I thought
I would be in for a night of fun —

bonding with other people who_

thought Sirius Black should have
been rugged yet sexy in the movies
and who had already thought of what
objects they would use as Horcruxes
if need be. But as soon as I arrived at
the apartment and saw motorcycles
on the lawn and beer cans strewn
about, I knew I had been misled.

Actually, it was a total hipster
party. There was not a single wand
in sight.

I was a freshman back then,‘ and
the only experience I had with hip-
sters up to that point involved the
kidwho sat nextto me in high school
calculus and often walked around

i barefoot, compiling notes on loose-

leaf graph paperbecause spiral note-
books were way too mainstream and
stiﬂed his creativity — apparently,
shoes did too.
But these hipsters were different.
A Where he was just one offbeat kid,
this was an entire apartment jam-
packed with offbeat kids all wearing
chunky sweaters and chunky glasses

with cigarettes shoved between their»

red lips. ‘

If enough people are offbeat at the
same measures and with the same
rhythms, they pretty much become
the beat. The subculture becomes
the culture. Hipsters become main-
stream. Want to look like a hipster?
Buy acid-splattered denim and
slouchy plaid shirts at Urban Outﬁt-
ters —— no trip to Goodwill necessary!
Want to listen to music like a hip-
ster‘? Buy the “Breaking Dawn: Part
I” soundtrack! You’ll get everything
from Theophilus London to Thejoy
Formidable, and even better, you can
get it-onvinyl. (If you wantto listento

p it on your iPod, though, you’ll need

to invest ina pair of chunky head-
phones.) Want to watch TV like a
hipster? Forget it. Read Dostoevsky
instead. I ‘ .

The ultimate proof that hip-
sters have become mainstream is
the fact that you can dress like one
for Halloweenzskinny jeans, a shirt
that reads “Obscure Band,” Warhol
glasses, and you’re good to go. People
also dress up as lax bros and the Spice
Girls for Halloween. That should say
something significant abouttheir cli-
che status.

So now that the unthinkable has
happened and hipsters have become
as easy to imitate as Michael]ackson’s
dance moves, who do we set as our
pinnacle of unobtainable oddity and
coolness‘? Here are a couple of sug-
gestions: _

The members of the “Doctor
Who” fan club. Mix together time-
traveling‘ police boxes, sonic screw-
drivers, bowties, sarcasm and Brit-
ish accents, and you’re pretty much
brewing a potion of coolness.

Simply watching “Doctor Who”

is not enough to allow you to clinch’

the prized title of counterculture,
though. You also have to listen

to trock, an entire genre of music
dedicated to the show, and post ﬁve
memes daily on 'I‘umb1r about the
show.

The Honey Boo Boo clan. If
you’re unfamiliar with the Georgia
family members, all you really need
is their nicknames to get a picture

of who they are: Honey Boo Boo, "

Chubs, Pumpkin, Mama, Chicka-
dee and Papa Bear. And yes, these
are real people, and no, they don’t
wear Teletubby cosuirnes, although
their nicknames might deliver that
impression. They’re part of a reality
show that features exciting events
such as Chickadee giving birth to a
daughterwith three thumbs and then
Honey Boo Boo proclaimingthat she
wants anextrathumb so she can grab
more cheese balls. What’s more nou-
veau-hipster than celebrating extra
thumbs andlaughing at a society that
looks down upon rednecks?

The Pitt Ornithology Club — and
omithology clubs in general. From
Anne Bradstreet and Emily Dickin-
son to Katn_issjEverdeen and Harry
Potter, birds have; always played an
important, yet underrated, role in
literature and culture. After all, all
of Middle-‘ earth would have burned
if that eagle hadn’t rescued Gandalf.
Plus, birds are a symbol of freedom
that is slightly less cliche than Che
Guevara, the current hipster poster
boy. I can imagine “;Viva los pajaros!”
being the nouveau—hipsters’ T—shirt
slogan of choice. - ’

So, even though the hipster dy
nasty has collapsed and Potterfest

is really just a frat party masked by

indie music and big glasses, I have
hope for the ﬁiture. We just need to
redeﬁne what “ 'p” is, and as you
can see from my list above, I think
we have a lot of good options. I

ALEUM RIEWEW

Anastasio separatesfrom ‘jam band’ sound  

Pete Blais
Staﬂ Wrz'ter

Trey Anastasio

Traveler

‘Grade: B

T Sounds like:. Experimen-

tal indie jams

Guitar icon Trey Anastasio has entered the
studio once again to explore and expand
upon his wealth of musical ideologies.

Anastasio, since his early days with
Phish, has long since established himself
as a brilliant guitar player. But while Phish is
considered a “jam band” by popular culture
and music critics alike, Anastasio’s talent
extends beyond his usual display of elon-
gated solos and bubbly chords in Phish’s
music. Through Anastasio’s body of work
from his solo career — notably in studio
recording —— he’s shown his capability as a
crafty composer as well.

Anastasio’s newest album continues
his trend of experimentation and, though
I appreciate the creativity, its results are
varied. Anastasio explored a number of
different genres within the album, and the
indie sound he produced on multiple tracks
came up short more often than not.

Anastasio’s musical peculiarity began

earlyin his career with Phish and developed
a cult following that appreciated the creative
jam mentality. Anastasio’s solo career takes

this same musical concept but uses different
methods to present it. Thus, the results can
produce sounds that are similar to or that
differentiate from Phish’s brand.‘It’s clear
that Anastasio is unafraid to experiment
with his music. Anastasio’s listeners might
have an idea of _what to expect, but he usually
produces a mystery bag’s worth of music.
Tmve/eris another valiant effort on Anas-
tasio’s part, and there’s plenty to take away
from it. But it’s clear that his ninth solo
album was not a complete triumph. With
Traveler, Anastasio has said that he hoped
to create a more experimental album, using
the studio as an instrument. It’s not nearly
as far-fetched as his early solo work because
his musical intelligence has progressed. He
adequately achieves this experimental status
throughout the album with the help of pro-
ducer Peter Katis (The National, Interpol)
and several other collaborating musicians.
Experiments, however, can end in suc-
cess or failure, and Traveler has its share
of both. While it successfully creates ab-
stract sounds and melodies, it fails in its

tendency to seem too mimdane, laid—back

and almost lazy.

It’s hard to put a singular deﬁnition on
the album, but it’s clear Anastasio went a
bit indie on listeners and tried his hand
at a number of different_ techniques. His
album blends pop, reggae, alternative rock,

‘ psychedelic and several sounds in between.

The name “Traveler” alludes to Anastasio’s
journey as a musician, and the music he’s
created here tries to encapsulate that idea.
But the album lacks consistency and a cen-
tral theme. '

Unlike his typical Phish repertoire, Anas-
tasio’s guitar takes somewhat of a backseat

in his solo music. He seldom utilizes heavy
jamming and guitar solos. Instead, he relies
on experimental compositions and the sev-
eral instruments that create them. The lyrics
are also a major focus, sometimes more so
than the music itself. It’s ﬁne to ease up on
the guitar, but in certain songs there’s not
much to make up for it. For as innovative of
a guitarist as Anastasio has been throughout
his career, his guitar’s presence on this al-

‘bum does not yield results as great as those

of his past experiments. V
For instance, in a track called “Architect,”

Anastasio composes a compelling intro that‘

sounds like a rhythmic mash up of noise
— mostly electronic percussion. It sounds
like something off a Stomp soundtrack or
perhaps an architect rhythmically building a
house. But the early build up doesn’t go any-
where, and the exalting chorus resembles a
church choir. .

Anastasio also presents his listeners

with corny lyrics in “Let Me Lie,” his third

composition of this song — two appearing
on his 2006 album, Bar 7 7, and the other
appearing on Phish’s Para: Time in 2009.
The song could certainly pass as a Phish
tune, but also adds layers of organ, strings,
Xylophone and backing vocals. It carries a
soothingmelody and is also vocally driven.
It soundslike an aging, hippie father sing-
ing songs to his children. Thesong has a
nice melody but the lyrics are cheesy and
unconvincing._ V

As for success stories, “The Land of Nod,”
“Scabbard” and Anastasio’s cover of Goril-
laz’ “Clint Eastwood” highlight the album.

In “The Land of Nod,” there is an ex-

Family of the Year

Lorna Vista

Sounds Like: Grouplove, The Beach
Boys’ 21st—c_entury nephew, Edward
Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros" less-
.folksy first cousin

Grade: B+

Steven Tyler thinks they sound like The Ma-
mas & The Papas on acid. That’s not a bad
image for an up—and—coming band to wield,
and it’s hardly the only praise Family of the
Year has received since its inception in 2009.

The band’s ﬁrst feature-length album,-

Lama ,l/irta, has met very little negative feed-

back since its-_ release this past July, and its '7
preceding EPs were also lauded by the typi-

cally critical indie music community. The
overwhelmingly warm reception Family of
the Year received into this not—so—warm—and—
fuzzy industry presents an obvious question:
Are they really that good?

Not quite. Family of the Year could be an
anomaly of sorts, but it seems more likely
that this happy family. has yet to receive its
inaugural beating only because its music has
not yet been fed to the’ sharks.

Lmzm I/zkta will eventually meet the more
critical ears of music reviewers and related
company. -But for the time being, I’ll take on
the role of the shark.

The band’s music exudes high degrees
of conﬁdence and exuberance. No level of
detachment exists in this music, and no one
could question the sincerity of these musi-

cians. One need only grant Lama Vjrtaa single
listen to understand that band members Joe
Keefe (vocals, guitar), Sebastian Keefe (drums,
vocals), James Buckey (guitar, vocals) and
Christina Schroeter (keyboard, vocals) are

Vtruly_content playing and producing their

music together.

I have no reason to deem their content-
ment unwarranted. They’ve undoubtedly ac-
complished a lot in a short amount of time,
and theirfuture looks promising.In only three
years, they’ve produced four EPs and a studio
album; toured with Edward Sharpe & The
Magnetic Zeros, Mumford 8: Sons, Grouplove,
Ben Folds and others, and played sold-out
shows across Europe, the U.S. and Canada
— including a set at France’s largest music
festival, Les Vieilles Charrues. The band is
currently on the road with Walk the Moon,
White Arrows and Hey Ocean! and made a
stop in Pittsburgh on Nov. 4.

Family of the Year, however, has a tragic
ﬂaw. Loma T/ista is a collection of indie, dance
and psych rock with a jangly, dreamy indie-
pop sound. This sound is mostly pleasant,

ebullient and dripping with California vibes,
but it might be a bit too sunny.

I appreciate the upbeat, honest nature of
the songs. Ebullience is a refr/eshingwchange
from the pervasive melancholy thatseems
to plague the indie rock genre. But Family of
the Year’s bright and shiny chords and hooks
hardly seem appropriate_for winter indul-
gence or rainy days.

Lama Viva is ideal for a summer road trip
down the Paciﬁc Coast Highway. The tracks
evoke images of friends enjoying a long drive
in ajeep or convertible or possibly sharing a
few beers around an ocean—side campﬁre.

Those are certainly pleasant scenes that
many people can relate to, at least to some ex-
tent. Outside of such contexts, however, these
tracks are not so easy to stomach. Listening
to them while wearing a fall coat and scarf
feels a bit awkward, and listening to them at
the height of a brisk, biting Pittsburgh winter
would likely feel downright uncomfortable ——
a notion that will be easy to conﬁrm within

Self-titled ’
album dark
with potential

Grace Kelly
Stcyj‘ Wrz'ter

The Carpet Squares

_ The Carpet Squares

Grade: B

Sounds like: A pared down ver-
sion of The Killers with darkly
humorous lyrics similar to those of
The Smiths.

The Carpet Squares’ new album is ﬁlled with

dark humor that portrays deep concepts

and captivating sounds with the potential
to form great music — even if it missed the
mark this time.

The Carpet Squares is a two—man band
whose honest lyrics have darkly comical
tinges that create a pensive, yet strumming,
track ﬂow.

The band opens its self—titled album with
the relatable “Cubicle Queen,” a song that,
in its melancholy, reﬂects the routine of a
woman in her cubicle — the utilitarian of-
ﬁce space holding so much of her life. The
band members sing about this woman as

‘being “high on caffeine, plotting revenge

onythe copy machine” —- an understand-
ablevsentiment for those who have worked
as corporate drones.

The Smiths—esque humor found in The
Carpet Squares’ lyrics is constructed around

‘ a slow beat with eerie, synth vocals that re-

ﬂect a more complex concept regarding the
depressing and constricting grips of office
life. V

The rest of the album continues this
rather dreary outlook with songs such as
“Independence,” “W I” and “WHYGTL? (What
Have You Got To Lose?)” that reﬂect the bro-
ken lives of people whose dreams have never
blossomed. There is a feeling of despera-
tion and resignation that emanates from the
songs’ slow pace and monotonous vibe.

In these tracks, the nasal-sounding vocals
tinged with synth-echo effects are reminis-
cent of Brandon Flowers’ —- the voice be-
hind The Killers —— but without the heavy,
fast beats characteristic of the band’s music.
While this pop inﬂuence is evident, other
songs, like “Saloon,” show sparks of blues
rock» and jazz, creating a slow but deep cas-
cade of musical rhythms. “Saloon” renders

— atone similar”to that of-a ballad and tells

the story of a poker match in a smoky bil-
liard room.
The Carpet Squares have what it takes to

i create grade—A music, but they might need
to adopt a wider, range of vocal projections

andrcreate more cdistinction betweeneach

 track to truly ﬁndisuscess. Li S .

Health care an issue for independent musicians

John Lavanga
WPTS Contributor

On Oct. 19, Stefan Alexander — better known
as the goofy, punk—inspired, anti— establish-
ment rapper P.O.S. —— sat down in front of a
video camera to record a brief message for his
fans. The subject was an emergency cancella-
tion of his upcoming tour, set to begin Oct. 22.
Wearing a knitted purple hat and bright plaid,
he opened his address with a greeting and a
wide grin, then took a deep breath, buckled
down and explained his situation.“I’m sorry. I
need a new kidney.” After a pause, he clariﬁed.
“I need one new kidney. Both of my kidneys are
garbage. They’ve been going bad since I was a
teenager.” He went on to explain his original
plans to bring a dialysis machine with him on
the road and the way in which his deteriorating
health caused those plans to fall apart.

For most independent musicians, any med-
ical setback — let alone something as grave as
constant dialysis and transplantation — can
be damning news. A survey conducted in 2012
by the Future of Music Coalition, a musician

. advocacy group, found that 33 percent of sur-

Veyed musicians did not have health insur-
ance. This ﬁgure was nearly double the average
number of uninsured among the American
populace at the time of the survey, and it ex-
empliﬁes the instability and uncertainty that
comes with living as an independentmusician.

I

win I

Throughout the video of his announce— a

ment, Alexander chuckled and tried to choke
back bitter grins. It’s strange to watch grave
news being delivered with such a calm de-
meanor, and itbecame apparent that he wasn’t
quite sure how to deal with, let alone explain,
this particular setback.

“I need a new kidney.” He repeated this
again and again, like he couldn’t quite believe it
himself, like this traumatic news hadn’t sunk in
yet. And so he chuckled. What else could he do?

In an interview with Time Magazine on
Alexander’s condition, Neil Portnow, presi~
dent of the Recording Academy, was quick
to note that using such emergency medical
issues for musicians are “nothing new.” Many
low—release independent artists experience
ﬁnancial instability and hardship even after
their supposed breakthroughs. Alexander’s
Rhymesayers label-mate Brother Ali is one ex-
ample. As a man who appeared to be on his way
up following the release of his well—received
2004 EP C/aazygzbion, a couple setbacks and a di-
vorce quickly left the gifted rapper temporarily
broke and homeless while he recorded his next
album, Um2'z'.y>m‘ed. Both Alexander’s and A1i’s
ﬁnancial and medical hardships exemplify the
sort of struggle supposedly “established” mu-
sicians can often experience. The instability
of their occupation creates the possibility of
a rapid downward spiral should the smallest
setback occur.

Despite all of these challenges, certain
organizations exist that are dedicated to
helping musicians in need of health care ——
emergency or otherwise. MusiCares is one
of these organizations and is dedicated to
providing emergency assistance to ailing mu-
sicians for issues ranging from the ﬁnancial
to the medical. MusiCares also offers the sort
of basic medical screenings, from dental ex-
ams to mammograms, that are important in
catching major problems during their early
stages in order to avoid costly medical disas-
ters that plague so many musicians. Another
organization that exempliﬁes the miniscule
safety net created by the music community
is the Oregon—based Musicians Emergency
Medical Association, which strives to provide
Oregon musicians with funds in the event of
a medical emergency. '

But organizations such as MusiCares and
MEMA are few and far between. At best they
are only stopgap solutions to a widespread
problem, and beneﬁt concerts will never take

the place of the comprehensive medical cover-

age that so many of these musicians lack.’ Of-
tentimes, musicians ﬁnd themselves resorting
to beneﬁt concerts in order to deal with these
issues. This is a well—established practice in
the music ‘community, and beneﬁt concerts

show it on the battleﬁeld. Counter moves
frequently involve a slowing camera effect
that brings the player close to the attack.
Players of the game will, at some points,
feel pity for their victims as they witness
the horror that slowly spreads across their
enemies’ faces as Connor grasps them and
hacks at their chests with a hatchet.

This violent realism is not conﬁned to
counter attacks. Connor has a range of tools
at his disposal to deal with enemies. One of

‘ note, the rope dart, allows Connor to stalk

enemies from above and, when ready, noose
them. Once an opponent is caught in the
noose, the player has the choice to stran-
gulate from above or to drop to the ground,
hoisting the enemy in the air.

This sort of realistic violence, coupled
with the unﬂinching telling of our nation’s
history, sends a consistent message through-
out the game: “Assassin’s Creed III” is not
afraid to be accurate. .

And this bravery pays off. “Assassin’s
Creed III” is a brilliant game. Its fantastic
gameplay, graphics and story ﬁrmly place it
in any serious Game of the Year conversation.
The game is risky in the best way possible,
challenging the player to reconsider history
and inspiring self-loathing as he or she cuts
down enemies. “Assassin’s Creed III” does
so all while simultaneously telling a captivat-
ing narrative and engrossing the player with
beautiful, cinematic violence. I

The ’6os inﬂuence on this music is quite
overt, but it only works in some instances.
Some of the verses have catchy, free-ﬂovving
lyrics and chords reminiscent of The Beach

of ’80s alternative rock. The music video for
“St. Croix” on-YouTube has been completely,
bombarded with comments noting the song’s
relentless presence in Hollister stores.

° The song is farmore aesthetically pleasing
than Hollister’s clothing, but it’s no musical
victory. “St. Croix” epitomizes the band’s mu-
sically immature, less-reﬁned side — which
fortunately is not the only side we see on Lama
l/z'sta'. If all of the lyrics on this album paral-

leled “St. Croix”’s chorus — “You bring the A

ocean / I’ll bring emotion / Togetherwe’ll make
a loveppotion” —+ Family of the Year would
have some more serious issues to overcome.

The band members all lived together in a
run-down, one-bedroom apartment on Lorna
Vista Place in Los Angeles while making the

album. During this period of cohabitation, the
band members claim they developed unbreak-
able bonds and sincere love for one another.
Their true familial nature supposedly trans-
lates into a charming, captivating stage pres-
ence. The strength of their live performances
has been so widely recognized and consis-
tently applauded that attending one of their
concerts seems like a worthwhile venture.‘

Few experiences are greater than attending
a concert where the entire audience can’t keep
from dancing, so Family of the Year deserves
credit where it’s due. At the end of the day, it
might not produce music of the highest cali-
ber, but this family is good at makingthe type
of music it makes, and it will surely develop a
passionate fanbase. I

ANASTASIO

perimental percussive intro that’s eventually

joined with horns that incorporate a ska-like '

reggae element. The intro progresses to a
chaotic, rhythmic, up—tempo sound. It even-
tually gives way to Anastasio and his backup
singers as they enter with a softer, easy-
ﬂowing piano about two minutes into the
song. The tune continues with this peaceful
awakening until it concludes with the same
horn feature, reminiscent of the classical
masterpiece, “In the Hall of the Mountain

' King” — a catchy tune to say the least.

“Scabbard” is- by far the album’s greatest
triumph. It’s groovy, trippy and Zappa-esque.
The piece’s structure, in episodic composi-
tional form—.- goingfrom one musical idea

” or theme to another — is clearly a shout

out to his predecessor and rock idol Frank
Zappa. It’s as if Paul McCartney decided to
take a trip to the wild side. The song contains
several musical parts and compositions, even
changing time signatures and chord sequenc-
es on several‘ occasions. It also features ‘a
Xylophone mimicking a guitar progression,
marimba, Vibraphone and other percussive
‘instruments —— all of which are Zappa-styled
elements. It manages to blend together quite

. nicelyregardless of the number of musical el-

ements Anastasio employs. There are parts of
-vintage Anastasio — episodic composition
format —— newer Anastasio —— incorporating
many different sounds,‘perhaps relating to
his orchestral inﬂuence —— and even some
uncharacteristic Anastasio as he adds effects

to his vocals, but the end result is-a good one. ..

, Anastasiois all over the map, covering all
kinds of musical ‘ground. Be forewarned: Not

every song is worth exploring. Any listener

who is open to experimentation and is a fan
of Anastasio’s peculiarities mightjust enjoy
this album. I

Well—known indie rock musician and pro-

found that his single—payer health insurance
would not cover therapy for his newborn son’s
spinal muscular atrophy disease, he turned to
the music community, and there were several
beneﬁts to assist in paying for the expensive
treatment. Spinal muscular atrophy is incur-

As for Alexander, his search for a kidney is
over. After reaching_ out to his fanbase using
social media, he found an appropriate donor
and has received hundreds of donations from
around the web. It’s a practice that has gained
popularity and momentum in the era of crowd-
sourcing, and it seems to be the digital—age de-
rivative of the long tradition of beneﬁt concerts
and fundraisers — those which musicians have
relied upon for decades to help them through
difficult medical situations.

Thanks to these contributions, Alexander
appears to be all set to undergo the operation.

Though he has health insurance, his cov-

degenerative kidney disease, is insufﬁcient to

plantation, let alone living expenses for the
subsequent recovery. His only hope now is
that he can recover quickly and get back on

Panthers dominate against RMU

in last nonconference match

i,

Torie Wytiaz
Senior Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

just before two pivotal Big East
contests this weekend, the Pitt
women’s volleyball team looked
to build momentum in its ﬁnal
nonconference match of the year
Tuesday night against Robert
Morris.

The Panthers swept their 10-
cal rival in three straight sets by
scores of 25-20, 25-17 and 25-12 at
the Fitzgerald Field House.

With the victory, the Panthers
improved to 15-13 on the year.
Their 5-8 conference record has
them currently sitting in ninth
place. The top eight teams earn
a berth in the conference tour-
nament. .

According to senior outside
hitter Alexa Campbell, the Rob-
ert Morris match was a chance
to earn a victory against a cross-
town opponent.

“This was an important match,
being our last nonconference
match of the season,” Campbell
said. “It’s always exciting to play
at home against another Pitts-
burgh rival to prove ourselves.”

The Panthers dictated the
pace of the match from the ﬁrst
set. After battling to a 6-6 tie,
the Panthers moved ahead after
a kill by sophomorejessica Wynn

 and never relinquished the lead.

Building an advantage and
then maintaining it has been an
issue in Big East play, and to ju-
nior Monica Wignot, keeping a
sharp focus throughout the game
was key to reversing that pattern
Tuesday.

“I think the most important
thing is to be staying focused
from beginning to end and every
point and closing out the game

__ when it gets to 20,” Wignot said.

The Panthers recorded 14 kills
while holding the Colonials to
only ﬁve, and once again, Pitt led
the set wire-to—wire. Pitt out-hit
Robert Morris 17-13 in the open-
ing set, with Wignot contribut-
ing ﬁve. '

For junior setter and defen-
sive specialist Maria Nicholas,
the Panthers demonstrated their
control of the match from the

ris Tuesday. Huailei Wang | Senior Staff Photographer

onset.

“We did a really good job of ex-
ecuting our game plan,” Nicholas
said. “We never let Robert Morris
get on a run, and we controlled
the entire match.” _

The Panthers never trailed in
the second set, and the ﬁnal 25-
17 score represented their big-
gest lead. Campbell led the team
with ﬁve kills while sophomore
Kate Yeazel earned three of the
team’s ﬁve blocks. The Panthers
earned eight total blocks to the
Colonials’ four.

‘ Blocking has been a focus
for the Panthers all season,
and Wignot saw the impact that
blocking had on her team’s of-
fensive performance.

“Our blocking has improved
all season, and we need to have
good blocking so our defense can
form behind us,” Wignot said. “If

we do that, we always have a good
outcome.” W

With their most dominant
performance of the match pres-
ent in‘ the third and ﬁnal set, the
Panthers secured the overall vic-
tory. Campbell led all players with
her ﬁve kills while senior libero
Margy Acton contributed three
aces to the Panther’s scoring.
Campbell totaled a match-high
15 kills, and Wignot also tallied
double—digit kill ﬁgures in the
match with 10. No Robert Mor-
ris players recorded more than
eight kills.

Defensively, Acton_ led the
match with 16 digs while Del-

aney Clesen chipped in with‘

nine. Sophomore setter Lindsey
Zitzke ﬁnished the match with
19 assists, and freshman Jenna

potential for long
  playoff run

Nate Barnes
Staff Writer

Four weeks ago, the Pittsburgh
Steelers lost to the Tennessee Ti-
tans. _

Titans Kicker .Rob Bironas
nailed a 40-yarder as time expired

I to give his team the win and drop

the Steelers to 2-3 on the season.

That kick also fueled those
quick to describe the Steelers as
old, washed—up and devoid of their
juggernaut status from the mid-to-
late 2000s. 0verall,<a variety of
ridiculous statements were being
made through the Pittsburgh and
national media.

Sixweeks ago, after the Steelers-

lost to the Oakland Raiders 34-31
on a ﬁeld goal by Sebastian Jan-
ikowski as time expired, the Steel-
ers had. a 1-2 record.’I wrote that
the Steelers were going to be just
ﬁne despite the shaky start and
that Steeler Nation should not fret.

Now, with the Steelers hav-
ing hit the season’s halfway mark

Sunday following their third con- ‘

secutive win — 24-20 over the New
York Giants — I just hope that you
all listened to me.

After losing to_ Tennessee’,
the Steelers beat division rival
Cincinnati 24-17, overcoming an
11-point ﬁrst-quarter deﬁcit. The
next week, Pittsburgh dismantled
Robert Griffin III and the rest of the
Washington Redskins en route to
a 27-12 victory at home.

Most recently, the Steelers
battled from behind on the road
in New York to knock off the de-
fending Super Bowl champions in
an environment charged with emo-
tion as a result of the devastating
effects Hurricane Sandy had on
the New York metropolitan area. ’

A phantom pass-interference
call-coupled with a ﬂag on Ryan
Clark for helmet-to-helmet contact
with Giants receiver Victor Cruz
— even though Cruz hurt his ribs
on the play, which makes no sense
from an anatomical perspective
.—‘ gifted the Giants a touchdown
in the ﬁrst quarter. And New York

quickly stacked another touch-
.down on top of that one with a
fumble recovery by Michael Boley
off a pass from Steelers quarter-
back Ben Roethlisberger.

In the third quarter, New York
added six more points to lead Pitts-
burgh 20-10 heading into the ﬁnal
frame. The Steelers then put up 14

points in the fourth quarter, scor- .

ing on a 51-yard toss from Roethlis-
berger to Mike Wallace and a late
touchdown run from Isaac Redman
that gave the Steelers the lead for
good. 4 1 °

So, what has been working for

' this Steelers team?

‘You have to start with the de-
fense. Pittsburgh is the NFL’s top
unitagainvst the pass, giving up
only 174 yards per game through
the air — by far the best mark in
the league. _

Against the run, the Steelers
aren’t at the top of the league as
one might expect, but they are
still tied for seventh place, giving

‘ up a respectable 88.6 yards per

game. Overall, the Steelers lead
the league in total defense at only
262.6 yards allowed per game.

And in today’s day and age
when the quarterback has become
the most important position on
the ﬁeld for most teams, I would
rather see the Steelers lead the
league in pass defense than run
defense. Usually if teams cannot
throw, they cannot score.

Alongside the defense, the of-
fensive line has played the best
offense Steeler Nation has seen
since Alan Faneca and Jeff Hart-
ings anchored the front line.iAs a
result, the running game is seeing
the largest dividends come its way.

Over the past three games, the
Steelers toppedloo yards rushing
with two different running backs
— Jonathan Dwyer and Redman
— against defenses that were per-
forming quite well against the run.
And when Rashard Mendenhall
recovers from his injury, the three-
player combo will strike fear into
opposing defenses.

WORDS OF WiLSON

For fans, weak nonconference basketball schedule stinks

Jasper Wilson
Assistant Sports Editor

With the start of basketball season upon us,
the time has come for students to assume their
place inside the Pete and spur their Panthers
on to victory against such powerhouses as the
Kennesaw State Owls.

The Kennesaw State Owls that won a mere
three games last season? Yeah, those Owls.
Joining the Owls as Pitt’s willing victims in the
category of “guarantee games” —— one—game
contracts that involve compensation for the
weaker school —— are schools such as Delaware
State and Howard. The latter is known as the

alma mater of former Supreme Court Justice '

Thurgood Marshall and Pulitzer Prize-winning
author Toni Morrison more than it is known
for its current sporting prowess.

The ﬁrst two months of this seasonwill test
spectators’ attention spans — if they decide to
show up —— because many victories with wide
margins should occur. Kennesaw State has only
been a Division I program since 2005.

The Oakland Zoo has a built—in system
to discourage students from passing on the
non—marquee games and to reward those who
attend.

Loyalty points increase the likelihood of
receiving a ticket when the demand is greater

/«4»

than the supply, i.e., during conference play.
Students earn two points when they attend a
game during which the Zoo isn’tfull andone

point when it is, according to the description‘

listed in the student tickets section of my.pitt.
edu. C
Detroit assistant coachjay Smith and Ken-

nesaw State assistant coachjimmy Lallathin

declined to release details regarding the com-
pensation their programs will receive frorn Pitt.
r But what about the other fans who have no

incentive to attend these games, such the
. seasonticket holders? Last year’s average home

game attendance within the ﬁrst two months of
the season — counting the City Game —+ was
approximately 8,741 people, although at times

 

it seemed like much less. The Pete has a seating
capacity of 12,508 people for basketball games.

For a fan, the nonconference schedule be-
longing to the Pitt men’s basketball team this
year isn’t exciting. But head coachjamie Dixon
knows what he’s doing, and according to Sports

Illustrated’sLuke Winn, “he’s the best coach in 1-

the country at it.” In his article “Scheduleball:
Colorado State, Pitt exploit weaknesses of RPI,”
Winn singled out Dixon as a master manipula-
tor of the nonconference scheduling process.

“Pitt’s Jamie Dixon is rarely lauded for his
scheduling — if anything, the knock on him
has been that he doesn’t schedule hard enough
when he has an elite team — but here, he looks
shrewd. He’s the best coach in the country at

consistently turning a mildly efﬁcient [Non

Conference Strength of Schedule] into a re-
spectable NCSOS in the eyes of the RPI [Rat-

ings Percentage Index], and thus, the [NCAA 1’

tournament selection committee] .”

RPI is a formula that combines a team’s
winning percentage, its opponent’s winning
percentage and its opponents’ opponent’s win-
ning percentage.

This creative navigation of a complicated
system is great if you’re Dixon or a member
of the actual team. But without difficult or at

least intriguing home games on the schedule,

spectating becomes boring.

Last year the atmosphere at the game
against midmajor school and eventual NCAA
tournament team Long Beach State was mark-
edly better because of the game’s level of com-
petition —— a 86-76 defeat. This brought out
the Zoo’s full effort in a way that the 89-56
season opener against Albany — also a mid-
major — didn’t. ‘

Of the teams Pitt will face at home before

opening Big East play, only two teams — De— .
’ trait and Lehigh, given that it defeats Robert

Morris — potentially made it to the NCAA tour-
nament this past March. Two more, Bethune-
Cookman and Robert Morris, made it to their
conference championship games.

According to Pitt’s ticket office, the student
ticket process will be the same_for the Robert
Morris and Lehigh games, making for three
competitive games that students can see in
person. ’ _ -

As Winn shows in his article, Dixon has
mastered the art of “scheduleball.”

“‘Inscheduling, the NCAA is gonna look at
RPI. So I care about RPI,”’ Dixon is quoted as
saying in the Sports Illustrated article. A

One more quality Southeastern Confer-
ence opponent should’ve come to Pittsburgh
as part of the Big East—SEC Challenge since

‘Pitt travelledto Tennessee in 2011. But Pitt

was excluded from the competition this year

and didn’t receive notice of this untiljune 1. By
that time it was difficult to ﬁnd a replacement.
game of similar caliber, according to athletic
director Steve Pederson.

“We were led to believe we had a home
game all along. At no point were we told that
we wouldn’t get a home game. They’ve put us
in a difficult spot,” Pederson said to ESPN in a
June 1 article. “We went on the road last year,
and there was a clear assumption that if we
went on the road that we would get a return.”

As such, the cumulative record of Pitt’s
nonconference home opponents last season
was 161-165, including the City Game at Con-
sol Energy Center against Duquesne, which
is technically a neutral site. But fans still have
the ability to watch the game in person,— it’s
a home game.

Pitt faces Fordham and the winner of the
Lehigh—Rob ert Morris gameas part of the Na-
tional Invitational Tournament season tipoff. If

. they win these games, the Panthers will prob—
ably play Michigan, Virginia or Kansas State in
New York City over Thanksgiving break. These
three are likely NCAAetournament teams, ac-
cording to ESPN’s bracketologistjoe Lunardi.

Watching the team play quality opposition
on TV will do nothing but make people yearn
for the start of conference play, especially with
this year being the last time Pitt will compete
in the Big East and considering the talented
teams — Syracuse, Notre Dame and Marquette
included — coming to campus in‘ 2013.

Let the wait begin. I ’

' Still, with the second half of the sea-
son beginning Monday night against the
Kansas City Chiefs, the Steelers know they
still have room to improve. And that’s the
best thing about this Steelers team — it
never stops getting better.

The resolve Pittsburgh demonstrated
in last game’s performance couldbe a
jumping off point for the rest of the sea-
son, as Redman acknowledged Sunday
after running for 147 yards.

“This [result] shows we have a lot of
heart. When you play for the Steelers, it’s
all about heart,” Redman said. I ’

In Pitt’s two previous matches, the con-
tests went to all five sets with the Panthers
winning one and losing one.‘ In Tuesday’s
victory over Robert Morris, Wignot be-
lieved that mental toughness was the dif-
ference that marked the team’s dominating

. performance.

“Every point is important, especially
down the stretch, and we were able to finish
strong,” Wignot said. '

The Panthers will return to action at
the Fitzgerald Field House Friday, Nov. 9,
as they host Big East opponent Seton Hall
in their ﬁnal home match of the season. I
