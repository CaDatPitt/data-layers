Part of a column written for this space
11 months ago was not printed; an editor,
despite the :author’s objections, ruled a
phrase unﬁt for publication; ” The
column’s topic was October’s series of
assaults, at Lothrop Hall, , and the
offending clause that sought to describe

' the perverted prowler was: “the guy_who

climbed from under a particularly slimy
rock...” -

The eventsof the past 11 months have

information leads one to the incredible
conclusion-—a dormitory-prowling rapist
or murderer need not crawl from under a
rock. Much more confortable accommo-
dations, in fact, can be (and, in at least
one case, were) found in a dorm room.

An example recently discovered
despite an apparent ' cover-up: Police

girlfriend (and the girlfriend's roommate)

- in an eighth-ﬂoor Tower B room from late

October until shortly after Jones’ body
was found Jan. 4 in the Towers’
basement. « _ _

Though Pitt ofﬁcials will do little except
plead ignorance, enough information has
been gathered to permit the observation

that those responsible for Pitt’s dormitory’

security either are withholding informa-
tion or are incompetent.

Neither conclusion offers the Pitt dorm
resident much reason to hold conﬁdence
in Pitt’s current ability to protect its
on-campus students. In fact, it appears
anyone who relies on his resident
assistant or the residence life ofﬁce in any
manner at any time is crazy. '

problems such as that of Brinkley to their
RA. Residents of- the affected ﬂoor told
their . resident 7; assistant of Brinkley’s
improper (and illegal) presence. That RA
was supposed to forward the complaints,
but JoAnn Woodson, director of the
residence life ofﬁce, says she cannot
remember any such report.— _ '

i This is incredible, especially when one
learns that resident assistant currently is
assigned to another Tower B ﬂoor.

The problem does not appear to stem
from the system, though the RA works for
a residence life ofﬁce that works for a

concern been channelled correctly toward

The ever-popular liberal arts
major of the 1960’s is no longer the
most popular, as proven by the

H surge of enrollment in career-

oriented’ majors within the past
decade.

“Students today are more
interested in majors _ that will
prepare them for a specific
career,” said Dean Irwin Schulman
of the College of Arts and Sciences.

“Basically, the argument is not
one of money, but people do need
to be assured that they won’t
starve,” Schulman added.

In 1969, the most popular majors
among freshmen and sophomores
at Pitt were psychology, biology
and English Literature. ’

Hill’s at Girls High School in
Philadelphia.

Hill left school late last January,‘

to live with Brinkley in the
Overbrook section of Philadelphia.

Campus police refuse to com-.

campus police chief Curt Graham,
the investigation is being handled
totally by the city homicide
division.

Stiff Fine h
For Quad

Parking

The Department of Univer-
sity Parking issued a warning
yesterday that illegal parking
in the Schenley Quadrangle
will result in a $25 fine effective
immediately. 

Jan Thomas, spokesman for
the department, ‘said: “The
parking situation has become
extremely hazardous in the
Schenley Quadrangle. Fire
trucks ‘and other emergency
vehicles cannot respond pro-'
perly to emergencies in the
Quadrangle because’ of illegal
parkers.”

Any owners of vehicles
parked on yellow lines in
handicapped spaces without a
handicapped person's plate, in
ambulance zones, or on the
sidewalks will be subject to
ﬁnes at all‘ times, including
evenings and weekends.-

Last fall, the number of students
enrolled as psychology majors was

only one-half of that in 1969, only.

15 persons were majoring in
English literature, and no student
declared biology as a major.
Although the interest in English
literature has dropped considerably
within the past 10 years, there-has
been a notable increase in the
number of students majoring in
English writing, particularly journ-
alism. .
There has also been a growth in
speech majors, more specifically
communications, and the computer

-_ science majors have gone from zero

in 1969 to one of the most popular
majors today.

“Any ﬁeld pertaining to media
seems to be very popular today,

conferences will be held in the
ballroom - and ground ﬂoor of
Schenley Hall.

On Monday morning there will
be workshops on how to write a

resume and interview for a_

careers in -law, there will be a
workshop on Tuesday, with another
workshop dealing with civil service

careers to be held immediately

stated. . c

There has been a remarkable
increase in all of the pre-profes-
sional fields, such as engineering,
medicine and social work, with the
exception of education which has
had an enrollment decrease of
about 50 percent since 1969.

Schulman doesn’t believe there
is any right or wrong direction to
take when selecting a college
major. \ l

“In the short run, the career-
oriented major may benefit the
student more. But in the long run,

afterwards.

On Thursday, different

' approaches to utilizing a liberal

arts education (entitled “Is there
life after a liberal arts degree?),
and workshops dealing with intern-
ships and self-designed majors will

Raise for Bureaucrats

By The Associated Press

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The
House yesterday defeated forthe
third time a bill that could have
given members of Congress and
high-level bureaucrats a seven
percent cost-of-living pay raise.

The bill would have raised

 current congressional salaries of
' . $57,500 by $4,025 a year.

~ The vote came after a complicat-

“ ed series of parliamentary steps

designed to head off another
victory by opponents of the pay
raise.

The first step in the process
came when Rep. Harold ~L.

' Volkmer, D-M0,, who at one time

Wednesday voted to pass the pay
proposal but changed his vote to
“no” when the bill was going down
to defeat, formally asked the House

'to reconsider the rejection.

Volkmer’s last-minute ‘vote
change Wednesday put himon the
winning side and allowed him to
offer the motion to reconsider. The
House then agreed on a roll call
vote of 214-193 to reconsider the

' pay ‘defeat. .

But opponents also demanded a
roll call vote on the issue of

, approving the pay raise bill and 47

members, three more than needed,
rose in support of that request.

And on the roll call vote—ballot-
ing that puts each member _on
‘record as supporting or opposing
the pay raise and the legislation to
which it was attached—the vote
was 212-196 to kill the measure.

Volkmer again originally cast his

vote in favor of the bill but changed

it at the last minute to record
himself as opposed.

‘Although the House defeated the
bill, again it‘ did not move’ to
prohibit any further reconsidera-
tion. That means the bill remains
technically alive. However, it was
considered unlikely that pay
supporters would try again to get
the seven percent pay hike
through.‘

Today’s reconsideration was
allowed because opponents of the
pay increase did not prohibit
reconsideration after the House
had voted 214-196 Wednesday to
kill the measure.

That oversight kept the bill
technically alive on the House ﬂoor
and allowed it to be brought up
again.

It was the third time’ in three
months that the House has voted
on the question of raising its own

pay. .

city—will try to catch a glimpse of
the pope. V

The city’s hospitals are making
elaborate plans to cope with the 50
percent increase in heart attacks
and other medical emergencies
that are expected when the pope
celebrates mass on Boston Com-
mon.

“We expect to see extremes of
several kinds—the very old, the
very young and, most of all, those
who are already sick,” said Russell
Kulp, head of emergency services
for the city Department of
Health and Hospitals.

“A lot of ill people will make the
effort to see the pope in the hope it
will help them by receiving special
blessings,” Kulp said.

On an ordinary day, emergency
rooms at Boston hospitals handle
1,350 cases. But on Oct. 1, they are
expecting 2,000. 4

To cope, the city will station 29
ambulances at the Common, along
the pope’s parade route and
elsewhere around the city. Boston
City Hospital will set up four
medical ﬁeld ‘stations on the
Common capable of handling
serious emergencies, and the Red
Cross will -run 12 first aid stations.

Island

Study Goes On

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG—State Health
Secretary Gordon MacLeod today
asked the Legislature for $515,000
to continue health studies on the
Three Mile Island nuclear accident.

MacLeod told ' a special House
committee that the accident’s
effect on the health of hundreds of
thousands of residents “has been
virtually ignored.” ' ‘

“We read of engineering studies
...and studies on the economic
impacts of TMI,” he said.

‘ ‘But just because we didn’t have

people in hospitals with radiation

sickness, there are those who tend
to write off TMI as an unfortunate
accident from a health stand-
point.” ‘

MacLeod said that his depart-
ment already has received $421,000
for research from the federal
government and the Electric Power
Research Institute.

Without the research, MacLeod
said, “the” inevitable result will be
that in some subsequent accident,
public officials again will be
required to respond virtually by
intuition.” »

By The Associated Press
MEDIA, Pa. —The Rev.
Bernard Pagano, who had been
accused of being northern Dela-
ware’s “Gentleman Bandit,” will
not be prosecuted for the at-

tempted armed robbery of a
Pennsylvania dress shop, Dela-
ware County. District Attorney

Frank Hazel said yesterday.
The announcement means that

all prosecutions against the 53-‘

year-old Roman Catholic priest
have been dropped.

Ronald Clouser, 39, of Brook-
haven, who pleaded guilty to three
of the Delaware robberies commit-

 

ted earlier this year by a

0 m_ild-mannered, well-dressed ban-

dit, will be charged in the dress
shop incident, Hazel said at a
morning press conference.

“We don’t think there is an open
and shut case, but we are not here
to determine whether Father
Pagano is either guity or inno-
cent,” Hazel said. I

“We must determine whether
there is enough evidence to
prosecute. It is still not open and
shut because two of the witnesses
still maintain it was Father Pagano
who attempted to rob them on the
evening of Feb. 22.”

   

 

The assailant left empty-handed

0 after the owner of the Glen Mills

shop, who identified Pagano at a
preliminary hearing, told him she
had no money.

Hazel said his office will seek the
dismissal of charges Monday,
when the trial was to start.
Forty-eight persons from Dela-
ware, Maryland, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania were interviewed in
the investigation. Several. were
given lie detector tests, Hazel said.

“This office has determined not
to prosecute because the possibili-
ties are problematical at best,”
Hazel said.

H?-‘-.\E;!_ 

Clouser, an industrial engineer
for the U.S. Postal Service who said
he committed the robberies’ to
continue his custody battle for his
three children, came forward
during Pagano’s trial for five
armed robberies and one attempt-
ed robbery in Wilmington, Del.,
Aug. 20.

Charges against Pagano in
Delaware were dropped after
Clouser admitted committing three
of the Delaware robberies under a
plea-bargaining arrangement.

Clouser, who has admitted his
involvement in the dress shop
incident, passed a lie detector test

Communications
     Failure in
Residence Life‘ i

 

',F. 

 

 

The facts speak for themselves. Some residents of
the eighth floor of Tower B have said that Sidney
Brinkley, a suspect in the killing of Monica Renee
Jones, lived on that floor with his girlfriend Estelle
Hill,~from October 1978 until mid-January 1979,
perhaps in violation of residence hall regulations.
The comments by the students, who wished to remain
anonymous, illustrate how sever the situation was.

The residents said Brinkley charged long-distance
phone calls to residents’ phones without their
knowledge, made obscene comments to women in the
halls and often walked into eighth floor
bathroom when it was being used by women. Accor-
ding to the residents, at least one-quarter of the
women on the eighth floor were upset about the
situation.

Despite the dissatisfaction of the floor’s residents,
it seems it took an intolerably long time for the Of-
fice of Residence Lifeto solve the problem. The
women complained to their resident assistant, but the
complaint reportedly went no further than that.
Woodson says she has no memory of any complaint
being received by her office. In this case, the com-

munications lapse appears to be the fault of the.

resident assistant or her immediate superior, the area
coordinator for. Tower B.‘ But, since ,the resident
assistant refuses to discuss the incident and the area
coordinator has left the job, it is too early to judge
who “may have failed to enforce the residence hall
rules prohibiting guest from staying in the dor-

mitories for more than five consecutive days.

A more serious problem seems to be the attitude of
the bureaucrats who are investigating any possible
rules violations by Brinkley. During an interview
with Conney Kimbo, the vice chancellor for student
affairs, Gary Houston, the vice chancellor’s
executive assistant and Woodson, the three were un-
willing to admit if Brinkley had broken the rules, and
questioned the published statements of the residents
of the eighth floor. _

Kimbo said he is willing to talk to any student who
will come to him about this matter, and that Wood-
son and he will meet with the student Affairs Com-
mittee of the Board of Trustees to discuss how to
revise dormitory regulations to end problems like the
two month stay of Brinkley in Tower B. One im-

..mediate answer would be to require resid.ent—_.assis-

tants. to report guests who live with students for more
than five days, even if they remain within the letter of.
the regulation by vacating their host’s room every
five days, as eighth floor residents have said Brinkley
did. '

If the Office of Student Affairs is going to give a
full airing to this problem, it first must admit there
was a serious snafu within the organization of the
Office of Residence Life when it failed to eject

Brinkley from the dormitories sooner than it did. V

Once this is conceded, the student affairs office can
deal ‘fully with the problem and take all steps
necessary to correct it, including personnel changes if

7 they are needed. _ h

though George Harrison, Ringo

Five years—-think of it:
Rolling Stones have remained
intact for over 15 years in the public
eye, and while there is no doubt
they can rock better than almost
anyone, they do not merit exalted
status as a creative force. The
Who, whose rock opera “Quadro-
phenia” is one of the most
prominent works of music compos-
ed in this century and likely the
crowning achievement of rock, is
not esteemed so highly. _

Once the The Beatles broke up,
of course, a search began to name
the logical successor: Badfmger,
the pre-disco BeeGees, Bad Com-
pany, 10cc, and the list goes on and
no one fit in just right.

Knack, detractors will tell you,
does a blatant imitation of The Fab
Four. Admirers hail them as the
second coming."

What I will say is that The
Knack’s sound" has an almost
uncanny resemblence to that of the
early Beatles. - The Knack does the
same riffs, the same simplictic
lyrics with the same catchy
refrains. It’s been done before, by
almost every British band that
broke the charts soon after The
Beatles paved the way, from the
early Who (check “The Kids Are
All Right," in which Roger Daltry’s
vocals sound as sweet as McCar-
tney’s) through lesser groups that
faded into oblivion. .

As for The Knack, it may well be
the long awaited successor. but the

 Fraternities Exploit Women

A couple of. years ago, Ian Dury
and the Blockheads released a song
called “Sex and Drugs and
Rock’n’Roll."’ Many people
considered it decadent, but it
describes the outlook many college
students are forced into taking.
Because classes are generally a
drag, and mostpeople take them

only to reach a higher goal--a

degree that means little for a job
that could mean less—students are
alienated from everything,‘ includ-
ing their leisure time. What we do
for entertainment often reﬂects just
how degrading our lives . as
students are. ‘ ’

In the personals of The Pitt News
Sept. 19, I saw one fraternity was
featuring a female exotic dancer
and another was featuring - stag

- ﬁlms for the Friday-night bash. .

Here we have, on our campus at a

liberal arts college, -student organi-
zations supporting and extending
the degradation and exploitation of
women and sexuality in general.
For their leisure, these frats get
into treating human beings, as
objects and playtoys. For
entertainment, they exploit wo-
men.

A find this ‘a bit disgusting but,
even more so, perfectly under-
standable in a place where people
are led to prove how much they
have learned by doing speed for
three days in a row to cram for a

test that will be forgotten _ 20 »

minutes after its completion. It is
perfectlyunderstandable in a place
where education is judged more by
an ability to acquire the skills to
“get over” than an interest in
learning something new. When
your future holds a choice between

working for something that treats
you like a number or becoming the

something that treats everybody A

like a number, it is not surprising
that you could turn to great things

' like skin ﬂicks for fun.

Perhaps-SGB should do some-
thing, like cutting the frats’
budgets and giving the money to
something a little more construc-
tive. But that would solve nothing.
It just should be realized that this
campus is the center of the highest
degrees of double-standards and
hypocrisy. Education and de-
gradation are antithetical, in
theory. At Pitt, they not only go
together, they are co-stars in a

Pitt'hasn’t won a match since its
opening night defeat of Brigham

Young University-Hawaii campus. .

Following their win, Pitt. lost. to
BYU and then moved on to lost two
straight matches to Hawaii-Hilo, a
division II school. The scores ofthe

ﬁrst match were 15-3, 16-14, 15-6, .

while the second night’s scoring
was 15-11, 15-5, 15-1.

“Hi1o was just outstanding,”
said head coach Mike Hebert.
“We knew that they were strong
but not that strong.” ‘

He added that although Hilo is a
Dvision Ilvschool, they play several
Division 11 schools and were
runners-up nationally last «season.

“Hilo had an amazing backcourt
defense,” said Hebert. “With our
slow, deliberate type of play, we
just couldn’t keep up with them.”

“We are getting ‘better as a
'team,” said Hebert. - “Besides a
couple of small letdowns, we are
playing the best’ volleyball we have
every played as a_ Pitt team.”

-After the Hilo match, Pitt faced

the current number one team in the _

country; the University of Hawaii.
The Pantherettes lost to A the
Rainbows 15-5, 15-5, 15-8 the first
night _and 15-6, 15-4, 15-8 the
second night. \ .  A‘

The Pantherette spikers are 1-5 against three Hawaii teams while on their recent west coast tour. They" are (currently

competing in the San Diego Invitational.

Their blocking was fantastic.”

In last year’s nationals, Pitt
faced Hawaii and were pounded b
scores of 15-0 and 15-1. ’

“Although we were ‘out there
getting our rear ends kicked, I feel
we were playing the best volleyball
we ever have,” said Hebert.
“Just look at the difference
between last year’s and this year’s
scores. The improvement shows

up there.’ ’

The Pantherettes-I are on a
rigorous schedule and have played
every night of their trip, so far.

According to the coach, the

“The level of

.5. To make a long story short, Durosko comes up to

me and says, “Hey Stackpole, would you look at

“ V9-iris?” and he hands me a copy of ‘ an article that is

‘appearing in October’s issue of Penthouse magazine

’ - , entitled, “The Penthouse 20 Worst College Football

Teams of I979-80”. After hurriedly looking through
Lihe pages, I glanced up at-him and said, “Where are

‘ : the pictures?”

5'21: 1!. j: 1

..-- wstood names such as Army, West Virginia, Boston -

..'..—.:u"-.'aa..» . -zjrr

“No, you dumbell. Don't look for the pictures.
Look at the teams that made the list. We play five of
the 20 worst college footballteams in the country!”

Sure enough, in between the usual rummies of

. college football like Northwestern, Idaho, Rice and

Tulane (a team that we have thrashed in the past)

College, Kansas, and Syracuse. (West Virginia was
rated 10th, Army 12th, Boston College, Kansas, and
Syracuse 14th through 16th, respectively).

“But wait a minute Jeff,” I said. “Arent we sup-
posed to be a possible contender this year? You
know, like New Orleans or Miami-style contenders?”

C (Yup. 9 I , ,

“But don’t we only play 1 1 games?”

c ‘Yup. 33 V /,

“I think I’d better read this.”

“Good idea, Harry.”-

So, I picked up the article (and looked through it
for pictures one more time, just to make sure that I
didn’t miss anything) and read. It was a decent ar-
ticle. The fellow that wrote it, Lawrence Linderman,
is a really clever guy with a sense of humor (which is

A -something that you don’t find in a sportswriter too

often). Some of the stuff he says about some of the-

teams that made the list would make for some great
one-liners by a stand-up comic. For instance:

, On Northwestern (picked as the number one worst
college football team in the country for this season.
Congratulations.)—"-N,orthwester.n’st -major
problems are offense and defense, in both of which
they are deficient. ”

University of Texas at El Paso (ranked third):
“UTEP’s gridiron speciality is the equal opportunity
defens’e, which allows opponents to score five touch-
downs a gamqwithout regard to race, creed, color or
talent.”  E _ " . ‘ . ‘ 

Illinois (ranked thirteenth. This one is my
favorite.): “What do you get for a coach who still
thinks that the forward pass is some kind of flash-in-
the-pan gimmick to be avoided at all costs? Why,
you get him a -job as a head coach in the Big Ten,
which helps explain why Gary Moellar is running the‘
antiquatedshow at Illinois. It also fully explains why
Illinois bores its fans ‘to tears.” ‘

Then he gets to the five teams that we are playing
from the list this year: _ '

West Virginia: “John Denver notwithstanding,
almost‘ heaven is not West Virginia. However it is
almost heaven to play West Virginia, a losing foot-
ball team indeed.”

Army: “-...the Black Knights of the Hudson have
turned into the Sweethearts of Sigma Chi.” .

Boston College: “Hollywood producers could do
worse than to study Boston College’s 1978 football
season for possible adaption as a-movie comedy.”

Kansas (a 24-0 victim of ours last Saturday): “Af-
ter several losing seasons, the Jayhawks hit bottom‘

. .anyway? _ ‘

last year when they finished with a 1-10 mark and ac-
tually lost to Kansas State, ‘which is roughly
equivalent to the New York Mets being routed by _

those Taiwanese kids who always win the Little "
» League World Series.” ‘

' Syracuse: -“...you wind up with the distinct im-7'

pression that this year the Orange will beppmostly  1

black and blue.” .
What does it all mean? Well, if this guy has his a H

together, and I think that he does (he's been doing

this for Penthouse for a few years) it means that there 

' are some real stinkadora football teams out there this 3.
» year, and that Pitt is" going to have ‘the privilege

destroying five of them (well, four since we already 9. 5
beat Kansas). And before any of you Penn State fans 
say anything, (did I just swear?) just remember that 

_the Nittany Lions (what is a Nittany Lion anyway?)
play Army, West'Virginia and Syracuse on three con-

‘ secutive weekends in October. Outside‘ of us, Texas’
’A&M, and Nebraska, and pussycats from State V, a
College don’t have that tough of a schedule this year“

either. P .

To sum it all up, the only thing that the Panthers'._1,-- . I
should really have to worry about (outside of t»h'e',j ..  . ‘
miracle that some of these teams might beatus, ‘
which isn’t entirely out of the question) is that they

don’t run up the score enough against these guys, and
the games against Washington and Penn State. _. 
And remember, before anybody says anything ’

about the Pitt Panthers playingtoo easy of ai.

schedule to be considered as a contender, just _
remember some of the lean years when we probably

would have given Northwestern a run for the money. ._.

When Pitt takes the ﬁeld at

.K_enan Stadium against North

Carolina tomorrow, they will
employ the same starting team on
offense that blew out'Kansas last
week. '

The lone exception will be on

‘defense, where either Bill Neill or

Jim Covert will start in place of
Dave Bucklew, last Saturday's

‘ first-teamer.

"Carolina fans are excited about
the current season after the Tar
Heels relatively easy 28-0 whipping

'-of South Carolina two weeks ago.

The Heels have had a week off to

_ mend their wounds, and coach Dick

Crum is anxious for tomorrow’s
kickoff.

“We had a few minor bumps and
bruises, but nothing, serious,”
Crum said recently. “We should
be in pretty good shape.”

‘ Which means Crum’s crew will
be out to unleash its newly installed
I-formation offense on the Pan-

thers’ strong, aggressive defense.

against South Carolina, and is the
main man in Chapel Hill.
North Carolina used the veer last
season, but junked it half way into
the’ year, and now employs an
offense similar to Pitt’s. “I think
our personnel here was better
suited to the l,” Crum explained.”
“We felt that it would be a good
offense for us.”
Blocking for Lawrence, quarter-
back Matt Kuupec and fullback
Doug Paschal is an impressive
‘offensive line. The three keys to
Carolina's line play are center Rick
Donnalley (Jr. 6-2, 241), tackle
Steve Junkman (Sr. 6-3, 234) and
guard Ron Wooten (Jr. 6-4, 254).
Safety man Ricky Barden (Sr.
5'9, 178), is a an All-America
candidate, and according to Pitt
coach Jackie Sherrill, the secon-
dary is probably the most improved
aspect of the Tar Heels’ game.

the linebacker position. Buddy
Curry (Sr. 6-2, 221), has been their

, The Pitt offense is in good shape
for tomorrow’s game, although
Russell Carter may miss the game
with an injury. Rick Trocano, after
an impressive first game, should
have a tougher test tomorrow. Dan
Marino should see action, and
Sherrillwill use him if he believes
the situation dictates such action.

Randy ‘McMillan is recovered-

from knee sprain, and will try to
duplicate his 141-yard performance

PHILADELPHIA(AP) — Could
Joe Paterno be losing his fervor for
college football? Recently, Paterno
actually described coaching major
college football as a pain in the
butt.

The Penn State coach was visibly
upset with the increasing difﬁculty
in keeping .some players academic-
ally eligible. Also there were some
attitudes of this generation that
perturbed Paterno.

,4. He observed before the opener

with Rutgers last Saturday that one
alumnus was‘ annoyed that a star
defensive back flunked out.
“How could you let that
happen?” the alumnus asked,  .
“Because I took the exams for
him,” Paterno said he replied

Paterno is busy getting his
sixth-ranked team ready for Satur-

winless, but good, football team.

Paterno repeatedly has boasted
that Penn State produces Top 10
football teams with student-
athletes. He insists that 95 percent
of his players graduate, some with
hojnjors. He emotes pride in that
he’s building character as well as
winners. 7

But in recent seasons Penn State
has recruited some players who
might not be able to keep up
academically, just as other major
college football powers have.
Paterno has also turned down
some, who have appeared ' on

I Grove City Deals Pitt Booters Third Straight

isy ANNA ARLOTTA

Pitt News Staff Writer
Losing games by a 1-0 S00“?

' appears to be the fashionable thing
to do this season. At least it seems

‘that way for the Pitt soccer team-
The
straight 1-0 contest when Bethany
College beat them Wednesday
night.‘

Panthers lost their third

No one involved with the team

,can actually put his finger on the
problem. Whatever the reason, the
Panthers have been unable to score

in their first three contests.

Without goals the Panthers have no
where to go. They can no longer
rely solely on the defense to stop
the ball from going in the net.
Holding the opposition to only one
goal per game has been impres-
. sive.
considers the sort of tough
competition that the defense has
‘been up against.

Especially when one

The Panthers went into the game
with enough conﬁdence _to win.
Scoring goals is something Pitt
must do if it is going to salvage

anything‘ from the 1979 season.

If the Panthers can put together
a scoring combination, the season
can still be successful. The chance
comes tonight when they face ‘

 
   

 

Slippery Rock. The Rock defeated
the Panthers last year, 2-1, on a
goal with only one minute
remaining.

Wednesday night’s goal came in
the first overtime period after the
two teams battled to a 0-0
regulation tie. Bethany’s Dave
Tomer was able to catch a rebound
shot and score to put Bethany on
the board after over- 90 minutes of
playing time.

Slippery Rock, like Pitt, a loser to
Grove City, comes into tonight’s
game with last season’s high
scorer, Jeff Buirge, (brother of
Panther wing Jerry Buirge) who
scored 10 goals last year. Also
Gerry Hendershot and Ed Molina
should prove to be scoring threats
to the Panther defense. Hender-
shot led Slippery Rock two years
ago with 18 goals.

Whoever the opponent, the
Panthers must find a way to score
goals.‘ V A

“We must ﬁnd how to score
goals this season if we are going to
be successful,” said coach Leo
Bemis. “We must do something to
open that magic door.”

Game time for tonight’s contest
is 7 p.m. Students should enter
Gate 10.
