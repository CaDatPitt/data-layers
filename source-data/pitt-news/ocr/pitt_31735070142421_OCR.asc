People older than 50 can take" classes and go to events as members of Pitt’s Osher learning program

Even though he retired from his job as .
a teacher, 73-year-old Michael Feld-
man is stepping back into the class-
room‘-— this time, as a student.
Feldman is a member of Pitt’s Os-
her Lifelong Leaminglnstitute, a divi-
sion of the College of General Studies

which allows people -50 or older to
take courses through the University.
The program offers classes such
as Wine in Australia, Homicide In-
vestigation and.BirdinginPittsburgh.
Members may take as many classes
as they wish, space providing — and
they can also participate in social

events offere'd by the Institute.

. Like other Pitt students, Osher
members have photo IDs. They can

use campus shuttles, borrow books
atHillmanLibraryand go to PittArts
events.

The Institute also hosts a “Fall

_Fling” each year to kickoff the new

term, as well as lecture luncheons,
tours oflocal attractions and trips for
members. -
Members of the program can

audit two undergraduate classes per
term with an annual membership of

$225 or a single term membership
of $125. Each additional class audit
costs $25. '

Associate members can audit
classes for $55, but they can’t take
Osher classes and don’t receive cer-
tain Pitt beneﬁts.

Judi Bobenage, director of the Os-
her program, said that Pitt is one of
few universities that allows members
to audit classes. She said that this op-

Pitt upsets UConn 67-57

Adam Littman
Asst. Sports Editor

All Nasir Robinson needed was
one shot. '
With the Pitt men’s basketball
team trailing No. 15 Connecticut
49-48, Robinson drove from the
left corner and leapt under the
basket, tucked the ball close to his
chest and then laid it in for his only
two points of the night.
lRobinson’s only basket gave
the No. 20 Panthers a 50-49 lead
they wouldn’t relinquish en route

. to‘ a 67-57 win at Connecticut last

night. The win improves Pitt to
14-2 overall and 4-0 in the Big East,

‘ ‘ joining No. 4-Villanova as the only A
_ undefeated team left in conference
play. .

Leading up to Robinson’s trip
underneath the hoop, the Hus-
kies (11—5, 2-3) erased a 10-point
second-half lead by the Panthers.
A 12-3 run by Connecticut cut the
lead to 46-45 with 10:05 to go

‘ in the game. After Connecticut’s
Kemba Walker missed a shot,‘

Gavin Edwards pulled down the
offensive board and kicked it out to

Jerome Dyson. The Big East player .
of the year candidate drove into the‘

lane, spun and connected on a lay-
up to give the Huskies a 47-46 lead
with about nine and a half minutes
remaining. It was the Huskies first

virus immediately.

The second is more of an anti-
rectal—viral drug. It is to be applied
daily, building up a concentration of
the drug to prevent viral replication

"if the person is exposed to the virus

during rectal contact.

McGowan is specializing in the»
second type of microbicide, which is ‘

the more long-term one.

Research in this ﬁeld has been ex-
ecuted over the last 15 years — about
as long as anti—HIV measures have
been taken—buthasfocused only on
developing vaginalmicrobicides for
womento use. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has not yet approved
the vaginal microbicides.

The  microbicide cannot
be used in the rectum, McGowan

explained, because the rectum is a ;

less studied and more delicate area
with a one—cell lining compared to
the vagina’s 20- to 30-cell lining. He
pointed out that many people look

to treat the HIV virus once they have

already acquired it.

“We need to develop techniques or
approaches for prevention,” McGow-
an said. “Peoplebeganwith condoms,
butyou can’t always use condoms and
particularly in the developing world,
women just don’t have the ability to
negotiate condom use.”

McGowan said thatusingthis mi-
crobicide, women in_ for ex-

ample, can make the choice to ﬁght

c

HIV without having to explain what
they’re doing.
“Microbicides can empower

. women with a product they choose

to use,” he said. _
Several Pittsuidents agree.
“This is a great stepping stone
for women,” freshman Neal
Burkard said. “I feelthatthese women
should havefree accessto [the micro-

_ bicides] once it is fully developed.”

An  hope for the anti—HIV
gel was that in addition to prevent-_
ing HIV, it would ﬁght other sexually
transmitted diseases. Early versions
of the microbicides were ﬁrst tested

on animals, whose results looked as I

County to benefit from
new table game revenue

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Witharoll ofthediceoraturnofacard, Pennsyl—
vanians will help local libraries.

Last week, Gov. Ed Rendell signed Senate Bill
711 into law, making table games — poker, rou-
lette, blackjack and other forms of gambling —
legal in Pennsylvania, and some of the proceeds
will go to the Allegheny County Library System.

The legislation comes some months after a
protracted budget battle between Republicans.
and Democrats in the state legislature. Many
Republicans fought for spending cuts, while
many Democrats fought to keep spending atthe
status quo despite less revenue in the national
recession. _

The law passed partially as a way to gener-
ate more revenue for the state. Revenue from
table gamingwill initiallybetaxed atarate of14
percent. The rate will drop to 12 percent after
this year.

Under the legislation, around 2 percent of
the gambling revenue will be put back into the
communities that host them.

One percent will go to the Allegheny County
Library System. The other 1 percent will go to
Allegheny County itself, State Sen. Wayne Fon-
tana, who serves Pittsburgh and its surrounding

‘Jr

communities, said. ’

The legislation could provideas muchas $250
million dollars inrevenue forthe state, according
to the Post—Gazette.

Forprevious legislationpassedon slots, which
the state considers separate from table games, 2
percent of the revenue went to the county. T

But table game licenses will be issued to busi-
nesses for a price.

Stand-alone and race track casinos will pay
$16.5 million for a license, while resort casinos
will pay $7.5 million.

Rivers Casino, the only casino in Pittsburgh,‘

plans to purchase a license for table games from
the state. Community relations director George
Matta said the casino hopes to have games up and
rtmninginfour to six months.

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Boardstill

has to determine the regulations that govern table _

games. Untilthathappens, Mattasaid, the casinos
won’t be able to open the table games.

The casino plans to hire and train at least
300 new employees to staff those table games,
he said.

He said the addition of table games will bring

- people to Pittsburgh.

“We now have the same entertainment op-
portunity as Las Vegas or Atlantic City. We’re a
full casino,” Matta said.

N o grades in Osher classes

Auditing studentscan receive grades with special permission

Osher 4 

tion depends on whether the program is offered
at a state—supported university and if the state
itselfhas set regulations that allow adults over
a certain age to take classes.

There are no grades in the Osher classes, ”

but depending on the class, instructors might
ask the students to read or complete writing
assignments. Those who choose to audit under-
graduate classes do not receive grades either,

unless they request special permission from.

the professor.

“I love the auditing classes because on—the-
whole they are more challenging. When I audit
them, I do thework andtake the tests, so it keeps
me on my toes,” Feldman, aformer audiologist
who taught at California University of Pennsyl-
vania, said.

This spring, Feldman is enrolled in both
French and Italian through the Osher program.
He is also auditing Spanish Grammar and Com-
position and Bollywood and Indian Cinema,
not to mention the two classes he is taking at
Carnegie Mellon University.

The Osher program is geared toward adults

looking for intellectual stimulation rather than A

students who want to obtain a degree. There
are no academic requirements from an Osher

student in order to participate in the program.
“A lot oflearning in Osher is incidental learn-
ing  it’s osmosis. What you absorb, you absorb,

and what you don’t, you don’t. You don’t go home ,

and spend hours studying,” Feldman said.
The program receives supportﬁ'o'm the Ber-
nard Osher Foundation, which works to sustain

~ post-secondary scholarship programs and leam—

ing institutions for seasoned adults.

Susan Kinsey, the former dean of the College
of General Studies, startedthe program at Pittin
2005. It is currently one of 122 Osher institutes
located on campuses across the country.

After reachingamembership total of 500, the
Osher program at Pittwas awarded a $1 million
endowment. ‘

The courses are instructed by current Pittfac-
ulty, retiredfaculty or members of the Pittsburgh
community with expertise in a particular area.

The instructors submit proposals for the
courses they want to teach, which are designed
around an outline of requirements by the cur-
riculum committee of the Osher program.

Bobenage said that Osher programs at each
university haveﬂexibility when planningtheir
curricula. Adults youngerthanso canstillbecome

African film explores A
drawbacks of foreign aid

GSPIA.admimZstrator sponsors viewing of ﬁlm on campus B

Mollie Durkin
For The Pitt News

Iwen whenlaid to Africawas at its peak, poverty
rose on the continent, according to one Aﬁican
economist.

‘ So what are we doing there? Last night, Pitt
students came together to ﬁnd out.

Louis Picard, Director oflnternational Devel-
opment at the Graduate School ofPublic and In-
ternational Affairs, sponsored the viewing of the
ﬁlm“WhatAre We Doing Here?” on campus. The
ﬁlm explores the effects offoreign aid on African
countries —— and they don’t seem pretty. Overthe
last ﬁve decades, the charity given to Aﬁica has

 

from 11 to 66 percent during 1970 and 1998 -
even though aid ﬂowing to the continent was at
peak level duringthis time. ‘

But the ﬁlmmakers assert all charity is not
bad.

The men behind “WhatAre We DoingHere?”
are compiling a database of charities and busi-
nesses that offer new alternatives to eradicating
poverty.

Oxfam America, an affiliate of Oxfam Inter-
national, and Business Fights Poverty are two of
these organizations. dxfarrt is an international

«relief and development organization that aims at

saving lives and overcoming poverty, hunger and
injustice. The organization works to increase the

“This is a good opportunity to learn.”

dance, felt skeptical about foreign aid.

‘Now, it is much less formal’

Osher student compares older ways of learning language to his classes at Pitt

Osher < 4

and take Osher classes, however, the primary au-
dience of the program should be older adults.

“Most of the classes we offer are in liberal
arts topics so they are pretty academically-
oriented, but we do also want to provide some
other courses that arealittle bit more fun, alittle
bit lighter,” Bobenage said.

The Osher classes are ﬁve weeks long and
meet for two hours per week. Each fall, spring,
and summer term has two ﬁve—week sessions.

“We ask for course proposals that are more
narrowinscope becausewe ﬁnd that our mem-
bers like to delve into a subject deeper rather
than doing a survey course that touches on many
different things,” Bobenage explained.

At the end of last year, Pitt’s Osher institute
had 825 members. Bobenage said that duringa

given session, between 650 and 700 members

are enrolled in classes.

Bobenage said that there are more students
taking Osher classes than auditing undergradu-
ate classes because most members are more
comfortable learning with their peers.

This is not the case for Feldman.

He said he is very comfortable working with
students 50 years younger than him, especially
in his language classes.

“When I went to school a long time ago, we
never worked in groups — that was not the
way language was taught. Now it is much less
formal, and we can work in groups of two and
three,” Feldman said.

Feldman said he is used to being surrounded
by younger students since he started taking Ger~
man at the University in 2003.

When he is not taking classes, Feldman
spends his time traveling.

He just returned from a 10-week cruise to
Australia and New Zealand.

Once the next session of Osher classes be-
gins Feb. 1, Feldman’s schedule will consist of
about 13 hours of class per week in addition to
his audits.

West Point and then worked with
soldiers in the Army, according
to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

The Pirates face a routine
that Holliday says instills more
composure, concentration and
confidence in players. Holliday’s
esoteric training also seeks to
improve energy management
and even self—awareness and self-
regulation. Holliday will work
with minor-leaguers as well.
Even if the new hire has the Pi-
rates spending time on the couch
compared to the gym, after 17
straight losing seasons, it’s time
to start getting innovative.

It’s no secret. The Pirates abys-
mal performance has prompted
their status as the butt of baseball
league jokes team next to the es-

teemed Pittsburgh Penguins and

Steelers. Sure, they have the dis-
tinction of being one of the teams
to play in the first ever World
Series, but it’s been a dark era
lately. Holliday knows baseball
can be a tough game on a player’s
psyche. “Baseball is a game de-
signed to make you fail, and peo-
ple play this game even though it
makes you look foolish. That, to
me, is what mental toughness is

all about,” Holliday said to the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Last year, the Pirates’ players’
salary figures added up to a total
of $25,197,000. Bobby Crosby
— their highest paid player ——
received a salary of$5,30o,o00,
according to ESPN. Somehow we
don’t think Holliday costs that
much to have around, so let’s
give him the chance to step up
to bat.

Perhaps Holliday’s role as a
sports psychologist reﬂects on

. a greater theme: We care more

about our athletes beyond their
almost showbiz—like role as ath-
letic entertainers. At the end of
last year, the NFL asked willing
current and former NFL players
to donate their brains — upon
death, of course — in order to
research head trauma and brain
damage potentially improving
safety standards in the NFL.
Steroids in the MLB were made
illegal in 2005‘ not only because
of their unfair edge, but also be-
cause of the detrimental health
effects they have on users. Hol-
liday is there to help the Pirates
win, but he’ll have to deal with
players perhaps demoralized by
their losses.

Mental skills coaches aren’t
unheard of. The Boston Red
Sox, Cleveland Indians and Tex-
as Rangers have mental-skills
coaches, and the Pirates recently
had a mental-skills coach, Geoff
Miller, before Holliday. We don’t
expect Holliday’s technique to
accomplish miracles, but we’ll
take anything that can help re-
surface the shipwrecked team.

In defense of the Shopaholic

Why shoppers hold unwavering fidelity to favorite stores

 
  
 

Katie Azzara
Columnist

Since 2009 has recently come to
a close, I would like to share some-
thingthat happenedthisyearwithyou,
something that ﬁlled a lifelong void
within me. Itwas the sumrnerof2o09
when I ﬁrst heard of this strange and
wonderﬁil happeningatmy local mall:
the opening of a Forever 21 store.

This might not seem like such a
monumental event, but to me, it was
truly great news. If you are a female
between the ages of 10 and 30, perhaps
there is no need for me to detail the
appeal of a store like Forever21. Butfor
all of the clueless men out there, let me

just say that you will be hard-pressed
to ﬁnd a girl who doesn’t like to shop
at Forever 21.

Sure, most people don’t obsess
about it the way I do, but shopping
there is always an exciting experience.
This store is full of clothing and acces-
sories that seem copied straightfrom
the runways and the pages of fashion

magazines. And if this blatant imita-
tion sounds like a bad thing to you,
rememberthatForever 21 is probably

the closest that most of us will get -to =

emulatingthe styles created byfamous
designers. I suppose I shouldbe slightly
embarrassedby my obsessionwiththe
store, since most girls probably went

teenager, and Forever 21 aims its ap-
peal at teens and tweens, I‘ never had
the opportunityto shop there growing
up. My local mall was sadly devoid of

one. Idid, however, hear stories of its -
greatness from -faraway places, and I

had a_ handful of opportunities to ac-
tually visit the store. Yet the lack of a

during my second year of college. -

Students, take a step back and take a walk

it’s timely and lessconvenient, but walking will reduce your carbon footprint, save you money and provide exercise

 
  

Hay Thuppal
Columnist

Ithinklbeganto realize howmuchl

cided to take a Port Authoritybus four
blocks ﬁom myhousetothe Cathedral.
A quick ﬂash of your Pitt ID and it’s a
convenient Port:Authority ride foryou.
In reality it’s quite a shame, especially
since the streets and ample sidewalks
around Oakland provide plenty of op-
portunity for walking.

With our fast—paced, party—all-
weekend, study-all-week,,sleep-‘til-
ﬁve-minutes~before-class lifestyles,
walking everywhere hardly seems an
option.'I‘his isn’tjustthewinterweath—
er talking. We have this mentality all
year round. . l

‘ Unfortunately, we might be over—
looking one of the easiest waysto stay
ir1 shape and save money. In the last
few years, Americans’ waistlines have
grownwhile high gasprices have made
our pockets shrink.

Will starting to walk more often

eliminate obesity and drastically re-
duce our dependence on foreign oil?
Probably not. Butit’s a step in the right
direction.

One only needs to look at the story
ofjohn Francis to see that while walk-
ing can be inconvenient, it is far from
impossible. In the ’70s, Francis wit-
nessed an oil spill inthe San Francisco
Bay andunderstood the detriments of a
life revolving around petroleum.

Following this incident, Francis

‘decided to divorce himself from oil
by forgoing any mode of motorized
transport. Atﬁrst, such atask seemed
impossible. His friends told  that
theywouldjoinhim, butonly afterthey
had enough time and money.

A true rebel, Francis, who wrote a
bookabouthislife, wasn’twillingtodis—
miss  new idea because of ﬁnancial
constraintis. He went ahead with his
walkingprojectbut quicklyfound that
not everyone was enthusiastic about
it. Without a car, Francis was unable
to hold a steady job and found thathjs
personal relationships also suffered.

Such sacriﬁceis rather impractical,
but Francis’ trials do shed reason on

why we are so reluctant to walk.

I I hailfrom Mt. Lebanon, Pa., — a

communities. We’re after the spacious
houses with two-car garages and big,
green front lawns. That's why neigh-
borhoods that are setup like Mt. Leb-

the roads. ’

Intruth, the idea ofwalkabletowns
isn’t without merit. Since 2006, the
German suburb of Vauban has been
boastingstreetswithoutcarsand hous-

es without garages. Seventy percent of
thetown’s residents don’tovvnacarand

nearly 60 percent of them sold their I

that only allow residential develop-

ment. Vauban is different, and it has_

, commercial districts within walking

distance of almost every home. The

on the outskirts of the development
and are used for longer road trips.
Inspite of such possibilities, Ameri-
cans are quite attached to their cars.
Automobiles have madelbirthdays of
16 years abig deal and havinga set of
wheels in your garage is a sign of in-
dependence. ‘ .
Inspite of all that glamour, co_nside

that motor vehicles contribute nearly
one quarter of annual carbon dioxide

when we are claiming environmental

Sex toys and solitaire:‘Contradictions’

Artist Adam Welch provides ‘A Few Objects — Thoughts on the Theme of Contradiction’ in new exhibit

Jordan Streussnig
Staff Writer

A Few Objects -— On a Theme of
Contradiction

709 Penn Gallery

Jan. 8-Feb. 19

Wed. and Thurs.: 11 a.m.-_6 p.m. _
Fri. and Sat.: 11 a.m.-8 p.m.
Sun.: 11 a.m.-5 p.m. I

Sometimes art is meant to sim-

ply look beautiful, to brieﬂy catch *

our eyes as we hurry by — a minute
distraction from the million things
on our daily agendas.

Other times, however, art is
meant to make us stop and think
about the world in which we live,
and about where exactly we ﬁt
within it.

' It can also provoke discussion
about purple sex toys and games
of computer solitaire.

Pittsburgh artist Adam Welch
asks us to delve beneath the surface
and tap into deeper thought with
his current exhibit, “A Few Objects
—— On a Theme of Contradiction,”
which is on display until Feb. 19 at
the 709 Penn Gallery Downtown.

The pieces constituting Welch’s

current body of work “make play of

theoretical information and implic-
it contradictions in the constructs
developed to better understand our
existence,” according to the exhibit
press release.

“The common thread that ﬁxes
my actions, thoughts, being to
something of function may simply
be contradiction — most things I
do, say, think are sort of lost in 
opposites continually playing out
internally and in reciprocation with

,_ my environment,” Welch said.

Sonja Sweterlitsch, the recently
appointed curator of the 709 Penn
Gallery, said that Welch is “inter-

. ested invexposing the contradic-

tions within -and between theories
that are developed as a way to
understandjour existence. These
contradictions  cause an unrav-
eling that makes‘ us wonder what
we really know about ourselves and
our being.”-" _ ’ '

A According to Sweterlitsch, art
on display includes “painting, draw-
ing, sculpture, found objects, move-
ment, sound and light,” all based
upon this theme of opposition.

A large panel, 150 inches by 80
inches, stands at an angle near the
entrance of the gallery, beckoning
passers—by inside to look and to
think. \

Titled “Of Individualization and
the Orgy,” this piece is swathed in
various shades of pink, and awhite
fabric blankets the panel’s perim-
eter, inducing a softening effect.

Appearing in various corners
and near the edge of the piece are
designs of blue, orange, gray and
peach that resemble cellular pat-
terns and molecular structures.

The pieVce’s«vibra-nt pink and soft

‘ edges ﬂirt with the notion of liv-

ing tissue, which makes the very
piece seem alive. The rigidity and
repetitive design of the added lines
seem to emulate matter at its tiniest
proportions. _

Almost quickly enough to cause
a sort of scale-shock, viewers are

then confronted with a work that
blasts us out of the miniscule and

. into something resembling the un-

known void above us.

“Finding Order” consists of a
projection screen with tiny punc-
ture holes that reveal, if only in
specks, a back lighting element.
The screen is covered in splashes

of paint in various colors, and con-
necting the scattered little bursts of
light are rigid white lines, creating

geometric shapes reminiscent of
constellations.

- This piece calls to mind the
grandest scale of our existence, of
our universe.

accidently kicked it under my bed

‘Simpsons’ celebrated by documentary

Patrick Wagner
Staff Writer

“The Simpsons 20th Anniversary
Special: In 3-D! On Ice!”

Directed by: Morgan Spurlock
Starring: Morgan Spurlock, Matt
Groening

Fox Broadcasting Company
Grade: B+

In aworld rampantwith Tomacco
deaths, corrupt Quirnbys and more
Family Guy-Star Wars crimes than
you can shake a Smithers at, it’s nice
to know that every Sunday night the
most lovable of Springﬁe_ld’s bright
yellow families will be there to tickle
America’s funny bone. Afterzo years
of Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Santa’s Little
Helper, Marge and of course the no-
torious Homer, “The Simpsons”_ will
be celebrated this most monumental -
ofmﬂestones with an hour—long docu-
mentary examining every aspect of
“The Simpsons” phenomena.

Directed by Academy Award-
nominated documentary ﬁlmmaker
and lifelong Simpsons fan Morgan
Spurlock, this look at Springﬁeld’s
illustrious television history is more
than justa report on the negative con-

genital effects of the Krusty Burger.
In keeping with the tone of “The
Simpsons,” much of what interests
Spurlock is not what would be found
in an encyclopedia but instead the
show’s most popular quirks and its

‘ rabid fandom — a wise choice by a

director who knows how to engage
an audience while still conveying the
essential information. From’ Matt
Groening’s shorts on “The Tracey
Ullman Show” to Argentina’s bud-
ding — and legally pending —— Duff
beer market, there’s little here that
doesn’t entertain.

The sheer ‘size of this program is

. incredible and demonstrates the cul-

turalpower ofthe series fromwithin
its one hour time slot. Today, adult-
oriented animated comedies make
up a sizeable portion of America’s
most popular shows. With examples
as far—reaching as Trey Parker and
Matt Stone’s “South Park” and Seth
MacFarlane’s 800-pound animated
gorilla known as “Family Guy,” it’s
easy to see how “The Simpsons”
broke new ground on what prime-
time television could be. Indeed, all
of these creative forces exclaim its
inﬂuence for Spurlock’s lens.

Not merely a relic, the show

celebrates its 21st season with the
companion episode —-— entitled
“Once Upon a Time in Springﬁeld”
— a perfect example ofhow the show
can remain relevant and fresh, even
with characters that are more than
20 years old.

Anne Hathaway lends her voice
to a love interest named Penelope for
everyone’s favorite children’s televi-
sion entertainer: Krusty the Clown.
Despite the hyperbolic sweetness
of their love, nothing is overdone,
and with his Rabbi father in tow —
voiced marvelously byjackie Gleason
— Krusty’s humanity is once again
conﬁrmed.

Similarly, the parallel story in-
volving the power plant’s attempt to
cut costs by eliminating donuts lets
us laugh at absurdities in our most
beloved culture: embracing Gary
Larson, the healthcare debate and
those most delicious of evils known
as trans-fats. _

' Taken together, this hour-and-a-
halfof programming creates an image
of the most important cultural force
we’ve had forthe past 20 years, which
continues to deﬁne what’s ﬁmny. Al-
though the episodes aren’t instant
classics like “Last Exit to Springﬁeld,”

WE ARE DIOS

Buddyhead Records

Rocks Like: Grandaddy, early Beck
Grade: B-

Groundbreaking. Revolutionary. Inno-
vative. These are not words I would use to
describe WEARE DIOS, the newest release
from California-based band Dios. Does this
inake the album bad? Of course not.

Mostly famous for having songs like “You
Got Me All Wrong” being featured on that
mecca of so~cal1ed alternative bands, “The
0.C.” soundtrack, Dios’ style is mellow, ac-
cessible indie-rock and good for relaxing
pursuits such as reading or studying. 1

WE ARE DIOS is the third record from

Dios same as a ways

the band, and though this album is good
on its own, it becomes predictable when
placed next to their previous recordings.
With a neo—psychedelic sound reminiscent
of the later Beatles material or early ‘9os
Beck, WE ARE DIOS is trippy and strange
enough to be interesting, but not original
enough to be fresh.

The album starts off slow. The ﬁrst track,
at over ﬁve minutes, somehow manages to

' be both busy and bland.

The first half of the album has a more
electronic sound than usual for Dios. While
the music isn’t bad, it isn’t a good ﬁt for
the band. Things begin to look up halfway
through the album, however, when the band
switches gears and returns to its more cus-
tomary organic sound.

Not bad, but still pretty boring over all,
WEARE DIOS, lives up to its name, showcas—
ing exactly the kind of music the band has

Pitt fourth in league championship

Coach Debbie Yohman is conﬁdent in the team’s future with three returning seniors

Kelly Flanigan
Staﬁ Writer

It wasn’t quite the same as former
Pitt basketball star Sam Young
doing backﬂips on his recruiting
trip ﬁve years ago.

Rather, after the Pitt women’s
gymnastics team ﬁnished fourth

' in the East Atlantic Gymnastics

League championships, three
Panther gymnasts —— Alicia Ta-
lucci, Alix Croop, and Dani Bryan
—— competed in the NCAA North-
east Regional Championship. Ta-
lucci earned ninth place on the
beam and floor exercise, and
Croop took ﬁfth on the beam.
The experience and leader-
ship of ﬁve returning seniors,
coupled with Talucci, a standout

sophomore, and a talented roster

overall should equal success for
the Panther gymnastics team this
season.

Pitt began its unofﬁcial season
with a Blue Gold Intrasquad meet
on Dec. 11.

This marked the team’s first
chance to compete in front of a
crowd.

Head Coach Debbie Yohman
was pleased with her team’s
performance at the preliminary
competition.

“The bars were great for us. I
feel we nailed our routines,” she
said. “On the beam we struggled
a bit, and we held back on the
ﬂoor because of the injuries, but
we have some work to do there.

for us tonight. Like I said, I am

McGwire admits steroids, not cheating

Evan Burgos
Senior Staﬂ’ Writer

 

Mark McGwire spoke to the pub-
lic Monday. More speciﬁcally,
he spoke with Bob Costas on the
MLB Network and admitted to
something he probably should
have fessed up to long ago.
Though tried in the court of
public opinion since a fateful
day in 2005, when the former
first-baseman refused to an~
swer questions about the use of
performance-enhancing drugsat
a congressional hearing, it was

“ not until this week that McGwire

deﬁnitively told the world that he

used steroids and human growth
hormones on occasion from
1993 through 1998. In 1998, he

from the game three years later.
Throughout his long interview
with Costas, and through a writ-

Whether rational or otherwise, it
seemed clear that McGwire believed

what he said.

claimed the single-season home
run record, belting 70. He retired

ten statement released earlier.

that day, McGwire maintained

5 Mark McGwire confessed steroid use but insists it was not for the purposes of on—fLeld performance

that the sole reason he used the
drugs was to aid and expedite re-
covery time. He said thiswas due
to a myriad of injuries sustained
throughout the ’90s and that he
did not use the drugs to gain a
competitive edge.

“There’s not a pill or an injec—
tion that’s going to give me, going
to give any player, the hand—eye
coordination to hit a baseball,”
McGwire told Costas.

Costas, for his part, did well in
the interview. He asked pointed
and direct questions and did not
cut McGwire any slack. The key
was that Costas wasn’t buying all
that McGwire, who amassed 583
home runs in a 16-year career,

was selling.

-McGwire had tears in his eyes. 1

His voice cracked on multiple
occasions. At one juncture, the
interview took a brief commer-
cial intermission to allow the
disconsolate slugger to gather
himself.

Whether rational or other-
wise, it seemed clear that McG-
wire believed what he said. It
seems nonsensical to think that
steroids wouldn’t help you hit a
baseball, but the look in McG-
wire’s eyes and his demeanor

revealed that in his mind, this A

was truly the case.
Although he was professional,
Costas appeared to have contempt

Pitt will open its season with a tri—meet
against Kent State and rival West Virginia
this weekend.
‘ Additionally, this season’s schedule

features home meets against Ohio State;

Penn State; a four-way meet with Brock-
port, Rutgers, and Iowa State and another
four—way meet with Penn, George Wash-
ington, and Western Michigan.

“West Virginia and Penn State are al-
ways tough competitors for us,” Yohman
said. “And Ohio State’s program is on the
rise so we have some great teams coming
to Fitzgerald Field House this season.”

Off the mat, the team stands out for
their tremendous accomplishments in
the classroom.

Last year, six gymnasts were recog-
nized for having more than a 3.5 GPA. Of
them, Jennifer Liberato, Lisa Taylor, Krista
Rubini and Shannon McConnell will return

McGwire apologizes

Makes excuses in interview that are unacceptedsby fans

Burgos< 14

MCT Campus

‘ McGwire admitted Monday to occassionaly taking steroids for ﬁve years.

for that explanation. Here McGwire was, V

after years of baseball exile for the belief
that he used drugs, ﬁnally giving his side
of the story, and Costas wasn’t satisﬁed.
It seemed that in the mind of Costas,
and probably for droves of other talking
heads, journalists and sports people, McG—
wire was at least partially untruthful. By
and large, when it comes to matters of the
steroid era of baseball and the accused
athletes, all people want is honesty to ease
the slights they’ve sufffered. Despite this
romantic, feel-good view, it isn’t really
‘accurate, as Costas demonstrated. What
people really want is for athletes to tell,
them what they think — to agree with
them. It is never enough for an athlete to
admit dishonesty, shame and cheating. It
isn’t enough for the athlete to say what
he, deep down, feels about the matter that
most directly affects him and his family.
Something to know about athletes, es-
pecially professional ones, is that they tend
to have supreme confidence in themselves.

They have gone their entire existence. ex- ,

celling at what they do — at being the
best. So, rational or not, it is completely
plausible that McGwire,believes it when
he says he did not take steroids to gain
strength. Call it denial or call it ignorance,
but McGwire seemed genuine.

Costas, and others who have weighed in
on the subject this week, don’t appear to
feel that way. The majority of what McG-
wire said Monday has been taken as truth,
with only this one glaring hole. In contrast,
I think this viewpoint should be reconsid~
ered. People should take into account the
tremendous anxiety and pressure that goes
into such an admission.

They should recognize the mentality of
an athlete, especially of one like McGwire,
who, steroids or not, stands tied eighth
all-time on the career home run list. They
should focus on what Big Mac did say be-
cause, despite any minor gripes Costas and ’
the like may have,_today the world knows
a better, more honest McGwire.

give Connecticut a 49-48 lead.

Dyson, who ﬁnished with 14 points, hit

5 a shot to bring the Pitt lead back down to

one. On Pitt’s next possession, Gibbs con-
nected from beyond the arc, and the Hus-
kies never got within four points again.

' Gibbs tied with Wanamaker and Con-
necticut’s Stanley Robinson for a game-
high 19 points. Coming into the game,
Gibbs was third in the Big East making
2.4 3—pointers per game, but that average
will increase after the sophomore went

led all players hitting nine free throws on

_1o attempts, including going 6 of 6 in the ‘ -

keep Pitt ahead. The Panthers made 85
percent of their free throws compared to
46 percent by the Huskies.

Gilbert Brown scored 11 off the bench
for the Panthers. In his ﬁve games since
returning from an academic suspension,
Brown has scored at least 10 points in
three of them and the Panthers are 5-0.
