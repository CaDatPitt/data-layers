burden of the Pitt draftee.

Once the discussion was started
by Lester Brailey, assistant to the
dean of men, specific ideasvalong
this line came thick and fast. The
consensus was that Congress should
begin as soon as possible to spon-
sor a program among the campus
organizations of providing Pitt
servicemen with news of Pitt's
people and their activities.

Andy Schurman sugested that
the YMCA’s present plan to circu-
late a series of “round robin” news
letters among the men in the camps
and overseas was a workable and
inexpensive scheme.

Personal News Urged

It was also proposed that Con-
gress buy each serviceman a yearly
subscription to the Pitt News. Mr.
Brailey thought that more personal-
ized news would be better appreci-
ated, and urged that each campus
organization‘ supply its own men
with news of its doings.

President Howard Greenberger
then presented for Congress’ ap-
proval the position he proposes to
take when he appears before the
Executive Committee of the Univer-
sity Senate to discuss the stadium
drinking question. V

Drinking Ban Pursued

He said in view of the fact that
there is already an established Uni-
versity policy prohibiting drinking,
the problem is only one of imple-

WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1950

Although the record snowfall that gave Pitt students an ll-day Thanksgiving

vacation was all but gone when classes resumed lllond

a<y, it left in its wake an

avalanche of problems for student and administration lea ers to plow through. Ef-
forts to reschedule classes and events cancelled by the snow are being hampered
by the already crowded semester's-end calendar, so that some of last week's

snowed—under activities have been cancelled altogether.

IF Social Committee will recom-
men to the IF Council meeting to
night that the postponed "Greek
Ball" beheld Jan. 19.

The decision was reached at a
meeting yesterday afternoon at
‘which it was confirmed that the
William Penn Hotel Ballroom was
available on that date.

Originally set for Dec. 1 the
Ball turned out to be one of the
several campus snow storm casual-
ties.

Social Committee Chairman ]oe
Edmundson stated that-fraternity
men who purchased tickets for the
dance before the postponement
should “hold on to them.” They
will be exchanged for new ducats
by the individual fraternity repre-
sentative on the social committee.

According to Edmundson new
bands will probably have to be
selected for _the dance. Elliot
Lawrence headed the bands for the
Dec. 1 date. Backing him up was
Baron Elliott in the hotel's Urban
Room.

The dance will be without the
‘usual favors for the women. IF

set aside for them to wind up the

the Delta Tau Delta roof’ Ralph
Douglas overdid the job and took
a sliding leap, shovel and all,
along with the avalanche.

Fraternity men and women who
had been stranded in Oakland put
on. a number of impromptu parties
during the early ‘part of last week.

“Hot Chocolate Desperation” party
on Sunday evening.

To relieve snowbound boredom,
some few students studied, others
played cards. At a marathon game
lasting several days, Berny Berman
admits to having lost 72 dollars
playing pinochle. Others, less rash,
played their fill of canasta and

frozen shut. It took a while for her
to thaw out, but she was soon ready

The joys of the unexpected
"snow-man's holiday” last week
won’t be dimmed by the penalties
thereof.

The Board of Deans has deter-
mined that class time lost during
the big snow will not be made up
by extra school-going in the future.

Instead final
for the week of Jan. 26 to
Feb. I have been rescheduled.

Classes will continue on through
this period with exams to be held
during regular class time.

The announcement issued by the
Deans explains the change
thoroughly:

“The time lost by the necessary
cancellation of classes during the
week of November 27 will be made
up by a rescheduling of the final
Fall Semester examinations for
undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents. The University Deans have
approved the continuing of regular
day and evening classroom teach-

ing into the period designated inr

the University Calendar for final
examinations - Jan. 26 to Feb. 1 --
using the last session of each
class for the final test. or examina-
ion. For Saturday students, régular

' classes will be held on Saturday.

Jan. 27, and the final tests will be
given Saturday, Feb. 3. The deans
of the professional schools will
make separate arrangements for
their own students.”

The decision of the deans was in-
fluenced partly by the plight of the
Pittsburgh Post Office which had
previously signed up 1500 Pitt
students for holiday work.

Most of the 1500 were scheduled
for daylight work. If classes had
been extended into the normal
Christmas vacation the students
would have been unable to work

A Post Office official told
Charles M. Ebert, placement direc-
tor, that “it would be impossible
for us to handle the Christmas mail
if those students have to go to
school.”

Work is play.

Not, of course, for most people;
but it's no contradiction for the stu-

’ dents of group work in the Graduate
School of Social Work.

Work for them includes folk danc-
ing, ceramics, craft work,' the pro-
duction of skits and plays, and the
planing of games that most adults
have forgotten.

As part of their training, the 39
students spend a day each week
high above the ordinary classrooms
in the group work studio on the
thirty-second floor of the Cathedral.

Here they learn skills for use in
working with leisure time groups.

Varied Work Possible

The studio, a four-room workshop,
is equipped for training in almost
every possible group skill.

The record library, containing
about 125 albums of folk songs and
dances, music with nationality back-
grounds, and some classical selec-
tions, provides the basis for train-
ing in folk dancing and music.

The crafts include painting, chip
carving, block printing, and leather
and metal working.-

denominations. The courses offered
were “on a plan most approved and
practicable.”
Division of Labor

The five faculty members divided
the seven-year course into two parts:
the classical and the collegiate.
Classical students first studied
grammar, Greek, Latin, and English.
The following year they studied bio-
graphy, which included mythology,
Greek and Roman antiquities, and
the_Bible.

The new University was a place
where young men could achieve a
practicaleducation. Thiswas espec-

ially rare in colleges at that time,

where Latin, Greek, and philosophy
were still the main subjects taught.

It was in the collegiate depart-
ment that students got most of their

Abolish College Bias,’  
Education Group Says

35’ JACK MKRKOWTTZ

"The quota system cannot be justified on any grounds com-
patible with democratic principles.”

That is the thesis of the American Council on Education, a
zop organization of educators and administrators, now engaged in
negotiations with universities whose admission practices give

evidence of discrimination.

One of the Council's major pro-
rams aimed at cracking the quota
ystem is that "all discrimina-
dry questions should be eliminated
com application forms.”

The Council hopes to have uni-
ersities agree to the removal of
zuch questions as race, applicant's
thurch, and mother's maiden name

-- items demanded by the Pitt
School of Medicine as well as by
he great majority of other schools
ind universitie s.

Such questions are not neces-
sarily used for discriminatory pur-
ooses, itis admitted.

But according to Dr. Floyd W.
Reeves, chairman of the Council's
Committee on Discrimination, such
‘techniques "lend themselves to dis-
gizrirninatorry practices and appear

Fund Okay;
Rumors Wild

"There are no plans at present to
change the building program.”

This was the official word of the
niversity News Service which
countered rumors that several
buildings in the proposed $12,700,000
or program were to be eliminated or
changed. ‘
Most of the rumors were concerned
with the Student Center which is
supposed to be built on the present
Cathedral campus. Some stories
stated that it would be eliminated
completely, others that it was to be
moved off the Cathedral campus,
possibly to a site near the stadium.

Mrs. C.V. Starrett, University
editor, ‘stated that all the rumors
that had been circulating around
the campus were “without founda-
tion.”

“There have been no changes in
the building fund program,” she
went on to say.

"Naturally, there is a lack of
money,” she said. “The fund pro-
gram is far from complete and a
great deal of work is necessary to

reach the top. But University of-
ficials feel confident that the money
will be raised and until that time
no changes will be made in the
program.”

Work has not begun on Clapp Hall,
she concluded, because of "delays
in the completion of final blue-
prints.”

to serve no purpose other than that
of discriminating against youths
from certain minority groups.”

Almost Sure Evidence

The President's Commission on
Higher Education, reporting a few
years ago on discrimination in col-
leges, declared that ". . .the re-
quest for certain information on
application forms constitutes an all
but prima facie case that such infor-
mation is likely to be used for dis-

criminatory P\1fP° 5°“

Since many universities which
-ask potentially discriminatory ques-
tions protest that they do not- dis-
discriminate in admission of stu-
dents, the Council on Education
suggests that “colleges should
publish statements of the proce-

dures they follow in admitting
students.”
"In certain instances,” adds

the Council, "legislation is ap-
proved as an adjunct to other acti-
vities in the fight against discrimi-
natiori.”

These and other resolutions have
been the bases on which the Edu-
cation Council has, for the past
year, discussed with iindividuall
schools the elimination of objec-
tionable admission practices.

A Little Progress

Some progress has been reported,
a few schools having agreed ‘to af-
firm the Education Council's pro-
gram. _

The Council’s program was adopt-
ed at a conference it held last year
under the co-sponsorship of the
Anti-Defamation League, an agency
primarily concerned with investiga-
ting discrimination against minority
groups.

The ADL is a committee of B’nai
B’rith, a fraternal organization of
Jewish men.

Fellow bachelors, have you stumbled over the pile of - well, let’s
be gentlemen and call it nonsense that Cora "How to Get a Husband”
Carlyle is dishing out in the Pittsburgh Press?

The lady frankly calls us animals, and is blandly giving the girls

stupid creatures ca lled men.

Look hard for her “marriageable types” next time you go through
the halls. The majority of these come under headings like neurotics,

snobs, vain ‘athletes, hypochon-
driacs, etc. For capttlring one of
her types, the sophisticate who’
thrills the ladies by his manly en-
counters with the headwaiter, she
advises: "After the red cape has
been waved to attract his atten-
tion, this bull can be taken by the
horns and led to the altar. You can
be frank with this animal.”

Sfereofyped Nonsense
That’s not the only bull in Miss
Carlyle’s collection of stereotyped

nonsense. “First in approach-—
ability” is the man who "has
always understood that getting
married is the first step in be-

coming a pillar of society.” She
admits that this "Rotarian” type
may be dull, but consoles her
feminine readers by reminding them
that they’ll never go unfed or un-
clothed.

The lady's 'Rotarian’ and his
wife would almost certainly have a
head start on becoming pillars of’
society. The wife would be stone-

have taken Cora Carlyle’s advice
to heart? No, No, a quick survey

of the women's reactions showed,
not only that the majority of the
girls queried hadn't read the art-
icle, but that the post-perusal opi-
nions ranged from “silly” through
"worthless” to "}3ilge!”

once said about prosperity so might we say about war: it's just

around the corner.

For about the fourth or fifth time in the last five years we
are again face to face ‘with the prospect of a war. This time,
I however, it seems to be a little more serious.

The United Nations has failed to impress the Chinese com-
munists with its ability or determination to enforce its sanctions.
The commies seem to regard the Korean action. as an American
show. They are well aware of our reluctance to begin athird

world war.

Warnings that an atomic bomb may be dropped on Pittsburgh
no longer sound as shrill as they once did. What we once regarded
as war hysteria now becomes depressing truth. ‘So we would like
to urge that civil.‘ defense plans both on the campus and through-
out the nation be stepped up, or if these plans have already been
formulated, we would like to see them publicized. What would we
do if an atomic bomb were'dropped tomorrow?

We also feel that there should be some clarification of the
draft law as it affects students. Or again, if such rules have
been formulated, we’d like to see them publicized. As things
stand most students don’t know where they stand. And it’s hard
to concentrate on a philosophy lecture or an ancient history
assignment when you're 1-A or on a 48-hour reserve call.

A final question, more or less rhetorical, might be: Isn’t
it about time someone came up with some poop for the troops on
what they’re fighting this one for? ‘

which a kind reader of this column
brought in, Pitt gridders were not
as victory starved as they were
this year. The Panthers won their
29th straight game when they
trounced W 8: J, 34-0.

Coming up a few years, we find
that in 1936 plans for the construc-
tion of the present "controver-
sial” Commons Room were being
_completed.

Meanwhile, a flood was the
cause for the Pitt Players’ delay
in their production of "Cock
Robin.” The Play was scheduled
for March,/ but was finally pro-
duced in Oct. of that year.

[Letter to Ed]

Love  Teacher ByMYRON KOPELMAN

  

Ever the conscientious reporter,-
I took advantage of the recent
vacation to conduct a survey which
disclosed a shocking condition in
the field of highereducation.

Passing through several drug
stores and pool rooms where cult-
ured collegians are apt to dispose
of spare time, I made conversation
and found that there is not com-
plete and loving harmony between
students and faculty.

Many students indicated that
they were not going to phone pro-
tests to University officials over
the delay in convening classes. As
a matter of fact, they hinted darkly
that they were actually relieved at
not having to attend their daily
lectures.

Shocking, but true.

Face Facts 1

Facing the facts, we find that
classroom lectures are ‘something
less than fascinating. ,
Students would rather stay at home
and sleep in a warm bed than sleep

.in a classroom. In good weather

they would rather cut class than

.come and reap the.rewards for
which their fathers have paid.
Tush,tush.

Ask any professor and he will
tell you that the situation is deplor-
able, It could be at that.

Of course, I admit that 50 per

cent of the professors lecture like
a bedtime lullaby. And I concede
that they fuss and fidget and drone
and cough and crack their knuckles
while they dispense with their
stores of knowledge.

And I further concede that half
of them don’t know the least thing
about public speaking.

Here's the Point

But the point is that if you dumb-
kopfs out there really wanted to
learn, you would steel yourselves
and catch whatever enlightenment
they throw your way, not matter how
they throw it. -

Teachers are underpaid as it is,
so why should we insist that their
"lectures be interesting and intelli-
gible? ‘What do students want -
learning or entertainment?

I am against teachers being
forced to submit their deliveries to
a check before they are hired. I am
against the theory that oral instruc-
tion requires oral skills.l am solidly

behind the worst bores on the
faculty. - _
That which we get the hard way

inevitably turns out to be that which
we retain and treasure forever after.

According to the fellow next to
me, that’s what one of my teachers
said while I was sleeping.

Miss Lois Foight, in her Ex-
change column, states that the
"green slate” of the Commons
room makes the ladies’ feet hurt.
She quotes women’ who have acted
as hostesses for open house, re-
ceptions, etc. Could it be that the
reason these ladies’ feet hurt was
that they had to stand for long
periods of time? Any floor can be
uncomfortable if you have to"stand
on it continually. Check the stu-
dents who wander around the Com-
mons room to see if the floor hurts
their feet.

Admittedly, the Commons Room
wasn't built specifically for danc-
ing‘, but many a place has been
converted to a one—evening ball-
room by the addition of a few ne-
ce ssigies such as wax, decorations
and the like. Wanna dance??

cepting a bid for the Rose Bowl
(incidently, Pitt beat Washington
University) . . . . .

It seems as though a reverbera-
tion from 1936 has occured this
year. When Pitt received the Rose
Bowl bid, band members, students,
and members of different activities
joined forces in an all-out effort
to “send the Band to Pasadena,”
- the team made the trip, but the
band . . . . . A New York corres-
pondent stated that “you couldn't
bear the Pitt band.”

A few years later, in an effort to
preserve dignity and good manners,
University administrators put new
smoking regulations into effect.
These rules were supposed to be
an air-conditioning measure. In-

Suicide Grid Card Announced

Ten Games
Listed, Two

Newcomers
’ By MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

Having just completed a nine-
game suicide schedule, Football
Coach Len Casanova can spend

the winter pondering next year's
ten-game concoction of the same
medicine. _

The 1951 card, announced today
by Athletic Director Tom Hamilton,
is the first since '45 which has
more than nine games. In
the way of changes, Northwestern
has been dropped, but two up-and-
coming Big Ten clubs, Iowa and
-Indiana, have been added.

Half the games will be played on
the road, with trips to Miami Uni-
versity and Rice Institute of Dallas
being featured. The season will
open at home against Duke Univer-
sity on Sept. 29.

chief instructor since the time Hugh
began wrestling while in the fifth
grade at school. It was at Tulsa
Central, however, that Rex offi-
cially bccame his son’s coach.
This situation lasted until last
year when Rex gave up his Central
job to assume the new»role of
wrestling‘coach at Pitt.

A Third Peery
Hugh, a pre-dent student who
wrestles in the 123-pound class,
believes that his younger brother
Ed, currently a sophomore at Shaler
High, will be the chief wrestler in

, the Peery clan. Yet Hugh's record

while at Tulsa Central belies this
statement. He captured the state
that gives wrestling top position
on the sports calendar.

boys in the Artman household. He

 began playing basketball under the

tutelage of brother Bob when he
was in sixth grade at St. George,

Lose Twice

Dr. H.C. Carlson took his 1950-S1
edition of the Pitt basketball team
into Ohio over the weekend for the
opening contest of the season
against Kent State on Saturday,

and a game with the Akron Good-

years on Monday.

Pitt came off second best in
both games,‘ losing to Kent State,
51-46, and to Akron, 55-49. The
Panthers next play at Gettysburg
Saturday night.

Carlson has been using veterans
Mike Belich (5-7), George Hromanik
(5-11), _and Bob Yurko (6-2) in his
starting lineup, along with Sopho-
mores Mickey Zernich (6-3) and
Frank Christopher (6-4).

Backing up the first five are
Letterman John Kendrick (6-1),
Sophomores Don Virostek (6-4),
Chet Palesko (5-11), and Scotty
Phillips (6-0), and holdovers Art
Malmberg (6-2) and Floyd Holstein
(5-I1).

Last rites were said over the 1950
campaign Saturday, as the Panthers
bowed to their traditional rivals,
the Penn State Lions, in a 21-20
thriller.

The crowning blow of the disap-
pointing season fell, of course,
when the final gun found the Pan-
thers standing short by one point
after having hacked away an early
21-point deficit. Even more ironic
was the fact that the missing twenty-
first point was absent because
Tackle Nick Bolkovac, on his last
attempt of the year, failed a con-
version attempt for the first time
this season.

display of pass-catching, however,

i I  PITT NEWS" Wednesday, December 6, 1950 - Page 6

Are Made

Want to know how carefully and conscientiously the All-State,
» All-East, and All-American teams are selected?

Well, a fellow who writes for

few weeks ago that he was assign-
ed to cast his office’s votes for
the company’s All-East squad.

"What do I‘ know from tackles
and guards and centers in the
East?” muses
the scribe. “So
I get me a few
copies of those
September foot-
ball magazines
. which claim to
know in advance
just who is the
cream of the
crop, and I dig
up a few lineups
 from the files,
Bolkovac and I pick myself
an All-East team. Just as simple
as that.

“Half the guys I picked I never
heard of. The other half I remem-
bered- vaguely, probably from some
old publicity releases.”

Explains Why
This confession explains why
Tackle Nick Bolkovac, Guard
Mike Boldin, and End Nick DeRosa
were the three Panthers to make
honorable mention on the first
All-American team to hit the
newsstands -- that is, the United
Press team. These same three
players happened to get prominent
. mention in the pre-season football

mags. ‘
It is taking nothing away from
Messrs. Bolkovac, Boldin, and

DeRosa to infer that they were
chosen because of premature write-
,ups. For all I know, they may be
better than the players who were
given first-string All-American
ratings.

But the fact is that the “All”
teams are based on bunk. Frank
Carver, who handles Pitt’s foot-
ball publicity chores, puts no

fuses to plug the local heroes for

Congrats to Nick

Despite the fact that this depart-
ment frowns upon most post-season
honors, congratulations are in or-
der for Tackle Nick Bolkovac,
selected Pitt's outstanding gridder
by the Monday Morning Quarter-
backs.

Missing the all-important extra

Nick no less the

The above cartoon clinches the
case against the Pitt News yogis.
It establishes them undisputably
as the world's worst prognosticators.

Here's why:

Not only did the yogis complete
the worst crystal-gazing season on
record Saturday, but in addition
gummed up the art department by
previously ordering an illustration
depicting them as conquerors of the
football players, who took turns
acting as guest yogis each week.

Needless to say, they did not
conquer the gridders.

Final results showed a four-way
tie for first place! The grand aver-
age of the gridders - .660 -- Was
exactly equal to that of yogis Will
Doerge, Myron Kopelman, and Sam

_ Spatter.

Lagging in the rear with a .641
mark was Stan (I Picked Penn State)

for employees.

Her experience at the camp and
the knowledge gained in some cour-
ses in dietetics brought her to Pitt
in 1943 as an assistant to Manager
of the Army Cafeteria in the Cathed-
ral basement.

People often ask her how she
could leave teaching to go into food
work. Miss C1-amblet didn’t like to
get away from her teaching andgroup
work Wllfhv Girl Reserves. and church
groups, but she felt her work here
was a challenge.

"We had-to move the kitchen and

food service department in three
weeks time,” she recalled.
"On the day before we had to

serve breakfast to 2500 starving sol-
diers, workmen were still painting
tables. Then we had to wash and
dry all those trays and dishes by
hand!"

Actually, she says the food ser-
vice department was initiated for
the students who begged for hot food
in the Cathedral.

fact is very evident to food service
employees who sometimes walk

vision. And they've checked those
