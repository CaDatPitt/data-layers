To Teachers

Dr. John W. Oliver, head of the

will be guest speaker at the Clarion
State Teachers college conference
to be held next Saturday.

Titled “America’s Cultural Op-
portunity in the European Crisis,”
Dr. Oliver’s speech will follow the
westward trend of the cultures of
the ancient civilizations. The speak-
er blames the incessant warring
upon European soil as the cause for
this movement, maintaining that
these cultures will eventually cross
to America.

“I expect the United States to be-
come the cultural center of the
world within the next hundred
years,” he stated.

at a luncheon ceremony to be held
after the morning session of the
conference. Dr. Paul W. Cordier,

Basis of Dr. Weber’s protest
was the fact that the University is '
the sole property owner on one side
of Fifth avenue between Bigelow-‘
boulevard and Belleﬁeld avenue. in
Weber’s Argument

“I understand the practice of your
commission (Better Traffic com-.- -.
mission) is to consider the wishes,
of property owners in the establish- _
ment of rules provided the through
traﬁic is not handicapped,” Mr,
Weber said. '

He then pointed out to lVlcNeil‘
that there will be cars parked on
both sides of the street whether or
not there is a two-hour limit and ».
that through traffic will not be af-_,
fected any more with the unlimited
parking time than it will be with
the two-hour limit.

“The only regulation that would‘
facilitate through. traffic would be
one to prohibit all parking and I
feel sure that no one wishes to have ‘
you include such a rule in your reg-4-‘
ulations,” Weber said. I ‘ »=

Spring Is Here! It Is Not Here.’

Smith, Tippetts, Carlson, Perring State Their Cases

Spring, spring, beautiful spring: it just ain’t here,

says Chet Smith.

In reply to a critical letter from Chester L. Smith,
sports editor, the Pittsburgh Press, published in Wed-

1esday’s News concerning the ap-
proximate location of spring, state-
ments were obtained from the judges,
Dr.  C. Carlson, and Dr. S. Charles
J. Tippetts, dean of the School of
Business Administration, and from
Mary Lou Perring, editor of the Pitt
Panther.

Dr. Carlson, who had not read the
letter and who
would, was heard to remark:

“Smith is just another left hand-

claim kinship with the Monongahela
valley. And furthermore he .”

Editor’s Notes

Spring

Spring is here, or spring is not here, depending On
your point of view. If you’re technically minded, spring
arrived on the afternoon of March 20.
an eye on the weather, you’ll either agree with Chester
' Smith, Pittsburgh Press sports editor, or side with the
Carlson-Tippetts school of meteorology.

Todav’s chapter in the feud between these three great
natural scientists, reported on page one, concentrates
on the interpretations of the learned opinions which
they submitted last week in deciding. whether spring

had arrived.

The Carlson-Tippetts majority outvoted Mr. Smith,
and decided that Pittsburgh’s weather forecaster W. S.
Brotzman should be forced to wear a coonskin cap for
a d.ay in settlement of his bet with Panther editor Mary

Lou Perring on the arrival of spring.

Judge Chester Smith has backed up his dissenting
opinion with. vigorous action. This week he left Pitts-
burgh’s chilly atmosphere for a fishing trip off Cape
When he returns from his vacation, Mr.
Smith will be able to ﬂing into the teeth of the Carlson-
Tippetts combine some sage observations on the state of
the weather on the Atlantic seaboard.

View of a new motion picture, “Johnny Apollo.”

, Pittsburgh was represented by staff members of the

20th Century Fox, turned’ out a picture whichbegins

We suspect that the majority of the 30 eastern col-

Cambridge Contracts

Harvard university summer school are not binding in
the event that the United States should become involved

in the European war.

According to the director of the summer school,
the contracts “are merely formal letters,”
tain an escape clause providing for the “contingency
of the United States’ participation in the European war.”

, Harvard oﬁficials explained that the agreements were
made out last September, with the realization that a

‘_Green Is This Valley’

‘Weak Tea’ Describes Coal Town

By Kal Kalwary

To those who depreciate the sig-
nificance of a locality as compared
to the signiﬁcance of the men who
live in it, I give Cherry Valley. Lay-
ing at the foot of the “red-dog”
heaps, the town has long ago been
engulfed by the ravenous mines,
and the people have been united in
close cousinship with the blind
earth-creatures who may be heard
scurrying away from the clanging
pick. A casual aviator would prob-
ably take the whole settlement for
Anthracite Mine No. 5, and he
wouldn’t be far wrong.

Solid Black Mass

Old Peter Kortyna is characteris-
tic of the thousand-odd inh.ab'étants
of Cherry Valley. Old Peter isn’t
more than sixty-ﬁve, but his iden-
tity with the mine has blurred all
indications of his age. Seeing him
for the first time, you get the feel-
ing -that the green grass and bright
ﬂowers which were young Peter
"have been packed into a solid black
mass by hard work and trouble,
"and, later by just hard work, for
'trouble comes only to him who can
remember happier thl-ngs.. The
drawn seams of Peter’s face are
traced indelibly with coal. dust. His
"eyes are covered with the ﬁlm that
1.0-;>mes from years of labor under-
ground. He can't speak English
wrell. and when he does the talk
rover strays very far from the coal.
For what can Old Peter say about
the European war or Debussey or
even John L. Lewis, when the view
from his window is a, slag heap?
Bolshevil»: Condemnation

Old Peter and his family—seven,
counting Millie, the orphaned niece
_-5-live in’ a company house. It’s a
wonderful house, with three rooms
-.'and a cellar, and if it hasn’t been
«painted for ten years-~well, the coal
diist covers everything anyhow. Be-
cause they are in America, with its
high standards for workers, the
'Kortynas have an automobile, and
they have to walk to the mine only
when there’s no money for gasolint.
The car is enameled a Hollywood
tan, but Mary, the oldest daughter,
hasihad a cough of some sort for
two years, which she can’t afford
to go to a doctor about. .

p; The house has no electricity, no
utayter; but the kerosene lamps are
' bright and not very dangerous in
.the crowded rooms, and it’s the
M lopinitrn. of the valley people that the

the removal of the two-hour limit

that the Schenley Farms company

‘Drivel’ Columnist Describes His Impressions of the Country

to be such, and after switching off
one such program in disgust the
other day we got to thinking about
what America really means to us.

We go in for collecting little men-
tal pictures of this and that, so
America to us means a series of lit-

tle scenes run off like a movie.

We remember an aged Negro
reading a ten cent book on the life
of Joe Louis in a crowded street
car chuckling to himself, and com-
pletely oblivious of the amused
glances he was attracting. And an-
other Negro, shuffling up a dusty
road on a blazing hot day in Arkan-
sas, turning in at the little store be-
fore which we were seated and
carelessly drinking from the water
cooler marked “White,” instead of
the dipper and bucket for “Color-
ed.” The owner promptly aroused
from his slumber and said quie-tly
and venomously, “You black
. , if you ever do that again I’ll
kill you. Now get the hell out of
here.”

I Pitt Shooters
, ' Seek National
, Rifle Trophy

By Alex Zelenski

" Billed as one of the East’s strong-
est combinations, the University of
Pittsburgh Riﬂe team left this
morning for Washington, D. C.,
where it will take part in the an-
nual National Riﬂe Association
matches tomorrow.

Team matches will be staged to-
morrow morning and individual
competition will follow in the after-
noon.

The Panthers’ high rating is based
on their showing in the recent
ilearst Trophy competition. The
Riﬁers placed sixth among the na-
tion’s teams, and have since made
considerable headway in dual
matches.

During the season they won: 11
ahd lost 8 against the country’s top
target men.

Last year in the National compe-
tition at the capitol city Pitt placed
fourth. In 1938 they ﬁnished a
notch higher.

Tomorrow morning the team will
have Jimv Bates, Townsend, LaSpo-
da, Haywood, Wilson, and Stiffey
on the line. These men have been
the mainstays of the team through-
out the year.

‘Jim Bates will carry Pitt’s main
hopes in the afternoon’s individual
matches. Results of these matches
will help determine the All-Ameri-
can Riﬂe team.

Captain Mitchell, coach of the
squad, and Sergeant McDonald, as-
sistant coach, will accompany the
Pitt shooters.

Over 40 teams have entered the
competition at Washington. The
winning team will receive a region-
al cup.

Also tomorrow nearly 200 other
teams will be battling for regional
honor in several other national
meets. The Washington winner
will be favored to take the national
crown which is awarded to the top
team from all the entries in the
Saturday shoots.

Hi-Rocks Win

Bowling Honor

All—Campus bowling honors rest
today with the Hi-Rocks keglers
after their 2-1 win over the Sweep-
ers last Wednesday afternoon on
the Strand alleys. The consistent
high scores of Johnny Kretz, and
Pete Pecora’s sudden surge in the
ﬁnal game swung the championship
to the Rocks outﬁt.

With a score of 593, the ﬁrst game
was taken by the Hi—Rocks but
Dick Trimble of the Sweepers took
individual honors with 181. Trim-
ble’s score was topped three times
as the match went on, Kretz rolling
195 and 197, and Pecora 218.

The second game went to the
Sweepers, necessitating a third line
to decide the winner. The Hi-Rocks
amassed 695 markers to annex the
rubber game and the series.

Coincident with the selection of

coach comes the announcement that
Sam Parks will give free lessons to
faculty and students for two weeks
starting April 8.

Parks was professional at the
Summit in Uniontown and now oc-
cupies a similar position at South
Hills. He was captain of Pitt’s 1931
golf team. In 1933, his ﬁrst year of
professional play, he surprised golf
fans by copping the National Open
golf tournament at Oakmont.

Underwood is the new pro at the
Alcoma Country club, which will
be the site of all of Pitt’s home
matches this year.

This year’s varsity entry will be
a green crew, since graduation last
June removed several veterans.
Tony Kay and Bill Daddio, last
year’s stars, have left, along with
Homer McClintock, Chuck Mathias,
Bill Rielly, Ed Lawry, and Bill
(3-eyer. This leaves only Bob Sey-
bold and Norm Sam from last year’s
aggregation. « ,

Coldspots Win First Polar Crown;

Snowﬂakes Get Two All-Star Posts

By Vince Matera

By virtue of their decisive win
over the Penguins in Wednesday’s
championship game. the Coldspots
"become the ﬁrst champions in the
freshman Polar basketball league.

The game, which ended at 30-23,
"was close all the way but the Cold-
spots were going away at the ﬁnish.
The Penguins had been ahead at
the half, 11-10.

Spartz was the outstanding play-
er on the floor as he scored 12
points to tie with Dolﬁ of the Pen-
guins for scoring honors. Frazier
and Lewis also stood out for the
Penguins. Lewis scored ﬁve less
points than his average per game,
chalking up 10 while Frazier stood
out for his ﬂoor play. Alcorn and
Jameson played well for the Cold-
spots.

-Champs Left 0])‘
All-League Five

Although they lost out in the
playoffs, the Snowﬂakes took top
honors in the freshman Polar league
all-star team by placing two men,
' Captain Artman and Swacus, on the
ﬁrst? team.

Three teams Tdivided‘ the‘: other‘
i ﬁrst The Seafwlaced.

Captain Mast-en, the Defrosters
Captain Malarkey, and the Polar
Bears Captain Lohmeyer.

Tay Malarkey was easily one of
the classiest performers in the
league. His ability is quickly rec-
ognized, for when he was in the
lineup, the Defrosters won, and
when he wasn’t in, they lost. Ed
Masten played brilliant ball with
the last-plase seals. Artman showed
exceptional skill in sinking hook
shots from diﬁicult angles. In one
game he amassed 20 points, second
highest individual total all season.

Swacus has a tendency towards
roughness but is tops in floor play.
Paul Lohmeyer completes the team.
Paul’s height gives him a decided
advantage in under-the-basket
struggles.

The reserve team is made up of
Ed Spartz, Marsh Alcorn, Bill Fra-
zier, Red Silverman, and Clarence
Lewis. Spartz and Alcorn have
starred with the Coldspots all sea-
son. Bill Frazier’s passing set up
most of the shots for Lewis who
scored the highest single game total
of 22‘ ‘points. Silverman paced the
Polar Bears with his ﬂoor play.

The Freshman league, an inno-

,,vati,(_>:n__i,r:t_.__:“a,t'lil,e_t.ics  produced

an interesting struggle for the
championship but also showed the
University a new group of boys who

appear to be excellent prospects for
varsity play.

Baseball Nine
Engages Duke
In First Fray

By John Chaﬂo

Eighteen promising baseball can-
didates are expected to comprise the
Pitt traveling squad which will
leave Pittsburgh early Saturday
morning for Durham, N. C.

According to coach Ralph Mitter-
.l1ng, three catchers, ﬁve pitchers,
six inﬁelders, and four outﬁeld can-
didates will be carried by the squad
on its invasion of the Southland.

The baseball party will stop off
at Stanton Military academy Satur-
day aiternoon for a short practice
session and probably reach Durham
sometime Sunday afternoon. A com-
plete rest is scheduled for Sunday
prior to the Pitt-Duke gamethe fol-
lowing day.

Hartman to Start

Although no starting pitcher has
been selected, the persistent reports
are that either Johnson or footballer
Edgar Jones will handle the assign-
ment. Johnson was one of Mitter-
ling’s starters last season.

The two positions which probably
will be in doubt until gametime are
the catching and ﬁrst base jobs.
However, indications are that some
of the pressure will be relieved by
using catcher Guy Guadagnino at
the initial sack. In that instance
“Gabby” Hartman is expected to
manage the catching chores.

Al Holbrook, holdover from last
year’s team, will probably be at sec-
ond and Foliart at the tough third
base slot. As yet the shortstop po-
sition has not been decided.

Jones Helps

The roster as released by coach
Mitterling to make the trip South-
ward will be: George Hartman,
Frank Goodell, and Guy Guadagni-
no, catchers; Johnson, Jones, Trio-
lo, Haluska, and Geiger, pitchers;
Holbrook, Foliart, Hughes, Katz,
Drobnuski and Vaiksnor, inﬁelders;
Keiper, Bush, Goelz, and Bonelli,
outﬁelders.

Pitt will be aided in their games
scheduled for the Southern trip by
newcomers Jones and Bonelli, The
former was an outstanding hurler
on several sandlot teams the past
few seasons.

In addition to the game with the
Duke Blue Devils, the Panthers will
meet Wake Forest, the University
of Virgina, and the University of
Maryland. The squad will leave for
Pittsburgh immediately following

the Maryland game next Friday aft-
ernoon.

A general assembly for all
freshman Women has been plan-
ned for Monday, April 8 in 132
Cathedral at 1:30 o’clock.

Sponsored by Senior Court,

ing will also be presented, accord-
ing to Mary Gregg, C40, chief jus-
tice of the court.

Room with the ﬂags of the nations
represented in the nationality
rooms have been organized by the
ﬂag committee of WSGA under the
direction of Nadine Dean, Ed41.
Committee Resumes Work

Early in the year representa-
tives of various nationality com-
mittees were honored at a tea. A
ﬂag committee of University stu-
dents of different nationalities was
formed to .work with Nationality
Room committees to complete the
project.

According to Miss Dean, the pur-
pose of the project is “to further
the nationality room theme of in-
ternational friendship, _and at the
same time, decorate the walls of
the Commons Room.”

Nine foreign countries were
present at the tea, with 16 repre-
sentatives. Guests were Mrs. James
Salay and Mrs. Paul Sturman, of
the Czechoslovakian committee;
Mrs. L. A. Vassal and Mrs. Donald
G. Clark of the French committee;
Dr. Lotte Lohstoeter and Karl At-
water of the German committee;
Mrs. Peter Caloyer of the Greek
committee.

Joseph Urban, Hungarian commit-
tee; Mrs. Peter Pivaronas and Mrs.
S. Johnson, Lithuanian committee;
Mrs. S. V. Karpova, Russian com-
mittee; Mrs. Z. E. Hallow, Syria-
Lebanon committee, Mrs. K. Un-
kovich, Mrs. William McA1eer and
Mrs. Anna Pekich, Yugoslav com-
mittee.

Two changes have been made in
the list of nominations for offices
in WSGA, as reported last week,
announces Miss Gregg.

Betty Richards, Ed41, has been
forced to withdraw as a candidate
for the position of president of
WBGA because of illness, and Na-
dine Dean, C41, has been nominated

pointed to take the place of Miss
Dean in the Senior Court.
