F oreignStudents Establish , ,
Memorial Scholarship F uncl   _

By VIJAY JAIN

Foreign students at the University have established a Scholarship
Fund for International Scholars in honor of late President John F.

Kennedy. JFK-SF-ISO will have its headquarters at the University '

and Work under the sponsorship of the Office of Cultural and Edu-
cational Exchange headed by Dr. Shepherd L. Witman. '
The organization will be a non-proﬁt, ‘cultural, educational, stu-
dent organization exempt from taxes. It will‘ solicit eontributins from
foundations and individuals and- sponsor "programs of international
entertainment to obtain funds for operation and scholarships. Yb
.Charter members, 35 in number from 18 nations, are students
from the University, Carnegie Institute of Technology, Mt. Mercy
College, Chatham, Robert Morris, and Duquesne. They conceived the
idea shortly after visiting Washington, D. C.,’ in December tofpay

-homage to the late president at Arlington National Cemetery.

Wreath Money ‘Contributed

At that time a collectionwas taken to lay a‘ wreath at the grave-
side but since then the students have decided to contribute the amount
towards the JFK-SF-ISO in deference to the wishes of Mrs. Kennedy.

- OCEE assistant director David Hoppes explained that though
the organization will be affiliated ‘with-OCEE, it will merely act
as the organization’s treasurer and legal counsel. Otherwise
JFK-SF-ISO will be independent of any outside intervention
within the framework of its constitution which has been al-
ready set up and approved.-

’ ~ More Chapters Seen

The organizers are enthusiastic about the future of JFK—SF—ISO
and hope to establish other chapters in other parts of the country.
The constitution makes provision for /such a possible expansion_ in
due course of time. .

The organization will have non-student directors composed
of one city council member, an officer of OCEE, a member of
-the bar association, two members of the ..board of directors of
corporations, a radio-TVV public relations director and a press
public relations director. ’ -

An advisory council provided in the ‘constitution-will be com-
posed of representatives from the State Department,‘ International‘
Institute of Education, National Association of Foreign Students Ad-
visors, student aid directors, the presidents of the universities and
colleges, educators and cultural attaches.

Economist Ties Loose Ends Together At'Midday

Galbraith Defends Foreign Aid

Economist J.‘ Kenneth Galbraith offered a
spiritedand witty defense of the embattled ~ con-
cept of foreign aid at _the Wednesday Midday
Series lecture in the SU Ballroom.

In a speech that served mainly to tie loose
ends together rather than to offer anything new
concerning “The Politics of Privation,” Galbraith
reminded this nation that it'must not urge its

“We have no real hope of keeping the gap
between the rich and the poor nations from wid-
ening,” he continued. “But what we can give the
people of the poor nations is a sense of improve-

Conservative Critics

Galbraith called critics of the Johnson Ad-
ministration’s foreign aid program “the same
'conservatives who opposed steam navigation.”
Taking his remarks even further, the economist
said these critics were theltype of people that

To increase the eﬁectiveness of this na-‘
tion’s aid program, Galbraith proposed four
points: he advised first that this nation be
braced forlthe economic‘ conservatism of the
poor countries. He attributed this conservatism
to a feeling prevalent in those nations that the

grams is’"more weighty than the promise of gain.
His second point was that this nation must -

be aware of the difficulties faced by the poor

A for its work in higher educa-

 L tion in Ecuador by Donald
A the

_Daughters, head of
--Agency for International De-
- velopment operations in that
. country, when hevvisited here last
. Friday.
Daughters sa/id, “Pitt is making
the biggest contribution to higher
f education in Ecuador of any of
the Universities taking part
 in the program. Houston »and St.
. Louis Universities also have fac-
, ulty members serving in Ecuador.”
There are 11 University fac-
ulty members teaching at Cen-
tral University in Quito, the
capital of Ecuador. Daughters
said, “Pitt’s contribution is so
great because they are helping
in many ﬁelds. It’s not just one
. ﬁeld in which they are involved,
but many.” .
Dr. Alan C. Rankin, vice-chan-
_ cellor in charge of Student Affairs,
pointed out that there are Uni-
versity faculty members at Central
- in the ﬁelds of business admini-
stration, public administration,
basic sciences, engineering, social
sciences, and the humanities.

process; t h e r e f o r e, economic
growth is'painful — and slow,”
said Galbraith. “Economic aid is a
specialized substitute for these
hard—to-get internal savings.”

No Easy-going Spending‘

This nation must become aware
that “we cannot apply our easy-
going methods of spending to poor
“nations,” was Galbraith’s third
point. He concluded the four with a
warning that the U.S. must not
— waver in its belief of the necessity
 of foreign aid.‘

’ ‘The ‘tall, graying economist
called on his experience as the
U.S. Ambassador to India dur-
ing the Kennedy years in his
summary of the worth of the aid
program. “The U.S. has a posi-
tion of\ esteem among smaller
7 nations because of our foreign
aid. We're regarded as a com-
passionate, interested friend.
We're not felt to be aloof, un-
involved.” ‘

Galbraith expressed concern
over the population problem. Cit-
ing the need for immediate birth-
control action, he held that the
poor nations cannot afford to “wait
for the pill.” The problem, said
Galbraith, lies in that sexual rela-
. tions in some of these poor coun-,

tries is one of the few personal
means of expression. “Yet we must
ask these nations to use all avail-
able means to cut down the birth-
rate,” he said. *

The ambassador’s conclusion
was that our aid program “takes
patience, effort, and money — but
it won’t be as expensive as
failure.” ‘

Ecuadorian Visits University

DONALD DAUGHTERS, head of the Agency for International De-
velopment in Ecuador, visited the University last Friday and praised
Chancellor Litchﬁeld for the work in higher education which this
institution is accomplishing in South America.

Daughters added, “We’re de-
lighted with the way Chancellor
Litchﬁeld and Pitt have taken an
interest in the program. They’ve
shown Ecuadorians they are inter-_
ested by their frequent visits.”

Central was recently closed
down due to student demonstra-
tions but Daughters said; “The
University is expected to open
any day. In fact it may be open
now. _

The closing of Central has not
meant that the Pitt faculty mem-
bers have been idle. Dr. Rankin

pointed out that many University
men have taken on other duties
while the "school has been closed.
He said, “Professor Jerry Chang

has been working closely with the _

inistry of Construction in an ad-
visory capacity and Professor
Tobias Dunkleberger has been
helpful at Catholic University in
their chemistry department.”

Daughters concluded that pre-

sent plans do not call for any more
American Universities a id i n g
Ecuador, “rather a consolidation
of what we have there now.”
