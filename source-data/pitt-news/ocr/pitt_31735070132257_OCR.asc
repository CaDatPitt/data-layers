Appeal for station denied

CHRISTINE CLAUS
Staff Writer

While some of Pittsburgh’s police offi-
cers are left wondering whether or not they
will have jobs to go to every morning,
Pittsburgh’s city councilmen have been
working hard to restore some of the recent
losses to the police force.

Mayor Tom Murphy, along with most
of Pittsburgh’s city councilmen, recently
agreed upon the 2004 budget, hoping to
change the uncertainty facing city ofﬁcers.

Murphy decided not to veto the budget,
allowing it to be enacted by city council on
Dec. 31, 2003 and to become a law without
his signature. The Pittsburgh City Council

g has agreed to amend the budget to satisfy the

concerns of Murphy.

By putting 900 police back on the
streets after the police oﬂicer recall that
occurred last summer, the city council hopes
to maintain thesafety of Pittsburgh’s streets,
according to City Council President Gene
Ricciardi.

City Councilman Alan ‘Hertzberg. of ‘

District 2 has campaigned with the West End
Home Assurance Value in hopes of reopen-
ing the West End police station, located near
the West End Circle in Pittsburgh.

On Aug. 29, 2003, the fonner Zone 4
police station in the West End closed down
because of Pittsburgh’s recent budget cuts.

“It’s not just that station building, it’s the
backup of ofﬁcers where we are hurting —
for example, investigative work,” Hertzberg
said

The zone changes also affected
Oakland. Once included in the former Zone
& the Oakland area has been combined with
several parts of other former zones to form
the new Zone 4. The other parts of the new

Zone 4 came from the Hayes and Gates
Manor sections, which were left over when
the former Zone 3 and Zone 4 were com-
bined.

According to Hertzberg, when the
police get a call about rowdy kids on the
streetsomewhere, it has become less of a pri-
ority than it once was because of the dirnin—
ished police force. The call gets answered
“much more slowly, if at all,” he said.

Once the decision was made to close the
West End station, Hertzberg joined the West
End Home Assurance Value in appealing to
the commonwealﬂr court to get the station

Their appeal was deniedafter a mom-
ing—long hearing on Jan. 13.

“The administration has not worked
with me at all,” Hertzberg said. "They are
working on turning the [former West End]
station into a curfew and truancy center
[known as the Safety Zone .”

‘ The Safety Zone "for children

under the age of 17 who break curfew, is cur— '

renﬂy located Downtown on Grant Street.

I . The most signiﬁcant change that will
result from the 2004 budget is a 50 percent
increase on parking tax, effective February
1, 2004.Thepankingtaxincreasewillbe
elaborated upon at a later date.

“There has been great cooperation and
partnering between the Mayor and the coun-
cil, which has culminated in [Murphy’s]
decision not to veto the budget,” Ricciardi
said.

City Councilman Jim Motznik said,
according to a press. release from
Hertzberg’s office, “The unintended result of
city council’s budget process was the cutting
of essentialservices; with Mayor Murphy’s
involvement ‘during the last Week, this new
amended budget will restore those services.”

Group surprises with kindness

RAK, page 1

The organization, is unusual among
non—proﬁt groups, in that it accepts no dona-
tions or membership dues. _ _

“We are funded by one anonymous
individual, and he would prefer that people
use their money for kindness in their own
areas,” Gates said. ’

Gates said that the foundation is grow-

« ing exponentially. She said that membership

has doubled every year since its founding,

_ and now there are more than 28,000 sub-

scribers on the foundation’s e-mail list
It should be noted that this movement

 not occurred in only the United States.
The Random Acts of Kindness Foundation -

became a founding member of the World
Kindness Movement at the MoVernent’s
ﬁrst meeting in Tokyo in 1996. Today, the
Movement has afﬁliates in 13 countries.
Despite being part of a global phenom-
enon, Pitt’s Random Acts of Kindness group
ﬁnds that the trends obscurity here often

causes people to doubt them. '
Last Halloween, the‘ group “reverse
trick-or—treated” in the Litchﬁeld Towers.

Members, dressed in costume, knocked on

doors and attempted to give away candy.

“People were Very, very hesitant of tak-
ing candy from us,” Vice President Emily
Reedsaid. “They thought we were doing it
for some ‘weird reason, not to be nice and
give them candy.”

“First, they thought it cost money, so we
had to tell them it was free,” Reed explained.
“But still they were wary about it”

Christilaw and ‘Davis think students

hesitated because RAK is a new group and
‘ students are not yet used to their presence.‘ , ‘
“I don’t think [students] expect it,”

Davis said. “I know I have never had anyone
come up to me and say, ‘Here, have a 101-
lipop, just because.’”

The group should be easy to spot ——
ﬂiey plan to begin wearing T-shirts baring
the words “Nice RAK” during group activi-
ties this semester.

A new Supreme Court could affect abortion, speakers warn

‘No, that’s not what right to privacy means,’ it’s gone,”
Horowitz said.

She also encouraged the 12 women and one man in the
audience to vote, seek oﬂice and become or remain politi-
cally active.

Florida, there will be other left-wing troublemakers,” she
told the audience.

‘These are our rights, folks. Fetuses don’t have rights;
we have rights, and we need to stand up and demand ﬂiem,”
Horowitz said.

“Abortion in this country is not about children. It’s
about women and who controls them,” she said later in the

_ evening.

Horowitz also described her
views on the diﬂerences between
sides of the abortion issue. A

“Listen to the rhetoric,” she -said.
“We have right on our side, but we
do not have the best [press relations]
—— [our opponents] do.”

Describing the label “ life”
as inaccurate, Horowitz described
her opponents as “anti—choice.” She
described her position as “not pro-
abortion,” but “pro-choice.”

Each member on the panel
spoke from a diﬁerent position in
the abortion process, and each

members of the conservative, anti-
abortion side of the abortion issue
were present.
“Our main goal is education;
we’re not looking to change peo-
ple’s min ,” said Jen Stephan, the
president of CW 0. “I think it’s real-
ly important right now that young
women, especially on campus, sup-
port pro-choice.”

addressed a different issue. No .

“For the panel, we really wanted to just get the reality
of Pennsylvania,” Stephan added.

Amy Benson, the minors’ rights coordinator for the
Pittsburgh chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union,
spoke about the abortion rights of a person younger than 18
years.

“Title 10-funded clinics are required to provide this ser-
vice to minors, even if they know their parents do not
agree,” Benson said

According to the laws in Pennsylvania, anyone
younger than 18 must be legally “emancipated,” gain the
consent of at least one parent, or go through a judicial
process to -get permission tothave an abortion, Benson said

Nicole Yelich, the Western Pemrsylvania Field Director
for the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League of Pennsylvania, added that a minor ﬁling for legal
permission is “always approved” She can go to court after

' having an ultrasound to ﬁnd out how developed. the fetus is,

and once she has received her court papers, the minor can
go to a clinic for an abortion, Yelich said.

« Speaking of ditferent barriers that make it difficult for
women to get abortions, Yelich described ﬁnancial and geo-
graphical difficulties, as well as the problems caused by mis-
information or a lack of information. She also described dis-
approval —-— from family, ﬁiends and religious groups —— as
a barrier faced by a woman seeking an abortion.

“What, as a group, can we do to possibly break down
these barriers for people under 18 —— that’s what I was just
talking about —-— or people who are our age, or people who
are older?” asked Yelich, who said she had recently gradu-
ated from college. “All people have dilferent barriers.”

State not abortion—friendly, panel says

Panel, page 3

have an abortion provider,” Yelich said.
Nine of the Commonwealth’s 67 counties
have such providers, according to NARAL-
PA information distributed by the panel.
According to the same literature, there
are more than “200 anti-choice crisis preg-
nancy centers, compared to only 15 accessi-
ble abortion clinics” in Pemisylvania.
“Things aren’t as accessible to women
and young women in the central part of the
state,” said Yelich. Apanelist later described
Pennsylvania as “Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh, with Alabama in between.”
“We have an anti-choice Senate in the
House,” Yelich said. ‘Thank God [Ed
Rendell]’s our governor.”
Ed Rendell promised to veto any anti-
abortion legislation, Yelich said
Describing what she said were
Pennsylvania’s biggest problems with abor-
tion, Yelich pointed to the requirements that
women wait 24 hours after first seeking the
counsel of a physician about abortion, that
ﬂrey receive “mandatory lectures” to dis-
suade them from having abortions, and the
restrictions placed on abortions for minors.
Yelich also described how a woman
seeking an abortion has the right to read
state-created papers describing the fetus,
accompanied by pictures of a fetus at differ-
ent points in development. The literature
also describes ﬂue psychological risks asso-
ciated with having an abortion, she said.
“In my opinion, that doesn’t really
belong there. It’s almost insulting,”.Yelich
said, adding that a Woman seeking an abor-
tion has already considered the emotional
and psychological troubles that can arise
from havingan abortion. I ,
The woman can also learn about agen-
cies ﬂiat olfer abortion alternatives and talk
about how an adoptive parent can pay for
the costs that come with pregnancy and giv-
ing birth, she added. 1
“Statistics say abortion is healthier than
pregnancy,” Yelich said, explaining" that
there are more health risks associated with
pregnancy and giving birth than With abor-
tion. - I
Telling the audience that there will like-
ly be one or two open spaces in the U.S.
Supreme Court during the next administra-
tion, Yelichlsaid that one new judge could
alter the current" single-judge majority in
favor of abortion. ..
“A lot of people don’t think we could
lose Roe,” Yelich said. “If Bush is allowed

to appoint [a Supreme Court judge], he’ll

put in an anti-choice judge”

Claire ‘Keyes, the executive director of
the Allegheny Reproductive Health Center,
agreed wiﬂi Yelich’s expression of urgency.

I “It’s true — the right to an abortion,

we’ve really kind of taken it for granted, ,

because ‘we’ve lived with it for 30 years,”
Keyes said, adding that “we’re living in a
diﬁerent time” now.

Several of the‘ women on the panel
asserted that abortion is an issue concerning
women, not children.

“Long before it was legal, [abortion]
has always been about hopes and dreams,”
Keyes said.

“People are looking to better their
lives,” she said. “I think there are more free-
doms for women [now]. At the same time,
there’s less and less support for abortion.”

Contrasting what she described as
increasing opposition to abortion, Keyes
pointed out that it is now muchjmare accept-
able for a woman to choose not to have any
children, compared to any time in the past

Keyes described the duties of a clinic as
treating the women -—— not only physically,
but emotionally as well.

“Not only are we providing the actual
[abortion] service, but we’re dealing with
ﬂie other elements of their lives,” Keyes
said of the women who she sees in the clin-
1c.

Keyes described one womanwho had
come into the clinic last week, right after she
found out that shewas pregnant.

The woman had been pregnant for 26

‘ week.

Explaining that the woman did not usu-
ally have regular periods, and thus  not
notice a missed period as a sign of pregnan-
cy, Keyes said that the woman had also been
taking a medicine that causes severe birth
defects. Only one clinic in the country could
perform the type of abortion the woman
needed, Keyes said — a clinic in VV1chita,
Kan., with a fee of about $6,000, not includ-
ing travel fees.

Keyes described another woman,
whom she said wanted to have a baby,
whose baby died several months into the
pregnancy. The woman had health care
through a Catholic hospital, Keyes said, and
consequently, she c_ould not get insurance
coverage to have the dead fetus removed in
a hospital. The insuranceprovider simply
told the woman to wait and deliver the fetus,
Keyes said.

“You just don’t even think about things I

like that —— the kind of accidental things that

happen in everyday people’s lives,” she

said. "

Asked to share her most rewarding and
most diﬂicult experiences, Keyes said that
many of her experiences fall into both cate-
gories. She ‘described a visibly troubled
mother, in her 50s, who accompanied her

35-year-old daughter to the clinic. The .

mother, Keyes said, “so clearly wanted to be
 [her daughter].” I

Keyes said that when she asked the '

mother what was wrong, thewoman said, “I ‘

don’tknow what to do. Do I stand beside
the teachings of my church, which say,
‘Don’t have anything to do with an abor-
tion,’ or do I stand beside my daughter?” ,

Reﬂecting on the time preceding the
Roe vs. Wade decision, Keyes said abortion
was no less common, but much more dan-
gerous.“

‘There used to be hospital beds ﬁlled
with women, and those were the women
who’d had abortions — but they weren’t
legal, and [women] used to die ﬁom them,”
she said. ‘ ,

FDA to evaluate dietary supplements

In a-bold announcement yester-
day, the Food and Drug
Administration decided to do its job.

The FDA, a regulatory agency in
charge of insuring that pharmaceuti-
cals are safe and the meatpacking
industry doesn’t look to Upton
Sinclair’s “The Jungle” for its prac-
tices, will now start to evaluate, and
possibly regulate, dietary supple-
ments.

Before this announcement, such
supplements could be marketed, with
labels cautioning that they hadn’t
been evaluated by the FDA, and
taken off the shelves only if the sup-
plement was proven sufficiently
harmful. .

With this announcement comes
thelong-needed decision to regulate
dietary, herbal and natural supple-
ments — the last of these being the
most vaguely named because, after
all, arsenic is an element, and it does-
n’t get much more natural than that.

Resultantly, the FDA is now
going stop that “Neon — it’ll give
you a healthy glow” supplement cam-
paign before it starts.

Good for the administration,
doing its job and preventing needless
kidney failure and death.

Introducing legitimate science
with all its rules and regulations -
like, for instance, peer-reviewed
studies, risk‘ assessment, testing for

possible side effects, and l-abeling
products properly — into the supple-
ment industry can only‘ be for the
common good.

Until now, the public has been the
testing ground for many supplements
efficacy and safety, which is unac-
ceptable.

This announcement comes in
tragedy’s wake, because, before these
regulations could be made, some of
these supplements had to be suffi-
ciently dangerous to ban.

Such ex post facto regulation
comes after Baltimore Orioles pitch-
er Steve Be1cher’s death, which has
been linked to ephedra, a popular
weight-loss supplement.

Hopefully, these regulations will

, prevent other such needless deaths.

‘ These regulations are especially
necessary when other pharmaceuti-
cals have been denied or delayed
because of insufficient or'inconclu-
sive tests, but the, supplements
allowed on the market.

According to Reuters, Michael

McGuffin, president of the American.

Herbal Products Association,
approves of these measures, saying
he wants the bad players out of the
game; ,

It’s about time that these, products
are subject to the same thorough
investigations as regular drugs —
after all, it’s only natural.

Pitt, is living the dream? Who is following
the example he left not exclusively for
blacks, but for all mankind The answer,
unfortrmately, is not many.

On Jan. _l9, the Black Action Society
and the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity mobi-

fourth armual candlelight vigil in memory

and Catholics.”

Let this not be taken as a scolding
indictment of the black community here at
Pitt, but rather as a glimpse of the reality in
which we live. Holidays have the power of
deluding the keenest of observers, letting
them see things that are not there.

Therefore, in the aftermath of King’s
holiday and memory, we should not delude
ourselves into thinking that King’s
prophetic words have come to pass. No,
God’s children have not joined hands. No,
black men, white men, Jews and gentiles
do not sing the old Negro spiritual in uni-
son. King was not a separatist by any
means. He did not suggest that blacks sep-

arate from white America to live
' independently; rather, he favored

dain for the hypocrisy of
some of Pitt’s black lead-
ers. At this event, not less than half of the

. crowd spoke of living King’s dream.

“We’re living King’s dream, they pro-
claimed.’ “We’re bringing his dream to
life,” they assured‘ themselves, with an air
of arrogance and haughtiness. This, how-
ever, is far from the truth and borders on
being an outright lie.

Although Pitt undoubtedly prides itself
on diversity, it cannot pride itself on the
integration + or lack thereof — among its
diverse population. Similar to our days in
high school, the blacks sit with the blacks,
the whites sit with the whites, the Asians
stick together, the Jews stick together, and
so on and so forth. And this is precisely
where we — not only blacks, but the entire

\ student body — have failed to effectuate

the dream: in not joining hands, in King’s

~ words, as God’s children, “black men and

age when blacks, whites, and
other racial groups are just as socially
divided as they have always been — albeit
without violent confrontation — King’s
desires are still but a dream.

I challenge readers to examine them-
selves. How many friends outside of your
own race do you have? Does interracial
dating disturb you? Does the group you
belong to on campus encourage and foster
interaction between groups whose mem-
bership is largely of another race? Does
your black fraternity or sorority host joint
events with white fraternities and sorori-
ties? For many of us, the answer to these
questions is a resounding no. And, until it
can be an unﬂinching, unwavering yes, we
will not be living the dream.

Israeli ambassador right to destroy anti-Semitic artwork

When I think of the United States’ — and free world’s
— war on tenor, I think of Iraq, Afghanistan, Homeland
Security and numerous other things somehow related to the
use of force. I doubt anyone thinks about art, let alone an art
exhibit in Sweden. ~

This is why you should: On Jan. 17, Zvi
Mazel, Israel’s ambassador to Sweden,
destroyed an art exhibit titled “Snow White
and ﬂre Madness of Truth.” In a premeditated
action, Mazel unplugged the three spotlights
illuminating the exhibit featuring what The
Jerusalem Post described as a “small ship car-
rying the picture of female suicide bomber
Hanadi Jaradat sailing in a rectangular pool
ﬁlled with blood-colored water.” Mazel threw
one of the spotlights into the pool, destroying
the exhibit.

Jaradat murdered 21 Israelis, including
several babies, when she detonated herself at
the Maxim restaurant in the Israeli port city of
Haifa ._

Numerous stories can be taken ﬁorn this event. One
could talk about the irony of the exhibit’s opening being
linked to an international forum on the preventionof geno-
cide. But this really isn’t much of a story. The irony is too
obvious — and it’s no surprise that the nation that gives us
Volvos and false hope for socialists would support suicide
bombers and accuse Israel of genocide, though they
remained “neu ” during World War II while supplying
Germany with the iron ore necessary to produce their
materiel.

Columnist

exhibit while its creator Dror Feiler watched. Mazel’s
actions raise all sorts of questions about taste and free

expression —.—- questions that are too deep to be explored in .

this column. What are interesting are Feiler’s thoughts after
seeing his anti—Sernitic hate-speech destroyed.

“People in Sweden who hear about this
say to themselves, if this is how an Israeli
ambassador who is supposed to be diplomatic
and restrained acts, how do the soldiers in the
occupied territories behave,” Feiler said.

For Feiler, and if he is to be believed, for
many Swedes, destroying hate-speech is a
greater cause for moral suspicion than blowing
oneself up in an act of mass murder. It would
be truly atrocious if Israeli soldiers destroyed
arms caches, weapons factories, and tunnels
used to smuggle arms with the deftness and
barbarism that Mazel used in destroying the
exhibit Insert sarcasm here.

If this really is the lens with which sup-

posedly sophisticated and intelligent Europeans View reali--

ty, then this is‘a story. .

Unfortunately, the story is that many of the United
States’ traditional allies in Western Europe can no longer be
counted on to stand up and defend the values that let them
create such ﬁlthinthe name ofart -

Despite being interesting, these stories fail to capture
the larger story here —- one of individual action. VV1th delib-
eration and forcefulness, Mazel, to put it crudely, gave
Feiler, Sweden, and those who would support Feiler’s pro-
ject “the bird.” Doing so requires courage and a moral con-

Mazel’s not-so-diplomatic destruction of hate-speech
struck a large, if symbolic, blow to an aspect of the war on
terrorism that often goes overlooked: the war of ideas. The
Islamic fundamentalism and culture of death prevalent in
Palestinian society, which produces suicide bombers like
J aradat, is dangerous to people who wish to live in peace
and security. When ﬁmdarnentalists and terrorists ﬁnd allies
in ﬂre West who are willing to explain and even celebrate
them as cultural phenomena and/or legitimate...resistance,
instead of understanding suicide bombing as perverse mass-
murder, the freedom of the West becomes imperiled. If the
brave men and women of our armed forces, intelligence
agencies and other security apparatuses are ever to win the
war on terror on the ground, the ideas that support and con-
done terror must also be defeated and discredited.

Mazel’s actions provide an individual reference for
how to win the war of ideas, regardless of his standing as a
government ofﬁcial. Though we need not employ his dra-
matics, we must assertively and forcefully speak out against
the elements in our Western society who would equivocate
with regards to, or defend, suicide—bombing — not to men-
tion other anti-Semitic tropes like reporting Jewish blood
libels in state—sponsored media and preaching a message of
death and destruction for Israel and the West at Islamic
places of worship. These, amongst numerous other
instances of anti—Sernitisnr, happen with regularity in the
Islamic world, as The Jerusalem Report noted Dec. 13,
2003. Our Western society, founded upon the freedom of
conscience, can only ﬂourish in safety when those of good
conscience are able to stand up to those of bad conscience.

There is a story in the fact that Mazel destroyed the

viction that are admirable.

Frist’s post—Iowa comments don’t present Democrats accurately

On CNN Jan. 19, when he wasn’t wlrin-
ing about how much coverage of the Iowa
caucuses he’d had to watch, U.S. Senate
Majority Leader Bill Frist, R—Tenn., said that
he wasn’t worried about which Democratic
candidate was nominated to run against
President George W. Bush in 10 months.

The reason, he said, was because of
the “consistency” of the arguments of
the candidates, which Frist shrewdly
described as “anti-war” and “anti-
Bus ”' .

Now, it’s hard for anyone to say that
we have a particularly edgy and exciting
group of candidates on the Democratic
side. I watched the thrill-packed joyride
that was the Democratic debate, and the
efforts of the party in which I have so
disgruntledly registered are more likely
to be soporiﬁc than inspirational.

But Frist’s comments are just the
kindthatkeepmeregistered-——andvoting
——Democrat. And they’re the kindthatkeep
me voting for people who lose.

You don’t need to like or agree with
Howard Dean, John Edwards, Wesley Clark
or any of the other thoroughly unenergizing
personalities bombarding primary polling
stations, but to say that there’s no difference
between them skips right over stupid and
goes straight to insulting. And one of them

will likely lose in November, because
they’re just not that good at eliminating small
differences in favor of oversimpliﬁed “anti-

 

something” rhetoric.

How on Earth does seeing problems
with this whole business in Iraq constitute
being “anti-war?” We didn’t even declare
war, and now the White House says the war
we didn’t declare, if it had ever actually
begun, is over. Clark is a four-star general; is
he against all war? If
someone says they
thinktheV1etna1nWar
wasn’t run “so well,
does that make him
anti-war? For the
record, every major

Then there’s this matter of being “anti-

ﬁst-shaking sore losers with a personal
vendetta against Bush, who’s really a nice‘
man and doesn’t deserve this irrational anger.

Not that politicians haven’t been hated

on a personal level. Richard Nixon made
everyone uncomfortable, and Bill Clinton
was hated with all of the passion the
Republican Party could muster, on levels far
more personal than professional. Remember
how there were no Newsweek “Love

In fact, the Dems are probably going to

Bush” enough. Democrats — the good ones,
at least —— like to talk about the intricacies of
a topic, and to ﬁnd all of the angles and

The King and JFK are al hook up

Bubba Ho-Tep

Starring Bruce Campbell, Ossie
Davis

Directed by Don Coscarelli
=.2n.“n2r1/2

Elvis is back in the building. But
where the King is now is a far cry
from his palace at Graceland.

Aging and with a damaged hip,
Elvis (Bruce Campbell) is bedridden
in a nursing home in Texas. He’s alone
with thoughts of his past — both of
the days the public knows of, and of

   

nuts. 1

“Bubba Ho-Tep” isn’t some
strange joke, although the set-up
might seem like one. Instead, it’s a
funny and touching film that takes the
ideas of conspiracy theorists every-
where _-— what if Elvis and JFK were
still alive —— and places them along-
side a stock horror movie idea — a
mummy coming back to life thanks to
an ancient curse. ‘

The film’s a buddy movie —-
Elvis and Kennedy work togeth-
er for a good half of the picture
— but our center is Elvis. We

ters in the

There’s been little
mention of the mummy
thus far because, truth
be told, the mummy’s
 not all that important.
5 He’s the catalyst for
Elvis and Kennedy get-
ting together, but that’s
it. He’s a sort of
MacGuffin. Instead, the
importance here is in the
interaction between
Elvis and Kennedy,
the witty banter

the years after his “death” that no one see more of what makes him from both, and
knows about. He’s wrestling with the tick than we do Kennedy. And C ampb ell’ s

family he longs for -— that he’s  mance as

To take care of the

problem, he joins ‘
forces with an expert '

former President of
the United States of .
America John 1
Kennedy (Ossie
Davis). But this
isn’t a Boomer’s

to.think he’s some forgotten, old man
gone loony, because we end up iden-
tifying so closely to" him. The expla-
nation given as to how Elvis is still
alive — involving Elvis lore and
impersonators in a way no other
theory ever has — is brilliant,_and
is a plot point that is best left to be
discovered. Kennedy, on the other
hand, looks like he’s just might be
a few marbles short — a fact made

all the funnier when Elvis, with

his own sanity being questioned,
calls Kennedy a nut job.

This isone of the charms of the
film, how the dialogue and action
are ironic while playing off the
' legends of both Elvis and Kennedy.
One of the most inspired moments
of this comes when Elvis calls
Kennedy to convince him to fight
the mummy. Kennedy, answering on
a red “hotline” phone made to
mimic the one the “real” Kennedy
» had in the ‘60s, hears Elvis say,
“Mr. President? Ask not what your
nursing home can do for you, but
b What you can do for your nursing
home.” Kennedy’s response to this
is, “You’re using some of my best

saw-for—a—hand evil—killer from the
“Evil Dead” movies. In “Bubba Ho-
Tep,” he goes beyond that character
and shows he has acting chops. But he
isn’t impersonating Elvis; he’s chan-
neling him. He conveys every move-
ment, lip twitch and sentiment as an
aged Elvis in hiding probably would
— with a guilty, tired soul. Davis
might be the more accomplished
actor, but Campbell is the man in this
film.

With most films vying for Oscars,
“Bubba Ho-Tep” offers pure enter-
tainment and drama with some sub-
stance. It isn’t going to change the
world, but it does give audiences one
of the most interesting — and unique
—— times at the movies. After all,
when’s the next time you’ll be able to
say, “I saw a movie where Elvis and
JFK fought a mummy in a Texas nurs-
ing home?”

“Bubba Ho-Tep” opens at The Oaks
Theater in Oakmont, Pa., on Friday.

Am DiFranco’s latest is art 

Educated Guess

Ani DiFranco

Righteous Babe Records
»i‘r7,‘n;‘ri‘r

Recommended if you like:
Joni Mitchell

Ani DiFranco’s newest CD, Educated
Guess, is a piece of art that makes you feel
the lyrics, because they are sung with a dis-
tinct emotion that ﬁts each word perfectly.
As a lyricist, DiFranco is second to none.
The poems interspersed throughout the
album, such as “The True Story of What
Was,” “Grand Canyon” and “Platforms,”
are read passionately by DiFranco, giving
the album a unique feeling. “Grand
Canyon” is especially poignant, witha verse
that reads, “I mean, no song has gone
unsung here and this joint is stnmg crazy
tight and people been raising up their voic-
es, since it just ain’t been right with all the
righteous rage.” _

The words she sings are empowering‘,

especially to _women._ Thehighlight of the _

album is “Origami,” with such lyrics as, “I
know men are delicate origami creatures/
who need women to unfold them/ hold
them when they cry/ but I am tired of being
your saviorl and I am tired of telling you
why.” I could imagine that men might ﬁnd
lyrics such as these to be less appealing than
a woman would, but it is easy to admit that
there is atbeat behind her words that pulses
throughout the song, despite the song being
acoustic. -

Most of the songs on the album are
acoustic, featuring DiFranco doing what she
does best with her guitar. The guitar work is

  interesting. Even the spoken-
'word pieces keep your interest with their
inherent rhythm.

Educated Guess is an important album

-for both its innovation and lyrics that mean
so much in the scheme of what goes on in
this world of ours. DiFranco has a unique
voice. This album is an evolution from her
last album, delving even deeper into the

V psyche of aiwoman With an unbridled spirit

and open mind.

Hang tough withislordan Knight at the Hard Rock Thursday night

 "A““tlecade ago, you were wearing
their buttons and T-shirts with your socks
pulled over your spandex and your
Tiffani Thiessen hair tamed by a
scrunchie. You and I were not the only
ones who fell asleep to “The Right Stuff’
playing in our ears with dreams of run-
ning our hands through Joey McIntyre’s
hair. , V

We were a part of their fan club,
along with thousands of other 7-year-old
girls. We were a part of an age that tied
our hand-me-down shirts in knots and
wore one overall strap on our shoulder.

We were the devoted followers of those
ﬁve hunky guys who were responsible for
the boy band phenomenon.

Jordan Knight, Donnie Wahlberg,

Joe McIntyre, Darmy Wood and Jon
Knight were the ﬁve hotties who made up
New Kids on the Block. We thought of
them as our little sisters think of
*NSYNC. If you were like me, and in
love with these guys, you may have often
wondered what they did after hits such as
“Hangin’ Tough” stopped being request-
ed on pop radio stations.

 

And you found that you were crying yourself to sleep
when you had to put your Jordan locket in your jewelry
chest to gather dust. '

A decade later, you were shaking off the cobwebs
and wearing his face proudly around your neck again.
Knight’s solo career took off with “Give It to You,” and

9 you couldn’t seem to hide your smile.

‘After his hit single came out in 1999, along with a

straight, fall to Hurricanes

SHAUNNA STUCK
~ Staff Writer

Pitt’-s two—game conference winning streak ended
Sat’urday“in“Miami>with-a 77-68 loss to,the No. 21
Hurricanes.

Miami (15-1, 4-1 Big East), playing without its
leading scorer, ‘Tamara James, who was outwith a

“sprained neck, took advantage of Pitt’s 27jturnovers to

record the victory. ‘

;  Senior forzward LaToya Kincaid fell short of».

her third consecutive double-double, scoring a game-
high 21 points and pulling down a team-best eight
rebounds. All but two of Kincaid’s points came in the
closing half. She also added two steals.

Pitt came within two points of the lead at the mid-
way point of the first half, after an 8-2 run, but Miami

, eventually broke away. After a 20-8 run, the

Hurricanes closed out the first half with a 38-24 lead.
With a little more than 10 minutes left in the

game, Miami extended its lead to 17 points, but was _
‘answered with a 12-3 Panthers’ rally that cut the lead

down to seven.

This was as close as Pitt would come; the

.Hurricanes rolled on to remain unbeaten in eight

straight games at home. Miami also extendedits series
success, with four straight victories over the Panthers.

Pitt and Miami were evenly matched in field goal
percentage (42 percent) and were comparable» from
the charity stripe.

The Hurricanes had 21 steals to the Panthers’
eight. However, Miami only ﬁnished one-of—10'from
behind the arc, compared to Pitt’s 44 percent (four-of-
nine). ~ S “

Freshman guard Brooke Hughes made three of i
' Pitt’s three-pointers, chipping in 12 points and a team-
‘ high five assists. ’

Freshman forward Jennifer Brown led the
Panthers off the bench with 15 points, seven rebounds
and four blocks in 29 minutes of work.

Miami’s Shaquana VV1lkins led the Hurricanes
with a double-double, pulling down a game-high 15
boards and 20 points. Forward Chanivia Broussard
and guard Hutashi Wilson each scored in double dig-
its for the Hurricanes. _

Pitt will be back in action Wednesday night in Big
East Conference play to battle another tough oppo-
nent, No. 19 Virginia Tech, at home. ’

Pitt men swim past three
teams over the weekend

BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer

Both , the Pift men’s
women’s swimming and diving
team took part in multiple matches
this past weekend. The No. 17
men’s team completed a clean
sweep, defeating Notre Dame, 228-
123, Maryland, 258-93, and
Villanova, 298-49. The three victo-
ries improve the team’s record_to 8-
1 (4-0 in the Big East) on the sea-
son. I

The women’s team participated
in two meets, defeating Villanova,
228-125, but losing 233-114 to No.
19 Maryland. The women now
stand at 6-2 (3-1) on the season.

Men

Pitt’s men’s team easily won its
three matches over the weekend. On
Saturday, Pitt won seven of 10
events, including a sweep in both
diving events by Dennis
Nemtsanov. Nemtsanov received
299.9 points, finishing 26.2 points
ahead of his teammate, Matthew
Schwartz. The Panthers also swept
both relay events, the 400—meter
freestyle relay and the 200-meter
medley relay.

After being beaten by a split
second in the 500-meter freestyle,

Eric Limkemann bounced back with V

a win in the 200-meter freestyle
event, coming in just.0.03 seconds
in "front of Maryland’s Chris
Brandenberger. After helping the
400-meter medley relay team to
victory, Jason Miller won first place
in the 200-meter individual medley,
and came up just 0.17 seconds
behind Notre Dame’s Tim
Kegelman for first place in the;200-
meter butterﬂy.

Other Panthers victors Saturday
included Jeff Leath in the 200-

140, the Maryland men defeated
Villanova, 279-54, and Notre Dame
also defeated Villanova, 282-51.

Women

Pitt’s women’s team started off
slow Friday afternoon in the two-
day event. The team had only one
individual victory coming on the
one-meter diving competition by

Colleen Kristobak. Pitt was able to ‘

finish second in a couple events,
including‘ the 200-meter medley
relay. ‘

Carolyn Savini finished second

9 K‘! 

Defense will determine who will win the Super Bowl

 

If there’s one thing to be learned
from this weekend’s NFL conference
title games, it is: The old adage that
“defense wins championships” is still
very much alive. '

This is no new concept, but it’s one
that I went against when picking the

Eagles and the Colts to advance to Super ,

Bowl XXXVIII. I just couldn’t look past
Peyton Manning’s two incredible play-
off performances. And after watching
Donovan McNabb lead Philly to a 20-17

‘ overtime win over Green Bay, I. thought

I had this year’s title games all figured
out.

But time and time again, defense
has proved to be the determining factor
in conference championship games.

New England’s defense was just too
quick off the snap and caused problems
for Manning and the Colts all afternoon.
After cruising through the first two
rounds of the playoffs without an inter-
ception or even having to punt, the Colts
allowed four sacks and committed five
turnovers, three of which came in the
form of interceptions by Patriots corner-
back and Aliquippa native Ty Law.

Tom Brady and the offense did what
they had to do. They took advantage of
opportunities. when they presented

‘themselves, protected the football, and

were not afraid to settle for field goals.
Kicker Adam Vinatieri was brilliant

once again, ‘hitting all five ‘of his ’

attempts despite the sloppy ﬁeld condi-
tions.

Carolina’s defense‘ dominated its
game in similar fashion. But it was
rookie defensive back Ricky Manning
Jr. and his three picks that stole the show
— and the chance to go to the Super
Bowl —— from McNabb and the Eagles.

Philadelphia receivers certainly did i

not helptheir own cause. Dropped balls

and poorly run routes were a problem all '

night. And despite a valiant effort to
play with a rib injury, McNabb and the
magic of “fourth and 26” were erased by
a third consecutive NFC championship

V game loss.

But for‘the Eagles, the loss should

I not be shouldered solely by the perfor-

mance of the offense. Poor tackling, par-
ticularly when three players failed to
wrap up DeShaun Foster on his one-'
yard touchdown run, proved to be a big
problem for the Eagles’ defense.

The Eagles are guaranteed to see

r::v.

proof? Look no further than the combi-
nation of plenty of salary cap room and
free agency. Starting comerbacks Troy
Vincent and Bobby Taylor, starting line-
backer Carlos Emmons, and tailback
Duce Staley are now all eligible for
unrestricted free agency. Some of that
cap room should be invested in a receiv-

‘ er, someone who could take at least

some of the pressure off of McNabb.
But enough about that’. I
Super Bowl XXXVIII will feature
two teams that boast two of the strongest
defenses in the NFL. Both of these
defenses are known for ﬂying to the
football and hitting people in the mouth. ‘

The game will also feature two '

quarterbacks who have traveled similar

=paths.

Tom Brady owns a perfect 5-0 ‘post-
season record as a starter. It’s still way
too early to tell where he will fit in with
the all-time greats,‘ but another Super
Bowl victory would put Brady well on
his way to securing himself a spot
alongside signal callers like Roger

Staubach, Joe Theismann, Terry
Bradshaw, and —— dare I say —— Joe
‘Montana.

Jake Delhomme is currently in his
first season as a starter, and his‘ team is
the underdog heading into the game.

Sound familiar?

Brady was in Delhomme’s shoes
two years ago when no one gave the
Patriots a chance against the heavily
favored Rams.

The Patriots and Panthers both have 2

their defenses to thank for propelling
them into the Super Bowl. You can be
sure that no matter which team comes
away with the game’s ultimate reward,
strong defensive play will be the deci-
sive factor.

the match with two takedowns and two reversals. The last
