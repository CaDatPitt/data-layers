Bikini Test
A-Observer
Speaks

The author of what has be en
called one of the most impor-
tant books on the effects of the
atom bomb will speak at Stephen
Foster Memorial tomorrow at
2:30 p.m.

Dr.David Bradley was an eye-
witness observer at the atom
bomb experiments at Bikini in
.1946. His book title, "No Place
to Hide”, will be the same as
that of his speech. It is an ac-
count of the events that took
place at Bikinj.

Dr. Bradley, an Army medical of-
ficer attached to Manhattan Project,
was trained for the specific job of
radiological monitor for the Bikini
test. He was one of the men who
determined the amount of radioac-
tivity in the targets after the bomb
had exploded, a decision which Dr.
Bradley describes as "a prerequi-
site to survival in an atomic age”.

During’ the five and a half months
at Bikini, he had ample opportuni-
ties to study the effects of atomic

radiation on marine, plant, and ani-
mal lif’e. These observations were
recorded in his diary which was
originally intended as an article
for the Atlantic Monthly. The article
was expanded into a book which
was published in December, 1948,
after serialization in the Atlantic
Monthly.

Coal Strike Being Felt  

Phi Kappas
Pot Boiling

The Phi Kappa pot is boiling
again. Robert A. Jarvis, attorney
for the fraternity men, and Ella
Graubart, lawyer representing Ham-
pton Hall Apartments, have both
filed exceptions to the final ruling
on the case handed down by Judge
A. Marshall Thompson.

The suit was supposedly settled
on Jan. 3, by Judge Thompson"s
decision on the case. Under the
exceptions which have been filed
however, both sides are in effect
challenging this decision.

It was on.Sept. 28 that Hampton
Hall residents Henry K. Kirk-Pat-
rick and Wilson in their suit sought
to stop alleged necking and noise
making in the back yard of the Phi
Kap house.

According to Jarvis, Ella Grau-
bart filed the first exception to the
case.
was the fact that Judge Thompson
issued no injunction to stop the
Phi Kaps from parking in ‘their
back yard. _

In Judge Thompson's original
decision, Jhowever, the Phi Kaps
are limited to day time parking and
no parking after midnight or before
daylight. ’It is this point which
Jarvis is contesting.

Health Policy
Payments Due

Payments for Studeat Health and
Hospital Insurance applied for
during spring registration must be
made at the Student Desk on the
ground floor of the Cathedral by
Feb. 28. ’

‘Also, all students residing in
housing facilities provided by the
University must apply for this in-
surance. ‘

I Women students living in sorority
houses have always had to take
out this insurance. Coverage for
men living at DeSoto Hall was made
mandatory at the beginning of the
1949-50 school year.

Student Health and Hospital In-
surance is a special service pro-
vided by the University. For a
$6.20 fee, students are insured
until Fall Registration, 1950.

curred through outside care up to
the aggregate limit of $500 for each

Auto Collides with Truck;
Pharmacy Students Injured

Two Pitt pharmacy students are
in serious condition in Citizens
General Hospital in New Kensington
after smashing into a milk truck on
Route 28, two miles west of New
Kensington Thursday.

Three other passengers in the
car, including two other pharmacy
students were released from the
hospital after examination. Russel
J. Hope, 35, driver of the truck, is
in satisfactory condition in the
same hospital with a possible frac-
tured skull.

The four men, James Murtland,
Rudy Mauro, Hugo Caruso, and
James Ryan, were on their way to
classes at Pitt when their car
skidded into the milk truck at 7:40
a.m. The fifth rider, Tech coed
Jane Dickey, was detained for ex-
amination but not admitted to the
hospital.-

Caruso and Mauro are termed in
serious condition by attending
doctors. Caruso has a possible
fractured skull, is well as a frac-
tured right arm, right leg, and pel-

Mauro has been confirmed to have

According to the hospital’s emer-
gency accident report, the car,
carrying five passengers and driven
by James Murtland, skidded on the
icy road and slipped over into the
opposite lane to crash into the
milk truck.

At the time of the accident Hope’s
milk truck was traveling towards
New Kensington. It had just passed
Springdale. The Murtland car was
passing in the opposite direction
over the three-lane highway.

When the car slipped over into
the opposite lane it smashed di-
rectly into the truck. Crushed in the

Dave Cleland
Leaves Pitt

Pitt had a first class mystery
on its hands when Student Con-
gress and IF Council discovered
that Dave Cleland was not to be
found.

The mystery of the whereabouts
of the social chairman of Congress
and IF has apparently been solved.
Reliable sources informed the News
that Cleland "just got disgusted
with Pitt and quit.”

Last semester Cleland held re-
sponsible positions in Congress
and IF and was considered a power-
ful influence in both organizations.
He gave no indication before the
vacation that he would not be back.

Student Congress speculated the
past week on whether Cleland will
return or not. When asked if she

would appoint a new social chair-
man, Flora Diemert, Congress
president, replied that she didn’t
know if she still had the old one.
IF Council is now seeking appli-
cations for the vacated position.

Rumor

The nation’s prolonged coal
strike began to show positive‘
signs of affecting the Universi-
ty’s heating situation yesterday.

Already heating units in ome
nonessential areas such as corri-
dors and entrances have been shut
off, according to Raymond L. Coss,‘
superintendant of buildings and
grounds. -

This was done, he explained, in
an effort to comply with the request
of the Bellefield Boiler Plant, the
University's heat supplier, to con-
serve as much heat as possible.

James Austin, public relations
director of the boiler plant, said
that he could foresee no immediate
possibility of a curtailment if the
plant’s coal orders come through.

It was reported earlier that the
heat suppliers had a week’s supply
of coal. on hand.

, No Shutdown Yet

There will be no shutdown of
school tomorrow, as was rumored.
The question of whether heat will
be cut off or drastically reduced »
hinges on whether the Bellefield
Plant can afford to allow its pres-_».
ent supply to dwindlecmuch lower,
depending on the filling of their
orders.

Mr. Briggs reported that the light
company was still getting coal "not

that industries were the main suf-
ferers because of the latter fact.

one that will have students and

The answer to socialized medi-
cine “boils down to the question
of whether or not one desires a so-
cialized state,” according to Dr.
William S. McEllroy, dean of the
School of Medicine. A

“Socialized medicine is just a
phase of state socialism,” Dr. Mc-
Ellroy said in an interview. “It
means the sacrifice of certain per-
sonal freedoms to bureaucratic con-
trol.” :
"I would much rather see the vol-
untary health insurance‘ plans ex-
panded to take care of the economic

problems of medical service.”
The Med School dean contended

that the administration of medicine
on a national scale would require
an elaborate system of procedure
involving tremendous Costs. The
burden of this added expense would
fall unevenly onthe shoulders of

ponents of socialized medicine that
medical services are unavailable to
a large percentage of the popula-

He expressed the opinion that
“such reports are grossly exagger-

"is not for greater expansion but‘
for higher quality in medical prac-
tice.”

Contrary to this need, Dr. Mc-
Ellroy pointed out, the socializa- V
tion of medicine has "definitely
lowered medical standards" in
England. He-attributed this mainly
to the "destruction of personal in-
centive.”

“Raising the quality of medical
service is a matter of education-
the careful selection and better ,
training of medical personnel,” he
said. ,

According to Seldon D. Bacon and Robert Strauss, of the Sec-
tion on Alcohol Studies at Yale University, a survey of the drink-

ing habits of American college stu-
dents will be conducted. Since there
are no available figures on the
drinking situation in American col-
leges, the men conducting this poll
hope to clarify the situation.

Their clarification may or may
not help to dispel the distorted
views thatmany people have formed
on the subject, but just to insure

Baker’s Dozen

By LEN BAKER

If the "Maher-Ewart plan” for the rebirth of an independent
social organization at Pitt is successful, it will not be the first
time that the independents have held a high hand on the campus.

Before the war, the independents equalled the now-powerful
Interfraternity Council. From the Spring of 1938 to 1940 the frats
held first the small end of the political power with a gradual in-

crease in strength.

In 1938 the independents split. Some played a lone hand, while

the majority teamed up with a coali-
tion of the frats and the dental
school. I

Coalition Wins

This three-factioned coalition
took 27 of the 30 seats on the
Student Faculty Association As-
sembly, the student governing body
at that time.

The next year there was a clean
break between the frats and inde-
pendents with the independents
showing their first sign of weak-
ness. The frats took a majority of
four seats on the SFA making’ the
the score 17 to 13 in their favor.

In 1940 the independents made
their last great showing. In poli-
tical conflict again with the frats
they took only 11 seats as opposed
to the rats 19. j V

I

V Social Success
The first independent organiza-
tion which was primarily social in
purpose was also organized in
1940. The "Big.Eyeball” Dance,
their biggest social affair of the

year is representative of their suc-
cess ‘

and out of class is concerned. At
least, the types illustrated in The
University Hatchet look familiar.

Genius Rare Type

One of the rare types, often flat-
tered by imitation here at Pitt, is
the go nius.He just sits motionless,
until the professotmakes a pro-
found statement which no one un-
derstands, then slowly nods his
head up and down. The genius has i
no friends except other geniuses
-and knows about girls from the‘
movies.

A more common type is the note-
taker... He averages 200 pages Of
notes per course per semester and
takes notes when the professor
talks about the trip he took last
summer. Come time to study for a
test, he borrows somebody else’s
notes. Can’t read his own.

But the type who takes hold Of
college where the plumage is 813'
breviated is the fraternity man. He
cannot study alone so is never seen
in school. Because of the fine her-
itage he and his brothers enjoy, he
becomes an expert on filing cabi-
nets:

Socially it went over with a bang,
but financially it flopped. Its fail-
ure is generally credited to the non-
support’ of the frats. At that time
fraternity support was a necessity
to insure any ever_it’s financial
success.

The war came in 1941 and ushered
out the independents as an effec-
tive voice in student affairs. Since
then the voice has remained, a low
whisper.

Heated Election

One seat went to the Indepen-
dents in the 1948 election and two
in last Spring’s election.

This last‘ election wasdprobably
the most heated in Pitt’s political
history. The independents put up
an impressive show but captured
only the two seats on Student Con-
gress.

While there» are some present
attempts to organize the indepen-
‘dents again,'*no one believes that
the frats will have any competition
when it comes to casting ballots
this Spring. ~

Best Years of Life

The phenomenon of changing at-
titude towards your school through
the years is well described in this
bit from The Cannon Knight, Can-
non College publication titled ‘Col-
lege Progression: A

Frosh: "I don’t know whether I

like it here or ‘not.”
"It's OK, butl hate to
get back to the grind.”
Junior: "I'm almost glad to get
back. Not so bad after
all.’’ ,
Senior: "Not long now; hate to
leave.” ,
"The best years of my
life.”

A good example of frustration is

‘to look out the window of an elev-

enth floor classroom and watch one
of the‘city’s finest pastinga park-
ing tag on your windshield. Seriously
though, the parking situation is
something that needs looked into.
When you go to class you can't take
it with you.

One enterprising student is con-
templating a count of all the cars
that are parked crossways and
helter-skelter; sometimes taking
as many as three parking spaces.
He then plans to turn his results
overjto Student Congress to see if
something can be done to get the
culprits in line.

It was Student Congress that

took the initiative in having the
Schenley Park lot line off. Per-
haps they can help instigate an
enforcement of the lines.

Len Casanova as head coach. The

Stop Me if-

Attorney Frank Butler,‘ who
teaches an evening course in journ-
alism, told one at his initial class
session that is worth repeating.
The son of wealthy parents was
reported" dead in Cleveland. The
parents wired to a Cleveland under-
taker to "spare no expense” in the
cost of preparing the body for bur-
ial. As the undertaker was complet-
ing his preparation, the parents
walked in to see the boy.

At that moment the jaw of the
corpse dropped, exposing dental
work that proved definitely that
the man on the table was the wrong
stifftt

After the parents had left, the
undertaker turned to the cadaver
and said, "Now you’ll wind up in
some Potter's Field. If you'd have
kept your damned mouth shut, we'd
both be better off.”

2 Scots,'2 Pitt Men
In Verbal Clash

The first international collegiate debate here since 1937 will
be held tomorrow night at Stephen Foster Memorial at 8:30 
The topic to be debated by two Scots and two Pitt men is, "Is
Liberty Threatened by the Welfare State?"

Malcom David Webster-Low from the University of Edinburgh,

a medical interne, and David D.T.
Reid, a law student at the Univer-
sity of Glasgow, will oppose Pitt's
Franklin Blackstone and David

' Rhodes, both now in law school.

Topic Pertinent
The British general election on

    

Blackstone Rhodes
Thursday makes this topic particu-
larly pertinent to the present ec-
onomic situation on both sides of
the Atlantic. Tomorrow’s debate
will see the Pitts defending the
affirmative against the Scots in ‘the

‘ liberty vs. welfare state issue.

Webster holds M.B. and Ch.B.
(Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor
of Surgery)while Reid, an M.A., is

son. Rhodes, as a junior, was on
the two-man team that won a na-
tional tourney over teams from 65
other colleges.

Tomorrow night's debate is -co-

chief justice of the court.

"The purpose of the court,” says
Wolfe, “is to meet with and coun-
sel offenders of any as-pect of the
freshman orientation program. We
do not sit merely as a dignified
hazing body.”

Commenting on the orientation
program thus far, Wolfe has ex-
pressed his satisfaction at the
cooperation of the freshmen. "I am
especially happy to see that the
dink program has been complied
with. No doubt the freshmen have
realized that the dinks make them
far more attractive to freshman
women.”

Dental School Experiments

With Tooth Decay Treatment

By RAY CRISTINA
The much discussed sodium fluoride treatment as a preventa-
tive of tooth decay is a routine procedure in the School of Dent-
istry, Dr. Clarence W; Hagan, professor of pedodontrics, disclosed

in an interview.

"For the past two orgthree years we have been applying sod-

ium fluoride to the teeth of the
patients in the children's clinic,”
the head of that clinic stated.

Treatment Effective

“Although we can't be certain
of the results here,” Dr. Hagan
added, "the sodium fluoride treat-
ment has proven effective in ex-
tensive control experiments and
has been accepted by the American
Dental Association."_

It takes about ten years to deter-
mine the results of such treatment
in reducing tooth decay,” be ex-
plained. V

The’ two per cent solution of
sodium fluoride has been shown to
provide the maxium protection, the
doctor continued. It reduces tooth
decay on an average of 40 per cent.

Stops Decay -

The treatment consists of four
applications-, about a week apart.
The solution is allowed to dry on
the enamel which absorbs the fluor-
ide and becomes less susceptible
to decay.

"This topical application of

sodium fluoride acts as a protec-
tive agent,” Dr. Hagan stressed,
“not as a cure-all. This treatment
will not cure existing cavities.”

As yet, the doctor
sodium fluoride applications on
the teeth of adults have not been
found very effective, but research
in this field is still going on.

Officers Elected

New officers were elected at a
recent meeting of the student branch
of the American Institute of Elec-
trical Engineering. Those elected
are A.C. Schwotzer, chairman; R.].

. COUNTER ATTACK - Two erstwhile Pitt students, Jay Palley and
his wife, the former Adelaide Joseph , small talk with a customer at
their newly opened lunch counter in the YMHA. Palley, ai"l948 graduate
With a major in chemistry, has switched from test tube to bottle washing.

Chemistry Grad Opens
YMHA Cafeteria

By BERNICE RIVLIN

Some graduates get jobs, some pound the streets, others like
Jay Palley become expert coffee tasters and meat testers.

Jay, a Spetember 1948 chemistry graduate, has switched from
washing test tubes to polishing silver in a‘ year and a half.
I After leaving Pitt, Jay was equipped to conduct complicated,

experiments and prove technical
hypotheses. But like many college
graduates he found his talents else-
where and this week he opened his
own cafeteria in the YW8tMHA.

Busy Planning

Jay took the cafeteria over after
it had been closed for eight months.
Now he is busy planning menus and
putting up fixtures for the remodeled
lunch room. The cafeteria will
feature all kinds of sandwiches and
soft dirnks, plus special short
orders of french fries, vegetables
and salads. One hot special plate-
lunch will be offered every day.

The cafeteria will be open Mon-
day through Thursday 10 a.m. to
11 p.m. Fridays it will be open
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and will not
open again until Saturday at 1 p.m.
Sunday hours are 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.

Coffee Cheaper

Probably the biggest
Jay’s cafeteria has to offer is
coffee at the low price of five
cents when purchased with a meal.
Coffee alone is seven cents, one
cent less than Tuck Shop price of
eight cents.

Opening a cafeteria doesn't only
mean printing menus and making
sandwiches. "It's something dif-
ferent every minute,” Jay said’.
Two days before the opening he
and his wife were frantically pac-
ing the floor waiting for their sinks
to arrive. They had visions of

special

piles of dirty dishes stacked in
the kitchen.
The funniest experience deve-

loped the day they got the cash
register key. Jay hunted every-
where for it and finally remembered
he’d locked it in the cash register
-- "for safe keeping.”

Chemist Now Chef

Jay, one-time solution mixer, is
now head chef at the "Y” restau-
rant. His wife will help with the
short orders and a waitress will do
the serving. '

His wife, the former Adelaide
Joseph, was also a Pitt studnet.

TWO DECADES -- Dean of Men Theodore W. Biddle, Chancellor
Rufus Fitzgerald, and Mrs. Biddle at the testimonial dinner honoring
the dean for 20 years service. His associates and IF Council presented

him with a pen-and-clock desk set.

Dean Biddle Honored

At Testimonial Dinner

Theodore W. Biddle, dean of men, was honored by his associ-
ates and the Intrafraternity Council for twenty years of faithful
service at a testimonial dinner given last Thtrsday at the Pi

Kappa Alpha Fraternity house.

Dean Biddle was presented a pen-and-clock desk set and a

book of congratulations from his
associates.

"The University needs such a
person today,” Chancellor Rufus
H. Fitzgerald, oné of the speakers
said. “We cannot overemphasize
the character, integrity, and pa-
tience which you sometimes need
in the dean’s office.”

Dean Biddle was also praised by
Dr. Vincent Lanfear, Dean of the
School of Business Administration,
whom he succeeded as dean of men
in 1941.

“He has an honest sincere inter-
est in the students and spends
many sleepless nights and endless

-hours of activity. No man knows as

much about the extra-curricular ac-
tivities and no one gives himself
more completely to activities and
the students’ welfare than he does,”
Dr. Lanfear said.

The committee for the dinnerwas
as following: chairman, William H.

‘ Ferguson; dinner chairman, G6 orge

H. Hitchens; entertainment chair-
man, Melvin Silver.

The tribute to Dean Biddle on
the program stated that today he
looks forward with every increasing
earnestness, enthusiasm, and acu-
men to even greater interest and
success in helping students than
in years past.

Doc Ready

For Tech,
Madison Sq.

By WILL DOERGE
Dr. H.C. Carlson may yet have
a winning basketball team this
season.

The Panther
named coach of the

coach has been
Eastern All-

Stars who will meet an All-West
team in the annual Fresh Air Fund
charity game in Madison Square
Garden on April 1.

The announcement of Carlson’s
acceptance by the New York Herald
Tribune, sponsors of the affair,
came just before his Pitt five
dropped an 85-55 decision to West-
minster at Farrell Saturday.

Tech Tomorrow

Doc's hapless ‘club resumes its
rivalry with Carnegie Tech to-
morrow night on the Skibo floor at
8:30.

“I appreciate the honor of being
selected to coach the East team,”
said Carlson. "I am very pleased
and flattered by the choice.

"But,” the Panther mentor added,
"I have no delusions of grandeur.
It is only a kindly gesture on their
part to an old ‘Fading Gloi-y’.”

Carlson feels the Eastern coach-
ing post is an honor comparable to
two other awards he received re-
cently after his long tenure as
coach. He was the recipient of the
Coaches Association Silver Cup
in 1948 for an "outstanding con-
tribution to basketball,” and in
1949 he was awarded the Helms
Foundation coaching medal.

All Seniors

"I’ll meet my team about a week
before the game is’ scheduled,”
explained Carlson, “There will be
ten players on each squad, and
they’ll all be seniors.

"No player selections have been
made as yet, although the Tribune

committee is considering such.

IM volleyball will begin on

In a joyous celebration in the
locker room after the meet, one
Pitt swimmer remarked: "I guess
that proves that last year's loss
was afluke.” .

Even Now

Penn State had practically the
same team that upset the Panthers
last year, 38-37.

Bill Cochran, captain of the team,
tersely summed up the feeling of
the squad when he said, "We’re
even.”

Coach Ben Grady obviously very
much pleased with the decisive
win, stuck to true coaching form,
however. “The boys were up,”
he said, "they swam a good race.
But now we have Kenyon and Rut-
gers to worry about.”

Three Records Set

The three new pool records were
set by jim Zentgraf in the 440-
yard free style, Bob Gover in the
200-yard breast stroke, and the
300-yard medley relay team, com-
posed of Al Baran, Gover, and
Jules Melograne.

Zentgraf also took the other dis-
tance event, the 220-yard free style.

Al Ciocca continued his champ-
ionship diving form even though
handicapped by the low, non-spring
board.

After the meet was completed,
the spectators were treated to a
clown-diving act, put on by two
freshman divers, Tom Blosser and
Jim Mcllale.

has now had a total of six coaches.

Herb Douglas
Loses Title

By SAM SPATTER

Herb Douglas’ jinx continued
Saturday evening at the National
AAU indoor games in New York's
Madison -Square Gardens, when the
former Panther ace failed to retain
his broad jumping crown.

Ever since 1945, when he first
won his crown. Douglas has had the

"  ill luck of win-
’ ning, then losing
his title. ,This
year rpoved no ex-
ception.\He won
the title in 1945,
slost it in 1946,
regained it in
1947, lost it again
in 1948, recap-
tured it in 1949,
but dropped it
- once more in 1950.

Douglas (Buddy) Fowlkes of the
New York Athletic Club, became
the new titleholder with a jump of
2'5 feet, 5-3/4 inches. Lorenzo
Wright of Wayne was a close sec-
ond with a leap of 24 feet, 5-3/4
inches. Defending champion Doug-
las was third with a mark of 23
feet, 9-1/8 inches.

In winning the title, Fowlkes
bested two former Olympic stars in
Wright and Douglas. It was Doug-
las who scored a leap of 25 feet,
3 inches in the Olumpic tryouts, to
gain a spot on the 1948 American
'eam. I

   
  
  
   

Douglas

   

Len Casanova, has sounded a

of the University. Casanova wired
the News that "the cooperation,
friendship and understanding of all
friends of Pitt is needed to achieve
football success.”

He should arrive in Pittsburgh
sometime this week -- perhaps to-
morrow. “Hope to be with you in
a few days,” his Sunday night
telegram said.

The wire, answering a request
for a message to students, express-
ed anxiety over the difficult 1950 ‘
schedule, the loss of key men, and.
the switch from single wing to T-
formation football.

Backfield a Problem

' Casanova acknowledged his big-
gest headache to be the molding of
a strong backfield. Three of last
year's starting quartet will “he
graduated.

Text of Casanova’s message:
"The friendly messages frorii
Pitt alumni and students are very,

reassuring to me - and. my two
assistants, Jack Roche and Herm
Meister.

I believe that Pitt can maintain,

wand I hope continue forward, its

football progress. The cooperation,
friendship and understanding of
all friends of Pitt is needed to
achieve football success. With a
difficult schedule for 1950 and the :
loss of many key men from the
fine 1949 squad, the task ahead
will not be easy. Switching from a
single-wing style of offense to a
T-formation system will not be
simple.

Likes Line Prospects

However, from my examination
of 1949 game movies I am pleased
to“ learn that Pitt has some very ,
capable players available - parti-
cularly in the line. My assistant
coach, Herm Meister, is acknowl-
edged one of the top line coaches
in the game. I-le’ll do a competent
job with the forward wall, I am
sure. Jack Roche’s, job appears to
to be more difficult, due to the fact
that many fine backs have graduated.

We are enthusiastically looking
forward to spring practice, meeting
the squad, students, faculty and
hope to be with you in a few days.”

"Mighty strong straight ahead

chips when he gets in the clear,”
declared Sudsy, now an assistant
coach at Duquesne. "A little weak

a naturalquick starter when it comes
\ to the straight buck.

_ ‘ “I never told him to go to Pitt,
although of course we talked about
the situation down there from time
to time during the football season.
I guess he liked what he heard.

S "He certainly made a smart
choice. There were more than 45
schools wooing him in a big way
‘before he decided to stay at home.
I can’t say I ever regretted for a
moment that I stayed in the district
/when I chose my college.

“That one year as a halfback

four years on the track team got me
a coaching job right here in my

the job.

Ed Sudsina, the game little runt who ran the distance events
for Pitt track teams before graduating last June, was on the phone

possibly others not known. A

It’s safe to say that this land-
slide of offers did not occur be-
cause Nassida plays a good game
of chess.

Only two other high school backs
in these parts were so catered to
this season. One was California
High’s John Konek, for whom Pitt
is angling, and the other is MC-_
Keesport’s Fran Paterra, about
whom Sudsina has an interesting
observation. '

“It’s true Paterra has applied
for enrollment at Notre Dame,” he
says, “but that was before Casano-
va was hired as Pitt coach. At Mc-
Keesport Fran played a wide open
T, andl understand that with T-man
Casanova around, he might be
talked into withdrawing that Notre
Da.me application.”

Sudsy is only a stone’s throw
from McKeesport. So he may have
something. But doubtless Pitt hands
are already fast at work on the
matter.

8)’ DAVE POLLOCK
Football, basketball, baseball
—-these sports keep thousands of

Pitt students in a dither through-
out the calendar year. But they
have failed to make much of an im-
pression on Yussuff Ibrahim.

The Indian exchange student ad-
mits that America's major spectator
sports are "okay,” but the okay
sounded more like an apology for
their silliness rather than an en-
dorsement.

Before coming to Pitt, where he
is studying international law, Yus-
suff lived in Bombay. While attend-
ing the university there, he took
part in his favorite sports, soccer
and running. So when soccer was
added to the IM sport schedule this
year at Pitt, it didn't take Ibrahim
long to get into the act. The Indian
youth is now a member of the intra-
mural Yankees.’ Q

Better in India

Yussuff feels that soccer in his
native land is better played than
that in America.

"I haven’t seen the better teams
play here,” he admits, "but what
I have seen -doesn't compare with
soccer in India.”

In his 18 months in“America,
Yussuff, which means Joseph in
English, has learned to speak Eng-
lish, amazingly well, He also
participated in the annual Dapper
Dan boxing tournament last year,
entered walking. and cross-country
races,- received the Pittsburgh
YMCA’s Oscar for the young adult
of the year, holds the YMCA key
for leadership, and is president of
the Pittsburgh Cosmopolitan Club.

Baseball for Women

Ibrahim reports that cricket vies
with soccer as the leading sport
in India. “

Asked whether baseball is any-
thing like cricket, he replied, "No,
it's altogether different. In India
women play baseball.”

Yussuff will remain in the United
States until 1952. Then he will
leave for England to continue his
studies and to see soccer played
at its best. '

The Pharmacy Freshmen playing
with only fourmen could very easily
have made an interesting contest
with league-leading Psi Omega in
the Professional League if another

As it turned out the Pharmacy

game, 42-33. Charles Knauss made
quite a difference forthe Pharmacy.
He notched 21 markers to top any
point threat by Psi Omega Don
Wickerham with 13 tallies and El-

Forty-one Spent at Pitt

By LOIS FOIGHT

Next to the buildings on Pitt's growing campus, probably the
green of the grass on the 28 acres comes nearest to making it one
of the best knownbeauty spots of Pittsburgh-—and giving students
an added reason to be proud of their school.

But the little known man responsible for this spectacle appre-

To Act On

Suggestions

‘WSGA Commission's executive
committee will bring back Commis-
sion’s recommendations today, made
at their monthly meeting, for final
decision.

Wednesday evening WSGA Com-
mission made the recommendation
to inaugurate an "Education for
Election” program as an integral
part of campus activities to “stim-
ulate enthusiasm in women's elec-
tions.”

The recommendation was coupled
with the further suggestion to set
up an education-for-election com-
mittee from Commission to plan and
execute the program.

This joint action came as a re-
sult oflast month’s recommendation
to move the publication ,,of women
nominees’ names from one day be-
fore election to less than a week
before.

The ideas presented for the pro-
gram were varied, but the main pur-
pose was to have moreiwomen vote
as a result of more publieity about
about elections.

Some of the suggestions for the
program included an inter-election
sing which would constitute skits
put on by the various classes or
organizationsdepicting some Phase
of elections. A further idea was of-
fered to award a prize to the best
skit. _

At the close of the meeting, Com-

ciates it most of all. He is Gus-
tave H. Bentz, former foreman of
the Buildings and Grounds Depart-
ment, who sowed all of the seed
that went into making the lawn.

80 Years Old

“Gus,” who celebrated his 80th
birthday last fall, will have worked
at Pitt 41 years this spring.

"It's a shame,” he said, when
asked about the effect of the build-
ing program on the lawn. This is
the most beautiful place in Pitts-
burgh.”

Before the cathedral was "built,
he worked with the landscaping on
the upper campus.

Few students have ever seen
Gus, vrho usually works here from
5:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m., and has fin-
ished about the time most of them
are griping about getting up.

Still‘Lively

Qus is a wiry man, slightly
stooped, with _thin white hair and
mustache. His face is lined, but
he’s alert and eagle-eyed behind
his thin gold-framed glasses. His
bright, mischevious grin would do
credit to a small boy.

Though he has lived in Pitts-
burgh all his life, Gus boasts of
having been born on the Atlantic
Ocean when his parents were com-
ihg over from Germany. He really
grew up along with Pittsburgh.

He tells of walking from East
Liberty down town every day to
school “because that was faster
than the streetcars.” The cars were
horse drawn, then. He still scorns
streetcars, taking long walks around
Oakland during the afternoons.

Followed Fathers Footsteps
A member of a family of 18, Gus
started working at 14,following his
father's profession of landscaping.
"We had to work hard then," he

‘Gus can remember cows grazing
on the land where he later spent
five years putting in Pitt’s green
campus. He is as much a part of
Pitt as are the buildings and lawn.

“He's a grand old man,” accord-
ing to his fellow workers, who joke
with and tease him constantly. In
looking back, Gus is satisfied with
his life.

“I’ve enjoyed every bit of it,”
he remarked happily.’“To be happy

Dr. Herold C. Hunt, general superintendent of Chicago's public ~
school system, speaking before a group of tri-state school admin-
istrators at Pitt recently, said that by 1999, public schools-will
be organized to include what is now the first two years of college.

“Formal education f-or the average American will begin at age
three,” he added.

After complimenting the Univer-
sity’s education department for its
work in public service, the famed‘
educator went on to say that the
primary aim of America's teaching
system is to, “Promote the fullest
developementoftheindividual with-
in the framework of democratic
society.”

Also in regard to his lecture
topic, “Purposes of education in
American democracy,” he admitted
that the ultimate goals are too fluid
to be clearly defined, but suggested
that, “They must provide everyone
with the incentive to continue
learning.”

in education during the past 50
years and the $10 billion school
