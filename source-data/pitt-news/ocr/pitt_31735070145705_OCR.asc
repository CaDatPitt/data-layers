Englishigrads lose formal ceremony

Departmentalgraduation ceremony faces planning obstacles of marathon, final exams

For The Pitt News

Meghan Chambers spent the past
four years working hard to graduate
as a writing major on May 2 e- but
she will not attend the English De-
partment ceremony. - .

Chambers is one of about 270 stu-
dents who will graduate from the
English Department this spring.

“It seems kind of lame, honestly,”
Chambers said.

The Department of English and
Film Studies’ commencement was

initially scheduled to be held in the '

Connolly Ballroom of Alumni Hall

from 9 a.m until 11:30 a.m. — the

same arrangements the department
has made for many years in the past.
This year, after already having se-

cured the room, Pitt’s Event Plan-

department to move its ceremony
to the day prior because of a conﬂict

Peer health educators promote
stress management for finals  

Mallory Grossman
For The Pitt News

With the end of the semester fast
approaching, students are likely
to feel an increase in stress over-
load. 1
Around ﬁnals time, Panther-
WELL peer health educators, un-
dergraduate students who have an
interest in promoting health and
wellness to other Pitt students,
said they see an increase in the
amount of. stressed students.
The most common causes for
stress — aside from exams -—
include homework, jobs, money,
family, alcohol and drug issues,
signiﬁcant others, sex and safety,
PantherWELL peer health educa-
tor Kourtney Heichel said in an

‘e-mail. Poor time management

skills can also add to pre-existing
stresses, she said, because they
keep people from accomplishing
the maximum number of goals.

The stress that builds up isn’t
just frustrating. Stress has been
linked to causing emotional,
physical and physiological strain,
she said.

“As college students, any of
these strains can act as barriers
as we move towards our future
goals,” Heichel said. '

Some potential indicators of
stress, according to the Ameri-
can Institute of Stress website,

include muscle pain, insomnia, ’

headaches, irritability and anxi-
ety.

However, there are multiple
ways students can prevent and
control stress both on campus.

The University Counseling

Center runs the Stress Free Zone, ‘

which is located on the ground
floor of the William Pitt Union
and has regular business hours
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday
through Friday. 1

The Counseling Center holds-

stress relieving programs such
as chair massages, board games,
crafts, jewelry making, yoga and
breathing and stretching exercise
sessions, said Caroline Seaback,
an intern at the Counseling Cen-

' ter. There are also seasonal ac-

tivities, such as St. Patrick’s Day
hat decorating and Halloween
pumpkin painting.

Seaback, a senior majoring
in psychology, said a lot of stu-
dents take advantage of the Stress
Free Zone but that the number
depends on the day. When there

Students,facuIty cope with bus changes

Erin Block
Staffwriter

A little more than two weeks after
the PortAuthority implemented new
route changes, the bus schedule stand
in the Union is sparse.

_Erin Rodriguez, a Pitt student
who works at the William Pitt Union
information desk, said people ask
for copies of the handheld schedule
at least3 or4times ashiﬁ:— and a
shift is about four hours.

She doesn’t use the buses herself,
but knew the Port Authority intro-
duced changes on April 4.

“People have been asking about
the [bus schedule] stand since thebe-
ginning of April,” Rodriguez said.

Although the Union’s stand is

empty, some students and faculty .

say the.Port Authority didn’t notify
Oakland residents well enough, and
some say the changes are just an in-
convenience. However, Port Author-
ity says they promoted it for months,
and when the changes are done, itwill

V mean more options —— not fewer.

Port Authority issued new sched-

ules in February, Port Authority
spokeswoman Heather Pharo said.
The new schedules, which include
changes to popular routes for stu-
dents such as the 28X Airport Flyer,
61D and the 59U, are part of a seven-
phase plan to revamp the Port Au-
thority transportation system.

Jim Ritchie, another spokesman .

for Port Authority, said that after
the seven phases of the project are
complete, there will be a 6 percent
increase in transportation coverage.
The organization is preparing to an-
nounce a new set of changes injune
and September.

Pharo said Port Authority’s plans
won’t be complete for a couple of
years and that the timing depends
on the amount of funding the Port
Authority receives over the next year
or so.

“The overview of the plan is about
more thanjust changing bus routes

and changing the name of routes,” H

Pharo said. “It’s about creating a
much more modern system that
is part of the transit development
plan.” V A

She said she couldn’t release any

of the upcoming changes because not
all the plans for the future are com-
plete, but Pharo did say a new route
between Lawrenceville and Oakland
would be introduced during thejune
or September changes. ‘
Even though the Port Authority
hopes the new changes will beneﬁt
riders, some students and faculty are
uncertain about the adjustments.
Prior to April 4, English professor
Shalini Puri took the 61D bus route
once aweek from her home in Squir-

' rel Hill to her ofﬁce in Oakland. Her

ride took around a half hour includ-
ing a ﬁve-minute walk to and from
the bus stop. A V

“It’s free [to ride the bus] and it
eliminates looking for parking. It
reduces trafﬁc on Oakland, and it
reduces my carbon-footprint,” she
said. '

Puri’s original stop in Squirrel Hill
moved to Murray Avenue, a stop now
a 20-minute walk away.

She’s worried she will be forced
to drive everyday and that if the Port
Authority_continues to thin out the
service, fewer people will use it.

Ritchie, however, said the changes

would only mean a greater number of '

buses throughout the area.
“Squirrel Hill will end up having
the some of the best service in the
city,” he said, “In the end there will be
a rapid bus line that will run through
that [the Squirrel Hill to Oakland]

' corridor. A bus would run every two

or three minutes. Service would run
20‘ hours a day.”

Ritchie is not sure if the rapid bus
line will be implemented in the end
or beginning of next year.

Pitt student Bethany Ground
wondered how the shortened 28X
route would affect people in Robin-
son. The G2, which services the West
Busway, now services the Robinson
area and they should have a similar
ride time. ‘

Ground ‘said she thought the

routes between Downtown, Oak-g

land and the East _End worked well

before the route changes and the Port
Authority should add more access

into the city from the outskirts of
Pittsburgh.

“They should be focusing on
routes outside the city,” she said,
“instead of doing whatever they’re

1 doing now.”

“A

Pharo said besides creating a

- more efﬁcient route inside Pitts-

burgh, many of the new changes in-
cluded new routes that create better
access to places like Valley Quarter,
McKeesport, the Ohio River Valley
area and other places just outside
the city. ‘

Kira Ripper, a Pitt student and

4 West Miﬂlin commuter, uses her car

to get to and from school.
“I don’t usually use the buses, so it
doesn’t really matter,” she said.
Ripper said she heard about the
route changes, but because she drives

everywhere, she didn’t feel the need

to lookfurther into it.

She said,- “It doesn’t seem like a
big deal to me.”

Students Kerry Hancuch and
Jason Billington _also said they were
unaffected by the changes. .

Hancuch takes the bus twice a
week to go to the grocery store in
Squirrel Hill or run errands.

“I never asked for the bus sched- ~

ule pamphlets because the buses I
take frequently haven’t changed,”
she said, “but’I heard the bus to the

“We want to reach out so that-everyone has

that comes from being aware [of the detours

‘ formation on road closures is available online

Themost difficult closure for students at-
tending the commencement will be the Fifth

, “Ultimately, I think the Counseling Cen-
ter does help with students’ stress,” Sea-
back said. “There is a misconception that
the activities are juvenile. But the funny
thing is that most of the activities don’t
require any brain power. It’s just something
to keep your, mind off the stresses from
homework, family and friends.”

Because most students have jam-packed
schedules at the end of the semester, He-
ichel suggested individual stress relievers
that students can do on their own time.
In addition to improving time manage-
ment skills, students can use a variety of
relaxation methods, Heichel said. Some
methods include deep breathing and pro-
gressive muscle relaxation, which involves
tensing and relaxing the body muscles
from head to toe. The technique can al-
leviate ailments like headaches and stiff
necks. . '

Additionally, students can manage their
stress by getting adequate sleep, eating
healthy meals, staying physically active

and studying in advance for exams, He-

ichel said.

Peer health educators said some stu-
dents resort to negative stress reducers.
Cramming for an exam, not getting enough
sleep, skipping meals, eating unhealthy
food and turning to drugs and alcohol
are all ineffective ways of dealing with
stress.

The Student Health website offers tips
to cope with stress during ﬁnals time. Some

tips include using a planner to organize  I

test dates and study hours, minimizing
interruptions, practicing daily relaxation,
getting at least six hours of sleep, thinking
positively, getting regular exercise and

‘knowing when to seek help.

The Student‘Health website also has
a 10—question stress assessment so that
students can ﬁnd out how stressed they
really are. The questions can help students

help manage stress

ﬁgure out if their stress level is considered
high, moderate or low. Student Health
suggests that students with high stress
levels schedule an appointment with the
Counseling Center or visit the Ofﬁce of
Health Education & Promotion.

Reaction to activists rash, ignorant

dents foraDemocratic Society re-

moval ofis sponsorship from the
Pittsburgh Freedom School, a regional
conference about civil disobedience,
people were'I‘weetingand posting on
Facebook that they were “starting to
get chills.”

Some said anarchists were “in-
ﬁltrating” Pitt’s campus. Others said
studens “hoodwinked” the Univer-
sity, because some of the conference’s
evens were scheduled to occur inthe
Cathedral of‘Learning, the William Pitt
Union and David Lawrence Hall.

The group, by deﬁnition, seeks to
foster a discussion of different, often
radical political opinions. Although
some members of the group identify
themselves as anarchists — a term
that does not imply violence — at-
tempting to classify every person in
this group as the same shows either a

lack of understanding, or even worse,
a lack of care to establish one.
Although the group is philosophi-
cally against aleadership structure, is
listed president isjordan Romanus
for SORC record—keeping purposes.
Romanus said the group felt as though
an administrator pressured them to
cancel the event. Director of Student
Life KenyonBonner saidthathe spoke

I n the hours surrounding the Stu-

to the group, but did not pressure
them.

Either way, it was evident that
members of the Pitt community
were expressing sentiment against
the group before is conference even
started.

But if an academic community isn’t
the right place forpeople to openlydis-
cuss controversial issues, where is?

The itinerary for the Pitsburgh
Freedom School, which was named
in honor of the non-violent ﬁ'eedom
schools thatbegan in the Civil Righs
Era, consiss largely of caucuses. Con-
ference attendees planned to meet on
theﬁﬂhﬂoor ofthewilliam PittUnion
last week to discuss “anti—oppression
practice, conﬂict resolution, consent
and emotional support,” accordingto
the conference’s itinerary. Last Satur-
day, they had plannedto usethe Union
to discuss “campaign strategy, direct
action, making demands” and other
issues.

Their training session — which
seemed to have caused much of the
controversy —— was scheduled to take
place in Schenley Plaza and was de-
signed to teach people howto practice
civil disobedience “including aﬁin-
ity groups, blockades, lock-downs,
street marches, dealing with police

and building occupation.”

Pitt law professorArthur Hellman
said that Pitt can restrict activities
done with its resources beyond what
would be deﬁnedin criminallaws. The
University can say it doesn’t want is
facilities used for a particular reason,
but it can’t say it in a way that would
discriminate againsta group, Hellman
said. Pitt officials, who say they did
keep an eye on the event’s planning,
clearly did notsee enough of aproblem
to formally prevent the group from
meeting. g

Blocking the strees or disrupting
the ﬂow of traffic is not protected un-
der the First Amendment, and it is un-
clear whether these trainingsessions
would be protected, Hellman said.

“What the Supreme Court has said
is that government cannot prohibit
advocacy of illegal activity unless the
advocacyisboth directed to and incit-
ing immediate, unlawﬁil activity and
is likely to lead to it. There’s an imme-
diacy requirement that in some ways
doesn’tﬁtvery wellwith certain kinds
of teaching activities,” he said.

SDS says that they do not advocate
for orteach any illegal tactics, thatthey
ﬁnd vmys to do itallwithinthe bounds
of the law.

ful, and it ended when police asked the

though SDS members were involved,
it’s unfair to assume that the actual
SDS chapteragreeswith their actions,
regardless of the cause.

The enﬂre point of SDS, remember,
is to create an unstructured and open
forumfor people of differing opinions.
Ifany one member of the group does
something, it doesn’t mean that the
entire group supports it. This isn’tvery
different than if a baseball player, for
example, were to do something illegal.
Does that mean the entire baseball
team supports the 

Whereistheharminallowingthese
studens and their guess -— who are
allowedtopanicipateinthe conference
and use University resources, accord-
ingto Pitfs policy——to merely discuss
methods of civil disobedience?

The purpose of this editorial is not
to agree or disagree with the groups
platform, but rather to ask, “Since
when does a college communityﬁpwn
upon civil disobedience simply be-
cause its civil disobedience?” To argue
againstthose tactics would beto argue

against actions that helped shape our
country into what it is today.

Academia has historically been a
haven for open, diflicult discussion.
Ideas that, atthe time, sounded radical
and absurd to many are now Consti-
tutional Amendments thanks in large
to people not being afraid to debate
these issues on campuses across the
country. ,

In the 1960s and ’7os, protesters
used civil disobedience to protest the
Vietnam War and to ﬁght for equal
righs forwomen and minorities. The
ideas that theseprotesters espoused
—— thatthe Vietnam Warwas wrong
or thatwomen and minorities deserve
the same righs as white men — are
now common in today’s society. But
they might nothave been ifthe protest-
ers hadn’tbeen ableto draw attention
to them using non—violent methods.

But we must ask: Who are we, as a
Pitt community, to limit this group’s
ability to discuss non—violence?

Evens like the G—2o Summit have
made our community afraid of contro-
versy. Inresponse to people whothink
differently or more radically than us,
we shut down, fearingthatwewilllose
control over a situation. And that, we
fear, has shut down our ability to think
critically.

llutting audiences up to ‘The Task’  

Quantum Theatre’s latest production takes audiences on an avant—garde theatrical journey — literally

Sierra Starks
Senior Staff Writer

From the outside of the Strip
District’s Gage Building, a non-
descript gray—brown building,
there’s no indication that a the-
atrical work of art is set to take
place within its walls.

Inside this building the peeled
moss-green and beige paint,
creaking ﬂoorboards and ancient
radiators don’t appear to be what
German playwright Heiner Miil—
ler had in mind as the stage for
his play “The Task.”

But when Karla Boos saw the
space, she saw inﬁnite potential.
She saw the perfect space to host
“the theater of the revolution.”

“The building felt like an East
German factory of the mid-20th
century,” she said of the post-
industrial space.

As artistic director of com-
pany Quantum Theatre, Boos

PREVIEW

had been all around Pittsburgh
looking for the perfect stage. “I
felt this was the best space to
communicate the journey of the
piece,” she said.

This journey that “The Task”
takes the audience on occurs
in six different locations all set
on the second ﬂoor of the Gage
Building. The first scene is set in
the loading dock, and as the play
progresses, the audience moves
along with the action through the
entire floor until the play’s end.

Jed Allen Harris, a CMU the-
ater professor and director of
“The Task,” calls this walking
journey “the experience.”

And just as ,it will be an ex-
perience to all who attend “The
Task’s” showings, it was an expe-
rience to produce such a compli-
cated work of art.

Upon receiving the “difficult
and dense” script from Boos,
Harris admitted he had no idea
what he’d do with the play. He

‘The Task’ takes a classical work of theater and expands it to a six-room performance in a Strip District

building.

Southern rock concert far from Anchored

Larissa Gula
Staﬂ" Writer

The band Anchored markets itself
as a band that plays “dirty Southern
modern rock,” but the newly formed
ﬁve—person band doesn’t feel that’s
the best way to describe its music.

“It’s Southern pop rock, pretty
much,” singer Brandan Narrell said.
“They put dirty in because of the
ﬁrst single [titled “Dirty in Texas”] .
But it’s a clean record with no swear-
ing. It’s about happy and kind of chill
songs where you could be on aboat
ﬁshing or in a clu .”

Anchored is Southern-oriented
in many ways, according to N ar-
rell. The band formed in Texas
nine months ago, gaining support

through radio shows before begin-
ning its ﬁrst tour.

The band will perform at the Al-
tar Bar along with the groups Saliva,
October and Bishop Clay as part of
its kick~off tour.

But Dallas, where the crowds

were especially fun, had plenty to
offer the band, Narrell said.

“It’s always a wild show,” he said.
“All the bands around [Dallas] are
super hardworking and nice. With
some scenes you never know, but I
love all the guys and bands.”

As Anchored tours and brings its
music to other cities, the members
hope to discover welcoming mu-
sic scenes other than that of their
home-base city. The band brings

plenty of its personality on tour to b

welcome new fans.

“At some shows we do a Texas
BBQ so we can get closer to the
fans,” Narrell said, explaining he
hopes the band will have cookouts
and grill by the tour buses so that
fans can come speak directly to
them and “just have fun” getting to

ALBUM REVIEW T

No ‘Shame’

_ Kelsey Shea.
Assistant Aé-';E Editor

Sticking to the same sound is problematic
for bands, but for Dr. Dog, it works.

Its latest album, Shame, Shame, is
pretty much a repeat of its last few al-
bums Toothbrush,‘ Easy Beat and We All
Belong, but it’s far from a disappointing

audience’s awareness of what’s going on suffers
because of the editing. There are afew cool shots

here andthere + one ofjensen (Chris Evans) run-

ning across a concrete lot comes to mind — but
there’s nothing to write home about.

The performances are all ho—hum,i which
is particularly disappointing in the case of Zoe
Saldana, who was so vibrant in ‘itxvatari’ Here
she’s‘reduced to ‘a sex object, and she’s practi-
cally a clone of Thandie Newton circa “Mission
Impossible: 11.” Chris Evans is amusingly aloof,
butjason Patric’s Max is so over-the—top quirky
that he is instantly unlikable. V

Which brings me to the ﬁlm’s maindrawbacks:
the dialogue and the source material.

Now, I understand the need for authenticity

when adaptinga comic book, but the dialogue

in the ﬁlm feels like it was taken verbatim from
the pages. I don’tthinkthis shouldbe a jab atthe
comic book —— the screenwriters should under-

stilted on screen. «
This problem is no more evident than with

N ‘Max. His pseudo—ironic lines sound intentionally

forced and offlputting, but they never connect
with the viewer the way the ﬁlmmaker seems to
have intended. .

The same goes for the dialogue between The .
Losers. It’s reminiscent of a group of tenth grade
boys exchanging insults —— which again might
have been intentional irony — but it ultimately

, leaves the ﬁlmfeeling immature.

“The Losers” would have beneﬁted from an

Butas it is, “The Losers” should be described
like its characters. At best, check it out on late-

What was most meaningful to Harris

was conveying the theme of. exploration '

in the piece. Harris wanted the audience
to explore the scenes just as the charac-
ters do. In that purpose, one single stage
became six stages. He felt this was the
only way the audience would truly grasp
“the experience.” ‘

When asked to put the experience
into words, Harris said he’couldn’t. “The
experience can only be had through the
theatrical event,” he said. ‘

Boos explained that the play’s scenes
begin with “giant expanses” and ultimately
end with the audience inside. the heads of

For example, one of the beginning
scenes takes place with the audience look-
ing through a metal gate at the characters.
The audience then moves to either side of
a freight elevator to witness a scene taking
place inside. But the last two scenes are in
a more intimate space, where the actors
are an arm’s length away. V 7

Boos assures that in the ﬁnal scene,
“the experience will be complete.”

“It’s a surrounding, encompassing ex-
perience that I hope will be unforgettable,”
Boos said. '

That’s why we try to sell all of our merchandise

The band’s tour will also be the only place
to ﬁnd its new album for at least three more

band exists, according to Narrell.

“It just sort of happened,” Narrell said
about the band’s formation. “I wrote the whole
album about a year ago. The [other members]
came in after—the—fact. The band was created
because of the record.” .

And since he was composing and writing
it, Narrell’s life became the focus of “Listen

“I wrote the album based “off of life a

perform in a band, Advent, that sounded more
like Drowning Pool. 

Now that the album is composed and re-
corded, the band is on tour for the ﬁrst time.

NFL DRAI-'|'

to become the starter after Stull’s per-

formance the previous season and

in the Sun Bowl in particular, where

he was 7 for 24 with 51 yards and an
E interception.

Yet, just a little over seven months
 since that season opener, Stull has
‘ vastly improved and positioned him-
: selfas a possible late-round selection

in the NFL Draft starting today in
 New York.
1 The difference for Stull has been
q staggering, throwing for just nine
 T touchdowns and 10 interceptions his
§ junioryear, compared to 21 and eight
 respectively this past season.

1’ The biggest difference that led
=lt’o Stull’s improvement — besides
 zltireless work ethic — came when
 Pitt hired new offensive coordinator
 Frank Cignetti prior to last season.

“Coach Cignett1"s playing system

 1 ﬁt my playing style to a T,” Stull said.

i “I watched a lot of ﬁlm of my redshirt
 junior year and critiqued myselfto a
 point where I don’t make that same
 mistake again.”

5 Stull, one of the most criticized
 Pitt players in recent memory, said
 he feels that all the booing he’s heard
 over the course of two seasons at Pitt
 will only help himwhen it comes time
 to perform in the pressure-packed
 NFL.

 ii!‘ “I think that you’re not going to

 "ﬁnd a more mentally—tough quarter-
 back than me,” Stull said. “I’m pretty

 sure it’s safe to say I’ve gone through a

 lot of difficult times. No matter what
 people say about me I’m not going to

 back down.”

5 Sunseri, who watched Stull from
 the sidelines this year, agreed.

, “Anytime you face that kind of
 adversity, you’re not going to hit
 anything harder,” Sunseri said.

i “And me justbecominga goodfriend
 with him, you realize how much he
 went through and all he had to over-
; come.”

 Anotherthingthatwillhelp Stull’s
'11 chances of getting picked in the draft
:  his familiarity with an NFL system.

 Cipach Dave Wannstedt installed a

 pro-style offense when he took over
 before the 2005 season, Stull’s ﬁrstas

ii a Panther, and.Cignetti’s NFL back-

 ground only helped him more.

5 l L  “I thinkl might be one of the only
;f quarterbacks in this draft [who has]

been in a pro-style offense for ﬁve

years,” Stull said. “The learning curve
will be a little bit easier for me.”

But the thing that has helped
his chances the most was his recent
play on the ﬁeld. He completed 65.1
percent of his passes last year and
finished in 11th place in quarterback
ratings among all Division I quarter-
backs with 150.6.

There was certainly no one boo-
ing him at Pitt’s pro day last month
where he was equally effective, im-
pressing scouts with his 4.90 second
40-yard dash speed and reportedly
good arm strength and accuracy -4 a
trait that Sunseri feels is Stull’s best
physical attribute.

Not to mention his 6-foot-3 inch,
215 pound frame gives him the type
of solid build that NFL general man-
agers like.

Stull’s agents have told him that
with those pro day results and im-
proved stats from last season, he’s
put himself in a good position to
land himselfwith an NFL team this
summer.

“We’ll see what happens, just try-
ingnot to get my hopes up,” smll said.
“But [...] what I’m hearing is that I’ll
deﬁnitely get picked up whether it’s
as a free agent or getting drafted.”

But it’s tough to say exactly how
he will land with a team, as different
mock drafts have drastically differ-
ent ratings on him. ESPN has him
ranked as the No. 14 quarterback in
the draft, while CBS Sports has him
at No. 27.

He still has three classes left to
complete his communications degree
as his training regimen this winter in
Florida set him back.

But Stull said he’s in the process of
ﬁguring out when to complete those
classes, whether over the summer
or next fall.

So look for Stull to possibly get
his name called on Saturday — day
three of the draft —— which Stull will
be watching with his family at his
parents’ house.

As far as what the teams thinking
about picking up Stull should expect
to get from him, Sunseri gave a ring-
ing endorsement.

“They’re going to get a guy that
works hard, and they’re going to get
a guy that's allforthe team,” Sunseri
said. “The only thing he cares about

is winning.”

The Pitt women’s tennis team needed to
win two out of its last three matches to
advance to the Big East Championship.

With their 7-0 victory over Providence
and a 4-3 success at St.john’s, the Panthers
completed their goal before losing to Con-
necticut 5-2 in the third game of the New
England road trip.

With the victories, Pitt earned the No.
10-seed in the Championship and will take
on No. 7—seed Rutgers today at 9 a.m. in
South Bend, Ind.

“Our goal was to win two out of three,”
head coach George Dieffenbach said. “I
thought if we did that we stood a very good
chance of qualifying. We did it, and we’re
going into the Big East Championship with
momentum.”

Against Providence, the Panthers won
every match in doubles and singles/play.

Pitt’s next victory came in a close mateh

the win for the Panthers in the last singllas
match of the day. Her 7-6 (5), 5-7, 6-4 d3e—

tween Pitt and St. John’s.

The victory gave Dieffenbach 300 ch-
reer wins as the head coach of the Pitt
women’s tennis team. He has coached the

Panthers for 27 years. Dieffenbach gave a

most of the credit for his accomplishment
to Pitt’s current and former players. ‘

“The players won,” he said. ‘‘I didn’t

win any of the matches. I played a part, but
they were the ‘ones who got the victories
for Pitt, and they did a great job. It’s also
a credit to the outstanding University of
Pittsburgh athletics department.” g.

BURGOS AND FRIES ~

Thanks for the  
memories Panthers

Pitt News columnist says goodbye

Evan Burgos
Senior Staﬂ” Writer

 

‘re
5., It was sophomore year and as winter break
approached, I had yet to have an excuse to cel-

ebrate  to cheer  to feel like I was a fan.

‘ The night of Dec. 1, 2007, changed all
that. Pitt football was sputtering, despite a
 freshman tailback, LeSean McCoy, who
would rush the Panthers to a winning record
the following season. And although Pitt would
not play in a bowl game that year, it had the
chance to upend its most vaunted rival — a

our dorm, on University Drive C, there she
was. That beautiful sight, set ablaze in all her
glory — a ﬂaming, burning couch.

Soon enough we were down the hill, on
Forbes Avenue, witnessing the masses of Pitt
students who had ﬂooded the streets in cel-
ebration. Some were climbing light posts, oth-
ers were jumping on cars, some were breaking
windows. It was a riot.

So this is what college sports are like, I
thought. Finally, I had a reason.

Now, as I prepare to depart Pitt and The
Pitt News, Iﬁnd myselfrecalling all of the best,
most exciting times in Pitt athletics throughout
my tenure as a fan, er, journalist on campus.

After that December night,

excitement was never short

around Oakland.

West Virginia team on the precipice of clinch-
ing a spot in the BCS National Championship,
ranked No. 2 in the nation, sportingan impres-
sive 10-1 record — while playing at home, in
the latest edition of the Backyard Brawl.

That night, after coming into the game as
a four—touchdown underdog, the Panthers
miraculously defeated the Mountaineers
13-9 with hard-nosed defense and a staunch
running attack. I watched the game with my
three roommates in Pennsylvania Hall. When
the ﬁnal whistle blew, we were out the door
and on the street before you could say, “Pat
Bostick.”

And then, as we ran out the front door of

TOTALLY NUDE

After that December night, excitementwas
never short around Oakland.Just afew weeks
after the Backyard upset, Levance Fields pro-
vided my next greatest thrill when he hit a dra-
matic, game—winning, step -back, in—your—face
trey ball over Duke to win a gripping overtime
game in Madison Square Garden.

The team would laterwin the Big East tour-
nament at season’s end. It was then that I fell
in love with Pitt basketball.

A year later, we’d have Dejuan Blair strut-
ting around campus. Sam Young had emerged
as a big—time college baller, and Fields, well
— Fields has to be considered one of the great
college point guards of the past four years,
