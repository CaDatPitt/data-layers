The Mountaineers. arrived V here
fresh from a ‘victorious Southern trip,

V1but_._w'eVre hariiieda big surprise p'ack-$ .‘

ago in the -person of “Eddie” Lang-
don, our port side hurler.‘ “Eddie”
has proved that he is the goods and
had t,he1 Morgantown batters literally
breaking,Vtheir backs to hit his assort-

ment of fast, slow, crooked and

straight ones. Not only in the box
did he perform well, but at the ba. he
corraled three andy” tiiiiely“‘l11its.

co1*or‘,Vailthoug,h, not to any great ex-

iterit.‘ The only real mistake he made 

came in the seventh inning when
Ammons overslid third basjeg. He got.

back to‘ the bag in "safety, but the

West Virginia third baseman claimed
_th_V’aVVt1 the Pitt coacher had touched the
runner and was therefore legally out.

however. :It would not have made

any  change in the victory, how- ’

The big ‘crowd was treated to some
