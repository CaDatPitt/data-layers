Closing down

The Pitt Tavern shuts its doors

By Jill Carell

Staff Writer .

The Pitt Tavern is closing its
doors today — for good.

After 41 years in business, the
Pitt Tavern at the corner of Bou—
quet Street and Fifth Avenue has
been sold to the University of
Pittsburgh. The university will
replace the tavern with dormi-
tories.

”My wife and sister and I have
worked hard, and we are getting
old. We are not kids anymore;
we want to retire,” said John
Boles, 66, co-Owner of the tavern.

Christine and Geraldine Boles
bought the tavern in November
1945. John Boles joined them six
months later when he was dis-
charged from the Army Air Force.

Geraldine Boles died in 1975.

”l_t was called the Pitt Tavern
when we bought it. It was a busi-
ness place, and it had a famous
dining room upstairs,” said John
Boles. ”Now there are ‘apart-
ments upstairs.”

The Boles have been consider-
ing the sale for about four years.

”They [the university] never
pressured us into selling. They
said, ’When you are going to sell,
give us the first shot at it,’ ” said
John Boles. ”We’ve been discuss-
ing it on andoff for about four
years.” .

Boles made his decision to sell
the tavern three months ago.
. The clientele at the Pitt Tavern
differed from that of other Oak-
land bars. Their crowd tended to
be older than the others.

”We get a lot of people in visit-
i_ng the hospi.tals,”said Boles,
”but mostly graduate students.”

In its 41 years of business, the

. Pitt Tavern never had a citation.

”We never had a problem with
minors. If they weren't old
enough, they wouldn't. get
served,” he said.

The quiet” atmosphete of the
tavern‘ allowed it to host activities
which are not usually seen in the
other Oakland bars. Both the law
‘school and sociology classes held
lectures and class discussions
there. Poetry readings also took
place there. _

Boles said he has a lot of mixed
emotions about selling the tavern.
”We loved the area and the peo-
ple we dealt with,” he said. ”l’m
going to miss them.”

Administration,  
United Faculty    

reach agreement a 

By Kathy Stahl

News Editor
An agreement has been
reached between the United

‘Faculty and Pitt's administration
on a stipulation citing the role of
the faculty at the university.

The purpose of the stipulation
is to hasten a legal decision con-
cerning the. United Faculty’s
proposal for a collective bargain-
ing election to be held.

The stipulation was formally
accepted on Nov. 12, by the
Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board hearing examiner, Elliot
Newman.

Because both sides were able
to agree on the stipulation, no
more public hearings will be
needed.

”What is now trying to be
decided is whether or not Pitt's
faculty function as managers,"
said Newman.

The answer to this will deter-
mine whether the faculty may
hold a collective bargaining
election. _

Pitt's administration said they
cannot. They based their decision
on the 1980 Supreme Court de-
cision in the National Labor Re-

-  r’ ~

 

Iations Board vs. Yeshiva
University case. The court ruled
that full-time faculty at Yeshiva
University in New York were not
allowed to unionize because it
served, in many instances,
managerial rather than employee
functions.

Pitt administration said that the
faculty here also serves in
managerial functions; therefore,
they are not entitled to a collec-
tive bargaining unit.

In the stipulation both the Unit-
ed Faculty and the administration
agree that ’”at least since the
19505, tenured, tenure-stream
and full—time, non-tenure-stream
faculty of Pitt have shared in the
governance of the institution in a
fashion comparable to those"
faculties found to be managerial
under the principles of NLRB vs.
Yeshiva University.”

”The law is clear under feder-
al law,” said Lewis Popper, legal

"counsel for the university. ”But

under state law it's not so clear.”

In reply to the administration,
the United Faculty said that such
sharing in the governance of the‘
university does not confer

' managerial statuson them, thus

Nicaraguan court sentences Hasenfus to 30 years

MANAGUA, Nicaragua ——
Downed American flyer Eugene

‘ Hasenfus was sentenced Saturday

to 30 years in prison by a ”Peo-
ples’ Tribunal” for his role in
shipping supplies to the. Contras.

Hasenfus was captured by the
Sandinista government of Presi-
dent Daniel Ortega after‘ his
plane, which contained supplies
destined for the Contra rebels
fighting the pro-Soviet Ortega
government, was shot down.

President Reagan has charged
that the so-called Peoples’
Tribunal is a ”Kangaroo Court"
and did not give Hasenfus a fair
trial.

Nicaraguan vice president Ser-
gio Ramirez said Sunday that
Hasenfus might be pardoned as
a sign ofgood will. Ramirez
made the remarks at a press con-
ference_in Atlanta.

Back ‘in Nicaragua, however,
the justice minister said, ”There
is no good reason for Hasenfus to
be pardoned."

Hasenfus’ sister, Sandy Cop-
pens, said Sunday she does not
expect him to be released soon.
Coppens said her family will tie

red, white and blue ribbons
around trees to keep her brother's
situation on the minds of
Americans.

Unfit pilots may be
flying

PITTSBURGH —- A copyright-
ed story in Sunday's edition of
The Pittsburgh Press charges an
air crash may soon result from the
Federal Aviation Administration's
top surgeon's decision to let more
than 250 Vpilotsand co-pilots who
were grounded because of med-
ical problems fly.

The story quotes many doctors
as saying Frank Austin has al-
lowed the grounded pilots and
co-pilots to fly over the objections
of medical experts.

The doctors called Austin's ac-
tions dangerous and reckless and
said he posed a serious threat to
safety that may endanger the’ lives
of thousands.

But Austin, who is the final

. authority in virtually all appeals

of medical decisions made by the
FAA’s 7,000 medical examiners,
said he would rather use his own

Sinatra goes home,
Layne is critical

LUBBOCK, Texas — Legen-

home from a California hospital
Sunday a spokesman reported.

Sinatra had undergone surgery
to remove a section of his large
intestine.

The spokesman said Sinatra
will be recuperating at home for
an indefinite period and did not
know when he would return to
the stage.

Also Sunday, hall of famer Bob-
by Layne was in critical condition
in a Lubbock hospital following

surgery to stop hemorrhaginglin
his lower esophagus.

Last week Layne spent some
time in a Michigan hospital after
experiencing liver trouble.

Layne entered pro football in
1967 and starred as quarterback
for,the Detroit Lions, but he also
had stints with the Pittsburgh
Steelers and Chicago Bears.

Layne’s wife said he became ill
Saturday night and drove himself

of good will toward Iran to help
improve relations of the two
countries.

Critics have claimed the move
amounted to paying ransom de-
mands to the kidnappers -
something President Reagan has
vehemently said he would never
do. According to the critics, such
a move will only encourage more
terrorist acts against U.S. citizens.

Reagan also has criticized the

Tutu’s daughter speaks at Pitt

By Jill Carell

Staff Writer

Naomi Tutu—Seavers, anti-
apartheid activist and daughter of
Nobel laureate Bishop Desmond
Tutu, urged Pitt students to con-
tinue applying pressure on Pitt
companies to dives_t from South
Africa.

”We need the people of this
country to speak out,” pleaded
Tutu—Seavers. The anti—apartheid
activist spoke at Pitt ‘on Tuesday
as part of the Black Action Socie-
ty’s Black Week celebration.

Tutu—Seavers has been involved
in anti-apartheid solidarity work
in the United States since 1978.
Besides educating the public
about the South African situation,

We would benefit from an increased activities fee 

By‘ Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer

Each term, students find on
their invoices a student activities
fee. A fair number of students, es-
pecially freshmen, wonder where
the money goes.

The money is divided among
the SGB, the Pitt Program Coun-
cil and the media board, with the
largest portion (50 percent) going
to the SGB. The SGB uses the
funds for its own operation and
for allocation to the various stu-
dent organizations. .

Nearly every year, the budget
requests from the organizations
are far in excess of the available

Seavers, founded the Bishop Tutu
Refugee Fund in Hartford, Conn.
This non—profit organization as-
sists more than 50,000 South Afri-
can refugees in meeting their
medical, clothing and education-
al needs. A

”The forgotten victims of apart-
heid, they are apartheid’s refu-
gees,” Tutu—Seavers said in
reference to the at least 30,000
refugees who have fled South
Africa.

Most of the refugees,» aged
18-25, were forced to flee their

June 1976 Sowetto uprising.

.They are now living in im-

poverished asylum countries
such as Botswana, Swaziland and

funds. If the quality of the student
organizations at Pitt is to continue
to grow, something must be

done.
In .the _campaign debates be-

tween this year's SGB presiden-
tial canidates, a fair amount of
attention was devoted to discus-
sion of the merits of an increase
in the fee. Both candidates sup-
ported the increase, differing only
in the amount propsed.

Last year, the funds available

totaled $174,523, and the budg-

et requests totaled $406,289.
Each group submits a request
before the beginning of the term,

will need for the year and how

”As political violence in South
Africa continues and the govern-
ment increases its clampdown on
student, church and labor ac-
tivists, the number of refugees
steadily rises,” said Tutu—Seavers.

These asylum countries for

South Africa have trouble meet-
.ing the basic needs of their own
citizens and depend on interna-
tional assistance for food, hous-
ing and education. With the
growing number of refugees in
their countries, it is difficult to
share scarce resources.

”But this is only part of the cost
of granting asylum to apartheid
victims,” said Tutu—Seavers. ”The

that money will be spent.

The requests are then reviewed
by the allocations committee,
which either approves or denies
each request according to stipu-
lations printed in the SGB alloca-
tions handbook. ‘

The handbook outlines the
type of activities the SGB will
fund. A fair portion of the deni-
als are for events described as in-
eligible in the guidelines.

Anti-apartheid activist, Naomi Tutu-S,eave_rs.

The need for more money in
the activity fee is apparent. Each
year, inflation decreases the
spending power of the groups,
and the allocations cannot keep
up with the increase in demand.

An increase of 50 percent in
the fee would not be an over-
whelming burden to the students
and would give theallocations
committee a substantialy larger
sum to work with.

While the actual difference be-
tween the amount available and
the requests may be somewhat
misleading because some of the
requests are for activities that are
automatically denied, the de-

mand still out-distances the
supply.

Any increase in the activities
fee would. be translated into
benefits for the students. ‘

Let's cut the pose. The bottom
line is that there simply isn't
enough money available for the
activities.

An increase, even a doubling,
of the activities fee, isn't going to
hurt anyone. We all stand to gain

' a lot from any increase.

R There are nearly constant com-
plaints that the students at Pitt are
apathetic. Better activities could
be a positive step in the direction
of change.

THE PITI NEWS, Monday, November I7, 1986

The answer to the nation's
deficit and to balancing the budg-
et is so simple. All of America's
economic woes could be turned
around virtually overnight.

Here's the answer: permit cor-
porations to advertise on dollar
bills. Notjust $1 bills. Fives, 10s,
20s, 100s — open them all up to
commercial advertisers.

One side of the bill would still
look like a traditional piece of
currency. But the other side
would contain a commercial
message from a. company wish-
ing to reach large numbers of
consumers.

To those of you who are al-

ready cringing at the notion of‘

this, may I point out that today is
not the first time the idea of ad-
vertising oncurrency has been
advanced. In the 19305 Seward

‘7’f'-‘/ Johnson, heir to the Johnson &

Johnson pharmaceutical fortune,
proposed a similar plan, but it got
nowhere.

Now, though, the time has‘

come for action. Economists are
alarmed about the state of the na-
tion’s fiscal health. Some predict
that there is no way to get Ameri—
ca's finances on an even keel
again.

But if the federal government
were to allow private industry to
advertise on the backs of dollar
bills and other paper currency,
the national coffers would be

swimming in profits. Think of"

how much corporations spend

for advertising on television and -

in newspapers and magazines.
Then think about how much it
would be worth for them to ad-
vertise on paper money.

It would be the most effective
means of advertising in the histo-
ry of commercial endeavors. You
can fall asleep during a television
show, or you can rapidly flip past
a page in the newspaper — but
you're always going to look at
your money. Advertising on the
back of‘ paper currency would be
direct, one-on—one communica-
tion that would bewithout pre-
cedent. .

Different advertisers would
choose different denominations
upon which to place their mes-
sages. Hamburger chains such as
McDonald's and Burger King, for
example, might choose to adver-
tise on the backs of $1 bills. Lux-
ury automobiles such as Mer-
cedees-Benz might choose to ad-
vertise on the backs of $100 bills.

Normally when I get an idea

    

.2

this good, I keep it to myself and

a try to market it. But I was so over-

whelmed by the benefits to the

"government that would come

from this plan that I called the
Department of the Treasury and
offered them this inspiration free
of charge.

The response was under-
whelming.

Art Siddon, a Treasury spokes-
man, put it succinctly: ”As far as
the current administration is con-
cerned, it will never be done.”

I was undaunted. I called the
office of U.S. Treasurer Katherine
D. Ortega and was connected
with her press secretary, Susanne
Howard. As briefly as I could, I

' BOB GREENE

outlined my wonderful plan.

There was a momentary
silence.

Then Howard said: ”I have
never heard about anything like
that. I have heard all kinds of
ideas about money, but I have
never heard anyone say that there
should be advertising on it.”

I told her that now she had
heard of it; I had just told her
about it. I asked her what she
thought the prospects might be
for advertising on the back of
paper money — did she think it
was feasible?

’’I can't imagine it,” she said.
”It would have to go through
Congress. Any change in curren-
cy as radical as that would be
something that we wouldn't just
put through ourselves. And I can't
see the Congress of the United
States approving commercial ad-
vertising on the back of U.S.
currency.”

But think of the revenues this
could bring into the government,

- I said.‘This could literally be the

nation's financial savior. I asked
her to consider it for a moment

not just as a government spokes- -

man, but as a private citizen.
”I just don't think so,” Howard
said. ”The thing to remember is

 Ads on U.S. currency could pay the deficit

that the integrity of the American
dollar-must be preserved. The
American dollar is truly interna-
tional currency, and people want
to have their green and black,

paper money. I don't think the . 1

average citizen would be in favor
of having advertising on the
backs of dollar bills and other
denominations. No — a thing like
this would not be good."

Susanne Howard and I said

goodbye, but I'm still not giving _

up. Something she said stuck

with me — that line about ”the '

intergrity of the American dollar
must be preserved.” .

She said it as if making money
commercial would somehow de-

file the money. But think about it - N

— what is more crass and com-
mercial than money? Money, by
definition, is commercial. So
what would be wrong with com-
mercializing it a little bit more?

People moaned and screamed-

when the Statue of Liberty was
parceled out to commercial spon-’
sors. But it happened, and we sur-
vived. Surely we can do the same
thing with money _— and help the
government at the same time. Let
the bidding from, the advertising
community begin.

to be serious about. There is one
man I consider having a relation-
ship with, because -he is nice and
I wouldn't mind, but he is shy
and maybe he couldn't handle a
romantic or sexual relationship.
Ifl tell him I love him, will that
jeopardize our friendship?
A. Yes, it might scare him
away. And, if you tell this nice,
shy man you love him, you will
be lying to him and using him for
a stopgap lover while you get on
with your career pursuits. So I
say, since you are a nice young
woman and don't want to hurt
anyone —— don't. You would be

endangering this friendship, and *

there is no reasonto do that. A
friend is something priceless, not

“to be used to relieve sexual or
emotional hunger.

Let this friendship go on
without sexual involvement. It
may last you a lifetime and prove
to be something very, very dear
to you. At some point, it may be-
come clear that this is the man
you want in your life, and any
problem he seems to have in han-
dling a sexual or emotional bond
with you now may be overcome.

But don't try to plunge into
something that you and he are so
uncertain about at this point. In
the future, it may be right for you
to make the first move and be the
one to say ”I love you,”-but not
now. You definitely should not
do itout of frustration.

At this time in your life a friend- -

ly, no-sex companionship with a

man may be just what you need..

-It can give you and him some-
thing you both want right now.
The fact that he is shy or cautious
orjnot ready for a big commit-
ment may make him just the guy
you need. 1

cause it seems to be what every-
body does, because there is a lot

. of fear nowadays about abstain-'

ing from sex, because friends and
suitors keep urging the idea that
being avirgin is dangerous be-
yond a certain point, like storing
in the
basement.

I always say no, not to go into
sexual activity until the young
woman or man is sure, sure in ev-

ery way, with no disturbing
doubts about being ready. You're
ready when your heart pounds,
and you can't wait to see him
again, and you are sure when
your mind is satisfied, and there
are no doubts about him or his

lifestyle or background or feelings

for you.

You say nothing about being a
virgin, but the same applies to
anybody who is considering a
new relationship cautiously or
considering a return to sexual ac-
tivity. Nobody, virgin or not, has
to consider being sexually active
a duty. There is nothing to the
idea that sexual inactivity harms
you in any way, not even for fu-
ture sexual activity.

Often I get letters from men
asking if there is a danger, in their
time of loneliness and of feeling
unable to connect with women,
that fantasies and self-gratification
will make life-long prisoners of
them.

I do not think so, nor do other
psycho-sexual therapists. Solitary

Continued from page 3
to hound its opponents even
when they have fled the country.

”The South African govern-
ment has, through economic, po-
litical and military actions,
continually attempted to coerce
neighboring states into denying
political asylum and humanitari-
an assistance to refugees of

' apartheid.”

Many of the asylum countries
are under pressure to expel South
African refugees. According to
Tutu-Seavers, hostile attacks and
threats of attack have created a
reign of tear among the refugees
of South Africa. _

”Truly they are the forgotten
victims of apartheid, for very lit-
tle is ever heard about them in
the outside world, and there are
few organizations working to
help them meet their needs or
protect their lives,” she said.

Tutu-Seavers attributes her spe-
cial concern for the refugees to
her upbringing. She was taught as
a child that only through respect-
ing other people can one earn
respect.

”Many people have made
numerous sacrifices throughout

‘ my life so that I might earn a good

education for a free South Afri-
ca,” she said. ’’I have been
privileged, and I was taught
privilege implies responsibility.”

While attending college, Tutu-
Seavers raised funds to send
books and supplies to Botswana.
This increased her determination
in helping others.

”Once apartheid is abolished,
the real struggle begins, the strug-
gle to build a non-racial,
democratic society,” said Tutu-
Seavers. She feels that refugees
can play an important role in this
reconstruction process if they
receive the necessary resources

to develop the urgently needed
economic and self-governing
skills.

”South African refugees must
become self-sufficient in order to
make economic contributions to
their respective countries of asy-
lum,” she said. ”Today’s refugees

are tomorrow's leaders. Refugees _

can play a vital role in building
a prosperous democratic society
in post—apartheid South Africa if
given the resources today to do
so.”

Tutu-Seavers believes that
South Africa can only become
this way with the help of the rest
of the world. '

”We ask that you let your out-
rage be known so that South Afri-
ca cannot attack refugees in
neighboring states with impuni-
ty or so threaten sovereign na-
tions that they are forced to expel
refugees,” she said.

While urging her listeners to do
all they can, she suggested that
individuals send letters, provide
financial support to South Africa
refugees, organize programs and
increase pressure on companies
thatdo business there.

Pitt begins study of 
black’s status in Pgh.

By Milt l<lopfer

”The studies in the past have

munity Services annouced at a
meeting in the William Pitt Un-
ion last Tuesday that the issues of
black youth, public health and
economic development will be
the targets of a new research
study.
The study, titled ”Status of the
Black Community in Pittsburgh,”
— is designed to gather data around
issues affecting the quality of life
of Pittsburgh blacks.
The data will be reviewed by
a special task force committee.
The committee will use the data
to devise an action plan and then
make policy recommendations
for the city to execute.
According to Project Director

Edward Meeks, this is the first

time a study of black issues will
include in its report specific sug-
gestions for policy-making and
plans of action. '

community, but this is the only
one with specific suggestions of
policies to deal with them.”

The Office of Urban and Com-
munity Services has addressed is-
sues affecting the Pittsburgh
community in the past. Its goal is
to help solve community
problems by linking experts from
the community with members of
the Pitt faculty who have ex-
perience in working with similar
problems. The office received a
grant from the city to perform the
study last May.

Perseverance   2

Panthers gut out 20-6 win over Rutgers

By John Enright
Sports Editor A

Early on in Pitt's 20-6 win over

the Rutgers Scarlet Knights at Pitt
Stadium before a sparse crowd of
34,922 on Saturday afternoon,
the Panthers appeared to be in
trouble. -

The Scarlet Knights, who had
scored the game's first points
midway through the first quarter
on a five-yard touchdown run by
Curtis Stephens, were moving at
will against the Pitt defense. The
Panthers’ ground game, led by
sophomore running back Craig
”lronhead” Heyward, was going
nowhere. '

With regular quarterback John,

Congemi out with a back injury,
Pitt was hoping to grind it out on
the ground against Rutgers and
abandon its run—and-shoot of-
fense because of the relative in-
experience of backup quarter-
backs Sal Genilla and Joe
Felitsky.

Rutgers stifled that plan and
more ‘particularly Heyward, who
couldn't find the holes to utilize
the stength and speed which he
used to.punish Miami the previ-
ous week.

The only choice now was to try V

the passing game with quarter-
back Joe Felitsky, who was mak-
ing the first start of his career in
place of the asthma-stricken
Genilla.

Felitsky was-shaky in the early

stages of the game, and when,

Genilla started to loosen up on

W the sidelines midway through the

second quarter, it appeared his
day's work would be cut short.

But Gottfried stuck with
Felitsky, and -with the added
boost of confidence, the junior
quarterback responded, leading
the Panthers on a 61-yard drive,
capped by an 18-yard touch-'
down pass to Billy Osborn. The
touchdown gave Pitt a 7-6 half-

time lead that they would never"

relinquish.

Pitt coach Mike Gottfried was
pleased with Felitsky’s play, but
more so with the efforts of every
player. ’’I'm very proud of the
way our players played,” said
Gottfried. ”We played under un-
fortunate circumstances/’.

Pitt certainly did. Besides Con-

Staff Writer

Pitt junior Joe Felitsky stepped
in at ‘quarterback for an injured
Sal Genilla Saturday afternoon
and got the Panthers back on the
winning track, leading the team
to a 20-6 win over Rutgers.

”Joe played very well,” said
Pitt coach Mike Gottfried. ”He
missed a couple of reads in the
first quarter, but -he got himself
back together and showed what

‘ he could do.”

 

Although he has seen action

the last two seasons, including’.-f

some playing time against Syra-
cuse two weeks ago, the game
against Rutgers was Felitsky’s first
start sincelhisgsenior year at Cen-
tral Catholic. "It really felt great
out there today,” said Felitsky. ’’It
was a dream come true."

In the beginning of the game,
Felitsky was playing more of a liv-
ing nightmare than a ”dream
come true” game. Felitsky’s first
couple attempts fell short of his
receivers, and it looked as if he

were nervous out on the field.’

Gottfried wasn't'pleased, to say
the least.

\ ”Coach Gottfried grabbed me‘

    

on the sidelines and let me know
how he felt," said Felitsky.‘ ”That
got my head back into the game.
Tom Brown also helped by giv-
ing me some inspirational words
in the huddle. ‘Sol knew that I
had to put it together.”

When Felitsky was struggling,

- Gottfried had Genilla warming

up on the sidelines, but he never
seriously considered putting him
in. ’’I never really had a thought
of changing quarterbacks today,”
said Gottfried. ”l was only going
to use Sal as a last resort.

 

’’I know what Joe can do, and

he showed it today. A couple of '

times people got in his face, but
he kept his composure out there.

He made things happen out there . 

today."
Midway through the second

quarter, Felitsky still seemed to be  V

struggling. But with 5:26 left in
the half, Pitt linebacker Darrell
Woods intercepted a pass oh the
Panthers’ own 39-yard line. Now,

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 17, 1986

Bradley a ’special’ player for footballteam I

By Rick Fellinger
Staff Writer

Matt Bradley is a misplaced
linebacker.

Well, not quite.

He has found a home this sea-
son on Mike Gottfried’s special
teams, where he has not only
been playing regularly, but also
solidly. Bradley is one of those
unsung_ Panthers who doesn't
have Bill Hillgrove or Myron
Cope pounding down his door
for interviews, but he still puts on
his hard hat and laces up his
workboots everyday and treks off
to his job on special teams with
his lunch pail in his hand.

Probably the biggest influence
Bradley has had on a game this
year was in South Bend, Ind.,
when he blocked a punt in Pit_t’s
l0—9 win over Notre Dame.

Bradley called the blocked
punt ”the most exciting thing I
did all year.” He said that heand
fellow special team members
James Turner and Reggie Smith

‘ took advantage of a three on two

situation against the Irish offen-
sive line, and Bradley broke
through to swat the punt to the
turf.
' Originally, Bradley was a
weak-side reserve linebacker, but
he has since been moved into the
middle linebacker slot where he

backs up starter Jerry Olsavsky
and spends downs one through
three watching -from the sidelines.
However, Bradley's not upset
about his lack of playing time at
the linebacker spot. ”You try to
contribute the most you can, and
special teams is a way for me to
contribute,” said Bradley.
Coach Gottfried is happy with
Bradley's play on punts, kick-offs
and field goals. ”Matt has done
a good job ‘for us on special

’ teams,” said Gottfried. ”He has

played an active role there all
year.”

Pittsburgh isn't the only big-
time college where Bradley has
played football. In I984 he trans-
ferred to Pitt from UCLA because
of ”miscommunications” that
gave him some trouble getting
into the school of his choice,
which was the School of En-
gineering.

But Bradley doesn't hold any
grudges because of the mix-up
and said that he doesn't want to
shed any bad light on UCLA. ’’I
liked the coaching staff a lot, and
I have a lot of respect for the head
coach [Terry Donahue],” said
Bradley.

Most students would think that

moving from UCLA, which is-

only about five minutes from the
beach, to the concrete jungle of
Oakland would be about as

much fun as moving into some-
one else’s wart. But Bradley
doesn't see it that way. ”There
are a million things to do here in
the city,” commented Bradley.

Bradley's also happy to be
closer to his home in Dayton,
where he played his high school
football at Centerville High, be-
cause it's obviously much easier
for his family and friends to see
him play here in Pittsburgh.

Although Bradley has been a
special teams standout this year,
he has yet to earn himself the
right to more playing time at line-
backer. Gottfried couldn’t say
one way or the other whether
Bradley, who has only one year
of eligibility remaining after this
year, would play regularly as a
linebacker next season. ”We’ll
have to see what develops in
practice and in the games,” said
Gottfried.

Bradley admits that he still has
a lot to learn about the new
defense. He also said that ”hard
work is probably going to deter-
mine how much I play.” I

Panthers

All-America candidates, defen-
sive end Tony Woods and line-
man Randy Dixon, both sat out
the game with injuries, as did
talented defensive back Teryl
Austin.

However, Pitt was able to
persevere against _ the 5-4-1
Scarlet Knights, mainly because

V of the surprisingly st-_rong~play of

Felitsky.

In fact, by the time the second
half rolled around, Felitsky was
playing like a veteran, something
he certainly isn't at this point.

”That’s the most I ever played
in a game in my life,” comment-
ed Felitsky.

Despite Felitsky’s strong play,
the Panther offense sputtered at
times and had to settle for two Jeff

VanHorne field goals to increase

.their lead to 13-6 early in the

fourth quarter. -

If there ever was a safe seven-
point lead, this seemed to be it,
as the Pitt defense shut down Rut-
gers’s balanced-"attack.

The Scarlet Knights did have

one good opportunity to score in v

the third quarter when they had

 the ball on the Panthers’ 21-yard

line. _

But Pitt defensive back Gary
Richard saw to it that the Scarlet
Knights’ final scoring opportuni-
ty of the day was thwarted, inter-
cepting quarterback Scott Erney’s
pass at the 10-yard line.

With four minutes left in the
game and the ball on their own
14-yard line, Pitt was trying to run
out the clock. But faced with a

third down and II situation, the
Panthers had to try the airways,
and they can be glad they did.
Felitsky avoided the Rutgers’
blitz and found receiver Michael
Stewart all by his lonesome near
midfield. From there it was afoot
race and, despite the fact that
Stewart was pulled down at the
Rutgers 11, Pitt was able to score,
when three plays later, Heyward

' went in from three yards out to

seal the Panthers’ 20-6 victory.
The victory pushed Pitt's record

_over the .500 mark at 5-4-I , but,

more importantly, it gives the
Panthers needed momentum go-
ing into this weekend's game at
Penn State. - -

”This was a very key win for us
and one that should help us in the
future,” said Gottfried.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November I7, I986

Penn State survives once again, beats Irish

By Herschel Nissenson
AP Writer

SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) —
Penn State's defense bends but
rarely breaks. As a result, the Nit-
tany Lions’ dream of a national
championship still is intact. A

And unless they stumble in
next Saturday's regular—season
finale at home against Pittsburgh,
a national championship show-
down with No. 1 Miami appears
set for the Fiesta Bowl at Tempe,
Ariz., on Jan. 2.

With second-ranked Michigan
losing to Minnesota Saturday,
Penn State undoubtedly will
climb from No. 3 to No. 2 in the
Associated Press poll. The Lions
and Miami, both 10-0, are the
only unbeaten, untied major col-
lege football teams.

But for the second week in a
row, Penn State was fortunate to
escape with a spotless record.

Notre Dame was six yards
away from the winning touch-
down Saturday before the Penn
State defense, No. 9 nationally,
turned the Irish away with three
outstanding plays to preserve a
24-19 victory.

”At the end of the game, we
knew the whole season was on
the line,” said linebacker Don
Graham, who forced a fumble
with a first—period sack that set up
Steve Smith's one—yard run.
Graham also collaborated with

tackle Bob White on another sack I

of Notre Dame quarterback Steve
Beuerlein with 52 seconds left to
play, that pushed the Irish back
from the Penn State 9 to the 18.

WINTER  
INTERNSHIPS
AT
KDKA

Beuerlein, who completed 24
of 39 passes for a career-high 311
yards — Maryland passed for 302
yards against the Lions a week
earlier — hit five in a row to take
the Irish from their 15 to the Penn
State 6 with just over a minute re-
maining.

Free safety Ray Isom produced
the first big play, dropping Tim
Brown for a three-yard loss as he
tried to circle left end. Brown,
No. 2 nationally in a||—purpose
yardage, scored both Notre
Dame touchdowns on passes of
14 and eight yards from Beuer-
lein and had a 97-yard kickoff
return following Penn State's first
touchdown nullified by a clip-

ping penalty.
White and Graham then

dropped Beuerlein for a nine-
yard loss.

”We wanted to get a lot of
pressure on the quarterback,”
Graham said. ”We broke some
blocks and penetrated the back-
field. Then all we had to do was
put Beuerlein in the dirt.”

”Their blitzes were very time-
Iy,” Beuerlein conceded. ”When
we needed a big play, like at the
end when they got that sack, they
came up with the perfect cal|.”

On third-and-goal from the 18,
tight end Joel Williams had
Beuerlein’s pass jarred loose by
cornerback Gary Wilkerson at the
goal line. Beuerlein’s deep
receivers were well-covered on
the fourth down, and he settled
for a five—yard toss to Mark Green
in the flat.

”When we got down to the
high—pressure Notre Dame—about—
to—score situation, we didn't get
nervous and played the way we
should,” said linebacker Pete
Giftopoulos, who recovered
Beuerlein’s first fumble at the
Penn State 22 to set up a 78-yard
touchdown drive. He also inter-
cepted an underthrown Brown-
for-Beuerlein two-point conver-
sion attempt with 7:37 left that
prevented the Irish from thinking
about a last-minute field goal

and, along with Isom, led the way
with 11 tackles.

' Last week, cornerback Duffy
Cobbs preserved a 17-15 triumph
over Maryland by batting down
a two-point conversion pass with
14 seconds left.

Notre Dame, 4-5, threatened to
stage a big upset when it took a
13-10 lead on Beuerlein’s first
touchdown pass to Brown early
in the third quarter.

But John Shaffer regained the
lead for Penn State with a 37-yard
pass to Ray Roundtree late in the
third quarter, then sneaked one
yard for the decisive score early
in the final period.

The touchdown throw which
was Penn State's longest — and
biggest — scoring pass of the sea-
son put the Lions ahead 17-13
and was Shaffer's ninth TD pass,
a career high.

”Coach [Joe] Paterno said this
may have been my best game
ever,” said Shaffer, who was
9-of—13 for 162 yards.

Beuerlein’s second fumble
came on a sack by linebacker
Shane Conlan at the Notre Dame
25 with 1:03 left in the first half
and set up Massimo Manca’s
19-yard field goal that gave the
Lions a 10-6 lead.

Notre Dame's John Carney
kicked field goals of 20 and 38
yards in the second quarter.

”We knew Penn State was a
great defensive football team go-
ing in, and I feel the same way
going out,” said Notre Dame
coach Lou Holtz, whose club
won the statistical battle for the
eighth time in nine games, this
time 418 yards to 314.

”One locker room is happy
and one is not. I really don't
know what else to say. I guess I
could cry and show you that way,
but I can't tell you what's in my
heart,” said Holtz.

”It was a great football game,
if you didn't care who won. Un-
fortunately, we did.”

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November l7, T986

By Jim Urban
Editor-in-Chief

It happens in every sport.

Some call it a- hot streak.
Others refer to it as being in
a groove. Pitt kicker Jeff Van-
Horne calls it being ”on a
roll,’’ and that's exactly what
he is on.

VanHorne, the freshman
from_Cheney, Wash., has so-
lidified his hold on Pitt's
place-kicking game. On Satur-
day, VanHorne kicked two

field goals, from 37 and 42
yards out, and two extra
points. He increased his team-
leading, season point total to
.60. That is the most points
scored by a Pitt player since
Eric Schubert accounted for
69 in 1982.

» ’’I couldn't be happier,” Pitt
head coach Mike Gottfried
said after Pitt defeated Rutgers
20-6 on Saturday. ”You hope
that you can find some play-
ers that have impact right
away, but we did not expect

VanHorn_e: Pitt's top
scorer this season

Jeff to have this kind of an im-
pact this soon.”

VanHorne has hit on all 27
of his extra point attempts

- since taking over the place-

kicking duties from junior
Mark Brasco and 11 of 16 in
the field goal department.

All throughout last season
and through the first several
games of this season, Pitt's
kicking game was a question
mark. Not anymore.

VanHorne had impressive
credentials in high school. He
connected on eight of 11 field
goal attempts during his senior
season, and he holds a league
record in Washington for the
longest field goal (46 yards).
He was regarded as one of the
top five kickers on the west
coast last year, and he has dis-
appointed no one.

”We are real comfortable
with Jeff VanHorne in there,”
Gottfried said. ”He is a hard
worker. I don't think we will
recruit another kicker for two

or three years. He pretty much

the field with the aid of two out-
standing catches by Michael
Stewart. Then from the 18-yard
line, Felitsky scrambled out of the
pocket and found receiver Billy
Osborn in the end zone for his
first collegiate touchdown pass.
‘'1 really felt betteras the day
went on,” said Felitsky. ”Today
was a day of firsts for me. I final-
ly reached the belief that I had in
myself.” ‘
Osborn agreed. ”Joe showed
great mobility on the touchdown.
At first he was throwing really
hard, but as the game went on he
started throwing really well,” said
Osborn. ”He was gaining ex-
perience during the game.”
With the gained confidence
from his first touchdown pass, the

rest of the game was Felitsky’s *

show. He completed key passes
several times and confused the

Rutgers defense. ”They were

blitzing a lot on third down,” said
Felitsky. ”| just watched the line-
backers’ eyes and knew when it
was coming.

”The offensive line did a great
job,” Felitsky added.”They gave
me enough time to find the
receivers and move the ball. They
deserve a lot of credit.”

Felitsky‘ finished the day com-
pleting 20 of 33 passes for 259
yards and one touchdown.

So Joe Felitsky, the hometown
high school kid, finally got the
chance to show what kind of
quarterback he really is. ”| just
want to do whatever I can to
make this team a winner,” said
Felitsky. ”l proved that -today.”

has the job until he leaves.”

VanHorne chose Pitt over
several western schools that
courted him, but he does not
regret the decision to come
back east.

Back home, his family has
all the comforts of a college
field—goa| kicker’s home. Out
back is a football goal post,

_ and not far away from that is
a satellite dish which enables
his parents to view most of the
Pitt football games.

They were able to watch
their son beat Notre Dame
with a last-minute field goal
earlier in the year. That is
when ”the roll” began.

In the past few years, Pitt
was notorious for losing the
close games. The kicking
game was weak. The clutch
field goals were never there.
Now with VanHorne; things
have changed.

’’I remember when I came
in for my recruiting trip last
year,” VanHorne said. ”The
Pitt coaches asked me about
how I would handle pressure.
It was funny — they pointed
out Notre Dame especially.
They wanted to know what I
would do in a pressure situa-
tion like that. l just said I

. would give it my best shot.”

And that he has.

Volleyball team loses to Ohio State

By Kelley Butt

Staff Writer

The Lady Panther volleyball
team concluded their toughest
regular season schedule in seven’
years Saturday night with a loss
to Ohio State» in the champion-
ship match of the Ohio State
Classic. Pitt had to settle for sec-

V ond place in the tournament.

The Lady Panthers, hungry for
a win, easily handled Ball State
in the opening match of the Ohio
State Classic 15-6, 15-6, .15-13.
Coach Shelton Collier stated, ’’I
think we played our best match
of the season against Ball State.”
The win over Ball State ended
Pitt's‘ three-match losing streak.

Saturday night, Pitt was defeat-
ed by the host Buckeyes in the

THE PlTl NEWS, Monday, November I7, 1986

first-place finish of the day.

Delivering yet another top
notch performance for the day
was the 400-yard freestyle relay
team consisting of Jefferies,
Monte, Bill Folger and Charles
Lersch. -

The first-place trend for the
Panthers was also evident in the
1- and 3-meter diving competi-
tions. Seniorlack Shuten execut-
ed a round of top-caliber dives to
earn a first-place finish on the
1-meter board with a score of
295.05. Junior teammate Chris
Blair edged out Shuten in the
3-meter competition to win with
a composite score of 324.15.

”We swam a good meet
against Marshall,” commented
Pitt coach Fred Lewis. ’’I hope the
improvement of individual times
continues next week against Vil-
lanova. Villanova is a top notch
team, and we will get the chance
to see what our team is made of,
swimming against such tough
competition.” Pitt hosts the Wild-
cats at Trees Pool Friday af-
ternoon.

Pitt's women's swim team was
plaguedby illness in the meet

championship match,‘ three
games to one (3-15, 15-12, 15-8,
15-12).

The Lady Panthers showed a
lot of defensive improvement
against Ohio State, and they
played a tough match despite los-
ing. The two teams traded long
rallies throughout the match.

’’I’m proud of the team. We
played some very exciting games,
including great defense with
Ohio State,” said Collier. ”They
are a great team, and we played
well against them.-

”The OSU tournament was a
bit of nostalgia for me. I was
returning to where I played col-
legiate volleyball and began my
coaching career. We certainly
would have liked to win, but I

against Syracuse. Six Lady Pan-
thers were out due to the flu,
while the rest of the team was
feeling under the weather as well.

This factor did not keep the
Lady Panthers from prevailing
151-95 over the Syracuse squad.
The team pulled together under
the circumstances and placed
well in the events.

Although the Lady Panthers
didn't always take first place, the
overall depth of the team pulled
them through. With the adoption
of a new scoring system this year,
which scores three places per
team instead of two, a team with
as much depth as Pitt stands to
gain substantially.

The Pitt women's swim team

foot,lwinning the 400-yard med-
ley relay. Relay members Sandy
Albright, Maureen Cleary, ‘Judy

swam a time of 4:02.69 to secure

think we played very well in spite
ofthe loss.”

Pitt was able to put together an
extremely balanced attack during
the tournament. Captain Sue
Hoover paced the Lady Panthers
with 28 kills, while Lisa Stewart
added 20 kills. 1

Teammates Denise Frawley
and Nora Mulvihill each chipped
in with 19 kills, and Noreen
Coughlin contributed 18 kills to
the Lady Panther cause.

First-year setter Louise
O'Shaughnessey provided a big

boost of confidence for both her- 1

self and the team. O'Shaughnes-
sey had 88 assists. Obviously
Coach Collier was pleased with
those numbers. ”This is a very
significant statistic coming a
week directly before the Big East
tournament. I was very pleased
with Louise's performance,” said
Collier. ”This was a strong tour-
nament, and I think it helped
Louise and the team gain more
confidence as we prepare to host
the Big East title match this
weekend.” A

Lady Panthers Hoover and
Stewart were named to the all-
tournament team.

Pitt will_ host the Big East tour-
nament this Friday, Saturday and

the heavy favorite to win the ti-
tle. A Big East crown would earn

Donovan a superstar
in disguise for Friars

By Jim Urban
Editor-in-Chief

NEW YORK — Take one look
at Providence guard Billy

‘Donovan's face, and it is hard to

believe.

How could this 6-0,
160-pound, baby-faced guard
from Rockville Center, N.Y., fin-
ish eighth in the Big East for scor-
ing with a 15.8 ppg average last
year and -shoot 49 percent from
the field?

How could he finish sixth in as-
sists with a teamhigh total-of 75?
And finally — the clincher — how
could this pigeon-toed, under-
sized basketball player who l_acks
speed finish fifth in the Big East
for steals with anotherteam high
total of 29? '

it wasn't easy.

Nobody has figured out the an-
swers to those questions yet, but
one thing is for sure - this baby-
faced, ' undersized point guard
will draw’ a lot more attention
from opposing teams this year
when the Friars enter the Big East
season.

Providence, ‘ thanks to
Donovan, made great strides last
year, finishing fifth in the Big East
(ahead of Pitt, Boston College, Se-

ton Hall and Connecticut). The‘

Friars also raised some eyebrows

V ‘by advancing as far as the quar-
terfinals of the National Invita-

tional Tournament.

Providence head coach Rick
Pitino, who came to Providence
after serving as an assistant coach
for the New York Knicks of the
NBA, caught a lot of basketball

experts by- surprise last year,

directing the Friars to a 17-14
record. ’ ‘
That record could have even
been a lot better had the Friars
seen the ball bounce their way at

one time or another last year. '

Providence lost by one point to
Villanova, Pitt, Syracuse and
Louisiana Tech -— games the Fri-
ars weren’t even expected to

challenge in. But don't tell Pitino

that.

”l don't consider coming close
any moral victory,” Pitino said. ’’I
consider coming close a loss -

as in a 10- or 20-point loss.”

And that is the attitude he is try-
ing to instill in his young squad.
He does not want the team to rest
on its lau_rels from last year.

”l think the next step is im-
provement for us,” Donovan
said. ”We just have to work as
hard ‘as we possibly can in prac-
tice and try to get better. When
Rick Pitino came to Providence,
he instilled in us the idea that to
be successful, you have to work
hard. We have to continue that
hard work so we can be success-
ful again.” ‘

Providence will field a lineup
that features three returning start-
ers,- including Donovan, 6-9
center Steve Wright, and 6-7 for-
ward Dave Kipfer.

Providence also welcomes
Delray Brooks, a 6-5 transfer from
Indiana.‘ He could be the player
who helps the Friars turn the
corner. Brooks, who transferred
after finding himself in Bobby
Knight's. doghouse at Indiana,
will be eligible to play on Dec.

20 and_ will see actionfin the".

backcourt.

”We only have two backcourt
players right now,” Pitino said.
”Delray Brooks not only gives us
a good player, but he gives us a
much needed third person in the
backcourt." '

But don't expect Brooks to pull
the attention away from
Donovan. Pitino cannot say
enough about him.

’’I thought Billy Donovan was
first team, all Big East last year,"
Pitino said. ”He did more for a
basketball team than any player
in the country can do. Billy does
not possess outstanding athletic
ability, he was surrounded by
mediocre athletic ability and
everybody keyed on him. He
overcame a lot of adversity and
still played well.”

Billy Donovan

Pitino adds what he calls ”the
best recruiting class in the histo-
ry of Providence College,” so
Donovan will no longer be the
lone ranger either.

”He has better talent surround-
ing him now, so Billy might not
score as many points on a given

_ night, but he will still be an ex-

Syracuse. \

Rickert swam an outstanding
race in the 200-yard freestyle, her
specialty. She placed first with a
time of 1:56.40. Teammate
Cleary also had a strong second
race, winning the 100-yard breast
stroke with a time of 1:10.02.

Pitt has some of the best
sprinters in the Big East. This was
evident when Sue Hickman, Terri
‘Ziegler and Cindy Rose took the
first three places in the 50-yard
freestyle. Hickman’s winning
time was 24.00.

Pitt again dominated the score
with another sweep of the top
three places in the 100-yard
freestyle. Hickman rallied to her
second first-place finish of the
day with a time of 53:83. Hick-
man was followed by Rose and
Pam Murphy, who took second
and third places respectively.

Senior Jodi O'Neil swam
strongly in the 200-yard breast

stroke, taking first place with a
time of 2:27.51. Rickert swam to

her third first-place finish of the —

day with a time of 5:13.25 in the

500-yard freestyle. ’
Freshman Laure Walczak

swam her fastest time of the sea-

son in the 100-yard butterfly.-She_ ’ 1
finished with an impressive time

of 59:28.

The first-place finishes ~ con-
tinued in the diving competition.
Junior Cathy McDonald "secured
first place on the 1-meter board
and second on the 3-meter board.
Sophomore teammate Margie
Paulick executed equally impres-
sive performances earning first
place on the 3-meter board and
second place on the 1-meter
board. .

”l was very happy with the way
the team swam against Syracuse.
We weren't up to par physically

but everyone pulled together/"

General Motors is
equipping 10% of its 1987
model cars with automatic
lap/shoulder belt systems
for the driver and for the

right-hand front seat passen-

ger.‘ It is the first step in
meeting a federal require-
ment to phase in passive
restraints.

The automatic sys-

tems will be standard

equipment on most 19877

models of the Pontiac Grand
Am and Bonneville, Buick
Somerset, Skylark, and

' LeSabre, and Oldsmobile
Calais and Delta 88. By»

1990 we plan to equip a_ll

"GM cars with passive

restraint systems. _ .

The belts in the GM
system will be connected to
the car at three anchor points
—one toward the center of
the front seat, and two on
the front door.

Three-point automatic
lap/shoulder belt systems
offer the same advantages
as GM’s current three

pointimanual systems.

Lap and shoulder belts allow

you to “ride down” the crash

as the vehicle absorbs the

impact. They also help pre-
vent you from being thrown

from the car in an accident,
where you are more likely

to be killed or seriously

injured. _

Safety belts have
proved effective in reduc-
ing injuries and fatalities.
That’s why GM supports
belt—use laws. Automatic
lap/shoulder belt systems
will make it even easier for
people to comply with these

. laws.

Opening the door pulls
the belts forward for entry.
Closing it brings the belts
into their operating position.
A single push button at the '
center anchor point releases
the system in an emergency‘.
Retractors pull the released
belts into storage positions
on the door.

Extra attachment
points will be built into
cars equipped with these
systems so you can secure
most child restraint systems
with an auxiliary lap belt.

General Motors is pur-
suing other programs that
will helpreduce the number

caused by accidents. We are

models—kits. will be made
available through GM deal-
ers to retroﬁt most older cars
with these systems. And we
will be equipping some 1988
model cars with driver-side
air bags to supplement safe
belts. . '

General Motors has
been a leader in automotive
safety because we believe
that building safer cars is
good for you. And good for
us.
