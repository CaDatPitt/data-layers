Lois Capin
To Run For
SGA Veep’

By ll/IURRAY CHASS

‘ With ‘student elections ex- .

actly .one A month away, the
second aspirant for a-‘Student

Government Association post A

has announced her candidacy.
Lois Capin, Arts ’6l, revealed
yesterday that she .will run for
vice president of SGA, as the run.-
ning mate of Kent Jarrell. ‘
. J afrell announced his_ candidacy
forppresident of SGA last week.

Miss Capin, currently chairman
of SGA’S Cultural Committee,
won a sophomore position in the
governing body last year running

on the Unitedlndependent ticket. ‘

Concerning the possibility of
forming their ownl party,’ Miss
Capin and Jarrell said, “If there
are enough individuals who are
competent and who show an in-
terest in the policies and ‘pro-

gram which we favor, we aeﬁ-— .

nitely ‘will be interested
forming a party.”. i .

They’ further. mentioned that
they have already talked ‘to six
current members of SGA about
their‘ intentions and found that
run

in,

for re-election.

Meanwhile, if nothing else 

considered at stake in the upcom-
ing election, there will be_ a hat
that may be the ‘object. of a wager».
Chris Gillotti, chairman of the Al-
lied Collegiate party; said earlier
this week that “if J arrell Sdoes not
choose to_ run with the AC party,
I will be willing tQ,bet"a hat that
we will beable to beat him.” '
The bet can be made now
since Jarrell ‘has stated,-that he‘
deﬁnitely will not run with the
Allied Collegiates. e A  - .
Neither Jarrell .and Capin or
the AC party have set a speciﬁc
. date for slating their election
tickets. ‘ i '_
Contrary to what had been pre-
viously announced, no elections
for Liberal ~ Arts class cabinets
will be held this semester.

The .H‘arn~ilt:on[» Plan  . , ;‘.'— .

Panthers He

By Millagd Amdur .

"The Tom Hamilton plan for conversion of Pitt
Stadiumi into a Municipal Stadium has aroused
heated and sometimes irrational debate. Two issues

linvolved have been lumped together as one, which
1 perhaps is as it should be, butgl hope not.

Government Association on;-December 2- to‘ discuss, school .

‘spirit reached this office last‘ week. The published report

is at once revealing and disappointing. Exactly why the

, .‘‘several members” met and under"wh‘ose authorityawasbnot
7 _'clariﬁed~ in the report, but they did ‘reach several con-
— clusions. I i S '

The reason
first "of all “poor over-all calendar planning.” They claim
that some weeks nothing goes on and other ‘weeks are over
loaded with activities.- - _ T ’ p '

.This does not seem reasonable to us as;..a.reason for

events from many offered are certainly not the type of stu-
dents the University‘is striving to. develop and, once more,

for apathy according‘ to the SGA group- are‘

apathy. Students who are not able to choose activities or.

not the kind of students we believe the University now has. V

_The second point under apathy was that communications

.: and good publicity were lacking. Students are not informed

about coming activities soon enough and are not known that _

they are worthwhile. - V
The informational end of the matter is atbleast partially

-— the responsibility of the student newspaper, but we cannot
' and will not comment on the relative value of events for.

this is not good journalism. Whether or notthe reference in
the report was directed at the newspaper, this point must be

"considered.

The government members question freshman indoc-
trination,effectiveness in instilling pride and with this we
must concur. They later suggest, however, that there should
be a feeling of competitionamong the classes. This seems

rather -unrealistic in the light of next yeari’s trimester in-'

ception when the classes will be less permanent.
SGA-_ contends through this group that to help the prob-

I

' twith lmoney. from general University coffers.

One, whether the Panthers should continue to
play in Pitt Stadium in the for- V
seeable future, and two, whether
Pitt Stadium should be ex-
panded. ‘ « ,_ S‘

I believe that ideally these is-'
sues should beytreated, separate-
'ly. The factor wh_ich"'Iinks them
is the‘rumor that the Chan_cel-
lor. _has committed the Univer-
sity to move into Municipal Sta-
dium on the Northside. No one ._
knows what truth there is in this.

Panthers in Stadium - { o

The Hamilton Plan-’s primary objective is cer-
tainly to keep’ the Panthers in the Stadium. It is
not ‘out, o‘_f_" love for the community, or taxpayers,
or anyoneﬁelse that.the athletic director proposes
the conversion of the Stadium.; ; ' .

I, for‘ one,‘ cannot see any reason yet brought

 

up why the Panthers" cannot meet for many years .
to come in the Pitt ‘Stadium. Even I if ﬁnancially a 

liability, the Stadium. should be‘? kept in service‘

Thereuis a certain something in" me which
makes the idea of the ,Panthers moving into a
Northside Stadium very distasteful. The aura of
professionalism is then even ‘more likely to en-

compass the team. The’ relationship of the team to ‘
' the students, faculty,.and ‘alumni ofhthe Univer-

sity is {at stake. ' A

By the time a student would arrive in the‘
Northside Municipalstadium from a pre-game pep
rally or brunch, much of his original enthusiasm
might be gone.'After the game,fby arrival back on

cutting

re,

 

Pitt stadium is as much an integral part ‘or this
campus as any one of the schools and should re-
main as such. ' ‘
Admittedly,.no .very pressing reasons exist‘ for
football to remain here aside from these, but no
reasons “for it to be taken away have presented
themselves. _ . -
Municipal Proieci Necessary? ,  .
- The proposed conversion of Pitt Stadium could
only be accomplished as a‘ municipal project. _Such
a “change would not be necessary for Pitt football
to.remain in the stadj,p,m. The present seating
capacity of the Stadium is not often filled for; a

University football contest and it is questionable‘ -f

whether it willbe in‘the future.

There are many reasons not_to make a Munici-

pal Stadium out of the present Stadium. The Chan-
cellor is openly in favor of providing in this area
an academic atmosphere, i.e., quiet, not traffic.
Supposing _'authorities should begin to ’lo_o_k,_ in
a. more favorable light on the _Hamilton plan“-xivhat
would happen to property values at such businesses
as Gustine’s?’ Ex-Pirate Frankwould have a thriv-
ing ‘business ‘ as would other Forbes Street and
Oakland merchants and would be quitereluctant
to sell at other than exorbitantprices. A
Would Bring Traffic. Noise
1 How »would-the University be able to afford to
buy such properties for redevelopment. The answer
is simply that the University could not and would
never be the campus school, an entity in the Pitts-
burgh, as the Chancellor desires. _
A eWe would have traffic, undesirable characters;
noise, and confusion just‘ as presently exists in this
area. Such a plan would, in short, defeat every-
thing toward which the University has ‘been
moving. ' _ _ ~~ ' ' '
Should it be absolutely necessary in the dis-
tant future, when all other available property in
the Oakland area is University or related property,
then ‘perhaps the Chancellor might consider the

' campus from the» Northside, scant feeling would, ~ use of Pittstadium for redevelopment.

They also say that “SGA can publicize its business and
show __that the leaders have some influence.” SGA should
certainly see that its business is publicized, but whether this
will or will not show that the leaders have inﬂuence will
depend upon the nature of their work. SGA"I__nig.ht well for

earlierin the year. It is admirable that some SGA members

~ have attacked the problem of student apathy.

In short, these SGA members put together a report

,which ‘hints at answers, butidoes not go far enough. The

problem of apathy is adifificult one and we would hope that

tan authorized SGA committee will come up with a more

significant report in the near future.

Not Important Here

‘ editorial
,Arises Again.”

Editor,’ The Pitt News:

In the Feb. I1"edition of, the“.

Pitt News, there appeared an
entitled, “Apathy
In this article
you made several statements
whichalthough. very true, hard-
ly scratched the surface of the

at.’Pitt. t .-
You wrote of “a clear case -of

‘ problemsof student government -

apathy_in the student body. Few"

students regard-‘student, govern-
ment as, more important than
other commitments activity-
wise . . . students fail to feel

i that student government is im-

portant.”

Well, I have attended this‘

University for three semesters,
now, and not only do I regard
student government as'less im-
portant than other University

activities, not only do I fail to":

feel that student government is
important, I have yet to discover
just what or where our student
government is. A ~

Along with an overwhelming
percentage of the student body,

.I have ,_no ideaof the structure,
purpose, goals, or officers be-

longing to our government.
You accuse the student body

of being grossly apathetic to the ‘

 N ewsi .

 

coming elections as well as stu-

dent .gover_nment, at large. But
you "couldn’t be more wrong.
Youare confusing apathy with
ignorance, yes ignorance. We of
the student -body are not apath-

unhealthy situation for one can-
didate to—run‘for. a major posi-
tion, --but_ you have overlooked
an even more distressing situa-

tion. That situation is the vote»
inthe hands of an unenlighten-

ed body. _

Would it not seem more con— \

structive for your paper to un-
dertake a project for enlighten-
ing the student body rather than
writing a regular annual editor-
ial on apathy at election time.
Mr. Editor, it isinot that the
students of this University fail
to see the signiﬁcance of their
governmen't,_it is rather that

they fail to realize its existence. _

They look upon student gov-
ernment as an Estates ’General
which meets , at election time
only for mere formality.

In fact, the average“ student of
this university knows perhaps

more about the Estates General '
than his , own student ‘gover_n- -

ment. This is most ,assuredly,'in
your own words, ‘
healthy situation.” . _

In a democratic system such

- “never a an

Otherwise, let’s keep the Panthers at Pitt, send
’ e " the pros-’ to’ the Northside. -

U, '.LetterseL To Thei-Editor A

In‘ the same issue, the AC

-party admitted that “in the past .

it has been dominated by one
interest group, but now all’ this
willibe changed.” But still no
plans for a platfqrmxhave been
presented.——This is ’what' your
paper called “definite in ideas.”

In conclusion, I would like to
say that I have not written this
article --simply to criticize, but
in hope that it might cause. some
improvement. ,

For as long as the student
body of this‘Unive1'sity remains
ignorant of the student govern-
ment, as'long as it continues to
attend th_is school without ever

feeling the influence or author-_ ._,_
ity of the Student Government

Association, that long will

“apathy” remain. Enlighten the

student body at large, and then
you will enjoy an active flour-

‘ishing student government.

One dissatisfaction of the stu-

ed by the mail delivery. The

Saturday when many students

_ Many times the ‘weekly mail,.

be slowed in coming some dis-
tance, and would perahps- arrive
on Saturday. Often the mail may

Painthers Hope i
it  To End 3-Year

D I %Winless Streak

By LARRY I-IAGGERTY
Owners of the nation’s ﬁn-

i_:est basketball, record last sea,-
-.json, 26' wins and twddefeats,
-?:the ‘Nest Virginia Mountain-

eers come to the Field House

tonight at 8:30‘ with the idea.

V ofsweeping the annual home and

home series from the Panthers for
the third consecutive season.

The last Blue and Gold _triumph
over the Mountaineers ‘came in .

the ﬁnal game’ of the 1955-56
campaign at Morgantown, 94-77?.
This also.was the last loss for
West Virginia. on its home court.

Jerry VVest, the man respon-
sible for emphasizing the West
in “lost Virginia, leads‘ the
highly-ranked boys from Mor-
gantown. West is the nation’s
seventh leading scorer with a
25.4 point average per game and
was selected on every pre-sea-
son All-American squad. .

Joining West in the “starting
lineup for Coach —Fred. Schaus’ ag-
gregation are Bob~ Smith, Bob
Clousson, Bucky Bolyard and
Willie Akers, Top reserves for
the Mountaineers are Ronnie Ret-
ton, Jim Ritchie, Lee Patrone and
Joe Posch. ‘

Whereas many top scorers pad
their averages against already.-
beaten opponents, West saves his
best efforts for the tough games
away from home. His hi-gh marks
are 44 points at Tennessee, ’36 at
Kentucky, 36 at Villanova and 33
at Penn State.

In the six games which West
Virginia has won going away,
West served an average 28 min-
utes of playing time. Minus the
ballyhoo, gimmick or» astronom-

---ical average, West stands ﬁrmly .

as one of America’s outstanding
basketball players.

— All-American Don‘Hennon will

try to make amends for his poor
showing in the ﬁrst game at Mor-
gantown which was won by West

Virginia, 73-64. Hennon was held‘

to 13 points, his low of the year.

Last year’s meet was close all

‘able to edge out a 46-38 victory.
Syracuse has three out of four of

their’ relay team members back

Orangemen “1ook strong.” Lou

Not too long ago, All-Ameri-
can basketball player Don Hen-
non went; to an assistant dean ’
to discuss a schedule problem.

“Sit down, Mr. Hénnon,” the
assistant dean said.

_“I would like to have one of
.my afternoon classes changed,
to the morning if at all possi- .
_ ble, sir,”- Hennon said. “I plan’ ‘
_ to be out for two varsity sports
and might miss too much prac-
tice. I want to take the same
course but at~a different time.”

“I just love sports,” the dean
replied. “By th‘e way Mr. Hen-
non, what sport do you play?”

1. It combines the efficient filtering

_ _ 7 willtravel to Navy this .-Saturday
’ ‘ ‘for a triangular meet» with Navy

and :Maryland.» . so

Navy has three outstanding per-
in Fred March, Louis
Hilder, and John Neal. March
runs the 600-yard event in which

&.his best time is 1:12.8. Hilderis

Navy"s high jumper, "while Neal is
outstanding in the hurdles. Ac_—-
cording to Coach Rees Navy has
plenty of depth. '
Maryland, like Navy, also has
plenty of strength. Maryland’s
Bergh Anderson is‘ a pole vaulter
and currently going over 14 feet.

,Paul Wittakei‘ does the 60-yard

dash in 6.2 seconds. “That should
be a good race," Rees said, “Since
Barnwell equaled the world in-
door record in that event last
week." - 4

This is also the first ‘time Rees
will have his entire squad at any
meet. =-:1: our: depth can hold up,”
‘Rees commented, “we will be in
good_sh.a»pe." Since it hasn’t.-been
tested as yet the overall team
strength is still a question."
