Annual Pitt-Penn State
blood drive kicks off

By Christine Hanna
Staff Writer

The Pitt—Penn State rivalry
continues, but this time off the
football ﬁeld as the annual blood
drive kicked off yesterday.

The Red Cross and Central

« Blood Bank collected 232 units

of blood from Pitt students and
faculty on the first day of the
drive, according to mobile-unit
supervisor Mary Bailey._

Bailey said the Pittsburgh area
has twice the national average
need for blood, since it is the
location for large medical centers,
trauma centers and transplant
institutions. '

The population in the
Pittsburgh area is also aging, and
there is an extra need for blood
for the elderly, according to
Bailey.

,Brent Sahl, a blood drive
chairperson for the Greeks, said,
“Since there is such a shortage in
the Central Blood Bank, any
means of getting blood is an
effective means.” - .

Sahl said that he’s always given
blood and when he saw that the
drive needed chairpeople, it

"caught his interest, and he

applied.

Cheryl Weigang, a sister of
Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority,
said, “I think it’s pretty impressive
since we beat Penn State last
year. You can say we’re pretty
dedicated."

Last year during the blood-

drive challenge, Pitt topped Penn
State’s 2,625 units of blood with
3,255 units. A
“We've got to do it. We’ve got
to beat Penn State. We should

save more lives than Penn State
students,” Pitt student Dan
Mancini said. '

“I’m giving blood for myself.
It’s an important thing,” Pitt
student Joel Pirchesky said.

Along with the university
challenge, the Pitt Greeks are
battling for the most units.

Leslie Pryor, a receptionist for
Central Blood Bank, said that
giving Pitt fraternities and
sororities points for Greek Week
provides incentive for Greeks to
donate blood.

“Everyone is anxious for points.
That’s always a big thing,” Pryor’
said.

“I think it’s a real good thing
that the Pitt Greeks and other
individuals come out,” Greek
blood-drive Chairperson Liza
Zabriski said. .

When Zabriski became
involved, she-said she realized
that she was not only helping the
Greeks, but she was helping to
save lives.

“It’s incredibly important. If we
were. in an accident and needed
blood, it would be available. It
doesn't ‘matter who beats who;
it’s just important to get the
blood. Maybe since there is a
challenge, more people will come
out," Pitt student Julia Evans
said.

Donors must be healthy and
over the age of 17. They are
asked to read a brochure which
questions their medical history.
After reading the brochure, a
member of the medical staff will
ask them questions once again in
private. Then the donors will go
through a mini physical to assure
that they are healthy.

Presby replaces charts wits computers

By Robert Roman
For The Pitt News

The cardiothoracic surgical
intensive-care unit at Presbyterian
University Hospital has begun
using a computerized clinical-
information system that eliminates
multi-paged patient charts and
mountains of other clinical
paperwork according to Keith
Stein, M.D., medical director of
the unit and project leader.

The user-friendly system
instantly compiles and integrates
information on one screen at each
patient’s bedside, giving clinicians
immediate access to vital data
without having to sort through
pages of handwritten docu-
mentation or wait for laboratory
test results, Stein said.

The Critical Care Information
System is a computer network
which retrieves information
automatically by communicating
with bedside monitors_ and

laboratory—information systems
throughout the hospital. Data
entries also can be made by
clinicians. The information is then
instantly available for review at
bedside and distant work stations.

“The system enhances the
information available to clinicians
and improves our ability to
promptly respond to life-
threatening changes in a patient’s
condition and make appropriate

_decisions,” Stein said.

_ CCISishelpfulinwriting clinical
reports and generating research
information because it provides
consistent documentation of
patient care and serves as a
permanent data base. The health-
care team can look at the
information all at once in the
form of computerized graphs and
charts. _ ' ’

These show the short- and long-
term effectsof therapy and patient
progress, . according to Marilyn

’ Hravnak, a registered nurse and

coordinator of the critical—care,

nursing-specialist graduate
program at Pitt’s School of Nursing
and ' CCIS associate project
leader.

“For nurses, the computers are
especially time—saving,” Hravnak
said. “We can spend more time
focusing on our patients and less
time gathering and documenting
information. The system saves us

from having to manually collect‘

data. It also provides a strong
basis for nursing research,
allowing us to more precisely
examine the effect of nursing
activities on patient outcomes."

CCIS, which costs roughly
$750,000, is the result of a four-
year project by Pitt Medical Center
critical—care specialists to develop
a more efficient method of
integrating the large volume of
diagnostic information within the
surgical intensive-care unit, which
inclu_des many heart- and lung-
transplant recipients. -

Breathing difficulties

’ By Jackie Estkowski

hit transplant patient

Staff Writer

Sarah Kelton, the world’s youngest heart-transplant recipient,
regressed from fair to critical condition late last Wednesday as
she suffered breathing difficulties. 4

The seven-week-old Kelton, who had been in fair condition
at Children’s Hospital for almost a week, returned to the
pediatric intensive-care unit, where she was again placed on a
respirator. ' -.

Early in October, Kelton was taken off the respirator an
transferred to the infant surgical unit.

According to Children’s spokesperson Toby Trosky, Kelton
had difficulty feeding from a bottle and ingested milk intoone
of her lungs.

Trosky said that because Kelton had been fed by a tube for_
almost a month after she was born, she was not able to learn
the natural sucking process of newborns. This, T rosky said,
probably contributed to her passing milk into a lung, which
caused respiratory problems. A ,

On Thursday, Oct. 31, -however, Kelton was removed from T
the respirator. Her new heart continues to function W611. TI 0519’

People deal with conﬂict in myriad. of Ways CORRECTION

There are some people who
seem to thrive on conﬂict They
seek out or create conflict at
every opportunity and feel most
alive when they are in the midst

of battle. Most of us, however, ..

are as attracted to conﬂict as we
are to communicable diseases.
Whether we love it or despise
it, conﬂict is a normal part of the
human condition, and although
it can be destructive it also can be
healthy. Conﬂict within
relationships, for example, is to
be expected since we all differ

‘ from each other in so many ways.
' Even brothers and sisters from

the same environment develop

different values, different ways
of looking at things and different
temperaments. People from
different cultures may bring even
further diversity to the campus
setting. It is the expression of
these differences that often leads
to conﬂict, and it is through the
resolution of these conﬂicts that
most of us grow as individuals.
One of the most common ways
that people handle conflict is by

avoiding it. We do this by hiding
the ways in which we are different
from those around us, by putting
aside our own beliefs or values,
or by ignoring the things other
people do or say that hurt us.

One reason we avoid conflict‘

is because the emotion it
engenders in us and in others
may feel overwhelming. Usually
this fear of emotion is tied to our
early upbringing. If the emotions
expressed in a family are intense
and explosive, a young child can
be frightened and develop a fear
of conflict of any kind, which
may carry over into adulthood.
Other children may be brought

For The Pitt News

Nationally ranked karate
competitor and Pitt campus police
officer Curtis Smith’s “Buy
Yourself A Minute” self-defense
program teaches students to use
physical contact as the last resort.

The program was developed
by Smith to instruct students how
the criminal mind works and
how to prevent altercations. Smith
also instructs students how to
defend themselves properly using
the techniques demonstrated.

The seminar is a three-day
session sponsored by the Student
Government Board. It is not a
regular self—defense class, which
is more geared toward sport,

according to Smith.

The “BYAM” program is a
different kind of methodology,
Smith said. “It is an overall
identiﬁcation of how the criminal
tries to set you up. Physical
altercation is the last resort,” Smith’
said.

“A lot of times classes
emphasize kicking, punching,
blocking, etc., but there are
variables before that point,” he
said. Preventive measures are very
important, according to Smith.
“By wit not by brawn is the key to
prevention,” Smith said.

There is a psychology of
walking, body-language identi-
fication and personal-space

Sera—Tec oﬂers students
‘blood-moneyiprogrozm

By Christine Hanna
sum‘ Writer

Students who want to earn a
few extra dollars can donate
plasma from their blood at Sera-
Tec Biologicals on Forbes
Avenue.

First—time donors receive $10,
with a $5_bonus each time they
return.

Leslie Yeager, manager of Sera-

’ Tec, said that this program should

not be used as an access to party
money, but it can be used to
make living easier.

Yeager said the collection
process, autophoresing, takes the
plasma out of the blood. Then
the blood is returned to the body.

“We collect raw material. We
collect plasma,” Yeager said.

Pharmaceutical companies.

throughout the United States
depend on Sera—Tec for plasma
every day.

The plasma is used for many
things. Some of the uses are as an
antihemophiliac for bleeders,
rogam for RH-negative women
and albulrnine for burn victims.
“When you get burned, you need
protein,” Yeager said.

According to Yeager, Sera—Tec
tests every donation for Hepatitis-

‘ B, Hepatitis—C, HIV-1, HIV-2 and

venereal diseases. A liver-enzyme
test and a serum electrophoresis
test are also performed.

The enzyme test screens for
any toxins in the liver, while the

electrophoresis’ test ﬁnds if the’

body is affected by any disease.

All donors must meet specific
requirements. They must be in
good health, weigh more than
110 pounds and be between _18
and 65.

According to Emily Johnson, a
secretary at Sera—Tec, the donors’
protein, iron and sugar levels are
checked before they are allowed
to donate plasma.

Yeager said that approximately
120 donors come in per day. A
donor may come in twice in
seven days. Each donation takes
20 minutes to an hour, but the
screenings take a lot longer.

Pam D’Andrea of the Central
Blood Bank said the procedure
must be ﬁne since the criteria for »
Sera—Tec is the same as the Blood

\ Bank’s.

donors donate blood to Sera—Tec
they must go through a general

The African—American Pitt perS0rl. William Pitt U_rli0rl-

Alumni Club is developing a
mentor program that will
help guide African—American
students toward graduation.

The program will match a
student with an alumnus
from the AAPAC who has
the same interests and has
studied in the same field as
the student. The alumnus
will work with the student to
provide academic support.

Nona Martin, founder of-

_ theA_APAC, said this type of
program“ has" ' to be-
established to fulﬁll the needs -
of black studentsfisihe said‘
she believes the program will
help students graduate and
formulate ‘career goals.

Martin said she feels
optimistic that- the program

‘will'“be successful at Pitt

because similar mentoring

_ programs have worked well
at other universities.

Marta Effinger, chairperson
of the Black Action Society,
said she believes the alumni _ , _
wmprovide valuable Support savings plans for olf—campus students, the SelectSaver5“ Plan, lets you direct-dial the one out-of—state area code
and share personal
experiences that the student
can draw upon to improve
academically in order to ’
eventually graduate . , you call most often’. For just $1.90 a month, and 12 cents a minute, evenings, nights and weekends. 20 cents

“Because they have
graduated and are
considered successful, they
can be of some aid to students
whehavenetyetgraduatedg a minute, weekdays?‘ El And now AT&T can take you to another place you’ve always wanted to go. Just
Efﬁnger said.

Effinger said the success
of this program depends on
the commitment of the i ' ‘
alumni as wen as we enter the AT&T “It Can Happen to Me” Sweepstakes. You could win a trip for you and a guest to any US. and any
students. Both members of
the team must want it to
work and accept the
responsibilities the part- . .
nership requires meme, to European rock concert. All you have to do is ﬁll out the coupon below. D So let us help you choose the
succeed, she said. I

“It would be the
responsibility of the team
that is matched up to decide . . ‘ .
how they can he1p one savings plan that’s right for you. And then try your luck at our Sweepstakes. Both will be music to your ears-
another,” Efﬁnger said.

Apartment dwelling impossible to tolerate

I know what you’re thinking. Whylis it that

a college students pay so much to live in

college apartments where the landlords are
jerks and nothing ever works? Well, never

' fear. I have the answers to this question and

more. Just read on, and you will be enlight-
ened. ‘

As we all know, off-campus housing is a
difficult commodity to come by in any uni-
versity area. It’s even more challenging to ﬁnd
good, affordable places to reside in during
your college years. You shouldn’t have to put

A up with a constant headache from living in an

undesirable college apartment and dealing
with a landlord from hell. That's why there is
such a huge demand to live in on-campus
dormitories, where you have to take an elevator
10 ﬂoors up to rooms that you share with five
other people who you probably don’t know
and probably don’t like anyway. But you can't
go up until after you’ve signed in your guest,
who you do know and do like (after all, that’s_
why you're taking them 10 stories up to your
room), with the ever-present desk attendant,
who is there to perform the always important
job of pretending to be a security officer.
These are some of the reasons so many
unsuspecting students choose to live in nearby
apartments. Whether you choose North
Oakland or South Oakland doesn't make that
big of a difference, no matter what people tell
you. So here we are. We have 10,000 students
trying to live in a limited number of apartments.
The apartments are usually not very nice, and
the rent is usually too high. If you’re one of the
few, lucky students who this doesn't apply to,
then stop reading, go back to your apartment
and kiss the ﬂoor because you’re very fortu-
nate, as you probably already know by now
unless you ’ve been living in a vacuum like
John Travolta did in that classic seventies ABC
movie of the week, “The Boy in the Bubble.”
The reason, of course, why apartments are

David W. A
Matta

like this in Oakland is because they can get
away with it It’s the simple law of supply and
demand. If you don’t like an apartment be-
cause it's too lousy ortoo expensive, then
some other sucker will surely be willing to
rent it. I looked at, oh, give or take ~ 100
apartments this summer in my quest to move
closer to school and move out of my farnily’s
house. I saw a lot of apartments all over the
Oaldand area, and I got a pretty good feel for
how things work around here.

So my roommate and I live in an apartment
where we pay waytoo much and_we get wa
too little. ’

Our landlords are part of a supposedly
reputable group of apartment-rental agencies
in Pittsburgh, but they have, well, in layman's
terms, sucked. I could go into gory details
about the zany things that have happened to
my roommate and I since we moved in, but

you’ve probably heard them all before, or you '

really don’t care. I can respect that. I’m a
Pisces. Anyway, if you’re a resident of Oak-
land, then you know all too’ well what I'm
talking about, so just photocopy your horror
stories and put my name at the top, and that
will suffice.

So what’s the point of my story, aside from
this being my ﬁrst column in two months
(because I was too busy stressing out over my
new place of residence to write). It’s intended
to be sort of a comeback article (like the
Pirates this season and “Back for more.” You

know how well these things always workout). »

Despite the fact that there is no arguing that
the landlords around here know what the
market for apartments is, and they take ad-

vantage of college students and their parents,
I do believe that there is some responsibilityto
be laid on the students who live in these
apartments.
I know the students wholive in my building
don’t appear to care at all about how they
treat the place. The lobby has been messed up

or vandalized at least four times since the’

beginning of the school year. They don’t
place their garbage in the trash dumpsters in
the front of the building. Instead they play a

very entertaining game of Drop The Trash '

from the balconies above the dumpster and
try to hit the target. If they miss, so be it.

To amuse ourselves on those slower nights
of the week, when “Doogie Howser, M.D.”
just won't do it, my roommate and I sit out on
our balcony and watch the trash bags and
beer cans come down past our balcony on
their way to the mound of garbage below. It’s
great fun. One night some of the fellows that
live above us urinated from their balcony into
the dumpster.

So how can I expect my landlord to re-

spond to my needs and requests when there
are Neanderthals living in my building who
behave worse than kindergartners? It’s this
type of irresponsible, typical, college-student
behavior which contributes to the rights of
landlords to take advantage of their tenants.
I don’t begin to condone this attitude as
appropriate or acceptable, but I don’t think it
helps to improve relations between tenants
and landlords.
' Maybe if both parties decided simultaneously
to clean up their acts, then this whole thing
wouldn't be a problem anymore. Such a thing
as mutual respect and proper human behav-
ior might not be such a bad idea in this
scenario.

This letter is in response to the
Oct. 24 Pitt News article: “Student
Files Suit Against Prof." We have
been Dr. Keith Brown’s students in
the past and are outraged at the
unjust accusations which have been
leveled at Dr. Brown in this biased
and unbalanced article.

Not only were Mary Anne

no attempt was made to provide a

would have assured Tatusko that
Dr. Keith Brown is one of the most
scrupulously fair and concerned
professors that we have ever had
the privilege to work with and
learn from. Tatusko’s cavalier atti-
tude unjustly sullied the reputation
of one of Pitt's finest professors.
Kramer's main contention against

Dr. Brown is that his and Dr. Boster’s
attitudes changed toward her after
she wrote a critical letter about
their course. This is patently false.
Departmental policy prohibits the
release of students’. names who
have submitted course critiques.
Therefore we, who have also
submitted criticisms of core courses,
have never been concerned about
recrirnination. H

were no comments on the exam

 Biased article muddled reality of situation

remain in the departmental ﬁles,
and therefore comments are not
written on them. However Dr.
Brown provided Kramer with three
separate pages of comments
evaluating her exam. Kramer also
accused Dr. Brown of being fre-
quently absent from class; however
as Dr. Bosterwas the primary course
instructor, this is not relevant to her
argument.

Kramer claims that as a Ph.D. in
anthropology she would have made
$50,000 for 20 years. First of all, it
is never a certainty that anyone
will obtain their doctoral degree; it
requires many years of hard work.
Wouldn’t it be lovely if all of us
graduate students could simply sue
the university for money we sup-
posedly would make in our careers

rather than actually go through all

of the work it takes to build a
career?

Second, we’d like to know where
she was planning on applying for
employment! No Ph.D. in anthro-
pology graduates‘ and makes
$50,000 a year; we’re lucky if we
make that much when we get
tenure.

Having worked and learned with
Dr. Brown for several years, we
feel strongly that he is both an
excellent educator and a wonder-
ful human being. It is therefore
very unfortunate that T atusko ine-
sponsibly presented one person's
wild and unjust accusations against

Election time

Parasitic ex-Klan member rurmi

Throughout the last few months,
if you have paid any attention at
all, you have most likely been
concerned with the recent local
elections and the battle for the
Senate seat left open by the death
of John Heinz. I’m sure that not
many of us have paid attention to
the elections going on around the
rest of the United'States.

Well, if you haven’t paid atten-
tion — start. In case you didn't
know: Louisiana state Rep. David
Duke, former grand wizard of the
Ku Klux Klan and proclaimed neo-
Nazi, is running for governor in an
election that some experts give
him an even chance of winning.

Have you heard about this? A
neo-Nazi and former head of the
KKK as a governor? I guess I
shouldn’t worry that a man who
preaches hate and bigotry just may
be the next governor of Louisiana.

After all, I don’t live in Louisiana,
and I don’t plan on moving there
after I graduate.

Actually, the idea of David Duke
getting elected scares me a whole
lot. It isn’t Duke so much but the
fact that the rise in his popularity
has made racism and hate accept-
able. Just like Hitler, Mussolini,

Brett
Gilman  

etc., Duke, is a brilliant demagogue 1
who knows how to bring legitimacy '
to his demented thoughts.

The Duke of today does not
make blatant racist appeals. He
dismisses his past associations as
“youthful mistakes." His focus on
mainstream conservative issues ——
affirmative action, teen-age preg-
nancy, welfare reform, etc. — has
allowed him to broaden his con-
stituency among better-educated
rniddle-class voters without alien-
ating his racist base.

‘ In his rallies Duke attempts to
cover his racist views. He concen-
trates on a welfare underclass that
leeches off the productive taxpayer
in order to feed its drug habit and
produce more illegitimate babies.
Furthermore, he stresses the mas-
sive reverse discrimination of af-
firmative-action policies. His fans,
mostly blue-collar, like what they
hear.

' While_Duke stresses mainstream
conservative issues, his views are

blatantly racist We are not talking
about a few “youthful mistakes"
here. .9

We are talking about a man who
sold a book called The Hitler We
Loved and Why; a man who be-
lieves in racial science; a man who
has publicly expressed admiration
for Dr. Josef Mengele of the
Auschwitz concentration camp and
a man who has said that blacks are
genetically predisposed toward
criminal behavior.

People — a lot of people —— are
voting for this parasite. Obviously,
most of them agree. Why? Duke is
simply wrong. First of all, black
fertility rates in Louisiana have been
falling, not rising. Furthermore, the
welfare underclass is not respon-
sible for the.economic difficulties
in Louisiana. According to TheNew
Republic magazine, the average
monthly welfare benefits in Loui-
siana are the fifth lowest in the
nation, and the annual welfare
outlay amounts to only two percent
of the total state budget.

Yet Duke has managed to rally
an entire movement around the
folklore that welfare spending is
responsible for high taxes and that
blacks are taking jobs away from

rig for governor

whites.

Just like Hitler, who blamed the.
Jews for Gerrnany’s financial diffi-
culties, Duke is blaming a particu-
lar facet of society to legitimize his
beliefs.

David Duke represents the

growing intolerance of the people
in this country. The United States is
a nation founded on diversity. For
over 200 years immigrants (another
thing Duke wants to stop) have
come here to escape persecution
and social injustice.

You would think that after 200
years of practice, we would have

learned to be tolerant and to value ‘

the diversity that makes the United '
States — well, the United States.

Yet for some strange reason we
feel a need to slander any idea that
is different from our own and to
vote for people like David Duke
and Jessie Helms, who represent,
the status quo.

It’s actually kind of ironic. Duke
represents the efforts to extort
conformity in a nation that was,
paradoxically, built on free speech
and diversity.

Mudslinging senatorial campaigns disillusion voters

Ahhh, Pennsylvania. The state of the 1991

OI am a closet Sacramento Kings fan.

Stanley Cup champions, shopping outlets and
Amish farmers who take great pleasure in
driving their buggies 10 miles per hour. Penn-
sylvania is the only state where Gov. Robert
Casey is in stiff competition with Oscar the
Grouch for “Oddest Eyebrows.”

With the possible exception of Arizona,
Pennsylvania also has the most colorful cam-
paigns of any state. Sure, Arizona had Evan
Meecham, but not even’ he could top Casey’s
1986 accusation that Bill Scranton, the Repub-
lican gubernatorial candidate, once belonged
to a bizarre religious cult that prayed to larger-
than-life statues of Garfield the cat. (I'm not
entirely sure about what they worshiped, but
the rest is true. Take my word for it.)

Anyway, I was reminded of the great history
of Pennsylvania mudslinging a few days ago.
The baseball game I was watching was rudely
interrupted by a commercial informing me that
Harris Wofford had ties to arms dealers who
always seem to have a spotlight on them every
time they step out of a car.

Disillusioned, I told my roommate, “Boy,
thank God for Dick Thornburgh. Without him,
who would've guessed that the former-presi-
dent of Bryn Mawr is in league with a brightly
lit arms dealer.’_’

“Huh?” he replied.

Adam Richter

No sooner did I make up my mind, however,
than a second political commercial came on,
‘explaining how Thornburgh was violently op-
posed to national heath care. .

“What next?" I thought. Is Thornburgh also
opposed to answering machines with dumb
messages and to Koosh balls?

Outraged at all of this mudslinging, I decided
to do something about it.

Yes, that's right! You guessed it!

I’m running for Senate. »

Now the only way I can stop the mudslide
that I may face today is to dig up every dirty,
secret and evil deed I’ve ever done before
Thornburgh and Wofford get to me. So here is
a brief resume of my life of wrongdoings and
moral turpitude:

-In 1985 I willingly cut in line in ‘front of an
old woman at Klein’s Bakery in Reading, Pa.
Not only that, but I later ran over said woman's
feet with my shopping cart.

-For the past 12 years I have been an
outspoken advocate of banning higher math
from elementary schools.

-Last year I founded the Henry IV Land

9 Lady Panthers open with exhibition loss to Athletes in Action

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

The Pitt Lady Panthers lost an
exhibition game last night to
Athletes in Action, 76-61.

Most teams schedule an
exhibition to help them warm up

* for the upcoming season. The

scheduled patsy usually puts up
a fight for about one quarter of
the game and then surrenders
peacefully.

However not many teams have
a former National Collegiate
Athletic Association Player of the
Year on their team or a frontcourt
with two 6-foot, 4-inch starters.

Athletes in Action had both.
Jennifer Azzi won player of the
year honors in 1990 while helping
her Stanford Cardinal team to the

I _ NCAA women’s basketball crown

Azzi toasted the Lady Panthers
for 31 points (17 of them in the
first half), leading AIA. She played
33 minutes in the contest, sitting
down with over seven minutes
left in the game.

“She's just a great player,” said
Pitt head coach Kirk Bmce. “She’s
exciting and really fun to watch.
However I thought that Jill
McElhinny did a great job
defending her, and I was surprised
she got as many as she did.

“This team was definitely more
experienced and more mature
than we are,” Bruce said. “They
have some really strong girls out
there that had really strong college
careers.”-

AIA’s frontcourt of Susan
Anderson, Lisa Becker and Sheri
Alexander dominated the smaller
post players of the Panthers.
Anderson had 16 points, 16
rebounds (11 on the defensive
end) and two blocked shots.
Becker contributed six points, six
boards and two blocks. Alexander
came off the bench for four points
and 10 boards.

The Lady Panthers were
outrebounded 59-38 overall.
Athletes in Action snagged 31
boards in the second half to Pitt’s
16. ‘

The Lady Panthers have lost
some size in the frontcourt, with

Lorri Johnson and Connie Hurt
graduating.

Pitt also shot a dismal 50 percent
from the free—throw line.

They hit 11 of 22 attempts from
the charity stripe in the second
half and three of six in the first
half.

Athletes in Action, on the other
hand, converted 79 percent of
their attempts overall, including
eight out of nine shots in the first
half and three of ﬁve in the second.

The game started out close,
with the two teams exchanging
leads until the 12:06 mark of the
first half.

At that point, a free throw by
sophomore center Carolyn Miller
put the Lady Panthers up 13-12.
Sophomore guard Jill Colabrese
followed with a jumper at the
11:32 mark, giving Pitt a three-
point lead.

They extended their lead to as 9

many as seven with 10:32 to play
in the half.

The turning point of the half
and the game occurred with 9:09
remaining in the half. After a
layup by Miller gave Pitt a 21-16
advantage, junior forward Turia
Ransom hit the ball while it was
still out of bound in an AIA
player’s hand.

The resulting technical foul
allowed ALA to pull within one
after Azzi made the two foul
shots and a layup.

After Colabrese missed the front
end of a one—and-one foul-shot
opportunity, Azzi made another
layup, giving Athletes in Action
the lead, 22-21.

Athletes in Action extended
their lead to as many as nine
before the half, before two field
goals by junior forward McElhinny
and one by Ransom cut it to 36-
31 at the break.

Pitt tied the score with less than
a minute into the second half
after junior forward Tiffany
Fingers hit two free throws and
sophomore guard

Erin Maloy canned the Lady
Panthers’ only three—pointer of
the night.

Azzi responded with eight

Two Texans give commitments to men’s hoop team

By Derek Willis
Asst. Sports Editor

The Texas pipeline for Pitt basketball
has produced two more players.

Head coach Paul Evans received oral
commitments from Eric Redeaux of
Beaumont and Garrick Thomas of Aldine,
Because the early signing period for high-
school recruits does not start until Nov. 13,
Redeaux and Thomas have not officially
signed a letter of intent with Pitt.

If they do sign, it would bring the
number of Texans who became Panthers
to four in the last three years. The others
are current team members Tim Glover, a
sophomore guard from Clear Lake, and

Chris Bennett (formerly Chris Gant), a

ﬁrst-year forward from Smiley High School
in Houston.

Redeaux is a 6-foot, 8-inch, 215-pound
forward who averaged 18 points and 10
rebounds a game last year for Beaumont-
Central High School. Thomas," a 6-4 guard
from ‘MacArthur High School in Aldine, a
Houston suburb, averaged 19 points, 11
rebounds and four assists last year. Both
are among the top prep players in Texas,
although neither player participated at
any summer all-star camps since Texas
players are forbidden to do so.

According to The Pittsburgh Post
Gazette, Redeaux had yet to score 700 on
his SAT, while Thomas has achieved the
minimum score on the ACT and would be
eligible to play as a first-year student.

The verbal commitment from Thomas
could mean that Pitt might lose out on a
local star, Dante Calabria of Blackhawk
High School in Beaver Falls. Thomas and
Calabria play similar positions (shooting
guard), and it is unlikely that Pitt would
get both players. Calabria’s coach, John
Miller, is the father of Panther point guard
Sean Miller. Currently, Calabria is
considering Villanova, Iowa and North
Carolina along with Pitt. Calabria’s father
played at Iowa in the 19603.

Pitt was among several schools recruiting

Redeaux and Thomas, but most of the
other schools were southern universities
like Arkansas, Texas and Houston.
While these early verbal commitments
are encouraging for Pitt, they may also

limit the Panthers’ ability to recruit the top
eastern prep players. Besides Calabria,
there are several players who are on the
list of many Big East schools: Forwards
Otis Hill and John Wallace are two New
Yorkers who are big prizes for any
conference team. Hill is a bruiser at 6-8
and 240 pounds. Also a football star, Hill

is a target for most of the Big East and

several Atlantic Coast Conference schools.

Wallace-is also 6-8 but is more of a
shooter than Hill, and he is not as wide. He
was named the number one player at the
B/C All-Stars Camp held this summer in
Gettysburg, Pa.. Wallace hails from
Rochester and is generally considered a
top priority for Syracuse,»although many

Penguins in danger of selling away dreams of fans

Ryan
Buncher

It seems it is too much to ask
for any professional sports team
in Pittsburgh to spend the money
to keep itself intact. The Penguins
have gone from champions intent
on keeping it together, to a
mercenary organization intending
to sell off $7 million in “assets.”

Possibilities of selling off players
have been just rumors. They
began right after the title was
won. The memories of Mario
Iemieux ﬁnally getting his name
on the Stanley Cup and goaltender
T om Barasso ﬁnally winning the
big one were still fresh. Maybe
the most vivid memory was the
childlike joy and exuberance of_
34-year-old Brian Trottier, veteran
of four Stanley Cup champions in
New York.‘ These memories
quickly became mixed in with
talk ‘of the financial problems
with keeping this team together.

First came the signing of free-
agent wingers Mark Recchi and
Kevin Stevens, center Ron Francis,
and Trottier. This was finally
accomplished, after a lot of
bickering between management
and players, with the recent
signing of Francis. Then came
talk of cutting the newly bloate
payroll. , '

Most notable in the talk of

getting rid of players was ‘

unloading defenseman Paul
Coffey and his million-plus dollar
salary. Even this was not dealing
a player for just cash: It was a
player for other players with
smaller salaries, with a distinct

possibility that the team may not I

get equal value. Few fans were
worried about this situation; the
logic was that Coffey missed most
of the playoffs with injuries, and

the team still went all the way. So

they don't need him.

This ignores the contributions
of Coffey in the regular season,
helping keep the offense going
and providing leadership in the
absence of Lemieux. In fact the
one series in which he played the
most was the ﬁrst-round matchu p
with New Jersey, which was the
toughest challenge Pittsburgh
faced in the playoffs. In addition,
Larry Murphy wouldbe the player
expected to take up the slack as
an offensive defenseman, and he
has struggled so far this season.
Most of all, despite his defensive
problems, Paul Coffey is destined
for the Hall of Fame.

Beyond the mistake it would
be to trade a quality player,
Stevens and Recchi have also

been mentioned in rumors. It

ll.Ioeoen'e Health Services“

seems that selling them off is
what is being proposed here, and
it is not only unfair to the team
and the fans, but it will probably
lead to the departure of the team
from Pittsburgh.’

Many fans believed this was a
far-off possibility with the new
ownership, led by Howard
Baldwin and Morris Belzberg, and
involving Paul Martha.

Martha was the man loyal to
Pittsburgh and the fans —— the
one who would take care of
those interests. Baldwin left
Martha out of the agreement and
then fired him as president. These
were the first outward signs of
trouble. '

Now The Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette has acquired a copy of a
letter from Baldwin to Martha,

, mentioning a plan to sell off $7

million in team assets to be put
toward the $31 million being paid
to Edward Debartolo for the team.

Lemieux said in the report in

— the Post-Gazette that even his

name had been mentioned. As a
Penguin fan, all I have to say is

 

that if they sell Mario, I become a
fan of whatever team they trade
him to.

One question is if these trades
will be for other players or just for
cash. Doing it in trades would be
like the what the Edmonton Oilers
did, beginning with trading Coffey
to Pittsburgh. They were in a
similar situation; an immensely
talented team with one seemingly
untouchable superstar, in this case
Wayne Gretzky.

Gretzky has since been
dispatched, along. with all-stars
such as goaltender Andy Moog,

Grant Fuhr (who is still all-world ‘

despite his off—ice problems), Jari
Kurri and Glenn Anderson. They
are still solid, but they are far
from the dynasty they once were.

The Penguins have a chance to
be that kind of dynasty. They are
young and extremely talented. In

addition to Lemieux, Stevens,
Recchi, Barasso and Coffey, they
have such veteran stars as Francis
and winger Joey Mullen and a
rising superstar in Jaromir Jagr.
This prime talent and a strong
supporting cast will keep the
team near the top, if they stay
together. .

Trading the players will leave

‘ the team a weakened contender.

Selling them will leave a shell of
a team. The quality players who
remain, already hurting due to
the illness of Coach Bobjohnson,
could be demoralized by such a
move.

Fans will unquestionably be
outraged by such a move and
will stay away from the Civic
Arena, especially if Lemieux
leaves. He is the reason fans
started showing up at the games
in the first place. This could lead

to the new owners leaving town
with the team as soon as ‘a
loophole in the stadium lease
will allow. _
The owners will make money.
Moving to a better market would
help them. This possibility is far
from a done deal, but losing the
team is not the issue. Wanting a
team that is worried about

winning, not saving money, is '

what is of concern now.
There is hope. Maybe the

owners won’t sell off the talent . -

on this team. Better yet, maybe
the NHL Board of Governors will
see how bad this situation looks
and deny approval of the sale.
Maybe the team can be held
together long enough to win
another championship. If not, all
fans will be left with are memories
of one magical championship run

and one very old kid having fun. A, I

schools are involved, including
Kansas, Virginia and Notre Dame.

Chris Davis is another product
of Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of
Wilson, Va. Davis transferred to
Oak Hill from Lakeland, Fla., after
last year. 1

The 6-7 forward is now a top
recruit for Miami, Clemson, Wake

-Forest and Florida State as well as

Big East schools.

Considering Pitt's recent
success in garnering Oak Hill
players (Brian Shorter, Gandhi
Jordan and Chris McNeal), Davis
becomes a possibility.

Another player who could
revive the always—exciting Pitt-
Villanova rivalry is Keith
Kurowski, a guard from New
Jersey. ‘Nova has the inside track

’ because

Kurowski plays at Christian

-Brothers Academy, the same

school that produced current
Wildcat Marc Dowdell. Notre

' Dame and Penn State also are

among those seeking Kurowski’s
services. .

Other players who Pitt has or
had an interest in (or vice versa)
include Michael Evans, a point
guard from Norfolk, Va. Evans
will most likely attend an out—of-
state school since Virginia signed
a point guard last year.

Brandon Titus is a California
native who listed Pitt among his
interests. However Pitt is the only
eastern school the 6-4 Titus is
reportedly considering.
