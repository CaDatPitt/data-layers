 Improved research gets rned school national attention

By Sandy Paul
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine was listed as one of five up—and-
coming medical schools in the nation in
the March 19 issue of U.S. News and World
Repon‘ magazine. ‘

Pitt ranked fourth among the medical
schools at University of Alabama, University
of California at San Diego, University of
Iowa and the University of Texas, Dallas.
All the schools are perceived as potential
Top 15 medical institutions in the United
States. The selections were made by deans

and heads of medical departments and
were based on the schools’ recent
innovations and improvements.

Dr. George Bernier jr., dean of Pitt’s
medical school, said, “We believe our
expanded research base, exceptional
clinical programs and planned education
innovations helped us to gain this
distinction.”

Bernier believes that, “there has been a
dramatic change. in the school’s research
base that has gained national attention,”
and, in turn, this has affected Pitt’s ranking
as an up—and—coming medical school. He
explained that grant proposals for research

funding by medical institutions are
reviewed nationally by medical colleagues
and peers to determine whether the grants
should be funded. An important factor,
Bernier said ithat the decisions are based
on these peer judgements, and apparently
Pitt’s research proposals are impressing
the national medical community.

This nationally recognized research base
reﬂects upon Pitt’s medical faculty which,
according to Bernier, is ranked as one of
the Top 20 faculties among the nation’s
medical schools. The medical professors
have been able to expand research funding

and opportunities, which has led to
tremendous advances in the areas of cancer
research, transplantation and neural
science.

While the clinical research in these three
areas at Pitt are the most prominent, the
entire clinical component of the school is,
“probably perceived nationally-as stronger
than it was 10 years ago,” Bernier said.

“It is very gratifying to know that our
school of medicine is recognized as one of
the schools having the greatest
momentum.”

Racism is a growing problem
on college campuses across the
country, including the University
of Pittsburgh. The writing is on
the wall.

Or, at least it was until
members ofthe new Pittstudent
organization Students Against
Racism began their graffiti-
erasing project Monday at
Langley Hall.

SIAR members started the
project as “one of several little

BiGALA, Amnesty work for education to end homophobia

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

Protesting the persecution of
homosexuals around the world,
the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance, in cooperation with
Amnesty International, sponsored
an information table yesterday in
the William Pitt Union.

Chuck Cox, secretary of
BiGALA, said that the table was
held to show the oppression of
homosexuals around the world.

“We are holding the table to

D‘ protest the human-rights

violations going on around the
world,” he said. “In South America
and Iran, homosexuals and

bisexuals are executed only‘

because they are gay.”

But Cox also said that there was
another motive behind the table.

“We need to increase awareness
among homosexuals,” he said. “If
there isn’t enough information
for gays and lesbians, there may
never be a cure for AIDS. We
need to speak up for health care.
AIDS affects everybody, not just
homosexuals.”

Lisa Oshop, a supporter of

BiGALA, was impressed with the
turnout at the table. “We’ve gotten
a number of signatures on the
petitions, ” she said. “At one point,
the table was jammed with
people.”

John Merritt, a member of
Amnesty International, said that
Amnesty International is
constantly helping homosexuals
around the world who are
persecuted.

“Our mandate says that no
person should be maintained

.these

because of race, religion or sexual
preference,” he said. "We handle
many cases of gays around the
world who are persecuted
because of their sexual
preference. ”

A number of petitions were
available for signing at the table,
including two which were going
to Iran and Argentina to protest
the treatment of homosexuals in
countries. Amnesty
International had several petitions
for five justices of the U.S.
Supreme Court, who voted in

favor of the death penalty.

“We are opposed to the death
penalty,” Merritt said. “We feel
that it is racially biased.” He also
said that the death penalty was
bad economically, saying, “It is
more expensive to keep a prisoner
on death row than to have him in
a regular jail cell.”

The information table was part
of Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Awareness Week. More
information tables and a BiGALA
social are planned for later this
week.

..Dorm damages can add up if students are careless

By Laurie Lehosky
Staff Writer

For many Pitt students, the end
of the semester means nothing

but studying for exams and

packing for home. However,
some students will have made a
dent in their wall, and they will
pay for it.

From the 1988-89 academic
school year, university housing
collected $11,085.89 in fines for
ﬂoor—charge damages, according
to Cynthia Matula, Meal Ticket
Office supervisor, who is also
responsible for invoice housing

Q damages.

It

The $11 ,000-plus total included
three housing units in Tower B,
one unit in Tower C, two wings
in Lothrop Hall 8 and
fraternities. According to Matula,
90 percent of the ﬂoor charges
are from males, and the vast
majority of room charges are also
from males.

Matula cited one incident which
she claims frequently happens. A
student goes out, gets drunk and
cannot get his key into the door.
The student decides to kick in the
door to get into his room.

“They didn’t mean to, but the
point is, the door needs to be
replaced. We don’t charge you
because we feel that you are
malicious,” she said.

On the back of the housing
agreement, Section 8 of the
Housing/Food Service License
Terms and Conditions states that
all students are individually
responsible for all damage done
to the living- room study areas,
the furnishings and all other

., inclusive university property.

After the damages have been
recognized, they are usually
repaired before the students are

billed, said Matula. The bill,

includes the price of the repair
and the cost of labor.

The billing process for
residence-hall ‘ damages begins
immediately after the academic

ﬂy school year. The bills for the floor

"‘ Men's cut
Women's cut  
Complete Perm
Foil Hi—lites
A 1 l0 s. Bouquet St., Oakland

and room damages are sent out
in the summer at the end of June

[W0 ‘

and the beginning of July.

Students who have been billed
for damages have approximately
two to four weeks to pay their
ﬁnes. For students who have not
paid their ﬁnes, late notices are
sent in November, and second
notices are sent in February. If
the student still refuses to pay the
fine, he or she can’t pick in the
lottery, said Matula.

“Lottery isn’t a threat if the
student lives off campus,” said

1 Matula.

A transfer—notif1cation form is
the deadline when the fine
proceeds to Special Accounts,
where a student then receives a
Not Permitted to Register form.

“With an NPR, the student can’t
register, get their grades or their
diplomas. It puts a hold on their
account,” Matula said. “Students
who have graduated tried to apply
to graduate school or to get a job,
and they can’t get their diplomas.”

Matula said the university
eventually gets 90 percent of the
money owed. .

Since the university does collect
most of the money from the
damages, what constitutes a

damage? Damages are necessary '

repairs such as changing locks
and replacing windows.
According to Matula, the
university assumes a $5 per
person damage.

For ﬂoor damages, the amount
of the damage is divided by the
number of students living on the
floor. If the amount exceeds $5,
the university will bill the students,
said Matula. ‘

“Most ﬂoors never receive a
bill,” Matula said.

In the Towers, housing
considers the elevator ﬂoor and
the floors above and below a
three-ﬂoor housing unit because
the students have access to all
three" ﬂoors, said Matula.

Of the number of created
damages, one favorite student-
created act is to penny security
doors. Students put pennies on
the opposite.side of the lock, so
they won’t need to use their key.
This jams the door, and it will not

lock.

Last year, one housing unit in
Tower B, floors 5, 6 and 7, had
damages accumulating to
approximately $27 each for 111
people, said Matula. According
to Matula, those floors pennied
the doors in, threw their lounge
TV out of a window and caught
an 8-foot section of carpeting on
fire.

What were the reasons for this
vandalism? Students said the color
wasn’t right on the television,
said Matula.,The students also
put lighter fluid on the carpet
because the carpet in the
residence halls is inflammable.

Matula said she perceives. that
the damages in the Towers are
due to the sheer number of people
living together in such close
proximity.

In the Towers, housing usually
puts the athletes on the lower
floors. “Therelisl a great number
of athletes who live on campus.
The bigger you are, the more
damage you can do. I’m not
saying [the athletes] are
malicious,” Matula said.

' Water coolers and urinals being
knocked off the wall are some of
the unusual damages that occur.
Matula said this usually happens
on the athletes’ floors.

Other frequently damaged
objects are the smoke detectors.
Matula said the smoke detectors
in the dorms are not the kind one

can buy in a hardware store.‘

“Each smoke detector is wired
into Oakland’s fire station. It costs
lots of money [for repairs] lzach
time one is torn down,” said
Matula.

“If someone would knock
down a smoke detector in the
hallway, it would cost the entire
floor, unless [the housing ofﬁcel
knew who did it,” said senior
Glenn Schneider, a McCormick
Hall resident assistant.

Matula advises students to tell
if they know who is responsible
for the damages. “If you
didn’t destroy something, it is to
your advantage to tell who did
it,” Schneider said. i

In comparing floor and room
charges, Matula said, “Room
charges are nowhere near as
much as floor charges.”

She stressed the importance of
paying attention to room-

condition reports when filling

them out. At the end of the year,

Maintenance checks the reports

Mikhail Nikolaevich Kuraev has been a professional writer of film scripts
The publication of his first noveila, about the
Kronstadt uprising —— "Captain Dikshtein: A Fantastic Narrative” (  IX,
1987) -- attracted international attention because of its ironic tone, digressive
structure, and playfulness with language. He was hailed as one of the new and
most promising voices in contemporary Soviet literature.

Kuraev‘s second novella -—"Night Patrol:
[Gogol's and Stalin's] with the Participation of a Rifleman of the Militarized Guard.
Comrade Polubolotov [Semi-Swampl" (Nogi mir XII, 1988) -- confirmed his
status as a master story teller of the Leningrad tradition.
through the view of one of the innumerable NKVD "night knockers, searchers,
and arresters." It was widely praised in the Soviet. emigre. and Western press.

Roach said, “God, it’s

It's one of the biggest charity

Match Group Three, which
consisted of Alpha Epsilon Pi,

was not permitted to run in the
race because they were unable to
make the dry run last Sunday due
to a broken axle on their chariot.

met the safety regulations.”

Peace Coigos experience

Althoughiit has been four years
since he walked the dirt roads
where everyone knew his name
and awakened to the sound of
elephants stomping through the
fields of mango and papaya trees
growing in front of his bedroom
window, Shawn Wright still
misses Zaire and the friends he
left behind.

“I loved the job,” Wright said of
the two years he spent working
in the Peace Corps. “It’s the best
job I ever had.”

While most college students go
to counselors to help them find
the career that is right for them,
Wright went to Africa.

Wright is back now. The two
years he spent as a Peace Corps
recruit ended in 1985, but the
influence Zaire had on his life is
as strong as it was the day he
returned.

He is now the Peace Corps
recruiter at the University of
Pittsburgh. Wright received a
master’s degree in public health
when he returned but now studies

\ law at Pitt in hopes of attaining a
career goal formulated by his ,.

Peace Corps experience.

“I’d like to be a legislative aide
to a congressman doing work on
international health or policy
issues,” Wright said. “There are a
lot of people in the [United States]
who do not receive proper health
benefits, and I would like to have
a part in the creation of legislation

that would correct this problem.” egg 

Wright wasn’t interested in the
health ﬁeld before he went to
Zaire. Graduating from college
as a history major, he knew very
little about the health profession,

but that was not important to the

Peace Corps, which was more
interested in his organizational
skills and his ability to lead. It

was his previous involvement in an I

student groups and community
projects that made him a valuable
asset.

foolish when they assigned
Wright to a job dealing with
community health problems. He
did not administer medication or
mend broken bones.

More definition for student athlete

The student athlete is a title
with little or no substance.

Students at the University of
Pittsburgh do not have a great
deal of respect for the so—called
student athletes at our school.
Students do not believe that the
members of our basketball and
football teams are receiving or
earning a decent education at
Pitt. Perhaps it is time for our
university and many other uni-
versities across the nation to stop
pretending and to change the
entire educational system for
athletes, particularly those on the
basketball and football teams.

The NCAA has discussed
changing the system of colle-
giate athletics so that the athletes
would be paid certain wages and
given athletic degrees from their
respective schools. In discussing
this system, the NCAA has hoped
to eliminate unethical behavior
and regulations violations by
schools that act inappropriately
to improve their teams. The in-
creases in violations at colleges

in the last four years have.

prompted these possible changes.

The massive failure of savings
and loans has been a big topic in
the news for quite some time.
Judging by what is generally
shown by the, mass media, it
would seem that this failure was

caused by a lack of government -

regulation. 1, however, have a
different opinion. The S&L crisis

did not happen because of too .

little government intervention; it

happened because there was, .

and is, too much government
intervention. ,

The Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corporation is a gov-
ernment-run insurance program
for the S&Ls. Every S&L \“contrib-
utes” (it’s not really a contribu-
tion; as it is required by law, I
would call it a tax) into a fund
that, if an S&L fails, is to be used
to pay for the failure. Thus, the
S&Ls can be as risky-as they want
‘with their depositors’ money, and
if they lose it all, they will be
reimbursed for it.

Risky investments often have
huge proﬁt potentials. Under

normal circumstances, the ‘S&Ls -

would have to be careful not to
lose all of their money in such
risky «ventures. Of course, the
present circumstances are not
normal ones. Because the S&Ls
have government insurance, they
make all sorts of risky ‘invest-
ments that they would otherwise
never make.

Not every S&L takes high risks
with its money. Some of them are

actually quite sound However,‘

regardless of the level of risk

While paying athletes to come
to colleges to earn degrees in
athletics may seem ridiculous, it
may be the only way to end the
controversies surrounding colle-

giate sports. At least students
would not feel cheated as a result
of the stories and rumors that
they hear about cheating in
school, fixed grades, special treat-
ment and special gifts. While
university sports teams do bring
in a lot of revenue for their schools
—-— and they do bolster school

Government guilty in

the fee paid to the FSLIC is still

In short, the S&Ls that are risky
with their money are given bail-
outs, while those who play it safe

Alman

with their money are forced to
pay for these bailouts. The bad
behavior is rewarded, and the
good behavior is punished. It
does not take a degree in psy-
chology to figure out what incen-
tives this will create. Simply put,
the main reason for the S&L fi-
asco is that the government en-
courages the S&Ls to behave irre-
sponsibly. Abolishing the FSLIC
would end this practice.

Of course, people who have

A their money deposited in S&Ls
" do want to know that their money

is safe. Private insurance would
be a good way of accomplishing

With private insurance, any S&L
that is being risky with its deposi-
tors’ money would see its insur-

spirit among the schools’ stu-
dents and alumni — the rumors
of corruption within the athletic
departments of colleges affect
the attitudes of everyone about
their schools.

Students do not believe in the
system. They do not have faith in
how their schools are run. Per-
haps if the rumors were put to
rest, the secrecy ended and col-
legiate sports made more profes-
sional and less amateur, then
everyone would be satisfied with
a system that did not pretend to
be something that it is not.

‘We are sick of the denials and
the proclamations of ethical
behavior. Students at Pitt and
other universities know what
goes on, even if the athletic
departments and the administra-
tions do not think they do. So
why don’t we stop pretending
and change the system to some-
thing that we can all understand
and believe in? The “student
athlete” needs to be a term that
has some real meaning.

David W. Marta is a columnist
for The Pitt News.

S&L ﬁasco

ance premiums skyrocket. This

V would discourage S&Ls from
taking so many risks. Meanwhile,
those that were well-behaved
would not be punished for the
actions of other S&Ls.

Right now, some government
officials want to use the per-
sonal income tax as a source of
money to pay for the S&L bail-
out because the fees paid by the
S&Ls can’t cover the present
mess that exists. Those govern-
ment officials are total idiots.
They think that innocent tax-
payers should be punished for
someone else’s wrongdoing.

This idea is just as bad‘ as the .

current situation, in which inno-
cent S&Ls are punished for the
actions of other S&Ls. The only
difference is that if taxpayers are
forced to pay for the bailout, this
will, hopefully, make them sit up
and take notice. Then, maybe
they will call for an end to gov-
ernment-run insurance of the
S&Ls.

The main reason that so many
S&Ls are failing is because the
government is paying them to
fail. It is similar to a gambler who
loses all of his money, only to be
reimbursed by the government
at the taxpayers’ expense. In
both cases, the government is
forcing one party to take respon-
sibility for the actions of another.
This has no place in a free soci-

ety.

"Running ” the 5K

It has now been over a week since I ran in the five- kilometer
race that kicked off Engineers’ Week a couple of Sundays ago.
It has taken the post-race pain this long to finally vacate my legs.
I wanted to forget the whole ordeal, but my therapist told me
the best way to get it all behind me would be to write about it.

When my friend Ross showed me the bulletin advertising the
SK run that was to take place on March 18, I was all for it. I con-
sidered myself ﬁt. “Hell,” I thought, “five kilometers, that’s like
the 50-yard dash, right?” (My school district, run by fundamen-
talists, outlawed the metric system, along with the theories of
Darwin and Copernicus, as being Communist.) Ross and I had
a week to train for this grueling test of our manhood. For drills,
we decided to take the stairs instead of the elevator to our
fourth-ﬂoor dorm rooms. We cut back on our Little Debbie
snack—cake consumption (from three boxes a week down to
one) and looked at pictures
of women to inspire us.
Ross looked at Marla
Maples; I looked at Little
Debbie.

Sunday morning came
sooner than expected. It
had been eight months or
so since Ross competed in
a race. The last time I ran
for more than 10 seconds
was when I tried to sell
lucky rabbits’ feet to ani-
mal-rights fanatics. Luckily,
most of them had chained
themselves to a furrier, or
they would have caught me.

Anyway, there we were amongst the rabble of true runners.
I thought dress was optional. I had on shorts, a T-shirt and
running shoes. I soon found myself surfing in waves of
Spandex. Spandex looks great on young athletic women.
Spandex looks oleay on middle-aged women. Spandex should
be outlawed among women with gray hair and sagging rear
bumpers. Before the race started, people warmed up. Some
exercised, some ate bananas, some meditated. Ross and I
rationalized quitting.

“Look,” I said, “if we run now, we might injure ourselves. We
wouldn’t possibly be in shape for the Pittsburgh Marathon.”

“'Ihat’s true,” Ross agreed. “Besides, five kilometers is not
really tough enough for me. I thought this was a 10K run.”

“Oh yeah?” I said. “Well, I thought this was 15  no  20
kilometers. We'll just be wasting our time with this scrub event."

We were all ready to desert when, upon witnessing the “Laws
of Spandex on Beautiful Women” jostling into action, we
decided to tough it out. Ross and I decided to go to the very end
of the line when the runners lined up for the race’s start. Our
philosophy was that if we started out last, then no one could
pass us. Ergo, we couldn’t lose. .

The race began deceptively well for us. The first mile or so
was all downhill. We ran at a brisk, smooth pace. We even
passed some people. I had nightmares before the race about
losing to old people. I ran in a 5K race my freshman year. I knew
I was in trouble when an old man with a bald head and a neck
brace zoomed by me going up a hill. “N0 Mas./”I told Ross.

Our pace continued to be smooth. It gave us great pleasure
to pass two fraternity brothers who had treated the first few
minutes of the race like it was the 100-yard dash and were now
walking the rest of the way, holding their sides. The last mile,
uphill, was the killer. We started _losing our strength. Some guy
with a walker was gaining, on us. We did finish the race, but it
took us almost 27 minutes to do it. Hey, I’m sure thernine-minute
mile was a record at some time in ancient Olympic history.

When I told people that I had run in the SK, all they were
concerned about was my time and how I ranked. I tried to
explain that just competing was the important part. They didn’t
buy it. I tried to brag to my girlfriend, hoping for a sympathetic

 

Mario
Oliverio

ear. I told her about the cold weather, the impossible hills, and

my triumph over the guy with the walker. “That's nice,” she said,
“but how did you place?” I didn’t answer. I went straight to my
room, removed the picture of her I had on my shelf and replaced
it with one of Little Debbie. I'm sure she would've understood.

recruited men and women to
become health leaders. They went
back to their hometowns and
stressed the importance of
immunization to others.

“Kids were dying of measles,”
Wright said. “It wasn’t unusual to
have two of three kids die in a
single family, but this is [now]
improving, as countries improve
their immunization rates.”

Before Wright left Zaire, he
trained over 70 people in basic

included the subject of
immunization, but also the
importance of family planning
and pre— and post-natal care.
These people have gone on to

Some of Wright’s fondest
memories are the comical
situations that arose from his
cross-cultural experience.

“I was invited to as local church

said. “People were really open
and wanted to make me"feel at

, home, so they thought I’d want

to go to church.

“I got there and met the pastor
and a few other leaders in the
church. They sat me down, facing
the entire congregation in a chair
by myself. The church was entirely
empty.

“I thought, ‘This is just
temporary. I'm going to be here
for a minute or two, obviously,
because this isn’t the place for
[just anybodyl to sit; this is la

place] for a leader to sit.’ One
chorus filed in singing, another
chorus filed in, a third chorus
and suddenly the place was
starting to get very packed. People
were raring to go.

‘‘I [was] still sitting in this chair!
The place was entirely packed.
The pastor walked in and

assumed his position right next I

to me, and that’s the way the
service proceeded for three hours.
It was fun.”

The worst part was when
Wright’s turn came to stand and
tell everyone his name and what
he was doing in Zaire. It wasn’t
an unpleasant experience for him;
instead, it was awkward. His skill
in Lingala, the native language of
the congregation, was not yet
perfected.

“l haltingly said a few words;
my name, I got that right; where
I was from, the United States, got
that right; and what I was doing,”
Wright said. “There was absolute
silence [with] everybody wanting
to know what I was like.
Afterwards, as I sat down, I
looked, and the people were
beaming, really happy that I had
been able to come.”

He has made it his responsibility
to help any foreign person at the
university in any way he can. The
respect the Zairean people had
for him is the reason for this.
Wright said, ‘‘I just like to, in a
small way, pay back to the rest of
the world what they have done
for me.”

Damage
Continued from page 3
and compares them to the rooms.

“If the student wrote on the
report that paint was chipped
and there was scribbling on the
wall, we won’t charge them,”
Matula said.

Damages are observed
carefully, and inventory checks
are just as important. Every
furnishing in the residence halls
is bar—coded due to the large
number of items. “Inventory is
important when you have this
many furnishings,” she said.

‘ According to Matula, ifa piece
offurniture is missing, the student

will be charged for that specific
piece. Matula said ifthe furniture
is eventually found, it still costs
the student because in addition
to the labor of university
personnel, the ‘computer time
and the computer operator must
also be accounted for in their
work in searching for the missing
piece and finding out where it
belongs. /I .
If a student is fined, he or she
can appeal the fine. Floor charges
are not appealable, but room
charges can be appealed.
“Occasionally we do make
mistakes,” Matula said.

SimpsonmissesAll-American status by four points

By Geoff Moskowitz
Staff Writer

All-American statuseluded Pitt
wrestlers Bob Simpson and Alan
Utter this past weekend at the
NCAA Championships held in

7 College Park, Md.

Simpson, at 126 pounds,

finished four points shy of

qualifying as an All-American,
losing to last year’s runner—up
Doug Wyland, 7-3. Wyland
. helped‘ his University of North
Carolina squad nestle a 16th-
place ﬁnish between Eastern

Wrestling League members
Clarion (1 5), Lehigh (17) and West
Virginia (18).

“Bobby wrestled a good
tournament, but his match score
doesn't show that,” said Utter.

Wyland was awarded three

backpoints at the end of the match ‘

to ice the victory.

Oklahoma State’s Tony Purler
also contributed to Simpson’s
elimination. Purler, ranked 10th
in the nation at 126 pounds, beat
Simpson 10-5, adding to the
Cowboys’ No. 1 ﬁnish in the
tournament.

PAGE 10

Simpson said he wrestled pretty
well but was disappointed that he
was just one match away from
becoming an All-American.

“I’m going to wrestle freestyle
this summer and try to get better
for next year,” he said.

Simpson will return next season
as an established force in the
EWL and will continue his
leadership role as a junior on the
Pitt team. Utter will not be
returning.

“It’s time for a rest,” said Utter.
“My eligibility is up, and I'm
working on my master’s degree

in exercise physiology. I haven't
really decided if I'm going to
wrestle freestyle this summer yet
or not.”

Utter said he's going to pursue
a career in cardiac rehabilitation.

Utter added he didn’t do too
well in the NCAA championship
tournament, losing to Oklahoma
State’s ﬁfth-seeded Chuck Barby
in the first round.

EWL wrestlers dominated the
heavier weights at the tournament.
Lehigh’s. Matt Ruppel beat Iowa's
Brooks Simpson, 6-feet-5-inches
and 190 pounds, to win Lehigh’s

18th national championship.
Ruppel, a Montana native and a
business major carrying a 3.8
grade-point average, said Lehigh’s
wrestling program is on the
rebound.

At heavyweight, Clarion
University’s Kurt Angle defeated
Penn State’s Greg Haladay 3-1 to
secure a national championship.
Haladay’s runner-up performance
helped the Nittany Lion’s ﬁnish
sixth overall at the tournament.

Bloomsburg rounded out the
EWL field, tying for 21st with
Stanford and Wisconsin.

.Men gymnasts end season with third place at N .I.C.C.

 Sharon Kerestes
Staff writer

The Pitt men's gymnastics team
ended its season on a high note
‘ with a third—place ﬁnish at the
‘ National Independent College
Championships at Kent State
Saturday. The team scored 266.75,
the highest a Panther squad has
~ scored in eight years, and upped
its record to 10-7.
. i Pitt finished behind Kent State
{ (269.50) and Illinois-Chicago
(269.15). Northern Illinois (263.55)
‘Jplaced fourth, followed by the
,_:r_,Ai.r Force Academy (262.15),
William and Mary (256.70) and
I }.:Western Michigan (255.45).
’_ The Panthers improved their
"team scores considerably from
 regular season on each event.’

  

 had the highest team score
an vault (44.95) and the third best
on ﬂoor exercise (46.1 5) and rings
(44.00).

“We had a peak performance,”
Pitt Coach Frank D’Amico said. “I
couldn’t have asked for anything
better.”

The highlight of the meet was

their last event —- ﬂoor exercise. —

Brock; Freehling scored 9.4 and
placed fifth, high enough to
qualify for ﬁnals. Pat Pollaci, Chris
O’Loughlin, Kyle MacBeth and
Dave Bausmith followed his lead;
all four scored above 9.0.

“We » started the meet on
pommels and did a good job
there,” D’Amico said. “Then things
just kept picking up. It went from

L event to event with the ﬁnale on
floor.”

 was the first time D’Amico

Stuart Yoss and the rest of the Panthers concluded their season with a strong performance at nationals.

has taken a team to a national
meet. But he said that although
the competition was very good
and other teams had higher
averages going into the meet, Pitt
was able to keep pace because of
its depth.

“The first few men on every
team had 9.65 and 9.75. But their

last guy was 8.5, and my last guy
was 9.0. That was the difference,”
he said. ,

Pitt fared well individually, with
four gymnasts placing in finals.
Damon DiFabio ﬁnished fourth
on parallelbars; Bausmith ﬁnished
sixth on rings; Pollaci was sixth
on high bar and Freehling was

fifth on floor.

Pollaci scored 54.50 and placed
fourth in the all-around
competition. Bausmith (53.45)
and Freehling(52.90)»eachscored
career highs and ﬁnished ninth
and-1 11th, respectively.

The season isn’t oflicially over
for all the gymnasts yet. A few

Jason Hillman/T he Pitt News

still have a chance of qualifying
for the NCAA Regional Meet on
April 7 at Penn State.

Pollaci, for one, still has hopes
of qualifying in the all-around,
but this meet was his last chance
to compete with other team
members.  ’

Absolutely no way instant replay could work in bas/eetball

It is December 1991. Indiana
and Georgia Tech have just
broken the record for the longest
college-basketball game in history
without overtime. It hasjust taken
17 hours and 43 minutes to play
40 minutes of regulation
basketball.

Twenty—nine of the original
17,357 customers present at tipoff
still remain cramped in their seats.
Tech’s Bobby Cremins is
catnapping in the coaches’ box.
Bobby Knight is actually sitting
down in his chair. A mere 0:11.6
remains on the scoreboard clock,
and the score is tied.

Hoosier sophomore» Damon
Bailey has just collided with Tech’s
Kenny Anderson as the Indiana
guard, drives to the basket." A
whistle blows, and a referee
signals charging Knight, now
too exhausted to stand, his voice
gone, in a roaring whisper blasts

the officials from his chair.‘

“What?!! You blind $#!%’@!!. He’s
moving in on him!!”

The three officials convene at
midcourt.

“It looked to me like Anderson
had his ground.”

“I don’t know, Hal. Knight may
have a point. From my angle he

moved in under Bailey. Still sliding
a bit. What do you think, Grady?"
“Tough one- I was kinda

 

shielded from the play. I guess
we have no other choice. Let’s
send it up to  THE REPLAY
BOOTH.”

" With that decision,a'new NCAA
record has also been broken -
most instant-replay reviews in
regulation play, 372.

Eleven minutes pass before the
decision is relayed to courtside.

“Tough to say, gentlemen 
(yawn)  Uh, we've got 16
different angles. Eight say charge,
six "say blocking, and two say
backcourt. Inconclusive.”

“Aﬂerfurtber review, the play

' did indeed occur. ”

The delirious home crowd
offers only a gentle boo in
response, for this has gone way
beyond the realm of college

* basketball as a sport; it is now a
V a form of real-life Nintendo.

Just when you thought that
basketball was in the safe hands
of Dick Vitale and The Laker
Girls, a new menace may be
readying to fix something that
isn’t quite broken, only a little
dirty in some places.

Instant replay in college
basketball. Or, more
appropriately, instant replay in
college basketball??

Well, with this sudden surge in
the amount of unbelievably close
matchups and buzzer-shaving

- Jorgensen stars as Pitt
takes ﬁfth at E.C.A.C.C.

By John Labriola
Staff Writer

The Lady Panther gymnastics team placed fifth with a score of

181.70 this pastweekend at the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Confe.,r,e,nce
Championships held at Northeastern University. Pitt’s Karenjorgensen
tied Tina Taylor’s school—record floor score of 9.60.
_ “We didn’t perform badly, but overall I was disappointed that we
didn’t finish stronger, and that was mostly due to our bars,” said head
coach Debbie Yohman. “The final result was due to our bar
performance. I think that everybody was just a little upset.”

The entire Pitt squad turned in bar scores of 8.4 and above. High
scores were turned in by Kristen Brown (9.25), Kathy Wallish (9.05),
and Beth Dyson (8.95). _

The Lady Panthers turned in strong vaulting scores for a total of
45.60. High scores were earned by Gina Venezia (9.25), Dyson (9.25),
Shelly Sleith (9.15), Taylor (8.95) and Brown (8.80).

In addition, the Lady Panthers turned in excellent beam performances
to score a 45.75.

“We were a little cautious on beam. Everyone except for [Dyson]
had a loss of balance near the end of the routines,” added Yohman.

Small Conferences lack the big win

Although I must admit this
has been one of the most
exciting college—basketba1l
tournaments in many years, with
the close games and upsets,
there is something to keep in
mind. No matter how many
thrilling victories we get from
unsung teams such as Ball State
and Xavier, in the end it seems
to always be the top teams from
the major conferences who go
on to the Final Four and win it
all.

A look back at national
champions from the 19805
shows that three winners were
from the Big 10 Conference
(Indiana twice and Michigan),
two from the Big East

(Georgetown and Vi1lanova),—

two from the Atlantic Coast
Conference (North Carolina
and North Carolina State), two
from the Metro Conference
(Louisville twice) and one from

 

the Big 8 (Kansas).

It is fun to watch teams from
conferences such as the Big
Sky, Mid-American and the Big
Deal add to the excitement of
March Madness, but until I see

one of them cutting down the
nets after winning it all, I won’t
be convinced that they belong
in the tournament. A
While I haven’t fully figured
out my plans for the way the
tournament should be run, my
rough ideas consist of having
the teams from the Top 20, in
addition to almost all of the
teams from the major
conferences (Big East, Big 10,
Big 8, ACC,-etc). Pitt’s near-
victory over Syracuse in the Big
East Tournament who went on
to the Sweet 16 showed that
they would be more of a
worthwhile competitor in the
field of 64 than teams like
Southwest Missouri State and
See Notes, page 13

Yohman also said that it seemed as though the girls were
concentrating too much on their routines and not allowing them to
flow.

High scores for the Lady Panthers were turned in by Dyson (9.25),
Venezia (9.20), Taylor (9.15), Wallish (9.10) and Borchers (9.05).

The floor events are a strong point for Pitt, and the Lady Panthers
turned in good performances to earn a total of 46.55. The Lady
Panthers did, however, experience some difficulty with Notheastern’s
sound system.

Yohman said that the system they used either played the music too
quickly, too slowly or inaudibly. Venezia,‘ Yohman explained, has a
hearing disorder and needs to hear the bass in her music.

Yohman also said that after she had explained this to the judges,
they permitted Brown to cue Venezia.

“Gina’s could have been a problem, but Kristen was able to cue her,
and she worked real well,” said Yohman. “She could have gotten
nervous about not being able to hear the music, but she did her floor

' like shenormally did. [For] the two crucial spots, the beginning and .5
the middle, she had a cue as to when to go." , »

T owson University won the championships with a score of 188.85.
Northeastern University placed second with 185.60 points. The

”rerr‘iainder“of the field was as follows: third, University of 
Hampshire (184.50); fourth, the College of William and Mary (183.65)
and placing sixth was James Madison University (178.90). V '5

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, March 28, 1990

Replay
Continued from page 10
endings that this latest NCAA
tournament has politely conjured
up in exchange for CBS’s
abracadillions, some of the calls
have been just a little too close
for some people's liking, and
replay has suddenly become

something of an issue.
Or, as Michigan State Coach
Jud Heathcote, whose team’s

demise in the Sweet 16 was

basket

prompted by a controversial
by Anderson a
microsecond after the ﬁnal buzzer,
stated, “In crucial games, I’m not

so sure we shouldn’t be using

/

    PIT T

replay, because you've got an
awful lot at stake here in a game
like this.” I assume Jud is talking
about money here, not free sodas
after each game.

Heathcote, who also happens
to be the president of the National

If

Association of Basketball Coaches,
may look to pursue an
implementation of some sort of
replay system. “Again, there’s so
much at stake. The players work
so hard to get this far [into the
tournament]. We should do
everything possible to make things
fair.”

Clem Haskins of Minnesota,
whose team luckily avoided any
direct ﬁnal-second controversy
in the tournament, sympathized
with Heathcote. “I feel the game
has become a big business. I
don’t particularly like that, but
there is just too much at stake for
a [referee] to miss a Call. There’s
too much money for a conference
or a school to lose. lt’s sad to say,
but that’s a fact of life.

“We need to go back at replays
and look at them.”

Look for what? Look at last-

second shots alone? Look to see
if the shooter was really beyond
the three-point line? Review to
see if the shooter was fouled on
the play? Lane violations?
Travelling? Hey, is this seriously
going to become an issue?Is there
realistically a place for instant
replay in the game of basketball?

Where does one draw the line
in its usage? And when? Is a shot
that may have been taken on the
three-point line instead of beyond
subject to review if it’s taken with
1:01 in the game instead of0:01.5?
Or 0:00.83? What if it went up
with 6:30 to play? Is the last-
second call always the most crucial
to a game’s outcome?

The idea, as serious as it may
be, is beyond ridiculous.

“Really, this last-second
controversy is only a problem
when it’s a tight game,” said West

“And 99 percent of the time, you

were worried about whether it
was a three-pointer or not,
because if it is, Tech wins the
game.

"In those [last-second]
situations, what is really being
magniﬁed, the closeness of the
game or the officiating?”

Television has really added
gasoline to the fire. CBS, by
breaking down every last-second
shot every possible way a
thousand times Over, has made
the deepest technological analysis
of these plays that ‘ televised
college basketball has ever seen.

But just because the technology
is available, does that make it
necessary?

Should that last shot have
counted? What do you thinle, Milee

Francesa? Watch the release, and
listen forthe buzzer. Did UConn 3
Tate George actually catch a
court-length pass, turn around
and release a jumper in less than
one second? '

“How can you [distinguish] a
tenth of a second?” said Cremins.
“You tell me the Connecticut shot
was good? How can a guy catch
the ball, turn and shoot all in
tenths of a second? It was close;
he made the shot; leave it alone.”

Heathcote’s own splendid
guard, Steve Smith, said it
beautifully, even in defeat, when
asked about Anderson’s shot.
“You make a shot like that, the ref
has to give it to you. We still had
the overtime to win it.”

“Basketball is not like football,
where you stop after every play,”
said Robert Morris Coach Jarrett
Durham. “lt’s a ﬂuid game, and
bad calls are part of the game. If
you start using a replay, where
could you realistically draw the

Notes

Continued from page 11
Towson State.

With this in mind, it is time for
me to determine the national
champion. UNLV won’t win it,
because even though they are a
very talented team, a squad from
the Big West, formerly known as
the Pacific Coast Athletic
Association, shouldn’t be the
champ.

0 Quick, name three players on
the Arkansas basketball team. I’ll
bet you couldn’t do it. Until I
watched Arkansas play Texas on
Saturday, I didn’t even know the
Southwest Conference had
basketball. If Arkansas plays Texas
in a big game, it should be to
determine who goes to the Cotton
Bowl, not the Final Four.

I have now set up my title game
between Georgia Tech and Duke,
two ACC teams. Since I have
Georgia Tech winning it all in
Bosak’s Apartment Pool, I will
have to pick them to win it all in

what could prove to be a great
matchup.

0 While I’m on the subject of
Duke and the Final Four, I feel
some credit should be given to
the Blue Devils. Not so much for
going to the Final Four, four out
of the past five years, but for their
conduct off the court. This is a
team that has had success, in
addition to every player under
Coach Mike Krzyzewski receiving
his diploma. They have also never
been linked to any investigations
or scandals that seem to have
become an accepted part of
sports.

It should be pointed out that
no Big East team has ever been
put under investigation. While
there were some rumblings about
the Syracuse program a few weeks
ago, it seems to have quieted
down very quickly.

I’ll have to jump back to Duke
for a minute to endorse Coach K.
as the next Olympic coach. The

line? I don’t know how you could

justify installing it.”

Announcer Myron Cope, a rabid
opponent of the NFL’s replay
system, thinks college basketball
would be foolish to even consider
using it. ' A

“They’re asking fora headache,

V asking for troubles with this,”

said Cope. “What’s gonna happen
is that at the end of a game, they’ll
be reviewing a shot, and everyone
in the stands will be sitting there
for five minutes waiting for the
decision, and then they’ll
announce ‘so-and—so wins.’
, They’d have a riot on their hands."

“If they want to do something,”
said Durham, “maybe they could
use the fourth official that is

present at games to specifically‘

be in charge of watching last-
second shots. There are three
officials out there doing the whole
game. The fourth at the scorers’
table could specifically have that
responsibility.”

“You’re always going to have
the human element,” said Brown,
“and the refs usually do a great
job. Using thatextra official could
be a good idea, but really, this
thing isn’t that big of a problem.
I really think it's being blown out
of proportion.” A

experts seem to say that it is
between him and Arizona Coach
Lute Olson. Krzyzewski’s record
speaks for itself. Besides, a
basketball team representing our
country should never be led by a
man named ‘'Lute.’’

- I will close my thoughts on
college basketball by predicting
that Larry Brown will be coaching
NC. State next season. He has
been with the San Antonio Spurs
for three years, which is an
eternity for him. As the New
jersey Nets can tell you, he likes
to leave young, up-and—coming
teams; therefore, a big—time
college job such as coaching the
Wolfpack seems perfect for him.

0 It appears as though the
Penguins will‘ probably make the
playoffs, even though it seems as
though they haven’t won a road
game this decade. Maybe they
haven’t; I’ll have to check. It
seems kind of ridiculous to play
an 80-game schedule every year

just for the purpose of eliminating
the Quebec Nordiques and four
other teams. The Penguins’ play
of late is not the kind of
performance we should see from
a team participating in the
postseason.

The 80 games being wrapped
up now should be referred to-as
the exhibition season, with what
is now called the playoffs being
known as the regular season. If
you’re going to let 16 teams in,
you might as well let all 21 in.
Make that 20. I can’t let Quebec
in, even though they are a mere
50 points behind fourth—place
Hartford.

0 Now that the billionaire
owners and the million-dollar
players have settled things, the
umpires threatened to leave for
the remainder of spring training.
They agreed to return to the
diamond by the end of the week,

but they should be commended
for their actions, since nobody
ever thinks about them while
fighting over what is considered
pennies to owners and players.
They forget that without the men
in blue, their agreements,
arbitration and collective
bargaining would be
meaningless. It was generous of
the umpires to even agree to
show up on opening day.
