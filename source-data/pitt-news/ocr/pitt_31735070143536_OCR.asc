effort to ‘halt crime in Oakland.

and one supervisor from both
the city and University squads
to patrol the streets of Oakland.

The officers will be in areas
where crime and nuisance tend

to be a problem and work in tan— .

dem with the regularly sched-
uled officers for those areas,
said.Delaney.

The same tactic was used
in the past to combat waves of

‘We used this tactic years

C)nline courses

sparking debate

by Dan Fiore
Staﬂ Writer

Sue Alman’s daughter won’t take online classes

‘ ‘I never see her without a cell phone or laptop,’ ’
said Alman, the director of Distance Education
and Outreach Services at Pitt ‘,‘But she won’t go
near an online class’ ’

As W/eb—based courses become more readily
available at colleges and universities nationwide,
students like Alman’s daughter are  to
realize that while online learning makes courses

said Donehue

“You have to be a stronger studen ” said
Donehue ‘.‘You have to be better organized. You

become involved in a discussion,” said Alman

This assumption hasialways been at the heart of
the argument against online learning, said Alman
For many skeptics, online learning’s effect on a
student pales in comparison to in—person settings

“There are stereotypes that people _ feel, [like]
‘Oh, online can’t possibly be as good as face to
face,” said Gaea l einhardt of Pitts Learning’
Research and Development Center. “I think that’s
the wrong direction to think about it’ ’ A

In fact,  to Ross Donehue, chairman
of the e—leaming committee for the Pittsburgh
Council of Higher Education and interim director
of distance learning for the Community College of
Allegheny County, older students who didn’t grow
up with Web technology respond better to online
learning than younger ﬁreshman or sophomore
students It all comes down to  ‘

“That’s huge,” said Donehue. ‘The technology
is nothing” '

The maturity and self—r_notivation of older
students drives their success, whereas younger

students arerftused to the independent

style,saidDonehue.

AstudybytheUStNationalCent:erfor

hard it is to develop a  online course

“To designa good online course is harder than
 a good textbook” said Leinhardt “And
writingagoodtextbooktakes severalyears Soit’s
very hard and very costiy.’ ’ _

But Leinhardt believes online learning does
have potential beneﬁts some faoe-to-face 
can’t offer: 1

"With most universities there are a number of
face—to—face classes with 100 to even 300 students
These larger classes often relyupon multiple—choice
assignments’ graded by teaching assistants who are
“modestiy supervised” by the actual instructor
The most interaction students  get from
these courses is duringrecitationwith thetieaching

Alman’s graduate online program at Pitt uses

4 i V P . the same professors for the online courses as their
' i . lace-to—face counterparts This, Alman said, ensures
‘ i | - the content is the same. It’s the same assignments

 

and same presentation materials, just a different
delivery M P

Megan Hafer, a fourth-year nursing student at
Pitt, had to take an online course last year;

i N _ p  1 L   Hafer’s  course, Introduction to 
‘Xi  i  ‘   ' "    Nurse  and Forensic Nursing, was only
« i . offered as a “hybrid” course —— four face—to—ﬁce

classes throughout the semester, two of which
were tests, and the rest of the classes taught strictly
through online material. ‘ ,

ButtoHafer, the class’s lack of personalin
with the professor and unregimented structure
made the class less valuable than a traditional class

“I wasn’t attending lectures and  notes,”
said I-lafer. “So I wasn’t looking at the material
weeklyorthinkingaboutitonaregularbasisAlso,
the learning materials were mainly PowerPoint
slides, a few articles and the book, which sometimes
couldn’t cover the material as well as I feel a real
person could have.”

I BothHaferandAlmansaidthissetupwas
most likely the  choice. But this lack of
structure is at the root of the argument against
online learning, said Alrnan.

Pitt’s Laudato said lack of structure and
regimented assignments can certainly lead to
laggingwork ethic from students

“Humans  humans,” said Laudato, “we V
tend to procrastinate with things that don’t need to

. be  clone and do the  that’s 
atusrightnowtobedone.” \ '

This causes some students to put off 
materials or wait to do assignments until the last
minute. .

“Unless assignments /are due every week, the
students can wait weeks at a time until- something
is due and then just look at the materials needed
to prepare for it at that time, which is then easily
forgotten,” said I-Iafer:

As far as the pros and cons are concerned,
Donehue believes the online medium just might
not be for everyone '

“its ‘not for every professor; and it’s not for
every studen ” said Donehue “It’s not a better
modality and it’s not a lesser modality. But it is
deﬁnitely dilferent”

In the course of the last

i few decades, the Internet has

revolutionized almost every as-

“pect of society, from the way
f we shop, to entertainment, to
 banking, to national defense.
I Now, with Google’s help, the

idea of free speech might be

5 rethought as well.

In a recent obscenity case

I in a Florida court, the defense

Google Trends, which tracks.

‘popular search terms across
?its servers. According to the
A defense, the prevalence of the

search term “orgy” over terms

' like “watermelon” and “apple

' pie-

‘indicates that the com-
munity has accepted orgies into
the social norm, and therefore

:the sale of videos featuring

3 facts
 case —— terms like “orgy’

these sex acts shouldn’t be con-
sidered obscene.

While it’s hard to deny the
behind ‘the defense’s
’ and
“boobs” are far more common
than more mundane search val-
ues —— it’s not clear that the in-
terpretation is accurate. With-
out debating whether orgies

3. should be considered obscene,
* it’s apparent that the issue at the

heart of this debate is whether
or not the Internet can be seen
as a reliable proxy for society at
large.

Unfortunately, this - isn’t
quite as straightforward as it
might seem. While the Internet
is certainly a huge aspect of

, society in ‘the modern world,

people‘ don’t behave the same
in the physical world as they do

 when surﬁng the Web.

The main issue here seems
to be anonymity —— the fact
that one’s identity cannot be

i easily determined online, and

therefore people are freer to
indulge in activities online than
they are in real life. Because
of this, something that people
might see as obscene if they

ran into it on the street, such
as an orgy, could be considered
commonplace on the Internet.
_ Because of this discrepancy,
people have different expecta-
tions for what happens'on the
street than what might happen
on the Internet, despite the fact
that both are ‘technically “pub-
lic.” Even though the Internet
is public by deﬁnition, people
experience it almost entirely in
the privacy of their homes.

In this way, what someone

looks at online is comparable to '

whether he smokes cigarettes or
drink in his home. Some people
may not like it, but it’s not il-
legal if done in privacy assum-
ing the person consuming the
content, either liquor or porn,
is consenting and of age. ‘

Because people could eas-
ily have the same conception
about what they look _at on the
Internet, it’s not right to stack
Google search terms for what
people would look up in the
privacy of their homes against
the “contemporary community
standards” that deﬁne obscen-
ity.

For example, people prob-
ably wouldn’t search for “orgy”
on Google if they were sitting
in Starbucks or in the library.
The expectation of privacy dis-
tinctly alters people’s behavior
in a way that makes it impossi-
ble to gauge public community
standards against online activ-
ity.

In other words, Google

Trends might tell us what peo-_

ple are searching for online,
but it doesn’t tell us what they
would be okay with encounter-
ing it in the outside world. The
Internet, while able to indicate
what the public may like or is
interested in, cannot rightfully
be used, as a reliable standard
for what society as a whole

would ﬁnd to be an acceptable

Prison labor solves world's problems

    

by Giles Howard
Colummltt

British jails became so over-
crowded in the early 17th century

that they began to punish crimes‘
with the sentence of transpor_ta- I

tion. From thieves to felons, thou-
sands of British criminals were
shipped off ﬁrstto North America
and then, starting in 1788, to Aus-
tralia. ‘

For a long time it worked.

Prisoners were used as slave la-
bor to establish British colonies in
the United States and Australia at
very little cost to the state. In. short,
the Brits knew what they were do-
ing when it came to handling the
criminal elements of society.

We, in the United States, have
a lot to learn from this history of
transportation.

Modern standards of human
rights and concern for the dignity
of man have prevented the United
States from making the most of its
growing prison population. The
prison population in this country
has increased by 367 percent since
1980, according to a recent article
in Mother Jones.

This increase means that one
in 100 American adults, 2.3 million
people to be speciﬁc, are currently
incarcerated. I y . I

These prisoners are a ﬁnancial

 
 

drain on local, state and federal

governments. Sure, a few states ’

employ chain gangs of prisoners to
repair roads or dig graves, but pris-

V on labor is an untapped resource

that we must explore.

The United States today does
not have the same options the Brit-
ish did in the 17th century. We can
no longer hang people for petty
theft, and Australia "is no longer a
penal colony. ‘

Instead of using the prison 3

population to colonize continents
in the Paciﬁc, the United States will
have to use its prisoners as a source
of cheap domestic labor.

This could solve a, number of
problems.

First, illegal immigrant labor will
no longer be needed in this country.
The argument that they performed
jobs that no other American would
do  no longer be true when 2.3

I million Americans can be forced to

do any job for far less than even il-
legal immigrants.

’ It’s all about  two birds‘
with one stone, .which is why pris-
on labor should also be used to re-
build the entire state of Iowa.

The ﬂoods -have done a lot of
damage to the Hawkeye State, but

Tif some two million prisoners were

to take part in the rebuilding effort,
we could restart corn and ethanol
production in no time.

And’ if ‘ the prisoners tried to

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

escape in Iowa, where would they
go? South Dakota? I think not.
But prison labor can be used
for far more than picking avocados
and. rebuilding an entire rnid-west-

" Cfﬂ state.

Prisoners in Texas already man-

ufacture everything from sinks to-

showers to bullwhips. In Washing-
ton-, prisoners package holiday cof-
fees for a Starbucks subcontractor,
and some inmates are even em-
ployed in call centers. ~

Prison labor can be used in the

creation of almost every consumer V
product. They can be used in ag— ’

riculture and construction. The
cheapness of their labor is one
incentive to use prisoners in the
economy, but perhaps the No. 1
reason to use prison labor is that
felons have almost no voice in our
society._ ',

Mother Jones reported that 48

states don’t allow prisoners to vote, A

30 don’t allow felons on probation
to vote, and eight states__don’t allow
many ex—felons to ever vote.

This means‘ that the nation’s‘

new cheap labor force won’t be

' able to effectively oppose its work-

ing for pennies to make bullwhips

' in Texas. If these people don’t have I

the ability to vote, then they really
would have no power as a union

either. ‘ ‘ '
Think about it," the US. courts
have already thoroughly destroyed

,Kansas Rep. Todd Tiahrt
walked up to the podium last

Wednesday afternoon, intro-
duced himself and announced,
‘‘I _want to start this press con-
ference with one word ...” as he
unrolled a giant scroll -reading
“VINDICATION!!!” .
Indeed, it was. Tiahrt has been
pushing for months to get the
Air Force to reverse its decision
awarding a $35 billion contract
for building a new line of mid-
air refueling tankers to Northrop

_ Grumman and its partner, the

European Aeronautic Defense
and Space Company. ’

Early that day, the Govern-

ment Accountability Ofﬁce an-
nounced the ﬁndings of a three-
.month investigation, concluding

R that the Air Force, which handed

out the contract, had made mul-
tiple errors in reaching its con-
clusion and called for a re-evalu-
ation of the contract.

To recap, a contract to replace
the Air Force’s KC—l35 tankers,

many of which are still around
from the Eisenhower era, is up

for grabs. Throughout the length '

of time needed to replace the
entire fleet, the contract may be
worth up to $100 billion.

If it goes to Northrop—EADS,
as was originally announced in
February, the tanker would use
parts made in France, Great Brit-
ain, Germany and Spain and be
manufactured in France. Boeing,
on the other hand,-would use a

"frame built in Everett,» Wash.,

and be fully assembled into a
tanker in Wichita, Kan. Accord-
ing to journalist Lou Dobbs, the
Northrop-EADS contract would
create 14,000 jobs, while Boeing
would double that with 28,000
American jobs.

In his scathing report on the
outsourcing of ‘US. defense, Lou
Dobbs referred to it as a “ter-
rible, terrible bidding process.”

- Althoughthe original conclusion

reached by the Air Force might
have been idiotic, the bidding
process has an important role in
the process.

For those with short memo.-

the power of unions of voting citi-
zens to strike and bargain collec-
tively. Why even allow non—voting
prisoners and ex-felons to organize
in the ﬁrst place?

‘ a With introduction of about two i

million prisoners to the work force,
each working for pennies an hour,
the minimum wage might even

become obsolete. Nothing would -
. pull this economy out of its cur— .

rent slump like the eradication of
the minimum wage. .

Our nation is already well on its

way to achieving this dream. Many
states have already privatized in-

dividual prisons, and the state of

. Florida has actually turned its en-

tire state prison system over to a

private corporation. — 7

It’s time for the re_st,of these
United States to follow the lead of
Florida. Pennsylvania has already
pursued limited privatization, but it
is not enough. i 7

One day I expect this dream will
berealized as chain gangs stretch
from the East to West coasts and

from the Rio Grande to Niagara p

Falls.

ries, it was just seven years ago
when Sen. John McCain spear-
headed an investigation into sus-
picious dealings between the Air
Force and Boeing. It turned’ out
that a major acquisition officer at
the Air Force, Darleen Druyun,
had been unfairly steering Air
Force contracts toward Boeing
without bidding processes in
exchange for guaranteed high-
level employment with Boeing ~
for herself, her daughter and a
son.-in—law after sheﬁnished her

,work with-the federal govern-

ment.

After all was said and done,
the Boeing scandal of 2001
found its scapegoats. Druyun
plea-bargained and spilled all,

. and, in combination with a 

sentence for Boeing CFO lVIi-
chael Sears and the forced res-
ignation of then-Boeing CEO
Phil Condit, there was a general
sense of closure regarding the
scandal. . "'
In order to avoid the same
abuse of power Boeing used
back then, this is precisely why
a bidding process is a necessary

part of the process today.
That doesn’t mean, however,
that Boeing should be unfairly

cut out of the picture, or that

our national defense needs to be
outsourced?

It might be the case that the
Air Force was trying to push ‘the
Boeing scandal out of the pic-
ture by siding with another com-
pany, whether it was more quali-
ﬁed for the project or not. That
may be understandable given the
strained relationship between
the two over the past decade, but
if the Air Force was acting pre-
emptively to avoid another scan-
dal by minimizing its relationship
with Boeing, it clearly misjudged
where American priorities lie.

Less than live years since
the end of the scandal, the U.S.
economy has been exploited
and outsourcedto the brink of
recession. Our priorities have
shifted. Keeping a $35 billion
national defense contract
paid for by John  Taxpayer —
and 2,800 American jobs within
our borders is far more impor-
tant than allowing the Air Force

  Air Force contracts violate U.S. principles

to strengthen its image by push-
ing away an embarrassing link to
past failures. And the public out-
cry ensured that the Air Force
realized that.

As for what happens now,
is it total vindication, as Tiahrt
believes? Well, not exactly. The
decision by the GAO is non-
binding, meaning that if the Air
Force still desires, it can award
the contract to Northrop Grum-
man7Corp.,,et al. It might even
end up that Defense Secretary
Robert Gates will make the de-
cision, after firing the Air Force
chief of staff and Air Force sec-
retary earlier this month in unre-

lated matters.

But if the Air Force’s original
intention was to distance itself
from controversy, acting against
the GAO and the public major-
ity is not the way to go about it.
Here is to hoping that our tax
dollarsiwill be invested in Ameri-
can workers providing American
defense with American tax dol-
lars when we need it most.

Nanssa Handler, of the allocations committee of
the Student Government Board, defends denying the
men’s club lacrosse team  to go to its playoffs.
I can’t be alone in scratching my head at the sheer in-
competence of this. I challenge her and her SGB bud-
dies to convince any sane person that it is right to deny
the lacrosse players $2,861 on the one hand and sock
away more than $40,000 in summer activities fees on
the other, supposedly because no one has requested it

The truth, as Handler admits, is that the lacrosse
players were perhaps too busy actually ‘doing some-
thing to develop the intimate acquaintance with inane
rules and regulations that prying any money out of the
iron ﬁst of the allocations committee requires.

In 2005, SGB approved money to send them-
selves to a leadership conference (which, to be fair,
they no doubt desperately needed) and another $139,000

LETTER TO THE 

for themselves to hold an invitation-only Red Carpet
Event. This year, they managed to scrape together
$60,000 to pay for 10 ﬁberglass panthers. So, you can’t
say they’re completely ineffectual. I
Rhajiv Ratnatunga, a former allocations committee
member, said in arecent Pitt News article that the stu-
dent activities fee is “one of those standard fees you
just have to pay,” as if students have no right to de-
mand that once they’ve paid it, something useful actu-
ally be done with it I think most studentswould join
me in  on the allocations comrriittee to use the
fee to encourage student activities rather than  the
committee’s control over the purse strings to get in the
way of student activities coming off successfully.

Beneath the swirling pixie dust
and midnight sky clashed with
stars, “Peter Pan” is every Freud-
ian scholar’s dream come true.
The performance has long been
a favorite of wide-eyed children,
but it seems that some very adult
themes underlie the whimsical
tale of fairies and pirates.
Tony-nominated actors Cathy

 ‘R-igby and Tom ‘Hewitt star in

“Peter Pan,” which opened Satur-

the Darling children, who fol-
low the young boy Peter Panto

Neverland, an island inhabited s

by scheming pirates and sinister
crocodiles — a place where chil-
dren never have to grow up.

“I don’t think there’s an actor
who would turndown the chance
to play Captain Hook. He’s such
a twisted, complicated character
and so unabashedly ev' ,” said
Hewitt. ‘

The role might have given He-
witt the chance to strap on pirate
boots and berate young children,
but it also presented technical
challenges. ' i

“There are a lot of sword
ﬁghts, and I’m not always the
sharpest knife in the drawer,” he
said. ,

Theatrical tradition in “Peter
Pan” is for one actor to play both
Captain Hook and Mr. Darling,
which makes some suspect the
title character of having a bit of

sword, Hook inspires castration.

sented by Pan. The Oedipal fan— _,

tasy of seducing the mother is
completed when Peter rescues his
caretaker and companion Wendy
from Captain Hook at the play’s
climax. ii i

According to Hewitt, ‘Hook
and his pirate gang are actually
quite sympathetic —— beneath
their vile exteriors, they are only
little boys in desperate need of a
mother.

“It’s possible that Barrie
was inﬂuenced by Freud’s.ideas,”
said Hewitt. “Both  par-
ents become sort of malevolent in
Neverland. Mrs. Darling becomes

an evil mermaid who threatens’

to kill one of the boys. There’s

them.” i

Changes at the
speed of sound

for Coldplay

Senior Staﬁ” Write/‘

Viva la Vida or Death
and All His Friends

Coldplay

Capitol Records

Rocks like: Arcade Fire, Snow
Patrol, The Fray

 

l/2'04 la Vida, Coldplay’s newest
8; album, is a perfect blend of new
  and old for the band.

Gone are the melodic piano accompani-
ments that populated Pamc/Jztter and other pre-
vious releases by the band — they’re replaced
with a more vibrant sound from violins, syn-
thesizers and drums. Vocalist Chris Martin’s
signature falsetto singing style has also been
scaled down to more natural sounding vocals.
Despite these changes, the sound that Coldplay
is known for — a blend of soft vocals and me-
lodic arrangements of music — is definitely
here.’ i

  

  

  

The album’s title track, “Viva la Vi ” is

representative of Coldplay’s new blend of old
and new The’ song begins with a catchy violin
rhythm, replacing the piano from older albums,
followed quickly by Martin’s voice. Guitar and
violin blend effortlessly in the background, of-
fering a unique counter—rhythm to the lead vioé
lin pulsating in the foreground. » A

Key moments of the song are highlighted
by blasts of music, creating a symphony of
sound.’ When the lyrics describe “pillars of
sound,” they’re followed by a ttiumphant surge
of violin, guitar, drums and Martin’s falsetto.

“Viva la Vida” is easily one _of the better‘ tracks.

on the album. .

The most interesting song on the album is
“Lovers in]apan/ Reign of Love,” a song that
is split into two very different parts. The first is.
standard Coldplay rhythm guitar, drums and
Martin’s unique vocal style. The second part
of the song is a drastic shift from the first,
bringing back the piano from Parachutes and
toning down Martin’s vocals considerably. It
is a melodic love song — slow, emotional and
an anticlimacticiend to the song’s fast, upbeat
0pening~ , ‘

If there is a problem with Coldplay’s lat-
est offering, it is the fact that the changes to
Coldplay’s sound are nothing drastic. Replac-
ing a piano with a violin and lowering Martin’s

, vocal range make for some unique sounding

songs, but nothing sounds much different than
previous Coldplay outings. Martin’s vocals are
once  occasionally lost within the musi-

"Peter Pan, " page 11
diences by maintaining a high degree of
professionalism.

“I thought ‘Peter Pan’ was a kid’s
show, but the story is universal. It’s a re-
ally sophisticated production,” said Hewitt.
“[Rigby’s] presence makes it transcendent.
Other actresses who play Peter Pan are of-
ten still very much women, but [Rigby] 2':
a little boy. The way she moves is just like
a little boy. Her commitment to the role is
just so convincing.”_ «

Q Before becoming an actress, Rigby was

an Olympic gymnast. As the ﬁrst Ameri-
can woman to win a medal in the World
Gymnastics Competition, she holds 12 in-
ternational medals. She also earned a Tony
nomination when she starred as Peter Pan
in the 3_5th anniversary Broadway produc-
tion of the play. v

“She’s an actress in the purest sense of
the word,” said Hewitt. “She makes you re-
ally want to step it up and have something
very grounded in naturalism.”

“Peter Pan” ﬁrst debuted as a musical

in 1954. 'Mark “Moose” Charlap, along
vvith Jule Styne, composed the score to

accompany the story of “Peter Pan,” cre-
ating songs like “I’m Flying,” “I Won’t
Grow Up” and “I’ve Got to Crow.”

Though “Peter Pan” can be interpreted
in many ways, the cast of the Pittsburgh
CLO production promises to captivate

young audiences. Only theater—goers ca!‘

decide whether the sword fights and rnid—
night ﬂights are dark allusions or simply
the dreams of children upon the stage.

afritt swimming for gold

Pitt Senior earns trip to ’08 Olympic trials

by Emily Steiner
;Staﬂ' Writer

' Stacie Safritt might have achance to
swim against the world. Safritt, a Pitt
senior, will be competing for a spot on

_ the Olympic swim team next week after"

she qualiﬁed for the Olympic trials at the
Omaha Swimvitationaljune 15. ,

_ Safritt’ said qualifying has always been
a goal in the back of her mind. And it
comes after a rough end to her junior
season, which was marked by a sudden,

‘meet-endingﬂu at the Big East Cham-

pionships and shoulder problems during

post-season training in April. \ _
To get back in shape topqualify, Saf-'
jritt was right back in the pool after her

physical problems passed.
Safritt took a break from swimming

in mid-May,‘ but she still wasn’t exactly

outof the water. She took two weeks off
of practice to go on a cruise, 2. move that
made her coaches skeptical because of
its proximity to the ‘Olympic trials.

But in the end, Pitt coach Chuck

Knoles said it was for the best.
V “It turned out that she needed [the
break] at that point,” said Knoles.
Even after getting to this year’s Swim-
vitational, Safritt was still facing an uphill
battle. Only 24 swimmers from the pre-

liminary heats got to return to ﬁnals, and ,
. Safritt’s 27th-place ﬁnish didn’t make the

cut —.7 at least not at ﬁrst.
After three swimmers were scratched

from the competition, Safritt ‘moved

up to 24th and had the chance to race
agai'n.i , A 

‘ Safritt touched in at 26.19 seconds in
the 50-meter freestyle event, taking 17th

place and coming back from the 27th.

place ﬁnish in the preliminary race.
She ended up qualifying and has spent
a week and ‘a half doing intense work-

. outs since then; She’ll spend the rest of

her workouts doing lower amounts of
yardage and keeping her body as. rested
and relaxed as possible, which is a com-
mon‘ ‘routine called tapering that swim-
mers use before big meets." _

As destiny would have it, she’s also

lucky enough to race in the same pool
that she swam at for the trials —-the
Qwest Center in Omaha, Neb. . '

}‘It’s such an advantage,” said Knoles. '

“Going to a high pressure situation like
that and having already swam in the fa-
cility, that’s huge for them.” ' '

In order to be considered for the
Olympic team, Safritt will need to ﬁnish

, in the top two of the competition.

But Knoles said it will be tough to ﬁn-
ishwith a time that strong.
_ 5‘That would be a stretch,” said Knoles.
“But you never want to tell someone like
Stacie that, because the sky is always the

I

I limit for her.” _

Safritt acknowledged she might not i

make the Olympic‘ cut,’ so she’s setting
other goals. "

“I would like to do well,’,’ said Safritt.
“But the main goal that I want to have is
to enjoy the experience and have fun. Of
course I’d like to have a successful swim,
but I’mgjust happy to get to this level.
Ultimately my goal would be to place
within the top 24 or 16.”

Knoles said Safritt’s motivation and
thrill for competition isone of the things
that makes her successful and gives her a
chance. I '

“She’s a very, very stubborn—minded
competitor,” said Knoles. “She has a
little bit of that Tiger Woods mentality.
She decides she’s going to do something
and she has to do it.”

It’s gotten her far. As a swimmer she
has continually led her team with a slew
of wins and will lead as Pitt’s captain
for the 2008-09 "season. As a person, her
coach can’t speak about Safritt with any-
thing but pride.

“We’re very,‘very proud of her,” said

Knoles. “I’m most proud as a head coach .

that she has worked through obstacles
that -have appeared in her life to get her
where she is. That’s really the hallmark
of maturity and of a great athlete — that
you’re able to take the obstacles of life
that happen, and you can work through

. them to make them better. She’s done

that.” '47

Can the Pirates survive

tough intrleague play?

   
 

  

At me /mt wit/.r
Mike and Zack

  
  

-Is Joba Chamberlain going to get
his first career win as a starter tonight
against the Pirates?

Mike Gladyszz You’ve got to assume
that the Yankees will ﬁnally give Cham-
berlain some run support this time out.
In his last three starts, Chamberlain has
gone an average of 5 1/3 innings and
allowed just four total runs but hasn’t
managed a decision. Not only that, but
Zach Duke, who’s set to start tonight for
the Pirates, has never pitched against the
Yankees.

Although Duke has been a solid start-
er for the Pirates this year, the Yankees?
lineup is different. And if Chamberlain
pitches the way he has been as of» late,
he’ll be tough to beat.

Zack Chakan: l’m sick and tired of
hearing about Chamberlain. There, I
said it. .

The man’s got talent, there is no

doubting that. -Chamberlain can bring
the heat and racks up strikeouts by the
bunches. But he’s not completely ac-
climated to the workload of a starting
pitcher, having pitched only 18 innings
in four starts.

The Pirates have Duke matching up
against Chamberlain, and he’s been their
best pitcher this season after being left
for dead only months ago.‘ Duke has a
3.91 ERA despite a low strikeout rate. 4

If Pittsburgh stays patient, it should
hang with Chamberlain and New York
tonight, but the bullpen has faltered as
of late and probably will again against
the high—powered Yankees. Chamberlain
won’t get the win but won’t grab a loss
either. '

-Which players do the Pirates need
to key in on this week against the
Yankees and Rays?

MG: The Pirates really can’t hone in
on one single player against the Yanks.
But they should focus on pitching smart
to players like Bobby Abreu, Alex Rodri-

Pirates, page 17

The New York Yankees’ Mike Mussina, who is scheduled to start tomorrow night at 7:05
p.m., is 10-5 this season with a 3.93 ERA. He's set to face Pittsburgh's "Paul Maholm.

Chakan: Yankees’ A-Rod
the greatest onthe planet

Pirates, page l6

' guez and Jason Giambi. These guys are

going to get their hits, but the Buccos

i "should pick their spots, hit their spots

_and keep the damage to a minimum. If
they can limit the heartof the Yankees’
order to singlesor even walks, they can
keep the runtally low. J

Against the Rays, the Pirates should
be especially careful pitching to B]. Up-
ton and Carl Crawford, two of the more
talented young players in the league.

ZC: Obviously, the Pirates have to
contain Rodriguez, the greatest player
on the planet. ' .

But the Yankees have other fantastic
athletes that, if neutralized, could spell a
few victories for the Buccos.

New York trots out a fearsome lineup
consisting of five left—handed mashers:
Giambi, _Abreu, Johnny Damon, Hideki
Matsui and. Robinson Cano. Pittsburgh
"will throw three lefty starters at the Yan-
kees in Tom Gorzelanny, Duke and Paul
Maholm. If the hurlers win the lefty-
lefty matchups, New York will struggle
to score. .

Tampa Bay outﬁelder Carl Crawford
is a ﬁrecracker waiting to explode at all
time. He ﬂies at the plate, on the bases
and in the ﬁeld. When he reaches first,
the Pirates need to watch him carefully
because Crawford will steal at will and
manufacture plenty of runs.

-Do the Pirates have a chance at
winning either series against the Yan-
kees and Rays?

MG: If they didn’t have a chance,
they wouldn’t play the game. The series
against the Yankees is going to come
down to offense. The Yankees will likely
hit and score a good amount of runs
against Pittsburgh’s' pitching. It’s just a

' question of whether the Pirates can keep

up with New York offensively.

As far as the Rays go, they’re one of
the biggest surprises of the year. The
team has been strong, and its young tal-
ent plays well together. But the Buccos

‘ deﬁnitely have a shot at taking home one

of these series and hovering just below
.500.

ZC: Pittsburgh is a totally different
and better team at PNC Park than away
from it. That alone could mean multiple
wins. for the Bucs. '

But the Pirates are brutally awful in
interleague play since its inception. Their
interleague recordis the worst of any
franchise by a large margin, and it could
get ‘uglier by the end of the week.

As of Monday night, the Pirates are

_ winless in six games against the Yankees.

They will probably only manage one vic-
tory against New York. d
' Pittsburgh could take two of three
against the Rays, but they are one of the
better teams in baseball right now, and
their lineup could tee off against a de-
pleted Pirates’ pitching staff without Ian
Snell or Phil Dumatrait for those games.
Best case scenario, the Piratesxpull off
a 3-3 week, but 2-4 seems more likely.

Basketball

USA Basketball managing
director Jerry Colangelo an-
nounced the 2008 men’s Olym-
pic team roster Monday, ac-
cording to the Associated Press.
Kbbe Bryant, the 2008 NBA
MVP, will make his ﬁrst appear-
ance in the Olympics and will be
joined by perennial all-stars Le-
Bron James, Dwayne Wade and
Carmelo Anthony. _

Other players named to the
squad include guards Chris Paul,
Deron Williams, Jason Kidd
and Michael Redd, along with
forwards Carlos Boozer, Chris
Bgosh and Tayshaun Prince.
Dwight Howard was the only
true center named to the team-.

The 2008 NBA draft begins
Thursday at 7 p.m., according
to espn.com. The Chicago Bulls
have the first overall pick.

‘Many believe the battle for

the No. 1 pick will come down
to two players — former Mem-
phis guard Derrick Rose and‘
former Kansas State forward
Michael Beasley. 

Rose led Memphis to the
NCAA Championship game
as a freshman, and scouts have
compared him to current NBA
stars Kidd and Wade.

Beasley helped Kansas State

to its ﬁrst NCAA Tournament

appearance since 1996 and ﬁn-
ished as the runner-up to Tyler
Hansbrough for player of the
year honors.

At Kansas State, Beasley ay-
eraged 26.2 points and 12.4 re-
bounds in 33 games.

Tennis

The 2008 Wimbledon Cham-
pionships began on Monday
with top—ranked Roger Federer
in action, according to the Asso-
ciated Press. Federer, who is go-

'ing for a record-breaking sixth-

straight title, started by beating
Slovak. Dominik Hrbaty in his
ﬁrst match. /

Federer is coming _off a dis-
appointing French Open result
in which he lost to Rafael Nadal
in the ﬁnals for the third straight

- year. The French Open is the
only grand slam title that Feder-

er has not won. He is only two
Grand Slam titles away from ty-
ing the all—time record of 14,
which was set by Pete Sampras.

Baseball

The Pittsburgh Pirates will
be facing the New York Yan-
kees this week at home for the
ﬁrst time since the 1960 World
Series, which the Pirates won in
seven games. 0

The Pirates are coming.off a
series win against the Toronto

Blue Jays, which recently ﬁred

manager John Gibbons Friday.
