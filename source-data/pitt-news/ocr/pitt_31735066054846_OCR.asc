Elderly pedestrian dead, his wife and truck driver hospitalized

News Edttor  .
An elderly pedestrian was killed and
his wife injured Wednesday when an Air
Freight truck rambled onto a Forbes

Avenue sidewalk and crashed through the

p1ate—glass storefront of an Oakland busi-
ness.

The female pedesuian was taken to
the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center’s Presbyterian Hospital in critical
condition, according to Doug Garretson, a
medic at the scene. V

The driver was conscious when
medics removed him from the wreckage.
He remained conscious at Presbyterian
Hospital, where he was in serious condi-
tion Wednesday evening, according to a
UPMC spokesman.

The names of the three victims were
withheld by hospital oﬂicials at the request
of their families.

Police" and hospital officials said they
were not yet sure why the man lost control
of his truck, but medics at the scene spec-
ulated he may have sulfered a stroke, heart
attack or seizure.

The accident happened at about 1:20

p.rn.

Vifitnesses said the truck was traveling
east on Forbes Avenue toward Pitt’s cam-
pus when it suddenly veered across
oncoming trafﬁc onto the sidewalk and
came to rest in the storeroom of Life
Uniform, located at the comer of Forbes
Avenue and McKee Place.

The truck slipped through a narrow
space on the sidewalk between a telephone
pole and three cars_ parked a few feet away
in front of the store. The cars and the pole
were not damaged, but the truck cleanly
sawed oﬁ a no-parking sign in its path.

The 30-foot-long_ truck left shards of
broken glass and a gaping hole in front of
the building. ‘

Allan Sehnitzer, 25, of White Oak,
was in the lobby adjacent to Life Uniform
waiting for his friend, who was in the
store. He said the accident happened so
quickly he barely had time to react when
he saw the truck coming.

He said he managed to jump away
from the window, but the truck still came
to rest within inches of him.

"The only thing I know is, glass start-
ed shattering, and I was almost hit,” he
said. “IfI didn’t move, I’d have been hit.”

Carrie Thomas, a Pitt junior, said
the truck came within IO feet of her
as she stood inside Life Uniform,

where she is the assistant manager.

Sehnitzer, who volunteers as a para-
.. medic for White Oak Rescue, said he
immediately rushed to aid the victims.

Gay student group: Pitt
needs ”queer studies”

Christal Hall

   
  

Staff Writer

While most students pursue
conventional majors, other students
are fighting for the opportunity to
receive a degree in queer studies.

Rainbow Alliance President
Christie L. Hudson said she wants
Queer Theory added to the course
selection because many students are
not properly educated about people
with alternative lifestyles.

Hudson’s idea was only one of
the methods of educating Pitt stu-
dents about having respect for peo-
ple with different lifestyles and
beliefs discussed at the Rainbow

Al1iance’s first general body meet-

ing last week.

C0—president Raymond Murphy
said he feels the campus is insensi-
tive to the needs of gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transsexual students.
Students sometimes lump all people
with alternative lifestyles into one
generalized group, he said.

“The needs of a gay white man
are not the same as the needs of a
queer black woman,” Murphy said.

Murphy added that he intends to
work with the Resident Student
Association on having resident

assistants trained in gay and lesbian '

sensitivity.
“I would like to get pink trian-

He said he and a nurse who also wit-
nessed the accident stabilized the female
pedestrian and made sure she could
breath. Her husband didn’t have a pulse

and wasn’t breathing, according to

Sehnitzer, so they performed CPR in an
effort save him.

Pitt junior Canie Thomas, 21, is an
assistant manager at Life Uniform and
was working when the accident occurred.

Thomas was standing about 10 feet
from where the truck came to rest. As the
truck approached the store, it appeared to
be in slow motion, she said.

“All I saw was the truck come over
the curb, and when it hit the curb, I just
screamed,” Thomas said.

she had her back to the front of the store,

was uesigned strictlyto find out if
water was on the moon but cannot
accurately give an amount of water.

“These are educated guesses on
our part because we do not know if
the ice is mixed in with the moon’s
soil or how deep it is,” he said. “It
could possibly be even more than
that.” ‘

Binder was also quick to note

that an accurate assessment of the

amount of water will not be avail-
able until probably the year 2002,
when a land rover is expected to
land on the moon for exploration.
The water could serve asja focal
point for building a long-talked-
about lunar colony. Thepresence of
water on the moon is crucial because
it eliminates the need to transport
water to the colony from Earth.
Binder said_the possibility of
having a space station on the moon
has always existed; this just makes
things simpler.
Since water can be easily broken

_ down to its elements —— hydrogen‘
and oxygen —— to" make rocket fuel,

spacecraft couldcruise even farther
into space usinggthe lunar colony as
a base. i ‘
Hapke said ‘the possibility of a
lunar—based space station is now
more likely than any other type of
structure, partly because the discov-
ery of water makes it a cheaper Ven-
ture.
‘ . “It costs approximately $11,000

if "a pound to put something into

orbit,” he said. -“With a major com-
porifejrit necessary to have a station
anrd‘jla1‘1_nch other ‘spacecrafts farther
into space alre_ady"in._existence and
readily availableito them, it just
makes it that much easier and less
costly.” . -  -

FROM PAGE 1

Effective money-management
has been something that the U.S.
government and taxpayers have
been emphasizing to NASA over the
past few years. Last year’s landing
of a cjraft/on Mars was one of the
biggest breakthroughs in NASA’s
history but was not nearly as costly
as other missions. '

All of the moon’s water is at the
poles —— most of it at the north pole
— and it’s frozen. Temperatures
there are constantly about minus 250
degrees Fahrenheit, and the water
would need to be thawed somehow
before it could ever be put to use.

So far, NASA’s plan is to imple-’

ment machinery that can withstand
the extreme temperature, break up
the ice, and use solar reflectors to
thaw it, according to Binder.
“These aspects are relatively
straightforward engineering: prob-
lems, and the overwhelming positive

components far outweigh any nega-

tive,” he said; .

Because of this,‘ Hapke, who has
worked with Binder for years, hopes
to_Itake even bigger .,steps with
NASA in the future. I‘ 

“At the moment,’ Carnegie
Mellon University is active in its
attempts for funding from NASA to
build robots for ‘future NASA, pro-
jects, and we would like to be a part
of that.” I E .

Hapke said he hopes that Pitt
and CMU can make a joint effort in
NASA’s future, but he was quick to
point out that it’s premature to say
anything for sure.

 “Everything is just in the kick-
igng‘-around stages,” he said. But
a'cic-ording to Binder, CMU and his
office; in California are very excited
about the possibilities.

UMPC discovery may help decrease of brain damage from stroke

Nic Pedicino

For The Pitt News

Experimenting with nerve cells in
rats’ brains, Pitt researchers have made
a discovery that may help develop
drugs to prevent brain damage in stroke
patients. - ‘

“We discovered that neurons can

. tolerate 20 times more calcium than

what was formerly believed to be
lethal,” said Amy Stout, a student inves~
tigator at Pitt’s School of Medicine.
This finding contradicts a long-held
belief that calcium within a cell’s cyto-
plasm caused cells to die. '
A stroke occurs when an artery rup-
tures or is closed by a blood clot or

other obstruction. When a blood vessel
ruptures, it ﬂoods nearby neurons with
excessive calcium, which can damage
or kill them.

In their studies, the researchers cul-
tured the neurons from the brains of rats
and exposed them to varying amounts
of calcium.'In some cases, they also
exposed the cells to chemicals that
block the intake of calcium by the
power plant of the cell, themitochon-
dria. Cells that received high levels of
calcium and mitochondrial blockers
lived. Those that did not died.

“This information clearly shows
that we should consider designing drugs
to target mitochondria to prevent or
intervene in neuron damage,” said Dr.

Ian Reynolds, associate professor of

pharmacology at the medical school.
Neurons are cells that receive infor-

mation and transmit it to other cells by

electrochemical impulses. An entire .

system of neurons makes it possible for
a pinch to be felt or a leg to move.
When neurons die, they cannot be
replaced. A dead neuron causes other
neurons that depended on it for input to
become less active

A neuron consist of a cell mem-

brane enclosing ﬂuid cytoplasm. Within ~

the cytoplasm are structures that have
specific jobs in cellular activities. The

rons, while changes in calcium-sensi-
tive enzymes in the cytoplasm are like
dimmer switches that change the health
of a neuron by degrees, according to
Reynolds.

Calcium may ruin mitochondria
through a number of mechanisms.
Normally, mitochondria can absorb
excess calcium from cells, but constant-
ly cycling calcium out of the cytoplasm
may sap mitochondria of energy they
normally produce to charge cells.
Calcium inﬂux also can spur the forma-
tion of mutated oxygen that would dam-
age or rip holes in the mitochondria.

The ﬂow of calcium into mitochon-
dria appears to trigger the death of neu-
rons exposed to glutamate, a chemical

that transmits impulses between nerve

cells and is toxic when overproduced in
brain injury and stroke, Reynolds said."

Glutamate works by binding to
receptors on the surface of a neuron.
This binding activates the ﬂow of calci-
um that triggers the neuron to release
additional glutamate, stimulating other
neurons to do the same. When injured
ordiseased, nerves release too much
glutamate, which over—stimulates the

- injured neurons and the healthy ones

around it. All of the neurons begin tak-
ing on excess calcium.
Together with Dr. Teresa Hasting,

assistant professor of neurology at Pitt,

Reynolds recently received over $1 n1il—
lion in grant money to study mitochon~
drial responses in injured neurons.

Minimum-wage earners
deserve fair piece of the pie

It’s nice to know whom GOP
senators support. Judging by their

rejection of a proposal that would
have raised the minimum wage by

$1 an hour, it’s clearly not those

struggling to scrape together a liv-

ing on the ‘current $5.25 an hour.
The proposal, defeated 55-44 in

the Senate Tuesday, was needed for
hard-working people trying to sur-

vive on miriimurn-wage jobs. The
GOP’s rallying against this proposal‘

to appeaseits masters-in-business is

a slap in the face of every working
American.

j Opponents of the bill (come
election time, remember that Sen.
Rick Santorum, R-Pa, chose to

ignore Pittsburgh’s minimum—wage

earners) said that the “proposal.
would hurt small -businesses and

increase unemployment. In a time

when huge companies and con-
stantly merging corporations are
squeezing out small businesses in
towns across America and corpora-
tions are exacting cutbacks in a time
of economic prosperity, itis clear

A that the Republicans don’t have

small businesses and working peo-

. ple in mind.

V A minimum—wage. increase
would have negligible effects on
GOP backers. Why hand out a min-
irnurn-wage job to an American at

$5.25 when it’s given to a Mexican
at less than a dollar? Swelling prof-
its and high rates of economic

growth have not sifted down to low- ’

wage earners. They have seen their
purchasing power eroded and
watched their bosses get richer.

Full-time workers earning the
minimum wage make an average of
$10,700 a year, which is $2,900
below the oﬁicial poverty level for a
family of three. In a period of sus-
tained growth, those with money
and power are getting more, and
those with less money and power
are getting less.

The proposal should have
passed. Even students and part-time
workers not supporting a family
need an increase. Workers putting
forth eﬁort should be ‘paid what
they’re worth —— they are worth that
extra dollar more.

If it were the senators earning
$5.25 an hour, there would be no
hesitation in raising the wage. But
then, of course, they were never in a
position where they needed a mini-
mum-wage job at any time in their
lives. 4

The proposal should be brought «

up again and passed. But with busi-
nesses lining Republican pockets to
keep the rate down, don’t expect it
to happen too soon.

Socialism: government for the foolish

Some things never change 

The other day I was walking through the
William Pitt Union when I came across a poster
from the local socialist group armouncing a new
meeting to plot the end of capitalism and the
beginnings of a socialist workers’ paradise. It got
me thinking: Don’t these people know that the
Berlin Wall came down? Socialism failed
Miserably. Get over it, people. Go home. Watch
“Buffy the Vampire Slayer” or something

Socialism, as theory, may sound noble to

7 some. The world, they believe, would be happy

and wonderful if the State could magically pro-
vide everyone with good jobs and a guaranteed
income. The devil, of course, is in the details.
History has shown that state—owned, com-
mand-and-control economies are painfully inef-
ﬁcient and bureaucratic. Socialist nations in
Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia show
the same pattern again and again: Natural

resources are aggressively exploited, innovative '

ideas are breezily cast aside, and amateurs whose
ideological loyalty counts for more
than their’ know—how are put in
charge. Instead of creating a classless
society, socialism has created a two-

concentrates power and wealth for their own
enjoyment while the poor toil away to support
them. In effect, the rich get richer and ﬂie poor
get poorer. This is power to the people?

The authors of the recent book “'Ihe

‘ Commanding Heights” outline many of the fail-

ines of socialism One particularly illustrative
example of the failure of socialism was India.

Enthralled with what he referred to as the “bright 7

ﬂame” of socialism, Prime  Jawaharlal
Nehru attempted to turn his country into a work-
ers’ paradise modeled on the Soviet Union.
Eschewing free trade and putting his faith in gov-
emment-nm industry, Nehru created an econom-
ic system that the authors of “The Commanding
Heights” described as “an almost incomprehen-
sible maze of quantitative regulations, quotas,
tariffs, endless peirnits and industrial licenses.”
Ir1dia’s economy, one quarter of which was gov-
emment—owned, suffered while corrupt bureau-
crats grew iich._ '

Another particularly illustrative example of
how socialism was defeated by liberal capitalism

that of Taiwan, and both had per capita incomes
of about $1,000. But in the succeeding decades,
the two nations practiced radically different eco-
nomic agendas. Like many Asian countries,
Taiwan staked its future on a market economy
and free trade, while Peru emulated the path
many South American countries took and adopt-
ed socialism and protectionism as its economic
strategy. The results are striking. Today Taiwan is
a growing economy with a per capita income of

$7,500. Peru is a poor South American power

with a per capita income of $500. The failure of
socialism caused Peruvian presidential candidate

' Mario Vargas Llosa to remark, “You cannot be a

modem man and a Marxist.”

Recently, I took a course here at Pitt on the
Chinese communist party. I was struck by, one
story of agricultinal planners in Beijing ordering

farmers in outlying rural farms to plant their .

seedstwiceas deepasthey typically did, reason-
ing that theircrops would grow twice as large.
The result was a severe famine that saw many
peasants die.

The failure of Marxism and

state-dominated" economies have
collapsed or fallen on hard times. In
Eastern Europe, Aﬁica and Latin America, peo-
ple are increasingly turning away from com-
mand-and—control systems of government and
embracing .tl1e free market China, the world’s
last bastion of communism, has largely aban-
doned the teachings of Karl Marx. Once, state-
rim industry made up. 78 percent of China’s
economy;.in 1995, state-run industry was just 34
percent What was once the last, best hope of
Marxism has today become one of the most
powerful economies on earth.

It’s not diﬂicult to see why Marx and Lenin
have never been more irrelevant. Socialism has

proven to be a colossal bust Advanced by Ivory (

Tower thinkers with little understanding of how
the world works, socialism has ruined nations by

placing  constraints on human ability. In _ .

the emerging global economy, the path to eco-
nomic growth is clean Free trade and minimal
government interference go a long way toward
improving the quality of life for everyone.

THE Prrr News: OPINIONS

Proposed higher education bill provision ludicrous

Zachariah Blott

Columnist

Under next year’s higher education bill,
which Congress is currently considering, a
provision that would suspend federal ﬁnan-
cial assistance to college students who are
convicted of possessing or selling illegal
drugs may be passed.

If this isn’t the dumbest idea I’ve ever
heard of  yada, yada, you know the rest.

I see where the lawmakers are coming
ﬁom: They want to discourage college-age
students from taking bong hits like Cheech
and Chong. But aren’t the laws themselves
setuptodo tltat?Whymakesmetl1esekids
can’t further themselves at all?

Imagine you’re a high school kid who
gets his herbal ﬁx every other weekend for
the sake of chilling outaﬁer a week of class-

es.You do your thing and sit around watch- '

ing television for the rest of the night while
chowing on some microwave burritos.

The point is, it doesn’t aifect your
schooling — you still want to go to ,college
and get a job someday as accountant or
whatever. So you apply to Pitt, get in, take

Rocks forlocks and Psychology 0015, and

continue your extracurricular activity. ,
Then it happens. You and some friends
are in Schenley Park one Saturday dis-
cussing how great the Black Crowes are
over some hybrid bluntage, and Qfﬁcer Sldp
Lacey shows up to bust your ass. Your
group end up having to do the paying-ﬁnes
thing and then ﬁnd out your student aid is
being taken away. ‘ ' '

You now realize a few things. First, you V
can’t go to school for the next year and will _

have to get a McJob. Second, the govern-
ment thought you were committed enough
as a student just last year to give you ﬁnan-
cial aid when you were smoking your weed
unknown to them,rbut now_ that they know,
they’re not sosure you’re an able learner.
Whatthehellisthatallaboufllsthe
government going to convince me that ﬂ]0S6
students who don’t do drugs are much bet-
ter students and need more money than
those who do? I don’t think so. Here’s why:
From personal experience, the two
smartest people I’ve met in my four-plus
years at Pitt were heavy drug users. But they
had no problem getting straight A’s ‘in the
classes they felt like doing well in and they

had I no problem being overly ftmctional i

members of society. ‘
But the government would love to get
them out of school, because these two

should be broom-pushers and fry-peddlers. .

Some, people will add, “But they must
have enough money to get through school if
they’re doing drugs.” These people have
obviously never met a drug user who knew
anything about money management.

People who do drugs have no more
money (in fact, usually less) than college
students who can’t stop buying CDs by
Natalie Imbruglia, Prodigy and whoever

else MTV promotes each week, or someone V

addicted to ptnchasing clothes or drinking

  _-$-sprint.

evay weekend. But don’t tell that to closed-
minded people who would never want to
meet drug users just because their hobbies
are dilferent.

Possibly‘ the lamest reason to support
this bill, I hate to say, was in yesterday’s Pitt
News editorial. It stated, “Keeping in mind
the vast number of students who apply for
federal aid such as Stafford loans, Pell grants
and work study, this is a good strategy for
‘weeding’ out some of the applicants.”

Why is this such a good strategy? Why
wouldn’t cutting aid from groups of students
who have below-average graduation rates
(such as African-Americans) be a good
strategy? Probably because anyone with a
braincanseethatthispracticewoulddis—

criminate against members of the group
who will get through college but need
money to do so. Just like the drug—use crite-
rion would  far too broadly. .

The editorial also stated, “Narcotics
severely undermine academic endeavors.”
How do the members of the Editorial Board
who agreed with this statement (The Pitt
News uses" a majority vote from Editorial
Board members when writing its editorials)
know this unless they are narcotic users
themselves?

I guess they and most of the members
of Congress who want this bill to pass, think
they lmow what they’re talking about If
drugs are so damaging to academic pursuits,
coke—sniﬂ'ers and pill-poppers would all fail

out of school in their freshmen years. But
they don’t; actually, they often excel at the
arts, creative writing and, not-too-uncom-
monly, engineering and the sciences.

Why would they believe this, though,
when they can see the elfects of marijuana
in movies like Friday and in “Saturday
Night Live” sketches? Why would they
acknowledge the fact that most of the litera-
ture wc read in college was written by coke-
heads, alcoholics and heroin users?

T Because facing the facts deprives peo-
ple like supporters of this bill of their igno-
rance, to which they hold onto so tightly.

Zachariah Blott wonders what lawmakers
were smoldng when they thought up this bill.

Sosa should be
this year’s MVP

MVP for _me. '

With all the hype that revolves
around sports, the emphasis on num-
bers, on records, on multi-million dol-
lar contracts and stadium renovations;
this 1998 baseball season has found a
way to emerge from the doldrums of
greed. _

Baseball in America has come

I back from the dead, and this new life

has caught the fire that Americans
thrive upon to get us going, get us

interested, and get us together every-

once in a while.

And what makes this spectacle of
home runs so exceptional and exciting
is that as a country, we finally can
experience something together
besides a war, a double-murder trial or
a sleazy presidentialinvestigation.

This season America’s game has
given something back to the people.

The Yankees have kept the smiles
on our friends in New York. Mark
McGwire has pioneered the chase of
Roger Maris’ home-run record, which
was once thought untouchable.

And Sammy Sosa has played the
role as the underdog, the over—achiev-
ing hero who has won the hearts of
people all over the world.

Sosa’s story is one of a true cham-
pion who has worked his whole life to
be where he ‘is today and who
deserves the honor and recognition he‘
will get.

His modest approach to his new-
found fame is what makes him one of
the most interesting and appealing
characters in the land that loves the
unexpected. '

Living in this hectic place and
getting caught up in my own world, I
often take for granted what Sosa
thanks the Lord for each day.

His dream since he was a kid was
just to get to America, to make a bet-
ter life for his mother and his people
of the Dominican Republic. _

He thanks God and sends his
.mother a patented, loving salute every
chance he gets.

And his appreciation for America
and the people who support him can-
not be disputed.

McGwire would not be as
admired or as happy as he is today if
it weren't for the role Sosa has played
this season. He’s brought back the fun
to baseball and the reality that dreams
can come true.

Regardless of the home-run race,

BLACKSBURG, Va. — "Last year, it
was the game that knocked Virginia Tech
from the top of the Big East standings. This
year, it is-the game that will test the true char-
acterofafootballteamafterithas lostthree
players to injuries.

Tech’s Saturday match-up with Pitt
marks the sixth meeting between the two
schools. Tech holds a 4-1 series advantage
and dominated the young conference rivalry
until last November.

“We are 3-0, but we got Pitt next,” said
Hokie defensive back Loren Johnson. "They
took the Big East championship from us
point-blank. They are playing good football.
They were performing well.”

The Hokies entered Pitt Stadium last

year poised to re-establish dominance as the ‘

team to beat in the Big East. However,
Panther quarterback Pete Gonzalez had
other things in mind Gonzalez picked apart
the Tech defense and threw for 314 yards
and four touchdowns to lead—Pittsburgh to a
30-23 victory.

“I thought Pitt harmnered us last year,”

ration this week and see if we can improve

Pitt head coach Walt Harris was encour-
aged by the performance of his team last
year and said that Saturday’s game will be a
formidable task -for his team.

“”Last year against Virginia Tech, we
had a tough battle,” Hanis said “I was
pleased with our elfort, and [I think] we out-
fought them. We have great respect for that
program Obviously, we have a tremendous
challenge this week on the road and facing a
team that knows, how to win.” ‘

“I think [Lytle] is playing great, and he

Virginia Tech steals recruits out of Pitt’s own backyard

Mario Maehl
Staff Wrlter .

The Virginia Tech Hokies will host
the Pitt Panthers at Lane Stadium on
Saturday in a game that could aﬂect

much more than the Big East standings. ‘

The Hokies are very fond of
Pennsylvania players — they have nine
Pennsylvania products on their roster.
This game could very well be the decid-
ing factor for some of next year’s
recruits.

Three of the Hokies’ Pennsylvania
players —-— fullback Cullen Hawkins, tight
end Bob Slowikowski and defensive end
Ryan Srnithare —-— are from the Pittsburgh
metropolitan area. Smith’s and Hawkins’

fathers also played‘ for the Hokies.
John Ballein, the assistant athletics

director for football operations and also
the recruiting coordinator for Virginia
Tech, explained that the Hokies usually
focus on Virginia, Florida and
Pennsylvania for most of their recruiting.
The assistants on Virginia Tech head
football coach Frank Beamer’s staﬂ’ are
each assigned to recruit in one area. For
instance, Tech offensive line coach Bryan

Stinespring is assigned to Western
Pennsylvania.

Ballein said that recruits choose
Virginia Tech because of the “quality of
football.”

“They have a chance to play in the
Big East, while living in a rural area on a
nice campus,” he said

This past year, the Hokies didn’t sign
any Pennsylvania recruits, but don’t
expect that to continue. The rise of
Virginia Tech football has made the team
one of the top recruiting programs in the
country.

Meanwhile, the Panthers are trying
to get back into the upper echelon of col-
lege football. With the overload of high
school football talent in Western
Pennsylvania, coach Walt Harris could
continue his revival of the Panther foot-
ball program without leaving the area.

The Panthers got off to a good start in
Harris’ first year, ﬁnishing with a 6-6
record and a Liberty Bowl bid. The ben-
eﬁts of this success were immediately
evident, as the Panthers signed two of the
top recruits in the area, tailback Brandon
Williams from Valley High School in
New Kensington and linebacker Amir

Purifoy from Steel Valley High School.
Williams has started in both of the
Panthers’ games this year, and Purifoy
has made some impressive contributions
to the defense.

Many Panther fans saw the talent that _

Western Pennsylvania can produce at last
week’s game against ‘ Penn State. Pitt’s
last-minute drive was stopped mainly by
two former Western Pennsylvania
Interscholastic Athletic League stand-
outs, LaVar Arrington and Brandon
Short. ‘The combined pressure of those
two players ended up being too much for
Panther quarterback Matt Lytle to handle,
and Penn‘ State escaped with a 20-13 vic-
tory. r A

The Panthers were in the rrmning for
both of those recruits, but both players
chose Penn State because of the winning
tradition there. Last week’s game will go
a long way in helping the Panthers move
back up the ladder in college football. If
Harris and the Panthers continue to make
huge strides with Pitt football, it won’t be
long before we see the Big East champi-
onship here at Pitt, as well as the top high
schoolers from the area in Panther jer-
seys.

What is cl hokie anyway?

Melissa Baran

Staff Wrlter

Panthers prowl, lions roar, wild-
cats roam, and eagles soar. What in
the world do hokies do? They gob-
ble.

Yes, at Virginia Tech, the mascot
who religiously rolls" around in the
end zone after each touchdown rep-
resents a long—neck turkey that has
come a long way over the years.

“We redesigned our turkey 11
years ago to appeal to the crowds and
erase any negative connotations,”
said Peg Morse, director of sports
promotions for Virginia Tech.

The school started using the bird
as its mascot sometime between

1892 and 1905. The reason for the"

choice stems from a strange tradi-
tion.

“It has been said that a man
would come on" campus with a turkey
that could pull a small cart,” Morse
said.

This turkey became synonymous

with the university during those‘

years. The name “hokie,” which was

given topthe bird a few years after it '

came into existence, has no direct
relationship to turkeys, or any other
bird, for that matter.

The name was established when
Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical
College changed its name to Virginia
Polytechnic‘ Institute. A student by,
the name of ‘OM. Stull won first
prize in a contest for his “hokie”
yell. Stull claimed that the word had
no meaning and that it was just a fig-
ment of his imagination, as well as
an attention-getter.

This hokieshas changed its face
over the years. In the mid-1920s, the
original colors of crimson and gray
changed to the familiar Chicago
maroon and burnt orange we see
today.

It wasn’t until the mid-’60s that

football field in the form of a long
neck turkey. To most fans, the turkey
wasn’t the toughest and fiercest mas-
cot, so when Peg Morse joined the
promotions staff 11 years ago, she

‘decided to change that image.

“We wanted to keep" tradition and
history alive, but we needed to give
our mascot a tougher, more modern
look,” Morse said.

The new design became a part of
Virginia Tech’s promotional cam-
paign as well.

Morse said she designed the new
hokie to compete with other mascots
in-college athletics. Now the bird is
viewed by many as a friendly animal
with big muscles, appealing to a larg-

er group of people, including chil-
dren.

“Our mascot is so popular it won
back to back national collegiate.mas—
cot championships in 1995 and
1996,” Morse said.

The Hokie has remained one of
the biggest features of Virginia Tech
football games.

“Last year, it was neat to see our
mascot in action with your panther at
the game. It gives [the game] a
lighter element,” Morse said.

Whether it lightens up a Saturday
afternoon football game‘ or repre-
sents a long-standing tradition, the
Virginia Tech Hokie is one tough
turkey. '

The Pittsburgh Steelers added another
local connection by signing free-agent
defensive back John Jenkins, a former Pitt
Panther.

Jenkins received a free-agent invita-
tion to the Steelers’ summer camp at St.
Vmcent’s College in Latrobe.

He lasted through most of the early
stages of camp but was not quite good
enough to make the ﬁnal cut. He has not
been on a team since the Steelers cut him.

“Being a die-hard Steeler fan my
whole life,_I think it’s going to be great
being here,” Jenkins said during camp.

Jenkins has a lot of respect for his
superstar teammates.

“I love it. They may be superstars,’ but
they are some of the nicest guys I have
ever met They are willing to lend a hand
anytime. They have helped me a lot,” he
said of his experience at St. Vmcent’s.

In order to make room for Jenkins, the
Steelers released rookie defensive end
Matt Harper from the practice squad.

Steelers sign John Jenkins

Harper is a free agent out of Texas
Christian University.

Jenkins will be forever remembered
in Pitt football history for his interception
late in the fourth quarter against  to
seal the Panther victory last season.

Miami had the ball on a fourth—and-
5 at the Panthers’ 34-yard line with just
1:25 remaining in the game. Jenkins
picked off the Ryan Clement pass on the
22-yard line to give the Panthers the 21-
17 victory.

Jenkins, from East McKeesport, Pa.,
played’ three years at free safety for Pitt
before moving to comerback under the
tutelage of new defensive coordinator
Larry Coyer.

Jenkins’ three interceptions tied him
with Tray Crayton for the 1997 team
lead.‘ Jenkins racked up 82 tackles, two
fumble recoveries and one forced fum-
ble.

Jenkins’ leadership was also an
important factor. As one of the seniors in

year, he set an example by playing with
heart.

The Lady Panther volleyball team
broke its losing streak by beating Akron last
weekend.

Pitt swept the Zips 3-0, winning 15-9,
15-9 and 15-4. The Lady Panthers’ 33.6 hit-
ting percentage dwarfed that of Akron,
which had a dismal 7.9 hitting percentage.

Peggy Meinhart and Jemra Birkel led
the Lady Panthers with 11 kills apiece. Stacy
Renick and‘ Marcia Thiesen followed with
nine and eight kills, respectively.

Setter Tara Haefner once again had
almost all of the team’s sets, registering 40
of Pitt’s 44 on the aftemoon.

Renick, Melissa Alpers and captain
Kelly Meyers each registered a service ace
in the Pitt’s convincing victory.

This _win moves the Lady Panthers’
record to 5-5 for the year, but they haveyet
to play a conference game. ‘

Pitt travels to Harvard this weekend for
a tournament before reuiming home on Oct.
3 to host St. John’s.

THE Pin News

IT

Kncivisii picks this weekend's games

We are now in the fourth week of the
season, and like a lot of schools, Pitt is
getting into its conference schedule. The
meat of the conference schedules doesn’t
come for a couple of weeks, but it’s nice
to see some games on the slate that actu-
ally mean something. Here are my picks
for this week:

Pitt (+17 1/2) at Virginia Tech ‘

Seventeen and a half points is a joke.
Pitt’s defense shut down Penn State last
weekend, so there’s no reason to believe
Pitt won’t be able to stop the Hokies,
especially when Virginia Tech is without
starting quarterback Al Clark. Tech’s
defense isn’t’ quite what Penn State’s was,
either, so look for the Panthers to put
some points on the board. Pitt will win
the game, let alone beat the spread.
Pitt 24, Virginia Tech 17

Temple (+9) at Maryland

Neither team is very good, but the
Owls aren’t quite as bad as their 0-3
record. It’s been a few weeks of close
games, and it’s about time for new coach
Bobby Wallace’s option attack to click.
Look for Temple quarterback Kevin
Harvey to have a big game on the ground.
Temple 32, Maryland 24

Purdue (+7 1/2) at Notre Dame
Despite the tough loss to Michigan
State two weeks ago, Notre'Dame is back

at its familiar spot as one of the nation’s
elite teams. Quarterback Jarius Jackson
and tailback Autry Denson provide the
Irish with a good offensive attack, and
with the game at South Bend, Ind., Notre
Dame should roll with no problem.
Notre Dame 28, Purdue 10

UCLA (-6 1/2) at Miami

Despite losing to
Virginia Tech in
overtime last week,
Miami is again one
of the top teams in
the Big East. But it’s
not good enough to
beat UCLA. At 2-0
and ' No. 5 in the
country, the Bruins are a legitimate
national championship contender. The
difference in the game is at quarterback,
where Heisman hopeful Cade McNown
is worlds ahead of Miami’s Scott
Covington.
UCLA 27, Miami 10

Boston College (-7 1/2) at Louisville .

Boston College is theearly surprise
of the Big East, sitting atop the confer-
ence with a 3-0 mark. The Eagles have
one more softie in Louisville on Saturday
before their schedule gets hard. The game
is at Louisville, _but head coach Tom
O’Brien ‘and his Eagles should have no
trouble crushing the Cardinals.

 

Boston College 25, Louisville 13

Tiilsa (-14) at West Virginia '
With a win over Michigan and last
Saturday’s 70-14 stomping of Rutgers,’ it

now appears Syracuse is the team to beat‘

in the Big East. That should light a ﬁre
under West Virginia, which was the pre-
season favorite to win‘ the conference.
The’ Mountaineers will want
to prove they are the confer-
ence powerhouse by beating
up on a softie (Tulsa) like the
Orangemen did last week.
Star tailback Amos Zereoue
and quarterback Mark
Bulger are healthy, so look
for the points to pile up.
West Virginia 44, Tulsa 17

This week’s best bet:

‘Northwestern (+10), at Wisconsin

The Badgers are my sleeper team in
the Big Ten; only Ohio State is better.
Last week, bruising tailback Ron Dayne
became the school’s all-time leading
rusher. There was a carnpus-wide cele-
bration in Madison, so “The Great
Dayne” should be ﬁred up this week.
Virrsconsin is unsettled at quarterback, but
that doesn’t matter. We’re talking about
Wisconsin here. Dayne is unstoppable
behind the Bagders’ mammoth offensive
line.

Wisconsin 24,.Northwestern 10

HOKIES

so many junior—college guys he has brought
in),

FROM. PAGE 8

Phil Clarke leads the Panther defense
that will face a Hokie offense that averages
34 points per game. Clarke, a Big East all-

' conference pick last year, is the strength of

the middle linebacker position for Hanis.
Defensive tackle Carl Bradley said he is
conﬁdent that there will be no decline in the
Hokie performance Saturday.
“Ourbacki.lpsarejustasgoodasour
starters,” Bradley said “We’re just ready to
play football. We’re using each other as
motivation. I think that there aren’t any indi-
vidual players out there e we play as one.
We have great team chemistry.”

Pitt enters the game with a 1-1 .

after coming oﬂ’ a 20-13 home loss to No. 8
Penn State. Harris was disappointed that his
team could not ﬁnish off the Nittany lions
and feels that the Panthers have something
to prove against the Hokies.

“We played very hard against Penn
State and didn’t get the job done,” Harris
said “We have to prove to ourselves that we
can play in all phases well. We have a long,
long way to go to bring this football-team
bag 9’

Beamer said that he was impressed
with Pitt’s performance against Penn State.

“For Pitt, when you look at the tape of
Penn State, I didn’t see anything there that
showed Pitt didn’t belong on the ﬁeld with
that great Penn State football team,” Beamer
said. “Pitt belonged —— they had a chance to
win the game in the fourth quarter.”

Eootball

To the 12"‘ Man;

Congratulations!!!  

Without you last Saturday’s game against Penn State would not have been
such a thrill. Your support of our team was overwhelming. The atmosphere was
exciting and you ‘made Pitt Stadium an intimidating place to play. It was great to
see you in the stadium early with your game face on.

We are sorry we didn’t get the job done for you.
Rebuilding the great Panther tradition can not be done without you, the
12"‘ man. This is why we need your support at all of our football games. Continue

to come early and make Pitt Stadium intimidating for visiting teams.

Again, I want to personally thank you on behalf of the Pittsburgh Panther
Football team. ~

12”‘ Man.......You  Make the Difference

  Sincerely,

w¢d'Al¢wL
