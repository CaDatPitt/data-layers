The Pennsylvania House GOP
introduced abudget proposal
on Tuesday that calls for a 25
percent reduction to the Uni-
versity’s funding, nearly half of
what Corbett proposed more than
two months ago. The Republican
Governor called for a 52 percent
cut that would reduce funding
to the University of Pittsburgh
from $168 million to $80 -million.

Budget dispute continues

Corbett < 1

The House Republicans’ plan
would mitigate the cuts from
education by making much
larger cuts to welfare spending.
_ The House GOP plan

would cut an additional $470
million to the Department of
Public Welfare from Corbett’s
budget proposal. Corbett’s pro-
posal already calls fora $607
million reduction from Public
Welfare, making the total pro-
posed cuts just over $1 billion. .

House Majority Leader
Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, also
spoke at the press conference.
He characterized the cuts on the
Department of Public Welfare as
an attack on wasteful spending.

“With respect to the Gov-
ernor’s proposal, yes, we are put-
ting less into welfare, but that’s
because waste, fraud and abuse
has to be rooted out,” he said.

Neither the House Re-
publicans nor Corbett would
be open to raising existing tax-
es. or introducing new ones.

Both proposed bud-
gets would spend $27.3 bil-
lion, a 3 percent reduction
from last year’s budget total.

House Republicans
stressed that their budget would
come in on time and not increase

' taxes or include any borrowing.

TheinformationthatPitt’s
funding might not be cut as drasti-
cally as previously thought came as
good news to some Pitt students.
Others , said they weren’t follow-
ing the budget news too closely.

One student who is
following the news is econom-
ics graduate student Ray Miller.
Miller said that he has a full-tu-
ition scholarship, so he wouldn’t
be as directly affected by the
cuts as other students would.

Miller said he pre-
ferred tax increases rather
than cutting funds to the De-

partment of Public Welfare or

education spending, given the
choice. Though neither would
be a perfect situation, he said. .
Another Pitt student who
has tiesto both education and
public welfare spending is senior
Lauren Arnita, a social work major.
Arnita said that she was
“very much disturbed” by Cor-
bett’s plan to cut funding to the
state-related institutions because,
as an in—state student, she would A
be directly affected by it.
Chancellor Mark Nor-
denberg said during a news con-
ference in March that Pitt will
deﬁnitely have to increase tuition
with the proposed budget cuts.
But she said she would
only support the cuts to the Depart-
ment of Public Welfare if they were
made to programs that she thought
could absorb them. Public Welfare
programs that could face cuts are
include Medicaid, Food Stamps,
and various housing programs.
One proposed solu-
tion to the budget crisis is tax-
ing the natural gas industry, but
Arnita characterized that plan

‘as a “double-edged sword.” She

thought it could negatively affect
the people working in the drill-
ing industry, even though it would
provide revenue for the state.

’ One motion she un-
equivocally said she supported
was cuts to legislators’ salaries.
She said this conviction developed
after she attended Pitt Day in Har-
risburg, where students get the

e opportunity to lobby members

of the Pennsylvania General As-
sembly, and observed legislators
on Facebook and asleep while in
session. I

about the student population.
““She’s extremely organized and
down-to-business,” Homaksaid. “But
also with a friendly face.”
He believes that Crossley pos-

sessed a respect and concern for .
students in the law school that will

be missed when she leaves the posi-
tion. .

“She’s been great to work with,”
Homak said. “She really cares about
student input and the student voice
at Pitt Law School.” .

Crossley introduced a number of
initiatives during her time as dean.
Amongthese initiativeswas arevision
of the ﬁrst—year curriculum,.whichwill
take effect to begin the 2011-12 aca-
demic year.

“She put more of an emphasis
on including classes that focus on
practical skills students will need as
practicinglawyers,”Deasy said. “They
were excellent changes to move the
curriculum toward being realistic to
the challenges a lawyer faces in prac-
tice and away from the theoretical
approach.” - '

Crossley, who has taught classes
and published work every year she has
been dean, was also instrumental in
creating Pitt School ofLaw’s Washing-
ton, D.C., program The programpro-
vides students withthe opportunity to
spendasemesterinthe capital, where
they can participate in externships in
government agencies and nonproﬁt
organizations whilebuilding career
connections.

“She’s been very supportive of cre-I

atingopportunities for studentsto get
that experience and to job—n'etwork,”
Deasy said. _ '

i She will still continue to teach at

the school, something she didn’t get -
as much of a chance to do during her’

time as dean.

' “With the administrative respon-
sibilities of being clean, I have taught
only one course ayear. As a lawfaculty
member for 15 years before becom-
ing dean, I loved teaching, and I look
forward to once again being able to
devote a large portion of my profes-
sional time to i ”

Inaddition to herwork on student-

leaves legacy at Pitt

aimed initiatives, Crossley participat-
ed inworkas dean to positively impact
the larger Pittsburgh community.

. Two years ago, she worked with

Pitt faculty to form Pitt’s Innovation

Practice Institute, which provides
lawyers to local businesses.

“She’s enhanced Pitt’s reputation
through engagement with the com-
munity,” Hornak said.

Crossley’s impact went well be-
yond her effect onjsuidents. She was
astrongsupporter ofresearch among
the law school faculty members.

“She has encouraged and sup-
ported faculty research in all the
meaningful senses, with resources
and by spotlighting the good work
our faculty does,” Associate Dean of
Research David Harris said.

Harris said that the role of a dean
is to ﬁnd what students and faculty
are skilled at and interested in and
to.foster those skills and interests.

1 He believes Crossley ﬁlled that role

well. 7
“She’s done a good job forus here,”
he said. I

Chinese medical students to come to Pitt

Gwenn Barney
Senior Staﬁ Writer

Beginning in 2013, Pitt’s School of Medicine
will welcome medical and graduate students
from Beijing’s Tsinghua University as part of
an exchange program considered to be the
ﬁrst of its kind.

Between 25-45 students hailing from Tsin-
ghua’s “experimen ” medical school, will
spend two years at Pitt studying biomedical
research. Tsinghua is considered to be one
of the top science-oriented schools in China,
even though it was instituted as a medical
school in 2001.

An agreement forthe exchange was signed
in China on April 24 by officials from both
Pitt and Tsinghua. Dr. Arthur Levine, dean
of Pitt’s School of Medicine, and Dr. Yigong
Shi, dean of Tsinghua’s School of Life Sciences,
spearheaded the initiative. I

Shi could not be reached for comment.

Dr. Jeremy Berg is expected to lead the
program once he arrives at Pitt in]une from
his current post as the director of the National

Institute of General Medical Sciences at the V‘

National Institute of Health. He will take up
the position of Associate‘Vice Chancellor for
Healthy Policy and Plarming, as well as being
a professor for Pitt’s School of Medicine.
“[Shi] wants to expose his students to cer-
tain aspects of how we undertake biomedical

research in America,” Levine said.
According to Levine, these aspects include

peer reviews, merit-based research and the D

National Institute of Health’s presence in these
practices.

Levine said it is too soon to determine pre— '

cisely what sort of work the Tsinghua students
will conduct when they arrive.
“They are not coming for two [more]

Jim Mezger:

It ives students more exposure to .

years at Pitt with an initial period of short
rotations to determine the best ﬁt for their
research interests.”

Plans for the exchange program began
in February 2011, when Levine and Shi were
introduced through e-mail by Berg. Shi was a

graduate student of Berg’s atjohns Hopkins .

University.
“I became aware that Levine was looking

years,” Levine said. “It’s much too prema-
ture to say.” A '

Berg said that although it is too early to
know what type of lab work the students will
perform, ofﬁcials at Pitt are currently working
on putting those details in place.

“Dr. Levine is in the process of identifying
a large number of potential mentors at Pitt for
the students from Tsinghua,” Berg said in an
e-mail. “The selection of these laboratories
will determine the sorts of projects that the
students will work on. The expectation is that
each student will spend approximately two

into potential partnerships involving research,
medical education and, potentially, clinical
service in China,” Berg said in an e-mail. “I
mentioned to him that my former graduate
student, Yigong Shi,’ had moved back to Chi-
na (from Princeton) and was in a leadership

A role at Tsinghua, one of the most outstanding

universities in China, and that Shi might be

At that time, Tsinghua had just started a

on developing leaders in academic medicine
and research, and Shi was pursuing possible

partnerships with leading universities in the
United States including Johns Hopkins and
Harvard, Berg said.

Sure enough, Berg’s estimation‘ proved
correct. Levine and Shi built on their original
e-mail correspondence through phone calls
and eventually in—person visits.

“The medical students at Tsinghua are
outstanding based on our interactions with
them directly during our recent visit to Bei-
jing. They are eager to learn about how to do
biomedical research and will bring energy
and creativity to the already outstanding
environment at Pitt. They are also likely to
be future leaders in biomedical research in
China,” Berg said.

Berg has high hopes that this partnership
between the schools will continue to grow
and develop.

“We hope that the relationship started with
this program between_Pitt and Tsinghua will
continue to develop over the years, although
it is hard to say what forms this evolution will
take at this early stage.” Berg said.

Those associated with Pitt’s medical school
see the exchange as a positive opportunity
for Pitt. -

“Collaboration of that sort’s a good thing,”
Pitt medical school graduate and current
UPMC resident Jim Mezger said. “It gives
students more exposure to what’s going on
at other places in the world.” I

EDITORIAL

Twitter gaffes
not worth ban

Sometimes, especially on social-
networking sites, the temptation to
broadcast impromptu observations
can be overpowering — even if a
harsh backlashis all but ensured.

Although websites like Twitter
and Facebook are invaluable when
it comes to connecting with friends
and sharing informaﬁon, they’ve also
facilitated more than a few public
relations headaches for professional
sports teams. _

As football fans are no doubt
aware, Pittsburgh Steelers running
back Rashard Mendenhall took to
Twitter on May 2 to protest the rev-
elry immediately following Osama
bin Laden’s death. “It’s amazing how
people can HATE a man they have
never evenlheard speak,” he wrote,
adding in a subsequent tweet, “I be-
lieve in God. I believe'we’re ALL his
children. And I believe HE is the ONE
and ONLY judge.”

More incendiary, perhaps, was
the post he deleted: “We’ll never
know what really happened,” he said
in reference to Sept. 11. “I just have
a hard time believing a plane could
take a skyscraper down demolition
style.” ‘

Unsurprisingly, Mendenhall’s
comments drew the ire of more than
a few Steelers fans, as well as from
the team’s president, Art Rooney II,
who said in a statement Tuesday that
he found it “hard to explain or even
comprehend what [Mendenhall]
meant with his recent Twitter com-
ments.” Two days later, in an equally
predictable move, the sports apparel
company Champion severed the ath-
lete’s corporate sponsorship.

One proposition, however —— set
forth by Beaver County Times colum-
nist Mark Madden and dissected in
a subsequent USA Today article —
caught us off-guard: Madden says

that the Steelers should, among other I

things, “[b]arplayers from social net-

working. No Twitter, no Facebook,
nothing of the sort. No tangible good
can come from it.” _

For avid Internet users like our-
selves, this is a startling claim. Awell-
managed, tactful online presence can
have irrefutably positive effects. As
USA Today notes, Steelers receiver
Hines Ward maintains a thriving Fa-
cebook fan page, in which he posts

frequent, goocl—natured statuses on V
- subjects rangingfrom Mother’s Day

to “Dancing With the Stars.” Often,
more than 1,000 fans will respond
with comments and “likes.”

But more importantly, banning
athletes from Facebook and Twitter
would not preclude embarrassing
incidents. Even if the Steelers were to
retreat from the Internet, their ability
to make provocative comments at,
say, a press conference would hardly
be diminished. Limiting athletes’ on-
line engagementwill not fundamen-
tally temper their propensity to be
outspoken. '

Ultimately, social media is what
people make ofit: achance for expand-

. ing personal appeal or an unrivaled

opportunity for self-‘destruction.
Although athletes must understand
that their actions online as well_as in
person will have consequences — in
this case, lost corporate sponsorship
and the wrath of many blue-blooded
Pittsburghers — they should not be
subject to a limitation of freedoms
because of a few unseemly incidents.
The possibilities these mediums af-
ford — connecting with friends as
well as celebrities — far outweigh
their negative side effects.

in other ways be seen as a positive

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Bin Laden’s problematic demise

. Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

There is always something deeply
satisfying about being able to ac-
complish the impossible. One task
that long fell under such a category
was the ﬁnding and killing of Osama
bin'Laden, which was accomplished
last week after 10 years of effort. But
although his death is very good news
for the United States, and although
I am as glad as the next person that
he’s dead, there are a few things
that might be lost in the revelry that
shouldn’t be. _

Again, bin Laden’s death is a good
thing. The man plotted and executed
acts of murder against men, women
and children, killing .Christians,jews
and Muslims alike. However, the cel-

' ebration ofhis death is disquieting.
' The sight of Americans dancing in .

the streets waving ﬂags and chant-.
ing slogans is too reminiscent of
countless scenes we’ve witnessed

V in the Middle East where the death _
' of Americans was often celebrated

with equal glee. This is not to imply
a moral equivalence between the glee

of those who cheered Sept. 11 and

those who cheered the demise of its
architect. This is not to blame Ameri-
cans for being happy. However, it’s
easy for our enemies to draw a moral
equivalence between us and them
with images like that.

Even without consideration for
the propagandaaspects, public cel-
ebration of bin Laden’s death just

"doesn’t seem appropriate. Many *

people have struggled, died and done
nasty things while we slept quietly in
our beds in order to give us this tri-
umph, and thus it doesn’t seem right
to celebrate as one would celebrate
victory in a football game.

Now is also not the time to be- ,

come complacent about terrorism,
tempting as it would be to do so.
There are organizations other than
al-Qaida no less fanatical in their
dedication to the destruction’ of the
United States, Israel, Europe and
moderate Islam, and these organi-
zations are wholly unaffected by the
death of bin Laden. -

Al—Qaida itself is decentralized
and has franchises in Yemen, Egypt
and elsewhere. These franchises have
become used to having al—Qaida’s
senior leadership not really in con-
tact with them, meaning that these

Matt Schaffl Cartoonist

subgroups are used to thinking and

acting independently. Accordingly, '
. killing the man at the top might not

be as destructive as we would hope:
acorporation wouldn’t fold if its CEO

_ were to die. Although dispatching bin

Laden hinders al—Qaida’s operations
and although the intelligence gained
from the raid in Pakistan helps crip-
ple the group further, it is a mistake
to drink al-Qaida is ﬁnished.

There are a few other aspects
of this operation that aren’t really
being emphasized because it would
be embarrassing for the Obama
administration to talk about them.
First and foremost among these is
where the intelligence about bin

Laden’s whereabouts came from. On

“NBC Nightly News with Brian Wil-
liams” last week, CIA director’ Leon
Panetta admitted that some of the

. intelligence came from “enhanced

interrogation techniques,” which

had been widely viliﬁed by many

liberals as both illegal and ineffec-
tive. Now if those techniques were
used, why aren’t liberals screaming
about how the killing of bin Laden
itselfwas tainted and illegal, and that

crite? And if some of that intelligence
came from enhanced interrogation,
’doesn’t that shift the debate over its
use, at least somewhat?

The operation that took bin Lad-g

en is also attributable to the policies -

of George W. Bush. The CIA and FBI
intelligence apparatus thatwas able
to ﬁnd out where bin Laden was hid-

’ ingwas not built in a day, but ‘rather

over a period of years, with some'of
it coming during the Bush adminis-
tration. Thejoint Special Operations
Command,lwhich oversaw SEAL
Team Six, the team that carried out
the operation, was reviled as — in
the words of New Yorker reporter
Seymour Hersh —‘—_ an “Executive As-
sassination Ring” during the Bush
years. Andis it not astonishingthatin
the War on Terror; Obama is continu-
ing the Bush-erapolicies, so much so
that the Left is complaining about it?
Does the killing ofbin Laden not sug-
gest that perhaps Bush or the people
surrounding him weren’t the bunch
of apes they were said to be? Or at

. the very least that some Bush—era

policies work? -
So while it is certainly good news
that bin.Laden has ﬁnally faced the

ultimate justice, it is a bit ghoulish A

to celebrate the news in the streets,-
not to mention premature to assume
that this means an end to the war on
terrorism. It is also important to look
beyond the simple fact that bin Laden
is dead and note that it was partially
because of the highly controversial
policies of the Bush era, continued by
the current administration, that such
a feat could be accomplished.

Letter to the

‘ editor

To the Editor,

OnApril 25, The PittNevvs published

a story titled, “Missing Books’
Locations Unknown Due to Library
Inventory System.” At best, the

article is misleading and gives avery j

incomplete picture of the actual
situation related to the Hillman
Library’s book collection.

The University Library System
(ULS) does not routinely conduct
inventoriesof all the 6.2 million
books in its-holdings. In fact,

- inventories are .no longer routine

activities for academic libraries of

lsizebecausealibraryhastobeclosed

for this to occur and it is very time-
consurning. Whilethiscanbedone in
a high school library at the end of the
school year, Hillman and the other
ULS libraries are not closed over the
summer. Instead, aswithall research
libraries, we rely on a system which
ﬂags abookas missing if someone is
actually looking for it and itis not on
the shelfas expected. We do routinely
print out thelistingofmissingbooks
and those deemed to be in demand
are replaced. » l . »
Book loss is a. product of many
factors, not the least of which is the

conversion oflibrariesfrom closedto .

open stacks beginning in the 1960s.
Closed stacks prevent book loss, but
the trade-off is lack of access to the
collection by users.‘ ‘

We continue to work very hard to
ensure that the books owned by the
ULS are available for all of our users.
But no system is foolproof, and books
do go missingforavariety of reasons.
We will continue to replace those we
know are missing and in demand so
that our collections areas relevant to
the needs of faculty and students as
we can possibly make them.

‘—Fl_our Bab ’ takes t  e cake in film com u etition

Randi Alu
Staffwri ter

At the end of a ﬁlm competition,
a flour baby won out over saved
parking spaces and ﬁrst kisses.
The Steeltown Film Factory
Competition is a screenwriting
contest in which ﬁlmmaking-
hopefuls, while being taken
through every aspect of the
ﬁlmmaking process, are pared
down until a winner is selected to
receive $30,000 to produce his
ﬁlm. Participants must be from
Pittsburgh/Southwestern, Pa.
This year’s winner was Car-
negie Mellon and Duquesne
alumnus Christopher Dimond,
who wrote “Flour Baby.” The
script centers on a young wom-
an who ﬁnds connections to her
dark past and experience with
pregnancy through a school
project involving the care of a
mock baby made of a flour bag.
“Flour Baby” won out against two
other scripts — “Savesies” by
Pitt law school graduate. Philip
Beard and “First Kiss” by CMU
student Yulin Kuang — i'n the

“Final Pitch” event on April 30 at
Carnegie Mellon, where the uni-
versity’s drama students acted
out all three screenplays prior to
the ﬁnal judgement by the expert
panel. _
“That’s why we started the
Film Factory. No one grew up
in Pittsburgh knowing the ﬁlm
industry,” said Steeltown Film
Factory’s executive producer,

Carl Kurlander. The Film Fac—.

tory developed out of a Pitt pro-
gram started by Kurlander called
Pitt in Hollywood. The program
became so popular that it even-
tually led to the creation of the
nonproﬁt in 2003, according to
Kurlander. '

The “Final Pitch” panel was
composed of experienced mem-
bers of the ﬁlm ‘industry — Kim
Moses,_ executive producer of
“Ghost Whisperer;” Nancy Moss-
er, Pittsburgh casting for “The
Perks of Being a Wallﬂower;”
Ian Sander, executive producer
of “Ghost Whisperer,” and Bob
Kusbit, executive producer of
MTV’s “Made.”

This year’s winner, Dimond,
first heard about The Steeltown

Film Factory while taking Kur-
lander’s screenwriting class at

Pitt. It was in that class he dis~ .
_covered his love for screenwrit-

ing, and he soon went on to get
a graduate degree in the subject
from CMU. To Dimond, Pitts-
burgh seems to be a prime place
for movie making.

“Pittsburgh is a literal and
metaphorical conﬂuence where

you’ve got a lot of ideas and dif— 1

fer-ent backgrounds converging
with one__ another, and often
times that leads to interesting
conflicts,” Dimond said.

A particular Pittsburgh
“ﬂavor” shines through in the
sharp, dark jokes found in ‘fFlour
Baby.”

“I think it captures a humor —

» a kind of ironic, sardonic humor

that you see in a lot of Pittsbur-
ghers. It’s a tough town, not ter-
ribly distant from its blue—collar
roots,” Dimond said.

That darkness was . what
piqued the Steeltown group’s
interest.

“It was a really great script. It
was interesting to have such seri-
ous subject matter tackled with

such grace and a bit of humor,”
said Steeltown Entertainment
Project producer Lisa Smith.

A former English teacher at
the all—male high-school Cen-
tral Catholic, Dimond said that
his time as a student as well as a
teacher in local Catholic schools
impacted his work, including
“Flour Baby.”

-“This script was affected pret-
ty intensely by my experience
in Pittsburgh Catholic schools.
I think religion is something
that’s very important to a lot of
Pittsburghers. Particularly in the
suburbs where I grew up, that
sort of inﬂuence is very strong,
as is the importance of athletics,”
the screenwriter said. “So I think
that there are a lot of factors that
came into play with this script
on issues and themes that are
prevalent in Pittsburgh.”

As a male instructor who
taught males, Dimond did not
come into direct contact with a
story such as the one that un-
folds in “Flour Baby.” But the
tone and culture of the scenarios
he depicts are drawn from his
real-life experiences‘ — like the

j ' Kenny Ong I Staff Photographer
Carnegie Mellon students performed readings of each of the three competing scripts during the “Final Pitch” of the Steeltown Film Factory Competition on April 30. At the end,

Duquesne and CMU alumnus Christopher Dimond won for his screenplay “Flour Baby.”

“flour—baby” project hetwas as-
signed as a high school senior.

--I-Ie thinks the ﬁlm has abroad

appeal, especially in dealing with
current social issue such as teen
pregnancy.

“It taps into some issues and
themes that are really prevalent
in the world today and that a lot
of people can relate to. They’re
important, and they’re themes
that need to be discussed, need
to be examined. I think it’s a story
that needs to be told, and perhaps
hasn’t yet been told in the way in
the script,” Dimond said‘.

Though Kurlander made simi-
lar observations, he feels that
Dimond’s script has even more
substance than just what is found
in these ideas.

“What captured attention
about ‘Flour Baby’ was that it
was both funny and a really hard
subject,” he said. “You know, like
you’re not sure if the girl has had
an abortion —— it was like ‘Teen

‘Mom,’ but more complex — more

interesting. It really felt like a

, movie.”

with the drama students at Car-
negie Mellon who acted out the
script.

“I thought they did a fantas-
tic job. I am always incredibly
impressed by the level of talent
in the students there. I was re—_
ally, really. fortunate to have the
opportunity to work with them.
They brought so much to the

‘script — they really brought it
. to life,” Dimond said.

Dimondhas a special connec-

- tion to Carnegie Mellon as well as

to Pitt. Kurlander was Dimond’s
screenwriting teacher at Pitt and
because of such relationships,
Kurlander —— who still holds his
position at Pitt — did not par-
ticipate in the judging.
Steeltown Film Factory has

been a great support for its par-

“It’s not oftentimes in this
business that you find anyone
who believes in your work, and
to have people believing in it to a
level of giving you the resources
to bring that work to life — it’s
a really special thing,” Dimond
said. .
Dimond plans to begin shoot-
ing his short ﬁlm in August and
has already begun pre-produc-
tion such as casting. He is not
a stranger to writing, — he has
written for stage plays —. buthe
believes this will be a;stepping
stone to future film ~.»produc-

“One of the reasons that I
wantedto enter this contest was
to start to explore that world

more — to develop my skills in
screenwriting and have a bit of
an entryway to the field and in-
dustry. I have learned a lot from
this process and improved as a
screenwriter through this pro-
cess,” Dimond said. '- ‘
In addition to the prize mon-
ey, “Flour Baby” will also receive
the chance to play at the Three

Portal 1 9'

for the Pit course “Narrative and Technol-
ogy _ - ‘

If you’re familiar with the ending of the
original game, it might be diﬁicult to imagine
a sequel, but Portal 2 absolutely delivers. The
cleverness and ingenuity of the original con-
tinue in_the second installment, bringing out
the themes of insanity and corruption of power
present in the original.

Abig change tothis sequel is the addition of

the cooperative mode. Players can joinfriends

 

and others online to play as two droids, Atlas ‘S
and P—body, who each have portal guns and
must work together to solve test chambers —
in-game challenges.

Though the increasing popularity of Portal
does demonstrate that it is successful as both
a narrative and a game — its latter role being
the more obvious — the story itselfis compel-
ling when given a second glance. The game is
extremely intellectual and clever and has de-
veloped fans who amuse themselves by reciting
inside jokes such as, “the cake is a lie.”

In the original Portal, the player learns about
the Aperture Science Enrichment Center (where
the player, as the character Chell, wakes up),
previous test subjects, the Weighted Compan-
ion Cube and, most importantly, GLaDOS, the
artificial intelligence unit in control of the En-
richment Center through the game space and
narrative voice that guides the action.

GLaDOS is generally the conveyor of infor-
mation. She explains the uses of the portal gun,
provides essential information needed to com- C
plete some levels and explains certain aspects
of the game’s physics. .

’ Portal 2 is much heavier on the storyline
than its predecessor, butthis does not take away

from gameplay in anyway. Ilnlike the ﬁrst game,
in which the only characters are Chell — the
player’s avatar —— and GLaDOS, the second in-
troduces the playertomany new characters. One
is Wheatley, 'anAI unit who wakes test subjects,
and another is Cavejohnson, the deceased CEO
of Aperture Science. . —

Just those few characters are so complex that
it is difficult to provide simple labels to describe
them and their roles. ' ' ‘

GLaDOS maintains her informat:ion—con— '

veying role, albeit bitterly after the events of

V the previous game. She still explains the game’s ‘

physics once again, asthere are new objects and
materials that the player encounters -— such as
 made from sunbeams and gels that
cover objects and change how they react to other
objects. Repulsion gel, for example, causes what
it coats to bounce off of things. ‘
Johnson ﬁlls the role of GLaDOS for some
parts of the sequel. His character is as intrigu-
ing as GLaDOS’s was in the first He also is not

exactly what he initiallyappears to be. Any more -

elaboration would spoil the plot. .

The game space has greatly changed since
the original Portal — the facility has deterio-
rated without GLaDOS’s control. This makes
the game difficult at some times because the
clean, hospital—like test areas are dilapidated
and disorganized now. Yet the disheveled and
malfunctioning rooms makes for some great
lines from GLaDOS, The bowels of the Aperture
Science Enrichment Center are actually the main
areas of action in the sequel, making it faster-
paced and still visually stimulating.

Portal and Portal 2 are both great if you like
thought—provoking, darkly hilarious games.
See you in space. _ 4 .

Seniors br

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

The ﬁve—member senior class of

the Pitt; softball team became the

.winningest class in the university’s
history with its 112th career victory,
a 6-5‘win over Rutgers on April 30.
Five wins later, the seniors have col-
lected 117 career victories and are
looking to add more in the Big East
Tournament this week. V *
Not only have the senior Pan-
thers — Ashley Amistade, Cory
Berliner,_Alyssa 0’Connell, Reba
Tutt and Ashlyn Zellefrow — earned
more victories than any other group,
they’ve_ also been instrumental in
leading .this_year’s ‘team to a 34-16
regular season record and a 13-8

ﬁnish in the-Big East.
I Both totals markthe bestﬁgures .

in the program’s history.

“The seniors have contributed so .

muchto the program,” head coach
Holly Aprile said. “I am extremely
proud of all of them and the tone
they haveset for the future of our
program.” ‘

After‘ their record-setting

regular season play, the Panthers
earned the No. 6 seed in the Big
East Championship and will face
No.3 Syracuse on Thursday in the
ﬁrst round. Pitt and ‘Syracuse did

not face each other in the regular’

season this year.The Panthers have
won 10 of their last 12 games and
hope to continue that winning trend
well into the postseason, where ——
according to Tutt —— the team will

_ approach its games with the same

attitude as it did during the regular
season.“We know that this is the
championship, but we also know
that we cannot overthink anything,”
Tutt said. “Our hitting and pitching
have been consistent and successful
throughout the year, and we know
that if that continues, we will be
ﬁne.” _ 3 h
‘The Big East Tournament berth
makes the third for Pitt’s senior
class. The Panthers earned the No.
6—seed for thesecond consecutive
season and if the Panthers defeat
Syracuse, they’ll face the winner
of No. 2 seed Depaul and.No. 7 seed
Rutgers. Last year, Pitt fell to Lou-
isville 9-1 in its ﬁrst’ game of the
tournament. -.

I . Members of the senior class also .
succeeded in breaking individual’ 

kgcox-u-annual.-—---11-.-:-—..

school records throughout the regu-~
lar season. ‘ A
Amistade, an outﬁelder, holds

the ‘Pitt record for‘ career stolen I

bases and swiped a team-leading
27 bags this season in her 31 at-
tempts.’ ' ’
Tutt, a utility ﬁelder, found a
great deal of success at the plate
in her Pitt career, holding both the

, career and single-season records

at Pitt for runs scored and walks as
well as the single-season record for
triples with six. 3 _
For Tutt, breaking records and
individual achievementsiare just
things that.happen‘ when working

. toward a greater goal.

“I do n’t pay attention to records

-and statistics,” Tutt said. ‘.‘One of

"our main focuses this year was
to improve -our hitting, .and that
is What I try to do each time I am

at the plate. The more things you I '

think about when you are hitting,
the harder it is to focus.” _ -
While Tutt dominated at_th
plate, Berliner and O’Connellfound
success from the pitching mound.
Berlinér’s 48 wins are the most
in school history, and O’Connell
recorded a Pitt season-high 15 vic-
tories this season. ‘
Berliner said that the signiﬁ-

, cance of team goals always outweigh
‘ personal recognition, especially

given the tight team connection
felt by the Panthers.

“We [the seniors] have had four
years of hard work and that is not
easy,” Berliner said. “You can’t
let yourself get caught up in per-
sonal numbers, because everyone
needs to work together toward one
'goal.” . . . ‘ _

For the seniorsand the entire
Pitt team, the records that mean
the most are those that apply to
the whole team and its overall win
total.

I Tutt said the number of wins for
the Panthers this season reveals
how they’ve improved as a team
throughout the season.

Aprile expounded upon that sen-
timent, crediting the entire team
for the success of theseason thus
far.“All the records we have broken
are a tribute to all the hardywork and

terriﬁc things this team has‘done,”. Q

Aprile said-. “The good results have

come from hard work  staying _

focused.” I . i

Pitt enters important
series, with West Virginia 

Donnie Tasser
Staff Writer

Pitt’s home against confer-
ence rival West Virginia this
weekend will play a vital role in
deciding the end of the season
for both teams.

Pitt and WVU are battling
for position in the Big East con-
ference standings. West Vir-
ginia is currently third in the

conference with a 13-8 Big East
record. Pitt follows at 12-9.
Connecticut leads the Big

East at 18-3. St. John’s sits in s

second place with a413-71_con-
ference record. 
“It’s a huge series,” junior

j—-111:-ndh

starting pitcher Matt Iannazzo
said. “We need to improve upon
every aspect of our game if we

want to win.” , - . ,
‘ Iannazzo will start Friday’s

contest against the 27-19 West
Virginia Mountaineers.
One of the Panthers’ great-

est strengths heading into the '
_three—game series with West

Virginia is theiroffense. Pitt
(28-18-) ,currently.has nine
players who are batting more
than .300 this season and leads
the 12-team conference with a
.312 batting average.

Pitt head coachjoejordano
credited assistant coach Danny
Lopazue and volunteer coach
Kyle Cheesebrough with the

offensive success.

“When we ‘execute our game
plan we are asgood as anyone,;’,
Jordana said in an e-mail.
“However, we have drifted at
times from our approach and
have struggled. At this stage of
the season, we need to execute
all phases of the game.” I

Theseries looks like it wiﬂ

I be an offensive battle, as the

Mountaineers are third in the
conference with a .304 team
batting average. Both teams
sit near the top in the Big East

Panthers struggle in recent conference games

Easebalk 11

last in the Big East in team ERA
at 4.92. Pitt is sixth at 4.08.
The Mountaineers have given
up 252 runs this season, tenth
tin the Big East, while Pitt has
allowed 217 — tied for sixth.

Despite sitting near the top
of the.Big East, the Panthers
have recently hit a small in-
conference s-lump.

Over the past few weeks,

they lost two ofthree to Cincin-
nati and were swept in a three-
game series by St.John’s. Those
losses were sandwiched around
nonconference routs ofAkron
and Cleveland State.
-"9 “It has been a tough couple
of weeks in conference — we
have lost three of five games
by a run and the other by two
runs,”]ordano said. “But in this
conference, that is the name
of the game. We have played
pretty consistently throughout
the year and we playedwell this
weekend —- wejust came up on
the short end.”

Pitt lost by scores of 9-7 and
9-8 to Cincinnati and ﬁnal tal-

Ties of2-1 and 8-7 in 10 innings

to St. John’s.

The Panthers defeated'Cin-

cinnati in the opening game of
the series 9-8 using a Kevan
Smith three-run homer in the
eighth inning to come back
from a two-run deficit. Smith
—— who was named Big East
Player of the Week on April 11
—— also had an RBI single in the
first inning.
B‘ “It’s a great honor. There are
a lot ofgreat players in the con-
ference,”-Smith said. “It kind of
caught me by surprise and I was
honored, but I couldn’t have
done it without the team.”

In the 2-1 loss to St. John’s,
Iannazzo threw a complete
game two—hitter, but registered
the loss because the Panthers
gave up an unearned run in the
seventh inning, just a half-in-
ning after third baseman Phil
Konieczny’s RBI single gave
Pitt the lead.

“I was mixing pitches really
well and throwing strikes,” Ian-
nazzo said. “I didn’t have any
walks and I was keeping them
off balance by consistently
Qhrowing strikes.”

Iannazzo now has three of
the team’s four complete games
this season. *-

“I want to finish what I

start,” Iannazzo said. “I real-

_ ly want to go deep into games

because that means I’m giving
my team a good chance ofwin-
ning — it means I’m pitching
really well and giving my team
the best chance to win.”
Smith said that as the team
moves on to face West Virginia,
it’s important for the Panthers

to put the series against St. _

John’s behind them.

“‘It was a rough one, but
WVU is our biggest rival and
it’s a huge conference series,”
Smith said. “We need to just
come out firing on all cylin-
ders, don’t take them lightly
and focus on the little things.
We need to treat every game

.like the Big East Champion-

ship.’-’ .

Following the series with
WVU, the team will play a non-
conference game at Youngstown
State before traveling to South
Florida for the final series of
the season from May 19-21.

, The champions of each con-
ference are awarded automatic‘
bids, while the remainder of
the 64-team field is selected
by a committee. Not wanting
to leave anything to chance,
Jordano knows how his team
must finish the season.

“We need to win the confer-
ence. Period.” [

Pirates could provide quality

summer entertainment  

Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer

What are Pittsburgh sports fans sup-
posed to watch now?

The Pitt football season’s high
hopes for the 2010 season were
quickly shot down with a 27-24 loss to
the Utah Utes in the season opener.

Four more losses, a co—Big East
Championship, three early exits by
underclassmen, awacky bowl game,
three head coaches and a revamped
recruiting class later, and the Pan-
thers began preparing for the “high
octane” 2011 season.

The Steelers lostaheartbreaking
Super Bowl to Green Bay, leaving a
bitter taste in Pittsburgh sports fans’
mouths for the off-season, and with
the NFL lockout, who knows how long
thatofl’-season will be? e

The No. 1-seeded Pitt basketball_

teamwas upset during March Mad-

ness in afoul-ﬁlledﬁnal minute by the
eventual national runner-up, Butler.
The Pittsburgh Penguins and their
no—headed monster—— caused by Ev-
geni Malkin sitting out with an ACL
and MCL injury and Sidney Crosby sit-
.ting out with the most-discussed con-
cussion in hockey history — ﬂamed
out in the ﬁrst round of the playoffs
to the Tampa Bay Lightning.
After the Penguins failed to ﬁnish

the  off even after their 3-1 4

series lead, Pittsburgh’s sports fans
began their disappointed summer
vacation.

Summer usually belongs to base-
ball, but in Pittsburgh, that usually
doesn’t mean much. The Pirates are
just that lifeless team in the North
Shore that keeps fans mildly in-

terested until the next season rolls’

around. _
However, people in Pittsburgh

have been talking about the Pirates

— and the chatter isn’t about which

promotion is coming up next. While
the Pirates aren’t likely to match the
success of the Steelers, Panthers or
Penguins, Pitt students might have
a sport to watch and care about this
summer, instead of a sport to watch
only forthe promise of ﬁreworks fol-
lowing the ﬁnal out.

The Pirates -— so often the butt
of jokes -— have found a spark under
new manager Clint Hurdle.

Hurdle has taught this team that
anything is possible. Lyle Overbay can
bunt, Pedro Alvarez can steal, Charlie
Morton can pitch and the Pirates can
ﬁnish the season at .500. For most
teams, ﬁnishing .500 would likely
make the season afailure. But forthe
Pirates, it’s a start and a startis allfans
can really ask for,

The Pirates are in the midst of 18
straight losing seasons so the miracle

reach an 18-17 record andmany fans are hoping
that this year, the success isn’t ﬂeeting.

Right now, the Pirates are third in the Na— ‘

tional League Central, two games behind the
St. Louis Cardinals (20-15) and one game be-
hind the Cincinnati’Reds (19-16). It may not
seem like much, but it’s not last place, and that’s
something.

Led by a budding superstar in Andrew Mc-
Cutchen, the Pirates are exciting, young and,

5 most importantly, talented.

The pitching staff is one of the main reasons
for the Pirates’ recent impressive play. This is a
strong comrastfrom the pastfew seasons, when
the Bucs’ hurlers were considered the main
reason for the Pirates’ dismal record.

In 2010, three Pirates’ starting pitch-
ers reached three wins on Aug. 31 when Jeff
Karstens picked up—histhirdviétoiy ofthis sea-

he doesn’t own, has never read and is not even
sure that such aniristructional manual was ever
written. ,

So Pittsburgh, we now have three profes-
sional sports teams. V

The Pirates’ early play has earnedthe respect
of opposingplayers, “Baseball Tonight” analysts
and the ever—negative pundits in the Pittsburgh
media. What happens the rest of the season
remains to be seen, as a complete collapse of
the early season success is certaintly not outside
the realm of possibili , but for right now, the
Pirates are the talk of the town. A

The 2011 Buccos are the Battling Buccos
once again, and they deserve their almost—daﬂy
three—hour spot’ on Root Sports.

If you haven’t timed in yet, do. These are
ﬁnally your parents’ Pittsburgh Pirates — for
now. 1

. ESSARY,

Thinking of Quitting
Smoking? The Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh seeks
smokers aged 18-65
who are already plan-
ning to quit smoking to
participate in a 9-week
research study on the
short~term effects of
two oral medications
on smoking behavior,
craving, and mood.
One is FDA-approved
for smoking cessation,
Zyban (bupropion),
and the other is FDA-
approved for wakeful-
ness, Provigil
(modaﬁnil). This is
not a treatment study.
You will be asked to

take study medication

that may or may not
contain the active com-
ponents. Research
study participants will
be compensated. Al-
though this study is not
a treatment trial, every-
one who completes the
study will be offered
optional brief counsel-
ing and Zyban (bupro—
pion) at no cost after
the study is over to
help them quit penna-
nently. For more infor-

mation,’ visit our web- 5
