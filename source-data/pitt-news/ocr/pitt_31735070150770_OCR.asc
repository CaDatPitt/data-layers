Students
prepare for
marathon

Em Maier
Staff lVrz'ter

In a few months, thousands "of
people will tighten their laces, clip
a piece of paper to their shirts and
hope they don’t collapse during
the annual Pittsburgh Marathon.

Megan Lee is one of them. This
is her second time running the
marathon.

“When I ran the Pittsburgh one
last year, I became obsessed,” Lee
said.

Lee, an exercise science major
in her senior year at Pitt, joined
forces withjohn Schneider, of Pitt’s
Intramurals and Recreation Of-
ﬁce, to create a program for Pitt
students, faculty and staff to train
and run the upcoming marathon
together.

“We ﬁgured if we brought stu-
dents together, it would be cool
to get involved. There were a ton
of students and staff already run-
ning — we wanted a training pro-
gram for them and others,” Lee
explained.

Pittsburgh Campus Challenge,
in its inaugural year, has estab-
lished a big goal for itself: It prom-
ises to have group runs, incentives,
running coaches and seminars.

The program will also give a
$35 student discount for the mara-
thon’s registration cost, lowering
the price to $65 for a ha1f—mara—
thon or $75 for a full marathon.

Dick’s Sporting Goods, which
sponsors the full marathon, has yet
to unveil a route for this year’s race.

Nordenberg addresses potential appropriation cuts

Cassidy Davis
Stcyjf W7z'ter

Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
took the opportunity at his annual
address yesterday to speak to stu-
dents about the history of state
budget cuts to Pitt and prepare the
student body to advocate against
the potential of more cuts this year.

“We’ve got to keep up a sus-
tained advocacy effort, starting
now,” Nordenberg told the room of
about 30 attendees at Alumni Hall.

Noting that Pennsylvania’s four
state-related universities —— Pitt,
Temple University, Lincoln Uni-
versity and Penn State University
— were “designed to bring greater
numbers of affordable, high-quali-

ty higher—education opportunities
within the reach of students” upon
their creation in 1965, Nordenberg
said that when state—related uni-
versity status was created, there
was a widely shared View that in-
vesting in higher education was the
right thing to do morally and was
also the most sensible investment
for a strong collective future.

But, according to Norden-
berg, the ﬁnancial situation has
changed.

“Even before the recession hit,
here in Pennsylvania support for
higher education was ﬂat — stag-
nant for the period of a decade,”
the chancellor said.

But No rdenberg noted that
even the steady funding changed

 

Tues nay. F£BRUARCr’ 12. 2013

in 2010 when Pennsylvania Gov.
Tom Corbett proposed a 50 per-
cent reduction in Pitt’s general ap-
propriation and that funding for
the University’s academic medical
center be eliminated.

After advocacy efforts made
by the Pitt community that year,
the general appropriation cuts
were reduced to 19 percent and
health center funding was cut by
50 percent.

In the years that followed, Pitt
faced a series of further cuts. Most
recently, the University found
itself facing a new proposed 30
percent general appropriations
cut last February, which was even-
tually eliminated in favor of ﬂat
funding.

Nordenberg said that when
faced with last year’s proposed
cuts, Pitt’s undergraduate Student
Government Board and Graduate
and Professional Student Assem-
bly ensured that elected ofﬁcials
heard student opinions through
a campaign that included letters,
phone calls, emails and social me-
dia advocacy.

Last year, Pitt also organized its
largest delegation of students ever
to travel to Pitt Day in Harrisburg,
a day when students have the op-
portunity to meet face to face with
elected representatives in the state
capital to make the case for higher-
education funding.

Nordenberg said that students were
joined in this advocacy by alumni, faculty,
friends, staff and trustees who expressed
their particular interest in Pitt and gen-
eral support for the cause for higher public
education.

“Every dollar from that proposed cut in
February was restored because legislators
heard what they had to say,” he said.

Nordenberg added that anyone can cut
costs, but that cutting costs while preserving
quality is the real trick.

Nordenberg said that he is waiting to
learn what level of funding Corbett will
propose for Pitt this coming year on Feb.
5, the day the governor releases his budget
recommendations.

The chancellorfalso pffered tips to stué

dents on how to speak‘-to; elected oﬁicials.-*

of an effective way to portray your mes-

thoroughly enjoyed what Nordenberg had
to say.

“I thought it was really honest. It gave us
some insight in what we should do for Pitt
Day in Harrisburg [and] the steps we can
take as students to ensure that budget cuts
don’t go further,” Patel said.

jenny Verbiar, a junior athletic training
major, agreed that Nordenberg was helpful
in giving students advice in talking to elected
officials, especially if this was something
new for students.

“It’s amazing that they wanted to cut
that much, and that through Pitt Day in
Harrisburg and his efforts with legislature,
they’ve been able to save that much for us,”
Verbiar said.

Pitt Day in Harrisburg is Feb. 12 and reg-
istration for it is currently taking place on
the Student Government Board’s website.

Nordenberg concluded his speech by
relating the issue of budget cuts to the 225th

anniversary celebration that Pitt is holding
this year. , "V ,_

“The theme for our 225 celebration was
225 years of building better lives, and it isn’t
just a slogan. This is an institution of choice
for talented, idea—f'orming,. hardworking
students. This is a place that is particularly
well—equipped to nurture the abilities and
advance the dreams of those students,” he
said. I

the race began at the corner of 26th Street
and Penn Avenue Downtown before winding
through other Pittsburgh neighborhoods
including Oakland, Shadyside and the South
Side. It ended Downtown on Liberty Avenue
at 11th Street.

Steel City Road Runners Club, a Pitts-
burgh-based running club that offers semi-
nars and group runs, has joined Pitt's efforts
to encourage students to run the marathon.
The club is offering Pittsburgh Campus
Challenge participants a free 6-month
basic membership. After the race, all the
program's participants will be invited to a
party that offers a candy buffet and private
massages. "

The program, which is free, is available
for students to register up untiljan. 30. Al-

ready in its third week, it will continue until
the day of the race, on May 5.

Lee said all students are invited to par-
ticipate, from experienced runners to couch
potatoes. "

Those new to the world of marathon-
ing are trained on the basis of the Couch-
to—5K program, a nine—week program that
progressively prepares novice runners for
lengthy races. Inexperienced runners are
also encouraged to do a relay race, which are

usually shorter distances than a marathon. P

Marathon veterans are recruited to
be team leaders. Leaders initiate weekly
group runs and seminars, motivating and
encouraging their team to continue with
the program.

Sarah Grabowski, an intern in the in-
tramural ofﬁce recruited to help with the
program by advertising it through ﬂyering,
Facebook and Twitter, emphasized the im-
portance of group leaders to the Pittsburgh

Integration into campus life is key
  for commuter students’ success

Jonathan Fischer
Columnist

‘- Let’s talk about the loneliness that

comes from commuting to college.

Let’s talk about the days we are
dropped off by bus and asked to
simply integrate with the ﬂow of
students who do not bear the bur-
den of living off campus. As a com-
muter, I don’t have to deal with
thehousing fees of on-campus
students, but this luxury comes
at a cost.

I attended Pitt and completed
my undergraduate degree with
the hope of future professional
possibilities. I was (and still am)
classiﬁed as a commuter student,
although now I work full time and
am a graduate student. My ulti-
mate goal was to attain my de-
gree and become more useful to
society. So far, I think I’ve been
successful in my endeavor.

The commuter student popu-
lation is a diverse group encom-
passing full—time students living
with their parents, part-time
students who live in off—campus

apartments, parents with children
at home and full—time workers.
Typically, the commuter student
walks, rides a bike, takes public
transportation or drives to cam-
pus to attend classes. Rarely do -we

spend additional time outside of
the classroom on campus. Have
you ever taken a Port Author-
ity bus at night? We’re a hearty
bunch, but the commute is tiring

enough in the daytime.

But as I think back a couple
years to the chilled evenings when
I was considered a full-time stu-
dent, I remember passing bulletin
boards of events that took place
during the evening hours, later
than what my bus schedule would
allow me to attend. I had realized
that life as a commuter was rough,
particularly when looking for
‘someone to date.

One goal that many of us have
is to start seriously dating in col-
lege -— some of us even would like
to ﬁnd a suitable partner to spend
the rest of our lives with. However,
if you happen to be a commuter
student, your options suddenly
become far more limited. How
could I think about love when I
had to make my 5 p.m. bus every
day?

Might I make a suggestion?
How about a commuter student
speed-dating event? We already
have a 25-by-25 foot commut-
ers’ lounge, complete with a few

outlets. We could advertise it in the cal-
endar of the Commuter Student Associa-
tion’s website, which hasn’t been updated
in almost six months. Maybe that will get
the ball rolling.

A great amount of socialization for Pitt
students occurs in cafeterias, shops around
Forbes Avenue, the William Pitt'Union, ac-
tivity and club meetings, recreation centers
and during late-night study sessions. In
a 1993 study by Alexander Astin, it was
shown that this peer—group interaction
positively affects critical thinking skills,

cultural awareness and both leadership

and academic development.

As a result of not living in residence
halls or spending a signiﬁcant amount of
time on campus, commuter students often
miss out on opportunities to “connect” to
the University and other students.

I know that there have been attempts
to make us feel integrated, and I appreci-
ate that. There are evening activities every
Wednesday hosted by the Commuter Stu-
dent Association on campus along with
other events for ﬁrst-year commuters. I
also recall attending several of the twice-
monthly “Soup and Substance” sessions,

which included a department guest speaker, .

and well, soup. The attempts to integrate
us were made, and they were appreciated.

Commuters swiftly travel through the
climate changes of Pittsburgh with sturdy

boots and heavy backpacks. While we don’t
receive the luxury of roaming the campus
in pajama pants when we please, we can
make the most of our time as commuters
at Pitt. And there are other options for ac-
tivities available to us, despite our difficult
schedules.

Commuter students have options to
make connections, even if it might be more
difficult for them than for peers who live on

_ campus. The Commuter Student Lounge is

actually a suitable “home away from home.”
I remember sharing countless hours there
laughing at “fail” videos between classes.
It truly was a centralized meeting spot.

The amount of commuter programs and
services is limited, but so is our time. We
don’t require the same number of activi-
ties that an on—campus student requires. I
deﬁnitely appreciated activities that helped
me connect with other students, includ-
ing Wednesday movie nights and the guest
speaker series. ‘

I transferred froma respectable com-'
munity college. When_I applied to Pitt, I
knew that I would be a commuter. I knew
that the “college experience” of living on
campus was something that I could not
attain for ﬁnancial reasons.

By the end of my undergraduate degree,

I looked back and realized that I’d met a lot _

of awesome people and had a lot of good

times. We, as commuters,;might have dif- .

ferent challenges, but we are never alone
in facing them.

I spent much of last week discussing the

that not just ‘super-slates’ chose to par-

“scandal,” complete with supposed conspir-

John Hasley’sJan. 25 column, “Questioning
the future of the slate system in Pitt’s SGB

me to further think about the truce’s effects.
I proposed this agreement because I didn’t

depicted by TPN, but it doesn’t come close
to the appalling portrayal of Annie. I didn’t
agree with some of her decisions during

to say Annie did not work to prevent what

Cold weather promotes layering options, clothing variation

Anna Weldon
Impulse Editor

With winter weather ﬁnally setting in, the
15-minute walking commute to class seems
more like a desperate trek through the
mountains. Snow has covered Pittsburgh’s
sidewalks and turned into slush — a harm-

ful weather element for fashionable boots -

and shoes.

But snow, rain and ice won’t com-
pletely wreck your style. Drastic climate
changes allow for smart fashion choices.
The cold weather opens up a variety of
ensemble possibilities, and although the
constant snow might dampen your spirits,
it shouldn’t ruin your style.

The most important winter staples are
boots and jackets. Without these two ar-
ticles of clothing, a warm outﬁt can easily
turn into a sloppy, wet mess, so it’s impor-
tant to have solid fundamentals in your
closet.

Start at the bottom. With slushy side-
walks, Pittsburgh is not the place to strut a
pair of heels in the winter. Consider more
practical shoes such as snow boots, and
make sure to purchase them waterproofed
orbuy a waterprooﬁng supplement to keep
your feet protected.

Although these shoes might not be the
Amost fashion forward, you can easily add
a stylish pair of socks or leg warmers to give
clunky boots more feminine features. With

patterns, these simple articles of clothing
not only help to keep you warm during the
winter months, but also add a fashionable
component to your ensemble.

The easiest way to stay warm and look
good at the same time is to add multiple
layers to your outﬁt. Start with a simple
piece and build of it. A long—sleeve black
shirt looks great with almost anything,

including bulky sweaters —- the warm-
est layer -—-— and colorful scarves. Inﬁnity

with most colors of scarves and sweaters.

For adventurous days and nights, incor-
porate something with leopard print to add
more spark to the ensemble. This will sepa-
ratelyou from the dreadful grays and blacks
that everyone tends to wear, replicating the
drabness of the winter weather. Be sure not
to over-incorporate bright patterns into
your wardrobe. With too much diversity,
an outﬁt won’t seem cohesive, so it’s best
to choose one central piece — be it a zoo-
themed shirt or a funky scarf — to liven
up a look without it becoming overbearing.

One of the most essential additions
to your wardrobe is a thick coat or jacket
that will help to keep cold Winds at bay.
Long puffer coats are sometimes the best
decision, despite their sleeping—bag—like
quality, because they cover the major-
ity of your body with a sufficient layer of
warmth. Other good coats, such as pea
coats, might seem less casual but will still
offer adequate warmth. Either Way, the
best method of keeping yourself warm
while ﬁghting ice-cold wind chills is to
add layers beneath your coat, such as extra
sweaters and vests. This will keep your
trunk warm, so you’re comfortable on your

- walk to and from class.

scarves create a cozy appeal, while more ‘

standard patterned scarves add a multi-
dimensional look to your outﬁt.

Stick to simple patterns.-Winter is not
the time to break out overly decorative
ﬂoral patterns. Keep to stripes or small
polka dots to be safe. These patterns go well

The most important thing to consider
this winter is that your comfort is worth
more than your appearance. Choose practi-
cally instead of fashionably, but incorpo-
rate special pieces into your ensemble to
keep things Winsome. I

DERBY

a blocker who sets the pace of the jam ses-
sion and acts similar to a goalie on the rink.
The pivot wears a striped helmet cover and
serves as the last line of defense against the
opposing jammer.

“It’s a race between two people with
eight obstacles. Worse, [the obstacles] form
walls,” Wendekier said, referring to the way
in which blockers often team up to prevent
a jammer from moving down a lane.

The start of a jam session looks like two
football lines plowing into each other — only
the women aren’t wearing full-body pads,
and they maneuver on skates. The jammer
from each team works around her obstacles
violently, sometimes falling into the referee’s
lane or into a mob of derby girls.

In the ﬁrst bout of Sunday’s Battle of the
’Burgh, Shockratease, number 511 on the Al-
legheny Avengers, notched a 40-point jam
session. At the start of thejam session, there
were three major penalties called, forcing
the jammer from the Penn Bruisers and two
blockers into the penalty box.

Shockratease broke through the remain-
ing blockers victoriously and took advantage

of the power jam — when only one jammer
is on the rink and the other is in the penalty
box. She was able to ﬂy around the rink,
periodically plowing into the other team’s
blockers.

Skaters can perform a series of small pen-

variety of techniques to help her.

To further her skating, her team set up a ‘

sling shot, propelling her forward — clear-
ly a play that the Allegheny Avengers have
practiced before. By the end of the power
jam, Shockratease had scored 40 points.
She made seem‘-

pushes and shoves.

group of blockers, which waited patiently on
the rink to hit her like a brick wall and stop
her from scoring her points. But because
of the decreased defense and missing Penn
Bruiser jammer, her team maneuvered a

tempt to push away

her opponents.
“You might be seeing a legendary mo-
ment in Pittsburgh sports history,” the an-
nouncer gawked. The Allegheny Avengers,
who followed the Penn Bruisers for much
of the game, emerged victorious at the end
of the match. The number of points Shock-

\

rare occurrence in roller derby. The ﬁnal
score of the bout was Allegheny Avengers
141, Penn Bruisers 73. ’ -

The teams began a lap around the rink
as fans hustled to touch the sweaty palms of
their family members, friends and cowork-
ers on the track.

“I’m a ﬁghter.”

It’s not hard to spot the derby girls among
the crowd. They usually wear their competi-
tion clothes to the rink, and they have their
hair (sometimes spiked or full of glitter) and
makeup (bright colors and more glitter)
ready. Each is a combination of a pinup, an
athlete and a punk rocker. .

In the crowd, men and women of all ages
ﬁll the roller rink. A little girl wears a T-
shirt that says “Future Derby Girl,” and a
man and a woman wearing T-shirts that say
“Doc Sk8” and “Mrs. Sk8,” respectively, are
sitting beside an elderly woman who looks
at least 85. Fans of the skater called LorAxe

rink, and wear pads and mouth guards to
lessen the impact of their falls.

Derby games can become very intense
at times, and the pushing and shoving can
lead to some scary injuries. _

Skaters wipe out, rolling on the track
sideways, while opposing blockers swiftly
hop over them to continue the j am. There’s
always action on the rink — save.for the
stagnant and strategic blocks to stop the
jammers —- that keeps the skaters in con-
stant circular motion on the track. They
rotate their agile bodies forcefully and delib-
erately, manipulating the only tool available
to them on the rink. »

Steve Tackett, who goes by Stone Cold
Steve Awesome when he’s refereeing games,
has seen his fair share of dislocated bones
and bloodshed.

One night, while refereeing, he watched
a girl hit the track. When she didn’t get back
up like the skaters usually do, he noticed that
she had landed on her elbow awkwardly and
that her bone was protruding.

These injuries don’t seem to upset skat-
ers, however, and women continue to take
part in the sport. Jamie Mulvihill skated as
a jammer before she began coaching and
found the sport representative of her per-
sonality.

“Being the jammer is two—fold. Your name
is in the limelight more than anyone else on
the team. You’re the quarterback,” she said.
“You’re also going to get beat on more than
anyone else on the floor.”

For Mulvihill, her personality changes as
soon as she puts onskates. Outside of the
rink, she is a mother and a career woman,
but when she skates, she’sJ-Bomb.

“I’m a ﬁghter,” she said. “I’m aggressive.”

 

Skates and whiskey and bears — oh my!

The Steel City Roller Derby is relatively
new. It got its start in 2006 when a group
of women took to the rink, shaking up the
family-friendly environment when they
started crashing into one another. But the
full history of roller derby extends further
into the past.

It may or may not come as a shock that
the idea for a women—only roller derby

January 29, 2013 i The Pitt News I wwx/v.piiinevvs.com

came from a men’s sports promoter. Leo
Seltzer gathered a group of men and women,
slapped skates on them and hit the road
as the 1935 Transcontinental Roller Derby.
The idea, born during the Great Depression,
gave young people the chance to travel and
see the country while also providing others
with some entertainment.

But it wasn’t until the new millennium

, that a revival occurred that would propel the
‘sport to the popularity that it has garnered

today. In 2001, Daniel Eduardo Policarpo,
acdrifter musician’ known by his friends
as Devil Dan, started recruiting women in
downtown Austin, Texas, to bring his wild
vision of roller derby to fruition.

Downing bottles of Jack Daniel’s while
organizing his vision for the sport, he de-
scribed roller derby in “Hell on Wheels,” a
2007 documentary, as “a crazy circus with
these clowns unfortunately stabbing each
other, these bears onﬁre on these unicycles.”
Well, the stabbing and bears didn’t really
become_a part of roller derby as weknow it.

Policarpo, now 40, ended up skipping
town, leaving his wild idea to a group of

wild women..Several women, who called ,
themselves the Sh"e—E—Os‘,condu'c'ted the ‘

ﬁrst inaugural bout onjune 23, 2002. Play-
ing the role of incorrigibile rebels, some of
them tattooed, the disaffected young women

J presented the sport as a symbol of the third-

wave feminist sisterhood.

They were tough, but also sexy, combin-
ing leather and lace into ensembles that
they wore as they pushed into one another,
showing no remorse for the possibility that
knocking someone to the ground could re-
sult in injury. There were pretend ﬁghts and
a place called Spank Alley, a penalty box
in which fans were encouraged to slap the
skaters’ behinds.

Now, about 400 derby teams exist across
the country, and it’s remained awomen-only
sport, save for the men who play a role in
coaching, volunteering and refereeing. A
new skater-owned organization, the Wom-
en’s Flat Track Derby Association, emerged
in 20021 and goes by the motto of “By the
skaters, for the skaters.”

As the new leagues formed, the sexed-up
theatrics started to ﬁzzle. The fake ﬁghting
and spanking fromthe audience became
discouraged. _Even at the Steel City Derby,
miniskirts are not permitted unless there

are spandex shorts or tights underneath.
Roller derby is really the only women’s

‘sport that makes a point of its femininity

without it serving as an exploit for men. The
skaters choose to participate in this sport
for their beneﬁt, and from the reactions of
the roaring crowd, it’s clear that their loved
ones enjoy the gratiﬁcation they obtain.

Mulvihill feels that roller derby helps
portray strong, independent women.

“It shows people that we are not just a
typical woman that they think we are,” she
said. If

Likewise, Stielson views the sport as a
place that allows for all women to partici-
pate, regardless of their appearance.

“I think it’s very empowering [for wom-
en]. It promotes very strong, conﬁdent wom-
en, women of all body types,” Stielson said.
She explained that while a thinner woman
may be a better jammer, a tall woman or
someone with curves acts as an ideal blocker.
The entire sport works to break the restric-
tive molds in order to accept all women.

The skaters can wear feminine clothes
but still violently hit their opponents, giv-
ing the sport multiple dimensions. In roller
derby, there are various traits of femininity
that the women embrace. Skaters can be
tough and still be sexy. They can wear edgy
makeup or playful masks. Off the court, they

may be successful career women and moth-
ers; on the court, they are vivacious athletes.
And the roller derby girls will ﬁght you for
that right.

“We’re out for blood,” Mulvihill said. I

Free throw woesplague Panthers in loss

Jasper Wilson
/1ssz'sta72t Sports Editor

' “Unable to overcome abysmal free-throw shoot-
ing, the Pitt men’s basketball team fell to No. 12
Louisville Monday night in Kentucky.

The 64-61 defeat at the KFC Yum! Center
snapped a four-game winning streak for the
Panthers, who trailed for a little over 35 min-
utes of the 40-minute game but never by more
than 12 points. Pitt got within as few as three
points of their opponents’ score multiple times
as the game wound down, first after back—to-
back threes by redshirt senior Tray Woodall and
freshmanjames Robinson with six minutes to

, go in the second half and then againby redshirt
/juunior Lamar Patterson with 1:18 remaining.

Pitt (17-5, 5-4 Big East) shotjust 3—for-12 (25
percent) from the free-throw line, well below its
season average of 67.2 percent, but that almost
didn’t matter.

Yet another triple by Woodall, this one well
beyond the arc, with 13.3 seconds left gave Pitt
a lifeline. But the Cardinals (17-4 overall, 5-3
Big East) took it away by converting four free
throws, which made the last—second 3—pointer
from Woodall, who ﬁnished with a team-high
14 points, little more than a consolaﬁon prize.

Patterson was the only other Panther to
ﬁnish in doubledigits, recording a total of 10
points.

Louisville played without sophomore starter
Wayne Blackshear for the game after he sprained
his right shoulder during practice on Sunday.
Blackshear has averaged 22 minutes and 9.2
points per game —- fourth—best on the team
— this season.

The trio of junior Russ Smith, junior Gorgui
Dieng and sophomore Chane Behanan carried
the hosts in his absence, scoring 20, 14 and 12
points, respectively.

- v, Redshirt freshman Durandjohnson played
a mere two minutes in the contest for Pitt after
seeing 13.9 minutes on average in the rest of Big
East play so far this season.

The team next plays on Saturday at noon

Coming into the Pitt wrestling team’s

match against Lock Haven, No. 6 heavy-

weight Zac Thomusseit led the team in
mpins this season with eight.

It didn’t take him long to pick up his
ninth pin on Saturday. Only 2:32 into
the match, Thomusseit ﬂattened Cody
Mason’s shoulders to earn a fall along

 

 

Pitt thoroughly  

with six team points for the Panthers.

“I didn’t envision leading the team in
pins,” he said. “It’s something that has
really just happened, and now I’m trying
to get a couple more as the remaining part
of the season comes.”

With six wrestlers earning bonus
points, including Thomusseit with his
six-point pin, the No. 17 Pitt wrestling
team ended its two-match losing streak in
a big way, on the back of a 32-4 takedown

advantage, cruising through Eastern
Wrestling League foe Lock Haven 33-6.

The wrestlers credited their coaches
for getting them back on track.

“It was an important win for the team,”
Shelton Mack said. “I feel like the coaches
have prepared us well to start peaking and
ﬁnish out the rest of the season strong.”

GRAIN OF SAUL

Football
losing its Way
in midst of
identity crisis
sen.-§:a§Zy§Sva‘i;r.~zer

Politics and sports have officially collided,
and football is drowning because of it.

There is no way around it anymore: My
least favorite institution has found its way
into my favorite institution, and now I must
suffer.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for a good
political discussion, a heated debate on gun
control or religion in school. But in modern
America, the political realm seems to stand
more on money and corruption than it does
on merit and people. "

Now I know what you’re thinking — what,
sports isn’t about money? Referees are never
corrupt? I’d never make such a claim, at least
not these days. -

But just consider President Barack Obama
dipping his toes into the sports world when
he made his comments last week about fear-
ing for his child’s safety if he were to play
football. ‘

My immediate reaction was sour. What
does it say when our president takes a stand
against something like football‘? How did
we go from heroism to player safety on our
holy gridiron?

While I believe in the sincerity of Obama’s
comments and his concern about the safety
aspect of football, I believe he (and we) have
lost sight of all the incredible things football
has done for our country and more impor-
tantly, our people.

No more are the days when we think of
football and talk about how many children’s
lives it has saved.

No more are the days when we think of
football and talk about how many kids from
inner-city schools could have spent the hours
between dismissal and their mom coming
home on drugs after engaging in gang-related
activities.

No more are the days when we think of
football and then think of the success sto-
ries of athletes who came from nothing and
earned college degrees to ultimately con-
tribute to our nation’s economy. This is a
contribution that would have been impos-
sible without an outlet for their natural gifts.

No more are the days when we think of
football and talk about that feeling of stand-_
ing shoulder to shoulder with your brothers,

Saul D 9

your classmates and your family all while,

your peers do battle on the ﬁeld in front
ofyou. ,

No more are the days when we think
of football and consider all the people it’s
brought together.

No more are the days when we think of‘

football and consider the children who have
been inspired by their favorite athletes per-
severing through injuries or losing records
or regular old hardships. _

Once, there was a time when we thought
of Brett Favre and what came to mind was
his 399—yard, four—touchdowr_1 game the
day after his father died. Now we think of
multiple retirements, money, concussions,
betrayal and sexual misconduct.

Once, there was a time when Michael
Vick made us believe that no matter your
size or speed, you could play quarterback
in the NFL. Now, we think of dog ﬁghting
and late-career failure. A

Once, students who could earn their way
into college with athletics were gloriﬁed
and idolized. They had made it, they had
persevered. Now, we have to read articles
like the one in the New York Times about
astudy that found that public colleges and
universities that compete in Division I sports
spend three to six times as much money on

 

' each athlete than they do to educate non- '

athletic students.

So where did we go wrong? When did
football‘ become a sport that the face of
America wouldn’t want his son playing?

after dropping the 125-pound match.
Lock Haven’s No. 32 Bobby Rehm de-
feated Derrick Nelson, 11-5.

Down 3-0, No. 17 Mack needed a big
performance for the Panthers to get the
points back. Mack, who has struggled
early in matches all year, had three first-
period takedowns to jump out to a 6-2
advantage. V

“My main focus was to just try and
get more riding time during the first pe-
riod and go into the second with a bigger
lead,” Mack said.

In the end, the junior came through
with a big 12-4 major decision over Colton
Dalberth, putting the team up 4-3.

Lock Haven’s No. 24 Dan Neff quickly
grabbed the lead back for the Bald Eagles
with an 8-1 decision over No. 31 Travis
Shaffer at 141 pounds.

With the score at 6-4 in Lock Haven’s
favor, Pitt rattled off seven straight wins,
beginning at 149 pounds with No. 32 Ron-
nie Garbinsky’s 9-5 decision over Mac
Maldarelli. 1

No. 32 157—pound Donnie Tasser
turned in an excellent performance shut-
ting out his Bald Eagles opponent, Aaron
Fry, 12-0, for a major decision. Tasser
controlled the match by possessing over
ﬁve minutes of riding time.

For the majority of its meet on Saturday night, Pitt had league opponent Lock Haven
right where it wanted. Claire Deahl | Senior Staff Photographer

At 155 pounds, No. 13 Tyler Wilps
picked up a technical fall over Aaron
McKinney, 20-4.

Pitt’s No. 24 Nick Bonaccorsi also
earned bonus points for the team with
his major decision. Bonaccorsi defeated
Tyler Wood, 12-3.

One of the night’s best matches came
at 184 pounds between ranked wrestlers
No. 14 Max Thomusseit for the Panthers
and No. 29 Fred Garcia for the Bald Ea-
gles. In a tight match, Thomusseit pulled
through with a 4-1 decision. Thomusseit’s
victory clinched the team win, putting

_‘4'

the Panthers up 23-6 with two matches
remaining.

Pitt has excelled at the higher weight
classes all season.

“I think the heavier weights’ success
could be because of the upperclassmen
captains [Matt Wilps and Zac Thomus-
seit],” Max Thomusseit said. “The upper
weights train with these guys every day,
and they help push the others to do bet-
ter. Those captains are guys you can look
up to, but it is difficult when you are a
smaller weight and don’t wrestle thesee
guys every day.” .

The Panthers’ top wrestler, No. 2 Matt
Wilps, has seemingly found his stride.
He picked up a pin against a ranked op-
ponent at Oklahoma State and earned
Pitt a major decision victory, 15—5, over‘
Lock Haven’s Phil Sprenkle.

Heavyweight Zac Thomusseit’s victory
capped a big 33-6 win for the Panthers.
With several tough-and key matches re-
maining on the schedule, Pitt’s perfor-
mance Saturday gives the team forward
momentum. ‘

“It’s nice to get another win,” Zac Tho-
musseit said. “I think the win gives the
team some conﬁdence heading into some
key matches that are still remaining on
our schedule.”

The Panthers return to the Fitzgerald‘.
Field House this Saturday at 7 p.m. to
face traditional rival West Virginia. Next
Saturday’s match is the first of three at
home. I
