SCU Party Platform

We believe that the idea of representation
refers to ideas and feelings on relevant
issues affecting the University Community.
Organizations, and much less their presi-
dents, are in no way representative of such
views. In this sense, we feel that a legis-
lative body, elected according to the Student
Government Constitution and without any
legitimacy in the community, is
unacceptable. We believe that an individual
has the right to express his or her ideas and
feelings regardless of organizational
affiliation. Elections and the concept of
governance must be based on the following
principles: I. Since one of the major
sources of decision making lies in the
university senate, in accordance with
democratic principles, students should be
directly elected to membership on these
committees.

2. The removal of all legislative powers
from student government.

3. Inclusion of ‘a student affairs advisory
committee which is composed of presidents

We, the United Student Coalition, will —

1. Have open public hearings to discuss the
SG budget during the winter term before the
Allocations Committee submits any budget
to the Senate.

2. Appoint all Senators to some type of
University committee according to each
Senator's ability and experience in order to
fill these vacancies with responsible, rep-
resentative people, but allow committees
self-determination on complete membership
and voting procedure.

3. Establish an all-student Judiciary
Board to have jurisdiction over all students.

4. Increase the number of student
members on University and Faculty
committees. 5. Urge the University to:

a) support WPGH, our student radio
station, in its effort to obtain an FM radio
license so it can broadcast to all students;

b) work to establish a communications
department which would offer degrees in
written, sound, and visual media;

of major campus organizations and
coordinated by the student government
president in the constitution. This will serve
as a direct link with the administration.

4. An amending procedure which allows

any student with a petition of 300 signatures '

to secure a referendum automatically.

5. All students including part-time, and
full-time undergraduates and graduate stu-
dents are eligible to vote.

In addition, the Student Community Union
would like to institute a student—faculty
Court of Appeals to function as a
community-wide judicial body. This body
will have jurisdiction in all disciplinary
matters, social and academic. This would be
a major step toward securing both rights
and responsibilities for students in the
University Community.

CORRECTION »

In the past week, the Committee for Effective Student Gov-
ernment circulated a flyer endorsing the United Student Coalition
‘ party. The flyer contained the signatures of myself and Ralph
Cindrich as co-chairmen. As Ralph Cindrich was unable to be con-
tacted regarding the content of the flyer so that he might be able
to endorse it before our deadline, we went ahead with the letter
containing his signature—knowing that he had endorsed the USC
party. Due to our overzealousness inwanting to make SG effec-
tive and unite the student body, we made an error in judgment
due to our haste, and puhlically apologize to him. We now un-
derstand that he wishes ‘to remain neutral in this election and en-

dorses no party.

NICK GERVASE

START Party Platform

START is a collection of seniors
representing various areas of student
interest and bringing to this campaign the
highest degree of expertise on the problems
Student Government faces today. START is
not intending to tear down — we want to
build a new Student Government structure
which reflects the areas:

—— 1) in which students have gained an active
role in recent years.

—— 2) in which representatives to these
positions are fairly selected.

— 3) in which currently unrepresented areas
in academic and social interests are not
currently represented.

We plan to restructure SG in the following
way:

— 1. Win the election with the entire slate of
seniors.

- 2. Mandate a commission to hold open
hearings. do research. and write a new con-
stitution which will be presented to the
student body in a referendum.

—— 3. Resign from our SG positions and
insure that the commission carries out its
assigned task. All current committees will
continue to operate until a new constitution
is operating.

In addition to the ideas students present to
the commission, we have offered some
suggestions of our own that the commission
may consider. Following are our evalua-
tions, suggestions, and comments:

What are student government's current
strengths and weaknesses?

. .I. The Strengths

1. Students have a role in academic.
programming, and budgeting issues through
the Liberal Arts Cabinet, the social weekend
committees, the allocation committee. the
recognitions committee.

2. Students have gained a greater role in
University governance through seats on the
committees of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences and the University Senate. ,

3. Students still retain an identity
autonomous from that of the faculty

A administration by retaining the strugf eofe f ~

a Senate which can deal with issues of solely
student interest.

If. The Weaknesses

1. The faculty and administration often
consider the Student Affairs Advisory Com-
mittee — composed of the major interest
groups on campus (IFC. Pan-Hel. MDC. Pitt
News, AWS. Womens Housing Board». etc.)
— to be a legitimate voice of student opin-
ion.

2. SG fails to co-ordinate the following:

— programming with the Student Union

— budgeting with the Student Union

— activities of the various educational
cabinets

— fair selection and—or screening
procedure for representatives to faculty and
administrative committees

—-— student opinion on issues which should
be discussed in a truly representative body
which wields the powers of legitimate
representation of students.

2. SG does not represent the graduate.
part-time. or foreign students

4. Because of the disparity between SG's
purpose and its actual functioning at Pitt.
Student Government cannot. at this time.
coalesce student support from a variety of
sectors — academic: CAS. Engineering.
Nursing. Education. and interest groups:
IFC. Pan-Hel. AWS. Commuters. Black
Action Society. and Housing to create
significant pressure on the University —
faculty or administration. regarding any
issue of concern. While students have
retained their separate identity from the
faculty and administration. they have not
significantly co-ordinated their internal
operation as students. To be meaningful as
an agent of student opinion — of all schools.
all interest. all student classifications -
student government must look at itself and
begin to "bring all unrepresented factions
into a well—orgariized political structure
which can engender massive support on
issues and remedy thecurrent duplicities
and inadequacies. I  ’ T I

  
   

. city for commuters r A

How can student government begin this
self-evaluation?

1. By electing twenty~seven seniors
committed to this need for self-evaluation a
resolution will be passed which will
establish a committee to restructure
Student Government by March and present
a referendum on a new constitution to the
student body by mid-March.

2. Following the establishment of this
commission. the Senate will abolish itself as
a structure within Student Government.

Electing seniors guarantees no personal
aggrandizment in election to the post of
senator.

Electing seniors creates an immediate
pressure upon that commission to propose a

_ new Student Government within one month.

What are some of the issues will the
commission consider’? What are some of the

' alternatives available?

1 ) The determination of representatives to
faculty and administrative committees —
screen applicants through a central
committee
— screen applicants through a central
committee and return their names to the
student body for approval
—- direct election of the representat 2)
Representation on academic issues
4 expand current student involvement in
the CAS to the Schools of Engineering. Nurs-
ong. Pharmacy. Education -— where needed
— decentralize the current representation
by schools to the department level
— send department representatives to the
current academic cabinets
— assure greater co-ordination among
various academic bodies

3) Representation on interest group issues
— ensure representation of all interests
through Student Government

— consider whether the current SAA should
be strengthened. maintained. or entirely
restructured

— representation by geographic areas of the

    

     

; -A academic interests in Student Governance.

  

— representation by residence halls for
dorm students

4) General Issues
—: a unicameral or bicameral legislative
body ( for education and interest groups sep-
arately or jointly)

5) Consider how to compensate for the
many weaknesses already noted
— co-ordinating funds and programs with
the Student Union
— representation of graduate, part-time,
foreign students, etc.
— consider a constitutional requirement for
a budget fund to finance weekly Pitt News
coverage of SG activities, as well as the
establishment of a permanent director for

SG internal communication with the
students and among the various
committees.

Why will this proposal work when others
will fail???

1. Seniors have only the interest of SG at
heart— not personal interest in the position
of Senator. A

2. The commission to restructure is being
mandated by the student body —— if START is
elected — to present a proposal by MARCH.

3. The commission is composed of
sophomores, juniors and seniors
experienced in all phases of Student

Government problems at Pitt.

4. This commission will allow for a
number of openhearings to hear the views
of those not seated on the committee. The

commission does not anticipate a truly

democratic participation of all University
students —— but within the feasible realm of
representative government they will allow
an opportunity for all views to be discussed.

5. If START is elected — all twenty-four
senators must be elected to ensure a 2-3
majority for successful completion of our
plan.

6. The seniors are not constructing a
proposal which , fails, to consider the
complexity of interest groups as well as

    START, SCU
Merge: After
  2nd SC Debate

(Editor's Note: Due to a printing
deadline, the platforms of the Stu-
dent Community Union and the.
Start party appear on page one as
they were written prior to the mer-
ger. The lisfs of party candidates on
pages two and three were also
printed before the merger.)

by EVAN PATTAK
Staffwriter
The debate had. been going on
for some time. with presidential
candidates Harris Miller, Mike
Fabricant, and Steve Cundra in-

toning much of’ the same rhetoric

that pad characterized their ear-
lier debate. A student in the front
row.) perplexed by the polemics,
asked Miller and Fabricant why
they were running against each

other. when their platforms seem-

ed so similar.

Miller and Fabricant eyed the
questioner; neither could answer

him convincingly. When they ask- ,

ed the apocalyptic question of
each other much later that nigh-t
and still could find no answer,
they decided to combine their ef-
forts and run as one party.

"That question,” explained Fab-
ricant in the pre-dawnwhours of
Wednesday morning,” was the
catalyst for our merger. We had
been so busy getting petitions
signed and campaigning that this
was really the first chance we had
to talk to each other seriously.”

When the two candidates finally
did confer following the debate,
they agreed that their real and
imagined differences were auxili-
ary to" the major plant of both par-
ties, the restructuring of Student
Government (SG). , I

"The most important aspect of
the campaign,” reasoned Miller,
“is reforming the government.
Mike and I decided that a coalition
was the best means for assuring
the realization of that goal.”

Prior to Wednesday’s merger,
Fabricant’s “Start” party and
Miller’s “Student Community Un-
ion” (SCU) had diverged on the
actual means of remodeling SG.
Both advocated the abolition of
the SG Senate as the first step.
Miller, believed that the Consti-
tution written by him and several
of his party members would then
serve as the model for the re-
structuring effort. Fabricant, de-
siring a solution more represen-
tative’ of the entire student body_,
called for a commission to hold
open hearings on the issue.

Question: What do you plan to if
‘ you are elected?

Answer: ‘If elected I plan to:
(1) pass a resolution to establish
a Restructuring Commission
(RC) which will submit a pro-
‘posal for a student referendum by
mid-March; (2) following the es-

T tablishment of this Commission,

the Senate will abolish itself as a
structure within Student Govern-
ment; and (3) the RC will sched-
ule formal hearings with parties
interested in representation in the
new constitution.

Q.: What in your opinion are the

 ~ . most important distinctions be-

tween you and your opponents?
A.: START is campaigning for
the election of 23 seniors who
' share the experiences of familiar-
ity with the current strengths and
weaknesses of the present struc-
ture, and who are dedicated to re-_

structuring by March. These can-
didates share the feeling that a
rational restructuring cannot be
done in the fervor of a campaign
environment. The candidates have
pointed to the problems and they
intend to establish a mechanism
to deal with them—the RC.

The RC has been named and
given a deadline. The election of
START will be a mandate for the
institution of the Commission and
the completion of a proposal by
March. The Commission includes:
Dick Edgecom, president of Engi-
neering Cabinet; Carl VanHorn,

chairman of Freshman Orienta--

tion; Suzanne Slyman. former SG
Senator (who has done extensive
research on types of restructuring

Question:iWhat do you plan to
do if you are elected?

Answer: If I am elected, the
first concrete action that I plan to
take will be to present the Stu-
dent Government Constitution as
proposedby the Student Commun-
ity Union to the new Student Gov-
ernment Senate for passage so
that the proposal will become the
official document of the Student
Government. At the same time, I
will begin an intense recruiting
campaign throughout the cam-
pus to fill the man open positions
within the Student Government
structure.

On a more general level, there
will be a s‘rong attempt to reopen
the communications which have
fallen into such disarray. A full
time publicity director, I hopw.
will help to alleviate the problem
in this area. If the proposed Con-

. , stitutionj is passed» themain jobof '
S  the Student Government from the
president on down will be‘ to facil-_

itate students and coordinate stu-
dent activities. To achieve these
goals, a good system of communi-
cation is paramount.

Q.: What in your opinion are the
most important distinctions be-
tween you and your opponents?

A.: The major distinction be-
tween myself and Mr. Cundra
seems to lie in where we find the
faults of Student Government. Mr.
Cundra seems to be indicting the
personalities involved in Student
Government. blaming them for
the type of “Mickey Mouse" Stu-
dent Government that exists now.
From my point of view. the indict-
ment is not of the people but rath-
er of the structure. Certainly not
all the people in Student Govern-
ment during the past several
years have served to their full
capacity. but that does not mean
that the system is not at fault.

The fact remains that Student
Government as it is presently

ystructuredywith a legislative body

Harris Miller. candidate for pres-
ident (who has shown extensive
awareness to some of SG's prob-
lems); another student to be
named, preferably from the
School of Education; three advi-
sors——Holmes Wolfe. and a mem-
ber of the faculty and a member
of the Student Affairs staff.

This Commission [realizes that
students play an active rolein CAS
governance and consideration
must be given to extend the stu-
dents’ role in the governance of
other schools. This Commission
also realizes that many times the
faculty and administration regard
the representation of the interest
groups——IFC, MDS, AWS, Pan-Hel
and other organizations—ag le-
gitimate spokesmen for student
opinion, yet these groups are not
considered under the present con-
stitution adequately.

Q.: Why do you expect to suc-

ceed in your plans?

A.: The Commission will be
working under the pressure of a

general student body mandate.
The elected senior Senators have
no personal interest in the office.
and they are committed to this
plan for establishing the Commis-

\ sion.

. r «

The Commission. mandated to
submit a proposal by mid-March,
will hold formal hearings on spe-
cific topics in order to eliminate
the potential for philosophi har-
angues on the definitions of pow-
er. governance. etc.

Q.: What do you think is the ma-
jor problem on campus?

A.: Student Government. as it
is currently structured, doesnot
represent: (1) all interest goups
on campus. i.e.. academic depart-
ments, commuters. dorm resi-
dents, Greeks. the publications.
and other organizations; (2) co-
ordinated activities between dif-
ferent schools. between the Stu-
dent Government and the Student

Union and the Student Affairs Ad- V

visory Committee; (3) the real-
ities of student participation, i.e.
FAS committees. University Sen-
ate committees. appointments to
the Board of Trustee meetings.

Cundra Pledges Reform

Question: What do you plan to
do if you are elected?

Answer: I will firsticall for an
all-University Constitutional Con-
vention whose goal will be to de-
fine what the University govern-
ment will be and the students’
part in it. This convention will
have a deadline to create this def-
inition and come up with the need-
ed structure. In the meantime, I
will abolish the present Student
Government (SG) Senate and
place the Senators on student-fac-
ulty committees. Secondly. I will
reform the student services of
this campus. I will support such
organizations as HELP..«I will try
to create a year-round coffeehouse
for students. I will try to improve
entertainment on this campus
which has failed to appeal to many
students in the past. And if I ac-

’ complish both these goals. I hope

by my efforts to re-establish the
necessary unity and confidence
among students which is needed
if effective student representation
is to work. ‘ I

Q.: What in your opinion are the
most important distinctions be-
tween you and your opponents?

A.: The distinctions are many.
but they can be broken down into
basically four parts:

(1) My opponents represent the
past and they have failed to make
the past structure work or to
change it. Why follow them in the

Harris Miller  Present

is not workable and is not accept-
able. Student Government. by it-
self. can only facilitate students-—
it can have no actual power. That
is why my party and I are propos-
ing: (1) the removal of all legis-
lative functions from Student Gov-
ernment; (2) direct election to
University Senate Committee (for
that is where one of the real
sources of power in the Universi-
ty is located; and (3) the reten-
tion of the Student Government
structure that can aid students
here at the University.

The major difference between
me and Mr. Fabricant seems to
be that I have a definite proposed
constitution available now for
distribution that can and will be
voted upon immediately by the
new Student Government Senate.
whereas Mr. Fabricant is speak-
ing of restructuring Student Gov-
ernment sometime in the future.
For years students have been
promised that soon in the future

  

 

future? I represent real change.
realreform;

(2) The changes they propose
seem a bit nebulous or poorly
formed. What I propose is basic
structuralchange, not just in SG
but in relationship of SG with the
whole total University commun-
ity. Iplan to make us, the stu-
dents, an integral part of policy-
making in the University by giv-
ing us a substantial voice on the
University Senate, not just token
representation;

(3) My opponents who plan to
make this change do not represent
the broad-based opinion of the stu-
dents of this University. My tick-
et does. We represent all types of
people and thus we can represent
what we all feel the University
should be; and ~

(4) My opponents have ignored
the needed reformin University
student services of which we are
in dire need. I wish to improve en-
tertainment, health services. and
the basic atmosphere of the Pitt
campus.

Q.: Why do you expect to sue-
ceed in your plans?

A.: The reason that past SGs
were unsuccessful was that they
could not galvanize student opin-
ion into effective action. The rea-
son being they did not represent
all students. My party does. and
they do not just pledge it. We have
a coalition of all types of students.

Thus, by being able to represent
all students, we can effectively
unite student opinion behind us to
make our programs for reform,
work.

Q.: What do you think is the ma-
jor problem on campus?

A.: The major problem of this
campus cannot be pinpointed as
one thing or another. The prob-
lems are diverse. They include the
failure to work on the parking
problem, the failure to build a
Greek Row, the failure to care for
the basic problems, both emotion-
al legal, of the students, such as
with birth control and . many
others. Our main problem’ is es-
tablishing the means to solve these
diverse problems. Our means has
been SG. It has failed. Its failure
has been both its leadership and
its structure. What we promiseis
to change both of these weakness-

es. We will change structure by.

redefining the students’ role in
the University by taking a piece
of the action of policy-making for
the University which will enable
us to establish concrete programs
to solve student problems. But
most of all, we will change the
leadership. Our. new leadership
will be more effective because we
can identify with most students.
We offer the leadership that is
based on identification with all
students, not just a small clique
of students.

SC Constitution

they will be presented with a new
proposal for Student Government
and yet that promise has not been

~ kept. That is why the SCU has a

definitive constitution already
printed. Students will not have to
wait one month. or two months, or
six months for action. If I am
elected. the change will come now.

Q.: Why do you expect to suc-
ceed in your plans?

A.: I am running along with my
party on a platform that consists
basically of a proposed Constitu-
tion for Student Government. If I
am elected. that new Constitution
will be implemented for my elec-
tion is tantamount to support of
the proposed Constitution. My
plans will succeed if I am elected.

Q.: What do you think is the ma-
jor problem on campus?

A.: The major problem on cam-
pus doesnot seem to be so def-
inite that anyone can easily deline-

ate its‘ boundaries. but "yet  a

 
 

     

problem which we all experience.

It deals with personal identity, or

rather the lack of it, that we all
are feeling on campus. This is not
a problem that can be solved by
Student Government, obviously,
but it is, I feel, the major problem
on this campus and on many
others. Too many students caught
in this large University become
role players in search of identity.
We tend to forget that we are just
people-—not Greeks. not commu-
ters. not Student Government of-
ficers. This problem cannot be
handled by mere administrative
procedures or Student Govern-
ment mandates. It is a problem
that only students themselves. stu-
dents themselves. students as
people. can solve. We are all peo-
ple and must treat each other as
such. Compared to this problem.
issues such as beer in the Student
Union seem petty. It is time that
we put our concernrwhere‘ it be-
longs—on‘people.-  ’ 

Opinion

The Death Of Pitt???

by SCOTT BAUM
SG President

"It is not inconceivable that the
State Legislature would prolong
the appropriations impasse long
enough to ‘cripple or destroy the
University." This paraphrases a
statement made by Chancellor
Wesley Posvar at the January
meeting of the Board of Trustees.
when reporting on Pitt's financial
situation.

It is difficult to exaggerate the
disastrous implications of an in-
definite delay of the States alloca-
tion. Apparently -the problem is
not unfriendliness on the part of
the State Legislature. but rather
their fear of broadening the tax
base in an election _vear. Accord-
ing to Russ Arnold. Common-
wealth coordinator. some kind of
new tax will be necessary in or-
der to provide the revenue for allo-
cations to Pitt. Penn State and

Temple.

Presently the University is $17
million in debt. and will pass, the
$20 million mark in order to meet
the February payroll. The interest
rates alone are approximately $4.-
000 per day, and Pitt must contin-
ue to borrow until either its credit
runs out or an appropriation is
approved;

At this time of the year, the ad-
ministration should be involved in
budget planning for ’70-71, but

this planning obviously can’t be
done because this year’s budget
situation is unclear. One conse-
quence of this problem is that the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
(FAS) has been promised funding
for only 12 or 15 new faculty posi-
tions; with the present ratio of
student to faculty, and an antici-

pated increase of five per cent in ‘

next year’s College of Arts and
Sciences (CAS) enrollment, this
cutback in new faculty positions
will have grave implications for
undergraduate education in the
College.

The University Senate Council.
at its Jan. 19 meeting. discussed
various tactics to be employed in
hastening an end to the deadlock
in_the State Legislature. Propos—.
als ran from the suggestion that
all three schools——Pitt. Temple
and Penn State close down until
the initiation of a letter writing
campaign supporting .a new tax
levy.

It is unclear what tactic is most
appropriate. but something must
be done. The administration. in an
understandable effort to prevent
panic and a possible exodus of mo-
bile faculty from the University.
has tried to keep the issue toned
down. It is clear. however. that
Pitt is in desperate financial
straits. and students. staff. and
faculty must recognize the prob-
lem. Students must begin writing
letters to their Senators and Rep-
resentatives and must convince
their parents to do the same. If
students and their parents value
the education students are getting
here at Pitt and are concerned
with the quality of that education.
they have no choice.

Without political support for
new tax measures. the Legislative
will not vote to broaden the tax
base. and there will simply be no
money to give Pitt. Without that
money. over a long enough period
of time. Pitt may simply die.

From Registrar To

by R. V. ALLSHOUSE

Numerous complaints have
been made concerning the fail-
ure of the Registrar’s Office
to notify the students who have
been enrolled in a particular
course or section when depart-
ments change those courses or
sections after registration.
Perhaps an explanation of the
procedures involved would be
helpful.

Class cards are pulled for each
course when a student registers.
The class cards are then mated
with the students name address
cards and forwarded to Adminis-

trative Systems. Here the stu-
dents name, number. sch_ool code

and sex are punched into the class
cards. Throughout the registra-
tion period this information is
sorted daily by student number
and loaded to a master invoice
tape. After invoices are run from‘
this tape. class rosters are run
from it. Since this is the current
procedure. the Registrar's Of-
fice does not know who is enrolled
in the courses that have been
changed until invoicing is com-
pleted and class rosters forward-
ed from Administrative Systems.

Cognizant of the shortcomings
of this procedure. the Registrar‘s
Office is currently working with
Administrative Systems to pro-
vide class rosters at a much ear-
lier date. Unitl this approach be-

Discusses Middle East Conflict

 

by Steve Lubetsky
Staff Writer

At the Students for Israel meet- I

ing. held a week ago in Room 104
of the Common Facilities Build-
ing. Dr. Richard Cottam describ-
ed Americas Middle East policy
as essentially one of "innocence."

The professor of Middle East
politics referred to the King-
Krane Commission. which was or-
ganized in 1918. This commission
was named by President Woodrow
Wilson to investigate the possi-
bility of the establishment of a
Jewish state in Palestine. The
commission concluded that such
an endeavor would create only
tension. and Israel would be too
weak to survive an attack.

In "assuming a position, Dr.
Cottam explained, there were
several factors which the United
States had to consider..First of
all, there was pressure from eth-
nic groups - Jews, who yearned
desperately for a national home-
land, and Arabs, who vigorously
opposed such an idea. ,

There were also pressures from
economic groups, who were hos-
title to the proposal because they
had oil interests.

Finally, the complications that
would be produced carried enor-
mous weight.

The decision to support the crea-
tion of Israel, which came about
during the Truman Administra-
tion, was the result of three fact-
ors, Dr. Cottam asserted: The
guilt that this country bore fol-
lowing the murders of 6,000,-
000 Jews, the contributions of
Jews to the political and economic
system, and the pressures ap-
plied by Zionist groups.

The professor further empha-
sized the pro-Israeli attitude
of President Truman.

American support declined.
however. due to the expansion
of the Cold War. Since theISoviet
Union demonstrated its support
for the Arabs. the United States
government felt that American
troops might be needed for Israel‘s

defense. Also. the thought of
alienating the Arabs disturbed
American oil companies.

Again Zionists applied -pres-
sure. and again the United States
found itself in a dilemma. The
government hunted for what Dr.
Cottam referred to as "a magic
solution to please everybody."

This "magic solution" pro-
claimed American support for
the Jewish state. while pledging
support of conservative Arab
regimes only. Such an approach
pleased the American Jewish
community and concurrently
satisfied oil companies also. since
revolutionary regimes were too
great a risk to begin with.

Since the June War of 1967.
Dr. Cottam ovserved that Amer-
ican policy has been shifting once
again. There is growing concern
right now about Soviet agres-
siveness, he declared It has been
noticed, he continued. that even
the more conservative Arab
regimes are becoming increas-
ingly violent. Since the oil indus-
try is determined to maintain
its influence, it naturally is voic-
ing support for the Arabs.

The Roger’s Peace Plan‘ ac-
cording to Cottam. is the result
of the governments “‘innocent"
policy. The plan is devised to deal
only with Egypt and Jordan-
the more conservative Arab reg-
imes—whereas the Israeli govern-

ment is seeking to deal with all

this plan calls for withdrawal of
troops from Israeli-occupied
territory. Israel views it as a
threat to her security.

In conclusion, Dr. Cottam pre-
dicted the course of American

Middle East policy. Should the 1?

as a significant threat, the Unit-

for the State of Israel and will ‘It

Parties Merge

("Continued from Page 1)

After conferring with their fol-
lowings, the two party’ leaders met
to iron out a compromise arrange-
ment.

“What emerged,” related Fab-
ricant, “was our supporting of
Harris and his slate and their sup-
porting of our idea.”

According tothe conditions of
the agreement. Miller and Shep
Goldberg. Miller's original run-
ning mate. will be the presiden-
tial and vice-presidental candi-
dates. and the SCU‘s slate of sen-
atorial aspirants will remain in-
tact. The party will retain the
name of the Student Community
Union. Fabricant. his running
mate Dave Tiernan. and all but
three of their nominees for Sen-
ate will. in effect. withdraw from
Dianne Ulyon. Dick
Birchkbichler. and Rick Sammet.
originally "Start“ candidates. will
run with the SCU to fill that par-
ty‘s slate.

If elected. the SCU slate will put
aside Miller's Constitution and
mandate a 9—student restructur-
ing commission. Named to the
committee by Fabricant were
Carl Van Horne. Suzanne Sl_vman.
Jeannie Katz. Judy Lewandowski
and Dick Edgecombe. Still to be
selected are three students by
Miller. one more by Fabricant.
and one advisor each representing
the trustees. the faculty. and the
administration.

The -commission will listen to
all proposals and will, by March
10, send its recommendation to the
Senate for passage. It will then be
submitted to the studentbody as
a referendum. If the commission
cannot agree on a suitable rec-
ommendation, Miller’s Constitu-

tion will be presented to the Sen- 

ate. — '

Though a shock to many.- the
merger did not surprise the "Unit-
ed Student Coalition‘s“ candidate

Cundra. "They were really advo-
cating the same things-—only per-

fact." explained the junior nomi-I ~

less they thought I was well in the

Hello, Dolly

Contributing Critic
 Once a show is performed on
 Broadway and succeeds, any sub-
sequent production of that show
- . - is almost always subject to com-

_ ___parison. If it is the script that

‘ makes the difference. then we
critique the show. If. however.
i the star makes the show. then it
 is the leading role that is most
 subject to review. In/‘the case of
 “Hello Dolly.“ the book-is only
 fair. and without the vibrant char-

acter of "Dolly" serving to sus-
. ztain it when it is low (about 60‘;
_ » of the time) it can be somewhat

-dissappointing as a final product.
7 Even while being an enjoyable and
,worthwhile production. it may
 less than adequately reproduce
 the originaland thus fall short of
representing theatrically. that
which is intended__ to duplicate.
This is the"case. if we make com-
;,parison. with Barbra Streisand
-starring in the cinema versionof
. “Hello Dolly.“

«  “Hello » Dolly." the musical.
was adapted from the stage com-’
 edy "The Matchmaker" by Thorn-

 ton Wilder. and loosely at that.

However. if you are a big time
producer with a costly film-
you look for a super star and
Carol Channing is not. There-

cial success of your production.
Thus to film comes "Dolly“ and
to that role ascends Barbra Strei-
sand.

Streisand became a star with

“Funny Girl” on Broadway— ‘

but gained statuseas a super star
because of public exposure as a
singer. And, as often‘ happens, she
was offered various juicy roles
with the hopes of jingle, jingle
at the box office. In “Funny Girl”
she had a lot of things going for
her, for although the script was
weak in many areas-—-her dynamic
performance and interpretation
of Fanny Brice was an outstand-
ing one indeed. In “Dolly” she just
doesn't have it. It is as if Dolly
Levi was playing Barbra Streis-
and. When Miss Streisand isn’t
playing it that way, she plays her
as Mae West, and in some slight

instances, Fanny Brice (I thought
sure that at one point she would
break into “My Man.) Of course,
there is also the “Jewish Mother”
image as if Molly Picon of Gert-
rude Berg, from beyond, had been
coaching from the side.

All of these things are fine.
but alas in this mis-modge of
interpretation. where is Dollv
Levi‘? In fact. she is. with the
exception of a few instances. no-
where to be found. The only two
scenes. in which Miss Streisand

_ appears that could be called super-

ior to any others I have seen on
the stage. are the Harmonia
Gardens dining scene and the fol-
lowing one in which she tells
Horace Vandergelder goodbye
and that he can cuddle up to his
cash register. It is therefore

Streisand you see (26 years of age A

and playing “Dolly" who is “too
long the widow") romping around
doing a bad inpersonation of the
part she plays. but being a pretty
good Streisand. As Streisand.
and I happen to enjoy her in most
instances. she is delightful in
every way for every reason that
her fans flock to see her. With
her comic talents well at hand
she must be doing the best she can.

The film was made a year and
a half ago at a cost of nearly 20
million dollars. but not released
because of David Merrick's
determination to get as much
money out of his stage produc-
tions as possible, It is rumored
that he received one million dol-
lars to release the film in addi-
tion to the other concessions that
20th Century Fox had to come
up with. Being one of the last of
_the big films. and costly at that.

  Venture:

Answer that one and you'll open up a
whole new ﬁeld of solid state physics
that just might come to be called
"excitonics." Because the most excit-
ing thing about excited molecules in
solids, right now, is that no one knows
what to do with them.

This intriguing state of affairs came
about after physicists began firing
photons into molecular crystals and
observing the results. Which were:
“excitons."

An exciton is a conceptual entity that
has more “stateness” than “thingness"
about it. When a photon strikes a
molecule in an organic crystal with
sufficient energy, it bumps an electron
to a higher energy level, leaving a
"hole" in the molecule. in the brief
interval before it falls back into its hole,
the electron releases the energy it re-
ceived from the photon, which propa-
gates another hole-electron pair in a
neighboring molecule, and thus on

through the crystal.

This phenomenon is called the
“singlet" excited state: or the singlet
exciton. Du Pont scientists have pro-
duced it with a 150-watt bulb. In the
singlet, an electron is excited without
any change in direction of its spin or
magnetic moment. It dies quickly, and
a blue light emerges from the crystal.
But with an intense light source, such
as the laser, an even more interesting
excited state has been produced: the
"triplet." 1

in the triplet, the spin of the excited
electron is reversed, a magnetic ﬁeld
is produced, and the excited state lasts
a million times as long—-about a hun-
dredth ofa second. Du Pont researchers
have also found that two triplets can
combine. producing a singlet exciton
with greatly increased energy and a
life span of a hundred millionth of a
second. Of promising interest is that
this tendency of triplets to merge can

be sensitively controlled by applying a 4

magnetic field to the crystal.

Perhaps the next step will be the
engineering of devices that manipulate
light signals directly, bypassing the
present need to convert them first into
electrical signals and then back into
light. Perhaps too this line of research
will lead to greater understanding of
the mechanisms of light-energy trans-
fer itself, such as those involved in
photosynthesis by living plants. The
possibilities are many.

materials and putting them to work,

The enactment of the freshman eligibility rule has

added depth, talent and instant success to a number of

varsity squads this season. The track team is no exception.

Doug Degenhart brought a share of the Ohio State
schoolboy pole vault record with him to Pitt, and he has
wasted no time in erasing the existing varsity and Field

As a senior in high school, Degenhart cleared 14’6”,
a heighth which equalled the
heighth. As a junior, he had cleared the 14’ barrier.

And Saturday, in his first varsity competition for
coach Jim Banner, Dengenhart cleared 14’8”, clipping
four inches off the Field House mark.

But the blond-haired fresh from Fairborn, Ohio isn’t
satisfied with his record breaking performance. “Four-
teen-eight is nothing,” he commented. “As far as every-

17’10 3/4 inches, and Degenhart would someday hope to

all of which have been defeats.
Kent State's current record stands
at three wins and eight losses.
Against the_Panthers' latest vic-
tims. Penn State. the Flashes
dropped a 61-57 decision.

The Panthers. meanwhile. are re-
cently pulling themselves out of
the dumps and into prosperity. The
optimistic Jungle Cats lost six of
their first seven encounters. But in
the last three games. they have
captured victories and dropped the
other contest by only a point.

‘ “Our shooting has picked-up, and
we now have more confidence.
We’ve also got a good, aggressive
defense, and I’ve been satisfied

the way our players have been .

coming along. We’ve gotten a

sound game out of our players X
-during the last three games,” re-

marked Ridl.

One aspect which he could not
ignore when speaking about the
cagers‘ recent improvement was
the reduction of turnovers. In
Saturday’s Penn State conquest. the
cagers didn’t produce one‘ turn-
over for a 10 minute period of the
second half.

"If we can continue to cut
down on turnovers," stated Ridl.
"and also play the same of-
fense and defense that we have
been, then we’ll have a good.
sound team.”

Ridl knows that his squad will
have to roll along the same
path that they had followed in
Saturday’s trouncing of the Nit-
tany Lions in order to knock -
off Kent State.

“Kent has a strong team.
They’ve got a strong inside game.
a deliberate offense. and an ag-
gressive defense.” Ridl stated.

The Golden Flash attack moves
inside and back out. It usually
gives one of the guards the op-
portunity for a clear shot from
the top of the key. They’re known
for their efforts to work for the
good shots while
wheeling the ball in and out.

BUS CONTINUES

Free campus bus service will
continue to be provided for the
home basketball contests. To-
night the bus will begin running

and continue until 8:15. Game

with Kent State is 8:15.

 

TRACK NOTES

Jim Banner’s tracksters won‘t
have many free weekends this
winter. Because of the abundance
of superior athletes they’re aren‘t
very many invitations that have-
n’t asked for thinclad representa-
tives.

The track squad will travel
across the state to compete in the
Philadelphia Track Classic this
weekend with competition begin-
ning Friday night.

Last year the thinclads gave a
pretty good showing in the City of
Brotherly Love. Smitty Brown
was the big‘ thinclad name in the
classic, finishing second in the
600-yard run ‘and anchoring the
mile relay team to a victory in
the open division.

1 ‘flit

Degenhart started vaulting in junior high, but
stardom didn’t come instantly. “I saw other guys and lik-
ed it,” he explained. “It was fun, but I wasn’t any good
at first. It wasn’t till my freshman year that I started
to get better.”

With all kinds of collegiate and world records fall-
ing, Degenhart feels it’s simply a matter of time until
someone breaks the 18 foot barrier in the pole vault. The
young freshman sees the barrier as more of a mental
obstacle than anything else. “Once one person clears it,
many others will. It’s just a mental barrier right now.
But somebody will clear it.”

Degenhart is impressed with the track program here
and he definitely has his sights set on bettering Satur-
day’s record performance. He also looks forward to the
outdoor season this spring, where he “should do better.”

Matmen Trounce WVU

by MARTHA HARTLE
Sports Editor

Allen decisioned Roger Lamens. 7-1, in the 190 pound
classification.

Freshman Al Cox was a surprise starter for
Adams’ matmen in the 118 pound match and he was
credited with a win on a forfeit. Adams pointed out
that Cox could, be a real “sleeper” on the squad and
that he had just come out for the team on Monday.
“He did a little bit of wrestling in high school,”
Adams added.

Pat Lavery dropped a tough match in the 150

Sweeping eight of the ten individual matches. the
grapplers picked up their fifth win of the season last
night by trouncing arch-rival West Virginia. 32-8.

Coach Dave Adams cited the agressiveness of
his team as the major factor in the victory. "We did-
n‘t lose a takedown until the heavyweight match.“
Adams explained. "In fact. we had a 14-2 margin on
them in takedowns. That's just one indication of
how aggressive we are. We went right out after
them."

time Virginia state champion. won the match on rid-
ing time.

Lavery took an early lead in the match on take-
downs in both the first and second periods. but John-
son came back with an escape. a reversal and time
to win. “It was a real good match.“ Adams com-
mented. “But Pat just couldn‘t shake him in the last
period."

Included among the eight individual wins for the
grapplers were three falls. Freshman Gary McC+
Clure remained undefeated at 126 as he pinned Joe
Fedor in 3:51. Scott Ross. also an undefeated frosh.
pinned Jim Leete at 2:20 in the 234 pound match.

And junior Bob Kuhn got back on the winning
track as he pinned Don Roofner in the 167 bout.
Kuhn is-5-1 on the year, with his only defeat coming
at the hands of the defending Eastern champ.

Sophomore Dave Wylie picked up his first win
of the season at 142 with a 4-0 win over Dennis Acita.
while Buddy Morris won his second straight with a
7-3 win over Jere Engle.

Baseball season is a long way off, but the profes-
sional teams held their winter draft last week and the
number one collegiate pick is no stranger to the Panther
mitters.

The UCLA first baseman who was the top pick of the
majors faced Bobby Lewis’ team in.a California tourney
two years ago, and mitter Frank Gustine recalls that “he
was good, but he committed two errors against us.” Gus-
tine was the winning pitcher in a 4-3 Panther win.

At heavyweight, freshman Jim Caramanna was
pinned by Bob Vettorel at 1:04, but according to
Adams the match was a close one. With the match
tied in the final period, Vettorel took Caramanna
down on his back and got the fall.

Last night's victory boosts the grapplers' sea-

son record up to 5-1 and the matmen have yet to see

Grant°s Tankers Seek First Win;

Diving Remains Strongest Point

by JERRY MYERS

Rebounding off a tough loss to Bucknell in their
first meet last Saturday. the swimmers will chal-
lenge the Mountaineers of West Virginia at the WVU
pool this afternoon.

In their second of four straight away meets. the
mermen appear confident of picking up thier first
victory of this young campaign. According to coach
Bill Grant. "West Virgina is good. They are pretty
spread out this year. with no particular real strong
point. But we should beat them."

Although last year can hardly be a criterion for

this season, the mermen still have to avenge the
trouncing the Mountaineers gave them in the '69

meet. The difference will be that in the past the

Mountaineers have taken advantage of their mem-
bership in the NCAA which allows the use of fresh-
men in all their meets. Grant‘s swimmers in the
past have gone along with the ECAC ruling which
forbids the use of frosh. As of this year. that ruling
is no longer in affect and freshmen swimmers will
be in their first competition of the season today.

Dave Wessel was the star in a losing cause last
year as be shattered his own school record and also
set a new Trees Pool mark in one meter diving. The
West Virginia pool did not have a three meter diving
board last year so that part of the diving competi-
tion was not counted.

In Hoop Prelim

Wessel has not turned in the kind of performance
he thrilled the audiences with last year as yet. but

according to coach Grant it is because. “the judges

have been very critical of Dave." In addition it must
be noted that Wessel has only had one meet to show
his stuff. He promises to be in top form today.

The second half of Grants diving duo is Chester
Zientek. Zientek turned in some pretty fine diving
against Bucknell and will be on hand again today.
Coach Grant says. "Chester is a good hard worker.
He never dove until he came to Pitt and now he's a
starter. Most divers‘ have been diving since they
were nine or ten so that gives you an idea how far
Chester has come along in the last four years."

Coach Grant again commented on the fact that
the meet was away. He feels that swimming at
home is the same as having a home court advantage
in basketball. When the team travels “the swim-
mers can adjust but the divers have a lot more trou-
ble." Grant cites the fact that the mermen have to
go from the ultra-modern Trees Hall pool to the 35
year old Mountaineer tank which defintely have an
affect on the swimmers’ performance.

The mermen have been working out everyday.
sometimes going with double workouts in prepara-
tion for today’s meet and for Saturday’s meet
against Penn State. -

winter. winning the first game

Neiger doesn’t know how to
prepare his gymnasts for West
Virginia because this will only be
the first meet for the Mountain-
eers this year.

“I don’t know what to expect
from them,” Coach‘ Neiger an-
swered when asked him what he
expects from the Mountaineers.”
This will be their first meet and I
can’t make any judgment about
them until after we face them.

"I know they’re always tough
when we face them and I expect
another cliffhanger with them."

Last year the. gymnasts edged
the Mountaineers, 112.30 to 111.70.
so the Mountaineers will be just a
little hungry for revenge.

The Mountaineers posted an 8-4
record last season but will find it
a little harder to match or better
that mark.

Lack of experience and depth
will be troubling the Mountaineers
for the entire season. There are
only five Iettermen returning and
their success will be riding on un-
tried sophomores and freshmen.

_ Senior Paul Gross is counted on
to give the Mountaineers strength

in the all-around competitiong

Other help in the all-around will
come from junior Steve Albert. a
transfer from Miami Junior Col-
lege.
