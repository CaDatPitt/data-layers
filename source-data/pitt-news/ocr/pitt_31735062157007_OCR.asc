Registration Mill Speeds Up

By Dick Kovar
Upperclassmen last week walk-
ed upright out of Syria Mosque
for the first time since the war.
No longer did R—Day at the
Mosque rival D-Day at Norman-

dy, and the registration desks
hardly resembled ration queues
at all.

Though the initial wave of reg-
istrants was delayed slightly at
the door Wednesday, Feb. 6, while
last minute rpreparations were
made,_ Registrar John G. Quick
was able to beam happily as he
watched students passing the last
desk at 9:30 a. m. The pre-reg-
istered seniorsihad run the gamut

   

in a record Y5 minutes, while
those with schedule changes
plugged along not far behind.
Because the Mosque auditorium
was in use, students were forced
to spend a little time waiting
outside until they were ushered
inside to line ‘up in the upper
lobby. »
From there they lilcd down-
stairs, picked up grade sheets, had
them checked, received a few
forms to fill out, and sat down in
the uncrowded writing section,
breathing easily as they dashed
off the few lines of information
required. So far, so good. ‘
At this ‘point, the Registrar's

J

  

smoothly-oiled machine collided
head-on with the Dean of Men's
broken down 1945 model. A long,
shuffling line pushed out into the
kitchen to crowd between nar-
row tables while unconcerned
young men thumbed through ac-
tivities ﬁles, asked ambiguous
questions, and ended, as a "mule,
by writing a string off ditto
marks on a blue card.

When the line inched back into
the main hall, it halted again
While each student’s ID card was
stamped, if he happened to have
it with him. While a few unfor-

  

  

Wunates were sidetracked for a

moment for their ID pictures, the
rest of the line once more moved
along rapidly to the last number-
ed card, then mounted the stairs,
either to pay tuition or straggle
over to the Masonic Temple to“
cope with a still-snarled VA of-
lice.‘

Aside from those who had’
schedule changes to make at the
Mosque, students who still had
trouble included college students
who were carrying engineering
courses, graduate students, and
the poor incoming :freshmen who.
arrived Monday and Tuesday; to
ﬁnd important classes‘ closed.

Ordinarily ‘S-ple-aki_r_i_g, Mr. Ordinary Student
is justiﬁed in his snicker at the power of the
powerless student governing groups at Pitt.
Likewise, he adds another inner chuckle at
V the power of the alumni.

Last October, Student Congress attempted
"a probe of the athletic situation with an eye
toward improvement or “getting out of. the
big league.” This probe met with widespread
approval throughout the prodigious student
body and alumni. ’

The trouble with the approval was evident
from the beginning. The more rabid Pitt sup-
porters were anxious to apply the ax. VVhere
the ax was to be applied varied with each
Amember of these groups. Most antagonism cen-
tered on the heads of Jimmy Hagan and Mike
Milligan.

The aim of the student probe and the re-
sults to be achieved were commendably far
from this move. It sought to go into the mat-
ter much further_ than the “fall guys.” Ac-
tually, the probe set about to ﬁnd the broad
and speciﬁc answers to two evident questions:
Why does Pitt choose a suicide schedule year
after year on de—emphasized material and back-
ing? VVhy do hundreds of Western Pennsyl-
vania athletes annually migrate to the greener
pastures of the Southern and Mid-western“
campuses?

If heads should fall in the meanwhile, it
is to achieve an end and not the end in itself.

Present indications show that the long
awaited oﬁicial statement of the Temporary
Committee on Athletics, set up by the chan-
cellor in answer to Student Congress charges,
will arrive at the end of the month. The mem-
bers of this committee have worked many
hours to ﬁnd some logical an_swers.

In the absence of official reports, a policy
of no publicity set up by the Committee, it is
evident that material progress has been made.
For once, it looks more thorough and more
complete than any previous investigation.

The evidence to date refutes Mr. Ordinary
Student’s snicker. The ﬁnal results, however,
will‘ indicate whether the student governing
groups have a say in their own future. ‘

, Leaps and Bounds

_ Registrar Quick and Assistant Batchelder
‘tfhrew ‘more well aimed‘ puiiches at the usual
hodgepodge of red tape surrounding that reg-
istration ordeal. Their pre-registration-plan,
although still in infant form and not free of
the inherent bugs of any new plan, met with
gratifying success at the lines last week. A

Two ﬂaws were evident, but were minor
in the speed up system. Selection of new cours-
es involved considerable time, with the person
who set up an entirely new schedule in the
same boat as during previous registrations.
The private sale of ‘class cards during pre-
‘iﬁegistration, although existant, fell far below
the rumored proportions of the racket.

, .

‘The plan deserves commendation to the Re-
gistrar’s Oﬁice for reducing registration time
to well under an hour for most students.

Issue

 

By Bill Veenis

Josiah Kirby Lilly means little more than the
large stone expanse bearing his name to many

thousand Pitt student. A few would be familiar
with the Work he has done to .provide the Uni-

versity and the world with. the extensive collection
of Fosteriana housed in Stephen Foster Memorial.

A very few fortunate individuals knew Josiah
Lilly in his everyday existence. The few who
knew him well realized that Lilly was one of a;
minority among successful business executives. In‘
a ﬁeld where business acumen usually means un-
orthodox, sometimes crooked, practice, and where
success is measured on the number of persons or
factions left in the dust, Lilly was the exception.

   

He typiﬁed the true higher education ideal
in that he believed in the rights of his brother.
FeVv"‘”ftems were too small to be overlooked by
his acute mentality; few men were too insig-
niﬁcant to merit his attention. He was a.
thoughtful executive —— plus.

In presenting to Pitt the literally staggering col-
lection of records and data on the life of Stephens,
Foster, Lilly paid an overwhelming tribute to the
University, to the City of Pittsburgh, but more, to
his own inherent unselﬁshness. Born and reared
in the Hoosier state, Lilly graduated from De Paul

Institute. His allegiance is to the state of Indiana
even to the location of Eli Lilly & Co. Manufactur- ».
ing Chemists.

But, in his own mind, it was beyond ques-
tion that the collection of Fostoriana, valued at
more than $150,000, should stay in Indiana, for-
eign ground as far as the Pittsburgh composer
was concerned.

..a

Josiah Kirby Lilly died earlier this week, but
the University ‘of Pittsburgh will retain much in
evidence of his undying devotion to his ideals. A
memorial scroll has been placed on the portrait"
of Lilly in Foster Hall, an insigniﬁcant tribute to

a great man. ,

” Philip Wylie in a recent arti-

are some examples:

“Her (college—educated women)
chances of divorce are greater . . .”
According to Dr. Roland Warren,
head of the department of sociol-
ogy, divorce is correlated with
high income groups as well as
with college graduates; and there
is a question of exactly where to
place the blame. Dr. Warren add-
ed “Desertion is the poor man’s
divorce,” and complete ﬁgures on
desertion are impossible to obtain.
Moreover,.divorce is no measure
of the number of unhappy mar-
riages; and statistics do show that
of happily married couples a
greater percentage are college
graduates. ’

This brings us to a point which
should arouse the ire of any

Josiah Lilly
Dies at 75

The man who established the
world’s ﬁnest tribute to one of -

America’s musical geniuses has
died.

Josiah K. Lilly, industrialist and
philanthropist, died after a long
illness Sunday, Feb. 8 at the Meth-
odist Hospital in Indianapolis. The

musical genius to whom he paid .

‘tribute was Stephen Collins Fos-
ter, Pittsburgh’s own son.

Mr. Lilly, on June 2, 1937, at the
dedication of the Stephen Foster
Memorial, presented to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh-“in trust to
the people of America” a collec-
tion of the finest Fosteriana in ex-
istence.

Made at an approximate cost
of $160,000 the collection contain-
ed 10,000 indexed items of ﬁrst,
early, and modern editions of Fos-
ter songs, original pictures and
portraits, song books, magazines,
and books mentioning Foster.

Mr. Lilly, when presenting the

collection, said the “only condi-
tions following the gift are that
the collection be creditably main-
tained and made available for
view and study by the public un-
der rules and regulations to be
established by the trustees of the
’ University of Pittsburgh.”

Thus, the collection has been on
display at the Foster Memorial
where hundreds of visitors each
year examine the early editions
and manuscripts of one of the
most famous folk song writers in
the world. The Memorial is al-
ways open to the students of the
University. '

He became superintendent of
the laboratories in 1882 following
his graduation from the Philadel-
phia College of Pharmacy. By the
next year he was offering to the
wholesale trade a full line of as-

tracts, the first standard line avail-

Lilly is perhaps best known for
his research in an effort to ﬁnd
a way to manufacture commer-
cially the derivative from the pan-

sulin, which was believed might
help suﬁerers of diabetes.

After 34 years service as presi-
dent of the business ﬁrm, Lilly
turned over the job to his son Eli
Lilly, and became the chairman of
the board of directors.

It was then, about 1929, he be-
came interested in the music of
Foster and began concentration on
the job of popularizing it all over

Open to Uninsu

red Students

A student insurance plan, popularly referred to as hospitaliza-
tion beneﬁts, has been arranged again by the University to protect
students against unexpected and unusually large hospital care ex-

penses.
The insurance is effective for

12 consecutive months, beginning

in September. However, enrollment is permitted during February

registration for half the annual cost.

\

The plan includes two types 01¢

insurance: the hospital and medi-
cal care plan for students living
away from home, and the hospital
care plan for students living at
home.

Both types pay costs, up to $65,

wsci= Sets Aside Sunday

As Universal 'Day of Prayer'

This Sunday will be celebrated throughout the world as a day
of prayer among the World’s Student Christian Federation.

This year will be signiﬁcant as the second post-war celebra-
tion. It will derive its impetus and set new attitudes received from
the Oslo Conference in Norway last year.

All of the colleges’ in Pittsburgh will observe this day with
chapel services and smaller meetingsnlt is an all inclusive organi-

zation combining the student YMO

CA and YWCA with several other
groups. It works in its service de-
partment -—~ the World Student
Service Foundation — with Pax
Romana and Hilliel Foundation.
“This organization emphasizes
student relation both at home and
in foreign gountries and it feels

that it is one of the most effective
ways for a better understanding
among people of this generation.

“This Federation is a way of
integrating attitudes about the
world situation today. Through
activity in the various under-
ground movements during the
war, we have been able to get
first hand information of the needs
of these students in Europe,”
states Mrs. Edna Batz, YWCA di-
rector. A

The World Student Service
Fund has helped relieve these
needs in some measure.

This work among the students
will be recognized in the chapel
service on Feb. 15. a

Pitt Shooting

Against Titans

It’s “Operation Dixie Cup”
tomorrow night when Dr. H. C.

Titans.

enters the fray as a decided un-
derdog. '

Grover C. (Pappy) Washa-
b‘augh’s towering Titans who
have won ten and lost six, aver-
age well over 60 points a game
compared to Pitt’s meager 42
markers per contest. With such
scoring power the men from New

Wilmington are top heavy favor- ..

ites.

But the Fatigue Curve adher-
ents feel that science and spirit
will triumph over speed and
height and put them at the .500
mark for the ﬁrst time this sea-
son. The Panthers have won eight
and dropped nine.

Neither of the contestants have
been. able to win against top-
flight competition although Pitt
did upset Army, 42-41. The clash
represents a struggle for suprem-
acy between the - two top teams
among the district small fry.

Despite the odds the sometimes
surprising Caravan ’will probably
befuddle their taller adversaries
and bring back victory number
nine.

Ed Sudzina, Pitt’s distance run-
ning star, came in a close second
in the recent AMA “Outstanding
Athlete” awards. '

‘Doc Carlson’s fatigue theory
paid off a few dividends Wednes-
day night as his highly-condition-
ed ﬁve rolled over Allegheny, 51-
33. Wise substitution coupled with
an organized offense was all the
Pitts needed to register their third
straight victory.

Allegheny’s erratic Gators dis-’

played little in the way of bas-
ketball ﬁnesse although they did
connect on some amazing one-
handed shots during the fast ﬁrst
half. After the intermission the
issue was never in doubt.

Petro Assaults Records

Following the last dual meet
with Penn State next Saturday,
the Pitt mermen rest from com-
petition until March 13 and the
Eastern Collegiate championships
at Rutgers University.

Dandy Dick Petro’s assault on
the school records is attracting a
lot of attention. The Uniontown
free-style sprinter tied one mark
and eclipsed another one in the
Slippery Rock meet, his ﬁrst as a
Panther.

His 24.5 seconds in the 50-yard
free style and 54.7 seconds in the
100-yard event made the ﬁrst dent
in the records since .1940. I

Manko Continues Streak

Petro tied Walt Nowotney’s' 50-
yard standard and topped the 100-
yard mark, which had stood since
1938.

Bill Manko, 31-year-"old back-
stroker, carded his seventh
straight dual meet victory in.his
specialty during the Slippery
Rock meet.

The ‘Geneva meet Wednesday
was cancelled by the Beaver Falls
school due to the illness of several
members of the -Geneva team.
Previously, Western Reserve,
Kenyon, and Oberlin had with-
drawn from meets with Pitt.

Call for Baseball

Canddates Soon

With the basketball season in
its ﬁnal stages, baseball interest
at Pitt is picking up‘ as Coach
Ralph Mitterling prepares to em-
bark on another winning season.

Mitterling has issued no formal
call for tryouts as yet, but it is
expected that he will do so by the
last week of February. Pitchers
and catchers will probably start
practice under the Stadium the
first week of March. ;

Inﬁelders are usually put , to
work several weeks later and out-
ﬁelders shortly after. '

All of last year’s regulars are
back plus Sammy David, an’ ef-
fective hurler who pitched in 1946

‘but was ineligible last season.

The Panthers compiled a record
of six wins and three losses last
season, dropping a double header
to Penn State and a single game
to Juniata.

Try Wafching Ben Grady’:
Swim Team If You Want

I  1. Cheer (1 Sure Winner

By John Golightly

Take my word for it a swimming meet can be interesting
and at times downright exciting. I discovered this during the
recess when I accompanied Bob Van Atta, our swimming re-
porter, to the /Slippery Rock-——Pitt match at the YMHA. .

Accustomed to the delays which plague that other minor
sport king-—track, I was surprised at the swift pace with which

this match was run off. v

The Panther natators required
only an hour and ﬁfteen minutes
to complete the nine events and

pwallop the Rockets, 59-16. Van

Atta assured me this was accord-
ing to form. The meets rarely take
more than 75 minutes and Pitt al-
ways wins.

Petro Rates Olympic Chance

A winning team should be
enough to attract even the most
lethargic sport fan. But in case
you’re still doubtful, Coach Ben
Grady . has Dick Petro, . a 19-

- year-old breaker, who is sure ﬁre

excitement everytime he hits the
Water.

Petro tied the record for the 50
yard free style with a 24.5 effort,
then went on to chip one-tenth of
a second from Walter Nowotney’s
1938 mark of 54.7 for the 100 free
style.

In a previous exhibition he
swam the 100-yard event in 53.6
which not only broke the Pitt
mark but set a new record for the
YMHA pool. Close ob-servers pre-
dict Petro is an excellent prospect
for the Olympics.

Hop Over Some Afternoon

Two of last seaso_n’s undefeat-
ed performers, Mike Levine and
Bill Manko have continued to win
with ease. Manko takes care of the
150 yard back stroke, while long-

_ winded Levine hasn’t been press-

ed in _the 440 yard free style
event.
Other capable lettermen on the
. crack“ Grady array include: Cap-
tain Walt Johnson, Paul Brug-
ger, Don Wilde, Bill Cochran,
Harry Lucas, and Bill Grant.
So leg it over to the YMHA
(Across from Heinz Chapel on
Belleﬁeld Street) tomorrow even-
ing at 8:15 and “Have yourself a
time.”
You’ll probably see Dick Cas-
siano, Ralph Mitterling, Doc Hart-

wig, and Charlie Gonguoff acting‘

as judges. Charles Ebert handles
the loud speaker, and Frank Car-
ver keeps everything moving a
a lively pace.

Points to Hold
Scoring Lead

Sammy David edged ahead of
Dodo Canterna in the torrid race
for individual scoring honors
among the Panther cagers as the
four leaders, David, Canterna,
Bill Cieply and Lou Cecconi fur-
ther improve on their totals of
last year.

David tallied 14 points in the
Allegheny fray Wednesday night,
while Canterno was held to 11.
David led last season’s point to-
tals with 177, while Canterna was
runnerup with 151.

Co-captain Bill Cieply and Bim-
bo Cecconi both have shown of-
fensive improvement over their
totals of the previous year, 100
and 55 points, respectively. Ciep-
ly’s set-shooting, particularly

against Bethany and Carnegie
Tech, is responsible for his in-

crease. The individual totals:

Debates

igning Pro Offer

By Max Scherb ,

Pitt’s passing fullback, Paul Rickards announced yester-
day that he will return to school for the spring term despite
oifers to join pro ranks. The Los Angeles Rams and the Cleve-
land Browns in the rival leagues claim him. '

The “VVheeling Whip” is in the pleasant predicament of

having to choose between offers
although not a letter winner last
fall. Rickards, a sophomore, is
eligible for the pro draft because
of war service.

He had great success with the
“T” at Pitt in 1944 when he led
the nation’s passers. However
with an Army hitch and a switch
ot the single wing, Paul had dif-
ficulty regaining his old form last
season.

Clark Shaughnessy, former Pitt
Coach and now a Los Angeles
mentor, wants Rickards badly.
Shaughnessy believes Rickards
could burn up the pro loop if giv-
en an opportunity.

The Cleveland Brown’s shrewd
mentor, Paul Brown, who is noted

as a judge of material has also,

evidenced a strong

Rickards.

Rickards was never allowed to
realize his full potentialities at
Pitt. There has been no evidence
on the part of the coaching staff
that this situation will be cor-
rected.
