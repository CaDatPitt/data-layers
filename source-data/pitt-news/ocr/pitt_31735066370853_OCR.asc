Militants declare war against Farrakhan, Pitt

By Dan Bates
News Editor

A militant Jewish group from New
York City, calling itself the Jewish
Defense Organization, claims it is
declaring war on Nation of Islam leader
Rev. Louis Farrakhan and those
responsible for his upcoming visit to
Pitt on Nov. 14.

Although the B’nai B’rith Hillel, a
Jewish organization on campus, op-
poses violence in this situation, JDO
leader Mordechai Levy said those who
are responsible for inviting Farrakhan
to Pitt will be “dealt with "according-
1y’?!

“These people are enemies of the

Jewish people, so they will be visited
and taught a lesson in Jewish justice,’ ’
Levy continued. ‘ ‘We will do whatever
it takes to inform them that they have
made a very bad move. We are declar-
ing war.”

Levy said his group will rally at Pitt
on the day of Farrakhan’s speaking

engagement to encourage Jews to
“have guts and stand .up for
themselves.” His ultimate goal, he
said, is to stop Farrakhan from speak-
ing around the country against Jews.

“Farrakhan is obviously a devil to
Jews and to other people all over

, America,” said Levy, “and we intend

Joan Mondale encourages increases

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer

Joan Mondale, the wife of former
Vice President Walter Mondale, cited
wage discrimination as one of the big-
gest challenges facing women today.

‘iPay equity is one of the biggest bat-
tles facing women,” Mondale said. “It
is one of the most fundamental
economic issues of our time. The
gender gap in wages of American
workers has not been narrowed, and it

Women on Women Lecture Series at
Carlow College Thursday night. She

spoke to an estimated crowd of 150
people, who were mostly female.
Although there is a discrepancy in
pay between women and-men, Mon-
dale expressed much optimism in the
future of women in the United States.
“Women are everywhere and can do
anything," she said. “And I expect our
role in politics to increase steadily.”
Mondale noted the choice of a
woman for her husband in the last
presidential election as a sample of
things to come. “I was thrilled when

if a woman is in the presidency during
our lifetime."

However, before that is to nappen,
she said, the women who are elected
to office must change their views: “I
am disappointed with some of the
women in politics. An example would
be [Supreme Court Justice] Sandra Day
O'Connor. She is a very shrewd
woman, yet she votes as conservative
as_a man would vote. We need women
in politics who think like women.

“We need to elect more women to
the Senate before thinking about the
presidency,” she continued. “The

Members of the JDO will be carry-
ing ﬁrearms at the rally, Levy warned.
He said that if members of his group
are attacked, they will defend
themselves. “They're messing with the
wrong people,” said Levy. “If
anything should happen, there will not
be a shout-out, but rather a shoot-out.
Oh, and don’t be surprised if you see
some heads roll.” _

He added that Pitt’s administration
would be held “physically responsi-
ble” for any harm that might come to
JDO members. “If there is a crisis,”
he said, “we know who to pay back. ”

University of New York in Albany last
spring, the JDO reportedly intimidated

Faculty members" of the college of
Arts and Sciences will. consider a pro-
posal to eliminate the “no entry” part

of the credit/no entry grading option at t

a meeting on Thursday. The change is
part of a proposal by deans Elizabeth
Baranger and Irwin Schulrnan to
simplify the grading system.

Currently, each school can select one
or more of five options along with the
letter grade option. The current options
are S/U (satisfactory/unsatisfac-
tory),S/NE (satisfactory/no entry),
H/S/U (honors/S/U), and H/Q/U
(honors/qualiﬁed/unsatisfactory). The
new system would reduce the options
to honors/satisfactory/unsatisfactory
(I-I/S/U) and passednot graded (P/X).

The X grade has caused some con-
troversy. “We feel that this [the X
grade] is not advantageous to the
students on campus, especially in
respect to taking classes that they nor-
mally wouldn’t take,” said Luke
Kluchko, president of the Student
Government Board. This problem
would occur because students are afraid
‘the X grade would look like a failing
grade on their transcripts.

in political

be patient, though. The changes can’t

be made overnight.”

Mondale, the daughter of a
Presbyterian minister, was raised in
Columbus, Ohio and Wallingford, Pa.
She graduated from" MacAlester Col-
lege in St. Paul, Minn. with a degree
inhistory andminorsinartandFrench.
After graduating, Mondale worked for
the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and
later for the Minneapolis Institute of
Arts. Since then she has been an ac-
tive supporter of the arts.

After marrying Walter Mondale in
1955, she continued her commitment

many students during a rally condemn-
ing both Farrakhan and his supporters.
According to Heidi Gralla, editor-in-
chief of the university's student
newspaper, JDO members shouted
“death to Farrakhan” and distributed
leaﬂets which warned that all those
who supported Farrakhan would be
destroyed. ‘ ‘It looked like a major riot
would occur, and it scared a lot of peo-
ple,” Gralla said.

The militant JDO was established on
the West Coast in March 1982 by Levy
and others who felt that Jews were
under extreme attack around the coun-
try. In January 1985, Levy established
a headquarters in his native New York

City. Presently, there are an estimated .

SGB opposes proposal
to cut ‘no-entry’ option

In the grading system the changeslare y
being considered as part of the conver"- '
sion to a computerized student infor-"

mation system the university is current-
ly installing. The credit/no entry
system ‘would cost additional money
because of the cost of removing a
course from a student’s transcript.
However, “I think cost/beneﬁt-wise,
it is worth having it there.” Kluchko

said. “I think it-is beneficial for the 

system to be able to . accomodate
credit/no entry status.”

Kluchko said that the student govern-.

ment board is planning to send a letter
to the faculty this week regarding the
subject. He also said he thinks students
can also participate by asking pro-

fessors to attend the meeting on Thurs- -

day and vote against the proposal.‘
“In an issue like this,” Kluchko
said, ‘ ‘all they [the students] have to do
is walk up to the professor, ask them
to attend the meeting and vote “no.”

willing to oppose this proposal.

“I think this is something that
students need to realize is affecting

take the time. That’s all.”

Typhoon Dot hits Philippines, China ~

Typhoon Dot is heading toward the
southern Chinese coast after
devastating parts of the Philippines and
killing more than 50 people.

The stonn was about 300 miles off
Hong Kong, and ofﬁcials warned peo-
ple in hillside shanty towns to take
cover. The main Philippine island of
Luzon was devastated yesterday by
125-mile-per-hour winds. More than
200,000 people were forced to ﬂee,
and thousands of buildings were
destroyed. The government said
damage estimates are in the millions of
dollars. In Nueva Ecija Province, of-
ﬁcials estimate 70 percent of a bumper
rice crop may be destroyed. Winds
devastated an estimated 500,000 acres

of cropland.

State House votes
to keep sports teams

(HARRISBURG, Pa.) — Yesterday,
the State House of Representatives ap-
proved legislation designed to keep the
professional sporting teams of Pitts-
burgh and Philadelphia from being
moved to other cities.

The House voted 169 to 26 to OK
the measure. The bill now moves to the
Senate.

Under the legislation, a Pittsburgh or

Philadelphia team could be relocated

only if the franchise was losing money
and had poor attendance at its games.
If an owner plarmed to move a team,
he or she would have to offer the fran-
chise for sale at fair market value to
anyone willing to keep the organization
in its current location.

The bill would create a three-
member arbitration board to make rul-
ings relating to the legislation.

Others fought hand-to-hand with baton-

were arrested, and about 53 ofﬁcers
were injured.

“Baby Jesus”
doll hits store racks

A new Christmas gift will hit the
racks in stores this year: a 13-inch doll
of the baby Jesus.

Rita Edler, founder of Heavenly
Dolls, Inc. said she believes there’s.
never been anything like it. The doH,
in white, hispanic and black models,
comes wrapped in a blue blanket and
carries a card saying, “My name is
Jesus. Jesus loves you. I am your
friend. Please love me.”

It’s also got a non-toxic, glow-in-the-
dark, plastic halo which snaps onto the
baby’s head. The doll comes complete
with a wooden manger and the artiﬁcial
hay inside. Like the halo, it's safe for
kids.

Edler said she and her husband
searched for a long time ‘until they

found the right artist for the doll’s -

angelic expression. She said anyone
who is a Christian ought to want one.

Rabbi Joseph Levine, executive

organizations have thus far not planned
any demonstrations or rallies to protest
Farrakhan. Levine said his group will
merely respect the freedom of the
Black Action Society to invite Far-
rakhan to speak at Pitt. -
Levy is very critical of the local
Jewish groups for not organizing any
rallies or demonstrations. He said those
who are not willing to “go out into the
streets to stand up for Jews are worth-
less and meaningless. Their own

_. weakness is paving a road to another
road to Auschwitz.”

He added that those Jewish groups
which “refuse to take a stan ” are giv-
ing Farrakhan his power.

In response to the threats of violence,
Black Action Society member Rashid
Soundiata said the BAS will not cancel
Farrakhan’s visit. “The bottom line is
that Farrakhan is coming,” Soundiata

. said. “We will not be intimidated by

anyone. Those days are over.”
Student activities director Andrew
Smith said there is little serious con-
cern about the threats of violence. He
said he has received phone calls from

' Levy and the JDO which “alluded to

the fact that there may be violence,”
but he was more concerned with pro-
tecting freedom of speech. The threats
are not inherently dangerous to the
students, he said.

thoughout the country, speaking out in
support of the arts. However, today she

sees art in a state of decline in the
United States.

‘ ‘Art is suffering from a lack of sup-
port in general,” she said. “The basis
of support for the arts has always been
the individual. Lately the individual has
not given enough support to art, but
I'm sure the situation will improve
soon.”

Mondale said that despite her interest
in politics and her  in the
failures of her husband, she would not
run for office herself but encouraged

,_/'

other women to be active in politics.

‘ ‘Despite the frustrations of the past
and the slow progress of today,” she
said, “women_mustn’t be disheartened.
As the doors of opportunity open
wider, we must choose between many
alternatives and mustn’t be afraid to
take chances ”

She also warned against the loss of

‘femininity. “We must learn to walk the

delicate path of balancing opportunities
without losing sight of feminine
values,” she said. “We must gain the
new freedoms available to us and still
keep the qualities of femininity that
make us women.”

Farrakhan Dilemma

It is admirable and just that university policy
protects freedom of speech in all forms on cam-
pus. Students should not  arbitrarily pro-
tect ” from particular beliefs or viewpoints
solely because they may be controversial, un-
conventional or unorthodox. Certainly umver-
sity policy should do all it can to promote an
atmosphere in which the free exchange of ideas
can ﬂourish. T

It is, however, regrettable that money com-
ing from the student activities fund should be
offered to aman guilty of shameless racism and
anti-Semitism. Thanks to the Allocations Com-
mittee of the Student Government Board which
is ﬁnancing the event and the Black Action
Society which is sponsoring it, the Black Muslim
minister, Louis Farrakhan, will receive $3,500
for speaking here at the University of Pittsburgh
next month. _ _

We must question the appropriateness of this
invitation. It is particularly insensitive of the

- -Black Action Society — an organization which

has been justly vocal and active in promoting
the protection of human rights in South Africa
— to sponsor the Farrakhan speech, as the
minister has ruthlessly and se1f—righteous1y lob-
bied for the systematic oppression of the Jewish
faith.

We feel that, while the university should en-
courage and promote visiting speakers of all
political and philosophical persuasions, student
funds should not be used in support of people
or groups determined to launch political crusades
in whatever form they may appear. Let these
speakers prove their dedication by lecturing free
of charge.

Can’t Get a Date

Dear Bob ‘Travers,

Jeez, Bob, maybe you could settle a
bet that a bunch of us have. We were
trying to determine just exactly what
traumatic occurrence befell you
Homecoming Week. We’ve narrowed
it down to ﬁve things:

1) Your girlfriend didn't win because

.she was rude and surly all week.

2) One of the Homecoming can-
didates laughed in your face when you
asked her for a date.

3) Your write-in campaign for king
tallied only one vote.

4) You had to pay to go to the Pitt
game. '

5) Nobody ever buys you a beer.

Whatever it is, Bob, we hope you
feel better soon. Next year, maybe you
should take a vacation somewhere dur-
ing Homecoming. That way maybe
you’d get more write-in votes.

Misspending Funds

This letter is about the ways the Stu-
dent Government Board is misspending
both my and other students’ $24 ac-
tivities fee. Lately the SGB has been
having trouble deciding whether Robert
Clary of the Simon Wiesenthal Center
should be paid for a future speaking
engagement because he might donate
some of that money to the center.

I would hate to see the SGB
allocating our money directly to chari-
ty, but that is not the case here. In this
case, the check would be written out

to Robert Clary for his speech, which '

will probably deal with the Holocaust
and the people who were responsible
for that tragic moment in history. Why
are the students on the SGB employ-
ing a technicality to prevent Clary from
speaking about this topic?

My theory with regard to this mat-
ter is that the event would not allow the
SGB to continue spending our money
for their childish endeavors. After all,
they paid Ruth Westheirner to talk
about throwing onion rings on protru-
sions, even though they can hear her

‘on theradio every Sunday. I guess the
SGB doesn’t have a radio. They gave
away $1,059 to four students so they
could attend a three day National Chris-
tian Students Conference in Chicago.
Gosh, I hope the champagne won't in-
ﬂict them with hiccups. I could go on
mentioning the other frivolities and
boring speakers the SGB wastes our

money on, but why bother?

At least they can have the decency
to present us with a few more infor-
mative speakers like Clary. Yet as long
as people like—Mike Ryan, D0_.u.dS and.

., - . .. '.- _n _._-/_.V_._ W. . .

Lettes to the

Karen Frost on the SGB refuse to fund
Clary, we will be denied this privilege.
I just hope these SGB members realize
that students are dissatisﬁed with their
actions, and that they will change their
positions.

Right to Hunt

This letter is in response to Jennifer
Orr’s letter in the Oct. 11 issue of The
Pitt News. She talks about hunters be-
ing a small group, but the truth is, there
are over one million deer hunters .in
Pennsylvania alone.

You were right about us being a
vocal group, Miss Orr. We are sick and
tired of people like you badmoutliing
hunting with no facts to back up your
claims. It is the anti-hunters like you
who are trying to “dupe” the public
with false statements.

Miss Orr, who obviously must be an
authority" on the subject of game
management, states that ‘much of the
money that hunters pay in fees actual-
ly goes to produce a deer overpopula-
tion. ’ ’ The truth is that the majority of
the money goes toward acquiring land
from private land owners which pro-
vides suitable wildlife habitat and
which may be in danger of being
removed or just thoughtlessly
destroyed. Money also goes toward
educating new hunters to be safe
hunters.

If there were no hunters, then come
winter there would be too many deer
to live on the limited food supply that
was not supplemented by the Game
Commission. Many deer would starve,
and starvation _is a slow, cruel death.
The deer that do survive would not be
as healthy. Miss Orr states that tons of
hay are put out every winter. This is
not true because deer cannot digest hay
in the winter, and the other foodstuffs
that are put out are only used during
severe weather and are for all animals.

She states that if there were no
hunters, the deer would stop their over-
population by changes in the female
heat cycle and survival of the ﬁttest.
What are these “changes”? Arethey
going to use birth control? The state-
ment about survival of the ﬁttest is
already true. The smartest, fastest and
ﬁttest deer are able to survive and are
able to pass these traits on to the next
generation. ‘ 

Deer also cause problems for apple
orchards, corn farmers and family
gardens. Farmers are sometimes forced
to kill deer because of_ heavy losses. If
there were no hunters, the number of
deer killed on roads and highways
would skyrocket. At least hunters put
thedeer to good  -   ~

Editor    

That last statement of yours, Miss

Orr, about being a herbivore was very
slick. You seem to have all the bases

fcovered. But even if it's true, most anti-

hunters are not as extreme in the
lengths they will go to argue their
point. Most will sit around the table this
Thanksgiving and eat a turkey that was
fed until it couldn't, eat anymore to
plump it up so the mighty consumer
could have the best.

Gracious Hosts

On Saturday, Oct. 5, we visited your
city to see our Carolina Gamecocks
play your Pittsburgh Panthers. While,
sadly, we were stewed, we feel it only
appropriate to let you know of the
quality of Pittsburgh people.

The degree of excellence portrayed.

by your friendly city of Pittsburgh has
achieved far more than we can ade-
quately describe. Never have we been
in a stadium surrounded by as friendly
and helpful individuals as we
encountered.

The degree of excellence’didn’t stop
there. We found everyone in your city
to be of unusually high quality. We
would be amiss not to mention two
lovely persons we met while there,
Dianne Evangelist and Paul Kraisinger.
They graciously and patiently toured us
around your ﬁne city, and we, along
with them, ended our Saturday night
with some mighty ﬁne food at the Top
of the Triangle.

To. this, let us add our personal
thanks and best regards to all your peo-
ple, players and fans.

An Open Letter To Dr. Peikoff

Dr. Peikoff:

Yesterday I received the most in-
teresting piece of “junk” mail to reach
me in quite some time: a request for
a donation to your organization, The
Ayn Rand Institute, so that you may
spread her “objectivist” philosophy.

According to your brochure and let-
ter, objectivism is the only philosophy
that teaches that “reality is objective,
reason is man's only source of
knowledge, man is an end in himself,”
that capitalism is the economic system
best suited to freedom, and the govem-
ment’s "sole function is to protect in-
dividual rights. Well, it isn't; long
before I read any of Ayn Rand’s books,
I found these ideas in the works of
many diverse writers ranging from
Milton Friedman to Robert Heinlein.

I was also puzzled to read, “objec-
tivismisopposedto  libertarianism.”
First, many libertarians subscribe to
objectivism’s essential tenets — or is
it the other way around?" Libertarianism
is much older then objectivism, and
many ideas found in 19th-century liber-

. tarian and utilitarian works have made

their way into Ayn Rand’s writings.
Moreover, objectivists have been
writing for and advertising in liber-
tarian magazines for as long as I’ve
been reading Reason. Quite frankly, an
objectivist who opposes libertarianism
makes as much sense as a Protestant
who opposes Christianity.

Most libertarians I know (myself in-
cluded) do not subscribe to anarchism
or nihilism — so why does your
brochure say we do? This also strikes
me as odd because many of Ayn

DARAN MANAGEMENT

Rand’s ideas can be traced to the Rus-
sian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. These
ideas include: 1) belief in reason; 2)
atheism; 3) rejection of Marx’s “dic-
tatorship of the proletariat, ’ ’ Hegelian
dialectics and non-voluntary charity;
and 4) a call for a worldwide general
strike — the theme of her best-known
novel, “Atlas Shrugged”!

I would also like you to compare the
economic system of John Galt’s
“Atlantic” in “Atlas Shrugged”with
anarcho-syndicalism; though not iden-
tical, they are quite similar. Moreover,
Bakunin’s inﬂuence on Ayn Rand ex-
plains why her “rational, constructive”
heroes spend a good deal of time com-
mitting robbery and sabotage.

Before‘ you simply dismiss my thesis,
remember that Ayn Rand was from
Russia, was interested in political
writings (and eager for anti-Marxist
“intellectual ammunition”) and had ac-
cess to Bakunin’s works; her criticisms
of anarchism reveal a firsthand
familiarity with anarchist writings.
Moreover, the parallel ideas between
Ayn Rand and Mikhail Bakunin are too

numerous to be coincidental.

Finally, let us not forget that her
favorite character in Victor Hugo's
“Ninety-Three” was not the pro-
tagonist himself but his anarchist
friend. (Why Ayn Rand never
acknowledged her debt to Russian
anarchism—' ortoBritish utilitarianism
and American libertarianism — is in-
deed a mystery. Since you, Dr.
Peikoff, are her legal and “intellec-
tual” heir, perhaps you could explain
it.)

But here’s the oddest thing of all: In
order to spread the anti-altruistic ob-
jectivist philosophy to high schools,
colleges and universities, you ask me
to disregard its tenets and perform the
self-sacriﬁcial act of making a dona-
tion! And what would you do with my
money? You would: a) slander liber-
tarians; b) tell people that Ayn Rand
had a monopoly on truth (though not
in so many words, of course) and that
objectivism is unique (It isn’t!); and c)
in the name of promoting “in-
dividualism,” you would create a
generation of humorless, dogmatic
young people who will have no opinion
on any subject until they read what
either you or Ayn Rand have to -say
about it.

I hate to have to tell you this, Dr.
Peikoff, but I'm not that kind of
libertarian!

How anyone capable of writing a
book as excellent as “The Ominous
Parallels” could make such howling
blunders is beyond me. Perhaps you
should reread it, taking your own ad-
vice and reconsidering the dubious
wisdom of starting a mass movement
of true believers. ,

For The Pitt News

The years from 1975-1985 are
recognized by the United Nations as the
Decade for Women. The 1985 con-
ference held in July in Nairobi, Kenya,
attracted 14,000 delegates from 157
countries, including Brenda(Berrian, an
associate professor in the Department
of Black Studies at Pitt.

Berrian was part of a 36-member
delegation sent to represent the U.S. in-
terests at what is seen as one of the
most inﬂuential conferences ever held
for women’s rights. “It’s not just
talk,” she said. Fourteen first ladies
and a greater number of foreign
ministers attended the conference
which had direct ties with many
governments.
was to increase educational, employ-
ment and political rights for women
throughout the world. The ultimate
goal is to create equality and peace in
the world by the year 2000.

Each area of the world recognized
the need to ﬁght the feminization of
poverty, but each had speciﬁc needs to
be addressed before equality could be
viewed as a reality. The United States
and western European nations
stressed equal pay for men and women
performing the same jobs. Asian coun-

tries denounced the scarcity of
economic opportunities available to
women. The African delegations ex-
arnined the inequalities present in food
production (i. e. , women do most of the
work and have the least show for it).
Latin American representatives ad-
dressed urban growth and development
which often leaves many women liv-
ing below the poverty level. All of the
countries agreed, however, that women
worldwide need to develop their talents
both intellectually and artistically to
quality for opportunities for

advancement. _ _
The other goal of the Nairobi con-

ference was to promote world peace
through disarmament, abolishing apart-

heid and recognizing Palestinian rights.

' “Reaching agreements was difﬁcult

because we were fighting cultural
restraints,” Berrian said. However, the
difficulties were overcome, and
agreements were reached and included
in the document entitled Forward
Looking Strategies for the Advance-
ment of Women Until the Year 2000.

The four major ideals the document
expresses are that all forms of
discrimination be abolished, economic
redistribution be implemented to fight
extreme levels of poverty and homeless
Palestinian women be provided with
living accommodations. The document
is non-binding and will be sent to the
United Nations for approval.

Correction:

La Donna Bates did not work with Nobel Prize winner Dr. Roger
Sperry, as reported in ‘ ‘ ‘Left-brain’ people dominate the world’ ’,
which ran in the Oct. 11 issue of The Pitt News.

Woods named
Player of Week

Pitt defensive end Tony Woods
has been named ECAC Defensive
Player of the Week. This is the sec-
ond consecutive week that a Pitt
player has received the award.
Woods, a junior from Newark,
N.J., had nine tackles against
Rutgers on Saturday, ﬁve of which
were unassisted. Woods now has
67 tackles on the season, second on
the Pitt defense to only Steve Apke
who leads with 87 tackles. Woods
also has 6.5 sacks and an in-
terception on the year. ‘
Last week, fellow defensive end
Bill Sapio received the same award
for his efforts against North
Carolina State.

" The Pitt News ‘- ‘October’ '21 ,‘ I985
Flaherty says Pirates
may be gone by 1990

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

The recent sale of the Pittsburgh
Pirates to members of the public and
private sector may only prolong the im-
minent move of the franchise to another
city. That, according to Allegheny
County Commissioner Pete Flaherty,
depends on whether the people of the
greater Pittsburgh area will support the
team far better than they have the past
few seasons.

“We are really only buying ﬁve
more years of time,” said Flaherty on
Tuesday. “If the Pirates don’t make it
in ﬁve.years, you can expect the fran-
chise to be sold to another city.”

This all stems from the Oct. 2 an-
nouncement that the Galbreath family
had ﬁnally sold the ﬁnancially unsuc-
cessful Pittsburgh franchise to a coali-
tion headed by Pittsburgh Mayor
Richard Caliguiri and Malcolm Prine,
chairman of Ryan Homes. Flaherty
was the only county commissioner to
support the coalition.

His reasons are clear. “I had hoped
that the county would come to the aid
of the city in keeping the Pirates in
Pittsurgh,” Flaherty said. “We have
a $35 million structure in Three Rivers
‘Stadium. I would hate to see it only get
used eight times a year for Steeler
home games.” The Pirates use Three
Rivers Stadium approximately 80 times
every year.

Flaherty cited fan support, or the

' lack of it, as beingthe only drawback

of the Pirate franchise. Heisoptomistic
that the franchise will turn around
economically.

“They haven’t always been a
failure,” Flaherty noted. “I don’t look

upon the Pirates as a failure. I look

’ upon it as being a down period.”

Flaherty added, “I think they have
eliminated a lot of the problem players.
A lot of the big salaries are gone. There
is a transition taking place over there.’ ’

The former Pittsburgh mayor is
quick to point out, ‘ ‘We don’t have the
market that Los Angeles or New York
has.’ ’ But neither Los Angeles nor
New York has been given a black eye
-by a cocaine scandal. Still, Flaherty
does not believe the drug trials played
that big of a role in the lack of fan
support. .

“I really don’t think that was a ma-
jor factor,” Flaherty said. “The atten-
dance has turned sour on the Pirates.”

There will have to be a deﬁnite
change in the next ﬁve years if the
Pirates are going to stay. '

‘ ‘The Pirates have to turn around at
the gate,” Flaherty explained. “If they
don’t, the people in the private sector
[of the coalition that bought the Pirates}
are going to get out.’ ’ If that happens,
the city will be forced to sell the ball
club.

Bucs’ search for manager may
bring about some big surprises

. .th.°.  

Bobby Smouse
Staff Writer

Last week the Pittsburgh Pirates ﬁred
Chuck Tanner, their ﬁeld manager of
nine seasons. That was the easy part.
Now they must ﬁnd a man to replace
him. Tanner demanded to be general
manager and axing him was not near-
ly as difﬁcult as replacing him will be.

Forget, if you will, that Tanner led
his team to two consecutive last-place
ﬁnishes their past two seasons in the
Eastern Division. And forget that this
season, his team secured for itself the
less than proud distinction of being

_baseball’s worst.

These dreadful seasons cannot be
solely attributed to Tanner’s managing
ability. In fact, it was not Tanner’s poor
managing which led to the Pirates’
downfall, but a reﬂectionof the inep-
titude of the people he was forced to
lead. . .

Let us not forget that it was Harding
Peterson, the former general manager
of the Pirates, not Tanner, who made
player personnel decisions. It was
Peterson who forced us to watch
players such as Rod Scurry, Dale
Berra, Doug Frobel and George Hen-
drick destroy the Pirate wimting tradi-
tion, not Tarmer. Tanner was simply
a victim of circumstance.

Of those candidates for the job who
have major league managing ex-
perience, Joe Altobelli, Yogi Berra,
Billy Martin, Frank Robinson, Joe
Torre, Bill Virdon, and Dick Williams
appear to be the most viable.

, Altobelli is a fortner Manager of the
Year, and as recent as 1983 led the
Baltimore Orioles to a world
championship.

1 Berra could possibly be a big box of-
ﬁce draw, but it is questionable
whether Pirate fans would welcome-

another Berra in Pittsburgh.

Robinson, like Altobelli, is a former
Manager of the Year, and is a proven
leader but has been criticized for not

achilles heal which at times has
renereed her ineffective. Freshmen set-
ter Dianne Zerby has a briken ﬁnger
by she managed to serve for some
crucial points during the Georgetown

match. Freshmen outside hitter Denise .

Frawley has stress fractures in both of
her feet which is holding her back.

Collier however was quick to point
out that it has been the Lady Panthers’
lack of intensity during practice rather
than the injuries that have contributed
to their disappearance from the national
rankings.

“Losing the Penn State match was
a direct result of some poor practices
throughout the season,” said Collier.
“We were talented enough to be the
number one team in the East but our
practices have not been intense
enough.”

Pitt will be the number one seed in
the Big East toumament at the end of
November. Providence, the host team,

will be seeded second followed by 0

Georgetown. The Lady Panthers shut
out both teams over the weekend, but

' Collier knows that the toumament will

not be as easy.
‘ ‘My fear is that since we didn't lose
a game to Providence and Georgetown,
‘ both teams will go home and work even
harder to prepare for us in the touma-
ment,” he said. “I’m worried that my
team will take it for granted that we will
beat them again. Hopefully we will res-

pond by practicing with more intensi- _

ty, but so far we have not.”

The Lady Panthers will travel to Du-
quesne on Tuesday after which their
schedule turns difﬁcult. Pitt will face
four nationally ranked teams in
November, including Tennessee,
Texas A&M, Illinois State and Purdue.
Their goals at the begining of the
season were to win the Big East and
to ﬁnish in the top 16 nationally. The
Panthers must defeat some of the na-
tionally ranked teams in order to ob-
tain their goals.

Collier will have a stern eye on the
intensity level that his players display
during practice from now to the rest of

being able to relate to today’s ball
player.

Torre is presently under contract
with the Atlanta Braves, ironically the
team which snatched up Tanner last
week, but would most likely be able to
sign with the Pirates with permission
from the Braves’ owner, Ted Turner.
Torre is also a proven leader, and
might have the perfect tempennent to
manage the young Pirates.

Virdon, a former manager of the
Astros, had problems relating to his
players. He may be just a bit too much
of a disciplinarian to lead a young
teatn.

Both Williams and Martin are cur-
rently under obligation to teams, the
Padres and Yankees respectively, and
may prove to be untouchable. Both
men have expressed a desire to be
relieved of their present duties, so they
can’t be ruled out just yet.

If none of the above men are chosen,
the Pirates may hire a manager who has
no previous major league experience.
Ifthis turns out to be the case then look
for Hank Aaron, Cal Ripken Sr., Joe

Morgan and Willie Stargell to be given
a close look.

Of these four, Aaron and Ripkin
have the most experience to prepare
them for a managing position.

Ripken has been working for the .

Baltimore Orioles for as long as there
have been Baltimore Orioles, if not
longer, and is more than ready to step
into a managing position.

Aaron has been working in the
Atlanta Braves front ofﬁce since his
playing retirement, and has spent a
good deal of his time working in player
development. He, too, may be ready
to take over a major league team.

Although Joe Morgan is lacking of
actual managing experience, he has ex-
pressed an interest in the position, and
in light of his leadership ability during
his playing days, he could be the
perfect motivator for the Pirate team.

Which brings us to the sentimental
choice _for Pirate manager, Willie
Stargell. Stargell has very little ex-

A perience in coaching andmay need a

few more years under his belt before
he steps into a managing position.

Soccer team beats Ho

as record improves to 10-1-1

The Pitt soccer team has picked
up a habit this season, and it is one
they do not want to break. That
habit has been winning as the Pan-
thers once again came out on top
this weekend, defeating the
Georgetown Hoyas 3-0.

The Panthers, who now have an
impressive 9-1-1 record, took an
early 1-0 lead as junior Bob
Howard scored for the Panthers on
an assist by senior Vic Hugo.

In the second half, the offense
was sparked by the play of junior
Mike Grimes as he scored two
goals, the ﬁist on an assist by Hugo
and the second on an assist by
freshman Erim Gude. “The ball
bounced right,” said Grimes. “It
was just luck. It was a good day.”

While Grimes might have down-
played his contributions, he had
high words for his teammates.

“The defense played great,”
Grimes stated. “Just as long as the
defense keeps playing good, we can
play with anybody. That's the key
to it — defense.”

The defense was indeed a key to
the Panther’s, victory. Led by
seniors Brian Casey and Uzoma
Chibundu and sophomores Craig

Freund and Dan Liberati, the
defense shut down the Hoya’s at-
tack. Goalie Dave Torrence blocked
nine shots on goal en route to
recording his eighth shutout of the
season. The defense has played
tough all year, allowing opponents

to score only ﬁve goals in 11 A

games.

“The defense played well, as
always,’ ’said head coach Joe Lux-
bacher. “Guys who came off the
bench on defense, like Seckin
Ablak, played really well. We were
very pleased. Georgetown was a
good team, but wehad achance to
put it in, and they didn’t. We
capitalized on our chances.”

Things do not get any easier for
the Panthers, as they travel to Penn
State on Tuesday for a battle with

an always tough Nittany Lions team ' '

and then host St. John’s on Satur-
day in another Big East match-up.

“Penn State is very hard to beat
at home,” Luxbacher said. “It is
going to be a tough game. Right
now we have to concentrate on

-Pennstateandnotlookaheadatst.

John’s. We have to take each game
as it comes.”

but he wound up completing eight
of 21 attempts for 103 yards on the
afternoon. The tenderness of his
ankle showed up on a few passes
that were underthrown. He and
tailback Charles Gladman again
carried much of the load for the of-
fense. Gladman gained 96 yards on
23 carries, while fullback Tom
Brown added an impressive 70
yards on 12 carries.

Congerni, Gladrnan and Brown
each accounted for one of Pitt's ﬁrst
three scores. Gladman opened the
scoring with a two-yard run, Brown
added a one-yard nm, and Congemi
scored on a six-yard bootleg.

Pitt closed the scoring late in the
fourth quarter when New Jersey
native John Cummings hit redshirt
freshman Mark Stanton in the end-
zone for a 29-yard scoring strike.

“You have to be satisﬁed with
the victory,” said Fazio. “We did
some things nice, but there were
also some things we didn't do too
well. We'll work on those in prac-
tice this week.”

A few things he will not have
donated much time to this week are
rushing defense and rushing of-
fense. Once again the defense did
not allow much on the ground.
Rutgers gained 49 yards on 32
rushing attempts, while Pitt
gained 243 yards on 58 attempts.
' Some things the Panthers will

The Pitt News -' October 21; 1985

work on are the punting game (Bill
Rudison averaged only 32 yards per
punt) and staying away from
penalties (the Panthers were
panalized 11 times for 110 yards).
Getting the kinks ironed out will
be another step in keeping roasted
duck off the menu for Pitt’s post-
game meals.
Panther Patter: Congemi made the
play ofthe game early in the second
half. On first and 10 at the Rutgers
41-yard line, Pitt ran a reverse to
Chuck Scales. Congemi handed
off, then came back and laid a block
on Rutgers defensive tackle Harry
Swayne. It was the kind of block
that offensive linemen dream about.
“It was a great block,’ ’ said Fazio.
“It was the best play he made all
day.” It was Congerni’s ﬁrst pan-
cakeoftheyear  Lewis’ intercep-
tion overshadowed another solid
performance by left comerback
Teryl Austin. Austin had a ﬁrst-half
interception and was again solid on
punt returns  Pitt lost starting
center Barry Pettyjohn for the rest
of the season with an injury to his
right knee. He may require surgery
 Also injured in the game were
tailbacks Brian Davis (bruised
quad) and Zeke Gadson (separated

Shields (ankle), starting split end

Chuck Scales scored a touchdown
on a 26-yard run the ﬁrst time he
ever touched the ball in his college
career against West Virginia two
years ago. They will remember
Brian Davis breaking off a
touchdown run in the ﬁrst series of
downs he ever played in against
Boston College. Well, add another
name to that list. Pitt receiver Mark
Stanton scored the ﬁrst time he
touched the ball in his college
career when he caught a 29-yard
