t is no wonder, then, that Navy Day has real signiﬁcance

V: This is 1943-—a year that will go down in Naval history
ecause of the great job the Navy men are doing in the Atlan-

Pittpourri’s bit toward further-
ing Army morale produced results
when we printed Ginnie Volkay’s
telephone number. She got results,
and how, at the Kappa party for
the Air Cadets and AST Saturday
night. Incidentally, «none of the
Kappas have to worry _about dates
for the next few weeks.

The football team has lost quite
a few men to the Army and Navy
recently,,and they almost lost an-
other at_Annapolis last week. No,
not to the Navy, but to a Virginia
co-ed by marriage. Warren Hume
was ready and willing when he
went there last ‘week with ‘the B
squad, but the “lucky girl had to be
disappointed because of a Maryland
state law. . . ‘
‘ Paul Massey is sure of at least
one fan» to cheer him on—Shirley
J ennings, freshman in the College,
who was at the station seeing him
off to the Illinois game. It has pro-
gressed to an exchange of pictures
and all that, and it took little more
than a week.

Among those pinned over the
weekend were Nellie Lauth to Delt

1 Frank Carenbauer; and P,CW’s Joan

Harms now has Jack Davis’ pin. -

Lt. Chuck Cusick and Ruth Cox,
former co-ed, took the fatal step
Wednesday morning at Sacred
Heart church. They are now Lt. and
Mrs. And according to a mistaken
rumor, Ginny Sullivan received
some a. well . meant congratulations,
as a few bright souls mistook Chuck
Cusick for Bob Cusick.

The dashing, debonaire Air Cadet,
Allan Ilowit can’t afford to be put
in the guard house Weekends—he
has too much to ‘do-—somewhere.

Who ever -turned out the lights
at .the P_iKA. dance .a_t...We,bst,e_r__I;Iall
last Saturday seems to have .a vote
of thanks from atleast Dotty Kline
and Abbie Steinkirchner, Frank
Marmarose and Jean Bischoff, and
Dotty Blon and Dave Edgar. _

Marie Secan now sports former
Ohio State TKE _Bob- Hennesy’s pin.

PITT NEWS will go military
November, 5.

Three thousand servicemen,
will receive the November 5 is-
sue,,of the News instead of the
News Letter ordinarily sent to‘
Pitt's former students. The Men’s
Council has cooperated with the
Pitt News to ﬁnance this pro-
gram.

Students with information
concerning any ‘former Pitt serv-
ice man or woman are asked to’
submit their cotributions to ‘the

_ From the many letters and com-

_‘ open letter which appeared in the

"_‘;l:.he 1944 Owl, itseems that opinion
deﬁnitely favors publication.

 

  

 One of the letters received came
from a Private assigned to the
ASTP unit at the University. This
_. Private, 1943 editor of the City
3; College of New York’s Year Book,
‘voices in his letter a feeling felt by”
*most everyone here: “When the

éiple axiom of year book production
4 that as large a per cent as ever of
1 the ‘undergraduates will subscribe,
i: come wind, sand; and stars, blood,
cl sweat, and tears, and even war.”
"This is the opinion of a soldier dur-
-king war and is'typical, as well, of
civilians who feel as he, that a year
book is more essential than ever
.”before with the large number of
‘students requesting positions on the

"share the opinion of this private

From North and South,‘ East and
West, from the Atlantic and the
Pacific, the letters still keep pour-
ing into Dean Biddle’s office from
former Pitt students who are
anxious to keep in touch ‘with their
Alma Mater.

While playing in an orchestra for
a USO affair in Seattle, Washing-

It’s military reports and corres-

trying to teach the little women
G.I.’s at the Adjutant General’s
Army Administration School in Na-

“The coolest man in the outfit”-
that’s what they call Lt. Thomas L.
Smith who was completely “unboth—

By the way, “Unrutfled’." Smith

Since he has been made watch
oﬂicer of a mineloading plant at

Lt. Joe Kristufek is still playing

 Paooucnon THREAD GRINDING

By HERMAN FELDMAN

Realizing that serious problems
will demand solution at the conclu-
sion of this war, Pitt. News is in-
augurating a series of articles-on
post-war economic and political
problems.

As students, we will not change the
course of history, but we should be
interested in the post-war world as
we are the much-talked of “future
generation” that will shape much of
the future.

Intelligent solutions require
knowledge of the facts, and since
professors are among those who
know the facts, we will ask their
opinions. '

Economic post war problems
seem to fall into two overlapping
divisions: (1) What _will happen
in the weeks and months immedi-
ately after the Axis surrenders?;
(2) What are the pitfalls and ob-
jectives of the “Brave New
»World,” and the “Century of the
Common Man”? Dr. Marion Mc-
Kay, professor of Economic will
initiate the series by discussing
some probable patterns. '

“When the ‘war ends,” he said, “It
will be“ desirable to retain ‘certain
governmental controls such as ra-
tioning and price control.” Visions
of steaks, shoes, and happy buying
sprees appeared and vanished at

this remark. “Without rationing

there will be a wild scramble to- get
scarce. goods, and the result-will be
inﬂation. It will‘ obviously take
many months to rouse our peace
economy from its warti/me hiberna-
tion.” , '

‘‘‘Though it may be verydistaste.-.

the ‘duration’' ends,”_ he continued,
“Iti appears to be necessary. The
great danger of this ,period is that
‘bondholders’ will cash in their war
bonds too soon and ‘put too much

fmoney "into "circulation. Morover,.
tax reductions and eliminations.

will need to be made gradually.” .

' It is Dr. McKay’s belief that the
government’s present ’ program will
determine the degree of diﬂiculty in
solving economic problems after the

. war. A successful wartime program

will be blended most easily-into the
postwar situation. _, A '

But these problems, assuming
. that we act with reasonable san-

Men’s Council, “the official voice

A new and most important page
is now being written in Pitt history,
as the preponderance of khaki in
the Cathedral corridors may well
indicate.

The AST is proud to be taking

~ a part in this vital wartime chap-

ter. We hope that this column,

which will hereafter appear week-

ly in the Pitt News, will result in

even closer ties between the Uni-
versity and the AST.

To date,'ar1ny life at Pitt has
been most interesting; hence, there
should be an abundance oftnews
forthcoming from the unit. If any
‘of you have any suggestions con-
cerning this column, don’t hesitate
to submit them to your company

be welcomed.

Memories of basic training in the.

hot and dusty Texas‘ desert-were
brought back to many AST men,
recently, with the innovation of the
bugle call for reveille. '

One of the boys in 5th Platoon,
Co. Eistarted the week off on a sour
note when the bugler began to blast
out his “good morning” message.
Dazed by his sudden ‘awakening,
the Co. E protege reached for one
of his shoes and hurled it at his
tormen-tor. nThe .. bugler casually
picked up the footwear and dropped
it out of the nearest window.

hear almost every hour of the
day. It's only the AST boys exer-
cising their vocal cords on their
way to class.

“Beer Barrel Polka” and “Wait
’Till the Sun Shines, Nellie” seem
to be the most popular marching
songs at present. However, it is
probable that “I’ve Got No-
pence” will be in contention a
couple of weeks after payday.

Our vote for the best rendition
of the past week goes to the 5th
Platoon, Co. E for its heart-rend-
ing version of “Pistol Packin’
Mama.”

Russian students of Co. H were
treated to a bit of native Slavic
atmosphere last week when they
attended the United Nations Red
Feather Night review at Syria
Mosque.

The boys had an entire section
to themselves, and the audience
gave them quite a hand after a
most impressive introduction by the
‘master of ceremonies. C A

Althoughthe entire program was
excellent, the most popular person-
ality ,_ with the soldiers was Mrs.
Rose Bazilevitch, instructor in Rus-
sian, who appeared on the stage

with» the costumed Russian repre- .

sentatives.

A Fleeting thought: Why not have
the AST men scale the walls of the
Cathedral as a test of physical sta-
mina? The pace would be killing,
but who can deny that it would be
a most effective FINAL’ examina-
tion. ' '

who exemplify Benevolence and

their careers.

Modern women then make their
appearance and form a V. They will
be dressed in outﬁtsbeﬁitting the
type of modern life each represents.
The position at the point of the V
will be taken by the studnet, Caro-
lyn Miller, Ed.44, who ties together
the ideals and ambitions of the
women of today and carries on the
traditions of America’s way of liv-
ing down from the past. Behind her
on either side will be the Woman
in the Home, portrayed by Bertha
Yochim, C44; Woman in Industry,
by Pauline GuZanick,C45; Commun-

modern genuine sacriﬁce there will
be a WAC and a WAVE from the

. i The coaching report is submitted free of charge this week
on the Carnegie Tech-Lehigh game which occupied the Sta-
dium while our own Panthers were at Illinois. ‘

 V Impression No. 1 was (and this should prove a complete
 " .’ ._ surprise to nobody) that the Panthers will not have too much
 trouble subduing the game and willing but sadly inept Tar-
»_ tans, unless, of course, the Techites are hiding something. In
 this case, however, they -would be guilty of the neatest piece
I ,of deception since Thurston the Magician sawed the lady in
j _ half and put her together again and should dginitely turn to
gimagic instead of football. x v
- _. -No better summary of the game could be made than that
V ‘ provided by the score itself. It was nothing to nothing and
. merely proved the mathematical premise that nothing times
 nothing equals ditto. Neither team was good enough to‘ take
" » advantage of the considerable lapses of the other. The tackling
could generally be likened to miniature wrestling matches, and
Fwhen the ball carrier went down, it was more because he
‘ tripped on his own interference, than because of any efforts
-' I put forth by the opposition. ' i ’ , . ‘
. The action was so bad that the handful of Tech rooters
2' - that might loosely be referred to as “the crowd” stood up-and
cheered on those occasions late in the fourth quarter when
Lehigh "threatened the goal line. It was not a case of treason
or lack of school spirit. It was sheer relief. at seeing someone
do something.  7 «
 It is doubtful whether either side had much fun play-
- .; ing Saturday. For both sides were too conscious of the fact
that they had to make a game out of it. The steady rain pre-

   
   

c the thing that would look. best in the scorebook. They played
the dull, but comparatively, safe, defensive football.
 Yet, when it is all over, Carnegie. Tech should certainly
win an “E” for excellence for‘ carrying _on. .“We probably
haven’t any business out there,” Tech Publicity Director Max
Hannum admitted after the game. -“Only 34, turned out for
if-‘;. _ football, and 22 of those had never before played. But we put
'   it up to the boys, and they all said they wanted toplay.”
V Tech, like Pitt, is not playing football for the scores and,

 

 Hannum summed it up pretty well when he said,‘ “It’s better
~ than quitting." v

The subject of “quitting” brings to mind the Panthers

who are reported to have put on second half ﬁnish at Illinois
,that almost reduced Frank Merrivale and the Rover Boys to
the status of washed out has-beens. In a somewhat hectic
fourth quarter, the Pitts rushed across three touchdowns to
come within 9 points of victory. It wasn’t quite enough to win
the game, but it was enough to install them as favorites over

 

Bethany. We'll take the Panthers by 14 point

All of which indicates either (1)
they don’t have quite what they
were supposed to, or, (2) never
having had anything‘, they did not
know what to do with it when they
got it.

However, the Panthers can be
sure of one thing, and that is that
no more of the “T” formation will
be thrown back at them. For, al-
though the Bisons start_from a
balanced line “T,” they shift into
the conventional old Notre Dame

‘He’s the man everybody loves,
especially our Aviation personnel,
who have long proved that an army
dashes to mail call even faster than
to “chow.”
iFor Mail Sergeant Eli Gibber-
man, who is" connected with the
Headquarters Squadron, handles all
the Air Force‘ mail——alone. Before
his entrance into the Air Corps,
Sergeant Gibberman lived in Brook-
lyn where he worked as a jewelry
salesman, which is ratherfar re-
moved from his work at Pitt.
After the mail is sorted by squad-
rons, the Sergeant inspects each in-
,'dividual piece of ‘mail before it goes-
to the men. A
All sorts of packages ﬁnd their
way’ to the postoﬁice ‘from the boys’
homes. Most of them contain food,

but a few’ are shirts and socks from

thoughtful mgthers and wives.
gowever, the bulk of the mail is

‘from all parts of the globe.

letters; letters from girls, families,
and friends serving overseas.

Several of the men have already

returned from ﬁghting engagements »

abroad, and mail comes to them

Sgt. Gibberman says that every-
thing from lipstick to" cute sayings‘
can be found on the letters. ‘One
such saying “To the sweetest cadet «
in the world” was exposed ﬁrst to
the eyes of the sergeant and then
to those of that “sweetest cadet.”
Nicknames are the Sergeant’s worst
headache, since he has to discover
that ‘-‘Bob” is really someone with
an entirely diﬁ’erent name. And,‘
too, he must remember names of
those who have left Pitt, for mail
continues to arrive weeks later.

Sgt. Gibberman expects a rush of
packages and letters before and
during the Christmas holidays. So

the mail room is entirely..pr.epared.. Q

He expects from ﬁfty to sixty bags
of mail that week. ‘

 

‘ Lutheran Students’ Association,

Tri-School Hike
Slated iiy LSA

led by Rev. John P. Stump, Pitt
Chaplain, will hike to Panther Hol-
low on Sunday, October 31, for a
weiner roast followed by a discus-
sion of “The Role of the Student in
Facing the Peace.”

Students and service men, par-
ticularly those of Lutheran faith,
are invited to meet with the present
members in front of Carnegie Li-
brary’s park entrance. From there
the representatives of Pitt, Tech.
and P.C.W. plan on hiking to the
Hollow.

“The purpose of these monthly
metings,” says Rev. ‘Stump, “is to
maintain contact between service
men and students'*a.nd the churches
of their faith.” Rev. Stump seeks
to keep this Contact through the
guidance of outstanding local
clergymen and also through partici-
pation in the discussions. In this

way he feels that the future spir-
itual and business leaders of our
world will carry their Christian
theory and thinking into practice.
If any student should desire a
private conference with Rev.
Stump, he’ is in his office at 2004,
Cathedral, from 10:30 to 12200
o'clock every Tuesday morning.

Considerable interest has been
expressed in a Men’s Glee Club,

‘who remain in school and new
students who‘ enjoy this type of
activity. An organization meet-
ingwill take place on Monday at
4:30 o’clock in 151 Cathedral. Mr.

Glee'Club, will discuss with pros-
pective members ways and means
by" which a groupcan be formed
which will.be.a credit to the Uni-
versity. ‘ ‘ '
