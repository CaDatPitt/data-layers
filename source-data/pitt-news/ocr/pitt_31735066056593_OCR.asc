Leonard Jefferies, the con-
troversial professor from the
City College of New York,
spoke last night about the
importance of educating the
black youth as well as defend-
ing his position on Jews play-
ing a heavy role in slavery in
this country. .

He was the featured speaker
during Black Week at Pitt, a
week of events for the univer-
sity community, sponsored by
the Black Action Society.

Jefferies was on the Regents
Board Committee of New
York State during 1989 and
1990. This committee is
responsible for overseeing the
curriculums in all New York
state public schools.

He, along with other profes-
sors and teachers from various
regions across New York,
voted to change the curricu-
lum to become more multicul-
tural.

“The existing curriculum in
the state of New York was a
curriculum of white suprema-
cy and exclusion. Our goal
was to make that curriculum
one of inclusion,” Jefferies
said.

He was called an anti-Semite

because of the contents of a _

document addressed to the
committee and a speech that
followed it in Albany, New
York during the summer of
1990. ‘

During that speech Jefferies
contested that a “Jewish con-
spiracy, connected not by the-
ology but by race, was behind
the various colonial apparati
that were involved in the slave
trade.” ,

Jefferies backed up those
words last night. A

“There is nothing crazy or
anti-Semitic in this document.
It is just historical facts and
data.” ‘

He has also been criticized
for teaching anti—Semitic val-
ues at the City College of New
York where he has been the
chair of the black studies
department since 1972.

He defended his teachings
there also. “There is no record
of anti-Semitism anywhere in
the .25 years I’ve been at the
City College of New York.”

Two students at Pitt, sopho-
mores Jill Freeman and Mindy

'Eckstein, were in attendance

last night to see Jefferies in
person.

Jewish

students
rally for
awareness

By Cameron Harvey
Staff Writer '

It was the night the Nazis
attacked the most central part
of Jewish life —— the synagogue.
Kristallnacht was also the first
hint of what other horrors were
yet to come for the Jews.

Two Holocaust survivors
came to last night’s candlelight
vigil on the Bigelow Lawn to
tell of the suffering that the
Jews endured "during that night
55 years ago.

The vigil, sponsored by the
Jewish Community Relations
Council, was organized to try
to make the campus more
aware of theatrocities that
occurred to the Jews that night,
in hopes that something of this
magnitude can never occur
again.“That day synagogues
were burning all over Berlin,”
said Steve Meyer, one of the
Holocaust survivors. “The only
thing that kept me from being
arrested was that [while] the
Nazis were coming in the front
door where I was staying, I

University Democrats question 5 GB candidates them wvodavs

By Randy Knapick
Siam Writer ’

Several presidential and board candidates
for Student Government Board outlined

_their positions at last night’s University

Democrats meeting.

Concerned about the quality of student
health care, presidential candidate Tara
Munkatchy advocated a Student Health

iTask Force, which would find ways to

improve the Student Health Service.

Munkatchy said the task force would sur-
vey students to find their concerns about
the Student Health Service.

“I would like to see these problems
addressed, and then we can take them to
the university administration,” she said.

In addition, Munkatchy suggested a med-
ical information hot line to answer student’s
health questions.

This hot line, which Munkatchy called
“Medifact,” would be modeled after Pitt’s
general information hot line, Telefact.

Presidential candidate Douglas Herman
addressed the ‘criticism that SGB candidates
are basing their campaigns on generaliza-
tions instead of concrete facts about their
proposals. A

Herman, a _member of the Students
United for Responsible Government, dis-
missed this criticism, because the ticket’s
specific goals are listed in their campaign
literature and candidates are accessible to

He then added, “When I

D THE P1'rL_ NEWS, Wednesday, Eovember 1(L1993

By Steve Kozarovich
Asst. News Editor

A new home was provided for some
future Oakland residents yesterday
afternoon. It’s a spacious room located
on a ledge 500 feet in the air, and it has
gravel instead of carpet.

No, it’s not new university housing,
it’s a nesting site for peregrine falcons.

Officials from the Pennsylvania
Game Commission placed the 4—feet—
long-by-3—feet-wide nesting site on the
38th floor of the Cathedral of Learning
to provide a home for at least two pere-
grines that have been sighted recently
ﬂying near the Cathedral.

The site mimics many of the
peregrine nesting needs including
cliff—like conditions, gravel and an
adequate local prey source, ac-
cording to commission officer Dennis
Jones. ‘

“The overall sight is attractive to the
birds, and they have been seen here
before,” Lynn Leindecker, representa-
tive of the National Aviary in
Pittsburgh, said.

“They generally return to the area

where they were raised, but we can
possibly catch birds immigrating
through.”

“They have a history of taking over
man-made structures  they have
proven to be adaptable to man,” Jones
said.

Currently, there is one other nesting
site for the falcons in Pittsburgh. The
top of the Gulf Tower building down-
town has been a home for peregrines
for the last three years.

The Gulf site was built five years ago,
and falcons nested there the followin
spring, Jones said. '

According to Leindecker, the two
sites are far enough apart that there
shouldn’t be any competition between
them.

The Pennsylvania Game Commis-
sion and the National Aviary combined
efforts for the development of the
project. Now that the nest is installed,
it will be the responsibility of the
Game Commission, but National Aviary

personnel will tend and manage

the nest. Any young falcons living
in the nest will be tagged with leg

According to Marilyn
Maracle, co-chair of the board
of directors _for Pittsburgh’s
Gay and Lesbian Center, there
will soon be a meeting place
where gays, bisexuals and les-
bians can get together. I

Maracle spoke to members
of the Bisexual, Gay and
Lesbian Alliance about creat-
ing space for groups such as
BiGALA to meet at last nights
BiGALA meeting. “There are
over 100 bisexual, gay and les-
bian groups in the Pittsburgh
area. A lot of the groups are
very small and informal, but as

they expand, they’re trapped
because they don’t have the
money to rent space. "We [the
GLC] are looking to create at
least 4,000 feet of space.”
BiGALA member Chrissy
Koch said the GLC would be
important to BiGALA because
of its social beneﬁts. “The GLC
is important in the aspect that
we’re getting involved in a
community cent_er where
everybody can get together.”
Maracle said Pittsburgh gay
groups can become members
of the center by paying dues,
but thatevery group would be
able to send a representative.
“We have an advisory board
comprised of representatives

Plomsfor gay meeting space underway

from every gay organization
who want to send a member.
“Their function in the com-
munity is to take things out
into the community and give
input on what they feel the
center should be doing,”
Maracle said. BiGALA mem-
bers said they plan on sending
a representative to the center.

.They also plan on volunteer-

ing at the center, doing such
tasks as manning phones and
helping with a newsletter.

Other plans for members of
the center include mentoring
for youth, organizing social
dances and providing office
and storage space for mem-
bers.

UPMC sponsors study on
sun damage and wrinkles

By Jemlifer Vernet
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center is sponsoring a
study to examine the effects of
fruit acids and other chemical
peeling agents on the skin of
people with severe sun damage
and facial wrinkles.

Dr. James Bridenstine, direc-
tor of cosmetic dermatology and
chief investigator of the study,
said the goal of the study is to
devise a formula using the
chemical peeling agents.

“Our first objective is to see if
the agents work,” Bridenstine
said. “Then we will devise a for-

mula to use the agents safely
and effectively.”

Some of the acids used in the
study are already found in low
concentrations in over—the—
counter skin moisturizers and
creams.

Two chief agents will be used
in the study — glycolic acid and
pyruvic acid. Glycolic acid is a
natural substance derived from
sugar cane. Pyruvic acid, on the
other hand, is not a f1uit—related
chemical. "

Bridenstine said pyruvic acid .

SEAC rallies in DC. against ll’/727

By Scott Carpel

Iior The Pitt News

One year ago on Nov. 6, Al
Gore was elected vice president

‘of the United States and

promised to help stop the incin-
eration of toxic waste.

Environmental activists gath-
ered at Lafayette Park in front of
the White House Saturday to
remind the vice president of that
promise.

The promise by Gore, accord-
ing to Olivia Kissel, a member of
the Student Environmental
Activist Coalition, was to shut
down the Waste Technologies
Industries plant, a waste inciner-
ator located in East Liverpool,
Ohio, until further research was
conducted.

“We made our presence
known [on Saturdayl,” said
Kissel. “So Al Gore couldn’t
ignore the fact that he [had] bold
face lied to us [one year ago.]”

Students from Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Maryland and Michigan gath-

_ Environmental

ered to hear speakers from the
Protection
Agency and other concerned
activists inform others about
WTI.

WTI is currently one of the
world’s largest toxic waste incin-
erators and is located 36 miles
east of Pittsburgh. It was erected
on the banks of the Ohio River
and just 100 yards from an ele-
mentary school.

According to SEAC, this incin-
erator burns 176,000 tons of liq-
uid organic hazardous waste
and discharges 83,000 tons of
inorganic hazardous waste per
year.“This site has been proven
without a doubt to be bad,” said
Kissel.

The W'II protest was one of a 1

small number of protest groups
congregating on Lafayette Park
Saturday, but SEAC members
who attended the rally said this
protest overshadowed every-
thing else. ‘
Alonzo Spencer, a local envi-
ronmental activist who spoke at
the rally, reminded listeners that

WTI is illegal, unsafe, unneeded
and unwanted.

SEAC member Josh Knauer
also spoke about how students
are seldom heard and how now
they are finally getting recogni-
tion, according to Tzufit Ram, an
SEAC member.

Other activists informed peo-
ple about other incinerators
around the country, in particular
in Florida and Nebraska.

“I felt like I gained a lot from it
[the rallyl,” said Ram.

Members of the rally joined
together and signed a big poster
board which they apparently
gave to secret service men en
route to the vice president. The
poster had information about
the current incineration prob-
lem.With the poster, individuals
returned copies of Gore’s book

entitled Earth In The Balance in »

which Gore wrote that the prob-
lem with waste is that we are
throwing our waste into other
people’s yards, according to
Ram, which is similar to what is
happening in East Liverpool;

CGS campaigns for
annual blood drive

 

5938 Baum Boulevard
Pittsburgh, PA 15206

Call for more information

By Lisa DiMeno
For Ibe Pitt News

Members of the College of
General Studies Student
Government Council are
campaigning for the entire
campus community to con-
tribute to the CGS blood
drive Thursday.

“We want to do twice as
well as last year,” council
member Thurston Winbush
said.

The CGS—sponsored blood
donation event is part of the
1993 Pitt/Penn State Blood
Challenge and will take
place from 3 p.m. to 9
p.m. in the Forbes Quad
Galleria. The evening hours

i were es ablished to accom-
modate\the schedules of
CGS students, faculty and
staff.

Winbush said council is
targeting more than the CGS
-community to donate blood.
“We want to involve all Pitt
employees, faculty, students
and visiting international
students,” he said.

The last blood drive spon-
sored by CGS took place in
July and was determined to
be very successful, accord-
ing to council president

Mary Anna Smith.

“The blood bank desper-
ately needs the blood, so
anyone who can contribute,
should contribute,” Smith
said. -

Winbush said the blood-
donating process takes less
than an hour and refresh-
ments will be served after-
ward.

In other news, Council is
currently involved in the
search for a new College of
General Studies Dean to
replace Dr. John O. Bolvin,
who is retiring. Council is
planning a retirement recep-
tion for Bolvin that will take
place Thursday, Nov. 11,
from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. in the
lower lounge of the William
Pitt Union.

Council is also working
on:

“If anybody wants detail, give
us a call,” he said.

“We will answer the callland
we will discuss anything with
you.”

“Students need constant atten-
tion, not holiday churchgoers,”
he said.

Herman said the “open
forums” currently held to famil-
iarize students with the candi-
dates should be specialized
to cover only one topic per
forum.

_“The reason no one turns, out
[at open forums] is because
you’ve got three radicals over
here and three radicals over
there and all they do is shout at
each other the whole time,” he
said. .

Herman cited poor communi-
cation as a problem within stu-
dent government.

' “Poor communication is a
problem here and we have a
plan to address it,” he said.
“Herman said SURG would ini-
tiate a “reformation of govern-
ment,” by exercising the power
of the president to coordinate
board members and giving each
board member a specific “sphere
of inﬂuence.” ‘
‘Students could then address
their concerns to to the board
member who handles a speciﬁc
area of concern. ' A

“The problem with ' SBG right
now is that there are too many
inefficiencies,” he said.

Presidential candidate Tony
Moody said SGB does not need
radical reform.

“I am not the candidate for

change,” he said.

Moody noted eight other __uni-
versities have modeled their stu_-
dent governments after Pitt’s. " 4‘

Moody also said he supports
the city’s proposed anti-loitering
legislation.

Ross Pasquale, an SGB presi-
dential candidate, said he would
establish an “outreach program”
as one of his first orders of busi-
ness.

Under this program, SBG
members would go to student
organizational meetings, fraterni-
ties, sororities and residence
halls to make the SGB more
accessible to students.

Pasquale also advocated an
SGB service project, in which the
board selects a charity and holds
a number of fund-raisers
throughout the year for that
charity. SBG would then donate
the money raised at the end of
the term.

Pasquale responded to asser-
tions that he unfairly selected
members to Omicron Delta
Kappa, the national service fra-
ternity of which he is president.

“I think the allegations stem
from somebody trying to create
something that isn’t there, so
they can have something on
me,” he said.

Members are admitted to the
fraternity by a democratic vote of
five fraternity leaders.

Some of the candidates for
whom Pasquale voted did‘ not
gain admission to the fraternity,
and he sees that as “proof of a
lack of nepotism in the organiza-
tion.” ‘

SGB presidential candidate
Joseph Foner worked for the
computerized survey system
which will begin next Monday in
all Pitt computer labs,

The survey can be used by
administration, faculty and stu-
dents “to get the pulse of the stu-
dents on a certain issue,” he said.

Foner said he advocates selling
advertisements on the side of Pitt
shuttles, provided they would
not violate the contract between
Pitts ‘ Department ’ V of
Transponation and Parking and
Lenzner Tours, the company
who operates Pitt’s shuttles.

Department of Transportation
and Parking, Foner said.

Foner suggested the extra rev-
enue could be used to provide
24-hour Van Call or reduce the
student safety fee, currently $30.

Because expansion of the
Choice Dollars Program is
expensive, Poner said the
student discount program,
now adopted by over
Oakland businesses, should be
expanded.

Several SGB candidates also
spoke at last night’s meeting.

Dave Deluliis, a member of the
SURG ticket, proposed a com-
munity service course, in which
students could work to improve
the community for academic
credit.

“I really don’t think this univer-
sity gives students incentive
to serve the community,” he
said.

Deluliis said most students do
not have the time to volunteer,
but offering credit would
increase the number of students
who would help out in the com-
munity.

25'

“I think you will find that it
makes a difference,” he said.

Though Pitt is a diverse cam-
pus, Eric McKinley said minori-
ties do not take an active role in
university affairs.

r “We need to change the uni-
versity to a working diversity,”
he said.

McKinley said he is “very con-
cerned about creating an
African-American cultural cen-
ter,” as well as a. coalition
between the university’s African-
American organizations.

Deena Buchanan decided to
run for SGB in response to
“increasing levels of apathy and
miscommunication.” -

As an employee of the Office
of Admissions and Financial Aid,
Buchanan said she sees opportu-
nities to make the office more
student—friendly, including “an
easy ABC way” to fill out ﬁnan-
cial aid forms. A

In_addition, Buchanan suggest-
ed compiling a booklet which
includes information concerning
applications for financial aid,
important deadlines and other

student questions COITIITH

  Jefferies

Continued from page 1

“To be honest, I am here because he is
extremely "anti-Semitic,” said Freeman.

Jefferies said that his students have not com-
plained about him being anti-Semitic.

“None of the people who called me anti-
Semitic were in my class, including the many
Jewish ones. Instead, according to Jefferies,
“All the people who called me anti-Semitic
were not students in my class, like [New York
State Governor Mario] Cuomo, [Attorney
General Robert] Abrams and [former New
York City Mayor Ed] Koch.” _

Koch and Jefferies had many battles while
Koch was ‘in office. According to Jefferies, the
mayor pleaded with him to come to his office
and discuss some quotes in The New York
Times.’

Jefferies said he was hesitant to go, but
eventuallyhe did.

“Mayor Koch was trying to mess with my
mind so I wanted the privilege of messing
with his mind,” he said.  .

He tried to focus on reeducating the youth
of black society during his speech.

Michelle Campbell, a member of BAS,
opened the program dealing with that issue.

‘ “We have been miseducated and misguided,

but we are the future and our children are the
future.” . . I ' ‘
Jefferies began his speech following

Campbell’s remarks, saying, “We must march
into the 21st century with distinction, strength
and diversity. There is a serious movement
to close down the minds of African and
Latin-American youngsters and instill fear in
you.”

Jefferies said the only way to get past this is
to “forget about the behind and get involved
in your black mind.” 1

He called for blacks at Pitt and schools

across the nation to get together and study.

their heritage and history.

That is why Roberta Burton attended the
lecture, because “Dr. Jefferies is involved with
history and social awareness,” she said. ,

Jefferies was also critical of two black enter-
tainment stars, Michael Jackson and Whoopi

Goldberg. Jefferies was-disappointed in ’

Jackson for not holding on to his black her—
itage.

“All Michael Jackson knows about Africa is

Tarzan,” said Jefferies, referring to the singer’s
light skincomplexion.
. He also spoke about Whoopi Goldberg and
her involvement with Ted Danson. “We can-
not have people manifesting the Whoopi
Goldberg syndrome.” _ -

Jefferies was very strong about the. reaso
for anti-black sentiments, “The reason why we
are being attacked is that what we are doing is
devastingly against white supremacy.” I

Liberate don 't alienate
_ Last night, Dr. Leonard Jefferies spoke at the William
Pitt Union as part of the Black Action Society’s “Black
Week.” Dr. Jefferies, a professor at the City University
of New York, has been accused of anti-Semitism and of
promoting black supremacy. Dr. Jefferies denies all of
these charges. Yet aside from his denial, he did not dis-
prove charges of anti-Semitism.

Despite his claim that “this is not about anti-Semitism,
it is about anti-kemitism” (kem being the region around
the Nile River Valley), remarks like “the Jews are trying

to destroy black knowledge,” point to prejudice. In -

addition, he blames a “Jewish—controlled” Hollywood
for portraying blacks" negatively and says that no civil
rights alliances with Jews will help.

Jefferies did point out that he was ‘president of a
Jewish fraternity in college, but didn’t David Duke say
some of his best friends were black?

Dr. Jefferies said all philosophy, science and art came
from Africa, but gave credit to advances made after the
height of African civilization. He asked how
Hippocrates*could be called the father of medicine
when he f‘worshipped” Imhotep. Regardless of who
was the first to begin to systemize medicine, , the fact
remains that each individual made a contribution, not
as a group member, but as a separate thinker. Arguing
over who was the first father of medicine doesn’t ‘help
doctors deal with the problems of disease and injury
today. ‘ P

In presenting his views, Dr. Jefferies focused on catch
phrases and emotional rhetoric in spite of encouraging
the audience to think critically. When talking about the
Holocaust, someone in the back of the auditorium
began to shout that a high Nazi, official was Jewish. To
his credit, Dr. Jefferies wanted to prevent “ugly inci-
dents,” by-returning to his slogans such as “paralysis of
analysis.” _ , -

He told his audience “don’t get mad, get glad,” and
warned them the agendas of other races for the 21st
century had no place for blacks except to_ exploit them.
However, he did say he wanted _to have whites in the
audience, so that they could learn._ ' 

; Dr. Jefferies said blacks must unite so that they can
move into the 21st'century' and teach the rest of the
world how to live together.’ f
._According to Dr. Jefferies, because whites couldn’t
accept that Africahslhad built the pyramids, they all
subscribe to the View presented in Erich Von Daniken’s
Chariots of the Go__ds?, which said the pyramids were
built with the help of aliens. _ ~
Dr. Jefferies seems to want the races to view each
other as aliens. He wants the races to unite within
themselves, but not'_with each ‘other. We "must look past
the divisive rhetoric" of ,“liber,ators” like'Jefferies and
begin to understand one "another as members of the
human race. A

SGB, just as important as Homecoming  

_, I know what you’re thinking.
The elections for Student
Government Board are just
around the corner. And even
though they aren’t nearly as
important as those for
Homecoming king and queen,
they tend to be equally if not
more superficial. So let’s take a
gander at these elections.

This year’s elections will be

the first competitive ones since
I came to Pitt sometime in the
1980’s. There are actually a
plethora of candidates running
for both’ president and board
members. Why the sudden
interest in the SGB after so
many years of the well—docu-
mented Pitt apathy? Well, per-
haps it’s because the outgoing
hoard raised such a controver-
sy through their wel1-publi-
cized actions, including many
questions regarding the use of
funds from the student activi-
ties fees. I like that theory, so
let’s go with it. P
, "As reported in The Pitt News,
during a recent SGB meeting,
in response to the number of
candidates, SGB President
Jacob Brody said, “Students are
realizing that student govern-
ment works, and in the past
couple of years the presidents
and the boards have shown
that things can be done.” I
think maybe you missed the
barn, Mr. Brody.
_‘ As a result of all the candi-
dates, We’re left with an elec-
tion that might not be decided
purely on the basis of populari-
ty and/orthe lack of candi-
dates running. In the past the
latter just about guaranteed
anyone who tossed their hat
into the ring a position and
along with it ﬁscal and bureau-
cratic authority and responsibil-
ity. Now that’s comforting.

So for the position of one
president this year there are six
candidates, including three
from last year’s board. For
eight possible board member
slots, there are an almost
inconceivable 14 candidates.
One of the outgoing board’s

which has been reported in the
newspaper, is the forthcoming
erection of a gazebo/bandstand
and a four-sided clock on the
WPU lawn. The reason? As
President Jacob said, “Pitt is
between two of the lousiest
streets in Pittsburgh, so we’re
trying to create a more relaxed
atmosphere. We need some
landmarks.” You know, he’s
right. A gazebo and a clock
will sure make me feel more

David W.
Matta

relaxed. As I always say, give
me a good landmark, and 1711
show you a relaxed guy;

About the clock, Brody said,
“It will enhance the appear-
ance of the union and will help
students get to class on time.”
Well, thank God there’s a prac-
tical purpose for this clock. I
was afraid it was just a way for
Brody to leave his mark on the
university. The price tag for
these landmarks is an approxi-
mate $60,000 that is supposed
to be shared by Pitt and the
SGB miscellaneous fund
intended for physical irnprove—
ment projects. The decision to
spend this vast amounl of
money on such campus beauti-
ﬁcation projects was made dur-
ing a summer SGB meeting.

Since it was the summer, not
all of the board members were
able to attend, so all eight of
the board members gave
President Jacob their proxy
vote. So who made the deci-
sion to spend this $60,000? You

‘ guessed it; President Jacob.

Who is responsible for his abil-
ity to render such a decision?
The eight members who turned

over, their votes to him. All

nine '0 members of SGB, should
be held accountable, and three
of them are running for SGB
president. In case you didn’t
know, the tuition of the SGB

" ';:'-.':\  ‘:"..':"’,-'_';:.';T" .2  ':'.":',:'   :."..'::V."“.7

dent activities fees, in addition .~

to a stipend of approximately
$100 per month. The other
eight members are paid a
stipend of approximately $70

per month, also out of the stu- 3 '

dent activities fees.

So, you ask, oh wise and;
opinionated Dave, how are we ‘

to decide for whom to cast our
almighty votes in this year’s
elections? It’s simple. You go to
events where you can hear and
ask questions of the candi-
dates; you read the news sto-
ries covering the campaign;
you talk to people, to learn as

much as you can about the

candidates and you vote intelli-
gently, not blindly. As I’ve said,
it’s likely that many of the can-

didates running this year are ‘

doing so because of'disap—
pointment with the outgoing
board. So these people are
immediately worthy of consid-
eration because their hearts are
probably in the right place.

It’s kind of like a microcosm ,

of the federal election in 1992
where change was the_b_uzz-
word. The status quo and busi-
ness as usual were not‘ good
enough. Just because ajc:andi—
date comes from a "successful
fraternity doesn't .mea'n"that
he’s got what it takes to be '_a
good SGB_ member. _ l 3

So everyone out there within
100 miles of this ‘column
should go and vote on
Wednesday,   
when you do, vote  
heart. I know more than‘ a" few
of you out there still have one
despite what going to school
here may have done to prevent
the usage of that organ. The
vote is anonymous. You are
not obligated to vote for your
friends or for your friends’
friends.

Afterall, the only one who
will ultimately have to live with
your choices for the next year
is you. I can assure you that I’ll
be voting’ with my 'ful'ly-func-

tional heart. And I'm graduat- '0

ing in April. .

' At Midnight Madness, just before the
1993-94 Pitt men’s basketball team took
the floor, the women’s team had its
chance to run out into the spotlight and
cheering crowd. “[Last year] all
they did was introduce us,” Pitt women’s
basketball coach Kirk Bruce said. “We
didn’t play.”

This year, the Pitt women’s team got its
chance to play at Madness. The two
teams had intersquad scrirnmages inter-
spersed with one another.

“Everybody [at this yea_r’s Midnight
Madness] was a captive audience and
they saw us play,” Bruce said. “Maybe
now the interest will be there.”

The inclusion in Midnight Madness is
part of the push to improve fan interest in
-Pitt’s women’s basketball program, which
has had problems drawing fans.

“I was sitting at Madness thinking,
“What would stop a group of students
from coming up here and watching us?’
All they did [that night] was get on the
shuttles or walk up the hill. Why can’t
they do that for our games?” said Bruce.

Other changes in the marketing of the
women’s team are linkingthe schedule
cards of the men’s and women’s teams, as
well as offering season ticketpackages
including both teams.

The teams’ games on November 27, the
men against Youngstown St. and the
women against Duquesne, are being
packaged together.

“Why should we hype it any different
than the men’s team?” Bruce asked. “It’s
women’s Division—l basketball. It is the
Big East, one of the best leagues in the
country.

“Why can’t we get 2,000 people at the
game? No one can tell me why. To me,
the serious basketball fan should want to
see women’s Division-I basketball.”

Bruce's argument is that men and the
women play the same game." The differ-
ence is one is played above the rim, the

Jill Colabrese and the women's basketball team are hoping to gain some sup-

other is below.

“If you watch Eric Mobley dunk the
ball, you are going to ooh and ahh,”
Bruce said. “If you see Jonna [Huemrich]
make a move in the post, you are going

" to ooh and ahh.” _ r .
One reason that all of the non-revenue

sports at Pitt have lacked in attendance is
the City location. There are just too many
things to do, including sporting events.
“The Pittsburgh sports fan is very
knowledgeable,” Bruce said. “Sometimes

too knowledgeable. "They won’t give
[new] things a chance. There are so many
things to choose from. They don’t allow
something else to take over their interest.”

Bruce said having fans in the stands is
important for the players.

“It’s important because these girls work
hard,” Bruce said. “From our standpoint
[having a large crowd] makes you feel as
though you are appreciated. The men

downs cut it to 16-14 at the half. Final
score 24-16. This may be the biggest win

poised and can deal with adversity, an

in the past.

Pitt grapplers hope to follow in footsteps of predecessors

By Dan Lauso
Staff‘ Writer

Expectations are high at the Fitzgerald
Field House for the Pitt Panther
wrestling team.

The Panthers are anticipating another
solid season that has become the
wrestling team’s trademark over the past
eight seasons.

Consistency is the key word to

describe head coach Rande Stottlemyer’s
recent Panther wrestling teams.

“Seven out of the last eight years we’ve
finished between 13 and 30 in the
[national] rankings in tournament and
dual meets,” said Stottlemyer.

“We’ve also had an All—American
wrestler for seven out of the last eight
years.”

The 1993-94 Pitt wrestling team should
follow in the footsteps of the previous
nationally—ranked Panther teams.

“We’ve got a good mix of upperclass-
men and freshmen,” Stottlemyer said.

This year’s Pitt squad will be led by
returning All—American Jeff Kloiber, who
wrestles in the 190-pound division.

Kloiber, a senior, is ranked third in the
country in the preseason poll deter-
mined by the National Wrestling
Coaches Association.

Along with Kloiber, the nucleus of the
team will be made up of a group of
NCAA qualifiers from last season.

The load in the 126—pound division
will be carried by sophomore John
Richey. '

“Richey has the talent and credentials
needed to be an All-American,”
Stottlemyer said. ' '

Junior JJ. Fasnacht could come into
his own this season, wrestling in the 134-

Harriers lock second
goal of season in sights

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer

 This weekend the Pitt cross country team will attempt the second

part of its three-part goal for the season.

« Two weeks ago they accomplished their first goal by finishing in
thetop three in the nationally-ranked, Big East conference.
 Or_i”November 13th, the ‘.Panthers_will have a chanceto go for
their second goal —.—- finishing in the top four at the IC-4A‘ Cross

Country Championship. -

If Pitt does that, it will have a chance to obtain its third goal by
being 1 of only 22 teams to compete in NCAA Cross Country

Championships. *

The Panthers said they

at Leesburg, Virginia.

“l’m psyched up because I feel we have a decent shot to finish in
the top four,” Pitt senior Mike Lynne said. “It’s all going to come
down to what teams have the best races. I think this teamis capa-
ble of running one of its best races of the year.’f

Junior Frank Nesko said that in order for the Panthers to run one
of their best races of the year, everyone will have to run according

to their abilities.

Added to the mix this season will be
Pittsburgh-area native and Iowa transfer,
Rich Catalano in the 158-pound division.

The hardworking sophomore heavy-
weight Pat Wiltanger could step up and
become the anchor of the experienced
Panthers team.

“We think Pat has tremendous poten-
tial  he’s going to be really outstand-
ing,” Stottlemyer said.

The losses of big winners Stephen
Budman and Sean Gibbs will be tough to
compensate for.

The departures of Budman and Gibbs
could be offset by the emergence of
sophomore Brett Gould and a strong
class of freshmen coming in this year.

“Brett is close to reaching the next
level and becoming one of our top
wrestlers,” assistant coach Scott Hovan
said.

Pitt’s winning tradition should contin-
ue over the next four years with a strong
group of rookies they have coming in
this year.

Pitt’s recruiting class was ranked as the
17th best in the country by Center Mat,
“The Prep Wrestling Specialists,” as they
call -themselves. _ _

The Class of ‘97 will consist of Mark
Bodo, Chris Stevens, John Withrow, and
Larry Sprecher. All of Pitt’s fabulous
freshmen have experienced winning
during their high school careers. All the
rookies placed in their home states’
wrestling finals. Boda and Stevens also
placed highly in the freestyle junior
nationals.

The Panthers’ most experienced
wrestlers will come from the top four
heaviest weight classifications.

Pitt, PSU face off in different arena Saturday

The puck drops Saturday for the Panthers and Nittany Lions.

Staff Writer

The competitive fires that

exist between Pitt and Penn

State have made for one of the .

greatest rivalries in the college
ranks. Over the years, their epic
gridiron battles have been the
highlight of football seasons for
Panther and Lions fans alike.
But Penn State’s move to the
Big Ten has put a bit of a
damper on the age—old rivalry,
and 1993 marks the first time

‘ this century that the two will not

meet on the football field. So,
for the time being, the two
‘schools willhave, to ﬁnd some
other way to keep the competi-
tive juices ﬂowing.

- _And what better way to
accomplish that than with a fast-
paced, hard_—hittin’, bone-
crunchin’, rock ‘em sock ‘em
slugfest on your favorite frozen

surface? No, I’m not talkin“

about killer mutant kamikaze

ice ﬁshing, either. This is hock-
ey, ladies and gentlemen. Pitt
Panther style.

For the first time in the 1990’s,
the Panther Hockey Club will
add another chapter to the Pitt-
Penn State rivalry when they
face the Icers at Golden Mile Ice
Center in Murrysville Saturday
at 10:30 p.m.

This team is the second tier of
Penn State’s enormously suc-
cessful ice hockey program, and
was instituted to complement
their powerful tier one program
which is one of the best in the
country.

They have defeated several
NCAA powerhouses and began

this season as the number eight '

team in the nation. ,

The Icers", which began play
last season, consist mainly of
the top players in Penn State’s
strong intramural program, as
well as players from -the tier one
team. .

Saturday, they will clash with
a Panther team still trying to
find themselves.

Though they currently are 0-2
in division play, the Panthers
are an excellent team which has
been dealt a few bad scheduling
breaks. .

They dropped a back-and-
forth game to open the season
in maniacal Morgantown
against defending champion
WVU, then lost a similar game
to last year’s runner-up CMU,
While Still fatigued from playing
past 1 a.m. the previous night.

' Though they looked impres-
sive while trampling the Cal

Vulcans 14-0 on Halloween ,

night, and the CCAC Cougars 8-

3 last Saturday, they still have ,
yet to demonstrate the consis—'

tent play indicative of a champi-
onship contender. _
“I think that a lot of the prob~

V lem was that the team was still

very tired [against CMU], from
playing two straight games,”
Panther head coach Harold
Ochs said. “We had a couple of
[defensive] breakdowns

when [the Tartansl were on the

rush, [our defensemanl were
committing before their for-
wards were. We can’t let that
happen. ,

“Much of it is my fault,
though, because I wasn’t getting
the fresh units out there as fast
as I should’ve. The guys were
just too tired. If we would have
played [CMU] on Sunday, we
would have won.”

Despite the two bitter losses,
Panther captain Vic Disanti has
shined. He is among the league
leaders in points, topping the
Panthers with goals and assists.
His scoring touch and defensive

awareness will demand respect’

from the Icers. ,

The player to watch, howev-
er, will_be rookie center iceman
Bill Elliott, Pitt’s red-hot phe-
nom." ’ -

Since moving from winger to
center in the Panthers’ second
game of the season, Elliott has
been absolutely unstoppable.
After being held scoreless in his
first game, a 5-2 loss to WVU,
coach Ochs realized that Elliott
was not clicking as a winger on
the Panthers’ number one scor-
ing line. So, Ochs moved the
heralded rookie to center on
Pitt’s number two scoring line,
where he took off like a run-
away train.

He scored goals and added
assists in Pitt’s second game of
the year, and notched the first

‘ hat trick of his collegiate career

against CCAC. He» also assisted

‘on both of Pitt’s goals in their 5-

2 loss to CMU.

. “[Since the move], he is a new
man,” Ochs said of the former
junior Penguin. “And if I get a
couple of fast wingers on a line
with him, he will be even better.

The Panthers’ toughest

sports these days. In the recent
Nov. 8 issue of Sports
Illustrated, Rod Thorn, the
National Basketball

operations, differentiates
between trash talk and taunting.
He describes trash talk as
“harmless boasting,” and taunt-

white. ,
After the game Woodson con-

fronted Bengals’ head coach —

David Shula and reportedly
wagged his finger at Shula
while he was talking to him. He
then confronted Pickens, and
according to Bengals’ line-

ing as “the kind
of threatening or
_e_mbarrassing
talk that a player
could take
offense at.”

Brady A

nerback D.J.
Johnson told the

In the NBA,
where trash talk is most visible
and most easily heard and dealt
with by referees, taunting is
cause for a technical foul.

In the National Football
League, with 22 players on the
ﬁeld at a time and 120 yards of
playing surface, trash talk could
go on between a couple of
players throughout the course
of a game without the referees
noticing it.

It would be impossible for
NFL officials to consistently reg-
ulate trash talk, which is why
the NFL doesn’t have any rules
like the NBA regarding the ver-
bal sparring that goes on
between players. ' .

Which brings me to my point.
What the Bengals’ wide receiver
Carl Pickens said to Steelers’
cornerback Rod Woodson in
Sunday’s 24-16 Pittsburgh win
was just plain derogatory crap.
The Pittsburgh Post—Gazette
reported that two of Woodson’s
teammates said Pickens kept
yelling “Jungle Fever!” and
“Hey, you have Jungle Fever!” at
Woodson.

Pickens was referring to Spike
Lee’s ﬁlm jungle Fever in which
a white woman falls in love

Post—Gazette that racial taunting
in the NFL is rare, that he’s only
seen it two or three times in his
five-year career, and that the
top players don’t do it.
Woodson was quoted as say-
ing, “A lot of talk goes on in
football, but what was said
doesn’t goon very much.”

During the game, Woodson

held Pickens to two catches for
22 yards. Pickens came into the

game the number-nine A receiver-

in the AFC (31 catches, 411
yards). He may have made
the remarks out of frustration,
but like Johnson said, the top
players don’t use racial trash
talk.

And do you know why? They
don’t need to. Players like
Woodson let their playing do
the talking. Pickens is a bum.
Ancleven though he wasn’t
penalized for it on the field, the
NFL should investigate Pickens’
insensitivity and punish him for
it

Qnce you get them there, it’s up
to you to put out a good pack-
age. That’s something we can
do.”

Bruce said that the team is
getting improved support from
the athletic department, which
is a part of improving the situa-
tion.

“A lot of it is gender equity,”
Bruce said. “A lot it is they are

- trying to help the so-called non-

revenue sports in attendance.
That helps everybody.”

“That’s the way it should be.
Female athletes deserve to be

treated the same way as male ’

athletes,” said Bruce.

FAST BREAKS: Street and
Smit/3’s selected Huemrich as a
1993-94 preseason honorable
mention All-American. The
senior from Bethel Park, PA was
a first-team All-Big East selec-
tion last season.

“There is no better player in
the league than Jonna,” Bruce
said. “I know I’m biased
because I’m her coach  I

know basketball players and
she’s the best player in the
league.”

°One thing Huemrich will
rarelydo for the Panthers is play
center, which she has done in
the past. Bruce said that at this
point, center is the most open
position on the team. Senior
Carolyn Miller and six—foot-two-’
inch rookie Melissa Thompson

are prospects to replace Turia

Ransom at <_:enter.“Those two
are the ones that are really
standing out at the center spot.
Missy Dawson can play [power]
forward, too,” Bruce said. “For
us, the post positions are very
interchangeable.”

Bruce’s options in the middle
were limited with the loss of
six-foot junior forward Julie
Fornadel. She is out for the sea-
son with a knee injury. 9

“She’s somebody who is
always going to be there for
you,” Bruce said. “She’s a good
rebounder and a good inside
scorer. We always need people
like that, so that was a blow.”

Senior guard Erin Maloy

strained ligaments in her knee
during practice but is expected

_ to return to the lineup.

“Erin Maloy has a more work-
able injury than Julie,” Bruce
said. “We’re going to have her
back. Hopefully, we’re going to
have her before the start of the
regular season. She hasn’t prac-
ticed the last five or six days.”

Maloy, Huemrich and for-
ward/guard Jill Colabrese are
the returning starters for the
Panthers. Bruce said it was pre-
mature for him to announce the
other two starters.“Right now,
no one has jumped out at me.
They’re all doing well,” Bruce
said. “There is a possibility of a
freshman starting.”

°Bruce is also delaying the
selection of a team captain.

“We’re waiting for someone
to take that role,” Bruce said. “I
would rather it come from with-
in. We’ve got a team full of peo-
ple who can [provide leader-
ship].”

-Transfer Isis Mitchell, a
junior forward who transferred
to Pitt from St. Peters College in

New Jersey last year, willnot be
eligible for the opener against
Duquesne. Bruce said she
should be available for the
team’s trip to Penn State
December 19.

-The Big East conference
announced it will televise nine
“games of the week,” starting
with Connecticut hosting
Georgetown January 9.

KBL will carry the games in

Pittsburgh. Pitt’s game at Seton
Hall February 13 will be tele-
vised.

-The women’s NCAA basket- -

ball tournament has been
expanded to 64 teams this sea-
son, letting some borderline
teams in. I

“At least three teams in" our
league can make it,” Bruce said.
“If a fourth place team can win
20 games, I think four can make
it.”

He seems to be able to
adjust very well.

“You can just tell, by
looking at him play, that
he can play with anyone.”

Since the first puck was
dropped to start the sea-
son, Panther head coach
Ochs made no secret
about what he was going
to stress this season:
defense, defense and
more defense.

This coaching philoso-
phy has made the
Panthers a much more
disciplined unit than they
were a year ago. And in
response to Pitt’s disap-
pointing loss to CMU — a
game that saw a few
defensive lapses — coach
Ochs has taken measures
to ensure that the mis-

takes that plagued his‘

team will not. surface
against the Icers.

His belief in stiff
forechecking, tight cover
in the high slot and
defensive leadership will
be a definite key against
the Icers.

“When forechecking,
we really need to fight for
the puck in the corner,”
Ochs said. “And when
backchecking, we have to
follow the man all the
way to the post  push
him off to a bad angle to
shoot the puck.

“[We also] need our
center to work the high
slot we have to
improve on our condi-
tioning.” _ .

The Panthers hope to
see defenseman Scott
Giordano in uniform for
Saturday’s game, after he
has missed the past few
games for personal rea-
sons.

Giordano’s physical
presence and playmaking
ability gives the Panthers
a much-needed extra
weapon.

“Gordy adds muscle to
our lineup,” Ochs said.
“He can stand people up
at the blue line, which is
something we really need
to stress.”

“That’s what we were
lacking in the last game —
one winger and one
defenseman,” Ochs said.
“Once we get. them, we
will have three quality

lines and five solid
defensemen. That's the
key.”

Fans attending the
game can expect an excit-
ing, physical, high-octane
battle worthy of the leg-
endary rivalry which

exists between these two
schools.

“I think this game will
be very fast-paced,” Ochs
said.

“We need to keep the
shifts short, so our men
are 100 percent out on
the ice at all times. [Penn

State] is a quality team

silenced all his critics with his perfor-
mances in the first two games — 78
points and a 72 percent shooting per~
centage in two games.

Orlando is 2-0. Shaq is the man.

-Sean Bradley — Weak. Enough
said.

-The Bulls have done ok without
Jordan, but Scottie Pippen just went
on injured reserve. It could get ugly in
Chicago.

-Speaking of Jordan, now that he’s
gone, the Cleveland Cavaliers can
finally hope to advance in the playoffs.
If he would have left two years ago,
Lenny Wilkins would still be coaching
in Cleveland.

-I can admit when I’m wrong. Last
week I predicted that Riddicki Bowe
would knock out Evander Holyfield
by the seventh or eighth round. Bowe
lost.

But who was the real loser? It was
James Miller, the idiot paraglider who
showed up in seventh round..

To tell you the truth, I’m glad that
the crowd tried to kill him. Did you
.see the guy beating him with the
walkie—talkie? That would have been
me if I had been there. There is no
need for this foolishness in any sport.
Who knows what this guy’s motives
were? He’s lucky he got out alive. ‘

-I don’t want to see another Bowe-
Holyfield rematch. They would call
the third fight The Trilogy. Forget it.
The fight that everyone wants to see is
against undefeated Lennox Lewis.

It

is doubtful that this ﬁght will happen.

comes out of Miami. Sportswriters in
the Miami area have thrown around
the idea of trading Dan Marino. They
are thinking about trading a Hall of
Famer and letting unproven Scott
Mitchell lead the team. That would be
the equivalent of Kansas City trading

away Joe Montana to let Bubby Brister
run the show. Not a smart move.They
don’t want Marino? Send him this way.

“There are a lot of teams that
we can beat if everybody runs
the way they should,” The All

know that Mike and I will get
the job done because we have
been a solid [numberl one and

going to the nationals. For us to
run well, it will take a total team
effort.”

people and fans who keep worrying
about who the Cowboys’ Most Valuable

Player is may finally find out.

The Cowboys started the season 0-2
with Emmitt Smith out of the lineup
because of a contract holdout. So if the
Cowboys win without Aikman on Sunday,
anyone who cares can place the Dallas
MVP sash over Emmitt’s shoulders.

But the fact remains; if the best quarter-
back in the league, Aikman, is out of the
lineup, the Cowboys are not the Super
Bowl favorites that they are when he’s in
the lineup. It’s a team game.

And I’ll bet my last Kelly Gruber rookie
card that if you ask Emmitt or Aikman
what’s more. important, another Super
Bowl or a team MVP, or hell — even an
NFL MVP — they’ll each say Super Bowl
and smile.

-Anyone who missed the Pitt women’s
swimming meet last Saturday missed the
best Pitt sporting event so far this season.
No offense (pardon the pun) to the Pitt
football team and its14-10 win over
Southern Mississippi.

It was good, but considering how the
rest of the season has gone, that memory
has kind of been diluted for me.

Anyway, the women came from behind
on the last relay to beat defending Big
East champion Miami 127-116. It has been
for them so far
and I wish them the best of luck in their
pursuit of the Big East title.

°One last note: Frank White will be the
Boston Red Sox’s first base coach next
season. Anyone who knows baseball will
have a tough time seeing the classy White
out of the Royal blue.

30,000 Jews were arrested and
sent to concentration camps,
‘according to Meyers. “The Jews
were ordered to clear the rubble
and pay for the removal of the
debris,” he said. “Why should we
commemorate this event? An
event which demonstrates the
need for a national resolve to
respond to govemment-sponsored
persecution anywhere.”

Erma Meyers also had much to
tell about that_ fateful night 55
years ago. “I was 15 at the time.
Going to school [in the months
before Kristallnachtl became a
daily hassle. I had to sit in the cor-
ner of the classroom and would
be spat upon or attacked.

“lDuring the night of

, Kristallnacht] my mother, my 9-

year-old sister, a sickly uncle and I
barricaded ourselves in an upstairs
room of thethouse during the
night. But it wasn’t until long
when the mob gathered together
and broke down the front door
wielding axes chopping down
everything in their way. We were
[then] made to watch the destruc-
tion of our home and our syna-
gogue.

“Several days later we were told
by local authorities to have the
windows and doors repaired
because foreign journalists were
coming to town to take pictures of
our house and were to be con-
vinced that nothing really hap-
pened  We were not allowed to
