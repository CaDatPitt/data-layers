“The Right Wing attack is
not new, it is something very
old,” said Cathy Renna, co-
chair of the Gayand Lesbian

Alliance Against Defamation '

(GLAAD) of the- National
Capital Area, at AFrid‘ay’s
BiGALA lecture.

Renna addressed the “blatant
and most,forceful” exploitation
of the Bisexual, ‘Gay and
Lesbian Community (BGL) by
not only the _Republ«ic_an Party,
butlalso by fundame_nta1ist
Christian ‘groups such as the

American Christian Cause and .
Christian A

Pat Robertson’s _
Coalition to usurp and defeat

_ According to _ Renna,

’lvPresident Bush was "quoted in
_ The Was/amgton Post and T179

New Yor/ed Times as saying,
“Gay people are not n_orr_n_al.”_
In tl1e_pres._identia_l Debates,
President Bush add_ressed the
gay_-"issue__by. saying, “AIDS:

A “GLAAD _ is the media
watchdog. [Wei are nationwide

four or five more-in formation
as we speak,” said Renna.

.-..,Sl1€..saicl GLAAD can see that

thiscountry, ignoring the true

problems of this country."

According to Renna, the
AIDS epidemic is ‘being used
to attack ‘the ‘ BGL Community.
It was not until Magic Johnson
“came out" about his HIV
infection that the media even
began to cover the gay corn-
munity. , -

“The media shapes the way
we think,” Renna said. “It is
mostly due to media that we
have ourinternalized homo-
phobia. It is all we see  all
there is.” ,_ _

The consequences
twofold, she said. .

“The increase of hate crimes

Renna said. “W/'e.wei:e chased

The Student Government
Board candidates answered stu-
dent questions on \Y/PTS—FM’s
“News Talk” last night. ‘

Presidential candidates Jacob
Brody and Chris Skutches were
asked about their plans for
SGB.

Brody responded that he
would continue many of the
plans he has been working on
this year. He cited the escort
system soon to be in effect, the
flood lights on the Cathedral of
Learning and the Choice Dollar
expansion as examples of his
campus contributions. Pizza
Hut will be added to the
Choice Dollar plan in
November, Brody said.

Skutches emphasized work
he has done with a task force
on North and South Oakland
landlords. He said he plans to

form a liaison system between
each member of the "SGB and a
governance group in an
attempt to improve communi-
cation within student organiza-

_tions.
The 10 board candidates

were askedrabout changes they
would bring to the SGB if elect-
ed and what previous experi-
ence qualified them for a posi-
tion. B
Board candidate David Ott
took criticism from one caller

for his Army ROTC member— v

ship, specifically its policy on
gays and lesbians.

Ott explained to the caller
that he was glad to have a stu-
dent disagree with his stand,
but that his decision to support
the ROTC policy was based on
student needs.

“The people in ROTC also
pay a Student Activities fee,”
O_tt said. “I need to look at all

Last night in front of the
Towers lobby, Pitt campus police

broke up a fight between two’,

males.

Eyewitnesses said that in the
process of breaking up the ﬁght,
campus police used excessive
force.Campu's police declined to
comment because the report had
not been filed and they wanted to
get more facts on the incident.

Eyewitnesses harshly criticized
campus police for unnecessarily

Questionable force used toendfight

using a billy club to control one

. of the males in the fight,_who

was bloodied and required an
ambulance. The name and condi-
tion of the man was unknown at
press time. ’
Accounts from students differ
slightly. Pitt student Scott Smith
said that he was in the Towers
lobby shortly before midnight
when someone yelled “Fight,
ﬁght.” Students who were in the
lobby ran outside, as did the two
Campus Police officers who were
at the Towers desk, Smith said.
He said that the cops went to

V break up the. fight, but the two

males were still going at it. One
of the officers hit one of the
males with his billy club and “laid
him flat,” Smith said.

First-year student Yasmeen
Lewis said that the two males
were apart when the officer took
the one male into a body hold,
pushed him and then hit him on
the head with the billy club. She
said that there was “unnecessary
force by Pitt police.”

“It took at least 20 minutes for
an_ ambulance,” first-year student

God: through the spoken word and through the sung word.

“We’re being blessed this afternoon to be spoken to by God by way of
music,” Hickey said. “Oftentimes this is a lot more viable than the spoken
word. Music has a way of softening the hearts so that the word can enter
in.”

The North Carolina Central University Touring Choir has performed at
Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and has
recorded three albums. Its members are students from the College of Arts
and Sciences and the School of Business at NCCU. ‘

The choir performed gospel and spiritual pieces, many arranged by its
director Dr. Charles Gilchrist. One arrangement combined  Every
Voice and Sing," which was once proposed but disregarded as the black
national anthem, with “My Country ‘tis of Thee.”

The audience cheered when the proposed black anthem was sung, and
afterward Gilchrist explained his anangement of the two songs together.

“My statement is that we all can co—exist and live together, black and
white,” he said.

Occasionally throughout the perfomrances the audience would jump to
their feet in applause, shouting ‘amen’ and ‘hallelujah,’ dancing and
singing along to the music. ' '

Also performing at the event was the K & K Mime Ministry. Twin broth-
ers Karl and Keith, high school seniors, tour with their mime show, which
focuses on Jesus Christ and salvation. \V1th energetic movements and syn-
chronized dancing, actions spoke louder than words.

They interpreted several songs, including resisting evil temptations and a
man's transformation from doubter to believer. When the doubter began
to believe, the saver became jubilant and the audience exploded with
applause, jtunping to its feet. Several audience members wiped tears from
their eyes. 5

Black Week continues with Sister Souljah slated to speak tonight at 8:50

fund—raising letter, express—
ing his views on the pro-
posed Equal Rights
Amendment to the Iowa
Constitution as a “feminist
agenda [that] is not about
equal rights for women.
[Instead] it is about a social-
ist, anti-farnily political
movement that encourages
women to leave their hus-
bands, kill their children,
practice witchcraft, destroy
capitalism and become les-

bians.”

The moderate
Republicans ,were pushed
out by the Right Wingers,
and it was set up by the
GOP to blatantly go out
and gay bash —— on abor-
tion, Federal Arts Funding,
etc., Renna said. The GOP
and fundamentalist groups
used BGL issues, true or
not, to attack the
Democratic Party.

The one good thing about
it and second consequence
of sorts is that it didn’t
work, Renna said. “Staunch
Republicans were turned off
by this,” she said.

It was not until the
Democratic National
Convention that Gay and
Lesbian Civil Rights were
included in the platform,
Renna said.

“Especially included [was]
the first-ever Lesbian speak-
er, Rhoda Etenberg, who
addressed the Democratic
Convention.”

Renna said, “[There were]
signs saying Lesbian Rights
on PBS; 1 think that’s
unprecedented and impor-
tant.”

According to Renna, it
was after the Democratic
Convention that the “media
really woke up.”

Tara Munkatchy responded
to a question concerning
woinen’s issues being fairly
represented on campus.

“I feel as a member of the
board I could understand
female concerns on campus
as much as I can personally,
as a female,” she said.

Munkatchy’s campaign
deals with men as much as
women, she explained,
because menare as much a
part -of the university as
women are.

Candidate Torn Grassia
defended his plan to cut

groups, Grassia said. If the
groups aren’t getting money,
there isn’t campus interest.

“News Talk” ended on an
unexpected note.

Brody had sexually harassed .

coverage and Ybe Was/oington
Post started to cover our politi-

said.

“The gratifying point was
when the editorials started to
come out in support  of gay
rights,” she said.

According to Renna, the
GOP did not foresee any dis-

platform.
“[Thel majority of this coun-

“The country and the media

is organizing and solidifying a
network of thousands of peo-
ple so that when “something
happens in the media, 10
thousands of people will
respond by this organized net-

SGB endorsements

Student Government Board elections are just around the
corner. Students will be -voting_on~Wednesday for the can-

didates who will best represent the needs of the student

body during the upcoming year.

We are endorsing Jacob Brody for SGB president.
Although Chris. Skutches is a good candidate, we believe
Brody is the one who will get the most done for students;

the university. » .

He has worked with the administration on the university
budget, the Chancellor’s Task Force for Safety and
Security, the Cultural Diversity_Committee and the Senate
Council. We have seen many results from him as a board
member. He worked on developing an escort service and
expanding Choice Dollars.

Our endorsements for the board are:

Brian Bolton? Minority students need a voice and repre-
sentation in student government. Bolton is concerned
about the low retention and graduation rates of African-
American students, and he wants to do something about
it. He also wants to help promote Pitt’s Study Abroad pro-
gram. '

Joseph Foner — He has a lot of experience having been
on three SGB committees. He wants to get students more
involved with SGB by having random programs where
students can speak their minds. Furthermore, he has
shown perseverance and dedication. I ’

August hnholtz - He is _a member of the Pre-Law
Society, Pi Sigma Alpha Honor Society and the Mentor
Program. He wants to increase the lighting up to the fra-
ternity houses. Also, he wants to make a map of the safest
routes to take when walking around the Oakland area.

Anthony Moody — Being on the SGB Allocations
Committee, he has  lot of experience up on the sixth
ﬂoor. He started his own club, Rotaract, and said that if he
is elected he will randomly call 50 to 65 students. each
month to get the students’ voices involved.

Tara Munkatchy — She is the only womanrunning for

SGB.‘ She is not using women’s issues as her platform, *

saying that men are just as important to this university as
women. Shewants to work with the planning of a cultur-
al diversity center, having lockers installed in Hillman
Library, implementing the escort service and installing
more lighting on campus.

David Ott --"J He has a five-point plan: campus safety
through student involvement, a campus neighborhood
watch, a computer lab in North Oakland, increased athlet-
ic facility hours and joint activities between student orga-
nizations. Altliough he is a member of Pitt’s ROTC, which
still discriminates against gays and lesbians and has been
criticized for it, he has stood his ground on this issue and
has said that if not for this scholarship, he would not be at
Pitt today. We disapprove" of the ROTC policy, but we
think‘ Ott willbe a good board member. 5

Pitt students comment on the race

In response to Ed Kichline’s
article on October 29, I must say
that his “cold war” mentality is
passe and oversimplified. Bush
and Clinton have not neglected
foreign policy, but they‘ have
put it in proper perspective.
And for this you ‘need to give
credit to Clinton even though
Kichline views it as some mortal
sin. Mr. Kichline needs to ask
who benefits and who suffers
from his cold warrior stance and
“red—colored” glasses perspec-
tive. Clearly, those -who have a
need for health care, education-
al assistance, job opportunities
and a place to live just have to
get use to the realities of tough
ﬁscal times and start providing
for these, basics needs for them-
selves because we all know that
government involvement auto-
matically means trouble. In the
meantime, their “political lead-
ers” are off “making the world
safe for democracy.” That is,
they are paving the way for the
formation of a conservative, sta-
ble government for corpora-
tions. Well, who benefits? Is it
the poor who are somehow
supposed to feel pride that at
least they are poor Americans?
No! It is the military-industrial
complex that has benefitted

from the vvar-time economy. we
have lived-in si'ric.e'194.1'.-‘It is .

the presidents who have elected
to deal with foreign policy
issues that can be easily solved

by force and raise the presi- ~
dent’s popularity ratings. It is-
the family who feels a warped

sense of pride that their son_ or

daughter is ready to die for

“their country.” Starry—eyed
“Red—Baiters” like Mr. Kichline
and Bush need to go to the cold
warriors rest home where they

can exchange stories of how
they saved -the world from
Communists. I wonder if they
will discuss the miseiy and apa-
thy they helped spread as well.
Finally, Mr. Kichline’s state-
ment that “the last time a gover-
nor of a southern state was
president  “ is the logical
equivalent of saying that in 1980
the last president from
California had to resign in fear
of impeachment; therefore,
Ronald Reagan will face the

same fate. Mr. Kichline’s article
is typical of the Bush campaign
and cold-war mentality —— if you
cannot provide people with
humane ideas and responsible

programs, scare the hell out of-

them. The pathetic part about

this strategy is that people buy
it.

After witnessing the debates
between the presidential candi-
dates, I believe that the decision
that voters must ‘make on Nov.
3 is clear. Clinton is the man

"_ dentof thefU.nited: States.  _
V Early in the debates President

Bush questioned Clinton’s patri-
otism through criticism of his
anti—war activities. To which

Governor Clinton. replied, ‘_‘I was 
opposedto the war, but I love 9

Americans do, that there is-

dom. It is a shame that Joseph
McCarthy, excuse me, George
Bush doesn’t realize this.

Also, as Perot pointed out, the
public has to realize whether

questionableactions took place '

in “your formative years, or did

they occur while you were a

senior official in the federal gov-
ernment?” This statement could
not be any truer — Vietnam is
over, it’s our economy that is
the issue today.

George Bush also had the

' audacity to criticize Clinton’s

economic plan by referring to it
as typical “tax-and—spend”
democratic policy. What the
American people have to keep
in mind are two things. First:
Over 400 of the top U.S. econo-
mists have endorsed Clinton’s
plan saying “it is the only pro-

posal that will get people back.

to work and continue to fund
vital programs.”

Second: Over the past 12
years under Reagan and Bush
the economy has taken a dive,
and unemployment has been
rising. Over the past 12 years
my father has been subject to
layoffs on four different occa-
sions and our family struggles to
make ends meet, all the while
President Bush tries to convince
the American people that it isn’t

as bad as people want to

believe. Well George, wake up
and smell the coffee — it’s bad
and getting worse. _

Forging a family 9
friendly future

During this election season, families are
forced to consider which presidential candi-
dates advocate policies geared toward the
strengthening of the family. As we examine the
homes of America, we see the verdict is clear:
America is failing. Government must never
replace the most vital rrnit of society but rather
do all it can to encourage a family-friendly envi-
ronrrrent for all people in all stages of life.

For starters, the rrrain responsibility of govern-
ment lS to protect the God-given right to life.
How can we pretend to be concerned about
our clrildren7s welfare in our crime-ridden
streets, when 1.5 million children are torn apart
in their mother's womb every year in Arrrerica’
We will never stop the violence in the streets
until we stop the killing in the womb. Notice
child abuse has dramatically increased since the
Supreme Court decided to rule the mother’s
wairrr womb to be a babys cold tomb in the
Roe v. Wade decision.

Concerning our crisis in education, the quick-
est ways to revolutionize our failing education
system is by reintroducing competition. and
parental choice and by returning the full
responsibility of education to the states and

lrard4camed money to choose which public,
private or parochial school their children should
attend would force schools to improve or fold.

Ridding oru‘ nation of the l)Lll'(lCI'l.SOl1‘|C debt
that encumbers our economy is of utmost
importance. The quickest way to balance the
budget is to add to OLU‘ Constitution a balanced
budget amendment, which would require the
2 federal government to spend no more than

Garrett

what it takes in. Most state governrrrentsalreacly
operate within this conrmon—sense rest'ric'tion.
Also, a line-iterrr veto should be granted to the
president enabling him to cut out the pork bar-
rel spending congressmen sneak lf1[O;,;0Ll1'

on it. The reduction of spending, combined
with the pzuing down of the size of the federal
govemment, are irrusts to effectively remove the
deficit from the backs of our families and future
generations. Oirr mothers are often forced to
leave their children to someone else, while join-
ing their l]LlSl)21I'lClS in the work force, simply to
provide for their family‘s basic necessities. We
are only just beginning to see the consequences
of oirr first generation of latchkey kids. We._must
reduce the tax burden on families so they can
keep more of what they earn, thereby allowing
the mother to choose whether or not to stay at
home with her little ones. The mother’s I'lLllTU1‘-
ing is vital to the emotional, physical and psy-
chological well—being of her children.

Many of our families in the inner cities have

so as to receive more welfare. Our Big Daddy
welfare system shamelessly rewards divorce,
infdelity, inﬂesponsibility and slotlrfulness. It is
all the while silently enforcing the liberal philos-
_ ophy that if your skin is a shade browner, you
simply can’t provide for yourself or your loved
ones; you just can’t make it without the omni-
scient benevolence of our Uncle Sam.
Philanthropy must become err rogue again.

The private sector must once again retiun to
the community center stage. Churches, syna-
gogues, civic groups like Habitat for Hrurranity,
local food pantries and job training corps will
be infinitely more efficient than the federal gov-
ernirrent. Tlrese groups are much rrroie aware
of their corrrmunity‘s needs and problems than
is Uncle Sam.

George Bush and Dan Quayle form the pres-
idential team that most advocates these pro-
family policies. They demonstrate the clearest
comprehension on how to provide the environ-
ment most suitable for the health and well-
being of our fzurrilies.

local communities. Allowing parents to use their '

national budget at the last rrrinute before voting"

Dear Democrats: I love you‘ people. I
really do. You’re so amusing. Just when I
expect you to pass out completely, there
you are — all wide-eyed and bubbly —
with another drink in one hand and car
keys in the other; chattering about
grandiose plans and silly new ideas for
the sober to make fun of. By the way,
have you read the 1992 Democratic
Platform? It’s a blast!

I highly recommend it — if you can
get a copy, that  I had to make several
calls to all kinds of Slick Willy offices
before anyone was willing to send me
anything but a pamphlet about Billy’s
WWII—]apan'ese—pilot economic plan. I
finally spoke to a young lady who sound-
ed startled by my mention of the party
platform. “The Denzocralrc Platfor‘rri?”
came her response, in the tone of voice I
would have expected if I’d.just asked,
“How would you like to come over to
my place, get wasted and have hours of
wild sex, honey?” When she calmed
down she promised to send,m_e a copy,
which she did.

All of this calling around and being put
on hold (long distance) left rrre the
impression that Billy had something to
hide (perish the thought!) —— as if he
didnt want people to see his mysterious
platform. Then again, that’s quite under-
standable. I wouldn’t want anyone to
read my pauty platform either, if it began
like this: “Two hundred summers ago,
this Democratic Party was founded by the
man  who once argued ZIPS/.7011/dot-€13

 “ Yhctl certainly makes the average citi-
zen want to irriss “jeopardy” and- stand in
long lines in the stuffy school gymnasitun
to vote for Slick Willy. [Not to mention lis-

tening to little old ladies ask ridiculous

questions like “How do you close this

confounded curtain, deaiy?” as if they

haven’t been around long enough to

  

catch on to this voting thing.l To be hon-
est, the 1992 Democratic Platform isn’t
worth all of the trouble it takes to get it
(incidentally, it is not printed on recycled
paper). So as a public service I will be
happy to give you a quick overview
before you vote — it is advisable to know
what you’ie voting for, Clintorrites.

The United States is “the woiid’s great-
est democracy and economy. America is
on the wrong track. The last 12 years
have been a nightmare of Republican
irresponsibility.” [Every time the
Democrats criticize the last 12 years of

Republican presidency, you could turn
right around and say the exact same thing
about the last several years (56 of 60) of a
Democratic Congress — the last four
being frrll of the type who we really good
at writing checks but conveniently fail to
pass things like the Buslr—suppoited bal-
anced budget amendment and line-item

veto.l ‘We believe in free enterprise and '

the power of market forces,” but: 1) “It is
not enough for those in the private sector
just to make as rmrch money as they
can,” 2) “Economic growth will notcome
without a national economic strategy;’’ 5)
“The most irresponsible people  looked
out for themselves,” 4) “A sufficient and
sustainable agricultural economy can be
achieved through  programs’ and,5)
“wewill create jobs.” [In a “ﬂee” market
economy, it is not the TP.Sp()1’lSff9l7fl'I:)«’ of the
gotemn-zerzt to createjohs.

The platform is riddled with programs
for euer_vthi72g a “national public works
investment and infrastructure program,” a
“national apprenticeship—style program,” a
“national information network,” [what’s
tlrat?] a “civilian conservation corps,” We

[Watch out for this one, folks! The media

better read it again  ] They go on to

accuse Republicans of such hideous, )

things as “lurgingl Americans to  pursue
private interests.”l “During the past four
years, we have seen the corrosive effect
of foreign policies.” [I guess, to a bunch of
socialists, things like the removal of the

to “empower workers with greater rights.”
[I’d rather have a newspaper] Clinton also
takes a “vow to make the government
more decentralized.” [At first I wondered

how this could be, with all of these pro . -

posed programs. ""Actually,” a friend of
mine said, “a decentralized government is
the whole basis for 50Cic1lism.”l

To state it simply, the plan is ridiculous.
Clinton wants to use tax dollars to fight
vague theories like “global warming” (less
proven than was “global cooling” 20
years ago) and “ozone depletion” (not
proven). Those of you who think Bill
Clinton has moved to the center, he
lrasn’t. The only thing about the1992
Platform is its promise to “produce less
solid andtoxic waste” — ‘We will reduce
the volume of solid waste.” Well I certain-
ly hope so, people. I certainly hope so.

Not the messiah, but he's the best We have

He may be elected president of the
United ‘ States tomorrow. He may
becoirre the commander in chief of the
world’s largest military. He may be in
position to try taming the cyclical tur-
moil of the world’s largest economy. He
may be a great president. He may be a
terrible one. But nobody knows what a
Clinton presidency would be like.

On Jan. 5 a new session of Congress
convenes. its expected to have at least
120 new reform-oriented members,
including many women and African
Americans. There will be less incum-
bents controlled by special interest
groups. Due to this and to his personal
skills, Clinton will be able to work with
Congress better than any president
since Lyndon Johnson. The days of
Congressional gridlock will finally come
to an end.

‘After the Jan. 20 inauguration,
Clinton"s initial goal would be getting
his agenda passed within the first 100
days. The agenda has three rrrajor ele-
ments: creating jobs, reforming health
care and improving education.

Job creation will be approached in

two ways: 1) a program of public a

works projects, 2) the use of frozen
transportation funds to rebuild the irrfra—
structure. Clinton will use these funds in
a deal with Congress to gain support for
his health care and education plans.

Their vote for his plans will bring the

congressional member a share of the
funds for use in his or her district.

His health care plan involves a mix-
titre of public and private financing that
will make coverage available to every-
one. There would be legislation on

re.forirring health insurance companies

and rrraking it less difficult for employ-
ers to deny health care to its employes.

Cl'inton’s plan for improving educa-
tion is to enable everyone to get one. A
higlrly-educated work force is a long-
term economic asset. Through increases
in federal grants and making everyone
eligible for strident loans, more people
will be able to attend college.

Alongside these goals, a newly—elect-
ed President Clinton would pursue a-
family leave bill, welfare reform and a
law for stricter enforcement of child
support. They would pass Congress

Josh
Obusek

and be signed quickly. Clinton would ‘

end the “gag rule” on abortion counsel-
ing. The Council on Competitiveness,
headed by the vice president, would
finally begin enforcing the Clean Air Act
under Al Gore. And the Reagan/Bush
assault on individual rights, especially
abortion, would finally be halted by the
nomination of liberals to the Supreme
Corut.

At the end of these 100 days Clinton
could be very popular. But as the
months pass, problems could arise.

‘Rather than waiting it out, Clinton

[would want to work at ending the
"recession. It seems the only way to do

this is through an increase in spending.
This would increase the deficit, which
Clinton doesn’t want to do. So what
could be done?

There are three approaches: 1)
Clinton could ignore the recession and
attack the deficit with cuts in social
spending and tax increases, 2) Clinton
could ignore the deficit and tackle the
recession by increasing social spending,

5) Clinton could take the middle
ground — keep an eye on the deficit
and spend only modestly on the econo-
my. Of the three, the first is the worst.
Ross Perot and Paul Tsongas support it,
but sharp reductions in spending and
large tax increases will drain our wal-
lets. The result could be a deeper reces-
sion. ~ P - 1 — . “ =

' Clinton’s plan leans toward the third
approach. It has been endorsed by over
100 leading economists, including 10
Nobel Prize winners. It calls for modest
increases in spending and a large deficit
reduction. T hey’ll be paid for by tax

.increases on the rich and reducing mili-

tary spending. Whether or not this will
work, especially the deficit reduction,
remains to be seen. But at least Clinton
will make an effort to revive the econo-
my. There’s no chance of re-election for
a president that has presided over a
slow economy. Ask Jimmy Carter or ask
George Bush on Wednesday. Clinton
will have to spend whether he likes it
or not. This spending will increase the
deﬁcit. No one will be pleased with a
larger deﬁcit.

Only a miracle will enable us to have.

a reduced deficit and a booming econo-
my at the same time —- to have our
cake and eat it too. The American pub-
lic will expect this miracle if Bill Clinton
is elected. George Bush has already
proven he can’t end the recession orcut
the deficit. While America has been
hrrrting, all we've received from him are
a few tax credits and apathy. We need
a president who will respond to our
troubles.There will be no miracles in a
Clinton presidency, but there will be
effort. The same cannot be said of
George Bush. Keep this in mind while

you're on your way to the polls.

 

Dome is house of horrors as Syracuse pounds Pitt 41-10

ByJimLakely

Managing Editor
SYRACUSE,
N.Y. — The
G r e a t

Pumpkin in-
deed rose on
Halloween.
The Carrier
Dome became a house of hor-
rors for Pitt (3-6) as the
Syracuse Orangemen (7-1)
rolled to an easy 41-10 victory
yesterday.

Pitt head coach Paul Hackett
jokingly alluded to Syracuse's
pumpkin-like colors weighing
against the Panthers going in,
but the results of this game
were no joke. When quarter-
back ‘Alex Van Pelt suffered a
concussion on a sack in the
second quarter, any chance at
Victory was gone.

“I don’t think we were up to
it today,” Hackett said. “The
loss of Alex was a blow emo-
tionally for us, although I
thought [second string quarter-
back] john Ryan came in and
did some reasonable things.
When you lose your leader on
the field, it’s tough to recover
from that.”

The play of the special
teams once again became a
determining factor in a
Panther loss. While Pitt failed
to generate anything positive,
Syracuse was able“ to set up
score after score with great
kickreturns, the highlight
being a 75—yarder by Qadry
Ismail to the Panther 20 in the
first quarter.

“No question we fell apart
[on special teamsl,” Hackett
said. “Everything that can go
wrong in the last two weeks,
if you lump them together, it’s
a horror film. The special
teams took us completely out
of the ballgame ‘today. I’m
very unhappy and upset about
it.” -

One of Pitt’s few shining

 

moments came in the first half
as aresult of treats given out
by the Orangemen.

recovered an Al Wooten fum-
ble on the Panther one—yard

tesy of a defensive holding

throw, this time to Dietrich
Jells, became a first down fol-

ensuing kickoff.

line, Van Pelt completed key
third—down passes to David
Nottoli and Billy Davis to
move Pitt away from the shad-
ow« ofits own goalposts.
Seemingly stalled on their
own 44 yard line an incom-
plete pass to Nottoli became
an automatic firstdown cour-

penalty. Now on the Orange
28, Pitt finally stalled and set-
tled for a 46-yard Sean Conley
field goal and its only lead of
the game at 3-0.

Ismail, who finished the
game with 201 all-purpose
yards and two touchdowns,
ripped off the costume hiding

Pitt player jay Jones caught
him from behind at the Pitt 20
to save the touchdown.

“I had to race over to field
the ball,” Ismail said. “I came
up and the hole just opened
up. It came at a good time.
Maybe they were feeling like
they could play with us after

 

getting that field goal.”

Syracuse quarterback Marvin
Graves did Ismail’s return jus-
tice four plays later. He made
Panther defensive back
Vernon Lewis miss on a keep-
er sweep around the right side
for a seven-yard touchdown
and the rout was on.

Tony Jones picked off a Van
Pelt pass on the next posses-
sion and running back Marcus
Lee bulled his way into the
end zone from eight yards out
on the ensuing drive to give
Syracuse a 14-5 lead.

A mistake and an injury
sealed Pitt’s fate in the second
quarter. Down 14-5, Van Pelt
threw a bomb to a wide open
Jells only to watch it bounce
off the receiver’s hands.
Although disappointed, Van
Pelt and the Panthers could
recover from that, but they
could not recover from the
next play.

On third-and-ten at his own
20, Van Pelt stepped up in the
pocket and into an Orange
sandwich. Nosetackle Kevin
Mitchell and linebacker
Garland Hawkins simultane-
ously sacked Van Pelt, who

Volleyball moves back towards

By Chris Weber

Staﬁ‘ Writer

This years Pitt volleyball team
has been characterized as a
young, up—and<iown club_. look-
ing frighteningly good one game,

- thoroughly gruesome the next.

So with ghosts and goblins out
in full force this past Halloween
weekend, what better time for the
Panthers to display the grim side
of their dual court personalities
than in the two most important
games of their Big East regular
season? '

Forttmately, someone forgot to
tell Pitt that it was Halloween,

' because the Panthers showed their

good side and won two key con-
ference matches that put them in
position to win the regular season
title for the fourth straight season.

On Friday, the Panthers made
quick work out of Seton Hall in
three straight games 15-10, 15-12,
15-7, and on Sunday beat a scrap-
py UConn team in a tough frve—set
match (12-15), 15-6, (13-15), 15-7
and 15-9.

The wins improved the
Panthers’ record to 12-10 overall,
but _rnore importantly, raised their
conference record to 4-2. A win
next Saturday on the road at
Georgetown would clinch the reg-
ular season title.

“We are starting to play like we
expect to,” Pitt assistant coach
Cindy Braziel said. “These wins
are a. big vote of confidence for
us, and I feel like we are starting
to come of age.”

St. John's
slams Pitt
soccer 4-1

By Bennett Zamoff
Staff Writer

For the Panther soc-
cer team, it was a new

experience.
For the St. Johns
Redmen, it was just

more of the same.

St. Johns showed Pitt
on Saturday exactly
why it is in first place
in the Big East, giving
the Visiting Panthers
their first thorough
beating of the season, a
4-1 thrashing, to remain
undefeated in the con-
ference with a perfect
-mark of 8-0.

St. Johns’ impressive
victory also sent a
strong message to the
Panthers that no matter
how much Pitt has
improved or how tal-
ented Pitt may be, the
Panthers will still have
to turn it up a few
notches should they

‘ hope to find success in
this weekend’s Big East
tournament. Pitt will
face St. Johns again if
the Panthers and the
Redmen win their first-
round games in the
tournament.

The Redmen scored.
three of their four goals
against the Panthers‘ in
the first half as St.
Johns dominated the
Panthers with aggres-
sive offense and stellar
defense.

Robert De _Luca
opened things up for
the Redrnen by beating
Panther goalie Adam
Spitzer with the first St.

the game, to put the

Carnegie Mellon dominates Pitt

hockey club in 10-3 drubbing

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

The Pitt ice hockey club was greeted
rudely by WPCHA rival Carnegie Mellon
at Golden Mile Ice Center last night.

The Tartans completely dominated the
contest as they exploded for 10 goals on
32 shots in’ a 10-3 victory.

The Panther killers in this game were
CM’s Greg Hans, Roger Maddalena and
Dave Umlin, who each had five points in
the contest.

The two teams played evenly through-
out much of the first period. The only

- goal in the opening frame was scored by

Hans, who knocked in the rebound of a
shot by Umlin. Maddalena got the other
assist on the goal. '

Just 16 seconds after the start of the
second period, Hans scored his second

goal of the game, with assists going to_
Blair Echols and Maddalena. The score ,

remained 2-0 until 10:41 into the‘ period,

when CM’s Scott Sanbader converted-on_—
. the power play to increase the~Tartan’s

lead to 3-0. . . .
Pitt finally got on the board with 3:36
left in the period on a" goal by left

» winger Kip: Linse, assisted by Scott
 Kalson and Phil Laux. ’

CM regained its three-goal ,le,ad...less

than two minutes later on a short-handed
goal by right winger George Mueller.
After the Tartans cleared the puck out of
their zone, Mueller sped through the
Panther defense, got the puck and put a
shot up high on Pitt goalie Jeff Babcock,
who watched it trickle in behind him.
The Panthers cut the CM lead to 4-2
just 1:24 into the third, with a power-

play goal by centerman Bill Crousey.,

That was as close as they would get.

The Tartans scored four unanswered
goals to take an 8-2 lead and ice the
game. Hans got his hat trick at 3:30 into
the period, with assists going to Umlin
and PJ. Mann.

Just 16 seconds after another CM goal
by Maddalena at 6:01, Hans tallied his
fourth goal of the game off the feed from
Umlin. Sanbader then scored at 10:04 to
give CM the 8-2 advantage.

Pitt finally put another point on the
board at 11:17, with a goal by defense-
m_an Ken Anderson, assisted by Crousey.
CM. added two more goals before Kalson

0 got the final goal of the game with five.
minutes remaining. The loss gives Pitt a.

1-1 record in the WPCHA and a 1-2 over-
all record. _

Redmen up 1-0.

Just one minute and seven
seconds later, St. johns
struck again and quickly
began to pull away from the
Panthers. This time Joe
Navarino beat Spitzer low
into the right corner of the
net to give the Redmen a
sudden 2-0 advantage.

St. Johns sophomore Huey
Ferguson’s goal at 27:53 of
the half put Pitt in an even
bigger hole —— a 3-0 deficit.
Despite playing a much
stronger game in the second
half, the Panthers were never
able to climb out.

The best they could do was
Eric Prex’s penalty shot score
22 minutes into the second
half. The goal was Prex’s
10th this season — tops on
the team — and brought Pitt
within two goals.

But the Panthers failed to
score again and a St. Johns’
score with less than two min-
utes to play sentthe Panthers

" back to Pittsburgh with a 4-1

loss.

Panther Coach Joe
Luxbacher said he felt his
team played a strong second
half, but the Panthers’ prob-
lems in the first were the key
to St. Johns’ victory.

“We were a bit disorga-
nized in the first half,”
Luxbacher said. “[But] the
second half we came out and
played pretty well. We
scored and actually had
some good chances. We
could have scored another
one and brought it to within
one goal, but we didn’t 
But the second half we
played much better.”

Pitt forward
Alexander agreed with his
coach.

“We weren’t dominating,
but we were playing better
than they were,” Alexander
said. “We had the ball the
whole time, and we were
getting shots on their goalie.”

The Panthers’ loss dropped
their overall record to 11-5-1

Imance, but it was more
than enough to get the vic-
tory. ’

“Our times weren’t as fast
as we would have liked
them to be,” Geubtner said,
“but we got to the wall first
and that’s what [our] game-
plan was.

“Overall, we should be
really happy.”

Also lending to the Pitt
assault was sophomore
Christy Knobloch. The
Tampa, Fla., native took a
second in the 200 butterfly,
a third in the 200 back-
stroke and swam a leg of
the first-place 400-medley
relay team.

Pitt’s newcomers also
shined in their collegiate
debut, as butterﬂy specialist
Jenny Doran won the 200

butterfly while Jill Fletcher.

and Susan Poorbaugh took
seconds in the 200 breast

stroke and 1,000 free
respectively. _
Other top first-year finish-
es were Chantel Glover
(third — 200 breast stroke)
and Chrissy DiLeonardo
(third — 400 free relay).
Continuing the positive
theme, Pitt gotstrong efforts
of its talented divers.
Asuthey did most of last
season, Pitt divers domi-
nated the Orangewomen
with sterling performances
by Donna Flatch, sopho-
more Kara Sixbury and

rookie swimmer Sunday

Lewandowski.

Flatch nabbed first place
in the three-meter, while
first-year Mt. Lebanon grad
Lewandowski won the one-
meter in her first collegiate
meet. Lewandowski also
took second place in the
one—meter. Sixbury notched

second and third in the two '

CVCHIS.

While the Syracuse-
stomping is just one step in
the Lady Panthers’ climb
back to the top of the Big

’East conference, the way

they went about disman-

tling a league opponent — ‘

namely getting the team to
contribute as a whole —

speaks well of the
prospects for the coming
year, according to
Knobloch.

“It was obvious that we
were all together, mentally
and physically,” Knobloch
said. “We were a lot
stronger in the end —
pulling out races when we
needed to.

- “We’re back.”

PITT NOTES: The Pitt
women return to action this
Saturday ‘ at St.
Bonaventure. The Lady
Panthers open their ‘92-’95
home season on Nov. 13
against Virginia Tech.

and fourth in the first half of
the meet to erase a five-point
Panther deficit after five swim-
ming events. But it was later in
the competition when the
swimmers really needed their
teammates to answer their call.

With only two swimming
events left, Pitt trailed by 17
points and anxiously awaited
the outcome of the three—meter
board competition. When the
results were finally announced,
Pitt had swept the Orange —
taking theitop three spots -

and the Panthers suddenly

trailed by just three. _ .

Knoles said that the success
of the divers wasvery signifi-
cant.

“Witl1out the swing of 29
points from the divers in our
direction, you’re looking at a
much different outcome,”
Knoles said.

Pitt captain Sean Braud, who
took first place on both
boards, said that he was
impressed with the divers’ per-
formance during the meet.

“We capitalized on their
weaknesses and had a really
great meet,” Braud said.

Pitt got a scare in the diving
competition when Panther
diver Scott Ruth hit his head
on the board. Ruth had to
receive a few stitches, but
Braud said that he is okay and
will be back on the board
soon.

Early in the swimming com-
petition, Pitt had to contend
with Syracuse’s big guns over
and over again.

Syracuse distance freestyler
Jay Craft, last year’s top per-
former at the Big East champi-
onships, began with a victory
in the 1,000—yard freestyle. In
the 200-yard freestyle
Syracuse’s Jamie Secor took
first place holding off Pitt’s
Matt Brady to give the Orange

, their first lead. Seth Williams

followed with an Orange vic-
tory in the 50-yard freestyle,
and Sebastian Goulet contin-
ued the assault with a first
place finish in the 200-yard
individual medley.

After a short break the
Orangemen picked where they
had left off taking firsts in four
more consecutive swimming
events. Secor picked up his
second victory, this time in the
200 backstroke. Craft also con-
tinued his winning ways in
both the 200-yard butterﬂy and
the 500—yard freestyle.

But Knoles said the real key
moments in the meet came in
the 1,000 and 500-yard

freestyle events, where Pitt’s ’

Gary Mule battled Syracuse’s

’ Craft.

“Gary was able to take sec-
ond in both events, when last
year they [Syracuse]. took first
and second,” Knoles said. 

Mule said he was familiar
with Craft’s reputation as a top
national swimmer.

“I just wanted to race him
fast, so I stayed focused and
scored some points,” Mule
said. '

Knoles said that he was
unsure of how his team would
handle the pressure of facing
one of the top dual meet
teams on the East Coast.

“When you walk into a year

with all those freshmen and
they come through for you,
well, that’s what we needed to
happen,” Knoles said as he
dried himself off from his
team—sponsored post-victory
swim.

THE PITT
Volleyball S O C C C 1,
Continued from page 8 the ﬁnal game, 15-7, hit the ball well. The Huskies

lead 11-10. A deftly-placed kill by
Lucanie down the line completed
the Panthers’ comeback, as Pitt
took the first game 15-10.

Game two looked to be all
Panthers as they jumped out to a
quick 6-0 lead behind outstanding
blocking by sophomore middle
hitter Melanie Gustafson and time-

ly hitting by Lucanie and first-year-

player Sarah Mikla. The Pirates ral-
lied, but a quick dump over the
net by sophomore setter Annie
Memagh sealed the Pirates’ fate in
game two, 15-12.

Despite poor serving early, the
Panthers dominated game three.
Pitt capitalized on bad passing by
the Pirates and used a variety of
shots to jump out to an early 8-2
lead. Lucanie served notice as to
why she is considered an All-
America candidate, blasting home
kills from all over the court to
increase the Panther advantage to
a commanding 13-5 lead. Lucanie
blasted home 26 kills for the
match at a .533 hitting percentage.

“Am [Lucanie] was seeing the

~ block well today,” Pitt head coach

Sue Woodstra said, referring to
Lucanie’s spiking. “She’s a great
player.”

Seton Hall fought back brieﬂy to
within 13-7, but a service aceby
Gustafson would be the final nail
on the Pirates’ coffin, as Pitt took

“Seton Hall is a big blocking
team,” Woodstra said. "The key to
beating a team like that is to pass
well and put pressure on them
with quick sets to make them
move to the outside. That loosens
them up. We did that well
tonight.”

Pitt came out in a zombie-like
state early on against UConn,
showing little life and losing the
fast game 15-12.

“Sometimes we come out
expecting to ride the wave,”
Braziel said of the Panthers’ habit
of slow starts. “We sort of expect
to win no matter what we do. We
aren’t at that point yet.”

In the second game first-year
defensive specialist Laura Horvath
and Lucanie led Pitt back to the
land of the living with exceptional
defense and good passing to give
the Panthers an early 8-1 advan-
tage. UConn could not mount any
offense as tough serving by
Horvath kept the Huskies oil‘ bal-
ance. A service ace by Mikla gave
the Panthers game two, 15-6.

In‘ game three UConn got on
track spurred on by good hitting
and tough digging. A kill by
sophomore outside hitter Erika
Hanson (19 kills) pushed the
Huskies out in front 5-3. Long ral-
lies dominated the set, as both
teams played good defense and

surged back from a 15-9 deficit to
take the game 15-13.

Coach Braziel said the Panthers
knew their backs were to the wall.

“[Lucanie] was very vocal before
the fourth game,” Braziel said.
“She let the team know that this
was for the Big East and that
we’ve got to play with pride and
motivation to win.”

Four consecutive unforced
errors by Pitt spotted the Huskies
an early 5-0 lead..Pitt responded
with 12 straight points as Pitt suc-
cessfully fought for its life to take
the fourth game, 15-7. .

In a tense, quick-point fifth
game, Pitt and UConn each
played cautiously.

After evening the score at 6-6,
the Panthers never looked back as
Yanik rose to the occasion, roof-
ing the setter and nailing a quick
spike to give the Panthers a 9-7
lead.

Kills by Lucanie and Mitchell
pushed UConn to the edge at 14-
9. A service winner by Mitchell
gave Pitt the final game and
match, 15-9. - . ‘

“We’re in the postseason now,”
Woodstra said ‘of the tearn’s out-
look. “Everyone is a year older by
this time of the year.”

The Panthers’ next contest is
this Tuesday against West Virginia
at the ﬁeld house at 7:30 p.m.

 

Continued from page 9
and their record in the Big
East Conference to 5-2-1.

Pitt closes out its regular
season this Tuesday night
with a 7:15 p.m. rnatchup
with Robert Morris College
at Pitt Stadium.

A win would give the
Panthers 12 wins for the
first time in their 24 -year

history. .
It would also drastically
improve the team’s

chances of garnering a
spot in the NCAA 32-team
postseason tournament,
regardless of how Pitt
fares in the Big East Final
Four tournament this
weekend.

In the Big East tourna-
ment — which Pitt will be
in for the first time ever —
the Panthers have the No.
2 seed and will open up
against the third-seeded
Seton Hall Pirates. The
Panthers defeated Seton
Hall 3-2 earlier this year'at
Pitt Stadium.

In the" other first-round
matchup,first-seeded
St. Johns will take on the
fourth—seeded Georgetown
Hoyas.

The winners of the
two first-round games will
then face each other.

Alexander said that
despite the Panthers’ loss
to St. Johns on Saturday,
he still feels his team can
beat the Redmen, who
entered their game with
Pitt ranked third in the
nation.

“They have a good team,
but I honestly feel we can
beat them,” Alexander
said.

“[Butl we’re gonna have
to play better team
defense, and our offense is
gonna have to be a little
bit more productive.”

Coach Luxbacher agreed
that the Redmen are not
unbeatable, but said that
should the Panthers face
them again, they will face
a pretty tall order.

“They’re a solid team,”
Luxbacher said. “St. Johns
is very, very dangerous.
They do it at both ends of
the field  and they’ve
been beating everybody in
the Big East by two or
three goals. They’re gonna
be tough to beat. There’s
no doubt about it.”

Clinton visits Pittsburgh as the cam

By Brett Gilman
and Christine Birch
Tbe Pitt News

There were human—lil_<e outlines in the
tinted glass of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass
Building, and heads were hanging out
of the windows of the buildings sur-
rounding Market Square Thursday after-
noon.

‘Despite the wind and drizzle, they,

_along with the several thousand people

outside in Market Square, were hoping
to catch a glimpse of Democratic presi-
dential candidate, Arkansas governor,
Bill Clinton. Clinton was making his
final appearance in Allegheny County
before the election to sure up his sup-
port in the largely Democratic county, in
which Democrats outnumber
Republicans by a ratio of four to one.
The appearance in Pittsburgh marked

the beginning of a quick tour, which
‘would take Clinton through 12 cities in a

span of four days, leading up to election
day on Nov. 3. _
Several prominent party members of
the Democratic party in the tri-county
area attended the rally to show their
su-pport for the Clinton/Gore ticket.
Present were congressional hopefuls Bill
Coyne of the 14th district, Austin"

Murphy of the 20th district and newly..

converted Democrat Frank Pecorra of

g the 18th district.

There were also several prominent
. local leaders such as Mayor Sophie
Masloff and Councilman Pete Flaherty,"3 . '
_' who described the,Clinton/Gore ticket -
E asj.“tl1e greatest ticket in 40 —— no make

that 30 years.” A
"Also attending the rally was senatorial
candidate Lynn Yeakel. After being met
with cheers from the crowd of “We want
Lynn,” Yeakel responded by saying “I
want to be there, and I’m going to make
it.” - I
Yeakel’s message was that
“Pennsylvanians are fed up with the
quality of life

the abandoning of cities.” ’
joining Yeakel on the stage was junior

declining under .
-Specter/Bush/Quayle and fed up with

Senator Harris Wofford, who Yeakel said
“was soon to become senior senator.”
Hand in hand with Yeakel, with the rain

coming down, Wofford refused an,

umbrella.

Making a literary reference Wofford
said, “Let the wind, the rain and the
snow come. This election will clear the
air and end the winter of our discon-
tent.”

He stressed the importance of getting
Yeakel elected. “The Republican Party is
no longer the Republican Party’ of
Abraham Lincoln,” and a Yeakel victory
would mean the ability to overcome
Republican filibusters in Congress,
Wofford said.

But the featured guest of the day was
the governor from Arkansas. Clinton
continued to emphasize the issues he
has been focusing on ever since the
election began — health care, the econ-
omy and education, and the failure that,
he feels, President George Bush has had
in addressing them.

“Mr. Bush said we were crazy. I’ll tell
you what I think is crazy,” Clinton said.
“I think crazy is that unemployment is
going up and incomes going down.”

“‘It is a hundred thousand-Americans a

month losing their health insurance, it is

one in 10 Americans on food stamps. It

is ‘America going from firstto 13th in the
’ world in wages under trickle-down ,.€CQl‘f 7
— nomics. Crazy is read niyjli’ps' a'I)]Cl,isign—’
ing the second biggest ta'x"'iricrease in...

history,” Clinton said.— . . _ « -' , 7
When the issue of character has been
a central theme throughout thiselection
Clinton could not resist taking a poke at
his candidate. He said “crazy is the can-.
didate asking us to trust him with four
more years when we now know he said
to Mikhail Gorbachev don't pay any
attention to what I say trying to get re-
elected.”

Clinton continuously tried to paint his
opponent asbeing in the worst interests
of this country, and that he was the
answer to this country’s problems. He
said that while Bush is sending detec-
tives to investigate Clinton’s past, “I’Ve
been investigating your problems, your

 

Z \%\x\.

.promi'se,your future and that’s why I
ran for president.” V

He continued to pound Bush on what
he- said were failures of trickle-down
economics and said that America could
no longer afford “cross the board
breaks” and no more something for
nothing.

‘Clinton said that the extreme free for-
eign trade of Bush was not working, but
that it was necessary for Americans to
continue trading with the world because
it is necessary for growth.

“We want to create more millionaires
than Reagan and Bush, but we want to
.do it the old fashioned way, by giving
people tax incentives if they create
American jobs and invest in American
industry.”

Several Pitt students attended the rally.

Eric Engman/The Pitt News

 made a campaign stop in Pittsburgh last Weekend.

Junior Julie, _N_emec was impressed by
Clinton and said that, “As a college stu-
dent I am voting for Clinton because I
had a [Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency] grant for three years
and then all of asudden nothing. And
blame Bush for that.” ‘

University Democrats President Shawn
McClearn added that “Clinton offers the
most hope for college students of the
three candidates. If you want to educate
yourself, you have the opportunity.”

One 7-year-old student, Kate Barry
from Ross Township, said that if she
could vote she would vote for Clinton
because “I don’t think it was-such a bad
thing that he didn’t go into that war.”
Her 4-and-a-half—year-old brother
Michael agreed and added that Clinton
is “very, very good.”

Arlen Specter
Jason Hillman
Editor in Chief
Current Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter is
up for re-election this year against Democrat
1 Lynn Yeakel.
“[Specter] is a much more intelligent and expe-
y rienced candidate,” said Robert Wood, a junior
( } and member of Pitt’s College Republicans.

During the past 12' years, Specter worked to
increase the availability and amounts of the Pell
1 Grants and other student loan programs for
higher education.

l He alsoihelped create the “Student Right—to—

Know Act,” which requires all colleges to report
l crimes and improve campus safety. The
« “Campus Sexual Assault Victims Bill of Rights,”
which assists sexual assault victims on campus,
was co-sponsored by Specter.
S He was elected as District Attorney of
Philadelphia in 1965 and was re—elected to that
position in 1969.

A liberal to moderate Republican, Specter is
pro-choice and he has disagreed with Bush on a
couple of occasions. He has had support from
some traditional Democratic constituencies, like

1 1
\a \) labor. He came under attack by the right wing of
 the party for his stands against Reagan and
1 Bush, notably when he opposed the nomination
1 of Robert Bork for the Supreme Court.

Specter came under attack from women’s
groups for his actions during the Clarence
Thomas hearings last year for his treatment of
Anita Hill. Yeakel entered the senate race
because of her anger over the incident.

Specter is the ranking Republican member of
the Senate’s Appropriations Committee’s sub-
committee on Labor, Health & Human Services
and Education. He is also the ranking member
of the Veteran’s Affairs committee and the
Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the
— Constitution.

4 A member of the Specter campaign told The
i Pitt News that he was unavailable for an inter-
view due to a full schedule.

l A THE ELECTION ISSUE, Monday, November 2, 1992

George Bush  
ByBrett Gilman

Perspective Editor

Immediately after the Gulf war, George Bush’s approval
rating soared to over 80 percent. Now, over a year and a half
later, he is fighting as an underdog to continue as this
nation’s president for a second term. I

The single issue that has dogged Bush is the economy,
especially the rise in the unemployment rate. The inability for
economy to pull out of recession has left him open to much
criticism.

Furthermore, President Bush fell out of grace with many
Republicans when he reneged onhis promise not to raise
taxes. President Bush however has said that he will “never
ever” raise taxes again, and claims that it was a mistake.

He remains firmly committed to the idea of trickle—down
economics — which is based on the simple premise that eco-
nomic growth lies in a few simple tax cuts. These tax cuts, it
is thought by Bush, will be reinvested in the economy there-
by creating jobs and economic growth.

The establishment of enterprise zones in the inner cities,
offers tax incentives to those firms investing in the inner city.
And furthermore, Bush has been Very successful in the fight
against inflation, which has averaged a little under 3 percent
since he _has been in office.

On the political front, Bush rlelmainlsl committed to the
Republican line and the idea that small government is good
government. He has rallied hard for the line-item veto, which
would allow him "to go through the budget ‘striking out pro-
grams that he deemed unnecessary, and has also pressed for
the establishment of a balanced—budget amendment, which
would make it impossible for the government to go into the
red. ‘ , —. ,-

In order to halt the decreasing educational performance of
U.S. students, the Bush administration has held strong to the
idea-of parents being able to choose which schools —
whether they be public, private or parochial — their children
can attend. If schools do not perform adequately enough,
they will be forced to close. ' ' .

Lastly, the Bush administration has brought to fruition
many of the foreign policy goals of the previous administra-
tion. The Soviet. Union exists no longer, and Eastern Europe
is trying to find its own niche in the world. The threat of
nuclear devastation has been greatly diminished. On trade,
American firms have greater access to world markets.

Lynn Yeakel

By Christine Hanna
News Editor

Democratic senatorial candidate Lynn Yeakel’s
campaign platform is for changes in health
care, education and the high unemployment
rate.

“I think Pennsylvania needs a change, and she is
going to be a great asset to the Senate,” Pitt sopho-
more Danielle Roe said.

Yeakel said that she wants to put education at the
top of the nation’s agenda.

She supports Clinton’s prospective program for
college students, the National Service Trust Fund.
The program involves guaranteed student loans
which students will pay back through community
service.

“Anybody who wants to go to college can go to
college,” Yeakel said.

She also wants to increase funding for Pell Grants,
student loans, scholarships and work-study programs
to increase the number of minorities in the math and
science fields.

Nicolle Seperack said that as a student, she likes
Yeakel’s stand on education and as a parent, she
likes her stand on health care.

“My health care proposal, like Bill Clinton’s and
Harris Wofford’s would control costs by setting a
national health care budget. [It would] cut,outra-
geous administrative expenses-that keep great hospi-
tals from investing more in patient care instead of
paperwork,” Yeakel said. “And it would promote
preventive and primary care, which is far less "expen-
sive than the kind of specialized care which air: cur-
rent system encourages.” V " '

Yeakel said that there are young families" strug-
gling to buy homes or send their children to college
because of spending money on health care.

She wants to put Pennsylvanians back to work
through a “Rebuild America’? program. Eighty-billion

-dollars over four years would go toward rebuilding

cities, roads, bridges, mass transit and will promote
environmental technology. 6

She also wants to end unfair trade practices so that
jobs will remain in the United States.

“My favorite phone call,”
Forsythe said,”was an 84-year-

(At the initiative of The Pitt News,
Tipper Gore had a round table
discussion with editors from
Penn State, Thiel College,
Indiana University of
Pennsylvania and Pitt" -
Johnstown Branch. Brett Gilman
and Frank, Porco were the
reporters from The Pitt News.)

Q: I think a lot of people are
interested in your role in the
music media. When your hus-
band was chosen as the running
mate many students said, “Al
Gore, great choice, but what
about Tipper?” They’re not sure.
What do you think your role is
as far as that goes with college
students? Do you think you take
away from perhaps the college
student vote?
A: Boy, I would hope not. I
think there’s been some misun-
derstanding about what it is I
accomplished. Probably the
biggest misunderstanding is that
I’m for censorship. I’m not for
censorship. This whole issue is a
serious and legitimate issue. That
actually is about sexual violence,
the glorification of violence, par-
ticularly against women in televi-
sion, movies and in music. The
reason we addressed music is
because there’s consumer infor:
mation_ in every other media. --
television programming, movies.
Music clicln’t have anything and
never needed it 

When we formed our group
out of theconcern which was
“let’s see what we can do about
this, lets all sit around the table.”
The PTA got in touch with us
we formed a coalition. We were
then able to talk with the record-

ing industry. And they came up
T with the new idea of voluntary

labeling. We went through a
wide range of things like can
you put lyrics in the record
stores. It doesn’t change the con-

tent, it just says that if the con-—

tent contains graphic lyrics then
let the consumer know in the
store. It does help people who
are concerned about that and I
think, really it’s the parents with
younger children,
and it’s maybe
women who are
concerned about
sexual violence
being marketed
and glorified  I .
mean, it’s up to 
people what
they’re concerned
about. Make up
your own mind.
It’s actually a very
liberal position
based on informa-
tion which allows
you to make indi-
vidual decisions,
according to your
own family or
yourself. Many
recording artists
are saying that
they have
problem with volunteer labeling,
and they’re doing it. In fact that’s
why it’s so successful, because
the record company and the
artists are doing it.

It ought to be clear to students
what this issue has involved,

what the real issue is and what

my position is.

Q: ‘We have around the table
probably an audience of over
more than 100—thousand stu-
dents. Why should those stu-
dents vote for your husband and
Governor Clinton?

A: Because this election is criti-
cal to their future. They have a
stake in this election, and the
number one priority of Clinton
and Gore is economic revitaliza-
tion and jobs. And we can make
a case that the record of Bush

no Tipper Gore

and Quayle is failed economic
policies, the‘ worst economic
reality since the great depres-
sion.

People, young people, should
not be coming out of college

with those kinds of overwhelm-
ing burdens — for you all 
jobs, the economy, health care. I
would think preserving the envi-
ronment, education reform.
You’re aware of the national ser-
vice trust fund, which I think is
absolutely fabulous. Which
would completely scrap the
way college loans are funded
now. Which actually Bush and
Quayle have cut  .They’re talk-
ing about another $400,000 dol-
lars in cuts for the Pell Grant
Program.

But to start over with the
premise that the way we edu-
cate our children is actually an
issue of our economic security
— almost a national defense

‘ issue  So that’s how important

it is to invest in every American’s
child  A youngperson being

able to have a college education
or go into a job apprenticeship
program.

And how do you do that?
They would set up a national
service trust fund, in which any-
body could borrow
the money to go to
college. But there
would be a require-
ment, you would
have to pay it back.
Right now you’ve got
a lot of people skip-
ping out on their
loans and that’s not
right. So there would
be an oversight in
making sure that
people did pay it
‘back. But you can do
that in one of two
ways, you will get a
job because
Clinton/Gore would
be elected, and they
will have revitalized
the economy and
there will be a lot
more jobs, right? So
there will be jobs out there for
you, and you can pay it back as
a percentage of your -income
over the next several years —
not one that is going to cripple
you, but a percentage of your
income, and it could be a variety
in the pay out years. Depending
on the amount of income.

Or comeback and serve your
community. Be a teacher, a
policeman, a nurse, a guidance
counselor. Not limited to those,
but that kind of a job in a com-
munity to build up your commu-
nity and pay off your loan that
way. You know, the domestic
peace corps — which we need
to build up our communities
that are crumbling apart under
all the social pressures, and
affect our young people leaving
because they’re aren’t the jobs.

"TI-IE ELECTION ISSUE, Monda , November 2, 1992

Censorship not a? goal, says Tipper Gore in a.Pz'-tz‘ News interview

 

They will institute a jobs appren-
ticeship program  For those
who don’t want to go on but
want to be trained in computers,
in engineering, in electronics —
a whole range of programs for
high—wage, high~skill jobs.

Q: Governor Clinton mentioned
in the debate that he is going to
get the money to fund these"
programs from those who make
over 200—thousand dollars. Since
that is a limited resource pool,
he mentioned that he would cut
spending in other programs.
What programs would he cut in
order to get the money for edu-
cation and welfare?

A: I don’t know. I'can’t say
specifically what programs
would be cut. I can tell you that
we know that the programs that
impact people the mos_t —- that
have been cut — like WIP, Head
Start would not be those kinds
of program. I think what he is
addressing is the tremendous
amount of waste and abuse in a
lot of government programs that
are involved in red tape. There
is also a certain amount of sav-
ings that we are going to be able
to take out of defense spending
and military spending portion of
our national pie. So as I say it’s
wasted abuse, bureaucratic red-
tape, some of the defense
spending and yes, probably cer-
tain programs are going to need
a redesign to be cut. But I don’t
even think he has even talked
very specifically about what
those might be. But in terms of

‘ the overall philosophy I can tell

you it is not going to be those
who were hurt the most under
the last 12 years and certainly
the last four years — which are
the children, families struggling
to survive, the middle class and
under. The burden is going to
be a shift.

Pitt graduate Orrin Hatch speaks on college and George Bush

(Brett Gilman interviewed Utah Senator
Orrin Hatch, a graduate of the University
of Pittsburgh Law School, on this year's
election.)

Pitt News: .Why should a college stu-
dent, in particular, vote for the
Bush/ Quayle ticket?

Hatch: Well, I think the future really
depends on keeping taxes low, opportu-
nity high and having somebody we can
really trust in foreign policy. If we don’t
keep taxes low, the opportunities for stu-
dents will be severely limited. For
instance, if you look at the Clinton pro-
gram, he calls for $300 billion in new
taxes: $150 billion up front, 7 to 9 per-
cent payroll tax for his health care pro-
gram, taxes on corporate income and
investment, taxes, 1.5 percent, on all
employees for his job training program.
Plus he wants to spend about $225 bil-
lion more, and I don’t know where he is
going to get the money to do that.

So, if you want to continue govern-

ment as usual with more and more
spending and a centrally-planned econo-
my, then you want to vote for Clinton. If
you like to have emphasis on the private
sector with less federal government man-
dates, lower taxes, stronger national secu-
rity and limited government, then you
would want to vote for George Bush.

In either event, the only way you could

count on having a good future is voting

J.

for Bush. For instance, Clinton — if he
gets in there — the American people may
be able to tolerate for a few years more
taxes and more social spending pro.-
grams, but one thing they won’t be able
to tolerate in the long run is an upset in
the delicate balance between business
and labor. -

Right now there is a delicate balance
there with labor with a little bit of an"
edge, but if Clinton gets in, labor has
spent about $300 billion over the last two
years in soft money helping Clinton get
elected, and he is» going to owe them.
And if he upsets that delicate balance,
and it slants tremendously in favor of the
national trade unions, I have to tell you
that the future of this country is going to
be very severely impaired within three to
four years afterthat happens.

PN:: The cost of college tuition is rising
almost daily. Will the economic plan of
George Bush help to alleviatethe rise in
the cost of education?

Hatch: The rise in education has been
something that has gone up regardless of
who has been president because of a

variety of factors. But the Bush'approach

is one way of keeping down overall costs
across the board. Because he would -‘cut
taxes, he would limit government. He
would cut back on the spending of the
government, while at the same time
strengthening guaranteed student loans,-

Pell Grants, Stafford Loans, etc. — which
he has done ever since he has been pres-
ident. He and President Reagan have
doubled the federal funds to education in
the 12 years they have been there.

So education has not been bereft of

help. On the other hand, if we get

Clinton in there everything is going to go
up, because I think we’ll start a new
cycle of new taxes, escalated taxes and
inﬂation. And t-hat happens, then actually
the cost of education is going to go even
higher. And I don’t see how it can help
but happen with what [Clinton] is calling
for.

PN: We do hear time and time again,
that the educational performance of
younger children and older adults has
slipped relative to our competitors
abroad. Does President Bush haveany
new proposals to curtail this decline?

Hatch: We did a higher education bill;
and I don’t think you’re going to curtail
that until you do a really good elemen-
tary education and secondary education
bill that creates competition among pub-
lic, private and parochial schools. And
that’s what [Bush’sl pilot program on
school choice would have done.

It would have really given an opportu-

nity to poor families in six areas in this

country to be able to choose schools for
their children that they felt would be the
best for them. In the process, the less

viable schools would have to compete or
they would go out of business. So you
know, you’re talking about a president
who basically wants to strengthen the

schools. What he wanted to do —'—- well, -

his whole Education 200() program — is
a program that is designed to strengthen
schools and education. He wanted the
break-the—mold school approach, the
New American School approach. He
wanted school choice. He did not want
the bureaucratic installments that the
democrats put into their final education
bill — which of course we had to defeat
on the ﬂoor of the Senate.

If you compare that to Clinton and his
education record, [Clinton’s] got one of
the worst education records of any
Governor in America.*During the ‘80s
Arkansas fell from 47th to 48th place in
the percentage of adults with a high
school diploma. Arkansas ranks 49th low-
est in teacher pay, 47th lowest in per
capita, state and local spending on edu-
cation, 43rd lowest in per capita spend-
ing for higher education and fifth worst
in adult illiteracy. I have to say that there
are 28 states which use the ACT college
entrance exam as their primary college
entrance test.

Another thing that is important —— three
out of four Arkansas graduates have to
take remedial courses in college. That is
twice the national rate. And if you add
that all up, you compare that to Bush,
and Clinton is a complete failure.
