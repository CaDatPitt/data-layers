Trattner’s Motion
Kills Winter and
Spring Formals

By AL LEFFLER 5

Student Congress voted
Monday to back the proposal
to change -the Winter‘ and
formals, held in the Commons
Room, to senior and junior
class proms.

Joe Trattner, Col. ’55, made the
motion that one dance be spon-
sored by the junior class officers

1 and the otherby thesenior offi-

CeI‘S.

It wouldbe up to theclass as-

signed to the all-school spring
dance to revive it. Lastpyear none
was held and the preceding year

.,Was a losing proposition.

The December dance, although it
paid for itself, had an attendance
of only 400 couples out of more
than 1000 students who swere
graduated.

This was

dance.

Trattner felt that the class spon-
sorship would promote a greater
class interest, not only in dances,
but also within the graduating
class. He hopes when seniors be-
come alumni‘ they will still carry
their school spirit. .

Trattner made the mistake of
elaborating on certain details of
his proposal. He mentioned that
the seniors might have the De-
cember_ dance and the juniors,
the spring’iball, as an arbntrary
solution. '

Immediately Bob Sedler, Col.
’56, took Trattner to task, pointing
out that the seniors might better
handle the last dance since it posed
the most problems. The discussion
which ensued resulted in a restate-
ment of the motion, proving that
no sponsorship had been yet speci-
ﬁed. Sedler sat down.

Congress reverted to their same
delaying tactics as a proposal to
refer the motion to the social com-
mittee was made, even though it
had been approved by both the
Executive and Appointments Com-
mittee. ‘

A vote of the remaining coun-
cil members, as the meeting ran
over into ninth hour, was nega-
tive, expressing the desire to get
something done in congress. this
year. ' '

Congress ﬁnally voted to create
a committee headed by Trattnerpto

Doc Carlson to M.C.

Pitt students will have first
opportunity to claw out at the

West Virginia Mountaineers, at a‘

special Student Congress Rally,
Friday fifth hour. The football

squad will have second crack at
them on Saturday.

Columbia Recording stars, “The
Four Coins” whose “Will Be Mar-
ried” is-at present the most popu-
lar number in Western Pennsyl-
vania, will be featured entertain-
ment. “The Four Coins” originally
known as “The Four Keys” are at

draw up more elaborate plans with
student interest in mind. Congress
will then vote on the projected
plans of the committee. *

F r e s h m a n and Sophomore
classes might also sponsor dances
under this new plan. Since class
officers would take charge, thse
previously unoccupied politicians
would have a deﬁnite responsi-
bility.

SC also gave John Perri a straw
vote backingso that he could con-
tinue work on one combined bas-
ketball league at Pitt. This would
eliminate separate fraternity and
intramural teams and create one
league to represent Pitt as a whole.

Perri felt that the move would
eliminate rivalry between organi-
zations, and give Pitt school spirit
a boost. -

No I.F. Ball
This Year

Therewill be no Inter-Fra-
ternity Ball this year.

A close 16-14 vote at last
Wednesday’s IF meeting sank
all hopes that the annual "fra-
ternity formal would be held
this year. According to IF presi-
dent Don Kettering, a deﬁnite lack
of “group enthusiasm” was the
main, factor accounting for the
veto. " -

“Since enthusiasm is lacking
it is better that the ball is not
being held,” Iiettering said.
“Perhaps next year the enthusi-
asm will be more in evidence
and we can resume the affair.”

- Some fraternity men also voiced
strong objections to the suggested

$4.50 ticket assessment, saying the

cost would be prohibitive for many
members. . 0

John Perri, Student Congress
representative to the Intramural
board, proposed that IF council
consider participation in an In-
tramural basketball league to
include both independent organ-
izations and fraternities. It
would eliminate a - separate
Greek league. Such a plan, he
said, would cut down expenses
and serve toward uniting the
student body.

He’d wear it ﬁrst to English class
From thence to Physics Lab
He found himself, like most young men
Quite fond of his VAN GAB.

He"d wear it when he went to bed
Because he liked nice things,

And Van Gab’s special “ﬁnish’:
Makes it soft as angcl’s wings.

(Mrs. DiMaggio’s)

He’d wear it in the shower ..
And his roommates thought him daft
But he knew that it was Washable

And so he merely laft.

(Certiﬁed completely washable, even
for commercial laundries, by American

Fine, with tie and ﬁne without.
He was made for Van Gab’s colors,

ber woke to chase the vandals. The destructive team also
stopped long enough to splatter paintover the headlights
of.all the cars parked by the curb and to write obscene
works on the windows.

It seems incredible that such crude behavior could be
witnessed at a university composed of maturing adults.
Members of the fraternity house that the vandals entered
have estimated damage at $250. The sorority members of
the attacked house had claimed honors with their decora-
tions and were looking forward to their alumnae sisters
seeing their long hours of work.

Surely jealousy would not touch off anything so despic-

able. And it couldn’t be a prankster’s idea of college fun. i

I doubt if any/of the people concerned would have objected
to the traditional cracked bed or the long search through
the house for a mate to a shoe, even while being 15 min-
utes over—due for a date.  ~
But they all jutiﬁably consider this act abominable,
one of petty childishness. They, and all informed persons,
are anxious that the criminals be caught, not only so that

_ the hundreds of dollars damage may be paid, and that they

would ‘receive due punishment.

But itmight be possible to show these misguided peo-
ple that homecoming was-made a tradition at Pitt for the
undergraduates to have fun working together to _displ y
the university’s mental, social, and academic growth to Pitt
alumnae. But this years’ alumnae who trecked back to
their loved school and visited their fraternity’s exhibitions
a saw only exhibitions of stunted growth and thwarted social
and mental maturation. i .

,outweigh its advantages.

By Joan Thomas

Many freshman women are in a state of unrest
and dissatisfaction over the traditional guild pro-
gram which deters activities until November. They
are only partly justiﬁed in that they were acquaint-
ed withithe system ‘when they enrolled at Pitt.

The system was established with the best in-
tentions designed to giveiievery freshman woman a
chance to‘ participate in the
crowded activity ﬁeld. Commit-
tees do everything possible to
give the girl her ﬁrst choice of
groups. A

But perhaps its disadvantages

There are many justiﬁed con-
tenders of the negative idea that
those who are going to be active
in organizations will enter into . 
a chosen circle without help from the guild pro-
gram, and those who are in school merely to make
academic’ progress will join in a guild group sullen-
ly and resentedly, if at all.

Benefits Not Universal ,

It doesn’t seem fair to the many girls who were
active in a certain group in high school and anxious-
to continue along that line in college should have
to wait for almost‘ a year only because it beneﬁts

-to the liking of the majority.

Medieval C-uilds Revived

the few who are drawn into activities via the guild
system. '

It is actually frustrating for a member of a
high school creative group to have to stop all ac-
tivity for a year. Perhaps the guild system should
be designed only for those who have not already
chosen_ a campus group to work with by November.

For a freshman girl in_ the midst of more than

900 classmates, an activity, and a room to retreat to,

at times of loneliness, are a comfort. And it is cer-
tainly a way to meet even more friends than the
freshman orientation program can supply.
Intoxicated Enthusiasm .

Perhaps the guild system is due to be repealed
as was the 18th amendment to the Constitution,
recognized after its installation as a measure not
A freshman should
enter into a group meeting enthusiastically and
happily, in eager anticipation to make her contri-
butions, not with the same approach as the 1920
bootleggers ducking into blackmarket distilleries.

The freshman ‘women who entered Pitt eager
to resume group activities laid aside for the sum-
mer are probably just‘ a little short of complete
happiness due to the denial of total freedom by
the guild system. In fact they might easily, be
compared to the proverbial bird in the guilded
cage.

Hallowed Hydrogen‘ Bomb A

By Irv Rothman ,
We have learned to fear atomic

energy for its destructive force.

We welcome itsipotential to com-
bat disease and for use in public
power. But’ our‘ fears ‘mount as
human frailities lead us closer to
military retali-

ernrnent‘ hag-
g 1 e s over 
whether peace— _
ful use of the 
atom should be 
introduced by
public or pri-
vate enterprise‘
Unfortunate-
ly the Atom '
bomb far over-
sh adows the
Cobalt bomb as a topic of con-
versation. We have shunted our-
selves into an era of ‘fear that
will inexorably shut our mouths
before our minds, if it-continues.
Opposes H-Bomb Salvation
However, there are persons

 

energy who have revolted at ‘cur-
rent thinking. They don’t accept
the atom as a god of salvation in
its A-bomb, H-bomb forms. Their
thoughts have formed constrtfc-
tively as a result of our“ weak
foreign policy which has dropped
us from the ranks of a truly re-.
spected world leader. And they’re
in for trouble.

One of them,.Dr. J. Robert Op-
penheimer, is considered by some
to be the father of New Physics
in America. During World War II,
the noted physicst was director of
the Los Alamos A-bomb project,
and chairman “*5: the general ad-

cognizant of the uses of nuclear "

visory‘ committee of the Atomic
Energy Commission. In 1947 he
was elected director of the Insti-
tute for ‘Advanced Study at
Princeton, N. J.

Concerning the H-bomb, Op-
penheimer wrote, “What does
worry me is that this thing ap-
pearsto have caught the imagina-
tion, both of the Congressional
and the military people as the an-
swer to the problem .p. . But that
we become committed to it as the

‘way to save the country and save

the peace appears to me full of
dangers.” ' ‘ ~
Oppenheimer Risky

In spite of his duty to country,

‘the AEC last June denied the sci-

entist_access to government secrets
as a “risk”. He was accused of de-
laying H-bomb progress. Govern-
ment agents conﬁscated his con-
ﬁdential documents. The educated
became the suspected; the thinker
became the subversive.

Oppenheimer has-been investi-
gated for Communistic leanings.
Before the war he even joined
a front organization when Amer-
ican relation were frieridly toward
Russia.’ But he dropped out after
he realized the ambitions of the
group.

The most recent investigation
headed by U.’ S. official, Gordon
Gray, completely exonerated him.
It reported, “We ﬁnd no evidence
of disloyalty . ., . and postive evi-‘
dence ‘of the loyalty and love of
country . . . a high degree of dis-
cretion reﬁecting an unusual abil-

ity to keep himself "to vital

Of course the best dressed co-

United States. .

Scientiﬁc Convictions

Reasonable men know Oppen-
heimer for what he is——a scientist,
a man schooled in ‘the ideology of
development and discovery. He
would hardly prevent H-bomb re-
search. Rather the scientist lwas
wary for the uses to which small
minds might put it.

In the same letter in which he
expressed his earlier ' H-bomb
views, Oppenheimer also wrote, “It
would be folly to oppose‘ the ex-

ploration of this weapon. We have

always known it had to be done,
and it does have to be done . . .” A

But ‘one more educated mind
has been blocked in a bid for
mental and social progress. Con-

tinuity, of such ‘theory will call .

for a scientist. who will do the

bidding of politicians , when the’

need to enhance their interests
arises. Machines will replace men.

Yet, it is worthy to note that
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer was
reelected director for the Institute
of Advanced Study at Princetan,
Oct- 1. His ability was reevaluat-

ed and reaffirmed by informed col- J

leagues.’ Their fears are for those

‘ who are afraid.

Our diplomats continue to wave
the H.wand over foreign countries
to press ‘our position of peace-
maker. It is a pity that antagon-
ists of that philosophy are con-
sirede security risks.

But if looking at all of these

Recurring Cold Called Triple
Health Threat B y Pitt Doctor

Recurring colds are a “threat
to growth, nutrition and disease
resistance,” doctors and parents
were warned in Philadelphia last
week by a Pitt researcher. The
best place to treat a bad cold is in
a warm bed—-along with a good
‘who done it.’

Dr. Stewart S. Stevenson, Pitt
research professor of pediatrics in
the School of Medicine, and a Phil-
adelphia interne stated these facts
before the 104th ‘annual session
of the State Medical Society.

Dr. Stevenson declared that pre-
school age ‘children may be ex-
pected to have from three to six
colds a year, and be ill with them
for 75 days annually, more_ than
one fifth of the entire year.

Parents should isolate children
with colds, not only to protect
other members of the family, but

 

to protect the youngster from sec-
ondary infection.

“In general his diet at this time
is of no importance, but he must
never be forced to eat, for this
will result in vomiting—and it
may create a persistent feeding
problem,” said Dr. Stevenson.

The child should be given gen-
erous amounts of fruit juices for
frequent sipping.

“An excessive intake of vita-
mins is useless and may be poison-
ous,” the Pitt doctor added.

Harrier Streak Climbs
As Sowell Paces Pack

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Paced by the great running of Arnie Sowell, the Pan-
ther harriers extended their victory streak to 14 by trounc-
ing Army and Manhattan in a triangular meet at Van

Cortlandt Park in New York

City last Saturday.

Sowell, a product of Schenley

High School, covered the ﬁve mile
distance in 25:08.’? (nearly 18
seconds faster 3 C
than his clos- .
est rival) as 
the *4 Blue and 5
Gold won their
fifth straight
«this ' season
with a score oi‘
23 to Manhat-
tan’s 41 and
Army’s 64.

But Coach
0lson’s pro-
t e g e s won’t Sowell
be able to rest on their laurels
this weekend when they host
Renn State’s stubborn Nittany
Lions. The Lion—Panther fray is
the one that the boys point for,
and spirit usually plays an im-
portant role in the outcome.

The intra—state rivals seem to
thrive on just the thought of tang-
ling with each other, and this us-
ually commands the best efforts
of bothsquads. If the experiences
of past meets hold true to form,

 

 

the match this Saturday should
be a real classic.

In the New York meet, Coach
Olson’s thinclads invaded foreign
territory for the first time this
season, and were almost invinci-
ble as they captured four of the
first ﬁve position to assure the
win. '

In addition to Sowell’s win-
ning time of 25:07.7, other 01»-
sonmen in the ﬁrst ﬁve were
Captain Alan Gunderson with a
time of 26:13, Thorton Smith‘
with a mark of 26:24, and Jack
Schubert with a time of 26:39.’
Manhattaifs Bob Sbarrar ﬁnish-
ed second in 25:26.

‘Rounding out the top ten were
Ralph Stevenson (26:40) of Army,
Bill St. Clair (26:41) and‘.Gerald
Malloy (26:48) of Manhattan,
Bob Wray (26:51) of Army, and
Bob Cherry,of Pitt in 26:52.

Although Jim’ Moore failed to
run last week, he is expected to
be in shape for the Penn State
meet and should bolster the forces
of the Olsonmen.

Wildcat Victory Called
Mountie Stepping Stone

By GENE AROMATORIO
When a football team scores the winning touchdowni
the last 39.seconds of play, it’s a pretty good bet that their
dressing room will be a noisy place after the game. Such,

however, was not the case after ‘the Panthers. had‘ downed

N orthwestern’s Wildcats. last Saturday 14-7. .
" The triumph over the Wildcats was'considered as just

a stepping stone to this weekend’s battle with. West Virginia.
The Panthers’ attitude was aptlyé

described by a few chalk marks‘
on the black-
b o a r d which
s a i d simply;
Pitt vs. W.
Va. “Get the
Snakes.”

T h e b 0 y s
‘from Morgan-
town have top-
ped the Pittites _' V

the ,_last  two

years and some

of the Pan- 

t h e r s w h o Paluck
played in those contests have

vivid’ memories of the battles. As
a result, the entire squad is look-
ing forward to meeting Art Lewis’
Sugar Bowlers.
Win Evens slate’
A win by the Blue and Gold

would snap the Mountaineer’s
winning streak and put the Pitt
slate at 3-3. The Lewismen, on

 

the other hand_, will be trying to
beat the Panthers at Mountaineer
Field—-something they have nev-

er done. A Mountie win would al- “

so mark the third straight triumph

over the Panthers .-——— something
else that has never happened in
the series which dates back to
1895. » .

Last weekend’s win over North-
western was the second in a row
this season. under Interim Coach
Tom Hamilton. Although the Pan-
thers had the Wildcats on the
ropes throughout most of the
garne, they had to put on a the-
atrical ﬁnish to gain the victory.

Hamilton Pilots
Dawson's Team

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

Mostbusinessmen take inventory at the end of the year
but we’d like to look at our stock at the halfway mark. Of
course this isn’t exactly the midway but with ﬁve games
goneand a ﬁnal big four coming up, it’s close enough for a cursory
glance. ‘S

It was some famous sociologist who said, “You can’t understand

. the contemporary if you don’t know something of the past,” so, in

accordance, we search back. ,

After three tries with the multiple -offense, the Panthers have
switched exclusively to the T formation with Corny Salvaterra
the main reason. The result was a sputtering but winning offense
in the past two weekends at the Stadium. '

Another reason, which seems to be some fans’ opinion, is that
Captain Hamilton guided the good ship Skyscraper U. It must be
pointed o_ut, though, that ailing Red Dawson installed the passing
Salvaterra at quarterback before he left, that almost the same lineup
that Dawson started the season with is now coming through, and
that Hamilton has not changed anyof the procedures that existed
before he arrived. V

This is not brought out to show disfavor toward the Captain,
but only to answer those critics who claim that miracles have oc-
curred in the past two games. _ -

Hamilton has done well, but it was with what he was provided
‘by his predecessor.

Some of this adverse opinion about Dawson is natural what
with his leaving after three straight defeats and a new coach popping
in and immediately winning.

Besides, Hamilton has the -toughest part ‘of the.schedule still.

ahead. So, before saying that the good Captain has thrown the Pan-
thers a life preserver, let’s iwait for the proof of the pie.

And, those Mountaineers are just the team to start proving it
against.‘ West Virginia has been aching to get at the Panthers down
at Morgantown and will get their chance before a capacity home
crowd this Saturday. '-

Stories from the WVU campus relate that even the, freshmen»

orientationgprogram is inoculatedwith, the “Beat Pitt” slogan. In-
structors remind the frosh that “the” game is with the Panthers and
that it is of utmost importance that the team does not fail.

The only mysterious part of this strategem is that the upper-
classmen are the ones who do the playing. ‘

Theodore Leads rosh

to tie a heavier more experienced Penn State eleven, 6-*6,

Theodore was easily the outstanding back on the ﬁeld

  MONA LISA LOUNGE

Chances of the Panther soccer
team upsetting powerful Franklin
and Marshall Saturday have been
lessened. because of a muscle in-
jury to ~ star halfback Mike Cul-
hane. 1

Having injured his leg in the
Grove. City contest, Culhane may
be forced to miss the match with
the Diplomats according to team
trainer Howard Waite. The loss of

the outstanding back would deﬁ-‘
-nitely hurt the Pittite booters since

Culhane has been a big reason
why the kickers have been suc-
cessful this season.

Coach Leo Bemis plans to use
AliPelae in the starting backﬁeld
should Culhane be unable to play
in Saturday’s contest.

WHAT EVERY YOUNG com) SHOULD WEAR

Gather round, girls. Snap open a pack of Philip Morris, light up,
relax and enjoy that mild fragrant vintage tobacco while Old Dad
tells you about the latest campus fashions. _

The key word this year is casual. .Be casual. Be .slapdash._,Be rakish. '
Improvise. Inventyour own ensembles—-like s_k1 pants with a peek-
a-lcoo blouse,.like pajama bottoms with anermine stole, like a hocky
sweater with a dirndl. . o _ g _

(Dirndl, incidéﬁtally, is one of the truly fascinating words in tho‘

, English language.sEtymologists. have quarreled over its origin for

years. Some hold with Professor Manley Ek that Dirndhis a corrup-
tion of Dardanelle and is so named because it resembles the skirt:
wornlby the women-of that region. This theory is at ﬁrst glance
plausible, but begins to fall apart when you consider that there are
no women in the Dardanelle region because of the loathesome local
custom of’ female infanticide.) ‘ i

(Another theory is advanced by Dr. Clyde Feh. Dirndl, says he,

, is a contraction of “dairy in the dell” and refers to the milkmaidish

appearance of the skirt. But again close examination causes one to
abandon a plausible hypothesis. As every child knows, it is not “dairy
in the dell” but “farmer in the dell”, in which case the skirt should
be called not dirndl butt ﬁrndl. .

(There are some who contend we will never know the true origins
of dirndl. To those faint hearted Cassandras I say, remember how
everyone laughed at Edison and Franklin and Fulton and -Marconi
and_Sigafoos. [Sigafoos, in case you have forgotten, invented the‘
nostril, without which breathing, as we know it today, would not be
possible] The origins of dirndl will be found, say I, and anyone
who believes the contrary is a lily-livered churl and if he’ll step.
outsidetfor a minute, I’ll give him a thrashing he won’t soon forget.)

But I digress. We were smoking a_Philip Morris and talking about
the latest campus styles. Casual, we agree, is the key word. ,But

_ casual need not mean drab. Liven up your outﬁts with a touch of

glamor. Even the lowly dungaree and man-shirt combination can
be made exciting if you’ll adorn it with a simple necklace of 120
matched diamonds. With Bermuda shorts, wear gold knee-cymbals.
Be guided by the famous poet Cosmo Sigafoos (Whose brother Sari
it was who invented the nostril)» who wrote:

Sparkle, my beauty, ’

Shimmer and shine,

The night is young,

The .air’s like wine,

Cling to a leaf,

Hang on a vine,

Crawl on your belly,

It’s time to dine. _

(Mr. Sigafoos, it should be explained, was writing about a glow-
worm. Insects, as everyone knows, are among Mr. Sigafoos’ favorite
subjects for poems. Who can ever forget his immortal Ode to a Boll
Weevil? Or his Tumbling Along With. the Tumbling Tumblebug!
Or his Fly Gently, Sweet Aphid? Mr. Sigafoos has been inactivt
since the invention of DDT.) ’ 1

But I digress. We were smoking a Philip Morris and discussing
fashions. Let us turn now to headwear. The motif in hats this year
will be familiar American scenes. There will be; models 'to ﬁt every
head—for example, the “Empire State Building” for tall thin heads;
the “Jefferson Memorial” for squatty ones; “Niagara Falls” for dry
scalps. Feature of the collectionis the “Statue of Liberty,” cbmplete
with a torch that. actually burns. This is very handy for lighting
your Philip _lV_Iorr1ses, which is very important because no matter ‘
how good Phlllp Morrises are, they’re nowhere unless you light them.
We come now to the highlight of this year's fashion parade-.—a mad
fad that’s sweeping the chic set at high tone campuses all over the
country. All the gals who are in the van, in the swim and in the
know are doing it. Doing what, you ask? Getting tattooed of course!
You just~_don’t rate these days unless you've got at least, an anchor
on your biceps. If you really want to be the envy of the campus, get
yourself a_ four masted schooner, or a heart with FATHER printed
