Presby doctors plan for multi-organ transplant

ByJohn Zaphyr
Staffwrlter
Doctors at Presbyterian-

University Hospital are planning a
multi-organ transplant in a patient’s
abdominal region, which includes
his intestines, pancreas, spleen, liver
and stomach. The patient is a 37-
year-old Indiana resident who has
been suffering from a series of dis-
orders that have resulted in liver fail-
ure and the loss of his intestines.
Hospital officials asked that the
patient’s name not be disclosed.
“Due to the status of the proce-

dure (which is still under review),"
said hospital spokesman Thomas
Chakurda in a Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette article on Oct. 4, “it would
not be prudent to reveal the patient’s
name.”

A proposal for the multi-organ
transplant has been submitted to a
14-member institutional review
board at the University of Pitts-
burgh. If the procedure is approved,
it will be performed by Dr. Thomas
Starzl, a pioneer liver transplant sur-
geon. The board’s next scheduled
meeting is Oct. 15, but if an emer-
gency develops, a meeting could be
called at any time."

“There are contingencies that will
allow the board to meet in the event
of an emergency,” said Chakurda.
“But right now we don't expect any
change in his condition until the reg-
ularly scheduled meeting date.”

The patient’s problems began four
years ago when he developed ulcera-
tive colitis — inflammation and
ulcers of the colon and rectum. His
problems grew more serious, how-
ever, when the small intestine’s
blood supply was cut off as a result
of damage to the main artery that
serves it. The entire small intestine
then had to be removed, ruining the
patient’s ability to absorb food into

his body.

Since that time, the patient has
been fed intravenously for l4_hours
each night. The patient has suffered
repeated infections from the pro-
longed use of intravenous tubes, and
eventually his liver began to fail
when the bile duct became
obstructed. '

“That's not an uncommon com-
plication of long periods of intraven-
ous feeding," said Dr. David Van
Thiel, chief of gastroenterology at
Presbyterian, in the Oct. 4 Post-
Gazette article. “But we don’t under-
stand exactly why it happens.”

Van Theil said that even if the

proposal is denied, the patient will!
be given a new liver.

“We would like to give him a new‘

intestine, too, and give him a much
better quality of life than he would
have otherwise,” Van Theil said in
the Post-Gazette article. “He has
been [fed intravenously] l4 hours a
day since 1981. He would have much
more freedom (with a new intestine)
than he now does.”

Because of the close anatomical
ties between the stomach, intestine,
pancreas and liver, all these organs
would have to be transplanted. Only
his kidneys, which are functional,
would not be removed.

Pitt awarded 5 7 million
for Alzheimer’s research

By Kathy Campbell

Staff Writer

The National Institute on Aging
has awarded a five-year, $7 million
grant to the University of Pittsburgh
for the study of Alzheimer’s disease".

The study will be headed by Dr.
Francois Boller, Ph.D., M.D., who
is a professor of neurology and psy-
chiatry at Pitt's School of Medicine.
Pitt is one of ﬁve schools this year to
receive the grant to study Alzhei-
mer's disease. Pitt, however,
received the largest of the grants
given, which total $25.6 million.

The decision to grant the money
to Pitt and the other universities was
reached on Mon. Sept. 30. A press
briefing was held ‘ yesterday
announcing the grant from the NIA.
Participating in the briefing was

- Senator H. John Heinz lll, chair-

man of the Senate Special Commit-
tee on Aging; Zaven Khachaturian,
Ph.D., Chief of Physiology of the
NlA’s Aging Branch; Thomas Detr,
M.D. , senior vice president for the

Health Sciences, University of Pitts-
burgh; and Francois Boller.
Senator Heinz has been very
actively involved in the study of
Alzheimer’s disease. According to a
spokesperson for the senator, he has
been working for several years to get
money for research of the disease.
“The senator is very happy that the
money is going to" research and
development, but there is a need’_ to
do more," said the spokesperson;

Alzheimer’s disease counts for
nearly half of the admissions into
nursing homes today. Victims lose
their memory and ability to function
on their own. The illness is not
"covered by Medicare, so most vic-
tims end up on Medicaid. It is the.
fourth leading cause of death among
elderly people, next to heart disease
and cancer.

So far, $38 billion has been spent
nationwide for the study of this dis-
ease. There are more than 3 million
people in this country affected with

I Alzheimer’s, and at least 100,000 in I

the state of Pennsylvania.

SGB examines proposed changes in university calendar

By Jeffrey Carpenter

‘Staff Writer

The Student .Government Board
is examining several proposed
changes to the university calendar.
At the board’s weekly meeting last
Friday, President Luke Kluchko
said the Calendar Review Commit-
tee will meet this week to discuss all
of the recommendations.

The two proposals are to keep the
spring term intact or to eliminate the
full spring term and return to the
traditional calendar. There are two
options under the proposal to keep
the spring term intact. The first
would be to keep the reading days_ on
weekdays. The second would be to
move the reading days to a weekend
and use the two free weekdays along
with Great Americans Day to form a
five-day weekend in March.

Kluchko said, “The only big prob-
lem with reading days, if they stay as
is, is that they are not enforced. I
personally have had more than one
final during the reading days. I think
that it is important that if we do keep
them, they should be enforced.”

Under the traditional calendar
proposal, the full spring term would

be eliminated, but the sessions
would remain. The winter term
would extend into the first week of
May rather than the end of April.
The traditional calendar has not
been used since I966 when Pitt
became a state-related university.

The SGB now plans to ask stu-
dents if they feel it is advantageous
to get out of school early and if stu-
dents are in favor of moving the
reading days.

The board also considered alloca-
tions business tabled during the pre-
vious meeting. Questions arose over
the B’nai Brith Hillel request to
bring in Robert Clary of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center. The Simon
Wiesenthal Center is a charitable
organization for the preservation of
holocaust education in America.
Last week, there was question over
whether the payment of Robert
Clary’s fee directly to the center
would be considered a charitable
contribution, which would be in vio-
lation of allocations policy.

Pamela Underwood, chairperson
of the Allocations Committee, said
in a memo to the board, “According
to the contract from the center, the
$3000 ‘honorarium’ for Mr. Clary

“The only big problem with reading days, if they stay
as is, is that they are not enforced.”

—— SBG president Lulte Kluchko

After calling the -center  I found
out the center is a charitable organi-
zation. The center receives $3000
from the proposed institution, and
in return for [Mr. Clary’s] services,
the center pays [him] $1500. Fund-
ing of this event violates a stipula-
tion that funds may not be donated
to religious, political, volunteer and
charitable causes, since $1500 would
be donated directly to a religious
cause/ charitable organization.”

But board member Averv Abrams
said, “An agreement has been
reached with the Simon Wiesenthal
Center and Mr. Clary that the $3000
be made in a check directly to Mr.
Clary, and it will be up to him as to
the use of that money. The Student
Government Board will not be
donating any money to a charitable
organization."

The Board the voted 5-2 to reject

\

mendation to deny the request. The
proposal will now be returned to
allocations for one week for further
consideration. .

During the fall term, the SGB
considers any unwritten allocations
policies that were practiced during
the previous allocations process. On
Friday, the board approved two
proposals that eliminated the fund-
ing of on or off‘-campus concerts and
placement and career programs for
undergraduate schools or academic
units. The proposals will now go to
the Office of Student Activities for
approval.

In other business, board member
Pete Petropoulos moved that the
board increase the number of
members attending the American
Association of University Students
Conference at Purdue on Oct. l9-20
from three to four. Petropoulos said

highly represented as possible, and
that it would only cost an extra $23.
He also said that someone who
attended last year should be able to
attend again this year.

Board member Lisa Douds dis-
agreed. “I think three people will
suffice,” she said. ‘‘I think the three
people who are going can be briefed
by the person who went last year.”
The motion was tabled by a vote of
5-3 for further study. .

Petropoulos reported that the
Monday Morning Quarterback
Club was going well. He said attend-
ance was increasing, and that more
T-shirts were available. The Quar-
terback Club will meet this morning
at l2 noon in the William Pitt Union
Ballroom, and it is free to students.

Board member Karen Frost
reported that she is in search of stu-
dents with off-campus housing
problems. She said, “We are willing
to hear from you, get any informa-
tion or any advice you can give us in
solving the problem.“

And finally, interviews for the
Affirmative _Action Committee
chairperson will be held this Wed-
nesday night. Board member Mike

(Soviet Union) — It’s the first
time the Soviets have let a deadline
pass without buying grain as prom-
ised in its grain pacts with the United
States. The Kremlin even honored
the agreement when Jimmy Carter
imposed a partial embargo in I980.

The first five-year U.S.-Soviet
agreement went into effect in I976.
It was extended twice, before a new
ﬁve-year agreement went into effect
in 1983.

For the second year of the agree-
ment that ended last week, the
Soviets bought a record 15.75 mil-
lion tons of corn even though the

. purchase of nearly 2.9 million tons

of wheat fell below the minimum.

John Hinckley
has girlfriend

(WASHINGTON) — There’s
word of a liason involving one of
America’s most notorious figures. A
judge says John Hinckley — the
man who shot President Reagan —
has had a “languishing relationship”

with another mental patient. There
are doubts, however, about a report
that the two would — or could —
marry. The woman is Leslie Deveau,
who was ruled mentally incompe-
tent in the shooting death of her 10-
year-old daughter. Hinckley was
found not guilty of shooting the
president on grounds of insanity. A
federal judge in Washington D.C.
says it isn’t clear if two people ruled
mentally incompetent can enter into
a legal contract such as marriage.

Israel prepares
to wage “long war”
against terrorism

Israeli defense minister Yitzhak
Rabin said (on CBS’ “Face the
Nation") that his country is pre-
pared to wage “a long war” against
terrorism. He warned “all countries
in the area" against giving refuge to
terrorist groups.

Rabin said Israel “did not attack
Tunisia.” Instead, he explained that
Israel “attacked terrorist organiza-

tions that are located there.”

Last week, Egypt said the Israeli
air attack in Tunisia was a “fatal
blow” to peace efforts in the
Mideast, but yesterday Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarek left open
the chance for renewed peace talks.

Mubarek said prospects for reviv-
ing the peace effort “depend on the
behavior” of Israel. He added,'“We
are going to do our best.”

A cease-fire in Lebanon was
quickly broken yesterday, and at
least four people were killed before a
second truce put a stop to fighting in
residential areas.-

National Security adviser Robert
McFarland said (on NBC’s “Meet
the Press”) that “milestones of pro-
gress” toward peace in the Middle
East can be achieved “within a
month’s time.”

However, McFarland acknowl-
edged that last week’s Israeli air raid
against PLO headquarters in Tuni-
sia had “a sobering effect” that has
led to what he called “some retrench-
ment” of all parties involved in peace
efforts.

Apartheid called
‘cruel and inhuman’

(SOUTH AFRICA) —— A dissi-
dent church leader in South Africa,
the Reverend Allan Boesak, spoke
outagainst South Africa’s racial
separation laws-yesterday in Cape
Town. He labelled apartheid a
“cruel and inhuman" policy and
urged blacks to free themselves.

The United Democratic Front, a
group Boesak founded, also charged
yesterday that police who monitor
classes in some black schools forced
children to school with whips and
beat blacks in their homes and in
jail.

The charges came as two news-
papers in South Africa report that

Senate seeks
debt ceiling hike

(WASHINGTON) — The
Senate failed in a bid to quash a
Democratic-led filibuster against a
proposal to force a balanced budget
by l99l, blocking action on an emer-
gency bill to raise the national debt
ceiling. Without the debt ceiling
hike, the government will begin run-
ning out of money for social security
checks and the federal payroll today.
The Senate split along party lines,
voting 57-38 to limit debate on the
budget-balancing proposal. That
was six votes short of the majority
needed. Senate majority leader
Robert Dole scheduled another vote
to limit debate for today.

FBI agent shot

by fellow agents

(PHOENIX, Ariz.) — Police in
Phoenix say a case of mistaken iden-
tity led to the fatal shooting of a
woman FBI agent during a gunbat-
tle with a suspected armed robber.

An FBI spokesman refused to
comment on the shooting death of
33-year-old Robin Ahrens. the first
woman agent killed since women
joined the bureau in 1972.

But Phoenix police chief Ruben
Ortega said yesterday that Ahrens
apparently was shot Friday by two
fellow agents who mistook her fora
robbery suspect’s girlfriend.

Ortega described the shooting this
way: A group of FBI agents went to
an apartment building and after a
struggle, arrested Kenneth Barrett, a
suspect in the robbery last month of
an armored car courier in Las Vegas.

Then, according to the police
chief, two agents saw a woman with
a gun come out of a dark passage-
way between two buildings in the
apartment complex and opened fire.
The woman turned out to be
Ahrens.

The FBI has launched a full-scale
investigation that is expected to take
several days.

Study reveals
miles of walking

At the end of the day, a lot of us
are glad to get off our feet. Ever
wonder how many miles you cover
on the job?

A new study suggests that some
workers may walk as far as 2500
miles a year, roughly the distance
between New York and Las Vegas.

The Dr. Scholl’s working-day
study of 110 workers in Chicago
found that men and women in “foot
intensive”jobs will walk an average
of five miles a day. The workers,
representing 20 occupations, wore
pedometers to measure how far they
walked.

You might think that letter carri-
ers do the most walking on thejob.
But the study shows they walked less
distance per day than retail store
clerks.

City messengers put in the most
daily miles on foot —— 10.3 miles.
Mail carriers put in 6.5. Just under
that were restaurant employees at
6.3 miles.

The study found hairstylists walk
4.9 miles a day. Bank employees put
in 4.5.The homemakers walked 4.3
miles.

Toward the bottom of the list of
20 occupations were clerical workers
— 2.3 miles. Newspaper reporters
and editors put in only 1.5 miles.
And dentist office workers walked
only l.2 miles a day on thejob.

Interesting to note is that mail car-
riers, bank employees, newspaper
reporters and law clerks said being

on their feet made them feel
energized.

Nurses, food servers,‘ clerical
worker, retail store employees,

homemakers and law enforcement
officers had negative feelings. They
equated foot fatigue with a drop in
energy level and injob performance.

Rescuers doubt

survival of boy

(MEXICO) — Rescue workers
have all but given up hope offinding
a nine-year-old boy alive who was
buried in the ruins of one of the
recent earthquakes in Mexico.

Yesterday, the Mexican police
chief raised doubts as to whether the
child was still alive, trapped in the
rubble of an apartment complex
that collapsed in a major tremor last
month.

The police chief said, “We want to
hear concrete reality. There is no
sign of life. Everything else is just
tales.”

For five days, volunteers dug to
reach little Luis Ramon Nafarette,
but rescue workers say the child
indicated he was alive and well by
tapping twice for “yes” and once for
“no.”

Those tapping s0,.unds have
stopped. An engineer directing
rescue operations in Mexico City
said, “Certainly thereis no life.”

Around the World

He says that rescue efforts will
continue until the child’s body is
recovered.

Monroe death
remains mystery

(HOLLYWOOD, Calif.) — A
new report on Marilyn Monroe and
Robert Kennedy claims that Mon-
roe’s former housekeeper said
Kennedy visited the actress ‘and
ended their affair the day she swal-
lowed an overdose of pills that killed
her.

The report is in Picture Week
Magazine, which quotes a British
Broadcasting Corporation
documentary.

,Picture Week said the house-
keeper would not repeat her account
of Kennedy's presence in Monroe’s
house the day she died. However,

the BBC says the same report came -

from another now-dead source,
actor Peter Lawford, by way of his
third wife.

The executive producer of the
BBC documentary, “The Last Days
of Marilyn Monroe,” said it will
answer many questions that fol-
lowed the star’s death in I962.

The author of “Goddess,” a new
book about Monroe, speculates that
Robert Kennedy became involved
with the actress while trying to per-
suade her to break off an affair with,
his brother, President John
Kennedy.

Space shuttle
returns to earth

(Calif.) —— With its secret mission
for the defense department com-
pleted, the new space shuttle Atlan-
tis will return to earth for its first
landing this morning at Edwards Air
Force Base. Atlantis is scheduled to
land at I p.m. (EDT),and UPI radio
correspondent Rob Navias will be
on hand to provide live coverage of
the touchdown.

Philly paper
continues strike

(PHILADELPHIA, Pa.) — Neg-
otiating teams from both sides ofthe
Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily
News strike met separately again
yesterday with the federal mediator.

A union spokesman said the meet-
ings, which have been going on for
the last week, are an attempt to bring
the two sides close enough to bar-
gain in a face-to-face session.

Bill Broom, a spokesman for Phil-
adelphia Newspapers Inc., said the
separate meetings lasted I2 hours
Saturday and 10 hours Friday.

When the talks broke down last
week, the company had offered a
$90 wage and benefit raise over the

three-year life of the contract. At '

that time, striking workers were ask-
ing for a $170 pay hike and increased
benefits.

Mayor Richard Caliguiri in the past week has made it

clear that he wants to keep the Pirates in Pittsburgh. In

_ order to do this, themayor has proposed plan to pur-
chase the team through a private-public coalition involv-
inglthe City of Pittsburgh and 14 or 15 private persons
and corporations yet to be named.

What this will mean to the taxpayers is not yet clear,
but the mayor estimates that the yearly toll will be $500
thousand if the stadium can be sold, and if not, it (will be
in the neighborhood of $3 million. Even assuming that
the mayor's estimate is conservative and that other costs

a have not been fully considered (such as the tax payers
obligation to ﬁnance bonds on the stadium and smaller
costs like player salary liabilities), we are already weary of
the mayor's plan.

Regardless of the final costs, the mayor is planning to

' ‘ involve the county. In fact, it seems that county involve-
ment will be essential. Fortunately, at least two county
commissioners, Tom Foerster and Barbara Hafer, are
approaching the deal cautiously. Why? Well, perhaps
they see the inevitable financial burden involved, or per-

‘ haps they've noticed that Pittsburghers don’t seem to
support the team, whether it is because the Pirates had a
bad season or that many who once frequented their

, games — like those in the Mon-Valley —— can no longer

' afford to go. Perhaps they even see that there are things

’ thattake precedence over bailing out a private entertain-
ment concern. ’

If this is the case, we agree. Like they say, ”When the
going gets tough, the tough get going.” Mayor Caliguiri
should respect this bit of wisdom and realize that the

' county has more important things to do with its money
than undermine the free enterprise system.

Editorial Reproof

During my four years of under,-
graduate study at this university I
have seen, and perhaps have even
been responsible for, irresponsible
statements published in The Pitt
News. In all of this time I have never
seen this irresponsibility exercised
by the editorial board of The Pitt
News in their own editorials to such
a degree as to be nothing short of
reprehensible.

In the Oct. 4 editorial, The Pitt
News leveled an accusation which
evinces the responsibility and integ-
rity of the drafters of the infamous
Protocals of the Elders of Zion. The

Pitt News states that it is “time that '

U.S. decision-makers heed their
consciences and stop allowing very
small but powerful lobby groups to
dictate US. policy in the Middle.
East.”

Can the editors of The Pitt News
honestly believe that six million
Jews, out of the U.S. population in
excess of 250 million people, dictate
U.S. foreign policy? Can the editors
of The Pitt News shamelessly put
forth the proposition that the Jews
control the U.S. government? Yet
this is exactly the proposition which
they have ﬂoated.

These accusations are not new.
They have been put forth by more
skilled journalists than those of The
Pitt News, for example, the drafters
of the Protocals of the Elders of
Zion, the propagandists of Hitler’s
Third Reich and most recently by
the KKK and the various White
Supremacist organizations in this
country.

As a member of this university’s
community I am shamed by this edi-
torial. If the editorial staff honestly
believes their proposal I am shamed
by their ignorance and anti-
semitism. If the editorial staff was
unaware of the implications oftheir
proposal I am shamed by their
irresponsibility.

Travers Blasted

I found Bob Travers’ column on
the sporting life (The Pitt News,
Sept. 30, I985), to be totally absurd.

To begin with, it is true that peo-
ple are killed every hunting season.
But then again, people are killed
while driving an automobile. I don’t
know about you, Mr. Travers, but

‘ the last time I looked at the statistics,

more people were killed while driv-
ing under the inﬂuence of alcohol
than were killed in a hunting acci-

dent. Which brings me to mynext »

point: The No. 1 killer of people is
carelessness. What can be done
about this, you say? Hunter safety
classes are the answer. The state of
Pennsylvania now requires all new
hunters to obtain a safety card which
is provided upon completion of a
safety class and a comprehensive test
following the class.

Mr. Travers continues his sarcas-
tic editorial by mentioning high inci-
dents of frostbite. Let me emphasize
that amateurs who don’t have sense
enough to wear insulated gloves and
protect themselves from the ele-
ments deserve what they get, but
their negligence cannot be asso-
ciated with all hunters.

Stupid sport, Mr. Travers? I can
think of more ridiculous sports.
How about golf‘? Does it make sense
to hit a little ball, chase after it, hit it
again, lose it, find it and attempt to
put it into a little hole?

It may seem cruel, but by killing a
deer, a family who cannot afford to
eat meat every night can, depending
on the size of the deer. Let’s face it:
Due to survival of the fittest, many
deer will starve this winter. Doesn’t
it. make more sense ‘to shoot the
overpopulation and use it for food
than to let the weak deer starve and
decay in a cornfield? (Please don’t
tell me it makes good fertilizer.)

Personally, I don’t think Mr.
Travers has his act together and is
just trying to make an asinine point.

J. Scott Brodbeck
CAS Pre-Pharmacy

I felt compelled to reply to Mr.
Bob Traver's article “The Sporting
Life” in The Pitt News (Sept. 30,
I985) about awakening at 5:30 in the
morning at 20 below zero to go out
and kill helpless deer.

Personally I have been hunting
for about six years with my father
and uncle, and ljust had to point out
a few things thatjust aren’t true. For
example, what would happen if
nobody went out and killed those
poor helpless deer? Now, Mr. Trav-
ers, there are about 500,000'deer in
the state of Pennsylvania after
hunting season is over, and before
the season I would estimate there is a
population of about 750,000 deer.
Now, Mr. Travers, can you guess
what would happen if there were no
hunting season? Would you go out
and spend your hard-earned money
to feed these deer? Or would you let
them starve to death? Now, which is
more humane — instant death by a
bullet or" the agony of the weeks it
takes to watch your insides rot away

and be so weak that you can’t walk,
but just roll over and die?

I think that you have this “Bambi
and Thumper” perspective on hunt-
ing, that all hunters are murderers,
killers and impassionate slobs. The
“hunt” is not a bunch of killers using
submachine guns to kill bucks. It is a
harvest to make the deer population
healthy, to weed out the sick and
injured animals that shouldn’t sur-
vive for the next year. .

    

P57

K‘

Another thing that you failed to "

point out in your article is that the
Pennsylvania hunting license per-
mits only the harvest of bucks.(male
deer). You seem to have this idea
that hunters go out to kill anything
in sight for their sadistic pleasure.
True, there is a very small minority
of slobs who have no concern for
anything they see, but if they get
caught by the game warden with a
field-dressed doe without a doe
license, (doe licenses are issued when
the herd of does goes beyond their
limit) they are faced with fines
approaching $5,000 and loss of
license for five years.

Another reason why people hunt
is for food. Do you know how many
steaks, roasts and chops can be had
from a 175 lb. buck? Enough to feed
a family of four for a whole winter.
A lot of people in Pittsburgh don’t
have jobs and do have families.
Some of these people are on welfare
and need to go hunting every year. It
amazes me, Mr. Travers, that you
can ask the question, Why do people
go hunting? Do you know how
much it would cost to maintain the

deer 'herd in Pennsylvania without

hunting for one year? Probably

more than three years‘ of your

father's salary.

Education

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

Solving U.S. trade problems with
Japan is necessary for lessening the
U.S. trade deficit, according to Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh President Wes-
ley Posvar. Posvar attended the
Business-Higher Education Forum
held in Pittsburgh on Thursday and
Friday of last week.

“The problem of U.S. trade bal-
ance requires urgent action,” Posvar
said. “The basic problem is Japan. If
we can improve our problem in
trade with Japan, everything else
would fall into place.”

The Business-Higher Education
Forum is an organization of deans
and faculty of American universities
and corporate executives. They meet
and discuss economic and educa-
tional issues, giving recommenda-
tions to federal agencies.

In 1983, the Forum submitted a
report to President Reagan which
called for an effort to improve U.S.
industry. The meetings last week in
Pittsburgh also addressed the issue

of U.S. international competiveness.

forum seeks
(1.8. trade relations with Japan

“We now have a worldwide marketplace which is
quite different now than it was five years ago--one in
which everyone is interdependent”

—Dr. Posvar

“This is a national organization,
and the meeting here reﬂects the fact
that Pittsburgh is the focus of strong
leadership in American business and
in American education," Posvar
said.

Posvar, a member of the organi-
zation, outlined the Forum’s plan to
combat the trade deficit:

0A federal department of trade
should be implemented to unify the
fragmented system now dealing with
foreign trade.

0The rules governing trade need
to be better enforced.

0Access to information between
nations trading must be increased,
and this would lead to a reduction in
dumping of goods.

0Education needs to be improved
in international studies and business
in American universities.

“We now have a world-wide mar-
ketplace which is quite different
than it was five years ago in which
everyone is interdependent,” Posvar
said.

Posvar, however, said these poli-
cies will have no immediate effect on
Pitt programs.

“This is dealing with the problem
at the most ‘general national level,
and it doesn’t relate specifically to
Pitt,” he said, “except to the call for
more international teaching, and we
have a very strong program in Inter-
national Studies. And our School of

. Business is moving into interna-

tional trade relations.

“In the universities we need more
international education and foreign
language training,” he continued.
“In business schools we need more
programs having to deal with inter-
national trade.”

A crowd of Pirate fans swarms Forbes Field after Bill Mazeroski’s legendary winning home run

mg’ '

-""’:“"‘!ii"n.«

By Mark Kenny
For The Pitt News

On Oct. 13. 1960, Bill Mazeroski
stepped up to the plate at Forbes
Field in Oakland. It was the bottom
of the ninth inning in the last game
of the World Series, and the Pitts-
burgh Pirates were tied with Casey
Stengel‘s New York Yankees 9-9.

The fans were on their feet as Yan-
kee pitcher Ralph Terry’s first pitch
crossed the plate, high. The second
pitch, a slider, came in right across
the letters. Mazeroski, a stocky
second baseman, swung.

At the crack of the bat, Yankee
fielder Yogi Berra started moving
back toward the ivy-colored outfield
wall. He never raised his glove but
watched as the ball sailed over the
left field wall.

As Mazeroski rounded third and
headed for home plate, the fans
poured onto the field. The Pirates
won 10-9, and Mazeroski’s home
run became a Pittsburgh legend.

Today, almost 25 years since that
Series-winning home run, Forbes
Field exists only in fragments and
memories.

In its place is the University of
Pittsburgh Forbes Quadrangle, a
massive, five—story building which is

equal in area to the Cathedral of.

Forbes Field, however, was billed
as the largest baseball field in the
world at it’s opening day on June 30,
1909. Newspaper accounts of that
day described in detail and with
barely contained pride the splendor
of the occasion and the luxury of the

-new field.

The seven-acre ballpark, which
required only four months to com-
plete, boasted a two-tiered grand-

stand that was built to fit the Pirates‘

like a snug baseball cap.

lts‘hard-packed infield and close- .

cropped outﬁeld favored the Pirate‘s
style of hitting, while its tauntingly
distant center field wall, at 457 feet,
allowed few home runs by opposing
teams.

The fans, all 30,338 of them,
jammed the aisles that opening day
and watched their beloved Bucca-
neers lose to the Chicago Cubs 3-2.

The fervor ofthat opening say was
not dimmed by the score, however,
as the pride which fans had in the
Pittsburgh-financed, Pittsburgh-
built stadium, and in such players as
the legendary Honus Wagner, car-
ried over into the following seasons.

Over the years,,the field played

Actress Celeste Holm criticizes modern theater

By Thomas Danyluk
For The Pitt News

Oscar-winning actress Celeste
Holm seemed to successfully charm
a small but responsive audience in
the Kresge Theatre of Carlow Col-
lege last Thursday.

Holm’s lecture, the first in a three-
part series being presented by the
school, was plainly entitled ‘-‘Theatre
and the Arts,” but it proved to be
more than an objective description
of the relationship. between the two.
She quickly captured the crowd with
a string of subtle yet witty remarks,
and then proceeded into her lecture,
a humorous account of her glamor-
ous life. ,

She began by telling of her early
childhood, of the days in Paris
where she studied to be a ballet

“In today ’s industry, there is no consideration for the
audiences sense of value. The producers in Holly-
wood and Broadway are basically concerned with
money. Television today is a power play, a struggle
for position and wealth among performing entities. ”

— Celeste Holm

 

dancer. As the ship swayed on her
family's return to the United States,
so did -her interests. She became
“utterly fascinated with acting and
drama,” and after numerous perfor-
mances in small-scale plays, she
auditioned for a part in the then-
unknown Rodgers and Hammer-
stein musical, “Oklahoma.” Her

respect and numerous roles in a wide

films include “The Snake Pit,” “The

Oscar.

Presently, she is an active member

of several art councils and a perma-
nent board member for the National
Mental Health Association.

Although Holm’s lecture was cen-
tered largely around her life story,
she did inject her opinions on several
controversial issues. One of her
more interesting comments was on
the present state of the theater and
film industries and their relative
effect on actors.

Holm strongly criticized present-
day producers and directors for their
avaricious motives and failure to‘
deliver high-quality entertainment
toithe public.

“In today's industry, there is no
consideration for the audiences
sense of value,” said Holm. “The
producers in Hollywood and on
Broadway are basically concerned
with money. Television today is a

power play, a struggle for position
and wealth among non-performing
entities.” She hinted that the present
situation is all but irreversible. “The
golden days of ‘Broadway are gone
forever," she said.

Despite her gloomy outlook of the
theater industry, she stressed that
the ‘general public can change what -

' they view on television. “This is done

not by boycotting programs, but by
an outright refusal to purchase the
products of television sponsors, and
in turn, letting the television produc-
ers know about it.“

Holm stated that if she was to
relive her life in today’s society, she
has doubts on her becoming an
actress again “because it isn’t worth
it. There are too many deterrents,
and theater is a business now, not
just an art form.”

the offense the ball on the South

field goal kicker Pat Viancourt,
whose attempt sailed wide right.
The crowd of 37,277 groaned as
once again the offense failed to
score from- the 20 yard line.
“We were a little down after '
that happened, but we didn't
want to dwell on it and not feel
like we can do it because we
know that we can,” said quarter-
back John Congemi.

in Panther Victory

Pitt emerged from its 42-7 demoli-
tion of South Carolina a bit banged
up. Pitt head .coach Foge Fazio will
find himself a bit shallow at tight
end. Starting tight end Clint Wilson
sprained his right knee in the second

- half of Saturday’s game. Wilson, a

‘senior from Pahlokee, Fla., caught
two passes for 29 yards before leav-
ing the game in the third quarter.
Wilson is listed as doubtful for this
Saturday’s game against North
Carolina.

Sophomore tight end Dave
Shuck, Wilson’s backup, is expected
to miss four to six weeks after frac-
turing his collarbone in the third
quarter of Saturday’s game. Shuck,
a native of Dunbar, Pa., caught two
passes for 15 yards against South
Carolina. He is the second member
of Panther quarterback John Con-
gemi’s receiving corps to go down
with a broken collarbone. Matt
Stennett, ajunior from Shaler, went
down earlier with the same injury.
He is also expected to be out
indeﬁnitely.

Bobby Lawson, a senior from
Penn Hills, will see considerable
action should Wilson not be able to
go against North Carolina State.
Lawson caught one pass for,two
yards against South Carolina. It was
his only reception this season."

Pitt's defensive backfield took a
beating also, but not as bad as the
tight end position. Cornerback

Everybody got into the act as
Charles Gladman and Brian
Davis added on yard touchdown
runs to close out the scoring for
Pitt. The 42-7 victory raised their
record to 2-2-1 while South
Carolina fell to 2-3. Finally there‘
were some smiling faces in the
Pitt locker room. The defense
played another outstanding
game limitingthe Gamecocks to
I56 yards oftotal offense. Except
for a fluke play, theyshut out a
team that last year scored 45
points on them.

The encouraging aspect ofthis
game though is the performance
by the offence. They racked up
422 total yards. John Congemi
mixed his plays well, throwing to
the running backs and tight ends
in crucial situations. It was the
first time since the Purdue game
that the offense moved the ball
with regularity. ' '

Revenge: Memory of last year inspires Pitt   defense  

By Jim Brueclmer
Staff Writer

On June 19, 1936, Max Schmeling
met Joe Louis in Yankee Stadium.
Schmeling pummeled Louis merci-
Iessly with a surprise attack. Every
time Louis threw a left jab, Schmel-
ing would throw a looping right over
the top of it. These bombs resulted in
his knocking out Louis in 12 rounds.

On Oct. 14, 1984, Pitt met South
Carolina at Williams-Brice Sta-
dium. The SC offense launched an
attack at the Pitt defensive line in
much the same fashion (with similar
results) as that launched at Louis by
Schmeling. This attack came in the
form of long runs, long passes and
offensive firepower of all kinds, led
by quarterbacks Mike Hold and
Allen Mitchell. These ' bombs
resulted in a 45-21 knockout of Pitt.

On June 22, 1938, Louis finally
got his rematch with Schmeling.
Louis came storming out of his
corner and knocked out Schmeling
in the first round.

On Saturday afternoon, the Pitt
defensive line came storming out of
the trenches and knocked out SC in
the first quarter.

Pitt’s 14 points in the opening 15
minutes were enough for the victory
—— a victory that was due in large
part to the defensive line’s manhand-
ling of Hold and Mitchell. ‘

Revenge was on everyone’s mind.
“That’s all we’re talking about,”said

Walter Johnson. “You can see all of
the signs around here.” There were
many signs posted about the walls
of the locker room noting the tra-
vesty of last year’s encounter with
SC. One sign read, “Revenge for the
‘84 Embarrassment. Pitt 21 to 45.
Reverse this Bull----I”

Defensive end Tony Woods
agreed that the success of the defen-

sive line was due in large part to
being “fired up because of what SC
did to us last year.”

Coach Foge Fazio described the
team as “very intense  emotionally
high.” In fact, he did not feel that a
pre-game revenge pep talk was
necessary. “I think that they were
reminded themselves.”

Unfortunately for Hold, the
Panthers reminded themselves every
time that they hit the SC quarter-
back. When they were not sacking
him, the defensive line was nailing
Hold just as he was releasing a pass.

Hold should have known that he
was in for a bad day when on the first
play from scrimmage, he dropped
his first pass. On the first play of the
second drive, Hold tried a keeper
around the left end and was buried
by Woods, a man who would con-
tinue to inflict painful revenge on
him all day long. During SC’s third
possession, Hold was sacked twice,
first by Dennis Atiyeh and then by
Woods.

On the first play of SC’s next pos-
session, Hold was again hammered
for a loss by Woods. By this time,
Hold was, getting fed up with his
lousy protection and took matters
into his own hands. Two plays later,
Hold held the spotlight for a very
brief but very memorable time. It
was one of the most incredible plays
in gridiron history.

The Gamecocks had the ball on
their own 20-yard line. Hold
dropped back and was swarmed at
the 10-yard line by a host of Pan-
thers led by Woods, who appeared
to be just about to sack Hold when
he stopped. Woods later admitted,
“I had a clear shot at him, but I
thought I heard a whistle so I slowed
up. Then he started scrambling, and
all chaos broke Ioose.”

Hold escaped to the left, broke
another tackle and spun backward.

He faded back again, this time to the
2-yard line, where he stood looking
downfield. Another rush came and
he faded further back, into the end
zone where he was almost dropped
for a safety. Scrambling again to the
right, he took the form of a punt,
pass and kick competitor by getting
a running start from two yards deep
in the end zone and running out to
the 4-yard line where he threw a des-
peration pass downﬁeld — anything
to get away from that rush.

As the ball came down at mid-
field, three Panthers and SC running
back Anthony Smith converged on
the ball. Somehow the ball found its
way through the crowd and hit
Smith, bouncing off his chest. As SC
running back Raynard Brown came

by, the ball popped right into his '

hands, and he took it down the mid-
dle of the field untouched for an
unbelievable 80-yard touchdown.

The play reminded Fazio of
Franco Harris’ Immaculate Recep-
tion, but it proved to be the only
bright spot for Hold all day. On the
next SC possession, Pitt’s defensive
line was back for revenge as Walter
Johnson sacked Hold second down.
Hold was again sacked on the subse-
quent play as he unloaded the ball.
SC’s next possession saw only one
play from scrimmage as a fierce rush
had Hold running for his life. As he
threw the ball away to avoid another
sack, Hold was intercepted by Teryl
Austin.

On their last possession ofthe first
half, Hold was sacked by Walter
Johnson. A few plays later as he
completed a pass, Hold was nailed
again as he released the ball. On the
last two offensive plays, Hold was
sacked by Woods and again pum-
meled by Johnson as he threw a
pass.

Hold did not return for the second
half.

Mitchell received a king’s treat-
ment compared to Hold, but one can
be sure that he did not enjoy it.

After a peaceful first possession,
Mitchell was hit by Johnson, which
resulted in Mitchell’s throwing the
ball to Steve Apke for an intercep-
tion. The next possession ended as
Jon Carter dropped Mitchell for a

14-yard loss. The Panthers spared
no one.

Mitchell received only one chance
from scrimmage in SC’s first fourth
quarter possession. As he was again

sacked by Johnson, Mitchell was
this time intercepted by Austin.

Austin, who had two intercep-
tions for the day, was thankful for
the strong play of the defensive
front. “We like that,” he said. “They
keep the pressure on, and it’s hard
for him to stand there and pick out
the receivers. If we keep them
covered for the first few seconds, he
can’t complete the passes.”

‘ A later sack by Bob Schilken was
the icing on the cake.

The whole defensive line played
more at the level of former Pitt All-
America Hugh Green. Woods was
the outstanding performer in a day
of stellar performances by the defen-
sive line. Woods and Fazio both
called it the best game of his college
days. Fazio later compared Woods
to possibly being another Rickey
Jackson.

— revenge.
