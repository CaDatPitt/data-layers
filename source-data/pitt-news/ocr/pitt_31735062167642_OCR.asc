I page 2—'mE PITT NEWS—Monday, October 27, 1969
 "  “ by MICHAEL EDELSTEIN
Staff Writer

Time magazine described a “mystical quality” in James Meredith.
.What ‘they probably referred to is Meredith’s aura of sincerity, a
’product of his constant maintanence of eye contact during conversation
= and his inability to spurt smooth, simple, artificial-sounding solutions to
complex questions. . The leader of the National Community
Improvement Association seemed most concerned about the latter, as
he. began the hour-long interview with this comment, “What really
‘4-disappoints me is 36 years of discussion and almost nothing that I have
N4 ever tried to express is understood. . . . We got a real had problem; the
N ._ b1acks‘don’t have a language. We speak English in America, but it’s not
the same thing. . . . We can only communicate what’s basic to the
dominant group in our society.”

Question: Do you thing this will ever change?

, » Answer: Yea, if we get enough power to change it  . before you
i‘ , change the world you have to change that which is closest to you. . . .
This is what has not happened with blacks. . . . You have to get to your
own soul first.

Q.: How can this be done?

 A.: “Everything I do is primarily aimed at building the backbone of
 Negro men . . . niggers are scared of white folks, especially a Negro
 man is scared of a white man. Until one will admit this, one can take no
 ‘action to do anything about it Much of my activities in the last 36 years

has been really aimed at making the black man really see himself, to pit
him against his son. Most black men have to tell their sons that don’t
-‘ have the courage I do . . . he may make his son scared too. -. . .
“ Ultimately I know we’ve got to fight,, I mean no freedom’s ever been
 obtained any other way. Before you can fight you’ve got to have
 potential soldiers to draw from.”

- Q.: What will be the focus, themeans and objectives of your fight?
.’ A.: “The same ones the American revolution used.”
 : Freedom, autonomy. . .?
2 Whatever you call it. You name it; you find it.” I
: In other words, it would just be a revol . . . l
: Purely American.
: Would it be violent?
: Purely American . . . whatever’s American. _
- ' Q.: Is it possible for blacks and whites to share legitimacy within a
white culture?
A.: Yes, but it’s not possible in this culture. . . . Western civilization

A is built on a dual system of separating human beings and the measure is
race._ ’ ’ '

,. Q.: Do you agree with William Buckley when he said these words in
a" column about you in October 23, 1962, National Review, “The Negro
will be truly emancipated only because the white man and the Negro
have reached a new level of understanding and mutual respect; not .
because, in 1954, the justices of the Supreme Court decided to bestow
upon their subjects a brand new natural right.”

LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT

.=The question of abolition of lan— --
guage as a formal requirement
has arisen. again in the College of
Arts , and Sciences. ' Since this '
question has many implications

on in terms of a lieberal arts educa-

A.. “It’s typical Buckley. . . . He didn’t rea ly say anything, but it
sounded conservative. . . . In a real nutshell what he say was ‘Whatever
is going to happen to black people is going to be determined by whites.
And, of course, with that I have to take very serious issue.”

Q.: In another article, Buckley discusses the question of whether the
whole south bears responsibility for your being shot during the 1966
march or, as Buckley thinks, this was an action by one man, a “kama-
kaze freak.” What do you think? .

A.: Man, the truth is that the south in all its -viciousness is nowhere
near the north . . . the real killing’s done by the north.

Q.: Are government poverty programs doing any good?

A.: These programs serve two purposes: they ameliorate, at least
temporarily, the racial question, and quiet it. The man reason is . . . to
provide . . . money. . . to pay off political hackies.” '

Q.: Who did you support in the 1968 Presidential election?
A.: Nixon.
Q.: Are you satisfied now with your choice?

A.: I’m satisfied . . . I supported him for two reasons. Primarily to
keep Wallace from becoming the determining factor in domestic policy,
not because Wallace is a bad man, but because of the thing he was riding
in front of. And to stop the liberal thing Humphrey was head of.

Q.: Why did you want to stop that? A
A.: Because I think it is most detrimental to the future of this coun-

 

"try, most particularly the future of blacks in this country . . . I favor the

liberal politically. . . . Humphrey was also a liberal as related to the
racial thing (and it is this)‘, I’m violently opposed to. All they really are
are power brokers. He wnats to move between the blacks and the real
power structure. He wants to offer the blacks something, better and he
wants to offer the power structure tranquility.

Q.: What is the conservative tyring to offer?
A.: If you’re talking about the white liberal with regards to the

racial question there is no conservative that would oppose that. . . .'

When you remove the so-called white liberals, then you’ve got two
things left, the real power and the mass to deal with each other. And this
is where I think the action is . . . anytime you use a broker there won’t be
any basic change. . . . The white liberal would say, “All right, in
Witcheta Falls, Texas, the deputy sheriff has the right to hit a black 16
times with his blackjack, so now we’re going to reduce that to eight. So
everybody is better off. The blacks won’t be quite so mad cause they’re
not getting his as many times . . . and the whites will be pacified cause

’ they’re still hitting. . . . I’d rather have the possibility of having 16 blows

or none to anything in between.”

Q.: You surprised me when you said, “George Wallace isn’t a bad
man.”

A.: There isn’t a politician north of the Mason-Dixon line that’s as
good a man as George Wallace.

Q.: That still isn’t a compliment.

A.: Of course, not. It’s not a kick at Wallace either. The particular
thing that Wallace used to promote’ his political interests is bad . . . a
successfulWallace' campaign in ’68 would have been bad. But in the
future this ain’t necessarily so . . . Wallace never advocated one
program as adverse to the blacks as what the Nixon administration’s
putting across. ‘The same people who supported Wallace supported
McCarthy . . . and Goldwater, ..  . they want to find a. place in society to
exercise power, and they don’t‘5‘are who it’s with. The only way Wallace
would ever win is by capturing a Democratic primary.

Q.: Ccould something like this ever happen with somone thsblacks

channels. ‘~ -

Promotes
Self-Interest

by BILL GORMLEY
Staff Writer

(See Analysis, Page 3)

James Meredith, who achiev-
ed notoriety in 1962 when he in-
tegrated the University of Missis-
sippi, welcomed the support of
whites if prompted by a sense of
self—interest, but spurned bene-
volence unaccompanied by ulter-
ior motives, in an address on Oct.
23. “I think white support is a
wonderful thing when it is done in
the interest of white people,”
Meredith told a midday audience.

“If I were a white man,” he hy-
pothesized, ‘‘I wouldn’t give up
my superior position unless I
though I had to.” Accordingly,
Meredith believes he must,con-
Vince" whites that change is in-
deed necessary. “I have to con-
vince white people that it’s im-
possible any other way,” he main-
tained- ~

Making his point clearer, Mere-
dith dramatically rejected a white
student’s expression of support.

' “I don’t need you,” he told the stu-

dent. “I’m telling you to take care
of your own interests. If you do, I

Paul K rassne

(Cmrtimwrl from Pay? 

cago Conspiracy with his informa-
tive opinion on drugs and the
"system."

After casually stating that he
had the probable distinction of be-
ing the only person to appear on
the Johnny Carson show tripping
on acid (“You should have seen
all the colors in Ed McMahon's
face.” ). and affirming that the US
is in Southeast Asia "to protect
the marijuana crops." Krassner,
in his sporadic style, delved into
the relationship between drugs
and the system.

Religion and Sex

He put down some general
statements about drugs and the
church and drugs in sexual rela-
tionships. .

Krassner on drugs and reli-
gion: _

“Membership in the church has
been going down in inverse pro-
portion to the rise in the -use of
drugs.”

Krassner on drugs and sex:

“Drugs heighten the sense, in-
cluding the sense of touch, so they
would tend to heighten sexual re-
lationships. ”

Then he spoke _more specifical-

ly on drugs in politics and in life‘

styles. He stated that the New
Left Movement was originally
against dope because members
thought is was a “CIA plot to get
people out -f political protest.”
Later, they found out that the
drugs and protest were “not mu-
tually exclus/ive.”

Politics and the Drug Scene

Two political “by-products”

arose from drug arrests, explain-
ed Krassner. One was that some
people began to see that “law and
order has nothing to do with mor-
ality and justice.” Arrests were
also a “vehicle for insight.” New
leftists, said Krassner, saw that

 

« PAUL KRASSNER

“all institutions are arbitrary,"
and that smoking grass was akin
to “an act of civil disobedience.

“More people in SDS realized
that there is no separation with
personal and political life—poli-
’.cs were the way you live.” And
so was born the “coalition of
heads and political activists.”

Meanwhile, in Chicago during
the Democratic convention,
Krassner and Abbie Hoffman
were forming the Youth Interna-
tional Party (Yippie). It was.
more or less. a put-on. Krassner
said that they wanted to trick the
“hungry” media into thinking
‘that they were politically organ-
ized. Their real desire for Chi-
cago was “a Woodstock" without
the mud.” They wanted a “party”
of communion and friendship that
erased the boundaries of whether
one chose to march" on the .con-
vention or stay in the Park. “We
wanted to communicate the feeling
of solidarity. Whether we walked
or not, we all were on the same
side.”
“Do You Own Thing”
Krassner is an advocate of the
today philosophy and of “doing
your own thing.” After his loosely-
structured speech, questions led
him to elaborate on that philoso-
phy and violence.

Monday, October 27, 19li9—'mE PITT NEWS—Page3  I

BASHMERES    

r--------------

If you do your own thing, where
does it end? “I don’t knowwhere

' the line is between freedomiand

insanity.” Krassner answered.
Perhaps. he said, it’s in “fore-
sight" and knowing the conse-
quences of your act. He mention-
ed the idea of not interfering with

others doing their own thing, but-

added that interfering with the
stability of others. is an individual
decision.

When asked about the revolu-
tion to change the system, Krass-
ner emphasized his philosophy:
"I can’t tell you what to do. Play
the games you’re best at. . . .
Ideally. there would be no vio-
lence in bringing about change.”
But frustration with the system,
he claimed, leads to inevitable
violence. He cited Eldridge Cleav-
er who stated that “revolution is
the ultimate form of self-defense.

Krassner was only half-joking
when he said, “I have two revolu-
tionary slogans—‘God will punish
the bad guys’ and ‘Que sera,

_i_-According to Webster, de-
{mocra_cy means “government by
’tl1‘epeople.’-’ Given such a defini-
tion,-i it is virtually impossible to
9-.deny that Pete Flaherty is a bona
Vfidedemocrat. Since he became
,.a' candidate for mayor, the 44-
igyear-old city councilman has ar-
’gued,in favor of “returning the
mayor’s office to the people.”

2 Addressing a group at the Uni-
-versity Tuesday night, Mr. Flah-
Terty, reiterated this theme. “I
want the Democratic Party to be
-?controlled by the people,” he de-
. fclared, ,“not‘by‘a handful of in-
, dividuals at the top.” Throughout
."the' campaign, the slender lawyer
jphas attacked that handful, the
 powerful Democratic Policy Com-
«;mittee, which for vears has con-
@trolled the selection of Pitts-
 jburgh’s officials. ‘
 If ' elected, the maverick De-
_, mocrat will abolish the Policy
I 1, Committee and substitute an open
primary system. In this way, he
~ ,would make real the central mes-_
“sage ‘of the gospel he has been
7. preaching.

“Let the people decide, even
, if they make mistakes occasional-
‘_-7- .  ly,”,Mr. Flaherty exhorts, always
‘, adding that he does not think
_'they will err frequently.

 “ Although some have accused
. Mr.‘.Flaherty of sounding the cry
','_fpower,to the people”’ in order
‘ to get votes, I am convinced he
 is-'a, democrat by conviction and
‘Ta full-fledged one at that. How-
4- ever, having dismissed the charge
, that “Pete’s a phony,” it seems’
‘necessary, in my opinion, to ask
e whether in fact democracy is per- _
*-'ferable to a mixed system of pop-
, « ular and elitist rule.

_ " '.  The notion of democracy is too
i often taken for granted. The ba-
I  sis of its worth is rarely question-
" ed or explained. “What America
%‘'needs .are leaders to match the
 wisdom of her people,” Richard
Nixon declaimed during last year’s
. Presidential Campaign. Was this
A-_ mere oratory or did it reflect our_
I .. President's sincere belief?

 dent Nixon and Councilman Flah-
_./‘erty profoundly admire and respect
, _the American people. However, I
;’would, also maintain that their
7-faith in the people’s judgment is -
-glargely unjustified. From my per-

spective, America’s masses are
neither especially intelligent nor
particularly enlightened. They
are, as a whole, uninformed, unin-
terested, uninspired, and over-
rated. - ’ '

Furthermore, the people are
easily swayed by dubious factors.
Undoubtedly, the Kennedys owed
their tremendous popularity I as
much to theirgood looks as to

their intellects. In The Sellingof .

the President, 1968, Joe McGin-
iss describes the extentto which
Nixon aides utilized Madison
Avenue techniques in order to
shape their candidate's image
and win votes. -

Recently, I spent an entire day
interviewing Pittsburgh voters’ in
the privacy of their homes,.ask-A
ing for ‘their analysis of the
’city’s problems and their opinions
of the two candidates for mayor. I
was appalled by the scarcityof
knowledge, shallowness of ob-
servations, and intrusions of pre-
judice which I found. The very
idea of entrusting the city’s fate
to the massescaused me to shud-
der.

-1 do not shrink from asserting
that an elite group of well-educa-
ted, knowledgeable individuals is
better equipped to determine the

‘ relative merits of political as-

pirants than the people at large. ’

The Democratic Policy Com-
mittee of Allegheny County, al-
though it does not exactly measure '
ure up to the above standards, is
capable of choosing officials
more wisely than P'ittsburgh’s
masses. ‘ ~

However, if the Democratic
Policy Committee is more ca-
pable of wisdom than the vot-
ers of Pittsburgh, it is also. less
likely to act wisely. Unfortunately,
an elite tends to be both more in-

-telligent and more prone to self-

ishness,’a power-related disease,
than the masses. Thus, the elite,
while in a better position to know
the truth, is also more likely to
veer off the path -of righteous
conduct.

In the final analysis, therefore,
I am forced to agree with the
late Winstron Churchill. “Demo'-
cracy is the worst form of gov-
ernment devised’ by‘ man.” The
thoughtful statesman admitted,
“except for all the others tried.”
Best wishes to Pete Flaherty and
the people of Pittsburgh! '

Do They Know What Peace Is 

by JOE IBLASI

“Men of the Moritorium, I hon-
or and love you, but I shall obey
peace rather than you. While
. I have life and strength It shall
never ‘cease from the practice
and teaching of Peace.” '

Adopted from the Apology of
Socrates

_ (Writer's Note: It was ,very in-
novent, very novel. I called
WPGH on Tuesday evening to say
that i would be there’ and I
would march, but peace was more
than this. I said it was a deep

transformation in man, in us. He "

get upset. He said something
about death and University re-
search programs. He said it must
end. I agree with him, but there
ISmore.....) I

IT HAS been the stock and trade
_of ,many civilizations _.to throw
their evil somewhere, faraway.’ It
may seem pleasant . and re-
lieving to project all that we hate
away from ourselves in the tradi-
tion of our beat medicine men
and witch hunters. I‘ believe that
the'Vietnam Moratorium can be a
narrow experience for us, because

— "of this. It is both difficult and de- V

cisive for some people to parti-
cipate in such’ a movement. For
those who do and for those who
do not "or would not, it is not
enough. Much is lacking.

Peace is not wholly _a matter of
movements, marches,‘ buttons,
armbands, and moratorium,
and it does_ not follow that if
one has marched, one is for
peace. Note -that the Man did

. not say, “Blessed are the arm-
bands, marches andbeads of the
dissenters.” He said, “Blessed-
are the peacemakers.” This is
our challenge. This must. be inte-
grated with the Vietnam Mora-
torium. _ '

No Peace Ahead?

When we survey the ruin we
have made of half the world, we
cannot feel peace within, and as

’ we look to the path before us, we
are chilled by the thought that
there may be no peace ahead. Our

extremity necessitates that we
be -radicals concerning peace, re-
volutionaries for peace, and dis-_
senters to all that is “dark.and
waring. ' . ' H

There is no time to sit’ back;
there is hardly even time to
wonder. But especially, this ex-
tremity allows no room for feel-
ers, little concessions, and un-
touchable‘ longings. We cannot

' settle the strife by making Viet-

nam the witch, and embarking

‘ on«a wild hunt. We cannot afford,

to be so unrealistic and super-

.morrow, but so long as we tol_er

hate within ourselves. more and
more Vietmans will spring up in
places that we least expect.

so cunning, so cynical, so biting,
so right, so wonderful. We will
walk miles for an end to the Viet-

The campus YMCA has started a program of draft counsel-

Students have been trained to help people understand the
complexities, of the draftlaw. Constant contact is maintained
with other _couns_eling agencies in Pittsburgh for expert advice
and information on the constantly changingdraft law. '

These Pitt students have been especially trained to deal with
problems arising from college deferements.

All men are urged to contact the Y for counseling as it is of-

Invitation of Peace

This rebirth of peace can only

come about through continual
openness and attention to the In-.

vitation of -Peace in every situa-

tion in our lives (Military - In- ’

dustrial, Personal, Interpersonal,
Economic,‘ Political . .) The

N‘ Invitation is to deeply transform

on every level, to cut ourselves
away from what is jaded, cramp-
ed, shoddy,’stunted, piecemeal,

sham, maudlin, and phony - and 

to give ourselves fully and with-

out reserve to peace, love, hope, _

honesty, and-beauty.

It will beghard, and things to: ..

which we have become attach-

ed will have to be left behind," ’

for the man who gives himself to
somethingbigger than himself is
avante garde, an explorer, a
pioneer. Denial will have to come,
as strongly as we demand it on
the Military-Industrial level.

THIS PROMISE of rebirth
weighs heavily upon us, yet it is

V joyful and full of wonder and

life. It should make us uncomfor-
table as we make the Establish-

_ ment uncomfortable. It should de-

"mand changes, for peacemust be
to us as a two-edged sword: one
defend and the other to cut out
the phoniness and hypocrisy.

I encouirage all those interest-
ed in the ‘Moratirium not to be
narrow and Establish Themselves

— Within, for, in -this, they, or ra-

ther we, create the very civil we

rants a continual with to destroy.
Peace truly warrants a continual
turning over of our hearts — I"
commend, to ‘you meditation —
an openness to all people and‘
all situationsxon all levels —- I say

you gain littlesuccesses -— and an

ability to "change our hearts I
hope we can encourage one an-

other not to hold on tightly to
what is phony. What is» false in’
us will ‘yet betray us.’ May
peace andpeace be everywhere!

It seems unfortunateithat the

and my committee will devote
myself to grabbing every bit of in-

list of non-negotiable, self-perpe-

1. That trusteee meetings be
held in Pitt Stadium to accommo-
date my teeming millions of sup-

and awarded to the concerned stu-
dent» withthe longest curly locks
(women not included).

3. That the minutes of all con-
cerned students meetings be made
available and printed with appro-
priate editorial applause in The
Pitt News. (This demand is al-
ready in the process of being ful-

filled, but is hampered by the pre- ,

sence of uncomplimentary report-
ing in other University publica-
tions and cannot be realized until
opposition views are entirely sup-
pressed.) -

5. That- Ken Schueler be lifted
from his non-officialustlatus‘ and be
made Official Pitt News Mascot—~

which is the bureaucratic bull we
keep hearing about in editorials.

If these proposals are carried
out, they cannot help but promote
my own personal prestige, and my
power is, of course, the very es-
sence of student power.

' '4 . Lester Drentluss

Editor, The Pitt News:

Once again rampant ignorance
of some very fundamental con-
cepts inspires me to try to clue
some people into what’s really
happening here, especially with
regard to the nature of the police
state. We are, of course, now liv-
ing in one, but have really always

. lived in once.

The two main reasons why we
were never able to see it are: (1)
We were continually taught that it
can’_t happen here; and (2) There
are only few instances when large
groups ever really disagreed in
this country. Doesn’t it seem a bit
odd that this country should re-

quire all 200,000,000 of us to think
and act alike? . .

Anyway, on those few occa-
sions, as during the union disputes
of the early 1900’s, the socialist
reaction to the Depression, and
the Civil Rights programs of the
late 1950’s and early 1960’s, the
police" were quite merciless.
Therefore, there-is no reason to
be surprised over the Pentagon,

Chicago, Detroit, ‘People’s Park,

San Francisco State, Black Pan-
ther offices, Harlem, or the Pitts-
burgh Moratorium.

The people in this country are
quite.psychotic, for lots of rea-

‘sons. ‘One of the main reasons is

that they live in a continual state  
of blissful illusion, a bastardized 1:‘; 
high, if you will. What is a police?

state? Is it police breaking down,
your door unannounced in the mid-'0
dle of the night for dubious rea-
sons, i.e.. Drug busts, the chur‘ch°
raid in Chicago last week? Is it: 
incarceration without fair legal; f

procedure for political purpose,

juries, all male juries, all middle ;   ‘
class juries, all geriatric juries?  . 
Is it police interference with the”-_' 
freedom of dissent and the free- 
dom of press, i.e. refusal of march I‘ :5 ‘ "1;-1
permits, ‘confiscation of film fol-* 
lowing threats of bodily injury, 

“guidelines” for TV coverage of"

political events? Is it- police ter-

rorism and police brutality? It is if
all of these things, of human, 
thought and action through the in-- r 
duction of fear. It is mass control.  157
It is mass robotization. That’s "f

Cecil B irt: Evolution

by DON MARBURY
News Editor
More than a year ago one of the

most controversial groups ever to
be initiated on the University cam-

pus was initiated. It’s name, the_

Black Action Society (BAS). With’
its coming also appeared a new
type of student on campus; the

' awakened black person.

One of the finest examples of
today’s black young men, is Cecil
Birt, senior history major and one
of the dominant opinion factors in
the University’s BAS. Typical of

many black students, Birt des-
. cribed his reason for going to col-
' lege as an attempt to “gather all

the relevant knowledge I can, and
use it to help my people.”

Cecil originally attended Tem-
ple University in Philadelphia, af-
ter graduating from Aliquippa
High School in 1965, but he soon
transferred after 'a years stay,
because of Temple’s rigid ‘require-
ments. “I guess I'went to Phil-
adelphia,” Cecil said, “chasing
some sort of dream of what col-

, lege should be like.”

After transferring to Pitt he
said his whole attitude about him-
self, his mission in life, and what
it ureaps to be black in a white
world started waging conflict
within his mind.

He recounted one instance,
when his white roommate, whom
he said had seemingly been his
friend through high school moved

I out on him, behind a host of false

charges. “He finally came"out and
said that the reason he wanted to
move out was that he couldn’t live
with a black’ dude, rationalizing
that this was the way he was
brought up and that he couldn’_t

‘ " help himself,” Birt said.

Birt said that his reaction to

‘this was pretty apathetic but that

it brought into focus many of the
racist things that existed in the
University.

“Then in the winter of 1966
Stokely Carmichael showed up on
campus and I went to hear him
talk,” he went on, and he said
things ‘like changing your whole
perception of yourself. He accus-

C . ed black people of being ‘little im-
' itation white men,’ and told us to

start looking at ourselves as be-

ing involved in the destinies of all .
black people.”

Birt attributes Carmichael’s
speech to awakening many of his
thoughts about himself.

After all these things ahd taken
place, Birt said he found, that he
couldfind no real purpose in tak-
ing many of his courses, and that

-he could not associate them with

 

5: Ipaige 6—THE,PITT NEWS—Monday, October 27, 1969

the problems plaguing the world
today. So in December of ’67 Ce-
cil flunked out of the University.

“At first I said to myself, fuck

it,” I'll go somewhere else,” he '

said, “but like that would have
meant that the University would
have defeated me; so I went to
see members of the administra-
tion.”

Birt said that one dean told him
to go see another dean, who in
turn told him to write to another
dean, who after commenting that
his letter was one of the most out-
standing he had ever read, still
did not do anything significant in
getting him reinstated.

“This was my first contact with
‘white bureaucracy,” he said, “and
I really began to identify with the
brothers and sisters on welfare,
who have to constantly pull on the
white man’s coat-tail.”

But finally in December of ’68
Cecil was reinstated, with the
stipulation that he had to at least
get a 3.0 QPA to get off probation. ',
“I put into my mind,” he said,
“that there was no way on earth
that I could get less than a 3.25,
because I knew that they really
didn’t want me back in." '

During the time Birt was out of
school, he said he read anything
that he could get his hands on like
Ellsion, Carmichael, Martin Lu-
ther King, and Satre. And when he
did get back into Pitt he was
shocked to find that there were
many black people who had like
himself been awakened to what it
meant to be black.

“But I began to see that black
movement turning into one big
‘hate whitey’ thing, and I realized
that black people do not have the
time or the effort for this. Black

. people must do what they do be-

cause of their love for black peo-
ple,” Birt said. “I was able to
formulate that the black man’s‘
position in our society was not due
to any faults of black people, but
in the sickness, and distortions in-
herent in our world,” he contin-
ued. t

Cecil said he listened to news
broadcasts and wondered why in
giving Vietnam casualty statis-
tics, announcers tried to make it
seem that one American life was
worth more than 10 Vietnames.
“I wondered,” he said, “just what
was so great about white life that
made it better than a yellow.”

Birt said he realized that the
American system fostered rac-
ism, exploitation, and tries to take
away a persons right to exist.

Outlining some of his thoughts
about black people and America,
he said that he does not believe
that Communism is the solution to
the world's problems, or Ameri-
can “capitalism.” .

‘‘I do believe though, he con-
tinued “that each person must

have a‘ commitment to-other peo-

ple and what happens to them. It's
like that question we used to ask
each other when we -were kids
about if you had a, million dollars,
but you couldn’t spend it on any-
one else but yourself; what would
you do with it? You see the basis

of human existance is friendship '

and interdependancy?”

 
    
    
   
  

  

Birt said that his idealogy is not
centrally tied to any special one,
but that it has been influenced by
men such as ‘Castro, Cleaver,
Jones, King, Che and Karenga.

“As far as material wealth,” he
said, “the US is one of the great-
est in the world, but from an ana-
lytical pointof view, it is the weak-
est.”

He commented that the US is
now undergoing a moral decline,
which is historically characteris-
tic of the falling of an empire. '

“This decline began,” he went

.on, “when people came‘ to this

country and killed the Indians; a
genocide more complete and thor-

Of A Black Man

ought than Hitler ever dreamed
of.”

Commenting again on Ameri-
can life, Cecil said, “We have
John Birchers, Minutemen, and
Klansman walking the streets
spreading racism under the guise
of Americanism, and if that is
what America is all about, then I
say damn America.

Asked about the threat of geno-K33‘

cide on black people Birt com-
mented that the threat of death
was invalid to black people, be-
cause anything, death inclusive,
was better than what black people
have now.

“Our values are all fucked up,”
he said. concerning our society.
People were out in front of the Ca-
thedral begging for money for the
heart fund, which is an institution

.to save lives. But have you ever

seen anyone begging money for an
Anti-Ballistic Missile System?
You can get birth control pills
free, but I bet you couldn’t even
get a cold tablet free,” he said.

He said that white people’s role
in the black man’s struggle was
to-work on racism in their own
population, and them maybe hu-
manity won’t be pushed to the
point where black and white peo-
ple’s have to separate just to exist.

Concluding, Birt said, “Unless

some of the inequalities that exist
in this world are ironed out, there

. just aint going to be no world. All

power to all people, all power to
black people.”

of the BAS, and true Black man.

Anopen and free sound vibrates
ofn'524 SU as the new jazz band,
def‘ Nathan Davis’ direction,
‘practices, listens, and blends.'The
‘band is working on a today sound
with a heavy beat. By developing
a strong rhythm and a clear mel-
ofdy. line, the guys are sending
sounds that have a solid rhythmic
—-_me'ssage and a tighly- connected
sense of musicianship.

{The brass is clear and strong,
and tells quite a bit about youthful
vigor through their music. The
most refreshing thing about" this
group. is A its combined coordina-
_._tion and communication between
‘director and players. Their music
"is brought to life and to “now”
"through easy communication and
careful musicianship.

‘ Coordinated with the jazz band
"are singers and jazz dancers.

identity. Maloyd Wilson heads the
singers and he has written much
of the music that they will per-
form. Watch and listen for his
“Don’t Tell Me I Must Wait.”

The theme of “Afro Structural
Conceptions” is to portray struc-
tural beauty and its development
from primitive dancing to today's
liberated styles. The theme re-
volves around woman—her light-
ness, grace and freedom. The
score is divided into seven move-_
ments so that the dancers can ful-
ly interpret gradual structure
change.

‘Nathan Davis says that he and
his jazz band are blending main-
ly toward an “avant-garde rock
style, combining the blues revival
thing.” They'll be doing a lot of
things musically freer and newly
creative. The freedom in his
“Afro” is clearly stated through
themes that say yout'h,,dreams,
experiencing, and communicating.
The combined rock beats‘ and jaz-
zy Afro interludes express both
an awareness of today and a know-
ledge of musical style.

A small rock group from the
band may combine with the Uni-

engineers. So we’re technically 1 ' I  i

performances. The band has sev-
eral areas of abilities and possibil-
ities, and Nathan Davis intends
to develop as many as possible to
expose his band to various ways
of performing and learning. With
the capacity to blend into a unique
sound and to ‘make a heavy sound
real, Nathan Davis’ jazz band is
on its way to not only learning, but
giving—to those who listen.

Repeatedly disparaging the
white man’s potential role in im-
proving the status of blacks,
Meredith remarked, “I don’t think
my people will ever be free as

it’ll be because of their own ac-

he claimed,,‘.‘it wouldn’t matter

While condemning the white

fused to oppose violence as a tool

ly when Meredith proclaimed,
“We will have liberty even if we
have to kill the enemy’s leaders
and destroy the enemy’s strong-
holds in order to get it.” The ene-
my, from Meredith’s point of view,
is white Supremacy.

Reminiscing, Meredith explain-
ed why he applied to the Universi-
ty of Mississippi eight years ago
and described the experiences
which eventually led to his enroll-
ment. “I applied to Ole Miss,” he
recalled, “because it was sup-
posed to be a privilege reserved
for whites. I went there not to get
an education but to fight a war
against the enemy, white supre-

imacy.”

In addition to lashing out at
white supremacists, Meredith cri-
ticized’ “the enemy’s friends,”
who, in his opinion, “included
most of the blacks in Mississippi
in 1961.” Meredith emphasized
that be particularly resented the
insistence of other blacks that he
“project a proper image to please
white folks.” This‘ involved shav-
ing his beard and changing his

style of dress, concessions which

Meredith considered extremely
symbolic.

Throughout his speech, Mere-
dith referred to his “divine mis-
sion” and his feeling of “person-

-al responsibility to change the

status of my group.” Although he
refused to be specific, he hinted
that his concern may in fact stem
from the same sense of self-in-
terest, he hopes will eventually
prompt whites to work for the wel-
fare of black people. “The only
way an individual Negro can
change his status,” Meredith ‘con-

’ fided, “is to changepthe status of

thewhole group.”

WVU “Runs”

No Excuse, But...

By Martha. Hurtle

Sports Editor

It was about 45 minutes till game time as I walked
around Mountaineer Stadium admiring the new carpet of
Astro Turf. I was psyched for the game: I was confident
of a win.

Defensive coach Serafino “Foge” Fazio stopped and
talked with a handful of the Panther faithful for a few min-
utes. “What do you think coach,” we asked. Fazio answer-
ed honestly and realistically. “I think we can beat them,”
he quipped, “If we don’t give them a break early in the
game.”

As it turned out, that IF was a big one. The Panthers
not only gave the West Virginians one break, but a host of
“sophomore” mistakes by the sophomores, juniors and
seniors alike opened the gates for the Mountaineers.

The back-to-back, blocked punts in the first quarter
were perhaps the initial breaks which Fazio had hoped
could be avoided. But the punts were by far not only break-
downs. Four interceptions, two fumbles and crucial pen-
alties added to the Panther woes all afternoon.

After West Virgina had taken a 14-0 lead by virtue of
the two blocked punts, the Panthers started to move
through the air only to have the scoring opportunity thwart-
ed on the Mountaineer 19 yard line as a Jim Friedl pass
was intercepted in the end zone. Again in the second quar-
ter, Friedl had the offense moving into Mountaineer terri-
tory but the drive was foiled by another interception, this
time on the WVU 23.

With the score 21-0, West Virginia recovered a" fumble
on the Panther 17 and quickly converted the break into
a TD to’ widen -the margin to 28-0. The mistakes continued
in the second half as well. A third interception went for a
touchdown halfway through the third period. And again in
the third period, the Panther defense had apparently stop-
ped a WVU drive on a third down play, but the defense was
penalized for a personal foul, moving the ball to the Pan-
ther 33. Five plays later‘, West Virginia had another score.

We're not making excuses for Saturday’s loss. West
Virginia had the better football team on this particualr Sat-
urday afternoon. But Panther miscues made the job quite
a bit easier for the Mountaineers. With Syracuse coming
into the Stadium this weekend, the Panthers face another
tough opponent. Yet this reporter believes that the Pan-
thers can win, if they want it bad enough. And if they don’t
play give-away again this Saturday. A

t # * # #

One of the bright spots in the game for the Panthers
was the performance of tailback Dave Garnett on kick-off
returns. Garnett broke loose for returns of 69 and 73
yards in the second half. The junior speedster from Buffa-
lo, N. Y., broke the existing Mountaineer Stadium record
and the Panther record for returns. His total of 220 yards
broke the record set by Eric Crabtree in 1965. ~

The Panther defense, led by middle linebacker Ralph
Cindrich, made an impressive goal line stand in the second
quarter. With first and goal on the three yard line, West
Virginia’s powerful offense was stopped cold on four plays.
Cindrich again played an outstanding game and his inter-

ception early in the second half led to the first Panther 

score .

_SlJRROUNDED BY A host of dark-shirted Mountaineers, Tony Esposito is stopped for a short gain. Typical of the
frustrating afternoon for the Panther offense, the quick,’ aggressive West Virginia "defenders came up with the big
play when needed, forcing two furnhgl,e\s,; four interceptions and hlockiing two pudntjs. ' .-

Just minutes after his West
Virginia Mountaineers had
completed their “kil1in” of the
Saturday by a 49-18 margin, Jim
_Carlen unloaded one of the better
linderstatements upon the inhabi-
tants of WVU’s new press box.

He should have been, though, be-
cause sophomore fullback Ed Wil-
liams racked up more yardage in
the game than he had in his five-
game career as a Mountaineer.
The third-string back totaled 199
yards on only 11 carries. He had
140 yards on 31 rushing attempts
going into the game.

This made the Panther fans for-
get about the two guys (what were
their names, again?) who they
were worried about prior to the
contest.

The Mountaineers’ leading
rushers, Bob Gresham and Jim
Braxton, played only half of the
game because they “were bruised
up a bit,” and they gained only 70
yards, 50 of the yards produced
via the feet of Greham.

In fact, the best running combo
in the nation took a back seat to
another WVU rusher — quarter-
back Mike Sherwood.

The signal caller ran for 109
yards on seven carries, with most
of that coming on a 70-yard
jaunt in the second quarter. The
long run which went for naught be-
cause of a Panther goal-line stand
was such a beautiful thing to
watch that the usually objective
play-by-play release from the
West Virginia publicity staff call-
ed it “a smart, phenomenal" run,
following blockers at every
stride.”

Panther coach Carl DePasqua
agreed that the Mountaineer run-
ner was better-than—average,
knowing very well that WVU’s 435
yards rushing was the thing that
beat his squad.

“We didn’t think they’d do it
against us,” he said. “But they
have some great runners. Their
backs broke a lot of tackles. We
just didn’t hit them with enough
authority.”

DePasqua couldn’t be blamed
for expecting the Panthers to hold
WVU’s runners. His grid defense
had held the last three opponents
to 33 yards on the ground.

Though the rushing figures were
important, they weren’t the en-
tire story of the Panther disaster.

good day, gaining 84 yards in the losing cause. '.

The Mountaineers were ready
to block a punt after doing so
many times in practice during the
last two weeks. And they doubled
their pleasure by snuffing two of
Joe Spicko’s punts Within a three-
minute span. Both John Hale ef-
forts resulted in WVU scores.

“The blocking of the punts came
about by missed assignments,”
DePasqua said. “It was a‘ com-
bination of bad blocking and bad
execution.

“And along with that you have
to include bad coaching. We didn’t
do a good job of reviewing.”

Early in the game it looked like
the Mountaineers had forgotten
to review the “How to Play Foot-
ball” book — they weren’t going
into a huddle. Of course, it was an
intentional move on the part of
Carlen.

“We called the no-huddle series
to start with so the Pitt rushers
wouldn’t have much time to call
their own defensive signals, since
they use the pro-style,” Carlen
reasoned. .

DePasqua wasn’t too concern-

. ed about the no-huddle series,

however.

“At first, it bothered us a lit-
tle,” he admitted. “But not after
that.”

“After that” it didn’t really
matter because the Mountaineers
broke away from the Panthers af-
ter the blocked punts and ran wild.
WVU also recovered a Jungle Cat
fumble and grabbed four of Jim
Friedl’s passes.

Leon Jenkins returned one of
these interceptions 31 yards for a
Mountaineer touchdown in the
third quarter.

Friedl completed a couple of
TD aerials, though. The first one
came early in the second half after

" "(Cyan Ashland Oil Reach the INNER YOU? Deep down inside, where
“you live, there is a “something" that will help you recognize the

"right" career . . . you'll feel the first symptoms of success . . . a
hard to repress bubbling enthusiasm emerging from the inner you
-will take your talent and training on an exciting drive above and
beyond the ‘capabilities you recognize now.

_ ‘Often, that's how great things happen. Not by cool calculation"
but, by the._fortunate meld of ability, ambition and opportunity.

Can Ashland Oil turn on the inner you? Obviously you won't

 know unless you investigate.

' 9' ' And that's what we're asking you to do. Look us over..

Who are we? —- Ashland Oil & Refining"Company is a 44 year

performances with a fifth place
finish, followed by freshman Dave
Szabat (10th), Mark Vornhagen
(12th). and Bill Harvey (17th).
Bob Hagner, who missed the en-
tire ’68 campaign with an injury
finished 21st and appears to be
getting much stronger.

Leading the entire field was
Guelph University’s McAllister.
The young Canadian was a mem-
ber_ of his country’s Olympic team
and he beat Jerry Richey by al-
most a half of a minute. His fin-
ishing time was only 1.5 seconds
off the course record. Guelph Uni-
versity finished third in the meet,
while Lehigh finished second.

Coach Jim Banner commentgd

that “it was a very fast race.”
This is borne out by the fact the
meet’s three top runners were all
under last year's first place time.
Jerry Richey, unofficially ran 13
seconds under his 1968 time of
22:01. Jerry had little chance to
finish first as McAllister started
out fast and, although Richey stay-
ed with him for a while, ran away
with the race before it was half
over.

With this sixth victoryrof the
season Coach Banner was asked
whether hepreferred invitational
tournaments to dual and tri-squad

meets. “Invitationals are nicer,.

of course. The boys get medals
and you get a big trophy if you win,
but you still need the dual meets
to balance out the season.” Ban-
ner, who has been head coach of
the cross-country team since 1966,
is very pleased with his team’s
progress this season. He feels that
he has a “very fine” squad.

Undefeated seasons are -not new
for Coach Banner though. In 1964,
as assistant coach of the cross-
country team, the squad finished
the season undefeated. If his 1969
distancemen can beat Penn State
Nov. 8 they will finish their cam-
paign 7-0.

tant competitor all year long, did
not run Saturday because of a bad

A leg he’s been nursing for the last

few days. Mike Nolan did not
make the trip to Buffalo.

The Canisius victory does not ' '

go on the Panthers’ record but it
is still a satisfying oneifor Coach
Banner and his harriers. They

now go back to the practice field i .

to prepare for Penn State.

“Penn State beat West Virginia,
but we did too. I think we had one
of our p_oorer days against West
Virgina,” the coach stated. He
also indicated that, cold weather
not ‘ withstanding, the practices
will go pretty much the same in
preparation for the N ittany Lions.

Soccer coach Leo Bemis’ defense locked the doors on the

West Virginia Mountaineers Saturday, but just a single opening

cost the booters the game, 1-0. Tomorrow, in an attempt to col-

rugged play of the two squads, he
refused to recklessly dole out
praise to either of the partici-
pants.

“Lots of fellows’ played well,

effort; everyone played hard,”
said Bemis.

We’re struggling to get the finish

6, with Bob Laughrey and Bob Le-
pore aiding the score by snagging
two TD passes each. Pat Carey
was outstanding on defense.

The Phi Eps put on a less spec-
tacular show, edging past Phi

Dave Valinsky accounted for
the first Phi Ep score by netting
a TD pass while George Orlowitz
added the winning six points with
another touchdown reception".

Both teams have 2-0 records.

will pit themselves against Theta
Chi. ’

Theta Chi has’ maintained a 3-0
record. They trounced Alpha Ep-
silon Pi, 34-0, in theirfirst game
in which Ron Fiorvanti and Bob
Wingard each pulled in two of
Warren Nystron’s passes. Ny-
strom, himself, then carried the
ball for a score. Greg Ross help-
ed on defense with two intercep-
tions. _ _

Their second win was a 26-14
victory over Delta Sigma Chi in
which Dave Hauch received two
touchdown passes from Nystrom.
Fiorvanti also caught a Nystrom
pass for another six points.

Jack Smelkl carried the
skin for another TD. Conversions
netted two more points.

Claypool scoring from the one yard
line and Cliff Brown adding an-
other six points. Paul Henderson
