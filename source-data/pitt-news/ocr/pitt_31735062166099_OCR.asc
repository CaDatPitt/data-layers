tion given Friday, Oct. 26, in
the Commons Room, Eisen-
hower received an over-
whelming majority of 700
votes. Stevenson received 332.

That gives Eisenhower an edge
of 368 votes. Four years ago Ike

Ike and Stevenson first ran

Helps All—All At Once

Plans Set For Pitt Chest

By JOYCE KOPLOS

The Pitt Chest has announced its annual drive willistart

next week. Each year students are given a chance “To help

_ them all, all at once.”
Pitt Chest has planned its most ambitious program in

its history. “We are looking forward to full student coopera-

tion,". said Sam Reich, General Chairman of the Pitt Chest.

The program consists of three
forms of solicitation. On Wed-
nesday, Nov. 7, during fourth
hour, speakers urging support
of the drive will talk in every
class. These voluntary speakers

’i“‘_have been drawn from variops

h o n o r organizations, speech
classes, Men’s Debate Associa-
tion, and Women's Speech Asso-
ciation.

Class oﬂlcers will also solicit in
the follow-up campaign to put the
Pitt Chest over the top. Special
projects such as dances, jazz con-
certs, variety shows, and auctions
will be scheduled this week.

Sam Reich thanked the Wom-
en’: Self Government Associa-
tion, Men's Council, and Student
Congress for the excellent eo-
operation they have given. He
also commented, “Last year
with better than 5,000 full-time
students. we collected less than
$2,800. This was a per eapita
contribution of 56 cents for
toll-time student. In contrast to

and state candidates for govern-
ment offices, and an Information
Day which featured literature and
question booths to inform stu-
dents and faculty of the leading
issues and party platforms.

Mild Heart Attack
Hits Dr. Crawford
At Buffalo Meeting

Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, Dean

of the Faculties and Secretary of
the University, suffered a mild
heart attack over the weekend.

The attack, described by mem-
bgrs of the dean's staff as a “mild
coronary,” occurred either Friday
or Saturday in Buffalo, New York.

Dr. Crawford had gone to
Buffalo to attend a meeting of
the Middle States Association
Evaluation Team, an organiza-
tion concerned with the status
of colleges and universities in
that section of the United
States. .

Although he is chairman of the
group, the attack prevented Dean
Crawford from attending the
meeting. He is, however, now
resting comfortably in the Buffalo
General Hospital.

As Dean of the Faculties, a
newly created post at the Uni-
versity, Dr. Crawford is a key
man in the preparation and co-
ordination of policy matters which
the Chancellor brings before the
board of trustees and the‘ staff
council. His position also makes
him chief liaison-officer with the
p,.,p.,ﬁon “A ¢heh.',i,c_ Sc“-oh "faculty on problems affecting the

ham collected $2.00 per capita.
This year our goal is $1.50 per
student to help stibport 16 ma-
jor charities.”

To add to the knowledge of the
planning committee, they arranged
a meeting with a United Fund
worker who told them that
Pitt had deﬁnite obligations to
the community. He urged the
committee to impress on Pitt stu-
dents the fact that they should
give generously now to prepare
themselves for their future roles
as responsible citizens.

The agencies to receive the
funds 0.‘ the drive were decided
on by members of the Pitt Chest
Committee, faculty members, and
student government representa-
tives. They also reviewed the pro-
-gram planned.for next week.

available for single educational
effort in a comparable period in
America."

Dr. A. C. Van Duscn, Assistant
Chance1lor’—Planning and .De-
velopmcnt, stated, “Since the fact
that this money from an anony-
mous donor comes when it is so
important to see the completion of
the goal, I felt that it will give a
great impetus to corporations,
foundations, and individuals to
respond to this unique program
in health education.” '

Corporate gifts from business
in Pittsburgh and elsewhere in
the nation have accounted for ap-
proximately 70 per cent of the
$13,300,000 which has been raised
toward the total construction cost
of $15,000,000 for the new struc-
ture. The remaining amount has
been contributed by individuals
and foundations.

Dr. Litchﬁeld noted that this
latest half-million dollar gift
brings the health schools building
fund to within $1,700,000 of its
goal. He expressed conﬁdence that

‘The regulation reads.

there shall be no sale or
use of beer, wine, or liquor

of any kind at meetings or social
functions held under the aus-
pices of University activities and

“It was charged that, at a foot-
ball game Saturday, Oct. 29, 1956,

by the possession and use of alco-
holic beverages at the game.
These persons,‘ while under the
influence of alcohol, engaged in

charged to be abusive and annoy-
ing. This language and conduct
continued until members of the
fraternity prevailed upon the men
involved to stop. i

Latest Judicial Group Decision
Finds Fraternity Memlier Guilty

Of Scliool Liquor Law Offense

Judicial Commission of Interfraternlty Council handed
down the second decision of its history Friday. Oct. 19. The
decision was passed on a complaint ﬁled against Sigma Alpha

The decision was as follows: “Violation of University

regulations concerning conduct at University athletic events.
‘The 9

nity was not seated as a group.
He testified that although he and
other members of the fraternity
were seated in the same general
area, the fraternity was not seated

“(The fraternity member in-
volved) presented himself to the
Commission voluntarily. He testi-
fied that he was entirely guilty
of the charge. He also emphasized
that he was not seated in a frat-
ernity group and that the per-
sons seated with him were not
members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

“The Commission, after hear-
ing the testimony, has decided
that the evidence does not in‘-
dicate that the fraternity was
seated as a block. The Commis-
sion feels, however, that since
members of Sigma Alpha Ep-

knowledge of the violation, that

Poetry Readers Plan
Fall Term Program

By DONNA CONSIDINE

A program whose aim is to enrich the intellectual extra
curricular life of the campus will be launched tomorrow.

Pitt’s Poetry Reading Group will have its ﬁrst fall meet-
ing Thursday at 3:30 p.m. in the Aldred Room, sixth floor
library, with Lawrence Lee, professor of English, discussing
his own book, “Work in Progress: A Reading of Uncollected

Poems.”

The Poetry Group was created
last spring by a handful of faculty
members “in order to make avail-
able to the student body of every
branch of the University a living

' contact with the world’s great lit-

erature,” according to Jack Kol-
bert, assistant professor in modern
languages and one of the organ-
izers of the group.

Program Successful

He added that the program last
semester was one of the most suc-
cessful of its type at Pitt, and
that many persons asked that the
programs be continued. “We in-
terpret ‘poetry’ in the broadest
sense of the word to mean all _.,of
man’s creative literary activity.”

The series, sponsored by the
Humanities Society of the Uni-
versity, can beneﬁt those stu-
dents who don’t have time or an
opportunity to take varied Eng-
lish courses, as well as supple-
menting class work for litera-
ture students.

A committee of faculty mem-
bers has been appointed to form-
ulate the policy and program for
the coming months. Members are:
Ruth Haun, assistant professor of
speech; W. George Crouch, chair-
man of the English Department;
Michael McHale, assistant profes-
sor of speech and director of Pitt
Players; Putnam Jones, Dean of
Graduate Faculties; Lorena Gar-
loch, University librarian; William
C. Panetta, assistant professor of
Classics; George B.‘ Fowler, pro-
fessor of history; and Kolbert.

Acquaint Students

This committee wishes to pre-
sent a program which will not be
duplicated in the classroom. It
stresses the desire, not only to ac-
quaint the students with the mas-
ter works of English literature, but
also those of foieign literature
through the presentation of bi-
lingual readings.

Although past programs and
those planned for this semester
have featured persons connected
with the University, the society
plans to include guests of inter-

national renown in its presenta-

tions for next semester.

After Mr. Lee opens the sea-
son tomorrow, a program will

. be held Wednesday, Nov. 7, at

3:30 p.m. with Walter Hovey,
head of the Fine Arts Depart-
ment, who will discuss “Poetry
and Art,” in the Fine Arts Gal-
lery, seventh ﬂoor. This will be
the only time that the program
will not be given at the regular
Thursday hour.

Dr. Edwin Peterson, on leave of
absence from the English Depart-
ment, will be the speaker Nov. 15.
His subject concerns the love let-
ters of Thomas Carlysle.

An Italian-English reading of
parts of “The Divine Comedy” will
be given by Dr. Joseph Greco, as-
sistant professor of mode-rn lan-
guages, Nov. 29. ‘

The subjects of the following

programs will be announced at a y

Pitt student nurses will be
attending a state convention
this weekend at the Bellevue-
Stratford Hotel in Philadel-
phia. The Student Nurses As-
sociation of Pennsylvania

(SNAP), the official professional
organization for student nurses in
Pennsylvania and one of the 47
constituents ofvthe National Stu-
dent Nurses Association (NSNA),
is holding their annual conven-
tion. Delegates from every nurs-
ing school in the state will be at.-
tending.

Each year the association
conducts a convention in which
the SNAP programs, activities
and policies are considered and
decided upon by the members.
The new officers are also elected
at this time.

These conventions are open to
all’ students in Pennsylvania;
however, voting upon issues and
election of officers is done only
by official delegates. These dele-
gates represent member schools
of nursing and the number per-
mitted per school is based upon
the percentage of students from
that school who are SNAP mem-
bers.

The Pitt school of nursing has
a 100% membership which al-

lows them to send three dele-

Voice In The Dark I

Several students from the University had the honor of
being among Voices of America tape recorded for broadcast
behind the Iron Curtain to Czechoslovakia this past week-
end. s .

The program was planned and presented by the Czecho-
slovak Nationality Room Committee in celebration of the
independence of the Czechoslovak republic of 1918. Master
of ceremonies professor Josef Macek spoke in the Czecho-
slovak language about the freedom-loving people in that
country. Recitations of work by a Czechoslovak poet were
read by another member of the committee. .

Two women students from Heinz Chapel choir sang a
The Americans and Czechoslovak national anthems
were sungby the more—than the-one-hundred people present.

Meetings like this Czechoslovakprogram are common
and numerous amongpthe Nationality Room committees.
Each committee formed originally 1_n order to keep alive, at
the University and community, the spirit and traditions of
particular European and Asiatic nations represented in the
cit . -
yDuring various respective national holidays, the Rooms
are decorated according to thecustom of each. For March
7, birthday of Czechoslovak president Thomas Masaryk, coun-
try ﬂowers were placed in the Room, and~a plaque depict-
ing President Masaryk was placed in a corner supboard of
the room. _ .

During Christmas, a tree and nativity scene were placed
in each of the rooms. Cardboard ﬁgures in the Czecho-
slovak nativity scene were painted costumes typical of the
early native Czechoslovak clothing. '

One or two women students have_the opportunity to
work with*each of these‘ Rooms’ committees as a result of
belonging to Quo Vadis hostess’ society. Initiation into
Quo Vadis society occurs after students have attended a
week of summer classes, and have taken a test proving

. ability to interpret the Rooms to visitors.

Approximately’ 60,000 people visit the University an-
nually to see the Nationality Rooms. Hostesses. let people
know of the heritage and tradition of the nation behind
each room. And while they interpret traditions to others,
these students meet the many people who enrich our cul-
ture with their foreign backgrounds. . .

Opportunities open to these qualiﬁed hostesses then vary
from guiding high school students through the Rooms to
speaking over the “Voice of America.”

Those students present at the Czechoslovak program
last‘ week-end certainly had a precious experience. BC

A Visit With The Veep  .

Nixon At Cornell

By Rosemary Rey

Vice President Richard M. Nixon and his wife
Pat stepped out of the door of a plane at Ithaca '
airport in New York. A loud cheer and various-
shaped “Pat and Dick” signs went up from the
group of Young Republicans that had gathered at
the airport to meet the couple. Nixon had come to

so to spend-the day on the Cor-  *
nell University campus. The pur-
pose of his trip was to attend a
press conference wtih 42 college
editors later that evening over
a nationally televised program?
But there were other things
planned for the Veep before -‘the
big show.

He hurried past the partisan
crowd after a short speech. A 
radio news reporter stopped Mrs. Nixon and asked
for an interview, apparently concerning the politi-
cal campaign. She refused, and as was explained to
the college editors later by a reporter traveling with
Nixon, “Pat will stop and talk about anything, .
anytime,” he said, “except politics.”

Press Conference Held

The Veep entered a room where reporters from
the New York Times, wire service, and Chicago"
Tribune ﬁred questions at him for the benefit of the
42 student editors who had come as far away as
Nixon’s hometown in California. The pressmen——
about 10 of them—-were traveling with Nixon on
his plane as he campaigned from city to city. They
spoke highly of the ‘Vice President regarding his
willingness to aid the reporters in getting stories.

 

Above Average Students

“He’s gone so far as to hold press conferences in
the air,” one of them said later.

The press conference of most importance, how-
ever, was theione held later that night at Bailey
Hall on the Cornell Campus before a capacity crowd
of Cornell students and thousands of viewers across
the nation. The visiting editors threw their own, un-
rehearsed‘ questions at the candidate for vice pres-
ident of the United States.

Investigations Needed?

Questioned one student, “Do you think the kind
of investigations conducted by Senator Joseph R.
McCarthy, Wisconsin Republican, are needed to-
day?” Nixon replied an emphatic no. “I think the
Eisenhower administration security policies should
be given credit for taking this issue out of the po-
litical arena,” he said.

Another editor questioned. ‘‘There ,have bee
statements made that your method of campaigning I
has changed from that of four years ago. Is that so?”
This time Nixon’s answer was in the afﬁrmative.

“Of course our method has changed,” he said.
“Four years ago, the Democrats were in oﬁice. Our
campaignwas more of a destructive one. For the
past four years the Republicans havebeen in office.
Our campaign now is a constructive one." And so
the questions went, ranging from the hydrogen
bomb to the Suez crisis to private housing. Some
students went away from the conference feeling
stronger for Nixon then when they had come. Oth-
ers went away feeling stronger against him. Most
of the editors, however, left with, a feeling that
they had gained something valuable from the ex)»-
perience. One thing that is sure. They had certainly
seen the inside workings of a hot political campaign.

This Thing Jazz

By Phil Mosliol

Jazz is a word that is deﬁned
by the dictionary as: A type of
music that is characterized by
Melodious themes, feverish or
subtly syncopated dance rhy-
thms, and varied orchestral col-

oring . . . This is a very lean "

deﬁnition of jazz. However, it is
partially correct. The deﬁnition
that I consider to be applicable
is: A different type of music
that is characterized by, a de-
ﬁnite harmony, improvisation,
and subtle meanings of . notes
that gives to the audience the
thoughts and ideas of the per-
forming artists. Here again, I
incorporate the word “soul.” The
word “soul” connates that un-
explicable ability of a musician
to play meaningful phrases of
his own.

The group that is able to in-
corporate individual artistry in-
to a combo and still play the
most complicated passages at an
unbelieveable pace should be
praised by all. The music that I

heard was not played by neo-A
phytes in the music world. But

any longer, have dropped out,qf
school.

In 1951, the Ford Foundation
launched its “Early Admissions
Program,” to provide ‘scholar-
ships for students having com-
pleted at least tenth grade, and
displaying the scholastic ability
to handle college work. At ﬁrst,
many educators were a bit dubi-
ous as to how these 15 and 16

year,-olds would ﬁt into, and
adapt to college life.
However, their fears were

eventually dispelled, as these
youngsters proved themselves
every bit as capable as their
elders, and supposedly more ma-
ture college chums;

Dr. Clarence H. Faust, presi-
dent of “Ford’s Fund for the Ad-
vancement of Education” says,
“The younger students not only
performed better than the aver-
age of their classmates, but gen-
erally outperformed a group who
were matched with them in abil-
ity but who had had four years
of high school work. Likewise,
the social adjustment of the

by accomplished artists that hail
from a University in Pittsburgh.
The group entered into a ren-
dition of “Willow Weep for Me”
and progressed into an elevated
state of improvisation that is not
typical of all musicians. I lis-
tened to harmony that was
seemingly impossible ~ to accom-
plish, improvisation that would
make _many a professional ask,
How? This was and is the de-
ﬁnition of the Jazz idiom.
During the session, one indivi-
dual remarked, “I been to Bird-
land, I been on the Coast (West)
and I been everywhere there is
Jazz, man, I never heard any-
one that can play like these
fellas.” It is in this quotation
that the meaning of Jazz is
found. The very essence of the
idiom is the most powerful and
least understood of the voca-
bulary of the world today. The
person that doesn’t like Jazz,
the ardent fan and the musician
should listen to this group. The
music of the Chuck Leroy quar-
tet is the most “soulful” music
ever heard.

younger students was found to
be as ‘satisfactory as that of col-

lege “students who had come

through the regular high school
preparation.” - -
Individual Matter

So it seems as though imma-
turity, and inability to deal with

the problems encountered in CO1-,9

lege life, as opposed to thos,‘

found in high school, is more 

matter of the individual himselffg

rather than of age.  

The results of the Ford experi-
ment have shown that students
of above average ability can,
with good results, be allowed to
a c c e l e r a t e their. education,

. whereas before this type of pro-

gram had been tried on a large
scale, it was only a few of the
more brilliant students that were
given this opportunity.

the students who participated .1!)

This combo is composed of

few of the numbers that I heard ,4”

were, “My ‘ Funny Valentine?’

Chest Donates To School Fund

(‘Editor’s Note: This is the
first in a series of articles on the
beneﬁciaries of the Pitt Chest.
These articles will show where
your donation goes.) '

By MURRAY CHASS

Dr. Ralph Bunche, Under
Secretary of the Department
of Trusteeship of the United
Nations and winner of the
Nobel Peace Prize, has said,
“In their struggle upward,

students everywhere need a help-
ing hand. Their road is hard, their
needs are critical. But . . . they
can count on friends. One of these

. , friends is World University Serv-

‘ice. This organization .

. . is en-
gaged in a world-wide mutual aid
program directed at helping stu-
dents to help themselves, giving
a helping hand to the leaders of
tomorrow.”

This, in short, describes the job
that World University Service,
one of the beneﬁciaries of the
Pitt Chest, performs. This year
the Chest has decided to present
35 per cent of its funds to WUS.
Why have the leaders of the Chest
chosen such a large amount to
give to one organization?

Perhaps because we at Pitt are

/ fortunate in that we‘ live in a

prosperous country, we do not
realize the overwhelming great-

vness of the needs of students in

foreign lands. The World Uni-
versity Service has.

Problems Vital

The problems of foreign stu-
dents are elementary, but never-
theless vital. They need decent
living quarters, good health facili-
ti e s, satisfactory educational
equipment, and of course ﬁnancial
aid. Here are a few diversiﬁed
examples of these necessities:

Forty per cent of Pakistan’s
students will not ﬁnish college
because they lack ﬁnancial
-help; two out of. three student
refugees in Germany live on less
than $1 a day; 20,000 Japanese
college students are tuberculous,
and 3,000 to 5,000 desperately
need hospitalization which costs
as much as_the average Jap-
anese family earns in a whole
year; and 3,000 Calcutta Univer-
sity students have no place to
live while 23,000 reside in
homes where they are allotted a
space equal to the size of a twin
bed.

One very noticeable problem
has arisen since the close of the
war in Korea. There are 42 insti-
tutions of higher learning in
Korea, with a total enrollment of
34,000 students. To accommodate
this number, only between 25 and
30 hostels and dormitories exist.
Two years ago a war-damaged
building in Seoul was bought and
repaired at a cost of $21,500. This
money came from funds raised by
WUS in the United States. Now,
sixty Korean students from var-
ious Seoul Universities occupy
this building. Surely numerous
other dormitories must ' be con-
structed to meet the needs of the
other students.

Hard At War

WUS has been hard at work the
past few years raising funds
which will enable students to

 overcome all of these problems.

In recent years WUS has built
a hostel in Calcutta which accom-
modates 96 students and another
in Karachi, Pakistan, which
houses 100 students.

In 12 years some 12,000 stu-
dents have been treatedat the in-
ternational health center in Com-
bloux, France, which is owned

and operated by WUS‘. They have

Negro Students is included in

The Scholarship Service aids
Negro students both in gaining
admission to colleges and then
receiving ﬁnancial help to permit
them to remain there. The funds
that NSSNS receives from drives
such as the Chest are distributed
to deserving Negro students as
initial aid and also supplements to
other college scholarships. This
supplementary -aid program is
carried on because many Negro

ships from the school of their

dollars more to enable them to

“Power versus Power” will

Michigan, the Gophers picked up
only 56 yards via the ‘air lanes to
verify Coach Murray Warmath’s
emphasis on power plays.

Looking over scouting reports,
-Coach Vic Fusia commented,
“This Minnesota team will out-
weigh us ﬁve to ten pounds per
man. With this team looking. for
a Rose Bowl bid, they will be
especially hard to stop.

“The. backﬁeld is made up of
big, hard—running backs with two
excellent quarterbacks in Bob
Cox and Dick Larson to guide
them. They aren’t a team that
will explode for long runs but
will grind out yardage and main-
tain possession of the ball.”

in the hands of the injured. Four
regulars have been sitting out the
ﬁrst three days of practice nursing

and recognizes the fact’ that
lacking in the, Panther Cub attack$

more important things are

than the ability to make conver-

One weak spot is the offensive

BemisRevampsLineup
For Wolfpaclc Game

, BYMURRAY A. CHASS

A wholly revised Panther soccer team may take the ﬁeld
against North Carolina State, Friday, as Coach Leo Bemis
tries to shake a slump that has now lasted through three
games. Just what the starting eleven will be, however, is
not even clear in Bemis’ mind.

“The next two or three days will mean a lot,” says Bemis. »

“We’re going to have a couple of¢

rough scrimmages, and these will
show‘who is going to be in there
on Friday,” adds Bemis.

As of now, the Panther mentor
is contemplating ‘ 1
a number of
c h a n g e s, in-
cluding a switch
in his defensive
alignment. Un-
til n o w t h e
Panther defense
has featured-
three fullbacks
and two half-
backs. For the
tussle at Ken-
nard Field with
the Wolfpack, though, Bemis may
reverse this procedure and usetwo
fullbacks and three halfs.

As for individual positions, any-
thing goes. Bob Sadowski, a soph-
omore who has been out for a
long stretch with an injured foot,
will get a chance at the fullback
spot vacated by injured Bill Eis-
inger. Eisinger is sidelined with a
sore left knee.

Another sophomore who may
break into the first eleven is
Frank Reginella. Bemis has been
pleased with 'Reginella’s work at
center forward and hopes that
his insertion into the lineup will
put some much-needed spark
into the weak Panther attack.

Jack Hester, who has been out-
standing at halfback, may be mov-
ed into an inside line position. If
this is done, Dennie Neuman would
start at the halfback spot. Finally

‘Al Solomon, originally a lineman

and now a ‘fullback, may further
be employed as a halfback if the
new system is used.

No matter who is on the ﬁeld_

for the Blue and Gold, though,
they will be up against a well-
balanced team from Raleigh. The
Wolfpack’s defense is intact from
last year and should prove _the
biggest obstacle for the Panthers.

As it does in most other

has made a major contribution
to North Carolina State’s squad.
The Red and White’s leading
defensive threat, Ray Baxter,
hails from Harmarville, Pa. _
The Southerners will be out
to make it two in a row over the
locals. In 1955 they were victori-
ous, 2-1. The Wolfpack also came
out on top in departed players as
they had two men thrown out of
the contest for repeated rough-

at least come _out ahead in the.

? Appears Certain

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Sports Editor

  

For ﬁve years now there has been talk about football:
powers such as Pitt, Syracuse, Army, and Notre Dame form-
ing a football conference and thus removing their indepen-
dent status by such action. Most of the past reports have
been mere hearsay. Last week the conference rumors again
popped up. This time, however, it looks like it will be the

genuine thing.
Pitt is supposedly taking an “open mind” stand on the proposed
 Trans-Continental Conference that would include Pitt, Army, Navy,
Air Force, Notre Dame,.Oklahoma, Southern California, and UCLA.
The “reliable source” which uttered this proposal is deﬁnitely a “re-
liable source.” ’
When such a conference does materialize, it will have no

‘equal. Not even the Big Ten or the Southwest Conference could

.match it for rivalry, drawing power, prestige, and intersectional

ﬂavor. When this league is formed it will have all of these ex-

cept West Coast ﬂavor because it will be no more than a six
team setup.

"Southern California and UCLA will not bolt the Paciﬁc Coast
Conference in favor of this new organization which will likely be
named the Midwest Conference or the Mid-American Conference.
Should USC and UCLA ,jump the PCC it‘ would virtually mean

_ Aruination of the PCC. It would probably relegate Coast football to Ivy
‘—../‘'League caliber because these two schools are the grid powers and
the ‘drawing powers on the West Coast. The PCC will do all they
can to prevent this from happening and should accomplish the mis-
sion without too much difficulty‘. ,.

At this stage the five teams that seem to favor the Conference
are Pitt, Army, Air Force, Oklahoma, and Notre Dame. Navy is the
one school that is slowing progress to a minimum. The reason is un-
known. When Oklahoma joins, they will terminate their membership
in the Big Seven. —It should be a great day for the other -member
schools when the Sooners do.’ They will probably be _more than
happy to settle for the Big Six.

- Perhaps it’s surprising that Eastern powers Penn State and
Syracuse haven’t been mentioned. Syracuse has shown little
interest and State doesn’t have the Stadium with a large enough
seating capacity. The other schools would be able to hold up-
wards of (55,000 fans for games with Army undoubtedly playing
some of their home games in Yankee Stadium where 80,000 is
capacity. The Air Force plans a huge stadium which would be
able to accommodate the large crowds, too.

‘With six teams the setup would be ideal. Each team would
‘have ﬁve conference games and ﬁve other contests that could be
played with the opponents of their own choosing. The present rival-
ries would not have to be discontinued even though it would make
independents hustle in order to arrange schedule conﬁictions.

Now comes the possibility of a bowl aﬁiliation. Would the teams
approve_of post-season classics or outlaw them? Early indications
are they will approve a pact with the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Tex.,
':for the winner to play the champ of the Southwest Conference. It
would be similar to the current Big Ten-Paciﬁc Coast pact.

Of "course it would take anywhere from ﬁve to eight years to
realize the setup because of prior schedule commitments. Time will
remedy this, however.

Problem

, By AL PELAEZ
The rich farms and pasturelands ‘of Minnesota have ap-
parently dulled the adventurous spirit of‘ its predominately
Nordic people. In the past Norsemen like Lief Ericson were

continually travelling the tre

acherous seas in open boats

trying to ﬁnd new and challenging:
lands. Nowadays their anglized
counterparts, rather than looking
for new ﬁelds to conquer, are pre-
paring to play football against the

to whom they have never lostin
eight previous meetings.

" Apparently the odds — makers
have sensed the habitual ways of
the mid-westerners and have pre-
dicted that the Gophers will fol-
low the same pattern they’ve used

against the Panthers since 1933.
The fact that Minnesota is rated
a favorite over Pitt has caused a
great deal of consternation in the
twisted turban sections of the na-
tion. ,

All early reports ﬁgured the
Gophers—who had" a 3-6 record
last year—to be one of the soft
touches on the Panther’s arduous
schedule. Instead, they've turn-
ed out to be the toughest foe
met to date. ~

The main reason for this unex-
pected resurgence is quarterback
Bobby Cox, a transfer from Wash-
ington. Cox, who started the sea-
son as a substitute, won a start-
ing position in the Gopher’s ﬁrst
game against———ironically enough——-
Washington. The junior sensation
came off the bench to pitch his
team to a 34-14 victory. He has
also been the main factor in Min-
nesota’s_ wins over Purdue, Illi-

Incidentally, Fisk plays Lane
in “The Game of the -Weak.”
This struggle between two of
the biggest powers of the pla-
teaus is billed as a night affair
—it will probably turn into a
circus before it’s completed,
especially since Lane's quarter-
-back Lover Leaveum has done
just that.

Joining the elite this week is
tackle Herman Canil of the foot-
ball team. Herman thinks that
Pitt will beat the Golden Go-
phers. Let’s hope he’s right. If
Canil doesn’t show any more_

aerial attack are a trio of danger-
ous and speedy runners. Starting
fullback Rich Borstad has been
averaging nearly ﬁve yards per
carry this season. ‘ '
The halfback slots will be held
down by ‘(en Bombardier and
Bob Schultz, who, like Borstad,
are juniors. Both Bombardier
and Schultz are averaging over
ﬁve yards each time they handle
the ball. Schultz, in addition to
being the top ground gainer on
the team is the second leading
pass receiver.

The strength of the backﬁeld is
matched in the line-—-a big, pow-
erful array capable of holding
their own. against the vaunted
Panther forward wall. This rugged
line could, however, be the “achil-
les heel” of -the Gophers. A lack
of capable reserves could result in
irreparable damage if any of the
regulars are injured.

Sport shirts that light up in ‘

that ﬂash messages, like “Hey,
baby, you're a honey,” or
“Pass the ashtray, please.”
Useful for parties, faculty teas
and cotillion balls. But they
tend to commercialize the
graceful art of conversation.
. Sport shirts with road maps
on them: Too dangerous. Say
you're driving from campus
‘ to the big city. You don't know
whether to turn left or right
at the turnpike, so you look
down at your shirt to check.
Crash! ‘ _

» Edible sport shirts: Too mis-
leading. You're sitting under a
shady tree with your favorite
co-ed. She rests her head gently

on your chest. You think she's
fond of you. Suddenly you hear
“munch, munc ,” and there
goes your delicious shirt! It

Architects of the new En-
gineering Building were sub-
ject to a close scrutiny of their
work ‘this past week. The
project: initiation into Pi Tau
Sigma, national mechanical

engineering fraternity.
The fraternity, which boasts of
having the most unusual pledge
program on campus, puts its
tappeesthrough a rigorous test of
their engineering resourcefulness.
“Practical” t e s t s included
counting the steps and doors in
the Engineering Building, fol-
lowed by a precise measurement
(to one sixteenth inch) of the
dimensions of the hallways.‘

Each pledge drew up, according to
“engineering plans” a scrool com-
taining the fraternity crest drawn
to scale. Besides this was a wood-
working project involving the
precision tooling of an open-head-
ed wrench out of wood. .
Pledges could be identiﬁed
last week carrying these “tools”
suspended around their necks.
_Also they were at all times
white work gloves and an en-
gineer’s cap and whistle, the
latter to be used in saluting all
fraters. -

Also among the initiation re-.
quisites were the demonstration,
of both drawing and manual skills. ,
