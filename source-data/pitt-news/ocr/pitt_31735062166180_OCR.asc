A number of children from the Pittsburgh area will
again be the happy recipients of toys this‘Christmas. The ~
occasion will be the third annual toy drive sponsored by
the Army Cadet Association at Pitt. The drive-originated

Kby a ROTC cadet at the University——was organized with
-the purpose of bringing some amount of Christmas tradi-
’ tion to orphans and underprivileged children. “

,_ The gifts are to be new toys valued at between 50 cents
and oneidollar, or used toys in good condition, brought from
a dusty play box or from a hiding, place in the attic.

, Toys will be collected in Army ROTC classes on Wed-
nesday, Dec. 12. Taking in all religious groups, distribution
of the gifts will be made, to the University religious organi-
zations-—Newman _Club, Hillel, and YMCA. In turn, mem-
bers of these organizations will take the Christmas gifts
to the orphans and underprivileged children of the area.

The drive, pointed to with pride by those associated
with it, indicates a facet of the University man’s personali-
ty often not seen by people outside the circle of school ac-
tivities. Many of the “outsiders” tend to think of collegians
as concerned only with exams, frat parties, sorority teas,

 pepﬁrallies, athletic teams, and the like.

Here is seen another side of the university man. Shar-
have not, he contributes-‘
_to the true spirit of Christmas———giving. For a moment, he
is seen displaying the warm heart beneath the tattersall
vest and the rep stripe tie, not always credited him by his

False Hopes Raised .. . . ~ . T T . .  
By Ed Bachmann»

Have you ever noticed an advertisement in, vari-
ous places like trolleys, buses, billboards, e'tc., de-
picting an elderly European couple sitting listen-
ing to a beat-up 1930-type radio? ‘With this pic-
ture was some statement, the gist of which was to

"‘give them hope; support Radio Free Europe.”
Americans, being the generous people which

they are, have seen this and simi-

‘lar ads throughout the years and

‘have dug deep into their pockets
not only to set up the'Radio Free
Europe system, but to expand it
greatly so as to include a large
potential listening audience in
Iron Curtain countries.

Those ads had A said, “Give

them hope.”‘Ho"wiwell has RFE F
i‘ done its job? . «  .
The,answer to this question has been debated
_greatly ever since RFE’s initiation. Some of the
idea’s criticism has been deserved; much of it un-
justiﬁed. But it wasn’t until the outbreak of the
Hungarian Rebellion this October that RFE critics
have made much sense. This radio system has now
been said to have contributed to the start of the A
Rebellion. Even one person has gone on record as
suggesting that the RFE slogan be changed to read,

“Give them FALSE hope.”

Denied Accusation

That statement may say moreithan meets the

eye.

I Radio Free'Europe executives have, of course,
denied the accusation. They claim that their pri-
mary purpose was to distribute, by way of an
underground system, radios to as many Iron Cur-
tain families as possible. And once radios are in

  

  

 

the hands of those people, the people will thirst for

truth.

 

Moscow feels.

But RFE is bucking one of ‘the ‘most _vicious
propaganda machines the world has ever known.
The Soviet rulers, realizing that the only way to “
keep their people in check, and satisﬁed with their _
way of life, is to force terrible untruths upon them.
False pictures are painted of the capitalistic world L
in a determined attempt to keep the truth from the
people the Russians control. The main element of ~
modern—day communism is to eliminate truth. If
their people never get a chanceito learn how badi
off they are, there never will be any discontent,

Step Up Program
So RFE has had to step up their program, in
an attempt to meet the Soviet lies.
stepping up, RFE has gone a little overboard. While ~
not exactly saying openly that Americans are go-
ing to help them in the near future, they have .
hinted this, and the Iron Curtain people are many
, times looking toward the West as its champion, long ~
before any such dream can become a reality.
And now we have a battered, blood-stained
Hungary, who, during the past month and a half,
has countlessly asked America: “Where are you?”
“When are you going to help us?” “Why are you
letting us down?” And America is forced to stand
by helplessly, along with the rest of the"free-‘

November 19, 1905. However,
the background of this musician
started in 1927, the years when
jazz was hot and loud. .

We might look back at one of
Dorsey’s jobs probably in. one of
the many smoke filled dungeons

he plays. the ad lib music that
was born in him.
Jazz Era of '27

The Jazz era of 1927 is that

T period in which the famous art-

ists of today were breeding in
small combos, such as Gene
Krupa who was currently with
Buddy Rogers’ small jazz band.

The years between 1927 and
1930 “jazzed by” and in the
passing Dorsey climbed a little
higher on the familiar “road of

- hard Knocks” and was a success-

ful free lance radio and record-
ing artist with his brother,
Jimmy. This was the time that
he was noticed for his recordings
of fast ballads.

In 1935 The Dorsey brothers
broke apart and Tommy formed

and was paid far below
cost. “The roof fell in when stu-
dents and workers in Poznan

were shot down merely for the
asking.”

The situation in Hungary was »
the same according to Gunther.
“The rebellion is not suppressed
because what happened there is
the beginning of the weakening
of the Soviet structure,” he de-
clared. Even some Riissian sol-
diers stationed in Hungary join-
ed the freedom fighters.

Russia was so severe in meet-
ing the rebellion because its suc-
cess would have triggered simi-
lar ractions throughout the East-
ern satellites and Russia would
have been pushed back to her

own borders. The promotion of

state communism was endanger-
ed.

trumpet section was capably

and Ziggy Elman. The clarinets
were Johnny Minfce and Buddy
DeFranco. Louis Bellson and
Dave Tough were the drummers
while Joe Bushkin had the piano
and Bud Freeman on the tenor
saxophone.

Present day singers were also
well represented during the life
of the band. Some of them were
Frank Sinatra, Jo Stafford, Con-
nie Haines, and the Pied Pipers.

‘Dorsey also played semi-jazz

with a small group from the»

band known as the “Clambake

Computer Machine

For“ Research Aid

By ESTHER MISI-IELEVICH

Keeping abreast of the elec-
tronic age, the University of
Pittsburgh has recently ac-
quired a Type 650 Magnetic

Drum Data-Processing Ma-
chine.

This IBMimachine, housed in
825 Cl., former Pitt News ofﬁce,
has almost as many parts as its
title. A computer, it has accom-
panying equipment to punch, re-

that are swept through its mys-
terious insides.
Problems Solved

With the ﬂashing of lights and
a steady hum, it solves problems
in science, business—any kind of
research in which a large amount
of information» is involved.

Through the efforts of a special
committee, this electronic brain
was installed at Pitt at the be-
ginning of the semester.

D. G. Schindler, assistant pro-
fessor of electrical engineering,
and Samuel G. Hanna, assistant

‘ professor of mathematics and of
business research, have been re-
sponsible for its operation.

Professor William Kehl, from
Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, will become_ director of
the Computation and Data Pro-
cessing Center when he arrives
next week.

Aids Researchers

By training people in the use of
this machine, said Mr. Hanna, the
University hopes to conduct re-
search in computing and to help
otherswith research problems in
their ﬁelds.

little longer for the other arith-
meticﬂoperations. The really
time-consuming process involv-
ed is programming the material
to be used in solving a pro-
blem.

Programming entails translating
the physical problems into a
“language” which the machine can
understand. The time involved
varies with the complexity of the
problem being solved. A certain
problem originally taking four
months can now be ﬁnished in ten
minutes, after programming.

Payroll Prepared

Programs, once completed, can

be used repeatedly, as with a

 

l

payroll, which can now be ﬁgured
in one hour instead of the usual
one to two weeks. .
Inside 825 CI., almost all of
the equipment is a battleship
gray, including the metal coat
rack. The room is noticeably
cool; air conditioning is neces-
sary to maintain a constant
temperature for the proper op-
eration of the electron tubes.
There are courses for both stu-
dents and faculty in the use of
this computer. A prerequisite is

laurels last weekend as, the
Physical Education Club won
the city championship trophy
for six—man touch football by

‘routing Carnegie Tech, 46-6.

A large Tech crowd watched the
teams play under the lights on a

'_muddy ﬁeld. The slow ﬁeld forced

the Phys Ed’ club into a passing
game. Five touchdowns were
scored via the air lanes while
only two were scored on the

. ground.

Bill Hamilton was the big gun
in the locals’ attack with four
touchdowns on two short passes
and two pass interceptions of 30
and 40 yards. '

Jack Douglas tallied twice on
pass plays. The ﬁrst score came
on a 60-yard aerial from Bill Hala-
yak with the second six-pointer
recorded on a ten-yard pass.

Bob Shearer also contributed to
the cause by sharing a short pass
from Halayak on the 15-yard line
and faking out two Tech men on
the nine-yard marker before cross-
ing the goal line.

Freshman Pleads Fifth Amendment

By CHRIS GILLOTTI

\ With the exception of one
freshman, the entire student
body was pleased by the re-
cent announcement of Georgia
Tech’s acceptance of a Gator
Bowl bid.   '

The lone exception was Walt
Overby, Pre-Med ’60. Walt’s
trouble is that he is a native of
Metter, Georgia, a small town just
south of Atlanta, the home of
Georgia Tech.

Before this year, he was an
almost violently rabid fan of
the Engineers; but with his
coming to Pitt, he . naturally
transferred some of his alle-
giance to the Panthers, in the
face of so-called “Friendly per-
suasion.”

However, when the Jacksonville

loves. Should he give in to the
spirit of the South which had
"guided his loyalty for his first 18
years and root for the Ramblin’
Wrecks or protect his neck and
cheer for the Golden Cats.

Since the urge to survive some-
what overbalances Southern chiv-
alry, Walt will be on the Pitt side
of the Gator Bowl come Dec. 29.

In reality, Walt is ﬁnding the
adjustment to northern life, a
bit difficult. As he puts it “The
people up heah are in too dawg-
gone much of a hurry. Down
South we don’t run from the
sheriff as fast you all go to

Waiting as usual until the sec-
ond half before unleashing their
winning attack, th e Panthers
brought their final record to sev-
en wins, two losses, and one tie——-
thé best slate a local team has
completed since the 1938 squad
nished with an 8-2 mark. In that
season the present Panther men-
tor was the assistant backfield
coach.

For two weeks the Blue and
Gold coaching staff and players
had heard nothing but how great
a’ defense and offense the South-
erners had. As of today, they are
still looking for them.

-Bosseler Misses Record

Miami could" grind out a total
of only 181 yards, far below their
previous game average which is
tops in the nation. And the Pan-
ther backs and ends raked the
best defense in the country for
279 yards.

As they did with Syracuse's
All-American back, Jimmy
Brown, - Michelosen’s rugged
linemen, both ﬁrst and second
string, stopped captain and full-
back-halfback Don Bosseler. In
this, his last game, Bosseler was
after two Miami .records--sea-
son and career rushing. The 46
yards he gained fell short of
both.

Just as the Htirricane broke
the scoring ice in the last minute
of the ﬁrst half, the Jungle Cats
won in the waning minutes of the
game. Starting with approximate-
ly six minutes left, the victors
marched 63 yards for the winning
six-pointer.

Jelic Star

By MURRAY CHASS
Amidst all the glory, pageantry and atmosphere of a
post-season bowl game, the best team in the East—in most
minds except those of the Lambert selectors—-—-John Michelo-
sen’s Panthers, closed out their regular season schedule by
‘upsetting the previously undefeated Miami Hurricanes, 14-7,

Saturday afternoon before 38,000 shirt-sleeved fans in the
‘ O

own 49 to Miami’s three.

Amby Bagamery and Ray Di-
Pasquale took it to the one and
-then second-string quarterback
Darrell Lewis sneaked over for
the score. Bagamery added the
ﬁnal touch with his second extra
point of the contest.

The Hurricanes got off to a '7-0'
lead with .52 seconds remaining
in the second period. Up until
then, the ball had changed hands
as many times as a coquette
changes men. It was on this drive
only that Bosseler showed any
proof of his All-American status“;

Jelic Sparks Drive

With Bosseler grinding out the
yardage, the Floridans moved to
the Panther 39. Quarterback Sam
Scarnecchia pitched out to Joe
Plevel who scampered to the 11.
Then a pass interefernce call put
the ball on the two. After a Pan-
ther offside, Scarnecchia plough-
ed into the end zone and Ed Oliv-
er converted.

‘ The Panthers, who donned their
light uniforms for the nationally-

televised affair, seemed to be pep-

ped up by the colorful halftime
show and it took them no more

than eight plays to stalmate the’-

tussle. ‘ “'\4

Another fullbalk, Ralph Jelic,
the leading ground-gainer of the
game, sparkplugged this drive.

, His best effort, a 23-yarder, put

the ball on the six, and four
plays later versatile Corny Sal-
vaterra plunged over from the
one.

This marked the first time a
Hurricane opponent had tallied in
the third period; and the fourth
quarter TD broke the hosts’ string
of giving up no more than one
score per game as well as their
14 game unbeaten streak.

Fullbacks Tom Jenkins and Ralph Jelic went into the
Miami game without experiencing how it feels to lug the
football across the goal line nine previous games. When
the ﬁnal whistle had sounded" after the Blue and Gold
startled the powerful Miami Hurricanes, 14-7, they still
hadn’t crossed the payoff line. One thingyis certain, though;

they stole the thunder from Miami’s All-America, fullback Don"

Bosseler. . A
Bosseler, hampered by injuries "in the second half, picked up

( ‘41 yards in nine drives plus uncountable yards when he hit the
TDPanther forward: wall without the ba1l—the paramount requirement

of Coach Andy Gustafson’s drive series.

7 Meanwhile Jelic rambled for 62 yards in eight attempts.
Most’ of iJelic’s yardage came on the_ draw play through the
middle’of the best defensive forward wall in the nation. When
the Jungle Cats needed the yardage in crucial situations it was
Jelic on the draw play, sometimes on the cross-buck. The Flori-
dans just couldn’t stop him on the key plays. Hi srunning mate

6 at the fullback post—Jenkins-—carried ﬁve times for 59 yards. The
East Liverpool senior garnered 48 of his 59 yards in a dazzling
dash to the Miami six-yard line. ,,.This run set up the eventual
winning touchdown in‘ the last period.

When querried why he did not keep going for the corner of the
end-zone instead of reversing for midﬁeld when he got to the ten

~._.,:Ienkins said, “I ﬁgured if I didn’t cut back Ed Oliver might catch
' me. I played with him in high school and he has tremendous speed.

By cutting back there appeared a ch-ance that I could break into
the clear again. If I’d gone straight for the sideline I might have
been able to stumble into the end-zone though.”

The Panthers had an earlier opportunity to break the 7-7 dead-
lock when they drove inside the Miami 20 midway in the last
quarter. On a fourth down with sizable yardage necessary to move
the sticks, Coach John Michelosen elected to ‘try for the ﬁrst down.
It was fruitless. Many thought they should have kicked a ﬁeld
goal. Quarterback Corny Salvaterra had the same thoughts. Before
the play started ‘he signaled Michelosen.with a practice kick. The
Panther coach nodded in disagreement. This was the sign to try
for the ﬁrst ‘down. ' '

After the game Michelosen said, “We did not attempt a ﬁeld
goal because we wanted to keep the ball inside the 20 and give '
them less operating room if we lost possession of it. There was

‘We still had plenty of time to get possession of the ball again.”

He was right. The Blue and Gold came to win, 14.-7, as the
late-evening shadows drifted across the playing ﬁeld. Miami fans

tight’ but with experience they
will be more relaxed.” , _,
The Panther mentor thinks the
team is improving. Peterson was
also ‘satisﬁed by the fact that they
“took the good one” when shoot-

Peterson further added, “If they
continue to control the ball and

shoot the way they did in the ﬁrst

they will give most of the teams

The season slate now stands
at one win and one loss.

10 a.m. until noon, sorority

their time to aid in the 1956
Muscular Dystrophy cam-
paign.

About 50 sorority women held
a “tag day.” The girls collected
funds on street corners in about
seven districts of the city with

cannisters, and passed out poppies
to everyone who contributed.

Four lﬁundred fraternity men
traveled in groups — of ten
throughout the city, and picked
up all contributions which wom-

THE HOUSE 'l'HAT
JET ENGINES BUILT

Engineers and scientists at Pratt 82 Whitney Aircraft
developed the piston engines that wrote aviation history

for three decades. Then came the jet age, and again it '

was the P & W A team that came up with the mighty

J -57, most powerful production aircraft engine in the

world today. Behind such accomplishments, of course,

stand many development tools...tools like the house that

jet engines built: the Andrew Willgoos Laboratory.

Located on the eastern bank of the Connecticut River

in East Hartford, this windowless, thick concrete-walled : .
laboratory has been growing almost continuously since

its initial “completion” in 1950. As more powerful, far

more advanced turbojet engines are conceived, the means

for testing them in development stages must itself under-

go carefully calculated alteration. Hence, authorship of
today’s speciﬁcations for Willgoos Laboratory properly
belongs to the experimental engines it is testing today.
Similarly,. tomorrow's proportions, capacities and equip-

ment will depend upon the requirements of tomorrow’s

power plants.
Behind the ponderous walls of this multi-million-dollar
structure lies the wherewithal to simulate many of the
rigorous ﬂight conditions to be encountered by military
and commercial aircraft. The range of these conditions
must vary from ambient pressures and temperatures in
a static condition at sea level all the way to the pres-
sures, temperatures and high speeds involved in high-
altitude ﬂight.
