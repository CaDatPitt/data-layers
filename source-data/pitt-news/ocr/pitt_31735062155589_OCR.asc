President Prominent

Edwards, the new president, is one
of the most prominent undergradu-
ates on the campu_s,_ hav1ng'.i3-Vd1V€_1"
siﬁed list of activities to his credit.
For the past three years. he has
been a member of the varsity foot-
ball squad, and participated  both
the Leland Stanford and University
of Southern California Tournament
of Roses games. . . ‘

He has also served as a member
of 3. Pepper Prize committee, was
president of the College during his
sophomore year, a member of

Druids, a member of last year’s Den-,

tal Student Council and ajinember
of both Delta’ Tau Delta social fra-
ternity and Psi Omega, national den-

_ 15 Happy —

In a statement to the Weekly

upon his election, Edwards said: “I

am naturally happy at my ‘election

and shall do everything possible to
preside. over a progressive council
group next year. The ‘general
school elections have resulted most
fortunately, giving Council a repre-
sentative and active. membership.
Speciﬁcally, there are two things 1
should like to see Council _develop
next year. These are the establish-
me of a Men’s Self Governing As’-
soci tion and an investigation com-
mittee with increased powers.”_
Gerald Collins, retiring‘ head,
said: “As the outgoing president of
Student Council, I want to wish the
new council much success, and hope
that the student body will support
them in all of their undertakings.”

Reject UseiOf Falk
Clinic As Inﬁrmary

.The extensive plans submitted to

administration oﬂicials by the W. s.

G. A. housing committee earlier in
the year proposing the use of a wing
of the Fall: clinic, now under con-
struction, for a student inﬁrmary.
will not be realized this year.

_ The proposal was rejected by Dr.
E. M. Frost, director of student
health, and Dr. R. R. Huggins, dean
of school of medicine, on the grounds
that the clinic is to be for ambula-
tory purposes only. Both men com-'
mended themovement and encour-
aged further acfion of the housing
fuiiiiiiittee in seeking inﬁrmary facil-
ities next year.

The move came about as a result
of an investigation in both men’s
and Women’s fraternity and student
houses which indicated overcrowded
living. conditions and inability of the

houses to accommodate students dur-

ing long illness.

Jane-Ellen Ball, '27, seems a
happy choice as chairman. of the
program committee for the Sunset
Dinner scheduled for Saturday,

Ellen's specialty is dramatic art;
her studio is in Knoxville. As part
of her vocation she. coaches‘ the Pltt
Players at the University, and ar-
ranges programs for ‘radio, some-
times play-acting herself, some-»
times coaching. As a sideline, _sh_e
enjoys her family and its resources
in their ‘interest in the aircraft
game. Isn't it -fate ‘then that we
shall have a program. which .will
combine drama (even ifit be _meller-
-drama) and radio and airslups for
the Sunset Dinner?

you may rest" assured that it will
be all worth «whilefcoming for on

of the peppiest and biggest reun-
ions the Sunset Dinner ever enter-
tained. Marjory Stewart (she of
radio fame) is handling th.e*pro-
gram and stunts for this reunion
and that fact is all the recommenda-
tion the program needs. Others on
the committee are Katherine Fin-
lay, Helena Ivory, Anna W. Kling-
ensmith, and one other, not yet an-
nounced. The, committee has been
writing letters to out of town -menu-.
bers of ‘their class and is hopeful of.
a. great many £espAonses‘- in person.‘ 

Evelyn McCurdy is’ another per-
son who has been busy writing out
of town letters. She reports that

of making‘ the’ trip from her home

West Virginia will have to watch
Panthers coasting to points’ in the
dashes, watch Utterback piling up
‘points in his specialties, and battle
orpoints in the hurdles, but in the
weights and distance events Coach
Smith's men will do more than their
share of point gathering. This is
the one big reason why Pitt will en-
ter the meet as the underdog. Hill,
Mountaineer weight star, is good
enough to take ﬁrsts in the hammer
and discus. Plaster and Goldstein
are two more weight men par ex-

cellence, and will -follow Hill in 5
rolling up more points for the;.West ,

Virginians.

runs and more points. are. due. to
trickle Smithward.

All in all, the meet will be close:

going a little tougher than last
week. At the Carnegie Tech meet
there were fewer onlookers than
there are boys in a fraternity
house on a Friday night, but the
West Virginia team will offer» con-
siderably more entertainment than
the Skibos and tomorrow’s meet will
be one of the season’s best, so it

Ev‘--‘and West Virginia should ﬁnd. the

 

will be well worth any one’s time, —

"to watch the ‘Mountaineers and"
Panthers go through their paces at
the stadium tomorrow afternoon.

The Campus Scout

_By J. LEONARD SOLOMONI
At‘ last you know!
Fully determined to pass‘ out of
the picture with the same quietude
and secrecy which raised me from

an insignificant sports writer to the
most talked off and widely‘ read
columnist in the history of the Pitt
Weekly (Try This On Your Piano.
and Pink‘ Tea, included) ,1. your Scout
was forced to surrender to the de-
mands of the new editor and disclose
his identity in this ﬁnal column
written by the ﬁrst and perhaps last
Campus Scout.
__o_

The new fancy makeup sur-
rounding -my last column sort of
makes me feel out ofvplace. A
great injustice’ has been done

the Scout in that he has not "
been permitted to sign oﬂ’ for
good amidst familiar surround-
ings., But the old’ must make
Way for the new. VYesterday,II
took my last examination, paid
my graduation fee, got ﬁtted up
for my Cap and Gown, and to-
day am standing on the brink
of. the outer business world,..pa-
tiently waiting for the B.S. de-
gree with which to launch into
the more ‘nature world and bat-
tle for a living. ’ ' 
.——o_.+
Now is the time for reminiscences,
but these would occasion mingled
feelings and sentimentalities which
your Scout has never had any...use
for. But dear readers, this being
the last “Campus Scout,” it does

give me great pleasure to come_:V;be- it

fore you the last time with the mask
removed,‘as the associate editor of
the Pitt Weekly, having been sports
editor of this rag for three years
previous, as business manager of. the

Owl for the past two years (there’s

where the Owl publicity has pen-
tered) and as editor of the" Sport
Shop in the Panther for the past

two years. Some of the boys over ’

at the Pi Lam house call me Jay,
some Len, some Scout, and some
Salomy; but the one and only official
autograph of your Scout is just as it
has been written by the Managing
Editor at the top of this column.

j It is diﬁicult at this ‘time to
explain just wherein my suc-
cess has lain, but those predic-
tions about the football scores,

purely a matter of luck, and the
little bits of gossip about cam-
pus athletics all contributed in
some measure.» , I _
. —o-— .
The history of. this column» dates
back four years. When a freshman,
I contributed to “Panther Patter,”
the sports column.th‘en.V In my sec-
ond year, the Weeklyeditor, a cer-
tain young man from Clairton,

thought sport columns were taboo.‘

Then came my junior year and I
was determined to write -a"column.
With the kind aid of Don Saunders.
I concocted the name “The Campus.
Scout.” The immediate and lasting

success of this venture is history.

._o—. ‘ V
So much for the usual bally-
hoo and bologna ; that has al-
ways -Vmarked. this column, al-
ways written in: a. happy_-gm
lucky manner, never serious,
and very seldom sincere. Sports
as awhole are not serious to me
and never shall be. They are
just a, toy for those who par-
ticipate in them and for-Vthose
who watch them. For the
writer theyare acmeans of en-
tertainment and a —means of
earning a living. '
. -—-o-—

But why let those thoughts crop
upnow? For twolyears I have re-
strained these candid opinions and
now is no time to toss them off to
my many» readers. Every student

should have his own opinionabout
