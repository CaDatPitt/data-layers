Sgt. Dolierty -
Receives 2nd

Commendation

Master Sergeant James T. Do-
herty,_ manager of the Pitt rifle
team,» has been awarded an Oak
Leaf cluster t.o the Army Com-
mendation ribbon which he re-
ceived last year. The second ci-
like t‘he original, was
awarded for a suggestion which
was submitted by the sergeant
and adopted by the armed forces,
and which brought about an im-
provement in some phase of its‘
operations.

‘Sergeant Doherty hes distin-

guished himself in his capacity as

manager of the riﬂe team h.ere.

‘The Pitt riﬂe teams of 1945 and

1946 placed first in the national
championship matches, and in both
instances the teams werecoached
bysergeant Doherty. During the
history, of Pitt’s ROTC
unit, the riﬂe team; previously had
managedwto place only second and
third. .

The sergeant served three years
overseas in the Indian and Iraneani
theaters with the military mission
to Russia. Suffering injuries in

‘the line of duty, helwas. returned

to the states. He was stationed
here with the local ROTC.unit'
until discharged. in January. 1946.

His attempt to reenlist met with
diﬂiculties, but _a petition
Washington from. 200 Pitt students
in his behalf was successful; and
the_ capable and popular soldier
returned to the campus.

arship, to squeeze out a ten point
Win over the defending PiKAs.
The All-point trophy is award-
ed annually by the IF Council to

V the fraternity having the highest

number of points in scholarship,
sing, and sports.

Previous winners of the All-
Point trophy were the Kappa Sig
fraternity in 1937-38, and the Phi
Delta Thetas in 1938-39.‘ Last
year a strong PiKA fraternity car-
ried the award home with them.

Speaker Stresses
World Government

“Wars are inevitable only if
people do not advance the idea
of world government,” said Col-
gate S. Prentice, Student Federal-
ist president, at the Pitkin club
meeting last Wednesday.

He stressed the point that ‘‘scien_
tific advancement has made‘ war
so destructive that the world can-
not stand another war. We are liv-
ing in a rotten world held to-
gether because it is handled care-
fully. The solution for world
peace is world government.”

At the next club meeting, No-
vember 13,6 p. m. at the Shady-
side Presbyterian church, Olga
Rukavina, chairman of the World
Student Christian federation, will
speak of. her experiences in Eu-
-rope, while a delegate to the in-

 ternational student conference.

The

Application blanks may be
obtained from the offices of the

tions of business manager, gen-
eral chairman, and committee
chairmen for the Spring Festi-
val. All blanks are to be re-
turned to either office before

For years sororities have been

maybe that is good; but can_ you

Coeds Agree

“Don’t be afraid to strike up a

ﬁve co-edsmat Y Men’s club meet-
ing last week. Betty Flanagan,
Margie Walko, Mary Jane Duns-
moor, Lou Juidish, and Olga Ru-

kavina said that there is no man. A

more likeable than a friendly one.
The women gauged Pitt men on

‘four main points:
1. Manners — Although men L

must hurry to classes too, many
of them allow women to enter and
leave the elevator ﬁrst.

2. Clothes-—The general appear-

ance of men at Pitt is exceptional-- .

ly neat.

3. Scholastic abi1ity— We hear
from the professors that Pitt men
have brains. We like that.

4. School spirit-—Man;« of the
men do not know the Alma Mater
or football cheers. We don't like
that. '

“Veterans have improved the
appearance of men at Pitt. It is
a great change from what it used
to be,” said the women. The ﬁve
co-eds spoke for an hour on man-
ners, clothes, scholastic ability,
and school spirit. Before the meet-
ing closed, they summed up by
confessing “Conﬁdentially, we like

Pitt men, because they are men.”

Buck Passes Stop Pitt

Although Ohio State’s highly-

touted ground attack was stopped,

cold, a 202-pound freshman back
passed the Buck's to a thrilling
20-13 victory over Pitt at Colum-
bus last Saturday afternoon.

The culprit was George Spen-
cer, a Columbus boy, who not too
many weeks ago had settled him-
self on the Ohio “B” squad.

The Panthers drew ﬁrst blood

in the second frame on a pass,‘

from Lou Cecconi to Bill McPeak
in the end zone. Not too many
minutes after, the Bucks came to
life and worked the ball to the

One second is not always one-sixtieth of a 1ninute—not in tele-
phone mathematics. Suppose, for example, you ﬁnd a new method
that clips just one second from the time it takes to process a toll

ticket. Then apply that saving throughout the Bell System where
some 115,000,000 toll tickets are handled a month. The time saved
every thirty days equals 3% years!

Important? From seemingly minor changes or savings frequently

come the major improvements which mean better working conditions

for telephone men and women ‘and better telephone service for

everyone.

In-this industry, even“ long established methods of operation are
never considered beyond improvement. For men with ideas and
ability, that viewpoint is a stimulating challenge.

A Spencer to Brugge pass put

the—Pitt eleven scored on a quar-
terback sneak by Cecconi. How-

snuffed out for the time being as

The Panther “B” eleven went
down to defeat be:-ore the Ohio
State junior varsity squad last
Friday afternoon by a decisive
count of 28-7. . /

It marked the second time this
season that the Buck juniors de
cisioned the Pitt cubs, the pre-
vious tally standing at 32-8. " W

The contest was staged at the
Veteran’s Hospital at Aspinwall
before a» throng of servicemen. 4 ‘

The lone Panther touchdown
was made by Bob Hum, a fresh-‘
man back who was lend-leased
from the varsity for this tilt.
