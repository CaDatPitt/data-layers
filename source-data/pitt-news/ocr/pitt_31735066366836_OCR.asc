Dr.   Berkowitz Asserts Existence
  Of Large “Frightening Numbers

By ROBERT ZAVOS
Dr. Morris Berkowitz, as-
sociate professor of sociolo-
gy, asserted. that “there is

a frightening number of an-‘

ti-intellectuals at American
universities” at the Phi Eta
Sigma Smoker Monday night in
the Student Union.

He began his address by stat-

ing that Phi Eta Sigma might not w

really be an organization of in-

tellectuals, but rather an organi-.

zation of young men who have
conquered the game of grades-
manship with good success.

“In the modern American uni-
versity the key to good grades is
faith,” he said. By faith he. meant

” the belief that ‘textbooks and pro-

 

fessors are always absolutely and

" unequivocally right. Students who

get good grades are those who
know how to accept and then
regurgitate the material from
their textbooks and professors.

Dr. Berkowitz stated that “most
intellectuals get bad grades.” The
intellectuals are those who have
no faith and who question" their
books and professors.

He said, “the worst group of

anti-intellectuals is the students.”

They demand three things from

their professors which are anti-
thetical to intellectualism. First,
they want a clear, concise course
outline. They want to know ex-
actly how many pages they have
to read each week.

Second, they want to use a
textbook. “Textbooks are easy,
but they only give a talkative

-ability in a subject.” They offer

no real understanding. Finally,
‘students object when a professor
deviates from the assigned ‘ma-
terial. When he starts talking
about what‘ he thinks of some-
thing, they complain. —

owitz. They seek order, not mo-
bility, because order is easier to
administer. But, intellectualism
implies disorder and questioning.
Female students aren’t allowed
self-discipline and students aren’t
allowed to allocate their own
money because problems might
arise and there would ‘be dis-
order.

Pitt Preview Committee sets
s Program Sc

The Pitt Preview Committee,
under the chairmanship of Bar-
bara Elman, has released the
schedule of events for thisiSat-
urday’so program. The aim of the
Preview is to present a picture
of University life to prospective
freshmen. .

.'I_[he hosts and hostesses wil
meet with the visiting high school
seniors in the Schenley Hall cafe-
teria from... 9 to 9:30 Saturday
morning. A brief program, lasting
until 10:15 p.m., will be given in ,-
the Stephen Foster Memorial. Jim
Smith, Inter-Fraternity Council
Man of the Year, . and Jack
Critchﬁeld, dean of admissions,
will be the speakers.-From 10:30
to 11:30 p.m., the students will
attend one of 20 different sched-
uled classes. A lunch with the

University studerft body in the,

Towers Cafeteria will follow.

The afternoon activities, from
1:30 to 4, will take place in the

Am   erica
14, 16, or some other convenient
number of weeks. They also like
_to' “package students.” Students
with -so many credits can only
take certain courses, and with
different numbers of credits they
must take other courses. He cited,
the 80 and 180 courses at the
University. ,

“The third group of anti-intel-
Iectuals is the poor old profes-
sors,” continued Dr. Berkowitz.
There are three areas in which
their anti-intellectualism is ap-
parent. First, they like to \pack-
age knowledge into disciplinary
packages. A political science pro-
fessor, a history professor, and a
sociology professor must all deal
with a topic from their own par-
ticular point of view. They don’t
dare to, transpose into another
discipline.

The second anti-intellectual
characteristic of professors is-
\their reverence for the old mas-
ters in their ‘ﬁelds. Any paper
without the requisite number of
footnotes from the masters is sub-
ject to rejection. Dr. Berkowitz
quipped that one shouldn’t go
into sociology unless he is pre-
pared to quote from Weber, Durk-
heim, or a few others.

The third characteristic is the
tendency to present facts in their
lectures which could just as well
have been read out of any book.

Dr. Berkowitz ‘concluded by
warning that-we must be on the
lookout‘ to preserve the freedom
to be wrong.- At times we 'must

Business
Conference

Scheduled

For seven months now, the
Graduate School of Business has
operated a unique conference-

course-lecture program for its-

faculty. The program, consisting

M of lectures by prominent men in

diverse ﬁelds, provides a forum
where controversial issues can be
aired and a means by which vac-
uums in the school’s curriculum
can. be ﬁlled, according to ‘Dr.

James Wilson, assistant dean-of L

the school.

Lectures are given once a week
and past speakers have included
members of the John Birch So-
ciety, Peace ,Corps volunteers,

various religious leaders, educa-
.tors, and successful businessmen.

The speakers may choose their
own topic for discussion and are
not required to relate that topic
to business. This procedure allows
“freshvair from the outside to
come into the sometimes closed
atmosphere of the graduate
school,” noted Dr. Wilson.

Though the“prograrn carries no
credits, attendance at the lectures
is required for students in the
business school. i - -

Dr. Wilson, added that because,
the program is essentially a_ class-
room -situation, the general pub-

    Martin Aids Degree
Program For Nigeria
At NorthernUniversitv

By BERNI McLEOD

In his, public administration-
classes at Ahmadu Bello, north-
ern Nigeria’s largest university,
Dr. Albert Martin, University pro-
fessor of political science, taught
the‘Nigerian elite and men from
villages still existing in the Iron
Age. —

As one of seven University pro-
fessors stationed at Zaria, Ni-
geria, Dr. Martin spent last year
as both a teacher and director
at the Institute of Administra-
tion, part of Ahmadu Bello Uni-
versity. Under a 1962 U.S. State
Department contract, Dr. Martin
helped the Institute develop a
degree program j_n public admin-
istration.

“Because Dean Stone of the

University’s Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs
is well known in Washington,’:
said ,Martin, “the Agency for In-
te-rnal Development, a division of
the State Department, contacted
him to make a survey of condi-
tions at the Institute.” As a re-
sult the program began, with the
American professors working in
cooperation with eight British
and two Nigerian teachers.

“In Nigeria, education is valued
on all levels,’-’ noted Dr. Martin.
Ahmadu ’Bellow at Zaria, was
created by means of several edu-
cational operations such as com-
piling a government clerk_’s school,
a technical uand’agricultural col-
lege and a ﬁne ‘arts school. Once
that was completed, administra-
tors added science, art and agri-

At the present the enrollment
at the Institute is small com-
pared‘ to Americanpstandards for
enrollment in e* school. In addi-
tion, few.wor_nen attend northern‘
universities3:because of Moslem
customs.‘ “The one northern wom-
an that’we have,” noted Dr. Mar-.

.to_be very friendly and under-

tin, “was a convert to Catholic-
ism.”

Although many of Dr. Martin’s
students came from elite fami-
lies in Nigerian society, they by
no means comprised the com-
p1et’e total. “I found most of them

standing,” said‘ Dr. Martin, "‘al_-,
though the Nigerian is a very"
independent minded person.” -

Of the 36 students that ‘have
recently graduated at the end of
their third year, many;,became.
administrators for ‘both the fed-
eral and regional governments.
Others have gone into, business,
or on to graduate work in Amer-
ica or England.

“It was a very‘. good year for
me,” said Dr. Martin, “and I
think we accomplished something
by continuing the development
of a program. Give 3-these stu-
dents ten years,” he added, “and
I’m sure they will be among the
most signiﬁcant citizens of north-
ern Nigeria.” - A

. Dr. Morris Berkowitz’s speech to Phi Eta Sigma Monday night
‘ luminates many interesting points without offering a concrete alterna-

The University should revamp its academic system. Students should
be continued to be admitted to honors programs 38 fI‘€Shmen_- and 35
sophomores if they ‘have shown the necessary academic potential.

V Necessary academic potential would be based on a 3.25 overall
 average in the freshman year with the selection of a major area of study
for the following years. The student would then ‘be admitted to a broad

rent disciplines in the humanities, social, and natural sciences, respectively.

After being admitted to the broad major program, the student would
receive a number of core (required) courses and several open—ended
courses—letting the student read freely from an extensive bibliography
dealing with the major topic. Six credits each term would be based on the
openaended course, having a paper with an original topic and seminar-
type discussions as the basis for the grade.

world community. U. N. Sec-
retary-General U Thant saw
the outcome of this as a
case of “neurosis.” At a re-
cent Press Conference he

stated, “When a country has ‘

been treated like a culprit
and an outlaw, it is apt to
act in a strange way.”
CHINA’S CRIME was that
it was reuniﬁed and strength-
ened under communism.
VVouldn’t the case have been

far worse had the reuniﬁca- I

tion come about under crude
nationalism as was the case
of Japan and Germany? Who
can forget the disasterous
consequences of German Na-
zism or Japanese aggression
as in the bombing of Pearl
Harbor? Has not Marxism
been a restraint as well as
an incentive to action in the
case of ' China. \
Mr. McNamara argues that
‘.‘yelIow peril” has a

and that China feels that the
key to progress lies in its
own experiences. It has be-
come increasingly apparent
that there is no universal
pattern as far as this is con-
cerned. Thevnewspapers are
so full of “setbacks” for
China in various parts of the
world. The way for the West
to deal ‘with this revolution-
ary zeal is to react to the

individual needs of each
country. «

Some of them may be all
the better off with a social
revolution and it would be
just as well for the U.S. to
accept this. Why make a
present of it to be China?

~ When it comes to overthrow-
ing governments, who can
deny that the’American rec-

ord /is far more impressive‘
than that of "the Chinese? 

AS MR. McNAMARA re-
cently pointed out, things
may be far more worse..in
the future. China will prob.-
ably have the delivery. sys-
tem for its nuclear weapons

in some three years. No one
can stop China if it is deter- v

mined to do so. The surest
way to increase its determin-
ation would be to follow the
present policy, of hostility
and ostracism.

There is still time. Amer-
ica can still make sure that
it does not have to repent as
in the case of Vietnam—for
having left, things too late.
And the "punishment this

I time would be far more cruel
and far-reaching. Why not
utilize the time still at hand?
It is time the Administration
followed certain constructive
policies. The ﬁrst step should
be the recognition of main-
land China. ’ '

Such an alternative is necessarily incomplete on details and has
several rough points. Nevertheless it contains ideas for changing a trend
which is antithetical to education.

Complaining about the anti-intellectualism trend is good——_it may
agitate action. But faculty and student suggestions, in concrete forms,
for alternative‘ teaching and administrative policies, and program will
be the catalyst for any constructive action against anti-‘intellectualism.

 Clarifies ' Article
Editor, The Pitt News:

In reference to your interesting

article, “Dr. MacLeod Now an
.‘Insider’ After Teaching in Ecu-

ador,’ (March 9). I would like to-

-clarify some minor points:
1. The article begins:
two years of teaching English and
history at the University of Ecu-
ador, Dr. Murdo MacCleod . . _.”
First of all, I would like to point
out that it was our pleasure to
have Mr. MacLeod teaching at
Central University in Quito,
which, by the way, happens to be
one of the oldest academic insti-
tutions in the Western Hemis-
phere. Central U. is also, just
' one of the various institutions of
high learning in Ecuador, but
there is not as yet, such an insti-
tution as the “University of Ecu-
ador,” although the idea is quite
appealing. : -

2. The article continues: ,“In a
country where so many people
are indifferent toward the United
States, the student group is an
exception. Generally anti-Ameri-

‘ can, they charge the U. S. with

being materialistic.” i
In the ﬁrst place, and as a

consequence of a dynamic pro-

gram by the U. S. Information

Agency and other U. S. agencies, a

the general public is not, and
cannot be, “indifferent” toward
the U.S. The people do have, one
way or another, their own per-
ception of the U. S. presence in
Ecudador. . '

“After ‘

u‘.

the Editor   i

_ Secondly, the student group is
not, and has never been, “anti-
American." This is not only a
misnomer, but it doesn’t reﬂect
the real attitude towards U. S.
nationals. Ecuadorian students
have traditionally been pro-Amer-
ican, because they have always
perceived themselves as/being
Americans, as much as .Argen-
tinians, Mexicans and Canadians,
do. '

On the other hand, they have
always been quite vocal and ac-
tive in regard to some of the U.S.
Government policies in Latin
America. They have indeed dis-
agreed, as do students the world

over, with policies which clash .~

with their idealistic philosophies.
But, beyond this ﬁeld, I believe
that.there have not been major
disagreements and Ecuadorian
students have traditionally wel-
comed U. S. nationals, As —a mat-
ter of fact, Central U. has, for
/quite a number of years, wel-
comed students and professors
-from the U.S. who have attended

its Summer Language Seminars’

in every increasing numbers.
Every summer Ecuadorians have
also the pleasure of being hosts
to quite a number of U.S. high

school students, who visit Ecua- .

0101‘ as members of the various
exchange programs. Had the gen-
eral attitude and atmosphere been

one of anti-U.S. sentiment, this.

sort of academic and social ac-

tivities would have been rather.

difficult to conduct.

The University Greeks
woke up Sunday morning (or
afternoon, or evening) to the
realization that their Week
was over. Not for‘ another year
would they see chariots charge
down Bigelow Boulevard, nor
would their dulcet tones ﬁll the
crevices of Carnegie Music Hall,
nor would they enjoy all the

Rather, the Greeks have to rely
on their memories of What Dy-
anne Hochman, Greek Week co-
chairman, called a week of “tre-7
mendous enthusiasm and parti-
cipation.” This was especially
evident in the blood, drive con-
ducted as a Greek Week service
project. Over 250 Greeks contri-
buted 158 pints of blood. The
Central Blood Bank of Pittsburgh
was very pleased with the results
of the drive, noted Miss Hoch-
man. Alpha Delta Pi and Phi
' Kappa Theta were the respective
sorority and fraternity whose
members contributed the most
blood. — ‘
P_articipation was also evident
in the other events of the week,

BSU Artistcompetition‘ 

Announces Best Work

The Student Union Board
(SUB) Arts Contest was
held in the Lower Lounge
Monday night before an au-
dience of— about 40 artists
and spectators. The contest
was divided into four divisions,
painting, sculpture, graphics, and
photography.

First, second, and _third places
were awarded in each category.
In the painting division, Ken
I-lernandez’s “On the Street Where
You Live” received ﬁrst prize,
Judy Mallin’s “Untitled” was sec-
ond, and Carol Feingold’s un-
titled Work was third.

First place in sculpture went
to Art Rubenﬁeld for his “Park
Bench.” Charles Kaczy took sec-
ond and third places with “Le-
vant” and “Aspiration.”

In graphics, Leonard C. Paulet-
ti received the. ﬁrst place ribbon
for his woodcut “Shopping Bags
Mister?” Bonnie Byrne won-.sec-
and and third with two charcoals,
both of which were untitled.

Finally, in photography, Swasa-
no took ﬁrst place with‘ “The
Youngest Sin.” Ron Shearer took
second with “Nancy,” while Da-
via Haeseler was third with “Geo-
metrics.” All of the works that

made the ﬁnals, including the ’

winners, will -be exhibited in the
Student Union Marble Lounge
this coming week. '

The judges were ﬁne arts teach-
ers from Pittsburgh area high

schools and a "man. associated‘ '

with the Carnegie Museum.

The judging’ was done in two
stages. In the ﬁrst stage the
judges, ‘who were sitting appro-
ximately 15 feet from the paint-
ings, appraised each work as it
‘was presented, and then, with-
out consulting among themselves,
held up a Sign which either said
“inn or “out.”

If two out of the three judges
held up “in,” the painting would
be included in the ﬁnal round

of judging. If there were only
-one or no “ins” the painting was
eliminated.

Speaking of the show in gen-
eral, one of the judges termed it
as being generally “naive.” He
expressed surprise that more of
the students from the ﬁne arts
classes were not entered.

He saw one of the. consequences
of this naivete on the part of the
artists as being ‘A an inability to
produce an honest expression of
their own creativeness. Instead,
they had produced works which
for the most part tried much too
self-consciously to conform to
standard techniques. “There is
no personal commitment,” he
commented.

_i'Next week the senior and‘the

trip. to the National Collegiate

er wrestling tournament, which is
 being held at Iowa State. For

Riley it will be a reward for his
effort in the Easterns. For Wil-
liams it will be a chance to pick
uipwexperience to insure his top
ranking in the East at 191-pounds
that-'is sure to materialize next
year.
‘ How they will do in the na-
. tionals nobody knows. As Riley
says, “‘We might surprise a lot of
people as we did in the Easterns
or we might be eliminated in
the ﬁrst round.”
 As far as Williams is concern-
ed, he just wishes the season was
already over. “I’m falling apart.

,The Easterns really took a lot _

out of me. In terms of grades
' ',_I’m really hurting. Now I under-

stand why so many wrestlers
«ﬂunk out of school.”

Williams, a sophomore, estab-
l_ished himself last weekend as
too valuable to the struggling

‘iwrestling program to be lost be-
 cause of grades. He was the run-
ner-up to Bob Buchwald of Cor-
 nell. Buchwald is a senior and so
‘are the third and fourth place
finishers.
 With a build that resembles
that of a strong man in a circus,
Williams’ talent was originally
thought to lie in football. He re-
ceived a lot more offers to ba-
14 come a quarterback than he did
to become a wrestler. This Uni-

_7,versity wanted him to do both.

' “I told them to forget it,” says
Jack. His performance in the
' Easterns shows he. made the right
choice. He was in a minority of

one concerning his chances, how-
ever.

His coach, Dave Johnson, all
through the season kept saying
that Williams could be good only
if he wanted to be. “My problem
was making him want to,” said
Johnson.

Something made him want to
be last Friday and Saturday.
Those that were most surprised
were those he wrestled. Guido
Carloni, Navy’s top 191-pounder
had pinned Williams in their dual
meet. In theltournament Williams
decisioned him, 13-8.

In the ﬁnals Williams‘ started
off like he had just been shot

from out of a cannon. Buchwald‘s"

face showed his surprise. Jack
was leading 4-1 in the ﬁrst per-
iod and he should have" been
leading 6-1. but the referee. didn’t
award him the two points for a
predicament. '

When "the two points didn’t
come his way, he literally died
on the mat. Buchwald ralliedand
pinned him in the third period.
“I guess I was so excited I forgot
to pace myself,” said Williams,
“and when the ref didn’t give me
the two points for the predica-
ment I fell apart mentally.”

The Panther’s other top wres-
tler, Riley, also failed to make
himself a champion because of a
mental lapse. Losing 3-1, he was
credited with a take down with
only 11 seconds left. His oppon-
ent, Dick DeWalt of Penn State,
escaped several seconds later to
win the match.

Riley explains his loss‘ this way.
“The whole tournament I had
been using the leg hold success-
fully when I was in the up posi-
tion, but when I had used it
against DeWalt earlier he had no
trouble escaping. In those final

seconds I decided to go with a,

tight waist ‘hold instead.

“But he told the referee that
my arm was too tight and I
thought he realized what I was
planning to do. I was trying to

ﬁgure out what to do when the

Riley used to be the type of

  L‘eVieireBuildiRe

By GEORGE LIES
Even over the not so audible public address system at
Trees Hall Pool two names could be heard ringing like
chimes in a cathedral and bringing many a smile to swim-
ming coach Ben Grady. During the season, the two names
bought a touch of glory to a somewhat forgotten (losing)

team.

Their first names are quite common, but in the next
two years, a few people will remember John Lane and Joe

LaViere.
Up from a freshman team which
broke 12 of 16 freshmen records,

these two sophomores had quite

a time. Winning in meet after
meet, and ﬁnally landing in the
Easterns at Navy last week (along
with diver Don Hahnfeldt), Lane
and LeViere made themselves a
name. '

For Lane, it was a hard busi-
ness, swimming. “Last year I had
a two month break,” he said, “and
it wasthe ﬁrst time in four years.
‘Besides swimming in high school
for three years, I swam in a lot of
AAU and YMCA meets. And this
season, I was pressing myself
very hard.”

In New Rochelle, New York, as
a high school sophomore, Lane
swam backstroke but as a junior
he was the county champion in
the ‘individual medley. So when
he competes for the mermen,-‘he
swims freestyle.

“I could still swim a strong
medley, but I’ll leave that to the
freshmen team,” Lane said.

The school record for the 200-
yard freestyle is 1:50;4 held by
Robert Levine. Lan_e’s best time
this past season was 1:51.3,' but
he plans to break the mark. “In
the last two years, I have low-

ered my time four seconds each

Fisher Sinks Clutch Fouls

--4-~

  

..mers and he

year,” he said. “I am going to
try to get the school record next
season.”

One factor which kept Lane
from reaching his goal this year
was his time over‘ the ﬁrst 100-
yards of the event. “I have’ to
learn to go out faster in the_ early
part of the race. In’order to ﬁn-
ish fast, I must do the ﬁrst_100
in the low :51’s,” he said.

This process of -learning held
true for Lane ever since he
thought of swimming freestyle.
“Backhome, there was a fellow
named Jack Collins who owned
and operated the Badgers Sports
Club where swimmers came from
everywhere to compete,” he said.

“Collins helped a lot of swim-
helped me. He
changed my swimming style from
basically animalistic and ﬁghting
the water to where I could use
my strength for swimming cor-
rectly.” M

Whereas Lane worked to swim
his best, LeViere ..took things
easy. In fact, he could barely
swim the width of his high school
pool as a freshmen. __

“Towards the end of my fresh-
men year of high school, a buddy
interested me in going to a swim-
ming meet after school,” LeViere

‘-7

JOHN LANE
Changed style and now wins.

said. “Well I went; it interested
me and although I could hardy
swim, I told myself I was going
out for the team next year."

LeViere did go out for, the
Langley High swimming team
that next year‘. He. made mistakes,
too. “I think people came to
watch the meets becausetl al-
ways missed my turns,” he said.
“But it was the desire for com-
petition that made me try out
for the team.”

*“In the city league, we had lit-
tle time to practice and I seldom
practiced during the summer
months,” Lane continued. “My
backstroke came casually and

naturally, I guess, because Inev-
er really worked out except for
keeping my arms and shoulders
loose.” _

Next year the two will return.
Probably they will add a little
to their reputations. And prob-
ably they will a little more glory
to the swimming team.

MBA Team WinsChampionship; . I

OutshootPl1i Epsilon Pi, 56 -488.

Brian Fisher stepped to theifoul line as he didmany times for the Panther var-
sity,,last year, and madettwo clutch free throws. With the. score 49-48 in his teams favor
Fisher made two shots that meant the intramural basketball championship for the busi-
ness school‘. The ﬁnal score MBA, 56, Phi Ep, 48. —

The lVlBA.’s led by the hot shooting and strong rebounding of Dave Stephensgwho
le_d all the. scorers with 18 points. His great play around the offensive boards was the big

difference between the two teams.
He fouled out_ with his tearn
ahead by one point, but Fisher’s

two foul shots cinched the ‘game

anyway.

Phi» Ep was behind from ‘ the
start and could just never quite
catch up. They started‘ very slow-
ly falling behind 12-3 midway
through the first quarter. They
came within three points by half-

sig./time, but dropped behind again

in the third quarter. Their fourth
period spurt was due to the shoot-
ing of Buddy Sapolsky, who
startedlhitting for most of his 15
points then.

When Phi Epchanged from a.
man-to-man defense to a zone
they held down the MBA’s re-
bounding’ and
fully. In the third quarter, how-
ever, the business school hit from
the [outside to widen their mar-
