Study abroad programs. stable

Despite the country’s feeble

economy, study-abroad advisers at.
Pitt and three other Pennsylvania ’

colleges and universities said that
they have not yet noticed a decrease
inthe number of students who are
applying to study abroad this year.

I But more students are asking

‘ about the cost at information ses-

sions and are waiting until the last

‘ minute to send deposits for the ap-

plications, said Jennifer Wagner-
Lawlor, director of Penn

State’s P

study-abroad program. A .

“From the beginning of the ,

year, we’ve seen a- lot of caution

‘with students,’’_ she said. f

i i Because of rising concerns that

study—abroad programs might be.

too priceyfor these budget-con-

‘ scious times, colleges across the A

country have come up wim a host
of initiatives to encourage students’
chances to immerse themselvesin
other cultures while earning credits
toward their degrees. From redi-
recting students to cheaper destina-

tions such as Ecuadorand China _-

to incorporating 'study—abroad
costs in their regular tuition, col-
leges want to. encourage study

' abroad while -cutting co’st‘s.Some
‘have eliminated excursions. Others
promote exchange programs. Still-

others redirect students to shorter

programs,‘ said Peggy- Blumenthal,
executive vice president andchief .

Yucas, director’ of the ofﬁce.

Study-"abroad advisers at Pitt and Penn
State are also promoting programs in non-
traditional locations such as Africa or Latin

iAmerica, because these places are cheaper

than Europe or,Australia.
' Like the more traditional study—abroad>

destinations, students can take classes, con-

duct research, complete internships and live"

with native families in non-traditional areas
and often obtain a better understanding of
themselves in relation ‘to the larger world,
said Keely Carney, a sophomore atiPitt who
studied in Ecuador last summer through the

A Center for Latin-‘AmericaniStu'dies. .
“When I went to Ecuador, it was deﬁnitely ',

a family]-first culture,”. said Carney. “There
wasn’t a single morning when my family didn’t
have breakfast or-dinner together, and then I
went home, and it kind of changed how my

little bit.” t \ ‘
Students also think about the values and
beliefs that they are raised with in,Ame1:ica

' cause they obtain the opportunity to test these-
values when they are away from everything J

that is familiar to them, said Kylee Allen, a

Besides eliminating excursions and pro—

- moting non-traditional locations, Penn State ‘

"study-abroad advisers are emphasizing short-
er study-abroad programs,‘ including Penn

State’s embedded and summer programs, i

said Wagner-Lawlor. The report found that

55 percent of American students chose short-

term programs during the 2006-07 year, in-
cluding summer terms and programs of two
to eight weeks. In contrast, about 36 percent

of students spent a_ semester abroad,tand '

fewer than 5 percent-spent a full academic
or calendar year abroad. _
Perhaps the most dramatic university

push for study abioad, however, is happen-
ing at LaRoche College. Beginning this fall, in

all incoming-students have their study-abroad
experiences included in their tuition costs
through the new “Beyond the Classroom
Study Abroad —_ Study USA” program, said

- Tom Schaefer, associate vice president fo

, - 2

academic affairs at LaRoche.
After completing 60 credits, students will

,‘be able to experience a short-term istu.dy- ,

abroad program in Central America, Europe
or Asia, and this program will also be.open
to other students in Pittsburgh who want to
cross-register with LaRoche, he said.
‘_‘It’s  of our mission-statement — the

A tional outreac ,” saidrSchaefer. “One mother
told me that she didn’t have the money if her
daughter wanted to go to China, but now she

 While it’s been decades since World '

 .E1)1'roR1AL__  

G.I. bill addition offers

veterans fair beneﬁts

When the post-World War II
inﬂux of soldiers returned home,
they were granted funds from the
government that could be used for
college education under the G.I. bill.

 War II’s end, the government. still

 issues the GI. bill to veterans to ,

bolster educational expenses.
Under the post—Sept. ll G.I. bill,

the federal government pays partici-

pating schools an amount equal to

 the highest in-state tuition charged
 by a public university in that state.

It also matches the fees of the most
expensive public school in the state.

But here’s a new addition to the -
 bill: the YellowvRibbon Program.

Because the bill only matches the
highest in-state tuition of a public
university, this sum can’t adequate-
ly cover tuition costs of a private
school. The Yellow Ribbon Pro-
gram allows schools to enter into
an agreement with the government

; to fund tuition costs that surpass

 

3 the highest public in-‘state under-

graduate tuition rate. The institution
can contribute up to 50 percent of
those expenses and the government
will match the same amount as the
school.

After Robert Morris University
announced in February that it plans

to join the Yellow Ribbon Program, _

at least eight other private schools
in the area — including Chatham,
Carlow and Seton Hill —— said they

also plan to take part in the program, .
"according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-

Review.

institution, but it can most likely still
use the program to subsidize out—of-
state veterans seeking undergraduate

admission or those enrolling in grad-

uate or professional programs.

Pitt, of course, is not.a private ‘

cational institution.
0

Pitt, however, remains in the :

midst of exploring the program,
according to Pitt spokesman John
Fedele and hasn’t decided yet wheth-
er or not itiplans to enroll in the
progia.m- ‘  

While the Yellow Ribbon Pro-
gram would require Pitt to distrib-
ute more money _— something, the
University undoubtedly wants to
avoid given the‘ tight budget and
uneasy economy —‘- Pitt shouldn’t
mull much longer over whether to
enroll. The University should seek
to adopt the program.‘ "

Pitt already provides a plethora
of scholarships. Given the duty for-
mer soldiers’ performed, this form
of scholarship provides an appro-

priate type of  It’s deﬁnitely

important to remember and support
our troops, but ﬁnancial compensa-
tion provides a concrete, useful form
of gratuity. A

Given that so many other area

‘ "schools plan to adopt the program,

Pitt shouldn’t ostracize itself While
we shouldn’t join solely to follow the

other universities, its refusal could

conversely portray the University in
a negative light  the program’s
intentions merit its acceptance. Yet,
the school should be wary of being
perceived unpattiotically if it denies
the program. A

To the veterans returning home
in search of ‘an education, theyfll
quite possibly circumscribe their
search to schools that offer the
greatest ﬁnancial beneﬁts related
to the G.I. bill. Even, if \ Pitt won’t

receive tuition proﬁts from-these
_ students, the University shouldn’t
make itself unappealing to potential! ‘

Unfortunately, your diligence is

They have-red pens. They get the key‘

RateMyProfessors.com can only go

so far — it’s inevitable that we end up '

with at least one each semester who

does not bother responding to e-rnailg f

very real dilemma: Do we take the
time to write a thorough evaluation or
do we complete it hastily as to escape

Even if a student feels a moral ‘
obligation to ﬁll outthe survey care-
fully, the opportunitylto leave class
early remains an orgasm—inducing
proposition. If you. have any doubts
about this, have a professor walk into
a class 14 minutes late and observe
what happens.

’ There is, however, one inherent
flaw in the current system that neither
we not our professors nor OMET
has control over: Who are we to judge
our professors atthe present?

' We are not scholars of educational

rate for online surveys is far lower
than that of those given in class.
Thus, we often end up fillingout
evaluations toward the end of the se-
mester, when we are inundated with
school work, ‘and hostility toward
professors is at its peak.
Fortunately, the Ol\/[ET surveys
make distinctions that attempt to
neutralize our biases. For example,

I’ve had incompetent professors
who maintained excellent learning
environments. I’ve had thought-stim-
ulating ones who did not evaluate
my work fairly. I’ve had life-changing
instructors who did not present their
courses in an organized manner.
Such distinctions help keep us hon-
est and prevent us from character-

izing professors simply’ as “sucky,”

when they actually make terrific use .’

of examples to clarify concepts.

p Students need more incentive to evaluateprofs

Perhaps what we really need is
some tangible compensation if we
are to consider the surveys seriously.
After all, professors get paid to judge
us responsibly. But what have we ever
gotten in return for evaluating them?
Peace of mind? A sense of moral
balance? I . ' .
