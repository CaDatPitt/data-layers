Panthers acquitted

By Mark A. Slndler
The Pitt News

In consecutive hearings yesterday
afternoon, charges brought against
two Pitt football players were dis-
missed by District Magistrate
Nicholas Diulus.

Freshman defensive back Dante
Wiley agreed before his scheduled
appearance to compensate freshman
John Ashley for facial injuries
reportedly sustained in a dormitory
incident Feb. 2.

According to Wiley’s attorney,
Michael‘Foglia, $721 was paid for
“some hospital bills.” Wiley’s
mother, Geraldine, present when
Diulus dismissed the case, wrote out
a check for that amount. Addition-
ally, Foglia paid the $30.50 court
fee.

Ashley’s counsel, Cheryl Allen
Craig, said it is not uncommon for a
charge of simple assault to be settled
prior to the hearing.

Following the hearing in Diulus’
Atwood Street chambers, Wiley
refused comment.

Wiley was accused of kicking and
hitting Ashley in the face on the 12th
floor of Lothrop Hall.

Earlier in the week, Vice President
of Student Affairs Conney Kimbo
formalized three sanctions recom-
mended by a Judicial Board March
12 against Wiley. A disciplinary
reprimand, expressing disapproval,
will be in effect for four years and
can serve to introduce Wiley’s
record if he is involved in future pro-
ceedings. Kimbo also ordered Wiley
to undergo psychiatric counseling
and provide the restitution Ashley
received yesterday.

Prior to Wiley’s settlement, Diu-
lus found another freshman, wide

receiver Tony Williams, innocent of
a harrassment charge filed by Staci
Camp. The fourth-year junior later
claimed Diulus acquitted the Free-
dom, Pa., native because he is a
Panther.

“I think it is because he is a foot-
ball player,” Camp said. “He was
drunk when the incident happened.
Someone later told him to apologize
and all I wanted him to do was tell
the truth [in court] and apologize.

“The judge bent over backwards
to help because he [is] a football
player.”

“Everyone’s treated the same,"
Diulus responded. “And you can
quote me on this: Everyone is pre-
sumed innocent until proven guilty."

Camp, 21, contended Williams
punched her in the face Feb. 7 out-
side of Lothrop Hall around 8:15
pm’.
“I was coming up to the revolving
door and Tony and four other foot-
ball players were coming out of the
building,” Camp testified. “One of
them stood in front of me. I said
excuse me and tried to go around.

Farrakhan  
  BAS budget approved

By Alison Sterne
The Pitt News

Although the Student Govern-
ment Board was prepared for a
debate on the Black Action Society
budget, they met with little resist-
ance when they approved it at a
meeting Wednesday. The approval
of the budget by a vote of 7-0 with
one abstention permits the BAS to
invite Rev. Louis Farrakhan to
speak at Pitt.

Before the budget was discussed,
SGB president Luke Kluchko said,
“When representing all students, we
must stand for freedom of speech. If
there is one place to express all ideas,
it should be on the university
campus.” L

Kluchko added that although it
may not be desirable that Farrakhan
speak, it is essential to the integrity
of the university — as well as the
students — that he should not be

denied the opportunity to speak

because of personal or religious

views.

The members of the BAS
applauded the remarks of Kluchko.

Only two students expressed their
concern at the meeting on the
approved BAS budget. Charles
Fedel, who identified himself as
independent of affiliation with any
student group, testified to the board

that “controversy is not always.

had,” but controversy should _be
“constructive, not destructive.” He
went on to thank ‘Avery Abrams, the
one board member who had
abstained from voting on the
budget. ‘

Later in the meeting, board
member Dan Taylor introduced a
resolution stipulating that the BAS
“immmediately repudiate in writing
thesentiments and expressions of
hatred reportedly made by Mr.
Farrakhan."

No BAS members were present to
discuss the proposed resolution. It
was approved unanimously.

“BAS does not espouse, advocate
or legitimate any of the ideas or atti-
tudes our lecturers express," Darryl

tions of the Five-year Plan.

The preliminary recommendation
of the plan was that the school be
“phased out starting with the next
academic year.” But plans for the
school have changed.

First, tuition costs will increase,

although the amount of the increase

is not yet available. The need for the
increase, according to the plan is to
help run the school more cost-
effectively.

‘The second major change will be a.
reduction in faculty members, staff
members and teaching assistants.
The plan recommends that six’full-

time faculty members be ‘transferred '

to another part of the university,
that the size of the staff be reduced
and that 13 TA positions be
eliminated.

Another change will be to shorten
full-time faculty contracts from 12
months to nine months (or two
terms).

The fourth cutback will eliminate
the pharmacology department from
the school. H. David Bergman,
assistant dean, explained why the
decision was made. He said: “Phar-
macology deals with how drugs
work in the body, and this depart-
ment is not unique to pharmacy. It
spreads across the Schools of Health
Sciences. There is a department in
the School of Pharmacy, the Dental
School and the School of Medicine.
These will all be merged into the
School of Medicine. So, pharmacol-
ogy will still be taught, but only in
one school.”

The elimination of pharmacology
is the reason the number of faculty

  Freeilegal aid for students offered

By Nadia Moritz
The Pitt News

Free legal services will be availa-
ble to Pitt students for the first time
today. Greensburg attorney Todd
Crawford, sponsored by the Student
Government Board, will conduct 15-
minute counseling sessions in the
SGB office from 2 to 4 p.m. for the
next four Fridays.

“The university needs a lawyer on'

campus," said SGB member and
director of the legal services pro-
gram, Peter Petropoulos. “Students
don’t have the experience or the
money to deal effectively with their
own legal problems.”

The motivation behind the couSel-
ing service according_to Petropou-
los, is the board’s general concern
for student legal problems and the
inquiries of students experiencing
legal problems.

Two years ago, student govern-
ment developed a legal awareness
committee, but because ofthe assim-
ilation of incorrect information and
resulting law suits, the committee
was discontinued. Petropoulos is
more optimistic about this counsel-
ing attempt.

The service, according to Petro-
poulos, was initiated partially to
encourage student independence.

“This service will be a learning
experience for the student,” said
Petropoulos. “Usually when a stu-

dent has a legal problem, he can run
home to Daddy or Mommy. This
gives him the opportunity to expe-
rience the legal process."

Another concern is student reten-
tion rates. “Some students, when
they experience legal problems,”
said Petropoulous, “are forced to
drop out of school to pay the legal
fees. This will keep students in
school.” ..

Many other universities around
the country already offer legal servi-
ces to their students, and according
to Petropoulos, “Pitt is light years
behind other schools.”

The University of Colorado, for
example, staffs two full-time attor-
neys for student legal needs, and the
University of Minnesota staffs six.

These attorneys aid students in solv-
ing legal conflicts involving univer-
sity administration, traffic disputes,
landlord and tennant problems and
also with drafting legal documents.

According to Petropoulos, Craw-
ford’s counseling program contract
has already been approved by SGB
advisor Joyce Giangarlo and the Pitt
lawyers, and the success of the pro-
gram will now be determined by the
amount of support it receives from
students.

So far, only three Pitt students
have registered to participate in the
sessions but with a growing student
awareness, SGB is expecting enough
student participation to continue
and perhaps extend the program in
September.

Programbrings attention to deaf

By Jon WIllia'ms
The Pitt News

  

STUD :1

UDENT
NMENT GQVERNME

The silent world of the deaf and
the hearing impaired exploded into
music and laughter yesterday as
Deaf Awareness Day got into action
at the William Pitt Student Union.
Hearing impairment and deafness
afflict over 14 million Americans,
and trying to blend in can be a major
obstacle.

Bruce Nisberg, chairman of Deaf
Awareness Day, said, “We have to
get the hearing community and the
deaf community together so we can
be friends. People look at us as
though we are strange. We have to
make it easier for us to ﬁt in.” -

Nisberg contacted numerous

groups to come and give presenta-
tions to Pitt students on new tech-
nology for the deaf. These included
the Lions Club and Westinghouse,
who displayed machines available to
be used by the deaf to communicate
by phone. Also available were devi-
ces used to control light fixtures, so
that they would blink when there
were in-coming calls_._

James E. Eddy, in charge of the
Pittsburgh Deaf Theater, signed,
“We perform for the benefit of the
deaf community. We perform with-

‘out music, but do have translaters

for those who can hear but not sign.”
Karen Walkney, along with her
signing group Beautiful Hands,
signed the lyrics and danced to the
music of many songs, including the
new song “We are the Children."
Ken Meese, Irom television sta-
tion KDKA, was the emcee for the

day. He said that he had done public
interest stories on the deaf before
but had not had the chance to per-
form at such an event before.

Meese said he had met Walkney
before but hadn’t realized she was
deaf at first. He-since has learned
about Beautiful Hands and the cur-
rent program at Pitt. “It’s quite
interesting that Pitt now offers the
[sign] language as a foreign lan-
guage. It opens up a whole new-
world now for students.”

Most students interviewed said
they had taken sign because it
looked easy.

Christmas Murphy, a Pitt junior,
said, “I saw a poster for the Sign club
and it fit into my plans of special
education, so I just went to a meet-
ing. Then I started taking the
classes.“ Now a secondary English
education major, she has been sign-

ing for about two years.

Junior Mike Elliot, who is
involved with the YMCA’s “Camp
Get Together for Deaf Children,"
said, ‘“I just started taking the classes
with Karen [Walkney]. It's her pro-
gram and it’s interesting.”

“Besides,” Elliot continued, “it
comes in handy at the bars. You can
talk about the cute girl sitting next to
you and not have her know about
It.”

Representatives from Mt. Aloy-
sius Junior College were present
answering questions about their
two-year associate degree program.

Randy, one of the representatives,
said, “We are actively involved with
deaf students all day. We have ample
opportunity to relate and learn from
their problems.”

peace together, or live in peace by
leaving each other alone” —— both
could not reach agreement after a

Camp said later. “It's not a question
of whether he brushed my face or hit
me. He only offered to pay the court
costs [$26.50]. '

“He doesn’t even know what hap-

he was intoxicated and he even
admitted and said he was intoxi-
cated,” Camp said of Williams’ Feb.

sorry because he didn’t remember
what happened.”

Coach Foge Fazio has suspended

year, until fall practice begins in
August. Wiley, from Jeannette, Pa.,
is not expected to be disciplined by
Fazio as spring drills open today.

Davis of the BAS said in response to
the resolution yesterday. “I don’t
like being forced to defend someone
or repudiate someone.”

Davis said that the BAS is not in
the position to repudiate the state-
ments of any of their speakers and he
is not going to put the organization
in that position. “If they want an
emphatic no, they'll get one,” Davis
said.

Among other budgets that were
argued at the meeting included the
Hand-in-Hand budget, the Heinz
Chapel Choir budget and the Engi-

neering Student Cabinet budget.

The board voted to deny the
Hand-in-Hand Festival 3,000 bal-
loons for this year’s celebration.
Allocations chairman John Ben-
choff said, “We don’t think that
they’re a necessary or vital part of
the Hand--in-Hand Festival." Only
1,000 balloons will be funded by the
board.

The Heinz Chapel Choir was also
denied funding for their annual fall
camp. The Allocations Committee

justified the denial, saying that the

group could hold the event on cam-
pus to cut costs. Choir president Sue

Knechtl disagreed, arguing that
there is no place on campus to house
40 students for a weekend.

The funding of Skyscraper Engi-
neer Magazine, put out by the Engi-
neering Student Cabinet, will be
brought up again at next week’s
SGB meeting. The Allocations

«Committee recommended that the

board cease paying one-third of the
printing costs for the magazine.
Representatives from the ESC said
if SGB funding stopped, the maga-
zine would be in danger of
extinction.

A Common Pleas Court judge dismissed rape charges
against a man Wednesday because the 13-year-old girl he
allegedly assaulted was late for the trial.

Senior Common Pleas Judge J. Quint Salmon said he dis-
missed the jury after waiting 30 minutes for the girl, who was
the key witness in the case. The prosecuting attorney said the
judge waited only'l5 minutes before dropping charges against

the 28-year-old man.

According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the girl and her
mother were late for the trial because their bus was caught in
heavy Parkway East traffic. The prosecuting attorney said the

. two arrived at the courthouse five minutes before the judge said

he dismissed the jury.

Salmon described the attorney's account of the time as “plain
hogwash” and said it was the prosecutors’ “responsibility to

have their witnesses in court.”

This is the same judge who, in November 1983, acquitted a
man charged with molesting his four-year-old granddaughter.
Salmon said incest is a matter better handled by the family than

II o rvnuue-O

by a court.

These incidents indicate a reckless disregard for the rights of
the victim. Our system of justice has long looked to uphold the
rights of the accused, but in the process the rights of the victim

have been ignored.

The police sergeant in charge of the city’s sex assault division
said that Judge Salmon disregarded the seriousness of Wednes-

day's case.

“If it is such a serious case,” the Post-Gazette quoted Sal-
mon, “they should have their witnessses here on time.”

Regardless of the prosecution’s responsibility, certainly
there was some alternative to setting an accused rapist free.
There were 16 other witnesses ready to testify in the case,
according to police. Could he not have heard their testimony?
Is there no such word as “postpone” in the legal vocabulary?

It would seem that Judge Salmon is too involved with ‘his
own self-importance to recognize the “seriousness” of sexual

assault.

Certainly, a reprimand was in order for the prosecuting
attorney in this case. The courts are burdened with an overload
of cases and should not have to wait for witnesses to appear.

. Judge Salmon is well aware of this overload. He was brought
out of retirement in 1977 at the age of 70 because of a shortage

of judges in Allegheny County.

Perhaps in this instance the county can afford to be without a
judge. Seventy-eight is a good age for a second retirement.
Judge Salmon should be replaced by someone who under-
stands the gravity of sexual assault, especially when committed

against four- and l3-year-olds.

_L_etters to

Piano people

The Undergraduate Organization
of Music Majors wishes to reply on
behalf of the music department to
Alan Margolis’ letter published
March 18. Mr. Margolis sarcasti-
cally described the department’s
behavior as “stingy” because of cer-
tain policies regarding piano rental
and practice facilities. We will pro-
ceed to address and refute each of his
points.

Mr. Margolis, currently a law stu-
dent, has played the piano for 20
years, and has been accustomed to

‘using the practice pianos in the

Music Building once or twice a week
“to keep from getting rusty.” He
stated: “Recently, however, the
music department has decided to
restrict the use of its practice rooms
to music students only.” This is not a
recent policy. Music majors and
non-majors taking music classes pay
special fees: applied music fee, $150;
music major fee, $20; and a basic
piano fee of $30. Together, these fees
maintain the tuning and repair costs
of the practice pianos. Any person
who has not paid such fees does not
have the privilege of practice
facilities.

What Mr. Margolis has observed
“recently” is a crackdown on this
policy, since abuses regarding such
have been rampant.

Mr. Margolis also stated: “They
[the music department] have also
decided to change their policy on
renting pianos.” No such change has
been effected. What has changed is
the number of pianos available for
rental. In the past five years, three of
our rental pianos have been dam-
aged beyond repair, leaving only
two available. The law school
requested the use of one for a
Wednesday night rehearsal and a
Thursday night performance and
was refused, since the pianos were
needed for classes Thursday morn-
ing. Indeed, it is unfortunate that we
are unable to accommodate the law
school in this matter or the other
30,000 individuals on campus who
might at one time or another request
the use of the‘department’s pianos,
whetheér it be for practice or rental.

the Editor

What is even more unfortunate,
though, is that we are unable to
accommodate our own 99 applied
music students with sufficient prac-
tice rooms (-The Music Building has
10.) and pianos of adequate quality.

We demand that Mr. Margolis
withdraw the following statement:
“... Such selfishness on the part of
the music department is inexcusa-
ble.” Such sentiments should be
addressed not to the music depart-
ment, but to the provost, who is
responsible for cutbacks we have
received year after year.

World of illusion‘

In a recent letter to the editor
titled “Conservative Revolution,”
John Burkman Jr. tread on very thin
ice.

In pointing to the recent pheno-
mena of conservativism in Ameri-
ca’s young voters, he praises Mr.
Reagan for emancipating the young
from “a world of illusion — the

world of riots, drugs, meaningless.

liberal idealism and constant ten-
sion.” Mr. Burkman states, “Thanks
to President Reagan, we are truly a
new generation of Americans, one
that has in itself the power to begin
the world over again.”

I’m very confused! Don’t you
mean that we have the power to end
the world, that thanks to Mr. Rea-
gan we can destroy and re-destroy
the world dozens of times over? And
when you said “meaningless liberal
idealism,” ought I infer that the Civil
Rights Movement, anti-nuclear
demonstrations, peace rallies and
the anti-apartheid movement should
be dismissed as meaningless?

Just where do you stand? Are you
a fascist? Are you a racist or simply a
byproduct of the American propa-
ganda machines? Open your eyes,
Mr. Burkman, don’t believe every-
thing you read in U.S.A. Today?

How thankful I am that it is you
who lives in a world of illusion,
intoxicated in your egocentric fanta-

sies. Ah, but don‘t you fret, for your

situation is not hopeless. You see,
Mr. Burkman, there is this place
(and it is just about to open) where
you can go to be detoxed. It's called
“Nicaragua.” I’m really sorry I won’t
be joining you. While you’re really
busy with the Sandinistas in tropical

Nicaragua, I'll be stuck here, engag- 1

.ing myself in “meaningless liberal
idealism,” trying to get" you back
from your “holiday in the sun.”
Drugs are a lot less dangerous than
bullets, don’t you agree?

Final analysis

I suppose it was inevitable that
someone take advantage of this
ongoing dialogue on Louis Farrak-
han to crucify Israel by painting a
distorted picture of the Middle East
and Africa. Permit me the oppor-
tunity to correct the misinformation
of William J. Coury III.

First, on the question of Rabbi
Meir Kahane, there was indeed an
outcry in the Jewish community
when one synagogue (not many, as
Coury alleged) hosted him for an
evening talk. However, the debate
was carried on in the pages of local
Jewish papers and journals, not in
papers read by persons so misin-
formed about the Middle East as
Mr. Coury.

On South Africa, 111 have Mr.
Coury know that a very large per-
centage of the black African nations
carry on trade with South Africa.
Thus, the conducting of commerce
with that country out of economic
necessity (i.e., in order to survive)"
cannot be construed as condoning
her racist policies. Indeed, that

America trades with the Soviet.

Union does not represent an Ameri-
can embrace of Soviet communism.

On the Middle East, neither Israel
nor the U.S. owes anyone an apol-
ogy for Israel’s policies toward the
Shiites of southern Lebanon. Israel
upholds higher moral standards in
her handling of regional problems
(both in Lebanon and in “occupied
territories") than does any other
country in the world which has to
deal with international hotbeds of
similar proportions. Both Israel and
America have loudly expressed their
opposition to “the massacre of civil-
ians,” in words and in deeds. The
Lebanese Shiites, with whom Israel

has to deal on a daily basis, and most

of the other militias in Lebanon reg-
ularly conduct massacres of civilians
in a country where only Israel and
the U.S. even distinguish between
civilians and combatants. Addition-
ally, Mr. Coury would be very hard
pressed indeed to substantiate his
claim that Israel deliberately sub-
jects her own Arab population to
terrorism.

And finally, there is a very good
reason for America’s standing firmly
by Israel in the U.N. Security Coun-
cil. Mr. Coury is correct when
implying that Israel is not the only
pro-American state in the Middle
East. However, Israel is America's
only reliable ally there; Egypt has yet

to demonstrate reciprocity in her.

relations with the U.S. Moreover,
Israel represents a vital and indis-
pensable part of America’s ability to
defend western Europe, the Medi-
terranean and America’s Middle
East interests, including pro-
American Arab states. King Hussein
of Jordan knows this all too well, as
Israel saved Jordan from military
defeat at the hands of Syria or the
P.L.O. on at least two occasions.
In the ﬁnal analysis, Mr. Coury,
far from beinga danger to the U.S.,
Israel represents.the centerpiece of
America’s hope to stabilize the Mid-
dle East in the face of Soviet ambi-
t1ons and militant Shiite radicals.

UNlOUE_LY DESIGNED TOWN HOME CONDO



 

Before the Dawn/ Adam Eisenstat

The other day, just after
returning from my annual two-
week jaunt to Florida, I was pol-
ishing my new Trans Am and got
to thinking about William Ben-
nett, the man whom President
Reagan recently appointed edu-
cation secretary and conscience
of American higher education.

Bennett feels that the mate-
rially bloated middle class
should make greater sacriﬁces
for their children’s education and
possibly substitute lower-
echelon schools for the costly
“name" schools. He also said
that too many people go to col-
lege these days.

To promote good old Ameri-
can austerity and stay the course

« of social program ravishment,

the Reagan administration,
spearheaded by Bennett’s rheto-
ric, plans to make student loans
considerably harder to come by
and to lower the maximum
allowable yearly loan. Further-
more, Reagan and his minions
say this new student aid policy is
needed to curb abuses among the
well-heeled, who it is said some-

5 times bank unneeded loans and

i then collect the interest.

When I heard that, I breathed
a sigh of relief, feeling myselffor-
tunate enough to-have avoided
this impending student loan ax,
having already enjoyed four lav-
ish years of endlessly flowing
Peruvian flake, courtesy of the
government’s largesse. I also got
a liberal arts degree.

When one compares Bennett’s
views on the need to curtail stu-
dent aid with his grave assess-
ments of higher education’s
egregious failure to provide all
students with an adequate
humanities education (which he
says is the crucial means of pass-
ing and preserving the ﬂame of
“Western civilization”), one
senses an obvious contradiction.
This former philosophy profes-
sor and Harvard ‘law school
graduate said that he would
theoretically give his son $50,000
intended for a Harvard educa-
tion if he wanted to start a busi-
ness instead of blowing four
years of his life wallowing in the
flotsam of Western civilization.
The man has obviously been
severely perverted by neo-right-

wing anti-intellectualism and
free-enterprise obsession. This
man intends to choke your access
to student loans while his son
opens a driving range instead of
studying Dante.

What of Western civilization?
Will all the bound culture of

three millenia of slaughter, life ,

and literary fodder simply collect
dust and fade into the obscure
domains of academia, where we
mere mortals dare not tread?
I have news for William Ben-
nett' and all of those self-styled
highbrows who cannot get
through the day without a shot of
Vivaldi or Goethe: Western cul-
ture has been slowly but surely
eroding since the inception of sit-
com. If you don't believe me,
stand on a street corner and take
a random poll of people in the
15-30 age group and you’ll find
that they know every word to
“Gilligan's Island” and “Brady
Bunch” theme songs before they
know who ‘Rabelais or Cervantes
15.
Most detrimental to Western
culture is the trade school men-
tality of practically everyone

involved in the higher education
process, from Reaganites who
chant “more science and math”
like some Ruskie-cleansing man-
tra to students and administra-
tors. What a dilemma this is. One

has to work, right? One has to,

earn enough to own a VCR, a car
with cruise control and a self-
cleaning microwave, right?

Colleges keep the ever-
upscaled consumer economy
intact. This is an inexorable fact
that threatens to topple the pan-
theon of western culture, where
all of history's great impractical-
ists dwell. But just remember:
Culture is consciousness, money
is green.

What are we, the residents of
the best city in the greatest coun-
try, to do? Why, build a compu-
ter center, of course. Weave
more strands into the red silicon-
chip carpet that runs through
this breeding ground of suppli-
cants to the altar of (try to
remember the last time you've
heard this phrase) high tech.
Well, I guess it’s all in the service

-of a good cause. Ignorance is

strength.

and teaching assistants will
decrease. “Presently, there are
roughly 30 facutly members. This
will decrease as our pharmacology
section is phased out. When the sec-
tion moves, so will some of the
faculty,” Bergman said.

“The decrease in teaching assis-
tants from 23 to 13 is also a reflec-
tion of the transferring of
pharmacology. But we will maintain
enough TAs.”

The fifth change is a proposal to
phase out the Ph.D. program. “It is
still up in the air. We understand the
moving of pharmacology. But those
programs that are unique to phar-
macy we would liketo maintain.
Therefore, we hope to offer a Ph.D.
in pharmaceutical science that will
be of high quality and ‘cost-effective
since this degree is unique to the
School of Pharmacy. We really feel
that this is an important depart-
ment,” Bergman said.

The Pitt News, Friday, March 22, 1985

Pharmacy saved

The final change is that the
school’s income will meet its direct
costs. When the preliminary recom-
mendations came out in November,
the school’s cost was exceeding its
revenues by $900,000.

As stated before, this is one of the
reasons for an increase in tuition.
But Bergman does not feel that the
increase will affect the school. Berg-
man pointed out that even with an
increase, the university will still be
cost-comparitive in Pennsylvania.

Presently, there are four colleges
in the state which offer degrees in
pharmaceutical science. Two are
private and the tuition is considera-
bly higher.
roughly $3,800, according to Berg-
man, whereas Pitt is roughly $3,300.
So even with the anticipated
increase, Pitt may still be the best
school to attend in terms of cost.

Another change that the univer-
sity is exploring is the possibility of
merging the School of Pharmacy,

Temple ’s tuition is.

the School of Nursing and the
School of Health Related Profes-
sions into a “College of Health
Sciences.”

The university feels a merger
would be beneficial for a couple of
reasons. One is that “common
instructional needs in the under-
graduate programs” of the three
schools could be met by the merger,
according to the ﬁnal recommenda-
tions of the Five-year Plan.

The other reason is that the space
currently being utilized could be
redistributed to save money. A reno-
vation of Salk Hall has been
planned, and the proposed “College
of Health Sciences” could be housed
there.

Bergman is pleased with this idea
and said: “The door is wide open for
discussion to look at the merger. We
think it is a very good concept.”

Overall, Bergman noted that the
school is pleased with the ﬁnal
recommendations.

Sans Soleil.']0umey to the end of time

by Michael Selz_

Many times, some of our richest

and most memorable cultural expe- ‘

riences happen to us by accident.
.Maybe you left the TV tuned in to
WQED too long and got engrossed.
Or you finally consented to going to
"the opera with your father and ended
up liking it. Suffice it to say that it
happens.

Well, here is a challenge for you.
I'm asking you to consider viewing a
film this weekend that is offbeat,
independently produced, low-budget
and non—narrative — at least not in
the usual sense.

Sans Soleil is a 1982 film by veteran
filmmaker Chris Marker. On the vis-
ual level, it is a stunning travelogue
taking you‘ to Tokyo, Africa, Iceland
and San Francisco. Commenting on
its images and sometimes veering off
into mini-dissertations on other sub-
jects is a cameraman -— or rather, a
woman reading the letters of the
cameraman. He is a philosopher,
observer, storyteller and hapless
wanderer. His comments are pene-
trating revelations on the past, pres-
ent and future of the people in his
film — but the comments are not
even limited to people. Cats, volca-
nos, talking JFK mannequins -
nothing escapes his compassion or his
awarding of significance.

bounty hunter.”

This interest in banality, however,
is not some jaded intellectual con-
struct. It is a willingness and a will to
see the soul in everything. If his
camera seems to be focused indis-
criminately on many individuals, the
pathos and the affection he feels for
them is foremost. He has an Altman-
like fascination with ordinary people
and ritual.

At its beginning, the film is framed
with an image of Icelandic children
playing on a hillside; at the end, this
same hillside and the village below
are shown four years later, covered
by the ash of a volcanic eruption.

Much of the film takes us to street
festivals and holy days in Tokyo and
Guinea-Bissau, non-Western socie-
ties grappling with the ‘peculiar colli-
sion of the future with the past. In
Tokyo, women come out on their
20th birthdays in traditional kimonos
topped with feather boas, go to
seminars on adult womanhood, get a
grab bag of goodies from the city
government and are allowed to
phone home free from anywhere in
the country.

We see a darker westernization in
Guinea—Bissau. In a military awards
ceremony that is nearly a parody of
the pomp of its antecedent, in the
West, a president honors _a soldier
who, we are told, will overthrow, jail
and exile him several years later.

The film has one recurring spring-
board in the concepts of memory and
history. At one point, the cameraman
says that both are impossible, that
they are just a random collection of
retained images. Though it's obvious
that his view is bizarre and utterly his
own, there is a unity to the film that
makes it feel true. He makes you trust
him and give yourself over to his
musings. It is a credit to his ability
that word and image blend so
convincingly.

He fantasizes that in the year 4001
we will have total recall, and memory

Embracing life in all its

by Susan D. Stringfellow

Mask begins with a slow pan of a
bedroom, taking inventory —— posters
of Bruce Springsteen, the Beatles and
a Harley-Davidson motorcycle; on
another wall, an altar to the 1959
Dodgers consisting of baseball cards
affixed to a playing field with a map of
Europe next to it. The camera comes
to rest on the back of someone red-
headed, primping in front of the mir-
ror. Then he turns. We see his face.

Rocky Dennis has a disfiguring dis-
ease that accelerates the depositing of
calcium around his skull. The bridge
of his nose is all but gone. His head is
nearly twice its normal size. It makes
people think he is wearing a mask.

This film is about the kind of hero-
ism that can come from having to live
on the outside. Deprived of the nor-
mal socialization process, a person
can grow up faster, perhaps even bet-
ter. Rocky is not allowed the luxury
of the special schools — the insulated,
sympathetic world of therapists and
hospitals. His mother, Rusty, won't
allow it.

Rusty Dennis is unmarried, rides

. with a motorcycle gang and has drug

problems. Her own status as an out-
cast provides fertile soil for her
deformed son to grow up in. To the
world outside, the gang members
look pretty frightening themselves.
Rusty and the extended family of the
motorcycle gang know and love

Rocky for the person inside. This is

perhaps the only environment he
could have grown up in without the
trauma normally attendant to his
condition. »

As Rocky's troubled mother, Cher
continues to prove her viability as a
serious dramatic actress. Her charac-
ter remains strong while faced with
the inevitable demands of a severely
deformed child. This is not to say that
her son is completely dependent on
her. In actuality, Rocky is her stabiliz-
ing force, a shoulder for her to cry on.
This makes for a unique bond thatis
as much mother—son as it is father-
daughter. In perhaps the most mov-
ing scene of the film, Cher, scrambled
on a mixture of cocaine and barbitu-
rates, sits at the dining room table,
frantically trying to write a letter to
her son who is working as a counsel-
or's aid at a camp for the blind. The
breakdown that we witness is so
believable that you feel yourself
crumpling with her.

This could very easily degenerate
to a thin allegory of Christ Child and
Mary Magdalene except for the real-
ism of the screenplay. It is the first

V screenplay by Anna Hamilton Phe-

lan, who met Rocky a short time
before his death in 1980 and tracked
down his mother two years later to
write the story.

Though the script paints him as a
beautiful person, he is not saccharin-
sweet. He sells his tutoring services

to classmates. He tears into a friend

who reneges on a cycling trip planned
for Europe. He's not an angel. But
then there's the hooker his mom
hires for him. He teaches her all night
to think of good memories. He tames
cynicism and superficiality.

Even while watching thefilm, you
will grow to see beneath surfaces. At
first it's hard to look at him. By the

‘end, you're able to see through the

deformity and like yourself better for
it. You will fall in love with this char-

will be obsolete. Images, the constitu-
ents of memory, will presumably be
thrown off, too. He shows that
images are as mutable as memory.
Using a video synthesizer (which he
also shows us with all its knobs, plugs
and flow diagrams), he periodically
deconstructs his film, turning it into
seething high-contrast composites of
light and dark, calling it "the zone," a
world without time. Other times,
he'll zoom in so close as to turn nor-
mal body movements into abstract,
objectified blurs of color.

Both memory and his-
tory are impossible 
they are just a random
collection of retained
images.  

It is impossible in one viewing to
grapple with everything in this film. I
haven't mentioned the Vatican relics
in the Tokyo department store, the
death of the giraffe, the monkey
clutching his groin or the oldest
mobster in Tokyo teaching goodness
to children on TV. I haven't even
mentioned the pilgrimage to San
Francisco for Hitchcock's Vertigo, or
that in the future, poetry will be
made by everyone and emus will be in
"the zone." See Sans Soleil and
acquaint yourself with a man who
loves the world as much as he is
weary of it.

Stoltz under four pounds of makeup.

Mask is filmed with a restrained
realism, using color rather than the
more agreeable black and white of the
somewhat similar film, Elephant Man.
It is an emotional movie, but the act-
ing and the screenplay give it an
integrity that makes it rise above the
run-of-the-mill heartstring pullers.
This film will make you feel good

‘Showcase, Friday, March 22, 1985

By Leslie M. Bennett

What can be said about a young
God-fearing nun who becomes preg-
nant and is then accused of murder-
ing her baby by wrapping the
umbilical cord around its neck and
leaving it in a wastebasket? It's a
squeamishly controversial subject on
many levels, and although John Pie]-
meier has quite a lot to say about it in
his play Agnes of God, even he seems
squeamish about delivering a conclu-

asion. The current production at the

Pittsburgh Playhouse pours out

moral and religious questions con- -

cerning the nature of faith and strug-
gles with scientific and spiritual
answers, yet it never reaches any
decisions —— only an outcome. The
last line ends, quite literally, with a
question mark.

Agnes’ chilling story, which appar-
ently is founded _in fact, is told by
Doctor Martha Livingstone,’ a psychi-

.atrist who has been appointed to

determine whether Agnes should
stand trial for murder. Having no
recollection of the baby's conception,
birth or death, Agnes has achild-like
faith and an extreme naivete which
challenge Dr. Livingstone’s rigor-
ously clinical curiosity as well as her
religious convictions. It seems she

Pam Shafer star in Agnes of God.

has a grudge against Catholicism that
goes back to her childhood. Diagnos-
ing and treating Agnes forces her to

consider her faith once again —— as in a V

”patient heals doctor” scenario.

Through the doctored, relentless
badgering, we learn that Agnes had
no father, that her mother was an
alcoholic, that she was kept indoors
until the age of 17, and that her
mother molested her.

At the other end of the melodra-
matic scale, there is a worldly wise
Mother Superior who is as bound and

 

ol Wit, ary  and

determined to protect Agnes as Dr.
Livingstone is to save her. Both
undoubtedly mean well, but each is
looking for different answers —-— the
difference between what is logical
and what is spiritual. The Mother
Superior’s motivations are a bit more
complicated, however, and suspi-
cious. Not only does she want to
believe that Agnes’ pregnancy hap-
pened through a miraculous act of
God, but midway into the play, she
blurts out that she is actually Agnes’
aunt. Talk about melodrama!

The story is unquestionably a stir-
ring reaffirmation in the power of
faith. Agnes’ agonizing question is:
”How can I be a mistake if I'm really
here? God doesn't make mistakes.”
But somehow . the emotions are
derived in a cheap way. There are
certain unexplained phenomena: the
palms of Agnes’ hands bleed for no
apparent reason, and Dr. Livingstone
begins menstruating after her_child-
bearing years have long since passed.

The author clearly knows how to
digress into amusing tales of
cigarette addiction and grade-school
nicknames. And he also knows how
to write fiery scenes. The disappoint-
ment is that he creates these crucial
scenes with Agnes entering into a
contrived hypnosis. It's as though he
can't think of any other way to get
out what the audience is waiting for.

page 11

 

A lot is left up to the three actresses
to bring real life to this play, and,
fortunately, they do an admirable job,
as does director Raymond Laine.
Mary K. Chess, as Agnes, gives a
steady performance of a difficult role.
Her childish voice and wide eyes
become wild in an instant with dis-
turbed fear. In one shocking scene,
she is called to re-enact the night of
giving birth under hypnosis, which
positively sends shudders through
the audience. Jocelyn Withim is most
convincing as the Mother Superior,
revealing capability for softness as
easily as for outbursts of cursings.
Pam Shafer carries the play from
beginning to end with her role of Dr.
Livingstone. Her soliloquies are de-
livered rather quickly, but she's a
smooth talker and actress.

There's a strange film-noir effect
to this production. The stage is stark,
set only with two chairs and a stand-
ing ashtray. Painted shadows are cast
on the floor from three gothic arched
windows, and heavy smoke filters the
air constantly because of the doctor's
obsession with cigarettes.

After the ”final reel” of Agnes’
story is run, Doctor Livingstone
turns to us once more to tell us -
teary eyed — that she hopes to have
gained something, some small part of
Agnes from the whole ordeal.

She should, because it's doubtful
anyone else does.

CHESS .
Andersson, Rice and Ulvaeus

RCA

Experiencing a stage musical
without its accompanying sets,
costumes and spoken dialogue is
much like trying to appreciate
]aws without seeing the fish.
Keeping straight the complex
storyline of Chess after an initial
spin of the double-lp set is an
equally formidable challenge.

Borne of the collective talents
of multi-media entrepreneur
Tim Rice and former ABBA
songsmiths Benny Andersson
and Bjorn Ulvaeus, Chess offers
an intriguing plot that focuses
on the political mind-gaming
and commercial exploitation of
the World Chess Championship
to be held amidst the snow-
white Tirolian splendor of the
mythical town of Merano. From
the first note, the music cap-
tures the airy atmosphere of the
Alps with billowy strings and
festive choral arrangements. It
is instantly noticeable, how-
ever, that Chess sports no mind-
blowing overture —— nothing
resembling the bombastic intro
to ]esus Christ Superstar or the
haunting opening number of

BEATHOTEL
The Baagaa
RCA

Maybe something’s been lost
in the translation. The unpleas-
ant alternative, however, is that
the Bongos have gone for the
big bucks. Aftermany success-
ful independent singles and last
year's widely acclaimed major-
label debut with the ep Numbers’
With Wings, the Bongos have
stiffed over the course of their
first full-length lp.

With singer/songwriter/lead
guitarist Richard Barone out
front, the Bongos can be any-
thing from a guitar attack rock

_ band to slick dance floor aficio-

nados or, at their lowest point,
a pop version of milktoast.

The sad tale of Beat Hotel is too
much milktoast and not enough
good hooks. ”Space Jungle”
launches the disk with key-
boards enhancing the guitars
that drive the song, hinting at
the boppy enthusiasm that has
come to be a Bongo trademark.
However, after ”_Apache Danc-
ing,” which follows, enthusiasm
is far less evident than musical
and lyrical posturing, which
fouls things up with irritating
frequency.

Since the Bongos don't really
have anything to say in their
songs, their music has got to grab
you. Unfortunately, this is
rarely the case on Beat Hotel.
After the first two cuts‘ on the
record, there are only one or
two others that amount to any-
thing more than muzak for the
'80s.

At one time a promising pop
band, the Bongos may have cut

Evita, Rice's major claims to
fame — just an introduction
that reflects the town's pleas-
antness and bubbling anticipa-
tion of a major ”sporting” event.
As‘ interesting as such a sce-
nario may be, before long the
story is stricken with a nagging
case of genre plague — a love
tryst that keeps smacking the
audience in the forehead as a
continual reminder that this is
indeed a musical. The love affair
seems so contrived and silly, but
without such muddled love tri-
angles, where would all of the
great love songs come from?
The principal females — not
to mention love rivals — in
Chess, Florence (played by Elaine
Paige) and Svetlana (Barbara
Dickson), sing their way
through heartache by way of
the record's loveliest tune, ”I
Know Him So Well.” The song
showcases the effortless and
melodic songwriting of the
ABBA vets coupled with sweet,
stage—perfect vocal performan-
ces. Along with the bitterly
angry ”Nobody’s on Nobody's
Side,” "1, Know Him So Well” is
easily one of the show’s most
memorable numbers. But Mur-
ray Head's performance of”Pity

 

Korberg, Ulvaeus, Andersson, Rice an"d"Paige of Chess _

the Child," the headstrong
American’s emotional state-
ment of self-pity and anger,
marks the show’s highest
ground, emphasizing the fact
that the music of Chess provides
effective backdrops for its char-
acters. For instance, when we
first meet The American, he is
introduced in a squall of electric
guitar thatdisplays all of the
vulgarity and self-indulgence of
his personality, just as The Rus-
sian (portrayed by Swedish
vocalist Tommy Korberg) deliv-
ers his vocal performance
backed by hints of Russian folk
music.

The-biggest problem faced by
Chess is, at the same time, its sav-
ior. The quality of the music is

unbelievably consistent. No
portion of this musical is partic-
ularly outstanding, nor is any
part disastrous. Without the
ridiculously complicated love
story that strangles the energy
out of the second half of the
project, the full-scale expe-
rience of Chess onstage could be
more enjoyable. As is pointed
out by the authors in the
album's liner notes, Chess is still
a ”work in progress." If properly
redressed, America may once
again import one of Broadway's
biggest spectacles. If not, bombs
away, fellows.

SECRET SECRETS
Joan Armatrading
A&M Records

Joan Armatrading is alone in
the world of female pop vocal-
ists on the basis of a drastic style
shift. A veteran of the ”sensitive
’70s,” she emerged into a
crowded field of female folk-
jazz stylists. Of that group, only
a few have kept from drifting
into obscurity. Joni Mitchell has
released only one album since
1980, retreating only somewhat
from her headlong plunge into
jazz and maintaining her
audience by limiting (and so
making more precious) her out-
put. Ricki Lee Jones has done
likewise, sticking to slick studio
fusion for her accompaniment.

E Linda Rohdstadi has shovedher ‘L ’

muse back to the 1940s, manag-
ing to remain timely by opting
instead for timelessness. Only
Joan Armatrading has made the
bold swing away from the eter-
nally safe cool of pop jazz. At the
substantial risk of alienating her
”mellower” fans, she's become a
rock ’n’ roller.

The sheer power of new wave
producer Steven Lillywhite
made his collaboration with
Joan Armatrading a venture
that was only sporadically suc-
cessful — sometimes pushing
her to new heights, sometimes
drowning her out. Though the
arrangements were bigger and
more -' amplified, the material
was sometimes too dynamic and
intricate to sustain them. After
several records with him, she
has turned to a new producer.

This new record, though,
produced by Mike Howlett,
evinces the quiet assertion of
having finally mastered a new
format. Shifting gears easily
from techno-rock. to salsa to
piano balladry (helped out on
ivories by Joe Jackson), Ms.
Armatrading covers a lot of
ground without ever blowing it.

The opener, ”Persona Grata,”
is eclectic and restless — the

. whole record can be heard in

microcosm. It starts slowly,
almost meditatively, with tim-
pani, acoustic guitar and syn-
thesized strings. Then the
electric guitar tears into it, the
lyrics turn frustrated and insis-
tent, a thumb-slapped bass puts
some sex into the stew, and a
saxophone pushes everything
aside for a blistering solo.

The rest of the record cavorts
through a territory char-ted on
the first song — adding, sub-
tracting. Theﬂsingle, a minor-

’ {key-“ anthem" called’ "Témpm§-"

tion,’ explores the fear of letting
go/the fear of being so possessed all the
time. ”Talking to the Wall”
blends Joe Jackson's piano, a
glistening flugelhorn solo and a
salsa horn chart with lyrics: You
see right through me, rust, cracks,
warts and all. ”Love by You” finds
Joan with no accompaniment
save Joe Jackson's piano and has
the tender, painful honesty that
she built her career on.) E
It is to Mike Howlett’s credit
that so big a sound doesn't crush
the human immediacy of this
lady. If you haven't bought a
Joan Armatrading album since

this one up. There just are_n’t
many good writers out there
anymore. She's one —— lyrically
and musically.

THE RAMONES
Syria Mosque
March 20,‘ 1985

, By Michael Fay

Yes, 11 years and eight albums
later, the Ramones are still at it, and
better yet they've still got it. This was
clear last Wednesday night at the
Syria Mosque as they played an hour
and 10 minutes of driving, exciting
and undeniably danceable pop music.
They worked hard onstage, cranking
out an amazing 31—song set.

Although the band claims not to
have rehearsed seriously in years,
their live sound is still tight and their
timing impeccable.

Beginning with Dee Dee's tradi-
tional ”1-2-3-4" battle cry, the
Ramones launched into a set which
brought new life to their earlier,
underproduced material, such as

”Bli.tzkrieg Bop” and ”Commando",

added an extra charge to overpro-
duced songs like ”Rock’n’Roll Radio”

. and gave fans a good healthy dose of

new material from their latest album
Too Tough to Die. ‘

 

Although six songs off the new
record were performed, the first
three albums — Ramones, Leave Home
and Rocket to Russia — dominated the
evening. They played seven songs off
the first album alone, including the
first song they composed in a base-
ment somewhere in Forrest Hills,
N.Y. ”I Don't Wanna Walk Around
With You.”

The band really seemed to have
their collective ‘ heart deeply
embedded in this earlier material.
This was most obvious with Johnny,
whose face lit up as they took off into
a Rocket to Russia medley, which

included ”Rockaway Beach,” ”Surfin’

Bird” and a heartwarming rendition
of the ”Cretin I-lop.”]oey also seemed

to enjoy this part of the show, taking '

artistic license and crooning.

The crowd, an extremely varied
lot, seemed to enjoy this sentimental
journey back to the days of glue snif-
fing, brat beating and frontal loboto—
mys. They responded with the
familiar ”Hey Ho Let's Go” chant

[during breaks in the action and

cheered the pinhead as he came
onstage to declare yet another vic-

tory for the Ramones over the forces
of evil. He handed his placard to Joey,
which was emblazoned, as always,
with the slogan "Gabba Gabba Hey.”
The phrase, which appears in the
song ”Pinhead," was derived from the
movie Freaks and has since become as
much a symbol of the Ramones as
their presidential seal and their black
leather jackets.

Symbols and slogans have always
been a part of the Ramones appeal.
They have attracted a loyal cult fol-
lowing which has transformed the
Ramones into somewhat of a rock’n-
’roll institution. This fact has driven
critics to ask the all too crucial ques-
tion: Have the Ramones crossed the

  MARCH /APRIL FILMS

fine line that separates a legend from

_a parody?

The simple reason the Ramones

haven't become a parody is the same"
reason critics didn't laugh at John

Fogerty this year when he released
”some_ of the same old stuff,” What
Fogerty does and what the Ramones
do is rock/pop music with no frills,
pretentions or excuses. A show as
intense and fun-loving as the
Ramones’ concert can't be cfaked,

As of now, the band that helped
inspire the punk explosion of the late
'70s has gone on to compete with yet
another of its offspring: hardcore.
And competition, as any free market
economist will tell you, promotes
excellence.

Tennis team at 4-5

but tough part is over

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

After a seemingly successful start,
the Pitt tennis squad has lost some of
its early-season ﬂare. The team fin-
ished its -first roadtrip two weeks
ago, returning to Pittsburgh after a
3-2 record against ﬁve Tennessee
schools.

The Panthers have somewhat
slowed down since then, accumulat-
ing losses against Bucknell, Blooms-
burg and Penn State this past week.
Pitt’s record now stands at 4-5.

The skid began last Saturday
afternoon when the squad traveled
to Bucknell University to face the
strong Bisons. Pitt lost a squeaker to
Bucknell last season at Trees Courts
in a match that could have gone
either way. Head coach George
Dieffenbach felt that this match

would be just as close, and indeed it
was, as the Panthers dropped a 5-4
decision.

“We knew what to expect from
them beforehand,” Dieffenbach said

‘ after the match. “Whoever would

win the match would do it by a 5-4
score. Unfortunately for us, it hap-
pened to be them.”

As’ Dieffenbach predicted at the
start of the season, Pitt’s doubles
teams would make the difference in
deciding many of their matches. The
loss to Bucknell was a perfect exam-
ple with the Panthers losing two of
their three doubles matches after
splitting the singles at three apiece.
The one doubles victory was the
third-seeded duo of freshman Greg
Campbell and sophomore Rich
Monteleone.

One slight hindrance to the Pitt
effort at Bucknell was a ﬂu virus that
both Dave Johnson and Jack Kalla
had. Both played fine tennis in their

The Pitt baseball team traveled to Florida
and returned with three losses but the
Panthers also gained something.

Spring football gets underway

By Mark A. Slndler
The Pitt News

The umpteenth annual spring
football drills officially cast their
first shadows upon Pitt Stadium
today at 4 p.m.

Reading from a very annotated
proclamation announcing as much,
Coach Foge Fazio set the register

straight. A “packed house," cracked

one pompous observer, of media fig-
ures listened (intently or snoozily) to
his fourth State of the Gridmen in as
many years.

New priorities: “A tough, aggres-
sive attitude,” leaving to chance last
year’s team pathos.

Roster changes: Certain talent
can be better utilized at new posi-
tions, forcing observers to assume

that some players needlessly
expended kinetic energy.
Position assessment: The one- '

year absence of Craig “Ironhead”

Ah, but all is well. Ft. Lauderdale’s

“walking on water yet.

All around, not a bad day on the
Oakland football big board on the
rebound of a 3-7-1 depression. Clint
Wilson is especially pleased. His
stock options were supposed to

expire at last season’s close. Regret- _

tably, he never reached last season.

On the now well-documented
Black Thursday, the redoubtable
tight end cleanly broke his left foot
in the first week of fall camp.
Resigned thereafter to the sidelines,
he received an official September
redshirt.

“It bothers you, but there’s
nothing you can do about it,” Wil-
son said yesterday. “I dealt with it
well. The problem was after awhile
you know you can’t play. I got into
the books, took it off my mind a
little."

Wilson, a 6-3, 230-lb. roadrunner,
has started ever since replacing an
injury-riddled John Brown in 1982.
His 12-for-l02 yards performance
that year preceded 21 receptions for
2_l6 yards and two touchdowns in
’83.

Measly numbers, maybe, but
impressive when compared with the
rottenness of last year. Four differ-

Why Be A
Do-Cooder?

Quakers are chronic do~
gooders. The government
adopted our scheme for prison
education 100 years after it was
started as Quaker volunteer
work. There was a Quaker
plan for state endowed medi-
cine ZSO years before Medicare.
Quakers worked to abolish
slavery 175 years before Aboli~
tion. And the checker—board
pattern of American cities was
originally based on Quaker
town planning, on the principle
of equal shares of daylight for
all.

What started all this?

William Penn said, "True God—
liness does not turn men out of
the world, but enables them to
live better in it, and excites
their endeavor to mend it."
Friends are not apologetic
about being do—gooders. They
don't feel that they have to
”justify" helping others in need,
working for a just and fair soci~
ety, or endeavoring to ‘bring
about peace in the world. "Do-
gooding" is serving that of God
in every human. It is a way of

life.

Do you, too, suspect that doing
good is not so bad? If so, per-
haps the beliefs of the Friends
will be useful to you. We have

“After the season progressed, it
seemed they were no longer part of
the offense,” Wilson said kindly.

The intrinsic worth of Clint Wil-
son bears even more signiﬁcance for
the Panthers’: offensive fortunes in
’85. Already lost are split ends Bill
Wallace and Jeff Casper. Their pos-
sible replacements, Dwayne Milloy
and Mark Stanton, are legitimate
unknowns.

Junior Chuck Scales is still set-
tling out after an abrupt move from
tailback to ﬂanker last year. His
theoretical competition, Matt Sten-
nett, is_ currently in Tallahassee,
beginning his second season with
Bobby Lewis’ boys of spring.

At Pitt, where tight ends generally
receive the acclaim accorded water-
boys, Wilson is trendbuster

“I would like to feel Johnny Con-
gemi will come to use me in any
situation, [that he will have] the con-
fidence that I can do the job," said
Wilson, who played only two years
at Pahokee (Fla.) High School.

“There are a lot of new things we
have to learn. It’s all a new chal-
lenge. This is what spring football is
all about. Whatever they give us, we
have to apply it to any situation."

son’s forehead for some reason every

Panther notes as spring drills begin
today:

0 Recent back surgery on free
safety Teryl Austin, a bum knee for
sophomore halfback Billy Owens
and the injured foot of freshman
tackle Torn Ricketts will all preclude
their participation for the next five
weeks.

0 Coach Foge Fazio has moved
defensive tackle Chuck Williams to
offense after the junior from Free-
dom had undergone two knee
operations.

“He might be a step or two slow,’
Fazio said, “but it's tough for him to.
be in that spot [defensive line], the
day-to-day pounding.”

Williams has been wearing heavy
braces ever since his freshman
redshirt.

0 Fazio, on junior flanker Matt
Stennett playing baseball and miss-
ing a majority of spring drills: “Matt
and I had a nice, long talk. Right
now, unfortunately, he’s down
south. I-Ie’ll still come [to Pitt Sta-
dium] when he has time off. How

9

Spring football gets underway

much, again, depends on his base-
ball schedule.” '

0 With the loss of Bill Fralic,
Fazio quipped, “We petitioned the
NCAA to see if we can put two guys
[at offensive tackle]. He’s so dog-
gone big.”

0 Fazio said he likely would have
moved suspended tailback Craig
“Ironhead” Heyward to fullback
had he been allowed to play this
year. The incumbents there are
senior Darnell Stone and Tom
Brown.

0 Joe Felitsky, the Central
Catholic transfer from Notre Dame,
fired at will and accurately while on
the scout team last year but is guar-
anteed nothing except his three-year
scholarship.

“He’s done everything we've
asked him to,” Fazio said of the 6-3
sophomore quarterback. “You have
to keep in mind that he’s not been
playing football for two-and-a-half
years. He‘s like a rookie quarterback
coming in with the rest ofthem. He’s
an unknown quality to us. He has to
show us what he can do.”

0 Chris Jelic, part-time quarter-
back and full-time punter last year
and now first-string catcher for
Bobby Lewis’ baseball team,
recently admitted that he will only
punt this season.

Last year, his first as a Panther
with Lewis, Jelic started in right
field.

The

Tennis team at 4-5

continuedfrom page ﬁfteen
singles matches but were visibly
worn down by the time the doubles
competition came.

“Both Dave and Jack played solid
tennis early on in singles,” agreed
Dieffenbach. “It was evident, how-
ever, that they both lost some steam
once the doubles started."

The Panthers met on Sunday to
play an away match against a some-
what surprising Lycoming team.
Pitt took the match by a 9-0 count,
their lone success in the four-day
stretch. Although Pitt was unques-
tionably the stronger squad and
was predicted to win, Lycoming
fought a tough battle in most of the
individual sets.

Pitt won all three doubles matches
easily. However, the No. 1, No. 3
and No. 5 singles were not so one-
sided as Johnson and Campbell
were stretched to three sets apiece
and Monteleone needed seven
games in each set to win his match
7-6, 7-5.

“They [Lycoming] were no
pushovers,” said Dieffenbach.
“Their No. 1 singles player, Jim

at

Shawber, played a very
match.”

Then the roof caved in.

The squad‘s matches on the road
against Bloomsburg and Penn State
were close, but not close enough as
the Panther team lost by identical
9-0 final scores.

These results are not indicative of
Pitt’s play, however, considering the
quality of the Bloomsburg and the
Nittany Lion squads. This year’s
Bloomsburg squad is ranked in the
Top 10 for Middle States schools
with singles players Tim Mitchell
and Mike Casari being some of the
finest around.

Likewise, Penn State was
extremely competitive, although
Dieffenbach singled out the singles
play of Jack Kalla and Chuck De-
Vera as being expectional for Pitt, as
was the No. 2 doubles team ofJohn—
son and sophomore Jeff Dadowski.

tough

The Panthers will play their next
two matches at home. Sunday after-
noon at 1 p.m. will involve the Big
Indians of Indiana University,.and
next Friday they will play Bethany.

Baseball talks

NEW YORK (UPI) — Talks
aimed at reaching a new basic
labor agreement between the
players association and major
league baseball owners resumed
today in Florida, and the key
: pitch came from the owners.

Management is proposing that
baseball switch from a five- to
seven- game league champion-
ship series. The proposed change
would take effect this season.

The players association, how-
ever, is not sure it will accept the
idea under their current financial
set up, but it admits it might
agree to the change on a one-year
trial basis.

Citing the industry’s poor
ﬁnancial picture, the owner’s
representative wants a seven
game series in order to bring in
an additional million in televi-
sion revenue. The players are
asking that one-third of that
amount go to its pension fund,
but the owners want to pocket
the whole bankroll.

The two sides will take up the
issue again beginning next Tues-
day in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Savard speaks

MONTREAL (UPI) — Cana-
diens general manager Serge
Savard is saying today that last
year he and Guy Lafleur dis-
cussed the possibility of a trade
involving the one-time All-Star.

Savard claims that Lafleur

Sports Briefs

initiated the talks because the
NHL veteran was depressed
about his play with the Cana-
diens. But Savard emphasizes
that the approach to the situa-
tion was, as Savard said, “one of
friends, not general manager-
player.”

Lafleur retired last November
after 13 seasons with the Cana-
diens. During that span he
scored 518 goals and had 723
assists, but his production trailed
off sharply during the last three
seasons.

former world heavyweight
champion —— now 41 — will fight

Junior guard Joey David has been on the Athletic
Director’s Honor Roll every term.

David named scholar-athlete

Pitt basketball player Joey David
was named Big East Male Scholar
Athlete of the Year for his outstand-
ing performance in the classroom.
David, a junior pre—med/ neuro-
science major from Upper St. Clair,
received a $3,000 scholarship for
graduate school. He has maintained
a 3.0 or better QPA every term and
plans to attend medical school.

“I’m going to apply this spring,”
David said. “Right now it is a matter
of getting in there and being
accepted. I don’t know what I want
to specialize in. I'm not the type to sit
at a desk, though. I want to be occu-
pied. I want to do something that is
interesting and a challenge.”

 

David, who has been named to the
Athletic Director‘s Honor Roll
every term, has done a good job
balancing his school work with
basketball.

“It’s all a matter of having a time
schedule down," he explained. “lfl
don’t study after practice then I
won’t get it done until the next night.
It is not that bad, though, because I
know I have to study and I do it on
my free time. Sometimes, though, I
think it would be so easy to bejust a
student.”
