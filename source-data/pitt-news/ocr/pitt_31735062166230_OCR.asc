New Board
Headed By.
By Masoner

, The University has established
a Board’ of Religion for the pur-
pose of stimulating and encour-
aging the religious growth of stu-
dents.

Establishment of the Board,
which is made up of faculty mem-
bers ancl student representatives,
was undertaken by Dr. Charles
H. Peake, assistant chancellor in
charge of student affairs at the
University. Its chairman is Dr.
Paul Masoner, dean of the School
of Education. '

The Board has four primaryob—
jectives. First, it will seek to work
out a statement of objectives for
the University program of religion
which would define the Univer-
sity’s role in furthering the
growth of its students in the area
of religious thought and experi-
ence. ' ’

Secondly, the Board will study
and attempt to implement a report
on the religious program at Pitt

, made two years ago by a commit-

tee headed by Dr. William P. Tol-
ley, chancellor of Syracuse Uni-
versity. -

A third objective of the Board
will be to examine the present re.-
ligious program to determine its
strengths and weaknesses. The
fourth goal is to discover ways
and means by which the Uni-
versity may achieve its objec-
tives.

“The establishment of the Board
of Religion is a major step toward

nation to follow.

By’ JIM MARINO
A Students at the University
of Pittsburgh have the oppor-
tunity to demonstrate to the
nation a plan to wipe out
crippling polio in one‘ year
while receiving free shots of

the vaccine for themselves.

According to an announcement
by Dr. Edward Litchﬁeld, chancel-
lor of the University, all Pitt stu-
dents, graduate, undergraduate
and part time, will receive all
three shots necessary for immun-
ity to the disease without charge
on Feb. 27, 28 and Mar. 1, 2.

' The program will be watched
and reported by national press and
television services. The Commons
Room which will be the center of
operations in the mass innocu1-
ation program will be the focal
point of the nation’s attention.

Cooperation Urgent

For this reason the full coop-
eration of the entire student body
will be of utmost importance. The
demonstration of the practicality
of mass innoculations at Pitt will
set an example for institutions
across the nation. "A

It has been stated by an num-
ber of leading scientists and
medical men that if such /a pro-
gram were adopted on a na-
tional scale some 98 per cent of
the cases of poliomyelitis other-
wise expected for this summer
may be prevented. .

All three shots will be given
free at Pitt. The second shots will
be givenvwithin four to six weeks
of the ﬁrst and the third booster
shots will be given after a seven
month period.

Two Shot Minimum

This will mean that all students '

will receive at least two of the
necessary shots. Graduating sen-
iors can then arrange for the third
innoculation with their family
doctor.

T No speciﬁc appointments for
the organization of the student
Vprogi-am have been made by Dr.
Litchﬁeld at this time. How-
ever, Theodore W. Biddle, dean

“Yes, you’ll start in the thick of things

as a Burroughs engineer.”

(Put yourself in this student engineer’s shoes
for a minute as he asks a Burroughs representative
some important questions.)

_What do you mean I’ll start ‘‘in the thick of
things”? ' '

I mean you’ll start on the’ work you’re
trained for; you won’t be a man who gets
lost in a shuﬁle.

What kind of work would be open to me at
Burroughs?

Research and development in ballistic
missiles, electronics, computation, data pro-
cessing, optics, magnetics, communications
and electro-mechanics—to méntion a few.

Will all my work be in defense?

No. Burroughs is a worldwide leader in the '

business machines and data processing ﬁelds.
Of course, we’ve many defense contracts too.
And that involves fascinating work in
mechanics, electro-mechanics and electronics.

Are all your plants in Detroit?‘
No. We’re really on a global scale. Detroit’s

° the home oﬂice, of course. Our big research

center’s in Pemisylvania. We have plants in
New York, Michigan, New Jersey, California
‘and Pennsylvania in the U. S., and in Canada,
Great Britain, France and Brazil.

 

Q.

Q.

A.

What about my future at Burroughs?

We at Burroughs feel that young engineers
are the key to Burroughs’ future expansion.
Though our engineering staff has increased
seven times since the end of World War II,
‘we are just on the threshold _of our biggest
expansion. This, plus our promotion-from-’
within policy, assures an outstanding future
for engineers joining Burroughs now!

What about retirement plans, hospitalization,
vacations—-you know, the .fri~ngc beneﬁts, I
think they’re called?

Burroughs is noted for these! In fact, Bur-
roughs pioneered many of them. You’ll have
hospitalization insurance for both you and
your dependents, secure retirement, and
educational aid programs, paid vacations and
sick beneﬁts, to mention a few.

Religious Recognition ‘
_For a longtime the religious activities of students at

the University have been somewhat uncoordinated and

mostly decentralized. The various religious groups have

operated on the campus as independent entities and were
not under the.University’s auspices.

The formation of the Board of Religion at Pitt is per-
haps the ﬁrst step in the establishment of permanent reli-
gious activities sponsored by the Urtiversity. Such activi-
ties would be in keeping with the ideas of organic ‘com-
pleteness in the anticipated “new Pitt.”

A, student should have at his University a chance to

iﬁnd himself religiously. In the learning and growing at-

mosphere of the college life, a student should realize the
value and position of religious activities in his future. He
should have time to exchange ideas and meet with people
of his own and other faiths. This "exchange can overcome
self—conﬁdence and the possible origins of bigotry in the
development of his ideas of brotherhood. _ ’

It,is the duty of the University to foster such religious
growth and learning in its students. It is interesting to see
thatithe expansion plans for the University include a de-
velopment of this too-often neglected and very important
area of education. A

The objectives of the new board have been clearly
stated. The order in which they hope to proceed is logical

and should produce the desired results. It is composed of

faculty, administration and students with a good represen-
tation of each in number and quality.

By Jay Butler /

I The clue to the vague dissatisfaction I feel now
after my ﬁrst semester at Pitt was, I think, present
at the very beginning. I found Freshman Week
signiﬁcant in two respects. The ﬁrst was the over-
whelming efficiency, the coordination, the machine-
ry, that was and is Pitt. The second was the re-
peated assurance by the endless speakers through-
out that weekthat in spite of A ’
the efﬁciency and coordination—-
the factory system, Pitt was de-
signed to produce not simply
trained persons, but educated
men and women.

Basic Conflict ,

Here was the essential de-
lineation of forces in the basic
conﬂict of education at Pitt, the
same conﬂict that faces every p
other university in the country. The problem re-
duced to its simplest terms reads, “How do we
reconcile the massive system with the diverse
needs of individual students?”

I will not pretend that a failure to make this
reconciliation is any more responsible for “stagna-
tion” at Pitt thanthe library-situation, provincial-
ism, fraternity-ism, privilegeism, hierarch-ism, or
any other corrosive element in the Pitt system. I
do, however, believe that a failure to descend from
the level of student in the abstract, a conveniently
statistical entity, toward the unweildy reality of
student in the speciﬁc, is largely responsible, and
perhaps to a greater degree than any other factor,
for the negative aspects of education at Pitt.

Freshman Orientation tests, Men’s Conference
sections, Core Curriculum, and distribution ﬁelds,
all designed to assure that the individual makes
the most of himself, witness the administration’s
awareness» of the conﬂict.

These devices, however, which in the beginning
promised so much toward educating the total
man, have since come to represent the core of the

    

’ difﬁculty. In trying to remedy the inadequacies of
mass-production education, t.h‘elad_ministration has.

turned to techniques of reaching the individual
which are themselves derived from the assembly
line and as such are doomed to failure.
Dissatisfaction ,

The blue IBM card with my “personality”
punched out in neat rectangles and its accompany-
ing mimeographed explanation, the single ﬁfteen-

 
   

minute private interview given each of us fresh-
men by our “conference” leader, and the history
recitation instructor’s explanation that we would
prepare map studies instead of book reports be-
cause the reports took too long to grade, all con-
tributed to a growing dissatisfaction.

I hadn’t then heard about the few credit-hours
of electives allowed the engineers in their four-
year dash to save the country from technological
anemia; nor had I yet come to fully realize the
futility of trying tointroduce the average fresh-
man to Bach, Aristotle, Arthur Miller, and Van-
Gogh at the rate of three Humanities Core Curricu-
lum hours per week. . .

I seriously doubt that the engineers ﬁnd any-
thing of real signiﬁcance about themselves or any-.
thing else, except engineering, on a yearly ration
of credit-hour’s freedom_ of choice. There is a

point I think between a student’s feeling his way

Machinery of Education ,

-4(~' ‘

along blind and somebody’s dragging him by the /

hand at which the student does some exploring on
his own with somebody there to pull him back
when he gets to the quicksand.

Missed Point \
That is the point that I think has been missed.
I think it has been missed in the Core Curriculum
in the assumption that any group of college stu-
dents will be commonly ignorant of major areas
of our culture. It has been missed for freshman
engineers in supposing that an imposed year-course

I

of Political Science. will have relative carry-over ‘

meaning. It has been missed in Men’s Conference

by supposing that exposition of an abstract of prob-A ‘ .

lems statistically held in common by the group
will be of any use as a guide when the all-im-
portant, single, personal problem occurs.

All three of them miss in supposing that an
understanding of the mind built through logic
that a thing is right and essential to an educated
man is the same thing as a conviction of the spirit
that it is so. -

,It is time perhaps to examine the assembly line
with a view to inserting some hand-ﬁnishing along
the way. Without a sense of the individual there
will be no sense of the community, and an insti-
tution of learning cannot be successful without
both security of the individual and the dynamism
of community.

Mr?

In spite of Time magazine, all the bright shinyrw

new chancellors in the world aren’t going to stop
the “stagnation” at the University of Pittsburgh
until somebody convinces the average student that
education consists of more than a course in sur-"
vival.

A Sesh With Satch I

IIGIIJS

By Phil Moshe!
From the desk of this Jazz fan

a comes an interview from the

Shakespeare of the jazz world,
Louis Armstrong. Louis appear-
ed before the people of Pitts-
b u r g h 1 a s t
W e d n e s d a y I
evening at th
Syria Mosque.
The ﬁrst par
of the‘ program
showed Eddi
Heywood at hi
to e s t. E d d i
opened up the =
ﬁrst half of the
s e t w i t h a a
driving, swing-
ing beat and
swung the audience from th e
ﬁrst balcony. The crowd clapped

 

 

 

 
 

themselves into a frenzy, typical
of the people present. Heywood‘

then ad—libbed into “Soft Sum-
mer Night’s Breeze.” The rock-
ing in the seats and tapping

showed the music lovers at the G‘

height of their ectasy in the ﬁrst
half of the swinginest show this
side of the coast.

Louis “Satchmo” Armstrong
came on loud and clear and kill-
ed all the music Heywood had
swung the audience with. Louis
broke the sound barrier with
some of the sounds that showed
in New Orleans during the
“Jazz Era.” ‘

Louis was one of the audience
throughout the‘ set, and was as
informal as an artist can be with

an audience. Louis bowed and,

the people were really swinging.
Cordial Louis

Louis took the audience" like
Sophocles took the world of
English teachers. The people saw
a show that would forever live

 

 

in their memory. '
After the: show the crowd

stormed the dressing room with

programs in hand, waiting for
Louis to autograph them. The
press and Louis’ family were
crowded into the small dressing
room. The guests were received
with a cordiality that would stun
the more minor (musicians of the
profession. As I walked through
the door Louis immediately in-
troduced ‘me to the other people
present. I had only talked to
Louis for a short time but in the
course of the conversation .I
knew “Pops” as‘ I knew my
brother.

aLouis’ manager took the situ-
ation in hand and attempted to
usher the autograph hunters out
the door. Louis looked up and
said, “Let the cats stay cuz.” The
question of the moment was, “Is’
Satch’ a nice guy or isn’t he!”

‘Don't’ Fight the ‘Cats

The room cleared of all the
people and “Satch” agreed to
answer a few questions, while he
was changing clothes.

“Satch” what kind of music
do you listen to in your spare
time? ,

Well, all kinds. I listen to
whatever’s playin.

At what age did you start your
career. in music? a _

Well, I guess about eighteen.

What do you think of the
music polls, “Down Beat,”
Satch? _

Well, man, I don’t ﬁght the
cats because they’re doin’a job
and I ﬁgure if that’s the way
they feel. You kiiow.

What was the most! exciting.

event in your life as a jazz music
cian? V . e _
Well, I think whenever I went

 

 

to Chicago to play second trump-
et _for Joe (“King”) Oliver. Joe
was the greatest guy ana.mus1-
cian I ever knew.

“Satch” what did you think
England? -

Great! Those cats over.there
really did it up right. They gave
me a big suite of rooms and
treated me ﬁne. All the songs
and numbers were arranged for
me when I got there. The cats
were always sayin’ to me “Eat
up ‘Satch’ plenty more left. “So

I was really havin a ball and .

when I was checkin out of the
hotel the boys laid a food bill on
me for ﬁve hundred dollars.
The Artist's Rights

What was the actual difficulty
between you and the Philhar-
monic orchestra?

Those cats wanted me to stay

off the st-age when I ﬁnished so ..

they could show the queen some-
thing. They wouldn’t let me take

a bow, and every artist has the!

right to do that. I went back out
on, the stage and showed the
boys 3. good show! i ,

How did you acquire the nick-
name “Satch?”

Well, it’s a contraction of
“Satchmo,” which means “so
much mouth.” The name was
given to me by my trombone
player.

“Pops?!
jazz?

Good music. You have to play
what you feel. If you’d take

how do you deﬁne

- away the music I play I wouldn't

have a means of expression.
Take away any musician’s horn
and he’s hung.

The people came storming into“
the dressing room for the one
and only “Satch,” to sign auto-
graphs.

How WAS THE CROOK TOOK‘?

QUIMBY, WISC. (March 3).
Police today arrested the foul
felon who‘ heisted the cash reg-
ister at ‘Jones’ Gas Station.
When arrested, the base serv-
ant of the devil kept mutter-
irlilg, “Drat the shirt, drat the
s 1r .”

Let’s» look at the events
leading up to this story. After
the holdup, the police quizzed
Victim Jones. Jones couldn't
identify the yegg. “The wan-
ton jackdaw who cabbaged my
cash wore a mask,” said Jones.
“The only distinguishing fea-
ture about him was his shirt.
A beauty! The collar was ab-
solutely free of wrinkles. Oh,
he was a neat one!” _

Meanwhile, the scoundrel,
knowing that his wrinkle—free
and enviably-neat collar was a
dead giveaway, tried desper-

ately to slip some wrinkles into
it. He stamped on it with hob-
nail boots. He slugged away
at it with a club. But not a
wrinkle! So later, as he skulked
down Main Street, his shirt
was noticed, admiringly, by a

' detective and he was arrested

lickety-split. Good work,
copper!

By now you will’ have
guessed that the miscreant
wore a Van Heusen Century
Shirt. But of course! It’s the
only shirt in the world with the
soft‘ collar that won’t wrinkle
ever. It never needs starch,
so it’s always comfortable. The
Van Heusen Century also lasts
up to ‘twice as long as ordinary

. shirts, yet costs no more. $4.00.

Cal Paces All-Opponent

_ The team that handed the Panther gridders their most
surprising defeat of their best season since 1938, the Cali-

fornia Golden Bears, had the honor of placing the most“

players on the 1956 Pitt All-Opponent team.

Three of the Bears’ burly line-6

men make up just about half of
the line. They are end Norm Beck-
er, tackle Proverb Jacobs, and
guard Don Gilkey. In the West-
erners’ e a r 1 y '
season shut—out
over the local
gridders, Beck-
er snagged six
p a s s e s for 62
yards a n d one
touchdown.

G i 1 k e y were
t w o o f t h e
causes why the
locals failed to score against Cal.

.foe, Georgia Tech, and another

team from south of the border,
Miami, were next in‘ line on the
All-Opponent eleven with two men
each. The Engineers took care of
half the backﬁeld with‘ quarter-
back Wade Mitchell and halfback
Stan Flowers. In Tech’s 21-14 tri-
umph over the Jungle Cats in the
Gator Bowl, Mitchell booted the
three extra points and intercepted
a crucial fourth quarter pass. ,
Flowers carired the ball only
four times, but managed to grind
out 63 yards.

Tankers Lose

But Set Record

Even though the Panther
swimmers won both the med-
ley relay and freestyle relay
for the ﬁrst time this season,

they still could not break out of
their season—long tailspin as they
lost to Virginia Military Institute,
44-42.

The local mermen, who now have
won one meet out of six, led the
visitors throughout the ﬁrst six
events; but a one-two ﬁnish in
the 200-yard backstroke gave the
Southerners a ﬁve point advant-
age at 33-28.

From that point on the Military
opened up their lead to as much
as. 12 points with another sweep,
this time in the 440—yard freestyle.
The Panthers made the ﬁnal tally
respectable with a ﬁrst and a third
in the 200-yard breaststroke and
a victory in the 400—yard freestyle
relay. ~v

Ben Grady’s mermen started -
oﬂ the meet at the Pittsburgh
Athletic Association pool with ~
an electrifying record-breaking
win in the 400-yard medley re-
lay.

The quartet of Don Weber, Ed
Robson, Gene Adams, and Ben
Sklar swam the relay in 41:15.4,
a new PAA mark. Sklar, who was
a standout member of last year’s
Eastern championship squad, has
returned to the water after a sem-
ester layoff. He also swam on the

’ winning freestyle relay team.

Warne White, Panther captain,
and Lou Durbin captured the next
‘two events, the 220-yard and the
50-yard freestyles, to give the
locals an early 18-7 lead. Durbin
later won the 100—yard freestyle
and Robson took the breaststroke
for the only other Panther ﬁrsts.
The other members of the free-
style relay squad besides Sklar
were Ken Cooper, Weber, and
Durbin.

Frosh Matnien Succumb

After Taking First Three

The freshman wrestlers won the
ﬁrst three matches of the evening
at Lehigh Saturday but the Engi-
neers roared back to sweep the
ﬁnal ﬁve and down the Panther
Cub matmen, 23-11.

Lehigh was aided by a default
in the 167-pound class which was
a. decisive factor in the ﬁnal
score.

 

American Don Bosseler at full-
back and Jack Johnson, a Pitts-
burgh boy, at end. Johnson dis-
played his best talent with his toe,
however, with a game punting
average of 35 yards. He was also
tough to run against on defense.

Four other teams placed one
man each on the squad. Army back
Bob Kyasky, West Virginia cen-
ter Chuck Howley, tackle Frank
Youso of Minnesota, and Oregon
guard Harry Mondale complete the
1956 team.

_Jimmy Brown and Paul Horn-
ung, a pair of recognized All-
Americans, failed to win a place
in the All-Opponent backﬁeld.

“Who?” said Anna Livia Plurabelle. .

“Werther Sigafoos,” said Werther Sigafoos. “I sit
next to you in psych. I’m kind of dumpy and I always
wear a sweatshirt.” '

“I’m afraid I don’t remember you,” said Anna Livia.

A Campus-to—Career Case

History

Manager Joseph S. Manning discusses a customer service

request with Oﬂice Supervisor Catherine Hazleton.

Joseph S. Manning graduated in 1950
from Wesleyan University with a B.A. de-
gree and a major in Bio-Chemistry. But
chemistry, he decided, was not to be his
career. He became intrigued, instead, by
the opportunities’ in the telephone busi-
ness, and joined New York Telephone
Company in 1951. ‘ ’

Today Ioe Manning is Business Oﬂice

Manager in Parkchester, Bronx, New
York. In this position he is responsible
for about 27,000 telephone accounts
which bill some $250,000 a month; 3

people work under him. v .

“It’s like having‘ your own $3,000,000
business,” Joe says. “And it’s pretty much

Bell Telephone Companies offer many interesting
career opportunities, as do Bell Telephone
Laboratories, Western Electric and Sandia Cor-
poration. Your placement officer has more in- '
formation about all Bell System Companies. I I

an independent operation,’ which I enjoy.
I’m in charge of ‘all business oﬂice func-
tions, and of personnel training and de-
velopment. I also spend a lot of time out
with my customers, making sure that they
have the telephone service they want and
need. It’s an absorbing job.

“The phenomenal growth of the busi-
ness is one of the reasons why advance-
ment opportunities are so good in the
telephone company. Since 1943, for ex-
ample, the number of telephones in our
area has almost tripled. Growth such as
this, going on all over the country, makes
-the telephone business especially attrac-
tive to anyone seeking a career with a
future.”

“Oh, yes!” she said. “What do you wish, Walter?”

“Werther,” said Werther. “What I wish is to take
you to the Junior Prom next April.”

“That’s months away, Westnor,” said Anna Livia.

“Werther,”’ said Werther. “Yes, I know, but you are
so round and beautiful that I was afraid you might
have a date already.” '

“Asa matter of fact I do, Wingate,” said Anna Livia.
“Werther,” said Werther. ‘,‘Oh, drat!”

    

“ T772 hWo/ 0/I17///17/677/0/I .7/u/.775 W&7f'c7 Sveifshzrf /

Anna Livia did notpreally have a date, but she was_
expecting to be asked by Stewart Stalwart, athlete and
BMOC, handsome as Apollo, smooth as ivory, driver of
a 2.9 litre Bugatti, wearer of faultless‘ tweeds, smoker
of Philip Morris Cigarettes, which, even without his
other achievements, would by itself stamp him as a man
of «discrimination, as the possessor of a pleasure-oriented
palate, as one who smoked for the pure joy of it, who had
sought and found a cigarette brimming over with zest
and zip and hearty good fellowship — Philip Morris!

Well. sir, Anna Livia waited for Stewart to ask her,
but two days before the Prom, to everybody’s amazement,
he asked Rose-of-Sharon Kinsolving, a nondescript girl
with pavement colored hair and a briefcase. '

Anna Livia sobbed for a -spell and then, not wishing
to missvthe most gala event of the junior year, she
phoned Werther Sigafoos. 

. “My Prom date has come down with a dread virus,”
she said, “and, I’ll accept your invitation, Waldrop.”

.“Werther,” said Werther. “Oh, goodyganders!”

The next day Anna Livia received a phone call from
Stewart Stalwart. “My Prom date has come down with
a dread virus,” he said. “Will you go with me ?”. ~

“Certainly,” she said and immediately phoned Wer-
ther and said, "I have come down with a dread virus and
cannot go to the Prom with you, Whipstitch.”

“Werther,” said Werther. “Oh, mice and rats!”

So Anna Livia went to the Prom with Stewart and
who do you think they ran into? Rose-of-Sharon with
Werther, that's who! .

Stewart had felt obliged to ask Rose-of-Sharon be-
cause she always did his homework, but she had weaseled
out because she really wanted to go with Werther with
whom she felt a great oneness because they were both
so dumpy. He fell wildly.in love with her at the Prom,
and today they are married and run a very successful
ﬁve-minute auto-wash in New Bern, N. C

_* Anna Livia and Stewart are happy too. They are
still Juniors and have not missed a Prom in six years.

The shoe is on the other foot

Soon you will decide on the kind of company in,

which you want to invest the knowledge you liave
acquired through engineering education.

You will probably have more companies to

consider than those who graduated before you . . .‘

many more than the men who collected their sheep-
skins before 1950. While the number of engineering
graduates once exceeded the number of openings,
today there are more good opportunities than there
are capable young men to, pick up the pay checks.
In short, the shoe is on the other foot-YOUR foot!

Although We recognize that fact, we cannot
relax our standards. We still want only those who
have the creative spark, the imagination, the talent
to make important contributions in our organiza-
tion. No doubt you will understand why . . . when
you read our booklet. It tells about the exciting
progress of helicopters and indicates something of
the part Sikorsky has played and will play in
their development. ’

This informative booklet is yours for the
writing, no strings attached. Should yoti becono
sidering Sikorsky as a company where you might
like to get started, then tell us, too, a little about
yourself. Address your letter to Mr. Richard Auten
at our Bridgeport Personnel Department.
