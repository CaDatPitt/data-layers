The main researchers on this
{project will be Dr. W. Arthur

professor of microbiology. They
hope to find materials and meth-
ods that will help the practicing

they are five, and that admitting
them early does no harm, while
holding them back may deprive
them of important advantages.
The project is under the direction
of Dr. Jack Birch, head of the

‘Early Admits’

The first “early admits” Will
enter school this September, and
will be evaluated at the end of
eight months. About 20 three-and-
four-year-olds are expected to en-
roll at the six schools.

According to Birch the ad-
'vantages of such as system are:

mental age a child is less likely
to develop habits of dawdling;
the child admitted early re-
ceives the regular amount of
schooling and can still enter col-
lege earlier: and early admission
eliminate the need {or skipping

Chemical Engineers continued
to dominate the National loop
with a 7-3 win over the second-
place Yankees in the Intramural
softball league.

The undefeated Psych. Dept.
continued their winning ways with
their fourth triumph last Tuesday
over the injury-ridden Student
Afi'airs squad. As a result of their
second loss, Student Affairs drop-
ped to fourth place.

Jim Weingard‘s three consecu-

gineers to their fourth straight
win last Friday. Gus Leoleos al-
lowed the Yankees only three
runs in picking up his fourth vic-
tory of the season. Jim Jaffe and
Fred Kunken had two hits apiece
for the losers, who, ironically,
outhit the Engineers.

The Losers continued to keep

Losers to the 16-4 victory with a

show that Ron Supansie and

A1 Riccuiti led the Panther hitters this season. To anyone
that followed the Panther box scores this is not a surprise.

Supansic, the flashy second baseman batted .340 once he
passed into his sophomore year and became eligible to play.
Riccuiti fell off quite a bit from his average of last year,

wise to him.
His average against collegiate
competition was .323, but if the
three exhibition games the Panth-
ers played against Army opposi-
tion are counted the shortstop hit
.392.

Behind Riccuitti and Supansic
in the hitting parade come Corky
Cuthbert and John Cioffi. Cuth-
bert batted .291 against college
foes and .320 overall. Cioffi hit
.281 in collegiate play and raised
his average to .292 against the
service teams.

After these four the hitting
tailed of! quite a bit. Paul
Martha, Drew Williamson and
Barry Wetzel were the only
other team members above .200.
