' Registration was much smoother this year for most stu-
dents because of the newly implemented “mail-in” system,
according to Richard Hodges,

Hodges added that there were several difficulties which
affected someofr thestudents. Many of the course election
records were not turned in early enough.

cause no goodtime schedule was

of this was my fault,” he explain-
ed, “and the other half was caus-
ed by the’ people who made
changes in the time schedule after
it was already completed.”
Another problem which con-

fronted many students was lost

try to get him the requested sched-

fact that we handle the people
coming in for registration with a
staff smaller than that used for

indicate that as a whole it was

some confusion on .the first day

SC To Begin Book Exchange

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER ,_ 6, .1960 .

Today.

Liberal Arts Texts Only

Books Involved in Sale

Students will now be able to purchase used books at

moderate prices.

A student book exchange, sponsored by Student Govern-
ment under the chairmanship of Jay Fingeret, will be held»
today through Friday on the eighth ﬂoor Cl. Only books
from the School of Liberal Arts will be involved.

Those students who wish to sellO

used books should bring them to
the eighth floor between noon and
2 pm: any day this week.

Ten Cent Fee

A ten cent handling fee will

be charged to both buyers and
sellers. Chuck Isler and Phil Wil-
liams, president and vice presi-
dent, of SG, explained that if any
proﬁt was made it would be used
by student government for a stu-
dent activity such as the Christmas
Ball.
' They explained, “The ex-
change is not being conducted to
make a proﬁt but rather to help
students.”

All the books will be placed on
tables categorized by department.
Each book will include the name
of thestudent who is selling it,
his phone number, and the amount
requested for the book.

Unsold Books Returned

Each day from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.
the tables will be open for stu-

dents to make purchases. On Fri-
day those persons who left““—books

to be sold will return between
3 p.m. and 5 pm.

If their books have been sold,
they will receive the amount of
money listed on the card. If
they have not been sold, their
books will be returned to them.

The Student Book Exchange

hopes to solve some of the pro-
blems which have caused a con-

siderable amount of trouble and ‘

inconvenience in past years by
providing a place where students
can buy and sell their used text-
books. .

Isler and Williams concluded,
“This is just one of many things
that has been planned to beneﬁt
students this year. We plan to
institute as many things as pos-
sible before February.”

DOM Office Plans
To Revamp Men’s

Council Program

Incoming freshmen will no
longer spend 15 weeks learning
how to study.

The office of the Dean of‘Men
has announced a revamping of the
Men’s Council Orientation Pro-
gram. In past years freshmen have
spent the major portion of the
trimester learning how to spend
their study time. .

“A new policy has been
formed this year,” Dean of Men

William Crafts said. “Many
who have taught in orientation
have expressed the opinion that
Men’s Council has failed to meet
the needs of the individual stu-
dents. This we hope to correct.”

The new plan is scheduled to‘

run for seven weeks with the
program combining both lectures
and discussions. The counselors
will apply case histories of stu-
dents with problems to classroom
situations.

New Food Plan
Uffers Seconds

Beginning

cines for

 

this trimester, the
University’s food service will be
operated by Saga, a company
which services 83 other colleges
and universities from New Eng-
land to the West Coast. ’

The kitchen. equipment inherit-
ed from the preceding food serv-
ice concern has been well clean-
ed and repainted.

Mr. Troy ‘O’Brien, a Saga sup-
ervisor newly arrived from the
West, stressed Saga’s desire to
hear the opinions of students con-
cerning items which they would
like included on the menu.

“During meal times,” said Mr.
O’Brien, “you will see managers"
on the ﬂoor constantly, asking
students what they think of our
service."

Mr. O’Brien also pointed out
that Saga’s standards will not per-
mit the serving of secon‘d—r_ate
food. “The manager in charge
tests every item on the serving
line before the line is permitted to
open,” he said. “Today we threw
out three pans of eggs because
they were runny.” He mentioned
too, that Saga’s policy of buying
its steaks and meat cut “prefa-
bricated,” that is, ready cut, eli-
minates leftovers and scraps.

Saga’s policy for boarding stu-
dents, that is, those with meal
tickets, is one of “unlimited sec-
onds.” There is no need for a
student to load his tray, since he
may return at will for a second
or third helping. This policy
has, of course, necessitated the

' separation of the boarding stu-

dents from the cash students.

In the Hunt Room, the menu
has been augmented by the addi-
tion of french fries, chile dogs, and
custom sandwiches.

A few of the other colleges em-
ploying this service are Arizona
State University, University of
Vermont, California Institute of
Technology, C h a t h a m College,

,Oberlin College, West Virginia
« Wesleyan College, Wells College,

‘and the University of Western
Illinois.

-Efren Eiseley’s ‘The F irmament of Time’ 
Anthropologist Sets
 Scientific   History  

_, I By ARVID DUERR
“Hoyv natural is ‘natural’?” ‘is the intriguing question
considered by Loren Eiseley in “The Firmament of Time”

I published in July by Atheneum Press at $3.50.

In this volume, composed of six lectures which Dr.
Eisely delivered in the autumn of 1959, we ﬁnd an amalgam
ofthe attitudes of his two earlier works, the scholarly “Dar-

win’s Century’; and the imagina-Le

tive “Immense Journey.”
' “From the very begirining he
urges us to extend our knowl-
edge of scientiﬁc history for “it

“is a study which should bring
into the .laboratory andl the
classroom not only greater toler-
ance for the ideas of others but
a clearer realization that even
the scientiﬁc atmosphere evolves
andichanges with the society of
which it is a part.”

A student who has become
aware of this is not only capable
of more creative activity but also,
perhaps, hasia broader horizon as
a human being. .

Death Unnatural

These broad understandings did
not exist in ethnocentric eighteenth
century Europe, “the cozy best-
of-all-possible-worlds which has
been created speciﬁcally for men,”
and where life was taken for
granted. Death was the unnatural
thing, and “the hint of extinction
in the geological past was like a

‘cold wind out of a dark ce1lar.”

But ‘gradually, to account for
the record of the strata which
showed “no vestige of a begin-.
ning, and no prospect of an
end,” but only perpetual change
in form, extinction and hence
death began to be natural.

As life, too,'begins to become
natural, we are reminded of the
“Snout” from The Immense Jour-
ney by a poetic passage so char-
acteristic of Eiseley’s writing in
which he alludes to the fact that
“the stars that caught our blind
amphibian stare have shifted far
or vanished in their courses, but
still that naked, gleaming thread

i:

winds onward.
Beginning Unknown

“No one‘knows the secret of its
beginning or its end. Its forms are
phantoms. The thread alone is
real; the thread is life.”

Dr. Eiseley demonstrates’ that
“it is the human gesture by which
we know a man, though he looks
out upon us under a brow re-
miniscent of the ape.”

For even ﬁfty thousand years
ago, from the grave offerings
found in France, it can be seen
that men laid down their dead in
grief.

From these humble begin-
nings, man has been able to rise
to the heights of _Western scien-
tiﬁc achievement, achievement
which has concentrated upon
things and not upon the creation
of better human beings.

Nature, however, is secure; for
even “when the last seared hand
has flung the last grenade, an
older version of that hand will
be stroking a clinging youngster
hidden in its fur, and will think
of beginning again . . . again, in
a different way . .

The specialist would criticize
this book because few of these
facts, although they are metic-
ulously correct, are footnoted ac-
cording to the scholarly tradition;
however, these essays originally

appeared as a lecture series in-

tended to give enlightenment to
the college student,,both as prag-
matist and mystic.

We, also, are reminded that
“schoolrooms are not and should
not be the place where man
learns only scientiﬁc techniques.

    tel your politic”...

Three departments in the University have newly ap-
pointed chairmen, as announced by Dr. Charles H. Peake,
vice chancellor for the academic disciplines.

Dr. Holbert N. Carroll, professor of political science at
the University, has been ‘appointed chairman of the political

science department.

He holds his B.A. and M.A. de-
grees from the University and re-
ceived his Ph.D. from Harvard.
At Harvard he won the 1953 Top-
pan Prize for the best doctoral
dissertation in the ﬁeld of poli-

_ tical science.

Dr. Carroll's major ﬁelds of re-
search and special interest are
American government, admini-
stration and control of foreign
affairs and Far Eastern govern-
ments. In 1958 his book, “The
House of Representatives and
Foreign Affairs” was published
by the University of Pittsburgh
Press.

Dr. Carroll has been a mem-
ber of the faculty since 1946
with the exception of 1949-1950
when he was a teaching fellow
at Harvard University.

Dr. Arman Frederickson has
been named chairman of the Uni-
versity geology department.

He has been research section
supervisor for the Pan-American
Oil Company, Tulsa, Oklahoma.
He was previously professor of
geology at Washington University
in St. Louis, and also held teach-
ing appointmcnts at Montana
School of Mines and Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology.

During 1951-52, he served as
a Fulbright research professor at
the University of Oslo in Norway.

Dr. Carroll is a member of
the American Political Science

0

Association, Phi Beta Kappa,
Omicron Delta Kappa, Phi Eta
Sigma, and Delta Sigma Rho.
Dr. Frederickson received his

sistant dean.

Women’s Choral
Schedules First

Practice Session

The ﬁrst rehearsal of Women's
Choral is scheduled for tomorrow
at 3 p.m. on the ninth floor of the
Cathedral. .

All members are urged to be
present along with any women
students who might be interested
in joining the group.

They are the place where self-
hood, what has been called ‘the
supreme instrument of know-
ledge,’ is created.”

Only such deep inner knowledge
truly expands horizons and makes
use of technology, not for power,
but for human happiness.

Boalrs for Baolrs

If the newly organized Student Book Exchange which
opens today is successful, a great service will have been
rendered University students.

Student Government is to be commended for institut-

ing such a necessary project.
A Bookstores in the area have been making a large proﬁt
on students by paying very little for used books and selling
them at nearly the cost of new books. The University Book
Center revealed last term that it made a 25% proﬁt on each
used book.

The exorbitant prices of used books at the book stores
and the poor resale value of books has resulted in _a sizeable
expense for students, many of whom cannot afford the
extra dollars. _

The Book Exchange can operate‘ successfully only if
enough students participate so that a good selection of
books is made available for exchange.

The success of this project also depends on the willing-
ness: of students to volunteer to work at the Book Exchange.

With a little cooperation, this service of SG can be
offered at the beginning of every triterm.

Praise and A Best Wislies

The promotion of Dr. Donald E. Swarts to the post of
Dean of Johnstown ‘College of the University has been a
great loss to students on the'Oakland campus.

In his positions as Director of Student Publications,
"Associate Dean of Men, and adviser to_a long list of student
organizations, he did work which might have kept several

Newcomers Bewarell   

don’t try to pick it up. The results can be disas-v it
trous. Another thing, don’t try to go through one,

By Jim Vaughan
This being Freshman Advice Month — a period
during which you will be warned of such evils as
studying, attending classes, reading The Pitt News,
and using the words “Penn State” — I have a few

most important words of advice for you: beware

of the revolving doors.

Soon you will learn that the
revolving doors are a basic part
of your higher education, as are
the sounds of tires, sirens, trol-
ley cars, and automobile horns.
The doors represent the first
part of your education, you will
ﬁnd .that they give you your
first tasks as a student.

The revolving doors of the
Cathedral of Learning, especial-
ly, you must watch with a care-

ful eye and nimble foot. If you have classes in the I

Cathedral, you can’t avoid entering the‘ whirling,
sweeping, ﬂapping jaws of one of its mechanical
gauntlets. To get to class each day, you must over-
come a revolving door; you can’t avoid it. Sly,
sneaky, sinister, they lurk in the entranceways
awaiting your happy, unusupecting approach. Be
careful. '1

Pull In The Slack

When you approach a revolving door, keep your!

wits about you. Grab a ﬁrm hold on your books.

Make sure your shoe laces are tied, and that your .

scarf. and coat aren’t trailing. Carelessness here
has dire consequences.

As you may have heard, a girl with a long blond
pony-tail almost got herself scalped this way.

Anything can happen to you if you aren’t care-
ful. Once you manage to get safely into the door
keep alert. Often some clunk will come along right
behind you and give the door an a11—American
heave that clobbers you in theheel.

Inside, if you drop something, for gosh sake

So Short. A Time . . .

 

 

of those revolving doors with a friend, even a close
one. For sure one of you will trip up the other, and
you’ll both wind up being bounced against the
walls like marbles dropped in a bath tub.

One last thing about revolving doors. If you’re
a normal college student you will get the urge

occasionally to save the effort of pushing the door _

by slipping into the rapidly closing opening of I

revolving door; This is a noble thought; but don’t. :
Here’s what can happen to you even if your

timing is perfect: A couple years ago a freshman

had been in the habit of jumping through the_

narrow opening in order to save time and effort.
One day he came tearing up the S. U. steps in
his usual hurry. Before him was the revolving

door slowing down. With the split-second calcula-‘--

tion of a star ballet dancer, he leaped into the
opening without even breaking his stride. '

Unknown to the freshman ’a football player was
running the other way; the football player threw
his weight against the door at the same instant.
Mid-air in his leap the freshman saw himself
caught fast in the jaws of the door. Thereha
dangled a foot above the ﬂoor; his head, shoulder,
arm and leg struggled on the inside, the rest of
him, on the outside. Too frightened to call -for help,
he gasped for air.

Double lWhammy

’ r ‘The poor freshman was at such an angle with
the door that he couldn’t be seen. Thrashing about,
he must have made the football player think some-

one was playing games; the big guy pushed back
all the harder.

The freshman was finally noticed. Swiftly hefelt
the door pulled away. And even more swiftly he felt
himself hit the floor. After collecting myself and
my books, I stood up and proceeded cautiously to
enter the S.U. resolved always to bewarelof the

revolving doors. ‘ _

A Note For Freshmen

By Ina Ammdlwr
Dear Freshman:

You have just been the victims and the surviv-
ors of the pre-college treat for beginning students
called Orientation Week. Many wise people have
exhorted you not to fight with your roommates,

to become “whole men,” not to give up your re-

ligion before discussing its pros
and cons with the university re-
ligious leader, and to carry a"
clean handkerclnef at all times.
As you have been herded from 
place to place and from speech to
speech, so much varied advice
has probably been thrust at you
that by this time you must won-
der how anyone manages to ‘A
graduate from college at all. It is
not so difficult, however, nor 
it solcomplicated as some would
have you believe.

One settles into the routine very quickly and
without much trouble. The real danger is that you
may lose your perspective concerning the pur-
pose of your stay at college. It should be much
more than a meaningless and somewhat mon-
otonous routine of early morning coffee, of mem-
orizing the proper word at the proper time, and
of participating in a certain number of meetings. a

week in order to show the skeptical world about

you that you really are well-rounded.
Rewards Are Delayed

The fruits of time well-spent in college may
not be plucked until manyyears later. Even your
coveted grades cannot reveal what you have ac-
complished at the university. Thoreau once -said
that “most men live lives of quiet desperation.“ If
you become one of these men or women, caught
in a boring routine, culminated in the evening by a
television set and a bottle‘ of beer, then college
has not helped so much after all. For four years
you will live with and read about the -profound
thoughts and the prophetic visions which men
have possessed, and you will become acquainted
with the universal hopes, sufferings, and joys
which men have known.

With their help life should never become an un-
conscious processor a frantic quest to end bore-
dom. Boredom results from blindness, from seeing
only through your own eyes. Art, literature, music,
or any artistic endeavor, are attempts to cause
one to see the world through another’s eyes. Tran-
quilizers and alcohol may change your vision of
the world, but they are not nearly so effective as
Beethoven, Plato, or Shakespeare. One method
dulls your awareness and another heightens it:

   

 

Education is partially the process of heightening
one’s awareness and of increasing one’s sensitivity.

Awareness ls Heiglutened

- College, in particular, is a place where one’:
awareness may be heightened by the possession
of an idea. An idea may becomegyours, only after
you have toyed with it, nurtured it, and convinced
it that you understand it fully enough so that it
may give itself to you in confidence without fear
that your will betray it.‘ In these days of glib
conversations over punch-bowls, and of casual

name—dropping at cocktail parties, one is tempted’

to join the suave voices and to talk about matters
of which one is ignorant. .
This habit of betrayal is easy to acquire, dif-

ficult to break, and leads to disastrous conse-_

quences. One never. again feels at home in the
world of ideas the initial struggle to understand

fully is no longer necessary, and with the disap-

pearance of the struggle one no longer has the
joy of the victory. ‘

As difficult as it is to possess an idea, it" is
more difficult to possess oneself during four busy

years of college. Solitude» is not provided, is not ,

advised, and does not count toward graduation.
Yet the student who doesnot take the time to
become reacquainted with himself does not de-
serve to graduate. It is an American myth that
the desire for solitude‘ is a little bit unhealthy,
perhaps even indicative of slight maladjustment. "
Self-Knowledge _

This opinion prevails because only in solitude
can "one falteringly explore the depths of ‘one’s
own personality, and introspection does not seem to
be in vogue. Yet the attempt to understand the
mysterious, transitory essence of oneself is just as
necessary an endeavor as the learning of subject
matter. We live and die without knowing anyone
completely and with knowing a few, 3 handfu]
of people, partially. But to live and die without
attempting to know oneself even partially can be
attributed only to laziness and fear.

There is so much to learn, to experience, and to
become aware of that four years is all too little
time. “Time’s winged chariot” is always present,
warning one to make haste. A lecturer who was
once speaking to college students admonished
them not to play bridge. During the question
period, a co-ed inquired why they had been given

this advice. The lecturer answered simply and

intensely, “There isn’t time.” You have four years
in which you can make a truce with time or in
which you can let it conquer you. It is certain
that you will never conquer it. but peaceful co-
existence in‘ this case is“ as good as a victory.

Cats Preparing f

Michelosen Has C-Boys,
Ditka,‘ Vignali Back

3} JACK SMITH
Was there ever a coach that would come right out and

pick his team as a winner?

While Panther followers have great expectations for the
coming football season, Coach John Michelosen clings to the
pessimistic vine that is so characteristic of gridiron coaches.

Blest with a ﬁne crop

ends and guards, and a backﬁeld,O

C-Boys by name, that has already

' gained ‘a reputation, the Panthers

have been pre-season rated by
many as a power in both the East
and nation. I
C—Boys Shine

But Michelosen has taken into

account a schedule that would

"make an Arab shiver. With teams

like Syracuse, Miami, Michigan
State, Notre Dame coming at you
week after week maybe Michelos-
en sees somethigﬁ in the future
that the fans don’t.

After two weeks of practice it
is apparent that the Panthers
have a good running game. In a
intra-squad game last Wednes-
day the C-Boys showed great
form as they racked up three

touchdowns in a brief showing.
Fullback Jim Cunningham
proved he lost none of his block-

'ing and runn—ing ability as he

sprung Bob Clemens loose for a
77-yard gallop. Cunningham, who
has been hampered by a sore foot,
should be ready for the opener.
Fall Camp a Success

Both Clemens and Fred Cox
look like two bronks in a rodeo
as they sharpen their horns for

their running attack. Cox also
tallied a TD in the last scrim-
~mage.

‘ The C—Boys led the Panthers
offense last year and will be
counted on heavily to carry the
load again.

Fall camp is termed as a suc-
cess according to Michelosen.
“Spirit is running high and the
boys reported for camp in good
shape,” Michelosen said. 

Cunningham Hurts Foot

“This is the ﬁrst time in re-
cent years we have trained away
from home. The food has been
good and we have been treated
well.” But Michelosen isn’t with-
out his problems. “Johnny Mike”
has had trouble ﬁelding one com-
plete first unit.

Several Panthers have been

hampered by small injuries. Cox

‘had a sprained back and Cun-
ningham’s foot is still sore.

If nothing else, his team is in
shape. The running game appears
strong, but the defense may be
lacking.

Need Tackles _

The Panthers were faced with
replacing tackles lost through

graduation. This may be more of“

an Achilles tendon than most grid
experts imagine. Michelosen re-
cognizes his lack of depth — and
has been doing his best to ﬁll the
gap with-sopohmores.

Pre-season all-American pick,
’VIike Ditka has his left end po-
sition in his’ hip pocket. The
“Hammer” looks as “strong as
ever and will lead the Panthers
as their captain. And the most
underated end last year, Ron

of sophomores, experienced

Delﬁne will take care of the
other end position.

All-East guard, Larry Vignali, ‘ I

willnail down one guard slot and

Regis Coustillac will plug up the

other. Bob Buddavich holds one
tackle slot and veteran Dick Mills
the other. Andy Kuzheski has the
center position under control and
doesn’t appear to be yielding to
any of his subs,_
Kraus at QB

One of the real surprises is at
quarterback. M a n y e x p e r ts
thought Ed Shrockman, who va-
cated the premises for one year,

would move right into the con-

trols; but Dave Kraus, who show-.
ed signs of improvement, this
spring, is holding on to the reins
of the first string.

Kraus was an understudy to
Ivan Toncic last season and saw
most of his action on defense.
Since this oﬁense game is com-
ing around the Panthers may
hold a potent one-two punch.

The Panthers schedule is as fol-
lows:

Sept. 17 U.C.L.A. (night) away
Sept. 24 Michigan State

F rosh Grid

“Let the punishment ﬁt the
crime.” '

If the author of this quote
was looking at the frosh foot-
ball team he would probably
say, “Let the material ﬁt the

need.”

There is quite a change in
Coach Bimbo Cecconi’s football
forces this season. Last year he
had what was called to be one of
the largest squads, in both size
and numbers in Panther history.

This year his team seems to be
small in both categories. Yet, it
was planned this way. The
Panthers were blest last year
with outstanding linemen. This
year the need seemed to be for
fast backs.

When recruiting time rolled
around the Panthers picked up
players that would ﬁll what would
seem to be a need in the future.

What kind of material Cecconi
will have this year is still a ques-
tion. After only having three days’
of practice the coaches have had
little time to do more than put
the players in positions.

From 36 prospects there are
only 12 linemen. ‘Even these 12
linemen are not big, but speed
and strength could be in the
characteristics. In another two
weeks the “little” Panthers
should be rounding into shape.

By then Cecconi and his as»
sistant coaches, Bob Pollack, Billf
Kaliden, and Joe Pullekines‘
should have some idea of how
his “little bandits” should fare. I

Looks Bright For
Fall Trimester

Sports Editor

  

IIIIIIIIIIIIIICIIIIIIIIIIIIIIUIIII‘

 

Now that registration is over and everything has settled
down to normal, its time to take abrief look at the sport scene
that will be used to brighten the student’s campus life.

And “brightens” is the word I mean as two of the three
fall sport coaches are talking about banner years for their
squads, and the third one (a guy who never talks about
banner years) is moaning about the schedule with a loaf of
bread under each arm.

CoachiCarl Rees and Leo Bemis, who guide our cross-
country and soccer teams respectively, are both praising
their Sophomdres and are looking forward to good years.

Rees will have four second year men whom he is de-
pending upon, and if a couple of the upper classmen can
come through, then look out for the harriers.

Bemis, who has two all—American candidates in Corky
Cuthbert and Zeke Zanicopolous, will be facing the toughest
schedule a Panther soccer team has ever met, but Bemis
doesn’t seem to be too worried. He also is depending on
sophomores.

The fellow with a loaf of bread under his arm is none
other than John Michelosen who will be entering his sixth
year as Panther head tutor. T Johnny is known forhis lack

, of optimism, but if lastyear is any indication the Panthers

should be right up there among the nation’s powers.

The Cats have three all-American candidates in Mike
Ditka, Larry Vagnali and Jim Cunningham. Bob
Clemens has also received mention on several of the pre-
season teams. '

While the harriers havebeen working out with just a
few of the local squad members and the booters starting
practice only last week, the football team has jumped off to a
fast start and has been going through heavy drills for two
weeks. They already have several full scale scrimmages
under their belt. -

This early start by the Panthers may make a diﬁerence
in their first game,

If the gridders can get off to a good start against U. C.
L. A. a week from Saturday, and Coaches Rees and Bemis
are right in their pre—sea-son optimism then We can all sit
back and watch our local heroes pull in victory" after victory.
It all should add up to be quite an interesting year. Sports-
wise, that is.

HERE IS A close-up of all-American End Mike Ditka as he gets
one of his rare minutes of rest on the bench in one of last years
games. The “Hammer,” as he has been nicknamed, has been
picked on every pre-season all-American team. If they didn’t
pick him for the starting eleven, then he was selected for the second
team. Panther fans wﬂl get lots of ‘thrills as Ditka cleans up
Chem! backs this year. A . '

Coach Leol/iemis Optimistic
As Soccer Eleven Readies

Seven Lettermen
Return Headed By

Zeke Zanicopolous

The Panther soccer team,
like their football cousins,

face what is perhaps the
iroughest schedule in the
T country, but Coach Leo

Bemis expects to ﬁeld a team
equal to the schedule.

With the return of All—Ameri—
can candidate George “Zeke”
Zanicopolous at goalie and high-
scoring Bob “Corky” Cuthbert
taking over at center forward,
the squad looks like a sure threat
to any opponent.

Seven lettermenxand a group of
promising sophomores ‘up from
last year’s freshman team bolster
Bemis’ hopes for a good year.

C0-Captains Loss

Cal Smith, a big center fullback,
will be the mainstay of the de-
fense. Loss of‘ 1959's co-captains,
Ron Wyatt and Ron Podmilsak,
at the wing fullback spots will be

A
V

the chief problem of this 1960
team.

Pete Smith, a sophomore from
Ireland, will be a surprise to the
booter’s foes who have not seen
this fancy ball handling line-'
man in action. Bemis feels,
“With Smith and Cuthbert we
should have the ﬁnest one-two
punch in the nation.”

Paul Liberati, an experienced
utility man, can be played either
on the line or as a fullback. This
versatile sophomore plays the
brand of hustling ball that Coach
Bemis expects to be the trade-
_mark of the 1960 booters.

Bemis Stresses Offense A

Valuable men, like Ed Weih-
rauch, Bob McNulty, Ron Prado,
Steve Daniels and Bob Fiedler,
were all starters last year and
should see plenty of action this
season.

The unusual aspect of 1960 is
that for the first time the Cat
soccer team has a terriﬁc of-
fense, while the defense remains
the question mark. Defense had
always been the Panther watch-
word in previous seasons.
