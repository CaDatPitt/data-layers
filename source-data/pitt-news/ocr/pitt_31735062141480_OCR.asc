year at Pitt and that stricter scholas-

ltic reduire-melits are demanded by

the faculty, "whereas some of our com-

. petitors have not _ kept ap‘ac.e with

‘us in this respect. The one-year resi-

‘ deuce rule, and the three year rule,

which are strictly‘ adhered to_at— Pitt

v ‘are on1y,li—ved' up .to by»fou1' schools

on the Panther,192'2.sched'ule, namely
Cin-c_inna.t_i, Syracuse, Pennsylvania
and Penn. State. The otherschools
permit Freshmen to play, and teams
can ‘easily be bolstered up’ each year‘
im that way,'"whe~reas we must de-
pend on the men who have been in
school one. year. This is not .ar_l*alibi,
‘but’ merely a statement of facts.
A " ’Var'sity Hard. Hit.

.,It is also true that the Pitt team
was hit harder. than any team in the
country as rega.rds gralluation and in-
eiligi-bi1ity_ of" men. Off the 37 men
on the squad! last year, ‘but 15 are
memlbers this year, and here, are
some of the s't.ars-"who were lost:
Center, Herb Stein; Tackle, Harvey
Harman; Halfback, Tom Davies;
Guards, Fred Peters. and John Mc-
Lean; Tackle, Leon Kelley; End,
Fred Ewing and" others. When this
‘number of experienced -men are taken
from a team‘, it ‘takes a little-time
-to develop men fdr their places. Even
i-f"tl1'ey have had a year’s experience
on the Freshman team, -certainly such
a team cannot be expected to show
mid‘-season form againstveteran out-
ﬁts SU.C4h as -we met in Welst-Nirginia
and Lafayette- Neither*-of -1 these
teams lost more than two or three
men and they had equally as ‘good
men avaliable in the Freshman class.

_ West Virginia will put in the one-

year residence rule next year, _and it
is hoped that Lafayette» will do like-
wise.

Syracuse _ Game.

With these two games over, atten-

’ tion now. turns to the Syracuse game

Saturday.‘ This will be a terriﬁc bat-
tle and Pitt will have- to show every-
thing in its rope-rtoire— to will. Syra-
cuse was taken off its guard last
year and literally rushed off‘ its feet.
The team was there, but it could not
get going against the Panthers. This
"yiear “revenge” is all they talk about
up at the Salt City}, and they are
going to be a bunch of. ﬁghters
against the Panthers. Quite a. few
alumni and students will see the
game. Tllose who desire to make
reservations through the Graduate
Manager should communicate with
him at once.'The team leaves Friday
morning and will stay over night at
Rochester, going to Syracuse Satur-
day TYl0Tnin.9:. S'y1'acuse headquarters
will be at the Hotel Onondaga.

The Bucknell game is the next
home ga»n1e,"and. it will be equally
as hard as VVest Virginia and La-
fayette. Bucknell a.ln1os»_t tied the
great Naval Academy team Saturday,
and is very strong. The Buckner]
alumni will be out in force for this
"game, andare planning a’_hig alumni
_get-together. The alumni sale for Pitt
men is almost as heavy as for La-
fayette" and West Virginia.

Wh‘en a boy eiit"ers= the ‘University
of . Pittsburgh. "he ymeets a theory

The theory is that ,work,, study, and
-drudgery are no longer‘ an obligation,
but an opportunity. The Freshman
girl "meets the same "t"-heory. "" 

» In the transition from the high
school to the. University" freedom
suddenly arrives; and freedom proves‘
to be a."‘ confusing thing. The ‘child’s_

The making» of new friends is a de-
light, a beneﬁt, and a distraction.
And. then, to add to the: confusion,
the entire University. seems to say to
the boy.o_r" girl: “Whims and indo-
lence are no good here; bolstering is
no good." You must -have intelligence
enough to know what .you want and
cha.ra.cte-r enough to work and work‘
a.nd work to get what you want,
otherwise the University is not the
"place. for‘ you.”

‘toward their chosen mark, ‘, ‘
~'I‘h’i‘s enthusiasm is the stuff" of
which nsu-ccess is made-. B-ut if it is
allowed to -run sheer. into technical
-training from the‘. start, it leads. to
mediocrity and disappointment. The
reason is that the practice of a pro-
fession, is not a.n..~orderly affair like
.a.. recitation. Its limits are not mark-
ed. lt fuses into the motive force
of the community. The "-boy, for ex-
ample, who Would find in engineering
the means to make the. most of him-
self__ must" grasp more "than the ap-
plication. of .".physics,"_ chemistry, and
mathematics. He must be part of
the motive force of hVi_s‘:co-mmunity.
He must enter into vital relations
with his fellows; he mustgras-p with
"intelligence,‘_ speed, and
the point of vie-w of his? fellows. He
must share theirylives and lead them
to share the good in his. In order
to enter into this contact, then, he
mu-stknow more than technical engi-
neering.‘ ‘He needs the fundamental
facts of economics, government, and
biology; and he needs-literature and
language. What he needs is some-

times described by. the word culture. ‘

THE DIAL will publish, in itsissues from October to March

MANY MARRIAGES

a new novel by,

I Sherwood Anderson

Mr Anderson is the most interesting and important ﬁgure in

contempormy American letters.

I . ago, Mr Anderson has published six books, each of which
' ~ has marked :1 distinct growth in this development.
work to be published in book form is The Triumph, of the
Egg, a collection of his-best short stones. This was probably
the most seriously discussedbook of the past year.

MANY MARRIAGES, his Iatestnot-el, both in theme and
treatment, stands far apart from the run, of novels dealing
with the American scene. The conﬁdent belief held by
American and foreign critics in Mr Ande1son’s future will"
» be justiﬁed by this new novel, for in it he has gone farther
than in any previous work in the full development of his -
art. A man living in a small town in the State of Wis-
consin is the central character of this signiﬁcantwork. It is
the story of -the love and marriage of a man, told as the man
* pd understands it on the decisive night when the marriage
comes to an end. The intensity ofcmotion and the richness
of imagination are equally remarkable.
a distinct bredk from the methods of photographic realism
so much in vogue among writers of the middle west. It is , . ~
the most important work that Mr Anderson . has produced , ,
so far, and is certain to be acclaimed by the discriminating
as a permanent contribution to American letters.

THE DIAL wishes to assure the admirers of.M'r Anderson's
 work that Many Marriages surpasses anything he has pre-
. viously written. It is probable that this novel will be the

literary sensation of the coming season. We feel certain

that you will not want to miss this ﬁne work. _ '

The Pitt football schedule is dev-
eloping. into‘ one hard.» game -after an-
other. Last week it -was West ‘Vir-
ginia, the week before it was: Lafay-

strong Syracuse team at ‘the Salt City.

A veteran team awaits Pitt which
well remembers‘ the sound thrashing
it received‘ at the hands of Pitt last
year and they are silently awaiting
itheirt_‘revenge, ,w_hich according. to
them‘is_ to come in sweet portions
next Saturday. Coach Meehan has
‘beenaiming at this game and he has
been -pushing his‘ team to their best‘
for the -battle. Syracuse has met
Pitt 5 times, of these they have won
‘and tied 1, while Pitt has won the
-remaing‘ ‘three. Last year’s game
was a victory for Pitt to the tune of
35 to 02 This year Pitt expects no
such results, and they know whatrit
is going to take to bring home _a win.

Syracuse has most of its last year's
team «back. Besides these they have
some oi?‘ 1astlyear’s Fresh team that
are read stars. Bill Kellogg and Pete
MacRae plays end, and Kellogg half.
and last year’s Syracuse mainstays
are playing at the top of their game.
»MacRae plays end, and Kellokk half;
Zimmerman is also far above his last
year's game and will cause -trouble.
V-an 7Blarcon, 221 lb. "tackle, who
stands 6 ‘ft. 2 in. is -a human batter-
ing ram. Stenin, guard, weighs 200lbs.
Vincett weighs 211. lbs. and is 6 ft.
.1 in. Starrobin weighs 2&0«0 lbs. and
stands 5 ft. 11.in. Reinhart weighs
205 lbs. and stands 6 ft. Japp and
VValdo=rf, both veterans, are playing
their positions in. line style.

The new men that areattracting
attention. are Simons, from Univers-
ity oil? Chicago, who is playing half,
and is reputed‘ to be one of the sen-
sations of the east this year. McBride,
ate-am mate‘ of Marsh Johnstown from
Bellefonte Academy, is also a star.
He and Simmons were the bulwark of
the Orange Freshmen last year.

Great preparations are being made
to receive the Pittsburgh visitors.
All Syracuse. is planning to attend.
The whole town is in back of the
their home lot.‘ ‘Such is the problem
that Coach Warner and his boys have
on hand. - '
