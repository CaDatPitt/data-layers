Adrienne Long discovered while working in
Africa as a member of the Peace Corps that
having access to a bathroom made only out
of reeds meant she could only bathe at night
and not during a full moon. This is just one
challenge that Pitt students have experienced
while serving in the Peace Corps.

As one of the major international ser-
vice organizations in the United States, the
Peace Corps sends citizens abroad to serve
and improve others’ lives. As the organiza-
tion’s website states, participants return with
knowledge and skills that help to enrich their
own communities and lives. It currently has

7,209 members and 65 host countries.

The Peace Corps recently released the
rankings for top Peace Corps volunteer-pro-
ducing universities (separated by various cat-
egories), and Pitt — which has 13 graduate
alumni serving in the corps globally —— ranked
ﬁfth among U.S. graduate schools. ~

Long is just one of Pitt’s graduate students
pursuing a master’s degree in public health
who served in the Peace Corps. She volun-
teered in Mozambique for two years through
her Peace Corps Master’s International Pro-
gram with the School of Public Health.

While this may seem like nonsense to

just a typical Wednesday-rrifght practice. The

 

Banshees, Pittsburgh’s female Gaelic football
team, alongwith the Celtics, Pittsburgh’s male
team, continue the tradition of the old Irish
sport by competing nationally and spreading
its inﬂuence.

“We’re always recruiting,” Dillaman, who
graduated from Pitt in 2004 with a degree in
psychology, said. “A lot of itisword of mouth,
and some ofthe team is from Ireland, came to
Pittsburgh and then sought outateam to join.”

relatively unknown to a majority of Ameri-
cans, the sport is still Ireland’s most popular
in terms of attendance. '

Players can carry the ball, shaped similarly
to a soccer ball, for four steps before he or
she must either hand—pass it to a teammate
— by striking the ball with one’s hand —- or
soloing it, in which the player must drop the
ball and kick it back up to themselves. Play-
ers can score by either kicking the ball into a
soccer-style’ goal for three points, or punting
it over afootball—style goalpost fotone point.

“It’s non-stop action,” Dillaman, who plays
full forward for the team, said. “In American
football, you get a bunch of little bursts, but
with Gaelic football it’s exciting all the time.”

Gaelic football is just one of several sports
underthe Pittsburgh Gaelic Athletic Associa-
tion, which promotes Gaelic sports in the area.
It holds events such as the one at the Pitts-
burgh St. Patrick’s Day Parade, season kick-off
parties and team reunions at Irish pubs.

Long said the most touching experience
during her time in the Peace Corps was the
relationship she formed with her next—door
neighbors, an older and a middle-aged wom-
an whom she called “grandma” and “aun ”

“They thought it was fascinating that I
didn’t have a husband or children and I was
in school,” Long said. “Just the process of me
learning from them and them learning from

John Connolly, the Banshees’ coach, said
that in its 11 years, the women’s team has expe-
rienced great growth, leading to a ‘B’ division
championship last year over‘San Diego.
When a team wins the ‘B’ division cham-
pionship, it automatically moves up to the
‘A’ division, which has stronger opponents
and provides more competition. The Gaelic

Affairs, is currently serving as an education
volunteer in 'I‘ulu Bolo, Ethiopia.

After a year in the Peace Corps, McShane
said she appreciates how her graduate educa-
tion prepared her for time abroad.

“The impact of GSPIA on transitioningto
my service in Ethiopia wasn’t noticeable at
ﬁrst. But now that I have been here for nearly
eight months, I have been able to reﬂect onthe
value of the courses and discussions I ha ,”
Mcshane said.

She has applied lessons ﬁ'om the class-
room to her experience abroad.

“I can see that my academic experience
gives me an advantage inhowl conduct myself
as a volunteer in that I try to be very consci-
entious of the many underlying factors that
make my service frustrating or puzzling,”
she said.

Saftner worked as a science education
volunteer and taught physics to high school
students. He also focused on improving sani-
tation and providing students with drinkable
water.

Saﬁner dealt with some misconceptions
about Americans held by locals while working
in Cameroon. ,

“A lot of people think you have traditional
healing powers, like you have the cure for
AIDS. They think you can cure them by just
speaking to them,” he said.

For Saftner, his greatest achievementwas

bringingawell to the schoolwhere he worked.
Previously, students either drank from the

hours and ended up faintingfrom dehydration
during the day. ‘

Sara Goodkind, aprofessorinPitt’s School

of Social Work, taught English in Romania

“They realize it is going to take a lot of work
to compete in the A’ division next year, but
they are willing to go all in.”

While Connolly did not come on as head
coach until this year after the Banshees won
the championship, he has an extensive back-
ground in Gaelic football. "

“Personally, I have been involved with
Gaelic football for 20 years as a player and
a coach,” he said. “It is a big part of my life.
My wife was one of the original members to
start the women’s team, so I’ve been around
the Banshees since they started.”

Marie Young teaches an Irish language
class at Pitt and, like Connolly, has been
around the’Banshees since the team ﬁrst
started. Her husband, John Young, helped
found the team in 2003, and she has served
various roles on the PGAA.

‘ “There is a great spirit among the teams,”
Young said. “Seeing the American athletes

come in and pick up the game is amazing ,

Like many players on the team, Young
has an Irish background, and she moved to

PEACE CORPS

temational Affairs participates in the Peace
Corps’ Maste'r’s International Program, which
allows students to pursue their master’s in
foreign affairs and receive credit for serving
with the Peace Corps. The school signed the

. agreement for the program with the Peace
Corps in 2611, according to GSPIA counselor

Elizabeth McCabe, and began accepting stu-
dents for the program last spring.

McCabe said the program has beneﬁts
for both students and the country they’re

serving in.

“It allows students to apply the skills they
are gaining in the classroom to make a dif-
ference in developing countries. In addition,
students earn course credit and ﬁllﬁll the in-
ternship requirement through service with
the [corps],” McCabe said in an email.

GSPIA also works to encourage gradual
ates to pursue a job with the Peace Corps by
offering tuition scholarships to returning
volunteers. V

“It helps them to build their resume with
related work experience and develop abetter
understanding of the type ofcareer they want
to seek after graduation,” McCabe said. I '

COLUMN

Looking to improve your romantic life?
Drop the ‘I don’t care’ act

Channing Kaiser
Columnist

- I never thought I’d say this, but re-

/cently I read an article published in
Cosmopolitan thatwasvery thought
provoking. Shocking, right? Cosmo
articles are usually jokes at best and
degrading at their worst, so when
my friend sent me a link and I saw
the website URL, I had low expec-
tations.

The article, “Why Is College Dat-
ing _So Screwed Up?’ by Charlotte Li-
eberman, examines supposed root
problems of contemporary college
relationships (ex: hookup culture,
ﬂuidsexuality, etc.) and shares a
multitude of anecdotes that detail
people’s failed experiences in the
college dating arena.

_ The section that struck a chord
with me the most was about how
our ‘generation is obsessed with
pretending that we don’t care.

It’s true. Think about it: How
many times have you looked at a

a Facebook or text message and

purposefully waited a set amount
of time before responding? How
many times have you not texted a
person out of the fear of commit-
ting the social faux-pas of double
texting or not initiated a date or
get-together because you already
initiated the last one?

True, there is a line between
caring and stalking, but in general,
we’re a generation that’s scared to
show affection.

We’re scared to demand more of
our partner because we don’t want
to appear needy or whiny. We avoid
putting exclamation points in our
texts because we don’t want to seem
overeager. We settle for casual rela-
tionships when we want something
committed because this is college
andthose types of relationships run
rampant. We actlike itis OKwhena
guy responds with one word to our
two paragraphs because we don’t
want to fall into that crazy, over-
emotional girl stereotype.

We’re scared to show we care,
and that’s a problem.

Granted, this isn’t an issue for ev-
eryone — some people rock casual,

V minimal—contact relationships -

but I’ve received enough frustrated
messages from friends to know that
it is not an isolated problem.

I think hookup culture and ca-
sual relationships can be liberat-
ing and fun when both parties are
on board with the idea, but I also
think they can be frustrating and
upsetting when you’re consistently
settling for less even though you
want more.

Apathy has been an issue for me
in several relationships. I consis-
tently felt like I was putting myself
out there and then getting rejected
by, “Cool. Sounds like ﬁm,” and,
“Whatever, I don’t care,” texts. I
always made plans with little to no
reciprocation. Itwas exhausting try-
ing to read between the lines. Did
they like me at all? Did their outward
apathy mirror their inner feelings
toward me or were they just really

bad. at expressing themselves?

To remedy the issue, I put myself out there
even more, telling them how much I cared
and bluntly stating that to be happy, I either
needed more from them or to cut ties with
them completely. My honesty was respected
and although neither relationship worked
out long-term, knowing that our needs ul-
timately didn’t match up made the endings

that much easier.

Being honest about your emotional needs
and wants is hard -— I play out those conver-
sations in my head days, sometimes even.
weeks in advance ——- but it’s better to get
everything out in the open than to wonder if
he’s still seeing other people or if fantasizing
about spending springbreak together is only
going to lead to disappointment. Communi-
cation is important in any relationship, but
it only helps if you’re completely open with
one another.   v

In her article, Lieberman mentions our

generation’s addiction to communicating
by text. I think face-to —face communication
is always preferable, since certain things —
such as sarcasm —- are lost in translation.
But messaging is so ingrained in our culture
that we haw,/e to ﬁnd a‘ way to make it work in
relationships. Be straightforward about what
you want and expect. We need to stop waiting
by our phones for our partners to text us back
and getting upset with their monosyllabic
‘answers; Texting isn’t the pitfall of contempo-
rary relationships. The pitfall is that we often

I agree with Lieberman: I think that cam-
pus dating culture is broken and that the root
problem is communication. We no longer
know how to express ourselves, or at least
are unwilling to show how much we care and

to make ourselves Vulnerable. Opening up to '

someone is terrifying, but it’s only through
honesty with ourselves and others that any
lasting relationship can be formed. If hookup
culture works for you, that’s great, but if you
want something more, you can’t be afraid to
put yourself out there and ask. I

Pitt breezes
past Colorado

with swarming

defense in
Round of 64

' Tyler Pecyna
Asszktant Sports Editor

Pitt’s ﬁrst game of the NCAA Tourna-
ment was just 12, minutes old, but the
situation in which Colorado forward
XavierJohnson was caught had proven a
guaranteed advantage for the Panthers.

Johnson was trapped with the'ball in
the corner closest to Pitt’s bench, ﬁrst

guarded by freshman forward Michael ‘

Young. Then, 6-foot-9 senior center Tal-
ib Zanna rushed over to flank Johnson.
James Robinson and Lamar Patterson
stood behind them at different angles,
each sealing off a passing lane.

Josh Newkirk crouched in the post
while trying to fend off a biggeriplayer.
It would’ve been a clear mismatch had
Johnson had the space or time to look
past the swarm of Pitt defenders.

All afternoon, Pitt employed a stout
defense and converted the effort into
an easy, fast-break offense to stake a
huge lead early, continuing the intensity
throughout a 77-48 Victory over eighth-
seeded Colorado on Thursday at the
Amway Center in Orlando, Fla.

The Panthers, seeded ninth in the
south region, will advance to face Flori-
da —— the top-ranked team in the regular
season and NCAA Tournament —— on
Saturday in the round of32 in Orlando.

Pitt’s 46-18 lead at halftime nearly
matched the 46 points it scored in total

Panthers look

for all-around
effort, entertain
Duke in first
ACC home tilt

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt baseball has struggled early in its
first season as a member of the Atlantic
Coast Conference, losing ﬁve of its first
six games. After the Panthers notched
wins in their ﬁrst home games of the
season on Tuesday and Wednesday, they
look to carry that momentum into this
weekend’s series against Duke.

For the Panthers (9-10, 1-5 ACC) to
win against the Blue Devils (14—7, 4-2
ACC) this weekend, the scheme is a sim-
ple one from head coach Joe Jordano’s
perspective.

“We have to pitch well, we have to
minimize opportunities for our oppo-

nent, we have to play clean defensively.

and we have to have great situational
at-bats,”Jordano said. “When we do that,
we’re a pretty good team. When we don’t,
we can be beat by anyone.”

Steven Shelinsky Jr. has been one
of Pitt’s best situational hitters of late,
batting .500 with 13 RBIs in his last six
games. He acknowledges that the Pan-
thers have to consistently “put a full game
together” in relation to the aspects listed
byJordano.

“We’ve had games where the hitting’s
on, the pitching’s off, or the pitching’s
on, our hitting’s not there,” Shelinsky
said. “Just getting everything to click as
a team is the biggest thing right now.”

The problem is the Panthers haven’t
been able to do the things that make

them a pretty good team, and that’s start-
ing to worry their head coach 19 games into
the season.
“When they keep coming up, to me, that’s
a little bit of a lack of concentration and fo-
cus and, you know, we can’t have that,”]or—
dano said. “Especially, again, in this league
when you’re playing such great teams every
weekend, the margin of error is so slim.”
The margin of error gets no wider this
weekend with Duke visiting the Panthers
— the Blue Devils have won seven of their
last eight games. On the mound, Pitt will
send Rhys Aldenhoven, Joe Harvey and
Matt Wotherspoon to start the series’ three
games. Duke’s rotation has yet to be an-
nounced.
Senior outﬁelder Casey Roche under-
stands his coach’s concern with the team’s
mental state so far, but also said the Pan-
thers are still working on incorporating 
new pieces to the team at a point relatively A  7 I T i _  _ . V . .

, Coach Jamie Dixon doesn’t seem to
T care how the team competes, but he does
notice the improvement.

“We’re a better’ team now than we were
earlier in the year,” Dixon said. “That’s
what you hope to be.” ‘

Colorado‘(23—12) committed 17 turn-
overs, while Pitt coughed up the ball just

1 three times. The Panthers (26-9) forced
I four turnovers in the first 6:19, which
contributed to a 13-0 lead in that time.

Their stingy defense held the Buffa-
loes to just a 35.7 percent success rate

g " from the ﬁeld, while the Panthers’ offense

‘T 1 disparate ﬁgures tell a story of complete

Pitt shot a remarkably efﬁcient 62.1

i “We’re nowhere near our peak, at all,”
T Roche said. “Not even close to our peak.
Just to keep building and keep taking
those steps forward without taking any
steps back is really what we’re trying to
‘ do.” ‘,
A big stepin reaching that goal comes
i from playing what Roche calls “mistake-
, free baseball” to finish games. _
V “Because we’ve had leads in a good
amount of ACC games and we haven’t won
’em,” he said.
To take that step,]ordano says his team

frustrated Colorado defense.

Zanna led the charge with 18 points
on 6-of-7 shooting from the ﬁeld and
6—of-6 free throw shooting. Zanna also
had five rebounds, one steal and two
blocks. Zanna had scored 16 points in
the first halfand did not take a shot-in
the second. ._

“I was just trying to be patient,” Zan-
na said; “I know if I’m open, the ball is

going to come to me. I was wide open
just trying to run the floor, and I was
just having wide—open layups.”

There were plenty of wide—open
looks to go around.

There was one opportunity shortly
afterjohnson was flustered in the cor-
ner and eventually stripped of the ball
by Young. The ball bounced to Robin-
son, who quickly turned around and
led a brigade of ﬁve Panthers down the
court.

Robinson found Newkirk, who was
the farthest from the point of transi-
tion from defense to offense, dashing
through the paint on his way to a layup.

It was a scene that kept repeating

all afternoon — the only differences
were who started the play and who ﬁn-
ished it.

Pitt built its stable lead on a 12-2
advantage in points scored off turnovers
in the first half

Each of Pitt’s starters recorded a
steal, with Robinson andshooting guard
Cameron Wright registering three each.
Robinson also chipped ineight assists,
six rebounds and just one turnover.

The Panthers’ offense showed bal-
ance that came as a result of transition
offense and players who were down-
court to finish a fast break. Wright (11
points) and-Patterson (10 points) were
the only other Panthers to reach double
figures in scoring.

The lead grew as large as 32 points,
which happened twice at different
points ofthe second half.

What resulted was the largest vic-
tory ofa nine seed over an eight seed in
tournament history, somethingjohnson
said he feels weighing on him —— kind
of like the pressure applied by Pitt’s
defense throughout the game.

“They came out from the start and
got on us early and we weren’t able to
recover,” he said. “No one wants to go
out like that, so it hurts.” I
