‘SUBVERSlVES’r

FBI agents 1nade_a clean sweep of a ‘subversive cell’ composed of Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh students tonight in a cleverly staged raid at the V/Vebster

All the students nabbed were staff members of The Pitt News. All denied
their guilt. All were convicted.

Kingpin of the cell was the areh- traitor, Edward Jensen. Jensen, slander-
er of Gen. Douglas MacArthur and noted attacker of the American. Legion, loud-
lv maintained his innocence. He is to be d.eported to Sweden.

‘Not Communist ’——Markowitz

V

gs Exposed

News of an impending raid on a den of dope peddlers
leaked out today when it was learned that Colonel Larry
Maloney and his raiders were holding secret council in a

first ﬂoor ofﬁce of the Cathedral.

Reliable reports indicate that
the raid will take place around
6:30 this evening at a prominent
Oakland establishment.

For years the place has been
posing as a respectable hotel, and
only recently was it discovered
to be a “house.”

Police believe the proprietor of
the house to be R. David Kovar,
an ex-convict with a string of of-
fenses ranging from libel and
slander to assault and battery of
his co—workers.

Kovar is also presumed to be
the head of the dope outfits oper-
ating under the false front of the
Pitt News, of which he was editor.

Others supposedly connected
with the ring are: Willis “Will”
Doerge, ex-sports editor of the
News; Reva Parish, former bur-
lesque queen; and Carol “ueenie”
Frownfelter, pseudo—movie star
and fashion expert, who also ap-
peared, on the News Staff.

From a reliable source comes the
information that these four con-
spiirators have been attending the
University of Pittsburgh as regu-
lar students in order to conceal
their undercover work.

The raid tonight is planned to
coincide with a banquet given in
“honor” of these people who are

  Let 'em Eat Steak!

Gaunt, Navy-bound Bob New-
comer (see PEOPLE) leaned back
in his polished mahogany ‘chair
oneday last month and, digging a
few more gouges in the seat with
his hipbones, said,

“I’m hungry.”

Object of his remark, gaunt, in-
fantry-bound Dick Kovar, (see
MILITARY AFFAIRS) l e a n e d

digging a few more gouges in the
back with his shoulder blades. re-
plied,

“Me too.” ‘

Tonight, 67 eat steak.

And it was out of that historic

meeting of the best brains (see
FOOD) the Pitt (see EDUCA-
TION) News (see PRESS) can
produce (see AGRICULTURE)
that tonight’s equally historic
meeting of jaws evolved.

Not alone were bust connosouer

Kovar in their desire for something
to sink their teeth into. Beyond
the pine-panelled portal of the
Pitt News inner sanctum sat sixty
slavering scribes, driven to des-
peration by the semester-long
shaving of already slim swindle
sheets.

Gaunt, administration-attacking
Kovar gazed from the depths of

his gouged backed chair at the
hungry horde held in leash only
by the soft-toned sybillance of his
hyperthyroid throat and murmur-
ed,

graduating from Pitt next week.

The banquet will be allowed to
begin in order to catch the entire
ring which is supposed to number
in the neighborhood of 75 persons,
mostly students at Pitt and mem-
bers of the News staff.

In planning the coup, Maloney
stated, “This will be the end of one
of the worst rings in Pittsburgh.”

Robbery Solved

It has been a year since the
great Million Dollar Robbery took
place. Up to this time the seniors
on the Pitt News Business Staff
have kept their crime a deep, dark
secret. Now, the solution to the
great mystery is brought to the
attention of the millions of Pitt
News rreaders.

O’Brien and Sim o n (they
rhyme) engineered the plot months
before it took place. O‘Brien work-
ed as a janitor in the great vaults
and got in the habit of picking up
the extra money lying around.
Simon drove an armored car and
also picked up loose change.

Once their plan was formulated,
they needed some accomplices to
carry it out. “Who,” they asked,
“should we get to help us?” Since
the haul would be over $1,000,-
000.00 they had a perplexing prob-
lem—-What to do with the lucre
once it was ﬁlched?

The obvious need was for a cir-
culation staff. Berney, Fishter, and
Pohl volunteered to assist without
I333’-

No Hitches

All ﬁve put their hearts and
souls into the job. Berney borrow-
ed ﬁve navy pea coats from the
local Surplus Store's-window. Pohl
put some gas into his new Plym-
outh for the get—away. Fishter
borrowed some extra strong cord
from the News orilce to bind up
the guards and to tie the sacks of
money.

The job came off without a hitch
(in a literal sense). No one knew
the full story until the inquiring
reporter found out that O’Brien
was getting married on Saturday.
Putting 500,000 and 500,000 to-
gether, it was obvious the boy was
getting his money for marriage
from somewhere. Tl‘.-u:-'—the ex-
pose of the million dollar rob-
bery.

‘Not Warmonger’-——Kulamer 
John Kulamer, warmongering "
copy editor, was condemned for 5
his vicious articles proposing mass
conscription of college students.
He was pushed from a third floor
window, screaming his innocence.
David Winter, fronting as asso-
ciate editor, was first charged and ,
convicted of international con- _
spiracy to bring the nation under .
papal domination, then was re-
manded to military authorities for
a general court —marshall on
charges of seditious writings ._..
against the armed forces of the -
United States, as well as gross in-
subordination. He, too, loudly pro-
tested innocence.
‘Not Anarchist’—Knoerdel ,
The infamous anarchist, Art Ed-
itor Frank Knoerdel, was convict-
ed on sixteen counts, including
several counts of pornography, in-
citing to riot, and criticism of es-

  

 

 
 

tablished authority. The arch-
anarchist brazenly pleaded not
guilty to all charges in spite

damning of evidence presented in
the form of editorial cartoons
from the Pitt News.

The arch-propagandist and in-‘
terstate spy, Exchange Editor Lois
Foight, was accused and convicted
of using the mails to defraud and
will be remanded to Secret Service
agents on charges of using an elab-
orate word—code to spread feminist ‘
propaganda throughout the na-
tion’s exchange column. She, like
the rest of the lying crew, pleaded
innocent.

Murdock Confesses

Last on the list was Sports Ed-
itor Don Murdock, who astounded
the witnesses and criminals alike
by confessing to the charges
against him, which were violations
of the FEPC law. Murdock readily
admitted denying sports staff po-‘
sitions to female applicants. A
verdict was held pending a psy-
chiatric investigation of the de-
praved Murdock. 0

Judged by the noted jurist and
educator, Charles B. Nutting, the
arch-fiends were accused by FBI
undercover agent Richard Kovar
and Espionage Agent Carol Frown-
felter. '

The raid was staged at the close ,
of a Pitt News banquet at which
Nutting, Kovar, and Frownfelter
were ostensibly guests, but which _
was «in reality a clever trap to
round up the arch—conspirators,
confront them with the,‘ facts
against them, and summarily con-
vict them of their crimes.

‘Times’ Scribe Says

By GENE WEINSTEIN
Staﬁ‘ Reporter

(First of a series)

 “A subtle creeping paralysis of freedom of thought and
31 speech is attacking college campuses in‘ many parts of the
 country, limiting both students and faculty in the area tra-
ditionally reserved for the free ‘exploration of knowledge
. and truth.”

. This was the conclusion reached
 the New York Times’ Kalman
 Seigel after a study of 72 major
f'colleges in the U. S.

r The survey, according to the
 Times, showed many students
 and faculty were “wary and felt

Pitt won’t have a United
Nations ﬂag before next se-
mester.

Student Federalists here
who planned to purchase a United
Nations ﬂag for the Commons
Room have shelved the idea until
next semester, according to John
Blank, president.

He reported that because
an administration tie-up has
snarled the plan, it will be
too late this semester to start
preparations, even if an ap-
proval does come through
from the chancellor’s office.
According to Blank, one of the

difﬁculties is uncertainty whether
the ﬂag will be hung in the Com-
mons Room.

Blank said that the dean of
women’s oﬂice had sent his letter
concerning th flag to the chan-
cellor’s oﬂice “with an approval
on it. . -

The chancellor’s ofﬁce reported,
however, that it has not received

State Defeats
Pitt Thinclads ,

After closing the regular
track season with a 72-59 loss
to Penn State Saturday at
the Stadium, the Pitt thin-
clads are now warming up
for the IC4A’s in New York
this weekend.

The loss to Penn State evened
up Pitt’s record at 2-2. State
pulled ahead in ‘the third event;

and, overcoming reverses in the’

ﬁeld events with strong showings
on the cinder track, they retained
the lead throughout.

Scoring ﬁrst places in every
track event except the 880 and
the low hurdles, Penn State
amassed 51 points to Pitt’s 26 in
running events. In the ﬁeld the
Panthers held a 33-21 edge.

Pitt Sweeps Discus

The outcome of -the meet was
not decided until the thirteenth
event, when, leading 57-51,‘the
Nittanies scored a clean sweep in
the two mile run. ‘

In this event State’s famed dis-
tance men, Bill and Don Ashen-
felter and John St. Clair, lined up
just before the ﬁnish-line and
broke the tape together for a
three-way tie.

Pitt sweeps in the discus and
the broad jump prevented a
State run-away. It was the sec-
ond straight sweep for Pitt’s dis-
cus team of Bob Arthurs, Tom
Dressel, and George Radosevich.

Kountz Wins Again

Johnny Kountz, pulling ahead
with a terriﬁc ﬁnal kick, posted a
victory and ﬁve points in the 880.
He was timed at 1255.7. It was
his third victory of the season.

With 440 star Dick Firsching
out with a pulled leg muscle,
Penn State easily notched ﬁrst
and second places in the 440 and
won the mile relay. Other Pitt
injuries, to sprinters Norm Kutch-
er and Don Samuels, were also
important factors in the Blue—and-
Gold setback.

Baseballers Lose

Twice at State

Penn State’s mastery over the
Pitt‘ baseballers was extended last
weekend as the Nittanies smoth-
ered the Panthers, 5-2, on Friday
and, 12-0, Saturday.

The double loss marked the
fourth straight defeat to the Nit-
tanies in two years.

Pitt hopes to get back on the
victory path Saturday when the
Panthers meet Western Reserve in
a double-header at Schenley Oval.

Once again the old Pitt nemesis
—-—lack of hitting power—plagued
Ralph Mitter1ing’s squad. Pitt’s
hitting allotment in Saturday’s 12-
0 slaughter was two singles.

Paul Lomond and Bob Russell
were charged with the two de-
feats.
