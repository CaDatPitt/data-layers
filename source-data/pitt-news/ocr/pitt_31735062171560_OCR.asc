Gregory Proclaims College
Youth The “New

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

A self-proclaimed “chocolate
covered white boy,” verbally
dancing his way through a three
hour speech-show, informed a
jammed Mosque that “you white
college kids are the new niggers
and injuns of the great white fa-
thers.”

“But this is the first time in his-
tory that the injuns have cowboys
for daddies,” quipped Dick Greg-
ory, comedian turned militant,
turned politician.

The former Presidential candi-
date who ran on the Peace and
Freedom ticket in 1968 traced a
tragi-comedy of the history of the
United States, claiming that “the
great white fathers have always
needed injuns.”

“Never before in the history of
man were there cowboys,” he
said, and the presence of cowboys
in America created a need for in-
juns. Cowboys, by their very na-
ture began killing each other off.
One day they got together in the
house of the great white father
and decided that instead of kill-
ing each other they would create
an injun.

For a long time, the blacks
played the role of both nigger and

injun. The civil rights movement
began to change that but “thanks
to Stokely and Rap, America lost
her niggers and her injuns,” he
said.

The “fathers” waited until May
4, 1970, “to get. new injuns”
proposed Gregory, referring to
the Kent State killings. “Now you
youngsters had understood Amer-
ica,” he continued, “Kent State
wouldn’t have surprised you.”

The suited speaker, who used
the ploy of spicing his speech
with humorous analogies before
socking home the point, weaved
the theme of “a sick America”
throughout his talk.”

Claiming that “mother Amer-
ica was’ sick before the ink dried
on the document” (the American
Constitution), Gregory suggested
that the prescription was inscrib-
ed in the Declaration of Indepen-
dence. Reading from that docu-
ment, he boomed “it is your duty
to destroy and abolish a govern-
ment” that does not satisfy the
need of the people.

“The only thing wrong with the
Constitution is that it has to be en-
forced,” he added.

Gregory rejected violence and
gun-wielding, however, the mod-
ern antidote to America’s social

“Had the youth in Germany
during the Third Reich been like
the youth in America today, Hitler
would have been knocked off bal-

Asked if he intends to run for

plied, “I don’t know, I haven’t de-

Gregory commented on Presi-

ful five year Grape Boycott as a
model.

He proposed, as an alternative
to violence, a national Christmas
boycott in memory of Kent State,
which would do more damage,
economically, to the power struc-
ture than a show of physical force.

“Violence is nature’s way of
telling a sick degenerate nation
that it is violating the universal
laws,” he explained. “But man
never has and never will control
a revolution because revolution is
nothing more than an extension of
evolution, a fast way of natural
changef’

Gregory mentioned hearing
cries of repression while touring
college campuses. “Repression,”
he contends, “is a basic human re-
action to fear. Fear scares the
mightiest nation in the world be-
cause it makes them think that
maybe it is not so mighty.”

Repression, however, is more
detrimental to the oppressor than
to the oppressed, be emphasized.

Causes Conﬂiet

by DANA VENTRIGLIA
Entertainment Editor

Continuance of an unauthorized
display and literature table set up
by Women Concerned for the Un-
born Child (WCUC) caused a dis-
turbance on Wednesday.

According to Marc Hiller, state-
wide co-ordinator of Environmen-
tal Action/Zero Population
Growth (EA/ZPG), the contro-
versy arose because WCUC’s pre-
sence in the lobby of D. L. Law-
rence Hall was unauthorized and,
therefore, in violation of Univer-
sity regulations.

  

Q Q"--

The group approached Joseph
Colangelo, ‘director of public re-
lations, on Wednesday afternoon
who said he saw no reason for the
group not to be allowed to pass out
their literature. The permission
was unauthorized, Hiller main-
tained, because the University
has established certain require-
ments applicable to outside
groups demanding that they have
a sponsor to sign necessary forms.

‘‘I cannot believe that anyone in
his position as a University ad-
ministrator could not be aware of
the rules and regulations govern-
ing the use of a University facil-
ity,” exclaimed Hiller, “and if he
wasn't clear on that matter it
should have been his responsibil-
ity to refer this group to some-
body who could convey the cor-
rect information.’ ’

When the group was told that
they would have to vacate the lob-

by because their presence was not

in compliance with University- I 

regulations James V. Cunning-

ham, a lecturer in the Graduate _.
School of Social Work and the hus- 5

band of one of the members of

WCUC, agreed to sign as sponsor 
of the organization. In accordance ‘or

with the rules, Dr. William" Mc-A
Colough, Dean of the School, also, 

signed said Hiller. T’ .

What disturbs Hiller is that b H,
signing, he feels that “McColough 
is officially putting his depart- 7
ment on the line as agreeing with ‘
. these women.” 

He noted that after speaking ’

with several ‘ members of ‘ the

School, many of them felt that if a 1 -. E
poll would have been taken, the .

majority of the faculty would have

been against an endorsement of 

such a program.

Hiller expressed concern over?
the possibility of the situation set- T

ting a bad example. “If this is a
precedent,”
ZPG co-ordinator, “then any fac-

ulty member with the consent of -.
the dean of that school could sanc- w

tion the presence of anybody on

campus and the University would F i

have no legal means of preventing
it if they adhered to the regula-
tions they’ve established.”

Aside for the discrepancies with ,

University rules Hiller claimed

that the information being handed ,

out by WCUC was scientifically in-

accurate and grossly misleading. 
“Any biologist will testify that 
i there was misrepresentation of
scientific data,” declared Hiller,‘-I
“Several quotations were taken-_;
fully out of context. Their infor-
mation could never stand up in as _
classroom unless the course dealt 

with morality or religion and even

that can be debated in most,

casesf’

Hiller went on to condemn the a

group for having infants present

reinforcing WCUC’s stand against ’
abortion with signs hung from r
their necks with sayings such as

“If my mother had had an abor-

tion I wouldn’t be here, I would be at 
dead.” Hiller lambasted this tech- C
nique as “pure sensationalisrii C

and tasteless emotionalism.”

New Constitution Wins

On the other hand, Lynn Alstadt of the Cominit-7

declared the, EA/ _7

“We had expected a low turnout at the polls,
Alstadt said. “We’re not sure if this is what the stu- .
dents really want.” V

The committee’s biggest complaint in the past
week has been on the Allocations Committee. “We
‘ will try to change this with a Constitutional amend:

The three-day referendum on the new Student
Government (SG) Constitution ended with the docu-
ment being approved by a vote of 515 to 258.

Seven hundred and seventy-three votes were
cast altogether.

The new Constitution, which represents over
two years of attempted change, will go into effect
immediately. The four commissioners and other

paigned in this way because the
had a chance to prepare for him.

Republicans messed up the eco-
nomy. It was an attempt to fake
the voters out. They tried to let
them think law and order was the
issue instead of bread and butter."

Gregory once noted that “youth
are the most morally committed,
dedicated group ever to exist in
this country.” Wednesday he re-

peated, “They still will decide the “The Black Panther Party is an

fate and destiny of our country.”

The comedian sees a relation-
ship between the black movement
and the youth movement. “Both of
them are fighting to change the
system, to make the system work
for all concerned.

Feminists are also involved in
the fight for what Gregory term-
ed “human dignity.” “From this
standpoint there’s no way in the
world you can say . . . they’re not
together.”

Currently, Gregory is fighting
for human dignity by serving as
the self-declared President of the
United States in exile.

“Anindependentpolitical.move- l ‘L

expression of the times,” declared
the black, leader. “They are very
important because they are feed-
ing people when the government
is unwilling. They have served
many needs in the ghettos, helping
people to solve any type of prob-
lems that might arise. People can
turn to them 24 hours a day.”

Gregory said it is the Panther-
er’s talk of self-defense that dis-
turbs people. Although he himself
does not believe in violence, he de-
fended the Panthers’ rhetoric by
declaring, “America is a violent
country.”

elected officials will not be elected until the regular

elections in January, however.

Current President Lenny Klavonic said after the
results were announced that the new Constitution is
“in the definite interests of students in eliminating
the personal appointments and political manipula-

tions of past years.”

Klavonic went on to cite ten points which he
found to be of prime importance in the new laws.
These included the four'commissioners instead of
one, a new and more fair appointment system, di-
rect election of representatives to the University
Senate Council, and standardized elections.

Other strong points cited were representation for
General Studies students, standardized terms of of-
fice, election of chairmen for academic cabinets and
standardization of such bodies, cut down of the pre-
sent 25-man Senate to a more qualified and more
uniform nine-man body, and the right of appeal to a‘

will work adequately.”

Alstadt.

Denny Concilla, another member of the commit-
tee, added in the groups defense that “we didn't put
out those leaflets to the commuters that /we were;
accused of doing!” 

There has been some speculation that the group
may try to contest the referendum, as was done in L,
the presidential elections last winter. “No,” 

“We may ask that they cross-check the ballots“
and the number of cards signed. We won’t contest
the voting, but I think there will be a discrepancy
For example, they handed Denny two ballots b
mistake when he registered to vote.”

Alstadt summarized the committee’s position 
ar-as.‘

Another important aspect of

members of EA/ZPG, to clear up

and to clear up the misue of vari-

the fact that it is easier to make

capital punishment and the war in

Some people claim that abor-

of our society believes that life be-

countered lliller. “We reckon our
age from the moment of birth and
not the moment of conception or
some other time. Even Pennsyl-

Re,qistmti()r-1 “Irrt1)ro*vie(l

by STEVE LUBETSKY

The Registrars Office has been active in introducing innovative
procedures for improvement of'undergraduate registration. Several
changes. according to Registrar Richard Allshouse. have taken place
in the past two years.

Among the most progressive of these developments is the priority
given to upperclassmen in registering for courses. “Previously. seniors
were frozen out of classes in their major areas." Allshouse remarked.
“lnevitably. they would be accommodated for anyway. which aggra-
vated the size of classes.“

Another development. Allshouse said. is the availability of time-
schedules prior to registration. “At one time. class schedules were not
accessible until registration began.“

He added, however, that “it is difficult to make the department
chairmen have the schedules ready on time. We would like to see the
schedule for the entire year available at the start of the Fall Term."

The use of a hold file. Allshouse related. in which registrations are
held pending permission slips from departments and new cards for
classes that have been reopened “makes it possible for students to be
certain that they are registered for other courses they have selected.“

Still another implementation is the Pittsburgh Council of Higher
Education IPCHEI Program. Under PCHE. students may register for
courses at any one of five local colleges and receive credit.

An innovation adopted in 1969 informs the student of the times of
final exams. “This,” Dr. Allshouse asserted, allows students to insure
that finals won’t be too close together, and possible to complete the
term earlier.”

One project still in its experimental stages is computerized regis-
tration. Fred Sehring. assistant to the Registrar. stated that the new
method comes in three phases. for which the third and "ultimate goal"
is “immediate feedback."

“The first phase was the card system.“ explained Sehring. "and
we are now at the middle phase. which combines the card and terminal
systems.“ .

Dr. Allshouse was skeptical. though. about planning schedules via
computer. insisting the computers "depersonalize." Service is our

main philosophy.“ he said. "for students are human beings."

Little Doth Sow

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

Little Fauss and Big Halsey is
an unpretentious, outdoorsy kind
of film that portrays some frivol-
ous. some revealing episodes in
the lives of a small-time hustler
and his sidekick.

The hero, or anti-hero, or_ not-
quite-anti-hero of these picares-
que meanderings is Big Halsey
Knox. Halsey, a motorcycle bum.
suffers from a most delightful dis-
ease, slumbering conscience. He
is a zestful thief, liar, con-man,
lover, leaver, tippler, and a durn—
ed good cyclist to boot. He is also,
though sometimes unaware of it,
a loser.

One of the things he has lost is
his cycling license. Apparently,
some crusty old racing official or
another suspended Halsey when
he caught him employin’ too
many, er, alcholic lubricants.
Big Halsey’s in a bind—he can‘t
race without a license, which
isn‘t so bad, but he has trouble
bedding chicks without an occa-
sional trophy to help woo them
and that is most painful.

Enter Little Fauss. (That's his
name. Little.) Little is a well-in-
tended, big-hearted doormat, easy
prey for an experienced schemer
like Halsey. Little’s dream is to
become the greatest cyclist ever;
at this point, he is the worst. He

does, however, have one great-

cycle and a lot of mechanical abil-
ity.
Halsey proposes a deal—that

they go West, where neither of
them is known, that Halsey race
masquerading as Little. using Lit-
tle‘s name, cycle, and license, and
that they split all winnings down
the middle. Little's function is to
be Halsey‘s tuner. Courting vi-
sions of racing immortality, Little
agrees.

The trip that follows opens Lit-
tle's eyes to the true nature of his
conniving buddy. Introduced to
the joys of bed and bottle by Hal-
sey and aware that he has been ex-
ploited, Little severs the partner-
ship with a vow. He will dedicate
his life to cycling alone, and out
Halsey along the way.

The transformation of Little is
slightly incredible. As the sincere
but bumbling Little, Michael J.
Pollard is superb. Once, obliging-
ly sleeping in the truck while Hal-
sey cavorted with a couple of
cycle-circuit cuties, Little was
awakened at dawn by his saddle-
sore partner, who told him to go
on in and take a turn.

Blushing crimson, Little turn-
ed down the offer, but began sidl-
ing up to the bedroom door any-
way. Suddenly, deep behind his
thick wire rims, an elfin gleam lit
up hiseyes. “Well,” he giggled
with a puckish grin, “maybe I
will take a quick peek."

Perhaps because Pollard is so
convincingly naive, he fails to
come off as the heartbreaker.
He’s just too mild-mannered in
his work, a sort of Wally Cox with
his fly open.

Robert Redford, as Halsey, ca-
vorts his way through the part,
managing somehow to charm and
frighten simultaneously. Red-
ford’s portrayal of the itenerant
swindler should advance his ask-
ing fee in Hollywood, where he is
already hot property.

Redford succeeds in imparting
a certain seriousness to the role.
In a rare moment of candor, Hal-
sey sadly summarizes his career.
Life. he warns Little, is just a sor-
did procession from one greasy
spoon to the next. In moments like
these, Halsey is keenly aware of
his failure.

And in other moments, he isn't.
There is no moral to the movie.
No banal pronouncement that the
good life is better than the bad.
Little Fauss and Big Halsey tells
a tale, or a part of a tale. with a
good deal of gentle humor. and
leaves it at that.

Your Money For Death,
  Prestige, 0r life

by DON MARBURY, Editor

Ever notice the billboards, anywhere? Or many of the public
service announcements in the newspapers, on radio or television?

. "Help Crippled Children,” “Give So More Will Live," “Muscu-
lar Dystrophy Kills,” “Contribute to the Heart Fund,” “Your Dol-
lars Can Help Feed and Clothe a Child.”

Citizens are constantly being asked to give
to worthy organizations and charities. Of course,
there is nothing wrong with this except, if you ask

I yourself, “Why do organizations concerned with
the preservation of human life have to beg for .
money, while our government simply taxes its
citizenry to implement things concerned with the
elimination of life?”

’Didn’t you ever wonder why well known 
stars have to give up some of their time to go on MARBURY
television in Telethons, to beg people——to get them to promise to con-
tribute money to combat some killing or crippling disease, yet all
the U.S. government has to do is mail us a couple of sheets of paper

a . with the letters I-R-S at the top; demanding that we give‘them a

share of our money so that they can continue to kill and cripple?

We had a man making footprints on the moon because the gov-
ernment spent our money for him to do so, while we also have a lit-
tle girl riding out to a television stage in a wheelchair to ask people
to contribute money so that she can make footprints on earth.

A young man dies in Vietnam, his body riddled with bullets be-
cause America used its money wisely and invested it in infantry
training for him, while another young man dies in his hospital bed.
his body eaten up with incurable sickness, because there is not
enough money for research.

Do we as American citizens have any say in how our money is
spent by our government? ‘

Do you want your dollars _to save someone’s life or destroy it?
Would you rather have a man on Mars, or know that your wife is not
going to die from uterine cancer.

It is fairly obvious what our government thinks is more impor-
tant; saving life or taking it away, but do we? Can‘t we see how
messed up the values are of the people who lead us.

We give the government enough‘ money to create weapons

which can destroy millions of people, yet it cannot even give medi-
cal science enough to cure one person from leukemia completely.

    

Many U.S. programs now seem more like competitions for na-
tional and international prestige rather than projects for the know-
ledge and healthy survival of man.

Doctors and researchers have made. miraculous headway into
the diseases and other hazards plaguing mankind. but can you ima-
gine where they might be, had the money for Vietnam. nuclear de-
fense, and a man on the moon been spent for medical research?

 

It would really be nice to one day be asked to “Contribute to
the Man on Mars Fund”; see a sign which says. “Monetarily Sup-
port Your Fighting Boys," and rest assured that there was money
enough to help all those Johnnies walk again. or know that there was
no need for such a thing as a Heart Fund.

Dean’s Resource Council on

by CHARLES D.
MONTGOMERY
Dean of Student Development
On Monday, Oct. 19. I receiv-
ed a delegation of several wom-
en who presented me with a set
of demands covering several as-
pects of Student Affairs. One of
these demands called for the
Dean of Student Development
and the Owl editor to issue a
joint apology for certain materi-
al appearing in the 1970 Owl

it turned out this wasn‘t neces-
sary.

Director Martin gave us the
OK to keep the Police title after
a very short discussion. but just
knowing the support was there
is very gratifying. so once again

which they deemed objection-
able.

Since it is not the proper role
for Student Affairs administra-
tors to apologize for materials
appearing in student publica-
tions I indicated that I would not
comply with this request.

Several of the demands fo-
cused on functions not included
in the Student Development
area. These were referred ‘to
Vice—Chancellor Kobosky. Ar-
rangements were made for the
women to meet with appropri-
ate members of the Student De-
velopment staff to discuss in
detail their concerns and receive
suggestions relating to the re-
mainder of the demands.

Additionally, I have submit-
ted to the directors in the Office
of Student Development an af-
firmative action program for
women.‘Briefly, the steps to be
taken are as follows: a dean's
resource council on women will
be formed.

This council will have the re-
sponsibility of advising the Dean
on a broad range of policy mat-
ters that have both direct and in-
direct influence on the lives of
women in the University. Addi-
tionally. this council will be

I remember him most as an intense human being
‘who possessed a striking humanistic naturalness. In
his company one could get filled with his realness

charged with the responsibility
of advising the Dean as to the
most effective utilization of the
talents and skills of women on
the Student Development staff.

Directors have been instruct-
ed that all Advisory, Steering,
Permanent, and ad hoc commit-
tees in the Student Development
area include women. In accor-
dance with a recent directive is-
sued by Chancellor Posvar we
are presently formulating a
statement of employment goals
for the’Department which will
indicate clearly our employment
objectives for both women and
minority groups staff.

Directors have been informed
of my personal concern that the
Office of Student Development
provide greater opportunity and
equality for women so that the
entire staff working with stu-
dents and student programs
might have additional support in

carrying out their educative and

advising functions. ,

Additionally, directors and as-
sistant directors working solely
with women’s groups such as
AWS, Panhellenic, Mortar
Board, Quax, etc., will be
charged with preparing affirma-
tive action plans for these
groups. '

by MARC HILLER
Coordinator EA-ZPG

I found out Wednesday that Universi-
ty regulations for students do not hold
true for people outside of the University.
I refer to the unrecognized group of “pro-
fessional mothers" known as Women
Concerned for the Unborn Child (WCUC) .

They moved into CF and set up an au-
thorized maternity ward without consult-
ing the chief of staff. Solicitation of the
public was made by display boards. liter-'
ature, and any and means of sensational-
ism and tasteless emotionalism includ-
ing the use of babies displaying signs such
as “if abortions were legal. I wouldn‘t
be here."

But my real concern goes beyond the
actions of these women. People will see
through the literature being passed out; it
has already been condemned on scientific
grounds by experts.

What are claimed as facts are found
to be unsubstantiated guesses. mis-
quotes. unscientific conjectures. misrep-
resentation of data, or statements totally
out of context.

Valid documented scientific informa-

tion seems to be neglected. Our at-
tempts to present an education week.
unpolitical in nature (with exception of
Monday night) were explained prior to
the week as well as to entire audience
by me on Monday night.  . 

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 

Regardless of our at-
tempts, we found un- 
derhanded attacks turn-
ing this week of infor-
mation into a political
arena. When asked who
had authorized the pre-
sence of the WCUC _
threats came left and —.
right jobs were
threatened, condemna-
tion of the University to the Chancellor
and Governor, and even inquiry by their
attorney John DeMay telling us that he
had been told that we had threatened to
bodily remove WCUC.

HILLER

Finally after William Markus. Direc-
tor of Student Activities. determined
WCUC was illegally occupying CF. the
group was asked to leave. Mrs. John V.
Cunningham. however. WCUC. convinc-
ed her husband. a lecturer in Graduate
School of Social Work. to seek authoriza-

C

 

tion for use of CF after three days of il-

legal use.

It was also interesting that by pure
coincidence WCUC campus headquarters
was on the fifth floor of Bruce Hall and
we later found that Cunninghams office
is also on the fifth floor of Bruce Hall.

Cunningham then secured the signa-
ture of Dr. William H. McCullough, Dean
of GSSW. This was all that was needed to
obtain legal entry into CF.

Does this mean. as it seems. that
GSSW is endorsing WCUC. its goals and
its activities? Why did McCullough sign
such a request that labels GSSW and fur-
thermore authorizes them to underwrite
WCUC's activities without at leastycon-
suiting the majority of his colleagues?

Above all. people contacted seemed
to feel that the majority of the people in
GSSW support liberlization of abortion
laws. We believe that this was a true in-
fringement on the rights of his col-
leagues; an action that will only create
more hostility. lack of understanding.
and above all changing an educational
program into a political circus.

The reasons remain unclear and un-
justified. McCullough was warned by Di-

 

rector of Special Programming before he 

signed and committed GSSW to back
these emotional anti-abortionists in us-
ing their extreme and unorthodox tactics.

Did he attend any of the programs
and judge them so poor that we deserved
such treatment? Could he not have at
least notified our office of his actions out
of common courtesy?

Compliments were given by peo\ple in
CAS. graduate schools. etc. on a “most
valuable. needed and well done program.
What gives him the sovereign authority.
with WCUC. to destroy this Information
Week?

Does he want God-like power to inflict
his opinions over others forcefully? Is
he afraid to let the facts reach the public?
Is he fearful, like WCUC, that people with
an open mind might disagree with him?
Must we always have untruths cluttering
the distribution of truths?

In conclusion. may I only say‘ to all
those concerned that if they want political
games. we too will play them. If they pre-
fer politics to education. what the hell.
we‘ll give them a chance to prove that

. they are better politicians than they are

educators.

 
 

 

New Ecological
Living Proposed

To the Editor and Students:

Mr. Hours comments concern-
ing the freaks sell—out to the eco-
nomic life of this country (Wed-
nesday. Nov. 4. Pitt News) were
well-put. but he had very few
practical suggestions. Let me
make a few that I am aware of.
and I‘m sure others can add to the
list.

As Mr. Hour mentioned. the
Oakland Co-op on the Blvd. of Al-
lies is a good place to shop for
clothing and some leisure items.
It is still in its beginning stages.
but it promises well. It is owned
and operated by customers like
you and me. and prices are meas-
urably lower than in stores selling
comparable items.

One of the most valuable forms
of communication the counter
culture possesses is music. There
are two major discount record
stores in Oakland. with identical
prices and selection of rock and
jazz records. One is a non-profit
“Free Peoples Store." located in
Environment Two.

Though the regular discount
store is several blocks closer to
dorm students and many apart-
ment—dwellers. the walk is well
worth the effort to patronize the
Free Peoples’ Store.

A mail order cataloge called
“The Whole Earth" is available

from time to time. and is struc-
tured similarly to a community
co—op. recommending the better
quality and less expensive prod-
ucts necessary for "ecological
living.”

One of the constructive things
the individual can do is to pool his
or her resources with a few
friends. A girl can make a shirt:
candle making is a great leisure
time activity; friends can share
cars. etc.

Thoreau makes interesting
reading concerning just how lit-
tie. in terms of money. the human
animal requires to survive with
leisure. Though it is doubtful that
we will ever attain Thoreau‘s
idealistic “nation of philosoph-
ers.“ neither need we become a
nation of gluttons.

It is my feeling that “the rev-
olution" will not be violent. Let's
face it—we‘re outnumbered at
least ten to one. with zero techno-
logy. The revolution must truly be
a radical switch in life-style.

Most urgent is this new eco-
nomic life we must lead. a major
step in ending our own and others
exploitation and psychological op-
pression which the technological
society has produced.

Dorm Facts Lack
A Good Foundaﬁon

Editor, The Pitt News:

Joe Forbes, wherever you are.
I would like to congratulate you
on perhaps the finest piece of
prose to hit the letters depart-
ment of the Pitt News this year. I
say prose because your “facts"
referring to the new dorms are
not facts.

Its amazing. Forbes. how you
can sit down (I assume you were
sitting) and write a "muck-rak-
ing“ letter without doing any re-
search. Your letter is the type of
print that really hurts those who
have legitimate cases against the
dorms. Here is how it hurts.

When someone who has not
formed an opinion yet on the con-
troversy of the new dorms reads
your letter he will most likely I)
react as if his intelligence was in-
sulted or say to himself 2) “Is
that the sort of sloganistic. nar-
row—mindedness that is against
the dorms‘? What else is wrong?"

Right now you‘re probably say-
ing. "Aha! The deadly venom that
pours from the fangs of Berger
into my holy scripture contains no
substance to counter my righteous
claims!"

You're right. I have no opinion.
But, as editor of the Owl, I am
conducting research into this
problem; research that is far
from completed. We do know.
however, that your letter. Forbes,
is all one sided. “You didn't get
the facts.”

I am not saying that the dorms
are a good idea, I am only stating
that your reasons are wrong and
you’re only hurting the cause of
those against the dorms. My ad-
vice to you? Replace some of your
emotionalism with intelligence.

The Lions have victimized Navy

Army (38-14), West Virginia
(42-8), Maryland (34-0) and Ohio
U. (32-22). Early ‘season diffi-
culties resulted in a streak-break-
ing defeat at the hands of Colorado
(41-13). Their other losses were
to Wisconsin (29-16) and Syracuse
(24-7).

Paterno attributed the Lions
problems to “lousy coaching. We
got off on the wrong foot,” he said.

Since then, State has really
come around. “Right now Penn
State is capable of playing the
same type of football they played
last year,” said Pitt’s assistant
coach Bill Quinter. “They aren’t a
great team yet, but they are cap-
able of it.”

260 plateau this evening if the
Pitt shooters hope to extend their
record to 3-1. Their foe is Carne-
gie Mellon University whose
coach, Sgt. Andy Jackson, boasts
three shooters who can consis-
tently hit the magic 260 mark.

The match is to be held tonight
at 6:30 in the Trees Hall Rifle
range. .

C-MU’s squad is probably the
largest in the area with 25 mem-
bers. Pitt, with a much larger en-
rollment, has only 15 varsity
shooters, two-thirds of whom are
newcomers with little or no ex-
perience.

Crooks is a senior majoring in
mechanical engineering and will
graduate in April. He sees to-
night's match as a possible vic-
tory.

“If we decide we want to win
we can beat them,” he said.

This will be the last match for
the Pitt shooters this year as
their nextfmatch is not slated un-
til next January. The season
which began in October consists
of 14.matches and ends in March

3 when a post seasonal tourney is

held. It is a sectional in which the
top teams in the State and the
East are invited to compete.

Leading the Lion attack will be
their seasoned backfield combina-
tion. halfback Lydell Mitchell
(120-641 yards and six TDs) and
fullback Franco Harris (125-586
yards and five TDs). At the helm
will be quarterback John Hufnag-
el. --

“They have a very efficient of-
fense,” said Quinter, “with a good
running quarterback. Their start-
ing offensive backfield does a con-
sistent job (Joel Ramich and
Fran Ganter), then they bring in
their breakaway threats——Lydell
Mitchell and Franco Harris.”

Hufnagel took over the pilot’s
job in the Army game and Penn
State hasn’t lost since. “He’s an
outstanding athlete. He runs the
option and runs it well. He’s been

_contagious for their offense; get-

ting it rolling.

The Panthers will enter tomor-
row’s traditional rivalry with a
chance to record their first win-
ning season since 1963. John Ho-
gan, who had trouble with his el-
bow Saturday has been throwing
well in practice and will probably
be ready forthe contest.

Back from injuries suffered
earlier in the season will be Ken
Shumaker, Joe Carroll, Dave Mc-
Grath and Hank Alford. McGrath
will be moved to middle-lineback-
er and concerning the switch, he
said, “You got to tackle more and
try not to get blocked.” John
Simpson suffered an ankle injury
that might prevent him from mak-
ing the trip.

“were certainly going to put it
together against Penn State,” said
Coach DePasqua.

Women’s Volleyball Team

Wins One, Loses One

During their last two games, the women’s volleyball team had both
a disappointment and a success. Last Saturday, the team beat Youngs-
town. 16-14 and 15-13. On Monday the Pitt girls lost a heart-break-

er C-MU, 10-15, 15-7, and 12-15.

The Youngstown game was the closest match the Pitt team has

seen this year. Both games were
won by only two points, the closest
margin allowed in volleyball. In
scoring for Pitt, Rose Smith had
nine points for both games and
Kathy Cassell had eight. A Pitt
player, Kathy Utz, injured her
hand in the first match and was
replaced by Pat Wallish who com-
petantly filled the space.

Concerning this game, Pitt
Coach Sandy Bullman felt that “it
was the best game we’ve played.
Youngstown has improved 100 per
cent?’

On Monday. though, the Pitt
team finlly met their match. In
all previous matches, the home
team had dispatched their oppon-
ents in just two games. The C-MU

   

match went three games with Pitt
coming out on the bottom. The fin-
al score was 10-15, 15-7 and
12-15. Coach Bullman commente

d ..
that “I thought that in the seconﬁ 3

game, we were going to come out
of it. They (C-MU) were a better
team with more consistent play.
Both teams made silly mistakes
but we made more. C-MU took ad-
vantage of each mistake we

Led by a ferocious defensive line. Kappa Sig edged l)elta Phi. 20-13.
Wednesday afternoon to cop their fraternity football division title. Del-
ta Phi had reached the playoff by defeating Theta Chi. 20-12. the night

before.

Quarterback Rege Tomsey and split end March Kranc accounted
for all the Delta Phi points in both games. Against Theta Chi. Tomsey
roamed at will. executing the option perfectly. and consistently firing

completed passes to Kranc.
Against Kappa Sig. however. it
was a different story.

Kappa Sig jumped off to a quick
12-0 advantage. QB Dave Dwor-
sky directed his team to a quick
score. hitting John Burby with a
one—yard paydirt toss. Minutes
later. Ron Ghilany snared an-
other Dworsky TD aerial.

gamely. Chuck Mikulandrich, who
also played a sparkling game at
defensive end, gathered in Tom-
sey’s 30-yard scoring bomb.

Trailing 12-6 at the start of
the second half. Delta Phi took the
lead as Krance sped 50 yards on a
punt return for a touchdown.
Kranc caught the one point PAT
pass to make the score 13-12.

With less than four minutes to
go. Kappa Sig mounted a drive.

But Delta Phi took over on downs ~

on their own three yard line. The
football game appeared to be over.

On second down, deep in his own
territory, Tomsey dropped back
into his end zone to pass. Fearful
of being trapped for a safety, he
threw the pigskin into Tom Lang’s
arms, for an interception. Seconds
later, John Burby grabbed Dwor-
sky’s game-winning pass, with the
latter scoring the two point con-
version.

Both Kappa Sig and Delta Phi
performed superbly in this ten-
sion-filled encounter. Walt Vuk-
manic and Lang were the two
Kappa Sigs most responsible for
making Tomsey to pass hurried-

ly and inaccurately time after’

time.

House with two interceptions tone for a touchdown» on defense. four TD

the second time the,Sutherlands
had the ball. Macha had intercept-
ed deep in his own territory. On
second down, he let loose with a
bomb to Dennis Hawks who went

Hello, I’m Johnny Cash.

the sound of the Hohner
harmonica.  

  
   
  
  
 

 

It's a sound that's as much a
part of America as the lonesome
wail of a freight train in the niglit.x ‘

A sound that was first heard
back in the 1830's when llohner ,
harmonicas soothed restless
. mountain men. homesick sailors
and weary plantation workers. , ‘

During the Civil War, the
’ ~ V. ~ ' _. sound was Johnny Reb playing ,

I “Dixie” at Shiloh and Lookout Mountain. While across the. lines
Union soldiers played “John Brown's Body." f

Cowboys broke the prairie stillness with Ilohners. Railroad
men kept them in their overalls as the great iron beast pushed west. _
Wichita. Pocatello. Sacramento.

The sound went with boatmen up from New Orleans.
Lumberjacks in Coos Bay. Miners in Cripple Creek. Farmers in
Dyess. the little town in Arkansas where I grew up.

I remember hearing it back then. (‘food times or bad, the
humble harmonica has been in America's hip pocket as we grew up.
And it's still there today. '
Because it’s a sound that's simple and

true. llappy and sad. A reflection ol’life,
past and present. _ .

It's not surprising that today llohners lit ,
so naturally with any kind of music. Blues, L
Folk and Rock. In fact, Ilohner makes over
160 different kinds of harmonicas. from an
inch and a half to two feet long. Popular ‘V
models come in all (lillt-rent keys. 'l‘licre's even
a neck holder so you can play harmonica and guitar at the same
time. .\lc? I use the good old .\larinc Band for songs like
“()range Blossom Special." It gives me just the sound I want.

Pure and honest.

You can get the same sound I do by _eet.ting a llolmer
harmonica l(i<l1l_\'. At your campus bookstore
or \\'llL‘I't‘\‘(’I'Il1‘11SlCZll

It's 89 ways better than a Volkswagen.
The car you see before you has almost twice
as much trunk space as the Volkswagen Beetle.
it gives you a smoother ride and a shorter turn-
ing radius than the Beetle.
It even has a longer lasting, more Powerful en-
gine than the Beetle.
All told, this car has 89 things you've never
seen inside the Beetle.
In fact, it's so superior to the Beetle, we couldn't
call it the Beetle anymore.
So we gave this car, whose mild-mannered ex-
terior masks its true identity, a new name.
We call it SUPER BEETLE.

But CUTTING - Yes! A diamond cut in proper pro-
portions shows an equal distribution of light and
brilliancy at all distances from the eyes. It retracts

the rays, which hit the diamond, back through the top.
In a poorly cut diamond, the light rays leak through.
