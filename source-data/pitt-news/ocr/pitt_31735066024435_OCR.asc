Schenley Renovation

By SUSANPECUCH

Pin News Staff Writer

The Schenley Hall renovation
may finally become a reality. The
Allegheny County commissioners,
in co-operation with Pitt officials
have created a building authority to
help Pitt finance future construction

and renovation, including Schenley'«

Hall.

The authority, the Higher Educa-
tion Assistance Authority (HEAA),
will be able to issue bonds at a lower
interest rate than that ofthe market,
allowing Pitt to construct and reno-
vate new facilities at less expense.
No burden will be placed on thetax-
payers and the people who purchase
the bonds will get a tax break. Pitt

“Reagan has done some devastat-

ing things since he’s, been in office ‘

and labor and environmental groups
have formed an alliance to streng-
then two federal laws now under
attack,” explained Bill Kane of Uni-
ted Auto Wrkers.

About 20 environmental and
labor groups met recently at the
downtown Hilton Hotel to discuss
strategies to defend and strengthen
the Occupational Safety and Health
Act and the Clean AirAct.

“Cooperation between labor and

will be required to back the bonds

and repay them in the future.

According to Jack Freeman,
Pitt's senior vice chancellor, Pitt’s
building projects are usually funded
by the Pennsylvania General State
Authority (GSA). V

“The GSA helps us with our con-
struction needs,” Freeman said, “but
it‘s difficult to rely on them. There is
no seperation between funding for
general education needs and higher
education so a lot of competition is
involved." No major funds have been
awarded to Pitt since I975 and we
have several major projects that
need to get moving. The HEAA will
be a more predictable and imme-
diate source of funds,” he said.

said Sam Hays, representative ofthe

politics professor at Pitt,-he.com- 

mented that the two have been
working together for around a
decade especially in health con-
cerned areas.

The Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) was
established as a pursuant to the
Occupational Safety and Health
Act. Its function is to conduct inves-
tigations and inspections to deter-
mine industry’s compliance with

safety and health regulations. g

The Schenley Hall renovation is
high on the administrations list of
priorities and will most likely be the

Riirst attempt at using the new
authority.

“It has taken over I2 years for us
toget moving on the Schenley Hall
project. With the creation ofHEAA,
renovations could be completed as
early as the fall of I983.” Freeman
said, “After completion of the pro-
ject the students will help to repay
the cost through an imposed activity
fee. The new building authority will
allow us to greatly reduce the fee."

The renovation will be an expen-
§§ive project," according to Louis
Tronzo, assistant vice chancellor for
public affairs, “but pursuing it
through the HEAA will save a lot of,
money, possibly a 3% to 4% reduc-
tion in costs. Pitt’s Student Union
should be an attractive place that
students can call home. particularly
the commuters. Right now, it’s _a dis-
mal building that is not designed for
student use."

Future projects that might use the
HEAA funding process include the
construction of new residence halls
for the fraternities, renovation ofthe
field house, and a new building for
the Graduate School of Business.

At this time, Pitt is the only local
‘Jschool that can benefit from the
" authority. The Municipality Act of
I945, which allows local govern-
ments to establish such authorities,
limits usage to private institutions.
The law may be ammended how-
ever, in the future to include other

is engaged in. Pittsburgh is becom-

a lot of people to the city through its’
programs, research - and facilities
and the authority will help them save

- “Reagan's federal hiring freeze is
one devastating action,” Kane said.
“It’s sterilizing the agency (OSHA)
and means no inspections.

“The freeze prevents the replace-
ment of industrial hygiene and
safety inspectors. They leave for the
big bucks in private industry, and so
now the inspection crews are under-
staffed,” Kane explained.

Kane referred to Secretary of
Labor Raymond Donovan as a
“weasel in a henhouse.“ Donovan
was an official of a construction
company in New Jersey. Kane com-
mented that Donovan’s tie to indus-

said.

The administration’s decision to

angered "labor. ‘ .

“But, they say it will cost industry‘

$300 - $600'miIlion more to label

the dancers enthusiastically
applauded and yelled. The mara-
thon had begun. The two-and three-
year veterans started out
conservatively, .while others jumped
right into some energetic rocking
and shaking.

Fifty-four couples boogied for 24
hours to raise over $9,000 for the
American Heart Association during
the third annual Greek dance mara-
thon for charity this past Friday and
Saturday. . 0

Each year the Panhellenic Coun- 7‘
cil (Panhel) and the lnterfraternity
Council (IFC), the collective
governing bodies of the sororities
and fraternities respectively, com-
bine for one week of fund-raising
projects for a particular charity. The 3
charity chosen to be the recipient of
the funds this year is the American
Heart Association. The marathon is
one of several fund-raising projects
the sororities and fraternities organ-
ize as part ofthe preparation for the
Greek Week celebration beginning

Alex Haley

Haley, the eldest ofthree sons ofa
college professor and a grammar
school teacher mother, said he

“became a writer quite accident-

rally."

, After finishing two years of col-
lege, Haley enlisted in the U.S.
Coast Guard in I939 as a messboy.
To pass time, he started writing
“personalized love letters." for his
fellow seamen from index cards that
listed each girlfriehd’s likes, dislikes,
expectations and the like. Haley was
soon dubbed “the Love Correspond-
ent of the Coast Guard” and was
receiving $1 a letter. He then started

"_'_t‘.,writing articles for magazines and

%I/

 

later became the Coast Guard’s first
official journalist.

Haley wrote for ‘‘Reader’s Digest”
and did an interview series for “Play-
boy” after he retired from the ser-
vice. His first book, “The
Autobiography of Malcolm X,” was
published in 1965 and sold over
eight million copies. Next, Haley
began the 12-year search for his
roots that would take him to Africa
25 times and lead to extensive
research in both the Library of Con-
gress and the British Museum.

When asked if he had felt any dis-
couragement during the I2 years,

Thelpitt Niews,'1l./farcli 9'1‘  ‘W

Haley said that his greatest trauma
came during the three years ofwrit-
ing the book “Roots." i

Haley said his trauma began when
he was in San Francisco while trying
to write about Kunta Kinte’s voyage
across the Atlantic in a slave ship.

“I asked myself what business did
I have to write about a man on a
slave ship while I sat in a carpeted
high-rise apartment," Haley said.

As a result, Haley decided to take
a freighter ship from Africa to Flor-
ida. It was on this ship where he
wrote about Kunta l(inte’s voyage.
He wrote every night lying on -a
plank in the hole ofthe ship. Haley
said it was much “the same type of
dark, cold, and eerie hole” that
Kinte must have stayed in on his
voyage.

On the third night, Haley came
close to jumping over the side ofthe
ship. He said he was over $50,000 in
debt and he was years late delivering
his book" to his editors. Just before
jumping, however, he heard voices
from his past, and he made a prom-
ise to himself to go on with his
writing. -

Haley’s writing did payioff with
“Roots.” Haley received the Pulitzer
Prize for his book and, in I977,

‘with the new CBS television series

ABC——TV brought “Roots” to tele-
vision in a mini-series that gained
critical acclaim.

Haley said he is presently involved

“Palmerstown,” on which he collab-
orated with Norman Lear. Haley
indicated that the story was drawn
out of his own hometown
experience.

‘‘I’m very excited about the ser-
ies," Haley said. “We havejust fin-
ished filming l0 new shows and the
first is set to air March I7."

Throughout his answers to the
audience’s question, Haley emphas-
ized the importance of oral history.

“I am utterly fascinated with oral
history,” Haley said. “Oral tradition
is a beautiful human experience that
cuts across every culture, race and
religion.”

Haley said it is generally agreed
among historians that oral history
is usually kept accurate for 150
years. He also said the story of
“Roots” is primarily the saga of a
people, not a family.

Haley closed the two-hour pro-
gram by encouraging members of
the audience to find out about their
own families by seeking out the old-
est members and to record their
recollections for future generations.

An increase in military aid to El
Salvador’s government could lead to
a regional war that ties down
already-pressed U.S. resources, thus
achieving a “major Soviet objec-
tive,” according to a report Saturday
in Foreign Policy magazine.

The temptation to escalate U.S.

I involvement by providing weapons

and advisors to Central American
rightists should be weighed against a
number of considerations, writes
‘author Robert S. Leiken.

He says such actions would:

By WALTER WATSON

David Ember, a junior at the
Tyler Schol of art (Temple Univer-
sity) in Philadelphia, was granted at
least 500 reasons last week for sport-
ing a winning smile ‘on his face.
Ember was the recipient of a $500
first prize in the National Society of
Arts and Letters regional drawing
competition. The awards presenta-
tion, sponsored by the Pennsylvania
chapter of the society, was held last
Wednesday night at Pitt’s own UP

_ Gallery.

“I bet you’re wondering what I’m
going to do with the money,” said
Ember, the 21-year-old resident of
York, Pa.. “Well I’m guess I can tell
you what I’m going to do with at
least some of it. I’m going to buy a
bicycle and ride across the country.
There’s a lot of interesting stuff to
see; I’d like to draw some ofit while
I’m out there,” said Ember.

Ember’s drawing, “That Point
Right Before,"which won first prize,
along with other drawing entries
from around the state, will be on
display at the UP Gallery now
through March 14.

Other winners in this years coni-
petition were Denise Mickilowski of
Woodhaven, N.Y., also from the
Tyler School of Art, whose drawing
“Burial Site” took second award
honors ($300): Christopher Lambl
of Pittsburgh, who graduated with a
bachelor of fine arts degree in I977
from Carnegie~MeIlon University,
placed third with his drawing,
“Alice"; and Patricia Kowalok of
Ambler, Pa., who received honora-
ble mention ($100) with a self-
portrait entitled, “Cheney Study.”

prize winner and David Ember (right), first prize winner.

La mbl, the third

Christopher

-award recipient, saw the award as

his “first big break.” _

“It has been eight long years of
struggle and I am grateful for this
honor the society. has given me. As
far as teaching goes, the art ﬁeld is
very flooded,” said Lambl, who
holds a M.F.A. from Pratt Institute
in New York.

“Every little bit helps. I’ve been
teaching part time at Mount
Lebanon High School, some adult
education classes in drawing and
painting, and also at the Arts "and
Craft. Center (Fifth Ave. and
Shady). Winning in competitions

0 here and elsewhere help build up

your confidence,” he said. Lambl
plans to~mov_e back to New York

City shortly to work as a freelance
commercial illustrator.

The National Society of Arts and
Letters is a national organization
that helps to promote career-bound
students in the fine and performing

arts. The society sponsors competi- s

tions each year in one of five catego-
ries (each category is represented
twice each decade): art, dance,

from the Pittsburgh chapter (the
only one in the state), both emphas-
ize that the sums of money given out
by the society are far less important
than the valuable contacts the
society is able to establish with the
profesional arts world. Underscor-
ing the point made by both women is
the example of I978 regional and
subsequent national music award
winner, Gwendolyn Bradley. After
winning first prize in the society’s
“nationals,” the Pittsburgh native, a
lyric soprano, appeared lastsummer
as a featured artist at the Hollywood
Bowl. Since then, she has appeared
on the stage of the Metropolitan
Opera House in New York.

Ember, with hopes of winning the
$3000 first prize later on this month
at the society‘s national drawing
competition in St. Louis, Mo., said
that he ‘hasn't made any definite
plans as to where he will go after
finishing school. He said that things

are “still pretty much up in the air."

“The award has given me a good
deal of self-assurance. It’s a very
positive and reinforcing thing. l‘ve
always loved drawing and painting,
ever since I can remember finger
painting. There’s a lot of things I
want to do. I still have time to plan

them out.gI might go on to graduate ‘

school; my sister, Kathy, is a free-
lance illustrator. _l’d.likc doing that,
but I'm not in a big hurry right now.

If there’s one thing that this award
'hasn’t done is change my plans.
What it has done, most certainly, is
helped to give me confidence in
choosing art for my career.”|

Mike Frank said he didn't have a
date for Friday night so he decided

to come out and dance for the heart

fund. .

And Bill MacCalister summed up -

- a lot of people’s feelings when he A
said, “Not only will I make it all 24
hours, but I'll be out partying when
we're done." _

96KX provided all the music for
the event, along with words of
encouragement. And the 96Kx
Beaver entertained and danced
along with the marathon dancers.
Other guest appearances were made
by WTAE-TV newsperson, Paul A
Long, 96KX disc jockeys, and
McDonald's Hamburglar and.Cap-
tain Crook

After I7 hours and lots of sore

-' muscles, the enthusiasm was still I
there, even though the pace was
slowing down a bit. _

“I hurt all over, but I feel great. 
Once we passed 8:00 a.m., I knew I . I
could make it the rest of the way,”
Carol Barone said. I _

“I was a little sore before, but now. j ‘
I’m on my tenth wind and I don't feel
anything,” Tom Lynskey said. g

Ginny Frank insisted that shepfelt ». *
fine because, “the Ben-Gay was ' _
doing its job," and Michelle  
Michaux was ignoring her nearly-, 
fractured toe. ‘

“I think I’m unco_nscio.us. V

Although my body aches, my ego . .'}'3'
hurt the most when I realized’ -I g «ii;
wasn't as physically fit as I thought,”~‘ 

V said dancer Peter Tsudis. ' f . ,

But themiusic continued, and so," 
did the dancing, until 8:00 Saturday .
night. Everyone- got a_ second wind 
and really hammed it up for ‘_‘Ce_le-V:
brate” as the audience poured_ i'n.g.t‘o
see them finish. As the clock struck-x‘
eight, the 45 remaining couplesw.'ere_.‘~
more than happy to hobble off-this 
dance floor, their home for the. 
24 hours. The feeling was .one{_’ofi
happiness and exhaustion. , 

Patty Davis and Mark Jenninigsff
chairpersonspfor the event from Pain-f
he] and IFC, considered it a great ;_
success. '  '

~“More people were involved,
year and the dancers really wentoiit“

’and got a lot of donations. The Pitts-
burgh businesses were very gener-

ous. We were very thankful,” Davis
said. A I ’ "
“Our sponsors also idid’a great
job. Strohs contributed prizesgi;:,.f
the dancers, and McDonalds supp-f
lied all the food for 24 hours,‘ said"
Jennings. “We couldn’t have d‘one§;iti
without them. '96KX supplied alft I
music and some prizes, too.'TIi
really helped contribute_toward the
great success of the marathon’, The’
heart association really pitched.-'i_
too. We're glad to be helping’ the

out.” I -- . 

“I had a really good time.
really rough between the sixthrgii
eighth hours-and I wasn’t.sure'I_
going to make it. After the eig
hour, though, I knew I could stick?
out,” Jeff Klink said. [23,

“The last few minutes werei-._.f_t
best part. It was all worth it;..$I'rn
definitely coming. back again-

year,” Carol Barone said. 
Dawn Crist said the only thing
could think ‘of at the end‘was?“
ting a shower as soon as p,'ossibl
maybe even two .or three."_--§°H'
partner Brad Ziker, was looking for-,
ward to “a good night’s sle‘ep'.”"

“We never been so exhaust
my life, but I really had such afggcatj
time. I’m recommending it to all 
friends for next year and Iim sure
be back,” Carol Miller s_aid.—  If

  Reagan’s
Choice 0

What is the value of a human life? Not very high,
according to the Reagan administration. Recent Rea-
gan proposals attacking the effectiveness of the Occu-
pational Safety and Health Act and the Clean Air Act
illustrate the priorities of the new administration—
industry ranks higher than job safety and environmen-
tal concerns.

First, the Occupational Safety and HealthAdminis-
tration (OSHA), is being crippled by Reagan’s federal
hiring freeze. OSHA’s function is to insure that indus-
tries comply with safety and healthregulations. But
OSHA inspectors are lured by the higher salaries that
private industry offers, and under Reagan's freeze they
cannot be replaced.

Second, Reagan is withdrawing an important
OSHA regulation, one designed to force industry to
label chemicals laborers must work with. The ratio-.
nale for withdrawing the regulation? Money, of
course. It would cost industry more to label the chemi-
cals.

Labor is also alarmed at the possible re-
implementation of the Schweiker bill, a bill they say
will destroy OSHA. The bill stipulates that no inspec-
tions of an industry are permitted until a certain
number of injuries occur. A

“We’ve actually reached the point where there’s a
price on human life. No one investigates why 100,000
people die just because they go to~work,” said United
Auto Worker Bill Kane. ‘

Labor is not the only faction upset about the Rea-
gan moves and the generaltrend toward supporting
industrial interests. Environmentalists are concerned
with whether or not Congress will renew the Clean Air
Act. This legislation, aimed at reducing air pollutants
and cancer-causing agents in the air, comes before
Congress this year for renewal. '

Environmental and labor interests are now combin-
ing forces against the Reagan moves. The National
Coalition of Environmentalist and Labor Organiza-

. tions say it intends to make the public aware of Rea-
gan’s position by targeting states, holding rallies, and
setting up congressionsl liaisons. Recently, 20 environ-
mental and labor groups met at Pittsburgh’s Hilton
Hotel to discuss various strategies to defend their posi-
tion. V

The groups face powerful opposition from an
organization that wields clout with the Reagan forces:
big business. Environmental and labor interests have
taken a positive first step by forming a coalition. But to
fight the political power business holds, they will need
strong support from the public.

The alarming and self-serving priorities of the Rea-
gan administration are clearly exemplified by these ‘
pro-industry moves. To place monetary and political
interests ahead of public safety and health says little
about the so-called “morality” of- Reagan and his
right-wing followers. ' , ‘ ‘

Temple Shares Pitt’s Financial Plight

(Editor's note: the following column
was submitted in’ response to a
column request by The Pitt News)

By NEIL A. SHEEHAN

News Editor, The Temple News

As state-related, urban universi-
ties, Temple and Pitt share an expe-
rience both troubling and unique.

Because both institutions must
rely on the state legislature for a
huge portion of their budgets in the
form of appropriations, they remain
unfortunate-ly subservient to the
changing political climate in Harris-
burg. With their very existence hing-
ing on state subsidies, the

relationship between the schools"

and the legislature is a tenuous one,
growing progressively worse in

I recent years. Tuition at Temple has

increased almost 100 percent since
I975 because of reduced state
support. ' A" "

This development has ired many
students and led to several protests
‘in the form of rallys. A tuition task
force comprised of student leaders is
currently organizing to fight a pre-
dicted 10 to 15 percent tuition
increase next year.‘

Of special concern to the ad hoc
group is the upcoming appropria-
tion hearing for Temple and the
‘other state-related schools sche-
duled for early March inthe state
capital. .

The group remains convinced that
a stand must be taken -‘now to
emphasize to state lawmakers that
Temple students DO care how much
they pay for an education.

The relationship between the state ,

' ”As state-related, urban

universities, Temple
and Pitt share an ex-
perience both troubling
and unique."

and schools such as Temple and Pitt
is being re-evaluated and is ceriain
to undergo even closer scrutiny in
the future.

Another common characteristic
of Temple and Pitt is their ‘urban
location. Temple is located in the
heart of North Philadelphia, a
ghetto area once referred to by Phi-
ladelphia Magazine as “the jungle.”
Housing is generally deteriorated
and among the worst in the city.

Security is a major concern ofstu-
dents and faculty alike. Last semes-
ter a dramatic rise in robberies and
assaults took place on campus and
the university administration
worked frantically to remedy the
situation. The university hired a
number of new security officers and
implemented other safety measures
ranging from the locking of usually
open doors to photo l.D.’s.

Temple is essentially a commuter
school and because of the fear of
crime which permeates the campus,
most students come to class and then
quickly flee home on the‘ subway.
This leads to a lack of unity among
students and a poor campus self-
identity. .. No bars anywhere near
campus does not help the situation.

Despite its problems, Temple still
provides a quality education for the
serious student with a fine faculty
and diversified curriculum.

Our school of communications
and theater isconsidered one of the
finest in the country and our busi-
ness school is quickly gaining in
prestige. We also boast s_ome
renowned alumni including Bill
Cosby, Norman Fell, David Brenner
and Hall and Oates.

Chipman Analysis: Constructive?

Dear Editor:

One must wonder what function
The Pitt News serves for the univer-
sity community. I have always
understood that one such purpose of
collegiate journalism is to ‘stimulate
student involvement with university
organizations and programs.

In the Feb. 5 issue, Amin Ghos-
sein’s “Pep Talk” (as termed by the
paper) was destructively over-
critical towards the new Pitt basket-
ball program, coach Roy Chipman
and clearly the product of an ignor-
ant sports. reporter attempting to fill
space. ~ .

Ghossein termed the Panthers’
I980-8l season as a negative one.
On what criteria did he base this rash
and unfair, not to mention ridicu-
lous, decision? According to the
article, Ghossein considers this.sea-
son a “disappointing one",be_cause

 

 

much a Ghossein desired.
. If Ghossein was not soconcerned

with writing shocking argumenta-

tive trash, he might have realized
that this has been Pitt basketball’s
most successful season ever.
cannot judge a coach, especially a
first-year coach, only on his winning
percentage. D/r." Chipman has done

for Pitt basketball what no other‘

coach or man has ever done here.

The basketball" program, with its
pledge for big time basketball hired
Chipman and found the ‘man they
were looking for.

Chipman came into charge of a
dying basketball program here at
Pitt. ln his "first ‘year, Chipman has
made the program Big Timely A

ketball program without big time
facilities. regardless, of the coach!,

the Field House to a l0,000 seat
capacity. Chipman, at least, now
has the comparable facilities needed
to win recruiting battles, which in
turn build strong programs.

When Chipman came to Pitt, the
Panthers were a poorly disciplined
team. He turned the attitudes of the
Pitt players into positive ones.

According to sources closely related '

to the team, the Panthers are now a
dedicated team that displays’ posi-
tive, hard working attitudes in prac-
tice. The players’. sometime
apparent lackadaisical attitudes are

' therresidue ofpoorly run Pitt basket-

ball programs of the past. . .

The Pitt News, March 9, I981 

Chipman

These attitudes are winning atti-
tudes, attitudes whichiwere not’.on
the Pitt basketball __team in past
years. As for Ghosseiri’s overly criti-
cal and uncalled for review, I’m sure
1 speak for many when saying that I
feel this “review” was misinformed,
together
ignorant.

Ghossein had the gall to refer to
the Panthers’ 15-10 record as “ord-
ingary!” More than half the college
teams in the nation don’t even sport
winning records. Evidently Ghos-
sein’s criteria for judgment of big
time basketball is that a team must
have an .800 record, of which only
one or two teams achieve per year.
This is Chipman’s first year, a year
which a great deal of rebuilding and
reorganizing occur. One cannot
expect a perfectly built powerhouse
overnight. If it was possible, every
university would hire a new coach so
they could win the national
championship.

From the article it is apparent that
Ghossein is quite in the dark about

the game of basketball. Ghossein
obviously feels that Chipman over-
uses the 1-3-1 zone. Surprisingly,
Ghossein at least realized that this is
the most suitable defense for the
small Panthers, but he fails to realize
that a team should continue to play
their game and stay with what brings
them the most success. V

Ghossien criticizes Chipman for
not picking up changes in opposing
defenses and not taking full advan-
tage of the game’s rules. It is not the
coach’s job to recognize new
defenses; it is the responsibility of
the offensive leader on the floor,
usually the point guard. As for
Ghossein’s other complaints, a good
coach doesn't lose his poise. In the
Duquesne game, Chipman showed
his poise by not losing his compo-
sure and following “pleas” of frus-
trated players; he stuck to his game
plan.

Another argument that Ghossein
presented in his review against Chip-
man was the fact that the coach did

‘not know how to use his bench.

Ghossein implied that Chipman
should give Darrel Gissendanner
and Dave Olinger more playing
time. Ghossein is obviously
unaware that Chipman has tried
extensive on and off court practices
to improve one of the above players’
court composure. This lack of men-
tal play is the reason this player does
not receive the playing time that
many feel -he deserves.. As to their
contribution to the strength of the
team, Olinger and Gissendanner
have the third and fourth lowest
shooting percentages respectively on
the team of 14. In the game of'bas-
ketball, a team can only put ﬁve
players on the floor at a time. I think
it is obvious that replacing a Carlton
Neverson or a Dwayne Wallace with

continued from page twelve

weaker players would not be beneﬁ-
_cial to the team’s strength. Every
coach wants to win, and will play the
players that he feels will best achieve
that goal. ...—-

The Rutgers’ game, in which the
bench played asignificant part in the
victory, demonstrates C\hipman‘s
ability to use the bench to his best
advantage. The improved play of
the substitutions also shows Chip-
man’s talent in stimulating personal
improvement through hard practice.

Chipman and the Panthers are, in
my opinion, having their best year
ever. The Panthers have a good
record and have been competitive
with the powerhouse schools they
played. Pitt basketball is on its way

up! Ghossein’s “Pep Talk” is a chip

Temple

A branch campus in center city in
the old Mike Douglas studio build-
ing has been an unqualified success
offering an alternative location for
students to attend classes. A beauti-

ful suburban branch campus’ also
offers a similar alternative.

The most pressing question now
facing Temple and Pitt is what lies
ahead for them in the coming years.

Panthers Win 64-60; AdVallCe t0 NCAAl’S

Pitt's Dwayne Wallace came on in the second half of the Pitt-Duqpuense game at the Eastern
8 finals to take control of the Pitt offensive attack. Here, Wallace shoots over Duquesne’s

John Moore and Pitt's Lennie McMillian for two of his 19 points.

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Pitt News Assistont Sports Editor

The game is only seconds old
when Lennie McMillian gets into his
act. Andy Sissinni, the freshman
point_ guard from Duquesne, is his
first victim. Cocky Sissinni casually

dribbles to the right ofthe key, look— .

ing for an opening. He glances left,
then right, then..well, he commits a
sin. He turns his back on the player
they call “Snake,” and that was his
downfall. “Snake” McMillian’s eyes
bulge slightly at the mistake. He
sneaks up behind his prey and, with
a ﬂick of his wrist, the ball is in Pitt’s
possession, en route to an easy two
points.

The same game now is well into

the second half. After holding com-
fortable leads of 10 points, the Pitt
offense has. suddenly stalled and, in
effect, came to a halt. The Dukes are
within four points at 42-38. Dwayne
Wallace, in complete control, real-
izes the situation and eyes the
defense. The director of offense
dribbles to the left, then to the right,
and decides to take control himself.
Two minutes later, Pitt has some
breathing room with an eight-point

is , lead.

In the basketball scheme of

-I  things, Lennie McMillian is a thief,

and Dwayne Wallace is a ‘creator.
McMillian, the senior from Geor-
gia, perches on his wing position in‘
Pitt's ferocious I-3-1 zone and liter-
ally robs opposing players’ clean,
iwhile’ Wallace creates‘ the 'offense,

scoring,
Duquesne coach Mike Rice felt

the presence of McMillian and Wal-

lace the most in his Dukes’ 64-60
loss. So evident was McMillian that
Rice, upon walking away from the
podium at the post—game news_con-
ference to give way to McMillian,
cautioned the reporters:

“Better nail the mike down,..or
he’ll steal that, too.”

How dominant was McMillian?
In the first half alone “Snakeﬁscored
ll points, stole two passes, batted
away at least five passes and pulled
down three rebounds. More impor-
tantly, McMillian made the
Duquesne guards wary of trespass-
ing into his territory, which took an
important part ofthe Dukes’offense
out of the game. McMillian’s play
dictated the way in which Duquesne
ran its offense.

Unlike the second Pitt-Duquesne
meeting, when the Dukes were able
to get inside the Panther zone,
McMillians’s hands prevented it

from reoccurring by not allowing,

“In the last two months, I have no
doubts that we are one of the best
teams in the East,” said Pitt coach
Roy Chipman following his Panth-
ers‘ 64-60 victory over the Duquesne
Dukes to win the Eastern Eight
Championship.

It was an endingthat no one could
have imagined. Pitt will now
advance to El Paso, Tex. for the
opening round of the NCAA tour-
nament to face Idaho, a 70-64
winner over Montana for the Big
Sky conference crown.

Back on Jan. 3l, Pitt hadjust lost
a ballgame to West Virginia to drop
its record to 9-9 for the season. The
team was having difficulties on the
court, and it seemed that the season
was destined for no glory.

Then, beginning with the next

' game against Duquesne, Feb. 4, Pitt

ran off a streak of six wins against
only two losses to clinch the home-
court advantage in the conference
tournament.

Things were still not ideal, how-.
ever, as Pitt had to open the tourna-

ment against Rutgers, whom Pitt
had never.beaten. Pitt won that
game and also beat regular season
champion Rhode Island by 29
points to get into the finals against
Duquesne.

' Led’ by Lennie McMillian and
Dwayne Wallace, the Panthers
defeated the Dukes to gain the
NCAA berth to play Idaho Friday
night. i ‘
“It‘s a great feeling to win and go
to the tournament,”said McMillian,
who was voted the tournament’s

most outstanding player. McMillian
scored 20 points to lead all scorers,
but his value was most apparent on
defense". He and Carlton Neverson
harassed the Duquesne guards,

,Andy Sissinni and Ronnie Dixon,

into committing key turnovers that
provided Pitt with easy baskets.

“liswear I didn’t see him steal the

ball," said Duquesne coach Mike,

Rice about McMillian. “I thought
someone from the press table was
reaching out and hitting the ball.

“You have to get ready V for
McMillian and Neverson,” he con-
tinued. “If Pitt forces over 20 turn-
overs, they' will win. Our goal -was
around I6, but it didn’t happen.” '

» ”It's a great Feeling
to win and go to the

Me Millian

Pitt never trailed in the game,
opening an early ll-l lead. after
three minutes of play‘:_Getting the
early lead was important for the
lPanthers because their defense was
throwing Duquesne off-stride.

“They’re playing with alot ofcon-
fidence now,“ said Rice. “I was hop-
ing to stay out oftrouble the first five
minutes because we came out flat.~”'

Pitt then had some trouble scor-

Pin News Sports Editor

Confidence.

lt’s the one word that best des-
cribes the philosophy of Pitt
Panther first-year basketball
coach Roy Chipman.

Confidence. lt enabled Pitt to
steal the Eastern Eight cham-
pionship trophy from the grasp
of regular season co-champions
Rhode Island and Duquesne on
successive nights, and propelled ‘
the Panthers into the NCAA
tournament for the first time in

seven years. ,

Confidence. It gave Pitt’s Len-
nie McMillian the impetus, in the
afterglow of Saturday night's
emotional win over Duquesne
and the announcement that he
had won the tournament’s Out-
standing Player Award, to pre-
dict that Pitt could advance all
the way to the final four in Phila-
delphia to play for the NCAA
championship.

“The way our team is playing,
if we just keep playing well, I
believe we can do it. Really,”
McMillian said.

And it was confidence that
may have finally slew the haunt-
ing memories of former Pitt
coach Tim Grgurich and seasons
past.

Conspiculously gone since the
first Rhode Island game this year
is the multitude of last-second
losses and buckling under pres-
sure that characterized Pitt in
recent seasons. Pitt’s refusal to
crack under the din of the Civic
Arena crowd and Duquesne’s
desperate pressing defense in the
closing minutes on Saturday is
evidence ofthe turnaround. And
it took Roy Chipman to start it.

“You try to instill confidence
as a coach,” said Chipman. “The
emotion the team brings to prac-
tice and to the games depends on
it. Our kids just picked up on it
and they took over the team with
their leadership.”

But it wasn't easy.

Chipman assumed the head
coaching job last year, late in the

recruiting season and in the emo-
tional aftermath of the Grgurich
resignation, a touchy issue early
in the season that lately has been
reduced to a euphemistic “dis-
traction”. But it was only one of‘
many.

There was the defection of
freshman Brett Crawford, a
blue-chip recruit, from the team
in early December, the short sus-
pension and re-instatement in
early January of Panthers
McMillian and Ed Wallace fol-
lowing a dormitory incident, and
key injuries to guard John Ryan,
Ed Scheuerman and Charles
Williams that tapped some of
Pitt’s bench strength. Public crit-
icisms raged in the early going, as
the Pitt team struggled up to
midseason with a 9-9 record.

Then there was the rap against
Chipman, who came to Pitt as a
virtual unknown to the majority
of the public. Despite the gaudy
226-83 record he compiled over
l3 years of coaching in the colle-
giate ranks, including 60 wins in
his last three seasons. Chipman
had beefed up the mark on lesser
opponents in a borderline Div-
ision l school, Lafayette, and two
other Division ll colleges. After
the slow start, questions arose as
to whether the team and the
coach could adjust and over-
come the problems.

At Saturday’s post-game press
conference following the cham-
pionship victory, Chipman was
asked if he had foreseen Pitt‘s
rebound, capped in the second
half of the season by winning
nine of its last ll games and the
Eastern Eight Champion’s auto-
matic NCAA berth.

“No, I didn’t foresee it. You
start to doubt yourself and what
you’re doing. I was thinking
about how nice it was at
Lafayette with no pressure,”
Chipman said, laughing. “We
were doing pretty well there; we
were winning. But this is where 1
want to be.

Pitt first-year head coach Roy Chipman celebrates after Pitt defeated Duquesne to earnan
automatic bid to the NCAA Far West Regionals in El Paso, Texas.

“When. we started to get
together as a team, I had no
doubts at all that we could beat

anyone in the league.”

And, judging from the results
of the Eastern Eight tournament
this weekend, such conﬁdence
seems,to have been the missing

ingredient in Pitt basketball

teams since the arrival of Sam
Clancy four years ago.
Pitt had the talent on the court

to go further in post-season play
with Clancy, Wayne Williams,
Terry Knight and Larry Harris, a
one-man scoring machine from
the outside. But they never made
it to the’NCAA tournament, not

since the 1973-74 season, and the 7
glory years with Billy Knight,- ._
when the Panthers won 22 in a A‘ 
row. That year, Pitt advanced all 
the way tothe Eastern Regional"
Finals, one step short of the 
NCAA final four and a chance to 
play for the national champion-,

 Pitt Surprises RI
In Semi-Final Rout  

  

By MIKE DICHIARA
Pitt News Sports Writer .

lt was one of those games that is
hard to understand. Pitt was out-
rebounded by Rhode Island 37-32.
Pitt shot 4! percent from the floor
and 76 percent from the line, com-
pared to Rhode Island's 39 and 72
percent respectively. Rhode Island
blocked seven shots while Pitt only
blocked two. Rhode Island even
had more assists, I I-7.

But that’s why the only statistic
that counts‘ is the score. The Pitt
Panthers crushed the Eastern Eight
regular season co-champion and
tournment‘s top-seeded Rhode
Island Rams 74-45. at the Civic
Arena Friday night.

“I look at the stat sheet and see we
had 32 turnovers; that’s the ball
game," said Rhode lsland assistant
coach Claude English. “You can't
turn it over that many times and
expect to win. We’re fortunate that
we didn’t get beat by 50 points."

Rhode lsland’s only lead came 39
seconds into the game when Pappy
Owens hit an I8-foot jumper for a
.2-0 lead.

I Pitt then took control and had a
nine-point lead, mainly because
Sam Clancy made five baskets dur-

mg the first 10 minutes of the half; .

four, 27-23, but Pitt coach Roy
Chipman was not pleased with that
lead.

“They (Rhode Island) didn’t play
a good half and we were only up by

, four,” Chipman said. “I was very

concerned.”
The only Ram in double-ﬁgures

was the games’ high scorer, Jimmy
Wright, who finished with 21 points.
Phil Kydd was next with only eight
points. .

Defensively, _Pitt’s guards,

. Dwayne Wallace and Neverson were

all over the Rams’ guards, causing
them to commit V turnover after
turnover.

‘“At halftime, he (Chipman) told
us to go out and play some defense
on them and make them turn it
over." said Neverson. “We knew if
we pressed the ball, they would turn
it over."

“I thought Wright had a ‘good
game for them but he really didn’t
hurt us,” said Chipman. “We
thought going in that Upshaw and
Owens could hurt us if they were
shooting well, and in the second half
I thought we shut them down well."

“I know we can play harder, better
and more_aggressive'than we Clld

Host Pan therettes take second-place

Women Swimmers Edged Out by Princeton

By SEAN BARNES
Pitt News Sports Writer

The I981 ElAWl Championships
concluded Saturday night at Trees
Pool with last year's Eastern Cham-

pions, the Princeton Tigers, overpo-
wering the the Pitt Pantherettes by
the slim margin of 793-771. In third
place was Penn State with 599
points, followed by Brown (520) and
Yale (464).

The meet went as predicted with
Pitt and Princeton fighting it out
down to the last relay. But the Tig-
ers pulled it out with the extra
strength needed in events like the
200 freestyle, even though the Pan-
therettes were seeded highly in all
the events but the backstroke.

The first event held Thursday
night was representative of all three
days of the Easterns competition.
The event, the 200-yard medley
relay. was won by Princeton, with
Pitt placing second, by only thirty-
nine-hundredths of a second. Both
teams beat the old 200 medley relay
meet record, and both teams quali-
tied for Nationals. All three days of
the competition continued to have
close, fast finishes.

The strong competition in the
meet resulted 54 national cuts and l4
new meet records in 24 events.
Fourteen of the 54 nationally quali-
fying times belonged to Pitt, as wll as
four of the 14 broken records.

Pitt’s 400 freestyle relay of Linda
Frankenbach, Amy Jackson_. Denise
Sedlacek, and Jan Ujevich broke the
i979 meet record ‘held by Pitt by a
full second. All three of the other
broken records were swum by
Ujevich.

Ujevich broke the old record of
24.10 in the 50-yard freestyle, set in
l979 by Pitt All-American Kathy
Stetler, with a nationally qualifying

Carolina March 18-21.

time of 23.74. Third place went to
Sedlacek with a 24.37, and also qual-

C ified her for Nationals.

Ujevich also broke the 100-yard
freestyle and I00-yard individual
medley records, both set by Prin-

ceton last year. Pitt's Suzanne Pul- -

ley and Jackson also made national
cuts in the 100 individual medley
and l00 freestyle respectively. Jack-
s0n’s time of 25.81 in the 50-yard
butterfly made the national cutoff as
well.

Princeton's strength came mainly

  
 
 

 

from four girls; breaststroker and
individual medley swimmer Char-
lotte Tiedemann, freestyler Liz

Richardson, backstroker Kaili.

Chun, and diver Chris Moses. These
three swimmers tallied l4 national
cuts and four broken Eastern meet
records. Moses place third in the
one-meter and first in the three-
meter diving events, clearly making
her the best diver of the meet.

' Pitt performed well in diving. The
Pantherettes placed four girls in the

 

top l0 on both boards. As a team,_
‘(rvﬁy   K \-' \/ \./ \,

  

the Pitt divers destroyed even Penn
State, who managed to place thre of
the top 15 on both boards. Unfortu-
nately, Pitt’s head diving coach
Julian Krug was attending the men’s
Easterns on Friday and Saturday
and only saw his girls dive the one-
meter board Thursday.

The best two women swimmers of
the 1981 Easterns were unquestiona-
bly Pitt’s Ujevich and » Princeton’s
Tiedemann. Ujevich won three indi-
vidual events and one relay while
placing second in the 50-yard breast-

stroke and 200-yard individual med-
ley. Tiedemann had four individual
first places, two of them breaking
past Eastern records. She also swam
in Princeton’s winning record-
breaking "200-yardy medley relay.
Princeton's 400-yard medley relay
including Tiedemann placed third,
as did Tiedemann individually in the
I00-yard breaststroke.

Ujevich and Tiedemann were the
only two girls to make the national
cutoff time in every event they
swam.’

Swimmers Capture
Sixth Straight Title

By SEAN BARNES
Pitt News Sports Writer '
The Pitt Panther men’s swim team

took the 1981 Eastern championship
held last weekend at Cleveland State
University. It was Pitt's sixth con-
secutive Eastern title.

Pitt’s team strength showed not
only in the water, where Pitt won 13
of 18 events, but also at poolside as
Pitt head coach was named Coach of
the Year. Panther swimmers receiv-
ing meet honors were Sandy Pid-
geon, named Most Outstanding
Individual. Swimmer, and Mike
Minik, Most Outstanding Diver.

Pitt.‘s winning point total was 54],
followed by West Virginia Univer-

‘ sity with 503 and Maryland with

395.

The meet started out poorly for
Pitt. Panther Greg Pelton finished
fourth in the 500—yard freestyle
behind West Virginia, which swept

first, second and third. Pitt came -

back quickly in.the following event,
the 200—yard individual medley, as
Scott Shearer and Pidgeon finished

I first and second in the event. Both

Lewis and Pidgeon were glad to see
Shearer do so well in an event in
which he was seeded low.

The 50-yard freestyle was next.
Pitt's Rick Carter, last year’s champ,
did it again, setting an Eastern con-
ference record of 20.6 seconds. Penn
State placed second.

Pitt divers Minik and Pat Green-
well did as expected in the one-meter
diving, taking first and third respec-
tively. Greenwell was last year’s

needs and gua

Eastern one-meter champion.
Following one-meter diving was
the first relay of the Easterns, the
400-yard medley. Pitt won the event
in the 1977-79 Easterns and did it

again this year with two—time All-

American backstroker Stu Swanson
leading the relay to victory, along
with freshman breaststroker John
Waldman, butterﬂier Mike Lehto,

_ and anchorman Carter. For fresh-

man Lehto, it was a tough I00-yard
butterﬂy in the relay as he had swum
the 500 freestyle in preliminaries
that afternoon and again in the first
event that night, in which he placed
seventh.

Another conference record was
broken by Pitt in the 400 individual
medley. Pidgeon powered to a 4102.6
finish in the event with WVU second
and Pitt’s Pelton third. For Pelton,
it was an example of pure determi-
nation. He was originally seeded
ninth and had already swum the S00
freestyle in preliminaries and finals
and the 400 IM in preliminaries. The
200 freestyle went as expected with
Shearer placing first and Carter
close behind Villanova’s Todd Rus-
sell for third. WVU then came back
and won the lO0—yard butterﬂy as
Pitt’s L_ehto finished fourth.

Pitt won the next three events: the
100 backstroke, the 100 breaststroke
and the 400 freestyle relay. For the
fourth year in a row, the 100-yard
backstroke was won by Swanson. In
_the lO0—yard breaststroke, Pitt
freshman _Waldman defeated Mary-
land’s Kirk Sanocki for one of the

Pitt enters this year’s NCAA
tourney intent on surprising a
few teams by continuing the late-
season style of play, led by a
tenacious defense, which cata-
pulted them to the league crown.

Chipman commended Clancy
and Dwayne Wallace especially
for their roles down the stretch
and the leadership they provided
the team, citing the first Rutgers
game Jan. l0 as the turning point
of the season.

“We told the guys at midsea-
son, if this season was going to
go, we had to stop worrying
‘about last year or the past, and
that we had to get it together,”
Chipman said. “Clancy and Wal-
lace took over and gave us that

leadership you need to win."

Chipman illustrated the point
with a brief example:

;‘‘I’m only 5—foot-9 and I60
pounds, and not very intimidat-
ing. But Sam Clancy is 6-foot—7
and 250, and if he tells you to
play, you play,” Chipman said.

The victory had to be a per-
sonal vindication for Chipman,
after the rocky early start. Nor-
mally a low-key and .undemon-
strative coach, Chipman showed
tournament
crown and victory over
Duquesne meant to him after the
game as the'Pitt players hoisted

’ him up to the basket so he could

cut the last few strands ofthe net.
Chipman thrust his arms into the
air, waving the net above the
cluster of players and letting out
a yell that's probably still
echoing. '

“Dwayne made it go tonight along

“The success ofthe team is deter-

counts.” g

The Panthers were ajoyous bunch
at the end of the game. Cutting the

net from the rim is a ritual as old as

“My duty as the point guard is_ to A

don‘t have the ball, l’d like to see
somebody else who can handle the

there as well as a point. guard."

Pitt was able to stretch its lead to
12 points with about five minutes
remaining in the game. Even though
the Dukes were able to make it close

of confidence.

chance to cut a piece of the net to

“I don.'t know what to say,” said
McMillian. ‘‘I‘m real happy to have
