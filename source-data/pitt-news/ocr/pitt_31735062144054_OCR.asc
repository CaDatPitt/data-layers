Owl Deadline 
December 10 '-

After December 10 it will be
easier to find a tweed suit thaneto
buy an Owl. “Under no circum-
stances will the Monday deadline
for ‘buying the Owl be extended,”
said Dorothy Anthony, circulatio
manager. 

Appointments for pictures, to be
taken at Gimbel’s, may be made
in the Owl ofﬁce. It is necessary
to make an appointment in order
to avoid overcrowding at the
studio. Milton Tokash, assistant
circulation manager, emphasized
the fact that appointments are
made at the convenience of the
Owl buyer.

In order to maintain uniformity,
all undergraduate women must
wear sweaters and pearls and un-
dergraduate men long ties and
jackets. Senior women will have
their pictures taken in drapes,
while those of senior men will be
taken in tuxedoes. The clothing
for the seniors will be provided
by the studio. _

To a senior the Owl costs ﬁve
dollars. Underclassmen are charg-
ed four dollars.

La Rue Moss, editor, said‘ that
it is hoped that the Owl will be
ready next May for distribution
on Tap Day.

IF Formal Ball

Pitt’s first post-war formal, the
Interfraternity Ball, will take
place in the Urban Room of the
‘William Penn Hotel on Friday,
December 14, according to chair-
man Bob Nagel.

one of the biggest dances of the
year, and because of the increased
number of fraternity men in
school, the dance this year will be
bigger and more successful,” said
ticket chairman Arnie Steinman.
Since 80 per cent of themenin
each fraternity are required to at-
tend, at least 275 couples are ex-
pected,” he concluded. -v

gram of entertainment. The Sig-
ma Chi’s will defend the title they
won last year. Dick Smith, presi-
dent of the IF Council, is chairman

“Dollar A Head; World Ahead”

“Since 1937 relief hasgpne from

“Students in Europe are re-

The second assembly of the year, sponsorcd. by Student

Congress, will take place tomorrow at 11:30 o’clock "in the
Sttcphen Foster Memorial.

Once again we are asking for your full support and coop-
eration. Our plea, may be tiresome reading, but it gets tiresome
writing, too. Yct, because We feel that you have not given
your full support and cooperation, we will continue to demand

that some of your time and atttention be turned to campus

events. W'e feel that we are not asking you to give up an
hour or two in the Tuck Shop for sometlling wasteful. No, we
wouldn’t ask you. to leave your cokes, and cozy booths for any-
thing so dr:_1.stic. lt.’s just thazt we think you would actually
enjoy attendingthc Student assembly. Toniorrow, the program
has been so arranged that you will hear Dr. T. Z. Koo, a. promi-
nent Chinese Cliristimi loader, describe his “’l‘hrec Years in
Occupied China.” llc has many stimulating stories we know
will not bore you.

To round out tthc asscnibly program, the University orches-
tra will play selections from “Sliovvl)oa.t” and the University
Male Quartet will give spirited songs in good old fashioned

’ barber shop harmony.

The last assembly program was excellent, the attendance
disgusting. Anyone who was there will. agree with us on that.
Now, all we ask is tlmtt you at least give these programs a fair
chance. Attend one and see for yourself. If you still think that
you can further your cducatioii “furtl1c1"’ by ﬁddling away
time over cokes in the TS, or doodling on the tables, then, we will
consider the matter dropped.

Of course, you remember that although you patronize well
the dances Student Cong_ress plans for your afternoons, they
might regard your lack of_,i11t,e1'est in their other plans as a sign
of immaturity, as a sign of “high-schoolishness” and interpret
your poor response and cooperation as an indication for a com-
plete change of policy.

7/ae pan!/tau 01¢ Z‘/ze Q3

Journalism and advanced writing students, as well as hobby
writers, will have the opportunity to give the Pitt Panther a
helping hand today. All students interested in either the busi-
ness or editorial staffs are invited to attend the meeting Whether
or not they have signed at the previous meeting. The existence
of THE Panther is in the minds of many collcge—minded men
and Women who demonstrate to members of the committee their
interest by constant questions; some have made arrangements to
meet the committee members in order to better understand the
difficulties involved in the "re-orgaiiization of the magazine. Pitt
men and women, whose interests are far removed from writing,
continuously seek information concerning THE Panther. These
students realize the need of a monthly magazine on Pitt ’s cam-
pus to supplement the News and the Owl. By encouraging a
deeper pride in our University, by stimulating the quality of
University writing and by oﬁering to the students and faculty a
magazine of Pitt and by Pitt, we, the students, can prove to any
skeptics of such a magazine that individualism and spirit among
the student body are not extinct, but rather a burning ﬂame.

'rH_r:_31_1-T NEWS

.1‘:

Last week ﬁve men met with
Mr. Hoffman and Dr. Johnson in
the office of the Dean of Men.
Their purpose was to discuss, in-
formally, the purpose of a vet-
erans’ organization on the campus.
There seemed to be no lack of
agreement that the main objec-
tives of a Veterans group should
be concerned primarily with Em-
ployment, Housing, and Scholar-
ship. Don’t let that “scholarship”
frighten you, the boys had in mind
a fund to provide a means of fin-
ishing school, once started, for

G.I.’s whose 3-16 time ran out. The
problem of Employment and
Housing are apparent. Housing
will be the more difficult to solve
since" this situation is apt to be-
come more acute as increasing
numbers of vets return to school.
With the purpose of organization
fairly well determined, the men
felt that before submitting a con-
stitution to the veteran group, a
certain amount of time should
elapse during which every means
of familiarizing vets with the aims
of -the organization should be em-
ployed. Since it will be entirely
depen-dent on the veteran student
-body to accept or reject any or-
ganization in their behalf, it is
hoped that interested men will
discuss their own views on «the
subject and be ready to attend a
general meeting with some well
deﬁned opinions. In the meantime
informal meetings will take place
in the Dean’s Office, which any
vet may attend. Contact Al Cap-

There’s good news this morn-
ing. Lots of big events coming up
this week, so read you eager beav-
ers, all two of you, and pant!

The World Student Service
Fund drive starts off with a bang
next week when Miss I-Iuguette
Balzola, traveling secretary, comes
to speak in 132 SL at 3:30 o‘clock
Monday afternoon. Miss Balzola
was born in Paris, lived in France
and Spain un-til 1937. You remem-
ber what happened in ‘37 —— the
so-callelcl “Spanish Civil War,” the
first ominous rumble of Fascist ag-
gression in “Europe, began. From
that time on Miss Balzola lived in

Mexico until 1941 when she start-
ed working on her degree at the

University of Kentucky. Very ac-

tive on campus, Mi.ss Balzola grad-
uated last year “with high hon-
or.”

From the few facts above, you
can easily see that "Miss Balzola
can speak with authority on the
problems of students, particularly
u1ii\.':rsity students, all over the
world. WSSF, to paraphrase, is
“of the students, by the students,
and for the students.” This is your
chance to hear about your fellow
students: French, Spanish, Mexi-
can, call the roll. And not only
to hear-—to ‘HELP, for without
material aid, that “brave new
world a-borning” will die in its
infancy.

Last note of the week is to re-
mind that Christmas cards are
now on sale in the book-store at
a mere ﬁve cents apiece. Heinz
Chapel, the Cathedral of Learn-
ing, the Commons Room ﬁre place,
and the Na-tivity scene from a pre-
vious student Christmas play are
pictured on the cards. The choice
is yours.

Oh yes, one large P. S. to YW

the fall of 1942 as an ensign and
after his oﬁ‘i-cer’s indoctrination
course at Princeton was assigned
to the Navy’s amphibious forces.
For the next two years -he was
executive ofﬁcer of an IiC‘T ﬂo-
tilla of 36 ships, in cha.rge of per-
sonnel and t'he handling of admin-
istrative affairs. It was during this
service with the Atlantic Fleet
that he took part in the invasion
of France.

Indirectly, too, he was in on one
of the three main crossings of the
Rhine, achieved in March this
year. The unit to which Lt. Ebert

was assigned transported 36 foot

Charles H. Ebert, Jr.
and 50 foot landing craft on huge

trailers from the wharvesof Le
Havre to inland France and later

_to the place chosen for the, Rhine
‘crossing of General Patton’s Third
. Army. Similar landing cra-ft were

moved across Fran-Ce for the other
two Rhine crossings of Hodge’s
and vl\/Iontgomery’s armies.

In June, after the Nazis’ capit-
ulation, Lt. Ebert was transferred

to the Pacific, stationed at Pearl
Harbor and assigned to the staﬁ"ot
Admiral Blandy, C*O!M:DES‘PA«C,
which is Naval parlance for Com-
mander of Destroy-ers in the Pa-
cific. It was Lt. Ebert’s task to
work out a system for keeping
tab on destroyer casualties and
survivors. It was his job to see
that each casualty was given the
necessary medical attention and
that he was not inadvertently side--
tracked to some forward hospital
when his condition made it im-
perative that -he be sent back to
the larger, better-equipped hos-
pitals at Pearl Harbor. And dur-
ing the Okinawa campaign, when
destroyers were particularly ac-
tive in paving the way for Amer-
ican landings, that was no mean
task.

Lt. Ebert remained at Pearl
Harbor until October. On October
26 he landed back in the United
‘States and was eligible to apply
for inactive duty, but having ac-
cumulated‘ 60 days of unused leave
he will remain technically in the
Navy until December 25 when
his leave expires.

Far from being on unfamiliar
ground here at Pitt, Lt. Ebert
know.s his way around well. He
graduated from the ‘College in
1936, as an economics major, and
knows “Fergey”, which practical-
ly constitutes .a key to the school.
During his undergraduat-er days,
he was active in many‘ extracur-
ricular activities, fullback on the
frosh team, manager of boxing in
junior and senior years, member
of the student-faculty executive
committee (precedessor of the stu-
dent congress), organizer of the
Independents, chairman of the
Senior Ball and ‘member of ODK.

Nor did ‘his interest in Pitt stop
with graduation. A member of the
Alumni A.ssociation, he served in
1940 and 1941 on the Alumni
Council -Committee. Until he went
into the Navy he did credit work,
largely auto ﬁnancing, for several
Pittsburgh ﬁrms.

Do Your Bit

By Agent X-33,1

Has your D.A. been slipping
lately, gals? No, it doesn’t stand
for district attorney and we don’t
mean your goidle, either. In short,
D. A. me-ans date appeal. If you
have it then life will be a comfy
bed of roses but if you lack it,
then you can just go on wallowing
around‘ in onions.

Date appeal is an elusive qual-
ity. True, there are rules such as
always wearing socks that match,
never dragging your babushka
through your escorts sphaghetti,
and not wearing purple skirts with
green sweaters; but one can follow
the rules faithfully and still end
up with a very unmellow melon.

Therefore, in an effort to ﬁnd
out just what date appeal is and
how to achieve it successfully, we
went out and interviewed several
innocent and complacent bystand-
ers-—-namely some Pitt students.

Dave Reisberg, after losing an
argument with a coin telephone
over a nickel, told us, “I like a
girl who is witty, charming, and
appreciates the ‘ﬁner things in
life such as colorful and artistic
neckties.” OK Davey, boy‘, OK.

Next, we came across blondish
Marian McCormick busily beating
off seven -PiKA’s' with an old‘ pick
handle. After calling a marshal
to quiet the melee, we asked her
opinion on date appeal, She ex-
,pos'tulated; “I think that a girl
should learn the art of proper
make-up and dress, and be as
good a conversationalist as possi-
.” There you are, chillun’, and
she ain’t just whistlin’ Dixie,
either. '

Postwar Problems
Present Difficulties

Do you know of any vacant
houses or apartments? War veter-
ans coming back to Allegheny
County are desperately seeking
living quarters for their families.
And we hardly need =to mention
that the housing situation
“tight.”

So, if you have. or know of any
place, or if you can make room in
your own home for another family,
notify the Veterans Information
Center, a United War Fund-sup-
ported project which aids return-
ed servicemen with many of their
problemxs.

The Veterans Information Cen-
ter, located at 444 Oliver Avenue,
Pittsburgh, is serving as a clear-
ing house for regristration of
available housing. According to
the Center, most veterans are in-
terested in small, unfurnished
houses and apartments in the $40
to $50 -a month rent bracket. Re-
quests are not conﬁned to any one
district, although the majority of
ex-G\I’s want three to ﬁve-room
houses.

Pins and needles are triﬂes in
everyday life in America, but they
play an important role in helping
Nazi-pillaged Holland to resume
normal routine existence. Along
with huge shipments of emer-
gency supplies of food, clothing,
and medicine sent to the distress-
ed people of the Netherlands by
American Relief for Holland,
there are such relatively simple,
but highly essential items as
straight and safety pins, needles,
thread, shoe laces and razor
blades.

Foreign brides of Yanks, now
arriving in this country, often ﬁnd
the Travelers Aid Society coming
to their assistance. -

is

Next, we wandered around
through the tuck shops and gath-
ered in the following bits. of rep-
artee. Kay Dinan said, “I think
date appeal should be applied to
men, too. Personally, I like a man
who is smooth, good-looking, and
wears shoes, too, daa-aaa-aaa!"

Hank Daley told us, “I dislike

glamour girls who have long’,
claw-like ﬁngernails, and leave
lipsti-"ck smudges all over coke
-glasses.” An aiionyinous male

gave us his pet peeve as fol‘ov.-‘s:
“I -hate coeds who act aifezted and
give out with that Oi’!-SO-l_30',“.)ll.l'.'“xlT
air, when the only dates they ever
garner are in the Christmas fruit-
cake.”

So there it is, gals, a quick size--
up on campus opinion on a very
pertinent question. If you disagree
—well, you’ve got a pencil and a
hunk of paper, haven’t you?

A Crystal Ball Proves
It Ain’t Necessarily So

A few years back, Marta H-oop—¢

er had her fortune told—The'
grand .“soo,'thsayer” gazed into his
crysta1'bafl for a few seconds, and
-then blankly looked up at Marta
saying, .“Hmm, there is nothing
here! ,-You will lead a dull, se-
c1uded,.lif§!,?’ Either the crystal, or
the “so__othsay-er” was a little hazey,-
for Méta llooper, now a senior in
the 'C__olleg'e, has probably seen
more pla~c~e"s, and knows more peo-
ple than Inost girls her age.
Wl1s.gh-l'\'/larta was in her teens,
she le“ai'neEl how to ﬂy at Butler
Field. When the war broke out,
Marta became the Administrative
Head of the Civil Air Patrol in
Pittsburgh. But being a “lady of
adventure,” Marta left this job
as soon as she became of age, and
worked for the Army Air Corps
as a civilian. She was stationed
at Langley Field with the 13th
Tow-Target Squadron; her job
was to tow the targets that were
attached to her plane -by long
ropes, and used in practice train-
ing bythe anti-aircraft battalions
———and the trainees used live am-
munition! «Shortly after Mata left
her job, with the squandron, this
group of women ﬂyers was taken
over by Jackie Cochran, and be-
ca-me pa-rt of the famed WAFS.

After the war was over, it look-
ed like Marta Was doomed to a
dull life. »But an adventurous for-
tune smiled upon her once again,
when she met Olga de Iol. Olga
lived with her Russian parents in
Mexico; and on her visit to Pitts-
burgh, met Marta and pursuaded
her to go to Mexico for a “rest-
ful vacation.” Marta consented
an-d they boarded a plane for
Kansas City. When they arrived,
they«.feun.d they could not get im-
mediate passage to ‘Mexico, so
they detoured to California.

The girls stay-ed in San Fran-
cisco’s‘fam-ed Hollywood Roose-
velt Hotel. During their few weeks
stay there, they visited the Brown
Derby, The Mocombo, and Las
Corn/iques. ‘Manta and Olga, who

speaks Russian ﬂuently, had an

Marta Haoper

enjoyable tirne lunching at the
Romanoff Restaurant.

One of their most exciting days
was spent on the RKO lot. Marta,
who is a personal friend of David
Selznick, was given tickets and
a special .g_uide by the [big pro-
ducer himself. They saw Francis
Langford gmaking her latest pic-
ture “Barnboo Blond.” They met
Gregory Peck, and described him
as looking »more like a “grease
mechanic,” than a “hubba-huib'ba”
screen idol.;They were not im-
pressed by Vivian Leigh’s looks;
she wa-s ;very small and sharp
featured. 2‘ They described Bing
Crosby and Gene Autrey as the
best liked stars in I-lollyw-ood.
Their ﬁnal treat came, when they
got a glimpse of Shirley Temple
and John Agar coming out of the
church on their wedding day.

The two ﬁnally got to Mexico,
and spent another few weeks
there. On their trip home, Olga
and Marta ‘again ran into adven-
ture. They drove -1,300 miles to
Pittsburgh, via the northern U.S.

Seems ev-eryone’s saving their
strength and energy for Christ-
mas . . . the lull before the storm.

But not all is quiet on the social
front. Have you heard the Zeta’s
talking enthusiastically about the
bowling party given for them by
the Delta Sib’s? _ n.

In fact something’s happening
today. The TPA’s are hayiirig a tea
dance for the Sigma Chi’s and not
long after you have read,”r.his, the
AEPhi’s will be having dinner
to honor Annette ‘Silver, and Shir-
ley -Cohen, a pledge. Wedding bells
are ringing for Annette. Wedding
bells and showers,_too, for Gene
Larson McBride. Phi Mu’s 7 show-
ered her November 26. The Phi
Mu’s are also busy with plans for
a Christmas formal.’ ,»,.

Guess what happened to Pene-
lope? Just go to any Theta and
ask her -about the “dinner she had
at Dick Jones’ house on the 27th.
Another preview of the coming
attractions because itseems Thet-a’s
are planning a semi-formal candle
light dance for Christmas, too.

The Chi 0's were so pleased
with the dessert -dean-ce given in
their honor by the .S~AE’s that
they’re reciprocating and having
the SAE’s over f'or some more
dessert and dancing on December
4. There will be a new face at
the dance. Eunice Bowman has
just affiliated with Chi O-’s at Pitt.
Eunice was originally from West-
minister.

December will be a busy month
for the Ka.ppa’s and a gay one for
the Delta and SAE’s. ‘The Kappa’s
will entertain both fraternities at
dances. Watch those corns!

The Tri Delts had a big picnic
dance at the Community House
in South Park. The success was
as big as the picnic . . . no ants,
no ﬁys, just lots of fun. They also
enjoyed themselves at their Foun-
ders Day Banquet held at the
College Club on the 28th.

The Beta Sigs national presi-
dent, Mrs. Georgia Sherribec-k, vis-
ited the local chapter this week,
and was entertained at a dinner

Nope, just IF Council. The recent

The Phi Delts house-partied
after a meeting of their district
representatives last Saturday. The

with a banquet and a dance at
Webster Hall the same evening.

A.nd yet another Sweetheart of
Sigma Chi. This round it’s Kath-

mitted her -picture to the national

While the Sigma Chis (how did
they get in again) and the S.AEs
connived hell week -last week, the
PiKAs start today with the end in
sight on Sunday.

‘Two more candidates‘ for the

Gams at a stag last Friday.

The Delt pledges got pledged,
but good last Saturday. The Bow-

a more refined note, the Phi Kaps
will settle for a pledge dance on
Saturday.

Ah, gentlemen at last. The SAES
entertained the Chi Os at a dessert
bridge last Thursday and the Phi
Kaps had. open house for the Delta
Zetas on Monday‘. And! today the
Phi Gams will be guests at the

Among these are mechanical pole-hole diggers and

Most sports fans are quite familiar with the names of leading

a very common thing today." However, as in most cases there are a
few individuals who work as hard as the head coaches but receive

‘the six-foot mark.

battled a powerful U.S.C. team in
a game that had thrills which will
be remembered‘ for years to come.

Utilizing the excellent experi-
ence that they have acquired
through playing ball, Hoel, Hart-
wig and Oleen have found satis-
faction in passing the knowledge
down to Pitt’s present day play-
ers. Their brilliance will be Pitt’s
brillance and their mistakes will
not occur again for these coa-ches

thing ‘that they have accumulated
in the past ten years.

And of the
other three, probably only one will
be in the starting lineup, which
goes 6-1 per man.

That would be Nate Apple, the
5-81/2 mite from Ford City who
will share captain duties with the
other extreme of the Panthers’ first
line. Hank Zeller, who stands 6-
31,-’ . Both Apple, a forward, and
Zeller, the center, grabbed berths
on the All-District team for 1944-5.
Between them, Apple and Zeller-
who donned Panther ﬂoor togs last
year after two terms at Wash-Jeff
-——carry ﬁve years of college ex-
perience.

Pairing with Apple at forward
may be the youngest member of
Carlson’s cage combo, Slammin’
Sammy David, 17-year-old frosh
ﬂash from Bridgeville who goes
6-1/é.

Two big reasons why Pitt’s
pseudonym — Skyscraper U.—wil1
ﬁnd added circulation’ this year
can be found at the guard posts,
held down by Ed Maruzewski and
Alex Medich. Both sentinels
measure 6-2.

Ready to plug any leaks which
might break out will be the three
other vets, Sam Cosentino, the
Avalon Ace; Jake Jacobson, 6-1
pivotman from Westﬁeld, Pa., and
Ed Garnham, the South Hills
product who hits the 6-2 mark.

Others who may see action
against the Bucks are Norm Boro-
wicz, John Gennock, Pat Malarkey,
Guido Santangelo, and Jim Wil-
liams, all of whom are freshmen;

Joe Haller, a sophomore; and Ev-,

erett Stewart, a junior.

However, as many upstairs men’
as Pitt has, even its tallest will‘
have to take a back seat in mat-_.

ters of height to Olsen’s most

elongated operator—Arnold Risen,
at 6-9 one of the country’s biggest .

basketeers.

Risen, a familiar ﬁgure on most;
of the All-American quints fab-A
ricated last season, reeled off dou- -

ble-ﬁgure scoring efforts with ro-
bot regularity, pacing the Bucks
to 14 wins in 18 starts to give them;
the District Four nod in the NCAA
tourney.

Back from that outﬁt besides
Risen, a junior in his third year
as a regular, is Warren Amling,’

Sports Editor

With the 1945 football season gone but not forgotten we step
into the ’45 basketball campaign. The game on Saturday inaugurating
the season at Ohio State ﬁnds both coaches in their 24th season of
coaching. This game not only begins Carlson’s 24th year but will also
tell the story of this year’s team. Little is known about the boys,

only that they are older than in the past years and that there are a

few individual stars on the squad.

ing aggrega'tion—Carlson has ae

winner otherwise anything might
happen. Saturday night will tell.
North-South Game

Last year George Ranii, Pitt vet-
eran guard, received an invitation
to play on the East squad in the
annual Shrine game in San Fran-
cisco This year George has ac-
cepted an invitation for the North-
South game and has gladly accept-
ed along with Fran Mattioli. For
playing in the game the boy-s re-
ceive the following: Blue and Gray
leat-her coat, $50.00 expense
money, dances and passes to all
movies plus transporrtion, room
and board. George received a wrist
watch for ‘participating in the
Shrine game.

Brainbridge Drops

Last Tuesday evening Brain-
Bridge Naval Academy notiﬁed
Mr. Hagan that they would be un-
able to play Pitt basketball as
previously announced, this brought
our schedule to 14 games two more
than last season. In order to fill
this gap negotiations are being
carried on with Norfolk Navy to

If they mold into a smooth work-

play.,a game on a home and ho.me
basis. In all probability Norfolk
and Pitt will agree.

Pitt Talk

Thursday night, December 20
has Pitt playing -Geneva on the
Stadium floor. This so called gym
is a poor replica of a college gym-
nasium. Everyone realizes that
Pitt needs. a new gymnasium and
we grant you at the present it is
impossible to build a new one.
What we students would like to
know is why isn’t there heat in the
present gym. why aren’t the win-
dows repaired and ﬁnally why
arent the leaks ﬁxed?

‘The second question — Where
will the track team practice‘? The
t1‘?lC‘{ house is in need of repair
and because it will be torn down
in the near future nothing will be
done to it, that leaves Olson’s
team no place to practice.

Will the Pitt footballers .‘-'.::':e a
banquet? The proper authorities
know about it and if they see eye
to eye with the students, who be--
lieve the boys deserve one—maybe
they will get it. Here’s hoping.

VVAA Cage Schedule Changed

Since the turnout for the volleyball tournament has not been as
good as was expected, it has been suggested that the time schedule
for the basketball tournament be changed.

Basketball, due to begin immediately after the Christmas vaca-

tion. would be played the fourthe

hour, 11:30 o’clock, every Tues-
day and Thursday. The present
schedule for volleyball calls for
games on Monday, 3:30 o’clock,

PiKA’s Defeat

Phi Kaps For

IF Grid Lead

The PiK.A’s virtually clinched
the IF football championship by
downing the undefeated Phi Kap-
pa’s 24-6. Sparked by their three
mainstays--Gallagher, Wood, and
Maxim; the PiKA’s were able to
take a 12-0 lead at halftime. In
the third quarter the Phi Kapp’s
narrowed the margin when Billy
Boyd highlighted a passing attack
which resulted in a Phi Kappa
score. From this point on it was
all PiKA. Jack Maxim shot a bul-
let pass to Wood in the flat, who
reversed his ﬁeld twice and ﬁnally
outraced two defenders to score.
Gallagher set up the ﬁnal PiKA
score -by intercepting a despera-
tion pass and returning it deep
‘into Phi Kappa -territory. Should
«the PiKA’s win their remaining
postponed games, there is no
chance of any team ousting them
from the league leadership.

The Phi Delt’s tasted defeat for
the first time by  to the Phi
I{app’;~; 6-2. It was a hotly con-
tested game and gave the Phi
Kapp’s hopes of capturing the

league title previous to the PiKA
game.

In oth_er games played around
the circuit, Pi Lambda Phi broke
into the victory column by down-
ing the l-owly Delt’s 12-0.

Statistics Show
Panthers Did Well

By Al Roth
Total statistics on the Pitt grid season just completed show the
Panthers to be slightly behind their opponents in statistical compari-
sons. However the numerical story relates very little of the failures
or accomplishments of the 1945 Pittmen, because of the extremes in

strength of the enemy elevens en-9
countered. Any statistical drub-

   
    
 

bings that were inflicted upon the
Panthers by some of their power-
house opponents have been erased
by overwhelming margins acquired
by the locals in battles with out-
classed foes.

Perhaps, most outstanding in the
list of ﬁgures is the number of
penalties inflicted on the Pittites
this fall. The Cats were penalized
a total of 79 times with a loss in
yardage of 604, more than one-half
the amount of distance amassed by
the Blue and Gold in rushing
plays. Pittsburgh opponents were

charged with only 34 infractions
for 254 yards. The Panther pass-
ing aitacl; was on equal footing
with that of opponents, the locals
having a 36 per cent copletage
average and the combined toe
with a 34 per cent record.

6-1 guard whose court lithographs
have a higher priority than his
grid reputation.

At the other guard will be Paul
Huston, who, like Risen, in in his
third year as a regular. Huston,
6-3, was good ‘enough to make the
second five of the All-Big 10 team.

Ray Snyder, smallest of the reg-
ulars at a mere 5-1'0, will start at
forward with either Bob Bowen,
6-1, or Wayne Wells, 5-11. Sny-
der and Bowen are seniors, the
former having three years’ ex-
perience as a sub and the latter
having played two years ago. He
was ineligible last year as a Navy
Dental student. This is the ﬁrst
year for Wells, a sophomore.

Medical Aptitude Tests
Given December 14

A medical aptitude test will be
given on Friday, December 14, at
3 o’clock in room G-24 for all
pre-med students who intend to
enter medical school in 1946.

According to instructions issued
by the association of American
Medical Colleges, this test is im-
portant because it has been adopt-
ed by the association as one of the
normal requirements for admis-
sion.

A fee of $2.00 must be paid by
each student before taking the
exam. This fee is to be paid at
the treasurer’s office, and the re-
ceipt will be used as a card of ad-
mission to the examination.

pearing ﬂowers are creamy white
and pea-shaped. The dark-green

are located on the Bellefield and
