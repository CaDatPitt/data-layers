PITT ENDS ARE WEAK

Squad Departs Early Today
For Ohio Encounter;
Students Aroused

By Campus Scout “T"

A year or so ago Green Pas-
tures had its ﬁrst nighter. Re-
cently, Anthony Adverse had its
first nighter. Tomorrow, out on
the ﬂats of Ohio in Columbus, a
powerful Panther football team
and a mighty ‘Ohio State eleven
will go through with their ﬁrst
nighter, an ‘attraction that will
see one of the season’s largest
box-oﬂice results, when 80,000
odd fans jam into the Buckeye
stadium to watch these two na-
tional title-contending outﬁts.

Finished with the small road tours,
that made the Sutherland-directed
troupe a “hit” with Ohio Wesleyan
and West Virginia, and the Schmidt-
directed actors highly successful in
their l-one showing against NYU, the
two troupes have only 24 hours to
wait until curtain time at 2 o’clock
tomorrow afternoon.

To Have Box Seats

All the Brouns, the Seidels, of the
sports world will have box seats at
tomorrow’s productions. The critics
are in to decide which of the two
shows, the Panther or the Buckeye,
will go down into history as an epic,
the -other as merely a good show.

Stars 0'" the coming attraction are
literally sprinkled throughout both
casts. On the Panther end are 11,
leading players, including Marshall
Goldberg, Frank Patrick, Frank Sou-
chak, Tony Matisi, Leo Malarkey and
a host -of others. Schmidt has chosen
for his leads Emerson Wendt, Tippy
Dye, Bill Booth, and Jumpin’ Joe Wil-
liams. And when these two conﬂict-
ing casts get together on the sam-e
stage, th-e action begins to resemble
another musical production of a few
years ago, “Anything Can Happen.”
And it probably will.

Tomorrow’s game in Columbus
looms as t‘ biggest and most im-
portant game in the country. Two
powerful, fast, experienced elevens,

Trip To Columbus
Routed By AAA

For students driving to Colum-
bus today or tomorrow, the Ameri-
can Automobile Association fur-
nishes the following route:

Follow U. 5. Route 22 over the
Point Bridge, through Crafton,
Steubenville, Cadiz, and Cam-
bridge (Ohio). Hit U. S. Route
40 at Cambridge through Zanes-
ville, thence directly to Columbus.
Although the road is good all the
way, the AAA recommends mod-
erate speed and great care because
of the heavy traffic likely to be
encountered. “Go especially slow
just beyond Cadiz (Ohio), for the
little town of Piedmont (Ohio) is
a notorious speed trap. The entire
trip is 189 miles long and because
of the heavy traffic should take
from ﬁve to six hours."

Personnel
Revisions
Announced

Seidle, Barton Promoted;
Corley Appointed New
Assistant To Dean

Three changes in the University’s
administrative personnel were an-
nounced yesterday by Dr. Vincent
W. Lanfear, dean of men. J. Clyde
Barton, former director of the Men’s
Placement Bureau, has assumed the
duties of Purchasing Agent f-or the
University.

N. Robert Seidle, who for the past
two years has been director of the
Men’s Housing Bureau and has been
handling men’s fraternities, has taken
over the former duties of Mr. Barton
as Placement Bureau director.

Robert R. Corley is the new mem-
ber of the Dean of Men’s office and
will carry on the work of Mr. Seidle.
Mr. Corley took his Master’s Degree
in 1934 at the University. He was
graduated from Bethany College in
1932. There he was active in the
Interfraternity Council, and was man-
ager of the Sigma Nu fraternity.

Mr. Barton, who became director
of the Placement Bureau when it was
founded in October, 1933, has guided

it through the last three years of ex-,

pansion. During that time he has
placed 779 graduates of the Univer-
sity. From October, 1933, to June,
1934, 86 men were placed. During
the next year, he placed 236 men, and
during the period from July, 1935
to June, 1936, the Bureau sent 305
graduates to the companies where
they are now employed. I

Graduated from the School of
Business Administration in 1932, Mr.
Barton won the George Wharton
Pepper prize, and was a member of
ODK, Druids, and Kappa Sigma.

Theodore Grapp, who for the last
eight years has been the University
purchasing agent, resigned from his
position September 1. 3

Mr. Seidle, IE31, is a member of
Omicron Delta Kappa, Theta Chi and
Sigma Tau fraternities. He is also a
member of the Druids.

 

Panther Conducts Poll

The Pitt Panther will conduct a
presidential poll during the ﬁrst few
minutes of the second hour today.
The votes will be taken by 75 stu-
dent, aides, and the results will be.

adee, Doris Petric, in the University

ever fun!

Dipping around the ball room to

ﬁlmy summer formals and the upper-

class women in their sundry relatives’ - - -

various clothes. Numerous tuxedoes,
sports jackets, polka dot and striped
ties, polo shirts, red striped socks,
and whatnot ﬂourished. (Of course,
this is all ﬁrst-hand information on

Ohio State Sports Editor Sees
Close Panther, Buckeye Battle

Predicts Pitt Game Turning
Point In State Season;
Williams Replaced

By Dick Williams
Lantern Sports Editor
Ohio State University

With the eyes of the nation fo-
cused on the meeting between Ohio
State and Pittsburgh Saturday after-
noon, a capacity crowd of 80,000 is
expected to jam the great Ohio sta-
dium for the red-letter football event
of the season, and deﬁnitely the most
important on the Buck schedule.

It will mark the meeting of two
powerful and evenly matched teams,
both eligible for national champion-
ship honors. Victory will mean the
advancement of one team’s hopes,
while loss will do much to shatter the
successful season of the other.

Newsreel cameramen from every
major studio, eastern sportswriters
including Grantland Rice, and numer-
ous radio commentators will be on

‘ hand for the fourth meeting of the

Scarlet and the Panthers.‘

While Pittsburgh is expected to re-
ly on a relentless powerhouse drive,
the Bucks will attempt the fast open-
ﬁeld running, forward passes, unex-
pected laterals, and varied‘ attack
which has characterized their offense
ever since Coach Francis A. Schmidt
took charge.

Several changes have been made in
the Scarlet line-up from that wh_ich
opened the game with N.Y.U. Charles
Gales, regular right tackle, is out with
a knee injury and Alex Schoenbaum,

Dean Announces
Card Distribution

Identiﬁcation cards for all stu-
dents will be distributed Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday of next
week, according to an announcement
from the office of Dr. Vincent W.
Lanfear, dean of men.

Commenting on the new identiﬁ-
cation system, Dr. Lanfear said:
“Now the students can have a truly
student section at athletic events, and
a truly student night at such affairs
as Cap and Gown and other activi-
ties where a student book is re-
quired. Students are urged to keep
their cards with them at all times,
both this semester and next semes-
ter, since no new cards will be issued
the second semester.”

The card, together with the stu-
dent book, will be required for ad-
mission to all student activity events

where the student book is required. A

Pitt’s top-ranking, at least in the
East, has been tagged as a pre-season
certainty. Virtually the same with
even more gusto can be said about the
scarlet hurricane from the ﬂats on
the eastern rim of the mid-west. Ohio
State supremacy in the Big-Ten is
said to be threatened only by Bernie
Bierman’s hole-ripping Gophers.

And Then There's Pitt!

It is, therefore, quite a surprise to
learn that there are very, very few
of the ranking trainers under the
Big-Top who choose to cast at least
a split-nod in the direction of the
Panther cage. There are few Buck-
passers in the Big Show.

Just why they fail to recall a late
November Saturday as different or
distinct from any other can be ex-
plained simply “just one of those
things.” Most people do remember
that on that particular week-end an
inspired Tartan eleven tied the tail
of an unwary Panther, 0-0. This was
unpredicted. But more important was
the complete collapse of an unde-
feated New York U balloon by the
infamously deadlocked and Vander-
built-spilled Fordham Ram.

A Shrinking Violet

That was just a sample bleaching
of what was to happen to the Violet;
for last week Columbus made the
Empire Staters, minus an unhealthy
graduation loss, forget all about
1492 and Rameses II with a 60-0 en-
try in the nation’s sport ledger. Why
that victory, therefore, was labeled so
startling is diﬂicult for a Pitt rooter,
at least, to see. For the Cathedral
ball team should rate an excellent
chance of coming through in this pre-
mature oifspring of the 1936 season
if just their ﬁrst two scores of 1936
are recalled—Ohio Wesleyan, 0-53;
West Virginia, 0-34.

Early in September, Coach Francis
Schmidt, of the Buckeyes, passed over
the Pitt games much like the late
Knute Rockne in regard to Carnegie
Tech some years ago. This was be-
fore the time when, while the Great
Rock scouted in the shadows of the
Navy bowl, Assistant Coach Hunk
Anderson’s grip on the throttle of the
Irish express was smashed by a 19-0
Twentieth Century Tartan limited
that missed the switch and disrupted
the entire Intercollegiate line.

Mr. Schmidt will not make pre-
cisely the same mistake, but he feels
much like the Irish leader of many
seasons ago. Pitt fans hope he may
take similar medicine from a “frying
pan” position on the State bench.

While he has predicted victory by
several touchdowns, Pittsburgh's

Faculty, Deans, Secretary
Compile “Dope” Sheet

By Mel Rogow

Jock Sutherland’s football team
must win that ball game tomorrow
if they want to uphold the reputation
of the University faculty as prognos-
ticators.

Almost to a man the faculty likes
the Panther chances against the
Buckeye powerhouse. Most of the
men interviewed called the score at
about 13-7, Pitt.

Dr. Omar C. Held, assistant dean
of the College, hopes Pitt will win
at about 50 to 0, but thinks the
breaks will decide the game. “It’s
a toss-up,” he said.

Bill Daufenbach, assistant to the
dean of men, was far more optim-
istic. “Pitt will smash right through
with a 14-7 win,” he said.

John W. Hallock, secretary of the
Alumni Association, said he was a lit-

time today or Mon-day.

Women Pick Home Eleven
To Defeat State 13-12

By Charlotte Atwell

They may not know a touchback
or a forward pass from a lateral, but
the women of the University are per-
fectly willing to predict the winner
of tomorrow’s big game.

With one exception, they were
loyal to the home team in their
guesses about the outcome. The only
“traitor” was Jean Barnes, C38, who
sounded a bit pessimistic when she
said: “I think Ohio State will win,
partly because I think so, and partly
because I have a bet on Pitt. I al-
ways lose my bets.” So perhaps Miss
Barnes is more loyal than she pre-
dicts.

We aren’t quite sure what she
meant, but Mrs. Ruth Smelscer thinks
that Pitt will win because, “Pitts-
burghers are faster workers than
Ohioans.” And Mrs. Ruth Cubbison,

 To Columbus

‘ITT FOOTBALL, in fact all Pitt, points its compass needle

due west tomorrow in the direction of Columbus. During the aft-
ernoon there is much to be discovered. Dr. Sutherland’s squad will
take over the bulk of the discovering assignments, and if it is able
to claim possession we have much to gain.

If Coach Schmidt’s boys are successful, then we have much to
lose. But we have lost: before and a defeat tomorrow would prove
little more than the fact that a Pitt drive for national football su-
premacy would have possibly been side-tracked and that Ohio
State would have earned the inside track for that same title drive.

The situation is a rare one in Pitt: football, with the Panther
team a decided under-dog in the scrap. This, however, shapes up
as a not too unhealthy condition, which may prove to be the de-
ciding factor in the ultimate outcome. Pitt football has been con-
sistently good. The chances are it will always remain that way,
conditions remaining relatively as they are today.

For these things, the University is known the country over.
Therefore we can feel justly proud to take part in the Pittsburgh
migration west for the week-end. There is one thing a bit more
vital, however, than winning or losing a ball game. That item
looms up quite startlingly at times, but is usually quite easily

forgotten. .
Something VI’ral

LAST YEAR, previous to the Fordham game, two students were
"killed en route to South Bend. In 1934, a similar occurrence cast
an unhappy sidelight on the Navy game at Annapolis. Such things
are vital, and no football game in the world is worth such horrible
results. Students must drive carefully and sanely on the open
highway. Especially is this important for the approaching Co-
lurnbus event, for the roads open straight ahead, and the oppor-
tunity for a speedway is there.

Intelligent people, however, do not take their lives and others’
in their hands by racing madly ahead. The extremes are deﬁnitely
not worth the means.

So, start early in plenty of time. Only careful, intelligent
driving Will lead to one of the ﬁnest football games in the world.
After all, it is a pretty good place at that, this world, we mean.

Do not exceed the speed limit that you honestly believe, and
what others agree, promotes safety.

Watch passing of automobiles ahead, for you can never de-
termine just how crazy or reckless the man coming in the opposite
direction may be.

And last, do not load cars with more persons than prescribed
by law. That is, three persons in the front seat or three persons
in the back seat is the capacity of any machine.

With this in mind, go forth to Columbus with the certainty
that there will be plenty of Pitt “Sock it to ’em” there to give the
Buckeyes one of the toughest battles in history.

That Identification Business

ND NOW comes the announcement that at ﬁrst glance affects

most students quite the wrong way. An identiﬁcation system
to curb the illegal passage of student books will put many of us
in an anything but a friendly mood for quite some time. The new
project goes quite a bit further, however, than merely curbing a
“student racket.”

A Pitt cheering section may now become a reality. Where
brothers, cousins, men of the street, and unknowns formerly spent
October Saturdays there should now be a strictly student rooting,
tooting section. One hundred per cent backing of the newly-pro-
posed student block can now be deﬁnitely assured. For a time stu-
dents will miss that extra “three bucks” that was illegally gained
by a student book transfer. We all did it when we knew we could
get away with it.

However, the administration has made a step in the right direc-
tion, a step that will ultimately prove most beneﬁcial and satisfac-
tory. Studcnts who must work Saturdays perhaps may have rea-
son to take the Mike Jacobs attitude “We wuz robbed.” That is
unfortunate. But there is nothing to be done but accept the situa-
tion that is best suited to the majority of students. When you get
right down to the ﬁnal analysis you will discover that one hun-
dred and fifty dollars in tuition each semester brings much more
than that sum represents in actual cash. And it is only when a
student carries less than ﬁfteen credits that the actual ten-clollar
activity fee is additional to the regular ten-dollar per credit charge.

There is so very much included in that tuition fee, exclusive
of actual classroom work that the student is really ahead of the
game, considering only the basic supplies such as three free is-
sues of the student newspaper each week, tickets and participation
in all undergraduate activities ﬁnanced by the University, and a
host of social advantages that would ﬁll pages it listed.

There is just one thin to do. Accept the new arrangement
cheerfully, and ultimately Tr _
not only from an administrative point of view but also from the
student angle.

“Our ground plays will be too
much for Ohio State,” said E. A.
Batcheldel‘, assistant registrar. “Call
it Pitt 13 to 7.” Theodore W, Bid-
dle, ossistant to the dean of men,
picked exactly the same score.

Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men, is “hoping,” N. Robert Seidle,
assistant to the dean of men, likes
Pitt to win via the air lines. He and
Robert Corley, new assistant to the
dean of men, are of the 13-7 school
of thought.

Dr.   Carlson, director of Stu-
dent Health Service, said: “Pitt will
probably win by .13 to 3, at least.
However, we’ll probably run all over
them.’_'’ J. Lloyd Mahony, director of
the Evening Session, belongs to the

of the dean of men’s oﬁice, deﬁes
anybody to give one good reason why
Ohio State should win. “We’ve got
our strongest team in history,” she
declared. “Why shouldn’t we win?”

Supreme conﬁdence is expressed by
Ruth Rosenthal, C38, who says, “I
have ﬁrm faith in our team. They’ll
win, 14'-13.” And Ruth Johnston,
CB9, qualiﬁes lierhstatement, “Pitt
will win, of course,” by adding, “but
I think it will be close.”

Martha Bedsworth, C37, thinks it
will be close, too, naming 13-12 as
her prediction and stating that she
hopes that the fellow in her psych
lab who bet forty dollars on Ohio
State eats beans for the rest of the
year, and very few of them at that.

A little more -conﬁdent is the pre-
diction of Mrs. N. Robert Seidle, who
thinks that ‘Pitt will win by 21-7. At
the end of the game Pitt will be ahead
12-7, according to Jane Thomas, C39,

Schmidt Predicts

unlikely.

 

will not be counted out until the last
whistle. Notre Dame proved that
Ohio State will recognize this quite
memorably, referring the skeptic to a
certain 16-14 ﬁgure of last fall.

One other point, perhaps the larg-
est Pittsburgh pilgrimage in history
advances on the Ohio capital with
10,000 known to be deﬁnitely west-
bound, and several additional hun-
dred likely to pack before many hours
of the morrow have slipped by. Ap-
proximately 50 per cent or better of
this group are estimated to be mem-
bers of the University, both faculty
and student.

You Can't Beat These Bands

If Pitt’s band can show much of
the same stuff exhibited during the
1935 campaign, Ohio State’s famed
160-piece drilling unit will have to
look to its laurels. Drum majors of
both outﬁts should have quite a time
during the mid-period demonstration.

Perhaps the brightest color of the
spectacle will be found right in the
center of the green turf. State’s
bright red or scarlet clashes with the
shiny blue jerseys of Pitt. The Pan-
thers with the exception of the pants
and numerals will be solidly blue,
with blue headgears and shoes. The
pants are bright gold silk, with blue
stripes.

A special Pitt train pulls out of the
Pennsylvania station at 7:30 o’clock
tomorrow morning, carrying the 120-
piece ROTC band and a large Pitt
delegation.

In conclusion, two goal-lines are
yet uncrossed. Ohio has averaged
60 points a game in one game against
a team in one game against a team
that was expected to give the Buck-
eyes a good test. On the other hand,
the Sutherland squad tallied an over-
age of 43 for two games, showing
power and lots of promise. Both
teams have been pointing since book
in last May during spring drills for
this day. Ohio State is conﬁdent, Pitt
determined, and we are sure that
“Anything Can Happen." Pitt hopes
it will happen--the Pitt way.

each with plenty of reserves, each with a Vastly different style of

acting lock horns.

Pitt, long known as a power plant, will put another power
team on the ﬁeld against a more sensational, lateral-throwing,

speedy Buckeye bunch tomorrow.

In such a battle, no one can

go far wrong when they state that anything can happen.

Both teams have come up from last\
fall pre-rated as “great” With ﬁne
chances of taking the mythical na-
tional championship title. In three
previous meetings the ratings stand
all even, the Panthers taking the ﬁrst
game in 1929, 18-2, the Buckeyes
coming back the following year to
win, 16-7, and the last game in 1932
found the count 0-0.

In the ﬁnal two days of practice
Coach Sutherland has made only one
change in the lineup that started
last Saturday against West Virginia.
Johnny Miohelosen will be back in
there at quarterback over Arnold
Greene, who replaced Johnny last
Saturday. That will be the lone
change in the backﬁeld which will
have Bobby LaRue and Marshall
Goldberg at the halves and Frank
Patrick at fullback.

On the line there may be only
one change from last week. That is at
center where Don Hensley might come
into his own again to replace Heinie
Adams. At the ends, the most diffi-
cult posts to keep ﬁlled, will probably
be Bill Dad-dio, sophomore, and veter-
an Frank Souchak. Bomber Shaw,
who was a hoped-for starter, is still
not in condition to play.

Mountaineer Matisi

Tony Matisi and Ave Daniell will
team at the tackles. Tony is the boy
who raced all over and through the
Mountaineer back-ﬁeld. In fact, he
got to be such a ﬁxtur-e in the West
Virginia lineup, that Trusty Tallman,
Mountaineer coach, was going to take
Tony back to Morgantown as one of
the squad.

Two experienced lettermen will be
at the guards, in Biﬁ.“ Glassford and
Dante Dalle Tezze, the lad with the
box oiﬁce attraction name. The entire
line will average 191 pounds, six

wall.

Over in Columbus, Coach Schmi-dt
has enough star players to occupy the
Cathedral ground ﬂoor. Foremost are
the runners in the backﬁeld. Tippy
Dye, a 145-pound halfback, and Bill
Booth, a sophomore sensation, who
weighs 185 pounds, will tear through
the Panther line and around the ends
. . . maybe. Jumpin’ Joe Williams,
the right half, is an all-around back
and was being whispered All—Ameri-
can as early as the ﬁrst game. A
stand-out on the line is Captain
Wendt at end.

Last week in their rout of the NYU
team, the Buckeyes used 55 players
and enough laterals and forwards to

bull-necked sophomore who shone in
the 60 to 0 rout of N.Y.U. will take
Gales’ place, with Charles Ream, un-
derstudy for Charles Hamrick at the
other tackle post, kept in readiness
for action when needed.

Mike Kabealo, fourth of the line of
Kabealo’s at Ohio State, is slated to
start at left halfback in place of
“Jumping Joe” Williams. I

The rest of the line-up is familiar.
Capta-in Wendt and Cumiskey at
ends; Hamrick at left tackle; Smith
and Zarnas at guards; Wolf, center;
Dye, quarterback; Bettridge at right
half, and McDonald at fullback.

The Bucks are well supplied with
backﬁeld stars, and if one unit does
not click, can put in four others just
as versatile and experienced. The sec-
ond backﬁeld quartet includes Bill
Booth, new sophomore star; Nick
Wasylik, who ran 65 yards through
N.Y.U.’s team last week for a touch-
down; the elusive “Jumping Joe”
Williams, and veteran Frank Anten-
nuci, who saw considerable action last
year. ._ -
Expect Tough Battle

The Scarlet line is experienced, ex-
cept at center where Ralph Wolf has
taken the placevof All-American Go-
mer Jones. Inasmuch as Pittsburgh
will also have _a new center, Adams,
the lines seem closely matched.

Fully realizing the potentialities of
the Panther [ eleven, the Bucks enter
the game with the realization they
hold no advantage, and in such de-
partments as punting and power
drives may be at ’a disadvantage. Ka-
bealo and Comiskey are expected to
do the major share of the Buck’s
punt-ing, inasmuch as the ace punter
of the squad, Howard Wedebrook, is
not experienced enough as yet to face
such stiff opposition as P/itt.

In reserve material, both elevens
seem well supplied. Last week
Schmidt used 50 players against
N.Y.U. _

One of the hardest battles in Scar-
let history is expected. The outcome?
Fans on both sides claim a victory.
To us the teams appear so evenly bal-
anced that we make no rash predic-
tions. We do know that the entire
Buck squad have pointed for this bat-
tle, because they know it is the cru-

cial, deciding game for them.

disturb the air currents over here in
Pittsburgh. State is exceptionally
dangeroius on the short ﬂat-zone
passes whipped across by Tippy Dye,
who has to get rid of that ball quick
before an opponent grabs his 145
pounds

Two-thirds of the Buckeye yard-
age was gained through passes. If
Pitt has fallen down on the pass de-
fense since last week, the referee
really should offer to arm the Pan-
ther backs with tennis rackets or
mosquito nets to stop one or two of
the State passes.

10,000 Tickets Sold Here

All the seats that were sent to the
Stadium Ticket Ofﬁce from Colum-
bus, a total of 8,000, have been sold
since last Tuesday. Several thousand
other tickets have been received by
telegraph from the Buckeye offices in
Columbus for Pittsburghers. Special
trains on the Pennsylvania line will
leave Pittsburgh early tomorrow
morning for the game.

On the betting side of the State-
Pitt game, things seem to be quite
successful also. Ohio State, in the
majority of cases, is the favorite with
odds ranging from ﬁve to four and
as high as three to one.

The Sutherland football troupe
left the Pennsylvania station at 9:20
this morning. After the game the
boys will make the trip back to Pitts-
burgh, win or lose, on the 6:30 p. m.
special.

With the stage set for action, Pitts-
burgh waits . . . and Ohio State wai-ts
. . . so do Duquesne, Notre Dame,
Fordham, Penn State, Nebraska, and
Carnegie Tech.

Olson Ballyhoos
‘Bigger, Better’
Novice Meeting

By Leonard Levison

When the tape is broken for the
last time in the all-University track
and ﬁeld meet, scheduled for Wed-
nesday and Thursday of next week,
October 14 and 15, novices will be
novices no longer. They will have
had one “big-time” track meet un-
derneath their spiked shoes.

From the practice classes that Carl
Olson, varsity track coach, has been
sending the uninitiated cinderers

through, it seems that O1son’s “show” '

this year will be bigger and better
than ever before. It will be bigger
in the way of entries. Olson ex-
pects to have as many entries in as
there are yards in a 100-yard dash.
It will be better, if the enthusiasm
of the performers as already evi-
denced can be considered the accurate
method of gauging it.

The prospective record breakers
are still going through a thorough
warming-up process. These drills
consist either of a jaunt through
the wooded slopes of yon Schenley
Park or an afternoon of strides
around the cinders that border the
edge of the Stadium.

. Weight interest is going upwards.
Charley Gongloﬂ,’ wI1o,'in' his under-
graduate days tossed ‘a mean jave-
lin, and won the national collegiate
title with a heave of 221 feet, is put-
ting in time with the weight boys.
He has about a dozen or so proteges
reporting for the daily session.

Transfer Torn Between Two
Alma. Maters——Almostl

 

 

By Muriel Rosenbluxn

Yes, I'm on the spot! I've just
transferred to Pitt from Ohio State
University and my friends hora are ‘
already asking me how I feel in
regard to the approaching Pith ‘
Ohio State game. “Kind of funny”
is the best way I can describe it.

Good old Ohio State. The team
is really great! I know because I
watched it for two years. (Just
skip that Notre Dame game). Lit-
tle Jumpin’ Joe Williams was my
special ‘friend on the team. That
boy was some worker, but so were
the rest of them. Hard goon, every
last one of them. Geo, it would be
a- shame if they lost any games A

V this year. '

On the other hand,_tlIougb, Pitt
is my Alma Mater now. I don't,
know what the team is Iilte because
I never saw them play, but I hear
they're good, too. At least, that's
what everyone at Pitt is telling me.

How do I' feel about this all-im-
portant situation? Well, quite hon-
°8_tlY. I want to see “our" team
win. An innoculution of “Pitt
8Pil'if" seems to have bitten me.
So . ON TO COLUMBUS, Pitt,
and show Ohio State how it's done!

ment to all entrants ordering that
remaining ﬁrst-round matches be
played off as soon as the weather and
time permit. The date for the ﬁnals
has been indeﬁnitely postponed.

MEETINGS TO FOLLOW

A meeting of College fresh-
men with their faculty advisers
will take place today from 12 :30
to 1 o’clock. Those students who
have not received a notice of the
meeting should report to the
College office. 205 State Hall.

Through such conferences, Dr.
Omar C. Held, personnel assistant to
the dean of the College, hopes to
remedy the lack of personal contacts
between students and their instruc-
tors that is s-o typical of large uni-
versities. Human relations can be
established just as well in a large as
in a small college, he states.

Forty-ﬁve faculty members are to
act as freshmen advisers, each to be
in charge of 15 students. Whenever
possible, m-en will be assigned to pro-
fessors whom they have in class.
Prior to today’s meeting, advisers will
receive a copy of each student’s pre-
vious record.

At least two other meetings will
be scheduled during the year, one to
follow the issuing of the eight weeks’
grades and another in the spring to
decide upon sophomore schedules.

Freshman women are already meet-
ing weekly their orientation instruc-
tors under the supervision of Miss
Thyrsa W. Amos, Dean of Women.
Eight orientation professors are to
effect a personal relationship with
ﬁrst-year women students.

A.ccording to Dr. Held, this is
merely the ﬁrst step toward a better
cooperation between students and
faculty. Since it is impossible for him
to interview frequently 600 freshman
men, he hopes to establish contact
through his representatives.

presented a program. Audrey Gra-
ham, president of WAA, spoke words
of welcome to the dancers, and espe-
cially to the freshman women,
through a microphone that squawked.
Miss Graham introduced Virginia
Boyd, ﬁrst vice president of WAA;
Betty Cox, second vice president and
sports chairman; Marion Lee Patter-
son, secretary; and Louise Baugh-
man, treasurer. First on the program
was Mary V. Kunkle, who tappe-d in
a white coat, dark trousers, and an
unique hat.

Then Marian Werner sang “Star-
dust” an-d was followed by Beverly
Childress, who sang and danced to
“Until the Real Thing Come-s Along.”
June Greene danced in a white frock
and looked as though she was really
dancing on the village Greene
in June. The program was concluded
with Annabelle Knupp singing “The
S-tars Come Out At Night.”

Everyone snuk up several times on
the man With the punch. We took
our moustache (which tickled our
nose and half of which we had swal-
lowed) off every other time we went
up to the punch bowl in disguise so
that the man wou1dn’t recognize us.
We also asked him for the ice cube
that was about 10 inches square.
But we were given a frigid glance
that froze us to the ﬂoor.

After braving the onslaught of
gentlemen at the checkroom, we
ﬁnally edged our way i-n and got our
chickadee’s evening wrap, Wrapped
her up in it, relieved our sagging
pockets of sundry articles, and took
her home. Thus endeth another swell
Coed Prom!

Corley Takes Over Seidle’s
Duties As Greeks Hold
Opening Conclave

With the advent of rushing season
Monday, fraternity men were at a
state! of high tension as I-F Council
met for the ﬁrst time Tuesday eve-
ning at the Pi Kappa Alpha House.

But while rushing season remained
as a shadow behind the horizon, other
developments made Council’s initial
meeting one of‘ importance.

It was the ﬁrst meeting for new
Fraternity Adviser Robert Corley, as-
sistant to the dean of men, who is
taking over the fraternity duties of
N. Robert Seidle, former assistant to
the dean of men.

Next was the appointment by
Harry Zinsser, Med39, president, and
his executive committee, of Ben Bas-
kin, C37, Sigma Alpha Mu, as chair-

kin, Theta Chi, selected "Charles Man-
terﬁeld, C37, as his business manager.

Plans for the big Greek formal are
already in a stage which Baskin terms
“more than tentative.” According to
present intentions, the I-F Ball will
have “the biggest name band ever to
play for a University dance.” Bas-
kin hints at such names as Benny
Goodman, Glen Gray and‘ Fletcher
Henderson. _

To revise the method of electing
oﬁicers, a constitutional point which
raised more than a great deal of con-
ﬂict last April, Zinsser appointed a
new committee. Hubert Teitelbaum,
C37, Phi Epsilon Pi, is chairman, and
other members are John Glasser,
BA38, Delta Tau Delta, and Mantel‘-
ﬁeld.

Glasser was chosen by Delta Tau
Delta to replace Samuel Werlinich,
BA38, as its junior representative.
I-F Council will meet next on Novem-
ber 3.

In introducing this column on

campus, the editor-shopper wants to

explain to all the clothes-conscious
bits of feminity that the shops whose
apparel we advertise, is moder-
ately priced for the average college
girl. The merchandise in these shops
has been selected because of its sim-
plicity, quality, and moderate cost.
So-o, take a tip from one who has
shopped, and stop, look, and read be-
fore you buy.

the hair any way you prefer, they
do one swell job of shampooing.

All this eflicient service plus
modern atmosphere costs no more
than 35 and 50 cents—the manicures
are 50 and the shampoos and waves

The correct hat to partially cover
those ringlets can be found at the
Ann Hat Shop at 208 Oliver Avenue.
By no means is this just another
shop. The hats sold here have that
certain “umph” so characteristic of
all smart and individualistic hats.
Whether it be two or ﬁfteen dollars
that you spend, whether it be felt,
velour or velvet, it most certainly
will not be just another casual hat.

If a college graduate doesn’t know
style, then who should? You may
have guessed it, it’s Rose Margolis
Sugarman, C26, who owns the Adrian
Dress Shop at 505 Smithﬁeld Street,
just opposite the Mellon Bank. For
you small, petite things, Adrian car-
ries size nine and for all girls weigh-
ing over 95 pounds Adrian carries
dresses, formals, and costume suits
up to size 20. These puhlenty smooth
dresses carry tags from $10.95 and
up, and these dresses are puhlenty
smooth.

Whether it be dancing at the Chat-

‘-four lrist year’s evening shoes won’t
do once you see these new toeless
evening sandals, just arrived at Nis-

are not extreme, since the backs of
the sandals are not cut out.

feet -— toeless sandals. The Conti-
nental Louis heel is not the high spike
that so nicely rips off your escort’s
trouser cuff and so painfully digs
into your foot along about one A. M.
Not these sensible heels! Ifyou pre-
fer satin to silver or gold kid, -you
can have the satin tinted to match
your new Coronation red or blue for-
mal. If not, the gold or silver kid
will blend with any of your formals.
The price for this bit of flattery is
not the total of your lab fees, but
merely $4.95 for the satin trimmed
with silver, and $6.00 for the all sil-
ver or gold kid.
__.o__

In the way of further suggestions
the lace mesh stockings at $1.50 and
$1.95 would so nicely protect that
uncovered toe. Remember, the for-
mal season is starting, so take ad-
vantage now while the stock is com-
plete and don’t say I didn't warn
you in advance!

The name of the shop is the Trous-
seau Shop, located at 4010 Fifth Ave-
nue, in the Schenley Apartments.
However, don’t let the name make
any difl’erence to you sweet young
things who aren’t setting THE date.
This lovely shop is owned by a New
York concern that sells intimate ap-
parel designed by French designers.
They carry a ready stock of all lin-
gerie, Mary Dunhill toiletries, Quak-
er hosiery, hankies and other fem-
inine necessities. Even tho you may
still have the pajamas Aunt Eve gave
you, go in and look around—some-
body’s birthday is coming!

Until next week then, good-bye
and good buying.-——Advertisement.
