Frostbite

Cold weather doesn’t bother Mal Weiss.

The freshman resident of Schenley proved‘ it last week
by trotting around the quadrangle in the middle-‘of the night

the cold didn’t bother him, and
the bet was on.

Money was gathered from al-
most every room on the ﬂoor. It
was then decided that Weiss
would collect a dollar for‘ each lap

‘he could run around the quad-

rangle, dressed only in a swim-
suit and sneakers.
Weiss, a member of the fresh-

man squash team, merrily dashed

out to the quadrangle. At 2:30 a.m.

termined to collect the cold cash.

“The first two or three laps
were the hardest,” Weiss reports.
After that, he added, his muscles
became conditioned “to the rather
chilly night air.”

Completing the tenth lap, Weiss
trotted back to his room. He col-
lected his prize money from Larry
Rosenthal, who held the stakes
during the run; and then hopped
into bed where he guzzled‘ tea and
munched aspirins.

Although he managed to avoid
pneumonia, Weiss believes that
he may have contracted frost-
bite in his hand. But as he clutch-
ed his frozen assets in his other
hand, he commented, “Next time
I’ll wear gloves." ~ 7

tor and chief executive officer

uated from the U.S. Military
Academy in 1918. He was com-
missioned 2nd Lieutenant and ad-
vanced through the grades to be-
come general in 1947.

Concert Funds

To Aid Student

A University student will study
in England this summer with
funds raised by eighty majorettes,
and musicians from
Montour Joint High School.

The students, under the direc-
tion of Joseph C. Picchi, conductor
of the Montour band, will pre-
sent a program of traditional and
modern English music at 8 p.m.
Friday in the Stephen Foster
Memorial auditorium.

The performance is sponsored
by the University’s English Na-
tionality Room Committee. The
proceeds will be used to provide
a scholarship for summer study
abroad. ‘

During the past few years,
Nationality Room Committees,
such as the Irish, . Greek, and
French, have sent University
students abroad for summer
study. However, this is the first
time that the English Commit-
tee is attempting to raise schol-
arship funds.

Admission to the student con-
cert will be one dollar for adults
and ﬁfty cents for children under
12. Tickets may be purchased

Try-outs Set For Speech Art Studio

Readings for Pitt Players

Drama Begin Wednesday  

The University Theatre has an-
nounced readings for the Pitt
Players’ production of Jean
Anouilh’s high comedy, “Becket.”

Readings will be held Wednesd-
aay l.p.m.‘1;o 3 p.m., Thursday 6
p.m. to 8 p.m., and Friday 4 p.m.
to 6 p.m., with a ﬁnal call back
on Saturday.

The readings will be held in the
Speech’ Art studio, llth ﬂoor CL,
and are open to all members of the
University community.

Architecture Utilized

The play will be presented in
the Commons Room to make use
of the Gothic architecture‘ there
and will be staged in a “theatre-
in—the-round” atmosphere.

Settings and costumes will be
designed by Philip Eck who did
the scenery a.nd props for last
fall’s production of “Julius
Caesar.” '

It will be directed by Bernard
Engel who has appeared in several
Broadway shows and more recent-
ly directed “The Deadly Game” at
the Pittsburgh Playhouse.

Horses Cast

" The play is a story of conflicting A

friendship and religion between a
reigning French monarch and and
his closest companian in work and
pleasure. One unusual feature is
the requirement of ﬁve horses
upon which people are to be seat-
ed.

According to Bill Kingsley,
technical director of Theatre
11, who was seen as Brutus in
“Caesar”, “We have borrowed a
merry-go-round h o r s e from
which we will construct horses
of a light‘ material. Real horses
are too costly. Since ‘Becket’
takes place in medieval ‘times,
the horses will be unrealistic,
emblematic.”

The more important. characters
in the play are: Henry II, the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Gil-
bert. Folliet, the Bishop of York,
a Saxton, a Peasant, his Son,
Gwendolen, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
English Baron the Queen Mother,
the Queen, Louis, king of France,
and the Pope.

. There are over forty parts avail-
able and rehearsals will not be
more than one or two nights
weekly for most characters.

SOCCER

Members of the soccer team
are asked to attend a meeting in

the conference room of the‘

Field House on Wednesday at
'4:30 p.m. Any other students
interested in trying for a berth
on next year’s team’ should at-
tend also.

THE UNIVERSITY THEATER and the Pitt Players have cast the

mons Room, a wooden performer was recruited from a merry-

go-round.

Letters to the Editor

Student Questions
VSG Referendum

, Editor, The Pitt News:

,Last Monday there was a
broadcast on WPGH concerning
the proposed reorganization of
Student Government. I believe
that the student leaders who

.‘_took part inpthis program erred
in their view on the proposals. -

I feel that the ﬁrst question
that must be decided is whether
there should be a StudentGov-
ernment at all. Proposed plans
for a referendum are entirely in
order. However, I think that
they are using the wrong ap-

_ proach. ~

As will be shown on the ref-
erendum, there will be two pos-
sibilities for a yes vote and one
for a no vote. As it stands now,
the ballot will read: _

1. Yes, we want a Student
Government, but like this.

2. Yes, we want a Student
Government, but like this.

3. No, we don’t want a Stu-V

dent Government. V

V In this situation, we have
these possibilities: If each item
is taken separately, the no’s
could win‘ without a majority
of votes. For example, if the no
votes outnumber those tallied
forq each proposal but do not
constitute a majority of the
total vote and the combined yes
vote outnumbers the no vote,
who wins? Does‘ the no vote win

"because it has more votes than

either of the yes votes or odes
the "yes vote win because- its

combined total is higher. If the
combined total takes precedence,
does the higher yes vote auto-
matically win?

To avoid confusion, my own
idea is to ﬁrst have a referen-
dum with just two choices:

1. Yes, we want a student
“governing” organization.

2. No, we don’t want a student
“governing” organization. This
must come ﬁrst. Then if the stu-
dents vote for the bill, proposals
can be presented as to how it
should be organized. This would
give the no voters an opportu-
nity to choose which proposal
they would rather be “govern-
ed” by.‘

If the vote is no, there is no
problem. But, at least it will be
on an equal basis as to Yes and
No. .

Coed Would Limit

Value of ‘Solitude’

Editor, The Pitt News:

I read with interest Mr. Maw-
hinney’s column, “The Last
Walden,” in the Wednesday issue
of The Pitt News. Certainly soli-
tude is a prerequisite for serious
thought, but I would alsovlike to
remind him of the words of a
French philosopher, Henri Sten-
dahl, “One can acquire every-
thing in solitude except char-
acter.”

Public Relations Reticence . . .

‘Speak No Evil’

By JIM O'BRIEN

A Chinese legend says that Confucius told his
disciples a special message as a «guide for their lives
when he was about to depart from the earth. The
sage drew pictures of three monkeys in the sand
and told his disciples the maxim: 0
“Speak no evil, see no evil, hear
no evil.”

Let’s face it. Only seventy-
two ‘inches of sod shoveled over
your coiﬁn would allow you to
live so. But there are a lot of‘
people who ﬁgure that Pitt's
public ‘relations department is
run according to the fabled
Oriental design.

This supposed organ of com-
munications’ handling of the is- , M
sues concerning the recent University disciplinary
action seems to support this belief.

Despite what administrators say, they were
obligatedito issue a news statement in this matter.

They boast of the juggernaut during the season, i
and 40,000 people shell out hard cash to see him in’

action. Souwhen he’s naughty, -he's news. He’s dead
smack in the pupil of the public eye.

A stereotyped statement would have done the
trick. Butjthe public relations men seemed dumb-
foundedbecause of the complexity’ of the case.

Clenell Fists

“It’s best we didn’t -say anything,” one of them
was overheard saying. “We’re "putting the news-

papersin a precarious position. They’ll be afraid »

to touch the story for fear of libel. They’ll. be
afraid; they’ll watch their steps lest they print the
wrong names.”

Newspapermen aren’t dunces, they ‘printed the
right names and cast a'mysterious shadow on the
campus. The PR men didn’ti budge. They held
their ﬁsts tightly clenched to the info, and the more
the public pried the more dirt they ‘came up with.

“No comment,”, 7was the only answer to all
phone cal-ls seeking an answerito the suspension.

“I think they have insulted us,” a downtown
newspaper editor cried‘. “They apparently have no

A Conservative Speaks...

  Liberal

By Richard J. Bishiriicm
Mr. Nathan Firestone in his article, “Conserva-
tive Crisis,” has so distorted the contentions of con-
temporary conversatism, that I, as a conservative,
feel the need to give rebuttal.

The year 1961 was a disastrous year for the-

United States and its people as

tion in the Congo, the Soviet
atmospheric testing of nuclear
weapons, and Castro’s reign on
the island of Cuba.

The uneasiness of the peo-
ple of the United~States has
resulted in a revival of con‘-
illustrated . by the
appearance of local and na-
tional conservative organiza-
tions on campuses.‘ But, what is most important,
the election of conservatives to positions in gov-
ernment has been realized. _

Mr. Firestone rightly considers this revival of
conservatism to be dangerous, for he and other
liberals will be the ﬁrst to be displaced by the
shift of sentiment to the right. And so, Mr. Fire-
stone contends conservatism is most vulnerable
in the areas of social legisl.ation, civil rights, and
foreign policy.

Firestone’s Premise ‘
Mr. Firestone’s ﬁrst premise; a healthy nation

moves forward in social legislation. Conservatives .

are against social legislation, therefore, the spread
of conservatism will result in an unhealthy nation.
I will assume that Firestone, as a liberal, deﬁnes
“social legislation” as progressive legislation, ex-
empliﬁed by the New Deal, Fair Deal, New Fron-
tier, and other Welfare State measures.

I agree with Frederick Hayek that “some of the
aims of the welfare state can be realized without
detriment to invividual liberty” when it attempts
to provide for limited security. But, when the Wel-

, fare State attempts to “use the powers of govern-

mentto insure a more even or more just distribu-

faith in our integrity, and sense of good judgmenﬁ
I would be the last to blackball the name of Pitt
no matter what happened."

Mix Explosive - ‘

Still the PR boys played around with the situa-
tion like schoolboys in a chemistry lab after Class * * V

hours. They came up with nitroglycerine. »
Just as the sore boil was coming to a head, a-
man who is as sharp as a needle came back to town

to burst the bubble. Chancellor Edward H. Litch-' 0

 

ﬁeld, was away when the story broke, but after '

few/ consultations a perfect statement was released
to the press.

It satisﬁed most. Had it been issued earlier,

conjecture would have been reduced considerably. V’

Meanwhile speculation is hotter than a pressure,
cooker.

New York City is still shell-shocked over. they
upheaval in their college athletic ranks after the E

recent basketball ‘ﬁx” scandals, and the Manhattan
mind ﬁgures thatthe 3-7 record must have been
due to “ﬁxing.” That’s why the boys got the boot,
they thought. M .

Athletic Director Frank Carver found this out
last week when he received a phone call from the
Big Town. “The New York Herald-Tribune
thought it was “ﬁxing,” Carver explained. “They’re
so keyed up about that, that.it’s the ﬁrst thing
that they thought of. I told them it definitely was
not.”

Dr. Alan C. Rankin, assistant chancellor of stu-
dent and general aﬁairs, explained the school’s
failure to tell all. “We are striving for a relation-
ship similar to -the one which exists,” he said, “be-
tween a doctor and his. patient, a lawyer and his

client, or a priest and his parishioner -—- we aren’t-

going to ‘betray the conﬁdence ‘of these students.”

Gossip has been well deﬁned as putting two and

two together, and making ﬁve, and George Eliot
once wrote: “A cruel story runs on wheels, and

. every hand oils the wheels as they run.”

The public relations men must have been ac-
complished wheelwrights before they took up their
latest duties.

C O O
concilable with at free society.” Then the conserva-
tive ﬁnds himself against “social legislation,” not

-,-assuming, as does Mr. Firestone, that all “social

legislation” is good.
Mr. Firestone states that although conserva-

' tives “are the loudest advocates” of constitutional-

ism, we are “opposed to granting constitutional
rights to all of our citizens,” implying that we are
inconsistent. I feel that the Constitution is the
“best arrallgement yet devised. for empowering
government to fulﬁll its proper role while restrain-
ing it from the concentration and abuse of power”

' and this belief commands an obedience which does

not allow conspiracy.

Upheld ALL Rights“

Mr. Firestone has made the error of confusing
State’s Rights with Civil Rights. The conservative
upholds all rights guaranteed by the Constitution;
the rights of the individual, the States, and the
Federal Government. A

Mr. Firestone considers three foreign policy
positions on which the conservative position is sup-
posedly ill advised.

On Cuba, he holds that the conservatives “would '

invade” but are “afraid” to consider the repurcus-
sions. The conservatives preach victory over com-
munism and place the just interest of the United
States above the interest of “world opinion.” But,
to charge that we are “afraid”ior neglect the con-
sequences of our actions is to be childish.

On the Congo issue, Mr.,Firestone argues that
the U. N. ‘action was justiﬁed because “Tshombe
is a puppet of European mining interests, and
could never be independent.” Nonsense! The issue
is not the dependence or independence of Tshombe,
but, whether or not a nation has the right to work
out ‘its own problems without interference by a
supposed higher authority.

The United Nations, Mr. Firestone contends, is
our “only hope for a peaceful victory against com-
munism.” , But the U. N. is not a technique for
attaining “victory”; it is a technique for attaining
“peace.” The conservative asks himself, “Does be-
ing in the U. .,N. serve the . just interests of the
United States?” If being in the U. N. means “peace”

RUNYON’S GUY AND DOLL

Radio Ritchie and Roundball Liz are as Runyonesque as Cock-
Eyed Corrigan, Bookie Bob, Harry the Horse. West Side Willie or
Little Miss Marker. Damon’s species, strictly in the muggola de-
partment, held forth in,the booths of lVIindy’s Restaurant on Broad-
way.‘ Radio and Roundball can be found in Gustine’s Restaurant,
after a basketball game.

Radio and Roundball are not characters from the pen of Dickens,
they are not fictional, even if any resemblance to any characters living
or dead is purely coincidental. It was after a basketball game.

Radio Ritchie was hovering closely over his sunnyside eggs,
guzzling a glass of chocolate milk, which he says is his favorite bever-
age. Radio’s a busted guy. he is generally broke. He hasn’t worked
for a while. a ‘ L
Runner for Town. Crier * ‘

He’s a dishwasher by trade, worked in a downtown hotel, which
doled out about $12 a week to him for scraping egg stains off of rich
china. He picks up a few bobs here and there and is a runner for
Town Crier, whose square monicker is Joe Tucker. A

Town Crier broadcasts the Pittsburgh Steeler football games. and
has a nightly sports show via ‘the radio. Ritchie hustles for Town
Crier. keeping statistics, and running score sheets.

This is Ritchie’s favorite work for it gets him close to his
escape world of sports. He loves basketball. His name was tagged
on him because of his habit of holding a transistor radioj‘ next to

- his elf-like ears during most of his waking hours. He listens for
basketball scores and scribbles them on an intricate score sheet.

Radio is a Rens fan. “I set my clock to get up at three o’clock
in the morning,” Radio boasted one eve, “when the Rens are in
Hawaii so that I can get the score for their night games. Den I go
back to bed, and don’t get up till eight.” .

Why he gets up at eight, naturally, is beyond human compre-
hension. Personally I think it’s to annoy Dukes Sharbaugh, the tub-
thumper for Duquesne’s. Bluff school. He visits Dukes every day like
clockwork to discuss basketball.

No Crockery ,

Radio’s a skinny guy, with an honest pan, a wide-mouth with an
absence of crockery,vand the top of his noggin is as close-shaved as
El Beano, Pitt's tub-thumper whose coiffure was once compared to
a bocci green. , , 1

Radio’s not married. If he were, a perfect ‘mate, basketball-wise,
would be Rolindball Liz, a doll who was sitting across the table from
him, stirring 3 mixed drink.

Roundball Liz has claustrophobia and demands tickets in the
front row to watch, basketball games. A friend of hers doesn’t
buy the claustrophobia bit, claiming she just wants to be seen.
"But she: once opened» the back door of an auto traveling on the
Parkway because“ she was in the backseat. ,

Roundball Liz was in agony. “That Mike Rice makes me so mad,”
she bellowed. “I just can’t stand that awful language of his.’i Rice
is a Duquesne guard, who Is nearly as deﬁcient crockery-wise as
Radio Ritchie. ' 1

Liz can read Rice’s lips, and is repelled by his utterings.

They’re not as muﬂled as the sounds of Ritchie’s radio.

°Squad Sharp

In 30-2 Win

, By BOB SMIZIK

Coach Rex Peery’s king-
size gamble paid off in equal-
ly large dividends Saturday
as his grapplers showed

championship form in scor-

ing a near shut out over Syr-
acuse, 30-2, at the Field House.

Peery broke a long standing
rule in the coaching profession, of
never breaking up a winner, by
shifting John Zolikoff, one of the
East’s ﬁnest 147 pounders, down to
137 pounds and moving the for-
mer inhabitant of that spot, Daryl
Kelvington, into Zolikoif’s old
position.

Both grapplers came through
with flying colors. Zolikoff had a
tough time in edging Fred Hoff-
man, 3-2, but in Peery’s words,
“John looked read good out
there.” Kelvington waged a score-
less dual with Dick Slutsky for
two periods "before coming on
to win, 6-1. .

Could Be Changed

The coach appeared well pleas-
ed with the new lineup, but was
not sure he would use it against

Army next week. “A lot will de- -

pend on how they (Army) line
up,” he remarked in regards to
the Zolikoff-Kelvington switch.

In the Syracuse locker room
the Orange Coach, Joe Candra,
complained about the officiating
but admitted “it wouldn’t have
changed the results.”

Scandra called Pitt “a pmuch
better balanced team than last
year,”
them with Lehigh. However, he
did say that “Pitt appeared to

have a definite edge at 191 and"

heavyweight,” two classes that
had been considered toss-ups.

It was no wonder that Scandra
was impressed with the Cat’s
heavyweights, as both of them,
Tom Jeffries and Jeff Ware scor-
ed pins. Other Panther winners
were Rich Martin, Sherm Moyer,
Jim Harrison and Ken Barr.

Lehigh Loses

C Swim, 73-20

By LEN BERENFIELD

Before his swimmers met Pitt.

last Saturday, Lehigh coach Bill
Christian "called his team
young. one, which will improve as
the season progresses.” " Evidently,
Lehigh was still too inexperienced
for Pitt, as the snarling Panthers
handed the Engineers their fourth
defeat of the year. in a most con-
vincing manner, 73-20.

Once again it was the Levine
twins, Rob and Ron, who sparked
the Blue and Gold, each scoring
double victories. Rob won the 100
and 220 yards free style events,
while Ron took the 200 yards
medley and the 200 yards butter-
fly.

Lehigh was completely over-
powered by the Panthers, as
they were able to capture only
one ﬁrst place during the after-
noon, in the 440 yards free style.
Team captain John DiBardillo
copped that event for the Engi-
neers.

After Rob Levine set a new

pool record at West Virginia, Pitt
coach Ben Grady commented,
“The team ‘has. a lot of potential
and should break some more re-
cords before the year is over."
Making the coach look like a
prophet, Ron Levine set a new
Pitt record in the medley, 2217.5,
more than 2 seconds faster than
the old record. .
Pitt now owns a 2-0 record
which they will risk against
Maryland next Saturday

ercoming Titans

By ART FLEISCHNER
After watching Duquesne
slaughter C a r n e g i. e Tech,
many of the 3,800 fans at the
Field House Saturday night

-sat back to watch highly re-_

garded Westminster do the
same thing to a better than ave-
rage Pitt team. The final score of
58-45 in favor of. the Panthers
proved to be an unpleasant shock.

In their biggest win of the sea-
son, the Blue and Gold let their
ﬁne defensive play do most of the
tolking. The Titans, who were
averaging 80 points a game, just
managed to make half of that.

Little All-American Ron Gal-
breath was stymied in an attempt
to maintain his 20 point per game
average ond ended up with only
seven for the night.

A smiling Bob Timmons ac-

cepted congratulations while sin-t"~-=

gling out, “a great team effort,
-hustle on the boards, and especial-

? ly defense,”. as major contributors

to victory. Ben Jinks and Tom Ma-
lon_ey held Galbreath to his mea-
ger total. Jinks only permitted
the scoring whiz three points in
the ﬁrst half.

Halftime totals showed the
Cats leading 27-20. An impor-
tant factor in this was the nine
of eleven fouls the team made.
They ended the game making 18
of 23 for 73 percent. Their work
in this department has put them
among the top ten teams in the
country in this respect.

Paul Kriegér. Dave Sauer, and

as the whole Titan team. _

Bob Sankey turned in his sec.
ondiine game in a row and chip-
ped in with eight points. Looking
at. the totals of the players it is
fairly evident that it was, “a team

Old coaches never die, they just
fade away _— unless they’re en.
dowed with the longevity of Dr.
H, C. “Red” Carlson, one-time
baskmball coach at Pitt for some
31 seasons.

His hair just fades away. and
the redness is quite pale nowa-
days. except for a slight tingle on
the John L. Lewis styled eye-
brows. The Dapper Dan Club has
chosen. to increase the legend of
the venerable one by honoring
him at their forthcoming awards,
dinner on February 4.

"There are two extremes in this

“world,” Doc says. “They’re hon-

oring the great, and the other ex_—
treme. I represent the east end of
the horse traveling westward.”
Carlson’s hair is white, but his
verse is still as colorful as ever:

gone forever.”
