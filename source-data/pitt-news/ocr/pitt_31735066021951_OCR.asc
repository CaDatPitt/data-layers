By Teresa Candori
News Editor

The Student Government
Board last night adopted a reso-
lution proposing an increase in
the undergraduate. student activi-
ties fee. The resolution was

passed unanimously among the .

members present.

According to the proposal,
”The activities fee for all under-
graduate full-time non—CGS stu-
dents shall be increased to $32
per term.” The activities fee for
full-time students is presently $24
per term.

The proposal continued, ”The
activities fee for all undergradu-
ate part-time non—CGS students
shall be increased to $10 per
term.” The present activities fee
for part-time students is $8 per
term.

Under the proposed plan, the
breakdown of the fee will remain

_ the same, with 50 percent going .

to the Student Government Board
Allocations Committee, 15 per-

cent going to the Student Publi-'

cations and Media.Board, and 35
percent going to the Pitt_Program

The bulk of Greek Week's

Week officials. I

Canning, whichinvolves mem-
bers of fraternities and sororities

Though the legal canning day -
is March 12, cans were distribu‘t=‘

ed and the Greeks began collect-

February. V _

”Sometimes the police will be
lenient since it's for charity,” said
Lee Brody, co-supervisor of
Greek Week events. ”Sometimes
we~will go to an intersection, and
the police will throw us out. We

Pitt's Alpha Phi Alpha fraterni-
ty has had its charter suspended
for alleged hazing, but no mem-
bers of the fraternity itself are sus-
pected of striking pledges.

Two Alpha Phi Alpha pledges
were allegedly hit by students
from another school as members
of the Pitt charter looked the
other way.

resources for getting "us more per-
mits for canning. We want to do
everything we can to raise money
for charity, _so we're willing to
take the risk,” said Brody. ’

For the week of March 9, two

membersfrom -each'fraternity and‘ --  --
sorority will be permitted to can"

at the Greater Pittsburgh interna-
tional Airport.
According to Kumer,
fraternity and sorority has a differ-
ent way of canning. ”We send
them up at [7 a.m. to] can the in-
tersection where people are go-
ing to work and [to] can the major
intersections, between 3 and 5
p.m., when people are coming
from work. I
”The true key is [when] you're
at an intersection, and the first
person in line gives — everybody
in line gives. If the.first two peo-

. ple shake their heads and say no,

you’re'not going to get anything

. from anybody,” said Kumer.

Fraternities and sororities use
various methods to encourage
their members for a strong com-
mitment in canning, according to

”l‘ have no complaints towards‘
Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity at
Pitt,” said Mark-Wilson, one of

. the pledges involved.

Allegedly, the students who
struck Wilson and the other
pledge (who remains unidenti-
fied), were members of Alpha Phi
Alpha at Indiana University of
Pennsylvania. '

Wilson, reaffirming the fact that
he has no complaints with any
members of the Pitt charter,’ re-

Phil Moyer, the resolution will be
forwarded to Dr. Connie Kimbo,
vice president for student affairs
at Pitt, and then to Dr. Jack Free-
man, external vice president of
the university. If approved, the
resolution will pass to the board
of trustees, who will make the fi-
nal decision.

Moyer reported that the student

activities fee has not been raised
since 1980, when itwas changed _

from $12 to $24.

cal year falls 52 percent short of
meeting budget requests. The Al-
locations Committee is presently
in the process of reviewing budg-
et requests submitted by student
organizations for fiscal year 1988.
The student activities fee was a
major issue of Moyer’s platform
in last Novemb_er’s campaign.
”The amount we're working

with is minimal" compared to the _

amount we need,” Moyer said in
November. ’’I know that a lot of
organizations are upset about not
getting money. We didn't have
any money to give them.”

to the administration "read, 

”...The Student Govern'me'nt
Board has determined that an in-

crease in the student activities fee 4

”Each pledge class competes
against each other to see who can
raise the most money,” said
Kumer, who is alsoa Phi Gam-

a prize for the best group. We
also have aboard up, and it
shows how much each brother

fused to talk about any other ap-

On Tuesday, '-however, Dr.
Harry Budd, regional director for

‘Alpha Phi Alpha, said the whole

incident was uncovered when
the pledges protested what had
occurred. ' -

Prospect for superpower treaty revitalized

BRUSSELS, Belgium — The
chief U.S. arms negotiator gave
the NATO allies an up-beat as-
sessment Thursday of prospects
for a superpower agreement to
scrap medium-range nuclear mis-
siles in Europe, sources said.

Max M. Kampelman and the
two other delegates to the U.S.-
Soviet arms talks in Geneva,
Maynard W. Gliman and Ron
Lehman, briefed the 16 NATO
ambassadors at a c|osed—door,
two-hour meeting before flying to
consultations in Washington.

The Geneva negotiations got
new life last weekend when
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gor-
bachev announced willingness to
sign a treaty on medium-range
missiles separately from a pack-
age covering long-range missiles
and ”Star Wars,” the U.S. plan
for_a space-based defense system.

The United States agreed in
principle and submitted a pro-
posed treaty to Soviet negotiators
on Wednesday that would
eliminate U.S. cruise, Pershing 2
and Soviet SS—20 nuclear forces
from Europe.

Democrats attempt to
highlight money void

WASHINGTON — House
Democrats said Thursday that
they plan a vote next week on
legislation that would shut off fur-
ther aid to Nicaragua’s Contra re-
bels until previous aid is
accounted for, including any
money diverted from Iranian
arms sales or solicited from pri-

' vate SOUTCES.

”We as a party need to make
a statement on this issue,” said
Rep. David Bonior (D-Mich.)
However, he said aid opponents
probably do not have the votes to
override an almost certain
presidential veto.

The Democrats’ move was
seen primarily as an effort to fo-
cus attention on the administra-
tion's inability to account for tens
of millions of dollars in previous
aid money, an issue already
raised by last week's Tower com-

mission report on the Iran-Contra ‘

affair as well as by congressional
investigators.

President Reagan said Thurs-

Gilhool unanimously

endorsed by Senate

HARRISBURG — A state
Senate committee on Tuesday
praised Gov. Robert P. Casey's
choice for education secretary
and recommended that the entire
Senate confirm his nomination.

The Education Committee
unanimously endorsed "Thomas
K. Gilhool, a Philadelphia lawyer
with a self—described non-
traditional background, for the
job. The vote came after nearly
two hours of questioning and
praise by’ senators from both po-
litical parties.

Gilhool, a. noted advocate of

  

educational rights_for the han-
dicapped, has often battled with
educationpolicy makers. In a
1971 lawsuit against the state, for
instance, he won educational
guarantees for the handicapped.

Soviets admit to error
and will publish novel

MOSCOW — Poet Yevgeny
Yevtushenko said the ban on
Boris Pasternak’s epic novel Doc-
tor Zhivago more than 30 years
ago resulted from intrigue in a
misguided Kremlin and from
what he called provocations in
the Western press.

The novel will be published in
the Soviet Union for the first time
next year.

”We are now righting a tragic

error with regard to a most honest
writer, a man who never in his
life would have thought that he
could become the object of po-
litical speculation,” Yevtushenko
said in an interview with The A5-
sociated Press.

 President's wife
should stay home

According to a story published in The New York Times on

A _‘ Wednesday, Nancy Reagan's power base has never been
stronger than the day Donald Regan left the post of chief of

staff. For some months, the two had been fighting in public,
and Mrs. Reagan had made no secret of her,desire to see him
ousted. -

He was ousted, and Mrs. Reagan is said to be looking to the
future with the hope that she can save her husband from fur-
ther political embarrassment. i ‘

This is political rape, nothing more.

Nancy Reagan is not the president of the country. That may
seem, to most, a statement not.necessary._Mrs. Reagan is obvi-
ously a little foggy on the point, and this is for her benefit.

It would appear that she has assumed it to be her responsi-
bility and her duty to make or directly influence policy deci-
sions. If she is a lobbyist, let her function in those channels,
not from the White House with a full, government-paid staff.

It is inherently wrong to have someone in a democracy wield-

_ ’ ing such power who was never approved for office by any elect-

ed body. She is functioning with an autonomy not befitting any

representative government. g
If her influence is to be tolerated in the public forum, how '

large is the step to the other spouses of government officials

and then even their friends? It is not a case that can be ignored,
- especially when she is so willing to flaunt her abuse of her hus-
. band's power before the media with such defiance.

It is not her responsibility to make government decisions. It
is not her place. It is not her right.

If Mrs. Reagan has any bent fo'r legitimate political power,
let her run for office as any other official. She is a citizen of

the country and, though she doesn't seem to realize it, subject '

to the same laws as the rest of us. She would do well to heed

. the warning. Neither of the Reagans can afford to further offend

the people's trust.

Gagging on SGB’s new rule

Student Government Board
President Phil Moyer has decid-
ed to enforce a nifty little thing he
calls the "gag ru|e."

Under the gag rule, members
of the Allocations Committee are
not to speak to the press regard-

ing committee business. Karen -

Bohichik, chairperson of the Al-
locations Committee, will speak
for the committee, but Moyer
must be present at all interviews.

"Since I am the chief
spokesperson for the student
government, I am responsible for
the information presented to the
press,” Moyer said.

The new rule came about part-.

ly i-nreaction to a recent state-

ment by Bohichik regarding the —

establishment of an allocations
task force to monitor events fund-
ed by allocations.

Bohichik was quoted in the
Feb. 25 issue of The Pitt News as
saying, "... We've decided that,
as a task force, we're going to
start sendingmembers of the Al-
locations Committee to look into
where the money's going.”

According to Moyer, Bohichik
”overstepped her bounds” when
she made the statement.

T TERESA

cnunonl

"Any task force that comes
from this office will be initiated
by the board, it will be monitored
by the board, and it will be un-
der the board's supervision,”
Moyer said. He added that the
board has not taken any definitive
steps to organize such a task
force.

Moyer said that members of the
Allocations Committee are not
student representatives since they
are appointed and not elected.

the SGB, who are the elected
representatives of the student
body. The board members are, in
turn, accountable to the student
body.

Politics is never simple.

”The opinions. of the individu-
al liaisons may not be the opin-
ions of this office,” Moyer said.
”Our [the SGB] duty is to sort out
opinion from fact and to find out

what's going on." In this manner,

Moyer himself can present the

real story to the press.

In a letter to the staff of The Pitt
News soon after his election,
Moyer said, '’I’m hoping for a
more apparent relation between
The Pitt News and the Student
Government in the coming year
in order to create smoother [con-
senses] between the students,
yourselves, the Board and [me].”

"Smooth” being the operative
word here.

Although Moyer has repeated-
ly expressed his confidence in the

Warhol's ethnicity
I feel prompted to write regard-
ing the misidentification of Andy
Warhol's ethnicity. UPI called the
Slavic department yesterday for
clarification since they saw
Warhol's ethnicity listed as
Czech, Slovak, Ukranian and

Carpatho-Rusyn. After contacting A

family members, UPI. was in-
formed that Warhol was of
Carpatho-Rusyn extraction.

The _Carpatho-Rusyns are an
ethnic groupwhich can befound

in parts of southern Poland,
eastern Czechoslovakia, and
western Ukraine. They are
Carpatho—Rusyns (also called Rus-
naks and Ruthenian) and not
Czechs, not Slovaks and not
Ukranians. (Although many
Ukranians argue this point.) Your
article‘ on Feb. 23 claimed
Warhol was Czech. This is a very
common mistake that is made
concerning emigrants from
Czechoslovakia. It is one that
causes much anger on the part of
Slovaks and Rusyns who, due to
ignorance on the part of the non-
East Europeans (and even some
East Europeans, I'm afraid), are
”lumped" under the ”Czech”
label. That's too easy. Each eth-
nic group in Czechoslovakia
deserves to be recognized as in-
dividual — the Czechs, the Slo-
vaks, the Carpatho—Rusyns etc. As

far as learning more about who"

the Carpatho—Rusyns are, visit the
Pittsburgh Folk Festival this year.
The Rusyns will tell you who they
are —_ and who they are not!

The March 9 edition of
U.S.News and World Report con-
tains an article that covers the
most recent debate in higher edu-
cation — that debate being,
”Why does college cost so
much?”

On one side of the argument,
we have Secretary of Education
William Bennett and, presuma-
bly, the rest of the Reagan Ad-
ministration, who claim that
greed and inefficiency are to
blame for the soaring costs of a
college education. On the oppos-
ing side there is a team made up
of college and university officials
who claim that Bennett is arguing
with false statistics and that tui-
tions are increasing because of
cuts in federal spending on
higher education.

In October 1986,, Bennett
spoke at an event marking the
350th birthday of Harvard, and in
his address he said, ”Higher edu-
cation refuses to acknowledge
the obvious fact that, in general,
it is rich.”

Later, Stanford University Presi-
dent Donald Kennedy countered
Bennett by saying, ”We are run-
ning harder and not staying even.
Knowledge gets more ex-
pensive.” »

Since 1980, the cost of energy
has increased 0.4 percent annu-
ally, new cars 3.8 percent, food
3.9 percent, medical care 4.8 per-
cent and college tuitions 10.6
percent. Next year, the average
tuition bill is expected to increase
by 6 percent over this year. -That’s
nearly three times the current in-
flation’ rate. The U.5. News arti-
cle also listed the percentages of
increase in some representative
colleges’ tuitions since the aca-
demic year of 1970-71 to
1986-87. '

THE   PitrNEws, Flriday, March 6,-1987__ 

 

 

PAUL ANOATER

In 1970, Harvard's tuition cost
$2,600 a year. In 1987, Harvard
costs’ $11,390 —- that’s an in-
crease of'338 percent in just 17
years. The University of Texas at
Austin has increased its tuition
380 percent for in—state students
and 800 percent for out—of—state
students in those same 17 years.
Harvard and Austin were pretty
much representative of the other

six schools mentioned in the ar- -
ticle. College tuitions continue to

rise at rates far higher than cur-
rent inflation rate, why?

Bennett and the rest of
Washington seem to blame the
institutions. It's their ”greed and
inability to budget” that has
caused the staggering increases in
the price tag attatched to a
bachelor's degree. That almost
makes sense. Holding a
bachelor's degree is absolutely vi-
tal to entering the job market.

This need increases every year, as

does the cost of a degree. It's sim-
ple supply and demand.

— Kennedy and the rest of acade-
mia maintain that during the
1970s, when federal aid to col-
leges and universities was gener-
ous, tuition costs increased less
than most other goods and serv-
ices. It’s only been since 1980,

 

Tuition costs are too high  

and the dawn\of the Reagan era,
that tuitions have risen so great-
ly. As Washington‘ decreases its
assistance, the institutionshave to
increase their tuitions. That
almost makes sense. It’s simple

* arithmetic.

So who's to blame? It's always
easiest to blame big, bad govern-
ment when there’s a situation like
this. Especially in 1987 when
Reagan—bashing has become a
new national pastime._However,
how innocent are the colleges
through all of this? You decide.

Is the qual'ity of your education
increasing atthe same rate as
your tuition? In Pitt's case, the
quality of the formals has gone up

markedly, but has the worth of I

my bachelor’s degree? ~

Kennedy gave a press confer-

ence in New York not too long

ago. Stanford is in the process of
trying to raise $1.1 billion in their

latest fund—raising campaign. "

When the subject of increasing
tuitions costs, even in_the face of
such a grandiose campaign, he
said, ”We don't have any con-
trol over any income item other

than tuition.” So colleges don't-

know if their giving campaigns
will work, but they know that a
tuition increase will.

Washington isn't innocent
either. Education cuts are suici-
dal. Hopefully, there will only be

two more years of these self-A

destructive tendencies.

In the meantime, university ad-
ministrators and students have to
decide how justified are tuition
increases that triple current infla-

-tion rates?

It's an inane situation that's not
going to go away, but something

has to be done. Let's go on strike.‘

What do you think?

Hartless election appraisal  

In less than 21 months, Ameri-
cans will go to the polls to select
a new president. But who will
they choose, and what is he like-
ly to stand for?

Until about half a year ago, it
seemed almost completely cer-
tain that a conservative Republi-
can, most likely Bush, would
succeed Reagan. Given the presi-
dent's popularilty and the relative
success of his economic plan,
Bush could probably have been

comfortably elected by promising V

a continuation of Reagan's
policies. .

But, alas, such scenarios are
now mere fairy tales for conser-
vatives. In four short months, the
house has come down. Eight
seats and control of the Senate
were lost to the Democrats
despite the intense compaigning
of the president. The Iran-Contra
scandal erupted, cutting Reagan's
popularity in half. And two weeks
ago, the former National Securi-
ty Adviser tried to kill himself.
One has to believe Bush now
regards with painful ambivalence
the President's calling him ”the
best vice president this nation
ever had.”_

But despite all this, Bush, or
another conservative,_ may yet
wind up in the White House.

Why? .

 

I I JACK
BURKMAN
There's an old saying in poli-

tics, ”Americans vote their pock-
etbooks.” All the rhetoric about

' the deficit and the trade im-

balance means little to the_ aver-
age citizen. What matters to most
everyone is that inflation is down,

and the GNP and the Dow Jones I

industrial average are up. The
1988 Republican nominee may
want to distance himself some-
whatfrom the presidentﬂbut not
the president's economic
philosophy. -

What's more, at the national
level, the Democratic Party is in
a state of ideological and or-
ganizational disarray. Finding a
platform for '88 may prove to be
almost as difficult as in '84. What

the Democrats might do, and in- —

deed probably will, especially if
Bush is the GOP nominee, is call
for an end to secrecy and a return
to ”honesty” in government and
take measures to reduce the fed-
eral deficit.

But such resolutions might
backfire. For one, while the pub-
lic will hold .the administration
responsible for the current
deficits, it is not likely to forget
that the ‘Democrats had budget '

ml, .

problems of their own not so long
ago. ’

Secondly, capitalizing on the

" Iran-Contra affair might not be as

easy as it seems. With Governor
Mario Cuomo out of the race,
Gary Hart is the only mai_nstream
Democrat with any subtantial na-
tional exposure. If Bush does in-
deed become the Republican
standard-bearer, Hart should
think twice before making an all-
out effort to associate the vice
president with the scandal. A
campaign of labeling and name-
calling could invite scrutinizing
of the senator's past, most nota-

bly hisaffiliation with the‘

McGovern candidacy of 1972.
Bush might, for example, in refer-
ring to his opponent, say some-
thing in passing like, ”What I
believe Senator Hartpence — I
mean Senator Hartmeans ...”

But no matter whom the GOP
nominates, the Democrats still
must face the fact that they have
no real national identity. The
party remains seriously divided.
Certain ideologies, it seems, such
as the New Deal, have yet to be
completely buried.

In short, then, despite the po- .

litical upheaval of the last few
months, the Republicans, provid-
ed they don't self-destruct inthe
primaries, should be able to hold

onto the White House in 1988.‘ ’

Shultz’s tiger-clad
tush is lots of fun 

Most of the news coming
out of official Washington
last week was pretty dismal.
And as luck would have it,

ing story about the Reagan
administration occured on
the same day that the Tow-
er report was issued — so 
it got very little coverage. ,1

In case you missed it, 1'
Secretary of State George P. A ~ -'

Shultz has a tiger tattooed  

on his rear end.
 p

Confirmation of the fact _ , j
that Shultz’s posterior is decorated with a tiger tattoo came from
his wife, Helena. Mrs. Shultz informed reporters ofthetattoo’
while aboard the secretary's plane, which was on its way to
China.

A month ago, there had been a report that Shultz’s behind
bore the tiger tattoo, but there had been no way to confirm it.

  

 

However, aboard the China—bound plane, Mrs. Shultz told *
reporters that ”he got it at Princeton." Shultz attended college
at Priceton University —' its mascot is the tiger.

Mrs" Shultz added: ”When the children were young, they used
to run up and touch it, and he would growl, and they would
run away.” ‘

Prior to Mrs. Shultz’s revelation, Shultz himself had declined
to discuss the reports of the tattoo. » '

Johanna McGeary, a correspondent for Time magazine who
was aboard the plane, got up the nerve to ask Shultz about the
tattoo. r '

”My gosh," Shultz said to her, ’’I have been investigated by
the FBI, the IRS, by the Senate Intelligence Committee. My mail
is opened. I don't have any secrets left. That's the only thing
Ihave left, what is on my rear end.”

I hope that Shultz, is nottruly embarrassed about his wife's

piece of information to come out of Washington in years.

We all envision the most powerful men in Washington wear-
ing their blue, pin-striped suits, riding in the backs of limou-
sines, being guarded by security personnel. ,

The whole aura is kind of intimidating. The powerbrokers 1
seem so intense and so serious that they have nothing in com-
mon with those of us in the outside world. 7

Shultz, especially, has always seemed like a no-nonsense fel-
low. He has appeared to be a man who is competent at his job
and knowledgable in his field, but certainlylno one to be tri-
fled with. "

I don't know about you, but I already feel closer to him. How
can you help but like a man whose children would run up to » ’
him, touch the tiger on his rear end, and who would then make
a growling sound, sending the children scattering?

Shultz has immediately become my favorite politician.-Be-  1 '

fore I heard the news about the tiger on his butt,‘ -I seldom_
thought about him; now he represents the living personifica- A
tion of the fact that people are, indeed, people. -~
Oh, I'm sure this is going to have repercussions. Now, for _
example, every time that I see Shultz on the TV news or on. N
the front page of the newspaper, the first thing I'm going to think
about is the tiger he is wearing underneath his trousers. That,
no doubt, is why Shultz was reluctant to tell the world about ‘

presence when he knows that everyone is aware of the tiger,
But that's OK — I don't think any less of him as a politician

or a statesman. As a matter of fact, this may change the way 

many of us view our national leaders.

When a senator steps to a lectern to deliver a statement, we
may all be secretly wondering whether he has a tattoo of a fish
emblazoned on his rear. ’ V .

When a congressman is stopped in the Capitol to respond ’
to a newsman’s question, we may be weighing the chances that *
he has a cow tattooed under his pants. . 3

Even when the president of the United States addresses the
nation, we may find ourselvesthinking about — just thinking
about — the possibility that there is something facinating em-
blazoned on thepart of him that is facing away from the camera. '

Thanks, Secretary Shultz. You may-‘not realize it, but you've
restored our faith in Washington.

Mel Gibson is jittery. The man'who"immortalized
Mad Max stands about 5-9 and forces you to recall
the big screen's ability to glorify its heroes. As he sits,
fielding questions, he shifts nervously and lights a
cigarette. T r » ~

”Having a hybrid nature," asserts the American-
born, Austrailian—raised ‘Gibson, "makes you'more
objective. They say that when you approach’ a
character, approach him non—iudgmentally — you be-
came an observer.” , V

Speaking about his new film, [etha/ Weapons, Gib-
son‘in tonates with a subtle pride when regarding his
role as Martin Riggs, a Vietnam vet" who is now an
LAPD "killing machine," or rather, a registered ‘lethal
weapon. V ’

"Riggs is definitely unbalanced," said Gibson. ”But
he has the potential to be normal. He has a lot of
dimensions to him; I liked him, he's a fun guy."

Don’t get the wrong idea. Gibson's small build does
not detract from his muscular frame orthat perfectly
chiseled and eminently attractive face.

His quick wit and sense of humor are utterly appeal-

his profession and a child-like vulnerability to his per-
sonable nature. ' T _ ,

This week, I'd like to take a look at some problems regarding‘lo—
cal music. First, let's look at some questions raised by a letter I
received: . '

    

Lola Fee,

I am writing in response to your recent remarkconcerning music
apathy. While I don't completely understandwhy I should have
to defend my home town to someone who is relatively an outsider,
l’m about to do just that. I have always supported anyone with
a sincere passion for music, and I agree, ‘Pittsburgh has had its fair
share of devoted bands. T . I

Lately, however, local music has iust become a ioke.

It's dwindled down to a bunch of old togies, rich art—brats and
scene makers. Weekends are a drag anymore. The [Electric]
Banana is ridiculously overpriced. Graffiti is a humorless, styleless
ioke. The Decade is mlonopolized by a small, elite group of local
bands, like most clubs. Yes, there are a lot of clubs within walking
distance, but most of them aren't even worth the walk anymore;

Under 2I (all-ages) shows are rare, yet the vast majority of Pitt
students are under 2I . This will be big news to most of the local
bars. When they are available, the clubs up the prices to make
up torthe money they lose on alcohol. Who can afford seven or

' eight bucks a week to see someone they've never even heard of,
or worse yet, someone they've seen 25 times before.
* Look to theclubs and the bands who've been monopolizing the
stages for more than a year now + there'_s your apathy. ,

I don't mean to sound like a scrooge. I love music,‘ especially l_ive
and loud music, but I'm not going to sit back and lap up everything
the locals dish out because I don't have a choice. I do. '

nove/ty. » ‘ '

, A/lost /oca/ bands do perform at c/ubs where alcohol is I I

served. /n order to preserve their /iquor licenses, these c/ubs re— T V I

quire their audiences to be 27 ‘and over. Of a// the venues / '
contacted, only one, Brendan's in Shadyside, had a /ogica/
response. Anyone can enjoy the music, but you must be 27 to‘
enjoy the a/coho/. ' A
Many c/ubs said this wou/d be a difficult rule to enforce.
Severa/ clubs in New York City have found an answer in .
tagging. /f you are 27 or over and you wou/d like to drink,
you sirnp/y show your ID at the door and receive a brace/let
tag, not unlike those for one—price day at Kennywood. This
wou/d be a nice solution in Pittsburgh. ,
Unti/ then, many are/forced to seek out the rare ''a//-ages '

show." Graffiti has a few a//-ages shows. They are usually na— I‘

tiona/ rather than /oca/ acts. The E/ectric Banana has a//-ages -'  

shows on Sundays. They are often (but not always) hardcore, I
, but that's on/y because HC fans have proven themselves a"

/oya/ /ot. Sure the cover for an a//-ages show is going to be
more than other shows. It's not just because the c/ub owners
want to maintain their bank accounts, they wou/d a/so /ike. to
pay the band. A /oca/ band's sa/ary fluctuates with the amount

of people they are able to draw. There‘ are no" contracts in the ' '

Gibson finds no similarities be-

that they "both have a certain
mission and dedication.”

It is to Gibson's (donning long
hair and an American accent)
credit that he has expanded his
repetoire from the Mad Max
genre into not only dramatic
films such as Ga///po//' and Mrs.

such as the Riggs character he

THE PITT NEWS

Ready,set."

Pitt prepares for first
game with Seton Hall

By John Enright
Sports Editor

P.J. Carlesimo has a problem —
and a big one at that. The fifth-
year Seton Hall coach doesn't
know what to make of his talent-
ed yet erratic basketball team.

”l don't know whether or not
1 can analyze the team,” said
Carlesimo. ’’I think I need to be
analyzed for watching my team
play.”

One look at Seton Hall’s incon-
sistency this season will attest to
that. The Pirates finished seventh

’ in the Big East with a record of
-4-12 and 15-12 overall, but two

of those wins were against the
team that seems to be the consen-
sus tournament favorite — Geor-
getown. _

The Pirates knocked off the
Hoyas in Landover, Md., on Jan.
3 by a score of 74-53 and came
back two weeks later to defeat
them again, 66-65. »

“We just happened to play ex-
tremely well those two games. It
was the. two best 40-minute
games we've played this year,”
said Carlesimo. ’’I think we could
have beaten any team in _the
league, including Pittsburgh,
those two games.”

But there is a darker, side to this
Seton Hall team — the one the
Pitt Panthers (12-4, 23-6) hope to
see today at Madison Square
Garden in the 1 p.m. game.

Seton Hall has lost to last place
Connecticut twice, and they were
also victimized by the league's
other doormat — Boston College.

Those three losses are evidence
of how terrible Seton Hall plays
at times, but today — and in the

, entire tournament — anything is

possible.

”The less tale_nted teams will
be playing at a much higher.lev-
el. All the teams will be pumped
.up,” said Pitt point guard Mike

_ And away we go.

‘For the first time ever going
into the Big East tournament, the
Pittsburgh Panthers are one of the
favorite teams towin.

Wait at minute. Does that
sound right? Pittsburgh?
Favorites? Basketball?

If I would have written this a
few years ago, my next line
would have been, "Yeah, and if
you believe that one, I've got this
lovely bridge in Brooklyn 

But not anymore. Now I will

tell anyone who stares in disbelief
to go to just one game and watch
the players. Not the band, not the
cheerleaders, not the other fans
—— but observe the players and
really watch the game itself.
What will be seen is basketball in
its truest sense. _

As a sportswriter and/or, in

  

  
   

Goodson. ' .

Pitt coach Paul Evans also has
his fears. ”Seton Hall is very
talented. They’re a lot like Pitt
was last year,” he said. 2
— lndeed, the Panthers got a taste
of what Seton Hall can do when
the Pirates came strolling into
Fitzgerald Field House last season
and whipped the Panthers 85-73
in a game that was decided, for
the most part, 10 minutes before
halftime.

That's not too surprising be-
cause Carlesimo has talented
players such as center Mark
Bryant, forward Martin Salley and
guards James Major and John
Morton. ‘And Carlesimo’s con-
cerns lie with those players, not
the Panthers. ’’I’m more con-
cerned with how we play than
how Pittsburgh does. I think ifwe
play our game, wecan play with
Pitt,” he said. .

Pitt is 0-4 in’ Big East tour_na-
ment games, while the Pirates are
2-7. Both teams will be looking
to make it into the semifinals for
the first time ever.

What may be a problem for Se-
ton Hall, though, is Pitt center
Charles Smith.» The 6-10 junior
center had two of his poorer scor-
ing performances this year (11
and four points) against the
Pirates.

Yet, the Panthers were still able
to defeat Seton Hall twice —
87-85 on Jan. 14in New Jersey
and 95-81 on Jan. 28 in
Pittsburgh.

Evans thinks the odds are
against Smith having another
poor performance today. ’’I think
Charles will have a good game,”
said Evans. The Pirates may try to
foul Smith to frustrate him and
take him out of his element — a
strategy that St. John's worked to
perfection twice this season.

Evans, though, doesn't know if

fans do. Instead of throwing

streamers after the first shot is
made or jumping up at every one
"of Charles Smith's dunks, l have
to scribble down into anotebook
exactly what goes on, _and this

ranges from'keeping all the points -

tallied to expressions on players’
faces. l’m not complaining —— af-
ter all, I choose to do this, but
there is a difference.

However, there is at least one
similarity in the whole thing —
nobody, not fans or writers, likes
to see a team lose.,And, for the
most part, this year's Panther

—hoop team hasn't let anyone

down. .

Consider a reward for a job well done

thosewho play for him, those
who write about him and those
who go to see him coach his
team.

”Winning is the name of the
‘game this year,” said Evans, and,
again for the most part, winning
it has been. In one season,,he has
taken what was a broken, brood-
ing, ramshakle team and deli-
vered it head first to the doors of
at least one ‘championship posi-
tion. Not bad, huh?

And don't think‘ his efforts
haven't gone unnoticed.

A recent survey has shown an
increase in Panther memorabilia

over 43 percent since this time

Editor's Note: The Big East Coach of the
Year Award was announced," yesterday,
and the recipient was john Thompson of
Georgetown.

Thompson's Hoyas team is currently
seeded first in the Big East going in to the
tournament with an overall record of 23-4
and a Big East record of 72-4.

He beat out such other favorites as Paul ‘

Evans of Pittsburgh, lim Boeheim of Syra-
cuse, and dark horse Rick Pitino of
Providence.

. This is the third time Thompson has

' been awarded the honor.

that will work. ’’I don't think Se-
ton Hall has the kind of inside
people to get Smith in trouble,”
added Evans.

That could spell doom for the
Pirates because Pitt's other inside
force hasn't had a bad game all
season. Sophomore forward Jer-
ome Lane, who was .named by
Basketball Weekly a third-team
All—American earlier this week,
has been the Panthers most con-
sistent player this year.

Car|esimo’s appraisals of Lane
are many. ”He’s the best offen-
sive rebounder I have ‘ever seen
—— 6-11, 7-0 foot, it doesn't mat-
ter; he's the best.”

As it has been manytimes this
season, the Smith-Lane combina-
tion might be just too much for
Seton Hall to handle..

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, March 5, 1987

Drabek may prove Ti.

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

BRADENTON, Fla. — Pitts-
burgh Pirates General Manager
Syd Thrift said he wouldn’t trade
a talented young right arm like
Doug Drabek’s for anything. But
the New York Yankees did.

In a deal that took nearly a year

to consummate — and the only

major trade Thrift has pulled off
in his 15 months on the job — the
Pirates sent 15—game winner Rick
Rhoden and two other pitchers to
the Yankees last November for
three young pitchers.

What finally convinced Thrift
to make the deal was the

' -Yankees’ willingness to part with

Drabek, a right-hander with only
one year's major league ex-
perience, and minor leaguer Lo-

.gan Easley, a relief sensation last

summer at Class AA Albany.
The trade has been criticized

_by other baseball executives,
who say the Pirates didn't get top-

line prospects despite giving up

one of baseball's best pitchers.
”There are only so many good

young arms available at any one

-time, and we think we have as

many as any team in baseball,”
said Thrift, defending the deal.
”You have to be excited when
you can trade for a pitcher like
Doug Drabek because he has
what you call potential.”

Reliever Brian Fisher, who had
14 saves in 1985, wasn't sur-
prised when the Yankees includ-
ed him in the deal. But he was
when he learned that Drabek, 24,
would accompany him to
Pittsburgh. '

”They need starting pitching,
yet they traded away one of the

best young pitchers they had,”
Fisher said. ”He’s got a strong
arm.” '

And, Drabek said, he has a
new pitch.

”l’ve always been a fastball,

slider pitcher,, but I've been-

working on a off—speed pitch this
spring,” Drabek said at Pirate
City. ”l’m anxious to see how it
works. [Pitching coach] Ray
Miller has stressed how important
an off—speed pitch is, and it's go-
ing to help every pitcher here.”

Drabek, who was 7-8 with a
4.10 ERA in 28 games last -sea-
son, said Pittsburgh has much
more in common with his
hometown of Victoria, Texas,
than New York.

”New York is a busy city, and
where I'm from is kind of slow,”
Drabek said. ’’I was in Pittsburgh

The 6-1_, 185—pound Drabek
was 12-5 at Class A Glens Falls

in 1984 and 13-7 at Class AA~Al--

bany in 198_5 before breaking
into the Yankees’ rotation last
season. He made 21 starts and
was 5-3 with a 2.91 ERA in his
last 11 appearances.

”l think I’m going to be a bet-
ter pitcher because I’m still learn-
ing how to pitch,” he said.
”That’s why I looked forward to
working with Ray Miller. I think
he's going to make me a better
pitcher and everybody on the
staff a better pitcher.”

rift’ s trade was smart

Houston, knows he will be com- .

pared to Rhoden because he will

be taking the right—hander’s spot .'

in the Pirates’ rotation.

”1 know I'm looking fon/vard to-

the season,” Drabek said. ’’I
don't think the fans will expect

4 me to be Rick Rhoden; they'll ex-

pect me to be me. I'm excited.”

Rhoden was the Pirates’ only
double-figure winner last season,
so Managerlim Leyland's starting
rotation won't include a pitcher

who won as many as 10 games,

in 1986.

’’It would look like our pitch-,
ing staff isn’t as good as last, year,
butl think we have a potentially
better staff,” Thrift said. ”People
in baseball have told me we have
as manygood, young pitchers as

any team in the major leagues'.”’
