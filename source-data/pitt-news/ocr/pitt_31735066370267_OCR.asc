Employment rate
dropping for blacks

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer and
Michael Ashford

Assistant News Editor

National Urban League officials
reported that blacks have not kept pace
with the rest of the country in any
economic recovery. The problem is
particularly severe in Pittsburgh.
according to the.Pinsburg/i Post-
Gazette.

In a report entitled “An Overview
of Black America in 1985.” the Urban
League said that racial economic ine-
quality is increasing and is greater now
than at any time since 1970.

In 1980, the unemployment rate for
whites in Pittsburgh was 6.6 percent,
while for blacks it was 14.2 percent.
In 1984, those ﬁgures rose to 9.9 per-
cent for whites and 34.5 percent for
blacks. 1

Leon L. Haley, executive director of
the Urban League of Pittsburgh, attrib-
utedlthe increase in black unemploy-
ment to a combination of economic fac-
tors and labor market trends. Never-
theless, Haley sees county-wide drops
in the steel and manufacturing in-
dustries as primary contributors.

“In 1980, 155,180 persons were
employed in manufacturing and by
1985 that ﬁgure fell to 101.683. In the
steel industry the number of persons
employed fell from 55,754 to 35,033
between 1980 and 1985. With black
unemployment concentrated in those
industries, this is probably the single
most contributing factor to black
unemployment in Allegheny County,”
Haley said.

Besides the decline in manufacturing

and steel, Haley noted more women
entering the labor force, overall racial
discrimination, a lack of adequate job
trainingand the failure of affirmative
action in industries like construction as
further factors contributing to rising
black unemployment rates.

Despite these statistics, President
Reagan remarked last Saturday that
blacks have enjoyed significant
prosperity during his administration. In

commenting on the effects of admin- -

istration policy on black employment,

— Haley pointed out that “as well as a

decline in support for families in pover-
ty. certain policies of anti-inﬂation will
also produce higher unemployment
overall.” '

Urban League National President
John S. Jacob said that Reagan’s budg-
et cuts have hurt programs for children,
young adults and the unemployed. In
1985, 51.1 percent of all black children
lived below the poverty line.

“The only difference in Pittsburgh
as concerns poor black children,”
Haley said, “may be in terms of the
amount of Aid to Families with Depen-
dent Children support broken down by
state and county. The problems and
patterns which create single-mother
households are higher in urban areas.
I reason that the rate is characteris-
tically high in Pittsburgh."

Among black teen—agers, the national
unemployment rate was 41 .6'percent.
Jacob said that unemployment of black
teen—agers is leading to a “rejection by
a frightening number of ‘black teen-

agers of the American dream of get— '

ting ahead by working hard and secur-
ing an' education." Black teen—age
unemploymentin Pittsburgh was also
41 percent. '

IFC seeks rights in
dry rush contoversy

By Liz Habib
For The Pitt News

The issue of dry rush has been mak-
ing the news frequently as of late and
the Greeks’ position on it might sur-
prise some people. The lnterfraternity
Council supports and “actively pro-
motes" a dry rush.

The conﬂict arises from the lFC’s
“decision to support recommendations
made by the Greek committee on
alcohol in 1983. The committee in-
cludes Terrence Milane, associate
director; Larry Lunsford, assistant
director; and Louise McLinden, assis-
tant director; all are from the Student
Activities office. Their recommenda-
tions have been governing rush ac-
tivities since l983. ’

The resolution states that the open
rush period should be considered an of-
ﬁcial program, and therefore it is under

the iurisdiction of the university and its ,

policies. The private functions (during
rush) that are by invitation only are
believed to be “outside the purview of
institutional authority and responsibili-
t .” ‘

The National Interfraternity Con-
ference resolution on alcohol deﬁnes
“open “parties” as those with
unrestricted access, andythey are pro-

r ‘ hibitcd if ‘centered around the consu'mp-  1

ft :..~;. '_.:.,;

 

tion of alcohol.
The IFC said it believes that the

‘university is violating its rights by not
- allowing private,

invitation only
parties.

“People look at this like were com-
plaining about not having alcohol at
parties,” said Rick Platt, IFC public
relations chairman. “The real issue is_
the right to have private functions for
the fraternity brothers — we don’t want
to get pushed around."

In support of the resolution on
alcohol, the IFC has instituted a
number of programs to educate
brothers and the community on alcohol
awareness. They appointed an Alcohol
Awareness committee which includes
the Brothers Against Drunk Driving
program.

The fraternities at the University of
Pittsburgh are highlyconcerned about
alcohol abuse and the committee was
formed as a part of a developing
program.

Even though the IFC is promoting a
non-alcohol rush, they will not remain
passive if they believe their rights are
being violated. They believe it is their
right to conduct private functions for
the brothers and their invited guests.

 According to the IFC,--the university

Libya — The White House said it
may spell out rules on how U.S. oil
companies should do business in Libya.
This comes after an investigation by the
Washington Post reported that some
companies avoided an embargo against
Libya by selling or loaning their pro-
duction equipment to oil firms from
other nations. Diplomats said the move
technically complies with Reagan’s
order against doing business with Libya
but effectively undercuts the embargo.
The White House said it was not aware
that the companies were undercutting
the embargo.

Syrian militia

Beirut -— Syrian-backed militias,

ted ﬂying reconnaissance missions over

the city. There were sporadic clashes

and sniper fire around two Palestinian
refugee camps in South Beirut, where
Palestinian and Shiite Moslems have
been fighting for two days.

Reagan meets
Angolan leader

Angola — President Reagan
welcomed Angolan rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi to the White House yesterday.
The administration has indicated that
it favors sending covert military aid to
the rebels in their bid to topple the

_ Cuban—backed government of Angola.

Conservatives in the capital favor overt
aid to show U.S. support for so—called
“freedom fighters. " Liberal opponents
warn that any military help will link the
United States with the South African
government, which is Savimbi’s main
supporter.

Challenger may hurt
shuttle program

Analysts within the aerospace in-
dustry said the Challenger tragedy
poses a clear setback to commerciali-
zation of space because it has thrown
off an ambitious launch schedule for
the year. The key now seems to be how
long of a delay will come before the
nation’s reduced space shuttle _fleet is
back in action.

Analysts said a delay of three months
would not be traumatic, but a six to

12-month delay might be. The impact_

will be felt by NASA and the com-
panies that depend on NASA for de-
velopment oftheir satellites. The shut-
tle was designed to be a workhorse —
the world’s first reusable space deliv-
ery wagon. Commercial customers
anxious to get satellites launched could
be forced to look for other ways of get-
ting into space. The most often men-
tioned alternative is Europe’s Ariane
rocket. It has been competing with the
space shuttle since its first commercial
launch in 1982.

government.

Networks receive
shuttle complaints

Television networks received hun-
dreds of complaints Tuesday from
viewers who were upset that daytime
soap operas were pre—empted by news
coverage of the explosion of the space
shuttle Challenger.

ABC entertainment spokesman Vic
Ghidalia said there always are some
viewers who complain when the soap
operas are pre—empted. He said, “it’s
not that these people are heartless. It’s
the repetition.”

Ghidalia said daytime viewers
watched the news coverage over and
over and wanted a break from shuttle
coverage. When programming was
pre—empted because of the assassination
of Egyption President Anwar Sadat,
ABC received 6,000 calls. NBC’s au-
dience research division said “a few”
viewers complained about the loss of
the soaps, but “it wasn’t heavy.” CBS
switchboards also recorded complaints.

IFC STATEMENT ON ALCOHOLAND RUSH

During the past few weeks there have been many rumors and (mostly) misconceptions about

the fraternities’ rush and its future. The Pitt News coverage has ranged from accurate and respon-
sible coverage of the whole story to tasteless sarcastic articles and even personal attacks against
the IFC President. For this reason the lnterFraternity Council wishes to clarifyia few things about
rush as well as the presence of alcohol at the fraternities.

First of all, the lFC’s position towards alcohol is as follows:

While the moderate and legal consumption of alcohol does not constitute a problem, the illegal use and abuse of alcoholic beverages
is widely recognized as a major problem in our society. As members of society and particularly the higher education community, the
fraternities of the University of Pittsburgh are highly concerned about alcohol abuse. As a result the lnterfraternity Council has-con-
stantly encouraged and encourages the development of educational programs which stress the potential dangers of alcohol abuse
and the advantages of responsible legal use of alcoholic beverages. For this purpose the IFC appointed a new committee, the Alcohol
Awareness Committee, which will include the “Brothers Against Drunk Driving” program. .

Furthermore, the |nterFratnernity Council shares and supports the NATIONAL INTERFRATERNITY CONFERENCE RESOLUTION ON '

ALCOHOL:
WHEREAS, The NIC House of Delegates and its member fraternities are concerned about the increasing consumption
and abuse of alcoholic beverages on college campuses, and V

WHEREAS, The dangers of misuse of alcohol to individuals, to groups, to the fraternity system and to the campus com-
munity are becoming increasingly evident, and,

WHEREAS, An affirmative program to deal with the problems will only be effective by common consent and unified
action, '

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the NIC that the following policies be adopted and be recommended to its
member organizations for their adoption:

1. That the possession, use, sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises of any chapter
or at any entertainment or function of any chapter shall be in compliance with all applicable laws.

2. I That moderation be encouraged during lawful consumption, and that chapters develop and support pro-
grams and those groups and organizations seeking to educate chapter members on alcohol awareness.

3: That open parties, meaning those with unrestricted access, where structured around thesale or consump-
tion of alcoholic beverages shall be prohibited.

4. That non-alcoholic rush shall be actively promoted on all campuses

5. That thereishall be no open solicitation or encouragement of alcoholic consumption by contest or promo-
tions in any chapter.

Second of all, the lFC’s position towards rush is as follows: " -

While we support the N|C’s Resolution on Alcohol and actively promote non—alcoholic rush, we also support the existing rush recom-
mendations of the 1983 Greek Committee on Alcohol Policy which states the following:

‘‘It is believed that only the open rush period should be considered an official program  The private functions by invita-
tion are believed to be outside of the perview of institutional authority and responsibility.”

As such, even though we are promoting a non—alcoholic rush, we can not stay passive against situations in which our rights are
being violated. As far as rush goes, alcohol is not the issue, but rather our right to conduct private functions for the fraternity brothers
and their invited guests. The |nterFraternity Council is determined to ensure that these rights will not be violated.

As a response to the comments regarding the necessity of alcohol for a successful rush, and whether or not there is anything besides
alcohol that the fraternities can offer to the rushees, we would like to say the following: . .

If you look at the variety of social interactions in a chapter, there is not a drink in hand at all times. One of the biggest concerns
of Greeks is that the general public views the fraternity as only a social club revolving around high alcohol consumption. This is a
big fallacy which is usually fueled by people who have never been to a fraternity, but they launch their negative comments anyhow.
Alcohol does not play even a minor role towards a rushee’s decision to join a fraternity. A rushee joins a fraternity because he feels
wanted, has made a friend and was impressed by the type of men he met. It is» chapter members that sell the rushee, not how big
the parties are or who has the most beer. Men join fraternities because of the brotherhood they feel and the way they are made to
feel at home and welcome. Basically, alcohol is not needed to sell a fraternity. The best part of any fraternity is its members. If the
lnterFraternity Council (which is the delegation of the fraternity presidents) insists on opposing a completely dry rush, this is because
we believe that our right to host private (closed) functions during rush as defined by the existing official rush policy, should not be violated.

Please address all comments and questions to the IFC, 628 William Pitt Union.

Herb may be

The Wisconsin-born actor who plays

be taken at face value and he especial-
ly doesn’t want his nerdy character to
reflect poorly on Wisconsin. Jon
Menick complained that people judge
Herb by his looks before they get to

know him. The folks in Menick’sV

hometown of Beaver Dam, Wis., who
do know him, gave Menick the keys

to the city at a homecoming Wednes— '

day. Menick also‘ said he was the one
who urged that Herb be identified as
being from the dairy state. Menick said
he wants the naive and nerdy Herb to
display the moral values and humor he
learned growing up in Wisconsin. He
said. “Wisconsin has a great sense of
humor — except maybe in January.”

of an emerging physician in training.

In the second and third years. em-
phasis is placed upon the performance.
delivery and administration of
emergency medical care in both pre-
and in-hospital settings. The educa-

« tional philosophy also includes oppor-

tunities for the residents to pursue
specialized training in hospital and pre-
hospital settings.’

The rotation schedule is set up so the
resident works in pediatrics one week
and in a coronary unit the next rotation.

 

The residents also have the experience

of stafﬁng the STAT (specialized treat-’

ment and transport) program which is
located in the Center for Emergency
Medicine. This program makes use of
specialized land and air transport
vehicles. including a Lear jet.
helicopters and ambulances.

The residents. Paris said. “spend 80
to 100 hours per week on their rota-
tion schedule and additional studying."

After the resident completes his
residency, he could find employment
in a hospital -or similar situation or con-
tinue his training through a fellowship.

 

The other opportunity the resident has
is to take the emergency medicine
board exam and receive a board cer-
tificate. ‘lvhich means he is officially‘
recognized as an emergency medicine
specialist by the emergency board.

’ The future of the residency program
depends upon a fspecialty more and
more accepted." said Paris. He also

commented that “better and brighter "

people“ would be entering the pro-
gram. The program also will be chang-
ing to keep pace with technological
changes, and the residents will become
involved with new machinery.

Needy Neglected

Federal programs might soon begin to feel the
impact of the Gramm—Rudman bill, a controver-
sial plan enacted by Congress late last year
designed to eliminate the federal deﬁcit by 1991.
Congress’s failure to implement-budget cuts of
its_ own for the fiscal year 1986 means that,
under the provisions of Gramm—Rudman, cuts
amounting to $11.7 billion will soon be initiated
automatically. Unless Congress comes up with

I its own cuts, Gramm—Rudman would force
President Reagan to order 4.3 percent cuts in
the budgets of each of 800 federal programs by
Feb. 1.

While a program for equal spending cuts
across the board might strike some as an
egalitarian measure, more careful thinkers will
see through this deceptive facade. In his term
of office, Mr. Reagan has already slashed the
budgets of many of the federally funded non-
military programs serving human needs, while
generously beefing up the defense budget.
Gramm—Rudman, by failing to address this un-
palatable undertaking, will continue to sanction
the starvation of many worthy social programs.
Thus will the poor and needy continue to suf-
fer for Mr. Reagan’s ill-advised arms buildup.

Gramm—Rudman will do little to obstruct Mr.
Reagan’s campaign to build bigger and better
missiles. The primary failing of this bill is that

I it does not strike at the mixed-up priorities

disseminated by the Reagan administration. Ex-
travagant and superﬂuous military spending is
yet given precedence over those programs de-
signed to serve the more urgent needs of the
American public.

  Brave of Heart

Peter Jennings said it best: “America
will stay in space. That is where
America belongs." Granted, in the face
of seven deaths, in the very shadow of
the darkest day in the history of U.S.
space exploration, those who chronical-
ly oppose NASA will undoubtedly
make their humanitarian appeals heard
more loudly than ever. But, in the
lamenting words of our somber presi-
dent. the future belongs not to the faint-
hearted but to the brave. One can
speculate’ that none of those seven
courageous pioneers would want us to
quit now. None would want us to turn
back after years of toil.

If America had abandoned her quest
for the stars following the 1967 tragedy
which took the lives of three astronauts,
men may never have walked on the
moon. The United States is not the
forerunner in space travel today — the
United States is not leading mankind
into the 21st century — the United
States is not the greatest nation in the
history of the world — because it
allowed disaster, no matter how terri-

Same Mold

1 am writing this in regard to the
editorial letter "Evil Russians” by
Mark Miller. To him. I can only say:
Who are ‘we to be pointing fingers‘? I
don’t mean to come over as a supporter
of Soviet ideologies. but justice must
prevail. If we are to call them evil, I
must say that we are of that same evil,
possibly worse. -

I hope he realizes that a good percen-
tage of all the coups and covert actions
of past and present are a direct result
of U.S. actions (primarily through the
CIA). Sure. the Soviets do their share
and I’m sure our government makes
known their actions. Otherwise, where

'_ would Mark get his specifics about the

Soviets (classified documents?)? On the
other hand, we work (or lurk) in the
shadows and let the ignorant do the
work. Remember the Bay of Pigs,
Chile (1973) or El Salvador, to name
just a few that we got caught in the mid-
dle of?

Maybe we should turn our covert ac-
tions into full-scale U.S. interventions.
Or, maybe as Americans, we should
respect the freedoms of life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness. be it in the

communist, socialist or any other ap-
proach. But, what do I know, I’ll prob-
ably be labeled subversive with com-
munist links for writing this. So, I
guess Mark was correct all along.
Never mind!

Unfair Allocations

I am writing in protest of some of the
Student Government Allocation
Board’s policies. As a student that
helps to pay for these funds, I feelthat
any monies designated to a student
group should be used for an activity
that can be potentially enjoyed by any
student, not only those restricted to
members of the group.

The gist of my letter stems from the
anger and shock I felt when I
discovered the following: underrated,
hardworking, approved student groups,
such as — but not limited to — Quo
Vadis, are not given any money by the
Allocations committee. Such organiza-
tions benefit the students, the school’s
image and the community year-round.
I’d bet you Allocation Board money
that many reading this letter don’t even
know what Quo Vadis, or the many
other deserving student groups, are.

Simply Speaking/Pat McCray

It’s Not For Everyone 

I was born in a small town. Not John
Cougar’s Seymore, but I'm sure mine
was just as small. Anyway, we never
had cable TV at home. Somehow. this
deﬁciency made me a bit insecure, like
driving your Impala through Shadyside
on a Saturday afternoon. I always felt
like my family didn’t fit the suburban
mold. This September a salesman
visited my new apartment offering 
cable TV. Seventy-nine stations plus
MTV — at last, a chance to redeem
myself and my ancestors.

Of the seventy-odd stations I
received (  spectacular entertainment
bargain for you and your family, all at
one low price  ), MTV caught. my
attention the most. MTV is a little like
an addictive drug. Even if you don’t
like the video being shown, most peo-
ple will keep watching in hopes of see-
ing a better one next. What does come
on next is fairly predictable. We are
proudly given Twisted Sister, Mr.
Mister. Madonna, Bryan Adams,

Twisted Sister, Whaml. Madonna.
Tina Turner. Wham! and lots of Lover-
boy videos. And if the executives feel
their audience is less than enthralled
and might be considering going to the
kitchen for some New Coke or
switching to ESPN for the roller der-
by, they will graciously hurl a classy
Starship clip into their viewers’ starry
eyes. Thejoys of “America's favorite
indoor sport" lie -in reasons other than
sheer repetition. I have witnessed a
decapitation by guitar in one heavy
metal video. Madonna fondles, pumps
and wriggles her way through MTV’s
rotation schedule. I’ve seen bands
shamelessly rip-off ideas that other
groups stole from someone else’s
video. Why, I have watched — nay,
gasped — as Dee Snider and his other
Twisted cohorts pretended to pee in the
Thames River for an MTV promo.
While I utterly despise the Washington
Wives and their attempts at music cen-
sorship, one can see where they may

 Neither Is Spring Break

About $120 -— that’s what one week
at a full—time, minimum wage job is
worth. Also it is what that extra week of
summer vacation is worth. It is a shame
to reduce things to economic terms, but
this is the real world. Some of us live on
our own and depend on summer work to

. get us through the lean school year.

The real world. The real world is made
up of priorities (at least mine is), and No.
1 for me is to eat and sleep in a warm,
dry place. The thought of spring break
in Florida has never crossed my mind —
I don’t really care. I like to get through
the term as quickly as possible. Sure, it’s
hectic, but personally, I thrive on
pressure — I do my best work under it.

One of the reasons I came to Pitt in the
first place was because the winter term
ended early. I liked that — a no—nonsense
school system. Go to school and get

through it with little distraction. Too
much break time is just a waste for me.
After a week or two, I’m ready to tackle
the winter term.‘ Anyway, I enjoy the
summer season a helluva lot more than
the winter. There is a lot more to do in
the summer. So why take more time off
in the winter and less in the summer? I
just can’t understand the logic behind this
kind of move.

Most importantly, I depend on my
summer earnings for living. I get ajump
on summer jobs this way. A spring break
might be nice (if you ‘can do anything
with it), but I bet most people could care
less. I even bet many people would like
to see thingsstay just the way they are. I

have a small point.

prime marketing audience. all of the
aforementioned wretchedness makes
sense. The network is directed at a
predominantly white. upper-class. 13-
to 16-year-old audience. And based on
the exposure of idols like Wham! and
Bryan Adams, much of the audience
must be female. Record companies see
the buying power of the 15-year-old
girl and realize the sway MTV has over
it. Take Duran Duran for example. For
a good two years, the band went
nowhere commercially. Once the
tenny-boppers realized what a cute guy
Simon LeBon was, the records sold like
hell. Much of this success was due _to
their videos. Music bigwigs saw their
instant stardom and since then Whaml.
Corey Hart, Bryan Adams, A-ha and
most recently, the Hooters, have
followed suit. The sad fact is that MTV,
caters directly to its-audience. Ideally,
the media should develop our apprecia-

pretty good grades), write an article every
so often and even see a movie now and
then (when I can afford it). I also keep
my sanity. Amazingly, I do this without
the beneﬁt of a spring break (as I am sure
many others do). V

Let’s take another approach. Consider
getting out of school earlier than
everyone else as a summer break. I ﬁnd
it much more enjoyable to be done with
ﬁnals and settling into ajob with all wor-
ries behind for four months. You can do
that during summer break, but you can’t
during spring break.

I know I am only giving my own views
here, but I doubt rm alone. There are
also faculty members concerned about
their research time being shortened by a
spring break.

I also would like to address CAS Dean
Irwin Schulman_‘s theory that our “com-

tion for art and creativity while
expanding our tastes and knowledge of
rocks roots. Instead, they appeal to
minimal tastes and maximum proﬁt. In-
stead. we get Billy Idol.

One could almost forgive MTV in its
corporate greed if it weren’t for the
warped values their videos project.
Look at Survivor's “Burning I-Ieart"
clip of “Rocky IV" fame. Recently.
this video reached the No. -1 spot in
MTV’s rotation. Along with being sub-
jected to an unpleasant blast of bom-
bastic music, we are treated to Sur-
vivor‘s nihilistic lyrics and Rambo-
mentality visuals. I-Iere, while Survivor
muses over whether “one nation can
stand alone," we see clips of Rocky
IV. a movie for the red—blooded.
Apple-pie-eater in us all. We see the
underdog boxer going up against a
sneaky, not-to-be trusted, steroid-using
mammoth Commie. David ﬁghts clean
while nasty, ‘stupid Goliath kills
helpless American in the ring. As a

\
pressed schedule” here at Pitt is short-
changing Pitt students. Just because every
other major university has a longer
schedule doesn’t mean we also have to!
Be a rebel! I think that the fast pace keeps
students interested (it does for me). It also
makes a person push himself and test his
personal limits. I know I have discovered

more about my own capabilities by

pushing myself past old limits. Pardon the
philosophy.

Interestingly, a recent Pitt News arti-
cle included interviews with several dif-
ferent groups of people. Of the students".
only one wanted a longer Christmas vaca-
tion and no one wanted a spring break.
The student said that all of her friends
were home for a whole month, but she
had to return after only two weeks. Most
of my friends are envious that Pitt gets

Porno becoming more popular in U.S.

By Adam Eisenstat
For The Pitt News

On Wednesday film Professor Lin-
da Williams from the University of II-
linois gave a lecture at Pitt entitled
“Film Bodies: The Origin of Porno.”

Citing early scientific and film ex-
periments, Williams said that the will
to know how the human body actually
looks and behaves in motion has. from
the beginning, overlapped with the
pleasure of the body as a spectacle.

Professor Williams said that there is
a fundamental curiosity in looking at
bodies. especially those of women. In
early motion studies of men and
women. the men always were depicted
as doing something practical “with ox-
likc resolve." said Williams. The
women in the studies, however, often
were embellished with unnecessary
props and sometimes were frozen in
static shots, which contradicted the idea
of the motion study.

Williams emphasized the importance
of rationally analyzing the underlying
structures and origins of pornography
because-many porn ideas of sexuality
and male/female relationships have in-
filtrated the society at large, especial-
ly in advertising, which she illustrated
in a slide presentation.

 

“Porn is so pervasive in our country. Madison Avenue -
and high fashion are no longer merely sexy, but ag-
gressively exhibitionist and overtly sexual. ”

— Linda Williams

"Porn is so pervasive in our coun-
try,“ she said. “Madison Avenue and
high fashion are no longer merely sexy.
but aggressively exhibitionist and
overtly sexual.”

Unlike radical feminist critics of por-
nography, like Andrea Dworkin. who

condemn all pornography as misogyny I

and a perverse, explicitly violent ex-
pression ofa society rooted in patriar-
chal dominance, Williams does not
believe outright condemnation and cen-
sorship is the right approach for women
who wish to address the problem of
female objectification.

Williams discussed the theories of
French philosopher Michel Foucault.

_ who said that the history of sex is a

history of power structures intertwined
with, and mediating, pleasure struc-
tures. By this definition, she said, no
essential definition of sex exists and
sexual definitions and relationships
change with the power structures.
For Foucault, she explained, sex is
constructed by the many discourses on

it from a variety sources. For this
reason, she said, he believes that such
supposedly fundamental truths like
"sexual liberation for all," are illu-
sions, sustained by rhetoric and part of
the machinery of power that encroaches
on allforms of sexual discourse.
According to Williams. the cliche
that “all porn is the same” is not true.
Although there is a narrative structure
and mechanistic quality common to
most hardcore porn, differences do ex-
ist in how female pleasure is illustrated.
Unequivocal male pleasure can be il-

lustrated by the “money shot” which
shows the male ejaculating externally.
usually on some part of the woman’s
body. Implied in this sequence is that
both parties are satisfied. The money
shot usually ends a scene or an entire
film. »

Williams said that some recent porn
films have sex scenes where male
ejaculation is internal rather than ex-
ternal. Some also depict women as
visibly unsatisfied even after male
ejaculation has taken place. Although
Williams said she did not see this new
awareness of female pleasure as an im-
provement in a medium where “exag-
gerations of virility are really an op-
pressive model.” she said it is some in-
dication that pornography is not
necessarily the monolithically cruel.
theoretical rape of women that radical
feminists say it is.

The one|yEntpris ofrimenal Filmmi

By Matthew Yokobosky

in recent years, American television
has become the nested home for many
fledgling video artists; in that, ex-
perimental filmmakers undertook the
medium of video as a public and com-
mercial enterprise. Through these ar-
tists’ adaptation to correlate their
visuals with popular music, recognition
and financial support have afforded
them the luxury of pursuing their
ambitions.

If one then applied our conception
of “media” to Japanese culture, vi-

inside

 

Music
Dylan’s Biograph preserves a
good-sized chunk of rock history
and leads off our album reviews
as well. i

sions of a land overrun by technol-
ogical wizardry may come to mind, due
to American advertisements of Japan-
ese televisions. Likewise, one may
then assume that their culture would
support film- and video-makers in the
experimentation of the mediums’ ver-
satility; but the response is “iee’-’ (no).

On January 24, Mako ldemitsu pre-
sented her “Great Mother” trilogy at
Pittsburgh Filmmakers lnc,. after a
successful screening of her videos at
the Museum of Modern Art, NYC.
What makes her appearance in Pitts-
burgh intriguing, is that Mako is the on-
ly female, experimental filmmaker in

Japan, and one of only five female ex-
perimental videomakers in her coun-
try. Granted, proportionally, female
American media artists are few in rela-
tion to their male counterparts, but to
acknowledge that her voice within their
filmindustry is solo, raises many ques-
tions. is Japan’s positioning of women
steadfast to their cu|ture’s traditional
viewpoint? Are women denied the right
to display opinions?

Mako began her film career in
California, where _she resided with her
first husband for a number of years.
Upon returning a divorced woman to
her native Japan, Mako began to look

for support of her newly realized

fascination, though to no avail. Unlike ,

America’s National Endowment for the
Arts, Japan does not have a govern-
ment organization sponsoring artistic
experimentation, leaving Mako and her
colleagues to independently sustain
the finances needed to accomplish
their self-denied tasks. As such, the
amount of footage she can film and
tape is limited, as is the "number of her
resulting works. Though, Mako did
state that she creates one film per year
for exhibition in the image Forum -——’an

experimental film festival.

—A different shade-
—+ of Purple——

Dear Mr. Yokobosky,

In the January 10 edition of The Pitt
News you cite the occurrences in the
life of a fictional character named Celie
from the movie The Color Purple as be-
ing the “perennial victimization that
many black, Southern women endured

—during the early 20th century.” It is

very touching to witness such sensitivi-
ty in another human being, but I feel
the sensitivity in this instance is unwar-
ranted; True, black women have gone
through much subjugation and oppres-
sion, but, typically, it has been at the
hands of others, not their race. Alice
Wa|ker’s book and the movie adapted
from it are fictional. The characters
have very little to do with the real-life
experiences of anyone. She uses her
characters to relate to the reader on a

universal level of humanity and, in
some instances, to express feministic
viewpoints. Yes, indeed, there were
probably many black women who
[have] suffered under the same yoke
Celie suffered under, but their strug-
gle with a divergent society over-
shadowed and sometimes precipitated
any conflict within their personal lives
or at least attempted to cause such
discord. l for one fail to see the black
orientation you claim existed in the
film. The film was about people. The
suffering of the female characters, the
lesbianism and the characterization of
black males in this film was not done
to enlighten the world about the human
condition. It would be unfair to view all
black males as having been the ogre
Mr. was or Celie’s Pa. Even the movie
shows not all males were that way and
even Mr. showed a different aspect of-
himself in the end of the movie —- as

_ did Shug Avery’s father. The occur-

rences depicted in The Color Purple
cross racial boundaries or were, at

‘     _‘ Letters   —

 

 

least, intended to cross them and give
insight into relationships. Persever-
ance and self-realization are more so
the keys to this piece than anything
else.

Please understand, I am not trying
to take away your right to critique the
picture as you wish. The points I am
making have been argued pro and
con, again and again. History may
have acted as a springboard for this

- movie, but from there it was a matter

of pure creative genius.

watched it happen with him. I know
where he writes about and what he
writes about. Have you, Mr. Morrison,

' -ever seen Freehold, N.J.? (Freehold is

Springsteen’s hometown, in case you
didn’t know that.) Maybe you don’t
think there is substance in “My
Hometown,” but tell the people of
Freehold that. l’m not saying “My
Hometown” is the greatest song ever
written. In fact, it’s not even on my list
of top 100 favorites. But to say there
is no substance behind it, well, maybe
if you never heard of Freehold or
Asbury Park. Or even seen any of
Eastern Central Jersey to have the
slightest idea of what’s going on in
many of his songs?

Misguided nationalism? I do believe
that if Bruce Springsteen was out to
misguide the nation, or even if he just
wanted popularity, he would have

when he released his first (Did you
ever hear of Greetings from Asbury
Park, N.J.?) Or he would have given up
long ago. The only reason people may
fail to see the ironic undercurrents in
7‘Born in the U.S.A.” (and l’|l assume
you are speaking of the single since
the title is in quotes, although I don’t
know what on earth it was doing in
your article. I thought you were re-
viewing “My Hometown,” not various
Bruce songs!) is because they don’t
want to look for them or, if they have
looked for them, fall to recognize them
as real. He hasn’t created anything but
an expression of the truth, however
brutal, through his songs. The public
has created the rest. 1

Perhaps you don’t care to hear
about Springsteen’s hometown. But

then again, I don’t care to listen to you _

tear apart a man’s character (any man,
not just Springsteen) for being honest
with what he writes. Next time, stick to

bage like hers can be printed in an
entertaining music section. I don’t

I know where she gets off accusing

MTV of airing “racist” videos. First of
all, MTV’s programming is based on
the top 40 hits at the time and they

have no control of what they are. '

Secondly, MTV doesn’t -make the
videos, the performers do, whom she
also accuses of this nonsense. ‘
Miss Stetler states that white per-

formers employ black backup vocalists
for stereotypical images to help their
music sell. is she serious? There aren’t

any stereotypes of this sort in music, -

and I doubt there ever [were]. The
reason there are performers using
black vocalists is because black
vocalists are more talented [for sing-
ing] the way the performer intended.
Take Pete Townsend for instance —
he employs, black female backup
vocalists simply because the sound is
an important part of his music, which
is strongly influenced by blues, not
because stereotypes help sell his
record.

Another thing that. grabs me is the
fact that Carrie know-it-all Stetler ac-
tually accuses white musicians of
stealing, borrowing or transforming
black forms of music. is she racist or
what? Hey dear, it’s called freedom.
Just because someone invents
something it doesn’t mean no one else
can use it. Would it be fair for me to
say that black performers shouldn’t be
allowed to sing rock n’ rool because
it’s mainly a white form of music? No,
because it’s a racist remark and [is]
untrue, right Miss Stetler?

She also says its a shame that MTV
doesn’t show videos like those on the
Black Entertainment Network. Talk

I about discriminating, I haven’t seen a

white performer in any video on BEN.
At least MTV plays videos where it

doesn’t. matter what color the per-.

formers are. -

I know when I buy a record that I buy
it for the music, the performer’s color
has nothing to do with it. What is your

problem, /girl? I sure as heck can't .

figure [out] what her problem is but I

suggest she keep her nonsense to ,

herself and that she doesn’t write such
garbage again. Miss Stetler, get your
facts straight first. By the way, you

‘were right on the one thing —‘ it was

tiresome for me to read.

Dear Chet, .

While your intentions are admirable,
we are certain that a closer look at rock
history and the “facts” would force you
to reconsider your position.

  Bob Dylan

Biograph:

BIOGRAPH
Bob Dylan
Columbia Records

There would be precious few lovers

of great literature who never picked up i

on the writings of Hemingway. Nor
would there be art connoisseurs who
never seriously studied the works of
Picasso or Van Gogh. But it is sadly
true that a great number of serious
rock listeners have ignored the large
body of work that Bob Dylan has
amassed over the past 25 years.

Oh, you say that you are familiar
with some of the man’s music. Maybe
you kinda like “Mr. Tambourine Man,”
but you really prefer the Byrds’ ver-
sion. Most likely you're a little scared
of Dylan, though, because you once
had a zombie of a neighbor who used
to play Dylan eight-tracks in his VW
bus. .

Well, face it kids, by the time Bob
Dylan was 25 years old, he had
changed the face of rock music
forever. Rock.‘n’ roll had more to of-
fer than “Louie, Loule;” it could stir the
mind as well as the body. The fact that
hisgifts have survived into the ’80s,
evident in last year’s Empire Bur-
lesque, proves his lasting genius.

I know, you’ve heard this all before,
but if you need the evidence, Colum-
bia Records will provide you with what
is the definitive Dylan collection to
date.

Biograph contains 53 of Dylan’s best
known singles and album tracks mixed
in with well-chosen outtakes and a few
unreleased live performances. The
album is a cross-section of his more

The Confession

TWITCH
Aldo Nova
Portrait Records

I think all new music listeners have
their guilty musical pleasures, the stray
Rick Springfield of REO Speedwagon
albumin amongst more progressive,
innovative offerings. l myself harbor a
hard-to-explain affinity for the music of
the AOR radio-ready singerlguitaristl
keyboardist Aldo Nova.

Nova essentially plays pleasant,
borderline, trite love songs with a
melodic hard rock edge. But Aldo’s
distinctive, energetic vocal delivery
and knack for finding hot, catchy chord
progressions gloss over his lack of
lyrical inventiveness. Still, when I went
to listen to Twitch, Aldo Nova’s first
record in two years, I wondered if my
liking of this man’s previous work
wasn’t more a product of adolescent
ignorance than a careful consideration
of,Nova’s songs. Repeated listenings
of Twitch, however, have only reaf-
firmed my |ogic—defying like of Aldo
Nova’s music.

While a few tracks melt into each
other with their middle-of-the-road rock
sameness (“Rumours Of You,”
“Heartless,” “Fallen Angel”) many
fine cuts stand out. The instrumental
title track speeds along to a massive
beat with Nova ripping a flashy solo

over the synths, while “Tonite (Lift Me ‘

Up)” flies thanks to its bright, clear
keyboaredsvand sharp, distorted guitar

 

than 500 recordings that could serve
as a great introduction to Dylan’s art.
But Biograph could satisfy even ardent
Dylanophiles.

Digital remastering makes all of his
original recordings sound fresh,
especially the Highway 67-era
material. Al Kooper’s prominent organ
lines suggest a demented carnival at-
mosphere on “Please Crawl Out Your

Window,” which was previously avail-

able in the United States only as an
out-of-print single. Another rarity which
appears is the country—blues, “Mixed-
Up Confusion,” Dylan’s first 45. Long
unavailable tracks such as these make
Biograph a must for collectors who
would have paid up to $100 a piece for
these out-of-print singles.

The greatest discoveries on Bio-
graph are the 18 never released Dylan
performances. Among the best is
“Percy’s Song” (1965). It is a touching
narrative of judicial insensitivity and
was originally covered by the British
folk-rock group, Fairport Convention.

If there’s a personal favorite among
these tracks,- it’s “Abandoned Love.”
The song is an outtake from 1975’s
Desire, an album that expressed
Dylan’s frustration over his
disintegrating marriage. In this
unusually personal piece, he sings,
Everybody’s wearing a disguise/ To
hide what’s left behind their eyes  The
Spanish moon is rising on the hi/// But
my heart is telling me, I love you still.
It is not often that Dylan letsus share‘
his pain. '

My only complaint about this release

chords. The obligatory slow song
proves an unusually hopeful one;
“Surrender Your Heart” builds up in-

to lush, textured choruses. “Lay Your '

Love On Me” rocks the hardest of the
album’s tracks, thumping along to a
king~size backbeat, and featuring a
slick, uncredited guest vocal on the
choru . t

    

The .music of Twitch definitely
qualifies as hard rock, but the variety
of shimmering keyboard sounds Nova
|iberally_ implements on each track
keeps his powerchords and breakneck
solos from growing stale. The record’s
lyrics rate as standard fare from Aldo
Nova, barely being rescued from the
oblivion of hopeless cliches Nova en-
thusiastically sings. Call it pop metal,
call it ’70s rock; but nevertheless,

Nova’s music remains innately’
, listenable. ’

I have no apologies about liking Aldo!
Nova’s music. In fact, if you pass by
my. dorm room, you may occasionally

 

is that Columbia continues to hoard
unreleased and legendary Dylan ma-
terial like his 1966 Royal Albert Hall
concert. Biograph is an intelligent and
satisfying portrait of Bob Dylan. It
should not, however, act as the defini-

catch an Aldo Nova record playing
away among my more characteristic
U2, REM'and Husker Du albums.
Though, the question l now must face,
is how does one face all the Night
Ranger fans l’ve berated for so long?

Stevie Nicks:
breakin’ hearts

ROCK A LITTLE
Stevie Nicks
Modern Records

There breathes somewhere
underneath Stevie Nicks’ mysterious-
ly calm exterior a heart that’s been
broken time and time again. That's
okay, really, since we’ve been given
proof positive in the past that she’s a
girl who can get over heartbreak within
the wink of an eye" (“Stand Back,”
“Stop Draggin’ My Heart Around”).
But even with those songs, Nicks has
kind of a perilous quiver in her voice
which suggests a vulnerability, a girl
sometimes made of leather, but more
often made of lace. .

RockA Little is an interesting experi-
ment for Stevie Nicks. For once, she’s
stepped outside the arena of love and
anchors her feet on firmer ground. You
get the feeling she’s recorded RockA
Little lounging in aicourtroom, dress-
ed, in a black robe and pounding a

tive word on the artist. There is a great
wealth of his material awaiting. Any fan
of rock music undeniably owes Dylan
a listen.

gavel. Not that she’s making
judgments, but she is dishing out ad-
vice like a spiritual Ann Landers.

In “No Spoken Word,” she
repeatedly tosses in the comment,
Let’s make a deal here. In “The
Nightmare,” she’s thrown down
through the arms of sleep. She once
again lurks on mystical ground, offer-
ing: You cannot know a dream/Until

you’ve known the nightmare. in “Talk (

To Me,” she openly acknowledges a
conversation, which she deems
necessary, from her lover: You can talk
to me/You can set your secrets free,
baby. On Rock A Little, she plays a
rock ‘n’ roll psychiatrist; it may be her
most comfortable role yet. ‘
Indeed, “Talk To Me” is really a
Stevie Nicks masterpiece. She talks
out the song in a comforting tone, sure-

voiced and sentimental. Produced by ‘

Jimmy Lovine and Chas Sandford, her
unrelenting roar is reduced to an earth-
quake of sensitive murmurs (Lovine,
who produced portions of Joan Jett’s
last effort, borrows from Jett’s nasal,
bass-fired delivery). And Nicks rocks a
little on the opening cut ‘‘I Can’t Wait,”
“Some Become Strangers,” (which is
the only song from the album that
sounds anything like Fleetwood Mac)

. and “lmperia| Hotel,” an intriguing col-t L T 

laboration Nicks rocks out with Tom
Petty’s Heartbreaker band.

“Sister Honey,” fired by impressive _

guitar work from Les Dudek, tells a
story of a fortuneteller whose strange
fascination is some kind of temptation.

Millionaires, the Whitemans are.
Barbara Whiteman (Bette Midler) is
running frantically through her Bever-
ly Hills mansion, trying desperately to
keep her breasts inside a low cut eve-
ning gown, and screaming “call 911,
call 911.” David Whiteman (Richard
Dreyfuss), owner of a clothes hanger
industry, is hanging out at the beach
with the local riffraff. He’s drinking
cheap whiskey, enjoying the lowlife
rendition of We are the bums, we are
the homeless, an absurd takeoff of
USA for Africa.

Actually the Whitemans did ‘have a
storybook life: a perfect house, a
perfect family, even a perfect dog. But
life does a double take when a Bever-
ly Hills bum (Nick Nolte) attempts to
commit sucide in their swimming pool.
Being the courageous soul David
Whiteman is, he saves the vagrant’s
life, cleans him up and offers him a
home with the rest of the family. That’s
the premise of Paul Mazursky’s Down
and Out in Beverly Hills.

bargain novel. But director Mazursky
has this wonderful anything-can-
happen-in—Beverly-Hills attitude sus-

 

thousands of miles from their Chicago
home. When the rather obnoxious,
short-tempered, landlady, who has
been left fully in charge of Natty,
decides to turn her in to the authorities,
Natty leaves. _ ,

Upon leaving Chicago she finds
herself face-to-face with a world full of
danger and mystery. She forages
through a series of adventures that

little girl,‘ but with spunk and courage
she pulls through. Qualities such as

Beverly Hills; propelling this comedy to
amusing heights. He never makes fun

- of his characterizations, never lets

"them fall below the level of credulity,
and the viewers are with him through
every twist of fate. -

One of the reasons it works is that
these actors take themselves serious-
ly. They’re rich, but only in one sense
of the word. They’re crazy, but they’re
full of heart and soul. In one of the
most insightful scenes of the film,
Dreyfuss and Nolte exchange stories
at the beach. Nolte proves he’s not the
aimless wanderer everyone believes
him to be, by reciting Ham|et’s
“quintessence of dust” soliloquy. And
surprisingly there is an eminent bond
between the two, even after Nolte beds
his maid, his wife and his daughter.

The main problem with Down and
Out in Beverly Hills is that it takes some
time to get off the ground. it recalls
Robert A|tman’s A Wedding in its abili-
ty to jump from scene to scene without
losing any laughs, but the beginning
of the film staggers some, due to
Mazursky’s shifting from Nolte’s alleys
to the stately Whiteman residence. Ap-
parently, Mazursky is trying to
establish the dissimilarity of the two op-
posing environments. When the

against her: she hops a train that blows

. up in the middle of nowhere; she is at-

tacked by a middle-aged pervert; and
she is thrown, literally, into an
orphanage. :

The relationship between Natty and
“Woof” is a true example of Disney’s
classic affection for animals. They ex-
hibit an overwhelming closeness, the
kind that exists only between the best
of friends. Some of the scenes were so
warm and endearing, yet dangerous,
that you crossed your fingers hoping
that fate was on their side.

grows is Harry’s with Natty. Their af-

don’t know who it will be, but you’re

Richard Dreyfuss, looking pale and
unconcerned, sometimes overplays
the comedy, but his performance is an
innocent, winning one. Bette Midler,
falling short of camping it up with flail-
ing arms and her shaking ass, proves
that with the right role, she’s a come-
dienne that Hollywood will have to
acknowledge. Nick Nolte’s transition
from bum to elite Beverly Hills’
houseguest is all the more commend-
able given its incredulity. And even the
supporting players are fine, particularly
Little Richard who pops up as the
neighbor across the street, irked at the
Beverly Hills police for their prompt-
ness in answering the Whiteman’s
alarm (“I don’t get no helicopter. I
don’t get no dogs”).

Down and Out in Beverly Hills is a
fun, engaging and ironical comedy ex-
ercising the inane Beverly Hills men-

finity begins as a battle, but eventual-
ly the disparate attitude of each
softens by the end. Meanwhile Natty’s
father (Ray Wise) is in obvious agony
throughout the movie. Will Natty be
all right? What have I done? He is torn
by his guilt so harshly that his own life
becomes worthless and seemingly
expendible.

“The Adventures of Natty Gann” is
a straightforward film; the plot is sim-
ple. Natty has one goal, finding her
father; nonetheless, it is splendidly well
made and worth seeing. it is a clean
movie — no filth, no blood, just down
to earth family entertainment. Be a

Experimental
— F | I m umtiimed from page 7

Before beginning her video presen-
tation Friday, Mako explained her in-
terest in Jungian psychology as the
premise for her continual use of televi-
sions within her videos. Televisions
assume the position of the character’s
inner thoughts, thus creating dual nar-
ration. She seems to feel that our in-

ner drives and thoughts are not directly ‘

communicated through language. 80
while the main narrative is speaking,
television conversation is over-dubbed
to create a dual world of inner and
outer voices. And to further complicate
the audio, English translations were
dubbed over the original Japanese,
creating a unique aural sensation, that

being the simultaneous hearing of’

English and Japanese. In the delightful
“A Husband, A Wife, A Lover,” a

V‘ ‘ woman describes her future life as a

wife to her intended husband, while a
television screen positioned between
them in bed, contradicts her thoughts.
At one point the intended wife breathily
wimpers, “Our marriage won’t’ be like

’ others, because we’re intellectuals.”

While the television man extolls, “does
the flavor of culture taste good,”
receiving laughter from the entire
audience.

In her native Japan, home videos
are a national craze, with festivals
organized to award the most humor-
ous of the year. In response, Mrs.
ldemitsu made her own “home video,”
in which a family communicates to its
son on a television, when he is taken
hostage by a video company. We see
mom tapping the TV to wake Junior
and then sitting down to breakfast with
her televised son at the edge of the
table, eating his Cheerios. Then in the
last scene, mama phones her son to
come home, but he refuses. ln utter
rage, she slams down the receiver,
turns off the television and covers the
set. If life was only as simple.

Finally, she showed two parts of her
“Great Mother” trilogy. In response to
the Japanese chi|dren’s refusal to at-
tend school —— a national problem —
Mako pursued to contrast traditional

culture with modern domestic rela-

tions. Each part of the trilogy is a dif-
ferent stage _in the family’s aging.- In

 

the third, a young woman is shown
sleeping while her husband thrusts for
pleasure, then proceeds to roll over
when he finishes.- The next day she re-
counts the incident to her mother, to
which she responds, “You can’t avoid
a wife’s duty.”

   

In

It is thus established that perhaps
tradition will nevercompletely escape
Japanese culture. Will women ever be
recognized as men’s equals? Mako
seems to believe that they will. At 40,
she considers herself a “liberated
woman.” Though in comparison to
American women, Mako" would only be

viewed as contemporary. But, in view
of Japanese conservatism, Mako is
making strong strides in the advance-
ment of women in the arts.

As for the style of her videos, the
editing was essentially minimalistic
compared to American rapid, action
cutting. Though culturally our films are
read differently, it seems that in light
of experimental cinema, her editing
suffered as a result of.the lack of
editing equipment and time. It ap-
peared that through the lack of foot-

age, due to monetary constraints, she ,
' ‘carefully preserved what was essential

for continuity, sacrificing style and shot
composition. In terms of narrative,
though, the themes she is exploring
are completely understood, which is a

~ major problem in most experimental

cinemas. Mako is solidly revering that
experimental does not have to denote
obscurity.

Japan: a world where families play
“wave” tapes at dinner as opposed to
mood music; a country that has only
one female experimental filmmaker; a
country exploring the unlimited.

God help us if Armageddon is

What a dreadful scenario it would

‘in hopes of seeing a good black com-
edy about nuclear holocaust. ‘In the
middle of the first act, however, they
realize that the play’s frustrated author
has dragged the atomic bomb into the
theater only because he could not
think of a more subtle theme with
which to excite the audience. Instead
of exploding and killing everyone with
laughter, this bomb detonates slowly
like a bad situation comedy or an
episode of Nightline, boring fidgety
patrons to death with bad one-liners,
dry editorializing and apat moral.
The plot of Arthur Kopit’s
autobiographical play The End of the
World centers around a frustrated
playwright who is commissioned by a
paranoic old millionaire to write out the
old man’s conception of World War III.

lwas on a long, longjourney.  No,
that won’t work. l’|| just tell you the

- truth. l’ve been writing this column all

year. The first few articles were con-
cerned purely with style. Then, I sort
of strayed and began to write about

clining the offer with the following
monologue: “People who write plays
are a little crazy. They don’t do it for
money; they do it because it matters.
If it doesn’t — it’s gone.”

The dilemma of an artist whoring
himself is only the beginning of The
End of the World. Not content_to pat
himself on the back for being a
“playwright because it matters,” Kopit
makes it the main character’s moral
responsibility to save the world by a-
lerting people, via his plays, of the
dangers of nuclear stockpiling. Thus,
fueled by this sense of purpose, Mike
Trent, the playwright, is driven to
research this thermonuclear thing.
Along the way he confers in secret with
important bureaucrats who treat him
(and the audience) to a lengthy and,
detailed explanation of contemporary
world politics. Their logic runs
something to the effect of: We would
never use the bomb offensively, but
they might, so out of defense we have
to get them first before they blow us
up. The absurdity of this is dwelled
upon ad nauseam until a few allusions
concerning the dangers of power are
instituted in the play’s less than climac-
tic message.

tant topics. I have to tell you that I was

Since the issue of disarmament isn’t
as hot as it was two years ago when
the play somehow managed to
premiere on Broadway, The End of the
World lacks the typical interest it might
once have had. Even then, l’m sure
the play still would seem pretty awful
because controversial debates are a
bore in the theater. We"_ live in a socie-
tv where there is always a panel
discussion on TV. This is why we have
The Phil Donahue Show. If a play is
political, its politics should be implied
through dramatic action, not recita-
tions of newspaper clippings. If
playwrights want to somehow depict
the senselessness of anything, their
absurdism should be more ingenious
and colorful than Kopit manages. He
often substitutes inopportune slapstick
for true dark comedy. For instance, he
has two homosexual
demonstrate missile launching with
poultry and vegetable props. This is
funny and makes their rather technical
description more palatable, but the

-scene is prolonged and the flying broc-
coli isn’t funny after a while. Such
characters were a more sucessful ex-
ample of the play’s comic relief, but
they were wasted here, as were many

other flamboyant supporting
characters. A stiff-necked butler and

loudmouth Jewish agent also got lost

in the shuffle.

The best character was that of’

Trent’s hard-nosed but maternal
literary agent. Such an unconventional
figure is a pleasant surprise in a play
filled with stereotypes. Actress Mary
Craig fleshed out the part of Audrey
with wry humor and a flustered sense
of practicality. G.W. Roony, as Trent,

was a little inappropriate for the part"

of a hard-boiled writer/detective, as he
wasn’t tough enough to be Mike Ham-
mer or soft enough to be a parody of
Mike Hammer.

The major flaw of this production,
however, is the play itself, not the -

casting, acting or direction. The set
was particularly clever: people often
appeared as props (a coat rack, for ex-
ample, or a telephone booth). For a
local production of a weak, contempo-
raneous work, The End of the World is

not bad, but potential audiences would-

fare better with a poor adaption of a
classic rather than a competent
rendering of — a bomb.

Alice sashayed curtly into the
bedroom, threw down the last of her
diet cola in hard gulps and tugged im-
patiently at the vexatious cotton briefs
creeping between her buttocks.
Frumpy in her coffee-stained robe, the
buxom young housewife belched

Airships, by Barry Hannah, is a col-
lection of 20 vividly portrayed and
largely compelling short stories. The
reader is bombarded, story after story,
with original characters and situations
spanning the full gamut between the
offbeat and the truly bizarre.

With every story the author shifts
direction. He is able to engage you
again and again, before you are able
to air any previous dissatisfaction.
Here lies the strength of Airships.
While many of these stories fall short
in one way or another, often with weak
resolution, they are well-paced and
diverse enough to keep the reader
feeling fresh and interested.

Alice lolled about voluptuously,

She took a bonbon from the open box
on the nightstand and placing it be-

linger there before taking it into her
mouth. Her eyelashes fluttered
languidly as she surrendered herself
to the joys of daytime drama.

disconcerted and exclaimed, “How
dare unpleasant reality intrude on my
dreams of romance, adventure and

ruined, Alice became petulant. She
peevishly switched off the TV, enter-

Tom Brokaw’s fingertips with spike-

heeled shoes, and threw herself cross-
ly onto the bed.

But Alice was incapable of re-
maining angry for long; the world, she
imagined, was arranged for her ex-
clusive pleasure and already the mo-
tion of the waterbed had begun to
arouse her. She reached across the
bed to the nightstand and picked up

The Pittsburgh Ballet Theater will per-
form two world premieres Feb. 6-9 in
a program that also features one of
Ba|anchine’s master works,
“Serenade.” One of the premieres,
entitled “TabuIa Ftasa,” has been
choreographed by Ohad Naharin —
whose dancing and choreographical
credentials are discussed in the follow-
ing Showcase interview. Occasionally
Naharin also teaches at the. Juilliard
School and New York University.

’  Showcase: Mr. Naharin, would you

care to discuss your early dance train-
ing in Israel? ‘

Naharin: Well, my formal training
began with the Bat Sheva Company
after I finished my service in the Army.
I had a lot of prior exposure to the arts
through my parents. And when I was
young I did a lot of gymnastics and folk
dancing but I had no formal early train-
ing in dance.

Showcase: Well, that’s interesting,

. because I thought that to be a really
" premier dancer, you had to start at an

early age.

Naharin: No, there’s no rules for danc-
ing really. It depends on what kind of
body you have, but there are no
recipes for success.

Showcase: So you never really started
dancing till you were out of the Army.
Then you must have been about 21
years old.

Naharin: Almost 23.

Showcase: You eventuallylleft Israel
for New York at the invitation of Mar-

tha Graham. How did you make her .

acquaintance?
Naharin: She came to Israel to

choreograph a piece for the company '

I was working with and that’s how I met
her. Then she invited me to come to
New York to dance in her troupe. I was
very lucky.

Showcase: You left the Graham Com- '

pany to attend Juilliard. What did you
study there? ' .

Naharin: Mostly dance and dance
technique. I decided to take some time
_off from working with a company to be
a student. I wanted to enlarge and ex-
pand my training.

Showcaﬁsgé: An’t there a similarity of
roles there, that of choreographer to
dancer to the relationship of actor and
director? V

Naharin: There is a similarity, but a dif-
ference also. -The director is a creator,
like the choreographer makes
something out of nothing. He has the
music but sometimes not even that.
He’s both the writer and the director.
Showcase: You’ll be choreographing

composer Arvo Part’s “Tabula Rasa”
V here in Pittsburgh, in a world premiere

performance. The title can loosely be
translated from Latin to English to
mean “blank slate” or “clean sur-
face.” A press release I received
states that “the choreography at-
tempts to describe the feeling of

dance do. It may be an impression
someone got from viewing parts of the

work.

in this particular project with the PBT?

York to work on. In the creative pro-
cess, I might have spent a couple

that I would only throw out the next.
But I have to go through that process.

. That’s how things evolve for me.

Showcase: Also on the program with
“Tabula Rasa” is “Serenade,” a
dance set to Tchaikovsky's Serenade
in C Major for String Orchestra, and

Daniel Levin’s “Scene Dansante,” . '

another world premiere. Is there any
thematic unity or logical relationship of

‘these works to one another?

Naharin: No, I believe ' the artistic
director wants to have a balanced pro-
gram. I don’t know how the decision
to put these three pieces on the same
program was made, but when I come
here, I’m not trying to tie my work in
with anything else on the program. It’s
a separate entity by itself.

Showcase: What future performances"

do you have coming up after the PBT

run and what special projects would _

you like to do in the future?

Naharin: As to the future, I just want
to continue doing what I’m doing with
no special projects in mind. ‘As to
future commitments, I leave Pittsburgh
to fly back to New York to continue
rehearsal with my own company. After-
wards, I am scheduled for per-
formances in Israel, Chicago, Florida
and New York.

Showcase: Thank you, Mr. Naharin,
for your time. I hope you enjoy your
stay here in Pittsburgh. I know I'm
looking forward to seeing “Tabula

~ It was a stupifyingly eclectic night at
the local hotbed of alternative sounds.
Bbronk (you gotta say it hard to get
both bs in) opened the show and real-
ly left their stain, I mean mark, on my
mind and viscera. They play a uniquely
redundant heavy metal hybrid known
as Delta-acidmetal (“The acid’s in the
jams,” says vocalist Jamie Panzer)
with a strong Scandinavian influence
thrown in for spite. Judging from a
previous viewing and their hilarious
satire of a metal concert commercial
on WRCT, I had thought these guys
were strictly heavy metal parody, a

poor man's Spinal Tap. But waves of '

crunching volume and their decidedly
unembelllshed, linear set at the
Banana convinced me that these guys
are for real. They also confirmed
something l’ve known since I first
heard “Paranoid”: The odor of metal
is a sweat-soaked leather gauntlet dip-
ped in the vomit of a crippled mulatto
outside of CBGBs.

Next up was Ben Opie, who played
alto saxophone, solo. He squeaked,
stuttered and skronked with a narrative
sort of chaos and his beefy bebop
chops sent me sprawling on the tack-
filled carpet of industrial pipe dreams.
But his playing is best appreciated in-
tuitively, so the less said the better.

Then Eugene Chadbourne, the
Greensboro guitar/voice mastermind,
appeared on stage from nowhere. I
never saw such an unheraldic nonen-
trance before. But soon enough you
knew he was there because Chad-
bourne plays loud and weird and sings
in cartoon voices. He cites Merrie
Melodies, especially Bugs Bunny, as
having a large influence on his
aesthetic. ’

Chadbourne’s hour-plus set was one
continual aural collage of many things,

playing which included dozens of
tease fragments from his Sears-size

The Flirts: New Toy

‘ Well  they stole the title from a
Thomas Dolby song.  They stole the
musical hook from “Like a Virgin.” 
Yet for all their thieving they couldn’t
even come up with a mildly interesting
song. Sort of pathetic, isn’t it?

Paul Hardcastle: Just for Money

12-inch dance singles have become
such big business that, not surprising-

" ly, some of the more groundbreaking

and clever music recorded today can
be heard exclusively on the dance
floor. Here Paul (“19”) Hardcastle
takes a stab at more social commen-
tary. This week’s theme: “Crime does
not pay!” At least this time around the
“message” doesn’t get in the way of
the beat, and it’s all tongue-in-cheek
anyway. I don’t know how the hell
Hardcastle managed to get Lawrence
Olivier to narrate, but it’s quite a coup;
also featured are the voices of Bob
Hoskins, Ed O’Ross and Alan Talbot.
The actors read snippets of narra-
tion/dialogue here" and there
throughout what otherwise amounts to
a pretty average disco tune. ‘Still, the
overall sense of fun prevails, and it’s
neat to hear Olivier’s (digitally sam-

fortlessly move up, down and around
the guitar neck like a Maoist guerilla,

I almost knew without a doubt that this

guy could do anything he wanted with
and to his instrument.

And of course there were the voices,

suppose any unprincipled hack can
embellish his personal dungheap with
literary trappings.” Which, as it turned
out, was exactly the case.

Alice read laboriously at first, but she
soon warmed to her task. It seemed
that the heroine of The Annunciation,
Amanda, was fornicating every 10
pages or so, which was just enough to
keep A|ice’s knees aquiver and her
cheeks flushed. The vicissitudes of for-
tune, however, shifted about midway
into the novel, and Amanda, trapped
in a sterile, loveless marriage, was
made to endure an unhappy Spartan-
like celibacy, a fate Alice felt all too

. painfully, making her shudder in revul-

_sion.Alice, you see, had no stomach
for asceticism.

Ah, but happily, Amanda was soon
once again copulating with much
resolve and energy. Good ol’ plucky

Amanda; her resourcefulness
prevented her ever being long forlorn.
The details of plot, theme, character
and setting, Alice decided, were as
unimportant to her as they were to Ms.
Gilchrist who had used them as mere
vehicles with which to bound from one
instance of tawdry thrill‘-seeking to the
next. Alice read yet another steamy
sex scene and allowed herself the
pleasure of a gentle caress.

Alice finished the book and the bon-
bons simultaneously. She slowly licked
her fingers, by then sweet and sticky
and aromatic, savoring the last of a
delightful afternoon. She did not regret
having missed her soaps. Nor was she
sorry at having read The ‘Annunciation.
I, on the other hand, was livid. I
solemnly vow that I shall never again
judge a book by its cover. Ms. Gilchrist,
may God and the ghost of Leonardo
da Vinci forgive you! '

ranges, singing earnest and acerbic
political songs about U.S. blundering
in Central America, extreme right wing
neo-fascism and run-of-the-mill
government hyporcrisy. There were

also voices from Sesame Street, Jim I

Morrison (he absolutely demolished
the pretentious portentions of “Horse
Latitudes”), a stock Okie drawl and
the, ahem, covers. God, the covers.

They were more like straitjacket-
blankets of idiosyncrasy and revealed,
in all their irreverence and distortion,
a man who really loves his ’60s pop
music. He did a nerd version of
“Whiter shade of Pa|e,” which ex-
emplified his flair for nerd aesthetics,
made even more convincing by his
paunchy and bespeckled appearance.
He also did “Purple Haze” (the official
theme of the Geneva peace talks).
“Eight Miles High,” an updated ver-
sion of Country Joe’s “Fixin’ to Die
Rag,” Donovan’s “Universal Soldier”
and appropriately enough, Spike
Jones’ “Der Fuhrer’s Face.”

Not one to neglect the visually sen-
;atlona|, Chadbourne interrupted his
acoustic segment to play his patented
rake solos on a slightly modified 1966
Fender Mustang with rake tentacles at-
tached to its neckless body. ‘‘It makes
quite a din,” he once said of’ the
raketar and he din make dat up. Us-
ing a hammer, the floor and a gunsaw
(he actually sawed into the wood) on
the creature, Chadbourne gave new
meaning tothe Townshend school of
creatively destructive instrumentation.
The high point of this sensory attack
came when he put a birdcage over his
head, played (?) the rake against it and
sang a fragment from the Carpenter’s
“Sing a Song.” ‘ -

Hannah uses a very modern, direct
but natural writing style throughout,
with a stark, rea|istic’feel and a strong
underlying sense of absurdity. While
these traits might put him well within
the Southern tradition (he’s from
Mississippi), the surprisingly vast
storehouse of subject matter, charac-

- ters and time periods that the author

draws from keeps his hands well out
of the dreaded cliche jar.

While reading Airships, you will en-
counter, among other things, the Civil
and Vietnam wars, musicians, tennis
players, geriatrics, kids, a spaceship,
a motorboat, the deep South, the
future and the Tri-Borough Toll Bridge.

One problem with Airships which oc-
curs most often in the first half of the
collection and occasionally throughout,
is Hannah's desire to take characters
to the extreme of personalities. This
need not necessarily be a problem in
itself but for Hannah it creates yet a
larger problem: as Hannah demon-
strates, it is often difficult to end a story
about an extreme character without
suddenly killing him or letting him,
unclimactically, fade away. Many of
the best stories in the collection have
this problem. The overachieving,
almost mythological, Quadberry in
“Testimony of a Pilot” and the warped,
lustful Mother Rooney in “Mother-
Rooney Unscrolls the Hurt” are two of

The slowly rocking title cut is a dis-
quieting, if puzzling, look at a “rock ‘n’

roll ballerina.” Stevie Nicks’ real gem,

however, is a ballad she wrote entitled,

‘‘I Sing For The Things.” You say I
have everything/We/l, I ’m living on

dreams and chains/But, I sing for the

thing money can’t buy, she emotes,
establishing her love through the crux
of life’s simple pleasures: /’/l take off
my cape for you//’// take down my hair
for you/Anything you want me to do,

my love. And though it's too brief, the
album’s closing out, “Has Anyone
Ever Written Anything For You,” pro-
vides a few poignant moments.

If Rock A Little is dedicated to the
great singers, as Stevie Nicks ex-
presses in the album’s credits, then
she had better include herself in the
tapestry. Clean production work by
Rick Nowels and Jimmy Lovine, along
with background work from singers like.
Maria Vidal and Marilyn Martin, com-
plement the overall sound of this
album. On Stevie Nicks’ Ouija board,
there are no rules, no boundries. Her
imagination runs wild and her music-is
a magical departure into a poetic
world, one which most singers fear to
travel. She offers us a metaphor we
can’t refuse: Just like the sea/I rock a
little. - '

Turner, great legs, but c’mon, a grand-
mother in leather? Mr. B's ninth choice
is pretty funny, too. Apollonia was on
everybody’s “good” list until she
started wearing clothes.

‘ I guess Mr. BIackwell_had a good
time compiling this list. To show that
he's not too bad of a guy, he made a
Best Dressed list also. This was fairly
predictable though. It included Nancy
Reagan, Princess Di and Mary Tyler
Moore.

Then, when you think this Blackwell
guy is finished, he hits you with one
more list. It is his ‘‘Hall of Fame” of the
all-time worst dressed women. This list
includes Elizabeth Taylor, Barbara
Streisand, Charlene Tilton and Cher.
Well done.

While" writing this article, I noticed
that the women in Mr. B|ackwel|’s list
are all either in the movies or on TV.

I then began to think of women whose A

dress could have been a little better in
their movie or TV careers. Well, after

considerable deliberation, l’ve come
up with my own list of the all-time worst
dressed women of TV or film.

I mean, if a guy named Blackwell
from Los Angeles can have a list, why
can’t I? Besides, who’s better to judge
the appearance of a woman than a
man. So, without further comment
here it is, G.B.’s All-Time Worst
Dressed Women of TV or Film:

June Cleaver
Shirley Partridge
Carol Brady

Lily Munster
Wilma Flintstone

Ellie Mae Clampett
YO! Adrian

I hope I haven’t offended any. of
these ladies or their fans. These lists
are all in fun. If youhave an idea for
a future list or any idea for the style col-
umn in general, please write. It’s good
to be back.

The Pitt News, January 31, 1986,

Pitt hosts Seton Hll omorow

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

The Pitt basketball team has now
reached the half way point of the 1986
Big East season. As the Panthers begin
the second half of conference play, they
find themselves in fifth place with a 4-4
mark. Overall, the Panthers lay claim
to a respectable 13-6 record.

Pitt will turn the corner in conference
play tomorrow, as they host the
league’s last-place team, Seton Hall.
The Pirates are a disappointing 10-10
for the year ‘and are struggling to sur-
vive another Big East season at 0-6.

Despite not having won a conference

game, Seton Hall does have some

players. Andre McCloud is fifth in
league scoring with a 16.7 ppg
average. The Pirates also have the
league’s third best assist man in Gerald
Greene, who is dishing out an average
of 6.3 assists per game.

Pitt will enter tomorrow‘s 8 p.m. tip-
off at home looking to rebound from
last Saturday’s frustrating 68-67 loss to
St. John’s. For the second time this
season Pitt lost a heartbreaker to the
seventh-ranked Redmen. Pitt has now
had one week to prepare for Seton
Hall, a team they earlier defeated 81-66
on the road at the Brendan Byrne
Arena.

“This team will be a little different
this time, [from] when we saw them the
first time," said head coach Roy Chip-
man. “They‘ll now have one of their
better players back in [Mark] Bryant.
He’s one of their top scorers.”

Going into tomorrow’s contest, Pitt
-has been virtually unstoppable at home.
The Panthers are 8-1 at the field house
this season and have won 12 of their
last 13 dating back to last year.

Leading the Panthers against Seton
Hall will be junior Curtis Aiken who
scored 22 points on nine of 15 shots in
the first meeting between the Panthers
and the Pirates. Aiken was named
MVP by Coca-Cola and $250 was
given to the general scholarship fund

_ in his name.

Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers’ problems con-
tinued Wednesday night as they were
beaten by the Georgetown Hoyas,
77-69 in a Big East conference game
in Washington, D.C.

“Georgetown played well,” said
head coach Kirk Bruce. “They were
really ready for us. Offensively, we
struggled. We couldn’t get into our of-
fense."

The loss dropped Pitt to 7-10 overall
and 3-7 in the conference.
Georgetown, avenging an earlier-
season loss to the Lady Panthers, im-
proved their record to 6- 14 overall and
2-8 in the Big East.

‘ ‘I ‘think I can have another effort like

that again,” said Aiken. “I still feel ‘

confident, but they’ll probably come
out to try and stop me. We need to just
keep moving the ball to find the open
guy.” -

Seton Hall would be making a
mistake trying to stop any one in-
dividual. Pitt is ranked among the best
teams in the nation for shooting with
a percentage of 53.3 per game.

“We’re one of the 15 best shooting
teams in the country,” said assistant
coach Reggie Warford. “The only way
you do that is with balance. We have
to continue having good balance.”

The Panthers certainly have balance
as five players post ppg averages in
double figures. In addition to Aiken
(14.9 points per game), other support-
ing cast members include Demetreus
Gore (15.7), Darryl Shepherd (10.4)
and Jerome Lane (10.3). Leading the
way is none other than Charles Smith
who is currently maintaining a 17 ppg
average.

‘‘I’m beginning to get into the groove
a little better,” said Smith. “For me,
the only thing I need to do is keep bet-
ter track of my fouls, because that’s
hurt me and the team.”

Pitt will begin their stretch run to the
Big East tournament somewhat
bewildered, having closely lost several
key games. “In the second half,” said
Chipman, “we’ll hopefully win some
of the close games we’ve lost.”

“We’re not going to do anything dif-
ferent in the second half,” said Smith.
"We did have some breakdowns on of-
fense and defense at times that we must
correct, but we’ll be the same type of
team. We were 10 points from first
place in the Big East.”

As for changes, don’t expect
anything different from the‘Panthers.
“I think we’ve been successful with
what we’ve been doing so far,” said
Aiken. “The first half of play is over,
and that’s behindus. We need to real-
ly attack teams now and continue to be
aggressive, especially on defense.”

The loss was an intriguing one, ac-
cording to Bruce: “I don’t know what
happened to us. I don’t know if it was
a continuation of the Providence loss
or the fact that our game with Du-
quesne was cancelled. But we just
didn’t play that well."

Four Lady Panthers scored in dou-
ble figures against the Hoyas. Kim
Gannis scored 17 points, while Jenny
Tyner, Kim Tirik and Sally Sheerer
each had 13. Sheerer tied her career
high with 13 rebounds.

Georgetown was led by sophomore
forward/center Beth Knight. Knight, a
member of last year’s Big East All-
Freshman team, scored 29 points and
had 10 rebounds.

For Pitt. the loss was especially

disappointing, considering their

second-half comeback.

Press Box  

“We were down 11 points and we
came back to take the lead by two in
the middle of the second half,” said
Bruce. “It was a tremendous come-
back, but it took a lot out of us.”

Pitt has now lost six of their last
seven games and they need a quick
reversal before their season expecta-
tions slip out of their grasp. Saturday
night, the Lady Panthers have a chance
to start that reversal as they host the
Seton Hall Bucettes at 5:30 p.m. at Fit-
zgerald Field House in a preliminary
to the men’s game.

Seton Hall, 4-15 overall and 1-8 in
the league going into a Wednesday
night away game against Providence,
is led by freshman forward Geraldine
Saintilus.

Saintilus was last week’s Big East
Freshman of the Week for "her record-
breaking performance against. St.
Johns. In that contest, Saintilus scored
31 points, breaking the Big East
Freshman record for points in a single

A game. She is currently sixth in the

league in scoring at 16.7 points per
game and she also ranks in‘the top 10
in field goal and free throw percentage.

The game is very important for Pitt
and Bruce displayed confidence: “We
beat them in overtime earlier in the
year and in that game, ‘we controlled
the tempo. We have to do the same
thing Saturday night. Our girls will be
ready to play. We really need to win
this game." '

As I see it

The Pitt News. January 31. 1986

By Jim Brueckner

Perhaps sports stars do not

I had planned on this column contain-
ing a random collection of comments
on the Super Bowl and the past NFL
season. However, something happened
Monday night that caused me to change
my mind.

This was not a new thought that had
entered, but one that never really sunk
in whenever I had considered it

_ previously.

I was watching the American Music
Awards, especially looking forward to
the presentation of a special award to
my favorite singer, Paul McCartney.
But at the end of the evening, there
were three acceptance speeches that
stuck out in my mind, not just
McCartney’s. 0

Bob Geldof and Harry Belafonte
were both given special awards for
their famine relief efforts. Belafonte
gave an especially moving account of

~ past performers who have donated their ‘

time and talents to helping the less for-

- tunate. Geldof’s speech was more to

the point. After lulling the audience by
joking around, he went straight for the
heart. He said something to the effect
of: “I'm a little ambivalent about ac-

cepting this award, because a lot of
people had to die for me to get this
award.” The crowd was silent.

It caused me to consider this point.
Are we overplaying the exploits of pro-
fessional athletes and downplaying the
true heroics of men like Geldof?

Let’s clear the air. There have been
athletes who have been true heroes in
every sense of the word. They have
been men like Jack Johnson. Joe Louis,
Jackie Robinson, Pete Gray, Roberto
Clemente and all of the athletes that
have donated thousands of hours to
Special Olympics. They were heroes.

But let’s face it, a .300 batting
average or 1,000 yards‘ rushing does

not in any way, shape or form equal 0

the efforts of Bob Geldof or a Mother
Teresa. Yet, there are many people
who look at things just that way.

I was impressed when~a recent poll
showed that Mother Teresa was second
on a list of who today’s public con-
siders the top heroes. Although he is
a great guy and a lot of fun, does Bill
Cosby really belong at No. 1.? That’s
where‘ he finished. .

Monday night saw Geldof rewarded

for his heroic work. Not to take
anything away from Belafonte or Willie
Nelson (who was honored for his work
with Farm Aid) — Geldof was the mo":
significant.

Unfortunately, there are many peo-
ple who know more about William
“The Refrigerator" Perry than they do
about Geldof. People just aren’t aware
of the lengths that Geldof went to in his
quest to alleviate world hunger. He
gave up his musical career for such a
long time (just as his group, The Boom-
town Rats, was beginning to get
popular) that he may have cost himself
proﬁts running into 'a few million
dollars.

I don’t mean to say that athletes are
selfish and uncaring about helping out
charities. Quite the contrary, many
spend a lot of time helping out others.
But too often, if some athlete is giving
a number of hours of his time to chari-
ty, that amount of time is exaggerated
by the media, and the public is misled.

Tell me something. Why would.

anyone need $1 million per year? I
realize that many of these athletes have
nothing to fall back on and would like

$35.

to make enough money in their careers
to support them for the rest of their
lives, but consider this: a large family
could live very comfortably off the in-
terest of a $2 million bank account.
These athletes could part with a large
portion of their paychecks and never
even feel it,and I’m sure many do con-
tribute, but why don’t all ofthem? Yet
they‘ are held up as heroes without
peers. ‘

This is not meant to downplay their
achievements on the field of play. It is
true that these men and women are per-
forming at a level that the fans could
never duplicate. There are even occa-
sions when an athletic achievement
could be rightfully deemed “incredi-
ble” or “spectacular” or “breathtak-
ing. ” These athletes are heroes, but in
their own sense of that oft-abused
word. People throw the word “hero”
around and rate all heroes equally.
Such is not the case. ‘

It’s like the difference between a
soldier being awarded the Bronze Star
and another soldier being awarded the
Congressional Medal of Honor. They
are both heroic achievements, but not

' of the same stature.

This worshipping of athletes has led
to a major problem in our society.
Think about it.

A person like Geldof or Mother
Teresa dedicates his whole life to ma-
jor projects and we know they are in-
volved in these projects almost every
minute of the day. This is his life.

But what about athletes? We see
them only on the field of play. Danger
lurks when young children start to wor-
ship these athletes as gods or something
similar.

I honestly feel that the drug problem
in sports is with a minority of the
athletes. But there is an obvious prob-
lem when one athlete of this minority
becomes the object ‘of worship of a
young athlete. This young athlete tries
to resemble his or her hero both on and

only the finest

Forbes at Halket Streets

shine as brightly as others do

off the field. The result can be a
disaster.

This is where the parents must step
in and tell their children that an athlete
is to be admired for athletic prowess
alone. If they want to completely
emulate a person then the parent should
instruct them as to what makes up a
true hero. A good fastball does not
make someone a model citizen. He
could easily be a drug addict or a rap-
ist. Worshipping athletes as gods is on-
ly "asking for trouble. It's not only
wrong and unfair to the real heroes of
the world, but it is a hazard to the
values of the young children (and future
leaders) of our society.

As I said, this is not meant to
downplay the achievements of these
athletes. They are heroes in their own
right. There is nothing wrong with
young athletes “worshipping" them
for their skills.

I only ask that their athletic
achievements be put into proper
perspective.

 Pitt News, ‘January 31, 19S6
Former walk-on

By Paul Fischer
For The Pitt News

Should Sylvester Stallone ever
decide to spin off his Rocky saga into
basketball, he would have an easy job
writing the script if he follows the
career of University of Pittsburgh star
guard Kim Gannis.

Gannis, a 5-8 senior from Brent-
wood, has quietly been leading the
relatively inexperienced Lady Panthers
to Big East respectability. Unassuming
and modest, Gannis has let her per-
formance do most of the talking this
year. Currently, she ranks third in the
Big East with an average of 19 points
per game and is tied for fifth with a
57.1 field goal percentage.

To those who remember Gannis at
Brentwood, where she was named
P0st—Gazette and Section AA Player of
the Year on her way to becoming the
Lady Spartans’ all—time leading scorer,
the aforementioned statistics are no sur-
prise. Yet it has been a long time since
the spotlights have been turned on,
three years in fact, as she has advanced
from a freshman walk—on to top reserve
and now co—captain and leading scorer.
scorer.

“It didn't bother me because when
you get to this leveleverybody is as
good as I was in high school,” said

Gannis. “I even enjoyed coming in as
the sixth man because everyone is look-
ing to you to pick it up and get it
done.”

Gannis played basketball during the
off—season in a summer league. She
also employs a conditioning weapon
used by the Balboa camp to help defeat
Mr. T — the pool. Gannis has five
years’ experience as a lifeguard and
considers swimming her No. 1 hobby.
The overall conditioning swimming
delivers is a major factor in Gannis
upholding her trademark of hustle all
game long.

Every champion has a trainer/man-
ager behind their success, and Gannis

is no different. Not surprisingly,
veteran Brentwood Lady Spartans
coach Dave Warner is enjoying this
season’s performance by Gannis as
much as anybody.

“I’m overjoyed she’s doing as well
as she is,” Warner said. “Her situa-
tion was very frustrating her senior
year here. We contacted some 20
schools and none of them was in-
terested. She decided on Pitt and made
the team as a walk—on. She still didn’t
get an opportunity to fully show what
she’s capable of, and she has really
earned her way herself. Being the kind
of person Kim is, she deserves every
bit of the success she’s having.”

 

Warner is partially responsible for
teaching Gannis more than basketball
fundamentals. The two have remained
close friends. “When I wasn’t playing
a lot I always was able to go back and
talk to him,” Gannis said. “IfI had
gone away to play, I wouldn’t have
been able to do that.”

Lady Panthers head coach Kirk
Bruce is glad Gannis decided to stay
close to home as are her parents who
attend all Pitt games at Fitzgerald Field
House. Yet coming into the season,
Bruce inherited a question mark at the
shooting guard position. And Gannis
has exceeded all expectations. “Kim
has played as if she has something to
prove,” Bruce said. “She deserved the
right to play and, obviously, she’s done
that and more.”

Bruce’s coaching philosophy has also
made Gannis and her teammates bet-
ter players. “I’m enjoying basketball
more this year because the pressure is
off,” Gannis said. “We want to win
but we’re also allowed to have fun out
there, too.”

The Lady Panthers may also have to
thank Gannis as well as Coach Bruce
‘for that. With Gannis performing so
well, Bruce and his staff have a lot
less to worry about.

Time to get back   in shape

_ I started running again yesterday.
Well, it was sort of running, anyway.
It was faster than a walk but much
slower than an actual all-out sprint.

I sort of go through phases when it
comes to physical ﬁtness. I start out
with a nearly religious fervor to go all
out all the time. I tell myself that I'm

' goingto get into better shape than Carl

Lewis, or at least Jane Fonda. That
usually lasts about a month.

By then, I start getting lazy again,
telling myself I’m in great shape
already and could afford to miss a few
days of training. It doesn‘t take a genius
to ﬁgure out that what happens next is
that I discover it is much easier to get
out of shape than it is to get into shape.
So, I stop all physical activity. Most
of it anyway. I still eat.

A few months later, I’ll see that old
waistline begin to bulge over the belt
and I decide that I must get back into
shape immediately. As you can see, a
viscious cycle is developing.

But I'm no worse than the physical
ﬁtness nuts who live for the next
aerobics class or lunch hour at the gym.
It’s been said that ﬁtness has become
the major addiction of the health-
conscious '80s, supplanting the
alcoholic ’50s and hallucinogenic ’60s
and '70s. '

Actually, I think the ﬁtness boom is
a plot started by aerobics instuctors
who have designs on taking over the
world. They’d make Jane Fonda queen
and Tom Hayden. her husband and
California legislator, would be presi-

- dent or king or something. At least Jane
has experience — she was pretty
powerful in “Barbarella.“ I wish Jane
would leave us all alone.

After losing their ﬁrst regular season
game last Tuesday to Duquesne 7-5,
the Pitt Hockey Club upped their
record last Saturday by defeating
Carnegie-Mellon 4-2.

CMU took an early lead and had a
1-0 advantage over the Panthers at the

I 4 end of the ﬁrst period. Pitt came back

to tie the game in the second when right
wing Roger Oldaker scored what
turned out to be the only goal of the
period. CMU again took the lead ear-
ly in the third, but Panther left wing
Jim Hendrickson quickly evened the
score. It wasn’t until late in the period
that defenseman Gregg Schmidtetter
put in Pitt’s game-winning goal with
four minutes remaining on the clock.
Goalie Jeff Rohay held the Tartans to
one goal in the third period which
enabled the Panthers to secure a come-
from-behind win.

“It was a close game in the begin-
ning, even though it shouldn’t have
been,” commented Hendrickson, who
said he felt that Pitt could have easily
won by a bigger margin. “Rohay had
a good game. They [CMU] were real-
ly pounding on him at ﬁrst. He deﬁnite-

catch us and probably toss us into the
ocean. That‘s the real reason I’m get-
ting in shape —- to avoid the Invasion
of the Aerobics People.

Sure, you all laugh now. but in this
space last December it was predicted
that Brooke Shields and William Perry
of the Bears would become romantical-
ly involved and people scoffed. But
guess what couple showed up on a
Christmas special together?‘

That’s right, those crazy kids Billy
and Brooke.

But I digress. Then again, this en-

couldn‘t have digressed from a digres-
sion. could I? Ask your philosophy
professor. He’ll know.

Anyway. back to the fun of physical

it was real cold out there yesterday._But
I ran anyway. It’s really wierd when
you run at a speed that is above the

ly kept us in the game. If he wouldn’t
have played so strong we never would
have been able to come back and win
it in the end."

Finally, a goal scored by center Jeff
Bele on CMU’s empty net in the last
eight seconds of play ensured the Pan-
ther win in a. game which minutes
earlier could have easily gone in favor
of the Tartans. _Pitt is now 6-1-1 in
regular season play.

With the playoffs a little more than
a month away the Panthers are look-
ing ahead with some apprehension. The
three teams which Pitt will most likely
face in the playoffs — Gannon, CMU
and Duquesne — are the ones that have
given them the most trouble this
season. Last month’s meeting with
Gannon ended in a controversial tie and
wasa game which much of the team
would prefer to forget. Duquesne
handed the Panthers their only regular
season loss last Tuesday 7-5, after Pitt
had beaten them the month before by
the same score. Finally, as indicated by
the outcome of Saturday’s game with
CMU, the Tartans will at the very least
give the Panthers a run for their money.
But, like many teams, the Pitt/Hockey
Club remains optimistic about taking
the championship this year.
“Our schedule got kind of easy this
year for a while, and there were guys

 

temperature. You get cold, but not in
your face and hands. but in weird
places. Shoulders. for example. Does
anybody know what I mean‘? Why do
shoulders get cold when you run in the
middle of winter. but not hands‘?
Other strange things happen. You
don’t sweat as much as you do in July.
but still enough so that you have to
shower afterwards. You know what
else about running I hate? When you
live in a teensy, tiny dorm room like
I do. there- is nowhere to hide your

sweaty clothes. At home you can throw ‘

them downstairs and let them die. but
in a dorm room there is no such place.
Then the» clothes smell and then the
whole room smells. Dorm rooms are
badenough without having them smell
like locker rooms.

I thought about running inside, but
I was always afraid I’d go to the field
-house right in the middle of a basket-
ball game and the crowd would boo my
intermediate times around the track —
and I‘d hate to ever get booed by the
fans at Fitzgereald Field House.

So I’ll go on running, freezing my
shoulders off and sweating until spring.
when I suppose I’ll stop running and
enjoy life again.

 

Hockey team bounces back  

who weren’t giving it their all," said
Hendrickson.
play more as a team. We know we have

the potential to go out and kill everyone

in the playoffs. If we’re going to take
the championship, this is the year to do
it.”

Pitt runners head
south to Florida

By Roy Bigler
Staff Writer

On Sunday, Feb. 2, the Pitt men’s
track team will be travelling to
Gainsville, Fla. to take part in a meet
between six different teams at the
University of Florida. Attending the
meet will be: Florida State, Auburn,
Northwestern. Penn State. the Univer-
sity of Florida and Pitt.

The men have never run at the
University of Florida, and are hoping
for some good things to-happen. Head

form a juggling act with some of the
athletes on his team in an attempt to ac-
complish several things. “I am go-
ing to move some people around to
check out theteam‘, and see what they
are capable of," said Vasvary. “The
team will not be as strong, but it will
give us a chance to work on some
things.”

The track at the University of Florida
is exceptionally fast and there will be
a good bit of competition present for
the people who do run. This will open
up the opponunity for some athletes to
qualify for the Big East. and perhaps
the IC4As. Some ofthose who will be
hoping to qualify will be the hurdlers.
“This will be the first chance for com-
petition for the hurdlers because
previously they had been running
against each other,” stated Vasvary.
“They could certainly qualify for the
Nationals."

Overall, the team is still decidedly
weak in the field events, but in spite
of that, Vasvary is hoping that they will
do well. Therefore, as ateam they may
not be the most awesome thing that will
set foot on the track this weekend, but
they will certainly be formidable. “The
field events are weak, but we will
definitely have some good perform-
ances this weekend,” summarized
Vasvary.
