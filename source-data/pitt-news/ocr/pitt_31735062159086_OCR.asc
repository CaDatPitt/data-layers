Wherein Is Floated
The Question
Of A Big Navy

BY ROBERT SAFFRON

‘We had better get worried
about those bogie-men the na-
tional administration sees
everywhere,‘ as i.t clubs the
boys into voting for its rahrah
navy—or we shall soon be

called upon to defend San
Francisco’s Golden Gate on they
eroded plains of China.

The American public is asked to
pitch in $800,000,000 for a pro-
gram of naval expansion, to make
sure that we will have a ﬂeet large
enough to polish off any opponents
on both coasts at the same time.
This means a ﬂeet big enough to
bombard J apan’s out of the Paciﬁc
ocean, and another to chase Italy,
Germany, and assorted problem-
atical aggressors out of the Atlan-
tic.

Aggressive Or Defensive

I don’t mind the President’s
buying a few ships to play around
with—if these Big Navy men must
have their ﬂing——but boats cost
about $75,000,000 a throw. Be-
sides, I gather from my conversa-
tions with ROTC men on the sub-
ject that thorough defense of a
practically complete territorial and
economic unit like the United
States involves more the use of
coast batteries backed by aircraft,
mines, etc., than ships. Of course,
you might say the bestdefense is
an oﬁense—that we must be pre-
pared to steam out and knock off
somebody or other before he gets
to our coast.

That point worries me, especial-
ly when I read an interview with
Admiral Claude Bloch, com-
mander-in-chief of the American
ﬂeet, in which the writer (Paul
Gallico, the eminent authority on
horseﬂesh and strikeouts) related
that Admiral Bloch becomes con-
fused when he hears talk about de-
fensive and aggressive Wars. He
confesses:

“I’m afraid I get all muddled
when they talk about this aggres-
sive and defensive warfare. There’s
only one kind of war I know, and
that’s war. Did you ever hear of
any other kind?”

I become more perplexed bythe,

questions raised by Paul Y. An-
derson, Washington correspondent
in The Nation: “Why was it ‘vital
to the interests and defense of the
country’ that Admiral Leahy re-
fused to disclose the nature of the
London conference between Cap-
tain Royal Ingersoll, chief of the
War Plans Division, and the Brit-
ish "Admiralty? Why did Anthony
Eden decline to tell the House of
Commons about the concert of ac-
tion by the United States and
Britain in the Orient?”

‘Preserve The Empire’

The English are, of course, good
clean people. We liked the Eng-
lish in the last war and we still
like them—so much that we are
willing to cooperate, pull their
chestnuts from the Eastern fry-
ing pan. Anderson reports that
Congressmen received, as informa-
tion justifying the naval boom, a
set of documents including the
Inskip report, “made by a sub-
committee of the British Imperial
Defense Committee in 1936.” This
committee found that battleships
are easily crippled by airplanes,
but that they are necessary for pro-
tecting trade routes “to preserve
the empire.” And, says Anderson,
“one Big Navy member of the
House Committee on Naval Affairs
reinforced his argument with a
passage lifted verbatim from the
Inskip report, except that he sub-
stituted ‘the country’ for the ‘em-
pire.”’

This appears to be part of the
President’s naive, war mongering
collective security policy of quar-
antining the aggressor nations.
England will keep the peace in the
Atlantic and we will do our bit in

SFA Ends

Propaganda Club

(See editorial, page 2)

Proponents of the American
Student Union on campus
reached the end of their trail
Friday afternoon when SFA’s
executive committee, “after
due consideration,” refused
recognition to ASU.

According to E. Ernest Rose,
D38, president of SFA, the com-
mittee decided that the ASU fell‘
into the class of “purely propa-
ganda” associations, and was
therefore rejected. “In addition,”
added executive committeeman Al
Barr, BA38, “the ASU did not
have a fair representation of stu-

dents, and could not present a
cross-section of campus opinion.”

Executive committeeman Wil-
liam Stark, C38, the only dissent-
ing voice in the ﬁnal vote, made
public the statement that he was
entirely out of sympathy with this
“suppressive action” of the SFA
executive committee.

Robert Saffron, C38, president
of the Pitt Student Union, ASU
chapter seeking a charter, was in-
dignant over the com1nittee’s ac-
tion. “Democracy is predicated,”
he said, “upon the axiom that all
groups right, left, or center, have
their chance to make themselves
heard. This
example of un—American sup-
pression of freedom of speech.”

Rose, when questioned concern-
ing the anti-ASU» action, had noth-
ing to say, except: “My opinion on
the mattervdoesn’t matter a bit of
difference, anyway.”

Art Giles Recalls Hectic Days
Spent In First University Band

By GEORGE HYDE
Back in the days of ’15 the University Band wasn’t the, re-
nowned organization that it is today, according to Arthur Wil-
liam Giles, BA15, who was one of the ﬁrst to play in the or-

ganization.

Mr. Giles, who is better known in dance circles as “Art

Giles,” returns to the campus
Monday, February 28, to provide
the music for the alumni dancers
at the Charter Day ball.

In recalling the days of the
band’s infancy, Giles revealed
several amusing incidents in con-
nection with its early organiza-
tion.

During his undergraduate days,
Giles, who played the trumpet, and

, several fellow "students decided

that a school of the University of
Pittsburgh’s size needed a band to
play at football games.

“We received permission to or-
ganize students who played band
instruments for the purpose of
playing at the games,” Gilessaid,
“and our mothers sewed .large
‘P’s’ on our sweaters—no two of
which were alike.

“It seems that many boys in the
neighborhood learned that the
members of the band were getting
into the games free. So when we
assembled at Thaw hall to march

to Forbes ﬁeld, where the games
were held in those days, large
numbers of these boys joined us.
They carried all kinds of musical
instruments, and wore all kinds of
sweaters.

“As soon as we were in Forbes
ﬁeld, they immediately ipiled’ their
instruments at home plate and
made a wild dash for seats in dif-
ferent section of the stands. And
where there had been 60 or 70 in
the band when we entered, there
were only about ten left who act-
ually played band 'music.”

Giles also recalled that there
was no love lost between the foot-
ball team and the band in those
days. The team thought that they
should be the only students priv-
ileged to wear the varsity letter,
and considered the band sissies!
On one occasion, they even threat-
ened to chase the band off the
ﬁeld. The band retaliated by
playing extra loud when the team
called signals in front of them.

Why Not Throw The
University Off Campus’?
HIS procedure would be admittedly
difficult, but in the interests of jus-
tice, fairness, and consistency‘, it must
be done. , .»

The cxcciitive committee of SFA has
<‘.isv.«.-«.~vc-i'e<l that it has always been its
}‘)<’>l’i<f_\‘ to infuse recognition to “purely
propagaii.da” groups and therefore
tinned down the local American St1i-
‘dent-Unioi1’s request to meet on cam-
pus. Another factor in the decision was
that the ASU did not have a fair rep??-
seiitation of students and could not pre-
sent a cross—section of campus opinion.

That is SFA’S policy and it’s stuck
with it. Forgetting for the ‘nioment the
utter iiianity of such an pretext, we are
going to insist that the executive com-
mittee follow through with it and toss
off campus:

(1) The Pitt Peace Council, a purely
propagandist organization.

(2) The Pitkin and Newman Clubs,
which, being composed of students of
certain" religious denominations, cer-
tainly do not represent a fair cross-sec-
tion of campus opinion.

(3) The men’s social fraternities,
Delta Tau Delta, Kappa Sigma, Lamb-
da Chi Alpha, Omega Psi Phi, Phl
Delta Theta, Phi Epsilon P1, Phi Gram-
ma. Delta, Phi Kappa, Kappa Alpha,
Pi Lambda Phi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Sigma Alpha Mu, Sigma Chi, ‘and Theta
Chi. These do not represent a cross-
section of the campus but only those

who can afford to pay the monthly dues ,

and satisfy membership qualiﬁcations.

(4) The 15 women’s social fraterni-
ties, for the same reason. _
. , (5) The 25 honorary men’s fraterni-
ties. These consist of only the more in-
telligent and active students and are
therefore not aifair cross-section.

(6) The entire ROTC departmnet,
which uses regular army officers to

propagandize for its own kind of “p1°e- ~

paredness.” .

(7) Every social science department
inthe school, since the subjects taught
therein are -colored by interpretation
(pr0pais'anda>,-  - .  

(8) The scientiﬁc and mathematical
departments, which give you only their
one-sided viewpoint‘ (since there often
is no other side). _ i. I

(9) The rest of the university, since
“education” is practically the same as
“propaganda” which means solely the
spiébading of information ‘

In short, we are of opinion that action must

ent‘ Tuck Shop be expanded to provide a better
sandwich service and to serve a few hot dishes

But the real question, as Gov-
ernor Aiken recognized even if he
didn’t ‘deny the Founding. Fathers
in so many words, is vital nation-
al leadership in this troublesome
age of ours. Speaking ofthis he
say, “We cannot tolerate Repub-
lican"(and— he might have added
Democratic) lip-service to states’
rights ‘simply to cover up the
abuses which backwardstates or
backward Big Business refuse to
exterminate.” '
While his speech was a kind of
pep-talk to Republicans gathered
to listen to the siren voice of
Arthur (I wanna be president in
1940) Vandenberg lay waste the
New Deal’s alleged collectivism
—and I can’t decide quite what
he means by the term—Governor
Aiken’s thesis, extended to logical
completeness, might be examined
by many statesmen today. For
one thing his speech is a master-
ful crusade against partisan criti-
cism in government. " ‘

He Might Have Said . . .

' ’The’Good‘ Governor, for all his
sanity in a bewildered political
scene, did not ‘say all‘ that he
might have said, or possibly even
all that he thought. He might
have indicated that a stranger
and" more. -consistent economic
policy is needed; he might have
ilimned the-beginnings of a realis-
tic foreign policy; he might have
elaborated signiﬁcantly, I think,
on the role of a governor in an in-
terdependent national unit—as an
auxiliary administrator. of nation-
al programs and policies instead
of an obdurate defender of local
economic prejudice.

Nevertheless he did say some-

of good to read his remarks. ' Yet
they, in their provincial obtuse-
ness, have come to the ‘point
where they believe it’s impossible
for a Republican to say anything

to admit. And this is ‘indeed in

worth while.

Coaches Should Act
K On Olympiad

By LEONARD LEVISON —»

Notwithstanding the fact that
the campus opposition to Pitt
Peace Council’s anti—Japanese
boycott has had little effective-
ly articulateresponse from stu-
dent quarters, there is much to
be ' said against applying such
economic sanctions. But, there is
one aspect of forming the picket
li ne around
Japan that has
been complete-
ly overlooked
by the parties
concerned i n
the U n i t e d
States. A n d ,
about it, there
is no case for
the negative.

Not one foot
M has been stomp-
 . ed against
American participation in the 1940
Olympic Games. to. be. held in
Tokio, whose favorite sport- these
days is to help somebody else com-
mit hari—kari.-

Situation Reviewed

At least, if there has been any
American negation to going
through with the Tokio Olympiad,
it has gained less expression than
the Pitt cagers did for their ﬁeld
goal complex against Notre Dame.
This has been the American sit-
uation, despite the facts that the
present time is the most auspici-
ous to concentrate action, and that
cables from the British Empire and
from France indicate that the path
these democratic strongholds are
pursuing will not lead to the land
of the rising sun. -.

The immediate movement is
propitious, because this is the eve
of the biennial" meeting of the In-
tenational Olympic Committee at
Cairo, Egypt. Perhaps, an ex-
planation of the Olympic situation
and its possibilities to date is now
in order. ‘ ” "

The situation is just this. After
considerable wrangling, it was
finally voted upon to award the
games to Tokio. There were three
candidates in the running, Tokio,
Helsingfors, and London. John
Bull withdrew early in the pri-
mary and let the Nipponese ﬁght
it out with Paavo Nurmi’s coun-
trymen.

Japan had the more successful
caucus, and won. But, only after
a very close ballot. The nature of
the voting was that the bulk of
European countries favored Fin.-
land, but that the South American
countries, wanting a more closer
stamping ground, swung the elec-
tion.

Reports In Order

There is nothing special about
the Cairo meeting scheduled in a
few weeks. It is the regular meet-
ing, held midway between each
Olympiad, to go over general mat-
ters. However, there are two com-
pulsory features. First, is the
“progress report,” in which the
host city must present evidence to
the fact that it is moving at the
correct pace. It is necessary for
Tokio to prove that preparations
for 1940 are honky-dory.

In the second place, there is a
technical report to be made by
Herr Werner Klingeberg, who was
Technical Director of ’36 Berlin
games and who has been. designat-
ed by the committeei-to keep his
eyes on T_okio"and to report.

In the event that both reports
are satisfactory, and being that
there seems to be some sort of
mutuality between Tokio and
Berlin they will..probably be co-
ordinated, the committee i will
likely go on to other inconse-
quential details, and.,adjourn.

There are, nonetheless, two pos-
sible developments. (1) Withdraw-
al by the Tokyo committee, which
is very unlikely, or, (2)  com-
bining of sufficient members of the
IOC to force some kind of vote on
the matter, which is likely if there
are enough countries reporting that
their own National Olympic Com-
mittees don’t' want the games.

It is doubtful that the latter’con-
dition exists"as' yet. Of course the
British Commonwealth and France
have shown indications of. deciding
in such a way, but they .haven’t
brought the issue: to a head. And
it doesn’t seems’ likely. that such

 

opposition will arise,‘ before the
committee meeting. ' ~ I " ~
Although there was no group;

cognizant of the political implica-
tions involved, successfuly organ-
ized to blockade American inter-
ests in the Berlin games. I be-
lieve that we have now the mak-
ings of such a body.

The National Collegiate Coaches
are now an official voice in the
Olympic proceeding. Surrounded
by the intellectual aura of the
campus, this enlightened group
should take up the picket signs.

the issue in your collective laps.

Cunningham
Praises Pitt
Trainer

By KEN RYDEN

How did the king of all milers
feel before he stepped on the
boards to defend his NYAC cham-
pionship in the Halpin mile.

In an interview with Glenn
Cunningham an hour before he
went out to win the NYAC
mile, he answered the question
with “That’s hard to say, I never
know how I feel till I hit the
track; when I feel it, I usually
feel much better.”

Soft spoken, but somewhat shy,
the Kansan preferred to talk
about Roland Logan, formerly his
trainer and now head trainerhere
at Pitt, rather than about himself.
He has utmost respect for trainer
Logan’s ability.

Not long ago Cunningham had
to visit the Panther’s Indian-
blooded trainer to relieve a ‘bad
leg condition. Attempts by East-
ern trainers to restore the leg to
normal failed. It took his old
trainer to ﬁx that half of Cun-
ningham, one leg of the two that
cover a mile better than any other
pair in the world today.

The barrel chested Glenn is in
perfect physical condition and his
performances showed it. He has
no excess weight on his person.

Cunningham is not averse to
signing autographs and is popu-
lar with fans wherever he goes.
Fellow athletes admire him and
seek advice, which he gives if pos-
all manner of judgements.

Hold First Place
In League A
By BURT JAFFE

Kappa Sigma, ‘Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Phi Kappa, and Pi
Kappa Alpha remained u.nde-
in Interfraternity
League play, after each had
won its third consecutive vic-
tory Thursday evening.

Kappa Sigma, heavy favor-
ites in League B successfully van-
quished the Pilams, 28-21. The
champs. were given quite a scar
by the chal-
lengers ..in- the
last quarter,
but managed to
keep possession
of the ball in
the ﬁnal min-
utes of play to
stave off the
Pilam sharp-
shooters, Larry
Katz and Len
Schwartz.

The fourth

quarter opened
with the Kappa

in Michelosen
Sigs leading 23-10. However, two-

pointers by Katz, Krasnow, and
Schwartz soon cut the lead 25-21.

At this point Johnny Michelosen
and company took over, and the
champs romped in victorious.
Michelosen was high point man
with eight field goals and three
fouls for a total of 19 points.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon stamped
itself as a seriousithreat to Kappa
Sigma by downing Theta Chi, 22-
16. Henry Adams led his team
with eight points. This game
proved that a good passing quintet

could. defeat. the '17-heta Chi dread-
naughts. «
In the remaining game of

League B, Sigma Alpha Mu won
its ﬁrst game by defeating the cel-
lar-holding Sigma Chi’s. The
score was 41-17. Harold Wintner
starred with 13 points."

League A was almost provided
with an upset when the Lambda
Chi» Alpha’s held the strong Pi
Kappa Alpha’s to a 15-13 score.
The Pi Kappa Alpha’s, previous
to this game, were considered a
threat to Phi Kappa’s supremacy
in League A.

The Phi Gams and the Delts put
on a close contest on the stadium
floor with Phi Gams coming over
on top due to a “Frank Merriwell”
ﬁeld goal by Jim Strickler in the
closing seconds of the game, 27-25.

Phi Kaps turned on the heat in
the second half to turn back Phi
Epsilon: Pi, 48-29. The Craig

start of the second period brought

Icemen Meet,

T0m0rroW  

Bulletin-—Pitt’s ace hockey team
will meet an ice squad from Penn
State in Duquesne Garden, Tues-
day evening, February 22. This
annoiuicement was just conﬁrmed
by James A. Hagan, director of
athletics.

John McSorley and his in-
vading Panther hockey team
went to Cleveland last Thurs-
day to show the lakeside folks
how winning hockey is played,
and administered an 8-1 drub-
bing to lﬁaldwin-‘Wallace. Not
content with only this exhibition,

they had to show them how to
light, also.
The game was very rough

throughout, although trouble never
came to a head until the ﬁnal
frame when Irv Artz and Howard
Simpkins started a free for all
that was joined in by some of the
spectators.

Up until the B—W tilt, Pitt has
depended for the bulk or its scor-
ing upon Bob Schooley or Dick
Friday. But from now on, Panther
opponents had better keep a sharp
eye on anything dressed in Blue
and Gold.

All told, six men scored the
eight goals for lVIcSorley’._s crew.
Schooley and Friday tallied twice,
each, with Kennedy, Lowe, Brit-
tain, and Conick adding one
apiece.

Irv Artz was again the best
play-maker on the ice, but didn’t
break into the scoring column.

. Coac.h..»lVlc.Sorley got quite a-
thrill out of the win and remark-
ed: “I was well pleased by the
good work of the alternate line.
They played great hockey and
most of our scoring was done with

School Teammates
'  By BILL MAZEFSKY

They ‘re four of akind; and
as handy to a swimming coach
as four acesto a poker player."

’l‘h‘eseg four sophomores, Al
Beacon, Al Slobodian, Milt
Lederstein, and';H-ymie Leder-
stein, are shuttling the Pitt
swiinining team toward a title.
Thus far the Panther swimmers
have competed infthree dual
meets, and wonthrice. The sec-
ond year quartet were standouts
in each meet.

LEAD FIFTH AVENUE

They’re more than a coinci-
dence--four. good. athletes that
just happened to "be in the same
college, on. the same team, at the
same» time. ’ About ﬁve or six
years ago they started to swim to-

they bulwarked the Fifth . Avenue
High school swimming team for
three years.  '~  .  1 '
Two years ago the two Als,’
Milt, and Hymie eaught their first
glimpse of the Pittipools ~The‘~oc-
casion was the Interscholastic Tri-
State swimming meet, - and the
boys were four-;-ﬁfths of the Fifth
Avenue High team that had en-
tered the meet. For twenty—two
years no; city-highi school had ~won
the Interscholastic trophy, and our
heroes took care of the situation.
After the meet was over, Fifth
was the Tri-State simming?
champs, and the boys took a lik-
ing to the Pitt surroundings. The

scene shifted from Fifth to Pitt,
but the boys still ‘carried on with
their winning ways and record-
breaking activities. As freshmen
they were good enough to make
Pat Corr, varsity swim coach, do
a little gloating in. contemplation
of the coming years. ' ’
BEACON SHINES

Thusfar, Al Beacon, who spec-
ializes in the 150-yard backstroke
in addition to the freestyle and
medley relays, holds the Univer-
sity backstroke -record which is
3-10 of second slower. than the
National Collegiate. time. Actual-
ly Beacon hasbettered the Na-
tional Collegiate mark, but only
marks made in competition are
recognized.

Al Slobodian also swims the
150-yard backstroke, the free-
style relay and medley relay.‘ Slo-
bodian has been clocked within
‘a split second of the Eastern Col-
legiate mark. When Beacon isn’t
crossing the ﬁnish line ﬁrst, Slo-
bodian-: is on handjto win the
event. A month back Slobodiani

ready Milt has cracked the‘_Uni-
versity 220 and«440-yard stand-
ards, and" in..each case the time ‘is
better than the Eastern Collegiate
marks.‘ In his spare time Milt is
part of Pitt’s crack freestyle relay
team. The other part of the Le-
derstein family works out on the
50' and 100-yard dash, and is a
constant meance to existing
standards.

sorts of records and marks. State

lected on the All—American High
School swimming team, the time
they broke the National high

credited, the pools records that
they can hang on their tepee, and
the time they——all of which

except that time andphpace began
to run short. 4 -

TOGETHER CONTINUALLY

Aside from being teammates,
the two Als, Milt and Hymie are
constant companions. They take
classes together, and pal around.
And they have a quartet, which
warbled during last‘ year’s Cap
and Gown.show. They plan a re-
peat actfor this year..

The boys again. warmed up to

this is.._a.sport’s article. Soin the

midst of a. slight rendition of “Bei

Mir bist du Schein” (which wasn’t
bad) the question about that Ohio
Statedual swim meet was tossed

into the midst of the “I could say 

bella, bella” routine.

Ohio State has about the best
team in the country, and the rost-
er is studded with boys that hold
National swim marks. The con-
senseus of opiion held that Ohio
State was too good, and that Pitt
would take a thumping. “But,
they ended, you can never tell!”

six years of the organization’s

by Temple in Philadelphia Fri-

Jimmy Usil'ton’s Temple Owls,
the only team in the East to de-
feat that mighty invader from the
West, Stanford, put the screws on
their first Conference‘ champion-

Pittsburgh. Pitt had it for four
years" and Maxie Hannum’s Car-
negie Tech squad saw it hanging
in the Tartan athletic ofﬁces for
one season.

Temple has only one more Con-
ference game, that with George-
town. The I-loyas are the only
league team that has beaten the
Owls. But the result of this con-
test is inconsequential as far as
standings are concerned.

Although the Panthers managed
to keep relatively close to the Owls
during the ﬁrst half, the half-time
score being 28-22, once the game
drew into i.ts meaningful stages,

TECH, DUKES NEXT

Pitt is back in the city today
and has two games to look for-
ward. to, those being with its two
local opponents, Duquesne and

Tech. Duquesne, surprising with J

a win over the wearied Tartans
last week, should be a little harder
to stomach its trip to the Stadium
Pavilion Wednesday.

If the Tartans-take things easy,

they will be rested up and ready“

to give Pitt a very tough struggle.
They loked exceptionally good
against Georgetown, and made a
better showing in Philadelphia re-
cently than did the Panthers.
The game with Tech will be

Any rumors that The 1938 Owl
will not be entirely new from
cover to cover may be disregard-
ed, according to the yearbook ed-
itor, Idella Rome, Ed38.

Even the pages dealing with the
University administration will be
covered different than in the past,
says Miss Rome. “The Owl has
nevere before attempted to gather
into one section the story of de-
partment heads. We do it this
year, and also include some top-
notch pictures taken in the ofﬁces
of the department heads and in the
Faculty Club rooms.”

Undergraduate salesmen for
The Owl are soliciting orders, the
yearbook price being $3.50. Of
this, $1.50 must be paid down, and
the remainder is to be paid on re-
ceipt of the book. Orders for
The Owl are also being taken in
