Heartbroken
at Heinz Field

Panthers give up 21-point lead and lose

the Big East Championship to River City

Rivals, the University of Cincinnati

Bearcats.

s the ﬁnal seconds ran

off of the game clock,

Cincinnati quarter-

back Tony Pike took

the ball and turned to the center

of Heinz Field. There, he joined

his teammates and‘coaches in cel-
ebration.

His Bearcats just completed a

21-point comeback against Pitt,"

winning 45-44, and secured the
Big East title.

Pike threw the winning touch- A

down pass with just 33 seconds left
in the game.

But for the Panthers,vit was a
game they could have won. After
losing the title to Cincinnati last
year, it was Pitt’s turn to win the
conference. .

A win would earn Pitt an~au-
tomatic bid to a BCS bowl game,
marking a revival for the Pitt foot-
ball program.

With such an important game
separated by just one point, a loss
like the one on Saturday takes its

‘toll on players. Just ask senior

tight end Nate Byham. It was his
last home game in a Panthers uni-
form.

“Five years ago, I told myself
I’n_1.coming to Pitt because I want
to win a Big East championship.
I wanted to be part of something
special,” he said. “Itmakes me sick
to my stomach to know that we lost
two straight. People say, ‘Hold your

head up high. You played a good
game. You’re still 9-3.’ That’s not
what we want to be. We ‘want to be
champions. Nobody remembers

the teams that are 9-3. They 're— .

member the champions.”
Byham, who caught one pass
for 6 yards against the Bearcats,
wasn’t the only vocal Panther.
Senior nose tackle Gus Mus-
takas was on the field as Pike
took a knee, letting the clock run
out.to win the game. Instead of
walking off the ﬁeld and into the
locker room, Mustakas stayed on

the ﬁeld, stunned that his team let"

such a big opportunity slip away
from them. ‘

“I don’t even know why I did
it,” Mustakas said about his deci-
sion to watch as ‘Cincinnati (12-0)
players celebrated on his ﬁeld. “I
was just stuck out there and watch-
ing them.” ~

Senior John Malecki echoed
similar statements from his team-
mates.

“I don’t know what else would
be more disappointing than losing
by a point,” the offensive lineman
said. ,

Malecki and the rest of the Pitt
seniors were honored before the

game. Quarterback Bill Stull, who V
» at times this season was among

the'nation’s top ﬁve players in
pass efﬁciency, earned a stand-
ing ovation when his name was
announced over the PA system.
That’s something that would have
been unheard of at the beginning
of the season. i

Season’s greetings
from Tower C

John Manganaro
Sta_[fWri ter

A group of resident assistants ﬁom
Tower C took on the daunting task
of spreading holiday cheer before
ﬁnals. -

The RAs -—— dressed in garb rep-
resenting different religions from
around the globe — visited almost
everyﬂoor of every campus dormbe—
tween Tuesday and Saturday, hand-
ing out candy and fliers about holiday
diversity. ,

Santa, elves and reindeer were all
present, as were traditional Muslim
and African holiday dress. ’

The Muslim dress included vari-
ous styles of thawbs, long tunic-like
garments typicallywombymeninthe
Arabian Peninsula, Egypt, Morocco
and other Muslim countries. An1_{Ain
African dress wore vibrantly colored,

hand-woven shawls wrapped around

the body.

“The whole point of this initiative
is to spread love around,” said Asdaq
Wyne, president of the Tower C Resi-
dent Student Association. “We want
to let everyone know that no matter
where in the world you are from, no
matter what your religion is, we like
to celebrate the holiday season to-
gether at Pitt — as one people of one
university.”

Wyne called the initiative a joint
effort of RAs and Tower C RSA aimed
at educating students about holiday
diversity. _

Along with a shopping cart full of

candy, Wyne and the holiday crew _

also delivered ﬂiers with information

pertainingto various winter holidays.
The fliers described Kwanzaa, Eid
al—Adha, Bodhi Day, Hanukkah and
other upcoming holidays.

- “Bodhi Day honors the enlighten-
ment of Siddhartha Gautama,” reads
the flier. “Buddhists observe the holi-
day through prayer, meditation and
teaching.”

Eid al-Adha, another holiday less
knownbyPittstudents,wasdescribed
this way:

_ “Eid al—Adha commemorates
Prophet Ibrahim’s sacriﬁce ofhis son
Ismael. Muslims observe the holiday
by attending prayer at their mosque
and sacriﬁcing animals such as sheep,
goats and cows. They then offer the
meat to their family, neighbors and
the poor.” A

By 9 p.m. Saturday, the group had
delivered its message to residents
in Towers, Lothrop, Forbes and all

ﬁve dorms in the Quad. More than P

3,000 students live inthese residence
“We just knock on doors, smile
and try to be as friendly as possible,”
Wyne said. “Who wouldn’t be excited
to see a huge cart full of candy come
down their floor?” V

Throughout the week, the can-
dy-and-cheer delivery process was
simple. Between the hours of 6 and
9 p.m., the company traversed each
ﬂoor, knocking on doors while blast-
ing seasonal songs from portable
speakers. .

Pitt student Lauren Priestap,aHol-
land resident, was caught off guard by
the groups’ holiday charm.

“This is probably the best thing
that’s happened to me all day,” she

Bamboo used in earthquake-proof construction

Pitt researchers use bamboo to improve seismic resistance in India

Carla Trinca- Conley
_ Staﬁ’ Writer

A team of Pitt students traveled to the
Indian Himalayas in May 2008 to explore
the use of bamboo as internal reinforce-
ment in masonry construction.

The trip initiated research studies on
the use of bamboo in areas of high seismic

0

risk, Bhavna Sharma, a member of Pitt’s

research team, said.

Bamboo poses advantages as a mate-
rial for construction in the Himalayan hill
region because of its rapid growth and po-
tential to improve the seismic resistance of
residential structures, Sharma said.

While on its trip in 2008, Pitt’s team
established a collaboration with Sustain-
able Hill Environment and Design, which

allowed them to team up with students
at the Indian Institute of Technology a
Kanpur, Sharma said. .

Pitt and IIT—Kanpur teams co-wrote a
proposal titled “Promotion of Bamboo as
a Cost Effective and Sustainable Structural
Material,” and submitted it to the Mon-
dialogo Engineering Award.

Sharma said Pitt developed research
and implementation plans as its respon-

cc

sibility to the proposal.

The Mondialogo Engineering Award
granted the Pitt and IIT—Kanpur teams
a silver medal fortheir project propos-
al, which includes a 10,000 euro prize,
Sharma said. A

The Pitt and IIT—Kanpur teams were
one of 30 finalists, selected from 932
proposals. ,

Although the international project
team struggled to communicate through
different time zones with the proposal, it
collaborated over e-mails,-Internet chats
and conference calls, Sharma said.

Sharma said, “Through our project we
hope to promote additional types of bam-
boo construction in the local communities
in the hill region.”

The role of the Pitt team was to con-
duct research on thematerial properties
of bamboo in addition to exploring the
durability of it, Sharma said.

When the group travels to India again
in May 2010 foradditional field research,
new developments will be transmitted to
local communities.

‘ The method of using bamboo for inter-
nal reinforcement can be used in locations
other than India. Regions in Africa also
have potential to use bamboo to improve
seismic resistance in masonry, Sharma
said. I 1
“While the technology we are working
on is globally applicable,” Sharma said,
“We presently are not focusing on imple-
mentation in developed countries.”

“The focus of the work remains sustain-
able solutions. This implies local solutions
to local problems.” -' ' ~ -

For The Pitt News

Pitt will begin its physician assistant studies pro-
gramjan. 6. Oifered throughthe School ofl-Iealth
and Rehabilitation Sciences, the programwill offer
a master of science in physician assistant stud-
ies.

A physician assistant is a “health care profes-
sional  who practices medicine with physician
supervision,” program director Deborah Opacic
said. They may take patient history, diagnose ill-
nesses, prescribe medicine, ordertests and assist
in surgery. Physician assistants work in primary
and specialty care.

The School of Health and Rehabilitation Sci-
ences had a Board of Visitors meeting two years

a physician assistant program, Marsha LaCovey,
the program’s administrator, said.

Certiﬁed physician assistants must graduate
ﬁom an accredited physician assistant program
and pass the National Certiﬁcation Examination
put out by the National Commission on Certiﬁ-
cation of Physician Assistants. Pitt’s program in
physician assistant studieswas granted provisional
accreditation by the Accreditation Review Com-
mission on Educationforthe PhysicianAssistant,
Inc.

Opacic said the commission sent representa-
tives to Pitt for two days in April. Following their

V visit, the commission gave Pitt provisional ac-

creditation in September, she said. ARC-PA grants
provisional accreditation for a limited period to
newprograms and conducts follow—up visits before
granting accreditation.

Pitt’s physician assistant programis atwo -year

in which students take courses ir1 internal medi-
cine, pharmacology and physical examination.
The second year is a clinical year of 11 rotations
in general surgery, women’s health, pediatrics,
behavioral health, emergency medicine, family
medicine and internal medicine.

To be eligible for the program, students must

joked as the group passed her dorm room. “Es-
pecially after Cincinnati won the football game.
It’s picking up my spirits a little bit.”

Abhinav Mittal, Tower C resident program
coordinator, said the projectwas initially more
about havingﬁmthan educating residents about
holiday traditions different from their own.

“The whole diversity thing kind of started
as a joke,” Mittal said. “We dressed up in all the
dilferent garb just because we could. Before long,
we realized what an opportunity this was, and
our focus shifted from candy to education.”

After realizing the opportunity, Mittal said,
the group quickly wrote up the informational
ﬂiers.

Tower C resident assistant Anthony Saba,
who dressed up as an elf and Santa Claus, agreed
with Mittal. .

“When people hear the music and come out
into the hall, it’s fun to see what they think,” he
said while suiting up late in the week. “They
don’t have any idea what’s going on at ﬁrst. In
that sense, it’s both about the message and the
way people react.”

“Not only that, it was symbolic, because
Christmas is to welcome Christ, the light
of the world.”

A ﬂoor down from Sawl, Pitt alumna
Megan Klingensmith offered descriptions
of the Chinese Room. The Chinese holiday
season, she said, places more emphasis on
the New Year than on any other holiday.
The Chinese use a lunar calendar and will
celebrate the beginning of the Year of the
Tiger on Feb. 27,2010.

The Chinese, Klingensmith said, will
hold a parade and have ﬁreworks before
sitting down with their families.

“It’s sort of like Christmas and the
Fourth of July all rolled into one,” she
said.

Klingensmith, who graduated from Pitt
in April, said she’s given Nationality Room
tours since 2005.

Every member of Quo Vadis takes an ex-

V amination on the basic information of each

of the Nationality Rooms to earn clearance
to give the tours. To learn the information
about "each nation’s holiday traditions, the
members read packets on their respective
country’s customs and sometimes talk to
the members of the committees who orga-
nize them, Klingensmith and Sawl said.

' Maxine Bruhns, director of the Nation-
ality Rooms, said she goes to great lengths
to ensure the accuracy of the rooms. She
once yelled at the organizers for putting an
image of Mickey Mouse in a room. She said
she chastised the organizers of another
room for putting up a Christmas tree when

0 the people of the country they represented

didn’t traditionally use Christmas trees.

“I think that that’s really what our pur-
pose is — to keep these things correct, even
if it’s very simple,” she said. '

To further capture the customs of
each country, Bruhns also programs en-
tertainers. Yesterday’s event included a
traditional dance performance from the

‘ Greek Odyssey Dancers. Taiko drummers

from the Bethany College Japan Outreach
and students from the Pittsburgh Chinese
School and the Peters Township Chinese

’ School also performed.

Bruhns said she enjoys watching the
groups because many of them both appeal

0 to and incorporate several generations

into their performances. Yesterday’s crowd
included small children, college students
and grandparents, among others.

The fact that the open house appeals to
several generations at once “reinforces the
fact that Pittsburgh is a multi-ethnic city,
and [these people] are keeping their culture

a alive,” she said. “I feel that’s our mission in

the Nationality Rooms — to keep alive the
music and the singing and the dancing and
all that. That could easily die out.”

Drinking policy
a safer standard

enn State has a bit of a repu-
Ptation as a party school —
last summer the Princeton
Review named it the nation’s top
party school. But now, the school’s
fraternities are working to reduce
high—risk drinking.
Come January, Penn State fra-

-ternities will implement the use of a

third party, private security agency
to monitor their parties.

These monitors will make sure
visitors are on a guest list and
will check IDs. The objective is to
keep excessive drinking, underage
drinking and general rowdiness in
check, according to the Associated
Press. I -

Deserved or not, fraternity life

‘has a reputation for its love of party-

ing and drinking, and this new ser-
vice seems an admirable contrast
to this stereotype. But the measure
wasn’t without a certain inspiration,
and in this case, a tragic one.

When Joseph Dado, 18,.of La-
trobe disappeared in September
after last being seen leaving a fra-
ternity house at Penn State, he was
found dead in a campus building’s
stairwell not far away. He died of
head trauma and had a blood al-
cohol level of .169 at the time of
his death.

After this event, administra-
tors and student leaders vowed to
implement new ways to curb high-
risk drinking. This new monitoring
system in fraternity houses is an
appropriate answer.

Such a program will cost money,
but will be well worth it to initiate.
And if the system proves successful

at a school infamously known for its
partying population, other schools
—— including Pitt — should consider
adopting. the program.

Historically, it often takes a trag-
edy to instigate change, especially
in the realm of safety measures. We
don’t need to wait for tragedy to
strike before taking a proactive step
to reduce potentially disastrous
scenarios.

Pitt is a relatively smaller school
and our reputation as a party school
doesn’t compare to Penn State’s
vehemence. It’s also worth noting
that Greek organizations already

have self-run risk management ‘

programs. But it would be naive to
assume Pitt doesn’t have a degree
of underage drinking and excessive
drinking on campus.

Only good can come from plac-
ing professional monitors at the 10-
cations of some of the largest-scale

social events on campus: fraternity;
houses. While they don’t necessar-

ily have an excess of money, Greek
organizations have the resources
necessary to collectively contract-
with such a service.

By delegating the actual moni-
toring duties to a third party, Penn
State involves a group that will be
more objective and accountable
than any other solution. They
shouldn’t have any biases toward
the administrative or student bod-
ICS.

By hiring professional security, a

Greek Life could ﬁirther combat
the “all—we—do -is-party” stigma and
establish its fraternity houses as the
safest place at Pitt to party.

the song is titled “Sexy B*tch.”

I am able to make cutting-edge

A shower radio is the best way to con-

States as well as the local goings—on of
Pittsburgh. c

I used to feel inferior when other
people made pop music references. The
people who were the life of the party
always seemed to be gettingall excited
when songs I’d neverheard came blaring

“Howdo people knowaboutallthispop

It used to be that I learned every-

it was your ticket to feeling extremely

of the world was that people gave and

people who don’tgotocollege imagine
that people who do go to college learn

Intheyear2009,you’llstillgetsome

but those props will pale in compari-

can rap the verses of “Empire State of

verses, but, after repeated exposure,

you will gain the ability to move your

mouth in such away that, if the songis

The shower radio isn’t just alifeline

It’s also a great wayto ﬁnd out what is

Health reform bill not viable

Kozlowski urges the Senate to defeat the bill

The Obama administration, while
pushing health-reforrn legislation,
has often cast opponents as wild-eyed
right—wing extremists who have dif-
ﬁculty thumping their Bibles against
their chests because the bed sheets
they are wearing get in the way. The
other challengers are greedy capital-
ist swine in the insurance business,
who oppose reform because it will
prevent them from making obscene
proﬁts while laughing maniacally at
the deathbeds of those denied cov-
erage.

I oppose this bill, and I’m not a
lunatic.

administration of the health system
would not be as efﬁcient or cost—ef-
fective as the Obama administration
would likeus to believe. Why? Look at

grams in the past.

When Congress ﬁrst passed
Medicare, the estimates on its cost
were much lower than they actually
turned out to be, and the Washington
Times notes thatcost estimates on
these sorts of programs are notori-
ously unreliable. This suggests that
nobody actually knows how much
this new bill would end up costing,
and we might end up with huge cost
overruns and the very increase in debt
President Barack Obama says won’t
happen.

Furthermore, investigations into

Medicare have shown widespread
fraud in the program. “60 Minutes”
estimated that $60 billion dollars
worth offraud occurs each year in this
program. Let’s put that number into
perspective: About $259 billion was
spent on Medicare in2002 —— mean-
ing 23 percent of the payouts were
potentially fraudulent. Using part of

every $5 the government spends on
Medicare, you could buy a couple of
cheeseburgers and nobody would
notice any difference.

This would appear to boost ,

Obarna’s assertion that eliminating
waste and fraud would save a lot of
money. But, how are we to believe
that govemment-managed health
insurance will notrun into the same

“_

I oppose this bill,
and I’m not a lunatic.

problems Medicare currently faces?
The factthat corruption and wastehas
cropped up to such a large extent in a
major government health-insurance
program should give us pause. Even
if nobody messes with Joe, even if
Obama is able to keep a hawk’s eye
on every last dollar of the umpteen-
billionthis thing is goingto cost, what. _

guarantee dowe havethatinﬁveyearslf‘-.

we won’t have runaway corruption
and waste?

Next, the very needforthis reform
doesn’t make sense. The stated goal
is to provide health insurance to the
45 million Americans who don’t have
it. My question is, then, what is the
purpose of Medicaid? Medicaid was
instituted to provide medical care to
those who could not otherwise af-
ford it. Indeed, it appears Medicaid
already helps a lot of people this
health-insurance plan is meant to aid.
Accordingto the Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services, the government

department that oversees the pro-
gram, “More than 56 million persons
received health care services through
the Medicaid program in FY 2005.”

J Granted, there are limits as to who can

receive Medicaid. But still, covering
11 million more people than are esti-
mated to be uninsured should suggest
that an expansion of Medicaid, or a
retooling of its provisions, would be
enough to provide health care to those
without insurance.

Ah, butwhat aboutthose rascally
insurance ﬁrms, the ones that don’t
pay claims? Why should we expect
the government to do any betterwith
claims and approval of service? If a
government-run insurance plan pays
for every single claim that reaches
it, then we’ll get precisely the kind
of runaway fraud that plagues Medi-
care. This means there will be denial
of certain claims, paperwork, a review
process and bureaucrats making deci-
sions about denied clairns. Wait. Isn’t
that what happens right now? Chang-
ing who makes decisions as to what
claims are paid is not going to help.

How about runaway health costs?
Again, I ask, how will government
solve these problems? The govern-

yment can say these are the prices

that will be paid for health care. As

any student of economics knows,
5' this will cause a shortage: Fewer in— ,
sﬁtutions will be willing to provide

medical care, and more people will
now visit the emergency room for a
headache because, hey, doing so is
much cheaper. All of a sudden, lines
for care will get even longer. Lower-
ing health care costs is not as easy as
simply decreeingthat they should be
lowered. There are very real conse-
quences for doing so.

For these reasons and others, the
Senate must defeat this bill.

Dickens tale gets m

“A Christmas Carol,” sponsored by,Ptttsburgh CLO, is becoming a city theatrical tradition

Andy Tybout
Staﬁ’ Writer

“A Musical Christmas Carol”
December 10-23

Byham Theater

Pittsburgh CLO

Tickets: $14 through Pitt Arts

Charles Dickens never really liked
Pittsburgh. In 1842, on avisit, he lik-
ened our city to the dreary Birming-
ham, England, and in 1868 he de-

- scribed it as “Hell with the lid off.”

But despite his repugnance at our
(now—vanished) soot and our indus-
trial drudgery, our beloved “hell” has
become a center of celebration for
arguably his most beloved tale, “A
Christmas Carol.” _ .

Hosted by Pittsburgh CLO, “A Mu-

) sical Christmas Carol” is becomingas

much a holiday tradition as, say, Light
Up Night. This, director Tim Gregory
thinks, is because of the story’s inher-
ent power.

“It’s a compelling show,” Gregory

' said. “It has the capacity to move peo-

ple. Any time you’re part ofbeing able

usical treatment

to tell a story like that it’s exciting.”

The play has a long history in
the Steel City. Now in its 18th year,
“A Musical Christmas Carol” began
when artistic director David H. Bell
was commissioned to create a musical
version of the holiday classic.

But maybe “musical” isn’t the
right word —— there are never mo-
ments when characters break out in
an original, plot-driven songnumber.
Rather, the music is what Gregory
called “standard Christmas carols
with exceptional arrangements.”
According to Gregory, the carols -
all songs the audience will recognize
-— serve the purpose of adding to the
“mood, background, underscoring or
scene change.”

In addition to the unconventional
integration of music, the play uses a
remarkably limited number of ac-
tors —- some of whom have as many
as four roles.

“Different people bring different
things to the show,”_]eff Howell, this
year’s Bob Cratchit and a 15-year vet-
eran of the play, said. “And they’re
always interesting, no matter who it
is or what character.” .

A Christmas Carol D 12

Eastwood’s road to success paved with genius

Andy Tybout
- Columnist

If you’ve seen ‘the trailers for
Clint Eastwood’s latest film, “In-
victus,” you know that America’s

‘favorite cowboy has come a long

way from-driving cattle in “Raw—
hide.” But even a man’s man like

Eastwood had a long, and not al- ,

ways smooth, ride to the top of
the Hollywood hierarchy.
Before his magniﬁcently suc-
cessful ‘fUnforgiven” (1992), peo-
ple dismissed Eastwood, think-
ing, somehow, that the IQ of his
characters equaled his actual IQ.

 

They viewed him as a has-been,
an aging relic who knew how
to put on a- good sneer, but not
much else. What they didn’t know

' was that Eastwood was about to

go through three phases, each
progressing in quality and intel-
ligence.

In the first phase (Eastwood

- One), Clint wasn’t doing much to

dispel his “dumb cowboy” per-
ception. His previous directorial
effort, “The Rookie” (1990), was
about_as cliche as it sounds — a

. far cry from his current films.

But then Eastwood threw a
cinematic left hook: He subverted
his own mythology by making
“Unforgiven.”

“Unforgiven” is as much an
examination of Western,mythol-
ogy as it is a kick-ass Western.
The protagonists are revealed to
be shadows of their perceived
selves, and the very Western en-
couragement of vigilante justice
is actively questioned. It’s a pow-
erful piece of metaﬁction, with
stunning photography to match.
As you might imagine, the critics
loved it. It walked away with four
Oscars — one for acting, one for

A directing, one for editing and one

for the coveted Best Picture.
If you had ventured Eastwood
as an Oscar contender two years

‘prior, all your movie nerd friends,
would have made fun of you.. But

in 1992, Eastwood cleaned up.
He was the alpha dog again, the
boss, but this time in the more
intellectually respected, longer-
lasting position of director. What
kind of punches would this new
Eastwood pull? Well, he was go-
ing to direct a couple mediocre
ﬁlms, lull the critics into a false
sense of security ,.. and then hit
them again.

During his Eastwood Two
phase, he made a slew of forget-
table ﬁlms, including “Midnight
in the Garden of Good and Evil”
(1997) and “True Crime” (1999).
He had moved a step up —— never
reaching the cliche lows of his
pre—“Unforgiven” spree, but

That is,.until 20o3’s “Mystic

critical praise it garnered —- in-

Scott, of The New York Times,

who said it achieves “the full

edy.”

What makes animation so captivating?
You can go on about the stylistic choices or
the technology that is supposedly “revolu—

down to it, it’s the captivating storytelling
employed by a great animated film that
turns something animated into something

In “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” director Wes
Anderson (“The Royal Tenenbaums,” “The

doesn’t simply adhere to the mold of what
stop—motion animation has done in the
past but moves forward with a unique vi-

Fantastic Mr. Fox 4 10

Fox (George Clooney) and his attempts
to simultaneously move away and back
toward his former life of stealing chickens,
ducks and cider from “the three meanest

population. -

Perhaps channeling famed animator
Don Bluth, the movie’s narrative isn’t re-
ally that of a kids’ ﬁlm in the traditional
sense. The characters are cute and chil-
dren will enjoy the bludgingly building
adventures of Ash (Jason Schwartzman)
and Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson).
When it comes down to what’s going on,
though, there’s as much adult conﬂict and
strife — for example, Mr. Fox’s troubles
adjusting to older age — as there is mirth
and adventure. Without talking down to
children or up to adults, the ﬁlm enter-
tains both in a manner that is rarely pulled
off so well.

The voice actors offer tremendous per-
formances that are truly fantastic — for-
give the pun —— with Meryl Streep’s perfor-
mance as Mrs. Fox being some of the most
emotive voice in recent animated ﬁlms.
These aren’t just big-name actors lend-
ing their voices to an animated project.
They each perform with vocal expression.
incorporating themselves into Mr. Fox’s
world. The results are captivating.

Along with the actors’ performances,

the animation work,is_.als_o superb. The en- V g A

vironments look like Wallace and Gromit
done by the production designers from
The Royal Tenenbaums, which isn’t actu-
ally too far off. Hair is bristly, liquids flow,
and although it’s animation, the detail is
so exquisite that one might even be sur-
prised to see these features in a live—action
movie. Movement, although limited by the
animation style, is fun and exciting, and

the dance moves of the whole animal clan
could make anyone smile.

Anderson’s musical selection remains
eclectic and oddly coherent: From an orig-
inal folk song by ‘ Cocker (who also plays
the role of Petey in the ﬁlm) to Anderson’s
traditional inclusion of a Rolling Stones
song (here it’s “Street Fighting Man”). It
all adds beautifully to the narrative and

helps bring both Anderson and Dahl’s
worlds to life.

“Fantastic Mr. Fox” is one of the best
animated ﬁlms in recent memory to be
released. As an animated ﬁlm, it probably
won’t get a lot of attention when awards
season comes around, but rest assured,
it’s well worth your time to live “the life
fantastic.”

in the Big East against the No. 5 or 6
team in the Atlantic Coastal Confer-
ence.

“The Panthers have had atremen-
dous season, and they have proven
worthy of their national ranking,”
bowl executive director Will Webb

waaid in a release about the game.
“We feel that this Pittsburgh team
will make the Meineke Car Care
Bowl a very exciting and competi-
tive game.”

Pitt played in this bowl once be-
fore, in 2003 when it was called the
Continental Tire Bowl, duringwhich
the Panthers lost 23-16 to Virginia.
The Panthers are 10-15 all-time in
bowl games, losing their last three.
Includingthe current streak, Pitt has
lost three consecutive bowl games

~"-‘ﬁuring four different stretches since
1927.

The Tar Heels were ranked twice
this year, losing to a then—unranked
Georgia Tech team while ranked No.
22. North Carolinawas also ranked 24

mheading into last weekend, but lost
to unranked North Carolina State.
The Tar Heels did beat then—No. 13
Virginia Tech and then—No. 14 Miami
this year.

North Carolina is 0-2 in the Car

Bowl, losing last year to West Virginia
Tand in 2004 to Boston College.

The Tar Heels are coached by
Butch Davis, who was the defen-
sive line coach for the Dallas Cow-
boys from 1989-92. Pitt coach Dave
Wannstedt was the Cowboys’ defen-

gsive coordinator those years. Davis
took over as defensive coordinator
after Wannstedt took the head coach-
ing job with the Chicago Bears.

Seniors heart-broken over loss

Football 4 1

But Stull quickly turned his game
and approach to the season around,
which makes the loss even harder for
the hometown kid who just played his
last game inunifonn inPit1sburgh.

“This is tough. All the hard work
weputinthis, allthethingsthisteam
has gone through and myself, all the
things I’ve gone through. It’s a team
game, and this one is tough to swal-
low,” Stull said.

It was an emotional game for Stull
and he let it known while answering
questions during the post—game press
conference.

“ 'ck,” Stnll said, interrupting his
response to the loss, “you don’t know
how much I love you.”_

Suillwasspeakingtoanother senior,

defensive end Mick Wlliams, who left

the press area and headed back to the
locker room.

But forByham, Mustakas, Malecki,
Stull and Williams — and the 13 other
seniors who played their last home
game on Saturday — they have to get
the’ younger players prepared for an
upcomingbowl game andthe nextyear
of Pitt football.

“We put ourhearts outthere today,’f

Byham said ofthe seniors. “The young
players need to see this and follow in
our shoes, because we have the talent
and the best coaches. There’s no rea-
son why we shouldn’twinthe Big East
next year.”

It makes me sick to
my stomach to know

that we lost two
straight.

Bill Stull

Malecki agreed.

“It’s goingto reﬂect our leadership
on the team,” Malecki said. “Guys like
Mick Williams and Gus Mustakas out
there putting their heart on the line
came into the locker room and told
everyone, ‘Right now, We’re here to-
gether. We’re a team. We’re a unit as of
this moment.”

The Panthers will conclude their
season and look for the elusive 10th
win, which would mark the ﬁrst time
they’ve donethat since the 1981 season,
whenthey playinthe MeinekeCarCare
Bowl on Dec. 26.

“There’s a lot of leaders and se-
niors on this team and we’re going to
make sure We’re ready for whatever
bowl game and whatever team that
we’ll play,” Stull said after the Cincin-
natigame. “We’ll somehow, some way,
come outwitha positive andtakeit out
on whoever we play.”

Pitt will travel to Charlotte, N.C.,
for the bowl matchup against North
Carolina. The Tar Heels (8-4) ﬁnished
founh inthe Coastal Division oftheACC
with a4-4 conference record.

“We’re going to prepare the same
waywehaveevery otherwee ”Malecki
said. “We’re goingto go out there, play

Offense struggles against New Hampshire

Greg Trietley
Staﬁ’ Writer

When Pitt’s offense clicks, call it ef-
ﬁcient and well executed, one of the
best-run schemes in the nation.

When it struggles, though, call it
sloppy and stagnant -— anoffense
that reeks of a team with ﬁve new
starters. A

And boy did the offense struggle
in the ﬁrst half of the team’s 47-32
win over New Hampshire.

“We just didn’t hit shots,” Pitt
coach Jamie Dixon said, attribut-
ing some of the struggles to “poor
shooting and bad execution.”

Pitt shot 5 for 19 from the floor

, and 0 for 6 from behind the arc

in a ﬁrst half that ended with the
Panthers up, 15-7.

“We were out of sync,” guard
Brad Wanamaker said. “We were
playing good defense, but on
the offensive end we just weren’t
there.”

Pitt had 10 turnovers and made
ﬁve ﬁeld goals at the end of the low-

«.est-scoring ﬁrst half of the college

shot-clock era. The Panthers ended

the night with 16 turnovers.
“Sixteen doesn’t look like a hor-

rible number, but in a low posses-

sion game it stands out a little bit V

more,” Dixon said. “We fumbled
away some balls away that we just
normally don’t do.”

Players share the blame for the
sloppy play. Seven different Pan-
thersturned the ball over in the
ﬁrst half, and no player did more
than twice.

“Turnovers are always going
to affect how you play on offense,”
Ashton Gibbs said. “For some rea-
son we just kept dropping balls to-
day, and they led to turnovers.”

Pitt’s offense looked listless ear-
ly against New Hampshire. Without
a returning starter on the court,
the team might lack leadership as
players ﬁnd their roles.

Sims, Harrison ‘unstoppable tandem’ on court

Several leaders emerge on the women’s basketball team

Kelly Flanigan
Staff Writer

Point guard Jania Sims and 6-foot guard
Taneisha Harrison usually run the show
on the women’s basketball team.

Head coach Agnus Berenato even refers
to Sims as the team’s “quarterback” —— its
leader.

When Sims and Harrison are on the

court together, the unstoppable tandem
is one of the best in women’s college bas-

 ,_:-,-_.l.<etvbal’l, In‘fact,.-they have combined for
  near1_yj‘20b,pt_)fi_'{__ll:AS§iiinjust seven games this

contribute solid‘ efforts, as well. With

signiﬁcant height atgboth positions, the

Panthers will bring down many rebounds
this season, as well as score heavily in
the paint.

Recently, several other players stepped
up and made themselves known as scoring
threats for the No. 20 Panthers (7-0). As
Big East play approaches, this will become
increasingly‘ important.

Junior Chelsea Cole, a 6-foot-3 forward,
has made a substantial impact in the paint

so far this season. As a starter in five of
this season’s games, she averaged almost
28 minutes of play.

She can play at either the four or the
ﬁve position, but Berenato moved her to
the role of ﬁve in the Thanksgiving Tour-
nament. T

“We felt that Chelsea Cole could be the
ﬁve rather than the four. Appalachian
State was a little quicker than us in the ﬁve
spot, so we made the switch. Chelsea can
contain like a guard and has been in this
position for,u_s in~th,e_ last week of practice
during drills,v”’B'e_renato said.

Berenato madefit a point to say that

"Cole continues to improve with. each

game» .

On the season, Cole has 72 points and
has grabbed 57 rebounds.

“My conﬁdence is going up a lot. It
helps that my teammates have the con-
ﬁdence in me to keep giving me the ball
and that my coaches have conﬁdence in
me,” Cole said.

She collected two double—doubles this
season, one against Marshall and the other
against Florida.

Another huge presence in the paint,
6-foot—6 center Shawnice “Pepper” Wil-
son, a sophomore, was selected as an All-

7-»

ISCUNT-with Statue

Big East Freshman Player last year.

Her accurate shooting from the field

“I think she ﬁnally started feeling a
comfort zone where she needs to be on the

block. She’s believing that she doesn’t have
to put the ball on the ground, she doesn’t
have to take six moves, she doesn’t have to
go backward. She has to catch and score,
and I think she is getting the conﬁdence,”
‘Berenato said.
Prior to a knee injury, Wilson was also
a ﬁnalist for the USA Basketball U—19
squad. ’
She started in three of Pitt’s ﬁrst seven
‘ games, scoring 49 points and collecting

$7

27 rebounds.

Kate Popovec, a 6-foot-3 forward,
proved last year that she can be competi-
tive in the post position during Big East
play. ,3,

She has made small but consistent
contributions from the bench so far this
season. She made her ﬁrst start in the
Youngstown State (0-7) game, where she
also collected her ﬁrst double-double of
the year.

Berenato also started Popovec on
Saturday against the Western Michigan
Broncos (3-4).

The Panthers will look to her through-
out the season to boost their inside re-
bounding game. .

Popovec has collected 39 points and
38 rebounds this season. I

Three years ago, Pitt won its ﬁrst 12
games of the season. Now, the women are
off to their second best start in program
history.

Despite the promising start, Berenato
knows her team still has a long way to
go.

“We are a young team, we are a differ-
ent team. We are a work in progress. You
have to go through it to get better at it the
next time,” she said.

It is doubtful we will ever know the complete details of the Tiger Woods car-crashing

Greg Trietley

 

So Tiger Woods crashed his car. Apparently
it’s a big deal. ’
I’m a bad judge on what is newsworthy.
When news broke from the Woods camp last
weekend, I thought about writing a column
on the incident but initially decided, “He
just crashed his car. Not a big deal.” '

I recant my earlier position.

Here are the known facts. At 2:30 a.m.
last Friday, Woods pulled out of his drive-
way and reportedly drove his car through
a hedge, over a ﬁre hydrant and into a tree.

his Cadillac Escalade with a golf club and

What cﬁsued was a real-world adapta-

’ tion of the board game Clue that continued

into a second week of play. Every media out-
let decided that it was its duty to read into
the sketchy details and infer wild theories
on whatyhappened. _ ' .
Where was Woods going in the early-
hours after Thanksgiving?-Why did his wife
smash a window with a golf club when doors
have been around since the 18505? Where
did the club come from? Was it a Titleist‘?—
By now —— I’m led to believe —— Woods

Pitt relies on backcourt too much

Basketball 1 14

Lucas Felak I STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Guard Ashton Gibbs and the rest of the Panthers defense fortiﬁes the defense.

I — ‘could step into that leadership role. In close

games against Wofford, Duquesne and New

Hampshire, the two guards ultimately gave

Pitt the win.

Gibbs’ 10 straight points against the Wild-
cats to close out the ﬁrst half and start the
second half changed the momentum of the
game, New Hampshire coach Bill Herrion
said.

Pitt, might actually rely on the promising
young backcourt too much at the moment,
however. In the team’s lone loss, Texas fo-
cused on shutting down the Panthers in the
post, and Pitt struggled to sustain anything
on offense outside of two 3-pointers from
Lamar Patterson. _ -

Gibbs and Wanamaker accounted for,42 of
Pitt’s 47 points against New Hampshire. The

4 other three starters did not score.

“We were just taking what they gave us,”
Gibbs said. “We weren’t trying to be selﬁsh
with it at all. Our teammates did a great job
getting us the ball.”

There’s talent in the backcourt and talent
underneath the rim, but eight games into the

season, it hasn’t gelled together just yet. Many .

passes inside the paint slipped off ﬁngertips
or landed just out of reach.

But while Pitt struggles on offense, the
team can always count on its defensive play

{I

Panthers scored only 15 points against the
Wildcats by halftime, they held New Hamp-
shire to 3 for 25 from the ﬂoor.

With the defense fortifying the Panthers,
Dixon can take time to develop the offensive
side of the ball. As poorly as Pitt played in the‘,
ﬁrst half, the team shot 52.2 percent from
the ﬂoor in the second half, racking up 32
points.

“I thought we played a good second hal ,”
Dixon said. “We didn’t play a good ﬁrst half,
but I guess I’d rather have it that way than _
the other way around.” i

Dixon said limiting turnovers played a
role in turning the offense around. _

“We had six in the second half and 10 in
the ﬁrst half,” he said. “And you can see we
had a better second half offensively.”

In the ﬁiture, Pitt will succeed offensivelyh
as long as it keeps with its plan,. Dixon said.

“If you stick with your stuff and you con-
tinue to believe in what you’re doing,” Dixon
said, “you end up ﬁnishing strong, and that’s
what we did.[against New Hampshire] .”

The long stretches of poor play against
Duquesne and New Hampshire might still
worry some, however.

“You have to kind of be concerned,” Wa-
namaker said. “But I’m not so much. Soon
we’ll put it all together and play a full 40
minutes.”

Media jumping to conclusions about Woods

Oh, you know it’s true. It’s reported.

Woods also reportedly chipped in for

his facial lacerations. .

Uchitel has publicly denied any affair O

with Woods since the story broke.

“No matter how intense curiosity about
public ﬁgures can be,” Woods wrote, “there
is an important and deep principle at stake,
which is the right to some simple, human

from this statement. ‘The first conclusion:
Leave Woods alone. To be fair, when Woods
struggles, he always has trouble driving

joke? Damn.) A '

The alternative conclusion:~The truth
must be really juicy.

In the end, we might never know what
occurred. But I know that I don’t care.

If a tree falls in the Woods and there’s
no one there to hear it, it won’t make a
sound, but feel free to speculate about the
