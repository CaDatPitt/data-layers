Information Center

For Draft Objectors  
Restates 1967 Laws

T-he following has been prepared by the Pittsburgh Draft Infor-
mation Center and Central Committee for Consciencious Objectors:
STUDENT DEFERMENTS UNDER 1967 LAW

The_ new draft law provides for two kinds of deferments for
students, I-S, and II-S, just as before. But under the old law, II-S
was granted at the discretion of the local boards; now it is manda-
tory for undergraduates who satisfy nominal requirements and for
graduate students in (approved fields only), except that provision
is made for discretionary deferment of graduate students not in ap-
proved fields who are enrolled in a graduate school by October 1,
1967, or who are entering their second or subsequent year of study

by that date. I-S remains mandi-
tory for undergraduates who re-
ceive induction orders during an
academic year, but it is no lon-g-
er available to graduate stu-
dents. As before, accepting a II-
S does not jeopardize a consci-
entious 0-bjector claim, and fill-
ing a CO claim does”’not affect
eligibility for a II-S.

Any man who is given I-S or
II-S automatically incurs extend-
ed draft liability to age '35. But
current call-up regulations pre-
vent drafting of men over 26,

‘even if they have extended lia-
bility. Exceptions are doctors,
dentists, veterinarians and allied
specialists, who are drafted to
age 35. Any man, graduate or
undergraduate, who is given II-S

after July 1, 1967, automatically -

foregoes any future eligibility
for III-A dependency deferment.
The possible exception is with
registrants from Illinois where
t-he State Director has issued‘ a
directive to local. boards defying
the executive order and declar-
ing that “A graduate“ student,
not II-S as an undergraduate af-
ter July 1, 1967, will not be

I barred from receiving a III-A
cla-ssificat-ion if II-S as a ‘gradu- ,
" ate student.”——State Memoran-

dum No. 6-21E

Undergraduate Deferments

-Previous scores‘ in the SSO-
QT’s willbe ignored. II-S defer-
ment is now mandatory for un-
dergraduates so long as the fol-
lowing conditions are met each
year: (a) Student has requested
II-S deferment in writing (all
freshmen in particular MUST
request a II-S as well as stu-
dent-s already possessing a. II-S),
(b) School has sent Student Cer-
tiﬁcate form No. 1109 to the 10-
cal board, (c) Student is taking-
a full time course lead and is

' receiving credit toward a de-

gree, (d) Student is making sat-
i.-factory progress toward a de-
gree (e.g. 25% first year, 50%
second, etc), (e) Student has not

' reached his 24th birthday. To

obtain II-S a registrant should

make written request and see '

that his school has _sent form
No. 109. If just entering college,
a registrant should send photo-

copies of his letter of admission"

and deposit receipt to his local
board as early as possible, along
with -written request for a II-S.
II-S is. granted for one academic
year at a time, and the regula-
tions now specify that in determ-

SG Senate Resolution Urges
Revamped Student Union if

by Paul Stoller

(See ed2'to'r2'al—“A Call Fm A
Students’ Um'om—Page 4)

Student government (SG)
passed yesterday a bill call-
ing for a revamping of the
current organization of the
Student Union. The bill pass-
ed byla vote of 16 to 5.

The bill was sponsored by Se-n- ‘

ators Richard Campbell, Galiby
Edwards, Loren Hershy, Jona-
than Meyers, Joan Saltzman,
and Frank Tutino. The sponsor-s
of the bill cited that “it is the
Student Government’)-s duty to
protect the interest of the stu-

. dent-’i_

“The proposed change of the
“Student Union” to the “Pitt
Union” is one o-vert example of
this erosion,” according to the
sponsors of the bill.

In lieu of the conditions stat-

' ed, the committee made the fol-

lowing resolutions:
>A Specified area in Schen-
ley Hall should be designated as
the‘ “Student Union” until a
building which is solely a Stu-
dent Union can be con-s-tructed.
‘D The specified area should be

' coordi-nated and ~direct‘e'd by ‘stu-

dents. , -
>These students should be
chosen either by.‘ the student
body or by the student body’s
elected representatives. ‘
>All funds allocated to this
“Student Union” for an of its
activities should be granted

Fraternities Give Tea

~ by Steve Gittleson

On Sunday, September 10,
Delta Tau Delta, Phi Epsilon
Pi, Sigma Chi, and Theta Chi,
-all adjacent fraternities on Bay-
ard Street, jointly gave a tea for
the occupants of the newly fin-

’ished town houses across the

street from them. The plan for
the tea was originated by Dick
Chelfant, Vice-President of Del-
ta Tau Delta, to promote good
relations with the fratern_ities’

' new neighbors.

As John Anderson of Delta
Tau Delta expressed it, the fra-
ternities felt it was an obliga-
tion to show the residents of the
town ‘ houses what to expect

' from the 350. members of the
‘ four fraternities. Mr. Lou-is Mc-

Clinden, assistant dean of tra-
ternity affairs, said that a maj-
or portion of’the community
neighbor relations problem

, could be alleviated by getting to

know the neighbors.

The tea was held at the Delta

Tau Delta house, with six out '

of the seven families, all offi-
cers of the four fraternities, and

some parents attending. Primar-.

ily. a social gathering, the. tea

" also I.ir:i_c_luded informal; discus-

   

McClinden, who described him-
self «as an observer of the event,
said that the ‘neighbors were im-
pressed with the high calibre o-f

7.'students representing the fra-

ternities. He’ related an anec-

dote told at the tea by one of-
‘uhe town house neighbors. After I

finding her living room windows
broken, the neighbor called the
police. When questioned about
Fraternity involvement in the
vandalism,’ she persisted that
none of the fraternity men were
responsible. She was proud to
say that the vandals were found

. to be eleven and twelve year old

boys and not fraternity mem-
bers. -

.McClinden stated that no Pro-
gram to establish a cordial rela-
tionship between fraternities
and their neighbors had ever
been attempted before, but saw
the tea as a promising indica-
tion for the future. For instance,

he continued, all four fratern-
« ities on Bayard have been going _

through extensive revamping to

keep their houses in tune with

speech at SG meeting.

through the Student Govern»

ment Allocations committee.
Loren Hershy, who made the
motion, stated that “at this Uni-
versity, student interests are be-
ing overlooked.” He cited that
the Student Union “didn’t even
consult us” about the office
changes of the summer. “We
want a Student Union where we
can use meeting rooms at will,”
said Hershey. “We want a situa-

tion where power and influence

won't filter out of our hands.”

 ».~_Her.sh_ey’s contention was re-

futed from the floor by Jeff
Zdrale, publicity director of the
Student Union‘ Board (SUB).
Zdrale said t-h-at he didn't be-
lieve that there its a lack of
student planning in the S-UB.
He also pointed out that “it

Student Government at the
University, -in conjunction with
the office of-the Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs, has formed a stu-
cent committee to study and
evaluate the present, freshmen
orientation‘ system. The commit-
tee, with Jack La Pietra as
chairman, will study all aspects
of the present orientation in-
cluding academic counseling, so-
cial events, and administration
speeches and luncheons.

The committee will construct -

and administer a survey of the
present freshmen class through
the women’s mentor and men’s

The survey hopes to elicit criti-
cisms and useful suggestions
from freshmen who have recent-
ly participated" in the orientation
program. The survey form will
also be available to ~upperclas_s-

‘ In the Heat of the Night is a
:-movie that should have been a
f flop. It is, without a doubt, the
biggest collection of cliches to
hit the screen since The Sound
of Music.
Take Sidney Poitier, for ex-
example. If H. Rap Brown has
a “most hated” list, Mr. Poitier
would undoubtedly sit on the
top. He has been good to almost
.every_ human being that has
ever lived. He built a chapel for
-some nuns, and he built the
characters of a bunch of British
school kids. He has been an al-
most perfect Uncle Tom.
Whatever Whitey needs, Poi-
tier is always there, full of en-
thusiasm and virtue. In Lilies
of the Field, he was right there
to help a group of indigent nuns
to build a chapel. To Sir With
Love, he was the strong but un-
derstanding teacher who some-
’ how manages to reform an en-
tire class of delinquents. The
central point of both these mov-
ies is that Mr. Poitier must win
the respect of people who are
‘either unwilling or unused to
giving it to him.
In the Heat‘ of the Night is
no exception. Basically, it is the
story of Poitier’s successful at-
tempt to find the murderer of

a Northern industrialist who

plans to set up a factory in a ‘

small Mississippi town. To do
this, he must win the respect
and assistance of the Sheriff,
played by Ros Steiger.

The circumstances of Poitier’s '

involvement in the crime sets
the tone of the movie. Poitier is
waiting at the town's train sta-
tion to take him back to Phila-
delphia and his job as one of
the city’s top homicide experts.
He is picked up here on suspi-
cion—-a rich-looking Negro in
a town where everybody else is
virtually destitute.

The deputy who arrests him,
in perfectly typical southern
fashion, refers to him as “boy,”
treats him with every insult.pos-
sible, and generally makes his
feelings about Negroes very,
very clear.

When Poitier is brought in
front of the sheriff, the same
performance is begun again. The
only difference is that where the
deputy who arrested him did it
half for the funof it, Steiger
begins the interview convinced
that Poitier is, in fact, guilty.

You get the idea that if Poi-
tier did not begin to tire of the
game and .flash his badge, Steig-
or would have dragged him in

ate the current shortage of both
specialists in urban problems
and broad-gauge administrators
of city-wide development pro-
grams.’?

Grants are made to students
who engage in full-time gradu-
ate study for careers in urban
public service. They are expect-
ed to focus on the development-
al prognam of modern cities.

The four students are Rocco

So there it is——the ambi.tious
young Negro, the tight li-ttle
Southern town, the redneck cop.
One cliche after another, yet it
is certainly one of the best mov-
ies of the year. There is one big
reason for this—‘Steiger’s por-
trayal of the sheriff. In scene
after scene, Steiger captures the
mood of a man at once out of
his element when it comes to
solving the crime, yet unbeliev-
ably shrewd in his judgment of
men and situations It is this
constant interplay of certain
prejudices with the uncertain-
ties of the investigation that al-
lows Steiger to raise his role,
and the entire picture with it
from cliche to a constantly in-
teresting drama.

3“Heat of Night” Captures Mood New Reducing Drug

Investigators at the Univers-

The drug, known as fenflura-

The report on the findings
was contained in two scientif-ic

Urban Affairs Department.

The University’s Graduate
School of Public, and Interna-

pointed Edward C. Biegert as
research associate in its urban
affairs department.

The appointment is sponsored
jointly by GSPIA and the Unit-
ed Oakland Ministry where Mr.
Biegert serves as director of the
Division of Urban Life. ‘The
United Oakland Ministry is an
ecumenical and community cen-
tered ministry thathas develop-
ed in the ‘academic, medical and

Mr. Biegert will init-ially in-
vestigate the relationship of the
religious community to housing,

focusing particularly upon the
housing problems of minority
groups. ‘

A resident of Pittsburgh since
1962, Mr. Biegert has served as
a University Chaplain with the
United Campus Ministry of the
United Presbyterian Church —
U. S. A. and the United Church
of Christ.

Mr. Biegert is actively engag-
ed in many civic and community
affairs including the Pittsburgh
Area Religion and Race Council,
the South Oakland Citizen’s
Council, and the local and state
board of the American Civil Li-
berties Union. ‘

fessors Joseph P. Buckley and
William J. Kinnard, Assistant
Resident Professor Harold H.
Smookler, and pre-doctoral stu-
dents Ronald Ziance and I.
Glenn Sipes. . ‘

Dr. Buckley said the drug
compound has been used in Eu-
rope for several years as an aid
to weight reduction. Present ef-
forts at the University seek to
determine the mechanics of its
action on the body.

The investigators said that
the drug, unlike amphetamines
such -as dexedrine and zenza-
drine, produces a mild sedative
effect and does not increase the
blood pressure. Doctors Buck-
ley and Smookler and student
Sipes said the mechanism of ac-
tion appears to be an interfer-
ence and depression of the chem-
icals in the body responsible for
stimulating the heart and blood

 

vessels and the central nervous.

system. Dr. Kinnard and student
Ziance said fenfluramine had op-
posite effects to amphetamines
on the central nervous system
and also confirmed that the com-
pound decreases the neurotrans-
mitters in the central nervous
system. .
Dr. Buckley stated that the
compound is now getting clini-
cal trials under the direction of
A. H. Robins Company of Rich-
mond, Virginia, and indicated
that if clinical effects on hu-
mans are similar to those ob-
served in animals, the drug
should permit individuals to lose
weight wit-hout overstimula-tion
and without suffering cardiovas-
cular effects common to amphe-
tamine-type compounds.

 ONE FACT is quite clear
about the recent election in

cal climate of South Vietnam
-reeks from the stench of foul

"___a'dership. South Vietnam is
_still.plagued by its same old
problems. ' _

'1‘-he stench emanates from
leadership which lacks the
opular support of its peo-
ple. This sort of unfortunate
situation can only breed po-
litical instability.

"if It should be realized that
the real issue at stake in Vi-
tnam is politics. The great-
est need of a small nation
like" Vietnam, according to
W, W. Rostow, special ad-
visor to.the president, is to
procure a strong government
that has popular support.

 Student Government (SG) has awakened from a state of lethargy to
umeiits role on our campus. In passing the bill to secure a Student Union
our students, SG'has taken that first step in exercising its responsibili-
tiigesto act in the best interests of our student body.
.f*‘Students have been victimized far too long by the state of affairs
th thave existed in the operation of the Pitt (Student) Union——-a state of
affairs which has been “off limits” to us. It is disgraceful that our Student
Covemment does not as yet have a usable office for the current year and
 no recourse but to accept this inconvenience. But do we have to accept
this? If the‘ Senate reaction to this and other actions taken by Pitt Union

  We heartily concur with the point made by Senator Bill Ralph that
.- the title “the Pitt Union” is ‘perhaps the best—it most aptly describes what

the nee-ds of the people. In-
stead, they persue a hope-
less, futile war.

Although the new “popu-
larly elected” regime says it
is in search for a settlement
of the war, it really isn’t in
any position to make the
concessions necessary for
peace. This is why the re-
cent peace feelers were re-
buked by Ho Chi Mihn and
his cohorts. ,

In short, there is no real
hope of ending the war un-
der the present military ori-
ented regime.

ONE AUTHORITY who
holds this viewpoint is‘Tran
Van Dihn, former acting Vi-
etnamese Ambassador to the
United States. “There is a
need,” says Tran, “to fur-

'ter a new political climate in

South Vietnam.”

Tran believes that the foul
political climate of South Vi-

U.S. He believes that with
a great deal of courage the
U.S. policy makers could re-
verse their traditional policy
of supporting military re-
gimes.

Yet, the responsibility
rests with the United States.
We (U.S.) are the one-s who
can ultimately decide the
fate of Vietnam. We can de-
cide whether or not the war

will continue. We are the .

ones who have the power-to
stop the death and the atroc-
ities.

IT WOULD.be foolish to

assume that President John-

son is not aware of these vi-
tal factors. He is, after all,
a shrewd man. Yet, does
President Johnson have the
courage to alter his strict
policies.

Basically, the President
has a choice between death
and economy. The President
can stop the deaths by either
making enough concessions
to the N. Vietnamese to war-
rant a settlement or with-
drawing his troops. ‘

On the other hand, John-
son can continue to bol-
ster the “war economy” by
escalating the war.‘ By
means of the War in Viet-
nam, it shouldbe noted, the
U.S. economy has reached
new heights. Moreover, the
U.S. economy has avoided a

feared recession.

AS COULD be expected,
President Johnson has a
very" political decision to
make concerning Vietnam.
If he pulled the troops out
of Vietnam thus ending the

’ war, the U.S. would prob-

Episode Two '

Manning made the following observation at Tap Day six months ago. “Why
does the SUB have no duly elected student chairman? Do the students sit
as a panel under the control of their advisor? If it is so, then it is impossi-
ble for a student to perform in his proper capacity or to receive a Valuable
learning experience from his extracurricular activities. The unfortunate
thing is that usually the real fault lies with the students for permitting the
situation to arise.”
The situation has unfortunately arisen, and must now be rectified.

We urge Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar to establish a committee comprised
of faculty, administrators,‘ and students to investigate thepoints made in,
the Senate bill.
The Senate has taken that first step. We only hope that the adminis-
tration will recognize SG by airing the student’s grievances through they -
. proper channels. "

The Dorm Rat Enters

The story so for: Fresh Mam.
enlists the aid of Commuter in
his attempt to save a, commuting
freshman from senior harass-
ment. -

THE MOB of enraged com-
muters congregated outside the
Student Union. One fell-ow held
highithe flashing Commuters At
Work sign, designed to pacify
PAT busdrivers, who would ob-
vriously be scared out of their
Wits upon seeing such a gang
waiting so near a bus stop. But
the universally-reco-gnized -sign
immediately puts them at ease.

Fresh Man, who had in the
meanti-me changed -his outfit
somewhat,‘ from madras sport
jacket to Allderdice High School
jacket, with ‘_‘AAA City Basket-
ball Champs, 1966” inscribed on

s the front,’ spotted Dorm Rat’

Weridin-g’ his Way toward the
gathering, from which began to
emanate ominous rumblings.

Dorm Rat, who always trav-
els in circles or arcs thereof, af-
ter years -of circular dorm liv-
ing, was easily recognized for
his mammoth pair of sunglass-
es which shielded his eyes from
the un-accustomed light of day.

—HE HAD just finished lead-
-ing the 3,000 rn-an R-at Patrol in
Dorm Rat Calistheniics, which
consisted of runningin place for
a half hour straight. This exer-
cize was for the purpose of de-
veloping Ra-t Legs, against the
‘time when the elevators don't
work.

Leading his ﬂock, Dorm Rat-
would say, “Faster, you rats,
.you’re late for night lab, fas-ter,
we’re only on the fifteenth floor.
Faster, faster, we're -on thirteen,

Relentlessly, Dorm Rat would

make his charges immediately

simulate ‘Return From Night

never complained, for he always _

did -the exercises with them.
AND NOW he was venturing

in daylight, making his Way‘

through Scotty's driveway, and
anound Sennot Slt., up Bigelow,
and -back around to Forlbes,
where he ran into Fresh Main.

“Sorry Fresh Man,” he’apoC_lo-
gized, “I didn't see you. What’s
up?”

“Trouble. Some seniors are
trying to sell one of my fresh-

» men an elevator permit.”

“REALLY? WHAT are they-.
as'k'ing?” 0
“Two dollars a Week.”

“Holy Circles, that’s outrag- ‘
eous,” fumed Dorm Rat, “I can-

get them for you at half that.”

“TILANKS, RAT, I knew I
could count on you.”

Suddenly, from out of the
mob of milling commuters,-came
the cry, “Who’s that? Is he one
of those out-of-starte seniors?
Who is that?”

The -Commuter calmed his le-
gi0I1S by saying, “Down, stout
fellows, he's one of us.”

DORM RAT, livid with rage,
screamed, “You m=ise1"able, im-
perfect 1-ine-walkers.” _

“Easy, Rat,” said Fresh Man,"
they're excited. You know.”

‘‘It’s all right, Man.” And he

Play Celebrates Atomic Age.

 

  

 

A musical comedy of the
atomic age written by two
University staff members

G has proved to be such a hit,

the city of Oak Ridge, Tenn.
is planning to stage it as a
yearly event.

The musical comedy “A
Thousand Suns" -written by
Helen Knox, associate .director

of News and Publications, Bruce .

Hall,’ and Esther Kitzes, direc-
tor of Student‘ Publications,
Schenley Hall, closed last week

after playing to 10,000 people -

during its seven performances.

The playwrights were commis-
sioned by the city of Oak Ridge,
home of the atomic bomb, to
write a play commemorating the
25th anniversary of the atomic
age, and to depict the history of

the city in East Tennessee which _

was created to manufacture the
Uranium 235 which went into
the first bomb.’ ‘

“It was a very difficult as-
signmentr-how _do you write a
comedy about such a. frightening

.subjec ,” remarked Mrs. Kitzes.

\_ “We solved it by re-creating the

blast dugout scene on the Alma
gordo desert as it really happen-
ed-—a very serious, tense scene.
The rest of the show lent itself
to a light, comical portrayal. For
‘ example, when General Leslie
Groves, head of the Manhattan
Project asks for an additional
two" hundred million dollars to
expand the uranium plants, Gen-
eral Marshall approves; the
scene ends with an historically
correct‘ incident: General Mar-
shall’s wife calls to remind her
husband to pay a grass seed bill
for $1.65.” -
The writing _of “A Thousand

Suns” could be considered to be ‘

unique in playwriting. Miss
Knox and Mrs. Kitzes wrote the
script in Pittsburgh; the -lyrics
and music were Written 600
miles away in Oak Ridge, Tenn.
by Mrs. Betty Osborn. The lines
of communication were the

Southern Bell Telephone and the‘ Washington, D. C. to see the

U.S. air-mail service.

The title for the two and- a
half hour show was chosen in
Canter’s restaurant in Oakland

- at a work-session luncheon. It

comes from a sentence uttered
by General Farrell, who watch-
ing the explosion of the first
atomic bomb exploding over Al-
magordo, New Mexico, cried out:
“It’s brighter than a thousand
suns!”

Th-ere was only one week-end
work session together with Mrs.
Osborn and play director Paul
Ebert who came to Pittsburgh
“for a mad, wild, round-the-
clock, food-brought-in work ses-
sion,” said Mrs. Kitzes.

Says Miss Knox: “We read
every book we could get on the
Manhattan Project, Oak Ridge,
and the hectic- years between
1942 and 1945 when Oak Ridge,

. Los Alamos- and Handford were

being built. We had the chal-
lenge of dramatizing the Man-
hattan Project which at one time
employed two million people
and has been called ‘the greatest
combined human undertaking in
the history of mankind’ ” ,

General Leslie Groves who
headed up the Manhattan Pro-
ject came to Oak Ridge from.

' play..The general, now 71 years‘

of age, was! accompanied by his
13-year-old grandson, Richard,
_who turned and grinned broadly
with an .“I-love-you-grandpa”
grin when he first saw the play

actor on stage portraying his

grandfather.

General Groves found two
complaints in the -playwrights’
portrayal: “I did not wear the
-peak-billed general’s hat — I
always wore an overseas cap.
Also, I didn’t smoke a cigaret
during the bomb scene.”

The playwrights had General
Groves ask physicist Robert Op-
penheimer for a cigaret during
the tense scene. Oppenheimer
replied: “I thought you didn’t
smoke, general,” but produces
the cigaret. The playwrights
pointed out to the real General
that two history books reported
the incide'nt,,‘but he dismissed it
with: “I was calm the entire
evening." _ .

In the audience was a grand-
son of Dr. Stafford Warren, med-
ical officer for the Manhattan
project who witnessed the play
actcr’s account of his grand-
father’s' role in the bomb scene.
Also in the aucﬂence were dozens
of Oak Ridge scientists who

 

  OakRidgeCommissionsittlaywright  

worked on the Manhattan Pro-
ject 25 years ago, including Dr.
Alvin Weinberg, presidential ad-
visor on scientific affairs for
President Lyndon B. Johnson.
Thellmusical comedy ‘was one
of dozen events planned by the
city for a year-long aalebration
of its silver anniversary. - Par-
ticipating were Tennesee Gover-
nor Buford Ellington, Senator

"Albert Gore of Tennessee, and

Atomic Energy Commission of-
ficials from Washington, D.C.

Miss Knox and Mrs. Kitzes
were commissioned to write the
play because they had lived in
Oak Ridge for ten years and
had written two musical com-
edies with Mrs. Osborn in the
Fifties which were produced by
the Oak.Ridge Playhouse. The
shows were spoofs on cowboys
and the Roaring Twenties:
”Horse-O-Rama” and “Flappera-
ma."

“I guess they like our sense of
humour down there,” says Mrs.
Kitzes.

f “But in telling the story of
the Atomic Age and the people

- who created it, we hadto switch

to an entirely different type of
humor; no spoofing, rather

straight sohisticated humor,”

says Miss Knox.

“Of course, we were helped"

by real comedians like the late
Nobel Prize Winner Enrico Fer-I
mi, who, on the night before
the bomb blast, was taking
bets, money wagers, on wheth-
er ‘it would blow up New Mex-

ico, or the whole world,” she_

pointed out.

The idea for a musical com-
edy was broached in winter of
1966. Said Paul Ebert, director
of the Playhouse,“ I told the
city fathers it couldn't. be done
on such short notice. I said the
only possibility, a really far-
fetched one, was to have it writ-
ten by Esther Kitzes and Helen
Knox who left Oak Ridge -about
ten years ago. But they were

Dr. Ciocco said, “The graduate
School of Public Health was

of urban and industrial areas
everywhere and would continue
for many years to be a signifi-
cant force for the betterment of
the Bittsburgh area in particu-
-lar. Tlhis appointment under-
lines its founding principle and
is evidence, once again, that the
school does not end its responsi-
bility with teaching and re-
search. I ,

career in public health" service,‘
not only in the academic field
but with governmental agencies.
A native of New Orleans, Louis-
iana, he received BS. and M.D.

ish Health Units in Louisiana.

from 1935 to 1938, and finally
as President of the State Board
of Health and State Officer. Be-
fore coming to the University he
was Professor of Public Health
Administration at the Tulane
University ‘School of Medicine

' and was acting chairman of the

Department of Tropical Medi-
cine and Public Health.

Dr. Treuting is a past presi-
dent of the Pennsylvania Acad-
emy of Preventive Medicine and-
of the Pennsylvania Public
Health Association. He -has serv-
ed as consultant to the World
Health Organization and in vari-
ous advisory committees of the
US Public Health Service-

Since coming to the Univers-
ity, Dr. Treuting has been a
member of the Health and Wel-
fare Standing Committee of the

sions; Council of University Sen-
ate since 1964; member ad hoc
committee to evaluate the Ford
report, 1966; member of the
Chancellor’s Committee on
Space Utilization, 1966. His re-
search has been in the fields of
epidemiology, microbiology, and
public health administration and
he has published a score of pa-
pers.

Dr. ‘Wesley W. Posvar, chan-
cellor of the University, said
that the appointment of Dr.
Treuting is “a significant ex-
-ample of the kind of interrela-
tionship which mu-st be fostered
between the university and its
community.”

 ‘STRAIGHT
TALK

  

by’ ay Rosenstein
Sports Editor

 

A CHANGE IN THE GAME

When the NCAA Rules Committee ‘formulated the.
new punt rule, the motive of that august :body was to-make '

college football more exciting for the fan. However, the
committee may have changed a great deal more of the
game than was originally intended.

The new rule says, in effect, that only backs and ends

may go downfield to cover a punt when the ball is snapped.’

The rest of the team must wait until the ball is actually
kicked.

 __ Essentially then emphasis will be placed on the punt
return. “Teams are spending more time on returns,” said
coach 1 Dave Hart recently. “Since-we have a chance now
to get that long runback too, we spent’ more time on it in
one practice than we did over the course of half of last
season.” - '

Concern develops when your 'team is the punting
team. The penalty for leaving too soon will be offsides. It
may not be an adequate deterrent. “The thing’s going to
be difficult,” Hart explained. “Everyone’s trying to beat

‘a it and not wait for the thud of the ball. We’re using a
' count, 1000-1, 1000-2. But I don’t know what will happen

§,_0n a high snap.’.’
Hart feels that there is going to be too much pressure

on the punting team. He thinks that coaches will» use the
alternatives open to them.

“I know I’d hate like anything to give Hal Busby of
UCLA———_a 9.3 man——the ball with an" open" field ahead of
him,”. Hart‘ said. “So I think there will be more punting
out—of-bounds, for one. There will be more quick kicks, for
another. ' ' . =

0' “Teams will be trying more field goals,” he continued.
“-At least you have a chance to score with them. And I
look for more punting on third down. With the receiving
team rushing only three or four men and dropping every-
one else back for the return, you can do things in punt
formation on’ third down. ‘ ‘

  
 

.,“It"lg'A_‘ives'A.’.,.uM_s a chance to  the ball.’,’ V  _

Pre-season soccer scrimmages are over. Tomorrow

I afternoon at 2:00 pm, the booters will be playing for keeps .

as they play host to Frostburg in the season's opener. The game

will be held at Kennard Field.

“We don’t know too much about them, but their coach is very

“Frostburg won only once last
year, but they lost three games
by only one goal to good teams
at the end of the season,” added
Bemis.

The soccermen beat Frost-
burg, 4-0, last season. “It would
be foolish,” explained Bemis, “to
make qjredictions based on last
year. They had a new coach and

they were unorganized, but they.

finished the season strong.”

In their final scrimmage last
Tuesday, the soccermen beat St.
Vincents, 4-0. “We won, 4-0, but
-we should have won 15-0,” ad-
mitted Bemis, “We missed a lot
of -shots.” ' -

Bemis used the scnimmage to
experiment. ‘He played Gary
Foertsch, an insterior -forward,
at right Wing, and‘ moved Terry
Wyler from wing int-o the in-
terior forward position, Foentsch
scored one of the four goals.

“We might start Foertsch at
wing if Bob Racunas can't play
said Bemis, still hopeful that
Racunas’ head injury is a min-
or one. “There’s still‘ a chance
that Racunas can play,” he con-
tinued. “He’ll take E.E.G. Tests
at Mt. Mercy.”

Right wing is the only unset-

’ optimistic,” said Bemis of his‘ first opponent.

mages this week, coach ‘Snyder
rated his team as average but
he also said, “The boys show
good hustle and will improve
quickly once the season starts.”
He cited defense as the team's
strong point and mentioned full-
backs Cliff Arber and D ave
Dowhar as two promising start-
ers.

The opening line-up will also
includehalfback Dave Taub and
left wings Dave DeEmido and
Ron Bugaj. Randy Dry will play
at right wing, and the goalie will
be Dick Pasternak with A1 Ever-
ett as second string. Lou Vita
will serve as a fill- in.

Snyder figures that tomor-
row's game will be one of the
tougher games of the season.
“We will use a zone defense
against Frostburg,” said Sny-
der, “but if they play a hard-
kicking game we will switch to
-man-to-man.” The fresh defeated
Frostburg last year, 5-2.

After Frostburg, ‘the fresh will
clash twice with Slippery Rock;
in a road game Oct. 3 and at

Slippery Rock team is the fresh-

(Quarterback Vacuum
Sweeps-up Bazylak

His collar open, his red tie hanging loose, Dave Hart
0 just stood there. He was dressed; ready to go home to an-
‘other late supper.

The‘ past week was a big one for him; he faced two
problems he had never run into before with the Panthers.

Early in the week, he made his most important decis-
‘ ion; a very hard one for him. Bob Bazylak, the 5-11, 180
pound senior and former high school All-American quarter-
back, was taken out of the number one quarterback position
he had held since August.

Two sophomores, Jeff Barr and Frank-
ie Gustine, moved up ri-nto the number two
signal calling spots. Bazylak was relegated
to the number two wingback slot behind
Joe McCain.

“It was a major decision I had to

LIES make,” Hart said as he looked down at the
cold ‘gray locker room floor. “It was a very distasteful situ-
ation, but my staff and I finally agreed that it had to be
done!’

The day was Monday. Hart had taken Baz aside, like
a coach would do anytime he wanted to talk things over
with his top quarterback. And he told him; coach to
player, man to man."

For Baz, it was a hard thing to take. It was something
like losing a part of your life, one which you tried to save
when five month old rumors said it was dead.

“Baz is caught in a vacuum. He’s a senior and every-
thing being equal I had to go with Barr and Gustine,” said
.Hart, shaking ‘his head like a guy who had lost his best
friend.

“Mechanically, he’s the best. And if we played to-
morrow, he’d start at quarterback,_but . . .” Hart stopped,
then he promised, ,“I’m going to give him, a trophy at the
end of the season, I swear.” _

Then an observer noted that playing at wingback,
Bazylak was in a position to catch passes, even a winning
touchdown throw. “Then I'd get him two troph1es,” quipped

Hart.

 

“I’m not saying we’re not
considering him at quarter-
back either. That’s one rea-
son we’re keeping him on of-
fense and not placing him on
defense as our defensive
cgaches asked,” he explain-
e . -

“We don't want him to
get completely away from

Baz will go through a teach-
ing period where we take a
certain individual and work
with him.” ,
Hart needs a back-up man
for McCain, who was used on
every scrimmage play be-
cause Gerry Rife’s physical
condition is still indefinite.
And Bazylak can play Wing-
back adequately. In Hart's
mind, Baz can do anything,
defense, wingback or quar-
terback; adequately.
Offensively, however, the
Panthers need a threat and
Barr could be it. “We need
a threat on the corners. Barr
runs a five ﬂat forty and

“Harrd decision . . .” ‘

sired,” informed Hart.

4 With Bar.r, the Jungle Cats can run a quarterback
', sweep. He has good hands, fine fakes, and a strong arm. He
will keep the opponents thinking.

Number two man Gustine can, in Hart's words, “lay
the ball out there.” He can put the ball on the mark. And
’ with the pro set, there may be more 80 yard pass plays to
'_Bobby Longo.

 With the Bazylak decision made, Hart felt relieved,
that is, until Wednesday. Then he learned the coaching
’ services of Howard Weyers would be lost for one to five
-5 ‘weeks.
‘i Weyers is plagued by a tumor in his gall bladder and
1 surgery must be performed. Hart plans to wait until after
-, the operation to see who will take charge of the defensive
. line, Weyers’ specialty.
, For those who watch practices at Trees Field, Weyers
,‘ is that little guy in shorts who runs behind an 11 man
’ sled; it seems for two miles daily. After each practice, he
inputs “his boys” on the sled and has them push it around
the field. And he’s right behind them, yelling and run-

With UCLA and Gary Be-
ban just one week away,
head coach Dave Hart ex-
pects to tone down practices
after yesterday’s scrim-
mage, the final one until
they play for keeps.

“Only a few more sessions
where we have contact Work
will be necessary,” Hart said.

“Our problem is still the
same. We’re a tremendously
young squad, and our sopho-
mores are still confused. It's
bad enough in our league to
start sophs, but this is a better
team than last year,” continued
Hart.

However, Hart is not being
as pessimistic as last «season.
He was disenchanted over last
Saturday’-s scrimmage, but he
blamed (1) the great amount of
varsity contact work, (2) the
beginning of school and the in-
evitable confusion, and (3) the
enthusiastic freshman team who
stopped the varsity quite a bit.

This has been a good practice
week for the Cats. The team’s
spirit is high. And the offense
with Jeff Barr and Frank Gus-
tine at quarterback appears
quick,” but the timing needs im-
provement,” Hart remarked.

Defensively, the secondary
stopped the freshman - U C L A

Jnexperienced Dibbley Lands   I

Pressure Position At Safety

- by Roy Jacobs
In this, Panther football’s Year of the Sophomore, still
another varsity rookie has seemingly nailed down a starting

berth.

This time, though, the player is not as well known as the other
sophs; nor is he filling in at a position easily filled by a sophomore.
As of now, however, New Castle’s D-ave Dibbley is holding down
the defensive safety spot opened by Bobby DT>’eI"~S g1‘adu'at10n-

Dibbley’s name wasn’t one of
those on the tips of everybody’s
tongues last year as one of the

 top men on the fres-hman squad
ﬁrecruited by Dave Hart.

This was largely due to the
fact that Dave was playing split
end, and with other pass catch-
ers like Joe McCain, Red Fedor-
chak, and Fred Tolhurst, there
wasn’t much ink left for him.
‘Later he was switched to tail-
back, only because John Sikina
and Denny Ferris were hurt.

Now though, more people are
taking notice of Dave, mainly
because he’s been playing along
side Mickey Depp at safety since
-the first‘ scrimmage at fall
camp. His reaction is no ‘differ-
ent than any of the other spohs.

 “I can’t believe it right now,”
said Dave. ‘‘I won’t believe it
until the Saturday we play UC-

~ LA. I can’t even get used to the
idea. of playing against UCLA.

“I played just regular at

camp. I didn't have any idea I"

was going to win the job.

“I got ,a couple breaks in the
scrimmage. Sometimes I’d do
something wrong and it Would
turn out right.”

After ‘playing only a little
linebacker in high school and
mostly halfback and end, Dave
wasn't too excited about making
the switch after last season.

“In the spring they tried eve-
rybody .on offense and defense,
and they decided I should play
defense. I wasn't happy in the,
beginning, but I'm real happy
now,” he added. .

“It was just that I hadn’t

played it for so long that I
wash’t used to it. Now I'm used
to it.” . .
With the way competition is
these days, What sophomore
wouldn’t be happy starting any-
where? Especially with such
depth at such a key position.

“It’s very unusual,” explained
Dibbley. “That’s why I wasn’t
planning on breaking in when I
went to camp. There were four
seniors ahead of me.”

Now that he’s there, Diblbley
is probably too busy thinking
about UCLA and the nine teams
following to Worry about his in-
experience.

“It’s gonna hurt for the first
couple games. You just can’t
cover mistakes up,” Dave con-
tinued. “It’ll take a couple of
games to get experience. You
can’t get around it—you need it.
Especially in the defensive back-
field where everything depends
on your reactions.

“The -only thing is to try and
make as few mistakes as possi-
ble.”

 

MICKEY DEPP
‘Helps New Safety

Dave's first big chance will
come next Saturday against UC-
LA. But he wasn’t too worried
about beingpicked on.

‘‘I don’t think that in college

ball they go towards” personnel
-too much. That’s more for the
pros. I think UCLA’l-1 stick to
their regular patterns.‘ They
won’t change too much.” Dib-
_bley wasn't even worried about
defensing All-American Gary
Beban.

“We worry about Hal Busby
and this sophomore Dave Nut-I
tall that’s supposed to be really
great. The ends are our prob-
lem. We don’t worry too much

about its business so far this
season. The unit is set -and it is
solid. I-t’ll keep the Panthers in
