II: Ringing Again  

. Those‘ bells are ringing again. They _swing._back and
forth «high over head pealing the celebration ofAthe.Holi-
,day ‘season. They spell out from ‘their high belfries that
- there is aipurpose behind the- Jingling hanclbells that street’
corner Santa Clauses swing or the timed cuckoo-cuckoo
of the clock in the merchant’s window. They reverberate
over the streetcarvrider who ‘throws a quick smilento his
habitual commuter friend; their tones over the. park where
‘ -the old man feeds those pigeons as the children Jump nimbly
about, eagerlyawaiting St. Nick’s- rosy visage.
Those bells are ringing again, unusually ear_ly—a month
in advance.‘ The store_s display their wares immediately
after the left—over.turkey is stashed in the refrigerator for
another night; the children rush to see jolly St. Nlck bef01‘e
the old ‘man has the ‘opportunity to dust the mothballs
from-his fadedred suit.. The radios blar_e the m'erry songs,
the spiritual ‘melodies, until that high climax when Crosby
sings “White Christmas.” '
« ._,‘.~‘F~ A But there is no holding back the excitement and cheers
' that this holiday season brings——a y€al"Se1‘-ms almost 100 long’
to wait before we remind ourselves again that there is “good-
will to all 'men.’’ ‘And, if the merchants must provide the first
reminder in our society, if the charity-Aseeking Santa Clauses
oircorners must remind the first donor of a inoral responsibility,
if the electric trains must serve as seasonal reminders _for the
ehild then they possibly also serve as “ii-rigatioir ditches"
which will carry the citizenry from thoughts of the minor as-
pects of the season into the more important implications ‘that
‘ the current spirit infers; , ' ,

The tumult of Christmas shopping, of supper prepara-
- tions expresses a_willingness on the part of our people -the '
world over to surge toward that greater hope that the
season presents. There is no opposition to starting the cele-'
bration early; there is no tiring of the hymns for they are
important expressions of the holiday. It provides the uplift
‘for us which a dreary year has‘ toned down.
A . And, while we eagerly cash those savings checks for
Y Tﬂgifts for members of the family, we feel a certain obliga-
Q;.~'-.—ﬁoﬁ._to toss ‘a few coins into the Salvation Army bucket-
? ; 7 or contribute a small CARE package for some one‘_over-
Q seas who might not celebrate asijoyfully as inhabitants of
'this Anation do. ' ‘ ' y
' As the current season makes us cognizant of the fact
7’"I.;that there is still hope‘ midst’ world trouble so does it
5‘ . make us paradoxically realize the difﬁculties throughout the

Health School Sends Special Team
To Find Typhoid Cause in Lancaster

Scientists Suspect
68 Farmers As
Typhoid Carriers

Seven microbe hunters of

Pitt» and the City Health de-

partment have joined to
search. for a carrier suspected
of causing an outbreak of pa-
ratyphoid fever in Lancaster
County. _ 7

Appointed by the State Health
Department, Dr. Horace M. Ge-
zon, associate Pitt professor of
epidemiology in the Graduate
School of Public Health met State
epidemic expert, Dr. William
Schrack to hunt the disease
source in the Lancaster area last
week-end.

_ Farmers Suspected

Especially suspected of carrying
the paratyphoid germ are about
68 farmers who supplied raw milk
to the Queen Dairy and 20 em-
ployees of the Queen Dairy. The
dairy closed voluntarily-last week
after" health authorities reported
the disease was traced to it.

Physicians warned that- closing
the dairy would not mean an im-

 mediate end~ to the epidemic. be-

cause the disease_ incubation pe-
riod is ten days. Queen Dairy has
been supplying ‘milk to custom-
ers from other dairies, also.
Three new cases of paratypoid
"were reported Monday in addition
to the ,twelve listed Sunday night.
Dr.S/chrack cited four out every.

’ ﬁve striken patients are under age

.ten."Three of the ‘patients are past
40.
Emergency Drug Purchased
For the ailing, Dr. Schrack

4 claimed that the State has issued

an emergency allotment to buy
Chloromycetin, a powerful won-
der drug believed to be the best
treatment there is for typhoid in-
fections. .»
Schrack said the State ex-
pects \t0 spend $20,000 for drug
V supplies to treat the sick be-
cause Lancaster county can’t af-
ford the supply cost.

Head» of the state’s Communic‘-
Disease Control Section
Schrack has been in -touch for
over a week with Pitt’s Dr. Wil-
‘liam McD. Hammond, epidemio-
logist. ‘* ’

Dr.- Hammond emphasized the

-fact that although paratyphoid is

similar totyphoid fever,'the type
of ‘paratyphoid fever concerned

- can be transmitted only from man
- to man. This eliminated the pos-

35,000 Receive Shots

At present vaccine. shots are
being administered to the 35,000
people who ordered Queen
Dairy’s milk. Doctors point out
that full protection requires three
shots spaced a week apart.

Both Dr. Hammon and Dr. Ge-
zon of Pitt were ‘summoned by
Dr. W. D. Schrack, when the need
for‘further medical investigators
became great last week.

As a precautionary measure
against further spread of the
paratyphoid -germ, three swim-
ming pools were closed. and a
USO dance canceled in the
stricken area.

 To Compensate
For Victory ‘Visits’

Damages of about $340 ‘for the destruction of property

of these students extended the‘ visit to Chatham. College,

vember. Payments to Carnegie Tech in the amount of $75.25

and Chatham College in the amount of $40 were authorized

for, the damages and
caused by Pitt students.

Dean of Men T. W. Biddle in-
dicated the damages at Carnegie
Tech include the ‘theft of a dress
form costing $18. He was able to
identify through a picture in the
Pittsburgh Press two Pitt stu-
dents, who were displaying the
dress form.

Penn Stole Damaged

Biddle also reported that at
least two groups of Pitt students
caused $225 worth of damage to
Penn State. Pitt students painted

1 the pylons at the entrance to the

campus from Route 322 causing
a damage of $125 and they threw
paint into the -Hetzel , Union,

their part in these two paint-

)Each student paid $25 toward
the cost of the damage, the $100

students were also placed on dis-‘

actions:

ciplinary probation.
A group of three Pitt students

were also detained at Penn State
the night of the Union and pylon
paintings, but State authorities
could ﬁx no responsibility on
these men. Since they are close
friends of the other boys, it is
presurnede they were related‘ to
the painting incidents, but no
evidence could be developed.
They were placed on warning.
The extensive painting by
West Virginia and Penn State
supporters on the Pitt campus
was also discussed. Mr. Biddle
reported an estimate from Build-
ing and Grounds that the cost of
sandblasting paint from lime-
stone walks and- granite walls
‘totals $878.41 against West Vir-
ginia, and costs of $724.72
against Penn State. Some of the"
expense, to corrert the damage

the students the option of going

ment to the University for the

Not Enough, Present To Vote.

Another MC Change ‘

By Al Donalson .
A situation in Men’s Council which a. proposed

constitutional amendment will rectify is proving

to be the proposal’s biggest obstacle.

Council has been plagued by. consistent ab-
senteeism thus far this year, so President Dimitri
Petro pushed a proposal which would change the
procedure used in nominating the at-large repre-
sentatives of Council. According to Petro, the
proposal would permit MC to have “better and
more active representation.” But because of absen-
teeism, the proposal has been tabled twice.

_ A section of Council's constitution stipulates
that any proposal to amend the constitution must
At last week’s meet-
ing, only 13 councilmen were present, and four of
them voted against the proposal.
Al|'Upperclassmen Run -

The proposal would permit upperclassmen from
any University school to run for 13 at—1a/rge posi-
tions in Council. In addition, another freshman
representative would be elected through the fresh-
man Men’s Conference program. Under the present
system, twelve at-large representatives are pro-

portionately elected according to enrollment from

The College, Business Administration, and Engin-
eering and «Mines.

Supporters of the measure have touted it high-

ly because they feel it wouldipermit the election
of councilmen who would show up for meetings.

Hypothetically, there may be nine capable and
“interested” candidates in Business Administration,

seated, while The College may have none. Under
the present system, only four of the nine could

be seated, while ﬁve incapable or uninterested .

College men would have to be sought to occupy
ﬁve seats. The proposed setup would allow a1l_of
the nine candidates from Business to occupy posi-
ttons. v
Opposition Stands Firm ~ «

Although the bill’s sponsors have offered a
strong case, the opposition has stood ﬁrm. Their

argument which has been refuted well by those _'

who favor the proposal is that “one school would.
be able to control Council” under the proposed
system. The bill’s supporters say that Men’s Coun-
cil is an organization which is interested in the
welfare of all University students rather than just
one school.’ Opponents of the measure should re-
member however, that each of the schools—-Co1-
lege, Business Administration and Engineering-3
will still be represented with. four class officers.
The presidents automatically
bers now. . T

This afternoon, Petro will try to get "the pro-
posal passed again by hustling his fellow council-
men awaytfrom the Commons Room Christmas"
party. Whether or not the at—large proposal is the
remedy, something must be done to eliminate ab-

Benny Goodman Tapes

“ Air Checks"

Jazz Records Rare Treat

By Bill Leslie
It was just a little over ﬁve
years ago that a long hidden tape
of the immortal Benny Goodman

Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert 01‘.
1937-38 was discovered and sub-
sequently released to the public
through Columbia Records. The
wild enthusiasm which greeted

this release was so fantastic that .

’a second volume of the 1937-38
Goodmanband has been com-
piled and recently issued by Co-
lumbia. 1

This new issue is not from -any
one particular concert, but is a
collection of “air checks” from
tapes of a c t u a l late - evening
broadcasts made when the band
was playing dance dates and club
engagements.‘ _

This is a rare treat, an out-
standing reproduction of the ﬁn-

’“the Goodman sound.” In all,
there are some forty sides by the
band, trio, and quartet on two
12" Columbia LP Albums (CL
4590 - CL 4591). The "excellent
liner _notes by the noted jazz
authority, Mr. George Avakian,
are more than sufficient in re-
vealing the band’s background.

Strong Drive Exhibited

. In the ﬁrst volume, Down South
Camp Meetin’, and Sometimes
I’m Happy, clearly exhibit the
strong drive and superb ensem-
ble balance which, when com-
bined, gave Goodman. the full
band sound. The frank simplicity
of Helen Ward’s vocal on You
Turned The Tables On Me, in
volume two is, in fact, sophistica-
tion in swing and is proven testi-

mony of the respect vocalist and
' band held for each other. This is
something which is all too ab-

we see the inimitable Goodman

style which was never achieved

before or since duplicated.

From Golden Era to Modern
From the golden era of swing

to the present day modern jazz‘

scene ‘is quite a hop, skip’ and
jump, but there are imany new
artists which the jazz" enthusiast
should be acquainted with.
' On this tour of the modern
jazz world three-. comparatively
new ‘female vocalists will be dis-
cussed. They are interpretive
stylists in their own right, and
‘will, in time," lend a highly crea-
tive talent to a rapidly progress-
ing jazz age.
Presently recording for the
Bethlehem, label is Miss Cris
Conners, formerly of the Stan
Kenton band, who has a new LP
on the market entitled, This Is
Christ-—A really notable effort
which should bring Chris to the
attention of jazz enthusists.ev-
erywhere. Supporting Chris nice-
ly in this album are Kai Wind-
ing, J. J. Johnson, Ralph Sharon,
and in particular, Herbie Mann,
who deﬁnitely adds something

extra ‘with some ﬁhe ﬂute work.‘
Debut of Helen Merrill ,
Continuing along the sameline,
namely the female vocalist, Em-
Arcy has released an LP mark-
ing the debut of Helen Merrill, a.
singer destined for huge success‘

in the jazz ﬁeld. A pleasant re-" ‘

lief from the “good 'shoutin”."
vocalists in existence today, Miss
Merrill possesses a background
rich in jazz experience stemming,
.from her association with such
greats as Earl Hines and Bud
Powell. Reminiscent of the early V
Peggy Lee “singing into the
mike” style, Helen displays some

of the ﬁnest vocal workthese

tired old ears have ever heard.“
Lastly comes Miss Teddi_Kin_g,_,
possibly more familiar because
of her work with the George
Shearing Quintet. Teddi has been
conﬁning her appearances to the
Boston area and is currently re-
cording under the Storyville la- ,
bel. This past summer- Teddi '
gained recognition at the New-
port Jazz Festival and established .
herself as a stylist and jazz great
of the future. Her most recent
effort is an LP, Storyville Pre-
sents Miss Teddi King. '

Tickets Unfair

Students Upheld‘

Dear Editor: ‘ -

Your editorial, “A Rallying
Point,” about the Dean of Men’s
Staff. putting the damper on the
Tuck Shop rally, did not come as
a surprise to this alumnus. More
signiﬁcant than the rally itself

was the University’s action in it.
During my student plays at Pitt,
I- could not help but be aware of
the intellectual listlessness of the

administration and faculty on "

matters of wide importance when
there were differences of opin-
ion. It appeared that no one
there had .a conviction to ex-
press himself when the subject
‘was anything more signiﬁcant

than the weather. Your editorial .

demonstrated that, in spite of
the ' unstimulating. atmosphere at
the University, Pitt students are
still capable of thinking for
themselves, and, just as import-
ant, expressing themselves.

Sincerely, ‘

The staff of Pitt News, ﬁght-

It is not the quarter that mat-

a case par excellence or dis-
crimination against one group of
people, practiced nowhere in the

these students second-class peo’-
ple that they have to pay more?

F-arrell’s McCoy Leads
  Big Ten Hoopsters-Here

By STEVE BUTCHOCK .
Blasted by the Duques'ne Dukes in the ﬁnals of the Steel
Bowl, the Blue and Gold hoopsters will attempt to recover
their winning ways when they host the Michigan State
Spartans at the Field House Saturday at 8:15 p.m.
Michigan obliged in the sea-6 .
son’s opener by losing to the Pan-
thers and Coach Bob Timmons is
hopeful that their Big Ten cousins
will do likewise. '
But the Spartans appear to have
»a better team than th_e Wolverines
‘did and are expected“ to give the
/Jungle Cats another tough test.
' Spartans Improved
The locals’ record is 3-1 for the
season which is one of the best
" starts by a Panther hoop team in
Several seasons. 6
Coach Forrest Anderson, who
guided the East Lansing cagers
to a 13-9 record last season,
will bring‘ a much improved
teain to the Steel City than he
had at his disposal last year.
The team has added height,
greater depth, and a year’s ex-
perience under the Anderson “fast
break” style of play which should
make them that much tougher. ‘
Farrell’s McCoy Here
A familiar name to local hard-
‘ Wood fans in the-visitors’ lineup

is a good rebonnder.

When McCoy was playing high
school ball for Farrell he hooked
up with a current Panther star—-

John Riser—who was then playing
for Washington High School in the
ﬁnals of the WPIAL‘ Class A
championship game.
McCoy vs. Riser
In that particular contest Mc-
Coy outscored Riser 25 to 17 and
the renewal of their court feud
should be an interesting feature
qi the Panther-Spartan tussle.
Coach Anderson thinks high-
ly of the Western Pennsylvania
hoop product. Anderson is of
the opinion that the agile Mc-
Coy has the potential of becom-
ing the greatest player in State’s
_history although his scoring did
drop off somewhat last season.
Another senior standout wearing
the colors of the midwestern
school is center Duane Peterson
of Elkhart, Indiana.
Peterson at Center

Peterson towers 6-6 and has a‘

sharp eye for the hoop. Last sea-
son Peterson had the best shoot-
ingipercentage on the team as he
hit 107 out of 229 for 46 per cent.
Peterson played his best game
last season when the Spartans
trounced Indiana, outscoring
H o o s i e r All -\American Don

Schlundt by four points, 30-26.

After the Spartan game the
Timmonsmen will travel to Johns-

The Panther freshmen ho

To date, the Cubs have a 1-1
record, having trounced the West-

in their last outing. _

In ‘preparing ‘for the coming
game, Peterson said of the Duke
frosh, “I saw them play one gam_e.
They’re not too tall but are fast
and are good set shots.

Doin" What
Comes, Naturally

By GENE AROMATORIO
Sports Editor

  

I ‘Paul  coach. of the Cleveland Browns, has been

_quoted as saying, “To win is not the most important thing; '

its the only thing.” ‘ _

Pitt sports seemto be doing the “only thing” most of
‘the time so far this year. The football team fulﬁlled the
most optimistic expectations by winning seven of ten and
landing in the Sugar Bowl. .

Numbered, among the accomplishments for John Michelo-
sen’s gridders are victories o.ver VVest Virginia and Penn State,
thus giving the Panthers possession of the Coal Scuttle.

After the Penn State win the Panthers received the Sugar Bowl
bid——ﬁrst Bowl appearance for Pitt since 1938. Then with everyone
calming down and turning attention to basketball before the big
New’Year’s classic, the Pitt footballers were awarded the Lambert
trophy—ﬁrst time since 1938—which goes to the top team in the east.

' The Panthers have also been installed as the eleventh top team
in the country. .Not a bad jump from last year‘s obscurity ranking.
Summed up, the above-listed awards heaped onto the grid-
s , ders spell one word—success. '

Moving over to the soccer team, now in its second year of com-
petition, it posted an impressive record against some of the top soccer
teams in. the country. In the season ﬁnale against the Penn State

V _booters, conceded to be the country’s top soccer team, the Panthers

were right on the Staters’ heels, 4-3, until the closing minutes when
they ﬁnally succumbed, 6-3. A more than ﬁne showing forla second
year performance we’d say. 

vThe’ cross-country team didn’t’ fare too poorly this season either.
All they did was win all but one meet and top the season off'by
winning the IC4A’s in New York-——the ﬁrst time a Pitt team has
ever copped that title. ’ p ‘

Another added honor tossed in the direction of‘ the runners
came two weeks ago when the AAU nominated Arnie Sowell
for the Sullivan award. ‘This award is annually given to the
athlete whom the AAU committee feels best ﬁts their ideas and
ideals of an amateur.
 With the conclusion of football, soccer, and cross-country, Pitt

basketball moved into the spotlight and got off to a goodstart by
winning the_ ﬁrst two games and then copping the ﬁrst tilt in the
‘ Steel Bow1.. Though the Timmonsmen got a _real stgmping from
Duquesne in the final; this shouldn’t stop them/from having their
best season in ‘many a year. 1
One thing we noticed about the Panther loss to the Dukes; the

ﬁrst fans to cheer when we upset Michigan and won three in a row
were the ﬁrst, ones to holler when we lost to the Dukes. It’s funny.

Yogis Pick Sugar Bowl Queen
To Reign At New Year Classic P

Our ever-present Pitt News,Yogis returnedto Pittsburgh
temporarily yesterday from their New Orleans encampment
to select a Pitt coed as Sugar Bowl Queen. _

The swamis did not require their cracked crystal
balls nor their warped ouija ° N

the Pitt beauties.

Michelosen. _

Salk Vaccine Saves

City Hospital Funds

An $59,000 decrease in the budget of Municipal Hos-
pital, Pittsburgh polio center, is being put into effect partly
as a result of the Salk vaccine.

Because a drop in the number of polio cases in the

-Pittsburgh area is expected in 1956 due to the vaccine’s

effectiveness, the allocation for extra help at the hospital to
care for polio victims is- being cut in half to $40,000.

The city also has hopes of re-"

ducing the food bill at Municipal
by $13,000 and the drug costs by
$3,000, in 1956.

Cuts Total 11%

‘ These cuts total an eleven .per
cent decrease in the overall budget
of thi hospital.

Deputy Health” Officer Arthur
H. Baker said that the city, in
"making the cutback, was “bank-
ing on a decrease in polio pa-
tients next year, as more and
more children are immunized.

“On the basis of the immuniza-
tion which the vaccine has provid-

, ed this summer,” he said, “we cer-

tainly ought to have a precipitous
drop inpolio next year.”
Funds Go To Leech Farm
Some of the money saved

through the reduced costs of Mu-

nicipal hospital will be allocated
to the City's Tuberculosis Hospital
at Leech Farm. ‘

An increase of $37,372 will
provide $7,200 for a new physi-
cian and. the rest for part-time
nurses, cleaners, and utility
workers to fill in during the va-
cations of the regular main-
tenance staff.

Mayor -David L. Lawrence sub-
mitted to City Council the "new
Health’ Department budget which

D Eisenhower Calls ‘ Conference

ducators

President Speaks
To 1300 Delegates
At Opening Session

By ESTHER MISHELEVICH
I Dr. George W. Hoffman, di-
rector of the Johnstown Cen-
ter, termed the White House
Conference on Education,

ezwhich he attended early this

month, a “great personal ex-
perience.” _ .-
Dr. Hoffman was one of the
1800 delegates representing the
states and territories of the United
States who attended the special
conference called by‘ President
Dwight D. Eisenhower. Delegates,
‘educators and representatives of
labor, parent—teachers associations,
and interested groups met to dis-
cuss the nation’s education prob-
lems.

President Eisenhower addressed

‘the opening session of the confer—'

-ence, Nov. 28, by means of a ﬁlm-
ed message. Vice President Rich-
ard M. Nixon welcomed the dele-
"gates. In the following three days,
through Dec. '1, participants di-
_\gided into conference sessions to
‘discuss the following six points:

.(1) What should our schools
accomplish? ,(2) How can we
organize our school system more
efficiently and economically? (3)
What are our school building
needs? (4) AHow _ can we get
enough good teachers—and keep
them? (5) How can we ﬁnance
-our schools (build and operate
them)? (6) How can we main-
tain public interest in educa-
tion? , '
Hoffman chaired the conference
group that discussed the need for

teachers. Altogether, there were
166 round table discussion groups.
These were later consolidated into
several smaller groups.
Final Report Prepared
Finally, remaining representa-
tives prepared a ﬁnal report for
the President. Dr. Hoffman said
that every delegate had an po-
portunity to discuss and express
his views on each problem.
Concerning federal aid to edu-
cation, one of. the general is-
sues discussed, 75% of those at
the conference felt that the gov-

struction of schools, while one-
half of them believed the gov-
ernment should help support the
operation of schools. '

Depend on State,
Hoffman Reports

will depend on what the states
decide to do, Dr. Hoffman report-
ed. He said that each delegate was
asked to return to his state with
the information and the views
which were presented in the vari-
ous discussions. Also, similar con-
ferences were encouraged on a
state level.
Pa. to Schedule Meets

Pennsylvania, represented at the
conference by 86 delegates, will
probably ‘hold regional confer-
ences concerning education soon,
the Johnstown Center director
stated. He, himself, has been ask-
ed to address civic groups in the
state about the conference de-
cisions. '

This national conference had
the largest newspaper coverage
of any of its kind, Dr. Hoffman
noted. Delegates expressed a de-
sire for more such meetings and
recommended that another one
be held within the next ﬁve

Dr._ Hoffman stated that the
main value of this gathering lies
in informing the people of the
country about the problems of
education. “These problems have
to be faced, and such a confer-
ence focuses nationwide attention
on them.”VIn this-‘ way, he added,
in effect, it will instigate more
local action. "‘
