No Power Crisis In Sig

University
Assured

Fuel Supply

There is very little possibility
that school will be closed on ac-
count of the coal shortage.

Dr. John Weber, secretary of the
University, told the News that there
is '11" three t~o‘four week‘ supply of
coal in the stock pile of the Belle-
field boiler plant, which heats all
the school buildings, Mellon In-
stitute, and Carnegie Institute.

Even if the current shortage of
coal for industrial consumers is
prolonged, Dr. Weber believes enough
coal to keep the fires burning can
be bought on the open market.

No Cut llere

Possibilities that an electric
power cut for industry might be
extended to classrooms were snuffed
out by the Duquesne Light Company.

The power company announced
last week that it would have to
reduce electric power to district
firms because the coal strike had
closed the mines which supply it.

But the contemplated power cut
was postponed until some time
this week pending further analysis
of the situation by the electric
company.

School Stays Open
In any case, a Mr. Briggs of
Duquesne Light informed the News
laughingly (probably remembering
his own class-cutting days) that
the University is way, way down
on the list of big consumers sched-
uled for power cuts in case the

situation becomes drastic.

Barring earthquakes, revolutions,
or typhoid in the drinking fountains,
the school doors will be open for
business as usual after the mid-
year recess.

Recent news reports indicate
that the rebelling coal miners may
return to the fold and resume work.
If they do, all hopes of an enforced
holiday, never too strong, would
be completely deflated.

All’s Quiet on Phi Kap Front;

By BOB TIIOMAS

For the past week Phi Kappa
cars-have been rolling silently into
the Phi Kap driveway at 152 N.
Dithridge St. over an improved sur-
face of sand slag.

It completelycovers the old gravel
auto trail and parking lot in the rear
of the house.

Laid down by the fraternity act-
ives as an answer to Common Pleas
Court Judge A. Marshall Thomp-
son's ruling that the Phi Kaps
should give their lot a "smooth
firm” resurfacing job, the present
job is deemed merely temporary.

Quiet Reigns

According to Phi Kap "contrac-
tors,” the frat men spread three
truck loads of the slag over the
lot. This five-ton lot submerges
the former noisy gravel under a
one inch blanket of silence.

Sometime in the near future, the
Phi Kaps expect to "black top”
the lot to further comply with Judge
Thompson's order.

The five tons of slag Just about
quiets this phase of the Phi Kappa
troubles. The fraternity had been
involved in a three -month court
battle with neighbors Henry K.

Soft Pedal Put on Parking Lot

Kirk—Patrick and W. Hayden Wilson
over the legality of the parking lot
in the rear of the Phi Kap house.
Ki;-k—Parrick and Wilson live in the
Hampton Hall Apartments immedi-
ately next door to the fraternity
house.

Frat Wins Out

Taken into court on Sept. 28, the
frat sought to prove that the park-
ing lot was permissible under city
laws. With Attorney Robert A. Jar-
vis and twelve other Phi Kap
lawyers backing them, the frat also
sought to disprove neighbor's
charges that petting and drinking
went on in the lot.

After a series of hearings, Judge
Thompson delivered a decision on
Jan. 3 that absolved themen of the
"necking charges” and allowed the
lot to remain if given a "smooth,
firm” resurfacing job.

During and before the start of
the court fight, the driveway running
between the Phi Kap house and
Hampton Hall became a legal no-
man's land. Cars speeding into the
drive ‘hit the gravel like a "thunder-
clap,” according to Wilson, allow-

ing him no sleep "for over a year."

Commendations at a‘ later date. For
the past week, Roy Nelson has con-
ferred with Edwin J. McIntosh, MC
advisor, and with the Dean of Men
on the subject of the lounge.

Mr. Mclntosh has expressed his
regret at the apparent feud develop-
ing between Men's Council and the
band over the use of 817. There is
no need for conflict, according to
Mr. McIntosh, since the use of
movable furniture in the lounge
would enable it to be used by the
band for rehearsals.

SECOND SEMESTER NEWS ,

l'0da.V’s News is the last issue
for the fall semester. The news
deadline for next semester's first
issue, which will be out Feb. 14.
has been set at 12 noon on Feb.

to notices for the Bulletin Box at
the Student Desk.

 

Senior Graduation Plans

When 989 seniors leave Pitt for
good this Feb. 3, the remaining
students will leave for a ten day
vacation.

Midsemester commencement will
be held Friday, Feb. 3 at 2:30 p.m.
at the Syria Mosque. At that time,
acting in his official capacity,
Chancellor Rufus Fitzgerald will
confer the degrees on the graduating
seniors.

Dr. Clifford Barbour, moderator
of the Presbyterian Church will
be the speaker. Dr. Barbour, a
graduate of the University, holds
a _Ph.D. from the University of
Edinburgh, LL.D. from Waynesburg,
and D.D. from Maryville.

AQPf0Xlmately 989 seniors will
receive diplomas, according to E.A.
Batchelder, assistant registrar. Of
tl1<?Se 989, the following will" re-
ceive degrees from the various
schools:

The College", 296; Engineering,

Thrifty Scots
To Squander
Word Hoard

Scotchmen have long been said
to be a wee bit sparing with their
spending. That they are not spar-
ing with their words will be
proved by two doughty Scots from
the "auld" country who will mix
words with two of Pitt's debaters
on Feb. 22.

Whether or not the Scots, David
D.T.Reid andMalcolm David Web-
ster, will Wear kilts and tartans
has_ not been revealed as yet. It
is rumored, however, that the
University representatives, Frank-
lin Blackstone and John David
Rhodes, are planning something
to offset the sex appeal of the
Highlanders’ bare knees in case
they do.

At any rate the local boys can
say they've had their one and
only Highland fling after the
forensic joust. With so many Da-
vids in evidence, it’s hard to
tell who will be the giant killer.

Reid is from the University of
Glasgow and Webster attends the
University of Edinburgh.

After a heated discussion,
Student Congress last night

voted again to table the motion , ‘,1

that would prevent a student
from belonging to both Congress
and Men's Council, aside from
the regular Council representa-

tives provided for in the SC ’

constitution. _
he 7-6 balloting put the con-

troversial motion in the “no vote”
category for the second time since
it was originally tabled at the Jan.
9 meeting. I‘

When the motion was made by
Dick Campbell, senior represent-
ative, to take the “two-job” ques-
tion off the table and put it to a
vote, sentiment in Congress was
almost equally divided as to wheth-
er Congress should take action or
wait until Men's Council had decid-
ed the question in their own ses-
sion.

Campbell Objects

During the discussion, Campbell
commented, "I do not see why We
have to wait till Men's Council
gets through with it.” .

In support of Campbell, D1<§l=
Kovar, junior representative, said
that Congress shouldn't “depend
on another organization to do wl.i,at
we ought to carry out ourselves.’

Flashbacks
By LARRY HERLICK
19 Years Ago

Stone-setters on the top floors
of the Cathedral of Learning were
somewhat‘ distracted ffom their
work one clear afternoon by an air-
V plane which came alarmingly close.
The playful pilot played “watch
me go around the pylon” for about
two minutes. ACCording‘tO the_Pi_tt
Weekly’s reporter, he came within
a hundred feet of the ground.

A foolproof system of checking
absences was in use. One white
absence slip, the professor would
write the names of all absent per-
sons. To eliminate the danger of
any absentee escaping the just
penalty due him in case the prof
lost the absence slip, all slips
were dropped into large, brass-
bound ‘boxes which stood in the
hall. These were emptied at the
end of each day and the absence
recorded.

The Pitt band moved into the
Cathedral from a shack on Frick
acres where they had been rehears-
ing. The old rehearsal room, which
had been a stable, was torn down.
One of the main objections to the
old rehearsal room’, shack, shanty
or whatever you'd like to call it,
was the large hole in the roof
through which a workman on the
top floor of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing mayhave dropped a solid chunk
of masonry. ’ i

At an estimated cost of $600, a
50-foot American" Elm tree was
hauled from Mercer, Pa., to grace
the Bigelow Boulevard entrance to
the Cathedral. A glance through
the dirtcovered windows of room
817 failed to reveal any 70 year
old trees. This project seemed to
be an effort to compete with Har-
vard’s elms, according to the Pitt
Weekly’s_ story.

Pitt Newe News Editor 4‘

All the talk about the building campaign has centered around
student centers and field houses ‘and the like. No one has said
anything about where the students who will enjoy these new build-

ings are to park their cars.

It seems like an important question 'to us. Oakland, we are

sure, is not going to have any more
parking space in the future than it
has now. However, no one seems
to be interested enough, from what
we have seen, to even bring the
question to the attention of the
powers that be. '

At least two universities that
we know of are planning the con-
struction of parking garages for

student use. Seems like a pretty -

good idea.

Something we've wondered since
freshman days is why the observa‘--
tion deck atop the Cathedral has
never been opened. There certainly
must be a fine view from the top
of this long lean structure. For we
all know there may be no observa-
tion deck on the roof at all. Or
maybe Men’s Council has it sewed
up as an alternate for their lounge,
in case the icontroversey on the
eighth floor loafery gets too hot.

Speaking of Men's Council,
they'll soon begin the second act
of their farce entitled, "Don’t

Mistake Freshmen for‘People,” or
"How to Look Asinine by One
Easy Application” (cf) the head,
that is). ' ,

How to explain” this one is be-
yond us. It happened after the re-
cent accidental imprisonment of
Messrs. Lohmeyer and Saalbach
in the eighth floor latrine. As you
remember, they removed the glass
from the door in order to gain free-
While the glass was still
out of the door, a chap hurried up
to the men’s room and tried to open
the door.

Finding it locked, he walked de-
jectedly. away, completely disre-
garding the five-by-three foot hole

where the glass had been. Con-
vention can be an uncomfortable
thing. i

- Politicians, we" have always
known, avoid agreeing on anything ,
as muchas possible. We didn’t
know the stigma extended to our
own Poli Sci department. But we
were told that three Poli Sci pro-
fessors couldn’t agree to the ans-
wers on 35 out of 65 questions on
‘a recent multiple-choice Poli Sci 1
major.

Wonder what the Panther staff is
brewing in that dingy office of
theirs? ‘The boys aren’t talking
much these days. It’s probably not
worth wondering about.'fWho,knows,
though maybe ‘the next mag will be

a quarter’s worth. That would ‘be '

setting a dangerous precedent.

The publication really worth
buying is, it seems tb us, a little
‘neglected. Owl sales cover only

are on the road to a fine-feathered

Coeds Unaffected
Editor, \
Pitt News -

In regard to your reference to
WSGA in the editorial of Tuesday,
January 17th, entitled "Quit Two-
Timing,” we believe that you have
been misinformed. ‘

There is no. need for WSGA to
pass any legislation which would
prevent a woman from running, for
or holding two major positions.
No need, because the point scale
system, which has been in exist-
ence for many years, has served
just this purpose.

This system, through the clear-
ing house conducted by Senior
Court of WSGA, prevents a woman
from accepting nominations for
more than one majorposition, and
in addition, limits the nominations
she may accept for minor posts.

"WSGA‘does not permit '_‘dual-
office" holding. It is true that the
president and vice-president of
WSGA serve on more than one major
committee, but only by virtue of
their respective offices. The
offices, then, are inseparable; if
either of these two women resigns
from one, she automatically re signs
from the other. A

As forithe "resigning rut,” WSGA
stands upon its record. We have
had few, if any, resignations which
have been a ‘result of dual office
holding.

Speaking specifically on dual
office holders, the president of

That Tuck Shop ‘Air

Editor, .
Pitt News

This talk about the Student Union
is great. If we get one, no doubt
the class of ’65 will really enjoy
it. But rightnow it seems like a
low priority project compared with
what we have.'Of course I’m talk-
ing about the Tuck Shop and the
fetid atmosphere we breathe, re-
breathe, and rebreathe.

We ‘don’t.have to spend our free
hours in the‘ Tuck Shop, .true. But
where else can you go for a cigar-
ette. and a quick coke? It gets
pretty crowded around,12:30. The
density of people is 217.7 per
square foot. At this rate the heat
gets pretty oppressive. Some of
the kids bring their own fresh air
in paper bags, but this is only
good for about 20 minutes. The
others, remembering their trips to
the zoo, know ‘that in a half hour
or so they will become accustomed
to it. 1

There is no air-conditioning in
the Tuck Shop. The custodian of
building and grounds maintains
that the gratings behind the seats
were intended to ventilate the
place, but their purpose is frus-
trated by the students who pile
their coats on top.‘The fallacy of
this is apparent in thewarm wea-
ther when there are no coats and
the air is as foul as ever.

Air-conditioning is expensive
and perhaps it wouldn't be suit-
able. But there must be some way

to filter the air. Not only would it"

be more pleasant and ‘healthful, it
might even make the sandwiches
taste fresh. ‘Those poor things

is thoroughly behind the idea; but
from another student organization--
the band which rehearses in 817.
The band has a right_ to gripe, or,
that is to say, thinks it has a right
to gripe. *
Inthree"RememberUs”columns,
Allen Bierman, speaking as a band
member, has presented the band's
side of the argument. It's a con-
vincing argument but stems from a
misunderstanding_ of the facts,
rather than from the facts them-
selves.
Review the Case
* Bierman, in his columns, brought
up three points‘. 1) the band has
been kicked around from one inade-
quate rehearsal room to another"
since the days 19 years agowhen
a shack housed the band (ste
Flashback’s), 2) any other room on
the eighth floor would be suitable
or more suitable, for a recreational
lounge, and 3) the band for "all its
effort is not recognized by students
affected with "carditis” as’ it
should be. i '
Let’s take a look at each of
these arguments. The first column
presented a thorough resume of the
band's travels during the last three
years. Starting at the accoustically
impossible Logan Armory in 1947,
it traveled last year to the basket-
ball court in the Stadium where it
"battled echoes and basketball
players.”
Now they rehearse in 817, which
is "sound-proof and convenient
though a bit crowded." To place,
the band in a lesser room would be
as Bierman contends, a crime.
‘Bierman wrote, however, under the
assumption that the establishing of
the lounge would mean just that-
the band's returning to its battles
against bad accoustics, echoes,
and ‘basketball players.
Three's a Crowd
Suchis not the case. The Panther
Room, in addition to housing the
band rehearsals, also harbors the
music appreciation classes. (See
story page 1.) Council believes
that with these classes transfer-
red, the room could be used as
both_a lounge and as a band re-
hearsal room.
His third point, a request for
more appreciation, is well taken.

Visitors Praise

In the words of Al Payne, co-
executive, the 1950 edition of Re-
ligion-in-Life Week accomplished’
on the Dirt campus "a spiritual
celebration, an intellectual per-
spective, and a religious recommit-
ment."

And most of the visiting leaders
and committee workers,meeting for
an evaluating session last Thurs-
day, concurred with Mr. Payne's
appraisal and added their own words
to the compliments on the program

Dr. Richard McKinney’ spoke for
all twelve visitors when he said
that it was a source of gratification
to view the cooperation and religious
interestexisting on the Pittcampus.
He especially commended the hos-
pitality of the administration and
faculty. -

Miss Frances Dysinger remarked
that there is a distinct atmosphere
of culture and courtesy here, an
unusual thing on a campus this
size. ‘

Health Plan

Renewed

A program of insurance covering
everything from hospital and phys-

ician’s care to dentistry will be
offered to students at mid-term
registration.

, Underwritten by the Mutual Bene-
fit Health 8: Accident Association,
the insurance will cost $6.20 for
coverage up to an aggregate of
$500. The plan is open to all un-
dergraduates carrying twelve or
more credits and to graduate stu-
dents with a minimum of nine.

Company officials warn, how-

  

 

New Science

Course Added

Beginning this summer, the bac-
teriology department will offer a
special course in Bacteriology for
Liberal Arts students.

The course, two semesters, two
credits, will have no pre-requisite
and no laboratory work. It will con-
sist of lectures and class demon-
strations on the subject "Micro-
biology and Man.” ,,

The department feels that bac-
teriology is of use in so many dif-
ferent fields that even Liberal
Arts students should have the op-
portunity tolearn some of the basic
facts.

Listed as bacteriology l and 2,
it will cover the same material as
the regular general course, but it
will keep to the level of the stu-
dents’ previous training.

Movies, slides, and other visual
aids will be used to explain such
subjects as "What Bacteria Are",
"The Role That Bacteria Play in
iAgriculture”, and the "Utilization
of Bacteria in Industry".

for such a course here and was
largely responsible in getting the
class started this Semesten.

This course, according to Mayer,
is a development ofthe Great Books
idea promoted by the University of
Chicago and gaining popularity
throughout the country.

Clubs Organized

With the aim of acquainting more
people with the valuable lessons
in fine literature, several Great
Books Clubs have been organized
where.‘ it is not unusual fora cab
driver to discuss the Iliad with
school teachers.

Several students who were mee.

for the first expressed a delighted
reaction. "They were all surprised
to find the Bible was so interest-
ing,” explained Mr. Mayer.

a large percentage of his litera-

references to biblical material in

for "Winken, Blinken, and Nod,"
it is easy to sympathize with Mr.
Mayer.
"Students Work Good

But the work in Eng. 119 has
not been aimed entirely at the un-

pre-theological students of dif-

In years past dances have fea-
tured beauty contests for queens,

Heart Hop sponsors a handsome
contest for the male escorts attend-
ing "Blossom Time,” Feb. 17 in
the Schenley Hotel.

Marcia Swartz, chairman of the
dance, announced that any girl
going, to Heart Hop may, if she

‘wishes, submit a photo of the es-

cort she will take. These photos
will be judged by the committee
and the night of the dance a "Blos-

The fellow and his date will re-
ceive gifts in honor of the occasion.

Heart Hop is an annual dance
sponsored by all of the women’s
classes on campus. The theme of
the affair is that the girls invite
the boys. Of course this is not
compulsory; the boy may ask the
girl, but traditionally the rule is
reversed. '

Benny Benack and his orchestra
will play for the dance and a spec-
ial intermission program of square
dancing is being planned. Sid Mc-.
Nutt, director of folk dancing for
the Pittsburgh Y organizations,
will ca-ll and lead the intermission
session.

Since there are only 300 tickets
on sale for the tut-nabour, the com-
mittee urges early purchase of
of,.tickets._Tickets are 332,50 per
couple and may be purchased at
the Student Desk or from any mem-
ber of the committee. -

The dance is informal and will
keep the valentine, love-in-bloom
theme in entertainment and decora-

"tions.

Keeping the turnabout theme, the
committee has planned to give the
girls’ excorts boutonnieres as they
enter. No doubt this will be the
first time that flowers of any type
were presented at a Pitt dance.

Lone exception to the football
role is Dodo Canterna who coaches
the team and schedules the games.
Dodo, the brains among the brawn,
was a regular for four years under
Doc Carlson and holds the Pitt re-
cord for points scored in one game

with 37.

He is still working onihis degree
here, having had his schooling in-
terrupted when he took time out to
last

play pro fe ssional baseball

year.

Amazing Potentials

Miembers of the team that played
football this fall are Jimmy Joe
Robinson, Lindy Lauro, Carl De-
Pasqua, Earl Sumpter, Ralph Short,
Bobby Lee, and Bob Plotz. Tony
Razzano, ;now on the wrestling.
squad, and Leo Skladany, who played
pro ball with the Philadelphia Eagles
this season, round out the squad.
Both played on the ’48 Panther

\

squad.

If things get too bad, Canterna
can call for the Figure Eight with
Plotz, Lee, De Pasqua, Short, and
Robinson blocking out the opposing
players while Razzano puts a half-
nelsonon the referee. Skladany, the
strong boy, can then pick up Sum-
pter and the ball and toss them

through the hoop.

In organizing a team this year,‘
the Gridders are carrying on an old
Pitt tradition. Their football repu-
tation has alwaysmade them a good
drawing card and they have been.

able to win their share of games.

Lee Paces Pack '

Though Canterna was a scoring

‘ star under Carlson, Lee has been
leading the Gridders in getting the
ball into the basket. But as Lauro
points out it is hard to pick out an

vtstanding player.

Oddly enough, the footballer who
the
Gridders isn't even on the team._
When Lou Melilld broke a leg, the
boys played a benefit game in his
home town and turned the receipts

over to Lou.

Act Two of the Pitt-Penn State basketball production, sched-
uled for presentation at the Stadium tomorrow night at 8:15,is not
slated to be a repeat performance of the first act. ._
Doc Carlson led his performers through the freeze act during. -

the first lialf against the Lions on
Saturday at State College, with the
result that Pitt trailed 5-0 at inter-
mission.

The Panthers mixed it up with
their goon-sized opponents in the
second half, but came off on the
short end of a 34-21 score.

"We'll play them a different kind
of game tomorrow," said Carlson
when queried on his strategy for
Penn State's return engagement.
No deep freeze tactics are con-
templated,according to the Panther
coach.

"We may even win this time.”

The preliminary to the Pitt-Penn
State contest shapes up as a real
thriller. Pitt's crack freshmen team
‘ meets the undefeated Pitt Gridders
at 6:45. _

Musical Accompaniment

In the frigid first half Saturday,
the Panthers tried only four shots,
maintaining possession of the ball
the majority of the time to the ac-
companiment of organ music and
community singing.

There was no scoring by either
side for 19 minutes and 35 seconds.
Penn State got the opening jump
with Marty Costa driving under the
hoop for a layup. Costa missed the
shot, but was fouled in the process
and awarded two free throws.

Poor Shooting _
The 6-6 center made good on his
first shot, and then followed up the

ﬁiﬁmmmn
With a Cause ,

By IIYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

If a list had to be made of

the past semester's outstanding

sports names, it would probably include such persons as Nick

Bolkovac, Bernie Barkouskie, George

McCrossin, and L. Jean

Younginger.

The last named personage, built
along different, though no less im-_
pressive, lines than Bolkovac
& Co., has made a name for her-
self as president of the Women’s
Athletic Association. L; Jean is
the John L. of feminine sports.

If women's sports ever become
a big thing at Pitt, L. Jean will

have been one of the founding.
fathers -- or rather, mothers. At
present she has some 35 coeds

under her wing, and they are striv-
ing to make the females around this

place sports-minded.
Di re. News
This may come as unpleasant

news to those men who want no

part of athletic women. To such a
viewpoint Miss Younginger retorts,
“Have you ever seen some of our
members?” I personally can't say
that I have, but it is apparent that
some first hand reporting work is
immediately necessary.

And I already have offers from
six of our sports reporters to under-
take the labor. '

Andy Schurman, our intramural
man, reports that Intramural Direc-
tor Leo C.Bemis once tried to start
a mixed badminton tournament b'e-
tween coeds and men. The women
were all for it, but the men, for

.n_

 

some reason, balked.

Although L. Jean knows nothing
about that venture, she says her
her organization will go on record
as supporting mixed athletics. Per-
haps it would help bring more wo-

men members into the fold -— or
should I say pleat?

Of course, badminton is not the
only sport the girls play. They are
equally adept in basketball, volley-
ball, softball, archery, pingpong,
and almost anything short of bar
bell lifting.

The first time I tried to contact
Miss Younginger I was told by her
mother that she would not be home
that evening because she was ref-
ereeirﬁg a basketball“ game. Now

‘this is the sort of answer you ex-

pect when you are calling Monk
Ketchell or Nick Jacobs.

But evidently men no longer have
a monopoly on sports. In fact, we
may as well give up on the theory
that it’s a man’s world.

Pill Rollers’ Field Goal
Scarcity Fouls Up Medics

The Pharmacy Sophomores almost became the first basketball
team in intramural history to win a game without scoring a field

goal.

Playing a rival Professional
League entry, the Med Sophs, at
Trees Gym last Wednesday, the
Pill Rollers played three-fourths of
the game before sinking their first
two-pointer of the game.

Their amazing accuracy at the
foul line, however, accounted for
the win, 30-27.

As it was, it took two overtime
periods to determine the victor.
According to intramural rules, a tie
at the end of the game-necessitates
a «sudden-death playoff. In this
period the first team to go ahead by
two points, is declared the winner.

The game was tied at 26-26 at

'the end of the regulation playing

time, due chiefly to the efforts of
Ken Smith. Out of the Pill Rollers’
30 markers, Smith ‘had 20.

Most of Smith’s points were gar-
nered via the foulroute. In the first
half,,he tallied 7out of '7 free shots,
and ended with an astounding total
of 12 fouls out of 13 chances.

Smith was also credited with
three ofhis team’s four field goals,
all made in the crucial fourth quar-
ter. The remaining score from the
floor was in the overtime period
when Al Marcatali pushed in the
winning two points.

Phi Delts Too Tall

Phi Delta Theta defeateda small
Alpha Phi Delta squad, 41-24, in a
contest played at Trees gym Thurs-
day night. “ _

It was evident from the opening
Whistle that APD was outclassed
by a taller and more experienced
PhiDelt five. PhiDelt took a 20-11
first half lead and was never in
difficulty.

Delta Sigs Win

The Delta Sigs displayed an out-
standing defense Friday night while

Conklin Still
Undefeated

Doc Conklin racked up victory
No. 5 Saturday at the Stadium as
Coach Rex Peery’s wrestlers bowed
to Kent State, 17-11..

The undefeated Conklin will get
his next test Saturday when the
grapplers invade State College for
a dual meet. Bill Santell, the Lions
undefeated 165 pounder will be
"Conklin’s next opponent.

Coach Charley Speidel’s»Lions,
undefeated in two meets, boast a
well balanced team that shut out
Cornell, 32-0, the last time out.

Though successful in their strug-
gle to remain undefeated, the Kent
State grapplers were well matted
by the Panthers‘. Even Pitt's novice
wrtstlers, Tony Razzan_o and Bill
Ewing, though defeated, turned
in performances that brought praise
from Peery.

In two crowd pleasers, Ray Cap-
peéli, Pitt”s 128 pounder, decisioned
Tom Hansen, 11-5, and Pitt’s Frank
Clark won a 7-0 decision over
Cfnuck Russell, Kent's 136 pound
entrant.

Conklin registered a fall against

Face Big Names

On their road trip to the Midwest,
Pitt faces within the space of six
days Bradley, Arkansas, and Okla-
homa A.&M. ,

Bradley, led by All-American’s
Paul Unruh and Gene Melchiorre,
5-8 pivotman, hosts the Panthers
on Feb. 4. Last season, Pitt ex-
tended the Braves before losing in
the final minutes, 52-50.

"We are being held over at Brad-
ley by popular demand,”explained
Doc Carlson, the Panther coach.

Deep Freeze Expected

Carlson expects real deep freeze
tactics when his Panthers go up
against Hank Iba and his ball con-
trolling Oklahoma Aggies on Feb.
8. "We’ll probably have a 0-0 game
at half since we both stress a pos-
session game,” he joked.

Arkansas, on Feb. 6, rounds out
the brief Western excursion.

McCrossin
Tops Scorers

With his near-record 35 points
against Grove City boosting his
scoring totals over the 100 mark,
Pitt’s ‘hoop captain, George Mc-
Crossin still maintains his scor-
ing lead with lll points.

McCrossin has averaged 14 points
a game. The team average is 47
points a game on a 32.8 shooting
percentage.

Pitt has outscored its opponents
from the field, 147 to 145, but trails
badly at the foul line, 125 to 86.

Skiers Sing the Blues

BY GEORGE E. BARBOUR
It’s June_ in January, but there are several Pitt students not in

love with the weather.

Members of the Pitt Ski Club, although they like balmy spring
weather, do not particularly care for balmy winter weather. The
skiers want snow, plenty of snow. »

Besides waxing their skis and
keeping a sensitive eye on the
weatherman during the present snow
drought, the clubmembers attend a
weekly club meeting and regular
Friday afternoon skating sessions
at Duquesne Gardens.

Wnen possible, the program com-
mittee arranges for noted skiers to
lecture the club. Two outstanding
skiers who have lectured in the
past are Fritz Loosli and Doc Des
Roche s. Loosli, a Swiss—Canadian,
rules the ski activities at Hotel
Chateau Frontenac, Quebec. Des
,Roches~is director of Laurel Ridge
Ski Lodge near Ligonier.

From the meetings, the novice
skier soon learns that "herringbone”
is not a fish bone, but a method» of
climbing hills on skis. They also
learn "gelaendesprung” is not an
immoral word, buta ski jump overan
obstacle.

By ice-skating every Friday,
club members are able to keep into
the perfect condition which skiing

demands.

"They keep in good condition,”
pointed out Ray Swaney, the club’s
president, because they have not
given up hopes of skiing this year,
Today, they look forward to favor-
able ski éonditions with the _same
spirit as they had at the brushing
party during the fall.”v

At the brushing party, members
cleared the slopes of Laurel Ridge

Trail of rubbish and debris in antic- ,

ipation of late autumn snow. The
snowhas not arrived as yet.

"The Club belongs to the Ama-
teur Ski Association and in the fu-

V ture We hope to participate in inter-

collegiate ski meets,” Swaney said.
Another future plan is the build-

ing of a ski lodge in the Laurel
Mountains.

Little Geniuses Outshine Pro essors

, By ANN MERITZER
Recently the little geniuses known as the Quiz Kids have been a
out-professoring the professors. Although some of the professors
from the University of Chicago are among the most brilliant men
of the country, the Kids have been making them look downright

inferior.
The Joel Kuppermans, who eat,
sleep, and imbibe knowledge,

calculate difficult answers in their
mind’s eye while their contempo-
raries are still copying down the
problem.

We all know what the Quiz Kids

A are like now, but what will they be

like in twenty or thirty years from
now? ~

fessors they willbe justas brilliant

in their future life as they are now.
Other learned men here knock the
little brain-trusters off their pedes-
tals. i

Professor Amazed A
Dr. Aaron Lazovik, assistant pro-
fessor of psychology, is amazed at
these intellectual wizards and be-
lieves that they will continue to

-excel among intellectuals .

Referring to the adult life of the
Quiz Kids, Robert X. Graham, head
of the journalism department, said
that "a number of Quiz Kids gradu-
ated from the radio program and have
been doing above average work in
college.”

Mr. Graham believes that ‘near
genius makes‘ a poor professor.”
These men would probably expect“
too much from their students and
have little patience with them.

Quiz Kids Tough
Some of the professors queried
emphatically stated that they did
not think they could stand up against

O the Quiz Kids and hoped they would

never be subjected to the ordeal.

On the other hand, "Anybody
can do tricks on the radio,” was
the answer given by Dr. George B.
Fowler, professor of history.

"If they are handled properly,”
he added, "they might turn out all
right in spite of themselves.”

Another dissenter was Dr. Warren
R. Witz, associate professor of

 

botany. He says, "The background
of child prodigies usually shows
them to turn out failures. Their

egotism generally defeats them

sooner or later.”

Study Shows That Cathedral

Cannot Be Blown Down

The thought, "Wonder how a strong wind affects it,” crosses
the minds of many people when they look up at the Cathedral. To
some with strong imaginations, it gives something to worry about.

But an experiment conducted by
three Pitt seniors studying civil
engineering in 1935 claims there's‘
-no cause to worry.

The seniors, Herbert Lebrenz,
Robert Frew, and William Himes,
were so interested in the question,
that they decided to write their
theses on 

After a long process /of study,
they found that at the most the
Cathedral moves 44 one-hundredths
of an inch when the wind blows
48 miles an hour. In another study,
however, they found that the sun
made the Cathedral move more than
the wind. ’

This happens whenthe sun warms
a side of the Cathedral,and causes
it to expand and move toward its

shady side.

Also revealed by the students
was the fact that afterxa 24-hour
study on a day with an average
wind velocity of 4 miles per hour,
the Cathedral moved 695 thou-
andths of an inch in what seemed
to be a semi-circular direction.
