Sandinista Regime:
Here To Stay?

By MARTY WILLIS“

The Reagan Administration can-
not bring down the Sandinista
Government in Nicaragua no matter
how hard it tries, said Harold Sims
at a lecture Sunday entitled “Can the
U.S. Destablilize Nicagargua?"

Sims described the administra-
tion’s policy as “a gigantic failure
waiting to be fully exposed."

Sims, a specialist on Central
America who earlier this year visited
Honduras, offered several predic-
tions on the ClA‘s not-so-secret war
against Nicaragua.

“I just don‘t think that regime can
be overthrown, not externally," he
said, referring to the Sandinista
National Liberation Front (FSLN),
the dominant group in Nicaragua’s
revolutionary government. The
FSLN took power in July, 1979,
with the armed overthrow of the
longtime Somoza family dictator-
ship.

“Since it came to power, the
FSLN has proceeded to consolidate
its hold on the goveri.ment.... I

would predict that it will¢.*Ol‘_lt1m1€ t0

Defector: Jet Downing
‘Automatic Reaction’

By TOBY TROSKY
And BILL BREMMER

The Soviet downing of the
Korean airliner 007 on Sept. 1 pres-
ents a good view of the workings of
the Kremlin leadership, according to
Arkady Shevchenko, former ‘Soviet
ambassador and under secretary
general who defected to the U.S. in
1978. ’

“It was not a planned act, it was
illogical,“ Schevchenko told the
sold-out crowd at David Lawrence
Auditorium last night. “What hap-
pened was a product of the function-
ing of the Soviet system.

“There are rules and regulations
which should be applied to any
planes intruding Soviet airspace.
The pilot who shot down the plane
was only following those rules,"
Shevchenko added.

The Soviets detected two planes
—— a reconnaisance plane and a pas-
senger plane. There was confusion
distinguishing between the two.
Shevchenko said the result was an
automatic reaction‘ by ground con-
trol. “It is within the system of
government communication.”

All Soviet leaders could be
reached within seconds, no matter
where they are, for consultation.

, “The confusion that resulted from
the initial statement was inexcusa-

ble," Shevchenko said. “Communi-

cation is supposed to be more

sophisticated." _

After reporting to command, mil-
itary political leadership had two
hours to make decisions.

“There was no question that the
military was in trouble where the
identification of the planes was con-
cerned. After that, [Soviet Premier]
Andropov said to go along with the
rules. There was not enough time to
convene a meeting of the Politburo,"
Shevchenko said.

An additional concern was that
the plane would get out of Soviet
airspace, and if it were not shot
down, the local commanders would
be court-martialed. There are even
cases where commanders were shot
for allowing aircraft to stray too far
into Soviet territory, according to

Shevchenko. Unfortunately,‘ he
said, ‘they did not realize the
consequences.

“The responsibility lies within the
Soviet system itself and the political
system that approves these standing
rules,” Shevchenko said.

Shevchenko said that no one
wanted to cause a war with the
U.S.S.R. because of this mishap.
The Soviets were concerned with

America Blinded By
Its Own Ambitions

By TODD ERKEL

The misconceptions in the United
State’s view of Latin America -
specifically the crisis in the Central
American region -- are caused by
our myopic view of conflict, accord-
ing to a leading scholar in Latin
American studies.

Dr. Sergio Bitar, speaking before
a packed room at a noontime lecture
yesterday sponsored by Pitt‘s Center
For Latin American Studies, out-
lined both the political and eco-
nomic changes occurring in U.S.-
Latin American relations.

He presented highlights from his
paper, “United States-Latin Amer-
ica Relations: Shifts in Economic
Power and Implications for the
Future," which he completed as a
research scholar at the Woodrow
Wilson Center for International
Scholars iniwashington, D.C.

In an interview afterwards, Bitar
criticized the American public's per-

ceptions of the ongoing Central

American warfare.

“People in the United States usu-
ally do not perceive crisis until it
explodes," Bitar said. “They don‘t
perceive the structural and historical
aspects that are behind it.

“When it does explode, their first
reaction is to extinguish the crisis,
and it is easier to extinguish with
measures that appear effective in the
short term. Which measures are
they? Military action.”

Problems such as economic injus-
tice and crumbling structures —— pol-
itical and others — have not been
addressed over the long term,
according to Bitar.

“If you leave [those problems]
alone for many years, they will
explode," he said. “If you then face
that explosion by imposing some
forced status quo, then you are not
solving any problems, only creating
more problems.”

Even though its presence in the
region is undeniable, Bitar sees the
overall economic role _of the United

their security, but in this case, the
concern over the endangerment to
their security was imaginary.

“Soviet leadership faced one cru-
cial problem: security versus the
value of human life,” he said.

Shevchenko quoted from a
Washington Post article which drew
the conclusion that something was
wrong in the Kremlin because of
Andropov’s silence and the burden
on the military to explain the cir-
cumstances and justify the action.

The Post speculated that the
Soviet military was “getting the
upper hand." Shevchenko, however,
disagreed. He said the reason
Andropov was silent for such an
extended period of time revolved
around Andropov’s reputation as a
peace-loving man.

It was only natural to avoid com-
menting on the issue. It is a weakness
to be exposed, and it shows a wea-
kness in the military to be exposed
by the leadership. In this sense,
Shevchenko said he believes
Andropov’s power has not been
undermined.

Shevchenko said he feels that For-

geign Minister Andrei Gromyko’s

absence from the General Assembly
at the United Nations was a strategic
move on the part of the Soviets. The
Americans’ not letting Gromyko’s
plane land provided the perfect
excuse for the Soviets.

“Soviet-American relations are
the centerin determining Soviet for-
eign policy,” Shevchenko said.
“They feel that the U.S. is their main
adversary because it is the only one

strong enough to influence Soviet
behavior.”

The Soviet view towards the
White House, he said, is one of
mixed admiration and hatred.
Admiration because of the U.S. effi-
ciency and technological advances
and hatred because it is the only
country that stands in the way of

Soviet political interest and military
gains.
“Soviet leadership does not

understand the U.S.’ freedom of
press with leaks to the press, nor do
they understand the relationship of
the president with Congress and the
different factions within the govern-
ment. They don’t understand how
the press has so much influence on
White House decisions,” Shev-
chenko said.

In the Soviet Union, the govern-
ment does not have any real contact
with the population. Gromyko, for
example, has not stepped foot on the
streets of Moscow for the past 50
years, let alone the streets of New
York.

Soviet leaders remain in their
position for life, unless there are
extraordinary circumstances, unlike
American leaders.

Ninety-five percent of the Soviet
population has never seen a foreign
newspaper, including those from
communist countries, he said.

  

“Soviet indoctrination begins. at
infancy and lasts until death..It is a
life of permanent indoctrination —
in schools, books, everywhere,”
Shevchenko said.

Another contrast Shevchenko
pointed out was that the population
in the Soviet Union has a deep
respect for its army, unlike
Americans.

Commenting on Andropovis
position, Shevchenko said that it is
rare for a political leader to gain
recognition as quickly as Andropov
did, both within the government and
the party structures, unlike his
predecessors.

“He was victoriously and imme-
diately recognized by the whole
world as a strong Soviet leader. He
was considered to be a closet liberal
and a reformist. This image, how-
ever, is completely unfounded,”
Shevchenko said.

Shevchenko said he believes that
Andropov is at best a transitional
leader, but there is no doubt that he
is in command and has authority.

He stressed that there are areas in
which the Soviet Union would like
to cooperate with the United States.

One area is the accommodations
the Soviets must make in the arms
race. They must do so for two
reasons.

First, the military expenditures
are so great that they take up a sub-
stantial portion of the Gross
National Product (GNP).

Second, the Soviets believe that if
the arms race continues, the U.S.
can have a tremendous break-
through because of its technological
advancement. There is a real fear
that the Soviets would be so far
behind, that it would take a tre-
mendous effort to catch up.

He cited that the second reason is
that the Soviets are vitally interested
in maintaining economic and trade
relations with the U.S. Relations
with the U.S. are much more impor-
tant than those with other non-
communist countries. ‘

Finally, he said the Soviet Union
has common interest with the U.S.
in areas such as environmental pres-
ervation and the non-proliferation
of nuclear weapons.

He said the Soviets view the world

development as a permanent strug-r

gle between capitalism and Soviet
socialism, and they feel socialism
will dominate. They have no timeta-
ble for their plans, however.

“It would be dangerous to cut off
relations with the Soviet Union. The
Soviet people are not responsible for
the views of their government. They
are a great people with great tradi-
tions,” Shevchenko said.

  Lecture

Set

Edwin Black, associate dean
of the graduate school at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin and profes-
sor of communication arts, will
present the annual Jack Mat-
thews Lecture, Thursday, Sept.
22, at 8 p.m. in the William Pitt
Union Ballroom.

Black, who taught at Pitt from
I961 through 1967, will lecture
on “Secrecy and Disclosure as
Rhetorical Forms.”

The lecture is open to
members of the university com-
munity, and there is no admis-
sion charge. The department of
communication will host a recep-
tion following the event.

The Matthews Lecture was
established last year by the
friends and colleagues of Jack
Matthews, who served as chair-
man of the former department of
speech and theatre arts from
I955 to 1982.

Black has published widely in
the area of rhetorical criticism,
and his 1966 work, Rhetorical
Criticism: A Study in Method,
received the Annual Award for

Computer Program Comes To Buhl

By JEFFREY BUTLER

At the Buhl Science Center, a
project that will teach the public
in the field of computers is in the
planning stages.

The project will consist of two
components. One is a computer
learning lab that opened in the
beginning of July and consists of
24 microcomputers. Buhl offers
programs to accompany the lab,
such as classes and educational
programs for the general public.

The second component is the
design of a permanent exhibit
that has to do with computers in
the field of robotics. This is also
in the planning stages.

Students and faculty at Pitt
give a lot of input into the devel-
opment and implementation of
programs at the science center.

Dr. Descento, one of the
directors at Buhl, said that as of
now, the development is on a
small scale. For example, there
is a student in the music depart-
ment at Pitt whose specialty is

One free introductory Reading Dynamics lesson
will prove itto you. Spend Just one hour with
Evelyn Wood this week and, in that very first
lesson, you'll see a dramatic increase in your
reading speed.

Think what that kind of reading power can meaﬂ

the amount of time you spend, but on the

Learning Research and Develop-

“The science center’s dream
is to somehow evolve Buhl from
what it is now — a modest place
centered around the planeta-
rium — into a major science cen-
ter with more space, different
exhibits and more classes for
people of all ages,” Klopfer said.

There will be an Educational
Computing Exposition taking
place at Buhl, Oct. 7-9. This dis-
play is designed to give an over-
view of the Buhl Science
Center's programs for schools
and their computer learning lab.

Ellen Richman, author of the
computer text, “Spotlight On

present to give an address to the

The Pitt News, Wednesday, September 21, I933

Think Before
Building

The university is currently considering building 17
to 20 townhouses on its vacant Bouquet Street
property.

The proposal was submitted last month by Ryan
Homes Inc., and if approved by the university, the
townhouses will be built by the same company. In the
Sept. 19 edition of The Pitt News, it was reported that
if the houses are built, they will be sold on a priority
basis to Pitt’s faculty and staff. If the demand is not
great, then the houses will be sold to the public at large.

Developing the property, which is an eyesore to the
Oakland community, is a good idea. But since Pitt is a
university, its first priority should be with the student
population and not the general public.

Every winter term, the Housing Office conducts a
lottery to determine which students will be ensured
dorm space and which students will be left out in the
streets without university housing. The students who
do not draw a number are put on a waiting list, and
some students do not know if they have a room until
the fall term nears.

With such a large waiting list and the lack of decent
apartments in Oakland, it would only make sense that
Pitt should develop the property as dorm space for
students instead of giving it to the public. The City of
Pittsburgh is not lacking in the housing market, and
residents of the city can always find a place to live.

Even faculty and staff members at Pitt can afford
better living conditions than those that exist in Oak-
land, and if the university were to take a poll, it would
probably find that most faculty and staff members
prefer to get out of the Oakland area anyway once the
work day is finished.

The Bouquet Street lot would be an ideal location
for dorm rooms since it is close to campus but not
exactly in the mainstream of campus traffic.

If the idea of building dorms is not appealing to the
university, then the idea of building parking lots or
parking garages for students, faculty and staff should
certainly be considered.

With the parking situation as it exists already, the
university would not only gain favor with workers and
students who drive, but it would also make for very
good public relations. The city would see that Pitt is
doing something good for its workforce (one of the
largest in the city) and for the students who attend
school here.

Pitt has done a lot for this city by employing great
numbers of people, giving them an institution of
higher education that is one of the best in the land and
so much more. But with the amount of land and
holdings that Pitt has, it should be about time the
students benefit a little more, also.

Letters To The Editor

I Dear Editor:

In response to the opinion on
‘animal rights and to Dr.Go1d-
schmidt’s claim that animal
rights activists are uninformed, I
would like to add some facts.
Speciesism is the most violent
and deeply ingrained form of
prejudice. We believe that racism
is indefensible and that sexism is
likewise deplorable. Yet many
people are still willing to allow
the interests of one species to
override the rights of other spe-
cies. This form of discrimination
is every bit as immoral.

A favored justification for
man’s dominion over the other
life forms is his claim to intelli-
gence, but other species‘ intelli-
gence is of a different form.
Non-humans are capable of elab-
orate planning, complex con-
struction, decision-making,
sonar, strategy, family loyalty
and unselfish love. Some of their
faculties are superior to ours.

In addition to the use of family
pets—obtained from pound seiz-
ures or theft———in live-animal
experiments, laboratories use
domestic and wild animals for
experimentation.

The Animal Welfare Act,
which sets standards for the care
and treatment of animals, does
not include birds, laboratory rats

- and mice. Inspections for com-

pliance are less than 3 percent
because of limited appropria-
tions. When an anesthetic is
used, it is generally employed
only while the injury is being
inilicted on the animal, which
afterwards may live days, weeks
or months.

Clearing Up Misconceptions About Sororltles

Dear Editor:

I am writing concerning Todd
Erkel’s article, “On The Outside
Looking In”, which appeared in The
Pitt News on Monday, Sept. 19,
1983. I would like to clarify, or
should I say correct, Erkel’s errone-
ous statements about sororities and
Greeks in general. Erkel seems to
believe that sorority members are a
bunch of spoiled, stuck-up “daddy’s
girls” who are at college to party it
up while they major in “marriage”
and abuse daddy's checkbook. Erkel
also has the absurd notion that sor-
orities select their pledges by such
criterion as “hip and bust measure-
ments” and a girl's ethnic
background.

Well, Todd, you’ve got it all
wrong, and I’d like to let you and
any other non-Greeks know what
it’s really like to be on the inside
looking out.

Since it is the rush season, I’ll
begin by clarifying exactly what rush
is and how it works for the sororities
at Pitt. Any girl that is interested in
joining a sorority or ﬁnding out
more about them can sign up for
rush. Formal rush lasts for 10 days
and during that period each sorority
holds non-alcoholic rush parties in
the sorority suites or houses. These
parties are designed to give the
rushees a chance to meet the individ-
uals that are the backbones of all
sororities.

A rushee gradually narrows down
her choices of sororities, and the sor-
orities do the same with the rushees.
Each sorority looks for girls that
want to be enriched by Greek life
and that want to contribute to a sis-
terhood that matches their own
ideals and purposes.

I believe that “going Greek” is not
for everyone, but I feel that rush is
an excellent opportunity for girls to
meet other students and to have the

. opportunity to find out if Greek life

is for them.

Paying dues, initiation fees and
buying pins are also part of being
Greek. Monthly dues for a sorority
range between $20 to $27, initiation
fees can be up to $100 and, yes, pins
of pearls do cost anywhere from $70
to $100. Some people may wonder,
“w_lia_t__d9es__all_of this buy you?"

Well, to begin with, sororities
have suites or houses that are deco-
rated very beautifully‘-and they
spend thousands of dollars to main-
tain them. These suites and houses
are used everyday by the sisters and
provide a home away from home for
the girls. Secondly, most sororities
have formals, informals and various
other social functions that are paid
for by dues.

National sororities also help to
maintain their national offices
which establish new chapters to
expand the sorority and develop
alumna chapters across the country.
Granted, the fees do add up, but
Todd, I feel that you really over-
stepped yourself in implying that
“daddy's checkbook” is the source of
these fees. This is not true in my case
and for well over half of my sorority.
Many of my sisters work to pay their
dues, in addition to carrying a full
load of credits every term, while
maintaining an above average
Q.P.A. This also adds to their other
extra-curricular activities and com-
munity involvement.

Greek life is not just parties, par-
ties and more parties; there is truly
such a thing as community service
alive and well among the Greeks
here at Pitt. It’s called Greek,Week,
that wonderful “week” that turns
into months and months of planning
and hard work by all who partici-
pate in it. In the past two years, the
Greeks at Pitt have raised over
$60,000 for the Arthritis Founda-
tion’s research «at Pitt’s medical
school, along with collecting blood
for Pittsburgh's Central Blood
Bank.

Playing With Typewriter‘

Dear Editor:

Well, well, well, I guess it's that
time of the year again. The Pitt
News wasn’t getting enough let-
ters to the editor so its staff
decided to print yet another in a
long list of irresponsible articles.
Last year, Mark Sindler burned
fraternities at the stake, and this
year, Todd Erkel let loose on sor-
orities. At least Mr: Sindler had
some personal experiences with
fraternities. I sincerely doubt
that Mr. Erkel was ever invited
to join a sorority.

The only motives I can think
of that would explain the staff‘s
decision to print Mr. Erkel's rav-
ings are sensationalism and mali-

ciousness. Printing such a
negatively biased, completely
unfounded opinion right at the
beginning of sorority rush was
irresponsible to say the least. I
don’t expect The Pitt News staff
to rush for us, but then neither do
I expect the staff to go out of its
way to hinder us. Every sorority
on this campus puts a lot of time
and money into rush. To have
Mr. Erkel publicly ridicule our
efforts was insulting and
uncalled for.

Come on Todd, the secret is
out now. What sorority woman
told you that you would be better
off playing with your typewriter?

‘Diversity Is A Strength’

Dear Editor:

The recent editorial, “Change
Tactics,” advised opponents of the
nuclear arms race to abandon the
“radicalism" of civil disobedience
and hunger strikes in favor ofa more
“subtle" approach. While I appre-
ciate your obvious concern for the
welfare of these groups, Imust point
out the following:

0The likelihood of nuclear war
alarms diverse kinds of people, who
collectively practice no unified “tac-
tic” to reflect upon or change. Clergy
preach, experts lecture, poets write
poems, some folks go to jail, others
starve themselves. We each do what
our abilities allow and our commit-
ment demands. The threatened end
of civilization leads a few to “take it
a little far," but most of us don't.
This diversity is a strength.

GTO be honest, most activism isn’t
intended to directly change govern-
ment or corporation policy, and it is
perfectly OK if “hunger strikers hurt

nobody but themselves," because ' n  |  m e 

they’re not trying to hurt anybody.
The real point is to galvanize public
opinion (which is already opposed
to the nuclear arms race) with ajusti-
fied sense of urgency and to express
heartfelt revulsion at our world's
impending suicide.

OI question the assertion that
these groups are quickly losing pub-
lic respect. The more dramatic ones
are merely part of a growing spec-
trum of concerned citizens whose
membership increases daily, and
whom, thanks to the polls, Reagan
does in fact take seriously. Could it
be the editorial writer, instead of
“the public,” who is “beginning to
get sick of them?" This sickness is
ominous. To downplay potential
global disaster may help get the
newspaper out every day, but ulti-
mately, it is an irrational tactic with
a poor prognosis. Perhaps it is this
tactic that demands change.

This year the Greeks will be at it
again, working for a new charity, the
Pittsburgh Family House. Concern-
ing these acts of charity Todd asked,
“where does the real motivation lie?”
Well, for me, and I’m sure that I'm
not alone, it lies in the feeling that
deep down inside you know that
you’re doing something worthwhile
by_helping others and that you’re
building your own character as well.

I could go on and on about what
fun Greeks have and how involved
they are all over campus in activities
that range from SGB to athletic
teams; however, it is hard to inter-
pret the true meaning of sisterhood

or brotherhood in words, it is some-
thing that must be experienced to be
understood. Becoming a sister at a
sorority or a brother at a fraternity
creates very special bonds of friend-
ship and love that cannot be
expressed in a letter. College is a
time to learn not only what is in the
text books, but also about yourself
and the people around you.

Greek life adds to this experience,
it brings to you friendships and a
lifetime commitment filled with pre-
cious memories and continuous
enrichment. No, Todd, going Greek
isn’t for everyone, but it does pro-
vide tremendous opportunities for

those who seek what it does have to

offer. Granted, your article did
appear on the “Opinion" page, but I
don't think that you as a person
should be so quick to stereotype and
judge others, in this case sorority
girls.

As a journalist, you should
research ‘your topics more thor-
oughly and get facts to support your
articles, not rumors heard through
the “sour-grapevine.”

G reeks: More Understanding

Dear Editor:

I would like to commend Mr.
Todd Erkel for his fine example of
investigative reporting. I have to
wonder how Mr. Erkel found time
to study assuming the countless
hours he must have put into research
for his article, “On The Outside
Looking In,” in the Sept. 19 issue.
He should spend less time worrying
about making the deadline and
spend ore time on the
investigation.

I am not going to waste words
commenting on the rude remarks,
but rather, I will concentrate on his
socialistic criticisms. His main or ti-
cism is that of human nature. Si ice
we live in a very aggressive societ ', it
is not surprising that people wa' . to
feel different or special and thus‘ on-
gregate in groups that share a com-

Dear Editor:

After many years of criticism
directed at the rush parties of cam-
pus fraternities, the Interfraternity
Council (IFC) and its member fra-
ternities decided to conduct a non-
alcoholic introduction to the
fraternity movement this Sep-
tember. This decision was reached
after months of serious deliberation.

The university had organized a
task force last year to study the issue
of alcohol abuse on campus and to
make recommendations on how to
raise consciousness levels about
such abuse and its results. It was
hoped that an enlightened student
body would avoid excessive use of
alcohol. The Interfraternity Coun-
cil, aware ofthis issue, was genuinely
concerned because of a number of
problems that had occurred in the

mon interest. This can be done in
many different ways via religion,
politics, education, social groups,
etc. It can be argued that we as stu-
dents of a university feel that we are
special or above those who, for dif-
ferent reasons, got only as far as high
school. Not everyone can qualify for
or afford a fraternity or sorority
membership, but then again, not
everyone can qualify for or afford
higher education.

I believe that less criticism and
more understanding should be given
to the Greek system as a whole. It is
very easy to criticize that of which
we are ignorant. Mr. Erkel seems to
feel that the Greek system is a social
injustice. If you were to study the
history of fraternities and sororities,
you would find that their reason for
formation was to battle social injus-

Needed

past when the behavior of visitors to
fraternity houses could not be com-
pletely controlled during large rush
parties.

In

As a voting member of the IFC
who participated in the discussions
and decision-making process, I can
honestly assert that the institution of
a dry rush as an introduction to fra-
ternity life was not the result of pres-
sure from university personnel. On
the contrary, the IFC sought to clar-
ify the fact that the purposes of fra-
ternities are not merely to make
alcohol available to members and
guests as the uninformed might mis-
takenly believe.

Since cooperation of all the frater-
nities on campus was needed to
implement a dry rush, it was not easy
to win sufficient acceptance to enact

tices. This is especially true for those
“ethnic-based" fraternities and
sororities.

The Greek system has much to
offer, not only socially but educa-
tionally as well. It is difficult to
express in words the satisfaction I
get from the friendships I have
gained through my fraternity expe-
riences. I can not see how working
together and socializing together sti-
fles one’s “individual expression," I
would say it does more to enhance it.

On behalf of myself and others
who share my opinion, I wish that
those who have participated in the
Greek system and have found it at
no fault — to then criticize the sys-
tem; not to criticize the system on
the basis of looking in from the

this major change. Nonetheless, it
was done.

In light of this sincere effort to
promote alcohol awareness and the
ideals of the fraternity movement, it
is most regrettable that the univer-
sity administration has not taken an
active role in facilitating implemen-
tation of this change with which the

university is obviously in agreement.
Fraternities are officially recognized
student organizations that could
greatly benefit from some contribu-
tion of the vast resources of the uni-
versity when the welfare of its
students would be so favorably
promoted.

Co-ops: A Tradition that Beats the High Cost ofEating

By cousms FERRIS

An age-old tradition is alive and
well right here in Oakland. The food
co-op is a non-profit consumer
cooperative offering fresh, nutri-
tious, natural and reasonably-priced
foods during these economically dif-
ficult times.

Diversity in membership is what
makes the Semple Street Co-op an
interesting place, as it has members
from all walks of life. It serves every-
one from senior citizens to Oakland
residents and students. Many pro-
fessionals also frequent the co-op.

A co-op behaves generally like
other businesses, paying taxes and
operating on business principles. In
many ways, however, the co-op is a
unique venture.

Every member owns the store
through the collective purchase of
shares. No matter how many shares
an individual member may hold, he
gets one vote on store issues and in
electing the Board of Directors of
the co-op.

To become a member of the Sem-
ple Street Co-op, one must attend a
45-minute orientation session to
become familiar with the co-op’s his-
tory and the duties and privileges of
a member. Members are also
required to work in the store one
hour per month.

“One. day, some members
painted the store, which took about
eight hours” said one long-time

Co-op history dates back to the
19th century England, when a group
of weavers were blacklisted from
some stores. To maintain survival,
they began a cooperational society.

Some of the principles they
adopted, which are still upheld
today, include the one member-one
vote policy, access to all people, di-
vision of dividends on an equal basis
and consumer education.

Non-members are permitted to
shop at the coop but are not eligible
to enjoy the 20 percent discount
members receive.

At co—ops, you can buy the
amount of food you specifically
need. For example, grocery and
convenience stores sell eggs by the
dozen, but they are sold separately
in co-ops.

Because the co-ops do not sell set
quantities of items and because
there are member and non-member
prices to be taken into considera-
tion, comparison shopping is diffi-
cult. Some items, however, are
much lower in price at co—ops
whether they are sold to members
or non-members.

Even if you’re “cutting the fat” in
your budget, co-ops allow you to
save money without cutting down
on nutrition.

BVMARK A. SINDLER

There is more in the air nowa-
days than merely tainted odors of
autumn and chilling breezes.
Instead, discontent is slowly emerg-
ing, disaffection that pierces the air
more thoroughly than any overnight
frost.

Shelton Collier, Pitt's women's
volleyball coach, feels caught
squarely between the jaws of an all-
encompassing athletic administra-
tion. It is not so much that he is
encumbqed by frustration, but
rather that he implores a more rec-
ognizable image. One of which he
contends he is deserving.

Possibly it is easy to imagine Col-
Iier's predicament.

Money.

After tne completion of last week-
end's Pitt Classic, which the Lady
Panthers won, Collier spilled the
beans which connoted notions ofhis
operating from an overly confining
corner.

The fourth-year coach is currently
guiding a I0-member roster with the
same budget he was handed in 1979.
No increase. no decrease. Mean-

time, the law of averages has seen
inflation cruise to the tune ofdouble
digits annually.

Consumer price indexes, cost-of-
living levels and similarly nifty eco-
nomic indicators will not even be
considered.

What does sound of considerable
importance, though, is that Collier
might be consumed with a slow
burning rage for good reason. The
two schools Pitt defeated in the clas-
sic, Louisville and Florida State,
ﬂaunt budgets twice the size of
Collier‘s.

“I cannot help but envy that
women's sports are important and
supported at these other universi-
ties," Collier said several days ago.
“Our players and our program have
earned and deserved much more
consideration.

“It's common knowledge in colle-
giate and recruiting circles that we
have an excellent team, but a declin-
ing program. My comment to that
is. ‘it's a shame.‘ "

A lot of hot air? As usual, that can
be left to conjecture. But the record
is an interesting one. the type that

speaks independently. In three pre-
vious years, Collier has amassed a
I22-36 slate, or one loss in slightly
over four matches.

For the record, add a current I2-I
supplement. Also, add last season's
Big East championship, the confer-
ence‘s first, and the year before, a
ninth place finish in the defunct
Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women — replaced by
the NCAA.

Paradoxically, Collier alleges he's
in a no-win situation.

“I can't really say [the athletic
adm.] is punishing me for winning
because every year we seem to win,"
he added. “Every year we seem to
pull out a good season with the
travel, equipment and scholarship
budget that we have.

“Each year they seem to say.
‘Maybe [the team] will do okay on
that same money.‘ "

No one seems to acknowledge cer-
tain limits. however. Limits being
those two wins in the classic, despite
a key injury in one and two equally
key injuries in the second. All this.
against a full complement of rosters.

“If we would have lost all three
matches, it would have sounded like
sour grapes," Collier contended.
“[Yet] we beat two teams with a full
roster, with a team that had injuries.

“Going into the tournament, we
were not expected to beat Florida
State or Louisville. Yet, we are still
not an important or respected part
of the athletic department.

“Otherwise we wouldn't have the
same budget we did in I979."

Seeing how Collier comes across
as frank as he is could be some type
of precedent. It is a generally known
fact that any non-revenue coach at
the university (though departmental
officials seem “more comfortable“
with the ‘varsity sports‘ label)'will
state that his budget comes close to
equaling the per-capita status of
Nigerian tribespeople.

It is also a forgone conclusion that
athletic administrators are well
aware more of the sounded-out
gripes than the private ones which
non-revenue coaches undoubtedly
harbor within. Collier has already
been through the office and com-
munication channels.

Terps Baffle
Opponents

By SCOTT DELLETT

One concern for the young
Panther offense next Saturday in
their game at Maryland is the unique
defense the Terrapins employ.

The title is the wide tackle six, a
defense used since the Jerry Clair-
borne era and continued by current
Terrapin coach Bobby Ross when he
took over last year.

“I'm a believer in any style of
defense. There is really no differ-
ence," Maryland head coach Bobby
Ross said. “But with the passing
game the way it is in college, with
four defensive lineman, it gives a
good pass rush.

“We use it because that's the
defense we know and what we
believe in. The players have been
using it for years and they feel more
comfortable with it."

Like most defenses, the effect is to
create a blocking shortage on the
weak side. so the opposing quarter-
back is rushed into making a
mistake.

“All defenses put mental pressure
on the quarterback," Pitt head
coach Foge Fazio said during yester-
day's press conference. “The idea is
when they blitz, they will have eight
men rushing and the offense won't
have eight people to block."

The wide tackle six has been com-
pared to a 4-4 defense, one which
Penn State has used in the past, but
there are differences. In the 4-4,
there are only two down linemen as
the two defensive ends usually serve
as linebackers. In the wide tackle six,
there are four down linemen, two
tackles and two nose guards.

Temple used the 4-4, but compar-
ing the Owls defense to Maryland is
nearly impossible.

“Maryland is physically stronger
than Temple and they have better
talent,” Fazio said. “Maryland‘s de-
fensive line is three inches taller and
30 pounds heavier."

' Co|lier’s Beef With AD Ordered Well Done

So far, it is none too difficult to
compare him to a tractor trailer
driver futilely negotiating a bottle-
neck tunnel. Fit it won't.

“I've expressed our needs, and
that's my job -— to give the best pos-
sible product and to work with the
athletes," Collier said. “I've
expressed the needs of our program
every year.

“Come I983, this is what we need,
this is what our competition has and
the budget figures came out. It's the
same thing you have in l979.“

Figuring out the intricate process
the athletic department utilizes in
doling out money is not exactly per-
tinent here. Already, must it be
repeated again?, the men's volleyball
program and field hockey team have
been axed within the past year.

The sufficient funds just were not
there, one could hear Athletic Direc-
tor Edward Bozik or his associate,
Dean Billick. indicate with credibil-
ity. Many others voiced dissension,
taunting and challenging that credi-
bility.

Wlnnlng, Recelvlng Serves Fun For

By LAURIE KUBLI

A long, long time ago, in a high
school not so far, far away, Kris
Wexell suffered a loss on the volley-
ball court. That single loss is a mere
drop in the bucket of 86 victories
over roughly three and a half years.

Twelve of those 86 successes came
while Wexell was a member of the
Lady Panther volleyball team, the
defending Big East champs. Shelton
Collier, the Lady Panthers‘ coach,
attributes his team's success to date
to position specialization.

“The reason for our success is that
I get the most out of each player,
each has a certain role on the team,"
Collier said.

Wexell, a freshman nursing stu-
dent, has a specialization that is so

sophisticated, so unique, that proba-
bly no other team employs it: It is
Wexell’s responsibility to receive as
many serves as possible, no matter
where she is on the floor. Serve-
reception is probably the least popu-
lar aspect of volleyball; nevertheless,
Wexell enjoys her unique position.

“I think it’s fun,” she said with a
smile. “Knowing that if it’s any-
where near me, I’m going to get it, is
a great feeling to have. It has built
my confidence."

Confidence in Wexell's ability is
something Collier expresses often.

“One of the keys to our winning
comes from our serve-reception
patterns, which center around Kris,"
Collier remarked.

“Kris is tough and highly skilled,"

the Pitt coach continued. “She’s our
number one server, is at practice
every day and is an extremely effec-
tive and explosive spiker as well.
She’s perfect for our team; we play
an emotional, aggressive game, and
so does she."

Collier first began recruiting three
years ago, when Wexell was a
sophomore on Norwin High
School's very successful team;
Coach Sheron Watson has led her
teams to eight straight state cham-
pionships in class AAA. The Pitt
coach recruited her for the Pitts-
burgh Junior Olympics, for which
she was voted All-America in her
junior and senior years in high
school.

“I told her she would get a schol-
rz.rship and a starting position at Pitt

 
   
  
  
 
 
  

 

if she decided to come here," Collier
said.

Meanwhile, Wexell led Norwinto
its sixth, seventh and eighth victories
as a starting middle-blocker in her
junior year, and as co-captain in her
senior year. On the Junior Olympics
team for three years she led it to a
fifth-place finish at the national
championships as a sophomore and
a fourth-place finish as a senior.

“When she came here, we restruc-
tured our serve-reception patterns,
but she still gets her fair share of
spikes,“ Collier said.

“I wasn’t expecting to be a
spiker," Wexell maintained. “Most
coaches didn’t express an interest in
my spiking, but Coach Collier has
helped me a lot, has been really sup-
portive of my ability to hit. But, I’m

not really a middle blocker, like Car-
men Tapia or Ulana Kohutiak,
although I get a few,” she added.

Many athletes find thejump from
high school to college at least rough,
if not insurmountable. Wexell, like
Collier, cited position specialization
as the biggest difference.

“You have different priorities
here, more specific situations.
Before [in high school], it was get-
ting the ball over the net," Kris
explained. “Now, for me, it's mainly
serve reception. We all have our lit-
tle jobs — it‘s more specialized
here.”

Wexell covers a lot of area as

Pitt’s serve-receptionspecialist, but
volleyball is not her whole life here.

Panther Cross Town

For Opening Meet

By CHARLIE O'HARA

The Pitt men's cross country team
begins its I983 season this weekend
‘as it travels across town to Robert
Morris for a tri-meet, which will
match the Panthers with the Colo-
nials and the Duquesne Dukes.

It is a young team that will be
stepping to the line on Saturday for
the Panthers. In fact, the bulk ofthe
responsibility will be resting on sev-
eral Panthers who will be competing
for their first time at the collegiate
level.

“We have a lot of freshmen on
whom we will be counting," Pitt
coach John Vasvary said. “We have
two experienced runners [seniors
Todd Colas and Bill Moorhead]
back, but we lost Darren Geary,
John Hutchison and Terry Gal-

The returning Panthers are

The meet is the only time that the
city's Division I schools compete in
cross country.

“We really don't have any chance
at all to win,” Robert Morris coach
Bruce Frey said. “We’re having the
meet to bring together the three
schools. We want a good relation-
ship with the two."

For Collier, though, he finds him-
self one day approaching a point of
no return. If he has not found it
already, he cannot quite reveal what
his next move would be.

“I’m going to be in a position here
very shortly where I'm going to have
to leave and take a desk job some-
where,” Collier implied without dis-
¢f¢Pan_cy. “My goals and
expectations and the team's goals
and expectations are very high, and
we ve proven we can reach those
goals and expectations.

“.We_just want an opportunity to
maintain that."

Considering such intentions, per-
haps nothing more might sound
surprising.

‘‘I’m in a position where I’m good
enough and successful enough that I
can say some things without really

blasting [the administration]," he
continued. “This has to be attended
to in a way. There's not a collegiate
volleyball team in the nation that
would have the same budget they
had in 1979.”

Regardless of any school’s budget
or any athletic administration's
stand taken toward its non-revenue
teams, there is no missing the fact
that Collier’s teams have done a
credible lot with virtually peanuts
with which to work.

Last year, despite injuries to star-
ters Ulana Kohutiak and Judy
Young, the squad surrendered one
mere loss at home all season and
suffered six more on the road for a
41-7 finish.

The same situation is transpiring
presently, two starters — Young and
junior Cathy Rupp —— out for at least
the next three weeks, leaving Collier

with eight players, the same he had
with last season‘s injuries.
More significant, though, is the

time,‘ or lack thereof, Collier has-

Spent in “transforming" women-’s
sport at Pitt. His initial stint came in

1980, the program six years in the‘

making
Hebert. _

At the 1980 junction, women’s
volleyball ascended to a regionally-
respected status similar to that of
Bob Uecker in major league base-
ball. Collier took all of two years to
place strongly at the AIAW
championships.

Along that way came wins over
California “Untouchables,” Pepper-
dine and UCal-Berkeley. There were
victories over Texas A&M, North-
western, Tennessee (thrice), Penn
State (twice last year), Georgia and
North Carolina State.

Major Beef

Florida State was ranked 20th
before the classic, last week.

The list can effortlessly continue,
the point being that said schools
carry unquestionable potential to
reach the lofty heights of Top 20
neighborhoods. Carrying the argu-
ment even further, Collier has never
fielded teams that neared such
potential.

Yet there they were defeating
(decisively is immaterial) schools far
from the tri-state area, schools that
pump money into such programs
like the guzzler who pours petro-
leum into his l8-foot El Dorado.

This leaves Collier in shadows
reaching the magnitude of stalagtite
caverns. He keeps winning with reg-
ularity and has no budget to show
for it. If his squad should ﬂounder,
which it should considering the
money backing it and the players

injured, then that would present the
administration with an unproduc-
tive appendage that would look
increasingly susceptible to
amputation.

That, at least, was an indirect rea-
son given to the men’s volleyball
team last year.

Desperation is not what Collier
emits. Contrastingly, he shudders at
the thought of where this tangled
mass of spaghetti leaves him.

It may be that he will simply pack‘

the bags and leave. Just last year he
turned down several offers to do so.

“I want to leave here with a suc-
cessful program and a reasonably
good working relationship with the
administration with the understand-
ing that this is not the way a program
should be run.”

“My classes are going OK." she
says. “My schedule isn’t bad now, as
far as conflicts with playing. but
when we go on the road. l‘ll miss

ne classes on Friday."

She hastened to add that this still
would not present much of a prob-
lem, since tutors are available.

For the present. this young star
casts a bright light on Pitt volleyball.
and Collier has nothing but praise
for her.

“What separates her from other
athletes is her intensity and concen-
tration. She relates extremely well to
the rest of the team and already has
leadership qualities. I expect her to
be a major factor in our winning the

. Maryland Defense Mystery

Panthers Must Solve

continued from page eleven
The athletes on the line prove
Fazio’s statement. Middle guards

Q Tyrone Furman and Tom Parker

are two keys to the defense. Furman
is 6-! and 255 lbs. while the fresh-
man Parker is 6-2 and weighs 264.
“They are quick for their size,“
assistant coach Dino Folino said.
“They put a considerable amount of
pressure on the defense."
Ross give particular praise to
Parker, who was redshirted last fall.
“Tom had a reasonably good
game against West Virginia," he
said. “He has made a lot of tackles
and big plays for us this season.“
What makes the defense unpre-

Qdictable, though, is the different set-

ups by the linebackers.

' “The placement ofthe two middle
‘linebackers IS different," Fazio said.

instead of staying in the middle,
they line up over the gap between the
guard and tackle." '

_ All of which causes mass confu-
sion. Last weekend, West Virginia
was having difficulties reading
Maryland’s schemes as Mountain-
eer quarterback Jeff Hostetler threw

two interceptions in the first half -
he only threw five in 1982 —— as the
Terrapins took an early 14-0 lead.

One big factor in West Virginia's
victory is the adjustment made in the
Maryland blitzing scheme.

the ball to the tight end over the
middle," Fazio said.

Even though the Terrapins only
use three defensive backs the major-
ity of the time, adjustments are fre-
quently made.

“One of the linebackers is really a
strong safety," Fazio said. “Some-
times, they use a robber’s scheme of
five defensive backs and double
team the wideouts.“

The wide tackle six could be a
source of confusion for Pitt, espe-
cially with sophomore John Con-
gemi starting at quarterback. How
the defense is solved will dictate the
Panthers’ success Saturday.

the week before, they were beaten by

"Westminster 26-31, after having
been swept (a sweep is when one
team takes the first five places in a
race) by the Titans in 1982.

“We've made definite improve-
ments in one year," Frey said. “It
was my first recruiting season, and I
think we've gained parity with the
teams in the area, except Pitt. We

tcan‘t think about beating Pitt or Bill
Moorhead."

Frey mentioned Moorhead‘s
name because of some comments
that the Panther standout made
after his team shutout the Colonials
last track season. Moorhead,
though purely in jest, referred to
Frey’s team as “Bobby M0.”

“The comments made last season

come a good way since the fall of
l982," Frey said. “We’re really only
concerned with Duquesne, though. I
think we can do well against them.”

Though the Colonials were nar-
rowly defeated by Westminster and
the Dukes beat Westminster, Frey
believes that his team is ready to give

‘them a good race, much more so
than- the shutout suffered by the
Colonials in 1982.

Vasvary claims that the meet will
be competitive. ‘

“We’re not sure what we can
expect from either team," he said. “I
haven’t seen either team perform
yet. And the fact that we’re relying
on some very inexperienced people
should make it interesting.

“Bruce Frey was a super-
competitive athlete when he ran for
the University of Virginia, and 1

prepared.

“We do know that the Dukes have
a student coach, which is a definite
advantage because he can actually
coach during the race. There aren’t
too many who can do that.”

The Colonials will be without the
services oftheir I982 No. l man, Jim
Wilson, who sprained his knee ear-
lier this season. It is basically a
young team; the top three per-
formers are no older than
sophomores.

As for the Dukes, they are a ques-
tion mark.

Under student coach Bruce Lane,
who is a graduate student with one
year of eligibility remaining, the
Dukes have defeated Westminster in
their only meet this season.

Though the Panthers are far from
a Division 1 power, they should eas-
ily take care of their crosstown foes.

It is vitally important that we all become more

It has been a parking lane carrying no traffic, so
