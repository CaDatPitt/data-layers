Pitt student dies of alcohol poisoning

Autopsy results in for the Pitt—Greensburg student who was found dead at a CM U fraternity.

John Manganaro
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

Results from the autopsy of a stu— V

dent who passed away last week
at a Carnegie Mellon fraternity
show that he died as a result

of alcohol poisoning, spark-
ing a strong reaction from Pitt
students and officials about the
risks of alcohol and party-related
behavior.

Matthew Tembo, a 22-year-
old student from France who at-

tended Pitt’s Greensburg campus, «

was at the CMU Pi Kappa Alpha
fraternity house on Morewood
Avenue for a birthday celebra-
tion when he died after “likely
drinking too much,” city police
detective Christine Williams said
at a press conference last week.
Responders found Tembo on Sat-

urday, March 6, around 1 p.m.

Edward Strimlan, chief foren-
sic investigator for the Allegheny
County Medical Examiner’s Of-
ﬁce, conﬁrmed Williams’ spec-
ulation yesterday with results
from the student’s autopsy.

performed an autopsy on Tembo
on March 8, Strimlan said, ﬁnd-
ing the death to be a result of
ethanol poisoning. This is the re-
port commonly associated with
those who die from drinking too
much, he said, adding that the
death was ruled an accident.
“As soon as we rule a death
to be accidental, the case moves
out of our hands,” Strimlan said.

“It is then up to the CMU and
Pittsburgh Police to decide if any
kind of charges should be ﬁled
against those involved.”
Strimlan could not speculate
about the likelihood of charges
being leveled against the frater-
nity, though he did acknowledge
that such actions are possible,
even though Tembo was of legal

drinking age at the time of his

death. As of yesterday, CMU and
city police officials could not say
whether any such charges were
in the works.

The most effective way to
avoid alcohol poisoning and
related alcohol risks is to “just
say no” to drinking, according

occur in the average college—age
person when his blood alcohol
level reaches 0.20 percent, ac-
cording to the Department of
Alcohol and Drug Prevention
and Education. The way alcohol
affects individuals varies largely
depending on the drinker’s toler-

- ance level, but reaching a blood

alcohol level of 0.20'takes about
seven drinks in the span of an
hour. _ . ' .

Even so, a heavy drinker might
not be at medical risk at 0.20
percent, though-a novice drinker
could be in serious danger.

It is vital that students be on
the lookout for signs of alcohol
poisoning, Pitt’s Student Health
Service website says, in order to
ensure their own safety and that
of otherswho might be drinking.
A person suffering from alcohol
poisoning might be unable to
stand or walk, breathing slowly
with 10 seconds or more between
breaths, passed out, unable to
awaken or unable to control basic

body functions. .

If there is any question as to
whether a person is suffering
from alcohol poisoning, medi-

cal attention should be ‘sought

immediately, the website says.
Pitt spokesman John Fedele
said Pitt has alcohol awareness
programs in place both on its
Oakland campus and in Greens-
burg, as well as counseling ser-
vices available through the Of-

students who are experiencing
any sort of alcohol problems.

From brains to ballots

Jimenez’s interest in politics be-
gan last year, when he ran for and

i won the presidency of the Gradu-

ate and Professional, Student As-
sembly. V .
However, it was not until the re-
cent student tax controversythat
he decided to take the next step and
tackle state politics. ' ‘
Jimenez began to speak at vari-
ous debates on the student tax is-
sue on behalfof the organization in
December. During these events he
met several campaign managers who

informed him about position open-
ings in the upcoming elections.

“I started seeingwhere the [polit-
ical] opportunities were,” he said.

One of those opportunities was a
position as an elected official on the
State Democratic Committee.

Five elected members of the State
Democratic Committee meet three
times a year to discuss political is-
sues in Pennsylvania. During their
winter meeting they vote on which
Democrat state candidates they will

endorse in the next election for the _

positions of U.S. senator, governor,

and lieutenant governor. The posi-
tion is a volunteer job. IfJimenez .

wins,.he will actually need to pay

. his own way for transportation and
accommodations during the meet-,

ings. '
“It’s pretty obscure,” Jimenez
said of the-position. “Some County

[Democratic] Committee members -

don’t even know what State Com-
mittee is.”

Jimenez said he still feels deter-
mined to run a strong race. He has

collected 243 signatures on his pe-
tition for placement on the ballot
—— far more than the 100 signatures
required. *
He spent about 20 hours knock-

of the 38th District of Pennsylvania
— which includes parts of Allegheny

- County — to collect the signatures
from residents of the district he

hopes to represent. Jimenez said he

plans to knock on more doors.as the

election grows nearer, this time to
lobby for people’s votes.

Jimenez is rtmning on a platform
primarily of improving job oppor-
tunities in the city and diversifying

T politics.

The election has not been easy
forjimenez to balance with his other
time commitments. He has already
determinedhe will need to push back
the completion of his dissertation on

_ neurobiology six months.

However,Jimenez is not disheart-

j ened by this turn of events.

“It’s fun,”Jimenez said ofbalanc—
ing his extracurricular schedule, “It’s
not monotonous. It’s always engag-

' ing. Everything’s rewarding, so it’s

not frustrating.

Most recently, Jimenez has fo-
cused his attention on achieving an
endorsement from the Allegheny
County Democratic Committee. On
March 7, the ACDC chose ﬁve of the
seven candidates running for the
position to endorse.

to win the endorsement. He had also

personally called all 536 members of

the ACDC, to introduce himselfand
ask for their vote. In total, Jimenez
spent around 30 hourslmaking these
phone calls.

In the end, his hard work paid off,
asJimenez was awarded an endorse-
ment. He was the highest male vote-
getter at the endorsement meeting
with 17.7 votes and earned 43 votes
more than the next closest male can-
didate. This victory means that his
name will be on the mailing of rec-
ommended candidates sent out by
the ACDC, somethingthatwill give a
strong boost to his campaign.

With the endorsement in hand,
Jimenez has shifted his focus to the
primary elections. “It will be -tough,”
he said, “but I would love to be the
top male vote-getter.”

Still, his primary goal is to help
educate others about the election
process. “It doesn’t matter if I win,”
Jimenez said. “The best thing that

Privatized Downtown-to-
Oakland route considered

Christen DiClaudio
For The Pitt News

Allegheny County Executive Dan Onorato
plans to make it easier to travel from Oak-
land to Downtown, but it might cost Pitt

‘students. ,

Onorato and the Transportation Action
Partnership, a task force of transportation
experts, recently extended an offer to private
investors around the world to ﬁnd a way to
make that happen. If a private investor con-
structs the corridor, it might not be included
in the ﬂat rate included in Pitt students’ trans-
portation fees. '

If all goes as plarmed, an Oakland to Down-
town corridor, an Oakland circuit or a Down-
town to the Pittsburgh International Airport
route will be ready for construction in the
next two to three years, Megan Dardanell,
spokeswoman for Allegheny County, said.

She said she didn’t know whether or not
the connector would be included in Pitt stu-
dents’ transportation fees. '

“This [new line of transportation] may or
may not include Port Authority,” Dardanell
said.

The three routes being considered would
be along Centre Avenue, Second Avenue and
Colwell Street/Fifth Avenue. a

At this point, not one option is suggested
over another, Dardanell said. ‘ "

Onorato, a candidate for governor in this
year’s election, said the Partnership hopes to

move on with its plan in spite of the state of '

the economy.
“In an environment of limited public dol-
lars, we must be creative and innovative in

order to expand transit and improve mobility
in and between southwestern Pennsylvania’s
two largest economic centers,” Onorato said
in a press release.

The plan is still in its early stages, Darda-
nell said, “but it’s a very real thing.”

The transportation team is still in its re- *

search stages. It is determining which cor-
ridor will be up and running ﬁrst, as well as
the type of transportation to be used — light
rail, rapid bus or elevated people mover. The
decision partly depends on who will sign onto
the private end of the partnership.

The team will only accept energy-con-
scious proposals. This doesn’t necessarily
exclude using buses, but the connector route
should reduce the number of cars on the road,
thus improving Pittsburgh-’s footprint, Dar-
danell said.

In return for private investors’ opportu-
nity to have a say in the process, Pittsburgh’s
city government will have rights to develop
the land of interest and earn revenue from
fares.

Onorato, who has expressed interest in
updating Pittsbu=rgh’s public transporta-
tion system since he was elected in 2004,
is currently lobbying for the state to enable
legislation for public—private partnerships,
according to Dardanell. There is currently
no law for this in Pennsylvania. I

Kent McGaughey, Pitt’s manager of trav-
el and transportation, was unable to com-
ment. _ .

More information on the project and pro-

spective investors can be found at pittsburgh-V

oaklandconnector.com. Members of the com-
munity will be able to leave comments on the
site by the end of April.

Engineering an Election

The plan was simple enough. Pitt student
Jason Bennettwas going to challenge and defeat
incumbent congressman Mike Doyle, D-14th
Ward, which covers Squirrel Hill, Point Breeze,
Swisshehn Park and Regent Square, in the up-
coming primary election. He just had to get on
the ballot ﬁrst. .

“We were running statistics on various can-
vassing techniques,” Bennett said. “We looked
at lists of registered Democratic'voters.” And
then Bennett and his campaign team went door
to door tryingto acquire the 1,000 signatures

, needed by March 9 for this prospective materi-

als engineer turned campaign engineer to be
put on the primaries ballot. “It’s a good experi-
ence because people were overall supportive
about the idea of having someone else run,”
Bennett said of his door-to-door canvassing.
Bennett also experi-

me, ‘If you’re going to do it, take it seriously.”’
And that’s just what Bennett did. '

Though registering Independent before
the election, Bennett made the switch to the
Democrat Party so that he could run against
Doyle. “I don’t associate myself with a party,”
Bennett said. His campaign team represents
that theme. Democrats, Republicans, Inde-

' pendents and a Socialist, Carl Pjader, have all

joined Bennett’s campaign. All the members of
Bennett’s campaign team are volunteers and
most are Pitt students. .
In addition to canvassing Bennett and his

team also tabled in the lobby of the Litchﬁeld
Towers several times as part of their campaign

plan. Freshman Andrew Mozdy Bennett’s chief \

of staff admitted that the student response
was not strong. “We would’ve tried to build up
more of a studentbase,” Mozdy said of possible
campaign improvements. ‘

Despite the efforts of the Bennett campaign
team, it failed to achieve the 1,000 signatures
necessary to make it on to the ballot. He

Internet to make

the 2020’s roar  

0 keep pace with the rest

l of the world, The United
States has to think fast.

The United States ranks 18th in

Internet speeds among industrial-

ized nations, according to CNN,

with South Korea and Japan lead’-

ing the race. South Korea has an

average data transfer speed of 14.6

' megabits persecond and the U.S.,

a paltry 3.9.

These ﬁgures might change in
the future, and at ﬁrst glance, it
seems for the better.

The Federal Communications
Commission revealed some details

of its broadband plan yesterday, -«

according to CNN. It intends to
use educational programs» and
an expansion of infrastructure to
give 90 percent of Americans ac-

cess tp high-speed Internet at home I

by 2020, compared to 65 percent
currently. The FCC’s deﬁnition of
high-speed is greater than 768 ki-
lobits persecond.

The FCC is an independent agen-
cy formally charged with regulating
interstate and international com-
munications by radio, television,
satellite, wire and cable.

According to the Communica— _

tions Act of 1934, under which the
FCC was established, the agency
is responsible for providing rapid,
efﬁcient nationwide and worldwide.
communication. The FCC’s Internet
plan is fully in accord with its pur-
pose. However, that purpose might
have some implications.

The FCC ﬁnds current accessibil-
ity a detriment to economic growth.
It is plain to see that creating the
necessary infrastructure would cre-

ate jobs, invigorate rural regions

and put America on the fast track
to competing in the global market.
The beneﬁts are easily understood,
but the need might not be.

Has Internet, speciﬁcally high-
speed Internet, become a right for
every American? Similar to public
library access in past generations,
it seems Internet has permeated
American culture enough to be-

come a basic, need. The plan isn’t
for dial-up, it’s for broadband. Al-
though it is yesterday’s privileged
Internet class, broadband boasts
considerably faster connection
than its dial—up counterpart and
thus proves an acceptable new stan-
dard for U.S. high-speed Internet.

. Much of information exchange
today, including pertinent medical
and government information, is
accessible via the Web.

_ Technology has a structure and
function relationship. Each depend
on the other. When Windows 95 was
released, the average processor was
about 200Mhz, roughly .0.2Ghz.-
Now Windows 7 has in part justiﬁed

new lines of multicore, .multigiga--

hertz processors.

. Internet sites have also evolved A

from pages of text to multimedia
collages. Browsing with multiple
sidebars and ‘ options for video
requires fast Internet from the
start.

Cable or DSL might be sufﬁcient
and efficient now, but ﬁiture Inter-
net accessibility will have to keep up
with the data loads advanced tech-
nology will demand, as before.

Today’s technological circum-
stances have made the distinction
for “high-speed” Internet a nec-
essary one in the FCC’s plan. But
there is a limit to how much can
be gained from progress. Although
the 18th ranking shows a need for
improvement, it is hard to imagine
using 1000 megabits—per-second
speeds.

These infrastructure‘ expan-
sions by 2020 should probably be
observed with a hint of prudence.
The FCC formally regulates some
forms of communication. Perhaps

, its hand in providing access to 25

percent more Americans will give
the agency a stronger say in matters
of the Internet.

The traditionally unbound,
mildly regulated form of com-
munication might see a stronger
government hand guiding its way
in the ﬁiture.

the simpler plotlines that featured

-- spiky-haired Calvin and his sarcastic

mother and pelting neighborhood

The ﬁlm, titled “Dear Mr. Wat-

So far, the donations have
amounted to more than $21,000,
exceeding the project’s $12,000

goal. The excitement for the ﬁlm is.

Apart from the cornic’s lush illus-

The son of a patent lawyer, ‘Wat-

years, refusing to allow the kid and

The cartoonist never went on
tours or book signings, preferring to

sneak autographed copies of “Calvin

the Cleveland, Ohio, area.
Watterson abruptly ended the

editor stating that he felt the car-
toon had run its course. Apart from

When he put the strip away, he
meant it.

The demand for the strip was still
high in 1995 —. and is even high today
— but Watterson wanted to end it
before his work grew stale. If he had
kept hammering awayfor another de-
cade, he feared his characters would
lose their veracity — fans would get
bored and move "on. '-

I . By ending his strip on a high note,
' his characters have effectively transi-

today because Watterson’s elusive re-
ﬁrement gave it time to resonate. The
real story of the strip isn’t its creator
but the way it has matured with its
original audience.

By saying less, Watterson allowed

us to see more.
In Watterson’s last panel, Calvin

V and Hobbes toboggan off together

into a clean white oblivion while Cal-
vin cries, “Let’s go exploring!”

It’s a trumpet call to move on with
life, to stayin the present, to let things
fade and others grow, to see what else
is out there — to letthings go intime’s
natural progression. ,

Graphic novel readers areprobably
used to seeing the name Christopher
Moeller on bookshelves, but a new
exhibit Downtown, “Off the Page,”
features Moellerasanarﬁstaswellas
an author.

Moeller said hewas always afan of
art, but it was during his sophomore
year of high school that he decided to
join the discipline.

“In 10th grade, I was exposed to
students preparingtheir portfolios for
college, and it really excited me. After-
ward, I really began working toward
becoming an artist,” he said.

It wasn’t an easy road. Moeller
eamedaBFAatthe University ofMichi-
gan and went on to graduate school at
Syracuse University for illustration.

“On'e of my mentors after college
told me it might takeﬁve years to ﬁnd
work. I was a young hotshot and didn’t
believe him  and it ended up taking
me almost exactly ﬁve years,” Moeller
laughed. T .

But during that time off, Moeller

wasn’tjust sittingaroundwatchinghis ,

paint dry-
“The whole time I was waiting, I
wasn’t just  I was working on

my portfolio, looking for opport1mi— I

ties to get my work in front of people,”
he said.

Thoughartcanbeanunsteadypur—
suit, Moeller never wavered.

‘There is aclearpathforward, even
though it doesn’t seem like it. Geta job
thatwon’ttakeup allyourtime and en-
erg but will allow you to survive and
keepworkingonyourcrafr.Youwillget
little windows of opportunity, and you
need to jump on them,” he said.

Thathe did, andin1990, nineyears
after completing his undergraduate
work, Moeller wrote and illustrated a
graphic novel for Innovation Comics
called “Rocketman: King of the Rock-
etmen.” This was his ﬁistprofessional
endeavor, and things really began to
take off, so to speak, for Moeller.

Moeller has done work for Dark
Horse Comics, Caliber Comics and DC
Comics, according to his website. He
has done more than 100 illustrations
for the trading card game, “Magic: the
Gathering,” and has also done illustra-
tions for another trading card game
based on “World ofwarcraft”

Currently, Moeller writes and pro-
duceshis owncomics, called“Iron Em-
pires.” He has thus far published two
such graphic novels titled _“Faith Con-
quers” and“Sheva’s War,” accordingto
his site. He’s also published three com-

ics with pre-established characters.

It seemed like Moeller was doing
itall—--hewasworl<ingartisticallyin
comics and games and even doing a
lot of But then he gotaunique
offerthat Moeller, ever—readytotakean
opportunity, grateﬁilly accepted.

Sonja Sweterlitsch, curator_at the
709 Penn Gallery, was familiar with
Moeller’s work and asked him to put
together an exhibit. . e -

“She had asked me to jury a show

forthe Pittsburgh CulturalTrustawhile A

back, and wetalked. Her husband isfa-
miliar with my comics,” Moeller said.
Soon after, Moeller found himself
among the “hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds” of paintings in his stu-
dio, tryingto decide which paintings to
include injwhatwould/behisﬁistgallery
show since he was an undergrad.
“Iwantedtoinclude some of myper—
sonal work and also show some comic

work and gamingwork. And thatwas ,

enough to ﬁll the gallery,” he said.
Art may not be a sure shot as a
career, but Moeller has proved that

nscn ANALYSIS

The Apple iPadfaces ‘Slate’ competition

Computer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard argues its upcoming tablet alternative, called the Slate, ‘will dominate the market.

 
    
 

Donald Campbell
Columnist

A few months ago, Apple ofﬁcially
announced the development of a
new tablet device called the iPad,
and just last week, HP announced
its rival product — the Slate.
Apple’s plan, as described by
some, would revolutionize the
way users interface with a com-

puter — many would no longer
require a laptop. The plan also has
its critics, some of whom describe
it as an oversized iPod with few
redeeming qualities.

Either way, most of the initial
press treated it as a unique de-
vice with no real competition in
its marketplace. Recent motions
by both Hewlett-Packard and
Microsoft have challenged this
outlook.

Aimed at directly competing-

with the iPad, HP has grown vo-
cal about its own in-development
tablet. HP insists that its tablet has
been in development longer and
is superior to the iPad.

A recent New York Times
article suggests HP is raising a
surprisingly vast stink over its
new product. Many believe it is
merely a ploy to capitalize on the
ﬁrst generation iPad’s already-

identiﬁed weaknesses and will
ultimately come to nothing.
According to HP, the device,
known as “Slate,” has been in
development since before Apple
officially announced the iPad.

It will sport a similar physical
look and feel while attempting
to imitate the performance and.
features of a laptop, including run-
ning Windows 7. HP hopes that the
desktop operating system, com-

plete with the Flash support and
multitasking features users have
come to- expect, will ultimately
beat the iPad. I .

The‘iPad has shunned Flash

» support as too resource heavy and
- runs a modiﬁed iPod operating '

system ‘with only limited multi-

tasking support.

ily the pro -Apple lobby, have been

from HP.

Until recently, HP had not fully
released speciﬁcations for the new
device. Many were content to label
the Slate “vaporware,” indicat-
ing HP will continue-to promise,
but will never actually deliver, the
Slate. ~ ‘ M’  *' '

Many believethat HP will not
be able to create a device that is
as efﬁcient or as streamlined as
Apple’s iPad while maintaining.
Flash and multitasking support
through Windows 7. T 1

Another layer of reality came
to the iPad challenge on March 8,
however, when HP successfully
demoed the Flash supportfeatures
of the Slate. ' " _ .

It is well known that when

stands a very goodlchance of

failing to turn a proﬁt.

If Apple is indeed worried for
its new product, users might be
less worried for Apple.-

’f A perusal of comments on the
New York Times article shows that
many who initially liked the iPad

remain loyal despite a threat from
HP. Some like the idea of having
a “simpler” device running the
iPod OS and would rather not have

erating system intended for the
desktop.

There was the healthy smat-
tering of those who would object
to any device designed to run
Microsoft Windows, especially

that ‘an HP demo proved the HP
concept legitimate. Those post-
ing comments continued to insist

that HP would ultimately fail to C
A mount a long—lasting challenge

to Apple’s iPad.

Many posters pointed out the
fact that upon Apple’s release of its
ﬁrst iPhone, users objected to the
device’s design and OS features.

Apple addressed many of these
criticisms in future iterations of
the device and, despite early rab-
ble-rousing, managed to produce
a thoroughly popular, successful
and proﬁtable product.

Perhaps the demos and the fact
that HP has been uncharacteristi-
cally assertive in its announce-
ments regarding the Slate will ul-
timately prove to be early signs of
the iPad’s doom. .

Perhaps HP’s rumblings are
side effects of HP attempting to
push an underdeveloped product
against Apple’s solution that is al-
ready scheduled for release.

HP’s behavior is, certainly,
a sign that Apple is in for some

criticism of its iPad design deci- ’

sions. Only time will tell if Apple.
will falter or ‘triumph and if the
iPad will prove to be a long-lasting
commercial success. ‘

The men’s basketball team hopes to hit the court stronger in this year ’s_ first round than it did in last year ’s. L

Diana Eonnor | SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Gilbert Brown said his team shouldn’t take its opening-round match-
_ up against the Oakland Golden Grizzlies lightly.

 

Tonyjovenitti
Staﬂ’ Wri ter

One year after their most success-
ful season in recent memory, the
Panthers ﬁnd themselves in an
eerily similar situation.

Last year, Pitt earned a double-
bye in the Big East tournament by
way of a strong regular season but
lost in the ‘quarterfinals to West

S Virginia and left the Big Apple with

a whimper.

That didn’t affect Pitt’s seeding
as it earned a No. 1 seed for the ﬁrst
time in school history, and the loss
gave the team a week off before
its ﬁrst—round game against East
Tennessee State. '

But despite the week off, Pitt
struggled against East Tennessee
— the Panthers were only up by
two points with 4:27 remaining in

, the game. The Panthers managed

to survive and defeat ETSU.72—62
and Oklahoma State 84-76 in the
second round two days later.
This ‘year, Pitt faces the same
obstacles. ’ —
The Panthers once again bowed
out of the Big East tournament

Thursday after earning a double— .

bye — this year losing to a surging

Notre Dame. .
.But the Panthers still nabbed

a No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tourna-

ment and will travel to Milwau-

kee-to face No. 14—seed Oakland
Friday.

That gives Pitt more than a week
off, much like it had last year when
it struggled against ETSU.

But Pitt head coachjamie Dixon
said he is certain the Panthers will
be ready.

He avoided comparisons to
last year and said the week off
isn’t why the Panthers struggled
against ETSU.

Dixon repeated his statements
from a year ago when he said ETSU
was a good team and it deserved
more than a-No. 16 seed. Though,

the selection committee must not '

have listened, as ETSU is again a
No. 16 seed this season and will
face No. 1 Kentucky Thursday.

Dixon said he is simply focused
on improving. '

“We’ve got a couple good prac-
tices in this week, and we can im-
prove this week,” he said.

Brad. Wanamaker played an
important role on last season’s
team, and he echoed his coach by
saying the week off isn’t why Pitt
struggled against ETSU.

“It’s just something that hap-

pened,”Vhe said. “ETSU was just a.

great team.” '

Still, he is determined to stay
sharp throughout this week, be-
cause “Oakland is a good team,
too.”. ‘

“Coach Dixon has us scrim-

maging,” Wanamaker said. “We
are motivated to get back on that
court after losing.”

Gary McGhee said the recent

practices keep the team inlthe right '

frame of mind.
“We have been scrimmaging to
keep the feel of things, and it was

7 just like a game,” McGhee said.

This might be a younger team
than last year’s, but Dixon and
some of the returning players
bring valuable experience.from
last year. Familiarity with the situ-
ation entering the NCAA Tourna-
ment might give them an edge that
Dixon is determined to use to his
advantage. _ ‘

“We have the opportunity to get
better at some things,” Dixon said.
“We can _be as good as we want to
be.”

_If ETSU taught the Panthers
anything, it’s not to overlook the
ﬁrst round.

Regarding the West Region,
Dixon said he didn’t even know
who Pitt would play after Oak-
land. E

Gilbert Brown was also on last
year’s team, and he will also take

that experience and learn from
it. ‘

“We need to maintain focus this
week,” he said.

He then gave his team some
advice: “Don’t take Oaklaad
lightly.”.

ANALYSIS

March16, 2o1o I TheiPi_tt News I wWW.pittneWs.com

For a perfect NCAA bracket, take some advice  

Don’t commit the average mistakes — make use of a few tricks to best predict the Tournament.

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

 

Shortly after the NCAA Tournament
begins, some low-seeded mid—major
will beat up on a Final Four contend-
er, and you will get a text message,
a call or a nudge from the person
sitting next to you.

“Lehigh’s winning,” that per-
son will say. “I so have that in my
pool.”

Don’t be that guy.

In the fervor of March Madness’s
first round, it’s easy to get lost in
the commotion as high-deﬁnition
basketball is blasted in our face
for four daysystraight.,Nonethe-
less, this year, follow a few simple
rules to maintain proper bracket
etiquette. ’

S First, don’t count your ﬁrst—
round upsets before they hatch.

Little does Mr. Lehigh know, the
top—seeded powerhouse will soar
back in the second half. On the off
ghance that it doesn’t, Mr. Lehigh

will become more and more animat-
ed. The excitement that he is about
to earn two points in‘ his bracket
pool will overtake him. -

This leads to the second guide-A

line: Try to pick the champion, not
the ﬁrst—round surprise.

Sure, it’s awesome to brag to
your friends that you had Vermont
over Syracuse or Virginia Com-
monwealth over Duke. But what
really mattered were your hastily-
assembled Final Four picks of Texas
A&M, Oklahoma State, Wake Forest
and Radford.

Most pools weigh the scoring '

so that the latter rounds count
exponentially more than the ﬁrst.

Still, many people spend their lunch‘

breaks fretting over that No. 8 vs.
No. 9 seed matchup instead of who
emerges from the region. If you pre-
dict the champion, you usually win
the bracket — even if Mr. Lehigh’s
lucky guess blindsides you.
Guideline three: Just pay the
man. ’ ~
Some brackets have money in-
volved. Sometimes the winner just

gets a big sash with albutton that
says “I’m a champion!” on it. No
matterwhat’s'at stake, do your com-
missioner a favor and pay him right

. now if you haven’t already. Nobody

likes hunting a friend down for the
entry fee. ,
Guideline four: Be consistent.

ESPN, Yahoo!, CBS and ahandful V.
of other websites run bracket com-
.petitions that offer big prizes. On

top of that, invitations into friends’
groups will linger in your inbox. You

might be tempted to diversifyyour‘
portfolio, selecting different upsets ‘
and different Final Foursfor each

pool. This, though, is bush league.
' Mr. Lehigh actually has Lehigh
in one out of four of his brackets.

He has Kansas making it to the Fi- T

nal Four in another bracket, and
the Jayhawks as the champion in
another. ’ _ _ .

If you mix it up with each brack-
et, you’re saying to yourself that you
never really believed in the upset
in the ﬁrst place. Pick your teams
and stick with them. Maybe even
buy a shirt.

has numerous opportunities

Guideline ﬁve: Don’t be like ev-
erybody else. i_

March Madness is big business‘.
It’s so big of a business that it causes
real business to grind to a halt '—
to the tune of $1.8. billion in the

. p'_I‘ou'rnamen_t’s first week alone, ac-
-cording to the_Seattle Times. ESPN
l broadcasts a pg/_vo—hour» program to

help you ﬁll out your bracket. There
are magazines for your beneﬁt ——

‘even Kabbalah-like books about the
‘ emerging’ patterns iiithe Tourna-

ment.- ' ~ -.

« With th'at'said, don’t‘ listen to .

them. They are usuallyivrong. Don’t

listen to my picks, either, because ’

. they’re usually wrong,/too.
Statistically speaking, statistics 

mean‘ nothing. All four No. 1 seeds

never make the Final Four — except
in 2008. A No. 12 seed always beats
a No. 5 — except in 2007. .

. Nobody really knows who “this
year’s George Mason” will be. If you

follow the crowd and blindly agree
with the popular upsets, you lose a
lot of the fun.

Take someadvice from i96os'

British rock and don’t be like ev-
erybody else. Pick a team nobody
else has going anywhere. If that
team wins, you’ll feel really good.
If it loses, so What? _ . . . ' T

Guideline -six: Have your com-

puter handy. ‘ . ‘ ‘ — ’
With 32~.games crammed into
two days, CBSiputs the scores of the
regional broadcasts at the top of the
screen on a nifty little ‘black ‘ban-

. ner. It’s abeautiful thing mostof the '
time —— untilyour No. 15 seed one- ‘
. chance-in-a—thAousand upset game

tips off. You stop paying attention to
‘the game infront of youand instead
squint at the tiny white font.
Your heart skips a’-beat when you
misread “19-10” as “19-18.” The

score doesn’_t change .for minutes _

at a time. CBS goes to commercial,

‘and when it returns, Cinderella’s
' deﬁcit has suddenly been halved.
,, When will Greg Gumble cut inl?

‘ It’s best just to have your com-
puter at the ready, so you can watch
Cinderella’s nail biter inits entirety.

— Just don’t act like Mr. Lehigh when
‘ it’s close. m ‘
