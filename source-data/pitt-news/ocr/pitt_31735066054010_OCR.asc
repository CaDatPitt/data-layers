RD denies knowledge ofKA‘I’ pledge beatings

,°"v ‘C ._

 

The parents of a student injured in a
Kappa Alpha Psi hazing incident last
year are calling for the suspension of
Lothrop Hall’s resident director, claim-
ing that he had knowledge of the beat-
'ings but did nothing to prevent them.

Last spring, ﬁve Kappa Alpha Psi
brothers repeatedly “spanked” pledge
members with a wooden board until
two of them had to be hospitalized with
kidney damage.

Criminal charges were brought
against those who participated in the

beatings, but Byron Woodson, Sr., the
father of a pledge beaten in the incident,
is now claiming that Linwood Harris, a
member of Kappa Alpha Psi and current
resident director of Lothrop Hall, knew
about the the beatings beforehand, but
made no move to stop them.

“I’m not saying Linwood Harris par-
ticipated in the beatings, but he knew
they were taking place,” Woodson said.
“My son and another pledge went to
Harris for help. Harris was a Pitt
employee and a mentor [to these stu-
dents], yet he absolutely tumed his head

when eight Pitt students were being

savagely brutalized.”

Harris, a Pitt graduate student, was
working in the Ofﬁce of Admissions
and Financial Aid when the hazing took
place. He admits being an active mem-
ber of the alumni chapter of Kappa
Alpha Psi, but denies having had prior
knowledge that the attacks would occur.

“I had no knowledge that the pledges
were getting that kind of abuse,” Harris
said. “Some pledges came to me before
they rushed so that I could vouch for
their character to the other fraternity
members. That was all.” _ ‘

Woodson, whose son now lives in
Lothrop, maintains that his son and

hazing incidents, and that Harris did
nothing to help them. Woodson said this
is why he feels Harris is unﬁt to preside

- over the students at Lothrop Hall.

“Harris was a Pitt employee in the
ﬁnancial aid office, but completely dis-
regarded the health and welfare of Pitt
students,” Woodson said. “He has
proven himself unworthy, and has no
business being responsible for the safe-
ty of hundreds of students in [Lothrop
Ha1l].”

So far, Pitt administration has denied
Woodson’s requests to have Harris
removed from his duties.

The largely unheard fresh-
man opinion will now have a
larger voice thanks to the new
Freshmen Government.

The Freshmen
Government will replace the
Freshmen Council as the
class’s representative in the
Student Government Board
[SGB]. The new organization
will continue to work closely
with SGB, but is now a sepa-
rate organization.

“The biggest problem with
the old Freshmen Council was
that it didn’t represent the
freshman class,” said Student
Government Board member
Marc Friedberg, whose idea it
was to restructure the

Freshmen Council. “The
Student Government Board
doesn’t know everything that
affects a freshman.”

The new Freshmen
Government will consist of a
president, vice president,

business manager, secretary,
and five executive members
who will oversee five commit-
tees.

The five committees are:
Policy and Regulation,
Strategical Planning, Social

Program, Internal Affairs, and

another committee which will
be decided on at a later time.
The old Freshmen Council
that was a branch of the
Student Government Board
had approximately 50 fresh-
men apply every year, and
only nine of those would be

other pledges went to Harris about the

picked to serve on it,
explained Friedberg. They
also had no set responsibili-
ties, he said.

“We’re trying to create a
miniature
Government Board for fresh-

men,” said Friedberg.
“Eventually I would like to
see the SGB constitution

change so that the Freshmen
Government President could
sit on the board.”

The first president will be
elected by the current
Freshmen Government. In the
future, Friedberg hopes that
the president will ‘be elected
by the entire freshman” class.

tion, freshmen voiced con-

The Student Government Board will be operating with a
few cards short of a full deck in the next, few weeks.

No, the board has not gone insane. But they are missing a
few colleagues since board members Lee Bannister, Keith
Campbell, and Robert Goode armounced their resignations last
week.

Lee Bannister, who was the SGB’s business manager,
resigned in a letter addressed to the student community. He
emphasized that tension with the board did not prompt his res-
ignation.

' “I arrived at this decision not because of any discord or
disagreement, but because of personal matters that will require
my full attention for the remainder of my term,” Bannister said.

Keith Campbell, who was recently appointed as Student
Liaison to the Department of Education, will be residing in
Washington D.C. this semester. He said the decision to leave
the SGB was a difficult one.

“I’ve agonized all summer over this. But it was a question
of where I can do the most good,” Campbell said.

Campbell was instrumental in organizing last year’s “Save
Student Aid” rally on the "Cathedral lawn, which featured Vice
President Al Gore. ’

Robert Goode could not be reached for comment, but
SGB President Andrew Wuertele said that Goode resigned for
“personal reasons.”

The three positions on the nine-member board will remain
unﬁlled until the SGB can complete the selection process for
new board members.

Italy; O..l.returns to court

Around the World

BAGHDAD — The caution of its
Persian Gulf allies has cast doubts in the
United States’ potential capability to
quickly launch signiﬁcant military oper-
ations against Iraq.

Defense Secretary William Perry
visited Kuwait Sunday to seek approval
for the dispatch of thousands‘ of U.S.
troops to strengthen forces on Iraq’s
southern border, but left with only a
promise that the request would be con-
sidered.

This development came as the
United States struggled to mass Army,
Air Force, and Navy forces against Iraqi
dictator Saddam Hussein in a Persian
Gulf region that appears increasingly
uneasy with the effort.

The cautiousness of -the Persian
Gulf allies is certain to brew political
problems for President Clinton as he
attempts to manage the Iraq confronta-
tion in the middle of a presidential elec-
tion campaign. Pittsburgh Post Gazette

VENICE — Waving the barmers of the
yet-mythical -state of Padenia, Italy’s
small but ﬂamboyant secessionist move-
ment steamed into Venice on Sunday.
This action stepped up its improbable
challenge to Italian unity with a mix of
medieval and political pageantry.
Borrowing phrases from the
American Declaration _of Independence,
Umberto Bossi, the leader of the move-

ment, delivered a tirade against the
“colonialists” in Rome who, he said,
have robbed northern Italy of its hard-
eamed money and its cultural identity.

However, the mood of the event was
more like a small—town party than a sep-
aratist rebellion. Despite the low
turnout, political leaders are going all-
out to stop Bossi’s bid. The New York
Times

Simpson is back on trial today.- This

both new evidence and a more stream-

long the criminal trial to nine months.

the topic of discussion, this was an
informal lecture on managed care led
by Michael DeVita, co-chairman of
the committee.

“The purpose of this series is to
help better educate the doctors, staff,
and the entire medical community on
ethical issues that are happening in the
community,” said DeVita.

During the lecture, DeVita dis-
cussed some of the incentives of man-
aged care over fee—for-service care.
Another question raised during’ the
lecture was if and how doctors’ care
has changed with the ongoing devel-
opments in health care.

After hearing about a medical
case, DeVita and others would discuss
some of the ethical issues that con-
cerned the case —- such as whether
patients should be notified if their
insurance coverage is about to run out.

Other issues that were addressed
and will be addressed again in future
lectures included questions about

what measures should be taken to a

keep a patient alive when there is no
hope of recovery, how much say the
family should have in these decisions,
and when hospital staff should inter-

Oakland merchant works to beautify surroundings

Erin Brennan

 

If you’re looking for someone in
Oakland who knows a thing or two
about men’s clothing, then Larry
Dashefsky, owner of Leonard’s Men’s
Shop on Forbes Ave., is the man to talk
to. ’

And if you’re wondering who is
trying to create a more friendly and
beautiful Oakland, Larry Dashefsky is
still your man.

Dashefsky, 49, grew up in Oakland
and has worked at Leonard’s Men’s
Shop since 1964.

He was also elected president of the
Oakland Civics and Business

Association (OCBA) in January, which
has quadrupled its membership in the
last year.

“The OCBA is a group comprised
of local Oakland businesses trying to
improve the overall climate of the com-
munity for everyone,” Dashefsky said.

About a year ago the OCBA helped
those in need in Oakland by developing
the “Change for the Better” campaign.
Coin collecting cans soon were placed
in local shops throughout Oakland to
raise money for the poor and homeless
in the area.

“Instead of giving money directly
to the needy out on the streets, we give
the money collected in the cans to one
organization who is in charge of helping

the needy,” Dashefsky said.

In January the “Change for the
Better” campaign changed into a fund-
raiser for Kevin Cecil that raised
$28,000.

The OCBA is currently promoting
Pitt athletics by entering customers in
drawings for free tickets to every home
football game.

Dashefsky also said the OCBA is
working with local architects to develop
ways to beautify Oakland by planting
ﬂowers in specific places around the
stores, building a sign welcoming all
who come to Oakland, and separating
the shopping areas from the residential
areas.

The OCBA also created Oakland

have sidewalk sales for a few days dur-

For all the problems in the area,
Dashefsky said that he has never
thought of moving his own store out of
Oakland because of the relationships
he’s formed with customers.

“[The store] is a landmark and an
integral part of Oakland. People in the
area come to Oakland expecting to see
Leonard’s Men’s Shop,” said
Dashefsky. “I’ve seen children grow up
to have families of their own, and I have
made lifelong friends.”

Dashefsky had very little criticism
for Oakland, and described the area as
“a city within a city with rich culture
and opportunities.”

“Oakland is very unique,”
Dashefsky said. “We do have so many
different cultures in one area.”

In the coming months, the OCBA
will begin discussing and working on
plans to make Oakland more festive for
the fall and winter holidays.

 

  mom PAGE 1

Dennis Donham, assistant vice-chan-
cellor of student affairs, said he has
looked into the matter, but has found no
need to suspend or remove Harris from
his position at Lothrop Hall.

“At this time" my investigation has
not shown that Linwood Harris has
done anything wrong,” Donham said.
“I have looked into Harris’ role in the
fraternity and have concluded to the
best of my knowledge that he was not
aware of any hazing at Kappa Alpha
Psi.”

Jo Ann ‘Woodson, director of the
office of residence life, said that Harris’
membership with the fraternity does
not associate him with the beatings at
all.

“It’s like saying that a person living
in Philadelphia is partly responsible for
a crime committed by someone living
in Pittsburgh just because they are both
residents of Pennsylvania,” she said.

Byron Woodson said he feels
“shrugged off’ by the University’s han-
dling of his requests, and that he is
unsatisfied with the outcome of previ-
ous investigations.

“I simply was not satisfied by the
investigation in April after my son was
hospitalized,” Woodson said. “I am not
requesting that Harris be ﬁred or not
paid. Pitt can make him football coach
for all I care. It’s just that Linwood
Harris would not be responsible for
Lothrop Hall.”

Harris said he met with Woodson
about the incident last spring, and that
he had hoped the issue had been
resolved then.

Fulbright applicants try for education in global esearch

Hillary Stevenson

 

a:». :1?

Researching and writing a master’s
thesis or doctoral dissertation can often be
a challenging and lengthy process. It can be
an even greater challenge if the research
material needed can only be found in
another country.

One grant aimed at providing assis-
tance to those in these situations is the
Fulbright Grant Program.

The Fulbright Program, founded by
former Arkansas Sen. J. Wrlliarn Fulbright
in 1946, is designed to aid graduate and
doctoral students with research they have
to do overseas. It is sponsored by the
Institute of International Education located
in New York. The grants provide for round-
trip transportation, tuition, and mainte-
nance for one academic year.

“[The Fulbright] is for academically
strong students, who have valid research
proposals that they carmot study here in the
United States,” explained Annagene Yucas,
who advises Pitt students that are applying
for the grant.

While most recipients are graduate or
doctoral students of history, education,
anthropology, or political science, some
students in art, music, and theatre have also
received a Fulbright.

Yucas said that she receives an average
of 20 to 25 applications each year and that
about ‘six students from Pitt receive a
Fulbright. The number of grants given each

year vary according to individual areas of

the world.
Yucas said those involved in the selec-
tion process seek out the students who will

,“ﬁmction we ” in a global environment

and who will give back what they gained
from the Fulbright experience, perhaps
through teaching, when they return home.
The Fulbright is also intended to have its
recipients act as academic ambassadors to
the different countries of the world.

“The idea behind the Fulbright is to
foster a scholarly exchange among
nations,” said Jerome Crowder, a Pitt doc-
toral student who received a grant in 1994
to study medical anthropology in El Alto,
Bolivia.

Crowder went on to say that recipients

guistics prolessor, will be held on

are put in a liaison-type position between
America and the country they visit. They
are like ambassadors. They may be there
primarily to study and conduct research,
but they also teach their hosts about
Americans.

“It is a chance to see that we all have
three basic needs — food, shelter, and a
good family,” he said.

The application process for a Fulbright
takes an average of one year. The ﬁrst step
is to compose a personal narrative and to
describe one’s proposal for study, that is,
the reason for traveling. Students cannot
say they wish to go to a country just for the
sake of visiting it.

According to Yucas, applicants have to
“justify the essentiality of being there.”

Next, applicants are interviewed by a
committee at Pitt before having their port-
folios sent to a national screening commit-
tee. The last hurdle to cross is a screening
by a committee made up of individuals
from the country the student wishes to trav-
el to.

According to Yucas, candidates need
to have letters of recommendation from
previous professors and advisors, letters of
support from contacts in their preferred
country, and a strong knowledge of the
country’s language, history, and culture.

. “Students should be able to land in a
country running,” she said.

Some applicants have said the biggest
challenge is in the initial stages of the appli-
cation.

“It is difficult to put my ideas for my
proposal into just two pages,” said Jamie
Sanders, a history student who wishes to do
dissertation research in Columbia.

Other students echoed similar con-
cerns.

“It is a lot of work to get the proposal
ready. Right now, I am more focused on
meeting the deadlines, [such] that I haven’t
entertained the possibility of getting [the
grant],” said Helen Boyle, a doctoral candi-
date in education and anthropology, who
hopes to study in Morocco.

Crowder suggests that applicants,
“write, write,‘ and rewrite” their proposals.
“You can’t just [reduce] the font to make
everything ﬁt [on the page]. It’s about
being succinct,” he said.

Relations Chair Beth Wasel has not
retumed to Pitt, leaving her position unﬁlled
as well.

With three resignations in one week,
the board has been thrown a little olf track.
President Wuertele said some projects have
been diﬂicult to complete and many loose
ends need to be tied up.

But Wuertele said he sees the open
positions as a positive development for the
SGB.

“All three board members have ﬁlled
very important roles,” Wuertele said. “But
we look at this as an opportunity to
strengthen the boar .”

New board members will be selected

dents who are non—CGS undergraduates are
eligible for the positions. Applications are
available in the SGB oﬁice in room 639 of
the William Pitt Union and are due back by
Friday, Sept. 20 at 4:30 p.m. I
Although the new members’ terms of
oﬂice will last only until the end of the
semester (when SGB elections are held),
Wuertele feels the shorter terms will cause
the new members to be more focused and
accomplish a lot in a short amount of time.
“These new students will bring more
energy and vigor to this board,” he said.
Wuertele said he hopes to have the new
board members chosen by the end of

Freshmen  o

cerns over a variety of issues. Two
hot topics were new IDs and the
freshman social Greek rush policy.

Many at the meeting voiced
concern that the new IDs caused
back—ups getting into their build-
ings. One freshman said the new
swipe method is like a “river run-
ning through a narrow area.” They
were also concerned about fraud.
Several students have already had
their IDs stolen. '

Other freshmen complained
that the new rush policy, on which
a final decision will not be made
until Monday afternoon, was
unfair.

“We’re not even allowed to
hang out with brothers that we’re
already friends with because the
brothers are afraid that their house
will be accused of dirty rush,” said
Erik Wolfe, who’s running for
freshman president. “If we go to a
fraternity brother’s house, we have
to be out by 8 p.m. if there is a
mixer planned.- We’re in college
now; they shouldn’t be telling us

“Unfortunately they still feel anger
towards me,” Harris said. “I’m not sure
of the motive behind it. Maybe they

%

just want to implicate the school.”

Harris said he would continue on as
resident director at Lothrop, and main-
tains that his relationship with Kappa
Alpha Psi does not affect his job at
Lothrop.

“My personal affiliation will affect
my position as resident director,”
Harris said. “I make a very strong sep-
aration between the two aspects of my
life.”

Harris said he hopes the issue with
the Woodsons is resolved soon. ,

“I don’t bear any animosity towards
the Woodsons. I understand they are
angry,” Harris said. “But I went into
student services to help people gradu-
ate and have a well-adjusted time at
Pitt. The last thing I want is for any of
them to feel like they’re in jeopardy.”

Save student aid 

This afternoon, the Labor, Health, and Human Services
Committee education bill comes up for a vote in the U.S.
Senate. This bill proposes $3.1 billion in funding for educa-
tion.

This money will be used for Pell grants and Perkins
loans, both of which help many students at this campus
attend school.

In recent years, both the number of Pell grants and the
monetary value of each grant have been declining. There are

 

.a growing number of legislators in both the Senate and the

House of Representatives who feel that students should take
out loans rather than receive the help of governmental
grants. _ .

The average student on full ﬁnancial aid must still take
out $20,000 in loans. The timetable for paying back that
amount of borrowed money is $250 a month for 10 years. At
that rate, educated people with average salaries must wait to
purchase a house. For ﬁnancial reasons, starting families
must be put off. This means that even after graduating, one’s
life cannot necessarily begin until his financial burden is dis-
charged. = _

It is extremely disturbing that we are returning" to the
tirne when one’s birth into the caste system determines the
opportunities and advantages he will have in his life. If this
is true, then the American dream is dead. There is no hope
for anyone to attain more than his parents before him, as his
parents could not hope to achieve anything greater than their
parents before them. .

In the land of opportunity, we carmot allow this to hap-
pen. The burden is on our shoulders to tell our Senators that
we will not stand for education to become a privilege of the
rich instead of a right for the deserving. We must get on the
phone to Senators Specter and Santorum and demand that
the government take responsibility for this country’s future.

As thisbill is coming up for a vote today, there is no time
to waste in getting your voice heard. The numbers to call are:

Senator Arlen Specter — (202) 224-4254

Senator Rick Santorum — (202) 224-6324

Bill Clinton is the only logical choice

 

With the election just a few short
weeks away, the American people
will have to make an important
choice: Bill Clinton or Bob Dole? (Is
anyone voting for Perot?) From my
point of view, the choice is simple.

I was ecstatic when President
Clinton was elected in 1992, but I
quickly became disillusioned. As a
moderate Democrat and proud mem-
ber of the centrist Democratic
Leadership Council (which President
Clinton himself once chaired), I was
upset that the President seemed. to be
paying more attention to social issues
rather than to economic and foreign
policy issues, which I care a great
deal about. Following the 1994 elec-

_ tions, I was so upset thatl wrote a let-

ter to the editor

of the DLC’s magazine “The New
Democrat,” in which I questioned ﬂie
President’s ability to to lead the
Democratic party and the United
States. “It takes a strong hand to keep
the Democrats together,” I observed
in the letter, “and I fear that the
President just doesn’t have that
han 

So, what do I think of the
President now? V\’1ll I vote for him?
I’m happy to say that I was wrong
then, and I will be voting_for him
come November. Why?

In the latterhalf of his term, fol-
lowing the 1994 rr1id—terrn election,
President Clinton turned everything
around. While the media pontiﬁcated
about the allegedly imminent demise
of the Democratic party and the
Republicans congratulated them-
selves on their victory, gloating that

,Clinton was “inelevan ’ to govem-

to o n n.a-u»p.n-.c-.u».n- .-ma o<a..vuvn-pm .>- . v » a 4Cvc—V~.!QIa}.pﬁ.~C a .\-.4.<v».¢v.--..~--um.

ing, President Clinton became the
leader I had hoped him to be: smart,
shrewd, and decisive.

Realizing that he had been led
astrayby his liberal advisors in his
ﬁrst two years, President Clinton
began to work on the issues people
care about, instead of the issues that
the media says are important.
President Clinton courageously
worked to pass job-creating trade
pacts like NAFTA and GATT, even
though it alienated liberal groups like
labor unions. He fought Republican
attempts to pay oif wealthy contribu-
tors withtaxbreaksﬁnancedbytax
increases for the poor. He increased
the minimum wage and passed the
Family Leave Act, both of which
have given relief to working-class
families. It is odd for the Republicans
to whine that President Clinton has
“stolen” their ideas. Are they really so
hyper—partisan that they could possi-
bly call an issue theirs and theirs
alone?

President Clinton has taken
gutsy stands on foreign policy. He
boldly went against the polls and
bailed out the Mexican economy in
1995, preventing a disastrous col-
lapse of the Mexican govemment.
Despite dire warnings from pundits
that supporting Boris Yeltsin would
prove disastrous, President Clinton
helped Yeltsin win a second tenn as
Russian president and insured that
the bad old days of Cold War will
never return. Thanks to President
Bush’s disastrous decision to stop the
Persian Gulf War without totally
defeating Saddam Hussein, President
Clinton has been confronted with a
diﬁicult situation in the Gulf and has
still managed to keep the mad dicta-
tor in check. He sent troops to Bosnia

 

 

and Haiti despite low public opinion
ratings. You won’t hear the
Republicans who were screaming
alarmist predictions of a second
Vietnam admit this, but President
Clinton’s foreign policy has been a
major success.

But what of Bob Dole? The duty
of being the leader of the most pow-

erful nation on earth ages a man, and -

Dole would be, at age 73, our oldest
president.

Beyond the age issue, there is the
question of whether or not Dole truly
understands how the American peo
ple feel. He has been a creature of
Washington since 1961. His support-
ers may use code words like “family
values” to introduce President
Clinton’s personal life into the nation-
al debate, but it wasn’t Bill Clinton
who, in 1972, ﬂew across the country
to campaign for Republican candi-
dates, then retumed home and told
his ﬁrst wife simply: “I want out.”
Do1e’s lame attempts to show him-
self to be an average ciﬁzen after his
resignation from the Senate make it
fairly obvious that the political world
is the only world Dole knows.

Finally, there is the issue of
Dole’s ridiculous 15 percent tax cut,
which he proposed in a bid to win
votes this fall. In a dizzying switch,
Dole has sold out to the ﬂaky supply-
side theories of Jack Kemp and Steve
Forbes, which he himself once derid-
ed as a joke. It is a shame that such a
distinguished career as Dole’s must
end with such a disastrous campaign.

I’m pleased to say that President
Clinton deserves to be reelected and
can certainly count on my vote on
election day, Nov. 5.

Michael J. Berquist‘ is looking for-
ward to Nov. 5. ~

I reserve the right to hate Penn

left—wing lies. Last week, A column ran

esclay, September 1 7, ‘I996

then went on to label proposed reduc-

ou’ e all got to fight for your right to hate

 

It seems that over the past few
years, liberal intellectuals have been
inventing new “rights” that should be
extended to all Americans. Among these
are the right to health care and the right
to a college education, in addition to the
already existing right to kill partially-
born babies. So, while we’re in the
claiming—rights mood, I would like to
take this opportunity to reserve the right
to hate certain things and people. This
does not mean that I actually do loathe
these things — because conservatives
really are a loving bunch — only that I
should be given that right.

State. I not only claim this right because
they are a collection of arrogant hillbil-
lies, but because they also represent
what is wrong with much of our own
student body. People come here to be
students at Pitt, people go there to be
Nittany lions. They have a pride in their
school that our students "cannot compre-
hend. While they play football in front
of 90,000 people every home game, our
students hang out at the Beehive. It
would be excusable if we were a
respected academic institution, but let’s
face it, we’re not. There is currently
almost nothing to distinguish us from
local schools such as Clarion or IUP.

I reserve the right to hate continual

in this esteemed paper about Republican
“lies,” using mostly obscure and irrele-
vant inforrnation. It must be said that
liberals have written the book on politi-
cal lies. Since Democrats have no posi-
tive agenda, they have resorted to ridicu-
lous claims about Republican positions
on a variety of issues. Their favorite lie
is the “everything by the Republicans is
for a tax cut for the rich” story. When Al
Gore came to Pitt last year to defend stu-
dent loans, he claimed that the money
saved would go to only the wealthiest
Americans. Keep in mind, this was
before the Republicans even proposed
their budget, whose tax cut was mainly a
$500 per child tax break. Democrats

tions in the growth of Medicare as
Draconian cuts and slashes. I could
write an entire column on such lies, and
what is a shame is that the liberal media
allows Democrats to get away with say-
ing virtually anything they want.

I reserve the right to hate the outra-
geous name—calling that many conserva-
tives receive. According to many people,
Pat Buchanan is a Nazi, Newt Gingrich
is a fascist, and Dick Armey is a radical
extremist. I’m sorry, but trying to con-
trol the growth of government entitle-
ments and balance the budget is not
extremist. Our country existed for over
100 years without Medicare, Medicaid,

and Social Security, but now controlling.

runaway costs is extremist? In addition,
comparisons between modern conserva-
tives and fascist regimes of the past
couldn’t be more untrue. Republicans
generally believe in restricting_the size
and inﬂuence of the government and
returning control to the people, while
Nazi and fascist governments of the past
represented the epitome of big govern-
ment. Fascist nations exercise complete
control over their economies and citi-
zens in a communist—like fashion, which
is just the opposite of modern conser-
vatism.

I reserve the right to hate the way
our university spends money. Do our
administrators really think that new ID
cards and superﬂuous student activities

lead to a greater enrollment? Instead of -

spending funds on pathetic little frills,
we should build the proposed convoca-
tion center/basketball arena. There once
was a young boy from Texas whose first
college football memory was of Pitt
beating Georgia in the Sugar Bowl at the
end of the 1981 season. That boy con-
tinued to be a Pitt fan, and he is now a
senior at Pitt. The point of the story is
that prominent Pitt athletics was the
main reason I liked this university, and it
could again attract a large number of

students. Good academics and athletics ,

are the main draws for any major insti-

ytution, and these areas are where we

need to spend our money. »

Finally, I have compiled a collection
of things which I have also reserved the
right to hate. These include the follow-
ing: blowing 21 to 7 second quarter
leads, the people in PNC Bank,
Pittsburgh weather, the entire Clinton
administration, anyone who hates me for
being white or for being an American,
the Dallas Cowboys, the National
Education Administration and affirma-
tive action. And last but certainly not
least, I not only reserve the right to hate,
but I genuinely despise Hillary Clinton.
She is the sleazy, liberal mastermind
behind nearly all of the scandals that
have marked this current administration.

Matt Mills promises to be in a better
mood for his next article.-

THE PITT NEWS

 

This sure ain't no  

stairway to heaven

    

Hear my song yeah, people won ’t ya
listen now... . ..

Sing along, yeah...

And the song remains the same.

That little refrain of the Led
Zeppelin classic “The Song Remains the
Same” echoes the horrible travails of the
Pitt football team the last ﬁve years.

Hear my song...

Yeah, for the last ﬁve seasons, Pitt
fans have been duped into believing that
the football team is improving, scaling
from the depths‘ of hell to a happier
place, like the Hookah Bowl or any bowl
(four screens included with purchase).

Former Head Coach (and current
offensive mastermind at Kansas City)
Paul Hackett wreaked more havoc on the
program than the Grim Reaper. Hackett

' wielded his sickle, paying players $500

to wash his car and leaving the program
in shambles.
As Pitt’s guardian angel, Johnny

q Majors took over once again; fans

expected an instant turnaround. That
task was impossible. No way c'ould
Majors work enough magic to come full
circle (1976 National Champs) instantly.
Realistic fans hoped that Majors made
this team a winner by his third year.

This is his fourth year and the pro-
gram shows no signs of leaving hell, let
alone reaching purgatory.

Every year, we hear the same thing.

“I think the team took giant strides
in the off-season and this year we will
deﬁnitely see improvement.”

Sing along...

Each year, we buy the inﬂated
promises. , '

Last season, the Pitt players played
us like hoes. After the season-opening,
gut-wrenching victory against a solid
Washington State squad, the players
talked of a bowl game and the fans went
wild. .

Runners become children of the corn

 

Only in West Virginiacould a Big
East conference sporting event take a
back seat to a corn ﬁeld. ,

Last Saturday, the Pitt men’s and
women’s cross-country teams travelled to

the Mountaineer Invitational at West

Virginia University. The race had to be
extended by about 200 meters in order to
go around a corn ﬁeld that had been plant-
ed on the course. _

The Pitt men finished third of the four
teams in the meet. Ed Adamson led the
way for the Panthers, ﬁnishing fourth
overall with a time of 27:22.7 on the
8000—meter (about 5-rnile) course.

“Ed is running as weH as, if not better
than, anyone we had last year,” Sobal
said. “And everyone who was here last
year is doing better this year.”

One of those improving runners,
Scott Gilpen, was Pitt’s second ﬁnisher,
coming in at 12th place overall in

28:17.5. The 55-second gap between -

Adamson and Gilpen was all Virginia

Tech and West Virginia needed to take
control of the meet. Five Hokies and two
Mountaineers came. in between Adamson
and Gilpen. Virginia Tech won the meet
with 28 points. West Virginia followed
with 38, while Pitt had 70 and Duquesne
98.

Individually, West Virginia’s Mac
Knapp won the race with a time of
26:58.4. While it may not sound fast; it
wasn’t bad for the course, which was dif-
ﬁcult enough even without worrying
about the corn.

“It was a very tough course,” Sobal
said. “Only four people have ever gone
under 26 minutes there.”

The top women, like the men, have
improved since last year.

“Our top four women are stronger
than last year, and there are two freshmen
that can potentially be faster than our ﬁfth
runner from last year,” Sobal said.

Pitt’s top women were the same as
last year. Stacey Anderson ﬁnished sixth
overall in 20:18.1.-~ Stephanie Ellsworth
was just behind her in eighth place with

Another up

and down

weekend in volleyball

   

A1’:-i

A struggling start and an explosive
ﬁnish highlighted a weekend of roller
coaster volleyball as the Lady Panthers
served their way to a 1-2 record at the
Rocky Mountain Classic in Fort Collins,
Colo.

Pitt (5-6) fell to 22nd—ranked
Pepperdine and 24th-ranked Colorado
State before rallying to defeat a pesky
Idaho State squad in ﬁve games.

“This [weekend] was another process
of learning how to adjust as a team,” said
Head Coach Cindy Alvear of the Big East
team “We’re making lineup adjustments
and learning what’s working for us.”

The 22nd-ranked Waves (5-2) took

out the Panthers in three straight games
(16-14, 15-11, 15-12), but freshman Paula
Zernrowski and company did not go
down easily.

“Pepperdine, a very talented team,
had beaten two top-25 teams last week,”
said Alvear. “We played competitively 
and were so close to getting over the
hump in every game.”

The host Rams of Colorado State
made quick work of the Lady Panthers (7-

15, 5-15, 9-15). Three Rams ﬁnished the I

match with at least 11 digs. Colorado
State hitter Rainey Rogers led the attack
with 17 kills and six digs.

Pitt trailed two sets to one in their
ﬁnal match against Idaho State before ral-
lying for the victory, 11-15, 15-12, 14-16,
15-8, 15-9, in what was clearly the best
match of the tournament.

The Bengals had pulled off a major
upset earlier in the day, upending top-
ranked Pepperdine in four games, con-
vincing the Lady Panthers that Idaho
State’s .500 record may have been a bit
misleading.

The Bengals raced out to a 14-2 lead
in the ﬁrst game, prompting Alvear to
make some adjustments during the start of
the match.

“We fared better in the second
[game],” said Alvear. Pitt and Idaho State
went back and forth, with the Lady
Panthers emerging victorious, 15-12, in
the battle. The game two win was Pitt’s
ﬁrst in nine tries and second in its last 18,
dating back to last weekend’s invitational
at Santa Barbara

Pitt’s frustrations escalated when
Idaho State sneaked out of game three
with a 16-14 win. Alvear received a yel-
low card from referee Gary Houghton in

Pittsburgh can be either heaven or hell to the in-
line skater, depending on who he is. For the
advanced skater, Pittsburgh’s many hills and archi-
tecture make it a challenge for both speed and street
skaters alike, while the beginner prob-
ably has enough to worry about ﬂying
down Bigelow at 40 mph without
watching for that oncoming PAT bus.

Yet, in—line skating (or the more
commercially-known “Rollerblading”)
has managed to catch on in Pittsburgh,
and even more so in the Oakland area. The question
is, though, just where can you go to get your blad-
ing rush?

For beginners, I’d like to recommend a nice
smooth, ﬂat surface. You’ll have enough to worry
about just keeping upright without learning how to
brake before some Oakland village idiot decides to
walk in front of you.

Next, it would probably benefit you to stay off
the street. Remember, people in cars don’t like to
stop unless they absolutely have to (Rollerbladers
rank just above squirrels in that regard).

So where is this wonderful Mecca of ﬂatness,
you ask? Well, look no further that your very own
Pitt campus. Several spots come to mind. Try many
of the parking lots, for instance. I
hear the OC lot up by Trees is pretty
deserted at night. Same with the pay

if the police stop by and arrest you
for trespassing, you didn’t hear it
from me.

If you don’t like to mix it up with the law, try
the back streets of Shadyside. While the main
streets like Aiken‘ and Walnut are pretty busy, many
of the smaller streets in the residential area stay
fairly deserted. ‘Then again, you have to watch out
for all those branches and stones, since the street
sweepers like to keep the streets deserted as well.

Okay, before you think you’re just screwed if

Every,Wednesday night at 6:30 p.m.,
the TRIC meets at Liberty School in
Shadyside for a free “start and stop”
clinic.

Learn how to get rolling and,
more importantly, brake. Then you
can follow it up with a nice gentle roll
around the neighborhood. Don’t
worry, there will be a pack of you
should some kids decide they want to
drive their police-officer-dragging
car into you. Stay in the middle — a
couple of the other people should
take the brunt of the force. _

Seriously, though, the TRICs
Beginner’s Skate is a great, safe way
to get started without having to shell
out your hard-earned money.

So, what about those that already
know how to avoid the pot holes,
curbs and poorly-parked cars in
Oakland? Meeting on Tuesday night,
the TRIC has two different skates to
choose from. If you are past the
beginner’s stage, but not yet ready for
the trip down Mt. Washington, try the
Intermediate Skate. ‘

It meets at 7:30 p.m. at the
Outdoor Experience on Walnut St.
and skates for four to eight miles
around the Shadyside locale. It is a
good way to practice up on your
skills and not be totally embarrassed
at doing it alone.

The other skate is the Southside
Bar Roll. It is a 15- to 20—mile tour of
the city in all its wondrous glory.
Skaters fight through bridges, tun-

nels, mountains, and traffic of down- ‘

town. Fortunately, they only drink
Slurpees on the Bar Roll anymore.
Remember, never drink and blade.

If you wish to risk your life on the
Bar Roll outing, meet at 7:30 p.m. at
the Southside Giant Eagle parking
lot.

The TRIC sponsors many other

skates, including a street skate for '

you jumpers and grinders out there.
For more information on the_ Three
Rivers In-Line Club, write to PO Box
86111, Pittsburgh, PA 15221 or call

' 881-7510 (Beginner’s Skate), 834-

6927 (Intermediate Skate), or 371-

ship fee of $10, but the Beginner’s
Skate is free. ’

less Eastern Michigan. The post-game
press conference came complete with
bowl-talk bravado by guys like Sadiq
Durham and John Ryan. Pitt lost the
remainder of its games. .

Sucker.

Fast forward to this season. During
fall camp, most of the talk was about the
depth on offense and the dedication of
the players. The team did set tons of off-
season records, but what good is that on
the ﬁeld?

So far, none. The team embarrassed
everybody affiliated with the University
after the 34-0 season—opening loss to
arch-rival West Virginia. Pitt had the
home crowd, a sold-out stadium and all
those off-season records. West Virginia
had better players. It’s that simple.

The Kent game merely secured a 1-
10 season.

And the song remains the same...

With Pitt in command 21-7 in the
second quarter last Saturday against
Houston, a team that lost 12 straight
non-conference road games, running
back Dwayne Schulters pinned the
Cougars at their own two-yard line fol-
lowing superb kickoff coverage.

After a two-yard run, the Cougars
faced a second—and-eight at the four.
Antowain Smith took a Chuck Clements
handoff and outran the entire Pitt
defense, scorching the left side for a 96-
yard score.

Oh no, I’m having delusions, delu-
sions about last year. But the problem is
these aren’t delusions. This is why the
song remains the same, no matter what
players are involved, what year it is and
who’s coaching.

The opponent was Virginia Tech.

‘J -; L.  ‘ ex:

  

Pitt controlled the first half. Pitt was 2-2
and Virginia Tech, at the time, did not
look like a team about to crush Texas in
the Sugar Bowl.

Tech was pinned on the one—inch
line, Pitt led the game. Hokie quarter-
back Jim Druckemniller launched a pass
to receiver Bryan Still. The play cheesed
Anthony Dorsett, Jr., whose NFL career
is bafﬂing me, for 80 yards. The game
was over. Pitt stunk up the rest of the
season.

As Smith cut Pitt’s defense on
Saturday, fans saw the same things hap-
pening. It’s pretty obvious Pitt won’t
win a road game this season. It’s also
pretty obvious this is another painful
season.

Pitt News.

The Lady Panthers took the
fourth and ﬁfth games in con-
vincing fashion, thanks to the
help of sophomore hitter
Annemarie Tarara. Tarara and
two others registered over 15 kills
in the victory over the Bengals.
The Naperville, Ill. native added
31 digs in ﬁve games in addition
to a .351 kill percentage.

“She’s a young player,” said
Alvear of Tarara “The greatest
players in the world play solid
every day, and Annemarie is ﬁg-
uring how to attain that level of
play. The other girls wanted her

 

in there [for the win]  When
your peers appreciate you more,
it really helps your conﬁdence.”

“I was out of sync [to start]
the toumament,” said Tarara.
“We just picked up our passing
and serving a little bit. Everything
just clicked into place.”

Jennie Diiscoll led the Lady
Panthers over the Bengals with
20 kills, 12 digs, two blocks, and
four block assists despite being
keyed upon most of the weekend.
Diiscoll, who had a team-high 37
kills during the Rocky Mountain
Classic, was also named to the

20:27.7. The winner of the
women’s race was West
Virginia’s Charity Wachera in
18:57.2.

“Pretty much everyone was
a little bit tentative in this race.
At this point in the season, that’s
to be expected,” Sobal said.

Lynda Andros was one
exception to that rule. She was
21st overall in 21:23.0, her best
5000 meter time ever.

“To set a PR in the first race
of the year, on that course,
shows how much better she’ll
be this year,” Sobal said. ‘‘You’ll
see a new and improved model

West Virginia, ranked 26th
in the country this preseason,
won the meet with 29 points.
Pitt ﬁnished well back with 63,
but Sobal wasn’t discouraged.

“We had three in front of
their ﬁfth runner, so we really
didn’t fare too badly against
them,” Sobal said.

Virginia Tech also ﬁnished
ahead of Pitt with 37 points. The
Duquesne women’s team did
not participate in the meet.

Next weekend, the teams
travel to State College for a meet
at Penn State University.
