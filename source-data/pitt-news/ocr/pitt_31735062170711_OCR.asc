Some 30 University faculty
members attended a panel discus-'
sion on "Excellence in a Demo-
cratic University” sponsored by
the Xi Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa
on Thursday, Feb. 1, at 12 noon in
the Faculty Dining Room on the
17th floor of the Cathedral of
Learning.’ A

The panelists included Jonathan

,x-Harris of the Political Science De-

«—~..

" partment; Donald Henderson, As-

sociate Provost; Marcia Landy.

‘president of the Faculty Senate

‘ from the English Department; Edi-

son Montgomery, Associate Vice-
Chancellor of the Health Profes-
sions; and Jerome Schneewind.
Dean of the College of Arts and Sci-
ences. Michael Flack of GSPIA
chaired the session. Each panelist
was limited to a five-minute pre-
sentation.

' Flack opened the discussion by
defining the topic as a perennial
question. He asked if excellence‘
was contradictory to equality in a
democratic society, and if
achievement

,.gv,orthiness in our society. '

Harris said that the College of
Arts and Sciences cannot be a tra-
ditional, elite liberal arts school
like Cornell because "we are op-
erating with an open enrollment."

He reported. thatthere are two
groups of students in the College:
one-third have the traditional
skills needed for a liberal arts ed-

ucation such as vocabulary and

mathematics efficiency, while
the other two-thirds_lack these

is confused with V

skills. Harris cautioned that those
in the deficiency group do not ne-
cessarily lack talent, but rather
lack development because. of fam-
ily background and lack of ex-
perience and confidence.

' According to Harris, neither the
top one-third or the bottom two-
thirds is being self-served by the
present system in the College be-
cause of such factors as.over-
crowded classes and lack of in-
dividual attention.

. "The way we are educating ‘to-
day destroys our sense of self."
he said. ‘ A
Harris_ said the solution to the
problem is to provide a remedial
program to bring the deficient
students up to the high level of_-

competence required by a tradi- ,

tional liberal arts school.

Montgomery pointed out that
Pitt is supported by public funds
and therefore is obliged to accept
“the masses.’_’ Therefore, he said,
the Cornell model of a liberal arts
college must be rejected.

Excellence isequally a result of
the students’ ability as well as the
institutions facilities and many
students quite honestly do not
have the ability. he said. Mont-
gomery defined excellence as
scholarship and rigor. and said
that these remain worthwhile,
values. ‘ ’

Presently, he said. many stu-
dents who come to Pitt are not
bright enough to meet high-stan-
dards, and consequently the stan-
dards are lowered while no effort
is being made to increase excel-.,

Posvar Addresses New Leaders

lence.

Montgomery gave a twofold so-
lution to the problem. First, he
said that the level of competence
for admission into ' the College
should be_gradually raised over a
period of several years, reducing
the enrollment to one-half of what
it is presently. Then, at the same
time, he said, undergraduate pro-
fessional schools should be open-
ed that have lower admission
standards than the College‘. These
programsqshould be flexible and
able to change- with trends and
could include such fields as
health, entertainment, and jour-
nalism. ’

“Students really want these pro-
fessional programs,“ remarked
Montgomery. _

With this system, he said. Pitt
could. maintain a high level of aca-
demic excellence and still meet
its obligation to the state to edu-
cate the masses. P‘

Schneewind defined excellence
as effecting ‘major changes on all
levels through dedicated teaching
on the part of the faculty. But, he
said, this was difficult to achieve
because most faculty members
have greater loyalty to their pro-
fessional commitments than.to
the task of teaching.

"I think that if we (the faculty)
spent as much time and effort
teaching the bottom two-thirds as
we do with our professional obli-

‘_ gations, we could raise them lip
' to a high level of excellence." he

said.
Landy cautioned the panelists

Inauguration Held for SC. Board

by KAREN BURGIO
The inauguration of new Student

Government Board members was )

held Thursday night at 6 p.m. in
the Student Union Ballroom with
an unexpected visit from Chancel-
lor-Posvar.

"This past year, we have'been
building student participation, and
Student Government is an impor-
tant keystone in this endeavor,“
Posvar said. - K

Other University dignitaries,
among them William Rea", chair-
man of the Board of Trustees; Dr.

     

Raymond Coble, executive assis-
tant to the Chancellor, and Dr. Al-
fred Moye, Dean of Student 'Af-
fairs, offered their congratula-
tions to the outgoing board and
expressed hope that the new board
would be as successful in running
Student Government. g -

Rea spoke of the ‘great momen-
tum the old board worked with
and said that he considered the
referendum on the student activ-
ities fee a high spot of the year.

Moye added, “I challenge these
new leaders to advance Student

Government further, for the good

of the University."

Outgoing President Tom Bailey
made light remarks on the occa-

sion. To the board, he said, “You

did one hell of a job to restore my
ego, but you failed.”

He added that the highlight of
this year with Student Govern-
ment was a trip with the adminis-
tration to the Titusville campus.
which included an open bar on the
bus returning home.

He ended his comments with a
final word to the board—“So as
you came. now shallyou go. Ala-
kazam. zap. you are no more.“

Regis Kaufman spoke on a more
serious note when he stated what
he hopes he and the new board will
accomplish. ’

“I want to see greater cohesion
on the SG Board itself. I want to
‘work for greater security protec-
tion on campus, better course se-
lection, expanded student activ-
ities, a Student Government Con-
stitution revision, the problems of
the Hill Side dorms, commuters, a
better Student Union, and _off cam-

_ pus-'housing.”_ ' t. - ,

The ceremony was followed by
dinner in the Kurtzrnan Room and

against "using the language of
commercialism" by speaking of
students as products and educa-
tion as a “tangile commodity.“

She reminded them that students‘

were persons and therefore the
approach to the problem should be
more humanistic than business-
like.

Henderson remarked that the

idea of a traditional liberal arts ‘

school originated with rich peo-
ple sending their sons to school to
learn _how to interact with the
queen's court, and added that this
goal is not relevant to modern
education.

Since. Pitt has become state-re—
lated. he said, it is obliged to ac-
cept students with College Board
scores below the traditional cut
off score of 1200. Therefore, he

a research center, UCUR also
provides external services in con-

Henderson said that in ‘a market ,  .

situation a raw material is put

to get a finished production. He
said the problem at Pitt is that the

changed, but the transformation;

Board Begins Business

by KAREN BRUGIO

Although there wasn't much ac-
tual business to cover in the agen-
da of Thursday's night Student

first meeting of the new board did
exemplify a willingness to get
something accomplished. . 7

According to President Regis

. Kaufman. there will be one-board

member in the SG office at nearly
all times during the day. He also
requested a Constitution Review
Committee to make the SG consti-
tution more det'iriite.

Board member Tom Bailey said
that the new Centrex telephone
system, which is currently being
installed and will begin operation
in the fall, will cost organizations
$7 per month/per telephone num-

ber. Since student organization's ‘

budgets are allocated through SG
by the activities fee, this would
mean that SG would have to cover
a approximate $1,500 phone bill,
“subsidizing God knows who’s
office in the Cathedral,” added
board member Susan Ruffner.

"I can’t see putting another
nickel into this (the Centrex'sys—
temi." said_Kaufman. who prom-
ised to talk to Vice-Chancellor in
Charge of Operations Dutton.

Bailey reported that a movie
made on Pitt’s off-campus hous-

nity Council-Panhellenic Leader-
ship Conference came into ques-
tion. when both groups requested
emergency funding for the pro-

' gram, to be held this weekend at

the Holiday Inn, Greentree. Board
members objected to the lack of
phblicity on the program. for the
leadership conference is open to
all student leaders, 33 per cent of
whom may be non-Greek. The
budget was passed when it was
stressed that a massive publicity
campaign would attempt attract
the non-Greeks, who must have
an application into the SG office
by Wednesday noon. If these
spaces are not filled by non-
Greeks, any sorority or fraterni-
ty member may attend.

Michael Hoyt, country officer
representative to Rhodesia through
the United Nations, spoke to a

group of students in the Faculty ——

Lounge of the Duquesne Student
Union on Friday, February 2.
Hoyt‘s talk was basically of an
informative nature; He related the
events of his experience on being
taken prisoner during the civil
struggle in the southern portion
of the Congo in 1963, and explain-
ed the complex factors that have
created civil conflict in Southern

Rhodesia, which has recently
been brought to the attention of
the United Nations.

In 1965 the non-representative
white government of Rhodesia,
lead by Prime Minister Ian Smith,
requested independence
Great Britain, Hoyt explained
Great Britain, he said, acting with
the advice of the United Nations,
flatly refused_to comply with this
request because it felt that a gov-
ernment of such design could not
represent the best interests of
black Africans. With this, the
white minority of 200.000 began
to take action by the use of force.
Consequently, the United Nations
sent troops there to balance the
situation.

In 1968 the United Nations re-
acted with stronger retaliation,
Hoyt_ said. For the first time in
its history, it ordered overall eco-
nomic and trade sanctions to be
applied to Rhodesia. However,
the sanctions have been deliber-

ately broken by twenty countries, .

including Japan, West Germany,
and the United States.

Since then, according to Hoyt,
Great Britain has made concerted
efforts to bring Rhodesia back in-
to subordination through both‘ eco- ~-
nomjc pressure and diplomacy.

You

eye

from‘

However, Ian Smith’s govern-
ment, stimulated by its ability to
withstand economic sanctions, re-
fused to enter into compromise.

Early in 1973, this same white
minority reacted with its strongest
show of forcd to date, said Hoyt.
It has closed the border between
Rhodesia and Zambia. This spark-
ed a crisis situation, because the
Zambesi River, which forms this
border, is Zambia’s main export
lifeline. Zambian economy is
95 percent dependent on copper.
It needs the Zambesi River if it
is to survive, since 50 percent of
the copper exported leaves the coun-
try through this route.

The U. N. has commended the
Zambian people for their use of
peaceful efforts to correct the situ-
ation. However, Hoyt maintains,
that the country can not resist or
hold out for long, since there is a
risk of permanent damage or total
collapse in store for their economy.
Because of the situation, the U.N.
is considering mounting an air-
lift ‘to relieve the austere condi-

 Hoyf Explains Rodesian Conflict

tions. At present, Hoyt said, a
resolution has been put on the UN
agenda which moves that Great
Britain should come to a defin-
ite and specific conclusion in its
colonial approach to Rhodesia.

When asked what the United
States’ view of the problem is,
Hoyt pointed to three things. He
said that the US still officially
recognizes Rhodesia to be a col-
ony of Great Britain. Secondly,
the US wants to see a peaceful
solution to the problem. And
thirdly, he said, this solution
must include majority rule by
the people of Rhodesia.

Overall, Hoyt, a graduate of
Chicago University and) North-

-western University, said that the

U.S. approach to world politics
can no longer be embodied in
the “Big Brother” act. Rather
the country must find a new

to discuss their personal back-

grounds, orally and_ in written
form. and then to deal later with
"outside analytical materials."

Montgomery reminded the par-
ticipants that Pitt is part of Com-
monwealth system of education,
and therefore does not have to
provide educational services that
another school in the system is
already providing.

Henderson said that the stu-
dents with low College Board

scores can benefit most from the
superior facilities of a university
like Pitt. The intelligent students",
he said, really do not need faculty
except for occasional guidance.
They (intelligent students) could3
be set free in ailibrary and get
along just as well, he said.

“Perhaps,” said Henderson,
“we"“should send the smart kids
to the community colleges and
make the superior pedagogical fa-
cilities of the University available
to the ‘slower’ students who real-
ly need them.” ’

 Half-Way Measure

 The director of University Housing issued a statement to
;5._all resident students on Jan. 29, informing them of a new volun-
iztjary board plan. '

- According to the document. “While freshmen and some.

L"-:9..._‘aid’—» students will be required to purchase a meal ticket. most
 I returning upperclassmen will have the option to decide whether
 _’or not they wish to purchase a meal ticket.“

if H This policy obviously discriminates against freshmen and
__ “aid” students.

 

The new policy also results in an adjustment in room rates .

 to cover the housing expenses previously generated by a sur-
{gcharge applied to the food charge. and to cover the cost of in-
‘fstalling the Centrex telephone system. ' l

 -According to this policy. aid students and freshmen will
b‘e,p,aying a higher room ra-te in addition to the mandatory meal
ticket. ' ‘V '

 ’ The plan also forces students who wish to use the cafeteria
 ,;to pay for those who do not. ‘ ’ A

  . These room rate adjustments and the mandatory meal plan
 for freshmen and aid students results in discrimination against
a. large number of dormitory students.

The plan should be made more equitable for all concerned.

Letters to the Editor

Bum Rap

To The Pitt News:

Last fall the three members
of SDS who were indicted by
the Grand Jury of the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania for put-
ting up posters at Pitt wrote a
letter to the Pitt News explain-
ing why we thought our arrests
were discriminatory. Our argu-
ments in that letter‘ were brief-
ly: _ I

1) All kinds of groups put up
posters. mark up the walls of
their S.U. offices etc.. and nev-
er have we heard of arrests or
even University discipline for
such practices.

2) Even students arrested for
felonies are almost always
brought back for University dis-
ciplinary action rather than be-
ing taken through civil proceed-

3) We had been, putting up
posters for a year and had never

. been asked not to although the

University knew "how to reach
SDS. Our posters were remov-
able with hot soapy water.

4) The arrestingofficer, Pitt
Policeman Penderghast, seemed
quite taken with the fact that
the posters were SDS posters.
Many posters were taken down
by Campus Security before morn-
ing which seems to indicate that
the University did not want
students to read what the posters
had to say about ending univer-
sity war complicity.

Before this letter appeared in
the Pitt News, Joseph Gill. sup-
erintendent of campus police. had
agreed to. Nul’ Proc the case.
which means dropping the char-
ges with the defendants paying
the legal expenses. Our letter

protested this expense and ask-

ed Gil to respond ‘publicly to our
charges and requests. Not only
did ‘Gil refuse to answer the
charges (maybe he couldn’t!)
but he informed our" lawyer
that because he found the let-
ter -demeaning to the Campus
Security. he would now prose-
cute the case all the way. So
now it looks like we are being
tried for writing a letter. The
whole thing will end up costing
us hundreds of dollars.

Therefore we call upon Gil
(once more) to answer the charg-
es if he can. and to drop the
chargesll

The Three’ Defendants

Sexist Contest

To the Editor:
The Undergraduate Women‘s
Union has taken notion of the

' of women.

numerous signs advertising a t-
shirt contest for women. We
feel that these signs are indica-
tive of an attitude of sexism
which can be found in our cam-
pus. our city. our state. and our
country. and we object to it.

The sign tells "girls" that "If
you think you would look good
in a t-shirt . .  you should enter
the contest and be a possible
winner of $100. The contest will
be “fbllowed by a beer blast‘?
during which the lucky winner
might well expect to have num-
erous other honors. bestowed
upon her.

While we feel that the spon-
sors of this contest have the
right to advertise their chauvin-
ist attitudes, we wish to point
out to the compus community
the sexist ideas which underlie
the contest. This contest is an-
other example of the belief that
a woman’s most valuable asset
is her body. Every woman should
be proud of her body, as should
every man. But this does not
mean that women have some need
to display their bodies as if they
were cattle. Any woman who was
truly proud of her body and her-
self would never resort to such
practices.

The discussion of these signs
brought to our minds the adver-
tisements for _fraternity parties
which are seen on campus. Such
slogans as "Get your rocks off—
Beer and Babes“ are in bad taste.
and contribute to a sexist image
Why can't fraterni-
ties simply announce the time
and place of their parties? is
there some contest to see which
fraternity can be the most crude?

Women are tired of being ex-

ploited and of being the brunt,

of jokes. We want to be valued
for ourselves. We don't'want $100
for wow well our breasts show
up in a t-shirt contest. The UWU

objects to practices such as this

which makewomen nothing more
than sexual objects for men's en-

joyment. , I

Gyrn Racket
Pitt News: I

On Sunday January 21.‘ a
friend and I walked up to Trees
Hall to use the gymnasium faci-
lities. We wished to borrow two
paddle ball rackets and a ball.
To our dismay the equipment
room was closed. We went to the
guard at the main door and ask-

‘~ ed if. he knew of a place we

could obtain the equipment. He
directed us\ to the intramural

‘ abroad. The

office. The person in the intra-
mural office was only authoriz-
ed to lend basketballs. He sent
us round about to see other peo-
ple who know nothing.

We knew at this time the gym
floors were taken over by, intra-
mural fraternity
games and woman's gym was be-
fng used for other fames. We
stumbled upon four. teenagers
who do not even attend the uni-

I versity. but had somehow man-

aged to borrow four paddle ball
rackets from the equipment room.
They returned these to the guard
at the door, who would not lend
them to us. The whole situation

imadevus leave with a bad taste

in our months. For a gymnasium
that is supposedly open to uni-
versity students it seemed rather
exclusive.

For a facility that receives
peak ouse on weekends there sure
is not much to do. Those who can-
not get to the gym on weeks days
run into tough luck on weekends.

The decision has been made and published for
some time now — the Supreme Court has determin-,
ed that no state is permitted to legislate the hand-
ling of abortions during the first six months of
pregnancy. Reaction to the decision seems not to’
have peaked yet. but still to be growing.

Typically. there is a rush of reaction to any
Supreme Court decision of sweeping application.
Those whose views were
supported by the Court generallyapplaud the
wisdom of the decision, admire themselves for
having been right all along. and settle down to a
world where their beliefs have become a part of

which then dwindles.

the laws and customs of the land.

The opposition expresses shock, regrets that
the Court saw fit to decide’ as it did, sometimes
mentions that this is yet another evidence of the
decay of all that is best in life, and settles down
to life in a world where an opinion opposed to

theirs is law.

The opposition to the current decision seems
still _to be gathering force. Drastic reactions are
proposed. without much thought to the likeli-

hood of their success.

last three months, the state may

said. the state is now out of the
area of birth control and it is now
in the hands of the medical,pro-
fessions.

Rabbi Phillip Sigal of the Jew-
ish University Center noted that
the moral view of Judaism about
abortion is not specifically stated.
He said that the Talmud permitted
sterilization of a‘ woman to es-

I cape the pain of childbirth and

then avoid‘ the birth of corrupt

- offspring. The Talmud also states

that a child is not a living person
until it emerges into the atmos-
phere and lives on its own res-

busing remain legal.

Amazing.
On to School Prayer. Here. oddly enough.
another group of knotheads (orperhaps some of

the same ones.) is trying to burden the constitu-
tion with yet another amendment stating prayers

, in public schools have nothing to do with either

Church or State. Presumably they do not permit
their children to pray at home or to attend church;
school is the only chance for salvation.

All of this serves to make the future at least
marginally predictable. Somewhere in the land,
perhaps in several places, amendments are. being
drafted. We may not see them for a while, but

' .I guarantee their eventual appearance.

State laws have no doubt already been draft-
ed, designed as carefully as possible to sidestep
the particulars of the decision, but so far the re-
«action is expressed more in statements than in
legislation.

We are told that we are murderers. We are told
that we will vanish for lack of children. We are
told that the Court and its Justices, individually,

and as an institution, can be nothing but the in-I

strument of our destruction. Welare told that mor-
ality, already scarce, will vanish entirely.

Despite problems with equip-
ment failures, late planes and
various and sundry other hassles.
Traffic, Free and John Martyn
put on a great show last Thursday
night at the Arena.

The show was scheduled to
start at 7 o'clock. but nothing
happened until John Martyn came
loping out a little after eight. The
Scottish singer-songwriter is
fairly unknown in this country.
but should catch on soon.

His music is a. curious combin-
ation of folk, blues and jazz. Mar-
tyn ‘has wired up an acoustic
guitar for electric, and creates
some remarkable effects in sound.
He told me the idea behind his
music is “to get the tingle in the
people’s spines.” Lyrics aren’t

-,that important to him; the sound

IS.
“You're too easily misunder-

- stood when you write lyrics that

may be obscure to somebody,"

7 he says. “So it's better to let the
. music tell the story."

And it does. His music features

‘a sound comparable toseveral

waterfalls. tumbling over one an-
other. Heuses no backup musi-

' cians—just Martyn and , his
‘Martin. And it was beautiful to
‘hear. ' ' '

"He was delightful to talk to

but doesn't want to become a
"money—grubbing capitalist."

All I want is juice on the table
and clothes on the baby's back.
I do sell myself and my music.
but only because I have to." ~

Free arrived quite late (planes
were delayed) and went on stage
immediately upon their arrival,
not even taking time to change.
The crowd had been waiting for
over forty-five minutes, and Free
were willing to gratify their need
for music.

They.put on one great set. too.
for no rehearsal and no sound
check. . . They just got up there
and rocked. I was quite sur-
prised; my only previous expos-
ure to their music had been their
single, “All Right Now.” The mu-
sic gets into your bones and makes
you want to rock—they closed their
set with about ten minutes of "All
Right Now," and ‘made it into
much more than a top-40-type
single. . .

About midway through Free's
set, Traffic arrived. The rest of
the grou went toget changed.

-4 but Jim gapaldi, their lead vocal-
ist. hung around the stage, keep-
ing time with Free?-s drummer by

banging his walking stick on the
steps behind the stage.

It‘s a shame he switches from
drums to tambourine. Roger Haw-
kins. their new drummer. al-
though competent, does not have
Capaldi‘s flair.-

The rest of the group is pretty
much the same as it was on their
last outing—Winwood on guitar
(it’s almost as big as he is) and
piano, Chris Wood on electric
sax and flute, Rebop on congas,
Dave Hood on bass and Capaldi
doing vocals and tambourine.

They did several songs off their
new album Shootout at the Fan-

tasy Factory, as well as some
oldies, most notably “Rock and
Roll Stew," which they stretched
into 10 minutes of beautiful. high-
ly-stylized, jazz-tingled rock.

However, I was just a bit bored;
somehow, they don't have the
guts that Free does. Traffic is
technically perfect, and they put
a lot into their music, but it didn‘t
hit me right. A great show, though.
and one which pleased the sell—out

_ crowd at the Arena,,despite the

technical problems.

Coming next is America, at the

Mosque ‘*-on Feb. 21, and George.

the long run, if you‘re young.
Parisien. educated. and on the way
up.,then you will perforce remain
faithful both to your wife and to
the professed, though perhaps never
practiced. ethics of your elders.

Rohmer's new movie, however.
not only deals with the inevitabil-

.ity of retaining the middle—class

ethic. but also with the all-
enation. frustration, and self-right-
eous self-pity inherent in doing
so.

The protaganist. almost in the
tradition of the bourgeois French-
anti—hero, who eloquently bemoans
his incapacity to communicate.
finds his life as a corporate law-
yer not-quite satisfying, and his
lovely suburban apartment “com-
plete with a wonderful wife. child
and another child on the way”
incomplete.

And yet, as we learn, he is not
unhappy because his life has the
sterility desired in- the bourgeoisie;
nor is he unhappy because he is
a- sexist pig. who thinks of all-

. ;'.women, including his wife as at-
A‘ tainable objects. Rather, Bernard

Verley, ‘as the corporarte hero.

i‘ feels sorry forhimself because he

can't really be more sure that he
is missing somethingbecause, h
can’-t communicate. - -

Rohmer after presenting this
slice of a man’s life could have
done many things,he might even
have developed a plot. Unfortu-
nately, he doesn‘t. Rather we see
the arrival of a woman from the
past. Chloe, who decides to seduce
our protagonist. She is unsuccess-
ful. and the hero runs home to
his wife and decides that he will
start communicating with her.
Bourgeois morality always wins.
Even the most alienated of men can
talk to their possessions and re-
alize that they are their wives.

S0 Chloe in the Afternoon be-
comes much more and much less
than a technically perfect, poig-
nant love-story like Jean Renoir’s
Jules et Jim, it becomes a signi-
ficant statement about the seduc-
tive elements of great urban cen-
ters; the simple—minded pleasure
in coming into a modern. well-
decorated office that has been
cleaned for the purpose of
satsifying the occupant, the glee
in strolling from one chique
store to another with a good bal-

ance in the bank and time to waste‘?
' 4.‘

before returning to a pool of sec-
retaries.-at one’.s"beck and call.
And at the same time. Rohmer.
perhaps unconsciously. has con-
trasted’ this physical grace and‘
sophistication with the self-pity-
ing, bareness of the intellectual,
emotional«and political life that
is a nec.es'sa,ry result ‘of letting
bourgeois morality triumph.

But there's one catch. You
must buy your Student—Railpass in

They’re not on sale in Europe
because they are meant strictly for

West, Bruce and Laing

Impress with New Album

by SYLVESTER BENDER

Jack Bruce has a thing for super-
groups. First. playing in Cream
with Eric Clapton and now sud-
denly appearing with Leslie West
in West. Bruce. & Laing which. if
you haven't heard. has already
been labeled a supergroup.

Some may consider it a step _

down for Jack after playing with
Mr. Clapton. but believe me it
isn’t—Leslie West is just an over-
weight. over—sized version of
Clapton. .

Then in rounding out the trio.
there‘s this complacent individual.
Corky Laing, who used to keep a
real nice beat going for a group
called Mountain, which Leslie
West just happened to also be a
member of. How coincidental!

I’ll never forget the first time I
saw Mountain. It was at a fiasco
of a rock festival in Cincinnati
and I remember watching this
admiring fan climbing up onto
the. stage only to be kicked back
down by an obese (300 lb.) gui-
tar, player named Leslie West. I
asked some people next to me who
that jerk on stage was (for at the
time I didn’t know east from
West) and one of them replied,
“I don’t know, man, but he sure
can play that axe,” and that was
about it. I

Ever since that time I really
haven‘t had too much admiration
for Leslie West,
overthree years agoand wounds
do heal with time. Lets just
say I‘ve grown to appreciate his
music, OK. ' ' I

the same name. It's a rather"pul—

sating number and‘ that kind of .

lays you out for the rest of the
album—-you don‘t_ havetoo much
of a“ chance. “Lets get crazy! " '

Following is “Out Into" The

Fields.” a relatively. passive cut ~
if there is such. a -thing ‘coming’

from this group and its passivity
is mainly due to mellow vocal work

   
     
       
     
   
       

It is due to an excellent

thanks to Leslie. He really walls
in this round. .
Unfortunately, Jack plays his
harp (or harmonica for those of
you that might be uncultured)
only once on the album and it’s
in the next cut “Turn Me Over,”
which Corky sings. If you want
to hear these three get down,
now I mean really down,,dig the
last cut on the side called “Third
Degree”, a chunky blues tune.
Too bad Jack didn’t throw a harp
solo in though, for that really
would have .made it, but you
can’t always get what you want.

Speaking of Jack, I hope that
Leslie leaves some of the spot-
light for him because he certainly
deserves it. Try listening to one
of his bass runs and counting all
the notes. It’s impossible because
there's too many. I guess it’s kind
of hard to be a bass player be-
hind Clapton and now West

name,»but that’s the way it is. -

The-second side falls short of‘

the first; but only due to the

fact that two of the cast, “Shake‘ ‘

My Thing“ and “Ple_asure..“ are
slanted towards rock n‘ roll as
opposedfto pure unadulterated
rock and that turns me off. Wedg-
ed between those two is "While
You Sleep." a beautiful arrange-
ment with Leslie playing dobro
and violin guitar with Jack on

‘piano this time. *

‘Wa r'— Proves Worthwhi

by WILLIAM M. SMITH

We all know by now that.
"War is not healthy for plants
and other living things.“ but it’s
a proven money—maker and it keeps
the population down. Name the
date and place. War is good any-
time in any town.

Saturday night, War came to
Pittsburgh.

It didn‘t come as a surprise to
anyone. for we'd been expecting
War for about a month and were
ready. I never thought I'd be
caught saying. I think War is
great, but Ido. And so. do ap-
parently. do a lot of other peo-
ple. It was a sell-gout two days
before the concert.

Once past the inevitable. ini-
tial fracas of getting through the
front doors of the Syria Mosque
and inside the auditorium. you
could sense the calm. It‘s a cool
concert crowd that knows how
to wait for a good thing. And they
had to.

A local group supplied some
nice warm up sounds and we then
found out that Tower of Power
had cancelled. Well. that’s sort
of ,a letdown. but we didn‘t re-
ally come to see them anyway.
now did we. ‘ -

So everyone eases back and
waits for that good War thing
to start comin‘
while, you couldn’t ask for better
muzak-Jazz, soft. funky.‘and soul-

ful. Real easy listening. Someone "

sure knows_.how to soothean anx-

ious crowd and make that long ‘'

wait more tolerable.

About an hour later, Mr. Intro-H

rnan strolls on stage to warm the
audience with .a little off-the-'

shoulder rap. Then. out comes A.

War, and it’s, “Hil! Hie! 2 High! !

Monday, February'5, l973—THE PITT NEWS—Page 

In a blue haze. there stands
before me a Gypsy Man. playing
a harmonica in a funky. frenzied
dance around some magical camp-
fire. The jam they then went
into must have lasted at least
twenty minutes. but the effect
was timeless.

Then. here comes the Cisco
Kid. hot on the heels of the
gypsy. "He drinks whisky. Pan-
cho drinks the wine." I noticed
they weren't too proud to down
a little Iron City also.

Son Oh Sun is a rather obscure
cut from one of their earlier al-
bumsrbut it‘s one which most
aptly displays their harmonic
virtuosity and believe me. those
vocals are just as tight live as on
record. And I think Lee Oskar
and Charles Miller have some-
thing going on ‘cause that harp
and horn just work too tight
together.

In their Spill The Wine days-
despite Eric Burdon. I recog-
nized War as a superb back-up
band. so it didn‘t surprise me at

S In Chapel“ Setting

Renaissan

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

Litury has exemplified itself as
one of the most sublime of all art
forms and the recent enactment
of a Renaissance mass in Heinz
Chapel this past Sunday
forced this fact in the minds of
many of us who attended. Spon-
sored by the University Oratory
of the Holy Spirit, the mass was
celebrated by the Most Reverend
John McDowell. Auxiliary Bish-
op of the Catholic Diocese of Pitts-

burg. and by the priests of the Ora- 

tory.
When we speak ‘of the aesthetic
quality of liturgy. three things im-

mediately come to mind: music_.__.

ornaments. and actions. All three
of these essentials were present
in Sunday’s mass, in forms which
have become relatively rare since

the Second Vatican Council. and

it is because of this fact that the
celebration was such an auspi-
cious one. ' ' -

Two musical groups under the
direction of Dr. Don Franklin pro-
vided the musical portions of the
liturgy. The first, the Pittsburgh
Madrigal Singers, provided the or-
dinary of the Mass, John Taver-
ner’s Mass of the Western Wind.

_The second, a schola cantorum of

members of the Heinz Chapel
Concert Choir,_rendered the plain-

Anpabundance of candles, due to
the celebration of the Purification
with its ceremony of the blessing
of candles. was also noticeable.

Dramatically, the actions of the
Mass were manifold. The blessing
of candles and the solemn proces-
sion following found both priests
and people participating in the
ritual together. Incense rose to

,the chape1‘s vaults throughout the ,

liturgy in the evident hope that

the prayers of the mass would

end in much the same manner.

Most of the celebration was in
Latin but the congregation, some-
what timid at first, soon proved
itself to be quite at home. Parti-
cipating in responses throughout,
they were especially eloquent dur-
ing the Lord’s Prayer and "dur-

ing the singing of the final hymn——

Aquinas’ Adoro te devote.

What must especially be re-
membered following the celebra-
tion of an event such asthis is the
fact that those present were wit-

ed like a cement for Western Eur-
opean civilization over a thousand
years of history. The revival of
the form of the old mass mustiat
least impress upon us the cen-
trality of worship in'Western cul-
ture and wecan at least be grate-

ful to those responsible in its re-

vival for showing us that.

"That‘s the first time we've won two games in
a row.“ rejoiced Pitt‘s outstanding junior forward
Mickey Martin after the Panthers victimized the
William and Mary Indians by the score of 83-62.

The Cats will try to make it three in a row when
they host the West Virginia Mountaineers tonight at

‘ 8pm.

This second consecutive win against the Indians
puts the Cats one, step closer as they struggle to

-~ reach the .500 mark—their record stands at 8-10.

Martin, along with teammate Bill Knight, were

key factors in the Panthers shooting assault against ’

thelndians. The two Pitt stars combined to rack up
50 out of the team’s total points—-Knight collecting
26 and Martin hitting for 24.

In the first half alone the two outstanding cag-
ers combined for 30 points which easily outdid the
efforts for the entire William and Mary squad dur-
ing that same period—the Indians were only able to
come up with a meager 23 points before thefend of
the first half. '

William and Mary primarily employed the zone
defense against the Panthers‘ but could not hinder

' the firey guns of the Pitt shooters.

f‘They used a zone against us and we’ve had
some trouble against the zone before,” related
Pitt’s head ‘basketball coach Buzz Ridl. “But today
we had great movement with the ball and our pass-
ingwas very sharp.” . j

The Panthers used a somewhat different ap-
proach against the William and Mary zone than
they had done _in the past. Martin. who usually
roams the outside of the court, was placed inside
while Knight. who subsequently had played the in-
side. was repositioned outside. . ‘

This switch‘ took place primarily to allow,

Knight the opportunity to take more outside’ shots

 

he can work around.”

“I played low. From now, on I’m playing under-
neath against the man to man defenses,” explained
Martin. “The coach wants Mooney outside more so

With the help of Knight and Martin and a team
shooting average of .552 in the first half the Pan-
thers went to their locker room at halftime with a
comfortable 44-23 lead.

The Panthers quickly copped the lead and then
proceeded to run away with it. The most thatlWil-
ham and Mary could do in response to the hot Pan-
thers guns was to come up with a .314 shooting aver-
age in the first half. There were several two-three
minute spurts during this time that the only thing
the Indians could do was watch the Cats score but
coult not do the same themselves.

The attack by the hoopsters continued in the
second half with the Panthers shooting .590 per cent
and at one‘ point (with 8:l1'left in the game) they
overshadowed their opponents with a 25 point lead.

. William and Mary. however. did anything but
give u the second /half rolled around.
The Indians practically doubled their shooting per-
formance. coming back with a .615 shooting per-
centate f'rom the field. They were able to tie the
Panthers in the number of points obtained in the
second half (both teams hit for 39 points a piece 1.

"We had a tendency to take it easy in the sec-

shot better in the second half. We missed a lot of
foul shots that would have given us about 10 points
more.“ '

Despite the problems that the Panthers incur--
red, Ridl was more than pleased with the results of
the game. _ _

“I think we're quicker. we moveed better. and
we moved the ball better.“ he stated.

V The Panthers will be confronting a strong
West Virginia squad tonight at the Field House.

The Mountaineers are 8-5 on the season after

overtime. Another top basketball’-opponent that they
have knocked off is Villanova by the score of 79-73.

It was a day of winning and a day of losing for
Pitt's wrestlers on Saturday as the grapplers pad-
ded. and then had winning-strings snapped at Lan-
caster. Pa.

They trounced Franklin & Marshall. - 38-4. at
noon. and were edged. 21-15. by East Stroudsburg in
the second contest of back-to-back meets.

The Cats” modest two-meet win skein—their
lar ‘this season——was broken by the East

Stroudsburg squad. with the aid of questionable of-“‘

ficiating. Although he didn‘t want to use it as an ali-
bi. Coach Dave Adams deplored the umpiring at
Lancaster.

The refereeing in the second meet was bad,” he

said. “I don’t want to make excuses, but the guys .

just didn’t have the knowledge he needed to be a
ref. Matches involving Minard, Beck, and Buzzato
might have turned outcompletely different if the
guy had known the rules.”_

All three Pitt matmen dropped close decisions.
Buzzato's loss to East Stroudsburgs Paul Lucken-
baugh was the first nine straight winsfor the 150
pound senior from Bridgeville. Pa. Buzzato‘s only
other loss this year came in Pitt’s opening meet at
Michigan. where Big Ten Champ John Hubbard beat
him. 9-1.

The Panthers squad probably wishes they could
have saved‘ some points from the F&M thrashing
to use against Stroudsburg. In the moon contest. the

Cats swept all but one weight class—~freshman Don ,.

Rother lost at 126 pounds.

The meet began with George “Fuddy” Bryant
copping a superior decision, ll-3, over Baxter in the
118 pound category. Bryant, who was one of four
double winners for the Panthers, also registered a
fall, his first of the year, in the second meet agaiost
East Stroudsburg’s Fred Schereck.

After Rother‘s loss to Carothers to knot the
meet at 4-4. the Cats proceeded to sharpen their
claws as Beck. Selfridge. Buzzato. Chatman. Dalla-
tore. Minard. Tritch. and Roba all took their
matches.

Dallatore. at 167. scored_a fall for the ‘Pan-
thers.__who have now chalked up five pins in their
last five matches. Craig Tritch and Buzzy Beck

Jim Howell returned to win the

continued to provide a pleasant
surprise for the Panthers as he
won the 200-yard breaststroke
with All Bischoff coming in sec-
ond. “Martin has become a great
asset to the team in the last few
meets,” according to Bradshaw.

Jack Garrow won the three-me-
ter diving event with Jeff Miller
coming in second. The meet ended
with American winning the 400-
yard freestyle relay.

“The swimmers showed good
potential in the meet,” comment-
ed Bradshaw. “After this predom-
inantly freshman team gets some
more experience, they should be
able to swim on an even basis with
teams like Maryland and Kent
State.”

The tankers then traveled to
Maryland to face the Terrapins on
Saturday afternoon.

here as they had one the night be-

Co-ed Swimmers Burst

Big Bubbles In Trees

Pool Intramural Fun

Special to The Pitt News
Intramural sports went to the water in a co-ed swim meet last
Wednesday night. Straying from the traditional swimming events, un-
derwear, umbrellas, balloons, the inner tubes were worn, carried, and

sat in during the different events.

Tug of war and water basket-
ball were two of the events which
involved more drinking than swim-
ming.

Wearing "long johns” under-
wear. the contestants found it in-
creasingly difficult to swim with
their pants washing off. Roars of
laughter were heard from the
crowd and competitiors as the
getting into and out of the wet un-
derwear proved to be a graceless
chore. In the balloon relay, to fin-
ish the swimmer had to break the
balloons by‘ sitting on it. This re-
quired some skill and daring as
balloons had a_ tendency to slide
out from under the swimmers wet
derriers, sometimes culminating
in big bangs. —

First place winner—PESA, sec-
ond place winner with govern-
ment backing — AFROTC, and
third place winner was Harry’s
team. Fourth place went to the
Commuter Association.

The next co-ed intramural event
is paddleball. Turn your name in
at the Intramural Office, 125

Craig Tritch and Carl Roba
both won convincing decisions at
190 and heavyweight, but it wasn’t
enough to turn the meet around
and the Cats season record fell to
5-6.

Pitt had four double winners in
the 'day’s action: Bryant. Cha't—
man, Roba, and Tritch. -

Coach Adams was especially
pleased with the performances of
Roba. “It’s the best he’s looked all
season,” he said after the grid-
der-turned-grappler scored a 10-3
win over Stroudsburg’s Smanson,'
who had a 9;3 log going into the
match.

Bryant, whom Adams insists is
one of the East’s best, jacked his
personal win streak to four in a
row, and will now be prepping for
a showdown with Tom Teagarden,
Penn ’State’s ace, and Fuddy’s
high school nemisis.

Coach Adams’ squad of Pan-
thers next wrestle at home this

‘Wednesday night at 8 against

Penn State. The Nittany Lions are
currently polled number one in the
East, while the Panthers’ are
rated number nine in the. same

Tracksters Place 3
At Clvcl. Invitational

by LYNN HARRIS

The Pitt track team went to
Cleveland last weekend for the
Cleveland-Invitational came back
with three places.

Rich Jackson competed in the
440. taking second place with a
51.3. Tim Riley took fifth place in
the high jump with a 6.8. and
George Jupin cleared 6.6.

The two-mile relay team cap-
tured second place, an improve-
ment from last year when they
took fourth. Villanova won the
two-mile relay this year. they
came in third last year. Members
of the two-mile relay team are Ken
Silay. Tom Moore, Bob Steele. and
Rich Markley.

Thelmile relayteam took third
place, bettering last year’s mark
of fourth place. Ted Bobby, Rick
Weaver, Chuck Mozingo, and
Rich Jackson make up Pitt’s mile
relay team. -

"The relay teams did very
good.” commented head coach
Jim Banner.

"I was very pleased with all the
athletes," he continued.

Cleveland doesn’t have a very
good track, it has a lot of sharp
turns, therefore, the athletes
were competing for places rather
than times." Top athletes from all
over. the nation competed in this
meet. '

Optimistic about the future of
the Pitt rack team, Banner feels
this is the "best we‘ve looked
since the flu hit us. In another
week we’ll be back where»we
were in the beginning of January.“

  Women Gymnasfs' Win

Saturday. the Pitt women gym-
nasts squeezed past Temple Uni-
versity by the score of 68.40-63.40.
The meet was planned to be a tri-
meet with both Temple and Fran-
lin & Marshall, but at the last min-
ute F&M cancelled out altogether.

The score speaks for itself con-
cerning the even match between
Pitts and Temple’s women gym
teams. However. the difference

lay in the fact that Temple’s
squad is centered around the__ca_p_-_
abilities of two’ of its members,
one of which is Helen Morre. sis-
ter of Joan Moore of Olympic
gymastic fame. On the other hand
the Pink Panthers are more of a
"team" in the sense that all the
girls really work to pull their own
weight in the events.

. Proof of this distinction be-
tween the teams is evidenced by
the fact that all but one of the
places taken by Temple went to
Helen Moore. She placed first in
both vaulting and the uneven par-
allel bars by scores of 7.7 and 7.0.
respectively- Then in balance
beam and floor exercise, Moore
took second place, leaving third
place in the floor exercise to one
of her teammates.

Pitt took both second and third
places in .vaulting with Huldah
Jones scoring 6.93 and Kathy Dry-
nock scoringi 5.80. ‘ ‘

Pitt’s Coach Gail DiCicco com-
mented, "Temple’s girls had fan-
cier vaults of higher caliber than
the ones my girls did. Yet we pull-
ed our vaults off cleanly. Tem-
ples were poorly executed."

In reading the above-given
scores it should be obvious that
they are all relatively low. This
was true throughout the entire
meet on Saturday. DiCicco said,
“The judges were extremely
tough on scoring. But since the
low scoring was used for both
teams, it was not unfair. to either
team.”

At the end of the first event the
overall scores were 18.80 for Pitt
to 18.30 for Temple. Then the-sec-
ond event, the uneven parallel
bars, showed Pitt’s Kathy Kry-
nock with second place scoring
5.56, followed by Ann Krupa of
Pitt with a15;53. This widened the
gap in the overall scores, giving
Pitt a lead of 19.05 to 14.89.

Balance beam was the third
event and Donna DeMarino of Pitt

performed a perfect beam‘ routine
having trouble only withrher dis-
mount. Nevertheless, she man-
aged to capture first place with a
6.90. Moore of Temple came in
second with a 6.0, followed by
Pitt’s Patty Martin scoring 4.63.

The final event, floor exercise,
saw a real battle for first place
as DeMarino of Pitt came out
ahead of Moore by one-tenth of a
point. She scored 7.4 to Moore’s
7.3. Third place in this event also
went to Temple.

DiCicco was pleased with her
squad’s performance. “They all
came through. It was a real team
effort. My girls’ scores were
close and therefore we were able
to pull more places.

The meet with Temple was the
Pink’ Panthers’ third this season.
Their record stands at two wins
and one loss. This Saturday after-

noon they will travel to Indiana.

University in the hope of boosting
their record to 3-1. '
