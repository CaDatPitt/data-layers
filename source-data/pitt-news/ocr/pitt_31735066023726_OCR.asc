Pitt News Staff Writer
HARRISBURG—The possibility
of a winter tuition hike hinges _on

the fate of appropriations bills now «

tied up in the state legislature and
the outcome of the Liquor Control
Board appeal, according to Gov.
Thornburgh’s budget spokesman

. Nick DeBenidictus.

Although today is the deadline
set by Thornburgh for abating ten
percent of the funds earmarked for
state-related universities, necessary
abatements will not take effect until
Oct. _16, and may be less than 10
percent, DeBenedictus said.

“Abatements occur officially as
of Oct. l,” DeBenedictus said.
“But the first payment (from Pitt)
is requested Oct. 16. ' That is when
the cuts will take place.

r Posvar’s Resignation;

Saysllcls Director Search Faulty I

By SETH LUBOVE
Pitt News Staff Writer

©l980, The Pitt News

Despite allegations by a Pitt pro-
fessor that the circumstances sur-
rounding a search for an appointee
to fill a university directorship were
seriously defective, the administra-
tion maintains that the search pro-
cedures were completely legitimate.

In a widely circulated memo to
Pitt’s faculty and board of trustees,
Dr. John Chapman , of Pitt’s
political science department criticiz-
ed the search and appointment pro-
cess of selecting a director of the
University Center for International
Studies (UCIS) as possibly failing‘
“to meet the test of legality.”

But Rhoten Smith, senior vice
chancellor and provost, who had
authority over the search,
countered the . allegations as “a
tempest in a‘teapot,” and referred
to the appointive process as being
“done in a very professional, open

, manner.”
f‘They’re the allegations of one '
« man and I’ve answered them to

him. The fact that he sent copies to
everybody in the world doesn’t
make_.it very news worthy in my opi-
nion,” Smith said.

The LCB then appealed the deci-
sionand is now awaiting outcome
of the appeal. '

“We’l1 have to completely assess
-the s_ituation after the court
battles,” LCB charman Daniel Pen-
nick said in an interview. He‘ added
that the LCB is in good shape finan-
cially right now.

Some funding for non-preferred
schools can still be made available
without the price changes, accor-
ding to DeBenedictus.

“Even without the LCB pricing.
policy, we’ll have money to use, but
we aren’t certain of how much,”

‘DeBenedictus said.

“The LCB is making more
money than was projected in
January,” DeBenedictus added.
“Some of this money will be achiev-

room. They told me to fill out a maintenance slip.”
Mary Hamilton, a 12th floor resident, noticed the

roaches during the first week of school.
“I found three in our room. One on the floor, one in the

closet and one under my roommate’s bed,” she said.
Becky Sload was-taking a shower when she met up with

“We tried to drown it, but it wouldn’t drown.”

And when the roaches started to appear in the trash room
and in the halls in an overabundance, the residents decided
that it was true to do something about it. _

After contacting the Towers’ desk, the residents were
told that the roaches were coming up through the water
_. pipes. The desk told them to fill out a maintenance slip,
Sload said.

After the first maintenance slip was submitted, the
residents started to spray their rooms with a commercial

The new director of UCIS, Dr.
Burkart Holzner, the former chair-
man of Pitt’s sociology department,
was named director of the center ef-
fective Sept. 1, 1980, succeeding
Dr. Carl Beck who died last year. '

Holzner had no comment on the
allegations: “It’s not really my
business. . .because my appoint-.
ment is the outcome of a process
which I-didn’t shape. I really have
nothing to say.”

And in conjunction with these
allegations, Chapman has called for
the resignation of Chancellor
Wesley Posvar as the “only
honorable course. . .for the good of
this university and the academic
profession. "

Chapman’s allegations that the
appointive proceduresof both the
chancellor and the provost were
“seriously defective, possibly even
illegal,” centered on a lack of “pro-
vision for extensive recruitment,
open competition, and selection on
the basis‘ of competitive merit.’-’
These allegations were presented in
an August 22, 1980, memo address-
ed to Posvar and distributed among
the faculty and board of trustees.

Although Posvar has not
responded directly to Chapman, the
Assistant Chancellor Edward Bozik

sion.” ,
DeBenedictus said the LCB re-
tained a surplus from last year’s
earnings. ,
“They (the LCB) have a surplus,
and we can transfer some of this
_surplus to the non-preferreds,
DeBenedictus said. ' ' ‘

the final choice that was made by
the provost and approved by the
chancellor,” Bozik said.

“I have read the memo and I can
say that there are statements in Pro-
fessor Chapman’s memo that are_
blatantly false. For instance, there
was a search conducted in accord

was a full and complete nationwide
search and it was conducted in ac-
cord with general university policies
for searches of this nature. Indeed,

According to Smith, the selection
of a director of the center does not
require any search process for an
administrative position like the
directorship, “but because of the
importance (of the position) I

wanted to bring a number of other

people into it.”

Dear Professor Chapman:

As you know, the position of Director of the University Center for
International Studies is now vacant, although Paul Watson has carried on, and
continues to carry on, very capably since Carl Beck's death. '

At the Chancellor's request, I have formed a small faculty review
committee, comprised of Professors Paul Masoner, as Chair, Daniel Cheever,
Bert Rockman, John Singleton, Vijai Singh, and Buzz Fozouni to assist us in
identifying an outstanding person to fill this most important post.

In order to identify unusually qualified candidates I am soliciting the
advice of a number of people in the faculty and the administration, who I believe
have an ongoing interest in UCIS. I

If you know of any such highly qualified individuals, either inside or
outside the University, whom you would regard as strong potential candidates
for the Director's position, please send the names and a little about your nominee
I should like to have all names by April 18.

position in International Studies which Carl and Paul achieved over the last

Reasons_For New Director

UCIS was established at Pitt in
1968 as an effort to coordinate the
various international studies and
activities of Pitt's professional
schools and academic disciplines.
The center cooperates with in-
dividuals, departments, and schools
throughout the university in sub-
jects involving international con-
cerns. ”

The directorship of UCIS was
vacated last year when ,Carl Beck,
director of the center since its foun-
ding in 1968, died October 24, 1979,

number-of things were done as part
of the search process:

-—the provost met with and cor-
responded‘ with members of the

administrators alike, “getting their

believed would be top-quality peo-
ple who would be well qualified for
the job.”

—members of the review com-
mittee recommended a number of
names and communicated with col-
leagues in the university faculty
concerning possible candidates for
nominations.

—members of the review com-
mittee, the faculty, the provost, and
the chancellor “communicated with
people in the field who were
knowledgeable concerning the kind
of [thing that UCIS~ is all about,”
Masoner said. .

The Blind Advertisement

Although the advertisement was
placed in The Wall Street Journal
on the scheduled day, the ad was
not placed in The New York Times
in either the ,“Careers In
Education” section or the general
want ads according to Chapman.
He claimed to have been unable to

_ locate the ad in the listings for April

29, May 4, 6, or 11.

The Pitt News was provided with
a copy of the ad as it appeared in
The Wall Street Journal. But later,
The Pitt News was informed by the

provost’s office that since the ad as '

it was to appear in The New York
Times was identical to The Wall
Street Journal ad, the ad as it ap-
peared in the Times was not retain-
ed in the provost’s office.

to’: Provost Rhoten A. Smith . ' k_‘
FROM: J. W. Chapman
mg. 15 April 1980
SUBJECT: Appointment 9; Director 9; University Center jg; International Studies

In response to your letter of 10 April, in which you request my advice on candi-
dates for this position, I write to express my concern about the appointive pro-
cedures that you and the Chancellor have established. Your-procedures appear to
be seriously defective.‘

To ensure that this position is filled by that person, among those available, best
qualified to meet its requirements, there must be extensive recruitment. Advice
from selected persons does not constitute extensive recruitment.

The rules and regulations of the Federal government concerning "affirmative ac-
tion” and equal employment opportunity prescribe open competition and selection
on the-basis of competitive merit. Your procedures may very well fail to meet

the test of legality. ' r

(5

Moreover, both academic freedom and fundamental justice dictate application of
the principle of equal opportunity in appointment. No university can be rightly
run other than as an open society. To do so violates both the purpose of the
university and the rights of individuals.

In addition to the failure of your procedures to provide for open competition and
equal opportunity, the procedures would appear to be defective in yet another
respect. In the second paragraph of your letter you refer to a "small faculty
review comittee" that has been formed "to assist us in identifying an outstanding
person to fill this.most important post." You.make no reference to screening,
and evaluation procedures, including external evaluations, that are designed to
ensure that the chosen candidate isgthe best person available. Fair evaluation
of competing candidates requires their rigorous and documented comparison, a pro-
cess in which the use of external assessors is essential and customary. ~

On the basis of these considerations, I recomend that you advertise the position
in the Sunday edition of Egg ﬂgg York Times and in Egg Economist of London. This
is the only way in which you can discharge your responsibility for the integrity
of our appointive processes and for us all to meet our moral and legal obligations.

nothing that he could do because the head of the depart-
ment was on vacation.

Hal Lavin, the supervisor of environmental services,
does not believe that it took that long for the residents to
get action. ‘ ~

“Our contract with the exterminating company says that
they must exterminate every other Thursday. It’s highly
possible that nobody saw the exterminators when they
came.” _ . 0 .

Lain said that the exterminators won the 12th floor dur-

ing the time hewas on vacation, according to their records.
The exterminators, according to Lavin, sprayed the
hallways, the trash room and the bathroom.
' ' Dana Brown does not believe that the exterminators were
there. “I don’t see how they could have exterrninated
because the number of roaches did not decrease by any
significant number.” » '

Pitt’s exterminating is done mostly by Commonwealth
Exterminating. Glenn Reutzel, service supervisor of Com-
monwealth, explainedthe problem of spraying.

“The labels on spraying materials are legal documents.
The label says how much we can apply and in the manner
that it is to be applied.”

The chemical used in spraying the Towers is called
Dursban. It is the same chemical used in spraying food
establishments. It is not harmful to humans but it does kill
roaches. " ‘

“Much of the material is applied in cracks and crevices,”
Reutzel said. ' '

The roaches did not disappear. Instead, they seemed to
have gotten worse after the first spraying allegedly took
place. Not all of the residents reported having roaches in
their rooms. The main problem areas were the trasy room
and the-bathroom. The residents who did have roaches in
their rooms were situated across the hall from the two pro-
blem areas. _ A

One of the residents reportedly was taking a sweater
from her drawer when a roach fell out.

Although Commonwealty is scheduled to come twice a
month, they do make special trips to areas that have pro-
blems. _ »

“All of the rooms are on call, what we call special ser-
vice. If there is a problem, we usually get a man out within
24 hours,” Reutzel said.

When the exterminators did show up last Thursday, it
was their normal scheduled time. The question remains
unanswered: did the exterminators come because they were
scheduled or because of the persistence of the residents?
The answer seems to be in the records of environmental ser-
vices, which at this time are unattainable because the head
of the department is on vacation.

Commonwealth exterminated most of the rooms_ and

. outside of both the trash room and bathroom when they

were on the 12th floor last Thursday. . A few roaches,
however, were still evident this Monday.

“If the roaches were seen in the daytime, they were pro-
bably disoriented from the spray and were on their way to
die,” Lavin said. '

Cockroaches are nocturnal insects and do most of their
crawling at night or in a place where it is dark, such as the
trash rooms. The residents are afraid that the roaches will
return in large numbers in a couple of months. Lavin of-
fe_red ,a solution.

“As long as the students keep food in their rooms, and in
the trash room, it’s very difficult to keep roaches from
coming backgto a certain degree,” Lavin said.

The residents, however, reported finding food crumbs in
their drawers when they first moved in.

ference housing. It’s possiblethat the users were bringing
food in,” said’ J oAnn Woodson of the Office of Residential
Life. “If one floor is doing something bad, the bugs crawl
up through the pipes,” she added.

Although housekeeping does have routine cleaning of the ’
Towers over the summer, Lavin said that it is almost im-
possible to schedule the conferences around the cleaning,

The residents also reported that some of the dirt is not
their fault. .

“Two out of the four showers don’t drain. They are
gray, dark and wet, just the kind of condition roaches"
love,” Hamilton said. . '

They also reported that the showers have only been
cleaned once since the term started, and the trash room has
not been cleaned at all. '

‘‘It would help keep them (the roaches) down if the place
was a little bit cleaner,” the same resident added.

Reutzel commented that the roaches do not appear out
of nowhere. _

“People bring personal effects from home and they may
be bringing the roaches in,” he said. “The students create
a condition conducive for roaches to survive; such things as
spilled pop or food wrappings;"’ he added. ‘

Lavin reported that the problem may also be the garage
under the Towers where there are sewers.

“We don’t have more of a roach problem than anybody
else,” he said. But he added, “Maybe we better look more
closely at the 12th floor.” '

Woodson has her own solution to the problem.

“It’s a two-part thing. If everybody will be trying to
keep everythingconstantly clean, plus the exterminators,
the problem could be solved,-” she said.

Lavin suggested that food that the students bring in
should be kept in containers, not just lying around opened.

“The students are paying money to live here. “There’s
no way they should have to live with roaches,” said Brown.

The head of the environmental services will be returning
today and her records will show whether all the
maintenance slips and complaints were actually filed

According to Smith, the place-

“Sometimes we have open ads,

what effect that has on it at all,”
Smith said. ‘

Result of the Search Process

As a result of the search process,
the review committee had a list of
approximately 80 names, “not just
a random selection of names, but
rather what amounted to a screened
selection of names,” according to
Masoner. Rather than starting with
a very large list of names, ‘many of
whom would have been unqual-

University of Pittsburgh
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

TO: Wesley W. Posvar, Chancellor of the University

FROM: John W. Chapman, Professor of Political -Science

DATE: 22 August 1980

SUBJECT: Directorship 9;" _t_h_e University Center _f_9_r_ Internation_a_l Studies
Dear Mr. Chancellor: \

On 15 April 1980, I sent the Provost a memorandum on the appointment of a Director,
in which I pointed out that your appointive procedures were seriously defective,
possibly even illegal.

‘(ourprocedures made no provision for extensive,recruitment, open compe:ition,___and
selection on the basis or competitive merit. Rather you appeared to rely upon nom-
inations and advice from a small “Review Committee," and from selected members of

the faculty. Hence, as essential to the discharge of your responsibility for the

integrity of our appointive process, I recommended that you advertise the position
in the Sunday edition of The flew York‘ Times and in the London Economist.

I understand that an anonymous, “blind“ advertisement was placed in the Times on
Sunday, 27 April, and for the following day in the western Edition of the wall

Street Journal. I have been unable to locate this advertisement in the "Careers in

 

Education" listing in "The Week in Review" section of the Times for that date. Nor
does it appear in that listing for 29 April, or 4, 6, and 11 May. Given the good
reputation of our Center and its Programs, surely an open advertisement would have
been far more likely to_e1icit appropriate candidates.

I understand further that five candidates, two from within and three from without
the University, were interviewed and evaluated; that the "Review Committee” enthusi-
astically endorsed one of the external candidates, with whom. negotiations were sub-
sequently begun. Apparently he could not consider immediate appointment, that is,
September 1930. whereupon negotiations were broken off and arf internal candidate
appointed to the Directorship.

From this train of events arises naturally the uestion as ‘to whether or not a
_ Q
genuine search was conducted.

Notice the initial reluctance to place the post in open. national competition.
tbreover, failure to put a proper advertisement in the "Careers.in Education” list-
ings suggests less than energetic pursuit of the best available person. And given
the date of advertisement, no genuine search could be made on the presumption of
appointment in September 1980. The academic world does not work according to that
time table. Established people need a year to change positions.

Hr. Chancellor, I regret to say that I find it reasonable to conclude that a genuine
search has not been conducted, whether inadvertently or deliberately, and that you
have failed your responsibility for the integrity of our appointive process. If
you are not prepared to discharge this supreme trust, then I respectfully suggest
that your nnly.honorable course is resignation for the good of this University and
the academic profession. , ' ’

In,any case, I recommend that you remove the incumbent from office, appoint an act-
ing Director, and institute a newand thorough search with a view to appointment of
a Director in September 1981. ’ "

either by University By—Laws or University Senate resolution.
of my own concern and that of many faculty for identifying the best possible candi-
dates for the position, and because of the seminal importance of the Center for the
work ofia great number of our faculty, I did constitute a representative Review Com-
mittee and that Committee carried out their responsibilities fully and with high
professional competence and integrity.

which the Chancellor and I have the highest possible confidence--a confidence which
is shared by a significant number of interested faculty.

with a sh_orter list of 80 “well-
qualified people,” Masoner ex-
plained. ‘

Then the review committee and
the provost’s of fice made a series of
telephone calls to the candidates on
the screened list of 80, “especially
to the people-. . . we regarded as
especially well-qualified and people
whom we would be anxious to con-
sider seriously for the position,”
Masoner explained.

There was a further 'screening
process and the list was narrowed to
five possible candidates, each of
whom was invited to Ihe Pitt cam-
pus to meet with the review commit-
tee, members of the UCIS staff,
faculty, administrators, and “other
key persons.”

“It was a very thorough two day
visit in which they had a chance to
take a very good look at the univer-
sity and we in the university had a
very good chance to take a look at
them,” Masoner said.

The review. committee forwarded

their evaluations, observations, and ‘

recommendations of the candidates
to the provost and the chancellor
where the final decision was made.

“The decision was an ad-
ministrative one that the provost
and the chancellor had to make,”

.Masoner said, adding that the

reviewcommittee did not_ make the
final decision. t

In ‘response to the allegations
from Chapman, Masoner reaffirm-
ed that he thought there was “a
very careful, exacting process that
was followed that identiﬁed a
lengthy list of very able candidates
and nominees. . .”/

. Chapman Maintains Allegations

But despite statements to the con-
trary from Bozik, Smith, and
Masoner, Chapman maintained his
allegation “as to whether or not a
genuine search was conducted.”

Chapman described Bozik’s
response to his memo, originally

published in the University Times, '

as “evasive and unresponsive.”
“Dr. Bozik simply affirms here

that a genuine search was in fact

conducted. He does not reply to

my point that the timing of the ap-_
pointment raises serious doubts,”

Chapman said.

“Nor does he make any reference

in the University Times piece to my

point that I was unable to locate the‘

ad in the Careers in Education sec-
tion,” Chapman added.

In the case of Smith’s reply, con-
tained in a Pitt News interview: “I
notice again there's no direct
response to my timingof the ap-
pointment, a decisive considera-
tion. And again there is no

reference to my point that I was ‘

unable to locate the ad in the proper
place.”

Chapman said that if anything,‘
the “force of his recommendation”
was increased by the “evasive

responses” of Bozik, and Smith, _

“and their “failure to place an adver-

$!$V/%V&!

tisement in The New York Times.”

Chapman said he would “like to
remind the chancellor that his is the
responsibility for the integrity of
our appointive process, and that in

my opinion he has clearly failed to .

discharge that responsibility.

“If he is not prepared to
discharge this responsibility—which

is his, it’s not Bozik’s, it’s not _

Smith’s—indeed it’s his supreme
responsibility. And if he is not
prepared to discharge this respon-

sibility, then his only honorable‘

course is resignation,” ‘Chapman
said. '

Chapman is recommending that
the chancellor “remove the incum-'
bent from office, appoint an acting
director, and institute a new and
thorough search with a view to ap-
poiptment of, a director in

September, 1981 .”

I Just Wait
  And See

Gov. Richard Thornburgh has adopted a “wait I

and see” attitude toward possible cuts in appropria-

'_ tions brought on by the repeal of Liquor-Control

the liquor prices as being illegal.

If the court decision is not reversed, Thornburgh
will be forced to cut $33.5 million from appropria-
tions originally slated to go the way of the state-
related universities.

“That (the ‘LCB revenue) is the majority of the
funds we were going to use to pay the deficit for the
state-relateds,” according to Thornburgh budget
spokesman, Nick DeBenedictus.

The Liquor Control was committed to formulating
policy to help the state-related schools, after it re-
neged on _a plan to. provide $26 million to the Com-
monwealth through a 10 cent a bottle surcharge.

“The LCB did it (increased prices) and lived up to
their commitment DeBenedictus said. “But, a‘ judge

has" said they didn’t do it properly.”

DeBenedictus, is uncertain how the saga of the Li-
quor Control Board vs the Commonwealth court will
end. ‘

What’s more, he is uncertain what. the fate of
students from the four state-related universities will
be if te ruling is upheld. ’

But it doesn’t take much guessing'on our part to
realize what that fate is._

We’ve heard it all before.

Just like last year and the five years that preceeded,

counterparts.

And each year we ask ourselves why, as residents
of Pennsylvania, we are forced to pay outrageous tui-
tion and fees for an education ‘that is no better than
that received by those West Virginia students.

But each year we return to Pitt, and each year we
pay those precious tuition dollars.

We are held hostage here at a university that drains
us of our last dollars.

But some of us will pass our frustration on to
younger brothers and sisters who someday will face
the question of whether to attend a Pennsylvania
school or not. I

We could convince those younger siblings to attend
a_ Pennsylvania school because of the quality educa-
tion received within.

But maybe by that time, when those brothers and
sisters are ready for "college, it maybe unusual for a
Pennsylvania resident to attend a school in his or her
state. «.

It could be that Pennsylvanians may be “priced
out” of their own state by extraordinary tuition
costs.

By LARRY LUNSFORD _
_ As soon as the news broke that
 ’ Iraq and Iran had begun an
“undeclared war on each other, the
It first reaction on the part of many
‘Americans was to cheer the Iraqis.
’ Iran has caused humiliation for the

 
   
  
   

 :now, and any threat to the insane

3 rule of the Ayatollah Khomeini

comes as a welcome to most

American people.

L Although it is easy to side with

.5‘fIraq in this recent war with

;~_‘?. neighboring Iran, the threat to

 world peace seems greater if the

,5; "war continues. This is a war‘that

"' ’ offers no ‘ = victor, particularly

1 the Unitel. states.

I,» I This newest conflict only adds to
gt the growing chaos that has been
‘l 7 developing in, this volatile region
. 5 since the fall of the shah in January,

.3-11979. Iran has yet to stabilize its
fgovernment since the return of the
ffayatollah and, rather than
3  strengthening, things appear to be
«worsening even further. This war
‘ _[with Iraq, the only positive aspect
"of which is further unity for the
isolated Iranian people, "can only
;g_i.dVto the deterioration.

  
   
   
  
   
  

Although relations between the
Islamic regime of the ayatollah and,
the secular government of Iraq's
Saddam’ Hussein have never been
good, they hit a low point last year
when Iran began broadcasting"ap-
peals to the Iraqui Shi’ites to over-
throw the “satanic” rule of the
U.S. and Israeli “puppets” in
Baghdad. The Iraqui regime is run
almost enti .:ly by Moslems of the
Sunni "sect. Khomeini is a Shia
Moslem with a potent appeal to the
largely Shi'ite population of
southern Iraq.

This war with Iran is most likely
welcomed by Hussein in that he has
attempted to make his country the
leader of the Arab world since Ir-
an's collapse and the isolation of
Egypt following its ' peace with
Israel. Hussein has been partially
successful in his bid for power due
to his wooing of-European nations,
particularly Italy and France, and
the fact that Iraq "is the world’s se-
cond major oil exporter, with 3.5
million barrels daily. Iraq’§
geographic location also favors its
quest for power, and the revolu-
tionary. Hussein has built a strong

 

 

. army which can both threaten and

protect the region.

Hussein has played his ‘cards
calmly and cautiously. In 1978,
most of the Arab countries attended
a summit meeting in Baghdad and
joined Iraq in condemning Egypt’s
separate peace with Israel. A pro-
gram for unity between Syria and
Iraq was initiated. Common oil
policies were worked out with Saudi
Arabia and, last year Hussein issued
an eight-point Arab charter, design-
ed to hold Russia and the United
States out of the Persian Gulf,
while casting Iraq in the lead role as
the protecting power of the area. ‘

So much propaganda is flowing
out about the war between Iran and
Iraq that it is still too early to make
a full and accurate judgement of
Iraq's power. It does seem evident,
however, that Hussein has en-
countered more resistance and a
stronger Iranian army than he had

‘planned. There appears to be

nothing like a common enemy
which can draw the Iranian people
together.

‘ Although the United States and

her allies havea selﬁsh reason for I

wanting the war to stop—that being
to preserve the oil flow from the
Persian Gulf—‘, there doesn’t ap-

Last spring the board or trustees
passed a Student ‘Government
Board proposal doubling the long-
standing $12.00 undergraduate stu-
dent activity fee. The extra money
resulting from this action was to be
used in part to strengthen the scope
and quality of student-oriented pro-
gramming at Pitt.

The Pitt Program Council has
responded to this challenge by
presenting to Pitt a calendar of
events for this fall which is un-
precedented in both quantity and
quality. Vincent Price, Andrew
Young, Spyro Gyra, and Mel Blanc
highlight a fall schedule that in-
cludes an impressive list of ﬁlms,
theatre, concerts, and lectures, as
well as Homecoming Activities.
Thanks to the student activity fee,
these events arepresented to non-

CGS undergraduates. free-of-_

charge, or occasionally for a
nominal fee. It is student money
that makes these events possible,
and we would like the students to
know what they are paying for._ ‘
The Pitt News, however, has
been an obstacle to these efforts.
Virtually all pre-event publicity in
The Pitt News is paid for by the

receive from The Pitt News is in the
form of reviews—after the fact.
Reviews are nice to read but they
don’t help the student who missed
the event because he didn’t know
about it.

Andrew Young spoke at Pitt on
September 23. As this was a special
occasion, The Pitt News made an

_exception and brieﬂy announced

Mr. Young’s appearance prior to
the event. No mention was made,
however, of the” sponsoring
organization.

In The Pitt News review of the
lecture three days after the event,
no less than 700 words were devoted

to the event, once again with ab-
solutely no mention of the Program
Council. Would a journalist write
a responsible article covering the
presidential debates without men-
tioning that they were sponsored by
the League of Women Voters?
After reading The Pitt News, one
gets the impression that Mr. Young

simply materialized on stage. In -’

fact, Pitt undergraduates, through
the Pitt Program Council, spon-
sored Mr. Young’s visit. That is
why they were admitted free-of-
charge. Incidentally, over 1500
people listened to Andrew Young
on Tuesday night, not the grossly

inaccurate ﬁgure of 400 reported by
The Pitt News.

The Program Council does not
expect to receive free adverstising in
The Pitt News. We are already the
single most frequent student adver-
tiser, spending thousands of student
dollars to advertise student pro-
grams.
The Pitt News is a little respect and
some cooperation. We serve the
same clientele. We are both fund-
ed, at least in part, by thevstudents.‘
Therefore, we each have a respon-
sibility to those students. We would

their obligation by describing up-

reviewing these events, thereby
keeping the students informed
about the programs they subsidize.
A great deal of money has been
‘invested by the Pitt Program Coun-
cil in arranging a complete calendar
of events for this term. Each stu-
dent has a monetary stake in these
events. We hope that The Pitt
News will work with us to insure
that every student knows what he is
getting for his money.

Texas defeated a relatively weak Oregon State

team by a score of 35-0. Impressive, right? But Pitt
won its game 36-2 over- a similarly weak Temple
team. Thus, how the voters could vault the
Longhorns past the Panthers in the poll is beyond
belief.
‘ Because the poll is taken by writers from around
the country (UPI is the coaches’ poll), it has become
a popularity contest. Teams with the big names and
traditions are usually the benefactors of the vote.
Schools in the south, mid—west, and far-west have
hadithe big following through the years.

_Even the most uninterested person is aware that
USC, Oklahoma, Texas, Notre Dame, Alabama, and
Ohio State are nationally-known football

P powerhouses. So when the time comes to vote, the

writers in Southern California, Oklahoma, Texas,

 

the country, the name schools receive the most votes.

When a "good ole boy down in Texas sees that his
Longhorns won by 35 points and that the city—slickers
in Pittsburgh only won by 34, he will vote Texas over
Pitt all the time.
teams.

When Pitt played Boston College to open the year, ,

the writers who vote for AP were disappointed that
the Panthers didn’t stomp all over “lowly”'BC. Only
problem is that the writers from the south and west
assumed that the Eagles were as bad as they were in
the past; that was BC’s reputation. They figured that
there was no chance that Boston had improved, so
the highly-ranked_Panthers suffered.

As soon as Ohio State beat Syracuse 31-21, not im-
pressive by any means, the mid-west writers im-
mediately boosted the Buckeyes to number one.

     

The same happens with others‘

didn’t seem to matter that the number two, three,
and four teams all won their bowl games with similar
case. There was no way Notre Dame should have
won the championship.

When Southern Calbeat Michigan 17-10 in the
Rose Bowl in 1979, and Alabama defeated Penn
State 14-7, the polls split the title between the two.
The discrepancy stemmed from the number-three
Trojans jumping into a tie with the number—two

The problem with the poll is that all the deserving
teams don’t always get a fair shake. {For what it is
worth, this reporter believes there is no way any team

Pcintherett
Sweep Tournament

By SCOT STONE
Pitt News Sport Writer

The Pantherette volleyball squad
beat six teams in a row last weekend
to win the Temple Invitational. In
the ﬁnal match against Rutgers,
Pitt played down to the wire in a
best-of-ﬁve match, winning the last
game, 15-13.

The Rutgers squad is tall and
powerful and, according to Shelton
Collier, coach oﬂthe Pitt team, they
have consistently been rated as one
oathe top three teams in the East.
Along with Georgetown they are

the greatest threat to Pantherette '

regional domination.

“Rutgers was a challenge,”
Collier said.‘ “We were down two-
games-to—one in the fourth and we
were losing. I think that the team
just looked at themselves and found
something deep inside to win the
match with.”

According to Collier, the final
game of the match with Rutgers was
a “classic volleyball game,”
characterized by long rallies. "

“That was a tough one. A lot of
people thought we were going to
lose it at that point,” Collier said.
“They were at the top of their

was our bench strength,” Collier
said. “We had 12 ‘players that we
pulled into crucial situations, and
they all contributed.”

Substitutes were used according
to the player’s particular specialty.
Two outstanding subs, according to
Collier, were Tina Newton, a
server, and Ieva Berzins, a blocker.

An unexpected challenge
developed in the quarter-finals
against Maryland. They won the

second game in a best-of-three.

match, with a score of 9-15.‘ But
Pitt returned in the third game to
win it, 16-14. g _

“V_\j'e were expecting them to play
well and they did,” Collier said. “It
turned into a tight game but we won
it. '

“One thing that I'm surprised at
in these encounters is a growing
cohesiveness among the team
members,” Collier said. “We are
maturing as a unit.”

“We’re becoming very steady,
and consistently winning those tight
games that go down to the wire,”
Collier said. “It’s a sign of the
team’s experience playing together
as a unit.”

  WOMEN. YOU’RE EQUAL
  A IN THE AIR FORCE.

Women start out on the same footing as men in Air Force
ROTC. Women wear the same insignia and holdethe same
cadet positions in AFROTC, just as they do later on as Air
Force officers. ,

And the same AFROTC scholarship can be yours as a
woman. If you qualify, you can have your tuition. book costs
and lab fees paid by the Air Force. and receive $100 a month
for other expenses. It helps free you to concentrate on your
education. And that's’ important.

As an Air Force officer, you'll be expected to use your train-

1‘ ing and education, and be a leader managing people and
complex systems. You'll be handed executive responsibility
starting with your first job. .

Its a great way to be equal, and a great way to serve your
country. Check into the AFROTC program a-t your campus.
Be sure to ask about AFROTC scholarships — you may be

two is Loneliest Number for Football Score .      

Two. That number is the worst to have as a foot-
ball score, except perhaps for five.
Panther football team defeated the Temple Owls,
36-2. Sounds like a grade school basketball score,
doesn’t it.? ’

Now the Panthers never should have given up that
safety to begin with but, as coach Jackie Sherrill said,
“It’s just one of those things.” i

In the very early days of Pitt football, a dumb
score was a lot easier to come by. Pitt had previously
won‘\,and lost games by scores of 10-4, 6-4, 6-2, 44-2
and 4-0. However, in modern Pitt football (since
1912), there have been fewer and fewer of these types
of scores. *

In fact, not since 1947 has/Pitt played in a game
which ended up with a score of two, four or five. The
Panthers lost to West Virginia in that game, 17-2.
Speaking of the "score of five, Pitt, in its long football
history, has never been involved in a game with a
score of five in it.

Pitt has also played in some pretty bizarre scoring
games in its time. Take the 1977 76-0 win over Tem-
ple as an example. That was only the third most lop-
sided win for a Panther team. In 1926, the Panthers

beat up on Westminster College,'88-0. But the biggie
was Pitt’s\l9l4 murder of Dickinson as the “Cats”
won the contest 96-0.

There is no way that today’s Pitt team could be in-
volved in a contest like the 1965' battle with the
Mountaineers of West Virginia. The game was an
out-and-out hillbilly-city boy shoot-out with the Pan-
thers windin" gup on the short side of a‘ 63-48
score—a real defensive struggle, huh? _

Anyhow, back to the original -point. Why is a safe-
ty worth two points anyway? For a defensive team to

6 score’ a safety is the ultimate. Except for a runback

of an interception, a safety is the only way the defen-
sive team can score. That ought to be worth at least
as much as a field goal. _

“ Besides, if asafety were worth three points, those
dumb scores of two, four, and five would never have
to be written about again.

The statistics are out for the first three games of T‘

the season and Pitt performers look impressive.
After a big game on Saturday, freshman Joe McCall
is now leading the Panthers in average yards rushing.
McCall has carried the ball 20 times for 109 yards
and an average of 5.5 yards per carry. Randy
McMillan leads the team in total rushing yardage
with 155 yards on 41 attempts for an average of 3.8
and one touchdown. ‘

Benjie Pryor has the lead in pass receiving with 12
catches for 133 yards and three touchdowns. Dan
Marino leads the team in passing with 49 completions

on 96 attempts for a percentage of .510. He has pass- ..

ed for 611 yards and seven touchdowns.

Lynn Thomas leads, the defense in interceptions
with three, while Terry White and Sal Sunseri each
have two picked-off passes. Hugh Green leads the
defense in tackles with 19 and 10 assists. Green has
four sacks and has recovered two ‘fumbles.

Pitt News Staff Writer

Western Psychiatric Insititute
*1 Clinic (WPIC) was recently
awarded a $1 million grant for a
three-year study of the “effec-
tiveness and safety of various
treatments for major depressive
disorders . ’ ’

It is estimated that 20 percent of
all Americans suffer from some
depressive disorder at some point in
their lives.

The 36-month study will involve
six universities in the U.S. and
Canada. Rush-Presbyterian, St.
Luke’s Medical Center, Yale
$iversity, and the University of

estern Ontario will train the
research therapists, while Pitt,
George Washington University, and
the University of Oklahoma will
conduct the clinical research.

Pitt’s part of the project will be
directed by Dr. Stanley Imber. Im-
ber will direct a team of
psychiatrists, psychologists, phar-
matherapists, and clinicians.

“Dr. Imber’s reputation as an
internationally-know pioneer of
psychotherapy research and our
(W estern Psych) track record as one
of the top clinical research centers
in the country,” said Dr. Thomas
Detre, director of the institute’s'
department of psychiatry, “were
decisive factors in designating

-_dVestern Psych to conduct this

milestone research porgram. ’ ’
Prior to joining Pitt faculty five

years ago, Imber ‘was involved in '

the Psychotherapy Research Pro-
ject at Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine. A 25-year
study of the effective ingredients of
psychotherapy was conducted by
the Project and the results were
published in a book called The Ef-
fective Ingredients of Successful
Psychotherapy written by V Imber
and Dr. Jerome Frank.

Two of the most common short-

\ term psychotherapy treatments
_ have been selected for study.

One, cognitive-behavior therapy,
is based on the theory that underly-
ing depression are faulty or
distorted thinking patterns. The
goal of therapy is the correction,

through joint examination by the '

patient and therapist,_ of these
thinking patterns.

The other treatment, interper-
sonal therapy, is based on the no-

tion of a strong relationship bet-
ween interpersonal disturbances
and depression. Interpersonal
therapy is intended to assist patients
to understand and improve social
functioning and problems in in-
terpersonal relationships- associated
with depression.

‘Also included in the study are
three comparison and/or control
treatment conditions: first, treat-
mentvusing anti-depressant drugs in
conjunction with routine clinical

management; second, use of a ’

placebo (a substance having no
pharmacological effect) and clinical
management; and third,
“treatment-as-usual,” in which a
separate group of therapists will
provide psychotherapy to their pa-
tients as they would in their ususal
practice.

The collaborative program has
been designed by the National In-
stitute .of Mental Health staff and
advisers to allow comparability of
results among the research centers;
Each research therapist will receive
intensive training in one of the
treatments under study to assure
uniform therapeutic practice.

“It is a systematic study with a
careful scientific design.” noted
Imber.‘ “The collaborative design
will draw a large and representative
sample of patients and allow for
greater certainty in analysis of the
study.”

Other studies have shown
psychotherapy to be effective,
therefore, the significance of this
study is the major. advance it
represents in the “sophistication of
the treatment research questions.”
In addition to proving psycotherapy
effective, it is hoped that the study
will point out _,what forms of
therapy work most effectively and
quickly for what patients under
what conditions. ‘ -

Detre pointed out that the study
is not highly technical by nature and
that the majority of the $1 million
grant is earmarked for the training
and compensation of researchers.

Finally, in another respect, the
study is viewed as a pilot study that
will lead to more specific studies
three years from now.

However, the goal will still re-
main the same-—the quickest and
most effective treatment for an in-
dividual suffering from a depres-

'Robitics institute’ to be housedion Federal Mines site

  

. ‘ -

By MIKE MALLINGER
Pitt News Staff Writer

Carnegie-Mellon University is
entering the 21st century, pioneer-
ing with robots that could have a
profound effect on everyone’s
future. _ -

The university plans to buy the
ten-building Federal Bureau of
Mines site adjacent to CMU’s cam-
pus on Forbes Avenue. The com-
plex will house CMU’s Robotics In-
stitute. ’

Robots are already at work in
automobile factories, spot welding
and spray painting, predominately
in Japanese auto plants. The se-
cond generation of robots will give
the American manufacturer the
competitive edge.

Final approval of the sale is con-
tingent upon a United States Senate

' vote. A bill authored in the Senate
by Sen. John Heinz and in the
House by Rep. William S.
Moorhead, passed the House on a
voice vote. - -

The Carter administration, ac-

. cording to Moorhead’s office, is

not taking a stand on the bill,
though earlier it was reported that
the administration had not backed
the bill because the selling price,
$5.4 million, was not.sufficient.

One problem, said Moorhead’s
representative, is that the union
representing the workers has com-
plained that it is not getting a “fair
shake.” Relocation of the Federal
Bureau of Mines to Bruceton, 25
miles away, will place a hardship on
some commuting workers.

The university has been trying to
buy the 10-building site since 1957.
Delays, apart from the bill’s being

. bogged down in the Senate, include
adminstrative delays, legal paper

CMU Dean of Engineering Dan
Berg said some refurbishing and
some demolition will take place.

“The whole system is 5 to 30,

years off,” he added.

Provisions of the bill specify that
the Mine Safety and Health Divi-
sion of the Mine’s Bureau will re-

The-Robotics Institute may have

levels of motivation for employees,
increased quality of goods, and in-
