11 Tournament

Vaughn Wallace /Staff Photographer

Pitt's Shavonte Zellous is hoping to finish out her senior season in a positive way for. ‘
the Panthers. Zellous and Pitt advanced, to the Sweet 16 last season.

H‘ by  Steiner
Staﬂ Wrrter

When Shavonte Zellous came to‘ Pitt ﬁve '
‘years ago, the Pitt women’s- basketball team that
‘she joined was an entirely different program.

Duiing the 2003-04 season, when Pitt recruited

gZellous and coach Agnus Berenato made her

debut, the Panthers went 6-20 overall and 2-14
intheBigEast   - . - P _

Zellous_ was redshirted in the next season,
and Pitt was 13-15, 5.11 in the Big East.

_“\X/hen Coach B. came to my ‘open  in
Florida, they said 1 could help rebuild this pro-
gram,” ‘said Zellous. “Then I saw how‘ many
wins they had. I had to have blind fai .”

The change in ‘Pitt women’s basketball

emerged as soon as seniors Zellous and Xe-
.nia Stewart stepped on the ﬂoor. During their
freshman season, they helped lead Pitt to its
first  record (22-11, 9-7) since 1999-
2000. As soplriornores, the two led the Panthers

o~

to their first NCAA Tournament, which Pitt-I
-. hosted. ' ' '

As juniors, they made ‘it to the Sweet 16.

_And-neither want to stop now.

“We’ye been to four ‘straight postseasons,”

said Berenato. “We have another banner to.

add, and" I think [Stewart and Zellous] really
bought into the whole adage that we wanted to
have a great program, Both have been starters
for four straight years. They’Ve helped to build
the program. I just think the numbers speak for
themselves.” : » . I _ ‘

While a good portion of Pitt students
ventured south to_ Panama City, Fla, for their
yearly spring break vacation, a sizable selec-
tion headed north to New York City for the
Big East tournament. -

The Oakland Zoo ﬁlled its student sec-
tion in one corner of the legendary Madison
Square Garden in Manhattan for Pitt’s only
game of the tournament, at 74-60 loss to rival
West Virginia. '

However, student sections at the Garden

- are in New York for the tournament.

“I always treat New York like a business
trip for basketball,” said Jedlicka. “We went
to the Garden and hung out and tried to get
tickets for a couple of fnends who needed
them, which is usually what I end up doing.”

It’s not exactly a short voyage to the Big
Apple for Pitt students, but several options
exist to travel and watch the tournament
mayhem.

It takes about seven hours to reach New
York City by car and only about one hour by
plane. Buses and trains are other modes of
transportation that could be cheaper than the

conventional methods.

sealed at the end of regulation, and

ray-less Market Central saves food, cash

by Mary Hancock
Staﬂ IV/‘ire/'

After days of collecting messy
leftovers, Pitt’s environmental club,
Free the Planet, estimated that Mar-
ket Central would reduce food waste
by nearly 30,000 pounds each year if

Sodexo took away meal trays.

The club contrasted how much
food students threw away on days
they had trays and on trayless days.
Members discovered that students
eating in Market Central waste 29,600
pounds a year Additionally, each din-
ing student wastes an approximated

16.5 pounds of food annually.

The calculations present a mini-
mum statistic because the data was
limited to food wasted during dinner
and lunch hours Mondays through
Fiidays. So the results exclude break-
fast every day and weekends altogeth-
er, which would have added to the

overall food waste totals, said Free the
Planet’s secretaryjessica Herbe. ,
Some studenm might have noticed
that the study inadvertently collected
inedible pineapple rinds and bones.
Volunteers realized the problem
quickly but continued the method to
remain consistent throughout the en-

tire study. Because the inedible food

was reliably collected, the results still‘

reflect a difference in waste between
days with and without trays that
would not be influenced by this error,
said Herbe

The study also notes that trays
lead to wasted water because each

Students travel to NYC for career fair‘  

. alumni of all the Big East schools

by Tamara Braunstein

Staﬁ’ Writer

NEW/YORK—Alow number of
sign—ups forced Pitt to cancel a char-
tered tiip to New York City for the
Big East Conference Career Fair last
weelg but that didn’t stop some Pitt
students from attending

The Student Employment and
PlacementAssistance office scheduled
a week of career-building events with
professionals from various ﬁelds in
New York City leading up to Fridays
fair, which is one of the largest career-
networking events ir1 the country.'The
annual fair is open to students and

Despite the low turnout for the
week-long event, about 80 Pitt stu-
dents still registered to attend the
career  said Matthew Galmoff a
Student Employment and Placement
Assistant Office employee and Big
East Career Fair representative

The $399 cost of the trip would
have included round—tiip bus trans-
portation and hotel After the
cancellation, students had to find their
own ways to the fair.

On the day of the event, thousands
of students from across the 16 Big
East schools rushed the convention
ﬂoors of Madison Square Garden.

Attendees perused booths of
more than 100  organizations
for full-time, part—time and internship
positions

Recent Pitt graduate Wmny Zhu,
a part-time bookkeeper in the fashion
industry, said she left the event feeling
positive about the experience.

“Overall it was OK. I mostiy was
looking for jobs in New York, in the
government or finance [sectors]  I re-
searched the companies before I came
here, and it went well,” said Zhu.

Ivy Blazevic, a senior business
and finance major, also felt conﬁdent
about her interaction with employers.

“I snuck a  at some of the

stuff they were  on my re-
sumes, and it seemed pretty good,”
she said.

Other students and alumni came
just to see what the fair had to offer.

Michael Stahl, a Pitt alumnusfrom
the class of 1975, has been in New
York for 10years, 
and ﬁnance

“I have a job, I just want to see
what else is out there,” he said.

This was the conferences fifth live
career fair The Big East also sponsors
an annual e—fair, a virtual career fair
that allows students to browse career
opportunities from their homes -

For music lovers looking for a
band with a unique sound and laid-
back style, it’s time to set religious be-
liefs aside and hop aboard the Steam-
ship Jesus

W The Pittsburgh band was  its
eyebrow-raising name by a man who
heard it playing The  Stones’
song “Sympathy for the Devil” one
night in Schenley Plaza. \

He exclaimed that rather than
pitying Lucifer, the musicians ought
to “get on the Steamship Jesus,” in-
spiring one of the Pittsburgh music
scene’s more unusual band names.

Pitt alumni Tom  Iggy
Marcinkevicius and Carnegie Mellon
alumnus Mike DeLuca began playing
together casually as an acoustic trio in

“Originally, we had no intentions
of starting a band,” said bassist and
vocalist Marcinkevicius. “Our friends
just started _ saying we would [be]
good”

The band members have wide
and eclectic music tastes, resulting in
a sound that draws inﬂuences from
genres such as folk, indie, blues and

. rock.

Vocalist and guitarist DeLuca de-
sciibed the band’s sound as “using
force only when necessary. A lot of
bands punch it up just to punch it up.
We don’t always look to do that.”

A great meal involves more
than just the food on your plate.
It’s the whole experience of wait-
ers bringing steaming dishes, the
hubbub of guests moving, clinking
glasses and talking. -

When my date and I got inside
the BYOB restaurant Legends of
the North Shore, everyone was en-
grossed in coversation. The waiter
brought focaccia bread to the table,
and I tried to drown the conversa-
tion in olive oil.

The restaurant has the setup of
an old—time diner, with an exposed
kitchen surrounded by a crowded
dining area of about 20 tables. Res-
ervations are recommended and
not always easy to make. Gourmet
pizzas and calzones dot the menu,
and pasta with red marinara sauce,
or “mama’s gravy,” let us know we
were in the safe hands of an Italian
matriarch.

The name, Legends, references

selves,” said DeLuca. «was looking
to have ﬁm. Not  a genre can

, work to our beneﬁt”

But not ﬁtting into a category
gives the band a disadvantage, too.

“Stylistically, it’s hard to ﬁnd bands
to share a bill wi ” said Smetanka,
the drummer. Despite this, the band
has managed, playing frequently at 10-
cal venues including Spice Cafe and
Jekyll & Hyde’s The band usually can
get along with whatever group it plays

with, aside from one instance when it

wasbilledwithagroup 
in Japanese —- a style with which the
band didn’t really mesh.

Steamship Jesus’ unintentional
rebellion, defying conventions and
splicing genres, creates a sound of its
own. 

“In our heads were just playing
what feels good and sounds right,”

Pittsburgh sports history. Pictures
of the Immaculate Reception hang
right next to a shrine to Bill Maze-
roski. This restaurant is deﬁnitely
Pittsburgh.

Focaccia finished, my date and I
decided to try the mussel appetizer
($8.95). Legends prepares mussels
in a red sauce. The mussels looked
good, but on ﬁrst taste they failed
the test. The spices were overpow-
ering. Everything tasted musty,
burnt almost from the
blend of too much garlic
and oregano.

My date and I went
with the Cajun mahi—ma-
hi, blackened on top of
polenta and garnished
with an olive tapenade
($20). It was a special of the day,
and given Legends’ proximity to
theﬁsh markets, I was hoping for
a fresh catch. We were in luck.

The ﬁsh was perfectly cooked,
ﬂaking off and bringing  it
Cajun spices and a great Mediter-
ranean tapenade. The polenta cre-
ated ‘a nice base for the citrus of
the olives and the Cajun spices. A

We balanced the ﬁsh with

said DeLuca. “The ironyinthatis that

while we’re not  to be i t,
somehow we are.”
But in the current Pittsburgh mu-

sic scene, Steamship Jesus members
said that  different isn’t so dif-
ﬁcult,thankstoalargenumberof
sound-alike bands playing dated ma-
terial.

“It’s easy to replicate the ’70s
idols,” said Smetanka. “A lot of bands
are heavily inﬂuenced by older music
but aren’t  to create something
new from those inﬂuences”

But the band is not above playing
covers for the sake of entertaining an
audience, or even indulgingthe one
jerk who always asks for “Free Bird.”

“We’re not brilliant enough yet to
be cocky,” said DeLuca.

“When we look out and people
are into it, that makes us into it,” said

 

a pricy spin on Italian

something straight out of mamabtj,

kitchen: penne alla vodka ($14.95),
a creamy vodka sauce ﬂavored
with prosciutto, Italian ham, spicy
red pepper and garlic. Although
the sauce was thinner than I like,
it had some great flavors. The pro-
sciutto really came out and wasn’t
overpowered by the garlic and
other spices.

We passed on dessert, instead
enjoying a cup of coffee and ﬁn-
ishing our bottle of
wine ($2 per glass cork-
ing fee).

Overall, Leg-
ends is an Italian diner.
The specials are insight-
ful and interesting, but
it’s not gourmet. It’s

comfort food for a price that you
» should get gourmet.

Thankfully, there is a tem-
edy for the high prices. Monday

through Thursday, the restauranig"

offers discounts. Thursday is ladies
night, and for $15, ladies can get a
full meal. On Wednesday, the res-
taurant ‘ double a pasta portion,

Important as their music is to

“We didn’t start playing music to

Will Pitt ﬁnally reaehthe Final Four?

Fields will lead the
Panthers to Detroit

by Evan Burgos
Staﬂ Writer

Congratulations, Pitt basket-
ball fans, your team is headed to
the Final Four. Now I know we’re
still weeks away from Detroit, but
I felt like it was my responsibility
to get it out of the way and tell
you guys now.

Happy? You should be. What’s
that you say? Thank you? Oh,
please, don’t thank me. I’m just
the messenger. You should be
thanking someone else. Can you
guess who it is?

OK, I’ll give you some hints.
He’s about 5 feet 10 inches tall —
err, at least that’s what your game
program says, but he’s probably a
little smaller than that. He’s got

 
        
       
       

these really cool braids I’ve been
trying to copy for a few years but
can’t seem to make work. Oh, and

he wears No. 2.

’ Unless you go to a branch
campus or haVen’t been anywhere
near Pittsburgh in the last two
years, you should have guessed
the guy I’m talking about is Le-
Vance Fields, the air-tight point
guard who will take the Panthers
to the Final Four for the first time
since 1941 and for only the sec-
ond time in school history.

Fields is one part of Pitt’s
three—headed monster with De-
Juan Blair and Sam Young. Al-
though Blair has snared most of
the national attention paid to the
Panthers this year, and Young
ﬁgures to be a first-round pick in
this ]une’s NBA Draft, look no
further than Pitt’s backcourt for

Pitt's N 0. 1 spot

Pitt coach Jamie Dixon addresses reporters yesterday after Pitt was
armounced as the No. 1 seed in the east region.

The Pitt News 0 wvvw.pittnews.com

A Selection, page 2

the East Tennessee State Buccaneers,
who received a No. 16 seed as tour-
nament champions of the Atlantic
Sun Conference ‘

The two teams had one common
opponent this season: the Belmont
Bruins, who the Panthers defeated
74-60 on Nov 25. The Buccaneers
went 2-1 against Belmont this year,
including a 30-point blowout win on
Jan. 19.

While the Panthers are relatively
unfarniliar with the Buccaneers at this
point, the next few days will be spent
studying how they play.

‘‘\We’re going to learn a lot about
them tomorrow, and we’re going to
watch some ﬁlm,” said senior for-
ward Tyrell Biggs.

As the top seed in their bracket,
the Panthers will once again have a
No. 1 next to their name, and they
feel ready for that challenge after ex-

bull’s—eye on their backs on two sepa-
rate occasions this year.
“I think being No. 1 already this

season is a good thing because we’ve

periencing what it’s like to have the A

been there and dealt with [the] so-
called pressure," said freshman guard
Ashton Gibbs. ''We’re in that spot
again, so we just have to live up to it
now." A

Pitt wasn’t the only Big East mem— ,
bet to earn a‘ No. 1 seed. Conference
regular—season and V tournament
champions Louisville was named the
top overall seed in the NCAA Tour-
nament and will play in the Midwest
region. Louisville’s first two games
are in Dayton, as well.

Connecticut grabbed the top
seed in the West bracket. Although
the Huskies lost their ﬁnal two games
to Pitt and then Syracuse in the Big
East tournament, they received the
last No. 1 spot just ahead of Mem-
phis. The Tigers are the second seed
in Connecticufs region.

This is the first time three teams
from one conference earned No. 1
seeds in the NCAA Tournament;

North Carolina received the other
No. 1 seed in the South bracket;

The East bracket is filled with
teams the Panthers are familiar with,

March 16, 2009

is best in team's history

as they have played seven teams in
their bracket over the past few sea-
sons. '

Pitt has squared off against No.
3—seed Villanova and No. 5-seed
Florida State just this season while
facing teams such as No. 2-seed
Duke and possible second—round op-
ponent No. 8—seed Oklahoma State
last season.

Pitt knocked off Florida State in
a low-scoring, 56-48 slugfest on Dec;
21, but lost in its only meeting with
Villanova this year on the road, 67-57.
Meanwhile, Pitt defeated both Duke
and Oklahoma State in 2007-08.

Another  potential
matchup for the Panthers could
come in the Elite Eight, when they
could square off against No. 6—seed
UCLA andformer Pitt coach Ben
Howland.

But the Panthers aren’t looking
ahead right now, as they know that
they have to take one game at a time.

“We have to worry about East
Tennessee State first,” said sopho-
more guard Brad \7(/anamaker.

an inside presence to go with an
outside presence, you’re going to
be tough to beat.”

Last season, Pitt had experi-
enced performersin the front-
court and the backcourt, with
Marcedes Walker controlling the
inside. -

With that combination of in-
side and outside performers, the
Panthers advanced toithe Sweet
16. . . . '

This year, “Wilson i must pro-
vide the inside force to Pitt’s vet-
eran guard play.

. If Wilson continues to per-
form as she did against top—5
Louisville, the Panthers will likely
have a good shot to advance in
the tournament. L

Panthers look to use more aggression in coming weeks

Seniors, page l3

I Now, as the two lead their team to its third
NCAA Tournament, neither knows what
game will be their last with the team that they
have so signiﬁca_ntly helped to change. _

“If it wasnjt for this team, [Stewart and I]
wouldn’t be who we are,” said Zellous. ‘Tm
just going to give it my‘all, because with every
possession it could be all over.” .

She certainly gave it her all in the Big East
tournament, despite_losing to Louisville in the
semiﬁnals. Zellous was the only player" named
to the all—tournament team who didn’t play for
a team in the ﬁnal game. She scored .18 points

_ against l_)ePaul in the quarterﬁnals and 24

points in the semiﬁnals.

Zellous was also named to the all-Big East
first team for the third time and is the only Pan-
ther to do so. '

She and Stewart have the same goal going 0

into the NCAA Tournament that the rest of .
their team, and maybe every other team, does:
win a national title. ‘ - '

Cuse-UCgonn‘ to 1

This was especially evident on Thursday night,
when Big East rivals collided, such as Connecticut

vs Syracuse and Pitt'vs West Virginia As teams.

u

battled on the court, fans bicke_red in the stands _l
And these conversations did not stay within Mad-

ison Square Garden. _ _

1 New York ‘City bars and restaurants enjoy
extra business during tournament time, and bas-
ketball fans have places to take their interaction
Many of these businesses cater to the Big East
crowds by  banners for the conference
and  team logos on their windows The
conversations outside the arena are perhaps the
most memorable, and enjoyable, aspect of the
tournament ’ ‘ , -

Strangers, whose only connection is that they
share afavoiite team or conference, end up talk-
ing for hours about the Big East season and the
tournament After ﬁve days, these outlets become
places for college basketball fans to talk hoops
with hundreds of their closest friends

To fans of the Big East, the conference tour-
nament is a paradise Madison Square Garden is
home to someof the greatest sports" moments in
history, and the game between Syracuse and Con-
necticut was added to the list last week.

Thegame'—tl1eweeke1id—hadtl1e feel
of a championship, es N on Thursday night,

when Orange and Huskies fans debated in the." H

stands as their teams clashed on the court

That’s all either of them are looking at right °

now, and why shouldn’t they? The two helped
mold the program for four years and took
Pitt7s progress a step further at each‘ season’s

end. Last year, Pitt pushed all the way to the

Sweet 16 before losing to No. 2—seeded Stan-
ford. Zellous scored the team-high 22 points
in the contest ‘

So what_are they doing differently to enter‘
- this NCAA Tournament? . ‘ '

“We always play with a lot of ﬁre and pas-

’ sion as a team,” said Stewart; “This ‘time we‘,

5

need more aggression. We’ll play anybody, as
long as we get to that championship game.”
Stewart reached 1,000 points in, her career
this season and averages 11.1 pointsiper game.
‘She is the only Panther averaging in the double
digits besides Zellous, along with an average of
four rebounds per game. She scored 14 against
DePaul in her last Big East tournament.
Though Stewart knows .as well as Zellous
that every play could be her last in a Pit jersey,
she tries not to worry about that _
‘Tm not looking at [the NCAA Tourna-

t-:sTI_t: DRAFTS

ment] as my last “one,” said Stewart. “I’m just‘

trying hard for my team. I’ll put myself sec-
on .” ,

Both Zellous and Stewart plan to ‘continue
 basketball after this season, either over-

. seas or in the WNBA, but neither wants to

worry about -that until her time at Pitt ends and ,
after tryingfor that national title. _ 0

‘‘We’ve pushed the team really far in the
past four years,” said_ Zellous “We want to
take it even further for the University of Pitts-
burg .” ' .

Fields‘ leadership key for Pitt in March

Burgos, page 25 '
the most important player on the
team.

While Fields isn’t considered
a top—ﬂight NBA prospect, col-
lege basketball is a point guard’s
game. Fields ran his team better
than anyone else in the country
this year.

He has the numbers to prove
it. His 7.6 assists per game and
3.87—to—1 assist—to—turnover ratio
both lead the Big East and are
good for second in the nation
this season, respectively. He also
has the second—highest assist total
in a single game when he doled
out 16 dimes against DePaul ear-
lier this year.

No other BCS conference
player even sniffs those numbers,
with the exception of North Car-
olina’s Ty Lawson, whose assist—
to—turnover ratio is just below
that of Fields.

It’s the senior guard’s experi-
ence that does it. A rock with the
ball, Fields is as physically strong
as any guard in college hoops and
can be a one—man press break.

Seldom do you see him lose his
handle or get pushed off the
ball.

Now, it’s true that guys like
Blair and Young are integral to
Pitt’s success. These two led the
team in scoring in all but one
game this year. Blair ruled the
glass all year and proved to be
one of the best frontcourt play-
ers in college basketball.

Young has continued what he
started last year. Quiet and under
the radar, he’s been the premier
scorer on a premier team in a pre-
mier conference.

Not as heralded as the loud
and brash Blair, Young has gone
about his business without much
ruckus. All he’s done is average
18.7 points a game, been there
for the Panthers every time when
they needed a bucket and dorni—
nated other national powers like
Connecticut with ease. No man-
to—man defense in Division 1—A
can lock down Young, and he
knows it.

But funny thing happens right

before Young catches the ball on
the wing or before Blair receives
the rock on the block: Someone
puts the ball right where it needs
to be.

Young will usually square up
and look to make a move to the
hoop. One or two dribbles in, if
it’s not there, he passes it back
to the top. If Blair can’t hit his
defender with a drop step or get
to the rim 4 admittedly not too
often — he kicks it back out for
a repost.

The Panthers look to Fields to
set the play and get them the ball
where they can be most success-
ful. And when the game is on the
line, who do you want taking the
last shot? Remember Duke at the
Garden? Of course you do.

Simply put, Fields is a gamer.
He’s Pitt’s coach on the ﬂoor, a
true general with the ball in his
hands.

When the Panthers cut down
those pearly white cotton nets in
Detroit in a couple of weeks, it’ll
be because Fields led them there.

Creighton,

Mid-‘majors, page 10

sent four schools to the Tournament in
2006, has just one representative this year.
Northern Iowa —- in with an automatic
bid — is the conference’s sole Tournament
delegate. I

Creighton missed the NCAA Tourna-
ment after a 24-point loss to Illinois State
in the Missouri Valley Conference tourna-
ment hung on the selection committee’s
minds. The Bluejays had an 11-gamewin
streak before the upset.

With the rest of the conference irn—
proving, said Welser, top teams are posting
less impressive records.

“I think there’s more parity in our
league than ever before,” said Doug Elgin,
conference commissioner.

The Davidson Wildcats began the sea-
son ranked No. 20 in the AP Top 25. A
loss to Charleston, 59-52, in the Southern
Conference tournament, though, and an
0-3 record against ranked opponents cost
them a spot in March Madness.

Injuries cost other mid—majors a Tour-
nament bid.

Saint Mary’s dropped from an 18-1, No.
22 squad to a bubble team after a costly
hand injury to guard Patrick Mills.

The Gaels dropped four of their next
ﬁve games after losing their leading scor-
er. K

Mills returned in the West Coast Con-
ference tournament but shot 2 for 16 in a
championship game loss to Gonzaga.

“There were times where I tried to baby
[the hand] a little bit,” said Mills after his
return. “But I think it is just conﬁdence
getting back into the game, knowing that
my hand is ﬁne and it is ready to go.”

“He needs practice, and we need prac-
tice,” said coach Randy Bennett after the
loss to Gonzaga.

Memphis, Xavier and Gonzaga return
to March Madness this year, though they

V are not the Cinderellas often synonymous

with “mid—major.”

No. 12 Gonzaga has made the tourna-
ment 10 straight years, No. 19 Xavier has
missed the Tournament once in the last

eight years and No. 4 Memphis played in

last year’s championship.

Butler and Brigham Young universities
are the nation’s two other ranked rnid—ma—
jors. No. 16 Butler lost to Cleveland State

‘in the Horizon League tournament ﬁnal

but returns to the Tournament with an at-
large bid. No. 25 Brigham Young lost out
on an automatic bid after San Diego State
upset it in the Mountain West tournament
semiﬁnals. D .
“You want to win your league. and

St. Mary's miss out

qualify for the NCAA Tournament,” said
Brigham Young coach Dave Rose. “It’s
one of the ﬁrst things we talk about every
year.”

Dayton and Temple join Xavier as At-
lantic 10 tournament-goers" with at—large
bids.

Temple won the Atlantic 10 tourna-
ment. Dayton makes its ﬁrst March Mad-
ness appearance since 2004.

In comparison, North Dakota State
from the Summit League makes its ﬁrst
Tournament appearance. Guard Ben
Woodside leads the former Division II
team in scoring and is 10th in the nation
with 22.8 points per game.

“It’s something that we’ve been work-
ing so hard for the last ﬁve years,” said se-
nior center Luke Moormann. “We put our
blood, sweat and tears into this.”

memorable game in Big East history.

In the last quarterﬁnal battle
Thursday night, the Orange defeated

,, Connecticut in a six—overtirne slugfest

127-117. Only one game in NCAA
history lasted longer, when Cincin-
nati beat Bradley in seven overtimes
in 1981. F
Syracusesophomore point guard
jonny Flynn played an astronomical
67 minutes in that victory and set the
Big East tournament record for most
minutes played and most assists Flynn
rode those numbers to the tourna-
ment’s Most Valuable Player award,

..a -1 the ﬁrst such honor for a member of

a losing team since Georgetowrfs Vic-
tor Page in 1996.‘

The Orange nearly won Thurs-
day’s game in regulation, as senior Eric
Devendorf hit a 3-pointer after a tip

from a i:U.l.l-COu1't pass as time expired. ,

The shot initially counted, but careﬁil
viewing on replays showed that the
ball was still on Devendorf’s ﬁngertips
when the buzzer sounded.
Devendorf found a flair for the

%%l1t”§EE2009

dramatic throughout the tournament.
In Syracuse’s first game Wednesday
against Seton Hall, Dever1dorf was
charged a technical foul for escalating
a near ﬁght in the second half. In Fri-
day’s semiﬁnal against West Virginia,
he hit a shot from beyond halfcourt
just before halftime to give the Orange
a‘seVen-point lead in a game Syracuse
would win in yet another overtime

West Virginia made it to the semi-
ﬁnals by upsetting No. 2 Pitt 74-60 on
Thursday. \X/1th strong Big East tour-
nament runs, both the Mountaineers
and the Orange  improved their
NCAA Tournament seeds by one or
tWO. ‘
Villanova entered the ﬁnal four of
the conference tournament on a buzz-
er—beater that was mostly forgotten
after the Syracuse-Connecticut thriller
Dwayne Anderson made a reverse
layup as time expired in Thursday’s
quarterﬁnal battle with Marquette to
give the Wildcats a shot at Louisville
with the 7c75 victory. ’

O Tired Syracuse can't keep rested
 Cardinals away from top spot

 showdown between titans Pitt
and Connecticut, but both fell unex-
pectedly in the quarterﬁnals

For a while, it seemed as if the
favorites would dominate the com-
petition From Tuesday night through
Thursday afternoon, eight straight
higher seeds advanced to the next
round until West Virginia took down
the Panthers

The most surprising upset of the
tournament came in the very ﬁrst
contest on Tuesday DePaul, which
went (L18 in regular-season confer-
ence play, beat No. 9-seed Cincinnati
The Blue Demons then gave Provi-
dence a tough game on Wednesday
before falling to the Friars. J

The domino effect hurt Provi-
dence, which needed one more major
win to make the NCAA Tournament;
Had the Friars beat Cincinnati in the
second round, that might have done
the trick. But the win over DePaul
wasn’t enough, and Providence’s loss
to Louisville in the quarterﬁnals sealed
its fate as an NIT team.
