. The Student Government Board
(SGB) is still missing one member
as SGB members continue to
interview candidates for the posi-
tion. . _

The Board slot has been vacant
since Sue Turner's resignation
shortly after her inauguration early

, i ast month.

SGB President Barry Weisband
said the last round of interviews on
Wednesday were cancelled be-
cause two Board members were
absent. ,

Board members Larry Gleason
and Chip Hubbard were unable to
attend the interviews.

The announcement of the ap-
pointment. which was to be made
at last night’s meeting‘, will be
delayed until next week, Weisband
said. - —

Of Too Much Rhetoric

BY DEANNA CONGILEO
AND LISA RUBENSTEIN

The Student Coalition Against
Tuition Hikes (SCATH) should be
less -rhetorical in its efforts to
mobilize the student body, Student
Government Board (SGB) Presi-
dent Barry Weisband said last

- night.

The SGB is interested primarily
in helping SCATH become more
educationally oriented, Weisband
said.

SGB member Robin Wertkin said
the coalition is functioning on’ a
rhetorical basis and should concen-
trate on educating the mass of
students who may be ignorant of an
impending tuition increase.

“We believe 50% of Pitt
students do not understand’

"Fired" Prof Chorge$PoIitics

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Members of Pitt's sociology
department are coming under
attack because they cancelled an
assistant professor’s contract al-

.legedly for nonacademic reasons.

Dr; Paul Nyden was informed by
sociology chairman Dr. Burkart
Holzner on Tuesday that the
department's steering committee
had reviewed his academic and
scholarly work and recommended
in a confidential report his
appointment not be renewed.

“I was not permitted to know the
specifics of the charges,” Nyden
said of the report. “I believe there
are political reasons for the
recommendation.”

According to Nyden, his doctoral
dissertation about the struggles of
coal miners was reviewed by a
committee at Columbia University
and had resulted in a Ph.D.
awarded with distinction. He
pointed out his work had been
reviewed last year by a departmen-
tal committee and that this new
report amounted to academic
“double jeop rdy.”

earlier this week. This policeman undoubtedly is wondering from '

Holzner said the review was a
routine assessment taken at the

‘midpoint of a faculty member-’s

contract with any University
department.

“I can’t release the details of the I

report because it’s .University
policy to withhold it until after.
Dean Jerome Rosenberg of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences has
reviewed it,” Holzner said.

“The charges by some ‘groups
that Dr.‘ Nyden has been ‘ﬁred’
totally inaccurate,’ ’ Holzner added.
“The review of any faculty member
has, to go through an appointed
committee, the steering committee
of the department, the meeting of
senior faculty, and ultimately Dean
Rosenberg, who. makes the ﬁnal
decision.”

Holzner said Nyden would not be
fired and the recommendation
centers on whether the sociology

~department should offer ~Nyden

another three-year contract.
Nyden’s current appointment ex-
pires in April, 1977.

Details of the report will be
shown to Nyden. when Rosenberg

- has made his review, Holzner said.

The chairman said political consid-
erations had not inﬂuenced the
department's
Nyden’s work.

Pitt hasn't been a good
neighbor to the many residents
who share Oakland with the
University, but the spirit of
cooperation voiced by Vice Chan-
cellor for Public Affairs Bernard
Kobosky could be effective, Oak-

chairwoman Lois Devereau be-
lieves.

faculty to express their [opinions
and ideas,” Holzner said.
“However, it is also a university’s
‘duty to protect academic excelence.
This entire subject is more
complicated than simple slogans
would indicate.” ~

Allegations about the political
nature of the committee’s recom-
mendation were caused‘partly by a-
campaign being‘ waged against.
Nyden by an ultraconservative‘
commentator on WEEP radio. ’ The
commentator, Roger Willoughby
Ray, who is also program director
of the station, has claimed Nyden
has communist leanings. '

Ray also reportedly has declared
Pitt’s. sociology and journalism
departments are riddled with
communists.

(Pitt does not have a journalism
department.)

Ray reportedly has urged such
reforms as‘ the
welfare recipients’ voting privil-
eges and the selection of classroom
textbooks by taxpayers.

A movement is «underway by
students to have the committee’s
decision revoked and Nyden’s
contract renewed. This group
already has distributed a number of _
posters around campus and is
holding a meeting in G-4 Mervis
Hall today at noon.

lack ‘of parking, policing and
cleanliness.

She advocates cooperation be-
tween residents, the University,
hospitals and businessmen. “I
really do believe we can work
things" out, but there has to
cooperation. If we had a business
community that worked with us, we
would have much more success.”
ODI, she claimed, is largely
responsible for forcing -Pitt ,to
acknowledge the presence of the

 

revocation of _

SCATH’s function,” Weisband.  
said. The SGB wants to educate‘ 

students about SCATH’s theory
and philosophy, he~explain_ed, so

‘ that students can develop a better
strategy aimed at alleviating or 

minimizing any hike in tuition.

“SGB should get together with -
SCATH about our budget concerns
and take up Mr. Dutton’s, (Vice
Chancellor for Business and
Finance) offer to go over the
budget,” Weisband said.

Board members will attend all
SCATH committee meetings and
functions, Weisband said. .

“We owe SCATH more than an

endorsement of strong support,” ’
~ _he said. “We can’t complain about V
SCATH’s direction until we are ‘ 

ready to become directly involved
in inﬂuencing SCATH’s activi-
ties.” ’ ’

SCATH spokesmen . said ,,a

petition against tuition hikes has -

been signed by more than.'2,000
students and is still circulating.

Speakers for the scheduled W

Provost's Area Vote Unsettled .  

(Continued from Page 1)

«to sway the ﬁnal tally by the State
Labor Board.

A hearing between‘ the parties
involved will be held next week to
make a determination of how many

"of the 64 contested ballots actually
will count in the ﬁnal tally.

Since no ballot option in the
Provost’s area received a simple
majority (50% plus one vote), there
‘will be a runoff between the “No
Representative” option and the
-PPU if rulings on contested ballots

do not affect the PPU’s' standing. _

The showing by the PPU, which

pulled 21% of the total vote in the -

‘Provost’s area, was attributed to a
-‘last-minute drive by the organiza-
tion’s president, Van Beck Hall.
“Our strength “ was in the
regional campuses, I think,” Hall
the counts were
announced. “The stuff we sent out
in the end had a lot to do with the
ﬁnal vote.’’ ’ A
Discounting any drastic effect
from the 64 challenged votes, Hall
said the PPU would begin talks
with the other unions ‘to form a

coalition to face “No Representa--

tive” in a runoff.

“We’ll talk about ‘a combined
on the part of the
unions———not a merger but _a
bargaining caucus organized with

each union keeping its own
structure.”

Seth Spaulding, president of the
AAUP’, noted the PPU margin was
relatively slim but was due in the
“good, solid campaign” that
marked the PPU drive. ‘

On the possibility of joining with
the PPU to win over “No
Representative,” Spaulding said it
would have to wait for a meeting
between ‘the unions. Because of a

, unanimous vote by the AAUP

membership to stop a proposed
merger »last summer, Spaulding
said the chances for a combination
now seem slim. -

“As an organization, I can’t see
how we would combine,” he‘said,
“but of course what the [member-_
ship does is another story. It will
have to wait for our meeting. I’m
through making predictions.”

An ofﬁcial comment from the
Chancellor’s Ofﬁce noted a plural-
ity in the Provost’s area voted “No
Representative” and that two
schools (Law and Health) voted
down a union. 1

“It is hoped now that the options
are narrowed, the continuing
debate will be constructive and
pave the -way for a reasoned
decision on the issue of faculty
unionization in the undecided area
of‘ the University,” the statement
read. .

PSEA President Don McBurney

said the PPU will receive’ 100%
support from the PSEA and that

the PSEA would continue to work *

on campus.

“The results surprised every-
body," McBurney said, “but as to
whether the PSEA will actually join
as an organization, well, it’s too
early to tell.” _ .

He added the PSEA would be
making a public statement on
reactions to the election and future
plans. ‘

In the Medical School, of 352
ballots cast, the Faculty Associa-
tion of the Medical School took 218

votes, followed by “No Represen- ,

tative” with 111 and the PSEA with
22. The challenged votes in the
Medical School numbered 30,
which unlike the 64 in the Provost’s
area were not sufficient to make a
difference in the ﬁnal tally, so they
were excluded. -

In the’ Graduate Schools’ of
Health, of 214 total ballots, “No
Representative” took 122; the
AAUP, 61 and the PSEA, 31.
Nineteen challenged votes were not
considered because the number
would be too small to effect the
outcome of the election.

In the Law School, of 20 votes,
“No Representative” took 12 and
the Pitt LawjFaculty Association
took eight. There were no
challenges.

"70 years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”
. OfO _ 2
 Where the Sacn Ice.

No one today feels conﬁdent enough to speak of the University
budget with any degree of optimism. Appropriations from Harrisburg
don’t look promising, and students, under the auspices of the Student
Coalition Against Tuition Hikes (SCATH), and administrators are
rmpping strategies to deal with a state austerity budget. ' _

; Chancellor ‘Wesley Posvar said Tuesday that there will be an
‘ “allocation of sacriﬁce to everyone” to minimize a tuition hike. - ’
That the Chancellor realizes that raising tuition should not be the

, sole approach to alleviating a ﬁnancial crunch is a little heartening to

those expecting a hike. .
Ifthe state proves unresponsive to Pitt’s needs, the difference must
~ be made up by a combination of measures, as Posvarsuggests, and not

i . by a mammoth boost in tuition. ‘

Should matters progress to this stage, careful decisions must be

. . « made about where the sacriﬁces should be made.

» The administration must see to it that no cuts are made in the areas
of black studies and women’s studies, two of the more recent additions
to the Pitt curriculum. Because the programs have no tradition at this
 is no reason to cut funds from their budgets, especially since
Pitt has maintained its image as an urban university.

Women and minorities will have many opportunities to face the ‘ ‘last

,, hired-ﬁrst ﬁred”_ philosophy as soon as they encounter the job market.

We hope the University does not see ﬁt to give them a primer course in
it regarding study programs. ' ‘

Coordinated Energy

Through all the usual election-year hoopla, it's generally taken for A

gra.nt_ed that those on the receiving end of campaign rhetoric already‘
are registered to vote. ‘ ‘ g

P Pitt’s College Young Democrats-(CYD) and College Republicans
(CR), however, didn't take it for granted, and on Wednesday and

' ,0 Thursday sponsored a voter registration drive to afford more students

an opportunity to cast ballots in_ next month’s primary and in

‘ November’s general election.

' Though registering voters at booths in the Towers main lobby and
the Student Union art gallery wasn't one of the more exciting activities
on campus the past two days, it was nevertheless well-attended.

What for some students was just a formality became for others
an implementation of the right that is the very crux of democracy.

An awareness of such rights is the basis for most, if not all, CYD_ and
CR projects. Their most recent success was Meet-the-Candidates Day,
which coincided with last November’s City and County elections.

While some marvel at the fact that student branches of ‘America’s'

two major political parties can coexist peacefully in the same office
, when their candidates areout attacking each other’s party ideology,
those familiar with their joint projects are aware of the high-spirited
cooperation the student Democrats and Republicans lend each other.
Although an occasional slip of the party tongue will spark quick, hot
debate, members of CYD and CR realize that the only way they can
serve Pitt students is if they pool their energies.

What's a campus bus?
Jud Hilliard sits in his bus

‘ outside Benedum Hall all right and

ﬁnishes his lunch, then smokes a
big cig, then takes a 20-minute
break, then slowly shifts his gears
. and the big blue bus rolls along

, finally. Surely a better system can

be developed than the one in
operation. For students going to
Trees Hall or any other University
building in that vicinity, you must
ﬁrst set aside an extra hour in your
plans to get‘ to a class or
appointment on time‘.

Not only does Mr. Jud take his
supposedly allotted breaks during
prime time, i.e.. 1 to 1:30 p.m., 3 to
3:30 p.m., but he always lets
non-University kids on the bus,
leaving Pitt students standing in
the aisles and even sometimes

unable to get on the bus at all.
Nowhere in the University rules
have 1 seen this as a characteristic
or purpose of the campus bus! Who
is this service for? University
people or just anyone ‘who needs‘ a
lift up the hill and back?

Hilliard max‘ be 5 fr

    
   

warmth or consideration from him
or for him in my four years at this
University. And I have been using

the campus bus consistently in the
past when it is working and ifl can
get on it.

lf Jud Hilliard is doing his job as
J.W. Schmidtt Inc. has told him,
then l suggest the University look
into other busing contractors
because this particular charter just
“ain't suitin‘ our needs."

Dissection of a Town

BY TOM WASELESKI

There is something about going
homethat is like exploring a musty
attic. -

You become more aware of
telegraph wires and their chipping,
splintery ‘brown poles. The.black
lines seem to hover over sidewalks
and sidewalkers like’ someon_e’s
dirty clotheslines. Blackbirds hop
on the wires like rats in an airborne
garbage dump.

The hemlines are shockingly
short, the legs bowed or s_hapeless-
ly bland, the knees knobby. Men’s
bellies are mass~ive—their plain
black belts cut into spongy guts and
cause distinct overhangs.

There is a different smell about

'things—-—a smell that says people
don't just work here; they live here,
too. Cheap peanuts and chocolate
in the open air at Vﬁve-and-
tens. The sweet, mellow aroma of a
blue-yellow slick of motor oil on the
street or the tartscolcgne of some

splashed gasoline. The dominant’

smell of the air is so neutral that

Traditionally, the-Shamrock ball
has been the pinnacle of the six-day

series of activities during Engi- '

neers’ Week. In fact, the success or
failure of Engineers’ Week largely
depends upon this festivity alone.
One might expect then that
preparation for such an important
event would begin many months in
advance. Being‘ cognizant of this

and the fact that the success of the '

ball was largely contingent upon
funding, the Engineering Student
Cabinet submitted its allocations
request in February, 1975, almost
13 months ago. Much to the
consternation of the Cabinet,.the
SGB just recently made their ﬁnal
decision regarding our request.

What warrants such procrastina-

tion on behalf of the SGB? Indeed,
the decision appeared. to be, the
‘product of precipitation, rather
than deliberation! I

The goal of the Engineering
Student Cabinet’s efforts was to
have a budget modiﬁcation ap-
proved by the Allocations Commit-
tee. This modification would
authorize the shifting of $700 from’

subtle as a passing dress box or the
tires on someone’s new car.

JIMPRESSIONS

The conversation centers on gas
bills, layoffs, the new apartment
high-rise (10 stories), a bargain on
sugar, someone who has a lump on
her neck, -new brakes, onion bulbs,
"how late a high-school senior
should be allowed to stay out (as
opposed to a high-school junior),
what’s his name’s funeral and
whose wife is pregnant. _ M

Old buildings bearthe datesof
their construction, and there is an
element of wonder in the fact
they’ve stood unassumingly

throughxso many years‘ of shut-J

downs and callbacks. Edsels and
Oswalds, bobby socks and bell-
bottoms. They stand out of the
way, much like the old folks who
seem to be quietly, though
constantly, everywhere." 3
The small-store proprietors come
and go, penny candy becomes

one area of the budget to the
Shamrock Ball. There was no
request made for additional fund-
ing.

The main reason the Alloca-
tions Committee gave for rejecting
the modification request was that
they wished not to break an estab-
lished “precedent” of refusing to
fund formal dances ‘of individual
organizations. importantly, how-
ever, the organization involved is
the School of Engineering, not a
separate social group. Inaddition,
the Shamrock Ball was the only
formal open to all students in the

University, with over 25% of the

tickets purchased by nonengineers!
An equally ludicrous rationale
would be the federal government
not funding intrastate _ highways
because they are used primarily by
people ina particular state.

Representatives "from the Engi-
neering Student Cabinet had the
experience of recently meeting
with the new. SGB on two occa-
sions. The Allocations Commit-tee's
recommendation to not approve the
request of the ESC was defeated at
the first session by a .one-vote
margin, with one abstention. One
objection of the SGB, however, was
that resident students would not
have transportation to the ball,
since it was being held off campus.
In an attempt to appease the
Board, the ESC embarked in a
lucubration to determine if trans-
portation was. in fact. an obstacle.

It was revealed at the second

meeting of the SGB that more-,
than-adeq/uate transportation was

    Ethnic Clubs’ Popularity Growing At Pitt

BY BOB MAYO

The young men and W0m€I1
stood wagging their index ﬁngers
at each other in rebuke. First they
waved right hands, then the lefts.

They circled each other. Suddenly

 the men formed a ring around the

women. Then the music began.

What they are doing is ethnic
dancing—Italian in this case. To

March--12,1976 .

   

the surprise of some, it is not that
unusual an event at Pitt.

There are more than a dozen
nationality and foreign-student
organizations associated with the
University. They are the source of
many activities, and some appear
to be doing fairly well.

ment recognition just last year.

“We always have a coffee house
Tuesday evenings,” club President
Patricia Connelly said. “We serve
refreshments and play contempor-
ary Italian music along with Italian
folk music.”

But the activities are not limited
to eating and dancing. Visitors to
the cafes held in the Graduate
School of Public Health Building
have the opportunity to watch and
learn folk dancing.

Jesse Polito, a performer from
the Italian dance troupe “I.
Campagnoli,” visits the club
regularly to teach and entertain.

“We do have what we’re calling
associate members,” Connelly
said. “They’re people from the
local community who can offer
something to us,” she noted.

Arte e Cultura has still bigger
things in mind. The club plans a
trip to Toronto next weekend.

“They have an area with pfople
of Italian descent /who’ve kept the
culture intact,” Connelly said.
“What they’ve done is rebuild Italy
there. We hope to get a group of 40
and rent a bus to go up.”

The major reason for student
interest, according to Connelly, is
an .awareness of background that
comes after studying the language
in school.

Sophomore Margie Matus re-
cently was appointed head of the
new ‘Slovak-Czech‘ Club. She
related a different experience that
heightened her interest in ethnic
affairs.

“When‘I was in%‘_,é3high'school, we; ,
were assigned to research’ our '

family background and our heri-
tage,” she said. “I could only ﬁnd
one book with anything at all about
Slovaks other than a‘ sentence or
two. It was a paragraph of mostly
derogatory remarks.

' “It talked about our.‘_l_;gad temper

and weak will for booze’—,some-
thing to the effect that our ide‘a»of a
good time is to see how many
empty beer kegs we could leave
rolling on the ground. That was in

the high-school library.” -

Matus refused to give the report
to the class, but since then has
developed a greater concern for
promoting interest in Slovak
culture. She hopes the new club
will be active in the fall.

One nationality group hasbeen
active at Pitt for years—the
American Irish Society.

“We like to get together‘ and
discuss different social and cultural
aspects of Ireland,” explained club

at

President Dorolyn Smith. The
society meets twice a month on
Wednesdays.

“We also have coffee houses
once a term,” Smith said. “We'd
like to have them more, but there’s
quite a bit of planning and it's
rough to find musicians and a room
that’s available.

Nearly 175 people attended the
coffee house last term, Smith said.
Some members prepared Irish soda
bread and Irish coffee for the affair.

“We’ve also had a tin whistle
player, Smith said. “He’s in
Chicago now studying bagpipe.
We're trying to get something
together for the end of March.

Beginning Monday, the Gaelic
Arts Society, the Irish-American
Cultural Institute and the General
Studies Student Cabinet will
present Irish Fortnight, a week of
lectures and socials on Irish
culture. .

Not all members of the ethnic
clubs are “natural-born” mem-
bers. '

“I'm not of Irish descent at all,”
said Smith, who is part English,
part Danish and part German. “I
just happen to like Irish culture and
Irish music.”

Apparently that’s not all she
likes. She also is a representative
of the International Folk Dance
Club, an organization of people
from many backgrounds. The
group meets Sunday evenings at
the University and City Ministries
Building. .

Dances from Bulgaria, Turkey,

Eastern Eu_rope_and Israel are

among those taught to the more
then 30 students who visit‘each
week.

“We're not a performing
group,” Smith said. “We’re a
dancing-for—pleasure group.

“I think this ‘is primarily a
Pittsburgh phenomenon. It’s part
of an ethnic movement that’s going
around the country, but it's more
concentrated in Pittsburgh.’.’

Evidence of that concentration
abounds. There is also a German
Club that has sponsored films and
an Oktoberfest celebration. It will
stage a play next month. The local
Hillel has an Israeli Folk Dance
Troupe. ' The Pitt International
Student Organization has a cultural
show every three months. It
highlights fashions from Europe,
Asia, Africa and America.

There are Formosan, Egyptian,
Japanese, Chinese, Israeli, Arab»
and Nigerian organizations for
exchange students.

But for the grandchildren of
those who came to this country
years ago, there is one reason for
the‘ interest in ethnic heritage.
Matus pinpointed it.

“Theheritage is slowly being
lost,” she said. “The older people
are dying off, and some of the
younger people’ don’t. take an
interest in it.

There's a lot that’s starting to
develop, but if- they don’t start
generating these things now, it will
be lost." .

They didn’t make the tryouts for A Chorus Line, but they practice

every week for the Italian Club.

OLD STUDENTS NEVER DIE...

MANSFIELD, Ohio AP-
Charles H. Wagner of Shelby is
back in college at the age of 93,
because “it’s a good way to spend
my time."

“Why, just think of the
d_ifference between what’s known
in chemistry alone” from when he
graduated from St. Lawrence

(/"ﬁg/lniversity in upstate New York 72

years ago, Wagner said.

He is taking a course on the
American presidency at the local
Ohio State University extension
campus. he recently completed
study in cultural and physical

anthropology, physical geography,

descriptive astronomy and the
economic and industrial geography
of Ohio.

“I’ve always been interested in

keeping up with what's going on in
the world,” Wagner said.

RAPE L’AW REVISED

,/.&\,,,.CHARLESTON, W. Va. (AP)—
'  bill changing the state’s harsh

penalty rape law to a sexual assault
statute with varying penalties
awaits action by the governor.

The bill was sent to Gov. Arch A.
Moore Jr. on Thursday after the
House voted 87-2 to accept a
Senate change in the bill.

The measure, part of a feminist
backed revision in sex related laws,
changes rape from a crime with a
mandatory life sentence penalty to
three degrees of sexual assault
with a maximum penalty of a 10 to
20 year sentence and a $10,000

NO WAY TO TREAT A LADY

SAN DIEGO AP—A young
man tried to present a skinned
goat’s head to Betty Ford when the
First Lady was in San Diego, Secret
Service agents said Thursday.

Agents said they questioned
Boyd Blake Rice, 19, and released
him. Rice said he was a follower of
Dadaism, an art movement of the
early 1920s, but gave no other
reason for his actions, they said.

Supervising agent Chester Miller
said Rice was spotted in the crowd
as Mrs. Ford visited a senior
citizens’ center Wednesday. “At
that time the goat’s head was
mounted on a placard the young
man was carrying,” he said.

“It was bloody. The eyeballs
were still in the sockets, and the
tongue was hanging out,” Miller
said.

“Thc only reason we stopped
him is because he took the head off
and looked like he was approaching
hcr. That's not the kind of thing
you should present a lady.”

Heinz Hall Performance

Mirageof Reality by ‘Maestro’ of Illusion

BY MREA CSORBA

Words pale in light of Marcel
Marceau’s silent performance
"Wednesday night. If words could
approach the impact of pantomime,

 Marceau could have been saved a

lot of skipping, climbing and
tugging across stage and remained
/at his old-man’s park bench to tell
his “Remembrance” story. As it
was, the Heinz Hall audience was
transported through time with that
old man for a firsthand experience.

. of his youth.

For this review, a friend
suggested a series of pantomimed
photographs projecting the audien-
ces’ reaction to Marceau’s crea-
tions. That would be in tune with
the subject, but I think our ability
for pantomime would turn into_ a
gross caricature of splendid per-
formance. ‘

Someone may tell you Marceau
incorporated a tremendously con-
vincing act with three sets of hands
in “Pickpocketer’s Nightmare.”
Ridiculous!

Marceau owned six hands in

‘ ‘ Pickpocketer’ s Nightmare, ’ ’ and
that’s all there is to it.
Furthermore those arms, like

telescope barrels, can be lenghten-
ed or shortened at will. They.
stretch, appearing on both sides of
two six-foot screens, snatching up
treasures. When they reappear at
the pickpocketer’s side, they are
normal size once more.

 

Things get complicated when the
numerous hands start playing
catch-me-if-you-can with their
owner. Heedless to commands,
they ﬂit across the tops of the
screens and down the sides. They
join the Pickpocketer only when
they want to.

Through Marceau’s favorite
character, Bip, Don Juan is raised
to life again, giving us the full story
of his “adventures.” What does

Don Juan do after a heavy day of

  
  

' Marcel Marceau portraying his
famous Bip character in his mime

jilted lovers? He goes home to a
wife he has to stand on his toes to
kiss and submissively starts the
wash-the-dishes-take-out-the- ‘
garbage-and-the-dog routine.

Many Marceau/Bip skits c_apture
perfectly the “showman” phen-
omenon. The Bip that goes ice
skating is all pokes and jeers and
“Ha, Ha’s” over the downfalls of

Rather the casual absent-minded

dextrous movements, secretly
grasping the side-rail.

“Bip as Lion Tamer” continues
the “show must go on” attitude on
more dangerous territory. Pres-
enting a wide-grin face to the circus

ing side shots at the stubborn lio’n,
Bip does not succeed in putting on

I entered the Oliver Plaza Dinner -

Theater 2 in La Bastille Restaurant
on Friday night and I waited. “Sit
over there,” the waitress barked.
So I sat. But then I was asked to
move; I had taken the seat reserved
for The Press. With a definite air
of indignation I moved.

Iwas now sitting in some remote
corner of the “theater.” This
theater is in a small room with a
very small stage. A small stage
with four microphones. The actors
could have had laryngitis and they
still would have been heard from
the far corner of the room.

On this stage were some colored
blocks and a backdrop. If this
backdrop was to look like a comic
strip, it also looked like the edition
of the paper which was used to line
the garbage can last week.

The lights dimmed as I whisper-

becomes light itself. Marceau
melts into Adam, then becomes
God, who in a powerful, heavy
moment wrestles a rib from Adam.
Then he turns into Eve, his ﬂuid
hands expressing the tempting
snake around her. The story is

_ complete with the shameful exodus

from the garden.

This scene breaks the silence of
the show. Marceau’s movements
are slow and powerful and are aptly

ed to myself, “Boy, the acting had
better be dynamite.”

“Wrong.”

The acting was mediocre to poor,
with the exception of one person.
Tom Spinella in the role of Snoopy,
played. By. this I mean that he
enjoyed being on stage and even if
he didn’t, he looked like it.

However, neither he nor the
other actors were helped at all by
the banal choreography (by Pat
» Cohen) and direction (by Pat

Kording).

To cite an example of the lack of
empathy that the staff had with the
show, I will simply say that Lucille
Van Pelt, that same Lucy we all
know and love, walked out in the
first act in a powder" blue satin
dress. My ten-year old sister
knows more about Lucy than
designer Don DiFonso.

Which brings up another point.

accompanied by loud, windy music.

Everyone in the audience was,
I’m sure, waiting for individual‘-.
favorites from the Marceau reper-
toire. No, Marceau did not get
squeezed into a shrinking cage.
And the breeze must have been
low, for he did not walk against the
wind. He did do perhaps the most
demanding act—“The Mask-
maker.”

It involved a rhythmical interplay
of posing various masks, adapting
body postures to each switch. The

'Maskr'naker settles into an inter-

change of a jolly mask and a sad
one. The Maskmaker’s own face
becomes the third part of the act.

Marceau steps up the tempo, and
the "alternations evolve into a
twitching, contorting dance.

His merging of
characters approaches an actual
transformation. . The old man’s
“Remembrances” ﬂowed imper-
ceptively between the melodic
movement of youth and the stiff
jerkiness of old age.

The only unconvincing portrayal
was in ~“David and Goliath.”
Marceau does not have the height
to successfully contrast the two.
Though the stature of each was put
forth well, Goliath was a conspic-
uously short giant. I

Charged misleading

Grant Program Under Fire  

BY RICH HARRY

Misleading information on the
Basic Educational Opportunity
Grants (BEOG) program applica-
tions for the coming academic year
mayeffect some of the estimated
1,800 Pitt students receiving those
grants.

The National Student Lobby
(NSL) has charged the U.S. Office
of Education with providing the
misleading information.

The BEOG applications state: “It
is estimated that during the
1976-1977 academic year the
awards will range between $50 and

1/751,000." However, according to

congressional legislation authoriz-
ing the program, students are
eligible for a maximum $1,400
grant.

said the $1,000 maximum ﬁgure
was used in the application because
Congress has not appropriated
enough funds to offer full-size
grants to students.

Appropriations are based on
Office of Education predictions of
the number of eligible students
applying l_ for grants.‘ The office
miscalculated this year’s estimate,
predicting only 56% of students
would be eligible. However, at last

/‘count, 74% are eligible.

A spokesman for the Office -of
Education basic grants division’

bill that would provide additional
funds to the BEOG program for the
coming school year. An estimated
$600 million is needed to offer
maximum grants of $1,400 to
eligible students.

According to Steve Pressman‘,
co-director of the NSL, the Office of
Education should provide students
with complete and non-misleading
information about the financial aid
picture.

“The BEOG application should
have made reference to the
pending congressional action,
which could restore the $1,400
grants,” he said. .

The BEOG spokesman indicated
no plans have been discussed for
explaining the situation to stu-

dents, ﬁnancial aid officers or
anyone else, but said the Office of

_Education expects a number of‘

inquiries about grant reduction.

“You can bet there are going to
be some inquiries—perhaps from
some attorneys as well,” Pressman
said. ‘‘It appears a lot of students
are going to suffer‘ because of the
office's miscalculations.

‘‘‘I can see -why they would be
reluctant to explain that in the
applicationfor this year.”

The NSL also has announced a
nationwide lobbying effort that will
encourage ‘students to contact
Congressmen and urge their
support for the student aid funds.

Today could be the dawning of a
new era in Pitt wrestling.

The NCAA Championships begin
‘today and willlast through Sunday,
and the young Panther squad is
sending ﬁve-count ’em, ﬁve-
wrestlers to the prestigious event.

‘Kevin Nellis (118-pound‘ class),
Rande Stottlemyer (134), Bob
Bailey (142),- George‘ O’Korn (167)
and Bill Bailey (190) make up the

_ list. of championship hopefuls who

will try to improve on Pitt’s 19th
national ranking. '

Of the ﬁve Panthers who will vie
for a national crown along with 22
other wrestlers from the Eastern
Wrestling League (EWL), only one
is a senior—Bob Bailey.

. Bailey, who owned a personal
14-5 dual meet record, is going to
the NCAAs for his ﬁrst time, after
waiting in the shadows of Nellis
and assistant coach George Bryant.

_ Stottlemyer is the only experien-
iced wrestler going——he is a
two-time All-American from
Sharpsville, Pa., and has visited

.    ' Five Cat Grapfplers
 In Tucson Tournament

the NCAAs twice before. ._This
season he posted a personal 14-1-1
record, even though he missed the
last couple of weeks of the season
because of a back injury. ’

Nellis, Bill Bailey and O’Korn
are sophomores this year. Nellis,
an All-American hopeful before the
season began, earned _a 16-6
record, while O’Korn ﬁnished at
13-8 and Bill Bailey ended with an
impressive 20-1.

Bill Bailey and Stottlemyer
ﬁnished ﬁrst in their weight classes
in the EWL qualifying tournament,
O’Korn took second and Bob Bailey
and ‘Nellis captured wildcard bids

from ya ‘ﬁeld of 60 talented
wrestlers. ‘

Looking at the ﬁve-man list and
the rest of the Pitt roster, you can
see how young this Panther squad
is. With a great 12-4 record
already this year, rays of hope for
the future seem to be engulﬁng Pitt
and head coach Dave Adams. With
goodcoaching, aggressiveness and
young talent, Pitt wrestling will be
around for a long time.

“They mentioned they didn’t
want to play in the tourney,”' he
said, “because they ,didn’t want to

face the Pitt team after what‘

happened last‘ week. I never told a
player to ‘go out and get that guy,’
but when someone hits you across

the face with a stick, you've got to
retaliate.”

Barcalow is referring to one of
the four major skirmishes that took
place in the ﬁnal ﬁve minutes

of Sunday’s 8-2 Pitt win. C-MU’s

goalie slugged Panther defense-
man Russ Stump with his goalie
stick (a ‘rough equivalent of a
two-by-four), so the rugged back-
liner pummeled the Tartan net-
minder with a series of punches
despite feeling the affects of a
slight concussion. .

“They call this ‘thug hockey’,”
Barcalow said, “That’s what you

see in the World Hockey Associa- A

tion and sometimes in the National

Hockey League. I’m glad the thing I

is over though, but I told the club
not to schedule that Carnegie gang
because of what happened last year
with Charlie Hagins (former Pitt
captain) and Dave Cornelius.”
Hagins and Cornelius engaged in

one of the most heated ﬁghts ever -

at the Civic Arena when the C-MU
player supposedly spat on Hagins,
who didn’t let his opponent skate
away until he had repeatedly
banged Cornelius’ head against the
ice.
But Barcalow says these dis-
tasteful events will not happen
again for the,Panther_s are going to
be careful with.their scheduling.
“We’re going to stick with those
teams from New York and with the

In First Round of EAIAW

  Cheney Tops Pitt,

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The old baseball phrase
“Three strikes and you're out”
holds true in basketball, too. Take
the case of .the Pitt Panther-ettes;
who struck out in their third bout
with ‘Cheyney State College’. :They
went 62-50, at ‘the Field House
yesterday in the opening round of
the Eastern Association for Inter-

collegiate Athletics for Women"

(EAIAW) Basketball Regionals., ‘
Despite sloppy passing by the
Pantherettes, the early ‘going was
close, due to a strong performance
"by forward Barb Welsh. Certainly,
things looked a lot more positive

  Royals Get “Straight ms"  

BY YAIER LEHRER

It happens every year. The
experts always pick someone to
unseat the Oakland A’s from their
perpetual reign over the American
League (A.L.) West, and every
year, those A’s come back and win
the divisional crown. ' .

This year many experts are
banking on the Kansas City Royals
to topple the mighty A’s and for
once those experts might be right. '
KANSAS CITY: Speed and power
is the name of the game in Kansas
City. Fred Patek and Amos Otis’
swiped 71 bases together last
season, and the acquisition of the
speedy Dave Nelson should provide
loads of fun on the basepaths for
the Royals and a sore arm for many
A.L. catchers.

To go along with that speed, the
Royals have John Mayberry, ‘Tony

_Solaita, Hal McRae and-George

Brett tohhandle the hitting chores.
‘There are ﬁve good starting
pitchers on the Royals’ roster,
compared to two, possibly three,
for the incumbent A’s. Steve
Busby and Paul Splittorff lead a
staff ‘that includes Al Fitzmorris,
Dennis Leonard and Doug Bird.
Defense is another Royal strong
point. The inﬁeld is virtually
flawless, and Otis and Al Cowens
make up for the inadequacies of left
ﬁelder McCrae. ,1
It looks to be a great year for the
Royals. ‘ - F

than theyhad in the earlierggames
with Cheyney, with the ‘Wolves
holding a slim 29-27 lead at the
half. .
But behind the hot shooting of
5-11 center Stacey. Rhoades (20
points), Cheyney used the second
half to blow the game wide open.

Rhoades, the game’s top scorer,
was also the leader in rebounds,
with 17.
added 14 points for_ the Wolves.

Welsh, the only Pantherette to
hit double ﬁgures, was high scorer
for Pitt with 17* points. Debbie
Jones led.Pitt in rebounds, with
10.

Immaculata kicked. off yester-

among starting pitchers could hurt
them severely. Ken Holtzman,
Vida Blue and Dick Bosman head
the staff, while veteran Stan
Bahnsen plugs up the fourth spot.

With that lineup, the A’s were
forced to go to their bullpen early
and frequently last season.
Whether they can get away with it
again is questionable, although
their bullpen is the best there is.

When it comes to hitting, the
A’s are something else. They
ﬁnished second in home runs last
seasondue to the efforts of A_L,
home run king Reggie Jackson,
Gene Tenace. Joe Rudi and
designated hitter Billy‘Williams.

Rill North. Claudell.Wa::hington

and Bert Campaneris provide
speed for the A’s. Last season they
helped Oakland ﬁnish second in
base thefts.
MINNESOTA:' The Twins have
tale“t‘“° doubt about it—but
ti}6_I'e_ S just-not enough to win a
divisional title.

The Twins have Rod Carew, the
perpetual batting title winner, who
along with Larry Hisle, Steve
Braun and Dan Ford will try to give
the Twins some offense. while
Tony Oliva will attempt to give the
Twins one more year.

In the pitching department,
Minnesota has the best curveball,__-

‘pitchers Dave Goltz and .. Jim

Despite the cancellation of the
tournament, Pitt has managed to
schedule Penn State for a 2 p.m.
contest Sunday at the Arena. The
Nittany Lions were one of the
teams (West Chester the other) set
to appear in what was to be the
second annual Rotary event.

services of top goal scorer Rick
Vernon. The Panther captain has
scored 22 goals -despite seeing
limited action and Barcalow is
looking for him to help Pitt get
victory.

“We’ll have a good game with
Penn state,” Barcalow said.
“We're still smarting from the last
time, (the Panthers blew a 3-2 lead
with minutes remaining), so I think
we’re going to_ score some goals on
Sundayf’

With an 8-7-1 record Pitt is
hoping for a win over Penn State to
ﬁnish the season with a winning
recording. The Panthers are
averaging over six goals a game,
but have allowed ﬁve a game—the
mark of an offensive-minded team.

Melton, and Frank Tanana and
Nolan Ryan should team up to
strike out more batters than any
left-right combination in the game
of base_ball—that is, if Ryan's arm
holds up after surgery.

The weaknesses of this team
include the lack of a hitting
shortstop, of a good and regular
catcher and of a strong bullpen.

The Angels are moving up in the
standings this season, but they
don't have enough to challenge for
the title.

TEXAS:
The Rangers seemed to have it

experts picked them to win the

Whatever pitching the Rangers
had last season went to Boston in
the Ferguson Jenkinsdeal, and
whether Gaylord Perry can com-
plete another good year is a
question mark.

Nothing is won without pitching,

and the Rangers therefore will win
nothing. -
CHICAGO: Another team without
any capable. starting pitchers will
compete this season, only this one
calls itself the White Sox.

lineup will help; but it won’t be- \
