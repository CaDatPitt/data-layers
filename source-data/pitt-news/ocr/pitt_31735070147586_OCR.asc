Activities
fee to fund
green
projects

Shaé Felicien

S Staﬂ” Writer

Students’ fees for this semester were
$5 cheaper than expected.

The green fund — a proposed
$5 increase to the Student Activities
Fee —— was initially slated to ﬁnance
environmentally friendly projects
on campus, but the Student Govem—
ment Board decided against thefee
increase. ‘

Although some still refer to the
initiative as the “green fund,” there
is no extraﬁmd thatwill ﬁnance sus-
 projects on campus this
year.

Instead — just like with student
organizations ——' approved propos-
als will go through the allocations
process. '

Molly Stieber, a current Board
member, said that the current SGB
willprobably not increase the Student
Activities Fee in the ﬁxture. Instead,
the SGB created the Student Sustain-
able Projects Committee, which will
screen projects before they reach the
allocations committee.

S “We came to the idea that the
green ﬁind should be an initiative
of the Environmental Committee
of the Student Government Boar ,”
Stieber said. “The eventual goal is
for the green fund to become its own
entity.”

Currently, the Student Sustainable

Projects Committee — or, the green I

fund as some call it ——— is still looking
for more sustainability proposals.

The Book Center, Molly Stieber team up to promoteeBooks

Katherine Sandler
Staﬁ" Writer

Students’ lukewarm response to eBooks offered
through The Book Center has spurred the store
to increase its selection for next semester.

The first eBooks debuted at The Book Center
duringthe fall, although only 100 titles were avail-
able to students in the format.

Since then, The Book Centerhas signedacon-
tract with Coursesmartcom, a n eBook website.
According to its website, Coursesmartcom car-
ries more than 90 percent of all core textbooks
used in higher education today.

“Core textbooks, the intro and general classes
will be more abundant. It will be more difficult
to ﬁnd an eBook that ﬁts a niche class,” Stieber
said.

Some students are not as thrilled about the
prospect of digital textbooks.

Tequila Crockett, aPittsophomore, purchased
an eBook for her introductory speech class. Al-
though she said she can’t‘remember when she
used it, she said it was before The Book Center

Overall, Crockett said she didn’t like using
the eBook format, although she acknowledged
its usefulness for some classes.

“But for more serious and focused studying,
it wouldn’t be beneﬁcial,” she said.

Debra Fyock, Book Center manager, said in
ane—mail that she hasn’t heardfrom any students
who have similar views. .

“To date, we have had no complaints with the
rentals orthe eBooks. This suggeststo me thatthe
customers who have chosen this option seem to

With the increase in available eBook options,
Fyock said it will likely increase the number of
eBook customers. Fyock did not say how many
students used the program during the fall ‘s_e—
mester.

. The eBooks are providedto students at the in-
structors’ request, orifthe eBookdirectlymatches

eBook program, is working to rectify.

Stieber, along with The Book Center, created
a student advisory committee to enhance corre-

which will provide information and feedback to
both parties. Stieber also said a new web design
for the program is in the works to publicize the
eBook portion of The Book Center website.

Stieber also plans to speak to university de-
partments and faculty about eBooks.

When eBooks debuted at Pitt earlier this se-
mester, stndents were slow to purchase them.

“We haven’t sold many at all so far,” John
Burns, a manager at The Book Center, said dur-

New FDA images good
public health policy

a man with a hole in his throat

‘and a mother blowing smoke
into her infant child’s face might
be more appropriate than photos
of Humphrey Bogart,James Dean
or, occasionally, Megan Fox.

At least, that’s the case when
the images are printed on ciga-
rette packs.

The Food and Drug Admin-
istration announced yesterday
a proposal that would require
American tobacco companies to
print graphic images alongside
textual warnings on cigarette
packages and advertisements. The
FDA plans to ask
for public approval
of the images this
coming June, and
companies would
have until Oct. 22,
2012, to begin us-
ing them.
rwi Regardless of
how ambitious the
FDA’s plan might
be, we doubt the campaign would
have much effect on current smok-
ers — asking a addict to quit is
like asking Snooki orJohn Boeh-
ner to quit tanning.

But wedo think images of a
corpse with a tag on its toe, a dis-
eased lung or a mouth full of rot-
ting teeth might help deter people

I mages of an emaciated woman,

. who have yet to pick up a cig.

 While little scientiﬁc research
exists on the topic, it’s not hard to
believe that most young adults can
rattle off the list of smoking’s po-
tential side effects — emphysema,
lung cancer and, oh yeah, death

 

— but most see these ill effects
as relegated to the future. “Either

_ they won’t happen to me, or if they

do I’ll be too old to care,” many
young smokers seem to think.
But perhaps adding a constant,
colorful reminder to their ciga-
rette packages will make smokers
think twice — one in ﬁve Canadian
smokers reported reducing their
cigarette use after the country re-
quired companies to place graphic
warnings on them, according to
Bloomberg.Or, better yet, maybe

these vivid images will be enough-

to keep other people from smok-
ing for their ﬁrst time. 4

are divided
over the issue.
Reynolds and
Lorillard are
in the middle
of a lawsuit
over govern-
ment rules
that would
require them to add “shocking
color graphics” to their packag-
ing and advertisements, calling
the measures unconstitutional,
according to Bloomberg.

Meanwhile, tobacco industry
giant Philip Morris issued a state-
ment yesterday saying it supports
the FDA’s attempts to regulate the
industry.

In our minds, Philip Morris has
it right — any proposal that might

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN

Indiana Jones, one last ride

  
 
 

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

According to some news clip we
noticed while surﬁng the Internet,
another IndianaJones movie is in the
works. Since the last installrnentwas
probably the worst ﬁlm ever made,

any suggestions for improvement _

would result in a better production.
With that in  we have decided to
offer our two cents’ worth by sketch-
ing out a plot for “lndianajones V”
that is very now, very with it, very up-
tempo, very au courant, very ’9os and
very today. Very modern, too.

One of the things the last movie

Indianajones also needs a better
love interest. Since Harrison Ford is
nearly 90 years old, just about any
younger woman will do. A smart
choice here would be either Queen
Latifah or Mo’Nique. Both actresses
are A-listers, and they will bring all
the tools of their trade to bear in de-
veloping an “urban” or“street” iden-
tity for the ﬁlm. Most importantly,
the lovemaking scenes — which as
any true fan knows, are the heart of
an Indianajones picture —- will be
earth—shattering.

With a cast like this, there’s no
reason to skimp on plot and high
resolution special effects. “The Da
Vinci Code,” which we believe had

naive kid humping an apple pie.  

lacked was a good sidekick. Shia
‘LaBeouf tried hisbest, but he’s re-
ally only watchable when he’s ﬁght-
ing giant robots and slavering over
a scantily—clad, dead-eyed Megan
Fox. Instead of having him reprise

A his role as the son of IndianaJones,

we believe that the part should go to
Dane Cook. Why Dane Cook, you ask‘?
To which we say only: Have you ever
seenthis man? He’s a jester nonpareil,
the hottest college comic in the his-
tory ofboth colleges and comedians,
and we have no doubt that he would
inﬁise this role with the same unique

' brand ofhilaritythathas brightened

millions of lives around the globe.
Also, he has great highlights, and

story like this one.

something to do with decoding da
V'mci’s DNAinorderto ﬁgure outwho
really wrote the dollar bill, captivated
the entire nation a few years ago. Imi-
tationisthe sincerestforrn ofﬂattery,
so Indiana Jones should deﬁnitely
go in that direction. Our use of “this”
direction” here encompasses Bible
stuff, Masons, Anti-Masons, Hog-
warts, Narnia, vampires, zombies,
Mike “The Situation’? Sorrentino,-
were-bears, traveling pants-themed
sisterhoods, basketball shoes with
air pumps in them, cyber-bullying
and much more.

Perhaps the secret to the Holy
Lance is hidden inside the ink that
John Hancock used when putﬁnghis
extraordinary signature on the Decla-
ration of Independence. To get inside

the ink,Jones will have to be reduced
to microscopic size. Once there, he
will be faced with a rnind-boggling
conspiracy that spans time and space
but is nevertheless centered on the

crucial year 2012. While confronting"

the truth about2012, he and his fellow
adventurers Dane Cook and Queen
Latifah will be forced to search their
souls to discover something that’s
beyond imagination. We’re not sure
what that is, but we can guarantee
that itwill change as well as challenge
everything you know about Indiana
Jones. '

this is a recipe forasuccessful reboot
of the greatest movie franchise that
doesn’t involve a nerdy, naive kid
humping an apple pie. The only way
ourversion of “lndianajones V’f could
get better is if other legendary ﬁan-
chises, like “Ghostbusters” or maybe
“National Treasure,” are involved in
the action. All of these amazing sto-
ries shouldn’t exist in isolation, and
“triple crossing” them will lead to
megabucks at the box oﬂice.

It’s not easy to make a great movie,
but that hasn’t stopped plenty of them
from getting made. Now that it ap-
pears likely that Dr. Indianajones is
going to saddle up for one last ride,
Steven Spielberg and George Lucas
must ﬁght the urge to cut comers.
What we’ve laid out here has the po-
tential to be the best thing ever, and
that’s not something that happens all
the time. Attention must be paid;

Pitt students and faculty are the
masterminds behind “Serpents
and Doves,” a feature—length
ﬁlm involving secret societies
in Pittsburgh and their “experi—
mentation in human manipula-
tion,” according to the movie’s
synopsis’.

Gregory Allen, Pitt professor
and producer, wrote the script
chronicling Glen Regal who,
while on a quest for answers,
becomes involved with a myste-
rious group of time travelers who
decide Regal will be involved in
their human manipulation plot.

The ﬁlmmakers were keen
on keeping the whole story
very hush—hush until tonight’s
premiere, offering only a brief
description and the cryptic ta-
gline: “The biggest mistake you
can make is believing that your
life isn’t epic.”

“We want this to be as ‘open
as possible — to get the biggest
spectrum of ideas and ques-
tions, questions that we would

never even think of asking,” said I

co-director. The English writing

On the surface, “Krapp’s Last Tape”
and “Wanda’s Visit” could not be
more different. But although the
title characters “are polar oppo-
sites,” according to “Krapp’s Last
Tape” directorjordan Walsh, they
share a primary motivation —— an
unhealthy ﬁxation on the past, and

the inability to move past a long-
expired relationship.

This semester’s lab production
is a double-header, beginning with
Samuel Beckett’s 1958 one—man,
one—act “Krapp’s Last Tape” and
ending with Christopher Durang’s
1994 comedy “Wanda’s Visit.”

“Krapp’s Last Tape” centers on

_one man, just turning 70, who for

the past several decades has made
a tape every year on his birthday,
commenting on the year that has
just passed. Over the course of the
play, he listens to tapes from previ-
ous years and reﬂects on his former
self and lost loves as well as his cur-
rent state of loneliness.
“Wanda’s Visit” deals with mid-
dle-aged suburban couple Jim and
Marsha, who receive a letter from
Jim’s high school sweetheart and de-
cide to invite her to come for a visit.
As they soon ﬁnd out, Wanda has

‘ never gotten over her infatuation

withjim and rtms the couple ragged

with her inappropriate antics and
transparent attempts to Win back
her old ﬂame.

The shows vary drastically in
tone. Courtney Strauss, who plays
Wanda, ‘describes her character
as “zany  the ultimate role for a

‘comedic actress to play,” whereas
Walsh, the director of “Krapp’s
Last Tape,” describes his play as

“a downer.” Yet both hinge on the
theme of obsession with the past
and dissatisfaction with the pres-
ent.

“Jim and Marsha started out

‘their marriage wanting to have a

‘good life,’ and now they have a good
life. They’r_e comfortable, and it

sucks,” explains Brian Shaffer, who A
plays Jim in “Wanda’s Visit.” “And .

Krapp started out life wanting to be
a great writer, and regardless of his
success, it wasn’t worth it.”- A
Moira Quigley, who stars asJim’s
wife Marsha, agrees. “It’s about get-
ting what you want, but not being

happy with it. Krapp deals with that
by himself, and Jim and Marsha
deal with it  with an unwanted
guest.”

The cast admits that, atﬁrst,Jim
is nearly as eager to see Wanda as
she is to see him. “When you think
about it,” said Rachel Brookstein,
the director of “Wanda’s Visit,”
“I’m 20. Jim hasn’t seen Wanda in
20 years. I can’t imagine not see-
ing someone for the whole time I’ve
been alive, and then seeing them
again — it’s hard to picture the re-
action that she would give him.” —

Krapp also struggles ‘with the
memories of an old ﬂame. “A great
deal of it is about a relationship that
he had with a woman, but he never
gets to meet her again,” Walsh said.
“She’s stuck in his past, whereas
in ‘Wanda’s Visit’ she comes back.
[Krapp] never gets the satisfaction
of dealing with it again, he just gets
to wallow in the memories.”

Walsh feels the shows were

 

paired perfectly because, “my show
is_so heavy that theirs kind of bal-
ances it out. It’s a really good setup.
After seeing [“Krapp’s Last Tape”] ,
people are going to be so relieved to
be able to laug ._”

But the cast and director of
“Wanda’s Visit” stress that their
show isn’t all ﬁm and games.

Brookstein said, “I think it’s a
choice of the director to make it
serious or not, it could deﬁnitely
be played ﬁmny, but«I chose to make
it serious  because it’s so relatable.
Jim and Marsha are so typical and it

could be funny, but  I don’t know, -

it’s heartbreakingto watch. I think
it’s heartbreaking to watch a couple
try to ﬁnd something they’re never
going to ﬁnd.” '

“There’s so much I want to say,
but I can’t spoil the ending.” Matt
Russak, who plays the waiter in
“Wanda’s Visit,” said apologetically.
“But you won’t see it coming. You
have to come see itfor yourself.” J,

MOVIE COLUMN

Tybout takes Cameron’s ‘Avatar’ to the next several levels

Tybout takes a look at some avenues that James Cameron could take the ‘Avatar ’_ franchise down after the next two sequels -

Andy Tybout
Assistant A8-E Editor

The Notorious B.I.G. once theorized an alarming
correlation: Wi “mo’ money,” he postulated,
comes “mo’ problems.” '

Clearly, James Cameron is not a Biggie fan.

After making “Avatar,” the highest-grossing
ﬁlm in history, Cameron announced that he’ll
follow his magnum opus with two sequels —
both ﬁlmed at the helm of newtechnologies too
complex for the layman to comprehend.

To. some, this may; seem sensible, at least
from an economic standpoint +— the main
reason “Avatar” was successﬁil was because
it revolutionized speiciali effects. But who’s to

say where Cameron’s obsessions will leadhim ,

after “Avatar 3”? What sort of demented gim-

micks will he attempt to charmel in “Avatar 4?” -

“Avatar 40?”

Rather than wait to ﬁnd out, I’ve compiled a
list of potential “Avatar” interpretations Carn-
eron might employ if given free reign by movie
studios. . . V

“Avatar4-D”: Whenaudiences don their 4-D
glasses, theywill attain the ability to experience
“Avatar” not only in dimensions of space, but

out of the screen, characters will channel back in
history to alter previous ﬁlms in the franchise.

Essentially, it’s an overly complex means of
creating a ﬂashback. But be warned: should

you remove your glasses during the middle of
the ﬁlm, you may become lost in the fabric of
space-time.

“Avatar on Ice”: A disastrous endeavor.
Lanky blue aliens with cumbersome tails veer
uncontrollably about, the dragon~like crea-
tures remain grounded and there’s something ’
less than sinister about a colonel on ice skates.
Robbed of an opportunity to present audiences
with a ﬂashy new technology, “Avatar on Ice”
embodies the campy sadness of Cameron’s “Pi—
ranha Part Two: The Spawning,” more than its
source material. ’

losing a considerable sum of money after the
“Avatar on Ice” ﬁasco, Cameron’s produc-
tion budget is scaled back. Now, “Avatar” is a
sparsely attended slam poetry series hosted
in coffee shops. The events’ sole attendees are
hipsters, and these fans only enjoy the shows
ironically. -

 
 
   

“Avatar: The VH1 Special”: Everyone loves
VH1 specials, even if they’re erratic and feature
talking heads nobody has heard of. At least, this
is the assumption guiding Cameron’s money-
grubbing foray into television, during which
pop-culture pundits — including the omni-
presentjwowwand Pauly D -— count down
the best moments of the ﬁanchise. The show
is a critical bomb, but rakes in enough cash to
sustain the franchise for another 250—some
installments.

“Avatar 251”: Cameron, sustained cryogeni-
cally in aremote moon colony owned by 20th
Century Fox, ﬁnally musters the ﬁnances he
needs to achieve his lifelong goal for the fran-
chise: to make aﬁlm so technologically omnipoﬁ
tent that it supplants reality itself. Channelingall
his life’s earnings into special effects too sophis-
ﬁcated and terrible for the 21st-century mind
to comprehend, “Avatar 251” is not a movie so
much as it is an intergalactic amusement park:
Cameron has, quite literally, created the planet
Pandora that appeared in the original “Avatar.”
Audiences are invited to experience the “ﬁlm”
by j oumeying to the environment and bearing
witness to its tribe of noble blue aliens and their
dramatic ﬁght for survival ﬁrsthand.

Critical and commercial reaction, how-
ever, is tepid, and “Saw 729” bumps the ﬁlrfi
into second place at the box office. Despite
the bloated production budget, Cameron has
succeeded only in making another popcom-
movie experience, with all the canned dialogue,
generic narratives and archetypal characters
that implies.’

Furious and unable to grasp the reasons for
this failure, Cameron regresses into a perma-
nent state of depression. A small consolation,
however, for fans of the director: against all
odds, “Titanic” is still popular.

Co-directors keep
mum about film plot

Serpents 4 8

Courtesy Alisha B. Wormsley

Andrew Wormsley’s grandmother, Mattie Butler, and great aunt, Minnie King, who were

invested in the ﬁlm after taking classes
with Allen and being invited by the profes-
sor to join. This is his ﬁrst directing gig
in a movie of this magnitude.

It was also his co-director Andrew
Wormsley’s ﬁrst big project. The 2001
Westminster University graduate ap-
proached Allen about an idea he had for a
movie. After several conversations during
which Allen told Wormsley he needed to
learn to write a screenplay, Allen invited
Wormsley to join the project.

“We’re taking it from words on the pa-
per to actually manifesting into the ﬁlm,”
Wormsley said. ~

Although the ﬁlm is part of a four-part
series, the directors assure audiences that
the plot of ‘/‘Serpents and Doves,” can stand

on its own. Jenkins compares it to the -

“Twilight Zone” were each installment is
its own separate story.

Co-directing would seem problematic,
butjenkins and Wormsley agree that they
synthesized well creatively and rarely dis-
agreed. In fact, thoughthey each worked
on scenes separately, they believe the au-
dience won’t be able to tell.

“They worked well together and they
communicated well, so they knew what
direction to take the ﬁlm and usually it
would be one or the other when we were
doing a scene,” said Ryan French, an actor
in the ﬁlm and a Pitt senior. French was
also brought in by Allen, who insisted he
would be perfect in the role of Brad, who
starts the movie as one of Regal’s best
friends.

In addition to directing, Wormsley said
he also played the role of fundraiser. He
asked family, friends and coworkers for
donations, which supplemented a gener-

ous gift from one of the producers. In total,
he estimates that their budget was $5,000.
On such a tight budget, the directors had
several jobs.

“We’ve worn so many hats through this
process and Chris and I have been involved
in every aspect of this ﬁlm except writing
the script,” Wormsley said.

Wormsley explained that in a Holly-

wood production with a big budget there"
are several jobs — for examplefcasting

director, production coordinator, location
scout and wardrobe manager —— that he
andjenkins took on. They also had a hand
in editing, music and promotion, for which
they primarily used Facebook. _

But the ﬁlm crew was fortunate be-
cause it didn’t have to spend much money
on equipment. A Pitt student production
group, The Sprocket Guild, donated the
use of its devices for video, sound and
other technical aspects of the ﬁlm. This
allowed the group to put money towards
things like paying actors and booking cer-
tain locations. _

Several of the ﬁlm locations are on
Pitt’s campus. Though some might think
the Cathedral is best suited for eerie scenes
about secret societies,Jenkins decided to
use other options on Pitt’s campus.

“The Cathedral — that’s cliché. We have
to use the other creepy building on cam-
pus,” such as Posvar Hall, Jenkins said.

The directors insist that the best way to
ﬁnd out the story is by actually seeing the
ﬁlm, explaining that they hope the movie
allows the audience members to reﬂect on
their own lives. But, Wormsley did give one
more cryptic hint about the plot: “There’s
a ripple effect to everything you do.” I

cant lead. =

The Panthers, led :4

by guards Ashton Gibbs and Brad
Wanamaker, never trailed the
Flames en route to a 97-54 win.

Gibbs scored 15 of his 24
points off 3-pointers, ﬁnishing
the game 5 for 10 from behind
the arc.

Gibbs said his success from
the perimeter was a result of
Illinois-Chicago defensive gaps
that were identified by the Pan-

‘ thers.

“I was just taking advantage of
what the defense gave me,” Gibbs
said. “After our players kicked it
back outside, I just had to knock
down the three.”

Wanamaker complemented
his 17-point performance with
nine assists and six rebounds.

Gibbs and Wanamaker were
the top scorers for the Panthers
(2-0) for the second game in a
row, but Wanamaker acknowl-
edged the importance of having
a balanced scoring effort.

“When: we havepmultiple play-
ersvcontributing, it keeps the de-

_hon'est,” he said, referring
fto the-33 points added by the Pan-

ther bench. “When Ashton and I
are both‘a‘e/t‘i_tacking, itgives teams

"more to worry about.”

Gibbs added to that notion of
team contribution by referencing

the "‘big men” — senior center '
. Gary McGhee, sophomore for-

ward Dante Taylor and redshirt
freshman forward Talib Zanna
—— and their play underneath the
basket.

“The big men are working
hard in practice and it is showing
on the court,” he said. “They do
good work under the basket and

v the best is yet to come.”

' McGhee and Taylor each
pulled down eight rebounds last
night as the Panthers earned 45
total rebounds in comparison to

the Flames’ 25.
Defensively, Pitt held Illinois-

Chicago to just 38 percent from

the ﬁeld, while.the Panthers ﬁn-
ished the game with a 57.8 per-
cent ﬁgure, which was largely

. impacted by their 70 percent

second-half shooting.

While the Panthers ﬁnished V

with a 43-point margin of victory,
they led by only 14 points at the
half after a performance that left
the Panthers dissatisfied.

“We weren’t happy with the
ﬁrst half,” Gibbs said. “We could
haveipllayed tougher and stron-
ger, and that is what Coach Dixon
stressed during halftime.”

Coachjamie Dixon was pleased
with his team’s response and its
ability to sustain the lead in the
second half.

"‘I was impressed by the way
we improved throughout the
game,” he said. “It is difﬁcult to
keep a large lead and build upon
it — but we did, and that was
encouraging.” . e

“Theyare similar in a lot of

To see dream BCS matchup, Auburn must lose

GA potential Oregon vs. TCU championship game would pit nation’s best offense, defense against each other

Greg Trietley
Senior_Staﬁ" Writer

My apologies to the Auburn Tigers, but
they have to lose.

Auburn stands in the way of the best BCS
National Championship Game matchup
imaginable. Sitting atop the BCS standings
is Oregon, the highest scoring team in the
nation. Meanwhile, in third place, the TCU '
Horned Frogs have the best defense in
the country, averaging 8.5 points against
per game. ’

Stuck right between them and thwart-
ing this unstoppable force vs. immovable
object showdown are the Tigers, the best
team in the nation’s best conference. They,
not the Horned Frogs, are the shoo—in to
face Oregon in the title game —— provided
they win their ﬁnal three games.

Auburn beat tough teams like Clemson,
South Carolina, Arkansas and LSU en route
to its current 10-0 record. The Tigers still
have to play Georgia this weekend, pre-
season darling Alabama in Tuscaloosa on‘
Nov. 26 and whoever they will face in the
SEC Championship, most likely Florida or

South Carolina.
An 8-0 conference record and an SEC
Championship would give the Tigers

the best resume in the country. Auburn,

though, isn’t close to being the best team
in the country. That title belongs to Or-
egon.

Here’s a string of numbers for you: 72,

48, 69, 42, 52. 43, 60. 53 and 53. Those .

21-3 lead over them. By the time the game
ended, though, Oregon had made its state-
ment, scoring. 52 points and shutting out
the Cardinals in the second half.

The best part: Stanford actually held
the Ducks under their season average of

from the Mountain West and Jamie Dixon’s
alma mater to boot. A

Here’s another string of numbers: 21, 7,
10, 24, 0, 0, 3, 7, 6 and 7. Those are TCU’s
week—to-week points-against totals. The
Horned Frogs have given 'up three touch-
downs since the end of September.

They went into Utah and stomped the
Utes, 47-7. Utah hadn’t lost at home in 21
games, let alone by 40 points. Utah joined
Oregon State, Baylor, Air Force, Brigham
Young and others on TCU’s list of van-
quished opponents.

It’s not a resume that can contend with
Auburn’s, but it’s not just about resumes.

‘ TheHorned Frogs are the most dominant ‘

defense in the nation. Facing the most dom-
inant offense in the nation for the national
championship makes too much sense.

For once, the BCS system, which so
rarely does anything but cause ulcers, can
get it right — but only if Auburn gets out
of the way. I

Panthers dominate
second half

Men’s basketball 4 11 _

Flames’ turnovers.

“We generated points from Illinois— Chi-
cago’s mistakes,” Dixon said. “I was very
pleased with that aspect of our second—half
improvement.” _

With its second win of the year, Pitt’s
home winning streak against nonconfer—
ence opponents was increased to 49 games
since 2005- a school record.

For Dixon, the fact that the Panthers are

2-0 this early in the season is a sign that
they are gaining valuable experience.

“Not many teams have two wins at this
point in the year,” Dixon said. “It is an
advantage to this team.”

The Panthers will play their ﬁnal home ‘ .

overtime victory over West Virginia, their
only victory over a Big East opponent in
three games. - _ g
“I think that if you look back over the
years, at least since I’ve been here, our
game with Connecticut has always been a
very challenging one,” Wannstedt said.

And he expects tonight’s game to be

no different.

“Their style gives them a chance to be
successful,” he said of the Huskies. “When
you can recruit good backs, run the ball
and put together a solid defense, you’re

going to have a chance to win every week

regardless of who you’re playing. That’s‘
been their philosophy and that’s what has
helped to make a difference.”
.' The Huskies also spent this week talking
about tonight’s' game. ,
Connecticut’s top rusher is juniorjordan
Todman, who leads the Big East in the posi-

tiorrwith 136.29"yards'"rus'hi'n‘g per game. "

Todman said his team is up for the tough
task of knocking off the Panthers.
“If someone is on top like Pittsburgh, of

course you are going to try and knock them
down,” Todman said in a news conference.
“They bring the pressure and they are a
very competitive team that will give us a
challenge and we expect that going into
the game Thursday.” _

Aiding the Panthers is news that star
defensive end Greg Romeus, who had back
surgery on Sept. 16, practiced withthe
team most of this week.

_ Wannstedt will decide at gametime
whether to let Romeus play. But even if
Romeus can’t ‘play, his fellow defensive
linemen have excelled this season. Jabaal

Lsheard is tied for sixth in the nation in

sacks with nine while Brandon Lindsey has

had a breakout year in replacing Romeus, %

collecting eight sacks. ~
The biggest breakout player for the _Pan—

thers so far this season might be quarter-

back Tino Sunseri. He struggled early in the

season, but through thr'ee‘Big East games i

Sunseri has collected 711 yards-(237 yards
per game) and has thrown seven touch-

_ downs to only one interception. I
