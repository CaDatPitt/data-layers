The sororities will keep ’em
moving when free X—ray units
come to the Pitt Schenley Room
on the ﬁrst ﬂoor, Monday.

During the two-week stay of
the units, Greek women will see
that a steady stream of students
ﬂows through the three machines
from 9:30 a. m. to 4:30 p. m. In-
dividual sororities will be on duty
each day.

Campaign organizers emphasize
the fact that students need not
wait to be asked to get their
x-rays taken.

In order to have the results for-
warded student must register their
names and addresses at the time
the x-rays are taken. Results are
usually in the mail within ten
days.

The present campaign is spon-
sored by the United States Health
Service. The national health serv-
ice is working in conjunction with
the Pittsburgh Health ‘Depart-
ment.

Publicity for the drive has ac-.
cented its simplicity. Less than
one minute is required for the
x-ray. It is taken without the re-
moval of any clothes.

Also accented is public ignor-
ance regarding this disease which
took 300 lives in Pittsburgh last
year.

 Cops Come Through

Ticket. speculators, or “scalpers” as they
are more commonly called, were mighty

. scarce at the Pitt Stadium last Saturday. There.

' on the part of police broke upiwhat

just weren’t any. Nor was the usual throng of
souvenir salesmen clustered around the sta-
dium, obstructing traﬁic and pestering the fans..

Credit for a ﬁne piece of work should go
to Inspector John M. Flavin of the Oakland
police station. He and his crew of ofﬁcers kept
things straightened ‘out very nicely.

At one time, trouble was averted when a
group of students tried to get onto the play-
ing ﬁeld to recapture the tail of the panther
which had been taken, rather unkindly, by
members of the Ohio State band. Quick action
might have
been a serious brawl. ~ »

The. police directed the victory happy

crowd quickly and efficiently; no small task.

Thank you, Inspector.

C
Lone Artist
With our enrollment at its present peak,
all the departments are crowded. Every instruc-
tor is over-taxed. However we have foiinii‘ an
instructor who is virtually his department staff.

The present studio system can notaccom-
modate one half of all those students who
would like to elect courses in creative art.

«Moreover students already enrolled can not

receive the ‘individual guidance which is neces-
sary for them to beneﬁt from their art work.
We are certain that the faculty appreciates
the value of instruction in creative art. How-
ever we have noticed the gradual expanding
of our art history department, while in spite
of present enrollment and student demand the
studio staff still remains listed to one in struc-
tor.

Though our one art instructor is carrying
a maximum schedule, the studio is not in con-
stant use. With this consideration, an enlarged
staff and an increased number of studio classes

would give more students the opportunity to

elect creative art courses, and by bringing
about a better distribution of students, these
_changes would increase the effectiveness of in-
struction. . ' --

If the faculty adds new members to the
studio staff, We are sure the students will do
their part in responding. Students do not nec-

, essarily have to possess artistic ability in order

iportuni

_to proﬁt by art work. Their whole appreciation

of art is enhanced when they realize the skill
it takes to produce a special brush stroke or
color. Moreover the creative art class affords

the men and women of our university an op-
ty to gain an L

 Soclal

Workshop Advocatecl
For Radio Aspirants ,

Pitt has one of the ﬁnest creative Writing departments in the
country. The success of many of its graduates testiﬁes to the quality

of the instruction they received.

The speech department has also turned out its“ share of high-
grade talent, particularly in the radio writing courses.

Students in these courses would be materially aided by the es-
tablishment of some facilities‘ for radio production work. TheUni-

versity has none whatsoever.-
In ever increasing numbers to-

day, colleges across the country
are operating their own on-cam-
pus radio stations; even college
networks have been formed. ,Stu-
dents participating in such setups
receive valuable training under
conditions very similar to those in
the actual ﬁeld in which they in-
tend to work.
Idea Beneﬁcial

Speaking of this training, Mr.
George Gailey, program manager
of station WPIT says, “I think
such an idea would deﬁnitely be
beneﬁcial to students learning ra-
dio broadcasting technique.”

Pitt students, at least partly
through unfavorable circum-
stances have been and are being
denied the advantages which ac-
crue from a campus-operated ra-
dio station. V

The University’s location in .-a

metropolitan district which al-

ready boasts over seven major
radio stations coupled with lack
of campus dormitories prohibits
installation of a station ‘at the
school.

Several of the stations in Pitts-
burgh have indicated interest in
working out a plan in which they
could work in cooperation with
the University. Perhaps a studio
on campus could run a power line
to one of the stations in town.

Pitt Had Studio
In 1924, the University opened.a

studio in State Hall which broad-

cast through the facilities of
KDKA three ‘ times a week on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fri-
days. A line was rented from the
phone company to carry’ the half-
hour shows from the basement
studio to the down-town trans-
mitten.

Faculty ‘members, however,
were the only speakers. An ar-
rangement such as the school had
before would be of great beneﬁt
to any student taking part in it.
Of course, it would help the radio
stations by supplying a source of

freed!-trainee tal

  
  

A
V

If a studio at Pitt should prove
impractical, a -workshop with
simulated conditions would be
beneﬁcial to students in the ra-
dio, speech, writing and engi-
neering courses as well as mem-
bers of the student acting organ-
izations.

Need Trained Men

At station KQV, Mr. James F.
Murray, station manager said,
“There is a deﬁnite need for uni-
versity trained radio graduates in
this area. Our station tries to fool-
l-ow a policy of hiring as many
district people as possible and
often it’s difficult to make re-
placements because of the lack of
trained local applicants.”

General manager of radio sta-
tion KDKA stated, "We think this
is a ﬁne idea and hope to have the
opportunity of discussing the de-
tails further with University offi-
cials. We also feel that the Uni-
versity should have a complete
setup to provide for adequate
workshop facilities there.”

Southwestern
Opens Station

Winﬁeld, Kans. (IP)-—A broad-
casting studio is to be established
this year in the new ﬁne arts
building at Southwestern college,
according to announcement made
by President Mearl P. Culver.

The plans now in the process
of realization will include control
room, main studio, auxiliary studio
and an ofﬁce. Three extension
loops will connect the console with
Richardson Hall auditorium, the
press booth -at the new stadium
and Stewart Fieldhouse thus mak-
ing it possible to broadcast pro-
grams from these points.

An agreement has been enter-
ed into with radio station’ KSOK
at Arkansas City for broadcasting
a daily program from the South-
western studio. Personnel for op-
eration of control‘ room, script
writing, and announcing will be
trained by KSOK oﬁicials. Stu-
dents will be given opportunity
to receive this training and to

_"Sfompin' ‘at the Savoy"
With Dizzy Gillespie;
Chief of the Be-bopperls

Notes
By Jerry Newberg--—---

The Savoy sure will be jumpin’ next Friday . .
evening. Why? Because the be-pop man Dizzy G11-
lespie, his solid trumpet and terriﬁc band will be‘
giving out with some of the sharpest music varia-
tions you’ve ever heard. , _ -3,

To jazz lovers all over the world, the name 
Dizzy Gillespie is synonymous with the most mod-
ern developments in jazz—known variously as be-
pop or bere-bop. Dizzy worked hard to gaiiithis‘
distinction. He traveled throughout the country i
with bands like Cab ‘Calloway, Benny Carter, Char-
lie Barnet, Earl Hines, John Kirby and Duke El-
lington. '

When Dizzy was co-leader of a 52nd Street band, .
he really started to _express his musical ideas. Not
long afterwards he formed his own band and de.
voted all his attention to the development of the‘
jazz style. Soon he became know as the unofﬁcial
“chief of the be-boppers.” - . T

In recognition of Dizzy’s achievement as a trum-
peter, Esquire and other jazz publications have be-
stowed upon him their highest honors. Also, the-
New Jazz Foundation has named him “the young ,
man who has made the greatesticontribution t
contemporary music.” '

Many of, Dizzy’srecent recordings "have. been
waxed on the Musicraft label. ~

department, at a meeting, of the
West Central Pennsylvania Edu-

Miss Thralls stated that the po-

litical turmoil in India today,
which has shaken the country to
its foundations, is due largely to
the great differences of language
and religion among its peoples.

Nine great religions, six distinct
languages, and 130 dialects create
almost insurmountable barriers to
unity.

‘Congress Stumped
By Wallace Offer

A student Congress committee is juggling a hot potato in the
form of an offer by Henry A. Wallace to address the student body
during his stay in Pittsburgh. He will speak here Nov. 10 in Syria

Congress received the offer two weeks ago through a faculty

was withheld while a committee

under Bob Ingrim studied the possibilities or political repurcussions

It was suggested that if Wallace were to speak here a speaker
holding opposite views be engaged to follow up the address at a_.

The committee is still ponder-

sity students and administration
heads to measure the Pitt reac-
tionto such an offer.

Meanwhile, Pittsburgh’s Pro-
gressive Citizens of America, who
are sponsoring the Syria Mosque
appearance, got a well-organized
campaign under way with mem-
bers distributing literature pub-
licizing both the Wallace speech
and the organization itself.

In addition to the Nov. 10
speech, PCA’s tentative plans for
Wallace's stay include a press
conference the next morning, fol-
lowed by an address at the Car-
negie-Illinois Homestead Works.

The organization hopes to hold
a student rally sometime in the
afternoon of the eleventh at Flag-
staff Hill at which Wallace also
will speak. .

Since his widely-publicized re-

‘ tirernent from national office. and

“On Your Toes" Tentative Title

 

  

 

Of Cap 6:. Gown's Latest Show

Wilbur Hansen,'at the piano, as he appeared in last years “Cap
and Gown” show. Hansen is the co-author of the new “Cap and
Gown” production which goes into rehearsal as soon as G.W.S.H.

gasps its last.

Prospects of the “Great Ameri-
can Play” loomed in the future as
Cap and Gown announced that it
plans to produce a student writ-
ten play for its 1947 show.

The play, tentatively titled “On
Your Toes” was authored by Wil-
bur Hansen and Ken Phifer.

This will be the ﬁrst student-
written play accepted by the Cap
and Gown Association since 1940.

The story tells of a show troop
which has ﬁnished a world tour
and is on its way to Hollywood to
make a.picture. “The entire story
is satirical of Hollywood tech-
nique,” says Hansen. ,

Hansen also remarked that the
story “utilizes very unusual‘set-
tings, the ﬁrst scene taking place
ab-hoard ship, and the second scene,
partly on a Hollywood sound stage
and partly in an exclusive night
club.” He also made it known that
practically all of the speaking
parts are leading roles.

Hansen, a freshman in the law
school, appeared as pianist in last
year’s Cap and Gown show, “Kil-
roy is Here.” The musician-writer
also leads a musical aggregation
known as the “Will Hansen So-
ciety Quartet.”

Ken Phifer, a college Junior,
had the dance lead in last year’s
production. Ken has studied danc-
ing in Pittsburgh and New York
for 15 years and is now teaching
dancing in Wilkinsburg.

It Doesn't Take Long
.To Find That Frat Boys
Take IF Football Seriously -

Do frat boys take intramural sports seriously? You can bet
your life they do. Last week, the Sports Desk was besieged by presi-
dents of three or four fraternities who demanded recognition for

their touch football sixes.

Our two football writers at Shadyside were accused of being
pro PiKA. It was pretty hectic. Now, before this gets around and
Student Congress demands a probe, let me assure all frat boys

that we are neutral. .

Among the IM football reporters there seems to be general agree-
ment the PiKA has the most powerful touch football six. Barring
a large scale disaster, they are a shoo-in to retain the IM cham-

pionship.

Surprisingly enough, certain
members of PiKA have register-
ed complaints. “We have to live
with those guys,” they explained,
“so cut down on the publicity.”

Coverage Will Improve

The answer to both parties re-
mains: Everybody likes to read
about a winner and as long as
PiKA remains on top, we have to
follow. newspaper practice and
feature them.

However, we will improve our
coverage and try to mention as
many of the other teams as is
possible. The oddest partof the
entire hubbub is the good old In-
dependents.

The Independents haven’t said a
word ‘either way. They continue to
play just for the fun and the hell
with the publicity.

Some Pitt-OSU Jottings

Wes Fesler should be promi-
nently mentioned for optimist of
the year honors this December.
Why Fesler was disappointed --
and so obiviously-—after losing to
Pitt issomewhat of a mystery.

The eleven he ﬁelded Saturday
was the weakest aggregation Pitt
has faced this season. A point
worth mentioning is Fesler’s short
memory.

Early in the third quarter, the
Buckeyes were on the Pitt two-
yard line with a fourth down com-
ing up. Verdova tried bucking the
center of the Pitt line and was
tossed back to the Pitt four. The
Panthers, of course, took posses-
sion on downs.

Fesler Forgot Barkouskie

How could Fesler ever forget
that Bernie Barkouskie plays left
guard for Pitt? Maybe next year

Verdova will remind Wes. It's
going to be a long season for OSU.
They tackle Indiana, Northwest-
ern, Illinois, and Michigan.

In order to silence News Sports
Reporter Max Scherb, it’s neces-
sary to mention Paul Rickard’s
key block in the fourth quarter.
Scherb has repeated the details
everyday since the Saturday tilt.

The spectators were watching
Carl " DePasqua pitch the touch-
down toss to Bimbo Cecconi. On
the play Rickards went over and
ﬂattended the OSU right end.
Okay, Max? ‘

Before c-losing, a “nice going” to
the coaching staff and the entire

team. It was in every respect a
team victory.

Locals Trample

  Sue Six, 34-0 I

Scoring in every quarter, the L0-
cals trampled Sue Six, 34-0, Tues-
day at Shadyside ﬁeld. With this
victory, the locals climbed into a
ﬁrst place tie with the Tangle-
-feet of the Independent League.
Both have won three games.

Unable to’ halt the aggressive
charging of the Locals, the Sue Six
were bottled up in their own ter-
ritory most of the game.

On the ﬁfth play of the ﬁrst
quarter the Locals scored when
Bob Wicks tossed a 30-yard pass
to “Tank” Valacenti. Later, Wicks
again heaved a TD effort, this time
a 35-yard spiral to “Moe” Moore.

evening. ,

Freshman team candidates will
begin practice the second week of

Cassian,o's Report Clouds?  
Hopes For Seco

nd

  
 

 

Win 

By Maxwell P. Scherb

Mike Milligan hung his victory smile among the mothballs as
he prepared his Panthers for the man—sized job of tripping Minne-
sota’s rebounding Gophers. The reports that Scout Dick Cassiano
turned in were enough to make a happier man than Mike frown.

Cassiano described the Minnesotan’s performances against Michi-
gan and Illinois in glowing praise. The Golden Gophers dropped both
of these games although they outplayed both powerhouses. Most of
the credit belongs to Bierman’s higly-rated front line.

Michigan and Illinois, the only two teams to whom Minnesota
has lost, had to take to the air-lanes to score. Neither team ac-
quired as much yardage on the ground as the Minneapolismen. Michi-
gan unveiled a new formation to complete their game winning pass.

Bernie Bierman’s team is young°
and inexperienced — 30 of the
ﬁrst 40 men are sophomores --
but to date their only weakness
has been pass defense. This fault
lies not with the linemen who
rush the passers hard, but_ with
the poor coverage by the backs.

Sipping from Jug,

Every time a Michigan back
faded back to throw, a host of
golden jersies poured in on him.
Toward the end of the game, it
was noticed that the Wolverine
blockers began to shy away from
the punishing blows.

. Midwestern rumor mongers
claim this hopped-up perfomance
came from occasional swigs from
the “Little Brown Jug”—sym-
bolic prize in the Gopher-Wol-*
verine rivalry. ’

Leon Nomellini, a 246—pound
guard, has aroused “ohs” and
“ahs” from spectators who have
seen him in action. This powerful
boy picked up a Michigan center
and hurled him at Halfback Bob
Chappuis.

‘Nomellini’s greatest weakness is
his inability to play unless arous-
ed. Mike Milligan suggests having
175-pound Pitt Guard Earl Sump-
ter feed the giant chocolates to
humor him.

Gophers Line Big _

Bernie Bierman’s line averages
209 pounds. Besides Nemollini,
the starting wall will see Bud
Grant and Larry Halenkamp at
the ends; Dean Widseth and Bob
Mealy tackles; and Larry Olson-
ski at the other guard. Warren
Beason will center.

While the backs are not on a
par with the line for all around
performance, they are improving
with experience. Frank Kuzma or
Bill Elliot is called on for plung--
ing. Glen Pullens, a 158-pound
colored boy, does most of the
breakaway running. Everett
Faunce handles the passing and
punting.

Offensively, the Minneapolis
team runs from a modiﬁed “T’.’
or sometimes they shift into a
single wing. The line is constant-
ly unbalanced to the right. When
Pitt gets its hands on the ball,
the Gophers will defend their ter-
ritory from a 5-4-2 defense.

DiMatteo Set

To Repeat '42
Gopher Game

Minnesota is on tomorrow’s
menu, and if there is any Panther

player licking his chops, it is Tony”

DiMatteo.
A Back in 1942 the Gophers hand-
ed Pitt a 50-7 shellacking, but

DiMatteo tucked his head down.

and charged like a bull 98 yards

up the middle of the ﬁeld for -

Pitt’s only touchdown. Tony be-
came prominent overnight.
DiMatteo Halfback Again
At- the time, DiMatteo was a
left halfback but this season -

his second since 1942 -— he has

been called into service as a full-
back. Prior to last week’s Ohio
State game, he was reconverted
to halfback as substitute for Bim-
bo Cecconi. ,

Cecconi, who is a little fellow,
gets a thorough bumping around
on the ﬁeld, so DiMatteo sees
plenty of action despite his sec-
ond-string standing. , V

This is one of the few cases
where a player is elated over a
demotion to second string. “I

never was a fullback,’_’ said Tony.-

“I’m. much fore comfortable at
half, although-I can’t say exactly
why.”
Working With Passes

In the Ohio State game he was
a much improved player. Observ-
ers believe that the extra two
steps taken by a halfback permit
Tony to pick up more speed.

Coach Mike Milligan is delight-
ed over DiMatteo’s showing, too,
but he continues his approach to
the Minnesota game in aspirit of

gloom. All week he, has been‘

walking around mumbling, “Min-
nesota has big boys, awful big
boys.”

Scouts have pointed out, how-
ever, that the Gophers may prove

vulnerable , in’ pass defense, so’

Mike has been‘ whipping up an
aerial attack. In practice the backs
have been throwing long passes,
short passes, jump passes, and
lateral passes.

Of Pill Choice
OverBuckeyes

Amid the tumult Monday, ﬁve
young men pranced about Oak-
l_and with their noses proudly
pointed skyward.

They had snubbed the odds-
makers and overlooked the vast

- . local pessimism early last" -week,

all five boldly choosing the Pan-
thers over Ohio State in their

_ weekly forecast. How right they

were!

With only a month to go, the
News pigskin p r e d i c t o r s are

-bunched like iron ﬁlings on a

magnet.’ In fact, they are so close
that amazing John Golightly, the
ladwho was far out on the tail)
of the forecasters several weeks
ago, is now conceded a chance to
end up in the “money.”
However, Golightl will have to
batter through the rest of the
ﬁeld. ~ Max Scherb, last week’s
leader, has slipped into a tie with
Jolting Joe Santone and Doc (I
Picked Columbia) Gifﬁn. This trio
possesses .727 averages.

. Myron (Front Page) Kopelman,
still ﬁghting vigorously to grab
the ‘leaders’ coattails, has upped
his percentage to .709, just one
game off the prognosticating pace.
Good, old, inaccurate Consensus is
still dogging Kopelman. V

Our boy Golightly of course is

“low man on the totempole” with

a .673 count.

Frosh Squad Loaded

 Wi’rh Good

Tackles

With the loss of Jack Durishan and Marty Rosepink leav-

ing a gap to plug at the tackle

slot, the Panthers began prowl-

ing Western Pennsylvania for new tackle recruits. The result:
an overabundance of good tackle prospects for the freshman

football quad.
Faced with the problem

of good tackles and little of

anything else, Dr. Charles Hartwig, freshman line coach, took

a hint from postwar activities and9

instituted some of his own recon-
version. V
Flint Green, sturdy 200 pound
all—state tackle from New Kens-
ihgton, works even more effeciVe-
ly as a guard. At present, how-
ever, Green has a bad leg keeping
him out of practice. '
Black Made Back
‘After playing tackle for six
years in junior and senior high
school, Jim Black, six foot, 210
pounds lineman moves to the
 blocking back
spot of quar-
terback in the
single Wing.

Staying Put I

Without a doubt, Nick Bolkova
tops the squad of 45 freshman as
the best player of the outﬁt. Nick
is one tackle staying where he
started. Bolkovac stands six foot,
one inch and weighs 215 pounds—-
deﬁnitely big-enough for tackle.

Bolkovac began his playing
career’ at Wilson high school,
Youngstown, Ohio, but originally
hails from McKees Rocks. During
his ‘high school days, Nick also
played basketball, but football was
his mainstay. '

All-Ohio Lineman

The transplanted Pennsylvanian
starred as a tackle, being select-
ed as an all—Ohio lineman last
year.

Schedule-less, the freshman
squad plods along "with Coaches
Doc Hartwig and Ralph Mitterling
stressing fundamentals and basic
single wing plays. Only intra-
squad scrimmages ‘liven the han-
dicapped freshman aggregation.

ning attack combined with good

What p1;oved to be the winning marker came early in the first

quarter when Frank Doughertyé
zoomed over from the ‘six yard
line. From then on it was bang,
bang, bang, 'with the American
League leaders scoring at will in
every period.
"Smith Connects to Girmain

The loser’s only scoring bid
came late in the ﬁrst quarter. Dan-
ny Smith connected with a short
pass to Mike Girmain that carried
to the PiKA nine.

In another attraction which fea-
tured brilliant pass receiving, the
Dental Seniors rolled over Psi
Omega, 27-6. Displaying a pair
of versatile backs in Barry Mol-
nick and Don DeLancey, the vic-

never headed. .
DeLancey Runs 60 Yards

Although there was only one
touchdown in the second half, that
one proved to be the most excit-
ing payoff play. DeLancey, who
indicated. by his kic-koffs and
snagging of passes his ability on
the football ﬁeld, demonstrated his
prowess as a runner.

Taking the required

swivel—hipped the safety man out

of his shoes, and loped 60 yards
to the end zone.

this week by Professor N. L.’
Buck, department head.

The steam laboratory, devoted
to the study of stearn‘and its ap-
plication to prime movers, will be
