Charles Morris Veach: we met
him at a printer friend of ours,
busy preparing another edition of
the World’s Headlight. The World's
Headlight, official or unofficial,
proclaims: “VVe turn. the light on
them before other papers knowl
who or where they are.”

Mr. Veach is a short, swarthy,
stocky middle-aged gentleman,

with a smile
and a Domain.
He speaks by
contorting the
English lan-
guage, draws
analogies where
analogies were
never drawn
before, a n (1

Headlight, Mr. Veach “has taken-—.-.

He recently called Wall -Street the
name:’ ‘The Domain of Conﬁscat-
ed Privileges Beyond the Dimen-
sions of the people.’ ”

As Mr. Veach-explains it, his
machine, which will ‘solve all
problems, stop at no barriers, re-
vise and revolutionize the func-
tion and organization of the world
and its concomitant civilization, is
operated without any of the ac-
cepted modes of power. The Veach ,
machine, the inventor points out,
runs on air.

What’s $2, 000, 000?

Little ‘known. to Pittsburgh, Mr.
Veach is famous in central Penn-
sylvania for the automobile that
ran on exploding particles-of air,
and which he might have sold to

 

Henry Ford, had it not exploded ‘

some years ago in its trips to De-_
troit while parked in a small town-
en route.

From, all
reports which we are. willing to
accept, we learn that Mr. Veach
has sold several inventions to the
Du Pont corporation, the proceeds
of which he is presently using for

experimentation,‘ radio broadcasts, '

and publication of his World’s

Headlight.

Recently he sent a letter to the
Emperor of Japan, demanding
that he immediately cease attacks
on China, or he, Veach, would
send one of his machines and six-
teen men to the Orient and “blow
Japan and the Emperor off the
face of the earth.” And he means
it.

Record For Twherculiisi Tests 

swore Report

“A remarkable record '-has be—e.1”i¢

made by University students in
‘supporting the Tuberculin test
drive‘ instituted by The Pitt News
and thestudent health services,
said Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of
the men’s health service today..

“You will remember that in the
Wassermann anti—syphilis' cam-
paign, 1,784 students took the test
within the period prescribed. Since
that campaign we have given ad-
ditional Vlfassermanns, but the
1,905 students who have already
submitted themselves to Tuber-
culin tests pass the Wassermann
record. '

MOVE TO CATHEDRAL

“It had been our hope not only
to pass the Wassermann test
mark, but also , to go over the
2,000 test barrier. To this end a
room has been granted the men’s

for tests to be given only ‘Wednes-
day of this week. After Wednes-
day no Tuberculin tests will be
offered to the men.”

Beginning at 9 o’clock Wednes-
day morning and lasting until 3
o’clock that afternoon, men’s Tu-
berculin tests will be administer-
ed in the Evening Sessions’
Lounge on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the
Cathedral. ‘

WOMEN’S SCHEDULE

Women’s tests will be offered
all day Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday. V

No more tests will be given after
Wednesday, according-to Dr. Au-
ieene M. Jamison, director‘ of the
vvomerfs student health service.

“This test is different from the

Wasse:mann' examinations,” said:
Dr. Jamison, “because there are’

zlaborate preparations to be .made
vefore the Tuberculins are given.
The serum used must be prepared
fresh" each time it is used, and for
this reason, unless the individual
:ase is exceptional, it is best to
‘ive ’mas-S tests.” ; .- » i
The Tuberculin test, scientiﬁc-
illydeveloped methods of discov-

ering need for X-ray ﬁlms to de-

forward at the Unversity through
the cooperation of=the men’s and‘
women’s student health services,
The Pitt News, Falk Clinic and

burgh.

Falk Clinic, X-ray photos usually
costing from $10 to $15 are be-
ing oﬂered to students reacting
positively for $2. ‘

Severity-eiglit women and 27
men will receive interviews in
response to their applications
for admission to the School of
Education begimiing \Vednes-
day morning at 9 o’clock, Dr.
Charles E. Prall, dean of the

School of Education announced
today
The interviews will continue

through Thursday and Friday, Dr.
Prall stated. Deadline for ﬁling
of applications was March 25.

Courses of the 105 individuals
seeking admission covers the 13
different major fields, a survey
reveals. Commercial majors lead
with 24 students, followed by ele-
mentary and history students,
each with 16; physical education,
13; English, 12, and the chemistry,
French, German, Latin, mathe-
matics, political science, social
science, and Spanish majors with
the remainder of candidates.

PRIVATE INTERVIEVVS

A series of committees, headed
by Dean Prall and Theodore A.
Siedle, assistant dean of the school
of education, will conduct the pri-
vate interviews.

Other faculty members on the
committees include Dr. Percival
W. Hutson, associate professor of
education; Miss Ellen M. Geyer,

professor of English; D; D. Les- ‘V

senberry, associate professor of

education, all of the school of ed-
ucation, and Dr. Samuel H. Wil-
liams, professor of bioloogy.

CHANGE OF PLANS

Although the regular times for
admitting students into the school
of education are November and
April, 22 sophomores, commercial
majors, were “rushed through”
last December in order to avoid a
scarcity of teaching assignments
in their senior year. These soph-
omores therefore will do practice.
teaching in. the first semester of
their final year, rather than the
second semester.

Twenty--four students were al-
lowed entrance in November,
l which 1 brings the total already
“in” this year to 446, with 105 re-
maining to be ,_ examined this
week. i A ’

One hundred and twenty-ﬁve
out of 1445 applicants entered the
school of education last April.

that has previously been understood almost
alone by the participiints, seldom, if ever, by
the stiidents who are not involved in seeking
office.

Geiicml editorial reaction to the €l6ci.l0llS,f0l‘
SFA and Men ‘s Council has been that election-
cering “is fun for those coiicerned.” Beyond
that, the News series has implied, it makes lit-
tle cliﬂference who is and who is not elected.

To the non-coinbataiits, it may seem that the
News policy on student elections, particularly
SFA, is incoiisisteiit. “'9 have argued, first of
311, that the power of SFA should be enlarged
to perinit. 21. raison d’etre for the Assembly. We
have declared, second, that elections are fun,
but are not at all serious.

At present writing, we can accoiiiinodate
both these views, both idealistically and prac-
tically. For the former, we would say that we
are willing to pledge our support, tliat it is
sensible and reasonable that the Assembly have
siifﬁcient powers to justify its existence.

Meiiibers of the present Assembly are anal-
ogous to nie-inbers of the run-of-inine honorary

societies on campus which are pleasant for the,

i'c<-oqiiition of iiicinbcr c;_>‘os, but entirely un-5

suited for ‘dll_\' sort of accoinplishincnt: pleasaiit
but useless. A

On the other hand, taking cogiiizaiice of our
second thesis, we niight say fairly that 0116 Of

mend them than a. pleasing smile and a campus

Professor Lessons

From “A Further Study of the Annoying Habits
of College Professors,” published by Colorado U.,
we find the universal complaints: Habits which
both men and women rated as very annoying were
wise-cracking, talking in a monotone, being con-
ceited, walking around too much, frowning, cocking
head, twisting mouth, not looking at the class, act-
ing too formal, using, slang_ or poor grammar, and
standing in front of the board.”

What's left for the poor prof to do? The Uni-
versity suggests that. all professors with these an-
noying habits refrain from coming to class.

oclastic atti-
tude, of trying,
by ridicule to
tear down the
case for student
government b y
_showing its inability to cope with
pressing problems while it wastes
its time with trivialities.

These two diametrically oppo-
site opinions have a meeting place
at only one point. They both
claim that I have an interest in
the subject. And that’s the only
time they’re right.

It’s Hardly Effective

Summarize it this way: student
is good clean fun. It
doesn’t have nearly so much ef-
fect as you might suppose upon
student government. And as to
who’s elected and what group get’s
which gravy, conﬁdentially, I
don’t give what is colloquially
termed a damn.

After this short interlude, let’s
have a look at the more or less un-
expected developments of the past
week, always remembering to
keep our perspective as to their
relative importance. Relative to
what?, you might ask. And you’d
be right.

Everybody who is directly con-
cerned in the activity, be he poli-
tical boss, or merely stooge, al-
ready knows what I’m going to
say next. This is for the beneﬁt
of other disinterested observers
who are still groping in the dusk.

Most outstanding is the fact that

 

The Rackoft‘

. the threatened split among the 13

rnen’s social fraternities did not
materialize. The boys got togeth-
er and, after a‘bit of ﬁguring, dis-
covered that if they could muster
enough power, there would be
plenty of juicy positions to go,
around. This question of where
to act the extra power was neatly
settled after Les Hamburg, Phi
Ep boss, had dinner with Ernie
Rose, who still knows his way
around Dent school.

‘At The PsiO House

The result was a big Dent—In-
dependent—fraternity caucus at the
Psi Omega house (PsiO is the all-
powerful Dental fraternity) in
which the Independents were rea-
sonable, and agreed to enter the
coalition in exchange for three ex-
ecutive committee seats.

The Independents reconciled
themselves to having a fraternity
man as president, and we’ll pass
along his name in its proper place.

Looking forward. then. it
seems certain that the massive
coalition (Let's call it the Popu-
lar Front) will sweep all but a
few of the more popular Inde-
pendent-Independents off the
face of the map. and cannot pos-
sibly be prevented from obtain-
ing a complete unanimity of the
executive committee for the first
time in SFA‘s history. And
election day this year will be
little more than a farce, with a
few l’e:*-bl-e n-.'>n-aﬂiliates trying
to break the Popular Front slate
fortheir osmi personal satisfac-
tion.

 Approximate Plebiscite

I’ve read about steam-rollers be-
"fore, but you have to cross the
seas to totalitarian Gerrnany or
Russia before you ﬁnd a situation
”.D‘-”‘1‘OXll‘Il7.-lflflg this one. When
Hitler holds a plebiscite, you either
vote “YES” or -else you don’t vote,
which is worse. In Russia, you
are permitted to vote for as many
candidates as there are candidates.

In this coming Popular Front
“contest.” it won’t be quite that
bad. If there were any opposi-
tion, it would be perfectly possi-
ble to have its candidates on the
ballot. But when you realize that
more than 95 per cent of all or-
ganized or half-organized groups
are all running on the same ticket,
fromrnitted to cast their votes for
the some set of candidates, it’s
easy to see the futility of trying to
stop them.

And on top of that. there isn’t
anybody left who WANTS to stop
them.

One thing we can be assured of:
an expression of complete unanim-
ity as to who will provide our stu-
dent government will improve
its efficiency and activity in years
to come.

Go ahead, now, believe that
one!

BASEMENT EXPERIMENT

We thought we were on, the first
ﬂoor, and not until we looked out
of a clean polished window did
we discover that the fourth ﬂoor
is the main ﬂoor. VVanting to
write this article in a scientiﬁc
manner, we began with the first
ﬂoor.

The basement ﬂoor is the sec-
tion for large scale experimenta-
tion. It is almost three stories be-
low ground level on the Dithridge
street side of the building, and
about two stories on the Belleﬁeld
side.

Unit plant companies, such as
the Texas Sulphur company, are
sectioned off by stainless steel
fences, and in these various de-
partments, -machinery and pro-
cesses are developed and applied,
to translate laboratory methods in- i
to commercial productions.

These unit-plants occupy an
L-shaped area two stories high,
covering parts of the south and
east sides of the building.

‘NO ADMITTANCE’

The rest of the basement space
is used for equipment to supply
compressed air, vacuum, hot wa-
ter, refrigerated drinking water,
air—conditioning machinery for
the auditorium, freight elevator
machinery, the main switchboard,
motor generator sets, and the main
plugboard for special currents.

A narrow door opening from a
laundry led to one of the big unit
plants, where two fellows were
busily drilling a spigot into a
large oil can. We walked through
the “No Admittance” sign, and
watched them.

All around us were cans of oil,
poison, sulphur experiments, lab-
oratory closets which contained
spun glass, and myriads of those
chemicals of which we had heard,
but about which we knew noth-
ing. The tall, handsome blond,

By S. S. KALWARY

You’d never believe it, but
Trees Fiel(l—tl1at’s where Dr.|
Sutlierlancl’s slight grid squad
is preparing for the next cam-i
p-aign—is a comparatively quiet
.:ind unchecrful place.

-This is the practice home of
the national football champions;
where an average of one player a
season is whipped into an All-
American player, where the play-
ers are usually'
hustling a n d 3

damentals.

 

Daddio

The abnormally small aggrega-
tion, dispirited, and certainly not
functioning like elevens typical of
Pitt training, has brought on this
sob story. The prospect of a suc- -
cessful 1938 season is not a bright 
one.

Ineligibilities
The situation is this: Coach
Sutherland lost via the diploma‘
mill ten important cogs in last
year’s undefeated Panther club—
Hensley, Micheloson, Matisi, Pat-
rick, Stapulis, Souchak, Delich,
DelleTezze, Adams and Urban.
The release of almost two dozen
varsity ball players, because of
scholastic deﬁciencies, just about
gummed up the spring training
sessions. Musulin and Schmidt,
strongly counted on in the line,
were disqualiﬁed from further
football activity due to the eight-
semester rule. Fullerton and
Etze, hot contenders for the wide
open center post, were slashed
from the team, as was-Farkas, a
potential ﬁrst-string end, and nu-
merous relief ‘
because
their last se-
mester’s grades
were below the
requirements of
the new ath-
letic code.
That these
boys are ineli-
gible cannot be
denied. Their
blue prints
have been care-
fully examined
by The News

men,

 

Goldberg

sports staff, and they have been
found to be lacking the necessary
quality points or passing grades.

?.-

The athletes participating in the
daily workouts do not look up to
par. They are sluggish. Goldberg,
always a willing student, has
learned many fullbacking essen-
tials and he hasn’t lost any of his
remarkable drive, but the extra
poundage he’s carrying has slowed
him up considerably. He isn’t the
same rough and ready back of
last fall.

There is an atmosphere of
“'-.vhat’s the use” up on the hill.
Some of the Panthers, as the boys
in the back room would say, “are
not putting out.” Daddio, Chick-
erneo and Stebbins look okay-—
that’s all. “Dandy Dick” Cassia-
no is a far call from the dandy
lialfback he was last year, and
Lezouski and Petro, a couple of
rugged, racy guards, aren’t up-‘
setting anything but the predic-
tion that Pitt‘s guards would be
even tougher than last season.

Kish and Naric, running in the»

second-string quarterback and l
fullback slots respectively, are I
zilenty smart and aggressive. The

rang‘; Kish should prove to be a
capable understudy for the
“blockin’-fool,” Chickerneo. The
loose-striding Naric will under--
study Goldberg well. Naric’s tack-
iing is his biggest drawback.

Ends In Shape

Hafer, Merkovsky and Konetzky
are all working hard for a tackle
assignment on the Varsity. Cam-
bal and Gryzynski, slashing line-
men, are just beginning to crowd
the aforementioned trio. Hafer is
the most consistent of the quint.

Daddio and Hoffman, veteran
terminals, have their jobs in tow
—for the present——but Dickinson

en. “are doing just what is ex-
pected of top notch ends.

PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA T

Carroll Meets Pitt At Garden
Tonight In First Tee Play-Off

By JAMES J. DAILEY
Pitt’s hockey team meets

|Jol1n Carroll tonight at Du-

quesne Garden in the ﬁrst game
of a. three-game play-off for the
Harris-Sutphin Trophy, em-
blematic of the Championship
of the Ohio-Pennsylvania Col-
legiate league.

To make the attraction three- -

fold, Lois Dworshak, ﬁgure skat-

ing star of the Ice Follies will be
held over to entertain between
periods and the Pitt band will
again go through their formations

l on skates.

TWO GAMES

The trophy will go to the team
winning two games out of three
instead of the team scoring the
most goals as had been originally
planned.

John Carroll tapered off with'

only a few light drills over the
week—end following their conquest
of Western Reserve last Tuesday
night.

The ﬁnal game of the Cleveland
playoff took quite a little out of
the Carrollmen as Western Re-
serve extended things into an
overtime period before Arsenaut
& Co. could come through.

Arsenault scored all of John
Carroll’s goals in the two play-off

l battles including the ﬁnal and de-

cisive marker in the overtime pe-
riod.
HIGH SCORER

Which gives an idea of his rec-
ord. The bounding French-Cana-
dian scored 32 goals during the

Arsenault has never failed to
score at least one goal in every
game his team has played. The
nearest Eddie came to being bot-
tled wasagainst Pitt when Taylor
Brittain watched his every move.

Even in that game he robbed
Pitt of a win by sinking a power-
ful shot from ﬁfteen yards out in
the ﬁnal minutes of play. Pitt
had pushed Carroll into its own
territory consistently during the
game and had tied up Arsenault
until he was satisﬁed to conﬁne.

fense, but the last of the few shots
he took was deadly.

CENTER GOOD

Rancourt, Carrolls be-spec-
spectacled center is less spectacu-
lar but none-the-less dangerous
in his role of “feeder” to the Car-
roll star. Although most of Ar-
senault’s goals have been solo ef-
forts, quite a few of them have
been set up by center Rancourt.

Two-hundred-pound Ryan in
the nets for the Carroll Blue-
Streaks has also had a little to do
with the team’s success. Rated

Pitt Band Skates

At Game Tonight .

Having already taken to the
ice in another one of its pro-
gressive formations, the Pitt
Band will be skating around
Duquesne Garden between the
halves and will make the trip
to Cleveland tomorrow to give
its support to the Panther
hockey team as it plays John
Carroll for the Ohio-Pennsyl-
vania Intercollegiate Hockey
championship this week.

Gaining nationwide recogni-
tion for its gridiron perform-
ances, notable among which
was the rendition of the Big
Apple, the Pitt Band was the
first to take to the ice. The Band
will be led as usual by Mary
“Sonja” Whitney, figure-skat-

SAME TACTICS

Pitt, on the other

showed in the Duquesne play-off

Kappa Sigma defeated Phi

Thursday evening, 53-35, to win
the Interfrat.ernit.y basketball
championship for the fourth
consecutive year.

There was little doubt as to
the outcome of the game as
early as the ﬁrst quarter. Johnny
Michelosen dropped in two suc-
cessive ﬁeld goals in the ﬁrst min-
ute of play to give the Kappa Sigs
a lead, which they didn’t relin-
quish throughout the game.

Don “Luisetti” Hensley topped
the winners scoring with eight two

With Harvey Rooker’s big intra-
mural swimming tourney only a

week away, interest in the meets
has been increasing steadily.

All but two or three of the fra-
ternities have expressed a desire
to enter the tournament, and it is
expected that all the fraternities
will be represented by next Mon-
day. The ﬁnal date for entrance
is Friday, April 8.

Realizing that many of the boys
will be out of" trim, Rooker has
set aside 4 to 5 o’clock on Tues-
day and Thursday for practice pe-
riods. Anyone who has entered
the meet may use the Trees Gym
pool at those times. -

The winner of the fraternity
trophy will be decided on a total
points basis. Five points will be
awarded for each ﬁrst, three
points for each second, and one
point for each third. Boys swim-
ming unattached will be given
gold and silver medals for ﬁrst
and second places, respectively.

Events listed are freestyle and
backstroke dashes, freestyle and
medley relays, and eight dives.
Four of these are required with
an option of any other four dives
the entrant may decide upon.

Track Team Leaves Cramped-Up Field House---
Begins Outdoor Practice

By VVILLIAM MAZEFSKY

\V'it.li a little cooperation
from the weatlierman the Pitt
track team will be able to romp
out into the Stadium today,
lightly clad, and get its ﬁrst
fresh air workout for the long
and tough outdoor season that ’s
lurking just around the first turn
in the Stadium cinderpath.

Past a fairly successful indoor
season, Olson’s cindermen will
work to lose the feel of the boards
and become accustomed to the
more springy turf. The transfer
from the cramped track house
quarters to the somewhat roomy
Stadium will be a popular move
all around.

SOPHS COME THROUGH

In mid-December Ozson called
practice for the indoor track sea-
son worried over the vacancies
that graduation left on his track
squad. A group of sophomores,
however, appeared and scored
enough points in the winter track
meets to make spring prospects
bright.

Sophs Frank Ohl, Al Ferrara,
and Al McKee joined junior
Johnny Woodruff on the mile re-
lay team and by the end of the
indoor season this quartet of
baton welders were the “fairest
in the land” from “Snow White,”
meaning the best). Al McKee
developed into a crack quarter
miler, and Ohl is the best broad
jumper on the squad, and a point
getter in the dashes.

A couple of sophomores will
shot put. Johnny Bazyk already

men in the east. Bud Hafer, a Pete Bennet, high jumper, should

football man, doubles up on track
and ﬂings the shot far enough to
place in most meets.

Captain Dick Mason, who ﬁnds
indoor running not to his liking.
will be the number one man in
the dashes. Captain Edgar han-

reach the ﬁnish of most meets
this year perched in the top spot
of high jump events.

The chief question mark of the
squad will be hurdler Kenny
Ryden. His injured leg muscle
is coming around with such re-

I

luctance that it is doubtful
whether he will be able to com-
pete. Frank Kristl and Ed Routch
help out in the hurdles but Ryden
is the best point getter in this
event. Routch help out
broad jump.

Striding Johnny Woodruff will
again draw most of the spot-light.
Johnny is a recognized threat for
world record in the quarter mile,
holds the world record for
half-mile, and now his name is
being linked with a four minute
mile. Anytime WC-odruff goes to

thepost the possibility of a clip- 

ped record is very deﬁnite.
STRONG SCHEDULE

And from the strongest, the plot .
drifts to the weakest. Olson must 

ﬁnd a javelin tosser, a discus
toss-er, a two-miler, and if Wood-
ruif doesn’t compete in the mile,
a mile;‘. These events are weak
and unless some brawny forms
turn up valuable pointage will be
lost here. And the schedule
through which the trackmen will
have to Wade will not allow for
much loss of pointage.

From the latter part of April
until mid-June the Pitt track team
will be very, very busy. The
schedule includes West Virginia
at Morgantown, April 23; Penn
Relays at Philadelphia, April 29-
30; Quadrangular meet at Evan."-
ton, May 7; Temple at Philadel-
phia, May 14; Penn State at the

10; and NCAA at Minneapo-
lis, June 17 and 18. .

Mike’s four points, Wuertenberg-
