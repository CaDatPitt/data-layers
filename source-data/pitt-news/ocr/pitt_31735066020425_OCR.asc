i- The biggest event this fall at the
Beechwood Farms, a nature reserve
located in Fox Chapel (ten miles

away from downtown Pittsburgh),-

is the fifth annual Applejamm on
Sept.29. Four thousand people,
including some Pittstudents are
expected to take part in the
activities. . * ’ j

The popularity of Beechwood
Farms Pitt students has a long his-
tory. “lt’s a good place to relax, walk
around,” says Rod Rylands, a senior

. biology student. Rod also finds the

library located at the Evans Nature
Center useful when looking for
materials for his biology courses.
Another'Pitt student, George Reese,
is involved in volunteer work there.
- Since 1977 the 90-acre old diary-

farm-turned-nature-reserve has pro-«

vided an opportunity for the people

' herself. See page 7

of Pittsburgh to enjoy nature.
Recently having acquired 32 more
acres of land, the reserve offers a
wide range of habitats: abandoned
ﬁelds being converted to woodlands,
a-conifer plantation, a mature stand
of mixed-oak forest, streams and a
pond. There are also over five miles
of self-guiding trails, as well as spe-
cial walks with the area’s naturalists
to introduce hikers to the wildflow-
ers, herbs, lizards and mammals.
The multitude of activities and
25,000 visitors a year are coordi-
nated by four full-time and two part-
time staff members, who have
college degrees in either outdoor
education, mass communication or
biology. The. director of the reserve,

Fred Rimmel, has an M.S. in forest-'

ry. Inaddition, there are 150 volun-

'teers working at the reserves at

different times of the year; they
include students and housewives
who, after completing naturalist
training, contribute 10‘ hours a
month to take people on hikes, con-

Beechwood‘ Farms is a privately
operated, non-profit educational

institution that recieves no tax
money or governmant aid of any
kind. Not even the National

Audubon Society supports the’

reserve ﬁnancially because it is a
joint project of the Western Pennsyl-
vania Conservancy, which owns the
land, and the Audubon Society of
Western Pennsylvania, which pro-
vides the staff. According to Rim-
mel, the funds come from gift shop
sales, fundraising activities, mem-
berships and private donations.
One fundraising activity will be
the Applejamm. The money raised
will be used to support the educa-
tional programs at Beechwood. This
fall the events include hayrides, cider
pressing, basketweaving, woodcarv-
ing, quilting, and a farm animals dis-
play for children. Also, there will be
scarecrow and pie-baking contests.

Reagan running ahead  

during this election year 

By Mark D. Burd
The Pitt News '

In this election year, most major
polls indicate that there will» be no
moving vans at the White House
next January. In fact, Ronald Rea-
gan seems to be gliding along to a
second term aspresident. But do the
national polls directly reflect the
views of the student‘ body here at
Pitt‘? _

The basis for this poll was to find
out how Pitt students really feel
about the upcoming presidential
election. Students were asked the
following three questions:

I: Who do you think will win the
1984 election?

2: Which of the candidates do you
favor?

3: Why do you favor
candidate?

Approximately three-fourths of
all polled students felt that Reagan
would be reelected. A recent News-
week poll showed Reagan leading by
18 percent; this poll casts the margin
as 16 percent. But why is Ronald
Reagan leading and what do Walter
Mondale’s have to say‘? A

The third question allowed stu-
dents to focus on their candidate and
why they favored him. One Mondale

supporter said, f‘Frankly_, it wasn’t
thaf l’m overjoyed _with‘Mondale,
but 1 just don’t like Reagan." This
was the tone for most all Mondale
supporters. The anti-Reagan vote

that

Think will

win

Reagan / Bush 73%
Mondale / Ferraro 24%
Undecided 3%

accounted for over half of all the
total Democratic support.

Some students, however, did say
some good words about Mr. Mon-

dale in conjunction with his running .
‘mate, Geraldine Ferraro. in fact,

almost 80 percent of the Mondale
supporters said that they liked Ms.
Ferraro and that she is one of the
main reasons for supporting the
Democratic ticket. V

.Overall, however, the Mondale-
Ferraro vantage point looks_ bleak.
The poll showed that 2" nly 39 percent
of those questioned favored them to
defeat Reagan, and there were as
many comments made against the

Democrats’ selection of Ferraro as ‘

were made in her favor.

If the election were being held
today, Pitt students would more

than likely vote for the Reagan-Bush‘ -
ticket. The poll showed that a major- -

ity of students favor Reagan to be
elected to his second term. But what
were their reasons for this decision’?

One student referred to

“TheCarter White House was pretty
much of a disgrace. America was
kicked around more than they ever
were in the past. _I think Reagan
changed that.” Another student
added, “I like Reagan because he
isn't afraid to stick up for America.”
In a similar statement, one student
said,“Reagan doesnft apologize for

the United States, and I admire him“-9’

for that.” In fact, most of Reagan’s
supporters had something _pro-

_ American to say.

Higher LTearning
Than What?

Once again, autumn has des-
cended on the western world. Leaves
turn to bright shades of red and
orange and yellow, L.L.,Bean’s Fall
Catalogue arrives in the mailboxes
of suburbanites all over the country,
and waves of men and women,
young and old alike, flock to col-
leges and universities all agog in
anticipation of that fulfilling fulﬁll-
ment, Higher Learning. I rode to
crest of this wave until early last
week. My Trig UTA undertook the
job of leading my recitation section
to that promised land of Wisdom -—
he was going to show us a new and
exciting method of dividing a poly-
nomial by a binomial: synthetic div-
ision! I listened with bated breath
until he hadfinished his explana-
tion, and I must admit, I was excited
— ljust couldn’t get enough. I was
hooked, and maybe I went too far,
became a little overzealous. I asked
how the method was derived. In my’
naivete I expected the UTA to
respond to the excited energy of liv-
ing minds. Ah, but my UTA was
wise and did not suffer fools gladly;
he said, “Well, I saw the derivation

of it once, but it‘s long and drawn»

out and a pain in the butt. Are there
any other questions?"

Renaissance Two

Pittsburgh is a curious place.
There are so many things to see: Sta-
tion Square, PPGV Place, the
Duquesne Incline, the Three Rivers
Art Festival and the Point, to name
only a few. Yet, with all of these
things to see, there isn’t anything to
do; “What!" you may shout incredu-
lously. “Why, at the Point alone
there must be enough to keep a fam-
ily busy for a day at least.” True,
there are things to do aplenty, but
it‘s against the law to do them. These
are but a few of the wanton crimes
which might be inadvertently com-
mitted at the Point:

0 Stopping on the pedestrian
bridge.

0 Wading in, or in any "way
touching the water under the pedes-
trian bridge. (I'm not kidding. My
girlfriend and I were descended
upon by two armed police officers
when we took off our shoes and
stood in the water.)

My Western Civ. class didn’t des-
cribe the Renaissance quite this way.

- The Pitt News, Monday, September 24, I984

——Newsbriefs——

(UPI) — It’sjust possible that the
November election could leave the
Senate in a 50-50 tie between the
Democrats and the Republicans,

.who now outnumber the the Demo-
crats 55-45.

The last time Democrats and
Republicans were of equal numbers
was in I881, and the result was trou-
blesome for all involved.

Although the Senate’s party bal-
ance has been close on several occa-
sions, only at the beginning of the
47th Congress in 1881 did both par-
ties have exactly equal numbers —
37 senators and two independents.

A special session of the Senate
was convened on March 4 of that
year to deal with cabinet and agency
nominations for the new administra-
tion of President James Garﬁeld.

The Democrats, who had lost
their absolute majority in the 1880
election, thought they had the votes

,of both independents,'but one of
them, Virginia Senator William
Mahone, sided with the Republicans
when it came time for the crucial
vote on committee assignments.

That left the Senate split at 38-38
and meant that Republican Vice
President Chester Arthur would cast
the tie-breaking vote for his party.

LOS ANGELES (UPI) — Only
one General Motors plant is
expected to remain closed by strik-
ing employees today. The company
expects to resume full operations at
the 16 other plants closed by strikes
by the United Auto Workers. Only
the Van Nuys, Calif., assembly plant
is still being picketed. Local 645 in
Van Nuys ignored a return-to-work
order issued by the UAW on Friday
pending settlement of local issues.

WASHINGTON (UPI) —— Two
days before heading to Iowa to cam-
paign in the economically depressed
farm belt, President Reagan
launched a farm debt restructuring
‘effort that could help several thou-
sand farmers stay in business.

He directed the‘ Farmers Home
Administration to defer for ﬁve
years, on a case-by-case basis, up to
25 percent of principal on loans to
farmers without charging interest.

Administration officials said that
that could cost the government as
much as $700 million in lost interest
payments. _

Administration officials declined

~ to specify how many farmers will be

helped, but Frank Naylor, underse-
cretary of agriculture, suggested that
about 20,000 farmers could benefit.

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1984

For the majority of farmers who
borrow from banks and the farmer-
owned Farm Credit System, some
$650 million dollars in federal gua-
rantees will be used to back up exist-
ing loans.

To participate, a bank would have
to write off 10 percent of a farmer’s
loan. Then the government would
guarantee 90 percent of the remain-
ing amount, permitting the bank to
reduce interest rates slightly.

Other parts of the program will
mobilize local financial and man-
agement experts to advise troubled
farmers on restructuring their debts.
In addition, Farmers Home will
contract out to local banks to help
service farm lending.

WASHINGTON (UPI) — Presi-
dent Reagan said U.S. marines will
not be sent back to Beirut to guard
the American embassy, despite last
week’s suicide car-bombing that
killed 24 people. Reagan spoke with
reporters yesterday at a picture-
taking session in New York City,
where he addresses the United
Nations today. The president
rejected suggestions that security at
the/ compound was faulty, noting
that not much can be done if some-
one is. —- in Reagan’s words —
“determined to kill himself."

Four of the Americans injured in
the attack were airlifted yesterday to

an Israeli hospital in suburban Tel .
Aviv. A hospital spokesman said the .

four suffered punctured ear drums
and probably will be released within
a day or so. Eight U.S. citizens hurt
in the blast were ﬂown to West Ger-
many ‘two days ago. One other
remains hospitalized in Beirut.

NEW YORK (UPI) —- An oil‘

industry analyst said the average
overall price of gasoline nationwide
rose more than six-tenths of a penny
per gallon in the past two weeks.
Dan Lundberg said the price of gas

is expected to rise another seven ‘

cents by the end of the year. In his
_bi-weekly survey of retail outlets,
Lundberg showed gasoline at an
average overall price of $1.19 per
gallon.

WASHINGTON (UPI) — State
prisonsare getting more business.
That’s according to a Justice
Department survey of 33 states,
which found the number of crimi-
nals being sent to state prisons
increased by I2 and a half percent in
I981.

early August

If you’re a college football fan, this is not the time to talk
about bigger and greater things to come in Oakland. While the
talkshow callers are having one field day after another, Pitt
head coach Foge Fazio continues to search — as if with his
hands tied behind his back — for the answers. The questions
are numerous but can be grouped very easily. Why aren’t the
Panthers scoring points? a ‘

With only 36 points scored after three dismal games, it is

V indeed perplexing. Especially so since the heart ofthe offense,

Bill Fralic, was, from the start of the season, being touted as a
Heisman Trophy candidate. He heads a‘ truly veteran line
surrounded by talent. The split end and quarterback, Bill Wal-
lace and John Congemi, respectively, returned after an out-
standing season. The backfield, though young, is led bya list of
outstanding talented freshmen recruits. So there they are —
many of the reasons why the Panthers can easily traverse the
goal line. Yet, especially after losing to Temple two days ago, it
is all the more mystifying as to.why Pitt seems trapped in
quicksand.

And because of this worst start in 12 seasons, the rumor mill
has started churning. The object is, of course, Fazio. Though
they are just rumors, the possibility of replacing the third-year
head coach is both unfounded and unfair. An unwritten rule in
both college and pro ranks has it that the quarterback often
receives too much credit and too much blame for his perfor-
mances — or lack thereof — on the field. The same ought to be
applied to head coaches, pro or college.

Venture back two seasons ago when Jackie Sherrill’s sudden
departure thrust Fazio into his first head coaching seat. And
was it hot. He led the Panthers to a 9-3 finish after a season
during which people expected nothing short of an undefeated
season. No matter what Fazio did or said, it was not good
enough. Had he gone undefeated, coaching a team with too
many superstars, then who's to say it wouldn’t have been a
Sherrill championship since all the players were his recruits?
But what we ended up hearing was that Fazio wasn’t ready for
the Division I rigors. A

That was put to rest last season when Pitt ignored 4-7 predic-
tions and finished a respectable 8-3-l after a Fiesta Bowl invita-
tion and a very questionable call in the Penn State game that

. ended in a tie. For once, Fazio could claim he did it with mostly

hand-picked assistants, with his own quarterback and with his
own way of running a team. He even finished his second
recruiting year with outside claims of having one ofthe top five
classes in the nation. He was on his way.

‘Which brings the overall picture to now, when Pitt is 0-3 and '
readying to face heated rival West Virginia this Saturday at
home. The answers do not lie in replacing the head coach.
Instead, the answers lie in loyalty and faith in believing the
worst is behind. Sure, that might sound quite backward, con-
sidering the team’s performance so far. But if that’s so, reason-
ing is no more unsound than that behind Pitt’s sharp nosedive.

If there's going to be a turning point, it's going to be five days
from now in Pitt Stadium in a soldout game against the Moun-
taineers. It is during adversity that one’s true friends emerge.
Fazio has not — and will not — give up the ship. There‘s no
reason why Pitt‘s followers should. -

WPTS for the students

The establishment of a university
radio station on the FM band is a
terrific accomplishment since little
available space exists on the FM dial
and there is intense competition for
this space. Most students surely
applauded the acquisition of this
station and expected the station to
operate as the campus radio station.
Unfortunately for Pitt students and
the generallistening public, WPTS
has chosen to operate as a formated
station. A formated radio station

only plays music which fits a specific

programming format. The disc
jockey has little or no choice ofwhat
music gets played. On free-format
radio, the disc jockey decides what
music to play. . x

A college radio station" has many
purposes. A campus station should
serve as a learning device for stu-
dents who intend to make a career
from radio. But a campus station
also exists to play music which
appeals to the students. Allowing
the disc jockeys to choose what
music they play does not interfere
with learning, it helps. A profes-
sional disc jockey on a commercial

radio station should be experienced
in a wide assortment of music. Stu-
dents also should have the oppor-
tunity to enrich their knowledge
through familiarity with a wide
assortment of music.

No place exists on a college cam-
pus for formated radio. A university
particularly one the size of Pitt, caii
only provide music which appeals to
the entire student body through free-
form radio. No person or groupcan
decide what more than 30,000
potential listeners want to hear.
Many radio stations already fill the
FM band with hit radio, as one of
these commercial stations bills itself.
These stations have a Top-40 format
in order to attract advertising. They
are not aimed specifically at a col-
lege audience.

If WPTS wishes to attract the
campus community as listeners, they
must modify their format to include
a larger cross section of the campus
community. If WPTS does not want
the students as listeners, why bother
to broadcast at all? The ten watts
that WPTS broadcasts with do not
extend to—a wide radius. A large per-
centage of the potential listeners of
WPTS are students.

Only 2 free-form stations cur-
rently broadcast on the FM band, as
opposed to many formated stations.
Another free-form station would
substantially increase the amount of
diversified music being broadcast in
Pittsburgh. Another strictly pop sta-
tion does not provide"much of an
alternative from the other pop sta
tions already on the dial.

WPTS has the duty to play music
which reﬂects the musical tastes of
the entire university. Students at Pitt

0 listen to.a wide variety of music
" ranging from .l.S. Bach to the Sex

Pistols. WPT,S should reﬂect this

variety of tastes through the elimina- '

tion ofa “new music” format and the
installation of a free-format.

Stress. It is something all stu-
dents face. Whether it stems from
problems with classes, exams,

way of life,. stress is a part of all
our lives. To help students handle
these anxieties, the Department
of Health Education, a division
of Student Health Services, is
offering stress management
groups. C

Through the program, stu-
dents will learn how to identify
the symptoms of stress, such as
stomach pains, headaches and
difficulty sleeping and eating, to

niques, time management ideas,

assertiveness and decision mak-’

ing are some of the areas on
which emphasis will be placed. In
the past, individual programs
have proven successful, and now
group sessions are being offered.

The first sessions are Monday,
September 24, from 2-3 p.m., and
Thurs'day, October 4, from 6:30
to 7:30 p.m. The sessions will run
for one hour on a weekly basis for
5 or 6 weeks. More sessions may
be added depending on the
response. The program is free

What is the best way to lure a large
number of male Pitt students into a
fast food restaurant?

A) offer good food at reasonable
prices '
B) cold beer to go

C) a chance to meet and talk with
the reigning Penthouse Pet of the
Month i

If you chose C as the answer, then
you are correct.

Last Friday, Chicken Charlies in
Oakland proved this when 458 grin-
ning male students ﬁled into the
establishment for autographed pic-
tures of the main attraction, Stacy
Cole. g r

The ‘Pitt News. Monday, 'Septeinl;er~2l4, S1984‘

Miss Cole came to Pittsburgh on
Friday on a promotional tour for
Penthouse Magazine. She appeared
at several locations, one of which
was Chicken Charlies in Oakland.

But why Chicken Char-lies?

“These people are more real," she
explained. “These people are my
friends."

This is ironic because, as she
explained, the loss of friendships is
one of the biggest sacrifices a “Pet”
has to be willing to make. She said
that old friends “don't know what to
say to you anymore or how to act."
And ne’w ones, she said, get aggra-
vated by the kind of attention she
receives when she goes out. “Guys
always want to talk to you,"she said,
“and girls like to follow me into the
bathroom. It’s so immature.”

In spite of the sacrifices, Cole said
she has no regrets. “I’ve wanted this

since  was 12 year_s_pld,” she said_

On Vanessa Williams and the
Miss America controversy, Cole
commented, “it's pathetic” —— not

because the pictures were printed or .

that Williams dethroned but that she
didn’t foresee it.

Cole said-that all models who‘
have done nude photographs have '

to accept the fact that they will have

very little control over use of the ’

pictures in publication. According
to Cole, once a release form is
signed, “that's it, forget it." She also
said that she has no sympathy for

Williams and that more nude photo-,

graphs of Williams by a different
photographer would soon appear in
Penthouse.

When asked about her future, she
said, “I don't know what I'm doing
tomorrow.”

Netters suffer 1st loss

By Bob Travers
The Pitt News

Dust off your old Sister Sledge
records. There is a new family in
town. After splitting a two-game
road swing over the weekend, the
Pitt women’s tennis team is playing
“really together now, like a family.”

That’s how Jenny Leach reflected
on the Lady Panthers after returning
from matches against St. Francis
and Bucknell. “This is the closest
team I’ve ever been on,” she said.
“We wereﬂall singing ‘We Are Fam-
ily’ on the way to St. Francis. It
really feels like that on this team; it’s
a good feeling with everybody."

Nobody is doubting the team has
good cause to feel that way. It is 4-1
now, and its only loss has been to
powerhouse Bucknell.

' The weekend started off like the
first two matches have for the Lady
Panthers as they defeated St. Fran-
cis seven matches to two. Saturday
was a different story, though, as
Bucknell shut Pitt out 9-0.

The team took to the road for its
first road trip of the young season
without head coach George Dief-

. . - . , . . .

I

fenbach and No. 1 singles player
Jodi Levine. Dieffenbach was in
Providence coaching the men’s team
in the Big East Championships while
Levine’s academic responsibilities in
pharmacology precluded her hitting
the road.

The pair’s absence was definitely
noticeable, said No. 2 singles player

Rhonda Gibbs. “Jodi’s not being '

there hurt us a lot. Bucknell beat us
last year 9-0 and they have the same

. players. I probably could have won

playing No. 2.”

Leach felt much the same way.
“Jodi’s absence was much more
noticeable against Bucknell than
[against] St. Francis,” she said.
“With her there I know we wouldn‘t
have been shut out. Everybody had
to play up a notch without Jodi, and
that hurt us.”

Gibbs continued battling a cold,
which hampered her Friday play. “I
was too sick to play. I knew I
shouldn’t have gone on the trip, but I
also knew that with Jodi being out I

had to go. I had to be faithful to the
team. Still, I was pleased with the
way I played, considering I was sick.
It was my serve that kept me in the
match on Friday, but on Saturday it
was my serve that gave me trouble.”

Carrie DeVera. who moved from
No. 4 to No. 3 in singles, was satis-
fied with Pitt’s performance. “I
thought I played well at times. My
volley was good. I played better on
Saturday than on Friday, but I lost
then.'But I would still rather play
well and lose, than win and play
poorly.”

So Just how good is Bucknell? A
shutout in collegiate tennis does not
happen every day. “[Buckne11 is] a
very tough team,” "Leach said. “But
we played without our No. 1 player.
Nobody is down about the loss. It
was a good learning experience for
us. It let us see what our weaknesses

are so we know what we have to

improve on.”

All things considered, to comeout
of two road games no worse offthan
losing one match is not that bad.

Next on the agenda for the Lady
Panthers lies Penn State. In a home
match on Trees Courts “The Fam-
ily" faces the Lady Lions tomorrow
afternoon at 3:30. .

“We have two good practices this
week,” said Leach. “If we play like
we’ve been I know we can win. We’ll
just get ready for it and play the best
we can.”

Collier takes some of the blame
for the loss in the second Princeton
match in the semifinals. “I made a
costly substitution error. Changing
the alignment threw the team off.
With experience, we'll be able to
react better.

“This was our first tournament,
and the first time we experienced
that pressure at the end of a tourna-
ment,” he said. “You only get better
in these kinds of playoff conditions
with experience.”

GAME DIGS: Ulana Kohutiak

strength of 59 kills (spikes that are

first match against Princeton, with
only three errors. In that.match,

The Pitt News’

The Pitt soccer team defeated
Bucknell 1-0 Saturday afternoon at
Pitt Stadium to up its record to 2-2.
The Panthers looked good against
the sixth best team in the East. ltwas
a more lively brand of ball displayed
by Pitt than had been the case in
earlier matches.

The game's only goal came with
l5:l8 left in the ﬁrst half. Torn Foley
chipped the ball across the goal-
mouth and junior Rick Burkholder
was there to head the ball in. Burk-

defenders to find himself one on one A R ' V

could get a shot off he found himself ‘ - - .

Dave Van Newkirk, a sophomore S I Q n — u  W I e V a e n D '
forward, found the five as equally‘
adept as Bucknell’s lineup. “Both
teams played skilled soccer,” he said.
Junior Brian Casey, a defender, V  
agreed. “It seems as the program '_ 9

and better recruiting,” he said. . W
“These guys are filling their shoes" ' V _ . i
pretty well. I know at least three 8 W 1.  3 ,

game.” ; .
For the first time this season, Pitt C“ A ' ‘ ' "
showed its fans that,the Panthers _ s       
know how, to work the ball across ' ' S
field and keep control ofthe match. ‘_ _ _ _
 passing and heads reflected ' . Dﬂld fol”    ACIIVIIIBS 
what a week’s worth of practice ‘ '
could do forimprovement.
Said Burkholder, who knocked in
the game-winner, “We had a week
without a game and we needed it.

You couldn’t ask for more from the R V . _ -
players. We played much better than . W A N N l  S E E
we have before." , g -

Said Moss, “This is the first time
 we've beaten Bucknell in a while. We
really came together as a team.”

Casey will admit Saturday’s vic-
tory was the biggest in his three years ‘ F '
as a Panther. “For once the team _ '
defense played great. Everybody - ‘ -
was going for the ball all the time.
We’ve been coming out of the back 
more and creating more opportuni- _
ties for ourselves."

Obviously Luxbacher was pleased W E S N ‘ I  
with the victory. But one could tell ( ;
he definitely had the upcoming _ .
match against Penn State on his
mind Saturday. And who wouldn’t?
The Nittany Lions are currently the
second place team in the East.

Pitt’s most looked-to receiver,
Wallace, finished the day with only
one other catch, a 35-yard scamper.
He is one of only a few on a largely
unproductive Pitt squad.

“We do things on offense, drive
down, and we can’t put points on the
board,” he said. “We run the ball for
20 plays  it just doesn’t seem right’.
Like some imaginary force is hold-
ing us back.”

“Frustrating" only begins to de-
scribe the situation in which the
Panthers find themselves.

“I think we have to open up a little
more,” Wallace continued. “Our
goal was to go with the running
game through most of the first half.
After that, the defense starts to catch
on.

“We have to do something else.
We've got to mix it up. We can't pass
all the time;'we can't run all the time.
We have to put some gadgets in
there to keep the defense on their
toes. I thought Temple played well,
but not well enough to beat us. We
beat ourselves."

because “he's such a quick-hitting

and Temple recovered to eventually

A cross-state trip proved fruitful
for the Pitt women's volleyball team,
which recorded four wins and one
loss in finishing third in a field of

nine teams at the Temple Invita- I

tional this weekend, raising its early
season record to 7-1.

From among the quartet of victo-
ries, one match assumed special sig-
nificance before it was even played;
when the final point was scored,
vengeance had been wrought. Pitt
won its first match 15-12, 15-6, 10-15
and 15-8 over tournament champion
Providence,‘ the team that defeated it
in the Big East championships last
November.

The season is young, but the
promises of learning from past mis-
takes and utilizing the knowledge to
make this a successful season
already seem to be coming true.

“We had many significant
accomplishments at this tourna-
ment." said Pitt coach Shelton Col-
lier. “Number one, we defeated
Providence, who last year kept us
from the NCAA championships. We
had ten months to think about that.”

Senior setter Cathy Rupp, who
was selected to the all-tournament
team, said that it was noproblem
being emotionally prepared for “a
team that stole something from us.
Emotionally, it was already there.
You have to know what it takes fun-
damentally and strategically to win,
which Shelton prepared us for."

*

Collier noted the outstanding play
of senior Pat Belcher in the Provi-

cessful spikes and one spiking error.

A big plus for Pitt was Ulana
Kohutiak’s selection as the tourna-
ment MVP, despite the fact that her
team finished third. “That is a real
tribute to Ulana’s play,” Collier
stated. “It is extremely rare, unless
that player had a much better tour-
nament than anyone on the teams
that finished first and second.”

Collier also said that his team
drove home the point that Pitt could
play without first-team all-Big East
selection Judy Young, the four-year
starter and team captain who is out
with mononucleosis. “We played
well enough to erase some of our
self-doubts.”

Before her illness, Young shared
setting duties with Rupp. “This was
by far Cathy’s strongest tournament
since coming to Pitt. Both Cathy
and Ulana really picked up the slack
for Judy’s absence,” Collier said.

Pitt’s second win came against
runner-up Princeton on Friday
night byiscores of 15-13, 15-7 and
15-4. Rupp explained the easy-
looking win: “We established such a
good feeling, being relaxed and
going out and having a -good time.

“Last year, we weren't sure how to
act as a team,” Rupp continued.
“We had trouble ﬁnding a team
identity and relating to each other
on the court. We got.along fine off
the court, but we didn’t know how to
act on the court. Now, we have
established a team identity.”

Pitt continued its winning ways
Saturday morning . by defeating

,GE]‘-

   

Maryland 15-7, 15-12 and 15-3.
Here, too, it was a case of sweet

of those matches we didn't get up
for,” Rupp said.

Collier agreed, saying that Mary-
land “pinned a costly defeat on us
last year.” It was Pitt’s second loss in
15 games.

Georgetown’s Hoyas were next to
fall to Pitt. After losing the first
game 15-1 1, Pitt came back to take
the match’ with scores of 15-1 1, 15-5

and 15-2. Georgetown is now third .

in the conference, behind Pitt and
Providence.

There the dominance ended as
Princeton came back and defeated
Pitt in the semi-ﬁnals 15-10, 15-9
and 15-10. “It was difﬁcult for us
because we had already beaten
them," Collier remarked. “That
worked in their favor because they
made some adjustments and beat us.

-We had played well in so many big’

matches, and with our small roster,

it was hard to maintain that level of _

play,” he said.

Rupp said that Collier keeps a
positive attitude by emphasizing the
team's accomplishments rather than
concentrating on a failure. “It was a
great weekend, but it was kind of
disappointing the way it ended.
Instead of walking out of the gym
with our heads hanging, we were
encouraged by the good things that
happened,” she stated. ,

“It felt really good for our team to
set a goal and to reach it in the right
way,” she said, referring to the
important win over Providence.

Freshman Charles Gladman turned in a veteran performance against Temple, even though Pitt continued i

Greg Szczepanek/ The Temple News

  

September 24, 1984

By Mark A. Sindler

The Pitt News

PHILADELPHIA -- Charles
Gladman saddled a wooden stool,
head resting on a supportive hand,
looking the part of The Thinker.
This, however, was no pretty sight.
Abrasions on his back could have
been mistaken for tread marks. The
Pitt freshman tailback had just run

for I18 yards on 30 carries and said

in no uncertain terms, “I'm tired,
sore and heartbroken.”

A squad-wide poll would have
revealed a consenus. The Panthers
extended their winless streak to
three games on Saturday by playing
haphazardly against Temple, l3-I2.
At Veterans Stadium, before an esti-
mated 40,000 fans, the Panthers
marched up and down the field
numerousitimes with nowhere to go.

Split it

They converted on only one touch-
down drive and ended two others
with a field goal. '

And there they stand with only 36
points after three games.

“Ask our guys on defense,” head
coach Foge Fazio demanded. “We
pounded them, we pounded them.
That's the story the last three games.
The answers? Keep playing, keep
trying.” '

The defense looked solid against
the Owls, sacking quarterback Lee
Saltz seven times and holding the
ground game to 55 yards. But it was
once again at one crucial point that
the opposition smothered Pitt.

With under four minutes remain-
ing in the game, Temple, down 12-
10, found itself at third-and-l9 from
its 39-yard line when Saltz cranked a
50-yard pass to wideout Willie Mar-
shall. That set up a go-ahead, 21-
yard field goal with 26 seconds
remaining. ‘

   Press Box

“I never saw the ball,” cornerback
Keith Tinsley said. “I was just trying
to catch the receiver -first. I grabbed
his arm and tried taking the l5’=yard
[interference] penalty. He pulled out
of it real good. It was a great catch,
right on the sidelines.”

As if Pitt hadn’t recorded enough
penalties all day. Eight different
times the Panthers were pushed
back for a total of 61 yards. And
that’s not even counting Pitt’s ﬁve
fumbles —— two ofwhich were lost -—
and quarterback John Cummings’
two interceptions.

Still, up 12-l0 with six and a half
minutes to go, the Panthers wasted
their final chance to subdue Temple.
Gladman sprinted for 2| yards from
Pitt’s_ 28, only to watch as Pitt was
given a 13-yard holding penalfy. Pitt
punted two plays later.

Earlier in the third quarter, after
placekicker Mark Brasco shanked a
26-yard ﬁeld goal attempt, the

1/

Panthers undid one drive when
Cummings ‘threw his first intercep-

tion and squandered another when.

the Panthers-lost possession from
their 43 on Craig Heyward’s fumble.
“I thought we did all right in the

second half,” tackle Bill Fralic said. ‘

“We weren’t running many different
things, keeping it simple. But they
adapted. And we kept making mis-
I takes every time. The game could’ve
gone any way in the third quarter.”

Employing a ball-control offense
in the first half, the Panther offense

“ started to come to life; Gladman
compiled 90 yards on 22 carries by
halftime. Two. first-quarter field
goals partiallyatoned for fullback
Darnell Stone’s fumble, which Tem-
ple converted into seven points at
the game’s start. ' .

The Panthers seemed so much on
the rebound that it was difficult to

  Panthers get   Owlful in Temple

connected with split end Bill Wal-
lace for a 14-yard touchdown pass
midway through the second quarter.

That would be Pitt's ﬁnal scoring
against Temple as the Owls stopped
the running game later. Passing
never did emerge as Cummings com-
pleted three of eight for 56 yards.
Freshman Dante Wiley did see
action after the Heyward fumble in
the second half.

“The change in quarterback didn’t
‘hurt us, but when you’re twice given
golden opportunities and don’t take
advantage of those, well, we put
Dante in there to hit the corners,”
Fazio said.

Cummings defended himself, say-

'ing, “lt’s the quarterback who has to

get the points, and when he wins, he_

gets the praise  Everyone’s mea-
sured by winning and losing. I don’t
think I played very well. But I don’t
think I played that bad."
