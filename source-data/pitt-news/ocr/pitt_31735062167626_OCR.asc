 Trustee Meetings Sought Again

A group of concerned students

and faculty, about forty in num- '

ber. was refusedadmittance in-
to the formal meeting of the
Board of Trustees yesterday af-
ternoon.

After occupying the thirty-
sixth floor of the Cathedral of
Learning without recognition,
the group went to the Chancel-
lor’s Suite in Bruce Hall hoping
to meet with a number of trus-
tees equal to a quorum.

When the meeting of the
Board of Trustees ended the trus-
tees failed to appear informally
at the .Chancellor’s Suite, the
group headed for the Chancellor’s
Office.

The group entered the Chan-
ce1lor’s Office with the intentions
of -(1) setting a date, sometime

with two weeks, for an open meet-

ing of the Executive Committee;
(2) obtaining a statement of con-
tracts the University has with
the armed forces and industry;
(3) access to the minutes of in-
vestment policies over the last
five years. The group wanted the
above made publishable to the
Pitt News.

Head of the Board of Trustees
William Ray, Chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar, and Vice-Chancel-
lor Edison Montgomery met
with the group. Thirty-three of
the thirty-four trustees were not
present because they went home,
according to Ray.

The group of concerned stu-
dents and faculty found them-
selves continually compromis-
ing on their objectives. The
discussion changed directions from
a meeting held open to the Uni-
versity with the Executive Com-
mittee to a meeting held open
to the University with ten trus-
tees; to a meeting held open to
as many members of the Univer-
sity that can be seated within
Room 120 in the Commons‘ Fac-
ility Building, with three or

' four trustees. -

The meeting will be held Oc-
tover 29 at 7:00 p.m. Chancel-
lor Posvar and ex-Student Gov-
ernment President Ken Schuel—
er will co-moderate the meet-

' It was a pathetic group of
concerned students and faculty
that met on the Cathedral lawn
Thursday afternoon. The hodge-
podge of dishard revolutionaries
had just returned from the thirty-
 sixth floor of the Cathedral of
" _ Learning where they were refus-
* , led admittance into the formal
"meeting of the Board of Trustees.

The. topic of discussion was
leverage, how to put ears on the
1 heads of the trustees, how to be
 heard. It’s to late now, and it
. T was _too late when the concerned
1”? , students and faculty found them-
‘ selves sitting on the grass out-
-fside the Cathedral instead of on
A ,chairs in the same room with the
I T trustees, but the topic of leverage
--{should have been discussed well
 A , before Thursday afternoon.

The baffled group had just
Q 'cause. “The issues the trustees
 discuss,”. said former Student
 Government President Ken Schue-
” ler, “are relevant to us.” The
_students and faculty should have
’_the opportunity to" understand
'f‘what and how decisions are made,
7 -and the ri_ght to participate in the
9 decision-making process of their
‘university.

way on the thirty-sixth floor, six
floors below the thirty-four trus-
tees. The group was frustrated,
and rightly so.

It would be easy to point--the

finger at the trustees, wage snide
remarks at the reprehensible re-
actionaries, and even gain sup-

port in doing just that. But even.

the majority consensus of the
concerned students points the
blame to the left.

The first mistake was, not
telling anyone.» The organizers.
a rather generous description of
the leaders of the concerned stu-
dents andvfaculty, told very few
of the very few radicals on cam-
pus about what was going to
happen Thursday; Does that make
sense?

The _excuse was that if too
many people knew beforehand,

the police would find out and
stop the movement before it
started. Instead, the leaders
chose to tell only a few, and
in doing so, they stopped the
movement themselves.

The second mistake was not
telling the few participating radi-
cals what to do, or better yet,
not knowing what to do them-
selves. While on the thirty-sixth
floor from approximately fourty-
five minutes before the meeting-
was to begin to minutes after it
started, the thirty plus concerned
students and faculty blocked the

    

Who in their right minds would
expect the trustees to come back
for cocktails and meet in-
formally, knowing a bunch of
hippies were ‘waiting for them?
That’s why the unrecognized
sort of sit-in was a joke.

The discussions soon focused
around what next, what to do
about the two hours of failure.
One suggestion was the one which
seemed the most logical. Pack
up and leave, forget the day ever
happened. Try again in four
months when the next official

‘meeting was to take place.

   
   

hallway (but only partially), the
elevators (the public elevators
and the private one). and the
staircase leading to the top floor.
But that didn’t stop the trustees,
who used the private staircase
and walked the six additional
flights to the meeting room. Why
wasn’t the door leading to the
private staircase blocked?

After the meeting was already
underway, the group went to
the Cathedral lawn to regroup.
They decided on the Chancellor’s
Suite in Bruce Hall, where a
reception for the trustees was sup-
posed to take place after the
meeting. _ ‘

     

Another suggestion was to
stay in the Chancellor’s Suite

until the trustees were ready to

grant an open meeting. If the
group followed that preposter-
ous idea, they’d be dead today.

The group chose to head
for the Chancellor’s Office,
where Chancellor Posvar and head
of the Board of Trustees Wil-
liam Ray finally agreed to stay
and talk. The group outlined
their objectives before re-enter-
ing the Cathedral (see story on
page 1), but what they wanted
and what they got. were two dif-
ferent stories. In fact, what they
got wasn’t much more than what

‘ they had before the Thursday

circus. ,

“I’m not afraid of an open
meeting,” insisted Ray, probably
not believing what he said. “I’ve

had far worse meetings as presi- .

dent of a school board than al-
most anything you fellas can
dream up.”

Ray explained, however, that
an open meeting was not the an-
swer. He suggested a small com-
mittee be set-up with the Presi-

A dent of Student Government Scott

Baum representing the students.

“We’re asking for a meet-
ing not with one or two represen-
tatives,” -replied Schueler, “but
a meeting open to the whole
University.’ ’

But talking to Bay was like
talking to the wall behind him,
or better yet, like talking to the
thirty-three trustees who weren’t
there. “We came here trying to
create options,” said Josh Chasen,
who kept explaining to Ray how
the group was concerned’ with
the University, and how they have

attemptedto create change through

non-violent means.

Ray wouldn’t listen; neither
would Chancellor Posvar, nor
Vice—Chancellor Montgomery,
nor the thirty-three missing trus-
tees who never listen simply be-
cause they are never there.

The
with the trustees, and that’s ob-
viously the way they want it, is
where the men with the power
failed Thursday, too. Their fail-
ure makes one ask if the —group
would have been successful had
they been organized. The group
of concerned students and faculty
were forced to give in five times,
and end the frustrating discus-
sion in the Chancellor’s Office
with not much more leverage than
they had" before the Board of
Trustees meeting.

willhe R1111-Around

Concerned students and faculty are back in
action. Although many of them have been
working behind the scenes during the first
weeks of the term, Thursday’s attempt to open
up the meeting of the University Board of
Trustees was their first overt action this fall.

\ The return of the concerned group came at a

time when many had forgotten they ever
existed. Many students, faculty and

administrators had become content with the

snail-paced liberalization of the College of Arts
and Sciences, and had all but forgotten the
action of the concerned group last year.

But the subject of open trustee meetings is .

not new either here at the University nor at

--other universities across the nation. Many

confrontations, .both peaceful and violent, have

.occured over this subject in the past years.

Last years occupation of the Common

‘ Facilities buildingpwas largely linked to the

fact that students were attending a “closed”
University.

Thursday’s events may, however, be a sign
of things to come. Afterthe attempt to address
the trustees during their meeting to discuss
opening future meetings failed, the group
waitedin Bruce Hall to meet with the trustees
informally at a reception planned for after
their meeting. This reception was never held

. (at least in Bruce Hall), for the Chancellor

invited the group to his office to discuss their
proposals with William Ray, head of the Board
of -Trustees, while the other trustees went
home. '

y‘Parts ofthis two hour discussionnindicated
many of the problems facing the University:

1. Mr. Ray’s first few statements indicated

that the trustees would not act as a result of ‘

any demands made by students.

2. The Chancellor and his fellow,
administrators felt there was not that much,
— important business ‘conducted .at_ V -trustee 

meetings and could see no reason to open them
to the entire University. a

  bed autumn, let it wntin

 

   
    
      

 

  

_1,'QW9rfd,er w.ha;t5f7Iv‘_.vti11«,b.e_nem_ernbering_in-
" A G '‘ ’'.etii'ldrenr.''

3. The concerned students and faculty gave
in five times to finally accept a meeting to
discuss a meeting to discuss open trustee
meetings.

If those three sound confusing, it aptly
reflects not only the tone of the discussions
with Chancellor Posvar and Mr. Ray, but the
tone of the entire bureaucracy under which this
University functions.‘ Much of the do'uble—talk
of Thursday’s meeting resembled that which
was heard during meetings about the Pitt News
financial problems, the Black Studies proposals
last summer, and almost every other dis-
cussion of this nature in the past two years.

The administration and the trustees claim
that the powerilies with the faculty, -yet" no
major decisions can be made without the
approval of these supposedly “powerless”
decision makers‘.

One statement which typified the entire
meeting was one Mr. Ray made about the
progressthe trustees were making in opening
their meetings; as they were asked to last
winter. He-noted that there were three student

’ observers at the meeting, and that one of them,
Scott Baum, Student Government president,-

was a very capable voice for the student body.
He then went on to add that Baum wasn’t

allowed ‘to speak at the meeting, he was just

there to observe. ~
So what the students reallylneed is’ a good

student ear, not a good voice. But Mr. Ray’ also .

expressed his. opinion _that_ ‘these observers
were a giant step ‘inopening trustee meetings
to the public. Giant to you, Mr. Ray, but
backward to those of us who feel you and the

Chancellor and the rest of the administration A

are hiding behind the bureaucratic process and
fending off those who desire to know-about what
is going on , here at
tokenism.

The question-;is:' How, much lflongerl» will».

people _be con_tent with your bureaucratic
bullshit? *'Aren’t you forcing peaceful people

Discusses Policy _

Scott Opposes Intervention; Attacks China

by BILL GORMLEY
Staff Writer

Senate Minority Leader Hugh-
Scott believes that it would be a‘

mistake for American troops to
ever fight again on the ground in
Asia. Speaking at a University
sponsored China symposium on
Oct. 17, the Philadelphia Re-
publican declared, “Having learn-
ed from Korea and Vietnam. we
should serve notice that we will
never again engage in a land war
on the mainland of an Asian,coun-
try.”

Elaborating on his position,
Pennsylvania’s senior senator ar-
gued that if, for example. North
Korean soldiers should invade
South Korea, the United States
ought to refrain from sending
ground, forces‘ to aid the South
Koreans-. However, he did coun-
tenance the possibility of “mas-
sive air or sea support.”

Prior to entering“Stephen Fos-
ter Memorial, where the panel dis-

‘ cussion took place, the mustach-
ioed politician was greeted by a‘

contingent of anti—war demon-
strators, chanting “Scott must

. go” forhis benefit. With little dif- '

ficulty, Scott waded through the

ring of protestors, shaking hands

and exchanging’pleasantries.‘ Be-

- , ‘fore going into the auditorium, the

pipe-smoking Repub‘lican flahsed

Although Scott devoted most of
his attention inside to Sino-Ameri-
can relations, he found it impos-
sible not to make a least a few
comments on the war in Viet-
nam. “I think we should get out of
this war as fast as we can,” the
congressional leader remarked.

Later qualifying that statement,
Scott emphasized the need to
“protect the indigenous polula—

' That’s all you can call it.

tion from massacre” in the wake
of an American withdrawal. "1
advocate that we get out." he ex-
plained. “but so precipitously as
to expose without warrant the
forces of South Vietnam."

The Capitol Hill veteran, invok-
ing the principle of “self deter-
mination for the people of South
Vietnam.” expressed his willing-
ness to abide by the results of free
elections in the country. even if
communists emerged as the vic-
tors. "I would not welcome a pre-
dominantly or totally communist
government." he allowed, "but I
would accept it if it were freely
chosen by the people.”

Alluding to the Vietnam Mora-

I torium, the GOP chieftain char-

acterized last week’s protestors
as “gentle people of mostly good
will.” Notably, Scott refused to
oppose the Moratorium after its
occurrence, observing instead
that “the right of dissent is to be
honored.” However, he chided the
demonstrators obliquely with the
remark that he wished he had
seen at least one “protest sign
against Hanoi.”

The self-described moderate
called for a balanced’ view__ of
America's government, arguing
that-the Un'ited~States has acted

both rightly and wrongly in the

past. “I do not say that all the

things our country does are hon-_
’ orable,” he emphasized, “but I do

not welcome the sarcasm of those
who say that everything we do is
stupid.”

Denouncing “the charge that
everybody hates the United States
because all the things we. do are
wrong,” Scott declared, “I do not
believe that my government is re-
sponsible for all the‘ ills of the
world.” He added that “if we have
made mistakes, then we should

use them as guideposts to the fu-
ture."

Shifting the discussion, Scott ac-
cused the Chinese People’s Re-
public of being responsible for the
virtual non-existence of Sino-
American contacts. “The main-

land of China,” he avowed, “is not
showing the same interest in open-
ing windows into China that the
United States has indicated.”

    

SENATOR HUGH SCOTT
While the Pennsylvania Repub-

licanconceded that a notePr"esi-I

dent Nixon sent the Chinese in
January was "on the hard side."
he applauded the steps Nixon has
taken since that time. Scott cited

-,a minor trade agreement and the

expression of *America‘s “willing-

ness to exchange students. journa-7

lists and congressmen with the
Chinese" as examples. '
Vigorously defending such ges-
tures as preludes to major ac-
cords. he recalled that "before.
there were no gestures." Also, he
reminded his audience of Presi-
dent Kennedy’s maxim, “A jour-

ney of a thousand miles must be- ‘

gin with a single step.”,Scot.t
agreed that gestures “are not
enough” but he contended that
-they “are a beginning.”

When asked whether the Nixon
administration would actively op-
pose the admission of the People’s
Republic of China into the United
Nations, the one-time Republican
national chairman predicted, “We
will continue to oppose the admis-
sion of Red China until Red China
makes peace with the UN.” Scott
was referring to the lack of-a Ko-

rean peace treaty.

Turning to the Sino-Soviet dis-
pute, the 68-year-old political vet-
eran rejected the notion of an
American alliance with one side
or the other. “As surely as we
take the side of one,” he prophesi-

ed, “we will pay in decades to

Scott added that “it is. highly dan-'
gerous for two nuclear powers to‘
align themselves up against" aj

Birefly describing the Nixon _
administration’s policy on this
matter, Scott declared that the A

"Do It Now”

by MARCH HILLER, Chairman
Forum on Drugs Committee

“The ax that Paul Krassner is
clutching is a put-on because he
really doesn’t have a hostile bone
in his body. Yet for the last 10
years, Krassner has been wack-
ing away at society’s sacred cows:
motherhood, the Pope. sexual
mores, the flag, (and himself) —
with corrosive, outrageous hu-
mor. As editor and founder of the
Realist, a pulpy, almost-monthly
magazine which the cover labels
as the “Magazine of, the Luantic
Fringe” or “of Angry Pen Pals"
or "the Fire Hydrant of the Un-
derdog,” Krassner is the precu-
sor and perhaps dean of the un-
dergroundpress.” -

Chinese Relations Seen

by CINDY MORGAN
Staff Writer

1: Preceding Senator Hugh Scott
on Oct. 17 at the symposium “The

' United States and China 20 Years

After” at Stephen Foster Memori-
al auditorium -were three speak-
ers. They were: Paul Kreisberg,
an interpreter at the Sino-United
States Warsaw talks; Dr. Jerome

Cohen, professor at Harvard Law

School; and Dr. Robert Newman,
University of Pittsburgh Speech
and Theater Arts professor.
Thursday’s symposium was the
third in a series which built on a

- foundation of US policy toward

China, which involved the topic of
the recognition of Communist Chi-
na in the United Nations.

Mr. Kreisberg opened the talks
with opinion of present Chinese
relations. “We should convince
the Chinese to move toward more
normal relations in such areas as
"trade, newspaper exchange, and
assemblies. They have not re-
sponded, and even broke off their
limited contact and reduced fre-
quency of meetings. At this point,-
where do you go from here? It
takes two. to move toward recon-
ciliation.”

Mr. Cohen then spoke on the
role of intérnational law in US-
China affairs. His background in-
cludes education at Yale, clerk to
Justice Earl Warren, and consul
in the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. Presently he is di-
rector of the Legal Studies Pro-
ject at Harvard. Cohen expressed
‘his opinion on the importance of

various aspects of international
law such as how consuls should
be treated. The main topic includ-
ed the question of "overcoming
the legacy of mistrust since '49.”
and which has “been there ever
since." and also mentioned the
“crux of the issue” was "the legal
status of Taiwan."

Then Dr. Newman outlined the
sources of support concerning
various myths of China policy in
the United States. The first of
these involved the myth that we

sense. “As a matter of fact,” he
continued, “we never had it.” He
also listed that many believe "we
shouI.' support Nationalist China
as a ‘t‘riendly” regime but added
that he believed there is “no case
to be made whatsoever for Chiang
Kai-S_hek.” He then continued to
denounce ‘Chiang as “Saviour of
the Orient,” and Lady Chiang as
“Joan of Arc.” Newman then
questioned the position of Chiang
as an old ally and suggested a
reading of China‘s Destiny to “de-
termine just what kind of ally he
was.” -

Then following a speech by Sen-
ator Scott. a brief question and
answer session was held to enter-
tain questions by the audience on
topics related to various positions
of the United States and China, but
the audience also saw fit to draw
in topics involving Southeast Asia
and last week‘s Vietnam Mora-
torium.

 

1968 Chicago Democratic Conven- _

tion.

Atop all this, Krassner is com-
ing to Pitt to speak out on Drugs!
His views may prove offensive to
a few, but he will definitely tell it
like he sees it. His method of at-
tack is unknown (even to the Drug
Committee), but his views as to
whether drugs will spoil the sys-
tem should be one worth remem-
bering. He will tell us to do it now
—whether we do or do not—don’t
wait. This philosophy of his has
been expressed many times be-
fore, as in the Life interview:

“If I had one thing to tell every-
body, it would be: do it now. Take
up music, read a book, proposi-
tion a girl—but do it now. We know
we ‘are sentenced to death. People
cannot become prisoners of guilts
and fears. They should cling ‘to
each moment and take what en-
joyment they can from it.” In

-other words, he says for anyone

who wants to smoke . . . go ahead
and do so, but do it now.

  6---Krassner

But one must take the danger
factor into consideration. Possi-
bly a strong youth movement
which would provide the necessary
pressure to repeal the Harrison
Act of 1914 (which is well anti-
quated) and to make a clear def-
inition between grass and hard-
er drugs. Why should possession
of grass result in a felony (2-15
years imprisonment plus $2,000-
$20,000 -fine) when LSD’s posses-

sion is only considered a misde-. »

meanor resulting in no more than
one year in jail? ? ?

When asked for a final remark
for the press before he comes to
Pitt, Paul told me: “In a demo-
cracy people have the right to
choose the way they want to go to
heaven or hell as long as they
don’t make anyone else go on their
trip.” Surely, Krassner’s visit
will be most interesting; come

Five University faculty mem-
bers have helped'to organize a
Pittsxurgh group to aid New York
Mayor John Lindsay in his fight
for re-election. The professors
supporting Lindsay’s effort are
Mary Benson, Graduate
School ..,,of. Public Health; David
Bramhalli of the Economics De-
partment; Atty. Thomas Cooley,
II, of the Law School; Joseph Mc-
Lean and Jon Robison, both of the
Graduate School of Public and In-
ternational Affairs.

Organized under the name “Ur-
ban Surivival,” the groupis ‘rais-
ing funds and may send volunteer
campaign workers to New York.

The group stated, “We believe
Mayor John Lindsay has provided
vital national leadership to the
struggle to build cities in which
human beings and human values
can survive.

“Under Mayor Lindsay’s lead-
ership,” the statement added,

“New York has taken action for

decentralization of New York’s
vast school system, 11 new sub-
way lines, and development of a
15,000 _unit residential and com-
merical complex to be evenly di-
vided among upper, middle, and
lower income residents.

“Under Mayor Lindsay’s lead-
ership.” it continued, “New York
has been exceptionally free of the
violence that has racked Los An-
geles, Detroit, Newark, Washing-
ton, Chicago, and so many other
American cities.” '

The group called Lindsay “a na—'

tional symbol of determination to
cope with our supposedly ‘ungov—
ernable’ cities in a year when
other distinguished mayors have
retired rather than return to frus-
trating conflict.”

1 The New York mayor was cited
for having spoken out ever since
his election in 1965 against the
war in Vietnam and for “concen-
trating our national resources on
our critical social problems.”

Resistance on Campus

Anti-Draft Group Formed

by CINDY MORGAN
Staff Writer

A group of interested Universi-
ty students affiliated with the
Pittsburgh Draft Resistance feel
the draft resistance here on cam-
pus could use a broader base, and
that the University community
would profit from a campus-xa's
ed operation. And so a new face
has appeared on campus: the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Draft Resis-
tance.

The basic purpose of the organ-
ization is “to encourage resis-
tance toward war and military
service,” according to the found-
ers. They hope to accomplish this
by being a center for draft and
war information.

Michael Kosloff, junior sociolo-
gy major with a strong interest in
black studies and founder of the
organization, pointed out that this
group is “the only place where one
can get draft counseling on cam-
pus. It can provide information on
every alternative, from tradi-
tional deferments to resistance

and emigration. We will even give _A

the Blue and Gold, 26-22.

Ironically. the wild finish start-
ed off with a Panther break. The
Wave had marched to the one
yard line after stopping the Cats
on their own 47. But Rusty Lecha-
usee, the Tulane quarterback.
fumbled into the arms of Dave

Dibbley.

 

   

The good fortune was short-
lived, however, as Denny Ferris
fumbled three plays later and the
Wave once again had a first-and-
goal situation, this time on the
Panther five-yard line. And a cou-
ple plays later. Tulane’s other
quarterback, Dave Abercrombie,
hurdled over right guard for a
touchdown that brought the Wave

to within two points of the Jungle
Cats.

After the ensuing kick-off, the
Panthers failed to control the ball
and Lachausee put his arm into
action. He fired a 34-yard pass to
Steve Barrios, moving the Wave
into the Cat end of the field. Then,
the big blow to Coach Carl DePas-
qua’s gridders came on a 32-
yard heave from Lachausee to
Maxie LeBlanc for Tulane’s game
winning TD with only 43 seconds
on the clock.

John Friedl made a worthy at-
tempt to regain the lead for the
Panthers, but could get the team
no farther than the Wave’s 32-
yard line. ‘

Unable to come up with the big play when it was needed, the
Panther Cubs bowed to the Little Mountaineers of West Virginia,
21-10, intheir debut Friday. Though brilliant in spots, the Cubs

were unable to cash in on frequent
West Virginia miscues, and their
failure in‘ the clutch cost Coach
Bill Quinter’s squad the victory.

, No less than seven Panther of-
fensive thrusts ended on the visit-
or’s side of the midfield stripe, but
only twice could the Cubs score.
The first three Panther markers
came via the talented toe of Tim

.Hornish, who split the uprights"

with a 27 yard field goal. The
lone Cub touchdown occurred af-

ter the outcome was decided. late .

Friedl threw seven times in the
final seconds. but his second aeri-
al in the series was the most im-
portant. Tulane Safety Paul Ellis
intercepted the toss. However.
the interception didn’t count be-
cause of a pass interference pen-
alty. The damage was there.
though, because Ellis managed to
elude several Panthers after
stealing the pass. and he ate up
valuable seconds on the clock.

“We let it get away from us,”
DePasqua said. “We gave up the
ball too freely.» They started to
turn the game around and let it
slip away.

"We did a heluva job offensive-
ly, but in the critical situations we
didn’t come up with any of the big
plays. There‘s no question about
that.”

‘Tulane’s coach Jim Pittman
agreed, but he certainly wasn’t
going to deny the pleasure he re-
ceived via the triumph. .

“Pitt did a great job,” he said. A

“But any time you come from 20
points down it’s a great win. The
kids came back against a fine Pitt
football team. They wanted to
win this one.”

There weren’t many people in
the Stadium who would have ex-
pected a Tulane victory after view-
ing the first half. The Panthers
completely outplayed the Wave
and went into the locker room
with a 22-8 lead.

Friedl connected with George
Medich for the Panthers’ scores
in the first quarter. Both of those
TDs were set up by Tulane fum-
bles.

John Stevens crossed the goal
line for the first time as a Panther
for the gridders’ final touchdown.
Ken Sanders,the nation’s leading
punter, juggled a bad snap and
rushed a poor kick that landed in
the arms of Stevens. The Panther
tackle then chugged 42 yards with
a half dozen blockers ahead of
him.

A kicking play also went awry
for the Cats.

The gridders had a fourth down.

to fumbles. The three-pointer by
Hornish successfully ended a
fifth Panther bogged-down offen-

at the half.

That was as close as they were
tovet. After the intermission, the
Panthers c_ouldn’t budge the
Mountaineer defense. Looking for
the run, West Virginia forced Ho-
gan and reserve quarterback Has-
bach to take to the air.

The loss was particularly rough
on the Panther defensive team.
That unit has been‘p‘laying spark-

seemed to be no exception.

Besides holding the Wave rush-

the defense also chased Lachau-

zone for a safety in the second  

quarter.
