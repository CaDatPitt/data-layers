Conservatives Fail to Masturbate

by PEGGY ALLEN
Staff Sweetheart

Dr. A. R. Gassim spoke this
week at the Sex and Sexuality

. Symposium on the topic, “Sex and

the College Radical.” “Opposi-
tion to authority and the estab-
lishment,” stated Dr. Gassim, f‘is
one sign of a well-adjusted and
satisfied sex life. Students who re-
bel and work for change have us-
ually placed sex in its proper per-

  
 

spective. It is only those people
who are able to throw off the
chains of traditional moral and
religious standards who are able
to enjoy sex.”

Dr. Gassim went on to explain
to a crowd of over 200 heterogen-
eous students that the more con-
servative students, such as engi-
neers, ROTC members, and phar-
macy students, often suffer from
dee sexua; frustration “And un-

fortunately,” he added, “they’re
too hung-up with the establish-
ment’ to masturbate.”

The conservative students us-
ually views the university as a
parent symbol, explained Dr.
Gassim. Since he cannot even tol-
erate the thought of pre-marital
sex, his sexual fantasies usually
focus around the Mother Univer-
sity (or with a girl, the Father
University). Any violation of the

_. traditional customs of the Univer-
" sity becomes. to the conservative

student, a rape of the mother.

“You saw how upset the con-
servative students become when
the Concerned Students sat in the

- Common Facilities Building. This
round building obviously repre-

sents the female, or mother fig-
ure,” he explained. “The Free

_ University represented to them a
_ violation of their mother.”

’Dr. Gassim then gave many

other examples’ of this sexual mal-

adjustment found in many Pitt
"The ROTC were ob-

loss of rifles was to them the
cruelest form of castration."

Dr. Gassim warned. however.

‘about one very eminent danger

acing the radicals. "Most radi-
als are well informed and exper-
enced in_the use’ of contracep-
ives, while conservatives are not.

HERSHEY RESIGNS
Gneral Lewis Hershey announced today that he will resign as di-
rector of the Selective Service Bureau. Hershey‘s resignation was ac-
companied by an announcement that as of this April graduate students
will no longer be drafted.

PARKING METERS
This summer. all the parking meters in Oakland will be changed
to four hours. according to the Public Safety Commission. In addi-
tion, metermaids will no longer give tickets between the hours of ten
and ten after each hour so that University students will have time to
get to their parking meters between classes. '

LEGISLATURE CHANGES POLICY

Reliable sources in Ha_rrisburg said-that the legislature is consi-
dering a bill to leave the Universities alone. Sources reveal that the
bill would include provisions guaranteeing all students the right to
attend a University, regardless of their beliefs. Also included was a
clause to make illegal the utterance "If they don’t like it there, why
don't they go somewhere else?“

LIGH:I‘S TO BE INSTALLED-

Lights will be installed in the Commons Room so that students
will be able to see.

STUDY REVEALS CIGARETTES ARE NOT HARMFUL

A recent study reveals that previous studies were erroneous in
their conclusion that cigarettes cause lung cancer and related diseases.
The study conclusively shows that cigarettes are not harmful to the
health. . '

WAR IS OVER .

President Eugene McCarthy announced today that the war is of-
ficially over. »
GALLUP POLL

A recent Gallup Poll showed that the majority of Americans have
sympathy for college students today, and support their efforts to
change the world. The poll reveals that adults realize that going to

college isn't just fun and games, and that most protests are generated
by sincere concern for needed reform.

. NEW DORMITORIES located at the present site of Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial. The dorms will be co-educational and will be equipped with
sauna bath, heated pool, air conditioning, private baths, double beds and
other necessities of life. The new rooms will be larger than telephone

booths, and will have provisions for complete privacy.

ception is only five per cent while
the rate of conservative concep-
tion is 45 per cent. If this trend
continues, the U.S. will soon be
filled with conservatives."

 

 

 

 

it ‘Grass’ Not Addictive -

Marijuana Tax Act Repealed

By overwhelming agreement,
the U. S. Senate and House of
Representatives voted to rescind

 the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937,

thereby legalizing marijuana.

Congress based its decision on
a recent White House Commis-
,sion on Narcotics and several
other studies undertaken in the
last 20 years, including Mayor La
Guardia’s Commission on Mari-
juana, a highly respected and
comprehensive study which clear-
ed grass of many of the mytho-
logical indictments against it.

Myslinski Announces Stadim Renovation

. _ by U. R. DREEMING '
Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski outlined details for

complete renovation of the athletic facilities at the University
in a surprise press conference yesterday afternoon at the Field

House.

Highlighting the plans for improving the physical plant of
"the athletic department was the erection of a dome over Pitt

,"7__Stadium. “We have negotiated
’.'. V: with architects who have drawn

up feasible plans for doming the
stadium,” Myslinski explained,
“-and we hope to have it ready

. A’ for the home opener with Navy

Oct. 11. We’ll begin construction

" .. _as soon as spring drills are over.”

Along with plans for the dome,
the stadium will also be decked
out with Tartan turf and a flash-
ing scoreboard similar to the one
in Houston’s Astrodome. “When
we score‘~a touchdown,” Myslin-
ski added, “a blue and gold pan-
therwill flash on the board and
explode with a growl. This is

.. really going to be the year the

Panther begins to growl.”
All seats in the stadium will be

V painted iridescent blue and gold

and the labor will be furnished
by volunteer women students mo-

Football coach Carl DePas-

" qua made a surprising an-
nouncement at the Pitt Stadi-

~ um yesterday prior to the grid

. practice scrimmage.

Actually, the announcement
didn’t seem too startling at first.
The coach told reporters that he
had lined up a new recruit, Jim

. Pedus, a six-foot, five-inch, 267-
pound place kicker from Tohnaile
High School, the Foothills Con-

A ference, Honolulu, Hawaii.

The big news is what Pedus
will bring with him when he ar-
rives next September. He will be

, accompanied by‘ what the Ha-,
waiians have billed as “the most
beautiful foot in the world.” The
five toes on that foot have already
made gridiron history on the is-

lands.

His toes have made Pedus the
idol of all the Hawaiian beach
combers, by virtue of the records
he has set at Toh-High. During

- his three years at the high school
Pedus averaged 60-yards per punt
in leading a field-position type of
team to a 29-0 mark. Whenever
his coach, By Sole, felt like trying
something different Pedus would
try field goals. He couldn't av-
erage more than 52- yards per

three-point kick, though.

DePasqua said, “Jimmy’ll rev-
olutionize Panther football. He’s
sure to nail down a national cham-
pionship for us. Nobody will con-
sider us patsies any more. 'We’ll
just go out and play footsie with

them.”

The coach also hinted that Pe-
dus would like to try his foot at

SOCCEI‘.

“A friend of his told him that
soccer is good for the feet, and he
would really like to see what he
can do,” DePasqua noted. “I told
him that the seasons slightly over-

lap, but Jimmy insisted.”

“He said he’d concentrate
mainly on football and play soc-
cer when there wasn’t a football‘
game at the same time,” DePas-

qua added. '

The only thing that seemed to
,worry DePasqua was the differ-
ence in thetclimate. The Panthers -

bilized by the Associated Women
Students. The outside of the sta-
dium will also be painted, if the
girls have time. New press box
and chancellor's box facilities,
complete with bar, closed circuit

.television, and dining room will

also be installed.

In addition to the renovation
of the stadium, Myslinski also
outlined new use for- the Field
House. “Since all the basketball
games will be played under the
dome in the stadium from now
on, the Field House will be turn-
ed over completely for track and
wrestling. With the growing in-
terest in these sports it is in their
interest to give them the needed
facilities.”

All locker room and office ‘fa-
cilities in the Field House will

JlM PEDUS
From Toh to Head Panther

“Jimmy should be able to ad-
just,” the coach said. “It’s the
foot I’m worrying about. A. little

‘bit of coldness could cause frost-

bite. We may make him walk
around campus with ice packed
on his foot to help it adust.”

How would Pedus feel about
that?

“I really couldn’t anwer that,”
DePasqua said. “Nobody knows
anything about Jimmy. His foot
has gotten all the publicity.
I don’t even know what he looks
like. I don’t really care.”

NO one really noticed before
ttbat statement, but there was
something strange going on at the
practice. All of the footballers
had somehow lost their shoes.

“It’s nothing as serious as that,”
DePasqua said. “We’re just plan-
ning a big welcoming for Jimmy.
He doesn’t like to be noticed,
that’s why we don’t have any
good pictures of him. If know-
one else wears shoes he will be
able to relax a bit more. He won’t
think everybody’s looking at him.”

Panther followers can certain-
ly expect football to be revolu-
tionized. When a team gets ready
to play the Panthers they’ll know
what to expect. The opponents’
only defense will be the Right

Gu_ard, the«‘Com_mand,' and the.

WISE MAN TROPHY
The Wise Man Trophy,

awarded annually to the indi-
vidual who most displayed sag-
acity in his interactions at the
University, was promised to
University of Arizona head,
football coach Frank Kush.

Kush, who owns the fifth
best winning percentage in the
college football ranks, had
planned to leave his post at the
University of Arizona and take
on the vacant post left at the
University.

In his final decision, Kush
changed his mind, broke an
agreement to coach at Pitt and
remained securely at Arizona.
That decision is considered by
the Pitt News as the wisest,
most sagacious decision made
by an individual this year.

ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT officials supervise as the new dome arrives
just in time for spring renovation of the stadium. The dome will be the
Iidlifter in a series of plans designed to improve the University athletic

ets may also be used.

“This should keep us busy for
a while,” continued Myslinski.
“These are strictly short run plans
and we’re still debating over what
to plan for throughout the next
ten years. We may level the en-
tire hill and start from scratch

In a final note, Mr. Myslinski
explaned that the entire project
would be funded by a state ap-
propriation, but he didn’t identi-
fy which state.

conference history, no questions
were asked. The reporters just

Coach Ridl

Undecided

by I. WYNN

Basketball coach Buzz" Ridl is a very confused; man this
week. Not only does Ridl have to_worry about the_v1c1ous» battle
for the sports dollar in Pittsburgh and the selection of a fresh-
man team for next year, but he must also decide ontseveral ulti-
matums handed to him by Athletic Director Mylinski.

At Saturday’s Roundball Clin-
ic, Ridl remarked, “With the Pi-
rates and Steelers just barely miss-
ing divisional titles, the Penguins
nipping Montreal for the Stanley
Cup, and the Dukes going all the
way to the NCAA Eastern Region-
als, how are we ever going to
keep the fans and students flock-
ing to our basketball games?”

Assistant Tim Grgurich then
spoke up, “And how about those

DePasqua Redresses Team
In An Attempt To Develop

New Panther Football Look”

by DON BELLS

..rl DePasqua, in his first year as head football coach, has
initiated a new look in Panther football. , :

In an effort to change the Panther’s image, DePasqua’s

gridders will don uniforms unlike those worn by past Panther
footballers. Offensive players will wear gold-ruffled spread-

collar shirts with blue levy bell-
bottom trousers and sneakers. De-
fensive players will wear gold
turtle-necks with blue ski slacks
and boots. -

“We’ll still be the Blue and
Gold,” said DePasqua, insisting
that the change of unifroms will
change the Panther football im-
age only slightly.

In yesterda/y’s spring drills,
Panther defensemen donned the
new uniforms for the first time.

“Not only did those uniforms
give us a new image,” beamed
DePasqua, “but they proved more
feasible to wear.”

DePasqua was referring to the
warm ski slacks and high boots
which protected the grid defense-
men from the sub-20 degree tem-
peratures and snow.

“It gets awfully cold out there,”
said DePasqua. “The stress will
be on defense this year and any-
thing that will help’ my defensive
players is just ‘another *plus-ffac-

fl’§0I‘.” ‘ — -  H  -' ‘

  

 

“In fact,” continued DePasqua
“we might play defense 60-min-
utes per game if we have to.”

9

Panther offensive players have
yet to don their new uniforms.
‘_‘We’re afraid of tearing those
ruffles before the season,” admit-
ted DePasqua.

Pipers coming back?” Since Rich-
ard Mellon and Colonel Rock-
well have brought pro-ball back
to the “City of Winners,” Ridl
said that the University will hire

 

a five man publicity staff to keep .

the Panthers in the news.

“Heck, we’ll be lucky to aver- ‘

age 3,000 a game next year. What
can you do when the Steelers,
Penguins, and two powerful bas-
ketball clus are all bigwinners?”
said Ridl. The first problem that
Ridl will confront will be next
fall’s freshman squad.

Jim Monroe, one of the many
assistants, is currently looking
over a few 6'11’-’ boys in the Far
West. Ridl said, “I don’t know
who to accept.”

Both Ridl and Grgurich would
hate to turn down Jim Hobgood,
Dave Johnson, or Mark Balback.
Only six scholarships are avail-
able, and Ridl is deciding wheth-
er to go for height or ability.

“These big boys from out west
really want to come here bad—it’s
like a matter of life or death for
them. But, they're not real quick.
They’re all good athletes, but it’ll
take a real brainstorm to choose
the final six,” Grgurich stated.

Athletic Director Mylinski has-
n.’t been easing back in a rocker
e_ither. He told Ridl, “Either move
your home games to our new dom-
ed stadium or play away games
until the day our football team
breaks

Mylinski mentioned that 75,-
000 people could watch the Gold-
en Panthers play the likes of
UCLA, CMU, and Purdue under
the big dome. A spokesman for
the past season’s frosh, Mat Fur-
janic, stated that the hoopsters
would prefer the move. “It would
make us the darlings of Pitts-
burgh,” he said.

Myslinski then uttered, “We’ll
drive the Pipers right back out of
town like we did before.” Ridl,
however, pounded his fists sever-
al times. “There’s a certain tradi-
tion tied to the Field House dur-
ing the pas five years.

“I’d‘hage to be the one to break
it. I don’t care if 6,000 apathetic
students do march on my lawn

“A computer has no mind of its own. lts
‘brainpower’ comes from the people who
create the programs,” says Rod Campany.

Rod earned a BS. in Math in 1966. Today,
he’s an IBM Systems Programmer working on
a portion of Operating System/360, a
hierarchy of programs that allows a computer
to schedule and control most of its own

’ - -operations.

A mixture of science and art

“Programming” means writing the instruc-
tions that enable a computer to do its job.
Says Rod, “lt’s a mixture of science and art.
You’re a scientist in the sense that you have to
analyze problems in a completely logical way.

Programming at IBM

“|t’s a chance
to use everything
you’ve got’

“But you don’t necessarily hunt for an ulti-
mate right answer. There can be as many
solutions to a programming problem as
there are programmers. That’s where the art
comes in. Any given program may work, but
how well it works depends entirely on the
ingenuity of the programmer.”

Programmers hold a key position in the
country’s fastest growing major industry-
information processing. Business Week re-
ports that the computer market is expanding
about 20 percent a year.

You don’t need a technical degree

It you can think logically and like to solve
problems, you could become an IBM pro-

grammer no matter what your major. We’ll
start you off with up to twenty—six weeks of
classroom and practical training.
