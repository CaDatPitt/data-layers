Remix culture comes to Pitt

John Manganaro
For The Pitt News

It’s pitch blackinthe William PittUnion
Assembly Room.

The hum of a warming projector
comes from somewhere in the dark.
Suddenly, the room lights up in tech-
nicolor.

A rapid series of images ﬂashes
across a massive projector screen
hanging in ﬁ‘ont of the room, and the
eerie voice of an elderly woman splits
the air.

“Today we are going to create a
mash-up,” the “'I‘ales-of—the-Crypt”-
meets-Betty-Crockervoice explains. ‘A
ﬁ1nandint,erestingwaytomakesome-
thing fresh out of something stale.”

mentary, “RiP: A Remix Manifesto,”

mash—up music artistfromthe suburbs "

of Pittsburgh.

The ﬁlm made one thing clear: A
culture priding itselfon ﬁeedom, cre-
ativity and self—expression comes with
the development of electronic music,
which can be controversial when it
involves sampling music from other

“I‘m here because I‘m not cool
enough to get into electronic music on
myown,” joked David Landes, agradu—
atestudent studyingrhetoric and com-
munications. “Plus, I’m really interested
in the copyright and creativity issues
involved in the genre.”

Landes was one of a only handful
of students to arrive before the movie
began, butastheﬁlmplayed, more and
more students, attractedbythe music,
ﬁltered in from outside. By the end of
the movie, about 50 people sat in the
audience. ,

Paul Matthews, president of Pitts-

burgh Electronic Musicians, discussed
the development of electronic music
culture and difficulties electronic en-
thusiasts face on Pitt’s campus.

“We basically try to represent
the interests of the student body and
anyone who is interested in electronic
music,” Matthews said aboutthe group.
“Some people in our organization are
Djs, some are producers, some don’t
knowthe ﬁrst thing about electronic
music.”

Matthews said he believes many
Pitt students don’t understand what
electronic is. People have preconceived
notions about the electronic music
genre, he said.

“Our goal is to educate these peo-
ple,” Matthews said.

Matthews saidbefore he started lis-
tening to electronic music, he was as
prejudiced toward the genre, as many
people on campusaretoday. <

A better wayqto treat cancer

Eva Bugos
For The Pitt News

Researchers from Pitt’s School of
Medicine and the National Cancer
Institute discovered a molecule that
protects healthy tissue from radia-
tion damage while makingtumor cells
more sensitive to radiation.

Dr._]effrey Isenberg, aprincipal in-
vestigator in Pitt’s Vascular Medicine
Institute, and David D. Roberts, of
the National Cancer Institute’s Center
for Cancer Research, co-authored a
paper that was published Oct. 21 in
Science Translational Medicine.

This is apromisingpotential can-
cer treatment. Radiation is used in
cancer treatment to kill tumor cells.
However, radiation dosage must be
limited because radiation also kills
normal tissue. This causes side ef-
fects like nausea, vomiting, weakness
and fatigue. Long-term exposure can
lead to scarring and death of normal
tissue.

Isenberg’s and Roberts’ two labs
collaborated in researching a cell-
signaling pathway that inﬂuences the
body’s response to radiation. They
developed a therapy that blocks a
molecule called thrombospondin-1
from binding to its receptor, called
CD47.

The therapy has been effective in
cancer-bearing mouse models, as well
as in human cells. It has two beneﬁts
that make it a promising cancer treat-
ment. First, it renders radiation less
toxic to normal tissue. Thus, higher
doses of radiation can be adminis-
tered with lesser side effects. Second,
it makes cancer cells more sensitive to
the toxic affects of radiation. There-
fore radiation is more effective.

“If one was being seen and evalu-
ated and proceedingthrough a course
ofradiation treatment for cancer, this
therapy would be an ideal agent to

incorporate and allow enhanced dos-

mhﬁyouolt +4

age levels, probably, of radiation and
minimizingthe non-speciﬁcinjuryto
normal structures and maximizing
tumor killing,” Isenberg said.

Isenberg explained that, under
normal circumstances, tumors are
invaded by immune cells. Radiation
damages both cancer cells and im-
mune cells. However, with this new
treatment, normal immune cells have
resistance to the effects of radiation.
Therefore, after radiation, the im-
mune cells have not been disabled.
They can invade the cancer and de-
stroy it. So patients have the beneﬁt
of radiation that kills cancer cells,
plus the added beneﬁt of preserved
immune cells that invade the cancer
and continue to ﬁght it.

Isenberg said that a potential

treatment would not have to be ad-
ministered on the location of the
tumor. Patients could receive an in-
jection before undergoing radiation.
Additionally, a single dose is effective,
so patients would not need long-term
treatments. This minimizes potential
side effects of long-term drug treat-
ment.

“Our new sciencewill explore just
how high we can go with radiation,”
Isenberg said.

In experimental models, research-
ers saw dramatic improvement with
ﬁve— or six-fold greater levels of radia-
tion than is normally used. Investi-
gators will need to also explore the
toxicology and long-term side effects
of the therapy before it can be clini-
cally tested.

The treatment also has potential
applications for people who have
undergone accidental radiation ex-
posure in the nuclear energy ﬁeld,
aerospace and the military in con-
nection with bioterrorism.

This allows the University to posi-
tion itself for funding from pharma-
ceutical and radiation imaging com-
panies, as well as military or federal

funding.

Police to investigate mugging

Estelle Tran
Assistant News Editor

Police are investigating an attempted robbery
of a Pitt student Monday night.

Eight young black men began to follow the
student down the 300 block of Oakland Avenue
at about 9 p.m. and tried to take his bookbag,
Pittsburgh Police Sgt. Brian Elledge said. The
man said that the suspects tried to rip off his
bookbag and demanded money.

“I’m really lucky because I was a little too
brave, I think, with them,” the student, who
prefers to remain anonymous, said. “I basi-
cally told them to f"‘ck off and that they were
pieces of sh*t.” V

The student was talking to his mom on the
phone when the suspects surrounded him.
The student said they punched him in the face
and neck.

He said he hit one of the suspects in the face
with the hand holding his phone and broke
his phone.

He walked briskly toward Hillman Library
with the men following him. ‘

“I didn’t want to show panic because I didn’t
want them to pounce,” he said. The student
said he walked in the middle of the road to
increase his visibility. .

A His mother called the police.

When the student entered the library, he
borrowed a friend’s cell phone to call his mom
and tell her that he was safe.

Police met the student outside Hillman
Library. Elledge said that the man had a couple
lacerations on his face and bottom lip but re-
fused medical attention.

At the urging of his family, the student said
he went to the emergency room around 11
p.m. Afriend drove him to UPMC Presbyterian
hospital. ‘

The student said he never expected to be the
target of an attempted robbery but he doesn’t
want this experience to make him paranoid.

“I don’t want this to make me be scared of

A where I live,” he said. “I think I’m going to get a

little pepper-spray keychain, just in case.”

did not understand it,” Matthews said. “But I had
some good friends who were patient with me.
They showed me there was more to electronic
music thantechno.”

Matthews said the emerging electronic music
scene in Pittsburgh demonstrates a diversity in
electronic music.

“There are a lot of D]s in the Pittsburgh area
alone that play all diﬁerent styles of music,” he
said.

Matthews said he believes many people on
campus do like electronic music. They just don’t
realize it.

“Ifyou listentoany kind ofhip—hop these days,
it’s all really inﬂuenced by the electronic sound,” he
said.e“Think ofKanye West or Flo— Rida.Allofthat
stuff is done on synthesizers, and people love it.”

thusiast from Pittsburgh eager to ride the wave

is Paul Alexander.

“There is awhole culture centered aroundthis
music,” Fleetwood said. “Unfortunately, many
people aren’t aware of either the history, the di-
versity or exactly how different andﬁmthis music
and its culture canbe.” —

Fleetwood shared similar ideas with Mat-
thews about electronic music’s lack of popularity
on campus.

“I feel there is a general lack of experience
toward the genre, simply due to lack of proper
eiqaosure,” he said. “Certain styles and themes
have caught on inthe past, sure. But overall, Ithink
its takes a personal motivation to want to learn
something different and new. Many kids just don’t
have that.”

Fleetwood remained optimistic.

“We know how much we er1j oythis music,” he
reasoned. ‘Andinanagewithcookie-cut1ert11nes

tem.

The online Student Group Management Sys-
tem will allow student organizations to view any
group’s membership rosters and create rosters
and statuses on budget requests anytime. Shull
said student organizations do not have to use
the program unless they are requesting budget
allocations, but they will be required to use the
Symplicity website forthis purpose.

The program, covered by the student activi-
ties fee, would cost $4,000 to $12,500 for set—up
and customization of the system’s website and

an $8,500 annual fee for support and mainte-

nance.

Terrence Mﬂani, a Student Life administrator
and member of the allocations committee for
SORC, said the proposal for the new program
will be covered by an account within the student
activities fee used for printers, copy services or
“whatever else student organizations need,”
including the new management system. Other
ﬁmdingwill comefrom money left overfromthis
yeafs student activities ﬁmd.

SGB did not have to allocate money for this
project

“No sacriﬁces were made [by SGB],” Shull
said.

Milani said the University is working with
computer specialists to develop the program, al-
though it’s unclear when student organizations
canbegin to use it. _

“Our goal is to have the program roll out for
the spring semester; butthere is nohardschedule
with the company,” he said.

Milani also said that there is no written plan.

“The program is evolving. It’s experimental,”
he said.

Student organizations will need to be trained .

before using the program, Milani said.

“Student organization’s leaders and oﬂicers
will have the passwords and safeguards for use
of administrative services or individual group
needs,” he said.

Accordingto the proposal, SGB considered Col-
legiateLinl<, acompanythat operates the Outside
the Classroom Curriculum system and Orgsync,
which provides comparable applications.

Milani said the organizations chose Symplicity
because of its versatility and customization.

“Symplicity offers greater utility for commu-

nication, and [student organizations] can operate
and manage their own organization electroni-
cally,” he said. ‘

Pittalready uses Symplicityinadifferentform,
Shull said. The FutureLinks website, for career
planning and ﬁnding jobs, is used by the oﬂice of
Career Development. e

“We know how [FutureLinks] works and are
familiarwith the system,” Shull said. “[Symplicity]
will work similarly.”

Shull has been at the forefront of this project
and isusingthe programto promote SGB’s pledge

to go paperless and make the campus more eco-
friendly.

He explained howthe Boardis divided up into
groups of Board members working on various
projects, “including more recyclable trash cans”
at Pitt. .

“Going paperless is a long process, and it is
diﬂicultto makealot of progress inashort amount
of time,” Shull said.

Shull said there is no record of opposition to
the new program, and that the system is “abso-
lutely neede ” '

Organizations to use new system for requests

As president of Interfratemity Council, Shull
said the Greek community is also on board.

“’I‘hisway, the Greekcommunitywillbeableto
keep track of all 1,400 members,” he said.

Shull said students should take advantage of
what the program has to offer.

“[Student organizations] can even convert
documents to PDFs and Exce ,” he said.

Terrence Milani, astudent Life administrator
and member of the allocations committee for
SORC, said the two groups have a reputation of
helping each other.

Forced vaccines a must
for health care workers

ew York state health
N care workers didn’t have
much of a choice: get
vaccinated for H1N1 by the end
of November or risk losing their
jobs. Last week, however, state
health officials rescinded the or-
der after they learned New York
will receive only 23 percent of its
planned supply of the vaccine by
the end of the month.

According to Dr. Richard
Dairies, the state health commis-
sioner, the available supplies will
be given to pregnant women and
young people ﬁrst because the
virus can be especially harmful
to these groups.

To a portion of workers, it was
a measure of relief. Other health
care workers in the state objected
Daines’ order to make the H1N1
vaccine mandatory. They felt it
unfair that the state could force a
foreign substance into their bod-
ies. Health workers and unions
even sued the state, according to
the Associated Press. Carl Korn, a
spokesman for the New York State
United Teachers union, expressed
his discontent over compulsive
vaccines.

“This suit was never about the
safety of the vaccine or the merits
of it,” Korn said. “The suit was al-
ways about giving individuals the
choice, as adults, as to whether
or not they wanted to be vacci-
nated without the threat of ter-
mination.”

There’s no doubt the health
care workers faced a stubborn
ultimatum. Would most give up
their jobs just to avoid the vac-

cine? Probably not. The vaccines
have not been made mandatory
for the general public. And at the
rate of delivery of the vaccine -
even if the government willed it-—
such a condition would be unfea-
sible, not to mention even more
controversial. But for health care
workers, a compulsory vaccine is
a reasonable, proactive measure
despite their qualms.

Health care workers face a
higher risk of exposure to H1N1
by nature of their jobs, which
entail the preservation of the
physical well-being of the com-
munity around them. Should the
H1N1 vaccine grow more proliﬁc
at a steep rate, health care work-
ers especially can’t afford to be
hindered — or worse — by con-
tracting the virus. Those who
don’t support the measure are
likely wary of the fabled chronic
health detriments associated with
such a rapidly produced vaccine.
Perhaps no one can speculate
with certainty on potential side
effects. But in the case of H1N1
— although some argue they’re
comparatively miniscule —- there
have been deaths and other ef-
fects caused by the virus. There
are clearly known harms, so why
further the risk?

Hospitals, the assumed work-
place of health care workers, need
to absolutely take all measures
to avoid H1N1 contamination. If
a hospital workers are not vac-
cinated, the virus could spread
through the medical facility, and
the greater public would be at
risk.

Letter to the editor

To the editor,

As representation for black
students on this campus, the Black
Action Society does not agree with
or subscribe to the deﬁnitions of
Blackness described in Lewis Lehe’s
Oct. 26 column, “Cultural identity
separate from race.” Blackness is
not something that can be easily de-
ﬁned. Unfortunately, Lehe applies a

rather simple deﬁnition.

In many circles Black is used to
describe black people of the diaspo-
ra. In others, it’s used to describe
people who are descendants of those
enslaved in the mid—Atlantic slave
trade. And in some circles, as I’m led
to believe in the article, Black is used
to describe people who participate in
typical “black” activities, like mov-
ing to inner-city Chicago, going to

Next week’s mayoral electionwill have ,

far-reachingeffects onPittstudents, but
the Pitt College Republicans and College
Democrats have done little to engage
the mayoral candidates and involve
students in the electoral process.

The election is our chance to hold
the mayor’s office accountable for the
city’s handling of the G—2o Summit. It’s
anopportunitytoaddressthe proposed
studenttax, and it’s our chance to inﬂu-
ence city policies that affect job growth
and development in Pittsburgh.

But the College Republicans and
College Democrats, who were so
animated over last year’s presidential
election, have been almost silent on
the implications of this year’s mayoral
contest. There has been no tabling on
issues surrounding the mayoral elec-
tion, no majorvoterregistrationdrives
or literature drops.

Of course, the mayoral candidates
aren’tasglamorousasPresidentBarack
Obama, and local politics don’t grab
people’s attention the way hot-button
national topicsdo.

That said, policies implemented
by the mayors office have afar greater
effect on students’ everyday lives than

does thewarinlraq, stem cell research
or abortion.

The intriguingpartofthisisthatthe
Pitt College Democrats and College Re-
publicans understand the importance
oflocal politics and have been active in
other local races in this election cycle.

The Republicans campaigned in
Ross Township for City Councilman
Matt Drodz earlierthis month, andthe
Democrats have been fairly active in
support of Judge Jack Panella, a can-
didate for the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court.

Obviously, these groups understand
the importance of local and state elec-
tions. However, there are reasons that
Pitt’s major political groups are not
involved speciﬁcally in the mayoral
election.

First, the College Democrats areob—
ligated by their constitution and their
relationship withthe DemocraticParty
at the state and national level to sup-
port only candidates norninatedbythe
Democratic Party.

Ian Lauer, President of Pitt College
Democrats, said thatforthese reasons,
the PittDemocrats have no choice other
thanto supportMayorLuke Ravenstahl
inthe mayoral election. Both Indepen-
dent mayoral candidates approached
Lauer about comingto Pitt andtalking
to the College Democrats, but the Col-
lege Democratsareunabletohost other

Parties handcuffstudents

candidates once a Democrat has been
oﬂicially nominated, Lauer said.

Second, the mayor’s oﬂice hasn’t
reached out to the College Democrats
this semester. The last time the mayor
spoke to the Pitt Democrats was last
semester, and he’s canceled meetings
withthe Pitt Democrats multiple times
since then, Lauer said.

Third, Pitt Democrats rnightbe ob-
ligated to support Ravenstahl, but Pitt
students in general are fairly hostile to
the mayor as a result of his handling
of the G—2o Summit and his proposed
studenttax.

Jim Sheppard, president of the
Pennsylvania College Democrats,
recognized that “Pitt students in gen-
eral have their qualms with the mayor
right now’ ’and saidthatthe Pitt chapter
could focus on other races rather than
supportinganunpopularincumbentin
the mayoral election.

However, Sheppard said that any
College Democrats chapter that failed
to endorsethe nominated Democratic
candidateinalocal race couldface hav-
ing its charter revoked.

Similarly, the Pitt Republicans’

have refrained from endorsing a can-
didate because there are no legitimate
Republicans running for mayor, and
the candidate closest to their politics,
KevinAcklin,wasblackballedby county

Dem, GOP policy distorts mayoral election

Howard 4 6

wouldn’t run for mayor as a Republican, Pitt Col-
lege Republicans President Zack Bombatch said.

Forthis reason, the Pitt Republicans have not
madeanendorsementinthe mayoral election and
have largely watched the race from the sidelines.

The conduct of both the Pitt Dems and Re-
publicans demonstrates that the Independent
candidates in the mayoral election are right: So-
lutions for local issues aren’t to be found along
partisan lines.

Because of the tvvo-party system and the
control that both parties exert over their cam-
pus organizations, otherwise politically active
Pitt students have been sidelinedinanimpoitant
mayoral election.

Rather than tepidly express the will of party
bosses, student groups should explore all candi-
dates and support the one that best represents
their interests. By running as both a Republican
and Democrat, Ravenstahl has made a mockery
oflocal party identiﬁcationto the extent that stu-
dents should no longer feel bound by partisan
identiﬁcation.

This election cannot be about partisan poli-

' tics. It must be about defending our interests as

students and our place in this city.

a black church and marrying a black woman.
It is a term some people identify themselves
with, while others prefer not to. There is not a
typical experience one must have to be Black.
People who identify themselves as Black in
Harlem will grow up with an experience com-
pletely different from a black person raised in
Portugal, Tanzania, Cuba or Paris.

It must be noted that identiﬁcation is a
choice, an individual choice that should not
be judged by anyone else. The article tries to
justify the most appropriate and convenient
way to categorize avery large group of people.
It is not people of African descent that it is
trying to categorize. People of African descent

come in all racial and cultural backgrounds. It
is people with a shade of brown skin and coarse
hair that the article attempts to categorize.
Unfortunately, though it may be inconvenient,
there is no proper term to identify us all.
This act of endorsing the term “Black” over
“African—American” itself is irresponsible. It

is notour place to tell anyone who they are"

- or who they were. At most we can educate
and learn from one another. Let's engage one
another in dialogue. If we are curious as to how
someone identiﬁes, we should simply ask.

Scandalous Halloween costumes are a college student tradition.

' Samantha Stahl
Columnist

In grade school, Halloweenwas about
gathering copious amounts of candy
and having your mother terriﬁed that
the creepy neighbor might hide some
anthrax in with the Milky Ways.

In high school, Halloween was
about j oking with your friends about
being the oldest trick—or—treaters in
the neighborhood.

In college, however, Halloween is
about making questionable choices
about hemlines.

This weekend, partygoers every-
where have the opportunity to banish
their usual jeans-and-tank uniform to
the back of their cramped closets in
favor of something a little bit more
 original.

There’s something about Hallow-
een that gives people the conﬁdence
to do things they ordinarily wouldn’t
dare. Maybe it’s all the chocolate.

_ A Maybe it’s all the b1ood—red jungle
juice. Regardless, I just feel sorry

for the girls who regularly dress like
they’re hopping on a table for open-
heart surgery —- that is to say, in very
little clothing. For one weekend each
year, these little tartlets have compe-
tition. Girls that usually bare less skin

Ted 'I'iller’s “Count Dracula” feeds
onanaudiencés laughtermorethanits

2 screams —— not that its comedic slant

stops fragile characters Mina and Sybil
fromﬁllingthe theaterwith morethan
a few of the latter.

For Director W. Stephen Coleman,
the task was to “capture the eccentric
characters and gothic horror as aback-
drop to humor.”

Interesting sets and props make

but in a good way

the gothic style clear to the audience,
including a revolving bookcase, sus-
pended bats, apaintingwithalight1'ng
effect, afog machine, strobe lights and
fake gun shots. The castle set comple-

The play has eccentric characters in
spades: Sybil Seward (Holly Thuma),
forexample, aladywithapenchantfor
sherry, feathers and men who inspire
shivers -- including Count Voivode
Dracula (Sam 'I‘urich), himself.

Count Dracula’s arrival is memo-
rable, to say the least. His costume
alone induces giggles, but the accent
and the dramatic ﬂair nearly mm the
character into an over-the—top carica-
ture. Forthe actor, though, it’sallabout
the research.

“Meredith Conti, the show’s dra-
maturgical coach, isverythomugh and

interested. She madeuspackets with in-
formation and resources,” Turichsaid.
“I watched the old Dracula movies and
read the book.”

Cameron Crowe, who plays Ren-
ﬁeld, took on the character, jumping
over a couch onstage and hopping
around like Gollum from “Lord of the
Rirlgfﬂ

“Iwatchedvideos of schizophrenics
on You'I‘ube,” he said. “The dialecfs
been tough. Holly taught the cast.”

Thuma, along with co-stars 'Durich
and ElenaAlexandratos—playingHel—
ga Von Helsing — are teaching artists
with Pitt’s department of theatre arts.

tion” suddenly check their sartorial morals at
the door and take to the streets looking like,
well, a streetwalker.

There’s nothing quite as fulﬁlling as getting
liquored up and revealing to someone, while
wearing fairy wings, that you’ve secretly been
eyeing him from the other side of your Intro
to Cultural Anthropology lecture all semester.
The only thing better? Having to walk home the
next morning in said fairy wings. Don’t forget,
kids, if your costume advertises that you’re the
kind of person who will indulge in a one—night
stand, the walk of shame will be that much
more embarrassing. I once heard a story about
some poor guy who had to walk home at 9:30
am. dressed as aballerina. The worst part? The
ﬁrst of November was a weekday, so everyone
saw him on their way to class. Oops.

In case you’ve waited until the last minute

and still don’t have a clue what to dress up as
this year, I’ve taken the liberty of thinking up a
few suggestions, ranging from hooker to class
act, from which to choose, according to your
personal tramp preference. From this point
forward, we will euphemistically refer to this
skank factor as the broadometer.

Michelle Obama: Belted plaid cardigan, ﬁlll
pleated skirt, pointy ﬂats.

, Broadometer: Zero.vHello; it’svtheﬁrst lady! ~

Though, if you really wanted to be risqué, I sup-
pose you could make it a rnini—pleated skirt.

Cast of “Gossip Gir ”: This style—centric teen
drama has some of the best costumes in the
business, so pick your favorite character and
go to town. p ' ,

Broadometer: 2.5 (Blair)—8.6 (Serena).
Depending on your level of modesty, there’s a
look for everybody. Conservative gals can don
a bowed headband and go as Miss Waldorf,

while the risk-takers can take a cue from Ser-
ena. (Seriously, the level of cleavage she’s been
revealing lately is unbelievable. Who’s allowed
to go to work like that?) And if you want to
go with a more traditional, gothic Halloween
look — in the same vein as zombies and Fran—
kenstein’s monster — just pile on the eyeliner
and go asjenny.

Adam and Eve: Get some ﬂesh-colored
undergarments —- or not — and accessorize
with leaves.

Broadometer: 10. I mean, you’re basically
naked. It doesn’t get much more scandalous
than that.

Personally, I think a more admirable al-
ternative to dressing like a strumpet is to use
Halloween as an opportunity to test out a fash-
ion trend you’re otherwise too scared to try.
Looking for an excuse to buy aviators? Guys,
go as Michaeljackson; ladies, Amelia Earhart.
Not sure if you can pull off rompers? Dress up
as anything in a uniform — a mailman, UPS
delivery person, etc. Craving the opportunity
to don some sparkly latex? Give David Bowie
a try.

If you’re looking to go pants-less this Hal-
lows Eve but want something more original
than the Queen of Leotards, Lady Gaga, I say

"*'dress up ‘asmy favorite muse, "Edie Sedgwick. '

Pull on some black tights, a striped shirt and a
fur jacket. Don’t be surprised if someone asks
you to star in their next movie project.

Really, the costume possibilities are end-
less. Just use a little creativity and have ﬁin
with it. So enjoy a safe and happy Halloween,
boys and girls. Be sure to check your candy for
suspicious punctures and maybe throw a big
sweatshirt into your bagfor the morning after.
You know, just in case.

Bruce Mcconachie chairs the department of
theaterartsandplays opposite Thurnainthe play.
Althoughthey portraybrother and sister, he plays
the role more straightforwardly and dryly witty
thanThuma, who applies anoutlandish andﬂam-
boyant comedic style.

Ana Carolina Noriega plays Wilhelmina Mur-
ray, the resident damsel. When Mina becomes
hypnotized and slowly takes on vampiric char-
acteristics, she attempts to seduce her lover. To
whichjonathan Harker (Eric Prendergast) replies,
“Fiancé is the proper term.” At her most critical
moments of change she uses dancer-like leaps and
rumbling growls, which result in instant laughs.

Prendergastseemedtobeinthe spirit ofthings,
playing with sound bites after the performance.
“There are lots of ptms about vampires,” he said.
“It didn’t sucktoo badly.”

In any theater production, actors have to cope
withunpredictable events. Crowe injuredhistoein
apreviewperformance, and afew student-induced
interruptions shook Stephen FosterMemorialwith
ill-timed celebration.

“Remind me notto schedule aproduction dur-
ing Homecoming,” Coleman said. “It must have
been frightful for [the actors’] concentration.”

On opening night, the fesﬁvities interfered
with the creepy, quiet arrrbience of the play, but
it enhanced the comedic elements. The actors
handled the inconvenience well, goingforlaughs
rather than letting the noise distractthem.

Minalooked around cornicallywhen the noise
disruptedaquiet moment, while herco-stars opted
for well-timed ad-libs.

“What frightened you, Mina‘? Was it the ﬁre-
works?” came from a concerned Dr. Seward and
ascream of, “The Masterpromised melcould see
the ﬁreworks!” from a distressed Renﬁeld.

Like an actor’s ad—lib, Count Dracula’s timing
works out rightwith currenttrends inpop culture
andwith Halloween just aroundthe corner. There
willbe aspecial matinee on Halloween, for alittle
“scary ﬁrn,” as Crowe called it.

“How popular are vampires right now? It’s
an extremely popular phenomenon,” Coleman
said.

The directors choice of the quintessential
vampire storywas no coincidence. Coleman said
he wanted to do one last play before he retired —
somethingﬁ.1n——and“C0untDracula” brings his
directingcareerfull circle.

Theﬁrstplayhe directedwasa“silly little one-
act play with avampiric element,” Coleman said.
“My teacherforbade me to do it. Nowl have more
freedom.”

Tiller’s “Count Dracula” bends the traditional
story a bit, but only for laughs. Coleman takes
Til1er’s comedy and puts his own perspective on
it. “You can only my to capture the proper style,
not realism, but play it u'uthfully,” Coleman said.
“We push beyond whatTi1ler did. You neverwant
to offend or challenge the playwright, but to re-
capture that spirit.”

‘Lights’ gloomy, too often in shadow

Grade: B

Lights’ debut album, T/ye I1Ls2‘enz'ng, is a surpris-
ingly enjoyableﬁrst release from the electro-pop
band.

The minglingofjammingtechno beats withan
old-school pop sound creates an interesting spin
on the genre and is usually pleasing to the ear.

It embraces pop’s ability to carry a beat and
allow for a theme about a love or a relationship
that’s sofrighteningly deep and intense, eachlover
can’t live without the other.

But nothing is perfect. Out of all the songs,
a handful touch on the idea of being more than
unhappy with where you are. It’s a little disheart-
ening.

Sure, every person has experienced one of
the multiple moments Lights breathes into musi-
cal form. On the other hand, it’s probably bestto
eventually be proactive about one’s life, which is

exactly the opposite ofwhat Lights seemsto advise
in many songs.

Don’t look to this album for much inspiration
in thatﬁeld.

Above all, it’s good entertainment. “Preten ”
is an especially sweet track about playing pretend
and rememberingwhatitis like tobeakid. There
are eventwo versions of this songfor musical lov-
ers: an upbeat; techno-mix and a classical piano
version.

By the album’s end, though, just don’t forget
about moving forward and living for today after
waxing nostalgic about your childhood.

Weiler has started in every gameat V

The junior started all 18 games as a freshman, all 20 as a sophomore and all 18 this past season, helping the Panthers go 8-5-5

Weiler 4 1 ‘

(10) and helped accumulate
a school record—tying eight
victories.

“I wanted to go to a city
school,”Wei1er said. “That’s a
big reason I came here. Also, all
of Pitt’s sports are really good.
I wanted to come to a place
where I could play as a fresh-
man and contribute right away.”

As a first-year player, Weiler
was one of three athletes to
start all 18 games. She’ followed
that season by starting in all 20
games as a sophomore.

But like any freshman, she
still had lessons to learn once
arriving on campus. One of the
most important stages in her
development was discovering
how to channel her always-
emotional play.

Pitt coach Sue—Moy Chin
said that Weiler has developed
the ability to control her pas-
sion for the game, something
she had difficulty with when
she ﬁrst put on a Pitt uniform
three years ago.

“She wants to win all the
time, and sometimes it’s
frustrating [to lose] when she
works so hard,” Chin said. “She
wants to run up the field and
score the goal, too.”

Chin said Weiler matured
and learned to trust her team-
mates, a statement with which
Weiler agreed. Weiler added .,
that she developed the abil-
ity to keep her composure in
high—pressure situations, while
adjusting to the highly competi-
tive and fast-moving nature of

 
   

college soccer.

Weiler arrived at Pitt with
experience as a forward, a
midﬁelder and a defender. Chin
said the team needed Weiler in
the back, so they converted her
to play that position.

Now, Chin said, Weiler an-
chors the backﬁeld along with
senior Maura Caslin.

“She’s done a fantastic job of
learning the position, under-
standing the situation and
evolving,” Chin said. “She’s a
tremendous person and a really
dedicated player.”

That dedication allowed
Weiler to become a leader for
the record—setting Pitt squad,
despite her quiet tendencies.

Of all the men’s basketball players mak-

Adams,whoisinhisﬁrstyearatPitt —

aftertransferringfrom Centenary Col-

intrasquad scrimmage with 21 points.
The senior guard isn’t just known for
his defense, though. He was the Sum-
mit League’s Defensive Player of the
year in 2008.

“I’mtryingto establish myselfas an
oifensive player, as well,” Adams said.
“Coach [Dixon] has been telling meto
shoot if Pm open.”

‘ Adams went 8-of-11,lin'cluding ,

5-of-7 from 3-point range. IA-Iealso

“We’re a little undermanned right
now,” Pitt coachjamie Dixon said.

Along with Adams, ﬁeshmen Pat-
terson, Zanna, Taylor and Richardson
appeared in their ﬁrst games as Pan-
thers. Woodall, a redshirt freshman,
played in just 10 games last season
before suffering an injury that cut his
season short.

“Execution of plays was good con-
sidering we have so many new guys,”
Dixon said.

Wanamaker led the Goldteamwith

It ’s time for Pittsburghers to wear pinstripes

As the City of Champions, it’s Pittsburgh’s job to pick a side in the World Series, and the Yankees are the logical choice

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Edi-tor

_ ~ Sorry, Pittsburgh, but other cities do occasionally

Winsports championships, and tonight oneteam
will get closer when the ﬁrst game of the World
Series between the Philadelphia Phillies and New
York Yankees takes place.

Now, as 2009 comes to a close, so does your
reign as the City of Champions. Of course, the
Steelers and Penguins could both repeat, giving
youthetitleagainnextyear. Butwhystartplanning
so far in advance?

This is your year, Pittsburgh, and the World
Series isthelastmajor sports titleup for grabs. You
need to get in on it and pick ateam to pull for.

Thetwoteams’ strengths andweaknesses have
beenanalyzed everypossiblewayoverthe pastfew
days. Butyou don’twantto pickyourdefactoteam
forthe nexttwoweeksbytheir rosters. Intact, the
two teams are pretty evenly matched. It should be
a competitive series that could go seven games.

So then how do you pick which team to
back?

\ Now, you don’t want to go by fan bases, since
Philadelphians and New Yorkers are two of the
most obnoxious, annoying sports fans. It’s going
to hurt to join either side. There are other ways,

though-

Tostart,thePhi1liesarethedefendingchamps, k

and Pittsburgh certainly likes its winners. The
Phillies have lovable playerslikeRyan Howard and
Pedro Martinez,which mightbe reason enoughto
jumptowardthe redandwhite. Plus, who doesrft
love “Rocky” or the Liberty Bell?

You could also go with the Phillies because, if
theywin, thatkeeps thetitle in-state, andyou could
startcallingPennsylvaniatheState ofchampions.

metaYankeefanafewyears agothatwas really
loud and insufferable, and they spend the most
money.
Yes,theYankeesareveryeasytohate.In2002, —

Red Sox president and born Pittsburgher Larry
Lucchino referredtothe Yankees asthe “Evil Em-
pire” to The New York Times, and the nickname
has stuck ever since.

cc  

Come or1, Pittsburghers, the Phillies could be your Alderaan.

Of course, there is a bit of airivalry between the
two cities-. In tact, this very publication suggested
Pit1sburgh’s new nickname shouldbethe “City of
not-Philadelp ' ” just earlier this week.

Soperhaps that’s notthewayto go. Thatleaves
us with the Yankees.

Let’s just get everythingblatantly negative out
of the way: The Yankees spend the most money,
have won the most championships, spend the
most money, have Alex Rodriguez, shave their
illustrious history down everyone’s throats, you

[Kat Weiler] leads by being
there every day in practice and
working hard.

Sue—Moy Chin

She tries to lead by playing with
enthusiasm, Weiler said, and remaining
calm while never giving up on games.

“She’s kind of a quiet leader,” Chin
said. “She’s not very vocal, but she leads
by example. She leads by being there .
every day in practice and working hard. I
think the other girls feed off of that.”

As a central defender, Chin said
Weiler is responsible for covering for
her teammates, so leadership ability is
necessary. Weiler added that the defense
found success as a unit because they all
learned how to help one another.

“It was deﬁnitely great chemistry
between all four of us,” Weiler said. “We
played as one unit. If someone ran past
one of us, there would,be another one of
us right behind.”

Weiler brings several solid physical
skills to the team, Chin said, including 4 ‘
her organizational abilities and her one-
on—one defense.

Most importantly, however, is the
dedication and leadership Weiler brings
to the field, Chin said. She takes it upon
herself to Organize the backﬁeld and has
grown into a very thorough defender.

“I_’_m disciplined and I’m a really hard
worker,” Weiler said. “I love the game, so
that makes’ it easier.”

Finally, Lewis was named a mid-

Pitt’s Big East Honors

Pitt junior strong safety Dom

Defensive Player of the Week. DeCicco
had 10 tackles in Pitt’s 41-14 win over
South Florida on Saturday.

It was DeCicco’s second game in a
row with 10 tackles, as he had seven solo
and three assist tackles against Rutgers
on Oct. 16. He leads the team with 62
tackles and two interceptions, and his 7.8
tackles per game ranks seventh in the Big
