Alcohol

offenses
increase
this year

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Pitt police brought up 26 people on
various charges the weekend before
classes started this year, more than
three times the number of charges
that police made two years earlier
on that same weekend.

Of the 26 people charged from
Aug. 26 to 28, 10 were cited for un-
derage drinking.

That same week before classes
started, Residence Life reported
12 alcohol law violations to the Pitt
police, most of which took place in
dorm rooms.

The number of arrests this year
contrasts with theeight charges made
by Pitt police forthe same weekendin

2009. Three out of the eight charges .

were for underage drinking.

In 2009, the most recent num— ..
bers available, Pitt police received Y

193 reports of liquor law violations
intotal. ‘
University spokesman John Fe-

dele said that While there are usu-

ally extra police patrols when school
starts, the difference in the number
of charges between 2009 and this
year is not a result of extra patrols,
but rather of more people commit-
ting crimes.

“The police respondto complaints

‘ orcallsfor assistance, aswell as their

own observations, and the number of
citations andarrests will vary from
year to year based on the number of

Global
summit

to come

in 2012

The World will revisit Pittsburgh
next year. This time, instead of fo-
cusing on G—20 leaders, all eyes will
beon potential future leaders.

Organizers for the 2012 One
Young World Summit announced
they would hold the third annual
event in Pittsburgh next October.
The summit brings together about
2,000 young delegates from around
the world to discuss issues such as
global health, the environment and
religion.

Steven Sokol, president of the
World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh,
said that the bid process was very
competitive. The World Affairs
Council of Pittsburgh is one of the
companies that makes up Pitts-
burgh Partnership, the group tha
created the bid. ' -

“One Young World made it very
clear early on in the process that
they would accept only one bid per
country,” he said. “This was a big
breakthrough for us in Pittsburgh
as the sole U.S. bid city.”

Melek Yazici, the 2011 Pitts-
burgh delegate for the One Young
World summit that occurred this
past weekend in Zurich, said that
the majority of the summit involved
attendingspeeches by keynotes
speakers and networking with other
delegates from different parts of
the World.

Residence Life is not unusual during
the ﬁrst week of school.

“It’s relatively common to have
alcohol-related violations of the Stu-
dent Code of Conduct early in the

The 12 students reported by
Residence Life were referred to the-

“Our resident assistants and

said. “Students who have had aju— .

will go through the regular judicial
process.”

Pitt’s Judicial Board hears cases
when students violate part of the

Pittsburgh beats out three cities for summit spot

Summit 1 1

Pitt. The Muslim native of Turkey is working
toward her MBA at the Katz Graduate School
of Business. ’ V ~

During the summit, Yazici said that the
delegates listened to various renowned in-
dividuals, including Crown Prince Haakon
of Norway and Egyptian activist and Google
executive Wael Ghonim, who “motivated us
to make a change in the world.”

Previous speakers have also included

V Archbishop and Nobel Peace Prize~winner

Desmond Tutu, former United Nations Sec-
retary—General Koﬁ Annan and U.S. Sen.John

.“Basically you have a global pool of very
successful; professionals, activists and stu-
dents in one place and you. get to have inter-
esting conversations with them about what
they do, where they are from, and what they
are in,” Yazici said. «

Pittsburgh’s bid for host "contained up ' t

to 36 letters of support from people such as
former presidents George Bush and Jimmy

Carter, Sen.]ohn Kerry and Chancellor Mark

Nordenberg.

N ordenberg said in his letter that Pitt will
look to support the summit if it comes to the
region.

“I believe that One Young World’s commit-
ment to nurturing future leaders in hopes of
bringing positive changes to our world would
receive positive support from our region,”
Nordenberg said.

In the ﬁnal round of selection, Melbourne,
Australia, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates,
were eliminated, leaving onlyjohannesburg
and Pittsburgh. At this point in the bid pro-
cess, a representative from One Young World
conducted site visits for both cities.

While in Pittsburgh, the representative
had the opportunity to see PNC Park, Heinz
Field, the Duquesne Incline and the University
of Pittsburgh. . .

“The representative loved the Cathedral of
Learning, especially the Nationality Rooms,”
Sokol said. “She was also blown away coming
through the tunnels seeing the emerging View
of the city.”

Katie McSorley, the head of the Pittsburgh
ofﬁce at Euro RSCG, a marketing company
that helped found the summit, said Pittsburgh
won the title of host because of the city’s pas-
sion and the amount of accommodations it
could provide for the summit‘.

“There! were a lot of little pieces that
showed great passionfor One Young World
and Pittsburg ,” Mcsorley said. “This will
really showcase the city and the leadership
in thelcity. It showed that the community
came together for the common good of Pitts-
burg .” .. O
V Those wanting to apply as a delegate had
to ﬁll out the One Young World application,
but also write a short essay explaining what

. they could contribute and how they would

beneﬁt from the program.

In October, we will see Pittsburgh's name

Yacizi said that during the summit,
which costs each delegate $4,000,
Pittsburgh will be ﬁlled with a diverse
group of people that will want to ex-
plore the city, which will be good for
local businesses.

“In October, we will see Pitts-
burgh’s name in a lot of the tweets
and Facebook messages,” she said.
“Young people will promote our city

to other young people.” A

Plagiarism
vs. the net

Instructors, take note: Should you ever assign
a term paper on plagiarism, be sure none of
your students copy and paste material from
this editorial.

According to a recent Pew Research Center
survey, 55 percent of college presidents believe
student plagiarism has increased in the past
10 years. Of these respondents, 89 percent
believe “computers and the Internet” have
facilitated the resurgence of the practice.

, Although we have no way of ascertaining

whether plagiarism has indeed spiked — the’

2010 NewYork Times article “Plagiarism Lines
Blur for Students in Digital Age” seems to in-
dicate it has — what we can say deﬁnitively
is that it’s a major problem on campus. We all
know someone who has copied and pasted a
Wikipedia article into their paper, and more
often than not, we know because they bragged
to us about getting away with it.
Nevertheless, claiming thellntemet merely
exacerbates plagiarism seems myopic. While
it provides students with a plethora of mate-
rial to steal —— and libraries accomplish the
same function — it also affords instructors
invaluable preventative tools.
Pamela O’Brien, the Associate Director
of Pitt’s Public and Professional Writing cer-

tiﬁcate, believes that, in her experience, pla-

giarism has indeed risen in the past 10 years

— largely due to the Internet. At the same"

time, she feels better equipped to stop it.

“There has been more put online for us to
make us aware of what resources we have and
what the policies are,” O’Brien said.

One such resource is turnitin.com, a site
that cross—references a given text with 14 bil-
lion web pages, highlighting portions that
prove particularly suspicious. SafeAssign,
a service free to all Blackboard enterprise
clients, accomplishes a similar function.

Administrators need not resort to special
software, however, to determine whether cer-
tain passages have been lifted.

“Students don’t realize that teachers care-
fully read their work,” O’Brien said. “If I’m
reading something they wrote, I can tell'when-
all of a sudden it sounds diﬁ'erent.’*

At the very least, simply typing a sentence
into Google will reveal with fairly dependable
results the sites containing the same sentence
— an unheard-of convenience in the pre-
Intemet era.

The Web may or may not be the culprit for

this supposed spike in plagiarism; it’s possible I

instructors have merely begun identifying it
more, thanks to the aforementioned tech-
niques. In any case, the Internet’s advantages
outweigh its downsides — for both teachers
and students. i

MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF’ AMERICA

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

When you’re new to campus, college can
be rather daunting. What’s with all of these
boring lecture classes? Do those delicious
pizzas really cost a mere $5? What are some
cool “hipster” things that you should know
about? What’s the best way to hardgain a
quick freshman 15? Who’s the most talented
baller in the NBA? Which franchise player’
should be drafted ﬁrst in a fantasy football
“keeper” league? -  F '
Fear not! Although we’ve answered a lot
of these questions in" previous advice col-
umns, we’re now going to take a page from
second-century encyclopedist Sextus Pom-
peius Festus and survey the Pitt experience
from A to Z. 7
America, United States of. The country
you leave when you study abroad, America

. is notable for its mediocre bakeries, remark-

able levels of human and feline obesity and
the best core group of Madden NFL gamers
in the entire world. '

Beer pong. If you’re over 21 andlooking to

get frosty and smash-faced, beer pong is the-

game for you. Nothing says good times quite
like a shindig where ﬁve beer pong games are

taking place simultaneously and everyone in ’

attendance is too drunk to even speak.
Centre ‘Avenue. Quite possibly the ﬁnest
stretch of real estate in Pittsburgh, this scenic
boulevard is Pittsburgh’s answer to Chicago’s
“Magniﬁcent Mile.” Strolling from Centre
and Craig to Centre and Millvale on a breezy
spring day is an unforgettable experience.
Downtown. The part of the city where
even angels fear to tread, “dahntahn” Pitts-
burgh consists of a series of gloomy gray
skyscrapers where sad men and women in

ill—ﬁtting blue suits with ’80s hair go to en—_

gage in marathon rounds of data entry and
Internet browsing. ‘
Easy, taking it. One of the goals of any
well-planned class schedule is a slate of “cake”
or “blow-oﬂ"’ classes that don’t have atten-
dance policies. Once you’ve got four of those
beauties in place, you can focus on what really
matters: taking it easy. ' ’

Football, fantasy. Perhaps your best op- ’

portunity to keep track of a series of meaning-
less statistics, fantasy football has imbued the
careers of NFL also-rans like Kellen Clemens,
Willis McGahee and anyone on the Bengals
with tremendous signiﬁcance.

GPA. If you’ve played your cards right,
you’re in line for a 4.0 GPA. But what if your
rogue instructor fails to recognize the inher-
ent genius of your Wikipedia summary and
gives you an A—? Then that person deserves

Escapism is an idea often found in music, but
the listener can’t always pick out an artist’s
inspiration.

Zach Condon’s obvious harkening to the
nostalgia of the Balkans and Eastern Europe
in his ﬁrst album, The Gulag Orkestar, and

then to the bustling street life of France in ‘

The Flying Club Cup reﬂected a willingness
to combine the lilting themes of world music
with more familiar Western chords.

The Rip Tide, the third product of Con-
don’s expansion into a band as Beirut, shifts
the tone to traditional American pop —
crisp, appealing and subdued — while keep-

ing the Euro-inﬂuenced instrumentation
and feel.

By creating a ﬂowing, nine-track com-
position, Condon does not impose the ca-
cophony of his prior works upon his audi-
ence, but instead allows his crooning to lull
and soothe.

The Santa Fe native employs minimalistic
melancholia, evident in the three chorus
repetitions of the song “East Harlem,” which
opens with “Another rose wilts in East Har-
lem / And uptown downtown a thousand
miles between us / She’s waiting for the night
to fall / Let it fall, I’ll never make it in_time.”
He uses uplifting acoustics, deliberately
avoiding the electronic experimentation
of his contemporaries Bon Iver and Sufjan
Stevens.

Despite being youthful and lo—ﬁ, the
songs “Goshen” and “Santa Fe” maintain
a newfound elegance in the still—maturing
Condon, who stretches his subject matter
from a deceased soldier to ﬂeeting love.

The warmth of a more experienced voice,
feel and message ultimately allows for “easy
listening” and a growing audience. I

_ MOVIE REVIEW .

Society infectedgwith paranoia, fear in “Contagion”,

Natalie Bell a very real level of horror about the
Magazine Editor potential contagions they come into‘

“Contagion”
Directed by Steve

Soderberghl

Starring: Matt Damon, Jude
Law, Laurence

Fishburne, Kate Winslet
Grade B ’

If you touch your face, you will die.

At least that’s what happens in “Con-
tagion” when an unholy combination of
pig and bat disease wreak havoc on the
human population, annihilating some-
thing likes percent of the world. The
movie follows severa_l characters,. from
an immune man whose wife was the first
infected to the head of the Center for
Disease Control — and some are more
endearing than others.

From a cinematographic perspec-
tive, the film does an excellent job of
storytelling withirnages. When the'vi—
rus begins to spread, the camera’s eye

contact with on a daily basis. It helps
propel the story forward far better than
any dialogue would.

Plot-wise, the directors took an in-
teresting direction. Instead ofjust fo-
cusing on the sickness, a huge portion
of the movie is dedicated to exposing
the greed of some and the generosity
of others. It very astutely shows how
‘with such an outbreak, the contagion
is not only physical — people’s minds
become infected with fear, paranoia
and greed.

It’s an excellent point. So well done,
in fact, that it’s debatable whether the_
whole movie wasn’t meant to be a po-
tential metaphor. Perhaps it was meant
to highlightthe capitalist tradition of
profiting from others’ misery: Through-
out the film, the pharmaceutical compa-
nies try to rub elbows with ajournalist
(Jude Law), who predicted the illness,
to figure out the next big thing in medi-
cine, saying that they didn’t create the
need,‘ they’re only meeting it.

,Panthers hit the road for

- Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

In the early part of the season, the
Panthers have made the most of
their home-court advantage. After
hosting two tournaments at the
Fitzgerald Field House, the Pitt
volleyball team has emerged with
a 6-1 record and will head down

iﬁsouth for the weekend.

“As a team, we feed off of the
energy of a home crowd,” senior
middle blocker Kiesha Leggs said
after a recent victory. “It means a
lot to us to go out and defend our
home court.”

The Panthers have been suc-
cessful in that defense and hope to
bring that attitude of dominance to
the road as they travel to Florida
to compete in this weekend’s Uni-

_versity of Central Florida Tour— '

"ffament. It will be their ﬁrst time
playing away from the Fitzgerald
Field House this season.

According to Leggs, playing as
the “away” team does make a dif-
ference, but she is conﬁdent that
the Panthers are ready for the
challenge.

“When we play on the road, we
need to take on a different mental
focus,” Leggs said. “The court is
not as familiar and our fans are not

gthere, but we know we have to play
the game the same wayand retain
our mental toughness.”

Head coach Toby Rens agreed
that road games present a unique
challenge, especially for younger
players.

 “There can be more distrac-

tions on the road that more expe-
rienced players might be used to,”
Rens said. “I am glad we were able
to begin this season at home so
some of our younger players could
..;,get [to] adapt to collegiate play.”
junior middle blockerjasmine
Dittrich noted that the Panthers
have had the luxury of beginning
the season at home, but the road
trip gives the young team an op-
portunity to grow.
' “It will deﬁnitely be a learn-
ing experience for the freshmen
who have never played at another
college venue,” Dittrich said. “As
veteran players, we have to help

them keep the game in—focus and
play just as if we were defending
our own court.” —

For the Panthers, playing as
they have at home will require a
continued balanced contribution
from the entire team.

“One of our strengths this year
has been that so many players have
stepped up at different times,” head
coach Toby Rens said. ‘_‘It has not
beenjust one player, but an entire
team effort.”

During the opening matches of
the season, the Panthers have had
four different players named to the
all-tournament teams while one
player earned MVP honors.

In the Pitt Panther Invitational,
sophomore Monica Wignot was
named MVP of the tournament
after tallying 43 kills and 29 digs
in four matches. Leggs and junior
Margy Acton earned all-tourna-
ment selections.

Leggs totaled 35 kills and 15
blocks while Acton paced the de-
fensive efforts with an average of

first time

Anthony Gima I Staff Photographer
Juniorjasmine Dittrich (17) and the Pitt Panthers will head to Florida for their ﬁrst away games of the
season. The team is 6-1 at home so far this season.

4.62 digs per set and contributed
seven aces from the serving line.
The most recent University of
Pittsburgh Invitational saw excep-
tional play from junior Dittrich and

freshman setter Lindsey Zitzke,

who earned the honors.

Dittrich led the Panthers with a
.312 hitting percentage and eight
blocks in three matches while Zitz-
ke had 88 assists, 22 digs, ﬁve aces

' and ﬁve blocks on the weekend.

After her ﬁrst week of collegiate
play, Zitzke also earned an addi-
tional honor by being named the
Big East Freshman of the Week.
Wignot was also rewarded for her
play with a spot on the conference
Honor Roll.

The Panthers will play three
matches in the UCF tournament
against UCF (5-1), Florida Atlan-
tic (0-3) and University of North
Carolina, Greensboro (3-4).

“Each of the teams we are play-
ing have a different style, so this
tournament will give us _a wide
range of competition,” Rens said.

“The most compelling match on
paper looks to be against Central
Florida, as they are ' an athletic
team that is capable of matching
our high-speed play.”

Dittrich is also looking forward
to a weekend of high-level volley-
ball‘ on a new court.

“We have been playing at home
in front of our fans, and when we

take on UCF it will be the oppo- ,

site, since we are playing on their
court,” Dittrich said. ,“It is a pres-
sure atmosphere, but if we keep
our focus it can be a chance to get
a big win.”

Central ‘Florida will also be

riding an emotional high, as they '

recently earned their ﬁrst victory
over a ranked opponent when they
defeated No. 3 USC on Sept. 2.

‘ After play in Florida has ended,
the Panthers will return home for
the Pitt Blue and Gold Tournament.
This will be a ﬁnal tune—up oppor-
tunity before the Big East compe-
tition begins at the Field House
against Seton Hall on Sept. 23.

SEC, Big
12 to
mix it up

Donnie Tasser
Staff Writer

Bye, bye, Big 12. Hello super con-
ferences. .

With Texas A&M all but a mem-
ber of the SEC, let’s sit back and
watch the dominoes fall. '

Super conferences were all
the rage about a year ago, when it
appeared the Big Ten would raid
several different conferences the
way the ACC raided the Big East
back in 2004. After the Big Ten
only added one school —— the Big
12’s University of Nebraska —— in-
stead of the previously rumored
several, the talk died down. The
Pac-10 also stole a Big 12 school,
the University of Colorado, (along
with the Mountain West’s Utah) to
become the Paciﬁc. 12. Now, the
Pac-12 has aspirations to become
a 16—team super conference in the
future.

Thanks to A8zM’s desire to
escape the giant shadow cast by
big brother Texas in their current‘
conference -— which, in conjunc-
tion with ESPN, just started the lu-
crative and dominating Longhorn
Network — the school announced
that it intended to leave the Big 12
if invited by another conference.

The obvious choice was the SEC,
and although they were initially re-
luctant, on Tuesday the conference
presidents ofﬁcially invited Texas
A&M —— pending legal action by
any Big 12 school — to be their
13th member. '

The SEC will obviously look
to add another school to reach
an even 14, while the Pac-12 will
continue looking to make their
super conference dream a real-
ity. When that happens, you can
bet that the Big Ten will not be far
behind, and that the ACC (Atlantic
Coast Conference) will also prob-
ably follow suit.

The Big East, like the Big 12,
is in a precarious position. They

Leggs adjusts to
Pittsburgh lifestyle

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

Chipotle and Qdobajust don’t cut it for

California native Kiesha Leggs. While

Pittsburgh prizes its pierogies and
Primanti’s, true Mexican food is a bit
harder to find.

“I’m still looking for a good Mexi-
can restaurant,” Leggs said. “Mexican
food and warm weather — those are
two things I miss about California,” she
added with a laugh- .

Despite the lack of south—of—the-
border cuisine and sunny days, Leggs,
a senior middle hitter for the Panther
volleyball team, has made Pittsburgh
her home for the past two years.

Born in Stockton," Ca1if., Leggs spent
most of her life on the West Coast. She
even began’ her collegiate athletic career
at Sanjoaquin Delta College in Stockton,
where she also played basketball.

But the opportunity to play at a Di-
vision I school drew her to Pitt for her
junior season, and so far Leggs believes
she has made a great decision.

than her height is the way she moves
across the court. While her quickness
and ability to get to the ball are valu-
able, her abilities in the air are just as
startling. Her agility is the result of a
mixed athletics background, one that
gives her the edge over most of her
cornpetitiors. ,
“Playing=different sports shows true
athleticism and a resiliency to phys-i-
cally demanding challenges,” Rens said.
“Kiesha shows those aspects in her vol-
leyball game, especially in herjumping
capability and her intense attitude.”
As one of only two seniors" on this
year’s"squa,d*, Leggs has been a force
in the first matches of the season. She
recorded ‘double—digit kills in four of the

' Panthe,r’s first seven matches, helping

to propel the team to a 6-1 record. Leggs
also earned all-tournament honors at
the Pitt Panther Invitational.

While Leggs does not necessarily set
out to attain individual recognition, she
welcomes the rewards of her efforts on
the court.

“I am always grateful when I receive
acknowledgement for my play,” Leggs

I When I heard from Pitt and visited the

campus and met with the

coaches, Isknew it would be c good fit.
  —Kiesha Leggs   C

but I always aimed high and thought of

myself as a Division I—ca1iber player,”

Leggs said. “When I heard from Pitt
and visited the campus and met with
the coaches, I knew it would be a good
fit.”

According to Pitt head coach Toby
Rens, Leggs has done" more thanjust fit
into the team. This season, she emerged
as a leader and was named a senior cap
tain. '

“Afterjust one season at Pitt, Kiesha‘

has stepped up tremendously and her
progress has been outstanding,” Rens
said. “She is an aggressive player on the
court and has taken on a huge offensive
load for the team.” _ '

At 6-foot-3, Leggs sticks out imme-
diately. The only thing more impressive

’ “I had offers from Division II schools,‘

said. “It’s almost like saying, ‘Thank
you for appreciating my hard work, and
noticing that I was doing well.”’

This year, Leggs has had to expand
her role and take on a more active lead-
ership role on the team, which might
seem daunting for the youngest child
in a family of six. ’

But Leggs admits that when it comes
to her older siblings, she was never
much of a follower. .

“I definitely forged my own path my
whole life,” Leggs said. “I was the differ-
ent one who always had to do the oppo-
site of everyone else —— playingsports in
college, leaving home for school. Being
a leader comes more naturally [to me]
than you might think.”

Leggs in leadership spot  

Volleyball 4 15

Part of her duty as captain is helping
the younger members of the team, and
there are a lot ofinexperienced players
on the 2011 squad. In Pitt’s m.ost recent
victory over Miami (Ohio), four fresh-
men and two sophomores saw playing
time. , ~

Junior Jasmine Dittrich has noticed
Leggs’ commitment to leadership this
season and has seen the benefits al-
ready. ‘

“Kiesha has a lot of responsibility
this yearas a senior captain,” Dittrich
said. “But the greatthing about her is
that she is willing to do whatever is
asked of her, even if it means adjusting

her style of play to fit the team or help— ,

ing out the younger players.” . .
However, Leggs is careful to be more

‘ ofa mentor than another coach.

“IfI notice something on the court,
an opportunity that someone is miss-
in or an ad'ustment that needs to be

8 J

- made, I will point it out,” Leggs said. “If

a younger player seeks out my advice, I
am more than happy to help, but I know
to let the coaches do theirjob.”

As one of those coaches, Rens has

been pleased with Leggs’ ability to lead.

with an on-court example.
“More than anything, Kiesha’s pres-
ence as a middle is what can inspire the

younger players,” Rens said. “They see_ 1

herxplaying with passion and they see
her athleticism, and that motivates them
to improve as Well.”

For fellow middle blocker Jasmine

Dittrich, Leggs’ intensity is definitely

something _she admires.

“Kiesha and I play the same position
sometimes at practice, and watching her
play with emotion and energy is exciting
and inspires me to do the same,” Dittrich
said. “She will make plays that are just
ridiculous and all I can say is that I am_
glad I am only on the opposing team in
practice.”

Those intangible aspects of Leggs’
game come from her background as a
multi-sport athlete. ‘ . ,

Leggs actually started off as a bas-
ketball player, picking up volleyball as

0 a way to stay in shape during the offsea—

son. Soon, however, she realizedthat
volleyball would be her future.

“It was always basketball, basket-
ball, basketball,” Leggs said. “Butonce
I truly learned to appreciate the game
of volleyball and learnedthe strategies
involved, it began to take priority and I
grew to love it.” ‘

Rens is certainly glad she chose vol-
leyball, but he admits that multi-sport
athletes stand out in the recruiting
process.

“She may take a few less elbows in
volleyball than in basketball,” Rens
added jokingly, “but that experience

with physical contact makes her an ag—. ‘

gressive player.”

Perhaps the most telling sign of
Leggs’ commitment to hard work and
physical play for the sake ofher team is
her preference of posting a block over
putting down a kill.

“Getting the kill is nice, but it is more

ofa personal accomplishment that looks '

pretty and makes for a good picture,”

V Leggs said. “But when you can put up
a huge block and shut the otheriteam .

down, that is just a huge motivator for
the whole team that can start a rally. I
would rather have that big block for a

point than a kill any day.”

That statement was a sign to Rens
that Leggs is evolving into a more com-
plete player that can achieve an elite
level.

“The offense stuff, the kills and the
hits, have been Kiesha’s bread and but-
ter and they will always be there,” Rens
said. “Knowing that she is enjoying the
defensive part of her game as well is
great to hear and as a team, we look
forward to those stifling blocks at the
net.”

In a short time, Leggs has made a
name for herself in the Pitt program
while also establishing ties to the larger
Pittsburgh community.

She relishes the friendly atmosphere

'ofthe campus and the entire city, some-

thing she says was lacking in her home-
town of Stockton.

“Back home, everyone drives every-
where and ifyou saw someone walking
around, you wondered what was go-
ing on,” she said. “Here, it seems like
people —-— and students, especially — are
always outside, engaging in some sort
of activity. I like being part of that ac-
tive scene.”

Of course, being away from her fam-

ily is difficult at times. Leggs also ac-

knowledges that Pitt “does not have even

one game close to California,” and she
misses her siblings.
“It is hard to be so far from home and

the things that are familiar —— but our

team is so close that it is like a second
family,” Leggs said. “We love to hang out
after practice and go to movies or out
to dinner as a group. We are friends in
addition tolteammates.”

This season, the Panthers have been
successful early on, thanks in part to -
V Leggs and her performance. Still, she

is far from satisfied.

“My main goal for the team is to win
the Big East title,” Leggs said. “Person—
ally, I want to be the player that other

teams notice before they play Pitt. I _

want to be recognized as a force to be
taken seriously.”

Missouri to
follow A&N|
to the SEC

Tasser 1 14

cannot hope to add Division I schools in
football without destroying their beloved
basketball conference, and their schools will
be tempted by lucrative offers from other
conferences. After these hypothetical raids,
they could realistically merge‘ and become
their own super conference (what would
they call such a geographically ridiculous
conference?) but only time will tell .what’s
in store for these two.

When the dust settles, I see Oklahoma
and Oklahoma State jumping ship to the Pac-
12 and Missouri following A&M to the SEC.
That would effectively spell out the end of

 

The SEC might come
calling, but probably

only for the likes of
Louisville or 

   

the Big 12, with the other six teams opting
for a way out instead of an expansion. Texas
would no doubt be the biggest catch, but
remember, kids: It’s all about the Benjamins.
If they could make more money on their own
as an independent a la Notre Dame rather
than revenue share in say, the Big Ten, ‘you
better believe that they won’t hasten to join
anyone.

So where does that leave the Big East?

' They could try and make it on their own as

a basketball conference, but methinks some
very important members may jump ship,
no matter what their high—proﬁle basket-

ball coach says. The basketball—only schools ~ ‘

could form a basketball—only conference,

‘ with the other schools being split between

the Big 10 and ACC. The SEC might come
calling, but probably. only for the likes 0
Louisville or WVU. *

Will any of this happen quickly? Maybe,
maybe not. With this much money in play,
the conferences will act cautiously until one
of them “mans up” and makes the jump to
16 teams (my money is on the ambitious
Pac-12). Then, the rest will scramble to do
the same. A crazy time in college sports is
upon us, and I have a feeling it’s going to be
a lot more fun than last summer’s uninspir-
ing rumor-fest. ﬁ
