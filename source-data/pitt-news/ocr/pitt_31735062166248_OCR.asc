Public Affairs

 To Be Taught

In New School

A new Graduate School of
Public Affairs to “meet the
need for more qualiﬁed peo-
ple on the leadership level in
public service” will be estab-
lished and be in limited opera-

tion in the 1957-58 academic year.
~ "“*e announcement was made

\ by Chancellor Edward H. Litch-

ﬁeld in an address before the Pitts-
burgh Press Club and the local
chapter of the Public Relations
Society of America.

The University is now look-
ing for a full time professional
faculty and for a Dean to head —
the school and help organize the
program. The existing Institute
of Local Government will prob-
ably be incorporated into, the
new school, stated Dr. Litch-
field.

“The primary function of the

school,” the Chancellor said, “will

be the training of administrators
of such areas in public manage-

i"”Inent as welfare, recreation, plan-

ning, safety, conservation, educa-
tion, public health, engineering,
and voluntary community serv-
ices.” But this will not preclude
the training of generalists who
deal with many areas of public
service rather than with speciﬁc
functions, he added. .
“The school will be at thec
fully graduate level because its
success in producing leaders
will depend somewhat on se-
lecting students who already
have a broad educational back-
ground on which to base this
special advanced professional

 training,” continued Dr. Litch-
5 ﬁeld. “This background may be

in liberal arts, or in prior pro-
fessional training such as engi-
neering, social work, or public
health.”

and for governmental and com-

munity agencies in addition to
instruction for degree candidates.
It will avoid as far as possible
duplication of courses now offered
by the University.

Dr. Litchﬁeld added that joint
appointments among the Graduate
School of Public Health and other
schools of the University would
be desirable if care is taken to
insure a proper balance between
the professional and disciplinary
interests of the appointees.

EnrollmentApplications
To End on January 15

The University of Pittsburgh has set earlier deadlines
by which it must have applications for admission from stu-
dents who wish to enroll in the University.

‘Dr. Charles H. Peake, assistant chancellor of student

affairs, announced the new and earlier deadlines recently.

He explained that it was necessary to move the dates for-
ward to allow time to process 21116

applications and to set up the}
proper number of classes prior tol
the opening of the new semestersl

Under the revised schedule of‘
deadlines, those applying for ad-
mission to the University for the
1957 spring semester must do so
before Jan. 15. Applications for
the summer school sessions must
be turned in before June 1, and

‘S’ AWARD

Applicatlpns for the ‘S’
Award will remain available
until Jan. 16. The ‘S’ Award
provides a summer in Europe
for an outstanding man at the
end of his junior year. Al-
though IF provides the funds
for the award, no stipulation is
made that this man must be a
member of a fraternity. Past
recipients are’Don Gartner and

Bob McCabe. ‘

those for the 1957 fall semester
must be received by Aug. 15.

The newly established dates ap-
ply to incoming freshmen, trans-
fers, and those planning to enter
part-time as special, non-degree,
or graduate students. .

Any applications received after
the date established for the par-
ticular session for which admission
was sought‘ will be automatically
considered for the following ses-
sion. .

Dr. Peake emphasized that re-
ceipt of an application prior to the
deadline does not mean that the
applicant will be admitted. He
pointed out that the number pf
students which can be accepted at
Pitt is not unlimited, but that
enrollment must be conﬁned with-
in bounds imposed by building-

capacity. by availability of facili- _

ties and equipment, and by the

. size of the faculty. ..

“M” On Campus Mata

(Author of "Bare/oat Boy With Cheek,” etc.)

EAT, DRINK, AND BE MARRIED

On a recent tour of seven million American colleges,
I was struck by two outstanding facts: ﬁrst, the great
number ofwstudents who smoke Philip Morris; and second,
the great number of students who are married.

The ﬁrst phenomenon -the vast multitude of Philip
Morris smokers—- comes as no surprise, for what could
be more intelligent than to smoke Philip Morris? After
all, pleasure is what you smoke for, and pleasure is what
Philip Morris delivers. Try one. Light up and see for
yourself.  Or, if you like, don’t light up. Just take
a Philip Morris, unlighted, and puff a couple of times.
Get -that wonderful ﬂavor? You bet you do! Even with-
out lighting you can taste Philip Morris’s ﬁne natural
tobacco. Also, you can make your package of Philip
Morris last practically forever. 4

No, I say, it was not the great number of Philip
Morris smokers that astounded me; it was the great
number of married students. Latest statistics show that
at some coeducational col1eges,'the proportion of married
undergraduates runs as high as twenty per cent! And,
what is even more startling, fully one-quarter of these
marriages have been blessed with tissue!

Now, to the young campus couple who are parents
for the ﬁrst time, the baby is likely to be a source of con-
siderable worry. Therefore, let me devote today’s column
to a few helpful hints on the care of babies.

First of all, we will take up the matter of diet. In
the past, babies were raised largely on table scraps. This,
however, was outlawed by the Smoot-Hawley Act, and
today babies are fed a scientiﬁc formula consisting of
dextrose, maltose, distilled water, evaporated milk, and
a twist of lemon" peel.

After eating, the baby tends to grow sleepy. A lullaby
is very useful to help it fall asleep. In case you‘d0n’t
know any lullabies, make one up. For example:

Go to sleep, my little infant, _
’ Goo-goo moo-moo poo-poo binfant.

A baby sleeps‘ best on its stomach, so place it that way
in its crib. Then to make sure it will not turn itself over
during the night, lay a soft but fairly heavy object on its
back—- another baby, for instance. 1

    

'a”//-W-ire//3-’///2’?/€,~ﬁM/74’ 2/r74/name.

So, as you see, raising a baby is no great problem.
All you need is a little patience and a lot of love. Also
diapers, rompers, soakers, crib, mattress, sheets, bumpers,
blankets, high chair, diapers, talcum, baby oil, ﬁsh liver
oil, paregoric, diapers, safety pins, cotton, cotton covered
toothpicks, bottles, diapers, nipples, diapers, bottle
brushes, booties, diapers, nighties, wrappers, diapers,
rattles, teething rings, paciﬁers, diapers, and unlimited
funds‘ ©Max Shulman, 1956
When Baby is fast asleep - the little angel! - why not relax
and give yourself a treat? With Philip Morris, of corris!

Chemicals To Modify Raiati

Young Biophysicist
Reports on 3-Year
Study in Europe

By mv JAQoBs
Seated at a table in the bio-"'
physics lab, your reporter
joined the youngish—looking

er of unusual beverages. That
the concoction was tea and

not a sample of tobacco moisaic
was quickly assured by the re-
sourceful Dr. Charley Brinton,
combination s cientist, a t h 1 e t e,
bachelor, and good humor man.

He had recently returned from

Europe, the 30-year-old Doctor of
Biophysics reported. Leaving Pitt
in the fall of 1953 on the verge of
receiving his doctorate, he headed
for Paris, France, on the wings of
a French government scholarship
and a Fullbright travel grant.

At the Radiation Institute in
Paris, he conducted research on
the mechanism of radiation dam-
age in living tissue. His contribu-
tion included original work on
.science’s present theory relating
such damage to the action of free
chemical radicals. Ultimately, he
suggested, this work will lead to
the development of chemical pro-
tection against the eﬁects of radi-
ation in humans. ,

Working on this project had the
unusual twist of calling for “bio-
physical athletes.” To test the
effect of cosmic rays on mutation,
Dr. Brinton and his colleagues
tackled the job of climbing Mount
M 0 n t bl a n c, Europe’s highest
mountain in the French Alps.
They left samples of bacteria at
the summit for long-term expos-
ure. Unfortunately, he laughed,
that project failed, for the samples
-had disappeared when they came
back to recover them.

But Europe had other more re-
vfﬁding challenges to the versa-
tile Dr. Brinton. During his Paris
study, he made various trips
around the continent, giving guest
lectures on his work at various
biological society meetings. In ad-
dition, his athletic prowess con-
tributed to a well-rounded Eu-
ropean stay. He played on a stu-
dent basketball team that won the
student championship of Paris,
and thereafter traveled about the
country meeting various intercol-
legiate competition.

Student college activities are
somewhat different from those at
American universities, he observ-

teams, but rather they choose a

representative team "through a
well-organized intramural com-
petition.

Also, there are no fraternities,
or sororities throughout Europe.
The universities themselves plan
many student events, especially
outdoor activities -— like mountain
climbing parties.

After two years at Paris, Dr.

LATE DATE WITH A BIRTH RATE

UNIOR’S driving the combine tonight. He’s got a date

with the 10,753 new Americans who’ll be born by next
sundown. A birth rate that has upped our population 30
million since 1940-while 2 million farmers have left the
farm for other jobs.

How can 2 million fewer farmers feed 30 million more
people? Machines--millions of them—are the answer. To-
day’s farmer still has to work late when his crops are
ready. But “hired hands” of steel enable him to produce

The University’s sororities and fraternities are, offering »

the entire student body enjoyable entertainment in the form
of the 1957 Greek Week activities. An outstanding program
planned by the Greek Week Committee includes the Greek
Sing, being held in the Commons Room,.the Chariot Race,
being run at the Schenley Park Oval, and Jazz Concerts,
being held in local fraternity houses. Although participa-

' tion is limited tomembers of campus fraternities and sorori-

ties every student is encouraged to attend.

With the openingof Greek Week an opportunity is
made available for all members of the University to better
acquaint themselves with each other. This is not only an
opportunity for fraternities and sororities to better ac-
quaint themselves with each other but also for the indepen- A
dent students of ‘the University to join in closer fellowship.

Climaxing this important University Week will be a
dance held in the Commons Room. Every student is invited
to the dance. Let us all support Greek Week and encourage
fellowship among the student body.

Merry Christmas

Public communications and the commercial world over-

dar the date we know as Christmas, December 25, ‘arrives’

two weeks later on January 7.

The difference of two weeks was caused by the revision
of the calendar from Roman times by Pope Gregory. The ,

A Nostalgic Feeling    .  *

Let's Be Serious

By Irv Rothmon

I.-Ialf-time ceremonies at the Miami game gave
us a nostalgic’ feeling. The Homecoming Queen
presented in regal robes on a gaudy ﬂoat and sur-
rounded by ladies—in- waiting reminded us of Pitt’s
grandiose ceremony to honor the outstanding Senior
woman-Coronation.

But there is a basic difference between the two
ceremonies. Miami’s ceremony - ~ -
during the festive football game
is merry, light-hearted, in line
with the‘ light-headed affairs of
the day. The gaudier and _more
expensive the ceremony, the bet-
ter show—loving fans like it.

Pitt's display is intended to
be serious.

Our ﬂowered. halls, royal
robes, ladies and attendants—in- ' Q
waiting wait each June to honor as,the Queen the
person who represents the ideal Pitt Senior woman.
She is recognized for high character, academic
achievement, and extra-curricular accomplishment.

 

Important Purpose ' .

In actuality, she represents the ideal woman in
the same manner as -the male awardee represents
that type of well—rounded person the University
seeks to produce, this an important manifestation

of University ideals.

Unfortunately, although the Senior Queen repre-
sents academic achievement in its broadest sense,
the sense of half-time glitter of Homecoming cere-
monies has inﬂuenced the manner in which she is
honored. .

The June ceremony is given dignity by having
it modeled after the British Coronation-—but what-
ever_ allegorical intentions there are, they are over-
shadowed by glitter and gloss_and manifestations

  
   

 

of a way of life that has never been fostered as
ideal in an American educational institution.

Static and Nebulous

But more anathema than the dated costuming
is the static quality of the presentation. For more
than two decades‘ Senior Queens and their courts
have been reciting the same speeches written by
some nebulous soul whose prose was often good.

It should be obvious that Senior Queens each _\
year should have something new to say, words
more to their listeners than trite speeches—-especial-
ly in this institution. How refreshing it would be
to abandon this model British ceremony! (It can
hardly be considered a British contribution to the
American way of life.) M

But lest we criticize destructively to seem icono-
clastic, may we offer in exchange the\American

custom—the digniﬁed, informal, but often erudite ‘
banquet. ‘

Subsidizing" Coeds

For those who feel that the cost of the banquet
might prevent some women attending, we suggest
a means to subsidize banquet costs.

The money now spent for Coronation-golden-_
programs, handsomely engravel invitations, rib-
boned necklaces strung with the Queen’s photo,
ﬂowers strewn by herb-bearers and those placed
throughout the Commons Room, maintenance per-
sonnel who set up platforms and curtains for the
affair, and other miscellaneous details--might just
as well be used to defer banquet costs. ‘

It is not too soon to consider these necessary

changes in the annual program to honor the very
important Senior Queen. '

Chancellor Litchﬁeld will be ofﬁcially inaugu-
rated in June; competition from an out—mioded
Coronation is unreasonable in light of his progres-
sive aims. .

U. s. Walking somy   T
Commies Stay Home

By Ed Bochmon

"The Free World should stand
up and applaud the “Eisenhow-

_ er Doctrine,” aimed toward Iron .

Curtain eagerness last week.

This policy, directed at the com-
munist nations, -
has great im-
p o r t a n c e of
both near—and
far ——" reaching
signiﬁcance.

T h e United
States has been
often justly ac-
cused of having
li t t l e or no
foreign policy,
but this latest
repre-
sents one V of the greatest ad-

vancementsin U.S. foreign pol-

icy for many decades.

This new “Doctrine” has been
aimed at’ the often-troubled
Middle Eastern area. The policy
states the fact that any nation
in that area which is attacked by
the Communists would receive
immediate U.S. armed aid if

such a request is made by the
attacked government. At this
writing, Eisenhower is seeking
Congressional authority to make
such an immediate move should
the occasion arise. Ike also wants
to draft a new program of eco-
nomic aid for the Middle East
to build up its stability and anti-
Communist potential.

Congressional Approval
,If the president gets the ex-

pected Congressional approval,

it will amount to muwch the same
power "he was granted in 1955,
when his decision to defend For-
mosa by force, if necessary, was

~upheld. Formosa, then a hot-
bed of danger, has had full sec-
urity now that our naval ships
are patroling the area.

The timing of this new policy
is perfect. For never has U.S.
prestige been as high in the
Middle Eastern area as it is now.
This came about when our na-
tion upheld the moral right of
condemning aggression t h e r e
last October. We won many
friends when we were forced to
knock our allies — Great Bri-
tain, France and Israel —- for
their actions in Egypt.

The timing of Ike’s announce-

 

ment is right, also, for the Mid-
dle East eagerly needs a new
voice of authority now that Bri-
tain has lost so much face there.
World Opinion \ L r

And not to be overlooked in
the timing is the fact that world

opinion is so against the Soviet A

Union now, for their bloody
butchery in Hungary. I

The Middle East, with its rich
oil ﬁelds, has long been an object
of desire for the Communists,
and they would eagerly welcome
any opening to get control of
that area. That opening cannot
come or it would be a devastat-
ing blow to the West. So a move

‘had to be played, and Ike played

a powerful hand. -

One of the biggestaces in this
hand which we hold is the U.S.
Navy’s Sixth Fleet‘. This force,
commanded by Vice Admiral
Charles Randall (“Cat”) Brown,
contains a well-trained group of
40,000 men, who are patrolling
th e Mediterranean Sea area
around the clock. They are gear-
ed to a state of “instant readi-
ness,” and are ready for any
land, sea or air diﬁiculties which
could arise in the Middle East.

Aircrott Carrier
And soon to join the Sixth

.. Fleet, late this month, is the big-

gest aircraft carrier the world
has seen to date, the‘ 60,000 ton
USS Forrestal. On the Forrestal
will be the deadly Douglas A3D
Skywarrior, a 600-m.p.h. twin-
jet bomber with a range than
can reach all the way to Moscow,
if necessary, from anywhere in
the Eastern Mediterranean.

In addition to the Forrestal,
the Sixth Fleet has a wide range
of carriers with atom-armed
planes, missile ships, cruisers,
destroyers and a Marine amphi-
bious unit.

Yes, it is a powerful force,
powerful not only in what it is

capable of doing but powerful

in threat. As Admiral Brown
says, “We can exert flexible
force tailored to ﬁt any situation.
We can raise our voice without
shouting. And without ﬁring a
shot. we can create terriﬁc reper-
cussions.”

So the Soviets have to take

 

things.

notice, and are well aware of‘

what they -would face should

they decide to’ get reckless  

the Middle East. The U.S. Sixth
Fleet is a mighty talking point
for a strong “Eisenhower Doc-
trine.”

Letters To ,  
The Editor

Editor, the Pitt News

Pitt is entering into a new era
with new officials, new buildings,
and new ideas. We are rapidly...
progressing towards becoming one
of the ﬁnest universities in the
United States. There are some‘
traditions which we will keep and
many which we discard in this
process of change. And an evalu-
ation should be made by every
student as to the things he wants
to keep and as to the things he
wants to discard or to add. The
incident which provokes me to
write this letter is trivial but
nevertheless exempliﬁes the type
of attitude that I would not like to
see continue at Pitt. ‘

Some weeks ago, a Negro sor-
ority and fraternity had an affair
in the Social Room of the Stephen
Foster Memorial. This affair was
attended not only by Pitt students
but by other young men and wo-
men as well. It was chaperoned by
a university official. A fair young

Negro, after he had checked his
coat, was approached by the offi-

cial who asked him if he were in
the right place. What the official
meant was apparent; and the
young man was amazed and em-
barrassed. A fraternity man ex-
plained that the young man had
been invited and that he was a
Negro. Would it have made a dif-
ference had he been of another

race?

This incident in itself is of little
consequence but the principle is

important. This is a new era. And
if we are to succeed in making
Pitt a ﬁne University, we must

change attitudes as well asiother

Sincerely. / i ’

Local Explorers
Scale Snowtopped
lxtaccihuatl Peak

By ESTHER MISHELEVICH

A, rising Pitt student,
George Giles, Col. ’59/, ascend-
ed 17,430 ft. to the summit of
Ixtaccihuatl,
mountain of Mexico. This ac-
complishment climaxed his
two and a half month Yucatan
Expedition with the Explorer’s
Club of Pittsburgh.

On Aug. 10, 1956, at 5:30 a.m.
he and three companions began to
hike from the base of lxtaccihuatl
to, the snowline ten miles above.

‘T George noted that this mountain
is known as the “Sleeping Wo-
man” because the outline of its
peaks resembles a woman lying
on her back, and part of the snow-
line looks like her hair.

Avalanches Dangerous

The men pushed on past the
snowline. The climb was exhaust-
ing. Steep a-valanche slopes were
dangerous. “I still shake when I
think about it,” George said, his
broad smile fading for a minute.

.“I-Iowever, there were no mis-
chaps.”

croppings and ridges. “We used
a speciﬁc pace, pausing only for
momentary rests. With each
step, feet felt heavier and heav-
ier.”

Even near the top, however, the
men could not be sure of their
exact destination, for they did not
know which one of the peaks com-
prising lxtaccihuatl was the true
summit. They tried four different
peaks, and ﬁnally only George
and Ivan Jirak, a student in Pitt
night school, decided to continue
the climb.

At 3:35 p.m., George and Ivan
reached the true summit. “There
was little conversation when we

arrived,” George said. “I think

They didn’t stay long. After
leaving a record tube of their
climb, they started back down
the mountain. The distance
from the snowline to the sum-
mit which had been covered in
four hours on the way up only
took half as long on the way
down.

The difference in time was the
result of different methods; in-
stead of climbing down the men

Usually such an ascent takes two
or three days, because the climb-
ers stop to make camps.

Of their success in reaching I
the summit, George said, “It
makes you feel as if you’ve ac-
complished. something as an in-
dividual.” He added that Ixtac-
cihuatl is not underestimated
when referred to as the “tough-
est mountain” in Mexico.

While George gained much sat-
isfaction from the summer’s ex-
pedition, he lost twenty pounds
(which he has since gained back).
It wasn’t his appetite, though. At
high altitudes, where a candy bar
is a filling meal, George also ate
a half can of Spam, two canned
biscuits, and a half box of raisins.

Since he joined the Explorers
Club of Pgh., mountain climbing
has been first among George’s in-
terests. Caving comes next. He
went climbing in Wyoniing the
summer before he attempted Ix--
taccihuatl, and now he anticipates
1958, when he hopes to join an
expedition to Angel Falls.

 Tomorrow Night

By ED KOLTISKA

After a shaky ﬁrst half in
which loose play and loose
balls represented a see-saw
score, the Panthers ﬁnally
settled down and played a
steady brand of basketball to
defeat Lafayette 69-59.

With one minute remaining in
the ﬁrst half and the Jungle Cats
trailing 31-30, Coach Bob Tim-
mons’ ﬂoormen put on a 55-second
freeze before John Riser deliv-
ered aﬁeld goal to put the Pan-
thers ahead, 32-31, at the buzzer.

Bob Lazor opened up the second
half with four quick ﬁeld goals
while Jules Pegues added one to
put the locals ahead 42-30. It took
Lafayette eight minutes and the
sharp shooting of James Radcliﬁ
and Stewart Murray to tie the
Panthers at 52-52.

Hursh Finally Scores

‘Don Hennon broke the tie with
‘a driving lay-up and then added
two,more ﬁeld goals to keep the
locals ahead of the visitors. Lafay-
ette trailed closely with Anthony
Mack and Bob Mantz connecting
from the outside._

With only a few minutes re-
maining in the game, Chuck
Hursh picked up his first ﬁeld
goai and foul of the game to
give the Panthers an eight-point
lead.

Misses by Lafayette enabled Ris-
er “and Hennon to add’ a couple
of baskets before the ﬁnal buzzer
to put the Oaklanders ahead by
ten points, 69-59.

West Virginia Next.

In their seventh win, Lazor took
scoring honors with 20 points fol-
lowed closely by Pegues and Hen-
non who had 18 and 16 respective-
ly.

Coach Timmons will undoubt-
edly stress a tighter defense in
preparation for the West Vir-
ginia tilt scheduled for tomor-
row night at the Field House.«
The starting time is 8:30 p.m.

the nation’s most colorful collegi-
ate ball handler, will lead the
high-scoring Ridgerunners.

Hundley vs. Hennon

Hundley, who made everyone’s
All-American second team last
year, is almost assured of ﬁrst
team honors this year as he re-
writes the Mountaineer record
book for the second straight year.

Last Saturday night, Hundlcy
set an all-time Mountaineer rec-
ord for a single-game high of 54
points against Furman. “He can
do more things better than any,
other player in college basket-
ball,” exclaimed Coach Fred
Schaus of West Virginia.

Basketball fans will have their
ﬁrst opportunity to see two sharp-
shooters vie against one another
in Hundley and Hennon. Hennon
is the leading Panther scorer with
218 points in eleven games.

Frosh F loormen Drop

Tech,   67- 64

By MIKE GERBER

On Saturday evening the previously undefeated fresh-
man cagers of Carl Peterson dropped their ﬁrst game of the
season to the Carnegie Tech Junior Varsity. The ﬁnal score
was 67 to 64 in favor of the Plaid. The contest was played as

«a preliminary to the tilt betweene

Carnegie Tech and Penn State at
the Skibo Gymnasium.

The game needed an overtime
period before the Tech Jayvees
ﬁnally emerged as winners. It was
a close one all the way. The score
was often tied, and the lead
changed hands many times, with
ﬁrst one team and then the other
forging ahead. At the end of re-
gulation time the score was all
even at 60-60.

But in the ﬁve minute overtime
period the Tartans took advantage
of their foul shot opportunities
and outscored the Panther Cubs
seven points to four to emerge the
Winners, 67-64.

Mandish Stars

The Tech Jayvees, who used
several varsity second stringers in
gaining their victory, were led by

_ George Skalka and Frank Wes-

lowski who scored 18 and 15
points respectively.

Skalka canned ten of 14 free
throws and was especially tough
in the overtime period. _Weslow-
ski proved a tough man to han-
dle from the ﬁeld as he dropped
in seven ﬁeld goals, mostly on
jump shots.

The big guns for the Panther
Cubs were forward John Man-
dish, the game’s high scorer, and

guard Tom Maloney, both of
whom sparkled in the losing
cause.

Masseri Stopped
Mandish, who has shown a lot

points to lead the Blue and Gold
frosh. Mandish’s scoring came on
eight ﬁeld goals, and ﬁve free
throws. The Panther eager also
rebounded very well.

,Maloney was very effective
from the outside, scoring sixteen
points on seven ﬁeldigoals and a
pair of free throws.

Gene Masseri, who had been
the team’s leading scorer, was
bottled up by the Tartan’s Boyd
Doxtader and could score only
six points. I ‘

Swim Tough NC State Tonight

By MURRAY CHASS _

The Panther swimmers, who dropped their opening meet
to Rutgers last Saturday afternoon, face another rough test
tonight when they swim against North Carolina State at 8
p.m. in the Pittsburgh Athletic Association pool.

Unlike the local mermen, the¢'

the outstanding
feature of the meet.
Two more interesting races

should develop in the 200—yard
butterﬂy and N200-yard breast-
stroke, two events in which
North Carolina State has the
NCAA champion, Ed Fadgen. _

Although Fadgen is the logical
choice to win in both, the Panther
aces in those races will be out to
upset the defending champ. In the
butterfly, Bernie Bauer, a senior,
will give the Wolfpack star a
tough ﬁght while Ed Robson,
only a junior, is expected to make
it close in the breaststroke.

Last year the Panthers met the
Wolfpack in their second meet or
the season, just as they do to-
night, and themermen from State
came out on top, 51-33.

It Coach Ben Grady is cor-
rect, tonight’s result may not
be any different. After the meet
with Rutgers, Grady said, “It’s

Matmen Outclass

Big Ten Champs
By CHRIS _GILLOTTI

Coach Rex Peery’s wrestlers,
the only Pitt team that’s not
out to improve last year’s rec-
ord (they were 10-0 in dual
meet competition), started the
season off on the right foot as
they crushed Michigan, 25-3, at
the Field House Saturday.

In the 123-pound class Bill
Hulings had a tough time with
Dan Deppe, the third ranked
man in his class in the Big Ten,
before pulling out a 2-0 win. It
was a particulrly satisfying vic-
tory for Hulings as Deppe pin-
ned him in 1955, thelast time
Michigan was here.

National champion Ed Peery had
little trouble gaining his 34th win
as he easily defeated Larry Mur-
ray, 6-0, at 130 pounds.

At 137 pounds, Lloyd Hamady

I scored the ﬁrst point against the

Blue and Gold as he managed an
escape from Vic DeFelice, but
DeFelice, who came in third in
the nationals last ‘year left little
doubt as to whom was the better
man, decisioning Hamady, 4-1. P
Lock Haven’s Bob Bubb, act-
ing the part of a good host de-
cided to show off the Field
House lighting system to’ his
147 p o u n d opponent, Rich
Schneider, andso oblingly pin-
ned him with a half-nelson and
crotch in, the second period.
The father of Bob Weber, Mich-
igan’s l57—pound foe of Bob Rich-
ardson, is the freshman football
coach at Michigan, but Richardson
did‘ all the teaching on the mat as
he gave Weber a lesson in wrest-
ling for a 5-0 win. It was Rich-
ardson’s ﬁrst win,in dual meet
competition.

The lone Michigan victory came_

.-r-*

in the 167-pound class as Jack
Marchello, Big Ten champ, squeez-
ed out a close decision over Dave
John, 5-3.
At 177 pounds, Tom Alberts
_ had little trouble with Karl
Lutomski, running up an early
7-0 lead. Then in the second
frame, thinking Ltomski might
be jealous’ of his teammate, Al-
berts kindly exhibited the ceil-
ing to'him with a ﬁgure four
head-scissors. '
Heavyweight Ron Schirf had to
come from behind to defeat Ru-

Backfielcl Dynamo I

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

V

Sports Editor

Now that Jacksonville has returned to normal life after
the hectic Gator Bowl thriller between Pitt and Georgia Tech,

,t1iére.remains only two unanswered questions relative to

these two teams. First, what does it take to ‘beat a speedy
team like Tech in a bowl? Secondly, why did the Panthers fail to
avenge the Sugar Bowl defeat in the rematchfor which they so

eagerly waited a long year.

Answering the ﬁrst automatically qualiﬁes one as some sort of
a football genius. They are in great demand by the Yellow Jackets
regular season foes, too. Any expended effort about the second puzzler
L‘-will be labeled the usual second guess. Even the most rabid and
-disturbed Panther partisans must ﬂatly admit that Coach Bobby
Dodd’s gridders had it when they needed it and rightly deserved to
win. Football games are won on the ﬁeld.

You can’t ignore a team accustomed to losing the statistics

which continues to win theibig ones.

Eight teams have tried

to defeat Dodd in ya post-season classic and eight have failed.
The Yellow Jacket mentor is the undisputed king of the bowl
coaches. One of these days, though, the Ramblin’ Wreck is going
to experience the mixed emotions”"when you drop a bowl tilt.
4 It was felt with conﬁdence that the Jungle Cats would be the
.eleven to puncture Tech’s bowl balloon. I
They had a big, powerful line; a second forward wall that was
more than adequate; and a host of hard-running backs. Just as
..._Dodd ﬁgured it——much to the locals’ chagrin-—his Yellow Jackets
were victorious though outplayed. Alert defensive play, overall
team speed and swift backs, coupled with a few breaks, spelled the

difference.

, Anything advanced will be termed an alibi or an excuse. The
grandstand coaches came up with their usual: Why didn’t Ralph
Jelic(10-66) and Jim Theodore(3-34) carry the ball more often in
the late stages of the game since they were having success in run-

ning against the Tech line?

Why didn’t they use Joe Walton as a

decoy instead of making him the central target for passes when he

was ‘guarded so closely?

Answers to these have been tossed back and forth and up
and down. There’s one more aspect -which merits more atten-
tion, possibly the latent reason for the setback. It is unques-
tionable that the Panthers badly need a breakaway halfback who
can go all the way on a given play and change the complexion
of a tight contest with one terriﬁc burst of speed.

If Coach John ‘Michelosen had had one such ball carrier to use

in the Gator Bowl the Panthers may have been returned the victor.
Even if Michelosen comes up with another strong outﬁt next season
he is going to need an explosive scatback to keep the defense

honest. ~

Actually“ Pitt has not had a proliﬁc breakaway runner since

Gibby Welch in the late 1920’s.

The closest thing to Welch-was

Lou Cimarolli. It will take a lot of searching before Skyscraper U.

discovers another back -who can start as fast as Cimarolli.

Give

Michelosen a halfback with the elusiveness of a*Welch and the
take-off velocity of a Cimarolli and the Panthers will surprise quite
a few next season. What we need is a “gridiron dynamo.”

Halfback Dick Bowen was no more than one foot away

from the ground when he made his sensational catch for the
Panthers’ first touchdown with’ 16 seconds left in the second
quarter of the Gater Bowl. In fact, there are some people

that witnessed _ the tussle who0 ‘

claim that Bowen’s elbows were
touching the turf, which all the
more goes to show what a great
catch it was.

Newspapers in Atlanta, home of
the Engineers, should be given
a lesson in how to be a little less
partial when it comes to writing
about their team. Quite a few
articles were printed prior to and
after the game that Bobby Dodd
himself couldn’t have nerve
enough to say or write. One
sportswriter,‘ in a story a few
days before the game, had the

f o 1 l ow i n g gem: “Jacksonville

realized its fondest dream today
when the Georgia Tech football
team arrived in that city.”
* ‘-16 =1:
Photographers, who are al-
ways looking for good shots of
the head coaches during a big
game, were frustrated in their
efforts to do such with Johnny
 -Michelosen. Rare are the times
that the expression on big
Mike’s face changes, and this
the cameramen discovered much
to their disgust. One photog-

 

 

rapher‘ forgot about the game
and concentrated on the Panther
"mentor for the latter part of the
third quarter and the beginning
of the fourth, but came up with
nothing different than the very
ﬁrst one he snapped.
* 1: at

Spectators never get in on the
ridiculous happenings in the press
box during a game. For instance,
amidst all the excitement of the
Gator Bowl,‘ a few phone calls
came into the press box that are
worth telling about. One woman
called after the game had pro-
gressed about ﬁve minutes and
wanted to know if a group of pa-
trol boys she was in charge of
could be admitted into the game

at no cost. Another member of the

same sex waited until midway
through the contest and then in-
quired of the working press via
telephone, “Has the game started
already?” When informed that it
had, the gal with the sweet, so-
prano voice asked further, “Will
there be another game tomorrow?”
With this, we let the'Gator Bowl

rest in peace.

'_ was all but forgotten.

The Panthers "amazingly struck

Ralph Jelic, Salvaterra, and Dick.

the game’s top ground gainer with
66 yards (58 in the ﬁrst half), ran
30 yards to the Tech 36, and three
plays later ‘Salvaterra uncorked
his 42-yard pass to Bowen r who

took a two-touchdown lead -when
Paul Rotenberry tallied after
Wes Gibbs recovered the Pan-

utes later the unpredictable
Salvaterra sneaked one yard for
the score that capped a 70-yard‘

were on the Tech 36; but those
36 wereptoo much to travel, and
the rematch was merely a se-
quel to the original.

pick only four out of twelve

however, is in line with his ad-

with ridiculous records of 6-6.
