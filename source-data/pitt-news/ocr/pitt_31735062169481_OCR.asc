New S G Head, Stresses

Representation, Involvement

by DAN BOOKER
Ken Frederick, newly — elected
Student Government (SG) presi-
dent, called on SG to take a “pos-

, itive, dynamic, and rational ap-

proach” to representation of stu-
dent interests in his inaugural ad-
dress Wednesday at the SG ban-
quet. He announced that, before
the ﬁrst SG meeting, SG officials
would be available to discuss with
interested students the problems
and proposals facing University
students. ’

The new Senate's ﬁrst meeting
is set for Thursday, Feb. 16, at
7 p.m. in the SU Supper Room.
If students respond to the open
discussion session, Frederick com-
mented that he would like to see
it become a tradition.

This proposal by Frederick was
almost a response to a challenge
issued by retiring Pr.e_S,i,dent Ralph
Manning to seek “the achieve-
ment of greater student involve
ment” at the highest goal of the
new SG. '

Manning deﬁned student in-
volvement as “not simply stu-
dents addressing envelopes when
secretaries do not have the time.
It is the creation of a mature,
responsible, and rational student
body capable of governing itself
in an atmosphere not charged
with emotionalism but dedicated
to clear-headed action.”

To Manning’s invocation that
SG “must be able to continually
assess the needs of the students,”
Frederick remarked in his speech
that he and the new Vice-presi-

UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

 

dent, Tom Meisner, would have
regular office hours during the
week to discuss the problems and
ideas that the senators encoun-.
ter daily. A '

This would also be a chance
todiscuss ideas of the executive
with the senators, noted Freder-
ick. “Together, we can increase
the role of the students in the
decision-making process,” he said
in a direct statement to the new
senators.

Frederick used allocation of
ftmds to student organizations as
an example of an area where the
student.voice must be maintain-
ed, despite recent -action that has
removed the student activities
fee.

Mrs. Donna Allen, national
legislative representative of
the Committee to Abolish
the House Un-American Ac-
tivities Committee» (HUAC-),

attacked the House commit- A

tee, in a University address
Wednesday, as being “four-square
against” an atmosphere of free
speech and association on college
campuses. Mrs. Allen's speech
was sponsored _by Students for
Peace.

Mrs. Allen discussed the pos-
sibility of HUAC subpoening col-
lege's for membership lists of al-
leged subversive student organi-
zations. She stated, “The best
course is not to cooperate.” Re-
cently, the American Civil Lib-
erties Union (ACLU) ‘sent a let-
ter to over 900 schools urging
them not to submit such mem-
bership lists. ’

Mrs. Allen cited the example
of the University of Michigan,
where HUAC demanded the mem-
bership lists of the local campus
chapters of Students for a Demo-
cratic Society, W. E. B. DuBois
Club, and the Committee to Aid
the Viet Cong. Since the univer-
sity had no such lists, Mrs. Allen
charges, the administration com-
piled, a list‘ on its own, without

Wary of Honors Code ‘

they favored the establishment of an honor code. The re-

of the undergraduates registered in the School of Liberal-

might work, but would need tremendous “advance sale” or, “the abol-. -
ishment of the incentive to cheat before establishing a code. Several .
were of the opinion that the cheating at the University couldn’t get.
much worse, and were willing to accept any system alleviating the‘,
problem. The question also arose as to the exact meaning of the word 

only bring more cheating, or that the pressure of society forces a stu-‘ .1}
dent to cheat, or that human nature in general doesn’t lend itself to an 
honors system. Another student stated, “I cheat like anything. Catch‘ '

The Liberal Arts Cabinet concurs with those ‘opposed to the  A

of the “code” stated that it would’

system on personal integrity and 
in an institution such as this" _'
(University) its implications ‘T
would largely be ignored,’-’  ,
cording to the report. The report .,
also stated that cheating at the
University is more prevelant than .
is recognized, especially in large
introductory lecture courses and
the basic natural science courses.
When asked why an honors .
code functions successfully . in, ,
many large universities across
the country, Sacks responded,
“Tradition is the key, the por--
trait of the true Ivy League gen-T1
tleman. There is no real intel1ec- ,.
tual tradition among the student Ci
body at the University, no sense A
of togetherness.” . A
Proposed solutions by the Cab- '
inet include the establishment o "
a joint student-faculty commit-,,
tee in order to study the “prob-
lem more completely. Such ,a A
committee is now functioning in ‘
the School of Engineering. f
L They also suggested that def-'7
inite regulations be set up by_
the office of the Dean of "the"
School of Liberal Arts. These‘
regulations considering the ex-. f
tent of the cheating, should be ;
stiff in nature, and should be ciref‘
culated to the faculty and to en-it
tering freshmen during their ori- -
entation period. Each case of
cheating should be reported di-
rectly tothie Dean’s office, and if ,
the same student is caught cheat-~ j
ing more than once, he could be S’
requested to leave the University-f
for at least one term. A ,
To enfore the reporting of,
cheating, more money should be.»
provided for proctors. The re- ~_j
port also stated that there should ,
be at least one proctor for every, 
50 students, and that the pres-

ence of more proctors might curb ..
the cheating to an extent. , "

Finally, the report noted, any
student accused U" of cheating

Mr. Carver:

reason I am writing this letter to

Pi  buthe ju_st‘d_o.esn’t-

 A recent report by the Liberal Arts Cabinet stated that cheating
had become such a problem on campus that it was hopeless to attempt to
institute an honor system. While the poll sponsored by the Cabinet indi-
cated that a majority of the students wanted some form of an honor sys-
tem, the groups still felt that theacademic integrity of student body was
not sufficient to support such a program.

 Their recommendations to the Dean were thata system be worked
out whereby there would be definite standards for dealing with cases of
cheating and that more proctors be hired to watch over large classrooms.

Honor systems, by and large, have been successful at schoo1s.wit.l'1
flong-standing records of academic achievement. Princeton University is
an example of an institution where such a method of operation has been
‘extremely successful. As each student enters the University, he 1s re-
quired to sign a pledge that binds him to this system.

A, Many would argue that the honor system has worked so well at Prince-
ton because it is a school of ingrained tradition. The ability to employ
such a system does not depend merely on the fact that the men at Prince-
ton accept this as an inheritance from past years. It is because they have
_a pride in the quality of education that they are receiving and it is because

they feel cheating is inevitably detrimental to their education.

If an honor system cannot work at our University, it is because we
do not have any pride in the process of learning. A person who is willing
to cheat in order to receive a grade is obviously the type of person who
has no interest in the subject matter and is simply trying to receive aca-

demic credit_ Great professors can be brought to this University, but the

educational system will not improve if the academic integrity of the stu-
dent body is so minimal.~
V The pronouncements of the Liberal Arts Cabinet could be amongst
the most important made during the past.year. They have said, in effect,
that cheating is so rampant, that no system of self-discipline could be
effective. The statements infer that for all too many University students
grades and credit come before interest in learning and protection of the
dignity of the classroom. ‘

A student body that remains silent in the face of such allegations

obviously has little honor. If there is no response, no outcry of denial to
these announcements than the Liberal Arts Cabinet must be correct in
their assumptions about the undergraduategstudent body. And this in the
end would be the gravest crisis facing the University and one which needs
immediate rectiﬁcation.

guys stay forever.” A

I hope that this isn’t true. I
have been at most of the games
this year and last and have
watched Mr. Timmons. In all sin-
cerity, the coach looks rather
pathetic. He seems to be a beat-
en man before the game starts. I
was at one game and watched
him sit on the bench ' while a
team rolled up a 25-point,half-
time lead. He could only muster
enough enthusiasm to say to the
referee that one of the fouls he
had called didn’t really happen.
I think he should have been may-
be complaining about other things
or going into the dressing room
to see what could be done. Also
at the same game, a former Pitt
player said, “He told us once that
his job didn’t depend on win-
ning.” .I think this should change!
I know that he has been our
coach for over a decade and has
been average to loss than aver-
age in record. I know _that he is
still ‘living in the glory of some
good years under leadership of
some good ball players.

The question is though, what
about today? lVIr. Timmons is, and
I think'you know, a less than
average recruiter. Most of the
men he has recruited in the past
have tried hard and deserve a
lot of credit for it, but most of
them are really not college bas-
ketball material. " From what I

have seen, it was only when the '

freshman basketball coach went
out to recruit did we get real

talent. Mr. Timmons may know_

his basketball, but I am sure you
know that coaching today takes
more than just that knowledge.
It takes an ability to enthuse
players (get them up for the big

’ games), to be dynamic when his

team is on the court, and like
Dave Hart, be a top recruiter. V

Mr. Timmons, I am sorry to
say does not posses all of these
traits; I really feel very little of
these traits. Our problem is we
need a whole coach. It should
not be the freshman coach who
recruits, but the man who will
coach them. Do you see Dave
Hart leaving his recruiting strict-
ly- to his assistants? I know that
you know he doesn't.

I, and I do not think unreal-
new coach for next season. There
are plenty of ﬁne young assis-
tants in the country. If this is not
feasible, what about Coach Grgu-
rich? You may say that he is too

young to be a head coach. I think

second year as head coach. His
record as of the other day was
12-6, and this school, which has
-build up a ﬁne tradition in this
sport, is quite satisﬁed with him.
Young Coach? Grgurich has a
a knowledge of the sport, like
Mr. Timmons, but the difference
is that he isdynamic. He could
be just what both the Pitt stu-
dents and the community fans
want.

As for Mr. Timmons, I don’t
think he has to worry,- for like
the former football coach, he has
tenure. He will have a-job next
year as basketball coach or not.
He has served Pitt well for many
years, but I think those days to
be numbered.

In conclusion, I hope that the

V saying, “They don’t care on the
,hill,”_isn’t really true. If it is -

true, I would imagine that the
trouble lies not with an old worn
out coach, but with the man who
directs the athletic program at

b the university. I certainly hope

my recommendations are heed-
ed, for there are students at
school who do care. I hope that
some other brave souls will let
themselves be known in the fu-
ture. \

Thanks you for your attention.

Editor, Pitt News: ' -

When there was an attempt to

ited seating capacity and the fact
that it was only shown twice. I
propose that the Student Union
charge a small admission fee,
say a quarter, so that they could
afford better movies and could
show them on both Friday and
Saturday evenings.

At many universities the stu-
dents can buy tickets for a speci-
ﬁc showing in advance and are
allowed to sit through the ﬁlm
more than once. This is carefully
organized so that there are no
students sitting in the aisles or
cramming through the exits. The

Editor, Pitt News:

Maybe the Minutemen don’t
have such a bad idea about keep-
ing a few shotguns handy be-
cause this country still isn’t safe
from lynchings. A few weeks ago
Adam Clayton Powell was strung
up high by the “holier than
thou” thieves for being an honest
thief. He simply did not try to
fool his constituents by maintain-_
ing _the _“honest John Smith"
image. C ‘ V.

Harlem knew how he was en-
joying himself like the other rep-
resentatives, whose constituencies
remained conveniently in the
dark. Harlem knew whoeverlwas
elected would have access‘ to a.
little juice on the side, but Har-
lem wasn’t going to risk taking
a little insigniﬁcant tarnish off
the image if it was going to mean
losing the seniority of Powell and

his power as a committee chair- ‘

man to tack the Powell amend-
ment on much legislation that
gave Negroes (recourse to due
process of law) because of dis-
criminatory practices that de-
prived them of their right to
equal opportunity. _
The Democratic ‘Party met in
caucus and stripped Powell of his
committee chairmanship which
disabled him from embarrasing
the rest of his colleagues by do-
ing in public what was accus-
tomed to being done in private.
All well and good for a party
should be permitted to clean its

dirty wash in private. The Dems ‘

even took the trouble to check
on some of Powell's horseplay,
but the opposition decided to vote
kangaroo court style with those
lovable rascals, the Solons that
represent public opinion south of

the Mason-Dixon line, and they
rode Powell out of the House on
a rail without so much as a hear-
ing to determine if what they
had been hearing was true, let
alone how .widespread it was-.
You have to give those rugged

' individuals credit however for of-

fering to investigate Powell after
they had expelled the duly elect-
ed representative of Harlem,
whose constituents still pay taxes
to run the government. Some of
the more patriotic backwoods Re-
publicans who decided to enforce
party discipline on the maverick
Republican liberals might re.-
member "one of the slogans they
must have dribb-led to ‘get elect-
ed like “Taxation without repre-
sentation is tyramiy.” If one digs
into what happened, one ﬁnds a
major revolution arose and suc-
ceeded, namely our revolution
and country that rebelled against
that horribly tyrannical country
England. .
Actually if Harlem Wants to
elect a common criminal to Con-
gress, they should have the right,

or a homosexual, or even certain 1 '

rugged someones who succeed
in secretly ﬁlching funds for
jaunts around the world-. But no
congressional district should have
the right to dictate representa-
tion to another district. There’s
nothing wrong in enforcing hon-
est administration of tax money,
but only outlaw packs hang their
members who give the game
away without so much as a hear-

ing or chance to reply in de-

fense. Congress had neither the
right to expel the Harlem repre-
sentative, nor the right to at-
tempt such a debacle without a
hearing. Could their haste and

.,lack of ﬁnesse suggest that the

other representatives are hiding
something?

tee of maintaining a “clOse lia-
son with right wing groups.” She
pointed out that the committee
publishes pamphlets, the indices
of which contain a number of
names, and through guilt by as-
sociation, anyone whose name ap-
pears in an index “must be sub-
versive.”

Mrs. Allen stated that the com-
mittee “feeds names to the Min-
utemen” and other right wing
groups, by means of the publish-
ed transcripts of its hearings.

She maintained that the days
of the committee are numbered,
that- many--congressmen are
“grumbling behind the scenes”
against HUAC, although direct
complaints have been few, ac-
cording to Mrs. Allen, because‘
the committee “has dossiers on
all congressmen.”

Also, the Supreme Court has
never decided the constitutional-
ity of the committee, and Mrs.
Allen stated that “it is a matter
of time” before the Court wﬂl
declare the committee unconsti-
tutional.

Russian Jews Persecuted A

by DIANNE FABER
Crusades for the guaran-
tee of human rights for the
past decade have centered
around the American Ne-
gros’ campaign for his civil

of cultural deprivation have been
overshadowed by the Civil Rights‘
movement in the United States.

Lacking public notice, yet still
an active force, is the struggle
to obtain equal rights for the
Jews of Russia. According to Dr.
Allan Pollack, University instruc-
tor in history, petitions have cir-
culated among various faculties
in the past in attempts to put
pressure on the Soviet Union to
extend equal nationality rights
to their Jewish population. Now,
students are interested and are
forming an organization at the
University. _

All nationality (and religious
groups in Russia, except the Jew-
ish, are permitted to have their
own schools, theaters, newspa-

"pers, Bibles, and similar cultural
facilities. As a result of pressure
from Europe and America in the

rights. Other critical areas-

past few years, the Soviet Union
has extended the privilege of a
few, a very few, of these facil-
ities to the Russian Jews.‘

It is the aim of the newly or-
ganized student group to arouse
student opinion. Communication
between University student or-
ganizations and equivalent groups
on a Russian campus will be the
means of obtaining pertinent in-
fcrmation about the current sit-
uation of the Soviet Jews.

ous groups, publications and all ‘

etting Cage Games Touches [the Absurd

Carver the following day. What resulted was the proliferation of police-
men at the following game and the appearance of an expose’ by O’Brien
in’his Pittsburgh Weekly Sports. ’ \

The Field House that night was literally a den of thieves. Present
were many of Pittsburgh’s two-bit bookies. ‘As quoted in O’Brien’s story:
“Let’s face it,” saidione of the boys who bets on the basketball games, “if
you didn’t have something riding on the “outcome of these games, you’d

‘You take the gamblers out of the field house,’ said another,

‘and you‘ might not have half the crowd you do now.’

Besides the Young punks giving the ‘charge’ sign-s, there were other
"tip-offs. On the otherside of the court, guys were moving up close to the
edge of the floor, hollering for’Pitt to “freeze’ the ball, and showing utter
despair when Pete Smith of Pitt sunk a_ basket to make the score-74-60.”

O'Brien also noted that after the game manyof the gamblers crowd-
ed around the Virginia Tech bench to congratulate Glenn Combs, w-‘ho sank
the clinching shot. 0 -_ 0

O’Brien quotes, Red -Manning nof-Duquesne, as saying, “I can’t believe
how close the gamblers get to the players, The—y’re almost sitting on the
bench.” Somebody better do something about it or there’s going. to be

. trouble up there.”

Carver‘ and O’Brien are concerned about the small-time bookies who
sit behind the visitors’ bench. Carver should also pay attention to What’s
happening in the student section. ’

No'body’s trying to beimoralistic and condemn betting. There will
always be those who get their thrills in such a manner. What’s disturbing
is seeing a group of Pitt students ‘making-fools of themselves by cheering
for the other team. Inone instance one such student nearly lost some
teeth when a freshman cager grabbed him.

For those with small cash on the game, either watch the agony in
silence -or just don’t,come. Nobody would miss you. ’

Defenseless Trackmen Face
Army’sBlackKnig htlnvasion

This Saturday

the track team will have as tough a

fight against the United States Army as the Germans did
-at Normandy Beach. The Black Knights from West Point
invade the Field House at 1:00 pm, and it looks as if only
heavy artillery and superior ‘numbers could stop them. Un-

fortunately, the track team has
neither. . H

The only thing coach Jim Ban-
ner can offer for defense is the
improvement and accomplish-
ments of a few‘ individuals and
“hope for the future.

He can take solace in his rec-
ord breakers. Although theteam
has lost by scores of 58-42 and
74-26, ﬁve varsity and Field House
records have been broken and at
least two more are likely to fall
by the end_ of the indoor season.

Greg Ellis topped the old shot

‘three-tenths of a second off the

In addition, Christie is now

before he ran in the two-mile

Army's all-around distance star
anchored that relay team and
will be here again on Saturday.

The only change Banner plans,

to make will move Handelman
from the mile to the- 1,000-yard

run. Ken Lawton will replace
him in the mile. Handelman has
been working on speed this week
and he's counting on a ﬁnal
burst at the end of the race to
put him ahead of the Cadets. “I
hope to run an intelligent race.
1'11» stay with the leaders then
kick in at theend.” The senior
star is conﬁdent this new strate- -9
gy will give him a victory.

Another hope for Banner is the
future. For" in the meets against
Kent and Penn State in individ-
ual running events, sophomores
and juniors have outscored the
seniors, 37-6.,And of the record
breakers, only Handelman will
be lost through graduation.

Battered Hoopsters Entertain

Improved F ordham Saturday

by JAY ROSENSTEIN
Assistant Sports Editor

Fordham’s surprisingly
good basketball team con-
fronts the Panther quintet
tomorrow night at the Field
House. Tipoff is at 8:15 p.m.

The Rams have compiled a 10-7
record, beating some strong clubs
in the process. With a sophomore-
dominated ball club,.coach John
Bach has fashioned victories over
Temple, 65-58; North Carolina St.,
65-63; and Georgetown, 85-82.

Ironically enough, Fordham’s

wins over N. C. St. and George-

town were on the road. Usually
the Rams are considered tough
to beat in their home gym and
much easier to topple once away
from the Bronx campus.

They’ve done this well on the
strength of only three returning
lettermen and a group of hust-
ling sophomores. .

On the other hand, the Pan-
thers exhibit a 4-13 mark after
losing to Cornell Wednesday
night, 110-72.

In comparing scores with two
common opponents, Fordham gets
the edge. The cagers lost to N. C.
St., 30-52, in Raleigh and while
both teams lost to Rutgers, Ford-
ham was beaten on Rutgers’ home
court by a closer margin.

Cornell proved toibe too much

for the Panthers to stop. Before .

the game, coach Bob Timmons
said that his cagers would have
to hold downthe Big Re-d"s Hank

South and Walt Esdaile if they "

were to have a chance.

They did part of the job. Es-
daile managed only seven points
but South scored 23, 19 in the
ﬁrst half as Cornell ran away to
a 58-31 lead at intermission.
Gregg Norris also had 23 points
for the Big Red, 14 of them
coming in the ﬁrst half. _

The Panthers never led dur-
ing the contest. Cornell shook
oﬁ a 10 day layoﬁ to shoot a
red-hot 61 per cent during that
first half spree.

Pete Smith was high man for

the cagers with 2.0 points. Len
Kalata emerged from a scoring
slump to have 16 and Al DiFri-
shia contributed 10. But they

were simply outclassed.

Fordham, although a winning
team, is a more suitable oppon-
ent. Bill Langheld, a 6-4 forward,
sparks the Rams’ attack. Their
biggest player is 6-7 Dennis Wit-

Vkowski whom .Johnny Bach ex-

pects to dominate the boards.
Witkowski is one of his ﬁne
sophomore crop.

    
  
 

 

row at 2:00 p.m.

The two men come at opposite ends of Michigan’s w1'est-

ling card, but both will be equal-
l_v rough on their varsity oppon-
ents.

The ﬁrst is Wolverine captain
Bobby Fehrs, who’ll facegRich
Shildt in the 123-pound match.
Fehrs is a two-time Big Ten
champion and runner-up in the
NCAA tournament both times.
Fehrs is undefeated this season,
although he was held to a draw
against Iowa.

is Michigan’s heavyweight, Dave

Hope to Rebound after Loss

Cubs Battle Point Park

by NIIKE BROURMAN
“We just have to recover from what happened Sunday,
and go back to playing our game,” said frosh basketball

coach Tim Grgurich, contemplating tomorrow night’s meet-

ing with Point Park at the Field House at 6:15 p.m.
Last Sunday was the day when the highly touted Cubs

were handed their ﬁrst real wal-
loping, bowing to the Duquesne
frosh, 93-59. ’

If there are some who feel that
the frosh may fall apart after a
defeat like that, Grgurich isn’t
one of them. “This team won't
collapse. I really respect them.
They come from high schools
with a ﬁne tradition. I’ve never
played with a loser and neither
have they, and they are too proud
to start now.”

Grgurich credits the team’s loss
to Duquesne to the Dukes’ press
and to the Cub’s own tiredness.
“It was the ﬁrst time that we
ran into a defense like that. We’re
using former forwards at guard,
and although we’ve practiced
against that defense, they couldn’t
cope with it.” he said.

“The boys are real tired. Be-
sides the 11 games we’ve played,
there are ﬁve or six that no-
body knows about. We’ve scrim-
maged against guys like Connie
Hawkins, people much better
than us, and the boys are learn-
ing, but, naturally they're tired
too. We were- due for a game
like that.’V’

As a remedy, the coach has
let up somewhat on his team.
“We’ve cut down our practices.

centrate more on team play and
on sh_ooting.”

The Cub’s shooting has been
off as of late, as witnessed by
the 2;) per cent average against
Duquesne. “We’re getting more
shots and making less,” explains
Grgurich, “I think they are forc-
ing their shots a little. Everyone
is trying to carry the team on
his own." ‘

Point Park should be a rugged
test for the frosh. The Parkers

boast an 8-3 record and a four

game win scan.

*All-American tackle -from West-

inghouse High.

From 80 to 100 schools sought
the graces of Weston, who was
named to both Parade High
School’s and Coach and Athlete’s
All-American ﬁrst teams. He was
All-State on both press wire serv-
ices, and he was selected to the
Pennsylvania Big 33 team.

“Lloyd is an outstanding prod-
uct,” Hart said. “He typliﬁes the
kind of boy we Want at Pitt.
We’re proud to have him.”

With__Weston, 1_4 scholastic
players have signed grants-in-aid

~ and Harts feels there isn’t a nine-

dollar bill among them.

The ﬁrst player signed was Al-
toona’s Dave McGrath, an All-
State end. Following him were

quarterback Dave Havern, who
scored 26 touchdowns running
and passing for Montour_High;
Avalon’s 6-3, 225 pound tackle
Bruce Harkiewicz; Joe Spicko,
for the 52-yard ﬁeld goal he
kicked for Reynolds High; and
Jerry Leary, a 6-2, 205 pound
tackle from Beaver Area.
Others recently signed are full-
back Bill Ramos of Johnstown;
Stowe’s highly touted Tony Es-

posito; and Larry Watkins, an
‘ All-Stater. from Canton, Ohio.

Linebackers John Wozniak, Bald-
win’s Big 33er; Ed Sinesky of
Bethel Park; and Beaver Falls’
Ken Shumaker also signed.

Other recruits were tackles Bill

Gymnastic Squad Travels

To West Point Tomorrow

Based on past performances, a
powerful Army team should pro-
pel the gymnasts to their seventh
defeat of the season to-morro-W at
West Point. Army carries a 4-2
record into the meeting having
lost to, Penn State and Spring-

. ﬁeld, the top two teams in the

East.

Coach Neiger again plans’ to
use Dave‘ Shidemantle in four
events, with Jim Sacco and Ig
Perez going in all six. Neiger
hopes Perez can repeat last week’s

performance in the floor exercise
and Sacco can come through as
he did aginst Kent State.
Army, a much stronger team,
18 members with a speciaist in
in each event. The cadets have
