New dean °eternal optimist’

Success could spoil Moye’s job

by SUE HOENSTINE

To receive a permanent ap-
pointment as an undergraduate
dean is heartening. But to as-
sume the post, knowing that suc-

cess could lead to the abolition

of your office takes a few
extra ounces of confidence  .
or naivete.

Describing himself as “the

eternal optimist” and "so cock-
eyed that it’s unbelievable,” Dr.
Alfred Moye, newly appointed

, Dean of Student Affairs, appears

at ' least enthusiastic enough to
take on the nebulous task.

“I don’t feel threatened-by the
possible disappearance of my
office. If I don’t work hard at
this we’ll never find out if the
office is necessary,” the Chem-
istry professor declared.

He explained that this winter
he will take-a leave of absence
from his teaching duties in or-
ganic chemistry to get his “feet
wet in the area of Student Af-
fairs.” _

Then he plans to teach one
course a term along with hand-
ling his administrative tasks.

During an administrative shuf-
fle last July, the Chancellor ap-
pointed a task force to investi-
gate, among other things, the
necessity of a Student Affairs
coordinator. Moye is anxious to
help the task force in its work.

And the new dean has no
qualms about the possibility of
proving his office redundant. “I
love teaching and I like it here,”

the chemist mused as ‘he sur-
veyed his present surroundings
in Engineering Hall.

A tall metal bookshelf sagging
with chemistry journals shadows
his desk. But the carbon atom
schemes that decorate his memos
look about as appropriate for a
would—be administrator as track
shoes on a turtle.

."If we’re going to have an
area of Student Affairs it should
be vital, vigorous and constant-
ly trying to meet the needs of
students. And I’m not quite sure
what these needs are,” Moye
added. '

“I’m not really going in with
any changes in mind," he ad-
mitted. He_ expressed his con-
fidence in the present staff of
Student Affairs that will be
responsible to him. Special’ Pro-
grams, the Placement Center,
the Health Service, the Coun-
seling Center and the Foreign
Student Office will be under
the jurisdiction of the Dean of
Student Affairs.

The affable professor also an-
ticipates working “side by side”
with the Student Association.
“But I don’t want to be the big
daddy of the group,” he stressed.

“I think it’s valuable for stu-
dents to get experience in run-

ning their own activities, but it’s '

a different story when student
leaders are~not in touch with
their constituents,” Moye said.

When questioned whether stu-
dent apathy disturbed him the

new dean -said that trends in
—student apathy or involvement
"tend to go in cycles.” He char-
acterized the present campus
mood as "a lack of interest on
the part of everyone. not just
students. If you call the stu-
dents apathetic what to you call
the faculty when only about a
fifth will show 'up for a faculty
meeting?”

that “students were a lot more

fun a, few years ago” when in-
volved in sit-ins and political
protest. ' A

by HEIDI 1). LEVIN

‘Senator George McGovern
(D-S.D.) is expected to touch
on a wide variety of national
problems—political, economic,
and social—-as well" as discuss
various international issues,
during his appearance Sunday
at‘ 8 p.m. in Carnegie Music
Hall.

McGovern is perhaps best
known for his strong opposition
‘to the Vietnam ‘War. He first
spoke out against the war in
September 1963 in a speech be-
fore the U.S. Senate. Since then,
he has continually called for
immediate and complete with-
drawal of all U.S. forces from
Vietnam. .

McGovern has also advocated
the extension of amnesty to all
draft "dodgers." He has pro-
posed that anyone charged with
war-related crimes, as well as
those responsible for U.S. in-
volvement in Southeast Asia.
also be granted amnesty.

Harris Miller. the Western
Pennsylvania coordinator of
Students and Youth for McGov-
ern. argued that such an ex-
tension of amnesty would imply
recognition of the error of U.S.
involvement in Vietnam but
would serve to end debate on
the war.

Once the war issue has been
settled, Mc Govern hopes to
see more money and effort di-
rected to what he has described
as a "new national goal; an end
to poverty _a”nd.poll_ution and ra-

  Phase I future

solidiﬁes today   

by BILL GORMLEY
Editor

The heated dispute over Phase

I of the University’s Forbes dev- I

elopment plan may become his-
tory today, as the General State
Authority decides whether to_ap-
prove Plan D, a revised Phase I
proposal. A

Plan D, which has been endors-
ed by the University, the commun-
ity, and the city, calls for the con-
struction of a Law School on the
sites of what are presently the
Civic Center Motel and the Hum-
ble Station.

Under the plan, a School of Ed-
ucation-Social Sciences complex
would be built in the Forbes Field
area parallel to Sennott St. Pedes-
trian bridges would cross over
Forbes Ave. and Sennott St., link.-
ing the buildings with the dormi-
tory areas.-

A major objection to the Uni-
versity’s original Phase I plan—
that it would necessitate the clos-
ing of Sennott St. and portions of
Bouquet ’St.—-evaporates if the
new Phase I plan is approved by
the GSA. "Both the community and
the city objected to that aspect of
the original plan.

If the GSA approves Plan D,
the University might face another
obstacle when it seeks the city’s
permission to construct the Law

School and the elevated walk-ways.

To curtail a drain on the city’s
tax base, Mayor Peter Flaherty
declared a moratorium on the ex-
panion of tax-exempt institutions
after Dec. 4, 1970. Because the

University secured the land on.

,which the Law School would be

cation, as well as voting rights,‘

laws.

The Party Reform Committee
was chaired by McGovern fol-
lowing its inception" in 1968.
Along with the later chairmen
‘of the Committee, Donald Fra-
ser (R—Minn.) and James O’Hara
(D-Mich.). McGovern has been
active in .the move to improve
the selection of delegates to the
"Democratic National Convention
in 1972.

In international affairs, Mc-
Govern‘ continues to "advocate
.U.S. support of Israel in the
Middle East. This support, Mc-
Govern feels, should take the
form. of military aid while con-
tinued attempts are made to ar-
range a peaceful solution to the
conflict. '

McGovern has also called for
further troop withdrawals from
Western Europe. He has advo-
cated placing more responsibility
for defense of this area with our
European allies. .According to
McGovern. the resulting cuts in
U.S. military expenditures would
do much to solve the country’s
balance of payments problems.

According to Robert Paternos- ‘

Mayor Flaherty will permit a tax-
exempt institution like the Uni-
versity to expand if arrangements

are made to compensate the city "

for the taxes that would be lost.

At a meeting with the Mayor
Monday, Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar told Flaherty that the Uni-
versity could not legally comply
with Flaherty’s request because

“The use of state funds would

News yesterday. He explained‘
that the University cannot dis-. ,

comes from the state and that
which comes from other sources.

Expressing sympathy for the,

city’s dilemma, Posvar said the . 5

problem of a small tax base is '-

“especially acute in Pittsburgh.”
However, he said, “We can't help
solve the propblem by turning
ourselves into an illegitimate ma-
jor conduit from the state treas-
ury.

McFadden, Kobosky*s Execu-

University administration has
had “informal communications
with the Law School.” 
McFadden conceded. how-

ever, that “maybe some input
should have~been made” with
Dean Sell on Friday. following
a Thursday night consensus be-
tween the University and »Peo-
ple’s Oakland on a new plan to
construct the Law School on the
site of the Civic Center Motel.
Previous plans called for build-
ing the Law School in the
Forbes Field area.

Dissatisfied with McFadden’s
response, a student accused the
University administration of a
“lack of‘ good faith with the Law
School” and said, Law School
students and administrators have
not received sufficient informa-
tion on “what the heck's going
on with the (new) Law School.“

Distinguishing -between the
design of a new Law School and
the determination of its exact
location, McFadden said the
University administration secur-
ed “a lot of input—on the design

School representatives.

Friday, McFadden asked, “What
could we say to the Dean at
this point?" _

McFadden added that the de-
cision of where to locate the
Law School “will be made out-
side the University"-by the Gen-
eral State Authority (GSA).
which met this morning to con-
sider the question.

'Kobosky, who arrived later

after a meeting with Mayor Fla-
herty, said the University has
“every indication” the new Phase
I plan will be endorsed by the
GSA.

"If the GSA turns the plan
down. what happens?" a student
asked.

"Then. we‘ll go back to the
drawing boards.“ McFadden
responded.

Both. Kobosky and McFadden
admitted that the Law Schools
space problems are particularly
acute. While stressing that other
Schools (the School of Education.
for example) are plagued by a
shortage of space. McFadden
conceded that the “crowding“
in the Law School is "one of the

15hiaseI'info gap’  

more severe" at the University.

According to Kobosky, Mayor
Peter Flaherty is especially anx-
ious for the speedy construction
of a new Law School. In discus-
sing the need for new facilities
at the University, Kobosky said,
“Flaherty cited the Law School
in particular.”

Kobosky A also affirmed that
Chancellor ' Wesley Posvar told
a group of Law School repre-
sentatives that the Law School
“would receive the top priority
of any professional school at the
University."

McGovern- supporters hope rally
will correct mcrlia °mistrcatmcnt’

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

Supporters of Senator George
McGovern’s presidential nomina-
tion have scheduled a rally for
Sunday which they hope,_ will
“correct” the image of McGov-
ern which the press has created.

In the view of Harris Miller;

a Pitt student working in behalf ,

of Senator McGovern‘s cam-
paigrix for the presidency. the
media have, until recently. writ-

ten McGovern off as a probable‘

loser. ‘ -

“He has been extremely mis-
treated in the public news,me-
dia,” Miller said.’ “They put him

on page 73 and say that McGov-.

ern can’t win. First, the.media
downplay his importance, then,
after polls". they come back and
overplay his role. I would be
much happier if they just play-
ed up his true role in the past
few months.”

Miller, ' an organizer ' of the

McGovern movement on cam-.

pus, outlined the goals ‘of the
rally.

’‘‘One of the two specific ob-
jectives is that those people who
are definitely committed to Sen-

"The second objective,” he
continued, “is for those people

willing to support Senator Mc-
Govern, but are very interested
in listening to his beliefs, in
seeing how he performs in front

of an audience and how he re-

lates to people.

In conjunction with this sec-

ond objective, Mi1ler- explained

This will be

the existence of‘_a "rally cornmit— ‘

tee” composed of persons not
necessarily committed .to Mc-

Govern but convinced that all

major

candidates should be
heard. P

. .Miller spoke of "the new dele-

_year

gate selection procedure-epassed
by the'Democratic State Com-
mittee as giving candidates like
McGovern a better chance at
getting elected. He cited this
as “a task to which we all must
turn after the November 14
rally.” -

Miller explained that this
oven 75 percent of the
state delegates will be elected,
a substantial number in" compari-
son to other years. Therefore,
Miller feels that working _for a
candidate such as McGovern

will not be the same as “turning '

out meaningless votes for Mc-
Govern, but giving a very real
chance ofturning out delegates,
which is the name of the game
at this point.”

Miller also said that McGov-

ern sees college students as "not
having preconceived committ-
ments to a party” and as hav-
ing “divergent views from their
parents.”

According to Miller, approxi-.

mately 200 college body presi-
dents have endorsed McGovern
and several college polls have
shown him to be the leading con-
tender on the Democratic ticket.

Although the rally is the high-
light of the McGovern effort in

by MARY WELTY

The Commuter Association an-
nounced at a recent meeting that
375 parking spaces will be made
available to students on comple-
tion of the Panther Hollow - Jon-

, caire parking area. .

They also revealed that the
Trees Hall parking ‘lot might be

Lud Hanczar, Parking Com-

completion was promised for

Other business included a dis-

sections that need be changed, it
was decided, are those on mem-
bership and elections.

Associate Editor

The Faculty of Arts and ,Sci-
ences recently created several de-
gree options that will, according
to Dr. Jerome Schneewind,’ “give
students greater responsibility
for determining the shape of
their education.” -

One of these innovations is the
Bachelor of Arts degree in Lib-
eral Studies. Designed for stu-
dents hoping to explore many
fields, a Liberal Studies degree

does not require students to de-

clare a traditional major.

Instead, students in Liberal Stu-
dies must earn 120 credits with an
overall average of 2.00 or better,
must satisfy the Distribution of

any changes in the constitution
and hopes to have further dis-
cussion on it at their next gener-
al meeting.

. Al Watterson, Bus Committee
chairman, reported that the Oc-
tober PAT ‘Day hadlnot accom-
plished much more than better
understanding between commut-
ers and PAT (Port Authority
Transit). Therefore, he suggested

another PAT Day be organized A

for the second term to work on
specific problems.

He also suggested that a ques-

tionnaire be put in the Magic

Bus the CA newspaper, to de-
termine how many commuters
ride the buses. - ‘

He said he would soon “find
out about the possibility of PAT
reinstituting monthly passes.”
He stated also that he would ask
"PAT to bring out a larger num-
ber of schedules and make them

available to everyone,” rather
than to just the regular riders of
a particular route.

Hanczar asked for a publicity

letter to inform commuters about

numbered in the 180’s or 1-90’s.

would view the Liberal Studies
option as an “easy” path to a de-

“we’re not making it any softer.

two or more departments may col-

of studies.

A joint major must include at
least 36 and not more than 60

satisfy the requirements of a joint
major need not have “minor”
areas of study.

The Departments of Philosophy

Around 1885, construction be-

at Wood’s Run on Pittsburgh’s
lower North Side. Built at a cost
of over two million dollars, what
was once the most "expensive and
pretentious prison in America,”
says the Pennsylvania Magazine

superintendent, an impediment to
prisoner rehabilitation.

The cells are small—7’x8’—and

When the first Western Peni-
tentiary was built in the 1820’s,
the method of the State prison
system was solitary confinement.
Men were to be kept out of contact
with other individuals. including
family; in isolation they could
“repent and reform,” at least ac-
cording to the law. V

In later years, as more pro-
gressive penal theories devel-
oped, the impetuswas shifted, at
least verbally, from penanceand
retribution to rehabilitation. I

A recurrent theme in jokes
from the West Virginia boon-
docks concerns the city slicker
who gets taken by a local‘bump-
kin. An example of» such a joke
might include a traveling sales-
man who, on the_morning after,

gets charged a fin by the farmer’s

daughter.

Something similar to this hap-
pened recently at Pitt and I, think
the story and its implications are
worth relating.

A few Saturdays ago. the Fac-
ulty of Arts and Sciences (FAS)
met in full session to consider a
number of proposals, one of which
was a resolution urging for a cen-

tion. The publicized stress in this
area in recent years is reflected
in the changing terminology:
"prison” has become “correc-
tional institutionff a "prisoner"’
is a"‘resident,” “shop labor" is
known as “correctional indus-
tries.“ and "guards” are "correc-
tional officers.”

Rehabilitation is attempted
through a series of programs de-
termined by the inmates counse-

_ lor and the staff of the institution.

plains, will help develop in 

“stability, responsibility, and
good work habits.”
This may be anything from

clerical work in one of the pris-
on‘s offices to laborin the tag
shop punching out state license
plates. The inmate is also encour-
aged to enlist in voluntary pro-
grams such as education (grade
school, high school, vocational
and college level). group work
(therapy). Alcoholics Anony-
mous. or the Drug Clinic.

Frequently during his incar-
ceration, the prisoner will be ask-
ed “what are you doing to better
yourself?”

The “points” he gets for parti-
cipating in a program along with
his conduct record weigh heavily
in his future. A man with a good
record and high points will prob-
ably make parole soon after his
minimumis served; a man with
no points and misconducts may
not. '

P Yet all these changes aside. the
first responsibility of the prison
as seen by much of the Legisla-
ture, the public, and a number of
prison officials, remains deter-
rence. Security—by far the larg-
est single expenditure in the insti-
tution’s budget——guards, guns,
walls, consumes about 90 cents of
each dollar.

And while .the institution may
have one counselor for 180 in-
mates, there remains a guard at
each corner and gate in the yard.

“I’ve literally got a man’s life, .

his future in my hands,” one
frustrated counselor said. “Seven
of us for 750 men. I’d like to put
those guards to work but they’re
just not trained to rehabilitate
men.”

As one high-ranking correction-
al officer said, "For the public
and the courts, our first job is
protecting life and property. They
don’t want a man let loose who
might commit the same crime
again—so se have to keep him
here until they’re sure he’s all
right. And that might take a long
time.“

      
   

' tolhappen again. So it behooves

every student to understand the
strategies necessary for starting
one’s own department.

The first thing one must do to
get a department of, shall we say,
‘X, is to find a group of flak-catch-
ing FAS members. This group
should include at least one Dean.

Your goal is to make them feel
guilty for being unconscious Xists
and to show how the cause of X is
consistent with their liberal bias.

In the first case, you could
show them how they treat X's as
objects rather than things, val-
uable in themselves. Flak-catch-
ers are by nature a bundle of un-

directed guilt and you will find
that it is not difficult to focus
tremendous guilt on your casue.

To show how the cause of X fits
into their general liberal bias,
simply compare X favorably with
some of their other flak-catching

forays. Trees, Black Panthers,

women, Portnoy, and the People
are suitable topics for compari-
son. _

Similarly, one should show that
LBJ, Nixon, the FBI and George
Wallace are against X. If your
flak-catchers are of the romantic
variety, you might also mention
that Kennedy like X. (It doesn’t
matter which Kennedy so long as

' it isn’t Joe!)

Finally, make it clear that the
only way they can purge them-
selves of Xist guilt is to help you
start a department of X. '

Second, to keep in the current
academic fad of interdepartmen-
talism, you .must show that to
study X, one will have to draw
from a variety of areas. You can

do this simply by listing courses
such as the Economics of X. the
History of X, X in Society, X Lit-
erature, X Art, etc.

Corollary to this is the idea
that because your Department of
X includes other disciplines, it
will enrich each separate disci-
pline through cross-fertilization.

If this isn’t immediately clear,
try thinking of yourdepartment
as a little bee, flying from stam-
en to pistil. stamen to pistil. Try
to ignore the fact that the little
bee that does this job is a drone.

This, if there has /been little
done throughout history , on the
subject of X, do not despair. This
only helps to show the extent of
Xism; i.e. Xism is such a perni-
cious purveyor of poppycock that
almost everyone has almost al-
ways considered X unimportant.

One of your goals, therefore, is '

to develop literature in the field
of X. If extant literature takes a
jaundiced position on the subject
of X and attempts to show that X
is abnormal and unacceptable,
your goal is to show that not only

is X normal but worthly of emu-

lation.

Fourth, if you are asked about
your pedagogical methods, sim-
ply say that you intend to use new .
teaching procedures which will
help students to feel and intuit
the relationships between them-
selves and X, or if X is a group,
to develop an identity consistent
with their natural, historical, and
biological predispositions.

Sensitivity groups, known to
cynics as emotional fascism, is
one suchteaching method cur-
rently holding high status in both
flak-catching and student camps.

Finally, be humorless.

Editor:

I am writing re your editorial
(“Cycle of Suspicion Dents Black

, Studies Bridge, Nov. 3, Pitt.News).

The article was inaccurate in a
number of areas and incomplete
in some of its explanations which
led to some misleading implica-
tions which I am sure the writer
did not intend.

The Black Studies Department
and the CAS Advising Center do
not have only a “whispered dial-
ogue,” but an open forum in which
common problems are discussed.
Registration information and des-

criptions of all Black Studies,

Courses are available in the Ad-
vising Center and CAS advisers
keep this information on file. in
addition to other departmental in-
formation.

Black Studies offerings are in-
cluded in Freshman Orientation,

group sessions, orientation for

relocating students at the region-
al campuses, and in new-adviser

training sessions along with the.

rest of the academic programs at
this University.

Had the editor completed his
"homework,” he would have found
out exactly what the Advising Cen-
ter is doing. This is not to say
that we are doing enough; we can
never do enough. But to describe
our efforts as “precious little” is
to ignore the work of the CAS ad-
visers (13 of whom are black!) in
this direction as well _as the ef-
forts of the Black Studies Depart-
ment to assist us in an efficient
transmission of information.

The article, in so briefly and
generally tackling a ‘sensitive is-
sue, seems to be about the busi-
ness of stirring up racial tensions

‘instead of examining the many

changes and steps that have been
made.

The Blackstudies major was

fact that ‘Black Studies enroll-

tioned;

The publications of the Black
Studies staff were not mentioned.
In what could have been a sensi-
tive and informative article, the
editor preferred to emphasize
Black-White tensions, fear and
trembling, for which those of us
who are concerned about progress
have very little time.

If the editor wishes to complete
his homework and find out more
about Black Studies at Pitt, he is
referred to the Black Studies De-
partment or (would you believe?)
the CAS Advising Center. '

Of -course, Black Studies has an
added political dimension which
is both inescapable and ‘neces-
sary. Some courses do indeed
serve the function of raising the
consciousness level of Black stu-
dents. Many women’s studies of-
ferings have this same dimen-
sion.

In today's Career Comer, Pitt News reporter Steve
Lubetsky examines the field of law and the difficulties
"of getting accepted to law school. 

A steadily rising influx of students is prompting
.law schools throughout the country to adopt more selec-
tive admissions policies.

 - At George Washington School of Law, reports Ad-
missions Director Mrs. Leonard Gray, the number of
applicants has soared from 3500 in 1965 to 4500 this
‘year. In 1972, she expects “4800 or higher. Every year
we get more.” i

“ i To be admitted, she said, a student must have a
.3._0 grade ‘average, or a score of 600 or better on the
‘Law School Aptitude Test (LSAT).

 Professor Michael Moorehead, Chairman of the Ad-
missions Committee at Howard University School of
‘Law, said Howard’s policy is to admit “a large num-
'ber of low-risk students.”

. “We have a space problem,’ .\/Ioorehead said.
“There is a fixed number of spaces, and the applicants
compete.”

1 Dr. Richard Seeburger, Chairman of the Admis-
_sion.s Committee at Pitt's School of Law, said that the
number of applicants here has risen from 600 four
years ago to 1500 this year.

; - “We are being more selective,” he said. “We’re
admitting 160 next year.” i

based on a 3.2 grade average and a 650 LSAT score. He
emphasized, however, that “standards are misleading."

“There are many qualified applicants,” he said,
“but the closer cases are determined by space.”

Stressing the advantages of studying law, Seeburg—
er asserted that “a legal education is the best kind of
education for anything. It’s training in analytical think-
ling‘)! .

’ Moreover, he said, there are plenty of opportunities
for lawyers.

“Many,” he said, "go into business, and some are
professors. Others practice criminal law, corporate law,
‘and poverty law.”

“Law,” he said, “is socially relevant. People can do
good for society while earning a decent living.”

He also cited the steady decline of graduate pro-
grams as a factor in-the law schools’ enrollment boom.

“Outside support has dropped off," Seeburger
noted, “but legal institutions take care of themselves.’'

A spokesman for a leading law firm in Pittsburgh
mentioned some of the various fields open to law school
graduates.

“Not all possibilities involve practice,” he said.
“People enter law firms, businesses, legal corporations,
and bank trust departments.”

does not foresee a glut.of unemployed lawyers.

can do, ‘such as preparing documents. It cuts down the
time that lawyers have to spend on these things."

A Pitt senior currently filling out applications to
law schools admitted that he would attend “any school
that will take me."

“Once you have a Doctor of Juris degree,” he stat-
ed, “ ou can 0 an where. Even if ou don’t ractice,
Y Y Y P
it’s so much easier.”

Another student contemplating law school remark-
ed that “there"aren’t many good jobs for the future, and
I would like to‘ work for myself. Law is one of the few
jobs you can work for yourself and don’t have to be an
outright businessman.”

A student at the Duquesne School .of Law said of
his first year there: “I like it very much, but it’s hard."

As for the future, he’ said he is “not really sure.
I’m thinking of neighborhood legal services, and even-
tually private practice.”

“But right now, it’s hard to be that far-sighted when
you’re concerned about staying in school.”

Cross-listing abolition considered

by HEIDI LEVIN

Abolition of cross-listing of courses in the College
of Arts and Sciences.catalogue is being contemplated
by or Jerome Schneewind, Dean of the College.

Cross listing of courses,‘ according to Schneewind,
has resulted in students receiving credit for two or more
courses listed under different departments when they
have taken only one course. '

Schneewind labeled the cross-listing prodedure as
merely an “informational device" for the convenience
of students using the College catalogue.

However, he said, the practice also gives mislead-
ing information as to the number of courses a depart-
ment offers.

Schneewind explained that although a department
offers only a certain number of its own courses, the

Textbooks for the Fall Term will be ‘removed from the   Book center
shelves on November 12, 1971 to make room for the incoming Win-
ter Term Books. If a textbook was ordered and you have not started‘
to use it in class, have your Professor call The Textbook Department
and the book will be retained until the end of the term. A

In: BOOK CENTER  

College catalogue may list a considerably larger num-
ber of courses in the department due to cross-listing.

Schneewind agreed that the purpose of cross-listing
—to inform students of courses, related to their major
fields which are accepted towards their degree require-
ments—is a useful servicelfor the student body. Rather

than cross-list such courses, though, Schneewind propos- /‘

ed that each department merely list these recommend-
ed courses separate from its own courses.

Courses thus listed would use the name and num-
ber of the department under which they are taught.

Staff members from the Dean’s office are currently
compiling information on all cross-listed courses. Once ,
this information is complete, Schneewind will make a

formal proposal to the CAS Council to terminate the pro-

ceedure.

YMCA EXHIBIT:
A bizarre socialist plot?

(Continued from Page 1)

I'm pretty well removed from
these groups here. But I’m look-
ing forward to working with
black students. And I see no

problems in
with the women.” s

‘Over the summer, the Advis-
ory Council on Women’s Oppor-
tunities (ACWOl and the Black
Action Society (BAS) objected
to the rumored appointment of

Dan McFadden as Acting Vice.

Chancellor for ‘Student Affairs
on the grounds that he was not
"sensitive” to women or blacks.

McFadden was not appointed

to the position.

Asked whether he would urge

black and white students to work
closely on student activities
lVloye declared, “If people are
quite happy the way things are
happening now, I see no need
to try to push them together.”

A MILLION ITEMS,

212 ATWOOD STREET

 

by RON LOZOWSKI
Feature Editor

“Power to the people“ might have been the theme of this year's
version of the annual YMCA Bazaar. held in the Student Union ‘Ballroom
Monday and Tuesday.

“Actually. we're trying to promote socialism." quipped one of the
volunteers behind the counters. The actual explanation offered for the
statement was that the projects planners hoped to benefit cooperative
community ventures, rather than large corporations.

The purpose of the bazaar was to raise money to fund the Y3/lCA"s
community service, programs. Students browsing among the ‘various
displays could invest in hand-made items ranging from neckties to rag
dolls. *

Unlike previous years, the goods featured at the affair were arts
I and crafts created by numerous community interest groups.

“In this way, the profits go to self-help groups rather. than to big
companies.‘__‘ said the clerk. - -

Customers were also encouraged to contribute to a special fund
that may enable Western Pennsylvania prisoners to purchase Christ-_
mas giftsvfor their children. ~' ‘ t T

While the workers—all volunteers—revmarked that the crowds at-
tracted by the endeavor had been quite sizable, economically they said
the bazaar was not as successful as they had hoped it would be.

Commented another clerk: “We did pretty well—but not as well
as we could have."

initiation of new members
throughwhat the club members
refer to as "a ridiculouslycfoolish
ritual.“

Friday night marked the cele-
bration of the “foolish ritual" for
the 13 freshmen entering the
club.

Steve Nedimyer, president of
the organization. described the
initiation as "a chance to share
fellowship and good wine . . . fun,
and nobody is forced to do any-

‘ thing.“

The antics Friday night includ-
ed a mock inquisition in which
freshmen were led through three

‘ rooms and madetodothi_ngstheup-

-perclassmen told them. 1

“Much of what was done was
ridiculous little things,” said
Nedimyer, “For -example one
freshman was put in charge of

lighting a certain persons cigar--

ette. The whole weekend was an
initiation. Old members enter-
tained new. members and new
members entertained the old. It
was a way to pass the time."

under the direction of Philip S
Cavanaugh. . » —

The 33 men in.the club who.w_eiit,'=
on tour drew a crowd of 80 at St’
Bonaventure, and “enthusias
audience” of‘200 at Seton Hill. T~_h_
relatively small audience at -St.
Bonaventure was attributed to"
the ihopportune scheduling _of‘
mixer at the same time as th,
concert. ‘

The men wore tuxedos for the-f
first part of the program,‘ which _

the second half, devoted to more;
popular numbers. was staged in"
costumes. A folk group called?
“Joe’s Friends” presented tw_
numbers, and another- - numbe
was done by soloist Walt Cramer};

A three minute film by Kenny:

with the song How to Handle.-an"
Woman. Other props were usedﬂ
during songs in the second half’-
and dancing was incorporated.in~'
some of the numbers. A combo’
of musicians from the Glee .Cl'ub"7
accompanied the more‘popular-‘—~
numbers. '  .

ELVIS: The King shattered a packed house last week In Cleveland,

as he shook, rattled and rolled his way along, unleashing--a barrage
of his own hits and other artists’ material. '

Elvis returns to send us:

swivel hips lets ’er   rip

RON LOZOWSKIO
Feature Editor

A musical monarch, already
forever enshrined in the rock
pantheon, last Saturday regaled
the masses with an overwhelm-
ing display of artistic flair and
vocal dynamite. Back on tour
again, the aforementioned mon-
arch, Elvis Presley, let ‘er rip

-- for a capacity crowd at Cleve-

land Public Auditorium.

The unavoidable intermission
had followed the opening acts.
Abruptly, the house lights dim-
-med, and the band produced‘
the familiar strains of Strauss’

. Thus Spake Zarathustra, perhaps

more popularly recognized as

the overture from 2001. As the

piece faded, the King stepped
onto the stage, stood and stared
momentarily, then tore into his
classic That’s All Right.

And it was. Raunchy and re-
sonant as ever, he belted out the
old favorite, then greeted the
crowd: “Hello—I’m Johnny
Cash.” But ‘this performance
by no means walked the line
toed by lesser artists. Elvis
demonstrated the clumination of
brute
act combined and controlled
within the figure of a living
legend.

Delivering his own unique
renditions of a number of con-
temporary "standar'ds”—Polk

. Salad Annie, You’ve Lost That

Lovin’ Feelin’, and Bridge Over
Troubled Water, among others-
the King embraced all styles
with an unrivalled excellence
that led one to ponder what he
had ever seen in the originals.

Nor was his own musical
heritage forgotten; Elvis shook
up the audience with such mem-

horabilia as Hound Dog, One.
Night, Love Me Tender, and
Heartbreak Hotel. Although

he didn’t appear to be taking
the compositions as seriously as

~ he might have a. decade ago. the -

pulsating performance was a
delight to behold——Elvis Presley
has lost none of his power
through the years.

The sound and fury released

on stage are unparalelled by ,

any other artist on the current
rock scene—-even the unabated

excitement of a Who or Tina‘

beauty and valor and-.

ficulty in matching ol’ swivel
hips in action. All doubts were
settled that afternoon when Elvis
rocked and rolled through “John-
ny B. Goode.” - .

To be in Pittsburgh or not to
be in Pittsburgh—that is the ques-
tion, though. The Civic Arena
is vastly superior structure to
Cleveland Public Auditorium,
and one can’t help but muse,
“Why not?’-’ Maybe Elvis’ man-
Parker should
march up to the proper author-
ities and arrange for that mo-
mentous event. It would be well
worth the effort.

For the crowned head need
not rest uneasily. Though the
"superstar” tag is bandied about
all too loosely these days, in a
time of tinsel and mediocre
“artistry,” Elvis remains the
genuine article. And so long as
there’s an Elvis Presley, rock ‘n’
roll ainft never gonna die!

Studio Theater

Lethargic ”Lesson” Learned

by CHARLES LEVINE
Drama Staff

Eugene Ionesco concerns him-
self in many of his plays with
the absurd repretitiveness that
marks the existence of his char-
acters. They are brass balls con-
fined to a hollow bowl—destined
to move up one side or the
other. but always coming to rest
at the bottom,— only to become
recharged for the next ill-fated

_ attempt.

The characters are necessar-
ily thinly drawn caricatures
from an old discarded Laurel
and Hardy movie. The ineffec-
tuality of the players, their cas-

tration under fire, is the fuel‘

for their creative impulse. one
which predictably leads them
back to somewhere preceeding
their point of origin.

They are lovable in their hope-
less attempts to escape from the
few banal events that, like the
frames of a strip of film, pass by
again and again only to form the
image of a stagnant pool.

The Chairs and The Lesson,
two Ionesco one—acts currently
being produced by the studio
Theatre are exemplary of the

’ emotional and personal impact

such structure can carry on the
one hand, and on the other. the
intense boredom. .

The Chairs is done very well,

and the direction of Karl Harsh--

barger added to the freshness
of a play which could easily end
up with an old man and woman

.sitting fixedly for three-quar-

ters of its length.

Rich Johnston as the old man,
and Carol Gnatuk as his wife,
Semirimus, take full advantage
of the area at hand, and the
movement -itself, the “half-excit-
ed” shuffle of “half-dead” peo-
ple seemed to capture just
enough of these two qualities to
make it a statement of its own.

As the “invisible visitors” en-
ter the lives of thetwo old peo-
ple, as they become completely
submerged and engulfed _in

their own fantasy, their pathetic .

jubilation and frenzy is real.
Johnston and Gnatuk are both
outstanding, and as they enact
the childish, silly routines that
have been their lives.

The absurdity is no more

MCKenna maintains
”Here are ladies”

Siobhan McKenna, Ire1and’s actress, will present Irish poets.
playwrights and novelists in an evening of readings entitled Here
Are Ladies Saturday, November 20, at 830 p.m. in the Carnegie

' Lecture Hall in Oakland.‘

Produced by the New York Shakespeare Festival, McKenna’s
Pittsburgh appearance is sponsored by the International Poetry

Forum. '

Tickets are now on sale at Gimbels, Kaufman’s and Homes.
and Pitt, Duquesne, and Carnegie-Mellon Student Unions.

McKenna’s acting career began at Galway University where
she joined the Gaelic translations of O’Casey,_Barrie, O’Neill.

Shakespeare, and Moliere.

Subsequently,

she became involved

with the Abbey Players, an affiliation she maintains to —the present

day.

Her appearances on the London stage included such plays as
Anouilh’s Fading Mansions, which was directed by Sir Laurence
Olivier, Janus Forsyth’s Abelard and Heloise, Shaw’s Saint Joan.
Synge’s Playboy of the Western World and Doris Tessnig’s Play

With a Tiger, among others.

Featured in numerous films and television programs, McKen-
na continues to appear in such festivals as the Stratford in both
England and Ontario, the Edinboro. the Paris, and the Florence.

She first performed, Here Are Ladies, in London and then in
New York under the auspices of the New York Shakespeare Festival

apparent anywhere than in their
faces. As Rich does his "imita-
tion of the month of February"
and Carol writhes in ecstacy. the
rapport between the two is easily
discernible and adds another
dimension to the primordial com-
munication we are witnessing.

A script which could have
easily degenerated. into Woody
Allen slapstick owes its integ-
rity to the controlled direction
of Harshbarger. and a ver_v in-
telligent use of three-quarter
thrust staging.

As the two characters stand
atop their ladders awaiting “The
orator,” the “Frankenstein” they
have created, they grope, but can

-no longer see each other, al-

though a few feet apart.

The audience- too can grope
and are as shocked by the
entrance of the "orator” as the
old man -and woman are. In a
sort of “Butch Cassidy” way
we all ask "who is that guy?”
Mark Taper as the less than ar-
ticulate orator is as intimidat-
ing as the part allows. His robot-
like state is a beautiful contrast
to the previous movement of the
play. Finally the technical as-
pects of the play, the climactic
entrance of the orator ‘are su-
perb. -

The Lesson unfortunately call-
ed on few of the techniques
that worked so well in The
Chairs. Frank Rakas as the "pro-
fessor” was extremely uncon-
vincing and his every movement

US. TV viewers get

bare factsfrom BBC

NEW YORK——(AP)-—Nude
scenes have been shown on tele-

vision this season and the bare—'

ness has caused only a ripple of
complaint. The nudity has been
limited to the Public Broad-
casting System (PBS). and com-

mercial networks say it’s'still

far off for them. .

The glimpses of nudity on
PBS have been fleeting, an inte-
gral part of the plot, and have
been set in classical productions
imported from England. The
number of protests are so few
that officials are surprised.

One station, KTSP—TV,. Ta-
coma, Washington, declined to
carry the Jude the Obscure seg-
ment of Masterpiece Theatre
series, where the nudity has
been this season, because of
what it called ‘risque scenes.’

PBS said only six or seven of
its 211 stations cut the nude
scenes from the British-made
production, before broadcast.
Several nude scenes appear in
two other segments scheduled
later this season;

"It just hasn’t been a problem.
It hasn’t stirred up anything,”
said Hartford‘ Gunn, president
of PBS. Masterpiece Theatre is
put together at WGBH-TV in
Boston.

The productions on Master-
piece Theatre were made by
the British Broadcasting Corp.
and shown over its network in
England. The British commer-
cial network also has occasional
nudity in dramatic programs.

The three American commer-
cial networks have never shown
a nude scene. '

Robert D. Wood, president of
the CBS Television Networks
said. “I wouldn’t say that
nudity will never come to com-
.mercial television. It’s like foot-
ball. It’s a game of inches. We

in seven or eight years." ~

James E. Duffy, president of if

the ABC Television Network.

said. "I wouldn’t want it on our ’

shows.’ We go into millions‘ of
homes and there are chi~ldren’s

morals and religious values to;

' The crowd was on its feet screaming, '
‘The action continued hot and heavy as the home forces applled
~ continuous pressure ‘on their outclassed opponents. The roar of
the fans increased with each passing moment until the sound
became deafening. .

Ironically the scene took place far from the gridiron where
that type of excitement usually takes place. The scene, one that
has been a rare one for Pitt fans infthe past, but promises to be-
come commonplace in the near future, took place at the Alpine
Ice Chalet in.Braddock Hills.

Out on the rink the Pitt Ice Hockey Club was serving its
Crosstown rival Duquesne, a merciless beating. Pitts’ superior
strength and size proved too much for the Dukes as the question
” soon became, not if, but by how much would the icers win.

The kind of enthusiasm that permeated the crowd of over
350 Pitt fans'was a rare phenomenon. Pitt fans haven’t had too
., much to cheer about recently. In fact, loyal supporters have
rarely found much to cheer about for a while now.

, The icers downed Duquesne handily, 10-2, led by Frank Wil-
liams‘ hat trick and promise to dominate ‘the schedule in
‘ similar manner. The only opponent ’ 
on their schedule that they don’t out-
class is Gannon College. Gannon beat
them, 7-5. ' .
Less than a year ago, a freshman
, by the name of Joe Testa came up to
the Pitt News office and asked to have
an announcement placed in the paper. '
" He was planning to form an ice hockey
team and wanted anyone interested to
contact him. His father had built the
~Alphine Chalet and Testa saw a per-
'6 feet opportunity to organize the squad.

Less than two months later, Testa’s MARK UWERMAN
dream was a reality. Untested and sorely underequipped the
-squad took to the ice against C-MU and soundly whipped them.
‘ They continued to dominate opponents for the rest of the season,
1 losing only to Gannon and tying South Park. It was a remarkable
beginning for a group of guys who hardly had time to learn each
other’s names.

Today, eight months later, the skaters boast a squad of 30
’ men secure within the confines of the Western Pennsylvania In-
tercollegiate Club Hockey Association.‘ They play a ten game
qschedule, mostly locally, and look forward to the playoffs in
‘March. _ A

     

 

The progress that the Club has made would be considered
remarkable even if it wasdone in isolation. But the squad’s en-
thusiasm has extended well beyond the boundaries of the play-
ers capturing the hearts of ice hockey fanatics all over campus.

. The growing interest in the sport has propelled the squad into
 , fourth place among Pitt’s top spectatorsports.

Transportation is a big problem,
which makes the opening night crowd
of almost 800 people an amazing total.
Mark Lieberman, the squad’s stal-
wart netminder indicates how severe
the problem is.

“I, know many people who said
they’d like to go,” Lieberman com-
mented, “but they couldn't get out
there. This was our biggest crowd
though.”

skaters from club status to one of a team is a remote one. “At

Army rebounds from   1

poor 197 0 id eaon

by MARTY HELLMAN
Associate Sports Editor

Last fall, the two eastern serv- _

ice academies, Navy and Army,
combined for a miserable. 3-18-1
record, a complete reversal of
past respectable seasons-at the
institutions. The inability to re-
cruit top prospects was cited as a
primary reason for the schools’
decline in football supremacy.

Army’s coach, Tom Cahill, be-

lieves that any problems in re- '

cruiting are beginning to ease.
"I’d like to think that the pendu-
lum is beginning to swing the
other way,” he stated at the Pan-
ther press luncheon yesterday.

“We’re getting better recep-
tions in homes lately,” he contin-
ued. ~“But all of the service aca-
demies haveunique problems in
that area.”

Cahill dismisses the Air Force’s
recent rise to gridiron strength as
a bad sign for the eastern aca-
demies. “They would like to
think that they have the edge, but
I don’t think so.”

Cahill’s problems in the past

_ year have not been limited to re-

cruiting alone. His Cadets of 1970
beat only Holy Cross, a team that
started anew last season after a
year’s respite from football. The
eventual 1-9-1 record was the
worst for the Black Knights since
1940.

Led by a strong defensive unit,
_this year’s Army team has al-
ready pulled two major upsets, a
16-13 win over Georgia Tech, and
a 22-6 whipping of Missouri. The
club enters this week’s contest
with the Pitt, Panthers with _a 4-4
record, a solid rebound from last
year. ' '

Though the. Cadets won’t come
up to Notre Dame’s size. Cahill af-
‘firms that “this is the biggest
team physically since I’ve been
here.”

ball scholarship originally-' deterred White

  
  

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

Booter John White has been kicking the
idea around in his head for a long time now and
he has finally decided’ to start kicking around
a football. ” ‘ -

. White, a soccer lineman, has officially
quit the squad and has joined the ranks of the
Panther gridders as a place kicker.

The junior from Toms River, N._J., had nev-

' ér played football before coming to Pitt but he

has always had the desire to participate in the
sport

_ “I had never played football until I~got
here,” related White. “The first time I tried to

. play was during the spring practices in my

_ freshman year in school-at Pitt. (

_ “I wentout for the team but things didn’t
work out. I had trouble with my soccer schol-
arship, and in trying to get a football scholar-
ship." ‘

The opportunity to play may not always
have presented itself to White but the desire
has always been there.

“It’s not a matter of liking football better
than soccer,” explained White. “I just always
wanted to play football. I just wanted to try’
something different to see if I could do it. ’

"I'd just rather play football than soccer.
I finally got the chance to play and I didn’t want
to pass it up."

Pitt’s soccer coach Leo Bemis was stun-
ned by White's decision to leave the soccer
team.

“I saw Coach Bemis last Friday and he
was shocked’ when I said that I wanted to play
football,” stated the ex-booter. He thought
that if I had the choice I would have played soc-
cer for the chanceto go to the (NCAA) tourna-
ment.” .

Problems with the acquisition of afoot-

     

 

 

from participating ‘in the Pitt football pro-
gram, but now he has managed to overcome
this obstacle.

“The only reasonthat I could play football
is if I got a football scholarship,” he .said.
"Coach DePasqua (Panther football mentor)
said that I could have a scholarship if I stayed.
So starting next term, I’ll be on a football
scholarship.”

White feels that _there is probably little
chance for him to do any punting or attempting
any field goals during the remainder of the
-’ 71 football campaign. '

“I haven’t been practicing (puntinglii

and field goal attempts) all year,” commented
White.“‘You‘ have to have a lot of practice and
I would have to start practicing it every day.”

To boot or not to boot, that is the question.
John White’ has found the answer and his an-
swer is football. _

Several newspaper sportswrit-
ers have ‘claimed that Pitt line-
backer Ralph Cindrich finally
reached his 1971 pre—season press
buildup in the last two Panther
football games against Syracuse
and Notre Dame. Ralph disagrees
100 per cent.

''I personally feel that I played
as well at Boston College and Tu-
lane as I did here at home against
Notre Dame and Syracuse the last
two contests,” remarked Cind-
rich. "But I would have to say
that these past two games have
been my best ever at home. in-
cluding my sophomore season.
For some reason,_ I just don’t
play too well in away games.”

Following a sparkling Home-
coming performance against the
Orangemen. the Cats were over-
whelmed by the Fightin‘ Irish in
last Saturday’s debacle. Despite
the lopsided final tally. Cindrich
insists that the gridders were "ex-
ceptionally well prepared» for
Notre Dame.”

“At times, it seems to be a
waste. Prior to every gameeach
player gets a five-page scouting
report on our upcoming weekend
opponent. Yet, one week we’ll
beat Syracuse, and get whipped
the next by Notre Dame.”

The Irish appeared to be sky-
high for the Panthers. Ralph add-
ed, “It was like playing at South
Bend for them (ND). Nearly half
the fans came just to see Notre
Dame play.” ‘

With only three games left for
him in ' his collegiate career,
Ralph is ready to take each game
in stride.

Pitt may very well, be put
through the meat grinder again in
two weeks when the Nittany Lions
invade Pitt Stadium. According to
Cindrich, Penn State has more
speed than Notre Dame but may
not be as physical as Syracuse.
But right now, he is setting his
sights on Army, for “they’re no
pushovers.” ’

With all the preseason publicity
regarding his All-American can-
didacy at middle linebacker, there
has been a great deal of pressure
on Ralph. .He makes no excuses
for his early season game per-
formances, although it is common
knowledge that his knee occasion-
ally bothers him.

.Cindrich said, “I feel that both
my own play and my lateral move-
ment have progressively improv-
ed game by game. The rumor that
I unconsciously favor my knee on
the Astroturf is untrue.”

Like his fellow linebacking mate A

Joe Carroll, Ralph Cindrich feels
much more at home in the 4-3 de-

fensive alignment. In addition, .a ”
possible career in pro football'

would depend on Cindrich’s abil-
ity to handle t_he middle lineback-
ing position.

"Although I take much more
physicahabuse as the middle line-
backer in a 4-3 defense. I can re-
act more instead of. being forced
to constantly read each offensive
formation. I think I’m capable of
handling my post in the 5-2, but I’d
sure rather be in the middle.

“If I would make the pros. it
would have to be as a linebacker.
though I don’t know if I have the
size required to play-‘in the mid-
dle. Also ,because of my knee. I’m
not sure if any pro team would
want to undertake the financial in-
vestment I might be.”

In case Cindrich should fail in
the __NFL, he has sights on either‘
law school or possibly a career in
radio or TV sports broadcasting.

A newspaperman approached
Ralph in the locker room follow-
ing the Notre Dame pasting and
inquired as to whether or not
Cindrich had any regrets on com-
ing to Pitt. The 6-1, 225 pounder,
from Avella H.S.' gave his inquis-
tor an unequivocal "No! ”

“Heck,” stated Ralph, “I don’t
know if I could have ever fit into

’Dut to financial ills. the Rifle
club could very well disband

‘in the next couple weeks. Eight

hundred dollars is needed to
pull the club out of its bleak
state.

The U.S. Army,
R.O.T.C. program at Pitt. has
supplied 12-.22 caliber rifles
and ammunition to the club.
The club was also given trans-
portation to some of its away
meets. It had no trouble secur-
ing a range to shoot at, since the
University has one of the best
rifle ranges in the East. But
with all this assistance the-‘club
still needs the 800 dollars.

The Army has taken back its
rifles and transportation funds,
but still supplies the ammuni-
tion. The reason the Army has

_ withdrawn this support is be-

cause of the lack of an alloca-
tion. _ .
Now, the Army will give
back the rifles, if the club can

vise the Army equipment. The
Army would prefer that this‘

coach be of Army personnel but
Colonel Mishtowt, head of the

that some arrangement could be
worked around this. "

Colonel Mishtowt has attempt-

but has been unsuccessful..

The interest in the club has
fallen greatly among the shoot-
ers. Of the once 24 members,

This situation’ has forced the

I .5,»-

by VINCE DiNARDO
Mario D’andrea was among the 57,000 spectators in Satur-

day's Notre Dame Football game.

To get to 'Pitt.stadium. Mario traveled in excess of 90 miles to

see the Panthers humiliated

by

the classy Irishmen.

eleven days ago. Mario made a similar trip with the Edinboro soccer

team as one of’ its talented de-
fensive fullbacks. ‘

"In that game, D’andrea watch»

ed a classy Pitt Soccer team hu-
miliate Edinboro 10-0.

D’andrea did not make the
trip to gain some revenge in
watching Pitt lose badly. He has
been coming back to Pittsburgh
to root for the Steelers and the
Pirates ever since he went to

. Edinboro State three years ago.

Mario went to High School
at Central Catholic High School,

which is five minutes walking-

distance away from Pitt. On the
way‘ home from Soccer prac-
tice at Central, Mario would of-‘
ten stop ;in Pitt’s Tuck Shop to
grab a coke before going home
to Atwood Street, his perman-
ent address.

, Even though he has been away
from Oakland for three years,
he still feels extremely loyal to
Pittsburgh’s athletic teams—all

. teams, thatis, except the Pitt
soccer team. a
“I wanted to beat Pitt,” he
saidof his trip as a partici-
pant rather than a spectator, “I

boro. attributed the loss to Pitt's

excess of quality athletes versus:

Edinboro’s upstart program. Mar-

io felt particularly responsible.

for the lopsided score.

“I’m a fullback,” he said.
“Fullbacks are supposed to pro-
tect the goal, score wise, I did-
n’t do too good a job. Pitt’s got
some really fine wings. They
forced me to do thingsyI\ ordin-
arily wouldn’t do. They -forced
me to come out of the middle to
get them and that left the mid-
dle wide open for the center-
forward. Even though the cen-
terforward'(Joe Luxbacher) de-
serves credit for scoring all
those goals, it was the wings
who made it possible—especi-
ally Gus Theofilos.”

Garry _Johnson, who is also a
Pittsburgher and was a_ team-
mate of D’andrea in High
School, plays for Edinboro and
like Mario, spent the bulk of
the afternoon chasing Pitt wings.
Johnson, like D’andrea was glad
to come back to Pittsburgh but
felt the effects of Pitt’s power
before the game even began.

“Before” this game, Johnson
said, “I was the point man on
our defense. Because Pitt’s so
good, I might be point man on
the bench instead.”

--Actually, there was no room
on the bench‘ for ‘Johnson be-
cause he was one of the players

“Now, said Shimpano, "we’re
getting more players who have

played soccer before and as at

result, we have fielded a better
team." I

Both D’andrea and ‘Johnson

fall under that category, to say,

the least. Even Shimpano would
shudder to think what the
score would have been without
them. ‘ ‘
