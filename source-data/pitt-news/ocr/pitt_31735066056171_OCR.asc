Forum on
peace in

the Middle
East opens

discussion

By Rachel Barrett
and Matt Groff
The Pitt News

Uri Shavit told the audience at the
Middle East forum last nightto realize
there is more to the peace process
than merely distributing land.

“It’s not something that’s just money

or “land,” Shavit said. “There are feel- V

ings involved.”

Shavit, a doctoral student at
Carnegie Mellon and native of Israel,
was one of four guest speakers to
address those who attended an infor-
mation session on the Middle East

peaceprocess last night. The forum, .

sponsored by a Jewish community

organization B’nai B’rith Hillel", was

aimed at helping members of the Pitt
co.mmunity have a ‘greater under-
standing of recent events in the
Middle East, according to Cindy
Goodman—Leib, who is the assistant
director of Hillel.

“The basic idea is to bring out peo-
ple from both points of view,”
Jonathan Weinkle, former officer of
Hillel, said. Weinkle said that despite
positive media coverage many people
still have reservations. Amir Hartman,
originally from Israel and now a doc-
toral student in Pitt’s Business School,
said he has doubts about the agree-
ment. “I feel Israel is not for peace but
wants to be left in peace,”, Hartman
said. “I believe [the peace accord]
came about in an anti—democratic
way.”

Another speaker, Sofiane Sahraoui,
was also pessimistic about the accord.

“Islam is a religion of peace,”
Sahraoui said.” But there are doubts
about Arafat as a good representative
of the Palestinians.”

Students sbopforjobs, trzterns/otps at seminar

By Randy Knapick ‘
Staﬂ’ Writer

Providing an opportunity to meet with
representatives from every field across the
board, the 1993 Career Seminar allowed
students to start their networking and job
hunting process early.

This four—day seminar “provides an

opportunity for students to come and talk

with people who are actually working
now,” explains Teddy Fakles, a counselor
with the University Counseling ?and
Student Development Center which spon-
sors the event.

The seminar, in its 23rd year, features

representatives from government, busi-
ness and social services who share knowl-

_ edge of their respective fields with stu-

dents. In addition, graduate and profes-
sional school representatives answer stu-

~dent’s questions concerning graduate-
A level education.

“The seminar is not a recruitment activi-
ty,” Fakles said. “It’s for the purpose of
giving students a wider perspective in
what’s available.”

The seminar informs students of the
skills required for the careers that interest
them, how to best use their undergradu-
ate years to prepare for those careers and
how to make themselves “more attractive

to employers,” he said.

According to Fakles, students can also
establish “good contacts” during the semi-
nar which may lead to internship or part-
time employment opportunities.

“Networking, making contacts, that’s a
basic tool of modern job hunting,” Fakles
said. “You can come to the career seminar
and start doing some powerful network-
ing in just one afternoon.” ‘

Each of the seminar’s four days has a.

unique theme. Yesterday, representatives
from government, law and public service
spoke with students in informal, one—on—
one discussions.

Starzl and researchers discover likely cause of organ rejection

By Brian Lehew
Staff Writer

Dr. Thomas E. Starzl and his
team of researchers said they
believe a form of organ rejec-
tion known as complement may
have been the underlying cause
of two baboon-to-human liver
transplant failures performed at
the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center.

Starzl explained, when he
addressed the Second
International Congress on
Xenotransplantation in
Cambridge, England, on
Monday, that the long-term suc-
cess of the patients may have
been jeopardized by the incom-

__ 3, ». \,. .... _,__

plete form of rejection which is
produced by the liver and other
tissues, according to the UPMC
news bureau. ‘

“The xenograft barrier is ‘more
vulnerable than most people
realize,” Starzl said. He said
what this case has revealed is
similar to problems reported 30
years ago in kidney recipients
with mismatched’ blood types.

In future xenotransplants a
new drug, which impedes the
complement response called
K76, may be added to the four-
drug cocktail used with the two
previous patients, according to
UPMC spokesperson Lisa Rossi.

Both patients were taking a

cocktail of drugs consisting of

FK-506, cyclophosphamide,
prostaglandin and prednisone.
The new drug, which is still
being used only in preliminary
trials, is made from a fungus
found in Japan.

“More than ever, cracking the
shell that prohibits the exploita-
tion of what hides inside does
not seem unrealistic,” Starzl
said. “Once in, it is clear that
cellular and vascular rejection
can be controlled  and now
the prospect seems closer than
ever.” .- ‘

The UPMC has obtained large
quantities of K76 but will have
to prove that the drug will work
in sustaining cross-species

transplants in large animals for

three months or more before
another baboon-to-human
transplant can be considered,
according to the Pittsburgh Post
Gazette. V

Both patients, ages 35 and 62,
were dying from hepatitis B
before their transplants.

The baboon is known to be
resistant to the virus, and no
signs of the virus were present
in the patients after the trans-
plants.

The first patient, a 35-year-old
man, died Sept. 6, 1992,.from
internal bleeding in the skull, 71
days after his transplant. The
second patient died earlier this
year due to an apparent infec-

tion in his abdominal cavity_

, only 26 daysafter his transplant.
Both patients showed signs of
chimerism — the coexistence of
cells from the donor and recipi-
ent ——- which is necessary for
the body to eventually accept
the organ, according to the
UPMC news bureau.

The anti—rejection drugs were
preventing the major forms of
organ rejection.

However, the underlying
complement was not affected
by the drugs.

According to the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, Pitt has chosen the
new additive K76 as the most
likely candidate of the solutions
available to eliminate this form
of incomplete rejection.

Presby

- celebrates

centennial

By Brian Lehew
Staff Writer

As the ediﬁce of a new
hospital in Oakland
began to tower above all
except the Cathedral of
Learning to the east, a
woman, according to the
archives of the communi-
cations department at the
University of Pittsburgh
Medical ‘Center, came out
to witness the progress.
Seated in a wheelchair at
age 90, she smiled.

The year was 1932. The
depression was in full
swing, and Pittsburgh was
the smoky industrial city
dubbed by Lincoln

» Steffens in The Shame Of

the Cities as, “hell with
the lid off.” '
Construction was under

. way at the University of

Pittsburgh for a medical
center. The frightening
financial times brought
with them fear that the
project, which would pro-
vide medical students
with a , clinical environ-
ment, wouldn’t be com-

pleted.
Despite the doubt that
surrounded her, Dr.

‘Louise J. Wotring Lyle

resumed the prayers that

~ proved successful in May

of 1893, when her dream,
and ﬁve dollars, founded
Presbyterian-University

Hospital.
Now in its 100th year,
Presby has risen to

become one of the
nation’s leading medical
facilities.

Called the Louise Lyle
Hospital, the original
facility opened in a dou-
ble three—story house at
31 North Sherman

1 Avenue on the North Side

of Pittsburgh.

Lyle convinced the
owner to let her slide on
the security ‘deposit and
rent her the house for $50
a month. Afterwards, she
put her prayers and her
only five dollars to work.
Upon opening the doors,
she vowed to provide
care for the -poor and.
elderly of every race,
creed and nationality,
according to Ralph W.
Harbison, a former mem-
ber of the hospital’s
media relations staff.

Seven years later the
fledgling of a hospital

moved to Manchester and ‘

expanded to 90 beds.

In 1911 it moved again
to Sherman and
Montgomery avenues into
a larger facility.

John G. Bowman, an
advocate for establishing
a medical center at the
University of Pittsburgh,
became chancellor in
January of 1921.

Defending bumom rigbtsfor all goal of Pitt group

By Mike Lyczko .
Staff Writer

Pitt students are using the power of the
pen to help political prisoners throughout
the world. ‘

“In defending the rights of others, you are
defending your own rights,” Joseph Keslar,
president of Pitt’s chapter of Amnesty
International, said.

“Amnesty International is an impartial and
independent agency working to de-
fend human rights across the world. We
work for the release of all prisoners of con-
science.”

The group’s primary tool is letter writing
to governments on behalf of political pris-
oners. Previous and prospective members
spent part of an organizational meeting

Tuesday night writing a letter on behalf
of several persons imprisoned or be-
lieved to have disappeared in Equatorial
Guinea. »

Many students at the meeting came to
learn. Others had been members in other
countries such as England. Motivations
ranged from curiosity to concern about
human rights in the world.

Students also watched a brief animated
video narrated by Jeff Daniels and Debra
Winger that reviewed several of .the 30 arti-
cles in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, which was adopted by the United
Nations General Assembly on Dec. 10,
1948.

Keslar said Amnesty International is guid-
ed by this document. Working for human
rights sounds like a grim process, but Keslar

said the group tries to have fun, too.
“This is a weighty subject, but we don't
want it to be dry and dour. The letter-writ-

ing campaigns include food such as pizza,”

he said.

Pitt’s Amnesty International welcomes
students, faculty and staff as new members,
Keslar said. There is also an Amnesty
International group based at the Law
School, he said. J

General meetings will be held about once
a month. Keslar said students interested in

. joining can leave a note in the mailbox of

Amnesty Internationals cubicle on the fifth
floor of the William Pitt Union.

Plans for this year include biweekly‘

human rights awareness booths in the
lower level of the student union, Keslar
said.

Dance Forum leaps, twirls, ts throuh T re Hall

By Courtney Chisholrn
For The Pitt News

Sharing an adoration for dance, about
40 students meet weekly to leap, plié and
twirl through the Trees Hall dance studio.

The Pitt Dance Ensemble consists of
males and females who rehearse various
kinds of dance as a group while working
on their own individual skills.

No prior (lance experience is necessary
although some of the participants did join
the ensemble with experience.

First-year student Tracey Katz said, “I
really like dancing, I have been doing it
for 15 years.”

The Dance Ensemble is a club, but it
can be taken as a class for credit as Dance
Production. Those who take the class are
still part of the Pitt Dance Ensemble.

The group is instructed by Susan Gillis—
Kruman. Occasionally professionals come
in to teach the class in their particular
area of expertise. Students are also
exposed to forms of dance they may have
never been introduced to before.

“'l’ve taken (lance all my life, and I real-
ly wanted to pursue it. I just thought that
this would be a fun activity,” Stephanie
Simpson, who is enrolled in the Dance
Production class, said.

Some participants View the ensemble as
a nice change of pace from their daily
routines. “It’s a break from regular class-
es, and it really relaxes you. I enjoy it a
lot,” Katz said.

The ensemble also offers aspiring

choreographers a chance to show their 
talent. Many of the students choreograph . 
routines that the ensemble performs.

“Besides getting to know other people
with dance experience, we get a chance
to choreograph our own ideas,” Julie
Harrison, who has been with the ensem-
ble for a year, said.

“I have been dancing since I was eight
years old, and the dance ensemble is
a good way to review different tech-
niques.”

The ensemble is always moving for-
ward ancl doing new and different things,
according to Harrison. “Sometimes when
people see the title Dance Production [in
the course catalog] they don’t realize that
we actually do all dancing. It’s like a real
studio,” Harrison said.

The Dance Ensemble travels as a group,
and it does several performances
throughout the year, according to
Harrison. “We have a convention in
December at Seven Springs which we are
preparing for now.” she said. “At the con-
vention we perform once and take class-
es. The convention is our big event for
the year.”

Besides the trip in December, Harrison
said the group also has an annual perfor-
mance in April. Participating in the Dance
Ensemble offers those who are interested
a chance to practice their favorite areas of
dance, as well as explore new areas. ,

Katz said there is definitely variety in  
the course, “Some weeks we do jazz or
modern, other weeks it’s tap or ballet.”

Career

Continued from page 1

The representatives answered
questions and described career
opportunities in approximately
20 government and public sec-
tor agencies, including the
Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Internal Revenue Service, State
Police, City of Pittsburgh and
State Civil Service Comission.

Students who come to the
seminar can ask specific ques-
tions that classroom instruction
and university counseling typi-
cally does not addressjoan M.
Lauth from the Internal Revenue
Service discussed opportunities
within that bureau.

Lauth said students “wonder
about the types of jobs we have.
People feel there is security in a
government job.” In addition to
offering job security “advance-
ment in government jobs is usu-
ally faster than in private indus-
try,” Lauth said, although gov-
ernment jobs usually have
lower starting salaries.

Lauth said students wanted to
know if the IRS was hiring but
were generally optimistic about
the job market, even in today’s
stmggling economy.

Don Prohaska of the Federal
Aviation Administration sought

to “provide encouragement” for _

students interested "in aviation
careers. “Aviation is in its‘infan-
cy, and the industry is still
expanding,” he said.
Additionally, the diversity of
aviation allows professionals of
all kinds to enter the field. “It’s
like having" two separate.
careers,” Prohaska said.
Prohaska also stressed the

 

importance of interships to the
students. Internships allow stu-
dents to taste careers before
making serious commitments.

“Even if you’re not interested
in a field, you can intern,” he
said. “Then if you decide not to
enter the field, you can leave
without an impact on your life.
Plus, internships look awfully
good on your resume.”

Arlene Mercurio of Pitt’s
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs noticed a
difference between the
“younger students” attending
the seminar and those who
attend graduate school fairs.

Mercurio -said that many stu-
dents at the seminar, especially
first— or second—year undergrad-
uates, were “‘exploring” and
using the seminar to decide on
a major. “They have not made
up their minds. I was more of a
counselor today than a
recruiter,” she said.

Mercurio spent much of her
time explaining the role of the
public sector. “Students know

Peace

Continued from page 1

Shavit and Alex Orbach, an associate profes-
sor in religious studies at Pitt, both spoke with
cautious_optimism about the peace agreement.

According to Orbach, even though the pact
is a mutual recognition agreement, the impli-
cations are much greater. “I feel this is a posi-
tive step because the international world com-
munity now recognizes the Palestine
Liberation Organization and a negotiation
process can begin,” Orbach said. “The alterna-
tive to negotiation is terrorism. With the sup-

port of the American president and the world
community, talks can progress rather than mil-
itary confrontation.”

“It has become clearer and clearer to me that
there are two people and two nations who
want exactly the same land,” Shavit said.
“There is not a complete solution, but we
should give this agreement a chance.”

Weinkle said he is attempting to form a spe-
cial interest group within Hillel. The group,
Hamagshimim, will advance students’ under-
standing of Israeli interests. I

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, Sgtember 29, 1993

Continued from page 3
In October of the same year
the University purchased the
H.K. Porter estate, due west of
the Cathedral of Learning, and

established plans for a new

medical center.

Ironically, 100 years earlier,
Robert Bruce, the first chancel-
lor at Pitt, expressed a similar
hope for a medical ‘center west
of the Cathedral of Learning in
his inaugural speech.

“To the west, a college for

~ physicians and surgeons will
' here long be eagerly looked for
.4 and hailed as a great benefit,”

he said. .
According to William

McClosky of UPMC’s communi-

cations department, theplans

called for an outside hospital‘

to establish itself on campus,
and therefore, provide a clinical
setting for Pitt’s medical stu-
dents. .

The land was leased for con—
Presbyterian
Hospital of Pittsburgh for one

dollar —- an offer too good to
pass up.
On Feb. 10, 1927, the

two entities officially linked and
started a campaign for funds
at a dinner at the University
Club. _

At the same time, the
Women’s Hospital (now Magee—
Women’s Hospital) and the Eye
and Ear Hospital agreed to
occupy the east and west wings
of the complex.

Presbyterian Hospital were
eager to complete the project,

Hospital Bulletin.

Lyle died before the new hos—
pital opened in 1938.

When the hospital celebrated
its 50th anniversary in 1943, the
bed capacity of the university
hospitals and its affiliates was at
4,044 and growing.

In 1949 hospital trustees
signed a new affiliation agree-
ment with the university and
redefined its mission as one of
patient care, education and
research.

In 1961 the hospital was
renamed Presbyterian-
University Hospital.

Since then the hospital, which
is now the central facility of the
University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, has pioneered research
in the areas of neurosurgery,
organ transplant and cancer
treatment.

Presbyterian has grown from
the infancy of a duplex home
into. early adulthood. On
Presbyterian’s 50th anniversary
a hospital spokesperson, Hugh

Thomson Kerr, said, “It will
never be complete. It is a grow-
ing, expanding and enlarging

Major step

In termsof the standings in college football this year,
there hasn’t been a lot for Pitt fans to cheer about.

Although Pitt does have some promising players, the
outlook for the rest of this season is not a very bright
one. Pitt is set to face some tough teams on the remain-
der of its schedule, starting this coming Saturday with
the visiting Louisville Cardinals. .

But even though the prospect that Pitt fans will be

0 Watching their Panthers in‘ a nationally-televised bowl

game at the end of this season is very unlikely, Pitt fans
do have something to cheer about. I

John Majors, the new Pitt Panther head coach, is
arguably one of the best football minds in college, foot—
ball today. -Just ask any football fan who was around .in
1976, the year Coach Majors lead Pitt to ‘a national
championship. Already, the press has been predicting
successes down the road for Pitt football once again. '

More importantly, Coach Majors not only has a strong
commitment to his players and to winning football
games, but he is also very committed to the Pitt com-

1 rnunity in general. He has made a point to reach out to
students for team -support, and beyond that, he

attempts to instill a certain pride in our university.

Assuming that the stress on academics is not jeopar— .

dized in the process, this is something Pitt needs.

Majors also shows an interest in the Pittsburgh com-
munity as a whole. Writing a weekly column in the
Trz'bLme—Reuz'ew, and hosting a television talk show dis-
play this interest. a

Majors is a definite assetto Pitt, and his presence and.
attitude can beneﬁt the University of Pittsburgh both in
image and reality. '

imany tirnes when’ people " hear about'Pitt,‘ they hear

about crime in Oakland and administrators throwing
moneylaway. John Majors is once again part of the
community and is showing that Pitt’s image could and
should be a very positive one. If we follow his exam-
ple, Coach Majors’ attitude can bring our university to
greater heights. ' /

Students having dinner last night in the Tower C cafe-
teria had the opportunity to meet and speak with
Coach Majors when he stopped by to sign autographs
and joke around with them. Some of those present
were appreciative of the opportunity to talk with him

for a short time.

Majors has made it a point to reach members of the
university community at various gatherings, especially
students. ‘

Majors said he realizes it’s tough to root for a losing
team. He said he appreciates all the support he gets
and only asks that everyone will hang in there with
him. He also urges students to say hello to him when
they pass him in the street.

Pitt has a common interest in rallying around its foot—
ball coach and its team. It can -benefit in ways not often
thought associated with football. 0

Thanks for BAS support

The Student Environmental Action
' Coalition would like to thank the
Black Action Society for its statement
of solidarity in the struggle to preserve
Mt. Graham in Arizona. It is important
for student and community groups
throughout the Pittsburgh area to unite
against Pitt’s possible involvement in
this project.

As notedin the letter by the BAS, the
Mt. Graham International Observatory
violates the First Amendment rights of
the San Carlos Apache Nation to free-
dom of religion and also destroys valu-

» able ecosystems containing several
species that are federally listed as
“threatened” and “endangered.” As if
this weren’t enough, the sponsors of
the telescope project ‘have admitted to
“miscalculation” in their original pro-
posal and have to reapply with the
U.S. Forest Service to move the tele-
scopes half a mile to another peak on
Mt. Graham. This lack of forethought
_and planning will set the project back
at least a year or two and shows a
complete lack of understanding of sci-
ence by the project sponsors. Do we
want Pitt to tarnish its reputation by
becoming involved with this farce?

Our organization allies itself with the
BAS in its struggle for ethnic diversity
and understanding. It is through this
cooperation that progress will be
made in making this planet a better
place to live. V

I - SEAC member

Rebuttal to University of Arizona

I would like to refute
two statements made by
the University of Arizona
spokesperson Steve
Emerime in Scott Carpel’s
Mt, Graham article (Sept.
27, Me Pitt News).

First, Emerime stated
that there is no danger to

the endangered red squir— -

rel and said that the num-
ber of squirrels has
increased in the past four
years. “

But he choose the low-
est point in red squirrel
population as a base year,
but the reason the squirrel
count was so low that
year was because the
cone crop (main staple of
the red squirrel diet) was
at an all-time low.

Emerime picked the
most suitable time and
text to support his claims.

What he fagéd to say
was that in the last three
counts, the red squirrel
number has plummeted.
The long-term survival of
the endangered red squir-
rel depends on the life of
the spruce and firs whose
cones support them, The
Mt. Graham telescope
project - has forever
destroyed one—fourth of
that support system.

The fact is the continual
encroachment by the uni-

versity will result in the
extinction of the red
squirrel and all the preda-

tors who feed on them
,like the Mexican spotted

owl and peregrine falcon.
Another
Emerime’s deceptions

was after he stated that -

this project poses no
threat to the endangered
red squirrel, he then goes
on to say, “We [the UAl
are working withthe tribe
and the forestry in hopes
to ease access because
the red squirrel is an
endangered species.”

Let me see, the UA can
build two mammoth
structures and a road in
an area that is too sensi-
tive for a medicine man to
enter in order to pray.

This is just an example
of the subterfuge that the
UA, .in particular Steve
Emerime, has been spew-
ing for years.We cannot
base a multimillion dollar
decision on the shaky
facts in the UA’s sales
pitch.

Whether it is for ethical
reasons or sensible busi-
ness practice, we must say
no to the UA and look
elsewhere to invest.

Walking into “The Coach’s”
new office is an experience in

' itself. '

His desk, housing a thick
stack of applications filled out
by prospective recruits, sits
caddycorner to a long table
with college stationery at one
end and a box of cigars at the
other.

Two chairs, a filing cabinet
and a coffee maker still in its
box makes up the remainder of
“The Coach’s” decor.

Behind the desk sits “The
Coach” himself, gnawing on
one of his stogies while talking
to a possible: recruit on the
phone. The young man called
the coach directly because,
wouldn’t you know it, “The
Coach” has no‘ secretary.

He also has no weight room,
no_lockers, no field, no uni-
forms, and particularly, no
team.

And ladies and gentlemen,
“The Coach” is having fun.

_. endand defensive end at Pitt,

Joe Walton has found a home

in Coraopolis, Pa. The Beaver V
_Falls native is loving his new

job as the first head coach of

the Robert Morris Colonials, ;
which will begin play in NCAA \‘

Division I-AA in 1994.

“I wanted to stay close to.
and that was what,
attracted me [to'Robert Morris],” 3
_Walton said. “I was contacted

home,

by few pro teams for different

positions, and nothing really,

interested me at the ‘time.
When [the RMC positionl came
up, it seemed like the ideal
fﬁtch, because it’s 20 miles
away from my home, and its a
big challenge.”

Walton, who was much
maligned during his seven
years as head coach of the
New York Jets and two as

offensive coordinator of the ,

Pittsburgh Steelers under Chuck

Noll, is in a unique position at ;

RMC.

With only his defensive coor-
dinator, former Steelers offen-
sive line coach Dan
Radakovich, to help him,
Walton must do an enormous
amount of work in helping

RMC'prepare for its first year of '

competitive football.

be playing their home games in
1994 at nearby Moon High
School’s football field, and their
uniforms, equipment and other
necessities will arrive in due

Joel Walton hopes to start a football tradition in Coraopolis.

“Right here [at RMC] we
probably have about 26 [stu-
dents] who are interested in
-coming out for the program,”
Walton said. “And we also have
about 20 kids that are going to
other schools, whether it be
Pitt, Slippery Rock or Whatever,
who are interested in'transfer-
ring hereto play football,
'We’ve sent out questionnaires
to high school kids, and we
will proceed to call them all.

“As we go along, it's going to
take a lot of time.” 9

But if Walton learned any-
thing during his career at Pitt
from 1955-57, hard work ‘and
tenacity were right at the top of

the list.
Walton’s playing days at,Pitt

‘were during the bygone era of

ironman football, when each
man on the field played each‘

offense and defense. And few
played this role better than
Walton, who was twice select-
ed as a unanimous All-
American at both tight end,
where he would later shine in
the NFL, and also at defensive
end.

A sign of good luck for Pitt’s
soccer team? ‘

Maybe, but the Panther’s 2-2-

2 record is more a sign of
inconsistency than one of tarot
cards and crystal balls. Pitt has
won its last two games — its
first two wins of the year -
and is looking ahead to today’s
matchup at St. Francis to break
the even mark for the first time.
“How about ‘we’re progress-
ing?”’ sweeper Bob Dyer wryly
said.
“We’re pretty happy about

good game agaisnst St. John’s
then a bad one against Buffalo
 but we’re pretty happy with
what’s going on.”

5‘W'e’re getting better defen-
sively, but we have to improve
on offense,” assistant coach
Chris Karwoski said.

“We’re wasting a lot of good
opportunities. They’re getting
their chances . . Eric Prex,
Dean Astorino and Eric Duffy
 but they’re not putting them
away. We want to get ahead
and play a good control game.”

The defense — outstanding
in its last three games with only
two goals‘ against ——~started
very slowly and prompted a
change, not_ only in the sweep-
er position, which Dyer moved
back to after the third game,
but also in the most important
position on the field — goalie.

“I’m not putting the blame on
any one person, but the
defense was playing shaky, so
we figured we’d go with Kirk
[Brodows] against Seton Hall
University,’f [Karwoski said. “He
deserved it and did a phenom-
enal job.”

.“It’s not [former starting

3 goalie-Adam] Spitzer’s fault but

 it happened to Kurt last year
 the team needed a change,”
Dyer said.

“The team needed a jolt, and
that's when the change needed
to be made. Kurt and Adam are

.. pretty equal as goalies.”

Inconsistency on the ﬁeld has

Majors "recruits" at Towers

By Cory Walborn
Staff Writer

Johnny Majors walked into

the Tower C cafeteria last_

night with a bad cold.
His face was flushed, his
nose was clogged, and he

- was trying to shake a nag-

ging cough.

But the Pitt football coach
was there. And to the 30 or
so that obtained his auto-
graph and chatted with Pitt’s
legendary head ma'n, the
sniffles and cough were no
problem at all.

Getting in touch with

"another Pitt generation last

night, Majors was cordial to
all that approached him in
this informal autograph ses-
sion below Tower C.

“Hi, I’m John Majors. How
are you?” Majors often said
while greeting a student or
cafeteria employee.

That was followed by
Majors’ handshake and smile
or a hearty or bashful, “I’m
fine,” by the autograph
seeker.

“What’s your
Majors then asked.

“Where are you from?”

name?”

Majors then proceeded to
say.

The answers told the
coach ranged from the
North Hills to Bethlehem,
Pa., to Mississippi.

“I’ve been there,” or “I
know exactly where that is,”
he replied several times.

“What’s your major?” the
caring coach said.

Hearing pharmacy and
engineering a couple times,
Majors barked out, “We got
a" lot of smart peeple here.” ’

When the line died Majors
stood up with a smile.

“I’ve met a lot of great
people since I came here,”

Majors said. “And now I get.

to meet a lot more.”

He met more friends who
are just extremely happy to
say hello to Pitt’s new/old
coach. ' _ ‘

“He’s the man that can
bring back Pitt [football],”
cafeteria \ employee John
Fechke said after talking to
Majors. “We need him.”

Then as Tower C cleared
out, Majors left for the
warmth of his home.

He now has to take care
of his lingering cold.

Elected captain
as a junior,
Campion is
ready to take
rugby to next

level

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

“Gimme 10 pushups, and
we’re gonna keep doing
pushups until this drill is done
right,” a voice said. .

This voice can be heard fre-
quently during rugby practice.
Many people would automati-
cally think it was the rugby
coach who administered this
tongue-lashing.

The voice belongs to junior
Dave Campion. Campion is the
captain of the team and is also
one of its best players.

Campion became involved
with rugby as f1rst—year student
when he came to Pitt.

“I was walking behind the
Cathedral [of Learning], and I
saw a bunch of guys running
around,” Campion said. “I had
to ask them what sport they
were playing. I decided to give
it a shot and ended up starting
my freshman year.”

Campion’s play dramatically
improved during his sopho-
more year. In fact, it improved
so much that he was invited to

Captain Dave Campion pushes Pitt rugby with fiery leadership

the Midwest national tryouts at
Ohio State. Campion did so
well that he was asked to the
next level of tryouts in Denver,
Colo. '

“I wasn’t able to attend the
second tryout,” Campion said.
“But I got to play with some of
the best talent in the country.”

At the end of last season,
Campion was chosen by his
teammates to be this season’s
captain. E .

_ “There was no leader last
year,” senior Adam Brennan
said. -

“Dave was the most motivat-
ed which made him the perfect
choice  it also helps that he is
a great player.”

A “Intense,” is a good word to
describe the kind of player
Campion is. He is an intense,
vocal leader whether it is a
game or practice.

He feels practice is equally as
important as a game.

“_I expect the players to work
as hard as they can at practice,”
he said.

"‘Every individual is impor-
tant. If one person is lagging, it
hurts the entire team.”

And when someone is lag-
ging, Campion lets them know
it. A
“I’ll let them know what
they’re doing wrong, but I
won’t put them down,” he said.

Brennan said that Campion is
a “big yeller,” but that the team
“wouldn’t go anywhere” with-

out his leadership.

During games, Campion
cranks his intensity up another
level.

“He leads by example,”
junior Neil Scott said.

“When we see him out there
busting his butt, it makes the
entire team play that much
harder.”

“I have a heavy load to
carry,” Campion said. “We have
a lot of young players this year.
My responsibility is to set a
good example.” - I

Dave’s work ethic and lead-
ership has helped him earn the
respect of his teammates.

“Dave is in charge, I and

3-.

everyone knows it,” Brennan
said.

“Last year the players con-
stantly argued and fought with
each other. We don’t have any
of that this year.” I

The end of the arguing and
the emphasis on team plays
which Campion instills has led
the team to a 2-0 record.

“You can’t be an individual
and be successful in this sport,”
Campion said. -“The team is far
more important than any one
player.” V

Campion does have a few
personal goals, among them,
national recognition.

' “By my senior year, I want to

 ‘ll

be an All-American,” he said.
“If I work hard, I think I’ll have
a good shot.”

Another goal is to make A

rugby more popular at Pitt.

“Rugby is becoming more
popular across the country,” he
said.

“Not many people realize
that there is a rugby club at
Pitt."

The team has started the sea-
son at 2-0 and has gained
national recognition. Under the
leadership of the fiery
Campion, the rugby. team can
be sure its going to do its fare
share of pushups .., and win-
ning.

Waltorr

Continued from page 8
of accomplishments, both dur-
ing and after college, is end-
less.
And to think that one of the

7 all-time Panther greats was

"almost not a Panther.
After his years as an All-State

7 fullback at Beaver Falls High

School, no one dreamed that
Walton would play football at
anywhere other than his
father’s alma mater. Frank

“Tiger” Walton was an All-

American guard at Pitt from
1932-33, and it was generally
assumed that young Joe would

" follow in his father’s footsteps.

After a tour of the Indiana
University campus, however,

.Walton surprised everyone by

deciding to play football for the
Hoosiers.

But just weeks before he was
to enter Indiana, Walton’s
father was stricken with what

,was to be a fatal illness.
_ Joe did not think twice and

enrolled at Pitt. On the first day
of classes, his father passed
away.

“People always say that
things work out for the best,”
Walton said. “Losing my dad
was a bad time in my life, but
itturned out that Pitt wasa

good thing in my life. It was a
very exciting time [for me]. I
was going through the trials of
not having my dad. I had a
younger brother, my mother
was on her own, and I became
more than just a college stu-
dent and a son. I was also
almost like my brother's father.
There were a lot of things that
changed for me [during] those
three or four years.

‘‘[My father’s death] hurt me
for a while, but I think that
being involved at Pitt and
being involved in football pos-
sibly helped me get through
that period.”

And it didn’t hurt the pro-
gram, either.

Walton’s career at Pitt took
off in the 1955 season when he
led the Panthers in receiving
and set, a school record by
hauling in eight touchdown
receptions.

However, the one thing that
sets Walton’s feat apart from
the others is that he caught a
total of only 16 passes because
first-year head coach John
Michelosen’s 1955 Panthers
employed a rather conservative
offense. .

* After that 1955 campaign

. which saw the Panthers go 7-3,

Walton and crew were invited
to the Sugar Bowl against
Georgia Tech — Pitt’s first bowl
appearance since a 21-0 victory
over Washington in the 195
Rose Bowl. . -

Walton was regarded as one ' ‘

of the finest tight ends in the
NFL during his career. He was
drafted 14th overall in 1957 by
the Washington Redskins,
where he played for four years
before being traded to New
York Giants before the 1961
season.

Walton received much recog-
nition during his years with the
Giants, where he was referred
to by Hall of Fame quarterback
Y.A. Tittle as “the best third-
down receiver in the game 
bar none.”

After finishing his career with
178 receptions for 2,623 yards‘
and 26 T Ds, Walton coached in
the NFL for 25 years with the
Redskins (1974-90), Giants
(1969-73), Jets -(1981-89, head
coach 1983-89) and Steelers
(1990-91). , »

He faced several challenging
years with the Jets and Steelers,
having to regularly. listen to
chants of “Joe Must Go” and
“Where’s the ‘O,’ Joe?” from
crowds of over 50,000 people.

Joe Walton was a two-time All-American at Pitt.

It’s interesting to think that
perhaps his greatest challenge
will be at a small business
school in a little town on the
outskirts of Pittsburgh.

“Football is the kind of game,
playing and coaching, that has
its ups and_ downs,” said
Walton. “You have some good

times and some bad times.
[Looking back] there isn’t any-
thing I would change, because
that would be changing myself.
I’m not going to change myself.

“Right now the future is
what’s important to me.”

And the future looks bright
for “The Coach.”

team with great guys who are
always supporting each other,”
Doherty said. “Traveling with
this team is going to be a lot of
fun.” \

But Doherty knows that he
may be in for a rough first year
in college tennis. .

“Playing number one is a
tough spot because a lot of
teams have tough number
ones,” he said.

“I could get blown out a few
times, but I’ll have some good
wins as well.”

Although Doherty talks of
getting blown out, he seems
confident that his style of ten-

nis will lead to more “good

wins” than losses.

“I like attacking,” he said. “I
hate being on the defensive.
When I’m attacking, I’m in con-
trol, and [my opponent has] got
to hitlshots to beat me.”

Doherty’s attacking serve-
and-volley tennis is not, how-
ever, indicative of his on—cou1t
demeanor.

“I’m calm on the court. I
don’t really show emotion at
all,” he said. “I play my best
when ,I’m under control and
nobody knows what I’m think-
ing.” .

In yesterday’s match with
Duquesne Doherty suffered his

first collegiate loss 5-6,‘ 4-6 to
Tom Kirk. But he lost playing
his game —— attacking.

“He was just the more pre-
cise attacker today,” he said of
the defeat, which was not a
blow out by any means.

The “good win” came later in
the match when he teamed up
with Brad Wade for a 6-4, 3-6,
6-3 doubles win against
Duquesne’s Todd Hrabek and
Ed Leal, which broke a 4-4 tie
and gave Pitt the win.
