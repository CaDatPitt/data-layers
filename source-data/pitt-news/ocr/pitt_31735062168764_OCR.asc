Letter to Dr. Posvar

Let Us Work Together

A new era began at the University on Friday at 10
a.m. A young academician with a diverse background,
Dr. Wesley Posvar, agreed to take the helm of state.
The University now enters a new period stability under
Dr. Posvar’s leadership. We the students of the Univer-
sity hope to work with the Chancellor to continue to
build this institution into an international center of
learning. We hold the following goals as essential for
this accomplishment.

.> Maintenance of High Academic Standards——We
should increase the faculty to achieve an optimal stu-
dent-faculty ratio. The presently overcrowded classes
and poor schedule selection might well cause serious
student alienation. We should continue to follow the
pattern set by the Andrew» Mellon chairs of bringing in
outstanding faculty from all parts of the world.

> Maintenance of a Cosmopolitan Student Body:: We
must question the recent statements by outgoing Board
Chairman Gwilym A. Price that the “goal should be to
make Pitt a really ﬁne regional University.” While the
University must serve the region, at the same time the
administration must continue to attract studentsfrom
all parts of the nation and the world. Speciﬁcally in the
future, the Admissions Department must work to main-
tain and out-of-state ratio which will be at least one-
third of the student body.

> Improved Student Recreational Facilitie": During
the past year we were able to show the shabby con-
dition of our Student Union to Chancellor Kurtzman.
Dr. Kurtzman promised that a new Student Union
would be built and that student opinion would be incor-
porated at every step of the planning of the new struc-
ture. We feel it is imperative that this pro; ect be given
top priority in the University’s master plan. .

> Continuation of the Chancellor’s Open Door Policy:
The Chancellor’s office has never been as open to stu-
dents as it has been under Dr. Kurtzman. He has met
with student leaders on a regular basis’ and has had
weekly meetings with a representative of the student
newspaper. Only through such meetings can the Chan-‘
cellor communicate his thoughts to students and learn
of student opinion. ‘

We do ot come only with demands. We come in a
spirit of cooperation, ready to work with the new Chan-
cellor to discuss these ideas. Our experience with the
Chancellor this past year has been a positive one. We
pledge all our efforts for the achievement of our central
goal—the building and strengthening of our University.

Differ Over SG Philosophies

, Student Government (SG) Vice-President candidates
Thomas Meisner (A.R.A.) and Terry Hyman (P.P.P.) dis-
cussed various aspects of their opposing philosophies of gov-
ernment during a program broadcast over campus radio sta-
tion WPGH yesterday evening.

Meisner cited the gains made
by the current SG administration
concerning “a ﬁrm commitment-”
from the University for a Stu-
dent Union and also the results
obtained by student leaders in
the campaign to clean up the
present Union. He promised that
if elected, his party would “go
beyond these achievements next
year. We are not trying to fool
you.” He promised to work for
“genuine student needs.”

Meisner saw" “no need for .a
10.per cent amusement tax” for
student events and stated that
he would use the elimination of
the sales tax for text books as a
precedent.

Continuing, Meisner asked: “Do
you think it is right that the ad-

ministration sits in on student
meetings when the student ii-‘
nanced activities fee is being al-
located?” In this spirit, he de-
manded the removal of adminis-
trator John Vrana. from the Al-
locations Committee.

Meisner contended that “a
small elite meets in Dean Rush’s
office and decides whether a stu-
dent organization has the right
to exist.” He attacked the Rec-
ognitions Committee as a “clamp
on our freedom,” and suggested
that the committee be abolished
or revamped. '

Hyman argued that “the PPP
has a different idea of the type
oi‘ SG needed,” and has “realistic
and attainable goals” to make the

Stephen Foster Memorial
Packed For Doctor’s Talk

When every seat in the house.

was gone, women lined the floors
and stairs of the Stephen Foster
Memorial social hall, recently, to
hear Dr. Sylvia Wechsler, a
Pittsburgh gynecologist. Upon
reaching the podium, Dr. Wechs-
ler quipped, “I don’t know what
you girls expect; never saw such
a mob in my life, but I'll do my
best.

What the women “expected"
to hear at the meeting sponsored
by AWS was largely answers to
questions on birth control pills,
their safety, effectiveness, and
moral use.

Dr. Wechsler emphasized that
pills are safe, do not cause mul-
tiple births and that the Federal
Drug Administration permits doc-
tors to prescribe them at their
discretion. “First generation chil-
dren of women using pills,” said
Dr. Wechsler, “are from all ap-
pearances normal.”

“Birth control pills at least of
the eight preferred varieties to-
day, are 100 per cent effective in
preventing conception,” she con-
tinued, and at that point pulled

ective?

out some samples of “the pill”
enclosed ‘in variously designed
compacts. “Each company tries
to out sell the other with fancy
packaging,” she noted, “until you
nearly need an engineering de-
gree to open them. Nonetheless,
if you take them as directed, you
will be in good shape—literally.”

When asked if she condoned
pre-martial sex. Dr. Wechsler
said that she could not tell others
what to do. “What you feel is
right, what you feel is degrading
is a personal matter,” she an-
swered. “Just remember, don’t
ever hurt yourself. No one is
more important than yourself.

“I would prescribe pills, how-
ever,‘ for girls having affairs,”
Dr. Wechsler added, “because if
a girl has thoughtfully decided
that she is doing right, I would
rather she take pills than go
through the agony of illegitimate
pregnancy. Abortions are not a
dime a dozen; there is too much
heartbreak involved. If a girl is
honest, there is no reason for
her not to have pills.”

Problem Dis cussedAt WPDU Debate

by PAUL STOLLER

The United States has been
giving foreign. aid to emerg-
ing nations for many years.
Yet, has the American ‘for.-
eign aid program been effec-
tive? This question was the
topic of a keynote address given

by Senator Joseph S. Clark (D.,

Pa.) before the participants in

the William Pitt Debating Union .

(WPDU) Annual High School De-
bate Tournament. The address
was presented last Saturday in
the SU ballroom‘ of the Univer-
sity._ '

 

facing the world today. “The ﬁrst
problem,” stressed Senator Clark,
“is the population explosion. The
world's population is now dou-
bled since 1945. To put this in
perspective, you might consider
that if we began with two peo-
ple at the time of the birth of
Christ, this growth rate of two
per cent would have furnished
the world with 20 million times
as many people as it has today
or 100 people per square foot.
“Food is obviously the most im-

mediate problem» posed by the’

population explosion,” according

to Senator Clark. The Senator‘
_ decried, _“_In our affluent society‘

f Metr d

  

 ’must be—-generated fin

      

prehend the enormity of the fact
that about 10,000 people in this
world die of starvation each day.”
Clark continued by stressing the
fact that “without massive Unit-
ed States food aid, millions of
Indians would be in danger of
starvation.”

' The third pressing world prob-
lem that Senator Clark empha-
sized in his address was the sit-
uation of world poverty. “Nearly
a billion human beings have an-

ﬁlial. average per capita _income

of less than $100.” I
The senator believed that “self
sustaining economic _ growth U _can

9-.3 t,1.‘ie.$ B.

  

well as local resources and initia-
tive.”

Having discussed world prob-
lems, the Senator turned his at-
tentions to the solutions of these
problems. “Of ﬁrst priority,”
stated Senator Clark, “is to in-
crease our assistence to a level
commensurate with our respon-
sibilities as the richest and most
powerful nation in history. If aid
from the rich to the poor is to be
decisive we must pour a much
greater, ﬂow of materials and
skills into these countries; pro-
vide more aid on easier terms;
open our doors wider to their

‘products, and have far greater’
ipatie.

 

  

than .'.\.?V.ex have, shown ; up

  

University “a better place ‘ in 

which to live and learn."

Hyman attacked the University -_.
for making decisions ﬁrst and _-.
forcing students “to react to these“
decisions” afterwards. He cited ‘,

the decisions concerning the pro-

posed dormitories on the hill, _
changes in Saga’s food service,"

and the trend of “larger and
larger classes.” '

Hyman charged that “student.

leaders did not effectively ex-

press student opinion,” but that‘

 

on the other hand, he did not ex
pect “SG to tell the administra
tion how to run the University’

 

but should be a part of the de- '

cision-making process. He said

that “members of the administra-:.-_

tion are not students, and they
can’t possibly have the same

views and attitudes as students; 1"-_—
Student views must be articulate-

ly stated,, stated with vigor.”

Hyman stated that student af- :

fairs are decided “over a cup of

tea in Dean Rush’s office,” and -

argued that student affairs should

be decided by “students sitting

‘ together without the Dean of Stu-
dents.” ' -
He said that students shoul

have a say in their “own des- '-
tiny.” “A vote for PPP is a vote
for yourse .” .

 Memorial Banquet

Retiring Chairman of the
* Board of Trustees Gwilym A‘
Price was honored at the

- First Annual Stanton C.

Crawford Award Banquet
sponsored by Theta Chi so-
cial fraternity. The dinner which
students, faculty administrators
and community leaders attended
 was held Friday night in the Stu-

T dent Union Ballroom.

In accepting the Crawford Me-
"morial Award, Price recalled the
_contributions Dr. Crawford has

made in his 40 year career at the
, University. Refering to Dr. Craw-

ford’s brief tenure as Acting
5 Chancellor, Price said, “Few peo-
,ple could have stepped into the

breach of leadership as well as
‘ Stanton Crawford did. After his

40 years of service he had en-
" deared himself to everyone. Only

he could have held this Universi-
’ ty together.”

~ Praise was also given to Theta
-Chi for innovating the idea of
. the Award Banquet. Chancellor
-' of the University, Dr. David H.
’KurtzrEa‘n, said, “Theta Chi de-
_ erves recognition for this new
venture. I am impressed with
.their initiative and I hope this
‘j event will set a pattern for other
types of activities.”

-Similarly President Pro Tem-
pore of the State Senate, Sen.

Robert Fleming stated, “This din-
ner will become one of the out-
standing events in Western Penn-
sylvania.” Refering to Board
Chairman Price, Sen. Fleming
said, “No man did more for the
University in a period of crisis.
It is largely due to his efforts

that the University is state-re-’

lated. Western Pennsylvania owes
a debt of gratitude to this dis-
tinguished citizen.” .
Price had served as chairman
of the Board since 1959 and has
"also served as chairman of the
Board of Directors of Westing-
house Corporation. Former~ sec-
ond Vice-Chairman of the Board

   

C}. A. Price Receives Award

William Rea has taken over
Price’s position among the Uni”
versity’s trustees.

Theta Chi plans to present the
Crawford Award annually to the
citizen who “has shown, by his
actions, a sincere devotion to the
pursuit of excellence and growth
of the University.” Proceeds from

_ the annual affair will be contri-

buted to the University.
Other speakers at the dinner

* - included Mayor Joseph Barr and

Ralph Manning, president of Stu-
dent Government. Dr. Donald G.‘

‘Fahrenheit 45 1 ’ Technically

‘by HOBART HARRIS
Fahrenheit 451 stars Os-
~kar~Werner and Julie Chris-
.tie, who plays in two roles.
~.It is directed by one of the
finest directors in the world,
-Fransois Trouffaut. It is
very nearly an impeccable
«movie-—and that is the prob-
lem.

_ The situation is familiar to any-
“one who has read 1984, Brave
;New World or a similar work.
.England in the near future is
ruled by a regime that forbids
the reading of books. Conformity
“r enforced on the grounds that
people .are all equal, and should,
-therefore, have the same inter-

ests, feelings, and, most of all, 1

ideas. Intelligent reading is, of
course,“ contrary to these goals.
, ~, W.erner plays the ﬁreman, Mon-
tag. The ﬁreman’s job is not to
xtinguish ﬁres, but, instead, to
et them. Theiﬁre brigades are
‘called to houses where books
have been discovered to burn

‘f"3them, which they do with a
" ‘maximum efficiency.’ 9‘

Julie Christie plays both Mon-
tag’s wife, Linda, and a neighbor
girl, Clarisse. Linda is the slave
‘ if her culture-—she is completely
uninfaginative, glued to ‘her tele-
vision screen, hardly aware of

the world or her husband. She
can’t even remember where she
and Montag met.-

Clarisse is just the opposite.
She is vibrant, alive, and most
of all, aware of Montag as a feel-
ing person. Montag himself slow-
ly becomes fed up with his job,
and the society that would need
such a service. Ehrentually he be-
gins reading the books that he’
is supposed to burn, and becomes
a criminal. ,

Fahrenheit 451 is most obvious-
ly a movie with a message for its
audience. It is calling for a spon-
taneity in life, a freedom to ex-
press your deepest feelings and
doubts at will, and without fear.
Book burning is‘ just a symptom
of a deeper psychosis, and Trouf-
faut presents enough scenes doc-

umenting the undersurface ten-

sion of the society toxmake his
point. ' _

However, this is where the
problem of casting comes in. Os-
car Werner is perfect in his.part.
He stalks across the screen with
an unbroken expression of deep
concern. H-e exudes sensitivity.
He is a hybrid of Abraham Lin-
coln, Sir Thomas.Moore, Winston
Churchill. Such a man would re-
ject a repressive society of any
nature. In other words, his char-
acter is a set-up for the message
that Trouﬁant has chosen.

The same canvbe said for the
two roles that Julie Christie
plays. Each one is clearly deﬁned;
each character is perfect for its
role in conveying Trouffaut’s
ideas. '

Only one thing remains-of
course, these people will react
the Way they do. Of course, a
man of Montag’s character will
revile the system. But would any-
one else? Werner is so perfect in
his _part that it is comparable to

impeccable;   But Still Falters -

ple for playing baseball. Would
Oskar lWerner revolt in. such a
society? '

More importantly, would; the
great mass of people, the mass

/ which democratic society is de-
signed to serve, ﬁnd Montag’s
bookless society repulsive? This
is a question that Trouffaut, by
and large, failed to answer. I
think it would have been better
if characters more representative
of the great mass of real people
were used.

Using Werner as Montag, and
Miss Christie as Clarisse/Linda,
Trouffant made the movie a lit-
tle too cut and dried. Without
being facetious, if Trouffant could
have cast Soupy Sales or George
Hamilton as Montag, and Julie
Andrews in Julie Christies place,
I would have been more inclined
to agree with Trouﬁant’s ideas.

  9 ‘Class of "70 Member .;

Has Many Attributes

The Collegiate Press Service

The average member of
the class of 1970 is a white
protestant from the North
Central region of the US who

attends church regularly '

(though drinks beer on the
side), has a B to C high
school average, and intends
to get a graduate degree with

-an undergraduate major in en-

gineering, business, or a pre-pro-
fessional subject.

These statistics were released
by the American Council on Ed-
ucation, based on information
from 206,865 freshmen at 251
colleges and universities. The in-
formation,
data collected later, will be used
to evaluate changes in students’
behavior during college.

. Parents of this current fresh-
man are likely to be high school
graduates with a gross family in-
come of $10,000-$15,000. They
will be the major source of funds
during his freshman year.

This freshman considers him-
self above ‘average in “academic
ability,” “cheerfulness,” “drive to
achieve,” and “understanding of
others,” and his most important
objectives are to “help others in
difficulty,” “be an authority in
my ﬁeld,” “keep up with political
affairs,” and “succeed in my own
business.”

Impressions of their new col-
leges Had already been formed
when students completed the
ACE questionnaire during their
orientation period. Naming char-
acteristics “very descriptive of
the atmosphere of the college,”
over 60 per cent said “realistic.”
Fifty-six per cent said “warm,”

in conjunction with A

50.6 per cent “practical-minded,”
44.4 per cent-“social,” 39.9 per
cent “liberal,” and 34.6 per cent
“intellectual.” Only 1.8 per cent
felt their college was “snobbish,”
and 3.9 per cent “Victorian.”

Less than half of the students
thought there would be “great
pressure for high grades,” but
56.3 per cent expect “keen com-
petition for grades.”

Five per cent of freshmen in
all types of institutions are Ne-
groes with the highest concentra-
tion——12.9 per cent—in private
non- sectarian. colleges. Private
two year colleges have the smal-
lest per cent of Negro students,
one-half of one per per cent.
There are slightly more women
than men among Negro students,
although 54.3 percent of all en-
tering freshmen are men.

might have been better for
the Panther basketball team
if their season had ended
with last week’s win over
Lafayette. At least that way they
wouldn’t have suffered through
the incredible drubbing inﬂicted
by Penn State Saturday.

Even the ﬁnal score of 84-44
doesn't describe the cagers’ utter
futility. More importantly, the
numbers don’t show the lack of
hustle or the absence of drive.

Coach Bob Timmons expressed
it best following the grateful
sound of the ﬁnal buzzer. Stand-
i g in the corner of an almost
s amefully silent dressing room,
he said, “They realize they did a
poor job. But they didn’t seem
to care t'o~do anything about it.
They were content to take the
loss today.”

The ﬁrst three times the Pan-
thers had the ball they lost it
without taking a shot. With that
pattern established, they proceed-

1

. alike,’
V “Tih,ey"C'oi

ed to turn the ball over ten more
times in the ﬁrst half.

While this was going on, Penn
State was asserting its height
advantage underneath both back-
boards. Bill Stansﬁeld at 6-8, and
Paul Mickey at 6-9 were in firm
control.

All of the Lions’ ﬁrst 20 points
were scored within 10 feet of
the basket. Stansﬁeld could not
be stopped by the Panther de-
fenses. He hit on short jump
shots, on an assortment of bank
shots, on tap-ins, and on crowd-
pleasing dunk shots. Stansﬁeld’s
18 points in the ﬁrst half were
more than the entire eager out-
put

When State left the court at
halftime with a 33-17 advantage,
none of the 4,300 students in the
stands doubted that the Lions
had their 30th consecutive home
victory safely tucked away.

They only questioned how big
the win would be.

Even though Penn State played
most of the second half without
their leading scorer Jeff Persson,
they hardly missed him. Persson

had been held by Pete Smith to

just two foul shots in the ﬁrst
half and his replacement, Gary
Hayes, was hot.

Another pattern was set after
the intermission. Hayes would hit
from way outside, Joe McGovern,
at the other guard, would drive
through for baskets, and Stans-
ﬁeld would pop from inside the
key.

With the difficult Penn State
zone, the Panthers were forced
to crash their offensive boards,
which made it even easier for
the Lions to break downcourt
three on one or four on two.

Swimmers Tie Orangeman, 52-52;
Lane Stars, Wins Three Events -  

by JAY KAPLAN

With the swimming sea-
son barely underway, John
Lane has already started
where he left off last year. Lane
took ﬁrsts in the 500, 200, and
100-yard freestyle events to en-
able the swimmers to tie Syra-
cuse, 52-52.

Lane broke the school record
in the 100-yard freestyle by one
full second when he was clocked
in 49 seconds ﬂat. The old record

.was held by Tom Ribarchk and

Andy James. In the 200-yard free-
style, Lane nearly broke another
school record as he was timed
in 1:50.6, just two tenths of a
second off the old record.

Coach Jerry Snyder knew if the
mermen were to win, they would
have to take the ﬁrst event, the
400-yard medley relay. The team
consisting of Joe LaViere, Gene
Hoffman, Howie Norris, and Gary
Martin coasted to victory, giving
them a 7-0 lead.

After this win, the team fault-
ed, winning only one of the next

Ed Peery’s Navy Wrestlers
Manhandle Matmen, 31-3;
Hoover Gains Only Victory

by ROY JACOBS
In the years 1955-7, Ed Peery brought credit and pride
to the ‘University as a three-time NCAA wrestling champion.
But Saturday Peery only brought the school humiliation. _

Perry humbled the varsity
wrestlers by guiding his Navy
matmen to a 31-3 Win at the Field
House. But he didn’t do so with-
out at least a little remorse about
the score.

“I feel bad about it,” said
Peery afterwards, “but it’s just
that we’re up right now and Pitt’s
down.” Somewhat reassuringly,
he added, “There’s a lot of po-
tential there. And remember, the
season’s still young.

“Hoover did a nice job. And
Shildt and Trax did nice jobs
against good boys.”

On the other side, varsity coach
Dave Johnson wasn’t as liberal
with his complaints.

“We showed no improvement
over last week. Too many guys
gave up.

“Hoover came back well. I was
worried about him a bit, but he
found out he could win and did
it.”

Unfortunately, Terry was the
only one who did. He had watch-
ed eight wrestlers before him
lose, and two-thirds of the way
through his 191 pound match
with Navy’s Terry Allen, he was
losing too. '

With 2:07 remaining, however,
Hoover managed a reversal on
Allen, and used the Navy ride to
ride out the match. His extra
Gym Squad
Loses Again

The gymnastics squad posted
its best score of the season,
148.30, but its best didn’t bring it
close against Syracuse, which
scored 165 points. Dennis Engle
of Syracuse took two ﬁrsts and a
second for the best individual
performance in the meet.

Coach Warren Neiger was sur.
prised" at Jim Sacco and Bob
Dodsons one-two ﬁnish on the
parallel bars. Sacco scored 8.45
in this event, followed by Dod-
son’s score of 8.4. -

Dave Shidemantle again led
the gymnasts with a tie for ﬁrst
in the long horse vault, athjrd
in the trampoline, and a third in
the ﬂoor exercise. Ig Perez and
Sacco tied for third in the side
horse event. '

_ Neiger Said, “We are improv-
mg score-wise as a team and some
of the boys are coming along

two points for a riding time ad-
vantage gave him a 5-2 decision
and the wrestlers’ only three
points.

It was the second consecutive
year the varsity could only man-
age three points against Navy.

Indicative of Navy’s overall
strength is the fact that in all
seven of their decisions, the Navy
wrestler was awarded an‘ extra
two points for riding time. The

other two victories came on pins.

ﬁve events. But Norris, Lane, and

LaViere combined for four con-

secutive ﬁrsts to pull ahead again,
48-40.

Coming into, the next to last
events, the swimmers needed only
four points to ensure a tie and
ﬁve to guarantee a victory. Bar-
low from Syracuse won the event
with Hoffman and Chris Price
coming in second and third re-
spectively. - \

That gave them at least a tie
going into the last event, the 400-
yard freestyle relay. Syracuse
won it, tying the meet.

Overall, Lane proved to be by
far the most impressive swim-
mer in the meet as he complete-
ly dominated his events. LaViere
looked strong in both the 200-
yard backstroke and-the medley
relay, as did the Norris twins in
their events. 9

Frosh Cagers Bank   ,
Sixth Straight, 90 — 52+ 

Coach Tim Grgurich had his freshman basketball team 
pull more switches than a railroad yardman, and the result 

was an easy 90-52 win for the cagers at Johnstown on Sat-_

urday.

Last time the two teams met,
at the Field House, Johnstown’s
slow-down offense had kept the
contest reasonably close, with the
frosh pulling away in the last
few minutes for a 60-39 win. ‘

To counter the slowdown on
Saturday, Grgurich employed a
switching defense, which con-
fused the Johnstown attack, and
allowed the frosh to pull away
early. 9

When the frosh scored, they
used a zone defense. When they
lost the ball‘ without getting a
bucket, they employed ‘a pressing
man to man. “It really fouled
them up,” said center Charlie
Hunt, “and we were able to
break it open real quickly.” 9

Adding to J ohnstown’s troubles
was the fact that the frosh hit a
good percentage of their shots,
and dominated the boards. V

Of the Cub starters, Bob Pe—_

trini lead the scoring with 19
points, while Rob McFarland

‘You've got of problem

Here it is 1967 and you have to decide what 1967 will be like. Why? Because

your next critical career decision is at hand. Perhaps you already have a basis

for the choice. Or does it still 1-ook like a gamble?
We’d like to help you make this decision?

Have you been told the world is built on steel? or coal? or uranium?

Maybe it is.
But that’s today’s world.

You have to be thinking about t0m0rr0w’s world.

And that world is being built on molybdenum.

Supersonic aircraft?
Moon missions?
Breed-er reactors?

VVe’re talking about unusual containers. Try to build themwithout Mo.

Acrylonitrile?
Nylon 6/ 6?
Denitrogenation? 7

VVe’re talking about synthetic ﬁbers and air pollution. For the catalyst, try Mo.

Bonded coatings? .
Sealed mechanism?

Cryogenics?

We’re talking about lubrication ‘under extreme conditions. And you’re right, we’re

talking about Mo.

It’strade-in time

Like the one about business. Especially
big business. That it is beyond the rugged
individualist’s wildest daydream to enter
this holy of holies because he’ll lose some-
thing that’s very sacred——like his inde-
pendence.

Sure, it can happen. If a guy or gal
wants to hide, or just get by, or not accept
responsibility, or challenges.

We’re not omniscient enough or stupid
enough to speak for all business, but at- a
company like Western Electric, bright
ideas are not only welcome, they are en-
couraged. And no door is shut. Create a
little stir, go ahead, upset an old apple-
cart (we replace shibboleths at a terriﬁc
pace — we have to as manufacturing and
supply unit of the Bell System — in order
to provide your Bell telephone company
with equipment it needs to "serve you.)

There’s an excitement in business. True,
we’re in it to make a proﬁt, but working to

for tired old myths.

ﬁnd new and better ways to make things
that help people communicate is very re-
warding and satisfying. Did you ever hear ‘

"these wry words of Oliver Wendell

Holmes?-_.‘~,‘Never trust a genera1ity—not
even this one.” ’

That’s how we feel about the generality
that claims you’ll just become a little cog
in a company like Western Electric. You
might, of course, but if you consider your-
self an individual now, odds are 10 to 1
that you’ll keep your individuality. And
cherish it. And watch it grow. Even at big,
big Western Electric.

You know, that’s the only way we’d
want you to feel. If you feel like coming
in with us.
