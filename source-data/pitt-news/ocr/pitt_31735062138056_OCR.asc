Leaderlessﬁand
Plays For Hop

Ferde Grofe Fails To Appear But
Show Goes On

Ferde Grofe, nationally known band
leader, who was under contract to the
Soph Hop for a personal appearance
at the Urban Room Friday evening,
failed to appear for his scheduled per-
formance. The orchestra was direct-
ed by one of the members of the
band,

Grofe’s failure to appear in person
constituted a breach of contract, as
interpreted by Theodore W, Biddle,
assistant dean of men and graduate
‘manager of student activities. A com-
plaint ha.s been registered against
Grofe through the Musicians’ union,
and a reduction of $50 has been made
in the orchestra's compensation,

A complete ﬁnancial statement will
be available by Friday, according to
Ernest Rose, business manager of the
Hop.

The noted maestro’s disappearance
came as a complete surprise, even to
the members of his orchestra.

Marie Callahan, girl vocalist of
Grofe’s band, when asked about the
leader's whereabouts, said:

“I haven’t the slightest idea as to
where Mr. Grofe is.”

Hicks To Speak Before

Institute, This meeting is open to

Dr, Hicks’ speech will feature meth-
ods in which X-rays have been used
to reveal the arrangements of atoms
in the solid state and the aid which
this knowledge has given to research

Promises Improvement

With over half of the classes re-

turns of pledges show a decided in-
crease over last year.

According to W. VV. Me-ndenhall,
executive secretary of the YMCA the
Student Chest promises to exceed the

amount collected in 1933.

The ﬁrst class to report was Eng-
lish lz under the chairmanship of
Marguerite Swank, C35, which report-
ed 100 per cent pledging, 26 students
in the class pledging $22.50.

Most pledges are set for December

‘Join Activities’,
Says Spooner
To Engineers

Lack of aggressiveness and lack of
personality traits, were blamed for
the failure of many engineering grad-
uates after graduation, by Thomas
Spooner, assistant director of research
of VVestinghouse Electric company, in
his address to the electrical‘engineer-
ing seminar.

The engineering student should de-S

vote more time to extra-curricular ac-
tivities, Mr_ Spooner declared, even
though he loses time in his technical
studies. “These activities develop
traits of personality necessary to suc-
cess.

Mr. Spooner, basing his talk on an
extensive study of successful and un-
successful engineers, found that “in-
variably" the personality factor was
the dominating cause. He added:
“The technical training was usually
present but. it seldom had very much
to do with obtaining a permanent po-
sition.”

The outstanding fault with research
engineers is “lack of aggressiveness,”
the speaker asserted. “Too often they
are content to plugsawayvatvthe same
old job for the same old salary with-
out looking toward future advance-
ment or attempting to improve by out-
side rcading or study.”

This is a predominating fault even
in the successful group, Mr. Spooner
said.

"HE QUESTION has been raised

many times in the last few weeks
as to the duty of a women’s organi-

argument, strangely enough, has
taken a decidedly ethical tu1'n_ That
is to say the question is now revolv-
ing about the amount of good and the
amount of bad that will come to the
organization through publicity.

But unfortunately not all questions
have an ethical side. Not even Solo-
mon could ﬁnd a right or wrong side
to many of the questions which are
brought up in the groups, discussed,
action taken, and forgotten as far as
women outside the executive commit-

Women are a minority on the cam-

the interests of all women on campus.
Through its far-reaching committees
the problems of curricula. change,
high scholarship, the adapting of’
freshman women to the campus, the
keeping of old and the building up of
new traditions are being worked out.
Its power has come through its very
organization of class representatives

And yet this elaborate scheme of
interdependence has not evolved over
night. Experiments were made in its:
organization before the present high
plan was reached. Even now the
process is far from completion, accord-
ing to the leaders, These present
forms have evolvedifrom past forms.
Systems that didn’t work were dis
carded for systems thatrdid. Com-’
mittees that didn't ﬁll a deﬁnite need
on campus were dropped.

But the process of organization is
not yet completed. It must change
to keep up to the standards of mod-

its function. Because they look at
the organization in an unbiased man-
ner, women outside the activity very
often have the best suggestions to of-
fer for revision, addition or abolish-
ment. But people can't suggest
changes for an organizations when
they know nothing about the organi-
zations’ plans and attempt at self
change. and reform. It is only by the
respective bodies making known to
the women on campus the attempts
they are making in an endeavor to
reach a perfection in the organization
that a channel through which sugges-
tions may come can be established.
As this channel the campus newspa-

Heinz House Is Open

ONIGHT MEMBERS of Mortar
Board, honorary activities fra-
ternity for senior women, are enter-
taining women of the professional
schools with a dinner at Heinz ‘House
to be followed by a visit to the Pitt
P1a_ver’s production. This affair is
more important than it social nature
indicates, The purpose is to make
the women in the schools of La\v,
Dentistry, Medicine, and Retail Train-
ing acquainted with Heinz House, and
impress upon them that the house is
open to them for purposes of study,
entertainment, and acquaintance.
Heinz House was dubbed the House
of Amicitia in a recent hearth cere-
mony given by members of the YWCA
to acquaint freshman women with it.
In that ceremony a ﬂame was kindled
that represented the friendship and
cooperation existing among campus
coeds. Now that the freshmen have
already become acquainted with the
place, it is ﬁtting and appropriate
that Mortar Board welcome off-cam-
pus women to Heinz House and all
that that house has come to mean.

'I‘o the male student it is a house
on a hill, a wooden one at that, To
the woman student, who has gathered
around its hearth to chat, to plan, to
study, and to dream a little, it has
become a second home: a home which
offers friendship and understanding.
Tonight Mortar Board will offer that
friendship and understanding to the
woman that has her classes high up
in the Chamber of Commerce building
or way up the hill in the -School of
Medicine and give these women a

Michael Foot and John Stafford
Cripps came to Pittsburgh all the way
from Oxford university in England to
win a debate against a University
team last week; they stayed long
enough to praise American movies,
the Cathedral, and local hospitality.

The debate was held at the Schen-
ley high school before a medium-
sized crowd-of students and members
of the Foreign Policy association of
the city, which sponsored the event.

Israel Goldberg, C36, and Winston
McConkey, C35, who upheld the nega-
tive side of the question, “Resolved:
that the abandonment of an isolation-
ist policy is essential to American
economic recovery,” were themselves
abandoned by the audience, which
voted Oxford the victory on a change-
of-opinion ballot.

Both sides of the question agreed
on a number of points. “Trade is
trade,” said Goldberg in trying to de-
ﬁne the issue.

The Oxonians almost rose to extend
a vote of ,thanks on that one,

“In ‘Clever1and_la,st night,” Foot said,
“Western Reserve wouldn’t even ad-
mit that.”

On opening the rebuttal, Goldberg
attempted to prove that American
economic e-xpa.nsion——especially the

necessary and impractical. He said:

"Colonies are foster children at
best; they give an abundance of trou-
ble and end up by being pretty nasty
to their foster parents.”

“You’re telling us,” quoth Foot.

After the debate, a.n informal gath-
ering of debaters and University stu-
dents took place at a nearby restaur-
ant during which it was found that
the United States and England differ
little in fundamentals.

"V'v’e like American movies best,”
Foot admitted_ “They have a swing
a.nd a timeliness which our producers
cannot seem to imitate.

“Our favorite actress? Well, Mae
West is very popula.r—especially at
Oxford_ And Mickey Mouse, of course,
is always Welcomed at the cinema.”

“English cigarettes,” commented
Cripps as he lighted an American-

made one, “are composed entirely of
Virginia tobacco. Yours, I notice, are

made of blends which include Turkish
leafs. And yours are not nearly as
mild as ours.”

Paralleling our attitude toward the
Phillipine islands is the typical Eug-
lish one in regard to India.

“India will get her independence as
soon as she is ready for it,” Cripps
stated. “She is not yet ready.”

Richard Murphy, instructor in pub-
lic speaking and coach of -the fresh-
man debating squad, asked the Oxoni-
ans if there is any such thing as an
“Oxford accent.”

Foot of Oxford . . . “You’re telling us!”

“ls it true that‘ English students
enter certain secondary schools which
attempt to develop the same accent
and enunciation which is supposedly
typical of Oxford?” he inquired.

“There is no such thing as an OX-
ford accent,” Cripps insisted. “Our
language differences are as pro-
nounced as are those of northern and
southern or eastern and western peo-
ple in this country.”

Foot disclosed that the term “pub-
lic school” refers, in England, to pre-
paratory schools which are in no way
public. “They are the most private,
expensive, and exclusive of all.”

Social - Mindedness
Marks Student t
—Pearlman

By Raymond R. Pearlman
No one will deny that a very palpa-
ble change in the curriculum of most
universities is being effected at a
rather tremendous rate. This change

ﬁcation in the purpose of a college
education. Colleges were founded, in
the United States especially, with the
underlying presupposition that a stu-
dent would pursue courses in the lib-
eral arts and would work with mate-
rial “of a more human character.”
However, this is decidedly not char-
acteristic of present day trends,
There has been a shift—and a very
good one at that——~from the humani-
ties to the social sciences, to sociology,
to economics and to political science.
We hear the continual cry that Latin,
Greek, and philosophy, are dead is-
sues—the cry no doubt of rationalizers -
who know no Latin and less Greek.
If, however these studies are not dead,
they are surely moribund.

In the New York Times of Novem-
ber 11, I read an article defending the
study of Latin and Greek: “As is
true in all colleges,” it expostulated,
“there is a much smaller number
electing Latin and Greek now than
there was ten years ago, but those
who are taking them are ordinarily
the better students The popu-
larity of the sciences is tending to
throttle interest in the arts.”

The article continues to defend

ardently the pursuit of classical

studies_ Now we all know that an in-;
stitution, when it needs defense, isi
decadent. We read these articles?
from time to time, and arebeginning

to realize that they are pleas from

professors who are waking up to the

fact that their jobs are not so secure

as they were 20 years ago. But what

interests one primarily in dealing with

this change are two fundamental

questions. First, what is the reason

for this change and second, what re-

sult will this change bear upon our

society‘?

The second question is by far the

more important; yet the ﬁrstpoint,

the reason for the change, is signiﬁ-

trends of American collegiate learn-
ing: men and women, are, at the pres-
ent time, more so than before, attend-
ing college with a practical attitude in
mind. College curricula are present-
ed to them and they in turn are se-
lecting courses which will best pre-
pare them to earn a livelihood.
Courses in the “belles lettres,” in the
classical antiquities, in Latin, in
Greek, in philosophy are fundamental-
ly cultural courses, and are being
neglected by an ever increasing num-
ber of students. (I might add here
that the trend away from Latin is
probably due to the recent recogni-
tion that English is based almost as
much on the French as on the Latin
language. The steady decline
teaching Latin and in

indication of the validity of the above
hypothesis.)

It is with the second point however,
that I am more concerned—with the
result of the shift from
learning to the social science ﬁeld_ It
is my belief that this shift will have
a tremendous revolutionary effect
upon the shaping of our society. Uni-
versities are no longer turning out
the so-called “cultural nincompoop,”
the dilettante, the pseudo-intellectual,
the incroyablo, knowing little, if any-
thing, of the socio-economic factors,
but only the cultural elements of our

chance to have a meeting place for
study or relaxation. M. R.

‘Things Different
In China,’ Writes
Mines Alumnus

 

University alumni ﬁnd their place
even in China, according to the latest
letter received by Robert M. Black,
head of the department of mining,
from a former Chinese student.
Tseng Hsien Hao, who received his
master’s degree from the University
in 1924 is now commissioner of the
Construction department in China.
He writes: “Things have been so
much changed in China as well as in
the world at large that what I had
experienced in America six or seven
years ago seems to be in another
world altogether. Most of us took an
active part in the last revolution and
we are surprised ourselves to ﬁnd that
we have become more or less respon-
sible members of the present govern-
ment instead of expert mining engi-
neers as we were trained to be.”

In the rest of the letter Mr. Hao
tells of his friends who also got their
master’s degrees at the University in
1924 and 1925. Tsu-Yen Chen “has al-
ways been secretary to General
Chiang Kai—shek and is more respon-
sible than anyone else for the steer-
ing of our party, Kuomintang.”
Hseuh Yi Yeh is of the Central Poli-
tical committee of the Chinese repub-

-lic and Pen Chun Hsu is secretary to

the National Construction committee,

Institute Discoveries
Show Science’s Levities

Did you. know that false teeth,
combs, compacts, fancy jars, trays,
victrola records, yo—yos, and colored
glasses come from the same sub-
stance? Vinylite is this most re-
markable material discovered by the
Mellon Institute.

The lnstitute has had unprecented
success in discovering products in the
Iield of organic synthesis. Welded
blowpipes, lining varnish, telephone
receivers, are lamp carbons, stellite
tool-wrenches, the Lynde oxygen
cylinder, carbon discs, carbon grind-
stones, “B” batteries, ﬂashlight cells,
and electric motor brushes are only a
few of the other developments in this
ﬁeld.

The present organic synthesis fel-
lowship, which is the largest in the
Institute and supports seven fellows,
two company chemists, nine assist-
ants, a stenographer, and a secretary,
was founded in 1914 to further re-
search work in acetylene. After a
time, it was found that “ethylene”
could be made cheaply by a new pro-
cess. Ethylene is the equivalent of
“mustard gas” used in the World war.

are daily coming in contact with pov-

“of the other half,” is obvious, It is
inevitable that they become radical;
I might add, that I believe a majority
of them do have proclivities toward
radicalism. Thus, too, it will be with
the thousands of students who will
graduate in the near future. They
will be intellectuals novi generis, and
will be the protagonists of the Amer-
ican Revolution of 19??. Thus. one of
the fundamental doctrines of our lib-
eral social philosophy, the doctrine of
mass education, will defeat its own

purpose.

Banks Upholds Free Speech Right

 

Says Attitude Of Entrenched Capitalists, Communists
Similar In ‘Dangerous Element’ Drive

B
HE OTHER EVENING one of

y Edwin Banks

Mr. William Randolph Hearst’s

newspapers ampliﬁed its campaign against the “dangerous ele-

ments” in the United States.

This time, declares the editorial, not

only adult radicals should be deported but college student agitators
should be “thrown out of the country.”

Before Mr.‘Hearst advocates

involuntary emigration for our

insurgent youth any further, he might well delve into the early his-

tory of our republic as well as into¢
that document he is. supposed to
uphold, the Constitution. A little
study on this line might cause the
noted publisher to pause and reﬂect
—if Mr. Hearst is interested in paus-
ing and reﬂecting_

Every student of Amercian history

knows that the whole political phil-
osophy of the American Revolution
was based on the “natural right” of
a people to change its form of govern-
ment when it so desired. Every stu-
dent remembers that classic opinion
of Thomas Jefferson, author of the
Declaration of Independence, that it
is good for a nation to indulge in av

revolution every nineteen or twenty
years.

And even M,r. Hearst has read and
quoted a certain amendment in the
bill of rights to the Constitution.
Vvhen the NRA suggested that the
newspapers of America have a code
drawn up ﬁxing minimum wages and
maximum hours for reporters and
other members of the editorial de-
partment, Mr, Hearst was one of the
publishers who howled the loudest
against such a violation of the Con-
stitutional right of free speech.

‘ Perhaps, therefore,~ collegerstudents
may still be patriotic Americans in

every sense of the word if they utter
protests about features of our pres-
end political and economic order.

‘The Tuesday editorial expressed
violent aversion to the Communist
System of government, one mam.
festation of that system Mr. Hearst
must RDDFOVG although he has not so
declared. The Soviets, too, believe in
suppressing all criticism of their gov-
ernment, They, too, are practicing a.
policy of oppressing “radical agita-
tors” by sending-them—~"where they
belong.” The only difference between
their method and Mr. Hearst's proposal
is that they call their opposition “cap-
italists” and that they do not take the
trouble to throw the offenders “out
of the country."

This columnist does not favor Mr.
Hearst’s a11d Russia’s policy. He pre-
fers following the free speech guaran-
tee of the American Constitution,

—-Carnegie Tartan Cartoon.

Checked by Babelian counsel in a project to raise a clock tower into

the Oakland skyline which the Cathedral commands, Carn-egie.Tech’s stu-‘
dent government body has rejected plans to start construction.

To have cost $30,000 and to have been the object of student labor, from

blue prints to brlcklaying, the tower was fostered last year by the Carnegie
Tech Tartan, student weekly newspaper.

over charts and ﬁgures for that Mechanical
Engineering degree makes a fellow pretty
tired at timcs——but smoking Camels helps a
lot,” reports David Jarvis. “When I feel
my alertness and energy slipping away, I
light a Camel. In no time I lose that ‘all in’
feeling. I like the taste of Camels better, too.
It is a fact that Camels are difr"erent——richer,
milder. And I can smoke them one after
another without ever bothering my nerves.”

Lithuanian Committee
Submits Room Plans

Plans have been submitted to
the Lithuanian committee for the
Lithuanian Memorial room in the
Cathedral but no decision has
been made regarding them.

The Lithuanian government
sponsored a contest recently for
the honor of designing the room,
but among seven entries only the
pfaiis of A. Gudaitis were con-
sidered acceptable,

The plans of Mr. Gudaitis were
sent to the committee‘ by the
Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, but the committee thinks‘
the plans for the classroom should
be more historical and less mod-
em,

The decision is now at a stand-
still with the committee chair-
man, P. Pivaronas, transferring
responsibility to Mrs. Ruth Craw-
ford ‘Mitchell, adviser to the na-
tionality rooms for the Cathedral.

Mrs. Mitchell, though believing
the committee should render the
ﬁnal decision, plans to consult
the University’s architect on the
drawings.

Outcast Stove Pipe
Gives Last Shower

“After me, the deluge” was a
little gem tossed off by Louis XV
many, many years ago. ,Louie
minced no words_

N. Robert Seidle, assistant to
the dean of men, led himself right
into that deluge this week. It
was all a problem‘ of plumbing.

In Mr. Seidle’s oﬁice, Room 801,
Cathedral is an innocent little
stove which has done noble serv-
ice during the cold wintry (lays
Now it's a social outcast
—-a despised and untrusted ob-
ject.

As the famous rushing result
prognostic-ator leaned in his
swivel chair the other afternoon
the heavens (or rather the over-
head hot water pipe connected
with the stove) opened and gentle
drops of sizzling water seared
his handsome head of hair. Drop
by drop the water fell in little
driblets into all portions of the
office and the Seidle pressing
bills took a decided upturn.

The stove and piping are now
being moved to another portion
of the room where their‘ future
faux pas will cause less concern.

Score Victories Over Foes

Panther Cubs Defeat Penn
State Yearlings, 13-0
As Stapulis Stars

By William K. Trosen

A much heralded and cocky Penn
State freshman football team found
the Pitt frosh much tougher than they
expected and, when the ﬁnal gun
sounded last Saturday afternoon at
the State College football ﬁeld, found
itself nursing its ﬁrst setback of the
season, 13-0. The “little Panthers"
administered the defeat in a very
thorough manner.

Clicking both offensively and de-
fensively for the first time this sea-
son, Coach “Skip” Gougler’s boys de-
cisively outplayed their lighter but
highly-touted opponents from State.
From early in the first quarter, when
the little Panthers scored their ﬁrst
touchdown, the State eleven could do
little but attempt to hold the score
down and hope that one oftheir
passes would bring a score,

As it was, only once did the Penn
State team threaten the Pitt goal-line.
That was late in the second period
when two 15-yard penalties and two
completed forwards gave the State
frosh three successive ﬁrst downs and
the ball on the Pitt 15-yard line. On
the next play, however, their advance
was quickly stopped when Michelosen
intercepted a State pass on the Pan-
ther 5—yard line, and State’s lone
chance of scoring during the after-
noon was over_

The Panther’s ﬁrst score came in
the middle of the ﬁrst period, Stapulis
started the march by racing around
left end for 15 yards, following that
by a. short pass to Souchak, good for
‘Stapulis again took the
ball, this time off-tackle, romping 10
yards before being downed. O11 the
next two plays, Stapulis and Urban
carried the ball to the 3-yard line,
from which point Patrick dove across
the ﬁnal marker for the touchdown.
S0uchak’s try for the extra point was
wide. The score, remained 6-0 at the
end of the half.

After a scoreless third period, dur-
ing which the little Panthers were in
possession of the ball most of the
time, the ﬁnal quarter opened with
an unexpected exhibition of the Pitt
frosh team's power. With the ball on
the Panther 40-yard line, Stapulis
dashed around right end and up the
side line to States 40-yard line, a run
of 20 yards. Patrick advanced the
ball three yards, and on the next
play, Stapulis faded back and heaved
a 20-yard pass to Souchak, who raced
the remaining 17 yards and crossed
the goal line standing up. Souchak
booted a perfect placement for the
extra point, making the score 13-0.

The Penn State game closed the
current season for the Pitt freshman
football team, the Panthers’ record
consisting of two victories, one de-
feat, and a tie. They defeated the
Tech Plebes, 12-0, and the Penn State
frosh, 13-0, were defeated by Kiski,
13-0, in a big upset, and tied the
powerful West Virginia team, 14-14,
after trailing up to the last period,
14-0.

Notes On State

The weather was just about perfect fol
football, with more than a thousand support-
ers cheering the State team on.

Frank Souchak, regular end and acting cap-
tain, played a swell game but was rewarded
by constant riding during the second half by
the fans. It seems as though Souchak argued
too much, and had too much pep for the hos-
tile rooters.

Souchak’s, “Atta baby," while coming out
of the huddle, could be heard throughout all
parts of the wooden stands.

Junior Varsity Grid Team
Scores 25 To 6 Victory
Over West Virginia

 

Keeping pace with Pitt varsity, the
Pitt junior varsity swamped the “Test
Virginia “B” team last Saturday aft-
ernoon at the Morgantoxvn stadium
by a score the same as the one by
which Pitt walloped Nebraska at
Lincoln the same day, The victory
gave three Pitt football teams a clean
sweep in three games played last Sat-
urday.

It didn’t take the “B” team long to
start their scoring habits at Morgan-
town. In the ﬁrst quarter Trogleone
broke loose on an off-tackle play and
scampered 52 yards for a touchdown.
A few minutes later, Dougert duplicat-
ed the -play, running 65 yards for the

second score.

In the second quarter, the West Vir-
ginia-team managed to score its lone
touchdown when Hare intercepted a
Pitt pass at midﬁeld, returning it to
the Pitt 17-yard line. From that point
he faded back and shot a short bullet
pass to Smith, who raced over the
Panthers’ goal standing up. The half
ended, 12-6, ‘in favor of the Pitt “B”
team.

Turning on the power again in the
third quarter, the Pitt junior varsity
scored in four plays after the half be-
gan, Dougert took the kickoff back
to the Pitt 49-yard line, and then add-
ed 30 more, putting the ball on the
West Virginia 21-yard line. From. this
point, Iafolla went to the 3 and Ruff
hit the center of the line on the next
play for the touchdown.

The ﬁnal touchdown came late in
the last quarter, when lafolla romped
around left end, out toward the side-
line, and ran 76 yards_ He kicked the
extra point, the ﬁrst good one of the
day, making the ﬁnal. count 25-6.

,Coac/2 Carlson Gives Kiddies Break;

Invents Toy ‘Parlor’ Basketball Game

 

If the kid brother callshyou away
from that term paper you are trying
to write up during Christmas vaca-
tion and coaxes you to play a basket-
ball game with him, you can blame
it on Doctor Carlson.

And if you get so involved in the
game that you don’t have the paper
done in time, you can also blame it
on the good doctor for making the
game so interesting.

It all means that Doctor H. Clifford
Carlson, in addition to thinking up
new ways ‘for his varsity basketball
team to win ’em all, has found time
t0_1‘1g up a toy basketball game that
W111 be on the market shortly.

Combining all the thrills, tricks, and
clever plays which are a part, of the
game h1S team exhibits on the hard-
wood ﬂoors, Carlson has developed :1
pastime which can be played on the
d1111118‘ _ 1‘oom table by men, women,
and children,

The 8‘?-me -has as "its basis "sixty
plays that develop in a. regular basket-
ball game. No science is involved in
the playing, V

A miniature basketball is given a

ispin and it certain play appears at a
, window on the board_ For those who
lcannot read (smaller children) a star
indicates that the ball has changed
,hands. When a score is made, the

1 Scores are recorded on a miniature
lscoreboard and the game is played

,technical fundamentals of the game
iare outlined on the board. for those
who care to_consult them. The boa.rd
is laid out in the form of a regular
basketball court, with all dimensions
marked.

Constructed of a durable metal, the
game is sturdy enough to withstand
the shocks of a.nybody’s kid brother

and the bright, colors it displays

Undefeated Navy

Offense Wide-Open As Nicksick
Scores Four Times In 25-6
Victory Over Huskers

 

\Vith the uncertainty that always
has accompanied a Pitt game at Ne-
braska sately put out of the way, the
attention of all those who believe that
Pitt is the class of the East, at least,
will shift down to Annapolis. Sat.u_r-
day where the Pitts will make their
last play in the spotlight by sailing
into the undefeated and untied men
of the Navy.

The Panther power, which has in-
creased in volume for two successive
Saturdays, will be thrown against a
Middie eleven that has coasted along
on a light rolling sea and the result
will perhaps settle the minds of those
who still pick Eastern champions.

Seven victories, in all, have been
run up on the mast for the Navy, with
a 10-6 triumph over the lrisli of Notre
Dame ﬂoating now from the top posi-
tion. Columbia’s colors fl)’ _t11'31'9:
after surrendering to the midshipmell,
18-7, and Maryland's ﬂag 3-150 deco‘
rates the sailor's mast after Navy
sneaked out a close one, 16-13, in that
battle.

The Navy guns were much too
powerful for the other small fleets
which came into range, swamping
William and Mary, Virginia. and Penn
without wasting any b1"0adS1d€S-

Navy had some small difficulty in
setting down Notre Dame Saturday-
The ﬁgures reveal, in fact, that the.
Irish outplayed the Middies, rolling
up 14 ﬁrst downs to three, The Pay‘
off still comes in points -scored, h0W-
ever, and the Navy seems able ‘-0 get
into port quite often.

One point which attracted the at-
tention of those who witnessed the
game was the comparative ease with
which the Irish backs turned the
Navy ends. If there is such a weak-
ness prevailing Saturday, it won’t take
long for Dr, Sutheriand’s Panthers to
go places.

captain “Buzz” Borries still appears
to be the Inainsp-ring of the Middie
attack, Saturday after‘ Saturday, and
the success with which the Pitt
tacklers will be able to \v1_‘aD_t11e11"
arms around the legs of his impel‘-
sonator, Art Ruff, in the practice ses-
sions this week may give a hint of
how far the Navy attack will go Sat-
urday.

The boys from Annapolis are an-
other one of those teams who have a
habit of tossing the football around as
though it were a basketball. Their
use of lateral passes and forward
passes has brought no end of ‘worry
to opposing elevens and the Pitt de-
fense works will have to be operating
with eyes wide Open '60 Put 3 Si‘-OD ‘-0
that.

Huskers Get 1Husked

Left halfback Mike Nicksick got a
taste of touchdown blood in the Notre
Dame game a week ago when he
counted two against the Irish. A
trip west seems to have improved his
health because the boy was able to
carry it over four times at Nebraska
Saturday.

Mike's four six—pointe-rs were.just
about all the scoring the Pitts did in
their 25-6 victory over the Cornhusk-
ers. The game was one that had the
fans popping right out of their seats
when the visitors began to toss later-
als at any point and throw fear as of.
a drought into the hearts of the West-
erners.

In taking that ball game, the Pan-
thers not only enhanced their chances
for national recognition» but they
spoiled a perfectly good home record
which the Huskers have owned since
a defeat by Kansas State in 1930. But
Pitt wasn’t having any sentimental-
ites about that ball game.

'Weinstock also played a great ball
game for the Panthers, clearing the
way for Nicksick’s runs on most occa-
sions. W'einstock’s use of the lateral
pass had the Nebraskans bewildered
and it is likely that all that the boys
will be dreaming about for a while. is
seeing Mike Nicksick breathing
heavily in the end zone after success-
ful touchdown runs. Pitt’s line was
working smoothly and had the Ne-
braska forwards at its mercy all aft-
ernoon.

When the jig was about up and
Sutherland had removed most of his
first-string men, Nebraska put ore!‘
its only score, After throwing a series
of passes, the Huskers completed one
to Ray Toman, a sub end, who caught
the ball near the goal line and stuiub-
led over for the six points.

Pitt scored in every period but the
last and then they didn't need it.
Whether or not it was because the
town of Lincoln is so far from here
that led Sutherland to let his boys
open up, or whether it was just a nice
chance to practice ﬁghting the Navy
with her own game, no one can tell.
At any rate, Pitt surely opened up.

The scoring was done by Nicksick
and the blocking was done by Wein-
stock. Izzy would also break through
out into the open and, when about to
be dropped by the secondary, would
toss the ball back to Nicksick and
Mr. Nicksick knew just what to do
with it from that point on.

Lloyd Cardwell played best for the
Nebraskans and gives off every indi-
cation that he is the boy they have
been looking for out there ever since

George Sauer walked off with his
sheepskin.

Greeks Get Going In Touch Football Tourney Games

Greek meets Greek! With Groscope
setting the pace, the Phi Delts won a
smashing 18-6 victory over Green’s
Pi Lams Thursday at the Trees ﬁeld
to enter the second round of the In-
terfraternity touch football tourney.
On Friday at 4:30, exactly one day
later, Pi Kappa Alpha followed with a
clear cut 19-0 victory over the Phi
Eps.

With only these two games played,
the Phi Delts look like the class of the
upper bracket in the league. It took
Groscope just five minutes to shake
Saxnian off for the first touchdown
with a long 4I0Lyard pass straight down
the center of the ﬁeld, Elirman, Pi
Lambda Phi, blocked the place kick
for the extra point.

In the second quarter Green tied
the score for Pi Lams with a 35-yard
pass to Goldberg who was close to
the end zone. Green’s pass to Spitz
for the extra point was incomplete

in

 

and at the half the score was still
knotted at [-6. The Pi Lams, how-
ever, led in ﬁrst down, 2 to 1,

In the third period the Phi Delts
started to click. Kocliman made a
ﬁne slioestring catch of Gr0scope’s
sensational 50-yard pass to the two-
yard line stumbling the remaining dis-
tance for six more points and victory.
From this point on, the Phi Delts had
everything their way. Groscope put
on the ﬁnishing touches with a tricky
30-yard run in the dying moments of
the game.

Darkness made passing difficult in
the ﬁnal period and completions were
at a premium. Short runs by Green
and Spitz for Pi Lambda Phi failed to
 the required nioinentum to score
as Timer Siedle blew the ﬁnal whistle.

Compared to this ﬁrst game, the
Phi Ep-Pi K A game was a slightly
tame affair. Teats featui'ed'for the
winners with spectacular runs and
fine kicking. His long, high punts
kept the Phi Eps bottled up through

most of the play, Engel scored ﬁrst
for Pi Kappa Alpha on a long pass
from P. Vvhitaker. Teats kicked the
extra point,

Shortly after this, Traesch scored a
safety on a blocked punt, In the
third period, George and Davis scored
four more points to boost the Pi K A
score to 13 points. George caught
a Phi Ep back behind the goal line
t'or the ﬁrst safety in this period and
Davis accounted for the second on
a blocked punt. Corbett ended the
scoring for the afternoon with a nice
20-yard run behind perfect interfer-
ence. The Pi K A's defensive game
was outstanding. The Phi Ep’s just
couldn't get started.

This touch football championship
tournament is sponsored by Interfra-
teriiity council, aided by the Athletic
department. George Golanty
Robert La Rue are co-chairman of In-
terfraternity athletics. A ﬁrst place
trophy and a cup‘ for the ruiiner-up

will go to the two ﬁnalists.

Notes On Nebraska
Good trainsmen Al M. Becker, of the Penn-

ton, again showed how to handle three cars
of footballers. coaches, trainers, and student
managers. Best headwork was not in railroad-
ing at all but in getting Pitt team out of
Cornhusker hotel in Lincoln by freight eleva-
tor to busses parked in an alley. The boys
were dressing at the stadium before the thou-
sands of persons crowding the hotel for a
look at them knew they were gone. Grad-
uate Manager Jim Hagen, Becker and Mc-
Adoo make a team that knows all the an-
swers about long distance traveling.
