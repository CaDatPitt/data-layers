—— In Brief

Pitt graduate runs for Congress

, Harris Miller, a 1972 Pitt CAS summa cum laude graduate,
Phi‘Beta Kappa “Senior Man ofthe Year”award recipient and
Pitt News writer recently announced his candidacy for the US.
Congress from the 10th District of Virginia.

In I972, while still an undergraduate at Pitt, Miller was ‘  r R if V ~ A
elected as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. 0 ‘  V —  i V .

suburbs. If Miller gains the Democratic nomination, he will
face Congressman Frank Wolf, a Republican from Virginia, in
the Nov. 6 generalelection. Miller recently won a straw poll,
and his candidacy has met with favorable response.

Miller, 32. was born in New Kensington, Pa.

Brighter outlook for graduates

The annual Changing Times survey for new college igradu- V A   ’
ates found some encouraging signs forjob seekers in what has _  
been considered to be a dim recruiting year. _ R

The survey, which seeks responses from employers planning R
to hire graduates this spring, reported that more than 100
companies and government agencies have definite job open-
ings. These employers will be listed in the next issue of Chang-
ing Times in a special supplement entitled “l0l Companies
with Jobs for College Grads."

Former Panther Welch passes
away ‘

The Pittsburgh athletic community is mourning the death ofGilbert
Gibby" Welch who died Friday. Welch, 77, was a running back forthe
Panthers from 1925-27. To this day he is ranks third on Pitt‘s all-time
list for multi-purpose yards (behind Tony Dorsett and Dan Marino).
He accounted for 4,108 yards in only 28 games (for a per game average
of 146 yards).

Spirit win pair

Th.e Spirit scored back—to—back one-goal victories this weekend. On
Friday, Paul Child tapped in a Steve Buttle pass from the doorstep
just 24 seconds into overtime to lead the Spirit to a 6-5 win over the
first place Cleveland Force. Sunday, Dave Hoggan registered the
game—winner with only l:05 left in regulation time as the Spirit edged
the LosAngeles Lazers 3-2. The pair ofwins, coupled with a Cleveland
split, moved the local side to within one—and-a—half games of first in‘

Is A Valentine Gift

the Major lndoor Soccer Leagues Eastern Division.

By Mary ‘Daigle
The Pitt News

Circumstances beyond his teams’s

control is what Lady Panther swim~

coach David Belowich attributes to
the team’s 72-68 loss to Princeton on
Saturday.

“One thing led to another,“ Belo-
wich said. “It started with the cars at
the airport. We had to cram 23 peo-

" ple into three six-passenger cars. We

couldn’t find a restaurant in
Newark, so we ate along the turn-
pike. Then, the people at the re'nt-a-
car dealer gave us the wrong
directions.”

Two and a half hours later, 10
minutes prior to the starting of the
meet, the team pulled into the park-
ing lot at Princeton —— far from
ample time to warm up.

“We were at the mercy of the ele-
ments,” Belowich said. “Our routine
was thrown off.”

Despite the adverse conditions the
Lady Panthers managed to start off
strong taking the first event, the 200-
yard medley relay.

  Princeton edges swimmers  

Princeton took first and second in
the next two events. But Pitt came
back and took first place in the next
four events including the 500-yard
freestyle in which Susan Hickman’
set a pool record.

The one-meter diving competition
was close but Princeton’s Beth
Bridgewater took first place. Tricia
Ney and Tricia Schultz came in
second and third for Pitt.

‘Jane Broderick, who took herself
out of the one-meter competition for

Princton, came back to take first Q

place in the three-meter event.

The 200-yard individual medley is
what lost the meet for Pitt. Lynda
Kerr came in first to give Princeton
72-6| advantage. The Lady Pan-
thers won the last event of the meet
to make the final score 72-68.

“I don’t know how many teams
could do what we did,” said Belo-
wich. “We showed a lot of fight."

Belowich hopes that the loss will
serve as an incentive for the Big East
Championship which starts this

2 Thursday. — r

“If anyone was getting over confi-
dent," he said “the loss should put
things into perspective."

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

Once again, displaying a flair for
the dramatic and a penchant for
near-perfection, the Pitt women’s
basketball team (14-9) roughed up
St. John's Saturday night at Fitzger-
ald Field House, 83-64, to maintain
a grip on first place in the Big East.

The streaking Express was
stopped cold by Pitt's unimaginative
but effective offense and inter-
changeable defenses.

“Every time they called a time-
out, we changed our defense,” said
Lady Panther coach Judy Saurer.
“We weren‘t real creative on offense,
but it worked, so why change it.”

St. John’s ( 19-3, 4-2 in the confer-
ence) lost the top spot in the Big East
and will likely lose their No. 18
national ranking, as well.

u “We’l1 be out of the top twenty,"
St. John's coach Don Perrelli said,
gjwhich will bring us back to reality."
’ Pertelli, whose team had only lost to
Georgia and Providence, pins the

blame on poor shooting. Barbara ,

Rapp led St. John’s with 22 points.

“Basically, it was our inability to
put the ball in the basket in the
second half,” Perrelli remarked.
Proving his case, his team shot a
paltry 28.6 percent from the field in
the second half.

Pitt, which has won four of the
last five, healed quickly from a with-
ering defeat at Penn State three days
previous to the meeting with St.
John’s. 1

“After that loss, we really under-
stood the meaning of the Big East,”
said Lisa Fubio, whose defense
speaks more than the 12 points and
11 assists she handed out.

“Defense is my game,” Fubio said.
“We each play a different game, and
we understand our roles.”

The Lady Panthers overcame a
scoring drought late in the first half

after building a nine-point~ lead.
Stephanie Collins‘ 18-foot jump
shot put Pitt ahead, 35-26 at 4:56
mark, but that cushion was quickly
deﬂated. _

A series of missed layups and bad
passes enabled St. John's to out-
score the host, 13-2, and take a slim
39-37 lead into the locker room. “We
shifted personnel and there was a
mental lapse with us guards,” Fubio
explained.

Saurer accepted responsibility for

the lapse. ‘‘I’d rather go for the lay- 0

up, so I kept punching it inside,” she
said. “Also, sometimes 1 like to get
-[Kim] Tirik out to give her a rest.”

Tirik leads the conference in
assists (I49) and handed out seven
against the Express, as well as scor-
ing 12. Her ballhandling ability is
complemented by a team-leading 80
percent free throw mark. The 5-8
guard was a perfect four-for-four on
the foul line and made four of five
from the field.

The team connected on 21 of 24
free throws, including 16-for—l8 as
part of the second-half resurgence.
The

Lady Panthers

continued from page sixteen
Dabkowski said that Shirk’s 9.6
on the bars gave the whole team a
lift. She commented that they are
really working together.

“We were trying to get a really .

good team score; that's what we‘
were really concentrating on. We
have a lot of improving we can do;
we really want to get past- our 178
andgbreak 180.”

Pitt fielded a lineup Friday that
was slightly different from the their

usual routine. Aside from the substi- '

tution of Sara Strickland for Debbie
Dabkowski in the floor exercise, six

Lady Panthers also vastly.

  Lady Panthers top St. John’s,83-64

after the break, climbing from 16- —

for-40 to a respectable 15-for-24.

Pitt had four players in double-
ﬁgures. Jennifer Bruce led all scores
with 23 points and 10 rebounds and
Julie Callan added 18 points and 10
rebounds. Tirik and Ellen Gilhooley
each contributed 12 points.

Gilhooley‘s nine assists reflect
Pitt’s offensive objective. “We knew
we had to play as a team,” Gilhooley
explained. “Most often 1 look to get
the ball inside because it’s easier to
score.” —

Bruce attributed Pitt’s second-
half comeback to her team’s
improvement in working the ball
around, catching the Express off-
guard.

“We started out slow and they
hung with us, then they broke down
on defense," she said. “We moved
the ball quickly and they'couldn't
react." -4.

The 6-0 forward was not surprised.
by the score, however. “They‘re
over-ranked. We thought they’d give
us more of a run for it.”

The Lady Panthers have a break
until Saturday, when they travel to
New York to take on Syracuse.

rout Clarion

gymnasts (Babbie Flock, Karen
Martin, Lisa Shirk, Alisa Spector,
Kristy Pieters and Dabkowski) com-
peted in all four events. Martin said
that this lineup gave some gymnasts
a chance to recover from injuries
that have hit the team.

“It's very possible that we could
we could score 180 next _ week
against Penn State; if we hit, we can
do anything,” Alisa Spector said. “I
made a handspring-front-vault this
week, and it’s the first time this year.
I was a little scared about that. We
missed it every meet so far this year,
but I made it this week. lt was a real
accomplishment for me.”

MORGANTOWN —« The Har-
dee’s Classic this past Friday (Feb.
10) at the University of West Virgi-
nia proved to be rewarding for the
Pitt Lady Panther Track team.

“They did very good," said coach
Elbert Kennedy who stresses the
importance of “improvement” with
each meet. As quoted in the Feb. 10

article, “quality is moving up as we r
h in

run eac eet,“ he adds, “we run to
win, but our goal is to improve,”and
that they did.

Three of the girls ran personal
best times. Freshman Edith Butler
won the 400-meter dash in a time of
56.46. .Distance—runner Amy
DiFrancesco placed third in the
3000-meter run while crossing the
finish line in a personal time of
10:36.2. Sophomore sprinter Sue
Torre failed to place in the to ix
but recorded a 26. l 5 in the 200 er
dash. ‘

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

A Other Lady Panther finishers
were Felicia Blake, second place in
the 800-meter run with a time of
(2:l5.67), and Gail Counts with a
third place finish (7.24) in the 55-
meter dash, and a second place
(25.24) in the 200-meter dash.

The relay (4 x 400) team of Blake,
Torre, Counts, and Butler won an
easy first place with a time of
(3:55.89), as they left Kent State
(4:03.84) and third place West Virgi-
nia University (4:05.95) in the dust.

Junior 'nter Renee Henderson
was out d e 0 possible tissue dam-
age which will later be diagnosed by
a physician‘. ’

This weekend is the biggie. The
Big East Championship at Syracuse,
New York. It’s also the end of the
Indoor season for the Lady Pan-
thers. Coach Kennedy ho that
the transition from indoor out-
door will be easy. “The girls are run-
ning more confident now,” said
Kennedy, “it’s going to take awhile
for the transition, but they’ll
improve."

said. “And we held them to 25 points
the second half.

“But we couldn’t put the ball in" I
the basket.”

The same was true for Pitt,as the
Panthers only shot 34.5 percent(20
for 58) from the floor. But Villano-
va’s field goal percentage was s-
ual. When Massimino took hi st
glance at the statistics sheet in the
locker room, the paper fell out of his
hand, his face show‘ disbelief as
the stats showed the ildcats shot
40.4 percent from the floor.

The defensive switch put motiva-
tion and movement into Pitt.

“In a zone, you sometimes stand
still on defense,” said Vaughan, who
shot only three for 18 but shared
game—high honors with Pressley
with 12 rebounds. “In man, we got»
everyone in motion.”

Taking up theslack in Vaughan’s
place offensively was junior forward
Andre Williams, who took game
honors with 16 points on eight for I3 ,
shooting from the floor. McLain led
Villanova with 14 points.

The Panthers are now on a mod-
est two game winning streak going
into a non~conference match at.

Also, the vict broke a three-game

Defense leads Panthers

over Villanova, 47 45

By Scott Dellett

The Pitt News

It was fitting that the Pitt-
Villanova game was decided on two
defensive plays. .

Saturday night's clash at the Fitz-
gerald Field House did not _show
excellent long range shooting or
high-flying skyshow acts. Instead,
the contest was one based on gritty,
hard nosed defense of which Bobby

V Knight would have been proud.

George Allen made the most
memorable play of the night, grab-
bing a loose ball at the Wildcat end
of the court with just seconds
remaining,-driving to the basket and

" putting up a soft, underhand shot

towards the glass. =

There was just one problem —— the
ball never reached its destination.
The towering hand of 6-10 center Ed
Pinckney spiked the ball into the end
zone seats.

Never mind that a foul was called
on Gary McLain, the sellout crowd
wanted to know if the ball reached
its zenith when Pinckney did his vol-
leyball -imitation. There were
approximately 6,600 pairs of eyes
upon one man. I

The official threw down his fist,
signalling the shot good. The Field
House crowd went wild, and Pitt
squeaked out a 47-45 victory.

“I don't think you call goaltending
in that close of a game," Villanova
coach Rollie Massimino said.

‘‘There‘s no question in my mind,
Panther coach Roy Chipman said.
“The ball was almost at the top of
the square. Besides, George would
have had two foul shots anyway.

. “It just happened on the last play
of the game.”

Pitt could have avoided some of
the last second heroics. The Panth-
ers took the lead with 4:21 left on a
I5-foot turnaround jumper by Clyde
Vaughan, two of only six points on

L the night for the 6-4 forward. Thirty

seconds later, center Keith Arm-
strong deflected a pass intended for
Pinckney inside to Allen, who drove
down for a layup, increasing the lead
to 45-42.

Lady gymnasts win big

By Wes Cotter
The Pitt News

Gymnastics meets are often
decided by a few tenths of a point, so
the Lady Panthers gymnastics team
broke far from the norm when they
defeated Clarion State University
this weekend by almost 47 points.

When the meet was over the score
board showed a resounding Pitt vic-
tory over the Golden Eagles: 177.40-
130.60. The score was Pitt’s second
highest total of the season.

Breaking records

Sophomore gymnasts Matt Peters and Mark Klaf—
ter set new Pitt records in the Panthers’ win over

Both teams went scoreless for the
next two minutes, as Pitt spread the
offense out. After Pinckney stopped
a dribbling display by guard Curtis
Aiken,,the freshman’s front end ofa
one-and-one bounced off the rim.

On the proceeding trip down-
court, Pinckney, fighting the effects
of the flu, got the rebound off a
McLain miss, put_it in and drew a
foul on Armstrong. The Wildcat
All-America candidate rolled in his
12th point on the foul shot, tying the
game.

On the next Pitt possession,
Vaughan got the ball inside and put
up a I0-footjumper over the hand of
6-7 Harold Pressley. The shot
bounced off and McLain got the
rebound, giving the Wildcats a
chance for the win.

“I wasn’t unhappy about Clyde’s
shot,” Chipman said later. “He’s our
best offensive player; I’ve seen him
hit 15 of those in a row. You have to
have confidence in him.

“You have to be aggressive at
home."

Villanova took two timeouts in
thefinal minute to set up a final shot.
The Wildcats spread out the offense,
hoping to get Pinckney free in the
high post.

Meanwhile, the Panthers coun-
tered with the 1-3-1 half court trap
zone. .

“They were having trouble with
the I-3-I ‘during the night,” Chip-
man said. “If we came out man, they
would have got the ball where they
wanted to."

There were more than a few raised
eyebrows when Pitt came out in a
man-to-man defense instead of their
usual variety of zones.

“VilIanova did very well against
Boston College's I-2-2 and Syra-
cuse’s 2-3,” Chipman explained his
switch, as the Wildcats shot better
than 60 percent in the two Big East
Conference games. “Plus, there is,
the element of surprise, since they
were working against zones in
practice.” _

Villanova also played a variety of
defenses. ‘

“The team played excellent
defense the first half,” Massimino

continued on page thirteen

All-America Lisa Shirk was once
again the leading all-around scorer
of the dual meet. Lisa performed a
near-perfect routine on the uneven
parallel bars and was given a score of
9.6. Debbie Dabkowski also turned
in a good performance on the
uneven parallel bars, scoring a 9.2.

“I did three events, and those were
my“ three highest scores this year,”
Dabkowski said, “and I was really
happy with the bars; ‘I've never
scored ‘a 9.2 on the bars before. I
didn't think I could do it. I never
used to like bars, but I knew I could
hit that routine, so I concentrated."

ame winning shot. A goaltending

call on 'Vi1lanova’s Ed Pinckney gave Pitt a 47-45 win Saturday night.

Armstrong leads Pitt charge

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

Pitt's performance against Villa-
nova Saturday night at the Field
House is certainly one that deserves
admiration. A

This same Panther team that has
been the topic of such controversy
throughout the season has seem-
ingly taken the Super Bowl cham-
pion Los Angeles Raiders’
philosophy to heart.

What happens off the field —_ or in
this case, the court -— should not
have any affect on how the game is
played.

“We have to do that,” centertKeith
Armstrong said. “We have to over-
look these things that happen offthe
court and go out playing the best
that we can. I think we did that
tonight.”

“The things that have happened
over the past week or so have
brought us together even more,”
guard George Allen said. “We don’t
have to rely on the crowd to get us
going anymore. We rely on our-
selves; we’re a real team now.”

From the game's initial moments,
anyone watching who has seen the
Panthers during this 1983-84 season

, should have clearly been able to

notice that this was a team with bul-
lish confidence, unlike the team that

has showed up on game day many of
the times this year.

The often maligned sophomore
center Armstrong went up against
one.of,the premier players in the
country, Ed Pinkney, and played
man-to-man defense that forced the
Villanova offense to look" elsewhere
if they intended on finding a hole to
exploit.

Although Pinkney's statistics
appear rather impressive, I2 points
and nine rebounds, he was definitely
contained by the eager Armstrong.

Armstrong played determinedly.

He may have only scored six
points, but his defensive prowess,
four blocked shots in addition to
many altered Wildcat efforts, put an
intimidation factor into the game
that kept Pitt from ever slipping out.

“Keith told me at the pre-game
meal that he wanted to play man-to-
man on Ed Pinckney," senior point-
guard and team leader Billy
Culbertson said.

“I‘ve always wanted to play with
one of the best,” Armstrong said. “I
knew we had to win this game.
Tonight, I think we all gained a lot of
confidence, not only as a team, but
individually.”

Junior forward, Andre Williams
refused to be taken by the Villanova
team that had come to Fitzgerald
riding an 8-l streak and had beaten
Georgetown, Syracuse and Boston
Collegeduring that streak.

Williams shot eight for I3, good
for I6 points. He grabbed six
rebounds and made two steals while
playing for a team-high 39 minutes.

“I was shooting the ball well,”
Williams said. “But ljust realized
that the team needs me for my offen-

~ sive ability. We played to win and

have fun, and we did both.”

Sophomore Joey David, was
another Panther who gained that
all-important confidence that had
certainly been lacking.

David believed that he could go
one-on-one with either Frank
Dobbs or Dwight .Wilbur, whom-
ever Villanova coach Rollie Massi-
mino had designated, and he was
right. '

“I’ve had some good practices
lately, and I was really looking for-
ward to contribute tonight," David
said. ‘

David finished the evening with
six points on 14 minutes of playing
time. ‘

As for George Allen, there were
no signs of fatigue Saturday night.
Allen played within his capabilities.
He was never afraid to penetrate on
the offensive side and played excel-
lent defense.

“We have to keep this game as an 5

upbeat," Allen said. “We have to
play for ourselves and not worry
about what people are saying about
