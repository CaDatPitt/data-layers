Pitt Professor Seeks to

By COLLEEN McDONALD

Pitt News Staff Writer
Another attempt was made last

week by John Chapman, Political

Science professor and member of I

the International ‘Council on V the
Future of" the -University, to
improve “the integrity” of the
University of Pittsburgh.

In a Feb. 24 memo to Chancellor
Wesley Posvar, Chapman insisted
that the administration take im-
mediate corrective action in re-
gards to appointment procedures

and criteria, of university profes-.

sors. ~
“Universities that apply better
criteria are better, ’_’ said Chapman.

“I would like to see Pitt survive.”
Responsibility rests on the
ofﬁcers of the administration, said
Chapman, to maintain Pitt's. '
academic standing. It is up to
them to choose the best qualiﬁed

- candidate and this should be done

through" a “national search”
procedure, said Chapman.
The appointive processes must’

~ be made more stringent. “Assess-

ments of competing ‘candidates
should be presented in indepen-
dently written statements as well
as orally,” said Chapman.

“Criteria ‘to be applied are

-originality,‘ rigor, and fundamental '

At the universities of Harvard,
Princeton and Columbia the matter
of appointment is taken seriously,
according to Chapman. Fullproof
procedures are enforced to insure
the selection of a highly qualified

.faculty.

Stanford rates among the highest
in establishing the best criteria for
faculty appointments, said Chap-
man. ,

“They have a search committee

The Pitt Hotline could become
extinct by October of the fall term,
unless Hotline coordinator Michelle
Rzucidlo can recruit enough new
members for her staff to run the
student service properly and more
effectively. '

“We’re severely understaffed
and would have problems if we
became swamped with calls,” said
Rzucidlo. “For the last five years,
staff interest in helping the general

0' student population has ~been

dying.’ ’

students, is capable of working with
crisis intervention situations, peer-
to-peer counseling, information
referral and direct referral.

“We plan. to improve the infor-
mation referral soon. If students
call and need information on bill‘
processing, for example, we should
be able to tell them where they can
call.‘ As far as the direct referral
goes, what we try to do there is get

' students in contact with profes-

sional counselors if it appears they

need help from professionals at

either the University Counseling
Center, "which is on campus, or the
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic,” she said. ’

“The Hotline was startedlaack in '

the late'60S. andewas run- by profes-.

University. It had some student
volunteers, and primarily received
phone calls from students concern-

ing drug experimentation. Ten

years ago, more students called to
ﬁnd out from ‘Little Help’ (the
Hotline’s former name) what‘ they
had taken and what the effects were
going to be,” she said.

“When students stopped calling
in with _drug problems, or other
serious problems, the professionals
moved elsewhere and the students

were left to keep the. Hotline aﬂoat. "

' What sophomores Marisett Van

to do’ was let the Hotline die by

simply not submitting a budget re-

quest for next year, according to

Rzucidlo. Three weeks ago, when-

Van Linden and Bunner left "the
Hotline, Rzucidlo took the position
of coordinator and tried to compile
and submit a full budget request to

“It is imperative that we

Chapman also noted that the
university should require that

’who have been inbred ‘into the

with external candidates.

‘ ‘Driving ambition, ’ ’ Chapman
concluded, “for both the depart-
ments and the University is

SGB Develops Draft
Registration Survey

— By HELEN M. GIANELLA.
Pitt News Staff Writer

‘ Almost one month ago, the Stu-
dent Government Board, sponsored
an open forum on the reinstitution
of the draft, in the Student Union
lower lounge. The students at large
were given the chance to express
their views on issues such as draft
registration, the current interna-
tional situation and the possible
threat of war.

The information and results of
the forum were to serve as a guide
to the SGB which would enable
them‘ to arrive at a “consensus”
and resolution that would be for-
wardedto President Carter.

Since the views of the students
were so evenly divided, the board
was unable to reach a decision.

According to board member Joe
Blazer, the forum, though well at-
tended, did not give an accurate
description of how the student body
felt as a whole. '

“We didn’t think it gave us a

- good cross section of the students,”

said Blazer. ‘ '

Bill Abraham, SGB president
said, “There appeared to be -a
balanced sentiment that day. The
majority of us (the board) felt it
wasn’t indicative of what the
students wanted.’ ’

In an effort to come up with a
more accurate description of the
student’s view on the draft, the
SGB ‘is presently working on a

   
  

survey to be distributed to many
areas of the campus.

Blazer, one of the authors of the
survey, said it deals with such issues
as women in the draft, draft eva-
sion and voluntary sign up.

“We are going to the different
departments on campus to reach as
many students as possible,” said
Blazer.

The board had originally hoped
to reach at least 500 students but,

according to Blazer, have gotten to

well over 750.

Once the surveys are in and the
results are tabulated, the board will
again attempt to reach a decision
and draw up a proposal to be sent
ot the president and his staff.

Abraham explained that if the
views are again evenly divided, the
statistics from the survey would be
forwarded to Carter as is.

“He would be left to make his
own conclusion,” Abraham said.
“If there is a strong leaning in one
direction or another,” he said, “we
will attach our own statement to the
results.”

Abraham feels that the president
will acknowledge the Pitt draft
survey, but believes that Carter is
trying hard to push the registration
of the draft through.

“He’s interested in us,” con-
tended Abraham. “But he has
sincere belief in which he is doing is
right.”

A U.N. commission investigating

'- The Pennsylvania Daily Number,

i now three years old and ﬂourishing

beyond anyone’s wildest dreams,
owns the most precise and

' pampered set of ping pong balls in

‘ ' Their care is part of the State‘

the state.

Lottery Commission’s elaborate
security network, involving
sophisticated computers and fool
proof checks, that protects the in-
tegrity of a billion dollar business.
“Security is our number one con-

cern,” said Lynn Nelson, the lot-

tery’s executive director. “Each
player has to know that he or she
has just as much chance of winning
as the next person.”

And Revenue Secretary Howard
Cohen, whose department oversees
all lottery operations, points out
that a constant vigil is kept to guard
against cheating.

“Security an_d integrity are the

cornerstones of confidence. People .

have to believe the game is honest.
If people don’t have confidence in
the lottery, they won’t play it,”
Cohen said in a recent interview.
The ping pong balls, which cost

$70 apiece, produce the winning

three-digit Daily Number drawn at
7 p.m. Monday through Saturday
on a six-station live television net-
work.

The lottery has four sets of 10
balls, ‘always keeping one set in
reserve and to assure a random

pick. Each is individually painted to .

exact specifications and then var-
nished to keep the paint from chip-
pins» . A

Each month, the Burrell Corp.,
an outside testing laboratory that
distributes scientific equipment,

. weighs each ball in a set to insure
that no ball is heavier or lighter

within a 5 percent variance of the
average weight.
A ball usually is used two to four

. months before it is replaced.

To insure that no one person has
access to them, the balls are kept in-
side metal boxes inside a double
locked vault at WTAE-TV, the pro-
ducing station in Pittsburgh.

One key is kept by the program
producer, the other by a lottery
security officer.

Each night, three sets are chosen
at random to be used for the draw-
ing. Likewise, three of four bingo
machines are selected. No one ever
knows what balls will be in what
machine or in what order.

Meanwhile, a sophisiticated com-
puter with 1,000 outlets around the
state takes bets, ranging from 50
cents to $5. It automatically shuts
before the
number is drawn, and vendors can
begin paying off three minutes after
the winning number is ﬂashed.

With a touch of a button, lottery
headquarters in Harrisburg can see
what number is being bet the
heaviest, who’s selling the most

tickets and what -the maximum
payoff will be.

“We have control" of the game
every second of the day,” Nelson
said’.

If the number matches the exact
sequence picked by a bettor, the
payoff is 500 to 1. The odds of that
happening are 1,0()0 to 1—with the
state pocketing the difference" to
finance programs for senior
citizens.

The game is a replica of an age
old gambit that reaped huge,‘illegal
rewards for the rackets. The illegal
game, known as the “poor man’s
stock market,” soared in popularity
during the Great Depression.

Pennsylvania got into the action
on March! 1, 1977. First week sales
were $1.8 million Now, sales
routinely top $1 million a day.

England’s King James I financed
the founding of the Jamestown col-
ony. George Washington and
Thomas Jefferson "ran games.

And Ben Franklin used a lottery
to found what is now the University
of Pennsylvania.

But private companies ruined the
games. The Louisiance Company,

one of the lottery firms, began rigg- ’

ing its rafﬂes. And Congress
banished them in the 1890’s.

“We’re in a business competing‘

for the discretionary dollar of the
adult buying public,” said Nelson,
explaining the lottery’s role.

“We are not a tax. People only
play the lottery because they want
ltis a form of entertainment.
We are not a panacea to cure the
fiscal woes of the state,” he added.

‘_ ‘We have been an excellent
source of income for much needed
programs.”

P|ayboyB‘unny Under Investigation; Promotio

SAN DIEGO—Lisa Ann Woolf,
in hot water with the Navy for pos-

3‘-‘-.‘lng nude in Playboy magazine,

prefers to think of herself as “a
good sailor” who spruced up the
swabby’s image.
“Before I joined up I thought all
women sailors were big, ugly and
, had hair on their chests,” said the
5-foot-2, 110-pound Miss Woolf, a
machinist aboard the San Diego-
based Samuel Gompers, a destroyer’
tender.

"Maybe this Will 5h0W‘the men 22, out of the Marine Corps on an
that there are some pretty women in early discharge_

the Navy,” said Miss Woolf, who
last year was among the first women
stationed aboard a Navy ship.

Because she and a friend, Susan
Gage, are among six military
women featured in next month’s
Playboy, the Navy has launched an
investigation that could cost then?
their jobs.

The -controversy erupted last
week, forcing Bambi Lynn Finney,

A total of six women representing
the Navy, Army, Air Force and
Coast Goard appear in Playboy’s
April edition. V

The fate of Miss Woolf and Miss
Gage, a 22-year-old interior
communications technician, will be
determined by their respective
commanding officers, a Navy
spokesman said.

Both are scheduled to be pro-

moted, but, because of the investi--
gation, Miss Woolf said she has
been advised that her promotion

has been held up.

“They have to decide whether it’s
degrading to the service,” she said.

She accepted the magazine’s of-
fer to be in the pictorial layout after
answering a newspaper ad.

§on A Suspect In Murder Case Of People ’s Temple Defectoijs

By The Associated Press

BERKELEY,Calif.—Investi-
gators said Thursday they had con-
ducted tests on the son of the two
slain defectors from the People’s
Temple to see if he had recently
fired a gun. They also said suicide,
robbery and a crimeiof passion had
been ruled out in the case.
' According tosources close to the
investigation, officers were awaiting
the results of sophisticated tests
ordered Wednesday on Eddie Mills,

17. The tests were aimed at deter-
mining whether he had recently
used a firearm or was “stoned” on
drugs duringthe shootings Tuesday
night of parents, Al Mills, 51, and
Jeannie Mills 40.

In official announcements, police"
would say only that the youth had
been interviewed and released.

The Mills’ daughter, Daphene,
16, was shot twice in the head dur-
ing the attack. She clung to life, her

brain-waves “flat,” with the help

of support machines at Alta.Bates
Hospital. Sources said that if fur-
ther brain scans Thursday remained
ﬂat, she would be declared legally
dead and life-support equipment
disconnected. Hospital authorities
were trying to get -permission to use
her kidneys for a transplant.
Meanwhile, investigators for the
Alameda County District
Attorney’s Ofﬁce said evidence
gathered to date ruled out suicide
and also eliminated robbery or a

crime of passion as motives for the
shootings.

The Mills’ were among the first
sharp critics of the Rev. Jim Jones’

' cult, which was swept away Nov.

18, 1978, in an orgy of more than
900 murders and suicides at
.Jonestown, Guyana. The couple
convinced they were on acult “hit
list” prepared before the mass
deaths, had joined a movement to
help those fleeing the Temple
rebuild their lives.

The Alameda county coroner’s
office said autopsies showed that
the Millses both died of a small-
caliber gunshot wound

fragmented. Sources said ballistics
experts were trying to ‘reassemble
the fragments to establish caliber.
The death cottage «showed “no
signs of a struggle, no signs of rob-
bery or burglary," and no weapon
was found, and we don’t have a
motive,” investigators said. _

 trich Real
Traffic Stopper

BELLEVUE, Wash.-—Oscar the
ostrich is a real trafﬁc stopper.

Trooper Harvey Hawkens found
that out Tuesday when he, came
upon a traffic jam on Interstate 90
in this suburb east of Seattle.

A motorist told him an ostrich
was impeding traffic.

‘‘I figured‘ it was probably an owl
or - something,” said Hawkens.
“But thne I saw a neck sticking out
from the cars. Sure enough, it was
an ostrich. The thing had to be five
feet tall,”

Its owner‘, Roger Kildall, soon‘ ar-

rived to capture his pet, named .

Oscar, one of the three Rhea
ostriches about eight months old he

-keeps in his back yard.

Street Name
Kills Business

MUSKEGON, Mich.—-A cemetery
owner wants the city to change the
name of the street that runs in front
of his graveyard. He says it’s bad
for business when a cemetery is
located on Industrial Boulevard.
Paul Buterakos, president of
Sunrise Memorial Gardens, has

,/

asked city ‘officials to change the
name of the street to “Remem-

brance Boulevard” or “Remem-

brance Drive. ’ ’ ,
“Industrial Boulevard just
nauseate me . for a cemetery,”
-Buterakos said. “We were here
ﬁrst, you know.” ~
The 65-acre cemetery was
developed in 1952, but growth at a
nearby industrial park didn’t start
until the mid 1960s, Buterakos said.
City officials referred the request
to the planning commission, but it’s
notlikely they'll agree to a change.
In 1970, Buterakos’ request to
rename the street

Boulevard” was denied after op-
position by businesses in the in-
dustrial park.

Not A Swinger
Despite Magazine

BRANDON, S.D.—A 25-year-

old woman would like the world to
know she is no swinger, despite
what an ad says in‘ a magazine.

The woman and her husband -
just call them Bob and Susan - have
no idea how the ad got into “Sw-
inger’s Hotline,” a magazine
published in Memphis, Tenn. But
they want it out.

The couple, who live in Brandon,
S.D., have requested an unlisted
phone number to stop the calls
from lusty men. ‘ '

“I am associated with Swinger’s
Hotline right here in the Sioux Falls
area and I was wondering if we
could get together this afternoon,”
one man asked Tuesday. It was the
third such call Susan had received
since last November. 4 t

The magazine will not cancel the I

ad, despite the couple’s protests.

And the couple has no‘ legal
recourse unless a rejected caller
makes a threat, Bob said.

“Our hands are tied,” Bob said.
“There’s been no threat, no harm
done.‘ These guys call in good
faith.”

“We’re totally blown away,”

Bob said. “If the magazine sells her \.

name it can get worse and worse. It
could go on forever.” ‘

Things are looking up for the people who live and
work in Oakland. A three-year, $100,000 study deal-
ing with the problems of the Oakland community will
be released shortly by the Clean-up Oakland Cam-
paign to be used in making community im-
provements. A

Since Pitt’s expansion during the late 1960s and
early 1970s, the make-up of the1Oakland. area has
changed. Businesses, once catering to sporting and
cultural crowds (during the heyday of the Syria Mos-
que and Forbes Field) have changed to include many

fast food chains and bars. Also, the residential areas.
, now house a much larger number of students rather ’
. than long-time residents. .

The changes brought overpriced and overcrowded
housing, absentee landlords, streets strewn with lit-

ter, parking problems and a general _change in the ap- I

pearance of Oakland. _

The Clean-up Campaignis out to change all that-.
The three-year study has provided _the Campaign
with opinions of people who‘; live" and work in

Oakland concerning problems that they encounter:

To Meet Villanova at Arena

 

S_am_mle Ellis goes up for two against Mike Zagardo. Pltl defeated GW in the tournament for the third straight year.

By SAMUEL SCIULLO ,
Pltt News Staff Writer

The Eastern Eight Basketball
Championship Tournament returns
to Pittsburgh's Civic Arena tonight.
Rutgers and West Virginia, both
14-13, meet in the 7 p.m. opener,
while top seeded Villanova (20-7),
plays local favorite Pitt (17-10) in
the 9 p.m. night cap. The winners
will met in the final Saturday night
for an automatic berth
NCAA Tournament, which has a 48
team field this year.

The Panthers will-be trying to
make it two wins in a row over the
Wildcats. Pitt rebounded from a
miserable first half to defeat the
regular season champs at the Field
House", 62-53 nine days ago. In that
game, Sammie Ellis scored 19 of his
23 points in the second half to pace
the Panther attack.

Most observers believe
Wildcats to be the most talented
team in the league, witha muscular
front line and a pair of well season-
ed guards. With“ Alex Bradley,
Eastern Eight Rookie-of-the-Year
John Pinone, and Aaron Howard,
the Cats are a very aggressive,
physical squad.

Pitt Coach Tim Grgurich is look-
ing forward to playing Villanova.

“I loved playing against them,”
Grgurich told the press at a lunch-
eon yesterday. “I know it’s gon-
na be a great game.” -

Villanova is well stocked in the
backcourt with Rory Sparrow, a

' lightning quick playmaker who had» .

perhaps the worst game of his
career against Pitt, and Tom
Sienkiewicz, better known as
the“Polish Riffle,” for his ability
to fill the basket from great
distances.

Vi1lanova’s coach Rollie
Massimino, who defiesall health
principles with his sideline de-
meanor, is anxious to meet the Pan-
thers in the_“City of Champions.”

“Coming to Pittsburgh is very
difficult, but.it’s a challenge,” he
explained. “But it’s really fun to be
here.” .

Mysteriously, with such a
physical team, Villanova is last in

in the —

the .

cond). The Wildcats, according to
Massimino, have been a pleasant
surprise shooting the ball.

“Our shooting has been probably
the primary reason we’ve won 20
games,” he said.

But the main force behind

Villanova is Bradley, a 6-foot-6, 235 5..

pound junior. Two years ago
Bradley was the tournament’s MVP
and scored 35 points in a game
against Pitt. Some experts believed
that Bradley was having a sub par
season, but Massimino thinks his
star player is now right where he
should be. , 

“Right now, Alex Bradley is
playing the best basketball of his
life,”‘said Massimino. “He’s play-
ing like a man possessed because he
knows what he has to do for us to
win.”

Despite a season long problem of
personal fouls, Grgurich shunned

» the notion that the Panthers might

hold back defensively in order to
keep the regulars around for 40
minutes.

“There’s only one way we know
how to play, and that’s hard,” he
said. “And there’s only one way
that\we can play against Villanova,
and that’s to. bang it out with
them.” , ‘

-In the first game, West Virginia’
fresh from a surprising win over
Duquesne, will try to Linseat last
year’s tournament winner Rutgers.
' The Mountaineers should feel
right at home tonight. Their fans
accounted for half of the 5,056 at

the Arena for Tuesday’s Duquesne

game, and West Virginia fans have

. already purchased more than 3,000

tickets for tonight. WVU Coach
Gale Catlett minces no words when
discussing the support generated by
their fans. 2

“West Virginia has the greatest
athletic fans in the.United States,”
said Gale. We’re hoping we’ll have
a real good— turnout Friday night. ’
We played at the-Duquesne game
like it was a home game because of
our fan support. It's an important
part of our success.”

In fact, a majorityof -theWPan-

“thers may feel like they have ' just
’ completed boot camp after the con-
, V clusion of their rocky 3-13-1 regular
V -season. But the Panthers have been

somewhat re-born for this tour-

nament in which all wrestlers are
‘given a clean slate, and we already

know from the U.S. Olympic
Hockey team what odd things can
actually happen in a short t'ourna-
ment. '

The Clarion grapplers, who nab-
bed the EWL championship with a

46-0 league record, seem to be the

squad to watch throughout the
tournament. The Golden Eagles
figure on having a good chance of a
least eight wrestlers winning a berth

most likely be seeded first in the"

118, 126 and 134 pound weight
classes. At 118, Clarion’s Jan Clark
brings into the tournament a perfect
6-0-0 EWL record. To keep that
record perfect he will have to con-
tend with Mike Nock“ of
Bloomsburg State College, j Penn

State's Mike DeAugustino--an All- ’

American in 1978, and Panther
Glenn Maxwell (12-9). Maxwell

_ defeated DeAustino just two weeks _

ago.

“We’re "expecting the most from
Glenn Maxwell and “Smokey”
Smocharski," said Panther assis-
tant head coach Chuck Coryea,
“and we think the suprises will

come from (Jeff) Gordon, (Bill)

Clark and (Mike) Bond.”

The wrestlers Pitt’s Clark will at
tempt to surprise at 126 are
Clarion’s Steve Jastrabeck (15-l,
3-0 in EWL), Dan Foldesy of
Cleveland State and Bloomsburg’s
Don Reese. '

There is no doubt that Panther
Glenn Nacion will have his work cut
out for him at 134 lbs., where two
All-Americans will slug it out.

that coach Coryea feels Panther
Mike Bond could pull off an upset.

“Bond was hurt and he only has
a 1-2 record (in EWL’s),” contends
Coryea, “but you have to
remember he did-beat (Rob). Albert

“Heller has been ' hurt all

IHL Not in Future Of U.S. Olympic Hockey Team

34 American’s

' By The Associated Press

TOLEDO, Ohio—Mike Eru-
zione, the captain of the U.S.
hockey gold medalists, is weighing
several career options—which ap-
parently don’t include returning to
the International Hockey League.

“I can’t see him coming: back to
this league,” said Mike Keating, a
former Eruzione teammate with the
Toledo Goaldiggers. “How could
he ever get up for this and go into a
place like Grand Rapids and play?’’

Eruzione said in the midst of the
stunning Olympic
triumph,‘ “Right now I don’t think
I’ll' be back. I- think I’ll sign a pro-

fessional contract with someone. I

might also go to Europe next year
to play and then I would'be looking
for a place to fin-ish out the season
this year. v

“Returning to Toledo to play
doesn’t look as favorable as it did
before. There is also the possibility
that I might play with the New
England Whalers of the National
Hockey League, but everything‘ is
mostly rumors now. Nothing is
definite.” I

' The'25-year-old Eruzione, second

\ oldest player onthe U.S. Olympic

hockey team, said he would also

In the meantime, he’s been on a
whirlwind tour. It was. the gold
medal-clinching victory over
Finland on Sunday, lunch at the

Eruzione, who played as an
$8,500-a-season amateur in the IHL
for two years before making the
Olympic squad.

“We’ll wait and see what his
agent says,” said Goaldigger
spokesman Harold Shaw.

The fact Eruzione was paid to
play in the IHL and then allowed to
perform in the Olympics as an"
amateur has drawn criticism, but
Frank Gallagher, vice president of
the Amateur Hockey Association 5f

the United States, defends it.

“The IHL is under’ amateur rule
and- we look at whatever the players
are paid as living-expense money,”
said Gallagher, ‘a former commis-
sioner of the league. “As long as
the IHL belongs to AHAUS, the
players are protected that way.
Under Olympic rules, that’s
allowable.” -

Gallagher said at least 15 IHL
players have played for the United
States on Olympic hockey teams.

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer
On the whole your average
freshman at Pitt is a little over 18
years old, wide-eyed, and ready to
take in all the new experiences that
are readily available. The Panther

men's volleyball players are a very
young team this season with a

number of freshmen, but one

stands out unlike any other. That
_man is middle blocker Don Hardin.

Hardin is certainly not your run-
of-the-mill collegiate freshman par-
ticipating in varsity volleyball. In-
stead he is very experienced in both
the playing and coaching aspects of
thegarne.

Hardin considers his past that of
a “gypsy” because of all the
moving he has done. But, the Pan-

‘thers are thankful that he has decid-

ed to ‘settle down for his college
yearsin Pittsburgh.

After graduating from nearby
Plum High School, where he played
very little organized volleyball
because it had yet to become a com-
petitive high school sport, he joined
the United States Air Force.

“I really didn’t learn to much
about the game until I was stationed
in L. A.,” said Hardin. “There I
learned some very good habits from
our player coaches. One person
that taught me a lot was Dave
Albright, who is now on the na-
tional team.

The following years in the Air
Force saw Hardin developing into a
very talented and respected
volleyball player. After three years
in L. A., Hardin was sent to Ger-
many and received more exposure
to top—quality volleyball competi-
tion. In Germany, his team won the
Continental Sports Conference
championship for volleyball. He

was given the honor of being chosen
for the all-star team to play against
a team of European all-stars, where
the German team won for two
straight years.

“I was also invited to‘ the all-Air
Force training camp where they
take the best Air Force players and
give them a month-and-a-half of
training,” said Hardin. “Then we
would compete against teams from
the Army, Navy and Marines. We
won every year.”

Hardin returned to the states
after a year of traveling and made
the decision to enter college. He
looked around at different pro-
grams, and fortunately for the Pan-
thers, he chose Pitt.

“I knew a player from Penn State
and I had been thinking of playing
for them, but I really wasn’t very
interested in their program after
visiting there. I looked at Pitt and

met Coach Mike Hebert who really

impressed me a great deal. He is a.

fantastic coach and I could see that
he could really help me better my
playing skills. He’s the stabilizing
factor behind the program here at
Pitt.”

Hardin’s decision to play at Pitt
was made and he began assisting
Hebert as a student volunteer with
the women's program. As Hardin
is interested in making coaching his
career, he spent time working both
on his playing and coaching techni-
ques, under the guidance of Hebert.

Winning has been a way of life
for Hardin where volleyball is con-
cerned. As a middle blocker, he is
considered by head coach Ray Reil-
ly to be an essential part of the
lineup. b

“Don has added a whole new
dimension to volleyball at Pitt,”
said Reilly. “He is a very ac-

complished player. The experience
he has had is invaluable—he’s an
excellent team leader.’ ’

The Panthers have just returned
from a very grueling, but successful
road trip where they faced three of
the four members in their division.
By beating Penn, Princeton, and
New Jersey Institute, the Panthers
are now 4-0 in the conference, and
it looks as if they will be able to
receive a bid into the Eastern Col-
legiate Volleyball League playoffs
at the end of the year.

’ “We aren’t
anywhere,” said Hardin. “We’ve
been surprising some excellent Divi-
sion I teams like Ohio State and
George Williams in our invitational.
Plus, teams in our conference will
be trying to beat us. If we keep
playing like we are capable of, we
should have a very impressive
season ahead.’_’
