The Third Act Of This
Year’s Rushing Drama
“How Johnny Gets A
New Pin” Begins.

Regular Edition

Fraternity
Rush Time

Continues

Probable Success, Failure
Of Period Made Debate
In Dean’s Office

 

Wlith rushing season beginning its
third day, predicti-on-s as to its prob-
able success or fai-lure are beginning

to roll in from all corners . . . of
the dean of men’s oﬂice.

The wager between N. Robert
Seidle, director of the placement bu-
reau, and Robert Corley, assista-nt
dean of men, has all the appearance
of a heated argument, all in the ﬁg-
ures, of course, with a half pound
tobacco to go to the winner.

Mr. Corley’s prediction was by far
the more optimistic. If he is right,
fraterni-ties will have issued 635 bids
to rushees, the number of individuals
to Whom bids have been extended
will be 425, and the number of new
pledge-s two weeks from last Mon-
day will be 215. These contrast
with Mr. Seidle’s comparative ﬁgures
of 602, 396, and.'198 respectively.

Theodore W1 Biddle, assistant

dean of men in. another corner of
Room 801, Cathedral, is a non-s-mok-
er. For that reason he has not en-
tered in the wager. He ventured,
however, to stack up his predictions
against tho-se of his colleagues, al-
though he took quite a handy beat-
ing from Mr. Sei.d_le‘_at this time last
year. ~ -
And, just as in 1935, his ﬁgures
are comparatively pessimistic. He
says that only 547 bids will be sent
out to 362 individuals, with but 172
men becoming pledges. Last year
the ﬁgures ran: 565, 390, and 172.

The routine program of smokers
and open houses will be replaced
this week, beginning this evening,
with events which should provide
more entertain-men-t for the freshmen.
House dances, parties of various
sorts, theater parties, and excursions
to the city’s most famed entertain-
ment spots provide a full. program
f ': freshmen. .

This elaboration of events has been
made possible by the reduction of
rushing season from ten days to only
six. The open period will ﬁnish at
exactly 2 o’clock Sunday morning.

Swank Exhibits
One-Man Show
At Gulf Rooms
Local Scenes Predominate

Collection Which Lasts
-For Two Weeks

Starting Monday of this week and
continuing for the next two weeks,
Luke Swank, University photograph-
er, will hold a “One Man Show” in
the new galleries on the fourth floor
of the Gulf Building.

F'01'ty of Mr. Swank’s best photo-
graphs of streets, bridges, and in-
dustrial scenes, as well as several
snapshots of the Allegheny Observa-
tory will be on display.

Mr. Swank, who is better known in
Philadelphia, Boston, and New York
than in Pittsburgh, is considered one
of the country’s leadin-g photogra-
phers. He now has on display in
Rockefeller Center, New York, nine
prints. His is one of the largest in-
dividual displays there.

In the national photographers’ pub-
lication, The U. S. Camera, which ac-
cepts only one print a year each
from the world’s best photographers,
has reprinted a street scene taken by
Mr. Swank in West Middletown, Pa.

It's All Pittsburgh

Luke Swank is strictly ahome-town
photographer; all of his “One Man
Show” prints are of Pittsburgh
scenes. He regrets that many of the
nationally known artists who come to
Pittsburgh and comment on its artis-
tic beauty never paint a single local
scene.

Every one of Mr. Swank’s pictures
is taken without a tripod or special
equipment. The same pictures could
be taken with an ordinary $1.50

Sociologist
Discusses

Marriage

Marital Questions Treated
By Hartford Professor’
At Inquiry Monday

By John Martinco

The possibility of predicting the
outcome of marriage reliably has be-
come much greater, according to Dr.
Hornell Hart, sociologist of Hartford
Seminary, who addressed a small
“holiday” crowd at Monday’s session
of Inquiry, Forum.

Dr. Hart declared that “already
preliminary predictions with regard
to the outcome of marriage are so
promising that Within another gener-
ation or so, they will be as reliable
for marriage as insurance company
predictions are for insurance risks.”
“This is possible,” he continued, “if
we know more about the people.”

One of the prime factors in the
process of prediction, according to the
speaker, is age combination. “There
is an outstanding risk,” he said, “in
marriages showing a discrepancy of
ﬁve years between the couple, espe-
cially if the girl is only 17 or 18
years old. If a couple marries under
the age of 20, the chances for a
divorce are several times as great as
that of a couple marrying at 22 or
over.”

Risk Relatively Great

Likewise, he said that “a man of
35 or 40 can marry a woman ten
years younger than himself with
good prospects, while if a woman
marries someone seven years younger
than herself the risk is relatively
great.”

Another factor that he discussed
was that of religious combinations.
“It is more risky,” he reported, “for
a member of the Catholic faith to
marry a member of the Protestant or
Jewish faith than to marry in his own
belief.” The same conditions, he de-
clared, applied also to the Jews and
Protestants.

“The ideal marriage is one between
two persons who have the same re-
ligion,” the speaker declared. “On
the other hand, a marriage between
two people without any religion is
even more risky.”

He enumerated several other risky
combinations, including the happy-go-
lucky type with the methodical sort
of person, radicals and conservatives,
persons with jealous tendencies and
those who depend upon their mothers’

By William Stark

Incomplete returns on the presi-
dential poll being conducted by The
News, in co-operation with the Pitts-
burgh Press “America Speaks,”
seem to indicate conclusively that
undergraduates are favoring Presi-
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt by at
least a two to one margin.

T-he News will endeavor as nearly
as possible to reproduce and reﬂect
student sentiment by sampling ap-
proximately ten per cent of the en-
tire undergraduate student body, as
well as maintaining this ratio in the
various school-s, classes, and sexes.

Ten per cent of the women in the
School of Business Administration
were 100 per cent for Roosevelt.
Among the men in the same school,
Roosevelt led in the senior class by
three to one; in the junior class by
two to one; in the sophomore class
by seven to ﬁve; and in the freshman
class by two to one.

President Roosevelt

Leads In Student Poll

Incomplete Returns Indicate Overwhelming Victory For
Incumbent Among Undergraduate Students

Republican candidate L a n d o n
scored most decisively among senior
women in the College, running ahead
by about two to one.

President Roosevelt led among the
freshman, sophomore, and junior
class women by eight to one, two to
one, and eight to one, respectively.

Among the men in the College,
President Roosevelt led in the fresh-
man, sophomore, junior, and senior
classes by four to one, three to one,
ﬁve to one, and seven to one, re-
spectively.

Students in the School of Engi-
neering and Mines are split evenly
between support of President Roose-
velt and Governor Landon. Juniors
and seniors in the School of Educ-a-
tion are overwhelming in their sup-
port of President Roosevelt. Among
the unclassiﬁed group, President
Roosevelt made it a clean sweep,
leading in this group by two to one.

Assembly, In First Meeting
Tuesday, Has Abundance
Of Work—Schenck

As the SFA Executive Committee
met for the last time before the ﬁrst
general assembly meeting next Tues-
day, sub-committee chairmen indi-
cated that they were ready to con-
tinue their work, pending SFA’s ap-
proval.

Commenting upon the meeting held
late yesterday afternoon in the office
of the dean of men, William Schenck,
BA37, chairman of the executive
committee and president of the as-
sembly, indicated that the assembly
will have much work on when it be-
gins to discuss the projects to be
brought before it.

Said Schenck:
“We of the execu-
tive c o in mi ttee
have reason to be-
lieve that SFA has
an active, strenu-
ous year ahead
it. Our projects
are getting well
into line, and OT!
the whole we are
greatly pleased
with the progress
which has already
been made.”

The outstanding '
project upon which Louis Bearer
sub-committee chairmen are working
is the demonstrations block commit-
tee, headed by Louis Bearer, E37.
In explaining Bearer’s report to the
executive committee before the cheer-
ing block begins practice tomorrow,
Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men discussed the block’s prospects.

Other groups reporting progress
included the book chats and concert
hours committee, headed by William
Stark, C38, the University press com-
mittee, un-der Betty Rieger, C37, and
the pep assembly committee, under
Bernard McKenna, BA39.

FLAG BEARERSI

Columbus Day Celebration
Begins With Parade;
Ends In Court

     

Things have certainly come to a
pretty pass when people are arrested
for upholding the flag, Pitt students
are saying on campus today.

Eight undergraduates who joined
the huge Pitt Parade held Monday
in celebration of Columbus Day (and,
it is rumored, incidentally, that it

had something to do with Saturday’s
events close to an Ohio metropolis)
were arrested and taken into Central

_ Police Station charged with larceny.

The students, however, claim they
were merely upholding the flag as
any patriotic citizen would.

0 As the caravan of cars rooted and
to

oted through downtown Pittsburgh
several patriots jumped off the run-
ning boards of automobiles and pur-
loined ﬂags lining the sidewalks.

VVith ﬂags unfurled in the strong
wind, the parade continued. Duty-
bound police officers, however, failed
to discern the patriotic motive be-
hind the action, and taking hold of
as many flag-wavers as they could,
said, “C’mon wit us.” Eight stu-
dents, all male, were trotted to No.
1 Police Station and hailed before
Magistrates Stancati and Kearney.

Dr. Vincent Lanfear, dean of men,
appeared, and af-ter explaining the
patriotic motives behind the parade,
the eight were released on their own
recognizance.

However, the eight were brought
back to court yesterday morning,
pending the return of the other miss-
ing ﬂags.

Seniors To Enter
Fashion Contest

Women Wishing Designer’s
Career Invited To Join

Senior women interested in a career
of fashion designing are invited to
enter the Prix de Paris contest in
fashion designing, in which Miss
Frances McLaughlin, assistant dean
of women, won honorable mention
last year. It is again open to all
senior women at colleges or universi-
ties throughout the country.

The contest is conducted like a
course in fashions, with quizzes and
a ﬁnal thesis, and is sponsored by
Vogue, women's fashions magazine.
The ﬁrst prize offers a year’s em-
ployment with Vogue, during which
time six months are spent in Paris
and the remainder- in New York.
Salary and expenses are included.

Second prize is six months em-
ployment on the editorial staff of the
New York office. In addition, girls
who show unusual ability have a
chance to become identiﬁed with the
fashion department of leading
stores, clothing manufacturers, news-
papers and advertising agencies.

Any senior woman interested in en-
tering the contest can secure pam-
phlets with all details of this year’s
Prix contest from Miss Mary Garber,
secretary in the office of the dean
of women, at Heinz House.

SFA ‘Warns Rooters
Against Stadium Fires

Numerous complaints have been
received recently by the University
about the conduct of a few per-
sons sitting in the Pitt cheering
section at the football games, ac-
cording to an announcement by
the executive committee of SFA.
The complaints concern the build-
ing of ﬁres and scattering of pa-
pers throughout the section.

The c-om-mittee points out that
the wooden seats in the Stadium
have been paraffin treated and are,
therefore, readily 'inﬂamma.'ble.'i
Added to this, they announce, is
the danger that spectators’ cloth-
ing may become ignited and that
someone may be seri-o-usly injured.

Because of this, the committee
asks that students refrain from
any such pranks in the future, and
that they report any such actions
they may see.

take place tomorrow from 3:30 to 5
o’clock at Heinz House.

These dances, planned by the de-
partments of the deans of men and
women, are sponsored so that all
freshmen may have a chance to meeti
other members of their class. Thus

an effort will be made to see that as
many different people attend each
dance as possible.

The ﬁrst 75 men and the ﬁrst 65
women who request tickets for the
dance at the offices of the deans of
men and women, respectively, will be
permitted to attend the ﬁrst dance.
Those who wish to repeat attendance
at one of these affairs must wait un-
til the day of the repeat dance to
ask for tickets.

In all, four mixers have been sched- ;
uled. The second affair will be held]

Cap, Gown Club Alters
Constitution To Accept
Men With Year’s Work

 

Breaking a tradition of many years‘,
the Undergraduate Cap and Gown
Club, at a meeting Monday afternoon,
amended its constitution to provide
for the admittance of outstanding
men who have had only one year’s
experience in Cap an-d Gown produc-
tion.

The former ruling admitted only
those who were in at least two pro-
ductions. This kept out many men
who joined the show when juniors
and seniors. This new move will in-
crease the membership and activity
of the club, bringing new and out-
standing men into the organization.

Petitions for membership will be
available at the dean of men’s office,
Room 801, Cathedral, this afternoon.
They must be returned by Friday aft-

ernoon at ﬁve o’clock.

SF A Block

Practices
Tomorrow

Cheering Section, Equipped
In Gold, Blue, Prepares
For Duquesne Game

A cheering block of 800 stu-

.,dents wearing blue and gold re-

versible waterproof jackets will
make its ﬁrst appearance to a
Stadium audience at the Pitt-
Duquesne game Saturday.

This demonstration group, for
which SFA has been planning
since May, will appear in its
ﬁnal form under the leadership
of William Brinker, coach of
cheerleaders and assistant pro-
fessor of chemistry, and Louis
Bearer, E37, chairman of the
student committee in charge‘.

All the equipment has been secured
and will be distributed when the block
rehearses for the ﬁrst time tomorrow
afternoon at 4:30 o’clock in the Sta-
dium. ’

Students Must Be Present

According to Bearer, all those who
are not present at this rehearsal “will
disqualify themselves for further par-
ticipation, and their places will be

ﬁlled from a waiting list 200 strong.”
Members will receive notice of the
practice by mail. If these notices
are not received, information as to
section and leader will be provided
at the information boot-h.

A few changes have been made in
section assignments, Bearer said, but
only because certain sections were
overcrowded. He asks students to ac-
cept without question the sections to
which they are assigned. '

According to present plans, the
block will present a permanent “P”
in gold upon a background of blue
and vice versa. This may be varied
at will, with plans calling for a growl-
ing panther head, a tolling bell and
other. not-so-well-known color stunts.

To- Have Bi-Colored Cards

Each member of the block will
have bi-colored cards as an auxiliary
stunt medium. With these the Sat-
urday crowd will watch a red and
blue “D”' unpeel before their eyes,
and the cards will be used for other

‘stunts as the season advances.

Rehearsals will be held. every
Thursday at the same time until the
block is sufficiently well versed in its
exhibits to put them on with varia-
tions unpracticed. ' ' '

Panhel Group   _
To Plan For Rushing

Themes for the Women’s fall rush-
ing teas will be formulated by Pan-
hellenic Council tomorrow evening at
Heinz House. A dinner at 6 o’clock
will precede the business meeting. '

New rules and regulations forifall
rushing which will be held Sunday.
November 15, are to be announced
by Frances Calhoun, Ed37, chairman
of the Rushing Committee.

The list of eligible second semester
freshmen and upperclass women will
be read. These women must have a
1.0 scholastic average, and no failures
or incomplete grades will be eligible.
All NYA students will be ineligible
for rushing during this period.

Research Bureau Reports Trade Rise

USINESS conditions in the Pittsburgh area last week resumed
the rise which began early this year, according to the Bureau

of Business Research of the University. This was due for the
most part to an increase in volume of trade and a fairly large

rise in industrial production.

The iron and steel industry in the Pittsburgh district last

week was operating at about 75

per cent of capacity, a rate sub-

stantially above normal for this season of the year.

T THE Duquesne game, SFA’s cheering block will be intro-

duced to Stadium-goers for the ﬁrst time.

It will not only

be an innovation to the Pittsburgh district, but marks the ﬁrst time
such a project has moved farther east than the Mississippi.

An organized student cheering section was ﬁrst originated on
the west coast, cradled, fed, until today a football game there is

relatively drab without an elabora

te card stunt during the intermis-

sion periods. The idea has been carried so far that several schools

recognize substitutions by the spelling of the players’ names as

they enter and leave the game.

Pitt’s cheering block will hardly be that far advanced even by
the end of the season. However, according to reports, they may
have the Panther growling, and perhaps even standing up on. his
hind legs, provided the students practice and follow the d11‘€Ct10f1S
of Bill Brinker, cheer-leading coach, and Lou Bearer, student

chairman and organizer.

Approximately 850 students have already signed for positions
in the section, with several hundred more candidates expected be-
fore Saturday’s introduction of the block. At ﬁrst, the limit was

set at 500. However, now it may

be enlarged to allow for a wider

range of stunts. Membership in the block is virtually the same as

a reserved seat for every football
sition close to the 40-yard line. I

Students At Antioch Divide
Time Between Practical
Work, Scholarship

 

By Harrison Chandler: J'-

From Antioch College, America‘
“experiment in education,” where haﬁf
the students attend classes w.hile.t 63
other half work on co-0Pe1‘_3~"1%’Je _3°l:
in 20 different states, t0 thlsh gllvle
sity with its skyscraper Cat e ra-—
that is a big step. I made that step
this fall after having attended An-
tioch for one year.

Antioch has, instead of 12,000 
dents, only 650. In place of 3. m
story building and a massive sta lu ,
it possesses a beautiful, though l1nP1'e'
tentious, campus. This little college.
located at Yellow Springs: Ohm: has’

among other things, a student body A

representing 44 states and several
foreign countries.

Antiochians soon learn to travel.
Every ﬁve or ten weeks they pack
their belongings and move back and
forth from the campus to their co-
operative jobs, which are offered by
more than 200 leading ﬁrms through-
out the east and middle west.

Regardless of what a student’s ﬁeld
may be, Antioch’s personnel depart-
ment is able to give him a Posllilfm
related to his college curriculum. Biz-
ads, home-ecs, P1‘e'm9d5= and mg“
neers all get practical experience at
their jobs, and at prevailing wage
rates.

“Co-operation” is the by-word of
the campus. Students and faculty
alike are organized into the “Antioch
Community,” presided over by a stu-
dent manager, who must be consulted
on any general campus activity.

The barrier between the faculty
and students has been broken by the
friendly spirit that is inescapable
there. Students do not hesitate to
drop in at the homes of their in-
structors for counsel or for a friendly
chat.

The honor system is employed at
Antioch—and what’s more, it is suc-
cessful. Students are trusted not to
cheat on exams. Professors never
bother to remain in a classroom while
a test is in progress, and often they
hand out the questions with the in-
struction to “take them to your rooms
and bring them back Monday.”

Antioch has no varsity athletics,
except tennis. There are likewise no
men’s or Women’s fraternities. In
place of the former is a well-organ-
ized intra-mural sports program. In-
stead of the latter, the dormitories
are subdivided into halls, which com-

Everything on campus is student-
managed. Two students, as their co-
operative work, operate the Campus
Valet Service. This co-operative
business, which offers laundry and
cleaning service to the college, is
owned by the student body.

Another feature is Community Ser-
vice, to which every student devotes
two hours a week. Assignments vary
anywhere from feeding the white rats
used for research at the college to
writing copy for the Antiochian, the

This year, of course, is a time for
a large number of polls concerning
politics. Northeastern University
showed a preference for Landon. He
polled 424 votes to Roosevelt’s 172.
The faculty voted the same way as
the students.

At the University of Kentucky the
ﬁgures read the other way. Roose-
velt polled 221, with 166 for Landon.

Poet Scheduled

To Lecture Here
At State Session

Louis Untermeyer To Speak
At Education Conference
On Reading, Poetry

Louis Untermeyer, noted American
poet, anthologi-st, and critic, is sched-
uled to speak at two sessions of the
Western Pennsylvania Educati-on
Conference here. The Conference, of
which the University is a member, is
supported by state educational insti-
tutions and will take place from O'c-
tober 15 to 17.

Mr. Untermeyer is well known in
literary circles as the author of sev-
eral anthologies on British and Ameri-
can Poetry.

The poet, in his ﬁrst address, will
speak on “What Americans Read an-d
Why,” in the Soldiers’ and Sail-o-rs’
Memorial Hall on Saturday, October
17, at 10:30 o’clock.

He will be introduced by Miss
Ellen M. Geyer, chairman of the Eng-
lish section of the Conference and
professor of English and Education
at the University. Mr. Untermeyer’s
lecture will follow the address of
Robert X. Graham, director of the
University News Service and instruc-
tor in English here, on “Gathering
the News.”

“The Glory of the Commonplace”
is the subject of the poet’s second
address, scheduled for 2 o’clock the
same aftern-oon in the Memorial
Hall. He will be introduced by C. E.
Dickey, superintendent of the Alle-
gheny County Public Schools. The sub-
ject is a favorite with the poet, who
believes that modern poe-try shall ﬁnd
its theme in the glory of the every-
day things that we kn-ow and under-
stand.

Opinion .:.
By J. M. Eichelberger

I am rapidly becoming convinced

that the most a college education can
do is to en-able one to hold an in-tel-
ligent conversation. It used to be
that an aspiring young man of the
middle class went to college to in-
crease his earning capacity. In mod-
ern industry there was an apparently
insatiable demand for engineers, cost-
accountants, and executives. But,
nowadays, brains can be picked up
for almost nothing. Skilled laborers
command the high wages and Ph.D.’s
retire to the bread line.
_ Well, then, if a college education
is not going to get one a job, it cer-
tainly ought to do something; and I
personally think it will do a great
turn if it provides the background and
opportunity for students to grow into
acceptable conversationalists. This
will probably be appreciated more by
some of us than by others.

Some of us, under t-he impact of
present world conditions, have lost
the burning spirit of our fathers. We
haven’t the least desire to charge out
and set the worlds of ﬁnance and
business on ﬁre. Nor are we partic-
ularly eager to do or die for a
“cause,” for we have become some-
what skeptical of “causes,” be they
“Buy American” or “Save the Consti-
tution.” In fact, the least ephemeral
thing about the present state of the
nation seems to be the eleven million
unemployed, who promise to become
a rather permanent ﬁxture.

Such being the case, a number of
us are taking our conversation more
seriously, for the classes of ’37, ’38.
'39 and ’40 are going to have lots of
time on their hands. Consequently
there will be an increasing demand
for entertaining talkers.

But seriously now, won’t it be
grand about 1940 to look back on
your college days and say, “Ah, yes,
college truly did prepare me for life.

 

 

’ Have I not been voted the most bril-

liant conversationalist in the Unem-
ployed Workingmen’s Cultural Asso-
ciation, Local No. 76a? There’s noth-
ing like a college education!”

In fact, there’s nothing new what-
soever about the idea of colleges
training men to become talkers. Eng-
lisli universities have been doing pre-
cisely that for centuries. One has
only to look over a list of famous
British statesmen to ﬁnd numerous
Oxford and Cambridge graduates who
made their way in the world by talk-
ing. Long has been the tradition of
sons of Britain who learned blithe
conversation in Oxford dining halls
and glib debate in engagements with
Cambridge, and then succeeded in
talking their way into Parliament, or
into an imperial post in India. Of
course. their families’ wealth and po-
litical inﬂuence may have had a little
something to do with the phenomenal
success they achieved, but neverthe-
less these British Empire builders
were essentially talkers.

Even today the venerable old re-
fectories of Baliol and King’-s Col-
lege are training grounds for up and
coming young conversationalists. The
molecules of matter in the pewter
ware which vibrated to the voices of
great Britons now respond to new and
young sounds. Conversation in Ux-
ford is conducted in ritual. It be-
gins at the dinner table an-d continues
in the salon where all retire for cof-
fee and wine. Wine, it seems, is con-
sidered by the British to be a very
pleasant aid to conversation. It
stimulates the wit among other things.
Of course Americans have discovered
a couple of “Gin Bucks” to be even
more effective.

Smoker Postponed

Due to a conﬂict with the Western
Pennsylvania Education Conference,
the Faculty Club’s stag smoker,
scheduled for Thursday evening, Oc-
tober 15, has been postponed. The
new date will be announced later.

...He Talked To Himself...

By Milton Lehman

It's strange how columnists’ themes
change from year to ye-ar. Last night
I was looking through a ﬁle of the
News of two years ago, the News
when Herrymon Maurer, Ed Banks,
and other column commentators
dashed‘ off thirty and forty inches of
copy in spare moments. Andmighty
ﬁne copy at that. But it seemed that
every time the columnist wanted to
go literary, he jumped on Thomas
Hardy for his the-me. Columns were
ﬁlled with Hardy.

This year, to be different, perhaps,
this column and Mr. Eiclie1berger’s
“Opinion” started off with a study of
Thomas Wolfe. Wolfe is new and
affords new material for columnists.
Bu-t, strange to say, whenacolumnist
tries to be literary, his recommenda-
tions are usually laid aside for last
month's Esquire.

But back to Hardy. I'll admit I
never read any of his deep-seated
pessimism until this year, possibly be-
cause high school teachers and col-
umnists together managed to work
into me a sincere disregard for their
suggestions. Once I really did decide
to plough through a volume-of Hardy,
in spite of the approval of those in
the know: that was three years ago.

The “Native” Returns

I picked up a copy of “The Return
of the Native” in one of Market
Street’s second hand book stalls, and
sat down to do the deed. But Hardy
took me as far as page thirty, and no
further. I wanted excitement, and he
gave me description; I wanted melo-
drama reﬁned, and he gave me vul-
gar c-onversation. Then the “Native”
returned to my shelf and hasn’t
budged since.

But this year English 21 begins
with the announcement that it will
plunge the Hardy bolu-s down your
throat, whether or no. Whether you

had to swallow it.

Perhaps a blessing for me, they
chose Hardy’s “Far Fr-om the Mad-
ding Crowd” and let the “Native”
rest for a while. But the title wasn’t
any too convincing in the light of my

Discusses Marriage

(Continued from Page 1)

or fathers’ advice. “Some people,”
he added, “are bad risks no matter
who marries them.”

“An individual who is sexually pro-
miscuous is a poor marriage risk,”
he stated. “Also, intensive petting
before marriage is not conducive to
a happy marriage.”

Three Factors Necessary 

Dr. Hart listed three factors nec-
essary for ﬁnding a mate. The ﬁrst,
as he described it, is the ratio be-
tween the marriage proportions of
the opposite sexes; the second is the
extent to which an individual is mar-
riageable, and the third is the atti-
tude of the individual.

For marriage, he opined, a girl
must be reasonably attractive, have
some knowledge of preparing food,
and present a sympathetic attitude.
Her husband, in Dr. Hart’s opinion,
must be sympathetic, steady and a
good provider. The ideal age for}
marriage he placed between 24 and’
28 for women and 28-30 for men.
“The sooner one ﬁnds a mate after
the age of 22,” he stated, “the bet-
ter.”

“Marriage,” he concluded, “is one
of the ﬁnest ways of ﬁnding that life
is meaningful and, after all, that life
has been worth while.” I

I

distaste for the author. I thought
Hardy was “dead” three years ago
when I pried open one of his novels
for the ﬁrst time. Now I was sure of
it.

“Far From the Madding Crow-d,” I
knew, came- from Gray's “Elegy
Written in a Country Church Yard,”
and that title wouldn’t all-ow for to-o
much life. But the book was assigned.

Not A Hardy Man

I sailed through the ﬁrst ten chap-
ters, almost forgetting that I wasn’t
a Hardy man. Gabriel Oak was
really “fai from the madding crowd,”
but he had a story to tell, and I
wanted to hear it. Bathsheba Ever-
dene developed from a silly farmer
girl to an imperious, bewitching, and
imp-ossible farmer. Professor Jones
claimed that Hardy’s theory was that
a woman always “stirs up things.”
Bathsheba did.

I’m still following the assign-
ment, and have seen Bathsheba break
one heart, tear violently into another,
fall in love with one more that, I be-
lievc, d-oesn’t a-che for her; an-d she
will marry . . . but I don’t know yet.
Hardy has that up his wide sleeve,
and I’ll have to wait until the assign-
ment says “Read to conclusion of
book.”

Hardy isn’t bad at all. In fact he's
quite good. His writing is as rustic
as the people of whom he writes, yet
it is vii-ile and couched in a deep-
seated philosophy. And as for his
pessimism . .
word. Everyone else has.)

Let you know how the story ends

rations for the brunch, senior women
serving will wear white caps and
aprons to carry out the motif for
the initial affair of the senior class.

Coffee and well-browned hamburg-
ers will be the drawing card for the
luncheon, which will also serve as a
mass meeting for the class members.
Chairman of the brunch is Betty Bry-
son, Ed37, who promises Barbara
Thomas, BA37, senior class presi-
dent, a large turnout.

Harriet Lewis, Ed37, class treas-
urer, will be on hand at the luncheon

powerhouse football squad as a re-
sult of its smashing win over the high-
ly rated Ohio State team, Dr. “Jock”
Sutherland sent his Panthers through
two long scrimmages at. the practice
ﬁeld Monday and Tuesday.

Up on the Trees ﬁeld things
hummed as though the Buckeyes had
plastered a 40-0 defeat onto the Pitt
team. “Jack's” after the game
statement, “I am well pleased,” may
have certainly been meant but he is
taking no chances on a possible let-
down against the Duquesne Dukes

The Dukes have whipped through
three games this season without a de-
feat and have shown that they really
have something over there on the
Bluff in the way of a football team.
Hold-ing the city title, Smith’s lads
would go through hell and high-water
to take the Panthers this Saturday.
And that is why Sutherland has not
let up in the practice drills.

Lezouski Moves Up

One change in the Pitt lineup came
from the Ohio State game, the change
sending Al Lezouski u-p to the ﬁrst
team’s right guard position which
Dante Dalle Tezze had formerly held.
Lezouski, only a sophomore, is one of
the hardest hitting linemen on the
Panther squad. In the Buckeye game
he made the All-America-n State line-
men look like a couple of freshmen
when he repeatedly broke through
their line to nab the ball-carrier.

Today the Panthers will be shown
the moving pictures taken of last Sat-
urda-y’s battle. As a whole, the squad
was pretty well bruised up from
smacking the ‘Buckeyes so hard and
so often. Biff Glassford, Don Hens-
ley, Bobby LaRue, ’G'eo‘r‘ge Delich,
Marshall Goldberg and most of the
others have minor injuries.

Olympic Pictures Shown

Carl Olson, assistant professor
of physical education, will show mov-
ies of the Olympic Games Thursday
at 8‘ o'clock in Room 1001, Cathe-
dral, for the meeting of the Swedish-
Ladies’ Auxiliary of the Swedish Na-

tionality Room. Mrs. K-ahl is chair-
man of the meeting. '

ketball tournament, which had been
postponed to the week of October 19
in order that it would not conflict
with Coach Olson’s track meet, are
nearing completion.

An opportunity for those boys with

overgrown feet to transform them
into an asset instead of a liability has
been offered by Dr. Carlson in his

award for the entrant possessing the
largest peddles. Big heads will not
be overlooked, nor will the most
unique uniform or the largest hand-
spread.

The entries turned in so far indi-
cate a tourney dominated by the
frosh. Sophomores, one of whom
should take home the prize for the
biggest head, are surprisingly absent
from the entrance list. Among those
entered are Eph Werner, E40; Jim
Mccance, BA40; Joe Kristufek,
BA4-0; Bert Jaﬂ"Ie, C40; Howard C.
Lyons, C40; Wakeﬁeld Murray,
BA40; George Naismith, C40; John
Robinson, E40; Ed Steiner, C40;
Clyde S-hiring, E40, and Bob Burns,
C40.

Frateriiity‘ Football Will
Begin Next Wednesday

Interfraternity touch football will
start off with true Olympic spirit
when it opens Wednesday, October
19. The teams will consist -of nine
men with each fraternity permitted
to hold eight substitutes in reserve.

Three games will be played each
week by each of the thirteen frater-
nities. Play-off will be held on No-
vember 25.

Applications are being sent to the
fraternities this week. These are to
be returned to Robert Corley, as-
sistant dean of ‘men in charge of
fraternities. I-F Council will pay

the fee of $1.00 which is charged all «

teams entering the competition.

 

Touch Football Entries

As the Intramural Touch Foot-
ball League is scheduled to start
next Wednesday, October 19, all
entries for the league must be
turned in before the end of this
week to Martin Feely, director of
intramural athletics. En-try blanks
may be obtained from Mr. Feely
or at his office in the Trees Gym-

Squeaks from fast—stepping rub-
ber soles, along with the swish of a
long arching goal and the plunk-
plunk of the practicing dribbler re-
sound through the Stadium court
these days. All of which means that
Dr‘. Carlson’s cagers have started
back to practice again.

The good doctor’s 1936-37 edition
of the Panther basketeers trotted
out for their pre-season drills last
week. After two weeks of calls-
thenics, passing and shooting prac-
tice, relays, and whatev-er else it
takes to whip a ﬁrst class college
squad into shape, the boys will settle
down to some earnest preparation for
the season opener at Northwestern,
December 11.

If the number of varsity members
returning can be used as any indi-
cation of what to expect this winter,
Pitt opponents will need an extra
large supply of headache powders.

Early Pittsburgher Shown
As Rugged Frontiers man

Born In Scotland, Judge Brackenridge Became Leader
In Cultural Development Of Frontier Pittsburgh; .
Helped Pittsburgh Academy Get Its Start

By this time Judge Hugh Henry
Brackenridge has become almost a
mythical ﬁgure in Pennsylvania his-
tory.

But in actuality, Judge Bracken-
ridge was not a myth, but a very
real man-—tall, stately, educated, and
a severe schoolmaster. Possessing
the rugged qualities of the frontiers-
man, he still had the desire for cul-
ture in himself and in the people
with wh-om he lived. He was a leader
in the civic activities of that early
day when Pittsburgh was a cluster
of cabins near the Point and savage
Indians roamed the hills and valleys
of Western Pennsylvania.

On September 7, 1786, Bracken-
ridge succeeded in getting 5,000
acres of land set aside as an en-
dowment for the Pittsburgh Acad-
emy through his capacity as‘ state
legislator. The Academy, a on-e-
room schoolhouse, evolved into the
University that, this year, celebrates
its 150th anniversary.

The Judge arrived in the frontier
village of Pittsburgh in December,
1780. Years later he wrote his rea-

sons for leaving Philadelphia, where -

he had practiced law.

“When I left Philadelphia, almost
twenty years ago, I saw no chance
of being anything in that city; there
were such great men before me:
Dickinson, Wilson, etc., and I pushed
my way to these woods where I
thought I might emerge one day, and
get forward myself in a congress or
some other public body.”

Brackenridge was interested in
“these woods.” He proposed and
succeeded in making Pittsburgh the
seat of a new county, Allegheny. He
persuaded John Scull of Philadelphi-a
to come to the vill-age in 1786 to
publish and edit a newspaper. He

. presented a bill in the state congress
to establish a church here, and suc-

ceeded in having the bill passed. His

‘interest in promoting the state rati-

ﬁcation of the Federal Constitution
branded him as a co-ngressional lead-
er.

Judge Brackenridge was born in
Scotland in 1748. He came to

Kodak. Negatives are never faked,
or retouched, or worked over, and
the University photographer has
snapped everything from steel mills
to cowboys in Pittsburgh.

“It’s getting placed in life that
counts,” say-s Mr. Swank. “I am
happy in my work because it's the
work that is the most interesting to
me. My only thrill in life i-s seeing
negatives come out of the dark box
showing just what I want them to
show. I have taken hundreds of
pictures that I never have printed.”

Art in photography is easy, ac-
cording to Mr. Swank. You must
know a little about lights and color
and then just use your head, The
hardest part is knowing what to take
a picture of. An inherited artistic
sen-se and th- ability to see a picture
when one presents itself is the secret
of success in photography, Mr.
Swank contends.

America at the age of ﬁve, was a
schoolmaster at the age of 15, and
was graduated from the College of
New Jersey, which later became
Princeton. He was a minister at the
time of the Revolutionary War, and
practiced law in Philadelphia.

A journalist of local importance,
he wrote a number of articles for
the Pittsburgh Gazette. And, as a
writer of contemporary note, he pub-
lished “The Modern Chevalier,” a
narrative poem, and “Modern Chiv-
alry,” a novel upon which his fame
chieﬂy rests.

Judge Brackenridge brought cul-
ture to the Point, in a trinity of the
church, the school, an-d the news-
paper. The church was the First
Presbyterian, the school the Pitts-
burgh Academy, and the news-paper,
the Pittsburgh Gazette.

STORY OUT!

Former Dean Spencer Lifts
Pitt Sign While At Tech

College deans are by tradition up-
right and austere. Pinc-e-nez glasses
and a high, stiff collar are character-
istic of the breed, most people think;
it is even suspected that such men
wear long underwear and
never leave home without rubbers.

But the University not so long ago
had a dean who in his younger days
must have left a liberal sprinkling of
wild oats in his wake, if one may
judge by an incident.

Dr. Herbert L. Spencer, n-ow presi-
dent of PCW, served as dean of the
College before going to the Wood-
land Road institution in 1935. While
the doctor was at the University, the
story never got out, but now it may
be told. .

Carnegie Tech is Dr. Spencer's
alm-a mater. While a student there,
the dean-to-be and some adventure-
some friends, apropos to an impor-
tant football tussle, made a night sally
onto the campus here and t-ore down
the large “Pitt” electric sign which
use-d to ﬂank the hill up where the
stadium now stands.

And, we are told, his friends cried,

“He Tech it away!”

Dr. Taylor Opens
 Math Colloquium

Professor Reviews Theses
Presented At Convention

A portion of the program of the
Harvard Tercentenary was reviewed
yesterday, when Dr. J. S. Taylor, pro-
fessor of mathematics, addressing the
ﬁrst meeting of the Mathematics
Colloquium, spoke on the conference
of the American Mathematical Soci-
ety held during that convention.

He devoted his talk principally to
the papers of two famous mathema-
ticians, Professor Levi-Civita and Dr.
A. E. Eddington.

Professor Levi-Civita, of the Uni-
versity of Rome, presented a new
mathematical method by which scien-
tists and astronomers may seek a
check on the validity of the famous
Einstein theory, which is based on
the double star phenomena. It was
Professor Levi-Civita who developed
the mathematics which Professor Ein-
stein used originally in proving his
theory.

Dr. Taylor reported on the thesis
of Professor Eddington because of a
peculiarity that arose in his solving
of a problem involving both relativ-
ity and quantum mechanics. As a
by-product of his result Professor Ed-
dington discovered the number of

K electrons in the universe to be ten to

the 90th power.

On Thursday, October 15, Dr. Tay-
lor will be in Erie to speak to the
Mathematics section of the Erie
County Institute. His address will
be given in the Lawrence Park High
School.

Collegians Dsert Plaids;

Fashions Go Conservative

Pitt News Style Expert Discovers College Men Lean
Toward Plain-Backed Grey, Brown Sports Coats,
Two-Toned Shirts With Semi-Stiff Collars

By Leonard Seder

Raccoon coats and corduroy trou-
sers are no longer with us. Nor is
the correct attire for collegians a
checkered, gathered-back sport coat
with checkered tro-users, a plaid shirt,
and a blazing plaid bowtie.

The collegiate has gone conserva-
tive. Most of the best shops are sell-
ing sport coats with plain easy ﬁtting
backs. Again, plain shades of brown
and grey or conservative checks are
replacing the ﬂamboyant coats which
you can’t help gape at as they brush
by on Forbes or Bayard streets.

Duke of Kent button-dowr. collars
which were the mo-de a few months
ago are now only worn by those of
us who can’t afford the latest style
two-toned shirts with semi-stiff at-
tached collars.

According to this month's Esquire,
small-ﬁgured ties of contrasting col-
or to the body of the shirt should be
worn to offset the white collar and

cuffs. The two-toned background of
these new shirts makes a bowtie look
ridiculous. Put it is my guess that
the next Tea Dance will be ﬂooded
with such combinations.

Zippers have bec-ome almost indis-
pensable in the assembling of men’s
trousers. It has reached a point that
no self-respecting college student will
be able to feel at ease without boast-
ing a Talon-slide-fastener.

The latest novelty in men’s fur-
nishings is the new sock with garter
attached. Gerald M-cCann, New York
men’s fashion authority, writes me
that “the garter is knitted elastic
band about three-quarters of an inch
wide, which is joined to the top of
the sock across the front, but left
free in back so that it can be slipped
up over the calf. Laundering will not
take the stretch out of the elastic.”

Who can tell but that this innova-
tion will spell the death of the tradi-

Dr. s. H. Williams
Talks At Seminar

Biology Professor Stresses
Initiative To Engineers

 

Dr. Samuel H. Williams, professor
of biology, recounted many of his
experiences and observations in for-
eign lands to the members of the com-
bined aeronautical and mechanical en-
gineering seminars at their meeting
last Thursday.

Pointing out to the engineers the
need of force, ability and leadership
in their work,‘ Dr. Williams said,
“Engineering is a game in which you
must have ability to produce the
goods. You can’t build a bridge by
blufﬁng. So, while you have the
chance, get the best training you
can.”

Dr. Williams emphasized that in ad-
dition to engineering ability, social
polish is a necessary qualiﬁcation for
reaching the top, especially in tropi-
cal countries, where much of the en-
gineering work of the future will be
done.

In closing, he remarked: “Remem-
ber that all education is not intended
to teach you to make a 1iving—much
of it is designed to teach you how to

live.”

Dance Postponed

(Continued from Page 1)
next Tuesday, October 20; the third,
Friday, October 23, and the fourth
probably Monday, October 26.

Tickets which were issued for the
postponed affair on Monday will
probably be good for the fourth dance
on October 26, according to Theodore
W. Biddle, assistant to the dean of
men.

The same orchestra that was sched-
uled for Monday, the one directed by
Bob Duncan, ChE37, will provide the
music for tomorrow’s dance, and the
hostesses who were to appear at the
ﬁrst dance have consented to ofﬁciate
at the second. Harry Harrison, of
the physical education department, is
still slated as the master of cere-
monies.

The hostesses supplied by the So-

cial Committee of WSGA are Thyrsa
Agness Amos, C38; Lyda Baltz, C37;
Doris Grennan, C39; Rose Nugent,
Ed38; Marion Patterson, Ed38; Ruth
Rosenthal, C38; Betty Scott, Ed38;
Betty Wainwright, BA37; Ione Wil-

R. X. Graham Finds Himself Stumped,

Can’t Figure Out

Psychologists in inventing maze
passages for testing the intelligence
of white rats have nothing on the
designers of the new Cathedral ele-
vator system, in the opinion of R.
X. Graham, instructor in journalism.

Mr. Graham is ﬁrmly convinced
that the system was devised to test
the practical intelligence of Pitt
teachers and professors.

Not so long ago, Mr. Graham,
known to his intimates as “Eggsy,”
had a hankering to get from the
eighth floor to the seventeenth. Hav-
ing heard of the new elevator regu-
lations, Mr. Graham sat down to
think.

He summed up the facts as fol-
lows: Local cars stop only on ﬂoors
ﬁve, seven, nine, eleven and thirteen;
express cars stop only on fourteen,
ﬁfteen, sixteen, seventeen, etc. Stu-
dents who wish to go to ﬂoors six,
eight, ten, etc., go to the ﬂoor above
and walk down one.

But how to get from eight to sev-
enteen?

Mr. Graham, after much cogitation,
found two solutions to the puzzle:

He would either walk from eight

Cathedral Elevators

down to seven, take the “local” to
thirteen, walk to fourteen, and take
the “express” to seventeen; or, he
would walk from eight to seven, take
the elevator down to the ﬁrst ﬂoor,
and then take the express to seven-
teen!

Life certainly becomes more com-
plicated every day.

Choral Will Entertain
At Glee Club’s Dinner

Members of the Women’s Choral

a dinner to be held at Heinz House

at 6 o’clock next Tuesday. Follow-
ing dinner, there is to be a rehearsal
of college singing in anticipation of
the opening of the library rooms. to
parents Thursday evening, October 22.

At that time parents are to be con-
ducted through the University library
under the direction of Miss Thyrsa
W. Amos, dean of women. At the
end of the ceremony both glee clubs
will sing. Dancing will follow Tues-

day’s rehearsal.
