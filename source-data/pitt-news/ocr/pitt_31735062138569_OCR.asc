. Those words are familiar to every Pitt student. We sing
them many times during our four years as undergraduates at
the University. And during those four years, the words take
,on more andmore meaning. V

. _ We are glad, tosing them, for our Alma Mater is wise
and glorious.

_ Perhaps we do not appreciate just how glorious. That ap-
preciation comes only after we really know Pitt. There are so
many parts tothis University and it is only when we get an
over-al1‘picture of the various parts that we can appreciate it.

, This appreciation starts whenwe are Freshman. Each
"day we make new discoveries. The beautiful windows in Heinz
" "Chapel," the peaceful atmosphere in the Commons Room, the
 ifpuniof working on a student publication, the close companion-
ship of fraternity life, the teamwork in various extra-circular
activities,“ the traditional ceremonies which have become a.
 part of student life here, the startling facts about out-
standing faculty members—all these things we discover. Each
of us must make the diswveries for purselves.

i .  The Cathedral‘ of Learning towers up to the sky for a
‘ treason. It symbolizes the search for- truth which reaches ever
upward. We are here to seek truth. A, The Cathedral does not
come-to a pointiat the top. Again there is a reason. The search
 a stopping point. » '

 ,. While we” are students, our Alma Mater offers us many
* ways of learning theories and facts which will help us to come
nearer to the truth. We are given teachers to guide our think-
 iiiig_and books to openlnew ﬁelds of thought for us. What we
 here will serve as a light to guide us through life.

.  That our University has been victorious over fate and
, »-”’ jfpe, is’ apparent in this time of war. There are many who
would destroy our system of education in the world today‘. But
‘Pitthas not closed its doors.’ It is true that many things have
‘changed at the University since that day two years ago when
many of us sat in the Tuck Shop and listened to President
Roosevelt declare war on Japan. . ‘

‘I ‘Many who were with us that day. are now in the service
ioﬂtheir country. Some have given their lives‘ for our way of
;_l,i£e,.[ But there are many of us still here, and there are new-

omers to help us hold fast to the spirit of Pitt.  
 The University is still “dowered with eternal youth.”

 f_,‘Tonight the Chancellor is entertaining the parents of
eshman students. We are glad to welcome them to visit and

of this Freshman class will contribute to the life of our Uni-
‘rsity. Let us hope that they will come to love Pitt as we do.

I Then they will join us in our prayer: “Dear old Pitts-

Comments under the clock: “How
about buying your Owl from me?”
“Buy one? I’m selling them my-
self.” There’s more throat cutting
done on Owl sales than at Druid
elections, when there used to be
elections.

A few years ago Al McArdle
was one of the Tuck Shop stal-
warts but he’s been ably replaced
by his sister, Wilda McArdle who
has a way about her that points
to her being one of the top Owl
. salesmen. At least Don _McKee
seems to think so, judging from
‘that, uh, blank look.

For the second week in .a row we
have two outstanding nominations
for. “Squirrel of the Week”, and
Bob McKee comes out a shade ahead
of John «Kenny. Bob rated the nod
when he said.he was scanning the
posted physics 3 grades looking for
the “A” students to tap to Chi ,Rho
Nu and also looking for the ,“D’s”
-for possible‘ Druid tapees. Kenny

-gets consideration on general prin-

ciples and for catching his own cat
for catanatomy. ,

. Another, but not the least, two-
some is‘ Garnett McMarliii and

,'Bill Humes. And‘ dominating the

Jean Gouslie ﬁeld seems to be Jim
Maloney.

Braintruster Dick Barnhart is
spending his idle hours down in
the 'ZTA booth with reckless aban-
don. , Only candidate for spending
moretime honors is Walt Popeil,
‘sociology genius.‘ .
More popular than ever, AST
Dave, Armbruster spends his free
time at. a certain women’s fratern-
ity house with a, different woman
on as many different occasions.
Dan Fisher is _ having trouble
carrying around those bags under
his eyes (from overwork of

Painting Exhibit
Now, On Display

A display in modern painting,
produced by notables such as De-

"gas, Gauguin, van Gogh, Renoir,

Roualt, and Bingham, will be ex-
hibited in the University’s Fine Arts
Library from December 3 to 15.

New York’s Museum of Modern
Art, in collaboration with the Phil-
' lips Memorial Gallery in Wash-
ington,‘ has gathered these repro-
ductions and sketches together as
a demonstration of the close rela-
tionship of elementary design and
emotional eﬁccts in modern paint-
ing. —

Concurrent with "this" exhibit and
remaining until December 20, is a
collection of lithographic, engrav-
ing, and etching materials, loaned
by the Graphic Arts Division of the
National Museum in Washington.
Also shown are the processes of pho-
tographic reproduction into half
tone, collotype, photo, and rotograv-
ure.

‘ Pfc. “Lucky” Stainbrook must
have been born with a whole set of
silverware in his mouth The follow-
ing tale will testify to that.

While passing the Nixon theatre
one day last week, Stainbrook was
suddenly confronted with a‘ gener-
ous stranger who offered-him a free
ticket to “Sons of Fun.”

Appreciatively accepting the

ducat, “Lucky” found thathe had
been given a reservation for a
6th row ‘seat. But as he started to
sit down, he was whisked up on
the stage by Olson and Johnson,
the stars of the show, and intro-
F‘ duced to the audience. ‘

Thereupon, Stainbrook was pre-
sented with a beautiful Gruen watch
(he had previously won the watch
he was wearing), a case of, beer, a
can of pretzels,'a kit-full of candy
and cookies, a strategy game, and
two passes for dinner at Nixon’s
cafe.

But this is the pay-off! Stum-
bling out of the theatre with the
gifts piled high in his arms, he
nearly dropped everything when
the owner of a passing .limousine
stopped and oﬁ'ered to drive him
home. “Lucky” ate dinner at the
driver’s magniﬁcent home -on
Thanksgiving Day.

With men who know him best,
it’s"‘Lu'cky”' 1000 to 1.

By PFC. DAN KURZMAN, CO. H, AST

too much for a score of AST men
who were hypnotized last week by
Sgt. Ernest Feldman. 7
While under the hypnotic spell,
the victims were lulled into a
deep sleep, saw books ﬂoating in
mid-air, and made ridiculous fac-
es and remarks that had the au-
dience rolling in the corridors.
The act was climaxed when one of
the boys, still under the spell,
turned out all the lights on the
ﬂoor at'10 o'clock sharp.

(If only we had asked for the
phone numbers of those three beau-
tiful blondes that kept insisting we
kiss them.) ’

Typical ‘inspection-preparation
scene last Friday night : Company
H boys sweeping a roomful of ex-
cess dirty water into a hole in the
ﬂoor of about one inch circumfer-
ence. Were they stumped when
the hole ﬁnally ﬁlled up and a
reconnaissance ‘squad failed to
ﬁnd another one.

At last “Der Taug”! Hundreds of
AST men are waiting restlessly for
that ﬁnal minute of the term to-
morrow, when they will toss ’ aside
their books and dash for home—not
to return for six days.

They will be headed for every
part of the country—from Maine -
to California. Trains, airplanes
and buses will be packed with the
boys. ‘

All week long, the men have con-
ﬁned their thoughts to their folks
and their one-and-only (during ex-
ams, too). Somehow, it won’t seem
natural to have dates almost every
night without a constant fear of
lurking M. P.’s. Nor will it seem
natural to sleep until 11 o’clock
each morning without having at bu-
glb blast us out of bed.

Yes, tomorrow we’re going home.
And we’re happy. ‘

As an old convert to the fatigue curve, a theory that was
 yplyed-, sponsored,‘ and promoted at every spare moment by
Dhzﬁrcarlson until the Army took over, made him their surgeon
‘ﬂoral,’ and relieved him of any and all spare moments, we
 eéfishat Notre Dame’s 19-14 upset loss to Great Lakes was
 unexpected. V _ _
fatigue curve, whose most extravagant fans insist

9,   everything but the color of a person’s eyes and his
,/fa: oi;ite'breakfast food, is based on the premise that (1) as
‘ yoiu-giivork you tire and (2) once a person reaches his peak, he

ajebﬁfﬁibuted materially to the myth of invincibility that grew

 from a Notre Dame press release prior to the open-
, game.’ “It has become painfully evident to Frank Leahy”,

  of last year's squad and a fewsophomores.”
  A. ,.’:'Since the ‘ﬁmembers of last year’s squad” included An-

zt was a lad «named Johnny Lujack, ‘it may be assumed
R‘!ra.,that%,vsuch painful observations would have ‘been more than

we}:

   

  

     
   
  
  

 endured by almost any‘ other coach .in the country.
 story is told that-following the Notre Dame-Iowa Sea-

Phi Gains Beat A

lDelts in First

I-F Cage Game

Phi Gamma Delta downed Delta
Tau Delta, 39-17, in the ﬁrst game
of the Intramural Basketball season
Wednesday night at Trees gym. The
teams were matched fairly closely
until the third quarter when the
Phi Gams piledup a seven- point
lead, followed by a fourth quarter
showing the Delts scoring two points
to their opponent’s seventeen.

Matter and Reppert, outstanding
for the winners, scored ten points
each. Maloney and Holenbeck were
Delt high scorers. Steytler and also
Maloney of the losers were banished
from the game on fouls. The game
was refereed by Intramural Director
Mike Josephs.

The SAE-Phi Delt game sched-
uled for yesterday was postponed
until before the Christmas vacation.
One independent team has entered
the league competition, bringing the
number of teams to ten. The next

-league games will be played Wed-
nesday and Thursday of next week.

Basketball managers are need-
ed. Students interested should
contact Roy Reinhard, senior
manager. ‘ S

Three Pitt players won mention
on the Associated Press All - State
Team. Francis Mattioli, regular
Pitt guard, was nominated on the
second team-—but as a tackle!

Two of the Pitt.17-year-olds won
honorable mention on the team.

These were Joe Mocha, the quarter-
back, and Tom Kalmanir, who
played halfback. Kalmanir might
well have come close to leading the
State, if not -the country, in the
number of touchdowns scored, had
it not been for a succession of bad
breaks.

He scored four touchdowns legal-
ly. Two touchdown runs of 25 and
65 yards, respectively, were called
back because of clipping penalties
against his team. On one occasion
he carted the ball‘-to the two-yard
line——and someone else carried ‘it
over. In the -Ohio’ State game, he
took the ball to what‘ the official eye
judged to be the one-inch line—and
Jack Itzel carried it for the touch-
down.

Pitt might be also credited with
an assist 'on.'at least two other play-
ers_ who were named to the All-‘State
Team. Bill Abromitis, who started
the season in a Pitt uniform and

ﬁnished the season in a Penn State

Parents Receive
Souvenir Boolélet

II . ,, . II
. TraInIngToWIn
; One of the two souvenirs parents
{will take home from the Reception
tonight is a booklet entitled “Train-
ing to Win.”
This special brochure is a pic-
ture of the University in war-
, time. It is intended especially to
.preserve a record of the Univer- _
-».sity during V the war ' years, al-
: though its complete aim is to pre-
sent a picture of the all-time Uni-
: versity—ilts aims and purpose in
- war and peace-time as well.

“Training to Win” tells the com’- _

.ple'te story of the training Pitt is
giving soldiers and civilians to help
';win' the war. Sections. are devoted
to Pitt's military program, teach-
ing women war work, scientiﬁc re-
Search for war ‘ends, and teaching

,:aviation, navigation, and other

skills. . . _
A Part of the 120 illustrations in-
clude some of the outstanding Pitt
men in service.
Letters from many parts of the
country commend “Training to"
Win.” Dr. Eugene A. Gilmore,
former president of Iowa. State
University and now member of
its law faculty, calls it superb, a
very artistic and harmonious story
of the University. “It not only tells
the story of the work the Univer-
sity is doing in‘ war training,” he

1 comments, “but it gives an e_xcel-_

lent picture of the nature and spir-
'_it of the institution.” ' , ’ ' ‘

1 Mrs. Agnes L. Starrett, editor of
“Training to.Win,” has also edited
the University quarterly, “Pitt,”

I since 1939. “Pitt” interprets the‘. Un-

iversity to students, faculty, the
community, and other universities.
