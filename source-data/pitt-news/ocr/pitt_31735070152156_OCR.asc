The loudest and longest applause during
the State of the Union Address resounded
on Capitol Hill not_for any of the presi-

soldier. “ \

Sgt; -First Class Cory Remsburg sat
beside first lady Michelle Obama, asthe
president spent a portion of his State

describing the injuries'that Army Ranger
suffered during service. Remsburg took
shrapnel in his brain when a roadside
bomb exploded in Afghanistan during
his 10th overseas deployment.

Cameron Linton, president of Pitt’s‘

College Republicans who belongs to the
Republican party, described the televised
moment as “one of the most moving

wages have barely budged.”
Several times during his address,
Obama described his ad~m‘inistration’s

“ proposals as “concrete” measures to

promote economic growth and expand
the middle class. i
Obama was especially vocal about im-
proving unemployment beneﬁts.
He said Congress recently allowed
unemployment insurance to expire for
4 1.6 million Americans who were between
jobs. He called on Congress to renew un-
employment benefits to promote those
who were looking for work. He also called
on private businessesto hire more long-

The calculator uses the ‘four re-

“The Real Food Challenge gives stu— _

dents the opportunity to learn more
about a food system that truly nourishes
producers, consumers, communities and
the earth,” McDonald said..

Suler said she and the rest of the stu-

‘ dents working on the Real Food ‘Chal-
lenge have not yet calculated the per-

centage of realfood,-selrved at Pitt. The
group will determine that number based
on the calculatilngl system, which they

Pennsylvaniavoter ID law should remain unconstitutional  

Matt Barnes
Columnist

’ On;]an. 18, 2014, Pennsylvania Common-

wealth Court Judge Bernard McGinley
struck down Pennsy1vania’s voter ID law,
which mandates that constituents present
a state-issued or state-recognized.phot0_
ID in order to vote. .

In_'today’s world, such a requirement
seems completely reasonable. After all,
photo identiﬁcation is a means to verify
legitimacy in countless situations, such as-
entering a Pitt dormitory, driving a car or
viewing an R-rated movie. ,

Isn’t it time that voting precincts en-
force similar measures to prove validity?
Actually, it’s not.

Article VII of the Constitution of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania -is titled
“Elections” and consists of 14 sections.

These provisions guarantee citizens the

fundamental right of any true representa-

tive democracy: the right to vote.
Unjustiﬁably restricting that right is
not only unconstitutional, but an abridge-
ment of freedom altogether. There is a role
for government, without a-doubt. Govem—
ment has the ability to successﬁilly pro-'
mote liberty and justice. However, action
must be taken with caution. Such liberty

A and justice can only come about when‘gov-

ernmental actions are justiﬁed and aimed

toward a particular’ and existent problem. _

’ The Pennsylvania voter ID law doeslnot
justify its intent because the problem that.
it supposedly helps to ﬁx does not exist.
According to a 2012 court ﬁling by the
commonwealth of Pennsylvania,,there
“have been no investigations or prosecu-
tions of in—person voter fraud in Penn-
sylvania,” nor did it have any “personal

knowledge of any such investigationsor
prosecutions in other states.”

Therefore, the commonwealth in-
directly exposed that ulterior motives,
rather than pure legislative efﬁcacy toward
a nonexistent problem, wasbehind the
law's conception. In 2012, Pennsylvania
House Majority Leader Mike Turzai ignit-
ed controversy when he remarked that the
new voter ID law would “allow Gov. [Mitt]
Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania.”

Why wouldsimply-having to obtain a
state-issued ID tilt the state toward the
right?

The answer to this question relates di-
rectly to the restriction of constitutional
voting rights mentioned- above.

It is estimated that the law would have
kept 750,000 Pennsylvaniansfrom voting
— most of whom were expected to vote

Democrat. This act of disenfranchisement,
justiﬁed on the basis of an imaginary prob-
lem, clearly contrasts the commonwealth’s
constitutional duty to promote voting ac-
cessibility. McGinley concurred, writing
“disenfranchising voters through no fault
of the voter himself is plainly unconsti-
tutional.”

The role of government, whether 10-
cal, state or national, should not be to
restrict rights, but to protect them. The
Pennsylvania voter ID law contributes to
the former ratherthan to the latter. A

Most of the 750,000 would—be disen-
franchised voters are urban poor, elderly
and disabled individuals without adequate
access to state-issued or state-recognized
IDs. — I ‘ * *

also found the burdensome..na.ture of the

law problematic, stating that “the provi-
sions of the voter ID law  unnecessarily
burden the hundreds of thousands of elec-
tors who‘ lack compliant photo ID.” The
ﬁght over the law will surely continue and
be appealed to a highercourt.

MEN’S BASKETBALL ,

-New coaches s

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staff Writer

By and large, it takes years for newly
hired coaches to build reputable cellege
basketball programs. H 4

There are a few exceptions, and 11th-
year Pitt head coach]amie Dixon is one
of those outliers. V '

After replacing former head coach
Ben Howland in 2063, Dixon blew off
the “rebuilding” phase that new coach-
es undergo. Dixon guided his team to
four Big East Championship appear-
ances in his first five seasons, and he
holds the all-time NCAA Division i re-
cord for most wins after eight seasons
as a head coach.

But for new coaches in the ACC, suc-
cess hasn’t come as easily.

«Two second-year coaches, four
three-year, two four-year and a fifth-

year coach make up the ACC landscape, .

and most of their teams are clumped to-
gether at the bottom of the conference.

Dixon sees the correlation.

“I think our conference inthe ACC
will continue to get better because it
does have some coaches who are re-
building programs,” Dixon said last
week.

In this week’s edition of the ACC
Breakdown, Syracuse remains at the

 SPORTS  

top with Pitt and Duke not far behind.
After that, there’s a fierce scramble for
fourth place between six. teams.
Reminiscing on his first s_everal
seasons in the Big East, Dixon said his
teams started in similar positions. They
weren’t projected to finish as the top

_ team, but slowly climbed their way into

the top three, where they have pretty
much remained for a decade.
“I had a hard time moving up in the

league standings because there wasn’t.
areal drop at the top,” Dixon said. “If

the other teams don’t drop, there’s'no-
where to go.” ‘

Still, all 15 teams receive invitations
to the ACC Tournament. Analysts have
yet to determine if the ACC is a deep
conference or a weak one, but Dixon
advised them to remain conscious of
middle—of-the-pack teams.

“You talk about Connecticut [in
2011], where they can come in 9th place
[in the Big East] and win the league
and win a national championship, and
then you have teams like Syracuse who
are really good and then. may have a
down year and then are really good‘ the
following year afterwards,” he said.
“There’s not much difference inithese

With his arms foldedland his shoulders
huddled over the microphone, Pitt head
coach Jamie Dixon ﬂooded his news
conference with a messageafter a loss
Mondayagainst Duke. '

Dixon said some iteration of “I didn’t
get the message across” 12 times in his
nearly 11-minute news conference, harp-
ing on his inability to prepare the Pan-

thers’ defense and rebounding.

“Again,” he said, preparing report-
ers for another refrain to come from
his pulpit, “I’ve been pointing to myself
this whole time because that’s how I do
ithere.” . ‘

That is, in fact, how Dixon carries
himself. Hedishes respect and credit to
his players and opponents when it’s due
and absorbs blame after losses —— even
if he shouldn’t. ‘

But the blame shouldn’t fall on Dixon,
nor should it fall on Pif:t’s players, who
were ensnared by the stat sheets that lay
before them in their news‘ conference.
There isn’t anyone to blame. Instead,
the Panthers’ 80-65 loss to the Blue
Devils was a fate that followed a script
five years in the making a_bout.'t_wo of
the country’s finest programs and their
different paths to success.

Although the Panthers were blown

Lossto Duke shows equal playing ‘field, different typeslof talent ,

out by the end of the contest a 15-point
defeat says as much that shouldn’t belie
that this was, in fact, a contest‘. Whether
it’s a freshman or a ﬁfth-year senior
playing the role of his team’s star, tal-
ent is talent.

Look at how the game Monday — the
most-attended to date at the Petersen
Events Center —— opened, when the game

was back—and-forth. Freshman forward
Michael Young -- a four—star and ESPN’s
86th-ranked recruit and the pre-season
prize of Pitt’s 2013 class -— hit two free
throws.

Freshman forward Jabari Parker — a
five-star recruit; a headliner for one of

the most-hyped classes ever and likely ’
the future prize of whichever NBA team _

takes him with a lottery pick in June
— answered, exploding from the cor-
ner of the court to the outside of the‘
paint, launching and stealing the crowd’s
breath with a two-handed dunk.
Fifth-year senior Lamar Patterson

kind of equal players. They’re two of the
best players, and they kind of canceled
each other out. Both those kids have to
be exhausted.” _
Throughout each premier recruit-
ing class, each one—and—done freshman,

each future lottery pick and each veteran"

star‘(there have been plenty of those
too), Krzyzewski remainsthe face of the
legendary program.

With two glimmering pins on each
lapel of his sport coat and a ﬁnger to hold
one of his championship rings -- NCAA
or Olympic‘? — Krzyzewski continued
about Hood and Patterson. V

“Thank goodness we have a player
of Rod’s caliber to guard him,” he said.
“[Patterson] had a great year, a player-
of-the-year type of year, but tonight we

were able to kinda hold him down a little

“We play them again-. ‘We may not
beat them, but [i\/iohday]’ we did

pass, buried a jumper and reminded
fans that, hey, an old guy can put up
two points, too.]ust not as memorably.
Both teams got the points; they just did
it in different fashions. ‘

After dazzling his way to 16 first-half
points, Parker cooled offin the second
half, but still ﬁnished with 21 points
and 11 rebounds. Patterson, who ﬁn-
ished with 14 points on 4—of-14 shooting,
struggled throughout the remainder of
the game.

. Patterson’s sluggish outing wasn’t the
result of Parker, though. It was another"
wunclerkind in the stable of future stars
who Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski
attributed with canceling out Pitt’s top
scorer.

“‘[Patterscm isl lime tif the premier
players in the country. Rodney lHood,
a redshirt sophbmorel is a heck of a
player, too," Krzyzewski said. “So basi-
cally you had a wash there  They’re

bit, and Rodney was the main reason
for that.” ' l

T Of course, it helps to have Rasheed
Sulaimon, Amile Jefferson, Marshall
Plumlee, Quinn Cook and Tyler'Thorn—
ton, all of whom received at least a 92
grade from ESPN at the time‘ of their
commitment.

That Pitt could only momentarily
keep pace with the young Blue Devils
shouldn’t be a concern. Both teams are
packed with talent — just at different
stages of their careers —‘ and Duke
played with composure to offset Pitt’s
experience. _ .

“These guys, this is one of our young-
est teams, and so they’ve had to learn un-

der ﬁre,” Krzyzewski said Monday. “We

played very well tonight. We played with
a lot of poise tonight because [Pitt’s]
really good. We play them again. We
may not beat them, but tonight we did
because we had that poise.” I
