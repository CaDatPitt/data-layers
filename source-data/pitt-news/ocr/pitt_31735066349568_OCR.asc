for student input‘ in the collective
bargaining process in the event of
faculty unionization.

Posvar learned of the SGB
proposal for full participation in
pre-bargaining caucuses and ob-
server status at the bargaining
table at yesterday’s meeting.

“The plan sounds agreeable, but
the unions will have to agree before
observer status is granted,” Posvar
said.

Tight Pitt Budget Foreseen r

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

The legislature’s failure to
increase state taxes will keep the

University budget tight this year,

Chancellor Wesley Posvar told the
Senate Council yesterday. Posvar
was reporting on his budget
presentation to the state. legislature
last week.

A hike in the state cigarette tax
would be needed to raise the
additional funds, Posvar said. He
cited the dental clinic- and the
Medical School as the areas facing
the most severe shortages.

Posvar also said the budget

hearings were less “intense” this

year than in the past.

“I attribute this to afairly rapid
timetable (for constructing a bill).
We have a hunch the bill has
already been written,” he said.

According to some of the
feedback he is getting, Posvar said,
there should be funds available for
the dental clinic, which was facing
a cutback. _

Further, Posvar said he is hoping
for a better bill from the House. He
thinks that might lead to an

\

guarantee of student participation
in the pre-bargaining stable coun-
cils.

Spaulding said the incorporation
of student input would have to wait
for approval by the semi-autono-
mous collective bargaining coun-
cils. '

,The Pennsylvania State Educa-
tion Association told the SGB it
would be unable to act on the
proposal until after the faculty

Posvar Plans Spread  
Ot Budgetary

BY CONNIE GIEL

If the state legislature releases
an austerity budget—and it ap-
pears it will—and Pitt’s appropria-
tion is not substantially increased,
there will be an “allocation of
sacriﬁce to everyone” to minimize
a tuition hike, Chancellor Wesley
Posvar said yesterday. ‘

“Even though there is strong
feeling in these days of inﬂation
that the consumer should pay
more,” Posvar said, “that doesn’t
necessarily mean a tuition hike
should be the only imposition.”

Speaking before the Student
Affairs Advisory Committee
(SAAC), Posvar said he hopes any
possible tuition adjustments ‘will be
less severe than hardships other

sectors of the University will bear.

The Chancellor noted Pitt stu-
dents now pay half the costs of

their education. State subsidies
account for the rest.

Undergraduates are charged
$1,140 a term, or $80 a credit. The
state, in its annual appropriation,
allows Pitt to charge half that for

Pennsylvania residents.

Health Fee p p
Only Option, 
Most Agree

BY CONNIE GIEL

Only two options remain for a _ _
change in the Student Health - 
Service's funding base, student
representatives -and University
officials agree.

Only one, however, is practical,_
they say—institute a health fee for
students and do away with
University and third-party insur-
ance reimbursement.

The other option, which would
shut down the Health Service, is
being entertained only as a ,
reminder of the time pressures on
the administration to come up with
a budget that will satisfy both
students and the Chancellor.

Marc Hiller, chairman of the-
Student Health Advisory Commit-.;
tee (SHAC), accused the admini-
stration of ‘sitting on the original
proposal for ﬁnancially reviving the
Health Service. The original
proposal contained several options,
among them continued dependence
on outside insurance programs and I
University, funding. '

the AAUP may be unrealistic, but
A on .the other hand, these organiza-

tions may ﬁnd maintaining their

_ identity a struggle.

The assimilated unions (whoever
they turn out to be) will be joining
an already entrenched leadership
and philosophy in the host union,
as well as combatting their
“immigrant” status. This might
make immediate changes in priori-
ties difficult. ~

Given a survival of their internal
organization, the assimilated
unions may be transformed into
interest . groups within the host
union, lobbying for various priori-
tiesand tactics as well as control of
critical union leadership positions.

Although it doesn't add up to a

‘tcoup by any standards, the

inevitable result of lobbying within
the host union will be a new slant
on policies and procedures.
Lobbying is certainly the natural
vehicle of opinion within the union_,
but the organization behind the
lobbying effort could add extra
punch to particular views.

Some feel if the assimilated
unions can maintain themselves as
interest-groups inside the host
union, they eventually might
emerge in the long run as dominant
inﬂuences.

This view leans heavily on the
premise that most faculty won’t be
overly active in a successful union
organization so day-to-day power

will devolve into the hands of the

faculty remaining active. And
finally, the surviving interest
groups could be the most active.
All of this hinges, of course, on
the victory of a union in the runoffs,

but since any union looking for a.

victoryin that election will have to
court other union organizations, it
may be that interest-group politics
will play an important role in
faculty collective bargaining at Pitt.

In a presentation at yesterday's
Student Affairs Advisory Commit-

tee (SAAC) meeting, Hiller said.

there have been no decisions
affecting the Health Service.

The proposal was ignored, Hiller
said, and the options were reduced
to two because it’s too late in the
ﬁscal year to begin insurance
negotiations and nearly too late for
the University to declare a
commitment for health funds.

“Any decision now would have
to be made when students have
already gone home for the term,”
Hiller said. ‘V‘I don’t want students
to have to read about a health
increase on their fall invoices.”

Assistant Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs William Markus
said his ofﬁce knew this time last
year of the need for a new Student
Health funding base. “Third-party
reimbursement was initially very
good, but now spiraling costs have
put such insurance out of the reach
of most students,” Markus‘ said.
“It’s no good now.” '

Student Affairs has not engaged
in foot-dragging, Markus said. The
proposal apparently was ignored
because philosophical differences
between those in Student Health
and Student Affairs had to be
resolved ﬁrst——a complex, arduous

-tional.

Last week, Student Health
director Dr. Joanne Robinson said
she feared her proposal for a new
funding base would become’ a
“football-ticket issue.” Markus,
however, assured SAAC members
that Student Health problems
would be resolved quickly and
satisfactorily.

“We (Student Afﬁars) learned
lessons about football tickets, too,”
he said. '

Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs Alfred Moye said earlier
this month he was amazed the
Health Service can maintain high
quality with such a relatively low
budget. « -

“But increasing the coverage of
the services will also increase the
demand or usage, which means the
budget won’t be able to cover it,”
Moye said. . ‘

Robinson's proposed expansion
of the Service heavily emphasizes
preventive medicine and health
education. She said a health fee,
much like the current $12 activities
fee, could cover such an expansion
as well as make the Service
self-supporting.

Vice Chancellor for Planning and
Budget Jack Freeman said he sees
the fee now as the sole means of
keeping the Health Service opera-
‘‘It seems sound to me

process, he added.

Freeman .said he has yet to

Posvar Plans
To Minimize

Tuition and fees account for
roughly a third of the University’s
revenues. The state appropriation
for residents ,
$26,694,379 this year. Students
pay $33,557,999, according to
ﬁgures released in the Chancellor's
annual report. '

Such general subsidies are a
good investment for the state,
Posvar said. “The returns are
high, in terms of educating its
citizens and having it pay off.”

Posvar said he strongly favors
subsidies for education, which he
said should be a high priority for
the state.

Last summer, tuition went up
14%, or $140. This was in keeping
with the appropriation trend
making public education in this
state among the nation’s costliest,
Posvar said in his annual report.

“A partial alleviation for the
admittedly high cost of tuition at
Pitt is the very high percentage of
student aid awarded,” Posvar said.

The governor recommended Pitt
be given $2,960,000 in student aid
for the third straight year. Penn
State receives $1,760,000 a year.

The high aid total allows more
students to receive financial
assistance, Posvar said. More than
two-thifds of Pitt students receive
ﬁnancial aid, he noted. '

‘I :2 “There is strong pressure, both
from within and from outside this
country for the United States to
forswear not only world economic
dominance but economic leader-
ship as , well,” Dr. Marina
Whitman, a Pitt economics profes-
sor, said yesterday during one in a
series of Phi Beta Kappa lectures.
“A call for the reconstruction of the
international economic system
along symmetrical lines, in which
the United States would occupy no
special roles, enjoy no unique
privileges and take no responsibil-
ity for the viability of the system as
. ‘ hole, has been made,” she said
ffhwher talk titled ‘ “Leadership
Without Hegemony? The Role of
the United States in the World
Economy.” ‘ —

The international economic sys-
tem needs leadership, but the
United States’ role much change,
Whitman said.

American military and economic
dominance can continue effec-
tively only if it can be adapted to a
system in which countries are
making the transition from depen-
dency to partnership, she added.

Any reconstruction of the inter-
national economic system, Whit-
man said, must take into account
four developments—the end of the

_nited States’ protective umbrella
4 ,-{er the noncommunist portion of a
bipolar world, the gradual reduc-
tion in the United States’ share of
the world economy, the importance
of the’ dollar in international
transactions and increasing inter-
national interdependence.

“We are in an international
economic state of transition,”
Whitman said.

She explained the international
economic system that developed
after World War II maintained
stability until the beginning of the
1970s, when the system fell apart.

“At the very most, we are now

’ United States

beginning reconstruction,” Whit-
man said.

“A durable framework of inter-
national economic order is most
conveniently divided into, four
major areas—international trade,
international investment, the in-
ternational monetary system and
relations between developed and
less-developed countries,” she
said.

“There is a large order of
problems in these areas to
resolve.” --

She said she hopes thefe will be
a new framework of economic
relations that will consider the
mutual interests and active partici-
pation by all parties involved.

“It is tempting to avoid the
difﬁcult task of economic leader-
ship and to eschew any special
responsibility for creating and
maintaining a viable international
economic system,” Whitman said.

‘.‘But there wo'uld be significant
costs and serious danger to the
and the world
economic system’ if we took this
course of action.” S

Whitman stressed negotiations
to reconstruct the. system must
include all nations, but the United
States has the greatest challenge.

“We must ﬁnd the political will

‘to. modify our own short-term

economic interests to the require-
ments of an international economic
order which we no longer control
and in which many other partici-
pants now share power,” Whitman
said.

“This task may be. impossible,
but this nation was born of an
impossible undertaking.”

Whitman recently was appointed

to the President’s Advisory Group‘

on Contributions of Technology to
Economic Strength. She also was
invited by the U.S. Information
Agency to participate in a series of
world trade seminars throughout
India.

BY BILLHMOORE

It is no secret that the
University and the Oakland com-
munity have their differences.

The controversy in October,
1974, over the Student Union
Annex symbolized the growing
distrust Oakland residents feel for
Pitt. On the surface, they wanted
the Annex closed because it drew
“undesirables" into Oakland, but
their real fear was the University
would expand until all Oakland was
one big concrete slab.

But now, with the completion of A

the Forbes II complex behind
Hillman Library in sight, Pitt-

‘ expansion is slowing, according to

vice chancellor for Public Affairs
Bernard Kobosky. ~

“There has been in the past
great deal of hostility on the part of
a large number of people against
the University,” Kobosky ex-
plained. “Quite frankly, some-
times "for good reasons.”

But the University isn't looking
for trouble, and would rather work
with the various Oakland factions
than against them, he said.

The- problems in Oakland,

,Kobosky said, include insufficient

transportation and parking and
deteriorating buildings.

Many of the buildings through-
out Oakland, such as the Franklin
Apartments on Oakland Avenue,
are University. property. “The
University has a responsibility to
keep its own house in order,”
Kobosky said.

The plan now is to renovate most

of the Pitt-owned student housing ’

to improve, among other things,
security and appearance.

Pitt also is looking into ways of
alleviating the shortage of good
student housing in the Oakland
area. According to Kobosky, the
University does not think high-rise
dorms like the Towers would be the
answer, but is considering instead

two- or three-story town houses.

Kobosky, who said he wishes he
had more time to devote; to
promoting Oakland, proposes Uni-
versity representatives sit down
with residents, businessmen and
city planners to look ahead. "‘We
have to come up with creative
directions and ideas for the
preservation of Oakland as a
residential area.”

But the current critical need, i

Kobosky thinks, is for more and
better student housing, and the

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

Last Call for Voting

Any mention now of the unionization election’s importance would be
a terrible understatement, especially as we watch everyone——faculty,
students and administrators—get into the act during these two days.

The rnomentousness of the Pitt faculty’s decision certainly is not
being overlooked; off-campus media also are keeping close tabs on the
days’ developments.

/The outcome of the vote will make national academic news, and it’s
with this in mind that we urge all eligible faculty members to voteif
they haven’t. already. ~ '

The polls will be open until 9 p.m. today.
That faculty mailboxes have been saturated with union literature is

‘ no excuse for failure to respond at the polling booth. As a matter of

fact,’ for those aggravated with the issue, voting is the only way to end
this long-winded union campaign. V

Going into the election, there was a sizable‘ bloc of undecided voters
whose ballots, if cast in a certain direction, would produce an
immediate winner and eliminate thenecessity of a rimolf at the end of
the month. ' .

So it’s not as if one vote oouldn’t make a difference. After all, only
1,210-faculty are eligible to cast ballots in the Provost’s area.

With the profound effect unionization can have on the University,

K there are plenty of students and administrators who would be more

than glad to cast those ballots but whotnever will make it to the polls.

But because this is an issue that originated with the faculty, only they -

have this tremendous power at their disposal.

lt’s Results We Want

No student wants a tuition hike at Pitt. For those students who are
mindful of what it costs to go to school here, there's the Student
Coalition Against Tuition Hikes (SCATH). Sometimes, however, we
wonder if SCATH is for the students. - .

SCATH has to get down to brass tacks at its nextmeeting or else ﬁnd
itself as ineffective in combatting a new bike as last year’s START-UP.
' ' Paraphrased ideology and glittering generalities aimed at the Board
of Trustees are not going to make the trustees oower before SCATH.

~’Ihere is something terribly amiss in the way certain factions of the

student coalition come off in public.
There’s a strong element of political arrogance in the battlecry

* “Education is our right!” which SCATH has adopted in its statement
of purpose. Education is, of course, everyone’s right, and over the ‘

years we’ve been a strong advocate of quality education.

But failing to recognize that the money for education in an inﬂated
economy must come from somewhere is one of society's more
unforgivable naivetes. If students don’t want to pay for the increasing
cost of education—and this is understandable——they must ﬁnd
someone who will, in this case, either Pennsylvania or Pitt.

There are certain political realities  which SCATH must work,

unless it intends some sort of subversion. And at this point, that's

anyone’s guess since SCATH has done little else but talk.

Student Government Board (SGB) President Barry Weisband said at
SCATH’s last meeting that the administration said the SGB might be
permitted to see Pitt’s level-one budget, the speciﬁc breakdown of _the ,
University's ﬁnances, as long as the ﬁgures are not leaked to the
public.

Weisband's is the second SGB administration to ﬁght for a glimpse
of the level-one. Although the SGB is part of SCATH, some of the
coalition’s members were angry that the information could be shown to
seven students and not to thousands of others.

This is one of the realities through which, not against which, a
pragmatic SCATH would work. It should not be an objective of a
‘self-styled coalition to disrupt any activity or to undercut any
advantage the SGB may have in combating rising tuition.

In the ﬁnal analysis, it’s results that we want. Whether SCATH or

the SGB produces them is immaterial. ,

A Sickly-Sweet Purple Fluid

BY JOHN METCALFE

Like all the dwellers in this vale of tears, I am
occasionally struck down by weaknesses of the flesh.
When this results in no more than a triumph of the
ﬂesh, I do not let it trouble me overmuch. However,
when the ﬂesh suffers, I am distressed.“

Perhaps it is the _mad climate of Pittsburgh, where
temperatures ﬂing themselves up and down almost
at random and great quantities of snow and rain
cascade down at irregular intervals, .combined with
the‘ great effusions of exotic chemicals into our air
andwater. that make this area a threat to human
health. Perhaps it is a judgement upon us—for some
collective offense we cannot‘ even remember
committing. _

Whatever the reason, this is an unhealthy place.
Amost everyone manages to suffer an average of
three severe colds or ﬂus in the two semesters of the
regular ‘academic year, with extras added. in
proportion as they attend all or‘ part of the spring and
summer sessions. At least one of these afflictions is
likely to develop into something even more
deadIy—perhaps pneumonia, or bronchitis, or

, pleurisy. In between episodes of illness, we suffer

from sinusitis to a degree unknown elsewhere in the
world. Great medical scholars travel enormous
distances to see our remarkable incidence of what is
elsewhere a rare affliction. ‘ '

COLUMN AND A HALF

I do not consult with these great scholars,_ of
course. I have lived in many of their native lands
without suffering from the dread sinus; while they
are here to observe it in action, I cannot afford their
fees. Professors rarelv minister to me.

Instead, I minister to myself most of the time. I
absorb great numbers of patented pills every day, to
keep my sinus cavities from blinding me altogether;
even so, I get sick now and then. It is a matter of
pride with me that I do not seek aid from
professionals for a mere cold or ﬂu. I wait lintil the
mild affliction has developed into a real disease, at
which time I gasp a cry for .help' through the
telephone to a doctor.

Doctors prescribe things. It is their function. The
“Physicians Desk Reference,” better known as the
PDR, lists more than twenty-two hundred of the
things doctors may prescribe. It seems an awesome
task, the matching of an unknown number of
disorders with more than two thousand possible
remedies; it is likely to increase our respect for
physicians, however inept they ‘may otherwise
appear to be. A closer reading of the PDR, though,
reveals that the thousands of named drugs actually

. represent only about three hundred ' distinct
substances, arranged in various strengths and
combinations, and that the physicians’ armamentar-
ium consists of only a few hundred chemicals, hardly
more than that of the medieval alchemist, and
something even a high-school graduate might hope
to master after a suitable apprenticeship.

Still, I go to the doctors. Our son goes to the

respective disorders.

purple in color, which contains an antihistamine——the
same one. as it chances, that is included in my
over-the-counter sinus medication. Phenylpropanol-
amine Hydrochloride.

Meanwhile, I have my characteristic cough. A
doctor prescribes Dimetane. This is a ferocious
mixture of opiates and cough-suppressors. Can Itell

sicklv-sweet, but it is orange in color and has a rather
thick texture on the tongue. In the spoon, the
difference between the two remedies is unmistak-
able, and this is a good thing. .._.‘-\,,,V
I first learned about Dimetane from an old arm”

dear friend only a few days before the stuff was
prescribed for me. We were talking on the
telephone, and the subject of colds came up. He had
one, and I suspected that I had one brewing in the
deeper parts of my breathing apparatus. We were
both right. He had been given a prescription for
Dimetane as relief above a whisper he had
developed. These are serious handicaps for a
teacher. So he took his medicine and he taught his
evening course and he prepared to go home. Out
came the trusty bottle of Dimetane. Hardly any of us
bother to carry a teaspoon along with our" medicine
bottles when we are ill. We know we can gauge a
proper dose. And so..did my friend.

The trip home required a difﬁcult crossing of the

Allegheny river at just about the point were Geor§':§;V,

Washington fell into it, and a long drive up a narrow ‘
but fast highway. There were no real problems until '
a truck attempted to pass his little car. More speed
seemed to be the answer, but the truck prevailed. As.
a cuuscquciice of the trucks passing my friend’s
little, car, most of the mud and debris which had
‘accumulated on the narrow but fast highway was
spread over the windshield ofihis car. My friend was ‘
brave and competent. He was ‘medicated to the
degree he had thought necessary. His squirting
windshield washer had ceased to Work some years
earlier. He did the proper thing.

My dear friend, who did not die of his folly, got out
to clean his windshield. He pulled a rag from under
the driver's seat, openedithe door, andprepared to
scrape off the accumulated mud.

There must indeed be a Providence which loc.l¢;:,‘.,
after the foolish, the helpless, and the intoxicateiis;-..
Before he stepped out on the pavement, my friend
glanced at his instrument panel to see how he was
doing. He was doing sixty miles per hour. He shut
the door, sat down, and drove home peering through
his opaque windshield. It was only a_fter_he was
home and the cough syrup had. quit doing its Work
quite so well that he enjoyed a bit of fear about the
whole incident. At any rate, that is how he told it to
me. A _

Mv mischance with the same stuff was not so
dramatic. As mentioned somewhere above,
Dimetane is a ropy orange sweet liquid, while
Dimetapp is a clear purple sickly-sweet ﬂuid.
Otherwise they are identical, as both are furnished in
standard brown six-ounce bottles with pharmacist’s
labels on them. '

Dimetane. It languished in the medicine cabinet.
Near the Dimetapp.
But I am not always careful. Even, though I should

know by now just how many of my patenteﬁ5.£
antihistamines (Phenylpropanolamine Hydro-"H"

chloride) I am likely to consume in a day, or a week,
or a month. I regularly run out of them. ‘

Fear not. There is a substitute in the house, if you
can choke down the sweet purple ﬂavor. This story
could not go on ifl did not run out of pills, so I did. I
waited a couple of hours past the time when I would
normally have taken a pill, hoping first I would ﬁnd I
did not need the things at all, and, second, that
perhaps I could get martyr-credits without the
trouble of actually suffering. Alas! I needed my ﬁx,
or my histamines would rise in rebellion.

To the medicine cabinet. Of course I got the wrong _
bottle, and of course I measured my dose by the
gurgle rather than the teaspoon. I am pleased to.
report that I suffered not at all. I dozed, and I
dreamed. quite pleasantly.

    uition Hikes and    ,

BY BILL MOORE

ii!)-

Everyone can be expected to
oppose a tuition hike, but to most
students, it is just an obligatory
opposition-— nothing crucial.

Black students, however, have
reason to be particularly upset.

Any increase in tuition cuts
blue-collar family enrollment. It is
obvious more minority students
come from blue-collar families than
from the wealthier sectors.

So any increase in costs of a
college education means fewer
blacks will be able , to attend
college. That is easy to see.

-,;».Whites, both liberal and conser-

vative, seem pretty assured these
days that racism has been all but
eradicated everywhere but in South
Boston. Many -whites just can’t
understand why blacks are still

complaining after all these years.

Well, one good reason is the cost
of education. One of the messages
the socialist movement has been
trying to get across over the years
is that oppression has not been
eradicated or even mitigated, but
merely has been made harder to
ﬁnd.

~ BEHIND THE LINES

The socialists’ inflammatory
-rhetoric, steeped in boldfaced
hyperbole usually doesn’t hit the
nail on the head, but it does in this
instance.

Whether by design or by some
other wrong, blacks are denied the
tools necessary to better their lot by
being denied education. :

It is another of the vicious '
circles—blacks are too poor to

afford college degrees, and so they
remain poor.

Special scholarship programs
have helped, but they can't help
eveyone.

And they don’t.

An area with as many low-
income people of both races as
Allegheny County needs a low-cost
university. If it has none, it is
nothing short of oppression.

Tuition at Pennsylvania's state-
supported institutions is already
higher than it is in most states.
Now Gov. Milton Shapp, a
purported liberal_, tells Pitt to raise
the tuition even higher because he
doesn't have the money to help the
school keep it down. .

There's a lot of truth to the old
saying about power being with the
one who controls the purse strings.

A Letter   P

TJ/usi Two Po rties  

The manner in which official
student opinionmakers are hand-
ling the faculty union question is
mindboggling, to say the least. The
present student reaction to the
possibility of collective bargaining
at Pitt is the Moser proposal, which
would have student representatives
on the faculty and administration
negotiating committees as well as
two student observers. Anyone
who knows anything about collec-
tive bargaining realizes that
collective bargaining only works
between two parties. There has!
never been a three-party collective
bargaining arrangement in the
history of labor relations.

If the Teachers for an Indepen-
dent Faculty (TIF) and‘ the
administration has their way, the
status quo will remain and things
will probably get worse. Junior
faculty will be laid off and class
sizes will increase along with
tuition. Collective bargaining is the
only way to make the administra-
tion listen. Without it, the
administration will most assuredly
continue on its callous ways. Power
only responds to power, not to
reason. Student opinionmakers
who belittle the faculty unioniza-
tion drive are playing into the
hands of the administration wheth-
er they realize it or not. What
student in his right mind wants
things to continue on their present
course? The present administration
had not acted in good faith; they
won ’t even let the students see the

table for everyone to see. What are
they trying to hide?

There is one union that has been
particularly open to student input
and had in fact solicited student
input months ago. That union is the
Pitt Professional Untion. They also
advocate a contract in which there
will be no tuition hikes. They see
correctly that the student interests

and the faculty interests are_ in‘

many cases the same.

The Moser proposal, which the
anti-union Pitt News has held up as
a banner solution, is not feasible in
a collective bargaining situation. I
don't think that The Pitt News is in
favor of any form of collective
bargaining on campus. Yet it was
clearly reacting to the faculty
unions’ initiative and was address-
ing its reaction in the context of
collective bargining and how the
students could participate. The Pitt
News does not speak ‘for all
students (nor do I, but the
anti-union side has had more than

‘ its share of space editorially) and,

its opinions should not be taken. as
the Gospel Truth. But if the stu-
dents want to make the most out of
collective bargaining, they should
support faculty unions in general
and the Pitt Professional Union in
particular. But better still if the

students really want to insure that i .
their interests will be heeded by,

the administration, they should
form their own union,. a real
student union. If anyone doubts the
validity and effectivenss of union,
just look at the gains in wages and
improvement in conditions that
workers have experienced through

unionization. Any relationsip be-, V

tween the managers and those
managed is an adversary relation-
ship..And in an adversary
relationship the only‘- way to
safeguard your interests is to
organize.

“Hello There Honey,
Can I SeeAn ID?”

BY MAGGIE McKAY

“Mrs. Hahn, I’d like to introduce
you to my friends," a well-dressed
young man said as he signed Amos
Hall’s guest register. The petite,
grandmotherly woman sitting be-
hind the glass-enclosed security
desk looked up, broke into a
cheerful smile and said, “I hate to
trouble you men, but do you have
some sort of identification?”

. Dorothy Hahn makes it a point to
know all the students who pass in
and out of Amos Hall regularly.
“Truthfully, everyone was a blur of
faces in the beginning of the fall
term. Sometimes I think I try too
hard to remember their names, but
after a few weeks they suddenly fall
into place.” she said.

Two people step off the elevator
and into the lobby. Mrs. Hahn
shouts, “Hi honey, I'm glad to see
you and Steve together.” In a
lower tone she explains, “They
were engaged just this past term.”

She was hired by the ‘University
in_.Iuly, 1970, fully expecting the

job to be a temporary one. “I took "

the job mostly for the money,
honey, so I could help my son, who
was in grad school at the time,”
she explained as she buzzed open
the door for a resident.

When she started working at the
dormitory security desks, students
were allowed to have’ guests only
until 10 p.m., and they had to sign
themselves in and out at night. But
if the security system has changed,
the students, according to Mrs.
Hahn, have not. I

“l’ve been around long enough
to see that the students haven’t
changed, honey. Ihave to raise my

Dorothy Hahn, the desk attendant  Amos Hall, said she thinks she

voice to them sometimes, but
they’re good," she said. “It's hard
to be a student."

A resident runs out of the
building, calling over her shoulder,
“I'm going to come right back,
Mrs. Hahn.”

Mrs. Hahn feels that she and the
other women who work at the
security desks do more than just
check student IDs and watch them
go in and out. “I feel that we end
up being mothers away from home.
Sometimes it helps the students to
have a disinterested person to talk
to," she said. “One of the main
problems is homesickness. I don’t
give anyone advice because I’m not
qualified to do that, but I’ll let them
talk it out.”

As a group of students ﬂood into
the lobby, Mrs. Hahn, busily
checking IDs, said abstractedly,
“All the ladies who work the desks
love the students. There are 10 of
us and we try to get together
often—but we don’t discuss the
students on our free time.”

Although she and her husband
have conflicting work schedules,
Mrs. Hahn claims that her family is
better off when she’s working. “If
I'm working, I won’t be at home
scolding them. I always tell the
students that I'm nice to everyone
except my family,” she said.

Now that she’s been here for six
years, the mere. mention of
changing her job makes Mrs. Hahn
throw up her hands. “Oh, honey, I
wouldn’t wouldn’t want to change
my job now,” she said. “Where
else can I have such a pleasant job
and get paid for doing it? The one
thing I’m good at is talking, and I
love to talk to the students.”

Depression

BY MAGGIE McKAY

Depression is the common cold
of mental disturbances. A
recent survey , by the National
Institute of Mental Health revealed
as many as eight million people a
year suffer depression severe
enough to warrant medical atten-
tion

No group of people is immune to.

the disorder. Studies show suicide
rates among the young are rising
yearly, and an increasing number
of college students are turning to
campus counseling centers for help
indealing with depression.- Many
college counselors estimate that
about 1,000 students attempt
suicide yearly, with approximately
250 succeeding. ‘

“The student suicide rate has
apparently gone up on _many
campuses,” Dr. Robert Gallagher,
director of the University’s Coun-
seling Center, said. “But there
have been few ‘suicides that I know
of at Pitt.”

Lt..Sam Conte, Pitt’s Campus
Police statistician, has no hard
facts concerning campus suicides,
but he believes they rarely occur.
‘‘In the past few years, pressures
on the students have been
alleviated to a certain extent,” he
said.

“Suicides have been so rare that
I can only remember_one or two
attempts in the five years I've been
with the department. You never
know if someone OD’d from having

1 fun or from attempting a suicide.‘

sample, you
wouldn’t be ‘able to pick out any
one type of student who comes to
us," Gallagher said. «

“We see normal students with
normal concerns here. They are
usually at an impasse; either they
don’t want to share their problems
with friends~oritheir friends can’t
help them.” ' _

Depression, more often than not,
is. a psychological "process of
self-rejection and self-denial.
Depressed people, Gallagher said,
tend to focus on things they have
failed to accomplish. Major losses
or even minor setbacks engender
feelings of worthlessness and
incompetence. ‘

“The students who do come into
the counseling center think they’re
never going to recover, but in most
cases theydo,” Gallagher said.
“Usually themost they can say at
first is ‘I'm depressed.’ ”

“We try to keep an open door for
students,” he said, “especially
those suffering from the intense

ships.”

But if a student has suicidal
tendencies, he usually is referred
to the Student Health Center or to
the Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic for medical treatment.

A stigma still surrounds psycho-
logical counseling. Students,
according to Gallagher, fear
counseling will force that to make
unwanted changes. “I keep hoping
attitudes concerning counseling are
changing," “None of us is free
from concerns that couldn't be
helped by talking about them.
“People change only to the extent
that_ they want to change; the
counselor is merely a facilitator.”

Often students with legitimate
problems put off visiting the
counseling center because they

Gallagher said. “They feel that
they've tried everything already.”

But there is no sure cure for
depression. “You can’t rush
things by giving a lot of advice to a
depressed person and berating him
never helps either," Gallagher
said. .

Commentary

Moser’s Proposal

BY BILL KALMAN

During the past few weeks, there-
have been growing attempts to
convince students the unionization
of the Pitt faculty would be-
detrimental to our interests. Union
supporters have argued the oppos-
ite.

In the midst of this controversy,
there have been two proposals to
“ensure” student participation in
the collective bargaining process.
The ﬁrst of these, the Moser
proposal, named after its law-
student originator, was so complet-
ely unworkable that it quickly was
rejected by the contending parties.
The Pitt Professional Union (PPU)
responded by offering to solicit
actively and consider the incorpor-
ation of student proposals into its
contract demands, at the negotia-
tions with the administration. This
offer was not taken up by Student
Government.

The latest Student Government
proposal has two parts. The first
calls for student observers to be
present at all collective bargaining
sessions. This proposal, which has
some merit, should be given
consideration by the unions,_

although it is unlikely the adminis-

tration would allow such a
procedure. It is the second part of
the proposal that is the real snag.

This clause calls for a student to be
present at .all union bargaining

The PIT'I‘ NEWS welcomes lette3

tion should be typewritten and
include the writer’s name and

J

cau'cuses, before and during the
actual negotiations. In other
words, a student, possibly one
unsympathetic to unionization,
would sit in on all the union
strategy and tactics sessions. This
ridiculous plan would allow man-
agement to have possible access
(given an anti-union student
observer) to all union plans for
combatting the administration. No
responsible union organization that

_hopes to be effective would ever

agree to such a plan.

The Student Government sent
this proposal to the three compet-
ing unions and to the anti-union
Teachers for an Independent
Faculty, but not to the administra-
tion. Only the unions were asked to
reveal their bargaining tactics to
their rivals. Since the TIF favors no

union and obviously will not have a '
bargaining committee, to ask it to

consider the proposal is ludicrous.
Instead of bowing to anti-union
pressure, the Student Government

should take up the union offers of.

cooperation and mutual support.
Such cooperation has been given
already. The unions have pledged
an active ﬁght against tuition
hikes. The PPU participated in
START-UP Day last year and the
Union of Graduate Employees-PPU
is a member of the Student
Coalition Against Tuition Hikes.

The sole AFL-CIO representative
on Pitt’s Board of Trustees was the
only trustee to vote against last
year's tuition hike, and the

I AFL-CIO recently passed a resolu-

tion opposing further increases.
The union bargaining goals-
smaller classes; tenure for young,
concerned faculty members and
opposition to the current wave of
cutbacks—provided a basis for
unity with the large majority of
students. We should support the

unionization of faculty at Pitt and
work together with the unions
toward our common goals.

  

Tuition Hikes
And SCATH

The Student Coalition Against
Tuition Hikes has drafted and
approved the following statement
of purpose: .

“Once again the Pennsylvania
state legislature refuses to grant
the University of Pittsburgh ade-
quate funds. While Chancellor
Posvar has requested $68.5 million,
the House has granted only $59.9
million. Where will the 8.6 million
come from? As in the past, the
University administration will place
the financial burden on the backs of
the students, faculty, and staff.
Since I970. tuition has gone up
61%. In all likelihood, next year’s
budget will include a tuition hike,
decreased financial aid to students,
layoffs of faculty and staff, and
cutbacks in vital programs such as
black studies and women_ studies.

The rationale used by the
administration in defense of these
hikes has been that money is not
available from other sources. We
believe that money is available and
should be channeled into educa-
tional programs. Each time tuition
has been__raised it hits hardest the
minority student, the woman
student and other working class
students. These students make up
the bulk of the community.

Due to the composition of the
Board of Trustees, the final
decision-making body of the
University, it is unreasonable to
believe that the education of
students at Pitt is their number one
priority. All but a few of these
trustees are not educators, but
rather executives of multi-national
corporations. The interest of the
trustees is from the perspective of

businessmen, not of educators. We V

Letters to the Editor

believe that the University budget
is not directed toward the
education of its students. The
priorities of the budget as it stands
now lie in areas other than
educational programs. It is for this
reason that we demand release of
the level-one budget by the
administraiton. Only by allowing
public scrutiny of the level-one can
the University’s priorities be
rightfully directed toward the
education of its students.

We need to build an alliance of
students, faculty and staff who
refuse to bear the burden of the
current crisis. Such an alliance can
broaden to include those parents,
trade unions and community
organizations which support our
demands. We will direct our
attention at the administration here

on campus, because putting the ‘

pressure on the Board of Trustees
will also put pressure for us in
Harrisburg.

The Student Coalition Against
Tuition Hikes feels that all students
and organizations should and must
get involved. You or your organiza-
tions can begin by supporting the
following:

Whereas "tuition is already the
major barrier for students who
want to enter college, and

Whereas the continued attri-
tiun of staff and faculty hurts the
education of students by forcing
then into larger classes, and

Whereas allocation cutbacks
strike most heavily ﬁnancial aid
funds, special educational pro-
grams, black studies, women
studies and other important pro-
grams, _ .

Be it resolved that we demand an
immediate freeze of tuition and a
stop to all cutbacks. Education is
our right! '

We feel that all students will
identify this cause as their own.

 

and we urge you to attend our
meetings and help us in the
struggle against tuition hikes.

Posvar on Union?

Pitt Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var came out against faculty
unionization in letters mailed to
the faculty on Friday, stating “It
is my own conclusion that
faculty unionization would not
be in the best overall interests of
this University.”

)1»

Posvar said although he
supports the American labor
movement, he does not feel that
labor strategies developed in
the industrial sector are applic-
able to the university environ-
ment.

The Chancellor's letter fol-
lows closely a similar statement
by Pitt Provost Rhoten Smith.

Posvar said the excellence of
the university community de-
pends on the values of collegial- _
ity, professional standards and 
devotion to individual merit. He
also said that in the union
environment, these crucial
values give way to pressing
economic demands, a decline. in
departmental independence and
standardization.

Posvar said the University
Senate and Senate Council are
the best vehicles for faculty
influence and by attention to
these corridors of action, faculty
could achieve as much as, or
{cite than, unions could. J

ARTS  

 In Theater

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

‘ ‘Jump on top of your cues and

' be quiet backstage,” Steel/City

and director

costume listen quietly as they sit
anticipating Thursday evening,
when Stephen Foster will be ﬁlled
with an opening-night audience.

“I want you to have a lot of fun
up there,” Elvgren says.

Stephen Foster is hardly recogni-
zable; the stage is set with
phantom-like metal constructions,
and people scurry around putting
the ﬁnal touches on Pitt’s ﬁrst
mainstage attempt at documentary
theater. This dress rehearsal is
being videotaped for a presentation
on documentary theater.

Musical director Frank McCarty,
who has arranged and written
Steel/City's score, is yelling

. instructions to an assistant testing

the sound equipment.
“Hi, Frankie, how’s it going?”

I one of the show’s authors, Attilio

Favorini, asks.

“Everything is going okay,”
McCarty answers.

“Then there must be something
wrong,” Favorini responds, per-
haps because there is a lot riding
on the success of this production.
Steel/ City is the culmination of two
years of research and may be the
spark that could bring to life a

documentary theater center at Pitt. -

LAST WEEK, sitting in a
crowded ofﬁce with constantly
ringing phones and lines of people
waiting to speak to them, Steel/
City co-authors Elvgren and
Favorini.explained the genesis of
the musical. ,

 

“Steel/City is an examination of
the wedding of steel and the
growth of Pittsburgh,” Elvgren
said. “Any good play is about
universals. Steel/City is about
energy and work and where we are
now in an age of automation.”

The story is culled from primary
sources that trace 200 years of
Pittsburgh history—from its Indian
ﬁghting days through the rise of
steel and the sociopolitical effects
of its power in the city. Favorini
and Elvgren interviewed steelwork-
ers and listened to oral histories on

tendency to forget

 

Paul Rosa, Dai L. Rin and ohn Yurickin the act of rehersing

that other
people have a different brand of
intelligence and wisdom than we
are accustomed to.”

According to Elvgren, Steel/ City
does not intentionally take a
pro-management or pro-labor
stand. “We let the facts take us
wherever they would, but there’s
no question Steel/City examines

the nature of steel and human

dignity.” .
There was some initial negative

tions, but we received funds from

day and the union-organizing
struggles of the '30s.

The steel workers were excited
about the show, and one union local

Favorini explained.

“I did not expect to ﬁnd the
wisdom and the insight we
discovered in talking to the

came together in 1973 and formed
Bad Company. To call their track
record impressive since their

_, signing with'Swan Song (owned by

members of'Led Zeppelin) would
be an understatement.

Their ﬁrst two albums, Bad Co.
and Straight Shooter are both
platinum, and their current Run
With the Pack (less than two weeks
old) is already gold. Which leaves
us with one question: why the
sudden reversal from a bunch of
discontented, commercial wash-
outs to superstar status? The

answer lies in intelligent promotion _

and above all that the record
buying public is ﬁnally turning on
to basic, simple rock done without
abandoning a blues foundation.
On Run with the Pack Bad
Company stays at home and
continues to turn out lean, hard
rockers and emotional, evocative
ballads with a bare minimum of
suprisingly effective instrumenta-
tion. The lyrics are there, but the

“gut feel" of the music is what

The production of Steel/ City is '
the initial step in the creation of
what Elvgren and Favorini envision
as an educational documentary
-center. They explain that
documentary theater attempts to
clarify history. A documentary
scenarist wants the audience to
‘know the words spoken on ‘stage

the audience to know the words

were actually spoken by living

had its share. “The Great Train
Strike” of 1877 is the subject of
several engravings, showing the
burning of the Pennsylvania
Railroad depot. The depot stood on
the site of the present-day Penn
Central Station.

One of these engravings, a
lithograph entitled “The Burning
of . the Union Depot During the
Railroad Riot,” brings the dramatic
incident down to sobering human-
istic terms.

Many prints seem to be official
documents recording historical
disasters. “The Great Conﬂagra-

the devastating ﬁre of April, 1845
in the _Market Square area. '

  Vangelis Keyboard Genius  

BY TOM WASELESKI

Heaven and Hell, Vangelis.
RCA Records, LPL 1-5110

His name is Vangelis Papthana-
ssiou-Vangelis for short—and
he's liable to be the next great solo
keyboard player. His genius rests
on an amazing ability to integrate
_the classics with progressive music
even more masterfully than the
purported rock masters of genre.”

When Rick Wakeman quit Yes,
Vangelis was offered his spot at the
ivories. After rehearsing with the
group for several weeks, he left
after discovering that he and Yes
were headed in separate directions. *

It was at this time, however, that
lead singer Jon Anderson be-
friended Vangelis, leading to a
collaboration of sorts; one result of
which appears on this ablum in the
song “So Long Ago, So Clear.”

only at times; Vangelis does much
more.

He opend with the 22-minutes

undoubtably the “heaven” side of

-this concept album. Vangelis

rejects stereotypic interpretations

of his chosen topic, refusing to, .

utilize cherubic cnatos or pastoral
strings that would suggest leisure
and lolly-gagging in the clouds. "

Instead he begins with a

synthesizer dominated, jazz-influ- '

enced suite accompanied by
thunderous percussion and the
roaring English Chamber Choir.

The voices take over on the next
track with an
chant backed solely by Vangelis’
electric and acoustic keyboards.

There's a ﬁerce interplay between’ i

altos and sopranos, that is punctu-
ated with cymbalpcrashes, so much

more relevant to their communi-
ties,” Favorini said.

, The success of Steel/City could
help the theater department secure

 grants and endowments to get the
‘ center off the ground, Favorini

said. Steel/City already has

. attracted national interest from the

Smithsonian Institute in Washing-
ton.

Steel/City uses a variety of

 theatrical methods, combining

 

dramatic scenes and expressionist
theater. All the music is
historically accurate and includes
Appalachian hill music, music-hall
drinking songs and ethnic Eastern
European music.

The theme of the ethnic
communities is central to Steel/
City. Elvgren explained that the
immigrants from Ireland, Germany
and the Eastern European coun-
tries were the backbone of the steel
industry.

The show makes full use of
Pittsburgh's ethnic communities in
the music, the choreography and
the examination of the impact of

      Dawn Of Heritage Drama

the ethnic groups on Pittsburgh
political and social life.

THE REHEARSAL is a bit
hectic, with pre—opening tension.
Musicians tune banjos and guitars,
and actors practice last-minute

innovations. Steel/City’s multifa-
ceted character is evidenced in the
different combinations of cos-
tumes, music and slides, which are

_ projected above the’ stage.

. According to Elvgren and Favori-
ni, Steel/City is an attempt to let

Pittsburghers understand their

roots. a

Solid ‘Bad Company’

(Continued froriz Page 10)

“Young Blood,” “Honeychild”
and“‘Sweet Little Sister” ring of
the Stones “Stray Cat Blues,” with
Rodgers singing the role of the big,
bad bluesman in search of a soft,
sweet nubile nymph, while Ralphs
matches his advances with snaky,
whiney simple runs that kick the
songs along in one massive
celebration of horniness.

There is no denying that Bad
Company can get extremely earthy
and crude. But then they turn right
around and play tender, feeling
ballads, that are evocative and
believably real.

“Simple Man” A is- a straight
ahead ballad with crystal clear
acoustic guitar from Mick Ralphs,
and the ever-soulful crooning of
Paul Rodgers. In the_same vein
“Do Right bv Your Woman,”
“Silver, Blue, and Gold” and-

“Love Me Somebody” drip with
emotion.

On Bad Co. and Straight Shooter
there were several AM hit singles,
“Can't Get Enough” and “Bad
Company” from the former, and
“Good Lovin’ Gone Bad” and
“Feel Like Makin’ Love” from the
latter. The best bet from this

album is the title track ‘_‘Run With, _

the Pack.”

It starts out loud and fast, with
searing guitar pushing the shouted
vocals into a state of trembling
urgency, and then ﬂowing into lush
vocal and symphonic orchestrations

but it won’t_ be 1976—not with schools like Temple and Louisville on -
the schedule. Louisville may be better off bringing basketball coach
Denny Crum to coach. a He’ll have more knowledge about how to keep
Pitt from scoring 60 points, and keeping Tony Dorsett below 20 points. . 0 8

With a schedule that’s ﬁnally realistic (including the road games), ,
and with 1976 being Dorsett’s senior year, this will be Pitt’s year. But

reporters ' broke out laughing.
Majors managed only a weak grin.
He said Pitt will be a good team,

but as far as the national,

championship is concerned—that’s
a little too optimistic. Majors

doesn’t argue against his team.

being in the Top 10 or even the Top
Five though.

He faced theflock of reporters-
friends and critics—very poised, a
glow of optimism in his counten-
ance. His face was fresh and he
spoke with determination as
though not able to wait for the
upcoming season.

He spoke casually of his team to
the writers, who were jotting down
his words of ‘wisdom, listening to a
man who knows what he’s
talking about.

Majors is entering his fourth
season at Pitt. He handles himself
like the coach of a team capable of
winning. Everything ‘is business

for Majors and showing emotion‘

when he’s talking about his
business is something he just
doesn’t do.

When Cope, who is always good
for a laugh or two, jokingly asked
why the Panthers have ONLY four
All-American candidates, Majors
didn’t laugh with the reporters, but
again he remained composed,
business-like and answered the
question as if it was serious.

After he was introduced by Bill
Hillgrove, also of WTAE, Majors
played- nervously with the table-
ware and a program handed out to
the reporters. He talked of nothing
specific in the early moments of his
presentation, but was content to

Their ﬁnal goal for this season is 
to win the Eastems. It seems like a .— 
simple matter of “If A, then B.”

  

speak generally until he ‘I got: 
warmed up and gathered his a 
thoughts. ' . . .-  

After putting his left hand in a, ~ 
pocket, his right, his left again, 
then both, Majors settled down to. - T
hit upon all areas of his talented, . 
team. He spoke with his Southern 
drawl, drinking water several times, " ‘
to freshen his voice which seemed.
to crack at the mention of his
team's unlimited possibilities. 

But, even though he’s got the E 
nucleus of a national power, Majors . 
is looking for even more improve- '_ 3 
ment in an already talent-laden
squad. Even in the strong areas,-
such as kicking and the defensive
backﬁeld, he pointed out there still
is room for improvement. V

‘ ‘We have excellent receivers, so
I’d like to improve our passing
game," he said. “i’d like to have a
little better balance with our
running and passing.”

 

 

As the reporters began ques-
tioning Majors, his face lit up‘.
several times with their frequent .
quips, but the smiles were still
absent. He takes football seriously
and hopes to keep it that way if
preseason predictions for a high 
ﬁnish for the Panthers are to come __ 35:‘
true. . A

Majors is only human. He’s got 
to smile sometime and he’s got a " 
lot of reasons to be happy, but
you’ve got to admire him forhis
determination. If he puts Pitt back

in the football limelight, who cares
whether he smiles. It’s all right;

everyone else will be smiling for ‘

him.

’ 7 ‘.‘Wait until next year” is a

common quote from coaches
plagued by player injuries or other
However, these words

Coach Mike Agostinella about the

“ ~ ~Pitt track team.

, Agostinella, in his ﬁrst year as

 head coach, guided the young

Panthers to a third-place ﬁnish in
their conference’s cross country
championships and a sixth in track.

“We had a’ successful indoor
‘(we

records and are sending ﬁve

 _ ‘athletes who have good chances of

becoming All-Americans to the

 . NCAA’s. With-our basic philoso-

phy of 100% effort from everyone
and by aiming to peak later in the

’ v_ _season, the team has continued to
. show improvement.

“We had 15 personalﬁbests last

 .-week at the NCAA qualiﬁer,”

Agostinella said. “The guys are
really” enthusiastic about the
outdoor season and will have their

Wbest performances later in the

spring.”
Several freshmen have been

exceptional performers and ex-

ceeded their high-school bests.
Keith Leckenby (440-yard dash),
Kevin Carpenter (60-yard high
hurdles), Eric Descher (shotput)
and Bob Lee (three-mile run) have
lot of top collegiate
competition and been consistent in
their events throughout the season.

Setting the pace for the younger
team members were Dave Mc-
Wile, who
ﬁnished one-two in the two-mile
‘run with personal bests of 9:06.

_Mel Boyd, who ﬁnished second to

All-American Paul Stemmer in the

mile, also recorded his best time to

date (4:07). '
Nick Martin and Tom Herrmann

' ran their fastest half-miles last

weekend and are both on the

f97’7‘6'.ii"   y

distance medley relay team that is
going to the NCAA’s. Sprinter
Willie Walker and Boyd are also
members of that team. Pitt won
this event ﬁve years ago and has
the potential for a repeat perfor-
mance. I -

Karl Farmer, the Panthers’
fastest sprinter in history and
another NCAA qualiﬁer, has been
preparing for the Nationals since
his last trip in June, 1975, when he
ﬁnished ninth in the outdoor
440-yard dash. .

“The’ 600-yard dash is Karl’s

best race. He has the great natural’

speed to put him ahead of the
rest,” Agostinella said. “If
Farmer can get a good start and
stay near the lead in the home
stretch, he could possibly ﬁnish as
national champ.”

“The distance medley team also

  *Young Runners Optimistic

will have a good chance to place,”
assistant coach Tim O’Lack said.

Having a successful season and
sending a representative group to
the Nationals not only draws
respect from other colleges, but
also helps in the search for recruits.
Agostinella has several talented
high school athletes interested in
Pitt, and a winning program is
definitely an incentive to come
here. A good recruiting year tends
to produce a good team, and a good
team gets the good recruits.

The Nationals, which feature the
best in the country, will get a good
look at the Panthers and if
Agostinella’s track program con-
tinues to be successful and
improve, the Pitt team can count on
being at the outdoor NCAA’s i

“Well xxhen he left. they made
their adjustment. ‘They started
playing as a unit, and even when Al
Romano (who is being considered
for All-America status this :. n.-,on)
proved to be an excellent replace-
ment, they never let up./ Our
defense last year was excellent."

There was a theme of team unit
that has Majors playing the role of
defending one of the nation’s top
spots in the preseason polls. And
with the returning starters, 18 of
22, it really couldn’t go any other
way.

    Women's Regional at Field House A

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

Basketballs will bounce across
the court at Fitzgerald Field House
again. this week‘. Pitt is hosting the
mid-Atlantic regional contest of the
Eastern Association for Intercolle-
giate Athletics for Women tourna-
ment.

The competition should be
excellent—the entries are the top
16 teams in the East and include
Rutgers, Edinboro, Maryland, Slip-
pery Rock, Cheyney State, Federal
City and the nation’s ﬁrst-seeded
team, Immaculata College.

Immaculata will start off the
competition tomorrow at 1 p.m.
when it meets Keane.

The Pantherettes will face their
moment of truth at 3 p.m. against
eighth-seeded Cheyney for the

third time this year. There is an old
saying—the third time’s a charm-
and hopefully, it will hold true for
Pitt. A

Cheyney defeated Pitt, 47-32, in
December to win the Pitt Invita-
tional. Then, during the regular
season, Cheyney made full use of
its home-court advantage and
crushed the Pantherettes, 77-44.
Despite the past, there is a very
good chance Pitt can turn it around
tomorrow afternoon.

First, the Pantherettes will be
the home team. And remember the
Pitt squad that lost here in the
Invitational did not include forward
Mimi Senkowski, an-/integral part
of the lineup. Senkowski could

’make a big difference in Pitt’s

favor.

ALL ARE WELCOME!

Second, center Debbie Jones
consistently has given better
performances against Cheyney,
particularly in rebounding. During
the Invitational, Jones hauled down
only seven rebounds; in the game
at Cheyney, she grabbed 12.

Finally, there is the most
important reason—revenge. After
the beatings the Pantherettes have

-taken from Cheyney this year,

revenge would be especially sweet.
“We know what we have to do,”
Pitt coach Pat Wallace said. “It’s
just a matter of execution.” ,
The two top ﬁnishers in the

Eastern championship will go to.

the national tournament.

Tickets for the competition

“We won’t be starting with a
brand new offense this year," he
said. “Consequently, instead of
stressing the fundamentals com-
pletely, we’ll have a lot more time
to experiment with what we already
have.

“I'd like to open up our passing
game, so we will have conﬁdence in
it when we have to use it.”

And to top his team-strength
theme, he stunned the audience

with: “Tony Dorsett isn ’t our entire ;

offense anymore. and 1 don't want
to have to rely on himcompletely."

A slight pause. “I wouldn't want
to play without him, though.”

THREATENED

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—An
expert witness for the prosecution
told Patricia Hearst’s jurors yes-
terday he was threatened with‘
death if he testified against the.
newspaper heiress.

Dr. Joel Fort, the government’s
key witness against Miss Hearst in
its rebuttal case, blurted out the
information during cross examina-
tion by chief defense attorney F.
Lee Bailey.

Bailey had noted that Fort sent
out a press release some weeks ago
requesting anonymity in the Hearst

‘ bank robbery trial and citing his

fears of personal danger.
“You're afraid of the SLA-crazy

people in the SLA?” Bailey asked,\fr:-W

referring to the Symbionese Liber-
ation Army, the revolutionary band
which kidnaped Miss Hearst two
years ago and which she had said
she still fears.

‘.‘Mr. Bailey,” said the witness,
“I received a death threat last
week. The threat was if I testified
for the U.S. government I’d be
killed."
