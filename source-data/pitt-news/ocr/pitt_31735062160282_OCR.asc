Campus Police have contract troubles.

University's State Allocations

Talks Settle Police Contract

BY N.J.BROWN

The contract agreement reached
between the Campus Police (Local
Union No. 249) and the University
averted a possible walkout Friday,
August 31 at midnight.

Though the contract seemed
unsatisfactory to many members of
the force, according to Office
Robert Kolesky, “We signed
because we consider ourselves
policemen and professionals first.
If we had gone out on strike it
would have caused too many
hardships for the University and
the students.” I

Kolesky feels the union got
considerably less than they had

Pitt Suffers Growing Financial Crisis

BY . JHN AMSON CAPITMAN

The Univerisity is caught in a
“financial straight-jacket” said
Vice-Chancellor of Planning and
Budget, Arlon Elser, referring to
the still unapproved Common-
wealth allocations to state-related
universities.

When the Commonwealth ‘legis-
lature closed session for the
summer, bills had been passed in
both the House of Representatives
and the Senate, which would have
given the University $45,582,000
plus and incremental sum intended
for faculty and staff compensation.

The House version called for an
increment of $2,350,000 while the
Senate bill cites an increase of

$2,652,000. The discrepancy be- I

tween the two bills will have to be
ironed out
representatives from both houses
of the legislature.

The legislature, however, will not
reconvene until September 17, and

, according to sources in Harrisburg

it will be at least two weeks and
possibly a month before such a

in a committee of ..

committee is formed.

Assuming a compromise ﬁgure is
reached, the bill will be sent to
Governor Milton Shapp for appro-
val. The Governor however has
recommended the $45,582,000
ﬁgure as the maximum appropria-
tion to the University. 1

Shapp then, has three options: he’

may approve the bill, veto the bill,
or “blue-line” [change or eliminate
lines in the budget] explained
Elser.
Elser.

In the event that the Governor
vetoes or blue-lines the appro-
priations bill, . it would take a
two-thirds vote by both houses to
override his decision.

The whole process could take
anywhere from two to six months,
said Elser.

In the meantime, the University
has been forced to borrow
approximately $4.5 million from
local banks to meet payroll
expenses for July. The funds were
borrowed at over 9 1/ 2% interest,
leaving the University with costs of

$70,000 a month.

Elser explained, “We, just don’t
budget for interest payments, and
these funds have to come out of the
University operating costs.”

The Vice-Chancellor also ex-
plained that -.August, September,
and October operating costs and
payrolls could be paid from tuition

asked. The new contract calls for a
21 cents per hour pay raise which
Kolesky said is in keeping within
the federal guidelines. The
agreement also included an $80 per
year increase in uniform allowance,
the Blue Cross—Blue Shield U plan
to substantially increase coverage
over the old B plan, and an
enlarged pension plan.

According to Kolesky, who
participated in negotiations with
the University, the pension plan
was the only point of complete
satisfaction in the contract. Under
this plan the University will match
what each ofﬁcer pays into a
pension fund, up to 5% of his
salary. -

Though the ofﬁcers were asking
for higher wage increases and total

Blue Cross—Blue Shield coverage
these were no major disagreements
said Kolesky. The major sore
points which the officers lost
included a plan which would
supplement workman’s compensa-
tion, guaranteeing an officer his
salary for time lost because of
injuries in the line of duty. A trial

board system set up within the.

department and additional ofﬁcer
training, were the other two major
disappointments in the contract, he
said.

Negotiations, Kolesky feels, were
greatly hampered by a threat from
the University that they were
“considering contracting out, to an
independent security service, the
security work for the University.”
This is from an August 8, 1973
letter from Thomas 1. Cherry, Pitt
Employee Relations Coordinator,
to Richard Peluso, representative
for the police union.

“There would have been a much
easier and calmer atmosphere at
the bargaining if the University
hadn’t sent that letter,” Kolesky
insisted. “But the men ﬁgured
that the University was after their
jobs, and that they didn’t have
anything to lose. Everybody got
jumpy about every little thing.”.

Attempts to secure statements
from the four members of the
University’s side at the ‘contract
negotiations were unsuccessful.
Vice-chancellor of Operations
Joseph Dutton is out of town until
Monday, according to a secretary
in his office.

Employee Relations Coordinator
Thomas Cherry did not return the
telephone call; both Paul Popovich
and Police Superintendent Joseph
Gil declined to comment.

Marshall, New Dean otCAS Sees

Room for ‘Needed Improvements’

BY LARRY PANSINO

Dr. Robert D. Marshall, the new
Dean of the College Of Arts and
Sciences, plans to combat an
apparent lull in faculty interest in
discussions of programs, and to
support interdisciplinary programs
in the face of budget cutbacks.

“I’d like to create an atmosphere
in which continued talk about
teaching methods occurs,” said Dr;
Marshall. “Hopefully, these

Discrimination Filed Against University

Cathleen Gentilcore

Investigation into the grievance
filed last June by Cathleen
Gentilcore with the Afﬁrmative
Action Program and the Equal
Employment Opportunity Com-
mission has uncovered possible
discrimination in salaries for men
and women working in Falk
Library.

The grievance ﬁled by Gentil-
core, a Phd. candidate in Found-
ations of Education, stated she was
denied the position of evening
librarian in Falk Library because
the duties allegedly required a
male.

Implications were the security of
the library would be affected and
some personnel would be leery to
work without a male manning the
circulation desk.

Gentilcore contended these al-
legations were invalid since she
had been competently assuming
the duties at the circulation desk

one night a week. Consequently,
she filed an individual grievance
with the University federal agen-
cies along with a class action suit
with the State Employment Com-
mittee with the National Organiza-
tion of Women.

As a part of the investigation into
Gentilcore’s grievance the ex-
amination of personnel in Falk
Library revealed that men employ-
ees in the evening were receiving a
higher salary than women employ-
ees working in the mornings.

The alleged reason for this
difference in pay was the men at
night had the additional duty of
answering reference questions.

Voluntarily, the University stop-
ped this alleged discriminatory
practice by assigning the job title of
Library Associate One with a
higher salary to those employees
holding the position in questionat

discussions will be without the

tensions of a debate which so often —

accompanied our talks in the past.”

Marshall said there is danger of
indifference seeping into the
general faculty outlook on the
College’s programming.

“I believe the decline in interest
is attributable to. the energy
expended a few years ago in
revising our programs. People in
the College right now are tired of it

I all, but I expect interest to return.

It’s a cycle. Meanwhile, my office
must attempt to encourage ex-
amination of these revisions so as
to prevent an atrophy of such
thinking.”

The interdisciplinary studies
need bolstering, said the Dean,
because of their loose affiliation
with individual departments.

“In times of economic cutbacks
such as we are currently ex-
periencing at the University,
departments finance their trad-

itional instructions and subjects

and tend to cut off those
extra-departmental programs
which feed from them. Although
not invested with real power in this
matter, I will try to persuade the
departments to continue support-
ing these programs.”

Other interdepartmental work of
great interest to Dr. Marshall are
freshman seminar, alternative cur-
ricula, and the 80's courses. Much
of his time will be devoted to
helping these programs develop
and grow and to encourage work
between departments.

Additionally, his office will
supervise department program
re-evaluations. A few department
chairmen have begun to seriously
consider altering their require-
ments for majors.

“There seems to be a shift in the
force for change away from the
College as a whole and the the
individual departments,” said the
37-year-old Dean, who succeeded
Dr. Jerome Schneewind June
21,1973. “It’s analogous to the
return of interest and power in
government to the states and cities
from Washington.”

and the elimination of various other
budgeted expenditures (supplies,
equipment, travel expenses).

“The financial situation will
become quite serious if we don’t
receive the appropriation by
December” said Elser.

The University’s total operating
costs per month, he explained, are
in the range of $11 million.
Therefore without Commonwealth
assistance the University may need
to borrow up to $20 or $30 million
by_ May.

Elser added, however, that the
University has faced a similar
problem with state-funding being

late each year for the past four,

years. In 1969 no funds were

received until May.

Staff and faculty salaries, says

- Elser, will be paid— in any event.

“We have made that committment
we have taken that risk, and we will
meet the payroll,” said Elser.

The Vice-Chancellor believes
that there are difficulties in the
extant Commonwealth laws con-
cerning appropiations stressing the
necessity for ﬁscal security for the
“rational operation” of the Uni-
versity.

“Perhap’s there should be a
re-evaluation of the laws of the
Commonwealth which govern fiscal
matters and appropriations bills, so
that at the beginning of the fiscal
year the legislature continues to
work‘ diligently until all appro-
priations have been passed. This
is, in fact, the mechanism used in a
number of states! i

Admissions: Tables Turned

BY KAREN BURGIO

Only a few years ago.ithe high
school senior who wished to attend
college was often at the mercy of
the college admissions office. But
now, it is the admission offices of
many colleges and universities
across the nation that must humble
themselves to attract students to
their institutions.

This year, unlike many in recent
history, applicants and admissions
to most schools, especially the
small, liberal arts colleges, are
down. «And some schools are faced
with the cold fact that if they don’t
attract enought students next year,
they may be forced to close down.

Schools that offer specialized
ﬁelds or an impressive name have
had no problems attracting fresh-
men, nor have the state schools or
community colleges. Pitt, there-
fore, has not been hurt.

Many small, liberal arts colleges
in the area have been hit by the
lower admissions plague this year.
Peggy Donaldson, of Chatham
College noted that most of the
applicants accepted at Chatham
opted for offers by Penn State or
Pitt.

“I feel that many students don’t _

see the immediate value of the
liberal‘ arts education right now, ”
Donaldson said. Admissions at
Chatham this year were down 20% .

The current economic situation,
the end of the draft (although
Chatham was not affected by this),
and the social awareness on the
student's part that college may not
right for them have been major
concerns, she added.

Washington and Jefferson Col-
lege in Washington, Pa... ex-
perienced some drop in admissions
this year. This basically pre-med/’
pre-law college will move away
from that a bit, according to Don

Lightfoot. assistant director of
admissions.
Thiel College in Greenville,

noticed a considerable drop in
applicants to that college. Director
of admissions, John Craig, said “It
is time to look at overall admission
policies and perhaps to change the

Evidence of
In Pitt News

Fire swept through the offices of
the Pitt News in an August fire
causing $1,200 damage and in-

 juring two Campus Police officers.

Police Department officials say
all evidence indicates arson.
Sources said there is a prime
suspect although no arrests have
been made.

The, fire started in an old
bathroom the newspaper was using
for storage. An official in the
Investigative Division of Campus
Police said, “There is deﬁnitely
evidence of arson.”

“I know from my experience of
being involved with arson cases
that there were three definite

curriculum. Departments in the
college are going to have to do a
self-analysis of where they are and
where they’re going to go. We
hope it’s a freak year, and that this
is not the beginning of a downward
trend in students going to college.
But it has been in the works some
time now”, he said.

Frances Holland, director of
admissions at Point Park College,
noted another reason for fewer
admissions at her school. “Our
applicants were coming in 1/3
above normal until February, when
the economic situation at the school
was released to the press.” All
told, Point Park admitted 100 fewer
students this year than last, but
veteran enrollment at the school
has doubled in the last two years.

The situation at Allegheny
College in Meadville is somewhat
different, however. Richard Naum,
assistant director of admissions,
called the incoming freshman class
a “banner year"--50 freshman over
dorm capacity were admitted.

Naum attributes the success to
their hard work, individual ap-
proach and the “an ounce of
prevention” attitude of the ad-
missions staff. Another plus for

said.

Oakland Food

Prices

High, and Still Rising

BY RICHARD SWARTZ
The inﬂationary spiral which has butchered supermarket counter
across the nation has had a considerable impact on food prices in

Oakland

Students returning to their off-campus residences this fall will have
to contend with a whopping grocery price increase approximating 7%
over that of last March. The aggravated rise in meat and poultry prices

alone range anywhere from 11% to 50%.

The leaps and bounds over the last six months have been primarily
attributed to the law of supply and demand and to the economic

controls applied by the Nixon Administration.

Critics of the federal

government's program to arrest inflation have stamped its effects as

“calamitous. "

What is even more disconcerting is that, according to supermarket
managers here, price stabilization is nowhere in the offing. George
Dauer, manager of the Gaint Eagle food store on Atwood Street,
foresees no relief from the mounting barrage of costs.

“As far as I can see," Dauer observed. "prices are going to continue
to rise. We just upped our price on a half gallon of milk, and a third
increase in bread prices is anticipated shortly. I don’t have to tell you

w

it's the same all over.’

Dauer did indicate that sales of fish and other non—meat products
have expanded, but that such added revenues could not be expected to

alleviate the crisis.

An official with A&P Supermarkets conveyed similar pessimism,

However, there was no evidence
for his detention.

Police said to prove the suspect’s
guilt the chemical used for

Officers Denny Cavazza and

Letters to the

Pendrell Case

To The Editor, The Pitt News;

It has come as no shock to us
here in Boston and New York to
learn that Chatham College -- a
small college for predominantly
rich women in the Pittsburgh area
-- once again has chosen to adhere
to its original position and has
refused to show the courage to
restore to her appropriate academic
honor the distinguished anthropol-
ogist, Nan Pendrell.

The same right-wing reaction is
now sweeping straight across the
nation. Yet the Pendrell case

- stands out for several reasons.

It represents a classic combination
of four separate forms of univer-
sity-discrimination:1-the bias a-
gainst scholars who are open in
their stand beside the black and
poor,2- the bias against those who
uphold cle_a_r and undisguised
positions to the Left of the safe
liberal center, 3- the bias against
women, 4- the. bias against those
who are too youthful to be broken,
or too old to be afraid.

The details of the case are now
well-documented. Dr. Pendrell -- a
dedicated scholar, an extraordinary
teacher -- was hired by Chatham

College on the basis of her brilliant ,

record at a time when she had
already passed conventional retire-
ment-age. She then was suddenly
firedon the same grounds[i.e. age
beyond retirement] -once the
college learned of her strong
loyalties to oppressed people and
her catalytic impact on her pupils.

It is difficult to know what Chatham
would have done with Bertrand
Russell, Bernard Shaw or Dorothy
Day at the high point.in their own

unique careers.
. ' §

The Pendrell case, now in rocess
in the courts of Pittsburg , will
have substantial impact on the
academic climate in the nation as a
whole. If the college wins, more
teachers will be fired, silenced or
intimidated in a number of other
cases which resemble this. If Dr.
Pendrell and her dozens of close
allies and ex-students win, it will
be a ma or victo for academic
freedom the U. .

I now am joining with students
and teachers, both of Chatham
College and of other colleges in the
Eastern section of the nation, to ask
support for this intensely ethical
woman. The legal defense group
needs hard cash as fast as it can get
it. Please send what. you can-- and
with the littlest possible delay -- to
this address: Nan Pendrell
Defense Fund, Chatham College,

In struggle,

Impeachment T

Dear Editor:

Recent public opinion polls show
that a large number of Americans
feel that President Nixon should be
impeached. The primary reason
given by most is Watergate.
However his inability to control the
economy and his illegal in
operations in Southeast Asis have
also contributed to his overall
unpopularity. Furthermore, recent
disclosures regarding the murky
past of Vice-President Agnew
haven’t helped Nixon either; after
all, less than one year ago, the
public rejected George McGovern,
in part because of his ignorance of
Senator Eagleton’s past record of
hospitalization for psychiatric care.

In spite of the feelings of a large
number of Americans that im-
peachment of the Nixon-Agnew
team is in order,’ the Congress of
has only made the quietest
murmurs of impeachment, and
these only come from a handful of
the most militant representatives.
Even the Watergate hearings are
only a very mild response to the
very serious charges that have
already been made. These charges
should instead be heard by the full
Senate in an impeachment pro-
ceedin . Yet, Con ress does not
have t guts. If t e house could
be made to pass an impeachment

- motion, only then would the Senate

be forced to conduct a trial.

Why is it that the Congress is
dragging its feet when large
numbers ‘of Americans feel that
now is the time for impeachment?
The reason is that most members of
Congress are beholden to the same
financial interests that elected
Nixon-Agnew in the first place. A
check of the ﬁnancial reports of
most members of Congress would
show that their campaigns received
substantial contributions from a_
small number, of sources--in most
cases, wealthly corporate execu-
tives. From this it becomes quite
apparent why Congress is moving
so slowly. The only way to offset
this lethargy in Congress is to bring
pressure from other areas.

One of the ways that pressure
can be brought on Congress is to

Advice Without Consent

By GEORGE ZRUST

Perhaps the most unfortunate
freshman is the one who begins
college without deciding on a field
of study, and for want of something
impressive and definite to tell in-
quiring adults, takes a crack at
some science or engineering field.

Heaven should bless your
stupidity.

Fromthe experience of myself
and others, the results are predict-
able: sooner, if not later, you will
end up in what one friend calls
“the vast wastelands of the liberal
artists.” .

Your only chance to rectify you
is to wise
up fast and admit your mistake--

constituents are concerned about
the President's misdeeds, and are
keeping an eye ‘on their re-
presentatives, the House will be
forced to pass an impeachment
motion.

A very effective means by which
voters can directly convey their
sentiments to Congress is through
the exercise of the first amendment
right of petition. Recently
Congressmen Don Frazier [Demo.-
Minn.] announced that he would
vote for an impeachment motion if
it were to come up in the House.
He did this only after a local group
in Minneapolis presented him with
5000 names on petitions calling for
impeachment.

In Pittsburgh, a group called
COUP (Committee on Unelecting
the President) has been engaged in
a similar petition drive. In a few
days of circulating petitions, 3000
signitures have been gathered.
These petitions will be presented to
local Congressmen in hopes that
the Western Pennsylvania house
delegation will vote for impeach-
ment.

COUP has also scheduled two

public meetings on impeachment
on Monday, September 10 and
Sunday, September 16. The
Monday meeting is intended to
organize and further carry on the
local impeachment drive. The
Sunday meeting will be a general
discussion of the question of
impeachment. Both meetings will
be held at University and City
Ministries, 5th Ave. and Eelleﬁeld

‘ Street at 7:30 P.M.

one is going to give you the Medal
of Honor and a winner’s kiss if you
sit out Math 22 or Chemistry 11.

Chances are that the freshman
has had his first taste of registra-
tion and the resultant disappoint-
ment about “great” classes and
“top-notch” professors lost to the
“closed” list. Good for you.

Such an experience can teach
you many things if you’re willing to
learn. Like the fact that most
advisors don’t give a qualiﬁed
damn about making worthwhile
schedules for their advisees. The
concoctions of courses that some
advisors dream up are based solely
on what they think is “good” for
the prospective Biology student or
Geography major.

you’re like to end up with 15 weeks
of physical education in addition to
your intended course of study.
This is to say that you will pay the
price in running and sprinting if
you are careless enough to
schedule back-to-back classes that‘
are located in rooms on opposite
sides of the campus.

Courses cannot be “good” for
you if the cost is too great.

Anyway, few teachers and few
courses are as instructive or as
“cakey” as some students or
advisors would have you believe.
By operating on the belief that
most people have more baloney
than a butcher shop, you will force
yourself to make schedules that do
the job of education with a
minimum of personal sacrifice.

It is better not to lose sleep over
the eminent academian teaching

esteemed academian is offering a
convenient 1 p.m. class.

That reminds me of something
else.

Very many University students
do not know much of anything
about the campus world they live in
five days a week, so it is very
unwise to rely upon others for gui-
dance. .

For example, if you don’t know
where Crabtree Hall is, don’t
expect a satisfying answer from
that sleepy-eyed pinball player who
sits next to you in class.

Get your hands on a campus map
and find the building yourself. (For
your edification, look at building
number_ at _tl1_e corner of
Darragh and Fifth). If

Lastly, do not let the critics of the
campus food service convince you
that death is for the asking in the
Tuck Shop.

While I personally would not
leave home for Szabo’s offerings,
nor would predict bargain prices
from this out-of-state troop, I
honestly have not yet suffered a
case of ptomaine or trichinosis at
their hands.

The only real reason that Szabo
falls victim so often to verbal attack

is that food is as easy to criticize as _

the weather. ‘Besides, it is always a
dramatic show when a student says
“P.U.!” and dumps a hamburger
in the trash basket.

I had better stop now, though,

before I show any sympathy toward
the freshman/freshwoman.

Since you have no real reason to
believe a thing I’ve said so far, you
may not want to give any of it a
second thought.

The best you can do is find out
eventually that I was right. The
worst you can do is end up as the
standard Pitt student.

Pa. Guarantees Women
Right to Maiden Name

A woman has the right to
continue to use her given or maiden
name after marriage, and cannot
be required to change her name to
that of her spouse, according to a
ruling issued by the Attorney
General at the request of the
Pennsylvania Commission on the
Status of Women.

In particular, the ruling states
that the Motor Vehicle Bureau
cannot continue to require that a
woman change her name on
marriage on her operator's license
or motor vehicle registration.

The 0 inion, however, isconsi-
derably roader than this one issue
and states that the Pennsylvania
Equal Rights Amendment means
that the equality of women must be
an official fact.

Although there has been no legal
requirement that awoman change
her name upon marriage, social
custom over the years has led to a
situation in which the majority of
women have done so.

During its recent credit invest-

igation, the Commission received
numerous complaints from married
women who were denied the right
to use their given or maiden name
by lending institutions and retail
creditors. This has caused incon-
venience and embarrassment to
women who are known by a name
other than that of their husband.

The Attorney General’s opinion
clearly states that under the
Pennsylvania Equal Rights A-
mendment, a woman has the ri ht
to be identified as she deems it,
whether it be by her name at birth
or married name. The state may
not rationalize sex discrimination
based on efficiency.

The Commission anticipates that
this ruling will mean that in estab-
lishing charge accounts or in
obtaining credit cards, a woman
cannot be denied the right to use
her given or maiden name on the
grounds of administrative efﬁci-
ency. a reason many creditors have
cited for prohibiting such a
procedure.

9,000 Students Receive Aid

BY MONICA CIROCCO

Approximately 9,000 Pitt stu-
dents receive financial aid from
either the Pennsylvania Higher
Education Assistance Agency
(PHEAA), the University, or a
combination of both, according to
Charles Dees, director of Financial
Aid.

Dees explained that PHEAA
awards consist of up to one-half of a
student’s projected costs--to a

maximum of $1,200. The Uni-
versity’s financial aid office deter-
mines their awards based on
projected costs for commuters,
dorm residents, and out-of-state
students, which vary according to a
student’s status as dependent or
independent.

Dees noted that the office's
awards are made with state
scholarships in consideration;
however, should a change occur,

adjustments are made accordingly.
He emphasized that although the
“formulas" by which
PHEAA and the University make
their awards differ, the basic
philosophy behind them is the
same--both have established a-
mounts, based on income, that
parents are expected to contribute
toward the student’s education.
Dees stated that the aid a student
receives never exceeds the es-
timated costs of school-year ex-
penses; the maximum is full-
coverage. ‘

With the creation of the Basic
Opportunity Grant, ‘a federal
financial aid program, Dees point-
ed out that other federal aid
programs received cut-backs. The
sources have increased, but, as a
result‘, those receiving federal aid‘
were awarded a “somewhat lower
amount” than in previous years.

However, he emphasized that
more students will be able to
receive aid since the BOG will
reach a wider scope of students.

This year, due to appropriations,
the BOG is only available to
freshmen. Dees predicted that
next year it will be available to all
classes, but, again, there will
probably be cut-backs in other
federal programs. Applications for
BOG can be obtained at area post
offices. ‘

Dees emphasized that adjust-
ments of the total aid are based on
financial need.

NAN PENDRELL

The Nan Pendrell case is in the
evidentuary hearing stage of the
trial. The oral phase was
completed in July, and the written
phase has been underway with
expectations of completion some-
time‘ this fall.

Pendrell is the Chatham ‘pro-
fessor who was released by what
the college termed a “normal
retirement procedures” She has
since charged the school’s ad-
ministration with violations of her
1st, 5th, and 14th amendment
rights.

A victory in the evidentuary
hearing will move the Pendrell case
into Federal Court with a jury trial.
Pendrell said in May, that “if we
can get a jury trial, there is no
question that will win.”

In the background, last May
Students at Chatham initiated a
court action against their College,
charging the school with violation
of their property rights.

They felt that the firing of quality
educators ‘such as Dr. Pendrell
contributed to the de-valuing of
their future degrees.

Meanwhile, Chathams fall en-
rollment is ‘down and Professor
Pendrell has left the University of
Michigan to return to her native
New York City to teach at The New
School For Social Research.

SHARON JOHNSON
Dr. Sharon Johnson, assistant

professor in Pitt's School of
Medicine has won a preliminary

injuction against the University on
the issure of denied tenure, and
thus will retain her position on the
faculty.

Johnson filed suit in February,
1973 against Chancellor Posvar and
three officials in the Medical School
regarding a committee decision of
tenure denial.

The civil suit charged that the
decision to deny tenure was made
in a manner which violated the civil
Rights Act of 1964 and 1966. The

suit also charged violations of the‘

First and 14th amendments.

Acourt ruling on May 29 outlined
four important points on the ruling
of Johnson’s case.

The court found that:

1) the plantiff finds irreparable
harm, unless the defendants are
enjoined in terminating Johnson’s
employment and research grant.

2) The defendant will not suffer
undue hardship in retaining
Johnson on the faculty.

3) The plaintiff has shown
likelihood in success of her
research, and

4) The defendant should balance
all equities, resulting in equitable
relief for the plaintiff.

The court also ruled that the
defendants and all their part-
icipants in the case are enjoined
from Johnson’s activities, pending

ﬁnal ‘determination of this cause ~
’ (until final court action on the suit.)

While You W)

ere Gone

They concluded by stating that
the University cannot subject
Johnson to harrassment, coercion,
or interference, with her work,

until further order of the court.
LOST AT SEA
Professor William Capitman,
formerly of the Pitt Business School
and his two sons, one a University

   

Assistant Vice -Chancellor of
Student Affairs William Markus

student, were three of the six
passengers aboard their 28-foot
sailboat when it was reported lost
at sea August 15.

The “Sealegs III,”owned by

Capitman, was overdue on a trip’

from Chester, N.S. to Provincetown
Mass. when it was reported lost by
the Canadian Coast Guard.


rtessraari

This launched an extensive rescue
operation by the United States
Coast Guard, covering the coast of

New England with ships and
aircraft at a quoted cost of $50,000.

Rescue operations proved fruit-
less , however, because Capitman
and his crew sailed into Nantucket
Island without the emergency
assistance following three days of

.Coast Guard searching.

Capitman and his son felt

somewhat bewildered about the-

intensive search. They reported
seeing many vessels and even 21
Coast Guard boat along the way but
according to Capitman',“wc didn't

even know the search was on umii A

we heard the news on a Boston
radio station."

Apparently, the westerly winds
pushed against the boat’s west-
ward movement _which caused a
delay ofthe arrival inProvincctown.

ADD-DROP
If you want to exercise your
add-drop option, due it this term.
Next term a five dollar fee will be
attached to the add-drop option.
Joseph Dutton, Vice Chancellor of
Operations, and the Student
Government contended that many
students were abusing the old
system. Dutton said,“The Univer-
sity 0‘ must take dollars from
education just to get you (the
student) registered.” _
Dutton stressed that students

wouldn,’-.t be charged for add-drops

, as acting director.

R

that resulted from administrative
inadequacies. He cited, however,
that the dramatic increase of
add-drops [from 3,000 per term a
few years ago to 15,000 per term
last year] indicated the need for

_some kind of regulatory fee.

SG feels that the former system
was being abused by the students

and that the ﬁve dollar fee could

correct only the symptoms of the
problem and not the real causes of
add-dropping.

COUPD‘ETAT

Chancellor Posvar, visiting Kabul,
the capital of Afganistan, witness-
ed a Coup led by the minister of
Defense. Sadar Daud against the
monarchist regieme. The Chancel-
lor journeyed to Kabul to meet
some personal friends and to talk
with University students partici-
pating in Pitt's “Project Afganis-
tan”.

On Monday, July 16, Posvar and
his wife attended a government
reception. The following morning,
“unaware of the events of the night
before,” he found the streets
deserted, except for L _soldiers.
Posvar felt that the coup was a
complete surprise to the general
populus, and was relatively blood-
less. During the six days that he
stayed in Kabul, the Chancellor
was not harrassed or restricted by
anyone.

Posvar said that there was a net
feeling of gratiﬁcation. Lower
income citizens, students, and
Soviet-trained citizens were gener-

A ally happy to see the last of the old

government, in the Chancellor’s
opinion.

However, Posvar and his wife left
the city on the first plane out of the
liberated Kabul airport-

BLACK STUDIES CRISIS

Chief Fela Sowande’s appoint-
ment as chairman of the depart-
ment of Black Studies aroused a
controversy over appointment pro-I
ceedures within the University.
When Jack Daniel, the former
director, resigned he proposed that
Curtiss E. Porter, then Director of
Program Development, be instated
The faculty
vbted in favor of this, according to.
Porter, on two seperate occasions.
However, Dean ,_Ros'enberg ap-
pointed Sowande.

Porter said, “My! feeling is that
such activities on the part of the-
Dean serve to deprive the
departmental collective in the
Black Studies Department of its
human, academic, and professional
rights."

Rosenberg said,“...a chairman is

Vice-Chancellor of Student Affairs, A|f;-ed. Moye,

not selected by popularity,... it is
the Dean’s responsibility to select
an axring chairman for a depart-
ment.”

Sowande said, “I don’t think that
this is the platform to respond to
specific charges...I want to avoid
taking a position in the press...
People don't know me, but anyone
who thinks the Dean is going to
manipulate the department
through me is a fool.”

Sowanjde has been criticized by
some members of the department
who felt that his educational
philosophy was outdated and
irrelevant. ’

AP:-JINTMENTS

New faces around the University
have been the result of changes
made during the summer months.

Dr. Robert Marshall, formerly of
the English department, has
replaced Jerome Schneewind as
the Dean of CAS.

Marshall believes that the role of
CAS Dean is to act as an
“Advocate” for undergraduate
education within the University.

The 37-year old
medieval literature maintaims that
as CAS Dean he must seek
solutions to problems of the
“potentially opposing concerns” of
the College and the University.

He feels that he must also
eliminate the sense of adversary
relationships that may at times
exist between students and the
faculty. 0

Three men have shifted positions
in the Office of Student Affairs.

On March 1, , Alfred Moye,
formerly the Dean of Student
Affairs, was given the title of
Vice-Chancellor of Student Affairs.

Sisters Margie Miller and Stella
Smetanka of Pittsburgh, who were
arrested together at the steps of the-
White House on July 25.

When the two sisters arrived at
the steps that morning, Smetanka
stood on a curb and announced to
the tourists what she and Miller
were intending to do. She asked

‘them to join in prayer.

'The. pair then knelt down and
began a prayer for the people of
Cambodia. According to Sister
Miller, even before they were able
to finish the “Our Father” they
were interrupted by the Executive
Protective police.

After refusing to leave the White
House in a courageous role of
passive resistance, the two nuns
were taken away by paddy wagon
to a Washington precinct.

What makes two nuns risk
possible arrest and punishment in
order to pray on the White House
steps? -

Sister Smetanka feels she and the
American people have been be-
trayed by ‘President Nixon's poli-
cies in Cambodia, and she went to
Washington to voice her dissent.

.. only

“There is a history of our
presence in. Cambodia that goes
back more recently to the peace
treaty of January 27 when the
country signed a paper saying we
would let Laos and Cambodia take
care of their own internal affairs,”
Smetanka said.

“I went there to pray

because that is what I do.”

“Then at the end of June
Congress passed a bill saying no
more bombing in Cambodia. The
reason it continued was
because Nixon refused to stop it.
He vetoed that bill,” continued
Smetanka.

She added, “I went there to pray
because that is what I do. We
could have done it anywhere in the
White House. But the important
thing was to be, bodily, in the same
place where the decisions are
made, to do something we might
get in trouble for but to do
something we had to do.”

Sister Janet Brink, who along with
Smetanka is a member of the
Community for the ’Study » of
Creative Non—violence was arrested
on the same charges August 1 with
two Pittsburgh priests.

She commented, “I couldn’t un-

derstand why a date of August 15
had to be set. Why an immediate
end to the bombing couldn’t have
been that very day, because of the
useless destruction of lives in
Cambodia and the tearing down of
morale in this country."

Sister Miller. a teacher at Canevin
Catholic High School said she
didn’t look upon her prayer as a
protest. “I really think I prayed as
someone who was sinful, because
we are all murderers in the sense
that if that war is a crime we are
murderers.” . A

She continued,“Ithink it’s im-
portant when you look at the
legislation that says the bombing
will stop on the 15th of August you
did not see total silence as if it were
all right.”

The White House praying protests
began July 5 when four nuns from
Notre Dame were arrested. Since
that day upwards of 90 more were
held on the same charges,
including comedian Dick Gregory,
Father Daniel Berrigan and his
sister-in-law, Elizabeth McAllister.

In a round-table discussion at the

“It all reminds me of a book I read
by Camus,The Fall. The main
character had a guilt complex,‘ and
he went around all his life making
other people feel like guilty, dirty

sinners, like he was.

“So by making everyone else look
black, he could look gray,”
continued Miller. “And I think
that has been the technique with

Nixon adminstration when they are
confronted with the problems of
Watergate.“
Stella Smetanka, a young,
soft-spoken nun from the South
Side, was not hesitant to talk about
impeachment, relating an opinion
that would have been thought
radical only a few months ago.
“Personally, I don't know why
people are so hesitant about
impeachment,” she said. “Per-
hapssome kind of purging, starting,
anew, or admitting we were wrong
would be very healthy for the
country right now.”
“Maybe we would wake-up and

stop swallowing this garbage from,

Nixon. Impeachment is not a
gentle thing but it's not a violent
thing either,”Smetanka said.

Amnesty, a major concern of the
Community for the Study of
Creative Non-violence, is an issue
members Smetanka and Brink have
strong feelings for.

“Here’s Nixon lying to the
American people and propagating.

. dishonesty in his administration,

while we have people going to
Canada because they refused to
kill. Nixon is doing something
positively destructive and those
people positively did something
that wasn't destructive."they said.

Janet Brink added, “I think it
would be interesting if total
amnesty were admitted if a war is
ever started again. People would
be less inclined to participate.”

Then Sister Smetanka softly
sighed, “What a dream."

What’s A that?

“Il they gave a war and nobody

came."

Green has made sincere statements

city, concurrently employed by the
state government as well.

This situation provided these four
fortunate civil servants with two
paychecks, and after retirement,
two pensions. City and county
officials appeared to be distressed
at Green’s candid approach to this
problem and, so far, have
supressed his efforts to make this
knowledge public.

Green endeavored recently to

make a minor change on the

election ballot. The working in one
phrase of the ballot for City Council
presently reads,“Vote for 5 candi-
dates of your choice,” implying,
erroneously, that the voter must
vote for five and no less candidates
for City ‘Council. The voter
however, does have the option to
support fewer nominees whom he
knows well.

Green would like to amend this
wording to read, “Vote for up to 
candidates.” As Green says, “The
ballot as it stands is ambiguous and
even misleading. I wish they [the
Election Reform Committee] would
keep that in mind.”

As chairman of a public transit
committee, Green has made
suggestions to the Port Authority
on transit problems. A

One plan Green forwarded was to
reduce the cost of student fares on
public transportation. “Students
usually don’t have much money
and, like senior citizens, should be
given a break in cost."

Another proposition made by
Green through his committee was

far from agreeable to many city '

officials. When Green discovered
plans were being made to tear up a
railway and replace it with a bus or
skybus route, he voiced objections.
He proposed to merely update the
existing railway, “and thus save
the taxpayers’ tax.“

Other proposals by Green have
included more ballot wording
changes, a city consumer protec-
tion agency, and civil rights
legislation. But none of his ideas
has been implemented or, accord-
ing to Green, even discussed.

Perhaps one reason Green’s ideas
have failed to become reality is his
implicit faith in city ofﬁcials to
solve all of the city’s problems.

A notable exception to this faith is
his running battle with the only
female member of City Council,
Amy Ballinger.

“Somehow, I’ve got to gether
into a debate...She’s making a
farde out of City Council, but, by
going after her I’ll be branded as a
male chauvanist...I think I have her
running scared though.”

Why is this young man with such
innovative ideas a Republican?
Green explains, “When I regis-
tercd. I knew there was a basic
stigma attached. Republicans are
associated with rich fat cats and
conservativism--I don't fit either
category...but I was influenced by
their philosophy ‘the government
which governs least, governs best.’

Green clearly breaks the mold of
the stereotyped rich and conserva-
tive. Republican. He won his

Posvor: Fisco

Despite the fact that the
University has been operating
without a budget since the ﬁscal
year began July 1, Chancellor

S Wesley Posver does not feel Pitt is

in a crisis situation.

Because the State legislature has
not yeat passed appropriations for
the state-related universities, Pitt
was forced to borrow $4.5 million at
9 1/2% interest to meet their July
payroll. Slowness in Harrisburg
has been a familiar phenomenom in’

recent years, however. Posvar
noted that only one budget has
been passed on time since he
became Chancellor.

“I don’t think the delay is
necessarily bad,” Posvar added.
“It might improve our chances of
receiving more money.”

The Pennsylvania schools money
problems are indicative of a
nationwide trend,’ he continued.
“Higher education is in for a
decade of austere management.

 New Student Loan Plan

Would Lease Monies

g BY MICHEAL CLINTOFJ-

At a time when ﬁnancial aid
programs are suffering from a lack
of funds, and the University is also
in a ﬁnancial crisis, a new Student
Loan Program has been created to

expand the availability of loans for‘

college students.

The Student Loan Marketing

Association, or Sallie Mae as it has’

been nicknamed, is a government
sponsored, profit-oriented private
corporation created for the specific
purpose of channeling funds into
student loan markets.

Created by the 1972 amendment
to the Higher Education Act of
1965, Sallie Mac was established to
provide liquidity and secondary
markets for the ﬁnancial and
educational institutions who par-
ticipate in the Guaranteed Student
Loan Prograni (GSLPt.

At a press conference held
reccntl_\ in l’ittshiirgl‘i. Edward
liox. president of Sallie Mae

explaiiied that his orgaiiization was
“set up by Coiigress to ‘act as an
agency to supply an additional
source of funds for all types of
post—sccondai'_v education."

expanding their funds to further
beneﬁt students.

Fox said that his agency would
“lend money to the various
institutions, which would even-
tually be passed on to needy
students.

“If Pitt, or‘ any other instiution,
were to participate in this new
student loan program,“ Fox
continued, “the student would
apply to their particular bank or
educational institution for funds.”
Conditions for paying back the loan
will be the same as the State
Guaranty Loans.

H..l. Zoffer. Dean of the
Graduate School of Business, who
represented Pitt at the news
conference. feels ﬁnancing higher
education is the single most crucial
prohleiii at today's universities.

He said "Many students. are
cauglii in the su_uee/.e of raises in
tuition and inflation and the
availability and amount of aid."

Although Zoffer voiced a strong
need for more funds, he added that

Pitt has made “no definite
decision" whether or not to
participate in the new loan
program.

At the present time. the

University administration is still
studying the details of Sallie Mae.
before a commitment is made on
whether or not to take advantage of
the new loan program.

The construction encircling the
Student Union signals the installa-
tion of a chilled-water pipeline that
will supply the source for air-con-
ditioned comfort to the new Natural
Sciences Building and the Learning
and Research Development Center.

Jay Roling. the newly-appointed
assistant to the Vice-Chancellor of
Student Affairs, disclosed that the
pipeline. originating from an
incremental chilled-water plant
inside the Hillman Library. will
provide air-cooled relief to I a
substantial portion of theUniversity,

.“0nce the projected, central
chilled-water plant has been
constructed on the old Forbes Field
site," Roling explained,“the same
pipe system will then transport
cooled water to the cathedral.
Within three years, that huge
building will be air-conditioned.”

Roling noted. "Circunistances
were such that by the time our

$2 million ‘facility was completed.
the LRDC and the Natural Sciences
Building would liaye been without
air-conditioniiig for 2 ‘»z years."

"But now." Roling statcd.“our

inconvenience."

Oakland Shopping No Bargain

(Continued from Page 3)

which is based upon President Nixon’s July 18 announcement that
rises in agricultural costs could be passed on directly to the consumer.

“The price increases which taken place over the summer only reflect
the soaring farm costs," the source disclosed. “Retail operators have
incurred expenses, too, which come from assorbing the farmers’ added
costs without passing them on to the consumer. Store managers

. cannot include their own expenses in the price hikes because of Nixon’s

ceiling.”

The source would not speculate on the nature and timing of future
price increases.

Local restaurants have also wavered under the inﬂationary pressure.

McDonald’s Restaurants boosted their charges for meat and potato
items by 25% since last March. Another prominent Oakland dinin spot
advanced its price for a popular pancakeand egg platter by 40 cents
since last February.

The Szabo Food Service, operating the University's cafeterias, plans
no alterations in its menu. Dick Dearden, manager of the Towers
Cafeteria, asserted “The amount of meat in the menu will remain
relatively the same. ,

We are playing it close to the vest, still securing as much meat and
beef as possible, without losing our shirts,” Dearden confided. He
also intimated that students could co-operate by holding waste to a
minimum.

Bowen added that a major
component of the judicial process
are the Campus Judicial Board

composed entirely of students. The
CJB has 12 members--six of which
are graduate students and six

RHJB consists of eight members.

The CJB is the
judicial body where complaints
arising from the Student Code of
Conduct are sent. The RHJB is the
judicial body where infractions
relating to living on campus are
dealt with.

Both boards conduct hearings on
infractions of rules and the
members make judgements much
like a jury, according to Bowen. In
essence, the boards are composed
of students who judge and
discipline other students who
violate the code of conduct,
according to Bowen.

Complaints and ‘nfractions of the
Student Code of Conduct and
violations of student rights are filed
in Bowen's office at 105 S.U.*
where judicial board applications
are also available.

During the night, Daoud’s forces

Newsprint Shortage Plagues Papers

Newspapers in Pittsburgh and
the surrounding area have begun to
experience the ramiﬁcations of a
Canadian mill strike which has
prevented the transport of news-
print from Canada to the U.S.

The Beaver County Times
reported they might have to
suspend operations within two
weeks if the strike continues. The
paper has cut the number of
articles but not the quantity of
advertising.

The Greensburg Tribune Review
reports shortages and has also cut
articles but not ads. A paper
spokesman said, “We can go two

months before supplies run out.”
The situation is not immediate
for the Pittsburgh Press and
Post-gazette, according to spokes-
men at those two papers.
_ Henry Garland, production man-
ager of both papers said, “Every-
one is having trouble getting
newsprint, but it hasn’t affected
our production yet.” When asked

how much longer the paper can "

print with its present supplies
Garland said, “It“depends on the
Canadian rail strike.” There have
been no cuts in the size of either
paper yet.

According to Pitt News editor, .

Sharon Sexton, “We probably
won’t be affected by the strike; our
printer informed us several weeks

ago that he had enough newsprint

to do our job for one year.”

One newspaper, The Daily Mail
in Charleston, West Virginia, has
started printing the paper on
colored newsprint which it had in
storage. In a special section of the
paper they used pink, yellow,
green and white newsprint.

Nixon Kills hopes for
Minimum Wage Bill

Washington AP --
President Nixon vetoed a bill
Thursday to raise the federal
minimum wage to 2 an hour and
called on Congress to pass a new
and less extensive, minimum wage
bill this year.

In a veto message, Nixon said
the measure approved by Congress
“would unfortunately do far more
harm than good. It would cause
unemployment. It is inﬂationary
and it hurts those who can least
afford it."

The House scheduled a vote
Sept-. 19 on a motion to override the
veto.

The President said that fairness
and decency require that the
minimum wage rate, now at $1.60
an hour, be increased this year.

He said the bill supported by the
administration would increase the
minimum wage for most nonfarm
workers to 1.90 immediately and
then to 2.30 over the next three
years.

The bill approved by Congress
would have boosted the minimum
wage to $2.20 next July 1 and also
being seven million new workers
under the program. About 49.5
million workers are covered now.

The veto is expected-to be up
held by the House. The measure
passed there by a vote of 253 to
152, less than the required
two-thirds margin needed to reject
a veto. The margin was 62 to 28 in
the Senate.

When Nixon announced his
intention to veto. it resulted in
immediate sharp criticism from
labor leaders.

Nixon said his economic advisers
tell him that signing the bill would
have caused a signiﬁcant decline in
employment opportunities for
those effected. He again called for
a provision that would set the
minimum wage for teen-agers at a
lower level, saying this would help
increase job opportunities for the
young.

Cop Dances His Way Into Pittsburghers’ Hearts

BY DAVE MAJERNIK

Policemen, in recent years, have
not been the most popular people,
especially among college students.
But one traffic policeman has
endeared himself to Pittsburghers
of all ages and backgrounds. He is
Vic Cianca. _

Cianca, a veteran traffic cop with

23 years of service on the
Pittsburgh Police Force, has
become nationally famous for his
unorthodox style of directing
traffic.
A .“I try to always be in view of the
operators of vehicles, and I move
with the traffice. I know what the
and nobody gets
frustrated,” he explained.

Whenever someone makes a
mistake, Cianca never yells, but
makes a joke of it, perhaps playing
on his imaginary violin.

“A lot of people think I’m
showing off or putting on a show
while directing traffic. But that’s
not true, it’s a natural thing for
me," he said.

While on his corner, Cianca is
smiling, shaking the hands of male
pedestrians and youngsters as they
cross the street, and sometimes
kissing the hands of giggling
female pedestrians. The whistle is
in his mouth constantly teething,
while he frequently walks up and
down the intersection from one side
of the street to the other, deftly

“...greatest job in the world...”

sidestepping cars, buses, and
trucks by inches. Sometimes a car
stops to ask for directions which
Cianca gives quickly and plea-
santly. Most of the pedestrians
and operators are smiling.

Despite the antics, traffic on
Cianca’s corner at the intersection
of Sixth Avenue, Liberty Avenue,
and Seventh Street, one of the
busiest during the five o’clock rush
hour, moves quickly and smoothly.

“It’s all in the way you address
people," said Cianca. “A lot of
people's only contact with the
police is through a traffic cop, and
from it they form a lasting
impression of police in general."

Cianca has been featured in
articles in many professional police
magazines as well as in news-
papers and on television. Bill
Burns of KDKA-TV News origin-
ally “discovered" Cianca. After a
year on the job, thePost-Gazette
featured an article about Cianca in
its magazine section.

In 1965, Candid Camera,
dedicated a segment to Cianca and
his antics, which later won first
prize for the best segment of the
year.

Two years ago, Charles Kuralt,
in his On the Road series for CBS
New, featured Vic Cianca again for
the national television audience.

Cianca is currently appearing on a‘

Mellon Bank commercial.

The famous cop is often invited
to make guest appearances in other
cities. Recently, he directed traffic
in Johnstown, Pa. during a
celebration there.

THE ELECTRIC RADIO STATION

_p_.m. daily. Later in the evening,

The Pittsburgh Police Depart-
ment does not always approve of
Cianca’s “freelancing.”

“A few years ago," he said. “I
got a chance to make a consider-
able sum of money from a
Pittsburgh National Bank commer-
cial. In it, I was crossing a group of
pedestrians the last of which was
beautiful model. As the model
passed by, I motioned with my
hands as if I was pushing her
behind. Of course, I never touched
her, but it looked like I did from the
angle of the camera. This same
gag had been used earlier on
“Candid Camera.”

When the commercial was
completed, it had to be approved

by the Police Department which ‘

promptly banned it, accusing
Cianca of being obscene since it
looked to them as if Cianca was
goosing the model. “If I had know
the commercial was going to be
banned,” he said, “I would have
goosed her.”

Cianca was also hindered by the
Police Department from going to
New York City for a week on an
all-expense paid trip to receive the
first prize award for his Candid
Camera apperance. When pres-
sure from the news media
mounted, high police officials gave
in and told Cianca he could go. But
by then the week was half over, and
he refused.

Although Vic Cianca has many
nicknames such as “the Glove”,
and “the dancing cop", he doesn’t
like being called a pig.

“Once while I was directing
traffic by the Civic Arena before a
rock concert, I didn't see anyone I
knew to give away the free tickets I
had. Finally, I saw two kids
standing on the corner and I asked
if they wanted to see the show. I
gave them the tickets, on the
condition. that they would never call
me a pig. They agreed. As they
turned around and walked away, I
noticed that one of the boys was
wearing a jacket with a picture of a
pig wearing a policeman’s cap.”

Cianca, who has 20-20 vision and
does not wear glasses though he is
over fifty, works his regular corner
on Liberty Avenue from four to six

   

nobody gets frustrated

he can be seen at other traffic hot
spots such as the Civic Area. Three
Rivers Stadium, Heinz Hall, and
Syria Mosque when activities are
going on in these places, and at the
corner of Fifth Avenue and
Smithfield Street, near Kauf-
mann's, on shopping nights. '

One passerby described Cianca
as “a real nut,” and said that
whenever he feels depressed, he
comes to the comer and watches
Cianca direct traffic for a while to
raise his spirits.

There is a sad note to Vic
Cianca’s happy story. Despite
national recognition for his method
of directing traffic, he has never
been promoted above the rank of
patrolman and neither have his
successful methods been taught to
or used by other members of
Pittsburgh Police Department. In
spite of this. Vic Cianca maintain-
ed: “This is the greatest job in the
world, and I wouldn’t trade it for
anything."

Allman Brothers and SistersBond

BY SYLVESTER BENDER

Amidst the turmoil of a new rock
generation, the Allman Brothers
Band have finally released their
latest L.P. “Brothers and Sisters”.
It is an album which would be
supurb, regardless of the trauma
that the band has undergone, and
my expectations have been ful-
filled.

Endless eulogies have ‘been
made for Duane and Barry, so I
won't add to the list, but the new
band should be complimented for
the efforts they've put out to keep
the Allman Brothers alive in
America. Eventhough the band
lost its main ingredient, they are
maintaining a head throughout the
loss and are still as tight as ever.
The loss of Duane and Barry put
more of a spotlight on the group,
thus having more people listen to
their music. I really believe that
their deaths helped more than
hindered their popularity.

People being the way they are,
when they see a band, they want to
hear the songs'they know. You
would imagine that the Allman
Brothers, because of the untimely
deaths of Duane and Barry, would
not be able to play their old
material before a live audience, but
such is not the case--this is where
they now shine.

Dicky Betts has proven that his
guitar playing abilities almost
match Duane’s. I say almost only
because Dicky’s slide work is not
comparable to Duanes’ but I feel

that his non-slide work is as
tasteful, if not at times more
tasteful than Duane’s. Dicky

recalls: “I learned how to play
electric slide from Duane, so with
me being kind of an informal
student of his just by my
association with him, I caught on to
all he was doing. That's one reason
we might sound a little similar, but
when it comes down to it, I ain't no

never cared to be, and don’t claim
to be. Ijust play it cause it sounds
good on some of them tunes. As
far as acoustic slide goes, that's
different, I love that, ’ya know”
Pony Boy," that kind of thing. Like
in “Pony Boy," that's all acoustic,
there's not an electric instrument
in that, even the bass is an upright
acoustic.

“If you can distinguish between
the two, listen to Dicky’s solo on
“Elizabeth Reed”, “Cross to
Bear”, or “Mountain Jam” as-
compared to Duane’s. See what
you up with--your stero won’t lie.
It’s no wonder Guitar Player
Magazine voted Dickey guitarist of
the year.”

While talking with Greg Allman I
found out that "‘Dick’s been
playing slide guitar, but just kinda’
country slide. He digs people like
Jangles Rinehart, Doc Watson, and
Jimmy Rogers (the old one, not the
honeycomb'dude) and other cats
that play that kind of acoustic slide.

It seemed to me that all of a
sudden he just learned how to play
electric slide, man, that's all I can
say. We walked out on the set at
Carnegie Hall and he had two axes
with him, one tuned down to a
natural D, and I said. “What the
hell ya’ doing with two axes" and
he said something smart like I'm
gonna pick my nose with one. It’s
really amazing. Our first gig after
Duane died was Carnegie Hall and
he actually learned to play on the
way up there."

Seeing the Allman Brothers
twice over the summer convinced
me of their renewed greatness,
which I attribute a lot to Dicky
Betts. He seems to have emerged
as the new spark in the Band. He
no longer stands back of the drum

risers in the shadow of amplifiers. '

He has turned into front man and

a more versatile performer, thus
fitting in so much better with the
total evolution of the band. I could
praise Dicky Betts all night, but I
don’t want to take anything from
the rest of the band, for they
deserve as much praise. Even-
though at Watkins Glen, the
Grateful Dead’s P.A. system made
the Brothers sound distorted at
times, they still excelled. In
Pittsburgh there was no doubt
about the excellence of their
sound--the standing ovation they
received showed this.

The album, “Brothers and
Sisters”, opens with Greg All-
man's personal message to his first

 wife, “Wasted Words," a song in

which he claims that no verbal
communication is better than poor
or wasted communication. He has
his point and makes it well.

In talking with Greg Allman I
could see that he was pleased with
his solo album. “I just finished my
album, my life-long one ‘solo
album. It'll be released on October
3rd. It’s called “Laid Back” and
the only other soloist on the album
from the band is Jaimo on congas.
It's totally different from the
Allman Brothers, it's just ’lain
back.’ There's Fathead Newman
on there from the Ray Charles
Band (sax player), nineteen

Dining out in the Oakland area
can be anything from a mundane
(and somewhat starchy) experi-
ence, to an exotic adventure. At
any rate, filling your belly doesn't
necessarily have to be done in the
nearest chain eatery, whether you
want quick food or a complete
dinner.
For the dorm student. trips to
any eatery for large meals are
probably rare, due to those nasty
things they call meal contracts.
When fast food is needed many will
see those glittering gilded arches
and be drawn like ﬂies to whatever.
But you need go no further than
Bouquet and Forbes to the Original
Hot Dog shop for the best burgers
and fries in town. Try a
superburger and a large (to save
money)=shake to kill those midnight
hunger pangs. For hoagies, I've
found no place better than the Keg
Sub Shop. also on Forbes. Steak

in the mood for roast beef, sweet

in the mood for roast beef, the

A note to those of you with your
own kitchens. None of these
burger joints will measure up to
anything you can create at home,
no matter how lousey a cook you
are. Places like the ones I’ve
mentioned above are for those with
little money and no other alter-
natives. This hint could also be
taken into consideration when
thinking about eating at such
places as Cicero’s, Pancake
Kitchen or half a dozen other
restaurants I could discuss. Some
are better than others, some

The next song, “Rambin’ Man",
shines with the vocal and guitar of
Dicky Betts, who comes unto his
own on this album. The band is
just starting to let him sing (with
the exception of “Blue Sky" on Eat
A Peach). I hope that Dicky gets
the opportunity to do more lead
vocals; his voice has such a
pleasant country flavor and blends
so well with his guitar work. It’s a
shame that we can't hear more of
It.

“Jelly, Jelly" is my favorite cut
on the disc. Every member in the
band sparkles on this one,
especially Lamarr Willliams (bass)
and Chuck Leavell (piano) who
both show their versatility and
finesse, and on this cut alone
proved to me why they have been
heartily accepted by the Brothers.
Greg's vocals are quite fine, even
hauntingly so (every time I hear the
cut, he has me out looking for a
little jelly roll mytself--Lord, have
mercy!) and Dicky Betts emerges
with his flashiest and best solo on
the album.

The other side of the album is
kind of a different story for it could
be called Dicky Betts’ side. All
three cuts were written and
arranged‘ by him. “Southbound”
starts things off and when Dicky
isn't pinching out blues riffs from
his Les Paul, he's keeping the
funkiest rhythms I've ever heard
come from him.

The album ends with “Pony
Boy,” a cute acoustic tune with
Dicky Betts playing dobro and
singing lead. This could serve as a
testimony of the way Dicky has
evolved, for you best believe that if
he hadn't there would probably be
no Allman Brothers Band today.

cheaper, but they all boil down to
substandard when compared with
home-cooked food.

But there are just some dishes
you just can't whip up at home, no
matter how good a cook you are,
unless you happen to be very
Chinese, very Mid-Eastern, or very
Italian. It is within these three
ethnic groups that true delights of
Oakland restaurants lie--from the
tantalizing taste of sweet and sour
wontons, to the oily piquancy of a
raw Kibee.

The middle east has endured
itself to these tastebuds in the form
of three restaurants, but there are
five in the area. The two I haven’t
tried ars. Ali Baba’s and Omar
Kahayyam’s Located respectively
on Craig St. and Baum Blvd. As for
the three I’ve tried, it’s hard to pick
a favorite. All have had
consistently high quality, and offer
pretty much the same foods. At
each I one, however, the food is
prepared slightly differently, so
none is exactly the same.

Kahlil's is the newest of these
three, and is located on Semple St.
The prices here'are the best’I've
seen , even though they've been
raised slightly since it's opening
last year. Ba'albek's is in the same
neighborhood--Atwood St Prices
are moderate. Samreeny's shares
the same stretch of Baum Blvd as
Omar's. Again, prices are fair. So
you won't be confused by’ the
foreign terms on the menus, all
have the makeup of each dish right
under it's name.

Italian food, for some unkown
reason, doesn't fareitoo well in the
Oakland area. Much of it seems to
be watered down to the extent of
having little or no flavor. That is
why’, again,,withwthe help ‘of a few
goodies from on e of the local
ethnic markets and good cookbook,

KDKA-TV Sports Teom

Turns on Lee Arthur

BY RITA VITOLO

Lee Arthur is a college graduate,
an ex-cheerleader, and former
soap-opera and Broadway actress
who is now delivering local and
national sports news daily for
Pittsburgh KDKA television and
radio. She is the only woman in the
nation working as as weekend
sports anchorwoman, fulltime
sports reporter throughout the
week, and who has her own radio
program. _

Lee broke into broadcasting at
the I968 Olympics in Mexico City
as a “go-fer". She worked as a
researcher for sportswriters, then
for WCBS in New York. Jokingly,
she claims “if there is one thing I
can pat myself on the back for, it’s
having the foresight to start trying
to get into sports broadcasting in
1968.” And candidly, she admits
that she “particularly followed the
women's sports."

But any -tokenism on the
Eyewitness News team she shrugs
off. “The women's movement has
gone beyond the point where a
woman could be hired simply
because she is a woman. A woman

in.any field today can be cut as
easily as can any man.”

Often, sports broadcasting
seems “like a combination of a
Dow Jones average and a medical
report. You read the scores and
you talk about the players’
injuries--Franco Harris’s knee,
Nellie Brile’s back, and Brain
Watson's black eye."
Interviewing athletes present no

the obvious one. “I can’t go into

I’ve found, located on Baum Blvd.
This is Stromboli’s. The Italian
food is excellent, and tastes like it
was prepared by Italians and not
derived from a can. Prices are
moderate.

Chinese food is the favorite of
millions of all nationalities.
Pittsburgh has several Chinese
restaurants, and Oakland has been
blessed with the best of these
Chinese Restaurants. This is the
House of Chiang, right smack on
Forbes Ave, but somehow in-
conspicuous, due to the lack of a
glaring neon sign. Behing these
doors you find what I consider to be
not only the best Chinese food
offered in town, but the best food

Pillsburgh Air Gels Low

BY RITA VITOLO _

Lucky you. You are attending
college in a city whose air quality is
“among the ten worst" in the
nation, according to the Pittsburgh-
based Group Against Smog and
Pollution (GASP). Oakland alone is
the third largest trip-generator in
Pennsylvania. GASP describes it
as an area where it will someday
become necessary for “vehicular
exclusion program" to be put into
effect.

“The air pollution index is based
upon the concentrations of sulfur
dioxide and particulate matter in
readings taken at seven automatic
stations throughout the county,"
explained Pat Pelkofer, a vice-

president of GASP.

“Stationary sources and not
automobiles are actually the
biggest polluters, since the moni-
tors are only equipped to measure
sulfur dioxide. If they measured
carbon dioxide. there would be a
real cocktail to breathe down-
town."

A first stage pollution alert is
called when the air pollution index
exceeds 100. However, Howard
Weisz, an assitant head of the
county Air Pollution Control
Bureau, says that his agency will
not announce a pollution alert if
prevailing weather conditions are
not expected to last longer than 24
hours.

Roling

V “Good or poor ﬁgures is an
arbitrary matter in air quality.

Pollution levels are actually lowest
in summer and peak during the
winter. More pollution alerts are
called during the summer, how-
ever. because the pollution gets
trapped under the heavy air and
lays like a blanket over the city.”

Weisz declined to state whether
the existing pollution controls were
being violated near the University
of Pittsburgh. “Some things in the
Oakland area are not within the
law. We know it and they know
it." Which is to say, when at Pitt.

BY GEORGE ZRUST

“The college and university world
should be grateful to the University
of Pittsburgh for venturing into
such a »bold experiment. the
outcome of which will be awaited
with considerable interest."

The year was 1929 and the words
were those of Philadelphian Char-
les Z. Klauder, from his book,
College Architecture in America.
The object of Klauder’s praise was
the then-unfinished Cathedral of
Learning, which he designed.

Yet in spite of l(lauder's
understandable bias toward the
Cathedral. his description of the
building as a “bold experiment"
was certainly accurate.

The story of the Cathedral of
Learning actually began in 192]
when John G. Bowman arrived in
the Steel City to become the new
chancellor of the Univeristy of
Pittsburgh.

At the time. Pitt was $1,650,000 in
debt. with a new budget calling for
an additional $350,000 which the
University did not have, and could
not borrow. The previous year a
financial campaign raised $28,000.
but $30,000 was spend to do it.

In addition to its financial woes.
Pitt was faced with physical
problems. As it existed then. the
University was a smattering of old
buildings, some wooden. on the
hillside which is now the upper
campus. Expanding departments
and an expanding student body
were cramped in State, Pennsyl-
vania, and Thaw Halls.

Chancellor Bowman envisioned a
high tower to fulﬁll the needs of the
growing univeristy. a tower to be
located at the heart of Pittsburgh's
Civic Center. Oakland.

Oddly enough. the ideal spot
remained largely undeveloped.
On a 14-acre plot bounded by
Bigelow Boulevard and Forbes.
Fifth, and Bellefield Avenues

there were 3 houses. a truck
,garden. tennis courts, and a
swamp.

‘Frick Acres, as the land was
called, was the intended site. In
September, 1921, Pitt purchased
the Henry Clay Frick land with
money provided by Andrew W. and
Richard B. Mellon.

But such a traditional approach to
the University's problems hardly
satisﬁed Chancellor Bowman. Low
college buildings were common-
place. and did not suit the aspiring
mood of the Univeristy. The best
solution seemed to lie in combining
the inspiring medieval cathedral
with the impressive modern sky-
scraper.

At the time three American men
were prominent in the field of
Gothic architecture: Ralph A.
Cram. Bertram G. Goodhuc. and
Charles Z. Klauder. While Cram
and Hoodhue had each done
designs for Pittsburgh churches.
Klauder was famous for his college
architecture. Klauder eventually
became the man to draw the
original conception of the proposed
Tower. and ﬁnally. after many
more drawings, designed the
Cathedral as it is known today.

It is interesting to note that
something else came from the
office of architect Klauder than just
the plans for the building. The
name. “Cathedral of Learning."
was coined by an assistant. and
eventually the Pittsburgh Com-
munity adopted the label.

“Cathedral of Learning" was never

officially adopted by the Univer-
sity. and Chancellor Bowman
would have preferred the name of
the building to be simply. “The
Tower.”

Early in 1925 the campaign began

publicity from the local press, the

drive took on the usual look of

many fund-raising efforts, with one
exceptions.

Under the unique “Buy a Brick for
Pitt”drive, schoolchildren thro-
ughout Pittsburgh were asked to
earn a 10 cent donation to the
University. With the contribution,
each explained how he or she had
earned the money, and for the
effort, each received a certificate.

In June, 1925. the campaign
ended with nearly $10 million paid
or pledged.

Cathedral of Learning: A Bold Experiment

In spite of the generally positive
public reaction. though, there
remained opposition to the idea of
the tall University building.
Besides contending that the plan
was simply outlandish, people
feared that the Pitt skyscraper
would destroy Oakland's beauty.
Some said students would fall out
the windows.

Others even feared that the
Cathedral would topple from the
wind, but a later test in one of the
yet-unused elevator shafts proved
the fear to be unfounded. Even in
gale winds, there was no appre-
ciable sway. Only the sun, by
heating single sides of the
Cathedral and causing them to
expand, made the building move a
fraction of an inch.

When. on October 21, 1929. the
last rivet was driven in the steel
frame of the Cathedral of Learning,
the construction of the building was
headed for a slowdown. With the
beginning of the Depression latei
that year. necessary funds became
harder to come by.

Responsible people could not pay
on their pledges, and the Univer-
sity. fearing ill will if it pressed for
payment. continued construction
until its available funds ran out.

Late in 1930 the stonework
reached the top. However, the first
four floors remained open steel-
work, a situation which caused
people to nickname the airy base an
“owl coop." With its last money.
Pitt landscaped the construction
site with a special grass.

Despite the Depression. though.
Pitt continued to receive donations,
and after a year, construction
resumed. The stonework on the
first four floors was completed and

in 1933, the stone crown at the top
of the Cathedral was rebuilt.

The change at the top added two
floors to the Cathedral. The lower
floor, the Observation Room,
eventually became the luxuriously
furnished Babcock Room, named in
honor of the trustee famous for
North and South Parks, and
Babcock Boulevard in the North
Hills.

The upper “floor" really consists
of four turrets, one at‘each corner
of the building. While one of these
turrets is a stairwell, the remaining
three enclose small rooms. One of
these rooms, formerly equipped by
Westinghouse Electric for re-
search, recorded the largest known
bolt of lightning when it struck the
Cathedral and knocked out the
room's panel adjustments.

By 1936 the Cathedral of Learning
was substantially complete, al-
though it was not until the

following year that the 60-foot high P

Commons Room was finished.
While the first Nationality Room
committee met‘ in 1925, it was not
until 1938 that the first five rooms
were dedicated. The German,
Hungarian, Russian, Scottish, and
Swedish Rooms became the origin-
al members in the set which was
only completed in19S7 with the
Irish Room. The construction of
some classrooms. like the Greek
and Italian Rooms, was slowed by
the difficulties in getting artisans
and materials out of Eruope in
World War II.
The War had a more direct
influence on the Cathedral in the
form of ASTP--Army Specialist
Training Program. Three to four
thousand men took over most of the

Our Purpose -Service

The Book Center is owned and operated by'the University of Pittsburgh.
The primary chailenge facing the Book Center today is one of extending

service to the students of the University, its many departments, faculty,
staff and alumni.

Organizational Structure

The Book Center is a departmental operation. Merchandise or services
offered are catagorized into four given areas or departments. These are
textbooks new and used, trade, supplies and sundries. All buying for these
areas is premised on three basic principles. First the item must be required
for a given course or program of the University. Items of this type are
naturally the textbooks, used books, and paperbacks. Second, trade depart-
ment items are made available that are necessary to supplement and com-
plement the course study and to enhance the cultural and academic signifi-
cance of the University. Third, supply department on the lower floor has
supply items for your every need, paper, notebooks, typewriters, and hun-
dreds of other items. Fourth, sundries department has all the professional
items, engineering supplies, art supplies, records, pens and pencils and the
availability of many items extremely professional.

Newly published BOOKS OF GENERAL INTEREST, both hard cover and

ART COLLECTION

To the right of the entrance is an area devoted to the
Fine Arts. This section carries reproductions of paint-
ings and other art prints, and reproductions of sculp-
ture and related art objects. The walls here and else-
where in the Book Center enable a generous display
of prints.

TEXTBOOKS AND SUPPLIES

The Textbook Department is located on lower
tloor. The books are shelved as in stocks of a
library. Here, however, the arrangement of
books is based upon the school and depart-
mental divisions of the University. Supply items
for your every need: paper, notebooks, type-

Program Started for

Children's Theatre

’ The Theatre Arts Division at the

University of Pittsburgh has

announced the formation of a new
ro ram in Creative Dramatics and
hi dren's Theatre.

The program. which will be
introduced during this year’s fall
term will be divided into three
parts. Phase I of the program is a
course in Dreative Dramatics to be
offered on Monday evenings
through Pitt’s School of General.
Studies. The course is open to both
undergraduate students and in-
service teachers who are interested
in studying_ the fundamental
philoso hy and techniques of
children s drama. The instructor
and the students will work with a
group of children on story
dramatization, improvisation,_pan-

-tomine and sensory perception.

The course will be taught by Karlie

Roth, a former Penn State faculty
member who also directed last
ysafs Pitt production of Where the

ild Thin s Are, which toured
area schoo s last winter.

In the second phase of the
program, the students and their
instructor will mount a production
which will be presented to
audiences in schools throughout
the area. Phase III will involve the
placing of creative dramatic advi-
sors in selected area schools to
work with teachers and their pupils
on creative dramatic techniques.

Dr. Gillett Elvgren will be in
charge of the tour. Elvgren’s
original play, Kiss Me, Fro ,will be

one of the plays to go ‘on the
road.” All 0 the plays taken into
the schools will involve the actual
participation of children in the
drama.

After directing

Mazursky Not in Full “Blume"

BY JESS BRAILLER

After viewing Blume in Love, I
find myself most impressed with
the theater's air conditioning. In
addition, the ushers were efficient.
and the refreshment stand cashier
squeaked a pleasant “thank-you.“
I believe I would have thanked her
if she had poisoned my Ju.IuBees.
Yeah, that is how bad of a movie I
believe Blume in Love is.

The movie concerns a divorced
divorce lawyer. Blume. and his
efforts to get things back together
with his ex-wife. It demands quite
an effort, too. for his hateful
ex-wife is unbelievably bitter
toward Blume.

The movie was produced, direct-'

ed, and written by Paul Mazursky.
This guy’s a three time loser. As
producer he should be embar-
rassed, as director he should be
ashamed, and as a writer, I hope

his pgr§_il__point breaks.

There is very little consistency in
the story and in the characters.
There were moments when the
story simply jumped. as if
somebody had ripped out several
pages of the script. The characters
were ridiculously inconsistent for
we kept seeing the same faces on
the screen, but different people.
The characters are not developing
within the story. By the end of the
film_ each of their emotions.
reactions. and thoughts becomes
unjustiﬁed and unreal for we have
no strong character to base our

impressions on.

I sincerely believe that this is not
the fault of the acting but of the
writing. George Segal as Blume,

and Susan Anspach as the ex-Mrs. _

Blume, _both make superb efforts to
play a character who has not been
fully developed by the writer. Kris

Kristofferson as the ex-Mrs.
Blume’s hippie[?) boyfriend does a
commendable job. How much of
this is the -real Kristofferson and
how much is acting may be
questionable, but who cares, for
there’s the character and Kris-
tofferson is perfect.

Kristofferson's part is of import- --'-
ancc to the story but why is Shelly t

Winters playing a Shelly Winters-
type client of Blume’s‘? I pay three
dollars to see a two hour production
and they use ten minutes of it on

Shelly Winters doing’ nothing to‘

contribute to nothing.

As director. Mazursky could not
make the scenes come off. The
expected touching and sensitive
scenes came off as clumsy and
corny. The audience watches
excellent actors stuck with pathetic
lines and then stuck with a director
who could not get them out of the
situation.

THE PITT NEWS STAFF welcomes all Freshmen to an
OPEN HOUSE at our Offices on the 4th Floor of the Student Union.

TIME: THURSDAY, JUNE 21 — 10:30 a.m. to 12 N-oon

There will be Refreshments and some good conversation. Why
not come up and give us a chance? Who knows? It iust could

..r,,{;,

When I think of all of the hours
that l’ve spent in front of the
television set, I am sometimes
amazed at the unbelievable amount
of time wasted watching Perry
Mason re-runs, doctor shows, and
situation comedies.

My youth was ﬁlled with such
things as imaginary trips to
Mayberry and fantasies of being
Fred MacMurray's fourth son.
After years of being plagued by
the sometimes boring repeats of
network television programming
and endless hours in front of the
“box,” I happily discovered the
Public Broadcasting System[PBS].

In 1952, the FCC set aside
channels for educational usage.
Several stations opened around the
country, among them" WQED
Channel 13 in Pittsburgh. It is
regarded as one of the prototypes

of educational television. ‘
Although public television has

always suffered financial woes and
internal conflicts, the PBS mana-
ged to grow throughout the country
and now boasts of 237 stations
nationwide.

WQED not only runs a Commun-
ity-oriented television station, but
operates an FM radio station. and
Renaissance Pittsburgh, the city’s
leading cultural magazine.

This month, WQED begins its
19th season of Public Broadcasting. 0

Not only will its regular
programming be continued, but
new and innovative programs are
also being planned.

Viewers of the PBS are familiar
with the regular programming such
as newsroom, a public affairs
program, silent film festivals,
David Susskind, filmed conccerts
and operas, Sesame Street, and
The Electric Company.

These programs will be continued
this season, along with several

planned specials. One of these
includes live hearings on the City
Government Study Commission's
draft proposal for local govern-
ment.

Others planned are a 13-part
series on the reorganization plan
for the Pittsburgh Public Schools
and a series entit|edThe Killers,
which deals with the five most
deadly medical conditions in the
United States.

Masterpiece Theatre and Black
Horizons will also return with new
drama and public affairs program-
ming.

Due to the financial pressures of
the Depression, it was only after
World War II and the departure of
the ASTP that the interior of the
Cathedral of Learning was com-
pleted. Up until this time the
majority of rooms had walls of raw
masonry and terra cotta. And even
today, Room 1217 in the western
wing of the Cathedral has
unplastered walls. In addition, the
Cathedral originally planned to be
52 stories tall, was abbreviated to a
height of 42 stories.

The Cathedral was designed
“from the outside in," with
distinctive looks taking precedence
over function. One colleague of
architect Frank Lloyd Wright was
surprised that the Cathedral even
had any useable space inside.

But not all opinions of the building
are quite so low. The Cathedral’s
central location still makes its
classroom and office space popular,
although the building’s lack of

From its conception. Public
Television has always asked for
community support in all aspects of
its communications.

Both this week and next, WQED
has scheduled a festival of
concerts, dramas, and movies as
special programming for viewers of
Channel 13.

The “Best of 13" Festival is in
progress’ with the hopes of
attracting new members and
contributors as its viewing audi-
ence.

Accordint to Margie Moeller,

air-conditioning lessens its appeal
for some people.

' More importantly, it is no mere

opinion that the Cathedral, for its
age, remains in good physical
conditions. Many newer, less
substantial structures already show
signs of deterioration that are not
yet exhibited on the Tower, despite
its many years of constant usage
and changing weather.

With its “skyscraper Gothic"
known the world over, the Tower is
the unique centerpiece for, and

Learning was indeed a “bold

BY M.C. PILECKI

(DPPA) When the humdrum of
the dorms gets you down, or you
feel that if you stare into one more
pinball machine you’ll tilt, then try
the traditional, all-American es-
cape--go the movies!

Pittsburghers enjoy the services
of a large number of movie
theaters, including a number of
first-run houses with the most
recent releases. Of these, seven
are in the immeadiate downtown
district, with others easily access-
ible by bus, car or thumb.

Ashort walk from the Duquesne
Bluff is the Chatham Cienema with
entrances on Fifth Ave. and from
the garage in Chatham Center.
Pittsburgh’s newest hovie house,
the Chatham has had the best

record with such recent block-~

busters as The French Connection,
A Clockwork Orange et al.

A bit farther down Fifth Ave.
below Smithfield St. is the Warner
Theatre, which boasts a wide,
curved screen (largest in the area)
to complement such hits as The
Godfather and Jesus Christ Super-
star. The Stanley Theatre, on
Seventh St. between Liberty and
Penn, has the city’s largest seating
capacity and has featured the
so-called “black film” and occa-
sional rock concerts recently.

Pittsburgh's version of a “thea-
ter district" is along Sixth St.
Bridge. Four Associated Theaters,

« the Gateway, Fulton, Fulton-Mini

and Fiesta are clustered in this area
below Liberty Ave.

The former two theaters are old
standbys in the area, but both have
been modernized for full comfort.

The other two houses are relatively
new. The Fulton-Mini ’ attached to"

I the Fulton) is the area’s smallest

“legit” theater, and features top
films with low mass appeal, such as
Sounder and Black Girl, as well as
soft-core porno and re-releases.
All four theaters offer free parking
parking evenings and Sundays, in
conjunction with nearby garages.

Female film fans get an added
break Wednesday afternoons at
most downtown theaters (except
for special films). At the Ladies’
Day matinees, women pay $1
(usually) until 5 p.m.

Not all the first-run houses are
downtown. The Kings’ Court
Theater is on Forbes Ave. in
Oakland.

A bit further down the road
(going down Fifth, actually), or
taking a “70s” bus is Shadyside,
-home of the Shadyside Theater on
Walnut St. The Shadyside is what
one might call an “art theater,”
and is one of the few places left to
see good foreign (and domestic)
“art" films. Parking is usually
available on the streets or (more
frequently) in the municipal lot.

Squirrel Hill (up Forbes Ave.
from Oakland) boasts four first-run
houses. On Forbes (by Shady
Ave.) is the Forum, which
generally offers the same feature
as the first-run Encore in Mt.
Lebanon.

Going down Murray Ave., the
first theater encountered is the
Manor (at Darlington Rd.) which
has shown only three films the last
two years, namely Fiddler On The
Roof, Man of La Mancha and now
Last Tango in Paris. Commen-

surate with its box office power, are
its prices.

A block past the Manor is the
Guild Theater. In the past it has
been a top “art house" with some
daring features, but more often it is
showing goldern oldie ﬂicks of high
caliber in doub_le bills, as well as
midnight showings on Saturdays.

At the bottom of the Murray hill,
actually on Forward Ave. is the
Squirrel Hill Theatre, which, alone
of the non-downtown first-run
houses, sometimes has the
“Ladies’ Day special.

On a “good” night for theater-
going in Squirrel Hill, parking is
rough, and it is; advisable to leave
with sufficient time to search the
one-way streets for parking. Or,
take one of the “6l” buses or the
67H Squirrel Hill express bus (ﬁve
cents extra). .

If you want to see a first-run
flick, expect to pay first-run prices
of at least $2.50, usually more. If
you can't afford that, there are
several “neighborhood” theaters
nearby. In Oakland, the Strand (on
Forbes Ave., between Meyran and
Atwood) usually has double fea-
tures for about two bucks, or one
buck if you can make it to a matinee
before 2 p.m.

The Regent Theater in East
Liberty on Peni'v‘Ave. in the mall,
runs on the same policy (the “early
bird matinee” may/not be in effect
for every ﬂick). Nearby is the
Sheridan Square Theatre, which
also features double bills for cheap.

Also is usually has the “Ladies’
Day Matinee” bit on Tuesdays.
There are several municipal park-
ing lots in East Liberty, or you can

\

  
 
  
    

take the 73, 75 or 82 Lincoln Buses.

If you want to be more
adventurous and go across the
Monongahela, there are more
cheapies. In Dormont are the
South Hills Theatre, West Liberty
Ave. and the Hollywood Theatre,
on Potomac. Both often have
double features and the South Hills
(with the largest screen outside
downtown) sometimes has student
specials.

To reach Dormont, go through
the Liberty Tunnels and just take
West Liberty Ave. until you're
there, about a mile past the tubes.
Parking is on the street. Bus
travelers can take the 41B or C or
the 42/38 streetcar (an experience
invitself). Catch PAT on Smithfield

- St. downtown.

Also fairly close is the Mt. Oliver
Theatre, in Mt. Oliver on Browns-
ville Road. Take the Armstrong
Tunnels (under the Bluff), over the
Tenth Street Bridge, left on
Carson, and right onto 18th Street,
which turns itself into Brownsville
after a while. Or take the 51C
Carrick bus from town.

Another good cheapie, for
students, is the Film Festival at the
Pittsburgh Playhouse on Craft Ave.
in Oakland. Admission is $1.50
with ID. Films are shown in three
or four day runs, and have two
showings daily. Schedules are
available at the Playhours or
(sometimes)on campus. Watch for

The area colleges usually have
film programs for around a dollar
admission. Be warned, though,
that the sound systems may not be
great. Carnegie-Mellon sometimes
offers a “pass” deal for a discount.

Check at their student, center,
Skibo Hall.

A number of organizations at Pitt
show a variety of ﬁlms, with price
ranges of free to 50 cents several
times a week. Most films are
shown in David Lawrence Hall (on

Forbes across from the Student

Union), which features a wide
screen and a new sound system‘;
Recent flicks, such as Slaughter-
house Five, Sounder, and many
others, as well as some good “art”
films are on the schedule. '

At all the schools student ID’s
may be required for admission, so
borrow a friend’s if necessary.

The best cheapie of all is the
freebie, which is what the Carnegie
Institute offers. Every Sunday
night films are shown in the
Lecture Hall (behind the main
library).

Schedules are available at the
Carnegie Library, listing the
“classics" shown for free and

others for a slight admission price a

during the week. The Carnegie
branch library in East Liberty also
has free flicks--of the general
appeal variety--occasionally.

A Multitude of Filmsiior the Fall

BY DAVE MAJERNIK

“Good gvening and welcome to
the Franklin Pangborn Film Club's
presentation of..."

Wit these words by Pat O'Brien

many of us veteran campus ﬁlm
watchers were greeted at Thursday
and Saturday evening ﬁlm show-
ings.
Pat O’Brien is just one of many
people who have helped to promote
campus film programs. The
beginning of increased film activity
at Pitt was in January, 1971 when
the Franklin Pangborn Film Club
was born.

The founder and ﬁrst president
of the ﬁlm club was O'Brien. a disc
jockey turned English student.

Charles Braverman, ﬁlm club

" member described the ﬁlm pro-

grams: “On Thursday nights we
present a less popular ﬁlm of
international acclaim. Its critical
success is looked at more than its
box office appeal. Usually we
spotlight the ﬁlms of famous
directors like Bergman, Fellini and
Truffaut.

“But on Saturday evenings,” he
continued, “we offer current,
popular films with entertainment in
mind..’’

Union or look for the membership
forms in the September issues of
Pitt News.

Another active member of the
Pangborn ﬁlm club is Rob Dillon, a
senior majoring in Communications
and a student television producer
for Instructional Productions Ser-
vice in Hillman Library.

Last year, said Braverman, the
club produced a documentary ﬁlm

so-called underground film-
makers,” said Dillon.
SOCIAL COMMITTEE FILMS

Roktabija Abdul-Azeez has, for
the past two years, been chairman
of the Social Committee which
sponsors a series of current popular
ﬁlms on Friday nights.

Some of the ﬁlms in this series
for the fall term include Gone with
The Wind, on September 14, The
FrenchI'Connection on September
28, D . Zhivago on October 12,
Sounder on November 2, and The
Slaughterhouse Five on November

please everyone every week, but
we try to reach all members of the
campus community (students, fac-
ulty, staff) with, our ﬁlm program.

Abdul said the titles for the’

Friday ﬁlm‘ program are chosen by

members of the Social Committee“

based upon a survey taken of the
student body the previous term.
INTERNATIONAL FILMS

The University Center for Inter-
national Studies sponsors a series
of foreign films on Wednesday
evenings. A spokesman for this
group, Rose Mary Pease who heads
the East European section of the
program, said this series is also
having ﬁnancial difficulties.

“During the past two years we
operated the program on a grant
from the Pittsburgh Foundation."
said Pease. “But now that has

a

been discontinued and we are
solely subsidized by the 50 cents
admission charge."

Consequently, the program has
been curtailed. and there will not
be a ﬁlm showing every Wednes-
day.

Pease explained that the films
alternate between the four major
sections of the International
Studies program: Asian, Latin
American, Russian and East
European, and Western European.

“We choose contemporary ﬁlms
of international acclaim or ﬁlms
that are literary classics and useful
in the curriculum." said Pease.

CARNEGIE FILM SECTION

Located near the Pitt campus is
the Carnegie Institute which
maintains a Film Section curated
by Sally Dixon.

The film section began in 1970
and operates on grants from four
sources, according to Dixon.

On Sunday evenings the Film
Section offers a History of Film
series, free to the public, in the
Lecture Hall behing Carnegie
Library. ’

Starting in September this series
will feature silent classics by
George Melies, Edwin S. Porter
and D.W. Grifﬁth and later present
more -recent films such as The

Golem, Variety, Zero for Conduct, —

Goddard's Breathless,
Bunuel’s El Nazarin.

Another program sponsored by
the Film Section is the Independent
Filmmakers series which features a
well-known filmmaker who screens
his films and then discusses them
with the audience afterwards.
There is a $1.50 student admission
charge for each program in this
series. Stan Brakhage and Jonas
Mekas are two filmmakers to be
featured in the fall series,
according to Dixon."

The Film section also sponsors a
directors series, which is an “in
depth retrospective look at the
ﬁlms of one director. This fall,

and

with various interested persons to
coordinate film activities in
Pittsburgh. A group called the
Regional Film Council of Pitts-
burgh resulted from these
meetings.

Judson said the Council is also
working to get the University to

Danish director, Carl Dreyer will be 1' ‘

the subject of the program.
Admission is ‘also $1.50 per ﬁlm.
Dixon said the Film Section will
also sponsor a mini-course by
famous ﬁlmmakers at Pittsburgh
Filmmakers Cooperative in East

Liberty. This program will include "

an editing course by Bruce
Connors, a creative visual course
by Stan Brakhage, and an
animation course by Bob Breer.

“Many ﬁlms have as much depth
and complexity as the other art
forms. Jean Renoir’s ﬁlms are as
important as‘ his father’s paint-
ings," she said.

FACULTY FILM SPECIALIST

Coming to Pitt from Yale this
September will be William Judson,
a ﬁne arts instructor, who will be
teaching two ﬁlm courses during
the fall term: History of The
Cinema, and “Realism” and the
Documentary Film.

The fine arts specialist said his"
doctoral thesis at Yale was entitled
Film in Paris Before the First
World War.

recognize the ﬁlm courses at the
Filmmakers Cooperative so Pitt
students can register for them and
receive credit. ’

“I believe my coming to Pitt is
important because I am the first
instructor ever hired to teach film
courses exclusively. Other instruc-
tors have taught film courses on a
part-time basis, but their primary
interests are elsewhere,” he said.

Theatre Arts professor Dr.

Gillette Elvgren, will be teaching
the History and Esthetics of Film
course for the speech department
during the Winter Term.
M “This course will be a gener-
alized survey of classical and
current ﬁlms with emphasis on
constructual continuity. We want
to teach students to read a ﬁlm like
poetry or a novel” said Elvgren.

Coordinating ﬁlm programs, said
Elvgren, is important so that
teachers can share rented films
when they come in, and thus save
the University funds.

FILM RUSH
Most.public ﬁlm showings take
place in Lawrence Auditorium
which seats 1,000 people, The
University owns a large cinema-
500133 (wide) screen and high.

powered 16 mm projectors. Sound
has always been a problem in that
room because of the poor acoustical
design. Recently however, accord-
ing to sources in the Audio-Visual
Department, two large Voice to the
Theatre speakers have been
installed which will improve the
sound considerably.

In his famous 1925 classic, THE
eon) RUSH, Charles Chaplin
plays a lonely prospector in Alaska.

As in his other films, Charlie
awkwardly bungies through his
misadventures, suffers, and is
maligned. But in the end
everything surprisingly works out
for him. He strikes it rich and siso
wins a glamorous woman for his
wife.

 

The Battle of Algiers is a

French movie that is shown

frequently on campus.

Film program at Pitt’ follow a
similar scenario. Despite frequent
bungling, uncoordination, and al-
most slapstick confrontation at
times, everything fortunately has
worked out well in the end.

Majors was at his usual best at
the luncheon designed to kickoff
the summer practice session, which
was nothing new in itself. He was

DRILL.“

charming the news media and his
smile never deserted him, but he
presented the image of a man
telling a joke before jumping off the
bridge.

Going into camp, Majors didn’t
know who is going to throw the
ball, who is going to run the ball,
who is going to catch the ball, nor
who is going to tackle the man with
the ball defensively. That's not
good if you’re a football coach and
the opening game is a mere three
weeks awav

number 72, performs before the watchful eyes of coaches in the “NUTCRACKER
Coach Johnny Majors refused_to promise anything of the upcoming season except that he
‘ has installed pride and enthusiam "in the team, Photo by siege]

Breaking camp, many of Doctor
John's problems remain unre-
solved.

“I have never been this far
behind at such a late date before in
my coaching life." Majors said last
Saturday. “On the other hand, I've
never asked so» much from any
coaching staff or any group of
players before and I've never
received such a favorable response.

I'm pleased with that."
Still, as of Monday, Majors was
nabl to come up with anything

   
  

  

that resembled a depth chart.

4“A lot of the starting positions
are still undecided." the new
mentor said, “so I don't see how I
can give you a depth chart. I can
say that a lot of the backup jobs will
be won by default."

With all these seemingly crip-
pling problems playing such a
paramount role in his coaching life,
Majors didn't jump off the bridge.
In fact, he came out charging to
meet them head on.

On the first day of camp,
Johnny-On-The-Spot beat the

V rooster to the punch. It was 6:15 in

the morning and there was Majors
standing in the hall, yelling at the
top of his lungs:: “Everybody up,
the world is on firs!”

He was merely practicing what
he would be spending the week
preaching. If Majors and his staff
accomplished nothing else in
Johnstown, his troops learned the
meaning of “pride" and “enthu-

siasm"--words by which ht?
apparently lives by. The camp was
a tough one. The 95 degree
weather made it that much
tougher. The 141 athletes on hand
sweated, ran, sweated, hit. and
sweated some more. Major thinks
it has paid off. 

“I like the look in their eyes. We
might be limited in ability, but our
bellies are. trim and we are
hungry." he said.

“You don’t have to be smart to
coach for me, you don’t have to be
extremely talented to play for me,
but you had better be proud and
enthusiastic. I demand it.”

There is a mystique attached to
John Majors. While he is telling
you about his woes. he is also
convincing you that he will find a
way to ease them.

“We might not win a game this
year. but I guarentce you that we
will be cxcltitig. we will play with
pride zcntl we will he enthusiastic.

 will do wh'ale\'et' it tal<.cs.”

lllllllllllllllllllllllllIllllIlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIlllllllllllllllllllllllliilllllllllllllllillllltlllllllllllllllllilllllllllllllllll

The new look will feature white
shoes. a gold helmet with Pitt in
blue script letter. gold pants with a
blue stripe and white socks in blue
and gold trim. The home jersey
will be a lighter blue than in past
years with TV numbers, individual
names on the back and gold and
white sleeve striping. The away
jersey will be white, with gold and
blue trim. Quarterbacks, running
backs and receivers will wear
tear-away jersies.

When Johnny Majors reported to

football camp at the University of
Tennessee in 1953, he was the

smallest of 105 freshmen. “I
remember the first day we had to
scrimntagc: the varsit_\',"he recalled
“At i44lbs..l was scared to death.
Well the first time I got the ball, I
ran for seven yards, and the next
time for fourteen. As soon as
practice was over I ran to the
drugstore to call my dad, and I told
him, “They miss me here just like
they did in high school.”

Bowl
Talk

by VINCE DiNARDO

Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllll lllllllll I I I ll
IllllllllllllllllIIIlllllllllllllllIIIIIIIIIIlllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIC

A quick look at the Pitt Panther football stats was necessary to

“reaffirm the point. After taking one, it remains a fact the Cats shamed

themselves to a 1-10 record in 1972.

After spending last week in Johnstown. watching thePanthers in
summer practice. it sounded like Pitt was 10-! and that John Majors
had 50 lettermen returning for the open of the 1973 card. The Felines
open the new season against the Georgia Bulldogs September 15. in
Athens. Georgia. —

It was common to watch a rooter stroll to the practice field and begin
talking about which Bowl game Pitt would be in at the end of the year.
No, they were not a scattered few. The number of people engaging in
Bowl talk was surprising. Most agreed that the Orange Bowl might be
out of reach--this year. But some of the more vocal optomists felt the
Liberty Bowl would be a fine one to attend. The Peach or Sun Bowl
wouldn’t be bad either. Well!!!

“I just hope we can manage to stay out of the Toilet Bowl,” Doctor
John said one day last week.

Beyond the shadow of a doubt, Majors has made a devestating

’ impact on the Pitsburgh collegiate scene since taking the Pitt job in

January--that's on personality alone. Also. he has excited grid
ehthusiasts by bringing close to 80 new faces to the Oakland campus
(this number includes both freshmen and Jr. College transfers).

However, miracles are few and far between and let’s not forget that
it took Majors four years to perform his last miracle at Iowa State.
Bowl bound teams bring to mind eight or nine victories and that’s a bit
much to ask of the Panthers.

Nonetheless, predicting is as much a part of football as the quick
pitch and"no fan should be deprived the fun. So, after reading the
magazines and listening to the sports Journalists, we are able to record
the thoughts of these wise men (no sareaism intended):

Russ Franke (Pittsburgh Press): 5-6

Marino Parascenzo (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette):

John Majors: 1-10 -- “If we’re

Gameplan Magazine: either 3-8 or 4-7.

John Majors: 3-8 -- “I would be less than satisfied.”

Playboy Magazine: 6-5 .

Dean Billick (Pitt Sports Information Director): 6-5.

John Majors: “We could win four or five if we’re lucky.”

Steet & Smith Magazine: 7-3-1 -- (the one represents a tie with the
Northwestern Wildcats. How’s that for thorough evaluation).

John Majors: “If everything falls into place, we could win 6 or 7.”

Vince Di Nardo: 4-7. Gulpi

Oh yeah, no Bowl bid.

* =I< *

6-5

very unlucky.”

Hopewell freshman Tony Dorsett is a thing of beauty on the football
field. His press clippings don't do the 5-1 1, 175 High School
All-American enough justice. Not only is he fast--he runs the 40 in
4.4--but he is very quick and very shifty. There is no way Majors can
keep him off the starting team.

In his last two years at Hopewell, Dorsett ran for only 2, 272 yards
and a mere 42 touchdowns. Dorsett, a quiet chap, could be the key to
the success Pitt will or will not have in ’73.
at: are *

When Major's staff inked Gary Burley, they got themselves some
lineman--another sure fire starter. Burley weighs in at 250 and is 6-3.
He comes from Whartan Junior College in Texas where he was voted
two-time JC All-American. He was voted as the outstanding lineman
in Jr College football last season by Gridiron Magazine and--get this--
he was also voted the best JC lineman in the last ten years in Texas by
the opposing JC coaches. Welcome Gary Burley. *
>i= - *

Majors has said that 15-20 freshmen could make the traveling squad.
Along with Dorsett, add a dude by the name of John Hanhauser to that
_list. Hanhauser. an Erie, Pa. High School product. is a verv mean

Pirates Fire Virdon

PITTSBURGH AP -- The
Pittsburgh Pirates announced
Thursday that they, were firing
manager Bill Virdon and calling
back Danny Murtaugh to succeed
him effective immediately.

The announcement was made at
a hastily called late afternoon news
conference at Three Rivers
Stadium by Joe L. Brown, general
manager of the club, which has

been plagued by malady and
misfortune ever since star right
fielder Roberto Clemente was

killed in an airplane crash off

Puerto Rico Dec. 31. 1972.
Brown said Murtaugh, 56. and

affable. cigar-chewing Irish man.

In juries

Injuries have taken their toll on
the Panthers this season. and in
addition to the many minor ones.
there have been some that have
ended seasons or careers for Pitt
Gridders.

Fullback Paul Felinczak, who
missed all of last season with a leg‘
injury. attempted a comeback at
Johnstown. but was unable to make
a sufficient recovery. Rod Huth,
injured last season, will also be
unable to play football again.

Ken Paieski suffered\an unusual
injury while bicycling this summer,
and will miss most, if not all, of this
season. Don Siegle, defensive
back, broke his left arm at the
Johnstown camp, and will be lost
for the season. Siegle, who is the
top pitcher for the Pitt baseball
team, unfortunately sustained the
injury on his pitching arm. Jim
Smith and Mike Formichella, have
also suffered injuries that will
probably keep them out for the
season. j

The following recruits did not
show up at the Johnstown training
camp: Conrad Feltner, James
Leonard. Steve Robatin, Rick
Faulk. and Pat Kelly.

The following varsity lettermen
have left the team at various times
since the conclusion of last season:
Eric Knisley. Lance Wall, Paul
Mariano, Lou Cecconi and Dan
Smith.

would remain as manager at least
through 1974.

Brown refused to discuss his
reasons for the shuffle, but said the
announcement was his “most
difficult...in my 35 years of
baseball."

Virdon, 42, who had succeeded
Murtaugh as manager after the
Pirates’ 1971 World Series victory
over Baltimore said he had no
immediate plans beyond a vaction.

Murtaugh was not immediately
available for comment.

Brown's announcement was
made as the team, after a day off,
was preparing to leave for
Philadelphia. where they begin a
weeken series against the Phillies
Friday.

Player reaction was mixed,
sources close to the club said. One
bystander said catcher Manny
Sanguillen had tears in his eyes
when he learned of the change.
Others appeared unconcerned,
while some seemed shaken, by-
standers said.

The team knew something was
wrong, sources added, when
Virdon’s gear was removed at the
last minute from a truck that was to

carry club equipment to the airport.

Murtaugh joined the team's '
front office as director of player
acquisition and development when
he stepped aside as manager in
1971.

Virdon. who _had been
Murtaugh's right hand man during
the 1970-71 seasons, often stepping
to serve in place of the folksy
Murtaugh when the latter was
sidelined with illness. He was the
team's batting and outfield coach
from 1968 to 71. I

Calm and unflappable like his
boss, Virdon seemed a natural for
the manager‘s job when Murtaugh
told a Nov. 23, 1971 news
conference that he was calling it
quits. '

Wait until you see Carson Long kick. This Ashland, Pa. native
doesn’t have legs; he has telephone poles. Long kicked 17 field goals
at North Schuykill High School a year ago. Among them were boots of
51 and 54 yards--the latter is a state scholastic record

Last Saturday at Johnstown, Long barely missed a 52 yard try. He
had the distance by ten yards, but he was wide to the right. In that
same scrimmage, Long clicked on kicks of 22, 32 and 38 yards. Of note
is the fact that the Panthers failed to kick a ﬁeld goal in the eleven
games last year.

Link, a 6-1, 235 pound lineman from Uniontown was named to the
Big 33 team and was a first team All-Stater. He is very versitile and
has shown promise at linebacker, offensive guard, and middle guard.

Murtaugh B110 Skipper

Danny Murtaugh, the craggy-
faced rocking chair strategist
whose managerial magic brought
the Pittsburgh Pirates two World
Series titles, has answered the
encore call once again.
Newsmen gaped in disbelief
Thursday as Pirate General Mana-
ger Joe Brown announced that the
56-year-old Murtaugh would come
out of retirement for the second
time in four years in an effort to
turn the tide for the Pirates.

Many of those same startled
newsmen were on a riverboat
pleasure cruise in 1970 when
Murtaugh and Brown walked
casually up a staircase and
announced that Murtaugh would
replace ﬁred Larry Shepard as the
club’s ﬁeld boss.

Heart trouble had prompted
Murtaugh to retire initially in 1964,
‘four years after and he guided the
Pirates to a World Series victory
over the Yankees.

However, Murtaugh revealed on

triumph over Baltimore.

Shortly after that 1971 season,
Murtaugh announced again that he
was retiring, at least partly because
of a recurrence of his health
problems. At that time, former
Pirate outfielder Bill Virdon was
named to follow Murtaugh.

Yet Virdon was fired Thursday as
manager of the struggling Pirates,
and Murtaugh was tabbed to
succeed the man who had
succeeded him.

So Murtaugh's rocking chair and
the glistening spitoon that accomo-
dates his ever present chaw of
tobacco will return to the managers
dressing room at Three Rivers
Stadium.

The Chester, Pa., native, visited
Pittsburgh a few weks ago, taking a
break from his job as the Pirates

Daniels No Back Door Man

BY VINCE DI NARDO
Johnny Majors’ right arm was
cocked and he was pumping it as if

‘ he were a quarterback throwing

from the pocket. He looked at the
group of media people surrounding
him and said: ‘If we only had one
of these."

BILL DANlELS* above. goes into
the season opener against Georgia
as the starting quarterback.

Daniels had a fine shwoing at

 

   
   

A week ago Majors had a
problem. It was no’ Edipus
Complex, it was just that Majors
didn't think he had a quarterback
to count on.

The newspapermen recorded
Majors’ feelings and junior
quarterback Bill Daniels was a little

preseason camp and disspelled
rumors that he inherited the job
only after Bob Medwid underwent

disappointed’ by them. Daniels felt
strange because as far as he was
concerned he had solved the Pitt
quarterbacking problem last
November 25. when he won the No.
1 job and started the Penn State
game.

However, Daniels didn‘t fare to
well in Spring ball and returnee
Bob Medwid did. When Medwid
became injured and was ruled out
for the opening game against the
Georgia Bulldogs, the new coach
worried.

Before departing for summer
camp Majors said. “Our quarter-
backing is a question mark. It's
wide open. Bill Daniels will have to
come to the front."

Daniels is a 5-11. 180 Montour
High grad who blushes easily and
talks very quietly. When he was
interrupted one afternoon last
week. while trying to catch a
snooze before the afternoon work-
out. he blushed. spoke in a mild
manner. ancfmade a couple of good

camp doesn't mean a thing. If I
were the number one quarterback
at the Georgia game, now that
would mean something," he noted.

“I know the writers have been
saying that Pitt needs a quarter-
back...l don’t agree.”

“I ran second and third team all
last year until I earned the job at
Penn State. Then all of a sudden, I
was second team again in the
spring. I've been lucky so far this
year though. everything has
happened at the right time. Bob
(Medwid) got hurt but that's a
break for me.

“I'm not trying to beat anybody.
I'm just trying to do the best I can.
That's why I wish Bob wasn't hurt.
I think some people will say that I
came in through the back door.”

Daniels came on strong at the
latter part of last year. He
completed 6 of 7 passes against
Navy, for 113 yards and one TD.

diligently. He has been a spark out
on the field. He-has a nice arm for
a college quarterback.”

‘How things turn out’ in the first

to a large extent. Behind him there
are a ton of freshmen and Rich
Washinko. Washinko has yet to
see any varsity action.

When Medwid returns, Majors
will have a different. but much
more desirable, QB problem. He
will have two to choose from

instead of one. For Pitt's sake. ithsg
a good thing Daniels came to the

front. If he hadn't Majors would
still be pumping his arm saying. “I

“We‘re a very young team with
mostly sophomores, freshmen and

 

a sprinkling ofjuniors but we have ‘

a lot of talent."

These are the words of Coach Jim
Banner used to describe Pitt’s 1973
Cross Country team. “The boys
have really practiced long and hard
all summer averaging eighty miles
a week." Inexperience will of
course take its toll but the list of top
prospects overshadows the inex—
perience. Men like Micky Collins.
Rick Markley. Jack Patrick, Bob
O’Neal. and Nick Martin are being
heavily counted on by Coach
Banner. Bob Steele. who placed
7th in the IC4A last year, is back
eager to do better along with Terry
Wile, a freshman who was state
champ last year in high school.

When questioned on scholarship
allocation. Coach Banner simply
looked skyward and said,“No
comment. that's a dead subject."
Obviously the realignment of
football has affected track also.

Banner is highly optimistic and
very confident of a good season.

  Skaters On Thin Ice--Financially

BY BART MACK

ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR

Three years ago a freshman by
the name of Joe Testa organized
the Pitt Hockey Club for any
student interested in pursuing the
game. At that time the team
consisted of only a handfull of
members and all expenses were

’;;;i=i.-L»vered by the squad.

4 .

In the following year, the
Western Pa. Collegiate Hockey
Association was born and" Pitt,
along with Carnegie-Mellon. Du-
quesne. Penn State (McKeesport),
liidiana, St. Vincent,‘ Slippery Rock
and St. Francis formed the two
divisions that were the foundation
of hockey at the collegiate level in
the local tri-state area. Pitt has
sinceireined as champion of that
league in those two years.

This season, however. could be
quite a different story for Pitt. As
the realm of the league, in regard
to quality of play and public
'nterest is concerned, new higlits
have been achieved. Enthusiasm
has gown in monumental propor-
tions in the Pittsburgh area and
throughout the state of

Pennsylvania. Pitt. however, niay_

find itself looking up this year. a
mere spectator.

As of this writing, the Pitt
Hockey Club is in financial limbo.
The Allocations Committee, a part
of Student Government supported
by the executive board, has denied
the Hockey Club ﬁnancial support.

That denial by the Allocations
Committee did not come without
some justifications. The Hockey
Club did meet with Allocations over
the summer, submitting a request
for $6,060.00 but the Club did not
have “definite” plans for the use of
the funds. Pitt was desperately
trying to improve their status in the
collegiate club hockey level but
ﬁnal plans were not realized until
after the Allocation 5 Committee
had dispensed with their money.

Pitt had the option of joining a
new league. one that would be
made up of club teams from the
eastern Pa. area. That option,
however. meant expenses for the
team to cover a 28 game schedule
which involved extensive traveling
and a much larger finanacial
budget. That plan was scrapped
and Pitt has renewed commitments
to the WPCHA. with a few
changes.

The Club is currently scheduled
to play up to 10 games in the Civic
Arena and to practice at the
Sewickly Arena. Last season Pitt
played all of their home contests at
the Alpine Ice Chalet and one
exhibition game at the Civic Arena.

   

The skaters found the confines of
the Sewickly rink to be far superior
to the Alpine and, what can be
considered most important, less
expensive. The decision to play
their home games at the Civic
Arena was founded on the success
of last winter's West Penn
Tournament. In that tourney. Pitt
met C—MU and Indiana played
Duquesne in the second part of the
doubleheader. A crowd of 2,800
turned out for the first college
hockey tournament ever staged in
the city of Pittsburgh.

The cost to play in the Big Igloo
would be $300 per team, but the
costs would be coveredby gate
receipts since all games would be
part of a doubleheader involving
Pitt, C-MU. Duquesne and
Indiana. All other Pitt games
would be played at the Sewickly
Arena.

The Allocations Committee had
also requested information as to
what the other clubs in the
WPCHA were receiving. Pitt
Hockey Club organizers ran into
communication problems in this
aspect. Since all teams in the
league are clubs and not varsity
sports, it was near impossible to
contact members of the other
league teams since their respective
univesities did not keep records on
them.

Again, this information came too
late to the Allocations Committee.
Carnegie-‘Mellon was given $5,000
for the use of their hockey club (this
figure does not include contri-
butions made by alumni) and
Duquesne received $6,195. Penn
State at University Park (who Pitt
usually plays in exhibition although
they do not belong to the WPCHA)
is funded to the tune of $6,000.
This also does not take into
consideration the fact that they
have the use of a university rink for

JOE TESTA* pictured above
skaters may find themselves out in
denied them ﬁnancial support.

ice time, which is ‘the primary
expense for any club.

At the present time, the future of
the Pitt Hockey Club is hanging on
an upcoming meeting with their
faculty advisor. Doctor Micheal
Sherman. Club organizers are
scheduled to meet with Dr.
Sherman on Monday to decide the
future of the team.

Another item on the agenda of
the meeting will be the formation of
a girls squad, if the interest of‘ the
female students is enthusiastic.
Other items will be a series of
exhibition contests with clubs such
as Penn State, Maryland,
Tennesse, Navy. West Virginia,
Gannon, Bucknell and lthica.
Hopefully, the basic information
already mentioned will be pre-

  Booters   Favored In Opener

BY YAIER LEHRER

A well balanced, ball control
attack is what Coach Leo Bemis
plans to use against the young
Geneva varsity soccer squad
immediately following the football
scrimmage at Pitt stadium to-
morrow at about 1:30.

The Panthers will be out to keep
their streak going of having been

undefeated in three years of league

play compiling a record of 13-0 in

the Western Pennsylvania Col-

legiate Soccer Conference of which
they have been champs for the past
two years.

Bemis has had to juggle the
line-up a little in an effort to plug
up the large hole left by Gary
Midock, the keystone of last year’s
defense’.

L As it stands right now, Ray Rex,
one of the fastest men on the team,
will be converted from the wing
position to a defensive spot with
two-year letterman Fernando Car-
riquiry from Peru moving into a
middle defensive spot with him.
The strongest candidates for the
other two defensive positions are

for the booters.

There is also a strong nucleus of
returnees this season including a
surehanded Bill Haines at the
goalie position, three-year letter-
man Dennis Kohlmyer, and the
primary scorer for the Panters, Joe
Luxbacher.

lt’s possible that freshmen Boris
Protionak, a South High graduate,

‘and ‘Jim De’Leo of the WPIAL

champs, Upper St. Clair could see
some action and have every chance
of playing first team ball this year.

This line-up will face a young
Geneva soccer team that has
nothing to lose and everything to
gain in a game against the Panther
booters. In only their second year
of varsity soccer, a win over Pitt
could make their season.

“We expect a very spirited team
effort from the Geneva team,” says

‘Bemis, “but I hope that their
inexperience will not lead to a
feeling of over-confidence in our
own players.”

The Panthers have not had as
much time to prepare themselves
as their opponents and this could
be a prime factor in the game. The
Pitt booters will only have three
days of practice before their first
game but Bemis hopes that they
have kept themselves in good
enough condition in the off season.

As for the rest of the season,
Bemis says that “If we can
crystallize a good defense, plug up
our big holes I feel we can really
improve our attack and have‘a very
good season.”

year, according to Bemis.
However, the distance between
bases has decreased from sixty-five
feet to sixty.

Games will start each week day
at approximately four o’clock on
the two athletic fields behind the
stadium, and will continue for
about five weeks. Playoffs will
follow to determine whether or not
the Charlie Browns and Superflies
can successfully defend their
summer titles in the men’s and
women’s divisions, respectively.
(The Charlie Browns also won last
fall’s title.) Playoff games could
not be held last fall, as the ﬁeld
lights were not installed at the
time.

Intramural six-man soccer will
also start soon, and touch football
will begin in about five weeks.
Soccer entries should be in by
September 14. With the upcoming
diversified winter program that is
also set up, no student on campus
should complain about not having

NCAA Splits Schools

Into Three Divisions

The National Collegiate Athletic
Association gave overwhelming
approval to a split of its 667-school
membership into three autonomous
divisions for competitive and
legislative purposes. A

In the first special convention in
its 67-year history, the NCAA
favored by a 366-13 vote the
historic reorganization which puts

major football powers in

iihzfsion I and some 310 smaller

schools into Divisions lland III.
Starting with the 1974 con-
vention at San Francisco Jan. 7-9,
legislative voting will be divided
into the three divisions.
The reorganization also es-

I tablished a minimum of 39 national

championships under NCAA spon-

' sorship, with at least 10 in each

division.

It will allow schools to decide _

"_.'7.\_':'i"1’-: 
 ‘ l‘

which division they will join, except
126 schools now classiﬁed as major
in football which automatically will
be considered in Division I.

Institutions in Division II or III
will be allowed to compete in one
sport, other than football or
basketball. in Division I. The plan.
however, will allow a Division I
school to compete in, for instance.
football in Division II or III.

The voting provisions call for any...
division to have reviewed by the
full convention legislation liable to
be rescinded by a two-thirds vote.

An attempt by the Atlantic Coast
Conference to waive the full
membership two-thirds Control was
defeated as spokesmen for several
black conferences and schools
protested that such action would
disintegrate the entire NCAA
program.

Charles D. Henry of Grambling,
La., asserted that a complete
division would enable major
schools to gobble up “not onlythe
blue chip athletes but most of the
purple ones, too.”

Once a division established
criteria for membership, each
school in that division will have five
years to meet the criteria.

At the NCAA’s regular con-
vention in Chicago in January an

, attempt to restructure the member-
ship into only large and small

colleges was defeated, mainly
because no definite norms for
separation were advanced.

Long Lives .UpTo"His N

BY RON SIEGEL
SPORTS EDITOR

The youthful placekicker con-
centrates on the spot where his
holder is about to receive the snap.
“It's the Orange Bowl, fourth
quarter. ten‘ seconds to go," he
tells himself. “ifl make it, we win
the game." Carson Long reacts to
the snap and sends a kick towering
high above the crossbar, and Pitt
just won the Organge Bowl. Well.
Although this scene
may really happen in the next four
years. right now it is merely the
imagination of Pitt's freshman
kicking sensation. “I like to
pretend it's a pressure situation, so
that I'll be used to in the games,"
he explained.

51-yard kicks are not uncommon
for Long. In practice sessions, he’ll
attempt at least ten of them from
the sideline stripes. He’ll include
some in his pre-game preparation,
and this should give the Pitt

I Stadium early-birds something to

ooh and ah about.

Carson Long decided at age 13
that he wanted to be a professional
football player. “I knew I'd never
have the size or the speed to be a
regular player, so I decided to
become a kicker," he explained.
At ﬁrst I punted the ball over the
crossbar, but then I saw a‘ game on
television and found out that that
wasn’t three points.” ’ ‘

From a rather dubious begin-
ning, Long emerged as a premier
placekicker by practicing every
day. His longest high school kick
was 54 yards, and is _the longest ‘
ﬁeld goal ever kicked in Penn-
sylvania, including colleges and

professionals. His legs have been
likened to treetrunks in thickness.

“I wished I could bypass college
football," said Long. “But I knew I
couldn't and besides, I'm going to
play four years at Pitt for Coach
Majors. even ifI could go the pros
earlier.”

The impression Majors made on
Long was phenominal. Contacted
by Majors, who was still at Iowa
State, and many other schools as
early as his junior year, Long was
leaning toward a southern school or
Penn State, which is just an hour
and a half away from his Ashland,
Pa. home. “Then one bleak, snowy
winter day last January, I was
called from one of my classes into
the coach’s office, and there was
Johnny Majors. I was shocked to
see him.”

Despite Long’s protests about
inclimate weather, Majors went to
meet Carson's family, and several
days later, Pitt had practically
insured that it wouldn’t go two
seasons in a row without kicking a
ﬁeld goal. Majors was almost
killed on that fruitful visit, as his
car repeatedly spun off the road on
the return trip on a foggy, icy
Interstate 81.

“Coach Majors was very truthful
with me. He lets me work on my
own , and gives me lots of
encouragement. I like his ideas
and philosophies. and just want to
be part of a great system and a
great team," said Long, the
entusiasim showing by the in-
creased loudness of his voice.

Upon seeing Long kick for the
first time in person, Majors told
him, “If anybody tries to tell you
anything about kicking, you tell

. as well.

them to come see the kicking
coach, and that’s me. And I don’t
know a thing about kicking.”

Majors later delegated the kicking
coach chores to sportscaster Myron

Cope.

Long
shoes and a normal
encrusted into the tee is an
Eisenhower dollar. The name of
the tee is “On The Money.” Long
explained that the dollar was not
really signiﬁgant, it just gives the
holder a place to set the ball
down.

Long works out on his own each
practice day, booting an average of
100 ﬁeld goals per day. He doesn’t
kick too many from the twenty
yard-line hashmarks, but rather
spends most of his time kicking
forty-yarders from the sidelines, or
straight on. ﬁfty-yarders. He’ll
make more than he’ll, miss from the
above ranges.

Pitt’s kick-offs should be sailing
off the six-foot, 195 pounder’s toes
“That’s an area where I
need a little work,” he confessed.
Long’s kick-offs always reach the
five yard line or beyond, but this
does not satisfy him. “It’s a great
feeling to kick one out of the
end zone, but I only did that twice
last season.” Long is not afraid to
risk an injury to make a tackle on a
kick-off return. “I don’t believe in
injuries to myself,” he stated
flatly. “Injuries are mainly
psychological.”

Another one of Carson’s daily
routines in the practice sessions is
to challenge defensive line coach
Jim Dyar, who holds the record for
ﬁeld goals in a season at the
University of Houston, to a kicking

standard kicking
tee, but

contest. The record there is four,
and as Dyar, who once rode the
equipment truck to a big game
explained, “Coach Yeoman didn’t
like kickers.” Well anyhow, Dyar

kicks quite well, and when he
visited Carson at his home, Carson
immediately thought, “Oh Boy,
competition. ”

So each day at the end of
practice, Long and Dyar trot out to
the ﬁeld to determine who will beat

—<.§\(/~.«5';\.a

Baylor with the winning kick. Dyar 

usually matches Carson at forty 4“
yards, but is no match at ﬁfty.

season in '72, then hired a new
coach--Johnny Majors--and im-
mediately began losing again. But
this time what the players lost was
pounds--more than 700 of them
during winter conditioning drills,
as Majors tried for a new, quicker
look at Pitt.

Junior college transfers and some
blue-chip prospects from western
Pennsylvania who are entering
freshmen could comfort Majors as
he embarks on the difficult course
of making Pitt an Eastern power
again. ' -

Prediction: Tenth in the East.

GRIDIRON NEWS: Coach
extraordinaire Johnny Majors has
come over from Iowa State, and he
brings with him all his powers
which have enabled him to become

. one of the best, brightest coaches

on the college scene. He also
brings with him one of his former
players, Larry Holton, 26, who will
work on the defensive staff.

The ability to scout good talent,
one of Majors’ prime assets, has
already been put to good use. He
has acquired star players from
many states. Linebacker Gary

PLAYBOY: New coach Johnny
Majors takes over at Pitsburgh,
making the future prospects bright.
It's about time. The Panthers have
been battered and bruised since

- their last winning season, in 1963;

so university administrators ﬁnaly
decided to take drastic action. First
Pitt withdrew from the Big Four,
an arrangement that severely
limited recruiting and red-shirting.
Then Majors was lured from Iowa
State with a lucrative salery and a
pledge of heavy alumni support,
ﬁnancial and otherwise; and even
though the talented Majors can’t
transform the Panthers in a single
season, fans will see a few
immediate signs of what the future
holds. Two freshmen, Tony
Dorsett and Carson Long, should‘
provide more scoring punch.

Prediction: 5-6. ‘ All-East

GAMEPLAN FOOTBALL:

Johnny Majors is one of those rare
individuals who, like the mythical
King Midas, turns everything he
touches into gold. Previous
examples of his handiwork include
an All-American playing career at
Tennessee, and a successful tenure
as Iowa State head coach. Now he
faces the toughest job of his life as
he tries to put the bite back in the
Panthers.

 What The Grid Experts Predict j

Coach Majors isn’t the only new’
face on campus. A number of
tested junior college transfers and
blue-chip freshmen have been
lured to Pitt. Although it'll take a
while to build a winner in the Steel
City, the Panthers are an improved
football team.

Prediction: Look for them to win
three or four games this fall.
Rating: fourth in the East.

SPORTS ILLUSTRATED: John-
ny Majors, that young miracle
worker now at Pittsburgh could not
have created more confusing
excitement if he had dropped to the
campus in a balloon. So drastic
were his problems that Majors
acted like the general manager of
an expansion baseball team,
inviting a unheard-of 150 players to
try out this fall. A number of last

 
 
   
 
 
 

year’s players have quit the team
amidst Majors’ youth movement,
so Pitt should ﬁeld a very different
Panther in 1973. Not a bad idea
when you were 1-10. *

THE SPORTING NEWS: Pitt is
one of eight Eastern schools that
reached for a new coach. Johnny
Majors is his name, and the
ex-mentor of Iowa State hasn't lost
any of his cyclone tendancies,
cutting a wide swath in the
recruting mart from coast to coast.

-The ex-Tennessee tailback has

signed about 80 bodies, many at
the speed positions where Pitt"has
been hurting.

Majors may not make Pitt
“Major League” in just one
season, but it’s obvious that the
Pitts are not going to be everyone’s
pushover much longer.

Bottom Right: Sportscaster,
Myron Cope, has been appointed

Cope stressed that Long should not
smoke while kicking, and also told
Carson to ignore what any
sportscaster told him about kick-

to 150 ﬁeld goals each day,
depending on how he feels.
