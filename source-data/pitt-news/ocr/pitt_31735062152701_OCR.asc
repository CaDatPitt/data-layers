’ Furthermore the series of pictures
showed what steps have been taken

also described the measures whichare

LETTER BOX |

Editor PITT WEEKLY: .
Would it not be possible to devise
some means so that the classes in
Halls would know
when the hour is up. . Present condi-
tion require that the instructor regu-
late the length of the recitation accord-
ing to his own watch and his watch
is usually at variance with those of
the students The classes are always
held over-time and the students must
stand the loss in their class. I person-
ally have only two classes a week in
those halls, but both of these classes
are always held at. least ﬁve and
sometimes ten minutes over time. This
is not right and deserves consideration
on the part of the authorities. \
.Cordially yours,
A’ Senior.

Editor PITT'WEEKLY:

Little did Bacon think how far the
world would diverge from his state-
ment, ‘fstudies serve for delight, for
ability and for ornament” when he
wrote his essays on “Studies.”_

Students do not take. up studies
for the purpose deﬁned by Bacon in
thismodern day, but for purely utili-
tarian purposes. Indeed so much de-
ference has been given to it by schools
in allowing electives, that one may
ﬁnd expert mining and electrical en-
gineers graduated from great uni-
versities and technical schools, who
know little or nothing of ancient or
literature, ‘and. who can
scarcely write a short letter in correct
English. They passed by the studies
of cultural character, because they
were not “required.”

It seems to «me that the features of
a liberal and cultured education can-
not be acquired in any other ‘way than
by reading and studying the works
of the masters of the literatures ‘of
all ages. The present attention given
to these studies is scant and the
student loses something that he can-
not make up after leaving college.

Let us pay more attention to the
fundamental cultural studies while we
are in school, and specialization can
be done well after college days are
over. ,

Sincerely,
A Reader.

THE WESTMORELAND
COUNTY _CLUB.

Tonight will be a big night for
Pitt men in Westmoreland County
when a “Pitt Club” will be organized
there. Membership is to be..restricted
to students and alumni whose homes
are in that section. The aims and
purposes of the Club will be similar
to those of the “Jefferson County Pitt
Club,” which was organized during the
holidays. Its primal obect will be
“to boost the University at every op-
portunity.” It can help attract stud-
ents to the University, cement the re-
lations between Alma Mater and
the graduate, and help Chancellor~Mc-
Cormick show to the‘ state legislators
why Pitt should‘ have a liberal appro-
priation this year and in future years.
The “Jeffersoi-i County Pitt Club,”
with a live Secretary in Fred Jordan,
'18, has already started things along
these lines and with the Westmore-
dandites working too, we can expect
ﬁne results.

Or. B. F. Jenkins, '06, of Jeannette,
a true blue Pitt man and a loyal work-
er for Alma Mater, is Chairman of
the Committee on‘ Arrangements. ‘Dr.
Jenkins used to manage the Varsity
football team during his days as an
undergraduate and he knows how to
handle an affair of this kind.’ He has
made arrangements for thedinner and
meeting at the Hotel Monohan at
Greensburg, the former starting at
6:30, and the business meeting follow-
ing. The rate is 75 cents per plate.
Alumni and students will be present
from all parts of Westmoreland
county.

Several hundred letters were mailed
to individuals and, in addition to this,
there were boosters in each of the big
centers stir up the Pitt men. They
have all worked with a determination
that spells success'for the meeting
tonight. Newspaper publicity was not
neglected and every paper in the coun-
ty had several write-ups regarding
the meeting. It is certain that West-
nioreland county is more stirred up
over. Pitt than ever before. After the
club becomes organized and in work-
ing shape, we hope to ‘sew up” the old
county for us stronger than ever.

A number of prominent University
workers will attend the meeting.
Chancellor McCormick will be there
and so will Dean H Edmund Friesell,
of the Dental school,- Charles W.
.Scovel, Chairman of the Alumni Or-
ganizations Committee of Council, the
General Secretary, -and several others.

The Organizations Committee in-
cludes the following alumni and stud-
ents:

B. F. Jenkins, D.D.S., ’06, Jeannette;

R. E. L. McCormick, M.D., '03, Irwin;

H. A. McMurray, M.D., '05, Young-

nor, Smyers, Ramsey, Reizenstein, Mc-
Kean, Scovel, Coffin, McKenna, Saal-
bach, Houston, Wurdack, Heckel,
Booth, Biddle, Koch, Judd and the

a report of the Special Committee
appointed some time ago to revise _the
Constitution and By-Laws of the Gen-
eral‘ Alumni association and the Al-
umni Council. A meeting of this Com-
mittee had been held the same even-
ing at 6 o'clock at the P. A. A., with
Chairman W. C. Coffin presiding.

The changes recommended by the
committee were, in brief, as follows
and related chieﬂy to the personnel of
Council: ~ .

At present, that body is composed.

of 50 members, 14 being atplarge and
siii each from the following six

ischools:——Col1ege, Engineering, Medi-

cal, Law, Dental and Pharmacy. It
is proposed to have 32 members at

schools :-—-College, Engineering, Med-
ical, Law, Pharmacy, Dental, Mines,

A Nominating Committee, to be ap-
pointed by the Chairman of Council,
and consisting of one representative
from each of the nine schools named,
to make nominations for officers of the
Alumni association and for members
of the Alumni Council.. They to pre-
pare a ticket, containing at least one
name for each vacancy. This ticket
will be published in THE WEEKLY.
the official organ of the association, at
least sixty days before the annual
meeting. Other nominations may be
made by- petition of five or more al-
umni, said petition to be placed in the
hands of the General Secretary at
least ﬁfteen days before the annual
meeting. Notices of receipt of such
petition or petitions, with name or
names of nominees, will be printed in
THE WEEKLY and the names added
to the official ballot.

Other changes recommended were
as follows:

For the annual meeting to be hel
in June instead of February. 

For the originating of "Subscrib-
ing Members” who may, if they de-
sire, contribute more than the annual
dues of $2.00 to aid toward the upkeep
of alumni activities at the University.

For the election of ten honorary

vice-presidents, the idea being to
honor well known alumni.
Consideration of whether women

shall be admitted to the Association.

BY ACTION OF COUNCIL, A
SPECIAL MEETING OF THE GEN-
ERAL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION
WAS CALLED FOR SATURDAY,
JANUARY 30, AT 8 P. M., IN ROOM
302 THAW HALL, FOR FINAL
ACTION ON REPORT OF COM-
MITTEE. NOTICES OF‘ THIS
MEETING, SETTING FORTH THE

SIRED.

CHARTER DAY BANQUET.

Once again. let us remind you of the
plans‘ for Charter Day, Friday, Feb.
26, and esepecially the Alumni Ban-
quet to be held at the Hotel Schenley.
starting at 6:30 P. M. The Entertain-
ment Committee is already hard at
work to make this an affair long to
be remembered by those who attend.
The speakers’ list will be a notable
one, at least one of thefamous visitors
who will._attend the dedicatory exer-
cises of the Mellon Institute respond-
ing to a toast.

The Committee has a man in view
for the position of toast master who
is well qualiﬁed for the important
berth and there is little doubt of his
acceptance. In order to allow those
who attend to go to the reception in
the Mellon Institute at 9 p. m.. or the
Cap and Gown club show at the Schen-

ley theater at 8:45, there will be only
a short list of speakers and their talks
won't be long draw out. But they
will be unusually bright and interest-
ing. s _ . A

A rate per plate of $2.00 has been
decided on. Bring the ladies.

Music, decorations and all the “side
trimmins" won't be neglected.

Watch these columns for announce-
ments from week to week.

And DON'T FORGET TO PUT
THE DATE DOWN IN YOUR
LITTLE RED BOOK. .

THE JUNIOR PROM.

Chairman A. K. Collingwood. '16,
of the Junior “Prom" Committee has
left a supply of tickets with the Gen-
eral Secretary and he is prepared to
furnish to all alumni who desire to
attend.. The rate for alumni is ﬁve
dollars.

The “Prom" this year will undoubt-
edly be the best ever held as it will
be an exclusive Pitt affair. Only stud-
ents, alumni and those officially con-
nected with the University will be able
to purchase tickets. The adoption of
this policy was a distinct step forward
as, in past years. the real Pitt crowd
has been rather forced to the wall
by outsiders. The “Prom" is growing
so popular that a rule of this kind
can be lived up to without taking ﬁ-
nancial risks and there is sure to be a
ﬁne turn-out.

THE ONE YEAR RULE.

 

57.28 Baum Boulevard,
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Mr. K. E. Davis, General Secretary

University of Pittsburgh Alumni

Association, Pittsburgh. V
Dear Sir:

As an alumnus of Pittsburgh _and
one always interested in the welfare
of my Alma Mater I take the liberty
of expressing to you my views on the
proposed rule which will require one
year of attendance at the University
before ‘a man may engage in inter-
collegiate athletics contests and which
will limit these activities to three
years.

By this rule we would give the new
men a better opportunity to start their
college work right, to devote more
time to their studies, and we would
eliminate the man who is in school
primarily for athletics. , It is quite
essential for. this sort of a fellow to

e on the varsity team from start to
ﬁnish and he will consequently be
discouraged from entering our Uni-
versity. This is the man who gives a
bad color to athletics. The three‘ year
ru1e_does not always accomplish this
but is a long step in the right direc-
tion. The strength of our teams
might often be impaired but we can
well afford this in order to promote
clean athletics. Certainly clean ath-
letics is far more important than vic-
torious teams. -

It seems to me that college athletics
serves three purposes: ﬁrst, the physi-
cal development of the participants;
second, the development of college
spirit in the undergraduate body and
among alumni; third, it is the most
potent advertising medium obtain-
able. _

Under our present system the ﬁrst
of these objects is probably accom-
plished as well as by any other.

The undergraduate and the alumnus
justly speak with pride of his success-
ful athletic teams and how much deep-
er -will be his pride, and how much
more justiﬁ-able, if he knows that
every effort is being put forth to de-
velop clean athletics in his Alma
Mater. This is one form of true col-
lege spirit. A _ ‘

As to the advertising feature of

athletics we have before us a great

task. It is undesirable that a" large
number of misinformed people have a
greatly erroneous idea of our athletic
teams and hence of our school. So
it is_ up_to us to leave no stone un-
turned in an effort to correct this
opinion. Much has been. done during
the last_ few years but even now we
are criticized because we do not en-

‘_ force a three year rule.

_ Opponents of this_3~iile will say that
it does not accomplish its object and
assuming this to be the case it is

_-nevertheless necessary that ‘we must
adopt it to obtain the athletic repu-

tation which we deserve.

. I believe that the vast majority of
our graduates will welcome the adop-
tion_and- enforcement of this rule in
the immediate future.

Yours very sincerely,
- PHILIP E. ENGLE, Eng., '08.

At Yale but 38 men are allowed to

of whom graduate this year. No‘
man has won his letter in more than
one major sport. .

As the result of a law recently
adopted in the state of Michigan to
the effect that it shall be a criminal
act to carry a red ﬂag, Harvard stu-
dents were not permitted to display
their college pennants. The’ law while
aimed at the Socialists hit the stu-
dents as well. '

Dr. A. R. Taylor, former president
of the Kansas State Normal, has ﬁg-
ured out on the basis of efficiency
that college education is worth $200
per day.

At W. & J. the Freshmen are now
allowed to live in the fraternity
houses. For some time this has not
been allowed. A short time ago, how-
ever, a committee of the faculty car-
ried on an investigation which pro-
duced results extremely favorable to
the fraternities. It was found that
the‘ men living in the fraternity houses

 

ranked higher in their studies than
then men living outside of the houses.

PITT Pissins
nuwu sum
BY FASTWORK

Pitt, 35; Penn State, 32; this was
the score marked up at the end of one
of the hardest fought contests ever
seen on the local basketball ﬂoor. An
enthusiastic crowd ﬁlled Trees‘ gym-
nasium andsurged out on the ﬂoor.
Time after time the score was tied
only to be broken by some ‘brilliant
shot. So intense was the interest
manifested that at one moment the
building ‘shook with applause only to
be followed by a tense silence as one
of the players tried for a goal or the
ball hovered around the ring. Bril-
liant team work combined with one
of the best exhibitions of guarding
ever seen here, made the game one
long to be remembered.

After the close game of the night be.

.fore with Juniata, the Pitt followers

were rather doubtful as to the outcome.
But from the time Lubic shot the ﬁrst
foul, it was seen that it was not the
same team that played the night be—
fore. Individual playing, team work,
enthusiasm; all were much more in‘
evidence and the ﬁnal score showed
the result. State’s victory over W. &
J., the night before, was an added in-
centive for victory.

Penn State proved as strong as ad-
vance notices said they were. Of the
ﬁve men playing for the up-state ag-
gregation, four were, veterans. and
for the ﬁfth, Blakeslee. no apology
need be given. It was Blakeslee who
kept them in the running by shooting
16 out of 20 fouls, after Parks had
missed the ﬁrst two free throws.

‘Jester. at center, was up to his old

tricks having ﬁve baskets credited to
him. Blakeslee. Walton, and Wilson
each caged one basket. -

_ Pitt started the game with the two
“Pinkies” in at forward; “Red” Hast-
ings and “Pink" Healey. The com-
bination is a hard ﬁghting one that is
not afraid to do a little guard duty.
Hastings shot two baskets. Healey,
shooting in hard luck, failed to se-
cure any. Matson, although pitted
against Jester. ‘grabbed four ﬁeld
goals. Pitt’s two guards, Capt. Och-
senhirt and Lubic, put up an exhibi-

tion that clearly marks them. as the

best pair of guards seen about here
for a long time. Besides holding the
opposing forwards to one basket, they
scored 23 of the team’s total points.
Twice Lubic caged the ball from the
ﬁeld, and once the “German Butcher”
leaving his post rushed ‘down, bellowed
lustily. and with one hand shot the
ball through the ring. Lubic further
distinguished himself, by making good
on 17 Out of 23 free throws.

This victory put Pitt in the lead in I

the- triangular championship contest
between Pitt, Penn State, and W. &
J.; Penn State having defeated W. &

‘~.J. the night before, at Washington.

GETTYSBURG ON CARD TONIGHT.

Carnegie, Juniata, and Penn State
all polished off in rapid bewildering
succession and placed upon the tobog-
gan through the efforts of the ﬁne
Italian like hand of the Pitt quintet
thrills with pride -and expectation all
the followers of the Blue and Gold
for sport—-pride in the ﬁnesse of the
work of the team thus far and expec-
tancy for a season of unusual success.’
Gettysburg is the next in line and
upon that team all eyes are focused
in an attempt to fathom. if possible
the puissant abilities of that particu-
lar combination of the indoor pigskin

' sport.

The prowess of this particular cor-

- relation of passers should not be

minimized by anyone even in the face
of the recent triumphs for the east-
erners seem to have become imbued
with something like the indominable
spirit that animated the wearers of
the Blue and Gray on the-ﬁeld which
bears the name of their college. In
the games that they have played thus
far this year they have shown magniﬁ--
cent form and team work, the most
notable of their feats being the hard
game they gave Lehigh on the home
floor of that team. Lehigh has one
of the strongest alignments of players

' in the State and the fact that Gettys-

«L

burg was able to hold them speaks.
meritoriously for the eﬂiciency of the
team from the Battle City.

Although this is not to be a league
game, Gettysburg is a member of the
Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Associa-
tion. This fact in itself is an ample
recommendation for any basketball
aggregation for the fOrmidableness_
of any of the unit teams of this league
is a well known fact.

take theﬂoor against this whirlwind
collection from across the mountains
had not been fully determined, but it

, is_thought that the opening’ shrill of

the whistle will greet something like

 . the "semen aggregation of men that

Looxluo ’EM OVER  

Now that, State’s out of the way,
.we have nothing to look forward to,
in the way of basketball; that is,
nothing but Lehigh, Army, Rutgers,
Lafayette, Allegheny, Tech, and W.
& J., and some more.
and forwards and center-—and at ’em!

While we have no prejudice against
patronizing home industry, we have to
hand it to Baker, Juniata’s center, for
one of the best exhibitions ever seen
in Trees gym. Baker measures about
ﬁve nine or ten, and must weigh at
least ninety-eight, with his heavy
clothes on; but he played his head off
and held Pitt’s three center even. It
is also worth while mentioning that
Baker is only eighteen years old, and
had played in just one varsity game
before the contest here last Friday.

.__0___

For joint holders of the world’s
championship at promoting heart fail-
ure, we cheerfully recommend Bigler
and Fees, forwards on that pesky
Juniata crew. Unless he’s half a mile
away from the basket, Fees doesn’t
consider a shot constitutional; while
Bigler has even less compassion. Pitt’s
lion-hearted guards had a mighty full
evening of it, watching those two.

“Andy” Hastings, in course of a
ferocious dribble, ran into a bunch of
State performers, three or seven in
number. Everybody in the bunch, ex-
cept “Andy,” got bumped. The ref-
eree called a foul on State, for having
too many men on the ball.

-___O__.

Making a guess. at it, it would ap-
pear that 'State this year has as team
at least as good as last year’s ﬁve,
and probably better; while our own
hopefuls seem to have improved in the
course of the twelve months. One
essential difference is that Pitt’s for-
wards are much larger than in form-
er years. It’s a good sized job to
cover a man of the size of Healey or
Hastings. ‘

Blakeslee started out in earnest
after a consecutive foul record, but
struck a snag after his seventh suc-
cessful attempt. His mark was a long
way from that set by Lubic last year
against Westinghouse, when he put in
sixteen without a miss. Lubic, by the
way, was in his best form of the seas-
on at shooting fromthe circle.

:_O._

We solicit help. on the following:

L. B. F. Dreamed a few nights ago
that he was dribbling the ball down a
ﬂoor half a mile long, a fourth of a
mile wide, with nobody to whom to
pass the ball, no goal at which to
shoot-—and Bob Peck» and Red Hast-
ings trying to take the ball away
from ‘him. He wants to know what
would be the proper thing to do. _

If we were subject to dreams like
that, we wouldn’t go near a bed.

;_o._:

The whole gymn was packed last
Saturday, with standing room at a
premium, because_ of the announce-
ment that, at some time during the
fuss, Captain “Butch” would present
his famous North Side yodel. “Butch”
disappointed his audience, however,
and wouldn’t yell a single note. If
this keeps up, we’ll have him im-
peached. \‘

Beginning with the Gettysburg
game, THE WEEKLY will keep count
of the “assists” in basketball games.
For the beneﬁt of the coeds, we might
say that an assist in basketball is of
the same family as the more famous
baseball play of the same name; that

‘ is, an assist is credited to the man

who made possible. a successful shot
for goal. ~With such ﬁgures in your
possession, it will be posible for you

- . todiscuss intelligently the tariff, cro-

quet, china painting, and civil serv-
ice reform. It may also help in unrav-
elling the Federal League tangle.

BIGGER" GAMES
I ARE SCHEDULED.

Keeping in mind that the Freshman
football squad of next year will be
under the -personal supervision of
Glenn Warner, along with the Varsity
team the management has laid a course
of trials for the new comers of next
season that might well make any
Freshman Hercules balk at the task
before him. For, according to the an-
nouncement given out this week Belle-
fonte Academy, Indiana Normal. and
Kiskimin-etas will be included on the
Freshman schedule. Following so
closely on the heels of the notice of
the‘ securing of the Penn game for the
Varsity, this announcement shows
that the Pitt athletics are on the climb.
There always has been an excellent
spirit between the University and the

 

Prep schools above’ named and to them .

Pitt is indebted for many of her
athletic stars. Bellefonte contributed
Smith, Dillon, Carlson, and Beattie;
Indiana Normal came forward  Al
Hart and Cliff Morrow; and Kiski has
given her Offering in the form of
Hastings, DeHart and Hockensmith.

, The Bellefonte game is to be played
on Forbes Field, October 9th, while
Wi1liamson’s men are giving the Navy
a battle. The adoption, of the one-
year rule will add greatly to the
strength of the Freshmen-in the next
two years, and it is expected that
these contests with the leading Prep
and high schools of the section will
tend to inﬂuence more of the gradu-

JUNIATNIS 
OEFEATEO BY  
  ONE POINT

Flushed with a victory Over Car-
negie Tech, Juniata’s crack basketball
team attacked the Panther’s lair last
Friday night, and it was only by the
hardest kind of playing that the locals
nosed out their opponents. The ﬁnal
count showed Pitt ahead by the scant
margin of one point, 28 to 27.

The game was marked by some ﬁne
individual starring, but the teamwork
at times was decidedly ragged. The
Juniata men were rather small,
physically, compared to the husky
Pittites, but they made up in spirit
what they lacked in ﬂesh. The two
forwards, Bigler and Fees, form a
pair that is hard to beat. Bigler was
all over the ﬂoor, helping in the team
work, besides shooting three pretty
baskets, two of which were almost
from the center of the ﬂoor. Fees, at
the other forward, besides getting
"three ﬁeld goals, shot 13 out of 16
tries from the foul line. Between the
two, they registered 25 out of the
team’s 27 points.

Fees started it by shooting a long
one from the center. Lubic shot a foul
and Bigler slipped one over the Pitt
guards. Juniata in the lead, played
hard, but a goal by Healey, followed
by another foul tied the score. The.
advantage swung back and forth
throughout the ﬁrst half. * First one
side would lead, only to be tied by
some brilliant shot of that other. As
the whistle blew, Fees caged a basket
which was disallowed by the referee,
the half ending with the locals in the
lead by the score of 13 to 12.

Pitt started the second half by se-
curing a ﬁve point lead. Flint then
substituted Carlson and McCollough.
Both men immediately broke into
scoring, "and when Captain Ochsenhirt
followed with a sensational one handed
shot, the locals seemed to be certain
of victory. Here the J uniata men took.
a brace and before they could be stop-
ped they slipped in three baskets and
Fees dropped in one from the foul
line. With only one minute to play,
Pitt was only _one point to the good.
However, no more scoring resulted
and the referee’s whistle ended the
supreme 7 Drfhiosvyb.hP,oO aatwas77i

FRESHMEN ALSO
COME THROUGH.

Not to be outdone by the Varsity,
the Pitt Freshman team turned in two
victories; one over the last year Fresh-
man team and the other Over the high
school team from Carnegie. ‘ ’

The game Friday night, with’ the
present Sophomore team was fast and
interesting. Great rivalry exists. be-
tween the two classes and "the-players
roughed it up considerably. The
second year men secured an early lead
but they were not able to keep up the
pace and the Freshmen soon passed
them. The ﬁrst half ended with the
Sophs in the rear by four points.
Again in the second half. the upper
classmen came back with a rush, but
the old “stuﬂ""‘ was not there, and the
game ended with the Freshmen at the
long end of the score, 28 to 26.

The game with the team from Car-

too much for the high school men.
Stahlman, Davis, and Nicholas starred
for the locals. In the second half
Coach Landis -put in four men whose

NET ENTHUSIASTS

PLAN TO ORGANIZE. ’

A meeting of the proposed tennis,-

association is called for Monday. Jan.§
25. at 11:30, in 105 Thaw hall, It is"
intended to complete the plans for or-
ganization of the association, to elect
officers, and to appoint the various
committees. I Several of Pittsburgh’s
foremost tennis enthusiasts are push-
ing the movement for University
courts and,‘ if the students will co-Op-
erate, success in securing the courts
is practically assured. All those who
have already given‘their names and
any others who are interested in pro-
moting the game here, are urged to be
present. It is planned to secure the
aid of the Athletic Committee and the
number Of_persons present will be an
important factor in presenting the
proposition.

GRID WARRIORS’
PICTURE TAKEN.

l A score or more of the letter men of
the 1914 football team gathered at
Breckon’s Studio last Monday after-
noon and were duly photoed and her-
tillioned after the most approved and
up-to-date methods. Two of the men
who earned their P’s were absent.
but barring that digression the task
was duly accomplished. The picture
which was taken on this occasion will
be the one that will b‘e framed and
hung upon the wall of the Track
House. The men who were entitled
to have their place in this picture have
full and just reason to be proud of
the distinction. They have not only in
their letters the badge of ‘meritorious
service done on one of the greatest
football combinations in the game, but
through their record and the picture
their accomplishments will be per-
petuated to the futureoteams as one
of the combinations that aided in the-
placing of Pitt on the football map.

GRAND.

All the attractions whch Mr. Harry Davis
announces for presentation in the Grand Opera
House this week beginning next Monday mat-
inee, Jan. 25. are star acts. In the list of

land on the globe and in the composite pro-
grams which they will give there will be an
artistic representation of every phase of vaude-
ville. Mlle. Adelaide and J. J. Hughes. the
representative American dancers. will be as-
sisted by Edward Davis in a repertoire of
dancing specialties that will run Terpsichore’s
gamut. Adelaide and Hughes were the stars
of the “The Passing Show” and various other
_- Shubert reviews. As La Petite Adelaide. this
fascinating danseuse ﬁrst endeared herself to
‘ -the American public in vaudeville and pan-
- tomime. She has been dancing. however. with
_Mr. Hughs for four or five seasons and they
have earned as great a vogue as a team as
she enjoys as a premiere.

 lowing doesn’t make a reading. It
, comes from M. W. Crosby, Football
V Manager at Erie high school, to Grad-
uate Manager Davis:
" “What you say regarding the treat--
, ment your fellows received when in
1 ,Erie last fall pleases me exceedingly.
The management and coach try to-im-
press upon our fellows an understand-
ing of the obligation they are under
to treat all visitors to our city with
the greatest courtesy and respect.
That our efforts in this regard are
fruitful, is gratifying in the extreme.
“Permit me to say, however, ‘that
we derive_ no less pleasure from your
visits to Erie than do you. Everyone
who witnessed the Pitt-Erie game last
season was impressed with the quality
of the football which your team played
‘and the clean, sportsmanlike game
‘which they put up. We are antici-
A ﬁating with pleasure your appearance
' ere next fall.” .
 ' «In addition to, their many courte-
 sies off the ﬁeld, Erie. handed the
.Freshnien a ﬁrst-classlicking on the
