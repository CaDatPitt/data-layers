New 04 ¢V/zen

Today ’s front page carries a stdry about the ﬁeld house of

the‘ University of Pittsburgh and the proposed plans for obtain-

ing a new one. According to University oﬂicials the hold-up in

. progress is caused by two factors: 1. present non-availability

of a suitable pre—fabricated, government—donated building, and

'2. lack of information as to whether the government intends to

_use for other purposes the choice hilltop area on which they
have an option.

.The government has been making‘ this decision for two
years. Perhaps, it has already been made and the government is
merely tardy invnotifying University ofﬁcials, or possibly, no
conclusion has been reached—we do not know. But we do know
that a University as large as Pitt rates adequate facilities for
athletics, including track, whether government aid is available
or not.

Pitt is fortunate to have in its student body such already-
famous champions as Herbie Dougles, Tommy Carr, Ed Sudzina,
Clarence Doak, Bill Morton, and others. While we Wait" for gov-

ernment action; these athletes struggle with inadequate equip-
ment to get in shape for spring competition. If the proposed
plansgfall through, Pitt may indeﬁnitely lose its chance for cham-
pionship track teams.

can Pitt aﬁ‘ord to depend on government action alone?

We believe that University oﬂicials owe it to the athletes,
the students, and Pitt itself to take deﬁnite, if necessary,‘
 independent’ steps toward providing this needed facility.

‘ 714% 3 gcience
Conversation around the Tuck Shops and other student gather-
ing places on ‘campus frequently centers itself on the University cur-
ricula and the requirements for the various degrees offered. In view
of this, we believe some of our readers may be interested in the

following editorial reprinted from the Texas Christian university
Skiﬁ: "

“ ‘One of the smartest men I knew went to college with
complete disregard for degree or grades—taking only those cours-
es he felt would be of use to him when he started‘ earning his .
living.’ A college graduate with a Master’s degree said this. He
also expressed the opinion that he would have been better oﬂz‘
had he done the same. b

“As it happens, a comparison of these two men'and what
they are now doing is simple. They both work for the same ﬁrm
in Fort Worth. The one without the degree has a mediocre job
U at mediocre pay and there isfevery reason to believe he will re-
main mediocre the rest of his life.

“The one with the Master’s degree is the head of the depart-
' ment. His future is a bright one. Then why does the college grad-
uate feel that way? Perhaps his subconscious is still resenting ’
, required courses, a topic under repeated ﬁre on campus fromwvets
hurrying to’ get out of school. Some of them will follow the course
of the ‘degreeless’ man.

“It is perfectly natural to resist requirements of this nature,
: and obviously a college degree assures no man that he will be
a success in life. But what‘ the college graduate, quoted above,
‘missed entirely is that the whole is made up of many parts.
Even though he is unaware of it, his degrees, with all their re-
quired courses, have given him mental stature he would not
have gained otherwise.”

(The Skiff, Texas Christian University).

Free Press
Guaranteed

At Colgate

“Universities need intelligent
self-criticism and student publi-
cations fall short of their full re-
sponsibilities when they fail to
-provide it,” spoke Everett Case,
president of Colgate university, in
guaranteeing Colgate’s publica-
tions complete freedom from fac-
ulty and administrative restraint.

The occasion of his address was
the 10-Oth anniversary of journal-
ism on C-olgate’s campus. His ad-
vocation of complete freedom of
the college press was one of the
first statements of its kind’ ever
issued by a university‘president.

“Colgate administrators a n (1
faculty members would not be'hu-
man if they did not at times wish
for more gentle. treatment than
is sometimes accorded them in
student publications. But. we at
Colgate do not, and will not, de-
mand it,” the president said.‘

“If, our publications are ,accur-

' I

tration and faculty will try to re-
gard their opinions, not as thorns
in the side, but as n-udges~in_ the
ribs -—l good, natured shoves in the
right direction students honestly
think we should go.” ~

Mr. Case emphasized that col-

I lege, editors -- all edi-tors ----carry

more _responsibility today than at
any time before in history, and
thatthis responsibility can be met
squarely only if the press is free,
with only the tenets of responsible
journalism as a guide.

These tenets of journalism, in-

Grove Direct Plays

The backgrounds of the directors -of the Pitt Players’ coming

productions are as varied and interesting as the plots of the three H

one—act plays which they are directing.
Norman Grove, director of “The House of Jukes,” helped di-
rect, “Waiting for Lefty,” one of last year’s shows, and played the

part of Fishkin in “Jim Dandy.”
“The House of Jukes,” a satire
on ‘hillbilly life, deals with a way-
ward son who Wants to get ahead.
He meets a schoolteacher who
tries tomake him a respectable
member of ;he community. The
conﬁict enters when he brings the
teacher home and introduces her
to his family as his future wife.

Th third act of Thornton Wil-
der’s “Our Town” is directed by
Perry J ubilirer, dancer turned di-
rector. Perry danced in the open-
ing show of “Best Foot Forward”
in New York and took part in the
Cap and Gown production, “Kil-
roy Is'Here.” ‘

“Our Town” is a philosophical

small town people, George Gibbs
and Emily Webb. They marry and

nine years later Emily dies. The
third act opens on Emily’s funer-

al scene. She later relives one day ,

of her past life,---, her twelfth
birthday. The acting is good and
the continuity, written by the Pitt
Players, reviews the important
action of the ﬁrst two acts so that
nothing is missed.

Bob Fitzpatrick, who directs.

“Happy Journey,” took part in
most of the Pitt Players’ produc-
tions of 1942 and l943..He appear-_
ed in “Abe Lincoln in Illinois,”
“Yellow Jack,” and “Knicker-
bocker Holiday.”

A light comedy ‘ staged com-.

pletely with-out 1 scenery, “Happy

Modern Design in Ads  

The artist in the ivory tower is a thin.g of the past. So is art
for art’s sake. .

With i.ts new exhibit on modern advertising art, the ﬁne'arts
department is out to prove this to the skeptics. The eight montages
in the new show were loaned to the University by the American Fed-
eration of Arts. The exhibit was prepared for the federation by the
Phillips—Exeter art department and the famed Addison Gallery of

“Creative design is re—shaping

the exhibit. The non-objective,
abstracit paintings which ‘the lay-
man scorns have not- been pro-
duced in a vacuum. As problems
in sheer design, the have laid the
foundation for new techniques in
advertising art. Today, good ad-

vertising is good design. 1
Six Illustrations

Six montages illustrate the
qualities of good design. The pri-
mary purpose of the ad is to at- -
tract the consumer, the exhibit
points out. A well-constructed

will incorporate words as part of
the “picture.
Through degrees of unit the ar-
tist finds his mode of expression
in advertising. One of his first
problems is position and direc-
tion. He isconcerned also with
the number’ and size of the design
elements, with proportion and or-
ganic or geometric shape, and
with the use of color for tonal
value and texture. A
Modern Designs .
“'I‘hro»ugh these basic princi-
ples,’ the last montages sums up,
“modern advertising art has de-
veloped. a new series of designs
and modern syrnbols.”'Incorporat-
ed in the i'llustrations are ads
from current magazines and sym-

The exhibit, open until Jan. 31,
ties in‘ with the department’s
course in advertising and news-
paper art, established this year to
correlate with classes in journal-
isam and advertising.

Instructor W. Reed Hastie ex-
plains, “In this studio course we
are trying to supplement and inte-
grate the theory learned in lecture
classes by giving students actual
art work connected with these
ﬁelds.” .

(Next on the line arts depart-
ment schedule is an exhibit pre-
pared by Syracuse university,
which will include the winners in

first of the new season—on Sat-

tions, they also claim, that in spite
of after-Christmas reducing plans,
they’re holding their Founders‘
Day dinner on the 25th.

The PiKA’s are really the popu-
lar boys these days with the so-
rorities. Come Friday, they will be
claimed by both the TPA’s and
Phi Mu’s. The TPA’s will ﬁll them
with tea in the afternoon, and the
Phi Mu’s intend to gorge them
with dessert in the evening. What
heavenly torture to be a PiKA!

Not to be outdone, the TPA’s
also will drown the Theta Chi’s
with tea on Wednesday. Incident-
ally, Theta Chi’s new big wheels
are: president, Jack O’Brien; vice-
president, Bob Swearingen; sec-
retary, Jack Kaercher; treasurer,

Four Pitt students have fea-
tured parts in a presentation of
“A Bell for Adano,”ithe adapta-
tion of John Hersey’s bo-ok being
given at the YMHA Playhouse,

Norman Rabinovitz, a pre—law

student, is taking the part of
“Zito,” and Paul Rogal, a pre-
med, is playing “Lt. Livingston,”
of the United States Navy. As
“Bastile G i o v a n n i,” Mervyn
Framer, Bus. Ad., will act the
part of a cartman. Pearl Toba-ch-
nik, a freshman in the College,
will be seen as “Margherita.”
V Tickets for both performances
are now available at the YMHA
information desk and the Play-
house oﬁice.

of them this week. By this we
don‘t mean that the majority of
them" will be going collarlesS—
It's just that their traveling secre-
tary, Louise. Richards will be here,
and they call her “Dickie”.

We like to hear more about
these active—alumn-ae meetings,
such as the Zetas had last Mon-
day. The subject discussed was
“Maturity.” (Hope the girls aren’t
worrying about growing up too
fast.) Zetas also are holding a tea
dance for the Delts Monday, and
are being entertained with more
tea by the ADPi’s this ‘ eek.

Tea, tea, tea! You’d think the
stuff was scarce the vvay the tra-
ternity world is going tor Lt these
days. The Sigma Chi’s (tea drink-
ers from way back) entertained
the Delta Zeta’s at the Metropoli-
tan “Y” or Wednesday. (We hope
they did, anyway.)

That day also found the Chi 0's
playing h.ost to the Phi Delts for
a dance. The actives of Chi Ome-
ga, pleased with tl eir pledges
(and always hungry), intend to
treat their young’uns to a din-
ner sometime before the semester

Backs Bonus

According to a United Press
sampling of the members of the
Pennsylvania State legislature
this week, indications were that
general sentiment l‘a\'ors a sol-
diers’ bonus financed or borrowed.

A few legislators

one legislator thinks that thestate
should set up a lottery for this
purpose. Others think that a bon-

us can only be financed by the

bond ‘issue method.
Opinion as to the amount of the
bonus. varies. It has been suggest-
ed that $l0 for each month over-
seas and $5 for each month in the
states, with a maximum payment
of $300 or $400. Most of the legis-
lators interviewed were in ap-
proximate agreement with thi
idea. 7

NATE APPLE .

For the past 13 years, dribble, hook-shot, foul, and “shoot two”
have been every-day expressions in Nate Apple’s vocabulary.

When Nate reached the ripe old age of eight, someone presented
him with a basketball. Since then, with the exception of his days at
Ford City High school, where the coach told him he was too short,
Nate has been tossing them through the hoops,
much to the disgust of opposing coaches. When
he came to Pitt it seemed as though the alma
mater was destined to not have his services. As a
freshman dent student, the young athlete was con-
tent with throwing the sphere around in gym class,
thinking all the time that he was still too short
for varsity basketball. One day Apple’s phys ed
instructor remarked that Nate showed signs of
real hoop talent. After a little encouragement and
coaxing, the diminutive courster, then in his sopho-
more year, joined “Doc” Carlson’s squad and
proceeded to grab a berth on the starting lineup.
A GENEVA THRILLER . _ _ . I .

Nate has experienced many thrills during his playing days
at Pitt, but just mention Geneva to him and watch his ‘eyes’ light
up‘. Back in his sophomore days the Panthers had a date with Gene-
va and it seems that, with three seconds remaining in the game,

 

mid-court. The gun went off as the ball out through the ozone; but
Nate_’s eye was good that night and Pitt went home with a 32 to
31 victory.

“I have played on a lot of good squads,” says Nate, “but this
year’s team is the best I have ever been ‘on. The boys really know
the Doctor’s system and with a little more experience the team is
going to go placs..” Apple has advanced from co-captain of last
year’s squad to. captain of this season’s ﬁve in this his last year at Pitt.

Nate seems to think that his most difﬁcult game was an early
match this season with the Whiz Kids of Illinois, and that his out-

NYU in a game played back in ’43.

Along with his school work and basketball, Apple is an alumnus
brother of Pi Lambda Phi fraternity, where, as an active a few
years back, he was outstanding in IF football and ping pong.

Nate found playing basketball and going to dental school a little
tough, so he plans to stick to his dental practice after graduation.
However, he said he might knock off work early a few days to play
a little friendly basketbal1—-probably a few hundred days if he al-
lows his love of the game to dictate his actions. °‘ -

The Pitt News ﬁve gained
an easy 31-10 victory over
what was laughingly referred
to as The Panther magazine
quintet.

However the slick paper
adherents did not leave empty
handed. They gained a moral
victory. For weeks prior to
the game, skeptics refuse’ to

believe that the Panther
could ﬁnd ﬁve men.

Fifteen spectators (rain
limited atteendance) were
pleasantly surprised when

ﬁve males took the floor for
the Panther. A clever Pan-
ther plot, to forestall the ar-
rival of several Pitt News key
players, failed to materialize.

Pitt News Editor, Tillie

the humiliation of defeat. She

Hoopmen Meet Geneva;

Seek Third

Victory

by John Golightly

Pitt will be striving for its ninth win in a row over Geneva
and third victory of the campaign tomorrow night at Beaver
Falls. But it will take a lot of striving!

The Panthers. are just recovering‘from a crick in the
neck brought about by Westminster’s towering Titans. The
compratively short Carlsonites spent most of the evening

looking up at six foot, four inche

Chet Dembinski and six foot, six-
inch Fred Paine.

Geneva is sure to give Pitt an-
other pain in the neck. Coach
Slim Rans-om will turn loose seven
cagers who top the six-foot mark.
Freshmen Johnny Rayz, Andy
Moraz, Warren Weakland, and
John Milich hit six foot, three
inches.

Milich’s ten point per game av-
erage makes him ‘top scorer. For-
ward John Harr tips in at six
foot, four inches." However, the
tallest man is veteran Center Bill
Jersey who stretches the tape to
sixrfoot, ﬁve inches.

A member of last year’s all-
State team, Dave Po-dbielski is a
modest six foot, one inch while
Chuck DeVenzio is a comparative
midget art ﬁve foot. eleven inches.

Dodo Canterna will be sidelined
for several weeks with a dislocat-
ed shoulder. "Wally Zernich will
replace him and pair with Captain

Nate Apple at the guard slots.

Fails As Pitt Loses

The good little man couldn’t beat the good big man. That’s
the story of Pitt ’s_ loss to Westminster at the stadium Monday

night by a 54-45 margin.

42-40. But Westminster’s halftime
advantage proved too great an
obstacle.

Pitt hopped off to a 15-10 first
period lead, then turned stone

.cold in the second period. Dodo
Canterna went out with a sep-

arated shoulder and shortly after,
Jack B-oose and Bill Cieply were
withdrawn as a protective meas-
ure. Both had three personals. _
’ Tlhis opened the ﬂood gates _for
the towering Titans and they
poured it on. Heddleston, Dem-
binski, Jones, and McLhinney to-
gether tallied 23,points to put the
New Wihnington ﬁve ahead, 33-

Sam David led the scorers with
16 points. Pu-gnacious Bill Mc-
Lhinney countered _15 for the Ti-
tans. However, tall Chet Dembin—
ski’s smooth court play sparked
the Titans all the way. He con-
tributed 11 tallies.

Jack Boose gave his best per-
ﬁorznance under the basket. It
showed in the scoring column
where he registered ten markers.

Despite the fact that Pitt
drew 30 fouls and Westminster
only 23, Titan supporters spent
the evening booing the officials.

For Edinboro

With but one week remaining
before the ﬁrst swimming meet
at Edinboro State Teachers col-
lege on Jan. 25, the Pitt natators
have been devoting long hours of
practice daily in preparation for
the strenuous water season ahead.

Meeting six days a week at the
Tree’s gym swimming pool, the
Panthers have reached top physi-
cal conditio-n according to Coach
“I-Ioward Waite. The boys show
lo-ts of stamina and have been

consistently improving the records
set at former practice sessions.‘
The squad will be comprised of
from 15 to 20 mermen when they
are engaged in intercollegiate
competition. At present, positions
remain wide open, but many like-
ly contenders have shown ﬁne
form and swift speed. Pa-ul Brug-
ger, of Erie, continues to pace the
ﬁeld of free-style swimmers.
Diving is a comparatively weak
spot on the Jungle Cats aqua-tic

‘ squad, but William Cochrane has

been consistently improving his
form and may develop into an ac-
complished diver by the time of
the ﬁrst meet.

Regardless of their inexperi-
ence, the swimmers are eagerly
looking forward to the starter
with Edinboro. .

 
 
 
  

   

Razzano Leads
YMCA Scorers

The statistics for the ﬁrst three
games that the Pitt YMCA has
played in the Metropolitan YMCA
basketball league reveal some in-
teresting data. -

For instance, newcomer Tony
Razzano, who has participated in
only one game, is high scorer. He
had 22 points in ‘the game against
the Allegheny Y. This is one more
point than runner-up Ed Shu-
maker has been able to garner in
two contests. John Kosh is third
with 15 points in two games.
Kosrh’s inability to score from the
foul line has proven costly. He
has made one foul in 14 attempts.
