Open Letter to
Those I 72 Service

Pitt News Office
Thursday Night
 November 4, 1943
f’_Hi There! ,
T We have just put the seventh issue of the Pitt News for
._g'this year to bed. As usual, we are glad that its done because
' we are tired—and hungry. And as usual, we are worried about
‘,1: how the paper will look when it comes out tomorrow. This
 7_week, we are particularly worried because this is your issue.
,,'And we did so want to make it a good one. '

 It is diflicult to write a letter at any time. But it is‘ par-
ticularly diﬂicult when you are writing to over 3,000 people",
_,_,fmost of whom you don’t even know. Yet we want you all to
J‘ '; feel that this issue of the News is along personal letter to you.
. {So we tried to write about things you’d all be interested
 in, namely, news about the University and news about each
'2 . other. '
 . Things are very different at Pitt now, you know. The most
 obvious change is, of. course, the fact that we _are now housing
 soldiers in the Cathedral and at Shadyside Academy. Yet that
 ,,*js not the only change you’d notice if you were to visit us. Like
* fthe rest of the world, we are living in a period of acceleration
§v_’~I‘f ‘and emotionalization. Every day, individuals and organizations
 have to change their programs ‘to suit wartime emergencies.
  Still weare trying to keep those things which are important
 -"to the meaning of Pitt. The structure’ of someof our programs
5»: may change, but we are holding fast to the ‘ideals which you
" ‘;-"and all University students have long cherished.

 ‘ Faculty’ members arenworking over time. Students’ are
 finding it more difficult than usual to study and work in activ-
 ities, but theyire doing it. We want you to feel sure that we are
;  not letting a war change what is the spirit behind Pitt. That
,4‘ would be letting you down. .

  ' It would be unfair for the’ News to take all the credit for
‘_<1_;h;is issue. Men’s Council "contributed money to help ﬁnance it,
and the YMCA relieved us of the task of mailing out your
.,.copies.’ To them, we owe thanks. And to the’ administrative
oﬁicers and to the deans of the various schools on campus,
'Iwe"'owe thankﬂ They were more than cooperative in giving
us’ information about and for you. They are really interested
in ‘you and what you are doing.» Needless to say, the students
werewilling to give us bits of information about you, a lot of
" which we‘ have included in the column on page,12. Even the
dffice1's and men of the military groups on campus were anxious
to tell their part of the story. 4
 Yes, we are tired tonight. But we are-happy. We have
-{done something foryou. Here’s hoping you enjoy it. ' ‘

Sincerely,

They say, the best is in the army
and the gravy’s in the navy but
they still manage to keep the in-
terest of quite a bit of the local
stuff! Chuck Page and \G_us Wilde
are keeping the town awake nights
with Melba Johns and Betty Ann
Crede. It should take them a good
week to rest up from their fur-
lough. ‘

Lt. Vince/Matera, in charge of
a ﬂeet of trucks where he is sta-
tioned, 'has Betty Mae Meyer’s
name painted all over the side of
one of them. '

Among the. triangles, and ‘there
seem to be ‘quite a few around
school the last week, is the ‘ Don

Sunseri who just reported back to
MIT on ‘Saturday. Don makes with
that ‘innocent expression and says
nothing, but he wasn’t too happy
about the whole thing.

Fred George, recently assigned
to the Philadelphia Naval Hospital
was disappointed when he was
home this week. He was sorry that
he hadn’t grown -another inch so
that he.could ask June Thomson

In the same class were Tom Moore, .
Herb Spencer, and, Elmo Harris
who’ are fast""becoming MacAr-

. In his addiess, “Thinking to a-
Purpose,” ’Rufus H. Fitzgerald,
Vice-Chancellor of, the University,
told graduates of the University of
Pennsylvania, at commencement
exercises-held October 30,’ that they
will be expected “to think through
the toughest ‘ problems —that  ever
faced a graduating? class.”

He also stated that "we will
have to give up (much of our free-
dom to fight a war. “But it islup’
I to each of us to understand the
worth of" the freedom we have sur-
rendered,” he stated, “and to get
it back when the war is over.”
. Even before the war, the United
States had given up many of its
freedoms. “Applied science brought
industry, and industry brought
cities of . great ‘population. The
greater the concentration of popu-
lation, the more of our freedom had
to be surrendered.

Marching takes up a great
part of the time of Army men
stationed at Pitt. They march
from building to building for
classes, always ‘singing as
they go. Favorite songs are
“The Army Air Corps Song”
and “I've Got Sixpence.”

Here is a scene, ‘very close

and running back down
doesn’t do the appetite any
harm. Pitt Army men are

At a special meeting of all Uni-
versity pre-meds last Friday, Dr.
W. D. McElroy, dean of the School
‘of Medicine spoke on the pre-medical
men's standing with the medical
schools of the country and their
-military connections with the A-12
and V—12 government programs._ A

In brief, the situation as they ex-
plained it is as follows: _. _

Classes in the nation’s' leading

have already been ﬁlled. In 1945,
80%’of each scho'ol’s classes will
‘be ﬁlled by the government--45%
by the Army, 25% by the Navy.
This 80% quota will be ﬁlled with
_pi:ospective medical menvin the
I services who have already ﬁnished
. their pre training and pre‘-meds

-,who‘ are now completing _ their

,_training under the AST program.

The remaining 20% of themed-
" ical students for 1945 will be tak-

en from the civilian students now

in college. ' 2 ..

. ‘Students inducted into the service
should carry their college creden-
tials with them to the reception cen-
ter. Screening tests will be given
at "the reception centers, and induct-
ed 'men may_ qualify for the pre"
medical -, government , training
through th_ese tests.‘ -  - . .

In the Army, after satisfactory.
completion ‘of the receptionlcen-,
ter -screening tests‘, and inter-
views, approximately 4500 -men

Dr. William R. Van Dersal, grad-
uate assistant in biology at the
University of Pittsburgh, is now
director of personnel in the United
States Conservation Service.

After receiving his Ph.D. here,
he left the University to take over
his present position. Within the
last few years he has written‘ two
books, the ﬁrst of _which is “Orna-
mental American Shrubs,” which
was favorably received and re-
viewed by the leading botanical
societies.

His’ most recent publication is
entitled “The American Land”
and is being published by the Ox-
ford University Press. In this
book, Dr. Van Dersal traces the
development of the land from the
Vikings up to the present time.
In so doing he traces the original
natural resources of the country,
their present conditions for use
and abuse, and trends for modern
conservation. ' '

A plan which he presents in his
book has been introduced and ac-
cepted by many rural areas. It is
to do away with square ﬁelds, and,
instead, plow the land into contour
strips and bands. This allows water
to soak into the soil and ‘Will not
only produce a greater ‘yield, but
also prevent soil erosion. Another
of the points which he develops is
that a farmer may get better yield
from the land by planting hybrid
corn. This corn gives a better yield,
having more and larger ears on
each point.

At the‘ present many of Van
Dersal’s plans are in use on Amer-
ican farms.

War, someone once said, is a
great leveler. Proof of that may be
found in the Stadium tomorrow
iwhen Pitt and Ohio State meet on
comparatively equal terms. For it
was only last year that the Buck-
eye powerhouse eleven smashed the
fvlhapless Panthers 59-19 as they
" marched on to the Big Ten Cham-
7 pionship titla» ’
 But things are different this

year, for Ohio State, like Pitt, is an
‘ Army school. And this, translated
1/into football, means 17 year olds,
4F’s and deferred men. Judging
~..  the records, Pitt should have
 (the edge, for the Panthers show a
Vbnlanced book of three and three

against the one win and ﬁve losses
_ the Buckeyes have collected. How-
ever, West Virginia, Bethany, and
I ..,Carnegie Tech are not to be classi-
vﬁed with Iowa Pre-Flight, North-
rwestern, Purdue, Great Lakes, and
“Indiana, the schools -contributing
[the Ohio losses.

 -Pitt and some 35,000 fans are
Kdxpected to ‘be on hand for the
rggme. Ohio State is conceded an
fldvantage in personnel, for they
ihtve two great backs ‘in Ernie
Parks and Dean Sensanbaugher.
1'itt’s chances, therefore, depend
glhrgely on how well they can stop
those two boys.

The Panthers spent this week
‘killing on defense, for the theory
‘ ilthat they will know what to do
 the ball when they have it.
The i_mportant thing is to see that
  Buckeyes don’t have it—at

least, not for very long. _

_, "Reserve center, Don Fisher was
.  only casualty in the Carnegie
’‘ "Tech game. He suffered a shoulder
-Lﬁjury and did not work out with
willie team the early part of the
fweek, but he is ﬁured to be able to
 some action Saturday.

_Center Ralph Hammond will cap-
 the Panthers for the second

time this season tomorrow. Ham-
mond led the team in their 20-0
victory over West Virginia.

For Pitt, Joe Pierre will be at

‘left end. The right end position will

-fall either to Jim Maloney‘ or Paul
Massey. Maloney is a good pass
ocatcher, but Massey, who has been
doing most of the kicking, holds an
edge on defensive play. At tackles
will be Mal Ebert and Jim Reber.
Fran Mattioli will be at left guard
with George Ranii teaming up on
the other side of the line. However’,
there is a possibility that little
Steve Polach, 165 pounder from
,Uniontown, will beat Ranii out for
the right guard spot. I

At center will be game captain
Ralph Hammond. Joe Mocha will
start at quarterback with Joe Kielb
and John Foley backing him up.

Although Bethany gained only
nine yards through Pitt's forward
wall and Carnegie Tech netted a
minus four yards, the foes have
gained 798 yards by rushing while
the Crimson and White clad eleven
made 760. The bright spot of the
1943 edition of the Panther squad

times while the locals racked up 25

through the air and have succeeded
1.7 times. This nets an av'ei'age of
35 per cent.

The net total yardage compiled
shows the Panthers with the advan-

tage, 1561 yards to 1408 for the 2‘

 ‘There must have been a very deep feeling of shame
afriong the Pitt students who attended the game last Saturday.
,;Tliere was shame for .the number of unoccupied seats and,
ih‘os?t" of all, shame for the emptiness of the platform where
thjé.‘.P-itt band should have been and was _not. Four people—the
liand managers——sat in the place set aside for forty-ﬁve. The

9 7}--Pitt"team won the game on the ﬁeld, but Pitt-lost something.

 . ‘ so /
;”The dissolution of the Pitt band is, in itself, shameful.
Just four weeks ago, the band was launched with considerable
fanfare. The bandmen were eulogizedi and congratulated for
their courage and ﬁne school spirit. Unfortunately, the pub-
licity did more harm than good. For,1ev1d.ently, some of . the
boys became so imbued wtih .their own nobility and self—sacr1-
ﬁee that they no longer considered practice or. cooperation
necessary.» Twenty/out of forty-ﬁve neglected to come to the
 " ;practice a week.

that could be called a football team only‘ in the loosest sense of
fthelwords, supported that team with a fervor that would have
do,’ne.credit’ to a Rose’ Bowl entry. They. ﬁlled their student
section. ‘And they had a band that not only played during the
‘game, but one that put on a halftimeshow as-well. It -is well
toﬁtiilremember at this point, that any excuses about wartime
‘ ofiditions, ~etc_., godoubly for Carnegie Tech. _
_ jflt has become too much a custom at Pitt to give Carnegie
Tech Ia resigned paton the back, i. e. “I don’t know‘ why, but
 really have spirit over there?’ Maybe the time has come
.to”ﬁnd out why—and then to do something about it.
There is little to be said about last week’s game, save that
j:he'Tar.t.ans were as game and willing as they were weak and
'iii_ept.‘Despite the ﬁnal 45-6, count,‘Pitt made no effort to run
p’,~ja.= score, for they -used their third and fourth teams the
greater part of -the game and curtailed the ‘passing. The
‘Panthers we're headed for their third shutout ‘triumph until

With soldier games expected to
ﬁll up most of the practice sessions,
before the season begins and also
during the season, the “Little Scor-

reminiscent of last,year’s “Rinky-

an injured leg and is not expected
to report for practice until some-
time later. Walt Jones, second and

more to -stress the cooperation of
