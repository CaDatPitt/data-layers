who went on that trip worked to reclear a trail

Popcorn burns diets,

Would knowing that movie the-
ater popcorn has almost the same
caloric content as three Big Macs
prevent you from ordering ev-
erybody’s favorite showtime
snack?

Probably not.

But maybe you’d eat less of
it.

According to Bloomberg
News, movie theaters are ﬁghting
a federal requirement for nutri-
tion labels on their popcorn —
which contain as many as 1,460
calories, more calories than a Big
Mac meal with a medium fry and
a medium Coke. The requirement

spawns from a provision in the .

health care law requiring chain
restaurants with at least 20 U.S.
locations to list caloric contents
on" their menus. According to
the article, around 30 percent
of movie theater annual revenue
comes from food sales.

Although we think labeling
popcorn is a positive measure,
we think that at some point la-
beling has to end and personal
responsibility has to begin.

For one thing, labeling can
be deceptive. Many products list
calories per serving size instead
of per package — even though
most people typically eat the en-
tire package. For example: Pop-
Tarts come packaged in pairs, but
the nutritional label is based off
a one—pastry serving size. This
can be misleading to consumers
who only glance quickly at the
calorie count and neglect to read

could use labels

. .

the serving size.

In addition, a calorie count
on movie theater popcorn might
not be accurate since the same
amount of butter is not consis-

tently applied to each serving. A

Even the calorie counts for Sub-
way sandwiches are listed sans
cheese and condiments.

Basically, it’s pretty easy for
restaurants to convince consum-
ers that what they are eating isn’t
actually that unhealthy.

Even though labels should
allow people to better practice
moderation, we aren’t sure that
movie theaters would actually
have to worry about a decrease
in popcorn sales.

According to MSNBC, re-
searchers from the Duke National
University of Singapore found

that letting consumers know how '

many calories are in their food

might do little to change their '

eating habits. .

‘ It seems to us that ignorance
is not the problem but instead a
sedentary society with a palate
accustomed to calorie—dense but
nutrient-void foods.

MSNBC reports that the aver-
age American attends six movies
a year. That’s far less frequently
than the average American eats
out at a restaurant. So as long as
you aren’t going to the movies
multiple times a week, splurging
on a little high—calorie popcorn
isn’t that big of a deal. Just con-
sider getting a smaller size or
splitting it with some friends. I

disappointing when you consider I get
updates on the status of John Boehner’s

Cut off from my Supply of fresh Biden,
I recently found myself spending more
time at Celebrity Baby Princess (celeb-
ritybabyprincessii.blogspot.com), my
favorite celebrity-baby blog, rather than
looking up information about Biden’s
quartz Omega Seamaster watch (a real
classic) or researching Biden’s favorite
food (Italian). These were dark days,
indeed. -I

So you canimagine my glee when I
learned Biden paid a visit to another po-

. litical favorite: Russian Prime Minister

“President” Vladimir Putin.“

Like Biden, Putin is an all-time favor-
ite of mine. I love Putin for his wit, his
ﬂagrant media—wh*ring and his open and
unapologetic thirst for power. -

Another thing I_ love about Putin: He
likes to publicly humiliate other politi-
cians and dignitaries. '

Thus, as can only be expected with
these two, there was an ample supply of
gaffes by Biden and_ audacious‘ camera-
seeking behavior from Putin. All in all,

Always savvy, Putin reportedly ap-

Pokemon’s legacy reﬂected in ‘Black’

Randi Alu
For The Pitt News

With the recent U.S. release of “Poke-
mon Black” and “Pokemon White,”
and their refreshingly back-to-basics
color schemes, a question emerges: Is
the classic game forever changed —
are the differences between the past
games and present edition as stark as
the contrast of black and white?

In short, no. Not surprisingly, the
new Nintendo DS edition falls short
of the rumored complete overhaul.
After all, Nintendo has a pretty sweet
setup thathasbeen rakingincash since
1996. Although we fans complain that
the game is the same each time, Idon’t
thinkwe would really be comfortable
knowing that our beloved childhood
fantasyworld of “Pokemon” had been
drastically altered. .

What has changed is fairly pre-
dictable. As expected, graphics have
improved, the third—personviewpoint

has angled more, and perspective is
visually stimulating — the ground
moves more realistically as the avatar
responds to commands. Battles and
Pokemon, as well, are far more detailed
in appearance and movement.

The characters, whereas their ages
arenever speciﬁcally mentioned, have
more of a teen-angsty feel, perhaps
to cater to those of us who grew up
with the game and are now budding
into ‘adulthood. The avatars and game-

A controlled characters look physically

older as well — although still very
age—ambiguous, so as not to alienate
an age group.

In fact, one of the player’s two ri-
vals starts off her journey by arguing
with her father, an experience many
of us college students have encoun-
tered. The same rival later expresses
her anxiety about what she’s going to
do in life — another concern of older

When you think West Coast versus
East Coast, do you think rap feuds,
sports grudges  or burger-joint
battles? If you’re familiar with the
Five Guys Burgers and Fries versus
In-N- Out Burger debate, your an-
swer is most deﬁnitely the latter.

Boasting the same red and
white motif —— respectively in
checkers and palm tree patterns
—— and the same fast food—centric
offerings, one might initially haz-
ard that the feud is grounded in
geographical affinity, like Sheetz
versus Wawa. But was your food
columnist going to leave this myth
unexplored when her spring break
brought her to California? No,
dear reader, she was not.

The Californians’ fries are cut

ployee peels the potatoes, then an-
other shovels them into a contrap-
tion that instantly slivers them

is a skinless, pale, lightly fried fry
that’s nearly raw in the middle and
very lightly salted.

Five Guys fries are larger — al-
most more akin to a potato wedge
than a fry —- and cooked with the
peel intact, resulting in a meatier
and crisper product. The employ-
ees also salt their fries liberally.

which is better 4 the two virtu-
ally could not be at more opposite
ends of the french fry spectrum,
and thus cater to different tastes.
But what of the mea1’s centerpiece,
the burgers themselves?

In perfect honesty, both are de-
licious. In-N- Out’s are very much
on the thin side, however, encour-
aging the ordering of double or
triple patties, which brings us to

our next point of comparison:
menu options.

In-N- Out boasts a much-vaunt-
ed “secret” menu of customization
options not listed on the board
and thus only available to those in
the know. The most famous might
be the Animal Style option, which
includes Thousand Island spread,
mustard grilled patties and extra
pickles. The Animal Style fries are
served with cheese, Thousand Is-
land spread and grilled onions.

After that, the customizations
veer into the insane: Orderyour
burger cut in half, or on an un-
toasted bun, or with chilies, or any
permutation your heart desires
of the beef patty—to-cheese—slice
ratio —— four by four being a fa-
vorite among those with unhinge—
able jaws.

Ironically, the only request, in
my experience, that In—N-Out em-
ployees will absolutely not honor
is Pittsburgh’s most famous sand-

There is also the requisite evil “Team” that
the player encounters, as in the previous games.
This time, Team Plasma is concerned with the
capturing and enslaving ofPokemon, avalue that
is at the very core of the “Pokemon” universe.
Unfortunately, Team Plasma seems virtually
indistinguishable from the “Teams” found in
the other games, such as Team Rocket or Team
Galactic. . V . V

' In past generations, certain Pokemon would
only be available in one version. In “Black” and
“White,” -however, this is taken a step ﬁuther,
as each version has a completely separate area
that is not_in the corresponding game: “Black”
has “Black City,” a city j; , ere extremely strong
trainers reside, and  “White For-
est,” a place where exotic Pokemon_ can be en-
countered. .. V H V

Fortunately, “Pokemon” has always been sin-
gularly intriguing. Whereas the plots are facile,
the gamespace is astonishingly complex for the
teclmology it’s created for. The “map” of any given
“Pokemon” game isvery large, with cities having

their own personalities, which are suggested by A

color and music. There are eight main cities, to
be precise, with eight badges to collect from the
gym leaders. This structure has been the same

In fact, the two versions were, when combined,
the best—selling game injapan lastyear, and sold

5 million units in record times for DS games, ac- ' ‘

There are several other indications that Poke-

If Five Guys boasts any such secret menu,
I am unaware of it. In anycase, I am not go-
ing to suggest that you aggravate the ﬁne

er'n’ploye'es of Pittsburghsandwich shops

with tricky nonmenu orders, and for heav- ‘ _

en’s sake don’t bother them with anything
outrageous during the lunch rush. At the
same time, you never know what order op-
tions might be possible until you ask.

little to offer those‘ of a vegetarian orgvegan

Wish Burger —- folk knowledge claims -

the name originates from “I wish there
were meat in this burger” — which con-
sists of hand—leafed lettuce, sliced toma-
toes, onions, pickles and Thousand-Island

. spread.

Five Guys does offer vegetarian options
like grille cheese, but there are no vegetar-
ian burgers listed on its online menu.

i The polaropposite of vegetarianism is
In-N—Out’s Flying»Dutc’hman —— two slices
of cheese melted between two burger pat-
ties. The restaurant’s “protein style” caters
tolanother realm of dietary preferences:
patties and ﬁxings wrapped in lettuce.

The actual construction of an indi-
vidual burger probably has much more to
do with the employee on shift than with
the franchise, but over the course of my
ﬁeld research it’s beeni_my experience that
In-N-Out burgers tend to be messier, pos-
sibly because they are cased in wax paper
pouches rather than tinfoil.

Will we ever see In-N-Out Burgers in the

rant is a cultural phenomenon worth a try

Panthers win EWL tournament, prepare for NCAAS

The Pitt wrestling team celebrates its EWL tournament championship in Bloomsburg, Pa. Seven members of the team qualiﬁed for the NCAA championships that begin Thursday.

Mike Furlong
Staff Writer

It’s been ayearﬁill of milestones for the
Panthers wrestling team, a list that got even
longer over spring break.

The Panthers pulled in theirﬁrst Eastern
Wrestling League individual tournament
championship to cap an impressive year in
league wrestling that saw them win the regular
season title as well.

,, Six Panthers wrestlers won their weight
class en route to 132.5 team points, topping
second—place West Virginia by 16 points.

“We did a pretty good job,” Pitt head coach
Rande Stottlemyer said. “We put seven guys
in the ﬁnals. Six of them were able to win. We
also were able to win ourbouts againstwest
Virginia, our closest competition.”

Redshirt senior Ryan Tomei highlighted
the day for the Panthers by winning his second
consecutive title as well as being named the
tournament’s Co—Outstanding Wrestler along
with Clarion’sJames Fleming. Tomei also won

. the award in last season’s EWL Uoumament.

At the heavyweight class, Tomei picked up
an 8-2 victory in the ﬁnals over Bloomsburg’s
Zac Walsh. .

“Tomei really does a pretty good job at
what he does,” Stottlemyer said. “It’s one of

9 those things that is a nice honor, but I know he’s
looking forward to the next thing, which is the
NCAAs. He’s lookingto right the ship after not

‘ havingthebestexperiencetherelastseasonf’

Possibly the biggest tournament surprise
was redshirt freshman Danejohnson, who
won the tournament at 149 pounds. Johnson
defeated two returning All-Americans on his
way to his ﬁisttoumament title.

“There’s no two ways about it, Dane had an
exceptional day,” Stottlemyer said. “He beat
two guys that he has lost to before that are .
both All-Americans. You really could argue for
Dane to be the tournament OW [Outstanding I
Wrestler] .”

In the semiﬁnals,_]ohnson won a 5-3 decision
over Torsten Gillespie of Edinboro, a 5th—place
ﬁnisher at the NCAA championships last season
as well as athree—t1'me national qualiﬁer:

In the championship bout, Johnson defeated

I redshirt senior Brandon Rader ofWest Virginia

by a 3-1 score. Rader is a two-time All—American
who placed sixth inthe NCAAs in 2006 and
2007. ’

The tournament was awelcome—back‘ ‘
performance for junior Zac Thomusseit, who
sat out for much of the season with a knee
injury. Thomusseit, who is still ranked No. 5 in
the naﬁon at 197 pounds, won all three of his
matches on his way to his second consecutive
EWL title.

“Itwas nice to get back on the mat,”

‘Thomusseit said. “I had never been out that

long in my career. To be able to get back and
compete was great. I felt like my knee was close
to 100 percent. It was just my conditioning that
wasn’t quite there yet.

Redshirt junior Tyler Nauman won his third
EWL title after a dominating16—0 technical
fallvictory in the semiﬁnals, followed by a 6-4
victory over Matt Bonson of Lock Haven in the
championship bout.

At 165 pounds, redshirt junior Ethan
Headlee won his ﬁrst EWL title after a 6-0
championship victory over Donniejones of
West Virginia. .

Overall, the Panthers placed nine of 10
wrestlers in the top four at the tournament. '

The Panthers had seven wrestlers earn _
automatic bids to the NCAA championships to
be held in Philadelphia beginning Thursday.

Anthony Zanetta earned an automatic bid
and will wrestle against No. 10 Alan Waters of
Missouri in the opening round.

Nauman will go to the NCAA championships
for the third time and will take onjosh Kindig of
Oklahoma State to open the. tournament. Kindig
is a two —time Pennsylvania state champion who
wrestled for Blue Mountain High School.

“I don’t really know too much about
[Kindig] ,” Stottlemyer said. “I do know that
Tyleris looking forward to the match. The two
of them only live about an hour away from each
other, but they have never trained together or
anything like that.”

Johnsonwill make his ﬁrst NCAA
championship appearance and will take on No.
6Jason Chamberlain of Boise State in the ﬁrst
round.

‘This season, Dane had a lot of close one-
point losses,” assistant coachjason Peters said.

“I think after last weekend he has ﬁnally gotten
over the hump. Ithink he’ll give guys at NCAAs a
lot of trouble.”

Thomusseit will return to the NCAA
championships for the second time after
winningtwo bouts last season. Thomusseitwill
wrestle Matt Casperson of Boise State in the
ﬁrst round. Casperson fell to the Panthers’ Matt
Wilps last season by a 5-4 score.

“My goal is to win a national title,”
Thomusseit said. “IfI fall short of my goal, I will
still have the opportunityto be an All-American;
if I set my goal short to just be anAll—American,
iflfallshort I’llhave nothing.” '

Tomei will also make his second appearance
and will take on Brendan Barlow of Kent State in
the opening round. Tomei defeated Barlow 6-5
in a dual meet earlier this season.

‘Atthis point, we expect Ryan to win every
match,” Peters said a few weeks ago. “I  he
will be an All—American, but our goal is for him
to be the national champion.” '

On top of the 282 national wrestlers to
earn automatic bids, 48 wrestlers had the

opporuinity to be selected for an at-large bid.

Overall, the Panthers hope to carve out a
spot in the tournament as a premier wrestling
Program-

“This is going to be the craziest tournament
that you’ll see,” Stottlemyer said. “Every
round isgoingto be tough with a lot of upsets.
Hopefully we are one of those teams ahead of
the curve that’s going to win some. These guys
have been lookingforward to itall year.” I

TONY’S TOP 10

Tips for ﬁlling out your NCAA

  

Senior Staﬂ” Writer

After ﬁve months of fans and analysts
arguing over who should make the NCAA
Tournament and which teams should

be seeded where, fans ﬁnally found out .
-these details on Sunday night.

Now, over the next few days, millions
of Americans will spend countless hours
ﬁlling out brackets. So for my Top 10 ‘
this week, I give you 10 _ways to ﬁll out
your bracket. '

10. Me_rit. Sure, you could. ﬁll out your
bracket based off which teams you think
are better, but where’s thefun in that‘?
Choosing winners based on the quality
of the teams is difﬁcult, and many teams
play over their heads in the tournament,
whereas others underperform. I advise
you to use one of these other methods —

especially if I’m competing against you A . ’

in a'pool. —

9. Seeds. Choosing the higher—seeded
team in each matchup is obviously a
boring way to fill out a bracket. But
believe it or not, the higher seeds
typically win — that’s why they’re the
higher seeds. Actually, if you chose
based off seeds, you would have done
pretty well in 2008 and 2009.

8. Pedigree. If you pick winners based
on which teams have success in the
NCAA Tournament, you might actually
do pretty well. Old Dominion has pulled
off a few stunning upsets — such as
beating Notre Dame in the first round
last year —— and Pitt is susceptible to
upsets in March. And you might just look
like a genius if you pick Michigan State

0 to make it to_ the FinalFour.

7. Gut. You could simply go with your

gut for each game. This could be reliable’ ,

if your gut is really knowledgeable about
college basketball. But be careful so you
don’t confuse a gut feeling with a gut-
wrenching feeling. I know_Pitt would
likely beat Butler or O1diDominion, but ‘
the thought that Pitt could lose to Old
Dominion gives me a gut-wrenching
feeling —— which I might be confusing for
a gut feeling that Pitt ‘will get upset.

6 .‘ Colors. What’s your favorite color? .
Choose the winners based on the answer
to that question. You might not do very
well in your bracket pool, but it would '
be fun to see how many games you pick
correctly. You’ll probably do much better

if your favorite color is blue, as opposed

Tournament br

acket

to orange.

 . Education. Since these players are

student—athletes, why not make out your
bracket_based on which school is better
academically? Hint: Princeton would go
to the Final Four.

4 . Size. While we’re looking at the
actual schools, let’s pick the winners
basedon the size of the schools.

Pitt would go prettyfar, but Texas
would probably take home the crown.

‘ Considering-that Texas actually , 1 I

has a legitimate shot at a national; . I _
championship, this might not be'T-a’ bad
method. I “:0; H ‘ I - N 

3. Copy someone. Watch ESPN’s
Bracketology special, decide which
analyst you like best and copy him.

I might copyjay Bilas, since he won
some brownie points with me when he
questioned if the Selection Committee
knew that the ball was round. I

2 . Mascots. Imagine if panthers
actually faced off against bulldogs? Not
only would it be entertaining, but the
Panthers would undoubtedly win. In
fact, Pitt would go pretty far based off
this method, but the NCAA Tournament
would easily come down to the Michigan
State Spartans versus the St. John’s Red
Storm. But I’m not sure if a Red Storm
would defeat a Spartan, since I’m not

7 sure what a Red Storm is, although it

sounds pretty ﬁerce.

1. Do they have a Kemba? I know
you’re probably trying to forget about
it, but did you see what Kemba Walker
did last week‘? He put his Connecticut
team on his back and won ﬁve games
in ﬁve days to take home the Big East
tournament championship. Players like
Walker often step up big time in the
NCAA Tournament and lead teams to big
wins. It wouldn’t be crazy to see Jimmer
Fredette and BYU against Connecticut in
the national championship game.

Certainly, if you_actually choose to
stick with one of these methods to ﬁll
out your bracket, you would probably
fail miserably. That’s why I advise an
11th option: all of the above. I have no
idea whether UN LV or Illinois will win,
but I know” that a Runnin’ Rebel would
probably beat whatever the heck an Illini
is, so I’m going to have UNLV moving
on in my bracket. But my gut tells me .
UNLV will probably lose to Kansas in the
second round.

Find your own happy medium, have
some fun and good luck. j
