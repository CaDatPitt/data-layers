Two major facility improve-
ment projects will begin shortly in
and around Pitt stadium, adding
to the university’s image of a
0 “big-time” athletic institution.

A new surface, called Super-
turf, will be laid on the stadium
floor in time for the Fall football
schedule, replacing the present
Astroturf carpet. The present turf
has been down for four years and
has worn thin in spots, according
to Assistant Athletic Director
Walter Cummins.

“You usually get just a little
better wear out of it than that,”
Cummins said. “‘The entire sur-
face will be new because so much
of it was basically down to the
threads. With intramurals being
played on there and practicing on
the outlying areas, they’ve gotten
a lot of use of the turf that was

   
   

olllce complex.

in there.”

The stadium field and track
will be closed to all activities un-
til Aug. 9 due to the resurfacing.

Outside the stadium, the con-
struction between Gates 2 and 3
of a new athletic department of-
fice complex will begin soon.

The complex will ultimately
house most of the administrative
functions of the athletic depart-
ment including Sports Informa-
tion and the Golden Panthers.

The construction will cause the
closing of Parking Lot D, a per-
mit only lot that normally holds
40 vehicles. The Lot D permit
holders have been relocated to the
O’Hara Street garage, according
to Janet Thomas of the Univer-
sity Parking Office.

Parking regulations will be
strictly enforced on the sidewalk

surrounding the stadium during
the construction. Violators will be
faced with a ticket totalling
$32.50 in fine and costs.

Lot D will remain closed
throughout the football season,
but Thomas thinks the lost park-
ing spaces will not cause any ma-
jor problems.

“We have been able to take
care of most of the people who
would normally park there on a
normal home game Saturday,”
Thomas said. ‘‘I do not think it
will cause us much of a prbolem
although the total number of
spaces on the upper campus will
be reduced.”

The complex is scheduled to be
completed in December ‘I983.

Posvar, Council
Discuss Computers

By ERIK SCHWER
Computers were once again a main
topic of discussion at the Senate
Council Monday.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar said a
number of new proposals have been
made to Digital Equipment Corpo-
ration (DEC) concerning new com-
puter enterprises for the university.

The university is considering pur-
chasing 50 to 100 new CRT termi-
nals and looking into an agreement
between Pitt DEC that would pro-
mote co-research cooperation, he
said. Carnegie-Mellon University
and IBM have a similar
arrangement.

The co-research agreement would
provideapproximately $5 million in
university funds in exchange for new
machines and equipment from
DEC.

Posvar also said that an on-
campus personal computer store for
faculty and staff will be established
by mid-September. The store will be
in a university-owned building and
stocked by private ﬁrms. Posvar did
not say, however, whether the store
will be available for student buvers.

Posvar said he was pleased with
the outcome of the meetings con-
ducted in Washington, D.C., last
week with various education and
bu_s_iness leaders. Posvar, who is a

member of the Business-Higher
Education Forum, and the rest of
the committee discussed economics,
industry and international competi-
tiveness with President Reagan.

The Reagan Administration is
now considering a 20 percent
increase in the National Science
Foundation funds and a $300 mil-
lion increase in available capitol for
basic collegiate research. The
recommendations the committee
made stemmed from a 16-page
report.

In other business:

0 Posvar said the university has
contingent plans if the state budget
is delayed. The budget is expected to
be approved by July 1.

OPittsburgh will host the yearly
meeting of theNorthwestern Urban
Colleges beginning Sept. 11, 1983.

0The senate discussed the contro-
versial New Keys Policy proposal.
Pitt’s security department and the 52
separate building safety committees
are currently trying to develop the
new system. The final results should
be made public in the near future.

0Finally, at the start of the meet-
ing, Posvar congratulated the 25
newly elected members and repre-
sentatives to the senate. Senate pres-
ident Richard Tobias was re-elected
for another term.

Soviet Lecturer

ComesToPittsburgh~

is it possible to avoid a nuclear
confrontation between the U.S and
the U.S.S.R.?

A Soviet lecturer from Moscow
expressed his view on this subject

‘during his visit to Pittsburgh last

week. He was one of twenty guests
from the Soviet Union who par-
ticipated in a goodwill exchange mis-
sion coordinated by the American-
Soviet Friendship Society.

lldar Aktamzjan, a lecturer at the
Moscow State institute for interna-
tional Relations, expressed hope
mixed with frustration regarding the
talks in Geneva to limit the produc-
tion and deployment of nuclear
weapons. ‘

“The Soviet Union stands for

general and complete disarmament,

not only for arms control,” Aktam-
zjan, a specialist in disarmament.
said. “For us, the final goal is not
controlling the arms race—keeping
a hold on it——but stopping it all
together and starting the process of
gradually reducing the arsenals of
both sides.”

Aktamzjan said that the Soviet
Union supports the idea of a nuclear
freeze and sees it as being the only
sensible way to begin the process of
disarmament.

“We believe that one of the most
important elements of a program of
general and complete disarmament
would be a freeze,” he said. Accor-

For example, if a motorists needs
to stay on Forbes Avenue, he must
turn on to South Craig Street, go up
to Fifth Avenue, take Fifth to
Morewood and cut back across to
Forbes. A total of three stoplights.
The direct route from Forbes to
South Craig to Morewood involves
none. ‘

Ed Feldman, who owns a nearby
dry cleaners, had an opposite view,
however.

He said his business is off nearly
50 percent this summer, and he now
has to ship his clothes to his father’s
Centre Avenue store to cut costs.

“Some people find the business
drop-off an asset since parking’s
easier [on Centre],” he said. “But
most people find the extra travel a
‘detriment. This block has been
almost dead; I find it ironic that right
next door is Record Graveyard.”

The renovation has had various ef-
fects on businesses in the area. Local
businessmen differ in their opinions
about the renovation. Doug Hess,
owner of an Exxon station, said his
business has been running at about

to avoid conflicts with prepara-
tion for the upcoming football
season. Head football coach Foge
Fazio was unavailable for com-
ment on the new surface, but
Cummins said that the football
office did have input into the
selection of the new turf.

Other stadium improvements
being planned for the upcoming
season include improved lighting
in ramps, concession stands and
restrooms as well as additional
outside lighting which will make
Pitt a better candidate for night
football, according to Cummins.

Cancer

Patient
Care

An assistant professor in Pitt’s
graduate nursing program recent-
ly received recognition for her
research in the faield of cancer
patient nursing—known profes-
sionally as oncology.

Dr. Joyce Yasko and her assis-
tant Debra Zook, _an oncology
clinical nurse specialist at Magee
Womens Hospital, received the
Second Annual Oncology Nurs-
ing Society (ONS) Research
Award, presented at their Eighth
Annual Congress meeting held in
San Diego, California May l8-21.

Yasko and Zook were honored
for their study entitled
“Psychological Factors‘Their Ef-
fect on Nausea and Vomiting,”
which looked at inﬂuences on the
degree of vomiting and nausea ex-
perienced by first time
chemotherpay patients.

“We looked at psychological
factors present prior to their
receiving chemotherapy and then
tried to predict from that profile
which ones would experience
nausea and vomiting,” Yasko
said.

Yasko and Zook worked at
Montefiore Hospital with a sam-
ple of 30 patients ranging in age
from 20 to 60, most of whom suf-
fered from leukemia, Hodgkins
Disease. or breast cancer.

cling to Aktamzjan, the freeze should
be comprehensive and include “all
kinds of weapons, both nuclear and
conventional, both strategic and
tactical.

“We believe that the freeze should
be in effect at least during the dura-
tion of the talks during which we can
agree to any reductions of any
amount.”

Aktamzjan said one of the reasons
the Soviet Union supports a freeze
on nuclear weapons for the duration
of the talks is that one side should

"be under pressure from the weapons

program of the other side.

Aktamzjan sees the decision of the
Reagan Administration to deploy
new nuclear weapons in Europe by
the end of 1983 as contributing to the
acceleration of the arms race.

“Such an action would have a
most destructive impact on the situa-

tion in Europe and on the world as
a whole,” he said.

That action, he said, would be 
followed by some effective action by ‘
the Soviet Union. He said the
Kremlin has made statements that it
would take reciprocal measures if
Reagan goes ahead with the
deployment.

“We will consider that as a change
in the strategic balance,” Aktamzjan
said. “We feel that the siuation
would change drastically after the
appearance of 572 new medium
missiles in Western Europe.”

Aktamzjan said that he believes
both Americans and the citizens of
the Soviet Union want peace and
disarmament but that disarmament
can only occur‘ so long as both sides
negotiate from postions of equal_ R
strength. He also believes that the
development and deployment of a
new weapons system in the course of
negotiations would undermine the
talks and make agreement less likely.

Pittsburghers had a unique op-
portunity to exchange views with
citizens of the Soviet Union on
subjects such as families,
societies, life, culture and peace.
Twenty visitors from the Soviet
Union toured Pittsburgh as part
of a goodwill mission arranged by
both the U.S. and the Soviet
chapters of the friendship socie-
ty linking both countries.

in the United States, it is the U.S.

of the Pittsburgh branch, Lou
Bortz.

The Soviet visitors included jour-
nalists, farmers, professors,

engineers, a historian and a physi-
cian, among others. The groups
broke into smaller groups and
toured the city, addressed
students and met “with their
counterparts in various
professions.

The secretary of the U.S.S.R.-
U.S.A. Friendship Society in
Moscow, Badim Zhdanovich ,
stressed the need for peace bet-
ween the two countries. He said
that the purpose of the society is
to “promote better understanding

Pittsburgh is the national head-
quarters of the Oncology Nursing
Society and approximately 100 of
the society's 6000 members work
in area hospitals. The society
formed in l975 with the goal of
promoting the highest standards

of oncology nursing as well as to
encourage nurses to specialize in E
this field.

Funding
Announced

Pitt’s Graduate and Profes-
sional Student Association
(GPSA) recently voted to allo-
cate an annual funding contribu-
tion to the Pitt International
Student Organization (PISO)
marking the start of a coopera-
tive effort aimed at furthering the
cross-cultural exchange between
foreign and American students
at Pitt.

PISO, once exclusively an
organization for graduate stu-
dents, has expanded its member-
ship and now includes graduate,
undergraduate, American and
nonAmerican students. They
approached GSPA in the hope of
attaining funding and the request
was approved by a vote of the
GPSA officers.

PISO will use that funding
primarily for two upcoming
projects.

In an attempt to better coordi-
nate student services for new for-
eign students, PISO has designed
an informational packet to be
distributed to them upon arrival
at Pitt. The cost of the orienta-
tion packet will be partially
funded by GPSA with a match-
ing grant coming from the Office
of International Services.

GPSA is also funding a picnic
to be held June 18 at Schenley

Park's Flagstaff Hill. Organizers’
hope the event will help “bridge
the gap" between American and

foreign students as well as var- *

ious ethnic and nationality
groups.

Pitt
Hosts
Conference

Pittsburgh’s center for Latin
American Studies (CLAS) and
the city will play host to an
international conference entitled
“Social Security and Health
Care in Latin American and the
Caribbean in the 1980s” on June
27-29.

CLAS, which is part of the
University Center for Interna-
tional Studies, is in the midst ofa
two-year project studying that
same topic. Some Pitt professors
believe that some of the U.S.
Social Security program’s past
difficulties could be better under-
stood and future challenges bet-
ter faced and forecasted by stud-
ying the social security systems
of Latin America, which have
existed longer than the U.S. sys-
tem.

(;LAS’s involvement in the
study of social security and
health care in Latin America
began in I975 when it organized
an inter—American research
seminar in Mexico.

Keep Off
The Grass

“This shortcut saves only a few
steps. Isn’t your environment worth
more than that?”

Remember those signs? They disap-
peared from familiar pathways on cam-
pus last fall, along with uncounted
square feet of grass.

The beaten path thrives in Oakland
anywhere the grass grows, but one ex-
ample is especially interesting. Much of
the route marking the shortest distance
(on foot) from the Cathedral of Lear-
ning to the corner of Craig and Bayard
streets is now roped off, allowing the
soil to recover from its annual beating
in time for next fall’s stampede of feet.
Each year—for as long as an
undergraduate can remember——-this
hardy little path reappears, interrupted
only by the occasional road.

Doesn’t it look better now that a new
crop of grass is beginning to appear—if
you can ignore the rough twine bar-
riers? Maybe not. Perhaps it’s an illu-
sion caused by the recent burst of green
from the healthier grass and those trees
you never really notice in winter.

Wouldn’t it be nice if people would
take the extra steps to turn the corner
on the sidewalk and save the grass?

The alternative, of course, is to re-
seed it all again next year. And we
know who’ll pay for that.

Letters To The Editor

Tuition Fig ht Continues

Dear Editor:

As a member of the Progressive
Student Network (PSN) at the
University of Pittsburgh, I believe
the editorial comment entitled “Tui-
tion Fight Setback” in the June 8
issue of The Pitt News is an overreac-
tion to the disruption of the May 19
Board of Trustees meeting.
Although the insights created are
worthy of reflection, I do not believe
those conclusions drawn to be the
final verdict in this continuing
drama.

In order to clarify what I perceive
to be a misunderstanding regarding
the reason for the suspension of the
PSN’s funding and programming
privileges, I wish to point out that the
of ﬁcial excuse justifying the suspen-

’ sion is a supposed violation of the

recruitment advertising policy. W.
Andrew Smith, director of student
activities, states that the ad which ap-
peared in The Pitt News recruiting
people to the board meeting and to
the PSN was ‘.‘not in the spirit of
what a recruitment ad should be.”

The PSN maintains that it (the ad)
in fact captured the essence of
recruitment. Who has the right to
define the word “recruitment” and
to impose his interpretation onto
another? I believe this _issue_ is now
more than a strictly university mat-
ter. It is certainly more of an issue
than the simple violation of.univer-
sity procedures. The suspension may
well be a violation of the Constitu-
tional freedom of expression.

The obviously reactionary nature
of the Student Activities Office’s
response to the disruption indicates
an ostensible fact: just as the com-
plete funding cut to the University
Women’s Center was “politically
motivated” (Cynthia Vanda), the ac-
tions taken against the PSN are
politically motivated.

Certainly the PSN was aware that
the debatable tuition issue would not
be on the board meeting agenda-
we were informed of this fact at 9:30
that same morning--and that all
sincere efforts to discuss the tuition
issue and to work “through chan-
nels” to obtain results would be met
with resistance or at least complacen-
cy on the part of the Pitt administra-
tion and even our own student
government. However, no matter to
what extent the PSN directs its

energies toward confrontations with
deaf-cared and unsympathetic
monoliths representing stagnant in-
stitutions, the rising tuition issue will
remain unsolved without the broad-
based support form the student body
necessary to struggle against the con-
tinually rising tuition.

Considering the PSN’s valiant
though ineffective campus campaign
to inform students of the meeting
and the PSN’s purpose for its pro-
test, the practical concerns that ris-
ing tuition give to most of us and the
conduct of the Board of Trustees,
which for the past 12 of 13 years, has
approved annual tuition increases
during its summer meeting-—
precisely when student opposition
would be waning--the PSN’s
mobilization, the student body

response and the administrations’s
reactions are all somewhat
disheartening. Nonetheless, the Pro-
gressive Student Network maintains

an intense desire to address and

Even with a staggering 51 percent

‘tuition rise since 1978, according to

the Governmental Relations Com-
mittee, coupled with a 20 percent in-
crease in enrollment as registered by
the Admissions Office, the universi-
ty administration has responded with
the closing of the geography depart-
ment, the cutting of the Internship
Office, the closing of the Women’s
Center and the construction of a new
and costly Business School building,
and Dean Rosenberg is telling
students and faculty that anywhere

from 33 to 53 FAS faculty members i,

must be cut.

The Progressive Student Network
holds that education is a right, not
a privilege. If we are to assure the
principles of equality and opportuni-
ty for all, then a quality education
must be guaranteed to all.

As an afterthought, one could say
that the miniscule effort on the part
of three interested people had some
effect on the tuition issue—not a
victory—but certainly not a defeat.
By not including the tuition increase
on the Board of Trustees’ meeting

porarily delayed, thereby allowing
for amore effective organizing effort

ting a further tuition rise at Pitt.

The issue's absence from the agen-

VIOLENT PEMMES
Violent Femmes

Slash

Let's get something straight:
Violent Femmes are neither unne—
cessarily rabid nor are they
women; they're just three, young
hipsters from Milwaukee who
play an invigorating brand of rock-
n-roll which might be termed
Music For The New Beat Genera-
tion. There is no single word to
describe them, but the Femmes
are: cool without indifference,
passionate without the noise or
the pretension, folky and punk all
at the same time. Their self-
entitled debut LP is one of the
most ravishing records of 1983.

These guys know how to spear
a hook and sink it into a song so
deep that it'd take an entire med
school to dig it out of your head.
Every song is built around the
kind of sharp corners and angles
that seem to be stumbled upon,
but are really carefully calculated
to grab you at exactly the right
moment. "Yet there is an overrid-
ing sense of spontaneity here-
it's almost as if these people went

THE HURTING
Tears For Fears
Mercury

Music for the miserable—that
seems to be the mission of Tears
For Fears, a group whose pessi-
:mism seems to dominate every
aspect of their music, except for
their ability to turn out an impres-
sive album.

TFF is actually the moniker of
two sad gents from Bath, Eng-
land: Curt Smith and Roland
Orzabal. Their music is a melan-
choly mixture of percussion,
guitar, synthesizer and drum
machine that at times is reminis-
cent of The The. TFF's songs are
built upon several textures of per-
cussion and keyboards that col-
lide and mingle with Smith's and
Orzabal’s despair-ridden vocals.

The music is depressing to say
the least——every song is satu-
rated with a smothering tone of
world-weariness that eventually
fatigues the listener, but there is
still something narcotic about Th e

wrote and performed all the songs
in one take. Violent Femmes are
raw. Lead singer Gordon G_ano
sounds like Lou Reed if he'd been
popular during Presley's early
years—a biting, slithering outcast

edgy as their delivery. For exam-

music. Sure they take it too far
with their fatalism, but in the end,
the music still draws you back
with its lulling rhythms and
melodies.

For a debut album, Th e Hurting
is actually very good—even its
digital recording gives the album
an extra clean sound. Though
Fears overdo it in the sadness
department, these guys are quite
adept at the music they make. If
Curt and Roland ever cheer up
they'll be devastating.

FRANK DIGIACOMO

STARPEOPLE
Miles Davis
Columbia

The third record from Miles
Davis after a six-year hiatus
shows that Miles is playing jazz
as a true evolution of blues.
There is more horn playing on
this Lp than Man With The Horn
or We Want Miles.

The opening track, a blues
piece, "Come Get It” was

»

them stare/They'll hurt me had,
butl won't mind/Th ey'll hurt me
had, they do it/all the time..."
("Kiss Off").

Violent Femmes are heads and
shoulders above most groups in
many departments, but one rea-
son is because they do it all with-
out the trappings of mindless
layers of instrumentation. You
won't find a synthesizer in sight-

"inspired by an old Otis Redding
riff," and is complemented by
bursts of Miles’ trumpet which
seem to swell at the horn's
mouthpiece. The newest asset is
the addition of guitarist John
Scofield as second guitarist to
Mike Stern's Hendrix inspired
leads. Scofield is the soloist on
the other two tracks on side
one, "‘It Gets Better" ‘and
"Speak." Side two continues
with the brooding atmosphere
created with the first three pie-
ces. Miles interweaves solos
with Mike Stern's guitar on the‘

tracks "Starpeople" and "U'n'I.'7

Finally, there is "Star on
Cicely," named for Cicely Tyson
Davis, Miles’ wife of three
years, which is colored by the
soprano sax of Bill Evans.

This album owes no debt to
the world of jazz fusion. Each
piece is reminiscent of the jazz
outings of Miles Davis with his
quintet during the 1950 s. If
anyone wishes to be indoctri-
nated into jazz, Starpeople con-
tains jazz in its purest form with
the studio as its newest tool.

most of the songs are just acous-
tic guitars and bass, drums, and
an occasional violin or xylophone
thrown in for texture. Not only
does it serve as a challenge to all
the synthopop making it to the
top of the charts, but it will make
you wanna dan ce 'til you drop and
read the lyric sheet when you're
too exhausted to do anything’
else.

LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

Kizer on bass and Dick Ross
with percussion contribute
solidly, and Kristine Cummings
on keyboards provides‘ neat B-
movie style organ playing. The
Crowns don't do very much
that's new with rock-n-roll
stock parts, but it's fun anyway,
1960's style rock with vaguely
familiar but catchy tunes.

The no—nonense "Let’s Go"
starts things off and literally
running: "Let’s get out of here
before we get in trouble." The
Spanish influence prominent at
times is particularly effective in
"Dance Republic," one of the
album's highlights. "Dancing is
all we know," Joe says, and there
is an irresistable fiesta feel to it.
The slow ”Tears Been A-
Falling" is strategically placed at
the end of the first side—it acts
as a sort of cool-down before
side two.

"It's a party weekend...gonna
be some rock and rolling,"
warns the title cut. True, "Gra—
cias” sounds like "Blame it on
the Bossa Nova," and "Lupe"
calls to mind "Get Off My
Cloud," but Party Weekend is still
consistently enjoyable. "Try it
once...it's lots of fun,” Carrasco
urges in ”Perfect Spot," and it's
a reasonable suggestion. Crank
the hi-fi and add the friends and
beer.

Showcase, Wednesday June I4, 1983

By RICHARD SATER

The 1983 Kool Jazz Festival hit
Pittsburgh‘ on'Sunday, June 12, with
a -double dose of good—humored,
swinging jazz a la Ella Fitzgerald and
local saxophonist Stanley Turren—

tine. An estimated 85,000 attended\

the free concert at the Point, which
kicked off this portion of the 22-city

festival. ’’In the Mood” best describes

the temperament of the crowd that

- had ‘been gathering in front of the
’ bandstand since early afternoon.

Stanley Turrentine and his quartet
took the stage promptly at 8 o'clock.
”Pittsburgh!” enthused Turrentine.
”How’s everybody? Ready to get
down?” He opened wisely with ”Bird—
land,” a jumping no-nonsense ver-
sion of the familiar classic with good
ensemble work from his crew, partic-
ularly guitarist Greg Skaff and bas-
sist Ion Hart. _ -

Highlights of the band's hour-long
set were the bluesy ”Don’t mess with
Mr. T,” which gave Turrentine his
best solo chances, and ”Blow," a fast,
funk-influenced rhythmic number.
The finale, a hyperactive and inspir-
ing version of ”Betcha,” had the
crowd on its feet and roaring
approval.

Stanley Turrentine and quartet
effectively primed the audience for
the evening's main event, and with
the footlights in place and ”ELLA”
spelled out against the backdrop of
the stage, the First Lady of Song
made a mightily-encouraged
entrance. ”Thank you, Pittsburgh!
Thank you, love!” Ella Fitzgerald said
and wasted no time in getting down

‘ to business. Cole Porter's "Night and

Day” provided her opener, and she
had 85,000 people in her hand before
the end of it. ~

At 65, Ella Fitzgerald is an enter-
tainer in the fullest sense. She can
handle an audience as well as a song,
and she established easy rapport with

. thefhuge Sunday turnout. Her voice

is beginning to roughen just a bit,
particularly on the high notes, but
Ella is still Ella; her range is incredible

and her voice still powerful and‘

instantly recognizable, and she
stamped each lyric with her unique
phrase stylings.

   

c11vua:)z1is‘v'na T

Photo b ecky Seezox

Fitzgerald presented a nicely varied
program, mixing classics like"The
Man I Love” and ”Body and Soul”
with-a bit of country and even some
rock and roll ("If ya can't beat ’em,”

she said). "God Bless the Child" was _
moving tribute to Billie Holiday; 

good medley of Duke Ellington tunes
was included. Well-known for her
scatting, she offered a stunning ”One
Note Samba” entirely in that idiom. A
surprise hit of the evening was her
cover of ”Old MacDonald Had a
Farm,” endowing it with unheard—of
significance: ”What a swingin' farm!”

Accompanying Fitzgerald was the
Paul Smith trio, an excellent backer
consisting of Keter Betts on bass,

Bobby Durham on drums and Smith“,

on piano. A special guest, guitarist Joe
Pass, took the stage during the sin-
ger’s intermission and showed why
he is a virtuoso. He offered several
solo numbers—-"You Are the Sun-
shine of My Life" was the most
recognizable—providing at least four
hands’ worth of guitar playing in
terms of sound.

Pass joined Fitzgerald for a rousing
”It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got
That Swing” and made. the audience
believe it. She closed the show with ”I
Can't Stop Loving You,” and judging
from the response, the feeling from
the crowd was mutual. Fitzgerald and
Stanley Turrentine provided a mem-
orable concert, a fitting prelude of
which any jazz festival could be
proud.

Last year, ‘Ella Fitzgerald opened
the local Kool Jazz event with a sim-
ilar concert at the Point. Let's make
this annual thing. As she sings in ”In a
Mellow Tone," ”...the song is ended,
but the mellow tone lingers on....”
Yes. ‘

British Quintet Melts Their Fans

MODERN ENGLISH
Heaven
June 8, 1983

BY LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

It was difficult to imagine that all of
these people were seriously con-

cerned with the music of a band like «

Modern English. Post-punkers in
leather and ripped sweats, Go-Go
girls who undoubtedly can perfectly
lip-synch to ”Skidmarks- On My
Heart" and mohawked boys and girls
hardly seem like the kind of people
who'd care to listen to this serious

‘ English quintet who play brooding

melodies backed by somber lyrics.
But then again, everyone’s eating up

MTV and the band's "Melt With You”
is a video smash and hot on the charts
as a result. The sardine—can crowd
last week at Heaven perfectly exem-
plified the power of cable. They
drank—a lot, they smoked, they
danced, they watched the newly-
installed video screen playing things
like Lene Lovich’s ”Blue Hotel” and
Berlin's "Sex (I'm A...)" in awe, and
yes, they listened and enjoyed the
music of Modern English.

Modern English doesn't appear to
have the luxury—or should it be
necessitylztof a large repertoire.
They performed 10 songs and left the
stage without an encore, much to the

chagrin of the enthusiastic audience. _

Lead vocalist Robbie Grey had
explained earlier in the set that he

The physical fitness_mania seems
to be at its peak right now. Everyone
is exercise-conscious, and nearly
everyone has written a book about

Book has lodged itself firmly onto the
bestseller lists, but how many hope-
ful exercisers, after endless stretch-

resemble Miss Fonda? Linda Sun-
shine offers some respite with a new
program, something completely dif-

imitation of the other lane's book. A
parody of this sort was inevitable; at.

other lane's workout, says P. 1., is
"ridiculously strenuous,” so this new
program is toned down considerably.
No effort or sweat, promises the
book-and no result.

Proper exercise the Plain Jane way

eliminates nearly all movement;
should the participant feel warm or
(God forbid) begin perspiring, she
should rest or take a vacation. Diet-
ing guidelines are uncomplicated and
convenient: "don't substitute good
nutrition for good taste." The actual
exercises begin with a warm-up-
standing by the radiator and lifting
the coat. Or kissing a sailor. Aerobic
jogging is simplified by sitting down
and merely lifting alternate legs.
Buttock lifts are accomplished by
supporting said portion of the anat-
omy with a telephone directory or
two. A bucket of water provides an
efficient cool down, particularly
when thrown into the face.

The material following the illus-
trated exercises is rather tedious, but
on the whole, Sunshine’s Plain Jane
Works Out is an amusing and effective

poke at the fitness industry.

was suffering from a sore throat so
that may have been the reason for the
early departure, but still, his voice
sounded fine and it seemed a tad
overcautious to end the show after 45
minutes. A

Modern English’s strong point is
that they do not sound like everyone
else—their songs are more cerebral
than most of the music of their Brit-
ish counterparts, and while some of it

can be considered danceable, the bulltvﬁm

of it is just highly-listenable, rhyth-
mic pieces. They don't strive for the
beat-swish sound of The Human
League or Heaven 17, nor the min-
imalism of Depeche Mode. Their sig-
nature sound is heavy, brooding, and
lush without being overbearing or
smothering. Their set at Heaven
didn't stray at all from this, the only
difference between the record and
the live show being the band's appar-
ent effervescence and charm, espe-
cially in the form of Robbie Grey. The
singer smiled broadly, talked to the
audience—often encouraging them
to ”try -and find some room to
move”—and, in general, just gave the
strong impression that he was having
a great time.

They played all but one tune from
their only American album, After The
Snow, and two new ones to boot.
(Grey introduced the title track by
saying, ”This is something for your
brains as well as your face.”) But they
saved the one everyone wanted to
hear for last, ”Melt With You,” send-

I ing the crowd, mohawks and Go-Go's

alike, into ecstasy as they finally
found the room to ”move” and
danced into one another in oblivion.
It's too bad that this signalled the end
of their show, but you can be sure
that few witnesses’ could say any-
thing bad about a group as good as
Modern English.

Showcase, Wednesday June 14, 1983

BY LINDA HENRY

Presently running at the Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre through June 25
is a play called Bad Habits by Terrence McNally, directed by Roni Ostfield.
Actually, it is two one—act plays with sort of the same theme, using the same
actors. This is intriguing since you get to see each actor portray two
characters in one evening. On the other hand, billed as a comedy, this
production is more silly than funny, and given the lack of substance in the
lines, could do with more beefed-up slapstick to induce more laughs. How-
ever, even silly can be fun and the cast acts as a finetuned machine in both
plays.

"Ravenswood," the first play, takes place at a sort of resort for couples
with run-down relationships. It is run by Jason Pepper, M.D. (Dr. Pepper), a
man with an unorthodox philosophy for marriage counseling. His attitude
is Anything Goes (he himself sits in a wheelchair, crippled since his ex—wife
pushed him down a flight of stairs, giving advice as he downs straight vodka
and chainsmokes). Dr. Pepper is played with convincing wackiness by Bob
Wenzel. As for the results, the only couple that seems to change any/ is
Dolly and Harry Scupp who have spent the last few years of their middle-
class marriage trying to kill each other. You are left with the feeling that
once they return home from Ravenswood, they will finally succeed.

The second play, ”Dunelawn,” makes more of a statement as we get to
know four patients at a rehab center run by Dr. Toynbee, a man who
wanders through the set speaking gibberish as he checks on his patients.
Toynbee’s methods for rehabilitating chronic alcoholics, sexual deviates,
and, we are to suppose, anyone with any kind of bad habit, is to shoot them
with a serum, leaving them delightfully oblivious to the world around
them. His goal is ”zero defects” as grandly explained by Nurse Ruth Benson
(Barbara Whitney who was also Dolly Scupp in ”Ravenswood") to her
protege Becky Hedges (Patty Pelcz, at brassy young starlit April Pitt in
”Ravenswood,” a novice nurse full of insecurities in ”Dunelawn”). Rather
than succumbing to the Toynbee method and principles, Becky ends up
running away with the only person who doesn't care about his bad habits-
Bruno. G. W. Rooney is at home with his hippie portrayal of the grounds-
keeper Bruno, much more than as Otto in ”Ravenswood."

The set designed by Bonnie Vaky and lighting by David Strang combine
to create a nice feel for the outdoors of sterile manicured patios and lawns
for the obviously phony crepe paper hedge upstage left. Yet, that one quack
hedge amid the wacky doctors and hopeless patients may make the biggest

statement of the two plays.

‘Your Mother's
Calling, Norman

I)‘-

By BRENDAN BEARY

If it's possible that anyone has missed
the TV commercials, Anthony Perkins
is back as Norman Bates, Hollywood's
best-known killer, who has just spent 22
years in a mental institution, and has
now been released at local theaters
near you in Psycho H, the sequel to
Alfred Hitchcock's original.

A lot of people have dumped on Psy-
ch o H, and it's easy to seewhy. Had this

 

SNI)l}IC-id ANOHINV

movie ended five or ten minutes earlier,
director Richard Franklin would have
had a commendablefilm on his hands-
a smart blend of insanity and irony,
smooth pacing, and some camera
angles that Hitchcock would have been
proud of.

But the real culprit turns out to be
writer Tom Holland, who spoiled a
good movie by adding a final bizarre
twist to poor Norrnan’s fate. There's no
way to hint at Holland's wretched finale
without blowing the whole story, but it
is enough to say that it lays to waste all
the noble work of the first 100 minutes.

On its own, Psycho II is still better
than any other recent horror film. But

like world wars and Super Bowls,
movies with roman numerals after their
names can't be considered indepen-
dent cf their predecessors, and this one
has  shoes to fill, and can't possibly
have the same impact.

Before 1960, murder movies seemed
to be hinged on large inheritances or
love triangles. Norman Bates was the
first Hollywood murderer whose expla-
nation was insanity. Nowadays, of
course, psychopaths are all you find in
horror films, constructed on the flimsi-
est cf premises and chasing teenagers
around with the most ridiculous house-
hold appliance they can lift.

But whereas modern horror films
depend on gore and special dfects,
Hitchcock films had fewer acts cf vio-
lence, were very sparingin their use cf
blood and concentrated more on ten-
sion and setting. The result is that, by
today's splatter-the—wall standards,
Hitchcock's films can seem tortuously
slow.

The sequel is generally a good corn-
promise of two styles—soundly con-
structed and with a higher
adrenalin—per-minute rate than the orig-
inal (although some cf this may be lost
on the new generation of viewers who
never saw Psych o and don't recognize
the legendary house on the hill.) The
writing is crisp in most places, even lift-
ing bits of dialoguefrom the original and
offering Meg Tilly in a teasing re-
enactment of the shower (by the way,
Janet Leigh's famous scene is this film's
initial sequence, serving as a setup for
those who missed the original.)

in short, Psycho Il may be the best
bad movie of the summer, and should
be seen, if for no other reason than to
see how little it takes to kill a good film.

Fiction — The South
American Way

”WE LOVE GLENDA SO MUCH”
AND OTHER TALES

Julio Cortazar

Knopf

South American fiction, trans-
lated for American consumption,
seems to be the trend. The best of
its a'uthors—Gabriel Marquez, for
example—are different and excit-
ing; perhaps the inherent "foreign-
ness” of the material adds to the
attraction, as in a travelogue film-—
a visit tounexplored territory. But
still, the fiction rightfully should
provide a bit of fireworks on its
own.

Julio Cortazar, an Argentine who
now writes from Paris, has contrib-
uted a dazzling and difficult collec-
tion of ten stories to the
library—"We Love Glenda SoMu ch"
and Other Tales. Depicted on the
surface are daily lives and accessi-
ble characters—for instance, a
young girl bicycling through
Europe in ”Moebius Strip," the (sub-
way travelers in "Text in a Note-
book," a group of madrigal singers
on tour in "Clone," or a young
mother who is suspicious of her
maid’s new boyfriend in "Return
Trip Tango." But their situations
are subtexted with unsettling
underpinnings, at times terrifyingly
casual.

Janet, the cyclist, dies during a
rape, unknown to her assailant until
afterwards. An interested observer
investigates some discrepancies in
subway operation—113,987 pas-
sengers enter the hole, but only

,113,983 resurface—and a secret

underground community is disco-
vered. The singers on tour find that
their own lives begin to parallel that

'of the Renaissance composer

Gesualdo, whose works they are
performing. The maid’s gentleman

friend is her misTress’s former

lover, seeking roundabout revenge. ‘-

Cortazar seems to be operating the
”theater with mirrors and camera
obscuras...with sharp images”
which he describes in "Orientation
of Cats"—different ways of looking
at the cinematographics of reality.

It is most sharply displayed in the
title story, the best of the collection.

Glenda Garson, well-known film

queen, has legions of fans, a select .

group of whom go beyond "the ads,
the endless lines, the posters. and
the reviews.” This faction realizes
that her films are not without flaws;
slowly and painstakingly, the group
"who loved Glenda” collects all
prints of her movies and re-edits
them to perfection, "precisely in
tune with desire.” When Miss Gar-
son decides to retire, her legacy is
secure, but some time later, she
announces a comeback. Thosewho
love her recognize the possible dis-
aster and decide that there is only
one solution.

Glenda will be murdered; Corta-
zar merely offers "we would save
her from the fall...one does not
come down from a cross alive.”This
and the other stories in the book
create an unreal, dreamlike atmos-
phere, lulling the readers into an
almost-other-worldly state; like
spectators, we watch the action
unfold through a curious translu-
cent curtain of well-built prose.

"So many things begin and per-
haps end as a game..." Cortazar
says in "Graffiti," and it is as good
an epigram as any for his writing.
Gregory Rabassa has provided this
translation from the Spanish; one
wonders if anything is lost during
the process, but "We Love Glenda So
Much" and Other Tales is a re-
markable and surprising set.

Belowich Nets

By MARK A. SINDLER

This was a team that literally

“swam away with the Big East cham-

 

pronship earlier this year, yet did so
while concealing weakness.

Lady Panthers swimming coach
David Belowich perhaps relied on
other squad strengths while nursing
a highly suspect lineup in the but-
terﬂy spot. After graduating four-
time All-America Amy Jackson,
Judy Terrell (three-time), Nancy
Henry (three-time) and Sandy Tay-
lor all at once last year, there was
some rebuilding in store.

Or so was intended.

Anyway, Belowich et al. ulti-
mately relied upon sophomore-to-
be Nordine Borrel, “who did a nice
job at butterﬂy.“ Belowich admit-
ted, but will now have more than
enough company as recruiting
endeavors have paid off.

Recruiting several scholastic
swimmers adept at turning in
impressive times in the butterﬂy is
not the only service Belowich will
have the services of this upcoming
season. He can also anticipate
added versatility and expect to see
improvement from primarily six
girls who have already proved their
prowress in dominating fashion.

Getting acquainted with Trees
Pool for the following four years will
be: ,

0 Susan Hickman-—The Orlando,
Fla. native hails from Colonial High
School at which she was nationally
ranked by U.S. Swimming in the
sprint freestyle. Hickman is a three-
time high school All-America, is the
state champion in the 50-freestyle
and runner-up in the 100-freestyle.
Belowich will use her primarily in
the spring freestyle and in the spring
butterﬂy.

0 Tracy Pfister—Calling her
“probably the fastest swimmer in the
state,” Belowich nailed this back-
stroker from Bethel Park. Pﬁster is
also accustomed to the middle-
distance, intermediate medley spots
and is considered a freestyle special-
ist. Said Belowich: “She has a lot of
improvement to make, but has
shown me plenty of versatility so
far."

0 Jodi O'Neil—-From Rochester,

N.Y., O'Neil can run the entire
gamut, according to Belowich. She
is a breaststroke specialist, but also
has experience at intermediate med-
ley and at freestyle. O’Neil took
third place in the 200-yd. breast
stroke in Junior Nationals competi-
tion recently and made Senior
Nationals time from that qualifying
swim.

0 Stacy Moller——Belowich again
thought of shoring up the butterﬂy
position when he. plucked this dis-
tance freestyler from Upper St.
Clair. “We needed to help the ﬂy
spot,” he said, “and that’s one thing
that was our objective.”

0 Nahir Terez——Also a butter-
ﬂyer, the Puerto Rico native will
team with Moller, Belowich theo-
rized, in freestyle events. Terez will
mostly see sprint action and Moller
will get the nod at distance freestyle.
“They can split off their ﬂy special-
ties to swim other things, too,” Belo-
wich added, in general terms.

0 Christine Kaucher—From
Reading, Pa., Kaucher will be prim-
arily used as a mid-distance free-
styler. “Here again, we have Sue
Heon back, who’s one of the best
distance freestylers in the country,”
Belowich said. “And now a three-
time All-America here. But we
needed some depth help and Chris is
going to fill that spot very nicely.”

Belowich also filled a vacant spot
in one-meter diving by recruiting
Patricia Ney from Chalfont, Pa. In
recent state high school competi—-
tion, Ney finished second in the state
in one-meter competition.

Coming off a nationally-ranked
season (NCAA, l8th), Belowich
seems satisfied by his recruiting
efforts.

“What’s nice about this entire
recruiting year,” he continued, “is
that we have filled our priorities:
butterﬂy, sprint freestyle, IM,
breaststroke and diving."

After four-year star Jan Ujevich
hung up her goggles last April, Belo-
wich anticipated the graduation well
enough in advance to make up for
the loss of her talents.

“(Ujevich) was a sprinter, breast-

‘stroker and lM’er and nationally

ranked in each,” Belowich said.
“And when I needed any one of the
three or all three in combination, I
couldn't ﬁnd someone as versatile as
she is or as fast as she is.

“So, the consequence is this
makes us a much stronger team."

Pros Become Washed Up

By MARK A. SINDLER

Slowly the ocean creeps up on the
unsuspecting beach, dissolving fine
granules of sand and giving new
meaning to erosion, at a slow but
sure rate. The beachhead used to be
a piece of geography that all could
feast their eyes upon.

No one ever thought that the lap-
ping waves were more a threat to the
dunes than MCI is in unseating
MaBell as the push-button con-
glomerate of all time. Hell, even the
glistening water was a sight to
behold.

Viewpoint

Now that sight of yesteryear has
turned into a cesspool. Maybe a toxic
waste dump is more analagous.
Maybe we should just say that the in-
ﬂuence of drugs is all too inviting or
accomodating for today’s profes-
sional athletes to disregard without
more inquisitive inspection.

But the day has arrived. When will
it leave...well, NASA may already
have made life very compatible on
planet Pluto.

Meantime, that beachhead of pro-
fessional sports is currently inun-
dated with almost as many users as
one will find on an average swing
through Times Square. The ocean?
Presently, there’s no stopping the
tide of drugs, booze and other far-
out hallucinogens.

The latest one to be committed to
drying-out/settling-down centers is
the St. Louis Cardinals’ Lonnie
Smith. Just over the weekend,
management released a statement
detailing Smith’s dependence on
drugs, it not mattering what exactly
he was popping in his mouth or
shootiong up his arm.

Smith now joins the company of
such notables as Darrel Porter, now
a St. Louis catcher, Minnesota Vik-
ings’ quarterback Tommy Kramer
and Los Angelos Dodgers’ rookie
pitcher phenomenon of two years
ago, Steve Howe, among others.

Most of today’s professional
athletes usually admit to their bosses
that they have indeed engaged in a
heaven-reaching practices and that
the time has arrived for rehabilita-
tion. And, just as usually, most
owners are quite obliging. They
either already have such rehab pro-
grams established under team
auspices or one is established as soon

as the multi-thousand or multi-
million dollar paid star is found to
be. popping pills that aren’t of the
Fltnstones variety or is swigging
bottled liquids that aren’t found on
the same shelves as the better-known
colas.

Are today’s owners right in run-
ning to the forefront and proclaim-
ing that there is no problem if their
employee takes a few weeks o'f f and
dries out? Is the lack of discipline
meted out by the owners towards the
players a sign of a very liberal
attitude?

in other words, when one athlete
sees a colleague fall to the detriments
of drug abuse and not suffer very
limiting consequences, is there any
reason to believe that the athlete
won’t go the drug route, not fearing
later retribution?

Yet, suppose the owners wouldn’t
give a wooden nickel to supporting
a drug rehab program. Would they
then be considered money-grubbers,
only out to make the bucks as

brought in by their highly-paid‘

athletes?

Either way the problem is diagnos-
ed, the owners will soon come under
some wicked artillery fire for their
participation or lack thereof in

all expected to be top candidates in’

replacing Ujevich’s capabilities.

Belowich further said of these
three blue-chippers, “They not only
represent front-line swimming, but
depth swimming, too. We really
should be a stronger team this (com-
ing) year than this past one.”

All that remains to be seen is
whether Belowich can effectively
utilize his newly found talent and

avoid another 0-5 start, as happened
last season, enroute to perhaps a
more convincing capturing of the
Big East title. S"

Too Fast Today

aiding comatose—like athletes. If the
owners freely and completely give
their players all the rehabilitation
help they want, then that’s a sign of
“Hey, everyone else does it, so it’s
OK if you do it too.”

However, should the owners turn
their backs on today’s superstars,
then the threat is real of fan and
media backlash as people cry of
apathy and indifference among the
status-seeking team owners.

Looking at the entire problem
from a neutral perspective, the cure
does not lie in taking portraits of Ben
Franklin from players’ pockets. Nor
does the cure lie in indefinitely or
permanently suspending the player
or players involved. You do not

‘teach a f ive-year-old not to ever spill
milk again by sending him to a base-
ment corner.

No, the answer probably lies in to-
day's fan. Why aren’t sports freaks
actively venting their rage over the
loss of heroes? Are the images por-
trayed by Ted Williams, Babe Ruth,
Lou Gehrig, Rocket Richard, Wilt
Chamberlain or Gale Sayers lost
forever to the crumpled pages of
yellowing newsprints?

if sports fans continue to.

patronize daily sporting events and

the like, while giving no more than
a passing word to drug abuse in
sports, there is no reason to believe
that today’s alcoholic on the gridiron
can’t become tomorrow’s crazed and
dazed wanderer on the city streets.

l’m not saying leave the entire
responsibility of cleaning up today’s
pro athletes to the blue- or white-
collar Joe on the street. It would help
the cause if local criticism were dish-
ed out.

In any case, the owners and their
rehab programs must continue on
their merry way. Look at it as part
of a Blue Shield coverage plan that
a millworker might receive. Afterall,
today’s drugged-out pros are most-
ly those who rake in more than
Oman’s yearly per capita.

If the owner unloads a perennial
Triple Crown threat or one who
comes along as often as Herschel
Walker, then he or she will be feel-
ing the adverse effects later when
similar people will be competing on
the other team, maybe beating the
brains out of the now reluctant
owner’s players.

Then, maybe someday we can all
look forward to the sun-drenched
beachheads that we all enjoyed

wallowing in just a few years back.

mercial television regional cable
outlets.

Previously, the conference had an-
nounced three-year agreements with
CBS and NBC, totalling a minimum
of six conference and eight intersec-
tional games annually.
