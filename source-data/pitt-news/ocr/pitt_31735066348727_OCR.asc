‘BY SUSAN 

A-' dispute over the addition of
three ‘black students _ to Pitt’s
all.-white wo_men’s cheerleading
squad has left the group on
unstable ground until ap agree-
ment can be reached on tryout

-.¢;fs:ocedu_res and organizational

structure.

Although athletic department
ofﬁcials said plans should be made
ﬁnal within the next few weeks and
expressed no doubt that the squad
would be ready for the football
season, the cheerleaders them-
selves are wary of drastic changes
in their program._

The controversy stems" from last
month’s cheerleading tryouts,
when none of the six black candi-

\4§;,.4laltes. from a ﬁeld of 23 was

  se ected. The judges, all white,

were three male coaches, cheer-
leading advisor Sandra Bullman
and two co-captains from last
year’s squad. A black male coach
had been invited to judge, but was
unable to attend the tryouts.

‘Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs Alfred Move later_received
complaints from several black
students and a white student who
alleged the cheerleading program
was being operated like a private
club in that outsiders were pre-
vented from entering it.

Moye took the problem to Ath-
letic Director. Casimir Myslinski,

 who proposed to expand the squad

A~WCheer|eader Debate

.,\c,

Linda Armbruster, who was.
elected , captain V of ‘next year's

squad before the dispute devel-

I lllllIlllllllllllllllllllﬁillllllllllllllllliﬁ

oped, was surprised by allegations
of ‘the group’s exclusiveness. ,

“I can’t believe anyone would
charge we are a clique,” said-
Armbruster. “I’ve been on the
squad for three years and I never

knew of any girls who made it-

before tryouts started. We go by
the highest scores in the tryouts.”

None of- the black women who
would have been added to the
squad under the Myslinski plan
wished to comment on the issue,
but one said, “I’m tired of talking
about it.”

Because several of the cheer-
leading candidates objected to the
proposal to expand the squad, a
meeting was held for all tryout
candidates. Myslinski suggested
forming two squads that would
include all applicants. A cheer_-
leading coach would then decide
which members’ would cheer at
which games according to the
progress they made. ‘

Again the cheerleaders objected,
but it appears the new plan will be
approved anyway.

“We don’t want to force a P131?
on the girls,” Bullman said)
“However, if they look into the
plan, they’ll probably accept it. I
hope so--they need to get started
with practice.” .

Moye has praised the proposal as
fair and productive, adding that
objection to the proposal probably
came from racist sources.

Armbruster said she ‘also feels
the two-squad plan will be accepted‘
although the cheerleaders seem
reluctant to abide by it.

“The girls don’t think the plan V

would work. If there are two_
squads, girls on the ﬁrst squad will
be reluctant to help the other ones
with routines,” Armbruster said.
“There’ll be too much competition
among the girls. I ‘

“It will also be difficult because
we are a partner‘ squad. We
practice with male cheerleaders
and, if someone from the second
squad is picked to cheer for a
game, it will be impossible for her
to work out the routines,” she
added. I - p

Japan Grants Pitt  Million-U

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
and; other Pitt administrators
ofﬁcially accepted Tuesday the first
installment of .the recently an-
nounced $1 million gift from the
Japan Iron and Steel Federation to
Pitt’s Asian Studies Program. ' _

At a reception in the Chancel-
lor’s office, two executive ofﬁcers
ofthe Nipon Steel Corporation USA
Inc.--Tokuji Ohashi, president, and
T. Kobayashi, secretary--formally
acknowledged the presentation of
the first part of the ﬁve-year grant,
wishing Pitt great luck in the use of
the grant to further pursue East

production,” Ohashi said. “We
are honored to offer this grant at
the home of the steel industry--
Pittsburgh.”

Th_e reception, scheduled to
coincide with birthday of V His
Imperial Majesty Hirohito, Em-
peror of Japan, was in honor of the
largest gift ever given Pitt by a
foreign benefactor.

“We are deeply grateful for this
gift,” Posvar said. ‘‘It will provide
unique scholarly opportunities for
the beneﬁt of Japanese and
American students, as Japanese
scholars bring us first hand
impressions of-their culture and
return. to teach with ' a clearer
understanding of ours.” I
_ In acceptance of the grant,
Chairman of Pitt's Asian Studies
Department William Darrill said he
hoped the gift would have a
permanent effect on the University:
In order to insure the effect, Dorrill
said, Pitt plans to spend only the
interest on the huge endowment;
thus leaving the V original sum

increment to the. University,”
Dorrill said,»-“and as part of our

Dorrill added the money would
be used to strengthen the Asian.
Studies Program--teaching, learn-
ing and research both by students
and feculty members.

GI Educational Benefits:_
Bill Extension Proposed

BY ‘HARRIS LEVY A

Veterans should have a longer

‘ time to utilize their GI Bill educa-

tional benefits, Pitt's Director of
Veteran Affairs Jack Hayes said
yesterday.

Hayes called for the removal of
the delimitations date under the GI

Bill that the use of educational
benefits to lU years following
discharge. He also urged‘ the

passage of congressional measures
that would increase benefits from
their current duration of 36
months. '

“izxtending the benefits will
alow veterans to go part-time"
without worrying about beneﬁts
running out." Hayes said. “The
cxtension should ‘apply to veterans
in on-the-job training programs’
and not just college students."

Under the U1 Bill passed in 1966,
veterans who were discharged
between 193.) and 1960, the period
iiot_ covered by prior legislation,
and until May 1, 1974 to use their
benefits. A two year extension
already granted gives veteraifs
until May l. 1976 to make use of
their aid.

House Resolution 2009, which
rcinovcs the time limit, would also
ifcstorc benefits to those who had
theirs terminated." Hayes said.

" lhis would include 52% of World A

War II Veterans and 63% of
Korean War Veterans who didn't
_take full advantage of the pro-
gram.” ' . - -

groundwork for the endowment.

The grant marks the second time
the seven-year-old Asian Studies
Program has received funding from
an Asian—based company. Pitt in
1974 received $50,000, also in
support of Asian Studies, from the
American subsidiary of C. Itoh &
Co., Ltd., "a Japanese trading ﬁrm.

Since _ then, and until the
Japanese Iron and Steel Federa-
tion’s $1 million grant came the
Asian Studies Program was funded
through governmental grants, sup-
port from US corporations and
foundations with an interest in
Asia, and University income.

Pitt is in the midst of a Univer-
'sity~wide fund campaign to “add a
margin of excellence” to research
and teaching programs over and
above the basic support provided
by tuition and governmental in-
come. The Japanese grant in-
creases the amount raised in the
campaign to.more than $8,750,000.

 

Great buys in sculpture, pottery,
painting and other art forms are
promised by the Tree of Life
Congregation at the corner of
Wilkins and Shady Avenues, from
10 am to 9 pm, May 4th.

An assortment of art works and
the contributing artists will be on
the scene to help interested
persons select original pieces at the
right prices. The artists will
discuss personal needs of inter-
ested buyers, too.

Mugs, bowls, plates and woven
goods also will be offered for sale

'by the Women’s American ORT.

Donations are $1, with tickets
available at the door or through any

program. “World War II veterans
.got 48 months,” he noted.
According to_ Hayes, many vet-
terans currently go to school full-
time to take fullest advantage of
the GI Bill. A longer period of

I benefits would ease the pressures

many veterans encounter. “Many
of these people are married with‘
children, working, buying a house
and paying off a car, but going full
time to maximize their use of
beneﬁts."

Recent developments like com-
munity colleges and open admis-
sion have increased the educational
opportunities of veterans.

Between 4000-5000 students
attend Pitt under the GI Bill.
"There are 2500 in any one term,”
Hayes said. This figure includes
other people besides ‘veterans such

-as their widows and dependents of

disabled veterans.

Current legislation is tilted in
favor of undergraduates, Hayes
said. “Not to slight undergrad-

extend coverage to others. It
comes back in the form of quality

three major planks--holding the
line of taxes, attracting new
industry and demanding federal
and state assistance to provide
relief for taxpayers in the “inﬂa-
tion-recession crunch."

The Flaherty/Jaffurs primary
campaign has received both a boost
and a barrage of criticism because
of support from the candidate’s
brother,“ Mayor Peter Flaherty.
Analysts have pondered the value
of the Flaherty name at the polls,
but Foerster has charged that
another Flaherty as Commissioner
would turn the City and Allegheny
County into a family operation.

Both Flaherty and Jaffurs have I
been exposed to the political _ .

process in the past. Jaffurs, a
former Wilkinsburg mayor, was
fired by Governor Shapp in 1972 for
publicly charging‘ members of the
Liquor Control Board and their
employees with unethical practices-
when he was legal counsel for the
board. I . '1

Flaherty served as his brother’s

campaign manager during the two '

mayoralty drives and last year’s US
Senate try. '
‘Minority incumbent Commis-
sioner,Wil1iam Hunt has teamed up
with Clerk of Courts Robert Peirce
in a continuing attack on the
Staisey/Foerster team. .
-“Eight years of Staisey/Foerster
is enough,” Peirce has said. f‘And

I, 12 years would be a disaster.”
‘Hunt, 60, and Peirce, recently‘

turned 37, have been called a.
maverick ticket for their recurring
differences before and during the
campaign. However, _both agree
county

now “15 to 20%_don’t work at all.”
Both Flaherty/Jaffurs and the
Hunt/ Peirce . teams have
directed their campaigns against
the Democratic incumbents,
However, two other ‘Republicans,
Greentree , Councilman John
McManus and John Kostelak, a
White Oak credit service employee,
have taken up the challenge.

McManus has aimed-criticism at.

The simple solution

/

. Dear Editor,

There are truly a great number in
 the .teaching profession who are
qualiﬁed -educato,rs‘but lack the

the student. Most do not have the
' _capability to interest students,
much less inspire them. They keep
t on teaching, they keep on boring
, students, causing students not‘ to
produce their.best, causing stu-
_ ' dents to turn off to education and
ultimately hurting the quality of
’ education in the system whether it
E ' be primary, secondary or ‘college
-level. ’ x t ,‘
. We in the studio arts department
‘are fortunate "enough to have
.: several educators who have ‘the
; '. ability to_ communicate and most
important, inspire students to learn
and work. ’
, Interestingly enough, Virgil Can-
tini, chairman of the department, is
the only faculty member to have

-I tenure. ’_Oth’er teachers such as
‘ Thomas Brunger and David Kee-
_ ton, when they come up for tenure,

1 may be forced to leave; this has
already happened to Robert Qual-
~ _ters.

You can not have a strong
department with radical and
frequent changes in the, faculty.
Unfortunately, due to an adminis-
trative decision, we are losing
Pamela Endacott," one such educa-
tor. Endacott has been with the
Studio Arts department since
September 1974. She came fresh
from graduate school to Pitt and in
f three and a half months was judged
"unsatisfactory, by Virgil Cantini.

No other instructor in the
’ _department has been» given such a
short time to prove themselves.
. ' Even if she had been a poor
I‘ instructor, more time would have
,- ‘ ‘been expected for a fair evaluation.
V 7 This is unfortunate for the
 t University because Endacott ex-
{cells as an artist and even _to_a
greater extent as an instructor.
She has the ability to inspire
students to do their best and she
has the ability to bring creativity
and desire out of students.
Pamela Endacott is not dry or
boring, she is full of life and
invigorating and can transfer this
to students. Her students’ work is
proof of her abilities as a teacher
 and studentopinion of herruns
 5 high.

? Soif she is such a good educator,

why is Mr. Cantini letting her

contract expire? Officially, a

faculty evaluation found her to be
' technically uncapable. Technical

ability ' can be learned, almost
U anyone off the street can learn

7educators have real teaching ability

which Endacott possesses.

  

 
   
 

I ability to get the material across to .

 Down to th e Roots .
" The current confusion over the structure of Pitt’s cheerleading squad
symbolizes a University administration trend to gloss over -issues in the
operation of its offices and activities.
__ 9 Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski’s proposal to establish twin

1_ teams of cheerleaders, with members dressing for games on a
j Y competitive basis, is an effort to dispense with the real questions raised

5 by students and Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Dr. Alfred Moye’
over the functioning of the squad. " I

‘ If, as some maintain, black members were excluded because of racist
attitudes on the squad, then Myslinski’s attempt simply to inject three V .
3, "black members adds up to nothing more than a quota system--a cynical
4 manipulation of people to boost a PR image. ,

If, as still more suggest, the cheerleading squad is simply a
self-contained clique, thenthe introduction of a polarized program of
competition within the squad is no desirable alternative.
One-upmanship would work only to the detriment of squad -

- cohesiveness, thus defeating right from the start its efforts to perform

, . _ t6 this mess is not blind‘ groping or,

, ’ eleventh-hour decisions, but an intense concentration on the real roots
, __ of the problem, racist or elitist. Once this has been determined,
 Myslinski, Moye and Pitt administrators can ta.ke the proper steps to
best restructure the squad, if indeed they are necessary.

Eltfhe Good, Cast Off

polyester resin and the technical
ability of working withclay on both

‘ small and ‘large scale, she also has

the ability in working with plaster
casting. Her students also work in
other media such as wood and
metal sculpture, she does have
technical ability.

Endacott also has personal initia-
tive; she has takenja welding class
and in the past school year has
done nothing. but.grow in know-
ledge and technical ability.

Pamela Endacott has been here
eight months and excelled as V an
instructor,‘ her first four months’of

teaching. were especially. good‘

considering she came straight from
graduate school, and the second
four months have improved to .a
higher level.

Nevertheless she is being ‘let go.
This is tremendously unfair to her
and the students of the University

who will never have the chance to I

study under a,truly tine educator.
After all, isn’t that what a
university is for--its students?

It should be of first priority that
Dean Rosenberg personally _look

into this matter because if anyone V _

should be interested in losing a
young talented educator, it should
be the Dean of Faculty.‘

My observations of Endacott have
come from my studying under her,
others’ who have studied under her
and from the work of her students.
I ﬁnd -it very difficult’ to justify the
administrative decision to let this
valuable asset to the University ‘go.

BY CAL RITCHEY

There have been a- lot of rumors
lately concerning Oakland--some
people say the ‘quality of life’ here
is deteriorating, that the area is
becoming dangerous and that
people just aren't friendly any-
more. _

We didn’t believe it, so, we

decided to take a walk through,

beautiful downtown Oakland.
Statistically, 50% of our group was
female. Her name was Sally. '
We stood on the ‘street in front of
the Golden Upside-down Double-u
at noon, hoping to get. some good
old-fashioned person-in-the-street
interviews. Nobody seemed
interested in us. Even waving_our
notebooks in people’s faces didn’t
help. People just looked away or

shook their heads and. kept,

walking, until one neatlyrdressed
man accidentally bumped me.

“Pardon me,”‘_, he apologized
profusely, helping me up_ and
solicitiously dusting me.‘ ‘‘I’m so
sorry! Probably ruined those blue
jeans, didn’t I? Here”--he pulled
out a ﬁve-dollar bill--“take this and
get your clothes cleaned.” _Of
course I wouldn’t ‘take. his
money--it was an accident--so he
apologized again and disappeared
down the street.

By this time we were hungry,’ so

we slipped into the Golden_

Double-u, intending to have a Big
Duck, but "somehow" ’I’d lost my
wallet and Sally had -,.to pay. ’

Outside again, we thought maybe
people on the main street were too
‘busy, so we moved to Atwood near
the Anthropology Building. As we

. passed one of the bars, a lady
almost hidden in a doorway caught
our attention. 4

. _.‘-‘Let’.s.inter.view her,” _I said.
"‘-She doesn’t seem to be going‘

_anywhere.” She smiled when she
saw me, but the smile slipped when
shenoticed Sally waiting across the
street.‘ .

“Pardon me,” I said politely.
‘.‘Could you tell me a little about
yourself?” v I _

‘‘I’ll tell you all you want to know

" for $20,” she said sweetly. I

to swing that way, try Bouquet
Street.” She turned and slipped

into the bar. Sally and I looked at"

each other and shrugged. Maybe‘
we should try another approach.

We-went back to Forbes Avenue
and sat down in the middle of the’
sidewalk,_ waiting for a crowd to
gather so we could ask questions.

Within seconds, we.heard sirens
in the distance. The crowd had just
begun to build when blue-suited
policemen-broke through from all
sides and pounced, on us.

“OK kids,” the biggest cop said.
“What's the problem?”

“Oh, no problemuofﬁcer! ' We
just wanted to talk to people about
their lives and_...” . _ ‘

“I get" it,” the cop said’. _‘*What

‘.‘No sir, we aren’t. You see, we

now it was long after five o’clock,

and the street was much quieter. ‘A ,,

lone man staggered toward us.
“Hey, buddy,-got a quarter? I
need a soft pretzel-."’ .

__ _ “-Sorry, Ihaven’t__been able to find

my wallet all'day. Try her.”' ‘I
pointed at Sally, who glared and
took her purse off her shoulder.

The ‘drunk’ grabbed it and set a .

new world sprinting record across
Forbes. On the other side he
dumped the contents in his large

.overcoat pocket and threw the

purse in a trash can while we
watched. To takeS._ally’s mind off

the entire allocation process and
the competence of its members.
Why can idle‘ threats from certain
organizations net them unjustified
money? Perhaps more student
groups should resort to this tactic!
For example: Should the Pitt News

not cover campus events? Or what -

if WPGHV Radio dropped collegiate
sports? How about BAS threaten-
ing mass demonstrations? ' Would
this then increase these organiza-
tions’ budgets?

If the allocation process is one that

A can be swayed so easily, one can
' see it_has many holes and should be

strongly revised. A liberal aits
university such as Pitt is designed
to teach equalities, .justice and

_ fairness. ‘What better ‘place to start

along one of the residential streets. ‘
Several blocks off Forbes Avenue
there was less traffic. A 'small
group of people, of indefinite sex,
stood on the corner. One of them

hissed at me. .

“Excuse me,” I said. “I didn’t ,_
hear you." _  

“I said, you got any change,"
man?”-

“No, I lost my wallet today.”
' “Heyman, I mean you got any

nickels or dimes?” w

‘‘I’m _sorry, I don’t have any

“What are "you, ‘a wise-ass? You

,“Oh! I see--no,\ I’m sorry about
that, too.” I started to walk away.

carefully, trying to locate the

could decide where to look, Sally

I staggered out of the alley. L

sobbed.

‘ “I’m sorry, I couldn't tell where ‘

 Cry   Nigilrs’

 

 

, . BY RITA VITOLO
’ Pittsburgh was a quiet and unusually warm place yesterday
' afternoon, not at all like the country‘the man was describing. He used
to be an interpreter of Vietnamese for the US Marine Corps and
' recalled that the woman who had taught him the language had
probably elected to remain in Saigon with her husband, an ofﬁcer in’
-the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. V
A  Ba Hoam--Mrs. Hoam--was what he called her. He had never
learned her first name. And he did not doubt she would be listed in

’ "Saigon now as a collabrator. *

That former Marine was one of the 500,000 anonymous Americans
who became veterans of the war in Vietnam. Yesterday, less than 24
hoursafter it was all ofﬁcially‘over, he showed no bitterness about the
. war, but more than a willingness to talk. I
o A _“,1can’t be bitter,” the man was saying. “I thought, when I ﬁnally

got out, I'd hate the US government, I’d hate the Marine Corps, I’d

hate’ Kennedy and all those guys who got us into that mess. But who
could Ivblame? Vietnam was the product of the result of’ another war-
‘that itself wasreally forced upon us. It was dumb.’ It was all just
. fucking" dumb.”
.  He enlisted with the Marines late in 1967, after two years of disliking
I ‘A community college on the Northside. ,From the very first days at Parris
‘Islandithe recruits were taught “to hate gooks. Rice-propelled mother-
.-ofuckers, they called them. Lemon-colored men.”

, The ﬁrst day the recruits were given bullets on the practice range, a
manstanding not far away put the weapon to his head and ﬁred. The
.Marine noticed something wet on his face and looked down to see his
"hand and gun splattered with brains.

C “‘I, had expected it to end last Sunday,~when the Vietcong were
attacking Tan Son Nhut, the airbase,” the man said. “It’s been _
‘coming. I’ve seen it coming for a long time.

 “Icry some nights, when I think about it, I lasted, I got out. I knew a
"lot of guys who didn’t. One guy had just got married, and she was
pregnant, they let him have 20 days with his wife before she ‘had the
‘baby, before he went over. You couldn’t hate him. He really believed

a ‘what he was doing was right.
.  ‘ ‘He was there a month. He volunteered to walk a point and‘ a mortar

; round came in--sometimes when a mortar explodes in front of you like
-that,-, you don’t even get hurt. Dave blew into about 35 pieces. He
never knew what hit him. He probably never felt a thing.”

The Marine was with a replacement company in Oakland, California
with Vietnam orders to serve as part of a ﬁve-man assault group, the

kind of unit that frequently took 100% casualties in Vietnam. One day
he reported to the Oakland Naval Hospital, saying: “You’re tryingito
kill me, the VC are trying to kill me, the NVA are tryingto kill me, and
I'm not putting this uniform on again after .I take it off tonight,”

Total refugee management in the
Far East is under the management

reported. ' '

International Business Machines
(IBM) has donated $250,000 to the
Red Cross “for assistance to
Vietnamese refugees who are
being relocated on United States
soil,” Fenwick said. ' ‘

The Red Cross was notified
Tuesday that Red Cross relief
planes and ships would be
permitted to land at Da Nang, on
the northeast coast of what used to
be South Vietnam.

American families interested in
sponsoring Vietnamese refugees
may contact one of several groups,
all located‘ in New York City. The
groups are: the International

Church World Service, 870-2257;
Lutheran World Relief, 677-3950;

‘US Catholic Conference, 475-5400;-

United HIAS, 674-6800; and the

area codes are 212. _ _ _
The fall of the South Vietnamese ‘

government of Duong Van (Big)
Minh has relieved some problems
for Vietnamese students at Pitt, but
may have created_other problems.

A month ago, the question was,

_ what would happen to the students V

if Vietnam collapsed? Now, federal
agencies have taken steps to
provide for the students and efforts
are being made to locate relatives
of the students.

There are 11 Vietnamese stu-
dents at Pitt, according to foreign
student advisor Bill Lenaghen.

“The students aren’t interested
in talking to reporters," Lenaghen
said. “I have been in contact with
all 11 of them twice in reference to ~
calls from the media, and none of
the students have shown any
interest in talking.”

George O’Bannon, director of
International Student Services at

Pitt, said, “About three weeks ago

the Immigratioin and Naturaliza-
tion Service authorized the stu-
dents to accept employment. We
are anticipating that in about a
week there will be a further easing
of the normal immigration regula-
tions on the students‘. Whether
this means they will, put them
under docket control we -don’t
know.” Docket control means the
students)’ would not be required to

Bill Lenaghen added that the INS
is trying to work with the students
to bring their families to ‘Pitts-
burgh, if any of those families were
among the evacuated Vietnamese.
According to Lenaghen, familiesof
Pitt students were probably not
among those evacuated. 

The order of evacuation for
Vietnamese nationals, said Michael
Landon of Pittsburgh’s Ofﬁce of
the INS, was: “Parents and
brothers and-sisters of permanent
resident aliens were ﬁrst, followed
by high-risk Vietnamese,” deﬁned
as those who were closely
identiﬁed with the American

for evacuation. Students fall into

Editor Richard J . Anobile ex-
plains in the foreward, “This book
is a complete reconstruction of the
film, from opening to closing
credits.” Anobile’s exact duplica-
tion of scenes, camera set-ups and
dialogue is necessary to help the
book communicate the suspense of
the original movie thriller. The
inclusion of lap dissolves and

fades, a technique used in film to ,

aid the audience in crossing the
gap between scenes,
smooth transition and helps the
reader stay involved in the action.

The screenplay for the movie, -

written by Garrett Fort and Francis
Edwards Faragoh, is an adaptation
of Mary Shelley’s novel “Franken-
stein,’_’ but only the theme of a
scientist’s preoccupation with the
creation of new life remains in the
movie. .

Frankenstein’s terrifying search for
the power to give life.

filmviewer is able to leisurely
examine James WhaIe’s directing

more apt to find the film shot as if it ,

were a stage play, with the actors
playing to an audience that exceeds
the camera, which is always there
to follow their gestures and
expressions. ‘

Wha1e’s use of the close-up is
also limited, leaving important and
emotional scenes shot using a
medium or long shot. Upon close
inspection of the dialogue, the
reader can see as the ‘ﬁlm viewer
often can not, that some of the
scenes are simple, and some, in the
case of those between Dr.
Frankenstein and his fiancee
border on the ridiculous.

Despite ‘the inconsistencies of
the original movie, it remains a

A Pitt's Summersiock Game-C,

“In the good old summertime, in the good old summertime...”  If » s

summerstock. ’ ~

Yes folks, it's the time of year again to break out the straw hat and 3 - ' . 

cane. Many a twirling hat will take to the air on Pittsburgh area stages.

Here at Pitt, we've got our own summerstock in the making. .But .  
instead of sticking one more feather in the collective hat of  " 

Hammerstein, Rodgers, Lerner or Lowe, Pitt’s theatre department is
outstretching its arm to John Osborne.

' Most commercial theatrical organizations
financially prudent] shy away from “heavy” drama. “Summertime” I
still clouds their minds with images of white frilly lace, cool evening
breezes and mint julep. The humidity is all the “heaviness” through
which one can cut. ~ ' ‘

But Dick Mennen and cdmpany are retiring to the Porters’ one-room -   

Midland ﬂat wherethey will reside in Osbor_ne’s Look Back in Anger.
A play that has been bleeped as “tones of thunder” and “savage
drama” might cause the mint julep to sour.

And they take thisstep rather cautiously. With already one
box-ofﬁce failure to their name, they evened up the score at one and
one. Cabaret homered but Pantagleize never even got to bat. And

. with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, it is up to Look Back in Anger _' ‘_ 

to sway the past season of social revolt. ,
Now I don’t want to preach or reprimand. But Uncle Sam and Pitt’s
theatre department need you.’ They’ve taken the risk. And_ by

accepting thatchallenge, they’ve also made a value judgement on your. .  ‘-

taste, intellect and sensitivity. In other words, you’ve'got what it
takes, people. ' » '

' So while the Civic Light Opera and Heinz Hall run the gauntlet from 2 5 ; I

Once again, the heavens have

- conspired against the.Pitt baseball

team. .Tuesday’s encounter with
Bucknell was called off because of
wet grounds, andthe game most
likely will not be made up.

The Panthers’ _ next clash is

scheduled for Saturday in Morgan-‘ ’

town, when West Virginia will host

a double-header. The Mountainers _
still may be smarting from the’
twinbill thrashing Pitt gave tliem .
. earlier this month. The Panthers

won 7-1 and 4-2.

Thus far, excellent pitching has
been the main reason for Pitt’s 4-1
record. Southpaw Don Siegle leads
the staff with a 2-0 leg. In 13 2/3
innings, the senior from North
Catholic has.given up but 10 hits

. \ BYBOB COOPER

. LOUISVILLE AP--While other
trainers preferphrases such as “a

contentious ﬁeld,” Larry Spraker~

ﬂatly-says the ﬁeld for Saturday’s
Kentucky ‘Derby is only mediocre.

, “Let’s face_it, thispis just a ‘bad
year for 3-year-olds. ' It happens
every two’ or tliree years,” the
32-year-old former‘ jockey said._

and four earned runs.' His ERA is a
sound 2.65. Siegle is expected -to
pitch in one of the. WVU games.

Another senior pitcher, Jerry
Minsinger, is having a good spring.
Despite being the losing pitcher
against Buffalo last week, “Cool
Breeze” has been stingy in giving
up runs. He’s tossed two complete
games (7 innings in each--_double-

"headers do not go ‘nine innings in

college baseball), ’ allowing just
ninehits andvfour earned runs for
an ERA of 2.57.

Junior Don Kennedy also has a
2.57 earned run average, on the
merit of his fine performance in the
first Buffalo tilt. The only other
pitcher to see action in the young
season is Buster Popovich. He.
relieved Siegle in Pitt’s victory at
Penn State, striking out four Lions

in 2 "1/3 innings.

On "the offensive“ front, the
Panthers are not stinging the ball
with authority. They got only one
hit? in the first Buffalo contest and
are averaging less than seven hits
per game. ‘

Junior Bernie ‘Rossman tops the
squad with a .429 average (3 for 7).
Pete Marterelli is at an even .300 (3
for 10); Scott Sufrin“ and Lynn
Nystrom, both seniors, are clipping‘
the ball for .286,-averages (4 for 14).

,‘‘I’ve got the only horse that '

can run a mile and a quarter, and’

I’ve got a jockey who realizes the
strategy of the race and will sit and
wait,” Spraker said. ‘

.season games, posting a 7-1-2

came only because Parent was out

measure ‘our expectations as con,-

sumers against the realities of the
mass market. We must consider
what absolute product-perfection
would do to prices and volume.
Have you ever stopped to ‘think

what it would cost to build a tele-A

vision set that -would “never” fail

for wear out? Many thousands

‘of dollars. And the assembly and

inspection procedures would,pre-

clude more than a few thousand sets -

being built each year. Thus, the high
quality would be academic for
the majority of Americans, .who
would simply be priced out of the
market. ‘ ' ‘
Businessmen face a challenge; Do
they travel the low road? Cut cor-
ners, use the cheapest materials they

can get by with? Or do they take.

the high road——turning out each
product by hand, forgetting costs,
doing only “custom work” beyond
the ﬁnancial reach of millions of
cost-conscious average‘ Americans?
Wisely, realistically, American
business travels instead a “Main

/

Street,” where the aim’ is the best
product that can be made at a price
the mass of consumers can afford.
In shops and factories across the
country, engineers, designers, ,shop
foremen hold “product audits, ’ ex-

amining the‘-chain saw or tape re- '

corder or child’s toy before*them.i
With production costs rising, how
can they improve the product but
keep the price competitive? Will this
plastic compound be as strong ‘and as
workable as the now-too-costly met-

al it must replace? Sure, this transis- _

tor is cheaper, but will it do the job
as well? ,At the Rockwell Interna-
tional Corporation, engineers rede-

- signed a pocket calculator over a-nd

over again to cut the cost and time
of manufacture while improving the
reliability of the machine. -

The cumulative_eﬁ‘ect_ of such ac- _

tivities is a boon to the American

' consumer, especially during this dif-

ﬁcult economic period when all of
us want to stretch out dollars.as far

as possible. For‘, what good is an ,,

improved product if it isn’t‘ readily
available to everyone at a reasonable
price?»  -

The Main Street approach means
that there are 117 million TV sets in
"U. S. homes, 21 million dishwashers‘,
35 million clothes dryers—and it
means that by and large this abun-
dance of products is an abundance
of‘ good products, constantly being
improved because of competition".

Look at automobiles, for instance,
probably the most complex and
sophisticated -item the average con-
sumer will ever buy. Today’si cars
run much longer between engine
tune-ups, oil changes and lubrica-
tions ‘than earlier models. Their
brakes are much more reliable, their
cooling systemsrequire much less

' maintenance. v

“Consumer pressure” is a healthy-
afﬁrmation of the market system.
After all, what good would con-
sumer demands be in a society with-

out businesses competing in reaction - '

to those demands? Butveonsumer
pressure is no new phenomenon; it

' .is ratherthe same pressure that. has

always motivated the 'conscienti_ous
businessman—competition. _
Certainly, consumers ‘have the
right to complain, to send things.
back when they aren’t right. But
what really makes, American prod-
ucts the greatest bargains in the

world today—in both cost and per- V

formance—is the fact that all of
us constantly cast our votes in the
marketplace. It is‘ these consumer
“ballots” that shape the quality of
the goods we purchase day in and

TO BENEFIT PITT YMCA COMMUNITY SERVICE

Johnny Majors had’  see an
awful lot of things he enjoyed this
past Saturday afternoon".

While Pitt’s head coach lounged
in the press box, scanning" the ﬁeld
for smashing blocks and clean
execution, two gentlemen from the
local media--Pittsburgh Press
Sports Editor Pat Livingston, and
WIIC sportscaster Sam Nover--took
over Majors’ troops for the after-
noon at Pitt’s 1975 A, Blue-Gold
tussle. '

What Majors saw were pleasing
sights, such as Bobby Hutton

_showing everyone he is more than a

blocking back. The New Jersey
native ran wickedly for the Golds,
piling up 142 yards on 24 carries.

He saw two superb candidates
vying for-Bill Daniels’ quarterback
position. Sophomore Matt Cavan-
augh led his Gold team like a
poised leader in battle. He is, at
this time, not the frontrunner for
the job, but after performing
Saturday, he turned a lot of heads
around. Scrambling» for 61 yards to
complement his throwing (8 for 23,

"90"yards), Cavanaugh gave Robert

Haygood _a couple of things to think
about. -

Haygood was sly and crafty, a
real burglar. His speed enabled
‘him to garner 88 yards on the
ground while throwing adequately

A plethora.of new faces in battle
made Majors smile a bit, too. Jim
Cramer, a guy who never got a
chance at Ohio State, played mid-
dle linebacker for the Blues as
though he were a Butkus-reincam-
ate. . » '

It was a day that will keep
Majors’ mind churning with the
endless possibilities the autumn
should bring. The summer will
