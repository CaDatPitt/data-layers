Bill To Teach Unemployed

By WES COTTER

Unemployed people may soon
be able to take career-related
courses free of charge at state-
owned colleges.

A bill will be presented to the
Pennsylvania State Legislature
this week that would allow the
unemployed to attend classes
where space is available.

The bill is being presented by
state representative Elinor Taylor,
R-Chester. Taylor said, “There has
been thought of including the four
state-related universities to the bill
by amendment."

If this amendment is passed,
along with the proposed bill, Pitt
will become part of a program.

The proposed legislation is
made up of two parts. The first is a
program that will help the unem-
ployed find jobs by providing
seminars on practical job skills and
writing and interviewing skills.

Taylor said these are support
courses that help the jobless.
“They just don't feel good about
themselves,” she said.

The second part of the bill per-
tains to the courses that the unem-
ployed would attend. Taylor
stressed several points, saying that
“the classes would definitely relate
to jobs."

Taylor described the types of
fields that people would be inter-
ested in; she gave the computer and
medical fields as examples.

The program will include only
the courses in which each college
has space available.

“No attempt was made to suit
courses for colleges,” Taylor said.
She added that “the courses that
colleges would offer would be con-
sidered on a career-oriented basis."

The present form of the bill
would give it a life of one year with
the possibility of extention, much
like other state bills, Taylor said.

This type of program is cur-
rently being tested at two private
schools in the state. Mercyhurst
and Mount Aloysius both have
unemployment education pro-
grams already underway.

Taylor said, “Lots of good news
has come from it; both programs
are off and running.

“It’s not a panacea; it's conscious
of the situation at hand. We are not
in the majority, and I have reserva-
tions, but Ithink public pressure
gives it a good chance.”

According to Taylor, the college
presidents with whom she has
spoken are in favor of the bill, but
some top administrators see prob-
lems with it.

Pennsylvania. higher education
commissioner James Gallagher
said the jobless “tend to be inter-
ested in areas that are
over-enrolled.”

Pitt chancellor Wesley Posvar
said, “I think that Gallagher's
point is correct, unemployed
workers would not enroll in
French literature or Greek history;
they would enroll in computer
courses, which are just chock full
now.

“What the unemployed workers
need is not college courses. They
need job retraining so that they can
move into other kinds of skills and
careers," Posvar said.

Posvar said that Pitt is already
working on accessing job retrain-
ing requirements, but the kind of
instruction a university gives is not
suited to this program. Posvar sug-
gested that a community college or

Computer Force
To Assess Needs

By PATTI VISHNESKY

The Task Force for Academic
Computing has found two major
trends in its research for the univer-
sity’s computers needs and goals.

After receiving some 30 assess-

ments, the trends are toward diver- _

sified computers and an increase in
the interaction between individu-
als and machines.

The task force, headed by Dr.
Norman Bardsley, began its plan-
ning last December after the former
three—year plan failed to provide
the needed computer power. Since
then, the task force has been search-
ing for an adequate computer
system.

In the area of diversified compu-
ters, a need is shown for‘ greater
decentralization. There is a need to
set up local computer facilities for
tasks such as text processing.

Increasing interaction means to
incorporate micro- and personal
computers because different com-
puters are needed for different
needs within the various
departments.

This trend has lead the task force
to look toward some type of com-
puter network throughout the
university.

Currently, there are many micro-
computers throughout the univer-
sity, but they areunable to “talk”
to each other. A network, however,
would meet the needs of the various
departments by enabling those
computers to transmit information
such as library information or
video information.

According to Bardsley, the task
force will begin implementing its
plan during the next academic
year. By the fall, he said, he hopes
there will be a university. policy on
text processing. Two VAC 780s
have been ordered and will be
introduced during the next aca-

demic year and will be operating by
Jan. 1_, 1984.

Wayne Slawson, vice-chairman
of the Executive Committee for
Academic Computing, said there
are three issues which he sees as
central in the needs assessment.
First, a decision must be made to
how much access should be
granted to faculty, staff and stu-
dents and what distinction should
be made between a graduate and an
undergraduate student.

Secondly, since Pitt is a large
university, standardization is
needed. During the process of
investing a large amount of money
into a large computer, the hard-
ware for such a computer would
not be as complicated if it were all
programmed the same way. There-
fore, some type of standard should
be set as to the types of computers
workable on the network and how
much leeway is allowed in swaying
from the “Pitt” standard.

Finally, there is the issue of
money. According to Slawson, the
committee will be recommending
an amount to spend on the system.
Slawson said the committee should
be concerned about from where the
money will come. ‘

Paul Steinman, the director of
the computer center, said the con-
cern lies in quality service. As the
environment and technology

change, the university needs _a sys-

tem that will be able to provide.
adequate services as these changes
occur.

In order to evaluate the various
computer vendors and their com-
puters, Wayne Baughman‘ of the
Computer Center and his commit-
tee sent a list of specification from
the university community for them
to consider. As of March 31, 12
proposals have been submitted by
the vendors

While we at Pitt are cramming
for finals, many college students
are basking in the Florida sun on
their spring breaks. Pitt, how-
ever, has no spring vacation. An
early dismissal may give Pitt stu-
dents a jump on summer jobs,
but it is not a substitute for the
fun and sun in Ft. Lauderdale.

Although the Winter Term is
lacking a spring break, many
believe they have invented the
next best thing~the annual
“Spring Fling."

“It is a good way for students
to release their pressure of
finals," Bob Peters, co-
coordinator of this year’s Spring
Fling, said. “Since Pitt has no
spring break, we have to make
our own."

This year’s ﬂing is larger than
ever. The events list anywhere
from softball to~—everybody’s
favorite~—mud wrestling.

The idea of Spring Fling was
brought here by Ken Buetow, the
resident director ofthe quad resi-
dent halls. In 1979, Buetow, then
a resident assistant, presented
the idea of a spring festival to the
Office of Residence Life (ORL),
Resident Student Association
(RSA) and other student organi-

zations. The idea took off, and

Spring Fling Relieves
Pre-Final Pressures

has grown ever since.

“Ken was the brain child of
Spring Fling,” Peters said. “He
got the idea from his old
school—lndiana University-—
and said that Pitt should have a
spring carnival, too.”

The quad resident assistant
staff is organizing Spring Fling
with the help of various student
organizations.'The sponsors this
year are Pitt Program Council
and the Stroh’s Brewing A
Company.

Stroh’s is sponsoring a new
event called “College Book of
Records.” According to Peters,
the event resembles the Almost
Anything Goes Competition, in
which the participants engage in
a series of outlandish events
while attempting to set records.

Spring Fling is not just all fun
and games—valuable prizes will
be awarded to the top finishers.
Among the prizes are pizzas, gift
certificates and dinners.

“The surrounding merchants
really responded well to us this
year,” Joe Ferretti, another co-
coordinator, said.

Peters is expecting 400-500
students to participate in this
year‘s Spring Fling, which runs
from Tuesday, April 5 to Sun-

Part of Pitt’s Past: The Cathedral of Learningw

By MARY ANN KRUPA

Since 1787, when the Honorable
Hugh Henry Brackenridge and a
group of backwoodsmen built a log
cabin and named it Pittsburgh
Academy, the University of Pitts-
burgh has made tremendous strides.
One of the most signiﬁcant achieve-
ments along the way was the erec-
tion of the Cathedral of Learning
because it represented both an ideal
of learning on the part of Pitt's
ambitious former chancellor, John
G. Bowman, and a new and bold
approach to functional architecture.

The story of how the Cathedral
came to be is as interesting as the
building itself. It is the product of a
generation of Pittsburghers who
were driven to establish the image of
Pitt in the eyes of the nation and the
world as a place unique and inspira-
tional in which to get an education.

When the university first moved
into the Oakland district in the early
part of the century, Chancellor Wil-
liam Jacob Holland had supervised
the establishment of the Schools of
Pharmacy, Medicine, Law and
Mines. The existing buildings were
inadequate for containing them.

In 1892, a competition of archi-
tects was held for a proposed scheme
of buildings to be erected in the
S_c_h_eii1ey_ Park (_listric_t.»T.he result of

  ‘Get that
Great “:6”

§_‘.I2i 3», ;,‘.~‘g_a. ,‘,_\.,.,“;'r‘ V’.

this competition was a plan that
would include some 50 squat, ram-
bling buildings to be spread out over
the hillsides much the way the Greek
Athenium was designed. The School
of Mines and Thaw Hall were com-
pleted as part of this original
scheme, and in 1909 the Engineering
and Mining School moved into the
two buildings.

Later, the plan was abandoned,
and buildings were erected as they
were needed, without regard, to the
original system.

When Bowman took office in
1921, he immediately began cam-
paigning for a towering structure
that would relieve the overcrowded
conditions at the university with its
campus in the heart of the city.

In 1926, ideas for the structure
were unified, and a definite style and
composition was decided upon.

The campaign to raise money for
the building became a Pittsburgh
obsession, according to historian
Agnes L. Starrett. Pittsburghers
were stirred to action by Bowman’s
appeal that the building represented
the same courage and honesty that
had gone into the building of the
city.

“The building will symbolize the
hope, the struggle and the achieve-
ment of Pittsburgh,” Bowman said.
“It will interpret for the world what
Pittsburgh is—its intellectual and

V

spiritual force inseparable from its
industry...The Cathedral of Learn-
ing will place Pittsburgh high as a

leader in the field of learning and of .‘

the application of knowledge to
community service. It will give the
boys and girls of Pittsburgh a chance
to live in usefulness and happiness to
their full capacity."

Bowman wanted the building to
be high, he said, not simply for the
purpose of saving space, but“for the
power of inspiration and for the sub-
limity which great height together
with the right proportions, mass,
lines, carvings, friezes and pointed
Gothic arches can give.”

The rooms were designed also to
allow the greatest ﬂexibility. Any
space in the building can be used as a
library, recitation room, lab or shop,
as the circumstances from time to
time require.‘

Pittsburgh industry moved to
back the plan for the cathedral with
its full strength, at the urging of_Car-
negie Steel Company president

Homer D. Williams.

In the first three months of the
building campaign drive, the people
of Pittsburgh, both wealthy and
poor, pledged the $10 million
needed to begin the project——$8 mil-
lion for the building itself and $2
million for the 16 acres of land.

Starrett said that the name
“Cathedral of Learning” was chosen
during the campaign since it came
nearest to “the spirit of the building
in architecture and in purpose.” It
became a symbol for the university
itself, and pictures of the proposed
structure were displayed all over
Pittsburgh. It appeared in schools,

gin restaurants, in homes and in

 had they contributed

so much
money toward one cause. Phrases
from booklets describing the build-
ing, were heard everywhere: “Our
university;” “Sincerity like the ring
of Steel;” “Meat to eat that you

know not of.”

In the fund-raising campaign of

. 1925, l7,000 men and women and

97,000 school children gave toward
the building of the Cathedral.

,5 Larger gifts were supplied by the

Western Pennsylvania industries

\ and business corporations such as

H.J. Heinz, Jones and Laughlin,
Mellon Bank, People's Natural Gas

E and others.

The school children were asked
not only to solicit donations but also
to share some of their own money,
and each child who contributed was
awarded a certificate of pledge,
much like the ones given to adults.

The architect Charles Z. Klauder
was selected to design the building to
suit the chancellor’s idea of “height
suggesting education stretching to
the infinite” and to fit the practical
needs of the university.

Work on the Cathedral pro-
gressed steadily for the next three
years after ground was broken, but
in 1929, work halted with the

. .. (:3

Depression, and the building stood
idle, with the steel ribs on the lower
floors exposed where the stone work
had not been completed.

It stood still until 1934 when the
Civil Works Administration of the
New Deal resumed work on the
building as part of its program.

After the CWA grant was
exhausted, Chancellor Bowman
began another campaign to finish
the work and raise $1,650,000 cal-
ling it the “Complete the Cathedral”
drive. The Cathedral was completed
the following year.

day, April 10. The weather ofthe
week will have an impact on the
. turnout, Peters said.

Although Spring Fling’s pur-
pose is to relieve pre-finals ten-
sion, many students may shy
away because of finals. 4

“It may backfire because it is
the last week before classes end,”
Ferretti said, “but we are hoping
that students will budget their
time and that the Pitt spirit will -
come through.”

The Men’s Best Legs Contest
and Street Hockey are also two
new Spring Fling events. Once
again, Bob’s Burger Barn will
feature the cuisine.

The coordinators are hoping
for more involvement from all
the academic class in next year‘s
Spring Fling. This is a crucial
time because all the people in
charge of this year’s fling are
graduating, Peters explained.

Spring Fling is open to any
interested student. Applications‘
for the various events are availa-
ble at the ORL and RSA offices
and in The Pitt News.

Task Force
Assesses

continued from page one

Within the university specifica-
tions, it was stated that Pitt did not
feel that any one manufacturer
could meet all the needs of the uni-
versity and that it would not
endorse any one line of products.

Currently, many faculty
meml)ers have and are using micro-
computers (in their offices, eventu-
ally, they will have to acquire
standard micro-computers (if
theirs are not) in order to work with
the new system.

The reason for this is that differ-
ent micro-computers use different
characters, and it is impossible for
the network software to l)e stand-
ardized for all arbitrary micro-
computers.

With the standardization of com-
puters at Pitt comes an intent over
time. Theintent is that the univer-
sity will provide an easier acquisi-
tion or renting of micro-computers
at a campus store at discount prices
for faculty, staff and students.

No decision along these lines has
yet been made, but the committee is
hoping that a local store will open
that will sell a broad line of compu-
ter products.

By the end of its planning, the
task force will have a better idea of
what type of computing people
will be doing and what systems are
best suited for the university.

Traffic CopOn New Pursuit

For 31 years, Vic Cienca has
begun his work day by donning
a pair of white gloves. He then
would proceed at his job as"a
director—a traffic director, that
IS.

Veteran policeman Vic
Cianca, who just recently
retired, was one of Pittsburgh's
most visual celebrities. Every
day motorists would be met
with a friendly smile or a some-
times outlandish gesture while
passing through Cianca’s Lib-

erty Ave. intersection. His t

memorable traffic directions
and friendly disposition truly
earned him the title of Pitts-
burgh’s finest.

Pitt students were treated, to
Cianca's amusing antics while
he directed traffic for football
games. On the corner of DeSota
and Forbes, Cianca braved the

unstoppable. buses, not to men- 
tion the thousands of crazed =
fans, onjtheir way up Cardiacg.

Hill.

‘_‘I loved it," Cianca said. "1 ‘I

related to the college kids
instead of acting like Barretta.
Although Cianca’s job as at

policeman was to’ maintain 

order, he rarely had» any prob‘-
lems at Pitt games. ‘

“Pitt has always seemed to be.
on the winning side, and kids
would kiss and hug me," he
laughed. “They would also
invite me for drinks, but I told
them I would be directing the
wrong way ifI took them up on
their invitation.”

Cianca'a fame has been
spread coast-to-coast on televi-
sion and just recently in movies.
He won the highest award

given by the T.V. show ‘‘Can- -

did Camera" when they put his
traffic directing movements to
concert music. Cianca however,
was unable to accept the award
because his superior officer said

_ he was an officer of the law, not

a television star. '
He has been featured on
“Real People," “On the Road

’With Charles Kuralt," “AM

Pi-ttsburgh’and»-in anew movie
“Flash Dance,” which willbe
released in July.

Cianca started the traffic

" policeman tradition of wearing

white gloves. Before Cianca's

precedent, ‘white gloves were ‘
only worn at funeralsfand spe-

cial occasions.
“The white gloves gave a
clear signal to the motorist,"

g ._I(-Iianca said. “I kept it up asa
‘ trade mark." ‘

P Perfectly
Clear

Pitt’s Board of Trustees has announcedyg»
with unmistakeable clarity that it intends to‘
- ignore the wishes of students.

‘The trustees recently reappointed Tom
Hajduk as student representative to the
board, disregarding a request by the Stu-
dent Government Board (SGB-) to allow
SGB input into the choice. The most sting-
ing blow to students came when Dr. John
Quatrochle, the secretary of the university,
wrote to Pennsylvania education secretary
Robert Wilburn that the disagreement was

i T the result of students’ misunderstanding
 i- . university procedures and claimed that the
if SGB “has agreed to work with Mr?
g. ' V Hajduk.’’ ‘

  i That would have been a happy resolu-
B tion to the problem, but Quatroche’s letter
was dated several days prior to the meeting
at which SGB made its feelings known to
-  .. him. ’ .

if  V ‘ The SGB_‘sent a letter to Chancellor Pos-
‘' var, airing L its complaints against this
procedure and announcing that it feels
“abandoned” by the administration.

Both the trustees’ initial decision and
Q_uatroche’s subsequent letter. leave no
doubt that the administration intended
 ‘ A p ' completely to disregard student opinion.

i By not consulting with the SGB before
‘appointing a student representative to the
Board_ of Trustees, the administration has
shown that student_involvement in that
area is regarded as token and insignificant.
The SGB is rightly working to make it more
difficult to bypass the students in the future.
If the new student representative to the
board, Tom Hajduk, is not asked" to resign
and the SGB is not given approval to begin
' its own search for a student representative,
the SGB will notify the state house of the
situation, call a press conference and with-
draw all student representatives from all
university committees, councils and
governing bodies.

._Understandably, the SGB has expressed
that it feels slighted and deserving of better
treatment. The administration has brought

will have to face.

Letters-~To The Editor

Trustees’ Choice Unfair

Dear Editor:

RC(T€Il[ (‘V€l'llS have ()C(‘UI”Y(’(l Ell .

the University of Pittsburgh which
raise the question of how ruuch the
administration cares about student

opinion‘; The closing of academic P

departments, the possible chang-
ing of Schenley Hall's name and
most recently, the administration’s
renomination of the student-
appointed member of the Board of
Trustees, leads the Student
Government Board to believe that
the university wishes not to include
students in on processes which
affect them.‘

In the 19605, students pursued
rallies and protests as a means to
satisfy their goals. However, those
radical ways have dwindled and are
being replaced by diplomatic and
professional bargaining on the
part of the students. At the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, the administra-
tion seems to not respect such up-
front and straightforward tactics
and, instead, uses unfaithful and
clandestine actions.

The automatic renomination of
Tom Hajduk as the student
member of the Board of Trustees
was done with absolutely no stu-
dent input, as in the past. Not only
did the administration privately
admit that this act was an “over-
sigh_t" on their part but also asked
the Student Government Board not
to make this blunder public in
order to avoid embarrassment.
Therefore, in all due respect to the
university and its administrators,
the Student Government Board
sought private means to insure that
such a mistake would not happen
again, in addition to making sure
the renominated person was aware
of his responsibilities to his student
constituency.

However, by coincidence, it
came to the Student Goverr-.nent
Board's attention that the secretary
of the university had written a let-
ter to the Pennsylvania Secretary of
Education five days before any
such agreement or proposal was
presented by the Student Govern-
ment Board.

This letter contained false and
presumptuous statements concern-
ing the normal process for the reap-

- pointment of a student member to
T the Board of Trustees. (When asked

it

  

., -t. .~ s.
*5 ir§.i',_c if» '-V;.__‘. ,4“;

to produce a written‘ document
stating this exact reappointment
process for members who have
served only a partial term. as did
Mr. Hajduk, Dr. Quatroche
stressed to the Student Government
Board that this procedure was ’a
practiced one.) The letter also
assumed further action which was
to be taken by the Student Govern-

ment Board and confirmed the uni— _

versity's unauthorized and
illegitimate recommendation
endorsing Mr. Hajduk for
reappointment. B

This‘ letter again substantiates
the lack of concern on‘ the adminis-
tration’s behalf for student partici-

pation. Instead of directly
confronting the students, the.
administration insists on bypass-
ing student opinion.

The Student Government hopes
that all students realize the grave

"'injustice that the administration

has inflicted on student rights. The
need for a qualified representative
student member on the Board of
Trustees is essential. In order to-
obtain such a person, it is incon-
ceivable that students would not be
included in the selection process.

Dear Editor:

Did you catch the coverage of
the Oxford/Cambridge crew
race the other day? Well. I did,
and it gotme thinking: why not
a crew team right here at Pitt?
It's very inexpensive (after the
initial purchase of a boat, the
sport is virtually cost free),
we've three usable rivers near by
/and for an English sport, it's
pretty exciting.

Just think about it. Here's a
chance to have clean, cheap fun,
playing the local colleges and
establishing some tradition in
the process. Now, the beauty of

it is that if we act on this soon,
we'll get a jump on the other
schools and totally dominate
Western Pennsylvania crewing
for at least several years, thus
increasing our national
exposure.

And remember, just about
any student with arms could go
out for the team. We could all
participate in a varsity sport,
take lots of coke, get a negative
QPA and get so blindly drunk
that we jump out of buildings
and beat up women in bars.

Bill Educates Unemployed

continued from pqge one

fa vocational technical school

would be better for retraining the
unemployed. I
. An employee of the State Bureau
of Unemployment, who wished to
have his name withheld, said,
"There’s a need for any type 0
training at any time." V ,
Paul Popovich, an assistant
registrar, said, “It seems likea good
idea, but it's a big logistics
problem." . E
’ Popovich went on to explain
that currently Pitt has no idea what
course is available until after the

I add-drop period is over.

Another problem with'the new
bill is the state auditing system,
which currently only handles pay-
ing customers. “If the system. is
first-come, first-serve, when do we
decide we can open agclass to the
unemployed? Do we judge? Do we
give priority to paying students?”
Popovich asked.

These questions have not yet

been addressed, and Popovich said
that if. this program were adopted,

the current system would have to be‘
changed.

A key element of this project is
the participation of the unem-
ployed. Ted Rudy, an unemployed
steel worker, expressed interest in
the program but said, “If they
threw me in a class, I'd be in trou-
ble. I’d have to start from scratch in
a basic math to pursue a skill such
as drafting, which could become
my new trade. .There’s no way I
could know today's math.

“I think it’s more politically
oriented than it is for the people. I
‘think the schooling’s going to be a
total failure. What happens after
the first year? You have a year of
school and you’re a family man,
then the program folds and you’re
left high and dry.” 

Lawrence Taylor, a steel worker
who has been out of work for
nearly a year, said, “I probably
would [go back to school], but I
don’t know. I have a family, and
someone has to foot the bills at

home. Why retrain for another job?.

Why train welders when welders
are laid off?"

Towers to the Cathedral of Learn-
ing). Posvar explained.

Although the sidewalks were not
widened, PAT did install two sec-
tions of railing in front of the Tow-
ers stairs « and the Book Center.
However, the entire block has yet to
be furnished with the railing. .

According to Posvar, the prob-
lem now is that no one is willing. to
pay for the installation.

“When they (PAT) were build-
ing the buslane, they accepted the

I Posvar Upset Over Committment

responsibility to install it and pay
for it," Posvar said.

Since the buslane was built in
November of 1981, there has been
one serious accident as well as sev-
eral minor ones.

“What concerns me the most is
when large groups of people are
going to class, a student may unin-
tentionally get pushed into the bus
lane," Posvar said.

Posvar is hoping to get some
immediate action from PAT to
solve this problem.

Whom did you put into office as
your representative? What powers
do they have in terms of making
student life better?

“We have established our credi-
bility by being responsible and
respectable,” said Mark Downs,
current Student Government
Board (SGB) president. “We know
that it is important to have the facts
straight.” .

Recently, however, the SGB was
told by Dr. John R. Quatroche,
secretary of the university that it did
not have its facts straight. The issue
of reappointment to the Board of
Trustees without student input is
the cause of some tension between
administrators and the SGB.

SGB had been working with
administrators in putting together a
nominating process to put a student
on the Board of Trustees.

As reported in The Pitt News last
Friday, Quatroche told Downs that
he was following normal nominating
procedures and that Downs had
been misinformed about them.

Quatroche was unavailable for
comment.

Todd DeLuca, former SGB presi-
dent, said that for the past three
years, there has been an impass
between the students and the
administrators.

— “This is the first year in my expe-
rience that I have seen a head-to-
head clash with administrators and
students,” he said.

SGB member Mindy Goldberg
said that “at this point, I can’t look at
the administration as a whole. I see
them as two separate groups-
administrators and top administra-
tors.

“It’s hard to trust top administra-
tive credibility in dealing with stu-
dents,” Goldberg said. “Before this
happened, I was all for nice diplo-
matic means to solve problems.

“We agreed to work with them,
and they tried to makeit as if we
didn’t know what was going on
when in fact, we did.”

Downs said that this is a very sen-
sitive issue right now and that he
would not comment about the
situation.

Joyce Giangarlo, assistant direc-
tor of student activities and adviser
for the SGB, said that “in lieu of the
way the students started this pro-
cess, this never should have
happened.”

“I don’t know to what degree stu-
dent input should occur and does
occur,” Dennis Donham, assistant

vice-chancellor for student affairs,

said.

The university doesn't have to do
certain things, he said, but it
chooses to do certain things.

“They [administration] are cer-
tainly affected by the SGB,” Don-
ham said, adding that the Board of
Trustees issue was “certainly not a
conspiracy or a screw job.”

Another area of concern for the
SGB is the closing of the Internship
Office.

Mark Downs was quoted in last
Wednesday's Pitt News as saying

President Downs and members _$tr;am, Greene and Lecce

Student

that the proposed closing had
caught him completely by surprise
and that the administration had not
informed him of it at all—he had
learned of the closing through The
Pitt News.”

Goldberg, who has been working
on an alternative to closing the
office, said “It looks to me that if the
Internship Office closes, it will be
gone and we will lose the service. A

“Budget cuts have to happen, but
I just don’t agree with where [they]
are being made,” Goldberg said.

She said that it appears to her that
cuts are always made in areas that
affect students most, giving exam-
ples of recent cutbacks in the advis-
ing center and cutting the

. geography department.

Goldberg said that she is planning
a petition, which she will distribute
to all relevant administrators to
keep the Internship Office open to
students.

She is currently looking for alter-
natives to the closing. --

“I am vehemently opposed to the
whole thing,” she said.

Donham said that student input
to budvretary decision-making is
extremeiy impractical.

“We are hired to take a certain
budget and create wide expertise
out of it,” he said. “Outsiders just
don’t realize the problems involved.
,Luxury creates dollar problems.

“In this case, the input would not
have led us to a different decision,”
he said. “We think we know how
students feel. in this particular ser-
vice, and we would agree with the
students that it is a good service, but
we had no real practical

     

alternative.”

“Any individual’s needs are
shaped by one’s experiences,” said
Nancy Denhart, director of the
Internship Office. “I think it is rea-
sonable and proper for the SGB to
look into those needs.”

“Student Government is most
interested in protecting undergrad-
uate interests. They see it as their
job to investigate and protect,” she
said. .

She said that if a service, oppor-
tunity or option is eliminated from
the student college life, then it is a
matter of legitimate concern.

T

1985

“Where there is a strong concern,
university administrators can be
sensitive,” Denhart said, “but you
cannot create dollars out of
concern.”

The SGB, according to Denhart,
cannot change the decision because
it can’t allocate money to the office.

“Short of allocating dollars from
their own budget, they have done
everything they could,” she said.

According to Downs, he had‘. 9

worked on the problem a couple of
days in advance before he
addressed the issue publicly in a let-
ter to the editor of The Pitt News.

Goldberg said that there were 725
students who made an average of
three visits each who used the
Internship Office in the past six
months.

Mindy Goldberg:

‘It’s very hard to

trust administativem

cred|bll|ty...they
trlod to make It as If
we didn’t kn6w"Wﬂ'£‘I'
was golng on when,
In tact,we dld.’

It takes approximately $20,000 to
run the office each year, according
to Downs.

“This student government is the
first since 1980 that has ever written

demands to the administration
through The Pitt News,” Todd De-
Luca said.

The Student Government Board
at Pitt seems to be in the middle of
the range of sizes of student govern-
ments at various universities and
the impact that they have within the
school.

In the Student Administration,
the governing body in West Virginia
University, the student body (21,000
students) elects a president and
vice-president, who in turn appoint
a treasurer.

The students also elect a 12-
member Board of Governors, who
are responsible for apporoving

appointments within the Student \..

Administration, according to
Melanie Cook, assistant director of
the department of housing and resi-
dence life at WVU.

They don’t do a lot of dealing
directly with the students, accord-
ing to Cook, but they approve
appointments for the chairmanships
of various committees within the
student government.

“The board does not carry a lot of

weight,” Cook said, “but the Stu- ‘

dent Administration as a whole does
regard many issues within the stu-
dent body.”

Penn State, on the other hand,
has an extensive student govern-
ment which is “very, very similar to
the United States government,”
according to Darryl Daisey, who is
very active in it.

The Undergraduate Student
Government (USG) has three
branches, headed by a president
and vice-president who are elected
by the student body (35,000
undergraduates).

“This is really a bureaucracy,”
Daisey said. “[The USG] is pretty
intense.”

The Executive Branch is respon-
sible for various departments within

the USG, such as the political affairs
department, which promotes stu-
dent involvement in politics, and the
department of communications,
which releases--information to local
newspapers and the school
newspaper.

Other departments under the
Executive Branch are the depart-
ment of women’s concerns, which
provides information about a variety
of subjects to women, including the
ERA, rape, etc., and the department
of minority affairs, which helps
minority students adjust to the
campus.

They also are responsible for the
Legal Relations Board, which helps

students in legal matters and offers '

legal advice.

There is also an Executive Coun-
cil, which consists of the presidents
of all the major student organiza-
tions on campus.

The Legislative Branch of the
USG consists of two houses, the
Senate and the Academic
Assembly.

The Senate comprises 35 elected
representatives from various loca-
tions on the campus, and the Aca-
demic Assembly directs their
attention to academic matters
within the university, such as tutor-
ing and grading policies.

The Judicial Branch is made up of
three counts: the Supreme Court,
the Elections Court and the Appeals
Court.

Since all of the student organiza-
tions receive their charter from the
USG at Penn State, the function of
the Supreme Court is to keep tabs
on these organizations and make
sure they areactive and spending
their funds appropriately.

The SGB at Pitt has been working
on several different projects on cam-
pus, but will they be completed by
the end of the term and will the next
board care to complete them?

According to DeLuca, major pro-
jects can't be completed within one
year and usually, when a new board
enters office, other projects become
more important and they lose
enthusiasm about old projects.

He said that different projects are
important to different people in the
university. For example, last year
the student health fee was a top
priority.

This year's goals include the
Internship Office, finding a better
way of appointing students to the
Board of Trustees and offering
LSAT preparatory tests profession-
ally yet inexpensively.

Getting together a Student
Assembly Committee, where stu-
dents meet and bring up new ideas,
problems and possible solutions to
the SGB and each other is another
of their long-term goals.

Other goals for the board include
getting benches at campus bus
stops, starting a student survey
committee, changing the current
withdrawal policy and addressing
the tuition issue.

“Students shouldn't expect their
Student Government Board to
change the course of the university
administration,” DeLuca said.

“This university asks a lot of its
students," Donham said. “SGB
members can get to see who they
want—quickly, and they usually get
direct answers to their questions.”

He said that he guesses there was
an unfortunate lack of communica-
tion in dealing with the Board of
Trustees in the student representa-
tion issue.

?Gouernment Board  

According to Donham, however,
“The Board of Trustees is a self-
perpetuating body that can do a lot
of things on their own and no one
can tell them what to do.”

According to Downs, SGB’s
power comes from the fact that they
can make their point clear by speak-
ing with the administration in an
adult manner.

“The 1960s are no longer here,
and the way to get things done on
campus is through discussions with
the key administrations,” he said.

Tuition increases seem to be the
one thing that does affect all stu-
dents, but what can be students'do
about them?

Joyce Giangarlo said the only way
student government can be effec-
tive is by informing students and

‘ Students shouldn’t
expect their student
government board
to change the
course of the
administration.’

raising their awareness of why it is
happening and where their student
dollars are going.

Jeff Schaffer, an SGB member,
said that the SGB can put pressure
on the administration in different
ways by asking and complaining
about things, but that “students are
not going to have political power.”

“There are so many ins and outs
involved with tuition increases that
you can't come out and say that you
don’t want a tuition raise,” Schaffer
said. “lt’s just not feasible.”

Board member Craig_Murphy
said that “we are not the first people
the administration comes running to
when they are making a tuition hike
decision.”

Three years ago, the SGB in
office approved that funding for the
Student Union be taken from tui-
tion, meaning that some portion of
tuition hikes are already build in,
according to Murphy.

He said that the SGB could take a
political stand on the issue of tuition
hikes, but that there is “not enough
activity from students to warrant
that.”

Murphey said that the SGB is
studying the problem and that at a
regular meeting a few weeks ago, a
proposal recommending a tuition
freeze was brought up by the
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee.

“We want [the proposal] to the
credible before it can be proposed
to the administration,” he said.

The SGB does have decision-
making power over other student
dollars such as the Student Activi-
ties Fee. SGB appoints an Alloca-
tions Committee consisting of nine
full-time undergraduate students.

This committee makes recom-
mendations on the recognized sta-
tus of student organizations» and
allocates activities fee dollars to
them.

 
 

 

James Shelton, chairperson of
the Allocations Committee, said
that it holds interviews with each
organization to discuss that organi-
zations financial needs. The Com-
mittee then submits its recommen-
dations to SGB.

“We are not guessing at what they
need, they tell us what they need,”
Shelton said. ’

The committee and SGB do not
always agree on the budgets, but
according to Shelton, “The system
works”—only 3 out of 70 budgets
heard were controversial.

When the SGB cannot come to
an agreement on the budget, it is
sent back to the Allocations Com-
mittee for a second reviewing. The
organization is then notified of the
board’s decision.

A final approval must have the
affirmative vote of at least five, and if
rejected, the board must recon-

-struct those parts or entire budget

within one week, with the approval
of at least six board members.

“Specifically, we are not in the
business of telling a group how to
operate,” Murphey said. “We look
at the goals of the group and make
sure it is not a duplication of other
groups, which provides consistency
and fairness.”

“They see themselves as the con- '

science of the university,” and they
speak out about what they think,
said Giangarlo.

' “They do their homework;
they're not just screaming.”
“Because we are students, one
tends to be in tune to student con-
cerns, but it is hard without a lot of
student input,” Goldberg said.

Donham said, "I would rate them
very high for what they have done.
They have students assigned to key
committees, and they are not bash-
ful; they do ask that matters be clari-
fied if they don’t understand
something.” '

Jeff Schaffer said, “We are nine
people—nine individuals—and can
pick up other students’ concerns
through our own interactions out-
side of student government. With
the exception that we can bring
back and discuss the issue and con-
tact administrators.

“The part that students don't see
is that we are trying to do something
for them, and at the same time, not
lose communication with the admin-
istration,” Schaffer said.

Every undergraduate student has

the rightvto vote for the SGB presi— ,

dent and board members. a total of
nine, in an at-large election held dur-
ing the second week of November
each year.

The president and board
members must have a minimum
QPA of 2.5, in order to be eligible for
election to these offices.

Only one ballot can be cast for’

president and five can be cast for the
other remaining eight board
appointments. The board then
takes office the first day of classes of
the winter term.

All student government elections ,

are supervised by an elections com-
mittee appointed by student
government.

By TIM DINGER

The Panther tennis team
redeemed itself for last week’s 8-1
loss to Indiana University of
Pennsylvania by defeating Robert
Morris College 7-2 on Thursday and
Carnegie-Mellon University 8-1
yesterday. The two wins even their
record at 3-3.

“I don’t want to single out any
players because it was a fine team
effort,” tennis coach George

gapieffenbach said. “Our goal before

the match was to even up our record
at 3-3, and our team accomplished
its purpose. we really picked
ourselves up.”

After Pitt’s loss to YUP,
Dieffenback did not plan on letting
it happen again. He ran his players
hard the next day and worked on
their weaknesses.

“We’ve become smarter and
sturdier because of that,” he said.
“Now, this match was a great one to
build our confidence for the West
Virginia iinatch on Thursday.

have the same talent as we did last
year, and so do they. It was a case of
our wanting the match more than
they did."

Sophomore James McDonald (5-
1) got the Panthers started on the
right foot at the No. 1 position by
downing CMU’s Wayne Cutler 6-1,
6-4. Teammate DTJ. Mariano, Pitt’s
No. 2 Player, believes McDonald’s
playing has been a real inspiration to
the team and a real contributor to
the win.

Barry ooidbéiiig (ism

“He plays with a great deal of
intensity," he said. “He’s playing
world-class tennis right now.”

Mariano deserves some praise
himself as he evened up his season's
record at 3-3 by stomping CMU’s
Pete Weber 7-6, 6-0. In the first set,
Mariano won the tie-breaker" 7-4
before blanking the Tartan in the
second. V

Assistant coach _Jan Schnitzer
believes the loss to IUP has sparked
Mariano’s performance for the
better, saying, “He’s been-playing

Z extremely well after that match.”

At the ‘No. 3 spot, Panther Larry
Lederer (2-4) had an easy time with
CMU’s Steve Maybeck 6-3, 6-2.

“I played better than I thought I
would, but more importantly, the
team played better, and we’re
winning,” Lederer said. “I knew the
rest of the team was winning, and
that helped to motivate me.”

At the No. 4 spot, Pitt gave up its
only loss of the afternooon as
CMU’s Ed Martin dropped Panther
Jack Warwick (2-4) 6-3,6-2.

Pitt’s Dave Kortyna evened up his
record at 3-3 in the No.5 position by
squeaking past Tom Karitz 6-4, 7-5.

Closing out the singles matches,‘

Panther Jay Petras (2-4) chewed up
Tartan Greg Orsag 6-3, 6-0 to give
Pitt a 5-1 lead’ going into the doubles.

McDonald and Mariano started
the 3-0 Panther sweep of the doubles
by beating Cutler and Maybeck 6-2,
7-5.

By this time, the game reaches its '

By MARK A. SINDLER

It’s getting to be a devastating,
recurring nightmare around these
parts, and it couldn’t_ happen at a
more inopportune time or to a
more undeserving team.

The Panther volleyball squad is
playing its power game with the
power teams this season, but that
may be a bit misleading. In fact, the
record will prove it.

Here’s, the updated scenario.
Some of it may be atypical, some
not, but it's real-life dream with
which Pitt certainly doesn't want
any involvement.

Pitt readies the fortifications
against the Top 10 teams. Penn

State, George Mason, Ohio State, ,

Ball State have made some guest
appearances. For Pitt, though,
maybe too many. Anyway, the
Panthers usually begin their
matches against these foes and stick
to a script that calls for tight, close
games. _
\ No matter that the opposing
team is nationally ranked or that
the other side of the net boasts sev-
eral proven All-Americas. So, the
games see the typical “give-and-
take" approach being utilized by
Pitt. . _
The Panthers will relinquish
some points, whether by miscalu-
lation or error reasons, but will
sooner or later get several other

N'n"iv..m.t.r.o.l’:u..I r

I poinetsfbaclfﬂﬂmtglf s'c~'i1tp'pl7‘.13l-a-ye« o.......

   

closing act, and the curtain is about
to fall on one team or the other.
Again, the script calls for the
same—a frightening torrent of
meteorites from the opposing side.

By now, with loss in hand, the
Panthers can only look forward to
the next chapter and perhaps a dif-
ferent script.

Pitt did not stray from its typical
script this weekend when the team
traveled to Muncie, Ind., for the
Ball State Classic. Most of the
games played were close; the
Panthers saw themselves fit to play
side-by-side with the Top 10 pow-
ers that were also invited.

However, and this cannot be suf-

..ficiently overemphasized, post-

season play is rapidly approach-
ing—probably too soon for the
Panthers. Eastern Collegiate Vol-
leyball League playoffs begin next
weekend, and one of Pitt's likely
opponents will be Penn State.
The Nittany Lions have been a
source of tragic relief for Coach
Ray Reilly so far, and he still has
another matchup with them this
Tuesday before the playoffs start.
Friday night, Penn State served
Panther for dinner 15-1 I, 15-17, 15-

_ I2, I5-I0. The match marked the

fourth time this season the Panth-
ers have not mustered a victory over
their cross-state rivals.

/

osition

State defeated Pitt in another best-
of-five contest, but with not too

much room to spare 16-14, 15-13,-

l5-l0. Later that day, yet one more
match remained with Ohio State.
But when the Buckeyes were fin-
ished, only the remains of Pitt were
evident in OSU’s tracks. Final
scores: 2-15, 3-15, 10-15.

Despite his team’s finishing in
the pre-determined fourth position
in the tourney and despite a dismal
weekend showing, Reilly said his
players "played extremely well.”

He continued, “Our guys put in
a lot of hustle in the tournament
and played some great defense. We
played right with them; there was a
lot of hustle.”

Undoubtedly that has not been a
sore spot for the Panthers this year,
for the potential to go out on the
court and play competitively is
obvious. It is, though, the glaring
fact that six freshmen dominate
Reilly's 10-man squad and that the
four remaining upperclassmen are
continually called upon to start
game after game. '

That may be fine except that in
the critical game situations in
which the Panthers find them-
selves in each time, the squad-

more often than not-—cannot wrap ‘

up the win.

“All the games came down to the‘
last few points.” he said. “It has‘as
been a problem, but a problem

Panther Arms Ready To ‘K’ T artans

By scorr DELLETT

If the weatherman cooperates, the
Pitt baseball team . will face
Carnegie-Mellon in a double-header
tomorrow at l p.m. at Trees Field.
The Panthers have not seen action
since returning from Florida over a
week ago as the weather has been
typical for early spring—cool and
wet.

“We' need a dry day tomorrow
[today] in order to play,” head coach
Bobby Lewis said. “The field is still
damp.”

Due to the conditions, practice
has been relegated to the indoors,
but Lewis believes that not
practicing outdoors will not have an
effect on the whole team.‘

“Once we started, it may affect
individuals but not the team in
general," he said. “This problem is
not unique to Pitt; it's a problem for
the entire Northeast.”

But starting with a team like the
Tartans should help Pitt. Although
both schools neighbor each other,
there‘s -little doubt that Carnegie-

Mellon is a class or two below the
Panthers. However, that doesn't

‘ mean a sure two games added to the

win column.

“Carnegie-Mellon has played us
close in past years, though
sometimes we have been able to have
big margins against them,” Lewis
said. “They have had several players
who could have played at Pitt.”

Lewis will start two freshmen
tomorrow—Frank Craska and
Keith Shuster—but that isn’t a sign
of overconfidence.

“It's not dropping down in caliber
by pitching them, but I like to get
them into the starting rotation,” he
said. “I’d rather have the freshmen
pitch against CMU instead of West
Virginia, where I «could use the
veterans.”

One aspect makes the Panthers
pitching staff different from most—
left-handed pitchers. While having
southpaws is a priority in the major
leagues, Lewis doesn‘t see much
difference.

“Having a number of left-handers
is not important at this level,” he
said. Usually, you put the best
pitcher you have and let him throw.

“In the pros, pitchers know the
hitters well, and they have a book on
them through years of experience. In
college, you don't have that luxury.”

Although Lewis has a number of
left-handed pitchers, he would

prefer to have a balance of both
righties and lefties.

“It seems it goes in cycles,” he
said. “Five years ago, we only had
one left-handed while last year we
had six.

“We may have been overstaffed
with left-handers last year. I would
like to have more of a balance in a
pitching staff.”

Pitt will probably go with the
same starting lineup that would have
played in the Mar. 31 rained-out

game. Tony LaCava, Mike Miller,;;-

Paul Westwood and Tom Horew in
the inﬁeld; Doug Steiner, Dennis
Stitch and Darrell Gissendanner in
the outﬁeld and Tim Schwadron
catching. Replacements will depend
on the way the games are going.

There may be some concern with
some members of the pitching staff.
Jim Cosgrove has been suffering
tendonitis since returing from
Florida while left-hander Marty
Garda may be suffering an arm
injury similar to what Aaron Krause
had last year.

“We won't know how Jim is until
he throws the next couple days,"
Lewis said. “Marty may have some
scar tissue in his elbow, and he;
might be lost for the season.”

For now, injuries are not the main
concern for Pitt; getting a couple
games in is.

foreign Runners Outstepping Americans

By CHARLIE O’HARA

For any American collegiate
track and field athlete, it must be
quite difficult to accept the fact
that his sport has become increas-
ingly foreign-dominated.

Just ask Pitt junior Todd Colas,
who ran the fastest American colle-
giate.time in the 1,000-meter run
and didn’t even have the opportu-
mty to compete in the NCAA

ampionship race because of the
overabundance of foreigners in the’
event—-18 of the 23 NCAA qualifi-
ers were foreign-born.

The numbers are staggering; the
University of Texas at El Paso
(UTEP) is the most obvious exam-
ple of the influx} At the 1982
Indoor National Champioinships,

which UTEP captured for the
fourth consecutive year,.65 of the
team’s 67 points were scored by‘ for-
eign atheltes. ,

From an individual standpoint,
UTEP's Suleiman Nyambui is the
stereotypical athlete that is\enter-
ing the NCAA today. In his four-
year career at UTEP, Nyambui, a
native of Tanzania, captured an
unprecedented 15 NCAA titles. He
was undefeated throughout ‘his
four years of outdoor track and
became only the second NCAA
competitor to capture four titles in
the same event—tlie 10,000-rrieter
run.

The late Steve, Prefontaine, a
United States native, was the only
forerunner of Nyambui; he won
consecutive titles in the 5,000-
meter run.

Panthers Competitive

,At Colonial

By CHARLIE O’HARA

The Panther track team entered
this past Saturday’s outdoor season
opener, the Colonial Relays in
Williamsburg, Va., with the inten-
tion of getting experience; they
weren't concerned with times,
rather, they wanted to be
competitive.

But several Panthers not only ‘

finished respectably but also had
some excellent times.
The All America 3,200-meter

ieam of Bill Moorhead, Terry Gal-

gher, Garland Brown and Darren
Geary breezed to an eight-second
victory over host team William and
Mary, running the distance in 7:25.

The distance medley team of
Gallagher, Brian Pollock, Todd
Colas and Moorhead also won
impressively.

"The two-mile (3,200-meter)
relay team and the distance medley
team established themselves as
championship caliber teams,”
Panther coach John Vasvary said.
“They both ran very well.”

The sprint medley team of Rich
Baderinwa, Pollock, Mario Joyner
and Geary placed sixth (3:30.5) de-
spite running what Vasvary called

‘an awful race.
Individually, several Panthers

also ran well. In the “Feature
1500," Colas finished with the fast-
est collegiate time (3:48.6) in the
race while placing fourth overall.
Colas’ time qualifies him for the
lC4A Championships and estab-
lishes a new school record.

“Todd is showing that he can
run with just about anybody in the
East," Vasvary said. ‘‘I’m not say-
ing that he is unbeatable, but I am
saying that he will be very tough to
beat.”

In collegiate 100-meter dash,
Rick Asberry placed third with a
career best time of 10.6, which
qualifies him for the IC4A meet.

Relays

intermediate hurdles, but because
they were the slower heat and pla-
ces were determined by times, they
finished seventh and eighth over-
all. Joyner’s time qualifies him for
the IC4A meet.

“The intermediate hurdlers
established that they will both be
very good this season,” Vasvary
said. “Though they weren't flaw-
less, they showed us a great deal in
the opening meet.”

Another noteworthy Panther is
Darryl Shepherd. Though he
didn't place in the high hurdles, he
ran with a respectable time of 14.2,
which qualifies him for the IC4A
championships.

“Overall, we found a lot of good
things,” Vasvary said. “Asberry ran
his best time ever in the 100, with-
out the help of starting blocks. Bill
Moorhead ran two excellent races
on the relay teams. Garland, run-
ning alone, turned in a super time.
Ralph Mitton also performed well
in the triple jump, and he looks
good when you start thinking
about the conference meet.” I

This weekend the Panthers
travel to Knoxville, Tenn., for one
of the more prestigious meets on
the outdoor schedule, the Dog-
wood Relays.

The list of names, times and
numbers of championships and
titles that the foreign athletes have
compiled goes on and on, but there
is an underlying controversy over
which many of coaches across the
country are upset.

There is a clause in the NCAA
rule book that states if an athlete is
enlisted in the military, he doesn't
have to forfeit his athletic eligibil-
ity. Thus, athletes, such as Nyam-

V bui, who graduated at the age of 29,

or Julius Ogaro, a Kenyan native
formerly of Clemson who com-
pleted his four years at the age of
33, are able to compete without vio-
lating the NCAA rules. The most
recent addition to the long list of
world-class foreigners is former
world-record holder Filbert Bayi,

who at the meager age of 29, signed
a letter of intent last spring with
Oklahoma University. Bayi had
been a member of the Tanzanian
army for the past 10 years, while
competing internationally.

Many of our nation’s optimists
will argue that the foreign» athletes
promote competition for Ameri-
cans; but the level of competition is
now far above the 18-year-olds who
enter as freshmen. An American
high school senior who wins his
800-meter state title impressively in
1:50 won’t even draw the attention
of a UTEP or a Richmond Univer-
sity scout. Instead, they will go for
the internationally experienced
Bayi who runs the 800-meter run in
1:45 on an off-day.

Something must be done; too

. many of America’s athletes are
being deprived of the experience
that is needed to compete on any

international level. How can the
Americans compete internation-
ally if they can't even win their own_
national championships?

The standards for NCAA quali-
fication will soon be-tougher than
those of the Olympic trials.

“The NCAA championships
should be retitled. The ‘Junior
World Cup’ would be . more
appropriate,” Pitt coach John Vas-
vary said with a touch of sarcasm.

. The foreign influx has become
quite apparent to Pitt in its first

season of competition in the Big
East conference. The cross. country

Except for the fact that he might ,

be experiencing rookie pains,
Rutgers coach Eric Pavels antici-
pates a carbon-copy’match Satur-
day night.

“Again, I’m a first-year coach,
and I inherited a program for
which no recruiting was done, so
it's a building year,” Pavels said.
“We’ll probably again go five
games, I presume. We should be
stronger than we were before
because, again, we had just lost
eligibility to that player.”

“That player" has been a source
of controversy for Pavels’ this sea-
son. Yves Pierre is his name, and he
came to Rutgers with 20 credits
from another school. His eligibil-
ity has been questioned for Rutgers
since those credits are from evening
courses.

Pavels is still awaiting a decision
by the NCAA on the hitter-setter’s
status, but anticipates that every
game in which Pierre has played
will be forfeited.

The Panthers should be blessed
with such personnel problems.-. As

it is, the talent they have now just
doesn’t cut the mustard when it
comes to deciding a win or a loss.

CAME SERVES: After the three
consecutive losses at Ball State, the
Panthers’ seasonal match record
fell to 17-13-l.....Rugers will come
to Pitt with a 13-3-9 mark....Ac-
cording to Pavels, “Everybody (on
his team) is injured one way or
another; tendonitis, shoulder prob-
lems or back problems—-
everybody,” he said. “We’re just
together
though...." ' ~

always had a constant supply of
foreigners. World indoor mile-
record holder Eamonn Coghlan
ran under Jumbo Elliot, as did Sid-
ney Maree, the winner of the Fifth
Avenue Mile a year ago, to go with
the many impressive victories that
he achieved while wearing the Vil-
lanova blue and whites. W
Another recent development in
NCAA sports has been the arrival
of foreign athletes on the basket-
ball court, for example, Akeem
“The Dream” Olajuwon, the Ni-
gerian native whose dominating
style of play led the Houston Cou-
gars to the‘NCAA championship
game. Closer to home, Leo Rautins
(Syracuse), Bill Wennington (St.
John's), and Martin Clark (Boston
College) have all aided their respec-
tive teams throughout this past sea-
son. Is foreign domination in
American collegiate basketball to
come next? Come on NCAA, how
about a little compassion for tbf .

not be as well known as,Bill Fralic

important to the Lady Panther
track team as Fralic and Vaughan
are to their respective squads. The
reason that Henderson is an

lack of interest.

longer distances can be run on

nerves. To win in the sprints,
nerves must be honed. The differ-

times are measured in fractions of

Some Italian restaurants, deep down,
are as Italian as apple pie.

Napoli Pizzeria in Oakland is true green,
white and red - the colors of the Italian flag
- from wall panels to the globes on the light
ﬁxtures to the mesh pans on the wall that
illustrate the sizes of pizza.

The travel posters extol the Calabria
region outside Naples. Behind the counter
hangs a poster of the 1982 World Cup
championship soccer team. A stack of fly-
ers advertises a bake sale by the Pitt Italian
Club. And presiding over it all is Napoli‘s
trademark, the statue of the rotund chef
with a mustache, pizza pan outstretched to
advertise “the real Italian touch.”

Napoli‘s tomato sauce had a low quo-
tient of common Italian spices, but few

restaurants go to such lengths to advertise (

their Italian roots.

And no one serves bigger pizza cuts. I
ordered my customary half-hoagie and
two cuts of pizza, but had to leave part of it
behind.

The pizza cuts are 75 cents each, a price
that should have tipped me to their size:
roughly eight inches wide, 10 or 12 inches
long and about 3/4-inch thick. The doughy
consistency and the cheesy flavor are dif-
ferent from most Pittsburgh pizzas - and I
can‘t quite pinpoint what makes Napoli‘s

AD’s On Way Out...-.

Hot off of winning the 1983
NCAA Division I basketball cham-
pionship, NC State is looking for a
new athletic director. According to
the Greensboro Daily News, there
is a quiet search being conducted
for a replacement for Willis Casey.
Casey denies rumors of imminent
retirement.

AD’s On Way In....

Temple named Earl Cleghan
and Dr. Alpha Alexander as asso-
ciate athletic directors yesterday.
Athletic director Gavin White said
Cleghan will be in charge of men’s
athletics and that Alexander will
head up women's.

Cleghan was administrative
assistant to White before his latest
appointment; Alexander was act-
ing associate athletic director for
women.

Penn State On

Back....

Way

Coming off its first-ever cham-
pionship year, the Penn State foot-
ball squad looks to rebuild its
offense as it opened spring practice
yesterday in University Park. Head
coach Joe Paterno said that drills
will emphasize an offense that lost

, seven starters from an 11-1 team;

the Nittany Lionsfhave 35 letter-
men returning from last season's
national championship team.

 

The Pitt News, Wednesday April 6, 1983

Kansas bound?...

West Virginia basketball coach
Gale Catlett usually makes a lot of
noise, particularly when Pitt is
involved. Now, rumors have it that
Catlett will be the new coach at
Kansas.

Kansas earlier fired Ted Owens
in a bit of housecleaning but says it
still hasn’t hired a coach and that
the university would accept appli-
cations through today.

West Virginia’s athletic director
Fred Schaus said Kansas has not as
yet given permission to talk with
Catlett.

If Catlett leaves for Kansas, he
will be reunited with Gene Budig,
the former West Virginia president
and present chancellor at Kansas.

Starting A New Way....

Iowa yesterday named George
Raveling, a native of Hoban
Heights, Pa., as its new basketball
coach. This season, 45-year-old
Raveling led Washington State to a
second place, 23-7 finish behind
champion UCLA in the PAC-10
conference. The Cougars were 14-4
in the PAC-10. An aide to Bobby
Knight's U.S. team in the 1979
Pan-American Games, Raveling
will also serve as an assistant to
Knight for the 1984 U.S. Olympic
basketball team.

Pitt Hires C oach....

The Pitt football team has hired
Kent Schoolfield as a tight end
coach. Schoolfield previously
coached at Temple, New Mexico
and Floria State as a wide receiver
coach. ’

Schoolfield will be the ninth
coach, as allowed by a new NCAA
rule, but until Aug. 1, Schoolfield
will be a non-recruiting, part-time
coach.

Starting Another New
Way....

Immediately after Raveling left
his position with Washington

State, former assistant coach Len
Stevens was named as his replace-
ment. Stevens, 40, just completed
his second year after previously
completing coaching duties at the
high school and small-college
levels.

After the quick announcement,
Stevens said, “This sort of hap-
pened so fast I haven't had a chance
to react. When you are working
with a guy like George, and all of a
sudden, you’re trying to replace
him, it puts a little pressure on you.
But you wouldn’t be in this busi-
ness if you didn’t look forward to
the pressure.”

Involved In The Wrong
Way....

Light heavyweight boxing
champion Michael Spinks was
fined 31,700 plus court costs in
Philadelphia yesterday on a charge
of possessing a revolver without a
license.

Spinks. 26, was stopped by

police last January and ci. (1 for a

traffic violation when the weapon
was found. Municipal Court jus-
tice Francis Cosgrove accepted
Spinks’ guilty plea after he agreed

to plead under a plea bargain. Pro- .
secutors recommended Spinks nt')(4'1'”;}a,"

be jailed .in return for the guilty
plea.

Last month, Spinks added the
World Boxing Council crown to
his World Boxing Association title
by defeating Dwight Braxton.
