Let The Debating Begin

By MARK A. SINDLER

Abuzz for 60 electric minutes,
none ofthe 60,283 fair-weather folks
in Pitt Stadium Saturday will argue
over one of the most exciting foot-
ball games this season, between Pitt
and Penn State. '

The debate should rage on,
though, over why two “separate"
clocks were used while the Nittany
Lions staged a frantic comeback in
the game’s final l:l5 to walk away
with a 24-24 whatever it’s called.

Some calling it an injustice, others
feeling as though they hadjust puck-
ered up for their sister. No matter
the attituoe, Pitt now enters its ninth
straight post-season bowl, never as
forlorn after each of the last eight
years as on Saturday.

With Penn State driving on its last
possession, the Nittany Lions
reached Pitt’s 40 and ran a play with
l9 seconds remaining. Officials blew
it dead before the snap, but the play
was run anyway, and six seconds
elapsed. Two plays, later, the clock
read :00 and mayhem erupted.

It was premature. The referee
keeping his own official time, the
scoreboard was never adjusted.
Both coaches were told of the
change. the players were not, and
PSU placekicker Nick Gancitano

entered for a 32-yard conversion.
The kick was good, a majority ofthe
fans’ moods far from that.

“l know what happened with the
clock. but I don’t want to talk about
it,“ Pitt head coach Foge Fazio said.
“I was very disturbed about it. but
it‘s over. Technically. when [the ref]
blew the whistle. the clock should
have been stopped."

This debacle of sorts capped the
most productive day in the collegiate
lives of both quarterback John Con-
gemi and split end Bill Wallace.
Both connected for three touch-
downs, the final one lugging the
Panthers ahead 24-21 late in the
fourth.

Wallace finished with l0 recep-
tions for l73 yards; Congemi threw
for 284 yards on 2l of 29 attempts.
The tie singed Pitt's seniors moreso
than the team's two heroes.

“l’m disappointed with the tie,“
Fa/.io said. “The team is very disap-
pointed. A lot of emotion was let
loose, but l told them to hold their
heads up high. The seniors have had
a great four years, but they still have
one more game to play. They know
the Pitt football team is a great foot-
ball team." -

in their souls, the Panthers ada-
mantly point to a dominating game
they know spelled victory for them.
But people don’t look at statistics or

Bio-Technology Major
Receives Faculty Support

By JON WILLIAMS

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Council (FASC) Friday voted in
favor of the development of a bio-
logical technology major proposed
by the department of biological
sciences. _

“We have a golden opportunity to
take the lead in biotechnology.” Dr.
Albert Chung. chairman of the
department of biological sciences
said. “We can [excel] in the field of
biotechnology with the development
of a new undergraduate major.

“The shakeup in biological scien-
ces -is here to stay," Chung said.
“Normally-trained people in biolog-
ical sciences cannot handle this new
technology.“

Biotechnology is offered in many
universities, but only two of them

offer a program similiar to the pro-
posed major at Pitt. The difference
lies in the use ofa specialized depart-
ment called a “hypridoma facility,"
which would study hybrid cells
formed by the fusion oflymphocytes
and cancer cells.

The development of an under-
graduate major would draw atten-
tion to Pitt from industries that are
interested in pharmaceutical
research conducted by universities
and that need an increasing number
of personnel to operate their
companies.

Chung cited biotechnology as one
of the areas of great interest to
Pennsylvania.

“We have a chance to revitalize
Pennsylvania industry. Our univer-
sity can serve as a research center for
biotechnology," Chung said. “It can

“That’s the way the game went,
the way the cookie crumbles. what-
ever you want to say," said Pitt cen-
ter Jim Sweeney, a senior. “It hurts,
hurts a lot. I'll never understand
what happened at the end. I don’t
know how they did it, but they did."

Regardless of the games out-
come, Pitt knew its next destination
would be the Fiesta Bowl in a Jan. 2
post-season appearance against

Ohio State (losing to Michigan 24-
2I Saturday). Meantime, the Pan-
thers had other matters to settle after
being shortchanged 48-I4 and 19-l0
in the last two meetings with Penn
State.

It looked to be three straight years
when Penn State increased its l4-l0
half time advantage by seven when
linebacker Scott Radecic recovered
a Congemi fumble l:38 into the third
quarter. One play later, freshman
tailback D.J. Dozier rumbled in
from two yards out to stake the Nits
to a 21-10 lead.

the gap, getting three first downs
and l8 yards from tailback Joe

straight I00-yard performance with

Pitt medical students
expressed disappointment over
the progress and future of Pitt's
basic sciences Friday at a meet-
ing in which they jeered their
dean, Dr. Donald Leon, after he
declined to answer their
questions.

The students filled the auditor-
ium, hoping to hear assurances
from Leon that the progress
made in the basic sciences will
continue even if assistant dean of
academic affairs Dr. Robert E.
Olson elects to resign.

“The university has not
changed its direction or its com-
mitment [to the basic sciences],”
Leon said. “Those who doubt my
words can watch my actions.”

Leon later advised students
not to get involved in administra-
tive affairs and to “put the broo-
haha aside” and concentrate
their efforts on learning
medicine.

The students asked members
of the press and faculty to leave
so that they could continue their
discussion. During the meeting,
students discussed ways to put

Medical Students Question Future

their concerns on record. The
medical students said they are
not as interested in alleged per-
sonality conflicts between Leon
and Olson as they are in the con-
tinued quality of the basic
science departments, according
to medical student Gene
Brenowitz.

“There is a general anxiety
among students about the
increased costs [tuition], and our
only concern is tuition and the
quality of the basic science
departments," Brenowitz
explained. He added that these
departments are important in the
first years of medical school
because they acquaint the stu-
dents with the structure of the
human body.

Leon demanded Olson’s resig-
nation last week citing “aca-
demic incompatibility and a
difference in management philo-
sophy." Olson, however, has
contested this, saying the reason
behind the request was a ques-
tion of priorities. Olson has said
the administration is shifting
away from its commitment,to the
basic sciences. Olson also said
that income returned to the uni-
versity from Pitt faculty [physi-

cians or clinical assistants who
work with university facilities]
should be increased. .

A first-year medical student,
who asked not to be identified,
said students are upset because
they are not allowed any
feedback.

“We don’t want to do anything
irate," she said, “we are adults,
and we want to handle the situa-
tion like adults." She said the stu-
dents will deal with the matter
internally and that is one reason
why Friday’s meeting was closed
to press and faculty.

“It is difficult to figure out
where the clean is coming from,”
said another student who also
asked not to be identified
because he said he was concerned
for his career in medicine. He
said Olson was brought in to stop
the decline of quality in the basic
science program and what the
departments will look like if
Olson leaves is a major concern
among students.

“If the dean is being perfectly
honest, then why isn't there also
some sort of audit available to
students to see where money is
going?” he said. “Dean Leon
should be more visible.”

Students React To ‘The Day After’

“I know l will think about it a lot
more,” one Pitt freshman said. “You
just start thinking about your own
family and friends -- friends dying."

Paul Ochs was one of many stu-
dents who saw the ABC movie “The
Day After,“ a movie graphically
depicting the aftermath of a nuclear
war and what life would be for
survivors.

“It's hard to say what my reaction
is,“ he explained. “I mean, I used to
be pretty pro-nuclear.“ Ochs said he
saw the arms build-up as a sort of
necessary evil, but now he said he is
not sure. Ochs has finished his basic
training for the National Guard in

which he serves one weekend a
month.

The viewing on a large screen in
the William Pitt Union Kurtzman
Room was sponsored by the Pitt
Chaplains Association. The viewing
was disturbed by antennae trouble
causing many of the students to
leave and watch the movie
elsewhere.

Ochs said the movie showed him
what he did not want to see, the
savage state of society after a nuclear
war. .

“I knew they [survivors] would
become savage enough to kill over
food," he said.

Pitt senior Mick Young said the
movie horrified him, but he said it
also horrified him because the dam-
age in the movie was not as severe as
it could be.

“There is no way that radiation
sickness could be that painless,“
Young explained.

“It made me think about how nice
New Zealand is this time of year,” he
said.

The movie was disappointing for
Pitt freshman Martha Ellis.

“I think the movie made the whole
issue of nuclear war too melodra-
matic and didn’t treat the issue
seriously enough." Ellis said.

also serve our students in helping
them train for the newjobs. We need
to prepare our students in this area
of biotechnology to compete in get-
ting jobs."

Pitt reorganized its departments
of biochemistry, biology, biophysics
and microbiology under the depart-
ment of biological sciences in l976.
Combining these majors, formerly
all independent departments, has
enabled Pitt to offer the new major.

Chung said qualified professors
and the space needed to teach the
classes are already available at the

university. Space is available in
buildings currently used by the
department of biological sciences.

Chung said he expected 55 stu-
dents to enroll in the program
initially, with more students taking
the major as it develops.

Funding for renovations and the
purchasing of new equipment is still
an issue to be discussed by the coun-
cil. Chung has contacted sources to
help fund the new major, including
Pitt‘s medical school and the depart-
ment of health related sciences, and
expects financial help from private
centers.

Choral Group Offers Remembrance

By JIM SHAUGHNESSY

Nov. 22, 1963 —~ a date on
which occurred an event that
stopped America for four days.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the
charismatic 35th president of the
United States to whom many
looked for America’s future. was
mortally wounded by an assas-
sin’s bullet in Dallas. Texas.

Tomorrow, the University
Choral Society and the
University-Community Orches-
tra, under the direction of
Grover Wilkins III, will present a
concert commemorating the
20th anniversary of Kennedy‘s
death.

The program for the concert
will feature Mozart’s Vesperae

Solennes de Confessore, Francis
Poulenc’s Gloria and lgor Stra-
vinsky’s Elegy for JFK.

“The pieces had been chosen
for a concert before the signifi-
cance of the date was realized,"
Wilkins said. “It is interesting
that the first performance of the
Poulenc was the very day, Jan.
20, 1961, on which President
Kennedy was inaugurated and
that the performance was also in
Boston.

“The significance of the Elegy
is obvious."

The concert is the result of par-
ticipation by and cooperation
among a number of university
offices and departments, includ-
ing the music department, the
Chancellor‘s Office, the Office of

the University Secretary, News
and Publications, the Irish
Room Committee and the Gaelic
Arts Society. lt and Dr. Cyril
Wecht's lecture last week will be
the only official commemora-
tions of the Kennedy assassina-
tion by the university.

The concert, at 8:30 p.m. in the
Heinz Memorial Chapel, will be
an occasion for the university
community to come together and
remember the events ofthat day.

“We thought it appropriate
this day, during which many
Pittsburghers will stop to reflect
on this unusual American lead-
er’s life,” Wilkins said, “that we
open the doors ofthe Chapel and

offer to the community an
opportunity to share this
reflection.”

Pharmacy Student Made Delegate.

By DALE MOORE

A University of Pittsburgh
student has been elected to be the
regional delegate to the Ameri-
can Pharmaceutical Association
(APhA) convention, becoming
one of only eight such delegates
in the nation

Carole Schleicher, a fourth-
year pharmacy student, was
elected to be a regional delegate
to the Student American Phar-
maceutical Association
(SAPhA) at its annual conven-
tion held this year in Philadel-
phia. Along with the University
of Pittsburgh, Schleicher will
represent eight other schools
from five states and the District
of Columbia.

Schleicher said the main pur-
pose of SAPhA is to get students
involved in their future profes-
sion and hopefully keep them
involved after they graduate.

“ “Right now, the total APhA
membership is 50,000, and
12,000 of those are students,"
Schleicher said. “The APhA
keeps pharmacists informed
about new areas of treatment
and new laws and regulations

that affect the industry and tries
to help the pharmacist be the best
he can be."

As a regional delegate,
Schleicher, along with the seven
other delegates, will meet in Jan-
uary to word resolutions that will
be submitted at the national con-
vention in Montreal in May for
adoption. Some of the proposed
resolutions this year include
endorsement of guidelines for-
cing the implementation of per-
sonal drug profiles for each
consumer and support of legisla-
tion governing look—alike drugs.

After Schleicher and the other
delegates work out the wording,
the resolutions will be put before
the SAPhA House of Delegates
for approval or rejection. This
group is composed of one dele-
gate from each pharmacy school
in the U.S.

“After adoption by the
SAPhA House of Delegates, the
resolutions are pas§ed on to the
APhA council and may be incor-
porated into the APhA platform,
so student ideas have a chance of
becoming adopted by our profes-
sional organization,” Schleicher
said.

Ethical
Questions

Serious questions have been raised lately by the
government, the medical profession and the clergy
over what’s known as Baby Jane Doe cases.

There have been two Baby Jane Does in the news
this month; one in Indiana and one in New York. Both
babies had been born with severe handicaps and their
parents have refused to let doctors perform corrective
surgery and have withheld food from the children.

The Reagan Administration tried to interfere in the
parents’ decisions by demanding to see the patients’
medical records. The Supreme Court upheld the par-
ents’ rights in the Indiana case and two New York state
courts have ruled in the parents favor in Long Island.
Both cases are evidence that the government needs to
stay out of ethical and moral issues that face individual
citizens from time to time.

Although we are not going to make a statement on
whether the parents’ actions were right or wrong, we
applaud the courts decision upholding private rights
and letting individuals make their own decisions.

During President Reagan’s campaign for president
in I980, he pledged to get big government out of the
peoples’ private lives. Yet, time after time since he took
office, his administration has had its hands in more
citizens’ personal matters than many of his predeces-
sor’s.

The Justice Department's defeat in the Baby Jane
Doe case is a victory for the private citizen and allows
him to make the decision where moral and ethical
questions are concerned. Religion has tradionally
been the body to turn to whenever ethical matters were
concerned.

Cases such as Baby Jane Doe should be handled by
the medical community and the religious community.
Because of the recent events that have transpired,
hospitals need to take a long look at the issue and
decide how they would handle the situation if it ever
occurred in their hospital.

According to an article in Sunday’s Philadelphia
Inquirer, only one percent of the nation’s hospitals
have ethics committees that deal with difficult treat-
ment decisions, like the Baby Jane Doe case, and only
a few of those are currently active. Because hospitals
deal with life and death matters every day, that statistic
is somewhat alarming.

Hospitals nationwide need to establish and work
with such committees to keep the decisions on such
cases as these inside the private sphere of society
instead of involving the government.

_These ethics committees would be comprised of

doctors, a clergyman or woman, a parent of a handi-
capped child, a person that is involved in an organiza-
tion that serves the handicapped community in
addition to other advisers and counselors.

This way, both the parents would be involved as well
as the individual hospitals. Ethics committees would
then be responsible for whatever decision it would
make and would keep the government out of the pri-
vate lives of its citizens.

Childhood Memories or JFK

By MIKE BUCSKO

I vaguely remember what hap-
pened that day. I do recall my
teacher, Mrs. Ravella, coming into
the room crying, then telling us the
president was dead.

How much time passed before I
ran the three blocks to my house, I
can't recall. I seem to remember that
the day was overcast and rainy, but
maybe that‘s just the way I felt
inside. When I walked in my house,
it was hauntingly quiet. My parents
were in the kitchen — I guess they’d
just come home —- and the TV was
off.

My parents noticed by the look on
my face that something was wrong;
they probably thought I’d been sent
home from school for misbehaving.
When I told them what my teacher
had told me, they didn‘t believe it.
Because I was only six years old and
prone to. exaggeration, I can’t say
now that I blame them.

So it was up to Uncle Walter to
verify the information via the “real”
truth of TV. I remember Cronkite,
in his fatherly way, saying some-
thing about Dallas and Abby Hen-
son and a suspect. My parents sat in
front of the tube, trying to find out
what happened while they were out

, shopping.

I remember visiting my aunt in
Washington, D.C., sometime
shortly after the assassination and
stopping at his grave in Arlington. It
was only a small mound then, with
caps from the Army, Navy, Marines
and Coast Guard surrounding an

eternal ﬂame. This was enclosed by a
white picket fence, and I and other
visitors were led by the grave. Some-
how, I feel it was cold the day I went
to the cemetary, at least that's the
feeling the memory evokes in me
now.

Because I resemble my mother
more than my father, I guess I identi-
fied with her Irish-Catholie back-
ground more than my father’s
Slovak heritage. Somehow, my
mother made me aware that the
president wasjust like us, and I
remember feeling that I really knew
him. Over the next few years, I deve-
Ioped a fascination with him because
of this kinship I felt, like he was a
distant relative or an uncle I’d never
seen.

I don’t think it was any coinci-
dence when books about him
appeared around my house in the
next few years. The books I read and
looked at (there were a lot of pic-
tures)_ enchanted me. I remember
studying a picture of the president
sailing, and I recalled -how I cried
and laughed when I was at the
movie, “P.T. I09." We even had a
recording of the Jimmy Dean song
by the same name.

A few years later, when his
brother and Martin Luther King Jr.
were shot, I wondered what might
have been and why everything
seemed to be falling apart. That was
the year there was a big fight — I
called it a “riot" — between people
in my hometown and a visiting foot-
ball team from a predominantly

black town on the Monongahela. I'd
wanted his brother. to be president
because he reminded me of him.
Besides, he had long hair, and I was
just starting to grow mine then.

Now, I‘ve learned the president
wasn't all I thought he was. His for-
eign policy and defense build-up
remind me all too much of the cur-
rent administration. He supposedly
had Ted Sorenson ghost “Profiles In
Courage” for him. I’m told he
bought votes in the West Virginia
primary and that his reluctance to
act on civil rights legislation was a
political maneuver.

But even though I know this, I
can’t help feeling that there’s some-
thing missing from life in this coun-
try, something only he could have
given-us. Perhaps my memories are“
sugared with the naivete of youth, or

   

maybe my Irish-Catholic heritage is i‘

somehow blinding me from accept-
ing the “real” man, spotted record
and all. But I haven‘t felt the same
about any president since then, nor

am I likely to, considering the cur- '

rent PTOSPCCIS.

The glut of television programs
about him now are doing him more
harm than good, I'm afraid, because
I think people are going to be sick of
hearing of him; especially those born
after his death.

But for those people, I hope you
can discern for yourselves the type of
impact he really had on people like
me. He’s the only person whom I
never met but loved. And I don’t
even know why.

Philosophy Ignores Basic Right

Dear Editor:

The only thing the editorial
“Monopoly on Truth“ (The Pit!
News, Nov. 16) proved was that its
author subscribes to the “wealth is
evil“ philosophy and lacks concern
for the property rights of others.

The person who wrote the editori-
al seems ignorant of the fact that the
so—called “7—7-7" law is a violation of
the rights which our government
supposedly protects. Since when did
the government have the right to tell
either individuals or corporations
what they could or could not own‘?

In a free society. one may buy
whatever one can afford; the govern-
ment has no right to interfere unless
either buyer or seller resorts to coer-
cion. It makes no difference if it's a
radio station orjust a radio. Whena
government can deprive its citizens
of their rights at the whim of a
bureaucrat, the nation it governs is
no longer free.

The Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) was not

founded to protect the rights of sta-
tion owners but to allow the govern-
ment to meddle in their affairs on the
socialist pretext that “the public
owns the airwaves.“ If President
R3383" IS “my0pic." as the editorial
asserts, the proof lies not in his
relaxing a few Mickey Mouse regu-
lations but in his failure to abolish
the FCC altogether. (As a former
FM dlSI(j0CI(€y, I am all too familiar
with the tax-wasting, bureaucratic
mess that “Friendly Cousin Charlie"
generates “in the public interest.")

The editorial contains no evidence
for the argument “...most indepen-
dent broadcast stations would be
forced out of business through a loss
of advertising." Stations lose their
sponsors only when they either do
not sell their airtime at a reasonable
rate or do not carry the programs or
music that will attract a sufficiently
large audience.

As for corporations. the movie
industry and the editorial staffs
taste. Hollywood was turning out
“low quality” movies long before

Gulf-Western and v Coca-Cola

 

bought Paramount and Columbia.
The reason why they make these
movies is that most people like them.
(I’d hate to live in a world where only
a minority of the people would find
any of the media enjoyable.)

The privately-owned media did
not fabricate the Gulf of Tonkin
incident as the editorial suggested.
The credit for that goes to the liberal
Democratic government of Lyndon
Johnson. When the media found out
the government had lied, they
wasted no time telling the public.
The fact that they made a profit
doing so is no reason to brand them
Immoral; profits help keep people
employed.

Finally. consider this: if the
government had owned the media
during the early 1970s. we might
never have learned about Water-
gate. I can think of no better argu-
ment in favor of private ownership
of the media.

Finding Peace

The Pitt News. Monday‘. November 2|.

Clergyman Contiues Life’s Work

By MARTY WILLIS

Rev. Bob White. Pitt‘s campus
minister. is able to describe the
essence of his work in one sentence:
“As Jesus said. when you do it to the
least of my brethern — — whatever"it"
may be - you're doing it to me.
That‘s my theology."

White's work brings him into con-
tact with a diverse mix of students.
staff. and faculty. with a focus on
their spiritual. personal. and social
concerns. Through it all. issues of
peace and social justice occupy the
forefront of the Methodist clergy-
man’s work.

“I am egalitarian because I take
my Christian discipleship pretty
seriously. which calls me to witness
on behalf of all people based on the
proposition that the Christian mes-
sage is a revolutionary healing mes-
sage seeking wholeness in society‘.
The evangelical thrust of the mes-
sage is calling for peace andjustice in
society.“ White said.

White said that the political
stands he has taken throughout his
religious career. such as his vehe-
ment opposition to the nuclear arms
race. have been inspired by his vision
of a more egalitarian world.

This approach. however. has not
been without its costs. "People have
called me a lot of things. including
communist. though I’m not called
that very much. face to face.

“The most significant issue today.
in my opinion, is “Is the world going
to make it till tomorrow‘.”‘ White
said last week.

The threat of nuclear war is. how-
ever, only one aspect of a larger
problem. As White sees it. the bil-
lions of dollars spent on weapons
technology throughout the world
must be redirected toward the needs

of poor and hungry people if they .

are to have a decent life. For this

reason. he continually maintains
that “The Bomb has already
dropped."

"Its not only that I'm worrying
about the world ending tomorrow.
The world has already ended today
for Third W orld people. One of the
mayor reasons is that the bomb of
technology. the bomb of bad and
immoral politics. the bomb of
racism has already dropped on
them." he said.

White also sees a connection
between American foreign policies
and poverty in the Third World.
"We're spending all this money. all
this time. and all this energy while
the rest of the worlds going to hell in
a handbasket. We're trying to prop
up fascist regimes all over the world.

“What is ‘Freedom’ if you don't
have any self-determination‘? lt‘s
freedom for white. middle-class peo-
ple who have white. middle-class
opportunities. There's a w_hole
chunk of people out there for whom
the whole issue is trivial and irrele-
vant." he said.

While White readily acknowled-
ges that “not to see the political side
of me is not to see me."he is quick to
add that his primary orientation to
life will always be theological.
“When I meet people in prayer and
have counseling and sharing and
worship experiences. that's the big-
gest part of me and my ministry.“ he
said. ~

Lniversity of Pittsburgh. I feel that
ministry on the university campus
requires sensitivity. understanding.

also acts as campus minister for
Carnegie—Mellon Lniversity. Cha-
tham and Carlow Colleges. White
works through the Lnited Campus
.\1inistry. a chapter of the statewide
Lnited Ministries in Higher
Education.

Pitt graduate student I)an Shea
met White after attending a series of
Tuesday services in Heinz Chapel
last year. "His main attraction for
me was that he's an outstanding
speaker. He has the ability. in my
opinion. to take complex theologi-
cal ideas and make them under-
standable to a non-theologian."
Shea said.

Shea sait. that he was able to
develop a rewarding one-to-one
relationship with the minister des-
pite differences in political views.
“I'm not really a nuclear freeze per-
son. In fact. I might lean the other
way. But I have so much respect for
him...l can sit down and talk with
him and he's perceptive enough to
know" what it is that I'm dealing with
or where I am. He understands. And
the thing is 'hat he responds intelli-
gently’. notjust saying ‘I understand‘
in a nonchalant way. He’s there with
you.

‘It was A
Total Shock’

By MARK A. SINDLER

A fairly large diametrical logo of
the Fiesta Bowl committee ﬂanked
the 20 or so seniors and Pitt head
coach Foge Fazio as they stood
before the discerning glare of televi-
sion lights and an assembled entour-
age of media.

Tom Flynn. part of a two-man
wrecking crew in the defensive
secondary, held one arm around the
other part of that duo. Troy Hill. It
was not a fullyjoyous occasion. Hill
reached up and wiped a tear from
one of two glazed eyes.

The damn glare also noted a sort
of glaze in Fazio’s eyes. as yet
unknown whether that was due to a
slight cold earlier in the week or
Saturday’s outcome against Penn
State. Maybe it didn’t matter either
way.

Pitt‘s locker room was the site ofa
very somber group of players. The
zip could not be evidenced. Only an
official acceptance of the Fiesta
Bowl bid somehow turned that
around. ‘'

“On behalf of the Fiesta Bowl, I
want everyone to know we‘re cer-
tainly the best team in the east."

Fazio said. ‘‘I‘m glad that they have
so much confidence in us to invite
us. I want to apologize to them. I
know they wanted a nine-and—two
team in there."

Instead. Fiesta president Bruce
Skinner is going to have an 8-2-l
team in there against Ohio State (8-
3). A half an hour earlier. an even-
tual 24-2| victory over Penn State
would have ended a two-year losing
streak to the Nittany Lions"‘and
shoved the Panthers into a position
that likely would have left them in
contention for the nation's Top I0.

A “fluke" changed all that.

Nineteen seconds remaininginthe
game. an official’s whistle blew dead
a Penn State play from Pitt’s 40

before the snap. No one heard it. Six
seconds ticked off. Later. the refs
told both coaches. No one told the
scoreboard operator. No one told
the players or the fans.

No one told anybody of the possi-
bility that Penn State would have
one final shot at coming back from a
losing situation to a tie. And. no one
told the Panthers that they were
headed from a winning position to a
deadly tie.

More to the point. a state of
limbo. A vacuum.

“We were told late in the game
that everything wasn't right.“ Flynn
said. “but we were never told how
much time was actually left. lt was
something both benches should
have been aware of."

The way jubilant fans poured
onto the field faster than oil from a
quart can. a lot of pent-up emotions
could have been better spent“.

“The end of the game could have
been handled a lot better." Flynn
continued. "If you’re not going to
use the clock. then turn it offand get
the fans off the field. It was not
handled professionally. We were
never informed of the situation."

“I let loose all my emotions."
quarterback John Congemi said.
“Then after the kick. I had nothing
left. I was surprised they‘d go forthe
tie. really. l thought they‘d go for the
win.” L

Penn State head coach Joe
Paterno. grinning like a fox. right
before placekicker Nick Gancitano
placed his tee down. had some
“hard-felt sympathy“ for his boys.

“We were going to try a fake field
goal.” Paterno remarked. “but l felt
our seniors worked so hard. l
wanted them to leave with some-
thing. Pitt played a great game. and
you hate to take a team away from a
win. but I had to look at my own
situation. l can understand how the

PROVIDENCE, R.l. Slowly.
the soft murmurs surfaced above
the silence. the atmosphere was
heavy with the heat of battle-
weary bodies and bitterly-
contemplated thoughts largely
left unspoken. Those few words
were mere reflections ofthe deep
despair and shocked disbelief
wrought by the disintegration of
a dream.

As the van pulled away.
members of Pitt's women‘s vol-
leyball team did not look back at
Alumni Hall. home ofthe Provi-
dence Lady Friars. the l983 Big
East Conference champions.

Providence. which hosted the
tournament. had moments ear-
lier beaten down the charging
Lady Panthers and brought their
season to a crushing halt. The
tournament was to have been the
door’ to an invitation to the
NCAA national championships
for the pre-tournament favorite.
Pitt. but it was a door that
opened only to a select few.

Spikers Eliminated
From Postseason

The Friars defeated Pitts-
burgh l9-l7. 15-7 and l5-l0. but
according to Pitt coach Shelton
Collier. the host had some help.

“I have to give Providence a
lot of credit." Collier admitted.
“They played extremely well. but
on a neutral site. there is no way
they would have beaten us. What
l can say. at the risk of sour
grapes. is that in all my years as a
collegiate player and coach. l
have never seen an official have
such an effect on the outcome of
a match.

“I think it obviously stems
from the No. l-seeded Pitt tra-
velling to the northeast. which is
part of the competition." Collier
explained. “I am not one to com-
plain about one or two question-
able calls. but this official
consistently made questionable
calls."

in the first game. Pitt had
worked for a l4-9 lead but the
serves which have dominated
many opponents this season
backfired. Collier explained the
bad refereeing that led to a Prov-
idence victory.

drought continued until Congemi
closed a 69-yard drive with a 23-yard
scoring pass to Wallace. who would
have dropped it were he fingertip-
less.

“This was my finest day as a
player." said Wallace. in his first
year as a starter. “With Dwight[Col-
lins. flanker with sprained ankle]
down and hurting. they were calling
my number a lot more today. We felt
they played offa lot. so we wanted to
start the game with short stuff."

Except for an l8-yard completion

gemi didn‘t use anything fancy in
Pitt‘s first drive in the opening quar-
ter as Pitt rolled to an early 3-0 lead.
On Penn State‘s next possession.
though. quarterback Doug Strang
hit flanker Kenny Jackson on the
first of two touchdown passes when
the All-America wide receiver
wriggled through the coverage of
Pitt‘s Troy Hill and Melvin Dean
five minutes into the first quarter.

Pitt rebounded quickly. Congemi
flipping a l7-yard TD pass 30
seconds into the second quarter to
Wallace over the head of safety
Mike Zordich in an end Ionecorner.
The seesawing continued unabated
when Penn State then punted for the
second time. One drive later. Strang
read at Jackson adjustment to the
outside and fired a 57-yard TD
bomb that Hill totall_v misread.

Both teams headed for the locker
room eight minutes later. Penn State
ahead I4-l0. Except for the Strang-
Jackson hookups. Pitt‘s defense tied
and gagged Penn State’s offense. lts
running attack was held to minus-
six yards. Dozier. needing eight
yards to reach L000. had five carries
for a lonesome vard. ‘

Dozier did eventually get his
eight. running for l0 yards overall
on ll carries. though Penn State
only scraped up 35 rushing yards all
day. It was another good day for
Strang. who eclipsed Pitt’s secon-

dary for 246 yards on I4-of-23
attempts. The Nittany Lions’ total
offense (28|) croaked when com-
pared to Pitt's (469 yards).

“Offensively. we really controlled
them all over the field.“ fullback
Marc Bailey said. “Individuals and
the offensive line did a great job.
With three scores coming by the
pass. I‘m sure that if we had five
more minutes. we would have
scored.“

What if'.’ Though Pitt committed
only one fumble in the first half. the
team became bogged down in
miscues during the game's latter 30
minutes. On the dav. Congemi com-

mitted three fumbles. one recovered.
the other two by fullback Billy
Owens and McCall. recovered by
guard Mike Dahl.

Congemi also faced a surprisingly
strong and effective pass rush in the
second half. the Nittany Lions often
times coming with a blitz by hero
Harry Hamilton. Penn State also
sacked Congemi three times in the
first half, each time forcing Pitt to
punt.

The last one, right before the half.
never let Pitt try a 38-yard field goal
to come within a point.

“We made a few mistakes too
many times." Fazio said. “We were
trying to take ourselves out of bad
plays. As for at the end of the half.
we were trying to either throw into
the end zone or throw an incomple-
tion. But [Congemi] scrambled out
[of bounds]. He's a young QB. and
that happens."

"They were as much a part of this
victory as the current team." Pitt
head coach David Belowich said.
"The team did it for them.“

The freshman class was most
responsible for the victory. Led by
Susan Hickman's record-shattering
performance in the 50-yard free-
style. the Lady Panthers rolled. out
to an insurmountable 78-28 lead in
the first twelve events.

Hickman broke Kathy Stetler’s
mark of 23.89. set in I979. by cover-
ing the 50-yard distance in 23.4l.
The time also qualified the freshman
from Orlando. Fla.. for the NCAA
national meet.

Pitt kids feel. but I wanted our kids
to leave with something.”

Tackle Bill Fralic felt something.
too, upon being one of several to
first enter the locker room after the
scoreboard showed :00. He hadn‘t
made it to the door when Penn
State's field goal unit hit the field.

lt‘s going to take a while for that
bowl bid to sink in. You can more
easily go toa bowl than defeat Penn
State.

“It's great." he nonchalantly said
of the Fiesta. “I don‘t realize it now
because l‘m so depressed. but we’re
heading out there [Tempe. Ariz.]
soon. Anybody who saw that game
today knows who the better team
was.

“I've been here two years and have
lost against them two years in a row.
Then today...."

Exactly. To explain Saturday’s
game is like explaining the theory of
relativity to a Chilean shepherd.

“Its an experience you can't de-
scribe," Fralic concluded.

“I'm not disappointed." Flynn
said. “However a tie feels. that's how
I feel. l wanted to win. no question
about it. but I also didn't want to
lose."

He didn’t understand the context
of the situation at the time, but full-
back Marc Bailey does realize that
Pitt will fall short of credit deserved
because of what people consider an
accurate indicator of teams’
strengths.

lnjustices can just as easily be
served a team as converting a very
potential win into what folks call a
compromise.

“It was a total shock," Bailey said,
“when the guy came onto the field

for the field goal. l feel deep down,

deep down. that we won the game
between the lines. It's a shame and
unfortunate because this is a task we
worked so hard for."

Paterno seemed only slightly
phased by it all, as if no fuss were
necessary.

“It would have been more fitting if
we had won," he said. “You're satis-
fied with a tie. l felt forthe kids from
Pittsburgh, who helped keep this
football team together, and wanted
them to come away with something.
I felt we played well."

Penn State contemplated the fake
field goal, but that was nixed when
Fazio called a timeout. Paterno
opted for the next alternative.

“I didn’t know we were going to
go for the fake field goal," Ganci—
tano said. “ln a way, l’m glad Coach
Paterno decided to go for the field
goal. On the other hand, it would
have been nice to beat them."

On the other hand, Pitt doesn’t
need anyone for consolation. The
Panthers already understand this
year’s Pitt-Penn State winner. The
score, here, is immaterial.

Said defensive end A] Wengli—
kowski after Fazio officially
accepted the Fiesta invitation:
“They can’t take that away from us.”

“[The official] even went so far
as to threaten a penalty point
against my players for their nor-
mal expressive cheering," he
said. “This is highly uncommon,
as is awarding Providence a criti-
cal technical at 15-15 on us for
simply questioning a call. This is
simply not done by an ofﬁciai
anywhere, particularly in a game
such as this."

The Friars led, as a direct
result of the call, I6-I5 and went
on to win that critical first game.

The match was not out of
reach for Pitt, but in the second

/.

game, the dream took on a night-
marish quality as Pitt failed to
take the lead. Again the host pre-
vailed I5-7.

Then came round three, and
the possibility of the NCAA
invite grew ever more dim as
Pitt’s confidence slipped away,
hastened by a vociferous Provi-
dence crowd and New England
officiating. The visitors again
failed to take the lead, stymied by
sturdy Friar blocking and con-
sistent digs of Pitt spikes.

Providence took the game IS-
l0, the match 3-0 and the coveted
Big East crown and the bid to

Spikers Aced In Big East

represent the conference at the
national tournament that went
with them.

Pitt dominated the tourna-
ment for the first four games,
defeating Boston College. I5-I2
and 15-3; Seton Hall, I5-2 and
l5—3; Villanova, I5-I0 and 15-8;
and Syracuse in the semi-finals,
l5-0, I5-5, I5-8.

The Lady Panthers won nine
straight games before losing to
No. 2-seeded Providence, who
had won nine of 12 before defeat-
ing Pitt. Pitt ends the season with
3| wins and II losses — and a
dream unfulfilled.

O‘Ne‘~l and Nordine Burrell missed
the national cutoff time by two—one
hundredths of a second. Pfister,
Hickman, Stacy Moller and O’Neil
each won two events, while Pitt also
took the first two places in seven
events.

There was not one bad swim
tonight," Belowich said. “This was
the best team effort since l‘ve been at
Pitt."

It is the best freshman class since I
have been here," Belowich said.
“Besides Susan, a couple other
swimmers are close to national
cuts."

The Lady Panthers won I2 of I4
swimming events, offsetting the
dominance of the Michigan divers,

who swept all three places in both
the one- and three-meter events,
gaining a 16:2 margin in the process.

Even though the divers did not
earn a place in the top three posi-
tions, Pitt diving coach Julian Krug
believes this meet will benefit the
team in the long run.

“One thing they learned was
Michigan was better than we are,
but not as much as we thought," he
said. “We are doing the same diffi-
culties in dives as they are. the differ-
ence being they have been doing
these ‘dives for years.

"I'm not disappointed on how we
dov'.'. We are a young and inexpe-
rienced team developing on sch:
ule. This meet fits into the schedule."
