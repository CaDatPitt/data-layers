Humphrey Blasts Domestic
Critics of Vietnamese Policy

Veep Lauds
‘American

Way of Life’

By FRED N. FRANK

“We will not withdraw.
We wﬂl use our power with
restraint and work for the
freedom of others,” was
Vice-President Hubert Hum-
phrey’s reply to a student’s
question about United States
involvement in Vietnam.

The Vice-President was in
Pittsburgh Thursday pri-
marily to speak at the Demo-
cratic Fund affair, the Jef-
ferson Day Dinner. He spoke in
Stephen Foster Memorial in the
afternoon, as part of the Midday
Series.

In a discussion period after the
speech, a student had two ques-
tions about Vietnam. First, if
the Vietnamese wanted to be un-
der the control of the Commun-
ist Viet-Minh did the U.S. have
the right to stop them? Second,
how can Humphrey reconcile his
liberal feelings with U.s. policy
in Vietnam when he knew about
some of the United State’s “bar-

‘ baric” tactics?

Vice-President Humphrey’s im-
mediate reply was “I’m glad you
asked that question, son, because

as he _addresses the

, J K” _ P ‘ a Memorial
I’m really going to give it to
you.»

Humphrey blasted the student,
“Your enemy is in Peking, not in
Washington. Don’t talk to me
about the terrorism of the United
States. Peking has declared that
it intends to cut the ﬁngers off
of -Vietnam.”

Bio Professors

Receives NSF

Research Grant

Dr. Donald M. Green, as-
sociate professor of biology,
has received a $138,500
grant from the National Sci-
ence Foundation to study
genetic material.

The purpose of the three-year

grant will be to correlate, by

physical shearing of the genetic
material DNA, the physical dis-
tances of genes and genetic map-
ping distances.

The technique will shear DNA
from the bacteriaphage bacillus
subtillis into different size pieces
and analyze their genetic ca-
pacity. U

Carol Chiliora, graduate re-
search assistant in biology, will
work with Dr. Green on the mole-
cular genetics project. The in-
vestigation enables scientists to
make reasonable estimates about
sizes and interactions of genes in

developing genetic milieu for.

To Study Effects
Of Light Energy

Dr. Jerome Rosenberg,
professor of chemistry has
been awarded a $27,000
grant by the National Sci-
ence Foundation for research
on the “Chemistry of Elec-
tronicly Excited Aromatic Sub-
stances.”

Related to photochemistry or
the science of the reaction of a
substance to the absorbtion of

' light, Dr. Rosenberg’s research is
involved with the increased ac-
tivity of molecules after the ab-
sorption of light. It is known
that light as a form of energy
causes a redistribution of elec-
trons in molecules.

Dr. Rosenberg will attempt to
trace the details of this redis-
tribution. He, hopes, as a bonus,
to learn more about the arrange-
ment of electrons in complicated
molecules.

Dr. Rosenberg has ‘been at the

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Scholarship

Program  
Favored

By DONALD FRIEDMAN

Representative Max H.
Homer, testifying in City
Council chambers, Friday,
proposed a wide-‘base state
scholarship program as the
most favorable solution to
the problem of supplying low-
cost higher education in Western
Pennsylvania.

Rep. Homer is co-sponsor and
the primary author of the House
resolution which called for the
establishment of a state commis-
sion to explore the possibility of
this University becoming a state

. university on the undergraduate

level.

When questioned after his tes-
timony before the special state
sub-committee to investigate the
possible establishment of a; state
university in Western Pennsyl-
vania, he denied that he had
changed his position and added
-that he was still interested in
“the examination of state status»
for Pitt.”

Rep. Homer felt that a schol-
arship program would be more
advantageous than either build-
ing a new state university or
converting an existing school. He
attacked the ﬁrst possibility of
the impracticality of starting a
new university from scratch.

Although Rep. Homer found the
second alternative more practi-
cal, he felt that it was not the

“best” or “total” solution. Its
disadvantages are possible en-
rollment losses in the other col-
leges and universities in the area
and a drop in private endow-
ment funds for the school in-
volved.

With. a scholarship program,
the state would only pay for
those students who could not af-
ford at college education.

Proposals

need for continued and in-
creased quality at the Uni-
versity and proposed four

ing of such quality.whi1e speak-
ing' before the subcommittee to
.investigate the establishment of
a state university in Western
Pennsylvania in City Council
chambers, Friday.

the University took “no position ’
at this time,” but that he was .
presenting the same alternatives
which are facing the University's
study committee on the Universi-
ty’s status as well as the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania.
First, the University could “be-
come an entirely private institu-
tion, supporting its program en-
tirely from private funds,” he
explained. I J
The Chancellor felt. that this
would force the University_to“7

professional education,” as pre-
sent private endowments are not
enough to sustain the University
even when supplemented by state

out would force the state to build
a new state university.

Keeping the University in its
present status of a “state-aided”
institution would necessitate
“some material alteration in the
relationship” between the Univer-
sity and the state, commented
Chancellor Litchﬁeld.

He deplored the fact that pres-

er made in relation to the cost
of programs being offered.

discuss “The Imperative of a
Reconciled Society,” Wednesday
at noon in the Student Union
Lower Lounge as part of the
Student Union Board Midday

Boyte was invited by Dr. King
to join the staff of the SCLC in
July of 1963 and was recently
requested to launch a new pro-
gram of reconciliation for the
organization, which will be known
as Operation Dialogue.

teers in Service to America
(VISTA) as examples where
youth had volunteered to work
for the Great Society.

The Vice-President closed his
speech by asking the youth in
the audience to “have no little
plans .and no little dreams. Work
to do the impossible. Ask your-
self ‘How can I do something
for my generation?’ Don't just
study history. Make it. I give
you a noble challenge, but I

Committee UrgesiState

Formation of Board

Of ‘Higher Education

Dr. Earl J. McGrath, former United States commis-
sioner of education, has submitted the results ofthe study
on state colleges, which his committee made last November,
to the State Board of Education for study.

The McGrath Committee urged the creation of a State
of Higher Education to oversee the expansion and admin-
istration of the 14 Pennsylvania state colleges.

At the same time the board
approved and forwarded to the
State Planning Commission a
construction program including
$17,213,700 for the University.
The appropriation includes $13,-
853,200 for dorms; $2,610,000 for
married students quarters; and
$750,000 for professional build-
ings. .

The McGrath Committee pre-
sented the following recommen-
dations to the Board:

> Establishing a separate nine
member Board of Higher Educa-
tion to supervise planning and
development, of the state col-
leges.

> Create a secretariat to co-

Lambda feels that their new-
est project directed overseas is
their way of recognizing the as-
sistance needed by many chil-

The purpose of Delta Sigma
Pi, founded in 1907, is to pro-
mote “scholarship, social aware-

- ness, and the closer affiliation

between the commercial world
and students of commerce,”'stated
Walsh.

In addition, it tries to further
“higher standards of commercial
ethics and culture and the civic
and commercial welfare of the
community.”

Manufacturers are apt to

We'd like to boast a bit
about the guarantees in life

the only ﬁnancial instru-
ment that assures the com-

live to see them through.

Life insurance is unique
this way. It's guaranteed to

Students Fear Prestige Loss

  

With State University Status

Student reaction of the University be-
coming a state school centered around the
question, “Will it lower the standards?”
Most students were in favor of lowering tui-
tion, but not prestige.

Barry McKnight, Panther fullback and
liberal arts senior, stated that “it is a good

' idea if the tuition drops and the University gets

the-money needed for the building expansion,“ but
becoming a state school would “make a diploma
mean less; a Pitt diploma has more prestige than
a Penn State diploma. It would lower the standards
for the mass of students.” 6

“Maybe ten years from now I won’t be proud
to say I came from Pitt,” said Eline Bohm, a jun-
ior majoring in physical education and history,
“I wish we would stay where we are.”

A junior in education, felt the quality of the
students would lower if the University became a
state- school, because “we’ve paid 8» large amount
of tuition, almost like an Ivy League school, for
the prestige it gives; if we become a state school,
when we’re competing for positions we’ll have no
status.” She said “Temple went state and there
was no improvement, therefore, why would Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld do this to us?”.

Another student of the University said, “The
Board of Trustees has sold the student body out.
First they, as trustees, have a responsibility to the
students in general and the University in particu-
lar. They have relinquished their responsibilities,
by being either actively for, or passively recep-
tive to state control of the University.” She fur-
ther stated that, “I can visualize Pitt’s standards,
reputation, and future regressing to the level of
the pre-Litchfield administration.”

“Who knows,” said Tom Pasternak, a junior
chemistry major, “It depends on how the faculty
will change. If the tuition is lessened and the fac-
ulty quality is kept,” then becoming a state school
is gQ)Od.

Luci‘ Correnti, a speech senior, felt that the
University costs entirely too much money; and
Lawrence Lee, a student in generalstudies, also
believed thatbecoming a state school was a good
idea-. “The University would draw a lot more peo-
ple who are kept away by high tutions.”

Ron Whitﬁeld,_ an engineering senior, stated
"‘It’s a good thing. We’ve got to have money and
the only way is to go state.” Merna Selkovits, a
sociology junior, did not see “how the Univer-
sity could operate with a deﬁcit.” She felt that
becoming a state university was a possible solution.

Friday saw another chapter added to

the University-state aid saga.

Chancellor Litchfield appeared that day

 before a state senate sub-committee hear-

"ing on plans to establish a state university

fin Western Pennsylvania. The report that
.--Tmthe Chancellor read clearly. suggested that
.. _ ' although the University is the mostbroad-
I  ly diversiﬁed center of higher learning in
. this area, a status transfer to that of a
 state university is not the answer to Penn-

sylvania’s low cost higher education prob-

v; -lem in this region. _
5 . What the report offered were not al-
 ternatives, but suggestions on how this
 problem could be partially alleviated
 -throughthe University. The Chancellor re-
 peatedly noted that this University is not
“lithe complete answer to low-cost education.
 -He did indicate that the University could
~  "‘do much to further higher education in the
  tri-state area. The problem that remained
‘ was how this should be done. Maintenance

 of the status quo, the Chancellor pointed .
-. out, has certain ﬂaws in it. One of the most

_  important being the poorly defined rela-
‘T tionship between the institution and ’ the

” state.

Another suggestion offered was that we
have contracts with the state for certain
programs such as we have now for our

A _ schools of medicine and library sciene. Such

a system has worked well with Cornell and
New York State.

’ But despite the suggestions made, it is
clear that the University is not actually
seeking closer ties with the Commonwealth

- of Pennsylvania. Chancellor Litcihﬁeld
. V -brought out excellent points against our

becoming a strictly state university.

I sHumphrey Hits Students

lWhere are the Rest of You?

The Chancellor also pointed out that the

I reason for a state institution in this area

is a low cost to the students. Litchfield
noted that this is not always the best an-
swer. Low cost in tuition means that many
who could afford the higher costs would
be getting “a free ride” at the taxpayers’
expense. W-hat the Chancellor repeatedly
has said before and again brought out at
this meeting was that a state-wide system
of scholarships for needy students is need-
ed. This allows the student to attend those
colleges where he or she would ﬁnd the best
curriculum for them but couldn't afford the
tuition. ’

Beside allowing the student to pick the
college he-wduld like to attend, it saves the
expense of building a completely new uni-
versity. The Chancellor made a-strong point
when he stated that few universities and
colleges are using their facilities to their
fullest as can be done under the trimester
system.

The Chancellor also noted that if the
University became a state institution it
might cause hard ship on the other schools
in the immediate area might suffer be-
cause of the aid we would receive.

Chancellor Litchfield is to be congra-
tulated for stating the case for this Uni-
versity. He was very careful in making
sure that the views he stated were those
of the University, and not his own. The
legislators cannot but see how this Uni-
versity is thinking about a change of stat-
us. They should be and are obligated to
consider carefully the suggestions put forth
by our Chancellor. If they do not, higher
education in this area of the state will con-
tinue to be an increasingly serious problem.

On Thursday Hubert Hum-
phrey was mad and -he had
every right to be. Moreover
he was angry at the college
students of the United
States, and we are at fault.
The subject was naturally

' our attitude towards the Vi-

etnam situa-
tion.

Because the
Vice - Presi-
dent enjoys
the vigor of
college audi-
ences, he
wasn’t satis-
ﬁed to just

FRANK
make a speech. He wanted
some questions from the
students.

The second questioner was
a perfect example of what
the Vice-President was talk-

C  ' ing about .— the essentially

negative quality of the vocal

 students. The young man

seemed to fail to realize that
he was talking to the sec-
ond highest elected official
of the nation.

THE YOUNG MAN’S

} tone was antagonistic and
._ ‘ condescending. With his
 . hands in a prayerful clasp
 and in sanctimonius tones he

queried the Vice - President

about how a liberal like
Humphrey could justify our
tactics in Vietnam. It was a
disgusting, egotistical per-

 formance. To quote one
‘ i member of the audience “He

is the kind of guy who gets

 ‘kicks out -‘of’? asking ‘those -

 

 

kind of questions.”

Indeed he probably was.
And he played right into
Humphery’s hand. The Vice-
President is probably one of
the most able and stirring
orators on the American po-
litical scene. The students’
questions had a swiss cheese
of loopholes and was no chal-
lenge to this master. It was
truly entertaining to watch
him rip apart the questions
with emotion and verve.

Humphrey had no problem
bringing the audience to a
standing ovation when he
ﬁnished answering the ques-
tion. He simply and empha-
tically told the young man

that the United States in-

tends to stay in Vietnam be-
cause the government isgo-
ing to protect free nations
everywhere. And we are go-
ing to win, he said.

BUT THE VICE-PRESI-
DENT said something much
more important in the course
of his blistering response.
When the subject of barbar-
ic tactics came up, Hum-
phrey gave shocking exam-
ples of the primitive barbar-
ism of Viet-Cong infiltrat-
ors. He said what really dis-
turbed him was that the col-
lege students of the country
were constantly complaining

- about our policy in Vietnam

and failing to educate the
American people about the
facts of the Viet-namese sit-

‘tuati0  -«~-V». vs. V

 

This is not a man who
called for a - uninimity of
thought; all he asked for is
a uninimity of purpose. If
he went away feeling he did

. not have a uninimity of opin-

ion with the younger ques-
tioner, he was, in all proba-
bility, tragically correct
The vast majority of the
students of the United
States can no longer remain
silent on the issue of Viet-
nam. Those who support the
United States policy in Vi-
etnam must speak out. By
simple count of number it is
evident that those who vic-
lently oppose the President's
policy are not the majority.
If the majority has failed to

speak because of a lack of
education of the issues, then

they must learn them

They must speak out and
rise to a defense of these
policies. We can never have
a democracy when the mass,
particularly the college edu-
cated, remain ignorant and
silent. Probably there has
not been the desired defense
of U.S. policy -because, the
majority simply does not un-
derstand the issues well
enough to speak on them.

_ Concerning the Vice-Pres-
1dent’s words last Thursday,
I say to students “Follow
them, live up to them.” To
the Vice-President I say a
 «Bravo.»

Non-Surprise
By Merrily Kodis

_ ‘An editorial in last Wednesday's Pittsburgh Press en-
titled “The Loaded Teach-Ins” expressed its non-surprise
at the fact that a teach-in on the Vietnam situation was to
be held here and at Carnegie Tech Saturday. Since, the
Press stated, teach-ins were a “fashionable fad” on Ameri-
can campuses, the fact that it would “spread” here could
have been expected. -

Alluding to the teach-in as a “so-called debate,” the
editorial attacked previous teach-ins as “loaded in favor of
opponents of Washington’s policies.” In referring to the fact
that more than 40 college faculty members were scheduled
to speak at the evening session of the teach-in here, the

Press expressed its lack of hope that a “reasonable number '

of these professors will take the ‘pro’ side of the discussion
of American foreign policy.” .

The Press also referred to the audiences of previous
teach-ins as “hostile, preferring to ignore . . . frustrating
dilemmas of international issues and favoring . . simple
solutions to complex problems.” ‘

CON CEDIN G THAT if “properly conducted” the teach-
in at the University could be an aid to understanding of U.S.
foreign policy, the Press despairingly concluded that “the
course of such demonstrations at other colleges and univers-
ities does not support such a hope” for “most of them have
given rise to the idea that their organizers were more inter-
ested in propaganda than in fac .”

The Press accompanied its non-hope of a “properly con-

ducted” teach-in at the University with its further non-sur-'

prise that “the chief organizer of the so-called debate here
is Dr. Robert G. Colodny, Associate Professor of History at
Pitt who,” the Press emphasized, “was affiliated with the
pro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee.”

THE PITTSBURGH PRESS editorial has directly or
indirectly questioned both a University function and a Uni-
versity professor. The newspaper’s “lack of hope” that the
University’s teach-in would be “properly conducted” and re-
ceived by anyone other than a hostile, simple—so1ution-seek-

ing-audience represents a general attack on the teach-in _

concept

By its implication that the chief organizer of the Uni-
versity teach-in is one of those the Press refers to as “more
interested in propaganda than in fact,” the editorial more
directly assaulted the leadership responsible for theiteach-
in.

The Press’s allusion to Dr. Colodny as affiliated with
the pro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee is an ex-
ample of the _very thing that the Press so deplored in its
editorial, i.e., irresponsible interest in propaganda rather
than in fact. The fact is that four years ago Dr Colodny
was exonerated by a three-man University committee which
concluded in their report that “Dr. Colodny is a. loyal Amer-
ican, is not now and never had been a Communist, and is
not a subversive person as defined by the Pennsylvania
Loyalty Act of 1951.”

The editorial neglected to mention Dr. Colodny’s clear-
ance of any Communist affiliation, and preferred instead
to imply that he (and the University teach-in) was “more
interested in propaganda than in fact.”

THE PRESS’ general despair of previous teach-ins,
based on its descriptions of certain reactions of student au-
diences and the “loaded” anti-Administration nature of its
participants, fails to bring out. other facts about previous
teach-ins.

Among these are Washington’s apparent respect for
the teach-ins and the general concern over Vietnam policy
that they represent as evidenced by its willingness to par-
ticipate; and the fact, as pointed out by Irv Garfinkel in
The Pitt News last week, that advocates of current Admin-
istration policy on Vietnam have been invited to and have
participated in the teach-ins.

And if these latter participants are a less-than-reason-
able number than the Press would hope for, I suggest that
it might reflect a certain dissatisfaction and d'_ agreement
with a less-than-reasonable American policy towards Viet-
nam, rather than any “loading” of participation.

Profs, Students Comment

By MARSHA REHNS

Chancellor Edward H.
Litchﬁeld led an informal
discussion on United States
foreign policy with the audi-
ence in Stephen Foster Me-
morial Auditorium Thursday
before the arrival of Vice-

President Hubert Hum-.

phrey. - i . -_
Armouncing that the Vice-Pres-
ident would be a half hour late,
and noting “we are all here,”
the Chancellor called on mem-

— bers of the audience, especially

those professors present, to com-
ment on affairs in the Dominican
Republic and Vietnam.

Spotting Dr.‘ Carl Beck, asso-
ciate professor of political sci-
ence, in the balcony, Chancellor
Litchﬁeld asked his opinion. Dr.
Beck felt that the U.S. -had per-
formed an ad hoc action in the
Dominican Republic due -to the
“perceived situation” that Com-
munist inﬂuence was present.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld then tum-
ed to Dr. Holbert Carroll, chair-
man of the Department of Politic-
al Science, and referred to Dr.
Carroll’s book, “which didn’t
have the answer even though it
is a very good book.”

Dr. Carroll felt that the Unit-
ed States had been caught up in
the emotionalism of the situation
in the Dominican Republic es-
pecially out of fear ‘of another
Cuban crisis.

He explained that the U.S. had
become involved in a “_dual poli-
cy:" the abjuration of interfer-
ence in “reasonably democratic
nations,” and the desire for a
stable, non-communist regime.

Dr. Hibberd Kline, Jr., chair-
man of the geography depart-
ment, quipped that all the pro-
fessors were on the “right side
of the balcony” and also apolo-
gized for his lack of authority on
Latin America.

- -He pointed -out that the Mon-
roe Doctrine was out of date,
and that the U.S. was in a posi-

SUB Adds New Posts;
Plans Added Program

The Special Interest and House Committee of the Stu-
dent Union Board (SUB) were given full Board positions

this trimester

The purpose of the House Committee, whose chairman
is Cynthia Corbett, is to make the Student Union more com-
fortable for the students by improving the decore, policy,
conduct, and condition of the SU building. One of the ﬁrst

projects is to decorate the Cub’s
Den, by ﬁnishing the “Peanut’s”
caricatures on the walls, putting
up pennants, and making the
Den more attractive to girls, so
it can be a place for all students
to enjoy.

The committee will also host
the SUB coffee hour, from 3 to
5 p.m. on the Wednesday’s when
there are no Midday programs,
providing the student body and
faculty with a chance to so-
cialize and mix.

Small groups programming is
the aim of the Special Interests
Committee and committee chair-
man, Merna Selkovits. Some of
the program ‘includes: poetry
readings, guitar lessons, a music-

al program this Monday, two
art exhibits in June and July,
and a fall fashion preview for
men and women. -

The two new committees will
serve to improve the SU build-
ing, and provide the Universty
with a varied series of small
group programs. .

Anyone interested in assisting
the House Committee can obtain
applications at the SU desk or
may contact Cynthia Corbett.

tion to “engender better feeling”
among the Latin American states
prior to the Dominican revolt. '

“I don’t know if the U.S. ac-
tion (in the Dominican Repub-
lie) is right or wrong,” he said
and concluded that it is the
opinion of Latin American na-
tions that will answer this ques-
tion.

The Chancellor then threw the

» discussion open to the students.

The ﬁrst student commented that
the American people are frus-

_ trated by the resemblance of the

administration's policies towards
Vietnam and the Dominican Re-
public to those proposed by Barry
Goldwater. The Chancellor was
quick to point out that he meant
the administration in Washing-
ton.

The second volunteer declared
that the President, who had giv-
en the “image of "Franklin Roose-
velt as solace during the cam-
paign” was becoming “more like
Teddy.” He queried if-. “we are
going to sit by as "the U.S. insti-
tues the imperialism of the ear-
ly 19th century.”

TESTS, AND HOW THEY GREW ,

Just the other night I was saying to the little woman, “Do
you think the importance of tests in American colleges is
being overemphasized?”. (Incidentally, the little woman is
not, as you might think, my wife. My wife is far from a lit-
tle woman. She is, in fact, nearly seven feet high and man-
tled with rippling muscles. She is a full-blooded Ogallala
Sioux and holds the world's shot put record. The little
woman I referred to is someone‘ we found crouching under

' the sofa when we moved into our apartment back in 1928,
and there she has remained ever since. She never speaks-

except to make a kind of guttural clicking sound when she
is hungry. To tell you the truth, she's not too much fun to
have around the house, but with my wife away at track meets
most of the time, at least it gives me someone to talk to.)

But I digress. “Do you think the importance of tests in
American colleges is being overemphasized?” I said the
other night to the little woman, and then I said, “Yes,
Max, I do think the importance of tests in American col-
leges is being overemphasized.” (As I explained, the little
woman does not speak, so when we have conversations, I
am forced to do both parts.)

But I digress. To get back to tests-—sure, they're impor-
tant, but let’s not allow them to get too important. There
are, after all, many talents which simply can't be measured
by quizzes. Is it right to penalize a gifted student whose
gifts don’t happen to fall into an academic category? Like,
for instance, Finster Sigafoos? '

   
 

She is a full-blooded
Ogallala Sioux . . .

Finster, a freshman at the Wyoming College of Belles
Lettres and Fingerprint Identiﬁcation, has never passed a
single test; yet all who know him agree he is studded with
talent like a ham with cloves. He can, for example, sleep
standing up. He can do a perfect imitation of a scarlet tan-

' ager. (I don’t mean just the bird calls; I mean he can ﬂy

south in the winter.) He can pick up BB’s with his toes. He
can say “toy boat” three times fast. He can build a rude
telephone out of 100 yards of string and two empty Person-
na Stainless Steel Razor Blade packages. (This last accom-
plishment is the one Finster is proudest of—not building

the telephone but emptying the Personna packs. To empty.

a Personna pack is not easily accomplished, believe you me,
not if you’re a person who likes to get full value out of his
razor blades. And full value is just what Personnas deliver.
They last and last and keep on lasting; luxury shave follows
luxury shave in numbers that make the mind boggle. Why
don’t you see for yourself? Personnas are now available in
two varieties: a brand—new stainless steel injector blade for
users of injector razors—and the familiar double-edge stain-
less steel blade so dear to the hearts and kind to the kissers
of so many happy Americans, blades so smooth—shaving, so
long-lasting that the Personna Co. makes the following
guarantee: If you don’t agree Personna gives you more lux-
ury shaves than Beep-Beep or any other brand you might
name, Personna will buy you a pack of whatever kind you
think is better.)

But.I digress. Back to Finster Sigafoos—-artist, humanist,
philosopher, and freshman since 1939. Will the world ever

beneﬁt from F_inster’s great gifts? Alas, no. He is in college

to stay.

But even more tragic for mankind is the case of Clare de
Loon. Clare, a classmate of Finster’s, had no talent, no
gifts, no brains, no personality. All she had was a knack for
taking tests. She would cram like mad before a test, always
get a perfect score, and then promptly forget everything
she had learned. Naturally, she graduated with highest
honors and degrees by the dozen, but the sad fact is that
she left college no more educated and no more prepared to
cope with the world than she was when she entered. Today,
a broken woman, she crouches under my sofa.

@1965. Max Shulman

Speaking of tests, we, the makers of Personna®, put .
our blades through an impressive number before we
send them to market. We also make—and thoroughly
test—an aerosol shave that soaks rings around ’any
other lather: Burm'a_Sh_av,e@-, regular ayndg-fmenthol.‘ -,:...\~_~

 

 

Dave Johnson Name  

Dynamic coaching_continues to domin- _
"ate wrestling with last Friday’s appoint-

ment of Dave Johnson as new head wrest-
ling coach. Johnson replaces coach Rex
Peery, who retired earlier this year after
30 years coaching wrestling.

Peery was one of the most colorful
coaches in the country during his 15 years
here. He was Free Style Wrestling Coach

" for the United States in the 1964 Olympics,

this year’s NCAA _championship program
was in his honor, and he compiled a 116-43-
3 record here.

JOHNSON PLANS to bring the same
steadfast style to his coaching job that he

. used as a. wrestler. While wrestling here

under Peery, he won the 157-pound Eastern
title in 1956, ’57, and ’58. .

“Wrestling isn’t as big here now as
when I was wrestling” said Johnson. “We
were at our peak in those years. I plan to
build a power here, though it may take a
few years.” .

His ‘biggest obstacle to power-building
remains recruiting. When Peery resigned
because “30 years is enough in one sport,”
many people claimed increased recruiting
pressures were the real reasons.

“REX HAS found it harder to both re-
cruit and ‘keep boys in school during the
last two or three years,” said Athletic Di-
rector Frank Carver. But Johnson proposes
a unique solution to recruiting woes.

“I understand it’s -harder to get admit-
ted than it was ﬁve years ago, “Johnson
said, “but I am confident there are many
smart high school wrestlers.” He cited a
current top prospect from Lock Haven who

“‘will have no trouble getting admitted

here.”
Johnson’s plan is to get these wrestlers

Ohio U. Downs Trackmen;
I)elV.ecchio Sweeps Events

By RON SHEARER

The track team took a big step toward a losing season
by losing, 72-59, at Ohio University Saturday.

Ohio U. used superior manpower to beat the r..'ackstei's.
They swept the 880, the mile run, and won the mile relay.
In the 100-yard dash and three-mile run, they also placed

two men.
The Ohioans also took advan-

leg and could not compete in the
meet.

Paul Lambert ﬁnished second
in the 120-yard highs and Fred
Poellnitz took a third in the 440-
yard hurdles, giving the track-
sters only four points.

Sprinter Bill DelVecchio con-
tinued his winning ways, taking
ﬁrsts in the 100 and 220, and
leading the 440 relay team to a
victory. In winning the 100, Del-
Vecchio tied his own University
record with a time of 9.6 sec-
onds. It was the third time this
year that DelVecchio has match-

The top two positions changed" __

last week, but the tennis team
won only one of three matches,
they beat Slippery Rock, 6-3, but
lost to Bucknell, 9-0, and Came-

“During a practice session Last

Ben Pope, explaining the change.
“He won, 6-2 and 6-2. Donatelli

Liebowitz was the only one to

also came from behind to beat

Lead Team Over Tech
By GEORGE LIES '
The golf team tries to make Saint.Vincent their second
victim of the season today at 1:30 pm. at Ohartiers Coun-
try ‘Club. Last Friday, Carnegie Tech became their first,

losing 81/2-1/2 The golfers also captured third place in a tri-
angular match at Ohio, losing to Ohio University, 19-5,

and Toledo, 17-7, Saturday.

Tech fulﬁlled one-third of the
golfers’ quota. If they beat St.
Vincent today, and Duquesne
University Thursday, they will
equal last year’s total wins. They
have lost nine.

Phil Fassett and Clair Riley,
both shooting 76’s, led the team
against Tech. ‘Fassett defeated
Dale Johnson, one up, but had
to win the ﬁnal four holes to
ﬁnish ahead. Riley’s four-over
par helped him beat the Tartan’s
John Malhaland, six up.

In the best ball (per hole per
foursome) competition, Fassett
and Riley continued their unde-

feated streak of 19 matches over
the past three years. It is a rare
bright spot in the team’s poor
record for the same period.

Against the Ohio teams, Bill
Baloh, who is considered “the
most improved and the most con-
sistent golfer” by coach Rex
Peery, shot a team low of 77.
Dick Winters and Fassett turned
in cards with 78’s.

REPORTERS

 

(Continued from Page 1.)
Chancellor explained that the
Commonwealth could contract
with the University for certain

. “educational services which the

state wishes to have available.”

Such a plan, explained the
Chancellor would involve the
representation of the state ad-
vninistration on the University’s

. ooard of trustees, by the gover-

University into an entirely state
institution, with a “drastic” re-
duction in tuition. He saw this,

, I however, as an unnecessary drain
‘ * on state funds because students
’ who could afford the high tuition

would “beneﬁt from the reduc-

‘ “ . ‘tion in the same way as do the

students who cannot afford it.”
He also pointed out that the

amount of private contributions
to the University would diminish
if it became a state institution.
He asked that the state con-
tinue the University’s present
“state-aided” status for one year
accompanied by the increases in
funds that the University has re-
quested and hoped that a joint
University and state proposal
would be prepared for the 1966

maintain its cosmopolitan char-
acter to continue the excellence
of its faculty and instruction.
Funds for programs of diversity

‘ and quality are “now high and '

will increase,” he concluded.
Deviating from his usual meth-
od, the Chancellor read his
Speech directly from prepared
copy so as not pu “any? oi our

faculty or board of trustees in a
position in which I have no right
to put; them.”

In response to questionning,
the Chancellor stressed the need
for an increase in technical and
community colleges and in oppor-
tunities for post-baccalaureate
work.’ -

As the head of a University he
felt it was not his place to com-

10.7 per cent of the University’s
budget whereas ten years ago
they made up 27 per cent.

He noted that no students have
been denied admission to the
University because of lack of fa-
cilities and that the University,
except for dormitories, is not used
to capacity. The new Towers
should fulﬁll the one need.
