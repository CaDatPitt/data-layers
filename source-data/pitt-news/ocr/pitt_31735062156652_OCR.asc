, BULLETIN

F1gures received at 5 o'clock Monday placed the
fund total at $1400. This leaves the drive $1100 short
of the necessary $2500.

With practically every campus source tapped,
receipts and pledges to the ‘Send the Band to
Notre Dame’ fund yesterday amounted to appro-
ximately half of the $2500 goal set for the band
trip. Backers of~the drive, who put on an inten-
sive campaign last week, called for all-out sup-
port to get the remainder by Friday.

Reports of pending mass contributions by
one or more Pittsburgh firms still circulated
about campus, but no official confirmation or
denial of the rumors could be secured.

IF Council’s collection teams reported cash
contributions of $672.50 as of Friday night,
with an estimated $100 collected at the rally
and the game over the weekend. The latter figure
represented a much smaller amount than had
been hoped for, President Jim Morton stated.

One of the largest individual contributions
received since Mayor David Lawrence’s $25
check arrived last week was the $20 donation

 

made by Tony Messino, who turned over re-
ceipts made from the sale of the New York
Herald-Tribune's annual Educational Forum
issue.

Messino, a former student now awaiting in-
duction into the army, sold the special issue on
campus over the weekend, then gave his 319
earnings plus an additional dollar to the fund
in the name of his fraternity, Kappa Beta Phi.

A Miami University Band member gave 310
to the drive after Friday's joint rally. In addition
to fraternities mentioned in Friday's Pitt News,
Phi Mu sorority and Alpha Phi Omega service
fraternity made donations. Other fraternity con-
tributions are still anticipated.

Two more alumni, builder W. F. Trimble, and
newscaster Mead Mulvehill, sent in checks for
$10.

Men’s Council Thursday voted $100 of non-
appropriation funds to the campaign, as did the
Dentistry and Pharmacy Schools.

At least $200 was collected at the Letter-
men’s banquet Friday night, 3315 coming from
All- American Marshall Goldberg.

A complete list of donors is being held up
until all contributions are in.

Checks from alumni and non-University con-
tributors continued to dribble in to the Pitt News
office, but the general trend was such that _drive
leaders felt that only a major individual"contri-
bution or an unexpected avalanche of smaller do-
nations would fill out the band fund cashbox.

Although it was felt that every student will-
ing to contribute had already been approached,
fraternity men expected to continue circula ting
coin boxes about the campus as they did all
last week.

A blow to the campaign was the reluctance
of University officials to allow general collec-
tions to be made among non-University specta-
tors at Saturday's football game. Original plans
wire based on such a collection, but were scrap-
ped after the decision was handed down.

Campaign leaders felt that the drive would
have to be terminated by the end of this week
so as not to conflict with the annual Pitt Chest
drive. In addition, the band will need time to

make arrangements for the trip.

The comedy opens Thursday in Fos-

"This was probably the finest Homecoming we've had at Pitt

for years.”

This was the conclusion of J. Clyde Barton, alumni secretary,

yesterday morning after the last alumnus had gone home.

Mr. Barton was lavish in his
praise of the student body of which
he said, "their spirit tipped the
balance in favor of a great Home-
coming.” '
"Thanks to the students,” Mr.
Barton went on to say, "we had

something that looked like a Home-
coming.”

The weekend started Friday night
with the Varsity Letter Club dinner
at the Hotel Schenley. Attended by
approximately 80 people, the dinner
was addressed by Marshall Gold-
berg, former All-American Pitt
back; Captain Tom Hamilton, di-
rector of Athletics; Andy Gustafuson,

A first year dental student
from Perrysville Avenue is the
"son of Dr. George Fischer, grad-

Fischer is also the grandson
of Dr. George Fischer, a gradu-

After the dinner a stud nt rally
was held on the Bellefield side of

Rege Cordic, local disk jockey
and a former Pitt student, the rally
was filled with cheers for both

After the Pitt-Miami game there
were several fraternities and sorori-
ties holding open house for alumni.
Mr. Barton, stated that several Pitt
graduates gave parties for the
alumni.

Topping off the program for the
weekend was the freshman-sponsor

ions in the coming state election,
will be continued up until the issue
of Tuesday, Nov. 7, election day.

Sp far, the students have shown
almost unanimously that the state-
graft probe now being conducted
in Pittsburgh had had no affect on
their choice for governor and sena-
tor.

The poll with its present figures
proves that the student body of Pitt
does have an interest in political
el dltions and their outcome. Stu-
dents in all schools said that they
definitely had a knowledge of the

issues at stake and were interested
in the election outcome.

Upperclass Court Makes
The Penalty Fit The Crime

Upperclass Court decided on a
definite policy for dink offenders
last week at its regular meeting.

Any freshman who does not wear
his dink, excepting in class pr in
the Commons Room, is considered
a “dink offender.” If he is caught
and his name is taken, a post card
will be sent to his home ordering
himtoreporttothe Upperclass Court,
which meets we ekly.

The policy s.et by the court was:

1. First offenders will be re-
leased with a warning if they have a
sufficient reason, such as losing or
forgetting the dink.

2. Freshman brought before the

court for the second time will have

to take orientation again nezit sem- '1

ester or make a 95% grade on this
semester’s orientation te st.

3. Any freshman who does not
obey the Court will be placed on the
dean of men’s probationary list.

Any freshman who receives a

cardfor Upperclass Court and cannot 7 V

attend must submit a written report
to the dean of men’s office stating
the circumstances of his absence.

The Court made it clear that those ‘

who ignore its summons or its ver-
dict will be "firmly reprimanded”
by the dean of men’s office.

the Miami band including the drum majorettes, were given scholar-
ships. The visitors from the South went in for extravaganza and

pretty girl s.

But the Varsity Marching Band was more than a match. Its
skillful manuevering, fast-stepping execution and masterful play-
ing were far superior to the sort of razzle-dazzle brought North

by Miami.

We hope that Saturday’s performance will convince the
doubters who have hung onto their Notre Dame contributions. ‘Sup-
port for the drive has so far been heartening but there stillihas
not been enough money collected to send the band to Notre Dame.

No contribution is too small. A spare dollar, an extra four bits

Notre Dame NOTES By LEONARD BAKER

When Pitt Special arrives in
South Bend on November 11 it’s
going to find two surprises— the
town and the school.

South Bend goes out for foot-
ball in a big way. Anyone with a
spare room rents it out to the thou-
sands who move in every football
weekend. This isn’t just to make
money.» The towispeople know that

-‘there are too many people to be

housed by the few hotels. The people
wantto see footballcontinue. They're
willing to support their team in what-
ever way they can.
The stadium is on the campus, on

the edge of town. Whenthe thousands

' of people journey out for the game,

a traffic problem should be created.
It just isn’t sol Before the game all
streets are one-way in the direction
of the stadium, all buses are taken
off their regular route and aimed at
Notre Dame. After the game the sit-
uation is just reversed; all streets
are one-way going away from the
stadium, all buses are used to take
the spectators away from the game.
‘On a football Saturday afternoon
the South Bendite cango only to two

. places -- to the stadium or away from

the stadium.
But the town won't be as much of
a surprise as the school. The stu-

dent who’s used to a campus that
starts from a city block and goes up
can't picture Notre Dame.

The first glimpse of the school is
seen as the Pitt Special nears South
Bend. The Golden Dome, atop the

Administration Building, first catches
the Panther’s eye. The 15,000 dollar
gilded dome shines in the sun as
the train pulls in.

The dome overlooks five square
miles of campus that includes not
only school buildings but two lakes,
both suitable for swimming with one
especially adapted to swimming in
the nude because of the trees around
it and a golf course where students
play for 10¢ a game. There are of
course the ordinary accoutrements

such as tennis courts and the like.-

The

graduate students have the

added advantage ofthe Knute Rockne’

Memorial Hall, a gym for their con-
venience.

There are no fraternities on cam-
pus. The students are housed in
dormitories that carry on their own
activities. Social affairs are held in
conjunction with a girl's college
acros s the way.

Victories, or defeats such as the
recent cases, are celebrated overa
brew at the Saatigan Bar, where any-
one who can raise his voice over a

iibeer or a coke is always welcome.

‘headline writer is dreaming, lazy,

l Overset

The pre-game pep rally last Fri-
day night was one of the best-
attended that this campus has seen
in years.

The combination of the Miami
drum majorettes, the fraternity and
sorority open houses, the Miami
drum majorettes, the Pitt band
Alumni Homecoming, and the Miami
drum majorettes were u doubtedly
factors which brought out the pre-
dominantly male crowd. The Miami
drum majorettes may have helped
produce the large turnout, too.

Even the Miami band members
agreed that our band looked and
sounded mighty sharp. Rege Cor-
dic slipped (?) and complimented
them as one of the biggest Dixie-
land bands in the country after
they took off on one jazzy piece.

Rebe|sCharge

The Hurricane
shouted protests, then‘ blew an
impromptu chorus of “Dixie” while
their cheerleaders led a charge
around the inside of the ring of
spectators, carrying the Confed-
erate flag.

Andy Schurman, dressed as the
Panther, threw a block on the color
bearer, and the flag went down for
a minute. Andy’s suit makes a good
cushion, but he twisted his ankle,
and until late Saturday morning he
didn’t know whether he’d make it
to the game or not.

The front page headline on Fri-
day, you remember, read “Pitt
Faces Unbeaten Miami.” Roy W.
Henley, veterans accountant from
the 24th floor, sent down a little"
note and a clipping of the head
with paper pasted over the F, the
UN, and the en. He suggested:
"Today's headline could so easily
be edited, as enclosed, for Tues-
day’s “News” that I wonder if your

band_ members

or both.”

Well, Mr. Henley, he.’s usually
dreaming, always lazy, and usually
needs a both, but I think we’re
agreed that he’s certainly not a
prophet.

Overweight Girls

Girls, are you worried about your
figure? You might try forming a
women’scross-country team. These
boys who run about five miles or
more daily lose as much as 12 to
18 pounds while getting in shape.
The ‘heaviest’ man on the squad,
Ed Carnegie, weighed only 139
the last time I heard, and most of
the team tips the scales in the
120's. Light or not, they’ve been
beaten only once this season.

Incidentally, there may even be
a little glory in this sport for girls
willing to hit the Schenley Park
bridle trails on foot. The Pitt-Penn
State meet wa-s televised on Pitt
Parade, one day before the Phi

Mus and AEPhis became famous.

Bandaides have been prominent around Senior fingers at Wichi-
gan State recently. They haven't been analyzing mouse traps,
playing with fans, or other unknown Senior activity. .

It seems that Seniors at State have an ’annual habit of carving
theirinirialsinto a table top placed in the Old College hall espec-

ially for that purpose.

At the first senior Coffee llour
this year,knives and bandaids were
way ahead ofthe coffeein popularity.
The table top, of white pine, is five
feet in diameter. When Michigan’s
seniors have finished cutting their
fingers and carving the wooden sur-
face, it will be sanded , shellacked,
and hung in Old College hall with a
bronze plaque set in it.

Math majors may soon be flocking
to the University of Akron. The
mathematics department there has
defied tradition and set up a file of
past math exams in the university’s
library.

According to the head of the de-

partment, Professor S. Selby, the

plan should be a big step in elimin-
atingcheating. Testsofthe previous
four semesters can be found in the

file.

Enclosed please find my check
for ten dollars as some small con-
tribution toward the Pitt Band’s trip
to South Bend. Being in the radio
game, I can appreciate the fine
public relations that would be
broughtabout by the Band’s appear-t
ance on both radio and TV. In addi-
tion to that, and perhaps even more
important,is the great morale boost
for the team itself. We’ve got a
great team this season, and it cer-
tainly deserves the support of every;
one of us at the University. I V

I’m only sorry that I won't be
able to see or hear the game, but as
fate would have it, I'll be reading
the commercials on another game
being played at the same time.
(Mutual’s Game of the Week.) In any
event my good wishes are with the
team and, of course, and band.

I hope this helps make the Pitt
News Drum completely black.

Has the towing-away of student
cars, parked near the university,
become another police racket?

Don’t the police have anything to
do at high noon except spot cars,
parked technicallyin the wrong spot,
and inform nearby garage towing
serviceslso the car can be towed
away at a recovery cost of $5.00 to

the student?

Why do nearby garage towing ser-
vices do the towing instead of the
official City of Pittsburgh towing
trucks?

We all know that the parking
situation in Oakland has been very
acute for a long time, yet the city
police department evidently does
not want to Mr. Average Citizen and
Mr. Student.

On Tuesday, October 24, my car
was parked at the top of Parkman
St. (almost a dead-end and little
used street). Since there was a yel-
low line at the curve, I pulled the
car ‘off the street and next to the
high stone wall at a point where,
technically, a sidewa_lk should be.
But there ‘is no sidewalk, and the
rough ground at this point is not
Fused for a walkway. A police de-
partment officer tagged my car at

high neon,and after classes.at 2:30,
I found my car had disappeared.

After recovering my car at the
Pittsburgh police towing garhge at
a towing cost of $5.00 (and a $2.00
parking tag fee, to be paid later),
the clerk there informed me that it
was towed in by an Oakland garage
towing service.

Perhaps Attorney General Margi-
otti should investigate this towing
procedure of our police and find out
why‘ nearby garages get the benefit
of the $5.00 towing _serv ice fee.

Perhaps the citizens of Pittsburgh
would have better protection from
night murderers and attempted rapes
if our high noon policemen were as-
signed to beats after dark inste adof
being: spotters for towing garages
during daylight hours.

Sincerely,
Fred M. Gastel

Cas Hears Howling of Wolves
_ Fans Ask Why Osterhout
Saw So Little Action

‘A:

By WILL DOERGE ’
Pitt has now lost five straight games this season, and no
doubt Coach Len Casanova is feeling mighty uncomfortable these

days.

The howling of the football wolves has been steadily increas-
ing in volume each week and reached a new high as Miami of

Florida
Saturday.

A victory over West Virginia here
this week might cool things off for
the Panther mentor, but the Casa-
nova-baiters will probably argue
that “we were expected to win that
one anyway.”

Nevertheless, the Panthers are
finally playing a team in their own
class and should be the favorite
for the first time this year against
their traditional rivals, the Mount-
aineers.

The anti-Casanova crowd found
plenty to crow about in the Miami

and then passed for another 20

that the Pitt line was the best he
had faced all season. "They were
good and rough,” he said.

The Pitt dressing room was
dead silent. Backfield Coach
Jack Roche, who viewed the sorry
sight from the pressbox, agreed
with the hundreds of fans who
saw the game when he said that
the Pitt offense must begin to
open up.

Asked whether he thought the
leaky Pitt pass defense was re-
sponsible for the fifth straight
loss, Roche replied, “If we had
the perfect pass defense out there
today. the final score would have
been 0-0. You have to score
points to win ball games."

The remark of the day was uncon-

Frosh Hold Army Scoreless
For 50 Minutes, Win 16-13

By DON MURDOCK
The undefeated Pitt freshman football team, after taking the Army
plebes in camp, 16-13, on Saturday, has almost three weeks to cele-

brate, while the Pitt jayvees have
almost a month to lick their wounds
after dropping a 41-7 decision to
the Army jayvees.

The frosh next play West Vir-
ginia in a benefit for Kiwanis
charities at Bridgeville, Pa., Nov.
17. Tickets are on sale at the
Athletic Office. The jayvees are
inactive until Nov. 24 when they
meet Penn State here.

A pass, a field goal, an extra
point, and a 15-yard run accounted
for the Pitt frosh victory. _In the
first period Quarterback Manuel
Campa flipped a 35-yard pass to
End Bill Adams for the first tally.
Halfback Lou Cimarolli raced 15
yards for Pitt’s second score in
the second period with Halfback
Art DiGiovanni tacking on the extra
point by placement.

In the third quarter the 180-pound
DiGiovanni, a Mt. Lebanon product,
gave the Panther Cubs a 16-0 lead
by booting a 27-yard field goal. Army
scored two touchdowns in the last
nine minutes of the game, the last
one coming on the final play of the
game. Pitt’s line, led by Tackle
John Rage‘ and Guard Dave Adams,
was outstanding in holding Army
scoreless for over 50 minutes.

Injuries and lack of manpower
figured prominently in the jayvee
defeat.

With only 21 players making the
trip and a number of injuries being
incurred during the game, the odds

Ohio State Harriers
Hand Pitt Second Loss

Like the Pitt football team, the
Blue-and-Gold cross country team
lost on Saturday, but they weren't
shut out. ’

In a very close meet at Columbus
the Pitt thinclads bowed to Ohio
State, 24-31. Ohio State's Paul
Truex and Frank D'Arcy furnished
the one-two punch to defeat the
Panthers. Truex finished the 4-mile
course in 22:01.4.

game. “Why did Casanova again
hold out Quarterback Bob Osterhout
until the game was lost?” they
ask.

Chants of "We Want Osterhout”
were repeatedly heard from the
Pitt rooting section Saturday, but
the Panther passing ace remained
on the bench until thefourth quarter.
He was in for only one set of downs
in the first half. _

Osty completed only 3 of ll
passes for 68 yards, but his inept
receivers were responsible in part
for his poor record. His favorite
target, Halfback Bill Sichko, sat
out most of the game with injuries.

Another question puzzling many
fans after the Miami game is "When
is Pitt going to feature the wide-
open attack that is supposed to
mark the "T” formation, instead of
hitting inside the tackles time after
time and getting nowhere?”

Casanova’s defenders (he —still
has some) argue that Pitt fust
doesn't have the manpower to open
up. Pitt doesn't have the fast hard-
driving fullback necessary in the
“T,” and when Sichko isn’t in the
game, the Panthers don't have a
single threat along the ground.

In all fairness to Casanova, 7it
should be noted that he‘hasn’t had
a hale and hearty team for a single
game. And with the Marines getting
his best back, Paul Chess, before
the season opened, it's no wonder
Pitt football is in a bad state.

if The Strange Metamorphosis

  Iii Len Casanova

Before

ICU

By-MYRON KOPELMAN

Sports Editor

After

Last spring Coach Len Casanova was a happy man. If its true
that life begins at 40, then 45-year-old Cas was in the prime of

life.

He had a charming wife and a
couple of fine children. He had
just pocketed a five-figure con-
tract given him by Athletic Direct-
or Tom Hamilton.

Today, Cas is in dire need of‘

Serutan or some such other youth-
restoring medication, even if you
can spell it forwards.
Photographic Proof

For evidence, just look at
the above pictures. The photo-
graph on the left —- the one with
the dark head of hair -- was taken
last spring, the first day Cas
came to Pitt. The guy on the right
with the white hair is the same
Casanova after a half year here.

This photographic contrast is
proof positive that sports writers
do not exaggerate when they write
that such-and-such an incident
"added a few more gray hairs to
the coach’s head.”

It is doubtful if any coach in
the history of football hashad so
many troubles as Cas has had in
so short a space of time. To be
sure, a coach has got to expect
a lot of his men to incur injuries
in the course of a season. Cas had
no kick coming when his guys
came down with bum knees, bum
shoulders, and bum elbows.

Ten to Service

But when the ailments are of such
a nature that the ailing cannot even
sit down on the bench, why then,
the line has got to be drawn some-
where.

Furthermore, it is not unexpect-
ed in these times that the armed
services should call a ballplayer
or two. Yet your heart surely must
bleed for Pitt's white-domed coach
when the Pentagon gives the high
sign to no less than ten of his
stalwarts.

ball coach at Pitt and practicing
physician on the side, wrote a
series of magazine articles not
long ago entitled "The Cancer of
Coaching.” The good doctor stated
facts and figures pointing out that
the average coach dies young.

Asked to comment on the Casa-
nova case this week, Dr. Carlson
said:

“The medical profession has re-
cognized the possibility of a per-
son's hair turning white overnight
when there has been a severe shock.
That very thing happened to Queen
Josephine during the French revolu-
tion.

"Give Them Cake"

“The people were storming the
gates, and the Queen ran to her
general and asked, ‘What do they
want?’

" ‘Bread,’ replied
‘But we have none.’

“ ‘Then give them cake,
the Queen.

" ‘But we have no cake, either,’
was the retort. The Queen's hair
turned white.

"Now the Queen’s hair changed
overnight,” continued the Doctor,
“because of a single severe shock.
In the case of Cas, there has been
a series of little shocks, so the
change has merely required alength-
ier period of time in which to com-
plete itself.”

Of course, this won't satisfy the
alumni. They don't want hair. They
want blood.
