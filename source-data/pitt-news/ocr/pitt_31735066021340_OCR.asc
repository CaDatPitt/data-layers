THE

UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURCEH

By Erik Kr-idle
Asst. News Editor

A new process is being utilized
by Public Safety Director Bill
Brennan to award promotions in
rank for officers, involving the
input of individuals from outside
the department

In the past, promotions for Pitt
police officers have been based
on the judgement of the director
and other peer police officers.
However, the new process is a
drastic shift from precedent

A seven-member panel of
advisers from outside the
department was assembled in
rnid-June to conduct interviews
with each applicant for a
promotion. Brennan then gave
the panel a set of questions to ask

each ofﬁcer, and, based on the
responses to these questions, the
panel had to compile a list of the
best people for each position.

“I think it’s fair to assume that .

we could make an informed
judgement about who we would
feel most comfortable [with] in
‘the position of lieutenant or
sergeant, because, after all, their
job is to serve the university
community,” said Herbert
Chessler, panel member and
president of the University Senate.
PanelistJoanne Woodson from
the Office of Residence Life agrees
with Chessler. “I was asked to sit
on the panel, and I agreed,” she
said. “I believe the panel is a vital
new way of giving the university
at large input into the operations
of the Campus Police.”

Other panelists include Joseph
Cavalla andjames Raymond from
Student Activities, Joan Huston
from the Graduate School of
Public Health, Mary Cicali from
the Office of Business and
Finance, and a student
representative, Julie Shepard,
from the Student Government
Board.

According to Chessler, the
questions and the answers that
they should have expected were
given to the panel by Brennan
before the interviews
commenced Neither Chessler,
Brennan nor any of the other
panelists would reveal the exact

"questions asked, but Chessler

said, they were “situational in
nature." The same questions were
asked to each of the applicants,

he emphasized

Twelve individuals were
interviewed for at least two
sergeant openings, and eightwere
interviewed for the lieutenant

positions. ,

The exact number of lieutenant
promotions will not be
determined until all the

promotions are oﬂicially awarded
in September, Brennan said.

However, it is his intention, as
director and ﬁnal decision- maker
where promotions are concerned,
to award promotions based
primarily on the numerical list of
“deserving” applicants given to
him by the panel.

Brennan said he believes the

‘old process, of awarding

promotions in which only the
director and his close advisers

Advisors to assist with Public Safety promotions

would decide, was unfair.

“The university family should —
have a say in the decision-making -
process to make it more fair,” he
said.

Brennan instructed the panel
to select those applicants whom
they would feel most comfortable
with as leaders of the Campus
Police. The panel was to “pick
the people who are the most
attuned to our new service
philosophy.” _

Brennan admitted he waited
until five months after he became
director before beginning the
promotion selection process in
order to allow time for those
already in the department to .
catch Brennan's “service” vision.

Presby lost $400,000 to embezzlement schemes

(AP) —— Presbyterian-University
Hospital lost more than $400,000
through kickback and
embezzlement schemes carried
out by two former high-ranking
employees who were forced to
resign in 1987 and 1988, hospital
officials said Tuesday.

The hospital never sought
prosecution of the two
employees, however.

Robert Cindrich, the-_‘hospital’s
attorney, said the hospital did not
believe there was sufficient
evidence to win a criminal
conviction against a former chief
of security who was suspected of
taking about $220,000 in
kickbacks on inﬂated contracts
for hospital security.

Cindrich, a former U.S. attorney,
also said the hospital was reluctant
to seek charges against a former
chief ﬁnancial officer who was
accused of embezzlement.
Because the former financial
officer was a paraplegic in failing
health, the hospital did not want

embezzlement, Cindrich said.
The incidents were made public
for the first time Monday by
Pittsburgh NAACP President
Harvey Adams, who said he was
told about them by former and
current hospital employees.

FDA scientists

accepted bribes

WASHINGTON (AP) — The
commissioner of the Food and
Drug Administration told
Congress on Tuesday he is
“shocked, embarrassed and
angered” by the revelations that
FDA scientists accepted bribes
from generic drug companies.

Commissioner Frank E. Young
vowed to seek penalties against
the firms. But he said, “We’re
having a difficult time trying to
determine what we can do to
remove these particular products"
from the market.

Young and his top aides were
called before the House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee on

 

oversight and investigations,
whose chairman,}ohn D. Dingell,
D-Mich., said the scandal means
“we can no longer be reasonably
confident that the FDA is able to
detect the entry of unsafe or
inefficacious generic drugs in the
nation's pharmacies.

Young countered that a special
review of the products made by
companies implicated so far “have
uncovered no safety concerns,"
but he conceded, “We cannot be
fully confident on the issue of
product safety” until further tests
are conducted.

China refuses

to rule out trial

BEIJING (AP) — China on
Tuesday refused to rule out a trial
and further punishment for Zhao
Ziyang, who was ousted as
Communist Party chief for

opposing the military crackdown

that crushed pro—democracy
demonstrators.
“His problem is still being

investigated,” government
spokesman Yuaan Mu said at the
first news conference by high-
ranking officials since troops on
June 3-4 marched on Tiananmen
Square and attacked unarmed
demonstrators.

When the party Central
Committee ousted Zhao as
secretary—general on June 24, it
accused him of supporting the
protesters and splitting the party,
and said his case would be dealt
with internally. Since then,
however, official criticism has
escalated, fueling speculation
Zhao may stand trial.

Premier Li Peng, a key force
behind the crackdown, was
quoted last week as saying Zhao

remained at his home. Putting-

him on trial would be an extreme
measure taken only if Zhao and
his supporters are considering a
continuing threat..

Continued from pa e 1
eventual overturn, or l or state]

restrictions to the point that it
may be legal to have an abortion,
but it won’t make any difference. ”

“I have mixed feelings,” was
the response of Patricia Scott,
board of directors president of
the Southwest regional chapter
of Pennsylvanians for Human Life.
“After waiting so long it was good
to see [the decision], but there's
still a lot of work to be done in
educating people so that the value
of human life will be seen.”

Marion Damick, associate
director of the Greater Pittsburgh
American Civil Liberties Union,
expressed disappointment with
the decision, saying that it “pulled
the thread of the fabric of women’s
rights and that it would have
implications in that many of the

cases decided since Roe vs. Wade
will have to be re—litigated.”

The decision restored
provisions of a Missouri law that
were determined by a lower court
as placing undue restrictions on a
woman’s right to have an
abortion. Two provisions ban
the use of public facilities for the
performance of abortions and
prevent any public health
employee from performing or
assisting an abortion.

According to Darnick, this
restriction is particularly severe
in Missouri, where most of the
abortions are performed in one
public hospital.

“What [the Supreme Court] did
was to leave it up to the states to
make restrictions that will not
present an undue burden [on the
rightto abortion]. However, in
general, what may not be an

undue burden to an upper-
middle-class woman would be
an undue burden to poor women,
very young women, women who
live in rural areas and women of
color,” she said.

“When pro-abortionists say that
it is the poor and the young who
will suffer when abortions are
restricted, they are wallowing in
a sea of red herring. The rich are
always going to be privileged.
They will be able travel to New
York and other countries to have
their abortions. You and I are not
obligated to pay for the killing of
babies,” said Helen Cindrich,
director of People Concerned for
the Unborn Child.

Crisis pregnancy centers are
viewed by anti-abortion activists

as the preferred alternative to
abortion. In Western
Pennsylvania, there are 30 such
centers and a variety of low—cost
services for disadvantaged

mothers, including an Allegheny-

County program offering free
prenatal care for mothers under
17 years old.

“There are programs available
for young mothers, but what if
you’re 35?” asked Rosell. “What if
you just don’t want to continue
the pregnancy? Don’t you have
the right to say that ‘I don’t want
to be pregnant right now’?
Adoption is a viable option for
those who choose it. So is keeping
the baby to raise yourself. That's
what choice is. You make a
decision about [your pregnancy],

and you aren’t forced by anyone
else into an outcome.”

To Scott, adoption is the only
humane alternative and is the
greatest act of love that a birth
mother can perform. “To say that
carrying an unwanted child for
nine months is an unfair burden
is to denigrate the value of human
life. An unwanted pregnancy is
a mistake [to a pro-abortionist].
Thertziasy-away out is to have an
abortion-——— to ‘erase’ the mistake.”

Scott is opposed to abortion
and hopes that the decision will
result in debates that will educate
the public about the subject. “Let's
look at some of the assumptions
people have about abortion.

Once the public knows what -

abortion really involves, then they
will have a true choice.”

The Supreme Court and
the issue of abortion

The Supreme Court has spoken. After extensive delib-
erations, the Court has thrown the right to restrict the
funding and practice of abortion to the states. The states
now have the power to restrict or eliminate public funding
of abortions. They can require doctors to test fetuses for
viability, or the ability to survive outside of the womb, if
the pregnancy is more than 20 weeks advanced.

These steps are retroactive to the causes of women’s
rights and the right to control one’s own body. By
restricting public funding, the states can nail poor women
to the wall, forcing them to carry a pregnancy to term,
incurring all of the costs and investment of time involved
in pregnancy. Whether they can afford to take time off for
maternity leave (if they could get maternity leave) would
be completely irrelevant. Whatever the cost to her and her
life, a woman who could not afford an abortion from a
private doctor would be forced to carry to term, unless she
wished to turn to an unsafe, opportunistic “back-alley”
practitioner, risking mutilation or even death. The restric-
tion of public funding would only affect the poor, mak-

ing a life complicated by poverty even more difficult to ‘

survive and escape.

The logic in performing viability tests is also question-
able, since the fetus is still in the womb after 20 weeks,
even if it is viable. The fetus is still a part of the woman's
body. The pointlessness of this restriction is highlighted
when one considers that the vast majority of abortions are
performed earlier in the pregnancy anyway.

The right to the control of one’s own body has always
seemed inalienable. But this decision calls that right into
question. Neither a man nor a woman can be forced to
donate blood or an organ to a living child. Yet a woman
can now be forced to give her entire body for nine months
of her life to support a fetus.

The Webster vs. Reproductive Services decision marks
one of the rare instances of the Supreme Court limiting the
scope of a right that it had previously granted. We feel
anger at the decision and frustration with a court that has
become increasingly insensitive to the feelings of the
nation that it should be serving. justice Antonin Scalia
wrote in his opinion, “We can now look forward to 
streets full of demonstrators,_ urging us to follow the
popular will.” While the court exists to interpret the
Constitution, it cannot operate in a vacuum. The
Constitution was written for and by the will of the people,
and for the Court to uphold it, it must uphold the will of
the people. A Time magazine—CNN poll found that 61
percent of Americans disagree with the Court's decision,
and 57 percent oppose new laws to restrict abortions,
with only 31 percent favoring such restrictions.

The Court seems determined to disregard the American
people_in its crusade for conservatism. But the court exists
for us, and it is disturbing that a Supreme Court justice like
Scalia should have so little respect for what we, the

Dire predictions of things to come...

Headlines? News?

I never read the papers any-
more; I don't have to, because I
hear about important events in
advance.

You know, in the National
Examiner and Weekly World
News.

Unfortunately, the events cov-
ered are always national or inter-
national events, and as someone
recently pointed out to me, what
people around here most want to
know is what psychics are pre-
dicting for Pittsburgh.

Well, I dabble in the art myself.
Here is my short list of predic-
tions for the fall of 1989:

0 Sophie Masloffs mayoral cam-
paign will be rocked with a po-
litical scandal late in August. But
she will recover, launching the
most brilliant publicity campaign
in decades. Vowing to “reveal
all,” she will pose nude for either
Penthouse or Hustler and will

i subsequently win in a landslide.

0 Not to be outdone, Frank
Lucchino will also appear nude,
“just for the fun of it.”‘ But his
escapade will backfire when the
pictures reveal a small, green
tattoo that vaguely resembles a
frog. (1 see the tattoo on his lower
body, perhaps on his rear end.)
After the revealing photos are

stapled to every telephone pole
in the city by angry Tom Murphy
supporters, a teary-eyed Lucch-
ino will appear on Pittshurghis
Talking, and apologize, claiming
that he was brainwashed by a
satanic cult.

- It will be, revealed that Pitt
President Wesley Posvar is the
daughter of space aliens from
either Saturn or Jupiter. (I see
them now residing somewhere
in California.) Claiming “an im-
portant need to make contact

 

with extraterrestrial life and my
past,” Posvar will raise tuition to
fund a special Contact/research
project that will include calling
California to see if any space
aliens live there.

0 In a giant exposeby the Stu-
dent Government Board, it will
be revealed that the entire staff of
the Pitt News are midget Swahili
warriors without table manners,
and that the entire newspaper is
really written by three monkeys
on typewriters.

I also see several important
national events:

0 The political turmoil in China

will be revealed on Chinese TV. ' ‘

Deng Xiaoping will openly criti-

cize the party hard-liners, and-Li '
Peng will call for a “constitutional

settlement. ” A little known clause
in the Chinese Constitution calls
for a mandatory mud-wrestling

contest to resolve all political '

debates. I

0 It will be ‘revealed that the

Ayatollah is not really dead, but

has been touring with Elvis.

Khomeini has been secretly play- .

ing to sellout Muslim audiences
for about five years (this is‘ the
true secret of his popularity.) He
and Elvis will roll into Graceland

Dec. 17 playing “Terrorist Rock,” ,

a version of Elvis’s golden oldie.

0 George Bush will lose his

temper at a news ‘conference, to _

be held in early January. A nosy

reporter will ask him about that

“pesky homeless problem.” He
will respond terselyi “If they can’t
take a joke, screw. ‘em.”

Pentetrating the facade of the new Soviet Union

There is currently a resounding
craze sweeping the globe known
as Gorbymania. Gorbymania
made an impressive debut a few
weeks ago in front of a large West
German audience, which was
reverently chanting, “Gorbee!
Gorbee! Gorbee!!!" The sycophan-
tic response from the West Ger-
man people persisted even after
President Gorbachev contended
that there was no immediate need
to tear down the Berlin Wall, as
President Bush had previously
suggested. This type of hero-
worship of the Soviet leader
deserved? In other words: what is

‘Gorbachev really up to?

It has been insisted that Gor-
bachev’s attempts at glasnost and
perestroika have extended be-
yond the Soviet Union into the
global arena in order to eliminate
Soviet aggression and the Cold
War. But why a sudden change

tary days of Stalin, Kruschev,

the early days of Gorbachev

- regime?

‘ The reasons are varied. First of
all, the internal situation of the
Soviet Union is in utter turmoil.
The Soviet average life expec-
tancy is actually declining. Soviet
domestic technology is lacking in
that the Soviet Union has 1 5 times
fewer industrial computers than

advanced Western European
nations and only one for every 45
U.S. computers. According to the
Soviet Prime Minister, this year
the USSR would need $14 billion
of hard currency simply to fi-
nance its external hard currency
debt. Its rate of economic growth
is virtually nonexistent. But de-
spite these internal problems, the
Soviet Union has added more
tanks and artillery pieces since
Gorbachev came into power in
1985 than Great Britain, France
and West Germany combined.
They continue to provide over
$10 billion annually to the Marx-

 

ist governments of Cuba, Viet-
nam, Mozambique and Nicara-
gua. And according to former
Assistant Secretary of State Rich-
ard Perle, Soviet military produc-
tion has increased to the point
where it has made up for weap-
ons lost through the INF treaty.
Also, despite the admiration of
many Gorbymaniacs, the Soviet
Union’s recent proposals toward
global disarmament have been
neither proportional nor admi-

rable. Gorbachev did not enter, a

WHO CARES WI-IY?!?!?!?!!!? IT
WORKS DOESN’T'I’I? Apparently,
someone has failed to explain to
you one of the most basic “Orien-
tal secrets.” If it works, don’t ask
any questions.

Why bother with “quarks” and
“gluons?” IT WORKS.

Obviously, you must make
some serious decisions in your
life. Confucius once said, “A wise
man will not carry a broadsword
and a slide rule at the same time.”

You cannot pursue your woman- _

ish study of books and hope to
follow in the traditions of the
Mongol warrior at the same time.
If you have any brains at all, you
will get right out of your pusil-
lanimous Duluthschool, and go
loot and pillage.

Of course, I don’t know why
I’m bothering to write all this
since all you physicists under-
stand are equations. So here’s an
equation for you buddy -

WIMP+BOOKS=PHYSICIST=YOU

YOU+BROADSWORD+RUI'HLESS
DRIVE=REAL MAN

Calculate that!’

Gbengis Khan is a 13th cen- ’

tury Mongol conquemr and
moonligbts as an advice colum-

the astonishing and unexpected
proposal by President Bush for
conventional force parity, which
he has since praised. Instead he
was aiming for a highly asym-
metrical reduction in short—range
missiles (which the Soviets are
still demanding) that would only
benefit the Warsaw Pact, not the
NATO alliance.

Just last week, Gorbachev
denounced President Bush’s
suggestion that the Soviets pull
their troops from Poland, calling
the proposal “propaganda.”

The citizens of the Soviet Un-
ion’s Eastern Bloc allies have dealt
serious blows to Marxist doctrine
at the voting booths in Poland
and in demands for democratic
reform in other eastern bloc’
countries. This not only hurts the
Soviet Union, in that it’s an
embarrassment to it as the role
model for Marxist nations, but it
may leave the USSR without any
eastern bloc comrades. Hence, a
wise Gorbachev extends an olive
branch beyond the East — justi-
fying his actions as an example of
Soviet willingness for peaceful
change, a sort of global version
of glasnost. .

But if the Soviet Union has _lost
any hard-line support in Eastern
Europe, it has gained crucial al-
lies in the oil—rich areas of the
Mediterranean and the Persian

Gulf. It has accomplished this by
deals such as the sale of nine
Soviet MIG 23s to Libya (the
Libyan pilots will be trained in
the Soviet Union) and by reach-
ing an agreement with Iran for
military dealings just a few weeks
ago.

But what about the free elec-
tions and the incorporation of
such prominent political maver-
icks as Boris Yeltsin (who won
by a large majority) and Andre
Sakharov, into the Soviet system?
Well, free electionsarea sign of
glasnost. But these two men were
denied seats in the new Supreme
Soviet, only to have that denial
rescinded after highly publicized
protests by the Western world
and Soviet citizens. ._

Many argue that a peace-seek-
ing Gorbachev pulled Soviet
troops out of Afghanistan. How-
ever, the number of Soviet weap-
ons and troops in Afghanistan
escalated from the time of Gor-
bachev’s emergence in 1985 until
the withdrawal in 1989. In actual-
ity, it wasn’t Gorbachev’s innate

_ kindness that prompted the So-

viet withdrawal, but U.S.-aided
Stinger missiles. Furthermore,
according to Pakistan Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto, the Soviet
Union iscurrently air-lifting sup-
plies to its puppet regime in
Afghanistan. The Soviet presence

is still strong in Afghanistan.
It's somewhat perplexing that
the Soviet economy and internal
politics are in a shambles, yet
their weapons production has
increased. This all prompts me to
ponder a.f_ew questions: Why, if
a country is already militarily
superior in nuclear and conven-
tional forces, would one put more
money toward them, while the
economy is a disaster? Could this,
be an indication that the Cold
War is not in fact over, but is
instead creeping to our doorstep
in the guise of a man named
Gorbachev, armedwith redolent
yet ostentatious neo-Soviet ide-
ologies such as glasnost and
perestroika? Could Gorbachev’s
hopes of U.S.-Soviet detente and
friendly relations with economi-
cally prosperous NATO allies such
as West Germany be an easy
route to the technology and
prosperity of the West? The an-
swers to these questions are not
yet certain, but one thing is: If the
Cold War is not coming to an
end, and Gorbachev is actually a

sly and domineering leader from  ’_ ~.

sion, it would be wise to con- ,

They don’t come any hotter

Released several weeks ago,
Spike Lee’s new ﬁlm about

racism takes place on the hottest
day of the year. And because of

 i_ts.s.cenes.ofinterr.acial violence, .

Do the Right Thing has sparked
the most heated controversy
surrounding a film this year.
Many critics fear audiences

By Chris Bosak
Contributing Editor

When Pittsburgh’s Eviction was
just getting started about two
years ago, they were having a
hard timecoming up with a name

- for their group.

, But when the police broke up
a practice session at drummer
Ron Reidell’s house and.
threatened to evict his family, the
name seemed ﬁtting.

Lately, local success for the
thrash-metal, hard—core band has
come naturally. They recently
released their second demo tape,
Who Will Win?, and they have
been playing with some of the
best hard—core and thrash—metal
bands around.

, Included in that list are Nuclear

. Assault, Broken Bones, Exploited,

Death, Overkill and Manowar.
Eviction’s Rob Tabachka
describes the band’s playing style
as “metal core.”
“We play the styles of heavy

_metal, but a little faster, with the

attitude and speed of hard core,”
says Tabachka.

With Reidell on drums,
Tabachka and Scott Greg on

ambivalence of real people.
Lee complains: “The white
critics identify with Sal, but the
movie's not about him." Of
course, _Lee is right — his white
critics with Sal. But
part of the power of the ﬁlm is
that it doesn’t provide any easy
identiﬁcations for audiences (or
critics). A
. When watching the movie
with an interracial audience,
you realize that people around
you are responding in different
ways. Who you are inﬂuences
who you identify with in the
movie. It’s stupid to say that
regardless of race, we’re all
really the same. This becomes
evident during a jam-packed
showing of Do TheRight Thing.
Ending racism is about

‘accepting one’s own identity

and accepting other people's
identities and knowing they
differ, not saying that we’re all
one big family. The ﬁlm
challenges us to go beyond
easy identiﬁcations and see the .
bigger‘ picture. " D

the pizzeria burned. Then they

really like The Who, but we’re
not putting them down just be-
cause we’re having a little fun
with the song.”

One thing the members of

Eviction want to avoid is being’

stereotyped and identified with
satanic music just because they
play heavy metal music.

“We try to stay away from the
devil. We get labeled as that all
the time, but it’s stupid. We're not
into that at all,” says Porter. —

Another thing Eviction isn’t into
are the charges of racism that
were a big issue in Pittsburgh last
spring. People thought the club
they usually play at, the Electric
Banana, was a racist skinhead
hangout.

“The type of crowd we have
isn’t like a racist, skinhead Nazi-
type following because we’re not
labeled as that kind of band. We
don't preach that type of thing in
our lyrics,” says T abachka. '

Porter added that a different
kind of skinhead crowd often
comes to their shows.

“The skinheads that we know
and come see us are called SHARP
skinheads, or SkinHeads Against
Racial Prejudice. They’re really
cool; they’re against all that racist
bullshit,” says Porter.

Eviction enjoys playing in the
Pittsburgh area but admitted it’s a
little difficult with only two clubs
that have shows regularly, the
Electric Banana and The Sonic
Temple. Eviction hasn’t played at
The Sonic Temple yet, but soon
will.

Porter said that recording in
the studio is fun, but it doesn’t
even compare to the feeling of
playing a live show. .

“I love total chaos when we're
playing. I love it when everyone
is stagediving and moshing and
slamming. It sounds corny, but
we do feed off the energy that

Eviction’s main goals as a band
are to make a good product for
the public and to get a decent
record company to back them
up. Eviction has had contract
offers from various companies,
including Alcame, New
Renaissance, and Metal Blade,
but hasn’t signed any yet.

“We want to see more contracts
and compare to see who gives us
the best offer. Then we’ll make
our move from there,”
Tabachka.

“Living In Emptiness,” the first
song on Who Will ‘Wmf, will
appear on Complete Def Volume
3, a compilation record put out
by Metal Blade.

Eviction’s next show will be on
July 30 at the Electric Banana.
They will play along with Mucky

THE PITT NEWS

Matthews home after tourney

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

Colorado Springs, Colo. —
USA Basketball is geared up
after the Confederation of Pan
Am Basketball Associations
World Qualification Tourna-
ment in Mexico City held from
June 8-18, and Pitt’s Jason
Matthews proved to be the
team’s premier three—point
shooting ace.

Matthews played in all eight
games in the Mexico City tour-
nament and was 12-22 from
three—point range and 15-33
from the field with 10 rebounds,
one steal, one assist and one
blocked shot. Overall, he aver-
aged 6.4 points per game and
had the highest three—point
percentage of anyone on the
team with a .545 mark. He also
missed only one of his 10 free
throws.

Since Matthews helped Pitt

"to beat some of the best teams
in college basketball last sea-

‘son, he felt he had a good
chance to make the U.S. Na-
tional Team.

“I thought I had a pretty good
year last year, and I filled out
my application; when the re-
sults came back, [USA,Basket-
ball] had me on their list,” said
Matthews;‘_“They called Coach
[Paul] Evans and told him that
they wanted me to come and
try out for the team.”

The selection process for the
USA Basketball team is some-
what confusing. Matthews’
application process will be il-
lustrated for clarity. '

- Matthews submitted an ap-
plication to the Games Com-
mittee of USA Basketball which
in turn submitted his applica-

. tion to a player selection sub-
committee. The sub-committee
"selected 21 players and invited
them to try out for the team.
This year only 15 showed up to
try out, and a couple others left
because of injury or summer
school.

USA Basketball has earned
the right to play in the World
Championships by being one
of the top four teams to emerge
from the tournament in Mexico

‘City.

After playing in what is ar-
guably the toughest conference
in college basketball and com-
peting against the same players

point percentage.
son, Matthews is experiencing

a different look at basketball
by way of international rules.

“When you play internation-
ally, the game is a lot different.
Everybody here is basically the
best player on their team or the
top scorer," said Matthews.
“Playing in this type of atmos-
phere, you really have to play
team ball. I’m not going to get

all the shots I got at Pitt; the
same goes for everybody else
here. So you just try to fit in
and do what the coaches want
—-— good defense, rebounding,
moving the ball around and
taking the open shot.”

Last season, Matthews set a
new ‘Big-East single-season
record for three-point field goal

team that will compete in the
1989 Summer World University
Games in Duisberg, West Ger-
many, Aug. 25-28.

This is not the first time Moore

“Bad weather earlier in the

recorded this season,” said
Vasvary. “However, good weather
at the end of the season has made
[Moore’s] times better.”

Vasvary also expressed his pride
in Moore. “It is quite an honor for
the university and the Pitt track
program to have Dave represent

Moore. “I’m World Univer-  

happy to qualify for the World
Games, and I’m going to try to do
my best.”

Moore, a junior from Phi1adel- '
’ phia, earned his bid to the team

after finishing second among
college competitors in the 800-
meter run at the Mobil Outdoor
Track and Field Championships,

held last month in Houston, Texas. ’

Pitt will not release Chalenski

. percentage (.522 36-69). He was

also ranked first in the Big East in
overall three—point goal percent-
age with a ﬁgure of .492 68-1 18).
His 61 treys last season set a Pitt
record for field goals made.

International distance for the
th.ree-point line is 21 feet as
opposed to the college 19 feet, 9
inches. Matthews is indifferent to
the new distance.

“For me, it's not really a big dif-
ference. I don’t really pay any
attention to it. I think some of the
shots I took last season measured
a good 21 feet,” said Matthews.

International rules also call for
a 50—second clock, giving all the
U.S. college players less time to
set up their offense. Matthews is
an advocate of the 30—second
clock.

“I like the 50—second clock. For
the college game, I think 45 sec-
onds is good. But for interna-
tional when it’s up and down and
the ref doesn’t have to touch the
ball on a turnover, you can just
get right on the sidelines and
push the ball up. It's a lot faster
paced game, so you need the 30-
second clock to keep the game

going at a run-and—gun pace,”

said Matthews.
Chris Corchiani, one of USA

~ Basketball’s premier guards out

of North Carolina State, is also an
advocate of the 30—second clock.

“You do what every player likes
to do, and that's running up and
‘down the court," said Corchiani.
“College ‘ball is more pass-and-
cut and patience, and interna-

' tional ball is more like whoever “ " '

has the better athletes that can
tolerate racing up and down the
court will win.”

Corchiani, at only 6 foot, is the
team’s main intimidator with his
aggressive, even brutal, style of
play, an ironic situation when he
is on the floor with such giants as
Syracuse's Billy Owens and
Duke's Christian Laettner. Dur-
ing only one game, Corchiani
was involved in six major scufﬂes.

“That's the way I’ve played my
whole life," Corchiani said. “A lot
of times when you’re small, other
players will try to intimidate you,
and I just don’t let that happen.”

Panther Notes:
Where other Pitt Panthers
are playing this summer:

Brian Shorter, who

averaged 19_.6 points and
9.6 rebounds per game last
-season, has been invited to
try out for the United States

pic Festival. They will play
July 28-29 in Oklahoma City,
Okla.

Dare1le.Porter averaged
9.2 points per game for the
"Big East All-Star team that
