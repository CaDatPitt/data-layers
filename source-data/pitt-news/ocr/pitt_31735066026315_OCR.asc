Board reconsiclers 81 requests originally denied by the allocations committee

Zachariah Blott

Managing Edltor

Susan Gillis Kruman stood before
the nine Student Government Board
members and explained that the
Dance Ensemble’s electrical cables
are so old and worn, an electrical
inspector threw them out this past
year.

As the group’s adviser described
the equipment, some of which has
been in use for 30 years, a few SGB
members opened their mouths and

eyes in apparent amazement that the_
lights and cables still worked.

The SGB heard much testimony
like Gillis Kruman’s Tuesday night, as
members of 21 student groups
appealed the Allocations Committee’s
recommendations to the board. These
recommendations concerned how
much money each organization would
receivefor the 1998-99 ﬁscal year.

“We try to follow their
[Allocations Committee’s] recom-
mendations,” said SGB President
Alyson Wallach, “but because we

  
 
 
    
 

have an opportunity to listen to exten-
uating circumstances, we can deny
those [recommendations].”

And the SGB was definitely
receptive to what the many groups
said about the funding recommenda-
tions made by the Allocations
Committee last week for more than
100 organizations. Of the 81 appeals
presented by groups, the SGB voted to
reconsider 40 of the committee's sug-
gestions.

It should be noted that all the rec-
ommendations addressed were denials

or deferrals. SGB’s denial of a com-
mittee’s suggestion means the money
in question will be evaluated by the
committee at another time, and its new
recommendation will later be present-
ed to the board for another vote.

Wallach pointed out that no ofﬁ-
cial decisions were made on Tuesday;
rather, the board voted for the com-
mittee to reconsider 40 of the 81
appeals. The 41 denials that the SGB
did not vote against will stand as
denied.

Female physicians at the
University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center say they haven’t encountered
any episodes of gender discrimination
or sexual harassment, which over
physicians
nationwide have reported experienc-
ing.

“The work environment at
UPMC is fabulous,” said UPMC
pathologist Dr. Lydia Contis.

A nationwide poll, the first of this
magnitude to study the harassment of

workplace,” said Nieland—Fisher.
Researchers led by Dr. Erica
Frank of Emory University found that
younger female doctors reported
higher rates of sexual harassment
than older physicians. The survey
also found substantial amounts of
harassment occurring at medical
schools: 31 percent of those surveyed
struggled with gender harassment,
and 20 percent coped with sexual
harassment while at medical school.
“I never really ran into any sexu-
al or gender bias. I feel lucky and sur-
prised that I never encountered any
kind of discrimination,” said UPMC’s

a February 1998 article in the J°""‘"EBROWN/G’*A”“’C5A55’5’A"” harassment

Archives of Internal Medicine.

Sexual harassment is defined as
any unwelcome verbal or physical
sexual advance, a request for sexual
favors, or threats of repercussions for
not submitting to sexual advances.
Gender harassment has been defined
as any act that discriminates against a
person’s sex.

Since the 1993-94 survey never
specified what acts count as harass-
ment, the doctors surveyed relayed
what they thought fell under the cate-
gory of harassment.

“I’ve never run into any kind of
bias or harassment. In fact, I’ve only
had the utmost deference shown
towards me,” said Dr. Nancy Nieland-
Fisher, a dermatologist who has prac-
ticed at UPMC for 20 years.

Nieland—Fisher said the high inci-
dences reported by the poll surprised
her because she doesn’t have first-
hand knowledge of anyone ever being
harassed. She said the poll may have
been aimed at women known to have
suffered gender or sexual harassment.

“As far as I know, my colleagues
haven’t experienced any bias in the

problems, mainly because these fields
tend to have a higher percentage of
male employees.

McBride used to be a chemical
engineer and came to UPMC in 1989
after completing her medical residen-
ey. She recalls, when a chemical engi-
neer, being the only women working
on a site with about 40 men and not
really experiencing anything that she
would consider harassment.

Since each case of harassment is
unique, it can be difficult to define
some instances as harassment. The
researchers who conducted the poll
said sexual harassment stems from a
need to dominate another person,
rather then any real feelings of sexual
attraction.

Prior surveys have revealed a
great number of the harassment cases
against female physicians to be com-
mitted by patients» instead of col-
leagues.

The poll based its findings on
4,501 women ages 30 to 70. These
part-time, full—time or retired doctors
went to medical school and graduated
between 1950 and 1989.

Town Hall meeting as board member Damon Hudac presides over the event.

More ministations likely, police
chief says at Town Hall meeting

James Maude
Staff Writer

Pitt police ministations on the
upper and lower campuses and a bon-
fire before next year’s football game
against Penn State were the major
points discussed at last night’s SGB—
sponsored town hall meeting.

Though the town hall meeting,
held in the Assembly Room of the
William Pitt Union, was poorly
attended, students asked Pitt Police
Chief ~ Deborah Furka and Pitt
Program Council Director Tom
Misuraca a lot of pertinent questions.

Issues raised during the meeting
included establishing University
police ministations on upper and
middle campuses, placing police call-
boxes in isolated areas, the PPC’s
policy regarding movies for students,
and the PPC’s upcoming events.

Furka said she supported placing
ministations on the upper and middle
campuses because, “The philosophy
I’m trying to develop within the
department is that we’re community
committed. Ministations put our peo—
ple out there and make us more visi-
ble.”

As for placing police phones on
campus, Furka said there have been
discussions about putting more
phones on campus, though specific
locations have not been considered.
Students did, however, suggest the
Cathedral lawn and the pathway
behind Old Engineering Hall as
places in need of them.

One student expressed, his dis-

taste for arriving back at the Towers
on a weekend to find Pitt police wait-
ing in the lobby looking specifically
for drunken students.

Furka responded by saying, “Our
policy is one of zero tolerance for
alcohol and drug offenses. 'We have
been asked by residents to have a
heavy police presence in that area.”

Furka also fielded questions on
graffiti, campus—po1ice jurisdiction,
panhandlers, smoking in dorms, and
the availability of crime statistics to
the public.

Misuraca fielded questions on
PPC events, and policy concerning
showing on—campus films.

Misuraca said traditional student
events such as Homecoming festivi-
ties, the bonfire two days before the
Penn State game, a wine—tasting sem-
inar and next year’s spring break trip
are planned for next year.

He also said that the PPC, in con-
junction with the athletics depart-
ment, is hoping to bring some popu-
lar bands and concerts to the
Fitzgerald Field House.

The athletics department will
allow the PPC to hold two shows, one
per semester, according to Misuraca.

Misuraca said the strength of the

PPC comes from the number of peo— '

ple involved. Students join a PPC
committee and express their opinions
on who should come to speak or what
activities should be held, he said.

“The more people on our com-
mittee,” Misuraca noted, “the more
representation there is from the stu-
dent body.”

With ﬁnal exams fast approaching, some stu-
dents have taken matters into their own hands, says
a prominent faculty member who did‘ not wish to be
identiﬁed.

“It seems students are copying“ their notes to
give to each other———a stupendous way to study to-
gether!” he said

“Some never learn,” another faculty member
added, “How much time and ink will they waste
hand-copying? It just isn't right.” .

Eddie Thlearn, a Pitt senior, said, “The coolest
place on campus to get notes copied is the Copy

APPEALS

The reasons for denial were out-
lined by Allocations Committee Chair
Chris Boback. Group representatives
then presented their appeals and were
given two minutes to rebut the reason-
ing ofthe denial. Some groups were
forced to discuss funding priorities
among themselves on
the spot when faced
with having to decide
which events were
most important to get
money for.

“The idea is to
share our culture with
all cultures,” said
BAS member
Markques McKnight
about Unity Day, an
event his group
wished to receive
money for and that
required an appeal.

“Do you feel this
is a higher priority
than any other pro-
gram, though?” asked
SGB member Marc
Murphy in reply.

Because of Murphy’s question,
the approximately 15 BAS members
present had a short discussion to rank
their funding needs.

By the time 21 appeals were heard
and five and one—half hours had

passed since the meeting’s 8 p.m.
start, the SGB and studentorganiza—
tions alike were glad the process was
over. Both sides said they felt the time
had been productive, though.

“It’s very important that the board

has the opportunity to hear appeals ‘

firsthand from the
organization,”
said » Wallach.
“There weren’t
any outrageous
appeals, except
for the hockey
club.”

The hockey
club asked for
$20,000 for ice
rink rental fees.
The Dance
Ensemble, on the
other hand, made
a request that the
board found more
reasonable. If
walked away
with successful
appeals for some
new equipment, guest teachers and a
field_ trip.

“They were very understanding to
our requests,” said Dance Ensemble
board member Jami Kroh. “I thought
she [Wallach] handled the situation
well.”

Across the Nation

LAKE HAVASU CITY, Ariz. —
Despite extensive searches, the body of a
Pennsylvania youth remains lost some-
where in Arizona’s Lake Havasu.

Eighteen—year-old Phillip Anthony
Longo, a student at Arizona State
University, was among thousands of col-
lege students from across the country
who traveled to Lake Havasu for spring
break. .

On March 21, Longo and eight other
students rented a 20-foot aluminum pon-
toon boat, purchased alcohol, and headed
for Copper Canyon, a popular party spot.
As they returned at about 7:30 p.m.,
Longo lost his balance and fell from the
bow of the boat in Thompson Bay.

Police cited six of the students for
underage drinking and are waiting for the
results of a test given to the boat’s opera-
tor. .

Despite an extensive search involv-
ing helicopters, planes, boats, sonar
equipment, underwater cameras, divers,
scent dogs and dozens of volunteers, the
body of the Yardley teenager has yet to
be found.

Lt. Randy Johnson of the Mohave
County Sheriff ’s Office says, “The water
is unforgiving.”

Eigh teen-year-old still missing

HOUSTON, Texas — Tests of a blood
substitute in American emergency
rooms have stopped because more
patients than expected were dying.

A spokesman for an Illinois health
care company says a review of the ﬁrst
100 people treated with the artificial
blood showed that they died at a
greater rate than those who didn’t
receive it.

Tests will continue with elective
surgery patients.

READING, Pa. — You find warning
labels on cigarettes and fast-food cof-
fee cups.

And maybe, someday, on mar-
riages in Pennsylvania.

State lawmaker Charles Dent is
looking for a way to fight domestic_
violence, and he’s hit upon the idea of
attaching a warning to marriage licens-
es. His proposed statement reads:

“The laws of this Commonwealth
affirm your right to enter this marriage,
and at the same time to live within the
marriage free of violence and abuse.”

The statement goes on to say that
physical abuse, sexual abuse and
assault of a spouse are against the law.

The bill goes to a state House com-
mittee for review.

Sex and integrity:
Do they matter?

While discussing the content for this editorial last
night, one member of The Pitt News staff brought up the
question of whether people would have been more like-
ly to have wonied about a presidential candidate’s
integrity two years ago, before the country re-elected Bill
Clinton, if they knew then what they know now.

Two years ago, the American public had heard of '

Paula Jones and Gennifer Flowers, but these seemed to
be old stories, far removed from Clinton's past, and there
was very little evidence that Clinton had done anything
wrong. There were only allegations —— a fact a judge
acknowledged yesterday when she threw the Paula
Jones case out of court.

V But the Jones case opened up a big can of worms
because the investigation carried out for it led to evi-
dence of more recent illicit affairs Clinton is alleged to
have had. Recent White House stall-and-evade tactics
seem to suggest that Clinton might indeed have some-
thing to hide.

If this had happened during Clinton's ﬁrst term,
would the American public have re-elected him?

Far be it from us to be prophets or soothsayers or to
pretend to know that answer. It may very well be that the
nation would have felt ﬂiat this whole affair (pardon the
pun) is unimportant to a president's duties. If current
presidential approval ratings mean anything, that seems
quite likely.

But there is reason to believe that they might have
considered ﬂie issue of integrity a bit more had it been
thrown in their faces before making a decision. Right
now, the citizens might realize that there is nothing they
can do, so they just accept that fact and try to be happy
with it. But would people have been so accepting if they
knew they could make a diﬁerence, if they thought the
president was a shady character while they stood in line
at the polls?

We don’t know the answer. But we do know that,
above all else, information is a scarce and valuable com-
modity. The more the public knows, the greater is the

likelihoodthatitwillmakeadecisionitwillbetruly‘

happy with after the fact

Now, we don’t want to sound like Richard Mellon
Scaife here, but we believe that Paula Jones did a very
important thing when she came forward with her sexual
harassment suit

Jones paved the way for more information to come
out She brought issues to the public’s attention that may
have an impact on the way we View our leaders, and the
decisions we make in choosing them.

Fallout fun from April Fools’ Day E

Kevin
Carey
Where does April Fools’ Day

come from? There are a number of

different stories behind the origins of
the April Fools‘ Day. The common
belief is that it is the product of spring
equinox parties. Apparently, at the
change of the equinox, people felt the
need to party. Spring fever, I suppose.
(Isn't it great the way society always
tries to substantiate a cause for party-
ing?) .

It is thought that the ﬁrst April
Fools‘ Day originated in France. The
starting octave commenced on March
25 and ended on April 1 (circa. 1564),
giving birth to what today is the crazi-
est day of the year. The post-spring
equinox party is more or less equiva-
lent to partying your dad's plaid party
socks off after ﬁnals week Yesterday,
the spring fever and madness that
come with April Fools’ Day perrneat-
ed into the walls of The Pitt News
(either that, or we've got a really bad
gas leak on our hands). The Pitt News,
I'm proud to say, published a ﬁne
batch of homegrown April foolish-
ness.
Since I missed the debut of the
"Weekly World Insider Globe Pitt
Sun News Enquirer" yesterday, I ﬁg-
ured I'd extend the boundary of April
Fools’ Day another 24 hours. The way
I see things, the task of fooling a per-
son on April Fools‘ Day is just entire-
ly too diﬂicult. Think about it for a
second: It is an advertised day, and the
chance of pulling off the old line,
"Mom, the dog had a heart attack and
is dead," just might not be too funny.

In lieu of understanding that
April Fools’ Day is a diﬂicult day on
which to achieve the ultimate tom-
foolery (without giving someone a

are April Fools‘ Day punches that

(The thing that irritates me most
about that damn broken clock is that it

weeks now. I never realized that
installing a new battery required so
much long—terrn planning. Plus, on
top of the fact that the clock is "out of
order," as the white loose-leaf note
states, I'm sure any college student
would be able to determine that the
clock wasn't working if he looked at it

think about it. Every day of life is an
April Fools‘ Day, and the intention of
it to be is never present.

The real responsibility for April
Fools‘ Day has to fall into the hands of
all those witty engineers, mathemati-

face it, those three groups make up a
large percentage of the good ol' fash-

for. The only thing that I could think
of that would make April Fools‘ Day
more enjoyable would be to add an

won't lose your job, it's April 1:
Everything goes.

Point /COUNTERPOINT

New regs unsubstantiated

Michael Berquist

columnist

This past summer, _the
Environmental Protection Agency pro-
posed a series of new clean air regula-
tions. The EPAhas decreed that industry
is to eliminate all particulate-matter pol-
lution down to 2.5 microns. (To give you
an idea of how small these particles are,
one_couldﬁt28 ofthemacrossthewidth
of a strand of hair.) I believe these regula-
tions are a tragic mistake. .

I consider myself an environmental-

‘ ist. I support the EPA's goal of making

our air cleaner to breathe because I think
there is clear proof that the beneﬁts of
these regulations cleariy outweigh the
drawbacks. For example, thanks to legis-
lationlike the C1eanAirAct of l970—a
shining success of the environmental
movement and one of the rare pieces of
legislation in American history with very
obvious beneﬁts —- the United States has
become a vastly cleaner and healthier
place to live.

any-

To begin with, most analysts agree
that the new EPA regulations are wholly

The agency itself has estimated that
the regulations will cost the public some-
where between $6.5 billion and $8.5 bil-
lion, and that all of those costs will be
made up by the improvements in public
health However, some reports estimate
that the true cost will range somewhere
between $90 billion and $150 billion, and
result in the loss of over 200,000 jobs. In
states like Pennsylvania and Ohio alone,
the job losses could be as high as 10,000.
Most groups estimate that the real per

Such a large cost will have a profoundly
negative elfect on the economy.

Another complaint that I have is the
lack of a scientiﬁc basis for these new
standards. The EPA's Clean Air Science
Advisory Committee. has come to the
conclusion that the agency cannot "pro-
vide a scientiﬁcally adequate basis" for
proposing the new PM standards.

ciently to prevent about, 15,000 premature
deaths per year, mainly among the elderly, the
very young, and those with pre-existing respi-
ratory problems.

The particulate-matter (or PM to those hep
to the lingo) regulations deal with very small
particles. It seems counterintuitive at ﬁrst, but
ﬁne particles — less than 2.5 micrometers in
diameter—— can be more dangerous than larger
ones because they can very easily get sucked
deeply into the lungs. Studies show that this
aggravates asthma (no, nobody's claiming that
PMcausesthe_diseaseitselt)andcausesall
sorts of ﬁm respiratory problems like decreased
lung ﬁmction and chronic bronchitis. Of
course, this means more and earlier deaths. It

- also means more emergency room and hospital

visits, as well as more missed workdays.
This brings me to my next point, which is

  
   
  

    
    

that we simply can't afford air pollution at its
current levels. The concentration of ozone, for
instance, costs the United States $500,000,000
annually in crop losses. Add in other costs, like
reduced productivity, and it shouldn't be terribly
surprising that the EPA's cost-beneﬁt analysis
showed that enacting the regulations would
yield a net savings.

Moreover, these are very ﬂexible stan-

dards, designed not to be too harsh on states.

that are making a good-faith effort to reduce
pollution. This gets really complicated, but
here's the short version. The EPA will complete
its data for each region to determine what areas
are and aren't in compliance. (Some areas will
be completely unalfected by the new regs, as
their air is just tickety-boo already.) Areas with
air quality problems then get three years to
come up with plans for how to meet the new
standards. These plans will be reviewed over
18 months. Actual compliance can take place
over several more years. .
Pollution that comes from downwind is
also taken into account through the regionally
based approach, which uses a cap-and-trade
program. (Every area gets a pollution

  
  
    
     

   
   
 
   
 

    

  

moral uprightness!

Maybe because air pollution is largely
invisible, these regulations have been targeted
by ﬂiose who can pretend that it's only a myth,
along with gravity and JD. Salinger. Led by an
unholy alliance of Gov.rTom Ridge and Rep.
Ron.Klink, a PR machine has attempted to

amt

     

talk about clean air, good
to have both." (I guess he's
opin Air Fairy will come.)

"Other states are sending us their dirty air, and
we can't meet the standards if we start in the
red," said Ridge at a recent canned political
rally.

The EPA's regional administrator, W.
Michael McCabe, responded eloquently.
"What are they talking about‘? We worked with
37 OTAG [Ozone Transport Assessment
Group] states to level the playing ﬁeld Then
we issued SIP [state implementation plan] calls

Say Aloha to a

Christmas Day
doubleheader

College football is up to its old
tricks again.

Last year, when the suits behind the
game decided it was time for the Rose
Bowl, the granddaddy of them all, to
have major corporate sponsorship,
there were some raised eyebrows.

Why tarnish the image of one of
the greatest sports spectacles with
tacky billboards, repetitive commer-
cials and a halftime show with every-
thing from dancing bears to washed—up
bands like Alabama?

Why not?

Money is powerful, especially in
college athletics, and no one in his right
mind would turn down a multimillion-
dollar payout just to play a postseason
game.

Thank God for Lenny Klompus.

Klompus, the CEO for Bowl
Games of Hawaii, has issued a propos-
al to the NCAA Bowl Committee that
would bring yet another bowl to the
winterslew ,of games that includes but
is not limited to:

The Tostitos Fiesta, Nokia Sugar,
FedEx Orange, Chic—fil-A Peach,
Builder’s Square Alamo, Ford Motor
City, Insight.com, Northwest Sun,
Southwestern Bell Cotton, Outback,
Carquest, Humanitarian, Liberty and
my personal favorite, the Poulan Weed
Eater Independence Bowl in
Shreveport, La. .

Less than ﬁve years after Klompus’
“Championship in Paradise” bid, which
would have brought the national cham-
pionship game to Hawaii, was rejected
in favor of the less-than-spectacular
Bowl Alliance, he’s back.

This time Klompus is vying for the
rights to establish the games’ first-ever
bowl doubleheader.

On Christmas Day, no less.

The Mele Kalikimaka Classic
would immediately follow the 17th
Annual Jeep Aloha Bowl and would pit
the No.—5 team from the Pac 10 against
the second-ranked team from the WAC.

The Aloha Bowl presently pits the
Pac 10’s No.—4 team against the top
team from the WAC. -

All four teams would each receive
a payout of nearly $750,000.

Is this really necessary?

It is if you are ESPN, or if you’re
affiliated with the No. 4 team from the
Pac 10 or the WAC runner—up.

Six-run filth leads to West Vir inia win
Panther pitcher John Schultz shelled in his third ass of season

Kevin Lilley

Sports Edltor

For the first four
innings, the Pitt baseball
team was cruising.

Up 5-3 and coming off
an 11-run victory the day
before, the offense seemed
in gear. After a rocky second
inning, Panther hurler John
Schultz had settled down,
shutting out the West
Virginia Mountaineers
through the third and fourth
frames.

But in the bottom of the
fifth, the team stopped
cruising. Schultz was tagged
for three runs without retir-
ing a batter and watched
from the bench as WVU pol-
ished off a six-run inning on
the way to a 10-7 victory

season, struck out just two
batters in four innings but kept the
Mountaineers in check until the
fifth by stranding runners. WVU
left 14 batsmen on base in the con-
test, compared to Pitt’s seven.

The Mountaineers overcame the
14 stranded runners with 19 hits on
the evening, including a 4-for-4
performance from shortstop Jamie

'Hammond, who scored two runs

and drove in another. Hammond
also stole two bases, bringing his
total to nine on the season.

While no Panther could match
Hammond’s individual output, sec-
ond baseman Harry Ciavarella came
closest, going 2-3 with two RBIs.
He also scored a run but didn’t steal

any bases —— the entire Pitt team
was shut out on the basepaths,
with Chris Delsignore and
Kevin Foley thrown out on the
team’s only two attempts.

The loss drops Pitt’s record to
6-11, 1-5 in the Big East.
Conference foe West Virginia,
winner of the Big East American
Division last season, improves
to 3-1 in the and 16-6-1 overall.
The loss comes the night after
Pitt demolished cross—town rival
Duquesne at Trees Field, 15-6.
Instead of stranding runners as
did WVU, the Dukes lost out on
potential runs by using up their
power too early, blasting four
inning-opening homers in the
contest.

Duquesne played close with the
Panthers until the seventh, when
Pitt scored five runs, two com-
ing off of a Bill Brown single.
Panther left fielder Jason Oliver
added an RBI double in the
eighth, part of a four-run rally
that cemented the win.

Pitt’s next action comes this
weekend, with a doubleheader set
for Saturday at Trees Field versus
the St. J ohn’s Red Storm. Game one
begins at noon.

the stories of these athletes
are compelling.

Two are grizzled veterans who, as a
last hurrah in their decorated wrestling
careers, earned All—America honors for the
third time. The other is a skilled freshman
who is just getting warmed up.

John Withrow

John Withrow had a blast in each one
of his 128 wins during his ﬁve years as a
Pitt wrestler. The guys who lost those 128
matches didn’t have quite as much fun
getting beaten, twisted and pummeled, but
Withrow enjoyed every second of his
involvement in the sport of wrestling.

“From the time I started, I’ve always
had fun wrestling,” Withrow explained. “I
think a lot of guys at the college level
make sports too much like a job, but I had
fun with it.

“I was always the one screwing
around before the matches. Back in the
locker room, guys would be real tense, and
I’d be kicking balls around and keeping
things loose. I stayed relaxed and never
really worried about things too much.”

Withrow’s competitive wrestling
career came to a close two weeks ago, as
the 177-pounder ﬁnished third in the

nation, the highest of any Pitt grappler.

since Pat Santoro’s national championship
in 1989. That ﬁnish made Vﬁthrow one of
only seven Pitt wrestlers to be a three-time
All—American.

“It’s an honor to have my name men-
tioned with the other three-time All-
Americans,” VV1throw said. “Pitt has a lot
of tradition, and it’s nice to know you’ll be
a part of that tradition.”

But now, the 23-year-old \V1throw is
not an active wrestler for the ﬁrst time
since he was seven.

“It’s deﬁnitely a lifestyle change. I’m
going to have to ﬁnd some other things to
do with my time,” he said. “I’m going to
miss it, but right now I’m just taking some
time to relax.” '

Withrow will have plenty to keep him
busy. He’s enrolled in graduate school at
Pitt and is going to get more involved in
research. Grades and academics have
always been a major priority for Withrow,

Academic All—American.

His dual success on the mat and in the
classroom make him “exactly what Pitt
wrestling looks for in a student athlete,”
according to Head Coach Rande
Stottlemyer.

“John’s involved in campus activities,
he’s more of a vocal leader, and he’s a
good person for the younger guys to go
and talk to, someone who can relate
because he’s been there before.”

\V1throw is not only a model athlete
and a model student, but a model person.
He’s someone the University will be
proud of for years to come.

“I deﬁnitely don’t have any regrets. I
gave myself every opportunity in college,”
Withrow notes. “I set some

MarkBodo

For the past four years, Mark Bodo
has been Pitt’s quiet leader. A man of lit-
tle words but big arms and big wins, Bodo
has anchored this Pitt squad, and his per-
formances on the mat have done his talk-
ing for him.

Before his matches, Bodo’s cold, con-
ﬁdent glare sends intimidating chills up
the spines of his opponents. Once the
whistle sounds to start the match, Bodo
comes at the guy like a bull, getting right
in his face and usually dominating the
entire contest.

It’s all business on the mat for Bodo
—-— no showboating or ﬂashiness. He cares
only about winning, and that’s exactly
what he did 107 times in his Pitt career.

“You love the way a guy like that
wrestles. He thrives on competition,”
Stottlemyer explained.

Bodo’s 107-35 record is ﬁfth best in
Pitt history, and his sixth-place ﬁnish at
the NCAAs two weeks ago made him one
of only seven Pitt grapplers to ﬁnish in the
top eight three times (he ﬁnished fourth in
1997 and sixth in 1996).

Bodo credits his father for much of his
success and for developing his unwaver-

and he talked to me. He did-
n’t force me to stay with it,
but we weighed the pros and
cons of quitting, and that con-
vinced me to stay with it.”

Pitt fans are sure glad he

stayed with it. But it’s scary
to think how close Bodo came to taking
his athletic ability to the gridiron instead of
the wrestling mat.

“At the beginning of his senior year,
we recruited him. He told us no, he want-
ed to play football,” Stottlemyer related. In
the springtime he had a great year
[wrestling], and he rethought his posi-
tion.”

Ironically, the same sport that almost

lured Bodo away from wrestling was the
sport that introduced him to the mat in the
first place.

“I was eight or nine, and I played foot-
ball ﬁrst,” Bodo explained. “I had friends
that played football who wrestled, so
when the end of the [football] season
rolled around, they went out for the
wrestling team, so I did too.”

Bodo said that at this point, his
wrestling career is ﬁnished. He will grad-
uate in December and
pursue a career in
pharmaceutical
sales.

Nick Mengerink

The huge
bruise on Nick
Men gerink’s
elbow all the
way up to his
chest is more
than just the
result of his
painful torn
bicep mus-
cle.

Nick ngerink hopes to tackle the next three tourneyssans injury.

Thursday, 2 April 1998

It’s a symbol that represents the guts
and desire that have many people compar-
ing him to some of the best wrestlers in
school history  even Santoro, Pitt’s all-
time wins leader and two-time national
champion.

“He’s got a lot of the same character-
istics,” Stottlemyer said. “He’s got that
desire, you can see it. He really wants [to
be national champion] and he’s willing to
pay the price to get there.”

Mengerink, a redshirt freshman, tore
his bicep muscle during the NCAA cham-
pionships two weeks ago. But instead of
withdrawing from the tournament, he con-
tinued to wrestle with the excruciating
injury until he clinched eighth place, good
enough to earn him All—America honors.

It was only after he reached this point
that Mengerink told his coaches about the
injury. He withdrew from the tournament,
but if he had never gotten hurt, he would
have continued to wrestle and more than
likely would have ﬁnished higher than
eighth.

Mengerink arrived at Pitt as a highly
touted recruit out of tiny Upper Sandusky,
Ohio. He sat out all of last year as a red-
shirt before exploding into the lineup this
season.

He led the team in wins — his
remarkable 34-4 record was the best ever
by a Pitt freshman.

“When he ﬁrst got here last year,
‘  Bodo and I could beat him
handily, but he would never
‘I quit going hard against us,”
VV1throw noted. “He just
kept getting better and better and by this
year we were all even.

“He has more drive than anyone I’ve
ever seen. I would be very, very surprised

if he’s not a national champion sometime

in the near future.”

young, so we’ve done more scrim-
maging than we did last year,” said
Harris. “Any time we scrimmage,
we teach our guys more about
where they are at. We teach them to

 

understand our schemes on both
sides of the ball, as well as where
they are in executing.”

The Blue—Gold game also
comes at a time when the coaching
staff is evaluating its spring corps.
This weekend’s scrimmage should
shed light on the decisions that the
coaching staff will make over the
summer.

“We’re in a little bit of a no-
man’s land,” Harris explained, in
referring to player evaluations.
“We’re getting a little better, some
guys are getting a little better,
some guys are not getting better.
But we hope that the dust clears
here soon so each player can figure
out what they’re supposed to do to
play better.”

On Saturday, the offense will
be pitted against the defense in
four 15-minute quarters. Scoring
will be divided between the two
teams. The offense will be awarded
seven points for a touchdown and
three points for a ﬁeld goal, while
the defense will get three points for
forcing the offense to punt after
only three plays, three points for a
turnover, seven points for a touch-
down, two points for a safety and
one point for stalling an offensive
drive and forcing a punt.

Kickoff time on Saturday is 1
p.m. The event is free to the public.

These teams are usually forced to accept bids

from the likes of the Holiday Bowl and other bowls ,

that often seem to be forgotten by halftime.

It will just be another game for gamblers to 5
dabble with and for newspaper columnists to poke 1
fun at, but these teams have one thing going for 1

them Hawaii.

Next thing you know, the newswires will be
ﬂooded with reports that Wyoming players have
been caught in a point—shaving scandal, all in an
attempt to lose the WAC title game and be forced
to play in the Mele Kalikimaka Classic.

Not a bad idea. ,

WAC Commissioner Karl Benson agrees.

“We’ve always looked at the Jeep Aloha Bowl
as a game the WAC would love to be afﬁliated
with. If there was to be a second game, we would
deﬁnitely be interested.”

The Mele Kalikimaka Classic has a good shot
at becoming reality for three simple reasons.

One, there is a deﬁnite site already in place.

Two, there is a lucrative television deal already
in place with ESPN.

And finally, both the WAC and Pac 10
Conferences are in favor of the new game.

Ticket and sponsorship packages are currently
in the ‘works and will likely be solidiﬁed by the
NCAA’s meeting next month.

The bowl committee will also be voting on two
other possible bowl games, the Music City Bowl in
Nashville and a bowl to be named later that will be
played in Mobile, Ala.

Maybe it’s me, but they make Hawaii sound
even better.

Tennis sweeps St. Bonaventure, Davis one win from record

Kindra Wykoff
Staff Wrlter

Senior Fran Davis took the court
Tuesday against St. Bonaventure only three
wins away from breaking Pitt’s all—time ten-
nis win record.

In the course of a few hours, Davis
grabbed a doubles victory, then came away
with a 6-1, 6-0 singles win over the
Bonnies’ Andrea Irons.

Pitt went on to a 6-0 sweep of the
Bonnies.

And Davis is now only one win away.

She plans to capture that win on April
7, when Pitt takes on a tough Duquesne
team.

“I’1l be excited when I break the record
in a couple days,” Davis said with a smile.

That smile is probably because the
team she’s hoping to break the record
against is a city rival and one of Pitt’s tough-
est competitors. .

The record doesn’t just occupy her
mind, though. It’s also on her coach’s and
teammates’ minds as well.

During Tuesday’s doubles matches,

Championships. If they have one more
great performance in their home gym,
Yohman thinks they could be the ones
going to UCLA for the national ﬁnal.

“We all start out with 200 points,”
explained Yohman, in referring to a per-

1 fect team score in gymnastics. “It is up to
the team to keep them.”
Yohman expects competition to be
. very tight and says that second— through
sixth—p1ace scoring will be extremely
, close.
The top seven of 15 teams in the
Northeast region, based on team average
 scores, qualiﬁed for regional action. They
* are Penn State (194.2l9), Ohio State
(193.719), New Hampshire (193.306),
Massachusetts (192.862), Kent State
, (l91.5l9), Pitt (190.319), and Rutgers
(189.537).
To make nationals, the teams need to
t be almost perfect. Only the top ﬁnisher
qualiﬁes for nationals, making every frac-
tion of a point important. The team that
ﬁnishes in second place has chance of
' making it to nationals as a wildcard. This
. depends on the team’s score compared to
those of other regional ﬁnishers.

Penn State and Ohio State are two of
the top 10 teams in the nation battling it
out for the opportunity to travel to UCLA
to represent the Northeast region for
nationals on April 16-18.

‘ Penn State comes in as the favorite.
g Since 1992, the Nittany Lions have been
 to NCAA championship ﬁve out of six
1 times. Leopolus will help lead the team in
hopes of capturing the top score once
again; she has been the top all-around
scorer at regionals two seasons in a row.
Hoping to deny Penn State is Susan

Eckman, Mindi Farmer, Kelly Harper and
the rest of the Buckeyes. Ohio is an
extremely strong all-around team with a

lot of talent on vault — Eckman has

scored a perfect 10 on that apparatus three
times this season. She also received a 10
on the uneven parallel bars in a meet
against Kent State and Michigan State a
few weeks ago.

New Hampshire could be the surprise
team, coming off an impressive EAGL
championships performance two weeks
ago at Rutgers.

The “Roman Empire” and Kent State
are set to make their full at nationals this
weekend. Co-captain Danielle Roman,
nicknamed the “Roman Empire,” looks to
play an important role in this bid. She has
won six of 10 all-around individual com-
petitions this season. Strong perfor-
mances by Sarah Wolford and Kelly
Dezman will also be important to the
Golden Flashes’ success.

Seventh-seed Rutgers is excited just
to be coming to Pitt. The Scarlett Knights
are the Cinderella team who knocked off
Rhode Island by .051 points after being
told they had no chance of attending the
regional championships. Sophomore
Dana Koga, a Pittsburgh native, will
return home from school to try to beat her
personal best on the balance beam, which
she set at the EAGL championships two
weeks ago.

Teams will begin arriving for region-
als this Thursday. They will have two
practice sessions on Friday.

On Saturday, the NCAA regional
action begins at 6 p.m. Tickets can be
bought in advance at the ticket ofﬁce or
on the day of the event. Reserved seating
is $8 and general admission seating is $5
for adults and $3 for students and chil-
dren.

_Bucher did the same, ﬂip-ﬂopping the

score, 6-1, 6-2.

Il)|‘.1Y!)

Amanda Hoffman didn’t give her com-
petition a chance to even score a point. She
romped over Heather O’B1ien, 6-0, 6-0.

Dana Jafarian held the day’s second-
longest match. She won 7-6, 6-1.

The trophy for the longest match of the
day went to Lindsay Carlson and St.
Bonaventure’s Sarah VV1lcox.

Neither seemed to be able to get that
extra-hard hit to grab the match, yet neither
was willing to give in.

Frustration, as well as fatigue, began
setting in for both players. At one point,
Carlson threw her iacquet to the ground
after returning a ball into the net.

Finally, though, as twilight approached
and the novice tennis players stood waiting
for an open court, Carlson won the last set.
She took the match, 6-2, 2-6, 6-3.

The attention sunounding Carlson’s -

match now turns back to Davis and the
prospect of breaking the decades—old record

of 116 victories, set by Julie LoPiinzi in i

1975.

“Twenty-three years is a lot of time to
go by. A lot of players came and went over
the years,” said Dietfenbach.
