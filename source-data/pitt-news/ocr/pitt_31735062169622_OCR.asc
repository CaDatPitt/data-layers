  Students Report ‘Alternatives’ Theft

by BRUCE LEVENSON
Staff News Editor
(S00 I:'(li(m'iuI. I’(l_'_,"¢' 4)

The third issue of Alternatives
(“a student newspaper”) was re-
leased last Friday at 11 a.m. It
was an all ROTC issue including
an article about the suppression
of the freedom of speech, writ-
ten by a student ROTC second
lieutenant. T

Vic Willem, SG parliamentari-
an, came into the SU lobby at
around 11:45 a.m. and picked up
a copy of Alternatives from a
stack of, according to Willem,
“about 500-1,000 copies.” At the
same time, Willem noticed a
member of Pershing Riﬂes (a fra-
ternity of ROTC members) tak-
ing approximately 50 copies of
Alternatives.

On Wil1em’s way to the SG of-
__fices on -the third floor, the same

PR member passed him, this time
carrying a stack of Alternatives
about twice as thick as the first
pile. In back of him. according
to Willem, were‘six or seven other
cadets, each carrying a pile of
the newspapers. Willem saw three
other students in the third floor
hallway and informed them as to
what was taking place.

Willem was with Joe Kociubes,
CAS cabinet chairman, Peggy
Roth and -Dale English. Accord-
ing to Kociubes, the ‘three of them
were standing in front of the
WPGH office on the third floor
which is situated around the cor-
ner from the SG and PR offices.
Willem approached them claim-
ing that PR members were con-
fiscating all of the issues of «Al-
ternatives. They stood with Wil-
lem and watched these students
walk down the hall carrying the
Alternatives.

Reporters Threatened

Pitt News reporters Peggy Allen and Virginia Joyce claim to
have been threatened by ROTC Cadet Glenn Dolfi during a con-

verstation held Sunday morning.

Dolfi was asked by the two staff members about the alleged
theft of the latest issues of Alternatives. He told the reporters that
he hoped that the Pitt News would not print anything about the _in-

cident.

“Why?” the reporters inquired.

Dolfi replied that it was because the general belief that Persh-
ing Rifles had committed.the robbery was false. “It was only three

individuals who did it,” Dolfi stated.

“How do you know that?” he was asked.

Dolfi did not answer.

“You were part of it, then?” Miss Allen wanted to know.

“I can admit it to you here,” Bolfi said.
prove it, because I’ll deny that I said it.”

“But nobody can

Then, the three of them discussed the ROTC question for about
45 minutes. Dolfi, according to the reporters, would not reveal any
details of the incident, although admitting to have taken part in it.
Miss Allen asserts that Dolfi was unable to hide the fact he was
quite proud of what he had done. “He thought that it was really

cool,” she said.

‘Just before the discussion ended, Dolfi threatened that, “If
he Pitt News prints anything about this incident, they’ll find

hemselves on‘th'e floor beaten up.”

1969, as applicable to the men's

Although I had anticipated ap-
proval of the changes after re-
ceiving the unanimous endorse-
ment of the Social Committee, a
decision became extremely dif-
ficult due to various reactions
from students between Nov. 12,
when the proposal was received
and the final action on Nov. 15.
Because of student appeals. ap-
proval is granted with the follow-
ing limitation. _The new social
rules, as received from the Uni-
versity Social Committee, will be

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

The four of them watched these

PR members carrying newspapers

around the corner on the third
floor. Around this corner is a dead
end. There is no stairwell. There

. were only three places where
these students could have gone:
the Angel Flight office, Persh-
ing Rifle office, or Student Gov-
vernment. Only one SG office
was open—Joe Kociubes’. Since
Kociubes did not know any of the
people he saw transporting the
magazines, he assumed they were
not going to his office.

The four of them went around
the corner to the SG office, which
is directly across the hall from
the PR office. They watched the
newspaper traffic file into the
PR office, for about ten minutes.

Around noon, Willem went to
the SU lobby to see how many is-
sues of Alternayives were left.
All of them were gone—just one
hour after their release. Willem
called Assistant Chancellor of
Student Affairs Jack Critchfield,

who was out at the time, and,

Thomas Tackage, associate direc-
tor of the SU.

At the same time, Miss Roth
entered the PR office and spoke
with Jack La Pietra, president of
the ROTC brigade. According -to
her, she said, “I can’t get a hold
of a copy of Alternatives. I un-
derstand that you are distributing
them from here.”

La Pietra replied that, “We
only have one or two copies but
we’ll give you one.”

In the meantime, Dr. Jonathon
Harris (advisor to Alternatives)
and Major Henry Gordon (advi-
sor to Pershing Rifles) were sum-
moned to the PR office. As they
entered, PR members Glenn Dol-
fi and Robert Castner were leav-
ing. Dolfi was carrying what Wil-
lem described as “an overstuffed
gunny sack.”

Willem explained to these two
cadets that the Alternatives had
been stolen and that Pershing
Rifles was believed to be the vil-
lain. To eliminate any doubt,

rules in the women’s residence
halls will await endorsement af-
ter a referendum V0t€ Which iS 110
be conducted on Nov. 17 and re-
ported to this office as soon as
possible. It was learned through
a communique received from
AWS and by the previously men-
tioned visits and phone calls from
women students that the new so-
cial rules had not been adequate-
ly circulated or discussed among
the women students. Many wom-
en were totally unaware that the
Rules were beingconsidered and
knew nothing of the proposal un-
til it appeared in last Monday's
issue of the Pitt News. As a re-
sult, the requests from women
students to the AWS president
have initiated the referendum
vote which will determine wheth-
er there is to be majority accep-
tance of the new rules by the
women students and, therefore,

approval by the administration of ’

Willem asked them to allow Dr.
Harris and Major Gordon to
search the bag. The issues were
seen entering the room. Willem
deducted that they were either
in the sack or in the PR office.
Dolfi refused to show what was
in the bag, but indicated that it
contained equipment only.

“had taken quite a few.” Major’
Gordon told the Pitt News that
he did not “think that the ques-
tion was asked.” Both Major Gor-A _
don and Dr. Harris admitted to‘ "
seeing only two or three issues of. '
the newspaper in the PR office.

At the same time, Willem went 
to the elevator. He waited for

 

 

Willem testified that he then
reached for the sack. Castner
blocked his way. Dolfi (in Wil-
lem’s words) “ran into a stair-
well.” Castner followed him. As
they were running down the
stairs, Willem pleaded with Dol-
fi to open the bag. Dolfi, once

again, refused.

La Pietra was in ‘the PR office
when Dr. Harris and Major Gor-
don entered. Dr. Harris asked Bob
Rudolph, director of PR, about
the purloined ‘newspapers. -Ru-
dolph, according to La Pietra, in-
vited Dr. Harris to search the of-
fice. He said that he would ac-
cept Rudolph’s word that the Al-
ternatives were not there. Ru-
dolph insisted, and searched the
office anyway. There were only
about 20 issues in the room, ac-
cording to La Pietra.

Dr. Harris asked one of the
members of ROTC who was in
the office at the time and how
many Alternatives had been tak-
en by PR. According to Dr. Har-
ris, the boy told him that they

tion of the rules as now present-
ed. A report on this referendum
and the subsequent action by this
office will be forthcoming to the
Pitt News as quickly as possible.

While a majority of men (and,
I assume, women students) ap-
pear to be in favor of the new. so-
cial rules, a sizeable minority of
students has voiced discontent
with what they feel will be a
loss of privacy. Other reasons for
disliking the new rules have been
voiced, but the one heard most
frequently in recent days has
been the invasion of privacy in
the residence halls resulting from
an increase in the number of
dorm-wide open houses. I respect
the opinion of those students and
hope very much that a solution
can be found to please all resi-
dent students. Unfortunately, our

about five minutes for the arrival
of an elevator. As the doors open-
ed, Dolfi and Castner emerged
carrying the same bag but, as,
Willem described it, a “limp and
empty” bag. V.

At this point, Willem decided
to give chase. He‘ attested that
Dolfi returned the sack to the
PR office and left with Arthur
Kellum, another ROTC . cadetj. 
Willem followed them. At this 
time, he claims to have heard Dol.-.
fi say to Kellum, “It was beauti-
ful . . .just marvelous . . .” He
followed the cadets out. of the
building and over to the Hillman
Library. _

There Dolfi opened the door of
a black Corvair. Willem pleaded.
with them to allow him to inspect!‘
the trunk of the car. According to‘
Willem, Kellum said that they,’
couldn't becuase they had to hur- '
ry to the PR fraternity house and
would be back by 2 p.m. Willem,’
stated that it was about 12:20 ,p-.m;tj'
at this time. i

when Alternatives c a m e o u t .
They were placed on a corner of
the counter of the booth. Dolfi,
according to Miss Wartella, came
by the booth around 12:15 p.m.
and confiscated the entire stack
of Alternatives. Before leaving,
he questioned Miss Wartella
about the publication. He wanted
to know what it was and who was
putting it out. She told him what
she knew about it and asked him
to leave a few copies for other
students.- According to Miss War-
tella, Dolfi replied, “We want all
of them.” He took them all and
left.

The Pitt News asked Castner
and Dolfi about the contents of
thd “mysterious” sack. “It was
full of camping equipment,”
Castner stated, “field jacket lin-
ers and boots.” .

“Were there any Alternatives
in the bag?” this reporter asked
Castner.

Castner answered, “There were

about‘16. I wanted to send them

to friends.”

-“There was only equipment in
the bag” Dolfi told the Pitt News
in a different interview, “two
pairs of combat boots, two ROTC
uniforms, cans of food, person-
al clothing, and shaving equip-
ment.” Why wasn’t Vic Willem
shown the contents of the sack‘?
“I was in a hurry to get to my
car and feed theimeter,” answer-
ed Dolfi. Was Willem allowed to

‘ inspect the trunk and the hood of

the automobile? “Absolutely, ’ ’,
Dolfi affirmed. '

Alternatives will be republish-

scheduled for re-release Wednes-
day.

A Travesty

- The University is ideally a center of learning where the

free expression of ideas is uninhibited. It is a center where
‘ views of the right and the left should be discussed rationally
. and openly. But a travesty to this ideal was committed Fri-
‘ day when practically all copies of Alternatives, a new jour-
nal on campus, were impounded.

It is quite significant that in this particular issue of Al-
ternatives, all the stories published contained opinions con-
trary to the beliefs and interests of the ROTC Brigade. One
’ very damaging article written by an ROTC second lieuten-
‘ant pointed to the supression of free ideas in the ROTC
classroom—a point that is continually denied by other ROTC
cadets. To be sure, the appearance of the Alternatives, Fri-
,. day, did not bring a warm. friendly response from the mem-
bers of the Brigade.

In fact, the response was so over-reactive that a few stu-
dents in the ROTC program allegedly sequestered the issues
in the name of decency, fair play, morality, and the United
States Army. A number of eyewitness accounts have been
collected, suggesting that a number of ROTC cadets carried
off huge stacks of Alternatives. University co-ed Ellen War-
tella witnessed a few men taking away some of the Alterna-
. tives issue. Miss Wartella said Glen Dolfi came into the Ca-
thedral around 12:15 p.m. and confiscated a whole stack of
‘Alternatives. She said that before leaving,- Mr. Dolfi asked

her who was responsible for putting out this publication.
‘She told him what she knew about the journal, and asked Dol-
-fi to leave a few copies for other students. Dolfi replied:
“We want all of them.” After making this statement, Mr.
Dolfi took the stack of papers and left the Cathedral, accord-
ing to Miss Wartella. Mr. Dolfi is a member of ROTC.

Similar identifications were made in the Student Union.
There SG Parliamentarian Vic Willem claims that a num-
ber of ROTC students were carrying stacks of Alternatives
down the third ﬂoor hallway. Joe Kocuibes says that about
six students carrying Alternatives were walking down the
hall of the third floor. Two other students witnessed these
pecmiar events on the third floor. At the end of the third
floor of the nU there are three offices housing Angel Flight,
Pershing Riﬂes, and Student Government. Only one Student
Government office was vpen bt the time -- Joe Kocuibes’.
Not knowing any of the individuals carrying the papers, Ko-
cuibes assumed they were not going to his office. Obvious-
_ly the self-appointed news-paper carriers went into either
_the Pershing Riﬂe office or the office of Angel Flight.

All of this is somewhat circumstancial. But we learned
yesterday that a number of alleged threats had been made
by Mr. Dolfi. Pitt News reporters Peggy Allen and Virginia
Joyce claim that Dolfi ‘said “if the Pitt News prints any-
thing about this incident they’.l. find themselves on the floor
: beaten up.” Earlier in his conversation with tod reporters,
Dolfi hoped that the Pitt News wouldn’t print anything about
the incident. When asked by Miss Allen if he had taken part‘
in the incident, Dolfi replied: “I can admit it yo you here.-
' But nobody can prove it, because I’ll deny that I said it!”

Such testimony recorded by two witnesses certainly im-
plicates Mr. Dolfi as a participant in the Alternatives heist.
Miss Allen and the other students quoted -have drawn up
1. signed statements concerning what they saw

It is a sad commentary on University life when a jour-
nal of any persuasion is confiscated by students who feel it
is there moral right to act as judge and jury. What right does
_any student have in suppressing free speech and free press?
The only right to such action is the self-‘ordained right to ex-
terminate the opposition by destroying its publication.

Similar totalitiarian tactics are carried out in the Soviet
Union where it is illegal to print material against the govern-
. .ment. Book burnings were in order during the early years of
the Third Reich. Hitler was fond of impounding detrimental
publications. Are we to assume that this should be permitted
in the United States? Are we to assume that publications at
' here should be confiscated — confiscated at this institution —
.. "an institution where the free cflow of ideas is supposedly un-
' _ inhibited?

The students who impounded Alternatives Friday should
be condemned for there un-American act, for they have vio-
lated the Constitution of the United States. They have de-
prived the student body the chance to judge a divergent point
, of view concerning the ROTC issue. In short, they have in

 fringed upon the rights of the students. V

-' , The students involved in. this incident owe the University
and the student body a public apology for their serious act.

What do you think Mr. Dolfi? _PAUL STOLLER’ Editor

For instance. a dorm counselor gets fired. Ev-

I -Opinionated Articles Stem From
Lack Of Time And Information

by DAVE TIERNAN
Staff News Editor

The Harmon-Conley case (see
letter below) sheds light on what
many students feel is the major
shortcoming of Pitt News report-
ers. Cries that reporters misquote
and editorialize in news stories
come to our office daily via let-
ters, phone calls and personal
visits. “Reporters should report
the news, and only the news”
these complaints seem to say.

Although I do not‘, and never
will, condone misquoting and ed-
itorializing, I"do feel that a few
facts should be faced by those
who offer added criticism to their
complaints, whether they be on
a general or personal level.

THE FIRST FACT is that al-
though we, as reporters, strive
for professionalism, we still re-

main amateur journalists. Often

times our opinions in news stories
stem from the fact that we lack
time needed to obtain the minor
details which add authenticity to
a news story. All reporters are

 

taught to keep opinion on the ed-
itorial page, but when classes,
homework, or jobs shorten the
time we may devote to a story, or
when certain people or groups re-
fuse to offer pertinent informa-
tion, opinions fill the gap be-
tween facts in news stories.
Many of our stories are follow-
ups to leads obtained from stu-
dents that do not work for the pa-
per. When time is short, these
stories often reflect only the side
-of the story the reporters are ex-
posed to first. What appears to
be opinion of the reporter is usual-
ly the opinion of the group, organ-
ization, or person with which the
reporter first comes in contact.

Another problem in this area is
the lack of well-trained reporters.
Often a columnist, who is accus-
tomed to writing only opinion-
ated articles, will follow a cer-

tain story out of interest in one’

side or another rather than be-
cause it is his or her job to cov-
er the story as a reporter.

THIS PROBLEM again brings

to mind the fact that we are stu-
dents striving toward perfection
— not accomplished reporters pos-
ing as students. Personally, I take
the majority of the criticism that
comes to the attention ‘of this of-
fice as a compliment. People cri-
ticize us for reasons that stem
from their belief that we are pro-
fessionals, and that at times we
do not carry out the task of re-
porters as they feel we should.

I am not making excuses for
our faults, nor am I saying that
we do nothing to eliminate them.
We are always open for construc-
tive criticism. It has been said
many times in the past, and I say
it again: This is your paper, not
ours, and it will be only as good
as you make it. Our doors are al-
ways open. ‘

, Opinionated news stories do
exist — we are the first to admit
it. —

But until we are professionals,
all we can do is to try to elimin-
ate them.

  Soccer Captain Lenny Harmon
  Clarifies Statements In Letter

     

Sports Editor, The Pitt News:

I am writing this letter to clari-
fy some of the statements which
were attributed to me in Wednes-
day’s issue of the Pitt News. One
of your sports writers, Ed Conley,
has taken some of my comments
out of context and used them to
imply that I ‘was downgrading
our football team. I would like to
make one thing clear right away.
At no time was my intent ‘to run
down our football team. Mr. Con-
ley has used my statements to
make a sensational story which
has raised even more problems
for an already problem filled ath-
letic department. 2 . , .

The first statement ‘attributed
to me was, “Tab soccer team is
not in the same boat as the foot-
ball team. We never quit.” The
statement I made was. “The soc-
cer team is not going to be put in
the same boat that the Pitt News
has put the football team in.” (In
the Monday, Nov. 4. issue of the
Pitt News, the sports editor stat-
ed that the football team doesn’t
care, that they have no pride,
that they rolled over and played
dead, and that there were many
of them who didn’t want to play.
These statements were made by
the sports editor after the Miami

game.) -In other ..words the-Pitt‘ -

News looks upon the football

team as a bunch of quitters.

In this Monday’s. issue of the
Pitt News the sports department
decided to do a so-called clever
thing. They printed a black page
with all the weekend sports re-
sults listed on the page.‘ To me
this was a personal slap at every
athlete at this University. Even
though I understand that the in-
tent was to sum up the whole ath-
lete situation, I think it was in
poor taste since it directlyvtook a
slap at the athletes also. I inter-
preted this action of the Pitt
News as an implication that the

members of the soccer team as
well as the football team were a
bunch of quitters. I made the
above statement in the light of
this act by the Pitt News on Mon-
day.

One other statement I would
like to clear up is the following
one attributed to me, “Pride. The
football team doesn’t have it.”
At no time did I make such a state-
ment. As an athlete myself, I
know how other athletes feel, and
I know that every athlete has
pride in himself and pride in his

~; school. I said that one of the rea-

sons the soccer team has never
been out of any of its games was

 
 
 

Editor, The Pitt News,

A complex organization, such
as this university, is sometimes re-
sistant to any substantial change
merely because its constituency
is hesitant to abolish member in-
situations of long-standing. Thesd,
often out-dated or undesirable in-
stitutions perpetuate themselves,

What is the logic behind the

(value of the presence of ROTC

on this campus? If this program has
been instituted to recruit and train
leaders for our armed forces, can
that function not be carried on
off-campus, equally well? ROTC
occupies office space on the fourth
floor of the Cathedral, has ac-
cess to rooms in the Student Un-
ion for their own extracurricular
activities, uses University grounds
for the drilling of men, and is al-
lowed to award (as incentive for
enrollment) credit hours for train-

L ing, not study, in the art of war.

And what does this institution
offer the University in return,‘
commensurate to these benefits?
Except for the comforting
knowledge that “ROTC trains men,
the program contributes nothing
of tangible importance to this

 
 

because we had pride. The Pitt
News reporter has implied that I
think the football team has no
pride because they have been out
of many of their games. I do not
think this. I have many good
friends on the football team and I
know that they have pride. Even
though they lose they haven’t
given up.

One thing I did want to appear
in that article was the fact that
the members of the soccer team
are highly disappointed because
not one bit of coverage was given
to our near upset victory over
Akron, the number one team in

the nation. In the future I would.

‘VI!

deeply appreciate it if the Pitt
News would stick to reporting
the facts as they are, instead of
misinterpreting the facts. I
think the Pitt News owes me an
appology for causing me the per-
sonal humiliation that I have felt
in the past few days. It isn’t
nice when your fellow athletes
think that you consider them to be

quitters. In my opinion, no athlete
here is a quitter. We are all just
a victim of many ciricumstances
beyond our control. All we can
keep doing is our best, which I’m
sure every football player is do-
ing. ‘

University. (As a matter of fact,
of ROTC trains the only men on
campus, that qualifies the rest of
non Rotsies as practicing trans-
vestites. Sort of unnerving, isn’t
it? ’

Perhaps a skeptical reader may
dismiss these arguments, de-
claring that they are not strong
enough to warrant the removal of
ROTC from campus. To these cri-
tics a second question must be pos-
ed. What right, if any, does ROTC
have to stay on this campus? The
armed forces are, in the end, an-
other government — supported,
corporate structure, requiring
skilled leadership for a large la-
bor force.

If we allow one such structure
the right to use campus facili-
ties for their own ends, in all
fairness, we should allow all such

 

structures the same right; however,

this is neither the function nor
the capacity of this University.
There is one final argument
against the continued existence
of ROTC at this school. Support-
ers of the program often cry that

discrimination against any par- *

ticular organization on campus is

undemocratic and thus anathema
to the University’s deepest prin-
ciples; however, "these people
fail to follow their own reasoning.

If their complaint is that students,
_the main force behind the Uni-

versity, should not be allowed to

selectively affect a military or- P

ganization on campus, then, like-
wise, the Armed Forces, the force
behind ROTC, should not be al-
lowed to selectively affect the lives

of students, both graduate and un- _

dergraduate.

Obviously then, there is little
logical or justifiable support for
the belief that ROTC has a proper
place on this campus or in this
University community; neverthe-
less as long as students and faculty
remain silent, ROTC will continue

to exist in its present form of parasi-

tical non—reciprocation. Perhaps
the time has come to break this:
hesitation to speak out, and de-
mand that the University communi-
ty sever its relationship with this
military institution. AI Vogel

Booters Rip F rostburg, 351,

As S pirtes .Pro<vide Spark

by ED CONLEY

“Unity is the key to our improvement,” ,

said soccer coach Leo Bemis.

But, it was actually breaking up a unit that
brought about Saturday’s 3-1 victory over-Frost-
burg. Bemis replaced Conference Lekoma on his
front line with a substitute, Dave Spirtes, in the

. middle of the third period. The score wastied, 1-1,

at that time. .

Spirtes’ hustle woke up the booters, With Spirtes
and Lou Vida on _the ground, in a couple inches of
mud, and in front of the Bobcat goal, one of the
Frostburg fullbacks touched the ball with his hand.

This set up a penalty kick, which hit the nets.

' Vida scored the goal, his second of the game.

Then, a few minutes later, Spirtes was in front
of the goal again. He took a rebound and went right
into the left side of the goal with the ball in front
of him.

The only Bobcat goal was scored at 2:20 of the
second period and sent the game into a deadlock
at halftime.

Bemis explained the insertion of Spirtes into
the line-up for those few minutes of the third
quarter: “I’ve tried at all times not to disturb
unity. But, Spirtes showed me he could do the job
when we scrimmaged in the mud during the week.

“Some were suprised: I’m' not.
played much, but he’s a real hustler — when given

a chance to play. And, he’s getting better each game,”

the coach continued. _
He also had praise for )his defensive unit. “When

 

He hasn’t '

   
 

, ‘end uppyvit_h’so,mething.’* :~

“And our fullbacks are not experienced. Take
Bruce Searfoss,” Bemis mentioned. -“He didn’t
letter last year. And, not to single one man out, he
played areal nice game.”

As for the defense of the opposition, Bemis re-

marked, “Their fullbacks were good and fast.-

They .Weren’t‘as mobile in the mud, though. We
tried to capatilize on this.”

This, the kickers did. Well enough to'win their
third game in ten tries this fall. The coach went on
to explain his team’s sudden improvement.

“Like I’ve been saying all along,” he commented,
“and people don’t pay attention, we’ve been injury
riddled. But, inthe past four games we’ve had the
same line-up,” he reasoned. _ .. I V

“Also, the shifting of (Randy) Dry to fullback,”
he continued. “All in all, it’s been a matter of jel-
ling together, too.

“The team is playing together as a unit, and the
ones we have want to play,” he added.

Sticking to the unity theme, Bemis indicated
pleasure in the play of his halfbacks, Norm Roux
and Vida.

“They’re now playing as a unit, too,” he related.

“And, the halfbacks connect the defense and off-

ense.” .
Defense and offense, that’s'the game, all right

— And, the kickers are finally putting the game to-

gether. The results are in striking contrast to the

final scores earlier in the season.

This is, indeed, good news for Bemis.___At one
time it looked like the fall ‘would be dis-
astrous. “Now,” said the coach. “thisp'shows we’ll

   
  

   

we would make it.

“I had confidence in the boys
and more important, the boys had
confidence in themselves,” he
continued. “I know it wasn’t the
wisest thing to do, but who was I
to destroy the confidence that
the boys had finally developed.”

The only other scoring effort
the Panthers were able to amount
.'occured before the end of the half .

when they marched from their own 

20 to the Cadet 10, but failed to
score when Joe Spicko’s field
goal attempt from the 17 sailed
low and short of the goal post.
As in the earlier drive Ferris
gained most of the yardage and
finished the half with 105 yards
in 21 carries. He finished with
112 yards in 27 attempts before
leaving the game with a hip in-'
jury.

The weather and the muddy
field took away from both teams,
passing game. Both‘ offenses
were unable to complete a pass in
the first half as Havern was 0-5,
while Steve Lindell, Army’s sen-
ior signal caller, was 0-7. In the

final statistics the Panther quar- 
terbacks were 3-18, with 2 inter-

cepted, and Lindell was 2-13, with
one interception. _

Even though the weather ham-
pered the passing, the throwing

«of quarterback Havernxwas off-

target forthe third game in a row.

With ample protection provided

by his linemen, Havem either

overthrew his open receivers or an-
gled his sideline passes too far,

so that the receptions had to be

made out of bounds.

On the other side of the line,
Cadet Lindell called a very ef-
fective game and read the Pan-
ther defenses extremely well.
He picked up 38-yards in ten
attempts, with 30 of them com-
ing on Army’s first touchdown,
in the third period.

, “I saw Pitt coming at us with a
blitz, and I called an automatic,
and carried the ball in the oppo-
site direction,” explained Lindell.
Hefurther went on and praised
the Panther defensive squad for
their hard hitting and the fact
that they never stopped coming
at us.”

Final Game

by MARTIN HELLMAN
Freshman soccer team fin-

ally took advantage of its ability »- 3'“:

to control the action of a game.
Previous to Saturday’s con-
test with the Frostburg State
freshmen, the booters had lost
two of their three games although
they had completely dominated
the play in all of them,

This time, the kickers scored
two quick goals in the first quar-
ter and then coasted to a 5-1
victory. Again, they overpowered
the opposition by keeping the ball

in their offensive area for the ma- '

jority of the match.

Despite the rain and muddy
fields, Coach Pete Snyder feels
that the squad passed well. “Al-
though the footing was bad and

several players ‘slipped or .attem-er

pted shots, the boys performed as

High Hawks Shutout Owls; ‘Bubba’    

 Tierman Passes Pace Win

by AED E. ORNAUT

“We owe it all to O.J.,” said Hawk signal-caller Dave “GI”
Tiernan after the fabulous Pitt News Hawks overpowered the
Owls, 20-0, before a capacity crowd at the Schenley Oval

uesterday.

What “GI” was referring. to was the spiked orange juice he and
defensive back Jerry “LeRoy” Gruebel drank before the game.

“We were really up for this
game,” said “GI” skating off
the mud field, “In fact, you could
say we were high.”

The Hawks showed a definite
team effort in humiliating the
hapless, unwise Owls. With the
help of stubborn blocking by Ho-
bie “Warmonger” Harris and Roy
“Jumpshot” Jacobs, “GI” had
plenty of time to find ends Paul
“Benito” Stoller and George
“Moustachio” Lies in the clear.

But once again, the Hawk of-
fensive unit was unified by Art
“Bubba” Rosengarten’s quick
snaps from center.

“I owe all my success to ‘Bub-
ba,’ beamed “GI”, “There were
times when I was drowsy and about
to fall asleep, but “Bubba’s” cen-
ter-snaps came at me so fast that
if I didn’t stay alert I knew I’d
become the headless Hawk.”

The defense however, was once »

again the mainstay of the unde-
feated Hawks. “Jumpshot” and

'V“Benito” each stifled Owl drives

with incredible interceptions,
while “LeRoy” tripped up many
a’ would-be receiver.

“Moustachio” was elated af-
ter the Hawks fourth consecutive
victory of the season. He credi-
ted his numerous pass receptions
to the added inspiration of the

Give    
contact lenses
abath  

 

In order to keep your contact lenses as
comfortable and convenient as they were
meant to be, you have to take care of
them. But until now you needed two or
more separate solutions to properly I
prepare and maintain your contacts. Not
with Lensine. Lensine is the one lens
solution for complete contact lens care.

Cleaning your contacts with Lensine
' retards the buildup of foreign deposits on
the lenses. And soaking your contacts in
Lensine overnight assures you of proper
lens hygiene. You get a free soaking case
on the bottom of every bottle of Lensine.

It has been demonstrated that improper
storage between wearings may result in
the growth of bacteria on the lenses.
This is a sure cause of eye irritation and
in some cases can endanger your vision.
Bacteria cannot grow in Lensine which is
sterile, self-sanitizing, and antiseptic.

Just a drop or two of Lensine, before you
insert your lens, coats and Iubricates it
allowing the lens to float more freely in
the eye's fluids. That's because
Lensine is an "isotonic” solution,
which means that it blends with
the natural fluids of the eye.

   

Let your contacts be the
convenience they were

meant to be. Get
