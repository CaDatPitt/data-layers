Faculty
Committee
Formed

The newly formed Student Af-
fairs Committee of the Universi-

- ty,Senate elected Dr. Robert Ag-

new, associate professor of busi-

’ ness administration, as its chair-

man. At its ﬁrst meeting Monday
the 11 man committee discussed
the range of roles it may serve.

Dr. Albert Martin, professor of
political science, highlighted the
differences between faculty and
administrator relations with stu-
dents, by relating his experience
as dean of the School of Liberal

 from 1960-65. “When a per-

#-

‘ .»/isitudent is able to deeply inves-

son saw me in the Liberal Arts"
office, he couldn't help but see
the dean. We now hope to avoid
‘this formality.”

Dr. Martin described the evolu-
tion of education from the gen-
eral survey to the speciﬁc exam-
ple. First the doors to the disci-
plines are opened. Then the dis-
cipline is explored. Finally the

tigate an area of primary con-
cern.

“I don't think a faculty mem-
ber can perform his function in
la. situation of personal remote-
ness, though I have some reserva-
tions about the Mr. Chips type.
The ﬁrst responsibility of a fac-
ulty member is to bring students
into touch with the interest and
the rigor of a discipline and be a

, social human being in the pro-

-as.

 cess.”

  

The University will enroll 1,000
more students, if it becomes state-
related this summer. Dr. Martin
considered the possible impact of
this number on the st_udent-fac-
ulty ratio. “With the right man
you can open a relativelylarge
number of doors and encourage
the interest of many students des-
pite the large ratio. However, if
you want a concentration of
studies, this can only be achieved
with a smaller ratio.

“In some circumstances a 50:1
ratio is useful in others a 10:1 ra-
tio is useless. A good curriculum
takes this into consideration.”

The members include: Dr. Mor-
ris Berkowitz, associate professor
of sociology; Dr. Myron Garfun-
kle, professor - of physics; Dr.
Frederick Gottlieb, associate pro-
fessor of biology; Dr. Paul Mc-
Lain, clinical instructor of ortho-
pe'dic surgery; Dr. Erma Meyer-
son, professor of social work; Dr.

"Karl Oerman, professor of edu-.

: cation; Dr. Maxine,_ associate pro-

ate r

Monday, spent most of his
time answering the ques-
tions of students concerning
the Selective Service tests,
the status of graduate students,
and draft policy in general.
Discussion on the draft tests
centered on the nature of the
score gaining deferment. The
scores of 70 for undergraduates
and 80 for graduate students are
percentages, not absolute ﬁgures,
according to the General. In other
words, an undergraduate would
have to answer 105 of the 150
questions correctly‘ and graduate
students would have to answer
120 of the questions correctly.

But Hershey added that, “Stu-
dents should take nothing as
guaranteed.”

-When queried about the draft
probability of non-science stu-
dents as compared to science stu-
dents, Hershey admitted that it is
usually harder to convince a
board that a non-science student
shouldn’t be drafted before a sci-
ence major, merely because of
the, fact that we live in a tech-
nological society.

Gen. Hershey said that he felt
there would be some move in the
next session of Congress for the
establishment of some sort of uni-
versal military training program.

Political
Union
Proposed

The Student Government
Allocations Committee r an
into two basic problems; a
ﬁnancial overlap among stu-
dent groups requesting
money, and an intellectual

gap in the group programs, their»

solution, a political Union.

The Allocation Committee Pro-
posed the Union would function
as a non-artisan committee, se-
lecting series of ' social critics to
ispea at the University annually.
The committee only suggested
the idea as a basis for some group
to go on, presently Bill Cabin,
acting as a representative _of ODK,
is working with Bill Weber, pres-
identof Students for Peace, and
Mahmood Mamdarni, representing
the International Relations Club
in tryng to work out a formal pro-
gram which they will submit to
the Allocatons Committee in the
Fall.

Their basic gials stated Cabin.
are; obtaining a workable pro-
gram, this includes cost estimates,
confering with a group of profes-
sors “who ‘are most concerned
with social issues, and know,
really know what speakers to
bring,” and ﬁnally obtaining the
funds.” «

“Consolidation is the main
problem,” continued Cabin, “be
cause we can not pull in good
speakers without it.”

When questioned bout the pro-
p0sal,- most people thought the
ideas was “worth a try.”

Bill’ Weber, stated that he is
“basically for it. He fells that the
workshop would p r 0 vi d e a
“means for greater
present the student body with
more than one view, and provide
someone to‘ argue with.”

“Iit could be good,” stated Dr.

Problems faced by the Stu-

dent Activities Fee Alloca-
tions Committee were re-
vealed and criteria used in
making allocations were at-

tacked, Sunday, as Student
Government (SG) held its ﬁrst
meeting of the Spring trimester;

In a report submitted to SG, ’

the Allocations Committee listed
four procedural problems which
arose while the committee was
making its decisions for the
Spring trimester: (1) The inabil-
ity, due to the lack of time, to
adequately interview officers of
g r o u p s requesting allocations;
(2) The lack of information from
applicants were two of the prob-
lems, and (3) The lack of bids on
equipment that 'was requested
and “incomplete” or inaccurate”
budgets were two reasons given
for the latter problem.

A review by the Student Rec-
ognition Committee Was suggest-
ed as a, possible solution to the
third problem of having no ob-
jective means for evaluating a
groups program in the past. The
fourth trouble encountered by the
committee was the lack of for-
malized basis for allocating funds.

Each of these problems appear-
ed several times as William Cab-
in, a member of the Allocations
Committee, presented the ration-
ale used by the committee in
approving or refusing fund re-
quests. . ,

Of the $11,000 allocated, SG re-
ceived a huge allocation of'$9,000
to be used speciﬁcally for Home-
coming of 1966. '

The Homecoming allocation rep-
resents «a $8,000 increase over the
Activities Fee _allocation of last
year. Cabin explained that this
money was given so that the
Homecoming ‘Committee could
plan a “quality” program that
would deﬁnitely prove whether
or not students at the University
want good progr/aming.

Age of Protest to Pic

McNamara Speakis at Chatham

“The Age of Protest,” the keynote of Secretary of Defense Robert
S. McNamara’s Chatham College commencement address Sunday, was
appropriately symbolized by the picket lines outside Carnegie Music

Hall.

McNamara’s appearance at Carnegie Hall occasioned comments
by various University students who participated in the picketing,

vwhich was organized by the Pittsburgh Committee to End the War

in Vietnam,

Student for Peace Treasurer Frank Couvares, a member of the
Pittsburgh Committee, commented, “We let Secretary McNamara
know that anytime he leaves Washington, he must know -there is ac-
tive opposition to American foreign policy.” Couvares estimated that

' between 50-70 University students were present Sunday.‘He also point-

ed out that more adults than students took part in the protest.

  Union  
Allocation Criteria 

Under SG Attack  

. tions Committee" when Cabin-ex-

deserve funds from the Student;_'

Wednesday, May 25, 1966

SG Senators Terry Hyman and '
Basil Zitelli questioned the ma-
jor criterion used by the Alloca- 

plained the refusal of monies to T
two organizations on the basis of 
this standard. The criterion is 7
that allocations will be made >
only for programs which primari-

ly beneﬁt a large number of stu- _
dents directly. '

Hyman and Zitelli felt that
some projects, such as sending].
two members of the William Pitt}
Debate Union to England to par-‘:
ticipate in tournaments and send-.
ing some members of an educa-
tion group to a convention (which.
are the projects refused backing”--V",
by the Allocations Committee on "
the “greatest beneﬁt" criterion),f'

,2‘.

Activities Fee even though a _
great number of students Won’t'i
beneﬁt. ’ ,

Concern with the validity of 3
the standard also appeared in I
the committee’s report. However,
the committee has decided to con-
tinue using this criterion at least
until a ﬁnal decision is made-in
special August meeting of the‘?
committee. The group also hopes
to standardize openation proce-:-
dures and ﬁnancial report formsk...
and systemize certain allocations '
at the August meeting.

After reviewing these criticisms
and problems, SG approved all of
the Allocations Committee recom-
mendations except 1. the one for
Men’s Dorm Council, which was
returned to the committee for.-
reconsideration. 1 ‘

One non-allocation recommen-
dation was also made by the com-
mittee, the formation of a Politi-
cal Union. This Union would b
a bi-partisan confederation ‘of
“special interest - groups” .desigri-
ed to improve the programming
on social issues from both an iv”
tellectual and ﬁnancial viewpoint‘
stated the report. '

professor of history and social
" science. “The structure is very in-
frteresting, and useful and worth a
e 5 try.”
' Dr. Morris Berkowitz, associate
professor of sociology and social
._ science, called it a “ﬁne idea.” He
“‘”feels that the Student Union pro-
grams “hardly represent social
issues, and that the campus po-
litically is isolated. But he did
state some reservations in that
the “students do not use what
-,r-,.the now have; there is a lack of
awareness and response.” Dr.
Berkowitz said that unlike the SU
, Noon Day formate, the speakers
should not be asked to prepare
a speech, but rather have a two
‘to three hour discussion program
with an informed panel. He added
'that the Union should take for-
mal measures that would quarant-
tee no domination by one side or
point or view.

 

The tudent groups could give a
signiﬁcant variety of programs a
political and social issues to sup-
plement the mainly “cultural”

" programs presented by the Stu-
dent Union, added Dr. Albert B.
artin, profesor of Political Sci-
ence and Social Science. _

“It is generally a good idea, and
there is deﬁnitely a job to be done
in this area, stated Dr. Martin,

rather an appreciative one for
me. I am not an artist, but I do
play the guitar. I tried to play
while high, but my intentions
were so far ahead of my ability
that I lovingly put the guitar back
into its case for more sober
times to come.

As far as food is concerned, I
usually don’t eat for a few hours
before I “go up,” and rarely have
much of an appetite subsequent-
1y. I even lose my usual hourly
urge for a cigarette. But I did
experience a food fascination one
time which ended with my slow-
ly eating about ten jars of differ-
ent baby foods over the period
of about an hour. 0

I hope all this doesn’t sound
sick to you, the reader, because it
is completely true and completely
personal. Perhaps you think that
I didn’t need LSD to experience
the things I did. You may be
right, just like you don’t need a
Ph.D. to be successful. In my
opinion, I ventured something
and gained from it. That should
make you happy for me. My only
point is to attempt a communica-
tion of my LSD experience on
Dapel

What about LSD at Pitt? Well,
I go to Pitt, but I don’t know of
any other LSD “addicts” on this
campus; I may be the only one. I
don’t sell LSD, nor do I know
where it can be bought in Pitts-
burgh. About a year ago Ibought
a small supply in another city
and it is just about used up. I
have had my kicks and I don’t in-
tend to replenish my supply. I’ll
probably just happily disappear
into the midst of American socie-
ty after I graduate.

Comes to Pittsburgh

-By BERNI McLEOD

The Russian word, bolshie, meaning big or grand, is the name
of one of the largest and most expensive dance troupes in the world.
In three weeks, Moscow’s Bolshie Ballet is coming to Pittsburgh.

On Friday and Saturday evenings, June 10 and 11, the company
will perform in the Civic Arena, equipped with 40 tons of scenery
and $250,000 worthfof costumes. They will present the “Swan Lake”
ballet on Friday and on Saturday “highlights from shorter works.”

The company includes 200 peo-
ple, of which 120 are actual
dancers. To become full members
of the Bolshie, dancers must un-
dergo nine years of intensive bal-
let training. They are assisted in
a production by dozens of people,
from scenery artists to‘ shoe-
makers.

Among the new members of
the company is.Yuri Grigorovich,
the chief choreographer. Like
many Western dance masters, his
interests lie with the classical
ballets, ‘ in particular, those of
Petipa and Ivanov, St. Petersburg
choreographers, who worked with
Tschaikowsky’s music. As such,
he has broken with the long-held
Soviet belief that dance must be
a drama, or tell a meaningful
story.

obviously lack a divergency of opinion.

Pittsburgh Uber Alles! ! That dreadful
cry appears to be the theme of the Univer-
sity’s commencement ceremonies scheduled
for June 6. The main speaker is Dr. H. Guy-
ford Stever, president of Carnegie Institute
.;of Technology and the noted men receiving
-honorary degrees are :_ Frank L. Magee,
member of the University’s Board of Trus-
"tees and retired chairman of the board of
the Aluminum Company of America
f(ALCOA) ; William H. Rea, member of the
Board of Trustees and president of the
Pittsburgh School Board; and Dr. _Sidney
P. Marland, superintendent of Pittsburgh
Public Schools.

There is certainly no reason to doubt
.the executive capabilities and contributions
these men have made to the Pittsburgh
Tcommunity. Mssrs. Magee and Rea have
"not only established themselves as promi-
nent businessmen, but have taken an active
interest in community affairs. Drs. Stever
land Marland likewise have contributed to
3' the betterment of our fair city by heading
‘two of the city’s larger educational com-
plexes. Yet, the presence of this entire
fPittsburgh-based group of honoraries does
not serve the betterment of this institution.
.f_I_n fact, it may foreshadow a narrow, com-
’munity-oriented outlook soon to pervade
he University’s administrative hierarchy.

THE UNIVERSITY is substantially con-
-“-trolled by and serves the power in the com-
munity. D. S. Greenberg stated in a series
;in Science, the publication of the American
Association of Science‘, that there has al-
{ways been the idea of this University serv-
'ng the Pittsburgh community. He noted a
rucial distinction in discussing service to
he community during the Litchﬁeld era.
Litchﬁeld and the late Alan M. Scaife, the
board chairman who brought Litchﬁeld
-here, saw service to the comunity as “a by-
{product of the university, not its raison
d’etre,” while Richard K. Mellon‘ saw the
IUniversity primarily as another asset in
regional development. _

‘ With the University making an exerted
ffort to seek a better base in the commun-
ty, grea_.ter_ entrenchment with the city’s
ower elite is inevitable. This elite, current-
y headed by Richard King Mellon, is the
ro11p- dominated by a more utilitarian, not

The problem facing the A1location’s Committee is not re ally their own. The
trouble stems from the inactivity of the Student Affairs Committee (SAC).
- According to the Official Handbook, SAC is supposed to make periodic review of
_recognized student organizations. Because this has not been done in the past, Alloca-
tions Committee is left to determine on its own the general condition of campus g1"011DS-
SAC should be asked by the Allocations Committee to examine the s ta u s of
those groups requesting money. It would be up to SAC to determine. the ﬁnancial condi-
tion of the group, the strength of its membership, and the beneﬁt its activities has for
non-members. Allocations Committee should also be informed if the group has been sub-
.ject to disciplinary action or if it has broken university rules.

Right now Allocations is often wandering -in the dark when it has to judge little
known campus_groups. It is inevitable that Allocations Committee could do a more know-
iledgeable and equitable job if SAC would provide the pI‘0l9€I‘ 1T1f01'Tnat10n-

Political Union -- Yes!

Filling the intellectual gap in student activities at the University is no small job.
But an effective well balanced political Union, like the one suggested by the Allocations

On paper the idea sounds ﬁne, but the way in which the Union plan is being car-
ried out raises some doubts. While it is _best'that a non-partisan group like ‘Omicron Del-
ta Kappa head up the planning, all political g r o u p s on campus should be part of the

At present only the Studentsfor Peace and the International Relations Club are
working with ODK. It seems virtually impossible that any kind of a working solution can
, “be produced without consulting other major campus political organizations such as the
Young Republicans, the Young Democrats, and the Society for Conservative Studies.’
‘There would be no purpose to a Union which did not include them for the "Union would

One of America’ rec:

mencement, as the Honors Convocation with
Dr. William Steinberg, is seemingly design-
ed for the Pittsburgh community, not the
University. While Drs. Stever and Marland
possess ﬁne academic credentials deserving
recognition, their choice seems more geared
to creating an intimate feeling between civ-
ic leaders and the University.

WHILE SUCH A FEELING will be the
basis of the University’s now all-important
community image’, it is not an adequate cri-
its more important academic
image. ast year’s Commencement had a
broader outlook, featuring Sargent Shriver,
then Director of the Office of Economic Op-
portunity, and including honorary degrees
not only to Governor William Scranton, but
United States Senators John Sherman Coop-
er of Kentucky and Jennings Randolph of
West Virginia. ‘

At a time when American education, in
general, and the University, in particular,
are going through a period of unprece-
dented self-analysis, the aura of Pittsburgh
should not hang over a commencement.
With the predominant fears" that. an in-
crease in commuter students and decreases
in out-of-staters will create a narrow. ori-

entation to the Pittsburgh community, a '

strong affirmation by the University to
academic integrity would be a more appro-
priate theme. ‘ ‘

A commencement with a speech geared
to a current educational issue with people
from other geographic and academic areas

would betterserve the school’s academic‘

image. Why not include such people as Fred
Hechinger, education editor of the New

York Times; Dr. James Perkins, president 4-

of Cornell University; Paul Goodman, a
noted social critic and author; or Oregon
Congresswoman Edith Green, chairman of
the House Special Subcommittee on Educa-
tion and prime defender of the NDEA pro-
gram? Why not award an honorary degree

to State Senator Joseph Clark or one of the a

many educational or political personalities
ﬂuent on the Vietnam issue?

_Such a_progam would be important at
this time in the University’s history. Iii-

“State-Relatedness and the Un-

will be Acting Chancellor David
Kurtzman’s topic at the 16th an-
nual Recognition Dinner of the
University’s Institute of Local
Government.

The dinner, honoring some 406
municipal officials who have suc-

training courses conducted by the
Institute, will be held Thursday
at 6:30 p.m. in the Georgian
Room of Hotel Webster Hall.

Each of the officials will re-
ceive a certiﬁcate at the dinner
marking his participation in
courses such as Psychology of Hu-
man Relations, Criminal Law for
Police and Municipal Recreation
and Park Administration. Dr. Jo-
seph A. James, director of the In-

stitute, will preside.

During the 1965-66 academic
year, more than 491 officials from
118 jurisdictions in a ten-country
area of Western Pennsylvania
participated in Institute courses.

in 1944 as part of the University’s

The no-drag shaver.

You might notshift
to 3rd until
you're 17.

Usually 17 is the time peach fuzz turns into hard bristle. Then you've got trouble,
unless you have a shaver that can grow up with you. Like the new REMlNGTON~' 200
Se/ectro Shaver with the dial. Alias no-drag. We gave it an alias because you can
shift all over your face and adjust to your particular beard. Any variety from fuzz to
‘ ' & ' scrub brush. Turn the dial to 1st. You can take off uphill
9 Q9 l_®_,[ on your neck. No drag. in 2nd you can go through a
couple of days’ growth. No pull. in 3rd you can take on anything without leaving skid
marks. Shift to 4th and you're in and out of corners. You drift over tender spots like
your upper lip. 5th is the finishing line. Straight sideburns. In 6th you clean out the
whiskers. The Se/ectro Shaver is up there in the Ferrari class, but we've managed
to make it cost less than a lot of regular shavers. We're not out to take you for a ride.
We also make a complete line of cordless shavers, in case you're interested.

lntramurals
Gather Steam
In Softball

If the ﬁelding is as odd as the
names, this summer’s softball in-
tramurals promise to be anything
but dull. Last week’s scores have
already provided the first indi-
cation.

The highest score of the week
was posted by the Lambda-Eps,
led by Brian Jontow, when they
defeated the Physicists, 23-8. Ed
Eiseman of the Lambda-Eps start-
ed things off with a home run
over the leftﬁeld fense in the
first inning at Trees Field.

Dorm action had the Patriots
downing the Exhibitionist, 12-6.
Joe Curtin and Barry Weinberger
stroked home runs in defeating
the team named after the Ken-
tucky Derby entry, which was
also a loser. I

In other action the Grads out-
scored the MBA “X” team, 13-8.
For the Grads Tom Watson and
Ed Nemeth had home runs.

The other fraternity entry, Phi
Kappa Theta, was also victorious,
downing the MBA “Y” team, 11-
9. John Stack of the Phi Kaps
was the big gun in that game.

The summer intramurals are
divided into three sections, com-
posed of four teams each. After
the teams in each section-play
each other once, they will be re-
grouped and from their records
at ‘the end of the term a double
elimination tournament for the
championship will be set up.

Golfers Put Big Scare
Into State’s Champions

Penn State’s Dave Hambly sunk a 50‘foot chip shot on
the 17th hole to prevent the golfers from scoring one of the
biggest upsets of the Eastern Collegiate golf season.

Hambly’s shoe tied up his match with Jim McKeon,
and also tied up the team match at 31/3-31/2, forcing a play-
off. Hambly then beat McKeon on the ﬁrst extra hole to

give State the match.

Before Hambly’s ﬁnale, the
golf team had pulled some sur-
prises of its own against the East-
ern champions. Bill Baloh upset
Nittany Lions medalist Scott
Yard. Coupled with wins by Dick
Winter and Bill Bryan, Baloh’s
victory set the stage for the best
effort in many years.

In earlier matches this week
the golfers broke even. They de-
feated St. Vincent, 51/2-1]/2, but
lost to Ohio U. by a 91/2-81/2 count.
