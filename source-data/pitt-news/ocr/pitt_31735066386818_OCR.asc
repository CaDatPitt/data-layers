Duality of
God, evil
examined
by speaker

By Robin Senor
Staff Writer

How can God exist alongside
evil?

That was the question raised yes-
terday by Dr. Norman Samuelson
during his lecture, “Judaism and the
Problems of Theodicy.”

Samuelson, a professor of prob-
lems of religion at Temple
University, spoke at Pitt’s Jewish
Studies program’s annual Shalom
lecture yesterday in the William Pitt
Union’s Kurtzman Room.

In his lecture, Samuelson dis-
cussed the issue of theodicy, the
philosophy which attempts to
explain divine power in the pres-
ence of evil. Samuelson said the
theodicy model_ contains three
major assumptions: God is perfectly
good, God is all-powerful and evil
exists.

According to Samuelson, not all
of these assumptions belong
together.

“God can be perfectly powerful
and good [only] if there is no evil,”
Samuelson said. “Adversely, there
can be evil if God has limited
power; therefore, God is not good.”

Samuelson said the interpretation
of the nature of God differs signifi-
cantly with different theologies.

“It depends on what they mean
when they say ‘God is good’ or
‘God is power’ and how the term
‘perfectly’ modifies these aspira-
tions,” he said.

Samuelson added that while God
is “perfectly good,” he is not per-
fectly powerful.

Former lawyer, eX—con discusses
cocaine addiction, law, prison life

By Mark Gordon
Staff Writer

Peny Perrino has experienced
all sides of the criminal—justice
triangle by working as a prose-
cutor, defense attorney, and
serving time in a federal prison.

Perrino was the guest lecturer
at last night’s Lambda Alpha

Epsilon meeting, the
Administration of Justice frater-
nity at Pitt.

Jamie Rakow, a member of
the programming committee of
the fraternity, wanted Perrino to
speak about the challenges of
law school and about some of
the adventures he has traveled
through in his life.

“I heard him speak in Dave
Defazio’s Introduction to Civil
Rights course and I felt what he
talked about was really relevant
to the organization,” Rakow
said.

Perrino graduated from
Duquesne University Law
School in 1983. Soon after, he
got a job at the assistant district
attorney’s office in Pittsburgh.
That is when Perrino’s past
caught up with him.

“At Duquesne, when I was a
first-year law student, that is
when I was introduced to
cocaine,” Perrino said. “Back
then it was debated whether or
not coke was addictive,” he
added.

The need to get cocaine led
Perrino to “get involved with
people I had no business being
around.” Some of those people
were investigated by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and
eventually the crusade led the
FBI to Perrino.

Although not formally
charged with a crime at the
time, Perrino was forced to
resign from the district attor-
ney’s office.

After his resignation, Perrino
took some time off from law
and devoted himself to totally
erasing his cocaine habit.

“I managed to [remove]
myself from the addiction with-

Urban stadiesgronp
strives to help others

ByJ.M. Gonzalez
For The Pitt News

Voter registration, house painting, construction and gar-
dening are not most commonly thought of together but at
Pitt they have a common bond.

The Pitt Urban Studies Association helps the local commu-
nity by spending their time volunteering and participating
with other campus and community organizations in a variety

of volunteer projects.

“It’s an organization designed not only to benefit the
urban studies students academically and socially, but also
those who are less fortunate in the community,” senior
member Maryellen Bahret said. A

In the past, USA has typically done large projects like last
year’s voter registration in the Hill District, but the group also
assists with other community projects such as Pitt Law Cares’

Committee
recommends
waiting on
South A rica
reinvestment

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

Political instability and violence
should keep Pitt from reinyesting in
South Africa, at least for the time
being, according to the Senate
Council’s Committee on Reinvestment
in South Africa.

Committee chair David F.. Epperson,
dean of the School of Social Work,
said in his interim report at yesterday's
Senate Council meeting that nine of
the university groups who were asked
their opinion on reinvestment have
given their positions.

A “The majority of those who have.

been responding to the request are
indicating that investment is important
and it should be done, but that the tim-
ing is quite crucial,” Epperson said at
the Senate Council meeting.

Epperson cited the current political
instability and violence in South Africa
as reasons to hold off on investment,
but said the decision on reinvest-
ment should be made after the April
27-29 national elections in that coun-
try.

“At that time there will be one per-
son, one vote,” lipperson said. “At that
time there will be an identified democ-
ratic process. It will also be a time
where accountability can be identi-
fied.”

He said some people believe that
there is no real accountability at this
point, especially for black Africans.

“Not only should [Pitt] be socially
responsible, but also [ensure] those
who are black activists be in a position
to reap the kind of reinvestment that is
required,” Epperson said.

See Senate, page 2

Senate

Continued from page 1

He said Pitt should also con-
sider the opinion of the 1,500
international representatives
who will be observing the elec-
tion in South Africa.

Epperson recommended that
factors such as violence during
the election must be “minor in
scope” for institutions such as
Pitt to consider reinvestment.

He said that his report is not
final because not all groups
have responded.

In other committee business,
Carolyn Maue presented an
Employee Assistance Program
proposal as it currently works at
the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center and has been
discussed for overall University
use by the Benefits and Welfare
Committee.

“lEAPl are programs of con-
sultation, education, counseling
and referral when employees

are experiencing personal prob-
lems,” Maue said.

She said personal problems
handled by EAP range from
everyday problems to more
serious problems such as
depression.

According to Maue, such a
program helps tolower health
care costs and reduce em-ploy-
ee tardiness and absenteeism.

“Our goal is for this to be a
preventative program,” Maue
said. “We want people to use
the program before they need
to use health care benefits.”

She said the program is '
designed to be totally confiden-

tial as an incentive for employee
use.“Clients’ records are kept
separate from their medical
records,” Maue said.
records are only accessible if
the client signs a release, or by
court order.”

Maue said another incentive

“The,

for employees to seek help is
the fact that the program will be
prepaid by the university.

She cited a study on the EAP
at the McDonnell-Douglas
Corporation which points to sig-
nificantly lower employee
absenteeism and medical costs.

In addition, a study is current-
ly being conducted on the suc-
cess of EAP at UPMC.

Pitt Director of Human
Resources John Wilds said the
proposal still needs to be
approved by senior administra-
tion, but said he hopes EAP ser-
vices will be available to the
university community by June 1.

“We still need to develop
policies and procedures, as well
as establishing an advisory com-
mittee so we can determine pre-
cisely what kind of EAP we
want,” Wilds said.

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis

O’Connor said he was pleased
with the proposal.

“I think John Wilds did a real-
ly good job working with [the
UPMC programl,” O’Connor
said. “The program is long over-
due.” A

ness:

project “Paint Your Heart Out”
last fall.

The volunteers for “Paint
Your Heart Out” paint houses in
the area for owners who cannot
afford it themselves.

Another project with which
USA has been involved is
Habitat for Humanity. The
group built houses for the poor
in cooperation with Carnegie
Mellon University and local
church groups. This year, they
helped rebuild houses in
Braddock.

“l\VOrking with the Urban
Studies Association is] always a
positive experience when peo-
ple help out,” said A] Schubert,
executive director Of Habitat For
Humanity about Pitt’s Urban
Studies Association.

“Anytime you see college stu-
dents, it’s a good sign. Having
students on a building [project]
brings a level Of energy to the
site,” he said.

USA gets involved with many
projects, according to the
group’s president, Pitt senior
Anjalai Pai.

Every month there is usually a
different project, unless some-
one wants to do more outside
of the group.

Activities such as working at
soup kitchens and recycling
project occur throughout the
term on a regular basis.

Pai said one recycling project
the group participated in was

 

“Planting in the Park,” where
USA members planted bulbs in
a local neighborhood.

The next project approaching
is the Sojourner House, a
halfway house for women who
are recovering alcoholics.

The center is unique because
it allows the women to live with
their children, whereas in other
centers they cannot be to-
gether. Members Of the group
provide care to the children two
days a week.

“People are generally excited
to work with college students.
It’s just a way to get in touch
with the community,” Pai said.
“You get to work with people
firsthand.”

Pai has been involved in the
USA for the past four years.

The group began about -eight
years ago when it was created
by graduate students studying
in the Urban Studies depart-
ment.

Now the organization, which
is comprised mostly of urban
studies majors, remains small
and relatively unknown.

“I think it’s a great organiza-
tion to be in. because Vou are

helping people Out who need it

landl are often forgotten,” senior

member Melissa Sarkis said.

national program, which is

People usually don ’t think about it.
If people see how easy [volunteer-

ing] is, more people would do it.

—Anjalai Pai

the projects is communicated
verbally between group mem-
bers, which may be one reason
for the small number, but the
reason students dOn’t join is not
student apathy, according to
Pai. ’

“People usually dOn’t think
about it. If people see how easy
[volunteering] is, more people
would do it,” said Pai. “NO mat-
ter what [the projectl is, it’s usu-
ally fun.”

Pai said that one exciting
event is attending the Urban
Affairs conference.

Every year the group spon-

The USA “also provides
opportunities for Pitt under-
graduate students such as in
employment and in education,”
Bahret said, referring to the abil-
ity to attend the Urban Affairs
conference.

The group was formed in the
interest of Urban Studies majors
who need volunteer experience
for the major.

The major in itself is small
and may be obscure to some
people, according to Pai.

The major requires an intern-

ship that can be done down-
town in a mayoral Or legislatOr’s
office, in public housing Or any-
where in the world. Pal said she
interned in Singapore.

According to Pai, when you
enter the major, you become a
“student of the city" and can
concentrate in three main cate-
gories: community organizing.
which is similar to social work;
urban management, involving
policy and planning; and plan-
ning, which includes city devel-
opment in areas of archi-
tecture and historical preserva-
tion.

Pai said even though the
majority of the students
involved in the projects are in
the Urban Studies major, any
student can join.

Besides giving valuable
resume experience, volunteer-
ing allows you to interact with
different people and have fun in
helping others.

“You get a feeling of accom-
plishment lrom putting some-
thing back into the community,”
Pai said.

out the help of any treatment
center,” Perrino said.

Perrino turned to the other
side of criminal law, defense,
for his next career stop. He
started working in a private
practice in Pittsburgh with
another former assistant district
attorney.

Soon after starting his prac-
tice, Perrino was appointed by a
Pittsburgh judge to defend
Darlene Scarborough, a woman
accused of beating her 23-
month-old daughter to death.

“She was charged with the
same crime that her husband
was already convicted of,”
Perrino said.

Perrino said he was cer-
tain Darlene had beaten her
daughter but was convinced
that “she did not land the fatal
blow.”

Two days into the trial, during
the middle of a Perrino’s cross-
examination, the FBI entered
the courtroom and finally arrest-
ed him on charges related to his
former cocaine usage.

According to Perrino, a
shocked courtroom looked on
as the judge declared a mistrial.

During his lecture at Pitt, a
bitter Perrino warned the audi-

ence that “when an [FBI] indict-
ment comes down, it’s a done
deal.”

“The conviction rate is some-
where between 96 and 98
percent for the feds,” Perrino
said.

The lawyer that took over the
Scarborough case for Perrino
was Defazio, a Pitt Graduate
School of Public and
International Affairs professor
who had invited Perrino to
speak with his class recently.

Defazio charged the prosecu-
tion with misconduct, claiming
they knew that the FBI was
going to arrest Perrino in the
middle of the trial, causing a
mistrial. .

Defazio subpoenaed the U.S.
Attorney to prove this, a move
that Perrino said was “the bold-
est thing I have ever seen an
attorney do.”

The tactic worked.
Scarborough was convicted, but
sentenced to only six months.

After the indictments, Perrino
was convicted and sentenced to
10 years in prison.

He served three years and
four months of that sentence, an
experience he survived with “:1
lot of luck” and a strong
willpower.

Samuelson. “All state-

Dr. Alexander Orbach

the lecture to be quite
worthwhile.

“I thought it was very

Mental health serious issue

At this month’s Senate Council "meeting, Carolyn
Maue presented a plan entitled the Employee
Assistance Program to address mental-health con-
cerns. The plan is currently in use at the University

of Pittsburgh Medical Center and is being considered

for use by the Benefits and Welfare Committee.

The program is designed to help university
employees when they are experiencing varied per-
sonal problems. They handle counseling, education,
and any needed referral to other programs. The
problems can range from everyday problems to seri-
ous problems including depression.

The plan for the program is to use it to provide
preventative mental-health care. This will lower not
only health care costs, but also absenteeism and
employee tardiness. The Employee Assistance
Program will be confidential to encourage employ-
ees to make use of it. The only way records will be
made available to anyone besides the patients and
their doctors will be if the patient signs a release
form or under court order. The records will be kept
separate from the regular medical records.

Director of the University of Pittsburgh’s Human

‘Resources Department John Wilds said that he hopes

to have the plan up-and-running by the first of June.

The university is to be commended for recognizing
that mental illness is a serious issue. Often, people
don’t immediately realize that certain problems
denote mental illness or that their problems Can be
alleviated through counseling or treatment.
Hopefully, the acceptance of this proposal will fur-
ther the understanding of mental-‘health issues on
campus. . .

We hope that the university takes this into account
when they are planning their budget next year. In
addition to the mental-health concerns of the faculty,
they should remember that the students also share

‘these concerns.

Although counselors are available to students
through the Pitt Counseling Center, there is a waiting
list and students may not receive help when they
need it. If the university is sincere about recognizing
mental health as an important concern facing stu-
dents, they must. consider allocating more money to
provide more counselors not only for faculty, but
also for stu'dents.iIf they cannot provide additional
counseling facilities, they should at leastnot cut the
services and faculty of the current system.

Mental illness is a health problem, not something
individuals must work out for themselves, and
should be taken as seriously as any other medical
condition. '

As you make your way across
the campus today, take time to
think about these few scenar-
iOS:

Imagine for a moment being
blind: During the day you
would move about the streets
“seeing? through your cane.
Now try to do so amid previous
weeks’ weather, snowdrifts and
sheets of ice everywhere. For
the sighted it was annoying, but
for the blind it was dangerous.

For the wheelchair bound it
was not much better. Many of
the handicapped—access curbs
were either COmpl€t€ly\ covered
in snow or were blocked by
snowdrifts from the cleared
streets. Wheelchairs were not
designed to travel through any-
thing but the smallest of snow-
falls. One individual in particu-
lar was forced to travel from the
Cathedral of Learning into the
Towers by way of Bouquet

Street in the sub—zero tempera— ,

tures. Why? Because_that’s
where the only ramp is.
Imagine having to wait for a
specially-equipped van every
day to take you to classes in
buildings such as Chevron or
Alumni: Then imagine having
to spend 20 or 30 minutes in
the Van circling the building
because some idiotparked ille-
gally in the handicapped zone.
These vans are limited as to
where they can or cannot
unload students because of the
ramps which must be extended.

This letter is in response to Bethany Wurst’s
letter (The Pitt News, Feb. 2). Bethany, your letter
is a prime example of how pro-lifers try to
impose their individual morals on the rest of
society. How could you possibly say that the res-
cuers aren’t trying to take away anyone’s choice?
They are trying to stop women from making their

own decisions!

If you believe that life begins at conception, I
can respect that. However, I am not required to
have your debatable belief forced upon _me by
any laws, protests or verbal lashings. You must
respect my belief that life does not begin at con-

ception — and let freedom ring.

The rescuers do try to stop freedom of choice
by the tactics they-use. You claim that they are
“asking people to make the choice not to.have a

Now imagine waking up in
the middle of the night  it’s
the fire alarm. You get in your
wheelchair and go out into the
hall. Smoke is everywhere.
Everyone else is running down
the stairs, but you can’t. The
elevators aren’t operating.
You’re stuck in the building.

Finally, if you think that your
Saturday nights arerough
because Zelda’s is carding or
the Lambda Sigma Deltas don’t
have you on their party list,
imagine not being able to phys-
ically get into a place, much
less legally. 0

As a staff writer for The Pi1.‘t

positive contributions that stu-
dent groups have made for var-
ious causes. It would be nice to
see some of these groups work-
ing together for a change,
instead of spending so ‘much
time in-fighting with each other

of the handicapped -community
are black and white, male and

exist in every socially distinctive

If you have time, volunteer to

are just a few of the positions

the handicapped with their day-

organizations such as the

Snoopy, take to

Every Saturday, my mom
would make us a special break-
fast to “celebrate” the coming
of the cartoons. We would
watch Looney Toons for what
seemed" like forever, but we
didn’t mind. It was an occasion,

something we looked forward

to at the end of a long week at
school.

Saturday cartoons aren’t what
they used to be. In fact, car-
toons aren’t what they used to
be. Now Batman graces the
after-sch.ool TV programs with
graphic violence. Cartoons
have always been violent, Wile
E. Coyote got splattered
enough in his day, but the vio-

--lence is different. It isn’t Three F

Stooges slapstick. It’s more like
new-age technology involving
mass destruction.

Not to stray too far from the
point, but watching Desert

Storm was not unlike watching

)(-Men, or a seven-year-old
playing Nintendo. D

What exactly, then, is the
point? Well, I could be Oliver

Stone-paranoid and say that it’s
all part of a master plan some
secret group in the United
Nations has dreamed up, mak-
ing our children watch war-like
cartoons, play war video games
and creating a bunch of violent
clones walking around waiting
for the first shot.

Or maybe the kids are pick-
ing it up from us. Maybe we’re
the violent ones, and produc-
tion is simply feeding it to our
kids. Could it be that we’re all
time ‘bombs waiting to go off?
But then, where. did it come
from? '

I suppose we’ve been violent
from the start, and perhaps it’s
peace that"s abnormal.

I’m not going to get on my
soapbox and begin to shout
about how we all need to “give
peace a chance” (although the
thought has crossed my mind).

No, this is something that we,

need to want to do. No one
can tell us to stop being vio-
lent, it has to start with each of
us. (I don’t know about you,

like air again; we need you

but I don’t want to be the one
to tell some person with a
machete that they should be
nice, and put the knife down,
or your mommy will be very
upset.)

Maybe I’m simply too old to
appreciate our kids. A senior
citizen at age nineteen.
(Somehow I don’t think our
government would appreciate
my application for social secu-

rity.) Maybe Bugs Bunny,
Winnie the Pooh, Papa Smurf
and Mickey Mouse arefruly
dead. This is Mario’s, Batman’s
and those X-Men’s (whomever
they are) day in the artificial
sun. Maybe these kids will turn
out all right, and I’m being a
fool.

But yet, when -I see cartoon

THE PITT NEWS, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1994

characters blowing each other
away with 21st century laser
guns, well, I can’t help think-
ing, “What happened to the
Smurfs?” (Hey, as dumb as they
were, they were damn cute.)
And the grownups, what are
they doing?‘ Why, they’re com-
plaining about girls not having
a Super Mario-ette to blow up
(although that is a good point).
They’re feeding the industry
millions of dollars each year so
they can make more, yet these
people keep saying, “Kids
today, they’re so violent, we
were never like that.” Well,
while you guys had your Red
Rider bb guns, kids now have
their supersonic laser pistol
with night vision and radar
(batteries not included). Ahem.
I wouldn’t be a bit surprised
if a 5 year old saw the L.A. riots
a few years ago and said, “Hey,

_Mommy, do you think Santa

will bring me that game for
Christmas?” or “When will those
people get out their lasers and
fly off the buildings like

 

to save the kids

Batman?”

People need to realize how
impressionable kids can be. We
need Fred and Barney to take
the reins again. Where are
George Jetson and his boy
Elroy when you need them?
Charlie Brown needs to miss
that football a few more times,
and the World War I ﬂying ace,
the Red Baron, needs to fly
again.

We should persuade Fred
Rogers to run for public office.
He’d clean up the neighbor-
hood. With Big Bird as his run-
ning mate, and Lambchop as
Secretary of State, we’d be in
business.

Perhaps that was a bit
extreme, but it’s something to
think about.)

I truly miss my Saturday car-g

toons. Kids need some quality
TV. They need their Crayola 64
packs (well, we could all use
those). Kids need to be kids.

Abortion Control Act targets Women and minorities with counseling rules

Becky Bell, a 17 year old from Indiana, died a
painful death due to infections from the illegal abor-

‘ tion she received. If you think she had the abortion

before Roe L’. Wade was enacted (before abortion was
made legal), you are very wrong.

According to the Feminist Majority Fund, Becky
(lied after 1990, when PL-106, Indiana’s parental con-
sent bill, was put into law. More than 30 states have
passed parental consent and notification laws which
force women under 18 years of age to get a parent’s
permission before they are able to receive a safe, legal
abortion. Feeling that she could not talk to her parents
about her pregnancy, Becky was one of the first vic-
tims of PL-106.

By no means was she the last.Pennsylvania is now
about to enact a set of laws that will do the exact
same thing. It’s called the Abortion Control Act, and its
purpose is to clamp down on the accessibility of abor-
tion to young women and poor women, two of the
most vulnerable sectors of our society.

Besides forcing women under 18 to get a parent’s
consent, the Abortion Control Act will force every
woman seeking an abortion to take a 24-hour waiting
period after being given “abortion counseling.”
According to Planned Parenthood, which routinely
~gives both pre- and post-,al)0r‘tion counseling, this
“counseling” is not the traditional counseling a woman

-normally receives before having an abortion, but is a

govemment-mandated lecture which will use materials
provided by the state. Even if a-woman has made an
informed decision to have an abortion, she will be
denied the procedure until she listens to the mandated
material.

- The offensive, underlying implication to this law is
that women of all ages, classes, colors and income lev-
els lack the intelligence to make their own persona_l
decisions and that women must be forced into being
"counseled” because they are- obviously going to make
this important decision on a whim, giving it no fore-

thought whatsoever.

Counseling a woman about the decision to termi-
nate her pregnancy is obviously very important and is
available to be given to all who want it. The idea of
forced counseling, however, is insulting and degrading
to all women, especially those who have already made
informed, intelligent decisions.

-Furthermore, this part of the Abortion Control Act
directly targets poor women. Here’s how: under this
law, a woman seeking an abortion is required to go to
a clinic to receive “counseling” on her decision, then
is forced to wait 24 hours to “think it over” (again,
even if she has already made her decision).

Only after this 24-hour period is she permitted to
have the procedure done, which means she must

Rachel Barrett

make two trips to the clinic in order to do so.Given
-the indisputable fact that abortion clinics are not readi-
ly accessible to all women (as a matter of fact, accord-
ing to Planned Parenthood, only three counties out of
the 67 in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvaniaghave

abortion providers), it is imperative to consider this D

law’s false. and thoughtless assumptions.

I False Assumption No. 1: If a woman must travel a
long-distance to receive abortion services, she will eas-
ily be able to take a two-day leave from her job(s).
Sure, she may be supporting three children and pay-
ing her rent with every last penny she receives from
the two jobs she is working, but that’s OK. She doesn’t
really need those two days worth of pay. Oh, and her
boss will understand perfectly.

, False Assumption No. 2: Every woman seeking an
abortion has access to a car and money to fuel it. Hell,

she”d better have gas money — she could be driving
more than eight hours each way. Twice. But if she
doesn’t want to drive home after her “counseling,”
surely she has the money to stay in a hotel, right?
False Assumption No. 3: A woman who is seeking
an abortion and has children obviously has alhusband
who is able to look after them, or unlimited access to
child care in order that her children are not left alone

' when their mother must be away for two days in

order to have an abortion.

False Assumption No. 4: Women presently have no
problem entering and exiting abortion clinics. There
are no protestors, picketers or screaming religious
zealots who block the path of,‘and harass, every
woman on the sidewalk, régardléss at 6viiétliér= glié is:
going into the clinic or not.

So, what could be the problem with women having

to enter the clinic twice?

Perhaps this assumption can be translated into say-
ing: if a woman wants an abortion bad enough, she
should be willing to put up with the harassment in
order to get one.

I am a pro—choice escort and have seen first hand
the anti-choicers physically block and hound these
women, myself and other escorts.

I shudder to think that women are soon going to be

forced to endure this mob scene twice. The protestors,
of course, will be more severe than usual in their
attempts to frighten women into not coming back to
have the abortion.
. We are living in the 19905 and it sickens and terrifies
me that even today, deadly laws like these are costing
women their lives by pushing society back to an age
of dangerous, back—alley abortions. »

The Abortion Control Act will be passed any day in ,

Pennsylvania. How many Pennsylvania women will
now have to die? .

hours before the Lambda Chis were

the poster did not, by far, symbolize the

this poster was no different from the
front pages of women’s magazines like
Cosmopolitan, Mademoiselle and

Glamour which line magazine shelves in

fraternities to lose the keg and adopt
strict drinking policies? Evidently not, or

posters “Another Drop in the Keg.”

I understand that the IFC is trying to
change their image of being a meat mar-
ket, but changing their image will never
be enough because anyone who goes to
a frat party knows that that is exactly
what it is. However, not every fraternity
should be judged equally with the oth-
ers. The brothers of Lambda Chi Alpha
are probably some of the nicest guys on
campus, and they do not deserve to be
treated this unfairly.

Women swim split double meet, beat Kenyon

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s swimming
and diving team continued their
stretch run to the Big East
Championship meet with a dou-
ble dual meet in Athens, Ohio
last Friday.

The Pitt women (6-4) split the
double meet, beating Kenyon
College 149-95 and losing to
Ohio University 146-99.

All three teams swam at the
same time, but the meet was
scored as if there were three
separate meets.

“It was a weird meet,” rookie
Kara Crombie said. “There were
nine lanes and just so many
people swimming.”

While the format of the meet
was a little strange, going into
the meet the women knew what
to expect. ,

“We knew we were going to
lose to Ohio U.,” junior Christy
Knobloch said. “They’re a lot
like Penn State. They have

strong swimmers and they’re a
deep team.”

“Our goal was to beat
Kenyon,” said Crombie.

Head coach Marian Cassidy
seemed satisﬁed with the split.

“Considering that we’re at the
part of our season where were
beginning the rest phase, the
girls swam really well,” Cassidy
said.

“Our races just weren’t as
sharp as they could have been.”

Contrary to their coach’s
remarks, a couple of Pitt swim-
mers were as sharp as they’d
ever been. Senior Jen Burns fin-
ished with two lifetime best
swims. The first was in the 100-
yard freestyle, where she fin-
ished first beating competitors
from both Ohio and Kenyon.
Her other best was in an event
she recently started swimming,
the 2QO-yard freestyle. She fin-
ished second to an Ohio swim-
mer, but beat all Kenyon
entries.

_”“I’m getting a lot more used to

it now,” Burns said of the 200
free. "I’m comfortable with it.”

The other Pitt sharpswimmer
was Crombie. She beat all other
swimmers in the 200-yard back-
stroke with a lifetime best
2:07.98 — two seconds faster
than the closest finisher. She
had a theory as to why she
swam so fast.

“I liked the pool,” Crombie
said. “Usually pools are really
cold, this was a warm pool.”

The only other Pitt swimmer
to sweep first place in both
events was sophomore Jenny
Doran. She won the 200-yard
butterﬂy.

The Panthers also swept the
last event of the meet, with
Burns, Crombie, junior Vicki
Geubtner and sophomore Alicia
Tymes combining to win the
400-yard freestyle relay.

Pitt divers junior Kara Sixbury
and sophomore Sunday
Lewandowski swept both of the
diving events. In the one-meter
diving, Sixbury finished first

with Lewandowski second. In
the three—meter the results were
reversed, with Lewandowski
winning and Sixbury diving sec-
ond.

This was the last away meet
of the season for the Panthers.
They swim against Duquesne
on Saturday. But make no mis-
take, when Cassidy speaks of a
rest phase, it’s not in prepara-

tion for Duquesne. The
Panthers are beginning their
taper for the Big East

Championships coming up at
the end of February.

During the season, the
Panthers have been practicing
six days a week with three or
four morning practices on top
of that. They’ve been swimming
through their meets. In other
words, they haven’t rested for
their dual meets. Cassidy has
talked repeatedly during the
season about how her swim-
mers have had to learn to swim
fast, even though they were
tired in their meets.

State divers finishing sec-
ond, third and fourth.

That’s how most of the
meet went — with Ohio
State finishing at the top
of all of the events.

Knoles pointed out pos-
itives in the defeat.

“We swam reasonably
well,” Knoles said. “They
were close races —
they’re just a better team
than us.”

‘ “It was a good meet for
us,” assistant coach David
Amato said. “We had
good times and showed
signs of getting a step
closer to their level. It was
a good experience to race
against someone that

high.”

The team of Eric Stull,
Economos, Sami
Vartiainen and Jonti

Bacharach placed second
in the 200-yard freestyle
relay.

The swimming and div-
ing team tasted the sour
on Thursday, then it was

time for them to indulge L

in the sweet against
weaker competition on
Friday.

“It was a nice meet,”
Knoles said. “It was a fair-
ly easy win. We started
off pretty shaky. We used
a weaker lineup, but we
changed it around and
ended pretty
well.”

“The guys could relax a

A little more against them,”

Amato said.

To start off the meet,
Pitt mixed up their lineup
in the 400—yard i.m. relay.
The team of Chris Balke,
Sunseri, Jeff Novotny and
Vartiainen finished sec-
ond.

Then Pitt started to
dominate.

In the next event, the
1,000—yard freestyle, Sam
Dommel won and Gary
Mule placed second.

Dommel also went on

to win the 500-yard
freestyle with Mule in
third.

Vartiainen provided
some personal highlights
by breaking his lifetime =
and season best time in
the 100-yard freestyle and
winning the event.

Perry did the same,
breaking his lifetime and
season best time in the
200-yard breaststroke.
Perry also won the 200-
yard i.m., with Heynes
I ﬁnishing fourth.

was a two-year starter for the
Yellow Jackets while he aver-
aged 10 points per game at
small forward.

However, he and the coach
did not see eye to eye. He
described basketball at
Waynesburg as a “difficult situ-
ation.”

“Basketball wasn’t fun any-
more,” Koontz said. “I had to
get out of there.”

So Koontz transferred to Pitt,
where his brother had attend-
ed, to pursue a degree as a
mechanical engineer.
Academics were his first priori-
ty, and he had no thoughts of
playing basketball.

Koontz spent a lot of time
playing ball at Trees Gym, and
like fellow walk-on Derek
Jones, began to earn respect
for his abilities on the
court.

“A few guys said I should
give [walking on] a shot,” he
said.

But when former Pitt stars
Curtis Aiken and Demetrius
Gore suggested that he try,
that was all he needed to
heat

‘‘ “They said the worst you

caught the eye of Coach
Evans.

“He saw me all the time,”
Koontz said. “In fact, he
probably got sick of seeing
me.

“I played three or four hours
a day all summer,” Koontz
added.

"[Paul Evans] saw me all the

time. In fact,

he probably

got sick of seeing me."
— Shaun Koontz

can do is not make it,” Koontz
said. “At least in my mind I
knew that I would have
tried.” .

His play in the pick-up
games over the summer

“I also conditioned ‘myself
with the help of Pat
CaVanaugh.”

Koontz made the team and
proved to himself that he
could play at the Division I

79

level. But the process of walk-
ing on was not
easy.

“It was challenging,” he said.
“The most difficult part was
the higher level of competition
that I had to face.

“You have to earn your
respect,” he said,

“And you have to play with
confidence.”

Besides the physical aspects
of playing ball, Koontz has
found that the academic part is
just as challenging.

“We travel so much that it’s
hard for me to keep up with
my work.” he said,

“But this is something I’ve
always dreamed of, and I’m
willing to make my sacrifices
to play ball.” '

To prove himself and play
ball — nothing else could
make Shaun Koontz
happier.

boards. Jeremy McClean came
in second on the one-meter and
Steve Wolfe in third on the
three—meter board.

Then Balke proceeded to win
the 200-yard backstroke with
Bacharach taking second.

In the 200-yard freestyle, Stull
and Sunseri finished two and
three respectively.

Pitt finished strong in the ﬁnal
event, the 400—yard freestyle
relay as the combination of
David Williams, Ryan Bair,
Economos and Perry won the
race.

SPLISHES AND SPLASHES:
The men’s swimming and div-
ing team will swim their final
home meet of the season
against Duquesne University at
Trees Hall on Saturday at 1 pm.
It will be senior recognition day,
as the Panthers prepare to chase
their 11th Big East

Championship in 12 years.

ond place finish with a
time of 4216.7.

“He had a great meet,”
head coach John Vasvary
said. “He is one of our
mainstays. It was good to
get him going again. He
gives us great strength in
the distance areas.

In other events, Jay
Murphy took a disap-
pointing third—place finish
in the 55-meter hurdles
with 7.51 seconds.

“I was a bit upset,”
Murphy said. “I wasn’t
focused. I.couldn’t get my
mind on the race.”

Jones

Continued from page 7
Jones said.

“People kept telling me that I
should try out for the team. I
did, and I made it.”

But don’t think that making
the team was easy. Competing
with scholarship players and
other prospective walk-ons was
a trying task.

“It was difficult,” he said. “The
conditioning was hard. I played
ball every day and ran during
the summer.”

Not only did Jones have to get
in shape, but he had to change
positions.

“In high school I was a center,
and here I’m a guard.” Jones
said.

“I really had to work on my
shooting and improve my range
on my jump shot.”

But the hard work that he
went ‘through didn’t seem to
bother him.

I’m not afraid of hard work. I

had something to prove,” he
said.

“I proved that I could play at
the college level.”

Jones’ accomplishment did
not get overlooked by his fami-
ly.

“My mom and dad couldn’t
believe that I made the team,”
he said.

“My dad swaggered around
with his chest out. My mom was
in disbelief. They were more
excited than I was.”

Although Jones has only
appeared in three games this
season, he is not discouraged.

“I knew beforehand that it
would be hard to walk on,” he
said.

“I knew it would even be
harder to play.”

But statistics can be deceiv-
ing. He brings more to the team
than just an occasional bucket. ’

He adds spirit and enthusiasm
from the depths of the bench.

The towe1—waving does not
go unnoticed by his teammates.

“Derek is not just a player
who works hard,” said senior
guard Ahmad Shareef.

“He gets us pumped up from
the bench whether we’re win-
ning or losing. You need one of
those type of guys on the team
to keep us going during the
game.”

"I have to do what I can to
help the team,” Jones said.

His charismatic personality is
also appreciated by the fans.

At the end of the Miami game,
the Field House erupted in a
“Jones” chant that culminated
with Derek entering the game

 J against the ‘Canes.

“That makes me feel good,”
he said.

“I’m glad that the fans appre-
ciate me.”

In the meantime, Jones will
keep doing anything and every-
thing to help the team.

In the Panther victory against
Villanova, he helped carry
injured teammate Orlando
Antigua off the court.

“As long as it will benefit the
team, I’ll do it," he said.

All he’s waiting for is the
opportunity to contribute, in
any way he can.

“I’m waiting for my chance,”
he said. “It may or may not
come.”

For now, he will continue to
wave the towel and cheer his
teammates to victory, but deep
down he is waiting for one
thing — that chance.
