Thousands
of pro-lifers
join to form
human chain

By David T. Welch

and Skip Leezer
The Pitt News

Several thousand pro-life activists lined
local streets in an effort to form a “human
chain” from Oakland to Wilkinsburg
yesterday.

The activists covered both sides of Forbes
and Fifth avenues, ﬂashing signs that read
“Abortion Kills Children” and “Jesus
Forgives All” at passing motorists. Similar
events occurred in 350 other cities around
the country, according to event coordinator
Steve Smith.

“We counted 4,600 people [in Pittsburgh]
at 2 o’clock, and there were more people
coming after that,” Smith said.

The event was coordinated by Life Chain,
a national pro-life coalition. Forty-four
pro-life organizations and 180 churches
were represented in the Pittsburgh chain,
according to Smith.

“Forty pastors signed a letter endorsing
the event,” Smith said. “The two things
that the churches agreed upon was that
abortion takes a child’s life [and] that the
church Christ founded opposed child
killing,” Smith said.

Rev. Jay Passavant of the North Way
Christian Group said that his group “is
committed to helping those in crisis
pregnancy by funding, referral,
adoption” and other means available to
them.

Passavant said that while the pro-life
groups can protest, “the only one thing
that’s going to changevanything is the
legislature.”

Smith said he opposed abortion in all
circumstances, including incest and rape.

“In rape, why should the child be killed
because the conception was socially
unacceptable? Once she’s been violated
we can’t give back what’s been taken from
her. The child could be the only good
thing to come from that despicable act.
She could put it up for adoption,” Smith
said.

perpetrated that wants to hide everything.
Once you’ve killed that child, you have
helped him conceal [the actl,” Smith
said. ‘

There is no justification for abortion,
according to Audrey Brown of Sheridan.

amidst cheers, spotlights and pompons
for a pep rally to support the undefeated

Pitt cheerleaders kicked off the event
with a few chants, led by squad member

Pitt police nab
alleged robber

By Skip Leezer
Staﬁ" Writer

At approximately 1 a.m. Sunday momin g,
two males were physically assaulted and
robbed by three males while walking on
North Dithridge Street in North Oakland.

One of the alleged attackers, Carlos
Smith, was later chased by students into
the Gulf station on the corner of Bayard
and North Craig streets, where he was
apprehended and detained by a university
policeman until city police arrived.

Smith was charged with robbery,
recklessly endangering another person
and open lewdness.

One of the victims received cuts to his
neck and bruises to his body. -The other
received only minor bruises.

The victims wereivisiting two female
friends at Pitt. The Pitt News does not
identify by name victims of crimes.

According to one of the women, three
men assaulted the group as they walked
up Dithridge St. They said the attackers
then punched the victims to‘ the ground

while reaching through their pockets and .

demanding their money and wallets.
Finding that one of the victims had

‘neither a wallet nor money on him, the

attackers then assaulted them them with a
wave of kicks. Smith then urinated on one
of the victims, according to the report.

The two women were able to ﬁnd help
at a fraternity house near the incident.
Members of a second traternity, alerted by
two other witnesses, summoned police.

According to Tony Guazzo,‘ he and Jay
Hong took off down the street after hearing
the women’s pleas for help. Another
brother, Adam Brock, was sent into the
house to get more help. ,

Hong said he saw the men kicking the
two victims on the ground.

Running down the street and screaming ‘

at the men, Guazzo said that all but Smith
ran away immediately. Seeing the two
men, Smith then moved away from the
victim and allegedly pulled a switch blade
on Hong and himself, Guazzo said.

According to Hong, Smith started waving
the knife in the air at them and making
threatening remarks. '

“I backed off a little bit,” Guazzo said.f‘I
wasn’t about to get stabbed.” ‘

Smith then ﬂed down Dithridge and ran
through a yard, but he was stalled jumping
a fence in the yard.

MOUt8iCl6limS advertising promotes exploitation of women

By Rebecca Wilkins
Staff Writer

Advertising plays a crucial role
in the promotion of gender
stereotypes and in the exploitation
of women, according to the movie
Still Killing Us Softly.

“The whole concept in general
is dangerous, and it teaches us
something about women’s place
in our society. We need to get

away from that whole way of
thinking about women,” saidjanet
Stocks, a Ph.D. sociology student
at Pitt who led the post-movie
discussion.

The film, shown Sunday night
at Pitt, is a talk about advertising’s
image of women given by Dr.
Jean Kilbourne in 1987 at Harvard
University. Kilbourne focuses on
the mythological world of

_advertising_ and how it negatively ,

affects men, women and children.

“Women’s bodies get used all
the time to sell things that have
nothing to do with women’s
bodies,” Stocks said.

She cited liquor and cigarette
billboards as particularly offensive
and irrelevant uses of the female
body in advertising. 4

Stocks said that even people
who recognize the danger of
advertisements can be affected

 

by them.

“With the volume of images
that we are bombarded with, it’s
hard to have them not affect us at
an unconscious level," she said.

_ Stocks believes that advertising
negatively affects both men and
women. .

“The way it affects women is it
gives us a specific image to aspire
to. Very few people have the
flawless bodies and faces that are

 

airbrushed into advertisements,
but that’s the image shown to us
as the desired image, so we spend
a lot of time and money trying to
achieve it,” she said.

“It feeds men the concept of
women as objects instead of
women as subjects,” Stocks said.

president of Pitt's Campus_

Women’s Organization, this

Brutus said.

Pitt wo 7*/esb op series oﬂers
chance to share problems

By Jeff S.‘ Griffin
Sta_[f Writer

If getting a paper done on time or breaking off an ailing
relationship has your life temporarily derailed, help is available
through a series of workshops sponsored by the Pitt Counseling
Center.

“The workshops offer, in a nicely packaged format, a chance
to meet people with similar concerns, to share in a non-
threatening atmosphere and to learn new skills,” said Jillian
Ballantyne, the project’s coordinator.

The series includes two—hour sessions on topics ranging from
shyness to personal achievement. Workshopswill be held in
room 944 of the William Pitt Union and led by the center's staff,
interns, and graduate students.

Ballantyne said she believes students are more willing to
participate in one-time workshops than on-going therapy.

“The workshops don’t carry the stigma of therapy," she said.
“Students can get their feet wet through the workshop and feel
like they’re getting something out of it immediately because
that’s how the workshops are designed.”

Because the workshops are pro—active, Ballantyne said students
can learn new skills before their problems become serious.

“The workshops are preventative in scope,” she said. “They
provide students with skill—bui1ding experiences that prevent
them from making the same mistakes over and over again."

The workshops are separated into two modules: Healthy
Relationships and Unlimited Success.

The next workshop, ”Sayin g Hello,” scheduled for Oct. 9 from
1 — 3 p.m., focuses on shyness and will be led by Dr. ‘Carol
Eikleberry and Matt Torres.

“Saying Hello’ provides info on what shyness is and isn’t, as
well as strategies for decreasing social awkwardness and
improving confidence when meeting people,” Eikleberry said.

Participants in the workshop, “When Conflict Occurs,” will
learn skills that enable them to become more comfortable with
confrontation within their relationships, said workshop leaders
Paula McCommons and Lisa Altman. It will be held on Oct. 17
from 2 - 4 p.m.

The last workshop in the I-lealthy Relationship Module,
“Saying Goodbye,” scheduled for Oct. 28 from 1 — 3 p.m., will
focus on ending a relationship on good terms with your partner.
The workshop leaders are Dr. Penny Crary and Teddy Fakles.

ROTC learns survival techniques

By Gary Knapick
Slaﬂ Writer

By the time the average Pitt
student awoke and stumbled to
the cafeteria for Saturday brunch
last weekend, two busloads of
cadets from the Pitt/Carnegie
Mellon detachment of the Reserve
Officer Training Corps were
already rappelling a 60-foot rock
face, moving people and supplies
via a suspension traverse and
assaulting enemy gun
emplacements in the mountains
su rrounding Morgantown, W.Va.

Don’t worry. There wasn’t an
invasion.

Grueling physical activities and
practical survival seminars were
all part of the fun for Pitt and CM
students attending their first ﬁeld
training exercise of the school
year.

While Saturday’s exercise
provided a more relaxed version
of authentic military training,

. cadets still had to stay on their
toes. V

“You’re always being
-evaluated,” public—relations
officer Morgan Marietta said.

Eric Gropp, officer of civil
affairs and recruiting, said that
the focus of the exercise was on

the retention of basic military

skills.
“T here’s only so mu ch you can
teach in the classroom,” Gropp

 

said.

Learning what was described
as “an age-old technique of
traversing obstacles,” cadets
watched as Capt. Mark Fields
demonstrated the correct and
incorrect ways to rappel a rock
cliff.

When the cadets’ turn came,
feelings among the group ranged
from enthusiasm to
apprehension.

“We do this not for the skill but
for the conﬁdence," said Fields,
who added that the cliff was
between 50 and 60 feet in height.

In a another military
mountaineering seminar, cadets
were shown how a simple rope
system known as a suspension
traverse can be used to safely
move personnel and supplies to
lower elevations.

The assault course was
designed to instruct cadets in
individual movement techniques,
according to cadet Dan Farah,
who coordinated the events.

In this, activity, cadets were
expected to negotiate a variety of
obstacles, including a rope slide
and a Tyrolian rope traverse. The
cadets scampered up and down a
hillside toward their objective
under both a barrage of enemy
machine-gun fire and an
assortment of rasping criticisms
from CM cadet Ross Scheinbaum.

.“You’d have your head blown

off by now! Do it again!”
Scheinbaum yelled.

The assault-course training
session concluded as a cadet
lobbed a dummy grenade into
the makeshift bunker, resulting
in the “destruction” of the enemy
machine-gun emplacement.

“They’re definitely breaking’ a
sweat by the time they finish,"
Scheinbaum said.

Camouﬂage training introduced
cadets to the fundamentals of
becoming invisible in a forest
setting. Three fully disguised
cadets ‘emerged from the
surrounding woods at the
conclusion of the seminar as a
testament to the effectiveness of
the camouﬂage tactics.

In the frre—starting seminar,

cadets learned that when the
weather is cold, batteries can be
your best friends. Cadets were
shown that shavings from the
casing of a field radio's
magnesium battery are excellent
fire -starters. Another
demonstration showed how two
12-volt batteries held end to end
make an effective hand warmer.

Water-procurement classes
taught cadets how to acquire and
purify water through the use of
cellophane greenhouses and
iodine tablets.

In the navigation and direction-
ﬁnding course, cadets ‘learned

Student runs for political office

By Dan Darragh
For The Pitt News

Philip White is just one of many
chemical engineering students at
Pitt, but he does have an unusual
distinction. After all, not every
Pitt student runs for political office.

The 21-year-old junior from
Elizabeth, PA, is running for a
seat on Union Township’s
supervisory board in Washington
County. As an engineering major,
White said he has problem-
solving capabilities that can
benefit his community.

White decided to enter the race
when the candidate he was
working for dropped out.

“Our board has suffered
shortsightedness,” he said. “Poor

0 planning in the past has caused

many problems for today.

“Ten years ago, the township
went with two sewage authorities
instead of building our own plant,
which would have cost a lot of
money. Now those authorities
have to build a new plant to
handle the increased volume; ,it’s
costing us more money in the
long run.

“We also have several bad roads
and bridges,” White added. “The
current board says we don’t have
enough money for roadwork, but
they’re not setting money aside
either.”

White would like to propose a
budget that allots money for future
use, so that roads can be fixed
without raising local taxes.

Union Township has five
supervisors. This year two
incumbents are up for re—election.
Running against them are four
democrats and White, whose
Republican platform is tested in
an area where Democrats out-
number Republicans four to one.

“I’ll be the first serious
Republican candidate this area's
had in years,” White said. “Due to
general apathy, not too many
Republicans campaign against the
Democrats, but, in a local election,
there’s not much difference
between the two parties. I feel I
can help the township, no matter
my political background.”

This is White’s first campaign
but not his first political
experience. That came when he
did volunteer work for George
Bush’s primary race. Afterwards,
while a first—year student at
Carnegie Mellon, he worked for
Elsie Hillman, the Republican

Party’s National Committee ‘A

Person for Allegheny County,
helping supervise a storefront
operation that supplied political

- information to the public-

White eventually transferred to

Pitt and did less political work‘

until this spring’s campaign. White
has a three—week period in
October when he’s allowed to
hang up campaign posters. These
he will make himself at his own
cost. White also wants to hold a
public forum where he and his
opponents can explain their
platforms.

There’s a great difference
between local and national
campaigns, White said. “The
president seems far removed from
everyday life. But there’s a major
impact when you say to your

neighbors, ‘Hi, I’m one of you,

and I know what needs done.’ 
Local politics puts you in the ‘

middle. Friends and neighbors
come to you with their problems;
then you go to the state for money
that’ll solve those problems,”
White said. '

White feels he has a good’
chance of winning. “People aren't 0

pleased with how their tax dollars
are being spent. They want
change.”

He adds that his young age
shouldn’t matter. “True, I don’t
know everything. But I've had
training and experience. If I
believe I can do a good job, then
I can show that confidence to the
voters,” White said

Chemical engineering and
politics may seem strange
bedfellows, but White said, “I
enjoy science. If I’m not elected
to office, I’d rather be an engineer
than a lawyer.” Being both a
political candidate and full-time
student keeps him busy. In the
future, White said he wants to
work for the state office.

Dan Buczynski/T he Pitt News‘
Philip White thinks he has a good chance of winning the election.

was turned] and hit him in the
head,” said Munera, who alleged
that Smith swung the knife at his
throat.

According to Guazzo, Smith
then sprinted across the street
into the Gulf station and told a
campus security guard, Melvin
Womack, that he was being
chased by some men. ~

According to Hong, in the store,
Smith was whispering to another
man. He then dropped the knife,
which the other man picked up

and hid in the lunchcake section. -

The knife was discovered after
police searched the store.

The four men chasing Smith
then explained their story to the
guard, who searched and
detained Smith and the other
man until city police arrived on
the scene a few minutes later.

The other man was searched.

.Then the police let him go,
' according to Hong,

“This is not the first time we’ve
seen this happen,” said witness
Steve Fink, referring to assaults in
North Oakland.

Rally ——

Continued from page 1
makes a huge difference for you
to become a part of our team.

“Remember: Football is
supposed to be fun,” Hackett
said. “When I looked up in the
stands at Temple when we were
ahead by 21 points, there were
people dancing. There were
people screaming and yelling and
having a good time. That's what
football is all about.” i

Senior fullback Ronald Redmon
thanked people for showing up
and asked that the students
continue to “support us, stay with
us and keep us in your prayers.”

Following Redmon,
quarterback Alex Van Pelt was
introduced and also thanked the
students for their support and
said he hopes that it continues.
He said the students should come
to the games and have fun
because, “it makes us play better
when you guys are having fun.”

He said, “Itmakes me happy to
see the student section filled and
having fun. For all I care the the
rest of the stadium could be
empty. This is what matters. This
is your university, and this is your
football team.”

Pitt President J.’ Dennis
O’Connor was on hand. .“A rally
like this and college football on a
Saturday afternoon is part of the
University of Pittsburgh, and Pitt
is it,” he said.

Hackett and Van Pelt both said
the turnout was “great,” and both
would like to see rallies before
every home game. Hackett said,
“I think this is part of college
football. This is what makes
college football different from
‘any other kind of football.”

Van Pelt added, “I used to look
through old books of Pitt football
and see pictures of rallies where
there would be people from the
Cathedral steps all the way over
to the union. It’s just college
football, andl don’t think there is
much more you can say. It’s a
great spirit and a great tradition,
and I think we should bringit
back.”

Brutus

Continued from page 2
[or the Federal Government],”
Brutus said.

Brutus pointed out the racism
he has seen at Pitt. “-Ijhis campus
is in a bad way. I encounter a lot
of racism on this campus,” Brutus
said. .

“I see it in the graffiti in the
[William Pitt] Union toilets
downstairs.

“The population of blacks in
this country is given at about 12
percent. I don’t believe that. I
think it’s nearly 20 percent, but
the black faculty on this campus
is about 3 percent,” Brutus said.

Brutus also spoke in support

of Affirmative Action.

“Black Americans today are
the product of disadvantaged
parents, (grandparents and
great-grandparents. So of course
you must help them,” Brutus
said.

Brutus is on sabbatical after a
five-year tenure as Black Studies
Chairman, and he just returned
from a visit to South Africa,
where he witnessed the changes
there.

On the topic of his own
country Brutus said that despite
publicized changes by the
DeKlerk government, apartheid
still exists.

While the federal government
no longer places restrictions on
where blacks can live, “every
city council can decide where
people can stay,” Brutus said.

The South African government
is writing a new constitution.
According to Brutus, however,
the voting system in the
legislative branch will provide a

block to anti—apartheid
legislation.
“In the house of

representatives, everybody will
have a vote,~and it will be a
democratic system. In the Senate
they will vote by regional
groupings. And of course, the

whites will have a regional
group,” Brutus said.

“Each group will have the
power to veto legislation. You
might pass great democratic
legislation in the Common

House, but any group in the.

upper house [Senate] can cancel
legislation in the lower house

[House of Representativesl,”

Brutus said.

“The apartheid government is °
guilty of a kind of fraud to‘

persuade the world outside that
it is changing. And President

Bush has announced that he is _ " A

lifting the sanctions against South
Africa,” Brutus said.

I wonder how many first-year
students understand the difference
between Greek life eight years

 ago and that of today?

 ‘ Fraternities and sororities, sup-
posedly the most powerful and
rebellious groups on campus, are
so constricted in rights and privi-
leges that Greek life today seems
as though Roman law is imposed
on it. Ironic?

What's wrong with this “univer-
sity?” Well, now that you men-
tioned it, let me fetch my soapbox.

A ~ For starters, our libraries need
~ more books. We wish we weren't
dependent on our teacher's cop-
ies at the reserve desk, but there’s

in “not enough money.” O’Connor
and his buddies/TR[)STees are

Robinson ,

living an opulant lifestyle, and
those with the least money bear
the burden as our tuition in-
creases every year because there’s
“not enough money.” Our pro-
fessors are paid below the na-
tional median salaries, even

though in 1986 they were prom-_

ised median salaries by 1991. Now
there’s “not enough money.” (We
are lucky there’s no teachers’

union at Pitt.) In our classes we.

witness the servitude of graduate
students, some of whom don’t
speak English, and our grades
suffer as a result, but if we ask for
a professor, we hear that there’s

“not, enough money.” Half of our I

cafeterias’ food lines shut down
midway through meals, on week-
ends and during finals. Though
we’d appreciate the efﬁciencyof
full service, there’s “not enough
money.” Ourweight room at Trees
Hall was expanded, and now that
there’s more space, it would be

 

nice to have some equipment,
but there’s “not enough money."
Getting tired of hearing that? If
you’re saying, “Yes, and can’t you
just be happy with what you
have?" then you'd better ask
President J. Dennis O’Connor the
same question.
I think you’ll find that, in the
words of Strother Martin, “What
we've got here is‘ a failure to

‘communicate. Some men you just

can’t reach  “ We ought to talk
a lot about it because we’re being
affected very personally by people
who don’t even know us. In this
case, contrary to Martin, we can
getat these people if only we
avoid student “civil war" and come
together in a focused manner.

In all the fuss about “the
emporer’s new clothes," nobody
has mentioned anything about
academic standards. While presi-
dents of companies are in business
to make a profit, university offi-
cials are not. They are in the “truth
business.”

We are told that Pitt’s philoso-
phy department ranks second in
the country. If Socrates was vis-
iting, he’d wonder how the stu-

itt occurrence

dents/scholars could project such
a contradictory image. Why do
we continue to allow these big
wigs, entrusted by us‘ to make Pitt
more like a university, to turn Pitt
into a big trade school? This past
summer O’Connor said he fa-
vored the Right to Know bill. That
was before he sat on .the throne
and saw how funds are allocated.
I wonder who/what changed his
mind?

We (students/scholars?) are in a
unique position in that Pitt can’t
fire us. We won't lose our jobs if
we complain or write our favor-
ably inclined Congressperson
[elections are coming up]. You

. don’t have to be passive.

_ Get involved by calling Telefact
for phone numbers and addresses
of officials. Benjamin Disraeli once
said, “Man is not a creature of
circumstances. Circumstancesare
the creatures of men.” ,

This essay has not been a plug
for the Right to Know bill, but I
am advocating the right to think
and to rethink for yourself.

aren’t any devoted to the support
of strident apathy.

Granted, it's not all that popular
to be apathetic around here (It's
not PC or BS or something like
that), but all of those people who

never paint their faces blue and

gold for football games or rise up

' ‘ in indignant protest whenever the

president of the university does
something frivolous are seriously
underrepresented Still, chances are
the apathets on campus would
probably take a lot less ﬂak if they
organized.

Just look at the College Repub-
licans: Republicans are generally
silly by nature, but now that they’re
organized, they are both silly and
organized.

I brought this up because the I
. other day I got this letter from Stu

Kopickni, the president of the fic-
titious Students Concerned with
Apathy and Bumming Around
(SCAB).

He wanted me to do a little
profile on his group because they
can’t get any funding for this year,
so they need free publicity. It seems
the SGB will only give money to
groups that are bent on overthrow-
ing something.

rgtmization is a Pitt necessity

So in the interest of fair journal-
ism (and giving this [burn a free ride
— just for kicks), here is the letter
Mr. Kopickni wrote me in its en-
tirety: .

“Dear Mr. Rikter:

“For about a year here at the
University of Pittsburgh there has
been a group that keeps getting
ignored by the university commu-
nity.

Unlike most groups here, our
organization doesn’t engage in
protests against the war, against
minorities or even against eating
vegetables. We don’t write letters
of outrage to the newspapers or
even go to Pitt games. Come to
think of it, Mr. Rikter, we don’t do
much of anything at all.

“That’s why I’m writing, though.
You see, not doing anything is part
of the goal of Students Concerned

Fantasy politics. Whether you consider that
an oxymoron or the ultimate truth is irrelevant.
In the spirit of fantasy football, where a group
of. owners draft a team of players and gain
points based on their performance, I want to
introduce fantasy politics.

In this game the players are from all over the
world and its performance affects international
stability. Politics is ripe with betting possibili-
ties, so let the games begin. I

In the coming year, presidential politics will
come to the forefront. Even though the
Democratic candidate will be viewed as a
sacriﬁcial lamb to take his lumps against
President Bush, the Democraats will still will
still hold the race and spend all of the taxpayers’
money. , ' _

This ritual will do more for the race in 1996
than 1992, as a variety of Democrats will seek
national exposure. However there will be 10
points for picking the victorious Democratic
candidate. Five points will be given for picking
the Democrat everyone wishes was in the race.
Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York and Sen. Bill
Bradley of Newjersey are’ possible picks in this
category. ‘

On the Republican side, no points will be
given for the presidential candidate, who will
be very Presidential. The uncertainty here will
concern the vice president.’ Dan Quayle will
probably remain on the ticket, but there will be
a lot of talk about who George Bush’s running
mate should be. Speculation should run from

Ed Kichline

Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas to Adm. Colin Powell
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to even retired Desert
Storm Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf. Seven points
for picking the Republican mentioned most
often. Fifteen points if your selection actually
ousts Quayle.

The coup in the Soviet Union has created a
muddled political picture. When Mikhail
Gorbachev was held captive, Boris Yeltsin
stood atop tanks to rally the people. Upon his,
return, Gorbachev tried to assume the leader-
ship role in,the sweeping changes. But Yeltsin
is a man of the people, and they like his
charisma.  . _ -

These two men will seek to negotiate them-
selves into power. Ten points for picking THE
man who will hold the most real power.

Remaining overseas, there will also be com-
petition among the leaders of Europe. As
Europe becomes a common market and the
Soviet Union's demise creates a power void,
Germany's Helrnut Kohl, John Major of Great
Britain and others will struggle to rise in
international prominence. Twelve points for
accurately selecting Europe’s most powerful
leader, seven forthe second most and three for
third. Europe is and will continue to become a
crucial region in the international structure.

Back home, this will be a big year for the

Supreme Court, as an abortion case will prob-
ably find its way to the highest court in the land.
If you think such a case will get that far andxit

Build bountiful bucksby betting on bigwigs   i

does, you get three points. If you think the Court T
will not consider abortion, you get seven points i

if you are right.

In the event abortion does go to the Court,
you should pick the justices who will write the
majority and dissenting opinions. Twelve points

for each correct pick and a seven-point bonus ,

for getting both in this special knowledge area._

who will show the most leadership qualities.
(This may be a trick category.)

Pitt defense comes up big - again

By Ryan Buncher
stag Writer

The Pitt football team is 5-0
because the defense continues
to do what the offense cannot—
come up with the most important
plays.

The difference was most
apparent in Saturday’s game
against Maryland. The offense

moved the ball well but

continued to blow, scoring
chances. It scored 24 points, but
it could have gotten a lot more.
They took the opening drive to
the Maryland four but had a
field goal blocked. They turned
the ball over on downs in the
third quarter. They got the ball
to the Maryland two in the fourth
quarter but had to settle for
another ﬁeld goal.

“These offensive things take

time,” said head coach Paul
Hackett. “I've said it all year
long: By the end of the year, I
think we are going to be a
pretty good offensive football
team. Right now I think our
defense is playing very well.”
The defense did have its

’ problems. The 20 points it gave

up was the most it has allowed
this season. Maryland gained

fense in 24-20 victory

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

After four games, the Pitt offense needed resuscitation. While
they were undefeated at 4-0, the offense was slow and sluggish
and needed a spark in order to get it going.

That spark appeared Saturday against the Maryland Terrapins in
the forms of Curtis Martin, Dietrich Jells and Vince Williams, and
carried the Panthers to a 24-20 win and the best starting record for

l a Pitt team‘ since 1982.

The unique thing about all three of these players is that they are
all true first-year players. _Much has been written about highly
recruited linebacker Torn Tumulty stepping in and playing this
year, but these three had fallen by the wayside. Until Saturday, that
IS. .
Curtis Martin, from nearby Allderdice High School, had played
only one year of high-school football. While he was recruited by
other big—name schools, he decided to stay at home and play at
Pitt. He was expected to have some impact this season, but few
dreamed he would contribute as much as he has. _

Martin played in the fourth quarter of the first game against West
Virginia, gaining 32 yards on four carries. Martin then played
sparingly in the next two games against Temple and Southern
Mississippi, splitting time with redshirt sophomore Jermaine
Williams. - A - .

Martin finally got the start against Minnesota and responded in
a big way. He rushed for a Big East conference-high 170 yards and
one touchdown on 18 carries. In doing so, he became only the fifth

' first-year Panther to rush for over 100 yards in a game.

Against Maryland, however, the Panthers added Martin to a
different aspect of their offensive scheme —— the passing game.

He caught six passes for 66 yards against the Terrapins. Martin
would have led the team in both total receptions and total
receiving yards if a fourth-quarter catch for a gain of 10 yards had
not been negated due to a holding call.

Martin's increased offensive role has not occurred by accident.
It is the direct result of the Pitt coaching staff tapping his potential.

“The more he can handle, the more we’ll give him,” said head
coach Paul Hackett. “If he continues to improve like he has, he’ll
become an even bigger part of the offense. Right now we’re just
afraid that he's getting tired, and we don't want to over work him.”

Martin’s play, however, was not ﬂawless. He fumbled the ball
twice Saturday, turning it over once and leading to a loss the other.

“I’ve said it over and over again: You can’t play offensive football
and fumble the ball,” Hackett said.

Martin did notsuffer as harsh a penalty as did Williams earlier
in the season, when he was benched for the rest of the Southern
Mississippi game" after a fumble. After sitting out one drive, Martin
returned the next time. _

“You have to expect to sit after youmake a mistake like that,” I

Soccer ties Big

By Jason Billings
Sta_[f Wﬁwr

The Pitt soccer team, plagued by
numerous slow starts, pulled off a 1-1 tie
in double overtime with the Boston College
Eagles yesterday. It was the Panthers’
second straight tie and third in nine games.

The Panthers’ overall record now stands

.at 4-2-3, with a Big East record of 0-2-3.

In the past few games, Pitt’s beginning-
of-the-game play has improved from
sluggish to slow-moving, but it has not
been creating offense from the very start.

Boston College began the game playing
Pitt aggressively. The defending Big East
champions forced the Panther defense
back into its own territory for almost the
entire game, completed great passes and
just basically waltzed around the Panthers
as if they were trees.

“They outplayed us," said Panther head
coach Joe Luxbacher. “The team made a
good effort. But [this game] was no slouch.”

Despite the efficient organization of the
BC ‘defense and superb passing ability of
its offense, Pitt managed to score first.

With 6:50 left to play in the first half, Pitt
first-year player Bob Dyer served up a
kick that set up the Panthers’ only goal.
Forward junior Don Overmier headed
Dyers’ kick past BC goaltender Brian
Boussey.

Other than that goal, the Pitt offense did
not rise up and challenge the BC defense
until the start of the second half.

Eagle forward Emma Okonkwo and
midfielder Justin Ceccarelli led continued
attacks against the Panther defense, but
the halftime break had given the Panthers
some much—needed vigor.

The first five minutes were not at all
indicative of the way the Panthers played
in the first half. They stormed down the
field, held off the BC defense and kept the
ball ﬂying.

. Boston College answered Pitt’s renewed
efforts, outmaneuvering Pitt for another

15 minutes.

If it weren't for the valiant efforts of
senior goaltenderTim Sobelman, the Eagles
conceivably could have beaten the
Panthers. Sobelman’s saves broke the
pressure of the relentless Eagles’ offense
and gave the Panthers a fighting chance.
Sobelman has been one of the mainstays
for a team which relies on youth for
scoring.

“lThe team] has mental lapses every
once in a while,” Sobelman said. He only
had one.

The Eagles scored on a direct kick chip
shot that sailed over the heads of the
Panther defense and goaltender. The shot
was set up on a tripping foul marked just
outside of the penalty box.

“I knew (the ball) was coming,” said
Sobelman. “I got a finger on it, butl should
have punched it out. I blame the game on
myself,” he said. ,

The Panthers’ tactics continued in the
two following overtime periods. Luxbacher

East champ BC in double overtime  

said that the ball had to be kept wide, a
problem that has bothered the team.since

‘G.-~

the beginning of the season. By using the 

ﬂanks of the offense rather than the middle,
itspreads out the opposing team’s defense.

“We were giving up the ball too easily,”
said Heinz Pak, assistant coach for the
Panthers.

“The guys came into this game excited,”
he said. “When you get excited, you make
more mistakes.”

In the second overtime period, the Pitt
defense controlled the ﬂow of the ball and
disrupted the BC offense, causing the
Eagles to give up the ball on a few
occasions.

The offense challenged BC for the ball,
much more than in the first two halves of
the game. Pitt came close to scoring with
a few minutes left in regulation play, but
the newfound energy was a little late in
the coming.

, The Panthers will meet Slippery Rock

University at Pitt Stadium on Wednesday.

Practice makes perfect, as the
saying goes. In turn, Pitt volleyball
practice led to Pitt volleyball
perfection this past weekend, as
the Panthers soundly defeated
Seton Hall and Hofstra University.

“The last two weeks of practice
have been very good for us,” said
Pitt head coach Sue Woodstra.
“Our hard work is paying off.”

The hard.-working Panthers put
down Big East rival Seton Hall
15-4, 16-14 and 15-2 on Friday

and came back on Saturday to

beat Hofstra 15-5, 15-8, 15-6.
With senior co-captain Sue
Zonneville back from her bout
with mono and the outstanding
play of senior Heather Hollands,
the pieces fell together for the Pitt
volleyball team, as it improved its

\

0 weekend road v

record to 9-5.

Against Seton Hall Pitt was led *0

by a powerful performance from
senior Linda Zols. She had 16
kills and a stellar .413 kill
percentage. Sophomore outside
hitter Ann Marie Lucanie had
eight kills, while seniorco—captain
Dee MacAulay contributed seven
kills.

Leading the Panthers
defensively was Hollands, an
experienced team player who
plays hard game after game.
“Heather really stood out this
weekend,”. Woodstra said. “She
played exceptionally well against
Seton Hall.”

The Panthers made short work
of Seton Hall with an amazing
team-kill percentage of .311. Pitt
also had seven service aces to go
along with its consistent offensive
attack.

 

The Bucettes played well in
game two but lost. Following that
loss Seton Hall crumbled and
was demolished in the third and
final game 15-2. 0

The Bucettes were led “by ; 

Caroline Kaufmann and Laura

Romeiko. Kaufmann was steady ‘ 

with 8 kills and 6 digs, while
Romeiko was a defensive whiz
with 16 digs. 0

The match, which only lasted
an hour, was Pitt’s first Big East

confrontation of the year. Thus

winning, the defending Big East
Champs picked up where they

left off lastyear, when they went . 

10-0 in league play. .
Travelling to Long Island, N.Y.,

the Panthers then took on Hofstra. .

With plenty of confidence, Pitt
shot down the Flying
Dutchwomen and won 3-0.

‘Kaplan rebounds om

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News

Scott Kaplan hit one of two ﬁeld goal attempts against Maryland.

rm: prrr NEWS, ‘Monday, oadberli, i9§1

Minnesota disaster to aid Pitt Win

By Derek Willis

Asst. Sports Editor

Five and a half minutes into
Saturday’s Pitt-Maryland game,
Panther place-kicker Scott Kaplan
trotted onto the ﬁeld to attempt a
21-yard ﬁeld goal. After last week’s
0-4 kicking performance, some
probably wondered what Kaplan
was doing on the ﬁeld to begin
with. The snap was good; the
hold ﬁne and Kaplan connected
with the ball.

It was blocked.

“Not again” must have been
the phrase running through fans’
minds, although a few other
phrases probably came to mind.

“After the first one, I said, ‘I
can’t go through this another
week,”’ Kaplan said. He probably
wasn’t the only one. In last week’s
kicking debacle, Kaplan just kept
getting worse on each attempt
until Pitt head coach Paul Hackett
removed him.

“Last week the fourth one
wasn’t even close,” Hackett said,
“and that’s when I decided to

take him out. The second one he
hit really well, but after the last

"one, we had to bring in somebody
else.”

Don Silvestri, the Panthers’
kickoff and long-field goal
specialist, kicked the ﬁnal extra
point against Minnesota.

But there would be no repeat
performances Saturday. After the
initial block, Kaplan came back
to boot three extra points and a
19-yard field goal, which helped
provide a 10-point margin for
Pitt, enabling the Panthers to hold
on for the win, 24-20. For Kaplan,
there were no thoughts about
another game like last week.

“Sometimes things are out of
your control,” Kaplan said. “Hey,
blocks happen. It was an
outstanding play by [Maryland
defensive tackle Larry Webster],

and you can’t do anything but

give him credit.”

The fourth—quarter ﬁeld goal
was also almost out of Kaplan’s
control. Pitt was deciding whether
or not to kick the ﬁeld goal or try
for the touchdown and finally

elected to kick it. But there was
confusion on the field, resulting
in both Kaplan and quarterback
Alex Van Pelt being on the ﬁeld
at the same time. Instead of calling
a time out, the Panthers tried to
take a five-yard, delay—of-game
penalty in order to give
themselves a better angle on the
kick. “Maryland did a smart thing
by not letting us take the penalty
and making it a harder kick,”
Kaplan said. -
Saturday was about all Kaplan
could handle as a football player.
“Right now I’m mentally drained,”

he said. “I played five plays this

game, so I couldn’t be physically
tired, but emotionally this was
just such an exciting game.”

This has been an unusual year V

for the junior from Coral Springs,
Fla. Coming into the 1991 season,
Kaplan ‘had never missed an extra-
point attempt or had one blocked.
He had also made 68 percent of
his field goals.

Kaplan started the season ‘

strongly by nailing a 47-yard ﬁeld
goal against West Virginia. But in
the next game, against Southern
Mississippi, his streak of 49 straight
extra points was halted, leaving
him just 11 short of the school
record.

Kaplan rebounded from that
and has converted 12 of 14 points
after touchdowns. With his six
points Saturday, Kaplan passed
Jeff Van Home on Pitt’s all—time
scoring listwith 133, tying Warren
Heller for 13th place. Ironically,
Van Horne lost his job as kicker
to Kaplan in 1988.

Even though Kaplan has not
been successful in five out of his
last six ﬁeld goal attempts, he is
still looking ahead. “I have
amnesia in terms of last week,”
Kaplan said. “I think the most
important thing for me was to
come back and play in front of
our fans, where they can gain

N conﬁdence in me again.”

Martin said. “But you can’t dwell on it either. The coaches tell
you not to think about it but not to do it again.”

_Another player who has made a greater-than—expected
impact on this year’s squad is wide receiver Dietrich Jells.

Coming out of Erie’s Tech Memorial High School, most
people knew that Jells had great speed, but his receiving skills
were suspect. The first pass that was thrown to him against
Temple he dropped in the open ﬁeld. He made up for it later
with a 46-yard reception for a score.

In the Minnesota game, he ran too far under a pass and let
it bounce off his helmet. He caught the ﬁrst pass thrown to him
against Maryland for a 58-yard score. He narrowly missed a
diving catch on an out pattern later in the game and had another
pass, thrown into double coverage, batted away.

The Panthers also tried to use Jells’ speed in the backﬁeld
Saturday. Jells tried to run a reverse in the third quarter;
however the play did not fool Terps’ safety Ron’Reagan, and he
dropped Jells for a nine-yard loss.

The third ﬁrst—year contributor for the Panthers was Vince
Williams. After coming from E.C. Glass High School in Lynchburg,
Va., Williams had not seen a down of collegiate action all
season.

On his first run in a Panther uniform, he scored the touchdown
that put Pitt ahead for good, 21-14.

Williams was an addition to the Panthers’ goal—line offense,
which showed serious faults during the Minnesota game. The
Panthers got the ball inside the 20 seven times against the
Gophers, only to be denied on every try.

Adding Williams was only one change made. The Panthers
brought in Reuben Brown, a redshirt first-year player also from
E.C. Glass, to play offensive line. Brown was switched from
offense to defense this season after the depth on the line was
considered very shaky.

Although Williams, Jells and Martin have not become the
entire team, they have made significant contributions. They also
have not solved all of the problems that the Panthers have had.
The offense drove the length of the ﬁeld on the first drive of the
Maryland game, only to come up empty after a blocked field
goal attempt.

“I’ve said all along that this team will come along slowly,”
Hackett said. “ We are very young offensively, and we need
time to develop. I think the more we play, the better we will be.”

Lucanie and Zols paced Pitt’s
attack with a barrage of
thundering spikes. Lucanie had
20 kills, while Zols contributed
10 kills to the winning cause.

Again Hollands led the team
defensively with many
spectacular plays. Head coach
Woodstra praised Hollands’

performance. “She dug many‘

spikes that you usually don’t dig,”
Woodstra said.

. I-Iofstra had problems from the
very beginning of the match. Its
kill percentage was a horrendous
.105, and many errors forced them
back on their heels.

The Flying Dutchwomen then
promptly crashed and burned,
losing three straight games.

Winning this past weekend
helped Pitt regain confidence in
their abilities on the court.

Woodstra was pleased with the
play of Zonneville and first-year
setter Anne Marie Mernagh. Both
are keys to Pitt’s volleyball
success.

Woodstra was also happy to
see the Panthers’ hard practices
start to produce results. “Our
attitudes are going in the right
direction; the matches this
weekend have showed our
progress,” Woodstra said.

“Everybody played well,"
Woodstra said. The girls were
moving around well on the cou rt. ”

The team has come together at
the right time, as Big East play
has started for the Panthers.

Woodstra has prepared another
team to win the Big East title.
Woodstra is undefeated in Big
East play since being named head
coach in 1989, and she knows
this team can win the title again.

To win the Big East title again,
the Panthers will have to be
perfect. They will have to serve
perfectly, spike perfectly, dig
perfectly and most

importantly practice perfectly.

own 39. They had a fourth-and-
three at their own 48 after Pitt
cornerback Steve Israel dropped
an interception on third down.
Sandwisch hit Gene Thomas for
seven yards and a first down at
the Pitt 45. Three completions
later, they had the ball at the 20.

Pitt’s defense faced a moment
where it would hold on to the
game or lose it. The fans seemed
as much into the game as they
were all day.

“I was pumped. I was keeping
‘em up, waving to the fans,” said
defensive lineman Jeff Esters. “If
he’d have stayed in the pocket, I
think I could have made the sack,
but he rolled out, and it was up to
Rico (McDonald) and Keith
(Hamilton) to keep him
contained.”

A first-down pass
incomplete. On second down,

first-year linebacker T om T umulty I

broke up a screen pass with a
solid hit on running back Troy
Jackson. Free safety Lex Perkins
stopped the third-down play by
hammering receiver Richie Harris.
The Terps’ chances were then
swallowed up in Wha1ey’s hands
with only 23 ticks remaining on
the clock, as the strong safety
stepped in front of Harris.

“It’s incredible,” Whaley said
of the effects of big hits by his
teammates. “You just get so hyped
up. You just go and play 110
percent on the next play so maybe
you can do something like that. It
‘just uplifts the defensive spirit
tremendously.”

The defense also came up big
in a similar situation in the
previous game againstMinnesota,
when the Golden Gophers had
one last possession, down 14-13,
and Pitt’s defense stuffed them.

“I think it’s something that the
defense didn't do last year,” Esters
said of coming up big at big
moments. “That motivates us
more to do it this year. Basically
it’s thesame defense as last year.”

Another big moment in the
game against Maryland was after
Badgett’s touchdown in the fourth
quarter. With the score 24-20,
Maryland Coach Joe Krivak

_elected to go for a two-point

conversion. A pass for H—back
Frank Wycheck fell incomplete.

“I think_ we pretty much had a
feeling what they might try to
do,” Hackett said. “N/ycheckl
came in motion, made a little
move and made a move to the
outside. I think the thing about
the two-point play was, if you
look at it, the pressure that we
had. The pressure had him
[Sandwisch] disoriented as he
rolled to the left.”

Hackett stressed contributions
from young and old players.
Whaley had eight tackles and

forced a fumble as well as having

the interception and a sack.
Tumulty had five tackles and some
big hits. Sophomore linebacker

Charles Williams had_ nine tackles. 1
They also got big plays from.

“I strongly believe it’s not right
to kill babies,” Brown said.
Linda Behrhorst of Shaler
agreed. “We have to instill in
people’s minds that all life is
sacred,” Behrhorst said.
Several teen-age activists
voiced their support for
alternatives to pregnancy.
Women who get pregnant have
to live with the consequences,
according to Nikki Waterson of

Butler.

“It’s like letting them be born
and just shooting them. If
[pregnant women] let themselves
get into that situation, they should
have to live it out,” Waterson, 15,
said.

Waterson’s sister, Beth, said
women who have abortions are
“killing little kids.”

“I wouldn’t want someone to
do that to me,” Beth, 14,
said.

the basics of getting around in
the wild without a compass.
«Methods covered in the
presentation taught cadets how
to orient themselves with help of
the stars, the sun and a watch.
The shelter seminar instructed
cadets on the construction of
improvised shelters for use in
emergency situations. Another
workshop divided emergency-
signal methods into two groups:
.those used when the enemy isn’t
around and those used when it is.
The role of the field exercises
in ROTC is to prepare cadets for
an advanced-training camp for
potential officers, according to
Marietta. The advanced camp,
which takes place in the summer
between a cadet’s junior and
senior year, not only determines
which cadets will be

objectification of the human body
is the first step towards
justifying violence against that
person.

“Through objectification,
people see other humans as less
human,” she said.

Wivell also believes that this
objectification of bodies in
advertising plays a hugerole in
gender stereotypes.

“There is a body type, one
single body type, that American

commissioned as officers but also
decides whether cadets will enter
the active armed forces or the
reserves.

ROTC also hosted about 20
students from Oliver High
School’s JROTC, a high—school
version of the college-level
program.

“JROTC is not designed to
encourage young people to join
the military. It’s basically there to
promote good citizenship,” said
Lt. Col. Michael Cassetori, who is
a professor of military science
and the commanding officer of
Pitt’s ROTC.

While the weekend training
exercise focused on necessary
military skills, the scenery alone
was enough to satisfy some.

“I just love being out here in
the mountains. You can’t beat it,”
Scheinbaum said.

women are supposed to aspire
to,” she said. “Because it promotes
such rigid gender roles it exploits
both men and women.”

“It presents a myth for how
people are supposed to live. It
tells you that by buying things,
you can_ be a happy person,” she
added.

devoted to dismantling men’s
violence.
