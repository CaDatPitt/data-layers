M importance ofncknowleiiging the many
dimensions ofsexniziity

In the hit HBO series “Girls,” Lena Dun-

.ham’s appealing and endearing character,

Hannah, is often shown as wanting to talk
or reﬂect during sex. Most of the characters
have moments in the show involving sex
during which you want to laugh out loud,
cringe and sometimes look away from the
television because it’s just too awkward. But
these instances are often very real presen—
tations of sex, a point that television critics
often laud.

You’ll ﬁnd that today’s issue of The Pitt
News. can elicit some of those same reac-
tions. You’ll read about people’s sexual ex-
periences with their partners. Maybe you’ll
laugh about a man’s attraction .to his girl-

lfriend’s “kissy lips,” or perhaps you’ll cringe

at the thought of someone using a ball gag
in the bedroom. But for people, that’s their
“sex,” and it’s important to acknowledge
that not everyone does it the same way.
This is the ﬁfth—annual Pitt News Sex
Edition, ‘with this year aiming to provide
commentary on a variety of topics that may
or may not be a part of your own romantic
or sex life. Birth control, pheromones and
asexuality are just a few of the concepts cov-
ered. Sex can be a generational issue, but it’s
also one that has to do with the nature and

desires of sex itself.

So why do we publish this issue?

With many of our special editions, The
Pitt News wants to provide a service to its
readers, to supply them with information
and foster a dialogue. Men and women can
read “Fifty Shades of Grey,” but the novel
doesn’t provide an accurate representation
of sadomasochisrn.

_Of course, with this issue comes criti-
cism. Readers may be taken aback at the
photos of their peers in skimpy clothing. Or
perhaps stories about sadomasochism and
birth control on campus make some people
uncomfortable. It’s easy, like many contro-
versial topics, to just not talk about them.
But by talking openly, we’re addressing a
topic in order to try to respect individual
experiences, beliefs and identities.

Putting this issue of the newspaper to-
gether, we’re reminded of the many dimen-
sions of sexuality there are to explore, so let
these stories serve as a starting point for a

. candid discussion with peers.

Happy Valentine’s Day and Hail to Pitt,

Amy Friedenberger
Editor—in—Chief

SGB Board member pushes for free condoms on campus

Mahita Gaj anan
Staff Wrz'ter

Sowmya Sanapala is working to unwrap issues
concerning the birth control options offered
on campus.

As one of her initiatives as a 2013 Student
Government-Board member, Sanapala has
started an initiative to improve sexual health
on campus, speciﬁcally focusing on providing
free condoms to students at Student Health
Services, located ontheﬁfthﬂoor ofthe Medical
Arts Building on Fifth Avenue.

The details of the initiative are still being
worked out, as Sanapala continues to work
closely with Student Health Services, Campus
Women’s Organization — a student group that
represents the women of the University and
raises awareness about gender issues regarding
health, identity, race, sex and politics — and
LGBT Outreach Initiative. The LGBT Outreach
Initiative is a new organization on campus that
aims to create the vehicle for change in attitudes
regarding sexuality— and gender—related issues,
such as establishments for gender non-speciﬁc
restroom and locker—room facilities and sexual-
health awareness.

Although she initially started her project
with the idea of making condoms accessible
for free in residence halls, Sanapala has since
had to restructure her goals. To begin, Sana-
pala decided to ﬁgure out what Student Health
Services, the go—to for any student who needs a
medical consultation on matters from the com-
mon cold to sexually transmitted infections,
currently offers.

Current offerings

Through her research, Sanapala discovered
that if a student wishes, he or she can make an
appointment withaspecialist at Student Health
forabirth-control consultation, STI testing and
gynecological appointments.

Afemale studentcanobtain hormonal forms
ofbirth control, suchas the pill oranintrauter-
ine device, through the Student Health phar-
macy, and she has avariety of options regarding
the prices and choice of whether to cover the

costs with insurance. Some products, suchasthe

Plan B One—Step pill, are offered for $34, which
is $16 cheaper than the regularprice elsewhere.

FreshmanEmma Bixenstine said that al-
though she supports the distribution of free
condoms, she doesn’t believe hormonal forms
of birth control should be provided at a dis-
count. If the pill is offered at a lower rate, or
for free, students might think it would be okay
to do without condoms, Bixenstine said. She

. noted that since condoms prevent both STIs

and pregnancy, it would be more beneﬁcial to
provide them for free, and no student would
have a reason not to procure condoms.
Condoms, however, are not currently offered
for free at Student Health. They are sold at a dis-
counted price. Before putting them in residence
halls, Sanapala realized that the ﬁrst step would

-be to make condoms available without cost at

the Student Health pharmacy.

“Financiallyjspeaking, providing free con-
doms is very feasible,” Sanapala said, as the cost
could be absorbed in the $85 fee each student
pays per semester to cover services from Stu-
dent Health.

At the Rite Aid on Forbes Avenue, a 12—pack
of lubricated Trojan condoms costs about $11.
The Student Health pharmacy offers the same
kind for $4.50. Depending on the brand and
type of condom, the 12—packs sold at the Student
Health pharmacy range from $4 to $10; The
Student Health pharmacy offers both Trojan-
and LifeStyles—brand condoms. V

For freshman‘ Danny Howard, the major
question is whether providing free condoms
makes it seem like the University promotes
sex, although he thinks that free condoms will
show that the University cares about prevent-
ing diseases and pregnancy. Howard said that
going to convenience stores like Rite Aid to buy
condoms is not especially inconvenient, but that
it’s more about students not wanting to spend
the money. If condoms are free, students will
use them more, he said.

Further, "Howard would like to see condoms
available in residence halls, because they would
be more accessible.

“The sooner, the better,” Howard said. “If it’s

two in the morning, and people are too drunkto
care and go buy condoms, they’ 11 be right there.”
Supporting education ‘

However, Sanapala faced opposition almost
as soon as she made her project idea public.

“There were some conservative students
who voiced concerns about having their student
health fee go towards this,” she said.

The biggest imposition to progress, however,
seems not to be direct disagreement, but a reluc-
tance to start the conversation. Sarah Sullivan,
a student ambassador of the Pittsburgh AIDS
Task Force and an unofficial liaison between
CWO and SGB, said that because people ﬁnd
the topic of contraception controversial, there
is a tendency to talk about it less.

“[University administrators] don’ttalk about
it, which I think is unrealistic because a lot of

people use birth control for general issues, and
it doesn’t need to be tied into morality issues
around sex,” she said.

Sullivan * suggested that Student Health
publicizes its services regarding sexual health
moreso than University administrators do, but
she believes the information has to be distrib-
uted in a more efficient manner. Many students
are not aware of what Student Health does or
doesn’t offer. Sanapala herself did not know
that condoms are not currently available for
free until she looked into the issue.

“I think that the University offers a lot of very
good resources in terms of gettingbirth control
from Student Health, but it doesn’t always do a
good job ofletting people knowwhat resources
are available,” Sullivan said.

Pitt ranks fairly high when it comes to sexual

Whips, chains incite sexual adventurousness in the bedroom

BrettiM.urphy
Stqff Writer

Most got it during a long car ride. Your dad
decided to ﬁll the silence with a dreaded par-
enting milestone — “the talk.” And, chances
are, he left the chains, handcuffs, collars, ball
gags and whips out of the birds and the bees.
But behind many bedroom doors, from college
campuses to CEOs’ penthouses, “alternative”
sex rocks the headboards. A

S Sadomasochism (or S&M) has been grow-
ing in public recognition since the advent of
pop—cultural taboo-‘busters such as “Fifty
Shades of Grey” and Rihanna’s 2011 radio hit

“S&M.” S&M is deﬁned as the giving or receiv- _

ing of pleasure — often sexual —— from acts
involving the inﬂiction or reception of pain‘ or
humiliation. But casting such a broad blanket
forvery personal preferences can cause prob-
lems and confusion, as controversy has grown
alongside S8zM’s popularity.
' “There are many versions of S&M, from
mild to wild,” Pittsburgh-based sex therapist
John Beiter said. “But it’s important to dis-
tinguish between the lifestyle and playing.”
Beiter considers “living the lifestyle” the
extreme end of the S&M spectrum, in which
participants consciously take the submissive or
domineering sexual roles out of the bedroom
and into their everyday life. They display overt
signs of ownership on their persons atalltimes

— handcuffs around their necks or whips in
their back pockets. ‘

But you’re not likely to see a Pitt student
walking her boyfriend with a chain and ball
gag down Forbes Avenue. The other end of the
spectrum —_ those that restrict S&M to bed-
room play —— is much more prevalent, but still
warrants some uncertainty among scholars.

“One thing that makes S&M a diflicult topic
for students to grapple with is that it is taking
issues of dominance and power and explicitly
sexualizing them,” said political science pro-

fessor Andrew Lotz, who teaches a course '

about women in political theory in which the
treatment of women in society is a topic. “It
makes power sexy.”

But for some, it’s not the act itself that’s
enticing. Bridget Miller, who asked her name
to be changed because of S&M’s stigma in many
circles, said it’s the fantasy aspect ofthe experi-
ence that draws her to it. Millerbegan S&M in
her freshman year when she and her boyfriend
began experimenting on a whim.

“You can become a different person in the
bedroom, and the closed-door secrecy makes
it even sexier,” she said.

As Beiter phrased it, “S&M provides a play-

ground for exploration.”

The idea of playing out a fantasy, a staged
disconnect from reality, is very important in

Laws of attraction, nature draw romantic partners together

Natalie Daher
Staff I/Vriter

This Valentine’s Day, starry—eyed students will
scramble to purchase heart—shaped chocolate
boxes, prepare candlelit dinners and write the
perfectly mushy message on their signiﬁcant
others’ card. They may be overlooking a major
factor in the love game. And this factor isn’t
emotional — it’s animalistic.

When it comes to the laws of attraction,
researchers have uncovered a number of
physiological and physical cues —— primar-
ily stemming from the_ olfactory and visual
senses —— that inﬂuence the chemistry between
individuals. These unconscious attractions are
rooted in evolutionary theory, which holds that
the instincts of desire center on fertility — men
seem to seek women who are fertile, while
women seek men apt to take care of their kids.

Substantial research has been conducted
on biochemicals known as pheromones, which

have the power to influence the sexual attrac— .

tion between animals of the same species.
These fragrance—free chemicals are carried
in body odor. Whereas the existence of sex
pheromones in animals stands more as hard
science than it does in humans, many studies
have supported their presence.

Nathan Morehouse, a professor of animal
communication at Pitt, has studied the sexual
interaction between living things.

“You may have a conscious realization that

you like the way that your boyfriend stinks, but
there may be an emotional undercurrent to that
you don’t really understand,” Morehouse said.

The science of body odor

Morehouse refers to the “major stability
complex” as the undercurrent that drives the
attraction between men and women. This com-
plex is based on an intrinsic desire for a partner
with a different copy of genes to produce off-

spring with a stronger immune system that is -

more resilient against disease.

logical aspects of human sexuality at Pitt, re-
ferred to an experiment that achieved results
supporting this theory. According to Cousins,
humans want to be attracted to mates with a
different major histocompatibility complex
(MHC), a protein complex that functions in
an individual’s immunities and detection of
'self—versus-nonselfantigens.

In the experiment Cousins referred to, the
MHC component was identiﬁed in all partici-
pants’ genesthrough saliva samples. Then,
the male subjects played basketball without
deodorant, and each of their sweaty T—shirts

was sniffed by the female participants after the

game. The results showed that women were
more likely to rate a man’s odor as more at-
tractive if he had a dissimilar MHC component
to their own.

“If they’re too similar in genes, then they
border on the inbreeding lines,” Cousins said.
“In order to have healthy offspring, you don’t
want to have someone who matches com-
pletely, because you’d be more likely to have
genetic problems.”

Morehouse added that although this is not
particularly sexy, a diverse set of MHC compo-
nents determines “whether or not your partner
or kids will survive the plague.”

Facial attraction »

Another aspect of the study that Cousins de-
scribed had to do with appearance. A separate
group of women ranked the male participants
based on attractiveness in ‘terms of the sym-
metry of their faces.

“If you think of anybody who’s in the media,
like beautiful people, they tend to have sym-
metrical faces, and people like symmetrical
faces,” Cousins said.

. The study-found that women judged the

c smelly T—shirts as more appealing if the male

owner had a more symmetrical face. Accord-
ing to Cousins, this preference for symmetry
goes hand—in-hand with other physical cues
that women ﬁnd attractive such as a square

GOING MENTAL

Recognize asexuality as a Iegitimatesexual orientation :

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

My friend Sasha, aPitt junior, is one ofthe esti-
mated 1 percent of the world’s population who
identiﬁes as asexual. That doesn’t mean she
reproduces via binary ﬁssion. An asexual, as
deﬁned by the Asexual Visibility and Educa-
tion Network (AVEN), is aperson who does not
experience sexual attraction. I

In a culture that’s still coming to terms with
the many varieties of human sexual attraction
and preference, the idea that some people aren’t
sexually attracted to anyone seems, to some, like
a step too far. But many, like the asexual blogger
s.e. smith, believe that “aces” have always been
around. And increasingly, they’re not content
to be left out of the conversation.

When asked what’s the most irnportantthing
she wants people to know about asexuality, Sasha
answers bluntlyr, “that we exist.” She echoes the
sentiments of many activists who claim that
invisibility is still the biggest obstacle, and de-
scribes the relief she felt when she leamedabout
asexuality at 19, after years of reading sexuality
textbooks‘ and wondering, “Why don’t I ﬁt in?”

, On the heels of the idea that no one is really
asexual follows the idea that people who identify
that way are sick, uaumatized or crazy — the
ca1:ch—all most aces use is “broken.” It is often
assumed that asexuality stems from sexual
trauma or a repressive upbringing. However,

many asexuals have neverbeen sexually abused,
and most people who grow up in repressive,enVi—
ronments report always having had sexual feel-
ings, accompanied by intense guilt and anxiety.
Asexualsoften attestto feelingtheywere “born
this way” —— as many gay and bisexual people
do — and they are more likely to experience
guilt and anxiety over nothavingthose feelings.

That makes it diﬂicult evenfor asexuals who
are secure in that part of their lives to access
mental health care. When asexuals share their
gripes, one of the most common narratives is

of people who try to get'therapy for unrelated

issues, only to have their therapists focus alltheir
energies on “curing” the lack of sexual attraction.
Sasha is quick to caution me that beingasex-
ual is "t the same as simply not being interested
in sex. It’s more complicated than that. Some
aces are repulsed by sex, some are apathetic to
it, and some experience havinga sex drive that’s
just never directed ataparticular person. Many
will have sex to please their partners and enjoy
it, but most don’t enjoy it the wayI enjoy having
sexwith my boyfriend — they enjoy it the wayI
enjoy playing Settlers of Catanwithhim. I’d never
suggestiton my own, butI have funbecause I’rn
with my boyfriend doing something he lbves.
Like sexual people, asexuals only have posi-
tive sexual experiences in low-pressure situ-

ations where they feel respected and safe. No-
one enjoys being guilted or cajoled into sex, and ,

sexwith apartner who thinks they can “prove”

you’re -not “really” who you say you are is always
just as terrible as it sounds. Unfortunately, this

— experience is depressingly common.

Asexuals, for the most part, are treading
uncharted territory in the ﬁeld of sexuality and
relationship theory, and as such, they have to

create a lot of their own language for what they \

experience. Thewebsite Asexuality.org actu-
ally has awiki to help users keep up with all the
deﬁnitions. In fact, one of the most common
criticisms of asexuality as a movement is that it_
seems so vocab-obsessed, butas someone who
has always had language for my experiences, I
don’tthink that’s fair. Labels can constrain, but

they can also provide a sense of belonging; as l

we allow people to eschew labels, we also have
to grant them the right to embrace them.

In the tradition of Alfred Kinsey’s “scale”.

of sexual orientation, which sought to provide
nuance beyond the cut—and—dry labels of gay,
straight and bisexual, asexuals tend to locate
themselves somewhere on the “ace spectrum.”

Some people identify as “grey” asexuals, expe— .

riencing sexual attraction so rarely thatthey feel

‘ they don’t have enough data to call themselves

gay, straight or bi. Some think of themselves as
demisexual, only able to feel attraction when
a very strong emotional bond already exists.
And that bond can be romantic in nature.
Though some people idenﬁfyas aromantic, oth-
ers identify as heteromantic, homoromantic,
biromantic and everything in between. Many

people have romantic relationships that don’t
include sex — and no, that isn’t “just being
friends,” or else there would be “no difference
between havingaboyfriend and havingafriend
with beneﬁts.

Outside the romantic paradigm, some people
form what they’re calling “queerplatonic” rela-
tionships. The word indicates nothing about
the gender of the participants, but speaks to

A’ the desire to “queer” our understandings of

platonic friendships. These are relationships of
care — “life partnerships” that go quite beyond
what most of us consider ordinary friendship.
Many sexually ambiguous literary or onscreen
relationships — think Frodo and Sam, Holmes
and Watson, Thelma and Louise —‘ can also be
read as queerplatonic. I

Most importantly, as Sasha repeated
throughout our interview, those relationships

, are as valid and important "as sexual relation-

ships and deserve acknowledgmentand respect.
Although sexual intimacy is an important part
of a primary relationship for most people, it
shouldn’t follow thatarelationship without sex-
‘ual intimacy is inherently less close. Sasha most

wants to see an improvement in spreading the ~

word thatwe all have the option to chec “none
of the above.” She also wants to see improvement
in “the expansion of possibilities. There are so
many ways to have relationships, and as long
as nobody’s being hurt, all of them are OK.” I

THE STAMATTACK

Sexonomics: Why don’t people have s

i Nick Stamatakis
‘ Asszstcmt 0pz'm'o72s Editor

. Among leisure activities, sex might have one of

the best cost—beneﬁt ratios.

On the cost side, you don’t need to spend
time getting a ﬁshing license. You don’t have to
invest thousands of dollars in boat repairs. You
don’t need to spend years training with costly
riding lessons.

Aside from the comparatively small costs of
birth control, a willing companion and food to
make up for lost calories, the whole experience
won’t set you that far back in time or money.

The beneﬁts are well—documented: Lower
stress, higher immunity, improved heart health,
more self—esteem and better sleep .can all be
linked to increased sexual activity.

Plus, in terms of pleasure, sex is better than
most calzones. And it takes quite a mighty apple
pie to outperform sex on most measures of satis-
faction (but since studies show that one inthree
would give up sex for their favorite food, maybe
the pie doesn’t need to be that good).

Still, sex is the free pizza of interpersonal ac-
tivities, atheoretically endless source ofpleasure
that, if gone about in the right way, costs nothing
for anybody involved. As students, we are, from
one perspective, just a bunch of potential ves-
sels of personal, and other people’s, happiness.

And yet, when compared to other leisure
activities, we don’t actually have that much sex.

Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, -and Re—
production, over halfof single men from 18-24
have not had sex in the past year. Only 40 per-
cent of partnered women have sex more than
once aweek. "

To highlight how comparatively rare sex is,
the Kinsey statistic suggests Americans have
more servings of french fries than sexual en-
counters over their adult lives. _ '

V Lookingattimeperiods,ratherthannumber

- of encounters, reveals more truths. The average ‘

sexual encounter — from foreplay to ﬁnish —
takes about 30 minutes (_the amount of time
necessary to properly satisfy awoman, accord-
ing to sex therapist Dr. Ava Cadell). .

If the average 18-to-29-yeari— old does, in fact,
have sex two times a week, as suggested by the
Centers for Disease Control, sex isn’ttakingthat
much of our time.VAccording to the American
Time Use Survey, the average American spends
much more time doing other activities, including
playingvideo games (2.7 times as much as sex),
purchasing consumer goods (2.6 times as much
as sex) and providinglawn and garden care (1.3

times as much as sex).

‘ But none of this compares to our benevo-
lent overlord, live and time-delayed television.
Among 18-to—24-year—olds, this pastime takes
up 10 times more of our time than sex.

It would appear that as a collective society,
we seem to be saying we prefer “Downton” to
getting down aton. '

. Of course, one of the reasons people engage

in television watching more often than sex is
the natural limits of the human body. An entire
“Dexter” marathon of sex could kill a person;

. you can’t make up for lost time in the bedroom

by trying to go for it ten times in ﬁve hours.

Nonetheless, the statistics still stand, leading
to some insights:

For one, the common perception that young
people are sexually explosive ﬁreworks-rubbing
our shoes on carpets in a lightning storm is a bit
off. For many, there are still very strong social
forces that make the blazen stranger—on—strang—
er sexual encountertoo odd and uncomfortable
to ‘be realistic. We talk a big game, but if these
surveys are correct, the game is a lot smaller
thanwe’d expect. _

Another thingis that we, as a culture, may
be »underestimating the costs of sex. There are
emotional stresses that are often overlooked.
Maybe, for most of us, ﬂirtingisjusta complete
disaster. ’ C

_Another thing to re-examine is the differ-
ence between sex and the pursuit of sex. The

' data spell out how the idea of a person is often

better than the real thing: The marginal beneﬁt
of each additional sexual encounter after the ﬁrst
seems to go down fast. Really fast. For 15 percent
of single people our age, it goes down so much
so that they will only have sex a coupletimes a
year. Apparently, it just isn’t worth the fuss for
the pleasure. We’cl rather marathon “Howl Met
Your Mother.”

But on the other hand, while single "people.

ex as much as they say they do?

tend to peter out quickly, the most sexually active
demographic inthe country is married couples
between the ages of 18 and 24. You probably
don’t know too many of these people, but ac-
cording to the National Center for Education
Statistics, 18 percent of undergraduates are
married. The statistic ﬂies in the face of many
perceptions.

As an interesting aside, the time Americans
spend having sex each week is roughly the same
as the amount oftime spentinreligious or spiri-
tual activities. Make of that what you will.

Overall, we are not the self—obsessed, plea-
sure-possesed heathens we are sometimes
portrayed as. The Internet has made nearly
instantaneous sex a possibility, with websites
designed to satisfy any urge in any direction,
often with instructions on how to get to each
other’s location. This is the world we live in, and

' yet we aren’t mating like rabbits.

Basically, just remember that anything you
tl1inkabout general sexhabits is probably mostly
wrong. No other subject remains as cloudy in
the popular consciousness of America. The best
— and really only — advice is that you should
examine yourpersonal moral, physical and emo-
tional fabric to decide what you want, and then
rearrange your life to match your preferences.
Don’t rely on Google to tell you how to act.

Sex in romantic comedies no longer plays hard to get

Kathleen Fennell
Staﬁ‘ Writer

If you don’t have a signiﬁcant other to snuggle

up with this Valentine’s Day, you may ﬁnd your- .

selfcuddled with your friends Ben andjerry to
watch your favorite comedy or drama. But if
it’s romance you’re looking for, chances are you
won’t be turning on a ﬁlm that’s been made in
the past 10 to 15 years. a

Hollywood screenwriter Carl Kurlanderbe—
lieves movies are getting less romantic, and he’s
not alone. According to Kurlander, who now
serves as a senior ﬁlm studies lecturer at Pitt,

each generation has quintessential romantic

comedies that deﬁne the times. For instance,

“Clueless” (1995) and “Reality Bites” (1994)

capture the essence of the ’90s for viewers.

“When you think of the ’80s, you do think of
the “grand gesture,”’ he said. “You do think of
‘Say Anything’ with the boombox.”

In Kurlander’s opinion, capturing a certain
time and place is an aspect of screenwriting
that presents several challenges for would—be
romantic classics of the millennial generation.
Today, movie makers face challenges in provid-
ing obstacles to drive the plot of movies and in
capturing romance memorably, because show-

ing a sexual relationship is often easier.

While societal developments such as increas-
ing openness to different types of relationships
and growing acceptance of overt sexuality have
led to fewer barriers to romantic pursuits in daily
life, some ﬁlm authoriﬁes believe they might be
having the opposite effect in the theater. And far
from representing modern views on relation-
ships and gender equality, today’s romantic
movies might actually represent a step backward
in the cinematic portrayal of women.

“The best romances capture an era,” Kur-
lander said. “Fm waitingfor someone from your
generation to say, this is what our life is like.”

On the big screen

"One reason this generation hasn’t witnessed
its deﬁning movie yet may be the lack of industry
censorship in terms of sex. Ellen Bishop, a ﬁlm
studies lecturer in Pitt’s English department,
pointed out that romantic comedies today in-
clude more sex than movies in past generations.

“There’s a lot more sex now. In_ those older
movies, it’s almost all romance. They might kiss
at some point, or somebody hugs somebody,
but that’s about it  That was hot and steamy
then,” Bishop explained.

Perhaps, Bishop suggested, older movies
were more romantic simply because that’s all
they could be. According to Bishop, writers of
screwball comedies of the 1930s used double
entendres and sexual jokes to circumvent the
Motion Picture Production Code — a censor-
ship code that was strict in its prohibition of
references to sex. For instance, in the 1953 ﬁlm
“From Here to Eternity,” Deborah Kerr and Burt
Lancaster lay side by side on a beach, causing a
stir among audiences. In_“Casab1anca” (1942),
the main characters are fully clothed for the
entire movie, but the viewer is made to assume

\ thatthey are havinga sexual relationship, which

gives the movie heightened emotional value.
“It’s almost easierto make it visual if it’s peo-
ple having sex. You can ﬁlm that and it’s pretty
deﬁnite,” Bishop said. “Romance is harder to
capture, which is part of the reason why the
great romantic ﬁlms from before the motion
picture code died in the ’60s had this lasting
impact  There’s this strength in the presenta-
tion of the characters that makes it so romantic.”
Molly Brown, another ﬁlm studies lecturer,

said that one explanation for why sex is more ‘

visible in movies is that sexuality is also more
presentintoday’s society. She pointed to Presi-
dent Clinton’s scandal with Monica Lewinsky as
the catalystfor society’s acceptance of casual sex.

This trend toward a more casual treatment
of sex is evident  movies such as “No Strings
Attached” (2011) and “Friends With Beneﬁts”
(2011),-in which romance blossoms from non-
committal sexual relationships.

“Hook-up culture is becoming more main-
stream. It’s the way that younger couples oper-
ate, and there are less formal dating rituals,”
Brown said. ‘

Kurlander said that the transition from
friendship to romantic or sexual relationships
has changed drastically in movies such as “No
Strings Attached” compared to the ’8os classic
“When Harry Met Sally” (1989). A

“In ‘When Harry Met Sally’ it was: Can men
and women be friends? Your generation is more
like, ‘We’re friends all the time, but can we be
more without messing up the ﬁiendship? 
We’re friends, but should we have sex because
we’re a boy and a girl‘?”’ Kurlander said.

Bishop agreed, noting the age shift romance
has taken in movies‘ since the presentation of
casual sex among young adults has become
mainstream in cinema. - ' '

7,000 years later, birth control remains controversial

Em Maier
Staﬁwriter

As hippies, LSD and draft riots became prev-
alent, so did something else that changed
American (and global) society: the pill.

The combined oral contraceptive pill,
often known simply as “the pill,” was ﬁrst ap-
proved for use in 1960 as a means to prevent
pregnancy. A human goal since the begin-
ning of time had ﬁnally been accomplished,
but naturally the monumental development
spurred debate.

Discovery of the pill

One of the oldest references to an attempt
at birth control occurs in the book of Genesis
in the Bible, with mention of the practice
of coitus interruptus in the story of Onan,
who is condemned by God for withdrawing
before climax to avoid impregnating his late
brother’s wife. The idea of contraception
re—emerged during the Greek Classical pe-
riod, which occurred between the ﬁfth and
fourth centuries B.C., when Greek philoso-
phers such as Aristotle began experimenting

with natural chemicals to discover primitive

spermicides.

Sperm was officially discovered _in 1677
by a student of geneticist Antoni van Leeu-
wenhoek. In 1827, scientists discovered the
existence of the female egg, and the devel-
opment of contraception took off from
there. A few years later, German physician
Friedrich Wilde designed) a precursor to the
diaphragm, a cervical cap that blocks sperm
from entering the uterus, thereby prevent-
ing fertilization.

Charles Goodyear, founder of Good-
year Tires and known for the innovation of
vulcanized rubber, began manufacturing
condoms in 1855 along with other contra-
ceptive devices. Other small events such
as the development of the calendar—based

planning method, the discovery of the pitu- .

itary gland’s control over sex organs and the
identiﬁcation of the hormones progesterone
and estrogen occurred over the course of
the next century. ,

Then in 1960, after almost a decade of
clinical trials, gynecologist John Rock cre-

ated the drug Enovid, which was prescribed

for both menstrual disorders and contra-
ception. _ ‘ C
The pill works by preventing ovulation.
Rock used natural hormones, estrogen and
progestin, in order to decrease the release of
a precursor to both the follicle-stimulating
hormone and the luteinizing hormone. The
combination of these two hormones eventu-
ally causes ovulation and thickens cervical
mucus, making the sperm’s journey more
difficult. _ -
To put it simply, the pill is like a magician:
It tricks the ovary into thinking it’s already
released an egg. It doesn’t’eliminate the
presence of hormones; so menstruation still
occurs while a woman is on the pill.
Studies have demonstrated that the typi-
cal incidence rate of pregnancy while on the

pill is between 2 and 8 percent, with -failures
usually associated with individuals who take
the medication incorrectly or inconsistently.
Women who take the pill exactly as instruct-
ed — a rare occurrence — have a pregnancy
rate of 0.3 percent per year.

Pills aren’t a costly option: Prices range
from $15 to $50 depending on the type, but
it could be even lower with insurance.

Most women take a form of the pill called
“combination,” containing both estrogen
and progestin. Others may take a progestin-
only pill. Both offer a plethora of beneﬁts in
addition to birth control.

The former can aid in protection from
acne, endometrial and ovarian cancers,
cramps, irregular periods and abnormali-
ties in the breasts or ovaries. _,

" Combination pills often dictate the time
and frequency of a period: from monthly
cycles, to only a few periods a year, to nev-
er. Progestin—only pills, nicknamed “mini—
pills,” focus more on cervix mucus than
ovulation, and are less effective than the
combination varieties.

Though they are infrequent, some disad-
vantages of the pill such as nausea, breast
tenderness and bleeding between periods

may occur. However, many of the side effects
can be alleviated by controlling the timing
of the pill or switching to a different type.

Social debate

About 50 years ago, Americans could be

V arrested, tried and sentenced to prison just

fordistributing birth control. This standard
originated with the Comstock Law, passed in
the U.S. on March 2, 1873, speciﬁcally pro-
hibiting contraceptives as obscene material

and banning their dissemination. I

SURVEY

The @VOIt‘tU1ttflOItT <o>tF sex jpxerrce

1975

On Oct. 3, 1975, an article titled “Sex on

Campus —- Rumor versus Fact’ appeared in
The Pitt News. Reporter Harry Paras stood
outside of Hillman Library to ask students
about sex and distributed a paper survey.
The following is an excerpt of this article.

The college campus at one time had the rep-
utation of being a place where sex was wet

and wild. Students, female as well as male,

were supposedly uninhibited, lustful, experi-
mentalive and active in sexual matters.

Well, as far as Pitt today is ooncemed, that
seemed a somewhat false picture. So, I de-
cided to go to the students — armed with a
survey sheet and a notebook — themselves.
Some interesting results "came up.

Before college, most students said they had
the stereotyped image of the college sex
scene. Amale sophomore said, “I was hoping
there would be so much of it at Pitt that I could
bum myself out in the ﬁrst two years and then
be able to concentrate more on studying the
last two.”

Most males interviewed had high hopes of
ﬁnding tteasily and ‘getting it easily.

Although females thought college was much
freer sexually, many admitted to never having
thought about it much until after they went out
with a few college fellows. One freshwoman
said that just recently at a fraternity party,
about half a dozen guys approached her,
talked for a few minutes, and then asked her

I if she wanted to go upstairs.

After a few years here, attitudes change. Men
and women agreed a lot of talking about sex
goes on, but itdoesn’t reﬂect how much is ac-
tually going on. Guys generally agreed most
males are “big bullsh*tters”’ when it comes to
sexual exploits. However, there was agree-
ment among those interviewed that if you re-
ally want it, you can ﬁnd it at Pitt. Not as much
goes on as is sometimes claimed, but it’s not
true, either, that most are abstaining.

If presented with a willing female, most guys ‘

would have no qualms or moral constraints
about having sex. A junior engineering stu-
dent said, ‘‘If I’m attracted to her, and she’s
attracted to me, then I’m ready for action.”

However, these same guys thought sex was
much better in the context of some.sort of re-

s Iationship This relationship did not necessar-

db.  M

ily have to be love, or one pointing towards
marriage, but could be one of friendship. I
But all males interviewed said sex and love
were separable.

Most females, on the other hand, said they
felt sex was right for themonly in the context
of a serious relationship. Some were quick
to add that this didn’t necessarily mean mar-
riage, or a relationship that would eventually
be one of marriage. Living together was ac-
ceptable to them. However, just as many
thought a serious relationship did mean mar-
riage, and this was the only place for a full
sexual relationship. ' ‘

To the question of mutual attraction outside a
relationship, a majority of women said-even if
they were sexually attracted to ‘an unknown.

guy and he to them, it would not be all right ,

to have sex. .

' and 2013 I

If any story deserves a 38-year follow up, it’s
this one. How has the campus sex scene
changed since 1975? Is the undergraduate
population uninhibited, lustful, experimenta-
tive and active in sexual matters, as Paras

tttiernts at Pitt      

Nick Stamatakis, Assistant Opinions Editor

asked students 38 years ago? Standing out-
side of Hillman Library armed with questions
based on this article, I sought to discover the
truth. I posted an online version of the survey
on the Pitt News website, as well.

Unlike students from 1975, who felt their pre-
college stereotypes of the college sex scene
turned out to be wrong, most» today believe
their pre-college perceptions have been cor-

rect. They generally agree that while it's far.

“less raunchy than movies portray sex in col-
legs to be,” a good amount of sex happens
on campus. Only two women, a sophomore
and a junior, said there was a lot less than
they expected. I 4
However, when it comes to talking about sex,

I 82 percent of all respondents both online and

in-person believe men exaggerate about their
sex lives, although one senior man added

-they don't exaggerate to good friends. There

was far less consensus on women, however:
About half of both men and women surveyed
believe most women over-exaggerated
about their sex lives.

Most people personally expressed that sex

"Many shared the sentiment that an “emo-
tional attraction makes it better” and that “it

has more meaning” if there is a relationship.
Yet a sizable minority thinks casual friendship
is enough to constitute this emotional bond.
One senior woman claimed to have “had
some of [her] best sex with just a friend.” And
about 15 percent think that consent is all that
is necessary for great sex. Unlike the results
from 1975, in this year’s responses, there
was no noticeable difference between the
sexes in their answers on this topic. ,
When people were asked if they would try
to talk to a stranger they were sexually at-
tracted to, most people said it would depend
on the context, but that in most situations,
they would not. Many expressed anxiety or
low self-conﬁdence as inhibitors. Others said
they would only do so ifthey had been drink-
ing. Still, a sizable portion of male respon-
dents claimed to have luck with strangers:
One junior claimed “usually they approach
me first” and another freshman claimed he
“spits a good game.” _ .

Just as in 1975, people still have sex. Women
have adopted many of the beliefs previously
held primarily by‘ men but. still seem to be
more timid about approaching strangers.
When asked to describe sex, there was a
wide range of responses, ranging from sci-
entiﬁc (“intercourse”) to light-hearted (‘the

greatest way to have fun for free”) to reﬂec-

tive (“Something I so desperately believe I
require, until the rare moment in which I take

‘part in it, In which case I am left unfulfilled”).

None of the 80 people involved, online or of-

Aﬂine, mentioned the word “love.” Four, how-

ever, did call sex “intimate.” By -far, the most
popular description was “fun.”

Finally,_the same day I was standing outside
Hillman Library, a woman was passing out
religious pamphlets’ nearby. In the spirit of
investigative journalism, I decided to ask her
what she thought about sex among college-
aged people.

“I don’t think age has anything to do with it,
but until you are married, you shouldn’t do it.”
Add another opinion to the mix.

One thing I noticed during in-person sun/ey-
ing was that farfewer men seemed interested
in having this conversation than women. One
particular man, when he heard I was asking
about sex,. simply said “Oh hell no” before
storming off. My rejection rate was twice -as
high for guys; I have to wonder how well a
female sun/eyor would have done. ~

But when engaged in these conversations,

many men and women were very talkative
and open. I actually think some of them liked

talking about it. Not surprisingly, though, the
online responses were signiﬁcantly more
frank, although I suspect a bit less truthful. I

such as yourselves give it a try this Feb. 14. ‘

Begin your preparations by kicking your
roommates out — nicely, that is. You’ll want
privacy if you want any level of romanticism.

Clean up a spot in yourihouse or apart-
ment, ﬁnd a table and two chairs and set the

. table as neatly as possible. Two plates and

two sets of silverware are obviously a must,
but consider a tablecloth (or even a pretty
sheet) if your table is gross and a candle or
two for mood lighting.

Without food, you’ll have no dinner, so
let’s decide what you should cook. Although

     
  

      

it’s tempting to follow the “go big or go
home” mentality in.an attempt to impress,
it’s probably best to, think of simple clas-
sics in this instance. Italian treats such as
pasta dishes or chicken parmesan are easy
routes that evoke the enchanting nostalgia
of disgustingly cute, “Lady and the Tramp”—
esque movie scenes. ’

If you’re really looking to make an im-
pression, an easy way to go the extra mile
is creating an appetizer. Keeping with the
Italian theme, I’d suggest a simpliﬁed br-
uschetta recipe.

Just cut some crunchy French or Italian
bread into one—half—inch slices and top with
a drizzleof olive oil, a slice of tomato, a leaf
of basil (rumored to be an aphrodisiac) and a
slice of fresh mozzarella cheese. Toast those
in the oven on 250 degrees for a few minutes,
and you’ll have a warm, crunchy and ﬂavorful
start to your Valentine’s Day meal.

Follow up the ﬁrst course with a simple
entree that you feel conﬁdent throwing
together. I’ve given my recipe for chicken
parmesan alongside this column, so feel free
to follow that for a simple selection. Just be
mindful while you’re handling chicken to al-
ways wash your hands and anything that has
touched the chicken before either of those
touches anything else. Otherwise, you risk
salmonella contamination and poisoning. I
doubt you’d like to spend your night sick in
the emergencyroom.

As an inexpensive, well-paired side dish
for the chicken, I’d recommend spaghetti.

’All you have to do is cook the pasta and top .

it with the same sauce you’ll use for the
chicken. As for that sauce, I like to buy’ an

Sexual representations in video games could use some character

Thomas Visco
Stcyj’ Wrz'ter '

Since humanity sought shelter in caves, across
western Europe, we have depicted sex in any
artistic medium available. Be it on cave walls,
canvas, ﬁlm or music, sex has apersistent pres-
ence in our lives. Video games are no different.

But while it’s becoming increasingly com-
mon in the gaming industry, sexual content
has yet to establish itself as a necessity in video
games. Romantic intrigue has never hindered a
game, but including it has also never enhanced
a game’s storyline. As in ﬁlm and literature, out-
of-place sexuality is grossly obvious, and, when
done -for mere titillation, pointless.

The ﬁrst video games with sexual themes
appeared inthe early 1980s. These games were
mostly text-based, point-and-click adventure
games with limited interactivity. While unre-
markable for their gameplay, the erotic images
depicted in thegames were the ﬁrst use of com-
puter graphics to depict sexual acts. _

Simple and highly erotic, video games like
these are still prevalent in Japanese markets,
but they’ve had little success in the U.S. Instead,
sexuality as it’s gradually crept into American
games hasbeen less ﬂagrant and more focused
on smooth integration into the plots and inter-

active portions of the titles it seeks to enhance. I ’
In the past ﬁve years, remarkable innovation V

in video gamecharacterization has occurred.
Several serious, well—respected video games

include romantic storylines. Oftentimes, these

romantic entanglements are gameplay options

players can choose whether or not to pursue.

The most apparent examples of the evolution of
the genre toward sexual themes can be found in

Bioware’s role—playing games, or RPGS.

The modernization of romance in video
games began with “Star Wars: Knights of the Old
Republic” (KOTOR), a 2003 RPG based in the
Star Wars universe. This title was an immense
ﬁnancial and critical success. In the game, the
player takes on the role of either a male or fe-
male character and progresses through the
game’s story by making individual decisions.
Oftentimes, these decisions fall along a “good”
or “bad” spectrum. But some decisions can
also be made regarding the player’s romantic
pursuits with other characters in the story.

“KOTOR,” however, falls short of ﬁrst base,
never getting past the “I love you” stage.

Bioware’s next RPG franchise, “Dragon Age:
Origins,” took the idea of choice to the next
level. Structurally, “Dragon Age” is very similar
to “KOTOR” — your character can be good or
evil, there’s somerudimentaiy world-saving
quest and the player surrounds him or herself
with a team of colorful characters to aid in said
quest. The romantic options are also similar.
The player has the option to ﬂirt with other
characters, which may ultimately end in some
steamy graphically-enhanced action — techni-
cally the ﬁrst sex scenes in mainstream gaming,
although they are more suggestivethan explicit.

While the depiction of the act is thoroughly
uninteresting, “Dragon Age” takes a huge ﬁrst
step for mainstream video games. As either
a male or a female character, you can choose
between several partners as your whimsical
romantic interest, including homosexual re-
lationships. This may seem unremarkable, but
for an industry that often seeks to appeal to its
predominantly straight, white male audience,
“Dragon Age” was a big step toward equality.

Bioware’s latest entry of sex in video games
came with its “Mass Effect” series. The original
“Mass Effect” was the ﬁrst to include aﬁilly ani-
mated sex scene akin to any movie’s sex scene.
“Mass Effect’s” romantic options were also the
ﬁrst to feel like actual storytelling and charac-
terizationhrather than a needless distraction.

But the series’ sexual mastery isn’t by any
means complete. “Mass Effect 3’s” romance
options are often criticized. for resembling a
freshman—year coed dorm more than a video
game. It often seems as if the designers were
more interested in letting Shepherd run wild on
the space ship than investing in an interesting
characterization of the game’s cast. Ultimately,
gaming audiences accepted “Mass Effect’s’,’ use
of romance as a relevant storytelling trope,
albeit an unremarkable one.

While some might suggest sex in video
games simply needs more progression before
it can constitute an effortless and enjoyable ele-
ment of the gaming experience, it’s also possible
that the two weren’t meantfor each other. Point-

 

ing out what he views as the ultimate difficulty

with sex in video games, IGN writer Michael,

Thomsen summarizes the problem eloquently
in an article on the respected gaming website.
“Games are supposed to carry us away from
what we share with everyone else, creating a
personal cocoon of experience built around
someone else’s creation,” Thomsensays. “Sex;

makes the artiﬁce of games apparent because"

many of us have some ﬁrsthand inkling ofwhat
is being depicted.”

Video game storytelling is successful be-
cause it transports players to distant places,
often depraved and violent in a foreign way.
The emotions elicited by this unfamiliar jour-
ney are exciting and jarring. As players form
attachments to characters, a successful game’s
narrative contorts the player’s emotions.]ust as
many shed atear when ProfessorAlbus Dumb-
ledore dies in “Harry Potter,” so, too, are gamers

saddened when one of Commander Shepherdis _.

comrades perishes in “Mass Effect.”

B_ut sexuality in video games never helps
form this kind of attachment, and it has never
completely succeeded in engaging the player in
an emotional way. Instead, it serves as a mind-
less distraction, with little to no value for the
narrative or for the player. If sex is ever going
to be a meaningﬁil part of video games —— if
fantasy and reality are to combine effectively
—- sexhas to be employedas ameaningﬁil part
of storytelling, a feat gamers have yet to see
satisfactorily executed. I

ﬁlms. You can’t be innocently starry-eyed and
in love and be 25 or 30 now. You’ve got to be 15
 because the world has seemingly progressed
so much.” » .

Shiﬁjng portrayals .

‘ Along with the change in the portrayal of
sex and relationships, the depiction of men and
women’s gender roles has shifted over time. But
rather than balancing out, equality inportrayal
of the sexes seems to have diminished in today’s
blockbusters. Bishop described the equality
of male and female characters in the ’30s and
’4os, which she believes fostered the emotional
connection and romance between characters.

“[Men and women] were surprisingly equal
in alot of those ’30s and ’40s movies. You know,
Katharine Hepburn kicked alot ofbutt, allthings
considered. She wore pants, which was a big
deal then. She was so often paired with Cary
Grant, too  He wasn’t the macho guy atalland
he’s actually feminized in a lot of ﬁlms in comic
ways,” Bishop explained.

Kenneth Salzer, an english literature profes-
sor at Pitt, remarked onthis concept in terms of
the 1940 ﬁlm “His Girl Friday,” in which Cary
Grant and Rosalind Russell have equally witty
punch lines. .

“They both have great lines and the reper-
toire is really quick, Which is a sign to us that
they belong together because they complete
each other’s sentences,” Salzer said.

Nowadays, however, women seem to have
lost some of their equality on the big screen. Sal-
zer described how in movies such as “Bringing
Up Baby” (1938) inthe’30s and ’4os, the female
protagonist was portrayed as the spontane-
ous, ﬁm character, self-assured and conﬁdent

, and trying to loosen up her buttoned-up love

interest. _ ,
“Today — [and] I don’t think this is true
with all romantic comedies —— the woman is

l the one who seems a little more uptight, career

oriented  She’s too concerned with her job,”
Salzer said. “Now that she’s in the workplace,

where she wanted to be, it’s now consuming '

the rest of her life.”
Kurlander noted that while actors such as

.Woody Allen, Seth Rogen and Kevinjames have

aided the progression of male roles and made
the “nerdy guy” apopular protagonist, this is
not as much the case for most actresses of our

generation, with the exception of women such
as Lena Dunham, Zooey Deschanel and Tina Fey.

“There haven’t been enough women voices
 and there aren’t as many women directors,”
Kurlander said.

Bishop commented on the effect that fe-
male roles can have on younger viewers who
frequently watch movies and television. Movies
present ideas of normalcy to viewers and they
subliminally absorb these messages and incor-
porate thcm into their worldview.

“If you’re continuously seeing movies whére
the women don’t get any of the funny lines and
they end up in a traditional ‘I better get married,
I’m having a baby’ situation, it may not be great
for women viewers,” Bishop explained, point-
ing to movies such as “Knocked Up” (2007) as
having the potential to perpetuate these views.

Positive developments

But not all the changes to perspectives of
romance on the big screen have been negative.

Kurlander noted that romantic comedies
are harder to come up with now than in the
past because society has become more toler-
ant of movie portrayals that previously would
have been considered scandalous. It’s no longer
unheard of for movies to display homosexuality
or‘ interracial relationships. ‘

“It’s harder in your generation than before
because there’s not as many obstacles for people
getting together. In your generation, anything
goes. Outside of a llama and a chimp mating,

there isn’t a lot that people haven’t seen,” Kur— _

lander said. “So the good news is we’re an ac-
cepting society.” 

Kurlander also noted that there’s reason to
hope for this generation of romantic ﬁlms. He
suggested “Moonrise Kingdom” (2012) and “The

Perks ofBeing a Wallﬂower” (2012) as two recent “

movies that have included powerful themes and
an encouraging amount of tenderness.
Even some of the more recent sexually ex-

plicit  have worth undemeath their more b

overt motifs, in Kurlander’s opinion.

“The raunchy hides the heart,” he said. “I do V

think those movies have a lot of heart.”

However, especially on Valentine’s Day, it’s
important to remember that romantic com-
edies, while they may affect viewers’ perceptions
of what life and love are like, don’t always reﬂect
reality — no matter what their portrayal of sex
and romance is.‘ ' ’

“Our idea of romantic love is allthese sweep-
ing gestures. But in real life, love is something
else,” Kurlander said. I T

keeping S&M behaviors safe and healthy, Be-
iter said. .

“You negotiate a scene, and you determine
the limitations ‘each person is willing to experi-
ence,” he said.

And contrary to popular thought, he add-
ed, the submissive person — he or she in the
shackles or receiving the paddle spanks to
the butt — has situational power because of
the arbitrary safe word, a precaution many
S&M participants establish for the protection
of themselves and their partners. Once they
shout “foliage” or “pineapple” during an S&M
experience, everything stops. '

Miller said that the very ability to establish
ground rules and be on the same page as your
partner speaks volumes about the strength of
the relationship. . .

» “We got to the point where we'd go to the
sex shop together, and I think we tried pretty

' much everything in there,” she said of her four-

year relationship while at Pitt, which she has
since ended. ’ ‘

Lotz, however, said he thinks that the line
of consent becomes too muddled for those
who practice S&M. _

“If you learn to be domineering in the bed-
room, then that’s

 

problematic in life,” he said. '

‘I-Ie worries that people like Miller might
carry her experiences with her to her next
relationship, where her partner might not be
OK with it. ‘

But Beiter argues the escapist qualities of
sex provide a meaningful outlet for people. He’s
seen many male corporate executives that play

into the submissive role in S&M relationships. ' A

“In everyday life [they] have to be the guy in
charge,” Beiter said of a common persohality
type of people who engage in S&M. “They have
so much responsibility and pressure to be in
charge that they look to their sexual life as a
pleasurable escape from all that responsibility.”

Although they disagreed on the implica-
tions of S&M, both Beiter and Lotz stressed the
necessity of open lines of communication and
trust in any healthy, sexual arrangement. And
college life, hallmarked by its one-night stands
and frequently alcohol-accompanied sexual
rendezvous, might not be the ideal venue for
beginning to explore an activity that requires
such open dialogue. , _ v

jaw and pronounced brow.

“Men that have more masculine faces tend
to have more testosterone,” Cousins explained.
“This increases their ability to provide for off-
spring.” A

Nicole Somplatsky, a Pit junior majoring
in studio arts, notices some of these masculine
features in the face of her signiﬁcant other,

“Q” Owen Daly, a junior majoring in chemistry.

“I like his nose, and he’s got a pretty nice
jawline, as well,” she said. “It’s a strong jaw
line — when guys grow up, that’s one of the
features that stands out when they get their
‘man face’ in college.”

February 14, 2018 I The Pitt News | vvvvvx/.pittnevvs.Com

And the scent of his bedroom, which she
describes as “musky,” like a library or old build-
ing, is appealing to her.

Body ratio

Although men, too, have a preference for fa-
cial symmetry, they are also attracted to women
based on waist—to—hip ratio, smelland softness
of features.

“People with a lower waist—to—hip ratio tend
to be more fertile,” Cousins said. “Men [also]
like estrogen—type faces, which have softer
features.” a '

Daly notices these womanly characteristics .

in his girlfriend, Somplatsky.
“Her lips are naturally puckered — I say
that she has ‘kissy lips,”’ he said. “Even when

she’s not trying to give a kiss, it looks like she’s 1

getting ready to give a kiss, and it makes my
mind jump to kissing her. I associate the kissy
lips with getting kisses.”

Daly referenced the famous Sir Mix-A—Lot
line “when the girl walks in with the itty bitty

waist and the round thing in your face” as being

a preference of his own.

“I’m kind of an ass man,” Daly said. “Some-
thing about that hourglass shape. Ithink it has
somethingto do with the geometry of it—the
two triangular shapes of the hourglass, whereas
I feel either more linear or more like a single
triangle or trapezoid.”

He also enjoys the scent of her hair, which
is dissimilar from the musk of his own.

“She has a lot of hair, and the smell of the

natural oils, even if it’s not right after she show-
ers — if it’s in the morning or something— the

4 natural oils just make me happy,” Daly said. “It

smells a lot different from my own.”

Cycles of attraction

According to Cousins, studies show that
men think women look best when they are
naturally ovulating. _

“There’s a lot of human sexuality that is
linked to female cycling, so there are scents and

cues including changes in the face in women -

who are cycling during their peak ovulation
periods,” Cousins said. “[A woman’s] face be-
comes more ﬂushed and things like that.”

She explained that during ovulation, wom-
en’s faces naturally produce the effects of “what
people tend to use more makeup for, like lip-
stick and blush.” ' '

Cousins indicated that these innate desires
can also be explained by the Darwinian “sur-
vival of the ﬁttes ” and a genuine interest of
heterosexual beings to reproduce.

“Women have a speciﬁc window in which
they can have offspring —— men don’t have that

A V window. And there’s a lot more time and effort

and_resources involved [on the part of women]
when [they] have kids,” Cousins said. “So that’s
one of the rationales for why you ﬁnd this kind
of gender divide for what men and women ﬁnd
attractive.” '

Skills outside of the physical

An individual’s sex appeal is not solely restrict-
ed to appearance and smell, Morehouse added.
Certain talents also play a role in attraction,
and these talents can be thought of in terms
of sensory operation —— the way somebody
looks can also‘ include the way that-they move.

“Dancing is very important '— there have
been a ‘number of studies that show a male’s
ability to dance is a really important criteria
for female choice,” Morehouse said. “It may
tell females something about how coordinated
he is, which may be linked to his quality or his
health or his developmen .”

Furthermore, musical skill also has the
potential to communicate more than some
sweet—soundingt11nes, ;

“Music is connected to intellectual sophis-

tication and ﬁne motor skills that may be im-

portant to females when they’re looking for a
mate,” Morehouse said.

Daly is in aband with friends at Pitt, and he
playsboth the saxophone andguitar. As a fan
of his, Somplatsky is attracted to his ability to
come up with lyrics to accompany his band’s
instrumentals. ' '

“He writes songs, too, sometimes, and you

A have to have a goodmind to compose stuff like

that and be creative,” she said. A V

It must be remembered that all of these‘at—
tractions are unconscious, Cousins noted. For
all of those who enjoy romantic comedies, the

' intrusion of science into the realm of romance

does not mean thatthere cannot be fairytale
endings. . v . ‘ '
“People don’t know that they ﬁnd somebody
attractive because they don’t match on their
genes or they’re very symmetrical,” Cousins
said.-“Even thoughwe might have these things,
it doesn’t‘ mean [sexual attraction] is prede-
termined.” I ' V

health. In the 2012 Trojan Sexual Health Report
Card, a survey of universities across the country
that grades each school based on its student
health center, Pitt ranked No. 19 out of the 141
universities. Included in this assessment is the

amount of information about sexual health A

available on the school’s website, the availabil-
ity and cost of condoms on campus, and the
resources about sexual health.

As a past member of the CWO board, Sul-
livan used her time on the board to research
Pitt’s policy on condom and birth-control dis-
tribution and found that students could access
condoms for free if they approached CWO, but
that information about availability was lacking. '
She believes in taking away stigma fromproper
sexual health, saying that not providing infor-
mation will not stop people from having sex.

According to the American College Health

- Association’s survey from 2008 to 2012, 48 per-

cent of the 76,481 surveyed students reported
having sex within the last 30 days. Of these
students, 18.3 percent reported having always
used some form of contraception.

The proponents of Sanapala’s initiative
frame it in an educational context. Alexander

Hess, founder of LGBT Outreach Initiative, .

pointed out that condoms work well when used
‘ properly, and educational materials ought to be
provided with each condom.
_ “Condom distribution and condom educa-
tion needs to go hand in hand,” Hess said.
Sanapala agreed, adding that providing con-

' doms in kits with instructions could be easily

done. ~

Involving Student Health

initiative agree that improving sexual health
care on campus will improve the University

our fellow students, and we think that having
prophylactics available is a good way to do that,”
Sullivan said. “You hear stories about other
schools where there are just condoms every-
where, and that is not the case here.” ‘

At Shippensburg University in Shippens— *

burg, Pa., avending machine in the _university’s
student health center dispenses Plan B One-
Step, an emergency contraceptive commonly
called the “morning—after pill,” for $25. It also
sells condoms and pregnancy tests that vary
in prices. .

Shippensburg Spokesman Pete Gigliotti said
Plan B and condoms are already available over
the counter, so the vending machine simply
improves accessibility.

Gigliotti also said access to the machine
required a university ID card and that revenue

from the machine has varied from year to year
since its inception in20o9. He added that Ship-
pensburg’s administration didn’t model this
program after another college.

“We found what was most appropriate for
the institution,” Gigliotti said.

Hess said that as of 2011, 86 percent of U.S.
colleges including Penn State University and the

, University of Maryland provide free condoms.

Considering that statistic, Hess wonders
why Pitt does not provide the same service, as
the proper use of condoms could cut down on
the spread of STIs.

V Director of Student Health Services Marian
Vanek said that SHS offers similar services.

“The SHS provides Pitt students with ser-
vices and resources to make informed decisions
regarding their sexual health and responsibil-

ity,” Vanek said in an email.

Even so, Vanek has so far shown a great deal
of support for Sanapala’s initiative.

“We understand that college students need
access to honest and credible sexual-health

infomiation and services,” Vanek said. 

Although Sanapala admitted that itwilltake
alongtime for condoms to appear in campus
areas such as residence halls, she said that mak-
ing them accessible for free at Student Health
— and letting students know aboutthem —will
be the ﬁrst major step in her initiative. _

If the University implements Sanpala’s initia-
tive at Student Health, condoms will be avail-
able‘ in packets that include instructions. Each
packet would hold about two or three condoms,
so no student would be able to snag more than

necessary. !
