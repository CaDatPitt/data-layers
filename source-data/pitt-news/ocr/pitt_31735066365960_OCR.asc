J Posvar tours housing

/

by DAVE BLUEY
The red-haired. bushy eyebrow-

given many students quite a
start-for t.he unexpected visitor
was none other than Chancellor
Wesley Posvar. on a surprise tour
of campus housing facilities. ’ ‘
Posvar summed up his impres-
sions of the areas. "The conditions
in the Towers are very bad." he
observed. "Much of this is the re-
sult of vandalism. but the Univer-
sity is also at fault. I feel that the
students would take pride in the
facilities if they were kept in good
condition.‘
“Quality is
pride,” he added.
Posvar regarded quite favor-

important for

‘ably the living conditions in Hol—'

land Hall. “The Towers are really
in poor‘ shape when you compare
them to these gdormitories.“ he
stated. / i

The Chancellor found the soror-
ity suites a real living experience
for the girls‘, noticeably impress-
ed by the sister—initiated improve-
ments.

Pan-Hel President Sue Ruffner
"explained that the sororities are
responsible for the funding of fur-
nishings and upkeep of the suites.
Even maid service is provided
through the organizations.

Ruffner noted, however. that
the groups sometimes encounter
difficulty in completely filling the
suites on both sides. And "if we"
cantfill them "completely." she
concluded. "the Housing office

Democratic committeeman post 

by MIKE MILLER

Martin S. Rosenzweig, a Tower
B resident, is running for the of-
fice of Democratic Committee-
man for the Fourth Ward which
includes the dorm area and Schen-
ley Farms. He is hoping to use his
position t.o "involve students in
the grass roots of county politics."

Rosenzweig stressed the tre-
power student voters
can exercise in the county. If all
of the 3.500 dorm students were
registered in this area. the Sixth
District would be. by far, the larg-
est in the City and would probably
be divided into several districts.

Even if only 700 students were
registered it would be enough to
make the dorm area a separate
district and insure that a student
would hold the office of commit-
teeman. added Rosenzweig.

Though the office of committee-
man is the least significant in the
party. Rosenzweig feels that he
can have considerable impact in
the county.

According

to Rosenzweig 15

people can call a convention_ of the»

entire county. Several other stu-

dents are running for county of-,,
. fices. If elected they will be‘.ab_le 1

 

  

to organize and call such conven-
tions and suggest party reforms.

“The office of committeeman is
the smallest party office, but it's
the office closest to the people,”
he explained. .

"reform on the local level.

"There hasybeen significant re-
form on the national level but its
been slow getting down to the 10-
cal level," he said. V ’

He contended that the county con-
ventions can be used as a vehicle
for reform.

The student vote, he feels. will
make or break him. He is trying
to encourage students to register
in this district and obtain absen-
tee ballots, since the elections will
take place after most students
have gone home for the summer.

"The question is ‘What will the
students do?‘ and the worst an-
swer is that they will do nothing."
he said. He stated that if the col-
lege students in the city would
organize. they could muster
enough voting power to elect a leg-
islator.

“Now is the time to be active,”
he emphasized. He stated that po-
liticians are concerned about the
vote and students must act now to
show them that the student vote
is a legitimate concern.-

students have done so—when the
Housing officia-ls threatened to

— make them pay for damage." '

At another point in the tour, the

' party was abruptly shaken as a

firecracker exploded only a few
feet away.

The incident prompted the Chan-

cellor to question the effective-

ness of the dorms’ Resident As-
sistants. '

When touring the Towers cafe-
teria at dinner, Posvar expressed
concern over the small number
of ‘workers present at a period
when they seemingly should be
relatively busy.

JA Szabo manager explained,
“Well, we prepare the food in ad-
vance—and ' during_ serving time
the kitchen is rlathergempty.”

"Is it edible?" When offered .a 7
chance to sample the fare, he de-_-. ;
clined with a polite. "No, thank: 
you.“ 3 A . 

The inspection concluded‘ with‘ 
a tour of Amos Hall, which houses,  .
the sorority suites. Moving across’ '

son, treasurer.

Ruffner plans programs
and goals for sororities

by/CHUCK STEEBER

A new Pan-Hellenic administra-
tion has been elected and with the
new administration comes
changes in the sorority system.
The most radical and probably the
most important at this time is the
new rush system Pan-Hel will be
using this coming Fall.

Sue Ruffner of Delta Zeta. ‘the
new Pan—Hel president. explained
the new system. Rush will begin

I about the first or second week of

September for upperclass women
and run for three weeks. Shortly
after that freshman rush will
start. lasting about six weeks. At
the end of this time a woman may
pledge the sorority of her choice.

There were several reasons for
the change. In the past rush has
run from October to January. The
change will mean more time for

the freshman sorority mem-

ber to engage in other activities.
It will also get the new sorority
girl into the chapter and the deci-
sion-making process quickly.

Rush statistics. in comparison
with‘past years. have shown a de-
crease this year. The reason
cited for the poor rush were finan-
cial and the long rush period.
Ruffner pointed out that even
though rush did poorly here at
Pitt it is doing well across the na-
tion. making the point that soror-
ities are growing. not declining.

’Ruffner contended that soror-
ities are very relevant to the'Uni-
versity, since many of Pitt‘s most
active women are also in the
Greek system. The sorority helps
t6/stimulate the interests of new
sororitywomen. Ruffner added.

GRADUATE SCHOOL

Eleanor Jones
will. be held at Heinz Chapel on
Thursday, April 13 from 4-5 

$$$

   

 

Ruffner commented, “A- new
sister enters a‘ main stream of
activity when she joins a sorority.
This doesn’t mean only social as-
pects. A sorority’Rc'iiﬁ‘?’6ffer‘9st'
ulation and help in Academics,
service projects and culture. A
sorority has as many facets as
the women in the sorority.”

She also made note of the use-
fulness of the Greek ‘system to
the community. in that during
Greek Week over 322 of blood
were donated to Central Blood
Bank. and over $12.000 raised for
charity. ,

Besides the new rush system.
Ruffner‘s administration will con-
tinue to’ coordinate the pledge
programs. service events. and

‘other system wide events of the
-sororities.

She also said she hopes to keep
open dialogue between the com-
munity and other Greek organiza-
tions, review, analyze and im-
prove projects. of past years,
and to‘ educate the University on
just what the sororities are :and
what they stand for.‘

She concluded by sa_ving.'‘‘Sor—

, ority women are individual wom-'

en who just happen to be in a "sor-
ority."

Other Pan-Hellenic officers are
Ursula Kingsley. vice president:
Sharon Regan. secretary. and
Mary Lee Wilson. treasurer.

Feature Editor

Glenn Williams. Republican
candidate for State Treasurer. is
quite concerned about the fate of
the excess money collected from
the State Income Tax. "Governor
Shapp tricked the legislature into
levying a higher tax than was
needed . . E. and now he has in-
creased his 72-73 budget to spend
the excess on welfare." Williams
said.

Williams was at Pitt for a cam-

(paign speech Wednesday night.

“The governor promised many
lucrative programs would result
from the income tax, but I haven’t
seen any of them yet,” Williams
complained. He said that the
state government needs a system
§iS<=_a.l.9l_1s=cks,and balances.-. “In
e" ' last ‘eléﬁtfﬁh the Democratic
candidate for Treasurer claimed.
Democratic Treasurer should be
elected to watch over the Republi-

 
    

can Governor. Now that we have a -
_ Democratic Governor I think the

same thing should hold true,” Wil-
liams grinned. “We need a Re-
publican Treasurer,” he added.

Williams cited several instances
of what he termed "Democratic
mismanagement of funds." A
member of Governor Shapp‘s cab-
inet. Deputy Secretary of Proper-
ties and Supplies Charles Adler".

bought the Harrisburg'Hotel for
$1, million. then leased it back to
the‘ state for ten years at a cost
of $4.1 million. Williams revealed.
Normally. contracts are granted
for only five years. according to
Williams. I

— ‘Williams also complained of the

purchase of a jet airplane for the
Governor at a cost of one-half

imillion dollars. "That plane can
only land at four airports in the .
I entire state." Williams retorted.

Another scandal which incensdd
Williams was the “question of the

“These are some of the reasons
for having a person from the min-
ority party serving as the State
Treasurer who is in a position to
stop such transactions." Williams
said.

" ~ _.an easy enough matter to clarif ’

During the nearly fouryears
that I have been enrolled as an
undergradudate student at Pitt.
‘many students — and students
from other universities — have
asked me why there has been a
minimal amount of what the me-
dia has termed. “campus unrest"
at Pitt. Although there are many
contributing factors. I never fail-
ed to mention our non-reactionary
Campus Police Force. According

‘to my observations they treated

the students in a humane. tact-
ful manner. and were consequent-
ly regarded with the respect that
is due to fair and honest officer
of the law. ‘
Because my identification was
stolen from my dormitory room
during my first year at Pitt, I
have had no proof of my identity
as a student other than my vali-

dated invoices. I had found that

    1...... to the Editor

this was always sufficient except
athletic events, which held only
minimal interest for me anyway.
In over three years I had never
been denied admission to any
University building or non-athle-
tic event until the date of the
writing of this letter.

On Monday, April 3, 1972. I
was denied admission to Trees
Hall by the officer on duty check-
ing identification. He did not
seem interested in the fact that I
had a validated invoice for this
term, a non-University identifi-
cation with my picture on it
(proving that the name on the
invoice was mine); and my regis-
tration slip for Spring Term. I
have been admitted to Trees Hall
by the Campus Police officer on
duty every day that I chose to
use the facilities, which has been
quite frequently, with the above-

Crime symptom of sick

by PAM STEFFEY
If crime is a symptom of sick-
ness in a society, the" modern
American culture is one of the
sickest around. For one of the
most universally abhorrent

crimes of all human history, rape, ‘

is not diminishing, but increasing

in frequency at the present time. _

According to statistics publish-
ed in the Pittsburgh Forum, over
300 rapes occurred in Pittsburgh
alone in 1970. Beyond the sim-
ple talk of how women can pro-
tect themselves from becom-
ing victims of rapists (such as
avoidingdark streets or carrying
a hatpin), we need_inquiry into
why this crime exists in our so-
ciety.

The majority of rapes, many’

of them unreported, occur in sit-
uations where a woman goes
out with‘ a man she doesn’t know

‘very well. Here there is a fine

line between rape ‘and seduction.
The rapes. that occur on adark

street . at knifepoint should be
reclassified as aggravated assault.
This would facilitate convictions
from these charges and do away
with the ’stigma that keeps wom-
en from reporting these crimes.

But seduction-rape situations
are more common; and are more
directly related tothe social con-
ditioning that defines masculine
and feminine behavior.

To.look at present day cultur-
al "mating patterns’- is to un-
derstand why these rapes are so
prevalent. Man is the aggresive
pursuer of woman, who is taught,
on her part, to with hold sexual

— favors for the payoff of marriage

and security. Theimage of wom-
an as a sexual object is evident
in magazines such as Playboy
and in women’s fashion, hair-
styles", and cosmetics. Women'en—
vtice men to the point of sexual
intercou-rsefwhile man is taught
to interpret the women’s “no” as
a "maybe,” and a “maybe” as

 

mentioned identification.

I believe that the actions of the
officer in question went beyond
protection of University property.
He admitted to me that he was de-
nying me admission to Trees
Hall just to be obstinate. He also
told me that he would arrest me
for disorderly conduct if 1 com-
plained to him.

I am sorry to see that evident-
ly the era of the "good cop" is
over at the University of Pitts-
burgh. I only hope that the plea-
sure afforded this officer by
manipulating others does not
cause an eruption of violence.

a "yes.” The masculine model
of behavior is the Playboy image
of cool, carefree sexual encoun-
ters, while the feminine ideal
is an active social life surround-
ed by an admiring throng of

men, or at least one, with no sex
life implied. It is -these conflict-

-ing modes of behavior that result

in rapes seduc-

tions.

Blaming the ills of" society'on
society at large accomplishes
nothing in the way of changing
the status quo. But each one of

bordering on

us can examine ourselves with_

regard to changing stereotyped
masculine or feminine behavior.
A mass.change in individuals
could effect a great change in
society that would eliminate the
games played between the sex-
es. If no woman were willing
to po_se for the centerfold then
there would be no reality to the
masculine fantasy of viewing all
women as sex objects.

S. G. inconveniences organizations

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD
Staff Writer

The Student Choral Commun-

ity, Men's Glee Club, Women‘s
Choral, and Heinz Chapel Choir

sat through a four and one half.

hour meeting Tuesday, but re-

-ceived little satisfaction or sup-

port from Student Government.

The board remained" divided at
the close of the meeting over the
issue of defining Public Rela-
ytionsaorganizations.

The fact that they could not

agree, on whether the Choral .

groupswere public relations or-
ganizations led them to accept
the allocations committee recom-
mendations, some $13,000.00 less
than the combined request, with
the contingency that if monies
could not be found elsewhere in
the University they could re-apply

through the allocations commit-i

tee under Emergency Allocations.
Committments have already been
made and as it stands now, the
groups do not have the funds t
fulfill their obligations. ‘

The debate between the sev-
en Board members and 15 mem-
bers of the Choral organizations
raged for over an hour and a
half.

The opinionated and diverse
stands of t-he Board over the fund-
ing of the organizations stems
from a lack of cohesive organi-
zation.

L Such an issue as defining the
role of an organization should be

:_I: I.

Perhaps it would have been, as
several Board members asserted,
had the time not been so late.

The funding of concert travel
was brought up at a. meeting al-
most four weeks ago. But appar-
ently no clarification was sought
and no further examination car-

. ried out.

Time wasted in the dialogue
was unnecessary and in poor
consideration to the Choral mem-
bers who waited‘ for two hours
before their review even came up.

Whether the /funding of Glee
Club, Women’s_Choral and Heinz
Chapel Choir should be contin-

ued by Student Government or as
public relations groups funded
by the University is an important
matter.

If the Student Government
Board had intended not to fund
concerts or camps, they should
have either notified the groups
earlier or taken it upon them-
selves as our elected body to find
out what the alternatives were.

Poor organization on the part
of Student Government was un-
necessarily responsible for at the
least inconveniencing the Choral
members and, unfortunately. at
worst putting them in a very pre-
carious situation.

Marchers T... (Wu ruin

by LYNN ALSTADT
Pitt Band Member

Dissention between members of the Pitt Varsity Marching Band
and its new director, Edmund Williams, has become so serious that the
Band may not march next year. The bandsmen, disgusted with the Uni-
versit_v's refusal to replace Williams as director. fear that his in-
experience could destroy the Bands outstanding reputation.

The bandsmen have pointed out Williams‘ inadequacies and fail-
ings as a conductor during the past year. An insepction of Williams’
dossier fails to reveal any conducting experience before his arrival
at Pitt. He attempted _in vain to arbitrarily change the 60 year tradi-
tions and marching style of the Band. causing severe conflict within
the group. During the Stadium Review, he broke down on the podium
because he did not know how to stop the Band.

Recently, we learned that he has requested an outsider to arrange
the Band’s shows next season—even though that outsider plans to sell
the arrangements to high school bands. Lack of confidence has prompt-
ed the lowest participation of Bandsmen in winter Band activities in
many years. This has led Williams to recruit large numbers of students
from outside the University. In fact, he has even promised the Wind

Ensemble that at least one Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra member '

will join the Ensemble by Friday. It is not known whether this musi-
cian will receive union wages for his performance. '

Fearing a humiliating public appearance at the first football game
next fall. concerned alumni are planning now to withhold financial sup-
port from the University until the situation is corrected. These activ-
ities could seriously hamper the University's current fund-raising cam-
paign. and may affect Pitt’s state appropriations. which will be review-
edby the Pennsylvania Senate Appropriations Committee next week.

It is unfortunate that the University iswilling to risk the reputation
of the Band and the University‘s financial‘ stability rather than rectify
its_0wn mistake. ‘

one considers that this was a

It the Academy .-\\\'é,tl'tlS. as John Simon (ubi-
quitous critic ot The New Leader) once observ-
ed. were taken simply as an excuse for Bob Hope to
peddle his jokes. and for Hollywood to show off its
expensively tacky togs and hairdos. there might be
nothing objectionable about the event,

However. since they are taken seriously by mil-.

lions of people (anyone who doubts this should check
the Nielsen ratings) unfortunately eqt/tat, the .-\ca-
demy Awards with true cinematic achievement. I
have decided to list my predictions as well as lny
objections.

This year’s presentations ’will be made on

' Monday night,,April10, at 10 on NBC.

, The first and foremost category is. of course.
for best film. This year‘s list of nominees includes
two blatant anachronisms. Fiddler on the Roof and
Nicholas and Alexandria, as well as Stanley Ku-

‘brickfs A Clockwork Orange, William Friedkins
' The French Connection,.and Peter Bogdanovichs

The Last Picture Show. That the latter ‘three belong.

there is little doubt. But what in Cecil B. de Milles .

name are those two mammoth relics of the past do-
ing there‘? How the Hollywood establishment can
pass up Carnal Knowledge, The Conformist, Gimme
Shelter, or even Summer of ’42 in favor of those
two dinosaurs is somewhat incomprehensible.

Yet when one. considers that throughout the
sixties the Academy was still giving the Oscarto

such “artistic. low budget" lilms as The Sound of
Music, My Fair Lady-, and Oliver, it is certainly par

for the mediocre mentality of the Academy to have

_ at least nominated these two big budget blockbust-

ers. Besides. it's the year of nostalgia and now that
thestudio system is finally dead (one of the best
things that ever happened to the American cinema)
how many multimillion dollar movies are still be-

' ing made‘? I guess it is a sort of popular paean to the

Hollywood‘s putrid past.

This current nostalgiclunaey is _so strong, in
fact, that I feel the Academy will selectvThe Last
Picture Show as best film. After all, it is one of

those pictures dealing ‘nicely with the past but’

is irrelevant to the present, something ‘both the
mass audience and the Academy like. That the film
is imitative (especially of that truly great film,
Hud), misdirected and somewhat confused about
its own aims and pretentions, doesn’t matter since

the best films rarely (Patton and Marty were acci- _

dents)'win anyway.

Personally.I liked The French Connection much
better. It is anunconipromisingly hard (but honest)
look-~at some of the problems of lanatically enforc-
ing morality in todays urban jungles. But since
present day reality is generally abhored by the
Academy. which would rather revel in the much
less troublesome past. I doubt if Connection has any
chance of clicking for an upset. Thus it will unfor-
tunately be the intinitely inferior Last Picture
Show for the top prize.

‘Best .»\ctor‘.’ Here justice will probably prevail
and Gene Hackman should receive a well deserved
Oscar for his bravure performance as Jimmy “Pop-
eye" Doyle. the psychotic policeman in The French
Connection." Jean Fonda (Klute) should also be a
shoo—in for her role as a high class hooker. Both at

' least. deserved their nominations.

But the film flunkies section (also known as the
Supporting Actor and Actress Awards) is a differ-
ent story. Though both Ben Johnson (whom I hap-
pen to admire very much), for his role as Sam the
Lion (Last Picture Show) and Ann-Margret (Car-
nal Knowledge) are also sure winners; the tragedy
is that the truly great performances were not even
nominated. ' »

Michael Greer (Who?). the relatively unknown
actor who played the homosexual character
Queenie. in the prison play and film. Fortune and

Men's Eyes, was far superior to anyone I have

seen this'year—in any category. However. he; like
Susan George (Straw Dogs) was snubbed by
the supercilious snobs who make upthe Academy.
Also overlooked were Maureen Stapleton (Plaza
Suite). Bruce Dern (Drive, He Said). and Riccardo
Cucciolla and Gian'l\/Iaria Volonte (Sacco and‘ Van-
zetti). . A .
g It just goes to prove that aging actors and ac-
tresses. sound mixers. gatfers. cinematographers
and the other cinema "'crat'tsmen" who make up the
- nominating committee of- the Academy do not know
a thing about acting or art in the cinema.
If you are still notconvinced that the Academy
' does not know what it is doing, then look at their lu-
dicrous list_of foreign film nominations. I can ‘under-
stand the. nomination of Vittorio De Sica’s The Gar-
den of the Finzi-Contini's '( the probable winner) but
what of the other four? They are: Tchaikovsky
(Russian), The Immigrant (Sweden), The Police-
man (Israel) ‘and Dodes-Ka-den (Japan). The fun-
ny (sad?) thing about these four flops is that

 by DEBRA DUNCAN
There is currently an art show
Tat" the Lutheran Center at 4515
‘Forbes ‘Ave. The show is by Doni
ilver—an. artist. teacher. and
tudenttat the University. I saw
he"show. last week. but came
“away feeling I had missed a great
‘5deal-—that my untrained eye was
'o_t'f sensitive enough to pick up
what the artist-was trying to get
me to see. They say that the ar-
‘7'tvi'stgis the artist's work. and visa
fersa; perhaps I could under-
,tand the work better if I under-
stood the artist. So I decided to
alk to her about art and being an
, rtist.

'-We went to the corner drug
‘tot9..g£9 has.?JS.. I

wish the waitress had been more
efficient with the coffee. forl was
struggling to wake up my mind to
ask some intelligent questions.
Luckily. one of us was awake
— its not too difficult getting
an artist of any kind to talk
about her work. We began dis-
cussing art generally. “Art is so
much broader than a painting tell-
ing a story. It affects you person-
ally and intimatel_v-it has the po-
tential to change people. Art is
made to affect change. It is and al-
ways should be communicative."
Doni said.

“It’s not as glamorous as most
people think. If you can do some-
thing other than art, do it. It’s a
hell of a lot of work.” I guess we

— outside the art world are some.-

i

, H 3’ ,what oblivious to ;.what goes into a‘
nfinivshédgi piece ;.of work. Perhaps
- . we should try it ourselves some-

times.

I was under the impression that
people are usually born artists-
my own rationalization for not be-
ing talented. no doubt. But. sur-
prisingly. the artist said "no."
"Talent and interest are similar
enough. so that a dedicated per-
son can find some fieldof art to
enter.“ 1 had expected Doni. as an
artist. to tell me that. look. if you
don't have it. you never will. Some
people have it. sortie don't. But.
like Richard Nixon always says.
he got where he is now. not
through superior intelligence. but
by trying harder. I guess the
same applies to the field of art. It
is an opinion which should encour-
agemany ambitious people seek-
ing a career in art.

We moved then from the gener-
al to the specific. Doni discussed
her work and what art means to
her. "My show is an overview of
what I can do. There are etchings.
lithographs. and paintings. I sup-
pose the most significant part is
the figure deviation—because my
main interest is the figure. As an

the viewer—-peopLl,e become more
involved with the’ piece. both psy-
chologically and philosophically."
I found myself agreeing. for mere
squares and circles have never
moved me. But yet I thought that
was mo're a deficiency of not un-
derstanding abstract art. It was
comforting to know most people
react the same way.

Doni explained that her work
communicated the g“human condi-
tion.” It deals with the relation-

ship of man to man and man to his.

environment. “It is a problem
solving situation,” she explained.
Sex also plays a large part in her
work, sex as a prime motivator of
man. “In my work I deal with the
compatibility and inconsistency
of emotional and physical rela-
tionships,” Doni related.

Lip until this time we had been
talking about_the artist communi-
cating with the viewer. saying
something to him. But. on the
other side. it became clear that
Doni as an artist gets a great deal
of satisfaction from her work. She
paints not only for the viewer. but
for herself. It shows when she
talks of art—the eyes widen and a
smile prevails. "Painting is com-

it keeps me __sane.".It sounded fan-

’ tastic; if ‘only all of us could say

our work keeps us sane. Perhaps
theres room for a beginning ar-
tist.-—\'cry dedicated and willing
to learn.

We talked of the value of school
to Doni‘s work—~or rather she did.
"School cuts down your experi-
mental period—the time when you
are looking to new subjects and
.materials.- the time when you go
beyond pencil and pen. when you
discover there's more than oil
paints.

“It is something you would do

on your _own-—-but the whole pro-
cess is speeded by being with peo-
ple who have gone through it.
Those people stimulate you — you
learn from their mistakes. And
the competition is good.” She be-
lieves that after a period school
becomes unnecessary for the ar-
tist—but_ each artist must decide
when that time is. When an artist
becomes sufficiently independent
and disciplined the pressures of
school are no longer needed. Doni
plans to remain in school, for she
still sees it as contributing to her
art. She also sees graduate school
in the future.

.£.s£>:-z.- -

Doni talked easily of her de- 
partment. "The people here are,

good. They are more than will-
ing to give you their time. They
give you information you would
not expect from professional peo-

ple—inl'ormation sortie would call,

trade secrets. It's an advantage
of a small .department." It sou-nd-
ed like an ideal situation—a per-
sonalized department with the ad-
vantages of a large university and

. city environment.

We were out of time. and I was
sorry. I could havellistened for
another hour. My short trip into
the artists world made me want
to go back to the Lutheran Center
to look for the artist in the artist's
work..I think I missed her the
first time.

Art  faculty reveals divers

enamel on steel. His three alum-
inum sculptures are very imagin-
atively designed.

Even' better than his sculptures
are his enamels on steel, which
employ‘ some of the brightest,
sharpest, and most resonant col-
ors I have ever seen. The designs
are abstract, but not totally so, as
they represent certain patterns
which inspire each work’s respec-
tive title. ‘Mitosis and Formation
II are especially commendable.

The polyester resin prism con-
structions of Thomas Brunger
employ a great simplicity of
form along with an effective use
of light, while splashing color onto
a pure white wall. The total effect
is a beautiful one and Brunger and

Cantini’s works are among the-

-best of the show.

as being labeled very appropri-
ately show fine talent and a great
sense of design; I especially en-
joyed her lithograph entitled
Change. This simple black and

-white composition, showing two

changes in color and shape, was

‘well done, as was the rest of her

work.
Edward Powell has an admir-

‘ able talent for pleasing viewers,

but I, for one, cannot appreciate
his work. David Keeton also has
an imaginative sense of design

‘and color, but to me, his composi-

tions lack interest and appear to
be out of place in comparison to
the rest of the exhibition. His Vio-
let Squares shows his evident tal-
ent for color and design.

The Multi-Visual Special Com-
positions Two Through Six are the
work of Girts Purins. These com-
positions, along with Thomas La-
cey’s works in plexiglass and ace-
tate. lack something in compari-
son to the show as a whole.

I- truly enjoyed the watercolors

 

e   creativify-  

of Robert Qualters, but his acrylic
and oil compositions“ give. the
viewer an extremely harsh pic-
ture. He uses very light colors, of-
ten a bright white every time he
wants to show shadow. This

-sharp, piercing color is objection-

able. His style seems simplistic
and often very childlike, and uses
wide range of "colors not neces-
sarily complementary to one an-
other. The colors appear to re-
semble. those of the 19th cen-
tury French artist Pierre Bon-
nard. Bonnard is referred to as an
“intimist” because he seemed to
have his own interpretations of
what life really is. Qualters seems
to have reflected this same type
of view.

Ming Fay may be called the
most controversial artist of the
entire exhibit. An entire room is

’ devoted tohis work, done in stain-

less stell cable, aluminum, lead
and steel pipe, plexiglass, and
sand. I cannot accept his sculp-

Fay sets up a metal cable, and -1
encloses it with a layer of sand
upon the floor, with metal balls at-
tached in an abstract fashion.-~
Even so, his wall “sculpture,” is
more easily comprehensible ‘ as
elements of line are shown. Ele-
ments of position and form are
also obviously present, givinghis -
work a kind of continuity.

His acrylics are indeed another’.-
story. These interesting orbit-lik_e
compositions in pastel color and ij
its “lessening” makes his work jg
interesting. The abstract position
of the stars or dots makes one’;
think that he is viewing the same 
thing that he just saw on the f loor,-l_
but in color. Ming Fay’s a'cry'lics-
are indeed creative ones.  S

In retrospect, the exhibition as
a whole is a fine representation of '
the diversity of talent present in‘
our arts department. Make an at: i
tempt to see it if possible. _ ‘

Like the baseball players. band
members threaten to strike it con-
ditions within the organization
are not improved. -

Charles Schlotter, five year
veteran of the band, felt that a
majority of the Pitt Varsity Mar-
ching Band (VMB) “would not
return next fall for the season if
Mr. Williams is retained.”

The specific complai_nts of the

- members center around charges

of poor conducting ability. lack
of technical expertise with march-
-mg bands. haphazard selection
process. and_ a lack of proficien-
cy in arranging music.

Band members first notified’ the
administration of their disgust
with Williams last December. The
issue was reopened. when a band
member found a letter dated
‘March rot‘ 1972 between Williams
and James Curnow. director of
bands atthe Genesee Commun-

lity Collegein Flint. Michigan.

The letter; discusses the possibili-

ty of Curnow arranging football ’
shows for the VMB's 1972 season. g_
The letter also mentions possi--

ble resale of the shows by Curn-
ow to other organizations.

“This is an unprecedented
move,” according toiband mem-
ber, Lynn Alstadt, “because foot-
ball shows have always been en-
gineered by Pitt band directors.
The style of music, as well as. the
formations, have. always been
_uniqu;e togt/he Pitt VMB and con-
tributed to our nationwide reputa-
tion.” ‘ A '  -

In a telephone interview with
the PITT NEWS, Williams said
that he and Robert Kidd. assist-
ant director. will arrange the fall‘
shows.

Although the VMB has been
asked by Casimir Myslinski.
University Athletic Director. to
perform in tomorrow's Blue-Gold
game‘. Williams is not fielding

‘ the band. since the event is sche-

duled during the reading period.

"We aren‘t allowed to schedule
student activities during the read- .
ing period." Williams said.

“That’s- never stopped us be-

.fore,”‘ tuba player, Ted Michalik

responded. “Isn’t the football
team a_ student activity, too?”

However. Williams is optimistic
about the future of the VMB and
hisassociation with Pitt.

"Problems can be worked out
within the band." he said. "The
University is not going to .fire
me."

, ,ba-ll season begins in the fall. . '

In The coaching staff has spent all spring in preparation for to-
morrow’s revealer. Head football coach DePasqua contends that he
}will make up his mind, sometime after the Blue/Gold game, about the
_future of the newly installed Wishbone offense.

 "'I’ve been very pleasedgwith the Wishbone so far,” DePasqua
says, "but I’m anxious to see how we execute it under game con-
iitions. How well we operate it tomorrow will certainly be a factor
.in.our,final decisions.” ‘
 To hear DePasqua talk all spring, one would assume the Wish-
bone was here to stay.But the head mentor contends that’s not the.
case. ’ A

/-“-We’ve spent a simple and basic spring.“ continued the graying
tutor. ,"The Wishbone has not been tested in game conditions and

The game will almost resemble a real contest. The quarters will

Wishbone offense for the fall season.

’ .“The receivers we had last year (Joel Klimek. Steve Moyer,
and Doug Ginden) are gone,” continued DePasqua. “there is not
much else we can do. The only guy -we have back is (Leslie)
Block, he’s a good one. The rest are all new people."

Block will miss the game tomorrow as he is still nursing his

injured shoulder.

DePasqua has stressed progress instead of perfection all spring
in regards to the wishbone. Tomorrow, after the game is over, he
will sit down and evaluate the progress the backs have, or have not
made and finally decide if he will continue it in summer camp.

It seems a- good bet, that unless a real disasters occurs in the
game tomorrow the Wishbone will be around for both the summer
camp and the fall season. If it doesn’t the last twenty practices will
have been for not. Wishbone enthusiasts have nothing to do but keep

on hoping and wishing.

to have an excellent ball club."

In general. Niccols feels that in
comparison to last year’s squad
the players are "playing great
ball for this early in the year.

“It was’a shame we couldn't
play West Virginia when we came
back (the West Virginia game was
rescheduled for later on in the
season due to poor weather con-
ditions),” explained Niccols. “We
were really up for that game, we
were ready to beat them. Even
with the rescheduling, I think we
can beat them.”

/ Niccols believes that the Pan-
thers will do a lot more this sea-
son than just beat WVU.

"Out of the 28 game schedule. it
we get in 20 games l‘ll be happy."
he said; “And out of the 20 I think
we should win 18. barring any in-
juries to the starting players. To
do this. well have to beat the big
name teams like Temple. Buffalo.
Syracuse. and West Virginia."

According to Niccols, Pitt’s
chances ‘for an outstanding sea-
son in ’72 are excellent.

' "Our team has more depth than
we've had in a long time." stated
the hurler. "Talent-wise anyone
on the team can take any one
else‘s place". with‘ the exception
that some players have more ex-
perience than others.

"If everyone plays up to their

potential. this will be one of the
best teams that Pitt has had in a
long while. If we don't, make it to

‘ The win over Indiana for the league title and the
Commissioner’s Cup did justice to the season that
the Pitt skaters had put in. They had gone 10 games
without a loss, being tied once by

one for the icers even though they

_ Outside of a few league games.

BART' MACK tion. Duquesne and C—MU came
. closest to reaching a level of par-
ity with Pitt, but t'or the most part league games
were always lopsided. ’ /
When Pitt did play other schools such as Gan-
non, Penn State, and Kent State, the icers found
themselves on the short end of the score.

The mere showing of the Pitt Hockey Club in
these games should be a tribute to the team..In the

 

- beginning of the year the club was allocated only

$500 by Student Government, just enough to bu_y
new goalie equipment. Also, $2,100 was provided to

Duquesne. The season was a hard .

Skaters shortchanged despite crown,

practice only once a week; at 11 on Thursday nights.

When the Pitt Club took the ice in Erie to play
an exhibition game against Gannon, laughter went
up from the crowd over the tattered uniforms of
the team. Once belonging to the Pittsburgh Pen-

* guins, the jerseys had been ripped and torn several

times. But the guys on the team still skated their
hearts out in a tight, hard hitting contest, showing
thaftheir uniforms did not reflect their ability.

That’s been the story throughout the season.
The University of Pittsburgh, the team in the league
with the most talent, was the team that was least
supported by the University that they represented.

Optimism for next fall was very high during the
season. "We’ll get more money next year,” was the
usual comment of the team. Theclub did get more
funds for the coming season, but the amount is still
far short to what they need and deserve.

Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski was in at-
tendance at the Pitt-Indiana championship game (it
was the first game he had attended) and he was im-
pressed with the turnout. But after the contest his

impressions must have disappeared when he talked ‘
I with player-coach Phil Gefsky. ’

‘Gefsky said that the Hockey Club was allocated
around $1,500 by SG for its operations next fall. ,The

figure is what the team was given this year.but~ does.

For example, C—MU receives over $3,000 for their:?;':.f._,‘

‘The reason why the Pitt Hockey Club is not al-

The truth is, hockey is not ready to becomea

years. But in the meantime, the Pitt Hockey Club

After four frustrating years as a Panther.

which he was recruited. defensive end. His

“It’s a question of need. We’re using the same
(it rise as last year, only the kids are show-
ing a lot more hustle. I’ve got a lot of freedom

John's "freedom to move“ doesn’t come
from the coaches’ generosity but from the
popularity of the wishbone and a need to de-
fuse the problems it presents.

"We‘ve got to beat them (opposing run-
ners) to the ends,“ the senior states. "I usual-

DePasqua snares

~ 3 more gridders

Pitt football coach Carl DePasqua has an-
no need the recruitment of three more stand-
oﬁscholastic football players from Pennsyl-
vania.

Planning to attend Pitt in the fall on foot-
ball grant-in aids are: James Smith, a 6-0.
190-pound linebacker from New Oxford; Den-
nis Moorhead, a 6-2. 195-pound halfback from
Indiana; and John Strom, a 6-252, 240 pound
guard/tackle from Munhall.

Moss finds a home in the end

ing over me. It‘s my job to make the quarter-
back pitch the ball. This year we have real
good containment.“

Regarding a comment by Coach Carl De-
Pasqua that before long Moss could be re-
garded as one of the best defensive ends in
the East, the New York native commented,
“Being new and that I'm at a position I like,
I might make a lot of mistakes by trying too

' hard. But I may also come up with the big play

and that’s what they look for.”

How the best defensive end in New York
State became a halfback is a story in itself.
The whole situation crystalized down in West
Virginia during Moss‘ freshman year.

"Joe Carroll was the number one half-
back," related John. “I was number one de-
fensive end and number two halfback. Joe got
hurt early in the West Virginia game so I
came in at halfback. I had a great game and
I‘ve been at halfback ever since." ‘

Although this is John’s fifth year at Pitt, he
still retains a year of eligibility. This is true
because of a redshirt the 6-4 senior obtained
early this winter, retroactive to his sopho-
more season as a Panther.

During that campaign Moss suffered bron-
chial congestion and never played a game. He
went up to training camp in August and faint-
ed. From then on he didn't even practice with
the team.

Being one of the old veterans doesn't both-
er John a bit. He is cognizant of the youthful
outlook the squad portrays and is glad to be a
part of it.

“Everyone is young,” observed the big
gridder. “They’re not aware of the evils of
Pitt. I won’t say the guys last year didn’t want
to win, but sometimes when they got behind
they didn’t try as. hard. These guys haven’t
had a chance to get in that situation.”

Another thing that Moss sees different
about this year’s gridders is they are all in-
dividuals. They are all concerned about their
particular position and are anxious to do as
well as they can at it.

Friday, April 7,

l...

JOHN MOSS flags down a Dave Havern aerial
while still at the halfback position. Moss, a four
year veteran is now playing at defensive end.

"If you‘re concerned about what you‘re do-
ing.“ commented John, "and you’re doing it
well then it makes the whole unit function bet-
ter. You‘re an individual working within a
unit."

Plagued with numerous minor injuries dur-
ing his four years at Pitt, Moss is out to show
just how tough he is. He’s enthusiastic about
the program and sees success waiting on the
Panthers’ horizon. He’s out to prove that he’s
ready to hit and hit hard.

“When you go at full speed you won’t get
hurt." was his comment.

Backs back

Joe Hendron, according to Jel-
ic is just finding himself.

"We like him because he‘s a
fighter." said Jelic. 0‘

But the real prize of the de-
fensive backfield. however. is
Reggie Frye. Jelic. calls Frye
“myassistantcoach."

"Reggie is the outstanding lead-
er of the backs." proclaimed Jel-
ic. "The backfield looks up to
him. He knows the defense and
has the experience. He's a good
combination of speed and abili-
ty."

Frye, a walkon two years ago,
has recently been named a tri-
captain of the ’72 squad. He re-
members when Bryant Salter used
to take him aside and help him
understand his position. Now,
Frye is the one taking novices
to the side, thus the assistant
coach label. ’

“I think experience means a
lot." said Frye. "We should be
twice as good as last year. We

know each other. we have a to- .

gether mind. and I think we can
stop making so many mental er-
rorsf'

Jim Parros. who spent last
year as a decoy flanker. has been
moved to the defensive corps.
Parros at 6-2. 190 pounds. adds
both speed and mass to the ‘skin-
ny’ group

“He’s a fine athlete,” said Jel-
ic of Parros, “I think he can help
our program back there.” Speedy
Bruce Murphy is also going to
receive some work in the back-
field slots.

If experience means anything.
mental errors should be limited
in the defensive backfield next
fall. and hopefully hearts should
beat a little slower for football
enthusiasts.

Smith, an outstanding lineback-
Ker from Delone Catholic High
"Sc%’ool, captained the team this
past season, was named to the
prestigious Big 33 team, and
chosen first team All-Harrisburg.
He also won four letters in wrest-

the last two years.

Moorhead starred at Indiana
Area High School as both an of-
fensive and defensive halfback.

 intercepted seven passes as a
sophomore and last season threw
for four touchdowns. He was
named honorable mention All-
State and listed as one of the
“Top 100 Backs in Pennsylvania.”

Strom, a big lineman from
Steel Valley High School. has the
_size to play either guard or tackle.
An honor roll student, he was
named to the Steel Valley All-
Star team and in addition to cap-
taining the football squad this past
season, won letters in basketball,
baseball, and volleyball. Strom
plans to major in physical educa-
tion while at Pitt.

”&nsidering that this was their
first group match and the teams
they played against were of inter-
national calixer, Pitt’s volleyball
M club gave a surprising perform-
ance last week at the Community
House Tournament.

Lead by player—coach and or-
ganizer Alan Freilander. the club
competed in six matches. scoring
60 points to their oppositions
total of 75 points.

Being the only college club par-

fticipating against nationally
known YMCA teams, tournament

‘, officials were stunned by Pitt’s

1972-73 season for both high

For the first six common fouls

After the sixth foul in the half.

, According to Pitt Coach Buzz

Ridl. who favors ‘the new rule
adoption, there were’ several rea-
sons for its implementation. \

"It will speed up the game." he
observed. "It will cut down on a
possible 245 trips to the foul line
during the game.“

Ridl also explained how this
may alter early game strategies.
“Until now, it was an advantage
to foul the other team to give
them one shot —-statistically, it
has been shown that a free throw
is worth .7 of a point over a long
period oftime,” he said. ‘

Paulists were
' founded in 1858
by Isaac Hecker, they were the
first religious Community of
priests established in North
America by an American and
for Americans. ' ‘

Father Hecker, who was a cen-
-- .tury ahead of his time, wanted
Paulists to be free of compul-
sory activities so they could be
ﬂexible enough to meet the
needs of the Church in every age

Today’s Paulist‘ can be as in-
volved as he wants to be. He is
given the freedom to Lise his own
talents to do his own thing. He
may be a parish priest, an edu-
cator or a press, radio or televi-
sion personality.

Father Hecker discovered the
value of communications early,
With his monthly publications
and pamphlets, he laid the
foundation for the Paulist/New-
man Press, the country’s largest
publisher and distributor of
Catholic literature.

Today, Father Hecker's vision
and foresight have fled to the es-
tablishmentof Paulist radio, tele-
vision and film centers on a scale
that perhaps, noteven he dreamed
of

But then, he ‘had the vision.
He showed us the way.

 changed for fall  

a common foul. Ridl said that.
"statistically. a good shooting
team will benefit. "

Though not expected to be a
great problem. Ridl admits that
"conditioning will enter into it a
bit more without the stopping of

‘play for those one foul shot at-

tempts.“

Other major rule changes are
presently under consideration by
the NCAA’ and Ridl related that
they have been receiving large
measure of acceptance among the
coachesat the national champion-
ships in Los Angeles two weeks
ago. ’ —

Elevating the basket to 11 feet
instead of the present 10 feet level
and installing a 30 second time
limit for possession are the chief
proposals.

Ridl cited an experimental
game this winter in Los Angelas
to disprove arguments against
raising the hoop a foot. "The play-
ers shot just about the same after
a week of practice. The good
shooters can adjust to it.

“It’s still several years away,”
he continued, “but an 11 foot bask-
et would eliminate congestion and
crowding around the basket on re-
bounds. Also, it would almost eli-

minate the controversy about 1
many of the present goaltending

calls.”

Finally. Ridl discussed a prob-
lem with the 10 foot basket that
not many Pitt players have en-
countered recently. though others

» around the country «have.

"Many players have been in-
jured by hitting their heads and
arms on the rim—an 11 foot bask-
et would be an added sat'ety fac-
tor."
