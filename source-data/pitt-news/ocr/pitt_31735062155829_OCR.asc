To Woo Pitt

By DAVE GREEN
Members of Student Con-
gress met last Saturday with
representatives of the Nation-
al Student Association regard-

joining -the group, A and ‘the .
solons seemed more willing to lis-
ten than last year.

Last February, SC voted down
a proposal to join, NSA after both.
Men”s Council and Women’s Self-
Government Association refused
to affiliate. The negative vote last
year, while officially based upon
cost of membership in the group,
followed a haranguee by certain
councilmen about. alleged NSA
Communist leanings.

At an open hearing at that time,
representatives of _NSA’s region-
al organizationwere battered with
“pinko” charges by Joe Shuler,
Bus. Ad. ’55, then an MC mem-
ber. ‘

At Saturday’s meeting how-
ever, Jim Edwards, national
N SA regional chairman, pointed
out that NSA has been‘ cleared
of any Red charges, most of
which were pressed by the Stu-
dents For America, a group that
has been branded Fascist ~«by
certain schools.

Edwards cited statements by
Dwight D. Eisenhower, President
of the United States, John Foster
Dulles, secretary of state, and
Mutual Security Administrator

the NSA for its work among
American students. ’ 1 '

Signiﬁcant in ’ the _ case present-
ed for NSA’s comingto Pitt was
theﬂfact that costs ‘for Pitt’s »join— _
ing wouldbe, far less- than origin-
ally estimated. , '

SC was told last year that 1
Pitt would be charged entrance‘.
and dues fees on the basis of
over 10,000 students enrolhnent.
This was expected to cost stu-”
dent governing bodies nearly -
$1000 per year.

The legislators heard Saturday,
however, that Skyscraper U.
would be charged on thebasis of
its daytime undergraduate enroll-
ment, less than 6,000. Edwards es-
timated that dues andreigular fees
would amount to about $200 per
year plus convention expenses,
the extent of-» which -could be set
by Pitt governing bodies.

Asked what services Pitt
would receive through NSA
membership Edwards pointed
out that the group may be forced
to eliminate travel tours and ad-
visory services offered now to
non-member schools. He‘ also
noted intangible beneﬁts such as
conferences and conventions. "

By .mv ROTHMAN
Student Congress has, re-
vived interest in joining the
National Student Association.
Jane Pickering, SC corres-
ponding secretary, repeated
on a meeting held last Satur- 0

day afternoon with leading-mem-
bers of NSA.

~ At that time, Jim Edwards, Na-
tional NSA president and Bob
Krill, the Western Pennsylvania
chairman, addressed members of
SC, Men’s Council and Women’s
Self Government Association.

They spoke of the advantages
that NSA had to offer the Univer-
sity: training presidents to more
successfully do their jobs; distrib-
uting student information and re- »
search data; public relations; and
a student exchange program for
overseas travel. ‘ -
Pinpointed to the issue of
finances which caused Pitt’s re-
fusal to join a year ago, the rep-
resentatives listed these ex-
penses: $125 for National dues;
$50, conference fees; and $175
National convention fees. The
amount was not so prohibitive
as that submitted the ﬁrst time.

Last year’s controversy resulted”
from charges of high ﬁnances and
“pink tinge” connected with the
NSA._ The NSA representatives at-
tempted to disprove both charges
at the Saturday meeting. ‘

It is a ~known fact that Pitt’s
membership in the “Voice of
American student “governments”
would greatly increase its prestige
and development. ' '

However, Emil Herman, sopho-
more representative, questioned
the means by which the revenue
could be obtained. He voiced cau-
tion, saying, “Congress would hav
to raise its budget.” j

Ross Reese, SC_prexy, has re- .
ferred the NSA problem to the
executive committee for more
intensive study. It will no doubt
come up at the next SC meeting,
Thursday evening, Feb. 25.

At Monday’s SC meeting, the so-
lons also received a very optimistic

» report concerning the parking sit-

uation. Chairman Stan Greenﬁeld

tee had spoken to Mr. Michael Git-
tens, head of the City Bureau, of
Traffic Planning. He said that‘-
plans were underway for re-a1ign-
ingv parking stalls in Schenley
Plaza. The purpose would‘ be
mainly to prevent baseball crowds
from hedging in the cars of Pitt
students. . . .,

Greenﬁeld told congressmen that
within the next week, Mr. Gittens
and a survey party would be look-
ing over the Oakland district for
possible new parking places.

’ At the same meeting, SC cast
ballots for its third public rela-
tions chairman this year. Emil
Herman was elected to the po-
sition which no person has been
able to keep for more than three
months. Bill McKenna submit-
ted his resignati Feb. 9. He
had succeeded Joe Trattner in
November.

Herman expressed a concern to
“establish closer relations with
the student body,wand to make the.
average student conscious of the
large part he can play. in student
government activities.”

engineers. .

The theme of the entire week
has been built around Saint Pat-
rick and Shamrocks. The engineers
have theorized that St. Pat was
the ﬁrst engineer since he drove
the‘snakes out of Ireland. This is
supposed to have represented the
ﬁrst “worm-drive” or worm-gear.
Also, a manuscript has supposed-
ly been found with the words
“Erin Go Brae” inscribed in St.
Patrick’s hand. According to the
engineers, this ‘can be liberally
translated to read “St.” Patrick
was an engineer.”

Bob Dickinson is chairman of.

Worthwhile things can be planned and achieved by capable
groups working together in ﬁelds of scholastic endeavor

often neglected. _ ~ -'

Tomorrow, as their ﬁrst united project, this coordinat-
ing group is sponsoring thegchapel service, with Sam Seigle,
CSO member, as student leader. With bigger plans in mind,

CSO also hopes to have charge of Scholars’ Day this year ,

which, incidentally, would be the best thing to happen. to

/ Scholars’ Day in many years. = ,
With the support of eligible scholastic honoraries on

campus, CSO can become one of the most worthwhile groups

ever organized at Pitt.

T alre tlie Advantage

A long-desired activity at Pitt may go into disuse be-
fore it comes of age if students refuse to show the interest
they first expressed in the project. The all student or-
chestra still meets every Wednesday at 3:30 p.m. in 817 C1
andrehearses till 5 p.m. They are still in need of a few mem-
bers and the University willfurnish most ‘bf the instruments-
required for an orchestra. Members who are interested as
well as those who have not yet signed up for the activity
are urged to attend the rehearsal this afternoon, even if

they have not brought their own instrument or attended

any other sessions. The privilege pf this organization is

open to all students, including freshmen women, but it is A

a privilege and we hope that the interested persons will
show the necessary interest. ‘ ..

Third of a Series

  

 

Cha||engeAccepted  

By Harriet Pincus
I am young. I am a college senior. I am con-
fronting an everchanging world. The prospect is

‘frightening, challenging; and at once inﬁnitely com-

forting. _

’ We as students today are being called upon to
prove‘ that the world is yet round. We stand to-
gether at the brink of a great unknown. If we
take our next steps bravely,:_yet;

implanted in the good hard soil
of human wisdom and ideals, we
are one with Columbus- in his
great discovery that there is no

we live. If we are clumsyand
careless, and hurtlei‘ from the
heights of our knowledge into in
oblivion,’ the earth‘ is sq.uare——

- very square indeed!

There will be much to frighten us as we take
those next great steps together. Men will continue
to_ hate, maim, and kill. Governgients will rise to
great heights of power in one moment, only to be
shattered’ in the next. Some of our own friends
will drop behind us, thwarted by others or de-
stroyed by their own' all-consuming‘ desires" for
money, power, all the frostings on-the cake of ‘life.

« Fear. Anger. ‘Tears

We have already been frightened.‘ iWe shud-
dered as that first atom bomb- fell on Hiroshima;

we howled in loud protest at th:e recall‘ of Mac- ,
Arthur; we brooded as our brothers marched oﬂf to ”

F Man-‘s Limitations Not Yet, Reached.

 

die in the “police action” that was Korea; we wept
for thetwenty-o_ne, lost to America and themselves
in the debauchery and hell of Communism.

Yet most of us have done more than‘ scream

and cry. We have accepted the challenge of our
changing world which ‘peeks out at us from its
test—tube prison in Alumni Hall, washes over us

in political science and economics clesses, and

shrieks from an education classroom on the 37th
floor of the Cathedral of Learning. Our motley
army, uniformed in Pitt blazers and armed with
textbooks, has knocked the glove from the great
shoulder and proved itself ready.

Life Work Inherited

ﬁnd herein, lies our comfort. This is our great‘

task, the lifework of our generation. Our parents
havetried and perhaps, on occasions, failed; their
faith in‘. us remains to be fulﬁlled. We owe the
generations ye_t"to come a debt of- honor and of
life ,and this too rests on what we do today. We
are youngvand strong. Today’s fclhangesare of us
and for us, for they are our life.

The great Hebrew scholar, Eliezer ben Yehuda,
adopted ‘as his life’s motto this simple statement:
“The time is so short, the task to be ‘done so
great.” Letius take it for our own. i

. I am young. I am a senior in college. I am al-
ready well on my way on the great journey into
the ever-changing world. My travelling companions
are yesterday’s ‘wisdom and today’s strength, which
together will help the face up to whatever the
future may bring.

How High, How Far 

By Jim Deweese ,
What is‘ the practical limit to m§n’s explora-
ticms? The question has been raised many. times

«and has received many answers. Some say that

n

‘refuted as hoaxes buttoday they ~  
stand as facts. Man can not go too much deeper.
‘into the depths of the seas,but' each foot is im-

man has already reached the limit of his explora-
tions. Some sayyno. Some scoff. Butstill there
is the question. I V

3 Last Monday two French Naval officers set a
new deep sea diving record when
they descended to a depth of
13,163 feet. Several months ago
a Navy research plane ﬂew to a
height of 83',000 feet. Unmanned
rockets have attained heights of
several hundred miles. M

Explorations Become‘ Harden

As little as ten years ago,
these records would have been

    

measurably harder. In making the record decent,
the Frenchmen’s craft underwent ,pressures of
50,000 TONS. ' c

And it may be even mi/ore difﬁcult to send man
higher into the air. If the pressure sealed cabins
of the aircraft should fail, the human body would

Doi1't_Want Rickshaw. Romance, . .,

burst like a balloon since the pressure is almost)
zero in the near vacuum of the outer atmosphere.
Dangers Infinitely Greater .
VTeimperatures reach extremes in these upper
regions and would, if a man’ were exposed to them,
cause his blood to boil. This is in stark contrast
to, the depths of the oceans where a; man would

’ be crushed’ and compressed until his body could _

be placed in a shoe box.

,These explorations into/the unknown are dan-
gerous, to be sure. But after all, you can only die
once. You .might say that this is no job for a
grandfather. But both the pilot of the record set-
ting aircraft and the reknown Auguste Piccard,
who held the previous record of underwater de-
cent, are old enough’ to be grandfathers.

Answer Cannot Be Given

And still there remains the question of how far
man is capable“ of carrying his explorations of the
unknown. The answer has yet to be given for no
testhas ever successfully proven man‘ incapable of
achieving his goals.

A well known rocket expert has predicted that,
if "F ample funds can be raised, man CAN reach
the moon within 15 years. The ‘majority of people
still scoff, but an increasing number view this pre-

diction with respect for they believe that there is

no ‘limit.

I think that Mrs. James T. Liu’-,

instructors in the Far Eastern de-

partment, had an excellent idea

when they inaugurated this study

of the Chinese language to create
a more avid interest in the Far
East. « .

do government work in that area.

According to the preface in the
text used, written by SSu‘-uu—
Teng, “the completely up-to-date
text provides the indispensable

core of Chinese that the business- '

-m‘an, technical ‘ expert, teacher,

newspaperman, diplomat, or rhis-—‘

are actually planning to go to
that Far Eastern country. The
rest will probably be content to
amble into Wen Fou Yung’s laun-
dry on Fifth Avenue’ and ask in
Peiking dialect to have the fam-
ily’s .white ‘shirts washed and
starched.‘ '

i ‘ And-it will be able to satisfy

my old yearning to try unusual
Qriental dishes. No more of the
conventional rice for me. In a
few weeks I shall be skillfully
ordering yen or myan, in any
authentic Chinese restaurant.
Chinese Customs Learned

The more diligent students will
know enough to answer in the
affirmative‘. if a white-coated
waiter inquires, “Ni waw shwey
he ma?” Otherwise he would be
missing out on a glass of good
after-dinner sherry.

Some curious aspects of the

Chinese ‘customs are unfolded,
too. The a.uthor'of the text hopes,

that the students will ﬁnd it a

‘valuable key to one of the world’s

oldest living cultures. (I' have
already found it so.)' .

The Chinese'.Room provides a
realistic setting for this Far

 Eastern subject. The "thick’ oak

lioned windows exclude the rest-
lessness of the Western world,

creating pensiveness within. One '

feels compelled to do his best in
this environment.

I The twisted. dragon, protector
of the pearl of wisdom, leers at
the class from the ceiling. Con-
fuscius’ unwavering gaze and the
symbols of intelligence set in the
rococo~ style beamsiare constant
reminders of scholarship.

Why Chinese? '

But, ‘although I find this course
very worthwhile and quite en-

‘joyable, I still ﬁnd myself com-

pletely baﬂied when someone
spies the blaring letters, on my
book cover with credulous eyes
and sputters curiously, “Why in
the world are you taking Chi-
nese-‘?” v

No practical reason. This is my

‘fourth foreign language, I have

ﬁlled the requirements in this
ﬁeld at Pitt, and it certainly isn’t
helping me to graduate from the
School of Education. It is s-till
my favorite class.

one taking this new course in ,

BOB LAZOR
Height Plus Might
as: :-

Needs :StretcIi

By GENE AROMATORIO

Big Bob “Stretch” Lazor, 6-6 center, may be the answer
next year to Head Coach Bob Timmon’s prayers. Two of the
things that Timmons could use are just what Lazor’ can

provide-—added height and scoring¢

.. -Lu‘. I
.

Although .Stretch didn’t become
interested in the hardwood sport
until he was a- gangling kid of 14,

V his art start didn’t hamper Bob in

his development,
proves.

While starring for his hometown

as his record

Canonsburg ﬁve Bob was chosen

on the All-Section team and was
also the highest scorer in Wash-
ington County in his senior year.
Good Opportunity

The modest bus ad major at-
tributes his success to his high
school coach, Ollie Orsino. Bob
says, “If it were not for. him I
wouldn’t be here at Pitt—he sure
brought me a long way in four
years.”

Bob chose Pitt mainly for schol-

- arship and because “there's a good

opportunity for me here.”

Lazor, with the reach of an octo-
pus, is a constant thorn in the side

' of opposing players under the bas-
‘ ket.

Hook Shot Best

His ability to get up in the air
brings a gleam to the eye of
Freshman Coach Carl Peterson,
who says, “Bob’s really learning
to get off the floor for those re-
bounds.”

Stretch has a variety of shots,
but considers his hook shot as the
best. When moving around in the
pivot Bob poses a real threat to
opposing teams with his deadly
hook and quick jump shots.

As Coach Peterson remarked,
,“Bob has a fine scoring touch and
he's improving it every day. He’s
moving faster and that’s helping
him in the pivot.

Looking irfto the future, Lazor
predicts, “We have a good team

now and should be a darn good
team in a couple of years.”

Lazor doesn’t plan on laying off
after the basketball season has
ended. A pitcher in high school,
thegbig 220-pounder plans to try
to grab off a berth on baseball
coach Ralph Mitterling’s mound
corps this spring.

Riflers Lose First
At Mountie Range

West .Virginia’s sharpshooters
pinned the ﬁrst loss on the Pitt
riﬂe team’s slate last, Saturday
when they sqineaked through to a
close 14101-1397 decision.

Sgt. Bob Davidson, coach of the
Panthers, attributed the loss to
the unfamiliarity of the Mountie
range and said, ‘‘We’ll have a
much better chance when they
visit us here.” -

Previously, the Panther shoot-
ers beat Carnegie Tech and Du-
quesne. -

Veteran Tom Shepard ledthe
team at Morgantown with a score
of 284 out of a possible 300. Oth-
er scores were Dave Jacobson with
283, Bob Stanger with 278, Bill
Kelley with 278, and Jim Cleary
with 274.

Mastery over Mounties

By RUSS FRANKE

West Virginia fans were probably rubbing their eyes
in disbelief this morning after the most recent proof that
athletic relations with Pitt are undergoing complete reversal.
Until lately the Mountaineers dominated the locals on
the court and suffered compensation on the gridiron, but
last night’s 83-64 trouncing. at the Field House found the
Panthers rising to a new high in basketball mastery, while
atoning somewhat for the last two¢ ‘

football defeats. ‘ _ -
The victory marked the ﬁrst
time in ten years that Pitt has
beaten their arch rivals twice_in a

cent of their shots for the evening,
the resurging Panthers led by as
much as 21 points while complete-

se Mounties‘

rave notices said he was. In the
process of racking up 48 points in
his team’s 106-85 victory over the
Pitt frosh, the 6-4 ball hawk en-
tertained the crowd with a remark-
able exhibition of ﬂoor wizardry
and sleight-of-hand, all accom-
panied by an air of good-humored
cockiness.

The loss proved more serious to
the Panther Cubs, however, as the
result of a severe leg injury to
guard John Laneve, who may be
[out for the season with a cracked
bone.

Merely Losing
Isn't Enough

By RUSS FRANKE

_ Sports Editor 7 ‘ "

One’ of our ‘reporters handed in to the sports desk a
Pittsburgh newspaper this week containing a somewhat dis-

turbing article. The story itself¢ /

was not disturbing, since it mere-

ly reported the departure from the
Pitt basketball team of a player

' who could not quite make the

grade as a regular, but the treat-
ment of this rather ordinary in-

cident went a bit too far in the_

matter of taste.

The story, which appeared in
last Saturday’s Courier, would
have served its purpose as a news
item after reporting that sopho-
more Ernie Bryant left for his
home in Coatesville to help out his
family until- his father recovers
from illness. Ernie, who has «a
good‘ standing scholastically, plans
to return next fall.

But the writer of the article
seized this opportunity to pounce
upon the Pitt‘team as a listless,
cellar-dwelling ‘ball club which
is continuing on the down grade.
The article also quotes Bryant
as saying that Coach Bob Tim-
mons overlooked him in practice
and passed him by when look-
ing over the bench for subs.

Now, any one who saw the Pitt
team that outhustled and soundly,
whipped Penn State las_t Satur-
‘day certainly could not call the
Panthers a skidding outﬁt. Rath-
er, the locals, while still unpre-
dictable, show signs of jelling in-

to a pretty sharp bunch. Fresh-
man prospects look promising, and
Timmons needs only a little time
to convert the team he inherited
into a modern-type machine.

Meanwhile, Timmons would
hardly overlook any player, for
any reason whatever, if he thought
that player would help in forming
a winning combination. A coach’s
record is his livelihood.

The intent of the articles be-
came clear, even if the reason-
ing didn’t, near the end when
it ran:

‘.‘Where ‘do the Panthers go from
here? That’s anybody’s guess.
Certainly Bryant isn’t worried.
And we’re quite certain that Du-
quesne with its talented ball club
isn't losing any sleep over the fact
either.”

Without giving the matter more

..attention than it deserves, sufﬁce

it to say that the success of~a win-
ning athletic team does not hinge
upon the race classiﬁcation of its
members, but upon the caliber of
the athletes themselves.

There is no doubt here that
Pitt fans welcome with open
arms any ball player who is
able to help win a football or
basketball game.

Matmen Cop Seventh;

Peery Captures’ 38th .

. By PAUL HARRISON «
Judging by the 25-5 shellacking they handed Lock Haven
last Saturday, the Panther grapplers apparently intend to
keep -- winning despite their numerous injuries.

In their next Field House match?

Coach Rex Peery’s grapplers will
go after win number eight against
them thﬁre Mountaineers from
West Virginia on Saturday in the

same fashion.

Against Lock Haven dependable
Hugh Peeryekept his personal rec-
ord intact as he decisioned Char-
ley Goldberg for his 38th consecu-
tive collegiate win. 4 Bill Kozy,
subbing for injured Ronnie Kurt_z,
then displayed his grappling abili-
ty in the 130-pound class to give
the Panthers a six-nothing lead.

George Matthews, 137, Charley
Uram, 157, and Ed DeWitt, 167,
enjoyed equal success in piling up
more Pitt points.

‘Swimmers Set

Miami Marks

With four straight wins now
under their belts, the latest an
easy 58-26 conquest of Miami of
Ohio, the Panther swimmers are
prepping for their final road trip
of the campaign-—A.rmy.

Last year the Cadets and the
Panthers ended in a 42-42 tie and
the previous season the West
Pointers beat Pitt.

In last Saturday’s meet at Ox-
ford, 0., Pitt also notched two new
Ronnie Gainsford
reset the books as he swam the
200—yard breast stroke in 2:27.3
and Freddie O’Nions made the
other standard in the 150-yard in-
dividual medley with a 1231.3.

Besides these two, the Blue and
Gold also grabbed six other first
places. -

Both relay teams won as Skippy
Joe Depelheuer, and
O’Nions took the 300-yard medley
and Henry Zentgraf, Roy Kaupe,
O’Nions, and Harry Piwowarski
formed the 400-yard free style
team. o

Jim Zurcher swam away with
two individual wins- copping the
220 and 440 free styles. Monsein
and O’Nions also triumphed in
their specialties, the 200—yard,back
stroke and the 150-yard individual
medley, respectively. ,

Coach Ben Grady is doubtful,
though, that his team can come
through as well this weekend.
“We’re a little short in seconds
and thirds,” says the swim tutor,
“so we’ll be‘ hard pressed to win.”

A certain Sophomore named Brown acquired the
appellation “F1ash," not because he was lightning on the
gridiron, but just because he was never without an answer.

You’d pass him on the quadrangle and say “How's it goin',
Flash?” He’d answer, "Air Express.” Get the pitch?)

Brown often referred to his “two-headed brother" in
conversations. One day a few men in his fraternity were

needling him.

“Your brothcris two heads must present quite a few problems.”

“Not really. The only problem was his neatness," said Flash.

"Neatness?" “Yes,” answered Flash, “he worried about it.
Said he couldn’t ﬁnd a shirt that didn't wrinkle around the
collar. You see, he was often looking in two directions

-at once, or eating and talking on the telephone.

‘ Hard on a collar.”

“What did you do?” They knew he did something about it.

"Simple. I got him the Van Heusen Century shirt with the
exclusive soft collar that won't wrinkle ever! I got him
different collar styles and colors. $3.95 for the white,

$4.95 for the colors and superﬁne whites. You should have
seen the grins on his faces when he saw how those collars .
stayed neat all day and night without starch or stays."

“I guess he can really hold his heads up now,”‘said one.

"Yep. He ﬁgures he gets four times more wear from Century
than from other shirts. Of course, he actually only'gets twice
the wear. He just ﬁgures in both heads.”

. . . ‘ In
One of the men visited Brown at Christmas, and found

it was all true.

T OR more than thirty years. we have used
research day in and day out learning about
tobaccos and cigarettes in the public’s interest.

Continuously we and our consultants have
analyzed, experimented with and smoked all
“ kinds of tobaccos . . .cspccially Southern Bright,
Burley, Maryland and Turkish cigarette to-

baccos.

Our own cigarettes and competitive brands
have been submitted to the most exacting
scientiﬁc scrutiny including thousands of anal-
yses of millions of pounds of tobaccos._

From all these thousands of analyses, and
other ﬁndings reported in the leading technical
journals, our Research Department has found
no reason to believe _that_ the isolation and
elimination of any element native to cigarette
tobaccos’ today would improve smoking. i
