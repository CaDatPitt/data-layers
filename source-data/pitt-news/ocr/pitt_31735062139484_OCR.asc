Voters To Sign Twice

By Igor

“\Vitl1 thy shiny pin and glit-
tering eye, now wherefore stopst
thou me?”

“Brother, can you spare a reg-
istration card? And please tell the
pledges to dig up a ﬂock of them
——sp1-iiig elections are on the way,
tra, la.”

An ancient scene, a common scene,
the above. Back in the years of yore
it was as much a ritual of campus
life as the reading of an honorary/’s
induction ceremonies.

But cock robin dead——shot
through the heart by the Student
Faculty Association, with J. G. Quick’s
registration off-ice cooperating.

‘With a hey nonny—nonny, and no
hot cha’s, the office of the registrar
announces today that spring elections
next semester will be clean.

No more will the birds of spring-
time twitter down on scenes of card
swapping and other schemes to out-
wit the election officials.

“Why it was easily possible to se-
cure two or three registration cards
and vote as many times for your fa-
vorite candidate,” said a prominent
student politician.

is

“Or twenty cards and twenty
times,” added another.
Enough. The plan in brief is this:

Mr. Quick’s staff will henceforth slow
up the registration process for a split
second on each student to allow time
for the ﬁlling out of a special spring
election card bearing the signature of
the student. '

At election time, when the student
requests a ballot blank, he will again
be asked to sign his name, and the
signatures will be compared. Regis-
tration cards will be unnecessary
when one steps up to vote at the

polls.

The plan was ﬁrst devised by the

Executive co'ii'i'ii'i't'f.e‘é" ‘audits a.spects

have been worked out over the last
week. But it is only through its sup-
port by Registrar Quick that the sys-
tem will be feasible.‘

Cap, Gown Still
Lacks Director

Committee Considering Eight
Applicants For Position

 

Cap and Gown is literally tripping
over the footlights—st.ill lacking a
director for the spring show. A spe-
cial committee formed from the Exec-
utive committee of the Cap and Gown
Graduate club gave its report on eight
possible directors for the show at a
meeting in the Hotel Sclienley Thurs-
day evening. The choice of a direc-
tor, however, was delayed until the
committee investigated further.

Theodore W. Biddle, assistant dean
of men and member of the Graduate
club, made the following statement
regarding the attitude of the Gradu-
ate club: ,

“The Graduate club will delay the
choice until February 1, if necessary.
W'e have several persons under con-
sideration, but feel that further infor-
mation concerning these persons and
other possible applicants is forthcom-
ing The Cap and Gown Graduate
club refuses to jeopardize this year’s
show by hastening into a contract.”

The production committee of the
Graduate club made a hasty review
of the three manuscripts which have
been submitted by students for Cap
and Gown. A special committee of
three members was delegated to maki-
an intensive review of the books and
have its report ready by Monday eve-
ning when the club will meet at the
Hotel Schenley.

Mr. Biddle will interview the stu-
dent scenario writers Tuesday and
Wednesday in his office, Room 801
Cathedral.

Congressional Library Asks
For Fraternity Handbook

   

For the ﬁrst time in the history of
the University, a fraternity handbook
has been placed in the Library of

A letter was received by the dean

1934-35 Fraternity Hand-book, edited
by Jules L-.. Green, C35, and Morris V.
Rosenbloom, C36.

A copy was immediately dispatched
to Vvashiiigtoii, where it now rests
among the tomes of American political
sages. ‘

The night for a “s1iowdown” had arrived.

lighted up with bonﬁres.

Crowds milled through the streets.

Evil-facet-d
A tenseness hung over the cilty

l
Thus did Leonard J. Croniie, traveling secretary for Intercollegiate Coim-
cil, describe to a Pitt News representative the setting preceding the bloody
February riots which startled the world with 200 and more deaths. .‘
’Mr. Cromic spoke here at a student meeting last week. He continued:

"‘W'e all knew there would be trou-‘é

ble. The papers had advertised the
things for weeks. The Stavisky scan-
dal had just broken and France was
aﬂaine over the appointment of Mon-
sieur Douniergue as prime minister.

“I left the Ecole. de Politique Sci-
ence building expecting to have a
good time. I saw as much as any-
one -but I didii’t have a good time.

“Two lines were approaching the
administration building across the
Seine in Paris. Although acting in-
dependently, botli the royalists and
communists had the same purpose in
mind. Raise hell.

“I thought if I walked slowly down
the street, I wouldn’t be bothered by
the police who already were gather-
ing. Suddenly mounted troops swept
down the wide plaza before the build-
ing. Remarks and stones had been
thrown to insult the bravery of the
French police. Cries ﬁlled the air as
the police smashed right and left with
their niaces.

“Here and there one was torn off
his horse, beaten with his own mace,
ﬁnally rescued as more bones were

broken.

“So far no shot had been ﬁred. 1 I
kept walking.

“Directly in front of me a Storekeep-
er was standing in the doorway. He
took no part in the proceedings, but
just watched. A policeman dashed
up to him, ripped off the iiian’s cap
and beat him until the man fell un-
conscious.

“I pulled my passport out of my
pocket, and and held it above my head
as I walked on. ‘Finally I stopped be-
hind a marble statute to view the
scene. Everyone was singing. ‘Down
with the Republic, long live the king;
if we catch Doumergue, we'll smash
his face in.’

“Directly in front of me stood a
peasant, singing as loudly as the rest.
‘Without warning the machine guns
broke out. Both of us thought the
shots were being ﬁred into the air.
‘We didn’t move. ' I

“Suddenly the man staggered, th n
sank to the pavement, gripping a
broken hand covered with blood.

“I waited no longer.”

New Pitt Review
To Begin Work
On Second Issue

Their ﬁrst issue already distributed
among ROTC classes Friday, the ed-
itors of the new Pitt R0-TC Review
begin work today on their second
issue, which will be out in two weeks.

Over 400 copies of the eight-page
minieographed paper were published,
according to Everett Pickering, C35,
editor-in-cl1ief_ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ C  

Changing from the standard style of"

typing headlines, the staff of the Re-
view used hand-drawn headlines to

accentuate their twenty-eight articles,

editorials and columns. .-

A featured article by Lieutenant-
Colonel Edward J. Cullen, director of
military science and tactics, was dis-
played on the ﬁrst page. Colonel
Cullen stressed loyalty as part of the
cadet corps code. '

Cadet Captain Howard 0. Husband,
C35, outlined the necessary require-
ments of a reserve officer, pointing
out the need for advancement to raise
the standard of the corps_

In a personal column, Frances Mc-
Laughlin, honorary ﬁrst captain, de-
clared: V
military uniform, a good band, march-
ing feet, a crisp salute, a parade that
thrills girls to the quick. To receive
recognition from the University mil-
itary department is, I believe, the big-
gest honor any Pitt coed could dream
of.”

An editorial promised to “cut down
on the quantity of errors and also the
quality” in the forthcoming issue. It
extended the hope that contributions
niight enable the Review to be printed
rather than ininieograplied.

“Everlasting glory” was promised
the winner of the cadet contest now

in full swing for the best motto most-

conipetently expressing the “correct
thought, the will and the spirit of the
cadet regiment.” The motto and au-
thor will probably be announced in
the next issue of the Review.

Santa Claus was» the cause of nine

ofﬁcers of the group. The ﬁrst pres-
ents were withoutconimeiit to A. J‘.
Hornfeck and C. N. Harnish, chair-
man and vice chairman of the group.
Each of them received a glove from
the same pair.

The meaning of these gifts did not

become apparent until Howard E.‘

Dyc-he, head of the electrical engi-
neer1ng_depa.rtme-nt, was called ‘upon
to receive his gift. Santa then be-
gan a lecture on how hard it was to
be constantly shaking hands and
suited the deed to the phrase by pre-
senting Mr. Dyclie a pair of extra-
flne resistant gloves.

that lie_would not be subject to im-
proper inﬂuence from students.” J.
A._ Wasniund, instructor, got an elec-
tric motor “to remind him that lie
was still an electrical engineer in
spite of his work in the CE depart-
ment.” Chester Duck, secretary, re-
C<_31‘{ed a rat trap “to alleviate his rat

Faculty Swap
Talks At First
Bus-Ad Buzzer

“I like the Business Administration
students better than any others in the
University,” said Montfort Jones, pro-
fessor ot‘ ﬁnance and acting dean of
the School of Business Administra-
tion. And even the Pitt News re-
porter, a College man, applauded.

It? was that kind of a meeting in
Room 1309, Cathedral, last week. The
affair" was the “Bus-Ad --Buzzer,” the
ﬁrst “get acquainted” snicker spon-
sored by flie Pitt Business Institute to
promote contacts between facultyand
students in the School of Business
Administration.

In presenting a thumb-nail biog-
raphy of several members of the
faculty, Mr. Jones referred to Dr.

leorge K McCabe, ass,is’tant profes-l

sor of economics. as “that great Nor-
wegian wit.” and to Dr. John M. For-
guson. professor of economics, as

“the Don Juan of the Bus-Ad depart-:

ful to begin his talk with the familiar

City Assessors

Debate Stadium
Tax 0:‘ $4§,0U0

As the City tax assessment board
receives more int‘orm.=ition from the
University today, matters deﬁnitely
approach a climax with ﬁnal decision
on the proposed $46,000 St'.1.dium tax
expected Thursday,

This was indicated by Percy R.
Williaiiis, city assessor, who told The
Pitt News Friday the decision “prob-
ably” would be made by 'l.‘liursda.y.

At that time the University will
learn whether or not the city will
levy tax on the stadium, claiming it
is a corporation and unnecessary.

The couiity—investigatiiig independ-
ently of the city assessment board-
announced Friday it too expected to
make ﬁnal decision “near the end of
the week.” If the board of assess-
ment and revision of taxes decides on
a tax, the University will have more
than $13,000 added to its Stadium up-
keep, making the total proposed tax
nearly $60,000.

Last Thursday the county board
visited the Stadium to inspect the
building and grounds. Upon request
for more iiiforniatioii, John VVGDC‘.-1‘,
business manager of the University,
furnishedthe board with further de-
tails concerning construction and size
of the Stadium.

The county tax board Friday as-
serted it may take iii_ore time. to de-
cide, since a tax on the Stadium
would not be effective until_,next May
1. A city tax would become effective
January 1.

This was taken as mcaiiing both
boards could have more time in case
the University took an unfavorable de-
cision to_‘ court. '

Today also the athletic managers of
tlie_Univ_ersit_v, Carnegie Tech and
Duquesne. reiterated their denials that
any athlete at either school is sub-
sidized. Their denials followed a
series of articles in a downtown paper
hinting that paying athletes was a
common practice.

Einstein Speaks
At Math Session

300 Mathematicians, Expected To
Attend Science Parley

 

More than 300 mathematicians are
expected to be in Pittsburgh during
the Christmas holidays to attend the

. meetings of the American Mathemat-

ical Society, the Mathematical Asso-
cia.ti.o.n of- America-.._.t.1i.e__‘rl.c:9.12£23.1r.%tric
Society and ‘tlie National VC-Ollllcll of
Teachers of Mathematics. The meet-
ings are a part of the AAAS conven-
tion. -

 Among the events is the eleventh

Josiah Willard Gibbs lecture, which
is to be delivered by Professor Al-
bert Einstein. He wlll give “An el-
ementary proof of the theorem con-
cerning the equivalence of mass and
energy.” All ineetiiigs except that
featuring Dr. Einstein are open to all
who desire to attend.

Dr_ James S. Taylor, acting head of
the ‘mathematics department, in
charge. of arrangements for the
math-:-imatical meetings, expressed re-
gret that it will be impossible for
Pittsburgli citizens who would like
to hear Dr. Einstein to have the op-
portunity at this time_

In coninienting on the situation, Dr.
Taylor said, “At Professor Einstein’s

reqiiest, the size of the audience is

to be limited to 500. The reason for

this request was that the subject for

discussion is {highly technical and
that it is desirable that those most
vitally concerned should be per-
mitted to hearthe address under the
most favorable .possible conditions.
Arlniission will be by ticket and tick-
ets will be available only to mem-
bers of those mathematical and phy-
sical societies which have been as-
signed liinited allotments for dis-
tribution.”

The mathematics department here
will be represented on the program
by Dr. M. M. Culver, professor of
mathematics, who will 1.‘.1‘eSel1t a paper
entitled “On fundamental regions,"
and by Dr. J. C. Knipp, instructor in
mathematics, who will discuss “The
relation between the Freger surface
and the evolute.” Dr. Rosella Kanarik,
who received her PhD degree from
the University last June, will present
a paper entitled “Fuiidamental re-
srions in S4 for the Hessian group."

Dr. Pickens, Colored Leader, Cites
Economic Factor In Race Prejudice

By James R. Donoghue
Speaking on “The economic basis
of race prejudice,” before the noon
luncheon group under the joint spon-
sorship of the YM-XVHA and the YM-
Vv'=CA at the YMHA Friday, Dr. ‘Nil-
liani Pickens blamed economic rea-
sons as the “biggest single thing” in
race prejudice.

"Other reasons grow out of those
anddevelop the? psychoses which are
a psychological defense against what
we don’t like,” the nationally-known
colored leader declared. Dr. Pickens
went on to explain the lack of color
prejudice throughout history.

“Color prejudice is not a matter of
instinct,” he continued, “but is built
up to justify resentment against a
race for economic reasons. No one
ever wrote a thesis to prove a horse
inferior because that was accepted
without question. The association of
color with psychoses has been due to
environment and education. The
crowd that has been exploited has al-
ways been despised.”

Race prejudice since the Civil war

has not been caused by the negro’s

having to adopt himself to new condi-
tions, but to the inability of the
“slaveholder” to adapt himself to the

 

new situation.” The slave is much
more willing to adapt himself, he as-
sorted. .

Dr. Pickens described negro educa-
tion since the Civil war as “the fast-
est learning process in liistory_ Al-
though we started from scratch, 80
people out of 100 can read and write
today. And what is more, there are
3,600 inventions credited to iiegroes,
as you can easily verify in \Vashi1ig-
ton.”

One dollar out of every ten in
Mississippi is used to educate the col-
ored population. Moro colored peo-
ple leave the United States every
year than come in. ‘Census ﬁgures
do not show this because “I know
families in Alabama who have not
been counted for over forty years.”

“Race purity,” said Dr. Pickens, “is
a great niytli. The. negro in earlier
times was darker tlian he is now, but
that was proba.bl_v because he didirt
know so many white folks.”

Commenting on popula.r beliefs
that cannibalism is LL cliaracteristic
of negoes in Africa, Dr. Pickens‘
stated that until the beginning of the
19th century there was cannibalism
in Europe.

USEFUL IDEA is the one
most recently taken up by the
Uiversity Assembly to increase
the range of student athletics this}
intramural
leagues in basketball. ' '

The Engineers, the Dents, the
Meds and the ROTC have agreed
to sponsor divisions of their own,
with the probability that other
special groups will organize divi-
sions. CPSF meanwhile plans to,
continue interfraternity matches
in basketball following the suc-
cess of its touch-football program.
At some date in the early spring,
then, it is proposed to pit. the
champion intramural quintet
against the ranking interfrater-
nity team.

The University Assembly will
do something more than brood
lovingly over the scene, too, if the?‘
leagues are successful, inasmuch.
as another playing floor, in addi-
tion to the Trees gyninasium floor,
has yet to‘ be secured. Moreover,
the Assembly entertains the idea
of offering some sort of trophy to
the winners.

'We are not disturbed at the
suggestion that the league plan
will intensif-y so-called natural
sectionalisms between the Dents
and the Engineers, or the Meds
and the ROTC. or that the frater-
nity vs. non-fraternity question
will be settled on a basketball
court. Getting two hundred-or-so
into approximately accurate bas-
ketball costumes and into approx-
imately regular games is an end
in itself, no matter what the score,
or whether anybody actually
scores at all.

The new plan, however, ad-
vances student athletics only part i
of the way; and several hundred

unorganized. students who are out-
side of freshman gym classes, fra- 
ternitics and the ROTC have little 1

chance of getting into the newe

rleagues. If interest in athletics:

exists among this group of under- 
-graduates, and we think it does,§

the Assembly might carry on its‘
good work by ‘inquiring 111 their
increased gy1nna.-
slum, swimming and ﬁeld sched-
ules.

 

Registration Speeds Up

HE INTENSE activity in the

registrar’s office these days,
centering around the construction
of the second semester schedule
and the preparation of a multi-
tude of registration forms, is a
reminder tliat before long stu-
dents will be enrolling for the sec-
ond semester.

Before that eventuality comes
off, of course, there will be in-
tense activity in other directions,
too. The preparation of a mul-
titude of registration forms is
suggestive of a multitude of ex-
aminations, reports and papers.

But. this winter, students who
qualify in their exams and papers
will not be numbed by a long reg-
istration procedure at the begin-
ning of the second semester. The
chief obstacle to speed, before,
has been the requirement that stu-
‘dent schedules be both advised
and plotted by members of the
faculty. A bottle-neck situation
occurred, where registrants piled
up against a brave little band of
faculty advisers with w-riter’s
cramp.

Mr. Quick ’s new plan will con-
ﬁne faculty members working at
registration to the single function
of advice, as students will be
given facilities for making out
their own schedules. A good many
of the conflicts that are scheduled
every year because a faculty ad-
viser cannot know that his sub-
ject sleeps late or needs two

out. More fundamental content-
ment, of course, should result
from students being able to select
their own instructors, as well as
their own hours. The whole pro-
cess should be speeded up notice-
ably, and faculty advisers should
be able to concentrate on some
very elegant advice. ’

Question In The Air

PPARENTLY SETTLED for

the moment by the willingness

of both parties to leave their dif-

ferences to the League of Nations,

the Jugoslaviaii-Huiigarian crisis

cases and the European war is
prevented again.

The strength of the League and
the change in national diplomatic
psychology that directed the prob-
lem to the League are encourag-
ing, even with the accoinpaiiyiiig
reflection that it was more fear
than faith that sent the Hunga-
rian foreign ollice’s instructions
to their Geneva representative:
“Vote with the League.”

The recollection of similar crises
and similar solutions-for-thc-mo-

» ment, however, which anticipated

the \Vorld war during more than
35 years, refuses to be forgotten.
To the question: “CAN the
United'Statcs manage to stay out
of a European conﬂict?” the an-
swer is YES. 'l‘o the question:
“VVILL the United States manage
to stay out?” the answer, from all
present and past indications, is
N0.

No sign appears that the United
States is going to depart from its
policy of actively protecting its
imperialisizic interests abroad, and
on this basis every student needs
to ask himself the question: “\Vil1
I bear arms in the invasion of an-
other territory?”

The same question is ’ being
asked at scores of Aiiierican col-
legcs This 1110111711, in a ﬂood of
questionnaires and self—examina-
lion.

What Does She Tliiiik?
E HAT DOES the college girl

think about war in a war-
tlireatened world? Does she stir
to the possibility of conflict in Eu-
rope, South America, the East?
ls “tomorrow ’s mother merely a
dance partner or is she a. citizen
of a nation and a world?”

These are some of the questions
that the editor of the Barnard Col-
lege Quarterly asked presidents
of the student bodies of 74- wo-
men’s colleges this month. The
questionnaire consisted of two
pages asking for the names and
activities of anti-war organiza-
tions on each campus and the war
aititiides of student body, faculty,
dean and student newspaper.

The most. evident indication is
that the anti-war movement. is a
sectional one. Thirty-two colleges
in southern United States were
polled; ﬁve ﬁlled out the ques-
tionnaire and returned it. Thirty-
one in northern United States
were polled; ten replied. Four
out of eleven in the “Test and
Middle “Vest answered. Rough-
ly, one-sixth of the southern col-

leges were interested: one-third"

of the westerners, and one-third
of the northerners.

Among the answers which the
Barnard Qua.rterl_v quotes are the
following from southern student
body leaders.

From a. Virginia college of 450
women: “There are few girls
really interested in the subject of
war. \Vhen discussion arises on
the subject most of them declare
themselves opposed to aggressive
warfare but are not paciﬁsts.”

A Georgia student explains the
apparent lack of interest in the
South: “We in the South live in
an atmosphere which in some way

hours for lunch are on the way

seems remote from the strife and

VVhile city and county officials here
are trying to garner additional rev-
enue by placing University property
on the taxing lists, the Philadelphia
Daily News carries an expose of the
tax—exempt properties of the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania.

The paper's denunciation included
fraternity houses and Franklin Field
used by Pennsylvania for the same
purpose our University uses the Sta-
dium, the central point in the local
tax-exemption ﬁght.

The Field was one of the principal
points of attack. The writers of the
article showed that football could no
longer be regarded as a mere college
pastime but should be classified as a
lucrative business.

The. Daily News article, according-

to a. review in the Daily Pennsyl-
vanian, campus newspaper, “claimed
in its best demagogical style that the
people of this city are paying doubly
for something from which they receive
absolutely no beneﬁt.”

Fraternity houses were branded as
the clubs of rich men’s sons.

By Edwin P. Banks

HE TIME SEEMS TO have come again when somebody should‘;

point out that scholasticism is a phenomenon which still shows
unusual vitality. Back in the Dark Ages, you will remember, the phil-
osophers and political scientists and economists based all their pole-

mic conclusions on the Bible.

By ferreting out phrases from the

Scripture, they could prove that any side of any controversy had

divine sanction.

The. Holy Book established deﬁnitely to some that

the ‘Church was superior to the secu-¢
lar government. For others the Bible-
stated as deﬁnitely that the Prince‘

was ordained by God to govern as he
pleased without interference by any
other agency.

We moderns of the Less Dark Ages
are inclined to smile sophistlcatedly

at such a method of conducting de-
bate as the scholastics used. We be-
lieve we have outgrown authoritarian-
ism. We say, we want the status quo
or we want a particular -reform be-
cause we think it is desirable for cer-
tain practical reasons. We do not
claim that we had a seance with our
deceased mother-in-law and that she
told us what was the right thing to
do. We think that we are too mature
to need a Delphian oracle to legislate
for us.

Modern Idols

 Strangely enough, though, the world
of 1934 does have its graven images
before which groups of men bow, im-
ages from which these men claim to
have received divine messages. Two
of these images are outstanding. One
is Marxism, the other the American
Constitution.

"The .works of Karl Marx are, of
course, the” Bible of the Russians._ By
pouring over the pages of Das Kaj'pi-
tal and the rest, the Communist lead-
ers discover that whatever new pro-
gram they institute the great Ger-
niau recommended it by express
statement or implication years ago.
When there-is a -squabble within-the
Party, you may be sure that the op-
posing factions are both quoting from
Marx to back up their contentions.

‘The apotheosis of the Constitution
of the United 'States is a remarkable
The document was
adopted through the efforts of less
than ten percent of the American
public. Leading patriots denounced
it. But since 1739 the Constitution
has come to be virtually deiﬁed by
organizations and individuals inter-
ested in its gloriﬁcation.

The Su-

ly differing conclusions from

sacred source.

The arguments of present day po-
litical groups follow similar authori-
tarian principles. The American Lib-

one

: erty League, for example, defends pri-

vate property rights in this fashion:
The Constitution upholds private
property; everybody knows that the
Constitution is perfect; therefore. the
right to private property is funda-
mental, inviolable, and weyare-bound
to recognize’ that right and to protect
it. And yet the President, Father
Coughlin, and others have studied
the Constitution and determined
therefrom that it places “human”
rights above property rights.
People who have contempt for the
scholastic method do not necessarily
have contempt for the graven images.
They do not necessarily object to the
Bible, Karl Marxism, or the American
Constitution in itself, Their quarrel
is with the attempt by the scholastics
to make an idol——something perfect
and divine———out of something purely
human, and, being human, fallible.

Popular Dislikes

' People who dislike the authoritar-
ian tactics of the monks of the Middle

Ages, the Bolsheviks, and the Amer-

ican Liberty League maintain that
these groups have tried to force their
private opinions on the masses in the
guise of supernatural acts. With
very few exceptions, the dead and liv-
ing scholastics have been completely

aware, in their ownmind, that the

god they wanted the masses to wor-
ship was man—created and lifeless.

;trol over the secular affairs, They
gleaned such phrases from the Bible.
as supported their desire. Then they
urged the masses to accept their
cla.ims———because they knew that the
masses believed in the divinity of the
-Scriptures. James 11 used the same
method in his divine right of kings
doctrine. The Communists know that
the Russian masses worship Lenin
and the latter’s Marxism. The Com-
munists then label every new “of-
fensive” as if it were according to
Marx, and, hence, unquestionably
good. The American Liberty League
feels that the masses of our countrv
still adore the Constitution. The
League. consequently, -proclaims tli-at
rugged individualism is an unalterable
law of nature because the Constitu-
tion is based on it.

Until the masses have ceased to
bow before idols sculptored by men,
scholasticism will probably continue

to thrive. Not until that visionary
time, will the world have all its
churchmen, statesmen, and class

spokesmen advocating proposals sini-
ply-for the reason that the proposals
have an immediate practical desira-
bility.

Cause For Alarm

Students at Hiram college (Ohio),
aided by volunteer ﬁremen, recently
fought an all-night battle against the
ﬂames which destroyed the school’s
administration building.

Action
The University of Colorado has
more than 2,000 students actively en-
gaged in social. honorary, and pro-
fessional fraternities and sororities.

Panthers Finish
Mid-WestJaunt
At Indianapolis

Meet Butler Quintet Tonight;
0 Drop First Game Of Tour
To Northwestern Five

Concluding the current mid-
western invasion, Dr. Carlson
sends his Panther basketball

team against a strong Butler ﬁve
at Indianapolis tonight in an at-
tempt to close the tour success-
fully by clawing the tough But-
ler quintet into submission, thus gain-
ing at the same time revenge for the
35-24 defeat suﬁﬁered at the hands 01'
Butler last season.

In the past the Butler outﬁt has
always been a particularly sharp thorn
in the side of the Panthers, annually
popping up with strong basketball

.teams that are classed with tliebest,

on the Pitt schedule. This year’s But-
ler ﬁve proves no exception to the
rule, if early season games can be
taken as an example. In the two
games proceeding tonight’s battle with
the Panthers the Butler varsity has
romped to easy wins over Earlham
and Indiana Central.
Hinkle Builds New Team

In spite of the fact that Coach
Tony Hinkle lost four of the ﬁve men
on last year’s varsity through gradua-
i.ion,. another good team has been

I built up from the reserves and new

men. At center is the lone‘ returning
member of the 1933-34 Butler varsity,
Gene Demmary, around whom this
season's starting lineup is built. Two
of last year’s reserves, Roy Jones and
Earl Overman, return to team at the
forward positions, while two letter-
men of last year, Scott Armstrong
and Roscoe Batts, take care of the
guard posts.

For the Golden Pathers, Coach Carl-

son probably will stick to the lineup
that has playedi against Bucknell,
Northwestern, and Iowa thus ‘far this
season. This starting lineup will
have at the forwards Skippy Hughes
and Ted Roderick, towering Pete
Noon at center, and round out with
Claire -Cribbs and Ross Emrick as the
guards. Coach ‘Carlson will probably
use most of the players that have
been taken on the trip sometime or
other during the evening’s battle, in-
asmuch as the strain of three games
in four nights may begin to tell on
the boys. '
_ Following the game with Butler to-
night the Panthers will start imme-
diately for home, resting and practic-
ing until December 29, when the Pitt
team will return to the‘ mid—Western
territory for a game against Wiscon-
sin at Madison. »

Pitt Loses To Northwestern

Pop! went Pitt’s hopes’ for an un-
defeated basketball season when the
Purple cagers of Northwestern did
the Golden Panthers up brown at
Evanston Friday night. After gaining
a 31-9 advantage over a ragged Pan-
t_her outfit in the first half, the Wild-
cats held off a second—half Pitt rally
to win, 42-28.

The Carlson ﬁrst-string ﬁve failed
to score a ﬁeld goal in the first 14
minutes of play while the Northwest-
crners were counting up 19 points.
Pitt's second team, led by Billy Jesko,
had more of an eye for the basket,
putting the count up to nine at the
half.

Fisher, Purple forward, had 17
points for his evenings total. His
teammate. Mercer, counted 10 and
Emrick, Pitt guard, had nine,

The defeat was the worst one suf-
fered by the Panthers since Purdue
shellacked them, 42-21, three years

For Riﬂe Squad

Thirteen Sophomore Candidates
Qualify For Varsity Posts

Thirteen sophomores, eight juniors
and four seniors will compose this
year’s varsity riﬂe squad. Only three
veterans of last year’s first team,
Vveitershausen, Shapira and Taussig,
will continue to hold down their posi-
tions again this season.

The squad is not composed of only
ROTC men, as many students believe,
but of men from every school in the
University. The rifle team is one of
the major sports included in the
school's curriculum and participation
is open to all students who satisfy the
markmanship requirements. Member-
ship in the ROTC is not essential.
Varsity letters are awarded just as
in all other major sports.

A postal match, the first for the
teams, is scheduled for the week of
January 12. Later in the season Pitt
marksmen will travel to Annapolis to
compete in the National Intercolle-
giate matches. Shoulder-to—shoulder
matches with Tech and VVest Virginia
are being considered.

Pitt emerged as regional champions
of the National Riﬂe association last
year and the following riﬂers com-
posing this season’s squad, will en-
deavor to keep this championship for
Pitt: A. R. Davis, L. C. Truman, J. A.
Clark, A, T, Duff, J, C. Duff, ‘N. S.

University Will Sponsor
Frosh Wrestling .Team

Any freshman desiring to add his
name to the roster of those who have
earned numerals in a frosh sport is
invited to report to Earl Oster, wrest-
ling coach, any afternoon this week
after 3 o'clock. The forming of- a
freshman team depends upon the num-
ber of candidates who report to Oster.
A freshman schedule has not as yet
been arranged.’

The-varsity is also calling for can-
didates and especially in the 155 and
the 175 pound classes. There is no
reason to worry about weight
classes range from 118 pounds to the
heavyweight class.

Pitt-Duquesne Tickets

Students desiring tickets for the
Pitt-Duquesne -basketball game on
Friday evening, January 4, will be
able to get tickets on either Thursday,
January 3, or Friday, January 4. A
student exchange will cperate on both
these days. -

Boxers Approach
Top Form Early

Schricker Has Many Promising
Candidates Out For isquad,

Two weeks of training and exhibi-
tion ﬁghting appears to be the neces-
sary tonic for the candidates working
for positions on the 1934 varsity box-
ing team. for the entire squad is rapid-
ly rounding into form.

Although the number of candidates
is much larger this year than in the
past, Coach Schricker is still short of
men for the 155, 165 and 175—pound
weight classes. Schricker requests
that any student with an interest in
boxing in any one of these weight
classes report to the stadium for the
team practice sessions. ' 

[Around The Ring

Fred Ziegler, a 128-pound boy, lo.oks
promising. His conﬁdence and com-
petitive spirit should make - him ,a
boxer.

A1 Paslowski, weighing 123 pounds,
looks like a sure bet for either the
118 or 128-pound class. He possesses
a good left, which would prove much
more effective if he would mix an oc-
easinnal right hand punch with his
attack. 

Joe Kopp, 165—pound candidate, is
the best-conditioned man on the
squad. When Kopp develops a left
he will cause a lot of trouble for ring
opponents. He has plenty of power
in his right, but it lands" too infre-
quently. > -2

Bernie Spiegel is one of the best col-
logiate boxers in this district. Ber-
nie holds the distinction of never
having‘ fought a man in his own
weight class in two years of varsity
competition. He should go places
ﬁghtingin his own weight division,

Jimmie _Giannatti, ca-ptafin v of the
team, ﬁghts in the 135-pou_nd class.
Jimmie is one of the best collegiate
boxers in the East. 1

Ray Tomarelli is probably the most
improved boxer from last year’s team.
He is a good boxer as well asf a
puncher. ‘ 

Milt Goldberg, a strong contender
for the 155-pound berth, is one of the
few left-handed hitters 011 the squad.
Once Milt gains some conﬁdence‘:-in
his -ability he should be a hard man
to beat. . :._:

There will be six practice periods
for the members of the boxing squad
during the Christmas recess. Practices
will be held at 1:30 o’clock on De-
cember_l21, 22, 23, -28,29 andi31.
