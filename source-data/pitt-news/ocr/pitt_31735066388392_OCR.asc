Robert Hess, the third finalist in
the presidential search, discussed
re-evaluating undergraduate
education and enhancing
diversity during his visit to Pitt
last week.

Hess, the 59-year-old president
of Brooklyn College, met with
members of the university
community as part of his April 4
and 5 stay. Hess said that Pitt and
Brooklyn College have similar
structures, settings and dilemmas.

“This institution has so many of
the elements which have been
component parts of my life at one
time or another, so that ifl were
to come here, I would feel that

the opportunity to continue the
process of institutional building,”
he said at Friday’s Student Affairs
Advisory Committee meeting,
adding that he has “very old-
fashioned values, like wantingto
change the world and make it a
better place.” ‘

Hess has spent almost 44 years
on college campuses, starting as
an assistant professor of history
and economics at Carnegie Mellon
(then Carnegie Tech). After
several teaching and
administrative positions at a
number of universities, including
the University of Illinois at
Chicago, Hess assumed his

3rpresz'dent2'aI{finalist visits campus

present duties at Brooklyn in
1979. '

Upon his arrival at Brooklyn,
Hess said the college started to
find its focus. He said the
challenge was to define how
undergraduate education fit into
the university.

‘‘If I’m not mistaken, some of
the basic issues that are being
raised elsewhere around the
country are now coming to focus
here, that is, what does it mean to
have a undergraduate education
at a university which has such
strong research tendencies? To
me that suggests one should give

Activist: Sexual inequality spurs Violence against Women

By Rebecca Wilkins
Suﬁ" Writer

Sexual inequality is the basis of male
supremacy and violence against women,
according to one pro—feminist activist.

“The whole gender-identity setup is a social
delusion.’ It's a trap; it’s a lie told to keep an
unjust sex-class system in place,” said John
Stoltenberg.

Stoltenberg spoke about “Date Rape: Do
Men Need Sexual Inequality to be Turned
On?” at the Graduate School of Public Health
on Thursday evening.

He has a bachelor's of fine arts in philosophy,
a master's in divinity, and a master's of fine
arts in theater arts.

He is a speaker, writer and pro-feminist
activist on issues of sexual violence and
inequality. '

Almost 300 people attended the event,
including 10 members of the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternity, who wore their Greek
letters and sat together.

“This notion that there should be
polarization by gender-, with men as different
from women as they can possibly be, doesn’t
have anything to do with our nature as
human beings; it has more to do with justifying
the social power of men over women, and it
has to do with a lot of the violence that is
done to keep that sexual hierarchy in place,”
said Stoltenberg.

He discussed the typical man's quest for a
strong masculine identity.

“As an identity it is a social and political
hoax that exists only through personal and
social injustice,” he said.

Stoltenberg gave feminist activism credit
for alerting people to problems of inequality.

“Women have stood up and said clearly
that sexual violence is central to women’s
oppression; sexual violence is the bedrock of
male supremacy; sexual violence —violence
committed against women just because they
are women and because men can get away
with it — is the fundamental mechanism of
sexual inequality,” he said.

“As long as there is rape, women will
always be kept “in their place” —subordinate
to men — those who do the raping.”

Stoltenberg cited four predominant aspects
of sexual inequality.

.0 Sexual objectification, which is “the
thingiﬁcation of [women]; it’s turning someone
into a thing to be possessed, to be used
according to one’s will.”

~Male bonding, where “'other men are
demanding that you swear a loyalty oath to
masculinity and male supremacy."

-Homophobia, “a consequence of male
supremacy and an enforcer of male
supremacy. It keeps men doing to women
what they would not want done to
themselves.”

0 Pornography, which maintains women as
sex objects and “recuntiﬁes” them.

“Each functions in keeping inequality sexy, "
said Stoltenberg.

Stoltenberg said sexual inequality can be
conquered.

Lisa R., a senior at Taylor

I Allderdice High School, has been

repeatedly abused in school

, because she is openly gay. Forced

to enter school through a side
entrance because of threats, Lisa
carries Mace when she walks to
class.

“The violence has gotten worse.
Walking through the halls, my

‘friends and I, whether we're gay
or not,  are called dykes. We

. have things thrown at us, and

I . we're shoved. One of the most
‘extreme cases is when  I was

punched in the jaw and called a
dyke. It’s very frightening,” Lisa
said.

Lisa was one of 50 members of

’Pittsburgh’s gay community who

gathered Thursday night at the

William Pitt Union for the first-

ever Queer Nation meeting.
The group attracted people

throughout the city and represents"

the first time a group has gathered
in such a capacity. Designed to
combat homophobia and to raise

public awareness of the concerns
of homosexuals, Queer Nation
joins a network of chapters in
other major American cities.
“We are beginning history here
in Pittsburgh,” said group
facilitator Constance Mayer. “This
is meant to find out whowe are
and what it is that we want to do
as a Queer Nation in Pittsburgh.”
The name chosen for the grou p
is used in part to dispel existing
stereotypes of gays and lesbians
and to promote unity in the
community. “[‘Queer’l is such an
ineffectual word. There's a lot of
power in language  We're just
taking away power from the
homophobe,” said co-facilitator

, Jim Crow.

In what was called “the coming-
out party that never happened,”
members discussed the pressures
of living as a homosexual among
a heterosexual majority. One
member, Scott Smith,-talked about
the misconceptions the straight
community has about gays and
lesbians.

“I always felt like ‘queer’ was
being defined from the outside,”

he said.

Most members said they joined
Queer Nation to raise the visibility
of gays in Pittsburgh so that
homosexuals can avoid

’ discrimination. _
“I think we need to forge an

identity of lesbian, gay and
bisexual people that says that we
come in all races and sexes, and
that racism and sexism and
heterosexism and classism are
linked  We can’t talk about one
without talking about all of them, "
said Carol Moeller, one of the
founders of Queer Nation. “An
attack on one of us is an attack
on all of us.”

Members also discussed the
difference between the
acceptance of heterosexual and
homosexual couples. Several
people shared experiences in
which they were abused for
showing affection toward their
lovers in public. “One of the
things I would like to do is live in
a more social way,” said local
politician Tom McGill, who is

Borough Council as an openly

gay candidate.

“Every issue is a queer issue,”
said John Fagan, a member of
Pittsburgh’s CRY OUT!/ACT UP.

According to Fagan, gay
organizations often have to
decrease their attention on the
problem of AIDS in order to
focus on other social problems.
With the inception of Queer
Nation in Pittsburgh, the AIDS
organization will be freed up to
focus more on finding a cure for
AIDS. '

In order to channel the group’s
energy into positive activities and
raise the group’s proﬁle, Queer
Nation is planning to take part in
several upcoming activities in the
gay community, including the
Pride Parade and a get-together
at Kennywood Park.

First, the group is planning to

go shopping at Ross Park Mall
this Saturday, April 13. Members
will stamp their currency with a
pink stamp that says, “Gay
Money”.

U-PARC location for diverse ousinesses

By Margaret Swisher

' Staﬂ“ Writer

0"his is the 2nd segment of a
ﬁve—pant series on the University
of Pittsburgh Trust.) V

When can an environmental

center, law firm, dentist’s office‘

and volunteer fire company all
be found at the same facility?
When they are one of the 151
businesses located at the
University of Pittsburgh Applied
Research Corporation.

PARC is one of ﬁve entities in
the University of Pittsburgh Trust
that operates and manages U-
PARC. U—PARC is located at the
former site of the Gulf Oil
Corporation’s Research and
Development Center in
Harmarville.

This facility was donated to

_ the university in March 1986 by

the Chevron Corporation.

In less than five years, the 55
buildings on the 85—acre site are
practically ﬁlled. “U-PARC today
has about 151 separate tenant

family. In a statement by Pitt
President Wesley Posvar, he said,
“The University of Pittsburgh, this
city and the state of Pennsylvania
lost a great friend and inspirational
leader with the death of John
Heinz. Senator Heinz’s

1' contributions to education, to the

arts and to the quality of American
life are extraordinary and far-
reaching." . _

Posvar also expressed his
condolences to the families‘ of
the others killed in the crash.

Jacinta Dvorak, newly elected
president of College Republicans,
said that Heinz’s death stunned
her. . *

“It was a shock to hear of the
senator’s death," she said. “I met

- him injanuary, and he was really

a nice man. He was really pro-

- Pennsylvania. He worked hard

for the elderly as well as the
people of this state.”

Dvorak said that she was most
impressed with Heinz’s memory.
“Whenever someone would come
up and introduce themselves and
tell him where they were from,
he could tell them something
about that town,” she said. “His
knowledge of the state was

“ amazing.”

Heinz was on his way to

‘Philadelphia for a meeting with

Medicare recipients when the
accident occurred. His plane,
which apparently developed

_ mechanical problems, collided

with a helicopter over an
elementary school. Six others,
including two children were
killed.

companies, which is amazing,”
said Richard Jewell, former
president of PARC. “About 84
percent of U-PARC is filled, and
we hope to be in a sellout by
early summer.” ‘

PARC also provides sundry
petroleum and automobile engine
tests for many of the world’s oil
companies, according to Jewell.
“We are doing a lot of research

and testing of various things for a .

whole host of the leading oil and
chemical companies both here
and overseas,” said Jewell.

Businesses came to the
Harmarville facility for a variety
of reasons.

“One is [that] you couldn’t find
comparable space in Oakland.
Or because of the array of
scientific testing» and
instrumentation found here. This
facility would serve as a magnet
for a number of projects that
would have used of those kinds
of things,” Jewell said.

U—PARC is a center for research
projects by chemistry and

"engineering professors at Pitt.

“About 50,000 square feet under
lease is university—sponsored
research projects worthy of
contracts,” said Jewell.

“The balance are the third—party
tenants who rent space here,” he

said.

Over 30 of the companies at U-
PARC are related to the
environment, and for this reason
U-PARC’s location is ideal.

“Pennsylvania "and New Jersey
have more Superfund sites than
any other state.

"Pittsburgh is right in the heart.
It draws a 600-mile radius of
about 60 or 70 percent of the
environmental problems. This
location is perfect,” he said.

Jewell said the university has
returned the site to an even more
prominent position than when
Gulf owned it. _

“The university chose not to
have it exempted from property
tax, and so we payga substantial
amount of taxes from our
operating income. It goes right
back into the local community,"
he said.

Future generations of Pitt students will

see the name of Nathan Urban etched in

stone as he joins past honorees on Pitt’s
Walk of Fame.

On the Walk of Fame, Omicron Delta
Kappa annually honors students who have
served their university well through
intelligent‘ leadership, personal integrity
and intellectual honesty. The walk dates
back to 1922 and runs from the Cathedral
[of Learning to Bellefield Avenue.

Urban was named “Senior of the Year”
by ODK at the annual Honors Convocation.

Urban was named a Pitt Chancellor's
Scholar. He was one of eight students to
receive the award as a freshman and has
been active in both academic and indep-
endent study a_pd research. He has a
double major in behavioral neuroscience
and a combined major of mathematics and
philosophy.

Urban developed the first Scholars
Program at Pitt with another student. The
program is designed to attract academically
motivated high school seniors to the
university. It is one of the few programs of
its kind in the country.

“We saw a need on this campus. We
wanted to make opportunities known to
groups of academically motivated high
school seniors,” Urban said. He said he

Urban developed the program two years

it awards six scholarships annually, valued
at $1,000-$2,000 a year, and renewable for
four years. -

The students working in the program
give tours to high school seniors during
the summer and also give an exam which
decides the scholarship winners. Urban
made up the exam, which was evaluated
by graduate students and faculty members
that Urban selected.

Urban served as a panel member at a

‘a hard look at undergraduate

education here," he said.

A more structured educational
experience, where the research
and undergraduate programs
work closely together and the

-vast resources of a major
institution are utilized by more

students, is the solution Hess said
was successfully attempted at

- Brooklyn.

“The research institution that

 re—evaluates undergraduate

education and comes up with
new dimensionsis going to move
into 'a position of leadership,”
Hess said. “At a research university
you have to have doubts about
where the priorities lie because
you see huge buildings going up,
you see publicity, and in terms of
sheer numbers, it’s the undergrads
who are being processed by the
institution that are going to be the
difference.”

Student Government Board
President Brent Saunders

questioned Hess about his views
on affirmative action.
Hess, who has taught numerous

   

  & MUCH

      

$10/STUDENTS -

courses and published papers
on African history, said, “Diversity
is important to build into the
students’ experience because the
student who graduates now is
going to live in the 21st century
in which the diversity becomes
more and more intense, and the
student who has come out of a
single cultural background who

has remained in an isolated‘

cocoon in an isolated college is
going to be at a disadvantage.”

As universities recognize the

need for an increase in minority
faculty, Hess said they are finding
out that they are in a no-win
situation because of the lack of
minorities in graduate and
professional schools.

He said Brooklyn College is
one of the few campuses in the
nation where graduation rates
were equal for minority and non-
minority students. Hess_said that
the Ofﬁce of Affirmative Action
at Brooklyn plays an integral role
in this.

One solution at Brooklyn was
to change recruitment techniques,
Hess said. At Brooklyn the deans

advertised for faculty in more
diverse publications and used
standardized search processes in
an effort to include all segments
of the population. In addition,
Hess said the Affirmative Action
Office works closely with faculty
searches, identifying possible
minority candidates.

Black Action Society
Chairperson Marta Effinger and
BAS Deputy Chairperson Justin
Laing questioned Hess about his
views on diversity in college
curriculum.

Hess said that he did not feel
that teaching completely from
either an Eurocentric or
Afrocentric perspective was ideal.
At Brooklyn, he said the

administration required all
students to take a course about
Asian, African and Latin American
cultures.

He said that when professors
teach from a completely Western
European historical point of view,
“it is not deliberate.” He said that
the problem lies with the
educational perspective received
by many professors.

“The next generation moving
up is sensitive to the issues, but
because they have not been
steeped themselves in the
background, bring with it a kind
of ignorance. Well—meaning, well-
intended, but not knowing how
to do it, because they themselves

be familiar to you in terms of the
highlights of African history or
Asian history,” Hess said.

Diversified education is the key
to changing the system, Hess
said. ’

“If the university finds a way of
giving that student an education
which has extra dimensions, then
competitively it becomes a better
institution; your degree is worth
more,” Hess said.

Panhellenic President Sandra
Kramer asked Hess about his
impressions of the role of Greeks
on campus.

Hess said that he has seen a
resurgence at Brooklyn of the

number of minorities becoming V

Greek. "

He gave the example of one
fraternity consisting of African—
American members who chose
to use Egyptian symbols rather
than Greek letters to identify their
fraternity.

He added that Greeks have
been the largest fund raisers on
campus and in many respects
have tried to get away from elitism

ROTC q

ROTC Day in Pittsburgh.

The battalion colors were cased
to symbolize the inactivation of
the present chain of command,
but “the colors live forever, even
if a unit goes “away,” said Lt. Col.
Michael Geoghagan, professor

-of military science.

“I’ve taken an old Army
tradition and applied it to, a
university setting,” he said. 

Geoghagan said he is being-
transferred to Fort Bragg, 1}I._C.,
to serve as the training officer for
the first ROTC region. 

“Every unit I've ever served in
has a little place in my heart. A
little place in my heart belongs to
Pitt,” he said. ' -

Lt. Col. Michael Cassatori will
succeed Geoghagan in the fall as
professor of military science. .

Pitt’s CROTC battalion has
distinguished itself in the past

three years by founding the first _

military fraternity at Pitt;

reactivating Scabbard and Blade,

the military honor society;

forming a drill team, and

performing well in Ranger

competition, according to
Geoghagan.

Outstanding cadets were
honored at the inactivation
ceremony.

Boniface Ndemping received
an Academic Excellence Award
for attaining a 3.5 quality-point
average, and Sharon Debbage
received an Academic
Achievement Award. Nick
Alexander was presented with
the Society-of Military Engineers
Award.

Battalion Commander Awards
for Military Excellence were given
to Katie McShane, Angel
Geoghagan andjason McKenzie.

Lt. Col. Geoghagan said he is
proud of Pitt’s status as a
“founding father" of the ROTC
program.

“I still have the original
contract which said Pitt has to
take care of my horses,”
Geoghagan said.

There's a rumor circulating around campus
that Pitt President Wesley Posvar was overheard
' last week saying, “No one named Gershon will

be president if I have anything to say about it.”
Tough talk for a guy whose middle name is
A Wentz.

Nancy Reagan: Well, maybe not.

Dr. Space and the Sleaze: They need the

’ Richard Nixon: His story could make a good
book after we impeach him.
Homer Simpson: He’s popular and not smart
enough to be corrupt, dude.
Ted Nugent: He never wears anything he
. doesn't kill himself. Hey, it’s not a fault. Besides,
he’d do wonders for-the music department.
Walter Mondale: You gotta love a guy whose
friends call him “Fritz.”
Tipper Gore: She’s the only person who
wouldn't have a personality conflict with John

decides to designate the mosque
as such, then it cannot be torn
down, _and no external changes
can be made to it without permis-
sion from the city of Pittsburgh.

I am completely against govern-
ment historical designation of the
Syria Mosque. The Syria Mosque is
private property. If the ‘owners
want to tear it down, then they
should be permitted to do so.

There is also reason to believe,
that government historical desig-
nation of the Syria Mosque would
be unconstitutional. The Fifth
Amendment states, “...' nor shall
private property be taken for public
use without just compensation.”

In the past two weeks, numerous
people in the news media have
been speaking out in favor of his-
torical designation of the mosque.
I have not heard a single person
speak out against it.

Since there are so many people
who want to save the mosque, I'm
sure that if they all got together,
they could probably get enough
money to buy it themselves.

For some reason, the media have
not been trying to start any type of
fund-raising project to save the
mosque. Instead, they would rather
use the coercive powers of gov-
ernment to achieve their goals.

I may be the only person in the

" I would like to commend Mr.
Babinsack for his concern and the
time he took to write to The Pitt
News regarding the Representa-
tive Student Council. I would also
like to further address the repre-
sentation issue.

So, one person upset about the
demise‘ of RSC genuinely cared
enough to respond to my comments
at the March 15 [Student Govern-
ment Board] meeting —— one per-
son. Joseph Babinsack, president,
Gaming Club, was correct in his
assertion that the RSC was to help
the SGB have more interaction
with the students and checks of
SGB power. The real reason why
RSC never realized these goals is a
direct result of lack of RSC repre-
sentation, which prevented it from
realizing these goals, not, as stated,
SGB apathy.

To be perfectly clear, not only
did SGB spend hundreds of dollars
(student activities fees) in PittNews
ads, but in addition, several mail-
ings were sent out to each of the
207 student groups; approximately
30 phone calls were made prior to
each of the last two meetings;
agendas were made up to give the
meetings a touch of professional-
ism,‘ and many hours were spent
by the board planning the meetings
and getting guest speakers. The
Office of the Student Government
Board took these actions because

RSC‘ was,-not able:.to.do so on its.

own. Is this nothing?- _.

The SGB is, I assure you, at least
as concerned about RSC’s lack of
effectiveness as you are. Yes, we
did, most of us, inour. campaigns,

pledge to.be representative, and I .

feel that we have been doing quite
_well inthat regard; however, I do
‘believe that more voices would in
fact be even more representative.

RSC was an organization with fewer '

people attending than the SGB
itself. -To call itself the Representa-
tive Student Council, was ironic to
say the least.
I The SGB was hoping for a dedi-
cated membership that was willing
to share ideas, to report back to
their individual groups, to really be
representative. In fact, RSC was
just a name, with very little repre-

sentation, and so the SGB is now

looking for a new path. The very

«same day Mr. Babinsack’s editorial
appeared in The Pitt News, [SGB]
President Brent Saunders and my-
self met with representatives from
the eight; governance groups to
discuss a future representative
body.

So you see, the SGB did not
terminate RSC at all, nor did the
board renege on its campaign
promises to be representative. In
reality, because RSC was not rep-
resentative and required a good
deal of time and money to succeed,
we felt compelled to ﬁnd another,
better path to representation. If
any student would like to offer
suggestions, our door is always
open.

Adopt bill for justice

Instead of the usual tired argu-
ments about rights and liberties, I
-wish to address another argument
against the adoption of the Brady
Bill: justice. One could suggest that
everyone wait seven days to close
a deal on a car or house. Such a
seven—day waiting period would
permit Revenue and Drug En-

’ forcement agencies to check the

background of the purchaser for
organized-crime and drug-trade
connections. It would allow the
IRS todetect tax cheaters and for
local agencies to detect building-
code and automobile-inspection

-violations. A seven—day wait on

“major purchases” would save lives
lost every year due to violence by

drug traffickers and organized‘

criminal activity, via interference
with the economic viability of such
activities. If this plan sounds like
nonsense to you, then ask yourself
why any law-abiding person who
buys a firearm through legal
channels should have to undergo
an identical process — waiting
seven days to use theirproperty and
having their privacy violated? Why
is it reasonable to submit to col-
lective punishment because one
belongs-to a minority group? How

. would any member. of a minority.

group feel if they were singled out
for punishment due to the acts of
another- member of that group?

Gun owners are a minority group ‘

which normally obeys the law.
Bigotry against a minority group is
an ugly thing, even more so if it _is

institutionalized and legislated.

Minimumwageatmennywood?
In response to Daniel Alman’s
April 1 perspective article oppos-

ing the federally mandated mini- .

mum wage, Iwish to offer a rebuttal.
And what better way to do it than
to cite a local employer of Pitt
students who apparently found a
way to “beat the system?"

Not too long ago, I was one of
hundreds of college students who
depended on Kennywood Park for
summer employment during their
undergraduate careers. During my
first season at Kennywood, the
summer of 1985, my wage was $3
an hour, True, one did get a bonus
of $.30 at the end of the season for
every hour one worked that sum-
mer, provided one survived the
whole season.‘ l...l At any rate, if
youdo the math, you'll see that my
hourly wage plus bonus fell below
the then—minimum wage of $3.35
[per hour]. A

How did such a large employer
of college students get away with
paying sub-minimum wages to so
many people? [...l

“You might be able to live on $3
an hour,” Mr. Alman claims? Dur-
ing the busy parts of the season,
the average Kennywood employee
works upwards of 60 hours a week
(without overtime, of course). I
lived at home, within walking dis-

tance of the park, so I had no ,

transportation costs (which was
instrumental in my seeking em-
ployment there, as I had no car).
Uniform costs were minimal (shirt,
shorts, tennis shoes), and given the
hours we worked (noon—ish to
midnight), we had little opportu-
nity to spend our earnings anyway.
Yet all I was able to save for that

was a little over $2,000. And I

Use better sources '

This letter is in response to the
April 1 column by Daniel Alman
regarding rninimum—wage legisla-
tion. Frankly, Mr. Alman’s analysis
of the issue is shortsighted and
extremely ﬂimsy.

First, Mr. Alman, it is clear that
you have‘ no concept of what it is
to work for a living, nor what it
takes to live on minimum wage.
For your information, even the
new minimum wage of $4.25/hour
puts full-time employees working
for this wage below the national
poverty level. -

Second, the evidence you present
to support your assertions is so
weak, I would venture_ to say it
insults the intelligence of most of
your readers. For instance, you cite
these mysterious entities for evi-

‘ dence — “One person I know" and

. you go on to analyze the views of»

“Another person I know” —— and

“many people,” “politicians” and
“no ‘employer. " What person? What
politicians? What employers? Come
on, you have to do better than that;
this is not a junior high school
newspaper. .-

Third, your concluding statement
is nauseating. “Despite what its
supporters say, the minimum-wage
law is a very bad law. It should be
done away with.” Please, give us
all a break. You and I both know
the issue is not that simple. Do you
have any clue about what elimi-
nating minimum-wage laws would
do to the working men and women
of this country? Think about it.l...l

A factual approach to this or any
issue would be stimulating and
thought-provoking; that’s the stuff
of a free society. I am afraid, Mr.
Alman, that your column amounts
to nothing more than ideological
masturbation. I encourage you to
keep writing, and I encourage you
to present your views on important
issues, but please think before you
write.

— TI-[E PITT NEWS, Monday, April 8, 1991

 

Speaking in defen

Last week, one of my fellow
sportswriters made some
comments that attacked one of
the greatest athletes in the world
today, and I would like to set the
record straight on the man, the
leading candidate for the NBA’s
1991 Most Valuable Player. Ya
know, Sir Charles, Lord Charles,
Charles the Great —- Charles
Barkley. -

In a day and age of overrated
and overpaid prima donnas,
Barkley is the rarest of species.

Fans and critics alike will tell you .

that Barkley is the hardest-
working player in the NBA,

arguably in all of professional.

sports. This man comes to play
every night. Whether it’s the lowly
New Jersey Nets or the two—time
world champion Detroit Pistons,
he gives 110 percent every minute
on the ﬂoor.

After a typically brilliant
performance, there is no boasting
or self-satisfaction, only a promise
to play harder the next time. After
a rare sub—par showing, Charles
will make no excuses but will
objectively take his share of the
blame. He is the ultimate warrior,
an emotional person both on and
off the floor who speaks straight
from his heart. As for his
performances, let’s take a look.

questionable.

Paul Assenmacherj is the “only
reliable reliever. other than Smith.
The starting rotation is counting
on the return of 34-year-old Rick
Sutcliffe from injury. Greg Maddux
has yet to put together one good
season, and Shawn Boskie is
unproven. The most worrisome
problem is the recurring tendinitis
of staff ace Mike Harkey. If his
shoulder doesn’t hold up, the
Cubs will be lucky to finish fourth.

Lucky to finish fourth is what
most people said of the Montreal
Expos last year, but they were
right in it most of the way and will
do so again this year. Adding
Barry Jones makes a strong
bullpen even better. If rookie

J Brian Barnes and youngsters Bill

Sampen and Chris Nabholz can
show that their successes last
season were no fluke, they will
be right there until the end again.
The lineup is full of speedsters,
but they need Larry Walker, Ivan
Calderon and Andres Galarraga
to be consistent power threats to
help out Tim Wallach. The lack
of offensive production from, the
shortstop and catcher positions
will also pose a major problem.
Shortstop and catcher are also
problems for the N ewYork Mets.
Howard Johnson is a candidate
for 40 errors at short. Charlie
O'Brien and Todd Hundley, who
will be lucky to keep their
averages above the Mendoza line,
See East, page 13

Here are a few quick facts to
digest: Currently, Charles is
averaging 28.5 points and 10.4
rebounds per game. He won the
MVP award in February's NBA
All-Star game while pulling down
21 rebounds, tying Wilt
Chamberlain’s all-time record.

And this was an All-Star game.
He wasn’t boxing out Greg Kite
or Jon Koncak here; he was
cleaning the same glass that David
Robinson, Karl Malone andJames
Worthy hoped to clean.

Last year Charles was named
the NBA’s Player of the Year by
The Sporting News and has won
the NBA’s Edge Pivotal Player
Award twice, based purely on
statistics calculated by a computer
for the best all—around player in
the league. In addition, Barkley
has been a unanimous first-team,
All—NBA selection for four
consecutive seasons while
averaging double figures in
rebounding in each one of his
seven seasons and scoring over
25 points per game the last four
seasons. A

consideration that Sir Charles

seasons, due to the unmatched
combination of strength and
speed he packs into his 253-
pound frame. Every night he is
matched up against players who
are six or seven inches taller, and
he still dominates them. He has
twice led the league in offensive
rebounding, the truest measure
of how great a rebounder really

Before the Sixers acquired Ricky
jMahorn from Minnesota, Charles
‘was pulling down 12 to 13 boards
per game each season, including

an astounding 14.6 average in

1985-86. , '

Mahorn and Barkley are known

‘ throughout the league as “Thump

that they needed to win the title.
The Pistons and Mahorn devel-
oped close bonds that were
severed when Detroit manage-

ment left Mahorn unprotected

for the Minnesota Timberwolves

to sign. He lasted there for only

a few weeks before the Sixers
traded for him. Mahorn, carrying
the reputation of basketball’s
toughest low-post defender and
a new moniker of “McNasty,"
brought his intense ferocity to
Philly.

Mahorn was elated, and fresh
off his plane proclaimed, “There
are no more Bad Boys in Detroit.
I started the Bad Boys, and now
the Bad Boys will be ' here in
Philly.” He and Barkley have
developed a close relationship
and have instilled this attitude in‘
the Sixers. They have changed a
weak defensive team into one of
the strongest in the NBA. The
result: the ’199O Atlantic Division

Championship. There was no

Thank God for_ that. He isn’t a
cheap-shot artist or a whining

Crybaby with an ugly mask on his 
face. Charles doesn’t start ﬁghts; , 
he only ﬁnishes them. Laimbeer i ‘R

a role model for the community — 

work he does in Philly and his

Yeah, the Boston Celtics are

New look 
Hackett adds 10 defensive recruits to aid rebuilding effort

By Derek Willis
Staﬂ" Writer

The rich may get richer, but for Pitt

Coach Paul Hackett, “rebuilding” is the

important word.

While seeking to improve his defense
for the upcoming year, Hackett had to
‘contend with the loss of ﬁve of last
season’s top seven tacklers, including
linebacker and leading tackler Craig Gob.

Hackett signed 10 defensive players,

including ParadeAll-American linebacker

Torn Tumulty of Penn Hills High School.
T umulty is one of several inside linebackers
who “will have an opportunity to have an
impact immediately in the fall,” according
to Hackett.
Del Seagraves of Greensboro, N .C., was
I considered one of the top linebackers in
his state. With two inside-linebacker spots

open and several senior outside
linebackers, these two could be in the

running for an important spot.

Another local product, Mike Halapin of
Kiski Area High School, could also add to
the defense. Halapin was a second-team
All-State lineman last season, but he could
move to linebacker.

The defensive line was not an area of
great concern, but Hackett and his staff
signed Florida native Matt Smith, a 6—foot-
5-inch, 270-pound nose guard from Cape
Coral, and Canadian Jim Bordingnon, a
former rugby-player who was discovered
by recruiting coordinator Larry Petroff.

Hackett expressed concern about the
secondary after losing three starters from
last year’s team. The Panthers signed two
defensive backs, Derrick Parker of Delran,
N.J., and Anthony Dorsett of Dallas, Texas.
Dorsett is the son of former Pitt All-

Computing Labs Recruitment Coordinator

  

   

American and Heisman Trophy winner
Tony Dorsett. A

Parker was a ﬁrst-team All-State player
and a three-year starter at cornerback and
tailback in high school, while Dorsett
started only three games at defensive back
his senior year.

Texas continued to be a rewarding
recruiting ground for Pitt, as it signed
Dorsett and Raymond Belvin, an outside
linebacker from El Paso.

But local players, including Tumulty
and Halapin, are also an important part of
the incoming class. Hackett signed versatile
Tony Reardon from Sharon, Pa., who
played linebacker, quarterback and was
also a punter during his prep career.

The ﬁnal defensive player recruited is
another linebacker, Jimmy Morrison of
Virginia, who also saw action at tight end
and punter. '

The Panthers also looked for a punter to
replace departing Brian Greenﬁeld, who
ranked second in the country in punting,
averaging 456 yards a kick.J_unior~college
transfer Kevin Leon will get a long look at
the position.

Leon, like Greenfield, is from California,
and he was a teammate of fellow Panther
recruit Rob Coons. Leon averaged 39.6

yards a punt in his two years at Fullerton

Junior College, which included. a record
69-yard boot.

Overall, the class is not the strongest in
recent years, but Hackett praised it for
wanting to be a part of building a
“program,” and he generally was pleased
with the group. Only Coons and Leon will
participate in spring drills, while the rest
will have to wait until August, when camp
gets under way in Johnstown.

may have to handle the catching
chores since Mackey Sasser, no
Gold Glover to begin with, is
literally unable to get the ball
back to the pitcher.

Trading Bobby Ojeda for Hubie
Brooks may still turn out well,
and the Mets will need Brooks’
production with Darryl
Strawberry gone. But now the
pride of the Mets, the starting
rotation, is showing cracks. Frank
Viola, Doc Gooden and David
Cone are as good a top three as
there is in the league, but there is
trouble after that, especially with
Sid Fernandez out until at least
June. Here’s a news ﬂash; Ron

 

Tel: 648-5623.

Darling is notgood enough to be
a No. 2 starter anywhere else
anymore, and I am really sick of
so-called baseball experts saying
he is.

The Philadelphia Phillies are
better — good enough for fifth
— but they are at least two good
starters, a bullpen and the
development of Wes
Chamberlain and Ricky Jordan
away from contention. Dale
Murphy and Wally Backman

4 deserve a better fate. I wish I

could say the same for Len
Dykstra, but if he were on a
winning team, we would have to
see that disgusting wad of tobacco
dripping out of his mouth. By the

Panther Cricket

Attention All Cricket Players:

Panther Cricket Club has received its shipment of playing equipment and will be
holding its first practice on Wenesday, April 10. We will meet in 963 Benedum
at.4:30 pm and then go to the field for practice. If you want to play cricket inthe
upcoming season, please come to this practice. If it is raining, please come to 963
Benendum anyway, we will try to get an indoor facility if the weather is bad.
Questions and inquiries should be directed to Arthur Clark, Business Manager,

way, how does he breathe with
that thing in his mouth?

The St. Louis Cardinals are
rebuilding. There will be no magic
with Whitey Hertzog gone. Any
chance to get out of the cellar
went out the window with the
injury to Joe Magrane. At least
Jose Deleon is in familiar territory,
being one of the best pitchers on
a really bad staff. He has come up
short of 20 losses a few times
before; now, he gets one more
shot. They do have two quality
closers with Todd Worrell
returning from injury to join Lee
Smith, but this team won’t have
enough leads for one closer to
protect, much less two.
