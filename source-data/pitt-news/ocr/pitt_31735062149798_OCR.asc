‘Orphaned’ Lithuanian
Classroom Dedicated

Minister Says U.S.
Is Key to Freedom

By Edgar Beigel

In the Commons Room last
Friday night a diplomat without
a‘ country dedicated another of
the University’s? “orphaned”
nationality rooms, while hun-
dreds of his compatriots sang
“Lithuania Our Fatherland.”

i As His Excellency, Colonel
Povilas Zadeikis, Minister of the
Republic of Lithuania to the United
States, oﬁered the Lithuanian na-
tionality room to the University, he
painted a background of political
and social persecution, resistance,
rebellion, and subjugation. The
liquidation of the independence of
Lithuania by Soviet Russia last
July 21 is accepted as another epi-
sode in a continued story of al-
ternate Polonization and Russiﬁca-
tion of this chunk of map half the
size of Pennsylvania.

Although in reality Lithuania
“voted” to become one of the Soviet
Socialist Republics last July, the
country is still independent on the
official diplomatic map of the world.
Colonel Zadeiki.s revealed exclu-
sively to the News that he will
“continue in this country as if noth-
ing happened. We will just hold
on, and await the outcome of events
in Europe. In a nutshell, we can
do nothing.”

‘But the Minister intimated that
the status of Lithuania would be
determined by the United States
rather than by Lithuanians. Like
Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and
France, Lithuania leans heavily on
American non-recognition of sub-
jugated countries. On July 23 -the
State department properly: de-
nounced the “deliberate annihila-
tion” of the Baltic countries by
Soviet Russia.

In his public address, -Colonel
Zadeikis explained, “It seems as
through providence deemed that

Lithuanians.-should once more .un- V

dergo the pain of supreme sacriﬁce
so that the spirit of resistance and
endeavor would be preserved from
rust. Last summer Lithuania was
invaded and her independence
eclipsed by the strategy of the
Soviet Union; Lithuania simply was
dragged into the Red experiment,
which is revolting to the spirit of
the Lithuanian nation devoted to
religion, freedom and ways of the
Western culture.”

The Lithuanian classroom “is a
true expression of the spirit of ‘free
American‘ Lithuanians in general,
especially in face of the grave mis-
fortune which befell the land of
their forefathers. It is at the same
time a true -reflection of the feelings
of the entire Lithuanian nation and
its « government now ‘temporarily
under duress,” he said.

Formerly minister of national de-
‘fense, and a member of numerous
‘military commissions in negotiations
‘with France, Germany, and Bus-
sia, before he became minister to
the United States in 1935, ‘Colonel
Zadeikis privately, revealed that the
fifth column “was not absent-in.-the
subjugation of Lithuania. These
new methods of aggression are suc-
cessful today without actual mili-
tary hostilities.” This new Rus-
-siﬁcation of Lithuania is ironic in
=».vie,w of the fact that 37 per cent of
<al1=TLit‘huanian voters supported the
German party in the last election.

Conscription Day
Causes University

ToCaneel Classes

At a meeting of the deans of the
various schools of the University
held lastweek, the following mo-
tion was adopted.

“To enable : all male students
and faculty members .within the
age range of 21 to 35 years of
age to; comply with the registra-
tion provisions of the Federal Se-
lective Training and Service act
of 1940, no classes, day or eve-A
ning, will be held after 12:30
o’clock on Wednesday, October
.16?!

The committee of deans said
that it is understood that students
and faculty members may regis-
ter at the nearest polling D1308
and that they do not have to reg-
ister in home polling places. The
University "will secure a list of
registration places in the district
and publish them and place them
on bulletin boards for the .con-
venience of those affected. The
Pitt News will publish this list
as soon as it is available.

Consumers Get

Coed Designs

University . women interested in
designing clothes costume jewelry,
or aaccessories will have a ready
market waiting for them this fall. V

Following the swing to Ameri-
can-designed clothes, -the Campus
Originals’ Guild of New York is
working hand in hand with colleges
throughout the country. A plan is
being sponsored whereby clothes
and accessories designed by students
will have a ready market with man-
ufacturers. who ‘are members of the
Guild, and who will pay college
women for original designs. A

All designs accepted will be man-T

ufactured and sold in leading de-
partment stores throughout the
country, accompanied by the Guild
tag.

The tag will bear the ‘name, year,
and school of the student-designer.
Checks for amounts of $10 to $25
will be sent in payment for accept-
ed designs.

In addition the designer will re-
ceive nationwide publicity in news-
papers and magazines through the
Guild’s promotion of her design.

As a ﬁnal honor, she will be pre-
sented with a certiﬁcate.

' Anyone interested in the plan
should address inquiries in care‘ of
the Pitt News. 3 i

Errors in Customs Exams.
Put Frosh Behind Eight-Bull

The Cathedral of Learning stands
on its arches, according to one con-
scientious freshman woman who
took the customs examination given
Wednesday and Thursday.

One freshman wrote in answer
to the question “What is the signi-
ﬁcance of the Commons Room?”
“It is a place where you go to en-
joy the inspiring arches. This is
all Pitt stands for”. Other signiﬁ-
cances which the Commons Room
acquired were “a place for conver-
sational as well as leisure times”
and “a place where everyone is
common.”

The customs examination also
brought about drastic changes in the
University personnel with Mrs. Ed-
na Batz, secretary of the YWCA,
becoming student president of the
WAA and Miss Helen Pool Rush,
assistant to the dean of women, as-
suming the job of dean of the Col-
lege.

Even the honored alumni suffered
in the shake-up which it was writ-
ten that the “Weird sisters” were
the ﬁrst graduates of the College
and various females ranging from
“Strawberries to Cowberries” grad-
uated from the School of Medicine.

Owl Salesmen
Begin Campus

Drive Today

Loeb Announces 85

Seniors in Campaign

Subscriptions for the 1941 Owl,
featuring “You,” will be, on sale
for the ﬁrst time today, as the
senior subscription drive gets
«underway.

According to Selwyn Loeb,
BA41, business manager, this year’s
Owl, in emphasizing individuality,
is attempting “something heretofore
untried in any school’s yearbook
style.” '

The ﬂy leaf of the book will carry
out the individuality idea with a
cover-all pattern, using the ﬁrst
name of every senior. In the open-
ing section of the book, each senior
will ﬁnd a large individual portrait
of himself. ‘

Eighty-ﬁve seniors have been ap-
pointed salesmen. To purchase a
book, seniors should contact any of
the following:

Evelyn Green, Esther Glick, Dor-
othy Ornitz, Louise Smith, Betty
Toddie, Virginia Childress, Betty
Brunk, Harriet Glasser, Kitty
Koontz.

VVednesday evening time limit
is 11:30 o’clock and on Thurs-
day evening there is no restric-
tion. Corley‘ asks, however, that
fraternities do not take advantage
of freshmen and entertain “too far
into the night.”

According to Corley, the new
time limit, which is the ﬁrst ruling
of its kind in the history of Pitt
fraternities, is imposed to permit
fraternity members and rushees to
spend more time on their studies-
time that is free from the tempta-
tion of fraternity social invitations.

Rushing period will end at 2
o’clock Sunday morning when si-
lence period, during which no new
student may be approached on fra-
ternity matters by fraternity men,
begins. Phi Epsilon Pi, Sigma Alpha
Mu, and Pi Lambda Phi end their
rushing period at 2 o’clock Friday
morning because of Jewish holi-
days.

dance this afternoon and a smoker

tarium features tomorrow’s pro-
gram.

tertainment.

reclining in the basement of the
University along with an assort-
ment of pipe.

Lingnan Sends
Trustee Head
To University

Wannamaker Talks
On War-Torn China

A voice from university stu-
dents in war-torn China will
come to the University tomor-
row when Olin D. Wannamaker,
director of the board of trustees
of Lingnan university, China,
speaks to the University in 1217
Cathedral at 3:30 o’clock.

Lingnan university, long been in-
cluded in the University’s Chinese
educational program, has exchanged
students with Pitt from time to

time, and now exchanges newspa-
pers.

Mr. Wannamaker is in the midst
of a nationwide tour and is eager
to visit the University. The in-
formal tea and round-table dis-
cussion given in his honor tomor-
row afternoon will be sponsored by
the ofﬁces of the dean of men and
the dean of women.

Student Body Invited

Miss Helen Poole Rush, assistant
dean of women, explains that al-
though enough invitations have
been mailedto .a group of students
to insure a large audience for the
Chinese educator, the entire stu-
dent body is invited to both the
tea and the ensuing discussion.

Early this summer, the News re-
ceived a copy of a special edition
of the Lingnan Weekly. Ng Wing
Chiu, editor of the paper, explained

its purpose in the. following state-

ment:
Appreciation Expressed

“Friends of Lingnan in China and
abroad have played an important
role in helping it overcome various
difficulties encountered during re-
cent years, and in view of this, the
student body takes this opportu-
nity to express its appreciation
through the Lingnan Weekly, at the
same time attempting to acquaint
them with the actual situation of
he university—-the problems con-
fronting it, and the results achieved
to date. We hope that they will
still continue to contribute their
valued assistance to perpetuate its
existence.”

The paper told of the university’s
exile from Canton to Hong Kong,
movements to aid Wounded soldiers,
picnics on the students’ launch in
the harbor, and the “red andgrey’s”
consistently victorious soccer team.
One lengthy story on Lingnan coeds
showed a deﬁnite Parisian inﬂu-
ence when it ended with “vive la
femmes.”

Palpatating Paragraph ofthe Week: " --

This is a story about Peggy Smith. Peggy is, a
lovely girl. So lovely, in fact, that the Kappa Sig
boys chose her as the. date for their adonis: from out

- 3 of the‘ west, Paul Christman, currently associated,-. with

that thing that took place in the Sadium Saurday
afternoon. A. But Friday afternoon; Peggy ‘was _a.
worried little gal. The grapevine says that she wasn’t
carrying" furrows in her forehead ‘because she was
afraid of what Paul Drisch would say, for you see,
the Pittsburgher doesn’t star in her league anymore.
The thing" bothering her was whether ,Cl1rist_man

brothers had arranged for him. We don’t know how
the Kappa Sig plans turned out, but Peggy knows the

course in two years. = ' A . -  -

Inasmuch as the German semesters formerly took
only about six months. of the year, with both -sum.
mer and a Winter vacation, this is not as great a hard-
ship as may be imagined. ‘‘This.. represents .a. .c_on..
siderable saving in time,” the German‘ Library re.
ports, “but at the same time a correspondingly greater
demand is made on the student, since the stanadrd of
knowledge must not under any circumstances be
lowered.” ‘ ' '

The change in German high schools due to the war
is not as great as may be anticipated because the en-
ti.re German school ‘system was reorganized -in 1938.
The change had resulted in a nationallyunited school
organization. The trimester change is the major dif-
ference in universities. .

Curricula in both high schools and universities have
not been changed, but there is much greater emphasis
on historical and p_.olitical- subjects. Sports and air
raid precaution instructions have also been pushed to
the front-..  .

Panthers Stop Final Quarter
Pass Onslaught to Win, 19-l3

By Ben Foote

All-American Paul Christman
threw a scare into 26,000 Pitt
fans late Saturday afternoon
with two sensational passing
drives, but the Whistle blew with
the Panth.ers in possession of a
precious 19-13 lead over Missouri
up at the Stadium.

With less than four minutes re-
maining to play, the shock-haired
passing wonder unlimbered his fa-
mous pitching arm to pace a rapid’
85-yard touchdown aerial offensive. _
personally attending to the scoring
of the sixpointer with a dive
through the center of the line. Then
on the next kick-off, .the astute
Christman called for a short kick,
that surprised the Bowser-coached
eleven no end.

Ray Schultz, beefy Tiger guard,‘
fell on the free ball and gave Don
Faurot’s boys possession again with
45 seconds left on the time clock.
However, Christman missedon two
successive slings andthe game end-
ed when Ted Konetsky, Joe Ret-
tinger, and Stan Gervelis converg-
ed on Passin’ Paul 20 yards behind
the line of scrimmage.

Panther tallies came at the end of
drives of 58, 80 and 62 yards. and
nary a pass play accounted for gain
in these powerful onslaughts pro-
pelled by George Kracum, Bob
Thurbon, and Edgar Jones.

Whenever the game Pitt men
lacked inches or feet of a ﬁrst down,
Kracum cracked the line for the
necessary yardage, and it was he
who went over from the two—yard
line for the ﬁrst tal.ly. Wide-
awake Eddie Jones then picked up
Mike Sekela’s bocked conversion
attempt and skirted the end for the
extra- point. p "

In the second stanza, skitterbug
Harry Ice, 165—pound understudy
to Christman, momentarily. stole
the spotlight from-.hi—s more illus-
trious predecessor, and placed the
lVIissQ_urians deep in“ Pitt territory.
Then after an exchangeof punts,
the all-American Christman return-

ed to,to,ss-‘~sorne,passes,.,the ﬁnal one.’ v

when Edgar, star kicker, showed up
at the Park. On September 27, four
days before the opening game with
Geneva, a spirited group of’ ath-

unanimously voted “Aye” for like-
able Joe Thompson as captain, the
same Joe Thompson who tutored an

Several Boys Prove
Outstanding in Drills

Under the direction of coach Har-
old Klein, formerly known as 1-eit
guard Butch, Pitt’s freshman foot-
ball squad got its first dose of var-

sity attack last week.

Klein was in charge while Nick
Kliskey explained the Missouri sys-
tem to Pitt’s “milk squad.” In a
long defensive drill against‘ the
Panther regulars, the freshmen, as
Kliskey put it, “looked like Fresh-
men.”

That the frosh play would be
ragged in spots was quite natural,
and the Panther yearling bosses are
pleased over the good form dis-
played by certain performers whose
ha-rd charging -play made the var-
sity work for its gains. 0
Clawes Shows Well ' . .

Coach Klein, having celebrated-
his promotion from undergraduate
work by arriving at the Stadium in
a snappy new suit, sent about 25 of
his charges into the varsity melee.‘
Several of the boys showed ﬂashes
of brilliance. ’  _

A converted tacks, Shadyside’s
Jim Clawes, backed up the line in
Kliskey style and may provide a
deﬁnite answer to the fear that fu-
ture Pitt teams will be weak at
center. From. Thayer Academy in
Massachusetts comes Marsh Mor-
gan, a guard who led his school to
the New" England prep school title.

Frank Scatton’ of I-Iazleton is out-
standing in the quarterback - slot.

What’s_the use of being a quick-thinker if your -
pen won't work when your brain does? . V

A college professor found that this gets many a
student down. -So he invented a brand-new way of
ﬁlling pens-an way that makes more room for ink
INSIDE by dispensing with the customary rubber ,

ink sac.

_ Parker spent 5 years to engineer this revolu-
tionary principle to perfection-this sacless “One-
Hand” F iller—the Parker Vacumatic-the largest

selling pen in the world today.

A pen that holds nearly twice as much ink as our
old style, and shows days ahead if it’s running low-,
so it won’t run dry.‘ Whose lubricated 14 K Gold
Point.-—non-brittle, extra resilient—is tipped with
Osmiridium so smooth and hard and dense that..it
won’t wear scratchy as long as you live! - '

And its crowning glory is that streamlined Pearl
and Jet style — laminated, Ring upon. Ring, as
shimmeringlas vel_vet—-wholly smart, original and
exclusive--winner‘ of the Pen Beauty contest.

Go and see it and try it—don’t make the mistake
of writing “the hard way” throughout your college

course and life’s career.

Survey of American Painting
Replaces international Exhibit

Paintings collected from galleries,
private collections, public buildings,
and artists studios all over the
country will be shown at the Sur-
vey of American Paintings which
will open Thursday, October 24, at
Carnegie Institute.

The exhibit will take the place of
the annual International, which the
Institute has suspended because of
the European conflict.

The show is expected to be one
of the most comprehensive surveys
of American painting ever present-
ed in the country.

Muscles
Poli Scis Will Mix

Brain with ‘Brawn’

Shouting their blood-tingling
battle cry “To do or die for dear
old Poli Sci,” the brilliant intel-
lects of the political science depart-
ment met Friday to form the ath-
letic teams that will soon sweep
the playing ﬁelds of Pitt.

The hitherto cloistered minds
decided that when the Spartans
quipped “a sound mind in a sound
body” they really gave birth to
an idea.

As the ﬁrst step in the campaign
for athletic accomplishment, the
future statesmen, in the best par-
liamentary manner, formed teams
to compete in the quite democratic
sports of touch football, tennis, and
horseshoes. Since all political or-
ganizations must have a leader,
Hiram Milton, C42, after a master-
ly campaign, was elected to be
manager of all teams.

Transfers To Meet

Activity Leaders
At Fireside Chat

Women transfers will have an op-
portunity to meet both men and
women activity leaders at a WSGA
“ﬁreside chat” Wednesday at 12:30
o’clock on the twelfth ﬂoor. Rep-
resentatives from every organiza-
tion on campus will be on hand to
address the group and answer ques-
tions, announces Betty Sapp, C42,
chairman of the transfer commit-
tee. V

A talk by Miss Helen Pool Rush,
assistant dean of women, will open
the assembly.

Two distinct sections will make
up the show: the retrospective and
the contemporary. The retrospec-
tive will include work of artists
from the works of colonial period
to about 1920, and the contempor-
ary will include significant living
artists from 1920.

Pittsburgh artists represented in
the show will be Everett Warner,
Samuel Rosenberg, Clarence Car-
ter, Johanna Haleman, Malcolm Par-
cell, and Virginia Cuthbert Elliott,
wife of Philip C. Elliott, assistant
professor of ﬁne arts.

Rifles to Accept
New Candidates

Richard. Frankovitch, captain and
president of Pitt Riﬂes, honorary
military fraternity, announces that
Pitt Riﬂes will accept candidates
this week. Results so far hint that
the prospective enrollment will ex-
ceed last year’s total of 140.

Preliminary instructions and drill
are being given at Bubbles ﬁeld the
fifth hour on Monday and Wednes-
day. Plans are under way for the
annual Pitt Riﬂes parade scheduled
for one of the major football games
in the near future.

Pound Closes
Attack on Law
Administration

By William L. Klinkenstein

Warning the members of the bar
that they must “stay the march to-
ward administrative absolutism” by
simplifying judicial review, Dr.
Roscoe Pound, former dean of the
Harvard Law school, delivered the
third of his lectures on administra-
tive law in Foster Memorial audi-
torium Friday.

Dean Pound declared that admin-
istrative rules and administrative
decisions are often made without
observing any of the checks and
balances which accompany the rule
and decision-making powers of the
courts and the legislature. In his
plea for judicial review of admin-
istrative acts, he gave four tenden-
cies of administrators which sub-
stantiate his theory. They are:

1. The tendency of administra-
tors to act without a hearing or
without hearing both sides of the
case. “The books are full of cases
where the administrative commis-
sion did not hold a hearing,” Dean
Pound stated. “More frequent is
the fact that the agency hears only
one side.”

2. The tendency to act on mat-
ters that are not before the admin-
istrative tribunal. He cited cases
where administrators based their
decisions on their own experience,
claiming that they did not have to
take evidence because of long ex-
perience.

3. The tendency to make deter-
rninations on the basis of pre-
formed decisions. Dean Pound said
that the hearings held in these cases
are of no importance, for the ad-
ministrator is merely building up a
set of “water—tight” records in case
there is a-court ﬁght.

4. The tendency of administra-
tive agents to delegate their power
of review over cases already decided
by the commission to deputies.
Dean Pound charged that the depu-
ties are likely to be prejudiced in
the case because the case was proba-
bly ﬁrst tried by colleagues of the
appellate administrator.

While declaring that there is a
deﬁnite need for judicial review of
the decisions of administrative
tribunals, Dean Pound admitted the
difficulty of appealing to the regu-
lar courts. He declared that the

methods of review in the courts are
dilatory and expensive and sug-
gested that a technique of review
be devised.
