Artistic Side Show

Arts Department

By ROBERT BROWN

As a sort of artistic side show
to the current Carnegie Inter-
national exhibition, the Fine
Arts department of the Univer-
sity is presenting a compara-
tively Lilliputian show of its
own.

Reproductions of works by

contemporary artists whose
paintings are entered in the In-

ternational are hung in the seventh

floor galleries of the department,
and you will find everything from
the planned designs of Henri
Matisse to the futuristic take-offs
of Marc Chagall.

Veteran Pablo Picasso, the
‘Spaniard who has started so many
schools of painting that he has
lost track of them himself, is best
represented by three of his works.
When you study a few of his pic-

tures at a time you are impressed

with the inan’s manifold genius,
but look at a book of reproduc-
tions of his works and you realize
that even the great Picasso cannot
hit such a high level of produc-
tion that a masterpiece emerges
from his studio every week.

Picasso Shows Genius

An artist who is not credited
with being such a genius as Picas-
so but who has turned out a steady
stream of good painting for the
past twenty years is Henri Matis-
se, who hit the New York Armory
show in 1913. He has dabbled a
little in everything, but always re-
turns to the delicate color and
sensitive line that characterizes
his work.

He puts his red and green
splotches just where they will
balance encloses them with a
fluent line, and the result is a
sensitive rendering of the nude
female form that is as impressive
as anything in modern art. He fol-
lows in the footsteps of Botticelli,
the gentle dreamer of the Floren-
tine Renaissance, and Ingres, the
last great warhorse ofclassicism.

Matisse, who is represented by
two of his best works in the cur-
rent show, studied in the same
studio as Andre Derain, who has
two landscapes hung.-

The “Balance ‘ “Wheel”

Derain represents all that is
healthy and fine in present day
art; he is the “balance wheel” of
the modern movement. Early in
life he turned his back on Cubism
and its allied schools, character-
ized them as “pure humbug.” He

-paints in soft browns and greens,

and drives his 12-cylinder car at
high speed on Paris roads.

There is no space left for the
other painters in the show, except
for a passing mention of them.
Maurice de Vlaminck, who taught
himself how to play the violin
and paint, is represented by a
large landscape of “Auvers;”
George Braque, whose prize win-
ner at the International makes old
ladies gasp and truck drivers

-swear, has a similar abstraction on

exhibit; and works by Chagall,
Marie Laurencin, Rockwell Kent,
and others just as famous are also
featured.

You will not enjoy all of the
paintings, but the art critics only
ask you to be tolerant. They tell
the story of the nice young lady
who silently ‘commented ' on one
of Raoul Dufy’s paintings by a
convulsive shudder, although she
was unaware of the fact that he
designed the particular style of
dress she was wearing.

At any rate the exhibit will con-
tinue until October 28.

 

Physics Group
Plans Chapter
Of Honorary

Formation of a local chapter of
Sigma Pi Sigma, national honor-
ary physics fraternity is being
planned through the efforts of
Robert Pelton, EE38; James Mil-
ler, C39; David Halliday, EE38;
and Don Trexel, E38.

To launch their program, the
organization committee is asking
a member of the Executive Coun-
cil of SPS to deliver a talk here
in the near future.

The aim of the fraternity, ac-
cording to Pelton, is “to humanize
physics and to recognize high
scholastic work among physics
students.” Admission to the chap-
ter will be determined by scholas-
tic rating, interest in theoretical
physics, and the activities of the
student.

With the institution of the chap-
ter will be formed a placement
bureau for graduates of the de-
partment.

Any student interested in the
formation and organization of the
local chapter should see the mem-
bers of the committee.

Panthers

Wisconsin
Badgers Play
At Stadium

Tomorrow

Playing its ﬁfth game of the
season, the tied, but unbeaten

Panthers, will meet the ﬁfth
team that has been undefeated
before its Pitt game when
Harry Stuhldreher comes out of
the golden West with his Wiscon-
sin football Lochinvars to battle
Pitt in the Stadium tomorrow af-
ternoon.

The Panthers will be playing
' their eighth, game with a Big Ten
Conference foe tomorrow and will
be attempting to get a victory
edge. As their record against
Conference opponents now stands,
everything is even. Pitt has won
three, lost three, and tied one in
this sort of competition.

One of the standards by which
the Big Ten has been able to
maintain its air of football super-
iority, has been its ability to de-
feat outside opponents. Motivated
by this desire, and an even strong-
er urge to pin back the Rose Bowl
champions, Wisconsin will be out
to win tomorrow with every wea-
pon that the crafty Harry Stuhl-
dreher has armed them with.

And the Big Ten has sent one
of its worthiest sons out to keep
the family shield unmarked. The
Badgers, with impressive tri-
umphs over Chicago and Iowa are
now heading the Conference list.
They are tied with Minnesota and
Northwestern.

Surrounding the Badgers as
they come down out of those Wis-
consin woods is that same omni-
mous cloud of secrecy that was
hushed about a Conference broth-
er a few years back when he came
down to the Stadium to tangle
with the Panthers. .

Cheering Block

Non-Regimentation
Policy W7 ill Become
Effective Tomorrow

No more regimentation for
cheering block members is the
new policy of the co-chairmen,
D. C. Schultz, BA38, and William
McKenna, BA39.

This policy was announced in
time to be effective for the game
tomorrow, and means, among
other things, no more mid-week
rehearsals. All members need to
do now is come to the game a
half-hour early and sit anywhere
in the vicinity of the section lead-
er with their friends.

Members will carry out the
commands as the cheerleader gives
them. “This makes it easy,”
Schultz said, “for any student to
be a member even if he cannot
come to a rehearsal during the
week.” Schultz mentioned, too,
that the cheering block has the
best seats in the student section.

Stunts to be shown tomorrow,
without rehearsal, include form-
ing of a large “W,” and an “A”
for the alumni. The standard;
“P” and the revolving “P”. will be
shown. A, large “P-I-T-T” will
complete the letters formed. An-

other stunt planned for the day is

to form a crouching panther.
Students who have signed up
since the Duquesne game may get
their equipment today after 1
o’clock in thedemonstration block
headquarters, 801 Cathedral.

TO DISCUSS ‘CLOTH’

Students and faculty members
are invited to attend and join in
the discussion. According to Mr.
Elliott, his talk will center largely
with the relationship between
contemporary painting and the
public opinion.

Cubist Braque’s “The Yellow
Cloth,” International first prize
winner, subject of critical burles-
que and public disapproval, will
be considered in the analysis, to-
gether with various works selected
from the 403 canvasses on exhi-
bition.

ACADEMIC OPINION

Besides presenting his personal
favorites, Mr. Elliott will discuss
the various schools of painting,
the background of the prize win-
ners, and the relation of academic
study to the works exhibited.

In order to allow time for stu-
dents to purchase their lunches,
the meeting has been resched-

uled from 12:45 to 1, and will last
until 2 o’clock.

The 3’ear’s program was begun

ONE hundred or more students attended the
YM-YWCA Institute on Municipal Affairs

\Vednesday and did not hear a scheduled de-p

bate by Pittsburgh mayoralty candidates.

debate, Robert N. »VVaddell, Republican candi-
date, took walk out powders, charging a Dem-
ocratic frainc-up. I

;\i;--xyr,~r Cm-nelius D. Scully wa_s requested, in
no lll'l('t‘.="l‘2ll‘.1 zerms, not to appear in order to
avoicl "any implication that the Association
(The Y) was more favorable to one party than
to another. The central purposewould have
been defeated through the absence of one can-
didate.” _

All of which is well and good, above board
and strictly non-partisan.

Despite the fact that the appearance of
Mayor Scully alone would seem to give the
meeting a partisan basis, the charge of par-

tisanship already had been drummed up the

day before, and the idea will linger, especially
in the minds of Republicans.

Furthermore, since the invitation had been
extended to both parties, the logical action
would have been to let Mayor Scully fulﬁll his
engagement at the Institute.

One hundred students attended the meet-
ing to hear of the local political situation di-
rectly from the leading candidates involved——
and to enjoy a. social hour.

They had a swell time playing games.

Dr. Williams Analyzes
Campus Fraternities
By Dr. Samuel H. Williams

During the next few days, many members of the
freshman class will be giving serious consideration
to the matter of fraternity membership. Many will
be trying to ﬁnd the answer to the question, “Shall
I join a fraternity if I have the opportunity?”

Others will be trying to ﬁnd, the answer to the.

question, “What fraternity shall I join?”

In some Universities, fraternities are regarded by
the University administration with thinly-veiled
hospitality, others with indifference. At Pittsburgh
we believe the fraternity has a valuable service to
render in stimulating its members and giving prac-
tical assistance in fulﬁlling best the purpose for
which they have "come to college.

Main tains S tandards

From this point of view the fraternity which
maintains standards of scholarship and ethics, and
insists upon their observance is strengthening the
hand of the University itself in helping the indi-
vidual student achieve the utmost of which he is
capable.

Yet no one can answer these two ‘questions with-

out serious thought. Not every man, for instance,
should join a fraternity. Ordinarily, a fraternity is
a group of men of congenial tastes and similar ideas
of conduct who live together in comfortable sur-
roundings and enjoy the inspiration which that
kind of fellowship affords.

Unless a student who is considering -joining a fra-
ternity feels that in addition to proﬁting from such
a fellowship, he can contribute to it, he should not
join a fraternity. The strength of a fraternity de-

velope upon the aggressiveness with which each_

member maintains the ideals for which it stands.

Must Assume Responsibility

The student contemplating joining a fraternity
should think of it not only from the point of View
of the beneﬁts he will derive but from the point
of view of the responsibility he will assume.

It is equally true that a man who fails to join a
fraternity when such standards as these prevail
loses one of his greatest opportunities at college.
Each student’s main purpose lies, or should lie,
within the curriculum. Everything else is second-
ary to that main purpose, and should be made to
serve it. If a man is wise enough to choose a fra-
ternity which is proud of its standards and jealous
of its scholarship, his membership in the fraternity
will make it easier for him to fulﬁll this main pur-
pose.

Important as this aspect of the matter is, there
are other beneﬁts which a man derives from join-
ing a fraternity of this type. The value he will
receive in cultural developments and social pres-
ence and in stimulating fellowship are values which
cannot be over estimated. Furthermore, he will
develop a personal friendship which will last as
long as he lives and which will be of value to him
not only in college but after he graduates in bus-
iness, as well as in socialvlife.

Ta1lulah’s Siren

False Alarm
By ¢7VIarion Conn

The current Shakespearian revival, which has
.characterized the present and past seasons in the
theater, hits an unfortunate snag in Tallulah Bank-
head’s version of Antony and Cleopatra.

If it is possible for a dramatic production to have
form unblessed by presence of spirit, the Laur-
ence Rivers adaptation of the Elizabethan bard’s
work has just that. As the layman looks upon a
Praxitilean statute and sees only so many hundred-
weight of calcium carbonate, so the average thea-
ter-goer looks upon this production of Antony and
Cleopatra and sees only the beauty of setting and
costuming.

In View of Miss Bankhead’s innate ability to
play the siren in drawing—room dramas, one might
think she would make the ideal Cleopatra. She is
tortuous enough, ardent enough, but she lacks the
ability to put her lines across to the audience. The
result is that the poetry is lost in the scuffle.

Miss Bankhead’s supporting players are no more
capable than herself. Given to bellowing and fan-
ning the air, most of the male members of the cast
become over—dramatic and inarticulate.

of her inarticulation. John Emory’s Caesar is un-
doubtedly the best portrayal of the lot, although
his superior enunciaition is useless against the
mumbling of the other players.

Compared with other recent excursions into
Shakespearian drama, the mediocrity of this pro-

. duction becomes all the more apparent. Katherine
'Cornell’s Romeo and Juliet is incomparable. The

Theater Guild’s Taming of the Shrew, starring the
Lunts, is at least vigorous. Morris Evans’ timely
Richard II, which had a three—year run on Broad-

« way, is sparkling.

Of course, the play has its brilliant spots. When
the messenger from Rome brings to Cleopatra the
news of An_tony’s "marriage to Octavia, and Cleo-
patra questions him concerning Octavia, the audi-
ence relaxes before the ﬁrst demonstration of the
Shakespearian style. Through the pathetic fumb-
lings of the actors, one even discerns glimmering
of the board’s poetry.

Brilliant In Spots

There is only one other scene in the play that
is commendable. On an almost darkened stage,
lighted intermittently with ﬂashes of artillery and
with oif—stage rumblings from the battleﬁeld, one
forgets to listen to the speeches ‘of the actors but is
held by the perfection of stage properties.

Designed by J o Mielzner, this perfection of prop-
erties and costumes is the play’s one anchor to

windward, supplemented by William Strunk’s poor

adaptation and Virgil Thomson’s music which
might conveniently be forgotten. A

Perhaps with more rehearsal under more dis-
criminating direction, the Rivers presentaton of
Antony and Cleopatra might be made into a dra-
matic endeavor ranking with Richard II. Until
then, Tallulah Bankhead and her company should
stick to drawing-room drama.

Point . . .

 

It has come to my attention that two individuals -(whose
names are withheld because of their age) are trying to’ get
away with the ofﬁce of mayor of Pittsburgh.

So clever have been these two that they have thus far es-
caped being cornercd. This success official circles attribute

to an uncanny ability to dash up¢

a dark alley at the slightest un-
usual sound.

Little of their description has
been discovered except that they
both are friends of the working
man; both favor the city manager
plan (which will eventually be
their undoing); both have pro-
mised to go straight; and that they
are men of action and keepers of
promises.

The only possible clue to work
on is a statement let slip by one
man (Whom the authorities be-
lieve to be a Republican) as he
snuk past the Oakland YMCA
He wzis overheard
making the remark that the YMCA
breeds Democrats. (I personally
think this won’t help much; in
fact, I think this is a vile slur
against the manhood of the
YMCA).

thorities are searching all possible

Hagan Blasts
Schedule Of Ice
League In Paper

By AL IVIALAKOFF

The News has not been
scooped!

The story that appeared in
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on
VVednesday morning emanated
from sources outside the Uni-
versity, and contained state-
ments which the University
athletic heads knew nothing of
until they saw them in the pa-
per.

First, the University has not
authorized the formation of a
hockey team, to play in a league
of Pittsburgh and Cleveland uni-
versities and colleges, as was
stated by the Post-Gazette.

Secondly, the University will
form sucha team when student
opinion is behind it, and facilities
are favorable.

MISUNDERSTANDING

Sometime ago, Jimmy Hagan,
athletic director of the University,
was invited to attend a meeting
by John Harris, local promoter.
The purpose of the meeting was

to discuss plans wth the other

Pittsburgh schools to form a

hockey organization.

Director Hagan, out of town for
the Fordham game, was unable to
attend the meeting and wrote
Harris to that effect. Somehow or
other, a misunderstanding existed,
and a schedule was made up, with-
out consuflﬂing the Pitt repres-
entatives. As a. matter of fact,
Hagan never heard any more of
the idea until he picked up the
morning paper and saw that Pitt
was listed in the league.

SCHOOLS SCHEDULED

The teams of the league are
grouped around Pittsburgh, as one
group, and around the colleges
around Cleveland forming the
other group. They are supposed to
be aided by the Pittsburgh Pirate
professional hockey team and the
Cleveland professional team
through offers of the use of their
‘inks.

Each team plays two games
with each of the opponents, in
double headers at the local school’s
arena, under collegiate rules.
Freshmen are allowed to play on
the varsity. Case, Baldwin-Wal-
lace, Western Reserve, John Car-
roll, Akron, Duquesne, Carnegie
Tech, and Pitt are supposed to
compose the league.

But Pitt hasn’t sanctioned such
a thing. Nothing was asked of Pitt
when games were to be sched-
uled, how and where and when
practice was to be had, or what
standing the sport was to have
with the school.

Last year, the city colleges had
semi-official teams as tests for
student opinion. These teams were
not supported by the institutions,
but they were composed of stu-
dents of only a single school’.
Nothing more was done about
Pitt’s team.

STUDENT OPINION WANTED

Jimmy Hagan pointed out that
he and the athletic council wanted
to get as many students playing
in as many different sports as
they cared to. He wants to hear
from students who would like to
play or see collegiate, that is, Pitt
hockey. But he was just as definite
in saying that the University
would not walk into any sport
blindly.

If the students want it, the
University will have it. There are
the facilities to consider too. Last
year it was necessary for the team
members to practice at six in the
morning. Business arrangements
must be made so that the Pitt
players can practice and play at
reasonable times. When student
support, and good facilities can
be had, then only, will the Um-
versity play hockey.

JAMES A. HAGAN

WHO, AS ATHLETIC DIREC-
TOR, denied all official Univer-
sity sanction of ,’the ‘Intercol-
legiate Hockey League. The
schedule for this league, which
included Pitt among the mem-
bers, was released in the down-
town papers earlier this week.
At the same time Hagan ex-
pressed his approval of the sport
for Pitt, if handled in the proper
manner.

Novices
Win
Laurels

Ammerman,
Sulkowski
Stand Out

With a cold winter wind sweep-
ing across the Stadium cinderpath,
the sixth annual Novice Track and
Field Meet got under way Wed-
nesday afternoon.

The laurels were well divided
among the entrants in the various
events with only Ed Ammerman
and Bob Sulkowski taking first
place in more than one event.
Ammerman won both the mile
and the two-mile event while Sul-
kowski took ﬁrst place honors in
the 20-yard low hurdles and the
javelin throw in which he made a
heave of 150 feet four inches.

In the other events Standish
took ﬁrst with a time of ten and
ﬁve-tenths second. Newman won
the high hurdles with a time of
sixteen and ﬁve-tenths seconds,
Boulanger the 880-yard dash,

McDowell the high jump.

Although McDowell won ﬁrst
place in the high jump his win-
ning jump of ﬁve feet eight inch-
es was disappointing when taking
into consideration the fact that he
made a six—foot three jump last
spring in winning the National
High School High Jump Cham-
pionship. However, McDowel1’s
high school record promises great
things and Dave should ﬁnd him-
self going over the six-foot mark
pretty consistently after getting
some intercollegiate competition.

The Sulkowski brothers won
more events between them than
any other two ‘entrants. ’While
Bob took ﬁrst in the low hurdles
and the javelin throw and second
in the high hurdles, Harry placed
second in the javelin throw and
third in the 220 low hurdles and
the high hurdles. ‘

Bob Sulkowski showed very
‘good form in making his winning
javelin toss which was ten feet
further than he had ever tossed
it before. Olson was especially
well pleased with his throw and
is expecting a heave of over one
hundred and seventy feet before

the year is over.

shoes for the season.  

This afternoon they will get aE
chance to appease that hunger;
when they meet the Carnegie Tech '
harriers in Schenley Park at 4:30.

The Tartan meet will be the
fourth of the season for the Pitts.
Earlier in the fall they thoroughly
trounced Purdue, Bethany, and
Wayne University.

All three of these teams were
expected to offer the Panthers
plenty of competition, but they
all turned out to be very much in-
ferior co ivir. Olson’s boys. On pa-
per the Panthers should have lost
to Purdue and Wayne as both of
these teams had a very decided
edge on the Panthers on the side
of experience.

However, the Olsonmen made
up for inexperience by their will
to win. Now that they have gain-
ed experience in running against
Purdue, Bethany, and Wayne this
experience plus their will to win
should make the Panthers a very
tough pack of hill and dalers.

Carl Olson when asked what he
thought the Pitt chances against

harriers

the Tartans were said, “Well,
remember the T e c h boys
are just as familiar with the

Schenley Park course as we are
and don’t forget that they have
two very ﬁne cross-country run-
ners.

“I don’t know what our boys
will do. Zamborski will proba-
bly run a good race, but I don’t
know how well Ben and Casimir
Copec will do. Last week against
Wayne at Detroit they -weren’t up
to snuff. But Bob Cogswell has
been showing great form lately
and don’t be surprised if he is
right up among the winners this
afternoon.”

Al Zamborski, Ben and Casimir
Copec, Bob Cogswell, John Emens,
Bill McKee, Joe Kristufek, and
Phil Follette will probably be
wearing the Panther varsity suits.

Freshman
Srid Team
Plays Lions

Coach Mike Milligan’s freshman
eleven received their ﬁrst and
only lesson in offensive football
Thursday in preparation for their
initial football test with the Lion
frosh at Penn State, Saturday.

Last season the Panther year-
lings unleashed a vicious passing
attack that "sent Cassiano Scamp-
ering over the goal line for two
touchdowns, enough to come out
on top 13-6. But this year Cas-
siano is making touchdowns for
the varsity and the freshmen have

not had time to learn many pass-~ -

ing formations.

The Blue and Gold plebes will
depend on their defensive ability
to hold the Penn State freshmen
and try to capitalize on their op-
ponent’s errors. Though the Pitt
ﬁrst-year men have brought home
victories from State College the
last two years, this year they will
enter the game in the roll of the
underdog. I

The big jinx that the Milligan
roster will have to overcome is
the fact that for the last number
of years they have always drop-
ped the ﬁrst two games. Last
year the Panther Cubs lost to the
Tech Plebes and Kiski before
dumping the Lion plebes in their
third encounter.

The team that will leave for
State College will be chosen Fri-
day evening. Coach Milligan will
not make up the starting lineup
before Saturday.

(Continued from Page 1)
Mr. Clunk left after denying
knowledge of any connection be-
tween Mr. Foster and the Repub-
lican organization.

Scheduled to address the Insti-

 tute on Municipal Affairs despite

Mr. Waddell’s withdrawal, Mr.
Scully did not appear because his
invitation to speak at the affair
was withdrawn late Wednesday
afternoon, according to William
. W. Mendenhall, executive secre-
tary of the Y. M. C. A. Dr. Hovde
4‘ refused to appear, Mr. Mendenhall
address
might be considered as a substi-
 tute for Mr. Scully’s.
é ‘wrss T0 CANCEL’

> “When Mr. Waddell did not

5 wish to participate on the speci-

‘Q ﬁed basis, it seemed wise to can-

.' cel the program rather than to

_‘ have any implication that the As-

3 sociation (the YM-YWCA) was

, more favorable to one party than

i: to another. The central purpose

-. would have been defeated through

3 the absence of one candidate.

‘; Therefore we regretfully cancel-

- led all political discussions. If

 we couldn’t have the discussions

9 on a high plane, we thought it

better not to have them at all,”

‘stated Mr. Mendenhall.

Explaining Mayor Scully’s ab-
 sence from the Institute meeting,

‘Homer “Lefty” Wadsworth, C35,

~ assistant secretary to the Mayor,

1 yesterday said, “Mr. Mendenhall

’ advised Mayor Scully Wednesday

. afternoon that he wished to with-
draw his invitation to the Mayor
to speak at the Institute on Mu-

, nicipal Affairs.”

A Mr. Wadsworth, former presi-
dent of the University YMCA,
was present at the Institute meet-
ing. He did not speak.

DR. HOVDE DECLINES

Dr. Hovde, originally announced
as the speaker at the afternoon
session, said, “I was asked not to
appear in the afternoon, but to
speak in the evening. Because
Mayor Scully was asked not to
speak in the evening, I did not
want to appear as a substitute for

A him.”
Edward Miller, speakers’ di-
 rector for the Republican execu-
~‘tive committee, said yesterday
that he regarded the Institute
meeting as a “dead issue.” He
said that Mr. Clunk had been sent
to the meeting by the campaign
committee for the four judges, not
by him. Mr. Foster, he said, re-
ceived no authorization from his
committee to represent the Re-
publican party at the Institute.
In the statement issued Tues-
day after he declined to speak at
the Institute, Mr. Waddell said,
“I am doing so because I have re-
'ceived no information from them
(the Institute) as to the nature of
I this proposed open forum, nor in
what manner it will be conduct-
ed, nor to what sort ofan interro-
gation from a possible partisan
"audience the candidate might be
subjected.

SPRINGER CHAIRMAN

“I note that on the program a
member of the Democratic May-
or’s cabinet is listed as a principal
speaker. Also I am informed that
one of the chief sponsors of this
Institute is one of the assistant
secretaries to the Mayor, and that
another leader is an ardent Demo-
crat.”

At the meeting Springer said
"that he and Pauline Yatzko, C39,
ico-chairman, had “contacted Mr.
cWadsworth as the intermediary in
obtaining Mayor Scully to speak,
and only in that respect. The Re-
publican charge is false.

“We decided to call off this
evening's meeting,” continued
Springer, “in order to show the
-Republican leaders as well as the
"general public that we aren’t run-
ning a Democratic headquarters
on the first floor of the Cathedral.

“After Mr. Waddell decided not
to attend this meeting, we be-
lieved that in the interest of our
avowed neutrality it would be de-
sirable to have no discussion be-
tween Mayor Scully and the Re-
publican representative. Mr.
Scully and Dr. Hovde were im-
mediately notiﬁed of our decision.
We still hoped to have Dr. Hovde’s
talk, but he justifiably refused to
take part in such a muddled af-
fair,” Springer later explained.

As originally scheduled, Dr.
Hovde was to have spoken Wed-
nesday afternoon at 4 o’clock on
“What Pittsburgh Needs.” Mayor
Scully and Mr. Waddell were to
have spoken at 7 o’clock in a dis-
cussion of campaign issues.

‘University imports Big Cheese

For Wisconsin Club Reunion

Alumni Association Greets Badger Grads
With Heavy Swiss At Homecoming Parties

“Let ’em eat cheese” will be the theme of the homecoming
parties which the Un1vers1t._v’s General Alumni Association is
sponsoring tonight for the alumni of the University of VViscon-

sin.

A 240-pound, 6-ounce cheese has been sent by the VViscon-
sin Alumni Association to Pittsburgh, and it will be out at the
homecoming parties in Hotel Schenley and Foster Memorial

tonight.

This huge cheese was made in:

Monroe, Wis., home of Arch W.
Nance, president of the V‘fiscon-
sin Club of Pittsburgh. One of
the largest ever handled through
the Pittsburgh office of the Am-
erican Railway Express, it is now
in a white pine cask under re-
frigeration in the Hotel Schenley.

It is estimated that there will be
enough cheese to make at least
two sandwiches for everyone at-
tending the homecoming parties.
With the aid of the mathematics
department, Don F. Saunders, act-
ing secretary of the Alumni As-

2,217 holes in this cheese.

Further computation reveals
that if the cheese were dropped
sideways from the top of the Ca-
thedral, it would make a hole in
the lawn six feet deep. Three
hundred fifteen loaves of rye
bread and five pounds of mustard
will be needed to make the cheese
into sandwiches. The Alumni of-
fice reports that no beer accom-
panied the cheese.
