No special treatment of athletes, says administration

By John Temple E

Asst. News Editor

Pitt athletes cause fewer
disciplinary problems than
non—athletes who are stu-
dents and do not receive spe-
cial treatment when they do,
Pitt administrators asserted
yesterday.

In the wake of two recent
felony arrests of Pitt football
player Reuben Brown, stu-
dents questioned Athletic
Director Oval Jaynes’ deci-
sion to reinstate the star
offensive lineman after the
first arrest and dismiss him
only indefinitely after the sec-
ond.

“I’m concerned there is a
double standard for athletes
and other students here at the
university,” one student at
yesterday’s open forum said.
“I feel that if another student
had done this he would have
been kicked out.”

Brown and another Pitt
football player Jermaine
Williams were arrested earlier
this term after city police offi-
cers raided their apartment
and found a large amount of
crack cocaine. The charges
were eventually dropped, but
Brown was arrested again for
aggravated assault two weeks
ago after a fight in which two
police officers were hospital-
ized.

Jaynes said that the cases

had been blown out of pro-
portion because the students
involved were football play-
ers. Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs William
Harmon said that athletes
actually cause fewer prob-
lems than non—athletes.

“Those people who got in
trouble have high visibility,
but there is a higher percent-
age of non—athletes who get
in trouble than athletes who
get in trouble,” Harmon said.

Jaynes and Harmon would
not comment on the future of
Brown as a student or player.

“As with any student, the
proceedings will remain con-
fidential,” said Harmon, who
oversees the Judicial Board.
“He will receive due process,
as is provided for any student
who stands accused of an
activity.”

Jaynes pointed out the
need to separate the two
Brown incidents, but some
students seemed uncon-
vinced.

“Doesn’t the fact that he got
in trouble again show some-
thing about his character?”
one forum participant said.

Jaynes said that Pitt’s ath-
letes are instructed‘ to act as
representatives of Pitt.

“It is not something we are
taking lightly,” he said.

“But we can’t walk around
with our athletes 24 hours a
day.”

eliminate jobs
through layoffs

By Pete Kapustynski
Asst. News Editor

Due to a decision to cut costs by 10
percent, between 100 and 500 jobs at
the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center are going to be eliminated
after the fiscal year begins on July 1.

According to the president of
UPMC, Jeffrey Romoff, the jobs will
be eliminated by attrition or layoffs.

A similar 10 percent cut in spend-
ing last year allowed UPMC to keep
its cost increase at 3.8 percent,
Romoff said.

Romoff said he is concerned about
costs because although UPMC pro-
vides services that cannot be found
elsewhere, it is the most expensive
medical—care facility in the area.

Another change that will occur
with the new fiscal year is that
Montefiore University Hospital will
no longer be a separate corporate
entity. Montefiore’s current indepen-
dent licensure and board will be
eliminated. Romoff said this should
save UPMC between $5 million and
$7 million a year.

Student concern over tuition
increasessparked an hour of student-
administration interaction yesterday.

The Student Government Board
sponsored an open forum, which
brought out top Pitt administrators,
including Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor to answer student questions
face-to-face.

Pitt student Erin Bush asked
O’Connor to explain how he plans to
raise tuition and also receive an
increase in state funding in light of
Governor Robert Casey’s recent pro-
posal to give little or no increase in
state funding alongside high tuition
hikes. '

O’Connor defended his plan, saying
that Casey’s proposal is not yet law
and that state planning may not
account for expenditures like actual
construction or research at Pitt.

“The governor does have a proposi-
tion on board,” O’Connor said. “But
the proposition puts the University of
Pittsburgh in an awkward position.”

Casey’s proposal would keep the
tuition rate below the current rate of
inflation. O’Connor’s plan would raise
tuition 6 percent, twice the current
inflation rate.

“The tuition that would be raised 
would make available the type of

environment the students want,”
O’Connor said.

He added that the proposed state
plan accounts only for undergraduate
students.

“We can educate graduate students
only with our budget request that the
legislature is now studying," he said.

O’Connor was also the focus of
attention for environmental activists
strongly against any Pitt involvement
with the University of Arizona’s Mount
Graham telescope project.

The project, which recently came
under fire for alleged cover—ups and
illegal funding, had opposition from
Pitt students and members of the
Student Environmental Action
Coahuon. ‘

Josh Knauer, SEAC spokesperson,
asked the administration if it had seen
a 42—page report on the Mt. Graham
site,_ which until recently had been
partially withheld from the UA Board
of Regents and the public.

Knauer cited one censored line that
said funding for the project was “pos-
sibly illegal.”

O’Connor responded, “Possibly ille-
gal means it’s possibly legal.”

The chancellor went on to stress
that Pitt has only been looking into
the possibility of becoming involved
in the multimillion dollar telescope
site.

Bicycle riding: serious
injury, or serious fun?

As the weather gets warmer many people

are eager to enjoy outdoor activities. Cycling

is a great activity that provides recreation,
transportation and exercise. There are an
estimated 90 million bicycles in the United
Statm and over 5 million in Pennsylvania.

cer elections for the 1993-94 school year at
its monthly meeting last night.

Steve, Parks of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences will remain as president of GPSA for
his third term. Haley Thompson of the gradu-

The 14 book scholarships awarded to grad-
uate students will be divided by allotting one
to each of the 14 graduate schools, according
to a GPSA proposal. The GPSA suggestion
will be sent to the Office of Financial Aid
which will determine who receives the $300
yearly scholarships by need and merit.

Any future book scholarships presented to
the GPSA will be awarded to students from a
competitive pool where students from any
school can apply, accordingto the GPSA

feel at home with a  
little help from ASO

By Thanita Adams
For The Pitt News

The African Students
Organization (ASO) was for-
mally established on March 4
in response to the growing
needs of African students.

The group, which was
formed to concentrate on
specific African students’
interests, helps students with
practical matters, such as
finding accommodations and
preparing for Pittsburgh’s
winter weather. Coming from
a climate as warm as Africa,
some students come without
adequate clothing, not realiz-
ing how cold it gets here.

ASO also provides students
from Africa with a “social
President
-Sean P. Lewis said. “It is hard
to arrive somewhere new and
feel alienated. It’s nice to
have someone to talk with
who understands you.”

One of ASO’s main goals is
to keep its members in touch
with what is taking place in
Africa culturally, politically
and economically.

Lewis said that Africa does
not get enough media atten-
tion here in the United States
and hopes that the group will
not only keep its members

informed but will also pro-
vide new information about
Africa’s situation.

Group meetings will focus
on how Africa’s conflicts
came into being and how
Africans can solve these
problems themselves, without
outside intervention.

Lewis also said he hopes
that the group will help clear
up some images about
Africans that have been
formed by the iAmerican
media in light of recently
publicized events such as the
war in Somalia. Although he
said that Africa does have
some problems, he said that
Africans in general have
become stereotyped.

“A lot of people have mis-
conceptions about us that
have to be addressed,” Lewis
said. “We want to represent
ourselves, we don’t want to
be seen as ‘those pitiful peo-
ple who need help.’ We have
pride in who we are and what
we are.”

Although ASO was
launched formally just this
month, the idea for the orga-
nization was developed last

semester. The group of stu—.

dents, who initiated its forma-
tion, only arrived in the

K. Leroy Irvis and Maryann
F. Fralic received the first-
ever Distinguished Alumni
Fellows awards at the 1993
Honors Convocation held
earlier this year.

The awards, given by Pitt’s
Alumni Association, will be
presented annually in recog-
nition of outstanding profes-
sional achievement and com-
munity service.

Irvis served in the
Pennsylvania House of
Representatives for 30 years,
the last eight years as
Speaker of the House. He
was the first African-
American speaker of any leg-
islature .in the United States.
He also held the speaker’s
position longer than any
other Pennsylvania speaker
since 1776.

During his tenure in the
House, Irvis was known for
speaking out against racism
and for supporting the
course of civil rights. In
1971, he introduced legisla-
tion for the Pennsylvania
Education
Opportunity Act (Act 101).

Irvis served as a Pitt trustee

and taught in the Graduate
School of Public and
International Affairs. He has

-been a director or trustee of

many civic organizations,
including Community Action
Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh
Council for the Arts and the
Neighborhood Assistance
Advisory Board.

Irvis graduated from Pitt’s
School of Law after earning a
master’s degree in teaching
from the University of New
York at Albany in 1939.

Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor, in his speech pre-
senting Irvis’ award, said that
his commitment to
Pennsylvania and to the civil
rights of all Americans is
“both profound and far-
reaching.” ‘

“IIrvis’] life stands as a
magnificent testimony to the
liberating power of law
when it is applied wisely and
compassionately,” O’Connor
said.

Distinguished Alumni
Fellow Maryann F. Fralic is
senior vice president of nurs-
ing at Robert Wood Johnson
University Hospital in New
Brunswick, N.J., and associ-
ate dean at the College of
Nursing at

Rutgers

University. She has held both
of these positions since 1984.
Fralic recently became
chairperson of the National
Advancement Committee of
the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation Link program,
which supports minority and
‘low—income health-care per-
sonnel in nursing schools.

She is a leader in the
Robert Wood Johnson
Hospital Health Professions
Scholars program, which
encourages minority junior
high and secondary school
students to enter health-care
professions and holds mast-
head positions in several
professional associations.

Fralic earned a master’s
degree from Pitt’s School of
Nursing and received a doc-
torate from the School of
Public Health.

“Through IFralic’sl healing
touch, compassionate heart
and sagacious mind she
has advanced her profession
and extended first-rate nurs-
ing care to thousands of
patients. Her career exempli-
fies the highest quality of
excellence in the complex,
interdisciplinary field of
Contemporary nursing,”
O’Connor said.

Staff Writer ~

Provost Donald Henderson announced
yesterday that Dr. Kenneth Metz is the
new dean of Pitt’s School of Education.

Metz, who served as interim dean since
the fall of 1990, said he is happy with the
decision.

“It’s a big boost,” he said.

As the new dean, Metz said he has a‘
number of issues with which he wants to
deal. One is to get the School of
Education involved with the Pittsburgh
community and start promoting education-

promotes community reform

al reform, especially in urban areas like
the Pittsburgh city schools.

Another issue is to begin evaluating pro-
fessors in the School of Education and
determine what their teaching, scholarship
and research responsibilities should be.

Metz also said he wants to maintain the
quality level of instruction provided in the
school.

“I want to continue the process, to really
look at the full range of our school,” he
said about academic priorities.

“How can you make the
decision even to continue in
this process?” Knauer asked.
“It shows a lack of concern
for what this university
stands for.”

SGB President Jacob Brody
joined in, telling Knauer and
other concerned students
that they could not expect
O’Connor to give definite
answers or an official deci-
sion when they have not
seen the full reports yet.

“Pitt has not said yes or
no,” Brody said. “Pitt is still
looking into various sites.”

One student asked if there
were any deadlines for Pitt

to decide on its commitment D

to the project but was told
there were none.

Brody, acting as mediator
for the forum, found himself
being questioned’ about
rumors linking him with sex-
ual harassment.

“I’ve heard them myself,”
Brody replied. “They’re
absolutely false.”

Brody said his involvement
in student government has
placed him in the limelight.

“My name is all over the
place. It’s easy for someone
to say one thing,” he said. “It
bugs the hell out of me,
because I haven’t done any-
thing wrong.”

Pitt student Cassie Geyier
asked him if the matter had
ever been discussed in a
meeting within the SGB.
Brody said it had not.

Pitt’s Study Abroad pro-
gram was brought up by stu-
dent Kristen Sukalac and
several other members of
Students Around the World.
She asked O’Connor the sta-
tus of a scholarship fund for
the program.

Sukalac gave a detailed
history of past attempts at
increasing the scholarship
fund for Pitt’s Study Abroad
program.

In the 1991 SGB election,
72 percent of the 1,500 vot-
ing students were willing to
pay $1 more in tuition for a

Study Abroad scholarship

fund, according to Sukalac.

Sukalac asked O’Connor if
the university was dedicated
to helping its students expe-
rience other cultures first-
hand.

“As students, we feel the
scholarship fund is very
important,” she said. “It’s too
late for us _to benefit but not
for students in the future.”

O’Connor said that the
plan is currently before the
planning and budget com-
mittee.

“It’s on the table, it,hasn’t
fallen off,” he said.

O'Connorisms

Yesterday afternoon on the fifth floor of the William
Pitt Union the Student Government Board conducted
the last of five student forum meetings. April Fool's Day
came early. Nothing we could write would capture the
full essence of this meeting — a meeting in which the
Keystone cops met the Three Stooges.

Therefore, we have left it up to the participants them-
selves to set the tone for you and allow you to see -the
competency of those students and administrators repre-
senting your interests.

0 ”We pay your salary. ”

— CMU student Josh Knauer to Pitt Chancellor J.

Dennis O’Connor.

0 ”Tbe reinstatement of Reuben will be discussed only
after a lot of discussion ”

—- Athletic Director Oval Jaynes, when questioned by
a student about the incident involving football player
Reuben Brown.

0 ”Possibly illegal can mean possibly legal, OK?”

—- Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor when questioned
about the possibility of illegal actions and suppressed
information on the Mt._ Graham question

_ - ’’We will pour tbe tuition increase into financial aid

—~ O’Connor on the justification of a tuition increase
that is above the -national level of inﬂation.

0 ”I tbinle tbere’s a difference of opinion as to whether or
not it [tbe red squirrel] is endangered.”

—— O’Connor commenting about the possibility of the
red squirrel being alive and well. (The red squirrel is on

the national endangered list.)

0 ”He’s tbe fiftb bigbest paid player in tbe world, solI’m
wondering why be’d be hanging out in Oaleland. ” '
-—Jaynes discussing NFL star Sean Gilbert’s social life.

0 “Especially at tbe ‘O. 
, —- Perennial Pitt protestor Erin Bush putting in her
two cents.

-”W/bo told you tbat—— Wbo.?Wbo?Wb,o?”

—— Assistant Vice Chancellor for Business and Finance
John DeVitto in response to a participant who thought
the security fee would be used to hire new police offi-
cers. ’

So here you have it folks. It’s too bad that this forum
was the last one of the year. For those of you under-
graduates who are returning: next time we recommend
you come see the fireworks for yourselves. And remem-
ber what your mother told you — next time think
before you open your mouth.

Wondering about who the victim is

red Johnson is a steel-

worker living on the out-

skirts of Pittsburgh. He
got his job right out of high
school making minimum wage
and has worked in the same
mill for 20 years. Since Fred
was hired, he got married,
bought a house and had two
kids. And now as his first child
applies to college, Fred found
out he is about to be fired. The
mill had to follow government
regulations for Affirmative
Action. Now Fred’s job is no
more. He lost it to a woman
named Sue Jamison —— a recent
graduate of Mercer Community
College.

Fred was fired because he is
a straight white male —- not
because he was a bad worker
or wasn’t loyal to the company.
Hardly an isolated case, stories
like this are popping up all
over the country.

Well, I have a confession to
make. My name is Cameron
Harvey, and I feel sorry for
Fred Johnson. Like him, I am
also a straight white male. And
I’m slightly worried about my
place in society.

For the straight white male
things have changed -— even in
the microcosm of Pitt. For bet-
ter or for worse, special interest
groups such as CWO, BiGALA
and BAS have become the
loudest voices on campus. As a
result of this power shift a lot
of egos have been bruised. The
days of the straight, white male
being in the majority are gone.

‘And so are the days of unilater-

al respect. Individuals across
the country are being attacked

on all fronts for being like Fred
Johnson.

What we are seeing today,
however, is a slow transition,
not a usurpation of white male
rights. No longer can the Jim
Bakers, G. Gordon Liddys and
Pete Roses get away with what
they once did. The justice sys-
tem, while it has moved slowly,
is reacting against injustices
committed by straight, white
men. A
Admittedly, some members
of the establishment confuse
justice with victimization. They
seem to think that the opportu-
nities for jobs and promotion
have ceased when they see Bill

Cameron
Harvey

Clinton choose his cabinet
members based on sex and
race. Although 80 percent of all
Fortune 500 companies and 92
percent of America’s governors
are still straight, white men
many men still fear the plight
of Fred Johnson. There is still a
cloudier problem though, and
that is the enactment of quota
laws. There is no denying that
many straight, white men have
been passed over by minorities
to fill certain job slots.

But, these are not the majority

of cases, or even a medium-

sized minority of cases. Yet
they get the most press.
Statistics from Newsweek show
that on average the black
unemployment rate has risen,
not fallen, since the installation

of Affirmative Action laws.

_ Even so, many straight, white
males cannot cut it in the job
market today. They are finding
it out the hard way,by failing to
get promotions. To save face,
many employers tell these men
that their jobs are going to a
minority worker.-

There is, however, clear dis-
crimination against the straight,
white male today -—- that is the
diminution of society’s white,
male heroes like Columbus and
Jefferson. In human history,
there are only four individuals
who I can think of that have
not been attacked for some sort

of moral failing; Christ,

Ghandi, King and Buddha.

But human beings are not
perfect, and realizing this, we
should celebrate these and all
people for their virtues, and
not posthumously denigrate
them for their faults and igno-
rances. Especially when their
fault was being a straight, white
male.

As straight, white men we
must realize that we are not the

only race of people that have

rights or enjoy privileges. Yet
we should not have to be
forced to stomach every attack
launched upon us from groups
unlike ourselves. Not every
straight, white male is homo-
phobic, a racist or a chauvinist.

Fred Johnson lost his job
because he was a straight,white
male. He had a reason to be
angry, but do you?

The Pitt women’s swim-
ming program is in a state
of confusion and mourning
one day after the surprise
resignation of longtime head
coach Dr. David Belowich.

Belowich turned in his
resignation to the Pitt athlet-
-ic department yesterday,
effectively ending 12 years
of service to the -university
athletic community. He told
the team of the resignation
at an afternoon meeting at
the EP Room under Pitt

For Pitt football, the long road
back to respectability begins with
defense. And believe it or not, the
1995 Pitt defense will be in attack
mode. -

Last season, the Panther defense
ranked among the very worst in
Division I football, (91st out of 107
teams) allowing 411 yards per
game. Week in and week out, the
numbers told the story of the hor-
ror show that was the 1992 Pitt
defense — 596 yards allowed to
Minnesota, 557 to Maryland 534 to
Penn State, 521 to Notre Dame
and 505' to West Virginia.

Opponents ran the football at
will, lancing Pitt’s soft middle for
nearly 220 yards per game on a
whopping 5.2 yards per cany. The
Panthers could not fare any better
defending ‘the pass either, and a
large part of the problem was an
anemic pass rush that registered
just 12 sacks all season.

Spring drills are underway at
Pitt, and head coach Johnny
Majors will entrust the defensive
reconstruction to new defensive
coordinator Chuck Driesbach.
Dn'esbach, fonner defensive coor-
dinator at Comell, brings 18 years
of Division I-A coaching experi-
ence. Prior to his stint at Comell,
Driesbach held assistant coaching
positions at Mississippi, East
Carolina, Wake Forest and Kansas
State.

The 3-4 alignment that the
Panthers ran during,Paul Hacketfs
tenure is out. That “read and react“
system will be replaced with a
new Multiple 4-3 system.
Driesbach said that the new sys-
tem does contain some similarities
but emphasized that this is an
“attack” defense.

“I don’t know that it is com-
pletely dilferent. Pitt’s defense last
year never really found a base.
They showed a lot of different

‘ things,” Driesbach said. “This is a

4-3 package. The way we’re look-
ing to run it is like Miami of
Florida and now the Dallas
 'Ihey’re -the people that
have made it the most popular
because they’ve had success with
it.”

stuff — and then announced
his resignation,” Pitt sopho'-
more Christy Knobloch said.
“Then he just walked out.”

Though no official expla-
nation was given as to why
Belowich resigned,
Knobloch noted thatthe
longtime coach “pretty much
said it was time to move
on.”

“It was nothing against
administration or us,”
Knobloch said. “It was just
time for something differ-
ent.”

“None of us know the
story behind it,” Pitt senior
Clare McShane said. “We
never saw it coming.”

Belowich could not be

reached for comment at his
Butler residence. '

The announcement
shocked players and coach-
es, neither of which saw the
resignation coming.

“Nobody had any clue
[that Belowich would quitl,”
Knobloch said. “Everybody
was very upset. It shocked
everyone.”

“I thought they’d have to
cart him out,” senior captain
Clare McShane said. “I never
thought he would go out on
his own will.

“You could definitely say
it was a sad day. He really
brought a name to Pitt
swimming.”

Matt Serlin/The Pitt News

The return of Tom Tumulty's enthusiasm and talent is a big boost to the Pitt defense.

The common element among
those dominating defenses is
speed and quickness, and Pitt
defenses have struggled in recent
seasons because of their deficiency
in this area.

“You have only two down line-
men. Both of your inside tackles
are down. The outside ends are
really fast down linemen or large
linebackers. Speed is very, very
important there, so is quickness,”
Driesbach said. _

That is where two of the keys to
Driesbach’s scheme, linebacker
Tom Tumulty and defensive end
Dell Seagraves, will ‘play a vital
role. Seagraves, a 6-foot 5-inch,
240-pound sophomore, has
moved from outside linebadter to

ment. Seagiaves started five games

After owning the confer-
ence crown since it incep-

to third place in each of the
last two league meets —
behind two-time champion
Villanova and conference
newcomer Miami of Florida.

As the rain steadily
flowed upon an
already saturated Trees
Field yesterday, the Pitt
baseball team
improved its record to
an impressive 15-2
while ‘pounding out hit
after hit, running
Gannon University into
the ' soggy Oakland
ground.

The Panthers lam-
basted the Golden
Knights with a 16-run,
14-hit barrage in which
eight of the nine
starters garner at least
one hit.

“We like to go out
there and play the
same caliber of ball
every game, whether it
be at St. john’s or
Gannon,” Pitt second
baseman Brad Reese
said. “You want to
remain at the same
level every game -
you don’t want to
come down to a team’s
level or play up to
another’s.”

The win was Pitt’s
second consecutive
victory since splitting a
pair of decisions at Big
East rival Villanova and
gave them another
afternoon to showcase
their explosive offense.

“It shouldn’t be hard
[to get up for the
weaker teams] at all,”
Pitt head coach Mark
Jackson said. “You

Intruding into

unknown turf, a documena sns

By Bill Kirchner
Staff Writer

Brotber’s Keeper is a film about
intrusion. The kind that invades a
small farm community in central New
York when 60-year-old Delbert Ward
is accused of murdering his older
brother. As Delbert’s case unfolds the
life of the Ward brothers evolves in
front of the camera; and as it does so
does the significance of those events.

As one of the Wards’ neighbors puts

it, “the boys” had always been margin— .

al figures in their own community. But
when the media and the law upset that
delicate rural balance the community
gets behind Delbert and his brothers,

Roscoe and Lyman, in a pretty fierce
and defiant defense effort. It’s a case
of “we against them” as one man
defines it.

The documentary itself becomes part
of the media intrusion it captures.
When directors Joe Berlinger and
Bruce Sinofsky question the brothers
on their farm, their questions and cam-
era become obtrusive, acknowledging
that the documentary itself is just
another invasive element in the story.
At the same time, Brot/9er’s Keeper
focuses on the media coverage of the
whole affair through montages of TV
news reports and film of those reports
being made. It’s difficult to miss the
point when we see, time after time,

microphones being pushed into the
faces of the Ward boys as they’re
forced to watch Connie Chung distort
their predicament for the purpose of
television. In the end, Brothers Keeper
maintains a» self—reflexive commentary
on the nature of media investigation.

Something that ties in nicely with the
defense argument, that the police are
performing a similar disservice as the
media, is where the underlying pathos
of the film resides. How could this illit-
erate inarticulate man understand the
confession he signed? Berlinger and
Sinofsky play this angle as well as
Delbert’s attorney, and, though not
without sentiment, it works.

The use of Delbert’s recorded ques-

tioning dubbed over scenes of the
brothers working on the farm become
the film’s most expressive moments.
What the story-doesn’t do to illustrate
intrusion these segments fill in and
even take that crucial element to
another level in juxtaposing their visu-
al pastorale with the harsh inflection
of Delbert’s weary denials.

Berlinger and Sinofsky make their
biggest mistake with the films music.
The twangy bluegrass borders on
imposing parody on the events it is
supposedly in support of. It’s a rela-
tively small one though. overshad-

Love once again floats through the air leaving
Pittsburghers’ faces as slick and glossy as satin pillow
cases. Last spring, I too felt the impending sweetness.
But I blamed it on blossoming ragweed and cute boys.
This year —— well, this year’s a_ different story, thanks to
the matchmakers at WPTS-FM. It seems that these
shortwave Cupids want to shove tenderness and beau-
ty down our pink throats with cute bands playing coy
melodies. First Unrest and the Karl Hendricks Trio on
Tuesday and now, playing for a special Sunday event,
it’s NYC’s Sleepyhead, DC’S Eggs and our own sassy

Slumberland Records (its previous two on Picture

Disc’s Cbmny Clam Clam extravaganza with fellow Big
Applers, Fantastic Palace, Kicking Giant and Wall
Drug. They’re suckers for swell cover songs that they
mutate into brief, feedback-filled fits like their version
of My Bloody Valentine’s “Thorn” (featured on their
second 7”) and Clean’s “Thumbs Off’ (on Cleaned Out

Airlines).

Like a good egg cream, Chris O’Rourke (g/V),

Growing up, the sleep-
scape of my childhood was
plagued with about four or
five recurring dreams that
never quite fit into the
explainable realm of my
young life.

So, by the time I outgrew
my Health-Tex rompers, I

did what any suburban, hip‘

teenager would do. I attrib-
uted them to reincarnation
or at least some sort of psy-
cho schmaltz that made
everything fit into a neat lit-
tle package.

The problem with this is
that things rarely fit and try-
ing to make them is usually a
futile exercise. Pitt’s theater
department engages itself in
one of these exercises in its
production of Karmic Soap
Opera, 21 play exploring the
concept of reincarnated
love.‘

Karmic Soap Opera is not
at all a bad play. It has many
surprisingly humorous
moments. It simply will not
be remembered as one of
the great dramas of the cen-
tury.

Playwright Sherry Narens
establishes a world where
the instruments of time call
the shots except when we
wayward humans decide
things on our own terms and
screw up the flow leaving

the instruments to fix our

On Lesbian culture, socially and
militarily, Faderman is assertive

By Melissa Smith
For The Pitt News

Did the military help to create the large
subcultures of lesbians? Indeed, the military
even “helped to introduce lesbians who had
honorable discharges to large metropolitan
areas where they could meet others like
themselves,” according to Dr. Lillian
Faderman. Do you ever wonder why San
Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and Boston
have large populations of gays and lesbians?
Well, it was the government that transformed
these port cities into large gay and lesbian
communities. You probably won’t learn that
in your military history class, but you can

attend a talk by Faderman this Saturday
evening, April 5, at 8 p.m. in the William Pitt
Union Ballroom.

The talk is titled “Naked Amazons and
Queer Damsels: A History of Lesbians in the
Military.” From the American Revolution to
Desert Storm, Faderman presents an historical
perspective of the most often overlooked and
underestimated group in the military —
women who love other women.

Faderman came out as a working-class les-
bian in the 19505 when McCarthyism was still
giving its tenor to American life. and lesbians
were outlaws. Coming out at this time
restricted one’s options, but she supported

You get the impression that
there’s a lot of pressure on
Naughty By Nature.

Pressure to duplicate or sur-
pass the group’s overwhelming
success of the last two years.
Pressure to stay true to hip-hop.
And maybe most of all, pres-
sure to carry the load for a

the ﬂavor. The glaring weak-

of Naughty’s trademark, the ’

keyboards of nimble-fingered
Dave Bellochio. Yes, he’s still
heard sparsely here and there
on certain tracks, but the void is
a deep one. Compound that
with a very light, almost synthe-
sized bass sound and often ﬂat,
boring drumtracks, and the
music is lacking. -

herself through college stripping and became
a pinup model. Faderman received her bach-
elor’s degree from Berkeley in 1962, then
returned to UCLA for her graduate work
where she today teaches as a visiting profes-
sor.

‘It was after the publication of Surpassing

A the Love ofMen that Fadermantreceived com-

munity—wide support for her lesbian scholar-
ship. She was even recognized by the mayor
of Fresno who declared May 1, 1981 as
“Lillian Faderman Day.” g

In her latest book, Odd Girls and Twilight
Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life .in
Twentieth—Century America, Faderman
chronicles how the “lesbian community” has
grown and changed over the years.

Even the term “lesbian” is fairly new in our
language: the category was formulated in the
second half of the '19th century by European
sexologists. Over the years, women have
described themselves as such, but not with
the sexologists’ understanding of “the female
sexual invert.” ~

Faderman asserts that the lesbian identity
today is not the same as it was'in the begin-
ning of this century, arguing that American
culture, institutions and the ability of women
being financially independent have all con-
tributed to the shaping of the lesbian identity
as we know it today.

These social conditions have made the les-
bian identity possible and desirable for many

women. Faderman aligns herself with a social
construction theory of sexuality, those who
believe that certain social conditions were
needed before a lesbian social identity could
ever exist. In Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers,
Faderman traces this evolution.

Speaking to the “six months of discussion”
regarding the Department of Defense direc-
tive that states “Homosexuality is incompati-
ble with military service,” Dr. Faderman’s his-
torical perspective on lesbians in the military
charts new waters. ,

With the discussion around gays and les-

bians in the military, there is rarely any men-
tion of the lesbians, who remain invisible in
this “controversial” issue. Faderman’s presen-
tation brings this invisibility to a halt.
V Faderman is a professor of English at
California State University in Fresno and a
visiting professor at UCLA. She is also the
author of Surpassing the Love of Men:
Romantic Friendship and Love Between
Women from the Renaissance to the Present,
and a forthcoming book, Love Between
Women in Drag.- Decoding Lesbian
Literature. _

much should be expected from ‘

such talent. This isn’t suggest-
ing that 19NaugbtyIII is a weak
effort. Disappointing, yes. But
disappointing doesn’t mean
there aren’t ﬂashes of Naughty’s
brilliance. There are some slam-
ming tracks on this album.
“Cruddy Click” is the hardest
cut on the album, bringing a
definite street feel, heavy hit-
ting beats with Treach fiercely
drilling everyone in his path, all
attitude, warning “pick a place,
a time/ a rhyme, a flow, a feel,
a vibe/ pick a f—-in’ style of
your own/ stop pickin’ mine.”
Naughty enhances the hard fla-
vor-with some adventurous

sampling and an eerie saxo-

phone loop.

“The Hood Comes First” res-
urrects a sound reminiscent of
Naughty’s first record, complete
with the trademark highhat and
drum kick, highlighted with
light keyboard and horn sam-
ples and deeper, resonating
bass. Treach demonstrates the
flow that makes him one of the
elite.

“It’s On” kicks along, built
around a sampled trumpet loop
from Donald Byrd and ﬂowing
over driving beats that will
remind you of “Ghetto Bastard”

while a flavorful chorus that
samples Leaders of the New
School gets props. These three
tracks are the standouts. After
that, the group drops off some.
“Daddy Was A Street Corner”
is a solid all—around effort as far
as evenly blending diverse
beats with some of Treach’s
finer lyrics, telling the story of
his rough childhood. This is
one of the few cuts that the
bass drives, along with an
appearance of those missing
keyboards. —
Perhaps the track that best
exemplifies what Bellochio’s
keyboards meant to Naughty
on the last album is
“Sleepwalkin’ II,” where the
undistinguished light bass and

flat beats are tolerable, due to‘

the added ﬂavor of the key-
boards. “Sleepin’ On Jersey,”
featuring Queen Latifah, gets
props for its infectious ener-
geticrgroove and once again
T reach’s ‘flow.

“Hip Hop Hooray” is this
album’s “O.P.P.,” a catchy,
commercial smash and a video
in heavy rotation on MTV and
BET. There’s really nothing
more to say about this song
since everyone has heard it a

both prickly and mushy. Sleepyhead’s
an enjoyable listen like other
Slumberland bands but quite raw com-
pared to some of the label’s candy—coat-
ed sweetness.

On the group’s newest 7”, Sleepyhead
kicks and throttles on “Punk Rock City
USA,” but the real nod happens to be
the flip: a blustery cover of Game
T heory’s “Like A Girl Jesus.” Drummer
Rachael McNally lends her pure and
innocent Voice to create swift, sappy
sass.

Their newest project is a 10 song
Slumberland release entitled Pun/e Rocle
City USA. Expect to hear some material
from it on Sunday.

Adding to the coquettish flair is Teen

Beat recording artists Eggs. They’re no
strangers to Pittsburgh, either, playing
with Unrest last year as well as perform-
ing as the in—house band at a Squirrel
Hill fete. Guitarist/vocalist A. Beaujon,
bassist E. Shurak and trombonist/some
time drummer R. Christianson (also in
trio, Grenadine with Unrest’s M.E.
Robinson and T ttttt~sunami’s J. T oomey)
have been busy recording/releasing a
handful of singles in a few months time.
While the melodies charm, it’s obvious
that there’s more behind the band than
mere mediocrity. Upbeat and unobtru-
sive but layered with (ahem) scrambled
tones of superb musicianship, Eggs’
songs are intricate and stormy.

Resident drummer J. Rickman no
longer plays with the band, deciding to
pursue his more sonic tendencies. While

he did play on the group’s Bruiser LP
and on its soon-to-be—released Teen
Beat LP, it seems that Eggs is currently
without a skinman, so don’t expect
party music.

Word has it that Eggs teamed with
local Wimp Factor 14 for a collaboration
7”, recorded during Blizzard of ‘93 while
WF laid tracks for an (aptly numbered)
14 song CD (to be released on Harriet
Records in May). While WF’s lineup has
changed with guitarist Rob Washburn’s
postgrad projects, all seems to be settled
and comfortable. After found object
master Gary MackLewsuck opted to play
guitar, Karl Hendricks Trio’s Tom
Hoffman drummed for a few songs, only
to be usurped by Tiny Little Help’s Joelle
Leavitt. Frank Boscoe still sings and ban-
jos, Rob Washburn rejoins in his pregrad

position as guitarist and bassist Kate
Glicksburg not only plays her stuff but
sings it, too. While the charismatic and
warm sound is the same, be assured that
it is more intricate and groomed.

They’re even crossing time zones this
summer in order to spread the Wimp
legend to devoted fans who heard them
on the German Mermaid label’s release,
He Dia’n’t Even Draw A Fish Orr My
Sbower Curtain comp. Love them while
they’re still ours, brothers and sisters.

Grab yer spring season sweet heart
and packer up for WPYS-FM’s louet-tme
ball at David Lawrence'Hall orz Pitt’s
campus. Local troublemaleers
GangBartg will play first, then Wimp
Factor, then Eggs and then S/eepybead.
It’ll be a suppertime show, starting at 6
pm.

The end of the month finally came. What a great month
it was, too! We set a new sales record. My company
profits were at an all—time high. I've poured by life into
this company, and things are going better than I could
ever have imagined. In a few more years, it will be time
to relax and enjoy the fruits of my labor. Actually, I
already have a lotto show for my sweat. I drive the car
of my dreams - a Jaguar. My $300,000 home is the envy
of all my friends, and I have a boat thatanyone would
relish. Things are going great . . .

But God said to him, "You fool, this very night
you must surrender your life; you have made your
money - who will get it now?” That is how it is with the
man who amasses wealth for himself and remains a
pauper in the sight of God [Luke 12:20 - 21]

Are you trying to become wealthy for yourself, while
remaining poor in God's sight? When the night comes
for you to surrender your life, will God call you a fool?

Now is the time to decide what you want to commit
your life to. We are truly foolish if we make materialism
and worldly wealth our goal in life. ~

Our goal should be to serve God. Our goal should be to
commit our whole being to becoming wealthy in the
sight of God. On your last day, will God say, "You
fool”, or will He say ”Well done, my good and faithful

just as much as I want to
spend every day in the
kitchen being a slave under
the pretense of marriage.
This is. nothing new
although it is sometimes
interesting.

The reason most people
believe in reincarnation is
because it attempts to
explain the unexplainable.
Director Sarah Barker is in
tune with this. She has her

 

characters doing something
or looking unsuccessfully
for something that they
know is there. All of a sud-
den it appears, courtesy of
the instruments, and the
actors look appropriately
confus-ed.

The cast of Karmic Soap
Opera is talented enough
to handle the loopy script.
It takes a more than compe-
tent cast to be able to jump
through as many characters

and time periods as Narens
creates.

The instruments are
onstage to literally set up
each storyline in its respec-
tive time period. However,
sometimes it seems like
they are onstage too
long, which is understand-
ably necessary. But, never-
theless, their constant
mumbling and burbling,
while quaint at first,
becomes incredibly annoy-

ing.

The set of Karmic Soap
Opera is extensive to say
the least. Bearing an obvi-
ous Klimt influence, the
stage is flooded with
gold leaf and funky art nou-
veau designs. A pool of
foam penetrates the middle
of the stage contributing
to the surreal lands-
cape.

College basketball takes center stage in New Orleans

It’s on. The Final Four. The
elite event in all of sport. 1993
brings us four powerhouses,
four teams that stayed among
the nation’s seven or eight elite
all season. For Kentucky it was
a breeze to New Orleans. No
team in recent memory, includ-
ing the Larry Johnson—Stacey
Augmon UNLV wrecking
crews, dominated the first two
weekends of the tourney the
way the Wildcats have this one.
Enough said. A

Michigan has been maligned
all year, and that in itself is
proof of how sick some in the
media are. The Big Blue bash-
ing was almost interesting for
about a day, but it became old
and tired quickly. It’s not
enough for Michigan to win,
now it has to look like the ulti-
mate basketball machine and a
bunch of choirboys while
doing it. Results are what Chris

Pens with
ex—Adams
family in

new NHL
alignment

By Ryan Buncher
Sports Editor

Quick, somebody tell
Cam Neely he is going
to be in the same divi-
sion with Ulf ‘
Samuelsson again.

In a new realignment
format announced yes-
terday, Samuelsson and
the Pittsburgh Penguins
will be joining the
teams currently in the
Adams Division next
year in what will be
called the Northeast
Division.

The Pens’ new divi-
sion rivals will be
Neely’s Boston Bruins,
the Montreal Canadiens,
Buffalo Sabres, Quebec
Nordiques, Hartford
Whalers and Ottawa
Senators.

The other former
Patrick Division teams
will be joined by the
Tampa Bay Lightning
and Miami’s expansion
team in the Atlantic
Division.

In addition to the
new alignment, the
NHL is changing its
playoff format. It is
adopting a system like
the NBA currently has.
The two division cham-
pions will get the top
two seeds in the con-
ference playoffs. After
that, the six teams with
the highest point totals
—- regardless of divi-

sion — will reach the
postseason.
Now maybe the

Samuelsson-Neely bat-
tle can continue in
earnest.

Webber and the boys bring. —
that and the most entertaining
style in America.

Let’s see, in 1992 the Fab V
went to the Final Four, as first-
year players, and beat a tough
Cincinnati outfit before losing
to Duke in the finals.

This season, as sophomores,
the Wolverines are 30-4 and
back in the ‘Final Four. Their
losses — two at the hands of
Indiana by one point, one at
Duke and one at Iowa (an
emotionally charged club play-
ing inspired in its first home

.game after Chris Street’s tragic

death). They played a schedule
rated the toughest in college
basketball, already beat both
North Carolina and Kansas
(both without an injured Ray
Jackson) and are back for a
title shot. Sound like ‘a bunch
of big underachievers to you?
Why it should concern peo-

ple how long their shorts are or
what color their socks and
sneakers are is beyond com-
prehension. So Michigan is
fashion conscious. The team
looks good on the ﬂoor. It likes
to laugh and have fun playing
the game. That doesn’t mean
the team’s a bunch of punks. It
would be nice if someone rec-
ognized the heart this team
had. Get off their backs.

In the first game Saturday,
two clones, North Carolina and
Kansas meet in a rematch of
the 1991 semi-ﬁnals. Both clubs
are significantly better this time
around, and this one’ should be

tight. Two of the most under- ’

rated forwards in America, NC’s
George Lynch and Kansas’
Richard Scott will play vital
roles.‘ The Jayhawk backcourt
of Adonis Jordan, Rex Walters
and Steve Woodberry has no
equal, but Carolina counters

with Eric Montross, who should
put up huge numbers inside.
All this off sets and the depth
factor cancels out with tw
great benches. '
Just one question, though.
How is it that Michigan wins
close games in which it coasts
and struggles at times and has
player who are “undisciplined
and immature underachievers,”
yet North Carolina does it (see
two extremely fortunate wins
over Arkansas and Cincy) and
it’s the greatest team in
America to some people?
Strange. Regardless, take
Carolina over KU in a wire job.
The second game should be
a classic with scorching
Kentucky battling explosive
Michigan. The Wolverines will
rise to the occasion and push
Rick Pitino’s club, making this
a classic. But Pitino is a huge
advantage in this one. The one

thing Michigan critics are cor-
rect about is Steve Fisher. Jamal
Mashburn and Webber on the
same floor is all you need to
know. For some reason, some—
thing tells me that Michigan
will be sizzling here, but it is
Pitino’s time. Take logic over
gut feeling and take Kentucky.
In the final, take the Wildcats
by a comfortable margin over
North Carolina.
All-Tournament Team: MVP:
Mashburn, Travis Ford and
Jared Prickett (Kentucky),
Lynch and Brian Reese (NC)
and Webber.

for the Big East games, but it
shouldn’t be because you’re
only playing so many games
in the season.”

“We started a little slow
today and yesterday, but after
the Big East comes, we
should be a lot better,” Walsh
said. “We’ve got to start earli-
er, though.” 7

Catcher Jerry Berteotti
paced the Panthers with a
line-drive grand slam in the
fifth.

With one out, the bases

loaded in the inning, Gannon ‘

pitcher Ryan _Ranfos got
ahead 1-1 on Berteotti then
froze him with a tough curve
ball. Ahead 1-2 in the count,
Ranfos decided to throw up
the deuce again ‘ — and
watched it sail over the left
field wall.

“I had two strikes and I
didn’t even swing at the first
two,” Berteotti said. “I figured
he’d come back with the
curve ball because I looked at
it twice before, so I was just

ties until a new coach is
named. _ ’

While the search has
begun fora new coach,
the Panthers pondered what
it will be like without the
man, that recruited each
of them to the Pittsburgh
area.

“Our team has had so
many difficulties the past
two years,” Pitt sophomore
Geubtner said, alluding to a
plethora of injuries and per-
sonal problems on the team.
“But this is the biggest chal-
lenge we’re ever going to
face.”

With the immediacy of the‘

change, most swimmers
expressed a sense of sad-
ness and uncertainty when
talking of the immediate
future. '
“The only thing I kept
thinking about is the fact
that you don’t realize what
you have  until it’s gone,”
Knobloch said. “If we get a
hard-ass in here next year‘,
it will be difficult [to
adjustl.’-’ I
While the immediate ques-
tions remain as to why
Belowich ended his stay at
Pitt, Geubtner focused on
the need to respect the deci-
sion of the man who
brought respect and honor

to women’s swimming at

Pitt. .

“He’s given so much to
us,” Geubtner said. “We
should respect him in his
decision that he just
couldn’t give any more of
himself.” '

“It’s kind of an end of.an
era,” Geubtner said. “We, as
upperclassmen, will have to
take on .the responsibility of
leaders for the rest of the
team.

“I don’t think it’s going to
be easy.”

sitting back and waiting for
it.” ,

Berteotti also doubled in
the fourth, driving in a total
of four runs and scoring
one."

“[They weren’t throwing
anything up there] that was
above average or close to
what we will be seeing in
the Big East,” Berteotti said.

Pitcher Brian Shaffer went
four strong innings for Pitt
—— giving four hits and one
earned run while striking
out four.

“I was just happy to get a
few innings in and get some
work,” Shaffer said. “[The

offensive support] was great.

It’s easy to go out and throw
with 16 runs.”

“Brian threw OK — it’s the
first time he’s thrown since
lthe spring trip in] Florida,”
Jackson said. “He had an
ankle injury down there and
he hasn’t pitched live in a
game situation for over three
weeks, so I thought he
pitched fine considering [the
situationsl.”

Pitt failed to‘ score in the
first but made up for it by
notching four runs on three
hits in the second.

Brad Reece drew a lead-
off walk and stole second
base, eventually scoring on
Greg Christman’s single.
Christman was tripled in by
Josh Tyler who, in turn, was
driven in on a Danny
Gonzales single. Pat 

\X/.al,sh_,f_ini.'sh.ed the inning,

with a mammoth, opposite-
field blast off the first
Ranfos offering.

‘‘I’m pretty aggressive and
hit the first pitch if it’s
there,” Walsli said. “I’m just
looking for a good pitch to
hit.”

The Golden
answered with their first run
in the top of the third when
third baseman Ronald Rehak
blasted a Shaffer offering
over the left-center power
alley. Gannon would notch
its final run in the fifth when
Joe Dolansky’s double drove
in shortstop Brian Fuller.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursda , A ril 1, 1993

Tumulty

Continued from page 8
also selected to the Football
News’ second team Freshman
All-American squad. Tumulty
perhaps made the strongest
impact on defense in his first
year than anyone since Hugh
Green.

In the ‘92 season Tumulty
was a preseason’ All-
American candidate, but in
the team’s first game against

Kent University he tore pec-
toral muscles, which ended
his season.

“I hope it wasn't a jinx for
me last year being a presea-
son All-American candidate,”
Tumulty said. “I got hurt
early on in the season and I
had to sit out for the rest of
the time. Hopefully this year
I can end up an All-
American at the end of this
season.”

Personal goals are fine and
dandy, but I would rather
receive them after our team

had a winning season -
hopefully having won a
national championship.”

While Tumulty talks of
pursuing national titles, one
of his strengths is pursuit of
ball carriers.

“God gave me a gift to be
able to run, and I just have
football instincts by which I
can kind of tell where the
ball is going,” Tumulty said.
“I was born withsome dif-
ferent things, but also by
watching film and knowing
the defense it lets me be in a
position to make the big
play.” -‘

This year the Panthers will
move to a 4-3 front on
defense and Tumulty will
move from his inside line-
backer position to the out-
side. _

“Right now I am playing
outside linebacker,” Tumulty
said. “Last year I was on the
inside, basically stopping the

run, but this year I’ll be
more involved in pass cover-
age —— sometimes covering a
wide receiver. It is a little
different than last year, but I
like it.”

Tumulty said he feels that
Pitt’s linebackers are a very
good unit.

“Our linebacker corps is
just as good as any line-
backer corps in the country,”
Tumulty said. “Everyone
always talks about Miami’s
linebackers, but they really
were defensive backs play-
ing linebacker, so naturally
they were fast. But when it
comes down to what a line-
backer really is, we. have
three of the best  many of

V the linebackers behind us

could start anywhere in the
country.”

Tumulty said he really
likes the other two lineback-
ers who will comprise the
starting linebacker corps.

“Charles Williams is just a
total powerhouse,” T umulty
said. A“He possesses great
strength, quick feet and he
can really crush a run.

“Gerald Simpson is really
fast. He runs a 4.4 or 4.5 40.
But he is also big at 6-feet 3-
inches, 220 pounds and he
can really bring‘ the wood
when he hits you. I am
probably a combination of
both of them. I have speed
and I can also contain the
run.” '

For Tumulty, the ‘93 sea-
son means so much more to
him because he sat out most
of the ‘92 season.

“Last year I worked so
damn hard in the summer
and in the offseason,”
Tumulty said. “I worked so
hard in camp and lost the
weight that I had to. It just
felt like someone just took it
all away from me [when I
was injured].”

Picks
Continued from page 9
springtime. My champion is still
alive (the frothing Wolverines),
although they’re the luckiest of
the four to grasp a spot at the

Lousy-ana.l

Now for
matchups. '

KENTUCKY vs. MICHIGAN:
This matchup of the best team
vs. the most talented team
should prove to be the better
of the two games Saturday,
hands down.

UK sprints into the
Superdome as clearly the most
dominating team in the country
-— “Mashburn for three! Brown
for three! Ford for three!-,” Bo
U. heads to the semi’s the most
criticized crew of ballplayers
this side of Rich Stadium in
Buffalo — “They're all style! No
class!”

Sounds like a big time spank-
ing for the soph sensations-
turned—big heads? Don’t count
on it.

While Chris Webber and the
sophomore slackers have slum-
bered through the first 20 min-
utes of every tournament game
— only to muster up enough
enthusiasm to slip by the likes
of UCLA, George Washington
and Temple — they’ll be fired
up to prove every semi—knowl-
edgeable hoop reporter wrong.

In a I80—point game that fea-
tures 20 three-pointers and
2,000 dunks, take the show-
timers in a showtime—type
atmosphere. Safe bet says UK
in a wash — go with the better
team. I cringed and said
Michigan at the beginning of
the tourney. I’ll stick to it.

BG’s pick: Michigan.

KANSAS VS. NORTH CAR-
OLINA: First things first. Raise
your hand if you’re sick and
tired of the whole Dean Smith-
Roy Williams matchup. Me,
too. Last I checked, there were
no player/coaches permitted in
NCAA basketball competition.
OK! From here on out, leave
Coaching matchups to NBA
gossip (like Dave Cowens vs.
Lenny Wilkens).

Now for the important stuff.
Kansas, led by Rex “I’m better
than King Rex from Lexington”
Walters, is playing great basket-
ball —- as evident in their
sound beating of tough-as-nails
but not-so-healthy Indiana last
Saturday. -

North Carolina, thanks to
two last-minute snafus by
pesky Arkansas and better
Cincinnati, is back for more
heartbreak.

Kinda tipped my hand, huh?

Bottom line: Kansas has what
Arkansas and Cincy did not
have to bury the Tarheels
when they had the chance -
rock-solid, reliable shooting.
Every season, the Jayhawks
boast a field-goal percentage
among the top five in the
country and do it with mistake-
free precision.

Count on KU’s smart shoot-
ing in a semi-tight second-half
contest to be the difference
against NBA backup Montross
and the close-but-no-cigar
‘Heels.

BG’s pick: Kansas.

Defense

Continued from page 8
and could be the pass nisher Pitt
desperately needs.

The front four will have to apply

pressure in this scheme, because
Driesbach stressed that Pitt will not
be a blitzing team, playing a lot of
zone pass coverages. The coaching

staff believes Seagtaves possesses 0

the ideal size and speed to
become a force from the end posi-
tion.

“They feel [quickness] is one of
my strengths, and I can use my
speed against bigger offensive
guys. That’s one of my best spots
right there,” Seagiaves said.

Tumulty is back from a tom pec-
toral muscle that ended his ‘92
campaign in the first game of the
season. Now a redshirt sopho-
more, Tumulty will take on further
responsibility, moving from his
inside post to an outside lineback-
ing spot in the 4-3. Tumulty is a
dominant linebacker, the 1991 Big
East Conference and ECAC Rookie
of the Year. At 64” and 240
pounds he brings the strength of
an inside player yet boasts tremen-
dous instincts and sideline-to-side-
line pursuit ability to shut down
the outside. T umulty said his tran-
sition to outside backer has been
smooth thus far.

“Right now I’m concentrating on
my speed off the ball,” Tumulty
said. “lfl get a jump off the ball I

A should be in the backﬁeld almost

every time. That should be one of
my strengths right there.”

Neither Seagraves or T umulty
hesitated when asked to cite the
biggest advantage of the new

Matt Serlin/The Pitt few

Dell Seagraves, a rush end in the new Panther scheme,’ stressed theattacking nature of the new defense.

scheme.

“Attack,” Seagraves said. “This
defense now, the 4-3, we’re doing
a lot of attacking.”

“last year our defensive linemen
were waiting, but now they’re
attacking,” T umulty said. “last year

they were playing laterally, but
now we’re attacking.”

If nothing else, the attack mode
mind-set appears to have rejuve-
nated the mental state of the
defense. Just one week into spring
drills, Diiesbach said it is difficult to

gauge if the current talent level of
the Pitt defense is sufficient to run
this scheme effectively. At this
point, the staff is more concerned
with developing an understanding

of the scheme and a positive atti-
tude.

“Talent has an awful lot to do
with it, but if guys know what to
do and play hard, we’ll always
have a chance to be competitive,”
Driesbach said. “Right now were
striving for guys who know what
to do and play hard.”
