SG Letters To Request
Quick Legislative Move

Student Government (SG)
has decided to send a letter
to all-~ state representatives
and senators urging their
quick action on University
state-relatedness legislation.
SG decided to make the move in

a special meeting called to dis-
cuss the issue of state-relation.

 

RALPH _ MANNING
Comments on SFP

iAdmissions 7

Appointment
fMade Public

Bernard Kobosky will be the
new admissions director at’ the
University beginning Friday.’

The appointment ﬁlls a post
left vacant when Jack-B. iCritch-
ﬁeld, former admissions director,
was made Dean of Admissions.

 Kobosky holds his B.A.-
and M.A. degrees from. Duquesne

University and has served there o

during the last five years as as-1
sistant, associate, and acting di-
rector of admissions.

  On State — Relationship

The meeting and he decision’
to mail the letters folowed a rally
sponsored by SG and The Pitt
News, in which students were
vigorously attacked fo-r their
apathy by State Rep. K. Leroy
Irvis. Ralph Manning, president
of SG, remarked that, “It is easy
to understand the student apathy
considering the incredible actions
of the Harrisburg legislators.”

A petition expressingl concern
with the speed of the legislative
process in Harrisburg is also be-
ing circulated in the University
and in the community.

In other business, a resolution
formulated by the Students for
Peace (SFP) was presented to
the Senate. It expressed dismay
that ’a student group, SFP, could
not get a hearing for their ideas
concerning ROTC in the Orienta-
tion program through legal chan-
nels.

Frank Couvares, treasurer for
SFP, presented the resolution and
explained that a meeting had
been arranged with the Orienta-
tion Committee, so that SFP could
air its views. But the meeting
was cancelled. Couvares felt that
this cancellation had impeded
student expression and urged SG.
to act on the resolution.

‘Manning, SG Vice-President
Howard Ainisman, and the six
senators present at the meeting
felt that they could not act on
the proposal, and it was -not pass-
ed. Most of the senators did not
want to act because they felt not
enough senators were present to

.1 consider such a resolution. and

that it was not the place of SG to

’act in any area concerning an

academic department, such as the
ROTC department.

Ainisman suggested that SFP
should contact all T the ,members
of the Orientation Committee in-

Idlvidually and-then try to call
another rrleeting of the commit-
tee.

 Thompson. Studies Problem

Most professionals are ex-
pected to be both efficient
and neat. The “professional”
who broke into the Office of
Alumni Activities in the SU
was extremely efficient but
far from neat.

When the secretaries opened
the door to the office of Thyrsa
Ballantyne, assistant director of
alumni activities, Friday, they

found the contents of desk draw- ,

“Professional Burglar” Robs’ y
Office of Alumni Activities  

ers dumped all over the room
and several objects of “consider-
able value” missing. The thief
apparently had a key to the room
since the door had not been
forced. The, University police of-
ﬁcers who investigated the inci-
dent felt that the job was the
work of a professional burglar.
Captain Charles Ray, chief of
the University Police, coﬁld not
deal with the speciﬁcs of this
case, but he noted that profes-
sional criminals and not students

Dr. Bianculli Honored ,

By Pharmacy Faculty

The dean of the School of Phar-
macy was recently honored as
one of the school’s outstanding;
alumni. Dr. Joseph A. Bianculli
was presented with a Distin-
guished Alumnus Award by the
school’s faculty. A

Others receiving the. school’s
highest honor were Dr; George S.

gram at the National Institutes
of Health, and Edward C. Nied,

a retired community ph,armacist,.

\

"and representative for Abbot
Laboratories.‘ I

Dr. Bianculli was graduated

,Pharmacy, forerunner of the Pitt
school, in 1935. Following re-

search positions with American '

Cyanamid and Reed and Camick
Company, he joined the Pitt fac-

ulty as an assistant professor in 6

1948. He later became _a profes-

, ed dean of the school in 1961.

  Don’t Start Smoking Habit, Report Explainsr,

By BERNIE MCLEOD

The old saying: “A good
way to stop smoking is to

"- never start,” appears to be

borne out in a study by Dr.

. A" - Douglass Thompson, director

of the University Health
Service, soon to be published in
the Journal of the American Med-

 ical Association.
In the ten - month follow - up A

study‘ of 298 cigarette smokers,

' _'including ten'University students,

who participated in a plan to
,smoking, Dr. Thompson

‘found only 16 per cent success-

The Pennsylvania

     
  

Conference :

 

ducted ' the program in Pitts-
burgh in March, 1964, entitled
“A Five-Day Plan to Stop Smok-

ling!’ For their approach they

stressed the part that condition-
ing has on an “intense neuro-
physical habit.” i

During the course of the “Five-
Day Plan,” all participants were
paired off with partners and each
day received instructions to be

included in their “Five-Day Plant

Notebooks.” At the end of ten
weeks nearly 30 per cent of the
original» participants had not
smoked’ a cigarette for seven
days. By‘ ten months, however,

, the percentage._,was out inv half, ;

_ study in New York (1963) show-

ed that nearly 60 per cent of the
sampled smokers wished to stop
“and another study in 1963 re-
ported that only 14 per cent of
regular cigarette smokers con-
sidered the habit pleasurable,
safe and worthwhile”.

Numerous anti-smoking cam-
paigns have been instituted to
help those people who. wish to
stop, but are unable. Thompson
cites numerous “‘cures” that have
been offered such- as ,“hyn/osis,
psychoanalysis, respiratory exer-
cises, 'mouth washes, and drugs.”

‘discouraged by only a 16 per cent
cure rate,” said Dr. Thompson,
“but many less might have stop-
ped without the program Sixteen
per cent is better than none.
“The ' stop - smoking program
may not have‘ beenunique,” he

continued, “but the study made -

on this ‘Five-Day Plan’ was far
from usual. Few studies follow
a whole sample population forten
weeks and then a pre-determined
sub-sample for ten "months.”

or personnel are responsible for -
the great majority of robberies
that occur on campus. Ray said
that the police have recently ap-
prehended a suspect who account-~
ed for more than 50 purse rob- ~
beries that have oecured at Pitt. '
This suspect is also believed to
be the man who was seen sever-
al times on the women's floors of
Tower 0. i 

Thiefs on campuses, explained .

make it their business to dress 
and act just like students. -Ac- ‘
cording to Ray, (‘They get pretty I
good at it.” '

The recent crime in the alumni ‘ .
office is similar to other rob- "
beries that have occured in the
SU in the respect that the office
doors are not usually 
but are unlocked with keys. Some
of the burglars even lock the
door when they leave. This abun-
dance of keys grows out of the
fact that some room keys which
were distributed when the SU
was used for a dormitory were
never returned, according to Rob-
ert Loch, director of the SU.

Loch also said that keys are
often not returned by students?
who move out of offices in tile"-
SU. “Considering the hours Off?
Schenley Hall, the past and press
ent functions of the building, and‘
the number of offices," noted:
Loch, “the security department
is doing‘ an admirable job.”

One officer is on duty in the
SU from six in the evening to
seven in the morning, Monday"
through Friday. A guard is also
on duty from Friday at 6 ‘p.m. to.
Monday at 6 p.m. ‘

“The biggest problem in cap-_~
turing thiefs,” remarked Ray, “is
the fact that most of the thefts_
are not reported immediately}?

True Pe

The question of whether
or not the ROTC program
should be given special time
during the orientation ses-
sions and, indeed, whether
or not -this program belongs
on campus at all has recent-

'ly been raised by the Stu-

dents for Peace (SFP) and
other students, as part of an
earnest effort to attack and

. destroy anything that might

end-anger peace. This kind of
effort cannot be. attacked,
-rather it deserves praise.-
But,’ the stand of SFP on
this ROTC issue overlooks
some basic facts concerning
the place of the military in
American society and the
nature of the hour long ses-
sion held for freshmen.

The United States mili-

_,,..tary establishment is, by its

‘very nature, an integral, in-
separable part of society.
The men who serve in the
Armed Forces are not mem-

‘bers of a special class, but

are citizens who share the
same moral, political, and so-
cial values as the remainder
of society.

THE ONLY effective way
of eliminating the “entrench-
merit” of the military in
American life, which seems
to be a goal of the SFP,
would be to establish ‘a de-
tached, professional army.
This type of move, however,
could lead to the separation
of the military from the
ideals held by society in gen-
eral and, more dangerously,
the loss of control of the
military by society.

Whether one agrees with

-the idea of a citizen army or-

not and whether or not one
advocates some sort of draft
to maintai-n a strong, citizen
military, these are facts of
life which are vitally impor-
_tant to all young men in the
country.

ROTC allows the college
student a chance to serve, if
he must serve, as an officer,
rather than as a private. The
decision to enter ROTC and
whether or not one knows
that he does have the choice

~' offered by ROTC can seri-

ously affect the future of a

college student.
MILITARY SERVICE,

Wmust Abe ﬁgured in the life

 

   ROTC. In Orientation

By Dan Booker

and future of most college
students and, since this is so,
freshmen should know about

‘the choice available to them.

At orientation, the freshmen
have the right to be inform-
ed of their military obliga-
tion and then be allowed the
choice of taking ROTC or
not. _

Furthermore, the point
brought out in a recent col-
umn that the audience at the
ROTC meetings is a captive
one is false. Freshmen are
under no obligation to attend
the meetings. At the ﬁrst
orientation session, one third
of the prospective freshmen
did not attend and some of
the students walked out in
the middle of the meeting.

At the end of the meeting,
the men are asked to ﬁll out
a form indicating whether or
not they will participate in
ROTC in the fall. But, the
fact that the answer on this
form places them under no
obligation is emphasized by
the speakers and on the
form itself. The answers on
the form serve only as a
guide to let the men running
ROTC know approximately
how many students they will
have and how much supplies
they will need.

THE NEARLY universal
affects of military service on
the future of students sets
the ROTC program apart
from the other academic de-
partments.

Until the aims implied by
the name “Students for
Peace” are a -reality and as
long as the military is made
up of essentially “citizen”
soldiers, the R-OTC as a chief
organ for the maintainence
of the military cannot be
discarded.

Banner Speaks Softly,

But Carries Big Stick

By TomiSacks

Sports Editor

With all due thanks to history, Teddy Roosevelt and
Jim Banner have a lot in common. For one thing, both‘
Teddy and Pitt’s new track coach believe in talking softly.‘
And for another, both Teddy in his time and Banner in his
carry a big stick.

But unlike Teddy, Banner has no need to wield a stick
created out of steel, munitions and monies. Banner’s power
is based solely on human conviction and in its own way is
just as powerful as one based on steel.

In a conversation with Banner, you get the feeling you
have to move just a ‘little bit closer in order to hear all that
he is saying. With a mild inﬂectionvin his voice he will free-
ly tell you of his love for Pitt and his love for coaching.

“I wouldn’t trade my situation here for anything in the
world,” he tells you.

When he gets on the subject of track his voice hardens

a little bit. “I think track is the greatest sport in the world. ’ ‘

There's nothing better. Why? Because it’s man against man
and conditioning against conditioning.”

It’s in the conditioning that the coach plays the in-
tegral "part, _asserts Banner. And it’s when he is talking
about the conditioning of the trackman that you see Why
some people whisper he’s really a drill master in -disguise.

“The fun in track isn’t in training,” says Banner. “It’s

in winning. I don’t think winning is the major thing. I think I

it’s the only thing that counts. If you don’t have this atti-
tude in track then you’re lost.” ' J '
It’s when Banner talks about his formula for the Win-
_ ner that really/makes the average male shudder.

thmgs——W.0RK. WORK, AND- WORK.”

“I’m not making /any judgments, either emotional or
strategical, until I see the boys run next year. I don’t want

the 1nd1V1dual champion and occasionally the relay cham.

that potential to be a winner is in every boy we bring in ”

One of the primary roles
