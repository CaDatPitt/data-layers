Opinion Editor

Provost Rhoten Smith, hired in
- July, is living in a home provided
. by the University.

,1" The cost-of the dwelling at 717
 Amberson in Shadyside was $89,-

000. It was purchased Mayl of
 this year.

According to Ray Coble, Execu-
tive Assistant to the Chancellor,
«the policy of providing homes for
top-ranking administrators is a
traditional one. “It’s a long-
_ standing practice at this and other
 universities,” he said.

  Additionally, Coble pointed out
_. that the home did not cost stu-
dents any money. A very large
 home was given to Pitt as part
_‘ of the Epstein bequeath, said Co-
il ble, but was too large to put to
i7 use. It was sold, and part of the
I money paid for the home was al-
;;;_,located, said Coble, for the pur-
C" chase of the Provost’s residence.

_Coble said that the Provost, as
, chief academic officer, would
‘ frequently be required to use his
 house for social activities in the
;‘interest of the University. "It’s
. ‘just not fair to require a man to
[perform these duties in his own
T home,"hesaid.

Coble said that Smith has also
. been given the use of a University-
. owned Ford LTD.

.. The house and car were part of
~.  the incentive offered to Smith to

 come to Pitt, said Coble. He stat-
 ed that Smith is a top-notch ad-
 ministrator, having served as
 President at -the University of

Peace, New Priorities

Voter Registration Set

by MIKE MILLER

The Citizens ‘Registration Com-
mittee is sponsoring a voter reg-
istration rally in Point State Park
Sept. 9 to demonstrate that newly
enfranchised 18-21 year old voters
"can bring about a reordering of
American priorities and an end to
the war in Vietnam."

The committee. chaired by Den-
nis Concilla of the Pitt Student
Association. is composed of volun-
teer workers who have been can-
vassing dormitories, amusement
parks. and movie lines in an at-
tempt to encourage prospective
voters to "Register for Peace and
New Priorities." ' '

Nationally prominent speakers,
including Mayor-John Lindsay of
New York, will be featured along
with entertainment. Lindsay’s
appearance will be his first out-
side New York after he switched
parties and beca_me a Democrat.

John Kerry of the Vietnam Vet-

erans Against the War will ad- ‘

dress the rally along with Repub-
lican Congressman Donald Reigle,
of Michigan and former,Congress-
man Allard Lowenstein of New
York. '

Reigle is the only Republican to
back Democratic peace candidate

Paul McClosky.

Lowenstein, president of Amer-
icans for Democratic Action, is
also known for organizing the
“Dump Johnson” movement in
1968.

In addition, the committee hopes
to‘ have a Presidential candidate
address the rally. but no specific
speaker has as yet been named.

By getting as many young vot-
ers on the books as possible the
committee hopes to impress upon
politicians in all levels of govern-

ment that the youth ‘vs  '},'!'.‘l h«'“'” 

considerable impact on the Ame.
ican political scene.

All persons who will have at-
tained the age of 18 by Nov. 2 and
are residents of Allegheny Coun-
ty will be able to register at the
rally. They can register instead
Sept. 8 between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.
in the Student Union.

According to a Pennsylvania
state law, a person does not gain
or lose residency by living at

school. Dormitory residents from

outside of Allegheny County are
not considered county residents.

Students living in ' off-campus
housing are considered county
residents and can register.

Registrars will accept, regis-
tration from non-resident dorm
students and hold them in abey-
ance pending a court ruling or de-

C cision of the State Attorney Gen-

eral to rescind the law.

The rally will also feature en-
tertainment by John Kay and
Peter Yarrow. The committee is
negotiating for other nationally
prominent performers.

Entertainment will ‘begin at 4
p.m. and the speakers will take to
the podium at5p.m. ' l ' -

Free parking will“ be available .

at Three Rivers Stadium and a
freeiferry service will" be in op-
eration. ‘ V

 '.

Jarred by Kent State and disenchanted with poli-
.. tics, students turned inward last year. Introspection be-
came a campus fa'd—almost as popular as blue jeans
- andjoints.

, Our campus mirrored a national trend as students
. grew increasingly isolated from society. Apathy
‘reached a new height as less than 5 percent of the
.-student body voted in the Student Government elec-
"tion.

, Whether the widely-touted concern of our genera-
ff tion is gone or merely latent remains to be seen. Whe-
ther students have become selfish or just disenchanted
is the question of the year.

Actually, we are probably a campus in transition

'and“”we must hope that last year represents a pause
rather than a trend. Students needed to catch their
breath before renewing their-quest‘ for a better so-
ciety. .
I Idealism need not be the only impetus towards
involvement in campus affairs; surely, enlightened self-
interest points the same. way. Students who find the
university an impersonal monster can form friendships
'1 and other bonds by joining a campus organization or
ilimmersing themselves in a movement—-women‘s libera-
tion or a presidential campaign, for example.

Many campus organizations are struggling to sur-
vive. Many students are seeking a satisfaction that
comes only "through commitment. Do we really need
a computer to bring them together‘?

. i"Fear is not easily dispelled, and stagnation has an
inerftia all its own. But they must be vanquished, if the
 hum of excitement is to be heard again on this campus./

Students are skeptical of everyone, including fel-
--_lo,wf‘st.udents. Such skepticism is warranted and desir-
"able. But if skepticism is to be welcomed, cynicism
"must be cursed. »

V‘-‘If I were a younger man,” Kurt Vonnegut writes,
-. ‘I ‘would write a history of human stupidity; and .I
'2' would clime to the top of Mount McCabe and lie
’r"down on my back with my history for a_pillow; and I
-would climb, to the top of Mount McCabe and lie
poison that makes statues"of men; and I would make
.a statue of myself, lying on my back, grinning .horribly,
and_-thumbing my nose at You Know Who." .

_ “Too many of us have taken "Vonnegut seriously.
‘[We;_have droppediout and wallowed in despair. * -

‘ihave exalted non-involvement, without realizing that
our rhetoric is an elaborate excuse for laziness.

_JWe must admit once again that we can change.
; our campus and our nation. ‘

Over the summer, People’s Oakland, a small: but
doughty community and student group, convinced
ﬂthet University to‘ scrap its ‘expansion plans in the
 -Forbes Field area and to modify its Hillside, Dormi-
j" tory proposal. ‘ ‘

E Today, young people on this campus are laying
.. the, groundworkfor a‘ Voter Registration. Rally Septem-
— "her 9 at Point State Park, recognizing that students can
' be a decisive force in next year's presidential elections.

 --Feminists ‘here are fighting for adequate day-care
facilities and for an end to discrimination against
gjwomen. Wpmen’s liberationists are forging a new con-
"gsciousness through the Feminist Institute and informal
‘grap sessions. ‘
Will we continue to wait for Godot? Or will we
regain a sense of purpose? .
._ Students are now emerging from their caves, after

Rules and Regulations, who Needs, Them?,,,;_

by BOB BONN
Opinion Editor

There are some surprising
things happening at the Univer-
sity. , »

For example, there are courses
that you needn‘t attend to get
an A. There are classes that re-
quire just one term paper on a
topic vaguely related to the
course . . . and that's the basis
for the grade.

I

There are so few requirements
"in CA8 that it‘s possible to gradu-
ate with over half of the neces-
sary credits in "cake“ courses.

The way .all this got started
was innocent. Some teachers

decided to try some innovative"

teaching, using a greater amount
of classroom discussion than
ever before. This. they reasoned.
would stimulate learning and
make the course much more
interesting.

But it didn’t take long -before
the concept became abused.
Many students saw the relaxed
atmosphere of the classroom and
did minimal work, realizing
that they would probably get
just as high a grade anyway.

Worse, many teachers began
to see that the use of innova-
tive teaching techniques would
greatly lessen their workload,
so they began to get lazy too.

 

 

It seems like the concept of
few requirements in courses and
lots of class-room discussion is
an idealistic one. and that the
lazy nature of human beings in-
evitable messes up the system.

While some teachers sincerely
try to use the concept to the

fullest and some students do
learn," too many simply get
away with ‘as little as possible
and end up accomplishing
nothing. ’

Another trick some students
use _is to take advantage of the
liberalized graduation require-
ments. Freshman English and
foreign languages are no’ longer
necessary, for example.

While it is true that such
studies are of little use or in-
terest to a few students, the vast
majority could profit from them.

Yet registration in these
courses has dropped off consider-
ably since the requirements
ended. '

Re-establishment of such rules
in this case would be a mistake,
as some students _ simply don’t
have need for the courses. Yet
it should be strongly emphasized
that the courses are ofvalue,
and students should be encourag-
ed to takethem any way.

So while retr'a_cing steps aca-

. demically is always unpleasant,

Sumpthiifs Not Happenin’ Here...

it may be time for teachers,
advisors, and students to do so_.
While this reporter can never
encourage strict regulations just
because “a little work never
hurt anybody." I also feel that
there is something to be gained

from a re-examination of ‘ thel

purpose for taking a class.

Suggestion: Give Pitt the-Streets

In recent weeks a lot of de-
mands ‘have been "made upon

the University of Pittsburgh.
Peoples Oakland and the City
have demanded that the Uni-
versity not expand past the
Forbes Field area into South
Oakland; and if I’ve read my
Pitt -News correctly, the Uni-
versity has agreed to this de-
mand.

Also. Peoples: Oakland has
demanded that they have a voice
in how the University is to de-
velop Forbes‘ Field. Again
agreement. It seems that, if fair
play is to be "observed. it should
now be the Un_iversity‘s turn. to
make demands upon Peoples
Oakland an-d the City." We have
given up our much needed ex-
pansion, what now must they"
giveusinreturn? ' _

The answer to this question
is related to another more
general one; “what is_ there,
which is within "the power of

  

 

the City or Peoples Oakland to
give, which will in any way
benefit the University?" There
are probably a number of ans-
wers to this question.

One answer which pops to
mind would remove what I be-
lieve to be the biggest detri-
ment to the intellectual atmos-

phere of this place; namely,
Fifth Avenue, Forbes Avenue,
Bigelow Boulevard, and ' the

numerous other. streets which
criscross campus. ,

If the University'were to-say
to the City and Peoples Oak-
land, "we will agree to forfeit
our further expansion into South‘
Oakland, if. (and only if) _you
will agree, to re-route. the three
streets on our campus and will
sell us those lands," it would-
seem that they must agree be-
cause such an agreement would‘
benefit all sides.

The University’ will benefit

 

because this is land.. Land on "

which one can build buildings,
park cars, and (hopefully)
plant grass and trees. The City
and Peoples Oakland will bene-
fit in that it is land which will
not have to be taken off ‘the

tax rolls, and which will relieve 
the need to expand into South" 

Oakland. 4

But the final, most import-
ant, benefit is that it will re-
move from our campus some- of
the noise and distraction of
the city; thus helping to ‘create
a quiet atmosphere befitting a
great. University.

Because then that this an-
swer, for these reasons, seems

fair to all concerned;,I would

like to recommend that’ the
University “demand” this; and-

I hope such anfarrangement"-~

will be agreed upon. _
_ Sincerely yours,

Commuters Wonder

Parking: Empty Promises or upcoming Kéality?  - 

by TOM GAINAN
Commuter Association
President

A commitment has been
made by the administration
to"provide more parking for
commuting students this year.
But will the University fulfill
its pledge or will this be just

another empty promise?

On March 31, 1-5 members of
the Commuter Association CA)
met with Chancel- ‘ "
lor Posvar and oth-
er administrators
to discuss commut-
er problems. The
. . Chancellor w a s
' very sympathetic
 to the needs of the
, ' commuters and .
' made a very strong commitment
to work toward bettering condi-
tions for Pitt’s non-resident ma-
jority—especially in the area of
parking. The Chancellor directed
_ that, the Panther Hollow lot be
leased from"the B&O Railroad,
‘that the Katsur ‘Lot be improved,
,,that a new lot be built behind
-,.Trees Hall, and that the Univer-
_ sity look for new space to be us-
.‘ - 2 ed.for'.par-king. .,
' The_ :was told that approxi-
 mately 425 total spaces would be
-. ..availab.l_e to students September,
1971. This figure was significant
because it was more than double
the amount of University-controll-
ed parking available to commut-
ers -last year.

The Chancellor’s committment

must be commended, but com- ,

muters reserve the right to be
_skeptical about the number of
spaces that actually will be
available.

Last April the CA was told by
one administrator, “You’ve got
to keep your organization active
during ‘Itheg summer. months be-
cause that’s the time the admin-

 -istration "can get things done.”
 Des'pit_e-"the fact that the..CA-
I- '.keptj_act~_ive, the administration-
- ‘did little" to get the lots ready.

Although the organization was

told that the. University was at- '

   

tempting to get permission to
build the Trees Lot, a check with
City Planning revealed no build-
ing permit request had been fil-
ed. The CA immediately sent a
letter’ to the Chancellor, and
shortly thereafter the official ap-
plication was filed.

As it looks now, community
opposition will probably cause
City Planning to refuse the Trees
Lot. Nonetheless, the CA re-
gards this administrative “over-
sight“ with suspicion.

There have been other gaps
in the administration's credibil-
ity this summer. The reply to the
.CA’s letter; sent by Vice Chan-
cellor Edison Montgomery. in-
formed the group that prospects
for the Trees Lot looked bad. but
that 400 spaces would neverthe-
less be available because the Kat-
sur Lot had been expanded.

Later, during 3 meeting With =='_lIlIIlIllIlll|IIlIIIIIIIIIIIIIllIIllIIIllllIlllllIIllllllllillllllllllllllgl

cial of the Physical Plant de-

information they had previouslyg

given him was incorrect. Not
only had the Katsur Lot not been
expanded, but 50 existing spaces
had beentaken from students and
given to faculty. The Vice Chan-
cellor" was somewhat ‘surprised
to learn this,‘ and he immediately
reinstated the 50 spaces to stu-
dent use. A

. The latest communication from
the administration maintains that
410 spaces—nearly the number
promised by the Chancellor—
will be available by mid-Septem-
ber. These include 140 in the
Katsur Lot, 85 in the existing
Panther Hollow Lot, and 185 in
a new lot in Panther Hollow.

This latest promise seems close
to completion since the existing
Panther’ Hollow Lot has been
slagged and negotiations have

begun for the new one. Howev--

er, one discrepancy still remains
—how many spaces are there‘?
The administration said 85. but
the highest student estimate is
about 50. And will the new ‘lot
really hold 185 cars?

,In addition, the CAS has been
promised that if the new Panth-
er Hollow lot is not ready by

bably good, but the red tape ne-
cessary to get anything done has
turned this summer's parking
quest in.to a comedy of errors.

lt‘s ridiculous when one depart-‘

ment does not know what an-
other is doing.

And when some bureaucrats
can act contrary to a directive
from the Chancellor (i.e. the as-
signing of 50 spaces in the ‘Kat-
sur Lot. to faculty), it‘s criminal.
After a while, students do not
know whom to believe.

In addition to the 400 spaces
for this September, the admin-
istration has promised a signi-
ficant amount of new space in
the future. In lieu of the Trees
Lot, we will get 200 spaces in
the Cemetary Lot on Allequippa
Street. This should be ready by
January, 1972. There is also a
good possibilitysof some 250 spa-
pes in Forbes Field when the

ballpark demolition is finally
completed.

University Center Offers Free iHelpif

I Counseling: Sensitivity To Students

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

By the end of her third week
at the University of Pittsburgh,
Jane Henry, a freshman from
New Jersey, has decided to trans-
fer to a New Jersey college. She
misses her family and friends;
the two months until Thanksgiv-
ing -vacation seem interminable.
She finds nothing attractive about
Pitt. Studying and socializing,
even during meals, are difficult.
Embarrassed, she hesitates to tell
anyone her problem. A college
freshman, in her opinion, is too
old to be homesick. '

Tom Brown is worried about
his future. In eight months he
will graduate with a B.A. in so-
ciology. With_the tight job mark-

“ et, he knows he will have diffi-

culty finding employment. Should
he go to graduate school? Law
school? Should he explore other
fields‘? Who can he ask for ad-
vice?

The University has free help

facilities for both students. Eight -

professionals trained in psychol-
ogy and career counseling are
available"at the University Coun-
seling Center on the second floor
of the Student Union to advise
or listen to a student. l

According to Dr. Robert Galla-
gher, Director of the Counseling
Center, a student’s emotional
state affects ‘this power of con-
centration, his openness for learn-
ing and remembering academic
material, his attitudes toward
schoolwork, and his adjustment
to_ the complexities of this en-
vironment." Therefore the per-
sonnel never consider any stu-
dent’s problem minute or unim-
portant. ’

Gallagher said the counselors

help students with problems rang-
ing from homesickness, pre-mari-
tal fears, post-abortion guilt feel-
ings, and problems with room-
mates, to graduate school and
fellowship advice. A student com-
ing to the Center is given an hour
with a counselor and may return
as often as three or four times.
though usually students requir-
ing long-term counseling are re-
ferred to the Student Health
Center or another outside agency.

    

Dr. Robert Gallagher, Director,
‘University Counseling Center.

Four members of the staff are
doctoral level psychologists train-
ed as generalists to deal with
problems ranging from a simple
adjustment problem to a serious
emotional disturbance. They are
Dr. Warren T. Hill, Dr. Tom
Schlesinger, Dr. Penny Crary,
and Dr. Gallagher. There are also
two counseling interns, Ms. Law-
rencella Wright and ’Mr. David
Griffin, who in addition to their
regular counseling duties handle
the special problems of black stu-
dents. ’

This year the career counsel-
ing services have been expanded.
The services are being coordinat-

‘ed by Ms. Tedie Fakles of the

Career Planning Division of the
Counseling Center.

A new addition to the career
planning services is that of grad-
uate school advising, formerly
handled by the PESO of_fice. Ms.
Pat Roberts, the new graduate
school advisor, has assumed the
responsibility of collecting let-
ters of recommendation for stu-
dents. Letters filed by students
will be photocopied and sent to
the graduate schools and fellow-
ship committees.

Ms. Roberts will counsel stu-
dents on fellowships they may be
eligible for.
also cooperate with the Univer-

' sity Committee for National and

International Fellowships and
scholarships in nominating stu-
dents for such awards as the’
Rhodes Scholarship and the Dan-
forth Foundation Award.

Ms. Roberts will also help stu-
dents prepare statements and re-
sumes for their applications.

A Career Information Spe-
cialist, Ms. Marti Moore. has
been hired to advise students on
job trends and opportunities. '

Two Career Seminars will be
sponsored by the Counseling Cen-
ter this year. Over 200 profes-
sionals from various fields includ-
ing law, medicine. and commun-
ications will be on campus sev-
eral days in October_ and Febru-
ary to talk with st_t_1dents about
their fields.

Several other career-advising
programs are being planned. One

It also said the allegations were
“for the most part, a collection of
untoward experiences which some
of the UCWR members have had,
but in most instances they pre-
dated UCWR’s campus activity or
could not be reasonably connected
with such activity."

However, HEW stated Pitt was
guilty on two charges, saying that
“two women have been denied
equal pay and promotional oppor-
tunities and inequality is based
upon sex anddoes appear to tie in
with their UCWR involvement.”

Pitt was ordered to make resti-
tution by paying back salaries to
Rubel and Roberts. It also rein-
stated Roberts to a position com-
parable to her former job.

cil on Women's Opportunities
'(ACWO), an advisory group ap-
pointed by the Chancellor in the
spring of 1970 to study the prob-
lems of and opportunities for
women at the University.

or Equality

Advocates of the proposal were
Marcia Landy, principal author
of the proposal and member of
the English department and Dean
Jerome Schneewind of the College
of Arts and Sciences.

The proposal calls for the hiring
of a core faculty of no less than
five feminists and the additional
hiring of faculty from other de-

\

partments within the University
on a part-time basis.

The program would be divided
between teaching and research of
problems and issues. The propos-

_ al states that faculty and students

will be encouraged to examine
family sex roles, child care pro-
grams, and other social problems.

New Assistant i',I‘o Chancellor

, B lakely Seeks Equa

By KATHY MCCANN

The University has contended
lately with charges of discrimin-
atory treatment of its female

* members. , —

Aimed at eliminating. such
practices within the University,
Pitt’s ‘Affirmative Action pro-
gram has acquired new direction

Blakely.
News Photo.

in the person of Dr. Edward
Blakely, recently appointed As-
sistant to the Chancellor.

Eager to establish social equi-
ty, Dr. Blakely accepted his po-

-sition at the University because

he “felt the opportunity here to
contribute to social change.”

The best way to bring about
social change, Blakelymaintains,
is to know what you want to ac-
hieve and to assist those-people
who share.'your goals but don’t
have the expertise to get there.

According to Dr. Blakely, he

and his staff have undertaken a
complete audit with each~admin-
istrative unit to discern problems
in the areas of affirmative’ ac-
tion. Equipped with the-results
of these audits, they will aid
each department in working out
programs ‘to achieve equitable
status as far-as the employment,
training , and development of
women and other minority groups
are concerned.

“_Most departments will -be ea-

_ger to‘-be assisted in the develop-
ment-"in such programs,” said .

Blakely. “Given” a. list of quali-
fied candidates for _a position,
most administrators would take
advantage of it.”

His office intends to publish,

a bulletin on affirmative action,
a dissertation on federal law and
university policy. Blakely’s phil-
osophy is: “Once armed with in-

formation, people will act on our;

behalf.”

Previous to his arrival at Pitt,
Blakely spent five years in the
anti-poverty program as the Ex-

ecutive Director of a large tech- T

nical consultant firm, active in
training community action work-
ers.

Most recently, he served at the
University of California, mobiliz-
ing for urban action.

Ron Cowell, formerly Assist-

‘ant Director of Housing, was re-

cently named to ‘head the newly
organized Off‘-Campus Housing
Office. '

The Office carries listings of
rooms, apartments, and houses
for rentor sale.’ while also sup-
-plying‘information and assistance
to present and prospective stu-
dent tenants. -

Cowell stated that at this time
he has three major objectives.
The first of these is “to increase
listings of available living quar-
ters, to make it easier for stu-
dents to locate off campus ac-
comodations," he said.

Cowell "pointed out
though many landlords inform

' the Office of available housing,

many others do not, or are un-
aware that. they -may do so. Co-
well mentioned a number of
methods for remedyingthis pro-
blem.

“We may call up landlords
who have previously listed with
us,” he said, also noting the im-
portance of contacting those who
had not, to inquire as to av-
ailable space. Cowell noted that
‘ads from local newspapers may
also prove useful in this respect.

Another aim of the Off—Cam-
pus Housing Office is to "as-
sist those students who have
complaints, such as discrimina-
tion and alleged violations of
health and safety regulations,

for example," Cowell stated.

He conceded that the Office
“cannot formally file the com-
plaint; the student himself must
do this.” However, the Off—Cam-

being planned "for landlord edu-

well, are intended to foster bet-

At 1971 Orientation if

Frosh Get Involved

by JOEL HURWITZ

The title on the orientation
manual, "Involvement." was the
primary objective of the 1971
session, according to Rick Box.
Chairman of Undergraduate Or-
ientation. ’

“We want this freshman class
to be the most involved of any
that has entered the University,"
Box stated. '

The 1971 Freshman Orien-

— tation. held August 25 through

September 1. marked the longest
and most comprehensive under-
graduate orientation to date.
The session. in which attendance
was optional for all freshmen,
combined the traditionally sep-
arate Mentor and Orientation
programs.

The Mentor program pre-
viously assigned freshman groups
to upperclass "advisors"' with
whom they met during the fall
term while past orientations
consisted of an introduction to
the University with registration
appointments interspersed
throughout the activities. The
combination of these two pro-

grams marked arl attempt to per-_

sonalize orientation
greater social
the Mentor groups.

and gain
benefits from

This year’s concept in orien-
tation, procedures is the latest
step in an evolutionary move-
ment which began in 1970. _

Last ‘year, the orientation com-
mittee headed by Carl Van Horn
abolished practically all atten-
dance restrictions and created
an environment in which fresh-

men could freely pursue areas’

of personal interest. The social
schedule was also expanded to
include a movie, a coffee house

‘ and many informal parties.

On the opening, night of orien-
tation, approximately 800 fresh-
men assembled in Trees Hall for
a “Get Acquainted Evening."
This evenings activities consist-

ed of a series of light sensiti-
vi_ty mingling exercises design-

ed for the eventual formation of
Mentor groups’.

These Mentor groups then met
during orientation andare to
continue meeting at various in-
tervals throughout the Fall
‘term. -The abbreviated sensitivi-

: 2   ctnsslrnsn

ty session was followed by man-
datory floor meetings con-
ducted by‘ Resident Assistants
for all dormitory students:

. Daily orientation programs
consisted of presentations by
major campus organizations and
interest groups. The most unique
recruitment effort involved free
helicopter rides sponsored by
Air Force ROTC. The evening
social schedules were highlight-
ed by the traditional orientation
dance, a performance by “the
Amazing Kreskin,” various mov-
ies and fraternity _parties.

' When questioned as to wheth-
er the present orientationwas
relevant to student needs. Rick
Box commented, "We are tem-
porarily keeping pace, but more
changes need to be made for
next year." Some of the chang-
es Box cited included better co-
ordination between the Orienta-
tion Committee and the schools
of the University. a separation of
registration from orientation pro-
cedures and a combination of the
"June Weekend" (commuter or-
ientation during the early sum-
mer) phase with the August or-
ientation program.

The problem of maintaining
relevance in orientation pro-
gramming remains secondary to
the larger financial problems
which plagued this years or-
ientation and could significant-
ly alter future sessions. Although
funds were more than adequate
last spring, an organizational
budget cancellation May 1 sud-
denly plunged the program into
a fiscal bind which necessitated
substantial cuts in housing for
hosts and hostesses.

With the current financial
status and the questionable pri-
ority-which orientation maintains
is student activities, the future
remains cloudy. Even more un-

certain is the future of the Men- .

tor groups. Social Commission-
er Lenny Klavonic has frozen
funds for this year pending a
successful evaluation of the
Mentor program.

The outcome of the orientation
was, according to Rick Box,
"successful in terms of our ob-
jectives. We have pushed in-
volvement and the comments

from student organizations have
been very good. We were really
successful in getting everyone
together." Box's appraisal is sup-
ported by the participation in
various scheduled activities.

The opening night parents’ re-
ception, a loser in the past, drew
an estimated 550 parents. The
dance, which has also been a
lukewarm item in previous years,
drew the largest crowd in four
years, and Kreskin literally
“freaked out” a packed house
in Lawrence Hall. The movies,
parties, etc. -also enjoyed simi-
lar success.

 Pitt, Oakland, city Finally

Hampered somewhat by its
smallness, the group was also
plagued by a shortage of cash
and charges thatrit never truly
represented the Oakland com-
munity.

Financial woes were eased
somewhat when Walt Boykowicz,
a teacher of architectural de-
sign at Carnegie-Mellon Uni-
versity and a member of Peoples

Oakland, was placed on the pay-

roll of the City Planning De-
partment. The City and the Uni-
versity pay Boykowicz’s salary.

Group members gradually
grew inured to the persistent
charges of .misrepresentation.
"Of course there are mixed
feelings in the community,”
said Kim Fellner, a Peoples
Oakland member. She added
that group members
made real attempts to inform
Oakland residents of all events.

GOOD FENCES,
GOOD NEIGHBORS

Despite its lack of resources .

and late entry into the fray,
Peoples Oakland was able to
persuade the University to radi-
cally change its plans for the
Hillside Dorms. Those plans are
now being redrawn. by the Uni-

versity with community . ad- ’
vice. -
"Until Montgomery’s stunning

revelation in late July, the Uni-
versity had balked at altering
its Forbes area design to meet
Peoples Oakland objections.

Peoples’ Oakland argued tlfat
the University plans, if com-
pleted, would impair traffic in
Oakland, depersonalize the life

styles’ and environment of the

neighborhood, -and smooth the
way for construction of Forbes
Phases II-IV in the manner
previously blueprinted by the
University—that is, without com-
munity input. '

‘Peoples Oakland architects

,Richard Brittain, Troy West,

and Boykowicz devised their
own plan for the rehabilitation
of Forbes Field,_ calling for.
classroom space, a farmer’s mar-
ket, and open areas for use by
the University and the com-
munity.

“We tried ‘to deal with the
problems of interface," explain-
ed Boykowicz. Interface would
allow mutual and presumably

. affable use of facilities by the

community and Pitt, a concept
based on “ the belief that good
fences indeed make tood neigh-
bors. .

“have.

“The meetings," said Boyko-
wicz, "have essentially been a
forum, a place to air ideas.”

“We are sort of advisors who
need not constrain the adminis-
tration,” he said.

Fellner, a graduatestudent in
communications at Pitt, concur-
red.

“Their (the tripartite meet-
ings) importance is more related
to the fact that communication
has taken place, rather than
what has resulted.”

“-The-House of Thrills” . . .

She further described the
meetings as “power-parrying”
a show of “who can outmaneu-
ver whom when.”

SHIFTING WINDS

If the meetings at first foster-
ed little cooperative effort, the
University should not be por-

trayed as monster or. maneuver-

er——it was as much a victim as
manipulator of changing circum-
stances.

Around .a decade ago, when
University visionaries first de-

‘veloped the idea of a Master

Plan forPitt’s expansion, it did
not seem particularly pressing
for them to consult the com-
munity they‘ were planning to
_displace. Progress was Progress,
and no one imagined an irate
community. would brace itself
against Forbes’ ivy-mottled

walls and battle Progress’ bull-_'.

dozers with sticks and stones.
“It was easier,” speculated

Boykowicz, “to conceive of an

urban renewal scheme ' that
wiped out an enti-re area that, to
a dispassionate eye, seemed un-
fit to live in."

Forbes Field

Following a detailed study
by its own architects, the Uni-
versity rejected the plan, claim-
ing that it would be more ex-
pensive to rehabilitate Forbes
than it would be to tear it down

and build the Community’s
plans from scratch.

ing the City shifted with him.
“We must place a moratorium
on the growthand expansion
of tax exempt institutions,“ said
the maverick Democratic Mayor.

“The Commission will con-
sider no further applications for
University expansion until
there is sufficient community
input to the planning process,"
said John’ Bitzer. chairman of
the City Planning Commission.

And there was the University,
a tax-exempt, expansion bound
institution that had cultivated no
community suggestions for its ex-
pansion scheme.

Well. even if the University‘s
plan flew in the face of the
new Mayor‘s new directives,

All was still a sophisticated, well-

formulated plan, unrivalled by
anything the community could
muster on such short notice. ‘It
was hardly possible for a co-
operative plan to be hammered

“A COMMUNITY THERE”

Understandably, the Univer-
sity clung tenaciously to its
much-maligned plan. Its dele-
gates laboriously pointed out the
time and money spent on the
plan, the time and money all the
delays were costing, and the
time and money necessary to
junk the plan in favor of a co-
operative effort.

Yet, for all its alleged intran-
sigence, the University was pa-
tient, if uneasy, and open to
suggestion. I

partite meetings, said the Uni-

“They’ve been rather

Early in the talks, Montgom-
ery said that the Phase I pro-

an acceptable alternative and
one with financial backing could
be found. The- non-negotiable
proposal was _negotiated
five months, and eventually drop-

“There has been a change in ‘

the nature of the representation
of the community,” he said.
“.It’s not representing itself
rather than being represented
by government agents.”

As one would expect on an
issue that cut so close to the
core, the discussions had their
irrational moments. Martin
said he could distinguish two
segments of community repre-
sentation—a “radical element
that makes noise, applauds, and
cheers,” and “another element,
a profound, intelligent,
group of people.”

At a tripartite session July

They made noise. They applaud-
ed. They cheered.

lllakeliood Fences, Good Neighbors -

At the July 16 meeting, Pater-
noster revealed the City’s posi-
tion on the University's expan-
sion plans. He said that, should

University architects decide
to transcend Pitt’s ' current
boundaries, they “will subject

themselves to a careful scrutiny -

by the City.”

He added that any such move‘

would be expected to contain
significant community input.
Since the Phase I plan forced
“Pitt to acquire new land,
City would presumably have
given great credence to com-
munity objections.

So_me Peoples Oakland mem-
bers seem to believe that when
the University submitted, it
yielded to City and/or State
pressure, rather than to any in-_

terest in the welfare of the
community.
“The, pressure they’re re-

sponding to is not the com-
munity,” said Fellner.

“They’re responding to pres-
sure, not to any major restruc-

turing of the ideology of the

administration,” said

wicz.

Martin conceded that in addi-
tion to the new community, the
University was “also responding

ment. " x
“The new government has

said, ‘There are new rules un-

der which you’re going to

PHOENIX FOR FUTURE?

So the game has new rules
and new teams who, strangely
enough, will pitch in to scuttle

a ball park. Though joint plan- ,

ning sessions have begun, what

will go in Forbes’ stead is less’
— clear.

‘The University has pledged
that it will acquire no more
cemmunity land. Given the new
City ‘guidelines and the drama
and notoriety of this.c'onfron-
tation, future University develop-
ments that effect the community
will almost assuredly include
community input. -

New Rules

The University has also es-
tablished two critical parameters
for the cooperative plans-first,
they must budget as much class-
room space as was originally
planned, and, second, Univer-
sity or GSA educational funds
will only finance academic
endeavors.

The currency of joint plan-
ning, though,_-is trust; not too
long ago, the University was
bankrupt. Five months of .talks
may have enabled the Univer-

sity and the community to
learn what the other is about.
“I .think I’m beginning to «

understand better what the com-

munity is saying," said Hunt
Martin. » . "

“I think it‘s . . . a new atmos-

  Freeze Threatens Fee  

President Nixon’s wage and price freeze may invalidate the Uni-
versity’s recent Activities Fee hike.

Should that occur, the Allocations Committee of the Student Asso-
ciation (SA), which administers the fees to student organizations, will
not have enough money to cover its allocations.

A $4 raise in the fee. recommended by the committee in the spring,
was approved by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Bernard Kobosky
and the Board of Trustees well in advance of the Presidents new eco-
nomic measures. 0

' The fact that the new rate did not takeeffect until the beginning of
this term, however, has Pitt officials wondering whether this hike and

a boost in the price of the Student Health Insurance rates will be allowed.

Bill Markus, director of Student Activities, said that until a rul-
ing is obtained from the Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP) no
further requests for funds will be considered by the Allocations Com-
mittee.

0 The committee has already pledged nearly $250,000 to student or-
ganizations and without the additional $60,000-$75,000 expected to be

raised by the activities fee increase it will not be able to meet those

pledges. Assistant Director of Student Activities Bill Lonaghan esti-
mated that the committee would fall $25,000 short without the increase.
‘ If the OEP voids the increase, the University would presumably be

0 obligated to return to $4 to each student who paid the fee, although it

,-

might choose to grant credit toward the payment of next.term’s fee.
' ALLOCATIONS
' Throughout the spring and summer, the committee and the SA So-

cial Commission reviewed the budgets of student organizations. The S0-

cial Commission retained the right to reject any recommendation by
the committee, the ultimate legislative power being held by the four

PHEAA, Haverfordl Agree 

by RUDY TORBICH

An agreement, concerning two
Pennsylvania laws depriving dis-
ruptive college students of State
financial aid was reached last
Monday between Haverford Col-
lege and the Pennsylvania Higher
Education Assistance Agency
(PHEAA).

Only students convicted of a fe-
lony are now ineligible for State
aid. Colleges and universities
must report such students under a
reporting agreement to maintain
college eligibility for student fi-
nancial aid.

A. U.S. District Court in Phil-
adelphia, in a 2-1 decision last
July, struck down three sections,
each in two 1969 Pennsylvania
statutes that denied scholarships
and loans to students:

—Convicted of a felony or a mis-
demeanor involving “moral tur-
pitude.”

—Expelled or denied enrollment
for refusing to obey “alawful
regulation of any institution of
higher education.’_’

—-Convicted in any court of public
record for disrupting or inter-
fering with the orderly conduct
of any institution of higher ed-
ucation.

“The term ‘moral turpitude,"
read the court’s opinion written
by Judge Joseph S. Lord, III,
"tells us very little about what
misdemeanors trigger the loss of
financial aid eligibility. . . . If the
State insists on legislating’ moral-
ity, we will insist, at least,‘ that it
spell out its moral code, particu-
larly where those affected by the

‘ statute are of a different_genera-

tion from the lawmakers and gen-
erally share a different outlook on
what is and what is not moral."

The Court also pointed out that
it was impossible for a student- to
know what an institution would
consider a disruption. "This sub-
section cannot constitutionally
stand in the face of such manifest
indefiniteness . . 

‘The hazy terms ‘-‘disturb” and
“interfere” written into the laws‘
could include student activities
which are ‘constitutionally pro-
tected, decided the court. This
section “. . . invades the area of

  

 

      

First Amendment freedoms, it is
unconstitutionally overboard . . .”
said the report.

The agreement was reached by
"consent decree" in which the
plaintiff met and worked out the
decision with the PHEAA. The
agreement‘ will become perma-
nent, by a court order, on Oct. 15,
if no objections are raised before
that time.

The original court action was
taken against the PHEAA by Hav-
erford College,‘ Goddard College,
and 12 students. They were sup-
ported in “friend-in-court" briefs
by 31 colleges, the U.S. National
Student Association, and the
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors.

Three reasons for the court"ac-
tion were given by Walter Balt-
hazer. a Haverford representa-
tive: ‘

—The laws turned colleges into in-
vestigative agencies by means
that were both improper an
coercive. V

—They violated an understanding
with the students that internal
discipline matters were confi-
dential.

as Vice Chancellor. Peake, who
came to Pitt with Edward Litch-
field in 1956, helped ease the pain
of transition for Dr. Posvar when
he arrived on campus in 1967." A
top-notch recruiter, Peake at-
tracted many outstanding faculty
members to Pitt under Litchfield,
Kurtzman, and Posvar.

The third staff member, Vice

Chancellor for Finance Edison
Montgomery, has resigned to be-

i come Assistant Vice Chancellor

of the Health ‘Professions. Mont-
gomery,.who has handled the Uni-
vers'rty‘s finances through stormy
weather, found his post “was los-
ing its element of fun.”

Replacing Freeman as "Execu-
tive Assistant to the Chancellor is
Ray Coble, a Political Scientist
from the Air Force Academy who
has been a close associate of Dr.
Posvar.

Rhoten Smith, former President
of Northern Illinois University,
replaces Peake as Provost. The
Provost, currently in charge of
the University’s academic sector,
may soon have expanded respon-
sibilities, if the Chancellor de-
cides to place the Student Affairs
area under the Provost’s jurisdic-
tion. I »

The Vice-Chancellor for Fi-
nance Office has been abolished
and supplanted by an Office of
Operations and an Office of Plan-

ning and Budget. Joseph Dutton,_

Jr. has been hired as Vice Chan-
cellor for Operations. A Vice
Chancellor for Planning and Bud-
get has yet to be appointed, al-
though a search committee is cur-
rently hunting _one.

confidence and trust.”

Coble was an instructor" in Political Sci-
ence at the U.S. Air Force Academy when '
Posvar was head of the department.

The new assistant outlined the duties of his
office as “an extention of the Chancellor; to
act'as a strong right arm,” helping to keep
him well informed of the needs and problems
of the University. It is his responsibility to
“get correct information to the Chancellor

quickly,” said Coble.

Coble pointed out that the Chancellor is ex-
tremely busy and faces a myriad of problems.
The assistant “digests the facts without color-
ing them and presents them to him (Pos-

var) ," he stated.

However, Coble stressed that he himself
is not a policy maker. “Itis not my function
to impose my own philosophy upon the Chan- .
cellor, but tohelp objectively,” hesaid. Nev-
ertheless, Coblevdoes not consider his own

position a passive one.

Coble explained that he may try to assist
the Chancellor in solving problems and make
recommendations to him. He alsoalsserted
that the Chancellor_ is extremely concerned
with the creation of new programs and oppor-
tunities. “We are constantly examining and
evaluating,” Coble added. ‘ ‘

The new assis--
tant is “intimately
concerned with the
outcome of the fi-
nancial delibera-
tions of the Univer-
sity,” he said, not-
ing the importance
of the stewardship
of the Chancellor.
Posvar, according
to Coble, “has done
a great deal in re-
reducing external
debt."

Coble is also in-
terested in the joint
planning for
Forbes Field, try-
ing to get the four
parties — the Com-

monwealth, the City, the University, and the peopl
——to cooperate with one another. He expressed con
cern regarding the consolidation of various com
munity groups in favor of collective interests.

Also, Bernard Kobosky, Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs,
was named Vice Chancellor for
Public Affairs, a new position. In-
stead of appointing a Vice Chan-
cellor for Student Affairs, Chan-
cellor Posvar has asked a special
committee to consider ways of
revamping Student Affairs, pos-
sibly placing it under the jurisdic-
tion of the Provost. In the mean-
time, Kobosky is functioning as
Vice Chancellor for Student Af-
fairs and Vice Chancellor for Pub-
lic Affairs.

a new Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs raised eyebrows over the
summer, because'Kobosky urged
Posvar to name Dan_McFadden,

would be presump

any future changes.

Dutton said that
the problems he
had encountered at
Boston University,
where he served
as Business Man-
ager and then as
Acting Vice Presi-
dent for Business Affairs.

He conceded that the history ‘of such problems '_
would be different here, since Pitt is a public uni-
versity with the resulting political strings attached
to its functions,..while Boston University is essen-
tially a private institution. .

One area which deeply distresses Dutton, he
said, is Pitt’s financial‘ dilemma. Speaking of the
State Legislatures $40.5 million appropriation" to
Pitt, an amount much less than that requested by
Chancellor Posvar, Dutton stated that the lack of
funds would probably result in a cutback of services.

However, he would not say which services and
departments would suffer, prefering to wait untilhe

versity were dealt a setback when the University ,

Senate voted todo away with the two-day election
recess it approved a year ago. .

Last year, Pitt suspended classes on election

day and the preceding day to allow students time

to work in political campaigns. The time was made
up later in the academic calendar.

The Senate cited lack of student interest as its
main reason for scuttling the recess, pointing to -a
survey taken by the Citizenship Information Center

Activities Fee H iked

A cool Pittsburgh spring warmed up consider-
ably when SA Commissioners Lenny Klavonic and
Wade Lawson sought an increase in the Student

Activities Fee, salaries for themselves and other
SA officials based on their own estimations of their
worth, and the replacement of SA advisor Bill
Markus.

Some outraged students scurried to the SA Con-
stitution in search of impeachment procedures and
were surprised to learn that, until January, there
are none. The Constitution states that outgoing Com-
missioners shall comprise the adjudicatingbody in
impeachment hearings. Since this is the SA’s ini-
tial year, there are no former Commissioners.

When the din finally cleared, a procedure for
raising the Activities Fee was established, salaries
for SA-officials talked down, and Markus‘ position
solidified.‘ '-

According to the new procedure, an increase in
the Activities Fee will occur no more than once a
"year when it is recommended by the Allocations
Committee and approved by the Commissioners,
the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, and the
Board of Trustees.

Almost immediately, the Allocations Committee
proposed to hike the‘, Fee from $8 to $12. The propos-

H al was okayed by the Commissioners, Bernard Ko-

bosky, and the Trustees, and went into effect this
term.

SA Personnel Resign

The turmoil in the SA was not without repercus-
sions. -

"‘Even an Abe Lincoln would have problems with
the present -system,” said SA Financial Director
Bob Lederman of the student government.

Lederman decided that his problems with it
were insufferable and, on April 29, he resigned.
He said that,he could ". . . no longer tolerate the

lack of integrity which .' . . prevails in the operation

of this form of government.”

Lederman’.s resignation was followed three
weeks later by the resignation of Legal Awareness
Committee (LAC) Chairman Bob Ging. Ging claim-
ed that relations between Committees Commission-
er Wade Lawson and the LAC were hampered by a
.lack of “downward communication."

“We have no autonomy whatever,” said Ging.
“Wade wants to be Committees Commissioner and
chairman of all the committees a-t the same time.”

Ging, who likened the SA administration to “a
dictatorship,’_’ was also miffed at Lawson’s handling
of a bail bond fund proposed by the SA.

Lederman and Ging were joined in mid-August
by _SA Secretary Barbara Goldberg. “It is hard to
maintain my self-respect,” she said in her letter
of resignation, “in a situation where one of my em-
ployers takes unfair advantage of the fact that he is
my employer and uses this factor as leverage to
make my job more difficult.”

Goldberg also said that “. . . as.a woman many
of the demands that have been made upon me in the
job have made it difficult for me to maintain a wom-
an’s dignity.”

Goldberg said she was repeatedly asked by
Committees Commissioner Wade Lawson to type
his termpapers and do paper work for the Black
Action Society.

that Goldberg was permitted to resign because the
.Commissioners were dissatisfiednwith her work.

FASC.»Approves Reforms
The Faculty of-Arts and Sciences Council ap-
proved in May a motion limiting all departmental

‘ credit requirements to 40 and extending the numbe:

of‘ credits a student may take in one department"
from 40 to 60. - ' r - -

In other academic reforms, the College of Arts
and Sciences Council has extended the period in
which students may exercise the credit/no entry
-option. Students will now have to the 15th class day
of each term (three weeks after the beginningof
classes), to turn in the cards. Previously, only two
weeks were permitted. - ' .

College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) students will\
also have an easier time adding or dropping courses ‘i
this term. CAS students no longer. need their advi- ‘
sors’ signatures on drop/add forms; they need only
sign the forms -themselves and have them approved
and stamped at the Registrar’s Office. ’

Gil Named Security Head _

intendent when Joseph R. Gil, who has been assis- .

Tuition Raised (Again) ,

For the fourth consecutive year, the University A :

raised its tuition for graduate and undergraduate
students. '

Full-time graduate and undergraduate students A

who qualify as Pennsylvania residents paid :

more this term in tuition under the new fee of $485.

" Tuition hikes were also assessed part—time, Law,
Medicine, and Dental Medicine students who are
residentsof Pennsylvania.

Out-of-state students, save those in the School of 4
Law, were spared any tuition increase. Vice Chan- ,
cellor of the Health Professions Edison Montgom-
ery, then Vice Chancellor of Finance, said that since

the primary reason for Pitt’s financial squeeze 
the failure of the state to produce sufficient fundsj’ 
it was thought to be unfair to tax non-Pennsylvania  .

residents for the added burden.

Need Determines Aid’

Some student leaders may soon have a
time paying their swollen tuitions.

The Office of Student Affairs in May announced 

that, effective this spring, all merit scholarships, 
will be awarded on the basis of demonstrated neegﬁfi

ijltdictttry Also Amended

, Conduct Code Revised

by EVAN PATTAK
‘Associate Editor
The- University has adopted a
new code of student conduct
regulations and a new student
judicial system this term.

The Interim Code of Stu-
dent Regulations. which applies
to all Pitt students, enumerates
student rights and freedoms and
conduct regulations. including
a list of 23 punishable offenses.

Among those offenses, which
may be punished by suspen-

.sion or expulsion from the Uni-

versity, are intentional false re-
porting of fires or bombs, pur-
porting to represent the Univer-
sity in support of a politician,
issue, or campaign, or using
University funds for" same, pos-
session of firearms, and “illegal
possession, use, or distribution
of marijuana, LSD, or other hal-
lucinogens and narcotic drugs.”
The Code also establishes the
University's prerogative of prose-
cuting a student. though civil

authorities may be prosecuting.

concurrently. or have already

prosecuted.

‘ The ‘Office of the Coordin-
ator for Campus Judicial Sys-
tems, created under the new
University Student Judicial
System, will monitor all hear-
ings of academic schools, or-
ganizations and housing and
will ensure that the judicial
procedures in these areas are
fair. This Campus Judicial
Office ‘also has original juris-
diction in complaints initiated

’ by Security or University ‘mem-

bers of the University community
atlarge.

dents and others.

Applicants for the position
of Coordinator, which will be
responsible to the Chief Ad-

ministrative “Officer for Student

Affairs, are currently being
interviewed.
Also established under the

new system is the University
Review Board, which has the
“authority to sit as an appeals
board in all cases involving
offenses in which the poten-
tial sanction for violation of
the rule is suspension or dis-
missal.” The Board must accept
the petition of any student
whose trial has resulted in sus-
pension or dismissal.

The Code and Judicials Sys-
tem were written by a student/
faculty/trustee Committee on
Student Rights and Responsi-
bilities appointed by the Chan-
cellor last January.

Executive Assistant Vice Chan-
cellor for Student Affairs Dan Mc-
Fadden said that the new systems
were necessary, because "last
year, the system generally broke
down."

“The existing code was a
compilation of bits and pieces,
a lot of which had not been
put down in an orderly format,”
he said.

He added that in addition ‘to
trying to make the code and
judicial process more “equit-
able," the committee had

"tried to bring out judicial sys-.

term in line with recent court
decisions.“

McFadden said that the Code
was called "interim" in order
to leave open channels for
amendments suggested by facul-
ty and students.

Joseph Gil, Superintendent
of Security Services and mem-
ber of the Rights and Respon-
sibilities Committee offered
praise for the new codes. “I’ve
got tremendous confidence in
it,” he said. I

Dr. Harold Hoelscher, Dean
of the School of Engineering,

called the Code ” fair,
comprehensive, and an im-
provement. "

Bill Markus, Director of Stu-
dent Activities announced an
immediate policy change regard-
ing ticket sales for student spon-
sored events. Tickets must now
be purchased in advance from
the ticket office in Schenley
Hall. No tickets will be sold at
the door.

"We have had constant prob-
lems with. cash exchange," ex-
plained Markus. "Large num-
bers of people were handling the
tickets. Students ‘lost’ tickets and
there was a potential for mon-
ies to be diverted. We feel that
this problem has gone on for
some time and this will take the
responsibility from the students

and eliminate the possibility of.

students being compromised.

“I have handled 20 or so
accusations or counter-accusa-
tions within the past year and
I feel there is a need for change
due to the looseness of the oper-
ation.

Markus also pointed out that
more accurate financial records
will be kept than in the past. In
addition, the ticket office will

Among the groups affected by
the policy change are the Stu-

regularly sponsor movies and?
other events.

Barbara “BJ" Johnson, SUBSC
chairman, said of the new pro-
cedure:

“It has its good and bad
points. It takes a lot of the
responsibility off the students,
but students will forget, and’
since they will

many students will be unable

member of the SUSBC felt that’
the policy change was “not in‘

and would inconvenience ratheri 4’

than condition the students.”

at the door. "Many students
will forget to purchase their-
tickets, or because they are from
another area school or college

it will be impossible for them 

to get their tickets in advance,”
he said.

SMarkus responded to this say-

ing, "Yes, initially it shall af-.--.

of conditioning the students so
they will plan ahead to pur-
chase their tickets before the
event is scheduled. it is a noble
experiment; if this doesn’t
work, maybe we’ll havegto try
something else."

Seemingly his philosophy
worked and Banners
managed to stay away from se-
rious injuries. The tracksters
had a very impressive showing
in‘ the more important meets

This year, Banner has not
yet cancelled any early meets,

another step instead.

The track team will see no
meet action until the end of
September, when they open

By VINCE DiNARDO'

On July 7th, the Pitt athletic department took
steps to quell charges of racism launched at
them by the Black Action Society last fall..Ath-
letic Director Casimir Myslinski, after much con-
sideration, hired Al Smith, a former athletic dir-
ector at North Carolina A&T to the post of assist-
ant athletic director. —

Smith‘s hiring placed the first black in an ad-
ministrative post in the Universitys history and

,/ left all concerned seemingly happy.

Smith had been very active in athletics
throughout his college career as well as an active
past in executive positions.

In 1963, Smith received a Master of Science»
degree in recreation administration from George

Williams College, then spent three years there
as its varsity baseball coach. Later, the 37 year
old Smith, also served asdirector of_the Student
Union at Knoxville College. ' a

Smith was one of the founders and treasurer
of the new Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference.
A&T was one of the seven members of the newly
formed league which began its existance this past
July.

While at A&T. Smith also served as director
of the student union and was active in the Greens-
bore area as a baseball coach there before becom-
ing athletic directorfor three years. '

With "these credentials "behind. him_, both the

have-Smith’_s.serv_ices available.-j  , . .
“-We‘ are happ’y3‘to have ,‘a"'_'_.r_nan -of-,'Al‘s calibre

‘and athletic; knowledgef’, Myslinski said.in an--"i

nouncing him. “I‘m confident he will make a sol-
id contribution to our athletic department."

The B.A.S., which had charged the athletic"

department, helped in picking Smith. In con-
junction with a number of alumni, and a group

. of students (both black and white) ten interviews‘ .,
4 were takenhfor the" post and a list of four re_:cor‘n_-A‘ A 

'mendations was turned over, to Myslinski, who
then" finalized the decision.

“I think what Mys1inski'has.in.mind for Smith
is to carry out his projects," said Dean Billick,
the schools sports information director. "He will
not be a figurehead but he will serve in adminis-
trating Mysli"nski's.‘de_Cisio,ns._ Basically,‘ he will-

be concerned with the’ f_und'arnental duties of their '

athletic department.

In addition ‘to tliat, ‘Bemis is
also asking for‘ people to offi-
ciate the football contests that
will begin in a couple months.

Richard Utley. of the B.A.S.', on the other hand
sees Smith as that and much more.

"I feel the athletic department needed Al
Smith." Utley said, “I'm sure he can do the job,
if they let him do the job. Now the black athle-
tes have someone to relate to in the administra-
tive end of the department. I think it‘s more than
a step in the right direction." '

“I think Al could change the old image in the
athletichdepartment here," continued Utley, "at
least he provides a different image."

After a month in his new post, Smith has
spent most of his time getting acclimated to the
university. His duties have become more specific

and he is confident that the university is‘,,since_re,

in its bid to change for the better.

“Ibelieve that ‘

Smith.

 Unity Key To ’71 Socc

by STEVE ZYCH

"If we finally put it together
this year and can stay clear of
major injuries we should have a
good year," soccer Coach Leo
Bemis cautiously said about the
upcoming season.

The elusive “it" that Bemis is
referring to, is the teamwork
which the squad has lacked in the

The booters will need plenty of
teamwork this year as their sche-

 dule is filled with ‘tough oppon-
_; ents, most of whom; lost little in
" the way of graduation.

Bemis, meanwhile, has lost the
likes of forward Tsima Lekoma
(leading scorer two years ago),
halfback Dave DiEmidio, goalie
Kerry Krause through graduation
and may lose two more‘regulars.
Forward Gus Theofilos and full-’
back J_erry Kruth will be in lim-
bo until next Wednesday when
their fate will be decided jointly
by the athletic directors from
Pitt, West Virginia, Syracuse and
Penn State. Kruth is appealing

‘ another year of eligibility as he

played only two years after trans-
ferring from Slippery Rock in his
sophomore year, while Theofilos
is an academic trouble. '

Both are top players and Bem-
is has repeatedly said of Theofi-
l_os, “He has all the tools to be’
an All-American.” The forward
gave an example of his skill this
past summer at Three Rivers
when he scored two goals and
assisted on another against a first
division German team. Later he
scored all six goals in a 6-1 rout
of the U.S. amateur champions
Hellas.

Should the team suffer the loss
of Theofilos, Bemis may have to
abandon his plan to switch Tony
Nicholakopoulos back to defense.
Bemis was hoping to send the
long and lanky senior to the back-
field in an effort to bolster the
offensive capability of his de-
fense. '

“I want two way ‘players back

there-guys who will come up _
once in a while to take a shot at

the opposing goal," says Bem-
is. ,Nicholakopoulos can certain-
ly “take a shot" as he scored
three goals last year as a half-
back forward. '

If Theofilos is lost to the team
and Nicholakopoulos is forced ‘to
return to the frontline the three
or four fullback positions will
probably be filled by seniors Tom
Jones and Mike Pincus, junior
Gary Midock and sophomore Fer-
nando Carriquiry.

Fernandos cousin Jorge Maur-
er will be one of half a’ dozen

players going out for the two or ,

three halfback positions. Other

contenders include juniors Len‘

Raffa, Larry Skalski and Denny
Kozak, and sophomores Denny
Kohlmeyer and Bill Hauck.

The fight- among the forwards
for starting berths will be mostly
between Ali Rdissi, ChuCho Val-
encia, Tony Bolea, Jorge Gut-
ierrez, Gus Theofilos, Tony Nich-
olakopoulos, Joe Luxbacher, and
Kevin Crowley. Bolea and Gut-
ierrez played for the J.V. team
last year, scoring eight and 12
goals‘ respectively, in seven gam-
es.

By far thejmost sought after
position is at the lone goaltend-

Friday, September 3, 1'£l7il--T-HE PITT NEWS-—lPagie' ‘L I 

er ’ Success

ers spot, vacated due to the grad-
uation of Krau_se. Six different
players are contending for the

slot with the favorites being jun-A

iors Steve Fibel and the very ver-
satile and volatile John White.

For White, who missed most
of last year because of an in-
jury, this will be his fifth or
sixth different position in less
than three years. He led the team
in scoring his freshman year, then
was switched to defense.

Thus the team has, in the
words of fullback Gary Midock,

"good replacements for those who V I

graduated and adequate depth."

ChuCho Valencia summed up
the general feeling the players
when he said, “We have a good
chance of going far'——— if we play
our best and as a team.” .

Bemis echoed ChuCho by sum-
ming it up thusly, “If we per-
form as a-team- and not as a
group of individuals, and barring
major injuries, we should be able
to play over five hundred."

Considering the wealth of -tal- 
ent on this team (“the best I‘ve‘

seen in my four years here at

Pitt” according to ChuCho) that,
overly -cautious observation by '
,Bemis is a gross understatement.

The credentials of the trio are
impressive. '

Daniels, a six foot, _l80'pound G

the All-Steel Valley team and_ is

an excellent passer and play call— ’

Hapless Phils

It took the Pirates and Philly
pitchers four innings to calm the
hitting on Wednesday night at
Three Rivers Stadium but the
Bucs emerged Victorious in a 10-7
slugfest. The win meant a sweep

of the three game series by Pitts-

burgh.

The loss dropped the Phils into
last place of the National League
East division, while the Pirates
stretched their first place lead to
sixygames over the Cardinals. Be-
hind a four-hit pitching perform-
ance by Tom Seaver. the New
York Mets whipped St. Louis. 7-1.
on Wednesday night.

The lead shifted five times in
the first three innings as the two
teams racked up 15_ runs on 16
hits. Both starters. the Pirates‘
Dock Ellis and the Phils‘ Woody
Fryman, got knocked out early.

After the Phils tallied two in the
opening frame,‘the Pirates dis-
played their awesome hitting at-
tack as they produced five runs.
The entire order reached the
plate with the big hits being dou-
bles by Willie Stargell and Al
Oliver.

Not to be outhlt. the Phils came
right back with four runs in the

second. Two walks and two home-. '

runs by Ron Stone and Deron
Jones put them back into the lead.

Gene Climes started thePi,-

rates going again in the second. 
After reaching first with a single,-. ‘

he stole second and moved to third
on an errant throw. Roberto Cle-
mente walked and Stargell picked

up his second RBI of the evening’ .1

with a sacrifice fly. Manny San-
guillen capped the scoring with a
two run homer. .. A
Luke Walker, the t'ourth'pitch-
er for the Bucs, registered the
win as he allowed only one run and
two hits in the six innings that he

pitched. It upped his season rec-. 

0rd to 7-8.

Stargell-‘s two RBIs moved him
into the NL lead with the’Cardi-

nals Joe Torre a tight second with '
_ 113.

Clementes single in the first

inning placed him into ninth posi-
tion on the all-time list for total
bases in the National League. His

lifetime total now stands at 4.286 » «
~bases. -

Tonight, the Pirates open a
three game series against the
Montreal Expos, and follow with a
Labor Day doubleheader with the
Chicago Cubs.

In case anyone is counting. the

 Here’s bow to score your answers.'( But
please, don’t read any furtlaer. until

tbe best of your ability.) ''’v'\

lutely right. The ﬁnest diamonds have no
_ color of their own whatever. They merely blaze

 

 

  

 

 4; i5;l’1‘T'l\Il.iWS-Friday,iiSeptember3, 1971 ‘

“Do you make these ﬁve common mistakes

about selecting diamonds?

TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE. IF YOU ANSWER ALL FIVE QUESTIONS RIGHT, YOU'RE AN EXPERT.

1. The ﬁnest diamonds are
A. White B. Slightly yellow C. Blue-white
D. Colorless

2. When a diamond’s clarity is not marred by any scratch,
spot, cloud or other.blemish, the gem can properly be
described as
A. “Ideal” C. "Flawless”

_ 3. When professionals refer to a diamond's "cut“ they mean

B. “Perfect”

A A. Its general shape, such as round, oval, pear, marquise
‘ or emerald. ‘

B. The extent to which the angles and proportions of its
many sides, or facets, conform to the ideal for its par-
ticular shape.

C. The diamond's ability to scratch other

hard surfaces,
such as glass or steel. A

-1. The value of a diamond is determined by its
A. Carat weight ' B. Cut C. Color
E. Price

. D. Clarity

5. Aside from differences in the price ranges of various prod-
ucts, selecting a diamond is most like choosing
A. a watch B. Savings bonds C. a steak D. a new car

you’oe answered all tbe questions to

 
  
  
   
  

with all the colors of the light that enters them. I

If you checked “Blue-white,” be careful? The term
is fraught with many meanings and loopholes. It is
used as a sales aid by some jewelers to help sell diamonds
of inferior color. Because "blue-white” is inexact and mis-
leading, we forbid the use of this term‘ in referring to any
diamond at Hardy & Hayes. A

2. If you checked "ﬂawless,” you’re right again. A ﬂawless dia-
mond is not necessarily a "perfect” one, however. The Federal
Trade Commission’s ruling on the use of this term states that
besides being ﬂawless a diamond must not be of inferior color or
make. There really is no such thing as a "perfect” diamond.

Like the term "blue-white,” the term "perfect” is forbidden
at Hardy & Hayes. - ‘

3. You are right if you chose answer  Diamonds are cut in

~ different styles, such as round, oval, etc. There are Ideal angles ‘

and proportions for each style. ' '

When-a professional refers to cut, he is talking about the
human factor of a diamond’s beauty. Just how well has man done
his job? If the cutter‘ deviates from the precise angles and propor-
tions of the Ideal, your diamond would have less beauty and
should therefore cost you less than a more precise cut.

4. If you chose any one of the four Cs, you’re partly right. A
diamond’s value is determined by all four.

The price you pay for a diamond includes more than the value
of the gem itself; the value of the ringior other setting, for in-
stance. A portion of the seller's cost of doing business also is in-
cluded, as is his proﬁt.

Because all Hardy & Hayes diamonds are obtained directly,
Via New York cutters, from the London sights of the Central
Selling Organization (marketing arm for all jewelry diamonds
in the world) our price does not include the profits and expenses
of intermediate brokers, wholesalers or agents. For this reason,
you often pay less at Hardy & Hayes than you would elsewhere
for a diamond of comparable quality.

Judge for yourself. We'll give you a booklet* that explains

‘how the various characteristics of a~diamond are rated and

how the professionals compare one diamond with another. It's a

/

   
   

derstand. We’ll answer any questions ; you
may have and, if you have time, show you
examples of the characteristics you’ll want to
watch for. '

,',/ Then shop around.

5. Buying a diamond has something in common with all
four possible answers, of course. ‘Watches and automobiles,
being manmade, can be standardized, however. You can usually
expect one new car to perform as well and ride as comfortably as
another of the same make, model and equipment. But nature
never does anything quite the same way twice.

Savings bonds have but one variable—their size, or dollar
value. You look at the denomination and you know what each
one’s worth. Not so a diamond.

Selecting one is thus most like choosing a steak. No two’ are
quite alike. * Price per _pound (or carat) is only one of several
considerations. Color and clarity are as important in a diamond

as tenderness and ﬂavor-in a steak. And cut, certainly,-is vital to

both.

Of course, one way to be sure of getting a good steak is to go to '

a good, butcher. We'll spare you the rest of this analogy.

I f you got four of tlae ﬁve questions rlgbt, your krzoz..>'l:'rr'-ge of

diamonds is above average. But even if you missed only one, it’

would be wise to find «,:,-.2; all you can about a'z'a/Izontls before

you actually invest in one: W/e’ll be deliglyterl to laelp you learn. ‘
as much as you care to. Don’t feel you'd be im[7osing. After all, .

tlye more you know about dt'amona's, tlae better for us.
