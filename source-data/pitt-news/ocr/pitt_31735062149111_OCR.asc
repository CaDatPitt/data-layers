Cup This Year

“It gives revolution!” \'\'itli
this cry on their lips, the sopho-
mores cheered their way to vic-
tory at the inter-class siiig; Mon-
day. In fact, for the second con-
secutive year, the pep and ori;:i-

Carry Sign

At Heinz House, the sophomores
carried on a private little revolution
of their own. Carrying signs hear-
ing the famous slogan of “Liberte,"
Egalite, Frateznite." they demanded,
that their oppressors, the freshman,
junior, and senior classes, be brought
to trial.

On the grounds that while the sen-
iors had the p:esidency oi’ WSGA,
that the juniors had charge of the
units: and that the freshmen were
pampered and spoiled by special at-
tention and events, the sophomores
received no honors whatsoeve:', the‘
opposing classes were convicted. The
"nrasked marvel,” or master of the
guillotine. cut oil’ the heads of the
efﬁgies of the freshman, junior and
senior classes. Hilda Landerman.
was chairman of the committee
which prepared the winning skit. i

History Enacted

The freshman skit depicted the.
history of the University. The found- 1
ing of Pitt, receipt of the charter,
burning of the old building, the mov-
ing of the Western University ‘of;
Pennsylvania to Allegheny, entrance:
of the Stein sisters. Alumni Hall, and
the building of the Cathedral amply
covered the story of how the Univer-
sity started and progressed.

Honor to the Nationalities Rooms
was paid in the junior skit. _ Starting
out with tea in the Commons Room,
the juniors’ in song, visited the Scot-
tish, German, Russian, and early
American rooms. A highland ﬂing,
and a spirit of "76 march were the
lligll lights or their presentation. ..

ed the seniors so much that they

Dr. Hudnut Predicts Nazi Collapse .

If Anti-Semitic Drive Continues

By Ruggcro Aldisert
Bittcrly denouncing the German]
government's anti-semitic policy and
attacking its entire authoritarian‘
structure, Dr. Herbert E. Hudnut,,
pastor of the Bellevue Presbyterian;
church, predicted the imminent col-I
lapse of Nazi rule, speaking before!
last Mondays Inquiry Forum audi-I
encc. 
Basing his conclusions on personal!
observations made on recent travels,
through Germany and by “unbiased”
opinions of foreign correspondents,‘
Dr. Hudnut labeled the Nazis as “sav-
ages” and pointed out ﬁve falsities
upon which their idealogy is based.
Visited Germany
He maintained that Hitler will tot- -
ter because of “Germany’s exceed-
ingly ditficult economic structure,”
the urge of the intellectuals for de-
mocracy, the repression of religion,§
the anti-semitic program, and “their
super racialism.”
“Nazis are savages.” he explained,i
“because so many refugees are pour-
ing out of the country telling most:

terrible stories of sadistic persecu- E
tions.” . .

When Dr. Hudnut last visited Ger- 3
many in 1936 heestimated that 80;
per cent of the Germans were on the i
fence; that they would go along with ;
Hitler as long as he guessed right.

“In the last ﬁve international crises,  Eddy company and referred at" many 
5 instances to the New York Times for l one, and all members of these two

tory decisions,” Dr.‘:Hudnut added. i

"date..

Every sooften, in reading our daily newspaper, we‘;
get an uncontrollable urge to make comment on every
little item we see, to read into the news stories all sorts
oi’ interpretations and hidden meanings, which may or}
may not be the case. Today was one of those days; as
a result, this journal entry might be entitled “Portraitﬂ
of a Man Reading his Daily Newspaper” or something. 3’

We notice by the headlines, first 01' all, that “Iron?
Man” Daladier has everything well in hand again (for
the time being) after a bitter but unsuccessful ﬁght by
the remnants of the old “Popular Front” in the French
Chamber of Deputies. This, no doubt, will strengthen
the Premier’s hand in his dealings with Italy, which
was quick to take advantage of internal dissension in
France. But we have doubted all along that any crisis
would be perpetrated over Tunis or Corsica or any
other of the more ostensible objectives of

Mussolini’s Demands . . .
The ex-journalist, ex-paciﬁst, ex-socialist dictator off
a hazy new Roman empire is too smart to think he can
obtain these French possessions at present. He seems,
rather, to be using them as bargaining points, throwing
in such comparatively minor items as control of the
French railroad in Ethiopia and rights to the Suez canal 
as casual demands. VVe’re willing to bet Il Duce will;
compromise on these “casual demands,” which, after;
all, are probably what he really wants. 
While still on the foreign affairs pages, we almost;
missed a little piece of. ﬁller with a Memel datelinel
which real like this: 
Viktor Gailius, a Lithuanian resident of Meme], _
today was named governor of that 1‘~ormer German 
territory. Gailius, a moderate, who won the Iron 
Cross ﬁghting for Germany in the World war, suc-~
ceeds J ouzas Kubilius, whose vetoes of Nazi-supported
bills in the Lithuanian parliament incurred Nazi dis-
favor. ' ,
Our first impulse was to berate the make-up editor
for a poor piece of editing. But after re-reading the
piece, we decided that that simple little Associated Press
dispatch told all it was necessary to know, and chroni- 5
cled more completely than columns of explanation ma-' f

A terial another long—pr,emeditate-d phaseeof the “Drang

We passed up the all-important news from Peru and

the Pan-American cont’erenr:e in favor of some develop-

ments in our own back-yard. A

Poor Mayor Scully . . . .

We discovered, was being blasted all over the place
for his announced intention of instituting a tliree-mill
tax increase. Chief blasters, of course, were the real
estate men, and so—called “Taxpayers’ leagues. ,

It looks from this corner like the old game oi trying '
to get something for nothing, of iorgetting that with the
increase of governmental functions, an occasional tax
revision might be necessary. VVhich reminds us of the =‘
incident one of our professors likes to tell of the Con-
gressman who boasted to his constituents how he had
voted for evéry'7appropriiit.ion bill and opposed -zveryi
revenue bill during the session.

I't‘ditor, The Pitt N-ews.
Dear Sir:

I would like to use this means to
explain the position and policy of
the Junior Prom committee in con"-

fducting this year’s annual 1"'ormal
<l3.DCe- . .. V . .
First: Satisfying the wishes of

the student body ingetting a big
name band on campus, we broke a
University precedent and got Larry
Clinton and his famous orchestra at
a high cost. It can easily be seen
that “big name bands” at future

*University dances will depend upon

the success or failure of this year’s
Junior Prom.

Second: We feel. that we owe it
to the students who buy their tick-
ets ﬁrst to limit the number of tick-
ets sold. We feel obliged to provide
them sufficient dancing room and to
asstire them a good dance.

Third: I have l*.ea:'cl complaints
from members of other classes that
it is unfair for Juniors to be able to
buy tickets before them. Since the
Junior class is assuming the respon-
sibility of ﬁnancing a dance which
will perhaps be the best of the year,
we think that members of our class
should have the first chance to se-
cure tickets. However, beginning
today. tickets will go on sale to all
students at the University.

I hope that I have been able to;

make the policy of the Junior Prom
Committee clearer to the student
ibody. We extend a cordial invita-
étion to all students. BUT the tickets
will be limited.

In order to assure themselves of
the opportunity of enjoying the best
school affair in some time, I suggest

tickets before the Christmas recess.
Sincerely, A
EMIL E. NARIC, BA-10.

BY LEONARD LEVISON
Sports Editor

Somewhere. sometime, someplace. someone told us that the Ivy League
was just about the epitome in intercollegiate athletic conferences. We were
led to believe that all was sweetness and light among the Ivy Leaguers.
Furthermore. it was impressed upon us that our social salvation, or at least,
our athletic prestige was entirely dependent upon our admission into this
sanctified circle.

One or the reasons that we always thought occasioned their un1'riendli-
ness in the matter of booking football games with us was that Pitt was just,
plainly and simply, too good a team. We believed that this was the reason
that brought these New England cloisterers to whispering the ugly word
about Pitt.

Dartmouth Man Takes The Stand

So it was not with somewhat of a jolt that we found one of these self-
same.untoucha‘o.le Ivy Leaguers coming out and agreeing with us. As a mat-
ter of fact, this Ivy League team had the same problem that Pitt has . '
it was winning too much. But, instead of agreeing with its unjust character
defamers, these Ivy Leaguers stood right up and swung back straight from
the shoulder. They didn’t point the ﬁnger at themselves. They knew that
they didn’t liave anything of which to be ashaiiiecl.

Before we go any further let us give you the exact words of Mr. Vlfhitey
Fuller, sports eozninentator of the Dartmouth Daily.

“There  one thing that we want to say. not as an oilicizil of even the
lowest roung, ‘out merely as a Dartmouth man.

“And that is that Dartmouth was pretty cruelly treated by some of its
so-called college friends during the period that our football teams were go-
ing through 22 consecutive games without defeat. Now that the Big Green
has been licked twice we have undoubtedly reg-.iined a prestige for athletic
integrity we never deserved to lose and never would have lost but for the
vicious, ungentlemanly, small, and malicious gossip carried on by some who
gained much for tlieniselxfes in order that Dartmouth might gain little for
her hard earned and well-deserved success on the gridiron.

Nothing To Defend

“One Ivy League coach even went so far as to say that the Dartmouth
eleven was well named “Big Green” but that he could think of a better nick-
name-—“The Junior Green Bay Packers.” A brother alumnus of ours in the
sports writing prol'e:<sion was called upon to defend our College team at a
banquet at which he attended. On discovery of what was meant by “defend”
he promptly told the gathering to go to hell and by the shortest route, and
who can say that he did not act wisely?

“We do not wish to rake over dead ashes. But the Cornell and Stanford
games proved decisively that Dartmouth under Coach Earl Blaik accom-
plished much with material that many another coach and coaching staff
would never have started from the mark, let alone race with flying colors
over much of a three year course. A

Bury Ivy League—It’s Dead

“We do not speak with bitterness about those who questioned Dart-
mouths’ basic reasons for its victories. We speak only with contempt-and
lasting hatred for those who carried on the campaign. Were we not shackled
by official duties we would not hesitate to name those people, those colleges,
those alumni of other institutions who were the main ‘whispers and eye-
lifters. But someday when in a position to do so, we hope to have the privi-
lege of repaying their friendship to our college, and believe me, it will have
to be plenty terrible to approach the cheap forms taken by some. We know
full well that if and when the oppor,tunity~-does arise, we will be the first to
:do nothing about it. On the othelrlhand, if it is not'pdssib1e to win football
games in the Ivy League and keep any “friends,” what a fine example this
group of supposedly superior colleges of ﬁne vintage set for the less for-
tunate——in heritage only—.-colleges and universities of America. All we can
say is bury most of the group, for they walk the streets as corpses without
knowing that they are dead from the heels up!

“Which is all there is to be said on the subject. Next fall with Dartmouth
football at a low ebb it will be, “What a swell gang of people the Dartmouth
men are. And Dartmouth should certainly be proud of the way her boys
play so gloriously in defeat.” Personally we were mighty proud of the boys
who went out and played for keeps, but never snarling and biting at the
two teams that were good enough, and big enough to win deserved victories
over the home forces.”

You may say it again. ‘Whitey. for us.

Bradley Tech. one of the country’s
greatest quintets, next entertained
Pitt at Peoria and had little trouble
muzzling the Panthers, 56-39. The‘
press dispatclies refered to the ’
Bradley Tech victory as "the great-.

It was the second decisive win of;
the season for the Tech ﬂoormen.

Pueksters Meet i

Wﬂdcat lee. Six

With Western Reserve as hosts,
the ,Pant.her_,,hockey‘ team journeys
to Cleveland tomorrow night for its
.ﬁrst appearance there this season.

Reserve, rated about fourth in the
league standing, is an up and down
team that can be a pushover one
night and a fighting, dominating
scourge the next. ,

Last yea‘: the Clevelanders lost!
their ﬁrst game with Pitt, 1-0, but
came back in the second conflict to
hold the over confident Blue and
Gold to a 3-3 tie.

Goal tender Berkeley, last season
selected as All League Goalie, is the
outstanding Wildcat. Handling his
position with a professional air, he
is smooth and confident in all his
movements, a constant thorn to op-
posing lines.

In the Pitt-Reserve ﬁrst meeting
it took over two periods for the Pitts
to ﬂash the red light over the Cleve-
land star. This came when Lowe
took -a pass from Conick, feinted
Berkeley out of position and pushed
the puck into the open corner.

In the second meeting the Pitts,
suﬁering from over conﬁdence and
an off it night 'oJ1.,the._pa1't of Goalie
Ellis, had to'come from behind in
the third period to tie. In the over-
time period neither team could break
the deadlock and the game end-
ed 3-3.

Coach McSorley, still juggling his
squad, has not decided deﬁnitely on
