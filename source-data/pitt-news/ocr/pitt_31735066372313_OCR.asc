  ittMoneyTied Upin Bonds

BY FREDERICK BEERS

 Because of the structure of the
state bonding authority that.Pitt
once borrowed from in order_to
finance campus construction. the
university may lose several thousand
dollars it has in a reserve fund.
The Pennsylvania Higher Educa-
tion Facilities Authority. which

financed part of the construction of '

Ruskin Hall. could tap the debt ser-
vice reserve that ‘Pitt is required to
hold until the bonds are paid off.
The Authority is structured in
such a way that if PHEFA cannot
repay the bonds fora particular pro-
ject. it may. tap the debt service
reserve from other projects it has
financed, according to .loe Dutton,
iPitt‘s vice chancellor for business
and finance. The debt service reserve

is equal to one year’s debt service.‘

and is part of the original borrow-
ing. Dutton said.

He said he /was “critical“ of this
aspect of PHEFA’s structure. He
added that another option of the
Authority is to take over a building

and sell it if the payments are not V

made.
Because of PHEF/\’s ‘~‘common—
ality of pledge and security." Dutton
.prefers_ the bonding authority that
7 Pitt is currently involved with. the
Allegheny County Higher Educa-
tion Assistance Authority. With»the
HEAA. each issue stands by itself
and therefore less risk is involved if
the project is viable. accordingito
Dutton. .
Recently, the Authority’s finan-
cial advisor. Parker-Hunter of Pitts-
burgh. recommended that PH EFA
refinance $l()() million in bonds. lt
also tendered its resignation as
financial advisor and requested to
become the lead ‘underwriter in the
proposed refinancings.
Peter Traub. a ‘vice president of

‘Parker-Hunter. said recently that i

“in view of what I think is a dispar-
aging press article (by the ‘Asso-
ciated Press). it is in the better

interests of our firm. and the inter-
ests of Pennsylvania" for Parker-
Hunter to resign as financial
advisor. \

Representative James Gallagher.

Frat Housing Meets Opposition -

By SETH LUBOVE

The site of‘Pitt‘s proposed frater-
nity housing complex has yet to be
overtaken by the noise and clamor
of construction machinery. ‘ but
nearby residents are already raising
their own cloud of dust in opposi-
tion to the complex.

Their concerns center on the park-
ing problems and excess noise which

they claim may result from parties-

and fraternity events.

“Mainly. people up here are con-
cerned about courtesy to the neigh-
bors and parking on our streets.”
said Ron Coleman of the Bracken-
ridge Street (‘iti/ens’ Group.

The site of the proposed complex
is off Uni\‘ersit_v Drive next to the
Falk School playground and across
lroim the Veterans Administration
Hospital. Nearby streets include
Brackenridge and Avalon. and part
of Centre Avenue.

Coleman said that parking prob-
lems already caused by people going

day football games would just be
com poundetf by the presence of rfa-
ternities. He also accused the univer-
sity of pushing into his
neighborhood the problems cur-
rently faced by residents who now
live near the fraternities. 7 ~
“That’s all they’re doing. pushing
.their problems up on the hill. The
money they're'going to be spending
for these fraternities could be spent

on those.houses.". he said. .

“Our streets are quiet and clean
and everybody who owns a house
keeps their propertyelean. And we‘d
like to have a nice. quiet peaceful
neighborhood instead of getting the
problems from the’ other neighbor-
hood/." Coleman added.

The university estimates a com-
pletion date of January. l983~. for the _.
complex. Although the complex was
planned with eight fraternities in

Andy Smith. director of student
activities. believes that parking
would not cause a major pitoblem
forithe neighborhood residents.
“If you buy the argument that

‘ parking is the only problem. that

would not be accurate." he said.

Smith said that since the project is
still in theifinal planning stage, Pitt
hasn‘t made any decisions on pro-
viding parking for the fraternities.
He added that he felt the complex
site is a “reasonable distance" from
the neighborhood.

“l think thecommunity has legiti-
mate concerns and we hope to have
some further movement after

November." he said. ' '

Survey Shows Students Want

By SCOT STONE

A majority of college students
in Pennsylvania, including 78
percent of Pitt students, favor
world-wide nuclear disarma-
ment, according to a recent sur-
vey condueted by the Worldwide
if Disarmament
(WNDN). .

The survey results are part ofa
nation-wide effort to sample
public opinion on the issuer of
nuclear disarmament.’ The
WNDN is hoping to demon-

strate that a strong base of popul’

lar opposition to nuclear
weapons exists. and that it is pos-
sible for political leaders to safely

SUPP0rYdisarmament legislation.

' The

Network

Pennsylvania poll, which
incl_uded’over I00 Pitt responses,
asked five questions designed to
reflect the level of popularisupport
for disarmament. By “world—wide
disarmament," the WNDN means
“doing away with all the atom. hy-
drogen and nuetron bombs the
USA, USSR and all other countries

I'l;t\C so there are no nuclear wea~

pons left in the world."

The WN'DT\5 is a world-wide
g_'7‘;lﬁs‘S-l‘t‘)'!‘liS organization that
'rt(.l‘\'()C2iIL‘s ._")lT1plCLC nuclear dis-
armament. and opposes the
growing attitude among defense
officials that nuclear war, on a
limited scale, is both possible and
winnable.

In addition. the survey shows
th:t 83 percent of college stu-
deits believe that there is a glo-
bal majority in favor of nuclear
disarmament. but that there is
also a strong possibility of
nuclear war within their life-
times. 70 percent of the college
respondents said they believed a
nuclear_war would occur in their
lifetimes. i '

The survey further showed that a
strong majority of college students
and members of the general public

would vote for candidates
advocated dis;_!rmament.

’ The surveys are conducted by
WNDN members on various
campuses

and communities.

Pittstudents are Pinball Wizards

By DENNIS §CHﬁUERMANN

,Ever since video games became
popular. they have been considered
as only “quarter eaters”or “mindless
diversions" by many of the students
who consider themselves above such
a7 form of recreation. But to John
Diulus and Dan Raj. two Pitt fresh-
men, video games could be their
passports to a possible $|2,00() in
cash and prizesiin the upcoming
international Atari “Tournament
Games Spectacular."

The tournament will be held the

P “weekend of Oct. 30-Nov. l in Chi-

cago. and Diulus and Rai will be
there to take on the_world’s best
video players in an attempt to bring
home a portion of the $4()().0()0 in
cash and pri7es which will be
awarded.

Diulus and Rai earned the right to
go to Chicago by placing first and
second respectively in a regional
qualifier which was sponsored by
Game Mania in Oakland. The quali-
fier took place on three consecutive
Sundays from Sept. l3-27.

1 Each participant was given three
minutes to obtain a high score on the
Atari Asteroids Deluxe machine.
After two weeks. Rai‘s score of
2ti.l30 was tops. but Diulus posted
26.440 in a dramatic third week fin-
ish to gain the victory by a slim 3 I()—
point margin.

Both students are being spon-
sored by (iame Mania. The game
they will be competing on in Chi~
cago will be Atari‘s Centipede. a rel-
atively new machine which neither
student is familiar with. Both stu-

dents have been getting free playing

time to practice on the machine
every morning at Game Mania.
Diulus is confident of his chan-

ces in Chicago and stated. “With a
little luck. maybe I can take the
top spot.“ Rai also has high hopes
and feels helcan finish “at least
above average." They will be
among hundreds of competitors
seeking the prize money which
ranges from $l2.()00 for first place
to $25 for with place.

Richard Cohen. part-owner of
Game Mania Inc. said. “lt‘ll be
tough. they‘ll be playing against the
top players from around the world.
hut,it would be nice to see them
bring home some money.”

John Diulus and Dan Rai could
not agree more, as Rai admitted.
"Even ill I don‘t win big. $25 is a lot

The Student Government Board

Some ofthe methods the SR(,‘ will

as the newsletter will alert the public
to silltlclll government activities.

The newsletter. Sim/mi (f()\‘c’I'n-

said. Abraham said he expects lb or
l7 petitions for board seats to be

Abraham cites this year’s board as ‘

«being one of the factors behind the
increased student interest in this
year‘s campaign.

“I think a few things we’ve started

to do has increased the visibility of

the SG B.“ he said. He gave the
examples of the board holding open
meetings and planning sessions and

SGB’s involvement with curriculum,

reform.

He also said that the interest is
“starting to dispel the apathy that
existed among students in the latter
part of the ‘70s.‘‘

Abraham said the next objective
is to" get a large voter turn out.
Approximately 2,400 students voted
in last year’s election. This year.
Abraham said he is hoping for a

voter turnout of 3.000 or more stu-‘

dents. He said thatamount would be
helpful to the SGB.

“‘With all those voters behind them.
they will have a mandate of (the)

Smith has taken over the project
for Lou McLinden. assistant direc-
tor of student activities. who is ‘cur-

E rently on-a medical leave ofabsence.

Sandy Phillips. president of Oak-
land Directions lnc.. a coalition of
community groups. said meetings
are being ‘held between residents of
the Bayard—Beilefield Street area
where the fraternity houses would be
sold. and those residents close to the
area where the fraternity complex
would be built;

“So far. the people in the area
where the fraternities might be leav-
ing are glad, although they feel that
we haven't yet worked out a satisfac-
tory process that guarantees them
that something good will come in.
And the people in the Alliquippa-
‘Brackenridge area are still worried
that maybe these fraternities will he

harmful to their neighborhood."
Phillips said.

“And I don’t think Pitt has really
fully answered their questions." she
added. ;'

The last meeting between Pitt and
the residents near the fraternity
housing site was held Oct. l. ,
A Phillips said that.'because the site
would be at least two blocks away
from the nearest residents. there is a
good chance it might not cause any
problems. “if Pitt would just take a
number ‘of precautions on parking
and noise and things like that."

“I believe Pitt could assure the res-
idents that theiproposal wouldn‘t
harm the neighborhood.”

“But so far Pitt has not really
taken the steps they need to take to
assure those people" that the fra-
ternities would not cause many
problems for the neighborhood_ she
said.

What is the Student Health Ser-
vice fee and what does the Student
Health Service offer." The Student
He_alth Advisory Board. a group of
Pitt Students who work with the
Student Health Service. prepared
this information.

For much of the University‘s his-
tory. health service programs have
been provided through the Student
Health Service (SHS). These pro-
grams have changed as the health
needs of the student body have
changed.

Prior to instituting a specific
health fee. the SHS accepted- cash.
student charge accounts .or third
party insurance reimbursement (for
example. Blue Cross) as payment
methods for services. As a result. the
quantity of staff necessary to make
the SHS function properly and to

adequately monitor account pay-,

ments constantly increased. This
system grew to be cumbersome and
limited the SHS‘s range of
programs.

Some time in the late l970‘s a man-
datory SI6 health fee was imple-
mented. This prepaid—fce system. or
capitation. allowed the SHS to
become self-supporting. That is.
instead of depending on the Univer-
sity's yearly allocation estimates. the
SHS could plan for quality services
based on the actual volume ofenrol-
lees.

The capitation system helps to
control costs since it requires the
SHS managers to project the costs
for the services. determine an
appropriate health fee. and as the
years go by. stay within those
projections. ‘ I

-The current SHS fee of $2l I

reflects the first inﬂationary increase
in more than a five year period. The

. fee is mandatory for all full-time

"non-College of General Studies
undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents. Part-time students-may elect

to join the service by paying the fee ,

along with their tuition invoice. If
the fee is not paid. service is avail-
able for an appropriate charge paid
at the time of the visit. Additional

l

medical insurance. such as pijvate
hospitalization insurance. is highly
recommended for all students.

The SHS offers many services
including: general medicine. derma-
tology. gynecology. internal
medicine. office surgery. allergy
injections and ilmmunivations.

There are walk-in visits and appoint-

ments. A walk—in patient is triaged.

that is. examined and assessed by

PERSPECTIVE: The SHS is a.
University service paid’ for by the '

students. as are all other services;
The SHS can be used effectively.
The modest fee provides enrollees
with unlimited use of the services
and programs. No other commercial

insurance plan covers physician, /

office visits for so nominal a charge.
Whether the SHS is used for prim-
ary treatment or second opinions, it
can‘ enhance the health of any
responsible student. ‘

~ Europeans over the issue of nuclear war.

‘put Ronald Reagan‘?

Ronald Reagan’s recent statements to news-
paper editors in Wastington last Friday, and the
contents of a speech made by the National Secur-
ity Council’s top military member, Major Gen-«

" eral Robert Schweitzer, havejcontributed to a

growingtmood of suspicion and anger among

According to newly-released transcripts ,.of

iReagan’s remarks to newspapermen at the White

House, the president said that “you could have
the exchangeof tactical‘ weapons against troops _
in thefield without it bringing either one of the

 major powers to pushing the button...”

Schweitzer, in a speech to the Association of
the United States Army, said that the Soviet
Union possessed nuclear superiority and is now
preparing to strike. . ' '

This‘ conbination of alarmism a‘nd apparent

lack of consideration forgir European allies is is

addingifuel to the already/powerful pacifist move;
ment, and has drawn eritical responses from sev-
eral high—ranking European leaders.

It is not illogical to expect such a reaction from
the continent after all, they5are the “field""’ on
which this lethal game of super-power chess is
being played. I ,.

The Europeans are‘ suspicious because they
fear the U.S. has secretly adopted a stratedgy of
contained nuclear confrontation along the
borders between the NATO allies, and~Warsaw
Pact countries. - 4' _

j]‘hey are angry because they believe that the
Americans are embarking on an insane policy of

confrontation with the Soviets that can only lead 5

to the destruction of Europe. .. r .
~Americans appearto be in a daze-on this issue.
It seems we have been conditioned to accept the

- Reagan‘ administrations reduction. of world

problems into the all-encompassing classification
of “the Red menace.” How else could a civilized
nation acceptia defensepolicy that takes seriously
the concept of a winable nuclear war?

Despite the fact that out defense budget

siphons offan enormous ammount ofpotentially ,

productive capital for the production of arms, it ’
becomes ludicrious to consider ourselves safer

, because we have more fire powerthan the Rus- ‘

sians. - ..
Former Secretary of Defense, Robert Mac-
Namara, said yesterday that it would be a much
more profitable investment in Americas national
security if we were to spend our defense billion
not on the production of more nuclear weapons,
but rather on the development of the economi-
cally feeable nations of the world. - S
b If MacNamara, the architect ofAmerica’s mas-
sive bombing stategy during the Vietnam War,
Jid reach such a conciasion, where does that
It does not seem that the president fits any-
where onthepolitical spectrum, but, on the issue
~ of defense and nuclear deterance, he is creating a
unique niche somewhere beyond reason.

Dear Editorzj

l was distressed to see that my

letter of resignation from the Legal
Awareness Committee was mis-
quoted in the Friday, Oct. 9 Student
Government Board story.

1 was quoted as stating my reason
for resignation as being “problems
within the Committee”. This V was
not, in fact, what I had given as my
reason. \

In .my letter l said that l was
resigning because » of the stress
caused by the Legal Awareness
Committee and because, as chair- ‘V
person‘ of the Student Relations
Committee, I felt it best to devote all
of my time and energy to performin _
the duties of that office. . I

i am enclosing with this letter a
copy of the letter l presentedto the
Student Government Board in the
hope that it will clear up any miscon-
ceptions of student government and
the Legal Awareness Committee
that may have been created by the.‘
incorrect quotation-

‘Student Government Board:

This is to inform.you that asof
Thursday, Oct. 8. 1981, l am resign-

I have been subject to stresses, both

Whilethesc difficulties have been

Kappa Sigma Responds  

Dear Editor,
This letter is written in respotise to

the letter published in The Pitt News '

Monday, October I9, I98], written
by the Lambda Chi Alpha f-rater-
nity. We, the brothers and pledges of
Kappa Sigma, feel deeply obligated
to clarify the many misconceptions

alluded to in the contents of that
'_- article. 1’

The term “ipledge” at Kappa
Sigma is one of honor and tradition.
A pledge is one who has accepted an
invitation from friends tosprepare

for membership in our fraternity. *

Pledging is a high honor and a
solemn responsibility. It is a time for
pride.) A commitment on the part of
the pledge comes with this invita-
tion. lt is in the keeping of this com-
mitment that the pledge shows
himself-worthy of the privileges ofa
brother. This commitment is one

that anyone would be proud to keep. .
It is symbolized by the pledge pin

which all of our pledges are honored
to wear.

At Kappa Sigma the goal of our
pledge education program is to
familiarize the pledge with the his-
tory, traditions, practices and work-
ings of the fraternity.
fraternity’s officers give lectures
explaining their duties. The pledges
learn the chapter bylaws and consti-
tution as well as fraternity songs.
They discuss scholarship and alcoh-
olism. All education is in order to

. prepare the pledges to be good

The‘

brothers, and for them to showthe

brothers that they truly desire to be
members and will take the responsi-

bility of brotherhood as well as the

privileges. it is the duty ofthe pledge
trainer ,to run this program, and
work with the pledges, not to
“...teach them to jump through
flaming hoops..‘."’. At the end of the
pledge education period, the pledges
will be totally prepared for our initi-

ation rites, which are based on a rit-.

ual coming from centuries of secret
work. I

Kappa Sigma  a very proud and V‘

elite organization, and we take great
pains to insure that our chapter will

remain among the best. This is why‘

‘we are so selective and require so

much ofour pledges. All pledges and '

brothers must strive to earn the Star
and Crescent, the badge of Kappa
Sigma, for:

i “The Star andvCrescent shall not
be worn by everyman, but only by
him who is worthy to wear it. He
must be a gentleman...a man of
honor and courage...a man of zeal.
yet humble...an intelligent man..la
man of truth...one who tempers
action with wisdom and, above all
else, one who walks in the light of
God.” A

student-athletes actually bala' V
big-time athletics with academic
requirements ilfvolves questioning
commitments———~-———ones_Mmade both
by the student and the university
that accepted him or her.

‘ "Each year. Pitt admits large
numbers of students who are
expected to commit themselves to
their particular sport and to fulfill
their academiejequirements.

But whether these students do
this --—- and whether or ‘not they
even can —-— depends to a large
extent on the university’s commit-
ment to them;

“Athletes, as a group, are roughly
the same as the rest of the student
body in terms of graduation rates."

‘.and

M “Every kid on that field, some-

‘~ ?_ (“In the course of_ four years in

T " whatgotthem here this far. ”’

—-agcurrent Pitt football player
Because. they are given scho- '

i”lars.hips primarily to flex their

‘muscles on a playing field. one
collld argue there is. from the
start, an inherent bias injected
into an athlete’s approach to col-
legiate life and the quandriy of
juggling the demands of academ-
ics and athletics.

”Which isn't meant to suggest
that athletes i are discouraged

from flexing their minds in the

classroom. in fields that aren’t
make of astroturf. Far from it.
Even if a coach harbors no deep
concern over the academic
growth of his athletic understu—
d/ies. it is inhis best interests to
"keep an athlete academically
eligible. a prerequisite to keeping
them on the playing field.

i The pressure to win can, how-
ever, create a double-edged
sword..out ofa mechanism origi-
nally installed to protect _

. athletes——such academic rules
requirements at once
encourage academic progress
and invite abuses.

At Pitt. the coaches and ath-°
letes contacted for the purposes
ofthis article generally agree that
a university has the responsibil-
ity to provide its student-athletes
with academic supportive servi-
ces. They also generally agree
that once such opportunities are
provided, the larger burden falls
on the individual athlete to take
advantageon the help available.

Or. as Pitt football Coach
Jackie Sherrill says, “I can moti-
vate players--~,that’s my area of
expertise. The advisors and peo-
ple‘ in academia are the people
that have to motivate kids aca-

gdemically."

Sherrill ~'a_.'< he prefers to limit
his role ir.  -thlctc‘s academic
life to one tvl cncouragment and
advice. He says from the start.
Pitt football players are advised
'where to go if they .need aca-
demic help. A

l a choice between having a kid on

'can’t help you (academically).

Choices

Other than that. Sherrill.
says he avoids involving himself A
with an athletes academics to dif-
fuse any conflicts of iinterieistim 

“When l became coachhere in
l977, I said I wanted the respon-
sibility (for athleteis academic
progress) placed on the academic
people," Sherrill said. “I try to
stay out of it. At every other
school in the country. academic
advisors that advise students and
monitor students are directly
hired by the athletic department.
We don't do that here."

Why not‘? Sherrill says such a
practice insulates him from hav-
ing to make a decision on an ath-
lete’s academics that may be the
best thing for the football team
but not necessarily in the best
interest on the student. .

"To be honest. if I had to make

the practice field, orhaving him
go take a test. as acoach l’d want
him- on the field. This way, I
don't have a choice." Sherrill
maintains. ‘
Which leavesthe choice up to
the players. who are not always
the best equipped to make such
decisions. Especially in sports
where professional opportunities
after college exist---such as pro

football and (basketball ,
With the likelihood of an ath-

lete making it to the pros an
extreme longshot at best, such
delusions can be ,dangerous——
and tragic. as the football player
quoted at the start of this article
pointed out. 4
“I know someone who isn‘t too
happy now. He told me once that
he didn‘t care about school. He
said he was goingto the NFL. He
didn‘t make it. Where is he now‘?
l know several guys like that who
thought they were going to make
‘it in the pros. It didn‘t work out.
“When you put all your mar-
bles into anything you do and it
doesn’t work out its tragic.
That‘s the only word for it.“
Says another football player:
"lf you don‘t really care. they

It's a matter of getting off your
tail and goingland getting the
help. If you‘rc counting on mak-
ing it big in the pros. maintain
(your academics) or else you‘rc

Irwin Schulman said. “But there are

special problems."
i The “special problems" occur.
mainly on the football team, where
extraordinary time commitments
and pressures. combined with the
lure of profootball. results in fewer
players graduating.

Schulnlan said last year there was
a drop in graduation rates on the
team. But last year was all outstand-
ing year for Panther seniors,l2 of
whom were drafted by pro teams.
Its a considerable compliment to
the athletic department but a dam-
aging blow to convincing a student-
athlete ofthe importance ofa college
degree. ll
“While they're here, they don’t lfstep
to us. They all have their ‘dreams.’

. And when you have a year like you

had last year. it makes it even
harder," Schulman said. _
The contradiction between the

“purposes of a university and the

devt4i'6ﬁlhehi‘b‘fiiah athletic program

sity is going to have to live with
Schulman said.

‘‘It’s a trade-of." he said “Big-

The univcrsity’s part is the accep-
tance of athletes who are not aca-
demically well-prepared. “We admit

extra assistance. make it." Schul-
man said.

This means Pitt provides certain

that athletes get “special treatment"

that addresses a variet_y o_/academic,

pose of this courseis to help you

There is a special sectionaof CAS

“They have the same career

which puts us in a strange position."

things that help a person achieve
regardless of what field he is in. The
class talks about time management
(“Football players practice 36-40
hours a week. Few students can

remains of whether or not the uni-
versity can even reach them.

“Most students are led to believe
they have a serious shot at the pros."
Applbaum said. “in order to be
good players, they have to develop
confidences in themselves and their
abilities. Sometimes they lose sight
of their real abilities. _They ‘don‘t
think about the other options that
are available to them.

“I tell them the options that are

available to them. but l don‘t
threaten them. And l don’t make
any judgments. I lead people to
make judgments for themselves."

Applbaum said he perceives he is
able to reach some. but notiall ofhis
students. "The freshmen starters are
one group that I don‘t reach.” he
said. “They have careers that are
almost guaranteed.“ These athletes.
Applbaum said. are recruited by Pitt

«-

Advising, Counseling .

When students consider careers.
they weigh their options: what
they’re interested in, what the benef-
its are. what’s required. When
student-athletes consider pursuing

.professional athletic careers, they

face a different kind ofdecision: how
much time and energy should they
put into academic work. when con-

 gntrating on athletics will result in

' greater financial and social status?
That dilemma is one of the con-
cerns of Paul- Yuna and Lloyd Wes-
ton. two former Pitt football
players. who are advisors in the
office of Support Services for
Athletes.
Support services, provides infor-
mal course counseling. personal
counseling. tutoring and other aca-

“demic services.

The office was established in I976

to assist athletes in graduating from
the university, making academic
progress and meetingtheir eligibility
requirements.

Yuna said support services deals
with about 230 athletes during the
co_urse of the year. half of all the

athletes at Pittflf a student needs a

particular service that support servi-
ces can’t provide. the office will
either refer the student to a place
where he can get the service or
develop a way to provide it. Yuna
said.

According to Yuna. time commit-
ment is a problem when students try
to balance their athletics and meet
their requirements. '

“Time factor is areal problem.”
Yuna said. “There's a tremendous
strain on their time.”

they do. They're smart people in the _g

sensethatthey know whatto do with
themselves. They can make careers
in-football. and'capitali7.e on their
names to succeed in other careers.

A second group—-the ones that
get a shot at the pros. but don’t make
it--are still well enough established
in the Pittsburgh area to have many
opportunities available to them.
One ex-Pitt football star became a
manager at Mellon Bank after work-

ing in the public relations depart-
ment. “They make a business on
their name. and in the process. learn
their place.“ Applbaum said.

A third group is the athletes who
are average performers on the field.
but who have high academic aspira-
tions. They apply the same princi-
ples they use in football (hard work.
perseverence. etc.) to academic life;
they graduate and they succeed.
Applbaum said the third group is

not the one about which he worries
the most.

“The ones I worry about are the
ones who come here and have no '
academic or other goals except for
football." Applbaum said. “They are
deceived people. They deceive them-
selves into believing they have a defi-
nite career in pro football, and they
have no, idea of the value of an
education.

“They are taken advantage of, and

, _l don’t know ifl reach them.“

Several athletes who received

‘V in fact. they didn’t. They had their

ic Success: Who’s Responsible? 

According to Applbaum. when a
student is admitted to Pitt. it consti-
tutes an agreement between the uni-
versity and the student. By
admitting a student. the university is
saying that it believes the student has
the ability to gain an education.

The college isn’t capable of deal-
ing with athletically gifted students
who have deficient academic back-
grounds. Applbaum said.

7 However. because the university
has admitted the student. it has an
obligation to educate. Therefore.
Applbaum believes that the univer-
sity isn‘t doing enough.

The

university. he
should confer with scholars of.edu-
cation who know the particular

suggested.

‘needs of the student-athlete and
come up with a way to meet those
needs.

Applbaum believes that Sqpport
Services for Athletes and the Learn-
ing Skills Center. which also pro-
vides services for athletes. have been
doing a good job. .

He said. howev\er. that Pitt could
do more. such as designing a pro-
gram for athletes similar to the U-
CEP program. where students
would be assigned teacher-
counselors who could address indi-
vidual problems. '

However. at‘ a university that
demic excellence while providing
ll2 for players on the football and
basketball teams.so many special
services for athletes opens the way
for charges of unfairness. There are
student organilations in which stu-
dents spend considerable amounts
of time doing considerably benefi-
Icwial things but receive no financial
reward. They see the fringe benefits
the athletes get. They claim the ath-
letes get special treatment.

'l o answer that criticism. /\ppl— ’

baum explains that the university
has an obligation to prmide those
scr\ict‘\; they are partial fulfillment
of the uni\ersit_\l's commitment to
the student-athletes.

“If they”re not going to spend the
resources to educate the student.

\

then thestudent shouldn’t have been
admitted." Applbaum said. “By
admitting him. the university agreed
to supply the resources necessary to
fulfill that students particular
needs."

lf Pitt were to design the special
type of program for athletes that
Applbaum has in mind. he thinks

Syracuse Job Rough; Marino Low-keys Heisman

Bry JOHHETTE HOWARD

Head.....:i7t):ich Dick MacPherson
admits ‘he and Syracuse football
have not had a happy union thus far
in MacPherson‘s first season. it's
been a “sad situation.” says Mac-
Pherson. _
; “Its just alike being married. At
first you say, “Is that the girl 1 mar-
ried?" MacPherson said, stretching
for asimile. Its the same thing
they're saying here...‘ls this the guy I
got for a coach?’ ”

Things, you see, haven’t exactly
turned out as expected for the Oran-
turned out as expected for the

returned l6 starters from last year's ‘

5—6~team, including running sensa-
tion Joe Morris, Syracuse’s all-time
leading rusher at a school that’ once
could call l.arry Csonka and Floyd

4, Little‘ its own.

The prospects for this 1981 season
were bright, and MacPherson,

plucked last December from the

p

coaching staff of the Cleveland
Browns to replace disgruntled
Frank Maloney, realizes how
quickly a l—4—l start has stunted the
fervor that surrounded the team
before the year began. '

“l~’ve been disappointed," Mac-
Pherson said yesterday over a tele-
phone hookup at Pitt's weekly

, football press conference. “lt’s been

difficult adjusting for the kids. We
have some different concepts on
what we want to do. We haven’t got
the job done.”
MacPherson’s problems, it seems,
are three—fold. ~
.The Orangemen's defense, says
MacP»her‘son, needs to get “more
speed, ability and strength.” With.-
out those three attributes, there‘s not
much left, which may explain why
Syracuse’s defense has given up an
average of 25 points per game.
Offensively, its been Joe Morris
again. And again. And again. The
tough, 5-7, I82-pound Morris con-

tinuespto be Syracuse‘s all—purpose -

Lady Panitheiris

By JOE KELLY

The Pitt Women’s Volleyball
team is on the move, taking West
Virginia University and Cleveland
State last evening at Pitt Field
House. .

The lady Panthers have won l7
of their last l9 games, including last
weekend‘s Illinois tournament. in
which some offthe countries’ top
teams participated. Pitt’s overall

, record now stands at 24-9.

“We didn‘t play really well against
West Virginia University,” said Pitt
Coach Shelton Collier. “We weren’t
as emotional as usual. Being still
high after the tournament win, we
weren't mentally prepared. This
showed against WVU.” V

West Virginia played a smooth.
tough match, but the Panthers sur-
vived l7—l5, l5—l() and l0-5. .

After this WVU match, Collier
called a team meeting. emphasizing
the fact emotion was lacking.

“The team meeting helped in the
second match. We played much bct~
tcr; especially o’ * game."
Collier said. “VVe ha .ot more
enthusiasm this time around."

match. Cleveland State. had

Not Hopeful

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

When Pitt quarterback D/an
Marino delivers an opinion of his
chances to win the Heisman Trophy,

college football‘s majo/r individual A

award,‘it’s as smooth and to the
point as one of his passes.

“I think winning it depends on
half promotion and half ability,”
Marino said. if

“I haven’t really thought about it. ‘

Its not my department.”

Marino acknowldeges that win-
ning the Heisman, awarded annu-
ally by the New York City
Touchdown Club to-..the nation’s

best collegiate football player,,

“would be great for me, the team and
the university." But he says he’s not
counting too heavily on his pros-
pects of winning the award. even
though liisstock has risen rapidly in
recent weeks with his standout pass~
ing effort as Pitt has climbed the

“People want to know why we‘re

Marino said: “They look and say.

An injury, however, caused Pitt’s

According to Lacaria, the condi-

a factor in most of the matches".

Lee,Higgins Run Strong in WVU

Pitt Lady Panthers Margie Lee
and Sally Higgins continued to lead
the way for the'women‘s cross coun-
try team with an impressive showing
at last weekends 5-kilometer West
Virginia Open Invitational. Several
track clubs. as well as local colleges,
participated in the open meet.

Against the biggest field of the
season, Lee and Higgins sifted
through the large pack of runners
- then turned on the speed to finish

eighth and l2th respectively Satur-
day. Both girls’ showings impressed
first-year Pitt Coach Elbert
\ Kennedy. -
“Margie has been running well all

y year and Sally has looked great,”

.iKennedy said.

N While- the consistently strong
showing this season by Lee, a senior,
is nothing new--she finished in the

'top five’ in this year’s Pittsburgh-

Great Race ~- Higgin’s showings this
season have provided Pitt with a
good one-two punch in most meets.

Higgins has been primarily a
middle-distance runner here at Pitt.

concentrating on the 880-yard run
for the track team. although she did
run cross country during her years at
Avon High School. Her emergence

I this year on the cross country team,

Kennedy said, was not unexpected,‘

“She didn’t surprise me. although
I _.v‘/think she surprised herself,”
Kennedy said. “She’s been great in
practice all year. She has confidence
now. Shejust needs more strength to
‘run the races."

According to Kennedy, Higgins
has room for even more improve-
ment if she can successfully build up
enough ‘strength to deal with the
l0.000-meter cross country courses.
Such strength. Kennedy says, must
come with time.’

“Its a short season and you can’t I

work too hard too fast. or you risk
the chance of injury. She starts off
great in a race, but she loses some-
thing in the last part of the course.“
Kennedy said.

Kennedy is looking forward to
getting Higgins, a igunior. back on
the cross country team next year. He

Time: 5:30 pm

feels that with some additional off-

season work‘. Higgins could be the .
team leader next season when Lee is

gone. p

Also competing for Pitt at the
WVU meet were Melanie McCallis-
ter, Barb Billick and Kathy Budway.
The threefinished in a cluster, nail-
ing down 28th. 29th and 30th places
respectively. Winning the meet was
the Slippery Rock team, a Division
ll powerhouse. followed bythe host-
ing WVU.

‘The Lady Panther teamlwill run
its last competition Nov. I in the

Park. The race will cover 3.] miles,

quite a bit shorter thanltheitradi- /

tional cross country course ofjust

Clancy Dropped

By AMlN GHOSSEIN

The man who was the heart
and soul of the Pitt Panther bas-
ketball team for four years will
not be a Phoenix Sun. The‘N BA
club announced earlier this week
that it had trimmed its roster to
the required l2 with the dismissal
of former Pitt star Sam Clancy.

Clancy, the all-time Pitt
rebounder..and one of the most
popular athletes everto attend
Pitt, , eouldn‘t crack tlkprofes
sional club due to a number of
reasons. K

In college, Clancy,\6-7. 245-
pounder, was the enforcer on the
boards and a tough man inside.
With a football—like body,
Clancy could outmuscle oppo-
nents and score points. He found
that in the pros more is needed
than muscle. ’ ‘

Never a great shooter, Clancy
had trouble scoring in the_Suns’
exhibition games as evidenced by

l8 ‘points in five games. But..the
problems stemmed deeper.

“We liked Sam’s body, but his
inside play was inconsistent. His

shooting was also erratic!” Suns‘
assistant coach John Wetzel
said.
Without much ofan offensive
game, Clancy‘s hustle and

Wacky Baseball Season Could Have Been Worse

y AMIN GHOSSEIN

Too bad the Expos didn’t win the
National League championship.

Could you picture the scenario:

In the first game ofthe World Ser-
ies. only 20.000 fans showed up as
temperatures dipped into the '20s.
Undaunted. Baseball Commissioner
Bowie Kuhn wore an “l Love Base-
ball“ T-shirt. While the Yankees
were winning Game Onc.lKuhn had
to be rushed to the hospital forfrost—
bite after the sixth inning.

The courageous Kuhn" watched

‘ﬁe rest ofthe game from his hospital

bed and told reporters that the
weather was “refreshing" and the
frostbite wasn't really frostbite but a
bad case of allergies. Doctors soon
after gave Kuhn a sedative.

For Game Two. the weather in
Montreal reached the refreshing
level of l9 degrees. which forced the
cancellation of the game. Ticked off
by the cancellation. Kuhn called the
players “Sissies" for not being able
to take a little cold. Still in his hospi-
tal bed. doctors had to give him
another sedative as Kuhn was
alledgedly trying to sneak out ofthe
hospital to get to the ballpark.

1..The scene shifts to New York for

Game Threelwhere Yankee owner
George Steinbrenner berates Reggie
Jackson for dropping a fly ball in
warm-ups and confiscatcs Jackson‘s
stereo in the locker room. Jackson
assures the press everything is
alright.

While Steinbrenner assures the
media that the incident was nothing
since Jackson‘s butt is gone after this

1 year anyway. The Yankees go out

Feeney in the commissioners box.
Doctors gave him a sedative.

Game Four is played on a Satur-
day. Montreal wins 4-3. Kuhn
watches USC trounce Notre Dame
in football on another channel.
After the game. he tells a gathering
of the media that baseball is still
/\merica’s pastime.

With the winds gusting up to 25
miles per hour and the wind chill
factor causing temperatures to drop
into the teens. Kuhn returns to Yan-
kee Stadium for Game Five and

watches the Yankees win on a passed
ball.

Montreal catcher Gary Carter
said he couldn‘t grip the ball any-
more and just wanted to go to the
dugout. Umpires gave Steve Rogers
a warning in the seventh inning for
wearing earmuffs.

Kuhn. attired in an electrically-
heated sports jacket. described the
weather as “deceptively warm."

The Yankees lead the series three
games to two but are still feuding.

Graig Nettles hit a first-inning

 

home run to win the game. and all of
the Yankees shook his hand except
for Jackson. Nettles called the snub-
bing “unfortunate.“ while Jackson
said he didn't realize Nettles had hit
it out.

Back in Montreal for Game Si-x. '

where the weather reached zero
degrees. Kuhn ordered the teams to
play. While a noisy crowd of l0.000
watched. the game was called off in
the third inning when Steinbrenner
threw an ice ball at his catcher Rick
Cerone. Cerone responded by whiz-
zing an ice ball of his own. which

g accidentally hit Kuhn. Rushed tothe

hospital. the commissioner is
reported to be in excellent condi-
tion. Doctors had to give Kuhn a
sedative after he ordered the death
penalty for Cerone.

A relaxed Kuhn came out for
Game Six of the series. The weather
was a balmy 43 degrees as both
teams took the field. The commis-
sioner. before the game. had gone
over to Cerone to apologize for the
death penalty and reduced it toa $50
fine.

Cerone then put his arm around
Kuhn and called the whole thing a
“giant misunderstanding." Oh. by
the way. the Yankees lost the game
I—() as Bill l.ec pitched a three—hitter.

Alter the game. Steinbrenner be-
rated the team for two hours and
told the media “that he could hit Lee

any day." An exhibition was imme-

diately set up and the Yankee owner
hit three Lee pitches out of the ball-
park and made solid Contact on
seven other pitches. Steinbrenner

offensive line that ranks as one ofthe
stronger points on an otherwise
weak team.

“Morris had done everything you
could want from a running back,”
MacPherson said. But it hasn‘t been
enough. “We’ve had trouble putting
points on the board," admits the
down-cast coach. L

To complicate matters, ‘Syracuse

the No.2 Pitt Panthers at Pitt Sta-
dium barely regrouped and still feel-
ing the bruises. But if playing the
nation’s top two teams on successive
weedends is a heart—wrenching
assignment for Syracuse, a team
already gone South, MacPherson
refuses to use it as a outlet to vent his
woes. Even if it's a prime
opportunity.

“I think it's good for us. That’s
where we want to be, up with Pitt
and Penn State. That‘s what we

jiiiiwhope to attain here," MacPherson

said. “We wantto rise to their level.”

Its a level that the Pitt Panthers
themselves didn’t honestly expect to
achieve so soon when this season of
unknowns began. And if MacPher-
son is languishing in his current
trappings at Syracuse, Pitt Coach
Jackie Sherrill is enjoying his perch
at the moment.

In the lapse ofa fortnight, Sherrill
has gone from a reluctant appraiser
to a staunch believer in his team’s
chances at the national title. Two
weeks ago, Sherrill opined that he
thought the team was “still a year
away” from the championship; Sat-

 urday, after Pitt’s convincing 42-14

'3‘ i.

win over llth-ranked Florida State,
he was setting his sights on it.

“I don’t know if we don’t deserve
to be No.1," Sherrill said.

Yesterday, Sherrill admitted the
rise and evolution of his young team
‘into a championship contenderw
‘the top contender a.t the moment—-
has been one wrought with

. enjoyment.

“If we can keep going, we can be
the Cinderella team,” Sherrill said.
“When things come unexpectedly,
you always enjoy it more‘. lfthere are
high expectations. you have to try to
live up to it.

Not thatthe pressure is off now.

Wwtﬂherrill said he told his players Sun-

\ , _...-

"<\

 

day that they’re “no longer playing
for fun. The pressure is on now
where we are." .

But the pressure ign’t so intense
it’s buckling the knees of any Panth-

ers. As Sherrill pointed out, Pitt’s .

players are experienced in dealing
with the tension a high raking
means. ‘.

The players, to a man. maintain
the polls don't mean that much now.

It’s what they say in January that

counts. They also rate the chances of

letdown against a lesser foe like Syr-

acure an unlikely calamity. _

“We‘re moving up, but we still

flander Barry Compton. “No one is
thinking people are going to drop
over because we‘rc No.2”

Not even Syracuse, which is still
looking for win No.2.

last night. The emotionally-renewed
Panthers were ready for the Cleve-
land test, sweeping them l5-5, l5-7
and IS-2.

“The -Cleveland match will be a
help in preparing us for two upcom-
ing major matches, Penn State and
Rutgers, on Oct. 30 and 3l," said
Collier.

The Penn State match will be
Pitt’s chance fo revenge oftheir early

. season loss to the Lady Lions.

Rutgers, however, shapes up to be
the most important future match.
Although the Lady Panthers have
beaten them once this season,
Rutgers stands to be the major
threat to Pitt’s bid for the regional
championships.

Collier believes that Pitt must‘

again show that they are the better
team, thus giving them a slight edge
in the regionals.

Since the tournament win, Collier
believes that the Lady Panthers have

‘been playing excellent volleyball,

although there is still much room for
improvement. The team’s goal is to

Among the casualties are Ieva
Bergins. a part-‘time starter who left
the team for personal reasons,
Maria Perez, a starter who has
injured her knee, and starter Robin
Kukalis who has injured her
shoulder.

Despite the loss of such key play-
ers, Pitt has remained strong. Shel-
ley Riemersema and Judy Young, a
freshman, have done great in ﬁlling
in and have won starting positions
due to their play. Linda Stadler has
also risen to the occasion.

“She has recently played better
than ever.“ Collier said. “She was
fantastic at the Illinois tournament.
When she is at the top of her game,
our team can be great.”

Julie Gaul has also been a key I

figure. Her setting, blocking, and
defense have been excellent as of late
in the absence of Perez, Pitt’s usual
setter. .
The Lady Panthers next play at
Robert Morris College Oct. 24.
Their opponents will be Robert
Morris and Duquesne University.
Although these are not two of the

more powerful teams on the sche-

dule, they will be helpful in prepar-

much talent as Namath and Stabler
had."

Lest you think Sherrill’s outlook
maybe biased. the praise has been
rolling in from opposing coaches as
well. Floride State Coach Bobby
Bowden. after last week’s game
called Marino “the domirltant quar-

terback in college football today.” ‘

It’s a fact not lost on Pitt’s sports
information office and football
Sports Information Director Joyce
Aschenbrenner. who says plans are
in the works to draw nationwide
attention to Marino and his so—far
shimmering performances.

“This year, there hasn‘t been one
clear-cut person (in..contention for
the Heisman) that‘s taken charge.
That’s the way we‘re looking at it."
Aschenbrennér said. “This year.
since Danny was a junior. we origi-
nally planned tojust try and get him
some votes this year and then gear

1 . , up for-his last year. But-the way
things are'going. this year he has a .

chance. He‘s done so well."

According to Aschcnbrenner. her
office has been getting frequent
phone calls from writers fromacross
the nation inquiring about Marino
and asking for more statistical infor-
mation. Since it is writers who vote
on the trophy. Aschenbrenncr is
more than happy to oblige them.

"The idea is to draw attention to a
player. He‘s already well known and
to an extent, he’s doing it for him-
self." she said. “Publicity alone
doesn't win it for a player. You have
to have ability.”

Although plans are underway to
put together a campaign trumpeting
Marino for the Heisman. Aschen-
brenner says that Pitt has no inten-
tion of repeating the publicifiy blitz. it
staged last year for Hugh Green. The

pitch on Green’s » behalf featured

4.000 full—_color posters. at a cost of
353000-5000. listing everything from
his neck si7e to his shoe size.

Heisman Not Pressing Issue With Marino

for a defensive player. Marino‘s
case. Aschnebrenner maintains. will
be different.

“Hugh‘s was a special. case
because a defensive player hadinever
won it before."she said. “We‘ll prob-
ably put together a pamphlet or
something for Danny. but there
aren’t . any grandiose plans right
now."

Unless you consider Dan Marino
dressed in prize-fighter regalia
grandiose it’s one of theiideas the
sports information office has tenta-
tively discussed with Marino.

"They ‘mentioned having me pos-
ing in a boxing robe and shorts with
boxing gloves. coming down the sta-
dium steps or something." Marino
said. “The slogan would be some-
thing like ‘Dan Marino is a
contende 

-Does Marino think it will help his
chances‘?

‘‘It‘s not my department. That‘s
what they tell me. The award is sup-
posed to represent the best player in
the country. but a lot of times thats
false,” Marino said. ‘‘It’s based on

the standpoint of who gets the most A

yr‘ 

publicity. It’s a’ matter of spending’ ‘

the money. sending out the pictures.
and letting guys in Arizona and Mis-
sissippi know about you.”

Marino considers‘his stiffest com-
petition two running backs-—
Georgia‘s sophomore sensation
Herschel Walker and Southern Cal
tailback Marcus Allen. He _says
although it’s a compliment just
being considered for the award, he
rates his chances of winning the
Heisman as slim. Unless...

“We’d probably have to go all the
way for me to win it. ‘Personally. I-
don’t think I
chance." Marino said. “Its not
really important when youcome
down to it. It doesn’t make you a

have much L0f a  ‘

better person. It‘s more important '

how the team does." Which isn't to
say that Marino would remain indif-
ferent if he were to somehow carry
away the award.

“I guess it would numb me for a
while." he said, chuckling. “I haven‘t
really thought about it.

“I just worry about playing week
to week." he said,

If he continues to play at the same
level of adeptness. he could be his

own one-man publicity machine.

  Hustlingi Hagenbuch 

“A Soccer Asset

By LISA GRENEVICKI

Panther .Iohn Hagenbuch is hus-
tling and the Pitt soccer team keeps
on winning.

As ajunior. Hagenbuch holds the
right halfback spot. According to

$ . 5. him. his build. size and play are good
ﬁsffor the position.

“I didn't have theisize (only 5'8”
and I45 lbs.) torbe a defensive, full-
back and my shooting ability wasn‘t
good enough to be a wing or striker
at my high school. so I fit right in at

. the halfback spot. I can control the
ball pretty well and this helps a lot.
This allows me to make good passes

and set guys up for a goal. I get a lot’

of assists from it.” he said.
“As right halfback. my job is to
support the right wing and fullback.
If my wing is in trouble. I‘m there to
pass the ball back to. and if my full-
back has to plug up the middle. I
ii"“j£<)v'er his side. I‘m also there to help
 dut the scoring attack by giving
assists." I
Hagenbuch comes from Trinity in’
Washington. Pa. 'I‘rinit'y‘s coach.
Art Richardson. had a big influence

on Hagenbuch‘s early soccer career. _

“Richardson is an excellent
coach." said Hagenbuch. He’s a
good. strong discipliner. He wants

. l()()‘,’(' V from everyone. He really
pushed me to hustle."

And hustle he does. Called “Mr.
Hustle" by some of his teammates.
Hagenbuch covers a lot of ground
from his halfback position.

“Hustle is the stronger part of my
game." said Hagenbuch. “I really
/ on’t think I have exceptional ball
handling skills like someofour play-
ers; but my skills areiimproving.
What I don't have in skill. I try to
make up ‘for in hustle."

i As a halfback. Hagenbuch does
plenty of running during a game.

“A halfback needs a lot ofhustle."

. said Hagenbuch. “We probably do
the most running on the field."

Hagenbuch’s hustle and aggres-

, sive play has earned ‘him three goals
and four assists so far this season.
with a streak of two goals in the last
two games.

"I've played much better this year.
I‘ve gotten the chance to play and

A ou improve by getting playingtime.

ive been scoring recently and that

I has given me a lot of confidence.

\ You get a lot of drive to score.“

The Panther hooters will need
.Hag'enbuch’s scoring drive as they
face some of their stiffest‘ competi-
tion in the coming weeks.

“We‘re going to be playingsome
tough teams. Ever_\'one‘s going to

have to play their very best. We'll
need to be really psyched up. Fifty
percent of it is in your mind. It's how
hard you want it.

“Having a winning season and a
shot at the conference championship
gives you the confidence to win.
We'll have to get good goals early on
and play as a team to have a chance."

With the I981 season almost atan‘
end. Hagenbuch is looking forward
to next year.

“We're building up an excellent
team for next year. I wantto do my
best to contribute. I would like to get
more goals and more assists. I want
to help the team win games that we
haven‘t been able to.“

What ever happens to the 'Pitt
soccer team this season. Hagenbuch
says it’s all worth it.

“I’ve developed a strong. healthy ‘

body from running so much. It gives
you discipline.’\he commented.

“I get pleasure out of playing
soccer. I’m an engineering student
and classes can get you down. I go
out on the field and forget all the
pressures for a while. Besides. it
givesyou a good feeling to know
vou‘re involved in a sport "
