Bench to Quarterback,

By GENE AROMATORIO .

A backﬁeld made up of four halfbacks may not be the
fad but it is the latest thing for the Panthers. At least this
will be the case when Coach Red Dawson sends his Panthers
against Notre Dame’s mighty Irish before 62,000 Stadium
fans at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow.

The newest addition "to the halfback backﬁeld is sopho-
more Corny Salvaterra. Dawson, in an effort to bolster the
Panther offense, which has scored only 14 points in two
games, has given the nod for the:
quarterback spot to Salvaterra

With the Panther passing attack

Trustee Coniinittee Formed
To Interview A p plicants,

~ M ake Recommendations 

A ﬁve man trustee committee has been set up to review I

candidates and make formal recommendations to the full
Board of Trustees concerning a successor to Chancellor Rufus
H. Fitzgerald. The committee is headed by Leon Falk Jr.

Chancellor Fitzgerald will retire July 1, 1954 [after head- If i_ _
ing the University administration for ten years. He has been j

at Pitt for the past 17 years.

Besides Mr. Falk the trustee committee consists of Mar-
cus A. Follansbee, president of Follansbee steel corporation,
J . Henry O’Neill, local attorney, A. W. Robertson, chairman
of the ﬁnance committee of Westinghouse corporation, and

The new chancellor, when selected, will be announced
immediately after his acceptanceﬁ
Although formal nominations to
‘the Board of Trustees will be
made only by the trustee commit-
tee, other committees representing
University faculty, and adminis-
tration have been invited to assist
the trustee officials gather infor-
mation about possible candidates
and suggest candidates for consid-
eration.

Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dean
of the college, Dr. G. R. Fitterer,
dean of the Schools of Engineering
and Mines, and Dr. Vincent W.
Lanfear, dean of the School of
Business Administration, h a v e
been appointed as administration
representative. ‘

The executive committee of the
University Senate has elected Dr.
George Crouch, professor of Eng-
lish, Dr. Mary Warga, professor of
physics, and Dr. Peter Gray, pro-
fessor of zoology, to represent the
faculty.

Qualifications for the chancel-
lorship will be ability, experience,
and vision to build on the achieve-

construction and will add to the
physical plant of the University
resulting in a bigger job for the
new chancellor. Within the past
few years the University has ex-
panded to such an extent that it
was necessary for Dr. Fitzgerald
to appoint two vice-chancellors,
Dr. Robert" Moore and Dr. Charles
V. Nutting.

Mr. Falk said that “the chancel-
lorship of the University of Pitts-
burgh is one of the top educational
jobs in the country. Through the
years it has been held by men of
outstanding talents. We shall leave
nothing undone to find . . . a man
whose qualifications assure the
University’s continued leadership
in education’ and in the develop-
ment of this great industrial city
and community.”

While the committees are work-
ing to find his successor, Chancel-
lor Fitzgerald announced that he
will, continue his usual line of
work. He saidethat he doe_s,'not'

Alice Travels Through
European ‘F airyland.’

Student Sees Bright Lights of Paris and
Works in Fieldskwith Yugoslav Relatives

By BARBARA CHERINGTON

Alice Smolkovich, president of WSGA, became’ an “Alice
in Wonderland” for 6 weeks this summer as a result of win-
ning the Nationality Rooms Hostess Award. .

“The beautiful sight of sidewalk cafes and bright lights”
in‘ Paris was one of the wonders which Alice saw after sail-

ing from Quebec to England with 70 students and spending

a short six days in London.
Her travels continued with a
train ride on the Oriental Ex-

. press to Yugoslavia. At the end

of “delightful hours of seeing

flat land, French villages, and
the green, snowless alps,” Alice
arrived at her grandmother’s
home in Celje, in N. Yugoslavia.

Her encounters with people who
spoke English were few. Although
her year of studying German at
Pitt helped considerably, her
younger Yugoslavian cousins had
the edge on her.

Unassuming People

In Celje, a city of white cot-
tages and red tile roofs, Alice re-
mained three weeks. During that
time, she traveled to Belgrade to
see the University of Belgrade, a
modern building, and the place
where the Danube meets the Save
River. “Yugoslavia is a country
of many different cities,” says
Alice, “with unassuming people,
who have little knowledge of the
cosmetics of American girls.” The
women wear aprons and babush-
kas for all occasions.

Alice’s adventures continued
as she rode by in a train to
Zagreb, to the home of her fa-
ther’s brothers and sister.
Though she had never seen
them before, Alice recognized
her relatives‘ by‘ their close
similarity to her father. She
experienced getting up at 3:30
a.'m. with the others to eat corn

bread and to work in the ﬁelds,
using old farm equipment.

Speaking of movieland, the sen-‘
ior education major mentions a
movie which had cyrillic alphabet
subtitles, “Vunder-schon Frijoles.”
This meant “Magic Beans” or
“Jackand the Bean Stalk” to us,
she explained.

Sees Saint-Chapelle

Sight-seeing through Europe
included visits to the oldest church
in Zagreb; Saint-Chapelle, which
is the chapel after which Pitt’s
Heinz Chapel is modeled; the
canals or “streets” of Venice; and
Versailles, city of peace-treaty
fame.

She also saw many museums in
the big cities, the Louvre, Notre
Dame, and the ruins of bombed
cities such as East Berlin. Along
her journey Alice met Pitt stu-
dents Pat Baird twice, and Sam
Seigle, who was studying in Rome,
once.

On Sept. 1, shortly after her
21st birthday, which she spent
with her grandmother in Yugo-
slavia, Alice returned to the
United States and Pitt full of
many wonderful tales. Her opin-
ion of the European people is
that they are “friendly and
ready to help foreigners.”

Like possibly any fictional Alice
returning from “Wonderland” her
wish for the future is that she
have the chance to “return to
Europe again}? —

eturn Again

YUGOSLAV FOLK songs are
played by Alice Smolkovich as
a test of what she has learned
during her summer abroad. She
is accompanied by the chairman
of Pitt’s Yugoslav room, left, and
by her sister, Mildred, who is

   

singing in Yugoslavian.

This is one of the things that
has made Alice appreciate her
own background. The accordion
she is playing is similar ‘to the
one which her grandparents got
her in Yugoslavia.

Fifth Hour

For the ﬁrst time since pre-world war II days the Pitt
student body has a free ﬁfth hgur. ‘Student reaction to this
ruling has been sharply critical since the immediate result

has been conjestion on the ground floor, in the tuck shops,
andat otherppoints where students gather.

Since the milling multitudes have kept these critics

from stepping bagk, they have beenunable to viewthe

overall effect of the move. , .
The‘fraternity factions have been one of the first groups

Tito‘ utilize the ‘hour. By serving lunches at their houses they

have usedjthe ﬁfth hour to strengthen their internal struc-
ture; Other groups have followed suit and are beginning
to‘ realize the_reward_s- made possible by utilization of the

‘hour.

- ‘But, perhaps the biggest point in favor of the free hour
is the fact that it gives the commuter time to see the Uni-

Tomorrow will ﬁnd Pitt Stadium with anextra-capacity
crowd of 62,000 persons. Bleacher seats have been set up
in the end zone sections to handle the "overflow. The vast
majority will be nonstudents. A, high percentage of this
majority will be cheering for the Panther opponents.

These facts and surmises indicate‘ that Pitt will start
as underdogs playing before a crowd -which is expecting
the Panther to go down to defeat. ,

Under such circumstances it is inevitable that critical
attention will be bent not only u on the téam’s performance
but also upon the students’ performance with regard to
support given the team. ' .

A university is judged on its student body, not on its

football team an_d tomorrow there will be 62,000 judges
sitting in the stands. a I’

Illegal Entry Charged

The Greeks may soon be in-
vaded by immigration officials
for harboring alien trout. Ac-.
cording to legislation passed near

the ‘end of the Congressional ses-..
sion ﬁnes up to $10,000 and long‘

jail sentences
would be in
the offing.

ant can avoid

ly by promi-
nently d i s -
playing on the
wall a sign
a n n o u n cing
t h a.t foreign
trout is being
served. T h a t
is of course, if it does serve for-
eign trout. That’s what the bill’s
about. 
Thanks to wiser members of
the House of Representatives on-
ly a sign is required where it
might have been necessary to list
the ﬁsh and their respective
countries on the menus.

Passport Please

Representative H a m e r H.
Budge, Idaho Republican,‘ is chief
sponsor of the bill that would re-
quire restaurant owners to desig-
nate where’ their ﬁshcame from.
He reluctantly accepted a com-

 

 

to picture a “poor little Danish

     

promise which called for only
the sign. '

’I don’t know where the Greeks
buys its ﬁsh, but if‘ it ‘purchases
from Danish and Japanese enter-
prisers,'it is one of the reasons
why American trout r a i s e r s
claimed lower proﬁts, the past
year.

Sen. Henry C. Dworshak, Idaho
Republican, late of the second
Congressional district, is in ca-
hoots with his Western buddy
as Senate sponsor of the bill. He
explains his support of the pro‘-
posal, “I just wanted to give con“-

' sumers the same protection they

enjoy in buying garments with
the wool content on the label.’_’

Both Idaho men are backed in
their bid for fair not fowl ﬁsh by
20 citizens employed in four trout
hatcheries in Mr. Budge’s dis-
trict. The representative at-
tempted to rally ﬁshing fanciers
to his cause when he claimed that
foreign, enterprise would so push
American hatcheries out of busi-
ness they wouldn’t be able to
stock favorite streams with ﬁn-
gerlings.

Swimming Suckers

From the ranks of the opposi-
tion,‘ Rep. Emmanuel Celler,
N.Y. Democrat ,, asked the House

 

‘

an important step toward blow. W

out protection. W v
. The National Hot ‘Rod Associa-
tion, formed in 01951, has aided
in the founding of more than
2,700 hotrod clubs. Even Van-
couver, British Columbia, boasts
a clu membershipof 355.

Not All Professional

Of course there are some local
unofﬁcial members who take just
as much pride in. their hot rods.
Their specially equipped engines
must be complete with highspeed
universal joints, cut down chrome
heads, and filed points.

And the ‘genuine hep cat does
not consider his vehicle,accept-
able until the continental, fender

signals, and spoked rims are in- ,

eluded.

A hot rodder knows that he has
found success when, in ﬁrst gear,
he chugsqpast a 54 Mercury on
the highway at 130 MPH. And he
can tell from the baffled look in
his direction thathe is driving a
completely unrecognizable 1940
Ford-

boy ﬁsh” swimming across the
ocean for a rendezvous with an
American ﬁsh in the St. Lawrence
river. The result—--more family
ﬁns to feed. - .
~ “Now I ask you,” Mr. Celler
shouted, “what nationality would
they be?”
The New Yorker feared for the

restaurant owner who made ge- .

fulte ﬁsh, and included many va-
rieties of ﬁsh from different coun-
tries.

Past Rep. Laurie Battle, Ala-
bama Democrat, opposed the bill
for the precedent it might set.

International Edibles

“Imagine if a menu had to
read Long Island duck served
with Alabama sweet potatoes,
sweetened with ,Louisiana cane
sugar, with Brazilian coffee, Wis-
consin cream and bread made of
Kansas ﬂour.”»

Before congress adjourned, the
item was placed in a conference
committee to coordinate House
and Senate versions of the bill.
Quite possibly the committee will
consider also the proposed color
of the sign, and I would suggest
aqua. .

And God save the proprietor if
his place should be visited by the
Daughters of the American Rev-
olution, once the sign has been
"posted. ‘ ‘ ’

Debut Here Tomorrow

BY JOEL MERENSTEIN »

That many fans can’t be wrong. Sixty-thousand spirited
American football fans will view tomorrow’s «Pitt game, al-
though it may not be a close game and probably won’t de-
cide the National Championship. But, it’s Pittsburgh’s top
event of the week and “the game” on Pitt’s schedule. Notre

Titans To Test

Harrier Power
By STEVE BUTCHOCK

Westminster’s Titans will at-
tempt to snap the Pitt harriers win
streak at the Schenley Park course
tomorrow morning at 10:30 a. m.,
but the dopesheet favors the
Olsonmen to capture their third
straight meet of the young season
and number twelve over a two-

makes its ﬁrst appearance here since 1951.

Notre Dame, the University with
the French name, the Irish spirit,
and the American will to win ex-
cites the average fan and fright-
ens the average coach. .But,
.“What’s in a name.” Would this
team by any other name ﬁll Pitt
stadium. A look at their leading
performers might decide this.

The Fighting Irish are no longer
ﬁrst in thecountry since they met
the end of their 13-game unde-
feated streak at the hands of their
old nemesis, Purdue. This 27-14
loss to Rookie Coach Terry Bren-
nan’s eleven has taken some of the
gloss off of Notre Dame’s shining
reputation.

Brennan,_ Irish break-away
runner of not so long ago,

‘ blamed the upset on his team’s
complacency. Pitt scout Ernie
Heﬂerle blamed it on their pass
defense or lack of it. He es-
pecially ponted out a weak point
in halfback Joe Heap who has
already been mentioned as an
All-American candidate.

On offense, though, the statistics
back up Heap’s All-American rat-
ing. In three years of varsity com-
petition he has gained over 2000
yards and last year averaged ﬁve
yards per carry. .

He has led the Notre Damers in
pass receiving and punt returns
for thepast two. years. '«.The 180
pound left—halfback returned one
punt last year for a 93-yard-touch-
‘down. Heap also scored ﬁve times
on passes as he snared 22 aerials
for 336 yards.

On the throwing end of these
passes is another three—year let-
terman, cover boy Ralph Gugliel-
mi (pronounced goo-yell-me).
Former Irish Coach Frank Leahy
praised the 20-year old 180-pound
quarterback as “a youngster well
on his waytoward becoming the
ﬁnest signal caller in Notre Dame
history.”

His passes have gained 1913
yards for Leahy teams in the
past three seasons and the year
1953 saw him complete 52 of

.. 11,3 passes. Eight of his tosses
were good for touchdowns while
he" carried the ball over six
times himself. '

of football talent. '

Leading the parade will be a
couple of would-be.All-Americans
-—- quarterback Ralph Guglielmi
and halfback Joe Heap. Gugliel-
mi, already touted as possibly the
ﬁnest offensive back in the coun-
try, is now building a reputation
as a defensive back.

Coach Heﬁerle, who scouted the
Irish, rates Guglieimi as a ﬁne de-
fensive back and a real threat
to our passers. In the game against
Texas the Irish star intercepted
three Longhorn aerials, An inter-
esting observation made by Hef-
ferle was that Purdue kept all
their passes -away from where
Guglielmi was playing.

Heap, in his fourth year as an
Irishman, carries quite a back-
ground. Last year, as starting left
halfback, Heap averaged ﬁve
yards per carry. He also led the

* team in pass-catching and punt re-
turns for the second straight year.

DAN SHANNON & PAUL MATZ
Irish Co-captain Ends

Guglielmi, according to scout
Hefferle, contrasts Heap in de-
fensive performance. “He has de-
veloped into one of the ﬁnest de-
fensive backs around. He inter-
cepted three passes against Tex-.
as, while Purdue was smart
enough to stay away from him.” .

Pass interceptions are nothing
"new for this young ﬁeld general
as he also led his team in that
department last year. He can’t be
in _two places at once, though,
which still leaves Notre Dame
weak on aerial defense.

-Pass defense may be the liabil-
ity for the boys from South Bend
this season but their front line de-
feiise is probably their strongest
asset. From co—captain Paul Matz
at right end to co-captain Dan
Shannon at left end, the line is
like a rubber band bouncing back
anything that hits it.

The front wall, averaging 205
pounds per man, is not as out-
standing on offense though. Dick
Szymanski,‘ Jack Lee and Sam
Palumbo — center, ’guard and
tackle-—all had defensive ex-
perience in-the days of two pla-
toon football. With the advent
of one platoon teams last year,
however, none of them earned
starting berths. ’

Would this team by any other
name ﬁll Pitt Stadium? The score-
board tomorrow will show the
answer.

On a course that was slow in
some spots but otherwise in good
condition, Coach Olson sent his
charges through the paces in time
trials held Wednesday to deter-
mine the starting squad for the
Titan meet. *

The impressive times of Arnie
Sowell and Jack Schubert who
were clocked in 23:l)3 and 23:18
respectively gave indication that
the Olsonmen are about set to
challenge the 23:00 mark that has
eluded them so far. With an ex-
ceptionally fast track tomorrow,
there are good possibilities that it
will be realized.

, Fair-Weather
Fans Can Leave

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

  

A vote of conﬁdence usually comes in a time of jeopardy.
Athletic Director ‘Tom Hamilton, however, pointed out at
this week’s press luncheon that the Athletic Committee’s re-
cent booster does not mean a crucial moment.

Coach Red Dawson was scheduled to appear but was
pressed for time so Hamilton took the stand for the Panther’s
showing thus far. The Captain did not mince words.

Asked right off the bat whether there was dissentiod
among the football personnel or coaches, Hamilton denied
it and-answered, “Everyone in the Pitt athletic family is a
bit disappointed but we have faith in the team.”

He furthered, this by saying, “We’.ré going to ﬁght this
through the storm and We’ll come out of it. Remember, the
season’s only 2/9 gone.” I '

The Director even went *
out on the limb\a bit by stat-
ing that “no later than Satur-
day afternoon we’1l,show that
we’re a ﬁghting teari1..” Of
course, this doesn’t mean a
win but the Director seemed

conﬁdent that a battle was in
the oﬁing. ‘

Line Coach Ernie Hefferle,
who also attended as he scout-
ed Notre Dame, was the next
speaker. He warned that the '
Irish have the usual strong
team, aided by an exception-
ally able line.

' Since Heﬂferle also had-
been at practice this week, Hamilton
the next query concerned the squad’s morale. The reply
was that fora shellacking that they received the previous
Saturday, the spirit was very good and the team felt that
they‘ would be ready for the Irish.

And, before the ﬁnal dishes were cleared away, the Cap-
taincriticized on the Panther rooters who were deserting.
“Let the fair-weather fans leave, we’re going to show Pitts-

burgh some good -football. There’s still a lot ahead.”

It doesn’t seem likely, though, that the fans are jump-
ing the ship .this ‘week as the Stadium is sold out and the
return of tickets since the season began has been very small
and those ducats have been grabbed-up “fast. .

But, as is usual when Notre Dame is the attraction, most
of the fans are Irish rooters, except if Pitt should take a
lead into the late stages of the game when the fans’ natural
reaction is to pull for the underdog. A

So, from this conclusion, the way for the Blue and Gold
to straighten itself out, both on‘ the ﬁeld and in the stands,
is to beat Notre Dame. Need anymore be said?

Murray Schedules

Sgt. Jim Murray’s riﬂe team be-

off with West Virginia last year.
Although Sgt. Murray is begin-

he has been with the university
since 1951, and isfamiliar with
most of the men on the squad.

In Dick Greene, Jim Cleary,
Tom Klaric, Dave Jacobson, and

year’s varsity squad, and an un-
precedented number of new men,
Sgt. Murray believes he has the

Speed Essence of Freshmen
As Boys Face Heavy Schedule

BY NERNIE MORRIS

Vicious tackling and hard—hitting blocks were the theme
of this week’s work, as the Pitt Freshman football team be-

gan heavy drills in earnest.

The coaching staff decided to take the wraps off the boys,
so that they could begin to size up their charges.

Forty-three candidates took part in the drills, eager to
earn a starting berth for the opening game with Penn State

A
V

on October 23.

Speed Only Average

Coach Steve Petro wasn’t too
optimistic because the squad is
relatively a light one, and speed
must therefore be the essence of
such a team. However, the speed
of the Panthers is only average,
and the coaching staff realizes they
face a difficult task if they are to
duplicate last year’s unbeaten
record. v

Jim Theodore, rated as one of
the better backs, has been" unable
to do heavy work because of a

out ’ three weeks, but should be
ready for the opener. The ﬂashy
ex-Wilmerding High back is keep-
ing in ,trim by conditioning drills,
but he'wi11 be kept out of all con-
tact work. Also on the injured list
is James “Skeeter” Oliver, out in-
deﬁnitely with a broken ankle.
Oliver came to Pitt with the rep-
utation of being an outstanding
defensive back.
Many Fail to Report

Petro was disappointed in the
fact, that many boys who had ex-
pressed interest in trying out for '
the squad” had failed to report.
He said, “There were a lot of’ big
guys who were supposed to come
out and didn’t.” . . '

Heavy drills will be the order
of the day for next week’s work-
outs and Petro said by then he’d
havea better idea of wnarto ex-
pect from this year’s squad.

Assistant Coach Carl DePasqua,
who has been working out with
the backs, said, “Our backs are of
average speed, but they’re not too
powerful,” He added that the
