“You can’t offer them politics.
You have to offer them social ac-
tivities. This organization will ﬁll
a gap that has been absent from
the campus for a long time. But
you can’t get active members in
politics,” he stated.

The Citcom president revealed
that his organization was made up
mainly of commuting students not
affiliated with any fraternity or
sorority. Its purpose is to provide
social activities for these students.
An executive board of 13‘ members
has all governing authority.

Organized in 1936, Citcom has
grown from a meager representa-
tion to include almost one—third

  

  
 
 

of the Tech students. In their first
year, the effective organization
placed members in all the ten seats
of Student Council.

“The following year everyone
ganged up and from then on they
were not a social organization, but
a political one. They had nothing
to offer their members.” Hall said.

“It is not anti-frat,” he empha-
sized. _“That is a’ very bad repu-
tation on the campus, and if your
organization gets the name for

that, you might as well close your C

books, because we tried it. Now
with our new policy, we are go-
ing ahead full speed.” .
In warning Pitt’s independent
of some of the pitfalls, Hall re-
ported, “I would like to caution
you against making any c1aims.at
all for political ascension. If a man
is good, sponsor him on the basis
of what kind of a person he is.

The best policy is live and let live, -

because you can’t beat the frats.”

Independent spokesman, Chuck
Davis, in stating its aims, said,
“It should not be called indepen-
dent, because right there you get
an idea of anti-fr“at.”

“We want the best in the re-
sponsible positions, whether they
are fraternity or independent. We
are not after sensation ‘rabble-

rousing eﬁects,” he added.

Men e vs. Women

Today ’s Student Congress meeting should
be loaded with ﬁreworks. It marks the‘ ﬁrst
time that the subject of proportional repre-
sentation——men to women———comes up for of-
ﬁcial discussion.

A petition containing more than the 500
signatures required, has been presented to
President George Lynn with the hope that it
will be placed in the hands of the student
body for acceptance or rejection.

The petition asks, in amendment form, that
the membership in Congress be set at ten men
and ﬁve women. In idea, this proportionalizing,
is worthwhile. In a school where a rattle of
nearly‘ four to one exists, some thought to the
adequacy of an evenly divided oCngress should
be made.

We question, however, the use of an arbi-
trary ten-to-ﬁve proportion. Proportional rep-
resentation means “that the number of repre-
sentatives on oCngress should be based on ac-
tual registration ﬁgures. That means a four-to-
one ration should exist today. In ﬁve years that
might simmer down to two-to-one; but -it
hasn’t yet. ’

Student Congress can accept or reject the
petition. The student body may be permitted
to vote on the subject; they may not. Whatever
happens, today’s meeting will be worth see-
mg.

 

C Q
As the Fire Died.

‘One of the quipsters who inhabit the pub-
lications’ corridor suggested Saturday morning
that the News print a story of Friday ’s bonﬁre
rally and, with very blacktype, headline the
account, “We Are Sorry.” '

Restrained by the skepticism that develops

. in any newspaper oﬁice, the News seldom treats

and event with the splash. accorded the bon-
ﬁre rally. 'When‘the ﬁre had died Friday night,
it was apparent that the News had been sold
short and unwittingly passed on its enthusiasm ,
to its readers. V

Thousands turned out ‘forthe rallyand as
many thousands went away convinced that the
committee in charge of the aﬁair had been
elﬁcient only insofar as the members knew how
to strike a match to a pile of kindling.

The toichlight parade was a jubilant af-
fair, the bonﬁre on the Ellsworth ﬁeld’ was

-probably the largest ﬁre in the history of Oak-

land. And the rally was a disappointing se-

A little more foresight on thepart o”f,the'
coinmittee could have made the rally an event
which every student participating‘ would have
remembered always as an outstanding night in
his collegiate career. . .

Albeit . the administration had been
squeamish in restricting — or attempting to‘
restrict—ethe number of torches carried in the
parade and had squelched a group of ralliers
that made an‘ abortive attempt to pick’ up the
tempo of the occasion with a snake dance
around the ﬁre,‘ the blame for the poorly man-
aged climax to the festivities can be laid only
tc the student" committee. Just a few extra
dollars and a few extra hours of planning
would have given the expectant crowd a me-
morable evening. ,

A‘ small stand for “Ike” Icardi and his
cheerleaders and a respectable public address
system that could have reached the far edges
of the crowd meant the dilference between a
rally and the moribund affair that few partici-
pants will have trouble forgetting. Regard-
less of the outcome. of the game the following
day, the rally might have been great.

The News and the student body expected
more -in an aifair sponsored jointly by Student
Congress, . Interfraternity, and Panhellenic
Councils, three of the most respected organi-
zations on campus. The ﬁre, the band, the
cheerleaders, V the speakers, and, most signiﬁ-
cant, the crowd were there. The ﬁre died, the
band played from its assigned position be-
hind the crowd, the cheerleaders ably directed
‘the ﬁrst rows of the encircling crowd, and the
speakers pocketed _their «carefully prepared
pep talks and resigned themselves to watch-
ing the rally. languish. The crowd slowly dis-
persed as small groups wandered oﬁ to ﬁnd
more interesting activity.

To the crowd that dwindled to a few hope-
ful hundreds the News olfers a sincere apolo-
gy for its misguided recommendation.

Thank you, Mr. Editor, for the

afraid to think for themselves and
want to_ let others do the same.

At. least there are a few of us
‘who recognize the importance of
hearing the views of others, even
’though they may present dissent-
ing opinions. Thank God, there

“Most of that money was‘ paid

Back '  
Issue 

A few days ago,, Bill Rosenfeld, president
of the Engineering and Mines Cabinet, ac-
costed me concerning a familiar subject to the
engineer ‘in activities. Bill is what might be
known as an energetic cuss with a multitude‘.
of ideas.

To Bill, Pitt’s engineer is a most unusual
guy. He (the engineer) hollers loud and long
about what the school is doing for him in the
way of activities. He/bemoans the fact that he
is loaded. down with atough, schedule and must
be given his social life on a platter.

That ’s what Bill is lamenting about. Pitt '8
engineers are to. be giventhe social platter
this Friday eveningiat the William-Penn. The
E & M president claims that they aren’t re-
sponding. Out of‘ som-e 2,300 slide rule .sl_ip-_
pers Bill says that only a handful havebought
tickets. for the only engineering’ school social
affair of the term. .

Wailing loudly in a pot of beer,iBill claim-
ed that E & M Cabinet would have a deuce

-of a time making ends meetif the “ turnout is

as poor as sales indicate. Even Dean E. A.
Holbrook, ordinarily _ a thoroughly, reserved
man, is up in the air‘ about theresponse. , ,

_ To ‘Bill’s fast growing knowledge of the
engineer’s response, the members of student

congress can add manysyllables of .woe. One

of the ﬁrst subjects of discussion lastspring,

when Congress ,met,'was what is wrong with the

engineer. The discussion was lengthy’ and thor-
ough. It ended with no hope in ’"'sight and the
quoted statement from many an up-the—hill
lab: “I’d never send any child of mine to‘. Pitt.
There ’s nothing here for him.” -
That’s as far as Student .Congress.go.t with
it, Bill; maybe homeone else. tan help you.
It ’s a remarkable thing_ that the engineers,
along with their complete lack of interest from
the standpoint of action, can ﬁndso _many
things to complain about. Bill ’s Cabinetﬁnds a.

ment. And, still, no concrete results. _ Y ' _

 Clothing

Thousands of Christmas gifts

will be sent to the needy people in
Europe from Pitt students on Dec.
5, through the American Friends
Service Committee.
. The annual campus-wide cloth-
ing drive for Europe is .. on again,
and this year the need is even
greater- Clothing of all kinds,
from. infants wear to adults ap-
parel, will be collected at the Stu-
dent Desk on the ground ﬂoor and
the YWCA ofﬁce until Dec. 5.

The main essentials for warmth
such as shoes, with fairly good
soles, coats, underwear, skirts and
blouses are of prime importance.

‘But anything will do so long as
it is clean.

Greeting cards including the
sender’s name and address can be
attached to the garments, thus as-
suring their safe arrival.

If the student wishes, his cloth-
ing can be sent to a speciﬁed
place’ or person, whenever pos-
sible. Such requests must ﬁrst be
sent to the Friends for consider-
ation.

Ellsworth Sets
Dance Date

Snow is coming in‘ more ways
than one, for,“Snow Ball” is the
theme of the first Ellsworth Cen-
ter dance. b

Footprints in the white stuff will
lead to the Webster Hall hotel on
the night of Dec. " 5 about nine
o’clock,and lead away again after
one.

But they will have shoveled off
the dance floor of the Imperial
Room by nine so don’t bring snow
shoes or skiis, even though it is
informal. They might trip your
girl. _ ,

David Cleland, chairman of the
dance committee, announces that
Jimmy Spitalny and his orches-
tra will play at the “Snow Ball.”
Other members of the committee
are Morton Teig, business man-
ager; and‘ Nicholas Klaich, pub-
licity chairman.

Tickets are priced at $3 and can
be purchased in room 201 at Ells-
worth Center.

Thanksgiving recess ,will be-

Varsity Band
Plans Program
For Finale

A specially arranged perform-
ance will be staged by the Pitt
Varsity band at the Panthers’ ﬁnal
grid-game with the West Virginia
Mountaineers.

The Christmas spirit will be a
marked reminder to the football
fans that old man winter has gain-
ed a strong foothold, and that
Yuletide festivities are not far dis-
tant.

When the 120- piece marching
unit makes its entrance onto the
gridiron, it will be playing the
“Skaters Waltz.” Then the band
will shape into the formation of
a sleigh. No time will be lost as
the marching musicians move into
the form of a candle with a musi-
cal rendition of “Winter Wonder-
land.”

Then en mass, the corpsmen will
sing out “White Christmas,” at
the same time changing the candle
outline into a Christmas bell. After
the routine has been completed,
the band will play "Christmas
Song.” In conclusion the aggre-
gation will reform the band block
to _play the “Alma Mater.”

The West Virginia band will not
be present. , T

Cwens To Print
All-Girl Book

Cwens hit the spotlight again on
campus immediately after Thanks-
giving recess, this time as publish-
ers of the 1947-48 directory for
women students.

An annual project of Cwens,
the student directory this year
will not contain addresses of men
students. Cost of publication and
inability to catalogue all the
10,000 men students in such a
short time have necessitated the
cut. '

Student Petition Demands
“‘ Proportional Representation

(Continued From Page One)

Passed while there were an
equal» number of men and women
in the student body, this law no
longer provides proportional rep-
resentation.

It will be up to Congress to de-

‘ ‘cide at its meeting today when the

s .
r

‘amendment shall be presented to
_the student body for vote.

The amendments, sponsored by
Grover Mccann, chairman of a
constitutional committee, and
passed by Student Congress last
spring, enabled Congress to ﬁx 3
day for a special election on any
amendment which is requested by
over 500 students at any time dur-
ing the school year, but no sooner
than one month after the petition
has been presented to Congress.

Glitanies heavenward, Meccaward,

be. The bartenders at the Gold
Bar gave thanks a week early as
they waded knee-deep in broken
beer bottles Saturday morning.
“Thank God they were too busy
singing to ﬁght,”, they moaned.
Not everyone will be eating
turkey Thursday, and not because
of the high prices either. The Ath-

letic Board and the Alumni have
planned a festive meal of Milli-
gan stew, while James Hagan,
after eyeing his decapitated tur-
key and feeling the spot on his
own neck where the alumni axe
rested not so long ago, will fast
all day.

Mike Milligan himself will prob-
ably be offering up his turkey as
a burnt sacriﬁce in thanks for his
outstanding , kicking offense this
year. The team as a whole should
be paying homage to the drunks
in the stands who relieved Sat-
urday’s second half boredom with
a display of ﬁsticuﬁs, and to the
hopped-up State fans who pro-
vided the best battle of the day
with the goalpost fight after the

University ofﬁcials, looking back
a little, will turn out en masse to
bow in the direction of Lehigh U.

Veterans Cautioned

On Training Changes

Student veterans who drop out of schools and colleges before
completing their course were cautioned today by the Veterans Ad-

ministration that they will have

quirements to get a VA certiﬁcate to re-enter training under the

G—I bill.-

VA oﬂicials explained that veterans must have a supplemental

certiﬁcate of eligibility when they

to comply with more strict re-

change from one school or train-

Am

ing establishment to another. '

A veteran who, of his own vo-
lition, interrupts his training at a
time other than at the end of a
term, semester or training period,
will not be issued such a certiﬁcate
until he establishes satisfactory
evidence that:

His interruption resulted from
good cause, i.e., illness, economic
conditions, or other circumstances
beyond his control.

The institution or establishment
in which he was training is will-
ing to readmit him as a student
or trainee.

Transmission

.Brings Clarity

By Peg Evans

Like a jigsaw puzzle just begun,
one section of KDKA’s new FM
(frequency modulation) broad-
casting tower is together and each
day it comes a few feet nearer its
designed height of 500 feet.

This tow-er,‘ approximately the
height of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing, will stand on less than one
acre of land on upper campus near
the Mines Building. It rises be-
tween the oldest cemetery within
the city limits and Pitt’s freshman
football practice ﬁeld.

FM or frequency modulation is
a new pattern of radio wave trans-
mission. By using special transmit-
ters and receiving sets, waves are
sent out through the ether in a
very high frequency band. FM
soun-d waves are changed to elec-
trical impulses and reproduced ex-
a‘ctly like the original sound waves.
FM is supposed to eliminate tone
distortion.

The tower will have a safety

a factor of 200% due to the small

area of ground on which it is be-

ing built. Each of the four legs
of the tower sets on a concrete
base much like the leg of a table
sets in a caster cup.

On each of the four concrete
blocks is a unique insulator. There

'are only four insulators of this

kind in the world.

The insulators were mad-e by
Westinghouse after 30 unsuccess-
ful attempts tovbuild an insulator
just the right size whose strength
would increase with the amount
of compres.sion. iWere the 190,000
poun-ds weight on each insulator
removed, each would crack so as
to be useless.

FM is line—of—sight transmission.
The tower will serve anyone liv-
ing within a forty mile radius (as

KDKA is not the ﬁrst station to
use FM; several towers of local
stations are still in the blueprint
stage, but. WWSW has had FM
programs for the past year.
KDKA’s work was delayed, said
Mr. Mitchell, head of construction
for the »station, because steel was
not available. V

The world’s largest FM trans-
mitter stands in the small but un-
crowded office a few feet away
from the tower. _ Q“

The transmitter, made by West-
inghouse and painted pale blue,
has a multitude of intricate noise-

through the colored glass window
of the cabinet like machine.

KDKA’s 10,000 piece tower is
well on its way to competion. With
reasonably warm weather, a
Christmas deadline on construction
is not impossible.

  C&G Chorus

ine

‘-‘Balle1’inas” of the Cap and Grown show this year will
be taught to pirouette by an old hand at the game.

Miss Shirley Eckel, Cap and Gown’s new dance director,
was a featured dancer with the Ballot theatre of New York
for seven years. She made appearances at the Metropolitan Ope-
ra, at the Broadway Theatre, the 44111 Street Theatre, and at

1

the City Center in New York.

During her association with the?

Ballet Theatre Miss Eckel toured
six months each year. She appear-

ed in Mexico, London, Cuba and
in the famous Hollywood Bowl.

Miss Eckel currently is.attend-
ing Pitt and is studying play pro-
duction and theatre art. She was
born in Pittsburgh and is an alum-
na of Carrick High School.

She‘ isn’t discouraged with the
results from her good-intentioned
but hearty “girls” in her dance
group. Rather she says, “The boys
are working very hard and every-
one connected with the show has
given me excellent co—operati_on.”

On Dec. 3 at Foster Memorial
the Cap and Gown will unveil
their 28 beautiful “girl” chorus in
“Mabel’s, Fable,” their production
for the year.

This years show was written by
Pitt students Will Hansen and
Ken Phifer. -The story concerns a
touring USO show that returns to
Hollywood to make a movie about
themselves.

John Geary and Tito Braunstein
have the male and female leads.
John portrays “Gary,” the good-
looking, successful, singer-actor.
Tito is playing the female lead of
“Sherry,” the fast talking, man
crazy, thrush.

Competition for parts in the 1947
production was so keen that Har-
vey Pope says that ‘ this year’s
show should. be better than the
pre-war productions because of

all the excellent material he had
to choose from for his cast.

Previousmembers of the Cap
and Gown show have gone on to
bigger and better things in show
business. Some of them are: Gene
Kelly, Regis Toomey, matinee idol
of the early thirties; and Dr. Ben-
jamin Levant, brother of famous
Oscar Levant.

Stray Greeks
All-Inclusive

The .Stray Greeks association
has been recently organized to in-
clude all fraternity men who do
not have their chapter represent-
ed here. ‘It takes in all transfer
men who are members of a Greek
letter society. Their purpose in
uniting is to be free to partici-
pate in any and all school activi-
ties. -

Last Friday the SAE’s played
host to stray Greeksat open house
and early in December they will
be invited to attend a party open
only to Greeks.

The Stray Greeks will be repre-
sented in IF Councilby their pres-
ident, Tom Ryan, but they will
have no vote. The other ofﬁcers
include Gorden Ossting, vice pres-
ident; and Mike Kadar, secretary-
treasurer. They meet each Mon-
day in Room 204 C1. from 7:45 to
10 p. m. .

Y Membership, Drive
Passes Halfway Mark

YMCA’s membership drive already has procured 225 of the 400
new members expected to join by Jan. 1.

Under the new requirement

of $1 for membership fee, these

new members plus rejoining old members have furnished the Y with
$373 of its proposed $400 called for by the budget.

J. Frederick Miller, executive secretary of the Pitt YMCA, ex-
pressed conﬁd-ence that the goal for new members and funds will

be topped by the end of Decem-¢

ber.

Membership in the Y now re-
quires, besides a $1 fee, a one
hour membership training session.
For the slight fee involved the Y
offers a social membership in the
national Y, which includes social
activities and gym facilities at
all YMCAS.

One of the things sponsored by
the Y which has aroused a great
deal of interest, is the Breakfast
Club. For the next four weeks,
the Breakfast Club will hear
speakers on the Marshall Plan.

Some of the other activities
Pitt’s‘ Y provides for members
are the following: Men’s club, Pre-
Med forum, Monday lunch, and
Wednesday Chapel service.

George Hoffrnon,   No Houdini,
Physic Demonstration/gs  

         

 

George Hoffman, the department of Physics exhibit and apparatus man, 1S shown with some of

his demonstration tools. Hoffman is preparing to throw the switch and obtain readings on a demonstra-

tion model ﬁux meter.

A
“Many students think I’m anoth- V

er Harry Houdini and that G6 Cl.
is my room full of magic tricks.”
So says’ Mr. George Hoffman,
demonstration technician for the
physics department.

~Mr. Hoffman is responsible for
setting up, and in other cases
devising, lecture demonstrations
for the classes in general physics,
and with his “room full of tricks”
can duplicate many of the basic
phenomena in the physical world.
Some of these phenomena include
illustration of such basic physical
laws as the Archmedes principle

or the demonstration of the mod— _

ern Zeleny electroscope. One of
the demonstrations which he ha.s
set up actually appears to repro-
duce a heartbeat.

The equipment which Mr. Hoff-
man handles ranks high with the
instruments used by other physics
departments in the state. Among
the treasures in the ground ﬂoor
cubbyhole is a Geiger Ion—counter,
with which Mr. Hoffman has fre-
quently recovered lost radium in
response to appeals from local hos-
pitals. The entire store of equip-
ment owned by the University has
been estimated at $30,000.

As a student at Penn Sta-te Mr.
Hoffman originally studied poul-
try husbandry and small fruit
farming. Later he worked in the
Inter-Departmental Contract ad-
ministration at Westinghouse. In

 

 

1932 he came to Pitt to do some
special photographic work, and in
1936 he was assigned to the phy-
sics demonstration work in which
he is still engaged. He has also
set up some of the demonstrations
at the Buhl Planetarium.

Setting up demonstrations for
ten classes a day keeps Mr. Hoff-
man busy, but he still ﬁnds time

Mountaineers
Here In Finale

Way back in 1928, an overly-happy West Virginia fan
was hauled into a downtown police court on a charge of dis-
turbing the peace. His plea, “It isn’t very often that we beat

Pitt, your honor. ”.

That was the last year a West Virginia team carried home
a victory. Seventeen times since that 9-6 decision, a Mountaineer
eleven has batted its icollectiveuhead against an apparent sttone

Frosh Boast
Speedy Guard

Two budding guards promise to
spell regulars next fall when the
Panthers bounce through another
rough schedule. Although not
giants these two freshman line-
men more than make-up for size
with speed and agility.

Winning acclaim as an all-State
guard, Bill Pierce stands ﬁve feet,
nine inches and spreads his 175
pounds into a solid rock. The 19-
year old lineman from Jeannette
“shows plenty of ﬁght and abil-
ity,” explains Coach Charles Hart-
wig. l
Over on the other side of the
line, another small guy has been

‘ going wild. Charles Yost weighs

10 pounds more than Pierce, but
is the same height.

Not spectacular: at the outset of
the drills, Yost developed fast and
rates at the top of the list of
freshmen guards. Charley hails
from Youngstown, Ohio. “Yost is
one of the surprise packages,”
beams Hartwig.

Another Donora product prom-
ises .to strengthen the weak
Panther. This time the steel city
produced‘ an end, Nick DeRosa.
Young Nick, only 17, hopes to es-
tablish a Cecconi-to-DeRosa pass-
ing combination come next fall.

After that it was all Pitt.

This year was to be the one
in which the Morgantowners were
to be on their way. They looked
fine on paper and the pre-season

after winning four games against
district schools, they took on Penn
State. The Lions bumped them 21-
14.

They apologized for that one and
turned to Maryland. The Terrapins
were * riding high themselves, so
they trampled the Snakes, 27-0.
Kentucky rolled over them, 15-6.
They came back strong against
Virginia but bowed, 6-0.

The game Saturday, will mark
the season’s closer for both teams.

Aside from Barkouskie, the
Panthers furnished little, in the
way of a defense. On occasion, the
three Bills —— McPeak, Hardisty,
and Bruno—-came through with
thumping tackles. But on the
whole Pitt was non-resistant.

."1‘oe’ Runs, Passes ‘

Hardisty, who in the past has
done nothing but punt, revealed
himself as a runner, passer, and
bruising tackler.

After the game the Panthers
were quick to praise Penn State
as a powerful ball club, but, nev-
ertheless, expressed doubt that the
Staters could fare so well against
Western Conference opposition.

Nothing, however,’ could damp-
en the jubilation of Bob Higgins
who had achieved his ﬁrst unde-
feated and untied season in 28
years of coaching. “It’s wonder-
.ful,” beamed the ruddy—faced Hig
as he stalked about the State

The room itself was a politic-

Johnny Nolan, State’s big
guard, shook the waterboy’s hand
and then, without letting go, de-
cided to pitch the little guy into

Advice for Higgins

Coach Higgins said that prior
to the Pitt game the whole town
of State College, Pa., was on
edge. “Everyone in the village
was giving me advice on how to
play the game,” he laughed.

Higgins indicated that the Lions
would play no post-season bowl
games. “Most of the bowls,” he
said, “are in the South where
they don’t allow colored players.
We wouldn’t think of playing
without our colored boys.”

He said that Penn State was
“not interested” in any of the
minor bowls situated in the North.

School balk
Fails to Halt ‘

Interest in the sponsorship of a
varsity ice hockey team by the
university continues to spread
despite apparent abandonment of
the idea, by school authorities.

The reason advanced by athletic
oﬂicials for lack of a varsity
squad is the absence of adequate
facilities. ,

The project was first broached
by a’ number of enthusiasts from
the Ellsworth Center, and the
movement has acquired mo-
mentum as the news spread over
the rest of the campus.

Pitt has not sponsored a hockey
team since the late 30's, when the
Panthers competed in the Penn-
Ohio College loop with Duquesne,
Carnegie Tech, Case, Fenn, Bald-
win-Walla-ce, John Carroll, and
‘Western Reserve. The latter five
are Cleveland’ schools. 1

John Mcsorley coached the
Panther pucksters at that time.
Games were played in the Gar-

particularly torrid.

Practice was diﬁlcult, with the
Panther icemen rising as early as
4:30 a. m. for practice at Silver
Lake (near Westinghouse High in
Homewood), McKees Rocks, or
wherever any practice facilities
were available. '

Rumors have Duquesne ‘inter-
ested in intercollegiate hockey
again, but plans to reorganize the
Penn-Ohio League apparently
have fallen through due to the
lack of adequate rinks.

Interested parties may leave
their names with Ellsworth Cen-
ter Director of Activities Fred ‘W.
Lange, Room 201 at the Center,
who emphasizes that this is not an
Ellsworth Center project.

Cagers Stage
lnilal Game

Flashing an aggressive and
ﬁghting spirit, the Pitt cagers
staged their first practice game
at the Stadium gym against a
group of independent basketball-
ers from Westinghouse.

No score was kept.

Using separate squads each half,
the Panthers were spearheaded by
the accurate long shots of Sammy
David and the sterling teamwork
of second-stringer Ralph For-
quer.

The ﬁrst squad, Dodo Canterna
and Bill Cieply at forwards, Mort
Lerner at center and David and
Ed Latagliata ‘at the guards, dis-
played mid-season form often dur-
ing the game.

A noticeable feat accomplished
by the Pittites, which may mean

accurate foul shooting. They con-
verted ninety percent of the free
throws.

Inepf Pitt, 29-O

By Donald Giﬂin
Penn State came to town Saturday intent on closing out an
unbeaten and untied season and they did it-without too much in-

terference from Pitt’s Panthers.

Nittany Coach Bob Higgins rode out of the Stadium on Lion root-
er’s shoulders after his boys had rolled over the lifeless Pitt Pan-

thers, 29-0.

It was Higgins’ first perfect season and Penn State’s ﬁrst since

1912, when eight¢
straight.

- Never really in the struggle,
the Panthers were knocked apart
by the rugged State line, who
ﬁnished with the top defensive
record in the country.

State scattered its scoring over
all four quarters. They scored at
6:02 in the opening period, Bob-
by Williams going over from the
one-yard line. The tally capped
a ten—play drive from the State
45.

Williams crossed the goal line
again in the second quarter, this
time from ﬁve yards out, on a
short drive following Pitt’s Bill
Hardisty’s only poor kick that
went out of bounds on the Pan-

th ey ~ won

ther 29.

The Lions drove 78 yards for
another touchdown in the third
stanza, Francis Rogel powering
most of the way. Breaking through
at the Pitt 40, Rogel went ten
yards, then lateraled to Elwood
Petchell, who raced for the six-
pointer.

Reserve End Dennie Haggard
picked a loose ball off Half-
back Bobby Lee's chest and lop-
ped 29 yards for the ﬁnal Lion
touchdown.

Strictly anticlimatic was Ed
Czekaj’s 14-yard ﬁeld goal in
the waning minutes" of the game.

Pitt’s heart had been broken
long before that.

‘Tragedy That 70,000 Must
Watch 22' Says Gongloff

Charlie Gongloﬂ, Pitt's first na-
tional collegiate track champion,
certainly hasn’t let“ the sport of
his conquests monopolize his
thinking.

The 36 year old former javelin
thrower has more thana layman's
knowledge of practically every
major American sport.

Serving unofficially as assist-

Gonglotf is at the Statdium every
afternoon. ,
Occasionally-he raises his eyes

Stadium and remarks, “The trag-
edy of athletics isthat 70,000 per-
sons must watch 22 play, while
22 should be watching 70,000
play.”

But as long as the 70,000 are
going to do the watching, they
may as well enjoy it. So Charlie
has his own ideas on this. ’'

“Many schools,” he said, “are
playing tackle‘ football today with
six men on a team. In such games
the spectators see more than just
a jumbled mass of bodies.

“They get a clear view of what
every player is doing. Then, too,
the game calls for more speed and
skill than does eleven—man foot-
ball.”

Charlie is no stranger to foot-
ball either. He was a sub center

Bowl team.

Gongloff was a boxer, too, al-
though not by choice. The boxing
coach used to ambush Charlie and
drag him to the gym where he
made aim out on the gloves.

Once Charlie outboxed an in-
tercollegiate champ for two rounds
and then, like a small-time Billy
Conn, waltzed in and was tagged
bye-bye. ~

Soccer is another of his sports.

During the war, Gongloff coach-
ed the championship soccer team
on the 15th Air Force in Italy.
Soccer packs the fans in by the
thousands in Italy, but the Am-
erican players are the best, ac-
cording to Charlie.

“T~hey’re rough and have a ter-
riﬁed :ompetitive spirit,” he said.

“The Italians kick the ball deli-
cately and then pose momentarily
in self—admiration of their shot.”

At present, Gongioff is a gym
instructor at Trees Gym. Few, if
any, of his many students know
that at Berkely, California, in
1935 Charlie threw the javelin 221
feet for a new national record.

Although the ‘record was brok-
en the very next year by Alton
Terry of Hardin-Simmons, the
fact remains that Gongloff was
the first link in a chain of na-
tional champions at Pitt.

Charlie's students, however,
know him only as the guy who
can. outlast any member of the
class in calisthenics, and as the
leading basketball cherry-picker
of Trees Gym.

The_United States is rapidly losing her position as a center for in-

Pittsburgh college students were found to expect the inﬂuence
of churches to decline, because of the failure -of religion to meet
today’s urgent needs, according to a poll conducted by the Jeffer-

Pittsburgh students believe the churches must modify their

churches will therefore lose influence in the immediate future. College

Indanthrone wasthe ﬁrst known an-

’-‘nage sales of vat dyes in the U.S. since

its introduction, despite the commer-
cial use of well over 200 types. In 1901,
Bohn ﬁrst synthesized indanthrone by
KOH fusion of 2-aminoanthraquinone,
but the yields obtained were in the
range of only 25-30 per cent. Because
of the industrial importance of indan-
throne, and the low commercial yields
obtained by the original fusion pro-
cedure, a great deal of research time
has been spent in its study.

Several U.S. patents record the fact
that Du Pont organic chemists have
made outstanding contributions in this

bromo-2-aminoanthraquinone and re-
placing the bromine by chlorination to
give 3:3’-dichloroindanthrone (“Pon-

This ﬁxes the chlorine in the desired
positions to give a product with greater
bleach-fastness than indanthrone and
minimizes extraneous substitution that
always accompanies direct chlorination
of indanthrone. The commercial yields
of 3:3’-dichloroindanthrone now being
obtained by Du Pont are markedly
greater than those obtained by Bohn
and his workers. ‘ ‘

It is just as important, however, that
