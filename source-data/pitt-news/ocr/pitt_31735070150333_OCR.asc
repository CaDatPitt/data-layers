  Voter ID
law sent to
lower court

Michael Ringling
Assistant News Editor

The Supreme Court of Pennsyl-
vania ordered a lower court to
determine whether Pennsylvania
voters will have to present photo
identiﬁcation in order to vote in
the upcoming election.

The Supreme Court of Pennsyl-
Vania ordered the Commonwealth
Court to ﬁle a supplemental opin-

ion on the voter ID law — which 1

requires all voters to present a
photo identiﬁcation card at poll-
ing locations — to that of the Su-
preme 'Court’s by Oct. 2, roughly
one month before the presidential
election.

The decision calls for the Com-
monwealth Court to enter a pre-
liminary injunction if it is “not
still convinced in its predictive
judgement that there will be no
voter disenfranchisement arising
out of the commonwealth’s imple-
mentation of a voter identiﬁcation
requirement for purposes of the
upcoming election ...”

One of the major contentions
the American Civil Liberties Union
of Pennsylvania and other groups
presented in a lawsuitwas that the
law disenfranchises voters, and, in
the statement,the court addressed
this issue.

“While there is a debate over
the number of affected voters, giv-
en the substantial overlap between
voter rolls and PennDOT’s existing
ID driver/cardholder database, it is
readily-understood that a minor-
ity of the population is affected by

Doyle takes aim at Romney at meeting with Pitt Dems

Pat McAteer
Senior Stqff Wrz'ter

Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Allegheny,
said Republican presidential
nominee Mitt Romney’s budget
will “put you back to a day in
America you don’t remember”
during a meeting with about 30
members of Pitt College Demo-
crats. _
Doyle, whose legislative dis-
trict encompasses Pitt’s campus,
said on Tuesday evening at the
William Pitt Union that budget

cuts proposed in Republican vice- 

presidential nominee Paul Ryan’s

House budget cut taxes on the ’

wealthiest members of society at
the expense of Medicare recipi-
ents in the future. ‘
“People under 55 are going
to be put on a plan, if Paul Ryan
and Mitt Romney havertheir way,
where they will pick up the ex-
tra cost in Medicare when they
turn 65,” Doyle said. “Right
now, there’s a guarantee where
the government guarantees that
they’ll pick up 80 percent of the

' cost.”

Expanding his critique, Doyle
said Romney’s boast of having
a “revenue-neutral” budget was

misleading, since savings dis-

proportionately stemmed from
elimination of ‘tax deductions
from working- and middle—class
Americans.

“The loopholes to make [Rom-
ney’s budget] revenue neutral are
going to be things the middle
class get: mortgage interest de-
ductions, state .,and local taxes
and charitable contributions.

These are all deductions of the
middle class — they phase out af-
ter $200,000,” Doyle said.

But, Doyle said, Pennsylva-
nia citizens are “starting to get”
Romney’s plans for the middle

4 class — especially after the Dem-

ocratic National Convention in
Charlotte, N.C., two weeks ago.
He added that prior to the con-
vention, he felt the presidential
race between Romney and Presi-
dent Barack Obama was “50 to
50.”

ELECTION 2012

Super PACs withdraw ads from Pennsylvania

Pat McAteer
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Although national polls point to-
ward anlexceptionally close 2012
presidential race, super political
action committees in Pennsyl-
vania silenced their televised
advertisements after statewide
polling indicated a widening lead

8 for President Barack Obama.

On Aug. 28, Americans for
Pros/perity, a super PAC sup-
porting Republican presiden-
tial nominee Mitt Romney,
announced the removal of adver-
tisements funded by the group
from Pennsylvania airwaves. Pri-
orities USA Action, their Demo-

Emphasizing the importance
of local Congressional elections,
Doyle said members of Pitt Col-
lege Democrats need to assist lo-
cal Democrats such as Rep. Mark
Critz, D-Cambria, whose dis-
trict includes part of Allegheny
County. Critz’s congressional race
against Keith Rothfus is consid-
ered one of the most competitive
House races in the nation.

“A lot races that a lot of people
don’t think we can win today,
we’re gonna end up winning,”
Doyle said. “I saw it when I came
in 1994. They said Democrats
were going to lose 25 or 30 seats.
We lost 5o—some seats.”

Doyle attributed the Demo-
crat’s newfound conﬁdence to a
lack of enthusiasm over Romney
as well as a number of recent
speech blunders. He speciﬁcally
focused on a video that went viral
Tuesday, in which Romney said
he couldn’t convince the 47 per-
cent of voters who will vote for
Obama to “take responsibility for
their lives.”

Doyle also said a victory for
Obama could prompt congres-
sional Republicans to work on a
compromise regarding the fed-
eral budget. He added that House
Speaker John Boehner of Ohio

publicans who demand steep cuts

And while less than two

Professor G. TerryMadonna,
director of the Center for Politics
and Public Affairs at Franklin 8:

Pa., said that unlike other “bat-
tleground states,” where either
candidate holds around a 2 to

Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Allegheny, spoke with the Pitt College Democrats Tuesday night aboutwhat budget

Romney in Pennsylvania.

But he also said that state
Republican leaders won’t pub-
licly concede Pennsylvania to
Obama because of other crucial
elections for the party across
the state.

“You don’t want to send a
message that the state’s out of
play by having your leaders stay
home,” Madonna said.

Madonna also said national .

and international events could
shift Pennsylvania polling num-
bers in Romney’s favor over the
next two months, leading to a
new emphasis on the state.b

cated that Romney’scampaign

But more importantly, he said,
a victory for Obama could temper

in an email that the decision
to withdraw advertisements in
Pennsylvania by Americans for
Prosperity is simply a strategic
maneuver by the group and that
the Keystone State will most cer-
tainly be in play this November.

saying their conﬁdence was put
on display at the Convention.

But”Doyle also said Democrats
both in Pennsylvania and across
the nation needed to “spend the
next 50 days working” for anoth-
er four years of an Obama presi-
dency. '

“Pennsylvania is going to re-
main a blue state —— it hasn’t gone
Republican since the ’80s — and
we’re gonna keep it that way,”
Doyle said.

Students in attendance at the
speech gleaned the importance of
their participation in the upcom-

Lara Sullivan agreed. V

“The most‘ important take-
away from the speech is that this

need to keep knocking on doors

Student Government Board carries on without hospitalized president

Megan Trimble
Stag/ff Wr;'ter

The Student Government Board
was without its leader during
public meeting Tuesday night
as President James Landreneau

spent the time in the hospital‘

recovering from Mononucleosis
and Neutropenia, a white blood
cell deﬁciency. _v

But the Board — responsible
for distributing funds from the
more than $2 million Student
Activities Fund —— continued on
with usual Board and committee
reports under the -direction of
President Pro Tempore Natalie
Rothenberger.

Rothenberger, who apolo-
gized in advance for any -mis-
givings in regards to Robert’s
Rules and meeting procedure,
said she was conﬁdent that any
Board member could run the
meetings and that she assumed
the role under constitutional
rule. Rothenberger received the
second—most number of votes in
last November’s SGB election.

“Basically, [Landreneau’s]
immune system is shot. He could
basically contract any diseases
if he came back at this point,”

she said, explaining that Lan—
dreneau had missed four days of
school due to hospitalization.

Board members discussed
campus polling locations and
storage for the upcoming presi-
dential election, as well as adver-
tisingand allocation options for
campus clubs. '

Board member Halim Genus
said he and Board member Julie
Hallinann met with Kathy Hum-
phrey, vice provost and clean of
students, to discuss the move-
ment of the general election poll-
ing location for those registered
in the Schenley Quad and Litch—
ﬁeld Towers to the William Pitt
Union. Currently, students. vote
in Posvar Hall. But the meeting
didn’t end with positive results.

“It’s starting to look more
and more of something that will
not happen forpthis election cy-
cle,” Genus said. “But it’s some-
thing we are going to continue to
pursue for years to come.” ’

He said that the speed at
which progress on the project
is occurring will not ﬁt into the
current election time frame, but
the Board does not plan to end
discussions for future polling lo-
cation changes.

Board member Alex Murdoch
reminded student organizations

that they can apply for storage
spaces in .the O’Hara .Student
Center and asked all groups to
registerfor them sooner, rather
than later.

Murdoch added that Student
Affairs is working on a uniﬁed
logo for,all.club sports teams
that can be adopted in the near
future, once the design is ap-
proved.

“The Board has had the
chance to lookat some of the de-
signs, and they are pretty cool,
so you can choose to use them if
you would like,” Murdoch said.

Board member Rothenberger
transitioned from her role as,
president pro tempore to deliver
her weekly Board report ad-
dressing the ways that student
groups can advertise on campus.

“We held a low—key advertis-

ing meeting to discuss alterna— _

tive methods of advertising on
campus and will be meeting with
[SGB Advisor] Kenyon Bonner to
discuss the feasibility of these
options,” Rothenberger said.

The next advertising meeting
will be held -Wednesday, Sept.
26, at 8:45 p.m. in room 848 of
the WPU. I

As the meeting shifted to—.

ward the Allocations requests,
Allocations Committee Chair-

man Michael Nites reminded
student group representatives
that a brief course titled Allo-
cations 101, which will inform
groups of the procedure for re-
questing funds, will be held on
Monday, Sept. 24, from 6 to 9:30
p.m. in room 630 of the WPU.

The Board felt President Lan-
dreneau’s absence throughout
the meeting and Board member
Murdoch asked to send positive
thoughts Landreneau’s way upon
his arrival back on campus.

“I believe that it is.James’s
birthday on Friday. So if you see
him, wish him a happy birthday
and good health,” Murdoch said.

Allocations

Strong Women, Strong Girls
requested $1,926.16 for yearly

riculum. The Board denied the
request in full, because the re-
quest included a lot of dispos-
able products that. would go to

they can make the most impact,”

Rankin said. “Pennsylvania is ~

still a strong candidate to be in

the Republican column, and we ’

aren’t conceding anything here.”

For Obama, a victory in Penn-
sylvania, a long-time swing state,
could prove momentous in an

election that’s expected to be his-
torically close. During Obama’s
initial presidential run in 2008,
he won the state by a margin of
54.7 to 44.3 percent over Sen.
John McCain, R-Arizona.

And in spite of a statewide
seasonally adjusted unemploy-

ment rate of 7.9 percent in July,

Madonna said Romney’s cam-
paign has struggled to gain a
foothold in Pennsylvania because
of his campaign style and a lack
of speciﬁcity on policy propos-

als.

But more importantly, he‘
said, Romney hasn’t shaken off
the narrative created by both
Obama’s campaign and liberal
super PACs that he’s “for the one
percent and not the 99 percent.”

“Obama successfully, during
the summer months, duped Rom-
ney with a series of negative ads,
including the super PACs, who
portrayed him as a rich guy who
made his fortune off the middle
class,” Madonna said. I

OPINIONS

 

THE RIVETER

Consider the death penal

Rosie McKinley
Columnist

This election season, we might get
lost in debates and news stories sur-
rounding issues seemingly much
more complex than us as individu-
als. It is easy to feel minuscule when
the issues are framed in the larger

contexts of national economic output A

or consulates in obscure cities. The
Avett Brothers verbalize the feeling in
lyrics by declaring, “your life doesn’t
change by the man that’s elected.”

Terrance “Terry” Williams might
disagree.

Williams, 46, is about to become
the ﬁrst executed Pennsylvanian in
13_ years. Williams wasconvicted and
condemned for brutally murdering
two men in the 1980s. One man, Her-
bert Hamilton, was a sports booster.
The other,Amos Norwood, was a
chemist, a church volunteer and a
husband. Both were established men
in their 50s. '

And both were sexual predators.
Williams said they victimized him.
Chances are, he was not the only
child they abused. When Williams
killed them, he was putting a violent
end to a cycle of abuse.

T Before Williams the murderer,
there was Terry the kid. Like many
Pitt students, he grew up in a Phila-
delphia suburb. AtGermantown high
school, he was a promising student
and quarterback of a championship
football team. He is the example of

a child destroyed by abuse.
Williams’ life was far from

charmed. His story is of the boy .

whose abuse started at the hands,
belts and cables of his mother when
he was just six years old. Later Wil-
liams was abused by a stepfather, a
neighbor and ateacher. He met Nor-
wood at age 13, and the abuse began.
Norwood’s murder would eventually
lead to Williams’ own death sentence.

Times were different‘ in 1986.
Sexual abuse was less publicly dis-
cussed. The jury that sentenced
Williams to death over 20 years ago
never heard the evidence of sexual
abuse. '

As Pennsylvanians, we have been
uncomfortably forced to confront
sexual abuse in our state, our com-
munities and our conscience. The
scandal in State College coupled with
the recent sentencing of the Bishop
of the Philadelphia Archdiocese —
which covers a signiﬁcant partof the
state —— means that we, as a state,
better understand sexual abuse than
we did even just last year. As they ask
for Williams’ clemency, ﬁve jurors
and the wife of one victim exempli-
fy the recent enlightenment about
sexual abuse.

Knowing today that Williams’
victims were monsters themselves,
would we still sentence him to death?
If Penn State’s Mike McQueary had
killed Sandusky instead of walking
out of the locker room silently, would
he, too, face the death penalty?

Gov. Torn Corbett says yes. In

MCT Campus

when Voting

August, he signed off on Williams’
execution. On Oct. 3, a half-century
of no contested executions in our
proud state will come to a contro-
versial end.

I am not arguing the legitimacy of
vigilante justice; Williams should face
some level of justice for two brutal
murders, even though hewasvictim—
ized. I am not asking to abolish the
death penalty. And I am not demand-
ing an overhaul of our judicial and
executive branches.

I do challenge you to care about
elections. In a republic as large as
ours, we must rely on an imperfect
system of representation. Our lead-
ers are therefore not just elected of-
ﬁcials in far—off capitol buildings, but
rather a reﬂection of us as a people.

When Williams dies on Oct. 3, his
blood isn’t just on Corbett’s hands,
it’s on all of ours as Pennsylvanians.

Back to that Avett Brothers song.
It might not seem like your life will
change by the man who is elected,
but as long as we live under the rule
of representatives, we are in part de-
ﬁned by the actions and decisions of
our elected ofﬁcials.

So don’t be a part of the 30 per-
cent of unregistered Americans. Reg-
istering to vote is easy. You can ﬁnd
the forms online or can visit either
of the presidential candidates’ cam-
paign oflices. The deadline is Oct. 9.
It’s an easy date to remember —— it’s
one week after Williams’ execution.

POINT/COUNTERPOINT

Why Mitt Romney is

Nick Stamatakis
Asszstamf Opz'7zz'o72s Editor

President Barack Obama is a very cool guy.
Standing next to Republican presidential nomi-
nee Mitt Romney, he’s the Fresh Prince to Mitt’s
Urkel. Votingforhimseems like the progressive,
21st—century thing to do.

At graduation, however, it’s not important
which president itwould be better to have abeer
with. It’s irnportantto considerwhich president
can make ﬁnding a job easier. Onthis count, you
may want to reconsider your vote.

Romney, for one, promises a presidency

that is stimulus-free. Economists disagree on .

the effects of ﬁscal policy in a fragile economy
(despite howlingfromAmerican economist Paul
Krugman and company, dissidents do exist), but
if you believe that markets better allocate money
than the government, you probably come down
as anti—stimulus.

There are hundreds of anecdotal examples
of this, but the most persuasive example is the
current state of China. The modern model of
invasive capitalism, China saw huge stimulus
spendingin2009, but now teeters on the verge
of calamity, with huge infrastructure projects
and excess capacity funded by debt offering
little likelihood of return.

The tendency of government is to be ‘inef-
ficient. Thus, fewer stimulus programs will, in
the long run, create a more healthy economy

for young graduates. More investments will be A

placed into productive means.

Furthermore, re-election ofObama ensures
Congress will remain deadlocked, meaning im-
portant reforms of Medicare and other national
programs will remain incomplete. Things that
could spur real job growth —— reform of the
anti-innovation patent system or the FDA, for
just two examples — will lay dormant.‘

This is, partially because of very aggressive
tactics by Republicans, but also because the
president’s leadership style doesn’t lend itself
to strong actions. After speaking eloquently on
bipartisanship, he leaves the actual negotiations

to congressional leaders, remaining discon-
nected from day-to-day Washington.

So while the president has said he reaches
out, he actually creates-unnecessary tension.
Veteran Washington reporter Bob Woodward
points to Obama’s inability to turn “personal
relationships with congressional leaders into
action” as a“gap” inhis leadership. When across
the table, confrontation with opposing view-
points leads to a tendency to go into “look, I
won here, I’m in charge” mode, not into the
conciliatory negotiator his rhetoric suggests.

If anything is to be done for long-term
problems such as debt, medium—term prob-
lerns such as the patent system or short—term
problems such as opening more lands for oil
drilling (which admittedly has light job—creat1'on
potential), the president needs to be somebody
capable of sitting across a table and talking to
somebody who may be his mortal enemy ideo-
logically.

Romney is probably not the ideal person
for this job. Clinton or Reagan would be better.
Butwithahistory ofworkinginbusiness andas
governor of Massachusetts, signs point to him
being at least better than Obama. And to get
the ball rolling slightly in the way of simplifying
the tax structure and redirecting federal agen-
cies without destructive stirnulus, a Romney
administration offers more hope than Obama.
Okwaisie’s rebuttal

China’s economy grew at 7.8 percent for
the ﬁrst half of 2012. If that is a “calamity,” I

V yearn to see your description of Britain’s post-

austerity 2012 rate of —o.4percent. Also, private
investments fail just as much as government
in_vestments do. AOL bought Time Warner for
$162 billion in 2000, and 10 years later, the
deal cost shareholders billions of dollars. There
are many similar examples, but government
gets more bad publicity as “inefficient” for its
failed investments because the money they lose
is everyone’s money. President Obama is the
pragmatic centristAmerica needs in these times,
and a deadlocked Congress can be prevented by
simply votingoutuncompromising Republicans.

    Why Barack Obama is    
better for the job market better for the job market

Daniel Okwaisie
Columnist

New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman
put itbestwhen he remarked that goingback to
Abraham Lincoln, America “actually had afor-
mula for success.” In the past two decades, this
formula has been steadily abandoned, and thus,
the country has “gone off the rails.” Consider-
ing theeconoinic woes the U.S. ismuddling

through now, it is difﬁcult to disagree with him. ,

The good news is that the formula still exists.

However, in the ever-confounded world of

economic policy, that formula must be ground-
ed in perspective and ﬁne-tuned accordingly.
President Barack Obama is best suited for the
job market because, given the context in which
American economic policy today has to be ad-
ministered, his plan for America incorporates
that formula.

It might seem strange that despite wide-
spread remonstration about high unemploy-
ment, newspapers, billboards and job sites
continue to ﬁll their job advertising sections
from week to week with various j ob openings.
Why don’t people get these jobs (many of which
are well-paying, too)? The biggest reason for

this is that globalization has systematically’

eliminated j obs that involve repetition, gradu-

ally leaving behind jobs which many of the

unemployed don’t have the skills to do. Higher
unemployment is thus steadily becoming less
of a cyclical phenomenon (as a result of reces-
sions) and more structural, in the sense that
even in good economic shape, higher unem-
ployment might persist. _ A

If these repetitive and relatively low—skilled
jobs are not coming back like Stevejobs once
retorted, the solution here is to make it possible
for people to attain better skills toparticipate in
the new global economy. And sincethe under-
privileged happen to be the ones most plagued
by this structural predicament, this is the time
for the government to invest in higher educa-
tion, not cut it.

-There is no reason why the United States

should be engaged in a race to the bottom with
developing countries. Developing countries
target lower taxation rates to compensate for
the inadequacy in infrastructure, and busi-
nesses who usually move to such places often
ﬁnd they have to incur some costs for that.

' Yet the heart of the Republican plan is to cut

spending and investments in infrastructure
in order to give tax cuts to corporations who
won’t build many of such inffastructures on
their own, but rather will leave when there
is none. On the margins, tax cuts and credits
may induce some businesses tocome back,
but a sustainable economy can’t be based on
constant cutting. — .

The formula of success that Friedman was
referring to is the recognition that private en-
terprise thrives best when public investments
in people and infrastructure are strong. Because
businesses won’tbuild roads butwillleave when
there are few, they don’t always give their em-
'ployees resources to pursue higher training.
They will prefer to leave when the workforce
is inept or too costly. Taxes are an expense they
love to hate. In this global economy, America
should, not be reduced to the battle of who can
offer you the lowest tax rate for the lowest infra-

structure. President Obama understands this. , .

Stamatakis’ Rebuttal

You point out that Obama supports more

investment in higher education and infra-
structure, and that this would improve the
job market; I agree that better higher educa-
tion and infrastructure are important. But the
government is not equipped to handle these
decisions; California recently approved a-$68
billion high—speed passenger-rail system. Sexy
infrastructure, but unlikely to be completed,
and with fewer beneﬁts than less—sexy freight-
rail projects. And in higher education, more
ﬁinding won’tﬁx problems. More innovative
delivery systems like the Khan Academy and
Sebastian Thrun’s artiﬁcial intelligence class
will power the ﬁiture. More of the same will
just lock the United States into a 20th-century

-spending program.

 Men’s soccer continues unbeaten run over Weekend

j ‘Pant/yer: dcjféat two more nonconfermcefaes as Big East P14)! czpprorzc/765

Donnie Tasser
Stqff Wrz'ter

. The Pitt men’s soccer team en-

joyed another perfect weekend
— thanks largely to the efforts of
two freshmen.

First-year starter Nick Wysong

paced the Panthers in their.two _

games, recording a hat trick in Fri-
day’s win over Northern Kentucky
and an assist against Duquesne
on Sunday. His performance won
him Big East Rookie of the Week
honors. Fellow freshman Matt Ve-
nanzi scored the game-winning
goal against Duquesne Sunday.
The Panthers (5-0-2) have won
their last four games and are off
to the program’s best start since
1986, when they started 7-0.
Despite the early success, head
coachjoe Luxbacher doesn’t think

the Panthers have hit their stride ‘

yet. _
“We still are playing a little bit
a inconsistent. At times we’re play-
ing really well, but there are times
where our level drops off. While we
are getting better, we’re still not
where we need to be, or where we
will be [for Big East play] ,”_he said.

Pitt 3, Northern Kentucky 2

 Like they have done for most of
the season, Pitt fell behind early ,

but rallied late to beat the’ North-
ern Kentucky Norse Friday night.
Four of the undefeated team’s
seven results have come after trail-
ing late,.displaying these Panthers’
penchant for drama. .
“We’ve been in similar situa-
tions all year, so when we went
down two goals, we knew that it

‘was still possible for us to win. At

the same time, we knew we needed
to play better soccer,” junior Ryan
McKenzie said.

Northern Kentucky, led by

» freshman Nick Toney, would score

twice in the ﬁrst 55 minutes. i
The ﬁrst goal occurred when
Toney curled a shot from eight
yards out that Pittsophomore
goalie Lee Johnston couldn’t ge
a piece of. -
The second goal occurred in
similar fashion. Toney received
a perfect lead pass from fellow

freshman Kevin Walker, dribbledp

past a charging Johnston and
found the back of the net,- giving
NKU a 2-0 lead. I

But true to form, Pitt would
comeback in a big way, led by

. birthday boy Wysong.

Wysong received three monster

\

gifts in the form of a hat trick.“This
was about the team tonight,”
Wysong said. “Every single one
of my goals was off a major con-

‘ tribution from one member of the

team-.”
Wysong’s ﬁrst tally of the night
came off a rebound. After he shot

on frame, Wysong received a pass '

from junior striker Nico Wrobel
and buried the second chance for
his ﬁrst goal of the night, also his
ﬁrst of the season. ‘

After breaking the shutout, Pitt
kept pressing for more, with the
closest opportunity coming when
Wysong sent a bending ball off the
crossbar. A _

Two minutes later, Wysong
would level the score, thanks in

Even with an extra 20 minutes,

the Pitt women’s soccer team ~45;

couldn’t muster a goal. Even
worse, they were only able
to register one shot — and it
wasn’.t even on net. Lucky for
them, South Florida had similar
trouble scoring,’ and the Pan-
thers were able to escape from

Tampa with a 0-0 tie.

Head coach Greg Miller la-
mented his team’s continued
attacking struggles.

“We didn’t have any offen-

sive threat today,” Miller said-‘~,

in a press release. “It was just
one of those days. Once again,
we didn’t do a very goodjob of

_maintaining possession. In over-

time, we challenged our team
to play more forward to try to
manufacture a goal, trying to
get a set piece or corner kick,
and we had some oppo_rtunities.”

Senior forward Ashley Cuba
credited the defense fortbuckling _
down when the team couldn’t
generate anything at the other
end ofthe ﬁeld.

“We just weren’t creating
offensive opportunities,” Cuba
said. “It was a bad day. But the
defense played absolutely awe-

some. And I have to give big...

props to Nicole [D’Agostino];
she played a great game.”

Pitt’s (5—5—1) first tie of the
season was a lucky outcome.
The Bulls (4-3-1) controlled the
tempo for most of the double-
overtime marathon, blasting 21‘
shots —— six of which were on net
— and notching seven corner
kicks to the Panther’s zero. The
tie leaves Pitt winless after two
Big East games (0-1-1), during -

which it has been outshot 55-7 

overall and 19-3 on goal.

TASSER’S TAKE

Replacement referees failing
r miserably at their obs  

   
   

Donnie Tasser
Stcyj” Writer.

Roger Goodell, stop being uncompro-
mising and give in already. Pay the real
NFL referees the paltry thousands more
they’re asking from your billion—dollar
league so that everyone will shut up al-
ready. When the top football stories on
Tuesday mornings deal with what the of-
ﬁcials did on Sunday and Monday instead
ofwhat the players did, it’s time to cave.
Give the zebras what they want.

A According to ajune 5 article on Espn.
com, the NFL Referees Association never
planned a strike but balked when the NFL
offered them a lower pay raise than it did
in the last collective bargaining agree-
ment in 2006. To make matters worse,
they were incensed to hear that the NFL
planned to discontinue the referees’ pen-
sion plan, which had been in place since
1974- '

Mike Arnold, counsel for the NFLRA,
was quoted in the artlcle as saying the
NFL declined a proposition to “grand—
father” away the pension plan, which
essentially limited it to current referees
before discontinuing it.

'“The league’s proposal is a massive ..

takeaway in the overall economic pack-
age at play in the negotiations,” Arnold
said in the article. “Now, despite record

revenues, the NFL wants to do away with _

Hreferes ven’t. looked like they know what ty’r doing. MCT Campus

That bit of information makes the NF

the [pension] plan.”

look even more like the badguy in this
situation. The replacement refs — mostly
Division II and III ofﬁcials —— are almost
comically Voutmatched in their new prime-
time roles.

The replacement referees seem down-
right intimidated by the players, which
causes them to lose control of games (see
last weekend’s Ravens-Eagles game) and
unable to ‘handle the larger rule book of
the NFL. They especially had trouble on
the NFL’s biggest regular-season stage:
Monday Night Football. In the game be—.
tween the Denver Broncos and Atlanta
Falcons, the replacements were almost
obnoxiously slow to get calls, double and
triple checking with their fellow refs,
which _contributed_ to a one-hour-long
first quarter.

Players throughout the ‘league -
Washington’s DeAngelo Hall, Cleveland’s
Scott Fujita and just about every player
on the Ravens, just to name a few — have
made their criticisms of the replacements
known to the media via interviews and
tweets. Hall even went as far as jokingly
saying they should start a locker room
fund to help thereal ofﬁcials get back
on the ﬁeld.

While missed calls are expected, things
such as the phantom pass interference
calls seen this week (Ike Taylor in the
Stee1ers—Jets game and Torrey Smith in
the Eagles—Ravens game, for example)
stand out. LeSean McCoy went on a Phil—
adelphia radio station and said one of
the replacement referees told him, “He
needed [McCoy] on his fantasy football
team.” That’s’ridiculous. They already
suspended one replacement referee who
was to ofﬁciate the New Orleans—Carolina
game because it was discovered he made
his die—hard Saints allegiance ———'as well as

his game assignment, a league violation
— known on his Facebook page.

Every time the replacement officials
turn the field of play into a circus, an»
other fan will curse Roger Goodell. How
much control the commissioner has over
the league’s negotiation tactics, I don’t
know. But if he gave himself the power to
suspend players based on circumstantial
evidence (see Jonathan Vilma), he can

‘give himself the power to pay the right-

ful ofﬁcials. 
Seriously, do this before a player gets
hurt or a wrong call directly affects a big
game. Or worse, the referees negatively
affect the stats of the players on my fan-
tasy team. I ‘f

skewed, however, due to her back line-’s
ability to pressure the opponent to take
low percentage and off—target shots.
“The back line does a great job dis—
rupting [opponents’] rhythm and forcing
them to take far and bad—angle’ shots,
which is obviously a lot better than allow-
ing through balls and closer shots,” Cuba
said. “The. far shots also helpus offen-
sively, making the transition smoother.”
USF ﬁred eight ‘shots in the first half,
10 in the second and another three in the
overtime periods. Lauren Yobbi’s header
sailed wide in the ﬁrst overtime period

for Pitt’s only shot of the day. D’Agostino, '

a sophomore goalie, saved all siic. shots

“We found a way to get alpoint today,”

Miller said; “We gutted it out. Our back '

line and goalkeeper kept us in the game.
Credit USF, they played more physical,
read the game better and intercepted
passes. USF deserved to win the game.
We were fortunate to get a tie.”
D’Agostino agreed. ‘

“The defense played well in front of

me,” she said.’ “We didn’t play our best,
but I’m glad we got out of there with a
tie. Hopefully we can get two [wins] this
weekend.” .

weekend, when they-travel to the midwest

Following the equalizer, play went back
and forth for the rest of the ﬁrst half and
most of the second half before Pitt took
control.

In the 70th minute, Venanzi was fouled
about 30 yards from goal, earning a free
kick. Venanzi then stepped up and drove the
ball into the left corner of the net, cleanly
beating Duquesne goalie Sam Frymier.

“It’s a great feeling to be able to get my
ﬁrst career goal [of a free kick] and help
the team get a win,” Venanzi said.

But the Dukes didn’t quit, creating sev-
eral opportunities to tie the game again.

In the 86th minute, freshman goalie Dan
Lynd, who had to take over for the injured
Johnston‘, was beaten by Duquesne striker‘
Josh Patterson, but the fonWard’s shot rock-
eted off the post and out of play.
