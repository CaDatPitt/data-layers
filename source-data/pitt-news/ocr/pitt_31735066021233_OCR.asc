Owner says ‘Banana’
not a fascist hangout

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

Johnny Zarra,~owner of‘ the

Electric Banana nightclub, denied
charges that the club has become
a hangout for fascist skinheads in
an interview Tuesday night.
A The charges were made by
Howard L. Ross, regional direc-
tor of the Anti—Defamation
League of B’nai B’rith, while lec-
turing area campus police about
hate crimes at a seminar on
March 31.

Ross said he got his information
from the Pittsburgh police. Offi-
cials from the Zone 5 station
house and the Youth Squad said
they had heard nothing about fas-
cist skinheads at the nightclub.

”[Ross has] never even been at
the Banana,” Zarra said. ”The

_ police know nothing about this.

As far as I'm concerned, Howard
Rossis a troublemaker who can't
find an honest job.”

Zarra pointed out that there are
a lot of skinheads in Pittsburgh,
but the vast majority of them are
not racists. Zarra said that non-
fascist skinheads do come to the
-Electric Banana.

”There can't be any more than
10 fascist skinheads in the entire
city,” he added. ”Most skins in
Pittsburgh are good kids. But I
can see why Mr. Ross is fascinat-
ed by the racists. He’d be on un-
employment without them.”

Jeff Lamm, a member of the lo-
cal punk band Half Life, also said

that the club is not a hangout for
white supremacists. Half Life fre-
quently performs at the Electric
Banana.

”There are a few racist skin-
heads out there,” ‘Lamm said,
”but they don't come up here.
Just because someone shaves
[their] head doesn't mean they're
a racist.

”I was a skinhead for six years,
and I was never into that Nazi
crap,” he added.

Four years ago, someone put a
”white power” ad about Half Life
in Flipside, a fan magazine. Half
Life has fought to stop rumors that
they are a fascist band.

”When the ad first ran, we had
problems with people trying to
join our ’movement,’” Lamm
said. ”When they found out there
wasn't any movement, they
stopped coming to-our shows,
and I think that's great.

”We won't tolerate Nazis at
our shows. They know they're
not welcome, especially at the
Banana,” he added.

Lamm said that though there
have been problems with fascist
skinheads in other cities, there
have never been any ‘major
problems in Pittsburgh.

1 ”Every so often, I will get a call
from a racist asking our band to
join their movement,” Lamm
said. ”Unfortunately, there will
always be a few nuts trying to

‘start something up. I justargue

with them and then hang up.”

Pitt alumnus receives
bicentennial medallion

By Kathleen Brown
For The Pitt News

Virgil Fassio was presented
with a bicentennial medallion
from the University of Pittsburgh
Tuesday night as he addressed an
assembly on ”The American
Newspaper: ‘Its Present and
Future.” . '

Fassio, upon receiving the

‘bmedallion given only to distin-
guished. alumni, said he ”never '

expected it”and that getting the
award was ”one of the proudest
moments of my life.”

Fassio, a 1949 Pitt honor gradu-
ate, is presently the publisher of
the Seattle Post—InteIIigencer. He
has held this position for over 10
years.

While at Pitt, Fassio founded
the Beechview News, a bi-
weekly paper, in addition to be-

ing a letter-earning catcher on the L

varsity baseball team.

Fassio, a Pittsburgh native, said
he ”never dreamed of being a
newsman.” He planned to enter
politics after graduation.

He said that he doesn't regret
his decision because the media is
an ”exciting business” and he is
especially fond of newspapers
because ”a newspaper touches
people's lives.”V ~

Fassio has had many honors in-
cluding ”Man of the Year” in
1964 from the international Cir-
culation Managers Association
for his national work with the
news carrier programs.

By serving on the advisory
board of the Seattle Mariners
American League Baseball team,
Fassio has kept his hand in the
baseball world as well.

‘Cool It’ project seeksto educate

‘By Brendan Kevenides

Senior Staff Writer

The National Wildlife Federa-

tion has begun a yearlong project 9

to pull college campuses around
the nation together in an effort to
halt global warming.

The ”Cool |t" project is
designed to expand existing cam-
pus environment concern groups
into one nationwide environmen-
tal network.

”Cool .It will tie- campuses
together and develop existing
projects further. It will also give
these projects a theme,” said
Nick Keller, NWF national coor-
dinator of the project.

Global warming is suspected to
be occurring as a result of a
breakdown in_ the earth's protec-
tive ozone layer (due to man-
made fluorocarbons) and excess
carbon dioxide levels in the at-
mosphere (due to the burning of

forests and fossil fuels). This al-
lows the sun's rays to enter the at-
mosphere in higher amounts but
does not allow the excess heat
generated to escape. -

The heat created by this green-
house effect could lead to the
destruction of farm land and the
drying of reservoirs.

Because this is a worldwide.

problem, Keller stressed that the
effort to stop this cumulative

MOSCOW (AP) — President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev yesterday
appealed for calm in Soviet Geor-
gia and an end to nationalist
demonstrations that have claimed
at least 19 lives in the southern
republic, the Tass news agency
said.

Also today, the Communist
Party chief of Soviet Georgia
offered to resign after local lead-
ers met to discuss the violence,
the Foreign Ministry said.

The appeal from Gorbachev
and the resignation offer came as
scattered strikes continued in
Georgia and funerals were
readied for the people who were
killed during the suppression of
the protests Sunday.

In an address to the Georgian
people, which Tass said was pub-
lished in the republic’s capital,
Gorbachev said pro-inde-
pendence
”damaged the interests of peres—
troika, democratization and
renewal in the country.”

Gorbachev said, ”The interests
of the working people have noth-
ing in common with attempts to
sever the existing ties of friend-
ship and cooperation among our

peoples, dismantle the socialist
system in the republic and push
it into the slough of ethnic
enmity."

NEWS BRIEFS

Gorbachev said ”actions by ir-
responsible persons” had led to
the loss of life in Tbilisi, the
repubIic’s capital, and he called
on all inhabitants of Georgia to
show restraint and common
sense.

”Welmay not allow a blow to
be dealt to the interests of any
Soviet republic, to the brother-
hood of the peoples of the
U.S.S.R., to the cause of renew-
al,” Gorbachev said.

Casey's campaigners
to get $10 million

HARRISBURG (AP) ~ Gov.
Robert P. Casey will spend at
least $10 million in a re-election
bid next year, a member of his
campaign staff said Monday.

The disclosure was the clearest

in a recent series of signals that
the Democrat will seek another
four-year term and it came just
about the time of a morning an-
nouncement that Senate Repub-
lican leader Robert C. Jubelirer
would not run for his party's
nomination.

Jubelirer, president pro tem of
the state Senate, was once consi-

dered one of the top prospects for ,

the 1990 gubernatorial race. He
had been backing away from run-
ning in recent weeks. He made
his decision official in a news
conference at Altoona and in a
series of interviews with Capitol
reporters.

The 52-year-old Blair County
lawmaker is the fourth Republi-
can to announce he would not
seek the GOP nomination to run
against Casey. He joins U.S. At-
torney General Richard Thorn-
burgh, U.S. Sen. John Heinz and
former U.S. Transportation Secre-
tary‘ Drew Lewis as non-
candidates. Thornburgh already
held the state's top job for two
terms.

Two shot after dual
bank robberies

(AP) — A city policeman and a
bystander were shot Wednesday
in a gun fight between police and
a man suspected of robbing two
Downtown banks.

The police officer was rushed
to Mercy Hospital and underwent
surgery for a bullet wound in the
abdomen, said police Com-
mander Ronald Freeman. The
bystander was hospitalized for a
leg wound.

The suspect fled in a taxi and ‘A

was caught across town, he said.

The suspect was also injured,
but the extent of his injuries were
not immediately clear. The iden-
titles of the people involved were
also not immediately available.

Two different Downtown

. banks were robbed around noon

Tuesday.

”When the first bank was
robbed [Tuesday], all our people
converged on the area thinking
the same thing would occur to-
day as occurred yesterday, and it
did,” said police Chief Ralph
Pampena.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April 13, 1989

Televangelists’ days are numbered

RADNOR, Pa. (AP) — Aca-
demic experts and TV minis-
ters say the heyday of the
huge, national TV ministries is
ending, partly as a result of re-
cent scandals and also be-
cause of the fragmentation of
television audiences.

TV Guide magazine sur-
veyed more than two dozen
TV ministers, religious broad~
casting executives and aca—
demics to get their views on
the matter. A report on the sur-
vey is being carried in the
April 15 issue.

Since the scandals involving
evangelists Jimmy Swaggert
and Jim and Tammy Bakker,
ratings for television ministries
have declined steeply, the
magazine said. _

According to Christianity
Today magazine, in 19.84 the
top five television ministries
had a combined audience of

more than ‘seven million
households. By late last year,
they had dropped to four mil-
lion households. 1

In addition, contributions
fell dramatically. TV Guide
reported estimates that Swag-
gert’s ministry dropped from a
$120-million-a—year enterprise
to $60 million a year almost
overnight.

While Pat Robertson was
away campaigning for presi-
dent, his Christian Broadcast-
ing Network reportedly lost
some 38 percent of its
revenue, TV Guide said, and
Jerry Falwell blamed the scan-
dals for the loss of $7 million
in donations.

Most observers believe con-
tributions to TV ministries
overall are still down signifi-
cantly, but there have been
signs they are picking up.
Robertson's CBN is staging a

comeback, and Falwell and
”Hour of Power” evangelist
Robert Schuller say their
ministries are stronger than
even

But doubts remain in the re-
ligious community that the
scandals that hit TV ministries
are over, TV Guide said. The
most likely source of trouble is
the InternaliRevenue Service,
which is examining 23 TV
ministries amd has looked at
16 more in the past.

The investigations range
from allegations that ministers
are. siphoning off donations for
personal enrichment to the al-
leged use of ministry money to
finance political activities.

Some evangelists feel the
IRS probes are nothing more
than fishing expeditions and
complain about harrassment.

Banana

Continued from page 1

Zarra said that the Electric
Banana is a ”rock ’n’ roll club,
not just a punk club. We have all
types of bands here, though they
must be original bands. As long
as they aren't cover bands, we
will book them.”

Rob Tabachka, a member of lo-
cal thrash metal band Eviction,
said that he has never had any
trouble with racists at the Electric
Banana.

”We play with all types of
bands up here,” Tabachka said.
”That includes hardcore bands,
and we have never run into that
type of problem up here. I've
been coming here for five years,
and I've never seen it.”

Zarra said he felt that the club
may have gotten a ”bad rap” be-
cause of racist graffiti on North
Oakland buildings near the club.

”That was probably some jerk
who never even came to the

,__j__

SPACE?

club,” he said. ”The Banana is
the closest club, so we got the
blame.”

Zarra has owned the club for
19 years. At one point in the late
1970s, the club was a disco with
a large black clientele.

”This is not, and has never
been, a racist club,” Zarra said.
”We have never booked a racist’
band. In fact, there are no racist
bands in Pittsburgh. _

”I don't think that [Ross] had
any business mentioning my
name, and the Electric Banana is
my name, and I intend to keep it
clean. It’s a nice place."

City sues over train derailment

(AP) ~ The city of Pittsburgh
has sued Conrail and Monsanto
Co. to recover costs incurred fol-
lowing a train derailment and
subsequent chemical spill that
forced the evacuation of more
than 10,000 residents two years
ago.

The suit, filed Friday in U.S.
District Court, follows a similar
move by Allegheny County.

The city said it spent about
$225,000 for police and fire pro-
tection, evacuation of the city's
Bloomfield neighborhood and
cleanup of the spill, according to
city solicitor Dan Pellegrini. Al-
legheny County spent about
$25,000, he said.

The derailment occurred April

11, 1987, when one Conrail
freight train left the tracks along
a curve and knocked a second
freight train, carrying phos-
phorous oxychloride, off parallel
tracks.

The chemical is a gasoline ad-
ditive produced by Monsanto
that can react chemically with
moisture in a person's lungs to
produce hydrochloric acid. -

The heavily populated Bloom-
field neighborhood was evacuat-
ed twice, on April 11 and April
12, and 70 people were hospital-
ized for treatment of skin, eye
and lung irritation.

Randy Struk, attorney for Mon-
santo, said a study performed in

March 1988 by the Center for 1

Hazardous Materials Research in
Pittsburgh showed that any
potential health or environmen-
tal effects were created by the
burning of phonograph records
contained in one of the train cars.
He said the records released
hydrogen chloride gas. _

"We'd like to reiterate that the
spill did not leave any adverse
health or environmental effects in
the Bloomfield community,”
Struk said. .

Struk said the spill of phos-
phorous oxychloride was ”con—
fined to a small area and was
largely neutralized in place by
natural processes.”

Conrail spokeswoman Kathy
Meehan declined to comment.

of scrutiny,” Robertson said.
”You don’t condemn a group
of guilt by association.”
Plenty of new faces are
ready to fill any void left by the

downfall of Swaggert and the

' Among them: Kenneth Cope-

Charles Stanley of the First
Baptist Church of Atlanta; D.

James Kennedy of Fort Lauder-
dale, Fla., and Frederick Price
of Los Angeles.

But none of the aspirants is
likely to rise to the promi-
nence once enjoyed by TV
ministers,‘ said TV Guide,
which saw the growth of the
religious broadcasting au-
dience leveling off.

’’I think what we're seeing
in religious broadcasting is
analogous to the decline of the

big three television networks,”
said Martin Marty, a religious
scholar at the University of
Chicago.

”When Oral" Roberts first
came on, there were only
three channels, and he was
one of them. That was huge.
Today, when you have 40
channels, no one’s going to
rise that high.”

Can a 'fairness' law
really be a fair law?

The House Energy and Commerce Committee has
drafted and approved a bill which would require
broadcasters to give opposing viewpoints on con-
troversial issues on the air. This means that if a pro-
gram or an editorial is aired that addresses a hot topic
— such as abortion, the latest presidential elections,
Bush's Cabinet appointments, anything that could be
considered "controversial" —— the station must air an
opposing viewpoint on the subject. I

There are two major problems with this idea. The
first problem is that it is an unconstitutional infringe-
ment on the First Amendment rights of the broad-
caster. Broadcasters are being told that they must give
a certain opinion, and that is unacceptable. This line
of thinking could be extended to other free expres-
sions of opinion. Newspapers, magazines, books,
even rallies and public speakers would be threatened
by the precedent. Any regulation of one form of free
speech is potentially expandable to other forms.

The second problem is the difficulty of determin-
ing what an opposing opinion is. If a station editori-
ally endorses a Republican candidate in a
controversial election, would it be required to give
air time to Democrats? What about independents? So-
cialists?,Communists? Could this be expanded to in-
clude the Populist Party or the American Nazi Party?

It's just a bad idea. The precedent it sets is fright-
ening and unlikely to pass the Supreme Court, if the
bill is actually passed by both houses of Congress.
Enforcement will be difficult until extremely specif-
ic definitions of "opposing views” are drafted.

We as Americans have the right to express any
opinions that we want to. We have no, obligation to
supply air time or print space for an opinion that we
do not hold.

What do you do with a used

This letter is in response to Matt
Martin's "Perspective on Abor-
tion” [Part I, April 10] in which

' he argues that abortion should be
illegal because there are so ‘many
couples who, unable to have
children of their own, want to
adopt.

It is hard to imagine how Mar-
tin could miss the flaw in his ar-
gument when he himself quotes
"there are 100 infertile couples
for every healthy, white infant.”
Yes, Matt, that's right, these cou-

Matt didn't bothei to mention is
that there are plenty (in fact, an
abundance) of unwanted infants
these couples could adopt. The

wrong color.

Members of the "pro-life" or
"anti-choice" (the now-preferred
term since these people do not
concern themselves with the
"lives" of women or-children al-
ready born, only fetuses) pressure
all women, especially uneducat-
ed, poor, black women, to carry
their unwanted babies to term
and then give t-hem up for adop-
tion. But the anti-choice people
do not help these women once
their babies are born, and none
of the white "full of love" cou-
ples want their black infants.

While the anti-choice people
support legislation that would
force all women to bear unwant-
ed babies, they are against legis-
lation  that would make sex

 

Ever since President Reagan
moved out and President Bush
came in, the game of musical
chairs has continued. Reagan ap-
pointees are now working the
other side of the street, represent-
ing private clients seeking as-
sistance.

The most popular profession
for ex-administration appointees
seems to be public relations.
"Public relations” has a nice ring
to it and, like ”consultant," you
can make it mean anything you
want it to. b

It's interesting to note that these
people, who are now charged
with buttering up the media,
were not too friendly to us when
they were doing Reagan's

"Why should I talk to you, San-
ford?" I asked._"When you were
in the White House, you never
returned my calls."

Stanford replied, "It wasn't my
fault. How did I know that I'd be
representing the hot cross bun in-
dustry when I left the
government?"

"That's not a good enough ex-

(who, by the way, were only a
small portion of the 600,000 at-
tending the march in Washing-
ton) as those "who are trying to

In fact, it is believed. that most.

pro-choicevactivists and NOW ,

abortion. All women know that
abortion is one of the most
difficult and painful decisions that
aiwoman would ever have to
make, and hope never to have to
make that decision. It is not an
"easy" choice, as Matt repeated-
ly writes.

The fact is, abortions will al-
ways exist. The question is, will
they be legal" and safe proce-
dures, or will we go back to the
days of women dying in back al-

question is not whether abortion
is right or wrong, but whose de-

Toilet seat caprices

A man was arrested" on two
counts of harassment yesterday.

Vernon Jacobs, a Pitt sopho-
more was apprehended in the
Cathedral of Learning yesterday
afternoon at approximately 12:37
for harassing women. Vernon is
also the main suspect in harass-
ment cases that have happened in
other buildings such as the Wil-
liam Pitt Union.

Vernon's psychiatrist explained
the nature of Vernon's crimes in
a confidential interview. He stat-
ed, ”After Vernon was dumped
by his girlfriend last fall, he decid-
ed to take revenge on the whole
female sex. Every day, for the past
seven months, hehas been going
into the ladies’ rooms and lifting

all of the toilet seats. It made him V

feel better.”

Vernon was caught red—handed
lifting the seats in the ladies’
room on the ninth floor of the
Cathedral of Learning by under-
cover detectives posing as Pitt ad-
visers.

While being arrested Steve
said, ”If I made just one woman
fall in, then I'm happy.”

A reliable source has told this

columnist that Councilwoman ,_

Michelle Madoff had recently
been the victim of harassment

downtown when she ”fell in” in
the ladies’ room at the City-
County Building. This source has
also stated that Ms. Madoff has
called for the head of the culprit,
and is now in charge of a three-
part investigation to uncover how
Vernon was able to do this
dastardly deed for so long.

Director of Public Safety Glenn
Cannon would just like to see the
investigation dropped. He sug-
gested ”banning this guy from all
ladies’ restrooms.” Cannon
would like to head his own inves-
tigation that would hopefully rev-
eal why women ”just don't look
before they leap in the first
place.”

Dealing with an unfaithful lover

Dear Ghengis,

I am a 79-year-old Pitt student
majoring in communications.
”I\/Iuffy” and I have been in the
same sorority for two years, and
we were best friends from the
time we met at freshman orien-
tation. Last week, I found Muffy
in bed with my fiance, ”Skippy.”
I have been deeply hurt and

.don’t know what to do. I can't

break my engagement with Skip-
py because he’ll take his credit
card back. And I just couldn't
even stand to look at Muffy at the
mixer last night. Do you think we
should all go for some sort of
counseling? Or perhaps Daddy
will let me get away from it all
in the Bahamas. Oh Genghis, I'm
so confused!

Deeply Wounded Buffy

Dear Buffy,

The solution to your problem
is so simple and elegant that
when ltell it to you, I am sure that
you will -chuckle indulgently to
yourself and say, ”Why didn't I
think of that?”

The first thing that you will
need is a spear. If you don't have

The protection of SDI is a must

In a recent Pittsburgh Press Per-
spective article, a Carnegie Mel-
lon professor was mentioned
who opposed’ military» research
for the Pentagon being conduct-
ed at CMU. His position was ex-
pressed with a quote from the late
Presidentlohn F. Kennedy: ”Man
must put an end to war, or war
will put an end to man.” Yes, that
idea would present a comfortable
situation, but let's not fool our-
selves. The professor's opposition
to ”Star Wars” research is based
on an unrealistic idea of peace.

PAUL G.  
KENGOR

The difference between the
professor's idea of peace and
former President Ronald Reagan's
is drastic. The professor's peace
is one in which there are no
weapons or wars, whereas Rea-
gan’s is ”peace through
strength.” But given the un-
predictable insanity of some Mid-
dle Eastern countries’ leaders,
and the always—needed skeptic’s
eyeon the Soviet Union and
Cuba, Reagan's theory is by far
the more feasible. Consider the
fact that Soviet sources claim Is-
rael, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Iran and
Egypt are currently developing or
already possess medium-range
missiles.

Sure, it would be nice if we
could tell the rest of the world
that we'll quit producing
weapons and destroy those cur-
rently in use if they do the same

with theirs, but there is n9,v1a)L_..

they would comply. We could
also guarantee to these countries
that we'll never wage war with
them if they don't ”aim ’em up”
at us — this also will never hap-
pen. There would always be the
fear that either side" would not
comply. What do these irrecon-

 

country’s need for a solid protec-
tive defense system. Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative would
provide this-form of security.
The argument from the left is
that SDI doesn't work. The oppo-
sition contends (from sources
usually other than the actual
manufacturers themselves) that in
reality it would only be (depend-
ing on the source) 70 percent to
90 percent effective. ‘Which
means, for example, that in the

event of a nuclear war, we would ,

only save seven or nine out of ev-
ery 10 of our cities. Consequent-
ly, I guess the opposition would
like for us to scrap the proposal.
Bad idea. Then none ofour cities
would be protected. I’ll~be eter-
nally baffled as to why they
woulddismiss the proposal on
these ”imperfect” premises.
Let's not forget the ultimate
flaw in liberal theories, this being
their failure to recall |_essons
learned through history. Time has
given us a perfect example of
how the United States, as we've
come to know it, has been.
preserved by our superiority in
arms. From the Gatling gun, to
the tank, to the atom bomb, to the
H-bomb. Should we have discon-
tinued research on these
weapons when they weren't per-
fected from Day One? These
have all preserved the American
way of life since the Constitution
was written. However, the most
ironic thing is that these were all
offensive weapons used to kill
and destroy in order to protect
our country. SDI would protect
our country by defense —- not fir-
ing a single shot against another
nation. Hence, it's astounding
that liberals would oppose it.
Americansldie in war. With
Reagan's SDI, fewer of our
citizens would die. Pacifists
should love this.
Are the Soviets still a concern?
Of course. -It would appea‘r_.that
Mikhail Gorbachev might be a

peaceful reformer, but let's not
forget that he's leading a country
that has held strongly onto com-

munist rulefor t,Ij_,e";r,r‘1ajority ofthe  .:
20th‘ century. He could always ‘

be, for a number of reasons,
replaced by a war-hungry, party-
line communist leader.

With SDI, other countries’
weapons would be rendered ob-
solete, due to the fact that they
couldn't effectively damage us-
through our defensive screen.
Thus, SDI would prove an awe-
some deterrent. '

There's already been a circum-
stance where .SDl would have
been extremely useful: In the

1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, Presi-

dent _Kennedy was confronted
with possibly the most difficult
problem in U.S. history. He had
to prevent the possible end of
U.S. civilization, as we knew it,
via a missile attack from the
Soviet Union and Cuba. Kenne-
dy’s options were few, but lucki-
ly, we escapedidisaster. lthink
that if JFK were alive today, he
would applaud the SDI proposal.
For, in 1962, if he would've had
an SDI, the country would have
been safer had it ever come to
nuclear-confIict.

SDI will take time to perfect.
Something of this magnitude has
never worked to perfection at its
first proposal. Just imagine Gen.
Robert E. Lee's reaction if a time
traveler had said to him, ”You
know the country of Japan? Some
day we're goingto travel across

. the sky, like birds, in these man-

made objects called airplanes
and drop a bomb on them that
would destroy all of ‘Grant's
troops combined.” Lee's reaction
probably wouldn’thave differed
much from that of modern SDI
opponents.

Let's hope that if another mis-
sile crisis occurs in‘ the future, that
we'll have an SDI. system
deployed. ' ‘ .

Woody Alien’s

Another Woman

By Dmitri Ragano
Staff Writer

Once again Woody Allen takes
us to the tastefully decorated
world of Manhattan's repressed
bourgeoisie. But don't expect any
comedy this time. This is one of
the great director's ventures into
”seriousness,” a somber portrait
of a woman reaching middle-age.

Gena Rowlands plays Marion,
a brilliant philosophy professor
who has just gone on sabbatical.

pretending that everything is fine
in her life. Through a vent in her
apartment she can hear a psy-
chiatrist holding session. The
confessions of one patient (Mia
Farrow) come as a revelation for
Marion.

Marion begins a long period of
self—discovery, trying to come to
terms with the people in her life:
her smug, deceitful husband (Ian
Holm); her estranged brother
(Harris Yulin) and her idolizing
daughter-in-law (Martha Plimp-

previous marriage which ended
tragically and a man she reject-
ed (Gene Hackman).

Allen has gathered an amazing
cast. The only member of the en-
semble who falls short of excel-
lence is Farrow and it's more the
script’s fault than her own.

Another Woman is a technical
triumph. Stirring music, beautiful
cinematography and Rowland’s
voice—over narrative provide a
very fluid journey through Mari-
on's psyche.

Allen’s script lets the ensemble

 

soar at times, but i thought it was
spotty. Allen has always used
long monologues to convey neu-
rosis. This works well in comedy
but in more serious drama, where
something subtle is required, it
seems overblown. This is the
kind of film with dinner scenes
where a woman goes on a teary-
eyed tirade, revealing a lifetime
of resentment, and her husband
tells her ”i think you've had too
much to drink.”

Another Woman is a character-

study, but an essential element of

dalous. tormented lives while
producing noble and brilliant
work. It would be interesting to
find out why Marion's genius fails
her in real life.

The range of emotions in
Another Woman goes from frigid-
ity to rage, with scarcely anything
in between. I’m no master of psy-
chodrama but I think the movie
might have felt a little more hu-
man if it showed some ot the
warmth and absurdity involved in
relationships. The film reeks of
genteelity and sobriety.

There are moments of real and
delightful sentiment, but on the
whole Another Woman left me
with a lukewarm reaction at best.
The resolution at the end of the
film didn't feel genuine. Allen has
been accused of imitating Ingmar
Bergman. The Bergman films l’ve
seen are more pretentious than
this, and also much more satisfy-

however, Another Woman is the
most tastefully color-coordinated
film Allen has made. The autumn
hued scenery matches the brown
and olive outtits that evervone’s

olive fingernail polish matches
her olive clothes. Now that’s
what I call taste!

Fugazi
Fugazi
Dischord

Ian MacKaye first lent his voice
to the likes of Minor Threat, one
of the East Coast's premier hard-
core bands back in the late '70s
and early '80s. Minor Threat
bludgeoned the way for the
straightedge movement, which
preached abstinence from alco-

hol, drugs and one-night stands.

After two albums, the members
of this D.C. powerhouse parted
ways, and MacKaye shocked his
devoted followers by shedding
his straightedged approach. He
started his own record label, Dis-
chord, which he still manages to-
day, and worked at promoting
and producing other East Coast
bands.

In the mid '80s, Ian released a

 

7" single with a project entitled
Egghunt. It was a big switch from
his earlier, brash, hardcore style.
Egghunt was melodic, feeling and
very together, both musically and
lyrically.

Fugazi is Ian's most recent mu-
sical effort, branching off into yet
another venue of musical explo-
ration. Joe Lally, Guy Picciotto
and Brendan Canty team up with
Ian in the band's self—titled LP

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April 13, 1989

Fugazh

Not to offend any straightedg-
ers, but if this is the kind of mus-
ic that Ian produces while not
practicing straightedge, then he
should spend his time stone
drunk in a bordello. Give the
man a drink because Fugazi is by
far MacKaye’s most honest and
inventive musical adventure to
date.

The whining, nasal—caked vo-

 

cals are still there, but the beast-
ly powerchords and gutteral
screams have given way to smart,
upbeat tunes with complicated
time changes and infectious vo-
cal mixes from Ian and the other
members of Fugazi.

Don't misunderstand, Mac-
Kaye hasn't lost any of his uproar-
ious strength from the Minor
Threat era. He doesn't need to
yell to be powerful; there's just a

spasmodic twinge in his voice
that mixes with the tunes to place
an overload on your sensory ca-
pacity.

From the rockin’ "Waiting
Room” and "Bulldog Front,” to
more subdued, borderline-
acoustic tunes like ”Give Me the
Cure” and ’’Suggestions,’’ Fuga-
zi presents a well—rounded, very
together musical ambiance.

Even Ian's slew of four—|etter ex-
pletives that made moms every-
where despise Minor Threat,
have boiled down to meaningful

words with twice the letters and .

four times the intellectual
potency.

You can't even really catego-
rize Fugazi’s style. Sure, it's down
to earth rock ’n’ roll, but it leaves
any of MacKaye’s previous mu-
sical schemes Iying splattered
along the intricate road that
bands have to travel to break free
from hardcore.

MacKaye and Fugazi haven't
totally severed their roots in hard-
core either. There’s definitely a
raw touch held over that Ian will
probably never lose. How could
he, after reaching such a mile-
stone with Minor Threat? But
Fugazi rises above the hardcore
squalor to a distinctive rock ’n’
roll plane.

Even as impressive as.Fugazi is,
as a band they have still received
very little recognition. As Ian
says, "I'm a patient boy. And I'll
wait and I'll wait and I'll wait."

Back on the Streets

By David Fricke

Rolling Stone Writer

Lou Reed had plenty of good
reasons for calling his new album
New York. This is one of them.

”Okay, this is the first day of
recording,” Reed says. ”We’ve
just laid our second track down.
All of a sudden, there's a Con Edi-
son brownout. The lights flicker.
That's it, son.

”We go outside; the guy at the
newspaper stand at Eighth and
Fifty—seventh says, ’Did you see
that?’ See what? ‘Manhole cover.
The pressure in the sewer system
was so heavy that it blew the
manhole cover 20 feet up in the
air with flames shooting out of
the hole.’ ”

Reed laughs the dry staccato
chuckle that occasionally punc-
tuates his trademark deadpan
voice. ”First day of recording,”
he says. ”What do.| get out of
New York? You must be
kidding.”

Everything Lou Reed gets out of

his native city — the energy and ,

violence, the romance and sor-
row, the art and vices, the gran-
deur and catastrophe, not to
mention the odd column of fire
in the street —- is densely packed
into the barbed-wire verse and
sinewy guitar muscle of New

York.

”It’s essentially about a big
city,” he says of the album,
which he co-produced with Fred
Maher, a former drummer for
Reed and the band Material and
a member of Scritti Politti. ”New
York is the city I know best.”

Yet like the best of Reed's solo
exploits and the whole of his Vel-
vet Underground oeuvre, this
fourteen-song, fifty—eight-minute
dispatch from Concrete Jungle

‘Central also shivers with a topi-

cal and poetic resonance that
transcends geography and sky-
line. The star-crossed tenement
lover, AIDS victims, crack ad-
dicts, child beaters and cop killers
that populate new York may have
local addresses, but the eroding
social and moral conditionsthey
represent are universal in appli-
cation.

”|’ll take Manhattan in a gar-
bage bag,” Reed snarls in
”Romeo Had Juliette.”

Reed, who sang about the ci-
ty's underground and underclass
for nearly twenty—five years
without flinching, is mad as hell,
and on New York he doesn't care
who knows about it.

”We’re in this terrible morass
of people absolutely not giving a
sh—'t about anybody but them-
selves,” he says heatedly, pulling

himself upright in his chair at the
Upper West Side headquarters of
Sister Ray Enterprises, his
management-production compa-
ny. ”And a mean—spirited govern-
ment that is essentially attacking
people that can't defend them-
selves. That’s the weakest people
—- the kids, the sick, the elderly.
And I think we should fight
back/’

It's not like Reed has suddenly
come down with a severe case of
Bono—itis. The Brooklyn—born
avant-rock guru had already ap-
peared at the 1985 Farm Aid con-
cert, sung on Sun City and
co—starred on the first Amnesty In-
ternational tour when he told
Rolling Stone in 1986, ”The days

of me being aloof about certain V

things are over.”
But New York is a remarkable
entry in Reed's rock ’n’ roll can-

Reed

Continued from page 14
on, because it documents his
own burgeoning social obsession
with a cutting twin-guitar clamor
(courtesy of Reed and his current
sidekick, Mike Rathke) that
recalls, and refines with dry, dra-
matic clarity, the tenacious
primitivism of the Velvets in live
overdrive.

”|t’s the sound I've heard in my
head for tvventy-five years,” Reed
says. Then there's the album's
carefully scripted, rapier lyric
thrust, drawing blood, laughs and
tears in dizzying succession as
Reed intones his ”State of Our
Disunion Address.”

Nowhere on the album is that
combination more potent than on
New York’s pulsating coda,
”Dime Store Mystery.” A prayer
for wisdom that doubles as a
hymn to Reed's late friend and
patron Andy Warhol,'the song
summons up apt memories of the
Velvets with its heartbeat drum-
ming, by guest Maureen Tucker,
the group’s original drummer,
and mesmeric John Cale—like
seesaw bowing, by bassist Rob
Wasserman.

sese on Nightline,” Reed says,
”trying to explain to these fun-
damentalists and Ted Koppel his
take on Christ. I was writing
down the things he was saying ~
human nature, godly nature, the
dichotomy. It reminded me of
when I was in college,
philosophy classes — which
came first, the emotion or the
thought, the body or the mind? I
wrote it, and I thought it was
done/’

But it wasn't. ’’I woke up one
morning and said, “This is not
your song yet. It's not your thing,
talking about Christ.’ Suddenly
l’m rewriting, and I find I'm in St.
Patrick's Cathedral where the

service for Warhol was held. .

Now it makes sense to me. then
l wrote one of my great lines —
‘I wish I hadn't thrown away my
time/on so much human and so
much less divine.’

”lt’s something that may run
through all our minds at one
point or another,” he says. ’’I
wish I'd done better. I wish I'd
talked to him before he died. You
should think about that now,
about people you haven't talked
to... Lou. Or you, if you happen

to be listening.”

Any debt Reed still owes to
Warhol will surely be paid in full
when Songs for ’DreIla, the full-
length requiem he is writing with
former VU cohort John Cale,
bows at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music this December.

When Reed and Cale (who are
working on new music together
for the first time since Cale left the
Velvets in 1968) aired the
fourteen—song suite as a work in
progress at St. Ann's Church in
Brooklyn this past January,
”’DreIla was already shot through
with the chamber—crunch tension
and tough-tender realism of their
best work as Velvets.”

It was also a frank, loving look
at a man who befriended and in-
spired them, shocked and trans-
formed the art and pop worlds

and left a few casualties in his"

wake.

”There was some nervousness
initially, about whether —- could
we still do it?” says Reed of the
pair's decision to rejoin forces.
”Could we play together again
and have something good come
of it?”

But Reed and Cale had already

held some get-acquainted jam
sessions after the artist Julian
Schnabel suggested to Cale at
Warhol's wake that he write
something in his memory, thus
setting Songs for ’Drella in mo-
tion (Drella is short for Cinderel-
la, one of Warhol's old
nicknames). Besides, argues
Reed, ”who better than John and
"I to write it?”

And who better than Reed to
write an entreaty and epitaph for
the city he loves and hates in
equal measure? ”The haves and
the have-nots are bleeding in the
bathtub,” he sings in ”Hold On.”
”That’s NewlYork’s future, not
mine.” -.

’’I’m not going to let that be my
future,” says Reed, who instead
has a lengthy tour on tap. ’’If the
town has to go down, it can go
down without me.”

When Bullet Lavolta were
scheduled to play at the Foundry
last November, their van broke
down, so they stayed home. But
they didn't give up.

The hard-rocking Boston band .
is coming to the Sonic Temple
tomorrow, and it's worth the wait
because accompanying them are
their labelmates on Taang!
Records, the indomitable punk-
poppy Lemonheads. Rounding
out the evening are locals Half
Life, soon to be busting out in
full-length vinyl form.

Bullet Lavolta are a bunch of
Harvard boys gone awry. They
exceed all permissible noise lev-
els on their self-titled EP, which
includes such notable anthems as
”Dead Wrong” and ”Over The
Shoulder” (not the Ministry tune, ’

Jourgensen wishes he could rock
as hard). If the straight-ahead,
knock-‘em-over rock ’n’ roll of

' such bands as Government Issue

and Knifedance is your forte, then
Bullet Lavolta is sure to be your
cup of tea.

Complementing the noise at-
tack are the slightly more sedate
Lemonheads. Their fuzz and jan-
gle stretch the definition of punk
rock, yet the sentiment is still
there, and so are traces of
Dinosaur, another Massachusetts
legend.

And the inclusion of the Kiss
classic ”P|aster Caster” imbues
their Creator with extra coolness
points. The Lemonheads are for
those with melodic strains and an
occasional acoustic guitar in their
heads. - .

I something

 

On the set of

By Matthew Myers
Staff Writer

In the world of opulence and
splendor that is Hollywood,
many actors and actresses strive
inexorably for that luxurious mo-
dus vivendi, that cozy little man-
sion in Beverly Hills, that cherry
red Lamborghini with the per-
sonalized California plate, or that
expensive, tailor-made designer
wardrobe.

But actress Sarah Jessica Parker
says she is not and never will be
a member of the Hollywood
elite.

’’It doesn't matter to me if no-
body recognizes me when I walk
down the street,” says Parker, ”or
if I have a million dollars. The im-
portant thing is that my cats are
fed and that I'm fed and every
once in a while I can indulge in
that's probably
hedonistic.”

If Parker, who has just finished
shooting Thomas Carter's Equal
/ustice here in Pittsburgh, seems
like a woman who has traversed
the throes of the entertainment
world, then the identification is
more than accurate. A veteran of
over 15 years in film, television
and theater, Parker has, indeed,

acquired the acumen needed to '
survive in the tempestuous busi-
ness of Hollywood.

”I’ve been doing this for so
long now,” she says. ”I mean, the,
industry is so manipulative. [The
producers] don't have to live with
my choices, but I do. I've been
very fortunate because everything
I've worked on has been critical-
ly successful, regardless of how
well it's done commercially.”

Born in Nelsonville, Ohio, Par-
ker was raised almost from birth
to have an appreciation for the
arts. She is the daughter of a truck
driver and a household engineer,
who were considered ”East Coast
intellectuals. They had very, sort
of, purist attitudes which I admire
a lot. It sort of subconsciously
keeps me in line.'’

Raised in Cincinnati, she began
studying ballet with the Cincinna-
ti Ballet Company when she was
eight years old. That same year,
she landed her first role in an
NBC After-School Special, The
Little Match Girl.

After earning a scholarship with
the ballet company, she met
producer Harold Pinter and, at
the age of 11, went to New York
to star in William Archibald’s ver-
sion of Henrylames’ The Turn of-

Uollusﬁce

rt three: O tolk with Soroh Jessico Porker

the Screw with her brother.

Following several more After-
School Specials for NBC, Parker,
still only 11, traveled to London
where she starred in The Inno-
cents with Claire Bloom. The
show, yet another adaptation of
The Turn of the Screw, toured
New York where it did several
successful runs on Broadway.
Then, after seeing a preview
showing ofA Chorus Line, Parker
realized that acting was to be her
life's occupation.

’’I remember standing outside
the stage door exit, waiting for
Sammy Williams and Priscilla Lo-
pez to come out,” she laughs. ”I
was only 13. At that point, I kept
having delusions that Michael
Bennett was going to walk
through the door and discover
me. It actuallytook me a few
more years.”

She and her family moved to
New York, where she and her
brother began to act in commer-
cials, vOice—Overs and regional
theater groups. Parker joined the
Metropolitan Opera Children's
Choir and eventually landed her
first big role, starring in Annie on
Broadway.

way by myself everyday, only 15

Sarah, neglect is a form of child

really want my mom hanging

After-School Specials and TV

.E'.V.'.n.9

By Vince Carey
Contributing Editor

”What’s your favorite color,
baby?” .

For a lot of people the answer
to that question is the next line in
the song album Vivid: ”Living
Colour.” _

Finally hitting the charts after a
number of years walking the
streets before Epic Records was
willing to take a chance, Living
Colour promise to be around for
a while (they appear this Saturday
night at the Syria Mosque
Ballroom). _

’’In 1986, i joined Living
Colour, and all I can say about
this band is, ‘it's about time!’ This
isn't funk or jazz with a little rock
influence thrown in,” lead singer
Corey Glover said. ”This is rock
’n’ roll with the same roots as any
other modern rock guitar band.
And right now, we're having a
really good time doing this.”

Colour isn't one of your typical
hard rock bands, though. Work-
ing in a genre of music that has
gotten a bad rap the last few years
with the emergence of such
bands as Cinderella, Europe and
Bon Jovi (all of which blow the
big wazoo), Living Colour is hop-
ing to change that.

Theyhave things to say and
hope to get it across to people.

Oh yeah, they are also black.
That fact may not matter to a lot

of listeners, but when the band

was trying to get a start, it mat-

tered a whole lot. The band —— .

guitarist Vernon Ried, bassist
Muzz Skillings, drummer Wil-
liam Calhoun and Clover —
wasn't given a chance by radio
programmers. Even though they
had a.two-song demo tape

produced by none other than

Mick Jagger. »

”People were skeptical,” co-
manager Jim Grant told Rolling
Stone. ” ‘Mick Jagger? So what,’
they said. I’d call some labels and
say that I had two demos Mick
Jagger just produced and not get
caHed back/’

The band eventually did catch‘

on by literally walking the streets
trying to sell the demo. Epic
Records took a chance, and now
that risk is finally startingto pay
off. ‘

Vivid is climbing the charts and
the social messages of the band's
songs are starting to catch on.

One of the strongest songs on
the album is ”Open Letter (to a
landlord_).’’ Principal songwriter
Ried didn't like what he was see-
ing in the neighborhoods around
him, so he decided to send a
message.

”Now you can tear a building
down/But you can't erase a

Color

Previ

SW

memory/These houses may look
all run down/But they have a
value that you can't see...” is the
chorus of the song. The message
is powerful throughout.

Landlords are tearing down
buildings and throwing people
out on the streets. Living Colour
hope that this song can show
how a lot of these people feel
about the situation.

One of the most memorable
songs on the album is ”Cult of

Every once in a while, there is
a political leader who can sway

, people's thoughts in such a way

that anything he says, goes. Liv-

‘Glover's vocals, give us a lasting

impression.

’’I sell the things you need to

belts out Glover.

The song rings true, with
Colour trying to tell people to

guard against it. Mixed within the.

such people as Martin Luther

crowds (albeit in a worthwhile
way) to the effect that their words
were gospel.

The two songs that Jagger
produced, ”Glamour Boys” and
”Which Way to America?” are
social commentaries about the
rich and the way they run their
lives.

The best thing about the album
is that Living Colour didn't fall
into the ”new group syndrome,”
in which every song sounds the
same. They mix a hard rock beat
with some softer stuff to make ev-
ery song a different experience.
There is evidence of Led Zeppe-
lin mixed with some good rap
and Living Colour’s own brand of
rock.

Ried wrote or co-wrote every
song except ”Memories Can't
Wait,” which was written by the
Talking Heads’ David Byrne and
Jerry Harrison.

The band's personal back-
ground is just as diverse as_ the
album.

Ried was born in England to
West Indian parents who moved
to New York some time later.
He got his biggest break as a
guitarist on Jagger's Primitive
Cool album. He is-also a found-
ing member of the Black Rock
Coalition, a group dedicated to
discrediting racial stereotypes in
music.

”My parents were totally into
American music,” Ried said. ’’I

Xavier Cugat to Dionne Warwick
to the Dave Clark 5.”

Glover, characterized by his
long hair painted in different
colors, grew up in Brooklyn and
originally wanted to become an
actor. By the time he reached
high school, he had appeared in
a number of commercials, pub-
lic service ads, musicals and pub-
lic theater. His most prominent
role was as a smart-mouthed
young soldier in Oliver Stone's
Platoon.

Drummer Calhoun grew up in
the Bronx and is a 1986 graduate
of Boston's Berklee School of
Music. He holds a degree in
production and engineering and
was the winner of Berklee’s
”Buddy Rich Award” as an out-

standing percussionist.

Skillings is a native of Queens,
and he played mostly in local
groups around Queens.

”The music is real, it's honest,

' it's us,” Skillings said. ”lt’s about

freedom, about playing what you
feel and believe in. One of my
biggest kicks is watching the au-
dience reaction to the band. I
hope Living Colour will open
some doors and carry that reac-
tion further.”

Ried credits his background for
the making of Living Colour.

’’I always wanted to be a rock
’n’ roll musician,” Ried told Roll-
ing Stone. ’’I grew up thinking
and feeling musicthat way. Rock

’n’ roll has been laguing me all
-3--r

my life. I wouldn't play it if I
didn't have to — it's too much of
a hassle. Rock ’n’ roll picked
me.”

With the way Vivid has hit the
music world, it seems that a lot
of rock ’n’ roll fans are picking
Ried and his mates as well.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April I3, I989

The lost tapes of

By Jeffrey Ressner

Rolling Stone Writer

Mixed vibrations are in the off-
'ing for Beach Boys fans: the
band's 1966 milestone Pet
Sounds should make its often
postponed arrival on compact
disc in the United States by this

g_ summer, but plans for release of
Q the unfinished and long-stored

1967 follow—up, Smile, have
been scrapped.

Although most of the Beach
Boys catalog has yet to be made
available on CD, both the Pet
Sounds CD and the reconstruc-
tion of Smile werelow priorities
for the band during the past year,
as Brain Wilson pursued a new
solo career and ”Kokomo-” be-
came the Beach Boys’ first No.1

5 single in more than two decades.

' Creative conflicts also delayed
Pet Sounds. Wilson wanted to in-
clude previously unreleased
tracks on the CD, but the other
Beach Boys vetoed the idea. Wil-
son, who produced the original
tracks, hoped to close the CD
with an a cappella harmony seg-

Qment, some brief studio banter

and the song ”Hang On to Your
Ego,” which evolved into ’’I
Know There's an Answer” on the
original album.

While the band argued, the en-
hanced master tapes of Pet
Sounds were accidentally
shipped to. Capitol’s affiliate in
Japan, manufactured and were
briefly available before being
Qcalled.

When the CD is released in the
United States, it will be a true
mono mix, like thejapanese CD,
but without the bonus cuts, says.
Time Devine, A&R director at
Capitol Records. Devine adds
that about a dozen other Beach
Boys titles on CD will slowly fol-
low Pet Sounds into the stores.

More uncertain is the fate of

mile, Brian Wilson's could’ve-
been masterpiece, which was

°the Beach Boys

shelved in 1967 when Wilson
began sliding toward nervous
collapse as a result of drug abuse.

Last summer producer Andy
Paley, who has worked with Wil-
son on several projects, and en-
gineer Mark Linnett scoured the
Beach Boys’ vaults and Capitol’s
warehouses to uncover whatever
existed from the Smile sessions.
They found parts of a symphonic
suite about the elements and a
song called ”Do You Like
Worms?” along with familiar
material, such as ”Cabinessence”
and ”Heroes and Villains,”
which eventually showed up on
subsequent albums.

’’I weeded down about 150
tapes,” says Linnett, who ac-
knowledges that ”a lot of the
material was a long way from
completion.” -

”Smile could have added up to
about three albums,” adds Paley.
”There never was any real order
to it, so Brain said he'd like to put
it all on CD and let people pro-
gram their own Smile. Almost

any order we listened to it, it

sounded great.”

Sources close to Wilson say he
would need at least three solid
months to compile and complete
Smile, and it is still possible that
work on the mythic album might
eventually begin again. Wilson,
however, is said to be more in-
terested in working on other
projects, such as a second solo
album.

_ He and his therapist,’ Eugene
Landy, are now writing songs for
an upcoming Beach Boys album,
to be released on Capitol. The al-
bum will_also include several
previously released songs that
have been used in movies. The
label reportedly shelled out
$500,000 in advance for the
soundtrack compilation on the
condition it include at least three
new tracks. '

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April l3, i989

Continued from page 18'

Ross cast her as Chris Penn's
(Sean's brother) aggressive girl-
friend in the smash hit Footloose.
A string of movies followed, in-
cluding Somewhere Tomorrow,
Girls /ust Wanna Have Fun and
Michael Apted’s First Born with
Terri Carr and Peter Weller.
Recently, Parker has complet-

’ ed projects for Disney and NBC,

including Flight ofthe Navigator
and Dada is Death.

Her crowning achievement,
though, was last year's critically
successful series about one fami-
ly’s tribulations and triumphs,
called A Year in the Life.

The show brought much suc-
cess and prestige for the young
actress and although NBC has
since canceled the show, Sarah
still feels as if it were her own fa-
mily that split up.

”We were literally a family,”
she says. '’I mean, it wasn't like

 

this film [Equal justice] where
people come and go, in and out
and do their scenes and leave.
Everybody came to the set every-
day whether they were in the
scenes or not. And I felt absolute-
ly crushed when the series went
off the air, not because I was out
of work, but because we loved
each other so much.

”It was hard to say goodbye. I
have never experienced that be-
fore. I mean, when Square Pegs
was canceled, I felt like ’Whoop,
big deal,’ but here it was totally
different.”

Parker also says that Thomas
Carter, who directed her in the pi-
lot miniseries for A Year in the
Life and more recently Equal
/ustice, was a godsend to the
show’s success and a director
who does not compromise his ac-
tors’ professionalism.

On the set of Equal justice, Par-

ker takes his suggestions and
comments without question.

"l’ve never trusted a director in
film or TV as much as I've trust-
ed Thomas,” she says. ”He never
cheats his actors and if he needs
to, he'll put his ass on the line for
them, which really strengthens
our relationship.”

Before coming to Pittsburgh to
film the ABC pilot, Parker had
traveled to Yugoslavia to film the
recent miniseries Twist of Fate,
which was broadcast on NBC last
month.

Although she feels the film was
a "quick job, cut and splice,” the
experience of working overseas
with top-notch performers like
Ben Cross, John Glover and Paul
Freeman was quite a remarkable
adventure.

''I looked at the call sheet the
first day and realized 'My God,
these people are really big.’ And
there I was, hardly anything. Af-

ter finishing my role as Kay on A
Year in the Life, I was really
depressed. But the director, Ian
Sharp, was very nice. ‘He made
me feel right at home, you know,
telling jokes and making me
laugh!’

Then, without wasting a
minute, Sarah was back home in
Los Angeles for two days before
she got the call to work in
Pittsburgh.

The pilot episode for Equal
justice, scheduled to air on ABC
during the early fall season, con-
tains an ensemble cast, sixty-
seven speaking parts and a Pitts-
burgh backdrop. The City of
Bridges is used as the setting to
tell the story of several district at-
torneyswho struggle for personal
and legal victories in their every-

day lives. Some critics say it is the

flip—side to L.A. Law, illustrating
the gritty, hard—working life of the
city prosecutor.

Parker plays Joanne Harris, a
young, inexperienced district at-
torney whose own sense of
justice conflicts with the political
ideas of her superiors. ‘

"What I like about Joanne is
that she's so fresh and naive. She
is incredibly young for her job,
almost like the baby in the fami-
ly. Although she is depicted as
the underdog, there is a lot of
sympathy generated for her
character by the others.”

With Equal Justice now under
wraps in post—production, Parker
says she wants to relax for a
while.

'’I don't have anything lined up

right now,” she chuckles. "But '

I'm definitely going to take a va-
cation. l'll probably just lie
around or something, but I can't
wait because I've only been
home six days in the past three
years!”

Although she's taking a vaca-
tion (she plans to spend time with
her family in New York), Parker
says she feels compelled to work
constantly. -

"lt's probably something deep-
ly neurotic,” she explains. ”It’s a
sort of stamp of validity. When
you're working, it means you're
somebody who exists. I can't say

\

' I'm an actor when I'm not work-

ing. Being involved in a project,
whether it be film or television,
is like someone telling you that
you exist, that you're not living in
an illusory world, that you are, in
fact, an actor."

Rowing club set to  
make waves in W. Va.

By John Labriol

Staff Writer ‘-

The Panther Rowing Club trav-
els to Charleston, W.Va., this
weekend to compete in the
Governor's Cup Races and hopes
to repeat the success they found
last Saturday in the King of the
River competition in Pittsburgh.

The rowers floated away with
two victories in the'men’s divi-
sion and two defeats in the wom-
en's division against Carnegie
Mellon and Duquesne.

Mercyhurst was also scheduled
to compete last weekend but
dropped out. '

The Panthers, under the coach-
ing skills of Kendra Follet and Joel
Kehm, have been rowingin two
different boat classes, heavy-
weight boat and lightweight boat.

The average weight of each
participant in the heavyweight
boat is 150 pounds (women's di-
vision) and 200 pounds (men's
division); while the average

6 weight of each participant in the

lightweight boat is 120 pounds
(women's division) and 160
pounds (men's division).

In the Panthers heavyweight
boat (men's division) were cox-

swain Leanna Hopkins and row-
ers Todd Ridenour, Jeff Evers,

John Kelly and captain Pete-

Alpern.

”CMU gave us a real run for
our money in the beginning,”
said Ridenour, ”but we pulled
ahead about five boat lengths [ap-
proximetly 70 feet], and there
was no way they could catch us.”

In the Panthers lightweight boat
(men's division) were coxswain
Marilu Tesceo and rowers Chris
Galvinick,‘Eric Howard, Bob Falk
and Graham Ternbull.

”The light boat was a real sur-
prise,” said Ridenour.

”They got into a really power-

nful swing, and you could tell that

they were working together.”

Although the Lady Panthers
lost, captain Rose Silay was
proud of the effort her teammates
displayed.

Rowing for the Panthers
heavyweight boat (women's divi-
sion) were coxswain Erika Brigg
and rowers Silay, Chris Ruff, Suz-
zanne Rublein and Trisha

Hot lacrosse team is

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

The Pitt lacrosse squad has be-
gun to make a serious impact in

the Allegheny Lacrosse League, ‘

reeling off three more victories
within the past week to put them-
selves in the top of the division.

The Panthers started the sensa-
tional seven-day period’ by nail-
ing Bethany College last
Thursday at Pitt Stadium by a 4-1
margin. That victory avenged one
of only two losses that Pitt has
suffered in 1989.

Then, on Sunday, Pitt proceed-
ed to travel to Wheeling and to
try and to improve on a dismal
0-2 road record. They accom-
plished the task, beating their op-
ponents by a narrow 3-2 margin
for the first victory registered any-

I where other than Pitt Stadium.

Pitt trailedearly, 2-0, and then
came out to score the last three
goals. Harper Watters and Lee
Stember knotted the score at two,
and then with approximately six
minutes left in the game, Phil
Preston broke free in front of the
Wheeling net and deposited a,
Stember pass into the goal for the
go-ahead and eventual winning

. point.

”That was a big game for us,”
Pitt co—captain Michael Neuman
said. ”That was our first road win.
Everybody was just exhausted af-
ter the comeback.” .
The only person who would be

. extremely tired after the next

game. however, should have

' been the SCOI‘€'K€€D€.'.

Borisoff and Brian Oles scored-

two goals apiece, while Preston
and Watters also contributed
offensively with scores.

In addition to the offensive
bombardment, Panther defenders
held CMU to only 13 shots on
net —- Pitt had 29 in comparison
— while Pitt goalie Skip Leezer
continued his recent hot streak.

Ironically, CMU had beaten
Pitt by an identical margin last
year, when the club was just get-.
ting started; In an earlier match-
up this year, Pitt squeezed out a
5-4 victory.

-”That was a ‘huge payback
from_ last year,” Neuman stated.
”Earlier this season, we beat them
5-4, but we were without a cou-
ple of guys then.

v ”They actually thought that‘

they were better than us. We just
had to prove that we are such a
dominant team over them, so we
went out and crushed them.”
Co-captain Orfeu Buxton also
relished in the win that raised
Pitt's overall record to 7-2 and set
up a monstrous matchup with
perhaps the best team in the ALL,
Washington and Jefferson Col-
lege, tonight at Pitt Stadium.

”The biggest thing was that we
only let them have those 13
shots,” Buxton said. ”That, and
Lee just went nuts; all of those
goals came in the first half.

”We didn't even play the
whole game. Late in the game,
the official looked around and
lust said out loud ‘Tell me. where
is this game really going?‘ and
called time and the game. That
was JIJSl an unheard of thing.”

CULVER CITY, Calif. — Su-
gar Ray Robinson, whose
name and style spawned a
generation of imitators, died
Wednesday, remembered as
the real ”Sugar Ray,” the best
fighter pound-for—pound who
ever lived. '

Robinson, who held both
the world welterweight and
middleweight titles, died after
a long illness at the age of 67.
Although details were not im-
mediately available, Robinson
had been reported to be suffer-
ing from Alzheimer's disease
as well as diabetes and hyper-
tension.

Robinson retired from box-
ing in 1965 after a record of
175-19-6 with 1 10 knockouts.
He won the vacant world
welterweight title on Dec. 20,
1946, with a 15-round deci-
sion over Tommy Bell and
never lost a fight to a welter-
weight the rest of his career.

”Generations of fighters co-

pied his style, including Mu-
hammad Ali,” said Archie
Moore, former light
heavyweight champion and a
friend for nearly 50 years. ”Ali
got a lot ofhis style from
Robinson;  We'll all miss
him‘. I know I'll miss him.”
_ Robinson won the midd-
_leweight title when he stopped
Jake LaMotta in the 13th round
on Feb. 14, 1951, in Chicago.
When he "r.r_iet..;_La/Motta, his
record already was 119-1-2.

Perhaps his most, memora-
ble' rivalry was with Gene
Fullmer, whom he beat only
once in four meetings. He lost

the middleweight title to
Fullmer on Jan’. 2, 1957, on a
15-round decision, then
regained it on May 1 in Chica-
go with one of the most fa-
mous one—punch knockouts in
boxing history, ending that
fight in the fifth round.

He and Fullmer fought to a
draw on Dec. 3, 1960, and he
lost a 15-rounddecision to
Fullmer on March 4, 1961 in
Las Vegas.

”He was a good fighter,
probably one of the best,”
Fullmer said. ”He was rangy.
He was fast,’ quick and smart.

”I always admired him and
appreciated the fact that he
gave me the chance to win the
championship. He was a
classy fighter.”

Former heavyweight cham-
pion Larry Holmes, reached
by telephone in Philadelphia,
described Robinson as a pi-
oneer and ”the greatest little
fighter that I've known.”

Said Holmes: "A lot of times
people say Muhammad Ali
was the greatest of all time. He
was the greatest of his time.
Larry Holmes was the greatest
of his time. Mike Tyson is the
greatest of his time.

”Sugar Ray Robinson was
the man, along with Joe Louis.
Those two guys opened the
door for the rest of us. Anytime
you get into a conversation
about old-time greats, those
are the two people everyone
talks about.”

Los Angeles County

coroner's" spokesman Bob

Dambacher said Robinson
was pronounced dead at
10:09 am. at * Brotman
Memorial. ”It appears to be of

Sugar Ray Robinson dies at age 63

natural causes,” he said.

The coroner's office was in-
volved because it had been
some time since Robinson had
seen his private physician,
Dambacher said.

”We will be investigating
the circumstances surrounding
his demise and taking care of
the cause and manner of
death,” he said. ’’It does not
appear at this time there will
be an autopsy. We will know
more tomorrow."

Judy Davis, the public rela- -
tions at Brotman Memorial,
said Robinson was brought to
the hospital's emergency room
by paramedics at 9:55 a.m.,
along with his wife Millie.

Davis declined to describe
his symptoms.

”His family called paramed-
ics this morning, they brought
him in,” she said. ”We can't’
comment beyond that.”

In Las Vegas, boxing '
promoter Bob Arum said .-
Robinson had been in poor
health for some time.

”Sugar Ray Robinson was
the greatest boxer that ever
lived," Arum said.

’ ':Number one, he could box A
like (Sugar Ray) Leonard or
Ali. Tremendous reflexes, 4’
great movement. He also had
the power of a Tommy Hearns
and he was a complete fight-
er. Every aspect of boxing —

_ defense, offense, movement —

R_ay Robinson possessed. He“

’ was the complete fighter.”

Fontescalls Sanders a rare player 

STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) —.
Detroit ‘Lions coach Wayne
Fontes said Wednesday that Heis-
man Trophy winner Barry
Sanders is better than he thought
and is a rare player who comes
along only once in a while.

Fontes, Atlanta Falcons coach
Marian Campbell and Kansas
City Chiefs coach Marty Schot—
tenheimer were among represen-
tatives of eight NFL teams in

. Stillwater to watch Sanders dur-

ing a 45-minute workout at Ok-
lahoma State University.
Sanders, a true junior, won a
special exemption from the Na-
tional Football League last__ week
to allow him to be eligible for the
league's college draft on April 23.
”If the draft was today, I'd take
Barry Sanders,” Fontes said after
the workout and a private meet-
ing with the running back.
”He’s a player that would help
our team the quickest and help us
get into the end zone the

quickest.

”Every time he would do
something, all the other coaches
and scouts were looking our
direction and I just looked back
as if to say ‘no chance, guys.’ This
is our guy, a rare piaver that
comes along just once in a
while.” Fontes said.

Fontes said Sanders, who

[rushed for 2,628 yards and

scored 39 touchdowns last sea-
son. had an excellent workout.

Sanders ran the 40-yard dash in ;

that he wasn't that fast,” Fontes
said. ”But. on the film we

Easy Goer challenges
Secretariat's reputation

Easy Goer burst across the fin-
ish line in the Gotham Stakes,
one-fifth of a second off the fastest
mile ever recorded for a thor-
oughbred racehorse. Jockey Pat
Day stood easily in the stirrups,
and Easy Goer galloped another
eighth of a mile, letting his
momentum die before turning to
the winner's circle.

At that moment, so, too, died
the hopes of a lot of men who
thought their horses might be
good enough to win the Ken-
tucky Derby, for the stop watches
on the backstretch kept ticking on
what probably is the best
thoroughbred since Secretariat.

Reports varied slightly from
watch to watch. Loafing through
the final furlong, Easy Goer was
timed in anywhere from 1:46 to
1:46 2-5 for 1 1/8 miles, one-
eighth of a mile more than was
required of him that day. In the
mile that mattered, Day never
once touched Easy Goer with the
whip, and did not even urge him
on with his hands. He just sat
there, going along for the ride.

That same day, last Saturday,
there were two major Kentucky
Derby prep races that did require
1 1/8 miles of their entrants.

At Hialeah, Fla., a stablemate
of Easy Goer, Awe Inspiring,
came home as the favorite in the
Flamingo Stakes by two lengths
over lrish Actor. Citation used the
Flamingo to pave the way to the
1948 Triple Crown, but Awe In-
spiring probably won’t even enter
the Derby. Anyway, his time was
1:49 3-5. Un-Awe Inspiring by
comparison.

Over on the other coast, Sun-
day Silence pushed himself
squarely into the Derby picture
with a massive upset of Houston
in the Santa Anita Derby. ”Awe—

some,” one jockey said of Sun-

day Silence, who won by 11
lengths over a very fast track. This
horse definitely will go to the
Derby. His time: 1:47 3-5.

For 1 1/8 miles — an eighth
shorter than the Derby — Sunday
Silence’s time translates to a 5 to
8-length loss to Easy Goer, figur-
ing one—fifth of a second per
length.

”Never in my life have I seen
a horse this good,” said Jean—Luc
Samyn, who rode one of the
horses Easy Goer beat. ’’I’m sure
everyone feels the same way.”

There is evidence backing Sa-
myn’s sentiment.

Over the past 10 years, Ken-
tucky Derby fields have averaged
nearly 17 entries. Although the
field was limited to 20 in 1975,
one owner, Al Risen Jr., obtained
a court order that allowed his
horse, Mythical Ruler, to finish
17th in a 21—horse field in 1981.
The low number was 10 horses
in 1979.

Although some original esti-
mates were for a field of 10 or
less, insiders at Churchill Downs
now expect anywhere from
12-14 to run on May 6. Obvious-
ly, a few owners will be scared
away by Easy Goer.

While Easy Coer is now just
about an even-money favorite,
Sunday Silence’s victory over
Houston actually may have
helped keep up the size of the
field. Sunday Silence now prob-
ably will become the second
favorite at around 4-1 or lower,
replacing the badly beaten
Houston as Easy Goer's chief
rival. Houston went into the
weekend at 7-2 and should go
slightly higher.

Horsemen figure as long as it's
a two or three-horse race, not just
a one—horse race, there's a possi-

bility the leaders will run each-

other out. Then an outsider has
a chance.

NORMAN, Okla. — An Ok-

Oklahoma City woman by
teammates Nigel Clay, Ber-

é nard Hall and Glen Bell in an

and Clay also are accused of
two counts of furnishing liquor

6Snyder, Cleveland

sock it to BoSox, 10-6

By Dave O'Hara

AP Sports Writer

"5 BOSTON — Cleveland's Cory

Snyder felt he was "struggling a
little bit,” so he took some extra

_ batting practice Wednesday.

Snyder apparently discovered
an instant cure as he drove in six
runs with a pair of two-run
homers and two RBI singles, lead-
ing the Indians to a 10-6 victory
over the Boston Red Sox.

,, "It wasjust one of those days,
31d I kept swinging the bat," said

Snyder, who also scor'ed"'four‘ “

runs as Cleveland won for the
fifth time i n seven games this sea-
son. "Days like this are hard to
come by, and I'll take them any-
time. They're very nice.”

Snyder hit his second and third
home runs of the season off
Boston starter Oil Can Boyd, who

also was tagged for a solo homer
by Dave Clark before being
relieved with none out in the
fourth.

Snyder, who had driven in just
two runs in six previous games,
had two-run homers in the sec-
ond and fourth, grounded into a
fielder's choice and later scored
in the sixth and added RBI singles
in the eighth and ninth.

Snyder's slugging marked the
fifth time he has hittwo homers
in a game since he came up to
Cleveland in 1986. He also hit
three homers against Minnesota

Qm May 21, 1987.

. "|t's talent,” Cleveland
Manager Doc Edwards said.
"When you have talent like Cory
does, you're going to have days
like this."

'’It wasn't our day," Boston
Manager Joe Morgan said after
his club fell to 2-5 for the season.
"We got plenty of hits, but not

much pitching. Oil Can was hot
and cold. He pitched good in
spots, but he made mistakes on
the home runs. That's what did
him in." -

After Boston scored a run in the
first inning on Mike Greenwell’s
bases-loaded double-play
grounder, Pete O'Brien led off the

. second with a walk, and Snyder

followed with a drive into the left-
field screen for his first homer.

The Red Sox took a 4-2 lead in
the third._Jody Reed walked and
scored on Wade Boggs' double
into the left-field corner; ‘Two outs
later, Greenwell singled home
Boggs and Jim Rice followed with
an RBI double.

But O'Brien drew another walk
to lead off the fourth, and Snyder
followed with a shot high into the
screen in left-center. Clark then
put the Indians ahead with a drive
into the right-field seats.

That finished Boyd, 0-1, who
has not beaten the Indians since
a 24-5 victory in Cleveland on
Aug. 21, 1986.

The Indians added another run

off reliever Wes Gardner in the’

sixth on a sacrifice fly by Brook
Jacoby that scored Snyder.
Snyder singled in a run off Bob
Stanley in the eighth and later
scored on Jacoby's two-run sin-
gle. Joe Carter, O'Brien and
Snyder singled in the ninth for
Cleveland's final run.

Cleveland's Bud Black, 1-1, al-
lowed seven hits and four runs in
5‘/3 innings. He struck out three
and walked two before leaving
after Rice's one-out single. Keith
Atherton pitched the last 3% in-
nings for his first save, allowing
six hits and two ninth-inning runs

.- on Rich Gedman's leadoff homer
‘and Ellis Burks’ RBI grounder.

Expos fall to strong Philly -ba ts

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Mike
Schmidt, Von Hayes and Ron
Jones homered in the third inning
off former teammate Kevin Gross
as the Philadelphia Phillies beat
the Montreal Expos 6-3 Wednes-
day night.

The Phillies, winners of three

straight, had four home runs,
three doubles and a triple off
Gross, 1-1, who was traded to
Montreal in the offseason.
After the Phillies took a 2-0
lead in the second on Darren
Daulton’s third home run of the
season, they boosted it to 5-0 in

the third with the three solo
home runs.

Don Carman, 1-0, was the
benefactor of the Phillies’ extra-
base-hit lode. He pitched 6 1-3
innings, allowing two runs on
four hits.

Ryan sets Texas strikeout record

MILWAUKEE (AP) ~ Nolan
Ryan allowed one hit in eight
shutout innings and struck out a
team—record 15 batters Wednes-
day night as the Texas Rangers
beat the Milwaukee Brewers 8-1.

Ryan, who has pitched a record
five no—hitters, did not give up a
hit until Terry Francona singled in
the eighth after a walk to Glenn
Braggs. Ryan retired the next
three batters.

CHICACOIAP) Mitch Wil-
liams stymied a ninth—inning
comeback, getting his fourth
save as the Chicago Cubs beat

Wednesday night for their fifth
straight victory.

his first National League victo-
ry. Scott Terry, 0-1, took the
loss but was hit by a pitch in
the third inning and left the

Reliever Craig McMurtry gave
up a run on three hits in the ninth.

Ryan, 42, raised his all-time
strikeout record to 4,798. He sur-
passed the Texas single—game
mark of 14 strikeouts by Bert
Blyleven and Jim Bibby, the only
two Rangers to pitch no—hitters.

Ryan, who has never pitched a
perfect game, did not permit a
runner until Robin Yount walked
on a 3-2 pitch with two outs in

Yankees snap skid

NEW YORK (AP) —— Rickey
Henderson's two-run single
snapped a sixth-inning tie
Wednesday night, leading
New York past the Toronto
Blue Jays 5-3 and ending the
Yankees’ seven—game losing
streak.

John Candelaria pitched
four-hit ball for eight innings as
the Yankees won for the first
time since their opening day.
They had been outscored

59.-19 coming into the game.

Tied at 3, Don Slaught start-
ed the sixth with his third sin-
gle of the game. After Torn

Tony Castillo intentionally

Henderson singled to left on a
3-2 pitch. ’

”I think he said ‘I want to
talk to you  and she just
walked in with him,’ " Fennell
said.

The woman had testified
Monday that someone
grabbed her and led her into
the darkened bedroom and
began unzipping her dress.
Fennell said the zipper, which
ran diagonally across the front
of the dress, was not un-
zipped.

Fennell said Hall turned out
the lights in the bedroom.
Soon, he and others in the
front room heard a scream and
he, Clay, Keith Traylor and
Bell ran into the bedroom.

He said Hall tried unsuc-
cessfully to have intercourse
with the woman and then Clay
attempted to have intercourse
with the woman while Hall sat
on her upperibody. Fennell
said the woman told Hall
" ’take your hand off my
mouth. I can't breathe. I'll do
anything you want.’ "

Clay then got up, Fennell
said, and-Hall tookehis-place
and ”that’s when he penetrat-
ed her.”

a guy before,’ " Fennell said.

Fennell said Clay and Bell’
then had sex with the woman,
but he did not.

He said Traylor was off in a
corner of the room during the
attack.

Fennell said before the at-
tack Hall had told him ”if we
have to we're going to take
some from her.” McCoy asked
Fennell what Hall meant by
”some,” and Fennell said
”sex."

Fennell testified he went to
his own room after the attack.

Under cross-examination by
attorney Fred Shaeffer, Fennell
said he gave investigators from
McCoy's office different stories
the first two times he was in-
terviewed. ] i

’’I told him [the investigator]
twice two different ones. The
third time I came out and told
him everything,” Fennell said.

Fennell also said the victim
was drunk. The woman's
friend ”had to keep reminding
her. [The woman] was sitting.

she would open her legs up

Dear Member of the University Community:

Pitt, for the third consecutive year, is participating in
"Scouting for Food," a canned food collection drive to help
combat local hunger. This year we hope to again engage the
entire University community in this important public service.
I'm sure I can count on your generous support.

This broad—based campaign covers the six ineighboring
counties of the Allegheny Trails Council of the Boy Scouts of
America . The area includes: Allegheny , Beaver , Washington ,

  
 
  
 
 
    
 
 
 

Greene, Westmoreland and Fayette counties. “Q

Approximately 20 re served by 460 food
pantries and. kitch= But food shortages,

During this p: at strategic
locations min   receives your _?
d°nat1°n5 - Coordinated by Anegheny Traits Council, Boy scouts of America ,

Any canned food in good condition is welcome, but
preferred foods include: peanut butter, chunky-type soups,
canned tuna, canned stews, canned meat, baby formula, and any_g
complete packaged meal. P

Hunger remains a serious problem in Western Pennsylvania.
"Scouting for Food" is a significant and very real way that the 
Pitt community can do something about it. A

Thank you for any support you can give us.

Vice President
