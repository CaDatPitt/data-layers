.Pitt hosts

Governor’s
new school

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Sixty academically talented high school
juniors and seniors will participate in Penn-
sylvania’s new Governor’s School for Inter-
national Studies on the Pitt campus this
summer. . a

It is the third installment of the state’s
summer residency program for gifted secon-
dary students. .

Diana Wood, academic dean for the Gov-
ernor’s School summer workshops, is coor-
dinating the university’s effort with
Kathleen White, associate dean of the new

The new school will differ from those
operating at Carnegie-Mellon University,
which hosts the Governor’s School for the
Sciences, and Bucknell University (in
Lewisburg), w ‘it sponsors the Governor’s
School for the _\rts.

The latest Governor’s School's curricu-
lum will be divided into three categories,
including Japanese language —~ in conjunc-
tion with Pitt’s East Asian Studies Program
—- economics V and cross-cultural/socio-
linguistics studies.

According to Wood, the new school is the

. first of its kind in the nation.

“There is nothing that ,1 know of and I
would say that there may not be something,”
she said. “There are other governor‘s schools
for the gifted -—~ gifted in general —- students.
But those are not specifically for interna-
tional studies.”

The five-week session will run from July I
to Aug. 3 and will cost approximately
$125,000. Governor» Dick Thornburgh
included an allocation of $75,000 for the
school in his I984-85 budget proposal. Pri-
vate contributions are expected to fill out the
rest of the financial burden.

Students applying for admission to the
Governor’s School for International Studies
will be screened under the same standards
used --at Pennsylvania’s two other summer
programs. a t

Looking for “what we describe as a strong
academic program,” Wood said the state’s
29 intermediate units, comprising the state’s
educational consortium, require students to
have two years foreign language and an
already established interest in international
issues and affairs.

Curriculum for the new school will start to
be drawn up this weekend. Participating in
the process are White, Wood, the five faculty
members who will conduct the summer
classes, faculty members for the University
Center for International Studies (UCIS)
and members of Pitt’s School of Business.

In addition to the five faculty members,

‘he new school will also sponsor guest lectur-

ers for a series of presentations.

Only the lonely

Despite their freedom and the good times, one Pitt
instructor feels single people aren’t as happy as
they seem to be. Many don’t want to get involved
and it leaves them rather empty.

French president Francois Mitterand asked that
all universities share the knowledge they have.
The problem is local universities are relunctant to
share the spotlight, not to mention computer

‘I can’

Citizens Party candidate accepts challenge

By Trade Stuflt
The Pitt News

Sonia Johnson was approached .with an
unusual request last year while on a ﬂight to
Miami, Fl.

“You’re Sonia Johnson, aren’t you?”
someone said, tapping her on the shoulder.
“Well, I am a member of the executive party
of the Citizens Party, and your name keeps
coming up as a possible candidate for presi-
dent on our ticket. Would you be
interested?”

“Oh no, that’s not what I do. But there are
women who do that," said Johnson, a lead-
ing feminist who, in December 1979, was
excommunicated from the Mormon Church
for her support of the Equal Rights
Amendment.

Johnson later changed her mind, saying,
“What was so funny about the idea of run-

‘If Ronald Reagan can go
through the motions of
being president, anyone can
do it’

-Sonia Johnson

ning for president? It was a ‘little boy’s fan-
tasy’ to be president. It wasn’t for little girls.”

The 1984 presidential candidate for the
Citizens Party came to Pittsburgh Wednes-
day evening to deliver her campaign address
at Carlow College.

TheCitizens Party began in 1980 with the
presidential campaign of Barry Commoner

and LaDonna Harris and is dedicated to

democracy at all levels of American life.
Johnson. who fasted for 37 days in Illinois

to win passage of the ERA, overcame her
original doubts and began to think, “If I
were president, I’d....”

She said, “It was amazing. I knew what to
do!

“If Ronald Reagan can go through the
motions of being president, anyone can do
it,” she said. '

Johnson led the small crowd in attend-
ance through a re-enactment of her conver-
sion experience. She told everyone to stand
and raise their arms above their heads —— a
stance that evokes power, according to
Johnson. Then they shouted, “If I were pres-
ident, I’d....” and stated what they would do
if they were president. 1

Johnson claims that this is a way of
demystifying the office of the presidency.
She responded to the crowd by saying,
“What you’ve just said is my platform.”

She ‘elaborated, saying that the world

A must be demilitarized.

“Either war is extinct, or we are.
We need to rethink how we relate
with other countries."

Johnson believes that the world
economy cannot be based on petro-
leum; we must turn our research and
development energies toward using
renewable resources.

Johnson stated that the $1 billion
the government now spends on
defense creates only 45,000 jobs,
whereas the same amount spent on
education could create 120,000 jobs.

“We must make employment into
an equal right," said Johnson, and
there must be legislation to control
the corporations in this country.

“We can’t afford free enterprise
anymore."

To effect change, there must be a
“revolution in our values,” accord-
ing _to Johnson.

“Profit is not the ultimate good ——
human life is.” Now, society must
take “an evolutionary step to
survive.”

The American system of demo-
cracy does not represent women,
according to Johnson. It is setup to
“keep the powerless powerless and
the powerful powerful.” The change
Johnson advocates would incorpo-
rate non-violent, direct action and
confront the system from the out-
side. Only then, said Johnson, can
we begin to build a new world.

Sonia Johnson, 1984 Citizens Party Presidential Candidate

The pioneers of this change are
the feminists, said Johnson. “We are
the new mind and we must build the
world as we want it.”

Johnson decided to run on the
Citizens Party ticket because of its
dedication to the rights of women.
Fifty percent or more of allthe lead-
ership positions in the party are -
and by the party’s constitutional
mandate must be — held by women.

—— Sonia Johnson

Johnson also believes that a third
party must exist as a democratizing
force in our system for “any good or
revolutionary new ideas and
changes” to take effect.

The Citizens Party is small, but,
according to Johnson, “it never
takes a lot. We’re enough.”

Johnson stressed that feminism is
not an issue - it is a world view, a
new way of life. Now, and through-

out all history, it has been natural to
oppress, said Johnson.

“But women say it is not natural
to oppress.”

Our society has always been
divided, according to Johnson, but
not by classes. There are only two
sides — male culture and female cul-
ture — and, as history illustrates,
one half rules and oppres_ses _the
other half. Johnson maintains,

though, that “as long as any of us are
oppressed. we all are oppressed."

Male culture, said Johnson, has
narrowed over time because it has
not been challenged. Two basic
values of the male culture have influ-
enced American life beyond belief,
according to the presidential candi-
date. and are especially evident in
our political system: to “stand tall in
the saddle, and, at all costs, don’t
appear weak.” Thus, the male cul-
tures solution to conflict is through
military strength.

Johnson said that men cannot
listen to one another, for to be a
listener is to be “one down.” The
male culture stereotype requires
domination. He must “save face.”

Johnson supports the much dif-
ferent women’s culture and accom-
panying characteristics: listening,
patience and an ability to look at the
But women are de-
spised and loathed according to
Johnson, and men hate the womanly
characteristic within themselves.

“We have to do a most revolution-
ary thing. We have to love women
and the womanly. We have to cher-
ish her characteristics and values,
and we-have to refuse male culture,”
said Johnson.

“I want the world better for
everybody.”

TV’s Roll

As the Democratic candidates for president roll into town,
they are inevitably preceded by a wave of personal and party
commercials. These commercials generally elaborate on very
few issues, tending to sound more like ads for a used car than
forums for the leader of the free world. Prepare yourself to sift
out the policy from the publicrelations.

The Mondale campaign’s use of the trendy “Where’s the
beef” slogan brought intelligent debating in this campaign to
the brink of extinction. On April 6th, Pittsburgh will play host
to the great travelling sideshow, known otherwise as the Demo-
cratic candidates debate. '

Last night’s debate at New York’s Columbia University,
however, pointed out that the candidates are still trying to win
this race through rhetoric rather than an appeal to the issues
and a healthy respect for the intelligence of the American voter.
Front-runners Mondale and Hart have shamelessly quibbled
and nit-picked over one another’s TV commercials and when
they announced support for certain policies. The two seem to
be getting more political mileage out of their juvenile histrio-
nics than over statements on the economy, employment, or
foriegn policy.

It’s time for the candidates to return to the issues, and to
forget when they adopted certain policies. It is far more impor-
tant that their decisions be congruent with their voting records.

Advertisements should be used to highlight policies or
expose verifiable grievances with opponents. They are a side-
show to the main arena — the debates.

This group of ’burghers have had enough of their beef.

Computer Gap

French President Francois Mitterand commanded a great
deal of attention during his visit to Pittsburgh Tuesday even-
ing. His address to an audience at Carnegie-Mellon University,
seen by an over-ﬂow crowd and heard by thousands, calledfor a
sharing of computer knowledge between the haves and have-
nots.

Clearly, CMU stands as a member of the former with its
Robotics Institute and other computer projects, including
campus-wide networking and plans for “a computer in every
room.”

In his speech, entitled “The New_Developments of Man
Through Computer Science,” Mitterand suggested that the
world's universities follow a path leading to computer literacy
for all. He understood that developments in the technological
revolution are means to an end of solidarity and greater under-
standing among all the world’s people.

Mitterand’s ideal that information should and can be dis-
itributed fairly, however supported for the TV cameras Tues-
day, has had trouble surviving even the small distance between

' Pitt and CMU, let alone the entire world.

Both universities have spent countless dollars and an endless
amount of time and resources preparing themselves as players
in the high-tech games of the new industrial revolution. Both
have made computer literacy and advanced communications
technology priorities in their agendas of the next ﬁve years.
And both have done all they can to portray themselves as
leaders of such develpoment in the Pittsburgh area.

Seldom have the two made any outward attempts at sharing
their goals and advancements in the spirit of Mitterand’s
address. The decision makers at Pitt and CMU have locked
themselves in competition with each other to establish the
leading edge of everything that is new.

Mitterand’s remarks serve to place the wonders of the com-
puter age in the proper international focus. Pitt and CMU need
to follow his lead and begin to articulate their separate interests
and hopes as part of a greater effort toward economic and
political survival. e

If two universities can find room for each other‘s computer
dreams on the strip of Forbes Avenue, then possibly Mitte-
rand’s aim of world understanding and development through
the free ﬂow of knowledge might become a reality.

Letters To The Editor

Senate Pres.
pushes student

involvement

Mr. Dixon, in the Wednesday,
March 28, issue of The Pitt News, is
somewhat confused. The University
Senate meets once a term. All stu-
dent members of the 14 senate com-
mittees have voting rights at
meetings of the full senate.

Each of the 14 committees has
three student representatives. The
senate office makes every effort to
send notices of meetings to students;
sometimes the only address that we
have is the Student Government
Office. These committees meet at
least once a month, but the Educa-
tional Policies, Budget Policies and
Tenure and Academic Freedom
Committees meet every two weeks.

The Senate Council meets every
month. Students do not need to
attend the Council meetings -
unless they would simply like to
observe operations of a complex
organization. There are six students
who can vote. Ken Stram and one
other undergraduate have appeared
at every council meeting since the
last election. Indeed, Mr. Stram
entered a motion on the internship
program, and senate committees are
active.

Each month, the Faculty Assem-
bly meets. No students belong to the
assembly, but meetings are open.

Committee meetings are not dra-
matic. People talk, a policy gets
drafted, questions get asked. Finan-
cial and educational decisions are
now being made which will turn into
actions in the next one, two or five
years. Participating in the university
governance is a wonderful oppor-
tunity for students to observe and
understand complex institutions.
The new student representatives
should serve as the channel for stu-

dent contribution to the university.

Racism by ,
anyone can t

be tolerated

During the current I984 presiden-
tial campaign, Rev. Jesse Jackson
made a remark that was viewed as
anti-Semitic. In a private conversa-
tion, Jackson referred to New York
City as “Hymie Town" or “Jew
Town." This “slip of the tongue” was
misrepresented and grossly exagger-
ated by the media. Through persist-
ent negative reporting, Jackson has
been stigmatized as anti-Semitic.

As a consequence of this media
event, Jackson went before a Jewish
group where be publicly apologized
for his error. It is unfortunate that
there was no extensive reporting of
his apology; consequently, a major-
ity of the public still may be under
the impression that he is anti-
Semitic.

Just as Jackson made an inap-
propriate remark, a racial slur
“slipped from the tongue” of a dis-
tinguished professor here at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. In a recent
lecture, the professor told a joke in
which part of the punch line con-
tained the word “nigger.” As a black
student, I was deeply offended and
after class, I approached the profes-
sor and made him aware of my out-
rage. To my surprise, he was
shocked by my attitude, but he apol-

ogized for his remark.

What the professor and Rev.
Jackson have failed to realize is that
neither Jewish people nor black peo-
ple are yet free enough to let slurs go
unanswered. Unlike those who
sought to slander Jackson, 1 am not
seeking public exposure of my pro-

‘ fessor nor a public apology. As far as

I am concerned, he apologized to me
with genuine sincerity.

Whether or not he is a racist is not
for me to determine, nor is it the
place of the media to go beyond the
evidence —- to jump to conclusions.
Unintentioned statements need not
be a reflection of one’s total charac-
ter, and they should not be taken out
of context.

It is evident that in 1984, interra-
cial relations are still far from satis-
factory. However, it is the
responsibility of each individual to
deal with people of different ethnic
backgrounds fairly and openly.

As public figures, Jackson and
this professor «must adapt their
remarks to their audiences; care
should be exercised and they should
make their comments and lectures as
sensitive to all people as possible.
Also, all of us should be careful,
even in private conversations, not to
denigrate others on the basis of race,
religion, ethnicity and the like.

Chancellor’s Teaching Fellow

Pitt student

finds ERA
deceptive

After reading The Pitt News over
the past several months while
attending Pitt part-time, I have
reacted to various articles and have
determined to give my rebuttal.
Your staff seems to promote anti-

Reagan sentiment in all its efforts.
makes America appear to be bad
guys in all foreign policies and gives
continued sentimental opinions why
the public should accept homosexu-
ality and lesbianism as normal.

However, the article that really
caused me to question your journal-
istic abilities, integrity and fair pre-
sentation was the article written by
Mary Ann Kasofsky concerning the
passage of the ERA Amendment, on
Monday, March 26.

I have read Phyllis Sch1afly‘s liter-
ature concerning ERA as well as
other related literature, and they are
all raising some legitimate questions
about the far-reaching legal ramifi-
cations of this amendment.

The amendment, if passed, in its
present form of 24 words, does not
clarify the following:

0The drafting of women and
mothers in the armed forces and
their role in combat.

- 0The legal status of women in
each state, when divorced, possibly
forcing equal liability for financial
responsibility and thus forcing more
women into the working world with
no parent to care for the children.

0The demands of homosexuals
and lesbians for legal marital rights,
the adoption ‘of children as well as
the teaching of the gay sexual life in
all public school systems.

Please, do not tell me that this
could not happen! After reading
goals of the book entitled “Sex Bias
in the U.S. Code: A Report of the
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights"
published in April I977, I realized
that the above concerns are legiti-
mate and would be tested in the
courts. The authors ofthis book are
very clear in their aims to state that
all their proposed changes listed in
“Sex Bias" are needed in order to
achieve “the equality principle" of
ERA.

I think it would be fair to your
readers to publish the full aims of the
I982 NOW Convention, which
voted to make lesbian rights the
organization's No. l resolution and
something it hopes to gain with the
passage of ERA.

I am weary of people in positions
of responsibility and legislative
capacity telling me that this amend-
ment will simply provide men and
women with political and economic
equity. There is much more at stake
in this amendment then we can fully
recognize, and I am not deceived.

From where Istand/ Phyllis Gray

Censorship claimed over “Palestinian”

Approximately two weeks ago, I
was asked by a member of the
Young Socialists to attend a film
regarding the situation in Lebanon,
“The Palestinian,” starring Vanessa
Redgrave. Considering that I have a
brother who is an officer in the U-
nited States Marines as well as a
pilot, I always welcome any new
insights into international events.
My brother could at any time be told
to participate in or lead one of the
various “peace keeping” missions
sponsored by the United States in
the world today. P

I was told that the meeting and the
film would start at 7 p.m. on March
21, 1984, in the William Pitt Union. I
had seen signs saying that the meet-
ing had been postponed and some
posters saying that it had been
moved. I retreated to Dining Room
B in order to see if a practical joke
was being played to confuse people.
people.

There was a man waiting there to
direct everyone to a local Unitarian
Church. After hearing the speakers
and seeing the film, I was not at all
devastated or overwhelmed by what

I had seen or heard. There was
nothing in the film that all of us do
not already know or at least have an
intuition about.

Afterward I questioned the
Young Socialist organizers as to
why the film was moved from the
convenience of the William Pitt
Union to a church on Ellsworth and
Morewood. The response of the
member .did devastate and over-
whelm me.

The university administration
retracted permission for the film the
day it was to be shown. The reason:
Zionist pressure by a local Zionist
spokesman, Rabbi Levine, also
chairman of the Campus Chaplains
Association. Rabbi Levine phoned
Vice Chancellor of Student Activi-
ties Andrew Smith. Smith was
warned that violence might_ erupt

should the film be shown. I also

learned that Levine had supported a
picket of this same film two years
ago. It appeared as though this time
more than a picket‘ was being
threatened.

In a meeting where Andrew Smith

was questioned by the YS organiz-
ers, he stated that the only reason for
the cancellation of the film was that
the leaflets did not say that the
Young Socialist meeting was for
organizational purposes.

The film itself made me much
more aware of the high extent of
separatism in the world today. Not
only in the United States between
blacks and whites, old and young,
poor and rich, but all over the world.
The idea of prejudice was used by
Hitler during the Third Reich and
the second World War. It was used
to single out and discriminate. Not
only against the Jewish people, but ’
against all people who did not fit the
criteria set by Hitler for what he per-
ceived as the pure race.

Individualism taken to an ’
extreme is very destructive. It makes
people self-centered to such an
extent that theyjudge the world and
those in it based on themselves. If a
person is seen to be different, we
tend to shy away and criticize the
differencesin the other person.

Most people misunderstand the

concept of racism and the historical
holocaust caused by Hitler’s Third
Reich. It was not based on Hitler’s
hatred of the Jewish people. The
racial conflict is what surfaced; the
real issues lie beneath the surface of
what we usually see. The issue is one
of class conflict.

Both Zionist Israel and the Third
Reich of Hitler are representative of
capitalism at its most degenerate
state; fascism. A careful study of his-
tory could not easily overlook this
comparison; ignorance of past and
present issues can.

It must be clearly understood that
I am in no way anti-Semitic, and
neither are those people who wish to
further educate themselves on the
Middle East crisis. These issues are

relevant to all of us.

We must be aware that Zionism is
not a religious ideology; it is a politi-
cal movement that began early in
this century. Judaism is a religion,
one of the most ancient and
respected. Therefore, if one is

. against a political ideology, it does

not logically follow that one is

against a religion or a race of people.

The concluding statement made
by the main speaker in the film, Abu
Giyad, was that the Palestinian peo-
ple do not want war and do not want
the removal of the Jewish people out
of the land we call Israel. They
would like to be able to return and

live in peace as they were before I948 \

and to have the area officially
renamed by the United Nations.

The idea of peace is becoming a
concept more and more difficult to
comprehend, and the idea of politi-
cal separatism is becoming more and
more easy to see and to feel.

It is difficult enough to stay
informed about the important issues
concerning us today; politicians so
gracefully side-step them with care-
fully planned rhetoric. This film is a
way of people in this country taking
it upon themselves to become
informed. It is our right to demand
as much information about_an issue
as possible as well as _our right to
judge for ourselves how weperceive
that information. It is not the place
of any administration or its officials
to deny anyone this right.

Taking airn/ Kevin F laherty \

The magnitude of the folly of the
American worker has come to my
attention over the last several years,
and the unwarranted, inexorable
greed that has so permeated the
minds of the many may most
appropriately be referred to as the
“Entitlement Syndrome.”

{Surely we have recently seen the
most blatant displays of such a sub-
versive” syndrome in our labor
unions. How any group of rational
human beings could possibly pre-
sume that a progressively less pro-
ductive performance should warrant
an increase in wage is singularly per-
plexing. In these financially tumul-

_ tuous times we can no longer afford

 

to pay a Detroit assembly line
worker nearly $30,000 a year while
many school teachers still. earn less
than $20,000. Not only are the auto-
mobile, steel, and other heavy indus-
tries no longer internationally
competitive, but the “get away with
murder” attitude ' in many union-
protected shops has led to corrup-
tion, laziness, apathy on the job and,
in some cases, an inferior product.
The American work ethic has sof-
tened considerably over the last 50
years, thanks largely to our increas-
ing dependence upon social pro-
grams and government handouts.
We all want to nurse at the Federal
Mother’s breast, yet one needs only

Americans still find honor in a~day’s

to look around to see that it can‘t go
on forever. Sure,’we all want to get
all that is coming to us, and the
laborer is worthy of his wage, but,
things must be brought into balance
—— and soon. So what if you're
“entitled”‘to three more months of
unemployment benefits? So what if
the job pays less than you can make
on unemployment?

Our founding fathers understood‘

V what it meant to work for a living in

a way that we seem to have lost sight
of, and the key element is personal
integrity —— making a way where
there is none. It is historically factual
that New England was for the most
part settled by the Puritans, who

were initially governed by a man
named John Winthrop. The Puri-
tans were by far the most successful
of the settlers of their era and their
work ethic was by far the most rigor-
ous, pervading every area of their
lives and further fomented by their
Judeo-Christian perspective. '

They expected no free ride in the
remote wilderness of North Amer-
ica, and-were well aware of the con-
sequence of idleness — starvation.
Yet, they went far beyond. basic sur-

vival, systematically subduing and

conquering the land." It therefore

_ I submit to you that there is honor
in a good day’s work, and we need to

Somewhere in Oakland/ William Pierce

It has been several weeks now
since the United States has removed
its troops from the soil of Lebanon.
What is to show from this expe-
rience and are there lessons to be
learned? The United States i may
have lost some prestige in the area,
granted. But how much cannot be
determined in the short run. In the
long run, I believe the loss will not
be that great. Not as great as if we
had stayed too long.

The Soviets, through the Syrians,
have not taken over and will not.
Lebanon’s constitution is an out-
datedldocument that, through law,
perpetuated unequal representation

the under-represented.

The United States cannot con-
tinue to paternalize the rest of the
world. It produces disaster. Now,
through the Syrians’ effort, the con-
stitution is being restructured to
provide for better representation.

nation.

The Syrian leadership has,
through the years, leaned toward a
more Pan-Arab movement. By end-
ing the bloodshed in Lebanon this

goal can be better reached. Also, by
attempting to stabilize Lebanon, the
Israelis will have less justification in
occupying Lebanon. Further, the
Palestinian question wi lbe easier to
deal with.

This all adds up to a growing
Syrian influence in the region. This
is not necessarily an evil. There is no
denying the Syrians receive a great
deal of aid from the Soviets. Soviet
technicians even man Surface to Air
Missiles (SAM) sites in Syrian ter-
ritory. President Assad is a shrewd
leader of Syria and has survived sev-
eral wars with Israel, a minority rule
in his country and severe economic

conditions. Yet, he has remained in.

control for many years. He is a very
clever man. Assad would not risk his
leadership on adventurism by his
Soviet suppliers. Besides, the
Soviets have shown little inclination
to intervene in the area.

So what would it mean if the Mid-
dle East became more cohesive as a
geographic region with a strong
Syria? The states in the region still
need Western goods and technol-
ogy. The oil still needs buyers and
the West is a major consumer. The
ties would remain in place. The rhet-

oric may become stronger.
Finally, there are two lessons we

should learn. The first lesson is a
repeat of an older one -— Vietnam.
We cannot, across the board‘, use
military force to solve all foreign
affairs goals, especially ambiguous»
conflicts like the Lebanese Civil
War.

, Secondly, now that we have with-
drawn frqn the airport, we seem
unwilling to accept the consequen-
ces. It’s_as if no one tried to figure
out what would happen if our policy
was wrong; and now we complain
and say “aw gee” and kick the dirt.

For once, an administration must

accept "responsibility for its actions
as failure and geton with building
new policy. But please look to the
past failures. Ask the right question.

“Why did it fail?” Don’t repeat I

blunders.

This is not a call for retrenchment
or isolation. It is a call for bringing
U.S. foreign policy into line with
current circumstances. We have
been operating in the past for too
long. It is time to begin to look
toward something new in foreign
policy. The old ideas are dead and

must be replaced by new. .

Obedience Day:

Preparing for war

By Lisa B. Keer
The Pitt News

The city of Pittsburgh has plans
for people in the event of a nuclear
war, and this weekend, Pittsburgh
families will test those plans as part
of Civil Obedience Day.

“We will memorialize government
instructions for a nuclear attack by
obeying them,” said Tim Barner of
the World Federalist Association, a
local group taking part in the
observance.

The day is sponsored by the
World, Future Society. The observ-
ances will begin on Friday, March
30, at 7:15 p.m. with a lecture at One
PPG Place entitled “How to Cope
With the Nuclear Age.”

On Saturday evening, Stephanie
Hughes of the World Future Society
and the six other families will ﬂee
southward from Pittsburgh to
Smithton, Pa. Smithton is on the
city’s list of safe places for relocation
in the event of a nuclear war, Hughes
said

The group will carry water, pro-..

cessed food and other necessities to a
shelter in a Universalist Church and
spend the-night. They will also tour a
fallout shelter in the area.

Other states have made plans to
observe this day. Among them, the
Students for Peace group of South-
ern Connecticut State College will
visit shelters in their area and partic-
ipate in other activities.

Lawrence University students in
Appleton, Wis., will occupy campus
fallout shelters for the entire day.

Locally, Roger Carroll, who iden-
tifies himself as a concerned Pitts-
burgher, will assemble with
interested people in a nuclear strike
epicenter simulation across from the
Hilton Hotel downtown at 8 p.m. on
Saturday. Participants will gather at
ground zero to discuss nuclear war
and distribute literature. If a nuclear
attack occurred, the Point area
would be a target, Hughes
explained.

Hughes and Barner said they hope
for \a large turnout at the public
events. “I hope the activities will
encourage people to speak out,”
Hughes said.

Drunk driving law has problems

By Kathy Krause
The Pitt News,

Since the new drunken driving
law went into effect in January of
1983, more than I00 people a week
are arrested in Allegheny County
and the consequences are critical for
those convicted.

Under the law, a_person convicted
of drunken driving is sentenced to
jail and his license is automatically
suspended. The court can also fine
the offender and order an evaluation
to measure_ his dependence on
alcohol.

“We are facing a problem of con-
sequences and one of a great magni-
tude,” said Joel Kaufman, assistant
district attorney of Allegheny
County. Kaufman was one of three
speakers who discussed the implica-
tions of the law at the Drunken
Driving Symposium Wednesday
sponsored by Pitt’s School of Law.

Those suspected of drunken driv-
ing are subjected to a breathalizer
test. Refusal of the test results in an
automatic one-year suspension of
the driver’s license.

“To be convicted of drunken driv-
ing, an alcohol level of .l0 or more
must register on the breathalizer
machine,” state trooper Cun-
ningham said.

“The law makes it much easier
now to arrest someone for drunken
driving,” said Cunningham. “A per-
son weighing 200 lbs. can drink six
beers and be at a .l0 alcohol level,
this doesn’t mean a person is neces-
sarily drunk. Most people ‘we
administer the test to are falling
down drunk and have not drunk six
beers, but more like a case.”

Karen Rock, former assistant dis-
trict attorney and now a defending
attorney discussed the problems of
the new drunken driving law.

“This is a good law but not good
enough for it infringes on people’s
rights," Rock said.

“The law requires that you as a
citizen know when you’re going to
violate so you don’t, but people have
no way of knowing when they hit the
magic number of .l0. It would be
easier for people if the law prohi-
bited drinking and driving
completely."

Rock also said the level ofalcohol
constantly. changes and a person
who has been drinking may enter his
car at a level under .10 but by the
time he is arrested, taken to the sta-
tion and given the breathalizer test
his alcohol level may exceed this
amoiint, and by this time the driver
could have been home in bed.

Another problem facing the new
law is the questionable accuracy of
the breathalizer machines.

“So many things on the machines
are geared toward the average per-
son, but not all of us are the average
person and tolerance levels differ,"
Rock said.

“There also are external factors
which affect the reading, including
radio frequencies at police stations,”
she said. “Isn’t it fascinating that we
can all go to jail because a machine
spits out a number that we can’t even

be sure is accurate?”

Board to
announce
assembly

By Colette Ferris
The Pitt News L

The Student Government Board
announced yesterday it will hold the
term’s second Student Assembly to
discuss student issues including the
University Senate appointments, the
feasibility of cable television in the
dorms and Affirmative Action
Committee progress.

The exact date of the assembly
will be announced later next week.
All student groups that did not
attend the first session are required
to attend or their assets will be
frozen.

Board member and assembly
chairman Jeff Mallinger said he
would like to see all student groups
attend the assembly even if they have
already attended the "one required.

Mallinger said the tentative
agenda includes board members
Bob Kramer speaking on the Senate
appointments, Avery Abrams
speaking on cable TV and law
school and medical school prepara-
tory classes and Pamela Hart report-
ing on affirmitive action at Pitt.

The Student Government Judicial
Board is “still being reorganized,”
according to Abrams, but advertise-
ments will be appearing soon in The
Pitt News for interested students to
apply to sit on the Judicial Board.

Applications for Election Com-
mittee chairpersbns are also being
accepted.

Governmental Relations Com-
mittee chairman John Leopold
reported on last week's lobbying
effort and conference in Washing-
ton, DC.

“We were a little disappointed,”
he said, explaining that the confer-
ence was directed away from student
issues.

Board members John Geyer,
Dave Pikovsky and Bob Kramer
and Allocations Chairman Steve
Smith went to an American Associa-

tion of University Students Confer- 

ence in North Carolina. Board
president Ken Stram said they left
Wednesday to participate in work-
shops and have been asked to
explain Pitt’s allocations process
because it is seen by other confer-
ence participants as a model process.

Neighborhood fair

Students, residents share Oakland

While visitors to the Oakland area
might mistake Forbes Avenue bars

, and fast-food operations as symp-

toms of yet another college town, the
Oakland booth at the Neighbor
Fair, currently running at the David
Lawrence Convention Center, is try-
ing to change that impression.

“The perception that Oakland
doesn't have anything to offer non-
students is unfounded,” said Amy
Hart, program director for the Col-
legite YMCA at Pitt and a graduate
student in Pitt’s school of Social
Work.

Hart said that students do repre-
sent a positive force in the commun-
ity, with 600 students volunteering
more than 87,000 hours each year
for the Collegiate YMCA at the
Shuman Center forjuvenile offend-
ers, the school for the blind and
other organizations.

The other side of Oakland —— the
residential and traditional side —— is
represented by the fact that the

The Bayard/ Belle-
field area is 93 per-
cent senior citizens.

Bayard-Bellefield area of the com-
munity is 93 percent senior citizens.
Hart also pointed out that the South
Oakland area has been home to gen-
erations of families.

Hart agreed that Oakland’s big-
gest problem is its high rate of
transiency.

“Lots of students and Pitt
employees move in and out all the
time,” she said. “This transient pop-
ulation doesn’t get to toot its own
horn.”

One local group at the Oakland
booth, Pittsburgh Action Against
Rape, is trying to increase their vis-
ibility in the community. Outreach
worker Carmen Anderson said that
her group hopes the booth will serve
to make people more aware of the
danger and prevention of assualt.

Various Oakland community
groups have joined representatives
from 46 other neighborhoods at the
fair, which runs through Sunday
April I.

Five car
collison
on Fifth
injures two

By Kathy Krause
The Pitt News

An accident involving five cars
and a PAT bus occurred on Fifth
Avenue yesterday afternoon, hospi-
talizing two unidentified young
women who were treated for minor
injuries and released at
Presbyterian-University Hospital.

The accident took place at
approximately 3:50 p.m. in front of
The Book Center near the intersec-
tion of Fifth Ave. and University

» Place when a woman driving a yel-

low Oldsmobile Delta collided with
a 7lA Negley bus in the bus lane.

The Oldsmobile then careened
into the regular lanes, striking a blue
Pontiac Sunbird, which in turn hit
three cars parked along the opposite
side of the five-lane roadway.

“We don't know whose fault it
was  the Sunbird was lodged
between one of the parked cars.-and
the curb, requiring the assistance of
the city police,” said sergeant Dave
Herr of the Pitt campus police.

“The door was pried open with a
crowbar and the two young women
were immediately taken to the hos-
pital. The girls were not seriously
injured, but they both seemed
shaken up,” Herr said.

He added that two of the cars
involved in the accident had to be
towed.

A hospital spokeswoman said one
of the women was treated for hand
cuts and confirmed that both
women had been released. She
would not, however, reveal their
names.

The Pennsylvania Council tor

International Education lobbied
successfully to the state Department
of Education for establishment of
the school. The council is composed
of many higher institutions with spe-
cial interests in international studies.

According to Wood, a lack of
state funding in the past has forced
Pitt to shy away from sponsoring a
Gove‘rnor’s School program. But
with Thornburg pledging over half
of the anticipated finances, the uni-
versity welcomed the idea.

“Pitt has been interested for quite
a while,” Wood said. “The reason
that it has just happened is that
because the state is willing to put up
a fairly large percentage of the
money. They haven't been willing in
the past. The other two schools are
completely state stiported.”

Dr. Burkart Holzner, director of
UCIS, is chairman of the Pennsylva-
nia Council for International Edu-
cation and an inﬂuence in bringing
the new school to Pitt.

“That’s a group of colleges and
universities interested in interna-
tional education at the college level,”
Wood explained. “And then there is
this interest at the secondary level
that is something they’ve been inter-
ested with, but they‘ve just finally
been able to get the state to put up
the money.”

Wooded added that “the school
will not be modeled on anything
particular.”

The 60 students to be selected in
May for the school will have all
expenses paid during their 35-day
stay. Classes will be held six days a
week.

,' Living alone: more problems than good times

By Paul Guggina
The Pitt News

Over 54 percent of the popula-
tion of Allegheny County is sin-
gle, and one of the nation’s
foremost authorities on single
living thinks many of them are
unhappy. Most ofthem, she said,
can give no reason for their
unhappiness, except that our
society equates being single with
being alone and being alone with
being lonely.

Donna Williams has been
studying the patterns of single
people for years, and she has dis-
covered that being single doesn't
always mean being alone and
that being alone should never
mean being lonely.

“Positively Singular: Before
We Can Be Happily Married,
We Must First Learn To Be
Happily Single” is the name of
the course Williams will be
teaching through the Pitt Infor-
mal Program in the Spring
Term.

Single people today are suffer-
ing from what Williams refers to
as “depleted single plight,” or
“single burnout.” According to
her surveys, over one-half of the
single population in Allegheny
County is no longer dating.

“Some people burn out as
early as 22, ‘some people who
have been married for x number
of years get out there and want to
— like a boy in a candy shop —
taste all the different kinds of
candy,” Williams said. Ifyou eat
too much, you eventually get sick
of it. lt’s the same with people. At
no other time in our history has
singlehood ever been so confus-
ing and complex while affecting
so many people.”

Williams classifies single peo-
ple in six ranks, the first and larg-

  

‘O0OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO90000900

0v<'IOttt,Ao.ui«o1vO

est rank being those who have
never been married, followed in
order of decreasing size by wid-
ows, the divorced, single parents,
cohabitators and the legally
separated. According to the 1980
Census, by 1990, over half ofthe
national population will fall into
one of those categories, encom-
passing 120 million or so people.

“This is a national problem,"
said Williams. “It’s the most
serious crisis in our history as far
as single people are concerned. If
single people would start sharing
their feelings, they would find
out that they're not unique, that
everybody is going through it,
and that would make life a lot
easier.”

The second most serious psy-
chological problem plaguing the
United States today is the “love
addiction.“ Williams said, “We
use each other as fixes, and if a
person isn’t satisfying this need
that we have, then we drop them
and go after another person. We
are not only being hurt; we’re
hurting other people. I honestly
don't think people today are
afraid to love. They’re afraid to
be hurt.”

“People want to have friend-
ships, but they are afraid that
they’re going to be hurt or used,
so they don’t. People are con-
stantly running to and running
from at the same time. It’s impos-
sible to have a relationship when
someone’s dealing with
approach-avoidance unless the
two people know it and work it
out together.

People today don’t know how
to be single, according to Willi-
ams. People are geared towards
getting married and raising a
family. Throughout their lives,
they plan on someday being
either a husband or a wife. When
they get out of college and find
themselves without a mate, they

‘If single people would start

sharing their feelings, they
wouldfind out that they are
not unique, that everybody
is going through it.’

— Donna Williams

 
 

don't know what to do or how to
act.

“in high school, we only learn
the ‘three R's,’ ” Williams said.
We are not taught how to deal
with life on an emotional, per-
sonal basis.”

According to Williams, 99.9
percent of the population does
not understand the opposite sex.
People spend far too much time
talking to or at people and not
nearly enough time talking with
them. Over half of American
men dislike going to bars, yet
they go anyway. Seventy—five
percent dislike one—night stands,
yet they happen all the time.
Americans spend an estimated
$330 billion annually on improv-
ing their external selves, on
things like flashy cars, fancy
clothing or health spa
memberships.

“If each of us would take the
time to develop our individual-
ity, we wouldn’t have to go exter-
nally for all of this fulfillment,”
Williams said.

“The majority of single people
are unhappy, regardless of how
successful they are financially or
occupationally. We have been
conditioned to look outside of
ourselves instead of to look
inward. If we can't fulfill this
nagging, empty void, how can
anyone else?”

Provost notes majorchanges

in field of international

By Willis
The Pitt ews
Political leaders and scholars

throughout the world must begin to
base their policy decisions and
recommendations on the knowledge
that “everything they do makes an
impact elsewhere in the world,"
according to Pitt Provost Roger
Benjamin.

In an informal meeting yesterday
with about 25 undergraduates from
Pitt Students Around the World
(SAW), Benjamin said that as the
world becomes “smaller” and more
interdependent, the distinction
between foreign and domestic poli-
cies will become increasingly blurred
in coming years.

“I don’t think it makes a great deal.

of sense to make those analytical
distinctions,” he said, explaining
that all policy can be considered
domestic at the global level.

Benjamin said he recently wrote a
paper on “The Role of Universities
in Post-Industrial Societies.” He
told his audience, consisting largely
of Pitt students who have studied
abroad or would like to do so, that a
major change is now taking place in
the field of international studies.

“I think my generation was very
naive. I’m a political scientist, and
the fact is that the dominant para-
digms were American—based. The
same was true in economics, in soci-
ology  But now I think there‘s a
revolution occurring in those sub-
jects and elsewhere in the univer-
sity,” he said.

People are learning to reconcep—
tualize the social ‘sciences in a way

that includes understandings and
insights from cultures other than
their own, he said.

“The challenge to you as a student
and to me as an educator is to
develop much more creative learn-
ing skills. We’ve got to begin to oper-
ate with multiple models of human
experience. For example, we’ve got
to learn foreign languages,” Ben-
jamin told the students.

Jack Daniel, Pitt’s new assistant
provost for undergraduate pro-
grams, agreed with Benjamin’s
assessment in a telephone interview
yesterday. “We live in a technologi-
cal, technicolored 20th century.

studies

Society now," he said, “is truly an
international society.

“To be educated for society today
necessarily means having an interna-
tional education. I don’t believe that
an undergraduate can be adequately
educated unless he has some interna-
tional dimension in his education,”
Daniel said.

Daniel cited the accomplishments
of the foreign language departments
of Lincoln University, a predomi-
nantly black institution located
about 45 miles outside of Philadel-
phia. “They try to get every single
person in those majors to spend
some time in the country of that for-
eign language  That’s great.”

In Benjamin»’s meeting with the
SAW group, he, too, emphasized
the value of such travel experiences.
“I would encourage anybody in this
room who can do it to go abroad for
a year.”

When asked whether the new
university-wide planning and reallo-
cation process would place a higher
priority on opportunities for under-
graduates to study abroad, Ben-
jamin said he hoped it would but
could offer no details until the pro-
cess gets further along.

The provost, who came to Pitt
from the University of Minnesota
only last fall, said, “I don’t know
what commitment we have to enable
our students to do that, but I’m sure
that it’s nowhere near enough.”

A relaxed question and answer
session touched on a variety of other
topics related to education and Ben-
jamin spoke openly with the stu-
dents on the problems facing
educators.

He said he was very impressed
with the address delivered Tuesday
at Carnegie-Mellon University by
French President Francois Mitte-
rand and agreed that nations must
begin to share computer technolo-
gies in an increasingly divided
world.

Benjamin added, however, that a
dangerous division between “com-
puter haves and.ha.ve-nots” could
easily develop within countries as
well as between them. He said a pos-
sibility exists in the United States for
the middle class to disappear as we
know it because of a growing trend
toward computer specialization. “A
permanent underclass” of unem-
ployed and underemployed compu-
ter illiterates could be created by
such a trend, he warned.

Another problem Benjamin said
he has faced at Minnesota and at
Pitt is that of new freshmen who
come poorly prepared for the
demands of college-level courses. At
Minnesota, he said, about 60 per-
cent of all undergraduates started in
courses that were very large and
somewhat remedial.

“That‘s ridiculous,” he said. “It’s
no good if we get kids here, white or
black, who are not prepared." Ref-
using to “point the finger” at anyone
specifically, Benjamin said the
nation as a whole must make educa-
tion a higher priority.

The curtain falls on the University
of Pittsburgh Studio Theatre's sea-
son with its final production of Drac-
ula. The show is directed by Henry
Heymann and is based on his own
adaptation of the original book by
Bram Stoker.

The play begins with Johnathan
Harker’s paying a visit to the castle of
Count Dracula. Harker has been sent
by his boss to the castle because the
count has inquired about purchasing
land in England. The so-called terror
begins after Dracula acquires the
land and moves to London. From
there, the play revolves around the
stalking of two young women, one of
which is Harker's wife Mina.

I-Ieymann’s direction is good, and
he worked well within a small space
—- his success partially due to an inge-
nious and mobile set (which he him-
self designed).

His script, however, just doesn't
work. It is not thrilling, and it lacks all
the horrifying aspects that should be
present in a dramatic production of
Dracula. Quite frankly, the play is

very dull and boring. A young girl in
the audience summed up the general
atmosphere when, during the inter-
mission, she turned to a young couple
and said, ”He [Dracula] is funny, and
I'm not at all scared!”
Indeed, the Studio Theatre did take
a chance in performing Heymann’s
adaptation, and although the play
fails to instill fear, he should be com-
mended for an intelligent, well-
written and, though unintentional,
humorous script.
John T. Mumper, who portrayed
Dracula, turned in a nice perfor-
mance despite the unbelievable and
sometimes comical role Heymann
created for him.
As for the two female leads, Cece
Donoghue was more convincing ‘in
her role as Mina Harker than was
Iosephine Fisher in hers of Lucy Wes-
tenra. Fisher wasn't as emotional or
feeling as Donoghue.
A stand-out in the play, with his
convincing accent and fascinating
gestures, was Mark Douglas—]ones,
who was amusing in both of his roles
as Captain Swales and Dr. Abraham
Van Helsing.

No need to run to see Richard Ben-
jamin's new release, Racing with The
Mooncln fact, ‘this could be one race
you may not want to enter.

The film is set"in the fictional coas-
tal town of Point Muir in Northern
California. World War II has entered
its second year, and young men are
summoned to enlist. Moon follows
two high school seniors, Hopper
(Sean Penn) and Nicky (Nicolas
Cage), through their last six weeks
before they must don U.S. .Marine
uniforms.

Rock films through the years have
ranged anywhere from captivating to
regrettable, with an unfortunate
abundance of those that are best off
forgotten. Donn Alan Pennebaker's
Don't Look Back, however, is not merely

Pn srin acng with te Moon.

sumably, scared. However, the movie
does little to make this point.

Hopper and Nicky share a believa-
bly close friendship, which has its ups
and downs. Nicky becomes a second
son to Hopper’s parents (John Karlen
and Rutanya Alda) after his own
mother dies and his father abuses
him. They double-date in the begin-
ning, work at Al's Bowling Alley and
spend many nights chasing down
trains (Somebody has to do it!).

The film wouldn't be " complete
without an adolescent romance,
which happens when Hopper spies
Caddie (Elizabeth McGovern) as a
cashier at a local movie house. Fol-
lowing a few semi-funny encounters,

Dusting off Dylan

one of the first rock documentaries; it
remains one of the most worthwhile,
as well.

Q Filmed during the summer of 1966,
Pennebaker's film captures the enig-
matic aura of a then—rising pop phe-
nomenon, Bob Dylan. Done in black
and white and making frequent use

uéiﬁo qoa

they finally get together after he is
flung around a roller skating rink and
ends up out the door and down a
flight of stairs. Clumsy, but cute.
Hopper takes Caddie to his secret
hiding place, an abandoned, broken-
down tavern in the woods. Still in
tiptop shape is the piano, on which
Hopper plays Caddie a soft tun*e fore-
shadowing the tender romance that
blossoms. '
Meanwhile, Nicky's gotten his girl-
friend Sally (Suzanne Adkinson)
pregnant, and he desperately needs
the money for an abortion. He entan-
gles Hopper in this mess by having
him agree to hustle a few too many
sailors in a not-too-friendly game of

of improper lighting and bad camera
angles, Pennemaker's hand—held 16
millimeter recollection of Dylan's
tour of England is at once realistic and
unrefined.

In the opening scene, Dylan is
shown flipping cue cards which offer
the lyrics to his early classic, "Subter-
ranean Home Sick Blues.” Nervously
turning the cards, he occasionally
checks with someone outside of the
camera's field to make sure that he is
in sync with the music being spliced
onto the soundtrack. This image of a
young Dylan -— unsure, yet totally in
control —— perfectly illustrates his
sometimes contradictory nature and
sets the film off to an engaging start.

Throughout the movie, Don't Look
Back employs a fine balance of inter-
views, concert footage and shots of
Dylan with his close associates.
There is a great deal of focus on him
interacting with the media, whether
it be him reading the papers, listening
to the radio or taking on newspaper
and magazine reporters. In showing
Dylan dealing with the media, partic-
ularly his handling of writers, we see
the young singer as he truly is: con-
frontational and defiant, but always
with an underlying charm about him.

The most outstanding example of
this is an "interview" Dylan holds
with a young reporter before a con-
cert. Restlessly awaiting the show,
Dylan paces the room with his acous-
tic guitar and harmonica. He meets
each of the reporter's questions with
disdaining replies-that keep the jour-
nalist so off-guard that he himself is
soon the one being interrogated. The
sequence ends with Dylan asking the
writer, "What's your purpose in the

pool. This scene is the best in the
movie. The fast-paced music matches
the splendidly edited game of eight-
ball.

The film's premise is good, but the
execution is mediocre. This is sup-
posed to be a traumatic, confusing
time for Hopper and Nicky; they're
preparing to leave the safe confines
of home and enter manhood. How-
ever, the only scene in which some
emotion shines through occurs when
Hopper visits the wounded soldiers in
the hospital and talks with a patient
who lost his leg in the war. But even
here, the emotional level is low.

The actors are not to blame. Penn
(Bad Boys, Fast Times at Ridgemont High),
McGovern (Lovesick, Ordinary People)
and Cage (Rumble Fish, Fast Times at
Ridgemont High) all have exceptional
talent and display it when the film
gives them a chance.

It is the script, the editing and the

dialogue that are far too weak. The

movie doesn't have enough spice, and
the editing makes use of too many
fade-to-black transitions that could
very well have been commerical
breaks.

The film, like the moon, is not
within our reach. Through thick and
thin, friendships, romantic relation-
ships and the loss of innocence are all
commonly shared‘ experiences. But
the film is detached and distant from
the viewers. Nothing is felt for the
characters. Hearts do not pound
fiercely when Hopper and Nicky race
to grab onto the railing of a passing
train; no warmth is felt in Hopper and
Caddie's meant-to-be-tender ro-
mance; and finally, no tears are shed
as Hopper and Nicky grab hold of the
war-bound train to leave the adoles-
cence behind.

Ultimately, Racing With The Moon
has substance, but it lacks the emo-
tional sparkle that makes a good
movie great. ‘ ‘

world?"

The outrageousness of the ques-
tion accurately portrays ‘Dylan as
somewhat reactionary but, all the
while, only half serious. Although
the reporter may believe that his time
has been wasted, Pennebaker knows
better. The scene has splendidly cap-
tured Dylan in all his glory and arro-
gance and is far more telling than any
quote for which the reporter may
have hoped.

As a rock film, Don’! Look Back is
rather light on performances, with
much of the concert footage edited
down to less-than—complete versions
of the songs. However, since most
rock films fail due to an over-reliance
on live material, the approach is
admirable. Likewise, Pennebaker
offers a thoughtful blend of Dylan's
impromptu backstage and hotel room
performances with his British folk~
counterpoint Donavan and his one-
time lover Joan Baez. These sessions
feature somewhat lesser-known

4%:

songs that, again, lend a fine balance ‘W

to the picture.

Although some might complain
that nowhere in the 96 minutes of
Don't Look Back do we gain any mean-
ingful insight into Bob Dylan as a
man or a performer, that would be to
fall into the same trap as Dylan's
victim—interviewer. The fact is that
this artist has, by his own intent,
remained a relative mystery for more
than 20 years.

Only through Bob Dylan's virtual
encyclopedia of recorded music are
we able to form any kind of valid pic-
ture of Bob Dylan. And only by see-
ing D.A. Pennebaker's Don't Look Back
are we able to better understand.

Magnificent
Obsession

I

By RICHARD SATER

Detective John Ferguson suffers
from acrophobia, a fear of heights
resulting in the immobilizing sensa-
tion of dizziness: vertigo. The afflic-
tion leads to his retirement from
police work and into private eyeing.

Gavin Elster, a_ distant acquain-
tance, engages Ferguson to investi-
gate wife Madeleine, whose behavior
lately has been irrational. Ferguson
uncovers her apparent fixation with a
tragic relative and manages to fall
deeply, obsessively into love with

Mrs. Elster — not realizing the dizzy-
ingly, convoluted maze he has
entered.

A promising start for afilm that
makes good on the promise inside
two absorbing hours: Vertigo (1958),

masterfully ‘handled for maximum.

BODY AND SOUL
Joe Jackson
A&M

Trying to comment on Joe
Jackson's artisty is like
expounding upon the imagina-
tion of DaVinci. What can one
possibly say that could do it jus-
tice? And yet there is always the
danger of overintellectualizing
his work. The bottom line ——Joe
Jackson knows how to make
records.

Body and Soul opens with ”The
Verdict," a confessional state-
ment that concisely explains
Jackson's anti—trendiness. "Did
you do me right.7lDid I do right
by you?/When I bared my soul it
seems you did not hear/Can this
be true?/Am I a fool to fight?/I
could do just what you say/But
I'm following my heart/ And
that takes me another way.”

Joe Jackson follows his heart
through an lp that is so musi-
cally and lyrically strong that to
compare it to any other current
popular album would be doing it
a disservice. It's in a class by
itself.

Musically, it is bolder than his
last effort, Night and Day. The
brilliant brass featured on the
opening cut and here and there

RHYME AND REASON
Missing Persons
Capitol EMI

Terry and Dale Bozzio have
proven that their band is not
just a one-album phenomenon.
In this, their second effort (not
counting their debut ep), Dale
perfects her bubbling, burping
voice and throws a little vibrato
into the stew. The little squeak
she emits from time to time (I
guess when she gets caught up
in the emotion of the lyric), has
made it to this record intact.

This might not seem so
important on first inspection,
but if you stop and think of how
many ”new music" bands have
inundated the airwaves in the
last two years providing a

numbing number of same-
sounding, synth—based songs,
Dale Bozzio's little squeak is
about the only thing that sets

Giving More Than
Flesh And Blood

throughout the lp is reminis-
cent ofthe '40s, while the gui-
tar, sax and flugelhorn parts
suggest a more contemporary
jazz feel. Through his resistance
of ”hip-ness,” Jackson creates
his own artistic identity — the
welder of styles.

The pseudo-latin texture of
”Cha Cha Loco” is enough to
send Sergio Mendes on siesta,
and the torment of the heart felt
in the ballad ”Not Here, Not
Now” is balanced nicely by the
poignancy of emotional survival
in "Be My Number Two.” Both
sport fine piano.

Side two begins with an
instrumental overture, ”Loi-
saida,” that reinforces the fact
that Jackson is not only a ’pop'
force to be reckoned with, he is
also a multi-gifted composer
and arranger. The foreboding
tone created by this instrumen-
tal is quickly dispelled by the

sheer romance of ”Happy
Ending."
”It’s no so easy/It's '84

now.../Do I think about the end/
When it's only just the start.7/
...Everybody wants a happy
ending."

The album is lined with a
sense of hope, the desire to
make things work out, regard-

Missing Persons apart.

Dale, of course, is an ex-
Playboy bunny. Maybe it was
she who attracted the famed
fashion photographer Helmut
Newton to do the album cover.
Surprisingly, Dale wears what
seems to be a simple leather
dress with no visible holes.
Newton usually favors more
bizzare, explicitly sexual clo-
thing on his models, like the
rubber tubing or Styrofoam
outfits Dale has designed for
herself on previous outings.

This one makes an unabashed
bid for dance-floor success.
Where their first record was
guitar-oriented rock, this one is
much more an excursion for
keyboards and bass. What they
do is best exemplified by the sin-
gle ”Give," which sets up an
irresistible groove with the
aforementioned instruments

and fleshes it out with a nasty ~

Three of the five band
members play keyboards at any
given time, making the result
sometimes like a frantic exercise
in minimalism a la Phillip Glass
(”Racing Against Time") or,
perhaps, the Archies let loose in
the Casio age (”Right Now").
The lyrics, written on the
jacket for convenience, contain
few pearls of wisdom. Missing
Persons sing about come-ons
and not holding back. One
exception, ’’All Fall Down," is
about the insanity of geopoli-
tics. Some good lines can be
found in ”Racing Against
Time": ”Everything's a threat/
Feeling something wet/Who
said it was no sweat..." and ”It’s
like I'm ‘living in a situation
comedy/They've got me social-

powers it

izing with these absent
entities.”

All in all, this is a dispensable
-—— albeit pleasant — record.

Their songwriting won't set the
world on fire, but the groove
may do it for your feet. And
then there's the squeak.

Poof! (again) The artists head
pivots to the left and finds a
pint-sized imp in red. The little
demon jabs him in the neck.
”Don’t listen to that idiot, Lou.
Go ahead. Do another live
album. What could it hurt?"

Why this record was made,
especially with a studio lp due
out this summer, is anybody’s
guess (economics, anyone.7).

Behold. Yet another live col-
lection from Lou Reed, Live In
Italy. Absolutely nothing new
here, nothing that hasn't been
done (and re-done) before.

A lengthy two record set feat-
uring Reed standards, as well as
selections from his last lp's, The
Blue Mask and Legendary Hearts.
Should be enough to send the
world out for coffee, right?
Wrong. This set is more on the
line of hitting you up for a dona-
tion to the ”Why I Love Lou
Reed" Fund.

I'll admit it. I could listen to
”Sweet Jane” until my grand-
children hide it from me, and
"Walk On The Wild Side" still
makes its statement in the
aerobicized-eighties. But this is
not what saves the album from
the chopping block. There is a
no—nonsense, grit-your-teeth-
and-play attitude to this collec-
tion that is its salvation.

Reed sounds collected, organ-
ized and self—controlled this
time around. It is no lie that the
vehemence and quirky brash-
ness of Rock and Roll Animal, Lou
Reed Live and Take No Prisoners,
were the established trade-
marks of the artist. But Lou is
no longer the punchy kid he was
them. Surpassing 40 is a miles-

pull its own plug. What has hap-
pened is that it has more or less
regulated itself.

Naturally, much of the
urgency and plaintiveness of
the work has succumbed to the
years, but Reed once again
proves that he is still his own
best interpreter. ”White Light/
White Heat” still sizzles as it did
for The Velvet Underground
well over a decade ago, this time
driven by the guitar prowess of
Robert Quine. ”Average Guy”
and ”Waves of Fear” from The
Blue Mask are pleasant surprises
and welcomed entries to the
pantheon of Lou Reed live cuts.

is what Reed does best, and here

WORKING WITH FIRE AND
STEEL

China Crisis

Virginlwarner

Is there redemption after
Seven Treasure Chicken?
According to China Crisis, the
answer isn't so simple as yes or
no, but it sure does sound good
on the band's stateside debut.

The key to this Brit band's
sound lies in Oriental chic. By
combining good-mannered’
English synth—pop with beauti-
ful and fashionable Ming Dy-
nasty melodies and throwing in
some angst-ridden lyric for

artsiness sake, China Crisis has

arrived at its sound — sweet and
sour pop that is light a_nd palata-
ble and instills a craving for
more the next day.

Carry Daly and Eddie Lundon
form Crisis’ nucleus and share
the song-
duties. The imag»erjy they pro-
duce with their songs meshes

, aptly with the group's moniker:

a mystical land steeped in tradi-
tion, yet marred by the ignor-
ance of modernism. Of course,
this whole idea is hard to take
seriously when it's coming from
two guys who live in Liverpool,
England, but, overall, they pull
itoff, especially with the help of
the Breck Road String Ensemble
and flutist Gary Barnacle, who
help to provide some great
Asian mood music.

Side one opens strongly with
the ambiguously political
”Working» With Fire and Steel,”

and ‘lyric-writing ‘

/ an CHINA CRISIS

the band's first U.S. single,
which assimilates communism
with fashion. ”When The Piper
Calls‘? sports a great guitar hook
and has the boys sounding like
an upbeat Tears for ‘Fears.
”Hanna, Hanna” and "Animals
‘In Jungles” use sharks and rat-
tlesnakes as metaphors for the
slimier members of the human
rat race while employing
syntho-tribal backbeats to
power the songs.

Side two, the superior side, is
much more melodic. It begins
with the album's best tune,
”Wishful Thinking,” which
combines a sweet soaring
synthesizer with the lyrics
about a man who finds that his
lover has found another and
painfully begins to compare

in»

IIlr%X*3ll¢” IIIC

  

himself to his rival, ”Tragedy
and Mystery" follows with a
weaving flugelhorn and a funky
bassline that chases the‘ vocal
through the chorus. ”Papua”
continues the triple threatwith
sad melody and lyrics that eul-
ogize the South Pacific soldier.

Actually, there's no artistic
groundbreaking on Working
With Fire And Steel, it's just a
clever blend of the old and the
new that makes for great listen-
ing and occasional thinking.
Daly and Lundon have hit upon
an irresistible medium of pop
music, and as long as they don't
take themselves too seriously,
they've got a good thing going.
If only China Crisis came in lit-
tle white carry-out boxes.

Krause arme
with potentia
after injury
rehabilitation

By Scott Dellett
The Pitt News

A pitcher’s success depends on the condition of
his arm. If he treats it well, the benefits —— 90 mph
fastballs, sharp-breaking curves, strikeouts and
wins —— remain in his arsenal. If he abuses the gift,
the pitcher is left with nothing but pain.

i Three summers ago, Pitt pitcher Aaron Krause
unleashed a fastball in the sixth inning ofa game in
the eight-team Cape Cod League, which contains
the best collegiate players in the country. Three
days before, the righthander threw 170 pitches in a
12-inning contest.

As the pitch crossed the plate, a grimacing look
crossed his face. Something popped in his elbow.

“The injury didn’t occur during that game, it
happened because of it," he said. —

The pain persisted throughout Pitt’s fall prac-
tice, intensifying as the team entered its spring tour
to Florida. Krause, then a sophomore, attempted
to throw, and promptly succumbed to the throb-
bing in his elbow after three innings.

Surgery was necessary. For a pitcher, an opera-
tion could be the tombstone of a possible profes-
sional career. As Pitt coach Bobby Lewis put it,
“Anytime you do surgery on a pitcher's arm, it’s
serious.” »

Krause has recovered from a crushed nerve in his
right elbow and a sometimes-frustrating rehabili-
tion period. He is showing the form of his freshma
year, in which he was 7-0. ‘

In the recent five-game swing in Florida, the 6-4,
l9l lb. junior completed both starts, as he com'-
piled a 1-l record and a 2.55 earned run average.
Against Florida A&M, Krause did not allow an
earned run while ‘striking out 12.

“In Florida, he was popping the ball like his
freshman year," Lewis said. “His control and
mechanics looked the same.” A

During the tour, Krause rediscovered his rising
fastball, a pitch that batters fear.

“I was throwing hard and the catcher said the
ball was rising more than usual,” Krause said.

In I982, painless pitching was his goal. Even
though Krause had the ability to pitch effectively,
the arm was hurting. ,

The early prognosis was tendonitis, a condition
which requires rest. That did not bring any relief.
Neither did treatments with ultrasound, whirl- »
pools or ice packs.

Krause's savior was team physician Dr. Richard
Ray, who performed the surgery in April, 1982.
“Dr. Ray suggested to scrape scar tissue away from
theelbow,” Krause said.

There Ray found the cause of Krause’s pain — a
damaged nerve.

The most difficult part of any operation is the
ensuing rehabilitation period. The hours and hours
of repetitive exercises can frustrate even the most
dedicated athletes.

What bothered Krause the most was trying to
watch his teammates perform. This was-a squad
which lost its starting pitching staff, two of whom
— Alan Lachowicz and Larry Lamonde —
bypassed their senior year for the professional
ranks. F

“It was frustrating to watch them, not being able
to play,” he said. “I hardly went to the games. After
all, I've been playing since I was eight years old and
I never had an arm problem."

It was equally as hard for Lewis, who had to
mold a staff made of freshmen. The result was an
ll-l9 record, just one year after the Panthers

Bill Fralic is looking forward to
playing football once more on the
familiar field at Penn Hills High
School.

The University of Pittsburgh foot-
ball team is holding its second
annual benefit spring game at Penn
Hills High School Stadium on
Thursday night, April 12, and Fral-
ic’s high school jersey — No. 79 -
will be retired at halftime
ceremonies.

Fralic will also receive his Kodak
All-America award at halftime.
Kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m.

“It’ll be nice to go back and play
there,” said Fralic, following a
weight-lifting workout at Pitt Sta-

1 dium during spring drills. “I haven’t

played there in four years. The
whole game is for charity, and a lot
of my friends will be there. It’s nice
to be able to do something for your
community like that.”

Proceeds from the benefit game,
which is being sponsored by the
Greensburg Tribune- Review, will go
to Camp Shining Arrow, a summer
camp in Penn Hills that provides
programs for physically and men-
tally handicapped youngsters in the
eastern suburbs of Pittsburgh.

“This is the sort of community
involvement and identity we’re striv-
ing for,” said Pitt head football
coach Foge Fazio. “And it’ll be a big
night for Billy and his family and a
lot of our fans.”

A crowd of over 6,000 is expected
to attend the game, which is a thrill

who coached Fralic as well as grad-
uated free safety_Tom Flynn when
Urbanic was the head coach at Penn

Urbanic helped organize this
benefit game and has been its biggest
booster.

It‘s also a special treat for Tom
Johnson, a senior from Penn Hills
who has a shot at starting at tight
end for the Panthers, but Bob Bucz-
kowski, a junior from neighboring
Monroeville who was a great one at
Gateway High School before pick-

“I look at the game as part of prac-
tice. To me, every part of spring ball
is work. It’s about as exciting as our
summer football camp, but it's
necessary. I know that [it is] if we’re
going to be at our best in the fall.

‘‘I’m excited about our schedule
this season. We have a chance to
have a great team and the oppor-
tunity to prove it to everybody
around the country. If we win with
this schedule, we’ll all get national
recognition.”

The Panthers have a six-game
home schedule at Pitt Stadium,
highlighted by the visits of Brigham
Young, Oklahoma, West Virginia
and Navy,. with Napoleon McCal-
lum, the nation's No. l rusher.

The toughest game on the sched-
ule could be an Oct. 20 road date
with the defending national cham-
pion Miami team at the Orange
Bowl. ,

“lt’s the sort of schedule,” said
Fralic, “ a top football team wants to
play. I’m looking forward to it.”

Penn Hills High School are $2 for
adults, $1 for children. For ticket

some may remember, donned Wolverines capture NIT title
Panther blue and gold before Coach ‘

Roy Chipman lifted his scholarship  The Michigan Wolverines easily defeated the Fighting Irish of
last year,  Notre Dame 83-63 at Madison Square Garden Wednesday night.

Mary Daigle, music and assistant
sports director, claims that the
PGH-ers have only to “show up" in
order to topple The Pitt News
squad.

The Pitt News is talking, too. “I
think PGH is in trouble. The Pitt
News has about a dozen players, and
I don’t think PGH is used to that big

. of an audience," offered Joe Zeff,
features editor.

Michigan was lead by 6-1 I sophomore Tim McCormick’s 28 points
_ and I4 caroms. McCormick was voted the tourney’s MVP.
,/i Also leading the Wolverines to victory was the 18 point effort by

6-10 sophomore Roy Tarpley.

/ Top scorers for the Irish in a losing cause were Tom Sluby and Tim
Kempton with I9 points each, and Ken Barlow chipped in 18.

Bob Green, the 6-4, 220 lb. Pitt
News Scoreboard Machine, aims to
knock around a few announcers

0 tomorrow afternoon. “This is my
first year playing for The Pitt News
and already I hate PGH. I want
blood — Lakes of it, dammit!”

“We are gonna grind those disc
jockeys into the court,” threatened
the 5-7, I35 lb. stalwart Michael
Weinman. “We’re gonna give the
court a high-gloss shammy with
their heads. They’re gonna be spin-
ning around faster than those
records they play. Its a good thing
that WPGH doesn‘t broadcast. At
least no one will have to listen to

. their crying Monday morning.”

But on a more serious note, the
game will offer a I5-deep Pitt News
roster. WPGH will be understaffed,
staying with its ironclad starting
quintet. But off the bench, WPGH
General Manager K.J. Jones is
expected to see action.

“We’Il use K.J. Jones off the
bench in the same fashion that the
Lakers used Norm Nixon 21 year ago
—— and with the same results,” Pro-
gramming Director Chris Kramer
said.

3, WPGH staffer Tom Walsh
believes that his team’s front line of
Lake and Steel Valley’s Roy Hoza
will be too overpowering for the
Newsers.

“Our twin towers could eat up
Ewing and Sampson," Walsh said.

But can they eat up Green and
graphic designer Norman Kerr at
Trees Hall? The question will be ans-
wered soon enough.

Krause returns to form

continued from page nineteen

“The big thing was Aaron had to
be patient," Lewis said.

Besides the physical aspects of
recovery, Krause had to worry

‘ about regaining the mechanics that

made him a successful pitcher.
“After the surgery, I had to con-
centrate on getting back on track,”

A Krause ‘said.

Last year, Krause claimed the role
of the Panther stopper, winning four
games and completing five, both
tops on the team. The velocity and
the endurance were missing, but
Krause was effective.

Even in his return to Cape Cod
last summer, Krause was not the
same pitcher who went 7-3 on a team
which finished third in the league in
1981. Krause went 3-7 for an inexpe-
rienced squad.

“I wasn’t on the top of my game,”
he said. “I didn’t do as well as my
first summer, but I wasn’t . too
displeased.”

Now that he is back in form,
Krause’s concerns are turned to this
season. The professional scouts are
keeping close vigil on the college
campus, their eyes seeking lively
arms. A good performance in 1984
could mean a professional contract
for Krause come June.

“I’d like to play professional base-
ball,” he said. “This is my fourth
year, and I’m a couple credits short
of my degree. There is ample time to
get it, and I’m willing to take that
chance.”

Krause wasn’t going to risk any-
thing out of high school. His older
brother, Lew,‘ passed up a football
scholarship to Pitt, instead signing
with the Pirates. After several years
in the minors, the elder Krause was
released. ‘

“Aaron realized that the best way
was to go with Plan A and Plan B,”
Lewis said. “That way, if something
was to happen, he would always
have the degree.” '

“Baseball is a real business,"
Krause said. “I’d like to get a nice
sum of money. My decision will
depend on how high I’m drafted and
how much money is offered.

“In high school, there was a lot of
stipulations. Now, it’s a little less.”

His college choice was not any
easier. Krause had the opportunity
to play for Clemson or Ohio State.
Instead, he chose the familiarity of
Pitt.

“The college level is also a busi-
ness,” he said. “Ohio State was offer-
ing a four-year scholarship, and
there isn’t such a thing. I knew Pitt"
and Clemson were there.

“Bobby Lewis was honest with

me. He said I would play and start  ‘

and become one of the leaders of the
team. I have a lot of respect for the
man.

“A lot of people asked why I
didn’t go south. If you are good
enough, scouts will find you no mat-
ter were you are.”

Scouts may blink when they
watch Krause this season. It could
be a vision of the past. Both Lacho-

wicz, a first-round choice of Texas in . A
I981, and Krause have a similar I

motion. Both are nearly the same
size.

“If you look at Aaron from a dis-
tance, you couldn’t tell the differ-
ence from Alan Lachowicz," Lewis
said.

“A couple of times my father
didn’t know if it was Alan or me on

. the mound,” Krause said.

Lachowicz was a positive influ-
ence on the young freshman out of
Allderdice in Pittsburgh.

“I tried to compete with him," .
Krause said. “If he won a game, I felt '

like keeping the winning attitude up
by winning.”

He would like to follow Lacho-
wicz into the professional ranks.
Meeting Dr. Ray is a different story,
however. _

“No offense, but I like to stay as
far away from him as possible."

Pittsburgh
Ballet
Theatre
presents

‘La Fille’

The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre will
bring its 1983-84 season to a close
this weekend when it presents “La
Fille Mal Gardee” and a world pre-
mier New Ballet at Heinz Hall.

“La Fille Mal Gardee” is a classic
French ballet which is filled with
pantomime and lively dancing. First
performed in 1789, “La Fille" has
been popular for over 250 years and
is still considered to be one of the
best in the classical repertoire.

“La Fille Mal Gardee,” which
means “the unchaperoned girl," is a
delightfully lighthearted story of
lovers kept apart. Set in a small
mountain village, the comical story
of our lovers unfolds. Lisette and
Colon are in love, but Lisette’s dom-
ineering mother has plans for
Lisette’s marriage to a wealthy vine-
growers’s son. Colon’s persistent
love for Lisette gets him in trouble
with Lisette’s determined mother,
and a timeless comedy overflowing
with laughter follows.

“La Fille” will be presented
March 30 and 31 at 8 p.m. and on
April 1 at 2 p.m. The role of Lisette
will be shared by the Pittsburgh
Ballet Theatre's principal female
dancers, Mireille Leterrier and Eve-
lyne Desutter. Leterrier will dance
on Friday and Sunday, accompan-
ied by Pittsburgh‘s own Kenneth
Nickel. Nickel will be dancing the
part of Colon in these two shows,
and will watch the PBT’s newest
principal dancer, Vasile Petrutiv, as
Colon on Saturday.

Petrutiv will be performing his
second ballet in Pittsburgh when he
dances alongside Desutter this
weekend. Petrutiv was a Romanian
dancer until two years ago, when he
defected to the West. Petrutiv came
to Pittsburgh in February, and has
become the company's much needed
second male principal.

The New Ballet, which is not yet
titled, is by the renowned dancer and
choreographer Jean-Pierre Bonne-
fous. This new piece is set to the
music of Shubert‘s Symphony No. 2.
This new work is the second that
Bonnefous has brought to Pitts-
burgh. The PBT performed the
ballet “Three Overtures” earlier this
season and met with successful
reviews after it was performed.

Tickets for “La Fille” and the New
Ballet can be purchased at prices
that range from $4 to $24. Discount
tickets can be purchased by all full-
time students at the Pitt Ticket
Office. Tickets can also be pur-
chased by phoning 281-0360 or stop-
ping by the Heinz Hall box office.
