Players Return
To Foster Stage .

Tomorrow Night  

Pitt Players’ and their hit show ‘‘All My Sons” are coming back
to the Foster stage for an unprecedented return engagement tomor-

row night.
Tremendous popular demand

for tickets during last week’s

three-day run prompted scheduling of the extra performance.
“We’re putting it on again,” said Business Manager Harry Har-
ris, “so that those who were unable to see it the ﬁrst three nights

will have another opportunity.” 0

Price of tickets remains pegged
at $1. They are now on sale at
the Student Desk on the ground
ﬂoor.

Veterans of many Player pro-_
ductions rank the current offer-
ing as one of the ﬁnest perform-
ances in the dramatic group’s long

history. ,
Variously described as “pow-
erful” and “moving,” “All My

Sons” deals with the story of a
war proﬁteer father and his vet-
eran sons.

Bill Aul, Player mainstay for
the past two years, turns in his
most polished job of acting as the
beleaguered father. He receives
able‘ support from Josephine Bos-
coe, Mel Silver and Angela Gial-
lombardo. ‘ A

The play was the artistic tri-
umph of the 1947 Broadway sea-_
son. It was chosen by the New
York critics for their annual Dra-
matic Circle Award.

Conditions Dissatisfy
Track Team Members

_ By Myron Kopelman

Fighting in Pitt’s athletic war broke out on .a second front this
week, as two track stars quit the squad and a host of others expressed
dissatisfaction with present track conditionsand coaching.

Ed Sudzina, the story book athlete who overcame spinal menin-_
gitis at sixteen to become Pitt’s crack distance runner, dropped off
the squad along with John Wilson, half and quarter miler.

Sudzina quit because he could no longer “run, study, and work
at the same time.” Wilson’s explanation was that his class schedule
conﬂicted with track drills.

“The going is too rough,” said thestocky Sudzina. “I can’t sweep
steps for three hours and get all that dust in my lungs, and then
go out and run three or four miles everyday. On top of that, I
have to commute everyday from my home (Duquesne, Pa.).”

»Wilson, who is a pre-dental student from Philadelphia, said

from Act 1.

Traditional Easter
Services at Chapel

Special Easter services will be held at Heinz Chapel tomorrow
and Easter Sundayain accordance with University tradition. "

Tomorrow’s services will be held at 12.145 p. m. for the student
body. The guest speaker will be Reverend Merle. Read Swihart,
rector of First Presbyterian Church of Glenshaw. Reverend Swihart’s
"topic will be “What Is the Real Joy?” The choir, led by Dr. Theo-
dore M. Finney, head of the music ‘department, will sing.

There will be a special service for evening students. The speaker
for the service will be Dr. W. V. Parsons, pastor of the Brighton Road
Presbyterian- Church, who will discuss “Religion—-A Conventional
Form of Vital Force.” The service will begin at 7:20 p. m. with the
choir’s processional.

Sunday evening Vespers, held since the chapel’s opening in 1938,

will have special Easter signiﬁcance. Dr. Stillman Allen Foster,
opastor, of the Tlrird Presbyterian

at Trees Gym,” said one, “results
in a great many injured knees,
and the damp walls of the field-
house produce colds.

“The outdoor track at the Sta-
dium,” he concluded, “is always
in poor shape, and when the Civic
Opera comes along in May, we get
thrown out of there, anyhow.”

(University officials have been
working on‘ a plan for construc-
tion of new track facilities.)

Coach Carl Olson also came in
for a generous share of biting crit-
icism from team members. He was
called to task on the following
charges: _ —

1-—That he is too seldom pres-
ent at track practice.

2-——That he does not bring out
the best in the young runners
by thorough instruction of tech-
nicalities.

.3—-That he does not provide
the squad members with ade-
quate meals on trips.

4-—That he too frequently in-
dlllges in tongue lashing of
trackmen.

5—That he has overworked
some runners, “squeezing them
out like a sponge,”

When reached for _comment, Ol-
son dismissed the accusations in
rapid fashion. “This meal business
is Simply not so,” he replied em-
phatically. “I have insisted at all
times that the boys be very well
fed.

To Defend Crown

Four members of Men’s Debate will battle verbally this
weekend to retain the championship won in last year’s Grand

, National Forensic Tournament. Only Dave Rhodes will put in

a repeat appearance in the ﬁght to keep the ﬁrst. place cup at
Pitt for another year. ‘ _
The tournament runs from Thursday to Saturday.

Vespers will be joined by the
alumni choir when they offer
“The Passion Trilogy.” This
trilogy of Ukrainian Folk Songs
was arranged by Alexander
Koshetz. The trilogy includes

“.Tria1 Before. Pilate,” “Crucifix-
ion” and “Resurrection.”

Rhodes and Bob Dickey are negative and Harry Green and‘
Frank Blackstone are affirmative“

of the resolution: “That Federal

World Government Should Be
Established.” '

Debaters leave tomorrow morn-
ing for Mary Washington College
in Fredericksburg, Va., also the
site of last year’s Grand National.
Enroute, the four aspirants will
pause at Annapolis long enough
to bandy a few words with the
midshipmen by way of debate to-
morrow night.

Dave Rhodes, Tom Skiiﬁngton,
Dick Hazley and Jack Gilbert
made up the Pitt team which
brought a national debate cham-
pionship to campus. In competi-
tio,n, Hazley and Gilbert won
eight out of eight debates and
Rhodes and Skifiington earned
seven wins in eight starts.

This afternoon they venture to
Washington, Pa., for a meet with
the Little Presidents of Washing-
ton and Jefferson. Tonightfs trip
to Latrobe, Pa., where they will
challenge St. Vincent’s College,
rounds out an intensive training
program.

 

Social Rues
an Liquor

Use of alcoholic beverages at af-
fairs sponsored by the University

‘or campus organizations is strict-

ly prohibited and subject to ﬁne
and social probation the Social
Committee of Student Congress
reemphasized recently.

The committee statement fur-
ther rules that no complimentary

tickets shall be issued at any
event and that no affair can be

scheduled which conﬂicts. with
University events.
These revisions, the ﬁrst

changes in social rules since 1940,
will appear in a new booklet.

Reemphasizing another past
rule, the committee states that
social chairmen must register af-
fairs at least four days before the
event. The statement also ex-
plains the payment of Federal and
city amusement taxes.

Rose Group
Reports Soon

Chairman Floyd Rose of the
trustee’s committee investigating
the athletic muddle here, an-
nounced that he expects to have
a report prepared by the end of

' the month.

Mr. Rose, who is with the Firth-
Sterling Steel Company, offered
business committments as the ex-
cuse for the delay thus far.

“I’ve been out of town repeat-
edly these ‘past two weeks and
have had to neglect the report,”
he said.

“After all, it’s tough getting
ﬁve businessmen together,” he
continued. Rose emphasized that
he and the remainder of the com-
mittee have their businesses ﬁrst,
‘‘I’m working for the Firth-Ster-
ling Company and not the Uni-
versity.”

Three meetings have been held
so far according to Rose. He said
that there were still a few minor
details to be ironed out.

He emphasized that under no
circumstances would an incom-
plete report be submitted to the
trustees.

Star debaters under the direction of Fred Robie leave tomorrow for Fredricksburg, Va., to
compete in the Grand National Forensic Tournament. Standing (left to right) Bob Dickey, Franklin

Blackstone, and Dave Rhodes; sitting: Harry Green and director Fred Robie.

  NEXT MOV E

. Inevitably, during the course of-a year, pub-
lications and student government get into one
ﬁrst class row. Such occurred last week when
IF Council threw a verbal grenade at T. A.
Perkinson, editor of the Panther.

The fraternity governing group, it ‘seems,

is disgusted with T. A.’s innovation, Alpha
iSigma Sigma, a feature devoted to slinging
briekbats. They are particularly moved by the
fact that John “Doc” Ferguson was placed on

its membership roll. _ P

, ‘Also, on the objectionable list were the
names of Harry DeBee, lordly elevator dis-
patcher, and a few men from fraternity ranks.
IF feels that Perkinson should be reined in.
‘( Beyond question, IF Counciltis within its
rights in,i'ts denunciation of Perkinson’s edi-
torial policy. They are within their rights to
ask for an apology to the persons involved.
Likewise,‘ to the tenets of journalistic. ethics,
Perkinson is within his rights to do as he
pleases. He may apologize, quietly retract,
' take issue with Council, or suggest residence

 

. -in a warmer place for the protestees.

_ IF Council, unfortunately for its cause,
I gives recognition to Alpha Sigma Sigma in its
letter of denunciation. Also, in its grandiose
. gesture they seem to take just as much offense
to the slam at the frat brothers as they do to
the dig at “Fergie.” ‘ /
‘Whatever the real purpose of the Greeks’
.ire, and whatever its outcome, the entire aﬁair
amounts to little more than a slight wind storm
in a teapot. ~ . ’

Mom: POWEIl-

While Student Congress is doing a bit of
spring" cleaning on its by-laws, the editorial
staff of the News would like to air an issue
that has long been a favorite of this depart-
ment. ~Student Congress needs strength to gov-
.ern student affairs at ‘Pitt.

For quite a while the word “lethargic” has
crept into print -whenever a report was made
of Congress" activities. This “lethargy” is not

’ duelto actual lack of initiative on the part of
Congress members but rather an inability to
"accomplish things desired. a

VVith more power by actual law, with an
active desire to administer to student needs,
the Student Congress of the University will be
able to accomplish much. l -

All this hinges on the way they do the clean-

‘, ing job. If it is complete, Pitt will have more

than a mere social committee for its Student
Congress. 1

I Of course there are limitations. No person
in a responsible group on campus can justly
"advocate complete autonomy for Congress.‘ But,
,the .present constitution is actually leaning
over backwards toward use of power.

Congress should.have the right to ask for
much more than reports from the various cani-
pus organizations. It should, actually, have
power to call inquiries andhearings if actions
warrant in. any case of poor management in

. any campus group. It is far better to see this
power in the hands of the students whom it
affects than in the hands of the administration.

If the University is to teach citizenship, if
it is to live up to the principle of democracy,
let the students handle, punitively,.their own
aﬁairs. Politics “will undoubtedly come into
the foreground; but, why not? If yve are to be
‘educated for democracy, we must be educated
for polities. ‘

Varies With

 Scope of Activity

By Bl” Veenls
There are many ways of putting editorial policy
to work. The chief way, of course, is through the
editorial columns. The next, and most effective
way, is through news story slanting. But, there is
another way. . 4
Tomorrow evening, Pitt Players exhibits its
.- last performance of “All My Sons” to campus
patrons. Today's edition of the News carries a"
full, length feature on the show. Friday, we
went all out to give. Players what, we thought
was their just due in the way of publicity.
The same is true‘ of last Tuesday.‘ «

“All My Sons” is that kind of a production.
For our money, it deservesall the space we can
give it. Not being a true theatre critic, I cannot
vouch for‘ the technical accomplishments of the
Players crew. One thing 1.. do know: Players have
produced a top ﬂight two hours of entertainment.‘
It is well worth the time and money spent. We feel
that our editorial‘ policy is correct in this case.

Many readers will feel that the News has
given too much publicity to one campus or-
ganization in its dealings with Players during
the past year.'They are justiﬁed in question-
ing. our policy. But we do have a. reason.

The production “All My Sons” involved. the
work of some ﬁfty old persons, working steadily,
ﬁve nights a week for ﬁve weeks, at approximately
ﬁve hours ‘per night. Count it up. That’s about 6,250
man hours of volunteer energy placed at the dis-
posal of the campus layman when he watches the
play. A lot of time. No other campusorganization,
save the Owl and , the News, requires that much
time for fulﬁllment of their goals. Certainly, no
dances committee ever placed that much energy
in its affair. v

Players is justiﬁed in receiving the publicity
for “All My Sons” because of the work they put
into it to make it a real success. ’

The ﬁrst statement is complete-
ly false. It was not a “successful
attempt.” The Sun lpst 36,427 in
circulation last December during
the experiment. The Times lost
31.027. The Daily News -admitted
to a loss’ (not ABC ﬁgures) of
34,605. The Tribune admitted a
loss of 40—50,000 (and estimates
have been made of as high as
100,000). The Her-ald—A,merican, a
Hearst paper whose less-copy,
more—pix policy suffers least from
photoreproduction, claimeda gain
of 12,000 over the same month
of the previous year, but offers.
no pre-strike and strike ﬁgures
for comparison. ‘

There is a time lag of from two-
and-a-half hours to four hours
between the writing of copy and
its appearance on the street, com-
pared to 20 minutes for a hot
story under normal conditions.
.Little news has appeared less than
12 hours old, as a matter of fact;
a story breaking after 10 P. M.
will not make ﬁrst morning edi-
tions. Most news is running from
24 to 48 hours old.

Artistically, typed copy for re-
production is an abomination, as
compared of typed" and printed
copy will prove. For the sake of
readability, large amounts of
white space are being used around
all copy, leading to "an incredible
waste of paper. - '

And this is called a “success-
ful attempt.”

As for his second claim, ,_I will
briefly refer to an article on mod-
ern printing developments which
appeared in the February Car-
negie Technical, which was on
sale at the student desk recently.
That present processes will be
discarded in favor _of direct typ-
ing and photograph is not an im-
mediate prospect.

Why were these statements
made? I fancy it was just one
more in a series of similar stories
in a sporadic propaganda cam-
paign being waged by publishers
against the printing trades‘.

If there were a variety of groups

a part of that democracy, and stu-
dents would become conscious of

I‘. A. Amazed,
Amused by IF
Action on ASS

Reactions to the strong protest
of IF council against the Alpha

Sigma Sigma feature of the Pan-
ther were many and varied.

T. A. Perkinson, magazine edi-
tor, was both surprised and
amused at the hullaballoo caus-

_ ed by the IF Council’s action. He

refused to make any comment on
the report.

He said that he had received
no notice from.lF Council as to
any action on their part. Stuart
Workmaster, Panther publicity_di-
rector, remarked that he thought
it was only a political publicity
stunt by the fraternities.

Harry De Bee, genial elevator

' dispatcher who was listed in the

ASS, stated in an interview with
a News reporter that he felt the
Panther had gone too far.

In his opinion an attack on him
personally was out of order. “I’m
just here to «do a job,” he said,
“and I cannot see why that mag-
azine has to make a direct attack
on me. I don’t even know Perkin-
son.”

Two members of the Panther
staff used the adverse publicity
to sell the huge pile of previously
unsold magazines. They set up
shop near the ground ﬂoor activi-
ties booth holding before them a
copy of the front page of Friday’s
News.

J.‘ J. GREANY

BECOMES

IF SOCIAL CHAIRMAN

Jim Greany
Replaces Steinlauf

Due to the Easter vacation
and a previously announced
plan of the publications board
to eliminate one issue of the
Pitt News per month, the News.
will be absent from University
news stands until April 1.

Dean Biddle lnviles Everyone
To ‘Come Up and See Me‘

“Come and cut up with us at our Red-Tape cutting party,” T. W.
Biddle, dean of men, cries as he announces to all students and offi-
cials of the University that after 16 years in an unplastered oiﬁce he

James “J. J.” Greany, senior
representative to IF Council, will
ﬁll the position of chairman of
IF Social Committee left vacant
by the recent resignation of Paul
Steinlauf.

Steinlauf’s resignation is re-
ported to have stemmed from dis-
agreements with the IF Execu-
tive Committee over the coming
IF dance. _

Steinlauf advocated a 70 per
cent attendance quota for each
fraternity—a ﬁgure considered too
high by the exec-utive commit-
tee. His proposals for a Mas-
querade"Ball were squelched by
the committee’s lack of enthusi-
asm, as was his suggestion that
the dance be a “sport’s attire” af-
fair.

As social chairman, Steinlauf
led the planning for such social
ﬁascos as the Penn State bon-
ﬁre rally and last semester’s
Hatchet Hop.

‘His successor, Jim Greany, has
been serving as a member of
Steinlauf’s Social Committee and
as social chairman of Delta Tau
Delta fraternity. He advocates
“something new” in Pitt social
life--“a dance where you can
dance.”

The fraternity attendance quota
has been set at 50 per cent.

. can show off his new dwelling, seven assistants, and “1O lovely sec-I ditiong,

retaries,” this afternoon from 3:309

to 5 p. m.

Formal invitations, edged with
‘a small ribbon of red tape, have
been mailed to heads of all the
"campus organizations that work
out of the office of the dean of
men, but all other students and
faculty are invited.

The dean’s office isn’t formal
enough to ‘cut the tape’ to their
new oﬂice, so they decided to “cut
the red-tape” and make the get-
together as informal as a dean’s
office can be. The tape will stretch
across the entrance and will be cut
promptly at 3:30. George Lynn,
president of Student Congress,
and Gene Thres_her, president of
Men’s Council, will assist in the
actual cutting.

“And everybody is invited to
come to the grand opening,” states
Mr. J. Edward Ricart, chairman
of the event.

There will be no program. The
dean’s guests will just roam about
the freshly redecorated ofﬁce and
admire the newly refurnished of-
ﬁes.

1949 Spring Festival will be ac-
cepted until April I in the of-
ﬁce of the dean of men, Janet
Neesham, chairman of the ap-
pointments committee announc-
ed last Wednesday.

After considerable debate, the
new motion to appoint the Spring
Festival committee on Tap Day
was ﬁnally passed. A deadlock
was broken when George Lynn,
president, cast his reserve vote.
’ Janet Neesham, vice-president,
asked for reassurance that she
would not be left holding the bag
if anything went wrong under the
new plan. She was reassured, and
the measure was passed.

Final results of the interviews
and the persons selected for the
positions will be announced on

Assistant pastor at St. Paul’s Cathedral since his graduation
from St. Vincent’s Seminary in Latrobe, Father O’Rourke is eager

to carry his work over into the college ﬁeld.

When asked‘ how he rates col—"‘.

legians in comparison to students
he teaches :at Cathedral High
School, he explained that he ﬁnds
them .“more aware of their place
in the world.”

Father O’Rourke further said
that he enjoys working with all
young people, because he ﬁnds
them so susceptible to teaching.
“And besides,” he added, “it helps
keep me young.”_ .

Since December, when his ap-
pointment was made, Father
O’Rourke has spent a great deal
of his time rejuvenating the New-
man Club, an organization com-
posed of Catholic men and women

from all Pittsburgh colleges.

He directs the Newman Clubs
on the Pitt, Tech, and PCW cam-
puses. He himself is an honorary
“member of the Pitt chapter of Phi

" Kappa, social fraternity for Cath-
olic men.

Father O’Rourke’s main service
as campus chaplain to Catholic
“students, however, is to help the
individual solve his personal prob-
lems. ‘Most of the day he spends at
St. Paul’s Cathedral, talking with
‘students and trying to smooth out
their diiﬁculties.

* In addition"to these campus
duties, Father O’Rourke serves his
sick « parishioners and teaches
classes in Cathedral High School.
As chaplain at Presbyterian Hos-
pital he also spends much. of his
time tending the patients conﬁn-
ed there.

Trackmen Quit

“As for bawling the boys out,
the only time that I do that is
when a boy is neglecting his stud-

ond.

“I do not hesitate to correct a
boy when he commits a mistake
in track technique, for that’s my
job. But I don’t bawl him out.”

Olson explained that it is a dif-
ﬁcult proposition to give full at-
tention to all practice sessions,

"Since there is track activity in’
Oakland, South Park, and in dist-
ant cities. In addition to coaching,
he is Director of Intramural Ath-
letics and Head of the Men’s

‘Physical Education Department.
 In answer to the charges against
hisvcoaching ability, Olson merely
said, ‘£1 believe my‘ record speaks

There’s such a thing as being too darned
good! And I

don’t mean holy holy.

Either. You can be so capable that everybody _will delightedly
let you do all the work. It saves so much time. You always

do it right. -

You can be so dependable that your friends will treat you
like the Rock of Gibraltar. You’re always where you re sup-
posed to be. Everyone else can relax...you have the situa-

tion under control..,

You always have the best ideas. Yoifre always in the mood
to launch excitement. You’re president of most everything...
and chairman of the rest. You’re Miss‘Big!

B11,_;,it can be very lonely out there in fyont. Miss Bigs get
themselves so involved with things and projects ...that they

haven’t time for people.

Their big busyness offers stiff competition to the boys. It's
worth a life to get a date with a girl who's consumed by
committees. It’s futile for a mere male to make an impres-

sion on such a powerhouse, It’s too much to hope that Miss

Big can have all this...and love, too. So she goes places

with boys she invites.

Ordinary mortals feel like the tail of her comet. They don't
want it said that they tag Miss Big to bask in her reflected
glory. Lots of girls leave the leader alone .. . and make their
intimates among her other followers. Miss Big knows every-
body ...but pals with no one.
Hark to=this wee voice pleading “don't be too good”. Leave
a few chinks in your armor. Let there be something someone
else can do better than you can. Just to prove you're human
. . . and not a miracle woman. So you can feel affection...‘

instead of awe.

Take time out to be fragile and feminine. So you’ll have an ‘

escape ladder. . .when you’re feeling too solitary up there on

 Cage Tutor

Tries New Rule

Eddie Abramoski, coach at Erie
Technical high school, must have
been thinking of Pitt when he ex-
perimented with the “dead-ball
foul.”

In his effort to steer the sport

away from being a tall man’s
game Abramoski developed the
dead ball foul to give the little
man a chance instead of ﬁghting
for rebounds among towering
giants.
L The essence of the new rule is
to declare the ball dead after a
missed free throw. Then the foul-
ed player is given the ball out-
of-bounds at the spot of the in-
fraction.

“This was liked because it elim-
inated a lot of fouling under the
basket—-and don”: forget that one
of the main ills of the game to-
day is too many fouls,” said Abra-
moski. -

He further stated that the play-
ers could relax during time out.

Gordon Riding, basketball coach
at Columbia university, made ob-
servations at the clinic game be-
tween Columbia and Manhatten
in the Gardens, with the follow-
ing opinion: “This did not work.
It caused a lot of standing around
and gave too much advantage to
the team‘ that was fouled.”

Candidates for the ,mana-
gerial staff of the baseball team
should report to Paul Nuss- _
baum at Gate 3 of the Stadium
on Tuesday, at 3:30 p. m.

Mile Relay Quartet. Douglas
Place In Cleveland KC Games

'9 Commendable showings by Herb

Douglas and the mile relay team
featured the Panther entry in the
Knights of Columbus games in
Cleveland, Friday night.

Douglas was barely nipped at
the tape in the 45-yard dash by
Bill Mathis of Illinois. The broad
jump, I-Ierb’s specialty, Was not
included in the meet.

The mile relay team, minus
Douglas, made a remarkable
showing in placing fourth. The
leadoff runner, Clarence Doak,
was spiked" and lost his shoe, ﬁn-
ishing his lap on a slippery track
with only one shoe on. Gene
Heide, A1 Brennﬂeck and Bill
Morton completed the team.

Fill Wrestlers
Surprise Tech

Panther wrestlers upset the
dope sheet thoroughly by thrash-
ing Carnegie Tech, 16-3, at the
Tech gym Thursday, before a
small partisan Tech crowd.

The visiting ma-tmen -captured
three decisions and two falls,
dropping only one decision. The
teams split even in two .over-
weight exhibition matches.

In easily the top match of the
afternoon Dick Abraham, the 145-
lb. star from Canonsburg, pounded

"out a 11-4 decision over George

Kinsel.

Abraham got off to a good start
in the ﬁrst period, but Kinsel came
back strong ,in the next session.
Two near-falls -in the ﬁnal period
clinched the victory for the

Panther ace. The results:

128-lb.: John Prezzoso (Pitt) decision-
ed Robert Horsch (Tech), 5-4.

135-113.: Larry Dudzik (Pitt) decision-
ed Frank Brandon (Tech), 7-0.

_ Alert rebounding by Bob Miller
and some uncanny shooting‘ by’

the Stadium Court Thursday

9 night.

The Phi Eps had qualiﬁed

for the ﬁnal by copping the fra- .

ternity championship in round-
robin play. For a while Thurs-
day night it looked as though they
might go further, but the gridders
disrupted their deliberate style of
play.
Eds Start to Roll

The diminutive Phi Eps con-
trolled the game for two quarters
and a half before the sputtering
Educator offense began to roll.

Two-man fast breaks by Carl
DePasqua
started the ﬁreworks after the

losers had pulled ahead at 28-20 A

midway in the third quarter.

DePasqua converted a free throw M

and added a rebound layup.

Razzano scored on a fast break
to make the tally read 28-25.
DePasqua duplicated with a min-
ute remaining in the third stanza.
Dick Seewald made it 29-27‘ with
a successful foul shot for the
losers.

Lateano Converts Foul

With seconds remaining at the
three-quarter mark, Guy Lateano,
Educator playing-coach, drove
through for the tying score and
was fouled under the hoop by
Jack‘Pincus on the shot. His con-
version sent the Eds ahead for the
ﬁrst time, 30-29.

Ralph Short started the last
period scoring with adpuble foul.
From then on, it was “Katy, bar
the door.” ‘

The tiring Phi Eps abandoned
their possession style play and
tried to match: the well-condi-
tioned gridders at the fast break.
That was their downfall. Razzano
sparked the winners to a 26-point

last quarter, scoring ﬁve ﬁelders ,

in as many minutes.
Miller, Gilbert Sparkle

The last two minutes of play
were featured by a scoring duel
between substitutes Bill McPeak
and Bernie Barkouskie of the
Barky won, 5-0. ‘

Bruce Gilbert accounted. for the

lead held by the Phi Eps through-

out the.early part of contest.
Ralph Short led all scorers with

a total of 16 points on ﬁve field-

goals and six of 13 foul attempts.
The Educators connected on 23 out
of 76 shots from the court for“-30
per‘, cent. The losers hit 14 of 57
for 25 per cent.

Basketball candidates, fresh-
man and otherwise, should re-
port to the Stadium, April 5, at
4:00 p. m. Spring drills will be
held on Mondays, Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Fridays.

The intramural foul shoot-
ing tournament is scheduled for
Wednesday at Trees Gym at 5
p. m. Entries will be accepted

i  Time for Student Congress

And Inter-Fraternity Council.

 To Take siami on Probe

By John Golighﬂy

It is surprising, when you think of it, the organizations
that have by various stages withdrawn from the athletic
probe. Student Congress, for one, and Interfraternity Council,
to mention another, have maintained a silence which is cer-
tainly admirable for both bodies. ‘

Probably few people remember that Student Congress set
the stage for the present ﬁasco by hastily passing a resolu-

defeated Pitt, 69-0, Congress’ in-
,dignation knew no bounds. They
demanded an athletic investiga-
‘tion.

It seems to me, Student Con-
ress has earned the title of a
it-and-run outﬁt. They create
ssues but seldom follow through
n an attempt at some solution.

It’s Time to Act

1 Since they are responsible, en-
tirely, for instigating the investi-
*gation, they must share the re-
sponsibility for the present situa-
tion. It is time they begin to think
-about a follow through policy.
There is a possibility that the
Board of Trustees will delay in-
eﬁnitely before rendering a de-
- ision. There is an even graver
: anger that the Trustees may sug-
est a line of action which will
ot change the University’s ath-
'.letic policy.
‘ This is the time for thee ﬁre-
brands in Congress to back their
ﬁpquacity with concrete action.
ere, supposedly, sit the leaders
of the student body, yet they have
not issued an official public state-
ment. ' '

 

Congress Does Nothing

They have not urged, recom-
mended, resolved, or requested.
The plain fact is, they have done
nothing. I question the sincerity
of their alleged indignation, their
pious complaints that the admini-
stration has shackled them, their
previous wordy requests for ac-
tion.

In addition to the silence of
Congress, there is the equally
magnanimous muteness of IF
Council. They, too, were extreme-
ly vocal in the past—perhaps not
as publicly as Congress but none-
theless ever ready to take up
the cudgel.

There has been no public state-
ment from IF Council. Why? Do
the people in ‘Congress and in IF

student body foremost, or are they
--as has been claimed—mere key
collectors?
’Congress Must Face Issues

I am putting the issue square-
ly before IF Council and Student
Congress. There are many meas-

suggest the following:

1. Pass a resolution demand-
ing that the University admin-
istration establish a deﬁnite pol-

icy on athletics. '

2. Form a committee to circu-
late, among the student body,
petitions which call for a deﬁn-
ite athletic policy.

3. Present the petitions to
Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
and request a public statement
from the Chancellor as to
whether or not the University
will establish an athletic poli-
cy which will enable Pitt to
win half of its games.

Swimmers Meet
In Intramurals

The intramural swimming meet
for independent teams will be
held today at Trees Gym pool.
Finals in the fraternity meets are
to be run off tomorrow, and the

fratchamps will then meet the
independent titlists on March 31.

The qualifying meet for the
fraternities took place yesterday.
Such a meet was not necessary
for the independents, however,\as
there are not a great many teams.

Broad Jump
Duel Features
Wayne Meet

Two of the nation’s greatest col-
legiate broad jumpers will give a
possible Olympic broad jump pre-
view in one of the dual track
meets scheduled for Pitt Stadium.
The schedule released Friday by
the News shows that Wayne Uni-
versity of Detroit will appear here
May 1.

Ordinarily, this track meet
would not cause adherents of the
cinder track to look twice, but
close observers will be keeping
an eye on the performances of
Lorenzo Wright of Wayne and the
Panthers’ Herb Douglas.

Wright took the national AAU
indoor championship from de-
fending champion Douglas a
month ago. Douglas has also held
both indoor and outdoor IC4A
broad jump championships.

These men will meet in the
NCAA meet at Minneapolis, June

18-19, and the National AAU meet .

at Milwaukee, July 2-3. The ﬁrst
six placers in the broad ‘jump in
each of these meets qualiﬁes for
the Olympic tryouts.
