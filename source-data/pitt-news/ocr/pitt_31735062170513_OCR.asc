  EllsbergOutlinesPublic's Responsibility   

by KARL BALDYS

Daniel Ellsberg, speaking at a
press conference at Duquesne
University Student Union, said
that his release of.the controver-

' sial Pentagon Papers -was "in vio-
lation of no law." Following the
press conference he addressed a

group of nearly 1,000 people in .

the Union Ballroom. His speech
was sponsored by the Duquesne
Union Forum and the Pittsburgh
chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union.

At the press conference Ells-
berg was asked why he released
the secret government documents
compiled by the Rand Corporation
for which he worked; He an-
swered. "I felt it was my respon-
sibility as a citizen, under the
Constitution, to let the American
people know what was going-on
behind their backs and behind the
backs of Congress." ' '

When asked about the recent
peace developments he said that
he hoped they would succeed,
commenting, “I didn’t expect
Nixon to rise above his principles,
but he has.”

When asked if he thought the

A’)

military bureaucacy pulled the
country into the Vietnam war. he
remarked, "No, V I don‘t think
that's true. Vietnam policy was a
_President‘s policy. . . . I think it’s

' the people in the White House who

are a greater threat." Ellsberg
went on to say that “responsible
people must take the risks, and
they are truly great risks. of
challenging the President." 0
Ellsberg also voiced his sup-
port of Senator McGovern. "I
think in View of the polls that it
would take a miracle for him to
win, but I think it‘s a necessary
miracle." »

In his speech before aisympathe-
tic audience of students and pro-

fessionals, be elaborated on his_

reasons for making the pentagon
Papers public.' He claimed’ that
the American public did not un-
derstand our involvement in
Southeast Asia. “They see it pri-
marily asa civil war . . . when in
reality the South Vietnamese
armyis not the army of a sover-
eign state but rather an Ameri-
can army . . . what haspassed as

apathy among the American peo-

ple is really this false perception
of the conflict.”

Educational Avenues

.@Open For University Vets

by VINCE Di NARDO

In an effort to provide educa-

tional avenues for returning Viet-

_ nam veterans, the University an-
nounced the formation of the Of-
fice of Veterans’Affairs (OVA)
Tuesday afternoon.

The organization is the first‘ of
its kind in the Pittsburh area.
Jack Hayes. a Pitt graduate
(1970) and a Vietnam veteran
will head the office.

The main objective of OVA will

be to serve the unique needs of '

the University's 4,000 ‘veterans
and to encourage all veterans to
participate in post secondary ed-
ucation.

Although the office cannot di-
rectly increase the GI bill bene-
fits, which are lower than those
following World War II, the office
will help appraise the veteran of
his educational and career options

by:
—Actively recruiting veterans;
V —Establishing special admis-

sion programs;

—Establishing counseling pro-
grams _and tutorial remedial
programs;

—Assisting in financialaid, and .

—Helping the vet through the
maze of Veterans’ Administra-
tion red tape’.

The establishment of the office
was preceded by an extensive
cross-country fact finding tour:

"Pennsylvania ranks third in
returning veterans and only 48th
in those taking advantage of the
GI Bill.“ Dr. Moye. Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs, noted. "We’ve got to
fill this gap."

“We hope the office will grow to
be one of the finest,” Moye add-
ed.» “We also hope our office will
serve as the unofficial clearing
house for all Pittsburgh vet-
terans.” Vi 

Along with the already existing

. Pitt veterans, the\office will ac-

tively recruit veterans who might
be interested in a college educa-

tion. '

Hayes. who served in the Ma-

rine Corps from 1962-66, said of _

his office: “We feel veterans have
obligations owed to them by the
government—education is one ob-
ligation. To fulfill this obligation,
we are going to give him what-
ever help he needs."

He continued, "People think
that we are supporting one side
while the Russians and the Chi-
nese are supporting the other. But,
their combined aid per year totals
no more than 5-10 per cent of our
aid to support the Southern re-

.gime." He read a recent State De-

partment analysis of the peace
moves and U.S. leverage on Pres-
ident Thieu to accept them. “ . .
although the ARVN has _helicopt-
ers, helicopters we gave them.
U.S. supplies the gas. Although
they have rifles, rifles we gave
them, we supply the ammunition.
Although the ARVN is well paid.
we provide the salaries.“ He add-
ed that should Moscow discontin-
ue their support, Hanoi would
hardly feel the difference.

He also charged that the Penta-
gon Papers proved that the Unit-
ed States has been actively sup-

porting a colonial -regime in Viet-
nam since President Truman. He
read "specific papers that indi-
cated U.S. support for the French
and a feeling among high govern-
ment officials, when the French
were forced to withdraw. that it
was the responsibility of the U.S.
to take over active support of

‘that regime. However. Ellsberg

hypothesized that the,U.S. never
fought for a complete victory be-
cause government officials felt
that was impossible, given the
morale of the South Vietnamese.

"This country has for the last
25 years perpetuated a stale-
mate situation where nobody
wins. . . . The present peace pro-
posals and even our withdrawal
could possibly end up only as a
truce f.or a few years. -The North
Vietnamese and the Viet Cong
will simply wait until they have

  Mailer Lampoons Society,Nixon

.by KARL BALDYS
and SHARON, SEXTON '

Speaking to a full house in Dav-
id Lawrence Auditorium on Tues-
day night Norman Mailer. author
and political satirist, lashed out
at a media manipulated society in
which Nixon pulls the strings.

Mailer explained. “We live in
a benign totalitarianism in which
75 per cent of the population is
grammed to the point of tran-
quilization and psychic nausea."
Americans are hypnotized to the
extent that we can no longer con-
template moral questions.

“There is a deeper state of de-
pression and stasis in this coun-
try than any of us ever realized.”

Mailer continued, “We (the
other 25 per cent of the popula-I
tion) were' the ignorant ones be-
cause we couldn’t see the degree

Campbell, Windt Debate

of the. Speech Department, at a
debate held ‘on Tuesday, Oct. 31.
The debate. held in the Grad-
uate School of Public Health Au-
ditorium between 2 and 5 p.i_n..
featured, along with Windt, Roger
Campbell, a stock broker in the
Pittsburgh a_rea- and a firm
spokesman for the Allegheny

County Committee to Re-elect the H

President.

“I suggest to you,” stated
Campbell, “that McGovern’s pro-
posalssound beautiful, but my
church restrains me from mak-
ing gods out of.politicians, and
so I doubt that any of them, will
be carried out.”

After referring to presidential

vetoes. and Nixon's policy on wel- A

fare, Windt went on to respond.
"if you look at the issues of the
1972 campaign. you will soon real-
lize why the'President is afraid
to come -out before the people of
this country and face them in an
open debate."

’In response to this statement.
Campbell asked, "Do we want

. realistic lea_dership or do we want

to which this society was zonked—
out.” . . ,

From this he concluded. “Nix-
on is a genius because he's the
only man who knew, understood,
and was able to manipulate the
American public."

As an example Mailer cited a
normal Nixontelevision speech.

“Imagine that you are watch-

ing the TV and Richard Nixon is

speaking. Suddenly, the picture
"becomes fuzzy, nothing but dots
and lines. Then the picture disap-
pears‘. and the voice begins to
fade. Finally there is nothing‘ left
but a blank screen and a drone."
Mailer explained that what you
had at the end was the same as
what you had started with. an
electric message without content.
Mailer said that we ‘are wit-

_nessing a political phenomenan

unlike any other in the history of

dreamy leadership who says that
we’re going to try to do everything
we can do and thus do nothing."

Campbell commented on Me-
Govern’s tax reform proposals
and on “his counter-productive
proposed cuts in military spend-
ing,” to which Windt replied, “At

ten the nomination in_’68, to _have-

Mailer finalized his analysis oft‘,
Nixon's character by saying, <'_To
explain Nixon. nothing less- than,
a new theory of personality will-
suffice." ‘ ' ’
Mailer then focused his atten-
tion on the war in Vietnam “Wha_.t
deficiency,oE imbalance in Ameri‘-3
ca has allowed that war to go on"?
What did Richard Nixon see in _tl:ie.
American character which "told
him- that he didn‘t have to -wind

Mailer posed this question to,
the audience and solicited a re-
sponse from several listeners. Afr-._»
ter this be summed up the audi-
enee response and his «own"im-.
pressions, saying, “He felt there
‘ would be a shock, .a recognition,
that the American will-c’ouldn’_t_.

tions, and he ‘thought it was, a
shock which the country could
not sustain.” '

SMC Rally Exposes

by JOHN CAPITMAN

"Rallies like this are extreme-
ly important because they bring
many different forces together-

, but one thing is clear. with all
these different points of view. we
all agree that there must be an
end to the war, rascism. and sex-
ism, and immediately,” said Paul

_, LeBlanc, moderator at a Rally

_ held on Wednesday.

 The rally. held on the steps of
'.the Cathedral, at noon. was or-
ganized by the Student Mobiliza-
1," tion‘Committee (SMC). and was
addressed by both students and
 faculty from various political
 groups. - '
. Cindy Kramer, a junior and
, ‘hmember of SMC, explained, “this
.1-—_ pre-election rally is to give people
a chance to come out'and expose
 the real issues of this campaign,
V -_ like racism and sexism at home
as the offshoots of the genocide
 Fand-.the_ecocide that we’re com-
 miting and will probably contin-
fﬁ ' ue to commit in Vietnam.”
 Bill: Morrison, a graduate stu-
"»;'_ _dent,"and a spokesman for the
 Students for a Democratic Socie-
’ i ty, explained..“Racism is the tool
.g of the‘ ruling class to break up the
7 ‘people, but when we get together,
;;._;’ all of us, students and workers,
 black and white, then we’ll have
:3_.._ a fist. that can smash oppression.“
 _' This concept of "turning natur-
~-al allies into functional enemies
- for-the benefit of the big corpor-
ations, and their quest for contin-
_ ued warring “was reiterated by
,;’.j‘ - Dr. Barabara Schorr, from the
‘ .-School of Social Work. *
- Schorr ‘explained that “we are
not going ‘to deal with the prob-
lems? of the present welfare sys-
tem, until we realize the relation-

    

 

ship between the war in Indochi-.

na,. it's anti-people oriented

priorities, and our own lives here
in this country.”

Daniel Spind, a Vietnam veter-
an. and a member of the Veterans
Against the War. said. "What a
strange thing the vet trip is-—you
know——I don‘t think that any Viet-
nam vets tell war stories—its too
terrible an experience, and yet to
organize people to fight seems al-
most ridiculous in the cynical
apathy that is invading this coun-
try.” ‘

Spind was followed by Richard
Fishkin. a member of Environ-
ment Pittsburgh, who remarked.
"What this means to be is geno-
cide——it is an excellent symbol of
the kind of war we are fighting in
Vietnam, a war of total destruc-
tion of all life."

tinued Rice. "that when their own
selfish lives are let off the hook.
the people cool it, but we must re-
member that this movement is all
we have to save our lives and the
lives of all mankind."

Receiving long applause. after

remarking that he doubted that.

the peace treaty would be signed
by the Nixon administration, Rice
said, “When the war stops. it will
also stop the firestorm of repres-
sion that is ready to break upon
us."

Finally Professor Robert Co-
lodny of the History Department,
quoting the Spanish author Una-
muno, said, “‘There are times
when to be silent is to lie’—and
this is one of those times, when
there are more sca s upon Amer-
ica and her people than there are
shell holes and bomb pits on the
land of Indochina.” A

A note of resolve was added to
the meeting by the appearance of
Arthur Krauss whose daughter
was killed in the Kent State inci-

to the group to dump Nixon and

declared. “I love this country . . . i

Denenberg Initiates New
Grievance Program

Herbert S. Denenberg. Insurance Commissioner for the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania. visited Pittsburgh Wednesday morning to un-
veil a new program he feels will bring "government to the people." His
Inner City Circuit Rider project. organized in cooperation with both
Community Action Pittsburgh and the city's Urban Redevelopment
Authority, will provide "on the spot" assistance to residents with in-
surance problems and complaints. at eight CAP offices.

Each office will be visited once a month by the circuit rider. in-

troduced by Dr. Denenberg as John Mitchell. "No relation to Martha." .

he added.

Statewide, prior to the establishment of the circuit.rider system,
the Insurance -Department has been processing 100,000 complaints
and inquiries per year, 4,000 from the city of Pittsburgh. More than
60 per cent were “found to be justified.” ‘

These totals do not include "urban residents we have been unable C

to reach before and to whom government bureaucracy has too often
seemed unapproachable and unsympathetic."

During the press conference the first complaining consumer_ar-
rived, and was taken to the Commissioner. His complaint was one of
those Denenberg had described as typical in_ the inner city: although
liability had been established. the insurance company did not make
payments for damages the man had suffered. They did not reply when
he wrote to them. . ‘

“And then I’ve been downtown, and I’ve been downtown again, and
they just can”t seem to help me.”

"You‘re at a higher level now,“ Denenberg said. and asked for
more information. The damage had been caused by work done incor-
rectly by a contractor, whose insurance carrier had made no payments
in this or several similar cases. The name of the carrier was important.

“Sometimes it helps a lot when they get a call direct from the de-
partment that regulates their business. But we have to find out where
the problems are. which companies and what types of policies are
causing consumers trouble."

Denenberg planned to make a detour after the press conference to
personally inspect the man’s damaged property. '

Questions raised during the conference c/entered around the Penn-
sylvania Medical Society's demand that the Governor fire Denenberg
(he did not), or that Denenberg resign (he did not). with an offer on
the part of the doctors that they would otherwise quit doing paperwork
on state-supported medical care (so far. they have not‘).

The Commissioner began by thanking the PMS for “their endorse-
ment." and expressed his hope that their medical knowledge is better
than their legal advice." He is planning to bring anti-trust action
against them. He did not repeat_his original charge that the PMS’ threat
was “the most outrageous and incredible blackmail in the history of
Pennsylvania." but concentrated on reactions his office has received.

"The response has been over-

"and that includes a lot of doc-
tors. ~'

“The doctors have my sympa-
thy. ‘They’re represented by the
18th Century PMS Board and the
AMA . . . and that’s a hell of a
handicap.”

One of the offices to be visited
by Circuit Rider John is the South
Oakland Citizens’ Council, where
he will make his first visit Nov.
17. The address is 3603-05 Bates
St., and he will be there all day.

As there is a considerable stu-
dent population in that area.
Commissioner Denenberg was
asked if the specific problems of
college students and other young
adults would be considered.

“Certainly. Everyone on the
staff is a former student. I was
once a college professor, but I
won't let that prejudice the pro-
gram.”

Campbell responded rapidly to
this point by remarking. "McGov-

oric—but it is sti1l_clear that he
has_ become the captive of cer-
tain people whose viewpoints are
in fact reprehensibly opposed to

dents. pressed Campbell’ about
this point, and about the "corrup-

as one student put it.

He responded by mentioning
"the flaky sort of liberals of the

EA—ZPG, Anti-«War

Group Denied Standing  

by FRANCINE ROSE

Two campus organizations —En-
vironmental Action-ZPG and the
Student Mobilization Committee-
were recently denied authoriza-
tion by the Committee on Student
Organizations (COSA> and Stu-
dent Government.

According to Brady Moore, pre-
viously associated with Environ-
mental Action. the whole situation
is a result of a very confusing
misunderstanding.

Moore maintains that Mark
Hiller, former coordinator of the
group, was in favor of moving En-
vironmental Action off campus.

Moore also claims. that the or-
ganization did have at least 10 un-
dergraduate members, but Hiller
took the files which contained the
list and told the Committee on
Student Organizations that there
were not 10 undergraduate mem-
bers in the group.

To add to the confusion. ‘ZPG
had its national charter revoked

and could no longer function.-

Moore maintains that the national
organization prefers ZPG groups
that function on the community
level because the dues are higher.

Moore says that Environmental
Action was not informed (Student
Government says they were) of
the scheduled meeting on the is-

sue, so no representatives of EA

were present to appeal the deci-
sion of COSO.

Moore said. “There is not an ,3 

effective organization oncampus. .
I feel that it is a considerable loss
to the students? I

The Student Mobilization Com-
mittee is a new group, concerned
with ending the Vietnamese con-
flict, which applied for authoriza-
tion and was refused. The objec-
tions posed by Student Govern-
ment were that there are already
three organizations on campus for
the same purpose—SDS. Progres-
sive Labor Party. and the Revol-
utionary Socialist Union.

Paul LeBlanc, a member of the-I

group, said that the question is . ‘

one of central administrational
authority. “It should be up tothe
people in the University commun-
ity to have the right to. organize.
This is a very dangerous rule and
should be fought.” The members
feel that Student Mobilization is
based on what is essentially a sin-
gle issue, and that stude'nts_shouId
not be forced to join organizations

like the sns which have broader _ Ti

political meanings;

"We are going to fight it with‘ I

other people in the U"niversitv.
and if necessary we are going to
be in touchwith lawyerson the is-

sue. Ours is a _dynamic. vital and_ _

active group," LeBlanc said._ «* -

 Despite the powerful attractions of apathy, there has been con-
‘;7_siderable interest on campus in the upcoming elections. For some
 reason this attention has been concentrated almost exclusively on the
3.. 3 presidential contest.

fo r '- Granted, the presidency is important. The occupant of that
'A office will affect all our lives. at least indirectly, for the next four
g years. However, there are many more-offices at stake in this elec-
tion. Indeed, with various _ referenda and non-partisan positions
 included, the ballot this year is almost staggeringly complex.

I’ll try to confine myself to elective offices of the usual sort.

 

 

   
 

In addition to the presidency and vice-presidency, voters will

 be called upon to choose legislators of as many as four sorts:
 .U.S. Senators and Representatives, and Pennsylvania Senators and
’ ,_ Representatives. Thetwo U. ‘S. Senators from Pa. are well known,
'1 but neither seems to be running this year. The Representatives are
ya little more obscure. You may not even know who yours is, but
 he is sure to be running in an even-numbered year. There’s a chance
' j y_ou’ll_ recognize his name on the ballot, though. If you don’t,
r'he?II'”be identified as “Inc.” or “Incumbent.” If you like him per-
sonally, or the world as it is, vote for him. Otherwise, if you think
5 change is a good thing for its own sake, vote for the other guy.

, _' These constituencies ‘are so large that even a bloc vote of all
vthe thousands of registered voters here at Pitt might not affect the
 outcome. 4 ,
 4 So far it looks pretty hopeless. We are lost in a great shapeless
,_..electorate.
_ There is a flicker of hope, Remember those State Senators and

Representatives? They operate on a much smaller population base.
‘.';A determined electoral enclave, like Pitt, might. have a decisive
._voice in" the outcome of State-level elections.

 It would be to our advantage to choose these legislators care-
a fully. We. are a state-related university, after all, and these are the
Tmen who control our funds and occassionally try, to make policy de-
 cisions for us.

j Unfortunately, I have no idea who these men are, neither the
 incumbents nor the challengers. None of them seems to have cam-
[Tpaigned on campus, where thousands of their constituents live and
' work._None has distributed so much as avposter to introduce him-
}'-'self.' A‘ —

»’ They ‘may believe their chances of winning are better if they‘
remain anonymous all the way to election day. Perhaps they are
£1-right——I"d ‘hate to be a Pennsylvania legislator obliged to run on his
1-record. But surely the challengers, who do not have the embarrass-
’-"ment _of a term in Harrisburg behind them, could stop by on an off
'-nday. ' ’

  
  
  

   
  
 
   
   
  
  
  
  
  
   
    
 
   
   
  
  
  

  

 

 

 

" DearrSir:
"Looks like I’ll continue to re-
act to’ Young Alstadt’s Selective
I-Iistory series on the Ni_xon
Administration as long as the
‘Pitt News chooses to print my
,1‘-jresponse‘s. Let us tweak our
memories with some facts :-

.A. Federal spending on health
, hasvdecreased basically for two
 reasons: (1) an increasingly health-
7 conscious Democratic Congress
 .~tRibicoff, Kennedy, etlal, plus a
"yfew refreshingly exceptional Re-
" Lpublican allies like Pennsylvan-
," ia’s,. Dick Schweiker) which has
 ’ discovered how terrible Ameri-
.. ca’s health delivery system is,
fand cares about it, and (2) the
3 hugh rise in health costs (an-
_other Nixon price-freeze triumph).
Hospital .cost inflation alone
-would have produced, a sizeable
increase in expenditures these
 past several years through exist-
  ring federal health aid programs.

B. “The free market economy

strongly opposes “socialized medi-
cine” and runs Mass. General on
a completely voluntary, non-
union basis). Knowles and the
others of course are right, and
here again the Nixon band-aid
Imeasures-A do not and will not
produce the necessary change.

C. Though some of us may
harbor some skepticism until
independent reports on imple-
mentation come out, Nixon can’
be credited (political. pressure
helped) for the agreement with
Turkey on squeezing that source
of opium export to the US. Yet
it has been reliably estimated
that as much as one-third or more
of the whole US supply of hero-
in comes from SE Asia.

There has been no drug crack-
down deal there by Nixon in four
years. Hopefully, the tone of
the recent, ‘proposed settlement
in Vietnam may lead to turning
off the drug profit faucet in
Saigon, but recent Pentagon
figures reveal that Thailand
is the real trouble; hard drug
use among GI’s there has increas-
ed five times just over the past
few months, and heroin is both

-cheaper and more available in
Thailand than in Vietnam. It may
be significant, therefore. to note
that specific among the peace
proposal points is the continued
American military presence in
Thailand. We of course need
Thailand’s continued "permis-
sion” to stay there, if we are to
keep hawkish cold war eyes
trained on,Hanoi in the post-
settlement period. Anyone for
bets on how vigorously Nixon
will pursue shutting off the Thai’s
drug trade? Smart Money

. would be on McGovern, who talks
about phasing'out our military
establishment there.

D. Nixon's rationale for the
day care veto was ridiculous
("socializing ‘America’s children,”

 
  

 ‘and the tenets of Iaissez-laire
 have not, cannot, and will not
 work for setting physician’s fees.”
 ‘A Sound-‘radical enough to get you
L9 firednfrom Mr. Nixon's employ?
_, fRight. Only in this case the man‘
 making the statement got can-
; * ned before. he was really hired.
 The statement, in an August 1970
” . Saturday Review article, was
 typical of much criticism from.
 Dr. John Knowles and others
-‘over the years. Knowles hap-
 pens to be the general director
of Boston’s noted Massachu-
, setts_General Hospital and, as I’
: -‘hope. readers will recall, was
eminently qualified for the‘
 position of Surgeon General at
f‘IIEW‘to which Nixon appointed
_ him in 1969. But the American
-. Medical Association let out an
hysterical peal of opposition, and
the White House, dutifully genu-
_’. fleeting to powerful interests,

It usually bothers me to see a
girl light up a cigarette. I
don’t really know why, since l‘ve
seen plenty of girls do it, both
in real life and in now-defunct
TV commercials. Maybe it has
something to do with my being
an old-fashioned young person,
or maybe it indicates that I‘m

‘a male chauvinist suffering from

a case of sex bias. Not too long
ago, though, I decided that my
attitude was way out of date,
and that I should change it if I
were to cope with today’s wo-
men. But just when I had started
to turn my feelings around. I
ran across Silvia Thinnes out in
Monroeville.

Before I go on. I should ex-
plain that Silvia was an ""old
flame“ in a very real sense
of the term. She was in both my
grade school and high school,
and this girl was lighting matches
and smoking cigarettes- before
mostof the guys were. So natur-
ally with a long experience in
smoking, she got to be pretty hot
stuff.°I recall that one of her
great skills was whipping out a
pack of. Lucky’s popping one in
her mouth, and lighting it, all
while she was clutching her books
with both hands. The guys always

admired Silvia for this trick,.

but for it alone; her Binaca—
scented smoker’s breath repulsed
every fellow except Robert ‘Mor-
I‘lS.

I say. this because when I met
Silvia, she was not smoking a
cigarette. This smoke-less Silvia
disappointed me, for it meant a
lost opportunity to try out my
new attitude toward women
smokers.

Dear Sir:

The subject of abortion will
soon be discussed and voted upon
by the Pennsylvania State’ Sen-
ate. It seems that the majority
of the members of this body are

5determined to pass House Bill-

800, which was passed by the
House last spring and would
abolish any medically induced

‘ abortions, includingthose caus-

ed by abortifacients such as
intrauterine devices or morning-
after pills, except to save the
life of the woman.

Pitt students can help avert the
passage of this hopelessly re-
gressive bill by participating in
the November 14th ‘Quality of
Life Caravan. As many people
as possible are needed to demon-
strate to the Senate members that
the majority of people in Penn-
sylvania oppose passage _of re-
strictive abortion laws. We will
also be lobbying on a personal
basis with the Senators. The’suc-
cess of this effort depends upon
the participation of large num-
bers of people. In passing. it
should be noted that we will not
be going in support of abortion
but, rather, in support of women’s
right to choose whether\or not
to have an abortion.

Buses will leave from the

Stanwix Street Auto Park at

5:30 a.m. and will start back to

_Pittsurgh between 4 _,and ‘ 6

“Silvia, what happened to your
weed?"

"Oh. smoking got to be such
a drag. I became a "nobody
once those companies began ex-
ploiting women with those skin-
n_\'. ‘feminine’ cigarettes, _and
every girl started smoking. Even
my mum started, and she liked
it so much she changed her name
to “Eve.” Then my sister took up
the habit.”, v

"You mean Virginia?"

“Yeah, Virginia, the slim one.
She got hooked on Binaca just
like me, and when I found out
that her breath still smelled like_

 Anonymous Candidates l’ve Come A Long Way Baby

a five-alarm blaze, I lost all my
fire for smoking. Besides, I found
out I couldn't run after men as
fast as I used to.”

“That’s true,” I added. “And
most guys can’t hack a girl with
a hacking cough.“ At this point,
I realized that I had regained
my former low opinion of women
smokers, thanks to Silvia. I was
very glad to meet a girl who
supported my comfortable old
attitude, even though I had to
drive to distant Monroeville to
find her. I. told Silvia as much:
"I’ve come a long way, Baby,.
but it was worth it." '

Dear Editor:

TWO‘_ recent events trouble
me about the present SG: (1) the

 

referendum on the activities
fee, (2) lack of social and ser-
vice programming.

On the referendum I notice
numerous ads in the PITT NEWS
urging a YES vote. Who is pay-
ing for these ads? Is the pre-
sent SG using activities fees
to promote future activities fees?
If so, this is quite unethical.
Aside from this means of promo-
tion and the obviously slanted
"news" coverage of the referen-
dum, I do, favor a continuance of

the activity fee to preservewhat '

little student freedom now exists
over their money and proram-
ming.

The use'of the collected mon-
ey is connected with my second
point—the lack of. social pro-
gramming. I was delighted to

the failure of the present SG to

Dear Editors:
Having been a draft counselor

these past seven years. I believe-

one crucial point in the ROTC
argument has been ignored.

Unlike any other college course.

a student who drops out of

‘advanced ROTC does not merely

Letters to the Editor

get an F, but is offered into the
Armed Forces. This occures de-
spite the fact that he is current-
ly a full time student or that he
is number 365 in the lottery.

Once the student signs up for
advanced ROTC, the only way
to get out is by military dis-
charge. Any student who simply
stops going to class and drill may

' be snatched out of school and im-

mediately inducted under Sec-
tion 1631.8 of the Selective
Service Regulations governing

induction of a delinquent re-
servist, or more commonly, under
the appropriate military regula-
tions. In either case there are
absolutely no appeal rights of
the delinquency status.

Such regulations are not mere
legal theory, for last year a sim-
ilar situation occurred involving
a ROTC man here in Pittsburgh.
who was turned down in his ap-
plication for discharge as a
conscientious objector.

What is even worse is that
due, to certain jurisdictional
problems promulgated by a re-
cent Supreme Court opinion the
federal court fot the Western
District of Penna. would not even
hire the case. Only Maryland and
Kentucky federal courts had
jurisdiction. Luckily he won his
discharge in Maryland thanks to
expert civilian counsel.

A vital question the adminis-
tration, faculty and student body
must therefore ask is—Do we want
to give credit to participation in
a’ program which has the legal
power to take those who fail
to meet that programs obliga-
tions, and remove them from col-
lege, and further, to forcibly
place them into the Armed
Forces? ‘

Respectfully submitted.

  Cowell Runs For East

Friday, November 3, l972—THE PITT 'NElWS'—-Page 5

Hills Legislature Spot

byRONBROWN_

A figure, familiar to many on
the Pitt campus as the Director
of the Off-Campus Housing Office,
Ron Cowell is becoming more
and more familiar to the voters of
the East'Hills as a young candi-
date running for state represen-
tative. He is challenging Republi-

can representative Richard
Frankenburg in the 34th legisla-
tive district that includes Church-
ill,_ Forest Hills, Wilkinsburg,
Edgewood, Wilkins Township, and
the Regent Square, and Swiss-
helm sections of Pittsburgh. ’

number of positions that his op-

Volunteer Organizations
Slate Recruitment

byBOBGEDEKOH

Recruiters from Action, the
new federal agency encompassing
the Peace Corp, VISTA, and sev-
eral other federal volunteer or-
ganizations will be on campus
from Nov. 13-17. Booths will be
open in the basement of the Ca-
thedral and the Student Union.

President Nixon termed Action
an “alliance of generations”
which will -"let us work together
to seek out these ways by which
the commitment and compassion
of one generation can be linked to
the experience of another.” This
year Action has about 26,000
volunteers working in the United
States and overseas.

Individuals working for Action
receive a subsistence salary for
their work; VISTA volunteers re-
ceive approximately $200 a
month while Peace Corp workers
receive $100-125. Janet Simon,
head of the recruiting team which
will be at Pitt, noted that the sal-
aries received _by foreign volun-

teers are adequate in the pers-,~

pective of their host nation.
Peace Corp volunteers are en-

couraged to serve two years, al-
though the commitment is “mor-
al and not legal,” according to
Simon. VISTA volunteers usually
serve one year.

Simon noted that decline in ap-
plicants during the past few years
seems to be ending, and that re-
cruitment for 1971 was high. Dur-
ing the period of the recruitment
slump, the combined budgets of
the Peace Corp and VISTA were
severly cut.

Nearly 350,000 volunteers have
served in the Peace Corps since
its founding 11 years ago. VISTA,
which was founded in 1971, cur-
recently had 4,300 volunteers.

Other Action programs include
the Foster Grandparents » Pro-
gram, Retired Senior Volunteer
Program, the Service Corp of Re-
tired Executives and the -Active
Corps of Executives. _

A new‘ ‘program, the University
Year for Action, will permit col-

lege students to work full time,

off campus in poverty related pro-
jects. Volunteers will be trained
for three weeks and will serve one
year.

to gather support from Republi-

“Mr Frankenburg voted against
granting 18 to 21 year-olds the
right to‘ vote in state elections,”
he said, “and has repeatedly vot-
ed to decrease state financial aid

to schools, hospitals, and mental ,

health institutions.”

Besides his opposition to his -I

opponent’s record, Ron Cowell is

campaigning on a series of pro-, 3

posals that emphasizes continu-
ing service to his constituents. He
plans to become a full-time legis-
lator,_ establishing a district of-

fice to be staffed by student in-, .
terns. He hopes to be able to im-- ‘ i

prove communications within the
district through a legislative
newsletter to be distributed at
least twice a year. '

A strong advocate of legislative A

reform, Ron Cowellsupports a
legislature reduced measurably
in’ size and opposes further in-

creases in legislative salaries and .

benefits. He states that more at-
tention should be paved to_ "ef-
fective consumer protection and
to tax reform that moves away

from dependence on property, 

taxes for the financing of basic
education.” In a more local vein,
Cowell hopes to effect improve-

ments in the maintenance of they 

Parkway, seeing the need for
the installation of overhead lights.

-While Frankenburg, a recog-
nized member of the John Birch
Society, has refused to consider
a debate of campaign issues, Ron
Cowell is forging ahead in a cam-
paign that stresses personal con-
tact and grass roots effort.

Mailer Dogged by Ardent Fans

.\'oi'man Mailer steps back from the rostrtiiii
and briefly scans the packed house. D'd\'l(l Law-
rence 120-121. The audience is on its feet. applatid-
ing. A few people are making their way to the front.
and then. Mailer is suddenly blocked off from the
lrontexit. ‘

"Mr Mailer. that was just great."

“Would you sign my rolling papers?”

"I drewa picture of you from the audience . . 

Mailer is cordial. He signs the bottom of the
sheet of notebook paper _and examines the portrait.

‘Do I look that sinsister'.'” he asks. as he hands the
drawing back.
"Dont you want to keep it?”

Mailer gestures with the book and papers_ in
his hands. "Mail it to me. Stockbridge. Mass. lt‘ll
get dirty if I carry it around. Whats your name'."'
The artist is beaming.

Student "Government Programming officials
begin to edge Mailer to the door. It swings open
and were outside on a cool Halloween night. Walk-
ing down Forbes Ave. students follow Mailer like
goblins in a jet stream. I‘m right behind him and
somebody says to me. “I feel like a security guard.“

Mailer’s lecture had a cool intellectual drive
that made the listener replay subtleties after the
laughter or applause died away.

."I think Nixon is a genius . . . because he’s the
only man who knows. understands. and is able to
manipulate the American public.

We stop in front of the Black Angus. Some lin-
al hand shaking, and then animated students and SG
hosts are separated. Mailer. "\\"hat’s your name?”

The restaurant is comfortable, and it takes a
few drinks, but Mailer gets comfortable. A woman
at a neighboring table has already acquired his auto-
graph, “My son reads all of your books . . . and en-
joys them.” Three students walk in on a tossed sal-
ad. Somebody says, “Oh no.”

A tall. humble man with frizzy blond hair
weakly advances. "I really appreciated your speech
. . . I felt the things you said. as a person. were
some of the things that truly affected my life."

so YDU FlEGlSERED:’  

.\lailer politely turns and befriends the man.
“\\’hat‘s your naine?” .\'o crisis materializes.
We talk about politics. Mailer likes 'l‘ed Ken-
nedy. thinks he would be an excellent presidential
candidate. He paints Nixon as the winner of some
grand chess tournament but adds. " . the man
makes me nervous." Agnew is smarter than he
looks but will never cross the middle of the road.

College architecture, that is, the architecture
of the new buildings on college campuses, is atro-
cious——“Muss0lini Modern.” It reminds him of low
cost high rise apartments for the poor. He becomes
warm and tells the story of a girl he broke up with
in a long low cost high rise apartment hallway.

Mailer’s gray hair is artfully styled. Deep set
eyes look out of a brooding face that is almost pud_gy
when it relaxes. like the face of a concerned tin-
cle. He looks like a professor from Boston. Some-
one asks. “Did you ever think about teaching?"

Mailer replys. "l have four divorced wives and
seven children. I can't afford to teach . . . but I'd
like to some day." We follow with discussions of
.\ew York City, Pittsburgh, Washington. l‘m'em-
barrassed to find out that Mailer ran for Mayor of
New York in 1968 and I wasn't aware of it.

Mailer asks us a few questions about Pitts-
burgh, about politics, insisting that we know as
much about the later as he does. He listens, he
observes us, as he hasbeen doing all night.

& On the way out Mailer talks about profession-
alism as a writer. "I know. when I sit down. what

l‘m going to do. It's just a question of how long its

going to drag out."

I question him obliquely. something about de-
yelopment as a writer. He responds. "These are the
best years of your writing career. the beginning
years. . . . Its like skiing. The best part is the first
two weeks on skis—it‘s the most exciting."

We walk outside and I thank Chuck Braverman
and Dave Bluey for the interview. Mailer doesn’t
know the Pitt News is here. I turn to say, “It was a
pleasure” or something.

He asks. "What's your name?” But that's
okay. I suppose lecture tours get that way. and be-
sides. if I ran for mayor of New York City and
found somebody who was oblivious to my efforts.
I might not ask.either.

is light and full of fun.

It is, of course, a show based
on faith, a faith of unbelievable
spirit. Those on stage bounce with
vigor and. enthusiasm, roll their
eyes, make faces, and play thier
games while they enact the par-
ables and portray the teachings of
Jesus. They become affected by
their play and learn of his wis-
dom.

Christ. the clown in superman
teashirt. wrinkles his face. waves
his hands. jumps in the air and
endears us to fol_low him. to make
insight with him and to love him.
There is no somber mood here.
Yet. even in allvits gaiety. there is
still a profound message: not nag-
ging inspiration but something
alive and full of vitality. Christ is
made real and that realness is
something that reaches out. 'l‘l1e
effect is remarkably fresh and
inspiring.

Godspells “joy” comes from
the characters and-the stories
they tell. It is with their rich in-
dividuality and personableness
that each finds truth (sometimes
the hard way but always with hu-
mor and. zest). It is in the total
interaction of the entire compa-
ny that one feels compelled to
dwell on the very nature of their
discourse.

Beyond the temptation to rave
over choreography. costumes. su-
perb direction and cast. one feels
almost compelled to rave anew
over the story itself. Songs such
as "Day by Day" and "Turn Back.
0 Man." ring with a solid musical
structure that fits well into the
‘show’s reality. Book and music

     

 

flow well together

What does not flow so well is
when passion and crucifixion
abruptly arrive to draw the show
to an end. This break in contin-
uity is somewhat disturbing per-
haps because there is no lead into
the conclusion. Yet. even so. it is
delicately handled and done with
in the same form as the rest of
the show.

When it is finished. the Christ
the teacher. the lovable. profound
and endearing clown who has call-
ed man to consciousness breaks
the bread and shares the wine at
a sorrowful party. Here is Jesus
and the disciples who had good
times and have learned together.

Judas betrays and Jesus states
his last messages. He bids fare-
well to each person. He flashes
his eyes at one, waves his hand in
a characteristic way at another
and embraces one after one. It is
now a friend going away . . . the
man who loved and taught them to
love.

When it was over. they carried
him down the aisle——not with
doom but adoration and high
glances. The fun was over. The
message had come through as a
sensitive venture into passions
and human joy. The feeling was
not of guilt. repentence. or pray-
er. but of life and celebration.

lt is an interesting feeling to
come at the conclusion of a story
such as this. Once the humans
leave the stage. the concept seein-
ed to linger on. One could really
feel like making it so . . . forever.

‘Fresh Air’

  Shows Artistic. Freedom  H 

by»DEAN SIEGAL

Three very different types of
artists have gathered a display of
their work at the .\luseum of Art.
Carnegie Institute.

Sam Francis. Walasse Ting. and
Jean’ Mitchell have entitled this
new exhibit "The Fresh All‘
School" in an attempt to escape
classification and to show the
right of the artist to freedom of
creativity.

Several years ago, the curator

of the Museum -of Modern Art in .

New York was faced with an ex-
tremely difficult problem. In
seeking to remodel the museum
by rearranging some works, sell-
ing others, and purchasing new
ones, he was faced with the prob-
lem of filling space. (He had
many empty, white, large rooms
with very high ceilings.)

The only solution to this was
the purchase of very large and
modern abstract works with many
colors which all look fine against
those huge white walls. Little did
that man realize that he started
something! Ever since then. the
recent trend in modern art is one
of "bigness“ and bright color.

.,Its a shame too. because not
every modern artist is capable of
expressing himself well on a large
support. Because a piece of art is
big and attracts the eye immedi-
ately. does not indicate its inher-
ent qualities. Such is the case with

Exhibition

this exhibit. Arkus says that these
works are derived from nature. I
was there the other day and _look-
ed for about two and a half hours
and could not find any natural
derivations in the work of Sam
Francis.

However, his designs are in-
teresting. The bands of colors us-

ually frame a shape. Each one of _

these little forms is interesting in
itself, but a whole exhibit of Sam
Francis is a bit too much.

Aspects of nature are visible  i

in the work of Walasse Ting. His
art is extremely and explosively
colorful and the millions of differ-
ent colors become different as-
pects of nature—flowers. leaves.
the seasons. Tings art is expres-
sive and nice from a distance.
l-’erhaps Francis and Ting should
get together and design gif_t wrap.

Jean Mitchell seems to be more .
sensitive to the things around her I ' '

on canvas and the most nature is
reflected in her work. Her many

different textures and colors con- '
tribute to her great style. Mitch- '1

ell‘s art appears haphazard. but

further analysis of her other fine -
works in the exhibit show that her V

brush has a purpose and pursues
it. and accomplishes her purpose.

Take a look for yourself. now
through Jan. 7. 1973. In the final :1
analysis. maybe all this exhibit. 7

needs is a little fresh air.

  Cats Out T o Sneak B

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

Tomorrow may be a day for
surprises for Pitt football fans.
According to the Panthers’ head
coach Carl DePasqua anything is
liable to occur when his squad
confronts its old rival West Vir-
ginia tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. at
Pitt Stadium.

“There’s no question our squad
has _a special feeling for this
game." stated DePasqua. “It‘s a
big game. You can just eliminate
the scores and games to date.
Anything can happen.”

The Pitt mentor is hoping that
anything which may occur dur-
ing tomorrow’s homecoming con-
test will turn up to be some-

thing like the 1970 game with
the Mountaineers..

. It was in that year that the
Panthers came back from a
35-8 halftime deficite to defeat

West Virginia ‘Snakes’ by the

score of 36-35. That game, co-
incidently, was also home-
coming.

WVU coach Bob Bowden and
his squad will do everything in
their power to see that this does
not happen again this year.

lTo insure this West Virginia
will be coming at Pitt with what
DePasqu_a has termed "the
most explosive team we‘ve
played this year.”

So far this season the WVU
offense has bombed their oppon-
ents for an average of 34 points
per game. The Mountaineers’
senior qiarterback Bernie
Galiffa has figured in heavily
in this. - '

In last week’s 28-19 loss against
Penn. State the 6-0, 190 pound
QB from Donora. Pa. completed
21 out of 37 passes for a total
of 341 yards and one touchdown.
Over the season Galiffa has
collected 1.537 yards (105-212)
for nine touchdowns.-

"Bernie does exactly what you
ask of him, he has tremendous
poise." commented Bowden.
"He did an excellent job against

/Penn State under the circum-.

stances.”

“Galiffa is a great drop-
kick quarter back,” agreed De-

Buggs and Mills have collected

Overall West Virginia is 15-3
on the season. Two of these los-
ses, however, have been ex-
tremely hard on the ‘Snakes.’

The second loss for Bowden‘s
squad was against, the Temple
Owls by the score of 39-36. The
Owls jumped out into the lead
in the first quarter. something
that completely stunned WVU.
and never let up,

"I’m not taking anything
away from them but I feel it was
a disgrace for me," ‘said Bowden.
"I feel like I walked into a trap.

“Temple is building up its pro-

but I wish they would quit
building on us\ (WVU),” he
continued. I don’t like going to
the backyards of teams like
Temple who are trying to beef
up their schedules. You can’t
get the boys into a mental atti-
tude to play teams like them.”

Last week’s encounter with

    The Big Four Should Be Dumped 

(Editor's Note: This article is one in a series anaylzing
the Pitt football program in retrospect with the Big Four
Agreement. After a full year’s research, The Pitt News is
‘raking a position; The other stories will apear in The Pitt
News sports pages next week.) I

by VINCE Di NARDO
Sports Editor

Necessitated by the unproductive won/lost record

. of this year’s football team, a lot of executive athletic

positions are openly being questioned by many factions

of the Pitt community. While coaching seems to be the

hot potato among the fans, the people directly and in-

directly closer to the situation seem to be firing the Big
Four Agreement full of holes.

It was ten years ago that the University of Syracuse,
Penn State, West Virginia, and Pittsburgh united to ‘first
stem theﬂincreasing cost of collegiate football by setting
an example to colleges going wild with the recruit-ment
of athletes, redshirting, and procedural decency and sec-
ondly to set up a framework under which the four schools
could someday form a major Eastern independent confer-
ence. ’

Actually, the agreement was in the

when Dr. Tom Hamilton was leading
the Pitt forces—to Chancellor Litch-
field’s signature, in 1963. \

The agreement called for no more
than 100 football scholarships over a
four year period, no redshirting, and
no hanky—panky. ‘

Now, the first two provisions are be-,,
ing looked on as rediculous and the third is drawing many
accusations, particularly directed at_ Penn State and West
Virginia? 

A Closer Look

C Maybe it‘s only a freak coincidence that the Panther-
ers have been losing since the agreement was inacted, but
according to a lot of alumni who have been around for the
duration, very probably not. The way the four schools are
operating, the agreement could very will be renamed the
Big One, plus one, plus one, plus one. A closer look at each
institution might clear some of the smoke.

West Virginia is a very unique example. To be re-
membered is the fact the WVU is classified an Appala-
chian school of the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic
Association). As a result, the Mountaineers do not have
to comply with the 1.6 entrance prediction requirement-
a high school student has to predict a 1.6 academic col-
lege perforinance—as the other three schools do. This
means that the Mounties can accept almost anyone they
want to play football for them‘. In reality, they have their

 

Di NARDO

‘own table (a table they will not provide for observation
to Pitt)» for predicting students, which is another was of

;'  saying the same thing.

Though it is hard to oppose the morality of this, when
one considers the sub-par educational conditions of the
state of West Virginia, the rationality of this is lost when
Morgantown recruiters go out of their state to recruit, us-
ing their own academic table to their advantage.

Why is West Virginia allowed to do this by the NCAA‘?

- Why couldn’t 21 of the 34 WVU freshmen recruits have

been acceptable at Pitt? Why, for that matter, did West
Virginia recruit_34 gridders when they are allowed only
25? Why did the Mounties recruit a Pennsylvania athlete

" who had an IQ of 69, when none of the other schools could

have touched him?

The West Virginia president must have been wonder-
ing the same thing when he was enlightened of these facts
at a recent Big Four meeting designed to-come up with a
congruent academic standard. For, it was reported that
he ‘almost had a coronary when he heard the facts on how
his athletic department was being run. Are the Moun-

.taineers‘,acting in good faith when they say they want an

equal admittance standard and act in an opposite way?

How about Penn’ State. Why are the Nittany Lions
able to win while the other schools have struggled? Part
of the answer has to be found in the fact that the Lions
have been winners. They have had a full-time Lrecruiter for
ten years and have had an academic advisor just as long.

| Pitt just filled these two positions recently. All three of

these factors helped them build a successful program.

When talking about Penn State, accusations of foul
play are always in abundance. The Lions have been ac-
cused of getting morei players than they are supposed to.
They have been accused of _hiding their athletes insome
of the school’s curriculum programs. hey have been ac-
cused of receiving a little help from their medical staff.

It was pointed out that a check of the Penn State rec-
ord wouldreveal an unusual number of medical miracles.
Injured athletes who were ruled unfit ever to play foot-
ball again have supposedly made( miraculous medical
comebacks. Of course, the scholarship of the injured
player would be released for use by someone else. These
are only rumors, of course. But when a indepth attempt
to discover the truth by a certain reporter was made, it

was discovered that it would be easier to break into Fort -

Knox with a can opener than obtain any information.

Syracuse is unique in another way. They are neither
happy nor unhappy with the Big Four. ‘The Orange don’t
even know if they will have a football program in the fu-
ture and are satisfied with the 25 scholarships. That’s all
they want for the type of program they want.

“Even if the Big Four allowed‘ more scholarships,
we wouldn’_t go after anymore than we are presently get-

‘ ting,” noted Ben Schwartwalder, the Syracuse coach.

But, the Orangemen can find some soluce in their sched-
ule. Playing teams like HolyACross, et la, they can still
manage to have a winning sea—son.;v . '

That leaves dear old Pitt. Our University has a rich
football tradition, a tradition which beckons to be contin-

ued. In their attempt to do this, the Panthers playthe 12th B

most difficult schedule in the country-—according to a
study conducted last year. Also, they play schools that
accumulatively average 40 yearly football scholarships, "
employ lucrative redshirting, and run legitimate big time
programs. Doing this and handcuffing themselves to the,‘
Big Four don’t conclusive for Pitt. Actually, Pitt is trying -

to run a big time business while using a corner grocer’-sf _  

business mentality.

Not to be denied is the fact that Pitt has a lot of good   I

football players. Simply, there are not enough of them.

And when you consider the fact that eight Panthers have i

been putout of action this year as result of injuries and

that five freshmen were called on to fill those positions,

you can understand what has happened so far this year. A
school might get away with that playing Richmond, VMI, ‘
William and Mary, to mention a few, but it will not es-
cape the ‘consequences playing the likes of Notre‘Dame,
Florida State, UCLA, and yes, Penn State and West Vir-
ginia. »

Making the Choice

A quick look at the other Pitt opponents willquickly —

reveal why the Pitt squad would have full right to feel 1
prostituted. P V ‘
Florida Statei averages 48 freshmen recruits. Make

us of unlimited ,redshirting—-they had 12 redshirts this
year and 42 last year. They totaled 149 available bodies

with the freshman eligible rule. The averaged one and _

one-half players for every one Pitt athlete.  .
UCLA: Recruited 46 football players for the coming

, year, eight of which were junior college transfers. Totaled.-» 

over 140 available bodies, while employing limited red-
shirting. Again, they averaged one and one-half players
for every one for Pitt.

Northwestern:_ Going through de-emphasis of the V‘ 
football program, the Wildcats had only 30 freshman re- - "

cruits and don’t employ redshirting because they are in
the Big Ten Conference.

Tulane: Averages 48 freshmen recruits yearly. Have‘

20 redshirts on this year’s team, has given out twice as ‘ 7 

many scholarships in the last four years (200) than Pitt A

(100) . Has over 150 active ballplayers. 5 f  ‘V,

Boston College: Although not governed by the Big
Four, the Eagles are staying close to the Big Four re-

quirements, in hope of a coming conference. The Boston , '

figures are very close to Pitt’s.

Pitt: 25 recuits. No redshirting. Seventy-one non-A ,. 
freshmen to choose from. . V ‘ 

The service academies: The academies (Navy, Army, a 
Air Force) are very hard to analyze. They do not give

football scholarships per say, as every service cadet is

on scholarship. .But it should be noted that the academies . . 
have freshmen, junior varsity and varsity squads. And 

every cadet has to play eight man intramural tackle foot--
ball every day from 345 p.m. I '

Running its West Penn Conference record to 4-0.
the Pitt soccer team blanked Slippery Rock State
College. 3-0. last Tuesday at Slippery Rock. Tomor-
row, however the booters will shoot for bigger game
when they entertain West Virginia University.

Although the booters handled the Rockets with
apparent ease. Coach Leo Bemis did not think his
team played up to their potential.

’ -"We weren't real sharp but we weren‘t in any

I trouble." Bemis stated.

Joe Luxbacher led the attack with two goals,
his 10th and 11th of the season. Denny Kohlmeyer
tallied his third goal of the campaign while Bill
Haines notched his third shutout.

Pitt_~_no,_w appears to have a clear shot at the
W'est"~Pe‘nn"~title, receiving a little help from Edin-
boro. On Monday the Scots battled Alliance to a
scoreless tie. If the booters can defeat Indiana. they

‘ will finish with a perfect slate in conference play
 whereas Alliance will not finish with a unblemish-

One reason for the bo0ters' mediocre perform-

ance against Slippery Rock might be that they were _

looking past the Rockets to today’s contest with
W'est Virginia. The booters can‘t be blamed if they
did, because they'll have their hands full with the

to a 0-0 tie with Davis & Elkins and suffered de-
feats at the hands of Penn State and Howard Uni-
versity.

That loss to Howard is still impressive due to
the fact that Howard is rated as the number one
team in the nation. The Mounties are one of the
few teams so far this year to even score on the
1971 NCAA champions.

"West Virginia has a world of talent." Bemis
commented. "They have talent to burn. They're a
ball moving team with backs that are good headers.
They won‘t give you an inch.

The last three times Pitt and West Virginia
have met, the results have been three 1-0 games,
with the Mounties holding a 2-1 edge. Last year at
Morgantown, the hooters found themsleves on the
short end of the score.

West Virginia fields a team with only a few in-
ternational players. so Pitt won't have to worry
about any exceptionally talented superstars. Quite
a few of the Mounties are junior college transfers
that have experience. Joseph Ohakhu. a third team

All-American in 1971; Dennis Almedia; freshman

Jack Cadoso. and Manny Matos will be the Mounties
to watch. _

. "Their problem is putting it all together." Be-
mis noted. “But when they want to. they're tough.

Looking At The Facts

Digesting these statistics, it is very apparent that
something should be done. Putt should either go through
great pains in breaking future schedules or take steps to
be competitive. Dropping the:Big Four and giving out
more scholarships (the coaches think 35 is .a workable
number) to immediately give the program a shot in the
arm. Waiting for the Big Four to meagerly come this far
has been a waste of 20 years. How much longer would Pitt
have to wait for the agreement to change its standarss?

“Penn State and West Virginia are different kitty‘s,"
Schwartwalder noted a recent Pitt luncheon. “They have
been able to hide players better than we (Pitt-Syracuse)
have. Pitt doesn’t have a 50/50 chance of winning with
the amount of people they have. They just don’t have
enough. Carl DePasqua could take his staff to Penn State
and win too. That’s how different the programs are?’

Ladies and gentlemen, this is the opposition speaking.

In 1970. the Pitt harriers won
the Big Four Invitational by a
large margin. Last year. Penn
State won the Big Four. also by a
large margin. On Friday. Pitt will
be looking to set the record
straight.

The Big Four will be held in
Syracuse. N. Y.. with Penn State.
Pitt, West Virginia. and Syracuse
participating.

The meet will be held at Drum-
lin's_ Country Club within the con-
fines of its golf course. Running a
5.2 mile course the harriers will

. be exposed to three different sur-

Looking at the individual teams,
Penn State is undefeated and has
a strong well balanced team. They
have three outstanding runners,
Charles McGuire, Matt Chadwick,
and Gary Gittings. With only one
man gone from last year, Penn
State would have to be rated first.

West Virginia has two excellent
runners, Don Sauer and Bill Hunt-
ington. WVU beat Pitt earlier in
the season, 23-32. The Mountain-
eers would have to be rated sec-
ond on the basis of their showing
thus far this season.

cent,” commented Coach Moll-
enhaur.

Pitt has a fine cross country
team . Mickey Collins, Bob Steele.
Nick Martin. Bob Schurko, Bob
O'Neil. and John Black will all be

goingto Syracuse. Collins. Steele.~

and Martin should do well ‘on the
basis of their records thus far
this season. They have been most
consistent in competition and
training.

Injuries and ailments still plague
the harriers. Collins, Black. and
O'Neil have minor injuries that

“Minor nagging injuries make
the difference between 100 and 80
per cent in performance,” stated
Mollenhaur, “this makes a differ-
ence in cross country.”

With workouts "improving
throughout the season Coach Moll-
enhaur feels. "With continued im-
provement in the Big Four we
could conceivably beat Syracuse
and West Virginia and threaten
Penn State."

With morale on the upswing the
harriers are out to give their
competition a ru_n for their mon-
ey.
