Pitt receives ﬂ rst bomb tbreat
since erza' of/lpril, Sen. Casql

touts campus security bill

Michael Ringling
Assistant News Editor

Following a month—long hia-
tus, Pitt received another
bomb threat last Week, four
days before‘Pennsylvania Sen.
Bob Casey brought the issue of
campus security before the U.S.
Senate.

A press release from Casey’s
office on Monday cited a bomb
threat to Pitt’s Oakland campus
last Friday as additional justi-
fication for a piece of national
legislation aimed at promoting
safety and security on college
campuses. .

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
said that no threat occurred on
Friday. However, on Thursday,
May 17, Pitt Policeresponded to

a bomb threat at the Cost Sports A

Center and Towerview Garage
at UPMC Presbyterian hospital.
Fedele said in an email on Mon-
day that the threat affected both
UPMC and Pitt.

“The notiﬁcation went to city
of Pittsburgh police through
the 911 system, phoned in by a
UPMC employee who received
the threat at the guard booth for
the Towerview Garage, a Pitt-
owned facility that is operated
by UPMC,” Fedele said in the
email. “The threat was made
against that facility and the
Cost Center, a Pitt sports com-
plex. The city police responded,
and the Pitt police assisted. The
building was searched, and no
bomb was found.”

Unlike many of the more than
140 bomb threats the University

   

received since February, this
one inconvenienced very few,
if any, students.

“The Cost Center wasn’t be-
ing used and there were very few
cars in the garage at the time,”
Fedele said in the same email.

Speaking on Monday eve-
ning, UPMC spokesman Paul
Wood said he was not aware of
a bomb threat to UPMC.

“The only threat we are
aware of from last week was at
a University of Pittsburgh facil-
ity,” Wood said.

No ENS alert went out fol-
lowing the threat.

“ENS is designed to alert the
campus community of an immi-
nent emergency that impacts a
substantial portion of the cam-
pus population,” Fedele said in
an email. “[T]he Cost center
wasn’t in use, and the garage
had few cars in it last Thursday
when the threat was received.”

Earlier," in a telephone inter-

I view, Fedele said, “in this in— I
stance, because ofthe localized .
nature of the threat, it was not ‘

necessary to send the alert.”
John Rizzo, a spokesperson
for Casey, said in an interview

‘Monday that the press release
from Casey’s office incorrectly

cited Friday as the day of the
threat, and that the proper date

of the threat was Thursday. He .

added that Casey’s office cit-
ed a report by the Pittsburgh
Tribune-Review regarding the
location-of the threat.

Port Authority cuts looming

5 GB remains wit/rout a plan t0 lobby against tbe cuts

Pat McAteer
Staﬁ” Writer

In light of cuts in the Pennsylva-
nia budget toward higher educa-
tion, Pitt’s Student Government
Board has remained largely silent
on the possible ending of many
Port Authority routes this fall.
In April, the Port ‘Authority
of Allegheny County approved
tentative cuts totaling 35 percent
of its current service to coincide
with Gov. Tom Corbett’s proposed

budget. These cuts will take effect
on Sept. 2, and will eliminate 46
of the 102 routes in Pittsburgh
and the surrounding area. In ad-

dition, remaining routes will face ,

reductions in service including
all but 13 routes endingvbefore
10 p.m.

Corbett inherited a $4 billion
deﬁcit when he took office in]an—
uary, so he proposed-a lean $27

~ billion 2011-2012 budget, which

included cuts targeted at higher
education and transportation.

Decreases in Port Authority
service stem from a projected $64
million deﬁcit in the authority’s
2012-2013 operating budget.

Despite the drastic nature of
the cuts and its impact on’trans—
portation in Oakland, Pitt stu-
dents appear preoccupied with
other pressing concerns.

SGB member Alex Murdoch
said currently, SGB dedicates
most of its resources toward

Management company to settle on unused Oakland property

Josh Won
Staff Wrz'ter

After months of delay due to ﬁnancial strain,
the University and Beacon/Corcoran ]en-
nison Management is expected to ﬁnalize
a deal within days regarding a vacant lot
currently owned by Pitt.

In 2007, Pitt made an agreement with
BC], the management of the Oak Hill apart-
ments behind the Petersen Events Center, in
regard to developing a plot of 23,000 square
feet. The University committed to leasing a
commons building with 20,000 square feet
for the University’s use and 3,000 square
feet for the beneﬁt of residents in a mixed-
use facility. As part of the agreement, BC]
would have half a year to build and deliver
the structure, but there are no solid plans
as of yet for exactly how the plot of land
will be used.

Pitt spokesperson John Fedele said in
an email that BCJ’s inability to meet pre-
arranged time frames for developing the
commons building, due to BC]’s ailing ﬁ-
nances and a dwindling budget, has led to
delays and an extension of the occupancy

deadline, which was originally intended to
be]an. 1, 2012.

After agreeing to an even later deadline
on Dec. 1, 2012, Fedele said that BC] would
still be unable to meet the deadline.

“Our partnership with the Oak Hill
community remains strong,” Fedele said
in the email, “and we envision it growing in
strength and size as the community contin-
ues to expand and further develop.”

He clariﬁed Pitt’s standing: “the Uni-
versity remains committedto assisting the.
community with the 3,000 square feet that
it would like to occupy in a Town Center
Building.”

According to Miles Byrne, the develop-
ment director for BC], the University will
sign an agreement to begin developing the
currently empty lot any day now.

“We’ve had some good discussions with
the University,” he said, indicating that con-
tracts and planning have been taking a great
deal of time. , ‘

Although in]anuary, the University told
Oak Hill management that it would not be
upholding the agreement on leasing a com-
mons building. But after discussing the is-
sue with University ofﬁcials, Pitt decided to

this was an act of good faith to accommodate

of ﬁnalizing the documents. “It’s an extraor-
dinary thing when a university works with
a mixed-income community, and hopefully
soon, Pitt will be a shining example of this.”

Maurice Moore, 32, who has been a resi-
dent of Oak Hill for three years, sees great
potential for a commons building.

“I’d like to see more facilities for kids,”
he said. “There’s a lot of kids in the neigh-
borhood.”

Faith Rojas—Taylor, a junior majoring in
sociology, has been living in Oak Hill apart-
ments since May.‘ She had her own ideas on
what the developed area could do for the
neighborhood.

“The community itself is nice,” Rojas-
Taylor said. “But there’s a lot of elderly peo-
ple, so a grocery store would be something
nice that beneﬁts local residents.”

Regardless of what the space will even-
tually get used for, she saw Pitt’s good faith
in working with Oak Hill as an important
part of the University’s contribution to the
community.

“Pitt’s an institution with a lot of power,”
she said. “And if they can make a difference

in the community, that’s something they

deﬁnitely should do.” ﬂ

Casey’s office sent out a press release
on Monday stating the senator’s approval
of the CAMPUS Safety Act, a piece of leg-
islation first introduced after the 2007
shooting at Virginia Tech that would
enable the U.S. Department of Justice
to establish a new “National Center for
Campus Public Safety.” -

-“Whathas happened at Pitt over the
last few months is simply unaccept-
able, and Congress must take steps to
help schools respond,” Casey said in the
press release. “Pitt’s entire team, from
administrators to professors and first
responders, has done incredible work
under trying circumstances, but they
shouldn’t "have to do it alone.”

The $2.75 million center, to be paid
for by the Office of Dispute Resolution,
would provide resources and support to
colleges and universities during periods
of security threats.

“The center would enable colleges and
universities to enhance officer training,
conduct relevant research, develop pro-
tocols to respond to emergencies, and
increase collaboration between campus
law enforcement agencies,” the state-
ment from Casey’s office said. I

PAT CUTS

advocacy against Corbett’s proposed 30

' percent cut in funding toward state—related

universities in Pennsylvania.

“The transportation [issue] was more
or less put to the side,” Murdoch said. “No
outright campaign has been started.”

V Murdoch also said that the announce-
ment of the cuts in service in late April
made it difficult to organize an advocacy
campaign because of ﬁnals and the end of
the semester approaching.

SGB memberjulie Hallinan echoed Mur-
doch’s statement, saying that no plan for
an advocacy campaign currently exists, but
one could happen in the future. »

For some Pitt students, how the cuts

“We cut back the
service in years
past, and we
can’t afford to do

it again.”
Jim Ritchie

will affect their life is still unknown. Ben
Yasika, a junior. majoring information sci-
ences, said he wasn’t sure how the cuts
would affect him at this point, but opposed
them nonetheless. -

“When I’ve used [Port Authority buses,]
they’ve been convenient,” Yasika said. “It
would bother me if the cuts affected my
ability to go to the other side of Pitts-
burgh.” ’

With Sept. 2 service cuts appearing un-
avoidable — regardless of Corbett’s bud-
get ——- officials from the Port Authority
have scrambled to cut spending across
the board. '

Jim Ritchie, communications officer for
the Port Authority, said ongoing negotia-
tions between the Port Authority and its
biggest employee union, Local 85 ‘of the

. Amalgamated Transit Union, serves the

greatest current concern.

Local 85’s collective bargaining agree-
ment expires on June 2, and.Ritchie said
negotiations between Port Authority, state,

county and Local 85 representatives have
been “positive,” though speciﬁc details of
the new CBA haven’t been discussed.

Ritchie said the Port Authority has re-
ceived support from members of the public
as well as legislators from across the state.

“I believe there is widespread support
and recognition that we need a reliable
source of funding [for the Port Authority,]”
Ritchie said.

Many state legislators in Allegheny
County have vowed their support for the
Port Authority because of its importance
to their constituents. ,

Rep. Dan Frankel, D-Allegheny, whose
legislative district encompasses Oakland,
said the state needs a “comprehensive
transit solution” that includes the repair
of highways and bridges in addition to
funding toward the Port Authority. In the
past, Frankel said, the two issues were
wedded together.

Frankel also said Corbett hasn’t taken
a proactive role in addressing state trans-
portation issues, and has instead chosen
to allow the state legislature to handle
the issue. .

“The governor has been entirely absent
from this conversation and believes the

V legislature should lead,” Frankel said. “But

the legislature» needs an ‘active advocate’
in the governor in order to pass legislative
proposals.” ‘
Kelli, Roberts, spokeswoman for the
Corbett administration, said the governor
wasn’t calling for the legislature to lead on
the issue and was instead hoping for action
at the local level. , A
A “Until there is some local action —
some real steps toward cost containment
—— the governor won’t step in,” Roberts
said.  A
Because Corbett has vowed against
raising taxes in the state, Frankel and

‘A other state legislators have searched for

alternative sources of transportation rev-
enue. Frankel said this package of revenue
sources includes raising fees on vehicle
registrations, drivers’ licenses and tire
disposals. Frankel added that these fees
haven’t increased in 20 years, and the leg-
islation would base the increase in fees
on inﬂation.

Ritchie said Port Authority employees
and Pittsburgh residents can’t bear another
service reduction.

“We need to protect the service that
we have,” Ritchie said. “We cut back the
service in years past, and we can’t afford
to do it again.” '

THE SCHAFFIDAVIT

Online gaming not a good Way for

  students to earn income

Matt Schaff
Columnist

Is it possible for college students
to stop feeling guilty about the
hours they waste on Internet
games like Words With Friends
or Farmville?

Not only is it possible, from
the perspectives of Columbia
University graduates Makhael
Naayem and Dimitri Sillam, it’s
proﬁtable..Together, they have
founded a company that aims
to redirect students’ compulsive
gaming habits in an effort to make
dents in larger social problems —-
such as the increasing ﬁnancial
burden of college education. In
contrast to other gaming sites that
charge users. for moving around-
the virtual environment, their
site, Grantoo, raises funds from
companies eager to market to
young people. Game winners are
paid to the tune of a $100-$200

tuition-reimbursement checks per

daily tournament, with no money
down. Grantoo asks winners to
engage in charity giving, which
has so far accounted for 35 per-
cent of winnings, according to
Inside Higher Ed.

The founders of Grantoo de-
serve credit for producing an in-
novative way to combine commer-
cial interest, social gaming and
philanthropic passion, as well as
for the potential beneﬁts that such
a combination could bestow on
society. It should be noted, how-
ever, that any such beneﬁts carry
limitations and could easily be
overshadowed by costs if Grantoo
becomes too popular.

It is possible the business
model only creates value where
it did not exist before. In this re-
spect, Grantoo’s founders are the
“creative” workers which heads of
state constantly speak of. In a per-
fect world, Grantoo would only af-

fect college students who already -

pour hours into online games with
sure-to-be-zero (or less) returns,
causing them to move from their
previous unproductive activities
to Grantoo games, where they
have the chance of reaping posi-
tive returns. The student win-

ners could use the checks to stay
in college longer and, in one way
or another, spend more money.
Along with these student ben-
eﬁts, tournament “sponsors”
get a unique funneling channel
to advertise their products, and
charities receive some amount
of increase in donations. By en-
ticing sponsoring businesses to
spend more of their cash in this
way, the Grantoo scheme could
endogenously stimulate economic
activity.

all of us have
— snugly tucked
back in some
corner of our
human brains -A
an innate tendency.
to want something

for nothing 

But the world isn’t perfect —
reality is much less rosy. '

The problems with Grantoo
begin with a potential ﬂaw in the
premise. Companies that partner
with Grantoo essentially pay for
access to the website’s consumer
audience (i.e. the student gam-
ers). Putting aside the possible
tax breaks and altruistic inten-
tions, companies would only
commit to regular sponsorship
if they thought there would be a
possibility for a positive return on
their investment. That means the
scheme would work only if compa-
nies could take more money from
students than the students would
win. If the ads were to increase

students’ consumer spending (on
the advertised products), Grantoo
would actually defeat its own pur-
pose of helping students’ ability to
afford college by reducing the av-
erage gamer’s disposable income.

While a veritable risk, that
ﬂaw is not as worrisome as other
problems. Since students could
simply rearrange —- not increase
—— their consumption behavior
and companies might only want
to cash in on newly synthesized
public goodwill (outside of stu-
dents). The greater worry is more
fundamental: Incentivizing game-
playing over more economically
valuable activities —— like studying
—— may be far from what college
students need.

At the moment, Grantoo’s
payouts are small and number
relatively few. According to In-

_ side Higher Ed., a mere 2,000

people (with university IDs) have
registered so far. As a small op-
eration, little harm can be done,
as it’s likely that already—hooked
gamers occupy the lion’s share of
participants. But, the site only
launched in late March. Given
some word of mouth and the fact
that gamers can’t lose money, it’s
not hard to imagine Grantoo tak-
ing off on campuses across the
country come next academic year,
thereby attracting more sponsors,
divvying up larger payouts and —
the disturbing part —— ﬁlling its
gamer ranks with non-traditional
gamers.

That’s because all of us have -—
snugly tucked back in some corner
of our human brains —— an innate
tendency to want something for
nothing, for gain without pain.
This unfortunate tendencycposes
to both stimulate Grantoo par-
ticipation and be retroactively en-
hanced by that participation. Just

like how 19th-century merchants I

regularly abandoned their trading
posts for the stock exchanges to
speculate in asset bubbles (oppor-
tunities to make easy, but unsus-
tainable, proﬁts), the prospect of
making hundreds of dollars while
having fun on the Internet could
pull students from their books,

I walked by afriend’s place the other
day, and I saw people sitting on the
porch. It’s routine for me to wave
a friendly hello and chat for a few
minutes, so I readied my hand and
cleared out my throat. Only, as I ap-
proached, I realized that the porch
was not populated by my friends.
I didn’t know these people. I was
stumped about what could have pos-

sibly changed until I realized that
something tr_agic_had happened 
‘ again: graduation.

What happens when we gradu-
ate? There are few questions that
I ponder more often than what lies
beyond the end. And now that I am
likely less than a year away from my

downfall, it is all that I can think —

about.

This year ended a little differently
than most — there was a lot more
evacuating and a lot less on—cam-
pus living -— but there was still no
stopping the inevitable. As I packed
away my things and got ready for an
upcoming move, another class of
my brethren moved on to the world
beyond.

Their families assembled.

‘Sound of My Voice’takes an
  inquisitive look at

“Sound of My \/oice"
(Directed by: Zal Batmangiij

Starring: ‘Christopher Denham,
Brit Mariing and Nicole Vicius

Grade: B

Anna ‘Weldon
'A&D°E Editor

A long,.hot shower and an elabo-
rate handshake are all itjvtakes to
get into the basement.

“Sound of My Voice” takesna
cinematic approach to exposing
the obsessive and illogical nature
of cults. Director Zal Batmanglij

introduces Maggie (Brit Marling),
an enigmatic woman who claims
to be from the future and to have
the power to save a select num—
ber of people that have joined the
group.

In the ﬁlm, elementary school
teacher Peter Aitken (Christo-
pher Denham) goes undercover
to write a documentary exposé
about the woman in the basement
and her fictitious predictions of
the future. Acting as investigative
journalists, he and his girlfriend
Lorna (Nicole Vicius) will do al-
most anything to reveal the truth
behind the cult and how obviously
unreal the charade is.

Peter and Lorna take the nec-
essary precautions before ﬁnally

going with the cult to a secluded
location. They are later accepted
as members of the select collec-
tion of devoted followers.

the movie lacks certain elements

You paid your money. You should
get to see the show.

But you could be in a theater
with assigned seating, behind
an overly enthusiastic attendee
whose hands remain ﬁrmly in the
air in the way of the leader singer.
It’s ﬁne. You always did like staring
at the bassist anyway.

With all your free time this
summer, there’s no doubt you’ll
try to get your grubby little hands
on as many concert tickets are
possible. There’s also little doubt
that you’ll encounter rude concert-
goers who make the show a less-
than—perfect experience that fails
to meet your expectations.

Concert etiquette has a contin-
gent set of rules by which viewers
should abide. Here’s some advice
that will help you avoid being the
person who ruins the show and
teach you how to deal with the
aforementioned rude concert-
goen

Over-enthusiasm

One time, at a concert in a
theater where you’re trapped in
your seats, I saw a man who held
his arms in the upright position
for the whole concert, screaming
“WOO” nonstop. Unfortunately,
the band was The Decemberists

, and not White Snake in 1987, so

everyone else watching the show
wasn’t into his obnoxious display
of fandom.

He promised he’d put his hands
down — “after the opener,” “after
this song” — myriad times but
never did. And though it only re-
ally bothered the girl directly be-
hind him, she couldn’t see at all
and it ruined the entire concert.

Don’t be that guy.

How to deal with that guy: Po-
litely ask him to keep his hands
down. Chances are if he’s this riled
up in a crowd ‘of indie music lov~
ers, he’s a powder keg. If you’ve
implored and he hasn’t obliged,
ask a bit more ﬁrmly. If he starts
to make you nervous, ask a nearby
security guard to help convince
him. ‘ ,

One note: If you’re not at a ven—
ue where you’re trapped in your
seat, avoid the conﬂict entirely
by moving.

I.

ontrol rowdy audiences

Dancing

Even the worst dancers who
have no rhythm get to dance Fit
shows. As long as you don’t mind
the potentiality that you’ll be the
next viral video to hit the web, you
can do whatever you’d like, barring
one thing.

You can’t dance in a way that
ruins everyone else’s time. Trying
to start a mosh pit at a Damien
Rice concert? I think not.

How to deal with dancing:
It’s likely that if you’re in a venue
where people are thrashing about,
there’s space to move. Do so. ‘

.-Clapping

Personally, I think the clap is
like some sort of unseemly plague
that rips through a concert popu-
lation (bah dum tish). But that’s
just a personal sentiment. Most
people enjoy clapping during a
concert because it makes them
feel like a part of the show. And
besides, back~up singers even
march to the front of the stage
just to start a clap.

Fine, indulge. just be aware
of what type of concert you’re at-
tending —— and the extent of your
rhythmic abilities. If you have bear
claws that crack like thunder with

(every clap and you are on-par

rhythmically with the species, you
should consider abstaining from
spontaneous claps (i.e. claps the
band didn’t start).

Clapping is especially out of
line when the whole audience gets
into it right before a time change
that leads them to all awkwardly
slap their palms together cacopho-
nously, desperately trying not to
lose the beat. _

How to deal with clapping: Grin
and bear it because people who
otherwise never engage in music
pursuits love clapping.

Dressing

This is more of an individualis-
tic thing. Dresshowever you like,
but if you’re the kind of person
who’s easily embarrassed by stick-
ing out, you may want to plan your
outﬁt selection to mesh with the
concert crowd." *5

(Ki FEM PAGE 9

j I have a friend who once went
to a concert with a guy without
looking up the group beforehand.
She wore ﬂoral. It was a metal
show.

How to deal with dressing:
Figure out what kind of band
’you’re seeing and go from there.
Look at photos from past shows,
and decide what is best for you
to adorn during the show. And if
you don’t mind sticking out, then
dress away!

Smoking/Drinking

Once, at a concert, the girl next
to me took a ﬁnal sip of her last of
many beers and promptly vomited.
It was a pretty fast way to make
space at an otherwise crowded
show, but it was also very gross.

There’s nothing wrong with
drinking — if you’re of age — at a
concert, but try not to get so drunk
that you harsh everyone else’s mel-
low. Excessive drinking can ruin
any evening, but it can completely
destroy a show for you and your
fellow concert-goers.

As far as smoking goes, some
places have designated areas, some

don’t. Like anywhere else, don’t
blow it in people’s faces — unless
they’re into that kind of thing.

How to deal with smoking: De-
pending on the band you’re see-
ing, there may be several kinds
of smoke mingling just north of
your nostrils. If you’re bothered
by it, you might have to wander
your way to the back of the venue.
Frankly, there’s no way to get that
many people to stop smoking for
your delicate nose.

There are many complications
that could continue to arise while
attending a concert, but the key to
a successful show is letting go and
enjoying the music. I

FILM REVIEW

Men in Black 3 Vzdds it mediocre
addition to t/aeﬁrimc/vise

“Men in Black 3"
Directed by: Barry Sonnenfeid

Starring: Will Smith, Tommy Lee
Jones, Josh Brolin

Grade: B-

/Jleff Ihaza
Staff I/Vriter

The 1997 classic “Men in Black”
holds a special place in American
ﬁlm history. But its sequel, “Men
in Black 2,” did not have the same
effect.

This 2002 disaster of a ﬁlm
made any hope for the future of
the franchise bleak. As a result, it
seems only natural that the latest

MCT Campus

addition to the franchise, “Men in
Black 3,” goes back in time to 1969
to ﬁnd its plot.

The ﬁlm features all of the iconic
characters from the franchise
played by the same actors. The story
centers on Agent] (Will Smith), who
discovers that his longtime partner
Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) is in
danger from a time—traveling alien
named Boris. The ﬁlm follows Agent
J as he travels to 1969 to prevent
Boris from altering history.

The premise of the ﬁlm is an ob-
vious parallel to the “Back to The
Future” franchise, which — unlike
“Men in Black” —- never stumbled
in its sequels. The difference with
“Men In Black 3” is how gracelessly
this plotline is handled.

Almost as if the ﬁlm’s writers
were aware of the unoriginal con-
cept of earth-saving time travel, the

action in the movie simply happens,
as opposed to building up to any-
thing signiﬁcant. ’

The movie’s saving grace is the
highly compelling performances
given by its cast. The 1969 version
of Agent K, played by Josh Brolin,
looks so similar to the Agent K of
the original ﬁlm that it’s almost im-
possible not to feel a certain tinge
of nostalgia while watching.

As always, Will Smith provides
enough of a reason to go outand
see the movie, giving yet another
stellar performance and adding an
element of excitement to the other-
wise cliche-riddled ﬁlm.

The series could have ended
with the ﬁrst ﬁlm — it certainly
didn’t need the second — but
while “Men in Black 3” doesn’t add
anything new to the franchise, it
doesn’t hurt either. I

i/WI diig
motivation behind their interest.

Though “Sound of My Voice”
might not hit every cinematic ex-
pectation, it does make a deeper
cultural statement about society.
It exempliﬁes the inability to rea-
son when faced with faith and
indoctrination, which can lead
to harmful consequences.

Like historical accounts of
cults, things tend to go awry
once new members are inducted.
Though “Sound of My Voice” re-
mains solidly ﬁction, it replicates
the intensity of cults that exist
and those that have existed in
the past.

Set in an undisclosed_location,
the ﬁlm depicts the cult meet-
ing in the middle of the night in
an empty house “somewhere in
the valley.” The group holds its
meetings in the house’s elaborate
basement that has been equipped
with a sufficient amount of home-
grown food and medical supplies
to sustain Maggie in her fragile
state as a woman from the future.

Claiming to have arrived from
the year 2054, Maggie proves her-
self as a future being to the cult,

‘ but loses a_few followers along

the way because of the vagueness
of her message. She has many
characteristics in common with‘
a con artist, causing some, such

as Peter and Lorna, to doubt her '

message.

The couple, still committed to
their mission, are forced to take
part in various strange activities.

From eating worms from Mag-
gie’s hands to vomiting their food
into a collected area of ﬁlth, the
two continually delve deeper into
cultic life.

They soon realize the inten-
sity of their project, and as their
level of duty to the documentary
changes, their relationship be-
comes strained. The movie shows
how a commitment to a cult can
cause real—world relationships to
change, making it difficult for cult
members to connect with others.

The group expects nothing but
sound devotion from its follow-

ers, and though Peter and Lorna‘

originally enter the group as
inactive participants, they soon
get caught up with the message
of the cult. Maggie -promises the
group salvation with the coming
of the future.

Peter, the initial voice of rea-
son, falls into a love—like trance
with Maggie because of her ability
to sway his emotions. He aban-
dons his logic to become a devot-
ed follower, and despite his best
efforts to deny any afﬁliation, by
the end of the movie, it’s clear
where his loyalties lie.

Original roles change and
diverge, and whatthe audience
believes initially does notcome
to be in the end. The characters
are hardly static. They change
drastically over the course of the
movie, exposing inner truths that
would otherwise go unnoticed.

“Sound of My Voice” demon-
strates the ways in which a cult
can turn logical individuals into
hopeful believers. I

Senior Stqff Writer

Going into the ﬁnal weekend of
the Big East regular season, four
teams prepared to battle for the
ﬁnal spot in the Big East Tourna-
ment in Clearwater, Fla.

With the all—important No. 8
spot in the standings on the line,
the Pitt baseball team prepared
to host Louisville. The Cardinals,
despite already clinching their

" "place in the tournament, had a lot

to play for, as they could still earn
the regular season Big East title.

After a nervous weekend that
saw Pitt drop two of three games
to Louisville, the Panthers snuck
into the tournament after losses
for Villanova and West Virginia
combined with a Georgetown
win to create a three-team tie
for the eighth spot. Pitt, Villa-
nova and Georgetown all ﬁnished

the regular season with a 10-17

‘conference record, but the Pan-
thers, because of their 2-1 record
against the Hoyas, earned the
ﬁnal spot in the tournament.

“I am pleased that our seniors,
all of whom have had great ca-
reers at Pitt —— Matt Iannazzo,
Anthony DeFabio and Rick De-
vereaux — will have the opportu-
nity to play for a championship,”
Pitt manager Joe Jordano said.
“They are great players and even

. better kids. It was a privilege to

/ .5,
coach them.”

Louisville 6, Pitt 5 (12 in-
nings)

Iannazzo took the mound in
Thursday’s series opener for the
last time at home looking for a

—=--“-big win.

The Panthers jumped out to
an early 2-0 lead in the bottom
of the first inning on only one
hit. Sophomore outﬁelder Ste-
phen Vranka scored after walking

,.___when freshman outﬁelder Boo

Vazquez grounded into a double
play. DeFabio, the designated hit-
ter, reached on a ﬁelder’s choice
and was driven home by junior
third baseman Sam Parente, who
got the only hit of the inning.
Louisville got on the board
with a single that brought in a
runner who reached on an error
by junior shortstop Evan Oswald,

and the Cardinals tied the game
in the third inning when Oswald
took the out at ﬁrst, allowing a
runner to score.

With the game tied up, the .
Panthers plated three runs in
their half of the third inning to
build a 5-2 advantage. Vazquez
singled in first baseman De-
vereaux, who reached on a single.
Following a double by sophomore
outﬁelder Casey Roche, Vazquez
scored when Parente picked
up his second RBI of the game
with a single, and Roche came
home when freshman catcher
Elvin Soto reached on a ﬁelder’s
choice.

The scoring stopped until the
top of the seventh. After picking
up two outs, Iannazzo got the hit-
ter to pop up to right ﬁeld, but
Roche was charged with an er-
ror after missing the ﬂy ball. The
Cardinals took full advantage of
the Pitt mistake by plating three
runs, all unearned, to put an end
to the senior pitcher’s ﬁnal home
start. 5 ‘

Iannazzo’s day ended with six
and two-thirds innings pitched,
zero earned runs, four hits, four
strikeouts and three walks.

The game continued score-
less for four more innings before
Louisville broke the 5-5 tie in the
top of the 12th inning.

].R. Leonardi entered the
game for the Panthers and let
up two’ singles followed by two
straight walked batters to give
up the game-winning run.

Devereaux singled in the bot-
tom of the inning and was bunted
to second base, but the Panthers
were unable to come up with the
tying run and disappointingly‘
dropped the first game of the
series.

Pitt 8, Louisville 2

Sophomore right-hander
Ethan M-ildren put the team on
his back in another crucial game
for Pitt and recorded a complete
game as the Panthers picked up
the win in Friday’s game. Along
with Mildren’s great pitching, the
offense provided plenty of sup-
port and allowed him to pitch
with a lead for much of the game.

Lacrosse team pleased with season after
first appearance in 

Jasper Wilson
Assistant Sports Editor

Despite not advancing beyond the
ﬁrst round of the Men’s Collegiate
Lacrosse Association National
Championships in Greenville,
S.C., last week, the members of
Pitt’s men’s lacrosse team ended
the season knowing that they ac-
complished what they had set out
to do.

After narrowly missing out on
the MCLA National Tournament
each of the past few years, the
team decided to set two goals for
this season when it convened in
the fall: winning its conference
—— the Central Collegiate Lacrosse
Association — championship and
earning Pitt’s ﬁrst-ever bid to the
national tournament.

The pursuit of both goals en-

teredits ﬁnaljlsptage onceclasses

ﬁnished at  end of April.

First, the team had the _CCLA . —

Championships, which took
place the ﬁrst weekend in -May.
Since Pitt’s classes end earlier
than most other schools’, play-
ers stayed on campus afterthe
end of the semester to continue
practices. V ‘

In the semiﬁnals, Pitt dis-
patched Ohio for the second time *

this season, 18-13.
The victory meant Pitt would
face Michigan State in the ﬁnal.

The teams’ ﬁrst meeting was a .

17-16 overtime thriller won by
Michigan State.

The second meeting had
greater stakes, with the winner
set to earn an automatic bid to the
MCLA National Tournament. Un-
fortunately for the Panthers, they

-tans rolledto a 15-4 victory. L A
Not securing the automatic bid

meant that the team had to hope
it would receive one of the six at-
large spots in the 16-team MCLA
Tournament.

Senior captain Nick Ruff had
conﬁdence that the Panthers
would make the tournament,
citing that the selection criteria
focuses on nonconference results,
willingness to travel and a varia-
tion of the Ratings Percentage
Index.

He also said not having made
the tournament before means
there’s always a little doubt in

Stqff Writer

The season doesn’t start for three
months, but it’s hard to ignore the
impact new head football coach
Paul Chryst has had on the program
since his hiring in January.

After last year’s 6-7 debacle
under a head coach who won’t be
named in this column, Pitt athlet-
ic director Steve Pederson ﬁnally
made an investment in the future by
hiring Chryst, who was Wisconsin’s
popular offensive coordinator.

For those of you who haven’t
paid attention to Pitt athletics over
the last two years, Pitt has hired
three head coaches since Dave
Wannstedt’s resignation under
pressure in late 2010. Shortly after
Wannstedt’s departure, Pitt hired
former Miami University (Ohio)
coach Mike Haywood, who was sub-
sequently dismissed after he was

arrested on charges of domestic -

abuse in South Bend, Ind.

Reeling from Haywood’s al-
leged personal disaster, Pitt hired
the coach who was mentioned in
the second paragraph. Despite his
arriving in Pittsburgh to massive
fanfare and a marketing campaign
based around his mantra of “high-
octane football,” the Panthers never
fully adapted to the coach’s spread
offense and struggled their way to
a 6-7 record. 9,

Then, days before the Pan-
thers were scheduled to play in
the BBVA Compass Bowl, the coach
announced that he was accepting

» the head coaching position at Ari-

zona State, citing family reasons
and employing much of the same
rhetoric he spewed when he ﬁrst
arrived at Pitt.

Facing a drastic drop in season
ticket sales, Pitt then hired Chryst,
who had dazzled the Big Ten con-

“ference with his high-powered pro-

game and giving some rest to
the guys in the bullpen,” Mildren
said. “After a 12-inning game, it’s
good to get them rest.”

After the Cardinals took the
lead in the top of the second in-
ning, Pitt countered with two
runs of its own. Vranka hit a
sacrifice fly to score Soto, and
DeFabio singled to score Oswald.

In the third, Vazquez scored
when Parente hit into a double

play to stretch the lead to two

runs. _

Then the offense broke out for
a three—run inning in the fourth.
Roche hit a two-RBI double down
the right-field line, scoring
Vazquez and Devereaux. Parente
then singled in Roche to give the
Panthers a 6-1 lead.

Pitt’s offense continued scor-
ing as it added a run in each of the
fifth and sixth innings.

Louisville got one run back off
Mildren in the eighth, but that
wasn’t nearly enough to put much
of a dent in the lead.

Mildren finished the game
with seven strikeouts, two walks
and only one earned run.

“It was a very exciting game.
I thought we executed extremely
well and made some plays today,”
Jordano said. “Obviously, Ethan
pitched a fantastic game. We
got some big hits, so I was very
pleased with the performance. It
kept us alive.”

Louisville 9, Pitt 5

Louisville picked up an early
run off Pitt starter Matt Wother-
spoon in the second inning, and
the Cardinals’ offense exploded
on him in the top of the fourth.

On six hits, the visiting team
plated six runs to take a 7-0 lead
and forced Wotherspoon out of
the~game with only three and
two-thirds innings completed.
His short day ended with seven
earned runs, four strikeouts and
two walks.

The Panthers picked up some
runs with one-run innings in the
ﬁfth, sixth, and eighth innings,
but they couldn’t come through
with some clutch hits that could
have turned those innings into a
true chance at a comeback.

Louisville ended any lingering
Pitt hopes by scoring two more
runs in the ninth.

“Although today did not go
our way, I thought we played hard

,£~..

all weekend. Louisville is an out-
standing team with a tremendous
staff,” Jordano said. “We had our
opportunities to win on Thurs-
day and simply did not ﬁnish the

game.” 4*-

Despite the tough loss, which
clinched the Big East regular sea-
son championship for the Car-
dinals, setting up a first-round
Big East Tournament game on

Wednesday between No. 1-seeds.

Louisville and No. 8—seed Pitt,
the Panthers are already looking
forward to matching up with the
Cardinals again.

“I can’t wait to play Louisville
again,” Iannazzo said.

After Pitt’s chances of qualify-
ing looked slim just a few weeks
ago, the team is pleased to be in
the tournament and knows that
anything can happen in Florida.
Just last year, No. 5-seed Seton

Hall cruised through the double=«..

elimination tournament to earn
the automatic NCAA Tournament
bid.

“I’m excited to get into the
Big East Tournament,” Iannaz-
zo said. “We battled and caught
some luck. We had success versus
Louisville and will ﬁght to the
last out.” I

same teams going to nationals
every year,” Ruff said. “ [And you
think,] maybe they’ll give [the
at-large bid] to a team that’s usu-

ally there.” .

: What seed the team would re
ceive was also a cause for worry.

After the one—sided game
against Michigan State, Ruff said
the team feared it would receive
a No. 16 seed.

But to its surprise, Pitt re-
ceived the No. 10 seed, meaning
the selection committee factored
in the entire season — which, for
the Panthers, included three non-
conference top—25 wins — rather
than focusing on just one result.

“I don’t know if it was shock-
ing, but we expected to be seeded
a little lower,” Ruff said. “It was
nice to see that we got seeded in
the middle of the pack, and [that]
there’s a nice amount of respect
out there for our team.”

The Panthers received an at-
large bid, but their hopes of win-
ning the MCLA National Champi-
onship in their ﬁrst opportunity

to play in the tournament ended '

in the ﬁrst round.
Pitt lost to No. .7-seed Univer-
sity of California-Santa Barbara

13-9, but the trip to Greenville
didn’t end in defeat, as the Pan-
thers recorded an overtime win
against University of California-
Berkeley 9-8 in a consolation
game. ]

Even though they lost, David
Franklin, an'MCLA beat writer for
Inside Lacrosse, said qualifying
for nationals was a huge accom-
plishment for the Panthers.

“This was a coming-out party
for Pitt,” Franklin said. .

Franklin explained how in
the MCLA universe there are two
main groups of teams that com-
pose the top tier of collegiate club
lacrosse: teams such as Colorado
State and Brigham Young that tra-
ditionally have had success at the
national tournament, and lesser-
known teams that have recently
started to establish themselves
nationally.

“These kids [at Pitt] obviously
knew that this year was theirs to
really get into this tournament,”
Franklin said. “This was the year
that this group of kids really came
together in order to accomplish
a certain goal.” i

Rising junior Max Carlson
agreed. ‘

“Everyone just cared about
[improving] more than  in the

. past, and it showed onsthe ﬁeld.”

According to Franklin, Pitt,

which achieved a top-25 rank-
ing for the ﬁrst time in program-\
history by ﬁnishing the season
ranked 10th, is now an upcom-
ing program. Observations from
Carlson illustrate this change.

“We didn’t usually hang with
the best teams in years past,”
Carlson said. “It was deﬁnitely
sweet to be [at nationals] and
for other teams to realize we’re
an up-and-coming club program
that’s going to play.’’

Senior goalie Chris Gorham

is conﬁdent that the returning"

players will continue the progress
that he, Ruff and the other seniors
started.

“I have no doubt that they will
carry on this push forward,” Gor-

hamsaid. “I don’t think it’s goingx.

to drop off. I think it’s just going
to keep climbing.”

While the team didn’t win
the CCLA, Ruff says reaching
the MCLAs and winning a game '

means the season was 3 great
':s—

success.

“It’s the icing on the cake,”
Ruff said. “It’s nice that we can
check off that last goal on the list.”

Carlson is conﬁdent about the
program’s_ﬁ.1ture after a campaign

full of accomplishments. 

“We’re all looking forward to

[next-year,-” he said. “All of -us ex-

pect to go further.” ]

New Pitt head fbll coach Paul Chrst ecny namd seiqr Tino seri(12) as‘

the starting quarterback heading into the new season. Brooke Wieczorek, For The Pitt News

I style offenses.

Coming to Pitt, Chryst faced a daunting
task on and off the ﬁeld. Not only was he
forced to mend an offense that ﬁnished 83rd
in the nation in points scored but was also
challenged with repairing relationshipswith
players and recruits who might have had a
pessimistic view of Pitt after the aforemen-
tioned coaching carousel.

Thus far, he’s scoring high marks in both
areas. 1

Like most newly hired head coaches,
Chryst entered spring camp with the goal
of instilling his identity into his new team.
During his tenure at Wisconsin, Chryst was
known for his reliance on the running game.
In 2010, Wiconsin running backs Montee
Ball, James White and John Clay ran for a
combined 3,060 yards to lead Division I col-
lege football. '

In the ﬁrst spring camp under Chryst, B
sophomore running back Isaac Bennett I

emerged as a potential star for the Panthers,
running for 121 yards on 23 carries in the
team’s spring game. Bennett; reigning First
Team All-Big East senior running back Ray
Graham, who rushed for 958 yards last sea-
son before tearing his ACL against Connecti-
cut, and hyped incoming freshman Rushel
Shell will form an extremely formidable rush-
ing attack for Pitt next season."

Of course, even the most talented running
back can’t succeed without a competent of-
fensive line. Luckily, former Minnesota Vi-
kings offensive line coachjim Hueber joined
Chryst at Pift after 40 years of coaching of-
fensive lines in the NFL and college ranks.
Under his tutelage, the Vikings produced
three Pro Bowl offensive linemen, who led the
way as running back Adrian Peterson rushed
for a franchise—record 1,760 yards in‘ 2008.

But Hueber’s biggest challenge as a coach
will be improving the line’s pass blocking.

_ Last season, Pitt ﬁnished ﬁrst in the NCAA.

in sacks allowed with 64, and this lack of

protection affected Pitt quarterback Tino
Sunseri, who struggled for much of his junior
campaign. If Chryst and Hueber ﬁnd a cure to
the offensive line’s woes and allow Sunseri —
who was recently announced as next season’s
starting quarterback — to manage the game,
the offense should be just good enough when

‘paired with the Panthers’ solid defense to

lead Pitt to a winning season.

Although it’s difficult to judge Pitt on
the ﬁeld right now, Chryst’s workon the
recruiting trail has already received praise
from prospects. Chryst’s relaxed personality
helped the new coach secure a respectable
recruiting class last February that included
ﬁve four—star players, and he has already re-
ceived ﬁve commitments for next year’s class.

Sure, Pitt hasn’t wona national champion-
ship since 1976, and the last time the Panthers
played in a BCS Bowl, they had their clocks
cleaned by Utah and quarterback Alex Smith
in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl. This is a program,
however, with massive potential and- a lot
to be proud of —— which is what Chryst has
reportedly been focusing on when meeting
with recruits.

By taking a patient approach to recruit-
ing, Chryst allows potential future Panthers
to acquaint themselves with the University
and the neighborhood of Oakland. Obviously,
Pitt’s greatest assets are its academics and
campus life, so it’s a no—brainer that Chryst
has decided to emphasize this in the recruit-
ing process. 1

This type of patience should also be dis-

played by Pitt fans when it comes ‘to Chryst‘

next season. -

While Pitt has talent at certain positions,
the team lacks depth, especially along the
offensive and defensive lines. Building a pro-
gram takes time, as anyone who has watched
Pitt basketbal1’s rise to prominence can attest.

But just remember this, Pitt fans: With
Paul Chryst leading the way, the futureof
