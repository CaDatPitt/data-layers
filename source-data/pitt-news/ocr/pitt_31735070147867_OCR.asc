—— and it wasn’t for a basketball
game. . .
About 285 Pitt student orga-

‘ nizations gathered for the 2011

Student Activities Fair, which

was held at the Pete for the first
time.

Before the event, the Student
Organization Resource Center

 predicted more than 6,000 stu-

dents would attend this year’s
three-hour-long fair. ‘ -

_ The elbow-to—elbow human‘

jo-stled and weaved their way

“This is where we get th_e‘big

Pitt changes alcohol policy

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Pitt changed its Student Code
of Conduct to match that of the
state’s alcohol amnesty lawthat
was put into effect injuly.

The law, known as the “Good
Samaritan” law, grants amnesty
only to the underage drinker
who calls emergency services for
their intoxicated friend. The law
states that the underage person
who calls the police will not face
prosecution for underage con-
sumption or possession of alcohol

 

as long as the person satisﬁes four
requirements —— believes he is
the ﬁrst person to contact emer-
gencylservices, does it in “good
faith,” provides his own name to
the emergency officer or opera-

tor and stays with the intoxicated 4

person until help arrives.
Pitt spokesman John Fedele

‘said in an email that the Univer-

sity has made changesto the Stu-
dent Code of Conduct, known as
Responsible Action Protocol, “to
adhere to the policy behind the
new statelaw regarding amnesty
for individuals who take respon-
sible action to assist others in an

alcohol emergency.”

1 The revised Code of Conduct
states, “Because the University
understands that fear of possible
actions may deter certain requests
for emergency assistance, the
University has adopted the fol-
lowing Responsible Action Pro-
tocol to alleviate such concerns
and promote responsible action
on the part of the students.”

The Code of Conduct also
states that, in accordance with

the new law, an underage student ‘

is protected from both criminal

they moved in.

Ryan Dolan, a freshman, moved
into his room in Towers last week
like thousands of other Pitt stu-
dents. However, unlike most of
them, his room used to be his
ﬂoor’s lounge. ‘

“There’s no downside to living
in the lounge,” Dolan said. “It’s just
different.”

About 90 students are living in
lounges this year in Lothrop Hall
and Litchﬁeld Towers, but they
don’t seem to mind. '

Dolan said that he sees no

downside to living in a lounge.
Besides the fact that someone is
always in his room since he has
three other roommates, he is gen-
erally pleased with the unconven-
tional room. It’s three times the
size of a regular double room in
Towers, and it came with a televi-
sion, Dolan said. S
University spokesman John
Fedele said that overflow hous-

‘ ing happens at universities when

the number of accepted students
who choose to come to a school is
higher than expected. The same
phenomenon has occurred ever
year for the past several years, and

ounges ome

 

last year resulted in 50 students
living in the Wyndham Hotel on
Forbes Avenue.

The University chose lounges
in Towers and Lothrop because
they are the ﬂoors that have com-
mon bathrooms. When a student
hands in his or her housing deposit

, is a factor in determining who will

be assigned to the lounges, Fedele
said.

Students who live in these
lounges pay the standard» triple
or quad housing fee, depend-
ing on the size of their lounge.

Former iptrofessorfiles age lawsuit

Tegah Hanlon
Assisant News Editor

A Pitt law professor ﬁled an ‘age
discrimination lawsuit against the
University on Wednesday. ‘
William Brown, 73, ﬁled the law-
suit in the U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Pennsylvania.

- He said that the University hired a

younger professor instead of Brown
for a tenured position.
Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele de-

V clined to comment, and said that

Pitt does not comment on pending
V litigation. - _ ' _
Brown claimed in his civil com-
plaint that with his hiring, the
University “considered the fact
that the median age of the Law
School faculty had increased, and
determined that this was a nega-
. tivé factor that needed to be:-__ad—
dressed.”  
Brown said in the complaintthat
he continually spoke with faculty
about his interest in the tenured
position, citing his experience in

V tax law, speciﬁcally mentioning

that he received Pitt’s School-of
Law’s annual outstanding teach-
ing award threetimes. L

Student leaders attended their
last summer camp complete with
_campﬁres and s’mores before re-

turning to school, except thisone ,

provided a learning opportunity
as well. . C . -

The second annual Panther
Global Oriented Leadership Devel-

opment (GOLD) Retreat brought_

together student organizations’
executive board leaders, Student
Government Board, the Division
of Student Affairs and Pitt admin-
istrators to develop and expand
upon leadership skills. The retreat
is funded by the Division of Stu-
dent Affairs.

About 65 leaders boarded buses
outside of the William Pitt Union
Friday at 9 a.m. and traveled to
Camp Kon-0-Kwee/Spencer, a
YMCA summer camp for children,
located about 45 minutes away
from campus in Fombell, Pa. The
group returned to campus 5 p.m.
Saturday. 5

SGB president Molly Stieber
said that helping the new execu-

tive board leaders understand the

V SGB budget allocation process was

one of the main focuses of the re-
treat. V

Stieber began emailing campus
leaders at the end of May about
attending the retreat.

She said SGB and Student Af-
fairs decided what groups to email
based on the size of the groups and
how much money they received
last yearin funding from SGB. Stie-
ber said that most of the organiza-
tions in attendance were those that
consistently ask SGB for funding
during the school year. i

ciety, Keep It Real and Pitt STAND
were among some of the 30 or-
ganizations represented, Stieber
said. .
According to the itinerary, seg-
ments presented by SGB to student
organizations included “SORC 101/
Allocations/Reservations” and
“Role of SGB,” which outlined the

organization of SGB and the alloca— ’

tions process.

But the retreat was not just all A.

business and no play. The sched-
ule said that attendees also got to
enjoy a “drum circle” and partici-

, pate in “free time” activities such

as making s’mores.

jamie'Levine, president of Pitt-’s ’
 STAND, avstudent--anti—gen0cide 

coalition, attended her ﬁrst GOLD
retreat this weekend. She said it
was a great way to meet people
from other organizations.

“I think it deﬁnitely opened

5 up the door with SGB in terms of

having conversations and asking
questions,” Levine said. “I deﬁ-
nitely think [SGB members] were
available and a lot of people found
that helpful.”

SGB board member Ryan Gay-
man said the retreat provided an
open dialogue with student orga-
nizations. , ’

“It was a good time for students
to organically meet. When you get
several of the organizations under
one neutral space, where no one is
on a higher level than the other,

. thereiwas open communication

and feedback,” Gayman said.
SGB board memberjames Lan-
dreneau was also pleased with the
retreat proceedings. He said the
retreat had a “very positive at-
mosphere” and was a beneﬁcial
environment for student groups to
better understand not only alloca-

_ tions, but how SGB operates.

Landreneau and .Gayman ac-

-knowledged that student"-groups

often feel intimidated when asking
for funding. _
“Sometimes people think of us

almost like the administration,

when we are students,” Gayman
said. .

Gayman noted that SGB’s du-
ties encompass many other aspects
besides solely allocations.

“Allocations is afraction of our
role at Pitt,” Gayman said. “We’re
here to empower students, and I
think this retreat will help people
with opening lines of communica-
tion and makingpeople feel wel-
come with us this fall.”,

‘Shelbi Pellen, advertising direc-
tor of Pitt Program Council, said
the retreat was a “great experi-
ence.”

“It was a wonderful opportu-
nity for PPC to network with other

- organizations and you could tell

SGB wanted to get to know us bet-
ter. I think our relationship will be
better now than before,” Pellen

said. “They have become more ap— A

proachable.”

Red Cross provides tips onhandling natural disasters

Amy Friedenberger
- Assistant News Editor

Pittsburgh has had its fair share ,

of natural hazards this year, in-
cluding thunderstorms, ﬂoods,
snowstorms and now an earth-
quake

Earlier this month, heavy
rain, hail storms and subse-
quent ﬂooding washed through
the area, resulting in four deaths.
Last week, a 5.8 magnitude earth-
quake, centered 84 miles south-
west of Washington, D.C. shook
parts of Maryland, Pennsylvania,
Delaware and New Jersey in the
afternoon. .

The natural disaster left Pitts-
burgh authorities inspecting
potential damages and humani-
tarian organizations reminding
people of what to do in the case
of another disaster. L

During the earthquake, people
in Pittsburgh — mostly those in
buildings —were able to feel shak-
ing for about 20 seconds. Pitt’s
seismographs at the Allegheny

Observatory showed the quake
still registering 30 minutes later.

William Harbert, a geophysicist
at Pitt, said the accumulated
stress from a force on the North
American plate resulted in stress
on the plate, which the fault
couldn’t handle any longer.

' “It’s like stretching a rubber

band,” Harbert said. “You stretch '

it enough and it will eventually
break.”

Harbert said the earthquake,
which occurred at the Central
Virginia Seismic Zone, released
about 11 kilotons of energy, which
he equated to about 11,000 tons
of dynamite.

Prior to last week, the larg-
est earthquake felt in Western
Pennsylvania occurred on Sept.

j 25, 1998, measuring in at a 5.3

magnitude.
State of roads and bridges
Following the earthquake,
the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation inspected bridges
and roads for any damage.
Pittsburgh PennDOT spokes-

It's like stretching a rubber band.
You stretch it enough and it will A
A eventually break.

—William Harbert    

man Steve Cowan said that the
earthquake did not damage any
roads.

“We have no reason to be-
lieve the Virginia earthquake

caused major damage to any state -
roadways or bridges,” said Scott —

Christie, PennDOT’s Deputy
Secretary for Highway Admin-

, istration in a press release last

Tuesday. “But to err on the side
of caution, we are assessing those
bridges that could be susceptible
to quake damage.”

Cowan said that in District 11, '

99.

which is made up of Allegheny,
Beaver and Lawrence counties,
all bridges built with rocker
bearings that are at least 200
feet long and 60 feet high were
inspected.

“There are no issues,” he
said.

Before the earthquake, on Au-

gust 19, a flash ﬂood that over-
whelmed the storm water system
overtook parts. of Pittsburgh.
The rain overﬂowed the two
largest sewers on Washington
Boulevard during the rain-

storm. in ' ’
The Pittsburgh Water‘ and
Sewer Authority released a state-
ment last week regarding the
ﬂooding, saying that the drains‘

were unclogged following a July T

18 storm.
The statement went on to say
that the drainswere cleared of

dirt and rocks again the night V‘
of the August 19 storm and the —

following day.
‘ Three-step disaster plan
-Lauren Chapman, a spokes-
woman for the American Red
Cross in -Pittsburgh, said that
there are three steps that people
should take to make sure they
are preparedfor any natural di-
saster.’ . , '
9 She said people should keep
an emergency kit in their house
and car that includes a three-
day food supply, water, clothing,
ﬂashlight, ﬁrst aid kit, blanket,
batteries, important paperwork,
phone numbers and cash in case
the power goes out and ATMs are
unavailable.

25 robbed the victim at gunpoint.
The suspects ﬂed on foot toward
McKee Place.

At 12:23 a.m. Thursday, three
African—American males between
19 and 23 years old robbed a vic-
tim at gunpoint near 278 N. Belle-

ﬁeld Ave., past the Webster Hall
Apartments near Centre Avenue.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
said the victims were three stu-
dents and did not report any in-
juries.

Fedele confirmed that Pitt
police are currently working
with Carnegie Mellon police and
Pittsburgh police torinvestigate
the incidents."

Extra patrol cars have been
positioned around Oakland in

Freshmen officially welcomed to University

Amy Friedenberger
Assistant News Editor

Molly Stieber said that she remembered
sitting where the freshmen sat Wednesday
at Convocation four years ago, wearing an
oversized Holland Hall T-shirt.

Stieber, now a senior and SGB president,
addressed Pitt’s freshman class on Wednes-
day at the annual Freshman Convocation at
the Petersen Events Center, an event that
marks the official beginning of the incoming
class’s time at Pitt. Various administrators
also joined in welcoming the new under-
graduate class.

Provost and Senior Vice Chancellor Pa-
tricia Beeson opened the ceremony at 3
p.m., saying that Convocation is one of a
great number of traditions at Pitt.

“We’ve been welcoming students for 225
years,” Beeson said. “They’ve made their
mark on this institution, as I expect your
class will.” ,

More than 3,000 freshmen attended the
hour-long convocation. Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg said they come from 47 states
and 14 countries.

“We’ve come a long way from having one
teacher teaching a handful of students in a
log cabin,” Nordenberg said.

Nordenberg said the school’s 225th an-
niversary will be celebrated Feb. 28, 2012.

The event will offer a day to -acknowledge
the many achievements of past classes, He
said he hopedthese achievements would
continue with this year’s class.

He cited Pitt’s scholarship recipients,
including three Rhodes Scholars, ﬁve Mar-
shall and Truman scholars and 22 Goldwater
scholars, who have come from previous
classes.

“I know achievements will come from _

this group,” Nordenberg said.

Stieber said that Pitt not only excels in V

academics, but at athletics and programs
like as the Pitt Study Abroad Ofﬁce — which
she urged freshmen to take advantage of
while at Pitt.

“You don’t want to look back on college

and wish you’d done something different,”
Stieber said. '

Freshman Laura Liebers said that Stie-
ber’s advice to become involved resonated
with her. Coming from the small town of
Niskayuna, N.Y., she said she’s excited to
explore the city of Pittsburgh and all of the
opportunites the University has to offer.

Vice Provost and Dean of Students Kathy
Humphrey followed Nordenberg, express-
ing her eagerness to add on‘ a new under-
graduate class. She also let the parents know
that their children are in good hands.

SGB members outline plansat summer meeting

Amy Friedenberger
Assistant News Editor

The Student Government Board held its
annual summer meeting last week, after a
number of members returned from study-

ing abroad.

Seven of the nine Board members attended
the constitutionally-mandated summer meet-
ing, held in the conference room in the back
of the SGB office in the William Pitt Union on
Tuesday, where they outlined their initiatives
for the year.

Board President Molly Stieber brought up
the annual Panther GOLD Retreat that took
place Saturday and Sunday at Camp Kon-
O-Kwee, where representatives from many
student organizations attended lectures and
workshops including “Being a Persuasive
Leader,” a lecture by director of student life
Kenyon Bonner, and “Role of SGB,” where
the Board outlined information and the goals
of SGB.

The GOLD Retreat is free to members of
student organizations, and it is an initiative
through SGB and the Division of Student Af-
fairs.

Stieber, who spent the summer in_Prague,
listed about 20 student organizations that
would have members in attendance.

“It’s organizations we see all the time ask-
ing for money,” Stieber said.

Board member Alex Zimmerman, who
spent the summer in Pittsburgh, has been
working on numerous initiatives that he
brought up at the meeting. _

He said that the graduate exam resource
center, located in the Alldred Collection of the
Cup 8: Chaucer Cafe of the Hillman Library, is
now open for student use.

The area will include study books for

graduate school exams, including the LSAT,
GRE, MCAT and GMAT. Several of the books
are also available as eBooks, which students
can access through PI'ITcat, the online catalog
of University libraries. 1 . V

Zimmerman said that he is continuing dis-
cussions with the Pitt administration about an
‘alcohol amnesty policy at Pitt. He has been
meeting with various administrative groups
since last spring, when the issue of an amnesty
policy at Pitt became a big topic on campus.

Board member Ryan Gayman brought up
an initiative that suggested adjusting SGB
chair positions. _ L

“We should think about getting the en-
vironmental chair as something around for
good, and not as an ad hoc,” Gayman said.

0 Creatinga new-chair of a standing com-
mittee would require changing the bylaws. A
chair provides additional resources for the
board.’ ” my " .

The Board members discussedthe pos-
sibility of holding a referendum for Gayman’s
idea, which Gayman said can be voted on at
any time, not just during elections. The Board

just needs to have a majority vote from non-
College of General Studies students.

Stieber said that she has completed the
major goals she wanted to accomplish while
in ofﬁce. Those goals included working with
the Book Center to introduce electronic text-
books, making the allocatiqns process clearer
for students and defending students against
budget cuts.

“My goal now is to help every one of you to
get your goals accomplished,” Stieber said.

Board members Matt Riehle andjohn Has-
ley did not attend the meeting because they
weren’t yet back in Pittsburgh.

Allocations:

No allocations were put through for Tues-
day’s meeting, but severalihave been submit-
ted for the nextvrneeting. Because one was
time—sensitive, the board voted on it at last,
week’smeeting. V r '7 e_ -

The Biomedical Engineering Society re-
quested‘ $2,000 to send four students to a
conference. The Society submitted that it
would pay the registration fees for one of the
students. The Board approved the request. I_

The University Center for Social and Urban

The yet-to-be-named dorm will hold retail

and the University Counseling Center, cur-

back in March. ‘

Shorak also said previously that inthefall of ‘
2012, there willbe 7,400 beds on campus. That
number represents about 44 percent of Pitt’s
undergraduate, full—time student population.
The numbers will continue to increase in the
fall of 2013 with the opening of the new dorm.
Forty—seven percent of full—time Pitt students
will have access to on-campus housing.

ward upper campus.

“I wasn’t planning on going,” freshman
Dean Zaslow said. “But then I saw a group
of people on my ﬂoor in Towers leaving
for the fair, and I joined in.”

The event was previously hosted in
Posvar Hall, but a lack of adequate space
prompted the decision to move the event
from Posvar to the Pete.

’ “The event just grew to be too large
for Posvar,” said Gina Scozzaro, business
manager at SORC. “The number of or-
ganizations in the fair have been pretty

much the same for the last three or four.

years. We’ve pretty much maxed out the
space we are in.”

' — Many students who had attended past
fairs felt the move from Posvar to the Pete
was a good choice.

“I think Posvar was much more ‘in your
face,’” senior Maria Gerardi said. “It’s so
much better here. It’s not as congested.”

Cornerstone Church members took the
biblical advice “Seek, and you shall find”
to heart. They used some “super” help,
employing Spider—Man, Batman and the
Black Power Ranger to hand out ﬂiers ad-
vertising their church located across from
Litchfield Towers.

“People like_ to” take ﬂiers fromASpi—
der-Man, They’re like, ‘I can’t say no to
Spider—Man,”’ said the masked, crusader,

I

who. told The Pitt Newsunder the condi- «

tion of anonymity that his true identity
is Peter Parker. . . V . -
Cornerstone wasn’t the only club
that used costumes to catch students’
eyes. V '
The captains of Steel City Bhangra, an
Indian-style dance team, wore their Vardi
dance costumes to the fair. Captain Sid

Pandit, who donned bright yellow and
bejeweled garb with a matching hat, said
the costume was successful in attracting
students to the team’s booth. I A .
The traditional method of free swag
to pull in the passersbyiwas in full effect.
Organizations handed out pens,- shirts,
bags and other superﬂuous —- but always
welcome — giveaways. Many students,
though not solely attending the fair for the
free items, were pleased by the prospect
of picking up free accoutrements fortheir
dorm rooms. 5
“I wanted to see what other people

were interested in, to look at different’

types of engineering clubs and clubs out-
side of engineering, too. I want to be well-

-rounded,” freshman Zachary Smith said.

“Free stuff is also nice.”
‘Some groups were creative with
their giveaways. Pittsburgh Fencing As-

sociation member Kayla Thomason cre-'

ated and passed out balloon-art swords

to students checking out her club’s table

outside on the upper plaza. ’ ' .
Nearby,.life imitated art as the Chinese

Martial Arts Association displayed real ‘

swords. -

“It’s amazing,” member David Tringali
said. “The crowd that will gather to see
shiny and bright things.”

The club presented sparring and sword

demonstrations on a mat seto'_n the out— .

door plaza level. - .
When the fair ended; many students
said they felt pleased with their sign—ups
for the day;
“I signed up for everything that inter-
ested me,” freshman Yaleh Asadi said.
“Now it’s just a matter of what I’ll show

up for.”

New state lawsparked Pitt policy change

Amnesty < 1

prosecution and initiation of Pitt
Judicial Board action if the stu-
dent fulﬁlls requirements similar
to the law — contacts emergency
services by calling the Pitt police

or 911 to report an incident, re-'

mains with the person who needs
emergency services, cooperates
with emergency ofﬁcials, meets
with appropriate University of-
ficials after the incident and
cooperates with any University
investigation.

Before Pennsylvania passed
the law, Pitt had a zero—tolerance
policy toward alcohol and no am-
nesty policy. ’ -

Pitt Police commander Franci
Walsh said last year that ‘if we

come in contact with someone

under the age of 21, and if they

' have consumed alcohol, they

will get cited. It’s not harsh. It’s
the law.”.Last spring, the Student
Government Board members be-

gan meeting with the University’s .

Alcohol Task Force, comprised of
students and administration of-
ficials, to discuss the possibility
of reversing the policy. ’

Anna Vitriol, a health educator
at Pitt’s Student Health Service,
directed questions to Pitt spokes-
woman Patricia White. White said
that it is still too early to say how
the state amnestypolicy and the
change to Pitt’s policy will af-

fect the role of the Alcohol Task.

Force. g

Carnegie Mellon University
and_ Temple_University both al-
ready had alcohol amnesty poli-
cies in place before the law was
enacted. CMU’-s, policy has broad-
er protections, granting amnesty

to both the students who seek .l
medical attention after drinking‘

underage and for the students
who call University police or the
EMS for the intoxicated person.

State Sen. _1ohn Rafferty, R-
Montgomery, the original spon-
sor of the Senate bill, said that he
hopes this bill will help in situa-
tions where underage drinking
is involved and someone needs
medical attention.

“Rather than someone run-
ning from the scene,‘someone

, will say, ‘Wait a minute, this isn’t

right. This person should get at-
tention,”’ Rafferty said. “This
[law] will initiate the work to get
that person the medical attention
they need.”

But neither the law nor the
Student Code of Conduct grants

\

the responsibility.”

He said that the possibility
of the intoxicated person get-
ting in trouble will hopefully
not make people second—guess
calling emergency services. The
law is “appealing to the good con-

  Someone will say, ‘wait a

minute, this isn’t right.’  _

amnesty to the person who needs
the medical attention.-

Rafferty said he felt that the
the person calling emergency
services should receive amnesty

— because “they’re the one taking A

S -State Sen. John Rafferty

science to make sure [people] do
the right thing.” ’ A

The new Universityprotocol
states that “the Responsible Ac-

tion Protocol only applies to‘al- I
cohol violations and does not

apply to other criminal activity
such as assault, property dam-
age or presence of other illicit
substances.”

But the Code of Conduct states
that when student organizations
are hosting an event, they are ex-

pected to call emergency services
in an alcohol-related emergency,
but they may not be exempt from
judicial consequences resulting
from student code violations.
Rafferty has worked on this
bill for ainumber of years, and

' ,said he is happy to see it ﬁnally

signed into law. The bill ran two
years ago under Gov. Ed Rendell
andpassed in the state Senate but
not the House. _' r ‘

This time around, the bill
passed unanimously in the Sen-
ate and Houseinjune before Gov.
Tom Corbett signed it into law
on July 7.

“This law is a step in the right
direction to encourage young

people to assume their respon-'

sibility and make the effort to

help someone in need,” Rafferty V A

said. . ‘ ‘

always persevere.

“Unexpected encounters in your path
have profound effects,” she said.

After the speakers, the alumnae stood
up and students filed toward the front to
have the alumnae’s ﬂames transferred to

' their lanterns’ candles.

Many freshmen in attendance said they
chose to come to the event because they
wished to be part of a Pitt tradition.

Freshman Ariel Cohen said that a sense
of sisterhood pervaded Lantern Night.

“It’s-a Pitt tradition. -They’ve been doing — «.

it for so long,” she said.

Mariah Wolk, sitting next to Cohen,
added that the free lantern was a good
bonus.

“The lantern is a nice keepsake,” she
said.

The Alumnae Council and Student Af-
fairs co—sponsored Lantern Night.

Laraine.Hlatky, of the Alumni Relations
and Development Office, helped coordi-
nate the event. She has helped organize
Lantern Night for 15 years and said prepa-
ration starts in June, when the lanterns
are ordered. ' .

Kathy Fitch attended_to watch her
freshman daughter participate in the
event. She said she thought it was nice to
have an event just for Pitt women.

“I think it’s a neat thing,” she said. “I
came from Penn State, and we never did
anything likethis.”- »— » . A -I    .  ..

Another mother and alumna, Eileen‘
Barney, stood to watch the lantern light-
ing. Barney graduated from Pitt in 1981
and now has a junior and freshman daugh-
ter attending the University. '

“I encouraged her to come to Lantern
Night,” Barney said. “It’s a great honor

in last week.

As a result of the rapid inﬂux of returning
students, Pitt’s Department of Parking and
Transportation shut down Bigelow Boulevard,

A Lothrop Street and University Drive B. All roads
' were reopened by Friday

On the ﬁrst move-in day, Shawn Brooks, di-
rector of Residence Life, stood in the center of
Schenley Quad observingthefreefood and festivi-
ties for the newcomers.

“It’s goingreally, really smoothly,” he said, glad
that the previous week’s power outage didn’t ne-
peat itself. “Can you imagine ifthe powerwould’ve
been out?” Brooks said cars began lining up on
Forbes and Fifth Avenues as early as 6:30 am
Tuesday. .

“Some of them are kind of cranky from wait-
ing, but for the most part it’s not ba ” junior Ar-
rival Survival volunteer Emily Eagleton said.

Eagletonalso directed traﬁic onFiﬁ:hAvenue
during her shift. She said the team of students lin-
ingthe roadinneonye1lowArrival Survival shirts
occasionally knocked on carwindows welcoming
the new students to the University.

“They all seem eager to talk to us,” she said.

Sophomore volunteerEvaFitch said she heard
some complaints about traﬂic, but most of the
parents and students in attendance were over-
powered with excitement and curiosity.

“It’s tough, but everyone is happy to be here,”

   

she said. .

On the hill, few complainm were heard about
the move-in days.

Freshman Chyna Golden moved into the sixth
ﬂoor of Sutherland East on Wednesday after-
noon. A

Golden stayed on campus for a portion of the
summer to train with Pitt’s women’s basketball
team. She said she kept most other items in stor-
age in preparation for her August move-in and
the restwere put into bins and driven from New
Jersey. "

“We had no problems with the elevators,” she
said, joking that movinginwith herfatherwould
have been less than pleasant if the elevators had
malﬁmclioned.

OCC overhaul
 hit-or-miss

Many returning students, preoc-
cupied with earthquakes and tu-
ition hikes, could easily miss some
of the more subtle developments
that have occurred at Pitt since the .
spring semester. Those hoping for
a green cord come graduation day,
however, would do well to take a
closer look.

This past summer, Pitt’s Outside
the Classroom Curriculum, or OCC,
underwent a thorough reworking
— with decidedly mixed results.
Now, among other changes, nine
of the 10 “goal areas” (the 10th,
“Demonstrating Initiative and
Drive,” is new and open-ended)
feature a few mandatory require-
ments and a minimum number of
electives. Upon successful comple-
tion of every category, students are
eligible for induction into the OCC
Honorary Society, whose beneﬁts
include exclusive meetings with
potential employers.

Although we applaud some of
these changes —— the diminished
number of curriculum _items,
many of which were superﬂuous,
is a major improvement —— we’re
concerned others might be detri-
mental to both OCC credit-seekers
and the campus at large.

Foremost, there’s the require-
ment that participants vote in at
least one SGB election during their
undergraduate years — a measure
we ﬁnd counter-productive. Rather
than selecting candidates based on
prior research, aspiring Honorary
Society members might choose a
name at random to earn the req-
uisite Pitt Pride points. After all, -
the program offers no incentive to
understand each of the candidates’
positions — only one to press the

“vote” button. .

More troubling still is the
stipulation that Pitt students at-
tend Emerging Leaders or “alter-
nate leadership training” (which,
according to spokesman Shawn
Ahearn, includes RA training or
programs provided for fraternities
or sororities) for a minimum of 20
hours. For many people, especially
those already saddled with aca-

, demic or professional obligations,

this is an unrealistic commitment.
It could also be an expensive one,
if students were tochoose to par-
ticipate in the Emerging Leaders

program itself, which costs $60. A

The most upsetting new feature
of OCC, however, is the networking
community that all Pitt students
should enjoy, but will instead be
offered exclusively to Honorary
Society members. As mentioned,
various employers will be invited

to speak with members of the so— '

ciety, and the society only. In other
words, our tuition money, which
funds the OCC program, will chan-
nel beneﬁts to ‘a select number of
students; those students who, for
whatever reason, cannot complete
all 10 goal areas will be deprived of
a valuable career service.

OCC’s central tenants -— com-
munity involvement, personal de-
velopment and career preparation
—-— are easy to support. But some
of the requirements the new cur-
riculum imposes run counter to ev-
eryone’s interests. Students should
vote in the SGB elections, they
should hone their leadership skills
and they should meet with employ-
ers — but not at the behest of the
University. Some extracurriculars
are best left extracurricular. 

 

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

 

Our absent president

 

The president of the United States
is arguably the most recogniz-
able person in the world. Though
we are routinely treated to vid-
eos of people on the street who
don’t know who the speaker of the
House is or who can’t name ﬁve
Supreme Court justices,gI would
be willing to bet a whole round
of quantitative easing that most
people know who the president
IS.

Granted, they might not know
exactly what his powers and re-

Mark Kozlowski sponsibilities are, but the guy’s

there are an awful lot of people

, who don’t know exactly what it is

that the president ‘is doing, and
I’m one of them.

Andrew Kaback
Columnist

When I was little, my family went »

on vacation in Philadelphia. As
a big supporter of the American
Revolution, my only regret was
that I had but one week to give
the city. I loved Philadelphia. Un-
fortunately, there was one major
problem. You guessed it: Everyone .
called pop “soda.” ‘

At the time, I didn’t think it

was that big of a deal. I thought 
to ‘call ﬁzzy beverages ‘‘sodas.’’
’ .C’mon, I have standards!

 . I :don’t understand why it’s_

something off about its preferred‘;  

vocabulary. ..
When I came to Pitt, it seemed
like everybody Iimet was from

arguments for the word soda. I

claim Philadelphia as a hometown

‘The.1_-more that   

 

my new friends from the East,
the more I realized they had a
different perspective on reality.

To them, making.the NFC Cham.-.

pionship for consecutive years and
being in the ﬁnals of the Stanley
Cup never ended well. Cheez Whiz
was considered cuisine and “It’s
Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and
Tina Fey somehow made the city
a second Hollywood.

Although some of their hab-
its came to be understandable, it
has remained clear to me that I
couldn’t follow their lead and start

even: an argument. Saying soda

utsidepthev Mid-

 

‘ exact same ﬁve points». they con-

tinuously pull out of their bag of '

ignorance. They are as follows:

Why thank you, Marilyn

Monroe, for letting me know what

a current college student know
what it was like in the ’50s? Who
told you about the hip lingo of back
in the day? I read “The Catcher in
the Rye” too, and I still say pop.
The only  ’I’ll buy this argument
is if you have a DeLorean parked
out back that I can hop into.

2) Who says pop?

I do! Really? Was that supposed
to work? Everybody that defends

saying the word soda eventually
asks this question when arguing.
It makesabsolutely zero sense. If
you are arguing about it, there is

_ clearly a large contingent of.peo—

pie. who say pop. Either you are
completely failing at belittling my
viewpoint or actually lack brain
cells. Either way, it makes you
sound even dumber.

3) If people on the East Coast
say soda, it has to be right.

Look: The Statue of Liberty is
awesome and Ben Franklin was a
cool guy, but unless I want some
challah or a cheesesteak, this argu-
ment just doesn’t ﬂy. I’m not go-
ing to get into the “real America”
debate  but we all know it’s the
Midwest. George Washington was,
all aboutfreedom and all, but he
also owned slaves. You know who
was about true freedom? Abraham
Lincoln —— proud Midwesterner!

No, there is no comeback.

4) Wawa is so much better than Sheetz.

As stated in point No. 3, people who say
soda entrench themselves in a battle for East
Coast supremacy. For some reason, they
believe this ﬁght extends to  gas stations?
If there is anything that soda-ites defend
more than soda, it is Wawa. The second
that I say pop, I am immediately labeled
a “Sheetz person.” I mean, I’ve been to a
Sheetz. I think I bought some chips there
once. They were OK. I’m still confused.

5) Pop is a music genre.

My personal favorite has to be this one.
It’s true: I do usually confuse Pepsi and Coke
with Britney Spears and Lady Gaga (to be
fair, they’re equally interesting rivalries);

music genre

This argument is like screaming at a bar-
tender that you just can’t drink a borough of
New York City. And let’s be honest, if there
were a music genre called soda, it would
probably be awful.

I can’t say for sure which way this battle
will sway. Unfortunately, like the hordes of
Mordor, the soda-ites continue to multiply
and don’t seem to understand the error of
their ways.

I do have hope though; I believe in a
world’ where pop is the sole term used to
describe this carbonated beverage. And I
believe that you can take up the ﬁght with
me and, together, we can win this‘ country
back.‘ But for the last line, let’s ﬁnd some

’ common ground: At least they don’t call

it all Coke. 

Kozlowski < 32

They accuse John Boehner of selling out
to Obama and the Democrats. Democrats
are busy screaming about how Obama sold
out to Boehner and the Republicans, and
they aren’t happy about the deal because
it might end up cutting beneﬁts without
raising taxes on the wealthy.

The deal that everybody is complaining
about was not a result of the well—publi—
cized bargaining between Boehner, Obama
and other members of Congress. Those
talks fell apart when everybody accused
everybody else of refusing to compromise.
The bill everyone hates was instead a re-
sult of back—room dealings between House
Republicans and Senate Democrats, a bill
that was put together in a matter of days
instead of over the course of weeks of ne-
gotiations.

The lack of leadership from the White
House on this debt issue manifests itself
in three ways. First, while Obama was per-
, fectly willing to obstruct the Republican

plans, he offered no substantial plan of his.
own. Second, the deal that was ultimately
enacted was something Obama had to re-
act to, not an event that he helped shape.
Third, the White House was largely left out
of the loop on the deal House Republicans
cut with congressional Democrats, sug-
gesting that those on the Hill put more faith
in the ability of the whips in the House and
Senate to push a plan through than they
did in the White House to accomplish the
same task. In other words, the Republicans
guessed — correctly, as it turned out '—
that Democrats in Congress would be able
to force the President’s hand more that
vice—versa, suggesting that the president
might not even be in charge of his own

Health care plan botched

party anymore.

The shortage of leadership is not even
especially recent. The signature legislative
accomplishment of the Obama adminis-
tration, health care reform, also saw the
president surprisingly absent. Remember?
There were two plans that were ﬂoating
around, one from the House and one from
the Senate. But which was “the Obama
plan”? From all the noise the White House
was making, it seemed like any plan that
would clear both houses would get Obama’s
signature. This was a bad idea for several
reasons. First, Obama was not able to bring
to bear the political capital he had because
the health reform was seen as an exercise
in legislative logrolling instead of the per-
sonal interest of the president. This meant
that the plan proceeded through Congress

.very slowly, allowing the opposition to

reorganize. Second, when Obama was not
leading, he was a lightning rod for criticism
of elements of both the House and Senate
bills, since both of those could plausibly be
said to contain elements for which Obama
was rooting. So Obama started losing po-
litical capital in the least worthwhile man-
ner possible — waiting for any bill to clear
Congress and cross his desk. Whatever
you think of Obamacare, the White House
handled it very poorly.

With the 2012 election season about to
begin, Americans are going to be Voting for
someone to occupy the most visible office
in the land. It is unfortunate that the of-
ﬁce’s incumbent has been largely invisible,

-especially when this country especially

needs his leadership.

Pitt head coach Sue—Moy Chin said
that Kephart always showed interest in
coaching.

Olympic Trials

Staﬁ‘ Writer

Before they had a chance to don the

‘ Panther blue and gold, four new

Pitt swimmers earned the right
to compete for an opportunity to
wear the red, white and blue.

In the past three months,
incoming freshman swimmers
Kourosh Ahani,’ Austin Caldwell,
Jonathan Lierley and Luke Nos-
bisch recorded times under the
U.S. Olympic Trial standards,
making them eligible to swim in
the 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials next
summer.

“We are extremely impressed ‘

with the qualifying swims of these
"four athletes,” Pitt head coach
Chuck Knoles said. “You are con-
sidered lucky if you get one or two
such performances, but to have
four already —— and from our new
freshmen — is unheard of.”

cruiting class has been heralded 1

as one of the nation’s best, earning

Summer Nationals in May. He

While Ahani had success in his
100 meter event, his roommate
and fellow recruit Lierley, who

comes to Pitt from Mount -Pleas- «

ant, S.C., turned in a trial-qualify-
ing performance of his own in the
200-meter butterﬂy with a time of
2:01.81 at the Senior Sectionals in
Georgia.

“I had a really good feeling go-
ing into that swim,”-Lierley said.
“I wanted to go for the qualifying
time, and it ‘was great to accom-
plish it.” '

Caldwell, fromlLove1and, Ohio,
recorded a personal-best time of
23.45 in the 50-meter. freestyle

race at the U.S. Swimming Sec-
tionals.  *

The fourth new Panther to" ‘
‘ qualify for the U.S. Olympic tri-

als, Monroeville-, Pa.,-native
Nosbisch, earned his place with
a 2:20.22 ﬁnish in the 200-meter
breaststroke at the Charlotte Ul-
traSwim event.

. Knoles sees the four qualifying "I ‘
swims as a validation of the top- "

25 distinction from CollegeSwim-

recruiting strength of his staff.

Ahani will live with fellow but-

FOOTBALL

Sheard successful in
jump to NFL  

Dustin Gabler
Staﬂ’ Writer

Former Pitt defensive endjabaal Sheard
didn’t let the NFL lockout hamper his
rookie season. .—

Instead, Sheard got a head start in
preparing for the’ professional level,
working out with some of his new Cleve-
land Browns teammates and several free
agents during the summer. ~—

“Two or three guys ended up on the
team with me and ﬁt in well,” Sheard said.

“It was nice coming in and knowing some A

veteran guys.”

Sheard was selected asCleveland’s
second round pick, and Baylor’s standout
defensive tackle, Phil Taylor, was taken
in the first round.

He came to Pitt from Hollywood Hills,
Fla. and racked up 52 tackles, 14.5 tackles
for loss, nine sacks, four forced fumbles
and a fumble recovery during his senior
season. .

It was enough to catch the Cleveland
Browns’ attention in the second round.

“I was in Florida with my family and
my agent at the house. The 36"‘ pick came
up, and I got the phone call from Cleve-
land,” Sheard said. “My mom was scream-
ing aﬁd crying. I couldn’t come right up
to Cleveland to meet everyone, but it was
still a great experience.”

NFLDraftScout.com writer Rob Rang
predicted before the draft that Sheard
would adjust well to the NFL, Writing
that Sheard “will be more productive

as a rookie than at least a few of the ’

more highly touted defensive ends of

It's great to have another rookie onthe

defensive line with me.We're going ,

through all the same problems together.
4 —Jabaal Sheard

The two rookies have worked hard
throughout camp and the preseason to
all but assure them a place on the starting
defensive line when they take the field
against their in-state rival, the Cincinnati
Bengals, on September 11.

Sheard is ﬁrst on the Browns’ depth
chart at right defensive end with third
year player Marcus Benard listed on the
second team.]ayme Mitchell, a fifth year
player out of Mississippi, will start at left
defensive end. ' -

Former Penn State player Scott Paxson
will back up Taylor at defensive tackle
with fourth year player Ahtyba Rubin
also starting at defensive tackle.

‘‘’It’s great to have another rookie on
the defensive line with me,” Sheard said.
“We’re going through all the same prob-
lems together. A lot of the stuff is just
refreshing since we both come from 4-3
defenses. We are at the same pace, and
we help each other when we can.”

Sheard, the 36”‘ overall pick in the NFL
draft, was the 2010 Big East Defensive
Playerof the Year — the fifth Panther
since 2006 towin the award. , , , V

as    

this draft.” _
Cleveland’s head coach, Phil Shurmur,
has been impressed with Sheard’s perfor-
mance at the professional level so far.
“He’s been very steady, steadier
than you might expect from arookie,
in terms of just generally playing well.
That’s good,” Shurmursaid in a press
conference during training camp. “He’s
like anybody right now. He’s tired and
sore. We like to think when he gets his
legs freshened for a game situation, he’ll
be more explosive. He’s doing well.”
Some of the Browns’ veteran players

have helped Sheard adjust to playing at '

the next level. A ,

“We’re around a lot of veterans here,”
Sheard said. “Those guys teach" us small
techniques and a lot of stuff thatthey
have picked up on duringftheir career.”

But the biggest help for Sheard doesn’t
come from the defensive side of the
ball. V .

Lierley said. “I can deﬁnitely see it making
us both better swimmers.”

Knoles agrees with this idea and fore-
sees that sense of competition pervading
his whole team. I

“With incoming freshmen posting UJS.- _

qualifying times this early on, the bar is re-
ally raised for all of the swimmers, including

' upperclassmen,” Knoles said. “It presentsa

challenge to each member of the team to im-
prove and work harder during the year.”- _

Caldwell already overcame a challenge
before stepping foot on-Pitt’s campus’ as he
managed to put up a qualifying time even
after missing most of the spring season due

coming season, which starts in October.

swims were in four different events, the
breadth of competition among the team-

_ “We have a lot of parts in place, including
our impressive new recruits, to make a lot of
improvements this year,” Knoles said. “Our

Last year, the men’s team ﬁnished third in
