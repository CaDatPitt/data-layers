Trust Money Use Challenged Dr. Whitman Appointed

BY JOHN POULIN

Current construction of the
Gardner Steel Conference Center,
under ﬁnance by a trust fund willed
to the University, has provoked
complaints by Pitt undergraduate
Larry Chaban.

The Conference Center is a
renovation project involving the
Old Dental Clinic Building located
on the corner of Thackeray and
O’Hara Streets across from ‘Bene-
dum auditorium.

The Center includes plans for
conference rooms, banquet facili-
ties, and an already completed area
for the Faculty Club, which is
relocating from the 17th floor of the
Cathedral. -

Construction began after the
University was notified that a trust
fund left by former Pitt alumnus
Gardner Steel could not be held
indeﬁnitely.
worth of the fund was approxi-

'mately $340,000.

Steel, who was a 100-yard dash
champion when he attended Pitt,
speciﬁed in his will that the money
should be used for construction of a
“chapel, library, recitation hall,
lecture hall, or other building of
‘equal importance,” and that the
facility should bear his name.

Vice-Chancellor of Operations
Joseph Dutton then recommended
the money be spent on the
Conference Center and University
trustees voted their approval.

“I personally made the recom-
mendation myself. "But it was a
decision by the Chancellor that the
University was in need of confer-
ence facilities on campus.“

The accumulated ,

Dutton pointed out that the
University must currently rent
conference rooms from places
outside the University such as
Webster Hall. The Conference
Center would‘ eliminate such
expenditures.

“Ideally,” he said, “it will be a
conference center for the entire
academic family.” And because it
will be extensively used by the
faculty,“ “We will have a better
coordinated University. There will
be a cross-fertilization of ideas
from all departments because they
have the facility for this.” ‘ a

Freshman Larry Chaban has
sharply criticized the project
because of the specially-built room
for the Faculty Club, which was
given first priority in the renovation
and for which over $100,000 of the
redeemed trust was spent.

Chaban, who described the
completed Faculty Club as looking

like a “night club,” feels the

money was misspent by a few in

the interest of themselves, “while

student facilities of this type are
either nonexistent or inadequate.”
The Student Union Renovation
Project was allotted. $110,000 from
operation funds this year, and
Chaban argues that “in proportion
to the number of people who use
these facilities, the Faculty got 100
times more for its money.”
~“The building,’-’ counters
Dutton, “is not a Faculty Club. We
spent less than half of the trust,
about $105,000, on the room." The
Faculty Club Treasurer added that
The Club “reimburses the Univer-

' sity for the use of this space.”

Administration Scrutinizes
Present Grading Policy

9 BY CATHY TUTTLE

Grading, one of the most
controversial policies in the educa-
tional system, is scrutinized by
some Pitt officials.

What is G grade? What is an I
grade? When are they used. and
how? are questions the Adminis-
tration “ls currently in the midst
of determining,” said Assistant
Provost Ray Steele.

Steele says the definitions given
in the University of Pittsburgh
Bulletin are “the official adminis-
trative position on this matter.”

The Bulletin deﬁnes an I grade as
“a research grade. It indicates that
the work of the course for which it
is awarded has not been complet-
ed. ‘It is awarded only to students
who need more time than the term
allows to complete research on a
project arising from the material of
the course. The I grade can be
given only if the student requests it
and the instructor consents.”

Steele said that “Generally the I
grade is used for incomplete
research, but the G grade was
established and intended to be
used for students with extraordin-
ary problems."

The Bulletin defines the G grade
as “a grade to be given only when a
student who has been attending a

‘course and has been doing the work

is prevented by circumstances
beyond his control from completing
the course after it is "too late to
withdraw.”

Steele says the College Adminis-

“The Student Union,’ said
Dutton, “has not been neglected.
It is the Chancellor’s #1 priority.”
Dutton feels the renovation of the
Union is a much more massive
project, requiring a number of
ﬁnancing phases before its comple-
tion. - .

“Even if the University had
spent the entire trust fund on the
Union,” quipped the Faculty Club

Treasurer, “we still wouldn’t have
a Union.” A
As with completion of the

Conference Center, Dutton said,
“We have recognized the. need and
are seeking ‘the money. The
University has many needs.”

Efficiency stressed B

To Rockefeller Study

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Dr. Marina Whitman, recently
resigned from the President’s
Council of Economic Advisors-, has
been appointed by New York’s
Governor Nelson Rockefeller to
“study the potential third century

‘problems of the United States.

joins Pennsylvania Senator Hugh
Scott, vice-president designate

Gerald Ford, George Schultz,_

Secretary of the Treasury, and 31

Election Code Examined

BY BILL HADUCK

“This year's election procedures
should deﬁnitely be more efﬁcient,
more thorough, and more precise.”

Margie Schramm, Student
Government Election Committee
(SGEC) member, was speaking
about the Student Government_
elections, scheduled January 22
and 23, '1974.

“We’ve been going over the

entire election code, sentence by

sentence,” Schramm said. “We’re .
going to enforce the good regula-
tions and improve on the other
ones.” She noted that several of
the regulations are “too ambiguous
and vague.”

Considering alleged discrepan-
cies during last year's election,
Schramm said several improve-.
ments have been suggested.

“Candidates wo_n’t be able to
walk into classes and campaign,”
she said. Timmy Ging, who was
defeated in his bid for SG Board
last year, agreed. , “No one should
have exclusive_rights to address
classes.” He added, “It's unfair to
set up a captive audience for
yourself.”

Schramm said different color
petition sheets might solve the
problem of board member petitions
being handed in as petitions for
president.

In addition», Schramm said,
“Violations will be looked up. Last
year, they let them slide.”

Another problem, according to
Schramm, is maintaining the
impartiality of the poll watchers‘.
“We can't have pollers encour-
aging people to vote one way of
another. We don't want some-
body’s ace campaigner to man the
polls for us.”

Topics such as poster size, where
campaigning willbe, allowed, and

‘ other campaign regulations will be

discussed ~ at‘ “election procedure‘

meetings December 6 and 7.
“This year we're going to have
the candidates themselves come to
the meetings,” Schramm said. In
past years, a representative of the
candidate was allowed to attend.
“The /point to be stressed,”
Schramm said, “is that we really
want a lot of help. In past years,
we had very few volunteer poll
watchers.” She suggested this
perhaps had a hand in making
some of the past polling practices

“very foggy.” She concluded,
“Students just have to get
interested.”

“YOU’D BETTER NOT TURN THAT DOWN ” says Pitt football

with high schools and civic groups.

Kane said the training offered by
the debate team is extremelywuseful
to legal and investigative careers.
“Particularly,” he added, .“in
research and analysis.”

The seeming obscurity of the
forensic team at Pitt has had no
effect on its national performance
Kane said. “We have to go out of
state to ﬁnd a serious rivalry. An
indication of our quality is that we
consistently win the state finals.”

Kane serves on the faculty of Pitt

BY MONICA A. CIROCCO

Objections to the funding policies
of Student Government (SG) and
the Allocations Committee were
discussed at a special meeting
called byithe Engineering Student
Cabinet (ESC) November 15.

The action was sparked by a
decision by SG, November 14, to
uphold Allocations’ recommenda-
tion not to fund the engineers’
annual Shamrock Ball.

Allocations feels the event -will not
draw sufficient support from the
entire student body to warrant the
expense. It is the Committee's
policy not to fund such functions.
The same rationale was used in the
decisions not to fund the Greek
Week and Military Balls.

Representatives from other or-
ganizations dissatisfied with their
budgets, and members of both SG
and Allocations were invited to
attend the meeting, .

Present were: Dave Groetzinger,
AFROTC military ball co-ordinator;
Gene Heckman, ESC president;
Bob Heister, SG board member;
John Mercuri, ESC physical plant
director; Ed Potosky, Undergrad-
uate Academic Review (UAR)
computer editor; Sue Suehr,

chairperson of the central planning
committee for Engineers’ Week;
Kenneth Swiowa,
representative and Paul Wasilko,
ESC vice-president.

Wasilko stated, “We called this
meeting because we feel SG no

-longer represents the interests of

the students. SG and‘ the
Allocations Committee are alien-
ated from the studentrbody.

“Their funding priorities are not
in line with those of the students
and they have no accountability to a
body other than themselves. They
don't seek out student opinion," he
said.

UAR's Potosky added, “SG
claims the UAR doesn't represent
what the students want and yet a
poll was never taken. All of our
funding was cut. The format they
propose is at least three years off."

‘Referring to accountability. Hei-
ster said the vice—chancellor of
Student Affairs has veto power
over SG.

ESC President Heckman -inter-
jected, “I understand that unless a
formal complaint is registered he
won’t take any action. I have

of Student Affairs Alfred Moye]

his best not to exercise that
power.”

Heister replied, “If you have a
complaint we recommend that you
bring it directly to SG.

“As for the UAR, they didn’t
schedule an interview with the
Allocations Committee and were
spending money they didn't have.”
Heister continued.

“With last year's student refer-
endum taken into consideration,
half of our $300,000 budget was
spent on programming. This was
an increase from 38 per cent last
yearf' «

Mercuri ESC physical plant-

director, stated there is no system
of checks and balances since SG is
not accountable to the students.
“A feedback system is needed,”
he. said. ’

Heister said all SG meetings.are
open and the aim is to treat “A”
like “B,-” which is why the decision
made on the Shamrock Ball was the
same as that made on the Greek
Week and Military Balls.

“Then we are ‘paying for a
mistake made with the Greeks.
Why can’t all‘ three balls be
funded? My feeling is that if we all
get together we--can change the
decisions," Wasilko said.

Suehr and Wasilko emphasized.
that, even if nothing can be
changed this year, they would like
to make sure “things like this”

won’t happen next year.

themselves a part of the Arabic
peoples. -

“I just don’t -understand th
slogan ‘Self-determination for Pal-
estinians,’ ” he said. “A
Palestinian can be a Palestinian
and can have his national dignity
and pride without having Jaffa.”

Joseph Schimron, President of the
Israeli Student Organization at Pitt
said,“The Arabs are like the guy
who kills his parents and then
pleads to the court that he is an
orphan. The Arabs say the
Palestinian problem is the greatest
sore spot in the Middle East but all
they ever talk about is regaining
their territories. *

“The Arabs fought this war to
show the world they can fight,”
Schimron said. “It’s too bad they
think this is the only way to gain
dignity.” A I
YSA’s Nakrin felt Israel had no
right to exist. “Although the Arab
people comprised over two thirds of
the population there, the United
Nations partitioned Palestine in
1947 into two states - one Jewish
and one Arab- in total violation of

‘ the rights and desires of over one

million Palestinians,” he said.

“It’s true that the Palestinians
were the great majority in 1947,”
replied Broido, “but the Jews were
a majority in certain compact areas
in Palestine and the UN" partition
went along these‘ lines.

“I don’t agree with the principle
that if there is a majority within

 
      

 

; .Monday,_N9veinber‘19,,

certain boundaries then the min-

" ority has no right to self-determina-

tion to a great number of people,”
he said. _ _ 6

Nakrin accused Israel of being
“a colonial state, set up, owned,
and maintained by foreign settlers
at the expense "of ‘the native
Palestinians. The US has been
willing to arm the Israelis becauce
Israel is being relied upon to
protect US capital investments
including oil,” he said.

“There is no reason for Israel to
be a backer of capitalism ‘or
imperialism,” Broido countered.
“It doesn’t serve any interest. The
oil lobby in the United States
always fought against Israel from
its very birth. President Truman,
under pressure from this lobby, put
an embargo on arms to Israel in the

I 1948 war.

“Now Israel is backed with US
support only because the Russians
are supporting the Arabs. It’s just
another matter of power politics
and power balance,” he said. i

The Middle East panel dis-
cussion was moderated by Joseph
White, a history instructor at Pitt,
and was part of a YSA educational
weekend at CMU.

-Faculty Club
* Dear Editor,

‘ Recently, a new Faculty Club
was opened in the Old Dental
1 Clinic, now called the Gardner
Steel Conference Center. The
Conference Center is not open yet,
as there is not enough money to
_ I ﬁnish the project. This came about
,‘ through a grant given to the

. University by Mr. Steel. The
amount of the grant was $340,000.
if It has been held by the University

because it was not enough to build

anew building. The University has
. been notiﬁed that they could not
hold the grant any longer, so,
operations came up with the plan to
renovate the old Dental Clinic. The
 Trustees agreed and work started._
The plan called for the Faculty
, Club to be built first. The
estimated construction cost was
$25,000. The total cost, including
construction and furnishings, was
$130,000, that leaves $210,000.
 But this is not enough to ﬁnish the
[7 building. Complete renovation will
‘ p cost $2-3 million. The University
has to go to the GSA for the rest.

This money can not be used for
, something like a Faculty Club.

I am very unhappy about this.
The Faculty gets a spacious new
club, while student facilities of this
type are either nonexistent or
inadequate. The University has

  

 

 

rob, vandalize, litter, and murder--/

7 Page 4§—TiiE PITT lNEWS—Monday, November 19, 1973

given the Student Union $110,000
fortthe year. In proportion of the
number of people who use the
facilities, the Faculty Club got 100
times more for its money.

Not only is the money situation
deplorable, but the University
probably has Mr. Steel turning in
his grave. According to his will,
the money should be used for “...a
chapel, library, assembly hall,
recitation hall, lecture hall, dormi-
tory, or other building of equal
importance,..." I doubt that Mr.
Steel, if he were alive would feel
that a Faculty Club is_of equal
importance with the other build-
ings.

It seems to me that the
University can always find money
for the luxuries for faculty,
administration and/or alumni.
With the way the Union is run
down, one would think that the
University could find money to,
finance renovation of the Union.
But they are giving only $110,000
to this $16 million project while
they can find money for complete
financing of a‘Faculty Club.

To get money for the Union
project the GSA will give $4.6
million (in process of aquiring), $2
million from the alumni, and the
rest from a proposed $15.00 a year
charge upon students, to float a
bond. Why is there this state of
affair at the University? Is it here
to serve students? If so, how can
they justify these actions?

Sincerely,
Larry Chaban

Energy Crisis

Dear Editor:

Recent approval by the U.S.
Senate Interior Committee of the
National Energy Emergency Act of
1973, as well as the passage of
similar acts in Massachusetts and
Maryland, indicate that many
Americans are preparing to sacri-
fice a great deal of democratic
freedom in return for relief from
what has been labeled an “energy
crisis." If this Act is approved by
Congress, it will. extend to
President Nixon virtually dicta-
torial powers to ration oil and
gasoline consumption, to force
industries (includingutilities) to
switch‘ from oil to coal, to shorten
business and school hours, and to
relax controls on pollution
emissions.

Coal industry spokesmen have
expressed doubts as to the ability

.-,3; ' This with

 

of coal companies to increase coal
supplies as rapidly as the proposed
conversion from oil to coal ‘will
require. Moreover, the public can
expect that the costs of higher fuel
taxes and converting the oil to coal
(including repair of damage caused
by increased stripmining) will be
passed on by the corporations in
the form of higher prices on a large
number of consumer goods and
services. In fact, John A. Love.
Director of the White House
Energy Policy Office predicts that
even if the President is given the
power he seeks, Americans will not
be able to resume their normal rate
of power consumption for at least
20 years!

New evidence suggests, how-
ever, that the seriousness of the
“energy crisis’? has been greatly
exaggerated, and that it may be
solved by actions much less severe
than those proposed by the Nixon
Administration. Congressman Les
Aspin (D-Wis.) has uncovered
statistics which show that, at least
since March 31 of this year, the
major oild companies have deliber-
ately held down oil production by
as much as a/ million barrels a day,
presiimably to pressure Congress
into approving constructiongof the
controversial trans-Alaska pipe-
line. He has stated that if the
major U.S. oil producers would
produce at maximum capacity,
there would be little or no need for
the nation to import Arab crude oil.

In addition, it is no secret that
the United States’ unilateral
military support of Israel during
the recent October war, as well as
the proposed U.S.-Israel mutual
security treaty, is the main cause of
the nationalization of the U.S.
owned. Arabian-American Oil
Company by Saudi Arabia and of
the Arab crude oil embargo which,
if it continues into December, will
cause a 17% shortage in U.S.'oil
supplies necessary for the winter
months. ,

Hence, before hastily surrender-
ing power to President Nixon to
deal with an “energy crisis” which
need not exist, citizens who are
sincerely concerned about over-
coming the fuel shortage at home
and preventing war in the Middle
East might first demand - that
Congress immediately:

--launch an investigation into the
production activities of the major
U.S. oil companies during the past
several years; .

--order all U.S. oil companies to
produce at full capacity;

--cease unilateral military sup-

 

port of Israel;

--seek peace in the Middle East
through the United Nations and, if
necessary, through the use of U.N.,
not U.S., military power.

No Apologies

Dear Editor.

Iwas just fired from my position
as reporter and news announcer at
WDUQ-FM. I refused to apologize
for what they felt was an error in

_my judgement when I reported on

President Nixon’s energy crisis
speech.

I reported it as “primary source
material”. The bushers at WDUQ
expected me to be lazy and parrot
the teletype, the safest way for a
newsperson to avoid being a
journalist instead of a plagiariser.
The following two sentencesin my
copy aroused theire of the WDUQ
gang:

“Nixon accused Congress of
footdragging by failing to pass his
energy bills. He said they were
‘preoccupied by other matters.’
That, or course,
gate.”

The WDUQ news director claims
that the last sentence is “editorial-
izing." Bullshit. That isn't an
opinion; the most visible utterances
from Capitol Hill in the past few
weeks have been about Watergate,
the tapes, and impeachment. As a
reporter I had a duty to inform my
audience that Mr. Nixon was using
the energy crisis to scapegoat
Congress for his own ineptitude.

Reporting today (particularly
broadcast) planes shavings instead
of chopping wood. For example, in
reporting Nixon’s speech, the
“objective” school of journalism
mandates “tell us what he said.”
If that is to be interpreted literally,
a reporter doesn’t stop with a
quote, paraphrase or summation.
It means going beyond actual
words, pointing out implications on
points perhaps made deliberately
unclear, giving some background
material on the topic of the speech,
observing contradictions with pre-
vious policy (and often within the
speech itself), questioning the
authenticity of statements which
are at odds with other information,
and most important, telling the
audience what the President’s
words mean for them.

A reporter must sniff for rats, not
hold his nose. The’ epitome of

meant Water- .

journalistic naivete is to become an
unﬁltered conduit for government
proclamation and a reinforcer of
socially-acceptable information.
Unless the reporter can satisfy in
his or her own mind the truth value
of a particular statement, it has no
business on the air.

Broadcast newspeople choose
stories which have a minimum of
disputed information but which
have emotional shock value for the
old ladies (crimes and fires).
Investigative reporting? Instead of
digging the shit up for everyone to
olfactate, they deodorize it.
Anything substantial (nearly
always controversial) becomes an
exercise in trying to'walk on eggs
without breaking them.

Since the White House roared a
few threatening groans, many
news departments went on an
“objectivity” trip. Objectivity is
usually an excuse to justify the
bland, colorless mix which is
commonly called news. Audiences
fall asleep during a_ recitation of
so-called" “facts”, (Which is why

entertainment programming out-’

draws news programming).
Broadcast journalism must ask
itself some fundamental questions.
What is news? How should it be
reported? What is a fact? What is
worth reporting? Journalism
textbooks and professors all have
standard answers, as do news
directors, reporters and the public.
Those standard answers are the
problem. A general human

tendency is to stick to the concrete, .
-the tried-and-true.

If no one had
the guts to /experiment with
electricity, we'd still be reading by
candlelight.

wouldn’t it be far more appropriate
if our pride was based on
exceptional academic quality, out-
standing instructors, and innova-
tive teaching methods, since Pitt’s
primary function is that of an

It would certainly be of more
beneﬁt to the students to allocate
funds now lavished on the football
team on some academically-
oriented program. If, however,
such funds must be spent on
athletics, why not greatly expand
the intramural program and en-
courage students to become active

I realize that my ideas are

Abortion

Dear Editor:

I was one of those who attended
the “debate” on the after-effects of
abortion "between James A.
Buzonas of Students for Human
Life and Roger Johnson of the
School of Public Health held last
Thursday evening (November 8th)
at the Pitt Coffeehouse. The
coffeehouse was called “The Open
Mind”, but a better name might
have been “The Santa Fe
Express.” There have been fewer

_/

T times I’ve seen a better railroad

job.
The “debate” was sponsored,
organized, executed and refereed

. by members of the Student Health

Center and the heavy pro-abortion
bias of those members was
apparent to anyone. who cared to
view the matter objectively. Every
effort was made, and rather

successfully I might add, to

scrupulously exclude from dis-
cussion the only really central
question in the entire abortion
controversy, that is, whether the

fetus can be considered a human .,

being and, so, whether induced
abortion can be considered_murder.

Of course, those committed to
the pro-abortion position have good
reason for. wanting to exclude this
question from public discussion.
The reason is that the ﬁndings of
modern biological science and
genetics overwhelmingly indicate
that a new human being, in the
biological sence of the term, comes
into existence at conception.

To have this knowledge made
public would put them in a rather
touchy position as advocates of
murder, and so the policy they
deem best to pursue is to make
certain public discussion doesnot
come around to this crucial
question. This they accomplished
rather efﬁciently at the “debate”,
even to the point of the
“moderator” shutting up persons
in the audience whose questions so
much as skirted the fringes of that

' judgment--or,

 

issue.

It is true that within the tightly
circumscribed and rigorously con-
trolled area of discussion per-
mitted, Mr. Johnson faired devast-
ingly well against Mr. Buzonas.
But that Buzonas should agree to
debate on a topic about which he
possesses no expertise and which
is, at best, of only peripheral
importance in the overall abortion
controversy, and that he should
agree to debate the topic within a
program and environment almost
exclusively controlled by his
opponents is a reﬂection upon his
rather, upon his
profound lack of judgment.

Furthermore, Mr. Buzonas failed_

to take advantage of the onlygreal
slip-up that his opponents made in
what was otherwise a consum-
mately‘ Machiavellian operation--
the slip-up being their billing the
topic of the “debate” rather
loosely as concerning “The After-
Effects of Abortion (period).”

While letting Mr. Johnson speak
on the after-effects of abortion on
women (a topic which both parties
seemed to assume, unjustiﬁably,
that the debate need be restricted
to), Buzonas could conceivably
have turned the situation around to
his advantage by talking about the
after-effects of induced abortion on
the unborn child (near to 100%
mortality, among other things)‘
and, so, could have justified his
showing a ‘particularly damning

Congressman William S. Moor-
head, Pittsburgh Democrat, said
President Nixon would be doing his
highest patriotic duty to resign as
soon as vice-president designate
Gefald _Ford is conﬁrmed by
Congress.

, “ es, I do not share the belief

tion of Gerry Ford the President

the already instituted inquiry into
whether or not the President
should be impeached,” Moorhead
"added.

 ‘Moorhead and 61 other con-
gressmen, including Bella Abzug
and Gerald ‘Ford, entered a
resolution during the first House
session after the ﬁring of special
Watergate prosecutor Archibald
Cox, directing the House Judiciary
Committee to “investigate whether
grounds exist for the impeachment
of Richard M. Nixon.”

' -The Judiciary Committee may
ﬁnd that contributions from the
Milk Producers Association and
‘International Telephone and Tele-
graph" (ITT) contributions consti-
trite “bribery" under the constitu-
tion‘, Moorhead explained.

“If the inquiry produces what I

think it will produce--evidence of
violation of the Constitution--then I
would vote yes to impeach. If the
‘vote came up tomorrow, I’d vote
no,” Moorhead said.

gressman since 1958, said he
favors a Presidential resignation
before an impeachment.

possible resignation or impeach-
ment of President Nixon.

Last week four experts from the

to the situation as the impeachment
of Andrew Johnson,” he ex-
plained. “I think that would be
most unfortunate. The House
should not impeach unless there is
a reasonable good chance for
conviction.” A

”It was one of the

history of the republic.”

Moorhead said impeachment
resolutions probably haven’t been
popular in the House because “of
the general dread of impeachment
proceedings caused by the prece-.
dent .of Andrew Johnson’s im-
peachment.” Some historians say
Johnson’s presidency was ruined’

President Nixon should not resign,

and suggested’ there may be

grounds for impeachment other
than through court of law type
evidence. _

“I suppose Gerry Fordwas right
several years ago when he said an
impeachable offense was what a
majority of the House and
two-thirds of the Senate say it is,”
Seeburger said. -

“So I suspect that if where there
is smoke there is fire Nixon has
committed impeachable offenses
and the Congress would be
justified in ’ impeaching‘ him.”

I feel he has committed crimes and

misdemeanors while in office. So
because of this, as a practical
matter, he should do his highest
patriotic duty and resign.” -
“The straw that broke the
camel’s back,” Moorhead said,
“was the day Archibald Cox was
ﬁred.‘ It was one of the darkest
days in the history of the republic.”

The President’s explanation, he
added, is that the nature of the
world and our government have
changed in terms‘ of foreign policy
decisions, etc. and correspondingly
the authority of the President has
changed so he seemingly has more
power than before.

“Therefore, the kinds of things
he doesare independent of the
checks we’ve had in the past. So
maybe what we need is a new kind
of check on the president since we
have a new kind of presidency.”

“Maybe now,” Seeburger con-
tinued, “that is whatwe can use
impeachment for, but not on
partisan political issues, rather on
institutional issues, to say we don’t
want the presidency going in this
direction.”

Seeburger explained he had
been thinking of this theory ever
since the ﬁring of his old Harvard
law professor, Archibald’Cox, as
special prosecutor. Seeburger said
prior to the Cox ﬁring he felt talk of
impeachment was unrealistic, but
afterwards, “as a practical matter,

' we’ve got to push ahead.

“I offer this argument in behalf
of _ pursuing impeachment on
grounds otherithan those tradition-
ally advanced,” Seeburger said.
“For better or worse the Constitu-
tion has evolved into a different

‘ kind of Presidency so maybe we

need a different type of check on
it.” ~

On the other extreme, Seeburger.

said if the President were
convinced he was unable to govern,
he ought to consider resigning. He
did not feel Nixon is unable to
govern. '

“Right now things are working
better with a president of one party
and a Congress of another party
than when Truman was president,
and Truman
It turned out he was
right, so heaven help us--maybe
Nixon’s right.

“So I think this is an argument
against resigning, just because he
can’t get his programs through
Congress,” Seeburger added.

Dr. Tracy Strong of the political
science department feels if Presi-
dent Nixon is ousted from office, it
should be done constitutionally
through impeachment.

“The feeling of _ most people,
including congressmen, is that the
size, of the government has gotten

— so large, that it is out of the hand,

out of gut, and out of control in
terms of economy, social problems,
and_in terms of foreign policy.

“There’s a general feeling that
we can’t do anything signiﬁcant
that will inﬂuence the course of
events.

“And then a thing like Water-
gate comes along,” Strong con-
tinued, “which presents itself
essentially as a moral issue and an
issue of very great signiﬁcance to
the American polity.” '

Strong noted Watergate is one of
the few remaining issues in the
United States where it is possible
for people to feel they should make
a difference, and where it is also
possible for them to in‘ fact make a
difference; , '
“Personally I feel this (impeach-
ment) is something that should not
be denied to the Congress and the
people's sense of themselves
politically, simply for the good of
the country,” he said.

Strong, a Harvard graduate,
whose doctoral thesis was titled
Friedrich Nietzsche: The trans-
ﬁguration of politics, had great
reservations that Congress would
pressure Nixon to resign on the
grounds he was unﬁt to rule.

“I think the whole question that
he can't govern is a -bit
problematic. First, if you look at

 

pressure on the House so they
don’t forget about it.”
Seeburger, an ex-classmate of
former Deputy Attorney General
William Ruckelshaus, said the only
constitutional way to get much of
the evidence needed for conviction,

such as presidential tapes, is
through’ the impeachment process.

he can govern, has governed, and
is governing.”

Richard Nixon will be able to
govern badly, Strong asserted, but
then Richard Nixon isn’t going to

resign because you tell him he’s

governing badly.

“I would like to see the man out
of office,” said Strong, who does
not favor Nixon resigning. “I think

he’s a danger to the country, for '

political reasons, and one can only
speculate, but for psychological
reasons also.”

The problem then, Strong says,
is whether or not the President can

- be impeached. He does not feel, if

the impeachment rests on the tapes
issue, that Nixon will be im-
peached. .

“At this point, it doesn’t seem
that the tapes are going to prove
any more than a red herring.

“Then impeachment,” Strong
continued, ‘‘will require the special
prosecutor pushing fairly hard for
documents he may or may not know
the existence of and that may or
"may not become available.”

Strong said impeachment can
result from two things, a strong
demand from the country,’ and
evidence that would prove the
President’s guilt.

‘‘It seems that the demand has
hit its peak at this point,” Strong
explained. “I mean there’s hardly
more he can do. And right now,

“Then it isinot too strong to

Tracy Strong: “Impeachment is something that should not be denied
to the Congress and the people’s sense of themselves politically.”

Mike Cardillo, a construction
worker from Fayette Township,
does not think there is any reason
for Nixon to resign, but feels the
House of Representatives should
impeach to determine the Presi-
dent's guilt or innocence.

“If the man is guilty they should I

convict him, but I don’t think there
is enough evidence against him
right now to" justify resigning,”
Cardillo said. “There’s' really not
even enough evidence to impeach
him.

i “I don’t think he ought to «resign.
They should impeach him to clear
the whole thing up because when it
goes on like this nothing is ever
settled.”

Cardillo said there will probably
be enough evidence to convict
President Nixon, but it hasn’t been
brought out in the investigations at
this point.

Talking at the Forbes Field

construction site, Cardillo noted,-

“Resigning proves nothing but

he’s guilty without a trial. I think I

he’s innocent until proven guilty.
This whole thing, where you have
allthose people squealing on one
another might _be a conspiracy to
wreck the country.

“I don’t think he (Nixon) himself
feels he has done anything wrong
that would justify impeachment.

But Agnew, they had the evidence
on him, there was no way out. He
had no contest so he had to
resign.”

_But whatever is done, Cardil-lo
stressed, must be .done with great

speed to get the situation cleared

“I have mixed emotions about
whether or not the President is
guilty, but I’ve been a Republican
for 20 years and I’m fed up with the
Republican ’ party after this
trouble.” A

 

Dr. Marina Whitman, a Pitt
economics professor who resigned
August 15 from President Nixon’s
Council of Economic Advisers, felt
it was difﬁcult to measure the

economic differences between an‘

impeachment and a resignation.

As the economic situation is not a
large issue in the matter pressuring
the President to leave office,
Whitman declined to relate her
personal opinions on the subject.
However, she did elaborate on the
potential economic problems with
impeachment and resignation.

“I suppose that if the President
were impeached, it would result in
changes caused by the pressures of
the situation. He may have to do
something_ under the situation that
he may not do normally,” Whitman
said.

“For instance, with impeach‘-
ment proceedings going on, he
might be under more pressure to
yield to public inﬂuence on a
certain issue where normally he
would hold out for a more
reasonable alternative.”

Whitman, who was the first
woman appointed to the Presi-
dent’s Council, said the President
might have to make economic
decisions more rapidly under the
pressures of impeachment, which
could. cause differences in policy
making.

“Of course,” Whitman con-
tinued, “if the President resigned
and Gerald Ford came in, there
wouldhave to be some ‘changes
because eventually he would have
different people working ‘on the

problems and so forth. Naturally’

there has to be a change when
there isn’t the exact situation as
before. ~

named Mary. a frequent visitor to
the emergency room due to her
history of heart aliments and a
hearing problem.

“HOW ARE YOU MARY?”

“Not too good,” a croaking
hoarse voice says.

“ARE YOU IN PAIN NOW?”

A croaking reply.

“WHEN DID THE PAIN
START?’.’

Mary seems to know the routine
and her voice -crackles with
description of the pain, where it
originates and its severity.

Nothing more is heard from Mary,
a few minutes later the intern
emerges, walks into, the nurses
station and tells the head nurse,
“Possible cardiac arrest, keep her
on the monitor and observation.
I’ve tried to relieve the pain.”

The psychiatric social worker, a
small, dark haired girl of 26 offers
me a cup of coffee.

A young woman with dirty hair,
lying on a movable bed, with
bandaged hands and legs, moans
for her purse before she is taken
away by a man in a plaid coat and
red tie. '

“I just called a psychiatrist from
Western Psychiatric [Institute and
Clinic] to consult with her,” the
social worker says, motioning to
the bed being taken down" the hall.
“She’s a suicide attempt--lives
with her boyfriend, an alcoholic
who steals her money. Last night
she tried to slash her wrists, "ankles

A and neck with a razor, but it didn’t

work. She walked innthis morning

after the bleeding stopped and
hardened.”

The social worker has time to talk
to me now, and beckons me to her
office, across the aisle from the
nurses’ station, next to the waiting
room. The patients in the waiting
room look at me brieﬂy, as if to ask,
“Are you someone important, or
can’t they find out what’s wrong
with you?” and return to their
reading.

“A lot of those people in the
waiting room are going to be
waiting a while,” the social
worker said. “The most serious
cases are taken care of first, with
the most serious cases brought in
through the back doors--gunshot
wounds, heart attacks, car acci-
dents. Most of the people out there
should go to a family doctor, except
that there are few family physicians
in the surrounding Oakland area
and the Hill District.

“The real proplem is that these
patients should go to Falk Clinic,
an out-patient clinic under the
direction of Presby, where they
would be taken care of by the same
staff, but with less cost. They
wouldn’t have to wait so long. But
some people feel that going to a
clinic has a stigma attached to it;
that they’re poor and can’t afford
specialists. What they don’t
realize is when they walk into the
emergency room door with a sore
throat or whatever, a $25 fee is
immediately slapped on their
bill--just for the use of ' the
facilities.”

She describes her job to me--she
tries to help the nurses and doctors
in any way possible when she has
time. When a psychiatric patient

enters the emergency room, she

trys to calm him down and ‘find out
the cause of the problem and some
emotional history. If treatment
must be given, she will stand by.
But ifthe patient is hallucinating,
or in a frenzy, she places him in the
quiet room--a large square, dimly
lit room, with plastered walls that
are replastered nearly every
month, mainly due to the users’
violence. The room has a cot, with
leather straps for tying the patient
down, which is used only when
necessary. _

“In my job it’s possible to know
what’s going on in the neighbor-

hood,” she says, after declining a 1

cigarette. “A couple of weeks ago,
a bad shipment of drugs must have
come in--we had four cases of bad
trips in a night, they were all at the
same party, and three of the four
cases were pretty serious. They
were in the intensive care unit for a
week.” ~

But herjob has drawbacks. “Last
week, a girl rode in the ambulance
with her mother, who was a cardiac
patient. The emergency room staff
took care of her mother, while I
tried to prepare the girl for what
eventually did happen. Anyway,
her mother died, and the doctor
came in here to tell the girl, but she
didn’t comprehend for a few
minutes. There's nothing a human
can do in cases like that, except
offer my shoulder to cry on, give
her some tissues and make some
phone calls for her. But I don’t look
forward to having to tell a member

of the family myself--I’d rather let

a doctor do it.” V
The social worker was called back
to consult with the psychiatrist, so I

Playboy's most famous cartoon-
ist Gahan Wilson, will highlight a
two-day cartoon symposium" next
week, called Cartoon Mania.

Wilson, a Playboy employee for 10
years, has had his cartoons
described as bizarre, grotesque
and cynical. He disagrees.

“I look upon my work as
optimistic and affectionate. I am
kindly disposed to humankind. My
monsters are symbols of people
faltering. Monsters remind us of
ourselves,” he said.

Although his ﬁrst consideration is
to be funny, the cartoonist admits
he increasingly comments about
current issues. The reason for this
he explained, is that the absurdi-
ties read in the newspapers have
made the horrors of the imagina-
tion small pickings.

“Where is Frankenstein now that
Christian_Barnard’s here?”he ask-
ed. '

Some of his cartoons on ecology

have been used in anti-pollution '

Wilson, who always wanted to be pi e ; 

a cartoonist, graduated from the ‘

Art Institute of Chicago. ‘‘I tried ._ « 

some schools for cartooning, but
found them to be too superﬁcial,”
he said.

Besides working for Playboy‘,-

Wilson has plllbilished three collec-iii

tions of cartoons,Graveside Man-I ,

 

ner, The Man in the Cannibal Pot,  
and I Paint What I See. He has also, ' C V77

books including one he wrote called.

Wilson's lecture topic November

“I did a spread for Playboy on I

While here, Wilson will also judge

.- SW,-

 1973" I  

The stories in A Russian Beauty

’do not represent Nabokov"s most
' significant work, but they are well

worth reading. The collection’s
shortcomings are far outweighed
by the style: brilliant, precise
prose that distinguishes Nabokov’s
work. Most of the stories concern
emigres living in Paris or Berlin.
Sharing similar thematic concerns,
they deal with people alienated
from their past world.

The title story is, as Nabokov
writes “an amusing miniature,
with an unexpected solution.”
“The Leonardo” also closes with a
surprise and is distinguished by
Nabokov’s genius for writing
marvelous prose and story con-
struction;

The most imaginative story in
the collection is the aformentioned
‘-‘Terra Incognita” a brilliant
nightmare-like piece.

“The Circle” which concerns
events in Nabokov’s novel The Gift

 

-is one of the best stories. “The

Circle”, like Joyce’s Finnegan’s
Wake, is circularin structure, “its
last sentence existing implicitly
before its first one.” The story
concerns a school teacher’s son
who meets a.woman in Paris that
he had been in love with in Russia
many years earlier. Nabokov
vividly describes the events and
atmosphere of their way of living
when they were in pre-Revolu-
tionary Russia.

“An Affair of Honor”, the story
of a cowardly cuckold and “Lips to
Lips” which describes an old
businessman who decides to
become a novelist both show
Nabokov as a stern but not unjust
judge" of human character. In
“Lips to Lips”, Nabokov excels in
describing the aspiring novelist,
his writing, and the peoplewho
take advantage of him.

“Eugenia Isakovna Mints was an
elderly emigree widow, who always

THE KNIGI-IT.D|D SEE THE WISDOM wHIcI-I PREPARATIONS wege \

wore black. Her only son had died
the previous day. She had not been
told." In three concise sentences,
Nabokov established the basic
premise of “Breaking the News”.

The rest of this story, which is one
of the finest in the book, concerns
the efforts of the widow’s friends to
break the news. This task (very
difficult task since the old woman is
deaf and frequently turns off her
hearing aid) is finally accom-
.plished.. The passage in which her

realization of the truth is shown is I

brilliantly subtle.
su-bﬁl-as ‘

The appearance of trivial but
entertaining pieces like “Torpid
Smoke” is more than outbalanced
by two chapters from an incomplete
novel written in 1940. “Ultima
Thule” and “Solus Rex” which are
the book’s most important contri-
butions to Nabokov’s total. work,
concern an artist whose wife has
just died. In his grief he becomes

kov: “A Russian Beauty"

totally absorbed in an imaginary
country that he has evolved in his
work. More than the other stories,
“Ultima Thule” and “Solus Rex”
are distinguished by ﬁne charac-
terization.

These early stories, while not
representative of Nabokov’s most
mature work arenskiilfully con-
structed. Limited only by an
occasionally weak choice of subject,
these tales combine vivid imagina-
tion, a brilliant prose style,
intelligence and sophistication;
points which make A Russian
Beauty well worth the attention of
any reader interested in work by
one of the world’s best living
authors. I

Although it may seem_ like it,
rock and roll hasn't been around
forever. Before rock, there was
another brand of illicit music that
brought to mind -drugs, sex and
some highly sensual ‘beats.

The word was Jazz: hot,
burning, highly volatile Jazz.
Although legitimized to an extent
(unfortunately), jazz is still with us,
as potent as ever. And one of the
granddaddies of the backbeat, Gil
Evans, has come up with a new
album Svengali (Atlantic), as
spellbinding as its namesake. .

Gil relies much on that_big,
brassy sound that is almost
synonymous with jazz. The disc's
opener, ..“Thoroughbred,” has a
solid wall of heavy brass that seems
to herald the call to the Final
Judgement. A‘ shorter cut,
“Eleven,” uses the fine trumpet of
Richard Williams to get
moving.

Of course. brass alone does not
make jazz, and Gil’s group has
much more to offer. “Blues in
Orbit" is a free-form movement
in the finest ofjazz tradition. It’s a
spiraling, gripping, but never static

piece. “Cryof Hunger" is another
slow, almost _weeping number. the
kind that puts real jazz buffs into
an ecstasy of pain. A writhing
rendition of the classic “Summer-
time" putsnew meaning into that
-hot, humid season. Closing the
album is a Gil Evans original, “Zee
Zee," an almost ethereal piece that
beckons for more.

And now something for the
“new” jazz fans, who have been

heavier beat with a bit more

album is marked by some fantastic
solo numbers, not to mention the

the record with the ' almost

Bowl-bound Cats are now 6-3-1.

The cadets could not penetrate

Pitt spent most of the game inside

Tony Dorsett rushed for 178

whole game, and quarterback Billy

touchdown pass to Rodney Clark.

something that didn’t keep him

Army again could not sustain a.

Moving from the Pitt 38, Daniels_

IlllllllllllIIllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll .

‘ Q West Point, N.Y.---Three years ago, when Pitt’s current crop of
seniors were freshmen, the junior varsity was enroute to an upset of
Penn State's frosh. Leading by seven with less than 30 seconds to go,
Pitt tried a field goal from the PSU 15. The kick was blocked, returned
for a touchdown, and the two-point conversion gave Penn ‘State the

game.

That game was only a sign of things to come. In their sophomore and
junior years, they would only taste victory four times. The outlook for
their senior year seemed just as bleak, but then along came Johnny

Majors. / .

“We’re going to turn this program around,” said Majors. “But you
can’t do it in one game, maybe not in one season. We are going to

build a winning program at Pitt.”

Majors has admitted many times that he didn’t realize how much

returning talent there was.

The fact that the entire offensive line,

which ranks with the best in the country, is comprised entirely of

returnees is indicative of this.

But what went through the minds of the Pitt seniors, as they heard
that things weren’t going to change overnight? What did they think as

their ﬁnal season began?

‘ ‘I knew we had talent here,’ ’ said defensive tackle Gle‘n Hyde. “We
just needed somebody to direct it.” Hyde added that he felt there was
a possibility that Pitt would wind up in a bowl game.

Most other Pitt seniors could not say that a bowl game was at the top

of their heads.

“I just hoped we'd have a winning season,” said defensive end Jim

Buckmon .

“I was just hoping to win half our games.”

, “I felt there was a good chance of making a good showing after the
pre-season workouts,” said linebacker Rod Kirby. “A bowl game has
been my dream since I came to “Pitt.” _

“The team has come‘ a long way since spring drills began,” said

guard Ray Olsen.

“I didn’t want to go out a loser.”

Majors credited the seniors with carrying the load this year. “Our
seniors have done an outstanding job,” he said. “We wouldn’t have

been anywhere with them.”

As he accepted the Fiesta Bowl invitation, Majors summed things up

well.

“I accept this on behalf of a ﬁne football team and the

tremendous leadership of our seniors." ,
There is one game left in Pitt’s regular season, and Majors certainly

isn't forgetting about that.

“We have a bowl game next week in

University Park against Penn State to determine the championship of

the East,” he told the squad.

The Penn State game could not be erased from his mind. Talking to
the news media, even at the signing ceremony, the game with the
Nittany Lions did not go unmentioned.

“The Penn State game is the biggest game of the season for most of

us seniors,” said Offensive tackle Dave Wannstedt.

“We remember

that freshmen game, and you could say that this is going to be a grudge

~ match.” -

The stage is set for Saturday’s game. It seems certain that Penn
State won’t have its third team in by the third quarter, as has been the

case in the past.

Pitt has a good chance of upsetting Penn State. Undefeated on the
road, this team thinks it can play with anybody, and that has yet to be
disproved this season. Notre Dame and Tulane were outplayed by Pitt,
but won due to turnovers. If Pitt can control the number of turnovers,

it will win Saturday.

Pitt could not get inside the Army I

10, so Carson Long, came along to
kick his ﬁfth ﬁeld goal of the
season, a 31-yarder, and Pitt led
10-0 as the first quarter ended.

Army could only muster two first,

downs in the second stanza, while
Pitt moved the ball well, but saw
turnovers and fumbles cost it
points.

The only score of the period came
when Daniels faked a handoff, then
ﬁred a pass down the left sideline"
to Clark who was wide open. He
hauled it in at about the ten, and
went into the endzone untouched.
Long’s conversion made it 17-0
which is how the half ended.

Pitt took the second half opening
kickoff from its 21 to the Army 11,

. but two incomplete passes forced

Long to come on, and his sixth
three-pointer of the year gave Pitt a
20-0 lead, and tied Fred Cox’s Pitt
record, set in 1961.

A 25-yard passpto wingback Bruce
Murphy and a 21-yarder to Clark
set the stage for,Dorsett’s one-yard
vault over the middle of the Pitt
line, which put Pittiahead,27-0.

Army quaterback Kingsley Fink,
whose passes were either over-
thrown or dropped, was replaced
by Greg McGlasker in the fourth

quarter, and McGlasker sustained‘

the longest Army drive of the
game, 45 yards, but it ended when
his fourth-down pass was inter-
cepted by Spates at the Pitt 16.

BY VINCE DI NARDO

Your name is Clair Wilson.

You've been a halfback at the
University of Pittsburgh for the last
four years and all you have to show
for it are scarred knees and lots,
and lots, of losses--26 to be exact.

You’ve been laughed at, criti-
cized, and cussed. You’ve payed it

much music. You are disappointed
about your collegiate football
career.

Then this flashy character
arrives from Tennessee and asks
you to be proud. He wants you to
He demands you
be a winner. You try it and you like
it.

So much in fact, that with two

weeks to go in your last football
season, you have a chance to succor
your wounds, once and for all, and

spit in the face of the same:

adversity that has relentlessly
haunted you.

If your name is Clair Wilson, a
dream came true after Saturday’s
Army game, and baby, chills are
running up and down your spinal
cord. And by the time you get to
Pheonix you'll be laughing".

“I’ve always dreamed of going to
a Bowl game," Wilson said Sunday
night, about his team being offered
and accepting a bid to play in the
Fiesta Bowl Friday, December
21st, in Pheonix, Arizona. “It’s a
dream come true. It's like a little
kid with a dream. When I get off

that plane in Pheonix, I'll be
happy. But ﬁrst,” he suddenly
added, “Penn State is first." I
Clair has gone through too much
to overlook the Penn State game.
Johnny Majors has taught him
well. He’s acting like a kid who
knows he's getting a bicycle for
Christmas, but who has a birthday
on Christmas Eve and is apprehen-
sive of what it might bring.
“The Fiesta Bowl is one thing,"
he noted, “but right now Penn
State is the big thing." A
Should the Panthers defeat Penn
State and go on to win the Fiesta
Bowl, high national ranking would
be emminent--like would you
believe the top ten!!! The thought
of it thrills Wilson; his ﬁsts

Skaters Fined For PSU Brawl .

In a letter addressed to the Pitt
Hockey received late Friday,
Western Pa. Intercollegiate Hockey

‘Association commissioner Bob
McCurdy has assessed a $10 ﬁne«

on each of the Pitt skaters that left
the bench toparticipate in a brawl

contest.
McCurdy stressed that the
league could not afford such

actions to take place in the future‘

an cited the powers vested in him

by league rules in handing down.

the ﬁnes. The WPIHA currently
plays under National Hockey
League rules. -

“I have respect for the com-

imissioner and the position he is

in,” Pitt Hockey Club president
Bart Mack stated, “but by ﬁning us
he is not attacking the root of the
problem.”

Also fined $10 a man was the
Penn State McKeesport team, for
each that left the bench to fight.

sent one PSU skater to the hospital
with a reported fractured skull.
Shaeffer’s playing status has not
been changed and no further action
will be taken unless he is involved
in another “assault,” as the letter
phrased it.

The ﬁnes must be paid by
December 1, 1973, or each‘ player
will be subject to suspension for
part or the remainder of the
season. If the Pitt Hockey Club
decides to pick up the tab, it will
run somewhere around $150, since
there were only ﬁve men on the ice
at the time of the altercation and
the entire bench poured on the ice
for one reason or another.

“Of course we’re going to appeal
the ruling,” Mack/continued. “I’m

not saying that we were right in
emptying ou_r bench but there are
circumstances surrounding the
incident that have to be taken into
further consideration."

The appeal must be made in
writing to the commissionerwithin
five days, effective last Friday. A
formal appeal will also be made by
the Club at an executive board

.meeting set for November 29.

“This ruling and subsequent
appeal is going to have to stand as
a precedent for the rest of the
season,” Mack remarked. “It’s
obvious something is going to have
to be done about the league rules.
Amatuers cannot continue to play
under a set of rules designed for a
professional league.”

Sparked by a ﬁve goal perfor-
mance by freshman winger Rick

 I 1 Vernon, the Pitt Hockey Club rolled

to an 8-3 win over St. Vincents
College last night at the Kirk Nevin
Arena in Greensburg, Pa. The win
is the skater’s second in Western
.- Pa. Intercollegiate Hockey Associa-
tion play and third overall.
Vernon scored in each period of
the contest but three of his
redlighters came in the last ﬁve
minutes of the game. After beating
Vinnie goalie Herbet Glinka with

1, 5:50 left to play to make the score

Pitt  St. Vincent 3, Vernon picked
up his last two goals within a span
_‘ of eight seconds.
' ,Both came on faceoffs in the St.
Vincent end. With 3:36 left to play,
Joe Testa won the draw on the
faceoff and ﬁred. the puck to
Vernon, who was positioned in the
slot. Vernon let go a blazing wrist
shot that caught the upper right

' hand corner of the net. The second

tally came only eight seconds later
after the Vinnies had been called
for_..icing.- I ‘

" Center Charly Hagins won the
faceoff this time and an exact
duplicate of the preceeding play
occured. With the puck still sliding
into the slot, Vernon unleashed
another blazing wrist shot that the
Vinnie’s goalie never saw.

It was a differenct contest after
the ﬁrst period, however. Gary
Cummings ' opened the scoring
after four minutes with a gift from
Glicka. On a shot by Pitt’s Greg
Mintz, Glicka attempted to catch
the puck but failed, letting the
rubber fall to his left. Cummings
was right thereto slam it home for
his fourth goal of the season.

The Vinnies came right back_and
grabbed the lead with a pair of
goals. Pitt goaltender Mark
Lieberman was down and out after
making a pair of saves when Len
Hoenﬁeld scored his first goal of
the contest. The play developed
when the skaters had extreme
difficulty clearing the puck out of
their own end.

Pierre Plante tallied the next
goal for the Vinnies and for a
minute and 20 seconds they held a
2-1 lead. Greg Mintz tied the game
on a beautiful passing play from his
Iinemates, Testa and Cummings.

With 4:16 left in the opening
frame, Vernon put Pitt in the lead
to stay with another assist from
Hagins. « ‘ I

The second period opened just_ as
the first had closed, with Vernon
scoring from Hagins 2:10 into play.

of an onslaught of penalties call on
both sides.

Freshman defenseman Bob
Arturo let loose with a booming
slapshot from the right point that
Glicka seemingly had a line on.
But Hagins deﬂected the shot and
the puck sailed into the upper left
corner past a surprised Glicka.

The final :15 minutes of play
included nine penalty calls by
referee Al Lefcourt. During most
of the period, either one side or the
‘other played shorthanded. At one
point the two teams were playing
three men a side. The officiating
came under constand criticism
from the Pitt bench and at one
point Vernon had to be refrained
from further argument with the
officials.

The incident came after Pitt wing

Denny Browne walked in all alone
on Glicka, with a single St. Vincent
skater trailing the play. Seeing
that Browne would not be caught,
he three his stick in an attempt to
break up the play but failed. As
Browne slowed to take his shot, the
St. Vincent skater charged him
from behind, taking him down to
the ice.

A penalty shot should have been
in order but the referee ruled that
the stick “had slipped from the
hands” of the Vinnie’s defender.
No penalty was assessed either for
the way he took Browne to the ice.

goal past Lieberman after’ the Pitt
goalie nearly had his head taken off
only moments before. Rick Vance
wound up with a vicious slapshot
from the top of the right faceoff
circle that Lieberman barely
ducked. Seconds later, John
Holowid fired a wristshot from an
equally close distance that sailed
over Lieberman’s masked face and
off the glass.

The rebound came to the right

and followed with seconds in most
events. ’

Commenting on the meet, Coach
Virginia Grindle said, “We went to
Youngstown to win, and we did.
We're happy to add this young
team to our schedule. Their team
reminds me of Pitt’s team years
ago, in it formative years.”

The Pitt women had some hotly
contested events in the meet.

freestyle with times of 1:O0.0 and

1200.6, respectively. Heretick
holds thepteam record in this event,
with a 59.8.

Freshman Vicki Coleman and
Glynnis Lyons sprinted to times of
27.99 and 28.01 for another close
one-two finish. Lyons set this team
record two years ago.

In the 50-yard butterﬂy, Sue
Price continued her winning streak
with a time of 29.8. Senior Kitty
Martin followed closely. to capture
another second place for Pitt. C

Other Pitt firsts included both
relays. The medley relay,
composed of Annamarie Crelli.
Heretick, Price, and Lyons placed
first with a time of 2:09.4. A
freestyle relay, approaching the
team record, clocked a 1252.1.
Members of that relay were:
Coleman, Price, Lyons, and Here-
tick.

Lopez and Crelli retained their
one-two tradition in the 50 yard
breast stroke with times of 33.7 and
36.9. In the 100 breast stroke,
Crelli took first with a 1:22.2 and
Martin took second with 'a 1:26.~3

Senior swimmer Anne.Wallisch
grabbed a first place in the
200-yard freestyle with a 2:31.2,
and Michelle Knoll took second
with a 2:34.5. Coleman swam to a
first place in the 100 yd. IM in

1:1().5, followed by Eloise Kester,
who took third with a 1:220, and
narrowly missed a second place.

Nursing student, Linda Bender
took two first places in the 50 and
100 yard backstroke events closely
followed by freshman Mickey
Chamberlain. .

The Pitt divers fared well in this
meet. Bert Snoznik placed a
well-deserved first with 157.0
points. Sandra Lipp placed third
with 136.3, points and Sharon
Schoelkopf dove exhibition; both
putting in fine performances.
Diving assistant, AAU diving
champion Barb Schaefer com-

mented on her divers’ perform- '

ances. .

“They came to the meet relaxed
and ready to. dive. They did just
great. I think their record speaks
for itself."

Reflecting on the meet, assistant
swimming coach Kate Mathison
said, “The win was
necessary for the team's morale:

We've been breaking records and
really improving our times. but we
needed a win for our record. This
meet shows the depth of-our team.
as we had our second and third
swimmers in taking points.

“We’re looking forward to a
good, close meet with Kent State
next month, after our win against
them last year.”

The Piranhas take on Kent State
on December 08th. at Kent. Last
year was the first time Pitt women
swimmers ever defeated Kent
State, and the team hopes to repeat
that this year.

records were set in that meet, and
three of them were by freshmen.

“I happen to think that recruiting
is an integral part of any team,”
= says Dick Bradshaw, “the only
zreason no one has taken great
.. notice of our recruiting is becuase it
iytakes a while to build a winning
in swim team. You need more than
just one superstar. You need a
Tony Dorsett in each event.”

The swimmers had their ﬁrst
{winning season in ten years last
.. _year under Coaches Bradshaw and
-‘Coffey. There are 15 returning
. sophomores-from last year’s squad
1 and Bradshaw's recruiting has
‘picked up seventeen more fresh-
g men. .

One of those freshmen, Carlos
..Santiago has just returned from
. competing in the World Games in
‘Yugoslavia and in last Saturday’s
-Jpractice meet. “Tato," as he is

nicknamed by his teammates, set a

new Pitt, team record for the

200-yard freestyle event.

‘ Walt Young, another freshmen,
. defeated the existing team record
"in the 1000 yard race by 12
seconds. Not only that, but the
Panthers supposedly have a dis-
P - tance swimmer who is better than

‘ Young by the name of Jerry
. Demuro, who set a team record in
the 500 free-style event.

' There is one other freshman on
the team who gets nothing but high
praise from diving coach Al Coffey.

‘‘I think that Tom Faytol is one of
the best freshman divers in this
country." said Coffey, “he was
able to learn four new dives in
three weeks, all exceeding a degree
of difficulty of 2.5.” And for those
who are not familiar with diving
anyone with a 2.5 degree of
difficulty is a tough dive and four of
them makes it even harder.

Faytol and Jeff Miller did not
participate in the practice meet as
they were on their way to the
Clarion diving meet which includes
teams like Indiana, Ohio State, and
USC. Coach Coffey says that if his
divers can make it to the finals
against the best teams in the
country he will be more than
happy- -

Asked about his chances for a
better season than last year,‘Coach
Bradshaw responded that he would
have to steal a line from Johnny
Majors. ‘

“We’ll just have to take ’em one
at a time.”

Booters Showed Under.

BY G. W. STEVENS

The Pitt soccer team traveled to
Penn State last Friday nightonly to
see their hopes of ‘upsetting the
powerful Nittany Lions go out in a
blinding snowstorm. The weather
wiped out any chance the Panthers
had as the talented Penn State
squad took advantage of the
snow-covered field to run away
from the Panthers by a 6-2 score.

The entire game was playedin a
heavy snowfall that was nothing
short.of a blizzard. Unfortunately
for the Pitt squad, the playing
surface was suited for the Lions.
They were able to take control of
the game from the opening kick
and simply ran circles around the
‘struggling Panthers. Their greater
speed and ball handling abilities
enabled them to move "the ball
upﬁeld, putting pressure on the
Pitt defense throughout the game.

The Pitt booters tried as best
they could under the ‘ circum-

stances,«but they soon found that
they were up against more than a
snowstorm. The Penn State team
used their ability to move the ball,
passing and weaving their way up
the field. If a player would slip on
the icy surface, one of his
teammates would be there to help.
out. By controlling the ball, the
Lions were able to put shot after
shot on.the Pitt nets.

All of the scoring came in the
first half with the exception of one
Penn State goal. The Lions scored
first and never gave up the lead.
John Brossa led the way for the
Penn State squad by scoring three
goals in the first half. J oe Thomas,
Dennis Appleby, and Bill Jones
added the other three with Jones’
goal coming in the second half.

The ﬁrst Pitt goal was scored by
senior centerman Joe Luxbacher

. who was playing in his final game

as a Panther. The second was
scored by right winger Bill Rex.

521-1200
421-4500

Both of the goals resulted from “at”

great deal of effort on the part of
the Panthers. It was extremely
difficult for them to even move the
ball and cracking the Penn State
defense was nearly impossible.
The second half wasn’t much
more than shooting practice for the
Penn State team. They applied
constant pressure on the Pitt
defense. Senior goalie Bill Haines
did all he could to keep the ball out
of the nets. He turned back shot
after shot while trying to stay on his
feet in a foot of mud. Pitt had very
few shots in the second half,
seldom moving the ball past
mid-field. ' ‘

The Pitt booters have now
completed their season which
really couldn’t be considered
successful. Their ﬁnal record was
5-8-1 but Coach Bemis doesn’t feel
the record indicates what type of a
season it was:
