ford College, Illinois, as director of business and industrial

relations at the University of

Stophlet will join the staff of Dr. Albert C. Van Dusen,
assistant chancellor for planning and development, by Jan. 1.
He will be responsible for devel-6

oping programs of mutual interest
between the University and busi-
ness and industry, looking toward

seek to identify needs of business
and industry which can be met
by the University and will recom-
mend programs designed to meet
those needs.

In making the appointment,
Chancellor Litchﬁeld said, “The
past few years have seen busi-
ness and industry, including la-
bor, become increasingly con-
cerned in the training of young
men and women to ﬁll responsi-
ble positions in our American
economy.

~-* “In appointing a man who will

devote full time to programs of
mutual interest in this area, we
are recognizing the tremendous
stake which business and industry
has in higher -education, and the
stake which higher education has
in working with business and in-
dustry to develop programs of
mutual aid and support.”

Mr. Stophlet, a graduate of the
University of Wisconsin, 1941,

' earned the degree of master of

philosophy at Wisconsin in 1946.

Weary-eyed ﬁrst hour stu-
dents last Friday had ample
reason to believe that the day
had a bad start.

The long, gleaming-black
hearse parked in the Univer-

sity driveway on Forbes Street
suggested early-morning tragedy.

Inside the building, a "somber-
faced “mortician” and his two at-
tendants went about their duties
with‘ a deliberate and chilling

~-gnanner .
A One student, entering the
basement cafeteria for early

morning study, was shocked to
see the men in black frocked
coats and Hombergs with the
bronze casket, apparently com‘-
ing from the cafeteria.

Later, a student entering from
the Belleﬁeld side, reported that
the tragic procession approached
him from the direction of the
Chap1ain’s office, “heading toward
the chapel.”

Carefully, the leaden—faced men
carried their burden past a terri-
ﬁed instructress, who dropped her
purse and broke into an" uncon-
trolled sobbing. A puzzled ad-
ministrator hurried into his office
to make a phone call.

There were of course the usual
mfanksters who followed the
procession with a ﬁendish glee.
One such was hollowly rebuffed

for all development and fund
raising activities and a secondary
responsibility for overall ﬁnancial
management. He was concerned
with development of mutually
helpful relations with corporate
and industrial enterprises in the
area and on a national basis with
additional emphasis on programs
of national corporate foundations.
During his years with Rockford
College, support from business
and industry was more than quad-
rupled.

During World War II, follow-
ing his college education ,he

rank of ﬁrst lieutenant with ﬁn-

company publications.

Women To Hold LanternNight;

Program ToiConsist of 2 Parts

Lantern Night, a traditional ceremony which formally
initiates freshman women into life at the University of
Pittsburgh, will be held Friday, Oct. 5, from 7 to 9 p.m.

The program will consist of two parts: the ﬁrst beginning

°at 7 p.m. at Stephen Foster Me-
morial where freshman and their
mentors will assemble to receive
a lantern, inscribed with their
names, as a gift from the Univer-
sity. They will also hear Galliopie
Papandreas, last year’s senior
queen, give the opening ceremon-
ies and history of Lantern Night.

After the opening ceremonies,
the freshmen, dressed in white,
and their mentors in black, will
proceed to the Commons Room
for the conclusion of the cere-
mony. Here their lanterns will be
lit by the February class fresh-
man women, who will act as ﬂame
bearers. They will also listen to
Alma Mater, Louise Lomnicki,
Col. ’57, formally initiate them
into life at the University.

Parents and friends may watch
the ceremony from the second
and third balconies.

Johnstown Center‘ freshman
women will also be present at the
event. They will be served dinner
on the twelfth ﬂoor, and receive
temporary mentors for the eve-
ning.

scribed it as “something different
—and certainly worthy of a top.
grade.”

“I haven’t seen everything yet,”
he added, “but I'm a lot closer
to it."

It might be added that the
authentic corpse that some stu-
dents saw inside the coffin actu-
ally existed. But as it got up after
the domnstration, the corpse put
all fears to rest in its careful ob-
servation: ‘Pitt students never die;
they just go Ivy League."

*—9when the Shriners requested that

the Duke game be played in Nor-
folk, Va., as a charity game in-
stead of at the stadium.

Prior to this, the athletic €0-
partment had invited 1400 cadets
from West Point for the football
game and a closed formal dance
in the Commons Rooms. This ac-
tion breaks a tradition that only
the Christmas Ball be held in the
Commons Room during the school
year.

Dance Imnractical

One of the ‘il‘aC(ll,lO‘¢l events of
homecoming has been an all—U.ni-
versity dance. lvlark Rubenstein,
Col. ’57, chairman of Homecoming
Committee, stated that he be-
lieved that the dance would be
impractical this year since the
athletic department has promised
the 1400 cadets that they will
provide “hostesses" for the dance
from amsng the undergraduate
women of the University. This
would involve one “hostess” for
each cadet. A

Rubenstcin also reported to
Student Congress that a ﬂoat
parade. also traditional. inside
the stadium, would not be al-
lowed at this game. In support
of this assertion. he read let-
ters rcceived by the Dean of

Men’s office. In the ﬁrst of these,

the Alumni Association praised

the students for the part they
played in last year's homecom-
ing.

J. C. Barton, secretary of the
Association, wrote: “I hope that
this year (l955) is the start of
similar homecomings in the fu-
ture.”

The contents of the other letter,
dated Sept. 7, concerned the im-
possibility of a float parade in-
side the stadium this year with a
capacity crowd in the stands.

Cadets To March

Dick Cunningham, assistant to
the dean of men, added that the
cadets will march from Shadyside
station to Pitt Stadium. And with
the ensuing traflic snarl, the police

force would frown upon any at-'

tempt at staging a ﬂoat parade
outside the stadium the morning
of the A?my game.

Student Congress members,
after a lengthy discussion on
possible courses of action, ap-

Police Caution
About Crossing

“Pitt students attending science
classes at Clapp Hall have been
endangering their lives,” said
Lt. Charles Ray, Head of the Uni-
versity’s Police Department. In-
stead of walking down to the red
light, students have been crossing
the street directly in front of
Clapp Hall and stepping out into
fast, on-coming traffic. Actually,
they don't save one step, for the
distance is the same jaywalking
as it is crossing safely at the light.

Lt. Ray pointed out that this
jaywalking was extremely dan-
gerous and cited a recent near-
accident as proof. The solution, he
thought, would be very simple if
they were grade school children
——they would build a fence, but he
“assumed” the intelligence of
college students.

Not only is this jaywalking very
unfair to motorists, bL1t someone
may be killed if it persists. Lt.
Ray stated that unless it stops, it
will be necessary to bring police
enforcement into the picture.

with over three hundred Pitts-.

burgh paralleling the curernt phy-

There they learned from local
leaders of all faiths, races, and
walks of life of the Human Rela-
tions Problems that Pittsburgh

adopted to combat them.

Actual case illustrations, from
the records of the Mayor’s Com-
mission on Human Relations, were
ednsidered. Employment, housing,
and discrimination problems were
thoroughly hashed over.

The visitors were informed that
the “Assembly” is a development
of a meeting held at Aaronsburg,
Pennsylvania, where .in June,
1953, one hundred and ﬁfty of the
country’s most distinguished citi-
zens sat with farmers, teachers,
preachers, housewives, and arti-
sans of Center County to discuss
human relations in all ﬁelds of
daily living, and plan a course of
action for all men of good in-

cause of its rich traditions of

They commented on their trip
as being a true exposure —— to real
American life. American UN ob-
servers took this response as a
good sign, for several of the dele-~
gations were from newly-inde-

rently associating “Nationalism
with anti-Americanism.”

To further the good will gen-

were treated also to a tour of

TV and Education

University of Pittsburgh students should consider them-
selvesifortunate to be within bird’s-eye view of a building
brimming with television opportunities and education. The
building——h_ome of television station WQED—has not been
receiving the recognition itdeserves. Few students, as well
as Pittsburghers generally, realize that QED rates as the
leading educational television station in the world. A look
at the record reveals why.

QED has attempted to succeed in the ﬁeld of direct
teaching via television. This past year, courses in ﬁfth

, grade reading, arithmetic, and French were taught; next

year they plan to include high school physics and ﬁfth grade
history-geography. .

But the programs have not been limited to children.
Adults have been offered a variety of high school courses
for credit with the result that over 2,000 enrollments were
recorded for the 13 subjects given last year. In the com-
ing year, it is planned that college courses will be taught in
history, art, music, and literature.

_ Pitt has played a signiﬁcant part in the station’s pre-
sentations. Besides the faculty members who have played
a large part, a number of Pitt students have participated
on the program “Campus on Call,” a discussion series of
pertinent subjects. Newest feature is “Pitt Huddle,” a foot-
ball specialty emceed by Dr. H. C. Carlson.

All in all, QED is providing the Pitt student withitwo

“important things: direct participation on television and a

chance at an informal type of education right in the liv-
ing room. All students may not be able to beneﬁt from
the ﬁrst opportunity, but the second is theirs for the asking.

Got A Toothache? . -. .

 

Cure Has No’ Office

By Barbara Cherihgton

Buzz—saw noises grate. Men in white coats race
up and down the rows to get amalgam ﬁlling and
root canal points. Peppermint mouthwash smells
are everywhere. Rows of black and white swivel
chairs ﬁll the room. And scores of people are
happier Monday through Friday because they’ve

lost toothaches in the University of Pittsburgh '

Dental School Clinic.

Any human being who is tall
enough to reach the registration
window——and many who aren’t
--to say he wants dental care, is
assigned to a student dentistry,
given an appointment, and invit-
ed into the room of peppermint,
drills and amalgam. ‘

The students are anxious to
receive patients on which to
practice what has been said in class lectures. The
patients are anxious to get at the aches.
Rawness Is Good J ,

Atxﬁrst consideration, the rawness of atmosphere,
noise, informality, and impersonality may seem dis-
tasteful. Many jaw-sore folks desire a quiet little
private office in which to be consoled. And it is
indeed consolation which these f_olks.l_seek, in ad-
dition to physical mending. Most people need a
psychologist as well as a dentist. (And maybe the
psychologist is all they need.) The calm, personal
atmosphere of the doctor’s office does half the work
of the healing.

But let us, for the moment, remove the need for
personal consolation. Perhaps some primary dis-
course may be needed. Nevertheless “your-tooth-
hurts—like—the-devi1—and - if—you-don’t—have—.it-out-

you’ll-die! If you land in a pink and white office,

you’re bound to have a short confab with Dr. . . .
on family feuds, illnesses, and parties before the
tooth’s attended to. (For some people this introduc-
tion to drilling is necessary.)

At the clinic, the patient is escorted into a chair,
the trouble is found, and work starts toute dc suite!

The patient gets a technical explanation of his -

particular case, if he wants it, too.
Call the Doctor

Dental students may call others to observe a
particular lower left molar or right eye tooth.
And, just before ﬁlling a tooth, the student'must
have one of the assigned doctors (Doctors of Dental
Surgery) check that drilled-out spot. .

If the cavity has been suiﬁciently cleared, the
doctor “O.K.’s” a chart on which the patient may
see a picture of where teeth have been ﬁlled an

where they need to be treated.) If the cavity has

not been cleaned away, the student must continue
drillwork until an “OK.” has been placed on the
chart.

What better scientiﬁc method could one desire?
Relief
comes quick and sure as the patient who sees the
method of healing at work.

If psychology is a large part of the job of heal-

ing, I believe this opportunity at the clinic, to hear
one’s particular problem discussed so openly and
to learn about, is the best psychology. '
Perhaps the loud drilling of many students at
work, and the ﬂashes of white coats whizzing by.

Moods and Music       ‘

By Phil Moskol

The prime objective of any
musician is his -ability to recog-
nize the type of music that his
audience would like to hear.
This foresight is only acquired

proach to the ,

T h e C e c i 1
Young Modern
Jazz» Quartet has this great abil-
ity to recognize the moods of
their audiences. This ability
might stem from the fact that the
musicians all have studied music
and have received degrees from
major colleges and universities.
(e.g. Cecil Young—Yale). The
combos extensive musical educa-
tion also brings to light their
ability to improvise and com-
pose. , 0' J
Numbers Recorded

Among the many compositions
that the combo has recorded——- a

 

Dink Stink or . . .

  

French title Monseiur Le Duc

and an» African composition
OOU Diga Gow. I

The combo is composed of a
bass, piano, drums, tenor saxo-
phone and congo and bongo
drums. This combination of
musical instruments plus the
talents of the men has led to
their great success in the jazz
ﬁeld, They have performed with
Stan Getz, Sarah Vaughn, Oscar
Peterson and a number of other
well-known performers. They
have been billed at the Blue
Note in Chicago and in Birdland,
N. Y. J

I am going to try to give you
some idea of the different types
of jazz in the sense that pro-
gressive, modern and dixieland
are all various forms of Jazz.

Progressive jazz is by far the
most complicated of the jazz
group. Progressive jazz is char-
acterized by a free flowing,

-swinging rythm. It is the type

of music that is played by7 Dave
Brubeck, Gerry Mulligan, Chet
Baker and the Modern Jazz
Quartet. These combos play en-
tirely by impressionism. Impres-
sionism is the ability of the
musicians to play exactly the

way_ they feel. The deep effect of
the music is produced by the
piano and the bass constantly
changing chords while the sax
and drums vary the chief notes
and beat.

Modern Jazz

Modern jazz is practically the,\,

same as progressive, but it Varys‘
from soft, easy flowing sounds
to a bongo rhythm which is loud
and steady. The theme of the
number being played is the
most dominant part of the music.
One might classify Ted Heath,
Cecil Young, Jerry Bettors and
The Deuces Wild as modern
musicians. -
The Dixieland type of music is
characterized by the so—calléd 2
beat whereas the drummer ac-
centuates every second heat.
Dixie is chiefly different from

’Progressive and Modern jazz in

the fact that dixie does not have
a sax. -



The true meaning of jazz can
not,.be put into words, it can
only be felt within the indivi-
dual. In other words, jazz will
only be understood when a stu-
dent sits down and listens to a
group of jazz musicians and
“feels” the notes with the per-
forming artist. ‘

An exhibiton of Oskar K0
the stage settings of the 1955

koschka’s original designs for

Salzburg Festival production

of Mozart’s “Magic Flute” opened‘ at the Henry Clay Frick
Fine Arts Department Gallery, University of Pittsburgh, on

_ Monday, Oct. 1.

The exhibition, which will continue through Oct. 22, is

touring United States museums?
and galleries for one year under
the auspices of the Smithsonian
Institute Traveling Exhibition
Service.

In connection with _the ex-
hibition Professor Theodore M.
Finney, Head of the Department
of Music, History and Literature
at Pitt, will discuss the “Magic
Flute” with recordings in the
Fine Arts Gallery on Monday
afternoon, Oct. 8, at 3:30.

These designs were commission-

German conductor Wilhelm
Furtwangler. The 69-year old
Austrian expressionist p a i n t e r,
Kokoschka, has in them captured
the essence of Mozart’s last and
most highly developed operatic
masterpiece. ‘ .

The 32 crayon sketches on view
have been lent by him through
the cooperation of the Minneapolis

American showing was held.

Kokoschka’s stage design were
made for the Falsenreitschule
in Salzburg where no changessof
stage equipment are possible
during performances. Under
these circumstances, Kokoschka
based his solution for changes
of scenery upon lighting effects.
He also solved the usually dif-'
ficult problems of perspective
and depth -by foreshortening
Architecture “in the manner of
the old-fashioned peepshow-
stage.”
Although the application of ex-

a musical work representing the
Viennese rococo might seem a bold
step, Kokoschka has here achieved
this combination with extraor-
dinary success.

NEWSWEEK magazine com-
mented, on seeing the sets, “No
archduke could have objected.
Somehow, without ceasing to be
Kokoschka’s, they seemed to add
some eighteenth-century depth
and gaiety to Mozart’s magic.”

A delightful catalogue with in-
troductions by Kokoschka, Furt-
wangler, and Bernhard Paum-
gartner, with 17 illustration of
the sketches in full color, has been
published.

ler, Col. ’57, that all traditional
homecoming events, e.g., student
dance, pre—game luncheons at
fraternity houses, ﬂoat parade,
and house front decorations, be
held during Homecoming Week
if possible.

This motion was made with the
understanding that Student Con-
gress gives its advance approval
to any of the Homecoming events,
Rubenstein’s committee should be
able to promote.

Committee Planned

The general consensus was that
a central committee of all parties
concerned, the alumni, the chan-
cellor, the athletic department,
and the students, is necessary to
avoid problems of this type in the
future. A letter ot this effect will
be sent to the chancellor.

Dave Bender, Col. ’57, Student
Congress president, announced
that Virginia Van Goethem, Col.
’57, would take the place on
Congress of Phyllis Gall, who
has left the University and Lar-
ry Miller, Col. ’57, would as-
sume the ‘position vacated by
Arnie Sowell, who is in prac-
tice for the Olympics.

Howie Rossen, Col. ’58, chair-
man of the Student Congress ap-
pointments committee, announced
the appointment of Mark Ruben-
stein as Homecoming chairman, as
well as the appointments of Rob-
ert Meldelson, Bus. Ad. ’59, as

Slippery Rock
In Lidlifter

By MURRAY CHASS L
The Slippery Rock Rockets
will host the Pitt soccer squad
this Saturday, Oct. 6, in
the opening meet of the 1956

1 season.

The Rockets will provide a
good test for the Panther booters
as they try to change the results
of the 1955 opener, which Pitt
captured, 4-1. In that one,.Sam
Hazou, then a sophomore, kicked
two goals and also had an assist
to his credit.

Coach Leo Bemis, in his third
season as soccer mentor, thinks
highly of the Slippery Rock
boys, but mainly as a good small
school team. He says. “The
Slippery Rock ‘team is a well-
coached an d well-conditioned
squad. They’re small, but fast
and rugged, and will probably
try to run us off the ﬁeld. If "we
can stop their outsidesofrom
moving the ball upfield we
should take them and get off
to a winning start.”

Pitt’s 1955 leading scorer, Jerry

,Bressanelli, is only a junior, but

he is already being touted for an
All-American post at the inside
left position. Mike Culhane, cielrlitb
Ireland Gaelic football player, is
also a good bet for a place on the
coveted squad. _

Culhane and Hazou give this
season’s team a foreign ﬂavor;
rough Mike coming from Ireland
and Hazou hailing all the way
from Jordan. Culhane will be in
the starting line-up at the center
fullback slot while Hazou will
take the ﬁeld at outside left.

In the ﬁrst year of soccer at
Pitt in 1954, Coach Bemis and
his squad compiled an outstand-

‘ ing 8-1 record; last year they fell

a few notches, their ﬁnal tally
sheet showing 8 wins and 4 de-
feats. Ten games mark this sea-
son’s schedule, four of which will
be played at Kennard Field,'the
booters’ home ﬁeld.

Hoopsters To Play

Two bowl games will high-
light this year’s Panther basket-
ball schedule; not just one as was
featured by last year’s football
schedule. On Dec. 14 and 15, the

‘ Panthers will be featured in the
‘ Steel Bowl,

and Dec. 27-29, it
will be the Orange Bowl, at Mi-
ami.

The locals open their season,
Dec. 1, by journeying to North

Californians Threaten Ambush

With Big, Beefy Forward Wall

BY AL PELAEZ

California fans have a sneaking suspicion that this may
be the week their sleeping giants contact insomnia and play
the type of football they’re capable of playing.

The Bears, who have one of the largest teams in college
football, have yet to enter the win column in their ﬁrst
two games and observers are expectingthem to explode be-

fore long. In their ﬁrst game theyé
_were edged 7-6 by a strong Baylor

team. and last ,week Illinois stop-
ped the Californians 32-20.

In the game with Illini the
Bears piled up a 20-0 lead before
a combination of fumbles and pass
interceptions gave Illinois four
touchdowns and the game. How-
ever, Panther scout Walt Cum-
mins stated that in the ﬁrst half
the Bears were “as good a college
team as I've seen in recent years.”

Bears Lack Depth
. .The Bears have seventeen let-
termen returning from last ye-ar’s
squad which posted a 2-7-1 rec-
ord, including a 27-7 loss to Pitt,
and are vastly improved. They ap-
pear solid enough at the starting
positions but lack depth.
Coach Lynn Waldorf will ﬁeld
a strong, though somewhat slow,
line that should hamper the
Panther’s power plays. The
Bears will be exceptionally
strong at the end positions
which will be manned by Ron
Wheatcroft and Roger Ram-
se_ir. Wheatcroft, a 220 pound
ex-tackle is a deﬁnite All-
American candidate and the
equally gigantic Ramseir is the
holder of Cal’s single game pass
reception record with nine
catches.

The tackles will be large, but
not greatly experienced. Only
Murdo Nicolson has returned from

the tackle positions is indicated,
however, by the fact that Nicolson
hasn’t made the starting lineup
this season. Harley Martin and
Proverb Jacobs, both 240 pound
newcomers to the varsity have
won the starting assignments.

Dr.ew Paces Offense

The center of Cal’s line should
be more than adequate with Frank
Mattarocci at center and Don Gil-
key and Remo Jacizzi at the
guards.

In the backﬁeld, the Bears rely
mainly on Jerry Drew, who
averaged more than nine yards
per carry in 1954, for their
ground attack. Drew, who sat
out last season with an injured
arm, is one of the Coast

°Panthers Seeking Third

West Team

By ED KOLTISKA
Improvement, that’s the word that Coach John Michelo-
sen is spreading around thepractice ﬁeld. at Ellsworth train-
ing center. Although the Panthers chalked up their second
straight’ win last Saturday afternoon by downing Syracuse,
14-7, Michelosen was still dissatisﬁed with the down ﬁeld

blocking of the team. 9

This dissatisfaction s t e m m e d
out of the fact that on numerous
occasions halfbacks Corky Cost
and Jim Theodore had only one
man between them and the goal
line before being stopped after
racking up long gains.

Coach Michelosen will have to
double his effort in this depart-
ment since the Panthers will have
a short work week before ﬂying
to sunny California.

Cummins Rates Bears

The Golden Bears have been
highly rated by Coach Walt Cum-
mins who scouted the California-
Baylor game. “They are one of
the beeﬁest teams we will meet,”
Cummins insisted. “Their line av-
erages 219 pounds. The team ﬁg-
ures are brought down because of
one little chap, Nat Brazill, the
regular left half who stands 5-5
and weighs 145.”

Although the Bears have lost
both of their games to date,
the team has looked very im-
pressive. Last week they led
Illinois 20-0 at half time be-
fore being downed 32-20 at the
ﬁnal gun.

Coach Michelosen will go with
the same starting lineup that has
been so successful to date. Joe
Walton and Dick Scherer will
start at the terminal slots with
Bob Pollock and Herm Canil at
their familiar tackle positions.

Same Backﬁeld Will Start

Vince Scorsone and Dan Wis-
niewski will pair up at the guard
slots. Both Scorsone and Wisniew-

ski have been carrying the burden
at the guard positions due to in-
juries hampering John Guzik and
Dick Carr. Carr, out with a bruised
knee, will be in shape for the
Bear contest.

Chuck Brueckman will handle
the load at center with help being
supplied by Tom Salwocki.

The backﬁeld will be com-
prised of Tom Jenkins at full-
back, Ray DiPasquale and Dick
Bowen at the halves, with either
Corny Salvaterra or Darrell
Lewis getting the, nod at the
quarterback . slot. 9

_ With no injuries received in
last week’s encounter with the
Orangemen of Syracuse, the Pan-
thers will be at full strength for
their ﬁrst away game at Berkley,
California.

 

Entry Shortage Delays
Touch Football Opener

“The lack of entries has caused
postponement of the start of'in-
tramural football,” stated Leo
Bemis, Director of Intramural
Sports.

Mr. Bemis expressed hope that
more teams would enter this week
so that a schedule could be drawn
up and play started by next Tues-
day. Any interested teams should
obtain entry blanks at the Field
House.

Pi Kappa Alpha, champions of
the Inter-Fraternity and Inter-
City Leagues last year, is ready to
defend its titles again this year.

Meet Navy, Villanova Saturday

  Strong Harriers Run

Slippery Rock Today

By MICHAEL GERBER
This week will be a busy one for Coach Carl O1son’s
harriers. They will be seen in action twice. The Panthers,
easy winners over Westminster last Saturday, take on Slip-

\-

, quite u n likely

,pery Rock this afternoon over the Schenley Park Course at

4 p.m. and then journey to Annapolis Friday for a triangular
meet with Navy and Villanova on Saturday.

While the meet with Slippery Rock ﬁgures only as a
tuneup for the highly favored Panthers, it nevertheless will
be/important to Coach Carl Olson. For where Olson had his

runners practice teamwork against¢

Westminster, with no one going
all out to win, he must today pick
his traveling squad of seven run-
ners who will make the trip
to Q n n a polis
Friday.
C The only way
he can do this
is by having
each hill and
daler go all out
to ﬂnish as high
as possible.
Four Panther
barriers s e e m

to be dislodged
from the top
seven. This quartet, which ﬁnished
in a de-ad heat for ﬁrst place in
Saturday’s meet, is composed of
veterans Jimmy Moore and

Thornton Smith, and sophomore
newcomers John Christof and

country teams.

Battling for the other three po-
sitions will be Tom Jessup, Wen-
dell! Harford, Dale Fauser, Ed
Saunders, and a host of-sopho-
mores. Jessup,,Harford, and Fau-

iser seem to have the best chance

of making it.

Not too much is known about

they are coached by Ford Hess,

probably one of the best mentors
in the Tri-State district._

The Rockets were defeated by
Oberlin last Saturday, but two
of their men, Bob Henderson and
Jack Kelly, ﬁnished ﬁrst and third
respectively. However, Slippery
Rock obviously lacks the team
balance to cope with the likes of
the Jungle Cats. '

In the triangular meet on Sat-
urday, the Panthers will be con-
fronted with a much tougher task.
Navy does not ﬁgure as too
formidable an opponent but Villa-
nova is strong. The Wildcats didn’t
lose anyone from the team which
ﬁnished seventh in last year’s
IC4A meet.

Villanova boasts such stalwarts
as Ron Delaney, who will repre-
sent Ireland in the Olympics; Aler
Breckenridge, 19-55 IC4A two-mile
champion from Scotland: John
Kopil, runnerup to Breckenridge
in the two-mile; Al Peterson and
George Brown. Delaney, Breck-
enridge, and Kopil ﬁnished sec-
ond, 15th, and 25th respectively
in last year’s IC4A championship
meet.

Navy, coached by John Gehrdes,
is a young team consisting mostly
of sophomores, which as a team
ﬁgures to be better than last year,
but isn’t expected to press the
Panthers or Wildcats too severely.
The Middies are led by Captain
Walter Meukow, and backed up by

‘Look’ Lands Jock Sutherland,

Michelosen For

Not one, but two coaches,

gence of the Pitt football eleven. In a ﬁve-page spread ap-

pearing in its current edition

Look Magazine names both the present Panther brain, John
Michelosen, and the greatest coach in Panther grid history,

the late Dr. Jock Sutherland,
the credit for the Panthers’ surgeé

Grid "Revival

are responsible for the resur-

(it went on sale yesterday),

as the two men who deserve

back into the national limelight.

The article, “Panther on the
Prowl” by Tim Cohane, reveals
the reason behind the success of
the 1955 team and perhaps the
even greater fortunes that are in
store for this season.

Of course, the role that the
immortal Jock has played in the
Blue and Gold’s quest for power
an indirect one——indirect,
though, only in the sense that
the man who coached the Blue
and Gold to seven Eastern
championships in 15 years is
not h_ere today.

The fact that the Doctor and
Michelson were an almost insep-
arable pair for 14 years in coach-
player, coach-assistant, and ‘fa-
ther—son’ relationships, is enough
to show why Sutherland has such
an inﬂuence on any Michelosen-
coached team.

The one outstanding Sutherland

Young, Less Pglmer, and Tom
Monahan.

characteristic on the gridiron that
Big Mike has retained is his pol-
icy with the players of drive,
drive, and drive some more. “As it
was in Sutherland’s time, so it is
today: Nobody beats Pitt on stam-
ina.” ,

Another Jockism that left its
mark on the Panther head is an
elementary step in recruiting
players—‘look around in your
own backyard.’ He (Michelosen)
has _been able to bring Pitt its
share of the superabundaxit
Western Pennsylvania high
school material . . . he has an
understanding . . . of the pre-
dominant type of boy he is
dealing with, often phlegmatic,
almost invariable, rock-tough of
body, perserving in spirit and
amenable to discipline.”

“Panther on the Prowl” also
presents the interesting story be-
hind Sutherland’s resignation as
coach after the 1938 season, and
why the great Pitt teams of the
l920’s and 1930’s were never able

to draw big crowds at home.

Sewanee Sways
Selecting Seers;

Coffins In News

If anyone spots'a soﬁin walk-
ing around the Commons Room.
don’t be frightened. It’s just the
ghostly PITT NEWS sahibs
carting out the selections for
this week’s. games.

The astounding seers like Pitt,
Army, Yale, and Wake Forest to
win in a romp.

Hey! On second thought that .

coffin might just contain the
only dissenter of the season—-
Rosey Ray. Last week Itosey

picked Syracuse to upend the
Panthers because as she put it,
“I knew if I picked the Orange-
men to win the Panthers would
come through.”

The “Game of the Weak”
takes place in the heart of Dixie
between the Millsaps Majors
and the Sewanee Tigers. All of
the majestic selections predict
the Tigers to discipline the Ma-
jors in the South’s greatest bat-

’ tle since the Civil War.

When the selecting Seers
found the Millsaps-Sewanee tilt
listed on the board they imme-
diately joined
singing “Way Down Upon the
Sewanee River” except Butch-
ock. Says Butchock: “Only a sap
wouldn’t pick Millsaps.”
