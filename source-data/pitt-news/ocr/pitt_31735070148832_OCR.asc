develop
model   

tests

Tegan Hanlon
Assistant News Editor

Elementary school children might
soon take tests designed by Pitt
professors — at their grade level,
of course.

The Partnership for the As-
sessment of Readiness for College
and Careers awarded Pitt a $1.5
million contract to develop pro-
totype student assessments and
instructional tasks for the English
language arts and literacy common
core standards that most states
have adopted in recent years.

Pitt’s Institute for Learning’s
English Language ‘Arts team, which
is part of the University’s Learning
Research and Development Center,
and faculty and graduate students
from the School of Education will
develop the assessments for grades
3, 6 and 10. ,

PARCC is a consortium of states
committed to creating “high-qual-
ity assessments that measure the
full range of the Common Core
State Standards,” according to the
group’s website.

Nancy Israel, the executive di-
rector of the Institute for Learning,
said that Pitt signed the contract
with PARCC earlier this month.
She said larger educational testing
companies can also opt to use the
model developed by Pitt.

Professors speakon Arab Spring, media

Tiffany Grossi
Staﬂ” Writer

While people around the world
have followed the Arab Spring
through social media, Pitt pro-
fessor Mohammed Bamyeh wit-
nessed the revolution ﬁrsthand.

“I was on sabbatical during
that time, and I went to Cairo
expecting a revolution,” Bamyeh
said.

The sociology professor told
his story at “Digital Media in the
Arab Spring” Tuesday afternoon
in the Cathedral of Learning. Po-
litical science professor Michael
Goodhart also spoke at the fo-
rum, whichwas hosted by Digital
Media at the University of Pitts-
burgh, to an audience of about
40 people about the effects that
social media can have on social
movements.

“I confess that I don’t know

much about the Arab Spring or
social media, but I do know about
democracy,” Goodhart said, not-
ing that social media can alter the
landscape of a revolution by pro-
viding a tool of coordination, as
it did in the Arab Spring.

The Arab Spring — a series
of demonstrations in the Arab
world that began in December
2010 — reached Egypt in Janu-
ary 2011. Many demonstrations
were organized through Facebook

l=#iz_~§s‘u.=n i§‘2..:t3 £1"-trig

and Twitter. Egyptian citizens de-
manded the overthrow of then-
President Hosni Mubarak, who
had led the country for almost 30
years. He officially" resigned from

Iofﬁce on Feb. 11.

Bamyeh highlighted the sense
of individuality that consumed
the demonstrations in Egypt, not-
ing the uniqueness of the hand-
made signs that Egyptian citizens
held throughout the protests. He

New educational standards

bring need for   assessments  

Contract ( 1

“If you just leave it up to the testing com-
panies, they may not come up with some-
thing different and new,” Israel said.

The assessments Pitt researchers develop
will reﬂect the new Common State Standards
Initiative, a state—led effort that deﬁnes what
students are expected to learn in grades K-12
in order to be career and college-ready. In
the past, each state had its own process for
developing educational standards, but the
Common State Standards Initiative would
make the standards uniform across states.

So far, 45 states have adopted the stan-
dards. Pennsylvania adopted the standards
injune 2010. The introduction of the Com-

, mon State Standards has created a need for
a change in the assessment model that tests

students’ knowledge.

Laura Slover is the senior Vice President
of Achieve, a nonproﬁt education reform
organization, and the project management
partner for PARCC. Slover said that PARCC
is in need of prototype models that evalu-
ate students’ understanding of common
core standards, including hard—to—measure
standards like “critical thinking and writing
using evidence from sources.”

“The University of Pittsburgh was se-

lected based on its expertise in this area,”
she said in an email.

Anthony Petrosky, associate dean of
academic programs in Pitt’s School of Edu-
cation, is the principal investigator for the
contract. Lindsay Matsumura, a faculty
member in Pitt’s School of Education, will
direct ﬁeld—site testing with the help of two
other members from IFL and LRDC.

Matsumura said that the team is just get-
ting started with ﬁeld testing, which will be
conducted in schools across the nation.

She said that while the model is still in
the works, it will be a more comprehen-
sive assessment system not constrained to
multiple choice questions. Matsumura said
that the team is “trying to do more innova-
tive performance-type tasks,” which may
include things like more extended writing
sections. '

Israel said that the team will complete
ﬁeld testing byjune and have reports on the
testing, which will include interviews with

teachers and students after the assessment .

is given, by November 2012.
“It’s exciting to be engaged, to be doing

something that is so important in terms of

 

educational policy,” Matsumura s_aid.

Three hydration stations

planned for campus

Michael Ringling
Staff Writer

Studiouslstudents no longer need to fear
dehydration 4 or at least the inconve-
nience of using a water fountain to fill
a bottle. ‘
Environmental Committee Chair Re-
becca Schroeder announced the instal-
lation of two new hydration stations in
the Hillman Library at the Student Gov-
ernment Board meeting Tuesday night
at Nordy’s Place. The 16-minute meeting
marked the Board’s second—to—last public

meeting before the newly elected Board

takes overin January.

Schroeder said that the installation of
the two stations is currently under way on
the ground ﬂoor and ﬁrst ﬂoor. She esti-
mated that each. machine costs between
$400 and $500, funded by the Univer-
sity’s Facilities Management budget. The
hydration stations will be installed on
already—existing water fountains. Students
can place their reusable water bottle in

front of a sensor that triggers a spigot ,

to reﬁll it.

The two Hillman stations come in ad-
dition to the current station located on
theﬁrst floor of the William Pitt Union,
which Schroeder said has been used more
than 15,700 times since installation this
summer. By the end of this semester, an-
other station, funded by Pitt’s Housing
Department, will be installed in Suther-
land Hall-.

In further efforts to go green, Board
member Ryan Gayman announced a pro-
posal to add a sixth article to the SGB by-
laws that would formally recognize the
Student Sustainable Projects Committee
andgrename the group the Green Fund Ad-
visory Board. The proposed bylaw states
that “The Student Government Board’s
Green Fund Advisory Board (GFAB) is
responsible for soliciting and evaluating
proposals to make the University of Pitts-
burgh a more sustainable institution.”

“It is important to have it in the by-
laws,” Gayman said. “What is really cool
is that anyone who has an idea can come
to thiscommittee.” i ‘

Demonstrators use

Media 4 1

Egyptian words for “get out” were spelled
out in rocks, calling for.Mubarak and his
regime to step down. _
“There was a lack of uniformity and
mass production that we see in many politi-
cal demonstrations,” he said. “The revo—
lution was collective, yet everyone had a
chance to show their own individuality.”
In an act of unity, Egyptian citizens came
together to reform the national ﬂag, which
now has a new symbolic combination of
a cross and crescent moon and the tradi-
tional colors of red, white and black.
Citizens young and old participated
in the protests, Bamyeh said. While the
younger generation drew pictures and
communicated through social media, the
older generation posted handmade decrees
online listing the misdeeds of the military
regime for the entire public to see.
“Networking matters when it taps into a
long—felt sentiment held by many people,”
Goodhart said_. “Other people share the
same concerns and social media gets the
word out.” . I
Three days into the revolution, the
Egyptian government noticed the over-
whelming reaction to‘ social media. They
attempted to shut down the Internet and
other communication systems in orderto
prevent the delegitimization of the military
regime; Ironically, the process in itself was

social media to organize

delegitimizing, Goodhart said.
He spoke about the dilemma that the
business and religious leaders who had

once monopolized Egypt encountered. '

They now had to confront a powerful
wave of criticism released through social
media.

“If [social networking] is open and par-
ticipatory, does it automatically make it
inherently democratic?” he said.

Bamyeh also emphasized the sense of
utopia that Tahrir —— the main square in
Egypt where the demonstrations took place
—- provided. In the square, he said that

- there were multiple stages set up, with

people waiting in line to give political
speeches, read poems and sing.
Goodhart said that the Occupy_moVe—
ments should use Tahrir as a model for
their demonstrations, especially in terms
of the individuality and uniqueness of the
Egyptian revolution. ' ’
Denisse Sequeira, a junior majoringin

neuroscience and religious studies, said ‘

she appreciated the comparison of the two
movements. ' I
“I ﬁnd it very interesting to compare
past and current revolutions along with
the similarities between Occupy Wall Street
and Tahrir,” Sequeira said at the forum. “If
I hadn’t come to this event, I would have
never thought of that connection.” I

Board 4 2 _

Students can propose ideas to the com-
mittee that focus on ways to make Pitt’s
campus more sustainable. The GFAB would
be responsible forallocating a “Green
Fund” in the sum of $2,500. Themoney
would come out of the Environmental
Committee’s $2,500 portion of SGB’s
$44,551.02 ﬁscal budget. SGB would be
the ﬁnal authority in the allocation of the
fund, and the justification for the decision
must be made publicly.

The Board automatically tabled the
proposal until next week. Gayman urged
students to check out the initiative online
and talk to the Board members if they
have any thoughts or comments on the
proposal.

Job discrimination
against obese OK

It’s no surprise that people are fre-
quentlyjudged by their appearances.
And perhaps one of the most sensi-
tive qualities people notice about
you is your weight. That makes for
tons of pressure to look a certain
way.

And after last night’s Victoria’s
Secret Fashion Show, many women
might be feeling down about their
‘own body types. No, being model-
thin isn’t the norm, but being over-
weight certainly subjects one to
social stigmas.

People might view larger people -

as lazy, food—obsessed or unglamor—
ous. And these stereotypes deﬁnite-
ly don’t describe most overweight
people. But this begs the question:
Should discrimination against fat
people be illegal‘?

It isn’t illegal for employers to
{discriminate against applicants
based on their weight. Unlike sex,
race and other protected classes,
obesity isn’t covered by anti-dis-
crimination laws. It could be argued
that this is unfair, but we think the
decision should be left to employers
and kept out of government legisla-
tion.

The New York Times says that
obese — 20 percent or more above
the normal body weight range ——-
people are more likely to miss work-
days and cost employers more in
the long term. Being signiﬁcantly
overweight increases one’s risk of
preventable chronic diseases like
diabetes, and employers can usu-
ally connote one’s weight with the
amount of health care he or she
needs.

People who are obese because of
existing health or genetic issues are
protected by the American Disabili-
ties and the Genetic Information
Nondiscrimination acts. Thus, those
who cannot help their body compo-
sitions have legal protection.

Also, overweight people pose
great ﬁnancial risks to companies

 

because they require more health
care and are prone to work-related
injuries. According to a Duke Uni-
versity study, overweight workers
had lost 13 times more workdays
because of work-related injuries,
and their medical claims for those
injuries were seven times costlier
than their normal-weight cowork-
ers. .

It might seem unfair, but em-
ployers should retain the right to
make the best ﬁnancial decisions for
their workplaces. And since hiring
a larger person could mean hiring a
person with potential health risks,
we think employers should be able
to make decisions that are in the
best interests of their companies.

If employers comply with the
law, they are already doing what
they need to in order to ensure a
sort of moral code. But this could be
enhanced —— and some companies
already do this — with health and
ﬁtness incentives. Offering more
beneﬁts to employees who work
to improve their health could give
qualiﬁed but obese employees the
drive to get healthy. The result?
Lower health care costs in favor of
good health.

This is not to say that unhealthily
overweight people have no worth. In
fact, employers could miss out on
great ideas and talent if they decide
to judge their employees solely on
appearance. But ultimately, the ﬁnal
say in an employer’s decision mak-
ing should be his or her own.

The fact is that the habits charac-
teristic of overweight people should
be broken. And in the midst of the
obesity “epidemic,” "addressing the
work force is a worthy step to pro-
mote better health. We don’t need
the government to get involved.

People will always judge you
based on your appearance. But cry-
ing “discrimination” is merely an
attempt to shield America from its

How to fix most common
texting problems in stvle

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

 
  

Although texting might be the ﬁnest
and most perfectform of communica-
tion yet devised by mankind, it never-
theless poses grave diﬁiculties for the

unwary. Given the demands imposed f

tenﬁndthemselves s'7' friends 

alienatingpeoplewi tlieirmconlsid-j ‘
erate or long—winded replies. In" the

interest of ensuringthatyour holidays
remain cheerful, we’ve decided to pro-
vide our can’t—miss solutions to some of
the mostvexingtextingproblems now
-facingthis great nation of ours.

1. The difference of opinion: Let’s
say you’re just minding your own
business, trying not to have a single
meaningﬁil tl1oughtasyou while away
the day. Suddenly your reverie is inter-
rupted with a question that demands
not only your time, but also a modest
amount of mental engagement

urfriend: dude my bros are arguin
wit me cause Ithinkspider—man3 isthe
best one.ugot ‘my back‘? ,

Oh god, howto respond?Although
it’s unclear why your ﬁiend has come
to believe that “Spider-Man 3” is the
bestﬁlm in that series, you don’t want
to hurt his feelings by explaining how
tedious and inane you thought it was.
Furthermore, given that you’re about
to achieve another high score in Be-

jeweled Blitz, you haven’t the time for
a lengthy response. We recommend
cutting this Gordian Knot as follows:

u: idk man ‘ ' F

With this simple acronym, you’ve
let your friend know that you value
his opinion deeply. You’ve said, “Hey
man, Icareforyouso muchthatltook
time outofmyday—— adaywhereI’ve
been setting one Bejeweled Blitz high
score after another — to type a six-
letter response to your query. You’re
arealpal. But—_andadmit1ingthis is
going to cut like a knife, as described
in the Bryan Adams song ‘Cuts Like a
Knife’ — I don’t have an answer for
you.” So much poignant emotional
content in so little space — isn’t tex-
tingwonderﬁil?

2. The honest mistake: OK, here’s
onethathappensallthetime. It’s5p.m.
on a Monday aﬁernoon, and you’re
dragﬁng yourself out of bed as you

 

try to put the kibosh on a hangover

‘ from hell. You realize it’s been three

days since you last chilled with the
person you’re daﬁng, so you ﬁre off
aquick text:

ursigniﬁcantother: Huh? I was
 my dying grandmother at the
hospice on Friday. What are you talk-
ing about?

Uh oh, Spaghettiosl Seems like
you’ve been up to no good, friend. But
don’t worry: There’s an easy way to
not only excuse this faux pas but to
come out looking even better for hav-
ingmade it: I

u=J'k

ursigniﬁcantother: You are too
funny!

See? After seeing that well-timed
“jk,” the person you’re dating now
thinks you’re aregularRobinWilliams
when it comes to the laughs and the
wit and the humor and whatnot. That

. person certainly doesn’t suspect you

of getting hammered on 151 and fool-
ing around with someone else in the

‘ back of your moms Buick Skylark, no

3. The perfect excuse: Ifyou’re any-
thing like us, you’re typically 45 min-
utes to anhour late foreveryscheduled

hurly-burly of school life anyway‘? It’s
been so hecticwitliallthedassesyotfre
missing and the sleep you’re catching
up on that it’s perfectly understandable
that you were unable to drag yourself
out of bed and make it to whatever it
was you were supposed to do. But the
people who have your digits might not

sendyou someangrytacts aboutyour
habitual absenteeism: ,

Admittedly, that was a rather
lengthytext. In our opinion, your texts
should never exceed ﬁve words —— any-
thing longer is “tl;dr.” But a situation

' like this — where some jerk is trying
to make you feel crummy on account
of the fact that you’re a lazy, forgetful
loser who can’t even show up on time
for your own birthday party — calls
for desperate measures. Once the
original texter reads your elaborate,
airtight excuse, he’ll undoubtedly want
to apologize to you. And he’d be justi-
ﬁed indoingso, because it’s been really
hard for you lately.

4. Season’s greetings: Here’s alime-

' to avoid talking to your parents. Now

that the holiday season is upon us, it
seems inevitable that you’re going to

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Pitt dominates defensively,“
defeats Mountaineers

R] Sepich
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team
cruised to awin over Mount St. Mary’s

. on'Iuesdaynight, holdingtheMoun-

taineers scoreless for more than six
minutes at the start of the game.

The Panthers’ swarming de-
fense didn’t stop there. Head coach
Agnus Berenato’s team dominated
the contest defensively, limiting the
Mountaineers (2-4) to a miniscule
30.5 percent shooting and forcing
20 turnovers as Pitt (4-2) picked up
a 58-45 victory.

“We just preach defense,” sopho-
moreforward KyraDunn said. “AndI
thinkwe did really well defensivelyto
convert on our steal opportunities.”

The Panthers started strong, jump-
ing outto a 12-0 lead even with leading
scorer Marquel Davis sittingoutwith
a concussion.

By the time the Mountaineers
ﬁnally scored on a layup with about
13:30 remainingintheﬁrsthalf, they
had already missed nine shots and

turned the ball over ﬁve times.

“We talked about how the ﬁrst
ﬁve minutes were really important,”
Berenato said. “Our press was pretty
active and forced a lot of tumovers,
which led to a lot of buckets. You al-
ways have to jump on them.”

The Mountaineers slowly climbed
their way back into the game during
the ﬁrst half. Senior Sandra Andres-
son’s bucket in the ﬁnal minute cut
the Panthers’ lead to seven heading
into the break.

But in the beginning of the second
half, Pitt responded with another run
that effectively ensured the Panthers’
victory.

Pitt redshirt sophomore guard
Ashlee Anderson made herteam’s ﬁrst
3—pointer of the game and quickly add-
ed a layup before freshman guard Bri-
annaKiesel drained another 3—pointer
to stretch the Pitt lead out to 15.

Anderson, who started in place
of Davis, almost earned a triple-dou-
ble. She ﬁnished with a game—high 13
points and tallied career—highs with
nine rebounds and seven assists.

“It’s always good to start,” Ander-

son said. “Iwas kind of happy because
I hadn’t seen my face up on the [lum-
botron] in awhile. And I didn’t even
know I was close to a triple-double.”

With Pitt’s signiﬁcant size ad-
vantage and a tough defense that
prevented Mount St. Mary’s from’
stringing a scoring run together, the
Mountaineers didn’t climb any closer
than nine points forthe remainder of
the game.

The Panthers combined to grab
42 rebounds, including a team—high~s_
12 boards from Dunn.

“I thought that Kyra really made
great strides,” Berenato said. “She
hadatremendous amount oftips and
blocks — her intangibles helped us to
get ahead.”

The Panthers, who are coming off:
a21-point loss to Drexel last Saturday,
haven’t lost back-to-back games yet
this season. This weekend, Pitt will
play its-ﬁrst road games of the year
at High Point and Duke.

“Iwas proud of our team for com!-.-
ing out strong, especially after a de-
feat,” Berenato said. “I wasn’t sure how
this team would rebound.”

GREGORIAN RANTS

Predicting

the winner
of the AFC
North

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ“ Writer

So who wins the AFC North?
The AFC playoff race isn’t much of a race

at the moment. The New England Patriots

have a two-game lead on the New Yorkjets in

' the AFC East. In the AFC South, the Houston A

Texans -.—- now accepting quarterback appli-
cations + should limp into the postseason
over Tennessee. And in the mediocre AFC
West, well, have you not heard about Tim
Tebow? Either his Broncos or the Oakland
Raiders will take the division crown.

That leaves the AFC North, which features
the 8-3 Baltimore Ravens, the 8-3 Pittsburgh
Steelers and the 7-4 Cincinnati Bengals. If the

playoffs started today, all three would make’

the postseason, and the other three divisions
would complain that the North was “hogging

all the wild card spots, ma!”

With ﬁve weeks remaining, the race for
the AFC North title might be the most en-
tertaining battle the conference has to offer
— because, really, the AFC West is more fun
to watch in theory than it is in reality.

Week 13

Baltimore plays at Cleveland, which is

28th in the league in scoring and hasn’t

beaten a team with a winning record this
season. Joe Flacco can have an off day, and
the Ravens would still win 6-3.

Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, meanwhile,
face each other in a 1 p.m. Heinz Field match-

7-5, they run the risk of losing their strangle-

hold on the last wild card spot. Although the A

Steelers are formidable at home (4-1), let’s
say Andy Dalton leads the Bengals to a cru-
cial victory just to keep things interesting.

ers and Bengals at 8-4.

The Steelers host the Cleveland Browns
on Thursday night. Both teams will have a
short week, so neither side has an advantage
there. The Browns will drop this primetime
matchup against Pittsburgh for the same
reasons they will lose to the Ravens. Luckily
for them, those without the NFL Network
can’t criticize their play this time.

Pittsburgh has another night game when

the Rams, which play_ Pittsburgh on Christ-

streak, and 11-4 Cincinnati, ona ﬁve-game"
winning streak. But the Ravens actually-have
the division wrapped up. They beat the Ben-
gals in November, and even, if Cincinnati
wins here, the tiebreaker shifts to divisional
records. Baltimore would enter 5-0 in the
division, while Cincinnati would enter 3-2.

(As this is sorted out, Pittsburgh beats

Cleveland, moves to 11-5 and clinches the i

No. 6 seed.)‘ A _

At home, Dalton and the Bengals make
one last regular-season statement and upset
the Ravens, 31-24. All three teams make the
playoffs, and Baltimore has the ﬁrst-round

are the ones with all the momentum entering
the postseason. I
