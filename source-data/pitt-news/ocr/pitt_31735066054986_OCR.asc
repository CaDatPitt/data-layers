The Student Government Board voted last
night to try to get nearly $15,000 worth of

student activity fees to buy computer equip-

ment for its office.

During last night’s SGB meeting, the
board members addressed their need for in-
house computers. In years past, equipment
for student groups has been purchased by
using money from the student activity fee,
but the allocations chair said the university
should pick up the tab.

“I feel it is the external responsibility of
the university,” said Brian Kavalukus.

SGB President Andy Wuertele said it’s
important to get the computer system,
regardless of who pays for it. ’

“We feel it’s an appropriate expenditure,”
Wuertele said after the meeting.

During the open-ﬂoor session after the
meeting, Janera Solomon, who ran for SGB
president in the last election, said she thinks

Library gives amnesty

By Nicole Wilson

For  News '   "

As part of Carnegie Library's 100 year anniversary celebration,
the historical landmark is handing out a belated birthday present of
its own - a 100-day amnesty on overdue materials. '

The amnesty, from Jan. 1 through April 10, 1996, allows patrons
to retum late items without a fine, and without guilt.

“We’_ll accept [the overdue materials] with a smile — no ques-
tions asked,” said Deputy Library Director Loretta O’Brien.

O’Brien said the 100 days of forgiveness celebrates the centenni-
al through a “good will gesture" to patrons of the Carnegie Library.
“Our main message is that we want our resources to be available,”
she said.

“We want our patrons to be able to continue to use our wealth of
information and services,” said Library Director Robert B.
Croneberger. ,

These resources and services are available to any Pitt student
with a valid Pitt ID and proof of address. Nearly 3,700 university
students throughout Pittsburgh are cardholders at the Carnegie
Library. _

“Pitt students are an important part of our user base here,” said
O’Brien, “and we would be appreciative if they would bring back
any overdue books.” .

“It’s easy to forget’ the book left under the bed or in the trunk of
the car until it’s overdue. Patrons tend to be too embarrassed to
return overdue materials,” said Croneberger.

But, unretumed books are a~costly loss, according to O’Brien.
The Carnegie Library pays to replace _them, but it cannot replace

‘books that are no longer in print. O’Brien said the arrmesty helps, to

decrease such loss by encouraging patrons to return materials.

' This amnesty is not a new experiment for the Carnegie-Library. It
offered other such forgiveness periods in 1970, 1983 and 1989.
Though each lasted only one week, the average number of returns
during these amnesties was 22,000. g _

The 100-day period granted this time represents the Carnegie
Library’s 100 years, said O’Brien. Also, she added, “It allows
enough time for the procrastinators to return their overdue books.”
And they can do so without the usual ﬁve—cent-per-day ﬁne.

Returns thus far have not been as numerous as with the previous
amnesties, but O’Brien said she expects that “it will pick up.”

“Here’s your chance to clear your library card and your con-
science,” said Croneberger. “We’l1 appreciate your returns, and so
will the other patrons we serve.” .

Books, videotapes and audiotapes can be returned to the Main

Library and all Carnegie Library branches in Pittsburgh.

Health Fair is back

‘ ByCes‘ca Antonelli’ "

Staff Writer

The Pitt Student Health Service has united the campus and
community again, this time behind the banner of “Resolution:
Make Wellness Stick,” for its 12th armual Health Fair today,

which runs from 11 am. to 4 p.m. in the Assembly Room of tl1e_

Wﬂliam Pitt Union. . '

Numerous community groups, like the Allegheny County
Health Department and Forbes Fitness Center, and campus orga-
nizations have come together to help provide students with infor-
mation about how to stay healthy, how to eat right and how to
use health services available both on and off campus. The Health
Fair is free and open to the public.

“It’s an opportunity for students to pick up information on dif-

ferent health resources here on campus and close by and increase

their own awareness of health issues,” said Shirley Haberman,
the event coordinator and health education administrator

In addition to pamphlets and ﬂyers about health—re1ated ser-
vices and current issues like exercising and sexually transmitted
diseases, there will be stations where campus and community
groups can interact with students and other participants.

“It’s interactive  the concept [of a Health Fair] came about in
the late ‘70s within communities and community groups. Ours is
more oriented for college students, more prevention-oriented
than illness—oriented. It’s about staying healthy. There will be
some ﬁtness testing going on at the Health Fair aswe .” said
Habennan.

The Health Fair also offers health screening, including blood
pressure and body fat percent. Students can also receive coupons
and appointments from the Pitt Dental School. '

Haberman hopes to provide an upbeat environment where stu-
dents can getthe information they need while enjoying them-
selves, so there will be another attraction accompanying the ser-
vices and information —— fnee stuﬁ. Gift packs and coupons will
be given away, and prize drawings for area merchandise will be
held. Students can also take advantage of free snacks.

There will be several forms of entertaimnent as well. Radio
stations WNRQ 104.7 and Pitt’s own WPTS 92.1 will provide
music. The Pitt Jazz Band and Dance Ensemble will both per-
form, and there will be an aerobic demonstration. Beautiful
Hands, a music and dance review which integrates sign lan-
guage, will also perform.

Haberman said that 2,400 people attended the Health Fair last
year as a way to have a good time. take a break from classes and
stay informed all at the same time.

If you ask for the funds, the

Solomon said about the need
for Pitt to pay for the comput-

Wuertle, will be used to hook
up the SGB office with the
rest of the campus.

The next step in the alloca-
tions process will be a review
by the allocations committee
to see if it will give the SGB
the $14,663 it is requesting for

“At this point, we didn’t
vote ourselves any money,”
Wuertele said.

The lack of cooperation the
Food Service Committee is
receiving from Marriott was
also discussed at the meeting.
The Food Service Committee
said that according to Betsy
Salade-Farina, documents per-
taining to the contract between
Food Services and Marriott
are confidential. This limits
student access to how the
money is spent.

Bannister said that because
student funds are used for the
service, students have the
right to access this informa-
tion. Due to the widespread
concern about ongoing
changes in the meal plan, he
encouraged the Food Service A
Committee to take a more
active role in pressing the
matter.

Bannister is also pursuing
the lack of computer network
ports in residence halls which -
would enable students to have
e-mail and Netscape at their

Medicaid abortions

The Supreme Court has been ‘busy this weekend, handing
down three major decisions in the past two days. The
biggest decision was one which refused to let the state of

‘ Pennsylvania dictate rules regarding Medicaid-funded abor-

trons.

Pennsylvania had, until now, required that women who
were victims of rape or incest report the crime to the police
as well as identify their attackers in order to get funding
from Medicaid for an abortion. Women whose lives were
threatened by their pregnancies had to have a second opin-
ion of their case from another doctor before Medicaid
would pay for an abortion.

Federal guidelines for Medicaid-funded abortions also
required that women report incidents of rape or incest.
However, the federal rule allowed for a waiver if a
woman’s doctor believed she had- been too physically or
psychologically hurt to report the crime. Federal law also
does not require a second opinion if the woman’s life is at
risk.

Since Pennsylvania’s requirements were so much more
strict than federal ones, three Philadelphia-based organiza-

tions took the state to court, challenging the rules. Lower

courts twice held the rules to be in conflict with federal
guidelines before the matter found its way into the Supreme
Court. ,

Hoping to find a friend in what many thought to be a con-
servative Court, Pennsylvania’s lawyers argued that federal
guidelines were too vague to override the Pennsylvania law.
However, the Court didn’t agree. Without issuing a formal
written comment, the Court upheld the Third U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals’ decision that the state of Pennsylvania
must provide funds for any abortion which would be cov-
ered by federal guidelines.

The Court made the right decision. It is not the state’s
place to say who is and who is not capable of making a
report to the police. Rape and incestcan be so psychologi-
cally damaging that many women do not speak at all after
their attack, let alone to the police. .

Also, rape and incest are crimes that carry a certain stig-

ma, and too many people (wrongly) hold the victim of these '

crimes to blame.eMany women are- too embarrassed to
admit they have been victims of rape or incest, afraid they
will have to endure a defense attorney’s accusations of
promiscuity (which‘shouldn’t‘even be allowed into the
court during rape and incest trials) and of “leading the
attacker on. She asked for it, right?” Wrong, but these
things will be said anyway, and many women are more
afraid of that than of letting their attacker go free.

Finally, the state does not have the right to tell (in
essence) a woman that she must die because she cannot
afford to have a life—saving abortion. If a woman’s life is at
risk, Medicaid should cover it. No second opinion is neces-
sary to tell if a life is in danger, and the state has no right to
make this kind of demand.

VVhy government is in gridlock

In 1964, just 32 years ago, an
astonishing 85 percent of the
American people said that they
had confidence in the govem-
ment to do what was right always
or most of the time. In the years

since then, this number has fallen '

steadily to the point where in
December of 1993, just 15 per-
cent of the American people had
conﬁdence in the government.

In 30 years, 70 percent of the
American people lost faith in the
govemment’s ability to do any-
thing correct, and they have
every right to feel this way. Our
government is too bureaucratic
and too unresponsive to the
needs of the citizens of America.
Unfortunately, the Republicans in
Congress have seized upon a
variety of ideas that don’t work
in an effort to reform the govem-
ment.

The 1993 budget is a classic
example of how difficult it is to
reform the government. President
Clinton tried to eliminate 200
items totaling $160 million from
within the Department of
Agriculture’s budget. Despite
giving a tough fight, Clinton
ended up only managing to elim-
inate three dozen items worth
$38 million. Clinton managed to

cut more fat than George Bush“

did, but it still amounted to just
1/2000 or 0.05 percent of the
departrnent’s budget. _

Several members of Congress
in recent years have suggested
reducing the subsidy that ranch-
ers receive for grazing their cattle
upon federal land. Ranching
groups descended upon
Washington, D.C., and laid siege
upon Capitol Hill, labeling land
reformers “socialists” (despite
the fact that refonners are trying
to privatize the federal land sys-
tem) bent on “cultural genocide.”
President Clinton tried to reduce
the subsidy twice but was beaten
off.

The time and effort that is
needed to reduce wasteful pro-
jects like the ranching subsidy
makes it not worth the effort.

, Ironically enough,. despite.

Michael
Berqurst

Republican branding of Clinton
as a liberal, he will most likely go
down in history as the most con-
servative Democratic president
of the 20th century.

The current Congress claims to
be working towards streamlining
the government, but for some
curious reason the Congress
recently voted to fund NASA’s
space station with $30.4 billion
over five years. Why did the
space station, the very symbol of
Washington pork, survive? In
part because actor Tom Hanks
and astronaut Jim Lovell (the
man whom Hanks portrayed in
the movie Apollo 13 ) came to
Washington and lobbied
Congress to fund the station.
Star-struck, Congress promptly
knuckled under and voted to
keep the project, which also pro-

_vides jobs to several lawmakers’

districts.

So what is the answer? How
do we eliminate the powerful
hold special interest groups have
on our govemment? Term limits
are the excuse mentioned usually,
and it is a nice idea: Forbid pro-
fessional politicians from running
for public ofﬁce, and people ded-
icated to cutting waste will take
over. Unfortunately, this simplis-
tic answer to such a complex
problem doesn’t work in the real
world.

Term limits would force out
such peopleas Senator Richard
Lugar and Congressman Charles
Schumer, two men who have
done the most in the past decade
to eliminate farm subsidies: an
enormous cash cow that drains
about $10 billion of the govem-
ment’s money each year and ben-
efits 300,000 already wealthy
agribusinessmen. Congressman
Schumer recently wrote a bill
which would totally eliminate
various farm subsidies, and
Senator Lugar’s Presidential plat-

form calls for eliminating farm

subsidies altogether.
I should point out that

Congressman Schumer is cur-
rently serving his eighth terrn in
Congress and Senator Lugar is
on his fourth term in the Senate.
Also, Congressman Schumer and
Senator Lugar’s plans are bitterly
opposed by the Freshmen
Republican caucus, which has

fought to make sure farm subsi- '

dies are protected. According to
the cartoonish logic of term lim-
its supporters, people like
Congressman Schumer and
Senator Lugar should be ﬁghting
to support subsidies, while fresh-
men Republicans would be elim-
inating them. In the real world,
however, things are different.
Block grants aren’t the answer
either. Several states have experi-
mented with block grants, and
they were anything but success-
es. Block grants don’t guarantee

that the money is spent any better '

by local governments than by the
federal government. All that they
guarantee is that a bureaucrat in
Harrisburg spends the money
instead of a bureaucrat in
Washington, D.C. The GOP’s
embrace of the politically fash-
ionable 10th Amendment and
block grants lacks an intelligent
rationale. Even an individual
with the IQ of Forrest Gump can
see that all the Republicans are
doing is shutting down one
bureaucracy and building 50
smaller ones.

The GOP’s cherished state
governments are little more than
band-aids which help to avoid
the real and unpleasant reality
that something must be done to
change the way government does
business. If not, the government
can never be the place where
Franklin D. Roosevelt’s dream of
“bold, persistent experimenta-
tion” can ever take place, and the
American people will continue to
suffer for it It just goes to show
that the age-old adage “the more
things change, the more things
stay the same” holds more truth
than ever.

Pitt hangs tough with the

No. 1 team in the /and, but
falls 7 9-7 7 in overtime

By Sean Duncan
Managing Editor

e role of the NCAA bas-
ketball official is to main-
tain order, not to control.

The role of the NCAA basket-
ball oﬁicial is to let the players
play the game. It’s the players
who make college basketball the
great sport that it is.

The role of the NCAA basket-
ball official is to remain unbiased
throughout the game and call
fouls both ways, which means
that if J eny McCullough gets
called for slap fouls, then Edgar
Padilla of UMass should get
called for slap fouls, if necessary.

A trio of NCAA basketball
oﬂicials, head referee Tim
Higgins plus Jody Silvester and
Gene Monje, appeared to violate
all of these rules in last r1ight’s 79-
71 Panther loss to UMass.

From the onset of the game, the
oﬁicials did their best to make
sure the Minutemen would
remain the only undefeated team
in Division 1, despite the appear-
ance that the PittPanthers out-
played them, outhustled them and
was the only team on the court
that wanted to win.

Something must have triggered
those refs, something must have
made them really mad. It’s a good
possibility that whichever IDIOT ,
threw a Panther pom-pom, doing
his best impersonation of the
knucklehead NY Giants fans,
onto the court two minutes into
the game ignited the refs’ anger.
Way to go jerk, hope you’re
proud.

After that, things began to
snowball.

After UMass was whistled for
two fouls in the ﬁrst 56 seconds
of the game, Pitt “out-foul ”
Umass 12-5 the rest of the ﬁrst
half. Pitt was called for seven
reach-in fouls during the half.

Sitting in press row, I get a
good view of the game. It was not
difficult to see UMass commit
these same infractions, including
several thrown elbows that went
unnoticed. .

The worst call may have come
against center Mark Blount ._
Blount was driving for a lay-up,
and well after leaving the air a
UMass defender settled under
 In the rulebooks, this is not a
charge. To last night’s officiating
crew, it was.

Well, maybe that wasn’t the
worst. At the begrnmn' ° of the -

. -Column, page 8 ‘

As Andre Alridge released the
shot with less than a second left
in regulation, 6,798 frenzied
Fitzgerald Field House fans
inched closer to the court, ready
to make a mad rush towards the
ﬂoor.

But Alridge’s shot, which
would have broken a 66-66 tie,
had a little too much umph, thus
putting a hold on Pitt’s major
upset bid against the No.1 and
undefeated University of
Massachusetts Minutemen.

In overtime, though, UMass
fed off Pitt’s missed opportunities
and outscored the Panthers 13-5
in the extra frame, as the
Minutemen won their 17th con-
secutive game, 79-71, last night
at the Field House.

“When you get a chance to
beat the No.1 team and miss
some opportunities down the
stretch, it’s tough,” point guard
Jerry McCullough said. .“I
thought wehadit. The.last cou-
ple of possessions, they got the
breaks.”

Although UMass was a nine-

point favorite, Pitt appeared to
have the upper hand. Marcus
Carnby, UMass’ 6-foot-ll linch-
pin in the middle, was dressed
but didn’t play. Pitt, which has
never hosted a No. 1 team at the
Field House", had the place
packed and jacked. Plus, the
Panthers have been 645 versus
non-conference opponents at
Fitzgerald since Pitt joined the
Big East in 1982.

McCullough, who finished
with a team-high 20 points and a
career-high 11 rebounds, opened
up the ﬁve-minute overtime with
a layup in traffic. But UMass
proceeded to go on a 10-0 run,
thanks to four straight Donta
Bright free throws and consecu-
tive 3-pointers by Carmelo
Travieso. Travieso, who scored a
game-high 27 points, killed Pitt
all game from the 3-point are.
His seven of 14 3-point shooting
performance was punctuated
with a trey so deep in the corner
that he almost fell into the
UMass bench and subsequently
ended any Pitt hopes of a come-
back. His shot put the
Minutemen up 76-68 with 1:14
left

" ' .. _ While the NHL held its annual All-Star game in Boston, the Pitt
H  ' S hockey team. presented some All—Star performances in Pittsburgh.
. V ‘ ' The Pitt hockey team scored 18 goals in two games as it defeated
A ' 7 ' Robert Morris 11-0 and Slippery Rock 7-3, improving Pitt’s overall
Yo U R B R N record to6—2 and its division record to 5-1.
— . Brad Rizzo, Bill Elliott and Pat Kenny were Pitt's All-Stars this
’ weekend. Rizzo got a hat trick in each game as he tallied four goals

  ' per game. Elliott had five goals and four assists Friday against
. O Q ' Robert Monis, totaling nine points, his most in a game. Goalie Pat
. Kenny posted his first shut-out of the season against Robert Morris.
" - " Even with all this scoring, there was still a moment when Pitt had
1:] to hold its breath. '
. [E It was the first period against Slippery Rock. Goalie Jeff Haduch
was looking impressive as he held Slippery Rock to no goals.
_ . Haduch awaited his next shot. Slippery Rock’s Bob Sechevits took
I a slapshot from just inside the blue line. The shot hit Haduch on the
T 0 u R N A M E N T side of his helmet and knocked him unconscious.
I “It was a scary, solemn moment,” said Dick Rizzo, the team’s

said.

Haduch was given smelling
salts, and Coach Rizzo said that
the first thing he asked when he
came to was, “Did it go in?”
Coach Rizzo’s response was
“no,” because, amazingly
enough, Haduch made the save.

As he was being carried off
the ice, Elliott said Haduch was
insisting he could still play.
Haduch stayed dressed and on
the bench to serve as a back-up
to Kenny, who went in for him.

Before Haduch was knocked
out, Pitt had a 3-0 lead on goals
by Rizzo, Dan Gynn and Ryan
Moore. Rizzo opened up the
scoring 1:22 into the game, giv-
ing Pitt a 1-0 lead. Rizzo added
his second goal of the contest
55 seconds later. Four seconds
after Rizzo made it a 2-0 hock-
ey game, Moore scored.

The scoring didn't stop there.

A brief two-and-a-half min-
utes later, Gynn scored to give
Pitt a 4-0 lead. Slippery Rock
finally got on the board as
Folkenroth slipped one passed
Kenny at 6:30 to get Slippery
Rock back into the game.

Before it was all said and
done, Rizzo scored his third
goal of the period with 4:55 left
in the period to get his second
hat trick of the weekend. .

White said Rizzo had just
moved up to a forward position.
The move seemed to beneﬁt the
team, as Rizzo proved he was a
definite scoring machine.

“I’m jealous,” White said,
laughing. “I want to be on that
line.”

With 5:55 left in the second,
Slippery Rock tallied another
goal to get back into the game,
making it a 5-2 hockey game
with a period yet to play.
Slippery Rock’s comeback was
stiﬂed by Rizzo as he scored his
fourth goal 14 seconds later and
gave Pitt a 6-2 lead.

Pitt's Travis Wills scored 2:29
into the game to put the game
out of reach. Slippery Rock
scored a minute later to answer
Wills’ goal but never recovered
from the goal deﬁcit it was in.

“We got the ﬁrst goal quick-
ly,” White said. “That’s tough
when someone comes out and
scores on you.”

It seemed scoring early goals
was the trend of the weekend.
Friday’s game against Robert
Morris was the same story: Pitt
came out scoring and never let
up.
Bill Elliott opened up the
scoring 1:08 into the game.
Rizzo scored 2:54 seconds into
the game giving Pitt a 2-0 lead.
Two minutes later, Elliott scored
again. Then, after two minutes,
Elliott scored to get the hat
trick. The onslaught continued
as Pitt took a 6-0 lead at the end
of the first period.

“If it wasn’t for everybody,
we would have never won,”
Elliott said. “No one’s being
selfish. We’re just having a lot
of fun together.”

remaining.

But as hot as the Minutemen
were in overtime, they were
equally as frigid in the ﬁrst half.

Pitt jumped out to 5-0 lead on
Chad Varga’s (17 points) 3-
pointer in the corner. It took
UMass nearly three minutes to
score, as Pitt’s harassing defense,
coupled with the deafening
screams of the Fanatics, had the
Minutemen discombobulated.

At the 13-minute mark, the .

Panthers expanded their lead to
15-3 when Varga dove for a
loose ball and pitched it to
Gerald Jordan for a layup. At
that point, the Field House was
rocking as hard as it ever had,
forcing UMass to call a timeout.
After the timeout, UMass went
on a quick 9-2 run to slice Pitt’s
lead to 17-12.

But with 1:27 left in the half,
Pitt showed its resiliency, as it
opened up a 12-point lead when
Varga threw down a two-handed
mojo. As UMass did all night, it
responded with seven—straight
points to close out the half, and
Pitt went into the intermission
leading 35-30.

“The crowd did a great job.
They stayed in it the whole
game?’ said Jordan, who scored
12 points and grabbed 11 boards.
“That encouraged us to go out
and stay in the game and play
har .”

Slowly and methodically
UMass chiseled away at Pitt’s
lead in the second frame, and at
the 15:05 mark, Bright (26
points) netted a turnaround

jumper to give the Minutemen '

their ﬁrst tie at 40. Four minutes
later, a pair of Bright free throws
gave UMass its ﬁrst lead, 47-45.
After exchanging baskets, Bright

game, Chad Varga shot a jumper
from the top of the key, but the
ball didn’t make it within ﬁve feet
of the rim because his elbow was
practically shoved up his nose
after being hit by a UMass
defender. Alas, there was no
whistle. .

Pitt owned the Minutemen in
the ﬁrst half— completely. A 15-
point halftime lead should have
been a reality, but the refs
trimmed the lead to ﬁve.

Maybe the refs would have
learned their lessons when the Pitt
Police had to escort them back
onto the ﬂoor for the second half.

That was not the case, as the
refs continued to call emphatic
fouls on the Panthers, almost
taunting the crowd with the calls.
Silvester called a blocking foul on
Garrick Thomas and ran two
thirds of the court gesturing the
foul.

In overtime, McCullough went
to the middle and was knocked
down by three Minutemen.
Travelling was called, and ,
UMass sealed the game.

The refs showed up the players
in this one.

Stevens set a record, despite the

“It was a personal high score

Stevens said, “but I’m working

Stevens plans to work her

And with 1:14 left, Alridge

fouled. Alridge hit both free

shots at breaking the tie but
failed on all of them.
