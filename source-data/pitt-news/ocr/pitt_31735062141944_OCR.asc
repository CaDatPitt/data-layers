Resolutions for iiiiniediate recogni-
tion of Soviet Russia, for the calling
of a. \Vorld ’l‘aril‘t' Commission to scale
down barriers of international trade,
and for cancellation of all inter-allied
iwar debts were adopted in the plenary
session of the Intercollegiate Confer-
ence on World Problems held in the
Faculty rooms of the Hotel Schenley
‘Sunday morning.

The first two resolutions received
unanimous approval, but debt cancel-
lation, bitterly contested, was passed
by only a narrow 23 to 22 vote. The
conference delegates, in voting‘ for
the proposals, did so “as American
‘college students," and not “diplomats"
of the nations which they represented
in the concl-ave.

\Vhilc representing world powers
meeting in conference, the delegates
agreed: “W’e accept the Lytton re-
port as it has been given to the
League, of _Na.tions, and urge its ac-
ceptance by all nations.” ,

Under the responsibility of national
representation, the delegates varied
their stand on the war debt problem,
declaring: “We favor a ﬁve-year
moratorium on all inter-allied war
debts, during which period a. funding
commission of world powers will re-
view the problem, looking toward re-
vision and ultimate cancellation of the

debts.

Ninety-two delegates, from fourteen
schools in the tri-state district, at-
tended the conference, which was

By JACK BUNKER
There is, on the horizon, a possible
cure for the present economic trou-
bles of the world and a tonic that
might ‘insure us recovery from the
‘ most severe business slump‘ the world
' has ever known, says Mr, Fred Kury,
' ﬁnancial editor of the Pittsburgh
Press.
‘ This "tonic, that Mr. Kury sees as a
' potential remedy for the aching busi-
' ness oflthis down-in-the-mouth world,
is in the settlement of war debts.
' War debts is the vital question that
is now occupying the bald-headed
‘ row in the International Events Fol-
lies, and over which our genial friends
across the Atlantic are vocalizing so
, much in their respective chambers
and‘-parliaments.‘
“Recovery,” in the opinion of Mr.
Kury, “depends on whether the Euro-

..,.

pean debtors of the United States can
reach an amicable agreement with us
on the settlement, one way or an-

_ settlement is not soon forthcoming, I

gloom.”

“T__he great diﬂiculty Europe faces,”
Mr. Kury says, “is- not so much in
meeting the ﬁxed periodical payments
on the loans, but in trying to pay the

' tremendous amount of interest due on
the periodical installments. -' If we

Sugar As Building Material

 

Is Subject of Research Done

tute Fellow; Malzes Stronger lvlortar

 

The farmers down in the sugar belt
certainly are raising cane these days.
In fact, they’re raising more cane
than ever since it has been discov-

ered that sugar makes good building
material. If anything at all can help
the Southern gentlemen in the way of
farm relief, ca.ne is able.

Doctors have prescribed sugar for
growdng children, but this is the first
time -we ever heard engineers pre-
scribe it for growing buildings. From
Mr, Gerald J. Cox, senior industrial
fellow at the Mellon Institute of Re-
search, who is speaking tonight at a
convention of the Sand-Lime Brick
Association in Detroit on “Use of
Sugar in Sand-Lime Brick,” we learn
-that the addition of sugar to liydratecl
lime makes a sub-stance——calcium
monosaccharate by name——which is
much more active than ordinary
slightly soluble lime. This, in turn,
makes mortar which is stronger than
ordinary mortar, with no loss in
workability on in adhesion to brick.
If the results of Mr. Cox’ experiments
be shown practical, sugar will be

building than to l)ootlegge1's for fer-
menting.

The sugar brick (not the lump-
s11ga1~ you buy at the grocery store)
is taliing a niche along with the ice-;
cream brick and the wine brick.‘
Rough trials using thirteen pounds of
sugar to every thousand pounds of
other material have shown increases
in both transverse and bompressive
strengtli, and other sugar substances
as glucose and molasses have shown
corresponding increases. With that
in mind, we won’t be a bit surprised
next month to see some fellow with
a “hankering after sweets” chewin.’-I
on a hunk of the new Presbyterian
Hospital. or taking a. bite out of a
pillar of the new Mellon Institute
Building.

So, with the information that sugar
may be used for construction pur-
poses within the near future, the
plantation owners are in high hopes
that the cane sugar industry will
make a comeback; that is, if the con-
struction industry ever comes back.
Their only fear is that the sugar-beet
growers in the VVest may “try to beet

if at all, can the ﬁve day week de-
crease operating costs, spread jobs, or
increase spending power; is 3, store
justified in spending money on store
parties as a means of promoting good
fellowship and maintaining morale?”

Mr. Montague, in his discussion of
Technocracy, is expected to talk about
several of the following problems:
“Suppose that- Howard Scott be-
comes the business autocrat of the na-
ti.on—wou1d the technocrats require
him to carry out such undertaking as
these: Provide jobs for everyone; ,
put energy certiﬁcates in place of
money in the pay envelope; require
people to spend all their income and
not save for a rainy day; make a 50
per cent cut, or larger, in working
time; raise standards of living to new
heights?”

Dr. A. P. James Speaks
At Historical Society

Dr. Alfred P. James, professor of
history, was the speaker at the meet-
ing of the VVestern=Historical Society
at the Society building on Bigelow
boi1l.eva.1'd last Tuesday evening. Dr.
James’ subject was “Opportunities for
Research in the Early History of’

of the early realization of the import-
ance of this region, stressing the fact
of the large amount of material and
data to be collected.

Examination Schedule

First Semester 1932-1933

The following is the general arrangement of hours for the first
semester examinations which will be held from Monday, January 30,
to Friday, February 3, inclusive. The examinations of the two-hour
Saturday Classes (those designated in the schedule by the abbrevia-
tion "‘St.”) will be held during the regular class period on Saturday,
January 28.

for what she must buy instead of!
amassing her money for debt-pay-'
ments, the Press ﬁnancial editor sug-
gests, “Solution of the whole problem,
lies in either cancelling the interest‘
charges on the debts or in amortiza-
tion. When we realize that the inter-

during the period since the war, we
should we willing to allow her at
least amortization of the interest
charges. As an application of this
,theory', I think *the interest amounts
{should be amortized over a 50-year
‘period.” ‘
Mr. Kury believes that business in
this country, despite international
questions, has the best chance for re-
covery, even though it is a slow re-
covery, during the year 1933 than in
any other year since the economic,
slump began, To support this con-1
clusion he cites the general returning
conﬁdence in industry, and the
gradual dissipation of pessimism.
After the ‘obstacles ‘immediately in
- front-of recovery. are settled,. Mr.
Kury sees ahead of the country a,
cycle of good business and economic-

ever known. due to the inﬂuence of’

the depression in bursting false econ-
omic bubbles.

As further aids to recovery, Mr.
Kury points out the better under-
standing between employer and em-
ploye noticeable lately in industry,

reforms. When the year ended, too,
Senator Norris was sponsoring a bill
in Congress to make compulsory a SIX-

ers.

So, taking everything into consid-
eration, Mr, Kury feels, as do most of
the‘nation’s business men, that the
last three years are but now a had

dream, and that “the worst is over."

The grades for the Saturday (“St.") classes are due Tuesday,

Strauss Claims Discounts of
$1,100 to Date

 Vv'ith the announcement that the
:Cooperative Buying Association has
saved its members close to $1100 in
discounts during the last three
months, seven fraternities that hith-
erto were not closely aillliated pledged
[their wholehearted support for 1033.
{December yielded the least-refunds,
labout. $125, because of the holiday va-
4 cation.
l According to Sam Strauss, business

manager of the Association, the re-
gcently Iestablished menu exchange is
,more t ian living up to expectations.
‘;'l‘he exchange, which was innovated
lin an attempt to vary house menus,
 operates on a reciprocity basis. Each

§Ea’dy Discusses Solution
For Economic Problems

“You university and college stu-
dents who are safe and comfortable
do not yet realize the situation in
which the United States ﬁnds itself.
America is the last trench of the old
‘laissez faire’ capitalism, and condi-
tions are going to get worse until
some thing is done about it.” This
was the warning Dr. Sherwood Eddy
extended to Pitt students in his ad-
dress, “The VVay Out —— A Personal
Problem,” at the First U. P. church
last Thursday evening. The lecturer,
in the second of his series of talks to
iiniversity students. answered the
question raised in his noon discussion.
“The Student Faces a New VVorld,"
which was given at Heinz House.

Panther Cagers

Unbeaten Skibos Face
Test at Tartan Gym;
Tech Seeks Fourth Win

An undefeated Tartan basketball team, with accident insurance
available, risks its record against a slightly bruised Panther in the
Tech gym tomorrow night in the ﬁrst meeting of the two teams this
season.

The game will have a bearing on both the city title and the
standing in the Eastern Intercollegiate League, with the Tartans
seeking their fourth victory.

The Skibo's, under the leadership’

of Coach Max Hannum, have made an
impressive showing in their cage    
Tw o I n E a s t

games this season, and have register-
Yale, Harvard Score Lopsided

 

ed victories over VVest Virginia, Tem-
ple, and VV. & J. The Panther’s rec-
ord is not quite so impressive, being
dotted with two defeats. but showing
victories over Purdue, Butler, Mimic-
sota, Georegtown, and Temple.

The usual Pitt—’l‘ecl1 battle will like-,
iy be unfolded to a highly appreciative
audience, meaning that the battle is
likely to go to either team. A parade
of cripples on both sides may see
action tomorrow night, with Carlson
likely to produce Cribbs at center,

Victories Over Panthers

 

From all indications, a new word
will have to be added to the English
language to describe the defeat of the
Pitt swimming team by both Yale and

. . H-a1""1r .
and Max Hannum producing Red Sil-,_ ‘"1, d_ . _
vel-n1an from 3 hospital cot H0“.--3 Pitts fourteen meet winning streak
ever, this drastic action will not be was sharply snapped on Friday

forthcoming unless absolutely neces-
sary.

~’.l‘he same Pitt lineup that dropped
a thriller to the Dukes will likely
start tomorrow's game: Ochsenhirt at
center; McCamant and Charley
Hughes at guard; Captain Don Smith
and Wainio or Skip Hughes at for-
ward. Carnegie Tech will likely start
Stentz at center; Smith and Jagnow
at forward; Fergus and Silverman or
Siegal at guard.

Carnegie has not defeated Pitt in
basketball since Charley Hyatt was
a sophomore, but have come close to
doing so on many occasions. Tomor-
row night’s battle seems to be in
favor of the Panthers, but will likely
not be decided until the ﬁnal minutes
of play.

Although this is Max Hannum’s
ﬁrst year as Tech cage mentor, the
former oﬂicial has surprised local
fans by taking what appeared to be
a. mediocre squad and rounding it into
a team that seems headed for the
heights. For the ﬁrst time in many
seasons the Skibos will have capable
reserves to call upon it the necessity
arises, Coach Hannum has groomed
Carlson, Petransky, and Edelblut, for
the forward posts; Mihm, Seigal, and
Riggs as guards; Biers and Ewalt as
centers.

Carlson can hardly boast such an
array of reserves this season, and if
the battle makes much substitution
necessary, Pitt will likely be tried and
found Wanting.

night by a powerful Eli team, 57-18.
Yale took ﬁrst place in every event,
and most of the second places to run

up the score. The Yale second team
won the relay race from the Panther
splashers to add insult to apparent in-
jury. It was Yale’s one hundred
nineteenth consecutive victory.

A score that differed only slightly
from the Friday night meet was reg-
istered on Saturday when the Harvard
swimmers defeated Coach Corr’s
splashers, 52-23. Better results were
obtained by Pitt in this meet, with
Carik gaining the only ﬁrst place
won by the Panthers. Paul Stinner’s
second in the ﬁfty-yard free-style, and
Joe ., Schmieler’s second in ., the 200-

A ﬁghting Panther basketball team, _

rival as 4,000 fans jammed the sta-
dium pavilion on Friday night, The?
occasion was the Pitt-Duquesne has-l

the short end of a. 26-25 score. It
marked the second Duke victory over
Pitt in as many games.

Except for a one-point lead at the
start of the game, the Panthers never

ten points behind at the half, the
score being 17-7. Slim Wainio, Carl-
son’s newest ﬂoor sensation once
again startled the crowd by beginning
an orgy of field goals that nearly
broke up the ball game.

The te11 point margin at half time
proved too much for the Panthers to
overcome, and the Dukes fought out

a last minute rally to win the game.

The inter-class Speed Swim spon-
sored by WAA last Monday proved to
be a comparatively easy victory for
the juniors, their scores being 32,
with 18 for the freshmen, 14 for the
seniors, and 11 for the sophomores.

The winning junior team including
Jane McNamara, Isabelle Murphy,
Kate Clark, Dorothy Forner, Helen

places, with Jane McNamara, the
highest individual scorer, ﬁnishing
ﬁrst in the forty-yard crawl in twenty-
ﬁve seconds, and with Isabelle Mur-

seven seconds, as well as in the
eighty-yard free style in one minute
and nine seconds. The juniors tied
the freshmen for participation points.
The junior mermaids placed second
four times with Dorothy Forner and
Fannie Hirsch in the twenty-yard
cross chest carry and in the twenty-
yard tired swimmers relay; Helen
Roe and Dorothy Forner placed second
in the eighty-yard candle relay, and
Kate Clark in the forty-yard crawl.

The Speed Swim, the second in a.
series of swimming meets was the
second victory for the junior women.

HUMIDOR PACK ~

One of Houdini’s most spectacular escape feats
was performed with a huge milk can filled with
water. He invited persons of the audience to bring
padlocks and lock him into the can. He got into the
can, the lid Was put on and fastened with several
padlocks. A screen was placed in front of the can.
Assistants stood by with stop Watches and fire axes
to save him from drowning after a certain time.
About a minute later, the screen was removed,
Houdini was seen panting and dripping . . .thc
padlocks remaining intact!

EXPLANATION:

The usual method of escaping from a milk can is
:1sfoIIoWs:Tl1e lid of the can is apparently secure-
ly padlocked to the lower portion, but actually the
metal band to which the staples are attached is the
top of a short inner lining. The performer, after
Ireingrlocked into the can, pushes the -lid upward
with his head and the short inner lining is forced
out of place, permitting his escape. The screen is
then removed.

VVhat exciting magic there is in cigarette
advertising!

Let’s look at one of its greatest illusions
...that cigarettes can be mysteriously given
superior "FLAVOR." .

me EXPLANATION: Just three factors con-
trol the ﬂavor of a cigarette.The addition of
artiﬁcial ﬂavoring...the blending of various
tobaccos...and the quality of the tobaccos
themselves. Quality is the most impor-
tant. Artiﬁcial ﬂavoring can never wholly
disguise the poor ﬂavor of cheap tobaccos.

The blending of several cheap, raw to-
baccos cannot improve the ﬂavor of any
of them. A ﬁne cigarette is a cigarette
blended from costly, ripe tobaccos.

If is en fact, well known by leaf to-
bacco experts, that Camels are
made from ﬁner, MORE EXPENSIVE
fobaccos than any other popular brand.

This is why the Camel ﬂavor has never
been rivaled . . . Why Camels have given
more pleasure to more people than any

In more costly tobaccos lies the secret of
Camels’ delicate “bouquet”...of their rich,
cool ﬂavor—-of their non-irritating mildness.

It’s the tobacco that counts.

Smoking Rooms Needed

have heard the suggestion voiced

by students that the University provide smoking rooms for men
and women 111 the more frequented buildings on the campus.

'l‘hc
particularly to Alumni Hall, in

which most classes with mixed enrollments are scheduled.
Even undergraduates, certainly not the most sensitive souls in

the worl.d by reputation, decry the

failure to provide smoking rooms

for its unpleasaiit appearances rather than for its actual inconveni-

(‘l'1C€.

\Vomcn students who smoke at home, in restaurants, and at

dances and other social gatlieriiigs must seek the seclusion of parked
automobiles along University drive if they care to smoke any time
between classes. The vast majority of men who use tobacco gather
about building entrances, causing congestion, and always leave be-
hind a litter of unﬁnished paper and tobacco leaf.

We can no longer fool ourselves into hoping to ﬁnd the solution
to the problem by saying, “VVomen at Pitt don ’t smoke” or by mak-
ing any other similarly naive statement when confronted by the
issue. WOIIICII at Pitt do smoke; not all of them, of course, but more

than enough to justify caring for

their needs. We do not believe

that providing a suitable place for such “activity” necessarily would
be encouraging the indulgence. Nor do we believe that by failing to
provide the facilities we can correct personal habits already formed

——if correction is the ﬁnal aim.

Smaller and less widely copied institutions than the University
have seen ﬁt to recognize such a need as this, and have promptly

gone ahead in providing for it.

Several organizations, it is reported, have made tentative ap-
peals that the space be providcd, where most needed, for both men
and women. \Ve should like to see these appeals given the active sup-
port of organizations interested in student welfare. Certainly only
the actual physical limitations of campus classroom space should
prevent the carrying out of the project. And even these have been
known to give way to the adjustments of necessity.

Library Receives 121 Books
During Month Of December

 

In addition of 121 books to the Uni-I
versity Libraries was made during?
December, 1932. according to a list of I
new books made public.

Among them were seven biograph-
ies, including ones on Napoleon, Em-
ily Dickinson, and John Quincy
Adams.

Business and commerce books to-
tal 27. They include works on adver-
tising, management of stores, rail-
ways, psychology of selling, and prob-
lems of the executive. Only two
chemistry books are included.

Thirteen books on economies are
among the collection. These include
a. volume by the Business Research
Council, “A New Deal’ by Stuart
Chase, a volume by G. H. D. Coole, “Ec-
onomic Tendencies in the United

States” by F. C, Mills, and George-'

Sou1e’s “Planned Society."

There are eight books on education
in the list. Among these are Charles
Beard's “Charter for the Social Sci-
ence in the Schools,” a. symposium

on the university in a. changing world‘,

and a report of the Purdue Student
committee on education.

Three books comprise the ﬁnance ,
section:

There are eight history and travel
Works. They include Remy de Gour-
mont’g “Pendant L’Orage" and C. G.
Shaw’s “Trends of Civilization and
Culture.”

Thirteen volumes compose the lit-
erature list. R. C. Bencli1ey’s “No
Poems; or Around the World Back-
wards and Sideways” and Oscar
Wilde's “De Profundis" are among
-them. Seven books make up the
physical education and‘ sports list.

There are only two political science
works and twelve psychology vol-
umes. Walter-;B_ Pitkin’s “Life Be-
gins at Forty" and C. E. %eas‘liore’s
“Elementary Psychology” are two of
these. There are three general ref-
erence books.

Four volumes of ﬁction include
works by Henry Bordeaux, John Gals-
worthy, C. B. Nordhoff, and O. E. Rol-
vaag. Twelve miscellaneous volumes
complete the additions.

The present Buy American cani-
paign being so avidly supported by,

sidered in the light of the experience
which Great Britain had with 3. simi-
lar holy cause year before last. Part-
ly as an excuse for and partly as a
prerequisite to a. protective tariff
policy that Conservative politicians
wanted, “Buy British” became a
household phrase.

All the ballylioo that Englislimen
would swallow (and a good deal that
they refused) was spread thickly over
the island from the chalk cliffs of
Dover in the south to the Shetland
Islands north of Scotland. News-
papers printed Buy British editorials.
;The Prince of VVa1es declared that the
eating of British oysters was the Do-
lite and patriotic thing‘ to do. The
London skies were lighted at night by
electric signs which ﬂashed Buy Brit-
ish. In doing her Christmas shop-
ping, Queen Mary refused to buy for-
eign articles. And every time a Free
Trade liberal rose to speak in the
House of Commons, he frotlied at the
mouth.

Here's How it Failed!

The only failure of the Consei'va_-
tives, insofar as publicity was con-
cerned, occurred when the Archbishop
of Canterbury refused to admit a. Buy
British chant as part of the Anglican
ritual.

The only failure of the Buy British
campaign, insofar as economic effects
were concerned, was that it was :1.
their protective tariff bill
buying foreign goods, keeping a.
thought for their pocket-books rather
than for patriotic sentiments.

Widespread Endorsement

I11 the United States the liigh-tariff
psychosis has affected a larger por-
tion of the population than it has in
the‘ British Isles. Even farmers, who
are the, traditional“free-traders of the
nation, have in recent years been in-
duced to believe that a tariff on agri-
cultural staples would raise the prices
of those articles. And the liigh-ta.riff
frenzy of the industrial east is notori-
ous, The Buy American campaign is
getting popular endorsement. That
cannot be denied. But that it will
get popular action is doubtful. Presi-
dent-elect Roosevelt and his fellow
Democrats promised lower tariffs dur-I
ing the campaign; and there is no in-
dication of a change of heart among
them. As for any spontaneous action
from the buying public, that is a vain
dream.

Particularly damning is the most
conspicuous source of the Buy Ameri-
can sentiment. That very section of
the public press which advocates it
daily made holy war against the Re-
publicaii high-tariff policy during the
last campaign. And particularly of-
fensive, to me at least, is the depic-
tion of the foreign laborer as a
bearded demon in smock and sabots

The Howl Over Technocracy

A more healthy sign of economic
thinking and a sure indication of. the
power of clever publicity is the coast-'
to-coast howl raised for and against
'l‘echnocracy. Mr. Howard Scott was
given the use of a radio network last
Friday evening. Scott made a good,
many predictions, and most of them’
were gloomy. He hinted at, but he
did not predict deﬁnitely, a dictator-

AS early as last July Mt, Stuart
Chase expressed hopes of such a gov-
Gl‘l’lI_I1e11_IZ by eiiginee1's. Not long after,
Mr. Chase received an answer from
a. graduate of the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Teclniology. The MIT
graduate didn’t think much of the
idea. In the light-of the proposals of
the Technocrats that we turn society
over to the engineers, and let them
run it on a “scientiﬁc basis,” the
answer is interesting. It reads, in
part, as follows:

“Certain facts about the ‘college
years’ of the engineer may help us
understand his peculiar unﬁtiiess to
lead an experiment requiring social-
niindedness . . . The best of the tech-
iiical schools give but a smattering of
history and economics Proper
education, no doubt., could show the
engineer how to mobilize his technical
skill in evaluating and solving present
social and economic problems. But
for the present I believe that leader-
ship by American engineers would be
no different from that by the mining
engineer now in office.”

The Argument Against it

Until the tecnnocrats propose to
abolish Mic-,k'ey Mouse ﬁlms, I shall
consider the above -statement by an
engineer the best argument against
Teclinocracy extant. There is no
denying that the huge existing debted-
ness of industry is stupid and anti-
social, that existing systems of cur-
rency are undependable methods of
evaluation, that rapid technological
changes are bringing about zi new in-
dustrial revolution. VVe are grateful
to the technocrats for throwiiig the
spot-liglit on these facts. But in their
ﬁrm determination to be absolutely
original and different, the teclinocrats
booted down the stairs the very peo-
ple wlio have always been wise to
Technocracy under a different name.

By this act and by their stressing
of increasing production (neglecting
{the important subjects of d'istribut1on,
.aiid...co11suinption), they ‘have given:
themselves dead away. It ought to
be apparent by now that the techno-
crats care little about social prob-
lems. Like good teclinicians, they are
interested in techniques. That is
commendable. But like good techni-
cians, they ought to run along and let
the socially minded take care of the
social problems,

If we are to have a dictatorship, let
us have one by college graduates who
have majored in economics, history,
and political science. As I have ob-
served these creatures, they have the
mental and emotional equipment for
such a job. ‘ I

History Offers Consolation

The teclinocrats hre enjoying them-
selves throwing scares into the pub-
lic. They make predictions of the
awful unemployment, the continued
depression that we are about to wit-
ness in the coming years. So far as
I can see, they are positively right
I expect to witness
every disaster that they foretell. It is
only with the most unfounded optim-
ism that I avoid suicide, For there
is always the pleasant memory of
David Ricardo and Thomas Maltlius,
two gloomy, pessimistic‘ economists,
who frightened the English of their
day so that M,udie’s Lib1"ary could not
supply the public with enough novels
of medieval romance. Neither Ricardo
nor Malthus had a contemporary who
could refute’ his arguments. The
world sat and waited for the catastro-

ship of the technicians.

and Maltlius were wrong.

In 32 A. D., Seutlies & Son, Alexan-
drian mercliaiits, lost some spice
ships in the Red Sea. Too, the Ethio-
pian caravan trade slumped‘.

Then, Malchus &. Co., dye makers
at Tyre and Antioch, became insolvent
after a manager appropriated some of
the funds. Dr. \Vatkins says that was
the Ki-euger case of 33 A. D. Follow-
ing this, the Romans began a run on
a. bank of Maximus & Vibo, who had
lent heavily to the Tyre dye makers.
and the panic began in earnest. Other
banks in Rome soon lost the~.conﬁ-
dence of their investors and many of
them closed shop; the official govern-
ment newspaper printed stories of
other business failures at Corinth;
creditors pressed debtors for payment,
and insolvency followed insolvency.

When conditions called for drastic
action, Emporor Tiberius acted by
lending 100,0-00,000 sesterces of public
money to relieve the banks. This Dr.
Watkins compared to the “Reeon-
struction Finance Corporation.” Soon
the panicky feeling subsided, the peo-
ple had a return of conﬁdence when
news of good business came in from
other big cities, and? the Panic of 33 A.
D. became just a Roman memory. ‘

Dr. Watkins showed the conven-
tioneers how that depression of long
ago compared with the present one.
There was freezing of foreign loans,
falling of prices, rumors, bank fail-
ures, bank runs, commercial failures,
panicky unloading of goods, and gov-
ernment relief.

George Raft on the Warner screen
this week is every bit of 9. stool-pigeon
or, as the title has it, an “Under-

sympathy, nevertheless, as he sets
about tracking down the killers of his
father and Nancy C-a1'i‘oll’s brother.
He and Nancy unite and succeed in
exposing the ﬁends. Although the
story has -a familiar ring, it really
manages to be interesting due to the
powerful perforinance of Mr. Raft and
the clever bit of acting by Miss Car-

‘ ‘The Brothers Karamazov’ ’—
Cinema
The understanding of the German
language is unnecessary to enjoy
Dostoyevsky’s powerful drama “The

Brothers Karamazov,” the current
Avenue Cinema attraction. Very lit-
tle dialogue is used in the famous

story of two lovers, their happiness
and struggle. Fritz Kortner, Ger-
nia.ny’s most famous dramatic actor,
an Anna Sten, the latest foreign
talent to reach Hollywood, enact the
parts of the lovers in a most sincere
and moving fashion. Their performi-
ances are two of the best that ever
reached‘ the tiny Cinema.

good actress, no doubt, but somehow
she falls to move the audience as the
inagdalen who is sent to her death by
her own son (Donald Cook). The son,
of course, is unaware of this fact.-
She even kills her friend (Louis
Calliern) who threatens to reveal her
identity. Miss Chatterton, you may
recall, did similar parts in “Sarah and
Son” and “lVIada.me X,” but there she
constantly had the audience in tear-
drenclied eyes. Here, on the other
hand, outside of a few thunderous
scenes devoted to the conception of
the 1906 San Francisco earthquake,
the picture fails to entertain.
