Shockley Lists Tentative
Summer Term Activities

By PAUL E. PFISCI-INER

Extension of student activities’

into the summer semester may
stimulate new programs this year,
Dr. Frank Shockley, director of the
summer semester, said today.

He said that students themselves
should make up their summer pro-
gram, for “it is the students? pro-
ject and the program will be what
they make of it." _

‘Several activities already have
laid tentative plans and made lists
of members who expect to enroll
for the summer semester.

Several offices of the deans of“

men and women, from which stu-
dent activities are controlled, dis-
closed that a ﬁnal program for the
summer cannot be ready until
June, pending ﬁnancial arrange-
ments and an estimate of student
enrollment.

Possibilities of an intramural
sports program including tennis,
golf, swimming, archery, track, and
mushball were mentioned. ,

The department of military sci-
ence will conduct ROTC drills this
summer in connection with its
ROTC program. This suggests the
possibility that the Band will be
needed. Robert L. Arthur, assist-
ant dean of men and director of

the Pitt Band, already has hinted
that the concert band will play
concerts this summer.

Dr. Shockley has asked Theo-
dore Finney, head of the music de-
partment, to submit a. program
from the music department. Dr.
Shockley suggested band “pop”
concerts and choral programs.

In former summer sessions iced
tea has been served in the Com-
mons Room in the morning. Mrs.
J. K. Miller, hostess of the Univer-
sity, said that iced tea will have
to be abandoned this summer due
to the lack of sugar, but some sub-
stitute will. be served. .

The Speech department and dra-
matic clubs could work up page-
ants and\ plays to present on the
lawn of the Cathedral or in the
Foster memorial, the summer sem-

‘ ester director said.

Pitt News probably will publish
twice each week during the sum-
mer, according to Robert X. Gra-
ham, adviser to student publica-
tions. A
The Owl staff, campus yearbook,

has announced that it will work
during the summer and will issue
a publication in January. The Pan-
ther refused to comment on its
summer plans.

Men Smarter'n Vvomen,

, So Finds Art

College men are 25 per cent bet-
ter informed on current events than
college women, it was discovered
by Arthur Thompson, C43.

‘Thompson conducted a survey

in conjunction with one of his so-
ciology courses, spent several af-
ternoons questioning University
studerits. I-Ie attempted to cover all

branches of the school, and his‘

questions were directed to students
in all divisions, as well‘ as Pitt
News workers, the “Tuck Shop
crowd,” and members of other
University -activities.

In addition to the fact that the
men were better equipped to an-
swer the questions, of which there
were 21—all cur-rent or related to

the present war, Thompson found .

that college students as a whole
are poorly informed and in some
cases do not even read the news-
papers, and that members of the
Pitt News stalf are slightly supe-
rior to the average.

“Off hand one would assume
that since men and women are
about equal in l.Q., there would be
a similar equality in current event
knowledge,” Thompson declared,
“But the factor that causes the dif-

String7Sinfonietto Plays

In Foster Memorial
The Women’s String Sinfonietta

- of thle University will present -a

music program at Stephen Foster
memorial this evening at 8:30
o'clock.
The Sinfonietta is under the di-
rection of Miss Gwen Treasure.
Material from the Foster Hall
collection will be on display.
Although the public is cordially
invited, tickets of admission are
required. The tickets may be ob-
__tained_without charge from the of-
ﬁce of the Stephen Foster memori-
al, Mrs. J. K. Miller, hostess in the

mons room, the Information

 

ference is interest.” ’

Women, he believes, are not as
vitally interested in the war as
are men.

Of the 50 students questioned,
only two received as high as 90
per cent. The only question that
was answered correctly by all was
that one dealing with baseball.

A few of the erroneous answers
were: —
(1) It is 350 miles across the

Straits of Dover.

(2) The Japanese captured the
Burma Road two weeks ago.

(3) It is 300 miles from Dakar
to the Weslt Indies.

(4) The U.S. Navy successfully
attacked and defeated the Japanese
on the Aleutian Islands.

(5) The Industrial Revolution
occurred in Russia at the time of
Peter-‘the Great.

Among the reasons Thompson
was given for“ the lack of knowl-
edge were lack of interest", and
scarcity of time to read the news-
papers.

Heralded by Clifton Fadiman as

one of the outstanding ‘contempo-
rary novels, Gladys Schmitt’s
“Gates To Aulis,” will emerge
March 27 from the Dial Press. Miss
Schmitt, who according to Fadi-
man is second only to Thomas
Mann as a writer, graduated from
the University of Pittsburgh in
1936. ,

Whit Burnett “discovered” Miss
Schmitt in I940, took an immedi-
ate interest in her after he had
read about 20 pages of the manu-

She was awarded the $1,000 Dial
Press award for the best manu-
script of the year, last fall and re-
ceived $25O for pin-money if she
would endeavor to write one novel
a year.

As much will be spent'in the
first month following its release to
advertise’ “Gates to Aulis” as was
spent on Pierre, van Paasen’s

Twelve thousand copies will be

victors in the First World War. Instead of welcomi-
ing the chastened Germans as’ full , partners in _a
new world order, they did much to emphasize the
German feeling of national inferiority and insecur-
ity. ' l
They helped to discredit the moderate and liberal
German leaders who were, willing to cooperate.
They failed to live up to their own promises and
pretenses. They added to German economic difficul-
ties, which in turn undermined the security of the
middle class and the workers; In the end their own

as to maintain standards of living brought on a world

debts we exacerbated the economic confusion of the
world and the reparation problem inparticular.

The play is a contemporary, cur-

rent-events conscious musical. The
.kids_ satirize everything» from the
Andrews sisters to Mothers’ day,
from Mrs. Roosevelt to Hitler.
They are completely unself-con-
scious as they synthesize all the
warblings of the famous girls trio
into one grand musical mess called
“Slap Me Brother With a Pie-a-la
model”

They needed a clincher for their
Mother’s day skit——someone had
told them after one of the perform-
ances that their satire had lacked
punch. That same night the cast
got together and turned out a tune
that ends “So don’t shoot maw on

But it’s the intense‘ drive of the
group itself that‘ puts the play
across ‘even more than its timeli-.
ness or its cleverness or its youth-
ful frankness and sincerity. The

box oﬂice manager is ‘one of the
kids whose entrance isn’t until the
second act. The ushers are mem-
bers of the chorus--and anyone
who comes in after Act I, Scene
Two, has to ﬁnd his own seat.

Stars of the revue are a couple
of 20 year old kids named Phil
and Betty. Phil is a gawky, almost

Pitt’s old post office room in
Thaw hall has become a center for
the training of metallurgists for
war industries. Since the room°was
acquired a year agofor this pur-
pose, equipment has been added
bit by bit until today it is a com-
plete metallurgical inspection lab-
oratory.

Morning and evening classes “are
, cenductedto prepare men for work
in the army and navy ordhance di-
visionsﬁand to instruct workers al-
ready employed in industry’ in the
latest methods. Special classes. are
'maintained for men who work in
shifts. * ' "

l The metallurgical, laboratory’s
equipment includes many delicate

-instruments. One ofthese is a ‘heat-
. treating, -furnace.
temperature is automatically. con-‘

The .furnace’s

trolled, and " temperatures up to
2,500 degrees Fahrenheit can be
produced. \

By the use of this furnace, stu-
dents learn how to harden steel.

Play 'N,ative Son’
Returns to Nixon

Returning to -Pittsburgh for its
third and ﬁnal week, “Native Son”
presented by the director wonder
of the stage and »screen, Orson
Welles, will present the same cast
‘headed by Canada Lee that was
seen at the Nixon in the two pre-
vious engagements. A ‘

 The opening, this evening, at the
Nixonin Pittsburgh will be the
ﬁrst‘ performance of the second
year for “Native Son.”. -

.i_Canada Lee, the ex-jockey, ex-
ﬁghter,‘ ex-band leader, has been
acclaimed by the leading dramatic
critics" of the country as the best

Negro dramatic actor to appear on _
the American stage. His portrayal

of the : sullen, rebellious, Negro
youth who is mystiﬁed at the harsh-
ness of the treatment accorded Ne-
groes and who accidentally smoth-

ers thevbeautiful white daughter of A

his" employer and then makes an
effort to conceal the crime by burn-
ing herbody in the Dalton furnace
is’ one of the classic characteriza-
tions of the nioderln America-n
theatre. '

to let the audience know that

The idea of these kids and their

the little dance studio where we
saw the play and rented a full-size

thousands of kids like them are
staging their own revues, minia-

someone’s told Hollywood about it.

First, a regulator is set for the de-

is set from 1400 to 1600 degrees
Fahrenheit , depending upon the

nret-al’s carbon content. The steel
is then heated and, after it has

become hot enough, it is cooled by,

quenching in oil or water.
. The steel then is tested for hard-
ness, tensile strength, impact and

fatigue. The micro-structures of the

steel are also investigated in. con-

You can credit the weather with
a big assist in getting the Panther
baseballers in condition for the
coming season. After the heavy
downpour of last Monday that
ﬂooded out baseball practice, the
sun came out, dried things up, and
enabled the Mitterlingmen to get

, in a week of practice on stadium

soil. .
The ideal weather conditions
prompted the coach to remark that
this was the first time he had ever
taken a team out when/there was
no frost on the ground. Last year
Mitterlingibarely got the boys out
a week before the opening game,
a game, incidentally," that had to
be canceled because of snow.

The outdoor sessions enabled the

Wearn to get some much needed bat-

S

King practice, and on Thursday Mit-
terling staged the ﬁrst intra-squad
game, a four inning affair.

The only position that seems set
is ﬁrst base. Johnny Brown, the
sole regular tocome out from last
year’s squad, is expected to again
take over the initial base. Many of
the players arecoming out for the

Phi Delti Mermen

Phi Delta Theta’s swimming
squad continued their merry unde-
ifeated way last Thursday afternoon

Liwhen they trounced a title-con-
tending Phi Ep team, 34-5.

The Phi Delts are sporting an
unbeaten mark of 7 straight vic-
tories thus far this season, and are
virtually in as far as the IF trophy
goes.

The Pi Kappa Alpha mermen are
safely lodged in second place with

,6 wins and a lone defeat. while Phi

as
7

Epsilon Pi, Phi Gamma Delta, and
Delta Tau Delta are tied for the
third spot.
I The independent swimmers will
meet Wednesday at 5 o’clock,';the
J"ratei-nity trials on Thursday, the
Engineering meet on Friday, and
ﬁnally the all—campus swim meet
the following week.

Last year the GDI squad ended

the fraternity domination by plac-
ing more men in the ﬁnals than did

the Greeks, but this year, led by
E the Phi Delts, the frat men will be
i rather hard to overpower.

first time and competition for the
other positions is wide open.

Those who have reported for
inﬁeld duty in addition to Brown
are Bill Kostenbauder, Davey Wil-
liams, Bill Fisher,_ Fred Wilner,

‘Jack Vollbrecht, Milt Tall, and

George Jacobs.

The outﬁelders worked out for
the ﬁrst time on Tuesday. Aldo
Icardi has deserted the catching
ranks to try out for the outﬁeld
and James McCullough, a ﬁrst
baseman, is also working out with
the outﬁelders. A list of outﬁelders
would show the names of DeLong,
Fieldstein, Kopetas, Silverman, and
Crum.

Coach Mitterling seems satisﬁed
with the progress of the team, and
somewhat cryptically announced
that they “look just about the way
you would expect a team to look
whose opening game is not until
the 13th of April.”

This year the team is scheduled
to play thirteen games. As yet no
decision has been reached as to
whether the season will be extend-
ed. .

Tentative Meet
At Cleveland

With the arrival of spring, Pitt’s
‘indoor track season will close next
Saturday afternoon at the Greater
Cleveland Invitational meet. Most
of the entrants in the meet are from
the numerous small Ohio colleges
and, as yet, the meet is tentative.

Once again the Blue and Gold

entry will feature the mile relay
quartet of Peretic, Smith, Carter,
and Stickel. Carter, the Panther’s
Negro flash, will once again take
care of the 45-yard dash and the
-broad jump, while Harold “Hap”
Stickel will also be in on the 45-
yard dash and the 45-yard low
hurdles.

Other Panther hopefuls in the
meet will be “Dusty” Rhoades and
Maurice “Red” Jessup, both of
whom will take part in the pole
vault competition.

The indoor ﬁnale will be run off
at the Jungle Ca“ts’ track house,
right after the Cleveland meet,
when the annual Pitt champion-
ships will be held. ln this meet the
Panther cindermen vie with each
other for the University indoor
track records. V

immediately following the close
of the indoor season track mentor
Carl Olson will begin training his
squad for the coming outdoor
meets.

Punting, Blocking Features
Football Practice Drills

With the weather ﬁnally giving
Pitt’s ‘football team a break, Coach
Charlie Bowser sent his entire out-
fit through a brisk drill last Friday
afternoon. The squad was broken
up into small groups and were put
through their paces by Bowser’s
aides. '

lnstead of shivering in the cold
and trying to keep warm, as was
the case earlier in the week, the
players were able to cut loose and
get the full benefit of the session.

Freshman mentor-Nick Kliskey

had the kickers under his wing, and .

before the drill was-over, long
spiral punts ﬂooded the air over
the practice ﬁeld. The rest of tthe
backs concentrated on a spinner
play under the watchful eye of
Forrest Evashevski.

In another corner of the field
Ted Konetsky had a group of line-
men working and put them through
a series of blocking and line-open-
ing drills. Johnny Dickinson had the
ends working hard to master a fast
get-away.

At this stage of spring practice
the team is shaping up fairly well,

Students interviewed were not
given a choice of several answers,
but gave their own, and the per-
centage answering with such vari-
ations as “for the continuance of
democracy,” “for freedom and lib-
erty,” “for the Bill of Rights,"
amounted to 40 ‘per cent. Next
largest group, 18 per cent, declar-

. ed we are ﬁghting the war pri-
marily to defeat the axis powers.
The answers, in general cate-

gories were:

Reasons given the interviewers
were varied. One girl at Stephens
college. in Missouri said “To save
our own neck; that’s why.” Another
answer was: “We are ﬁghting to
finish what should have been done
in the last war.” -

It is to be noted that four per
cent of those interviewed believe
that we are ﬁghting En=gland’s war.
"A similar attitude was thatrwe are
ﬁghting because of the Pearl Har-
lior attack, being forced into it.

Many gave economic gains as
the reason for the war, pointing
out Japan's need for the raw mate-
rials in the Dutch East Indies and
the Unitedlstates’ determination to
preserve them. I

Another Record Broken .

Breaking the sales record for
the fourth time, the Defense Stamp
committee sold the Military ball

high in Wednesday stamp sales.

Lieutenant Donald Campbell and
Cadet-Colonel James Dimel, C42,
acting_ on behalf of. the military de-
partment, purchased the stamps,
which will be distributed as favors
at the ball tonight.

Theta Phi Alpha women’s
stamp sales totaled $228.50.
Bond sales fell to $93.55 to give a
total for the day of $322.25.

Chairman Herbert Gall, M43, de-
scribed the day as “successful, since
it is our object to sell stamps pri-
marily.”

Best saleswoman of the cam-
paign, Eleanor Epping, BA43, sold
204 stamps, almost three times the
former individual record, as she
set: a new single sales record of
103 stamps. ,

Most consistent saleswoman is

The Military ball committee's pur-
chase, while not attributed to the
TPA’s, was negotiated Wednesday
and consequently raises the cam-
paign’; total sales to $2,379.25.

Local Business
Shows Increase

Pittsburg-h’s business index rose
last week from 139.8 per cent of the
1923-25 total average to 144.1, the
University Bureau of Business Re-
search reports. The index was 145.6
in the final week of Februaryand
140.4 at mid-March last year.

District steel industries operated
at 95-97 Per cent of capacity last
week, the rate being reduced
slightly from late February. Blast
furnace operation was numerically
unchanged but the bituminous coal
Production and electric power out-
put advanced decidedly. High
water, slowed‘ the usual seasonal
increase in river traffic.

Although still exceedingly small,
new motor registration was the
highest in seven weeks; local street
and railway buses carried more
passengers then they did in any
other week this year.
