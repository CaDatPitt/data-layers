Teachers polled who voiced
some objections to the evaluation
were Dr. Richard C. Tobias, asso-
ciate professor of English, Dr. Nor-
man Levine, associate professor of
mathematics, and Mrs. Harriet
McCarthy, assistant instructor of
mathematics.

Approval Given. _

Expressing approval ' for the
plan were Dr. Robert Colodny, as-

Miss Carolyn La Rue, instructor of
English. .
‘ Tobias said that the plan,-

versity of Colorado, where he

taught before coming to ‘the

university, showed some unne-

‘ cessary brutality at times, when
extremely adverse opinions.

were given about teachers and

then published. _ _ 
Getting to the technical diffi-
culties of the program, Tobias ex-
in the fact
that the program was being car-

_ ried out only in the School of Lib-
-yr-eral Arts, and not in other de-

partments of the university.
Cites Potential
‘However, he was quick to add
that the program did have poten-
.tialities if the resultswould be
made known only to the faculty
during the ﬁrst few years of its
existence. Explaining this, he said,
that after the novelty of the idea
had _worn off, the students would
be able to present a more un-
bia'sed opinion. .

Orientation For

‘New ,Me1nbers

occupies sci Senate Meeting

By HARRIET
At the Monday meeting of

A. WEHNER
the Senate, all new members

‘were oriented by Woody Turner, Arts ’61.

Three qualities that Turner felt were essential for an
eﬁicient functioning Senate were: thinki‘ng,Aaw.areness, and

responsibility. _
He said that a

of any problems incurred by theO
student body, and to be’ able to
make sound judgement as to the
means by which these" problems
can be corrected.’
More Efficiency Expected
Turner also said thatvsince the
Senate will no longer be held back
by’ administrative details, .more
efficiency should result in the
functioning of its committees.
Turner added “that in writing
the constitution, we tried to pre-
vent the type /of program in
which people fail to cooperate
withthe government because of
petty personal problems.” ‘

Senator’s responsibility is to be aware

‘ Turner continued by saying that
what you write or invision in a
constitution seldom comes into re-
ality. . He then quoted Benjamin
Franklin——“Do what seems to be
best at the time.” _

Other Issues Liscussed
A brief discussion fcllowed con-
cerning the course evaluation, the
student-book exchange, and the
new judicial system in order to

Tap Day, Engineers’ Week Conflict

\

Representatives Discuss Solutions

By RONALD BURFORD

Representatives of two major
imiversity events, Tap ‘Day and
Engineers’ Week, met Monday to
iron out a schedule conflict, but.
were unable to reach an immed-
iate agreement. a

Tap Day is scheduled for noon
March 16, while one of the events
of Engineers’ Week is slated for

4 the same time.

Presenting the views of the Tap
Day committee were Donna
Shrader and Woody Turner. They
pointed out that Tay Day can't
be any earlier or later than its
now scheduled date March 16 be-
cause of the agreements that have
been already made. Some of the
organizations that are involved,

'14-

   

‘ neers’  Week,‘ Robert Sheehan,

‘ are governed by unchangeable na-

tional rules.
The representatives of Engi-

Tom Auten and Dan Yates, re-
ported that their position is al-
most equally as binding.

_The only date open for them
is also March 16. The Monday
of Engineers’ Week will be used
for tours and on Thursday and
Friday, because they will be un-
able to get the radio personal-
ity that they need to conduct
the gimmick that they have
scheduled. -

‘The only hour that is suitable
for ibothievents is noon. This is
because they will not be allowed
to take time off from classes.

If it were not university policy
to not schedule activities ‘at noon
on Tuesdays because of the serv-
ices in Heinz Chapel, the schedule
conflict might be resolved.

Tap Day is the time when the
student honorary organizations
announce their new members.

‘Special’ awards, such as Sopho-

   

more Man of the Year, Mr. -and
Miss Pitt, and ODK Man of the
Year, are also presented.

« Engineers’ Week is an entire

.week devoted to the engineers,

during which time projects are
displayed, a‘ dance is held, and
two days of classes are dismissed.

Two Movies Set

Two movies, “M” and “The Red
Balloon,”.will be presented by the
Student Union Assemblies Depart-
ment on Monday at 3:15 p.m. and

pass holders only, because of
contract committments. However,

, John Scott, special assist-
ant to Time publisher, ames,
Linen, will appear as guest
speaker at the.Midday Pro-

- gram next Monday. At 3 p.m.

he will speak at an informal
coffee hour‘ in the main lounge of

the SU.

Scott, a_ Russian expert with
vast ﬁrsthand experience .in global
reporting, returned from a four
month study-tour of the Soviet

,,empire. Now a foreign correspon-

de_nt,‘author, and lecturer, he ﬁled
his ﬁrst dispatches for Time from
Japan in 1941. l
The next year he became Con-

tributing Editor of the magazine
in New Yorl<.‘I-lis coverage of the’
State Department in‘.Washington,
assignments in, London, and direc-
tion of the Time—Life bureau fol-
lowed. Scott reopened Ttme’s Cen-
tral European bureau in Berlin‘ at
the end of the war, and returned
to the New York office three
years later.

Sent on his first global as-
signment in the summer of 1952,
he has made fact-ﬁnding trips
to Germany, Austria, Greece,
Turkey, Italy, Morocco, France
and England.

In each of the past seven years _

he has travelled extensively
through Europe and the Middle
East, Latin America, Southeast
Asia, Africa, and the Soviet
Union. '

Born in Philadelphia, Scott re-
ceived his education in schools"
in the U.S. and Switzerland. He
attended the University of Wis-
consin for two years after grad-
uating from George School, Penn-
sylvania. ‘ ' «

Early in the period of the De-
pression, Scott decided to leave
college, seethe world and write.
Within the nextfew months, he
earned a welder’s certiﬁcate
from the General Electric train-
ing school in Schenectady, New
York and sailed for Russia.

There he mastered the language
by working for ﬁve years in in-
dustrial plants. The great purge
of 1937 forced him to leave Soviet
industry. An account of his life
in the Siberian steel mills and
chemical plants is presented in
Scott’s ﬁrst book, “Beyond the
Urals.’’ , .

Publication of “Duel for Eur-
ope.” “Europe in Revolution,”
and “Political Warfare,” follow-
ed shortly. Scott's most recent‘
work, “Democracy Is Not
Enough,” was published at the
end of the last year.

Remaining in Moscow for three
years, Scott became correspondent
for “Havas,”- the French news

‘agency, and later for the London

Award in Med
School Contest

The research paper of Edward
M. Tapper, a junior -in the school
of medicine, received top honors
in competition against others sub-

, mitted by students of the univer-

He also received a $25 cash award.

In his research, Tapper found
that cortisone will protect rabbits

 In less than two months, the.win'ter trimester will be
v  At that time approximately 1,500 seniors. will grad-
..uate. ‘A A ‘ . . ’_
A However, these seniors, along with candidates for mas-
ﬁters or doctor of philosophy degrees who have completed
their required work, will not receive their diplomas and
 clﬂicially depart from the university until June 8, nearly two
- -‘imonths later.

’l‘“l1i,s delay between concluding work on the number of
credits necessary for a particular degree and being granted
a diploma exists because of this reason: . .

‘While the concluding date of the second unit of the aca-

’- demic year was moved ahead to April 14 because of the

mencement has remained the same.

Whereas in past years commencement followed the last
day of the semester by only a few days, there now exists
 gap of almost two months. *
~. We can think of no reason for retaining June 8 as th
; date for commencement, except that it was done for tradi-
.’t:ion’s sake. But why keep this particular tradition when so
 others have been thrown out in the past several
iymrs? , 9’ 4
 A couple of years; ago, the mid-year ceremonies was
eliminated, leaving only the June ceremonies tocover all
 graduates. This probably was an accepted move due to
fﬂle low number of January graduates and the expense in-
fcllrred by that commencement. A A

 of money into the forthcoming June ceremonies only

5to discover on that Wednesday morning there will be an

unusually low percentage of_ graduates present to receive’
_ “their diplomas in person; i

V By June 8, many students will have started to work or-
. f will have left the city for vacation or for their homes.

_ Some persons mayltake the day off if they are working.‘
But who will interrupt a vacation or spend the extra train

5 hours worth of commencement? Not too many, it seems
.. likely. ..

V The solutionhfor commencement this ’year« would have
been to hold it as soon after April 14 as possible.

  After which trimester to hold commencement in the
fixture may be a problem. But scheduling it after any one
of the  s would be more feasible than the tradi-
 June date.

A Tribute to Tuck Shop Squatters-..  
, By Jim Vaughan

Hail, -Tuck Shop, silent Eden of sweet air and

sunshine; generous provider of the sustenance of

our bodies, we raise our‘ paper cups and salute thee.
We rejoice in thine name, goodly Tuck Shop,

or  

implementation of the trimester system, the date for com— ,

We believe, though, that the university will put a large .

for plane fare to come here from home just to sit at a few '

   

for thou art the -last remaining

refuge from.the modern evils of “

TV, electric lights, and running
water —- a -haven whence man
can retire for‘ a moment of

‘ peaceful contemplation.

Matrix of all wisdom, scarred
battleground of academicians of
past and present, noble Tuck

‘ 4 Shop we. praise thee. Thou in-

stillest in all who enter thee a

fire of diligence and fortitude

and individuality that courses

through" the veins and grips the very soul within.

In thine many-boo_thed bosom the chosen can
ﬁnd a place whither they can gather unto them-
selves to ponder the mysteries of the universe and

chart the destiny of man.

‘Let the Cathedral of Learning and all its sub-
sidiary buildings ring out thine name, glorious
Tuck Shop; at once, thou are the symbol of hope,
enemy of despair, champion of the dignity of man,
companion in times of stress and hardship, and
model for brother1y_ and sisterly love. Vital heart

of Pitt, throb on.

of mayonnaise and a sopping, brown,’ teaybalg, he
set down his cup of coffee and planted his elbows
on the scarred, unvarnished picnic table before

him.

A ﬁnger" slowly ran along his check as if to
erase the scar. With a frown he quickly folded his
arms, slouched down in the booth, and glanced at
the girl sitting next to him.\..S_he was reading page
nine in a book on logotherapeutic existentialism.

He turned his head away from her and looked
about the poorly lit place. The room’s depressive,
cream walls and the dirty cement walls on the
other side of the windows made him feel as if he
were in’ a_prison.‘ And the row of -booths before
him, on his side of the aisle, resembled corrals.,

The aisles, he thought, in contrast to the narrow
booths, were .nice and wide. ‘They ought to be
easily wide enough for the garbage trucks to drive

.up to the "booths each (night.

Geise Lauds AAUP’s
Protest of A ffidavit

Editor,‘ the Pitt News:

The University was happy to
receive a resolution of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Chapterof
the American Association of
University Professors condemn-
ing the disclaimer affidavit re-
quirement of the National De-

fense Education Act and com— .
mending the Administration for‘

proteestfmg against it.

The resolution is timely, for
there is now before the Senate
of the United States a bill, intro-
duced by Senators Clark and
Kennedy, for the repeal of th
requirement. A '

The attention of the sponsors
of the bill and of other members

of the Congress will be called to

the resolution as representing
the considered view of faculty
leaders and supporting the Uni-

Concerning ‘Decision

Editor, the Pitt News:
According to the Pitt News of
Feb. 17, the local chapter of the
AAUP has directed a sharp re-
solution at the “loyalty oath”
provision of' the National De-
fense Education Act, and I feel
that it is high time that at least
‘one voice is raised in opposntion
to this point of view.

‘ He grew bored and tried to‘drink his coﬁee,
but couldn’t‘stand it. Setting it backdown in the
mayonnaise, he glanced at the girl beside him. She

was reading the ninth page in a book on logothera-
peutic existentialism. '

. He wondered, at- the sight ofiher eager, ex-

pectant smile, how many hours it would take her

booth.

to get her daily allotment of acceptance at her \

Frorrrthe surrounding booths there came semi-
human sounds. At one booth, there was a band of
Tuck Shop Squatters rocking back and forth on _,
their tails and their mouths were wide open withi‘~<-**‘
laughter as they clapped their hands in appre- _ '
ciation of one another. At another booth be over-
heard one fellow dramatically telling two -A wide-
eyed buddies about a G.I. hero in the late, late’
show who spat in the eye of his captor.

He shut his ears to all the noise. It seemed
that all the Tuck Shop Squatters he saw were
stirring ice with their straws, or ﬁngering their
cups, or folding and refolding‘ litt1e'\scraps of
paper while taking glances, at their books» ..

He watched. them raising their cups to their 
'mouths with quick, jerking motions, and“ wondered Vs,
how calm they were. «

He resolved to get a coke the next time. When

he got up to leave he glanced at the _girl beside
- him. She was reading a book on logotherapeutic

discriminates, since farmers and
businessmen are not obliged to
attest to their loyalty.

‘The principal reason for this ..

difference is that a real dearth
of subversive activity is to be
found ‘among our farmers and
small businessmen, and the pos-
sibility of -a loan going to one
who is a communist is so remote
that it may be overlooked.

On the other hand, there is

good reason to believe that com-
munist students might apply for
loans. ‘
- Hence, the “discrimination” is
actually recognition of a de facto
situation and is justifiable. (If
any remedial legislation is in-
dicated, it would be extending
the oath to cover the other cata-
gories.)

The second reason advanced
by the AAUP what that the pro-
vision “simply was not effec-
tive,” but this is not the case. It
is well known that offenders are
often convicted on counts other
than the most serious of those
brought against them, e.g., I‘Il§.E§,
Beck, etc.

It is reasonable to believe that
a conviction for perjury might
be obtained where a Smith Act
conviction could not. Thus, in
terms of utility, the clause can
again be jlustiﬁed.

The final reason, and “lTlOF=;1l
important in Rosenbcrg’s opin-
ion, was that it“ was a funda-
mental infringement upon a per-
sonsright to think.”

It is good to know that this is
the “most important” reason, for

statement of loyalty to the gov-
ernment, which not only _ pro-
vides for. our protection, but is
nowr also producing funds, for
our education, is an infringement
upon freedom of thought?

I think not! If a‘ person is to.
,be educated at the expense: of

.a government, _is it not respons-
ible to require that heqnot be an
adherent to philosophies which

would overthrow that govern-

ment by violent means? Again
the reply seems clear.

I, for one, will be happy to ,

sign a disclaimer affidavit on
any occasion, and I ﬁrmly be-
lieve that most American stu-
dents, save‘ those few “bleeding-
hearts” of the Left, will cheer-
fully join me, the obitor dicta
of the AAUP to the contrary
notwithstanding.

Invited to Write
House Council

Twp university educators have
been invited by President Eisen-
hower to attend the President’s
Conference on Occupational Safe-
ty, to be held in Washington, ‘D.
C._, March 1-3.

The men invited are Walter R.

Turkes, associate dean of the uni-
versity’s School .of Engineering
and Mines, and -Harry W. Wol-
farth, associate professor of in-
dustrial engineering.
V Professor Turkes, who attended
the last three conferences, said.
“As always,‘ we are vitally in-
terested in safety at the univer-
sity. .

“And as an engineering school
we can do much to make our
students aware of good safety
practices and to help them elim-

inate hazards ‘from equipment
and working environment.”

The purpose of the conference,

l

lenge of Safety in a Changing
World,” is to devise and then ap-
ply voluntary, cooperative means
for reducing the 13,300 deaths and

juries. hoccuring annually because
of on-the-job accidents.-

Under the chairmanship of Sec-
retary of Labor James P. Mitchell,
the Washington meeting will en-
deavor to solve the‘ problem of
minimizing thebcountry’s losses in‘
manpower, in technical skill, hu-
man suffering, and ﬁnancial waste
that job accidents are causing.

The program, held every two
years, will be geared to safety
and health problems arising
from rapid technologicaland so-
cial change and will emphasize
broad topics pointed toward the
coming decade. ' '

Professor Turkes -is also director

professor of industrial
engineering and head of the de— '
partmen-t at the university.

This is the second safety con-
ference attended by Professor
Wolfarth. At the university he is

stated thatthe poll served “no
useful purpose.” He also added
that students trying for certain
teachers and classes would raise
havoc at registration.

Mrs. McCarthy said that it
would “make no difference if the
results of the poll were made pub-
lie, for teachers try their best re-
gardless of what the students say."

Not For Individual Thinkers
She said that the booklet would
be of deﬁnite value to those stu-
dents who rely on the opinions of
others, but would be of little use
to others.

In summing up she stated, “I
can’_t think of any useful pur-
pose it has except to give the
students something to do!”

Dr. Colodny’s opinion was a
deﬁnite contrast to this, as he said
that it'would be “quite useful, if

Colodny stated, “This practice has
been going on. at Harvard for
many years and it -hasn’t hurt any-
one.”

Finally, Miss LaRue. stated
that she was deﬁnitely in favor
of it. She said, “I think students
have always evaluated the in-
structors, whether it was in the
Tuck Shop, fraternity and so-
rority -houses, or in the Student
union. They show their opinions
by trying to get in certain class-
es, and out of certain others.

“I have tremendous faith in the
student body,” she went on. “They
are honest and" sincere, and since
they pay a high tuition, they have
a right to demand excellent in-
struction.” ’

“TheItelle|ohio,n,e cornpany really
helps you grow with your job",

. John T. Bell majored in History and Eco-A
nomics at the University of Georgia‘. On '

graduating in June, 1957, he joined the
Southern Bell Telephone Company.

Today—less than three years later—he' .
is a Public Qﬂice Manager for the'com-'
’ pany at Orlando, Florida. His office serves

50,000 telephone accounts and handles

more than a million dollars’ worth of

revenue every month.

John says: ,“I chose a telephone career
over a number of others because I was
impressed by the company’s Management
Training Program and the opportunities
offered for rapid advancement. It was the
best decision I ever" made.” . ' '

John got his initial training’ at Jackson-
ville and Daytona Beach, where rotational
assignments familiarized him with over-
all company operations. Then he trans-
ferred to Orlando, where he trained as a

business oliice representative, attended an
insti'uctor’s school, and then taught classes
himself for several months.

Dealing with people—his “first love”-
is J ohn’s main job as Public Oflice Manag-
er. Besides handling personnel and other
administrative duties in his office, he
makes many customer contacts in and out
of the ollice. “I’m kept busy giving talks
about the company at meetings of busi-
ness and civic groups,” he says. “Also,

I work closely with leading citizens on
various civic projects. It’s mighty satis- ‘

fying, and I feel it’s making a better man-
ager of me. The telephone company really
helps you grow with your job.”

Why not look into career opportunities
for you in the Bell Telephone Companies?

See the Bell interviewer when he visits . ‘

your campus—and read the Bell Telephone
booklet ﬁled in your Placement Oﬂice.

freshman. Christine, who is from
Indiana,’ that ‘ town we talked
about last week," likes to read
Freud. and his dream interpreta-
tions, besides the Pitt News.

She has done everything from
being a goalie in ﬁeld hockey to
plinking empty beer cans in a

Besides skiing on water and

around the golf course and also
has a_ wicked tennis backhand.
Her specialty is riding English
racing bicycles, although she en-
joys just plain walking.

Along the aesthetic side, she
dabbles in abstract painting and
portraits and designs some of her
own clothes. Her favorite is a long

red velvet evening gown. She also
taught herself to play the piano
and organ in three months. Along
with her creative endeavors, she
would just as soon sit down and
take a watch apart to see what
makes it tick. '

Freshman representative on the
liberal arts cabinet is our _Newsie,

ture French poodles. One thing
the girls of Kappa Kappa Gamma,
in which Christine is pledging, are
sure to ﬁnd out if that she has
a strange taste for baby food, par-
ticularly apple sauce—and french
fried onion rings.

State is ranked third in the country while the Panthers

hold the number ten spot. But.

“They will be ourroughest op-

will be tough right down the line.
They have good men in the light
weights and good men in the
heavyweights. Their only weak,
spot will be in the 130 pound

concluded, “If things go right and

Sophomores Do Job

Panthers can be contributed to a
number __of things. _

For one, three sophomores
have come through tremendous-
ly. Martin, Kelivington and Zoli-
koff have all gone through the
first eight dual meets without
getting beat. These three boys
all have a good chance of _win-
ning the Eastern title in their
respective classes and must win
Saturday if the Panthers are to
upset State.

" The second reason for the Cats

ment of Len Vuocolo, Tom Hall
and Bob Guzik. Vuocolo and
Guzik have come up with key
wins ' that have enabled . the
Panthers to have a 7-1 record but
it has been Hall who has been a
consistent winner this year. _
Hall has a 5-1 record with his
only lost coming in the heavy-
weight division where he spotted
his man 40 pounds in weight. Last
year Hall had to wrestle in the

their home season Saturday
n most basketball experts an-
asons for optimism. First, the

‘Panthers are at home, they are playing Penn State and what
could prove to be most important, Co-Captains John Mills
and Bill Mauro are ﬁnishing out their college careers before

’ hometown followers. (See pictu:e¢
 on. right).
“7 Last time out against. State at

University Park, the Cats drop-
ped a 75-64 decision. Surprising
‘fenough the,'reason for the defeat
'was not the play of All-American
candidate Mark Dumars, but a
6-3 sophomore from Pittsburgh,
Gene Harris.

“Harris wrecked us in our
last meeting,” commented Tim-
mons. “We will watch him a little
\. closer this time.” John Fridley,

the Cats’ best defensive ace, will
' guard Harris.

_ Mauro A Leader

Against State, Mills played one
of his best games. He garnered 22
points, high in the game, and
pulled down 16 rebounds. “Before
this season Mills was never much
of. an offensive threat. But this
year through work he has devel-
oped himself into the teams lead-
ing scorer,” Timmons said. .

Mauro unlike other players on
‘the team came out to play de-
- spite the lack of scholarship.

“Mauro has done a ﬁne job all

season,” commented the Cat’s
. mentor. “He has a working

knowledge of the game that has
made him a smart leader.”

“Neither of these boys had a lot
of ability,” said Timmons, “but
worked at it. They have to be
given a lot of the credit for our
success.” Mills has averaged bet-
ter than 14 points a game while
Mauro has been hitting for an

So if Mills and Mauro take it to
mind to play a good_ closing game
at home, and if‘ these co-captains
get a little help from Fridley;
Falenski and Sankey, the Pan-
thers will make ‘it, at least, a

The Panther baseballers have
started spring practice for the
forthcoming season. No, they aren’t
down in Florida. And they haven’t
crossed the country, to the sunny

to venture out Arizona way you
wouldn’t ﬁnd the Panthers prac-

team, basketball team, wrestling
and gymnasts teams, the squash
team and some wandering foot-

are holding their daily workouts.
If you are wondering if there
is enough room in the Field House
to accommodate all of these ath-

Coach Warren Neiger’s Panther gymnasts will conclude
their "1960 [dual meet schedule on Saturday when they jour-
neyto University Park to encounter Penn State. The Jungle
Cats face the task of defeating last year’s Eastern’ and Na-

,\

tional champions. 

The Blue and Gold will take a 5-2 record into the battle

with the Lions. Lead ‘by Co—cap—
tains Dave Hirst and Don Kasner,
the Panthers have whipped
Springﬁeld, West Virginia, Syra-
cuse, Temple, and Georgia Tech
while- losing to Army and Navy.

Penn State, meanwhile, has
compiled a 4-1 mark this season.
As the result of a 54%;,-411/2 set-
back suffered at Army two weeks
ago,’ it appears‘ as ‘ though the
Lions must relinquish the 1960

“They’ll probably be a little too

be favored to win providing .that
they hit, but we have a pretty
good chance to take them in

announced Neiger .after yester-
day’s practice. session.

The highlight’ of the meet will
be the dual on the ﬂying rings
between the Panthers’ Hirst and
the Lions’ Co-Captain, Jay Wer-
ner. Hirst is-undefeated in‘ the
seven meets to date and needs a
win over his long-time_friend
from Philadelphia to go unde_-
feated in dual competition for
the second consecutive season. '

Hirst defeated Werner for three

straight years to win the Phila-
