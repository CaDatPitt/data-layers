SGB president returns to meeting
S after recovering from illness

Megan Trimble
Staff W riter

Student Government Board Presi-
dentjames Landreneau welcomed
students back to Public Meeting
Tuesday night after his temporary
sick leave.

Landreneau, who recovered
from mononucleosis and neutro-
penia — a white blood cell deﬁ-
ciency --—. reported that Oct. 28
will be the ﬁrst town hall meeting
to be publicly held on campus. It
will take place at 7 p.m. in Suther-
land Lobby.

“There will be free pizza and
an SGB activity, but hopefully, it
will help to foster more commu-

 

nication with people on campus,”
he said to the roughly 30 people at
the meeting at Nordy’s Place in the
William Pitt Union. Holding town
hall meetings was one of Landre—

. neau’s Board initiatives when he

ran for president last year.

The Board — responsible for
distributing funds from the more
than $2 million Student Activities
Fund —— transitioned to discuss-
ing issues concerning student ac-
cess to programs on and off cam-
pus, as Board reports addressed
the issues of Panther Funds, the
Collegiate Readership Program
and “I Heart Pitt Day.”

Board member Alex Murdoch

reminded the audience of the
Panther Funds initiative, which
was a focus in his platform during
the previous SGB election. Mur-
doch said the University will be
requiring all businesses who offer
Panther Funds to have high-speed
internet connections in order to
operate the Panther Funds pro-
gram more efﬁciently. Students
can load Panther Fundsionto their

student IDs to use as an alterna— '

tive form of cash at participating
businesses in Oakland.

tems previously prevented stu-
dents from purchasing items with

  Students "power
down to save energy

Parthena Moisiadis
Staﬁ‘ Wrz'tar

With the incentive of.a cash prize,
students will race to lower the ther-
mostats and turn off the lights in
their residence halls. '

The Panther Power Down,

Showdown is a competition be-
tween certain residence halls to see
which hall can reduce its energy
use the most for the month of Octo-
ber. The event, spearheaded by the
Oakland Green Team of Engineers
«for a Sustainable World, will ofﬁ—
cially begin Oct. 1 and end Oct. 29.

Inthe past, ESW has completed
projects that have led to plastic bag
reduction at the campus conve-
nience stores and more water bot-
tle reﬁll stations around campus.

Jon Bechtel, the project’s lead-
er, said the Panther Power Down
Showdown is the group’s ﬁrst,proj—
ect that will rely solely on student
participation.

In order to prepare for the com-
petition, baseline electricity read-
ings will be taken during the last
couple weeks of September.

ESW President Bruk Berhanu
said Facilities Management will
collect electricity usage data from
each residence hall for the duration
of the competition.-

“The Green Team will thenpro-
cess the raw data and turn it into
per-capita reduction,” he said.

Bechtel said the standings will
then be accessible to students in a
variety of ways, including online
in the my.pitt portal and in signs
posted in residence hall lobbies.
Bechtel said that he hopes these
standings will encourage students
to reduce their energy use.

The winning dorm, which will
receive a cash prize, will be deter-
mined by an overall decrease in
energy use per student over the

    

month of October.

Residence halls in the i run-
ning for the prize include Panther
Hall, Pennsylvania Hall, Lothrop,
Sutherland, the Quad (as one unit)
and Litchﬁeld Towers (also as one
unit).

Other residence halls, such
as Forbes Hall, are not eligible to
compete this year due to a difficulty
in measuring energy levels sepa-
rate from the businesses attached
to the halls.

The cash prize is awarded de-
pending on the size of the resi-
dence halls: $500 for Panther Hall
and Pennsylvania Hall, $750 for
Sutherland or Lothrop, and $1,000
for Towers or the Quad.

The Pitt Green Fund, an initia-

' tive established through the Stu-

dent Government Board to spon-
sor student proposals, is funding

the project, while Jim Earle, direc-

tor of Housing and Food Services,
is funding the incentive money.

Bechtel said the cash can be
used by the resident assistants or
resident directors ‘toward an exclu-
sive event.

“I get the impression that RAs
don’t get a lot of money to put on
ﬂoor events,” Bechtel said. “So they
would appreciate this money.”

Wasi Mohamed, executive
board president of the Resident
Student Association, said the idea
of prize money will be a great in-
centive for resident assistants.

“Students often request ideas
for bigger, cool projects, but they
are difficult to pull off with the
[resident assistant’s] budget,” Mo-
hamed said.

Although some elements of en-
ergy use are’ controlled by the resi-
dence halls, project leaders ensure
that efforts will be made to take

said that an official deadline hasn’t been set
yet to complete the upgrade. But businesses
and restaurants on Forbes Avenue should
have faster—operating Panther Funds sys-
tems by the start of the new year.

Murdoch added that he was open to
hearing from students which business-
es they would like to see accept Panther
Funds.

5 Board member Julie Hallinan highlight-
ed a portion of the Collegiate Readership
Program, informing students that they
will have the opportunity to be one of 300
students to have unlimited online access
to USA Today and The New York Times for
24-hour periods. The Collegiate Reader-
ship Program, which distributes 300 cop-
ies of The New York Times and USA Today
to students on campus every weekday, cost
$30,500 in 2012 and is funded by_ the Stu-
dent Activities Fund, the sum of the Student

Activities Fee paid by all undergraduate,
non-College of General Studies students.

“Each day, students can try to be the
ﬁrst to sign—on and have full access to these
sites — no ﬁrewall, No set amount of clicks
before being locked out,” Hallinan said.
“We also have a lot of other cool, free give-
aways through the program that we will be
raffling off from students’ completed cross-
words, so watch out for tha .”

Board members Megan McGrath and
Natalie Rothenberger reminded students

to stop by the William Pitt Union on Fri-

day from 12:25 to 2:25 p.m. to ‘celebrate “I
Heart Pitt Day.” The event, which hands out
free food and T-shirts, offers time to mingle
with Kathy Humphrey, vice provost and
dean of students, and celebrate Pitt.
Students can also enter a video on the
official “I Heart Pitt Day” Facebook page
about why they love Pitt in order to com-
pete for free ﬁeld passes for an upcoming
Pitt football game. Students can win the

contest by garnering the most “likes” on"

Facebook for a video that explains the rea-

 

sons why they love Pitt.’ _
“I hope you all come out this-Friday in
your blue and gold, because it will be a lot
of fun,” Rothenberger said, noting that the
usual Food Committee meeting outside
Market Central will be canceled in place of
the event. “So you should all come if you
like food, friends and fun.” ,
Landreneau closed the meeting with
his ﬁrst “president’s remarks,” imparting
some wisdom on the public. .
“I usually don’t have any president’s

' remarks, but my old high school principal

used to say ‘Hallelujah; It’s a great day to
be aliV.e!”’ he proclaimed. “And so it is, and
this will be my new president’s remark each
week.”

these obstacles into account.

_ “The data we collect will be categorized
based on rooms and outlets so that we can
tell whether a utilities closet is using the en-
ergy or a student,” Berhanu said.

Berhanu said he predicts there will be re-

ductions in energy use, but -it is difficult to say .

by how much. .

“It’s hard to predict. Days will be getting
shorter, so more energy will be used,” he
said. “I believe there will be a reduction as
long as the effort is properly advertised and
students realize how easy it is to reduce their
energies.”

_ Bechtel said the best way to reduce elec-
tricity use is to spend time in places other
than the residence halls.

“Use up places that are already consum-
ing energy, like your favorite coffee shop,” he
said. ,

Bechtel also offered some advice for
conserving energy use within the residence
halls, including light management and cold
and heat conservation.

“Be aware of how you use washers and
dryers. If you use a dryer directly after some-
one else, you can conserve heat and save en-
ergy there,” he said.

I Some other suggestions included turning
off appliances when not in use, using a power
strip and avoiding decorative lighting.

Bechtel said that Pitt has already made
some efforts to reduce energy use,’ such as

installing automatic lights in the classrooms.

However, Bechtel said there is plenty of
room for improvement.

. “We could be doing a lot more. We’ve
looked into optimizing elevator systems in
the Cathedral and optimizing shuttle routes,”
he said. ‘ _

While this is the ﬁrst year of the Panther
Power Down Showdown, Bechtel said-he has
hopes for how the project can improve in the
future. One of these improvements includes
transferring the project from the hands of
ESW to the University.

“The club serves as sf middleman,” he
said. “If it happened from above, it could be
implemented really well.”

Bechtel also said that if Pitt sponsored
the project, there would be more funding to
allow for more speciﬁc and accurate energy
level readings. ’ -

“There is software that gives you real-
time energy usage. If the University could
implement it, we could have individual build-
ings competing against each other, and it
could become much more intimate,” he said.

Such software would also highlight areas
in which Pitt needs to ensure greater energy
efﬁciency.

Forthis year, ESW’s goal is to teach stu-
dents techniques for a more sustainable life-
style.

“with 20,000 undergrads, and a large
amount that live on campus, any small reduc-
tion across a few thousand students will gen-
erate some kind of change,” Berhanu said.

COLUMN ‘

It’s not radical or taboo to be a
feminist in America today

Eric Baldwin
Columnist

What does being feminist

‘mean? What does it mean to be

a feminist today? What does it
mean to not be a feminist? After
learning of the death of promi-
nent feminist writer Shulamith
Firestone, I found__myself think-
ing about my own ideas of the
feminist condition. What I
couldn’t seem to understand is
the current assault on women’s
rights in the public forum.

These thoughts on feminism’

came to a climax this past week-
end when I attended the Micro-
scopic Opera Company’s produc-
tion of “Lizbeth,” a short chamber
opera with feminist motifs about
the murder trial surrounding
Lizzie Borden in 19th century
Massachusetts. After growing up
in an affluent New England home
and having suffered through the
stiﬂing social conventions placed
upon women of the era, she was
accused of murdering her father

to some feminist scholars, Lizzie
did so in an effort to free herself
from her patriarchal oppressors.
The story of Lizzie Borden is set
in an era where women were still
considered inferior, the women’s
rights movement was still aspir-
ing to gain suffrage and equal
rights. In the late 19th century,
feminism was a clandestine and
taboo subculture; few openly
identiﬁed as such and those who
did risked alienating themselves

Senior outside hitter Alexa Campbell tal-
lied a match—high 14 kills in a loss to Seton
Hall on Sunday, but her 21 kills the next
day sparked Pitt’s victory over Rutgers.

Pitt volleyball head coach Toby Rens
lauded Campbell’s performance.

“Alexa has been one of our most con-
sistent players all season,” Rens said. “She
has brought her play to another level, and I
have been impressed with her play in every
aspect of the game.” ’

To Campbell, her performance was the
result of hard work in practice and a desire
to help her team win.

“I am extremely happy with my career-
high 21 kills,” she said. “I always try to
contribute as much as I can togthe offense,
and I am glad that I was able to do that this
weekend.” -

Campbell led all players in kills in both
Big East matches as the Panthers emerged

1-1 from the opening weekend of confer— V

ence play.
Seton Hall 3, Pitt 1

In their ﬁrst conference match of the
season, the Panthers (10-6, 1-1 Big East)
fell to the Seton Hall Pirates (12-1, 1-0 Big
East) in four sets, with scores of 25-15, 25-
18, 25-19 and 25-20.

set of results?

After dropping the ﬁrst set, the Pan-
thers battled back, never relinquishing the
lead in the second set. A large part of theig
success came from the 18 kills they regis-
tered while defensively holding the Pirates
to 10 kills. .

But even after Pitt evened the score,
the momentum in the remaining two sets
went in the way of the Pirates. They led the
fourth set from the 13-12 point. The fourth
set saw seven ties and ﬁve lead changes,
but Seton Hall used a late 6-3 run to secure
the match victory.

A lack of offensive balance contributed
to the loss.

“We did not keep our middle hittexzgr
involved in the offense, and that enabled ‘
Seton Hall to be prepared for our attack,”
Rens said. “We needed to do a better job of
set distribution.”

Seton Hall setter Shelbey Manthorpe
led her team’s winning effort, recording a
triple-double with 12 kills, 34 assists and
16 digs.

Campbell and sophomore outside hitter
Jessica Wynn each had 14 kills in the match.
Defensively, senior libero Margy Acton re-
corded a match—high 22 digs, while sopho-
more setter Lindsey Zitzke contributed 1Q,
digs and 23 assists in her sixth double—dou-L

Panthers continue slide with weekend losses

Donnie Tasser
Staﬁ’ Writer

Big East play has not been kind to the Pitt
women’s soccer team. Following last week-
end’s losses at conference foes Notre Dame
and DePaul, Pitt (5-7-1) remains winless

against conference opposition in its last ‘

season before joining the ACC.

Despite promising results during the
non—conference portion of their schedule,
the Panthers are now 0-3-1 in conference
play and have been outscored 11-2 and out-
shot 99-19 in those four games.

Pitt head coach Greg Miller feels the
shooting stats mislead.

“The ball could be 25 yards over the
goal or 20 yards Wide and it constitutes a
shot,” Miller said. .

But he does admit the team’s inability
to possess has hindered its performance.

“Our biggest problem is we can’t keep
the ball,” he said. “We are simply giving it
away too much, turning it over in bad spots
and that leads to too many shots and cor-

ners and also means we aren’t getting any
offense started ourselves.”

Notre Dame 2, Pittsburgh 1

Despite feeling -conﬁdent going into
the match, Pitt struggled once the whistle
blew.

“We had a pretty good game plan, in-
tensity, and energy in the pregame,” Mill-

, er said. “Notre Dame is a very good team;

young, but very talented, and they were
able to put a lot of nice stuff together. They
ﬁred a lot of shots, but Nicole [sophomore
goalkeeper Nicole D’Agostino] was able to
keep us in the game.”

Notre Dame (6-3-1, 3-0-0 in Big East)
took a 1-0 lead from a goal in the 16th min-
ute. The Fighting Irish then added to their
lead just 14 minutes into the second half.

Pitt 3, Rutgers 2 '

The Panthers rebounded from their
loss on Saturday and earned a hard-fought
ﬁve-set victory over Rutgers (14—3, 0-2 Big
East).

The match had set scores of 33-31, 25-17,
25-23, 25-17 and 15-11.

in the deciding set and held on to win the
match. -

-“We fought hard for this win, and I was
particularly pleased with our mental focus,
especially in the long opening set,” Rens
said. “We were able to maintain the mo-
mentum from that ﬁrst set and carried all
the way through to the end of the ﬁfth set.”

Campbell led all players with her 21
kills and 12 digs — a double—double per-
formance. Wynn and junior outside hitter
Monicawignot also ﬁnished with double-

During the ﬁrst
set, neither team held
a lead of more than
four points. At the
31-31 mark, the Pan-
thers used a Scarlet
Knights error and a
kill by junior’ Marfa
Nicholas to take the
set.-

Pitt led from the
1-1 point in the sec— .
ond set en route to a
25-17 victory. Wynn

digit kills, recording
14 and 16, respec-
tively.

“We did a better
job of keeping every-

offense,” Campbell
said. “That is some-
thing that we were
able to change from
the Seton Hallloss.”
Acton led the way
‘ defensively for the
Panthers, once again,
with her 26 digs.

four kills in the set.
In the third and fourth sets, the Scarlet
Knights managed to out-perform the Pan-
thers onoffense, recording more digs in
both sets. The Panthers-managed to keep
both sets close, coming within one at the
20-21 mark in the third set and within four
at the 17-21 point in the fourth, but the
Scarlet Knights ﬁnished both sets on runs.
The Panthers secured an early 8-3 lead

“We were‘ able
to have solid de-
fense throughout the match,” Acton said.

-“Against Seton Hall, we were stuck in a few

rotations, but we moved. and responded to
the ball much better in the Rutgers match.”

Friday, Sept. 28, as they host Big East op-
ponent Cincinnati at the Fitzgerald Field

86th minute, ﬁnding a loose ball in front of
the net for her second score of the season
and pulling Pitt within one goal late in the
game. -
“We had a corner kick, and they cleare

_it out,” Cuba said. “We got it back and put

it to the back corner like we are taught. I
worked my way into the box and the ball
ricocheted off a player’s chest and I was
there to put it in.”

D’Agostino made seven saves -in thealoss.
After_ the weekend, she had the second-
most saves in the Big East at 59. Notre
Dame outshot Pitt 21-6 (9-2 on goal) in the
game. Cuba ﬁnished the game with four
shots -- one of which was on goal.

“We were able to score a sloppy goal

late and changed formation to try and A‘
manufacture the tying goal in the closing

minutes, but we weren’t able to get it,” she
said. “Overall, though, I was pleased with
the execution of our team. I really thought
we played well against a quality opponent.”

DePaul 4, Pittsburgh 0

“Against DePaul, our consistency, en—-
ergy and effort just weren’t there in a very
winnable game,” Miller said. “Give credit
to DePaul, we simply didn’t match their
intensity. Our soccer just was never great.”

After going into: halftime tied at zero,
the Panthers imploded in the second half
and DePaul (7-4-1, 2-1-0 in Big East) hand-
ed Pitt its second loss of the weekend. The
Blue Demons broke the game open with
three goals in a four-minute span, and add-
ed an insurance goal later in the half.

“Nicole kept us in the game again with

some sick saves in the ﬁrst hal ,”‘ Miller ‘

said. “But we came out slow in the second.
I didn’t expect this outcome. I, felt like this
was a very winnable game. If we had the in-
tensity and energy from Friday, I think we
could have won, but we were just never in
the game mentally, and that’s frustrating?

D’Agostino made seven saves on 10
shots and redshirt senior Kristina Rioux
played the last 24 minutes in the net, sav-
ing two of three shots. Cuba, sophomore
Taylor Parisse and freshman Janna Brown
all ﬁnished with one shot on net.

“It’s frustrating,” D’Agostino said. “You
can’t win if you can’t score goals and right
now it seems the best we can do is/‘tie. The
defense and goaltending can only do so
much. We need to all get back in sync with
each other and then» we will start winning
again. Everybody needs to have the right
attitude this week in practice and going
into this weekend.”

Pittsburgh hosts Villanova and No.
19-ranked Georgetown on Friday, Sept. 28,
and Sunday, Sept. 30, respectively. Both
games will be played at Ambrose Urbanic
Field. I I ‘
