Afrer a year of sirhn
a temporary basis,
make himself at home: the job is now his. But
where does he plan to take Pitt from here?

On August 12, Chancellor Mark Nordenberg sat
down with The Pitt News to talk about the direc-
tion in which Pitt is heading, in education, in
sports, in its campus structure, and in a host of

S other areas. Here then, is a ﬁrst glimpse into what

Nordenberg had to say about the direction he
plans to lead Pitt this year and throughout his
term. What follows is a transcript of the interview
edited for space.

What do you think is Pitt’s role in the world
holistically, and in Pittsburgh and toward the
students?

Itdoes seemtomethatthatquestionreallycanbe
separated into multiple parts when you talk about
Pitt and its new era and the role it’s going to play
in the nation or the world It is my hope that Pitt
will, over the course of the next several years,
really cement its position as one of the ﬁnest pub-
lic universities in the country. These will be chal-
lenging times for the University of Pittsburgh. 
But it seems to me often what distinguishes either
individuals or institutions of strength from others
is the way in which they respond to challenging
times, and I hope that we’re committed to and
well positioned to moving forward effectively
and creatively.

We are an institution that already does
have a national and international reputation for
the quality of our work in many areas. There is,
in my mind, nothing incompatible with having

in the chancellor's office on
ark Nordenberg can finally

strong local or regional roots and yet having an
impact which is far broader and more distant
because of the quality of what it is you do.  I
always have felt that...that we had a fundamental
mission to provide students at all levels with the
oppom °ty to realize their full potential.

How do you see your role in making the grand
vision of Pitt become a reality?

Ithinkthere areanumberofimportantaspects of
my role as it’s emerging. The ﬁrst is to work
etfectively with people on campus to make this
thebestplacethatitcanbe. One irnportantpart of
that process is putting together the kind of lead-
ershipteamthatlthinkwillbeabletocapitalize
on opportunities and meet challenges in the years
ahead. There are a number of important positions
thatwillbeﬁlledinthecourseofthenextyear.
How successful we are at recruiting the most
committed and talented people for those posi-
tions will have a big impact on how successful
we are in the years ahead. Looking beyond that
leadership team, I really am a person who has
always felt that large numbers of people in the
campus community have contributions to make
in terms of advancing the institution. One of the
things that I’m probably best known for are the
constructive relationships that I have with a broad
range of campus groups. I think that we did see a
new form of momentum emerging during the

course ofthepastyeanltwillbeimportantforusv

'l'l-IE PI'l"I' NEWS

to keep that march forward on pace in the months
and years and head.

Ifl was to make a basic division, the
second major function of this position is to be the
University’s principle voice to and advocate in
the external community, whether you’re talking
about generating good will of a general type in
tenns of public opinion. Whether you’re talking
about raising the kinds of private dollars that can
provide the University with its margin of excel-
lence in terms of prograrrrrning, or whether
you’re talking about cementing the partnership
with the commonwealth that for the last 30 years
has been so important to Pitt. All of those respon-
sibilities really also sit at the door of the chancel-
lor’s oﬂice, though many other people also are
involved in advancing those causes. Over the
course of time, I guess one of the real challenges
will be striking the right balance between time
investments on campus and time investments
with the outside world. In either case, working to
advance Pitt’s cause.

Do you like your job?

Since I had the better part of a year to try it, before
anyone asked whether I was interested in and
willing to stay, it would be somewhat humiliating
for me after just a few weeks to say, “No, I don’t
like it” It is a very diﬁicult and demanding job,
but it is a job that canies with it a variety of
rewards. One...that I am involved in a noble pur-
suit. I think that helping-people grow and sup-
poning the expansion of knowledge are two
wonderful things, and as chancellor, I have a spe-
cial opportimity to contribute to both. I also have
a special opportunity to contribute to an institu-
tion which has been my home for almost 20
years.  I liketo thinkthatlhave advanced these
causes as a faculty member, as dean of the Law
School, as interim provost, but serving as
Chancellor gives me a new opportunity to con-
tribute to Pitt It is a position that I think by deﬁ-
nition requires a great deal of interaction with
other human beings. Andbecause Ilike people,I
like that part of the job. And fortunately, I am a
guy who likes to work

With the pressures that eduwtion is facing
there are a lot of people who say Pitt needs to

focus on what it’s good at and let the other

programs be mediocre or get rid of them
entirely. How do you think that ﬁts in in terms
of where Pitt is going? Should we try to prior-
itizeorbeamaioruniversitywiﬂ1astronglib-
eral arts component?

Because we are a large public university, we
always will have some real breadth to the scope
of our programs. I do think, though, that we must
engage in a process of establishing priorities. We
must identify the areas in which we can truly
excel in the sense of performing at levels at least
as good as anyone else and nurturing those areas
very consciously. Over the course of the last few
years, through the planning process that was
launched and some of the ﬁscally related deci-
sions that were made, we have in fact begun that
process. '

Where are we focusing our priorities?

In the broadest sense, the planning docmnent that

 

 

August 26, 1 996

was released in 1994, identiﬁed the arts and sci-
ences, medicine, engineering, business, and law
as units that had to be strong if the University of
Pittsburgh as a whole was to be strong. I don’t
think there has been any retreat from that state-
ment.  That list is not all encompassing.
Certainly there are other schools and programs
that also are of the highest quality or on the verge
that are entitled to special consideration.
Particularly in these economically challenging
times, being a priority does not guarantee a ﬂow
of resources. In some way, it almost places a spe-
cial burden on those associated with the program
or school to continually demonstrate that they are
living up to institutional expectations and are
deserving of that status as it were.

Who makes these evaluations, is that going to
be Peter Koehler, the dean of Arts and
Sciences, or is that something you and Provost
Maher will be discussing?

Whenever you talk about important institutional
planning, there is involvement at a number of
levels. Certainly the Provost and I both are very
interested, but there would also be involvement at
the unit level. In fact, it is those within a school or
department, who actually know its programs
best, who ought to be in the best position to pri-
oritize, but obviously then priorities have got to
be established that extend beyond particular units
as well.

What about regional campuses? There’s
always talk about how we spend so much
money having regional campuses and would-
n’t it be better spent at Pitt. What are your
thoughts on this?

We have four regional campuses: Bradford,
Greensburg, Johnstown, and Titusville. Their
perspectives" on the ﬁnancial relationship
between their campuses and Oakland would be

quite different. That is they are undergraduate‘

institutions with relatively high student-faculty
ratios that contribute more ﬂran their fair share to
the common good. I’m not embracing either
view, but would say that we have a system of
regional campuses that is geographically sensi-
ble, spread throughout the western part of the
state and that actually is quite manageable in size
when ‘you compare it to for example, the Penn
State Commonwealth Campus system which has
many many many more regional operations. As
time has unfolded, each of our regional campus-
es seems to have developed a somewhat distinct

program thrust and educational identity. While

there are issues to be faced with each of them just
as there are issues on the Oakland campus, most
them seem to be healthy both in the quality of
ﬂreir programs and in economic terms.

We -want to attract a higher numerical level of
students. Is that Pitt’s job to attract them, or
to set it’s standards to exclude students with
lower scores, G.P.A.s, etc?

It’s our job to have the ldnd of programs and mar-

ket them in such a way that they attract highly.

qualiﬁed, committed, and ambitious students. We
want to be known as a university that provides an
undergraduate education that is at the high end of

the spectrum, as a university that involves stu-

 

 

Monday, August 26, I996

dents in challenging educational experiences that
equip them to deal with the challenges we know
they will face in a changing world. If we’re
known as the institution that provides the type of
programs that produce truly well—educated grad-
uates, then we will attract the students that we
seek.

In a world increasingly focused on job train-
ing and viability in the work place, is there
anything you think everyone needs to know to
be a well-educated person? Should they have
that before coming to Pitt or get it once they
get here?

Particularly in higher education it seems to me
that the best training that one can provide is not
technical in any sense because we do know that
most of our graduates will work through periods
of signiﬁcant social and economic change and
also will hold a variety of diﬁerent jobs over the
course of work careers that may span 40 or 50
years. So, at the undergraduate level in particular,
our goal should be to provide an education that is
broad in nature, that emphasizes critical thinking,
communications skills, and the ability to under-
stand, adapt to, and constructively change the
world that people will ﬁnd beyond the campus
the day they graduate and 10 years down the
road.

With all the undergraduate retention prob-
lerns, what do you think we should change at
Pitt? .

We took a close look at our retention rates last
year. We discovered that even in our worst years,
our record is quite favorable when compared to
comparable institutions. What had happened,
though, was that we had been enjoying a truly
exceptional record in terms of our retention rates,
and we had fallen off our own traditions of per-
formance. I can’t offer a single solution, but ifI
hadtoidentifytwoorthreeareasthatlthinkdo
impact retention, and are deserving of our atten-
tion, they would include, ﬁrst, enhancing the ser-
vice orientation of some of the campus units that
interact regularly with students. It simply is true
that we can do a better job of meeting student
needs in some areas.

What speciﬁcally?

I won’t say that, but I think ifyou guessed as to
what was on my mind, you probably would not
be far off.

_ A second would be generally enhanc-
ing the quality of campus life, particularly per-
haps for undergraduates and for resident students.
I do think, that the educational experience
expands beyond the formal classroom hour and
that there are ways in which we could enrich the
broader experience. That is to some extent
reﬂected in the decisions embedded in the budget
for next year where we are making investments
in more campus recreation facilities, where we
are launching the program, that will span several ~
years,towirea1lthedormrooms.Thosethings
will prove to be important. '

What we do ﬁnd perhaps as the single
most common reason that students drop out..is
 nota
bargain public education available to

THE PITT NEWS

Pennsylvania students. What that means is we
need to continually work both to increase the size
of the state appropriation and to raise private
funds to support the scholarship programs that
might ease some of the dollar pressures felt by a
lot of students.

Our State appropriation was lws than what
we asked for this year. How do things look for
State frmding in the coming years?

If you looked at Pemisylvania 20 years ago, the
State appropriation would have represented
roughly 34 percent of our total budget Today
we’re down to 17 or 18 percent. And if you look
at the other public universities in the Association
of American Universities, those schools with
which we most directly compete, the typical pub-

been less etfective in generating support from
within the alumni group. That probably is a func-
tion both of transitions in leadership and some of
the negative publicity associated with the
University over the course of the last few years.
One of the real challenges we face then is to gen-
erate higher levels of support from within the
alumni group, both in terms of the number of
donors and in terms of the number of dollars. I do
believe there is a reservoir of good will out there
that will respond to necessary.

Does anyone ever get hired around here, or do
we have a search committee for everything?

There is a strong and long tradition of participa-
tory searches for institutional leaders. VV1th the
understanding support of both Keith McDuffre,

has expressed the

Clearly we will
continue to work to
achieve that goal,
but only time will
tell just how suc-
cessful we will be at
it

Sohow do weplan, while we’retalking about
funding, to get the Board of'Ii'ustees partici-
pation up to 100 percent?

In tenns of their own ﬁnancial contributions...the
level of trustee support for the university
increased dramatically dining this last year. The
last time I could recall checking, they went up
two and half times. I think that level of increased
giving is just one sign of a dramatically increased
sense of overall involvement by the trustees
which has produced tangible results for Pitt, not
only interms of their individual gifts,.butintenns
of help they’ve provided in securing gifts from
others, and in tenns of the help they’ve provided
in our governmental relations. ‘

What about Alumni giving?

We have seen that the most generous supporters
have been the foundations, groups that I think can
be characterized as professional donors. They
assess program quality at a variety of
before making their grant decisions. We have

There is a commit-
tee in place to
investigate other
modes of commu-
nication between
students, faculty
and staff, and the
Board of Trustees
Committees and
removing these
three groups from
the committees.
What do you think
about students having a place on the Board of
Trustees Committees?

In my experience students, faculty, and staif have
made constructive contributions to work of at
least some trustee committees. Whether or not
those contributions can be preserved while giving
thetrusteesmorefreedomtoactastrusteecorn-
mitteesisthechargethathasbeengiventothead
hoc committee. I really don’t know what they
will conclude.

WhatdoestherestoftheBoardthink?

I do know that at least one committee of the
board had fairly strong feelings about the issue,
believing that trustee committees really should be
for the trustees and that trustees currently did not
have suﬂicient opportunities to act in meaningful
ways with each other. But I really cannot speak
about the board as a whole and the views that
might be represented there.

Inseveralforu_rm,peoplehavesuggestedthat

the use of the University of Pittsburgh name
by the Presbyterian University Hospital has
hurt fund raising eﬂ'orts. While lines of
responsibility aren’t clear, it seems the use of
the name was licensed through the chancel-
lor’s oﬂice. Do you have any plans to remove
that license?

Some of the most signiﬁcant accomplishments in
this university... have been made possible by the
relationship between the medical center and the
University. I understand when some raise the
question about the impact of medical center pur-
chases on our own University initiatives to raise
money, but I have not yet seen any tangible neg-
ative etfect. I do see the general image of the
University beneﬁting ﬁorn the reputation for
excellence that exists within the health sciences.
That has been supported by the medical center
system I certainly have no plans to remove it.

Speaking of the image of the University, one of
theissuesthathascomeupinthatregardlate-
ly is the planito close Bigelow. The opinion at
Pittisthatthiswouldbegoodforcreatinga

I’m not sure how this particular issue ultimately
will be resolved. but I am committed to moving
forward with campus development in ways that
are good for our students but at the same time are
respectful for our neighbors. As things stand
today there will be a test closing for September.
We do hope that the results of the experimental

Last year was a year of troubles for
the Greek system, but, after making
some sweeping changes, Pitt stu-
dents and administrators are ready to
rebuild Greek values this coming
fall.

Last year, seven fraternities were
suspended or had their charters
revoked for violations ranging from
hazing to drug abuse.

In response to the onslaught of fra-
ternity crimes, Pitt formed an
Advisory Board dedicated to pin-
pointing problem areas in the Greek

THE PI'I"I' NEWS

Greeks plan a rebuilding year to emphasize values

system and finding solutions for
returning them to Greek values. The
Board consists of three committees:
Policies, Social Programming, and
Campus and Public Image.

Two graduate assistants were also
added to the Greek Advisory Office
for development of new member and
risk education. A new Greek guide-
line and policy booklet was issued to
each chapter for the upcoming year
with more strict guidelines and new
rules on pledging, including the poli-
cy that freshmen must wait until their
second semester in order to pledge.

With all these changes taking
place, and the Greek system under

such scrutiny by the media, the big
question on everyone’s mind is: what
are Greek values?

Pitt currently has 37 Greek organi-
zations, each with different goals and
purposes. The four basic values
which each chapter shares are acade-
mics, community service, leadership,
and friendship.

Within each chapter, other pro-.

grams are developed -for the benefit
of the members. Sigma Delta Tau has
a “Sober Sister” program, which has
at least three designated sober sisters
at mixers who watch over the other
sisters, walk them home in groups
from parties, and stay half an hour

everyone gets home safely. Other
chapters have similar programs.

Members can also benefit from the
education officers in each chapter.
They work to inform each house on
pertinent issues such as health, job
placement, and overall wellness.

“I think that it’s been a wonderful
opportunity socially and for develop-
ing my leadership skills within the
Greek system, as well as outside,”
Cecily Tibbs said.

Sigma Phi Epsilon has its own
motto, which SGB President Andy
Wuertele, a brother, states as the
“integrity and development” of the

' individual.

The biggest event for Greekseach
year is Greek Week, a time set aside
in the spring in which fraternities and
sororities can unite and raise money
for an organization. Last year,
$107,000 was raised. This year’s co-
chairs, Tibbs and Dan Keane, are
already planning Greek Week. The
proceeds are to go. to the Make-A-
Wish Foundation. Throughout the
year, Greeks also sponsor blood and
food drives. -

According to some Greeks, all of
the good the fraternities and sorori-
ties often do is usually overshad-
owed by the scandals that make front
page news around the country. This
year, the determination to overcome
the negatives lingering from last
year’s disrepute is unyielding from

Imagine not having to dodge traffic
going between the Student Union and the
Cathedral. Well, as of September 16, that
picture will no longer come from an over-
active imagination, it will be a reality.

On September 16, Pitt, along with the
city of Pittsburgh, will close down the block
of Bigelow Boulevard between Fifth
Avenue and Forbes Avenue. This trial clos-
ing will last for one month, according to oili-
cials.

Ken Service, Pitt spokesman, said, “We
don’t want to make the closing an event —
just let the events planned stand for them-
selves.”

Service didn’t want the event of the
closing to take away ﬁom the special events
plarmed for the closing. These events include
the Mademoiselle Tour, the Jeep Eagle Tour,
Homecoming festivities, and Campus Fest.

“We want to demonstrate that there are
activities that can occur here without spend-
ing more money [than ‘usual],” saidlay
Roling, director of local governmental rela-
tions at the University. A

The City Council vote in favor of the
test closing caused a ﬁre of controversy that
Pitt ofﬁcials are now struggling to put out.

“A task force encompassing the many
academic departments, the student affairs
department, alumni atfairs and many other
departments has been working with the City
to make sure that this runs smoothly,” said
Roling. '

Roling said that Pitt hired a consultant to
work directly with Bob Harkins, director of
transportation, and the City Planning
Department, to help with this process.

“This trial closing is our opportunity to
gather important data,” said Harkins. “We
did preliminary traﬂic counts and intersec-
tion studies, and this will prove if they were
correct.”

Several Oakland businesses expressed
concerns about lost business when this clos-
ing was proposed, but Roling doesn’t feel
that will be as big a problem as they thought.

“Most of our commercial sector in
Oakland is the walking type,” said Roling.
“For the most part, people don’t drive a dis-
tance to Oakland to shop.”

However, oﬂicials have said that they
will not be neglecting the businesses either.
“We will be observing the loss of parking
and the City Planning Department is work-
ing with the Oakland merchants as well,”
said Roling.

Pitt students, much like the community,
surrounding them, are divided by the issue.

“It would make things more accessible
for the students, plus it would add to the
beauty of the campus,” saidleff Laugherty,
a Pitt sophomore. p '

Many students share this view of the
school acquiring the plot of land, but those
that drive to school tend to see it differently.

‘This is going to  tenible for traffic.
There are a lot more students than just the

ones that live here,” said Justin Wllott, a Pitt -

senior.

 

Bigelow
Boulevard, as
seen from the

Cathedral of
learning, will
shut down to
vehicle traffic
for a 30-day

trial period
beginning
September 16.

This year, transportation to, from, and around
campus, day or night, promises to be easier and
cheaper than ever before for Pitt students, faculty,
and staff.

Thanks to_ new negotiations between Pitt and
Pittsburgh’s Port Authority Transit (PAT), the Pitt
Zone has been expanded, bus passes are at a reduced
rate for students, and bus fares outside the Pitt Zone
are 50 cents after 7 p.m. Add this to the eight regu-
larly running Pitt shuttles, special event shuttles, and
more van call service hours, and walking may soon
be obsolete.

Currently, Pitt students, faculty, and staff may ride
any of the PAT buses within the Pitt Zone for free

 

 

PAT expands range of busing services to Pitt students

with a current, validated ID. In Oakland, the zone
has now expanded to Craft Avenue and runs down
Forbes Avenue. In Squirrel Hill, the zone is framed
by Wightman, Forward, and South Dallas Avenues.
In Shadyside, Centre Avenue and Penn Avenue draw
the Pitt Zone line. The buses running in the zone
include the 61A, B, or C; 71A, B, C, or D; 67A; 67F;
and the 54C. Any ride within these parameters is
covered.

If your trip takes you outside this zone, however,
you will "have to pay full fare during weekdays. A
nighttime or weekend trip outside the Pitt Zone will
only cost ID holders 50 cents, but transfers, rides to
any other PAT zone, or guests are extra.

Pitt shuttle buses run on the same “ID required”
system. A ride anywhere on a'Pitt shuttle is covered,

There's more to cl at Pitt than just go to class

 

Pitt students can explore their inter-
ests and get involved in a university
organization. It’s a great way to meet
new people, build up a resume, or
make a positive change on campus.

Here are some of the groups Pitt
students can join. However, due to the
inability for many organization to
speak on their behalf during the sum-
mer, this list in no way reﬂects all of
the organizations students can
become active in.

Be sure to check out The Pitt
News for listings about when and
where student group meetings will
occur in the fall. Students are also
encouraged to telephone or stop by
the organization they are interested in.

Student Government Board

The SGB is composed of ten dif-
ferent committees representing gov-
ernment relations to academic affairs
to environmental awareness. The pur-
pose of SGB is to advocate and repre-
sent the student body’s needs and con-
cerns. Students are able to work on
any of the committees, or are encour-
aged to create their own.

Two of the largest events occur-
ring this fall are a voter registration

and an education drive, which will
occur through September, and the
Pittsburgh Project, a one-day volun-
teer event across the city, also in
September.

“Student Government Board is a
wonderful way to get started and get
involved. The students can start mak-
ing Pitt the kind of university they
want it to be,” said Andy Wuertele,
SGB president.

Black Action Society

BAS organizes social gatherings,
lectures, study sessions, and other
activities to unify and support black
students, faculty, and administration.

Some events BAS has sponsored
in the past include picnics with ven-
dors, music, food and games, fashion
and talent shows, voter registration,
and various celebrations during Black
History Month.

“BAS is here to educate not only
black students but the entire campus,”
said BAS President Janera Solomon.
“We are trying to meet the education-
al, political, and social needs of all
students from a black perspective. If
you get involved with BAS you make
decisions that affect the whole cam-
pus.”

The first social event, Indaba, will
be held September 6 at 7 p.m. in the

Kurtzman Room at the William Pitt
Union. All are encouraged to attend.

Pitt Program Council

Pitt Program Council helps meet
the social, cultural, recreational, and
educational needs of the University
population by organizing and spon-
soring programs for students.

Broken down into committees
such as publicity, leisure activities,
lectures, and travel, students are
involved in each activity from the
idea stage to the clean—up stage.

In the past, some of the events the
PPC has provided are films every
Friday and Saturday night, lectures
given by Billy Joel and Maya
Angelou, and spring break travel
packages to destinations such as
Florida and Mexico.

“We like to believe we do some-
thing for everybody. If there is some-
thing you want to see happen, get
involved,” said Tom Misuraca, assis-
tant director of student activities.

Jewish University Center,
Hillel Foundation

An educational, cultural and
social service organization for Jewish
life, the Jewish University Center
attracts students from all of the sur-

rounding Pittsburgh colleges to attend
Friday night services, Shabbat dinners
which begin every Friday at 7 p.m.,
and community services.

Activities such as the P.B. Jam,
which was held last October on the
patio of the William Pitt Union,
involved the making and dispersing of
peanut—butter-and—jelly sandwiches
for food banks in the surrounding
Pittsburgh area. In addition, a cruise
on the Gateway Clipper and welcome
barbecue are held to help people meet
who are involves with the Hillel
Foundation. .

“These past years have been
incredible with over 1,000 people
coming to Hillel events and programs.
It’s a great way to meet people,” said
Jane Berger, a student at the
University of Pittsburgh.

Universiw Democrats,
College epublicans

Promoting the interests and ideals
of their respective parties, in the last
year these groups have hosted lectures

I given by local politicians, supported

voter registration, and have held
meetings with other university clubs.

First that whiney, wheezing cough
comes. Then that hollow thud in your
head follows. Nausea, dizziness, a
rash  Now what?

Student Health Service has numer-
ous services for students. With the
high cost of medical care, the $46
health fee pays for the services pro-
vided by student health and offers a lot
of care for full—time students. More
services are included than many-stu-
dents realize.

Student health is equipped to do
general practice medicine, most lab
work, including HIV testing, on—site
radiology (X—rays), allergy injections,
health education, and has various
counseling groups. I

In the past, student health employed
only two nurse practitioners to serve
the walk-in students. This has
changed. There will be six full—time
nurse practitioners, eight nurses, two
full—time physicians, and many part-

time physicians from throughout the I

medical center to aid in addressing
student concerns.

But being seen at the clinic is not
always a picnic, and rarely takes just a
few minutes.

“[Students must] understand that

they can’t come in, be seen, be treated,

and leave in 10 minutes between
classes,” said Cheryl Miller, the clinic
manager. “If they’re going to come
here, they’re going toneed to plan to

_'l'|-IE PI'l"l' NEWS

be here an hour. Bring something to do
so they won’t feel like they’re here
wasting their time.”

If students don’t have an appoint-
ment but go early in the day, they will
have less time to wait and a better
chance of being seen, according to
Miller. Students should also try to
avoid going during
lunch hour, which
usually has the
longest wait time.

The clinic will
prescribe the
required medicine
for illnesses, and
student health is
also equipped with
a ' pharmacy.
Pharmacy hours
are from 9 a.m. to
8:30 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

“We don’t handle everything,” said
Joseph Mance’, chief pharmacist. “We
handle a lot of the more common,
more popular over-the-counter items

suited to this population. Our price
system is designed to keep prices real
low and very reasonable.”

The pharmacy also handles patient
counseling, where they explain what
the medicine is about, what it’s for,
how to take it properly, and when not
to take it.

After students
have taken their

medicine and
regained their
health, the health
education office

provides many ser-
vices for students
who are not sick
and want to stay
healthy.
“Certainly, a
student can take
the opportunity to
see us when they
don’t feel well, or better yet they can

be proactive and see us while they still

feel good and hopefully take some
steps to enhance their future perfor-

 

mance,” said Shirley Haberman,
health education administrator. ‘‘I
think we offer a lot of health promo-
tion programs that are geared towards
helping students look better and feel
better.”

Some of these services offered
include the Adult Children of
Alcoholics Support Group, stress
management and substance abuse pre-
vention programs, tobacco cessation
consultations, CPR and First Aid
courses, and many more.

For many students, the “Freshman
20” has become a reality. The health
education office, along with the many
support groups, has a dietician on staff
who provides weight control pro-
grams, nutrition counseling, and eat-
ing concerns consultations.

“I think that it’s a valuable service. I
think that a lot of students who try to
do weight loss on their own find that
they run into ‘financial problems [or
health problems],” said Debbie
Luffey, dietician. “I think that if some-
one is interested in weight loss this
would be a valuable service. Also we

_ offer diverse services for nutrition, so

it’s not just weight loss.”

The health education office also
maintains a resource center that has
journals, videos, articles,
brochures on different health related
topics for students to use for writing
research papers. A newsletter called
“Health Wise” is also published by

Matt Lytle has been around
the Pitt football program since
1994. During that time the
Panthers have gone 5-17 and have
suffered six and nine game losing
streaks. As a redshirt freshman,
Lytle could do little but watch and
wait. Lytle again watched from the
sidelines for most of 1995 before

Syracuse after Pete Gonzalez.

went down with a season-ending
knee injury.

The 6—foot—4-inch, 225
pounder threw for 200 yards on
20-38 passing and one TD against
the Orangemen. In the season ﬁnal
against West Virginia Lytle was a
respectable 17-29 for 99 yards.

When spring practice rolled
around, the starting job was open
for the man who wanted it most.
Lytle was that man. He impressed
coaches with his powerful arm
and agility, and the waiting was
over, he was named the starter. But
Pitt football wouldn’t be the same
without indecision and controver-

sy.

“Matt won the job during the

spring but it was a combination of
a couple things, but nothing is 100
percent sure yet,” offensive coor-
dinator Ken Karcher said. “Matt
did have a very good spring, he
really has a lot of ability. He can
run and throw well and he’s a big,
strong ki .”

Majors said the job was still open

 Unlike Gonzalez and
Dinkins, this news didn’t sit well
with the powerful lefty.

“I don’t  this is good for
the team at all. I feel that they have
to single out their starter and go
with one guy,” Lytle said "Ihat’s
what hurt us before, like last year
with John Ryan, (Sean) Fitzgerald
and Pete.iYou just can’t do that,
you’ve got to have one quarter-
back and stick with that guy.”

Throughout fall camp, Lytle
watched as Gonzalez and

competition was there in his mind,
but he still kept the team ﬁrst.

8 ~ Standing“-at -6-foot-2 and]

weighing at least 245 pounds,
Pitt defender Jason Chavis
stands out in a crowd, even
when that crowd is a football
team. _

Then you add equal parts
of intensity and desire and real-
ize that Chavis will create
nightmares for opposing
offenses this season.

“Jason is an aggressive
player and he’s had a good pre-
season,” Head Coach Johrmy
Majors said. “We are glad to
have him back out there and in
good shape physically.”

Many may not remember
Chavis. Last season, ‘he
received a medical redshirted
after leading the 1994 defense
with 98 total tackles as a mid-
dle linebacker. This season,
Chavis will play left defensive
end. ’

“I was frustrated all of last
season,” Chavis said of sitting
out. “Somebody asked me what
did I learn from sitting out.
Well, I learned that I don’t ever
wanna do it again. I’m just anx-

 

ious to play.” «

Chavis probably won’t sit
much this season, despite com-
petition from Marlin Young for
a starting position during camp.
The Pitt defense will desperate-
ly need Chavis.

With seven starters lost to
graduation and the suspension
of comerback Denorse Mosely,
Chavis returns to the lineup as
one of the few Panther defend-
ers with signiﬁcant gametime
experience, although all his
experience came at linebacker.

“The most difﬁcult thing
[about the transition to end] is
that it isn’t a reaction thing any
more,” Chavis said. “At line-
backer, I could read things.
Now, I have to read on the run.”

With the relative inexperi-
ence of the Panther defense, the
younger guys will look upon
Chavis and safety John Jenkins
to not only lead by example but
to let them know when they’re
doing something right or
wrong.

Chavis, a native of nearby
McKeesport, feels up to the
challenge.

“A lot of people think that
the team leader is the guy who

does all the interviews and gets
all the press,” Chavis said. “I
think ateam leader is being the
guy who gets the other guys
pumped up on third-and-one.
That’s the kind of guy I am. I’m
always talkin’ during the
game.”

It will take more than talk-
ing to help out a defense that
last season yielded 29.9 points
per game, 408.4 yards per
game and a 40.2 third-down
percentage. The defense ranked
55th in the nation against the
run, 73rd against the pass and
81st in points allowed.

Chavis should help con-
tlibute to the new Panther atti-
tude, which saw 28 pre-season
weightroom records fall, but
faces total reconstruction
defensively. _

“It’s quite obvious that w
have to rebuild the defense
pretty much,” Majors said.
“The entire linebacking corps
is no small feat, as well as
defensive line.”

But this year’s Panther
squad appears to be stronger
and faster than any other unit in
the school’s football-rich histo-

KOVC|l( reminisces about a very painful four years

ood day, and once again I welcome
GU of you back to the University of

Pittsburgh for yet another smashing
season of sports success.

Over the last four years this school has
enjoyed more victories and championships
than any other university in the country.

Yes, that’s right. Hey i_ifth—year seniors,
remember the joys of the 1992 NCAA
National Championship won by our valiant
basketball team? Or how about that win in
the Doritos/Olive Garden/John
Deere/Adam & Eve/Grassy Knoll Bowl?
The memories never seem to fade.

( There seems to be a scuﬁle going on.)

Hey, what the hell are you doing? That
hurt, you prick! Don’t ever punch me in the

solai-plexus again. Got it?

Okay, now that I’ve been snapped out
of my spell, it’s time to inform the unin-
formed public (namely freshmen) about the
woes all the rest of us have suffered through
over the years.

If music were set to this column an
appropriate number might be the Grateful
Dead’s version of “Goin’ Down the Road
Feelin’ Bad”, but if you don’t know the
time, any sad song says enough.

Anyway, what you are about to embark
upon is enough to make a grown man cry.
This is the sad, but true, story of Pitt sports.

I would be remiss not to say that Pitt
has actually had some outstanding teams
here in the last four years. Last year’s men’s

soccer team surprised the Big East, the
wresﬂing team has maintained its usual
level of excellence, the swimming and div-
ing teams usually do well, the baseball team
has done decent, and the fiisbee golf team
always ﬁnishes top 10.

Wllll that aside, let’s now focus on the
two sports that pack the rafters ﬁom coast-
to-coast, LA to Chicago: football and men’s
basketball.

Let’s face it, football has been ugly.
Over the last four years, the Pitt football
team has won 11 games, that’s one less than
National Champion Nebraska won last
year.

If any of you out there are like me (if

Lothrop Fitness Center is the
latest addition to the Pitt athletic
facilities. The fitness center, which
opened in January 5th of the last
spring semester has attracted a
diverse group of students.

The center accommodates all
Pitt students, both graduate and
undergraduate. However, staff and
faculty are not permitted to use the
facility.

According to Marilyn Ross, co-
director of the Intramural and
Recreation Department, the fitness

center cost a

During the fall and spring
terms, physical trainers and consul-

Body fat and blood pressure tests
are offered for students. All of this
comes at no charge to the students.

If the Lothrop Fitness Center is
not what your looking for, Trees

options. Trees Hall is equipped with
basketball and racquet ball courts,
two pools, dance studios and a
heavy duty weight lifting gym that
is accessible to all Pitt students,
faculty and staff. A valid Pitt ID is
required.

Trees Hall also offer several
aerobics classes, some of which are
acredited. Self defense classes are
available at no additional cost.

The indoor track located in the
Fitzgereld Fieldhouse, is open to
Pitt students, staff, and faculty at
the times it is not being used by Pitt
varsity athletes. The outdoor track
in the football stadium is also avail-
able to students.

And if that’s still not enough,
according to Ross,“‘The administra-
tion is looking at the possibility of
building another recreation center
on lower campus.”

A few things to keep the weekend allilele busy

Mqtt Grove

   

As the summer of 1996 comes to a close,
along with it comes the end of summer bas-
ketball leagues, Federation baseball and the
leisure of just getting out and exercising
your right of sport.

The free time that we all know and love
will soon be gone as classes begin. And
even before you know it, the weather will
return to its wonderful Pittsburgh, wintry
form. _

The chances of ﬁnding that pick—up game
or that great jogging trail will be lost until
April returns, but that doesn’t mean that
there isn’t anything for the weekend athlete
on campus. « . '

ic facilities for student use at the Fitzgerald

Men's soccer hopes to improve on its best season

    

Ned Schano
. ‘- ‘ -'    
,     

 

\

Can they do it again?

That is the question surrounding
this year’s men soccer team follow-
ing the most successful season in
school history. The Panthers finished
1995 with a 13-5 overall record,
including a 8-3 Big East record,
good for second place in the confer-
ence.

But despite last year’s triumphs,
1995 ended with a bitter defeat that
did not figure in the win-loss record.
The Panthers were snubbed by the
NCAA tournament selection com-

   
   
   
     
     
      
   
  
   

mittee, despite finishing the season
strongly with a second—place finish
in the Big East Tournament and a
national ranking.

Head Coach Joe Luxbacher did not
want to talk about the disappoint-
ment about not being selected.
Rather, he focused on the positives
about last year’s team.

“We never quit.” Luxbacher said,
praising his team’s work ethic and
attitude. “Everyone did their part; it
was just a great team effort.”

Unlike years past, the 1995 squad
did not rely on one or two players to
carry the load.

“[Last year] was one of those

occasion,” Luxbacher said. “We’ve
had as much talent as last year’s
team, but [last year] there was just a
good mix of players, players who
came up with big plays at big times.”

Bret Stezoski will be one of the
players that Luxbacher will rely on
this year. Stezoski, who started
every game for the Panthers, was
named captain for 1996, and other
co-captains will be named before the
season begins. In addition to
Stezoski, leading scorer Drew Kopp
returns to lead the Panther offense.
Kopp netted five goals and three
assists to lead the Panthers with 13

points in what was only his fresh-
man year. Fourth leading scorer
Keith Hoetzlein (seven points) and
fifth leading scorer Travis Kruse (six
points) also return to aid the offense.

The offense will be hurt by the
loss of three of their best scorers last
year. Todd Graf (who led the
Panthers with three game-winning
goals), Jeff Porter and J.L. Gorsin
will be missed. But the return of
senior forward Dean Astorino and
senior Mike Dyer from a broken leg
will help the team tremendously.

The Pitt defense will again be
strong this year, anchored by senior
goalie Adam Spitzer. Spitzer started
all 18 games and averaged a scant
1.04 goals against average. In addi-
tion to Stezoski, Pitt returns Matt
Schell and Steve Hopper to the
defensive corps.

Luxbacher hopes that mix of play-
ers can reach their preseason goal.

“Our goal is to get to the Big East
final. But to do that, you’ve got to go
step—by-step,” Luxbacher noted.
“My goal is to play as well as we
can. The players and coaches must
be able to go through the peaks and
valleys.” .

,Senior midfielder Matt Gray
believes the Panthers are poised for
another outstanding season. j

“As long as people come in with
the same attitude, we should be able
to do just as well this year if not bet-
ter,” Gray said. “We have a lot of
veterans coming back.”

“We got the shock and surprise out
of ourselves after going on a win-
ning streak,” Gray added. “We got
used to winning so we may as well
keep going with it.” P

But in order to do that, Pitt will
have to win in one of the top confer-
ences in the country. The Big East

will again be home to some of the’

nation’s top teams. St. Johns, com-
ing off a Big East Championship,
and Boston College, the regular—sea—
son champs, expect to be nationally-
ranked. ‘

With all the talent in the league,
Coach Luxbacher expects to be
ranked lower in the conference.

“I don’t know if other teams in the

Big East will give us the credit we .

earned last year,” Gray added. “But
that doesn’t matter, because we’re
going to have to go out and prove

ourselves again. We came in second '

[in the Big East] last year and we’ve
got to go for first this year. The
NCAA Tournament is our ultimate
goal.”

Luxbacher concluded his com-
ments by saying, “I like our team.
We have a good bunch of men this
year.”

Grove longs for days‘ of
backyard championships
and drug-free athletes

 
 

' e growing up, most kids who
played sports had dreams of
becoming the next Joe Montana,

Michael Jordan, or Cal Ripken. I can
remember the long nights in my driveway
shooting baskets with only :02 seconds left
on the clock and the ball in my hands. Of
course, if for some sickeningtwist of fate I
missed the shot, I had to have been fouled.

I would sink the shots and cheer to
myself because I had just won the champi-
onship, my charnpionship. _

The football games in my backyard
that came down to the ﬁnal long bomb, it’s
amazing how many of our games ended
with a defensive penalty that gave us just
one more shot at the endzone.

Those times have changed for me, but
they remain the same for kids growing up
today. Millions of kids have those same
dreams to make it big, but the professional
athletes today just don’t seem to be the

I ' same as they were only 10 years ago.

There are the aforementioned men
who still leave that wonderful feeling in the
hearts of sports fans around the world, but
there are too many now that I just can’t
understand. How can these athletes be so
stupid as to mess their lives up?

Mike Tyson, Michael Irvin, Bam
Monis.

These are just three of the countless
stars that have managed to nearly destroy
their careers.

Tyson went to prison for four long
years after being convicted of raping
Desiree Washington. No one but Tyson
and Washington will ever know what real-
ly happened, but the fact remains that
Tyson was convicted by a jury of his peers
and gave boxing, as well as himself a
vicious black eye.

Irvin and Morris are a little different.
These men went head over heels into a
world that nobody should mess around
witl1.— drugs.

If you own a television or pick up a
newspaper you couldn’t have missed the

deliberation in Irvin’s trial. The Playmaker _

didn’t mess around. He brought the works
— topless dancers and hookers. Pretty
smart move for a guy with a wife and new-
born daughter at home.

After a couple weeks of Irvin parading
around in a fur coat and dark glasses, he
agreed to a plea bargain. Basically, his.
name got him off, and his wife took him
back with open arms.

In January, Bam Morris was the lead-
ing rusher in Super Bowl XXX. Less than
two months after the Steelers loss to the
Cowboys, Morris was pulled over in his
home state of Texas. No, Morris wasn’t
speeding and it wasn’t a case of the trooper
wanting an autograph for his kid. Not even
close. This superstar just happened to have
ﬁve to six pounds of marijuana in his hunk.

After months of attempts to get his
friend to take the rap or ﬁgure another way
out of it, Morris was faced with a trial in
late June. He pulled out all the stops for this
one. His high school football coach and
principal testiﬁed in his behalf. They said
that Morris was always. a straight laced guy
who meant no harm. His coach at Texas
Tech even had a couple pleasant words to
say.

The best part was the fact that Morris’
lawyer claimed that Morris really had no
intention of distributing the marijuana, in
fact it was all just a misunderstanding in
which Morris was caught in the’ middle.
Sure, ﬁve pounds with no intent to distrib-
ute. O.K. Bam, we believe you.

I have a hunch that the ﬁve pounds of
dope that they found in Morris’ Mercedes
somehow found it’s way into the judge’s
chambers. First offense or lOOth olfense,
this guy deserved more than probation and
a ﬁne. The Steelers realized that Morris
wasn’t worth their time and money and
released him. Smart move, but what about
the Cowboys? , _

None of Irvin’s teammates would even
go to court and testify in his behalf, with the
exception of a late appearance by Troy
Aikrnan.

When the whole circus was ﬁnally
over, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he
was happy for Michael as a person as well
as a player. Emrrritt said that he was glad
that reporters would now be ofr" Irvin’s back
and get on with their lives. Yeah, poor Irvin
shouldn’t have received all that negative
attention for getting high with a couple of
topless dancers while his wife sat at home
with their daughter.

I just can’t begin to understand what
must go through the minds of these ath-
letes. What makes them think they are
above the law? How can they continue to
ruin their reputations and really make no
honest changes in their lifestyles?

The officialnot-so-official Piﬂ News Sports Glossary

For those of you with a love of all sports, an
unquenchable thirst to know more about sports, or a
desire to know a little something about sports, look no
further. Herein lies the ofﬁcial glossary of sports tenni-
nolgies, a guide with no equal. This is a must have for
any desk collection. However, due to space constraints,
it must be noted that this is only a small fraction of ter-
minologies that one will read throughout the year.

Football

draw play — An offensive play in which a quarterback
drops back as if to pass and then hands of to a running
back who attempts running straight

ahead. fiﬁﬁlﬂisb
ﬁeld goal — A score of three  ’
points made when kicking the ball

through the goalposts over the

"crossbar from scrimmage.

fumble — The accidental loss of control or possession
of the ball when handling or running with it.

holding — To grab or use the hands or arms to restrict
the movement of an opponent.

interception — The act or an instance of intercepting a
pass.

offsides — Being over or having any part of the body
beyond the scrimmage line on a scrimmage down or
beyond the restraining line on a kick down the moment
the ball is put into play.

onsides kick —— A kickoff in which the ball travels for-
ward just far enough to be legally recoverable (10 yards
or 9.144 meters for any foreigners) by the kicking team.
pass interference — Illegal interference with the oppo-
nent’s attempt to catch a forward pass.

personal foul — A foul that constitutes dangerous and
unsportsmanlike (ofﬁcially the longest word ever used

“There is a time in every man’s education
when he arrives at the conviction that envy is
ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must
take himself for better or for worse as his por-
tion; that though the wide universe is full of
good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to
him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of
ground which is given to him to till.”

I’ve only been at the University of Pittsburgh
for a year, but that ﬁrst year has taught me an
important lesson: that, like Emerson said’ in the
above passage, you get what you’ve worked for.
In the past year, I have been able to take advan-
tage of many opportunities that I’m convinced
don’t exist in other colleges and universities, so
(at the risk of sounding like an Oiﬁce of
Admissions employee) I am truly glad that I
chose Pitt. A college education should, after all,
force you not only to complete the allegorical
obstacle course, but to resign it, to challenge its
existence, to question its utility, and to emerge at
the end of this process with the ability to think
clearly, apply your thoughts to your decisions,
and take responsibility for those decisions. The
University of Pittsburgh does this for me, and
here, in my humble opinion, is why:

By choosing to attend Pitt, you have chosen
to attend not only an academically solid institu-
tion, but one that has unique surroundings, and
one that has recently acquired new leadership-
all of which puts you in a position to get a real-
ly, really good education. BUT (and this is an
important But) the really good education part
will only happen if you work for it.

I’ve said that Pitt has unique surroundings (by
this I mean the city of Pittsburgh), but this is not
entirely true. Unlike many other colleges and
universities, Pitt is neither isolated from nor sur-
rounded by the city. but rather is a part of it. Not

- only does this lead to more opportunities for

students, but it makes us part of a larger tradi-
tion—the tradition of hard work made in the
city. Pittsburgh was built by the coal and steel
industries in the last century and owes most of
its public facilities to the men who were in con-
trol of those industries — Carnegie, Frick, and
Mellon to name a few. H.J. Heinz, whose
ketchup graces burgers around the world, start-
ed out selling horseradish sauce in Pittsburgh,
but built his company so that they were able to
sell even more than the fabled 57 Varieties.

Theodore Roosevelt, speaking to the Chamber .

of Commerce in the early part of the century,
noted, “There is no more typical American city
than Pittsburgh  your tremendous concerns
were built by men who actually did the work 
there is not a Pittsburgh man who did not earn
his success through his deeds.”

The University of Pittsburgh draws on this
tradition to oﬂ’er its students and outstanding

institution. Over the past 200 years, as anyone
who ever took a tour knows, it grew from a
“tiny log cabin to the large university it is
today.”

What it offers today, though, is pretty irnpres—
sive. Pitt’s philosophy department is ranked sec-
ond in the United States. The University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center, study abroad pro-
gram, and undergraduate college of business are
some of the best programs of their kind nation-
wide. Pitt is the alma mater of August Wﬂson,
Dan Marino, John Woodruff, Loren Maazel,
Gene Kelly, and even, I think that guy that sells
T-shirts at the comer of Forbes and Bigelow.
You can study just about anything you want to
study here, and if you work hard, your teachers
will open more opportunities for you. All of
these things will help you immensely if you put
forth the effort.

The third factor in Pitt’s effectiveness is that
we have a new chancellor, who, it is hoped, will
clean up the bureaucratic mess that has plagued
every undergraduate who has attempted to reg-
ister in Thackeray Hall for decades. He is well-
respected throughout the University and is
known as someone who really listens to what
people have to say. Perhaps most importantly
though, he is someone who works hard at what
he does — he has risen through the ranks at Pitt,
going ﬁom professor to interim provost, to dean
of the law school (and collected a Chancellor’s
Distinguished Teaching Award along the way).
Chancellor Nordenberg, if anyone, will be the
person to remake Pitt’s image and to bring the
University into the next millennium as a strong
and valued institution of higher learning (enter
fanfare of trumpets). .

So that’s all folks — now is the time to make
the most of your education, by working hard.
And there’s no better place to start than right
here at Pitt. ,

 

Everyone knows that to get through college
— to get your degree — you must choose a
major. A major is an academic discipline, that
through various vagaries of history and human
perversity, have become THE ﬁelds in which
one can choose to study. But there are other
ways; ways to ﬁnd out new and interesting
things. '

To be Un—disciplined is, in the jargon of the
academic trade, to be inter—disciplinary. A few
years ago, CAS initiated a new major called
interdisciplinary — which means you can put
together a package of topics and courses that
makes sense to an approval board, and count
that as your major. Never mind right now why
you might really want to do that. I’ll get to that
later. Also there still exists the older option of
a independent studies major. Again you must
make a case why your self-designed program
makes sense before you can pursue it.

But the big question is why interdiscipli-
nary, and what is it? Say, to pick a bizarre
example, you have a passion for 17th Century
French history. Sure, you need to know about
the politics, the government, but what about
the science, philosophy, art, music, and the
cooking of that time? These all ﬁt together, and
no one discipline teaches all these aspects, so
you need to check out courses in other depart-
ments. Or your interest may be ﬁlm, so you
have Film Studies which itself is interdiscipli-
nary, but can you know about ﬁlm without
knowing about music that makes the back-
ground, about the physics that makes the
images, about the psychology that detemrines
their audience responses? Again, no single
department treats all these aspects.

The point is that to learn about anything,
you need to both be tightly concentrated and,
at the same time, broadly based. As an under-
graduate you ought to use your time to explore
both paths. One technique is to get a course
schedule, and by yourself or with some
friends, go through it. Mark the things that
interest you — titles that sound intriguing.
Thentry to group them into some coherent set.

Take courses in different departments that
somehow ﬁt together. A chemistry course, an
ecology course, a biology course, and social
policy course all make ecological problems
more understandable and give different, alter-
native perspectives. The courses reinforce one
another — you can use what you learn in one
course in the others.

So, why am I writing about interdisciplinary
studies? The reason is that I am a member of
an interdisciplinary department — History and
Philosophy of Science.

It is nothing you have heard of in your high
schools. But it makes sense. You may wish to
look at some of our courses — they can even
help you to make Einstein make sense. But
more importantly, the reason I am telling you
all this about looking around and exploring
many paths, is that I could never ﬁgure out
what I wanted to be when I grew up! Sol stud-
ied mathematics, art history, psychology, soci-
ology, history. literature, and philosophy; now
I am into statistics, neurobiology, ﬁlm, and
computers. I still don’t know what I want to
become. But I am having a very good time ﬁg-
uring out how things work. Maybe you are just
a bit like me?

Maybe you too might enjoy such intellectu-
al wanderings. The University is a great place,
with many resources, and many possibilities
for you to explore. Take advantage. Find out
who is good. take courses from them — no
matter what you think your interests might be.

There is one other aspect that I want to men-
tion. Talk to your professors. Ask them ques-
tions in class. Go to see them in their offices.
Believe it or not, they want to see you. and to
get to know you. Well, not really — professors
like other humans run the gamut from the open
and approachable to those who are shy and
reclusive — the good, the bad and the ugly.
But you won't know who is which until you
approach them. Most of us came to universi-
ties to try to make difference in our students’
lives. Sometimes, even today, it still happens.
There is no better reward for a professor than
to have a student, who graduated ﬁve years
ago, come back and say, “I remember you,
your course; it really changed my life.” The
real test is not the exam you take after the
course, but what you recall ﬁve years after
leaving the University.

Sorrowfully, the burden is on you. In reality,
there is no teaching, only learning. Only you,
for yourself, can leam —- we can just put out.

WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT
(NOT THE HOKEY POKEY)

Welcome to The Pitt News. This fall begins
with changes in the university and the paper. One
thing which has not changed, however, is the
paper’s role on this campus. -

This goal of this year’s editorial board for The
Pitt News is to be a reliable source of information

that the Pitt community can use. This information .

will span all areas of interest: news, sports, enter-
tainment, and opinions. .

While the paper works for the students and the
rest of the University, it is students who work for
the paper. We are always in need of motivated,
competent people who have an interest in jour-
nalism. Writing for the paper is as easy as con-
tacting a section editor about a story assignment.
The telephone numbers for each section are listed
on the Pitt Views page.

If you want to remain solely in the realm of
the reader, but feel the need to respond to some-
thing that was printed, send us a letter to the edi-
tor, care of the Opinions section editor.. Please
include a phone number, so that we can verify the
letter. 4
While on the subject of readers’ criticisms of
The Pitt News, there are a couple of pointsthat
ought to be made clear. The ﬁrst is that The Pitt
News receives no money from the student activi-
ties fee or the University of Pittsburgh. We are an
independent publication. that receives all of its
funding through advertising revenue. The other
point is that the student editors have final control
over what is printed in the paper. The Pitt News is
not an organ of the administration. If something
seems terribly wrong with the paper, it is up to the
editors to fix it, so please bring it to our attention.

A word about the opinions page is in order‘ at
this point as well. Letters, columns, and cartoons
reﬂect the opinions of their respective authors.
They do not represent the opinion of The Pitt
News. The unsigned editorial represents the opin-
ion of the majority of the editorial board. There’
may be unanimous agreement, or there may be a
bitter division. No one editor, however, is to
blame for the entire piece.

Finally, if a number of columns or letter on
both sides of an issue are received, an effort‘ will
be made toprovide a comprehensive view of both
sides of the argument. Every attempt will be made
to let both sides have their say without redundan-
cy redundancy. '

It has been said that newspapers are the rough
draft of history. We hope that when this rough
draft is examined by posterity that it will be found
to be accurate and enjoyable. More importantly,
however, we hope that when this generation looks
at it, we hope they find the information that will
help them make history. ' '

A THE PITT NEWS

We need ca lake...

We, the students of the University of 3
Pittsburgh, deserve the best recreation-
al facilities that the school has within 
its means to offer. Why, then is there 
no crew team? E

The only answer could be that 
Oakland doesn’t have enough lakes. :

How can this university, the cradle 
of our destiny, the crucible of our E
dreams, possibly hope to compete? There aren’t enough
lakes! How can this university, the Harvard of the West,
hope to attract and retain students? There aren’t enough
lakes! How can this university, discovering the present and
transforming the future, hope to discover anything at all?
There aren’t enough lakes!

We, the students of the University of Pittsburgh, demand
that something be done about this.

Panther Hollow is nothing but an eyesore, anyway. But
with a minimum of expense, the city could re-route the
Monongahela River. Panther. Hollow could be ﬂooded to
create a wonderland of death and beauty for us.

This is our due.

Fellow students, the time has come for action. Break
out your writing skills. Write the mayor. Write the new
chancellor. Make your voice known. The old Mon River
needs to be rerouted — NOW! Oakland needs to be ﬂood-
ed — NOW! We want what we want — NOW!

Sincerely,

...but no homosexuals?

In the ﬁnal edition for the summer (July
17) an individual pretended that heterosex-
3 ual and homosexual marriages are equal in
value and should be treated as such.

Once again someone points to the “found-
ing principals” of our country as support-
ing the sexual and marital perversions of
our time. It is quite clear, to anyone who
takes the time to look, that most of this
country’s founders were unreservedly religious. While their
morals were not codiﬁed in the Constitution, there are suffi-
cient references to “God” to shoot down the stupid argument
that politics and religion are to be kept separate (can we say

“Communist Manifesto”?). As in most things, there are
extremes to be avoided, which is what the American
Revolution was all about. But, to the surprise of many, our
government is based on the principal of “self-govemment”,
not “individual freedoms”. One presupposes a citizemy that is
sufﬁciently moral to practice self-restraint in the pursuit of
happiness and the protection of certain freedoms, the other
panders to the most decadent aspects of human nature.
Freedoms are a function of self-govemment, not the reverse.

And let’s clarify the issue here: we are not talking about pro-

g tection but rather “privileges”; another attempt to obtain oﬁi-

cial sanction of an immoral and unhealthy lifestyle, one in
which this nation is paying a heavy price. Congress would do
well to rely on the heritage of our forefathers in summarily dis-
missing any bills which weaken what few morals and ethics

we still hold. ’

Let’s establish something from the
outset.

If you’re here thinking about simply
putting in four years (or ﬁve, or six, or
whatever) here at the University of
Pittsburgh, expecting to walk down that
aisle at the Civic Arena and right into a
high—paying, high-status job, you’re in
the wrong place for the wrong reason.

I should know. I learned the hard way.

You see, I’m a senior here at Pitt. That
may not sound too unusual on the sur-
face - except that my junior year began
in the fall of 1982.

So why did it take me so long to get to
this point? Well, let me put it to you this
way: I fell for the charms of one
Beaucoup Bucks.

When I was coming out of
Wilkinsburg High School, from which I
graduated in 1979, blacks with brains
were encouraged to consider engineer-
ing as a career and take side courses in
business administration - the reward
being, of course, Beaucoup Bucks Nice
work if you can get it, and my father
wanted me to. Bad.

I remember when I was ﬁlling out my
SAT questionnaire (well, actually, Dad
was telling me what to put down) during
my junior year. When it came down to
“ultimate career goals,” he told me to

THE, PITT NEVVS

Eclucalion shouldn't st be abou earnn Beaucoup Bucks

put down “Industrial Management.”

Industrial Management?! ?

Years later I learned why.

You see, at that time my education,
and subsequently my life, was supposed
to be about gaining power, prestige, and
perks - the spirit of Beaucoup Bucks.
You know, the high-ﬁve-ﬁgure salary, a
big, comfortable house in an exclusive
suburb, a Cadillac (or Mercedes or
Lexus, depending on your tastes)
equipped with the obligatory cellular
phone, the power lunches, the golf out-
ings, the country clubs, the rr1illion-dol-
lar deals. I was supposed to advance and
make people proud of me, that I was
“somebody.”

There were two major problems: One,
that kind of lifestyle has never appealed
to me anyway, so getting all those things
weren’t, and still aren’t, sufﬁcient moti-
vation for me to excel. Two, I wasn’t
much good at science and higher math.

As a result, I lasted one year at
Georgia Tech.

I came to Pitt in 1980, majoring in
chemistry and believing that Tech was
just too difﬁcult. The result, however,
was much the same —— only it took three
years to get kicked out. ‘

No Beaucoup Bucks for me, at least
not in that area.’

After some serious soul-searching, not
to. mention domestic upheavals (both my
mother and I moved out in late summer

1983), I decided I probably had more
talent in journalism. I always did write,
and people who knew me growing up
told me I had talent, but you know how
it is — can you make a living doing
that? (If I had been told way back when
that I could, I’d have gone after a writing
career with both barrels.) As it was, I
eventually switched my major to media
communications and have since gone
from academic casualty to the Dean’s
List. ‘

But there’s another reason why simply
going after Beaucoup Bucks won’t cut it
these days — it’s not as easy to do.

Can you say “corporate downsizing?”

Well, guess what. The supply of high-
paying managerial jobs much of my
generation had counted on have been
drying up for about 10 years now, and
the MBA degrees we were told to spur-
sue are" these days barely worth the
paper they’re printed on. Years ago,
when I worked at a Giant Eagle, I recall
a number of -well—dr'essed, professional-
looking customers who paid for their
groceries with food stamps!

Not only that, I remember a story a
couple years ago in The Pitt News about
a recent Pitt alumna who was frustrated
because_she unrealistically expected “a
job with a title” upon graduation. Was
she looking to use her skills in a con-
structive way?

I don’t think so. She just wanted

 

I . , ,M°nd¢v.t,.AI,I.s,I"*. 15:. 1:996, 1;.

Beaucoup Bucks.

So what’s the solution? Well, while at
work I came across this book called “Do
What You Love, The Money Will
Follow.’’ Now, I haven’t actually read it,
but the title makes‘ sense, because if you
enjoy what you’re doing, chances are
that you will do higher—quality work and
people will pay for it. That’s why I’m in
journalism —- I like it and I’m good at it.

On the other hand, if you see people
coming home from work looking
drained complaining about superiors or
subordinates, chances are that they hate
what tl1ey’re doing. I sometimes won-
der: If I had made it in engineering,
would I have wanted to go to work every
day? Maybe not necessarily.

Anyway, now that you’re here, take
courses in whatever interests you. It
could be anthropology, classics, or reli-
gious studies. And if you really enjoy
medicine, business, or, computers, who
am I to tell you not to pursue those
ﬁelds?

All I’m saying is that if you simply
follow the lead of Beaucoup Bucks,
you’ll make yourself very unhappy.

Not only that - if you don ’t make it,
you’ll be considered a failure. And who
wants that? -

At your ﬁrst class meeting, instruc-
tors provide name, ofﬁce number, and
ofﬁce hours. The University requires
everyone from teaching assistants "to
full professors to keep regular hours.
Be sure to get the name, place, and time
— secretaries can’t identify the tall,
skinny guy with glasses. Talk to these
persons, and get to know what they
think and do outside of the classroom.

I ask students to stop by for a half-
hour conversation during the ﬁrst two
weeks, but some instructors think,
“They are grown-ups; they should
know to come on their own.” We may
talk about everything but Shakespeare
(my current undergraduate class); I am
also interested in Woodie Allen movies,
old cars, and Gustav Mahler sym-
phonies. I ask about students’ interests
since ancillary knowledge may prove
fruitful in class discussion: “Tell us
about heraldry, Mr. Jones!”

A university is “a community of
scholars.” If we are a community, we
have to talk; if we are scholars, then we
have something to talk about. With me,
it is Shakespeare and 19th century
British writers. When Thomas
Jefferson planned the University of
Virginia, he wrote no word about class-
es or lectures. He created an academic
village for professors and students to

A where they can pour

THE PI'I"l' NEWS

live together and study. Talking is bet-
ter.than lecturing.

A university exists to ﬁnd ways to
use information. Hillman Library has
four million volumes, and data banks
provide more. We ﬁnd out how to use
information by watching experts,
working with them, and talking. Every
faculty member has written articles,
published books, talked at conferences.
We teach classes and
try to advance human
knowledge and under-
standing.

I envy instructors in
the natural sciences
who have laboratories

interesting liquids into
beakers or look at spi-
der legs under a
microscope. In some
natural science facili-
ties, students can
work in laboratories.
Such work is good
experience which
enriches your life
when you graduate. I like being able to
tell students where to get more infor-
mation and having them come back and
teach me. My favorite undergraduate
teacher was boring in class, but I
walked out of his office with new ideas
zinging in my head and consciousness
of my own failures and lack of experi-

ence. We had great talks, even though
he called me Mr. Tobias and I called
him Mr. Derby.

You avoided teachers in high school
9 except for athletic coaches, band
directors, and drama types. I would as
soon have eaten meat with e. coli on it.
Someone would accuse me of brown-
nosing or being a teacher’s pet. Not
here. We are not enemies or blocks to
your happiness.
We are co-students
helping to create
the next generation
of citizens,

Since we are cre-
ative humans with
different ways to
meet human difﬁ—
culties, another
perspective helps
you and the subject
you are trying to
understand.

When I was a
student, I arrived at
the instructor’s
office on the half hour. If I didn’t know
how to get out, I could jump up and say,
“I have a class; my parking meter is
running out; my girlfriend needs my
hankie.” Escape clauses are good expe-
dients. On the other hand, watch your
clock, and don’t overstay the time.
Instructors too may have to go to class

thinkers, scholars. ‘

Monday, August 26, I996

6 IC hour chats can enlighten both students and faculty

or get a drink of water. Don’t talk
before class because we need silence
for ﬁve minutes to collect books, notes,
and mind. Things are usually too har-
ried after class. Stop in the ofﬁce.

It doesn’t hurt to schedule ahead, but

you can always appear during the.

announced hours. If it is an English
writing class, bring the last paper.
Don’t wait until you get an F. Coming
with a bitch (even if you have one)
doesn’t encourage easy -talk. Ask ques-
tions, and have a good time.

Students complain, “They [profes-
sors] are never there.” If I have been
keeping my hours for six weeks and no
one shows up, I am tempted to get a
cup of coffee, use the Xerox, or talk to
a colleague during my hours. Look
around. Then ask the secretaries. They
love to get back at faculty with, ~“Mr.
Jones was here to see you, but he
couldn’t ﬁnd you.” You can make their
day. You can also enforce discipline
among faculty who are supposed to be
there to help you.

This is not a big, impersonal univer-
sity—unless you make it one. A

And if you ﬁnd yourself behind, out
of touch, or losing it, get to the office to
talk. Do not just stop attending class.
Talk. We can help.

English and a guest columnist for The
Pitt News.

(Editor's Note: The following shows
how The Pitt News college football experts
see the I 996 Big East season. )

1. Syracuse Orangemen (11-0, 7-0)

The 1995 version of the Syracuse
Orangemen was one of the most successful
in recent memory. The ‘Cuse, led by speedy
receiver Marvin Hanison, ﬁnished their 9-3
season with an impressive 41-0 trouncing of
Clemson in the Toyota Gator Bowl.
Harrison is one of only seven starters that
head coach Paul Pasqualoni lost from last

season.

ms pun news . _ T .

The 10th ranked Orangemen will be led
by sophomore QB Donovan McNabb.
While the All—American candidate McNabb
isn’t dabbling around as a super sub on the

Syracuse hoops team, he is looking to‘

improve on some impressive numbers from
last year. In ‘95, McNabb threw for 1,991
yards and 16 TDs.

Joining McNabb in the backﬁeld will
be tailback Malcolm Thomas (124 rushes,
609 yards) and big fullback Rob Konrad (63
rushes, 433 yards).

On defense the Orangemen lost only
three starters and wel me back All-

Temple’s Henry Burris could emerge as one of the Big East's premier signal
callers this season. In 1994, Burris was second-team All Big East. ‘

The Pitt News’ sure-fire Big Ea predictions

American candidate DB Kevin Abrams.
Linebacker Nate Helrnsley (86 solo tackles,
119 total, 3 1/2 sacks) is also back to anchor
the middle. Free safety Donovin Darius (79
solo, 131 total tackles, 2 INT) is also retum-
ing to a solid Syracuse defense.

Sean Reali, the Orangemen’s third All—_

American candidate, will handle the kicking
duties for Syracuse. -
m. grove

2. Virginia Tech Hokies (10-1, 6-1)

For the ﬁrst time in the history of the
Big East Conference, someone else besides
the Miami Hurricanes will attempt to
defend the conference championship. The
Virginia Tech Hokies take the honors after
coming off a top 10 season and a Sugar
Bowl victory.

The biggest reason for Hokie optimism
is Cornell Brown. The brother of former
Panther great Rueben returns after winning
last season’s Big East Defensive Player of
the Year. Brown is a dominant force who
registered 17 quarterback sacks along with
an additional 11 tackles for losses. Expect
him to contend for several awards at the end

Druckenrniller (2,103 yards, 14 TDs)
returns as the starter. Tech did lose its top
two receivers, Jennaine Holmes and Sugar
Bowl MVP Bryan Still, so Druckenmiller
will look towards Cornelius White (22
catches, 312 yards) to pick up the slack.
Despite the loss of starting tailback
Dwayne Thomas, Tech still has Ken
Oxendine. Oxendine rushed for 693 yards
and four touchdowns in limited duty last
season. '

ry. Lack of experience or not, this defen-
sive unit does have the talent.

Chavis does not see the overall lack
of experience as a problem and promises
that this year’s unit will gel as long as all
the players understand their assign-
ments.

Chavis’ assignments differ greatly
this year from previous seasons. As a
linebacker, Chavis was relied on to stuff
the opponents running back and often
drop back into zone coverage.

This season, Chavis will rely more
on pass rushing, a new facet to his game.
Through his first three years, Chavis tal-
lied one—and-a-half sacks and two tack-
les for losses.

“My role is to go out there, have fun
and put pressure on the quarterback,”
Chavis said. “Even if I can just open
things up for other defenders, I’m doing
my job. But I’ll still be dropping back
into zone coverages a lot.”

Chavis is looking forward to playing
this year’s home opener against Pitt’s
biggest remaining rival — West Virginia.

“'I'hat’s all I’ve been thinking about,”
Chavis said. “My good friend, Mike
Logan, plays corner for them and we’ve
been talking trash for four years but for
some reason or another, we’ve never
played against each other. This will be
the ﬁrst time we’ll be on the ﬁeld togeth-
er. So it will have extra special meaning,

It’s refreshing to see that kind of
intensity again around Panther camp, the
renewal of rivalries that were formally
considered to be among the best in the
nation. ’

Chavis, who dreamed of attending
Pitt since childhood, grew up hating
Penn State and Joe Paterno. After this
season and graduation, he hopes to enter
the NFL, preferably playing for Bill
Cowher and his beloved Pittsburgh
Steelers, he’s really willing to play any-
where.

But if that career does not develop,

uncle, Ron “Nighttime Dog” Chavis, has

been a Pittsburgh radio personality for —

years.

Right now, however, Chavis is strict-
ly concentrating on the season ahead of
him and he knows exactly what Pitt has
to do to improve themselves and search
for that elusive bowl berth.

“The key is we have to win all our
home games,” Chavis said. “If we do
that, get some conﬁdence, learn how to
win, and maybe take a couple on the
road; my dream will be realized —— play-
ing in a bowl game for the University of
Pittsburgh.” 0

(Editor’s Note: the following is a personal
account of Pitt ’s storied football program.)

Will somebody please tell me why a
sports fan’s memory is so incredible when
it comes to trivia like how many times has
Pitt been in the NCAA basketball touma—
ment (eleven) and have such a Swiss
cheese memory when it comes to remem-
bering anything beyond your team’s last
season?

Look at Pitt football. I’m not going to
deny that last season was a disappoint-
ment. But, I’m not going to sit back and
listen to everyone tell me that our team is
so bad we should be embarrassed to show
our faces come August 31, when the
Mountaineers come down off the hills and
run around in their ratty ‘coonskin caps.

How can we be embarrassed about a
team that has nine national championships
under it’s belt, placing us sixth in the his-
tory of the NCAA?

We have a team here that needs our
support. They aren’t the poor step children
that our rivals make them out to be. This is
a program that has produced 82 ﬁrst—team
All-Americans and ranks sixth in Division
1-A schools with 46 consensus All-
Americans.

The same program that boasts over

THE PITT NEWS‘ .

Takea stroll down Pitt fooalls memory lane

200 former panthers playing in the NFL
and 11 former coaches, including Jimmy
Johnson and Dave Wannstedt.

That sorry program that has pushed
it’s players to win the Heisman Trophy
(Tony Dorsett), the Maxwell Award (Hugh
Green), the Walter Camp Award (Mark
Stepnoski), the Outland Trophy (Mark
May), and the Lombardi Trophy (Green).

The same pitiful program that has
seen 16 men associated with it ( e.g. Mike
Ditka, Joe Schmidt, Marshall Goldberg)
elected to the College Football Hall of
Fame.

There are only 17 schools out there
with more career victories than the
University of Pittsburgh’s 566.

We have a coach, Johnny Majors,
who has been in college football for 28
years and ﬁnished second in the 1956
Heisman balloting. In a profession where
longevity is tough to come by, there are
only four active coaches who have
coached more games than Majors.

He is ranked 23rd in the all—tirne
Division 1-A coaching category with 181
career victories. He has recruited 23 All-
Americans and coached a total of 23 num-
ber—one NFL draft picks.

Every team that Majors has inherited
has gone on to new-found success; from_
taking Iowa State to it’s ﬁrst ever bowl
games, to turning around a 1-10 Pittsburgh
in 1972 into a the 1976 national champi-

ul/ill]. UP YOUR SUNDAY.

on.

Majors has been national Coach of '
the Year twice (‘73 and ‘76), Big Eight
Coach of the Year (‘71), and SEC Coach
of the Year (‘85).

The team we have returning this year
is one of the most talented Pitt has ﬁelded
in a long time. With four returning All-
Star candidates, including Billy West and
Jason Chavis, who both missed most, or
all, of the ‘95 season due to injuries.

West has added 10 pounds to his
frame and has shaved and 2 seconds oﬂ’
his time in the 40., This makes him an

even more formidable weapon than he
was last season, when he had 31 carries
for 141 yards in just two games.

The University of Pittsburgh has been
playing football for 106 years. The team
has had it’s ups and downs, but by no
means do they deserve the raw treatment
they are receiving. This is a team to be
proud of and there is plenty of room on
the bandwagon.

Just something to remember when
our redneck visitors are here to open the
season with a bang, and not from that
damn popgun the rednecks carry either.

you are, I’m sony), several of you came to
Pitt to live out a childhood dream of fol-
lowing Pitt football and basketball.

Dreams often evolve into ghastly
nightmares.

There is a glimmer of hope for Pitt’s
pigskin waniors, it lies in the home sched-
ule. Let’s say Pitt wins it’s ﬁrst three games,
at home against West Virginia, Kent, and
Houston, a bowl game is not out of the
question.

There is a chance this team could go 7-
4, depending on how they fare with a killer
road schedule that includes  Ohio
State, and Notre Dame.

But, if last year was any indication,
don’t get excited too early.

However, the Panthers failed to win

Pitt has won 10 games each of the last
two seasons, despite last year’s top ﬁve
recruiting class. During the olfseason, Pitt
lost out on two high school stallions, lost
assistant coach Sean Miller, lost swingman
Michael Gill and managed to land only
two recruits.

The anguish the caring student body
has felt over these teams is tremendous, but
one can always take in a soccer game or go
see the women’s volleyball team perform.
It doens’t cost a penny to see them and,
lately, they’ve been all Pitt’s had to olfer.

Moms (4 games if he ﬁnds a team) will
have some time olf to think about what
they did, perhaps. Or maybe they’ll pitch in
and score some hits while they watch the
players that are trying to clean up the sport
that these two, along with many others,
have done a great job at destroying.

I think that the days are numbered for
some pro athletes that have dug themselves
into holes too deep to crawl out of. But I
hate to think that there are kids that aren’t
going to have that chance to sink the win-
ning shot or catch the hail maiy because
other players before them had dreams of
getting high and destroying their careers.

watching to see what they’re doing and
when they come back I help them. It’s not
like I want them to do badly,” Lytle said. “I
can learn from them when they do some-
thing right or when they make a mistake.”
With the words “quarterback controver-
sy” ﬂoating around camp, outsiders would
tend to believe that these men would stop at
nothing to get their shot, even if it meant

moving away from the camaraderie of the

team. In Lytle’s case, that is far from the
truth.

“Oﬂ° the ﬁeld there is no talk about
who’s the starter and stuﬂ° like that,” Lytle
said “ActuaHy, off the ﬁeld, there isn’t much
talk about football. We’re just trying to relax,
have fun, and kick back a little bit”

VVrth three solid quarterbacks able to
play, the possibility is there for the Panthers
to utilize 100 percent of their resources and
try some different strategies at quarterback.
A Matt Lytle deep route followed by a Pete
Gonzalez option play, and ﬁnally a Darnell
Dinkins QB keeper.

Lytle said, “I think that during the sea-
son, and we’ve been told this: that once there
is a starter named then he’s going to stay in
the game for the whole season.”

Lytle deﬁnitely has experience leading
a team as the starting quarterback. As a
three-year starter in high school, Lyﬂe led
Wyornissing to a 30-5-1 record and two
PIAA District HI Football Championships.
During his senior season, Lytle threw for
1,187 yards and was named second team

team and was also a Blue Chip Illustrated
second-team All-American.

While the plaques still hang on the wall
and newspaper clippings have made their
way to the scrapbook, Lytle must wony
about now and the task of being the starting
quarterback for a team that has struggled in
recent years. The schedule that awaits Pitt is
no help either. I

Away from the conﬁnes of newly reno-
vated Pitt Stadium, the Panthers face a hor-
riﬁc road schedule that consists of ﬁve Top
25 teams: Ohio State,  Syracuse,
Virginia Tech and ﬁnally Notre Dame.

“I think this is the hardest schedule in
the nation, at least the toughest away oppo-
nents anybody has,” Lytle said. “But I don’t
think any guys on the team are worried
about it. All we’re worried about now is
having a good camp and looking forward to

 

West Virginia.” -

The task of bringing the Panthers back
to respectability is going to be a pressure sit-
uation for whoever the starter may be, but
Karcher feels that Lytle can handle it.

“I think pressure is self-applied and
that’s what I try to teach them, the only pres-
sure they have to deal with is their own,”
Karcher said. “It’s not what other people say
about them, it’s what the other players and
coaches do and say. I think Matt will be able
to deal with that.”

After a nine game losing streak ended
the miserable season for the Panthers; they
are in desperate need ofa win.

“We’ll take it one game at a time and
hopefully if we do that and keep piling up
wins the conﬁdence level will be up,” Lytle
said. “We can go in and knock off some of
those bigger teams.”

It’s 6 p.m. on Wednesday. You’ve spent
a week trying to write a great first paper
to impress your history professor, and
ﬁnally you’ve produced eight pages of
first-rate material. But it’s written in your
typical illegible scrawl, and every other
line is crossed out.

It’s 11 a.m. on Monday. You’ve just left
your first calculus class, and you have a
week to complete the first set of prob-
lems, . which involve something called
“Mathematica” that you’ve never heard
of before.

It’s midnight on Thursday. You just had
a big fight with your current love interest,
and you have to teH your best friend from
high school right now. But you can’t
afford the long-distance phone call, and
who knows if she’s home anyway.

In each of these cases, you want to
head to the same place —— a campus com-
puter lab.

Computing and Information Services

‘ (CIS) operates labs in a number of key

buildings around campus: the Cathedral
of Learning, Hillman Library, Forbes
Quad, David Lawrence Hall, Benedum
Hall, and Sutherland Hall. Most of these
labs contain both DOS/Wmdows com-
puters and Macintosh computers, except-

 
   

p"_li_'l-IE,‘ pix: NEWS

ing Forbes Quad (DOS/Wmdows only)
and Lawrence (Mac only); the Benedum
and Sutherland labs are frequently open
24 hours a day.

Before you use the Pitt computer net-
work, you need your own network
account. If you didn’t have yours activat-
ed during your advising session, the pro-
cedure is quick and easy. Just head to the
Cathedral lab (ground
ﬂoor) or the Hillman
lab (first ﬂoor) and
tell the lab consultant
that you need to acti-
vate your account.

.Most students use the CIS labs for sim-

machines and Macs, you’ve got the
choice of WordPerfect or Microsoft
Word. Both programs are simple to use,

and they are about equal in ﬂexibility.‘

Don’t bother to use a non—Wmdows DOS
word processor —— unlike Windows and

screen and prints out a paper that looks
quite different. '

Yes, you can be on friendly terms with computers

the computer system for homework.
Your professor will tell you if the soft-
ware you need is only found on a partic-
ular type of computer; no matter which
type it’s on, when you log on to the sys-
tem you’ll find a menu folder called
“Course Software.” Clicking on this
folder will lead you to software such as
Mathematica (for calculus problems) or
Smithtown (for eco-
., nomics simulations).
i Increasingly,
students are using the
CIS labs to access the
Internet, both for acad-
emic and recreational
purposes. Electronic
' mail (e-mail) is the
’ quickest and easiest
a? way to communicate
with someone at Pitt, at another universi-
ty, or, these days, at almost any other
place in the technologically developed
world. Just click on the menu folder
called “Intemet Tools,” select the pro-
gram called “Telnet,” and follow the
prompts to log on to the UNIXS time-
sharing service. Once you’re at the
UNIXS screen, type “pine” to enter the e-
mail program.

The World Vlfide Web is also easy to
access from the lab computers. Click on
the “Intemet Tools” folder, then choose

 

_..A"‘5

“Netscape.” The Netscape Web browser
will come up to the Pitt introductory Web
page, and from there you can ﬁnd links
both to school information and general
Web directories, which will lead you to
whatever sort of information you’re
looking for. ~

In addition to DOS/Wmdows comput-
ers and Macintoshes, some of the labs
have workstations which are permanent-
ly linked to the UNIXS service. These
machines are usually the quickest if you
just want to use e-mail or Netscape, and
you won’t be in the way of someone who
needs to use word processing or course
software. Don’t be afraid to sit down at a
workstation just because it’s different
from the PCs you’re used to — a lab con-
sultant can show you how it works in less
than three minutes.

Most importantly, take advantage of
the resources which are available. If you
don’t know how to do something, ask the
lab consultants; that’s why they’re there.
If all of the consultants are busy, ask the
person sitting next to you. Pick up the
instructional documents that are in all of
the labs and read through them to see
what sorts of services CIS offers and how
to use them. But you’re going to spend a
respectable portion of the next four years
in the computer labs -— so get comfort-
able with them now.

It takes everyone on this campus
working together in order to make it a
safe place, according to Sgt. Charlie
Grier of the Pitt Police.

“Public safety is everybody’s
responsibility,” said Grier. “If we all
work together, we can make this cam-
pus a safe place.”

There are a number of groups work-
ing hard already to do just that.

The Pitt Police, at the request’ of
University and student organizations,
regularly put on workshops, covering
topics such as personal safety, asset
protection, and self defense.

“We put on about 200 security work-
shops to various groups on this cam-
pus each year,” said Grier.

Another service provided by the Pitt
Police is the system of emergency
phone lines around campus. There are
about 300 emergency phones, includ-
ing about 70 outdoors. If a student
sees what she considers to be a dan-
gerous or suspicious situation, then
she can just open the box and push the
button. A board then lights up in the
station, so even if nobody speaks, the
police know where to go. Or, if she
does decide to say something on the
phone, then the policeman will be
ready to send the appropriate response
based on the information given.

This emergency phone system has
recently been upgraded to include
every campus phone. Just dialing 811
immediately connects one to an emer-
gency dispatcher. If off campus, then
dialing 911 on any public telephone

booth will connect you with a city dis-
patcher for fire, police or ambulance,
with no quarter required to make the
call. ,

Grier warns students not to get
involved in a potentially dangerous
situation, but if they see something
wrong, to call for help. “Contact us, so
that we can do our job,” he said.

Pitt’s Department of Parking and
Transportation has also gone great
lengths to ensure safety on campus.
The University has an extensive cam-
pus bus and shuttle service, with eight
defined routes that go to North
Oakland, South Oakland, Shadyside,
and Squirrel Hill.

“Those particular transportation
routes are safe and reliable, and they
usually transport about 10,000 stu-
dents a day,” said Grier.

Pitt also has an agreement with the
public busing system that allows stu-
dents who show their IDs to ride for
free within the Pitt Zone, which
includes Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, and
much of Oakland.

The Student Government Board too
has taken an active position in improv-
ing campus safety. '

Justin DalMolin, an SGB member,
has recently led a movement to
expand the Van Call Service offered
by the Department of Parking and

a.m. on Thursday through Saturday,
but the SGB has lobbied to expand the
hours to 5 a.m. on those days, and it
continues to run until 2:30 a.m.
Sunday through Wednesday. The vans
begin to run at 7 p.m. everyday.

DalMolin said that he was very
pleased to get this expanded service.
“It’s definitely going to five in the
morning, which I think is the impor-
tant thing,” DalMolin said.

He cites the 24-hour computing lab
as a very compelling reason for having
the expanded hours. He is also happy
with the results of reorganizing the

_ service. “We actually saved a couple

Transportation, which provides two,

roving vans for transporting students

thousand dollars by rescheduling.”
The Van Call service seems very
popular with many students, accord-
ing to Michelle Moore of the
Department of Parking; and
Transportation. “Our surveys imply
that students who use the service are
happy with it,” she said. “Duringthe
fall, we get anywhere from 80 to 100
[calls per night], sometimes even over
100, depending on
what’s going on

versities, inc1udingVPenn State and the.
D University of Cincinnati. It had been

in the idea stage for about seven years
before being instated for a trial period
last spring.

At an SGB meeting earlier this
month, it was decided to extend that
trial period until October first, follow-
ing a debate about whether to keep
the program at all. This extension
allows the SGB to get sample infor-
mation about how the service will be
used by students this year.

“I still don’t think that a lot of peo-
ple know it’s there,” said Jocelyn
Cortese, the program’s director for the
SGB, after the meeting.

The usage through the first part of
the trial period was not as high as the
SGB had hoped initially, and that is
why the trial period was extended at
the last meeting, instead of it being
decided whether or not to continue the
program on an ongoing basis.

Parking and Transportation that funds

gram, with only

Cortese is
happy with the
program, and
thinks that it
should be contin-
ued by the SGB,
but is confident
that, if dropped,
it will be picked
up by another
 . 'uJ5\\ University
department. She is particularly
pleased by the escorts themselves.

“I had a great set of employees,” she
said.

Cortese is also confident that stu-
dent usage of the service will pick up
in the fall. Cortese said that the feed-
back from students who have used the
service indicates that they are pleased
with it. “The response from the stu-
dents seems very promising.”

Nationa|ity/ Ethnic Groups

Pitt offers 20 nationality or lan-

opportunity to meet once a week for
the purpose of having discussion
groups about foreign cultures and
study abroad opportunities. These
clubs also provide a regular meeting
place to speak their respective lan-
guages, but they are in no Way
restricted to people who can speak
the language. -

Activities include watching for-
eign movies and plays, and playing
foreign games such as Pétanque
(French). ’

“[The French Club] is a place to
meet different people. For Americans,
it is an opportunity to meet French
people at the University as well,’’ said
Yves Citton, an assistant professor of
French.

will affect the number of students
joining the Greek chapters.

Extra workshops have also been
added by some fraternities to help
direct and monitor the students for
the upcoming changes. Alumni sup-
port has increased and the national
chapters have been notified of the
changes. Though not all Greeks
agree about how drastic the changes,
such as the new minimum QPA
requirement of 2.35, will be, most
agree that it’s time for a change.

“This year is a rebuilding
process—it’s a wait-and-see period,”
Mitchell said.

WPTS is a radio station. If you want to

.listen to it, tum to 92.1 FM. Ifyou want to

visit, go to 411 William Pitt Union. If you
want to get involved, read the following as
both an infomercial and a caveat.

Nuts, Bolts, Buttons and Knobs

PTS, as it’s‘ affectionately called, is a
non-commercial formatted college station
owned by Pitt and run by its students. Its atti-
tude is laid back and its potential is only as
limited as the creativity and motivation of its
DJs.

'Ih'e forrrrat is primarily indie rock (so
you won’t get most DJ s to admit they’re cre-
ative or motivated) but traditionally, the line-
up has been generously embellished with hip
hop, jazz, reggae and dancehall, oldies, punk,
ska, goth, metal, hounce, trance, jungle and
other dance styles, as well as shows with
such specialties as Frank Zappa, Canadian
rock, and live local band broadcasts;

PT S has been the early stomping ground
for local music journalists and promoters, as
well as many who have gone on to jobs at

large stations and record companies. PTS is
the home base for a new college radio email
list which, in its first weeks of existence,
already boasts over 100 subscribers stateside
and across the pond.

PTS was a pillar in the local live show
scene, sponsoring scads of balls—out local and
national acts for years. But-because of some
bad decisions and the powers that be, not
these years. But that’s a bitter point, so we
won’t dwell on it.

Several local groups who long»-enjoyed
most-favored band status have gone on to
major record deals. Most recently, The Karl
Hendricks Trio (as in, “Do you have that Karl
seven inch?” or “I was talking to Karl the
other day and...”) has signed to Merge but
hasn’t left rotation. Rusted Root, however,
was never there. Nor was Pearl Jam, ever-
clear, or Alanis Marisette, and they never will
be. Ever.

Intro to College Radio-I’m Only Gomra
Say This Once
College radio is kind of like L.A. — if

Monday, August 26, 1996

you don’t get it, you don’t deserve it. Then
again, if you don’t get it, you probably don’t
like it. So, it all works out in the end

At its worst, college radio is an armoy—
ing, apathetic collection of slackers, egorna—
niacs, and elitists with bad radio voices and
too much —-— or too little — to say. Or worse
still, cookie—cutter frequency ﬁllers run not
by students, but by sub—corporate feel—good
liberals who just can’t get enough of that
multi—culti, saccharine—p1easant, innocuous
vomit—folk, leaving little room for real exper-
imentation, no room for surprises, and plenty
of room for fundraising beg—a—thons.

But at its best, college radio is the last
bastion of independent, underexposed music,
only to be outdone by pirate radio. The typi-
cal college radio philosophy is a attempt to be
atypical. It’s based on stylish, pop—post-mod-
em ideas that “altema—kids” were weened on.

. It’s a departure from the upper echelon
of the music industry, the part that we have
shoved down our throats day and night on
commercial stations. It’s both in—your-face

 

Intravenous Theatre will fix you up

If an incoming freshman asked me
about the kinds of things that Pitt students do
in the summer, I would probably say that
most people around here spend summer
nights and ﬁee time blowing bong hits into

I roommates’ faces. Perhaps two years at the

University has left me jaded, but I don’t
envision many Pitt students reading Fanon
and rousing fellow students to mass action,
nor do I envision many students reading the
literature of Thomas Mann, nor do I envision
many students doing much of
anything. The Oakland cam-
pus of the University of
Pittsburgh, with its oﬂ°-campus
parties that consist of three
chambered water bongs and
raging keggers, is not known as
a sanctuary of intellectual and
creative activity. _

However, the handful of
students who choose to dedicate their lives to
thetheat1ehereatPittdoknowthepainand
pleasure of sustained mental activity. Theatre

artsmajorsarerequiredtologinaninordi-.

nate amount of time in costume shops, scene
shops, prop shops, and various otherisweat
shops in order to fully learn the art of the the-
atre. A couple of theatre guys here at Pitt-
the recently graduated Aaron Christian

' Harms and the soon-to-be graduated Joel

Lee Kulp have applied their classroom

é<;/
Zea
éc/ i.v.

knowledge to reality and have fonned their
own theatrecompany, Intravenous.

Kulp and Harms are both student actors
and ﬁlmmakers who have performed and
directed in Pitt Theatre and Pittsburgh
Filmmakers circles. Ku1p’s most recent stage
credits include “The School For Scandal”
and “Clyterrmestra”, both Pitt rnainstage
productions, while _ Harms was last seen
screaming in “Enrico IV”, Pitt’s workshop
last spring. Kulp is due to graduate with a
major in Theatre Arts this
December andHarmshas just
attained his degree in Film
Studies.

So what are these two
actor-types doing and why
am I writing about them?
They had the initiative to put
the bong down and do sorne-
thing constructive with their
time...like start their own theatre company.
Intravenous was fonned with the image of a
doped-up, scar—infested Iggy Pop perform-
ing in the raw, in mind. Performing “from
the gut”, as Kulp says, is one of ﬂie many
goals that Intravenous has in mind.
Normally, when your average Joe thinks of a
theatre company, he thinks of a group of
people performing theatre. But Intravenous
is not performing theatre. Not theatre?

PUNK music bound

Lois Maffeo co—found—

If you think PUNK

Fﬂ"  GlliCle...wIIere lo go lo see what.

Beehive Coffeehouse, 3807
Forbes Ave., Oakland 687-
WHAT

Formerly the'Old King’s Court
Theater, The Beehive is Pitt’s most
accessible movie theater. Complete
with reclining seats, thrift store
couches, and a mini-balcony with
tables, The Beehive is easily the
Oakland area’s most eclectic place
to see art films, independent fea-
tures, and the occasional second-
run blockbuster. -

Harris Theater, 809 Liberty
Ave., Downtown 471-9700

The Harris used to be one of the
downtown area’s few remaining
porno theaters. Now its a sterilized,
respectable yuppie parlor that
screens independent features and
art films brought to the city by
Pittsburgh Filmmakers. One of the
few places to see Sundance and
Cannes Film Festival contenders,
the Harris is easily accessible by
taking any bus downtown and get-
ting off near the adult bookstores.

Melwood Screening Room,
477 Melwood Ave.,- North
Oakland 471-9700

Located off Baum Boulevard
near the Graffiti nightclub, The
Melwood is the Pittsburgh
Filmmakers’ latest contribution to
local cinematic culture. Their main
fare generally consists of critically
acclaimed foreign films and lesser
known independents, as well as the
occasional short by any number of
local directors. Also take a look at
the Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ photog-
raphy gallery, located in the lobby
of The Melwood.

Rex Theater, 1602 East Carson
St., South Side 381-2200

Named
Pittsburgh” by In Pittsburgh and
City Paper ‘readers, The Rex began
screening films by artsy American
directors and big name foreign stu-
dios after» the closing of the
Pittsburgh Playhouse a few years
ago. The Rex tends to screen the
same film for weeks, with the occa-
sional weekend feature or midnight
matinee. For $5 a year, "you can
become a Rex V.I.P. member and
receive discounted ticket rates and
movie premier invitations.

CarnegFie Museum of Art
4400 orbes Ave., Oakland
622-3212

The Carnegie Museum’s art V

“Best Theater in’

department boasts an intelligent and
discriminating film program which
usually limits itself to obscure for-
eign cinema and cultural documen-
taries. Occasionally, newly restored
prints of classic "films are shown;
recent screenings have included
Scorcese’s Taxi Driver and the road
movies of Jim Jarmusch and Gregg
Arraki. Also worth a look is the
MOA Screening Room, a small
room located in the museum’s
Scaife Gallery which runs video art
and documentaries on a television
screen. Student discount with I.D.

Films

Allegheny Ave., North Side
237-340

Boasting an enormous, wrap-
around OmniMax screen, the
Science Center screens educational
documentaries on everything from
underwater sea life to the Kuwait
Oil Fires. Lots of kids like to eat
acid and go there. For the culturally
impaired, midnight laser shows
come complete with a “classic” or
“grunge” rock soundtrack every
weekend. They also ran a bitchin’
Rolling Stones flick a few years
back.

Centur Square Maxi-Saver,
2001 ountainview Dr., West
Mifflin 655-8700

For those of you lucky enough
to own a car, take a trip to the
Maxi—Saver, probably the only four-
teen~screen second run house in the
country. You’ll never see a new
movie here, but you’ll never pay
more than two dollars, either. All
Wednesday shows only one dollar!

house, although they’ll occasional-
ly pick up worthwhile independents
that Pittsburgh Filmmakers either
wasn’t interested in, or only played
for a short time. Easily accessible
from Pitt by taking a bus down-
town, catching the South Hills trol-
ley, and getting off at the Mt.
Lebanon stop.

Hollywood Theater, 1449
Potomac Ave., Dormont, 341-
2800

The Hollywood is of interest
mainly because it’s the only place
in town to see The Rocky Horror
Picture Show, shown every
Saturday at midnight. During the
week, second—run mainstream films
are shown at a discount. Take the
South Hills trolley into the suburbs
and get off at Dormont.

Garden Theater, l2 W. North
Ave., North Side, 321-4262

The Garden Theater is, sadly
enough, the only place left in
Pittsburgh to see porn on the silver
screen. The theater is probably
going to be bought out by the
Cultural Trust sometime soon, so
get it while it’s hot and steamy,

For those of you who haven’t

Orgone are definitely the greatest
thing film has going for it in
Pittsburgh. At least once a month,
usually at the Silver Eye Gallery
(1015 East Carson St., South Side)
they show a variety of national and
local filmmakers in a very cool,
PUNK ROCK atmosphere. No show
more than three bucks, complimen-
tary snack always included. Orgone
has teamed up with the Warhol on

Well, as Kulp and Harms delicately put
it, they are staging a “performance piece”.
Intravenous is staging a production of “27” ,
a combination of 2 one—act plays. Kulp is
directing the ﬁrst play, “27 Wagons Full of
Cotton”, which happens to be written by
Tennessee Williams, and Harms is directing
a piece written by himself, appropriately
titled “2  These plays are part of the artis-
tic tiadition known as theatre, but Kulp and
Harms are not performing theatre. They are
wary of people putting labels on different
types of artistic perfonnance, and are reluc—
tant to call it theatre, or performance art, or
anything in particular. ’

When asked about this situation, Kulp
spoke of the stigrnas generated by labels like
‘theatre’: “People come in to a theatre and

they expect a certain thing. They expect to sit
down, to enjoy the show, and that’s it.”

Kulp and Harms want to broaden the
aspects of performance, and break out of tra-
ditional aspects of theatre, which is why they
have chosen a rather non—traditional perfor-
mance space for their piece—Sip Cafe in
Shadyside. The times of the show are also
kind of non~t1aditional (midnight for every
show).

Intravenous wants to “kill the facade”,
as Harms says, of what most people think of
theatre and put performance into a different
kind of atmosphere. Basically, Kulp and
Harms are “doing their art” and their art has
no limitations and no boundaries. “27” is a
perfonnance piece, but will have not live up
to the expectations that theatre people and
performance art people might have. For
instance, Sip is allowing coffee and other
perfunctory refreshments to be consumed

Tl-IE PI'I“I' NEWS

during the show. Harms likens the perfor-
mance to the showing of a live band.

“When people come to see a live band,
they don’t have certain expectations, they
just want to see the musicians doing their
thing. And if they fuck up, they fuck up.
That’s just how it is.”

As theatre artists, the Intravenous mem-
bers are simply going to do their ‘thang’. So
their artistic mission is rather pure, as they
are simply going to release their art, but they
are not forgetting about the accesibility of
their show to the audience. “We are not per-
forming for the audience, but with them,”
Kulp says. Some purists might deride their
efforts as pretentious bullshit, but I applaud
the efforts of young theatre people getting off
their asses and having the gumption to do
something for their art.

In an ideal situation, an energetic fresh—_

man interested in theatre might read this arti-

cle and actually be inspired to start their own
theatre company and enjoy the fulﬁllment of
actually producing art for art’s sake. Of
course, interested students can simply
involve themselves in Pitt Theatre and act,
stage manage, kiss various asses, and even
eventually direct. Now I am not trying to dis-
suade the general student body from partici-
pating in Pitt Theatre, I am simply reporting
what people can do outside the university.

Staging a play is not an easy effort, and it ,

takes months of planning and effort.

Kulp and Harms have been working on
“27” since last May, and four months later,
it’s all coming together. The ﬁrst step in the
process is procuring the rights to produce the
play. Most plays in the United States are pub-
lished by the Dramatists Play Service or
Samuel French Ir1c., so one would have to
contact the publishing company and arrange

to purchase the rights to perform the show.
Rights must be purchased because the author
of the play, under U.S. copyright laws, must
be paid royalties for every performance of
his or her play, in much the same way that a
novelist is paid royalties every time his or her
book is purchased. '

Kulp and Harms were required to pay ’

$25 per performance, but they founda loop-
hole that counters that stipulation by making
the performance not-for—proﬁt. How are they
ﬁnancing ﬂre production? By making their
costs public-that’s the cheese. They are ask-

1 ing for a meager donation from the audience,

which should solve that problem.

ple would have to contact theatres to arrange '

a contract by which to use their space. But,
since Kulp and Harms aren’t performing the-
atre, they started looking into other kinds of
venues that are condusive to perfonnance
pieces...like Charlie’s (the venue formerly
known as Luciano’s), a restaurant—bar—per—
forrnance space-hole—in the wall uptown
near Duquesne University. Charlie’s fell
through when new owners proved to be
uncooperative and financially anal, so
Kulpand Harms moved on and found some
accomodating people at Sip Cafe in
Shadyside. The owner of Sip was very
receptive to their project and isn’t even
charging the two for space.A1l it takes is a lit-
tle gumption, but as demonstrated by these
two punks, it is possible to put on your own
play, or performance, or whatever kind of art.

Joel Lee Kulp has directed “27 Wagons
Full of Cotton” before for his Directing 2

 -Pl'I"I'. NEWS '

class here at Pitt, but heiviews this experi-
ence as completely diiferent. “This is only a
part of the whole show, not one show on its
own,” says Kulp, as his Directing project
was limited by classroom themes and goals
and was performed in the Studio Theatre in
the Cathedral of Learning. He is now using
diiferent actors and is involved in a diiferent
atmosphere with different goals and expec-
tations. Harms acted in Kulp’s Directing
one—act, and was inspired to write his play
about the same characters and situations
soon after the show closed. Harms’ back-
ground is primarily in ﬁlm, so his piece is
more visual and reads and plays more like a
ﬁlm than a play.

“27” is about Southern people and cot-
ton. There are three characters whose con-
ﬂicts revolve around cotton gins, sex, and
various other things that bring people togeth-
er. Jake, a big, tough plantation owner is

played by Harms himself, while Silva
Vrcarro, a womanizing visitor to J ake’s plan-
tation is played by third-year Pitt student
Brent Korson, and the character Flora is por-
trayed by Sue Galloway, yet another Pitt
junior. Korson has appeared in "The School

' For'Scandal” with Kulp, ‘and most recently

was in “King Lear”, while Sue Ga]loway’s
most recent credits include Eric Bogosian’s
“Suburbia”, as well as “Lear”.

If theatre is an interest of yours and the
wooden Mexican marijuana pipe loses its
appeal sometime during the beginning of
this semester, check out “27”. You might get
something out of it.

2 7 runs Thurs. thru Sat. ﬁom September
12th — 14th and September 19th—21st at Sip
Cafe, 238 Spahr Street, Shadyside, around
the corner from Hey Betty.’ Every Show
starts at midnight. Expect to pay a meager
donation. —neil bose

That boy was Justin Hopper, by the way,
a local musician and PTS vet who has also
tapped out many a column on this very key-
board. He was the person who interviewed

me, admitted me to the training class my first

semester here, and gave me my board test,
and encouraged me to do his show the same
afternoon so he could go home and take a
nap. At the end of my ﬁrst two hours of fame,
fortuneand a soapbox, I collapsed on the
couch in the lobby bemoaning my many
mess—ups. Marj, the secretary at the time and
resident “Mom,” told me it was going to be
OK and next time it would be a lot easier.

I still makes lots of mistakes, but now
my screw-ups are a lot more, urn, sophisti-
cated. And technical. Yeah. .

Over the undisclosed number of years,
I’ve blearily started the programming day
and nostalgically ended it many a time. I’ve

taken naps there, crammed for ﬁnals, held a

some of the coolest people in the city. It’s the

A Lie of the Mind
directed by Tim Golebiewski
Pitt Theatre

The Theatre Arts Department
here at the sometimes captivating
University of Pittsburgh is trying to
get everyone on campus into a rockin’
theatre mood by presenting Sam
Shepard’s A Lie of the Mind- during
the second weekend of this semester.
Billed as a ‘special season preview’ in
the press release, A Lie of the Mind
first opened on Broadway starring
such stalwarts as Harvey Keitel and
Aidan Quinn.

For those who aren’t familiar
with Shepard’s award—winning plays
like Buried Child and True West, I’m
sure everyone will remember him
from his thoughtful role alongside
Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington
in the film The Pelican Brief A Lie of
the Mind is being directed by Tim
Golebiewski, who recently attained
his Pitt M.A. in Theatre Design and
holds such directing credits as Mud,
Us, and Phaedra for Pitt, and Hecuba
for the Unseam’d Shakespeare
Company. He happens to have
designed A Lie...as well. Rounding out
the cast is Pittsburgh theatre veteran
