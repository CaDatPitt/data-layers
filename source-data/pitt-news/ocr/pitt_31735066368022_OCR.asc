Council Adopts PRMS Resolution

Cites Need For Faculty Review

By LAURIE MACLEOD

‘A senior vice chancellor will
have to consult with the Senate
Council before implementing or
approving a Planning Resource
Management Systems proposal,
according to a resolution adopted
by the council at its meeting
Monday.

The resolution, which passed by
an 18-16 vote, also states that a
senior vice chancellor must consult
with- the Senate Executive
Committee if he finds that PRMS
procedures should be bypassed.

PRMS is a university planning
document that is used when signif-
icant changes are being made in
academic or support areas in the
university. ‘

Wilfried Daehnick, chairman of
the Senate Budget Policies Com-
mittee, said PRMS procedures are
not being followed concerning
faculty input.

He cited as examples:

0 Failure to consult the affected
faculty prior to (or after) prepara-
tion of the final draft of the
proposal;

0 Preparation of a planning

proposal after the proposed
changes ha_ve been made and
implemented;

' 0 Major changes made with little‘

or no utilization of the PRMS
procedures.

“There's been a lot of grumbling
among deans and administrators
that the procedure is still a formal-
ity that delaysand hinders deci-
sions rather than helps them,"
Daehnick said. \ ,

Senior Vice Chancellor for
Administration, Jack Freeman,
said the request for Senate Review

before taking action “is restating

rofessor Interns With

I

To many Pittsburghers, the
Cathedral of Learning is nothing
but another tall building gracing
the city’s skyline. To Bill Wallisch,
however, it is the symbol that
prompted him to attend college in
the l960’s.

Wallisch is an American Coun-
cil on Education Fellow who is
currently ‘learning the ways of
Pitt’s administration in Chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar’s office.

An associate professor of English

at the United,States Air Force

Academy in Colorado Springs,
Colo'., Wallisch was one of 30 col-
lege professors around the nation
to be a chosen as a fellow.

Pitt was Wallisch’s first choice
because of both Posvar’s and the
university's national and interna-
tional reputations. .

The fellowship gives professors
and other administrators a chance
to be exposed to the best university
presidents and Chancellors around
the nation. /

"Posvar has been Pitt's chancel-

lor for 15 years and is truly one of_

the great university presidents of
this century," Wallisch said.

Wallisch grew up in Sheraden,
attended Langley High School and
graduated from Allegheny College
in Meadville, so his return to Pitts-
burgh is nostalgic. Working in
Posvar’s Cathedral office is also
nostalgic. he said.

“When I was a kid and thought
of high-er education, I thought of
the Cathedral of Learning,” he
said. .

Wallisch said he is impressed
with what he has seen so far at Pitt
since his fellowship started Sept. l.
The university's atmosphere is a
healthy and positive approach to
higher education, and the student
body at Pitt krfows what it is here
for.

Part of his duties as a fellow is to
travel to other schools—such as
Harvard and MIT—-and observe
their administrative workings.
Based on these travels and his expe-
rience as a professor, Wallisch said
that today’s American college stu-
dents are basically the same. i

what is already clearly stated in the
PRMS proposal."

Freeman also charged that the
resolution violates the present
PRMS proposal. because only the
chancellor can bypass PRMS
procedures. ’

After approving the resolution,
the Senate Council also voted to
establish a new standing commit-
tee called the Senate Community
Relations Committee. Its purpose
is to provide opportunities for
informal meetings between univer-
sity faculty, administration, and

' local community leaders.

Geography:

Waiting On

Decisions

The future of the geography’
department depends on Provost
Rhoten Smith, but no one is
quite sure when he’ll announc
his decision. ‘

Smith must recommend to

‘Chancellor Wesley Posvar
whether the department should
be terminated. A faculty com-
mittee of the Senate Council,
after reviewing the Planning
Resource‘ Management System
(PRMS) proposal for terminat-
ing the department. recom-
mended that it be continued.

The Senate Council reported
at its meeting Monday that the
termination proposal was at the
next level of the administration,
meaning it is now in the hands
of the provost. ,_

Wilfried Daehnick, chairman '
of the Senate Council's Budget
and Policies Committee, said
the provost should have made
his recommendation by now.
That recommendation will not
be made public, he said.

Smith was unavailable for
continent yesterday.

Mark Ozark, a graduate stu-
dent in the geography depart-
ment, said that the department
“is being kept in the dark” as to
when a decision will be made.

The Pitt News, Wednesday October 13, 1982

By JULIE HORN

The Pitt Men's Glee Club,
one of the oldest extracurricular
activities on campus, is
attempting to restructure itself
after a sharp decline in
membership.

John Yankee, who was hired
last year to reorganize the
group, said the club has died in
the last 10 or 15 years partly
because Pitt is largely "a commu-
ter school and students don't
have many idle hours.

“It appears that in the last
few years, decline in enrollment
and interest have led many to
believe that ‘the ensemble has
folded or is on the verge of fold-
ing,” Yankee said.

When Yankee came to Pitt,
he started with one member in
the club, but has built it up to a
“very strong six-member club,”
consisting of a former Pitt stu-
dent, a graduate student, two
sophomores and two freshmen.

“There’s talent, but basically
an image has to be set,” he said.
The Pitt Men's Glee Club
hasn't had a budget for years,
and because of this, it hasn’t
been able to re-establish a

Glee club Revived

budget this year. However, the
club receives support through
the music department, accord-
ing to Yankee.

“The absence of a men’s sing-
ing group at Pitt would mean a
large gap musically,” he said,
“and there is an abundance of
music for such voices."

He said it is not realized that
although many music groups
have turned co-ed, there are still
traditional men’s and women’s
vocal groups that are smaller in
size, but are more flexible than
mixed choruses.

The name “glee club” carries
many connotations, Yankee
said, but the Men’s Glee Club is
considering changing its name
to give the ensemble a distinc-
tive identity.

He said there is a need to re-
establish the integrity of the
ensemble. “No auditions are
necessary, but at the same time,
musicianship is essential and
will be stressed in every facet of
the ensemble’s activities.”

Yankee said he hopes the
group can become very visible
and flexible, “because frequent
performances can only add pol-
ish and energy to the ensemble.

Newsbriefs

Detre
Appointed
Administrator

,Thomas Detre, M.D., director
of Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic (WPIC) and chair-
man of the department of psy-
chiatry in the School of
Medicine, has been appointed
associate senior vice chancellor
for the Health Sciences at the
University of Pittsburgh. The
appointment, announced by

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar, V

becomes effective immediately.

Detre will retain his office as
director of WPIC but will
vacate the chairmanship of the
department of psychiatry. A
search will be initiated for a
new chairman.

In making the announce-
ment Posvar said, “Our future
mission throughout the health
sciences requires greater
emphasis on new initiatives in
research and in attracting out-
standing scientists and clini-
cians. Detre's experience here at
the university has qualified him
for this position. His accomp-

lishments during his nine-year
tenure include the recruitment
of distinguished faculty from
all over the world in many spe-
cialties of behavior medicine
and psychiatry, an impressive
increase in research funding
and building the multi-story
Education and Research Center
at WPIC."

“I look forward to these new
challenges eagerly," Detre said.
It will be most rewarding to
have the opportunity to build
on the solid reputation and
accomplishments of our
schools of the health sciences in
the educational, clinical and
research areas.”

Detre will be principal dep-
uty to Nathan Stark, senior vice
chancellor for the Health Scien-
ces, with oversight on all six
schools of the health sciences:
medicine, dentistry, nursing,
pharmacy, puDl1C health and
health related professions.

Detre has been professor and
chairman of the department of

psychiatry and director of
WPIC since 1973. He is recog-
nized as a distinguished clini-
cian.and researcher, responsi-
ble, in collaboration with

David Kupfer, M.D., for the
development of a sophisticated
psychiatric information system.

Prior to coming to Pitts-
burgh he was professor of Psy-
chiatry at Yale University and
psychiatrist-in-chief of the
Yale-New Haven Hospital.
Detre was born in Budapest,

Hungary, where he began his
studies of psychiatry and medi». 
cine. He completed his medical
education in Rome and his
postgraduate psychiatric train-
ing at Yale University. His

interests are wide-ranging. In

addition to a comprehensive
textbook entitled “Modern Psy-
chiatric Treatment,” which was
published in 1971, Detre is the
author of numerous articles and
chapters on such topics as re-
current depression, violence
and aggression in children and
other biologic aspects of mental
disorders. .

,,Candidates Will Defendviews

By PEGGY FERRI

In view of the fact that the arms
race is an important issue in the
coming elections, the Pitt Arms
Race Study Group will be holding
a (Iandidates Night tonight in
Forbes Quad to offer candidates a
public forum to discuss their views
on the issues of disarmament, the
nuclear freeze and world peace.

Incumbent democrat William
Coyne will be among those car1di—
dates attending, according to Can-
didates Night coordinator Susan
Harland. The Arms Race Study
Group will also be presenting two
more candidates nights, ()ct I9 and
26.

“It is interesting that all Repub-
licans declined the offer to appear.
although Sen. john Heinz may
send a surrogate in his place," Har-
land said. She added that other can-
didates, especially the Libertar-
ians, were happy just to be
provided with the chance to speak.

didates. At its regular Tuesday
meeting, the study group discussed
this “frustrating" problem.

Pitt professor and Consumer
Party candidate Liane .\'orman
said that, at first, the 1’o5t-Gazette
was reluctant to grant her the satire
pre—endorsement interview that
was granted to other candidates

“The press serves the two-patty

According to I Iailatid, this night
will provide people with a chance
to hear all views and gain a clear
idea of where the candidates stand.
She said that there are many ways
to respond to the arms race, such as
inarching and writing letters, but it‘
is also important to influence the
arms race through -the electoral
process.

Pittsbrughers. for example, will
be voting on whether the mayor
should report the amount of Pitts-
burgh tax dollars that are funneled
to the military. Harland said that,
although the form of this proposal
will be a little confusing on the
ballot, it does provide a means to
educate both the_people and the
mayor, who will be required to

make a yearly report to the people.
The voter should be aware that
he can shape government policies
if he has a clear idea of what the
different candidates stand for.
According to Harland, a voter can
do that by asking questions.
“\\’e’re hoping that a lot of peo-

ple take advantage of this chance to
ask candidates how they stand on
the issues," Harland explained.
Figures show that the number of
registered voters has increased
nationally. Harland said she hopes
that people will involve themselves
more than they have in the past.

“Students are so wrapped up in
their immediate, school-related
problems that they don’t think
about politics," Harland said.
"Some others have a fatalistic view
of the war——as if it is inevitable, but
it is out of their hands—and that I
find terrifying."

interning With Posvar

continued from page one

“I think you can draw a parallel
between American students," he
said. “There is a certain mood on
campus. The mood is one of a
serious pursuit of a life's
vocation.”

He said students are also con-
cerned about _the state of the
nation's economy.

There are some differences
between the students at Pitt and at
the Air Force Academy, he said.
The students at his school are pre-
paring themselves for five years or
more in the Air Force, and Pitt stu-

dents do not get paid S:30() a month
to go to school. .

‘.\'allisch "also said he does not
think Pitt's commuters stiffer
because they commute. He said Pitt
offers the best of both worlds: the
chance to attend a first—class uni-
versity" and still live at home.

“Sometimes I worry that people
don‘t realize how good a school
Pitt is or aren't proud of it," he
said.

Wallisch is the director of Media
Instruction at the Air Force
Academy and teaches courses
related to television and the mass

&

rnedia . His students produce a tele-
vision show called_ “The Blue
Tube,” which won the intercolle-
giate Broadcasting Award two
years ago.

Wallisch said he is required to
write arather long paper about his
experiences at Pitt after his fellow-
ship is complete next fall. He said
he expects to return to his position
at the Air Force Academy more
knowledgeable.

“I think I will gain strength
what I see of Posvar's
leadership.”

The Masculine Dilemma of Shaving

By MICHAEL ROKNICK

There are events in thelives
of men that hold great signifi-
cance. Shaving, however, is not

one of them. Shaving has

become a daily ritual in which a
blade meets skin and trans-
forms the visage. into the
smooth clean-cut look that has
become the status quo.

For some, the ritual has
become a process to avoid,
while for others, it is a charac-
teristic of the pleasure-pain
principle. But in almost all
instances, the process itself

remains the same—-a slow ardu- .

ous task.

This process begins each
morning as the man stumbles
his way into the bathroom.
Then, looking into the mirror
and seeing the stubble that has
appeared overnight, the ques-
tion is asked. “Do I need to
shave today?” J

The answer given to the
question is always the same.
“Yes.” So with the foam in one
hand and razor in the other, the
shaving starts.

The first casualties are the
sideburns, the cheeks follow a
close second. The blade sweeps
down I the face, tearing hair

from skin (and sometimes skin
from skin), which is soon
rinsed down the drain. The
neck and chin are the next areas
to recieve the treatment.

It is the chin area that gives
most males the hardest time. It
contains the highest density of
hair growth and has the sharp-
est curves on the face. This
leads to many cuts, which are
introduced to tissue paper or
septic pencil. The latter offers
the quickest solution, but it is
also the most painful. It is for
this reason that the septic pen-
cil is used sparingly.

There is, however, a grow-
ing number of men who have

decided to forego this ritual by ~
donning beards. Although the ‘

task of shaving is reduced sub-
stantially by having a beard,
there is still grooming to be
done. The bearded men have
paved the way for a new frontier
in which men can unite and
decide the future of shaving.
This future can be seen in the
face of Robby DeFazio. He has
given up shaving and opted for
the beard. DeFazio, a student at
Pitt, admitted that it was a hard
decision. He believes some
women don’t understand what
men have to go through every
day by scraping their faces.

“If girls don’t want to shave
their legs, they can put on a pair
of pants, but the same doesn’t
apply for a guy. When was the
last time you saw a guy with
pants on his face?” he asked.

DeFazio claimed that there is ’

a bias againt men who have
decided to grow a beard. When
a man starts to grow a beard, he
is asked why.

In order to check this
hypothesis, I decided to go one
day without shaving and see
what the reaction was. It should
be stated that I am a meticulous
shaver.

The reactions received were
indeed interesting. There are a
variety of words associated with
a man who has decided to grow
a beard. The phrases “five
o’clock” and “attack of the
nubs” were used most fre-
quently among women. Men
opted for the more concise, sin-
gle word descriptions like
“grubby” and “growth.”

However, I found the tacit
opinion of most to be that
growing a beard is distasteful,
perhaps totally wrong. There
was also the feeling that some-
thing terrible must have hap-
pened if a‘ man who used to

shave suddenly stopped.

There were many different
guesses as to what this terrible
event might be. A bad night or a
personal tragedy were common
among the guesses.

“What happened?”

“What do you mean?”
“You didn’t shave.”

“So?”

“Well, you always shave.”
“I decided not to today.”
“That’s really unlike you.”

The girl in the conversation
ended by saying that she liked
men without beards. This atti-
tude is prevalent, not only in
women, but in men as well.

Most people believed that
beards are worn by men who are
dishonest or of low character. It
was also believed that the right
beard (thick and blond) charac-
terized a man as an outdoors-
man. Many of the people
interviewed agreed that an out-
doorsman is rugged, but most
also thought of him as less
intelligent.

So, a beard may make a man
appear to have not only a differ-
ent character, but also a lower
level of intelligence. This may
encourage many men to shave.

It would be unfair to say that
all people think of men with
beards as less intelligent, but
the attitude in our society is

that a man who does not shave _

is not following norms.
The future of shaving is in

Igdoubt. There are many who

would contend that science will
make shaving cream and the
razor blade obsolete. If so, it
will be welcomed by men who

would like to give up shaving“

forever. -

Though advertising tells of
the glamor and sexiness of
shaving, the men at Pitt think
of it as a daily evil that has to be
endured. This can readily be
seen in morning classes. Early
classes are a disadvantage for a
man who wants both to sleep in
and have a smooth face: There
is little doubt as to which
course of action is most fre-

" quently chosen.

Not
Again

Still waiting to hear about your student loan?
Don’t feel as though you’ve been unfairly singled
out—you’re not alone. Because of tardy government
decisions about loan eligibility and general confu-
sion about aid requirements, many students are
being forced to wait for the red tape to be untangled
before they can gettheir financial aid.

Colleges usually get the bulk of their federal aid
money for students in July, but this year, National
Direct Student Loans, Supplemental Educational
Opportunity Grants, and college work-study pro-
gram funds were delayed. Letters from the federal
government announcing the colleges’ access to these
programs were not received until October 4.

In addition, a special loan program for parents of
college students faced another kind of delay because
of government ‘paperwork. The Auxiliary Loans to
Assist Students Program calls for the interest to drop
if the rate paidon U.S. Treasury Bills is less than H
percent for a year. But the education department
announced recently that those rates, which were to
be reduced on October I, won’t be dropped until
next month.

At Pitt, Dan May, director of the financial aid
office, said confusion about changing eligibility
requirements and late decisions by the government
are creating havoc for his staff. May said earlier this
year that many students are waiting because they
didn’t have enough information on their forms.

What all this has meant for colleges is that they
have to help students who are waiting for money
attend college.

Deferment programs, under which tuition can be
paid in increments, are available at Pitt and other
schools. Some schools are offering emergency loans

Socrates Learns About Voting

By STEVE PARKS

Intro: Socrates, out of work,
out of money and out of clean
togas, lies dejectedly on his new
home, the park bench! Lying
there, he ponders what will
happen next when a stranger
appears and sits next to him.
The newcomer takes out a
brown bag and starts to feedlthe
birds. ‘

“Looks awful good,” said a
starving Socrates.

“Just chicken feed,” the man
said, flashing a broad grin.

“I wish I had the money to
buy chicken feed.” ,

“Heck, most unemployed
people would be happy just to
work for chicken feed,” he said,
his lips forming a frown.

(Pitt is one such school) or using money from other
areas to cover costs.

What it all means is a giant headache for everyone
involved. Schools may spend the rest of the year
trying to straighten out their books. Students will
have to find ways to manage while they are waiting
for the money they are supposed to be living on.

The problem this year is that there is nothing to do
but wait. There's no way to reverse the mistakes that
have already been made. We can only hope that the
Department of Education and the Reagan Adminis-
tration will take pains to avoid this mess next year. It
would be nice if student could think about what
they’re learning in school instead of worrying about
how—and when —they’re going to pay for it.

job? Reaganomics?” questi-
oned Socrates.

“Yep, sure wish I’d voted in
the last election."

“You didn’t vote in the elec- I

tion!” said a shocked Socrates.

“I never thought he’d win,”
he explained.

“Nobody did. Still,
should have voted.”

“I didn’t have time.”

“What were you doing?”
Socrates asked. '

“Why, I was running the big-
gest business in the world!” he
said proudly.

“Oh, big business isn't
affected by elections,” offered
Socrates.

you

“Of course they are! Why my
job depended on this election!”
he retorted.

“Then if it's so important,
why didn't you make time?"

“When pet rocks were the
rage," Socrates asked, “did you
go out and buy one?"

“Of course not, that’d be
stupid!"

“Stupider than not voting
because no one else did?” asked
a confused Socrates.

“That's not fair,” he
protested.

“Was Reagan’s winning.

fair?”

“No,” the man replied, “But
he won ’cause of them commer-
cials. All he did was pick on the
personal aspects of my
fam...er...the presidents’
family.”

“How’d he get away with
that?” asked Socrates.

“’Cause they were funny, but
they didn’t have any substance.
All they were was a bunch of
one liners."

“Unlike Carter's.’

“Well...,” he said hesitantly.

“Anyway,” Socrates inter-
rupted.

“So the people who did vote
didn’t know what they were vot-

ing for,” announced the
stranger, his toothy grin
reappearing.

“But whose fault was it that
they didn’t know?”

“The candidates’,” he
suggested.

“Why?" Socrates asked.

“They’re supposed to present
the issues!” pleaded the
stranger.

“But if the only people who
are going to vote are the staunch
supporters of the candidates or
those who buy pet rocks, why
should they?”

“I guess the public should
have asked more questions,” he
submitted, his lips turning into
a frown.

“So if you didn’t bother to ask
questions and didn’t bother to
vote, whose fault
you’re where you are.” “Mine,”
he painfully submitted.
“Exactly,” announced Socrates
proudly.

“Jimmy! jimmy! Run quick!
Amy spotted that killer rabbit
near Billy’s beer!” a female
voice shouted.

“Jimmy? Are you Jimmy
Carter?” asked a surprised
Socrates.

“No comment,” he answered,
running off to hide behind a
tree.

Socrates leaned back and
grabbed the bag of chicken feed.
As he ate his first meal in days,
he wondered about how many
people had voted ’em out by not
voting.

The Politics ofPitt Students

By RON BARBER

Soon Pitt’s campus will be
awash with posters as Student
Government Board (SGB) election
season is upon us once again._In
the weeks leading up to the elec-
tions .in early November, this
column will explore various
aspects of election politics at Pitt,
in search of a better understanding
of the forces that shape our student
government.

A likely starting pointfor this
investigation is to ask: Do some
identifiable groups have more pol-
itical influence on campus than
other groups? The success of one
fraternity in placing one of its own
in the SGB president’s chair each of
the past three years leads easily to
the conclusion that Greeks wield
decisive weight in student govern-
ment politics. A closer look at last

. year’s election, however, seems to

give a different picture. (The dis-
cussion that follows is based on the
voting for SGB board members.)
In last year’s voting, 55 percent
of all ballots counted were cast at
the Towers lobby poll. This sug-
gests that perhaps the Resident
Student Association (RSA) carries
considerable political weight, and
indeed, three out of four of the can-
didates officially endorsed by RSA
came out winners. But (if one lends
any credence to the notion that

“Towers lobby is the “home field“

0

P

of RSA), it is curious to note that
RSA’s picks did not fare well in
Towers voting. Robbie The, an
RSA—endorsed, candidate who
received more votes overall than
any of his competitors, drew an
average of 46 percent of the votes at
each poll. At Towers, however, he
drew only 35 percent, his worst
showing of the‘ election. Linda

O’Connor, with RSA backing, also
had her worst showing in Towers.

These results suggest, that while
RSA does not command the disci-
plined, voting of dorm students, the
large number of resident students
who vote can turn an RSA endorse-
ment into a— significant political
advantage. '

In terms of commanding disci-
plined voting from its constituents,
the Engineering Student Cabinet
(ESC) receives the highest marks.
As with the resident students and
Towers lobby, I assume here that
engineering students accounted for
the bulk of the ballots cast at Bene-
dum Engineering Hall. Each ESC-
endorsed candidate was selected by
at least 44 percent of the students
voting in Benedum, while no non-
endorsed candidate drew more

than 24 -percent of the vote there. In .

every case, ESC-endorsed candi-
dates scored well above their six-
poll average at Benedum, and
candidates without ESC backing
scored well below.

One may well wonder if disci-
plined voting at Benedum, which
handled only ll percent of the total
vote count last year, can have any
great impact on the outcome of an
election. But this impressive corre-
lation between ESC endorsements
and the fate of ten candidates at
Benedum, plus the ultimate suc-
cess of four out of the five ESC can-
didates in winning board seats,
suggests that ESC, with RSA, is
one of the most influential groups
on campus.

The Greeks fall perhaps just
behind these two groups. Many

lenic Association (IFC/Panhel)

Turning Clock Back

By TOM WANKO -

The concept of -“education as the
great equalizer” is. being aban-
doned throughout America and
few students seemto notice; fewer
seem to care. Students need to take
a look at the programs being
enacted at the local, state and fed-
eral level. The Reagan administra-
tion, Governor Thornburgh and
Chancellor Posvar are carrying out
programs which will "succeed in
accomplishing nothing less than
to put higher education out of the
reach of lower- and middle-income
students. They are engaged in an
effort to turn the clock back on the
social progress that has been won
over the past several decades. In
light of this, it appears as if only a
small number of students realize
where they should stand.

Are you a student with a PHEAA
guaranteed loan? If so, Reagan has
seen to it that you now “pay” a 5
percent origination fee on your
loan to the bank before you receive
it. Over a four-year period, you will
relinquish close to six hundred
dollars to the banks and be
expected to “pay that six hundred
back at 9 percent interest (until it
rises to expected levels of 12-14 per-
cent when you graduate), never
even deriving the benefits of using
this “fee”. If you currently receive a
PELL grant, then chances are that
you could be one of the 750,000
students out of 2 million who will
be adversely affected by the “fail-
ure” of the Reagan administration
to increase the PELL grant budget
to keep up with inflation. Next
year, under the proposed Reagan
budget, the PELL grant program
will be cut by over 800 million dol-
lars. If you are on a work-study pro-
gram, you can look forward to cuts
of close to 100 million dollars. If

that doesn’t seem likely enough,
how about national direct student
loans eliminated, supplemental
educational opportunity grants
eliminated and state student incen-
tive grants eliminated, totalling a
slashing of 523.1 million dollars.

Some might say that under Rea-
gan’s “new federalism” the states
will be picking up the “burden” of
assisting students. No way. Thanks
to “Mister" Dick Thornburgh,
Pennsylvania has the highest tui-
tion rate for publicschools in the
entire nation. Will the university
cut us a break? Hardly. Tuition
here at Pitt has been raised in 12 out
of the last 13 years consecutively,
while the Chancellor smiles all the
way to the bank. All the while, not
even a whimper of opposition is
voiced by student government. Stu-
dent government is, in my view,
supposed to be the representative of
and negotiator for student needs,
not a rubber stamp for administra-
tion screw policies.

Thomas Jefferson once wrote,
“Every government degenerates
when trusted to the rulers of the
people alone. The people them-
selves, therefore, are its only safe
depositories. And to render them
safe, their minds must be improved
to a certain degree.”

It has taken close to two hundred
years to make advances towards
realizing this great goal. Most of
these advances have taken place in
the post World War II era; they are
most recent phenomena in histori-
cal content". Consider that the G.I.
Bill was the first program to pro-
vide a vehicle to higher education
for mainstream lower-and middle-
class Americans returning home
from war. The next major advance
in educational opportunities for
mainstream Americans took places

5 ing),

the candidates who did well in
Towers voting had Greek back-
and this suggests some
strength in these organizations.
But only three of the seven contest-
ants with Greek support eventually
won board seats, the worst record
among endorsing organizations.

Candidates endorsed by The Pitt
News fared quite well in overall
voting, with‘three of the four easily
winning board positions, and the
fourth (James Shelton) coming
within just 43 votes of taking a seat
on the board. In addition, The Pitt
News’ was the only major endorse-
ment to include all three top vote-
getters (Robbie The, Chip Roth
and Linda O’Connor). Only the
fate of Colleen Clarke, Pitt News’
pick for president, casts some
doubt on the paper’s influence. (In
addition, my calculations would
have shown more strength for The
Pitt News if it had endorsed more

 successful candidates, or if candi-

dates it had not endorsed had fared
worse than they did in overall vot-
ing. Thus, only moderate results
for The Pitt News.)

Summarizing briefly, the Engi-
neering Student Cabinet, with an
impressinve show of strength at
Benedum Hall, and the Resident
Student Association, with less
strength multiplied by more voting
students, seemed able to influence a
great number of votes in last year's
SGB election. Signs of somewhat
less influence were shown be the
Interfraternity Council/Panhel-
lenic Association and The Pitt
News.

(Ealitor’s note: Ron Barber ran
unsuccessfully for SGB president

last year. His column will appear
weekly.)

on Social

with the passage of. the Higher
Education Act of 1965. This act
sought to make higher education
possible for the children of lower-
and middle-incomefamilies. This
bill “authorized the first program
to provide general grants to under-
graduate college students, and was

enacted in concert with loan and

work-study programs." In the
recent years since, minorities and
women have been able to derive
benefits from the enactment of
these and similar programs.

Now these programs are being
compromised by the current “rul-
ers”. What America faces in the ’80s
is nothing less than a return to the
elitist-type system present at the-
turn of the century. In 1900, only 4
percent of the 17-22 year age group
were attending college. By the '70s,
this figure had risen to almost 50
percent. Without student aid and
services, the majority of main-
stream Americans wishing to
attend college will be closed out by
financial barriers and left in an
educational void and thereby the
“right” to higher education will be
reserved for the wealthy only. I, for
one, don't feel our children should
have to be faced with the prospect
of only having a choice between
going to a community college or
attending a vocational school, but
these are the implications ofcuts in
student aid and services. Consider
the statements by Reagan’s secre-
tary of education, Bell:

“I don't think we’re going to be
as concerned with social reform
and equal opportunity in educa-
tion as with the survuval of our
system in a very, very competitive
world. The U.S. is no longer going
to be as dominant a power in the
world’s sphere as it has been in the
past, and it’s not going to be the
democratic issues that are going to

Who is to

By SCOTT REX

While events in the Middle
East have dominated the even-
ing news for the last months,
the problems of Central Amer-
ica have continued to deterio-
rate. In El Salvador, Major
Roberto d’ Aubuisson has been
unable ,to stop the guerrilla
movement.

According to last Sunday’s
New York Times, guerrillas
seized control of the town of Las
Vueltas, population 5,000. In
retaliation, the government
army, with the aid of U.S.-made
A-37 fighter planes and Huey
helicopters, bombed the town.

Actions such as these can
only gain popular support for
the guerrilla movement. Time
is on their side.

In Nicaragua, the United
States still supports right wing
attempts to overthrow "the San-
dinista government. To make
matters worse, we have enlisted
the aid of Honduras, which has
been accused of fighting the
guerrillas inside El Salvador.

Reports of widespread
government massacres are also
filtering out of Guatemala.
Remember when General
Montt was swept into power by
a military coup last March?
Remember when Montt told the
world that he was a devout
Christian? __

Some Christian. Since Gen-
eral Montt came to power 2,600
Indians and peasants, includ-
ing women and children, have
been executed by the Guate-
malen Army. This figure is
from Amnesty International.

What can the United States
do to avoid an international
conflict in Central America?

The first thing the State
Department and Secretary of
State Schultz need to do is to
attempt to solve our difference
with the government of Cuba.

2 excuse for our lack of foresight

Blame?

Every time something goes
wrong with our foreign policy
objectives in Central America
(if there are any), we point at
Castro and start yelling “Com-
munist subversion!” It is true
that Cuba has troops in Angola
and Ethopia. It is true that
Cuba has admitted to aiding the
guerrillas in El Salvador. But
we can not use Cuba as an

in solving the economic prob-
lems of Central America.

When ex-liberal‘ Senator
Church discovered that he was
perceived as too liberal, he
raised the point ofSoviet troops
in Cuba. This old information,
which made Church look like
Jessie Helms, was used to help
bog down the SALT II Treaty
in Congress. Cuba was used by
the conservatives to slow down
SALT II. Today, Cuba is being
used as a scapegoat for the
unrest in Central America.

I don’t have the answer for
dealing with Castro and his
efforts to resemble a powerful
world leader, but I do realize we
can no longer ignore the ten-
sions that exist between our
countries.

Our generation must realize
that war is not unthinkable. It
never has been and much to -
man’s regret, I doubt that it ever
will be. Just" because CBS stops
reporting the events in Central
America does not mean that all
those problems have disap-
peared.

If we. neglect to negotiate
with Castro, we will push him
into a polarizing position. By
using Cuba’s aid to the guer-
rilla movements as an excuse
for the economic realities of
Central America, we construct
those realities as 21 East vs. West
struggle. And these kinds of
problems are rarely solved at the
negotiating table.

Progress

keep us on the edge of our
seats...We have to educate for tech-
nology, for managing scarcity and
for competition and productivity.”

Without programs to assure the

opportunity to attend schools of‘

higher education, you may be the
last generation with the ability to
recognize the “rot” that'is spewing
forth from the Reagans, Thorn-
burghs and Posvars.

Consider where you stand, Pitt
students, and take a stand. Ifwe fail
to struggle againe picnic. Bruce
Rogers, current chairman of BAS
said the weekend was a “positive
and unifying experience.” —

The BAS plans to have former
Georgia state Senator Julian Bond
as the featured speaker of this year's
Black Week. Black Week is an
annual event whichreaquaints stu-
dents with their black heritage.
Last year, national syndicated
journalist Carl T. Rowan was the
featured speaker. A concert featur-

 ing Roy Ayers and Jean Carn, a

play and a soul food night were
held.

The BAS has one of the highest
memberships of all studentorgani-
zations on campus. Once a black
student is admitted to Pitt, he or
she automatically becomes a
member of BAS.

In addition to B'lack Week and
other events, BAS also publishes a
journal six times a year, according
to Savona Bailey, chairperson of
the publication.

The journal focuses on campus
news, national and international
news. It also has an editorial page.
Another column, entitled “FYI,"
publishes class papers by students
about different Afro—American his-
tories and accomplishments.

The journal, which has a circu-
lation of’500, is open to any student
who wishes to write.

Dear Editor:

This letter is in reference to
the article written about the Pitt
student participation in the
Great Race, “Students Battle

The writer interviewed a
versity members who partici-
pated in the race and most of
to one Pitt
athletic team or another. How-
ever, one Pitt student who
escaped the roving reporter's
eye placed 5th in the women’s
division with a time of 37:19
only four seconds behind the
women's 4th place finisher
(who just so happened to be last
year’s women's division
winner). - 2

Kathy Budway, a member of
the much ignored Lady Panth-
ers cross country team, certainly
deserves some congratulatory

performance. After all, she was
the Pitt student who came clos-
est to bringing home the
trophy.

So congratulations to Kathy,
another Pitt athlete of whom
the university and its women's
cross country team can be
proud.

Dormitories

Many of the founders of the uni-
versity set the stage for its future
growth and development. It is after

_ these influential people that we have

named our dormitories, but their
influence can be felt in every aspect
of university life.

Amos Hall, which now holds the A

sorority suites, was named after
Thyrsa W. Amos, who was the uni-
versity’s first Dean of Women.
Amos was born in Frankfort, Indi-
ana and graduated from Fairmount
College in Witchita, Kansas. She
was in charge of extracurricular
leadership and coordination of all
university interests outside the
classroom for women students. She
served the university until her death
in 1941. ‘

Amos was‘ a member of the
National Honorary Academic
Society, Pi Lambda Theta and presi-
dent of the National Association of
Deans of Women. She implemented
student government and wrote the
rituals for theMortarboard cerem-
ony, Coronation and Lantern Night,
which is still a Pitt tradition.

Brackenridge Hall was named
after Hugh Henry Brackenridge,
who founded the Pittsburgh’
Academy, which later becamethe
University of Pittsburgh. He also
started the Pittsburgh Gazette, the
first newspaper in the city of Pitts-
burgh, and wrote the state’s first
romantic novel, “Modern Chilvary.”

It was after the birth of his son,
Henry Marie, that Brackenridge
pleaded with the local government
to set up the Pittsburgh Academy.
On Sept. 10, 1787 the state legisla-
ture, of which Brackenridge was a
member, granted the sale of 5,000

acres to the Academy. But this land, ‘

located in Allegheny, was later
broken up and sold to other
investors.

A Penn gift in the form of a land
deed in 1787 finally made the Pitts-
burgh Academy a reality. Bracken-
ridge believed that the people of
Pittsburgh deserved an Academy
because of their service to the state
during the Revolution and that the
state would benefit from a school of
higher learning by producing heroes
to govern the state.

Another building in the Schenley
Quadrangle, Bruce Hall, was dedi-
cated to Robert Bruce, who in 1820
was the first principal of the West-
ern University of Pennsylvania,
which in 1907 became the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. He was born in
Perthshire, Scotland, Feb. 20, 1778
and was a graduate of Edinburgh.

Reverend Bruce was the pastorcof
the First Associate (United) Presby-
terian Church of Pittsburgh. He also
taught at Western University and
was described as the “most learned,
most sincere, most kindly man
we’ve ever met” by his fellow
teachers. During his lectures, his
students could divert the conversa-
tion at any time by asking a question
about Scottish history. He taught
mechanics, natural philosophy and
chemistry.

Bruce was the first person to ever
propose an addition of a medical col-
lege in Pittsburgh but it did not

becbme 21 reality for seventy years.

Towers, the largest dormitory
complex at Pitt, were dedicated to
Dr. Edward Litchfield, who was the
university’s twelfth chancellor and is
said to have given Pitt its cosmopoli-
tan style. He was born April 12, 1914
in Detroit, Michigan and attended
the University of Michigan. He
received his Ph.D. in political
science when he was 26 and at the
age of 31 was sent to Germany by
General Lucius D. Clay to re-
establish German political unity.

He was the former dean of Cor-

Tribute to A Financier

Although the Hillman family is
well known in Pittsburgh, Hil-
lman Library was named in
honor of one man: John Hartwell
Hillman, Jr., who was said to be
Pittsburgh’s number two finan-
cial power.

He built a business empire in
coal, natural gas, steel, banking
and real estate. He served as _
director of 35 banks, steel com-
panies and other corporations,
and was president of 14 of them.

Hillman was said to be came-
raphobic. He stayed well out of
view of the public eye. Little is
recorded about him, except that
he was born at Trigg Furnace,
Trigg County, Kentucky, on
April 27, 1880. Before dying at
the age of 79, he established the

Hillman Foundation, which con-
tributes to various chartablé
organizations.

It was the Hillman Foundation
which donated $3 million toward
the construction of Pitt’s first
seperate library facility, which
was opened in 1968. It had
owned the plot of land where Hil-
lman Library stands today, and
held onto it, so that it could be
donated for a building which
would benefit and beautify the
civic center of Oakland.
Although students may not
appreciate Hillman library
because of the time they spend
studying there, it carries out the
purpose of the Hillman founda-
tion quite well.

Remembering OurAthletes I

Pitt -sports fans may be concen-
trating on the football team right
now, but two of Pitt’s former ath-
letes will always be remembered.
Joe Trees and Lou Mervis are two
alumni whose memories live on in

L the buildings named after them.

Joseph Clifton Trees graduated
from Pitt, then called Western Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, with an
engeneering degree in 1896. At the
time, he was a star player on the
baseball team, but he was later to
become a pioneer in the production
of oil and gas in Lousiana.

In 1910, Trees donated $100,000
to the university for a much—needed
gymnasium and field. When Trees
Hall was built in the early ’60s, it was
named in honor of this great
industrialist.‘

Trees gymnasium and field were
originally constructed where Vete-
ran’s Hospital stands today. In his
dedication speech, Trees said “the
gymnasium and field were given to
the university, first, because I love
‘Old U.P.,’ second, because at the
time I felt after talking with Dr.
McCormick and others, that of all

the crying needs, it was the one
most pressing, and last, because I
wanted in some substantial manner
to pay part of the debt I owe her. If
the gym fills the need and does some
part in the development and making
of better young men and women, it
is money well spent.”

Trees went on to say that he felt
much of his success was due to the
training he recived at Pitt, both in
the classroom and on the athletic
field.

“Personally, I feel toward the uni-
versity much as a child to a parent
and that I owe her something I can
never fully repay,” he said.

Trees was born in Westmoreland
County in 1869; At the age'of 15, he
was the chief support of his family.
He married Claudine Willison imme-
diately after graduating from col-
lege, but their early years were a
struggle. .

After drilling nine completely dry
oil holes in West Virginia he struck
on the tenth try. From then on, his
fortune grew until, at the time on his
death in 1943 he was president of

several oil companies. and a
millionaire. ,

Like Trees, Lou Mervis was very
much involved in Pitt athletics. As a
pre-1920 Pitt football star, Mervis
played under coaches Pop Warner
and Andy Kerr from 1917 to 1919.
He is supposed to have narrowly
missed receiving All-America
honors because another tackle hap-
pened to be wearing his jersey on
the day Walter Camp, father of the
All-America idea was scouting at
Pitt.

Mervis and his wife Myra estab-

I lished a trust fund valued at $2 mil-

lion for Pitt’s Graduate School of
Business. In 1972, Pitt named its
social sciences building the Lou and
Myra G. Mervis Hall.

Mervis was born in 1898 in Union-
town, Pa., but he grew up in Brad-
dock. He entered Pitt in 1917 as a
business administration major. Dur-
ing his career, he owned and oper-
ated a number of industrial plants
around the country. Eventually, he
and his wife retired to Florida.

  Tennis Team Finds

’ W Virginia Too Much

1:‘

By SCOTT DELLETT

“This is the greatest match in
Lady Panther tennis history,”
George Dieffenbach said after yes-
terday’s match with West Virginia.

Usually a coach considers a
match great when his team
achieves a major victory or a team
member reaches a milestone. But
after a loss?

Looking closely at Pitt’s 6-3 loss
to West Virginia yesterday, some
answers may be found.

First, West Virginia offers sch_o-
larships to their players-_—P1tt
doesn't. The Lady Mountaineers
are considered one of the top tennis
squads in the area. Pitt’s 1-9 record
last year speaks for itself.

West Virginia defended Pitt 8-1
last year.

But, yesterday Pitt came within a
doubles match of upsetting West
Virginia. The Lady Panthers split
three singles matches as No. 1
player Cathy Jacobson defeated
Maureen Druga in straight sets 6-3,
6-4.

No. 4 seed Linda Stadler beat
Lindy Warrell 6-0, 6-4 while Jodi
Levine won in straight sets over
Leslie Ferrell 6--1, 7-6.

Mountaineer Lisa Grimes
defeated Pitt’s No. 2 seed Lisa
Lafuria 6-2, 6-3, Lady Panther
Miriam Goltz lost to Lori Burdell

/ \

6—2,6-2 and West Virginia’s Carrie
Gilson defeated Kris Peckman 6-
0,6-3. At this point, the score was
knotted at three entering the dou-
bles competition.

However, the same success didn’t
last through doubles. First, Goltz
and Levine were handled easily by
Grimes and Gilson 6-3, 6-3. Then
Stadler and Jody Mattioli lost a
tough three-set match to Ferrill
and Reaudup 4-6, 6-1, 6-1.

Drugaand Burdell closed the
match by defeating Pitt’s No. 1

doubles team of Jacobson and’

Lafuria 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.

The end result may be deceiving,
the outcome was already "decided
and the cold, dusk conditions
didn’t make fo-r ideal tennis
playing.

Dieffenbach said most of the
team goals were accomplished.

“We wanted to win the match, be
competitive and learn something
from this match,” he said. “Even
though we didn’t win, it was a
good learning experience for the
team.”

West Virginia used the lob to
their advantage as the Lady Panth-
ers continuously smashed over-
hand shots into the net.

“West Virginia hit some good
lobs at us,” Dieffenbach said. “The
errors that we had were forced by
them.”

The Lady Panther tennis team put forth a strong effort vesterday, despite losing to

West Virginia.

As usual, the West Virginia-Pitt
rivalry produced some controversy.
After Stadler and Mattioli lost the
second set of their doubles, they
asked for, and were granted, line
judges for the deciding third set.

The request stemmed from an
earlier line call by the Mountai-
neers. '_

But Dieffenbach dismissed the
controversy, saying, “West Virgi-
nia won it in the third set. They
have a real strong team;”

Dieffenbach was surprised at the

Panthers’ success, both as a team
and as individuals.

“I expected to have a winning
record, but I didn’t think we would
be 7-1,” Dieffenbach said. “Eve-

'ryone on the team has been a sur-

prise. We had 100 percent
improvement thanks to hard work
and spirit.”

With this momentum, Dieffen-
bach sees a bright future for the
Lady Panthers, especially upon
entrance into the Big East Tourna-
ment.

Houston photo

“I would like to finish in the
upper half,” Dieffenbach said. “A
fourth place finish or better would
be nice.” 1

Maybe it was appropriate to have
the greatest match ever yesterday.
Athletic director Edward Bozik and
associate athletic director Dean Bil-
lick both attended. This could be a
sign that Lady Panther tennis, as
well as non-revenue sports in gen-
eral, are ready to hit the national

Worn Out

By BARRY ZASLOFF

Dan Marino ripped apart his
helmet strap in disgust. Foge
Fazio paced the Pitt sideline at a
clip that suggested he was pre-
paring for The Great Race. The
West Virginia fans in attend-
ance acted like a 10-year-old
eyeing a box of candy. The rum-
blings of those back in Morgan-
town were almost audible this
side of Interstate 79.

the fourth quarter.

Then, there were the Pitt
fans. No journey for them, just
a series of boos shot toward
Marino and the offense.

The All-America quarter-
back, the Heisman Trophy can-
didate, the passing attack said
to be the finest in college foot-
ball and the running game that
was expected to cover ground
like a Greyhound darting across
an open field, was again failing
miserably.

No surprise, that chorus of
boos. Not in a city that often
jeers Terry Bradshaw, who has
led the Steelers to four Super
Bowl championships. Willie
Stargell was booed, the year
before he shared the National
League's MVP award with St.
Louis first baseman Keith
Hernandez.

Hell, this city would boo the
Tooth Fairy if she forgot a
molar.

"ll

11:» «raauv -x-‘gut 'J'g.>V ",d.u€«-" ‘~I"uv's!<""-'u‘¢'-.-“ "‘?‘3e.g'~'

It was then that Marino
began drilling the Mountai-
neers. Two scoring drives, in
which he tossed a succession of
complete passes, put the Panth-
ers‘ ahead 14-13. The boos
turned to cheers as rapidly as
Marino moved Pitt down field.

He was speaking from per-
sonal experience. Last January,
Marino became the darling of
Pittsburgh, having climaxed a
Sugar Bowl victory with
nothing short of a miraculous
drive, featuring that long’
touchdown pass to tight end
John Brown. Now, less than
nine months later, they had the
noose secured.

But while some screamed
choke, Marino and the offense
found itself in time to loosen

-the rope. The offense, which

had sputtered all day, all season
for that matter, began playing
to the expectations of the
onlookers. For 15 minutes,
Marino resembled a Heisman
Trophy candidate. For perhaps
the first time this year, the
Panthers looked like a national
champion.

A question begs for an
answer: Why, in four games
now, has it taken Marino and

1‘_‘\e.‘a ~_.—._",,4 - .‘~‘_..v

the offense at least half the game
to discover the right track? In
two games—North Carolina
and West Virginia-—Pitt failed
to score in the first half.

After the West Virginia con-
test, Panther flanker Dwight
Collins offered an explanation,
saying, “We've been watching
these teams’ defense on films
during the week, but they come
out and show us something
different. 

“At halftime,” Collins said,

0 At times, Marino has

the ball into crowds of defend-
ers, seemingly ignoring the
open receivers. At times, receiv-
ers have turned opposite the
path of the pass, as if it were a
ball of fire;

Thomas—who raced through
gaping holes last year for over
1000 yards—has had little suc-

season.

Alas, an unreasonable theory
considering the following:

aware that the opposition will
bring forth new defensive tac-
tics against a superior oppo-
nent. If not at season's start,
definitely by the West Virginia
game;

0 If the hypotheses were cor-
rect, upsets in college football
would take place at a faster pace

Dan Marino

than Fazio was setting on the
sideline;

0 Any combination of the
above two.

Why, then, does the offense
treat the first half like a practice
session? Perhaps the answer lies
on the opposite sideline, where
zealous opponents view Pitt as a
stepping-stone for national
acclaim. The opposition’s
defense has exited the locker
room more emotional than the
Pitt offense.

All of which explains Pitt’s
dominance late in the game. By
the fourth quarter, Panther foes
have worn to a halt-—physically
and emotionally. Pitt, it has

getting teased because I was a
woman and just got teased
because I was a trainer,” she
said. It took a while, but Wins-
low is now consideredjust “one
of the guys.”

“At first, the guys were
amazed that I could tape,” she
said, “but once they got used to
my face, I was just another
trainer.”

Humorous situations often
occur because of her presence in
the training room.

“It is a rule that there is no
nudity in the training room,
but some of the guys still

forget,” she said. “When the.

guys step out of the whirlpool
without a towel, Ijust turn my
head and pretend that I don’t
see anything. Some just forget
I’m there.”

Training football is more
demanding than training any
other sport. “Employers always
want to see football expe-
rience,” Winslow said.

She considers each day a
learning experience.

“The hurried-up atmosphere
is really good training. I just
enjoy sitting back and watching
Fran (Feld) and Kip (Smith)
work. I like to note their style
and incorporate it into my

)1

OWTI.

Last year, Winslow had the
opportunity to train for the
Lady Panther track team. There
she handled all the responsibili-
ties of a head trainer. Although
her football responsibilities are
not as heavy, she has no regrets.

“I don't regret not having any
evaluating responsibilities that
you can have with a smaller
team because each day is a
learning experience,” she said..

Former coach Jackie Sherrill
would have no women in the
locker with him.

» “We have Foge to thank for
the change in policy,” Winslow
said. “Without his OK, having
women in the training room
would still be animpossibility.
Now there will always be at
least one female assigned to
football each semester.”

Training for the Panthers
does carry ample amount of
prestige. “It’s great to call home
and say, ‘Hey mom, I'm going
to be on TV this Saturday.’ "

But along with the fun, a
serious attitude must be
maintained.

“I have to maintain a more
professional attitude with the
football team because now I'm
in the public spotlight," she
said.

Winslow has high regards for
the coach who was responsible

' for her position.

“One day Coach Fazio called
me aside and apologized for the
incredibly profane language
which is used up at practice. I
thought, ‘Why is he worrying
about me and if I was embar-
rassed? He has a championship
team to worry about!’ Right
then, he shot to No. l in my
book.”

Winslow, 21, hails from the
city of Cleveland, Ohio, where
she was an excellent athlete, let-
tering in basketball, volleyball
and softball. She first heard
about sports medicine in sev-
enth grade, but was told that all
female trainers were permitted
to do was “wash socks."

It may take a while to work
out all the kinks of having a
female present in the stadium
training room, but if anyone
can su(‘(‘essfully steer this pilot
program, it’s Laura Winslow.

Casey

By LISA GRENEVICKI

Brian Casey mentioned the old
cliche, “playing like _a freshman”
when describing his play on this
year’s Pitt soccer team. It’s ironic
though, because as a freshman star-
ter for the Panthers, Casey is play-
ing more like an experienced
senior.

Casey hails from Virginia and is
a graduate of Yorktown High
School in Arlington. There Casey.
distinguished himself as a fine’
soccer player, gaining ,All-
Metropolitan by the Washington
Post and, most recently, being
awarded the 1982 Arlington High
School Boy’s Soccer Sportsman-
ship Award.

Now Casey is continuing his fine
soccer play for Pitt. He is one of

several freshmen who have won
starting positions from upperclass-
men.

“I didn’t expect to be playing as
much as I-have,” Casey said. “I
thought I'd be lucky to get a letter
and here I am starting and getting a
lot of playing time.’p’

Casey is a main fixture in the
Panther defense at the stopper
position. He did play center mid-
field in high school, but made the
switch to stopper, claiming he was
more defensive minded.

“Stopper is basically a defensive
role,” explained Casey. “It is my
job to mark the opponents’ first
offensive man who comes into our
defense. I play man to man most of
the time. On offense, I help with
the transition in the midfield and

Plays Like A Senior

the distribution of the ball,’’ he
said.

It would seem playing soccer
would be second nature to Casey--
he’s been playing since he was
seven years old. An avid partici-
pant in many sports, Casey says he
has always preferred soccer.

"I played baseball and football
and ran track, but I decided to stay
with soccer,” Casey said. “When it
came down to playing soccer or
another sport, I chose soccer.”

Along with Panther teammate
Mike Russell, Casey was a member
of the Arlington team, under
Coach John Ver Standig. The team
was the first junior team to play in
the Men’s Division of the Virginia
Semi-Pro League.

ooters To Face
Youngstown State

By_J|M COLLINS

If scoring wasn’t problem
enough, the Panthers now have
another one on their hands-
injuries. Two of the Pitt starters
will definitely miss tonight’s game
against Youngstown State and sev-
eral others will be playing hurt.

The Bucknell game took its toll
on stopper Brian Casey and
sweeper Mike Russell. Casey has a
bruised hip while Russell is miss-
ing his second game with tendoni-
tis. Coach Leo Bemis plans on
replacing them with sophomore
Jeff Dunn and senior Tom Trem-
pus. Both have played the posi-
tions before and will maintain the
stability of the defense.

Youngstown State enters Pitt
Stadium with a much improved
team. The Eagles are coming off a
6-0 victory over Alliance College, a
team they only beat by one goal a

year ago. Youngstown played
evenly with the Panthers in last
year’s contest. Pitt eventually won
4-1, but the score was deceiving,
according to Bemis.

“You can't take a team like
Youngstown lightly,” Bemis said.
“The nucleus of the team is return-
ing, which should make for a good
game."

Although Pitt lost to Bucknell
2-0 on Saturday, Bemis was pleased
with their performance. More pres-
sure was put on the offense during
practice, which he believes helped
the Panthers play tough against
Bucknell. For Youngstown State,
Bemis has the team practicing give-
and-go’s and quick-ball
movement.

“If we take from where we left off
on Saturday, we should put a few
balls in the net,” Bemis said.

With nine games remaining on
their schedule, the Panthers’ record
stands at 3-7.

k Poetic Reflections on NFL Players’ Strike 

A disorder has crippled our town’s favorite sport The Pitt Panther passer, one Danny Marino,
And football just -isn’t the same, Leads Foge toward a national title.

To the vendors who sell at the game. Came last weekend when Pittsburgh was idle.

The devious methods the pollsters have practiced
Have made second-guessing absurd.
Though the Panthers defeat all the nation’s elite,
The major polls drop them to third.

The fans have been thrown from their cozy recliners;
For them this damn strike has been hell.
But some have extracted some good from their plight:

Collier posted yet another win last
night as he continues to juggle a
lineup consisting of young talent.

The Lady Panther volleyball
team traveled to Edinboro State
and defeated the host squad by 15-
9,16-18,15-6,15-11.

Collier raised Pitt's overall
match record to 24-3 using only a
seven-player squad. In addition to
Ulana Kohut.iak’s continued reha-
biliation, Judy Young, Robin
Kukalis and captain Julie Gaul sat
out due to injuries and other
commitments.

The replacements performed
with surprising efficiency. Collier
emphasized the adversities under
which his squad played last
evening.

“The freshmen had to take over
leadership roles and it was good for

and Carmen Tapia. Previously red-
shirted Ellen Mangus also contrib-
uted in last night’s victory.

Collier praised the freshmen’s
potent production. “They are
holding up real well. We have
tough kids who have fought back
in the past and with injuries; these
are people hanging in there.”

It was not, however, accomp-
lished without the rallying gui-
dance of senior Diane Zack. “It
took some really confident leader-
ship from a person like Diane to
pull the troops together,” Collier
said. ’

There will be the need for this
type of sustained competitive bal-
ance to ready the team for the up-
and-coming Big East Champion-
ships and, ultimately, the NCAAs.

“Even though we are fighting

us through the tight games.”

Collier finds the combination of
maintaining his winning ways by
“pacing his players.” It will take
timely rest and relaxation by a
sleight of hand.

He added, “With the kinds of
players winning now, they will be
ready when the regulars get back.
One of our goals now is the gearing
to win and readying for the Big
Easts.”

Amidst all the glaring detri-
ments Collier is currently endur-

ing, there is still a small ray of

consolation poking through.

“It is very satisfying to keep on
winning despite playing freshmen.
The team has continued to rally
and play well. This is quite encou-
raging to me.”

“Arlington is a good team and a
lot of players come to tryout."
Casey said. “At the county level in
Virginia, there are more people.
both men and women, participat-
ing in soccer than ever before."

Although accustomed to the
high level of skill of team play,

lasey said it was a big switch from
high school to college soccer.

“It's tough starting out on a col-
lege team," Casey said. “Besides
the nervousness, you have to get
used to the college style of play.
You don't realize how different it is
until you play.

“College soccer is faster, more
powerful and more aggressive," he
continued. “It’s a game played
with speed and precision. Also you
have no idea how the opposing
teams play and what they have
when you’re a freshman. You have
to learn about your competition.”

Perhaps that’s the problem the
Pitt booters are having. At a disap-
pointing 3-8, the Panthers are play-
ing well, but they're having a
tough time finding a scoring
punch. Casey believes the Panthers
difficulties might be the result of
both the offense and defense.

“We’ve been competitive and
we’re playing our best, but we’re
lacking at times," explained Casey.
“Part of it is mental lapse. On
defense we have a mental lapse, we

lose our man and let him score, ‘

causing pressure for the offense to
score. We need to concentrate
more. - .

“On offense, we’re having a hard
time working the ball. We’re get-
ting a man open, but we’re not get-
ting the ball to our scorers at the
right time,” he added.

The Panthers will be out to put a
couple wins under their belts this
week. But they may be without the
services of,Casey.

In the Bucknell game last Satur-
day, Casey went up for a- head ball
and came down hard on his left leg.
As a result, he suffered a twisted
muscle of the hip. Casey will miss
at least one game, but he is hopeful

’ of getting back in the line-up soon.

“We’re going to try and finish
with a winning season,” Casey
said. “We want to pull out some
big wins and a few upsets. I would
like to stop my opponents scorers
more and play a good game both
defensively and offensively.”

The Pitt booters will be looking
forward to getting Casey back in
the line-up and to have him “play-
ing like a freshman” once again.
