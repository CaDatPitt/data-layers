“Animal Friends seeks homes for abandoned pets

By Laurie Lehosky
Staff Writer

Picture this. They are brother
and sister, several years old and
abandoned due to a household
which broke up recently. Their
names are Herbie and Frannie:
two basset hounds that are
patiently waiting for a new home
and lots of love.

In the meantime, Animal
Friends Inc., a shelter without a
time limit that is located on Penn
Avenue in the Strip District, has
opened its doors to Herbie and
Frannie until a permanent home
can be found for them. They
have been with Animal Friends
Inc. for approximately two weeks
now. Herbie and Frannie’s story
is just one of Animal Friends
Inc.’s many stories of dogs and
cats also waiting for a home.

Animal Friends Inc. stepped
into the spotlight from Feb. 8-14,
1990, at Kaufmann’s Department
Store in association with the
store’s Valentine ’s Day promotion
called “The Gift of Love.” Each
day, with the exception of Sunday,
volunteers of Animal Friends Inc.
have been in the downtown store
answering questions about the
shelter, adopting and
volunteering. Each day different
dogs and cats were brought in to
be viewed and adored by
customers.

From the exhibit booth at
Kaufmann’s, Animal Friends Inc.
has received publicity from three
radio stations and two television
shows such as WAMO 105.9 FM
and Channel 4’s “Pittsburgh's
Talking”.

This central Pittsburgh animal

,3, shelter holds approximately 120

dogs and cats, according to
Marlene Cornelius, a volunteer
for nine years. Last year
approximately 1,200 animals were
adopted, but the actual number
varies from month to month, said
Cornelius. Since the shelter does
not receive any money from the
government, it relies on the help
of the volunteers and donations.
Cornelius said, “It is almost like
you are trying to sell something.
“If anyone has any
misconceptions about the shelter,
the animals are not committed to
a caged-in atmosphere. The
animals are walked and bathed
regularly. They receive much love
and attention from our
volunteers,” said Cornelius. A
Every June and September,
Animal Friends Inc. holds a picnic
in North Park for the animals.
“It's simply a change of
atmosphere,” said Cornelius.
Animal Friends Inc. is always
looking for volunteers. The
qualifications for becoming a
volunteer are that the individual
be at least 16 years old and work
a minimum of four hours a month.
First, the volunteer must attend
an orientation session, then
choose a job such as dog walking,

obedience training, bathing and ,

grooming, cat care, fund raising
or adoption counseling.
Cornelius added, “We are
always looking for volunteers.
We don’t have enough.”
Annette Blum, a volunteer,
said,” My husband and I always
loved animals. We have four cats,
so I decided to volunteer.
Volunteers can foster animals until
the shelter has room or until the
animal is adopted. I took home a
miniature pinscher and two days

later we adopted him. We fell in
love and ended up keeping it.”

Another volunteer, Ruth Ayres,
spends approximately 10 to 15
hours a week at the shelter. She
specializes in dog walking and
obedience. Ayres says she walks
about 12 to 18 dogs a day.

“I volunteered because I’ve had
much experience with dogs, and
I feel there are too many homeless
dogs in the world,” said Ayres.

She added, “When we find a
permanent home for the animal
[and] a problem arises, the shelter
will always take them back.”

According to Cornelius, the
adoption process can take
anywhere from half an hour to
one and a half hours. The
adoption counselors allow the
people to escort the animal or to

.be in a room with the animal

while the adoption counselors
make all the necessary calls.

“We encourage the person
adopting the animal to ask many
questions. We are more interested
in quality placement,” said
Cornelius.

Animal Friends Inc. is also
involved in pet therapy. The

volunteers take the cats and dogs
to institutions for the sick and the
elderly, said Cornelius.

According to Cornelius, most C

people who come to the shelter
to adopt want an animal that is
cute, ﬂuffy and small.

“It is very difficult for an animal

emotionally to leave and then‘

come back to the shelter,” added
Cornelius.

“If you tell someone that a dog
is five years old, they back off.
What they don’t realize is that this
dog is already house trained and
is just as affectionate as a puppy.”

Organization molds future leaders

Christopher McCall
Staff Writer

The future student leaders of
Pitt who are participating in the
Emerging Leaders Organization
are over the hump with their
projects.

“The program is dedicated to
teaching freshmen leadership and
communication skills. It does so
by pointing out an individual’s
strengths and weaknesses
through close and constant work
with peers on a common theme
and by students’ reactions to their
projects,” said Joyce Giangarlo,
associate director of activities.

The first 200 freshmen to sign
up in August comprise the group.
They then meet on Wednesday
nights and work together in
groups of 15 on one project
throughout the year. ‘Each group
is led by a graduate student.

“They design a project [directed

mainly] toward Pitt students. It is
some project that they contrived
themselves, and each member of
the group assumes a responsible
role in completing theproject,”
said Giangarlo.

The project’s success is then
evaluated by the participants.

“We have the group [members]
set their own goals, work together
as a team toward those goals, and
then they evaluate themselves
and see if their project worked,”
said Giangarlo.

“Last year, one group went far
and above what typically works
at Pitt. They wanted to have a lip-
synch contest. They did all of
their own advertising, but nobody
would sign up for it. Then, during
their evaluation, they realized that
the contest would’ve worked in
high school, but not at Pitt. But
that’s an important lesson in
leadership; you understand what
it's like when somebody doesn’t

 

do what you expected,” she said.

Three of the groups this year
are working together on a comedy
night. Since they can’t afford all
of the necessary equipment and
advertising, they’ve established a
co—sponsorship with the Pitt
Program Council.

Erin Rodgers, vice president of
the freshman council, described
her groups’ plans for the comedy
night. “We hope to have an
established comedian and also
an amateur night kind of thing
with monetary awards for
participating students.”

Freshman Neil Robertson, who
was involved with his high
school’s student government, has
learned “how to avoid getting
stressed out once I get to a
leadership position. We’ve been
dealing with stress management
a lot, but each week it's different;
last week we dealt with ethics.”

Teach Your Children Well

Local parents recently urged Pennsylvania state
officials to establish guidelines thatwould dis-
courage school districts from segregating handi-
capped students in special-education centers.

Joann Herzberger and Debbie Efkeman, both moth-
ers of Down’s syndrome children, stated that 42
percent of the educable mentally retarded in subur-
ban Allegheny County arc taught in special—educa—
tion centers, not regular classrooms.

Efkeman made a good point when she further
iterated that pupils without handicaps would be
more accepting of the mentally retarded if they
attended classes together.

However, desegregating mentally disabled chil-
dren by placing them in regular classrooms would
only hinder learning for both mentally and non-
mentally disabled children.

Unlike special-education teachers, teachers of

‘students in regular classrooms‘ have not been trained
to adequately teach the mentally disabled. To ex-
pect them to do so would only be counterproductive
in catering to the needs of the mentally handi-
capped. . ' ~

Furthermore, there is hardly any doubt that teach-
ers ‘in the regular classrooms would be forced to
divert classroom learning time to the attention of
the much slower, severely mentally handicapped
students, surely at the expense of the advanced,
non-disabled students.

Although a desegregated setting would open the
eyes and minds of young, pupils to the distressing
plight of the mentally handicapped, it would hardly
increase the children’s ability to learn. But we
should make! sure that mentally handicapped stu-
dents who are capable of functioning in a desegre-
gated setting should be permitted to do so.

Let’s do our best to teach our children the basics,
but let's also take time to teach them to understand
that there are other unfortunate children who can't
learn the basics quite as easily. I

On the freedom of speech. ..

In response to an article in the Tuesday, February
13 issue of The Pitt News, Charles Greve and Co.
Real Estate has placed an advertisement in today's
issue that decries the statements presented in the
article. We would like it to be known that this is a
paid advertisement and that The Pitt News does not
provide free advertisement space for rebuttals. We
do agree, however, that Greve has every right to

‘place this paid rebuttal, as well as submit a letter

to the editor, in the name of free speech and fair
comment.

But the staff of The Pitt Newswould like it to be
known that it stands behind the statements and
facts attributed in that article. In no way is the
placing of this ad an admission of wrongful state-
ments or misleading information on the part of The
Pitt News, and we have no personal grievances with
the Greve Co. or any other Oakland landlord. Should
a story worthy of print arise, this newspaper will
print that story, in full, with all proper facts and
attributions, and will not be swayed by opinion or
comments of those involved.

All I need is a ride to Scranton!

President’s Day weekend is
upon us, and for some of us this
means an opportunity to go home
and bring back all of those im-
portant essentials for spring
break. For others, it’s a much-

1 needed chance to catch up on all
those assignments or chores or
errands that the usual seven-day
week doesn't permit us to com-
plete. Still others travel to scenic
locales to visit friends. And some
of us just sit around and rot
because we cannot do any of the
above. -

Like me, for instance. I would
like to go to Scranton this week-
end. No, really! I've got an ex-
girlfriend up there, and I'd like to

__pay her a visit, seeing as how we
are still friends. (No, really!) But
this won’t happen because of
politics. “

I do not have a driver's license
(It's a long story). Bus fares

nowadays are nothing short of

highway robbery, and I am not
old enough to rent a car. Fortu-
nately for me, I found some
people going to Scranton
(strangely enough, each of them
was also hoping to see his ex-
girlfriend). Unfortunately, none
of them were old enough to rent
a car, either.

Herein lies my problem. Soci-
ety has goofed up again. This
time, the issue is car insurance.

Some research types decided
that people between the ages of

16 and 25 are in more accidents
than other people. Whether or
not this is true, the fact remains
that my weekend is going to be
ruined because of these people.

 

Wechsler

Car- insurance rates for people
within this age bracket have gone

through the roof. Rental compa-.

nies understandably do not want
to pay these‘ exorbitant fees and
therefore set age requirements
above the “danger zone.” They
are in the business to make
money, not lose it.

But, what about the little guy?
There are an awful lot of respon-
sible people in the so-called
“danger zone" that are suffering
because of‘ this unfair treatment
(most of them, presumably, have
ex-girlfriends in Scranton). They
cannot rent cars because of those

statistics. The analysts blame the
“danger-zone” effect on the in-
experience and/or irresponsibil-
ity of drivers in this ageqbracket.

Well then, let us consider this:
if the problem is the driver, why
not put the burden of liability
upon the driver? The whole idea
of insuring a car (or anything
else, for that matter) is ridiculous!
If a car is totaled, so what? As Jay
Leno might say, “Crunch all you
want- We’ll make more.” The
same is true of other valuables.

And who is going to finance this .

replacement? Not the car, that's
for sure. The driver will.

So, insure the driver. Put all of
the ﬁnancial red tape and head-
ache on the driver’s shoulders.
That ought to cause a drop in
irresponsible drivers! And “inex-
perienced” is a poor excuse to
begin with. Accidents will hap-
pen regardless of age. Insurance
should likewise be indiscrimina-
tory. Then, car- rental agencies
would be able to rent to all
licensed drivers. Their business
would expand, and people like
me wouldn’t have these ridicu-
lous travel problems.

Speaking of which, can any-

,body give me a lift? I can leave as

early as today and need not re-
turn until Sunday. I’ll pay your
gas and tolls. You can contact me
C/O this paper. Really.

The Pitt News.

Graduation date perfectly fine

As a Point Park College student
preparing to graduate April 29, I
felt I should express my concern
over the University of Pittsbu rgh’s
recent graduation-date contro-
versy. Why should I be con-
cerned about Pitt’s graduation
date? Because my twin sister was
scheduled to graduate from Pitt
on the same date at approxi-
mately the same time.

If this sounds like a selfish
reason to be in favor the date
change, it’s not meant that way. I
just felt the offended students
should be aware that the change
is a good one for some people. I

wasn't looking forward to decid-

‘ ing which family members would

attend which ceremony. How-

Letters

ever, I also hadn't planned on
asking either college’s admini-
stration to make an exception for
one family.

In this case, the decision should
have been (and was) made con-
cerning what was best for the

majority of the students (not to
mention the Civic Arena’s sched-
uling conﬂict). If Pitt’s date had
remained the same, we would’ve
dealt with the problems. After
all, if I’ve learned one lesson in
four years at Point Park, it’s that
life isn’t always perfect.

Thanks for letting me express
my views as an outsider. Con-
gratulations,‘ University of Pitts-
burgh class of ’90! I’ll see you at
the Civic Arena on April 28.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Sean Hellman

Pittsburgh’s college soccer coaches have
discussed the possibility of a city-college
soccer tournament for the fall 1990 season.

The tournament would be played as a
preseason city championship between four
city schools to generate interest in local
soccer.

John Kowalski, head soccer coach at
Robert Morris, came up with the idea last
fall and approached Joe Luxbacher, head
coach at Pitt, and Nick Gaudioso, head

coach at Carnegie Mellon.

Although nothing is set, the coaches are
currently working on ﬁnalizing plans for
the tournament to be played as a scrimmage
in the upcoming season. Plans which still
need to be discussed include promotional
aspects, fitting it into each team’s schedule
and adding a fourth team.

Kowalski feels the tournament could
become an annual event.

“We would like to first start it as a
preseason tournament, and then develop
it into something bigger," said Kowalski.

“It’s not a bad idea,” said Luxbacher.

Possibility of city-wide soccer tournament discussed

Kowalski’s original idea was to include
the tournament in each team’s regular-
season schedule, but it is too late for the
schools to make schedule additions for
the upcoming season.

“Our schedule is set,” said Luxbacher.

“I'm pretty sure [our schedule is] locked, "
said CMU Coach Gaudioso, who also feels
the tournament is a good idea.

Kowalski has since mentioned the idea
of playing the tournament as a preseason
scrimmage. The college soccer season
runs from September through October.
The tournament would probably be played

 

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1990

around the first week in September.

“I talked with Nick [Gaudioso] and Joe
lLuxbacherl, and that’s basically what was
in mind,” said Kowalski.

He said the main problem Kowalski has
encountered is finding a fourth team.

Point Park College was in Kowalski’s
original plans, but its soccer program has

- had some problems.

Point Park reinstituted soccer as a varsity
sport last season. It was the ﬁrst time since
1975 Point Park has fielded a team. It
posted a 0-10 record in 1989, and head

Shorter at top of Big East's

Brian Shorter is rising above his Big East peers.

Brian Kubiak/I‘ he Pitt News

class in scoring, rebounds

By Geoff Moskowitz
Staff Writer

Brian Shorter had a stone-cold look of
disappointment on his face after Pitt’s
loss to U.Conn. Tuesday night. He seemed
frustrated and irritable answering the
media’s post-game questions.

justifiably so. Shorter had just spent 40
minutes out-rebounding and out-scoring
the entire ﬂoor; except for Nadav

: Henefeld, who was able to match
 Shorter’s 27 points. But no one was able

to top Shorter’s- 14 rebounds. Rob Sellars’
six boards were the closest anyone came
to Shorter’s dominance of the glass.

Tuesday’s performance was nothing
new for Shorter. He has been Pitt’s high
scorer in 13 games this season. Likewise,
Shorter has led the Panthers’ rebound
column 14 times.

Even more impressive, Shorter is
leading the Big East in scoring (464
points) for all games, and is second to
Georgetown’s Mark Tillmon in
conference play. Also, Shorter is third in
both rebounding (109) and ﬁe1d—goal
percentage (.527) in the Big East.

This is of little consolation to Shorter,
whose team has fallen to 4-7 in league
games, and 10-12 overall.

“We played our game, but our lack of
depth has hurt us,” said Shorter. “It

would be nice to get a two- or three-
minute rest during the game.”

Shorter did not show any signs of
fatigue against U.Conn. In fact, he scored
10 of his 27 points in the last eight
minutes of the game. His defense did not
suffer either. Rod Brookin was the only
other Panther who was as tenacious as
Shorter during the game.

Shorter knows that the Panthers can't
afford to look back. “We can’t quit right

now just because we lost. We’ve still got’

games to play. We have to keep our
heads up and hang on in there.”

The Panthers didn't have any trouble
hanging with Villanova (6-7, 14-12) in
their first meeting. Despite a Big East
record 15 three-point shots, the Panthers
shut down the Wildcats in the second
half to win 94-82.

Darren Morningstar’s ability to shut
down Tom Greis in the second half
overshadowed Shorter’s game high 27
points and 8 rebounds.

Morningstar scored 3 points in 8
minutes against U.Conn., and will need
to bounce back strong to help stop the
hot Villanova squad.

Nova is coming off its second huge
upset of Syracuse, and will have an extra
day's rest before hosting the Panthers
this Saturday.

Evans’ anger tactics not as eﬂectiz/e as other coac/oes’

Chaucer, no doubt, was sitting
in his chateau sipping an RC Cola
and watching a rabid college
basketball coach erupt during a
game on his big-screen television
when he came up with this one:
“Control thyself, those who
control others.”

Technical fouls, you see, can
be dangerous to your overall
health, or even worse, your team’s
NCAA tournament chances.

The easiest thing to do here
would be to blame Pitt head
coach Paul Evans’ back-to-back
technical fouls in the Panthers’
80-77 loss to revamped UConn
Tuesday night. Very easy.
Everyone knows that Evans likes

to freak out. Evans loves to freak
out. And that is good. A passive,
unernotional coach is similar to
having a pet mussel.

But one thing that explosive
coaches must have is an
intimidating reputation if they
are going to get away with that
sort of misbehavior, the kind of
reputation that scares referees,
dares them to send a “T” their
way, let alone ﬂowers.

Bobby Knight at Indiana has it.
So does Georgetown’s John
Thompson. And N.C. State's
Jimmy V, when certain gentlemen
are wearing the zebra outfits.

Paul Evans doesn’t have it And
that is bad.

 

Thomas
Danyluk

If Evans blows off the sideline
steam, seven times out of 10 he
and his team are going to get
penalized for it. What's important

for a guy like Evans is timing,
throwing tantrums at the right
time. Now, did Evans’ two
technicals (whether he deserved
them or not) which resulted in
eight Husky points, come at a
bad time for his team? Did Evans’
two technicals lose the game for
Pitt and thus jolt the Panthers out
of a last—gasp NCAA tournament
bid?

Radical fans may think so. But
they didn't. Pitt should have
beaten UConn Tuesday night.
And they didn't. Tbatis the bottom
line.

But have the Panthers really
been eliminated? Currently, the
team is 10-12. If they win their

five remaining games then take
two victories in the Big East post-
season tournament, they will
finish with the exact same record
as the 1988-89 team, 17-12. Which
is not really impossible. And if
they win the tournament outright,
an automatic red carpet is
stretched out at Pitt’s feet.

But will this year’s 17-12 cut it?

Never.-

Yes, recent NCAA invitee
history says that teams with
records as such can be and have
been invited. Pitt was last year
with 12 losses. In 1988, LSU
qualified at 16-13, while Maryland
qualiﬁed at 17-12. In 1987,

coach Rich Baxendell resigned at
the end of the season after it was
discovered he used ineligible
players.

Kowalski said he would like
the fourth team to be of city—wide
interest. “We wouldn't want
someone like Slippery Rock
playing for the city
championship.”

Kowalski said Penn State is a
possibility as the fourth team to
play for the Pittsburgh city
championship. There is plenty of
city interest in Penn State with

Georgia Tech snuck in at 16-12. DePaul did, too, with a 16-12
in 1986.

The difference between last year's Pitt and this year’s Pitt? Big
wins. Among the Panthers 17 victories last season were ones
over Florida, Syracuse (then No. 2 nationally), Oklahoma (then
No. 3), Seton Hall, twice (once at No. 9) and Georgetown (then
No. 2).

The team lost silly games to Siena, Duquesne, BC, West
Virginia and underachieving Connecticut, but so what? The
NCAA tournament committee saw enough big-game trophies
to do some serious overlooking.

This year, the Panthers’ biggest trophy has been Arizona,
then ranked a mere 19th nationally.

They have been beaten, so far, by N.C. State, Georgia Tech
(twice), West Virginia, Toledo, Syracuse (twice), Georgetown
(twice) and Connecticut (twice). Being dumped by Toledo
wasn’t quite resume material, either. Well, hey, any live guys
can lose those games. Nothing special there.

And that is the problem, not the technical fouls. On the .
basketball court, Pitt really hasn't been able to generate
anything special this season. There have been some close
games and near upsets, but close only counts in shaving, and
when you have instant replay to fall back on.

Close will get you to the NIT, which, when considering the
obstacles the team! faced all season long, ain’t all that bad,

people.

The Shroud: Pittsburgh's W()1‘1d domination regime

By Tim Azinger
Showcase Editor

“We're gonna take the planet!”
—The Shroud, “Take the
Planet” 2

They may not be ready to
overrun the entire planet, but the
Pittsburgh area, Pennsylvania and
even the entire continental United
States is a reasonable possibility.

Welcome to the upbeat
intonations and world-
domination scheme of The

Shroud.

The band in its original
incarnation started in November
of 1988 when Richard Schnap
(guitar, vocals), formerly of the
Cynics, and Greg Bloom (bass,
vocals), formerly of the Heretics,
matched their earlier musical
experiences. The first group
tended toward an almost metallic-
rock sound, something which
has gone by the wayside with the
advent of the new lineup.

6 “It’s absolutely a conscious

change,” says Bloom. “We were
sort of a metal band before. Some
of heavy metal is OK, and there
are some good players in it, but
basically, it’s not what we want to
do for a lot of idealistic reasons.
It’s too chauvinistic for one thing,
and [Rich and I] are strongly against
that. It’s also militaristic, and it’s
just not what we're going for.
There are a lot of good metal
bands in this town, but it’s not
what we want to do.” A

The lineup change occurred at
the beginning of the new year
and added Eric Pferdekamper
(lead guitar), , Pat Nightingale
(drums) and Heather Clark
(keyboard, vocals). ‘Clark
occasionally assisted on vocals
for earlier shows and was then
added as the keyboardist to
expand The Shroud’s sound.

“Heather worked with Greg at
the symphony doing
telemarketing, so he got to know
her,” says Schnap. “She originally
started guesting on a couple of
songs, and eventually she became

a full member. Pat was in from
Boston, and he put up signs on
telephone poles around town
wanting to gig with a band. Greg
saw it, so he gave Pat a call, and
we had our drummer.”

Musically, the new members
have enabled The Shroud to play
with a diversity that wasn’t present
before. “I think the latest lineup
change has enabled us to bring a
lot more musicality into the band, "
says Nightingale. “If someone asks
me what I think the band is, I say
we’re an original funk/pop band
with a hard—rock edge, which is a
pretty broad generalization, but
that sums up just about everything
we do with the exception of the
ballads.”

Each member has a personal
reason for performing music, but
Pferdekamper’s reaches a bit
deeper than a simple love for
music. “It was sort of a sexual
thing, actually,” he says. “My
girlfriend wasn’t giving it tome,

so I had a lot of extra time on my '/

hands.” [Laughs]

The ability to joke and freely
exchange ideas also lends to the
band's diversity. Even such a
simplistic characteristic as clothing
plays into The Shroud’s overall
image. While most of the

members take the stage in jeans
and T —shirts, Clark usually dons a
sensuous, form-ﬁtting dress.

   
   

Richard Schnap of The Shroud.

“I think it was natural," says
Clark, “because that’s what they
were comfortable wearing, but I
usually get dressed up. It’s not
trying to be exploitive of myself.
But I think visually it’s interesting,
because it accentuates the fact
that this isn’t a big, macho heavy-

metal band; there is a woman.
The [first] band was real macho,
so it was really interesting when
all of the sudden there was a
female on stage. It breaks that
macho image.”

But images don’t affect the
music, and that’s an important
factor for The Shroud.
Individuality is a must, but one
person's ideas can’t override.
“We’re real democratic,” says
Schnap. “I feel that each person
contributes something to the
band."

“Rich and I write most of the
songs, and we have ideas for the
arrangements,” Bloom adds, “but
we don’t crack the whip. Each

person is in charge of their own
instrument.”

Combining such individuality
with an A open-mindedness for
musical creation gives The Shroud
an edge musically, allowing them
to create songs ranging from hard
rock to synth-pop to love ballads.
The band has a plethora of
recordable material and has plans
for studio time in the near future,
as long as they aren't hampered
by difficulties.

“Money's a problem for us right
now," says Bloom, “but we’d like
to record enough material for an
album. That may take a long

time, so we may release a single,

It's really tough to get a single
played though.”

Album or not, The Shroud
funnels a great deal of their
energies into their music,
especially their live shows. Live
performances are often the
catalyst for groundbreaking
bands, but lack of public interest
usually proves to be a pitfall.

“There’s a lot of talent out
there,” says Pferdekamper. “But
Pittsburgh’s a conservative city;
what can you say? Unfortunately,
that conservatism that we got
from the post—industrial age of
Pittsburgh, and that sort of
attitude, has trickled down into
the [entertainment scenel.”

Regardless of , any
intrepidations, The Shroud
continue to produce quality,

Latifah: Queen of the rap kingdom

By Sekou Coleman
For The Pitt News

On Feb. 1, 1990, Pittsburgh’s
Underground Enterprises
sponsored the area’s ﬁrst rap
concert in several months. The
headline act was the controversial
Def jam/CBS group Public
Enemy. Among the others who
appeared at the reasonably
trouble-free concert were local
artists Hardcore, Cold Chillin’/
Warner Brothers artist Biz Markie
and Tommy Boy Records’ Queen
Latifah.

Latifah, the 19-year-old New
Jersey resident, has recently
released her debut record All
Hail the Queen. Among the songs
she performed at the concert were
“Ladies First” (her most recent
release and duet with British
rapper Monie Love), “Wrath of
My Madness” and “Dance for
Me.”

The crowd was very responsive
to her act, going into a wild
frenzy when she and her dancers,
the Safari Sisters 007 and 99, took
to the stage.

The following is from an
interview with Latifah after her
show.

Q: You had a good show. How
did you feel about it?

A: It was good. It was a real
good show.

Q: Are you on a long tour right
now?

A: Well, We’re doing spot dates
on Heavy D’s tour and [Big Daddy]
Kane’s tour. Biz [Markie] is on
that, [MC] Lyte is on it  the
Wrecks’n’Effect sometimes
Redhead Kingpin sometimes 
various other groups.

Q: After this where are you
going?

A: Home! (Laughs) I’m going
home tomorrow!

Q: I’d like to talk to you about
your album. It‘s got a lot of great,
diﬂerent sounds. What went into
putting it together? Did you have
the idea of what you wanted
before you started?

A: Pretty much. I didn’t want to
stick to one thing, ‘cause then, if
I wanted to do something
different, people would be used

to me doin’ that one thing, and it

would be hard for them to adjust.
So in order to avoid that, and just
because I wanted to, I just did
whatever came to mind.

stuﬁf as well as some reggae.
What's your favorite style of
music?

A: I don’t have a favorite.
They’re all my favorites. I’m into
R&B, jazz, gospel, salsa, reggae,
you name it, I’m into it. I can’t
pick one. I

Q: When you do your songs,
what '5 the main point that you try
to get across? When you sit down
to write a rhyme or come up with
the music, what do you say ’'I‘
wanna do” with this song?

A: I don’t always try to put
across a message. The only thing
I do is stay positive. Stay positive,
and stay strong. That’s about the
only message I constantly will
stick to throughout everything.
I’m not a Public Enemy. I can't go
preachin’ because I’m not that
knowledgeable. I’m
knowledgeable, but I’m still
learnin’. So I have to learn as
much as I can before I can go
teach other people. I can only
speak on what I know.

Q: Last yearthere was an inﬂux
in people getting a lot holder in
their records, groups like N. WA.
and the 2 Live Crew, and I just
wanted to talk to you about them
for just a second. When you see.»
artists like N. WA. and the 2 Live:
Crew doing songs that are.»
degrading to women, how do you;
feel about that?

A: I ‘don’t feel that they’re.
degrading to women. I feel that:
they’re degrading to females that:

degrade themselves in the first
place. When you show you have
no respect for yourself, then why
should anyone else respect you?
[These groups] are exploiting
basically ——~ now, it’s wrong to
exploit, period — but they’re
exploiting basically women who
carry themselves in a cheap,
sleazy manner, who are
materialistically minded, [and

have] no respect for themselves,
in other words.

So, therefore, they lN.W.A., et
all no respect for them. They
don’t mean people like me,
people like [MC] Lyte. We don’t
carry ourselves in that way. We’re

positive sisters. They would never
walk up to me and be like ‘Latifah,
that bitch,’ you know what I’m
saying? They’ve got respect for
me. Ice—T, all of them, speak to
me with enough respect. lt’s just
that there’s a problem with our
women out here today, our
females, and they need to really
grow stronger, and they need to
be more positive and let go of all
that. ‘I wanna man with a gold
chain and a Benz and money
...’ Get the money on your own.
Earn it yourself, and stop
depending on people who have
it already. Using them to get it

Q: At the radio station, we get a

want to get into the rap industry.
I’m sure they want to know what
they can do to make it in the

suggestions?

A: First of all, education is a
must. Education is a must, and
you must stay away from drugs.
Because if you have no education,
somebody is gonna offer you
drugs. You take ‘em, you’re done.
You get a record deal. You sign
your life away. you’re done.

You have to get your education
first, or everyone else is going to
take advantage of you if you do
get a record deal. But if you
don’t, you have to have some
type of foundation there just in

case. If you really want to be a
musician, an artist, a rap artist, go
for it. But you have to get your
education first, because you might
make it.

If every kid in America who
wanted to be a rapper was a
rapper, it would just be too much.
Everyone’s not gonna make it, so
those who can’t have to have
something to fall back on. So I
think education is the first thing,
and then you can go for it, try the
best you can  talent shows and
things like that.

awed silence. She was tall, dressed

the celebrity and the public was
never overstepped through the
entire hour. Unlike the quiet,
humble appearance of Anthony
Hopkins, that of Kathleen Turner
was truly that of the Hollywood
star —— an ambience reinforced by
a tired, but noticeably enthusiastic
desire to theatrically perform for
the audience as if she were still
on stage or screen.

Her every response was driven
by a simple necessity to politely
answer the question with little
extraneous elaboration. She was
at first reminiscent of a
captivatingly mature young
woman, punctuating her speech
with quickly widening eyes and
playfully shifting her leggy frame
about in her chair in between
rapid—ﬁre witticisms and hardened
ﬂippancy. Miss Turner’s father
was a diplomat; she acquired her
relaxed speech and a distinctive
accent from her stay in South
America as a child.

Topics ranged from her latest
film role in War of the Roses to

her work here in Pittsburgh
theater as Maggie in Cat on a
Hot Tin Roof Miss Turner also
talked about her work on the
soap opera “The Doctors” and
“Saturday Night Live.”

Of her work with two of her
favorite co-stars, Danny DeVito
and Michael Douglas, Turner
said, “Michael’s a lot of fun. He
takes me to biker bars. 
Danny pissed me off, but we
were very careful not to
undermine his position [as a
director]. I think he’s a good
director. I’m very impressed
with his work on this film.”

Someone asked of Turner’s
opinion of her character in the
film, describing her as being,
“angry. She pushed it so far.”
Miss Turner quickly said, “I
thought she was being
reasonable.” In a ﬁlm director,
Turner prefers three things:
“intelligence, a sense of humor,
conﬁdence.”

Sue Got Married, he was known to
(and still is) direct from his trailer,
filled with video equipment
monitoring every shooting unit. He
asked her, “Do you mind if I go to
my trailer to direct?” She responded,
“Why, no. I’ll go to mine."

Miss Turner compared the actors
of America to England, stating, “The
English don't emphasize vocal work,
but the Americans are much better
physically. Acting is a true profession
in England. Most of them here are
probably gay or something. Some of
them they must have found in a
drugstore.” She feels that “there is
no overnight success. At least none
that lasts."

Her personal and public life don’t
seem to be forcibly separated; with
Turner it seems to be a matter of
preference. “I have very few friends
who are actors," she said, “as my
social world is quite outside the
business.” She ﬂatly states to the
paparazzi, “OK, guys, you got 20
seconds.” She quickly adds, “It works
for me; you know I don’t punch
anybody.” .

The absence of a strong desire to
work as anything but an actress
stresses her focus on her career and
family. But she adds, “If there were
50 hours a day, I would make the

world happy, honey.”

The employees of Charles J. Greve and Company
responded to the article in The Pitt News on February 13, 1990:

The Pitt News tried to arrange meetings between the tenants and Mr. David Greve, but although Mr. Greve was
available and committed to meet with the tenants on those occasions, a time suitable for the tenants could not be
arranged. Charles J. Greve and Company Real Estate is always willing to meet with tenants if problems arise.

 

#1. The tenants Mast and Brant were renewal tenants. If it was so horrible an apartment, why did the tenants renew

their lease with Charles J. Greve and Company? (it should be noted that a favorable letter from one of these tenants ..

is on file at Greve’s office.)

#2. Citing a specific incident where upon the bannister which was maliciously destroyed, was brought to the Greve
office, David Greve promised replacement of post and repair of staircase and Greve came through within 24 hours
with total repair including repainting. Allegheny County Health Department confirms this.

#3. All Housing Department violations were abated within 24 hours of notification to Charles J. Greve and
Company.

#4. All common areas of Greve property including area in the photograph on the front page of The Pitt News are
cleaned weekly. We invite you to follow up and check. .

#5. Mr. Yingling has sublet his apartment and no longer resides in Pittsburgh and the current subtenant has no
complaints regarding the apartment and has asked to renew for next year. _

#6. Charles J. Greve and Company employs CathedralAnswering Service to handle 24-hour-a-day calls, seven days
a week including holidays.

- Charles J. Greve and Company is committed to quality housing and management.
- We invite you to inspect any or all apartments that we manage/own.

- We are always willing to negotiate and write into our leases speciﬁc alterations to accomodate I

tenants. This has been and always will be our policy.
