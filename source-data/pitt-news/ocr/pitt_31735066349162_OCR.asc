Students’ Union Organizing

BY BILL MOORE

A proposed union for students

- employed within the University has

begun to draw support in the wake
of a ﬁring dispute this week
involving a Burger Chef employe.
Barbara Ranck, employed at
Burger Chef for about two months,
was fired earlier this week
allegedly because she attempted to
organize a grievance committee
i_ong the restaurant employes.

'1 . Ranck told the Pitt News she was

informed by her supervisor, Hugh

Franklin, that she was losing her
approximately 19-hour-per-week
job because of her attempts to
organize a grievance committee.

Burger Chef franchise owner_
Peter Maggio denied allegations
that he instructed Franklin to ﬁre
Ranck for her organizing activities.

“I’m trying to avert trouble, not
start it," Maggio said.

Maggio termed the matter a
misunderstanding and said he
offered Ranck her job back but she
decided not to take it. Maggio said
he supports the idea of a student

Platt Calls for Control
Of Student Fee Interest  

' BY TOM WENSTON
An estimated $5,000 in yearly

fee should be controlled by the

Student Government Board (SGB), '

President Larry Platt
Wednesday's meeting.

’ "The buying power of the money

we collected from the fee this year
is decreasing,'‘' Platt said. “We
donft want to have to raise it while
interest it's earning is kept by the
University."

Interest earned by tuition and
other fees is used to subsidize
various University programs, Platt
said, but interest from the activities
fee should be turned over to
students. '

“The activities fee is different

said at

fjgtom all other revenues generated

' the University," he said. ‘‘It is
both levied and managed by
students.

“Secondly, the sole purpose of
the fee is for entertainment and
extracurricular activities. Unlike
any other program on campus, the
activities fee is independent of the
University in terms of purpose and
management."

Platt said Pitt administrators
objected to his proposal. “The
Chancellor said I was raising legal
questions. and not- considering the
overhead charges in collecting the
fee," he said.

“He did agree, though, to
conduct a legal analysis to see if the
activities fee can be differentiated
from other_fees."

‘In other action, SGB member
Mark Satinoff reported on Tues-
day's meeting of University stu-
dent employes interested in union-
ization. ‘.

“About 25 students attended
and they were from several job
sites on campus, such as the

Student Union, Burger Chef and

the audio-visual department,"
Satinoff said. “They will be
involved’ in basic research on
student grievances and they plan to
look at the options open to them,
such" as contacting outside un-
ions." .
The next meeting of student
employes involved in the issue will
be Tuesday in the SU lower lounge
at 7 pm,‘ Satinoff said.

The entire fact-finding process

Work on Pitt’s new Law School
has been _completed and the

building will be ready for classes

January 5, according to Physical
‘Plant Project Manager George
Simmons said all construction on
the six-story structure has been
ﬁnished except for the causewa
over Forbes Avenue that will link
the Law School with the Towers
“The power company has to

move high-voltage transformers-

from the Towers construction area
before we can put the causeway
in,” Simmons said.
December it should be ﬁnished.”
Simmons said there were no

construction for two years.

list at a recent meeting, according
to Lesgold. ‘

The study of advising. and
counseling will focus on ﬁve areas:
-academic, financial counseling,
career and ‘life planning, personal
counseling, and placement.

The academic area will range
from counseling on course selection
to requirements. The study of
ﬁnancial counseling will focus on
various aspects of availability of aid
and how to apply for aid.--—

MAN ‘PROTECTS’ FORD

SAN FRANCISCO AP—A man
carrying a toy gun who claimed he
was trying to protect President
Ford was taken into custody
Thursday at a parking garage near
the downtown hotel where Ford
spoke to a political luncheon.

The man—he said his name was
“Albert W. Zero”—was released
to San Francisco police after two
hours, and the Secret Service said

‘there was no indication he actually

intended to harm the President.
The incident occurred about 10

5,-sgnrinutes before Ford departed the
A‘ ‘St. Francis Hotel, where five weeks

earlier he had been the target of an
apparent assassination attempt.

Singing “Glory, Glory Halle-
iulah" and rambling on about his
affection for.whisky, the man was
taken from the Union Square
Garage for questioning by Secret
Service agents.

CROFTON, Md. AP——Saying
that “some day the whole story can
be told," former Vice’ President
Spiro T. Agnew categorically
denied again Thursday that he was
ever guilty of anything except a
single count of income tax evasion
to which he pleaded “no contest.”

He also said he knows nothing
about what went on at his
plea-bargaining sessions with fed-
eral prosecutors, and said “you
have no idea” how heavy the
pressure was put on him to resign.

Agnew noted his “increasing

Fact-Finding

(Continued from Page 1)

The deadlock came as Campus
Police were negotiating a reopener
on a three-year. contract. Police
union demands include a $.65-an-
hour raise, a ban on subcontracting
campus security work to outside
agencies and limitations to the
number of hours worked by
part-time City Police on the campus
force.

A reopener is a clause in_a~

contract enabling a union to update
the terms of speciﬁc agreements in
long-range commitments.
Although police union officials
have accused the University of
being reluctant to approach media-
tion channels to resolve the

deadlock, Pitt representatives have’

contended that the fact-finding
step is legal and therefore that
objections are immaterial.

The dispute over subcontracting
involves the use of agencies outside
the University to do security work
on campus, and according to police
union officials arose from fears of
campus force jobs being phased out
in preference of security-type
guards.

The University denied these
charges, stating the use of security
personnel was aimed at providing
ﬂexibility and maximizing the use
of force talents on the streets as
opposed to “locked-building” jobs.

Behind Every Pinball

One of the hottest non-issues on campus this term has been the
moving of the Towers pinball machines from the main lobby into the

respective building lobbies.

The administration and the Resident Students Association [RSA]
lnvebeenpartiestoacomedyoferrorsinwhichneither side could
hearethe other over its own arguing.

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Alfred Moye’s suggestion to move
the machines into each Tower because of their attraction to outsiders
seemed reasonable enough. In no way would the move have adversely

. -affected student playing, and one positive effect would’ve been the loss
of the penny arcade atmosphere in the main Towers lobby.

Although the Oﬂice of Student Affairs didn’t base its case on these
two points, the point it did try to make went totally undocumented.
Claiming too many transients used the machines and posed a threat to
security, the office let its opinion rest with the RSA without substantial

evidence to back it up.

damage. Of course, any concrete evidence to the contrary might well

Letter

Q Concerning the article “Leaming
That You’re Gay” (October 15), I
, totally agree homosexuality is not a
-a moral or political issue and, in

 particular, homosexuality is ‘not in

therefore,
Given this,

immoral and,
should not be illegal.

however, I want to argue that,

 certain universally shared psycho-
»  :logic'al:needs cannot be fulﬁlled by

homosexual actions, but only by
heterosexual actions.
Now it might well be true that

« people would not necessarily “fall
-.f in love”

with members of the

" opposite sex if they had never been

_. told be others that this is what
‘always "happens to everyone.

 Nevertheless, there seem to be

the widely-held pernicious notion
that homosexual actions are
“harmfully unnatural." Rather,
the homosexual is choosing to deny

tively better than in homosexual
actions (or in masturbation or

(3) The upshot of (2) is that
everyone, whether they are able
and/or willing to admit it or not,
has certain psychological needs to
experience these feelings that an
individual experiences homosexual
actions as being as good as or even
ones,
there must be, it seems, psycho-
logical factors that are reducing his
(her) enjoyment of’ heterosexual
actions.‘ A

What I want to suggest from all
of this is that the presumably
“happy" homosexuals seriously
consider the experiences of the

. great majority of self-admittedly '

“unhappy” homosexuals who do
turn to psychological counseling.
Namely, it is usually the case that

_once certain psychological factors
* particularized to an individual

homosexual are “experienced’_’ by
him (her) in a suitably cathartic
manner and thereby eliminated, he
then able to enjoy
heterosexual actions . more than
homosexual ones. If my position is
correct, “happy” homosexuals
then have something to gain, but
nothing to lose.

Tuesday's election

Dems and GOP on the Runﬂ

Editor’s Note: In light of next
week’s county elections, the Pitt
News is running columns by
representatives of the contending
parties. Here are the endorsements
and the platforms of the Democrat-
ic and Republican parties.

BY BET NELSON

“This time, all of the good
candidates are Democrats” should
be the slogan used" by all
Democratic candidates in the ’75
General Election. To use the
current slogan “Once again, most
everyone worth voting for is
Democratic,” implies there are
Democratic candidates who are not
of the quality that the Democratic
party has tried to maintain through
the last 25 years.

Bob Colville is the Democratic
nominee for district attorney. As

_ the former police superintendent of

Pittsburgh, Colville has 15 years of
law enforcement experience. He
understands that the law enforce-
ment system needs re-evaluation.
Indeed, the whole system needs
revitalization. With Bob Colville’s
experience in the administration of
justice, he is the person most likely
to start reform in Allegheny
County. ‘
There is only one statewide
judicial race. Judge Edmund
Spaeth is seeking to continue as a
judge of the Superior Court, where
he was first appointed in January
1973. He was the ﬁrst judge to be
selected by the Appellate Court
Nominating Commission created

by the Governor to provide for ‘

merit selection of appellate judges.
Spaeth’s record makes him one of
the leading jurists in the Common-
wealth. In fact, some attorneys
regard Spaeth as the finest judge to‘
emerge from the ranks of legal
scholars in Pennsylvania.

Out of nine seats open for.
Common Pleas- Court, ‘six judges
have won nominations on both
ballots. They are Bernard McGow-
an, George Ross, ‘Francis Barry,
Livingstone Johnson, Nicholas

Papadakos and James R. McGre- »

gor. They have virtually won the’
election.

Two sitting judges won only the a

Democratic nomination. They are-
Judge Nathan Schwartz and Judge.
Robert Dauer. Richard Zeleznik
also won a Democratic nod in
Apri_l’s primary.

Judge Schwartz said the appro- '
priate sentence is absolutely .

critical to the society and to the
defendant.
Judge Dauer was a trial attorney

with 15 years experience before_

becoming a judge of the Common
Pleas Court, Criminal Division. He
has been on the bench for three
years. He was .a former‘ City of
Pittsburgh magistrate, presiding
over more than 20,000 preliminary
hearings. In the past, Dauer held
positions of legal clerk for the
Pennsylvania Superior Court and
assistant city solicitor for the City.
Richard Zeleznik -has been arr
outstanding trial attorney for the

last 22 years. He is past president ‘

of the Pennsylvania Boro Solicitor’s
Association. He is the current
solicitor of West Mifflin and
Dravosburg Boroughs.

_ John Lynch, a City councilman,
is running for the office of county’
controller. John is the finance
chairman of city council and is a

M registered stockbroker.

Incumbent county Treasurer

\ Edward Cooke has led the fight to

change investment laws for Alle-
gheny County. He -computerized
the entire operation. As a result,
the office operates at maximum
efficiency and not one additional
employe has been added to the

office since Cooke took over in

1968.

John “Pete” Joyce is the
incumbent prothonotary. All costs
and expenses are paid from fees
collected. He has instituted a
modern, efficient filing method and

in a decrease in cases backlogged
in the Orphan’s Court.

Wayne Kelly has the nomination
for the office of clerk of courts. He
has been the executive assistant to
Allegheny County Commissioner
Tom Foerster.

John Exler has returned, as
recorder of deeds, % of a million
dollars to taxpayers, money he
could have legally kept.

For city ofﬁces, John McGrady is
running unopposed for the position
of controller.

Five people are Democratic

nominees for city council. They are A

Dick’ Caliguiri, Eugene DePas-

quale, Louis Mason, James Lally .

and Richard Givens. Caliguiri,

DePasquale and Mason are run- .

ning for re-election. Lally and

Givens are newcomers.

In the 43rd senatorial district
there is a special election for the
remainder of former Senator
Mazzei’s unexpired term. Jim
Romanelli, the current legislator
for the 22nd legislative seat, is
running for the remainder of
Mazzei’s term. Romanelli has
worked full-time as a state
representative, sponsoring legisla-
tion to put state government to
work for the people-of. Pennsylvan-
ia. He plans to continue this
emphasis in government.

It-is now all up to you.

Allegheny. A I ‘County has_- ‘i been V

overwhelmingly Democraticfor the
past four decades. Tuesday,
however, there may be some
surprises. Allegheny County
Republicans are alive and well, and
this could be the Year ofthe Big
Change. '

This “change” ironically could
begin with the re-election of Dr.
William R. Hunt as county
commissioner. Hunt has been on
the Board of Commissioners since
1967. and he led all of his
opponents in the last election.
Robert N. Peirce, Hunt’s running
mate, is currently the clerk of
courts and has been since 1971.

The Big Change platform con-

sists of ﬁve major points:

l).‘ A transit plan for all of
Allegheny County and a voter
referendum for the people to
decide; 

2) A reform of the County’s
assessment policies;

3) A full eight-hour work day for
ALL county employes;

4) A freeze on the County budget
for 1976; and

5) A reduction of the costs of
County government. ‘

For district attorney, the Repub-
licans are offering Bernard Marko-

» Lawson. a

extremely diversified.
'Abra'movitz'-‘of Squirrel Hill is a

only for the office and not with theidrf

own private practices on the side.
Markovitz has had experience in

' front of the Superior and Supreme

Courts of Pennsylvania, as well as
the County Court of Common
Pleas, which well qualifies him to
seek this position.

The Big Change continues with

- clerk of courts candidate Shelly

Friedman. She is an attorney from
Squirrel Hill and is employed’ as a
solicitor in the clerk of courts office.
Friedman has first-hand know-
ledge of the office, and as a lawyer,
is able to understand the complex‘
procedures that the clerk of cotfT\'
faces each day. . J

George F. Pott, Jr. is the
Republican candidate for county
treasurer. Pott is well qualified for
the office, as he is an accountant
and experienced in the field of
finance. He will be able to invest
the County’s taxes to obtain the
maximum interest, and intends on
making the treasurer’sv office a
full-time operation by working his
entire day there.

The county controller is a- person
who channels the tax dollars back
into the programs of the County.
Former Congressman William S.
Conover promises to be a Watch-
dog over spending to insure that

tax dollars will be spent to benq”"~‘;~._.

the people of Allegheny County‘. "

For the remainder of the Row"
offices, the Republicans have three
young and experienced men
attempting to unseat the incum-
bents. They are: Roger Waun, a
speech professor at Penn State at
McKeesport, for recorder of deeds;
Jay’ R. Wells, a former legislator
from Bethel Park, for prothonotary;
Robert Casey, a small businessman
with offices , in Pittsburgh and
Washington, is running for register
of wills. >

There are nine vacancies for
judges to the Court of Common
Pleas; however, six men hag-he:
received both Democratic " ‘
Republican nominations, leaving
three seats up for grabs. Alan
Frank of Mt. Lebanon, Erik F.
resident of Moon
Township and former solicitor in
McKeesport, and Emil E. Narick, a
Democratic representative of labor,
who won the Republican nomina-
tion in May, will be vying for the
three" seats on'the.bench. All of
these men are _well-_respected
attorneys with experience -in front
of the Court of Common Pleas-

. There is only one statewide race
in this election. It isfor one seat‘ on
the bench of _the'Superior Court of
Pennsylvania. _
candidate is Judge Silvestri Silv -:7’

' tri of Pittsburgh, whois currently

on the Court of Common Pleas in

‘Allegheny County. _ In his tenure on

the County,‘ bench, Silvestri has
gained the exp'eri'ence ‘necessary
for a judge in’-the Superior Court.

As for Pittsburgh,City_~Council, '

candidates are
Leon

the ‘Republican

teacher"; John R.‘ Clark of East
Liberty is a student at ,Duquesne
University; Norm Marous is, a
management consultant; and Les-
ter C. Jordan is a pharmacist. All
of them are lifelong Pittsburghers
and they are all interested and
concerned with the welfare of the
City and its people. ’

ln the special election for‘ Sta:§\

have ‘L3

Senate. the Republicans
offered Francis C. Fratangclo, a
scout for the Baltimore Orioles
from Hazelwood. Fratangelo is
interested in bringing respectabil-
ity back ‘to the office vacated by
Frank Maz‘/.ci. This senatorial
district contains Oakland and the
University campus. so*this is 'an
extremely important election for
the students and citizens of the
area. »

This Republican slate has youth
and vitality. but more important. it
hats experience and qualifications
for each respective office. With all
these things being set forth, the

I havejust read what seems to
be the hundredth letter about the
Pitt Marching Band, and primarily
the Golden Girls. At ﬁrst I thought
Iwouldn’t say anything in response
to all these ignorant people, but I
think it's about time one of us
spoke up.

We have been Pitt Majorettes
since April 6, 1975, after coming
through a particularly trying
two-day tryout. At the end of that
tryout, nine girls were chosen out

about it. The famous anony_m_ous
Pantherette did have the heart to
concede that “she was the best one
there." That was Cervi’s primary
concern. He knew that he would be
igniting a lot of criticism by picking
. Jackie, but he wanted what would
look best in the ﬁeld. If he would
have picked someone who wasn’t
as good, the same people would be
‘screaming for another reason.
Should Jackie have been penalized
for knowing Cervi before this?
Larry Cervi is a well-known
choreographer throughout the
Pittsburgh area and has worked
with many majorette squads and
dance teams. It would be very hard
to ﬁnd a twirler in Pittsburgh who
has not been in contact with him in
one way or another.
Everyone remembers the big

that-I noticed in the ﬁrst hours of
tryouts. at least 20 girls just walked
out. many ‘of them former
Pantherettes who were so conﬁdent
before the tryouts began. The same
thing happened at the tryout later
this year. Twenty girls were there
at the beginning, yet when the ﬁnal
audition began, there were only
ﬁve left. We went through a
grueling week of band camp, which
is not to be believed unless you go
through it yourself. Now we are
practicing from 10 to 12 hours a
week, having another audition each
week to pick the alternate, and the
only comments in the Pitt News are
critical ones from people who
probably couldn’t even get out on
that ﬁeld. ,'

As for the “Jacqueline Scott"
crisis,” I am just sick of hearing

if   I I     1   s--Pa

turmoil over Howe'r’s position as
band director last year. Part of the
reason he was criticized‘ was that
we wanted the majorettes.,Yet he

stuck with his decision and this‘

year put a brand new section of
nine girls who have never worked
together as a team on the ﬁeld.
We're working as hard, if not
harder, than the rest of the band,
yet it seems as though all we get
from our fellow students is
criticism.

How about opening all of your
closed little minds and giving us a
chance?

Loss of Heart

And Sentiment

I am appalled by the action
against “Tiger Paul” (Auslander).
Tiger Paul for three years has been
a faithful Pitt fan. He turned the
usual apathetic crowds into'roar-
ing, cheering spectators.

Perhaps Auslander’s image is
not the typical, blonde-haired,

    

Is this the thanks he deserves?
Tiger Paul is a rare treasure and
should be treated as such.

Pitt should have felt fortunate 1 i I A

and proud of their Tiger Paul. To
me, Pitt has lost a devoted, loving
fan, and the basketball games will

never be the same. We all should ' '1: 
bow our heads in shame for his _

atrocity.

Standing and sweating in the

chairs are close to each other,
uncomfortably close. Aha—I had

_ asked. .

 

tle, I plunged into the situation.
How would people react to my
sitting next to them, or in front of
them, and watching them eat? In
the crowded eatery, who would
ever suspect what I was doing
anyway?

‘THE HIDE-BEHIND-THE-PAPER.
GAME

Looking around as if I couldn't
ﬁnd an empty seat, my eyes
naturally came to rest upon an
attractive blond and the empty seat

. opposite her.

“Do you mind if I sit here,” I
“No, go ahead,” she
replied softly. Having nothing but
a Coke (my excuse for needing a
chair), I sipped it, observed the guy
across the way sucking a dangling
onion into his mouth, and then
stared at the girl in front of me.
After a minute of my intense

staring (she .didn’t look directly at

me once), she whipped out the Pitt
News, building a paper wall
between us. I coughed hard

enough to make Vwir_1_d rustle the __

 

paper. But no reaction.

Then, every 15 seconds, her
hand reached around the news-
paper and slid a French fry from
the bunch on a napkin. I couldn't
resist.

Grabbing the comer of the
napkin, I inched the pile of fries to
the center of the orange tray‘.
Fifteen seconds were up. Out.came
her hand, only this time it landed
on the empty tray. She folded the
paper down, looked at the fries,
and gave me a scornful look. I
smiled, got up, and put the paper
back in front of her face.

THE DELERIOUS MAN

Farther in the back of the Burger
Chef sat a man, I'd say 25 years
old, with black slicked-back hair, a
pointed nose and black eyes. A
briefcase sat open on the table and,
with his shoulders hunched down,.~
he was peering inside it. As I
approached him, I could hear him
muttering, incoherently and" angri-
ly, in what I took to be a foreign
language. I; ‘plopped down_

catty-corner to him, going into a
hard stare.

Believe it or not, this guy was
acting weirder than I. First, he ran
off what had to be a string of
obscenities (I could tell by the
syllables—crodder-bucker), then
smiled for a second and took to
maundering again, never ﬂinching
under my now-laughing stare.

“Is there anything wrong, sir?” I
asked. He sat there as if I never
had said a word. I felt the same as
when I say “Hi” to someone‘ and
he either doesn’t see me, or looks
at me and doesn’t say anything.
Try again, I thought.

“Hey, is everything all right?”aI/4

he looked back into the briefcase,

She
had an array of books, including
introductions to psychology, socio-
logy and composition.

As soon as I sat down, she looked
at her watch. It was only 12:30

though, too early to sit waiting in %
classroom, so out came a notebook. 

“10-3-7S” was written at the top of
the page she studied. Now why, I
wondered, would she review that
page, for about ten minutes, on
10-24-75? ‘

I suspected it was the old “read
your notebook to act unaware of the
person in front of you” game.
Well, my foot “accidently” ended
up touching her’s under the table
as I stretched my legs. As if
electrically shocked, her foot pulled
away. I did it again. She pulled
away again. * .

Within the next minute, she
looked at her watch three times,
the third time, I think, becoming
conscious of what she had done
(time doesn't change that much
after only 10 seconds), for her neck
and cheeks turned pink. Now I had
to get up and leave out of
embarrassment, because her em-
barrassment was making me emba-
rassed (Undercover situations get
rather sticky sometimes).

AN UNMANNERED DOG ACT

i Getting a “Super Chef” and
another Coke, I noticed the crowd
was thinning out. Sitting directly
across from someone in those little
two-seaters now was. probably
going to look like an attempted
“rap,” especially since plenty of
seats were tree.

, 4':

I was searching for someone
older (and hopefully more conser-
vative) to be witness to my
unmannerly plot. In a corner sat a
female (age 30?) who, from
external signs (hair in a bun,
plastic rather than wire-rim glas-
ses, knee-length dress), appeared
to be a member the University
bureaucracy.

After meandering up to her spot
and ridiculously acting like I was
searching for a seat when there
were plenty around, I sat down.
Already buried in the paper, she
only glanced up at my arrival, and
then ducked back behind the
paper, eating a hamburger or the
newspaper.

I munched on my Super Chef for
a few minutes. Then I burped out
loud. No reaction. Reaching the
bottom of my Coke, I sucked on the
straw, making that near-empty

glass gurgling noise for about 10
seconds. Still, no reaction
(outward, at least).

Then, as if taken by a ﬁt of
burping, I let out a small burp, then
a long throaty one. “Oh, my
God,” the woman disgustedly
exclaimed, “what’s the matter with
you?"

“My indigestion,” I mumbled,
as I began choking madly, “got it
(gag, gag, gag,) real bad, I’m sorry
excuse me, please.” And I hurried
from the table.

Feeling like a true ass, I decided
to go back and explain the whole
affair to her.- “Oh lady,” I said,
“look, I’d like to explain what just
happened. You see, I'm a psych
major and I was just doing research
for a term paper. I’m trying to ﬁnd
out people’s reactions to unman-
nerly and rude behavior.”

“That’s weird,” she said.

Circus a Three-Ringed Treat

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

They call it greatest show on
earth.‘ Ringling Brothers Barnum
and Bailey.Circus held its opening
show last night in Pittsburgh, and
the dazzle and thrill was back.

Certainly there’s something
about a circus that gets through
even to the most jaded glitter-
tripper. Something is always
happenirig, from lions roaring to
spangled bodies flipping and
clowning around with the audience.

No show ever comes back to a
‘ city with the same performance,
and this kind of versatility lends

freshness to the performance.
The star performer, of course, is

.Gunther Gebel Williams, whose

work with animals has won him
international fame and quite a few
spots on the Johnny Carson Show.

Williams is a madman of speed
and performance. His is the only

. act in the world using horses, tigers

and elephants simultaneously in
the center ring. ‘

The big-cat acts are interesting,
incredible exhibitions of training
and patience. Williams’ show
makes you lean back and shake
your head in wonder.

The best shock value of the

L eyes,
' nervously shifting their positions

evening are the high-wire acts,
including Philippe Petit, the same
man who recently crossed a
highwire strung between the Trade
Center Towers in New York City.
While contemplating a crossing of
Niagra Falls, Petit spends his time
wringing anxious groans from the
audience as he leaps and plays on
the wire.

The nearest thing to insanity is
the Carillo Brothers’ Act from
Columbia, South America. Not
content to merely walk the wire,
they bounce over one another in an
aerial leap-frog match that leaves
the people ‘up front covering their
and the circus workers

underneath.

While Petit and the Carillo
Brothers forsake the comforts of
the wire, trapeze artists need them
the most. I counted at least four
spills, each one bringing people to
their feet.

This sense of the amazing dates
back to P.T. Barnum himself, a
firm believer in gold spangles and
velvet. The opulence of this years’
show is incredible, and circus front
men claim millions of dollars have
gone into the wardrobe. I

So if sheer dazzle is a
prerequisite, then there is no
matching the impact of the Barnum
and Baily show. Certainly Alice
Cooper and the carnival tribes of
rock and rollers could learn a few
lessons from this display of visual
imagery.

There seems to be a revitaliza-
tion of whatever it is that draws
people to the circus: be it nostalgia,
curiousity or good-time seekers.

The circus transcends dance,
music and concert frenzy in its
complexity, and thus becomes
theatre in the oldest meaning of the
word. _

Perhaps there are deep motives
behind the actions of the perform-
ers. If so, they weren’t apparent.
But then neither were the motives
of the medieval players and
commedia del’arte.

If circuses are really the roots of
theatrical performance, they’re
probably at the roots of a lot of
other things in American culture.
Barnum and Bailey in particular
has found its way into almost every
aspect of American life; in

Springsteen's Legend

(Continued from Page 8)
reading) one thing is presented
clearly and unmistakably without
pretension—Bruce Springsteen
feels caught up in a madness that
isn’t of his own design.

His career has been choppy and
ﬂatering up to the latest album
Born to Run. This is the one the
hype began at Columbia and the
single “Born to Run” hit the
charts...high. Epitomizing the en-
ergy and macho lyrics of Spring-
steen in this single, the hungry
rock hangers-on grasped for Bruce
and his tantalizing power.

Sadly, reviews praised this

album while forgetting or losing

sight of his last two, which were far
superior to this one...especial1y in
engineering and production, which
doesn’t say much for Landau’s
help. _

So it all came down from the top.
We all know about Bruce “Hot
Foot” Springsteen and his per-
formances and hot-rod-baby-I-
love-ya’ lyrics, but what does he
have in store for us later on? Or for
that matter, what do Landau and
Appel have planned for us?

I would hope two things: that
Bruce, as reported,:keeps the pay
scale with his band as a flat rate for
all the members; and that he
doesn’t take his act to the larger
halls. He has refused to perform in
them already, but the demand‘
might get high and economics
might‘ jump out in front of him. I
can’t imagine hearing “Spanish

in my opinion, some of the current
styles of dress.

The dance on the highwire, the
ﬂying trapeze, all of these in some
sense appeal to our own desire for
the dangerous and glorious life, the
irresistible urge for the ultimate
fame. ‘

After the house lights come up '

that last time, it may be all over,
but for those two hours the dream
is real, and that's enough.

There are exactly seven hours of
that drama left in Pittsburgh until
the circus leaves on Sunday.

Syracuse: Must Game  

(Continued from Page 10)
season for Pitt. If injuries have not
taken too large a toll (15 players

didn't practice until Wednesday or '

later) and if the team can put the
Navy game out of their minds, then
a strong comeback is highly
probable.

On the other hand, if they have
spent this week brooding over the
Navy loss and are not prepared
mentally for Syracuse, it could be a
long afternoon of football. West
Virginia went through this type’ of
thing the week after Penn State
demolished them, 39-0; they lost to
Tulane in a big upset, 16-14.

In the last three games Syracuse

N has played Navy and Penn State

very close, and beat Boston College
last week, I7-3. Pitt won last,
year's game 21-13, the first
Panther win since 1920 at Archbold
Stadium, and you can bet your
“Prowl with Pitt" bumper sticker

the Cats will have their hands full _

tomorrow . ._

A win by any margin might put
the Panthers back in fairly decent
shape for the rest of the season.
The ﬁnal three games will be so

The Pitt-West Virginia football
game on November 8 will be shown
live via closed-circuit TV _at the
Stanley Theater, 207 Seventh
Street, downtown. Student tickets
will be $3.50 plus .35 city tax, and
will go on sale today in the Student
Union ticket office.

Preceding the football game will .

be a ﬁlm of the last Muhammed
Ali-'—Joe Frazier fight, “The
Thrilla in Manilla,” which will
begin at noon.

Tickets for the general public
also will be sold at the door for
$6.60.. The production will be
sponsored by Sports Spectacular
Productions in conjunction with
Cinemette Theaters. .

If the game is put on regional
TV, all money will be refunded.

emotional'that by then the Navy
game will be all but forgotten, and
the Panthers chances for a bowl
game would hinge on their winning
two of the last three games.

“We're not going to be taken
aback by people who give up the
ship the first time it starts to tilt,”
said Majors about the fans who
booed on Saturday. If nothing else,
a win would rescue some of those
deserters.

A loss against Syracuse would

assure that Pitt would play an

eleven and not a 12-game schedule
this year; the chance for a bowl bid

would vanish. _
And with it. a lot of dreams.

PRINCE LOSES THRONE

PITTSBURGH AP—Bob Prince
apparently has waved his last
babushka as_ the partisan, zany
broadcaster for the. Pittsburgh
Pirates. It was announced
Thursday he'd been tired.

‘‘I love baseball, but I suppose
some people thought I wasn’t doing
the job," said Prince, who rooted
and rambled behind the Pirate
microphone for 28 years.

  ‘ Harriers To PSU:
Face Biggest Test

BY RALPH SPARKLE

The Pitt cross-country team will

run up against its strongest
opponents to date tomorrow at the
Central Collegiate Championships
at State College, Pa. .
p The undefeated Panther Harr-
iers, 5-0, will be seeking national
recognition when they face fourth-
ranked Penn State on a fast
ﬁve-mile home course. Seventh-
ranked Michigan and 10th-ranked
Eastern Michigan also will be vying
for honors. Otherlbig names and
schools such as Illinois, Indiana,
Notre Dame, Air Force and Kent
State will be present.

Head_ Coach Mike Agostinella
said he feels that his young runners
have matured immensely and have
helped add to a well-balanced
team. .

“I think the training background
and our record have given the guys
confidence,” he ‘said. ‘.‘Other
colleges may have ‘big names,’ but

we’re at least comparable if not
better than many of them. Our win
last week over Kent and Edinboro
is proof.

“Twenty-five teams comprise
the Central Collegiates and the
quality of the athletes will be the
best the Panthers have faced yet,”
Agostinella said. “If everyone
gives 100%, we should finish in the
top five.”

Defending champ Paul Stemmer
of Penn State and runner-up Mike
Irmen of Kent State will have to
keep an open eye for the Panthers.
Nick Martin, Mel Boyd and Dave
McDonald have been consistently
the front runners of the meets and
this one should be no different.

However, the Panthers’ strength
lies with their fourth-through
eighth-ranked Tom Herrmann, Ron
Wirick, Bob Lee and Mark
Studnicki, who have not yet failed.
