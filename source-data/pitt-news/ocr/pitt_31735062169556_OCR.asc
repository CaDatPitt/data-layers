Frustration: The Key to National Election

by JOHN NIRENBERG
Staff Political-Writer

Tomorrow i_s election day and
upwards of 60 million voters will
go to the polls to match wits with
the Voter Profile Analysis. It is
also the day that George Gallup
finds out how far off he was.

The most important result of
tomorrow’s balloting won’t be the
person who is elected, because
our system can accommodate any-
one we choose; it will be the at-
titude, the mood which will sur-
face among Americans when the
results are known.

If the choice is given to the
House of Representatives then the
intervening months will find the
American people even more un-
sure. If. however. a minority Pres-
ident is declared immediately on
Wednesday the problem of dis-
content is still there. It isn’t a
matter of simple arithmetic. how-
ever. because history has shown
that Americans generally accept
their fate and help to make the
best of it. Losing candidates re-

ROTC Credit:
A Controyersy .
  Near Crisis? 

by DON MARBURY
Staff Feature Editor

Approximately 200 students crowded around the Fifth Ave. en‘-
trance to the Cathedral Thursday to await the decision of the Univer?
sity on the question of whether credits would be taken away from
ROTC. Dr. Charles Peake. Provost of the University, was to speak to ’
the crowd. who call themselves the Majority of Concerned Students. 3

Before Dr. Peake arrived many students in ROTC voiced. their
opinions as to what they would do if credit were;taken away from
ROTC. “Even if the credits are taken away,” said one sophomore
ROTC student. “I feel that ROTC has too much to offer not stay in__
it. One student said that if credits were taken away from,ROTC,‘_tha't
it would be impossible for him to stay in the program. “You have to
do too much studying and preparation, and the course is too time con-
suming to take and not get credit,” the student said. “So if credit.
were taken away, even though I’d want to, I couldn’t possibly“ stay in,
ROTC.” he concluded. Another student even went as far to:sa“y that if
credits are taken away, or ROTC is abolished, he would get five
friends together and try to ablolish the sociology department of the

University.

Dr.-Peake told the students that a final decision had not been:
reached and that only the faculty of Arts and Sciences had the au-
thority and jurisdiction to decide whether credit would or would not
be given for ROTC courses. “The University intends to act rationally
in determining the decision and in terms of University policies,”

Peake said.

David Ehrenworth, one of the spokesman for the Majority of Con-.'
cemed Students, explained their position. “We are not here to pro-_’
test the two students’ decisions in the Undergraduate Council on
ROTC question,” he said. “We are here because we feel thattheir:
decisions were not appropriate. ROTC was not researched properly. _'
No one sat in on a ROTC class to find out what actually went on in it.;:
The Undergraduate Council just didn’t research the question enough
before making their decision,” Ehrenworth reiterated. T -

. Jack LaPietra. another spokesman for the group, told the group:
that 2,332 students had signed a petition to keep ROTC accredited.
He also felt that the Undergraduate Council had made a decisioii
based on half information; “They were ill—informed, regardless of the".
factthat they didn’t do the proper research,” he said. LaPietra said
that the Majority of Concerned Students would accept any decision
that the faculty decides on. “If they know all the information,’.’_.L'a-"
Pietra went on. “we have faith that they will reach a fair decision.” _ 

 

 

system has been challenged by
thousands of activists without an
alternative. This year has found
the hecklers, not the supporters,
playing the most important role
in a political rally.

And tomorrow is election day.

The problems which have be-
come issues in this campaign are
extremely complex; the candi-
dates themselves don’t have all
the answers but we must choose
one of the three. Many of us can
do no more than vote but we must
register some opinion. This is our
duty.

Our vote doesn’t mean that the
problems will be solved by the
man we choose; it means that the
man we choose and the adminis-
tration he constructs will ap-
proach these problems with even-
tual solutions in mind. If we do

not vote‘ we ‘concedejthat the ones _

Steve Miller Sails Toward Top ‘Of
Rock Music World On New Wax L

by JOE ANDERSON
Staff Entertainment Editor
The rock market is in danger of

satration. Bubble gum music (or
the Buddah Buffooni has become

_ the dark horse of the Billboard

Charts. Frank Zappa is calling for
a return to the styles of the fifties.
Country and Western is bordering
on the Indian Ocean and Black-
.Soul is being ingested by th e
Amorphous Psychedlic Amoeba.
Where will it lead?

The crystal ball of rock is mur-
ky and obscure. Besides. who
cares where rock goes as long as
we all get there at the same time
and without too much hardship.
It’s all music. no more, no less.
It’s'more important to enjoy rock
than to sit around throwing out
definitions. Anp that’s where the
Steve Miller Band fits in. They
are rock and need no futher def-
inition. Over the crowded and
stormy sea of pop music comes
the Steve Miller Band playing
havoc with winds and blind man’s
bluff with the tides.

Sailor (ST 2984) is a superb al-
bum. Artistically tender. unob-
trusively soft. Never loud for the
sake of volume, yet not afraid to
lay it down where it really mat-
ters. It has a certain anesthetic
magic which is hard to escape.
When the Steve Miller Band hit,
they hit well. Sailor is competent-
ly executed and, like Children of
the Future, exhibits a strong sense
of solidarity. The Steve Miller
Band is a group and not just a

The first cut, “Song to Our An-
cestors,” is my favorite and has a
rather long fog horn dialogue
in the beginning which gives this
piece a mysterious syrupy texture.
The dialogue fades into the
group’s instrumetal which fea-
tures a unique hit-and-run organ
section topped by a throbbing rep-
etitious piano. If the song as a
whole is referential then it is am-
biguous but does work well in
dark, close quarters. A different
thing is “Dear Mary” which just
gears — the soft vocal, the tight-
knit structure of the piano, the
timely accents: of both the trum-
pets and the drums. The whole
song is dreamy, ethereal in a
melancholy sense. S .o_ In e t h i n g
like David Ackes does on his al-
bum.. -

Where the ,S,tevel.:i-:.IlVIillei' Band
really cuts the nerve is in such
hard blues—rock pieces as “Living
in the USA” (forget about the 45
versions: a poor recording, a tech-
nical farce) and “Overdrive.” It’s
on these songs that the band
shows a very strong black blues
influence. Catch the harp on “Liv-
ing in the USA.” The Whole sec-
ond side with the exception of
“Quicksilver Girl.” is a complete
contemporary b 1 u e s statement.
“Overdrive” particularly reminds
me of the early Stones and their
“blues interpretation" bag. But
it’s the originality of the group
that makes this song (and the al-

bum) so eleclNic. There are, of-

-course. a few low points. the

worst of which is the dull and

tasteless vocal on “Lucky Man.”

This blunder is quickly forgot-
ten with the advance of “Gangs-
ter of Love.” This is a" monologue
song which is mimetic of the
“talking" song (I’m.a gangster‘.
baby. A gangster of love. ). It is a
humorous presentation w i th a
light instrumental background." A
fine job of mixing is accomplish-
ed when “Gangster” dissolves into
the faster pace of “You’re So
Fine.” This helps keep the album
moving ahp the listenpr awake.

For a group to be a success in

' the current rock market does not

presuppose the. fact that they are
laying down some really great
material. Successgusually. depends
on how much promotion a group
gets. The Steve Miller Band has
been around for a long time and
is only recently getting the kudos A
they deserve. They have a fantas-
tic sound that can only grow and
improve if given a chance. With
the paths of rock going in so many
directions of late one can only
hope that a course is set for the
Steve Miller Band.

 Think and Vote

Ft‘ ‘- For four months the American people have been splat-
-tered by the endless promises and hoopla of the Presidential
'?campaign.' And tomorrow all of the verbiage and balloon
stomping will end. -

This Presidential campaign has been quite expensive.
Richard Nixon’s campaign committee has spent an estimated
$20 million, while Citizens for Humphrey has written off at
‘least $10 million in expenses. All of this money was spent

« in/the attempt of selling the political candidates to the

Am_e_rica‘n people.

   The result of this giant sell, will be theelection of the
" :'nex__t President of the United States. There have been many

fabricated moments of happiness, and many genuine mo-

y .ments of frustration and anger in this most expensive of cam-
..paign‘s. But tonight all of us must look beyond many of the

empty campaign promises; we must look beyond the smiling
faces, and the thundering rallies; we must look beyond the
worried wrinkles of our presidential candidates. What must
we do? We must look into the minds of the candidates. To-
day, the campaign is over, and tomorrow the votes will be tab-
ulated —the die will be cast. .

 ‘It is very easy for the electorate—a frustratedpopula—
_tion—to latch on the simple answers and solutions the candi-
dates always have to the problems of our time. It is so easy
for’ frustrated people to believe in qualities of either of
the candidates and say: “He’s so experienced and wonder-
ful; he’ll solve all the problems that we have.” /

‘ But tonight, let. us be realistic. Can any of the candi-

"'dates, work miracles in the ghetto? Can they"alter the white '
,_ man’s fear and hatred of the black man? Can they make the
.?.’._'police of this nation learn about the concept of justice? Can
“ they turn back the tide of the politics of assination?

   
  
   
   
  
   
    
  
  
   
 
 
 

Can
they make man hate rather than love the ravages of war?
‘Can they make man cooperate rather than compete for sel-
fish, ends. Can they make people see other people? Can they
make man learn to, love rather than to hate‘? Can they rid
this nation of its backbone of hypocracy?

. These are some of the problems facing this nation‘ to-

goes on. Rather than looking for the cliches like new lead-

3 ership or the man you cantrust, the voters should think of

the real issue of this campaign——the relationship, of man with
‘his fellow man. Isn’t this what America—or any nation—is

._j ‘all about. We are a nation of people. But we never hear the
" politicians say too much about war, love, and hate. They us

_ the words, but the words are hollow and silent‘ . ~ ‘
A '  Even so, the voters—and the members of this University

comrnunity—must decide tonight which candidate can best

1. approach solutions to this nation’( human problems. We must

also think which candidate will aggravate the problems that
Ecould cause our doom. Above all we must be realistic and ana-
lytical in our choice, for this election certainly isn’t funand
games. This election gives the voters a choice—-a choice of
vast significance. . , _

 And this’ year the choice will be decided by a very slim
ma‘rg'in of-votes. And slim margins mean that every vote
will count; every vote will carrywith. it a great amount of
influence on the final election outcome.

 With this in mind, The Pitt News urges all the eligible

_. members of the University community to think of the seri-
'ous questions confronting the nation, and then put their

thoughts into action by casting their vote.

’night—-problems that will become even more comples as time '

Opinion

In Search of The Ideal Truth
Mr.  Moss vrs. Mr. Rosenblum

by PEGGY ALLEN
Staff News Writer

In the Pitt News, No\. 1, Ed Moss submitted
his version of the ROTC incident. claiming they
“Now the student body will read What really hap-
pened at Forbes Field.” He also made remarks
about David Rosenblum. that I know, to be slander-
ous and totally false. Unlike Moss. I was there.

To begin with. the people who were at Forbes
Field were not Students for Peace. but, in fact
were an ad hoc group of students and faculty mem-
bers who were opposed'to the accredidation

Moss then quoted a I conversation be-
tween Tom McKenz1d and M Sgt. Benedict Bost-
wick. Strangely enough. this was "I  if I’
not the same conversation that is
referred to in a statement written
by Richard Rose. ROTC coordin-
ator, and signed by both Bostwick
and McKenzie. Mr. McKenzie
told me that he has never talked
with Moss about the incident. and
that he never made the statement
quoted in Ross’ article.

ALLEN
cle Moss was referring to when he said “David Ros-
enblum has stated that he did not observe the in-

I also must wonder what arti-

cident until Sgt. Bostwick left,” Mr. Rosenblum
has never said this. I can testify to the fact that
he did see the incident. During the confrontation,
Mr. Rosenblum touched me on the shoulder and
told me to watch was was happening. He also told
a Pitt News photographer to take pictures of the

incident as it was occurring.

Moss states that Mr. Rosenblum is a spokesman
for the Students for Peace. This is an outright lie.
Mr. Rosenblum has never been affilliated in any
way with this organization. In fact, he was not even
a member of‘ the ad hoc group protesting the ac-
credidativn. I was covering the story for the Pitt
News, and when I asked Mr. Rosenblum to help
me. he replied. “I don’t really care one. way or
the other about ROTC. but I’ll go along just to
help." ‘

When Mr. Rosenblum stated that the incident
was “a blatant act of assault.” he was not merely
giv_ing his opinion of the incident that he witness-
ed. but also theopinion of two professors of the
University’s Law School. He was not. as Moss

. claims. “taking the place of District Attorney, a

judge. and a jury.” Rather, he was giving his own
opinion based on the first hand experience. This is
his right as a columnist.

Moss claimed that “Dave Rosenblum’s article

is a distortion of the facts as they happened.” I -

claim that Moss’ article is a distortion of the facts.

  

Was he even at Forbes Field? Perhaps he just went
-on a different day than the rest of us. His “facts”
were not very reliable.

I would like to know how much time Moss
spent researching his article. I know for a fact tha_t
Mr. Rosenblum accompanied Mr. McKenzie when
he made his official statement to Jim Wolfe. the
University legal consultant. interviewed McKen-
zie many times. and was at the final meeting where
McKenzie and M Sgt. Bostwick met to draw up

,. the official statement of facts. These facts upheld

Mr. Rosenblum’s contention that McKenzie did not
give his permission to Bostwick to cut off the bu_t-

‘ tons. and the sergeant evidently agreed because he

signed the staspment along with McKenzie. It is
highly unfortunate that Moss did not attend this
meeting, so that he could have been as well in-
formed as Mr. Rosenblum.

Later in the article, Moss states that he does not
want theschool paper used as a literary mouthpiece
to further someone’( personal political aims. Of
what aims was he speaking? _Does he feel that Mr.
Rosenblum ‘used this article to have accredidation
taken away from ROTC? If this is Moss’ feeling, is
he suggesting that a columnistcannot give an opin-
ion unless Moss agrees with it.

Moss has inferred that Mr. Rosenblum has con-
tinually used the Pitt News as a literary mouth-
piece. He should note that this was Rosenblum’s
first article dealing with the ROTC issue. The
readers should note that this was Moss’ first article
that ever appeared dealing with any issue. If Moss
has been so disturbed by David Rosenblum’s arti-
cles, he should have joined our staff‘ long ago in-
stead of writing only’ one article that makes un-
foundedstatements. «

It is understood that when a columnist writes
anarticle forour paper, he can give his owh opin-
ion if he has thetruth behind him. Mr. Rosenblum
had this truth. Moss did not. And, I must wonder
who Moss is speaking for in his article when he
constantly uses the word “we.” If he is represent-
ing some group. it would have been nice of him to
to tell the rest of the students who they were. May-
be he just did not‘ have the courage to stand up
alone, and found it necessary to hide behind that
mystical plural pronoun.

I only hope that someday Moss will visist our
office and learn what goes into writing a column.
Maybe then he will ‘learn that a serious criticism
can only be supported by the truth. and not by sec-

- 0nd hand lies.

At the end of his column, Moss asked that rec-I
ognition now be given to the real Pitt student. If
he is an_ example of this creature, I fear this Uni-
versity is doomed.

{Politicians

Answer To The Issues

   
 

by.DAVE ANDREWS
Staff News Reporter
Maybe 'it’s impossible for a po-
litician to “fool all of the people
all of the time.” But judging by
the Nixon rally last Monday night.
many of those people are very easy
to fool.

Mr. Nixon's speech was full of
high - sounding. generalities. H e
made the kind of promises that po-
liticians have been making since
elections were invented. However.

_this_ didn’t seem to bother many

Nixon supporters who cheered him
after every other sentence.

What should we do about Viet-
nam? Mr. Nixon said. “Let’s help
them fight a war and not fight a
war for them!" Thunderous
cheers and applause from the
crowd. Remember what Johnson
said before the 1964 election? “We
aren‘t going to send American
boys to fight an Asian boys’ war!
And another crowd roared its ap-
proval and its votes helped elect
him President. ""\

Another Nixon promise was for
a move away from the draft to-
ward a n d all- volunteer a y m y .
We've heard that one a few time
before. Nixon said that “when a

. fourth-rayd power like North Korea

can seize a: US. ship, it’s time for

   

new leadership!” A few of us were
wondering how he would have
handled the Pueblo incident, or
prevented it. I suppose he didn’t
have time to tell us. '

Is there really enough differ-
ence between Nixon and Hum-
phrey to explain the wild enthusi-
asm of the crowd? I couldn’t un-
derstand why they kept cheering.
I doubt if they did either.

 

IIICII .\l||| M. I\'|X0.\l

Other Republican speakers pre-
ceded Nixon. Among them was
senatorial candidate Ric h a 1 d
Schweiker; the speech he gave was
a parody in itself. Schweiker call-
ed for “less political doubletalk
and more answers!" His speech
turned out to be political double
talk from beginning [to end, with
no answers to questions such as

  
  

' jwhy Schweiker.would__,be' a better:

    

senator_ than his opponent Joseph
Clark. ,

The Democrats, as well as thd
Republicans, try to hide the real
issues of the campaign beneath a
pile of sugarcoated wastel.A friend
of mine went to Humphrey’s rally
at the aNport while I was at the
Nexon meeting, and when she told
me about it later shecould hardly
stop laughing. ’

By her. description it was a real
emotional orgy of the “Politics of
Joy.” People were crowed into a
hangar at the airport. yelling and
waving signs around and singing
nonsense songs in praise of the
Democratic ticket.

Humphrey asked the crowd to
“sock it to him.” Nixon promised
'to"sock it to” the Democrats. Hey.
maybe these guys aren’t so bad af-
ter all. I mean th€.V kn0W how to
talk hip and everything.

The purpose of a political rally
is. after all. to get people involved.
Don‘t let them start thinking too

rmu.-h or it. might compromise their I

enthusiasm. Tell them jokes and
give them easy" answers to the
complex problems of the. world
outside the convention hall. Don’t
make them think any more than
necessary’. or they might start look-

ing for a dif‘ferent,leader.

Womren’s Judicial Board

Chm. Raps Allen Article

Editor, The Pitt News:

In reference to Peggy Allen’s
article which criticized Judicial
Board, I, as chairman, would like
to add a bit more clarity to the
situation. It seems that Miss Al-
len neglected a few details in her
little resume. It certainly is a
pleasure that Judicial Board has
had very fewcasesto handle
since last Spring. In fact, since
the new curfews had gone into
effect, we are happy to report that
we have had‘ only three cases of
lateness this term, two due to car

problems and the other Miss. Al- '

len’s. -

The women at Pitt should be
commended, for, as a whole, they
are all responsible young wom-
en. Therefore, it is entertaining
to me that Miss Allen complained
about Judicial Board, for she
holds a record of her own in that
she is the first case of lateness in
three years to appear before Ju-
dicial Board with the excuse that
she simply could not be bother-
ed; keeping track of the time. She
finally made the supreme effort
to look at a clock at 3:30 a.m. is-
n’t it rather strange that it took
Miss Allen 30 minutes to return
to McCormick Hall from Squir-
rel Hill in the middle of the
night?

I may not be a traffic expert,
but I don’t think that 3:30 a.m. is

the height of rush hour. Further-
more, Squirrel Hill is not exactly
50 miles from Oakland. There-
fore, I must agree with Peggy
when she asks, “Who’s going to
take the responsibility for my
life after I graduate? . . .”

Evidently, she still needs her
mommy to look after her, for
she certainly doesn’t- have the
sense of responsibility that other
dorm girls have. My goodness, if
a girl cannot be bothered looking
at a clock every so often, what can
she be bothereddoing? I agree
with Miss Allen that it’s really
sad when judicial Board is forced,
when we hear such an unbeliev-
able excuse, to question a girl ex-
tensively to search for a possible
logical’ reason for her lateness
which she may havevoverlooked
such as car trouble, a broken
watch, a date who refuses to
bring a girl back on time, etc.,
etc. This is to a girl’s advantage
and lessens, if not eliminates, any
penalty. Unfortunately, Judicial
Board‘ could find no logical rea-
sons befitting a college woman
for Miss Allen’s lateness. You’d
better start looking now, Peggy,
for someone to take the responsi-
bility for your fife, because the
next -two years will be.over be-
fore you know it!

Distortions In Moss Column

Attacked by McKenzie

Editor, The Pitt News:

When I\read Ed Moss’ letter in
last Friday’s Pitt News I got sick.

Ed stated that his version was

“what really happened at Forbes
Field . . .” Before seriouslv con-
sidering making a judgment as to
the validity of his statements, I
asked myself several questions.
Was Ed at the demonstration?
Did Ed contact the parties involv-
ed? He might have contacted
Sgt. Bostwick but he never con-
’ sulted or questionedme about the
incident, Can you write a “‘true
version” on ru m 0 r s and half-
truths? Well it seems to me that
that is just what Ed Moss did, and
I feel that the readers of the Pitt
News should know this.

Ed implied in his letter that

the demonstrating students were‘

the ‘Students for Peace. 1 am not
a member of that organization,
Ed, and the same holds true for
several other of the so-called
demonstrators. So Ed’s argu-
ment that Dave Rosenblum
wrote his article as “spokes-
man for the Student for Peace”

is ludicious M13 MOSS-

alsoi stated ; that Sgt. Bost-
wick “informed McKenzie that
it was illegal to wear official
Army buttons on an officer’s jack-
et . . .” How can Ed Moss over-
look the manner in which the ser-
geant “informed me?” Sgt. Bost-
wick walked up to me without
introduction and" grabbed me by
the front of my jacket and said,
“If you want. to wear that jack-
et, son, you’ll have to have "those
buttons removed." This is not the
way intelligent human beings
communicate to settle differ-
ences. ‘V

This is,n‘ot"the ‘way one person‘ .
informs.-another» of a wrong. no .,

  
  
 

nee 

  
   
 

my buttons; and I did not like the
misquo_tations that Ed assigned

' me in his letter, because I nev-

er said those lines.

In Ed’s letter he alsocriticized
Dave Rosenblum for describing
the incident as a “b1antant act of
assault.” As far as I’m concern-
ed it was a blantant act of assualt.
(I have 31-, witnesses who can at-
test this for‘ you Ed.) But maybe
in Mr. Moss’ mind this was not an
act of assault. Maybe Ed, vio-
lence is the best form of commun-
icationfand maybe he thinks vio-
lence solves differences. Well
that’s ok for Ed, and I won’t cri-
ticize him for it, _but,.;don-’t expect
me to feel that way_,., Don’t expect
me to consider such actions as
normal in human relations be-
cause to me‘, as‘ ‘Dave Rosenblum.
said, they are’ ‘_‘blantant acts of
assault.” ' 

/Ed also stated. “We -believe
that Mr. Rosenblum should be dis-
missed from the Pitt News staff
for gross misconduct and irres-
ponsibility.” Perhaps this is be-
cause Mr. Moss doesn’t believe
in standing up for the rights of
others as Dave did for me. Or.
maybe this is because Ed doesn’t

..-mt to read news that is distaste-

rul. If a faulty member violates V

the rights of a student this should
not be covered up and kept a se-
cret. /Iaybe l“. 2 feels that a news-
- .o.r should only report football
ga n fraternity parties, a n d
p a n t y raids. Dave Rosenblum
should have just turned his head
and forgotten what he had just
seen.‘But Dave didn"t because he
has guts. It takes guts to stand up
for a student’s, right as Dave did
for me and as i did for myself.
Or perhaps Mr. Moss feels that
the only right a student has is the

right tosay f‘yes.”, People have a. _

Editor, The Pitt News:

The Pitt News, by limiting its
coverage to some dozen topics
with a completedisregard for the
scope of affairs in this Universi-
ty, is abusing its position as the
college’s official newspaper. The
amount of space spent telling us
the latest leaden witticism of Art
“Bubba” Rosengarten or spent in
probing articles of the pilghts of
a lot of darned old grape ‘work-
ers who are of no interest or im-
portance to Pennsylvania students
might better be spend doing the

-job of a University newspaper.

There are a lot of highlights of
this University that are receiving
no or only minimal coverage. The
example which, as members, are
most familiar, with (and it is, by
no means the only one) is the Pitt

_ Marching Band. For an organiza-
. tion that works so hard (eight and

a half days in summer camp, two
nights a w e e k, and Saturday
mornings w h e n everybody is
sleeping), takes talent to gain and

«keep membership in, and has

acheived ‘respect and recognition
both on campus and nationally

- (they were, last year, rated the

third best band in the nation) the
only body left failing complete-
ly to recognize even their exis-

tence is The Pitt News. The News

is so busy telling us the private
lives of every leftest on the cam-
pus to spend its preciouspages on
the University that, thanks to the
“News,” manages to continue to
function in the dark.

The Pitt News must, evenif it
requires change in editorship,
learn to accept its responsibility
to present the scope of the Uni-
versity activities before it grants
any space to extranneous materi-
al. The Pitt News must take the
blame for its -failure to do so so
far. The disappointing silence‘.
from the “News” is a testament
to its present editorial policies.
Policies which are, in a word, un-
ethical.

(Dave Rosenblum attended this
meeting at my‘ request. He was
late for class to make sure my
rights were recignjzed sufficient-
ly.) Maybe I should inform Mr.
Moss as to the outcome of this
meeting. I wassatisfied with Sgt.
Bostwick’s apology and we shook
hands willing to forget the inci-
dent. When.I neared the end of Ed

Moss’ letter I was confronted
with more statements that caused
me to come out in defense of my
position and in defense of Dave

Rosenblum. Ed accused Dave of .

“taking the place of District At-
torney, a judge, and a jury.”

I think Ed has accused the
wrong party. I made the charge
that I has been assaulted, but un-

like the sergeant I did not take '

action against the offender. I did-
n’t cut his buttons off or take him
to court. I merely asked for an
apology and I got one. But fol-
lowing Ed Moss’ guidelines for
thinking, I could say that Sgt.
Bostwick was DA, judge, jury
and executioner in his treatment
of me at Forbes Field. But per-
haps you are unauthorized persons
executing the law and handing
out penalties, Mr. Moss. In that
case, because of what I consider

ter of Dave Rosenblum in Ed ‘

Survey to Evaluate Libr

by RUTH ZAPLIN
Staff News Writer

Would you use_the library if it were open Saturday night?
Would you like it to be opened early Sunday morning? What do
you think would be the best method to control the excessive and
unnecessary noise? These are a few of the questions-that the
Library Services Committee is now trying to answer.

The nature and purpose of this committee is to make con-
structive changes in library policy and promote student inter-
est. For example, in the past. undergraduate students were only
allowed to check out books for two weeks and renewal was not
permitted. Becauseof this committees efforts. books may be
checked out for four weeks.

This Monday and Tuesday. questionnaires will be available
in the library, the Towers. the Cathedral and the girls’ dormi-
tories. They will ask questions like those already mentioned.

“The only way that we can bring about changes within the
library is to show the administration that enough students are
not happy with present library procedures,” said Lynda Cahan
current chairman of the Library Services Committee. I

Stated Miss Cahan, “Most people are not aware that there
is a state law ih Pennsylvania that mutilation of books and per-
iodicals can result in instant dismissal from school” At present.
the committee is trying to devise Ways that will stop the muti-
lation of books and the building itself. Hopefully, the question-
names will provide some insight into successfully coping with
these and other problems.

The library will be open until 1 a.m. during readingper-_
iod and finals on a trial basis. It should be noted that student
support on this matter may help the Library Services Commit-
tee to institute these hours on a permanent basis.

  do your

contact lenses
C aclean life?

Contact lenses can be

heaven . .
may be a wonder of
modern science but just
the slightest bit of dirt
under the lens can -make
them unbearable. In
order to keep your con-
tact lenses as comforta-
ble and convenient as
they were designed to be,
you have to take care of
them.

Until now you needed
two or more separate
solutions to properly pre-
pare and maintain your
contacts. You would
think that caring for con-
tacts should be as con-
venient as wearing them.
It can be with Lensine.

Lensine is the one lens
solution for complete
contact lens care. Just a
drop or two, before you
insert your lens,coats and
lubricates it allowing the
lens to float more freely

in the eye's fluids. That's

 

. or hell. They ’

because Lensine is an
"isotonic" solution,
which means that it
blends with the natural
fluids of the eye.

Cleaning your contacts

‘with Lensine retards the

buildup of foreign de-
posits on the lenses. And
soaking your contacts in
Lensine between wear-
ing periods assures you
of proper lens hygiene.
You get a free soaking
case on the bottom of
every bottle_ of Lensine.

It has been.demonstrated
that improper storage be-
tween wearings may
result in the growth of
bacteria on the lenses.
This is a sure cause of
eye irritation and in some
cases can endanger your
vision. Bacteria cannot
grow in Lensine which is
sterile, self-sanitizing,
and antiseptic.

Let your contacts be the
convenience they were
meant to be. Get some
Lensine, from the Murine
Company, lnc.

discussion seminars; and a course
for credit were the five areas of
follow-up receiving highest votes.

The Sex and Sexuality Commit-
tee. presently recruiting interest-
ed members to its 4:30 p.m. meet-
ing in 210 SU. Thursday. is anxi-

ous to meet these student concerns.

Bob Feldman, a committee mem-

ber, is working with members of _

the Computer Center and the Psy-
chology Department on a formal
questionnaire for_ University stu-
dents to define specific areas of
misinformation or interest.

Associated W 0 m e n Students
(AWS) is planning to correlate
and edit .the information present-
ed in the talk by Drs. Sandra and
Daryl Bem on “The Demise of
Sexual Differences?” and th e
three panels, “Interpersonal Rela-
tions,” “To Bed or Not to Bed”
and “Human Sexual Response.”

‘ These print - outs will be m a d e
available to all interested students.

SIECUS (the Sex Information
Education Council for the United
States) has been contacted for in-
formation on college courses. The
Sex and Sexuality Committee also
plans to evaluat.e all University
courses which may related to sex
education and work to organize a
specific course dealing with sex-

 

uality from the sociology. -psy-W

chological. biological and spirit-

ual aspects. It is the committe‘s‘

hope that the course would be in-
terdisciplinary and of a pass-fail
nature.

Future speakers and program-
ing are being discussed. Work on
small seminar groups in conjunc-
tion with the Graduate School of
Counseling Education for next
term has been begun.

Judging by the forum question»;

naire response that 90 per cent of

the students found the forum in- .

formative and 81 per cent felt it
dealt with areas of concern to
them, Miss Grossi stated that the
committee’s concern for more in-
formation on sex and sexuality
seemed justified.

Further‘ work on distribution of
birth control methods (films and
booklets were available at the for-
um) is being done. Booklets on
contraceptives are available to in-
terested students in 210 and 522
SU. The committee. in conjunc-
tion with the University YWCA
and AWS, is working on a state-
ment criticizing penal code laws
limiting access to contraceptive

information and devices to won‘[__7“-

 Sorry Panthers Clobbered Again, 48-O 
  Dormant Miami OffenseAvvakens          

“ As Hap1essGridder Defense Wilts

by ROY JACOBS
Sports Editor
MIAMI, FLA. - There was a striking difference in the Pan-
_ ther’s post-game attitudes between the 63-7 loss to UCLA
 , six weeks ago and the 48 -0 loss to Miami here Friday night.

 

  
  
  

Six weeks ago, the team still had some pride. Though the opener,

but still had nine games to prove they were a good football team. Now,
after seven games -— and one measly victory — they’ve only proven that
they are either overrated, poorly coached, or don’t give a damn. In short.
they’ve performed like one of the worst teams in the country. ‘

At this stage, probably the biggest reason for losing- 48-0 is the
‘third one. The Panthers went down to Miami on the day of the game
rather than going down in advance, looking at sand and palm trees and not
playing football. But judging by their performances in the Orange Bowl
Friday, the Panthers were indeed distracted by their surroundings.

Or maybe they didn’t care in the first place. They certainly didn’t
care afterwards. Nearly half the squad frolicked around the pool or
in the ocean upon their return to the motel after the game. Others sat
and watched and joked. It was certainly different than their post-UCLA
attitude. ’ '

Maybe it’s best to forget about a 48-0 loss as soon and as easily as
possible“. Especially when there are no excuses for it. Miami is not seven
touchdowns better than Pitt and shouldn’t win by more than two touch-
downs. So why 48-0?

.. For one, the Fanthers wonly know how to be aggressive at ‘the
‘ - wrong times. Vince Opalsigy averaged 2.02 yards per carry against

everyone else, but against the Panthers he consistantly broke tackles

and averaged 5.9 yards a carry. The Miami running attack had netted

only 402 yards insix games before Friday night, but the Hurricane

offensive line blew the defense outtfor 210 yards. The Miami quarter-
" back was only dropped once all night.

Instead, the Panthers were aggressive only/v/vhen it hurt the most.
During each of Miami’s first four touchdown drives, the gridders
were charged with a long penalty at a crucial time. Three times the
penalty was a personal foul, once pass interference. All gave the Hur-
canes an added push when it was needed.

Not all the blame can be placed on the players, though. It’s the de-

. fensivecoaches that have them practice piling-on during the week. The

seems to learn is the piling—on. Perhaps you can’t teach agg_res's1ve-

Also. several weeks back the defense started using the standard
“prevent” defense (replace linebacker with ‘defensive back) on second
or third down with long yardage. It didn’t work particularly well against
Navy or Air Force, but it was employed again against Miami. It faked
the first four times it was used, and after that the game was out of

Actually, the defense did a fairly creditable job in the last 25 minu-

tes of the ball game, allowing only two Miami field goals. True, the Hur-

' , ricanes had their second team in the game, but so did the Panthers.
Fellows like Bill Ramos, Dave Montrella, and Ed Gallin didn’t have
reason to play hard, but they did. And it’s to their credit that they did.

Offensively, the Panthers suffered through their worst game of the

season. They managed only 10 first downs and 149 yards total offense.

‘Q (Leading pass receiver Skip Orszulak was only able to grab two passes,

although often-times heating double and triple coverage. It was just a
bad night all around. ‘

Only it was the sixth bad night of the season. The players have be-

come as complacent about losing as the fans. They just rolled over and

 played dead for the Hurricanes. What’s going to happen when they meet
 the two tough teams on the schedule + Notre Dame and Penn State?

Unfortunatdly, there are too many intra-squad animosities as

‘well as a lack of respect for teammates and coaches.If the team is going
to be respectable — forget about winning for this year — it’s got to

weed out those players who don’t want to play.

And it’s going to be a rough three weeks _for Dave Hart. Some-

where along the line he’s failed —— maybe in recruiting the wrong type of

They Call Him Bubba

Defense N o Joke F or ) Montrella 

by MA R~THA HARTLE

At Miami Friday night. the Hurricanes had the “Mad Stork,”
but the Panthers had “Bubba.” ’ '

Dave “Bubba” Montrella, a seconditeam defensive end, has
been a forgotten senior on the Panther defense. At six-feet, 195
pounds. he’s the smallest of the Panther ends and that’s how he
-got the nickname “Bubba. ”

“It’s just a joke.” explained Montrella. “Bubb:a Smith is a hugh de-
fensive end for the Baltimore Colts. When I wasswitched to defensive
end. the guys called me “Bubba" because of my size. I’m‘the smallest
of the bunch.” ’ __ _

players who want to play — not necessarily the most talented. At least -
then the team couldtakepride in knowing it did the best job it could

 

  
    

 

GENERALLY, QUARTERBACK Dave Havern (left) was rushed all I

good protection. Havem was only able to complete 7 of 22 passes
for 75 yards with three interceptions.

But despite his size, “Bubba”
Montrella saw a lot of action in
the second half Friday night and
he was credited with several tac-
kles. “When I got into the game,
it was pretty far gone,” he com-
mented. “We had a good bit of chat-
ter going out there and we had a
good time. By that time, a lot of
the pressure was off and some of the
guys weren’t worried. A lot of the
guys just had a littl3 fun in the last
quarter. I enjoyed it; I like to

play.”

Since coming to the University,
Montrella has gotten a chance to
play — at almost every possi-
ble position. He came in as a fresh-
man qua-Iterback, but due to thd
leao crop of recruits that year (16)
the frosh didn’t glay a formal sche-
dule and Montrella never got
a chance to show what he could

and missed all the spring drills.
“I went into fall camp my sopho-
more'year_ untried anywhere. so
they made me a split end. I was
back-up man to Bob Longo and
didn’t play much."

In the spring, the coaches mov-
ed Montralla to defensive half-
back and he stayed there through-
out his junior year. But this spring
with the innovation of the prowler
back, Montrella was moved from
defensive halfback to prowler.
“I got hurt_ playmgtnere and had
to ‘have a shoulder operation. Af-
ter the first few games this fall,
I moved to defensive end and I
like it at end. I’m getting to play a
little more.”

Montrella is one‘ of only nine

man class of 16 recruits. “This

“There wasn't a senior starting

“Ed Gallin was hurt. Now EZ

defense. but that’s all. On offense.
only Greg Ellis. Art Alois and Skip
Orszulak are starting. As far as
leadership and experience goes.
this definitely hurts us.“

It’s been a disappointing year
for Montrella and the rest of the
Panthers but “Bubba” still has
hopes of salvaging something.
‘-‘We have three games left and
we should try to salvage some-

thing out of a disappointing season.

Maybe we? A’c‘an"surprise somebody

  Booters Travel to Kent State,
1 Could Snatch Second Victory

by ED CONLEY

Coach Rudy Bachna’s Kent
State soccermen have won
three times as many games as
Leo Bemis’ booters, but the
Golden Flashes must consid-
er their 1968 season as poor
as the kickers’. The ‘two squads

’ meet tomorrow at Kent State.

Prior to the opening of the cam-
paign, the_0hio Collegiate Soccer
Association coaches gathered to
predict a champion. The Golden
Flashes were selected to finish
fourth, and given an outside chance
of taking all honors. '

Their present mark of three wins,

five losses, and one tie practi-
cally eliminates them from such a
finish. With only two games left
the Flashes are currently tied for
ninth place in the conference.

“They’ll be tough for us, though,”
Bemis related. “They have pretty

LO_U VIDA
Scored on Kent Frosh

good scoring capabilities.

“But,” the coach added’ “they
give up goals, too.”

The Flashes’ do play some high-
scoring games. They lost to Den-
ver in overtime, 5-4. a couple of

‘ weeks ago. But. the offense and de-
fense do settle down often enough
to keep the goals to a minimum.
The Flashes have come up with
17 goals this fall, while their op-
position has totaled 23.

The big offensive threat has
been Bill Swettenham. He was one
of the Ohio Association’s leading
scorers until last week. Before. the
Flashes hit the rough week (ond
loss and one tie) Swettenham had
two goals and four assists for the

tenth spot in the association’s scor-

ing battle.

“We’ve played against Swetten-
ham and (Daile) Van Patten for
two years,” Bemis mentioned,
“and they looked_ good.”

Van Patten has been the Flash-

tenham. Together, they pose
quite a threat to the booter de-
fense, which has had its share of
the work lately.

Bemis expects to use the 5-1-3-1
formation that he initiated against
West Virginia tomorrow.

“It wasn’t the formation’ that
hurt us against WVU; it was _the
simple mistakes,” he explain-
ed.

The formation adds strength
to the rear defense and keeps the
five men on the forward line. It
does, however, take away some of
the mid-field strength of the team.
Bemis leaves Norm Roux alone at
the half back spot, hoping that
Roux can do the job.

If the set-up can hold the Flash-
es scoring attack, maybe the boot-
ers can get their second win of the
season. Last year’s freshman
squad scored five times ih their

Bloated Wonder Tomorrow

by M. T. HEAD

Art “Bubba” Rosengarten’s magic picks once again topped
the Yogis this past-weekend, this time with a"10-4-1 mark.
Butthe bloated wonder’s success is in danger.

‘flf he doesn’t stop bragging,” moaned George “Moustachio” Lies,
“I might have to do something drastic.” -

“Moustachio” is in second place
still, iust five games behind the
fearless, leader; but what can he
do to “Bubba?” Strength-wise,
“Moustachio” couldn’t carry “Bub-
ba’s”" toe nails withoutgetting a
hernia.

“Mous'tachio’ is all talk and no
action,” said the bloated wonder.
“I’d like to see him do‘ something.
I’ll fight him at his own rules if
he wants, but'I’ll have to buy a wa-

g “Moustachio” is the most ac-
curate water gun shooter east of
Long Island Sound and-west of Eng-
land, but “Bubba” isn’t worried.

“I’m going to wear my skin-
diving clothes,” explained “Bub-
ba.” “It’s water proof.”

The showdown is tentatively
scheduled for 2:00 a.m. Tuesday
behind Chi Chi’s but “Bubba”
wants to fight at a different loca-
tion. The mindless Hawk center is
also an alcoholic.

But regardless of the location,
“Bubba” will be a favorite in the
match.

match,” explained Roy “Jumpshot”
Jacobs, “but he’s not a favorite
around here.”

Dave DiEmido hit the nets three
times, Lou Vida scored once: and
Randy Dry connected once in that
game. All of these players are on
the present kicker squad.

But,” Bemis cautioned, “they

kicmers who tallied the goals as
freshmen haven’t done any scorin —
as varsity players, either. _

Anyway, the soccermen may be

Cubs Oppose

PSU Frosh
Friday Night

The freshmen football team can
do what recent Cubs squads could
not Friday night at Forbes Field.

When the frosh gridders meet the
Little Lions of Penn State, they
will be trying for their second
victory of the young season. But
it won’t be easy.

The game, which is sponsored
by the Panther Foundation, pits

the Cubs against a proven power- ,

ful Little Lion eleven. The Penn
State frosh have also won their only
game, beating West Virginia,

.49-7.

The Cubs found it a lot harder
to beat the Little Mountaineers
ten days ago, but frosh coach Carl
Kokor will be looking for another
win just the same.

The Cubs have the remainder of
the week to beef up their offensive
attack. The passing game, in parti-
cular, needs improvement.

Against West Virginia, Cub quar-
terbacks failed to complete a
single pass. And the running attack
‘was also contained, with the ex-
ception of John Moss’s 119 yard
performance.

But the Cubs should be more ef-
fective Friday night. They now have
the experience of playing together
in a game situation under their
belts. '

“The boys always come up to
me,” beamed Kokor,” and tell me
that somehow the.y’re.going to win
it.”

by DAVE KUHNS

Staff News Writer
“Without sympathetic coun-
selors, professors, dormitory ad-
visers, etc., black students may as
well not be at the University of

Pittsburgh.’_’ '
In these words Dr. Donald
Smith, the University’s newly ap-

' pointed director of the Community

Education Program, character-
ized one of the main problems fac-
ingblack students on this cam-
pus.

Dr. Smith, speaking at last
Thursday's Student-Faculty lun-
cheon, told the gathering that he
was encouraged by “positive ac-
tion on the part of the chancellor
and others in the administra-
tion.” He-further stated that he
believes the University is “on
the move.”

“What I don’t see, however, is
a significant number of white stu-
dents supporting black students,”
Smith commented. He stated that
he feels that whites are drop-
ping out because blacks are for-
ming their own societies; that
whites no longer feel the “togeth-
erness” of the early 1960’s when
SNCC was formed. He added that
he hopes that more white support
will step forward and be recogni-
zed.

Smith, a member of the Black
Action Society (BAS) emphasiz-
ed that he was not an official
“spokesman for the BAS. ‘

In his closing remarks Smith.
stated, “We face a staggering
challenge here at Pitt, as we do
all over America. I intend to work
fervently for justice. Justice is for
all people to enjoy.”

According to Dr. Smith. statis-
tical techniques used in quality
control and process improvement
are being extended to other cost
areas such as wages. mainten-
ance. raw materials and ware-
housing. and require no additional
statistical training. He pointed
out that the use of statistical meth-
ods is one of the most wide-
spread tools in cost reduction pro-
grams.

travel some 44,000 miles overland.

The expedition originally was
planned as an individual research
venture by Dr. Jacob Aghassy.
assistant professor of geography.
Its scope was expanded when a
number of graduate students in
the department expressed an in-
terest in participating in the pro-

The group will study the geo-

tinent, attempting to correlate
ancient erosional surfaces in the
geologically older parts of South

conducted a three-year study of
the geomorphic development in
Africa.

In addition to its strictly
scientific goals. the expedition is
intended to contribute to the
