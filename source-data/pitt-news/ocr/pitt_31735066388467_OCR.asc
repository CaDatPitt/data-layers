Cacali, Vrana resignin food service audit

Byjim Tezak

and Scot Ross
The Pitt News

Following a suspension over two weeks
ago, Mary Cacali associate director of food
services, is resigning, according to
university spokesperson Tim Ziaukas.

Cacali, however, said she has only
pondered the move.

“I am considering resigning from the
university. I just don’t like the way they
handled the situation,” she said.

Cacali and Donovan Hughes, the director
of food services, were suspended last
month following a university investigation

into the Golden Panthers sports booster
club funds.

Manny Perry, manager of food services,
was fired for “mismanagement.”

“While there is no evidence of intentional
wrongdoing on Mary Cacali’s part, the
university lost confidence in the
management of the food-service operation
and has decided to do a complete
reorganization, replacing virtually the entire
university structure managing the Daka
contract,” Ziaukas said. ,

Daka, Inc., is the university’s food-service
contractor.

Ziaukas said that if Cacali had not

vice president of administration, threatened
to fire him, according to thepittsburgb Post-
Gazette. .

Yeager made his threat after confronting

Vrana about discrepancies found in the
still-incomplete banquet audit. The audit
revealed shoddy bookkeeping on Vrana’s’
part, including apparently improper
reimbursement of university officials for
trips to Las Vegas and the Grand Caymen
Islands. The audit also questioned the
whereabouts of thousands of dollars’ worth
of computer equipment purchased during
Vrana’s management of banquets and
Catering, reported the Post-Gazette.
Yeager is not speaking to the media and
is referring all calls to Tim Ziaukus of
University Relations. Ziaukus said Vrana

Pennsylvania’s House
Education Committee will vote
on an amendment to the Right To
Know Act on April 24.

State Rep. Ron Cowell, (D-
Wilkens), has introduced a bill
that would amendthe Right To
Know Act, redefining the status
of state-related universities.

Pitt, which is one of four state-

related schools, may be forced to
release police reports and salaries
of administrators and professors
as documents underpublic
record.

“The Right to Know [Act] applies
to state-related institutions
because of the amount of money
going into them. They should be
held fully accountable to the
state,” Cowell said.

Earth Day ‘9] events
setfor Fric/e Reserve

By Lynne Mosier
Stajf Writer

This year’s celebration of Earth
Day of Pittsburgh will be quieter
than last year’s 20th—anniversary
celebration at Point State Park,
which 70,000 people attended.

The 1991 celebration is planned
for April 21 at the Frick Woods
Nature Reserve, according to the
event’s co—chairperson, Harry
Mottsman.

“In comparison to last year, it
will be a little more quiet, but we
want to seize the momentum from
last year. We're looking for around
10,000 people to attend,”
Mottsman said.

Unlike last year’s event, Earth
Day 1991 is not an international
and national event, said
Mottsman. The Earth Day
Coalition hopes to make Earth
Day a major environmental event

been reinstated."

Cacali said that Pitt has promised
to reimburse her_for lost wages
because of the suspension.

According to Cacali, the charges
the university brought against her
were vague. _

She said that she was accused
of knowing about wrongdoings
within the food-service
department and not reporting
them. She said that she did
question people and reported

_several irregularities to the

university. She declined to

irregularities were. _

“It wasn’t against me at all. As
far as I’m concerned, I have no
idea of what they were accusing
me of. The university was very,
very vague. To this day I still don’t
know what it is they're accusing
me of,” she said. '

According to Ziaukas, three
other university employees
involved in overseeing the Daka
contract are also resigning. He
said that a total of seven people
are involved with the Daka
contract.

Cacali also said that she knows

Mottsman said the coalition
wants to chart the progress of the
environmental movement from
year to year.

“We’re going to lightthe fire
under the butts of the
environmental movement in
Pittsburgh,” said Susie Meyer,
_-chairperson of the Earth Day

“A Call to Actfon” is the theme
for this year’s event, which will be
issue-oriented, said Meyer.

“The coalition has spent a lot
of time building a membership
base. We’re not simply a group
that gets together for only one
event a year," Meyer said.

Earth Day 1991 will be
highlighted this year by Mayor

the Frick Woods.
Other events will include an

early birding hike, a children’s

program with puppet show, a
wildﬂower sale and many booths
with a spectrum of exhibits and
literature about issues such as
global warming.

The Coalition is asking for a $1
donation at the gate and $3 for

Earth Day Coalition.

ACLU bill would guarantee 0

students’ free

By Megan Bertino
Staﬂ" Writer

The American Civil Liberties
Union is backing a new bill that
gives college students the
opportunity to bring legal action
against a federally funded college
or university that attempts to block

-First Amendment rights.

The bill is being proposed in
the House of Representatives in
reaction to a recent survey
conducted by the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement
of Teaching.

The survey found that 70
percent of all colleges and
universities in the United States
have attempted to inhibit the
freedom of speech on campus.
The bill directly addresses rules
which prohibit hate speech and
speech critical of the college or
university. 0

Rae Jean Stephens O_f the ACLU
said the union is backing the bill

speech rights

because it believes, “free speech
needs to be protected, no matter
how outrageous or offensive it
may be.”

Stephens also said that
universities tend to think of
themselves as “their own little
universe” — free to make
whatever rules they like. But
students need to remember,
Stephens added, that even though
they are in college, they are still
citizens and are entitled to their
rights.

“Students have the right to be
able to express their ideas.
Whether Or not they are listened
to or whether or not they are
acted upon depends on those who
are listening,” said Stephens.

Dennis Donham, assistant vice
president of student affairs,
said the University of Pittsbugh
has no policy restricting
speech on campus and has no

plans for such a policy in the

future.

Cowell-

Continued from page 1
Popper said of Cowell’s bill,
“We have the legislation
under advisement.”

There are presently 14
state-owned universities
and 13 community colleges
which are under the
jurisdiction of the Right To
Know Act.

Other state-related
schools which would have
to» comply with the act are
Lincoln University,
Pennsylvania State
University and Temple
University. _

Cowell said that the

amendment to the Right T O ‘

Know Act is very simple
because it re—defines the
term “agency” to include
state-related institutions.
Cowell added that

support for the bill is strong,
noting that “mOre than half
of the [education]
committee has co-

_ sponsored the bill.”

  The year in review...

As the 1991 school year draws to a close, it’s time to
remember a few-“1andmarks” which made the past
semester what it was. V

On Feb. 6, Vice President for Administration John
Yeager decided that the public could no longer have
access to campus police records. “The campus police

. enacted this new policy as a way to ensure students’
identities are protected and to protect the university from’

lawsuits if the students’ identities are accidentally released,”
according to Yeager. The Pitt News then formally asked
the university community to join in the fight against this
decision. Our front-page petition was returned by
approximately 1,900 students, faculty and concerned
citizens. Our fight is not yet over.

1991 also marks the end of Wesley Posvar’s reign as
president of Pitt. Although the presidential-search

represented the entire student body. Considering the fact
that there are over 20,000 students at Pitt, one student
does not give the full representation that the students on

_this campus need. The search is complete, and we now
await the final decision.

Charles Bonasorte was once again harassed by Pitt, this
time for his phone number: 422-PITT. The university said
itwas a copyright infringement; he said itwas a conspiracy.
He fought the action and can still be seen selling Pitt
paraphernalia to the public. .

Kinko’s, too, faced a similar problem, when Pitt bought

out its Forbes Avenue location under Brackenridge Hall.
Kinko’s have since condensed its two Oakland stores into
one. Pitt, it seems, is attempting to own Oakland. For our
sake, let’s hope they don’t succeed. A -

The Black Action Society presented the university

-community with its 14 suggestions to make Pitt more
“recommendable” to black students. Among the factors
on its list were retaining and hiring black faculty members,
the appointment of a BAS member to the presidential
search committee and the expansion of the black studies
department. More investigation needs to be done before
actions take the place of words.

Many officials have left Pitt in the past year. The most
timely, however, is the departure of Ed Bozik, considering
the fact that Pitt is being investigated in the “Case of the
Missing Golden Panther Funds.”

Ah, and the war —-— the war which deeply divided this
nation. It gave protesters a chance to voice their opinions
about something in which they did not believe. That fact
alone shows the world that we are truly a free country;
a war a majority of the population supported could still
be protested without interference.

As always, this past year was a memorable one, and we

don’t doubt next year will be as exciting. See you then.

 

The stuff l’ve accumulated from
the past four years at ThePz'ttNews
fits nicely into three boxes, which
are stacked next to the filing
cabinet in my uncommonly clean
office.

Three boxes is a minimal space
into which to pack a college
career’s worth of anger, sadness,

confusion and satisfaction, so I’ve I

been given‘ another 15 or 20
inches to finish my house-
cleaning.

It’ll be strange next year not to
be shufﬂing around on the fourth

_ _ _ i floor of the William Pitt Union,
committee consisted of many members, Lisa Campoli 4

mentally creating some obscure
responsibility or rationalization
not to attend class. I’m done. By
the time anyone picks up the
paper today, I’ll be unemployed.
It’s OK, though; I’m not leaving
empty-handed. Besides the three
boxes, I have a lifetime of
anecdotes and, yes, memories of
my Pitt News tenure. I do have
some regrets, though. I wish that
there were some stories that we
as a newspaper could have done.
With a little help from the
university community they might
have/been front—pagers. In no
specific order, they are:
Committee formed to re-
evaluate undergraduate

education — Pitt will examine ~

the priority it gives to
undergraduate education with

sweeping improvements in the,

works, according to Pitt President
Wesley Posvar.

Posvar has formed a committee
which includes over 100 members
of Pitt's administration, faculty,
staff and student body to change
what he calls “a deplorable,
cyclical situation where we have
worried more about the prestige
of a few outstanding individuals
and ignored the vast majority of
students who want a simple,
dignified undergraduate
education to enable them not

. funding

only to get a job but also to speak
with pride about the quality of
the academic experience at Pitt.”

The committee will look into
such Pitt academic deficiencies
as the low priority given to
undergraduate‘
education, the low percentage of
minority faculty and the retention
rate of black students, Posvar

, said.

“These are all combatible
problems. The administration is
just going to have to rethink its
mission,” he said  _

Posvar tells Trustees to
release police reports — In a
sharp contrast to statements made
in the last month, Pitt President
Wesley Posvar moved yesterday
to open the campus police records
to the scrutiny of the public.

“What have we got to hide?”
Posvar said during his report at
the Board of Trustees meeting.
“After all, if the purpose of a
university is to educate, maybe
the students will learn through
the mistakes of their peers.”

Posvar has drafted a letter to

send to the Department of.

Education, in which he will
challenge that the Buckley
Amendment, which threatens the
federal funding of a university
that releases a student’s
educational information, does not
apply to police reports.

“I welcome the media of the
city to help me in this fight for
freedom of the press,” Posvar
said 

Students unite to form one
collective voice, promise
action — Leaders representing
117 student groups and
organizations at Pitt have decided
that united they stand, divided
they fall, in creating asingle
unified student voice to combat
problems on campus.

The coalition, which will ,
represent some 20,000 students I
at Pitt, is demanding equal
representation at all meetings,
including Senate Council and
Board of Trustees meetings. The
students have threatened to shut
down the university if their
demands are not met. I I
- “If there were no students, there
would be no university,” a
spokesperson for the group said.
“We have finally ﬁgured out that
only together can the student of
Pitt really effect a change. ...”

Maybe someday. Maybe’ if
people get a grip on reality for
just a second, things can change.
Maybe if people stop finding
excuses for their own
inadequacies, it will eliminate
some of the racism, hypocrisy
and general stupidity of our
microwave, VCR, cellular-phone
society.

Now that I’ve hopped off the
end-of—the-year soapbox, let me
take this opportunity to thank all
the people who helped make
ThePz'tt News an interesting place
to hang my coat. There are some
things I’ll miss, many things I
won’t, but I can’t say that I’ll ever
look at things the same way.

I'm going to go have a beer
now, but keep those cards and
letters coming.

Scot Ross was the editorin chief
of The Pitt News.

The Pitt News extends its congratulations to
all graduating seniors. Good Luck!

" I know nobody cares, but:

-Not that we haven’t had
enough war to last us a while, but
it seems that one of our allies is
getting just a bit antsy with its
neighbor and longtime
antagonist.

South Korea’s defense minister
announced Tuesday that his
country was thinking seriously
about launching a commando
raid against North Korea to take
out a nuclear facility just outside
of Pyongyang, North Korea’s
capital.

.Needless to say, the North
Koreans aren’t exactly thrilled

’ with this prospect. In fact, one

government official called it “an
open declaration of war.”
Wonderful.

This reactor, which could\

possibly produce nuclear
weapons as early as five years
from now, could, pose a major
threat to our allies in the south.
Unfortunately, North Korean
leader Kim Il—Sung has some
experience in war with South

W/ee-hoo’s and

 

Jeff
Tatusko

Korea: He kind of started one
back in 1950.

Of course, saying that your
country is thinking about a raid
on your enemy doesn’t exactly
strike me as___ brilliant, either.

Launching it, however, would be

less so. Here is a case_where
something should be done to the
North Koreans, like maybe
sanctions or strict regulations of
their "nuclear capabilities. The
North Koreans just might be
willing to cause their own little

" “mishap” in the south. Thatwould

be very bad news.
’ -.Is it me, or do the Kurds need

, a new name?

-Now that the semester, is
coming to an end and students
aregoing home, does this mean

that the campus will suffer less
from crime?,Oh, I forgot; there is
no crime on this campus, ‘cause
John Yeager said we don’t need
to know what’s going on. ‘

-Well, I’m done giving my
opinion on current events for
now. Since this is the final issue
of The Pitt News before the term
ends, there are a few people who
deserve some form of gratitude.
After all, it’s because of them that
The Pitt News exists.

making it so easy to think of an
idea for an editorial and even
easier to think of a position to
take.

contributed to this section. It
made it a hell of a lot easier on
me to read good, thought-

a chance to catch up on my
“ideological deficiencies.”) It’s

-Thanks to Jim T ezak for his
well-developed insights in our
editorial meetings.

-Thanks to Mike Rampa for
teaching me how to be sensitive.

-Thanks especially to the
readers of my section. You might
not have liked what you read
(and from the number of letters I
received, many of you didn’t),
but criticism helps, believe it or
not. It helps me, at least, to see
other points of view, which is

making us realize that their posts .. something that this section strove

for this year.

-Thanks to Zinger for making
my job much easier (even when
I don’t have the center spread).

-Thanks to the copy desk, for

making my section look good in .

print. Even if the paper was used
to line bird cages, at least itwas
grammatically correct.

-T hanks to the South Oakland

expansionist behavior, again, for
givingme editorial ideas. _

helping me through the tough
times.

Here comes my end—of—the—year, end-

of~my—college-career boos and wee-hoos '

column. This is my totally self-serving way
to say goodbye to some, good riddance to
others. '
Boo  to John Yeager, who in his
infinite wisdom thinks he's doing what’s
best for everyone at Pitt. Not only has he
denied usthe right to smoke where we
want, he has also taken away our right to
know. Perhaps he should apply for a
position as a world police officer since
Bush has relinquished that title after the
annihilation of the Kurds. V

Wee—h0o  to Lisa Campoli, who took

a lot of crap when she really shouldn’t
have. Lisa did a great job, and I think the
students at Pitt owe her a great big ol’
thanks.

Wee-hoo  to the new Student
Government Board. After three years of
lame boards, it’s good to see some people
who have a genuine interest in living up
to their campaign promises. See you all in
the funny pages!

Boo  to the person who makes up the
prices for our tuition and books at Pitt. For

 

Jessica Coville

the highest in-state tuition in the country,
you’d think it would even out somewhere.
Last time I looked, robbery was a crime.

Wee-hoo  to the nice lady in the Book
Center who read all of my articles and
columns and told me she liked them, even
if they were better used as a ﬁsh-wrapper.
Thank you.

Boo  to the people who physically and
verbally harassed the peace demonstrators
during the war. Your ignorance and lack
of respect for a contrary opinion was
frightening. I trust that you remember
somewhere down the line that when you

take my rights away, youlre taking yours
away too.

B00  to.Mayor Sophie Masloff. You’re
damn lucky that CNN didn’t get a hold of
the videotapes of your police officers
beating the shit out of those Deadheads.‘

Wee"-hoo  to Mayor Sophie Masloff. At
least you started the recycling program
(albeit a couple of months late).

Boo  to Governor Casey for restricting
significantly the right of a woman to
choose to have an abortion.

Wee-hoo  to the Black Action Society
for being loud about the hypocrisy at Pitt
and for not being afraid to point out the
roots of the problems.

Boo  to Penn State. Boy, I’m glad I
transferred to Pitt before Mrs. Paterno had
to sit in the end zone and Joe got all pissed
off.

Wee-hoo  to the copy desk at ThePitt
News. The copy readers put up with all of
my obscenities and references to oral sex
for three years, and for that they deserve
a real big WEE—HOO!! (Look up the spelling
for that one.)

Wee—hoo  to BiGALA for its important

role in education and visibility of gay ._

rights. _
Boo ... to Tom Lester, who hasn’tre_alized

that this isn’t the 19503 any more (nor is it

the 19605).

Wee-hoo  to the staff at WPTS, 98.5l

FM. Simply the best college radio station
in the country. ' /

Wee-hoo  to Tim, Tim, Mindy, Jason
and Val. You don’t have_to like John
Denver to live in Colorado with the ice
queen. ' «

Wee-hoo  and a sad goodbye to the
editorial and writing staffs of ThePittNews.
I will truly miss you all, if not for the
companygthen for the endless hours of
amusement. ,

Wee-hoo  to Pitt. Yeah,-we pissed you
off but we know you read us every single

I wasn’t going to write a last
column, «but then I figured, if
every other graduating senior up
here is writing one, then I would
too — sort of peer—pressure
column writing. ‘

So with that in mind, I’d like to
take a little stroll down memory
lane and try to jog a few people’s
memories. (The reason I don’t
write more perspective columns
is because I’m full of bad cliches.)
For those of you who have had
the pleasure of attending this ﬁne
institution for the past four years
— as I have — maybe this will
bring back some of your own
memories.

OK, so here’s a list of my top
six experiences at Pitt (1 love
lists): _

-Running on the field and
jumping’ on Hub after the Pitt-

Penn State game in 1987. Yes, we
were a bunch of drunk bastards,
Big S. '

0Standing and cheering the
entire time at the Pitt-Oklahoma
hoops game in 1989. The student
section should have been like
that at every game. Few people
realize what a special place
Fitzgerald Field House is to watch
a basketball game.

Can you tell I’m a big sports’

freak yet?

-The Sick Weekend at my place a

last year. It was a bonding thing.
0The past four Opening Days,
but especially last year’s.
-Trivial Pursuit, vodka and
Kool-Aid lemonade. A
oTequila!
There’s a lot of things I'll miss
after graduation. Some of these
things can no longer be enjoyed

Jirn Tezak

at all; others just won’t be the
sameionce I’m no longer a Pitt
student. Here's another list:

-Two—dollar pitchers and Dr.
Space and the Sleaze.

-Uncle Sam’s Subs.

-Late-night Sports Trivial
Pursuit.

°J.C.

-The back nine at Schenley.

-Pitt hoops.

oPeter’s Pub.

oThe ubiquitous one.

-Playing tennis with Barchie.

There are also more than a few
things I won’t miss. Don’t worry
if you're getting bored; this is the
last list, and..I’ll try to keep it

short: _

0 Late-night/early-morning
rotisserie drafts. Who, says
Domingo Ramos is a bum?!

-J.C. ’

0 Late-night studying.

0 C.J. ’s.

0 Getting “O” fries after the bars
close. My stomach hurts just
thinking about it.

-Writers who miss deadlines.

0 Professors who enforce
deadlines.

Well, there it is. Four years of
college condensed into a few
inches. Things sure have changed.
When I first came here, cheese at
The “O” cost 43 cents, and Darnell
Dickerson was quaiterbacking the
Pitt football team. Now the once-
pathetic Pirates and Penguins are
both division champs, and the
campus police want students to

at fona’ memories of Pitt

think that there is no crime at Pitt.

I have benefited in many ways
from my experiences at this
university. I've learned the art of
doing just enough to get by in my
classes and discovered that all-
night drinking binges just aren’t
conducive to attending morning
lectures. I've matured from “O”
fries to Uncle Sam’s mushroom
cheesesteaks with fried onions

J and mayonnaise.

And I owe it all to you, Wes.
Thanks. Butl still have one more
request before you and,I both
take our leave from this esteemed

” Year in Review

By Jenifer Crook
Staff‘ Writer

   
   

   
    

Students discovered during the last academic year that the
University of Pittsburgh will soon be changing in both personnel
and landscape. Over the next couple of years, Pitt will have a new

I president, a new athletic director, a new dormitory and a new multi-
rnillion—dol1ar International Center.

Other events which touched the campus include these:

0Over the summer, three Pittstudents were raped in their
Oakland apartments, and a fourth rape occurred in September.
After pleading guilty to two of the rapes on Sept. 11, 16-year-old
Antoine Hamilton was sentenced to serve up to five years in

Lorri Johnson wasn't even supposed to
play this season. In fact, she had already
earned her place on Pitt’s Varsity Walk
between the Cathedral of Learning and
Heinz Chapel after receiving a Panther
Award last year.

She had to fight the NCAA to regain this
final year of eligibility, and she was granted
an appeal that resulted in her reinstatement
before this season.

Johnson made the most of this
opportunity and closed out an outstanding

career at Pitt, becoming the Lady Panthers’
all-time leading scorer with 2,312 points.

A S-foot-11-inch forward from New
Castle, Johnson averaged 23.0 points and
9.1 rebounds this season while becoming

. the Big East Conference's all-time leading

scorer with 1,199 career points. She was
named All—Big East Conference, All-Big

In her final campaign, Johnson led" the
Lady Panthers to their best season since

she said, “but I should be all‘

By Derek Willis
Staﬂ’ Writer

The loudest applause at last
Sunday’s Dapper Dan Roundball
Classic wasn’t for first-team high
school All-Americans Glenn
Robinson or Chris Webber; it
was for Orlando Antigua.

Antigua, merely a second—team
Parade All—American, was the
only Pitt recruit to play in the
Roundball this year.

Despite being nervous, the

’ future Panther contributed six

points, six rebounds and a game-
high four blocks to his East team,
which lost to the West squad

104-103.

“You don’t have a lot of time to
warm up before going in the
game, so I was forcing things a
little," said Antigua.

“[Antigual— played well, but he
looked a little nervous,” said
Dapper Dan East Coach Steve
Smith. “It was hard for him to get
into the flow of the game.”

In the pre-game warmups,
however, the 6-foot—6—inch
forward looked very comfortable,
throwing down dunks from every
possible angle as the the people
crowded around the court to
watch the ritual.

The game itself featured a lot of

running and scoring, which
Antigua likes. “It was fun. They
let us play; they didn’t call too
many fouls,” he said.

One of three Panther recruits
this year, Antigua played his high
school ball at St. Raymond’s High
School in the Bronx, New York.

This season he averaged 15
points and 10 rebounds a contest,
numbers which may pale in
comparison with other players,
but St. Raymond’s is a team
loaded with top-ﬂight talent like
teammate Terrence Rencher,
who is headed for Texas.

Antigua is something of a
diamond in the rough, since he

didn’t play organized basketball
until his sophomore year in high
school.

Essentially a post player in
high school, Antigua should see
college time at small forward,
which won’t be a problem,
according to Smith.

“Orlando is very versatile; he
runs well, bangs underneath and
is an extremely hard worker," he
said.

He is also very unusual in one
respect: He has a bullet lodged in
his head. I -

After being mistakenly shot
outside a store in the Bronx by a
store owner, doctors decided that

removing the slug would cause‘ -

more harm than leaving it in’.

Smith likes Antigua’s chances
as a future Panther. “He’s going
to be very good. He’s really a
hard ‘worker and ,a nice guy,”V
said-Smith. .

Antigua will be one of several
Dapper Dan veterans on the Pitt
team next year.

Sean Miller played in 1987; Eric
Mobley played in 1989, and
Jermaine Morgan played lastyear.

Former Panthers who have
participated in the Roundball
include Darelle Porter, Brian
Shorter, Rod Brookin, Charles
Smith and Demetreus Gore.

Williams qualiﬁes for N CAAS at Dogwood Relays

By Sharon Kerestes
Staﬁ“ Writer

’ The Lady Panthers’ successful

team showing last weekend at
the University of Tennessee’s
Dogwood Relays was highlighted
by the performance of sophomore
Allison Williams, who qualiﬁed
for the NCAA Championships and
set a new school record in the
100-meter hurdles.

Williams’ time of 13.56 seconds 3

in trials was fast enough to qualify
for nationals by provisional
standards and to break the record
of 13.76 she set last year as a
freshman. She ran a 13.81 in
finals to place eighth overall.
Keisha Demas and Ronise
Crumpler have alreadyqualiﬁed
for the NCAA Championships in
the 400m dash and as part of the
_4 x 1600m relay team along with
Clarissa Dudley and Kim Blair.
The fact that Williams joined
this group is not surprising, since
she had already accomplished

the feat during the indoor season. ‘

Her goal is to make it to the finals
in the national championships. “I
still have to get my time down,”

right."

Carmela Mariana added another
record-breaking performance for
the Lady Panthers in the S,000m
run.

Her time of 17 minutes, 18
seconds shattered the old record
by almost 20 seconds. 3

Kim Blair was 10th in the 400m
hurdles; Stacey Wyzykowski won
the open 10,000m; Cathy Chrissos
was third in the open 1,500m;

and the 4x100m relay team of

Crumpler, Williams, Dudley and
Demas was sixth.

The Lady Panthers’ nationally
ranked 4 x 400m relay team did
not compete because Crumpler
was injured. “Ronise is having

it might be best just not to run,”
Coach Steve Lewis said. “We had
a good time coming into the
meet anyway, so we figured we

. wouldn’t take any chances.” The

University of Florida, he pointed
out, won the event with a slower
time than Pitt’s best.

 

The Dogwood Relays pre-
sented its own special challenge
to the Lady Panthers because of
the number of hi gh-caliber teams

that competed.

“Every meet has its own
personality,” Lewis said. “The
difference in this meet was that

there was more competition. You

there will be a team or two that

Wide receivers look to
bench to provide help

By Rob Pugliese
Staff Writer

When describing Pitt's 1991 receiving corps, the words most
often uttered are “young and thin."

This position is shorthanded, because the team is currently -

without the services of last year’s top three wideouts, Olanda
Truitt, Darnell Dickerson and Ricky Turner, a trio that accounted
for 86 receptions, 1,502 yards and 10 touchdowns last season.
These three sat out spring practice because they violated team
and academic standards.

Spring drills provided a golden opportunity for another
group of talented but inexperienced receivers to establish,
themselves for the the upcoming season. Among them are
senior Chris Bouyer and redshirt junior Junior Green.

Bouyer, 6 feet 2 inches and 190 pounds, saw increased
playing time last season. He understood the importance of

- precise execution in Paul Hackett’s complex offense. “It’s all
about how you execute your routes. The better you execute,
the better receiver you'll be,” said Bouyer.

Green, 6 feet 1 inch and 190 pounds, will.a1so be a major
contributor to this year’s offense, despite missing most of the
spring drills with an injury. Green is _very pleased with the.
group’s progress and is enthusiastic that the wide receivers will
open eyes in ’91.

“As a group right now, we are very thin and young, but
during the spring we’ve improved a lot,” Green said. —f‘Billy

When Steve Fisher coached the University of
Michigan to the national title in 1989, he seemed to
be on top of the college basketball world. He was
undefeated as a head coach and was a national
champion in his first season. In the past two years,
however, Fisher’s Wolverines have faltered.

In the 1989-90 season, Michigan returned four
starters from the championship squad but failed to
advance past the second round of the NCAA
Tournament. The recmiting class he brought in that
year left many people wondering if he was the right
man for the job.

No one is wondering any longer, however—— not
after Fisher’s recruiting class of 1991. Michigan
signed five players, all of whom are rated among
the top 100 players in the country.

“Michigan is back; these kids will contribute
immediately,” said Steve Smith, coach of the East
All—Stars at the Dapper Dan Roundball Classic.

The group includes the four Parade All-
Americans who played in the Roundball last Sunday
at the Civic Arena: Chris Webber, Juwan Howard,

Jalen Rose andjimmy King. Webber and Rose were '

the leading scorers for their teams Sunday, while

Howard and King were key contributors. ,
Webber, a 6—foot-10-inch forward/center from

Detroit, is generally considered the top prep player

THE PI'I'l' NEWS, Thursday, April 18, 1991

  Michigan recruits include four All—Americans  

in the country. A four-year starter at Country Day
High School, he led his team to three straight state
championships, scoring over 2,500 career points
and pulling down over 1,300 career rebounds. In
the Dapper Dan game, Webber scored 22 points
and had eight dunks.

“He’s a great talent,” said Smith. “He does some
things out there that are unbelievable.”

Joining Webber at Michigan is his friend Jalen
Rose, who played at Detroit’s Southwestern High
School. Rose averaged 24, points, 11 rebounds and
seven assists this. year, contributing. to
Southwestern’s second straight state title.

and spectacular dunks, Rose's scoring was quiet: a
lay-in here, a turn-around jumper there.

“Sometimes Jalen doesn’t look too pretty out
there, but he just plain gets it done,” said Smith.

The third member of the Dapper Dan group
bound for the Ann Arbor campus is Howard, a 6-
10 center from Chicago. Howard scored six points
and grabbed six rebounds in the game, but he also
had the unenviable task of guarding Webber most
of the time. 7

King, a 6-4 shooting guard from Texas, rounds

out the bunch. King averaged over 25 points a 

game as a senior in high school and is renowned
for his all—around athleticism. In the Dapper Dan
game, King scored 12 points on six-of-10 shooting
and also dished out five assists.

Bruce added that Johnson’s

season. Playing with a lineup that
often featured three freshmen,

geared to stop her, and nobody
could ever do it,” Bruce said.

. “I really enjoyed playing on a -
young team, helping out the
younger girls, and I’ll look back‘
at this year as a learning

Shorter performs for NBA scouts at Orlando Classic

By Brandy L. Simms
Staff Writer

Pitt forward Brian Shorter was among
several NBA hopefuls competing in last
weekend’s Orlando All-Star Classic, a post-
season camp designed as a talent showcase
for professional scouts and general
managers.

The Classic gives players a shot at
improving their draft positions. One of
three post-season camps that takes place
before thejune draft, Orlando is considered
the camp where an individual’s
performance can have the greatest effect
on his potential pro career.

Tim Hardaway, Hersey Hawkins, Stacey
King and Dee Brown all raised their

professional stock by turning in solid
performances in Orlando and benefited
ﬁnancially.

Shorter was hindered last season by a
viral infection and averaged only 13.6
points, compared to 20.6 the previous
year and 19.6 his sophomore year. Many
doubted whether he would even receive
draft consideration. In Orlando, he may
have silenced the doubters.

The teams were divided up between
the four regions: East, West, South and
Midwest. I

Shorter played on the East team and
was one of four Big East players competing
in the Classic. The others included
Providence guard Eric Murdock, Seton
Hall's Anthony Avent and LeRon Ellis of

Syracuse. All four Big East competitors
played for the East. Rounding out the East
squad were LaSalle’s Doug Overton, Darrin
Chancellor‘ of Southern Mississippi,
Slippery Rock’s Myron Brown, Keith
Hughes of Rutgers and Ohio State’s Treg
Lee.

The three-day event, which began last
Thursday, featured the four teams playing
a total of six games under NBA rules in a
round—robin format.

In the East team's first game, a 112-105
loss to the West, Shorter scored 11 points.

However, the next day he scored 18 as
the East defeated the Midwest 116-103.
On the ﬁnal day of competition, Shorter
pumped in 17 points as the East edged the
South in the championship game 113-110.

A 1 

Several players decided to skip the 
Classic, opting not to risk a poor 
performance and possible injury that would 

lower their potential draft position.
Among the no-shows

Carolina, New Mexico 7—footer Luc Lon gley,
Missouri’s Doug Smith, Michigan State

guard Steve Smith and UNLV’s fantastic 

foursome of Larry Johnson, Stacey

Augmon, George Ackles and Greg 

Anthony.

Of the 36 players who participated in
last year’s Classic, '29 were drafted, 15 of
whom went in the first round. Twenty‘-
seven are currently playing in the NBA.

[Davis] and Chad [Askew] are
coming along real well, and the
vets have improved a lot, too.”

Askew and Davis are a pair of
redshirt freshmen who have
earned high ‘marks from the
coaching staff for their
performances this spring. They
will be counted on to lend some
depth. to this spot in the fall.

At 6 feet 5 inches and 210

of the fastest players on the entire 4

Panther team, having been timed
at 4.3 seconds in the 40. He spent
last season adjusting to the
position after playing both
quarterback and defensive back
in high school.

“Billy and Chad both were hurt
this spring, which hurt their
development, but we're very
pleased with their progress,” said
wide—receivers coachjon Gruden.
“They have excellent physical
skills and are ‘improving

Bouyer and Green both feel
that the conditioning, strength
and overall speed of the group
as a whole has improved, but
they emphasized the importance
of being fundamentally sound.

Gruden, who is in his first
season coaching the receivers at
Pitt, echoed these sentiments.

"The attitude is great. What
we’re doing with this group is
creating an identity," he said.
“I’m sure we’ll line up with a
couple of guys who are ready to

The receivers have one distinct
advantage over most other corps:
Alex Van Pelt. “Alex knows the
offense well and will get the -ball
to the open guy. It’s really a
privilege for them to play in this

poffense,” Gruden said. “He is _

probably better coached than any
other quarterback in the country.”
Hackett also praised the efforts
of his receivers.
“We lost Junior Green early,
but Chris Bouyer has had a good

spring all the way through. Losing

Askew an opportunity to gain
some experience," Hackett said.
According to Hackett, redshirt

sophomore Warren Ware and

walk-on Jasen Larabee also had
good springs.

Byjessica Coville
Asst. Managing Editor

Drawing upon a wealth of bi-
coastal musical talent, the core
members of Pigface have set aside
their billboard competition with
each other in hopes of enjoying a
new freedom not found in their
earlier projects.

“We have to tip our hats in the
direction of Al Jorgenson,” said
Martin Atkins, whose past
inﬂuences are Killingjoke, Public
Image Limited, Ministry, Brian
Brain and Lunar Bear Ensemble.
“He put many members of Pigface
together on the Ministry tour.”

Atkins said he and Bill Riellin
(Ministry and Revolting Cocks)
felt frustrated at not being able to
exchange ideas during the tour.
“We were just merely recreating
Ministry songs, which was

exciting, but was artistically
frustrating ultimately.”

Immediately after the Ministry’s
“The Mind is a Terrible Thing to
Taste” tour, Atkins and Reiflin
went right to the studio. “It was
very crisp, clean and somewhat
intimidating for some people.
Some of us are used to a few
weeks of rehearsal before you go
and spend $150 an hour [for]
studio time,” said Atkins.-

Pi gface has a core of incredible
talent, ranging from Atkins,
Connelly and Reiflin to Ogre
(Skinny Puppy), Paul Raven
(Killing Joke), William Tucker

(Ministry) and Matt Shultz, who '

invented a new instrument called
the ATG. _ S I
Along the way, other artists
will be joining the Pigface tour:
Trent Reznor, who has enjoyed

'an enormous success with Nine’ ‘

\

the freaks of the industry

Inch Nails; En Esch from KMFDM,
Paul Barker, from Ministry and
Revolting Cocks; and David Yow
from Jesus Lizard. Atkins said‘
that open invitations have also
been sent to Paul Fergeson, Iggy
Pop and Flea.

Chris Connelly, whose work
with Ministry and Revolting Cocks
has left him with a strong and

'1 loyal following in the United States
and Europe, said he left Ministry

because of the strict discipline.
“I played keyboards and sang
live. You‘ have your parts, and
they're very intricate and difficult
songs to work with, and you’re
basically playing someone else’s;
music,” said Connelly. "Lyrically
they were my lyrics, but I was
given a certain framework to work
with them, and I got really hacked
off with that after a while.”
Connelly, who has just

completed a solo album, loves
the freedom of Pigface. “I was
suddenly in the studio not being
told what to do and how to do it
 I’m a lot freer with Pigface. It’s
a loose environment, and I’ve got
a lot more freedom to use my
voice.”

The EP Spoon Breakfast,
released prior to the album Gub

from Pigface, contains 11 songs‘

ranging from Wax Trax influences
to deathly jazz. There have been
some questions about the names
of the album and the band. The
name “Pigface” came from Atkins,
whomaintains thatit was the first
band he was ever in. (He said it’s

something about the lead

guitarist’s wife.)
Spoon Breakfast had some

1 critics (questioning about drug

references. “Pigface is not drug-
induced mayhem, [although]

 

  

there is a modicum of alcohol

involved, ”A said Atkins. A
Atkins is passionate about not

being musically pigeon-holed.

“The records we’re,making'exist .

purely because we want them
to,” said Atkins. “They’re not
manufactured for any
exploitational reasons.”

Atkins draws his aversion to
commercialization from

‘ experience with PIL. “Ifyou listen ‘ _ 

to Metal Box, it’s dangerous
exploitation of repetition
hypnosis,” said Atkins, who left
PIL in 1985. “If you listen to PIL

now, it’s just pop for money,

It’s actually a damn shame that
something so beautiful had to
end up so ugly. No, it’s not the
steamy relationship you’ve had
all year with some poppy boy or
tarty gal or the sudden public
disclosure of Nancy Reagan and
Frank Sinatra’s nighttime bong
sessions. Nope, whatwe got here
is a major breakup of the original
Manchester junk fiends,
SPACEMEN 3.

Sure, we’ve known the band

years, but thistime it’s definite.

as Peter Kember and, for a brief
period, Peter Gunn) and Jason
have sunk in a fiery crash, similar
to the one in which an oil tanker
that went down off the coast of
Genoa, spewing rubbish into the
murky waters.

Jason seems to take on a
defeatist attitude by contending
that it’s over and “it really doesn’t
matter to me -now.” Sonic, in the
other boat, lowers the boom.
“Jason has always modeled
himself —— his tastes— after mine.”
Wait. We haven’t hit bottom yet.
“Jason will continue to milk
Spacemen 3 for all it’s worth
because he needs to. Everything
he does will continue to be a
pastiche of Spacemen 3
forevermore. ” Sounds like he just
got stiffed on a prom date.

Now that we’ve got all the
good British rag out of the way,
let’s move to the real groove —-
the methadone-laden guitar licks
and haunting vocals that make
up the Spacemen. In case you're

as 3, don’t bother. Hard drugs
have a way of making you see
threes. Actually they started out
with three members (they added
bass vibrations manipulator
Willie), but they have had
numerous guests on each of their
four recordings, all of whom get
little respect aside from the mere
credits.

Forget the sudden Manchester,
or Madchester, craze that's
sweeping the globe. The

Spacemen were years —— light _

years — musically, ahead of the
hyped-up, ecstasy—infested
crossover dance ﬂops that have
media goons flocking like
migrating birds to their ripped-
off beats. Basically, the Spacemen
don’t have a beat,but they’ve got
beautiful, repetitive, psychedelic
guitar sculptures, not in the pop

‘ vein that has become England’s

'second—favorite rave (e.g., Lush,
Kitchens Of Distinction).

All of this is of major importance
because Spacemen 3 have a new
record out. Of course that’s open
to your view of what time frame
constitutes new. The record has
been done since June, but a funny
thing happened on the way to
the studio. Jason and Boom
recorded their songs separately
because of their third—grade hatred
for each other. So side one is all

minimal, low-impact, hushed
euphoric stuff, with the exception

The Frampton Brothers show you the

By Dave Vucenich
For The Pitt News

Who and what are these
Frampton Brothers? Could they
be ’70s super rock god Peter
Frampton and his long—lost
brothers casting a nostalgic
shadow On the local rock scene?
Fans hoping to catch a glimpse Of
old Pete himself might sell out
the Frampton Brothers’ Shows.
But unfortunately, the pop/rock

’ quartet’s popularity has been

rather grim in this area. (Besides,
they aren’t even related to Peter).

If you’ve seen a Frampton
Brothers show, then you know
thatsmall crowds dOn’t keep them
from having a swell time.

“At our last show I was really
excited, ’f says Si_nger/sOngwriter/
guitarist Ed Masley, with widened
eyes. “I went home with bloody
knees and a ripped-up shirt.”

“We want to make sure it’s
musically good at the Same time

r - as being entertaining," adds lead

guitarist/singer/songwriter Sean
Lally. “A good live show is where
I’m suspended by a pulley, riding

through the audience playing a A

guitar.” I

Masley elaborates, “We take .
, the audience along with us, too.

We make them part of theshow.

And we honor all requests.-
“One show, there was this guy

who kept screaming out for the

‘Allman Brothers, but we didn’t

know any, so we toyed along
with him like, ‘This is a song from

    
     
         
       
       
       
   
           
     
     
     
       
   

Dear students, faculty and staff:
On April 7, 1991 The Pittsburgh Stop.(ou'tsid
vendor) celebrated its 2nd Anniversary. Two years-
ago we started with 4 styles Of Pitt sweatshirts. Today
we have Over 47 differentPitt majors, 12 different
Sport designs, along with all Of the other traditional
designs. In all, we have Over 85 different Pitt designs
On sweatshirts —‘— the largest selection On the Pitt
‘ campus and, we believe, the largest Selection
anywhere. .MOSt Of these designs are also available
On tee Shirts. We carry 24 different hat designs at all
times, including Pro-Style fitted hats. We also carry a
full line Of shorts and Sweatshirts.
Our success is due to the overwhelming
support of the students’, faculty’s and staff’S
patronage. In addition to the patronage we have
received, we would also like to thank everyone who
supported us during the revocation Of our vendors

“And then he was like, ‘Ya

know any Skynyrd?’ And I start-

playing ‘Sweet Home Alabama.’
I couldn’t remember any Of the
words, and the guy comes up on
stage, and suddenly he’s
transformed into this wanna-be
rock star. He starts strutting
around like Mick Jagger Or
something,” Masley said.

“He had this weird—1OOking
woman with big hair with him
who was on her toes clapping
her hands the whole time he did
this. When he was done, he got
Off stage, put his arm around her,
and they walked Out, the door.
Like that was it. I think we
possessed that man’s soul.”

“That’s the effect this band has
on people,” Lally says ardently.

Masley concludes, “When it

mass-appeal band. We’re going
to appeal to people like us across

Scotland’s iColperCozz'lZz'a a new banshee Wailing in the wind

Byjessica Coville
Asst Managing Editor

Joining the sirens and sylphs of
the Celtic musical landscape that
had previously been haunted by
the likes of Enya, Runrig and
Clannad, Capercaillie from
Scotland is the new banshee
wailing in the wind.

Capercaillie, the band's second
album following up on the huge
success of the 1987 release

H‘ Cascade, is a stunning display of

Scottish folk rock with a bit of the

Celtic ethereal entwined in its

textured-format.

The six-piece band has
garnered high acclaim in the
United Kingdom for its keen web
of melancholy, woven by such
traditional instruments as the
accordion and Irish fiddle with
electronic keyboards and a wind
synthesizer.

The strong appeal of
Capercaillieand of the band itself
lies in its use of the Irish and
Scottish Gaelic languages. Such
songs as “Alasdair Mhic Cholla
Ghasda" and “Ian Ghlinn’ Cuaich"
are testaments to the strong roots
of the Celtic culture of the United
Kingdom and are a wonderful
escape from the innundation of
drum machines and DATs used
by most Top 40 bands today.

Karen Matheson’s striking
vocals send shivers down the
spine while achieving a rare
harmony amidst a flurry of Irish
reels and Scottish jigs. Her work
is often compared to that Maire
Ni Bhraonain of Clannad. (But
that's all right; the bands are
friends.) The Irish Post describes
Matheson as “one of the most
beautiful voices in traditional
music today.”

Manus Lunny also .joins

Scotland's Capercaillie mixes Celtic tradition with New Age technology for a lush heavenly sound.

Matheson with vocals but is better
known for his work with the
bouzouki, a Greek stringed
instrument. Lunny claimed in a
recentinterviewthathisbouzouki
concoction was “sort of likejimmy

Shand meets Jimi Hendrix.”
Charlie McKerron is the
notable fiddle master whose
work on the track “Balindore” is
dizzying and inspiring.
Originally a biologist,_ he was

the Golden Fiddle Winner in 1983
and was quickly _picked up by
Capercaillie.

“Revolution” early last summer.
 The Jason side is better, with
each song a shimmering cathedral
of subtle energy and bliss. I tend
to prefer the Jason cuts on all
three of the Spaceman’s previous
releases because they tend to be
a bit more diverse in their beauty

'-— not as blatant as Boom’s drone.

Don’t fret. Jason has started a
new band, Spiritualized, which
released a single last summer
and is due for a full—lengther
sometime soon. Meanwhile,
Boom has started his own label,
BOP-A-SONlC!, and has started
up his own outfit with producer
Richard Formby (Telescopes, Pale
Saints).

Rahsaan Roland Kirk
The Man Who Cried Fire
Night

At the endlof The Man Who
Cried Fire, Rahsaan Roland Kirk

. tells an audience that he wants to

be reincarnated as a musical note.
“That way nobody can capture
me. They can use the hell out of
me», but nobody can steal me.”
Roland Kirk was a jazz musician
with a lot of spirit, as the
aforementioned quote indicates.

T Anyone who would add Rahsaan

to the beginning of his name
(after having a dream about being
called by that name)‘must be.
Although he was blind from a
young age, Kirk went on to
become a musical innovator. He

was the first jazz musician to play
two or even three Saxophones at
once without making it a novelty.
He also pioneered a style of flute
playing in which he would sing
through and play the instrument
at the same time.

Kirk’s live albums are great
listening because they often
include bits of dialogue between
songs that show what a great
storyteller and funny person he
was. Fire is_no exception.

At the beginning of “Bye Bye
Blackbird,” Kirk tells a story about
meeting Miles Davis, and he does
a hilarious and perfect imitation
of the trumpet player. '

Before another song he tells
the audience about how it
frustrated him that people never
took his sax playing seriously
and thought he was more of a
showman.

CD, taken from live tapes owned
by Kirk’s former producer Joel
Dorn, shows that the man was
anything but a novelty act. It
samples all of his styles, from R &
B honking (the classic “Night
Train”) to his ﬂute playing/singing

(“You Did It, You-Did It”) to his ,

underrated and recorded clarinet
playing (“Slow Blues”).

The setback of The Man Who
Cried Fire is that a number of the
tracks are just fragments and not

complete songs. It seems as if -

Dorn cared more about
introducing all of Kirk’s styles to
a new audience and thought it
wouldn’t matter if some of the
songs appeared only in brief
snatches.

Regardless, the CD is a great
find for anyone interested in this
great underrated cat. '

Denver's frothy The Fluid carries o

By Tim Azinger
Managing Editor

Another heady Sub Pop band
is about to break into the big
leagues. Following in the
footsteps of Soundgarden,
Screaming Trees and Nirvana is
The Fluid; it’s a little cleaner than
most of the Sub Pop grunge but
powerful in its own right.

The Fluid formed six years ago
out of the remains of two local
Denver bands: The Frantics and
White Trash. James Clower
(guitar), Rick Kulwicki (guitar),
Matt Bischoff (bass) and Garrett
Shavlik (drums) began jamming
together and eventually .decided
upon John Robinson as their

It wasn’t long until Sub Pop
took notice of The Fluid’s
historically analogous musical
style, which packaged tidbits of
The Stooges, Alice Cooper, MC5
and The Who into a frothy,
updated version of punk rock.
Robinson’s yelping vocals and
wiry stage antics bring back fond
memories of Iggy Pop slithering

Glitterhouse Records, The Fluid
made a smooth transition to Sub
Pop with Roadmoutb. Released in
1989, it placed The Fluid on the
heavy-hitters list. It managed to
carry on the Sub Pop tradition
without layering its upbeat
melodies and lyrics under heaps
of noise and sludge.

 The Commitment and‘ The
 Etiquette of Mourning will be
I’ performed.

»Kathleen George, associate
professor of theatre arts, acted as

 " supervising producer of the lab
 series and commented on the

beneﬁts of the playwrights’ seeing
their work performed. “It’s- an

  important process of working on
 a play I don’t know of a writer

who doesn’t revise after seeing

 his or her work performed.»

Shakespeare and Moliere worked
with a company of actors.”
George said she is very pleased

 

POLICY

The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)
clearly discriminates against Lesbian, Gay &
Bisexual armed forces personnel.

‘ Most typically, gay and lesbian
service members face discharge proceedings
because their mere presence in the military
violates the DoD policy, irrespective of the
quality and length of their service. Military
personnel with sparkling service records who
are discovered to be gay or lesbian can
suddenly be swept out of the military only
' because of their sexual identity.
This policy of discrimination is
irrational and senseless, and it results in the

 . , persecution of thousands of good soldiers and

sailors every year. Mere suspicions of
homosexuality can ruin careers and often
lives. It is damaging to the individuals and to
the military.

FACTS  

Investigations of alleged lesbians or gay‘ men
are unrelenting. Military investigators follow
service members off base, open letters from
secured mailboxes, and leak news of the
investigation to colleagues.

 

with the plays, which should be
viewed as works in progress. The
Etiquette of Mourning by Stan
Denman and directed by George,
concerns a Texan family of
women dealing with the death of
a patriarch. It is noteworthy for
the strength in Denman’s
characters, according to George.

The shows on Friday and
Saturday will be presented by
Peter Harrigan and the Acting 3
and 4 classes. Mental illness is the
commo_ri theme of both of the
dark comedies Where ’sM0m?and
The Commitment. Cathy Focareta
wrote Where ’sMom.?, a play filled
with bizarre, dark humor about
mental illness and the animosity
between two sisters as they vie
for their mother’s attention.

In The Commitment by Steve
Gaydos, the grown children test
their mother’s sanity during their

ARE YO A GAY R.O.T.C. CADET?

lnterrogators attempt to force confessions, lie
about what information they have, present
written statements of guilt ready to be signed,
and may even threaten loss of child custody
or family estrangement if the servicemember
will not comply. -

IF YOU ARE BEING
INVESTIGATED

If you are in the military and being
investigated, LEARN YOUR RIGHTS! Only by
using your rights can you help protect
yourself from an unnecessary or bad
discharge. Remember these rules:

SAY NOTHING!
SIGN NOTHING!
GET A LAWYER!

FIGHT BACK!

Take these steps:

1) KEEP QUIET/SIGN NOTHING — Anything
you say, or initial can and will be used against
you. Military investigators are paid to
convince you that they are your friends -
DONT TRUST THEM! Remember —- No one
can order you to say, sign or initial anything.

father’s absence. “It’s a test of
sanity of all sorts and asks whether
it’s saner to freak out than to hold
on,” said George.

Neil Briggs’ Climbing concerns
the conversation between the best
friend and girlfriend of a suicidal
young man. Only a portion of the
play is being performed. A
number of scripts couldn’t be

performed because of special_

effects and length.

“I’m really glad students are
producing so much. Every student
has his or her forte,” said George.

The Etiquette of Mourning
will be shown Thursday and
Friday at 12 noon. Climbing and
The Commitment will appear
Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.
Where’s Mom? will be shown
only on Saturday. All perfor-
mances are in the Studio Theatre
of the Cathedral of Learning.

 

2) DO NOT GIVE NAMES — You may be
asked, and even pressured, for the names of
people you think are lesbian or gay. GIVING

NAMES WILL NEVER, EVER HELP YOU.
3) GET CIVILIAN COUNSEL — You have the
right to civilian counsel, but you have to find
it and pay for it yourself. You should talk to
civilian counsel before you talk to a military

lawyer and before you do anything else.
4) GET A MILITARY LAWYER - You have the
right to a military lawyer and you should get

one. However, a few instances have been
reported of military lawyers breaking client-
lawyer confidentiality. If you don't like the
attorney assigned to you, you may r equest
another one.

later in the month and features
bands like The Young Fresh
Fellows, The Wishniacs and
locals The Cynics.

The songs on I Am Curious
(George) reﬂect the attitudes
and disposition of the band.

“‘New Dog’s Day’ is about
the aging process of a former
disco king, ” Masley deadpans.
“It’s probably one of our most
serious songs.”

“It’s a terribly sad song and
needed to be written,” adds
Lally. “I don’t think a song has
ever been written about the
subject?”

“Sand” has “shoes and
giggles” recorded from people
in an Audiomation studio,
where it was produced, for an
added Beach Boys’ effect. It
also has a neat piano trail-off
ending.

The songs create kind of a
“Kinks meet The Young Fresh

Fellows in a barnyard”—type'

atmosphere. ‘

Masley, a critic for The
Pittsburgh Press, a record
buyer for a downtown recoid

, store and a former member of

Johnny Rhythm and the Dime
Store 453, played acoustic
shows with Lally prior to the

current formation of the band.
It now includes bassist Dave
Vandervoort and new
drummer Bill Haller.
(Drummer Doug Blair played
on the recording and will play
his last show on April 19.)
They gained the name
“Frampton Brothers” by sheer
spontaneity.

“My friend and I walk into a
cheesesteak place,” explains
Masley, “and some guy goes,
‘Damn, it’s two Peter
Framptons. You look like the
Frampton brothers.’ And I
said, ‘Wow, what a great name
for a band.”’ ,

The Framptons next take
their name to the stage when
they play their record (OK,
CD) release party April 19, at
the Electric Banana.

Aside from all the Frampton
ferreting and fun, Masley likes
to dream about his own
aspirations.

“My personal goal for the

next ﬁve years is to goto Palm
Springs and co—write an album
with Sonny Bono — get
together with some people and
co-produce the Sonny Bono
comeback album.” Show me

When he studies late at night,
Esper is more inclined to listen to
the likes of David Bowie’s “Ziggy

Temple Spirits. .

However, make no mistake
about Esper’,s musical tastes —
his ﬂuctuating style is what makes

“Industrial? Naaah. That word
is thrown about way too much
these days, especially over here,"
said Connelly about the texture
of Gub, the band's first album.
“Pigface for me is experimental
music. Personally speaking, I’d
call it surreal over industrial.”
“If you took the concept of
Pigface to its logical conclusion,
I could send four art Students out
doing charcoal drawings, and it

could be Pigface,” said Atkins,
who added that that possibility of
that was unlikely. “It’s anything
we want it to be.”

Atkins and Connelly both have
a great time with audiences. “The
wildest audiences I saw were in
Australia, where they would make
a decision in the first 5 minutes.
‘Do I like what’s going on or not?’
and if the answer was yes, they
