Complaints concerning .the misman-

sulted in action by the. Junior class.
‘In an effort‘ to satisfy the ‘desires,
of a majority of the class, the

. Junior Class ‘Cabinet has‘ consulted ’

the authorities- on student, activities
in the University.’ They are of the
opinion that the solution to this
‘I.‘l‘0bIel11_ lies in the centralization of
directorship of all activities under
the leadership of one individual. By
this plan, all student activities, "ex-’
cepting athletics, would ‘be ‘placed
under the leadership of . a. graduate-
manager, ‘whose powers and duties
would be as extensive as‘ those of
the graduate ,manager‘ of athletics;
'1‘-his centralized system» -has been
employed successfully in other
schools and the 7 majority of the
members of the Junior class -believe
that it would be more than satisfac-
tory in the University. -Accordingly,
Wednesday, April 27, has -been de-
clared Graduate Manager Day, Dur-
ing. this day a. copy of_the following
petition will be placed in the offices
of every school of the University, ‘i_n-
cluding those -not on the . campus:

“We, the undesigned, realizing that
student activities «have not progressed
as etfed’tively as other activities of
the University, and believing that
the graduate manager plan will solve
this problem,‘ do hereby petition the
chancellor, J. G. Bowman, for a
Graduate :Manage'r to control all stu-
dent activities excepting athletics-—
our'-reasons for -so doing being ‘that:-
“Firstly, because he would develop
conditions in a business like manner,

progress, having, had the lasting
-beneﬁts of a. ﬁeld of experience.
“Secondly, under his guidance in-
ternal friction would be reduced‘ and
gradually abolished. . ‘,
“'l‘hirdly, useless‘ activities ' that
did , not promote the better interests
-and‘ welfare of the school ‘could be
abolished upon his recommendation.
,,Fourt-.‘hly, he will have the check
on I all student managers and activity‘
leaders and will be able to make
them abstain from anything that
would be detrimental to the inter-
ests of the activity concerned‘. He
will relieve the animosity caused by
the present committee controlling ac-
tivities. , ..
“Eifth1y. that} he will direct all ac-
tivities in such a manner to pro-
mote harmony, co-operation and suc-
cess so that eventually these activi-
ties will rival their fellow athletic ao-
’tlviti‘es in prominence and will boost
the spirit of the University and in-
crease the student morale."_
All students of the University are
urged to sign this petition. 5

 IIARVAIIII‘lEBTUREII

Constitutional reforms introduced
into India by ‘the »British government
since the ‘close. -of the World War,
the operation of these changes, and
the pblitical problems which they‘
have caused, were discussed by Prof.
Erich Home in his address Ilast.Fri-_
day “noon on “The Diarchy in British
India," in the Heinz‘. House. The meet-
ing was conducted‘ underjthe auspices
“orf“fthé"I Pitt Inte‘rnIational“ "Relations

advisor of that ' organization, pre-
sided. _  I 

In its eﬁorts ‘to introduce an ex-
tensive measure of self-government.
into India the‘British ,g,o:1§ernment ..‘wa‘s, ’
according to the-‘ s ker, -confronted
by the following di _ lties:- 1‘. That
of maintaining the foundations of I law
and order, during the process of trans-
ference of powers ; 2, how to harmon-
ize the executive and legislative func.
tions so as to make thelatter rep-
resentative; 3, how togprovide for/a
gradual advance toward complete
home rule. ,‘ I 

The solution, Prof. Home declared,
was found in the following policies,
wliich, he added, have been given a_
trial for 10 years andghave stood the
test, namely: 1, the. ‘creation of a‘
popular electorate; '2, provisional
autonomy; 3,I- division between‘ re-
served ‘and transferred subject; 4,
revision at the end of 10 years. '

Scores of graduates who visited
Alumni Hall's housewarming made
special inquiry as to the heating and
‘ventilating plant, which was univer-’
sally commended as one of the most
attractive features of the building.
Added interest is found in the fact
that this installation was made by an
alumnus, J,  McGinness, Eng.’ '95,

Since -his graduation, back in “Old

pressed their appreciation of his co-.
operation at Alumni Hall and their
conﬁdence in the effectiveness of his

NEW HEADS FOR. THE WEEKLY

 

New hands will take The Pitt Weekly helm after this week.
Faithful service thus gets its rewardin the highest positions on The
Weekly staﬂf. In announcing the appointments of Maurice H. Gold-
stein, Charles R. Williams and Joseph S. Crisswell_ to the positions
of Editor-in-Chief, Managing Editor and Business Manager, we be-
lieve the destinies of the paper are placed in charge of the most com-
petent men available. Their records of ability, industry and integ-
rity should be causes of pride to them, -and while their work on the
publication is not carried on in the glare of the public eye and in
the blefre. of public applause, the satisfaction they derive from the
knowledge of tasks well done must be sweet to them.

They receive, as a heritage 23. -college newspaper that does not
suﬁer by comparison with  others of its class, a sheeththat early
this year was threatened by bankruptcy but is now meeting its ob-
ligations promptly. With their heritage a charge is included—a
charge to take these four pages and, under the stimulant of better
times ahead, make them what they used to -be, a weekly eight-page
reflection -of Pitt life. Success to them! _

The retiring oﬂicers have nothing but regret as they step out.
Tim-,es were when »discoiuragement, criticism, misunderstanding and

lack of co-operation made their read anything but a path of roses‘.

Those were the times when the honor of heading" a student activity
was submerged by the difficulties connected with managing it. But
it was all in the game and the retiringexecutives go with something
akirrte sorrowas they see one ~chapter=of=the_ir university life closing.
Enough of looking ‘back The,’-‘future is the thing.
M. E. H.
