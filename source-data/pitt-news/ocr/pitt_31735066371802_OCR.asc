Pharmacy has hopes of survival

By Lisa G. Gordon
The Pitt News

Discussions about the School of
Pharmacy’s fate are almost over,
and Jerry Cochran, assistant vice
president of health sciences, and H.
David Bergman, the school’s assis-
tant dean, are optimistic about the
school’s chances of survival.

“The University Plan: 1985-1990"
stated on Nov. 29, “We recommend
that the school be phased out start-
ing with the next academic year.”

This recommendation came from
the fifth subcommittee. They
defended their position by pointing
to the fact that the school’s direct
costs exceed its revenues by
$900,000. They also cited the low
ratings they gave the school in terms
of centrality and comparative
advantage. But, after much discus-
sion and deliberation, a set of pro-
posed changes has been drafted by
the school’s administration and
faculty, and it seems to them that
these changes are workable. Coch-
ran, the school’s liaison in talks with
administration, stressed that all of
these following changes are only
proposed and not definite. He said:
“The first change involved would be
the reassignment offaculty presently
housed in the School of Pharmacy
to another division of the university.
Basically, the faculty whose exper-

tise and talent can be used in another
school would move. _ '

“It will only be a net change of two
faculty members. Six faculty would
be moved to another division and
four new faculty would be brought
in. We are thinking of a clinical
pharmacist and a pharmaceutical
science teacher."

The Five-year Plan recommended
dropping the number of faculty
from 35 to 27.

Another change would be an
increase in the number of students.
According to Cochran, the school
will increase the number of students
from 400 to 450. Bergman blamed
part of the financial problems on the
small senior class. “Part of the rea-
son is that we have ‘a senior class of
62 and usually have around 100,” he
commented. .

If the average student pays an
annual tuition of $3,300, 50 more
students would boost revenues by
$165,000. Using this $3,300 average,
the present 400 students put
revenues at $1,320,000; 50 more stu-
dents would increase the amount to
$1,920,000.

Even with this boost in revenue
from larger classes in the future, the
school will have to cut costs. Berg-
man explained: “Today people look
at the university as a business, and
they feel we are spending too much.
We will have to budget and run the
school more efficiently.”

But this is‘only if the school is

saved. The decision will be made on
Feb. 28 and published shortly after-
ward. Whatever the outcome, the
school will have 30 days to appeal
the decision, according to Cochran.
“The president [Posvar] will enter-
tain additional comments made
within a 30-day period,” he said.

The optimism of the school is
illustrated by the fact that prospec-
tive students have been accepted for
the 1985-86 school year. As of Feb.
13, 1985, 185 students have been
acce‘pted,'according to Bergman. He
said: “This is an increase. We usually
have around 140. The number will
level off around mid-March, and we
estimate around 110 students will
come.”

The process of making a response
to the Five-year Plan began when
Cochran became liaison for the
pharmacy, dental medicine and
health science schools on Dec. 18.
Discussing his position and duties,
he said: “My purpose is to work with
faculty groups in an attempt to
develop two things: first, each
school’s responses to the plan, and
second, a set of recommendations
from the office of vice-president to
provost.

“I met with the deans and assist-
ant deans of allthree schools to dis-
cuss and explain how we should
respond. I made a request to the
dean that we should involve the
faculty as much as possible and that
everything should be open. I had a

meeting with the faculty and
extended an invitation to talk to me,
personally. I thought it was a possi-
bility that maybe they weren‘t get-
ting to say as much as they would
like. So I told them if there was any
feeling they were being denied, they
could have direct access to me. Soon
after, I had groups of faculty coming

Reagan’s
cuts will
cost Pitt
students

By Susan Benedek
The Pitt News

The $2.3 billion reduction in
financial aid for college students as
proposed by President Ronald Rea-
gan in his 1986 budget may mean
“survival of the fittest” for Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh students, warned
Paul Cukanna, assistant director of
admissions and student aid.

The proposals, if passed by Con-
gress, will induce financial changes
for the 12,771 full-time undergradu-
ates and 5,077 graduate students at
Pitt. .

"The proposed reforms are
designed to stem budget hemorrhag-
ing by reducing excessive subsidies
to students,” according to a report

released by the Office of Manage- '

ment and Budget. “The reforms are
necessary to correct policy and
budgetry impacts of an unrestrained
20-year binge,” explained the OMB.

If student aid is reduced, the cuts
would affect everyone, particularly
those from middle-income families,
said Kevin Altomari, associate
director of admissions and student
aid. '

Both Cukanna and Altomari
doubted that the cuts will go
through Capitol Hill “as is.” How-

ever, they both emphasized that stu- _

dents should expect and prepare for
reductions in aid from the federal
government.

"Acquiring an education involves
many sacrifices, especially financial
sacrifices. In the future, students will

Mrs. Jackson says
activism will go on

By Mary Daigle,
The Pitt News

Some might have thought that
after the campaigning of the 1984
presidential election was finished,
the life of Jacqueline Jackson, wife
of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, would be
restored to order. That is not the
case, said Mrs. Jackson as she spoke
at Pitt Friday afternoon.

Jackson was in Pittsburgh to
speak at the first annual Salute to
Afro-American Women. The stop
was only one in a series of her recent
tour of the United States to promote
American assistance to Ethiopia.

Mrs. Jackson has continued her

extensive traveling and political
activism, which includes her trip to
Ethiopia in January. “In the past
several months I have seen war in the
Middle East and the threat of war in
South America, but the situation in
Ethiopia was the most moving and
staggering to the human imagina-
tion,” she said.

“I don’t understand how we [the
U.S.] can be equipped with our
advanced technology in communi-
cations and still not know of the
drought in Ethiopia. I don’t think
that could take place anywhere but
in a dark country," she said.

According to Jackson, in order to
find a solution for the famine, which
she says will affect more than 150
million people, the United States

must intervene. “America has the
power and the resources to make a
difference in a land where people are
dying because they can’t even get a
drink of water."

Jackson attributes the different
political conviction of the Ethiopian
government from that ofthe U.S. as
the reason for limited involvement.
“People have the right to differ polit-
ically from the United States. We’re
not God. It is not our job to act as
the police to the governments ofthe
world.”

Focusing on the issue of civil
rights, Jackson feels that the activ-
ism of the black youth in the late 60s
and early 70s is not as visible in the
black youth of today. “The 79 per-
cent unemployment among black
youth is as high as it is because of
their reliance on social programs.
They are perpetuating generation
after generation of unemployment
and apathy,” she said. “We need to
realize the greatest assets people
have are human resources. Once we
have a sensitive president we can put

America back to work.”

When the question of her hus-
band’s political future was raised,
Mrs. Jackson assured the audience
that he would continue his active
participation. “We received a man-
date from the people. They‘ said,
‘You run, Jesse, and you tell the peo-
ple »what we’re thinking.’ He
accepted that and will continue
along the same course. Iconsider my
husband the president ofthe United
States in exile," she said.

Chemenko

votes

MOSCOW (UPI) — The
big sensation on Soviet television
yesterday was a shot of an aging,
wheezing man in a blue suit and
striped tie casting his ballot in
national parliamentary
elections.

The man was Soviet leader
Konstantin Chemenko, and it’s
the first time the Soviet public
and the rest of the world have
seen him in eight weeks. He had
been officially described as ill,
and the reports circulated that he
was near death.

The Soviet television footage
shows a slightly‘ unsteady Cher-
nenko accepting bouquets of red
roses from a fellow Politburo
member and wheezing out a
“thank you." The shots, how-
ever, do not show Chenenko try-
ing to walk, a possible indication
that he needs assistance.

In Brief

Western reporters did not get a
chance to see Chernenko vote.
The first word came when Soviet
television broke into its regularly
scheduled programming to show
the 73-year-old president.

Bloodshed
Lebanon

in

(UPI) —— There was more
bloodshed in southern Lebanon
yesterday. Israeli and U.N. offi-
cials said Israeli troops killed
nine suspected Moslem guerril-
las and arrested a number of oth-
ers in raids of Shiite villages.
Independent reports said as
many as 150 people were
arrested. There was a series of 15
Israeli operations in southern
Lebanon in the past 16 days fol-
lowing an escalating wave of
Shitte guerrilla attacks on
Israel’s occupation force.

Ethiopia
demands
return of Jews

(UPI) — Ethiopia’s state—run
paper is demanding the return of
thousands of Ethiopian Jews air-
lifted to Israel. The story quotes
government officials who said
the 12,000 Ethiopians are not
really Jewish and were
“abducted."

Cuba eroding

news agency says erosion has
damaged 70 percent of the land
on the Caribbean island. I_t cites
the high salt content, improper
irrigation and bad soil manage-
ment as reasons for the problem.

in. I have had over a dozen meetings
with smaller groups of faculty,”
Cochran said.

Neither Bergman nor Cochran
feel that the talk ofa possible closing
will cause permanent damage to the
school’s reputation. Bergman said,
“I think we are going to have some
PR to do, but it won’t damage us
that much.”

Cochran noted, “I believe this
brief period of confrontation in the
long haul is completely forgotten.“
Should the school be saved, it can-
not protect itself from talk or action
of trying to close it again. Bergman
commented, “I don’t think this will
happen again in the near future, but
no, we can’t make them sign [a docu-
ment guaranteeing the school’s
existence].”

If the school were to close, what
would happen to those presently
enrolled in the program?

“The university is obligated to
give everyone an opportunity to sue-
ceed in terms of time. They would
have to phase the school out,” said
Bergman.

But both men don’t see this hap-
pening. Cochran said: “There were
periods where I was less optimistic,
but I think we have done a goodjob
and come up with a workable pro-
posal. I believe the proposal stands
on the likelihood ofapproval. And it
can be implemented as a School of
Pharmacy plan or part ofa new col-
lege of health sciences."

“There is a high demand for the
professional degree student and
almost I00 percent of our students
have jobs before their program is
completed. Also, we are competitive
with tuition rates,” noted Bergman.

Pharmacy student sees hope  
for maintaining the program

.By Lisa G. Gordon
The Pitt News

A few days ago, Monica
Gertsch‘s “Save Our Pharmacy
School" button fell off her back-
pack, and she hasn’t bothered to
put it back on. She has heard a
rumor that the pharmacy school
won’t be closing; her eyes shone
with relief when she talked about
it.

Gertsch said: “When I heard of
the possible closing, I was
shocked. I couldn't understand it
because they hadn’t come up
with enough reasons. I really
wanted to believe that they
wouldn’t close the school, but
then they told the media and that
really frightened me.

“And my parents couldn't
believe it. They said, ‘With a
name like Pitt, how could they
close it?’ ”

Gertsch and the rest of the

pharmacy students combined
forces as soon as they heard the
news. “Over Christmas,“ she
said, “we wrote letters to our
congressmen and we called the
provost and told him how we felt
about it."

" When Iheard ofthepossible

closing, I was shocked.”
— Monica Gertsch,
Pitt Pharmacy Student

As Gertsch talks about the
school, she always says “we.” A
strong sense of togetherness and
pride among the pharmacy stu-
dents has grown, she said,
because “it has taken us a long
way to get here.”

As she sees it, the school is
presently offering a great educa-
tion. “It is very thorough," she
said. “No matter what field of
[pharmaceutical work] we go
into, we have a good back-

ground. For instance, we not
only learn about drugs used in
the United States but the ones
they use in Africa, too.

“And as for the teachers, I
can't think of anyone that I can't I
go to for help. The teachers here
are really dedicated. This good
education shows when we take
our boards ~ Pitt students do
really well on them. '

“I want the school to continue
so that everyone has the same
chance I did. Not everyone can
afford to attend Duquesne, and
Duquesne can’t take everyone in.
I don’t know how much more
[tuition] a lot of other students
can afford.” According to
Gertsch, Pennsylvania has only
four pharmacy schools.

Gertsch decided to become a
pharmacist after working at a
retail pharmacy for a year. She
said, “I loved it and decided that

was the job for me.”

Cash and Cocaine

Government officials report that Colombian drug smugglers have
sent assassination squads to the United States to kidnap and murder
Drug Enforcement Administration agents.

Only a couple of weeks ago, a DEA agent was kidnapped in Mexico
and has yet to be found. U.S. officials expressed their displeasure to
the Mexican government over the way Mexican police responded, or
rather, did not respond, to the agent’s disappearance. It was suggested
that police were on the payroll of the smugglers.

Considering the billions of dollars that are funneled yearly to Latin
American drug smugglers in return for their illicit wares, this wouldn’t
be surprising. The economies of several South American countries are
dependent on the drug trade, as became apparent recently when it was
revealed that prominent officials in the Bolivian government were not

only on the smugglers’ payroll but were actively involved in the’

production and exporting of cocaine.

The market for drugs in the U.S. is so lucrative that Cuba and
Nicaragua have become active in the drug trade in order to finance
weapons purchasing for revolutionaries, according to a speech given
here recently be Stephen Sloan, an expert on international terrorism.

One government estimate reported that the imbalance of foreign
trade represented by the outflow of dollars from the U.S. to Latin
American drug smugglers was only exceeded by the dollars going to
purchase foreign oil.

Colombian drug smugglers routinely walk away from million-
66ll2’IF Balls set lﬁ south Florida courts. It isjust the price of business,
hardly affecting overall profits.

It is immensely lucrative trade involving billions of dollars, and it
seems that Reagan administration efforts to thwart drug smuggling
into the United States is threatening those profits. Why else would the
smugglers need to send hit squads into this country?

But perhaps the United States can pursue a different direction in

combatting the growing power and influence of Colombian drug ‘

smugglers.

DEA officials admit that even though confiscation of illegal drugs is
up (at increased rates), they are intercepting only a small percentage of
the drugs shipped into the country, most of the drugs confiscated
being marijuana and cocaine. .

It is obvious that there is a huge demand for these substances in the
U.S., and nothing short of all—out war is going to put an end to it. Why
not legalize marijuana and cocaine and tax this huge market? The
current prices for these commodities is inflated because oftheir illegal-
ity, so the U.S. could undercut the prices now demanded for these
products and still realize an incredible tax bonanza. The criminals
would soon be out of business and the government would have a rich
source of revenue that, considering current estimates of the billions
involved in the drug trade, could in a matter of years eliminate the
national debt.

Now, of course, this is not the answer to the problem; but it is meant
to illustrate the enormity of a problem which is largely ignored by the
general public. The amount of money involved in drug trafficking is
enormous. When large amounts of money are involved, corruption is
inevitable.

The solution to the drug problem is not in intercepting shipments of
drugs into the country, but in eliminating the apparent need by
millions of Americans to consume them.

Perhaps if drug consumers knew that their money is helping to
empower gangsters politically, they would voluntarily quit using
them.

Correction

Thanks for the front page article
by Byran Lee on the Thomas Mer-
ton Center’s evening of poetry read-
ing with Fr. Daniel Berrigan Friday,
Feb. 1 (Pitt News, Feb. 4, 1985).

There are a few technical, but
important, clarifications I would
like to make. First, Fr. Berrigan is an
ordained priest and a member in
good standing of the Society of
Jesus, the Jesuits. He is not
“defrocked.” His brother Phillip,
also a member of the Plowshares
Eight, was formerly a priest and a
member of the Josephite communi-
ty. He left the priesthood and that
community and is married to Eliza-
beth McAlister, to whom several of
the poems which Daniel read were
dedicated. Second, Fr. Ernesto Car-
denal is a member of the Cistercian
community and was a student of
Thomas Merton. He is presently the
minister of culture in Nicaragua. It is
his brother, Fernando, who was dis-
missed from the Jesuits because he
would not resign his post in the
Nicaraguan government. Fernando
is the Nicaraguan minister of
education.

Abort, Mr. Spock

Although a bit tardy, this is in
response to Tim Hunter‘s anti-
abortion article (Jan. 21). Let me
first make clear that I am in full
agreement with Mr. Hunter’s unas-
sailably correct position. In a star-

. tling display of logic which would

make Mr. Spock turn pink with

envy, he established that the fertil-»
ized egg of a human is a person

because it has the potential to be a

person. Along the same lines, I have

the potential to be a bleeding-heart

liberal, therefore I am.

Hmmm. Tim‘s logic may only
merit a raised eyebrow from Spock,
but for fear of being labeled a malar-
key spewer, I'll agree with his fact-
free premise. What bothers me is
Hunter's callous disregard for the
potential human beings called the
egg and the sperm. Although they
each lack a full complement of

, chro'mosomes,_they1hav_e, the poten-_.

tial to be a fertilized egg. By Hunter's

reasoning, then, a sperm and an egg
are human beings which deserve full
protection under the law.

The facts presented above have
some hefty legal ramifications. First,

' male masturbation will become a

capital offense. Each ejaculation
senselessly slaughters millions of
human beings. The heinous mass-
murdering masturbator kills many
more people than the 15 million who
have been aborted since the legaliza-
tion of abortion in 1973.

Second, couples who try to con-
ceive and don't, and also women
who ovulate without conceiving,
will be guilty of involuntary man-
slaughter. Couples who have sex for
pleasure with no intention to con-
ceive will be charged with criminal
negligence.

Finally, contraceptive devices will
have to be designated as deadly
weapons. In order to assure that
these devices won’t be banned
forever, the National Rifle Associa-
tion will have to lobby in Washing-
ton for our God-given right to bear
deadly weapons (condoms don't kill,
people do).

These thoughts for the future are
at present incomplete. I’m sure if
Tim and I put our heads together, we
could come up with more new laws
and possible ways to enforce them.

Objection

Well, I picked up The Pitt News
today, and like a good cornmunica—
tions major, flipped straight to the
editorial page and read the letters to
the editor. Now, after reading the
letter entitled “More High Tech," I
did notjust feel it my duty to answer
this absurd column, I felt compelled
to do so by some great outer force.
Therefore, listen closely, Mr. Wil-
liam Taylor, ifyou are listening, for I
have a few things to say to you. First
of all, we should definitely stand
behind Pitt as much as possible;
however, if you understood how the
U.S. college system works, then you
would know that Pitt can never be
pushed into the same league as Har-
vard, Yale or Stanford, since they
are Ivy League schools. You dis-
counted some arguments that the
opponents of the Five-year Plan
presented, so it is onlyjust that I now
discount some of yours.

0 Regarding the rhetoric/com-
munications department: I am
neither a jock nor unintelligent; if
you would like to see my QPA, just

-ask,-‘And, J. <19 »_n,o.t-.f.e¢l t.hat.my.co.I-

lege” career is being used‘ as a hiding

place just because I chose the
demanding major of communica-
tions in which to achieve and excel.
True, this space, after the dissolu-
tion of the department, could be
made into a computer center, but the
money regained would not come
close to the amount necessary for a
decent computer center. So until
you manage to come up with some
major bucks to back up your idea, I
would rethink your situation a bit.

0 The whole reason the U.S. is the
best place in the world to live is that
as citizens, we have the freedom to
choose our vocation. If you have
objections to artists in general, then
I advise you to: a) not become one
yourself and b) not look at those
sculptures or paintings to which you
so obviously take objection. Plus,
once again, you have this strange
conception that space is all we need
for a grand computer center. This
sounds like something a spy from
IBM might say, not the average Pitt
student. Your theories are very
interesting, but they are better stated
by Isaac Asimov or Poul Anderson.

0 As for the School of Education,
well, since you so nicely quoted the
business maxim, “If it ain’t produc-
ing, cut your losses and run,” it is
obvious that the education school —
or rather the whole system —- failed
with you. I was taught that “isn’t” is
the correct word to use and “ain’t” is
only a figment of the illiterate

jmagination.

0 The only thing I have to say to
you regarding GSPIA is that if you
are so scared about being taken over
by foreigners, then you are late by 30
years. Wake up! The Red Scare is
over! I, too, am a native Pitts-
burgher, yet because I am secure in

my own identity, I have no such"

absurd beliefs or thoughts.
0 The pharmacy school graduates

pharmacists who dispense drugs to

those people who really need them
for heart ailments, cancer and other
illnesses, ones that may even be life-
threatening. Also, if you would
check on your facts, smuggling and
private enterprise are the two major
forces behind the drug problem in
the country and not pharmacists.
Then, I am really glad these are
the only comments and views you
had to express. Concerning the last

remark over the Pitt Schenley Cafe:

By being so concerned because oth-
ers are there meeting and studying
but not eating, this statement would
be believable from someone who
does not have many friends, and I
feel sorry for anyone who has never
had time just to meet friends and
take advantage of the pleasure of
friends‘ company.

Finally, as a staunch backer of
President Reagan and most of his
policies, I take great offense at your
interpretation of his beliefs. Reagan

Influence

We have heard that the adminis-
tration at the University of Pitts-
burgh may be against the
outspokenness of The Pitt News.

Let me state that although The
Pitt News may not rank in circula-
tion with The Wall Street Journal or
even The Pittsburgh Press it does
equal those publications in quality
of content.

Just because someone sitting in a
nice office at the top ofthe cathedral
doesn’t like some of the paper's arti-
cles is no reason to condemn or chas-
tise the efforts of those striving to
produce the best student newspaper
they can. In fact, the only ones
entitled to criticize The Pitt News
are the people it serves — the

' . students.

Having been abroad, I have seen
that it is the students who influence
designs in social and governmental
matters. Remembering how active
we were when I was in school, I
wonder why those at Pitt now
appear so lackadaisical.

Mr. Posvar, remember when we
had ROTC thrown out of Pitt? This
country needs a change. The people
who will change it are those growing
up now.

Pitt is a very good school. That is
why I have contributed to the uni-
versity financially and actively
through the Alumni Affairs office
since the day of my graduation.

Those attending school must be
able to think. They must know how
to weigh opinions and decide the
answers for themselves. Just because
someone writes something contro-
versial does not necessarily mean
they believe it.

To stimulate ideas and discussion
results in a better solution. Don’t
force the students to be puppets
whose major activity is taking notes.
Allow those on whose shoulders the
destiny of the nation depends to be
able to express themselves and learn
how to decipher the information
they receive and make conclusive
decisions about what they believe.

From Under My Desk/ Dan Bates

    

As a typical college student, I have
made vending machines an integral

' part of my life. Between classes, I

often depend on these automated
beasts for my very survival.

Oh, and I do mean beasts. You
see, I firmly believe that vending
machines have minds of their own.
I’m also convinced they are out to
get us.

For instance, why do I always
seem to find those fruit pies at the
top rack of vending machines? The
other day, my stomach screamed for
a peach pie. Without thinking, I put
some change into the slot and hit the
correct button. I failed to notice the
vast distance between the pie and the
bottom of the machine. Splat! So
much for my peach pic.

I realize vending machines are the
result of human technology, but
they seem to function properly only
when they feel the urge. I wonder if
these machines get pleasure out of
aggravating students‘? You know,
it’s possible.

Vending machines really try my

The mean machines of everyday life

patience. Once, I skipped breakfast,
and I wanted to buy a cinnamon roll
from a machine. I put the money in
and pushed the button. To my dis-
gust, the machine held that roll fast.
I put more money into the machine
and lost again. The thing was a thief.
When I tried once more, the
machine gave in and dropped me
three large cinnamon rolls. And I
wasn’t that hungry.

One machine snagged a bag of
potato chips Ijust purchased as it
was ready to drop from the rack. As
the bag dangled there, I growled and
began rocking the machine back and
forth violently, determined to get my
potato chips. My fit of anger caught
the attention ofa security guard who
promptly scolded me. I never did
retrieve those chips.

Coffee and hot chocolate
machines get a kick out of dropping
the cup upside down before pouring
the drink. I have even had the oppor-
tunity of watching a machine drop
the liquid before the cup. What do
these machines have against me?

And did you know that vending
machines are very particular about
money? Some machines accept only
certain widths in coins. That‘s right.
Dimes vary in width, and the
machines frown on that. As far as
I'm concerned, a dime is a dime.

Those change machines can never
seem to decide when to accept or
reject dollar bills. Standing in line
once to get change, I saw many peo-
ple putting in crumpled dollars that
probably went through the wash.
The machine accepted the money; I
was glad."I stepped up to it with my
brand—new bill but got to watch the
machine rudely spit it out. Ijust
wasn't going to get change that day.

To add to the troubles of vending
machines, now some of them talk.
While shopping at an area super-
market recently, I became unbeara-
bly thirsty, so I approached a
seemingly harmless Coke machine.
As I inconspicuously put in my
change, the machine talked to me. In
a sweet female voice, it said: “Hi, I’m
a talking vending machine for Coca-

Cola. Make your selection, please.”

Now that I had the attention of
every shopper in the store, I made
my selection.

“Thank you for using the talking
vendor,” the machine continued.
“Come again."

“Fat chance!" I yelled.

Someone told me of a guy who

was so embarrassed by one of those
communicating machines that he
left his soft drink there and walked
away. I guess I wasjust too thirsty to
react in that way.
. I was intrigued by the female
voice, though. Do you think, maybe,
when a girl approaches the machine,
it would answer in a deep, masculine
voice? I wonder.

I'm really getting tired of vending

‘machines, and I’m truly sick of

becoming a foolish spectacle every
time I want a lousy snack. One of
these days, a vending machine is
going to push mejust a little too far.
When it does, though, I will take a
step back, smile and merely pull out
the plug.

Poll, please

This letter is in response to the
editor’s note of Feb. 8 declaring
“The University’s Mission” poll
between President Posvar and
Chancellor Litchfield invalid.

You reported that therewas a
“fundamental error.” You are cor-
rect in one sense. President Posvar’s
mission for the university is in error
in the idea of education. The pur-
pose of a university is learning and
not that of making a profit. Our uni-
versity’s mission seems to be the lat-
ter, considering the proposed
Five-year Plan and the attempted
dissolution of the pharmacy school,
just to begin the list of suspicious
plans of the administration. Presi-
dent Posvar’s proposed mission
reflects the nature of these university
plans and is therefore an accurate
representation. Considering this, I
know of many students who must
have been titillated by the opportun-
ity to voice their opinions through
the poll. It is unfortunate that it was

' declared invalid.

From Where

I .Stand/ Kelly Caruso

A commuter

Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary
explains the term “commute” as to
travel back and forth regularly. The
definition only scratches the surface

. of the true meaning of “commute.”I

would therefore like to offer several
definitions of my own:

EIEIEIEICIEI

commute —— to.know 65 ways to stop
a passing PAT bus, but not to have
any idea where the best parties are.

DEICIEICICI

commute —— to wear galoshes and
carry an umbrella; to wear hiking
boots, gloves and a scarf during the
entire school year.

ElEll:lEll:l|___l

commute — to have at least three
outdated bus schedules or at least
two parking tickets that haven't
been paid.

ADDDDDD

1S 

commute — to have a bookpack
filled with quarters, bus tickets,
packages of bubblegum, every text-
book for every class, and the ever-
faithful Walkman.

People do not sympathize with me
when I tell them that my entire ward-
robe consists of dark-colored outfits
—— every light piece of clothing that I
owned had been excessively spotted
with mud and slush from passing
PAT buses. Nor do I get a shoulder
to cry on when I tell people that
studying in my house is about as
easy as trying to cross the Atlantic
on a skateboard. I really do not want
pity from my friends, but a little

understanding would be appre-
ciated.

It would be terrific if I could live
on campus next year. However, the
big problem is trying to convince
Mom and Dad that the $1,500 (or
whatever it is) would be worth it.

I have tried every possible
approach to try and persuade my
parents that living in the dorms
instead of at home with the family
would be to my benefit and theirs.

My first attempt was the “everyone
is living in the dorms these days”
routine; they didn't buy that at all.
Second was the “living in the dorms
will help me become my own person,
and I'll meet more people" routine;
they responded, “Who are you now

if you‘re not your own person?"and —

“You don’t need any more friends.”
My sister, is already looking for-
ward to me moving out, and she has
made major renovation plans for
our bedroom: a life-sized photo-
graph of Dee.Snider (in full cos-
tume) next to the mirror, an “I Love
Ozzy Osbourne” lamp on the desk
and a matching stapler, and mirrors
on the stereo system. To top it all off,
she is already putting ads in the
newspaper for my presently occu-
pied space. I guess the next move
will be my sister’s having my suit-
cases packed when I get home.

So until Iget upthe courage to tell
my parents that I want to live on
campus one of these days, the buses
will have to do. The crowding, the
constant lateness, the unreasonable
fares and just the all-around hassle
of commuting by bus is better than
walking -— or is it?

to meet college costs," stated
Cukanna. .

In the 1986 budget, the federal
administration proposed several
ways to reduce student aid. The
major proposal is the elimination of
subsidized loans to students whose
gross family income exceeds $32,500
a year. -

Another proposed cut that would
particularly affect middle—income
families would place a $4,000 a year
limit on the amount of money an
undergraduate or graduate student
may receive from federal grants,
loans and subsidizedjobs combined.

“This would particularly hinder
graduate students because their
financial costs far exceed the $4,000
cap,” explained Cukanna.

Another proposed measure would
require students to provide $800 a
year to their education if they wish

I O-ThE.PittI News, Monday, February 25, I985

Cuts will be costly

to qualify for federal assistance.
Also proposed were stiffer regula-
tions of loan defaults and tougher
monitoring of students who claim to
be independent.

“Students should keep in mind
that not all of these proposals are
going to be enacted. But they should
expect some stiffening of criteria,"
Altomari stated. '

At Pitt, approximately 67 percent
of all the full-time undergraduates
are receiving some sort of ﬁnancial
assistance from the federal or state
governments. ‘

In order to keep up with changes
in trying to finance an education,
Altomari advises two things.

“First, be politically active. Your
representatives in Washington are
voting on your future right now. Let
them know what you think.
Secondly, apply even if you don’t
expect to receive the aid, and most
importantly, always apply on time."

The Pitt News, iylonday,   1985

Men gymnasts defeat Slippery Rock  

cominued from page sixteen
“It’s almost like sticking a knife in

your heart when you witness some- ‘

thing like this,” commented head
coach Frank D’Amico. “It’s a very
cold situation right now  He prob-
ably won’t be back." .

Miller’s condition will be deter-
mined on Friday when he undergoes
more observation. He said that if the
results show ligament damage, he
will undergo surgery as soon as pos-
sible. If not, he will take on arehabil-

itation program. “I always knew Pd 9

go out with a bang,” Miller stated.

“It’s too bad it had to happenthis I

way.”

Despite Miller’s loss, the Panthers
proved to be too much for the
Rockets, with overall talent and
team strength as the deciding fac-
tors. Although the 263 score doesn't
indicate it, this proved to be one of
Pitt’s most successful meets of the
season.

Besides Miller’s injury, the big
news of the meet had to be the per-
formance of junior All-East Mark
Klafter. In compiling an overall
score of 56.5 Klafter had his best
meet of the season. Klafter also
smashed two school records in the
process.

His first success was on the floor
exercise, where he broke his old
record of 9.75 with an admirable 9.8.
The parallel bars were his next tri-
umph as he bettered fellow team-

mate Matt Peter’s school record of
9.5 by putting out a 9.65 score.

“My concentration was at a
peak,” Klafter said after the meet. “I
used my usual ﬂoor routine, but I
stepped up the difficulty a little bit.”
Klafter compiled additional scores
of 9.2 (pommel horse), and 9.6 (high
bar), both personal bests.

Fellow All-East counterpart Matt
Peters pulled in a 55.1 overall score,
including a pair of 9.85 on the high

“bar _— the second straight week he
has attained this.

“He swings as smooth as glass,”
Klafter commented on Peters’ high
bar efforts.

As usual, Pitt received a strong
overall team effort. Some individual
included freshman Jorge
Sanchez on floor and junior Jeff
Shablin on the pommel horse.

“I’m pretty happy with my perfor-
mance,” Shablin said. “I’ve been sick
recently and was havingidifficulty in
my breathing, but luckily my
improvement hasn‘t really suffered."

The Panthers had a strong effort
on rings, scoring over 44, but still
had difficulty in vaulting and pom-
mel horse — two events D’Amico
termed the “sore eyes” ofthis season.

“I'm very optimistic about next
year," explained D’Amico. “We‘re
going to be spending a lot of time on
these two events in our spring practi-
ces, and with a good recruiting year,
they [the events] should regain their

strength.”

Pitt was aiming at its first score of
270 on Thursday, but Miller’s fall
prohibited this. “We need a healthy

team in order for us to really com- _

pete to our ability,” explained Klaf-
ter. “We just don't have the depth
and manpower to cover up for a set-
back like Ed’s." '

Nonetheless, Miller did go out in
style, scoring a 9.3 on rings before
the injury, the second highest ring
score of the year. “His routine on
rings was simply fantastic," com-
mented Klafter. “There's no doubt
that he's a team leader He'll
always be there to help us.”

The Panthers will be preparing
this week for Saturday’s home meet
against the No. l Buckeyes of Ohio
State. The Buckeyes recently upset
the then No. 1 Penn State. “It’s
going to be tough,” D’Amico
explained. “We’re really not expect-
ing a win because an upset in college
gymnastics is highly unlikely. Their
team depth will probably prove to be
too much for us to handle.”

One positive sign will be the
return of sophomore Kevin Garren.
Garren has been out for two weeks
with a shoulder injury and should
help pick up the pieces caused by the
absence of Ed Miller. “We have
really had a tough year in terms of
injuries,’-’ reinforced Klafter. “It sure
would be nice if we had both Garren
and Miller.”

The Pitt News, Monday, February 25, 1985

Miklasevich shows the way

Pitt upsets BC

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

Pitt coach Roy Chipman is hop-
ing the latest bug to hit his squad will
not be cured for awhile. It is a
strange virus, including symptoms
like aggressiveness, intimidation
and spending a lot of time on the
floor. It is called the “Miklasevich
Syndrome." ’

Deservingly named after Pitt for-
ward Matt Miklasevich, the illness is
a characteristic of a hungry basket-
ball team, which is how Pitt played
Saturday night when they defeated
Boston College 58-55.

The first statement Chipman
made in his post-game interview
was, ‘‘I guess this was a win for the
blue-collar worker.” Yes, indeed,
and if Pitt has a blue-collar player, it
is definitely Miklasevich.

The junior from Franklin
Regional High School makes up for
lack of size (He’s only 6-7.) with hus-
tle. Chipman is the first to agree.
“[Matt] puts his body on line every
time he’s out there,” Chipman said.

Chipman even offered an expla-
nation for the sudden epidemic of
the Miklasevich syndrome, citing
Matt’s ability to lead by example
with his agressive play. “That stuffis
catchy," said Chipman. “The other
guys see it, and they start doing it.”

Earlier in the week against
Georgetown, the Panthers looked as
if they had been getting booster
shots against the Miklasevich Syn-
drome, but Saturday night was a dif-
ferent story. “This was one of the

most important wins for us,” said
Miklasevich. “It gave us some pride
and dignity.”

There was, perhaps, a question
concerning pride and dignity follow-
ing the consecutive blowout losses to
St. John’s and Georgetown, but all
questions were answered Saturday
night.

Chipman shuffled his lineup and
came out smelling like a rose. After
substituting freely throughout the
first half, Chipman stuck with Mik-
lasevich, Curtis Aiken, Darryl Shep-
herd, Demetreus Gore and Charles
Smith for most ofthe second half. It
was with this lineup that the syn-
drome became prominent. From
Aiken’s f1rst—halfdive for a loose ball
in front of B.C. guard Michael
Adams to Gore’s retrieval ofa loose
ball in the waning seconds of the
game while on his knees, one had
visions of Miklasevich. Twice Mik-
lasevich and Shepherd both wound
up on the ground after scrambles for
loose balls, and Smith took his share
of lumps, too.

For Miklasevich, the syndrome
was something he was born with. “I
play that way all the time,” said Mik-
lasevich. “You just have to work
your butt off.”

Aiken added, “He fitted in real
well; he hustles.”

So for now, Chipman will keep his
players hungry. The battle for the
starting lineup will keep Pitt at a
competitive level of intensity, of
which Chipman said, “To play in the
Big East, you must play with tre-
mendous intensity.”

Matt Miklasevich has plenty of
that.

Hockey club finishes year with 6-4 win

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Hockey Club
ended its regular season play on a
victorious note last Wednesday by
slipping past Bethany 6-4 on the
Bisons’ home ice in Wheeling.

The Panthers have a tendency to
come out skating ﬂat on road games,
and they showed no exception on
Wednesday as Bethany made the
Pitt skaters struggle to remain in
control of the game. “We went into
the game thinking we were going to
kill them,” confessed defenseman
John Pettit, “but they were really
surprising — especially the way they
broke out of their own end.”

The first period ended with the
score tied at one, but in the second
period the Panthers broke loose by
scoring two more goals, giving
themselves a one-point lead by the
end of that period. Bethany
remained within threatening dis-
tance for the entire game. “We

played very bad,” stated defenseman
Bill Kieinski. “Wejust came olfa big
game with Gannon, and we thought
nobody could beat us. It was slow in
the first period. lt was Damon
[Brown] who finally got things mov-
ing in the second period, and then
the pace began to pick up once eve-
ryone followed his lead.”

The Panthers realize that to defeat
the tougher teams in the playoffs,
they will need greater concentration
and intensity than they demon-
strated against Bethany. The Pitt
skaters were scheduled to play
Bethany again yesterday, but the
Bisons forfeited, leaving the Pan-
thers with a win and a final season
record of 17-2-1. The Panthers’ first
playoff game is set for Sunday after-
noon against CMU, and although
Pitt already defeated the Tartans
twice this season, there are several
recent events that are shaking the
Panthers’ confidence.

Yesterday in a pick-up game with
the Junior Pens which the Panthers
lost 4-3, two Pitt skaters were
injured and will not play Sunday.
Left wing Jim Owens Jr. tore the
cartilage in his knee while another

winger, Pete Barbara, suffered a
shoulder injury. Center Jeff Bele
feels that the Panthers will be able to

_ compensate for the loss of these two

players although the line changes
may have an impact on the teams
playing style. “Jim and Pete are both
my linemates, and I’m used to play-
ing with those guys. I won’t be used
to anybody else,” said Bele, “but we
have a fine team so we’ll be OK.”

If the Panthers beat CMU on
Sunday, they will be faced with even
tougher competition in cross-town
rival Duquesne (19-1) but the Pan-
thers know that it is dangerous to
look too far ahead. CMU caine very
close to upsetting the Panthers’ in
their last encounter, and the Pitt
skaters have learned to secure one
game at a time.

“It’s easy to beat a team once, and
it’s harder to beat them the second
time,” said Pitt co-captain Jim Lang
about CMU. “But it’s real hard to
beat a team three times in a season,
especially when they're a good team
and well-coached. Duquesne is two
games away. Right now everybody
has to worry about CMU. or we
might never make it that far."

Bruce powers
Panthers, 62-59

continuedfrom page sixteen
in a tie for eighth place in the Big
East, and since the Panthers won an
earlier game on Jan. 23 at the field
house by a score of 89-59, this game
was supposed to be another
blowout. '

The first half was highlighted by a
score of turnovers and personal
fouls as Pitt played as though they
were glued to the floor with their
minds in never-never land.

With 4:45 to go in the half, Diane
Poletti hit a driving layup to give the
Huskies a 30-18 lead. Suddenly, it
was Connecticut that threatened to
make the game a blowout.

Jennifer Bruce provided the only
offense for Pitt, finishing the half
with I5 points and six rebounds.
Bruce and center Jenny Tyner both
picked up three personal fouls each
and the Lady Panther‘s hopes
looked dim as Huskie Forwards
Leigh Curl and Peggy Walsh were
doing damage inside. The two com-
bined for 16 points and six
rebounds.

The teams traded baskets in the
final four minutes of the half to
make the score 34-22 in favor of the
underdog Huskies. Pitt headed into
the locker room, seemingly in for a
verbal downdressing by head coach

Judy Saurer.

For the second game in a row,
there were two women officials
assigned to the game. And for the
second game in a row, the Panther
coaches were extremely unsatisfied
with the results. Coach Saurer con-
fronted officials Marge Dolan and
Sandy Orapel and gave them about
five minutes’ worth of her feelings
before going into the locker room.

“I thought the officiating was out-
rageous," said Saurer. “Women offi-
cials, I’m telling you, I just don’t
know it I have a lot or time Iortnem.
I’m just disappointed tremendously.
It looked like they werejust trying to
foul Jennifer Bruce out andjust wer-
en't calling it both ways in the first
half.”

“It seemed that way,” agreed
Bruce. “I thought it was terrible."

As has been the case all season,
the Lady Panthers got back into the
game_ on the strength of their
defense. Pitt scrapped their man-to-
man defense and came out in their
I-2-l—l full court press and 2-3 zone.
“We've definitely had to press and
we had to contain Curl and Walsh
inside,” said Saurer.

With 15:45 to go in the game,
Ellen Gilhooley hit a three-point
play and Jennifer made a foul shot
to pull Pitt to within three points at
36-33. The teams traded baskets for
the next five minutes until the 10:59
mark when the Lady Panthers put
on a tremendous ﬂurry of points to
take their first lead of the game.

Fubio started by hitting a long
jumper, just beating the shot clock.
Kim Tirik then stole a pass and fed
Bruce for a short jumper and Bruce
followed that with a turnaround
jumper in the lane to give Pitt a 48-
44 lead with 9:38 to go.

After having the lead for most of
the game, it appeared that Connecti-
cut would not fold and let the Pan-
thers have their blowout. But the
HB§lElE§ Htiag tsugn, aria me ieaa
changed hands ll times in the next
eight minutes.

During that time, Jennifer Bruce
picked up her fifth personal foul,
forcing Pitt to look for Ellen Gilhoo-
ley inside. Gilhooley responded with
two clutch baskets in the final
minutes.

With 52 seconds remaining, Con-
necticut had the ball and the lead at
59-58. But the Panther defense
forced them to call a time—out with
only four seconds left on the shot

File phu.=.:»/ The Pitt News

A last-minute shot by Stephanie Collins (30) put Pitt up and over Connec-
ticut on Saturday at Fitzgerald Field House.

clock. Jill Brumbaugh forced a long
jumper that was way off, and Pitt
got the rebound. Pitt took the ball
across the time line and called a
time-out with 17 seconds remaining.

The Lady Panthers would try
again to set up a shot for senior
guard Stephanie Collins. “She’s our
designated shooter,” said Saurer.
“She’s a great shooter and I have a
lot of confidence in her, and she’s got
a lot of confidence in her shot. There
is no question that I want her to take
it." ’

When play resumed, Collings
rolled off a screen and slipped deep
into right corner. She got a pass and
hit the long-rangejumper with seven
seconds remaining, giving Pitt a 60-
59 lead. “I’m a shooter and I really

haven’t had the season that I would
like to have had,” said Collins. “But
when it comes down to the final
seconds, I feel as if I can make the
shot.”

Gilhooley then iced the Pitt vic-
tory by stealing an attempted long
pass by the Huskies and converting
two foul shots. The Lady Panthers
were again led by Bruce, who fin-
ished with 31 points and 10
rebounds. Gilhooley and Fubio pro-
vided assistance with 10 points each.
Connecticut got I7 points from
Peggy Walsh and 16 from Curl and
I0 from Anne Fiolkowski.

Pitt must now begin to prepare for
the Big East Championship Tourna-
ment which is being held on Febru-
ary 28 through March 3 at Manley

Field House on the campus of Syra-
cuse University. The Lady Panthers
could finish in fourth place and draw
Syracuse in the opening round. Each
team beat the other on its home
court during the regular season.

“I would prefer not to open
against Syracuse, but I don’t mind
playing anybody,” commented
Saurer. “I think we’ve taken our
lumps this season. We’ve won 16
games but I know that we are better
than our ll losses. The kids feel the
same way that I feel and I know that
we’re going to go up there and play
as hard as we can play.”

“I feel real comfortable going into
the tournament,” said Collins, “I
think we have a good team and can
win it.”

Panthers down Boston C

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

As he has in beautifully articulate
terms this season, Charles Smith
craned his way to spectacular pro-
portions. Under less than ideal con-
ditions, the 6-IO forward piloted a
nose-diving Panther basketball
squad to ajarring victory over Bos-
ton College Saturday night 58-55.

The freshman played his most bal-
anced two halves this season while
Coach Roy Chipman inserted four
entirely new starters alongside him.

Smith was blind to that as 23
points and 14 rebounds dazzled a
sellout (6.670) crowd at Fitzgerald

Field House. Chipman had little
choice but to scramble up a new
lineup after the Panthers (l9-9, 7-7)
were consecutively blindsided by St.
John’s and Georgetown.

“It all came down to practice,”
Smith said of the determinant.
“Who hustled the most, who really
wanted it.”

After three days of gut—spilling in
Closed sessions, the Panthers didn’t
seal this latest victory until Smith
popped in a turnaroundjumper with
18 seconds remaining, making it 56-
55.

By dropping the Eagles (I8-8, 7-8)
for the second time in ’85, Pitt has
amassed its most Big East wins ever,
good enough for a chance at a sole
standing in fifth place.

En route, the most novel changes
turned out to be Chipman’s second-
guard duo of Joey David and Junie
Lewis in the backcourt. At center,
Andre Williams spelled Keith Arm-
strong while‘ Darryl Shepherd
picked up his first start ever at power
forward.

The catalyst, though, was Smith,
now one point shy of breaking Sam
Clancy’s 378-point freshman record.

“Charley Smith was awesome,
and he wasn’t to be denied,” Chip-
man said later. “I thought that ifyou
look at films of the first game [61-55
comeback win], they have no one
inside to stop him. We kept ham-
mering away at him and he pro-

Gymnasts
win with
hurt captain

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

The men's gymnastics team trav-
eled to Slippery Rock University last
Thursday night and defeated the
Rockets by an impressive 263-222
score. However, the Panthers again
fell victim to injury, this time with
harsh results.

Lone senior and team captain Ed
Miller suffered what may be two
torn ligaments in his left knee during
a landing on the parallel bars in
Thursday’s meet.

phrase.

Syndrome

The rough-and-tumble play of Matt Miklase-
vich has inspired the formation of a new

duced for us.”

“I wanted to take control toward
the end," Smith said. “Like I said at
the start of the season, when it mat-
ters, I want to be there."

The Panthers didn't gain their
first lead of the second half until
Shepherd (10 points, six boards)
assisted on another Smith turna-
round at 7:28. The two then pro-
ceeded to knock in all but two ofthe
Panthers’ remaining points.

“I planned on playing good
defense,” said Shepherd, whose 35
minutes were second to Smith’s 40.
“I got really tired fast. In the second
half I felt like I caught a second
wind. I was trying to look IHSILH; to
Charles. He’s so much bigger than
everyone else, easy to spot.”

While Smith again sparkled
against B.C. (26 on Jan. 2l), Eagles’
point guard Michael Adams never
did get unwound, scoring eight
points, exactly half his average. The
only double-figure scorer for B.C.
was Dom Pressley (12).

The Eagles shot a horrendous 26
percent in the second half, finishing
with 35.3 from the field to Pitt’s 46
percent overall.

“[Adams] had only one shot in the
1-3-1, we knew it would take him out
of his game,” David said.

With four new starters, nothing
was certain until Chipman tested the
reserve talent. The vagueness con-
tinues even now as Chipman pon-
ders his starting four for tomorrow
night’s venture into Syracuse’s Car-
rier Dome.

Only a kidnapping would leave
Smith off the starting ballot.

“I don’t know how permanent this
will be,” Chipman said. “Certainly
we have to shoot the ball better,
especially from the free throw line
[50 percent]. This effort tonight will
not win the Syracuse game for us.”

As for the players, no one is
committed.

“The coach is a type of coach that
believes in five who work hard,”
Shepherd said. “He doesn’t care if
we win or lose. From his standpoint,
it’s been a good move so far.”

“The important thing is we played
hard,” David said. “Whenthe guys
starting in there play hard, then
there’s a carryover.”
