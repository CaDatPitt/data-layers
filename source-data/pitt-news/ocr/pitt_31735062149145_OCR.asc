Faculty to Eniorce
'No Holiday’ Ruling

Faculty members have been in-
structed not to dismiss any classe.
Mor.d‘y, it was learned yesterday

In an anncuttccment to The Pit‘.
News, John Downie, BA39, presi-
den: of SFA, made public the
opinion expressed by the Assembly
in regard to Monday holidays fol-
lowing major football v'ctories.
Downie’s statement is as follows:

“Now that a large portion of
the student body is concentrated
in the Cathedral of Learning,
schools and departments other
than the undergraduate schools
are involved. It is our feeling
that the place'to show our en-
thus'asm and support of the team
is at the pep rallies preceding
the games, and on the fotball
ﬁeld during the game.

“The so-called unauthorized
football holidays which have
taken place in the past, are not
in keeping with the maturity and
dignity of the Un'versity, for
they represent a misguided en-
thusiasm which is not represen-
tative of the vast majority of the
student body. We, therefore, ask
the students of the University to
cooperate with us to eliminate
such accompanying noise and un-
digniﬁed conduct.”

History Article

Dr. N. A. N. Cleven. professor of
history, has an article, “Henry
Marie Brackenridge, Diplomat,” in

Pitt, Rams Resume
‘Pointless’ Rivalry

Tomorrow the unbeaten Pitt’.~‘r

Panthers will tr" to " ‘
defeated, but once tied Fordham
Rams before a re--.,-

75,000, who will jam the De Sota ,

street“ bowl tighter than even a

sardine can when the 2 o’clock‘

kick-oﬁ’ sets in motion the stand-

out football contest of the dav.
The game has caught the fancy

of the football world, and foot

ball talk has replaced news of the 5

day around town. Even the usually
placid Pitt student body will be
out in pep meeting this morning
warming the vocal cords for to-
morrow’s festivities.

The Stadium has been sold out
for two weeks and ducats for the
game are scarcer than snow shoes
in the Sahara. The mail order
basis of all sales makes the sell-
out unique.

For the last three years the boys
from Rose Hill have played hos‘
to the Panthers and for threr
years it’s been “much ado abou‘;
nothing”. This year both team
have great oifensive backs and the
goose-egg series may terminate n

,a high scoring game that will makc

up for the scoring dearth in Pitt
Fordham football relations.

ESHMONT BIG THREAT
For the last decade the Ram and
the Panther have been perennial
leaders in the East. Since 1928 Pitt
has bowed but once to an Eastern
"eleven, _ Duquesne having P79‘

"vailed in ‘"1936, M. Fordham has

bowed thrice to Eastern opposi-
tion since 1928. Fordham has been
unbeaten since the ﬁnal game of
the 1936 season when New York
University spilled the beans, 7-6,
in an upset.

The House of Wojciechowicz
brings along two sets of brilliant
backs who operate behind a de-
fensive line that compares with
Fordham’s Seven Blocks of Gran-
ite of 1937. Sophomore Leonard
Eshmont will be Crowley’s chief
stick of dynamite. The shifty Rose
Hill sophomore is such a dynamic
runner that it is conceivable that
he may break away once or twice,
even against so formidable a bar-
rier as the Panthers.

Eshmont may not be in the
opening line-up but will enter the
game the earliest moment that
Crowley thinks he can do some
good. Michael Hearn, an excellent
defensive back, and Steve Kazlo,
another climax runner, will be in
the halfback saddles for Ford-
ham. Dom Principe, hailed as one
of the best fullbacks in the coun-
try, will block, kick, and carry the
ball from that position. Bill Kry-
wicki will call the signal and do
the brain work. Pe;e Holovak,
Stan Lewczyk, and Angelo Fortu-
nato complete the Fordham relief
backﬁeld brigade.

JACUN SKI BACK

The Fordham forward wall will
be ﬂanked by Co-Captain Harry
Jacunski, end candidate for All-
American honors, and Vincent
Dennery. John Kuzman and Ray
Riddick, tackles; Co-Captain Mike
Kochel and Jimmy Hayes, guards;

Lou De-Fillipo, center. The Ram V

front trenches carry on the “they
shall not pass” tradition of their
predecessors. Pitt’s crack back-
ﬁeld will have to turn on all the
pressure to make headway against
this line.

Unless tackle Walt Raskowski
rounds into shape, Coach Jock
Sutherland will make the ﬁrst
break in the Panther line-up since
the opening of the season. Bill
Daddio and Fabian Hoffman, ends;
Elmer Merkovsky and Walt Ras-
kowski or Ten Konetsky, tackles;
Steve Petro and Al Lezouski,
guards, and Bob Dannies, center,
will be up front for Pitt.

The “dream backﬁeld” of Gold-
berg, Cassiano, Stebbins and
Chickerneo will pace the Suther-
land scythe. None of Pitt’s earlier
opponents have succeeded in slow-
ing up the touchdown proclivities
of these “dreamers”, but they

haven't met the Fordham line yet. =

The stadium gates will swing
open an hour earlier than the usual

Metailurgists Centinue To Set Winning .
Pace In Engineering League Contest

While fraternity teams now ﬁll
the intramural schedule, Independ-
ent and Engineering League clubs
are nlaying only occasionally.

Only a little more than a week
remains before the close of the
regular season. The ﬁnal game in
the Independent League is set for
Monday, November 7, at 4 o’clock,
and the title match in the Engi-
neering loop will be played off on
Wednesday, November 9, at 4
o’clock.

The Metallurgists continue as
the class of the Engineerirg cir-
cuit by topping all three opponents
who have faced them so far. In
each match, the Mets have looked
better, their latest victim havfng
been the Chemical Juniors. Despite
a lopsided 19-0 win over Electrical
B, the Chemical boys fell easy vic-
tims to the deadly passing combi-
nations of Mann to Leith to
Pataky.

The Chem Frosh and Civil Engi-
neers loom as the only possibl
serious opponents for the Mets. The
last setto scheduled for the win-
ner’s bracket has the Mets facing
one of those two teams on Wednes-
day, November 2, at 5 o’clock.

Today at 5 o’clock, the Chemical
Juniors will make an attempt to
get back on the victory path
against the once defeated Indus-
trial Engineers. The winner will
advance to the ﬁnal spot in the
loser’s bracket with the decisive
game due on November 4 at 5
o’clock.

The loser in the ﬁnal winner’s‘ be run over a one and ﬁve-eighths

November 8 at 5 o’clock. The ﬁnal
bracket battle will take on the
winner of the loser’s bracket on
game of the regular season be-

tween the winner of the winners’

bracket and the winner of the
loser’s bracket will take place on
November 9.

A far different setup confronts
clubs in the Independent League.
Here, no outﬁt has shown— par-
ticularly brilliantly and the out-
come of the tournament remains
a tossup between several teams.

The Newman Club nine tackle
the Floogies on November 1 at 4
o’clock to decide the champion of
the winner’s division; the loser will
meet the victor in the loser’s
bracket on November 3 and the
ﬁnal be'.ween the two survivors
will occur November 7.

Of the entire league, the New-
man Club seems to be the most
potent combination. Led by Burke,
Ellis, and Joe Kristufek, the New-
amns showed a versatile attack in
early games. However, the league
is well enough balanced that no
particular team can be rated a
deﬁnite favorite.

Other intramural sports have
been slowed by unfavorable
weather. The only important an-
nouncement is that Clarence Shep-
hard, cheer leader extraordinary,
has been placed in charge of tennis
for the remainder of the season.

As previously announced, the In-
tramural cross-country race will

mile course in Schenley Park on
November 16, with entries due at
the Intramural Oﬁice no later than
6 o’clock, November 4.

Competition in the meet will be
on a team basis, no less than three
men and no more than six men
comprising a team. Any team in
any league may enter a team. The
race will be run on an all-league
basis so that a team, to win the
championship of its league, must
ﬁnish ahead of all other members
of its league, regardless of where
the team may ﬁnish in the race.

Unattached men may enter the
race by forming a team or by run-
ning singly for the open champion-
ship. Any further details may be
secured at the Intramural oﬁice,
Trees Gym.

Pitt Harriers
Race Rams

Coach Olson’s brilliant cross-
country runners open their home
season today at 4 o'clock when they
oppose the Fordham team at the
Schenley Park course. Although the
Fordham runners are rated as one
of the outstanding teams in the
East, Olson is conﬁdent that his
well-balanced outﬁt will garner
enough points to insure a victory.

over the Rams, who are better
known in Pittsburgh as one half of
the “Goose Egg” combine. There is
a rumor which will be conﬁrmed at
the rally by the several speakers,
that this year’s Panthers, the o‘.her
half of the combine, are out to ﬁn-
ish the three lean years of score-
less ties.

The seating arrangement, de-
signed to spur the activities of the
various groups, will ﬁnd the Dents
facing the Engineers, with the
cheering block in between to act as
a colorful peacemaker and referee.

The B u s in e s s Administration
School and the College have been
placed in sections where “they can
do the most good.”

The ﬁrst pep-meeting of the cur-
rent football season, today’s rally
will serve to heighten the already
feverish anticipation and lip-
smacking which tomorrow’s game
has brought on.

Judging from the popularity of
the rallys in the past and from the
interest in the fourth meeting be-

For November Production

“Two daughters of a wealthy
family, one beautiful, one boyish,
and a happy-go-lucky youth look-
ing for a holiday . . . ”

That, according to Buell White-
‘hill, Pitt Players director, is a very
condensed version of the show that
starts the Player's new season-
Philip Barry’s “Holiday.”

“Holiday,” to be presented in the
Stephen Foster Memorial on No-
vember 2 and 3, was a Broadway
hit of several years ago, and a re-
cent movie success.

According to business manager,
Harrison Dick Chandler, E39, tick-
ets at 50 cents each can be pur-
chased in 1617 or 804 Cathedral.

Chandler has also announced a
season rate of one dollar for the
three productions, “Holiday,” “Klfld
Lady,” and “Brother Rat.” Begin-
ning Monday, a Players booth w-1l
be situated on the ground floor
near the elevators.

Eleanor Haught, C39, and Angus‘.
Hoffman, C39, are cast as Linda
Seton and Johnny Case; Linda’s
sister, Julia, is portrayed by Peggy
Nelson, C40.

Their father, Edward Seton, self-
satisﬁed money-man. and their

Inferfrat Victors Capitalize
On Heavy Passing Atfack

Lambda Chi, Phi Dzlt, and Delta
Tau Delta, three of the outstand-
ing teams in last year’s league,
advanced to the second round
Tuesday with impressive wins over
Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Mn,
and Theta Chi, respectively.

PHI DELT OFFENSE -

The Delts showed a ﬁne all
around backﬁeld in Cooper,
Stickle, Kennedy, and Williams,
and two exceptional ends in Jones
and Holt. The 12-0 score fails to
indicate the margin the Delts held
over Theta Chi.

Cooper’s southpaw tosses set up
the ﬁrst score which was made on
an end sweep by trackman
Stickle, and his toss in the end
zone to Stiekle accounted for the
other touchdown. Jones’ drop-
kick was short on the ﬁrst extra
point, and a bad pass from center
spoiled Holt's attempted place-
ment for the second point after
touchdown.

Phi Delta Theta showed plenty
of power as it romped to a 26-0
victory over the Sarnmies. Pass-
ing by Bernie Cashdollar and “Pee
Wee” Park featured the attack.
The ﬁrst score came from a 30-
yard toss by Cashdollar to “Sleep-
er” Black in the end zone. Ferris
dropped Park’s pass over the line
on the extra point. Another pass,
Ceshdollar to Smith, was good for
20 yards and a touchdown. Parks’
pass to Black accounted for the
thirteenth point.

PASSING ATTACK

In the second half Cox batted a
Sammy pass behind the line, and
Witherspoon pulled the ball out of
the ozone and raced 20 yards for
a score. Todd’s drop—kick went
awry. The ﬁnal Phi Delt touch-
down resulted from a pass of
Park’s behind his own goal line to
Larry Smi:h who snagged the
ball onpthe ten and scampered 50
yards down ﬁeld to the goal.

The 1937 champs, Lambda Chi
Alpl1a,~won over a much inferior
Kappa Sigma team, 19-0. Charley
Lynch and Leo Besch continually
threw strikes all afternoon to give
Lambda Chi the victory. The ﬁrst

touchdown came in double quick

/95-
time—approximately two minutes
after the opening whistle. Lynch
threw to Dick Besch in the end
zone and the champs chalked up
six points.

The pass gained about 25 yards.
A pass into the end zone failed to
click for the extra point. The
second Lambda Chi six-pointer
came about two minutes before
half time. This time Lynch whip-
ped a pass to Leeper in the end
zone. The scoring play started
from the Kappa Sig 20 yard line.

Little time was wasted in the
second half by Lambda Chi when
they added their last touchdown.
After three minutes of play
Lynch passed 15 yaids to Dave
Leese in the end zone for another
score. Leo Besch split the uprights
for the extra point with Lynch
holding.

TODAY'S GAMES

Today’s games pit Phi Delta
Theta against the winner of Phi
Ep-PiKA skirmish, at 3 o’clock
and at 4 o’clock Lambda Chi goes
out for its second win against the
winner of Phi Kap-SAE contest.

Sa'.;urd-;y morning ﬁnds the
completion of the second round
match and beginning of the third
round games. Two games are
scheduled for 9 o’clock. One game
ﬁnds Kappa Sigma stacking up
against the loser of the Phi Kap-
SAE game and also SAM battling
the loser of the Phi Ep-PiKA con-
test. At 10 o’elock the winner of
Thursday's Delt-Pi Lam game
takes on the winner of Lamba Chi
vs. Phi Kap-SAE victors.

Ice Team
Practice
Begins

With the Duquesne Garden ice
replacing the generally accepted
worm as the acme of something or
other, the hockey early birds re-
ported at 6 o’clock Tuesday morn-
ing for their first scheduled work-
out of the season. Forty-ﬁve strong
went through a series of condi-
tioning exercises.

Stressing the importance of cor-
rect fundamentals, Coach McSor-
ley put the hopefuls through a
long drill of footwork and shoot-
ing, climaxed with a light scrim-
mage.

Last year’s squad with the ex-
ception of Paul Kennedy—lost
through graduation—is back en
masse, and, though no positions
are deﬁnite, it is expected to form
the nucleus of this year’s edition.
In a large turnout of newcomers,
a few show promise. The majority,
however, are experienced skaters
with little or no knowledge of stick-
handling.

“I’m inclined to be a little pes-
simistic over the lack of experi-
enced players,” said McSorley, “but
I hope to have a more balanced and
well-rounded team than we had last
year.”

Scheduled to meet John Carroll,
last year’s league leaders, Novem-

SFA, Rams Join
No Holiday Drive

8 Repeated‘ on the front page of
today’s News is an announcement
from Student-Faculty; Association
which ties in conveniently with the
large amount of publicity given to-
mo_rrow’s Fordham game through-
out this issue.

It is no trouble, of course, to
justify the prominent billing given
a football game which is being
featured in almost every newspaper
throughout the country as number
one game of the week.

A little more’ subtlety, however
must be employed in dealing with
SFA president John Downie’s time-
ly note on what are commonly
termed (hereabouts) “football holi-
days.” We use the-word subtle be-
cause we detect in President Down-
ie’s remarks the hint of a predic-
tion on the outcome of; the Pitt-
Fordham battle.

In other words, what Downie and
SFA are worried about is; this-
in case Pitt should defeat Fordham
tomorrow, which, according to peo-
ple who should know, is highly
probable, Monday would be a per-
fect set-up for one of those spon-
taneous football demonstrations
which have become so notorious of
recent ' years.

And one of these aforementioned
demonstrations. is just what SFA
and the faculty, with the hoped-
for cooperation of "the student body,
hope- to be able to avoid.

To this end, the announcement
asks students;“to cooperate . . . to
eliminate such unauthorized holi-
days with their accompanying noise
and undigniﬁed conduct.” At‘ the
same time a notice has gone out
to faculty members asking that
they hold all scheduled classes
next: Monday.

We sympathize with SFA in its
attempt to avoid any post-game
excesses. And we, whoregard such
demonstrations. as “sophomoric”
are happy to’ throw 1 our support
behind this SFA movement.

We have-too many fresh mem-
ories in mind of previous football
holidays: of that gloomy Monday
when an investigator for a promi-
nent national honorary fraternity
arrived on campus in the m7ddle
of a post-Notre Dame celebra-
tion; of vandalism by University
students on other Pittsburgh cam-
pi; of the customary police court
bailing-out scenes.

But after. all, this might be just
a little previous. According to a
gentleman, by name Sutherland, a
little matter-remains-to-be disposed
of tomorrow afternoonout on the
Stadium ﬁeld.

You Said It

GRADES SECONDARY
A. J. Purvis, Adrian college:

“No matter what your grades
are, you still have a chance.
Grades, after all, are only an in-
dication of what a student is leam-

 

_ ing from his courses."

EXPOSURE
Professor. William Jaife, North-
western university:

“Men and women tempered by
four years of - exposure to. disin-
terested scholarship are less likely
to fall victims to mass hysteria, to

corroding personal ambition and to’

stupid fashions. They are less-apt
to become cranks or disciples of
cranks.”

Ca mpus Canvass

Each week “Campus Can-
vass” will bring a question
timely and of student interest,
to be answered through ins
column by students picked at
random throughout the Uni-
versity. This week the ques-
tion is restricted to freshmen
only.

The QUESTION:

What made you decide to go to
college and why did you choose
the University of Pittsburgh?
What do you intend to do when
you graduate?

The ANSWERS:
John Knoll, CE, South high school.

I knew my future opportunities
would be greatly improved with 17
college education so I enrolled ii
college. ’

I chose Pitt against advice from
some people who insisted that I g'(
to Tech. Those people told me tho
I would be making a great mistake
in choosing Pitt, but I told them
that I thought any individual tha
really wanted to learn could get a
much education at Pitt as he could
anywhere. When I graduate I pla:
to go to Mexico and work for L
S. Steel.

Margaret Smith, BA, Beav-er Fall
high school:

When I graduated from higl
school I had my choice of four dif
ferent scholarships. I thought I’.
like Pitt best and I knew that i:
did offer a good course in the ﬁeli
in which I am interested.

I hope to graduate and when I
do I’d like to be a buyer for a de-
partment store—preferably in Nei
York City.

Winifred Haggerdy, Pre - Ed
Greensburg high school:

I came to Pitt because I felt the
the University offered a good coursc
in education.

I intend to teach when-I gradu-
ate. But if I marry after I havr
taught for some time I shall resig.
my position. I do not think ma:
ried women with outside su-ppor:
should teach.

Bill Reardoii, BA, Allegheny higl
school:

I was out of school for a year
and found that without a back-
ground, degree, or education I
could only get a “stoogin”’ job.
I wanted something better.

I decided that Pitt offered the
best business course in the city so
I came here. I would like to go
into retail selling when I graduate.

Betty Luck, C, South Hills high
school:

Why does anyone go to college?
I think that’s a silly question. I
came to Pitt because everyone in
our family goes to Pitt. I intend
to major in English because I want
to be a writer when I graduate.

Freda Valli, Pre-Ed, Cumberland
Township high school:

I came to college because I
wanted to have a better under-
standing of life.

I came to Pitt because‘ I. was
more familiar with the University
than any other school. I chose
Pittsburgh, too, because my adviser
in high school thought it best.

I intend to make my career a
professional one. Mine shall not be
a career of marriage. I. hope to
teach for a long time. If the “right
guy” comes along I'll stay away
from him—if I can, and I think I
can.

Dr. Bowman Finds Chinese

Calm About War Siiuation

Arriving home after a three-’‘‘

month trip which took him across
the Paciﬁc to the southeastern sec-
tions of Asia, Dr. John G. Bow-
man, chancellor of the University.
reports that the Chinese people as
a whole are not overly impressed
by the present war.

In his meager hut in the small
village sunk back in the hills, the
average Chinese lives a hoppy life,
concerned but little with the mil?-
Eary life of the nation, according
"0 Dr. Bowman.

He states that he chose China for
‘iis vacation because “I have always
been f:isci‘*ated by translations of
ancient Chinese literature. I wanted
to get from them what they had
wh'ch makes them the happiest
people of the world.

“I found that the Chinese have
an aesthetic response that we have
cheated ourselves from having.
Their reverence for ancestors and
rtrange reverence for learning have
made possible a balance between
material and spiritual aspects of
life.

“The true representative of the
Chinese is not to be found in the
~rowded seaport cities,” declares
Dr. Bowman. “Instead he is fou‘*d
back in the hill country tending his
mail patch of rice.”

Centering his stay around Kwang-
tung province, Dr. Bowman spent
most of his time in little villnges
‘ogether with his nephew, Theodore
Bowman, and a Chinese interpreter.
He also visited Con-‘.cn’s ﬁghting
inayor, Tseng Yang-Fu, a Univer-
zity graduate of 1924.

Chinese have a unique way of
choosirg government officials, he
'eveals. A long process of prepara-
tion begins when small boys gather
around evening councils to hear
deeds of their ancestors discussed.
if a certain boy shows exceptional
ability at listening or relating this

Library Gets
Rare Volume

Forty valuable books have been
donated to the University library
by the Rev. Dr. Maitland Alex-
ander, pastor emeritus of the First

Presbyterian church, J. Howard
Dice, University librarian, an-
nounces.

The books include many valu-
able folio size editions in Latin and
Greek as well as a number in Eng-
lish. Outstanding among the books
are Virgil’s “Buccolics, Georgics,
and Aene'd,” published in Paris in
1798; John Calvin’s “Epistles of
St. Paul and Epistle to the He-
brews,” published in Latin in 1551;
four volumes of the works of Isaac
Watts, published in 1810; and a
work of Plato, in Greek, published
in 1602.

Other important books in the
Alexander collection are: Two
volumes of New Testament Com-
mentary, 1727; Terence’s Com-
d'es, 1767; ten volumes and index,
“Sancti Aurelii Augustini Hip-
ponensis Episcopi Operus,” 1679-
1700; two volumes, “Synodicon in
Gallia Reformata.” 1692; and
Thomas TayIor’s “Commentary on
the Epistle of St. Paul to Titus,”
1658.

All of the books will be placed in
the general University library with
the exception of two volumes of
Boydell’s illustrations of the works
of Shakespeare by eminent British
artists; a large portfolio of “beau-
ties and curiosities; ten sections of
“New Gallery of British Art;” and]
Virgil’s “Buccolics, Georgics, and’
Aeneid, which will be deposited in
the library of the University's ﬁne
art department.

Dr. Alexander, a graduate of
Princeton university in 1892, served
as pastor of the First Presbyterian
church in Pittsburgh from 1899 un-
til 1927 when he was made pastor-
emeritus. He served as moderator
of the General Assembly of the
Presbyterian church in 1914. He

now lives in Sewlckley.

philosophy, he is afforded the op-
portunity to take an examination
sponsored by his village board of
elders.

If he is successful in the first ex-
amination, he is promoted to h'gh-
er tests, at the expense of his vil-
lage, which form the stepping
stones to the Peiping examination.
Students passing this last one are
automatically made government of-
ﬁcfals.

When a man is made an official,
his native village then declares a
week’s holiday of festivals and
fireworks, culminating in the erec-
‘Lion of a stone monument in his
honor before the house of his
parents.

China, claims Dr. Bowman, has
been uniﬁed by its war. The Japa-
nese, he said, are the most uniﬁed
people in the world, but if the Chi-
nese can stay as they are, the Japa-
nese cannot win.

Poems Translated

When Kenneth Duffy, graduate
student at the University, was
teaching English at the Academia.
Catolica in San Juan, Porto Rico,
he became so much interested in
the beauty of the U. S. possession
that he wrote a number of poems.

That was two years ago. This
month's issue of Alma Latina, lit-
erary magazine of the islands, car-
ries two of Duffy's poems trans-
lated into Spanish by Soledad
Llorens Torres, one of Puerto
Rico's outstanding women poets.

Duffy, a graduate of Duquesne
university in 1936, went to Porto
Rico that year to teach English in
the private Catholic academy. He
reports that English has been in-
troduced in the lower schools on
the island and that all textbooks
used in the high schools are in
English, although the students
never use English except in the
wchools. '- _ -
