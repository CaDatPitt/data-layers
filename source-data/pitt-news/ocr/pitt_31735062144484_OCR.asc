Sultan To Be Unveiled

At Freshman Swing

Want a carton of Lucky Strike cigarettes?

Well, then, guess who the

Sultan is! .

, The unveiling of the “Sultan” at the freshman dance, “Sul-
tan Swing,” to be held at the Schenley hotel on January 12, will

determine what lucky person wins a carton of cigarettes.

Clyde

Knight’s orchestra will furnish the music from 9:30 to 12:80

o’clock.

Cass Boyle, chairman of the
dance, has announced that all stu-
dents of the University are invited
“Some people have

thought that only freshmen were
permitted at the ‘Sultan Swing’.
That’s a mistaken id-ea_. The
dance will be open to the entire
student body.”

Business manager Larry Bur-
winkle said, “ ‘The Sultan Swing’
is going to be one of the best
dances of the year, and we hope
to receive the cooperation of all
the college boys and girls. They’re
the ‘ones who can help put it over
the top.” Assistant business man-
ager is Melvin Schiif.

Tickets for the dance are pur-
chasable by receipt, Schiff has
made known. “Students may [buy
a receipt from any member of
the ticket committee,” he said.
“Then, they may exchange the re-

ceipt for a ticket at.the booth on

Pitt Bond Drive
Exceeds Goal

The University bond drive ex-
ceeded its goal of $8,275 by more
than $20,000, it was disclosed
Tuesday by Jackie Goodman, C,
chairman of the drive. Bonds pur-
chased by students during the
campaign, from November 20 to
December 16, totaled $28,554.55.

“The enthusiasm and coopera-
tion of the student body was most
edifying,” Miss Goodman said.
“On behalf of myself and my
committee, I’d like to thank all
those wh-o purchased either bonds
or stamps during the drive. The

excess of $20,0:00 over our goal,

can only be attributed to the pat-
riotism and generosity of the Pitt
men and women in general.”

Assistant chairman Louise John-

son said, “Pitt students may be V

proud of their participation in the
Sixth National War Loan drive.
They did a ﬁne job, but yet they
realize the men overseas are de-
serving of much more than they

were able to lend. For that reason,‘

we are continuing bond sales in
the University.”

Miss Johnson disclosed that the
booth on the ground floor of the
Cathedral will be open every
Wednesday for the purchase of
bonds or stamps. During the next
two weeks, the booth will be
under the sponsorship of the War
Activities guild. Members of the
guild, headed by Anita Colonna,

Once upon a time, about the year 1864, a little negro baby
was born into slavery. He was just a very tiny baby, an orphan,
and couldn’t be considered of very much value to an owner for
a very long time. So he was traded for an old horse, which also
wasn’t worth much to its owner. He was reared in poverty, in
the South of post-Civil War days, and a formal education was
denied him.

But if this negro boy was refused an education, he did have
great intelligence. If he had no ﬁnancial wherewith, he did
have initiative. And to top it off, he had a heart as big as both.
So to make a long story short, he became one of the world’s out-
standing scientists—George Washington Carver, direct_or of
agriculture at Tuskegee Institute for 46 years.

Dr. Carver has been compared in his ﬁeld with Edison, Bur-
bank, and Steinmetz in theirs. He brought great wealth to the
South through his discoveries of new uses for the peanut and
sweet potato, and the commercial uses he found for corn stalks,
grass, and even weeds. During the years he spent at Tuskegee,
Dr. Carver could have made a fortune many times over, but he
refused to leave the Institute and gave all he earned to others.
He preferred to live in complete simplicity near his laboratory
until the day he died, Jan. 5, 1943.

In observing George Washington Carver Week, we are hon-
oring one of thetruly great men of our time and all—time. For
it is to men like Carver, the pioneers, that we owe our thanks
for making America what she is today.

Since this will be the last issue of The Pitt News until regis-
tration week of the new semester, we want to take this oppor-
tunity to say goodbye for a little while to you graduating seniors
and to wish you godspeed.

You know how much We’ll miss you, especially those of us
who have been right behind you for the past four years (dehy-
drated to 21/; years by the ttrimester plan for some). On one
hand we hate to see you leave behind the good times that were
ours here at Pitt. Those days of the demonstration block, the
Independent party, fraternity politics in SFA, the swimming
team, bonﬁre rallies and victory snake dances through Oakland,
picnics in Frick park during the summer session, ROTC parades
on the lawn and co-ed captains, Cap and Gown shows, and foot-
ball players running the elevators, and . . . well the list is endless.
But then, too, we ’re a little bit envious and anxious to join you
in your new life with the “working half.” There ’s not much
to say but . . . “Goodbye and good luck. We’ll be seeing you.”

There have been some weighty matters on our minds, so
here goes . . . —

The ﬁrst question in our third degree is shot at WAA.
Whatever happened to that wonderful idea of yours to send
school letters to Pitt boys overseas? After the ﬁrst one was
mailed off to “Ike” Icardi, we failed to hear of additional notes.
Or do we need bifocals to ﬁnd them on the ground ﬂoor bulletin
board? . -"'*"*‘~—"‘-‘*'
Question number two comes in the form of a suggestion.
What about a 'men’s lounge and a room comparable to the
women’s twelfth ﬂoor of old? Or have we missed the boat again?
At any rate, ’tis said that some would have some piano and a

little bridge of an afternoon.

To Student congress goes query three. All through foot-
ball season, there were accusations and general moaning tossed

- in the direction of our school spirit. Now that basketball is here.

students to -sit dumbly on their hands. What about the reor-

 Scribner, WU]?

Prot., Succumbs at 85

\_ Dr. Henry Sayre Scribner, professor emeritus of Greek at Pitt,
died January 4 in his home after an illness of six months. He was 85

years old.

Dr. Scribner came to Pittsburgh in 1889 to teach at the Western

University of Pennsylvania, now

Pitt. The student body at that

time numbered fewer than 100, the faculty consisted of 12 mem-

bérs, and the University consisted

of two small buildings on Perrys-

ville avenue. He served as pro-¢

fgssor and head of the Greek de-
ﬁartment for 44 years. In. 1929 he
 awarded the honorary degree
(if doctor of literature and was
named professor emeritus in 1933.

There were no women students
at the University when Dr. Scrib-
ner came, anl he witnessed the
struggle the first two women stu-
dents, Stella and Margaret Stein,
sisters, put up before the board
of trustees voted to admit them.

The former Pitt professor was
born in Plainﬁeld, New Jersey,
August 3, 1859, the descendant of
Thomas Sayre, co-founder of
South Hampton, Long Island, and
the nephew of Charles Scribner,
founder of the publishing house
‘of _that name. He attended Phil-
lips Exeter academy and then
Princeton university from which
he received his bachelor of arts
degree in ’88 and his master of arts
degree in 1886. He also studied
at the John Hopkins university
and later traveled and studied in
Europe, at Goettingen university,

Notice to Pre-Medical Students

All pre-medical students, who
expect to have the requirements
for entrance to medical school
completed by September 1,
1945, and who have not applied
for entrance to Medical School
are asked to report to the Col-
lege oﬂice, 1801 Cathedral of
Learning, during the week of
January 15 for a conference.

Shopping Lags

In December

According to the Bureau of
Business Research, at the Uni-
versity, business in the Pittsburgh
district showed a sharply declin-
ing tendency, during the month
of December in spite of record-
breaking pre-Christmas buying.
At the -end of November the
weekly index of business reached
a new high record, but began its
sag early in December to reach
the lowest levels in more than a
year.

Exceedingly cold weather and
deep snow, hampering transpor-
tation facilities, were partly re-
sponsible for the poor sh-owing in
December. Moreover, the fact that
Christmas day and New Year’s
day came on Mondays meant
longer holiday periods.

Gross sales of 11 Pittsburgh
st-ores in 1944 exceeded those in
1943 by almost 11 percent and
were the highest on record, even
though retail sales in the ﬁnal
week of December fell below those
in the same weeks a year earlier.
The Bureau states that the quality
of many types of merchandise was
inferior, and that retail prices
averaged somewhat higher this
year than last.

On a seasonally adjusted basis,
the Bureau’s index. of business
fell from 173.2 per cent of the
1935-39 average in N-ovember to
165.4 (preliminary) in December;
it was 170.5 in December, 1943,
and 158.1 in December, 1942.

Notice to presidents of all
social and honorary fraterni-
ties: If you have signed a con-
tract for a page in the 1945

and make an appointment with

original contributions through the
phonograph and movies. Among

Winnie the Pooh, Babar Stories,
Peter and the Wolf, Christophen
Robin and Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs. He is a member of
the Decca executive staff con-
cerned with education, a member
of the Music Educators’ Nati-onal
conference, and has made numer-
ous appearances before mu-sic edu-
cators throughout the country.

Mr. Luther wrote the songs for
Ginger Rogers’ recordings of
“Alice in W-onderand,” and is the
-author of a fairly recent book
Americans and Their Songs, Harp-
er, 1942. He was one of the ﬁrst
two vocalists chosen by Decca to
make recordings when the com-
pany was formed in 1934, the
other being Bing Crosby.

For the Stephen Foster anni-
versary program Mr. Luther will
play and sing Foster songs and
will give a running comment. Dr.

Tar. PITT NEWS

By Ursula Halloran

And to you good people we are
back again with another column
full of humor and satire. (Un-
quote.) But you’d better read our
column ﬁrst today. We hear that
Lenchner’s ghost writer is sick, so
Frat Facts is bound to be lousy.

It looks like Leap Year ended
with a bang, what with all the en-
gagements and weddings coming
oﬁ around Pitt. We’ll put the
oldest one ﬁrst, ’tho the news is
new. It’s a wedding: Mary Lou
McMeans and John Kauri. And no
one suspected, either. ’Nother
wedding is Jackie Schauer’s to
Dick Besch, a Pittite from ’way
back, the ﬁrst week of Christmas
vacation.

Big pre—Christmas event was
the ZTA formal at the University
club. Belle of the ball was Lois
(lt’s— better— riding- than - walking)
Woistman.

Did ya glimpse the pictures in
Sunday’s Sun-Tele of Cass Boyle
and friend for the “Sultan Swing,”
coming off (or did you know?)
Friday at the Schenley. Watch
out fellas, the girls are on the
loose for dates. There goes an-
other $2.40.

Francie Bluestone is moving to
Washington, D. C., and Pitt loses
a co-ed to George Washington U.
soon. To New Mexico next semes-
ter goes Ann Monteverde—to
Santa Fe to stay with her sister
for six months.

Among the newest duos on
campus is this John Ridinger-
Shirley Jennings business. He just

tan. Two more constant couples
are Peggy Dougherty and Jack
Mountford, Betty Poifenberger and
Chuck Tremont.

Flash-ing a beyootiful sparkler
nowadays is Betty Adams. It’s
med Jim Baker’s Christmas pres-
ent. Two more jools are being
worn by Judy Richmond (Ray
Lindsay’s) and Betty Thorpe (Bob
Galey’s the man in the picture
here).

And now, just to break the
monotony of all this cheer, Jo Ann
Magee and Jim Reber aren’t
pinned anymore. (Boo, hoo!)

Hitting Look magazine soon are

six ZTAs-—-look for ’em. It seems

r \. ', ‘V . _“

and Dick Barnhart

the mag is doing a story on Doc
Carlson and needed a bit of the
old (dare we say it?) in the pic-
tures. -

Another ring is Jug Crock’s
Christmas present from Bob
Seiforth. Pinnings - of - the-week
include Marcia Silverblatt and
dent Bill Lieberman, and also
over AEPhi way Shirley Blass (in
nursing school) and another dent,
Moe Jacobson.

What - is - this-thing-called de-
partment: Bebe Davis has had a
date for 29 days out of her navy
Lieutenant’s 30-day leave. Where
was he the other night?

Long distance romances. Two
(count ’em) -Kappas dashed to
Colorado during Christmas to see
their men. Mary Lou Myers in
Denver to see Howard Grebs (for-

mer air -cadet at Pitt) whose pin.

she’s wearing and has been wear-
ing since July. And Jane Frank-
lin to Colorado Springs to see
Sandy (Bill Sanford) who is man
of the moment, and, inside sources
say, The One. '

Wait! Wait! More rings. Marty
Shissler has traded her Sigma Chi
pin for a diamond. {Bud Charnell
gave it. Bud is home now and a
Lieutenant. Elaine Bullions is as
of now engaged to Lt. Jack How-
den.

(Ed. note) Item concerning
Halloran this week. She caught
the posies at Ruth Crawford’s
wedding. And now, my children,
what does that mean?

Ann Whitlinger had a neat three
days when her Yale man, now a
pre-med at Michigan, was home.
Aha!

Congratulations to all the girls
who made out during Leap Year.
A dirty handkerchief to all the
rest, who will be starting anew and
making their projects for 1945 the
same as the old ones for ’44.

And that closes the crummy lit-
tle column writ by Underwood-—
in a hurry—until next week. We'll
see ya all in the labor draft!

Let’s take the long way home.

Chinese Class
To Be Offered

Dr. Chiu Chun is en route to
Pittsburgh fr-om Chunking to take
a position as visiting pr-ofessor at
the University for the spring sem-
ester commencing February 5. He
will teach an introductory course
in the Chinese language and one
in Chinese culture.

Dr. Chiu received -the doctor of
edu-cation degree from Columbia
university. He has been a profes-
sor in several leading Chinese
universities and formerly was
lieutenant governor of Kiangsi
province. His appointment at Pitt
comes as a result of extended
negotiations conducted through
diplomatic channels. He is espe-
ciallyw-ell versed in Chinese liter-
ature and is said to be one of the
best interpreters of the Chinese
nation of today.

Lose Somethin’? Post Office
Crammecl F all, Says Earl

If you’ve lost it,‘ (anything but
your heart or head), we’ve found

it. A seemingly endless array of
objects, everything from al-pha to
omega, await your inspection in
the Post Ofﬁce lost and found de-
partment. So, please, all youse
squares cut out the neglect, and
come in and inspect.

This column is dedicated to all
those who have ever been in love.
and to those who can remember.
For in our gallery of forgotten
goods repose many thumb-worn
love-letters. -Now we know these
may have been placed in some
abandoned culvert for a mighty
good reason, but for heaven’s sake
come and get them, for they’re
driving Earl, the ‘give-me-a-
stamp’ man, crazy. (Reason: There
are a few lines in the second para-
graph of the one written to “My
Own Impetuous Algernon” that
he can’t ﬁgure out. (Moral: Who
knows?)

Proper identiﬁcation, including
-driver’s license, birth certiﬁcate,
and a letter from your dra-ft board
must be shown if you hope to
prove you are the owner of one,
(1), cigarette case containing cig-
arettes. (of all things). But here’s
the catch. Before taking any
further steps -the following data
must be ﬁlled in on special blanks
provided for the purpose: (1)
Brand, (2) Number of fags left
in the -pack, including choked
butts, (3) Length and texture of
each cigarette. and (4) “Have
they, or have they not tasted dif-
ferent lately? (No answers need
be provided if they are reefers.)

to be taught by Dr. Chiu will be
very comprehensive. It ‘will deal
brieﬂy with the following aspects
of Chinese culture: society, poli-
tics, agriculture and industry, art,
philosophy, and religion. By means
of this survey Dr. Chiu will en-
deavor to present an understand-
ing of the essence of Chinese cul-
ture as a whole.

' Details concerning Dr. Chiu s
program at the University will be
announced following his arrival

(and, therefore. obviously, man-
less) to call at the lost and found
office for the innumerable cos-
metic pouches that he has reason
to beieve were lost by these make-
upless belles. _

There are many babushkas
adorning the shelves of the lost

others just leave their origin to
be guessed. Won’t so-me one please
come f-or them and save them
from a horrible death at the hands
of the dusters. Such a fate should
not happen to Umbri-ago.

(If we have neglected to men-

obviously have NOT been found,
throw us some more corn and
we’ll peck out a few more items.))

That likeable lass . . that
vivacious femme . . . that dark-
eyed brunette . . . Anne Pascasio,
Ed, belies that old chestnut about
gentleman preferring blondes. ‘If
they do, they haven’t met Anne.)
One of Anne’s favorite pastimes
is eating ice cream. That is, when
she isn’t busy with one of her
many campus» activities which in-
clude: secretary of Women’s Self-
Government association, a mem-
ber of Student congress, Altar
guild, WSGA commission.

Boasting a contagious exuber-
ance for everything she does,
Anne’s chum.my smile and warm
personality account for her
“frien-d-winning” ways. A pas-
sionate lover of sports, she would
rather watch a football game than

' eat. -However, in addition to being

an ardent sports spectator, Anne is
also a. very active participant in
basketball, hockey, and swimming,
her three favorite sports.

She is already preparing for
her post-graduate role of physical
education teacher by instructing
classes four afternoons a week at
the Ellis school. Undoubtedly,
Anne’s» cheerful manner and sin-

cere interest in physical education

wbrk assure future success in her
career.

A peek into Anne’s private life,

won’t eat crackers in bed unless

When pressed: for a reiason, she
conﬁdes that peanut butter
cements the crumbs more ﬁrmly
and prevents their excessive scat-
tering.

Spooning away, no, not in the

tainous dish of ice cream in the

Farmer Gives Course

In Religious Discussion

Dr. William R. Farmer’s course
in religious appreciations will be

courses offered regularly by the
University. This course is only
given in occasional semesters and

ester of 1945 at the fourth hour
on Fridays. It is listed in the
schedule as Orientation 71.

The course takes the form of a
discussion group in which stu-
dents will c-onsider various related
problems of mankind. They will
dig into the past and evauate the
present in consideration of these
problems against religious back-
grounds.

Former Engineer)
Killed in Action

Lieutenant Marvin C. Johns, J r.,
a former student in the Me-
chani-cal Engineering department
(Aeronautical option) of the
School of Engineering, has been
reported killed while on training
detail in France, Dean E. A. Ho-
brook announced last week.

Lieutenant Johns had been a
pilot -on a bomber and had com-
pleted ﬁfteen missions over Ger-
many, and, after the invasion of
France, he was transferred to a
ﬂying ﬁeld there as a test pilot.
On October 24 he was in a tent
at his air -base when a lpane, in
taking off, crashed through the
tent and killed him. At the time,
he had been recommended for a
captaincy.

Do You Want To Be an Author?

Peterson Can Show You How

The phone buzzed sharply in
the little room of 328, and Pro-
fessor Edwin L. (Pete) Peterson
lifted the receiver.

“Professor Peterson?” queried
an excited voice. “Well, this is
Isabelle Malone. Professor, I’ve
sold by ﬁrst story to Collie’:-’s!”

Not a common happening, but
occurring often enough to cause
the associate English prof to be
pursued by potential authors from
all -over Pittsburgh and outlying
districts—a thing which keeps
Pete busy Ibrushing off doctors,
lawyers, engineers and insurance
salesmen who are determined to
ﬁght their way into an already
overcrowded ‘Pitt classroom. This
-onslaught for the night class is
due mostly t-o the achievements of
his day students.

Pete’s regular undergraduate
class in short story writing has,
since 1938, placed Pitt in the top
rank of all universities competing
in three famous annual writing
contests (sponsored respectively
by quality magazines Story, The
Atlantic Monthly, and Harper’s.)
He himself has -published a semi-
ﬁctional ‘book, and -stories in the
national circulation magazines.

In regard to all this buying of
his proteges’ stories, the prof had
this to say “Pitt students can
write, and there’s no getting
around that. But they haven’t
been «publishing, and that’s a
shame. My object is to teach the
students primarily how to write
short stories, however. The course
is not «based on commercial jour-
nalism.”

For those hopefuls who are
chalking up nice, fat A’s on their
themes, Pete added, “It doesn’t
follow that the ones who did best

in an advanced composition course
will do so well in my course. It’s
the story that matters, not the
turning of phrases.”

That warning will probably be
offset by the appealing facts that
a Peterson pupil to-ok ﬁrst prize
in the 1940 contest, and that an-
other pupil won ﬁrst place in the
Story contest in 1941, thereby
breaking a long tra-diti-on—Har-
vard had won this coveted prize
three years running before. Pitt
students who are apt in “turning
phrases,” as the professor termed

it, will continue to look forward
to being Peterson savants. Every-
one wants to know how to write
a short story «that will sell, and
Professor Peterson -seems to be
able to tell them how it’s do-ne.

An angle that rather coincides
with this story-selling ability is
the fact that the popular c-ourse
has also become a little clearing
house for novels. “Publishers are
frantic for novels now,” said the
prof. “At the time, I have six
novels on the ﬁre
stages of completion. Occasionally
I get manuscripts from as far as
Somerset, Pa.”

All the would-be novelists in
the University will please walk,
not helicopter, to the third ﬂoor.

The Pitt News started off the
new year right by leaving out my
column last week, but I'm back
now and will continue to be here
until I’m drafted, which may be
any day now. And that reminds
me that Barnhart, our local gos-
siping gazetteer, recently register-
ed for selective service, and his
draft board calls Pittpourri non-
essential. I agree.

The slightly less than sensation-
al news from the Phi Eps this
week is that they have moved to
new headquarters in the Pilot
house of the Hotel Webster Hall.
The boys are quite thrilled with
the new setup and promise ah
open house for everyone early
next semester.

The Phi Gams and Phi Delts
have informed me that their joint
affair did come off last Saturday
evening. The dance was held at
the Fiji house and featured a room
decorated by each of the frater
nities. -

.The Phi Kaps said goodbye to
their president, J. Matthew Smith
on Christmas night when he left
for the merchant marine. Smith
is reported to be sailing for Mur-
mansk, Russia. _

The SAES had a hell week last
week for seven men. The new
initiates are Dick Porco, George
Russon, Chris Luccy, ‘Erwin
Panek, George Polimus, Felix
Hedzior, and Barkett Haddad.
After gaining seven new brothers,
the !SAEs lost four others to the
Navy. They are Eddy Kurtz, Ber-
nie Sniscak, E'd-dy Sebastion, and
Al Capozzi.

The Pi Lams are well under way
in practice for this year’s basket-
ball tournament. Like Doc Carl-
son, the Pi Lams promise to “Win
’em all.” ‘

The Sigma Chis also increased
their ranks last week by having
a hell weekl and initiation. Joseph
Pahlow, And-rew Cumming, James
Armour, Jerry Bosnak, an-d Ed-
ward Gentille are the newest
members of the fraternity.

about semester recess-—only ten
more days. What a life of leisure
we Pittites live,

that my colleague, Buddy, doesn’t
know me from Eve( as the say-
ing might well go.) I guess it isn’t
such a small world after all.

it’s a scoop. I didn’t know about it

before. Their address is 137 North)

are busy as bees, preparing to.
move on the thirteenth of Jan-
uary. .

Those altar-headed Phi Sigs
who certainly have a share" of
recent marriages to their credit,
are giving away another bride on

February 11 at the Hotel ‘Schen-
,ley. This time it is Mid Donofo

sky, a graduate of February '44,
who will wed Jack Wiese.

Today is the day for the Phi
Mu’s tea dance in honor of the
Delts.

And now for the results of the
Tri Delt’s raffle drawing on De-
cember 11. The first prize, a $100
war bond, was won by a train
conductor from Blairsville. A
Braddock nurse won the second
prize, a $50 bond, and the third
prize, a $25 bond, stayed here at
Pitt with a freshman, Betty Rog-
ers. .

“Y”To Conduct

Boxing Classes

With the shipyards and steel
mills employing women and mak-
ing them stronger and better able
to resist the advances of the domi-
nant sex, the Pitt YMCA has de-
cided that the time has arrived
for a little action on the part of
the men around the school. So, a
boxing class, sponsored by the “Y”
will begin tomorrow evening at
7:30 o’clock in the Cathedral gym.

Instructors for the class will be
Charles Berg, BA, and Bob Bork,
C. The Pitt “Y” will supply all
the necessary equipment and a
bang-up time will be had by all
who are interested. Later in the
year, competition with other “Y”
boxers or a tournament for Pitt
men may be scheduled.

So, all Pitt men who desire to

 

Panthers Play

Tilt Tonight At Skibo Gym

’With two victories already jotted down in the books, the Win ’em
All Phantom quintet has reloaded its double barreled shot guns and
is aiming for two more wins this week over traditional rivals, Car-

negie Tech and Penn State.

Tonight, the peppy cagers meet their up-street neighbors, the

affairs with Pitt walking away with 63-33 and 52-33 victories.

Last year’s tussles were one sided

This

year, however, Max Hannum has put together a stronger all fresh-

men squad.

Tech has already won three
times as many games this season
as they did last year when they
nosed out Case for their lone win
of ’44. Tech inaugurated its pres-
ent campaign with a 27-25 victory

over Slippery Rock and made it
two in a row by handing Case a
52-40 defeat. The Tartan win
streak was snapped at two when
the Geneva Covenenters walloped
them, 65-35. They took it on the
chin again when the Westminster
Titans nosed them out in the ﬁnal
quarter. The Plaid got back into
the win column Saturday night
with a 56-3'1 victory over Juniata.

Dr. Carlson expects to start a
revamped line up against Tech.
Replacing Hank Zellers at the cen-
ter post will be Jacobson. Phil
Marder will start in place of Tay
Malarkey at forward. Both Ja-
cobsen and Marder displayed ﬁne
form against Geneva. At the
guards will be Dodo Canterna and
Frank Morris, who have remedied
their college fright on the court.
Nate Apple is slated to start at his
usual forward post.

Both Dr. Carlson and Max Han-
num will have their boys out there
ﬁghting every minute, but Coach
Hannum stated that “The Pitt
squad is too old and too experi-
enced” for his team of 17 year
olds.

Penn State
Comes Here

Saturday

When the Skyscraper-ﬁve play
host to Penn State on Saturday
night, they will -have reached the
one-third mark in the Pitt war-
time schedule. ‘This encounter will
mark the second one in as many
evenings f o r Coach John
Lawther’s team which will be
fresh from a contest with Carne-
gie’s Tartans.

Many remember the freeze
game the Carlsonmen empliyed
last season against State’s block-
ing zone, and time will tell what
the dictor has up his sleeve for
Saturday. Last year’s two battles
supplied little excitement to the
fans as the ball was merely pass-
ed around and little shooting took
place. This year Pitt might sur-
prise the Staters. Hank Zellers’
6—foot-3 frame keeps th e back
board under control and Tay Ma-
larkey’s accurate shooting from all
parts of the hardwood will keep
the Staters’ zone charging which
may help the local rooters forget
the 15-12 and 35-29 losses suffer-
ed last season.

The Lions ﬂoor one of the
weakest teams. in many a year.
They boast of no extraordinary
height n-or individual stars. State
has one player! back from last
season, Vic Danilov and the re-
mainder of the team are Navy
and Marine trainees. State’s rec-
ord is far from impressive, win-
ning three and losing two with
two more games remaining before
they meet Pitt. Susquehanna and
Marshall supplied little opposition
but it took an overtime period to
best Bucknell.

  wediieséay, 10, M1945 ‘

  

By Moe Sptegel, Sports Editor

When I was passing out gifts in December, I gave the University
a couple of presents and they, in turn, said “Well, Moe, we’ll be nice
to you also. When January rolls around, we’re going to give you the
gate.” So, it looks like they weren’t kidding. I’m through. Finished.
Washed up—-as far as the PITT NEWS is concerned. I guess I’m not
the first who had to sit down and write a farewell column. I won't be
the last either. However, I never thought I would be sorry to gradu-
ate from this joint. It’s been fun being sports editor.

The Carlson Cuties

I’ve seen Doc Carlson’s latest bunch of ice cream eaters in action
only once and that was when they fumbled their way to a 49-45
verdict over a fair Geneva quintet. That one game was enough for
me. I am now sure that “Coach Cliff Carlson’s captivating Cuties,
cream consumers conclusively, can crush, certainly cremate, country-
wide college combinations. Careful, Carnegie.”

My Two Cents Worth

A recent journey to New York’s Madison Square Garden allowed
me to see C.C.N.Y. in a-ction against Hamline and Long Island Uni-
versity battle Wyoming’s elongated Cowboys. Hamline, recipient of
much publicity in the press, pulled a mild surprise by downing City
in a thriller, 47-42. Now, Hamline is a small college in St. Paul,
Minn., with an enrollment of 97 men and 350 co-eds. Included among
its small group of males are two youngsters who pick up a little change
during the summer by playing baseball. These two, Howie “Stretch”
Schultz and Rollie Seltz also play basketball for their college but they
don’t get paid for this. It is probable that many colleges throughout
the country are, shall we say, re-imbursing their cagers handsomely.
But, Hamline began to get bawled out by the Amateur Athletic Union
because it was using professional players. What a laugh. I didn’t see
Schultz, the Dodger’s ﬁrst baseman in the summer, smack one home-
run against the City boys. And, Seltz, a second sacker for Rochester
in the International League, didn’t even handle one double-play ball.
There were no ball gloves, no bats, no bases, not even any pop bottles
on the Garden court. Pat Kennedy, the referee, did plenty of yelling
during the game but he didn’t call even one player out for stealing
second base. This was basketball, not baseball.

I don’t think that baseball had anything to do with the fact that
Seltz proved to be a pain in the neck to the City boys by heaving ten
one-handed push shots through the hoop from the side of the court.
And, any fair athletic as tall as the 6-foot-7 Schultz could have con-
trolled the rebounds as did the Hamline senior who also made 11
points. The A.A.U. says that a pro athletic in any sport cannot com-
pete against amateurs in any sport without the amateurs losing their
status. Some baloney. I bet that I could lick plenty of pro base-
ballers or footballers in ping pong any day in the week. And I’m a
simon-pure, too.‘

Pitt Could Take ’em All

I'm positive that our Panthers, or Phantoms, or Cuties, or what-
ever you want to call them, could whip each of the four teams that
played at the Garden. L.I.U. topped Wyoming, 47-40, in a slow,
dull engagement. The Westerners, with a 6-foot—l0-inch freshman
from Long Island at center, displayed the slowest brand of basketball
I have ever seen. Boy, what pumpkins they were. Long Island was
fair.

Not one of the teams could boast of players who are as good at
shooting like little Apple or steady Tay Malarkey. There wasn’t a
center to match the ﬁne work of Hank Zellers and Canterna, Morris,
Marder and Michalic would all make better guards than any I saw in
action.

Therefore, Doc Carlson, I think that you have “IT” this year and
here’s wishing you and your boys a “Win ’em All” season.

Well, that’s all there is, there ain’t no more of Moe. SO LONG.

Canterna   Chose Court Sport  
In Preference to Baseball

A
V

Meet Oland Canterna, Pitt guard,
who is known as “Dodo” to all his
friends. “The name is a carry-
over from my childhood days,”
says the blushing freshman who
stands an even six feet into the
air and tips the scales at a solid
166 pounds. v

Dodo hails from Freeport where
he starred in athletics for Free-
port high. He modestly reveals

that he earned six letters at the
school where he was a four-year
man in both basketball and base-
ball and a two-year man in foot-
ball, holding down an end posi-
tion. Dodo must have been as
much of a standout in the diamond
sport as he is in basketball. Play-
ing a brilliant game at shortstop,
Canterna confesses that he re-
ceived very tempting offers from
the Detroit Tigers, the New York
Yanks and other top outﬁts. “I
had to choose between basket-
ball an-d baseball,” he admits,
“and I’m glad that I pick-ed bas-
ketball.” So, with all that money
dangling before his eyes, old Dodo
came to Pitt instead, and no one
is sorry. But, getting back to high
school and basketball again. Dodo
and Freeport High captured two
Section 5 titles in a row in Class
A, WPIAL competition. Then, in
an independent cage tournament
last year in Sharon, the club
which was an outside chance in
the tourney was the quintet with
Canterna. Playing against many
college cagers Dodo and his mates
not only copped the laurels but
Canterna was put on the all-tour-
ney team an-d was chosen the out-
standing player in the competi-
tion, winning himself a handsome
trophy.

Two brothers have also been in
the district basketball spotlight.
Dom Canterna played at Salem
college with the great “Brooms”
A-bramovich, and Bill did a little

Honorary Journalistic Group
Recognizes Women in Field

Xylon Pitt’s honorary journal-
istic fraternity for women, was
founded on campus in May, 1926.
Organized because of an apparent
need, its six founders, colleagues
on the Owl, received permission
from Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean
of women, to charter Xylon. These
reasons were given_Miss Amos as
incentive for founding Xylon: To
encourage women «to interest
themselves in journalism, to pro-
mote a department of journalism
at the University, and to furnish a
means of recognition for women
achieving success on the staffs of
Pitt publications.

Using Theta Sigma Phi, national
women’s journalism fraternity, as
a pattern, Xylon inaugurated ac-
tivities on campus. A fraternity
pin of onyx and gold with the
Phoenician X as an emblem was
especially designed for them by
Hardy and Hayes, Pittsburgh jew-
elers. Colors of gold and bronze
were adopted and a ritual was
planned. The Xylograph, a booklet
for freshmen was published-——teas
were given to introduce prospec-
tive Xylonites to the actives —
trips were taken through the Post
Gazette———contes.ts were sponsored
for journalistic reporting and con-
tests between high school news-
papers—and the year was cli-
maxed with a spring banquet. This
May Xylon will celebrate its
twentieth anniversary. Many Xyl-
onites have achieved success in
the ﬁeld of journalism—-three of

these are: Maxine Garrison, Elaine
Kahn and Betty McMahan.
Although Xylon has been al-
most inactive these past war
years, it is being revived this year
by its officers: Virginia Volkay,
president; Jacqueline Goodman,
vice-president, and Signe Win-
stein, secretary-treasurer. Month-
ly meetings are held at which
noted women in the journalistic
ﬁeld speak on probems of women
in journalism. The Xylonites have
been the ﬁrst group ever to be
asked to join the Pittsburgh Ad
Club at its luncheon meetings.
On Tap Day,
women who have completed three
semesters of work at Pitt with a
scholastic average of 1, who carry
12 credits and who have done out-
standing work on some campus
publication will be tapped to
membership. These tappees will
be initiated at the annual initia-
tion banquet in the spring.
Although war has curtailed its
activities, Xylon, using its pur-
pose for organizing as a motto, is
striving- to maintain a normal
schedule at Pitt. Despite these
curtailments in activities, women
today face a world that, due to
the war. is having to accept them
into the ﬁeld of journalism. With
this challenge, Xylonites are striv-
ing to show themselves worthy of
this acceptance and -to prove that
women are capable writers, de-
serving a place in the journalistic
ﬁeld now and in post-war years.
