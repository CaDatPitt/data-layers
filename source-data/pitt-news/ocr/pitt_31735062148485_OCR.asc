Vote Petitions

Freshman H Officers
Lead Drive to Get
C ‘Voice in“ Politics

Petitions requesting Univer-

sity authorities to grant
Pharmacy School students the
right of participation in stu-
dent elections were being cir-
culated‘ through the undergrad-
ate student body of the Boulevard
of the Allies school this week.
‘This latest development in the
already-confused state of student
politics in the University is report-
ed to be under the sponsorship of
two freshman class officers, Ralph
Pi-ccirillo, P43, chairman of the
freshman Pharmacy, dance, and
wmiam Babalis, P43, giiassistant
chairman. Babalis, records show,
was a former student in the School
of Business Administration.
Pharmacy Not Represented

Circulation of the petition is in-
tended to acquire for Pharmacy
students the same privileges as
students in the College, School of
Business Administration, Schools of
Engineering and Mines, and School
of Dentistry, the leaders of the
movement say. '

' At the present time the School
of Pharmacy is the only under-
graduate division "in the University
which does not have representa-
tion in the Student-Facu1ty;_As-
sociation. , . . C. . _ . ._
 According to Theodore ‘W. Biddle,
assistant dean of men in charge of
student activities,‘ the reason‘ the
School of Pharmacy is not repre-
sented today is that heretofore they
have not demonstrated much V in-
terest in activities’ or student gov-
ernment on the Oakland campus of
the University.

Majority’ vote Required

' Asked’ what success this week’s
action on ‘the part of School of
Pharmacy students might produce,
Mr. Biddle cited article three: of
the SFA..-,constitutio'n~‘ which pro-
vides that “students of any other
school or division may become
members of the association by a
majority vote of their respective
voting registrants.”

At the present time the assem-
bly of SFA consists of 40 mem-
bers, 30 students and ten- faculty
members from the schools belong-
ing to the association. Whether
faculty members of the School of
Pharmacy were also included in the
petition _‘-;could not be learned this
week. I , .. '
Cusick Outlines Procedure

Althoughinot officially informed
of the franchise movement, Pat
Cusick, E40, president of SFA, de-
scribed the action as “a highly un-
usual situation,” and outlined the
possible procedure Which they
might follow.

First step would be to secure a
complete registration of the entire
undergraduate School of Phar-
macy student body with the of-
fice of the dean of men, Cusick
ventured. Other members of un-

Sniffs Way Through Panther

By Nancy Welfer

Hiding behind a cover showing
life in the raw and reportedly (we
have a cold) smelling of gardenias,
Pitt Panther again ventured forth
on campus last Wednesday. The is-
sue, which we have promised to
bring back alive, was dedicated “to
the ladies—God bless them!”

Half-way between the two covers
is the prize, a collection of nine pic-
tures of men whom Fanny Panther
would like to date but doesn’t. The
photos, ranging from Dick Cassiano
to Bob Good, might have been a lit-
tle lighter, but then, as one of our
friends once said, “Kalwary is much
nicer in the dark.”

Bob Gestrich, and Dave Tucker,

Getting back to pictures we might
mention the series on “Lines as Seen
at the Tea Dance,” interpolated with
a shot from a publication’s snow-
party. The captions, for which we
are grateful, are getting easier to,

read each time. And the pictures,
with the possible excepton of the
unidentiﬁable News staff, are not at
all bad.

Several articles giving a man’s
opinion of women’s rushing, Frank
Miller’s suggestions as to how to
recognize a girl whO’S going Steady,
and Dick Kay’s decision as to wo-
men and swing music are also pres-
ent. We remain neutral on all three
points.

bewildered about a couple of points;
just when is Scholar’s Day, and
what was Rosalind Russell doing

around a tripwriter?” Could they

possibly mean “tripewriter,” which.

it has often been called, or merely
the good old-fashioned “typewrit-

Amity Club
Reorganizes
On  Basis

Hartmangaﬂopes Dues,

 Exclusive Policies: '

Will Help Reputation
By Ed Beigel ,

, Resulting from general disorgani-
zation and a growing lag in inter-
est, Amity Club will be reorgan-
ized on an exclusive, dues-paying.
basis. A I V

According to the new plan re-
vealed today by Robert Campbell,

C41‘, a membership committeeiwill
accept names of any‘University stu-
dent, and invite potential; members
to attend meetings and social af-
fairs, prior to granting member-
ship.

Hartman Explains Change

Characterizing the reputation of
the organization’ as “cheap” and

“unimportant” among University
students, because of its generality
and openness, George Hartman.
Ed40, founder and ﬁrst president,
explained that through a dues-pay-
‘ing system and a selective member-
ship, the organization could con-
tinue its original purpose—provid-
ing low-cost social activities to stu-
dents who otherwise would have no
social life—and maintain an “in-

Hterested” membership, as well.

Originally organized, and recog-
nized’ by SFA in May, 1938, Amity

- Club provided low-cost ‘social func-

tions that, in_ the absence of a
student union, were unavailable to
non-fraternity, or other non-organ-
ization students.

ﬁggnclusivef, Character ‘ , 
' Since interest was prevalent only

at the time of a dance or reception,
which both University and non-
University students attended, and a
general disorganization prevailed,
the present members have voted to
place the club on a basis attained
by other organizations—-with a deﬁ-
nitely functioning treasury.

There has been no plan to limit
the membership of the club, but
an “exclusive” character is implied.
Membership dues will be one dollar
a month, payable at each bi-monthly
meeting. Amity Club will now
function as a semi-private organi-
za.tion, partly to establish its own
reputation as more than “just an-
other open house affair,” partly to
provide its membership with a deﬁ-
nitely organized social organization,
and partly to strengthen the group
sufficiently so that it can plan a
deﬁnite social program and provide
a fraternal group to those who are
capablebut ﬁnancially unable to
join the more expensive, larger so-
cial fraternities on campus.

Operatic Stars
Sing at Mosque

Three renowned singers of the
Metropolitan Opera company will
be featured with the Pittsburgh
symphony in the entire ﬁrst act
of Wagner’s opera, “Die Walkure”
at both of the concerts this week-
end at the Syria Mosque.

Lauritz Melchoir, tenor, will sing
the role of Siegmund; Helen Traui
beli, soprano, will be heard as
Sieglinde; and Emanuel List, basso,
will sing the role of Hunding.

The opera, which will comprise
the second half of the program, will
be presented in concert form.

Color Schemes

Original Roman Glamour Girls Wore Brighter
Lipstick Than Modern Beauties, Says Dr. Geise

By Ray Palkot

If the Roman empire were as per-
manent as the lipstick that was
used by Roman school girls, we
would still be talking the language
now used only at the head of fancy
diplomas.

For the Roman girl went two
steps further than the modern wo-
man. She not only dyed her lips
instead of using a temporary color-
ing, but she used a variety of col-
ors, usually green, purple, or some-
l'll’Il'.”.‘.~‘ red.

The startliné.’ theory of lips to
match the color of the tunic was re-
vealed by Dr. John J. Geise, pro-
fessor of history. “Either the R0-
man women.” he said, “were indif-
ferent or they were very efficient.

Instead of carrying lipsticks around
with them, they merely dyed their
lips the color they desired.”

Then too, Dr. Geise said, if the
women didn’t like the color. of their
hair, they changed it! Blondes were
at the highest premium"'th‘én.

You don’t have to go-downnto the
ﬁve and ten, Dr. Geise ;,said,,_to get

face powder if you do asthe Roman 0

girls did. All you have to‘“do‘is to
go down into your cellar‘, zopen up
a can of white lead and then rub it
over your face. If that doesn’t suit
you. smash un some of little sister’s
blackboard chalk and rub it over
ynzir face. The Romans used both.
The college .‘..Yll.‘lS who will shortly
appear in onen-wide open-toed
shoes from which protude toe nails

‘. ._ burnt almonds,

luciously covered with red paint "
have nothing on the Roman lassies. .

It was common practice not only to
paint the finger nails but also the

., toe nails all shades of the rainbow.- .~

Then, there. was the ancient

“Mascara,” Dr.‘ Geise added. It I
was nothing more than manganese,‘ ‘
frankincense, or~~
several of many other eye-brow .

shades.

However, there is one thing that ’

the Romans didn’t have on the mod-
ern girl: none of them were blondes
at the ﬁrst clip. In the days of the
Romans it was very difficult to be-
come  blorde——except by birth—-
and a Roman girl just couldn’t get
blonde bail‘ with one clip in a dye
as can the modern girl.

Intramural Sports
Beach 3 Milestone

When the inter-league playoffs are concluded

next Week, the winter intramural program will be
over. But m.ore important than tl1e playing of the
final games and the det'crmining of championships
is the fact that the University will have completed
another phase in its “athletics for all” drive.

The signiﬁcance of this will probably be un-
noticed by freslunen and sophomores at the Uni-
versity, for it was only last year that intramural
athletics were placed under the supervision of the
athletic department and an effort was made to
give all men students a chance to participate.

But juniors and seniors will remember the
“good old days” when intramural athletics and
interfraternity athletics were synonymous. The
old system, with intramurals nominally under the
supervision of the physical education department,
satisﬁed the fraternities, because they could make
their own schedules and run their own league
much as they pleased.

A But the great majority of students, who con-
ﬁned their exercise to watching the football or
basketball team, saw no merits in the plan. No
effort was made toorganize or encourage non-
fraternity teams, and the boys were in effect ex-
cluded from such activity.

\’V.i.tl1 the creation of an intramural office and
the appointment of James Potts as intramural di-
rector, opportunities that had never existed be-

fore for st'u.dent participation in athletics were de- '

veloped. The full facilities of the athletic depart-

ment were put to use:and_ intramurals began to

expand. L

Naturally, the program has ‘run into snags.
The “full ‘facilities of-the athletic department”
have proved far from adequate, and many of the
friatieririities have objected to the sudden curtail-
merit of their “freedom.”
plaints have -been justiﬁable, some open to ques-
tion, and some not’ worth considering, but none
have been surprising.

Anything new will be criticized, just as the
proponents of anything new will make mistakes.
Yet, despite the complaints and slip-ups, the in-
‘t"ram11ral- department is headed in the right direc-
tion.’ If there is a_ place at the Universtiy for in-

tramural athletics, and we believe there is, the

men now in charge will put the program across. I

 Pharlnaoy Boys

C One of the ‘newest innovations at Pitt this, year A‘

is the reported ‘campaign down at the Pharmacy
schooil to get recognition in the University student
goyerninent. To our brothers .0n the boulevard
We extend our compliments for their demonstra-
tion of interest in student activities. ' C

We agree with the signers of the petition that
they have the same right to representation as the
other undergraduate schools have. But we ques-
tion what results this right‘ will produce.

An organization like our SFA, competing as it
does with other student government groups that
can hardly do anything on the Oakland campus,
cannot be expected to do much in a building ﬁve
miles down the road.

"It isn’t that we don’t appreciate the ability of
Pharmacy students or the work of SFA members,
but we do recognize the limits of SFA power.

Perhaps our Pharmacy brothers might be able
to concoct some pills that would put life in stu-
dent government here. But even if their head-
quarters were not divorced from Frick Acres, we
know that their drug store work and academic
courses keep them well occupied. So perhaps they
wouldn’t have time to prepare the medicine which
our SFA needs.

A Noble Experiment
Strikes in Snag

To the average University student the news
that l’i.tt Amity Club is reorganizing will be of
little impoi-tance. But to a relatively s-mall group
of non-i’rater11ity students the change in the
standards for Amity Club reflects a partial failure
in ‘a “noble experiment.”

The open membership system, designed to
broaden the acquaintances of non-fraternity stu-
dents, was in theory ideal. But because of the loose
organization resulting from this system, Amity
Club grew weaker, until in the words of i.ts found-
er-,.its reputation became “cheap and unimport-
ant.”

i The aim of Amity Club-—to provide low-cost
social‘ functions for non-fraternity st'udents——-is
neither cheap 11or unimportant. While its new
system of charging dues and restricting member-
ship means that Amity’s original democratic ideal
has been weakened, the founder has explained that
the new organization will assure a more workable
group.

Amity Club started out with an original idea,
and a good one. ‘We hope that it won’t become
simply a social fraternity without a fraternity
house.

Professor-Angler Pens
Literary Fishing Text

By William L. Klinkenstein ,

When a ﬁsherman writes a book on trout ﬁshing,”
you expect that the book will be technical; and when and
F‘-ocl.ish professor writes a book, it is expected that it
will be well written. A ﬁsherman and English pro-
fessor combined work miracles with trout and prose,
and the result is “No Life So_ Happy,” by Edwin L.
Peterson, assistant professor of English.

Expert at the art of trout ﬁshing and ﬂy casting, the
author has written a technical manual of his art with
great literary skill. turning out a book of interest to
the follower of Izaak Walton and to the uninitiated with
rod and reel.

“No life, my honest scholar, no life so havmv and
so pleasant . . .” is a phrase taken from Walton’s
“Comnleet Angler” describing the joys of angling. Mr.
Peterson has done a ﬁne job of proving this point to the
reader. for his narrative and description merge to pre-
sent a beautiful picture of the ﬁsherman’s pleasures.

The original purpose of the book was to teach the
kw-wks of fly casting to the general run of anglers, but
stories of ﬁsh and ﬁshermen became so entwined with
the exposition that it was rewritten into its present
form. One critic has stated that “it has a wealth of
instruction hidden under anecdote.”

Appearing here and there throughout the book is
the heroine. an attractive young girl with a super-
natural control over the beings of the forest. “Elaine
the fair, Elaine the lovable . . .” is this crontiire of
rbnntnsv who enters and leaves the scene from time
to time. departing ﬁnally from the hero with a promise
to return in seven years.

Daughter of a great professor who came to the
forest when the universities limited his actions and
writings, Elaine displays extraordinary skill in casting.
F‘inall.v. she shows the ﬁsherman a legendary brook
trout. “King.” Weighing ten pounds. Few have ever
seen this monster of the stream, and once seen, King is
never foiwzotten.

While in a reﬂective mood, the author discusses Izaak
Walton and Dame Juliana Berne-rs, the father and
mother of modern ﬁshing. Dame .Tuliana’s “Treatyse of
Fvsshynge with an Angle” is a ﬁt'toenth—cPnt11I‘V Work
on the level of the “Comoleat Angler.” and it is to these
two writers that modern ﬁshing owes its development,

President of Alumni
Requests Graduates
To Back Organization

Explaining the procedure for
election of 13 alumni representa-
tives to the University Board of

Trustees, John B. Nicklas, Jr., ’22,
president of the General Alumni
Association, calls upon alumni, in
his column in the Alumni Review,
to support their organization.

In brief, the election is conducted
as follows:.52 alumni will be nom-
inated by the executive committee
of alumni council in the ﬁrst week
of March, and from all names sub-
mitted, the council will place 26 on
the ballot distributed to all mem-
bers in good standing of the ‘as-
sociation on April 15.

Vote for Trustees

Biographical sketches of the can-
didates will be inserted in the
Alumni Review, and blank spaces
on the ballot will allow for write-
in candidates, the article states.

“This is your opportunity to se-
lect alumni. trustees of your choice
for your University,” Mr. Nicklas
declares. “It is the duty of every
Pitt alumnus to belong to the Alum-
ni Association. It is your duty and
privilege to vote.”

With a plea for additional con-
tributions to the association from
alumni. Mr. Nicklas discusses the

Alumni‘ “giving 'plan” instituted 

again this year to make the associa-
tion self-supporting. ' ..

“Campus Conscious”

»“No subsidy has beenlreceived
from the.University as in previous
years, and I am happy toreport that
the budget requirements for the
operation of the alumni office and
the activities of the Association for
this year have been, met,” he de-
clares. ”

R Roy C. McKenna, an alumni
trustee heads the drive for contri-
butions. Average donation to the
fund has been $40, he states. and
an additional amount is needed to
carry the alumni, ofﬁce through the
summer months. 4

Characterizing the aim of the as-

sociation to getthe alumni ‘‘camp- I‘:
us conscious,” Mr.“ Nicklas writes’ of’

the plans for_the annual Charter
Day celebration, scheduled for
March 1 at the Foster ,Memorial.

SFA cards during the registration
period at the beginning of the se-
mesters.

Following this registration, a
special election might have to be
called, Cusick said. Purpose of
this move, he explained, would be
to determine whether a majority
of them preferred’ to belong to the
association. This stipulation is out-
lined in article three of the con-
stitution of SFA.

“The main difficulty of the whole
situation, as I see it,” Cusick said,
‘‘is to secure a complete registra-
tion of the entire undergraduate
student body of the School of Phar-
maCy- At registration time this is
a relatively easy thing to do, but
in the middle of a semester it
might produce complications.”

Carnegie Tech Five  

Seeks Revenge Win

Over Pitt Tomorrow
Stark, Straloski Lead Unpredictable

Squads in Battle on Tartan Court
By Phil Lynch
Carnegie Tech plays host to their Oakland rivals, the fast

breaking Pitt Panther basketball team, tomorrow evening when
the Tartans seek revenge for their recent 73-42 drubbing at the

hands of the Blue a11d Gold.

This will be the second meeting of the two teams this year. In
the ﬁrst encounter, Pitt’s sharpshooter Eddie Straloski pounded

the hoop for 32 points, seven points
higher than the mark set by “Chip-
Per” Charley Hyatt and established
the new school record.

The Tartans are reinforced by the
services of Randall Burch, star point
getter who was hampered by in-
juries for a large part "of the sea-
son. Pitt, on the other hand, may
be handicapped by the ineligibility
of “Ripper” Collins and Jimmy
Egan. '

Jack Scherer, blond senior from
Glassport, has been reinstated and
is eligible to compete for the, rest
of the season. The Panthers are
left with a compact squad of eleven
men out of{ the original ﬁfteen.
Tech Pointing ‘ '

Tech _has been looking forward to
the ‘meeting ‘with. the Carlsonmen
on _thetSkibo' court. Their defeat
at the hands of the Pitt team was
the worst suffered in the 33 year
rivalry of the two schools. Only "
once ‘had Tech been near suchla
lacing ,in 1928, in the days of Char-
leyf, Hyatt. H l ‘ A

Polar Bears Defeat
Seals; Snowflakes
Trounce Defrosters

The Coldspots, though idle last
Tuesday, took undisputed pos-
session of ﬁrst place in the fresh-
man Polar league as the other two
first place teams, the Seals and the
Defrosters, both were beaten.

Action Tuesday saw the Polar
Bears defeat the Seals in a close
game, 38-37, and the Snowﬂakes
swamp the Defrosters, 45-27.

In the ﬁrst game the Seals neg-
lected to freeze the ball with a
three—point lead in the last minute
of play and _allowed the Polar Bears

to win by ‘one point with a ﬁnal ‘

minute rally. .

Paul Lohmeyer sank shots from
all parts of the floor to garner a to-
tal of 17 points for high scoring
honors. Leonard had 10 points and
DelVecchio nine while ‘Silverman
played a nice game defensively for
the winners.

Hennan ‘and Guy each had 10
points for the Seals, although Mas-
ton, with seven. points, dominated
his team’s play. .,

In the second game the Snow-
ﬂakes ﬁnally came out of their leth-
argy andadministered a severe lac-
ing to the Defrosters. The absence
of Malarkey, Defrosters’ captain,

probably had much to do with their .
‘poor showing. ~ '

Presence of Indiana, Purdue

Features 194:1-42 Grid Schedule

The University of Pittsburgh’s
football team will play eight games
in both 1941 and 1942, director of
athletic publicity Frank Carver an-
nounced today.

Six of the 1942 battles will be
at the Stadium, but only four
home contests are carded the fol-
lowing year. ,

Two Big Ten elevens appear on
the Pitt schedule for the ﬁrst time.
Purdue opens the season at the
Stadium in 1941 on October 4, and
Indiana opposes the Panthers here
in the third game of the 1942 sea-
son. ’

Minnesota returns as a Pitt oppo-
nent for the ﬁrst time since 1934,
the year the Gophers were national
champions. In 1941 Charley Bowser
takes his boys to Minneapolis on
October 18, then returns there in
1942 for the September 28 opener.

Southern Methodist, a 1940 op-
ponent, drops off the list until 1942,
when the Mustangs invade the Sta-
dium on October 3.

The bitter Pitt-Fordham series
ends after the 1941 engagement with
little chance that it will be resumed.
Teams which appear on both sched-
ules, besides Minnesota, are Duke,
Ohio State, Carnegie Tech, Nebras-
ka, and Penn State. A

The 1941 card has Purdue in the
opener, an open "date October 11,

employment.

The student employment agency places on the average of 35 students

a month in part-time positions, and
in exceptionally busy months like
December, 1939, takes care of over
100 applicants. ,

Mr. Warwick explained that stu-
dents who are interested in taking
part-time employment other than
NYA work may get in contact
with his ‘service through the Pitt
News,,the advice of his friends, or
notices on University bulletin
boards.

Careful Interviews

When a student contacts Mr. War-
wick’s office, he is ask,-je,d,to fill in
the usual sort of application card
indicating his campus {activities and
the sort of work in which he is in-
terested. He is carefully interview-
ed by the bureau workers who en-
deavor to become acquainted with
the individual personalities of the
boys so that the bureau can de-
terminewhat sort of work each stu-
dent is especially capable of doing.

Although the University has made
no attempt to advertise the bu-
reau’s services to district ‘employ-
ers, calls are sent to the University
every day for student. workers.

N. Y. Herald Advertising Head Cites

Newspaper’s Value to

R. E. ROBINSON

Retail Business

Increasing importance of news-
papers to retail business was cited
by R. E. Robinson, advertising di-
rector of the New York Herald-

Tribune, as helpful for interpreting
consumer buying habits. He spoke
before students of the Research Bu-
reau for Retail Training on Wed-
nesday.

“More than ever before,” said
Mr. Robinson, “retailers are using
advertising as a guide to buying.”

Commenting upon the bureau,
Mr. Robinson declared that the
method used is very practical. He
expectsthat newspapers in the flb
ture will employ graduates of retail
schools to a greaterextent than be-
fore, and that-there will be a closer
relationship between the schools and
newspapers.

In addition to the reg'u.larteach-
ing staff of the Bureau, many au-
thorities like Mr. Robinson’ give
talks to the students during the
year on‘ fields relatedto retailing.

‘Please mention .

"rt-1:: 1=rr'r NEWS

when answering advertisements

These calls are then immediately
referred to Mr. Warwick. He con-
tacts the men whose applications
fit into the employer’s requirements
through the marshals, if the pros-
pect is in class, or by phoning the
student’s residence.

‘Picky’ Men Avoided

Business ‘men are usually very
specific when they ask for appli-
cants, indicating whether the man
shall be a freshman or a senior, a
blond or a brunette, a minor or ‘of
age. Fintex storesask for pre-law
students; hospitals, for pre-meds;
McCann’s, for ten applicants from
which to chose one or two. The
positions to be ﬁlled range from
steadyrsales jobs to a Chinese valet
to impress company——and Mr. War-
wick says he can ﬁll them all.

The Student Placement Bureau
keeps in close touch with students
who are working at positions under
their guidance, and requires that
they report the exact-amount of
money they earn. About half of the
men on the bureau’s waiting list will
make the mistake of being “picky”
about the jobs offered and the di-
rectors assure us that those men’ are
forgotten when something big comes
along.

Mr. Warwick remarked that this
year of 1939-1940 has already far
surpassed the placement record of
other years, but that the part-time
student employment waiting list is
still longer than they can handle.

MORE MILDNESS, COOLNESS,

“ PEED’S ﬁne in hockey but not in cigarettes”—Roy,

how right you are!

Research men may use fancier language—but they
say exactly the same thing about cigarettes.
Scientists know that nothing destroys a cigarette’s
delicate elements of fragrance and ﬂavor so merci-
lessly as—exce:s /seat. And cigarettes that burn fast
also burn bot. Your own taste tells you that.
Slow-burning cigarettes don’t burn away these
precious natural elements of ﬂavor and fragrance.
They're milder, mellower, and—naturally—cooler!
And the slowest-burning cigarette of the 16 larg-
est-selling brands tested was Camel.’ They burned
25% slower than the average of the 15 other of the
largest-selling brands tested. (See panel below, right.)
So...why not enjoy Camel’s extra mildness, cool-
ness, fragrance, and ﬂavor? . . .And extra smoking
equal; to 5 extra smokes per pack.

IN THIS ACTION SI-IOT he's come in like a bullet from an express riﬂe...
he takes" a pass. But the opposition’s defense stops him—this time.
