Change ln Fitzgeraldis Title
Explained By Dr. Bowman

Chancellor John G. Bowman an-
nounced today that changing Rufus
H. Fitzgerald’s title from Provost
to Vice-Chancellor only was made
for clarity of position and that no

additional duties accompanied the.

new name. His title was changed
last week.

“Mr. Fitzgerald’s title was chang-
from Provost to Vice-Chancellor to
clarify his position,” Dr. Bowman
said. “Too many persons have ask-

. ed me. ‘just what is. a Provost?”

“There has been no change in
his work or anything else . . . just
in the wording of his position,"
the Chancellor said during an in-
terview last Friday. .

The Board of Trustees, who an-
nounced the change of title last
Tlmrsday, acted at the suggestion
of Mr. Bowman, who then said that
“the title of ‘Provost’ is, in many
instances, not understood . . . Mr.
Fitzgerald has been, in effect, Vice-
Chancellor of the University for
four years.”

During the interview, the Chan-
cellor was asked if he intended ‘to
retire. Although he would not is-
sue a statement for publication, he
indicated that he had no intention
of leaving Pitt, discrediting rumors
that the new‘ name for the Provost
was a public indication that he
would retire to recommend Mr.
Fitzgerald for the chancellorship.

The Chancellor explained that
the names “Chancellor” and “Pro-
vost” were ﬁrst used in the English
monastic system. Oxford and Cam-
bridge, he said, used the name
“Chancellor” as an honorary po-
sition with the vice-chancellor do-
ing most of the work.

Mr. Fitzgerald, who came to the
University in 1938, is chairman of
the Board of Deans. He also advis-
es the deans with regard to budgets
and on the general educational
policy of the University.

He also is chairman of the Uni-
Iersity Senate, a group of 140 ad-
'ministrative and faculty members
serving as an advisory body to

" the administration and as a link

between faculty and oﬁicers of the
University. Dr. Bowman is exofﬁcio
president of the Senate.

SFA Executive Groups
Choose Committee Heads

B7 ABE BLUESTONE

Old and new SFA executive committees, meeting Thursday noon at
the University club, in.a session ending in bittercharges and counter-
charges, picked committee chairmen and the complete appointments

committee for this year.

As chairman of the powerful appointments committee, the group

placed Phi Ep Alex Zelenski, C43.

Chosen as committeemen were Len Wolk, Pi Lambda Phi; Charles

Cusick, Phi Kappa; George Har-
tenstein, Independent; Al Minno,

Ed Byers, Independent, will head

Independent, Scholar’s day; .Her-
bert Gall, Independent, Battleship
Drivie; and James Plunkett, Phi
Delta Theta, Constitutional Revi-
sion committees.. '

Independent leaders claimed that
these appointments should not be
ﬁnal since the old executive com-
mittee was dllowed to vote. When
this claim was raised‘ at the be-
ginning of the meeting, it was ar-
gued that old members be'permit-
ted to vote because’ of the tradi-
tional right they exercise. The In-
dependents continued to balk,
claiming that the “right” was un-
constitutional.

A vote was taken, resulting in a
three-to-three tie. Assistant Dean
of Men Roy Umble, inﬂuenced by
the tradition, by——as former SFA
president Ed Tait put it—the cour-
tesy of extending the right, and by

Goocl Layouts,

But Brosky does present some ﬁne layouts-—th'c
one on the Pitt Band, the military pages, the publi-
cations spread-—these highlight a yearbook contain-
ing some of the ﬁnest picture arrangements in our

recollection.

Excellent, in most cases, are the photographs.
There is a naturalness to the pictures in the book
that speaks well for the efforts of head phdtographer,
managing editor Stan Barish and his crew.

The colors in the book are good, but in his cap-
tions of pictures, Brosky might well have used actu-
al type, rather than trying to imitate type faces.
Particularly glaring is this fault on the inside title
page of the book—-where the lettering done by Owl
artists lacks professional neatness.

But despite these flaws, the Owl is good. It's good
because it has a campus coverage far wider than any

Weak Writing, Features of 1942 Owl 

This year's Owl, Editor John Brosky’s “hand-in-~

rounding a couple of lines of type.

There's a. section for ‘the freshmen, for sopho-
mores,‘ for juniors. There's a space devoted to’ select-- 
ing ideal traits for Pitt coeds, a section for publica-;
tions, fraternities, organizations, athletics, dances-——
putting into the book more pictures of more people ‘
than ever before. 
No such thing as one person’s picture appearing ‘ i

are ﬁne pictorial representations of what they pur-

Weakest of all in this year's book is the writing.”
Cut lines accompanying most of the pictures are
weak, in most cases undescriptive. Organization.
write-ups show little ‘originality, a lack‘ of knowledgu‘

Proving once again that (1) pitching -is 75 per cent of
baseball, and (2) there is no substitute for a base hit, the

Panthers supplied plentyof both and gained their first win
of the season, an'8-5 triumph over Indiana',State Teachers
College at the Stadium on Saturday. _

It was really two pitchers who turnedthe trick for the

scattered hits, and ﬁve runs, only

~ three of which were earned, and

struck out ten batters doing it, and

ex-pitcher J-oe Wilk,

playing left‘ ﬁeld.
Pitcher Wilk left much to be de-

~ 1* game, but outﬁelder Wilk was just

  

- sired last week in the Bucknell
S?about perfect. He checked in with

four of the ten Panther hits, drove
in a run, and set up the run in the
first iinninghwith a perfect bunt
along the third base line. Ed Fish-
er and Gene Zukas contributed"

two hits apiece,‘and Fred Wilner’

and Bill McKee collected the other

1

two‘.

V0 Indiana got off to an early lead

 

,,.goi;i_e3.7;through the entire

in the first inning, scoring two runs.
However, only one of these was
earned. But the Panthers came
right back in-their ‘half to score
one run on a pair of’ walks, an in-
“ﬁeld single and an inﬁeld out." They
might ‘well have scored more had it
not been for a weird double play
that would have done credit to the
Dodgers inthe dizzy days when
Babe Herman was busy stealing

bases t that were already -occupied

by his teammates. ’

currently

The bases’ were _loaded ’when
Fred Wilner sent one back to the
third baseman whoipromptlytossed
to the plate "to nail Kostenbauderi
attempting to score. ‘' Whereupon
Joe Wilk, who had started to third
suddenly‘ decided to go back to
second, andbefore you could say
“but ‘Johnny iBrown~ is already
there,” he was out from the catch-
er to the shortstop.

The Panthers went ahead in their L

half of the third when they picked
up three runs on just one hit; Wilk
opened the inning with a single to
left.‘ Brown was safe when the
shortstop fumbled his grounder
and Wilk went on to second. Vaik-_
snor struck out, but when the left-
fielde13mufl"ed Wilner’s ﬂy for a
two base error, Wilk and Bro_wn
scored. , P ,

Statistics,” a compilation and in-
terpretation of crime data.

Another survey for which Dr.
Lunden received wide notice was
~ his successful attempt to ﬁnd a cor-
5 {relation between the business cycle

nd the murder-suicide rates. Com-
pleted last year, Dr. Lunden’s re-
lts have already been published
in several sociology books. and
ve attracted considerable atten-
on to the University sociologist.
‘ Other books published by Dr.
Lunden include, “A Systematic
Qutline of Criminology,” and “Ju-
Nenile Delinquency.” '

Dr. Lunden graduated from Gus-
tavus Adolphug, the college he will
soon head, in 1922, after serving
as a pilot in the army air corps
during the last war.

I_ He later received graduate de-
 grees from Northwestern Theolog-

ical seminary, the University of
E Minnesota, and Harvard Univers-
P It was while studying at Harv-
 that Dr. Lunden met, and be-
came friends with Pitirime A. Soro-
n, contemporary top-ranking rur-
sociologist.
,  Lunden is a member of the
vPennsylvania Prison society and
the Pennsylvania Committee on
Penal Affairs. He also holds mem-
bership in Alpha Kappa Delta, hon.
torary sociology fraternity.

They claim that the juggling of the

To Compile List
Of Service Men

Universit Editor  p 

All Pitt men who expect to go ‘

into the armed services are asked

-to ﬁle their ‘names and camp ad-

dresses with “Service Records,”
University Editor’s oﬂ‘ice, 2309 Ca-
thedral, in order that a complete
record of Pi_tt men in service ma}?
be obtained. a
This ﬁle of names is not a com-
monvrecord such as grades in the,

‘if

Registrar’s office, but is a “hu- 

man attempt for the remembrance

of those who are doing an outstand-

ing job,” according to William
Morrell, University editor.

“Service Records” will be-lbasé

of communications for Pitt men in

the service, and will offer a como , <

plete and up-to-date list froimi
which friends will be able to get
in touch with those who are serv-
ing their country. . “ I

Up to‘ the present time, Mr. Mor-

rell has conducted the work of mak-
ing the list with the help of his

two secretaries, but in the future

a student-faculty group may be
organized to keep in active contact
with the service men. ‘

The records, which were started

in September, 1940, have to date
listed over 1,200 Pitt men. _ .
