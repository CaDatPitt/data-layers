Charges
against
Moyer I
dropped

By Frances Sansig
Managing Editor

Charges have been dropped
against Student Government
Board president Phil Moyer alleg-
ing that he had - taken action
without Board approval, accord-
ing to Ron Miletta, chairperson of
the Judicial Committee.

”We’ve decided a hearing isn't
necessary,” said_Miletta. ”The Ju-
dicial Committee seriously con-

sidered the charges filed  and
‘ we questioned the proper

people.”

.Miletta said by a ‘unanimous
vote of the seven committee
members in attendance (out of a
possible nine), the charges were
dropped because the items Moy-
er was charged with had been
corrected.

Charges were filed against him

.by Board members Therese

McFadden and Melanie Naro
claiming that he proceeded to ap-
prove an item of allocations bus-
iness without mandatory approval
of the remainder of the SGB. ”Re-
cently, this trust [in presidential
duties] in me has been ques-
tioned by two members of the
SGB,” said Moyer.

The item involved approval of
$866.48 for the Engineering Stu-
dent Cabinet to attend a leader-
ship conference.

Moyer said it was imperative

the ESC receive a verdict on the
allocations request as soon as

' possible, but he had only been

able to contact two Board mem-
bers by the time a final decision
had to be made on the matter, so
he approved the business
himself.

”I felt it was done in the interest
of student activities.  I made the
decision and still stand by it,” he
said.

The item was presented to the
Board and was approved.

Moyer also stepped down as a
member of the Allocations Selec-
tion Committee. ’’I felt there was
too much controversy surround-
ing it,” said Moyer after the
weekly meeting of the SGB last
night.

In other SGB business, Board
member George Kontos reported
that the student taxi service use
has increased by 100 percent.
The average riders per night on

A .weekdays is 35 and is even great-A

”The spectrum of people affect-

ed by AIDS runs from healthy I

people who carry the virus to
folks who are very, very ill and
will soon die. What these people
have in common is that they have

in Allegheny County,” said
Clemente last night.

According to Clemente, sexu-
ally active homosexual and bisex-
ual men who have multiple sex
partners account for 70 percent of
male AIDS cases, and 66 percent
of all AIDS cases. Seven percent
of the cases occur in homosexu-
al or bisexual men who are in-
travenous drug users.

Heterosexual men who are
present or past IV drug users
make up 17 percent of AIDS
cases. Heterosexual partners of
someone with AIDS or at risk for
AIDS account for ,4 percent of

_AIDS cases.

”Those who have received a
blood transfusion or or blood

Clemente said that although
there are no known cases of AIDS

enter the cells of the body
through cuts in the mouth.‘
”Men who have oral sex with
a woman and come in contact
with menstrual blood are
definitely running a risk,” said
Clemente. ' ’
”Anal sex is not risky per se; it's
anal sex with an infected person
that's definitely dangerous. Trau-

gives the virus easy access to

tear in the rectum could get into

Saliva contaminated with

According to Clemente, ”The
best precaution is to quit having
sex, but, of course, that is com-

sary. You and your partner
should both get blood tests. Once
proven safe, then do what you
want. If you don't know the part-

had sex with a bisexual man or
prostitute, or uses IV drugs),
either avoid sex or use protec-

Amnesty  

groups
organize
members

By Mike Evanish 

For The Pitt News

A training seminar for local .
Amnesty International members, "
sponsored by Pittsburgh Amnesty .

Group 39, was held in Pittsburgh
last weekend to discuss future is-

sues and organize membership. “

Amnesty International defines
itself as a volunteer organization‘
working for the release, of
”prisoners of conscience,” or

those imprisoned for their beliefs .

rather than because of criminal

"activity.

Amnesty International’s mid- 

Atlantic director, James O’Dea,

along with three members of his ,

staff, led the five—hour session

held at the downtown YMCA.
The focus of the event was a

special training session for stu-

dents on organizing. Amnesty 

Campus Chapters, with emphasis
on correct procedures to follow
in order to attain sanctioning of
the chapter by Amnesty Interna-

tional.

Mary Tidlow, a Pitt junior, said»
she plans to establish a Pitt ‘Am-
nesty chapter by January, 1988.

”My aim is to get the Universi-
.. ty of Pittsburgh involved in Am-
nesty International,” said Tidlow.
”Students have enough time to '

contribute to such a cause.”

Amnesty groups recently at-

tended a concert held in Pitts-.

burgh by the rock grdup U2 and
collected signatures for the
release of Serge Belov, a prisoner
in a Soviet psychiatric hospital.

”The U2 concert was a tremen-
dous boost,” said Dorothy Miller,

Pittsburgh Amnesty Group 394  I

publicity chairman. ”We were
enormously pleased with the
response.”

Geraldine Malmberg, chairper-

son of Saturday's seminar, said .

she was optimistic concerning fu-
ture Amnesty activities.

”Hopefully, it [the seminar] «

was the beginning of a surge of
interest,” she said. ”We are look-
ing forward to -increased activity
and to ‘seeing more Amnesty
chapters on campus.” ‘

"I'[would] like to arrange for’

some speakers to come in [to Pitt]

who actually were prisoners of I

conscience,” Tidlow said. ”They
can" be very inspirationaI.f’ _ .

MANAMA, Bahrain — Iran said
Iraqi warplanes bombed an un-
finished nuclear power plant in
southern Iran Tuesday, killing 11

9 workers, including a West Ger-

man engineer.

Baghdad said its jets hit a near-
by plant that it hinted was mak-
ing and storing chemical
weapons, and its forces crushed

. an overnight ground attack on the

central front.

Tehran radio said that among
the dead in the strike on the
nuclear facility were ”one of the
plant's top nuclear power ex-
perts” and a West German en-
gineer. ’

Swedish train wreck

kills 11; injures 100
GOTEBORC, Sweden —— Two

express trains collided head-on

while speeding past a suburban
station Tuesday, killing nine peo-

ple and injuring more than 100,
Swedish television said.

Both engines and a passenger
car caught fire and some pas-
sengers were trapped in the
wreckage for hours, according to

' the reports. They said the death

toll might grow as wrecked cars
were cut open.
The drivers of the two trains
were among the victims.
Thomas Sundback witnessed
the scene at Lerum station, six
miles east of this western port
city, and said on Swedish televi-
sion: ’’It was dreadful.  There
was blood everywhere.”
Another witness said when he
heard the collision, his first
thought was that Lerum’s gaso-
line station "blew up. .
Neither train was scheduled to
stop at Lerum, and one conduc-
tor said his train was going about
60 mph, Swedish radio reported.

vestigated by the state, following
a hospital lawsuit seeking pay-
ment, and reports that she kept
part of the money, Florida's secre-
tary of state said Tuesday.

Maria DeSillers, whose 7-year-
old son Ronnie died in April
while awaiting a fourth trans-
plant, is under investigation for
possible violations of Florida
charity regulations, said Secretary
of State Jim Smith.

DeSillers, 31, refused to com-
ment on the investigation, buther
attorney, Stanley Rosenblatt, said
it was only a result of the exten-
sive-publicity she has received.

’’I believe ultimately the inves-
tigation will reveal no wrong-
doing on the part of Maria
DeSil|ers,” Rosenblatt said.

Children's Hospital of Pitts-
burgh, where Ronnie underwent
the transplant, has filed suit
against DeSillers for $260,000

left unpaid of a $424,302 bill.

DeSillers has said she has only
$196,000 left of the money do-
nated, which included $1,000
from President Reagan, after pay-
ing the hospital an initial deposit
of $162,000.

She announced last week she
was witholding payment from the
hospital because of concerns
about the accuracy of the bill and
the quality of the last organ Ron-
nie received. '

An aeronautics professor who

ice buildup should be considered
a prime suspect in the crash,
which killed 27 of the 82 people
aboard.

A"'spokesman for federal inves-

THE PI'lT NEWS, Wednesday, November I8, 1987

G rou p ke
By Theresa Costello
Staff Writer

Twice a month in the area
around Verona, Pa., the Society
for Creative Anachronism meets
to test their prowess in knightly
combat. The SCA is a group that
has been in existence across the
United States and throughout Eu-

‘ rope for 50 years. .

”We in the East Kingdom com-
pose Virginia, Pennsylvania, New
York and all over the East coast
plus Sweden, West Germany and
the United Kingdom,” said Lord
Sugitori Yamamota also known as
Victor Wrobleski, a Pitt student
and seven-year veteran of SCA.

There are also the Middle and
West Kingdoms which include
the rest of the United States.
These kingdoms have been in ex-
istence anywhere from 22 years

-to over 50 years.
Wrobleski said that there are

volved and more from Carnegie
Mellon and Chatham College.
”This isn't just for college stu-
dents, however,” added
Wrobleski. ”There are a lot of

older people in the chapter.”

‘ 

The idea of fighting is
not to injure the other
fighter 

— Victor Wrobleski

The tournaments that the group
participate in are battles that at-
tempt to recreate the contest be-
tween knights and warriors from
the Middle Ages. Although the
swords are not the real thing (they
resemble taped hockey sticks), ar-
mor is still worn and injuries do
occur -

”The idea of fighting is not to
injure the other fighter but to see
if you have the strategy and skill
to win,” said Wrobleski. He said,
however, that he once broke
another warrior’s finger.

”She was real nice about it,
though. We took her right to the
hospital. Any injuries are rare,
although bruises are expected.
We have about one person hurt
every three years, which is good,
considering we fight almost every
weekend,” he added.

The combat system is based on
the honor code. Being hit in the
head or torso constitutes death
while above the wrist or above
the knee results in loss of that
limb.

SCA’s activities touch almost
every aspect of medieval life, not
only fighting. There are weekly
workshops in weaving, calligra-
phy, armor making, jewelry and
leather work, heraldry, archery

KIOSK magazine provides
an outlet for local writers

By . Greg Keklak

Staff Writer

New writers often have
difficulty getting their work pub-
lished. Many literary journals are
only interested in limited areas of
writing and are very selective.
New writers _in the Pittsburgh
area, however, have an outlet for
their work. .

KIOSK is a Pittsburgh-based
literary magazine which features
poetry, short fiction and sketches
by local writers and artists. The
main purpose of the magazine,
according to Steven Seel, co-

editor and co-publisher, is to ”ac-
curately reflect the Pittsburgh
literary scene.” He said that the
magazine was started as a forum
for new writers and as a way to
get his friends’ works published.

KIOSK was first published in
February of this year, in which
the initial run of 100 issues was
sold out in the first week of sales.

Production responsibilities for
KIOSK are also handled by
Charles Ward and Adam Ward.

Seel said the magazine is or-
ganized according to ”a

democratic approach” to provide

a fair representation of ideas. .

He added the positive response
that KIOSK has received can be
attributed to word of mouth and
the popularity of Tuesday night
readings of literary works at
Hemingway's Cafe.

Seel went on to say that sub-
mission of works by non-local

A writers has created a problem for

the magazine. He said that the
magazine is a ”forum for all,” but
”growth breeds selectivity” and
that the goal of KIOSK is to ”ex-
pand but not exclude."

According to Seel, the writers
for KIOSK are ”average people
who like to write.”

Every month SCA meets for a
special barony meeting. Pitts-
burgh and the immediate area
constitute one barony with the ti-
tle of ”Barony Marche of Debat-
able Lands” because the area has
been alternately conquered by
the East and Middle Kingdoms.

Feasts and fairs are also a
favorite among the SCA. Michael
Rusnock, referred to as Colins,
also a Pitt student, attended last
year's Viking Winter Finding Fes-
tival, a midwinter celebration.

’’I got a chance to see a lot of
people I had just met since I be-
gan and to see the different
costumes and armor,” said Rus-
nock. ’’It was my first chance to

eps the medieval world alive at Pitt

_ approximately 25 Pitt students in-

see a real set of chain mail.’’ I

Wrobleski stressed the fact that
authenticity is a large part of their
organization, which focuses on
the period between 600 A.D. to
1650 A.D.

”Everything has to be as histor-
ically accurate or at least as much
as the rules will allow.”

New members are always wel-

comed into the group and are ad- . I

dressed as lord and lady out of
respect, even before the titles are
officially earned.

Women journalists
not afraid of war

RADNOR, Pa. — War cor-
respondents, those daredevil
danger junkies who_ love to cover
conflict on the front lines, have
always been towering figures in
the romantic mythology of jour-
nalism.

But, until recently, they have
been almost exclusively male.

That's changing as ABC, CBS
and NBC send more women
reporters, producers and crew
members to the battle zones, ac-
cording to the Nov. 21 edition of
TV Guide magazine.

Not only are they taking their
places alongside men, they are
acquiring a reputation among
their colleagues for being among
the most courageous of jour-
nalists on the battlegrounds, the
magazine reported.

”Women are tending to be
more aggressive in general, tak-
ing up that drive to go anywhere
and do anything,” said Dan
Brown, chief of NBC’s Miami
bureau.

The go-get-’em attitude has
much to do with the fact that
many of the women are young
and still trying to build their repu-
tations, while their male col-
leagues are often older and more

battle-weary. But it also has to do
with women having to go the ex-
tra mile to win credibility.

’’I didn't want to be just
another blonde on television,”
said Bonnie Anderson, a former
NBC correspondent in Beirut and
El Salvador..”l wanted respect,
and I wanted people to treat me.
with integrity, to know that l was
going to carry my weight in any
situation.”

Many women, such as CBS’
Jane Wallace, had to fight for
their assignments. Wallace cam-
paigned for more than a year with
the network before getting her
”marching orders" from Dan
Rather, Hill wrote.

Once in the field, women often '
have to overcome resistance from '

co—workers. Anne Garrels, who
covered El Salvador for ABC in

1983 and 1984, had to prove to V

her Latin crew that she ”wasn't
some little debutante from New
York who was_sudden|y going to
turn around with tears in her eyes
and say, ’I can't go on.’ ” She
made sure she took the same risks
as her crew, and at the end of her
tour, the apologetic group toast-
ed her performance.

Convicted In Slaying

By Carl Hilliard

Associated Press Writer

DENVER (AP) - A federal jury _

convicted two members of the
neo—Nazi group The Order and
acquitted two others‘Tuesday of
civil rights violations in the 1984
machine-gun slaying ofJewish ra-
dio talk show host Alan Berg.

The jury deliberated more than
10 hours over two days before
returning the verdict.

The jury found that David Lane
and Bruce Pierce killed Berg,. an
outspoken and sometimes abra-
sive radio personality, because he

jwas Jewish and employed as a
talk show host. There was no ap-
plicable murder statute under fed-
eral law.

Richard Scutari and Jean Craig
were acquitted. ' ,

Lane and Pierce could receive
up to life in prison, becoming
eligible for parole after 10 years.

’’I’m 50 percent happy,” Assis-

tant U.S. Attorney Barry Kowa|-

of Talk—Show Host

ski said after the verdict, which
came after more than two weeks
of testimony from nearly 100 wit-
nesses.

The case against the four was
based on circumstantial evi-
dence, provided mainly by form-
er members of The Order who
agreed to testify in exchange for
reduced sentences.

Berg, 50, was gunned down
the "night ofJune 18, 1984 in the
driveway of his Denver town-
house, hit by T3 bullets from a
silencer—eq‘uipped_ .45-caliber
machine pistol. '

”They killed him because of his
job and they did it because he
was a Jew,” Thomas O'Rourke,
an assistant U.S. attorney, had
said in closing arguments.

Defense lawyers noted that
while the four may have held un-
popular, even repulsive views,
they did not kill Berg and the
government had insufficient evi-
dence to prove it.

THE PITT NEWS

These boys bring
some pep to Pitt

By Doug Raynor

-Staff writer -

Marc Reisman used to play the
clarinet, and he hated it. So one
day in his senior. year at Pitt, af-
ter playing a game of racquetball
at Trees Hall, he was more than
happy to take an offer from two
young kids who wanted to sell

him an harmonica. He gave them ,

a few bucks and from there on in,
well  call it an addiction.

He learned to play the blues.
And he learned well. Shortly af-
ter holding a racquetball racket,
Marc was holding an harmonica
up to his mouth as a member of
one of Pittsburgh's most well-
known bands, the Iron City
Houserockers.

That lasted eight years. But af-
ter too many close but unsuccess-
ful leaps toward fame and a lot
of instability ‘— both in the band
itself and in his finances — Marc
decided to call it quits.

”When I left the Houserockers,
I was really burned out/.’ said
Reisman. ’’I never thought I'd
play again. I went on and
managed a few local bands, but
after about two years, that pe-
tered out.” '

From there, it was on to Pitt law
school in hopes of creating a
more secure future. But only af-
ter a year or so of studying, the
desire to play music came back.

”While in school, I taught har-
monica classes at night,” added
Reisman. ”That kept my finger in
music. And as the pressure of

school eased up, I just got the bug
back/’

The result of that bug was the
Pep Boys, which is now one of
Pittsburgh's finest makers of
”grassroots,” rhythm and blues
rock ’n’ roll.

The band —- frontman Reisman
(also vocalist), Ned Rankin
(drummer and also former mem-
ber of the Houserockers), Brook
Duer (bassist and former member
of the Core, a popular reggae
band)‘ and Steve Loevner
(guitarist, formerly of Prowler —
a '70s blues band) are all in this
band for one very simple reason.

”The Pep Boys are doing it
[making music] for the love of it,“
said Reisman. ”We’re not out to
make a career of it. The House-
rockers was a full time job. Now,
it's a lot different.”

Everyone in the ban_d has
another job, so that, of course,
restricts playing time. But accord-
ing to Reisman, things are even
better now. ”We’re all having a
lot more fun now. We love what
we're doing. It's not so much the
money, so we don't play music
we hate. And we don't play in
clubs we hate.”

It's obvious that money is not
this band's No. 1 priority; mak-
ing an impression is important,
Consequently, an album is on the
Pep Boy's agenda.

”There are so many local
bands putting out albums,” Reis-
man commented-. ”So to make a
real impression on Pittsburgh, we

An evening of apparitions?
Let's see. The opening act,
Opal, was not set to support
the Jesus and Mary Chain.
Their no-show might have up-
set those anticipatingsome
happy nightmare sound. But
the local band 11th Hour filled
in, providing a decent set of
guitar-crazed songs, and a
dozen or so people danced.

The break between 11th.
Hour and Jesus and Mary
Chain was a.good long hour.
As the stage was being set, one
couldn't help noticing a huge
absence — no drums. The
sound was compensated by
recorded versions of the sim-
ple rhythms, which really
didn’t go over too badly. In
spite of this let down, the
Chain sound was alive and
well with the continous
screech of jagged feedback.

The band began with ”Heart
and Soul,” proving vocalist
Jim Reid was certainly up to
par with his waning voice.
Bass player Douglas Hart
seemed a bit despondent for
most of the show; he hung his
head down close to his guitar
and didn't bother to look up;
even so, he played well.

On a whole, the Chain’s
performance was quite good,
within their own sytle. It was
loud and noisy, loaded with

lots of fuzz and flat, nearly
monotone vocals.

Obviously displeased with
the spontaneity, a few people
said the band sounded much
better on vinyl than they did
last night. The band was slug-
gish at times, and Reid even
missed one song cue. The
Chain’s set was too brief —— a
quick 50 minutes. The band
played without saying a word,
although Reid did wave good-

> bye as he walked off the stage.

The Jesus and Mary Chain can be aninspiration

Some songs from P5ychocan—
dy sent the energetic Graffiti
crowd into an inspired frenzy «
of slamming and stage diving.
Reid let loose a bit; he
knocked around his mike
stand. The Chain also played
a few tamer tracks off their
latest Darklands album, in-
cluding ”April Skies” and
”Happy When It Rains.” They
closed with their version of
”Who Do You Love,” packed
with the sound of wild electric
guitars.

Lunchtime isshowtime at Studio

Starved for entertainment? Pitt's
Studio Theatre will be presenting
George Bernard Shaw's one-act
comedy, How He Lied to Her

" Husband, at lunchtime. (12:15

p.m.) Wednesday through Friday.
The production marks the revival
of Lunchtime Theatre at the
University of Pittsburgh.

The play, starring Harry Bouvy,
Kellee Van Aken and Steve Sirul-
nick, is about adultery and takes

I a funny, cynical look at Victori-

an morals. The production is
directed by Sean McG|ynn, an
undergraduate at Pitt.
”Underneath, it's comic light-
ness,” he said. ”Shaw has some-

thing important to say about how

romanticism cannot survive in a

' commercial world?’

     

Shaw's play is the first of five
one-acts that will be presented for
the Lunchtime Theatre, in work-
shop form, under the joint
auspices of the theater arts
department and the Student
Government Board.

Adrienne Deriotis, a master's
candidate in theatrical produc-
tion, describes the Lunchtime
Theatre as a way to reach new au-
diences. , '

”We think that there are peo-
ple out there who would like to
get to the ‘theater more often but
can't because of their busy sched-
ules. This way they can enjoy a
play andlunch at the same time,”
she, said.

similar to that of.Jimmy Vaughan
of the Fabulous Thunderbirds.
And Brook's bass chords are
comparable to those of some ear-
ly ZZ Top tunes.
_ Combining all of this, the Pep
Boys display a sound, according
to Reisman, reminiscent of the
Fabulous Thunderbirds with a
twist of John Cougar Mellencamp
— road-house blues blending
with steady rock ’n’ roll. And they
put thisstyle to work with their
own versionsof Wilson Pickett’s
”Mustang Sally” and Van Morri-
son's ”G|oria,” among others.
So far, much of the Pep Boy's
success has come from their
cover single" of B0 Diddley’s
”Roadrunner" and its B-side ver-
sion of Sonny Boy Williamson's
”Bring it on Home.” ”Roadrun-
ner” defines the Pep Boys as
nothing other than a slick,
vibrant, foot stompin’ rock ’n’ roll
blues band.. Not at all complex
but definitely dance worthy. The
song became popularized as it

‘leaped into the WPTS Top 10 in

April of last year. Reisman said
that everybody at the station was
great when it came tosupporting
the band and their hit single.
He went on to say that Pitts-

burgh is an excellent place to -

make music. ‘All kinds. And he's
very happy to be a part of it all.
”A real big milestone for us was
to play in the Pittsburgh Music
Awards,” said Reisman. ’’It was
great to back up all of Pittsburgh's
musicians,” some of which in-
cluded Billy Price, Dub Squad,
the Spuds and Norm Nardini.
Everybody in the Pep Boys has
had their ups and downs. Right
now, though, they're definitely
on ‘the upswing. That's because

they, along with their audiences,"
— are having a great time.

”We’re more excited than ever

now,”- ex”plained Reisman. ”Our__

music is more fun and less ‘blue

’ collar angst’ (like i'n_the House?

rockers). Now we play rock ’n’
roll as more of a celebration.”
(Celebrate with the Pep Boys.
They'll perform tomorrow night
at 8:30 in’ the WPU Assembly
Room. Admission is free.)

Looking back at Penn State one more time

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

Tying up some loose ends from
Pitt's 10-0 shutout over Penn
State last weekend:

0 Head coach Mike Gottfried
still had positive reactions about
the victory, but he was quick to
move his attention to the Kent
State game this Saturday.

”The thing that pleased me the
most was that we found a way to
win the ballgame. The defense
rallied and made key stops —
blocking two field goals.

"You have to give credit to

Penn State. I've never seen that
good of a goal-line defense that

they've shown in the past couple
of. weeks. It was a good win for
us. It's over. We have to turn to
the next game," Gottfried added.

0 As for the injury report,
senior Teryl Austin will not play
Saturday because of a separated
left shoulder. Freshman Louis
Riddick and junior Chris Ross are
listedas doubtful and questiona-
ble, respectively.

P With his 160 yards against
Penn State, Craig Heyward is one
game away from rushing for at
least 100 yards in all 11 regular
season games. If he does it this
weekend, he will join Pitt's Tony
Dorsett, Archie Griffin, Terry

Miller, George Rogers, Marcus

‘return as’ the final game for both

Allen, Hershel Walker and Mike
Rozier.

Heyward also continues to lead
the nation in rushing, averaging
139.6 yards per game. After 10
games, he has 1,396 yards rush-
ing, averaging 4.4 yards per
carry.

9 0 For the first time since 1971

and only the second time since
1957, the Panthers will end their
regular season with a team other
than Penn State. Next season, Pitt

might think that the Panthers are

lays’ George Bell
Wins A.L. M.V.P.

By Jim Donaghy
AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK — George Bell of
the Toronto Blue Jays became the
first member of a Canadian team
to win the American League Most
Valuable Player award Tuesday,
beating Alan Trammell of the
Detroit Tigers in the voting.

Bell, also the first Dominican to
be named MVP, beat the Tigers’
shortstop by 21 points, getting

3 332 points to Trammell’s 311 in

voting by the Baseball Writers As-
sociation of America.

For winning, Bell will receive
a $50,000 bonus from the Blue
Jays. The outfielder’s base salary
for 1987 was $1,285,000.

Two association members in
each of the 14 American League
cities were eligible to vote. Bell
received 16 first-place votes and
Trammell 12. V J

Minnesota outfielder Kirby
Puckett was third in the voting

,with 201 points, followed by

Boston's Dwight Evans and Mil-
waukee's Paul Moiltor. .

Bell's outstanding season was
somewhat tarnished by a damag-
ing slump in the final weeks of
the season as Toronto battled
Detroit for first.place in the AL
East.

Bell struggled through a
2-for-26 finish as the Tigers swept
the Blue Jays in the final three
games to win the division.

Bell, who is not always cooper-
ative with the media, hit .308
with 47 home runs, a league-
leading 134 runs batted in and
111 runs scored, the latter three
setting club records. He also had

a .605 slugging percentage and ‘

16 game-winning RBIs.

He staged a season—long battle
with Oakland rookie Mar-k
McGwire for the AL home-run ti-
tle before McGwire finished with
49.

”He’s got a bad shoulder from
carrying the rest of the ball club
all summer,” Detroit Manager
Sparky Anderson said of Bell af-
ter the Tigers beat the Blue Jays
1-0 on thefinal day of the season.
’ Trammell moved to the No. 4
spot in the lineup during spring
training, after the defection of free
agent Lance Parrish. Trammell
responded by hitting a career-
high .343 with 28 home runs,
105 runs batted in and 205 hits.

He was the first Tiger since Al
Kaline in 1955 to have 200 hits
and 100 RBI in the same season.

Trammell was 3-for-9 in the

season-ending series against

Toronto, with one home run and
two RBI. His home run tied the
first game and his second RBI, on
a ball through shortstop Manny
Lee's legs, won the second game.

There were no excuses from
Bell after, the Tigers swept the fi-

nal three games from Toronto in '

Detroit.

”They gave me the pitches to
hit. I missed them,” he said.

Since ‘becoming a full-time
player with Toronto in 1984, Bell
has averaged .296 with 33
homers and 106 RBI.

He was drafted by Toronto in
1980 from the Philadelphia Phil-
lies organization, despite missing

E most of that season with a stress

fracture in a shoulder. ~

Jackson opens baseball    
card shop in Pittsburgh 

(AP) — Bo Jackson of the Los
Angeles Raiders isn't the only
football—playing Jackson who
likes to dabble in baseball. So
does Pittsburgh Steelers run-
ning back Earnest Jackson.

Bo Jackson, also an out-
fielder for the Kansas City Roy-
als, made headlines last
summer when he announced
he would play for the Raiders
as a hobby. Earnest Jackson's
hobby is cards — baseball
cards, that is.

Earnest Jackson, who avidly
began collecting baseball
cards about six years ago, re-

cently opened a baseball card
shop in a suburban Pittsburgh
shopping center. He sells full
sets of cards as well as single

' cards worth hundreds of dol-

lars apiece.

Jackson has no idea how
many cards are in his personal
collection, although he esti-
mates he has tens of
thousands.

”l’ve been collecting them

._ for 10 or 15 years, but it's only

been the last six years‘ I've real-
ly gotten into it,” Jackson said
Tuesday. ”|t’s just like playing
the stock market  the cards

' likely will increase in value as

9 

 

go up and down in price. You
try to buy them when they're
selling low and sell them ,
when they're trading high.”

Pete Rose's 1962 rookie
card, for example, has sold for
as much as $600 and as low
as $150 in recent years, but

Rose nears entry into the Base-
ball Hall of Fame, Jackson
said.

Jackson said he's more a fan
of the cards than baseball it-
self. ’’I love the cards,” he
said.

Paterno upset over firing of OSU’s Bruce

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November. T8, T987

 

By David S. Martin

Associated Press Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — The
firing of Ohio State football coach
Earle Bruce sends a signal to
young coaches that winning is
more important than playing fair-
ly, Penn State Coach Joe Paterno
said Tuesday.

’’I think it's going to be a terri-
ble signal to young coaches who
want to make a career of it and
want to be clean doing it,” Pater-
no said during his weekly press

‘ conference.

"It doesn't make it any easier
to get good young people into the
game, nor does it make it easier
to convince people they shouldn't
cheat,” he added.

Ohio State, 5-4-1, has lost three
straight games by a total of 10
points and has its worst record
since 1966.

Ohio State University President
Edward Jennings on Tuesday said
Bruce's firing was not because of
the Buckeyes win-loss record, but
he couldn't elaborate because of
the school's policy of not discuss-
ing personnel issues.

Bruce's ouster
prompted the resignation of Ath-
letic Director Rick Bay. .

Paterno said, ”lt’s a sad com-
mentary obviously for our coach-
ing profession when a [coach]
wins a Cotton Bowl game last
year and loses three or four
games this year [and then] is out
of a job.”

Bruce had a 10-3 record last
year, with a 28-12 victory over
Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl.
He will coach in the season finale
Saturday against Michigan.

”The program at Ohio State is
not what the program was at
Ohio State in the '50s and '60s,

Monday I

 

Earle Bruce

when the rest of the country
didn't have as many scholar-
ships,” Paterno said.

Since then, the NCAA has set
limits on the number of football
scholarships, Paterno said.

In 1979, the NCAA restricted
the number of scholarships to 30
in any one class and 95 total.
Next year, coaches will be limit-

ed to 25 players on scholarship,
with the overall limit of 95 re-
maining in effect.

Also, colleges now give black
athletes from the South a chance,
meaning there are more good
football players in college pro-
grams, according to Paterno.

”An awful lot of people have
an awful lot of good football play-
ers,” he said. ’’It’s very tough for
any school to dominate.”

Paterno said he wasn't aware of
any recruiting violations by Ohio
State in the nine years Bruce has
coached at his alma mater.

’’It a tough profession, but
there's got to be some consider-
ation of what is fair,” said
Paterno. .

Paterno has never had a losing
record in his 38 years as a Penn
State coach (the last 22 as head
coach)

But Paterno, who has 206

0 Monday night's Bears-
Broncos matchup was the best
NFL game played on national TV
in ages. Had Chicago QB Jim
McMahon not injured his ankle
late in the game, it would have
been even better, maybe a fourth
consecutive come-from-behind
win for the Bears. For those of
