“Rosie” knew a lot about stereo-
types. As mail—order bride from the
Philippines, she faced stereotypes that she
must be a meek, passive woman who
wanted to marry a Western man simply
for economic advancement. Many people
assumed she would be willing to "cater to
her husband’s every whim.

No one ever said stereotypes couldn’t
be deﬁed.

the anthropology and international studies

still live with his mother, for example.
There are many incorrect, precon-
ceived ideas about mail—order marriages,
creating a difficulty for Constable in writ-
ing this book. One of the manners in
which she dispelled the stereotypes was
through examining the motivations of the

* couples.

Most of the men who participate in
this type of Internet dating do so because
they are looking for a woman who is not
career—centiic, who is willing to put rais-
ing a family first, and who is not likely to
seek a divorce. The men feel they cannot
ﬁnd this type of woman -in the United
States anymore, Constable reported,
countering the stereotype that the men
want only a submissive, meek woman.

One of the couples Constable inter-
viewed was Rosie and Ben, who request-
ed that their real names not be used. When
Constable met Ben, he had just become
engaged to Rosie, a Filipino woman, after
an Internet courtship. Both were commu-
nicating with others on the Web, but ‘after
meeting each other, they decided to make
a commitment to one another. “‘

There was just one problem: Rosie
didn’t know if she was married or not.

’ Years earlier, she had become preg-
nant by the son of her employer. Her
employer drew up a marriage certificate,
but Rosie did not know if it had ever been
ﬁled.

It had. Annulments were hard to
come by  the Philippines, but Ben
would not let the absent husband get in
the way of their love. Fora year, he fought
to get an annulment for Rosie, and once it.
was granted, they moved back to the
United States for his work and got mar-.

At $7.99 apiece, Glofish

don’t appeal to everyone

Gloﬁsh, page 1

with mutated zebra ﬁsh for years as a model

for human development and disease

processes. At their labs, where they have the
capacity for more than 100,000 ﬁsh in 3,000
aquariums, scientists have been able to cre-
ate zebra ﬁsh with glowing blood vessels,
intestines and eyes, all for the betterment of

man, Bahary said. '

Yorktown Technologies, an Austin,‘

Texas, company licensed to market the
Gloﬁsh, has reported a high demand for the
ﬁsh. According to a press release, the com-
pany was so overwhelmed by orders in
December 2003, that they were forced to
start selling them before the Jan. 5, 2004,
release date. ‘

Many pet stores and aquarium enthusi-
asts fueled the demand and hype for the
Gloﬁsh, but sales of the Gloﬁsh haven’t been
that tremendous in the Pittsburgh market.

Gary Knabe, owner of Elmer’s
Aquarium in Monroeville, said he’s had a
lukewarm response. Elmer’s bought a small
number of the Gloﬁsh when they were
released, but poor sales have made Knabe
wary of ordering more. , .

“We’ve had lots of people come in ask-
ing questions, and [the Gloﬁsh] has gotten a
lot of attention, but so far, we’ve only sold a
couple,” Knabe said.

At a sticker price of $7.99 apiece, the
Gloﬁsh has turned off many people, accord-
ing to Knabe. A normal zebra ﬁsh retails at
Elmer’s for 69 cents.

Knabe is taking a wait—and-see
approach with the Gloﬁsh, and he does not
plan to order more in the near future. The
aquarium and pet shop has more than 300
varieties of ﬁsh, and~Knabe says he had no
problem not selling the Gloﬁsh.

“I think it would be cool to have one,”
said Jen Booth, a senior at Pitt who is con-
templating buying a Gloﬁsh. “It’s OK for
fun, but maybe messing with a ﬁsh like that
is taking it too 

Not everyone is eager to see the Gloﬁsh

' sold to the public. Although most people on

either side of the issue have no particular
vendetta against the Gloﬁsh, many believe
that the glowing ﬁsh represents an even big-
ger issue of who regulates genetically altered
animals and why.

9 In California, where the use of geneti-
cally altered ﬁsh is allowed in laboratories,
the state has issued a ban on the. sale of
Gloﬁsh. In a Dec. 17, 2003, editorial in the
San Francisco Chronicle, Sam Schuchat, a
member of the California Fish and Game

Commission, said that he voted “yes” on the
ban to sell Gloﬁsh because he felt he ‘had the
moral responsibility to protectCalifomia’s
environment.

“Because selling transgenic zebra ﬁsh
as pets has no public beneﬁt, and there is
always some risk, ﬂue commission voted not
to start down the path toward genetically
modiﬁed pets,” Schuchat said.

According to Schuchat, the unknown
risks of genetically altered animals, even a
tropical ﬁsh that scientists like Bahary say
could not survive in North America’s water-
ways, are far too great to_ ignore. He and oth-
ers, like the Center for Food Safety, argue
that the Gloﬁsh could wreak havoc on the
environment if released into the wild by
either crowding out other ﬁsh or eating the
food supplies of others.

Schuchat and others also argue that a
federal or international body should regulate
the distribution of genetically altered ﬁsh to
ensure there is no impact on the world’s
environment But the only federal body to
address the matter of Gloﬁsh is the Food and
Drug Administration, which oversees genet-
ically altered_anirnals for human consump-
tion.

According to the FDA Web site,
because the zebra ﬁsh is an aquarium pet and
not meant to be eaten, there is no speciﬁc
threat to the general population. I

. Some organizations that oppose the
Gloﬁsh are taking legal action. The Center
for Food Safety, which acts as a watchdog
for human food production, ﬁled suit against
the FDA on Jan. 14, 2004, to stop the sale of
the Gloﬁsh.

“The lawsuit is to force the FDA to
acknowledge their jurisdiction on this,” Culp

said. “’Ihere’s no determination if this ﬁsh is

safe for consumption. What if some college
st11dents decide, on a prank, to see how
many Gloﬁsh they could eat? It’s a derelic-
tion of the FDA and USDA that they won’t
acknowledge our concern.”

The CFS is advocating public debate
and regulatory agency oversight to ensure

that genetically altered animals are not able.

to make their way into the enviromnent
Culp and others fear that the Gloﬁsh could
open the ﬂoodgates to countless other genet-
ically altered animals.

“What if someone ﬁnds the market for
a piranha that could survive in cold waters,
so aquariumists wouldn’t be impeded by
having to buy expensive warming equip-
ment to keep them?” asks Culp. “Imagine

Scientists Worldwide have relied upon
zebra ﬁsh to better understand important
questions in genetics and molecular biology,
and the ﬂuorescent zebra ﬁsh have been par-
ticularly helpful in understanding cellular

disease, as well as cancer and gene therapy. -

The Gloﬁsh was developed by the
National University of Singapore for the
purpose of detecting pollution. There, a team
of scientists altered certain genes in the zebra
ﬁsh so that it would change colors based on
what pollutants were in water. According to
the NUS Web site, “this transgenic ﬁsh, bred
successfully through genetic engineering, is
a simple alternative to complicated pollu-
tant-testing systems. In using such trans-
genic ﬁsh, pollutants can be detected with
one quick look The ﬁsh are also biodegrad-
able and economical to breed.”

The NUS site also states that other

as carp and goldﬁsh. They arealso develop-

Pitt study finds kids who can’t use drugs

‘An alarming bit of research from
Cl1ildren’s Hospital of Pittsburgh found that
certain antibiotics are inelfective for twice as
many Pittsburgh kids as the projected
national average. ‘Almost 10 percent‘ of
Pittsburgh kids‘ are resistant to a family of
antibiotics, compared to the national rate —
reportedly 5 or 6 percent — according tothe
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Though researchers are hesitant to say
why Pittsburgh has such high rates, the study
states that "such regional variation may indi-
cate a coming rise in resistance nationwide.
However, researchers were not hesitant to
cite “inappropriate use” as a possible cause
of this resistance. And the Centers for
Disease Control note that antibiotic resis-
tance is primarily caused by .ovenr_redica—
tion. 1

Such overmedication is all too com-
mon. Because people associate pills‘ with
cures, they ask for medication, and doctors
prescribe it. While this can be done to stave
off secondary infections — a serious threat
—- it is also done to assuage parents’ fears

about their children.

Antibiotics are powerful medical tools
— ones that have saved countless lives. If
..they are. to continue being effective, they
must not be overused If antibiotics are given
unnecessarily, they kill all the bacteria in an
organism, save _a few that carry resistance to

the medication. These  then reproduce, ’
rendering antibiotics useless in hosts who

carry these bacteria. Such resistance spreads
‘rapidly, and is a matter of public, as well as

individual, health. .

This resistance may also be indicative
of changes in medical care. Doctors now
work at the behest of larger corporations and
have less time to spend with patients, mak-
ing medication, rather than careful diag-
noses, the solution to many problems. ‘

The Pittsburgh study, which was pub-
lished in the February 1 edition of
Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy,
tested a variety of streptococcal bacteria —
the‘ bacteria responsible for strep throat.
These bacteria were taken from children and
were found to be resistant to macrolides, a
family of antibiotics including ery-
thromycin. ‘

Strep throat has many symptoms that
resemble common Viral diseases such as the
ﬂu or the common colds. Antibiotics, which
kill bacteria, are useless for these.

People want something tangible to bat-
tle disease, something more scientiﬁc than,
say, chicken soup.

But chicken soup was actually found to\
mitigate upper respiratory tract infections, in
a study published in Chest, a medical journal
focusing on the cardiopulmonary region.

Such remedies may seem old-fashioned
in light of recent medical technologies. But
human bodies are equipped to handle many
infections without the aid of antibiotics. Our
entire immune system has evolved many
ways of dealing with invading organisms.

_ And if people continue to demand
antibiotics, such defenses might be the best
thing we have against strep season.

Curing writer’s block with sandwiches

Writer’s block. -Everyone gets it, at
some point or another. Evenme. I have
found myself lacking in opinions this
week +— I’m so tired of ‘debates on same-
sex marriage, abortion and politics that
the thought of writing more than a sen-
tence or two _on one of them is more sick-
ening than that of drinking an entire plas-

"tic bottle of Crown Russe

vodka VV1thout a chaser.

Instead of trying to con-
jure up some sort of com-
pelling, witty -argument
against free trade or corpo-
rate lobbyists, I’m just going ’
to embrace my writer’s
block wholeheartedly.

' Even the most dedicat-
ed gym-goers encounter‘
days when they cannot even
entertain the thought of
breaking a sweat. Every
artist will eventually find

ever to show up, but they always do get-

there.

What’s more, none of the so—called

“cures” for a blank mind -— changes of

eliminating a tough case of writer’s block.

That’s not to say great works have
not been produced after or during vaca-
tions or drugbinges. They have. But, in
the same way that getting drunk while in
a bad mood is unlikely to cheer anyone up
for long, taking drastic steps for creativi-
ty.’s sake-isn’t going to ﬁx everything.

If you’re feeling inspired and you

ﬁnally find yourself able to write or draw
or run again. True, you might be on some
crazy trip in a cheap motel in a foreign
country, but it’s just as likely that you’ll
be making yourself a sandwich or walk-
ing to class.

Until then, don’t worry too much,

because if there is one thing that is proven
" not to aid in lifting writer’s ‘

block, it’s excessive worrying.
Go about your daily routine
and wait for something to hit
you. Right now, I’d like to
throw in some sort of horrible
joke about something “hit-
ting” you and not getting run
over by a bus, but it just isn’t
going to work. ‘

ly. Life goes on, and if I can

puns, then my duty is done.

remember that I have not only valid opin-
ions on serious topics, but also the ability
to express myself serni-eloquently.
Maybe I_’ll spend the whole day stuttering
and confused. If that’s the case, so be it.
At least I have the experiences of writer’s
block and complete out—of-it-ness to draw
on when I eventually do ﬁnd myself in
what some refer to as “the zone.”

In the meantime, as I aimlessly wan-
der outside of this mystical “zone,” there
are a few things I am sure of. I refuse to
get a single extra gray hair — and yes, I
have a few — because I’ve got nothing to

to look both ways before I cross the street

Arguments against gay marriage based in religion, not law

Is the political game just a contest of semantics? I
suppose your reply would depend on what your deﬁ-
nition of ‘is’ is. Or, more recently, what your deﬁni-
tion of marriage is.

Courts in several states have been
grappling with the issue of gay civil
union and even — gasp —— sarne-sex
marriage. This seemingly simple
issue has surprisingly high stakes,
high enough that the president has
endorsed the idea of a constitutional
ban on gay marriage.

The basic argument behind this is
that allowing sarne-sex couples to
marry somehow infringes on the
sanctity of heterosexual marriage.
I’ve read many articles on the topic
and I have yet to be convinced that
this is a real threat to any heterosexu-
al marriage that may be in my future.

The religious right would have us all believe that
marriage is a sacred comrrritrnent between a man and
a woman before God, and that any variation on this is
an insult to the very idea of marriage. This argument,
though, is ﬂawed. ,

First, even within the long tradition of Christian
religion, marriage has not always conformed to this.
deﬁnition. Oftentimes, there was nothing sacred. about
it. Instead, it was a ﬁnancial union between two peo-
ple who were indifferent to each other, at best, or a
political union between two powerful people. Love

Columnist

had nothing to do with it; wealth and power were the ~-

factors that determined marriage partners.

  

Ginger ‘McCall

Second, there are already thousands of marriages
in the United States that do not ﬁt these strict guide-
lines. Followers of non—Christian religions get married
in the United States. Atheists and agnostics get mar-

ried here. It happens everyday.

So why is there such a stigma on homosexu-
ality? What is the basis of this prejudice that
disguises itself as guarding family values? The
answer is several- passages in a controversial
chapter from the Bible that have been translat-
ed and analyzed by thousands of people.

Every single person I talk to seems to have a
different read on the true message of the book,
what is allowed and not allowed. And the pas-
sage in question‘— “You shall not lie with a
man as with a woman; itis an abomination”
(Lev. 18:22) —— comes only two sentences

I away from a passage about the uncleanness of
menstruating women and in the same book that
commands that no one eat blood.

The latter two beliefs don’t still hold much sway
over the majority of the public, so why should the for-
mer? There seems to be no logical pattern to the
embracing or discarding of Biblical beliefs.

And even if there was, even if this passage proved

 

.. conclusively that the Judeo-Christian God ‘ever has

been and ever shall be against homosexuality, should

. that really have any bearing on the laws that our
nation passes? The answer, for anyone who cares

aboutthe separation of church and state, is a resound-
ing “no.’.’ Individual religious beliefs should have no
inﬂuence over lawsand government. -

But the separation of church and state hasn’t been

respected lately. Instead, the president has broken a
fundamental principle of U.S. law. Bush and the reli-
gious right make it their business to actively oppress a
group that they consider inferior. And what is this idea
of inferiority based on? The fact that a religious text
may declare this group morally inferior.

And the mainstream liberal candidates for presi-
dency are doing little to combat this blatant violation
of the separation. Instead, Sen. John Kerry (D—Mass.)
is playing word games. According to Foxnews.com,
he said, “I believe the right answer is civil unions. I
oppose gay marriage and disagree. with the
Massachusetts court’s decision.”

Kerry is sitting on the fence. Certainly gay rights
are good, but he’s not willing to take a stand on the

. issue. Instead, Kerry and several other key Democrats

are settling for the idea of civil unions that don’t pro-
vide the same benefits or rights as marriage.

This strikes a familiar chord with many people. 0

It’s the old “separate but equal” routine. We’ll give
you something almost like our marriage, but take
away some of benefits and give it ano er name so
that there will be no confusion. Make no mistake; this
is not equality. It is one person’s morals — inspired by
religion —— being imposed upon another individual.

True equality and fairness would recognize that
the deﬁnition of sacredbis dependent on whom you
ask. The sanctity of marriage is based on the idea that
two people who love each other — regardless of race,
class or gender — desire to make a lifelong comrnit-
ment to one another.

United States has partially earned its international resentment

“Why are we so hated?”

Following Sept. 11, 2001, and in the
wake of this war on terrorism, it is a
question that has oft been asked but
rarely examined.

The answers given, particularly in
regards to the Middle East, have been
simpliﬁed to a combination of govern-
ment propaganda, biased media outlets
and religious extremism, even sheer
envy. =
While these reasons have their mer-
its, they all have one thing in common
— they present anti-Americanism as
ﬁmdarnentally irrational and unsubstan-
tiated, a sentiment reﬂective of astonish-
ing condescension on our part.

As a buddy of mine abruptly ended
our discussion recently by saying that
the popular opinion is that “it is trendy to
hate America —- that’s all.”

We have assumed a position of
moral supremacy to those who oppose
our policies, but the question of our enti-

tlement to such a stance has not been .

pursued. Our history is not that of pro-
motion of democracy and freedom. It is
one of pursuit of national interest.

If the democraey.ﬁts, great. If not, a
pro-American dictator is a good altema-
tive.

While we forget the Shahs of Iran

and our support of Saddam Hussein, the
people whose lives were affected do not
 carmot. It is their Pearl Harbor, their

Sept. 11,.2001 — not as sudden, not as I

stunning, but far more devastating.

We have made the world our politi-
cal playground, and the
resulting side effects have
produced anti-American sen-
timents, most visibly in
regions that have repeatedly
seen the impact of our ulteri-
or motives in their own back-
yards.

Instead of prompt dis-
missal, these misguided
decisions should be appro-
priately blamed for their con-
siderable contribution to
anti-Americanism abroad.

Yes, of course, targeting civilians is
a most appalling tactic. Certainly, noth-
ingg we have done warrants such
deplorable acts as witnessed on Sept. 11,
2001. But the necessityto place such
disclaimers alongside any criticism -of
U.S. policies, so as not to be labeled
anti-American, reveals just the sort of
reﬂexive apprehension this nation con-
tinues to exhibit at the insinuation of col-
lective blame for the current state of
affairs.

We are neither the great Satan from
the West, nor are we the saint.

I do not need explanations for our
administrations’ policies. I understand
yesterday’s threat of expanding commu-
nism. I understand the importance of
Israel today. I understand
the politics that have affect-
ed our foreign policy choic-
es, and I do not neglect the
inevitable inﬂuence of
national interest.

The people whose lives
have been affected by such
decisions, however, would
surely appreciate explana-
tions.‘ ‘ _' «

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

PAGE 7

2003 has been over for close to two months now, but that hasn’t stopped people everywhere from talking about the year in music. From magazines

I and newspapers to awards shows and Monday morning quarterbacks, everyone has an opinion on whatthe best album was in 2003, who had the best
single and what so-and-so was smoking when they recording this-and-that.

It’s time for The Pitt.News’ music writers to throw their two cents into this discussion. There are some similarities in the following lists of best
albums, but they're also entirely different. Read them, debate them, love them, and hate them. And for some more Best Of fun, go to www.pittnews.com

Rock music strikes back

BRIAN PALMER
Staff Writer

New artists, some good and some bad,
made their presence known in 2003, but it

ultimately was a fairly decent year in

music. Gangsta rapper 50 Cent burst onto
the scene with the Erninem-and-Dr. Dre-
produced Get Rich or Die Trying.
Meanwhile, producer and music mogul

- Pharell was just about everywhere on the

music radar screen. A ,

A ‘Rock music had a huge showing. with
new releases from bands like Nickelback,
The White Stripes and Coldplay. New
artists like The Darkness, Evanescence and
Jet burst into the business, bringing a new
sound, as well as a rejuvenated old sound.

At the beginning of every year, every-
body comes up. with their choices of top
albums of the previous year, and who they
think is the cream of the crop. This -is my
take.

5.TheBens—IheBensEP .

The only reason this isn’t higher on
the list is because it was simply an EP of
four songs. Buttthose four songs are some
of the best music puton one album, and it
comesfrom a seemingly unlikely collabo-
ration of Ben Kweller, Ben Lee and Ben
Folds. All three styles converged to make
four intriguing tracks that refuse to leave
your head. ' i

ning to end. ’

3. Blink 182 —— Blink 182 -
This maybe the best album Blink has
ever released. Well, if not
best, then most mature
and emotional. Blink left
behind their fart joke
songs and songs about
enemas, and took on
more serious subjects,
and — surprise — they
have matured musically.

more than a few heads in
the music industry. VV1th

1. Brand New —'— Deja Entendu

Everyone jumped on the Brand Newt

bandwagon in 2003. And why not? With
their release of Deja Entendu, a powerful

and emotional screamo album‘

that surprised many and
wowed all, Brand New was
hotin 2003.

With bands maturing

and new bands bursting onto

. the scene, 2003 was a success-

ful year for music. With Janet

glory and OutKast turning

even more heads, 2004 looks

to be ﬁlled with more antics

and hopefully more great
music.

Grasping for some hope

AMY WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

2003 was a crazy year. It was the
year of Britney Spears’ and Madonna’s
hopeless publicity stunt. It was the year
of the death of a god, Johrmy Cash. It
was the year of the rise and fall of an

empire known as Bennifer. It was also a

“hard year to pick out favorite albums

and songs. I have one album that hasn’t
left my CD player and about 10 tied for

;second place. I had to sort through

mind-numbing hip-hop anthems using

"the words “hurr or thurr,” and climb

through the hopeless attempts of
Hillary Duff and FeFe Dobson, It was-'
n’t an easy climb, but here are the rocks
that I grabbed on to in 2003'.

5. Blink 182 —— Blink 182

After their horrid last album, Take
of Your Pants and Jacket, I was Very
hesitant to buy this album. Then I start-
ed reading the reviews and decided to
give it a try. These boys ﬁnally grew up
and changed for the better. This is their
best album to date

4. All American Rejects -— All
American Rejects

Call me a sucker for pop punk. I’m
just going to be honest. Their catchy
first single, “Swing, Swing” wouldn’t

leave my head for weeks until I bought/

the CD. The rest of it, with standout
songs like “Your Star” and “My Paper
Heart,” keptvme hooked.‘ It’s a great
album overall.

3. Yellowcard '-—— Ocean Avenue

I was exposed to Yellowcard on the
Warped Tour this summer and became
instantly hooked. Their album is fun,
plain and simple. It’s a blend of pop-
punk anthems and Sean Mackin’s violin
playing. It seems like almost an awk-
ward combination, but somehow, it
really works.

2. Eisley — Marvelous Things

After hearing the title track of this
EP, I became completely mesmerized
by this band. They are a breath of fresh
air; simple songwriting and melodic
voices leave you in a trance. I can’t get
enough of them. They are currently
working on their first full-length album.
Its release is one of the things I look
forward to most in 2004.

1. Brand New — Deja Entendu
Picking the next four after this bril-
liant album is the hardest thing to do,
since this has been in my CD player
nonstop since its release in June. Don’t
judge a band by their first album. Since
the band’s first release, Your Favorite
Weapon, the members have grown up.

Changing musical directions deﬁnitely ,

worked for this band. Jesse Lacey’s
tongue-in-cheek songwriting and versa-
tility in the album makes it a must—have.

Although these albums are just
what I listened to the most this year,
there are many more artists worth men-
tioning and artists who need to be
plugged for 2004. Artists who I need to
mention that got me through this year
include Thursday, Coheed and
Cambria, Bright Eyes, Evanescence,
Bon Jovi (yep, I love them and always
will), The White Stripes, Story of the
Year, and so many more. As for 2004, I
am looking forward to some great
bands coming to Club Laga before its
demise. I can’t wait for the releases
from Straylight Run, Taking Back
Sunday, Eisley, and, if I am very lucky,
another fantastic  Brand New-_

5. Four Tet — Rounds

The capability’ of recording artists to automate, cut,
paste, and create their songs through electronic manip-
ulation offers two possibilities for songwriting in the
future: It will either bow down to the ease of technolo-
gy—dependent creation,- or it will use the technology to
push musical limits further than imaginable. VV1th
Rounds, we see solo artist Kieran Hebden (aka Four
Tet) embracing the latter. An album rife with original
sounds, Rounds is incessant in its desire to experiment
without drifting into obscurity. Between glitchy beats
and ultra-ﬁltered samples, a beautiful work unfolds.

4. Ted Leo & the Pharmacists — Hearts of

Ted Leo’s enthusiasm is inspiring.
While other New York bands took to syn-
thetic beats and vintage keyboards, as part of

lution, Ted Leo and company got the dance
ﬂoor moving by channeling Elvis Costello
and passing out ﬁying pans and tam-
bourines for audience members to bang. On
Hearts of Oak, Ted Leo’s squeaky, throb-
bing falsetto hovers above clangy guitar
strurns and jumpy beats. From the deli-
ciously catchy “Where Have All The
Rudeboys Gone” to the thumping “Ballad
of the Sin-Eater,” Hearts never hit a sore
note. - ' ’

3. The Shins — Chutes Too Narrow

Drifting between folksy campﬁre songs
and rowdy, ‘60s-pop style, Chutes Too
Narrow is 2003’s catchiest album,_hands
down. Front man James Mercer’s lofty
vocals tower over jangled guitars, meandere » ‘
ing into uncharted melodic territory that
always seems simultaneously surprising" and
stupidly simple. Either way, Chutes’ easygo- "
ing pop choruses and deft witticism are
always intriguing and often quite touching. ‘S

2. Non-Prophets — Hope — .

On Hope, underground rap hero Sage
Francis brings his raspy ﬂow so hard that his ‘
lyrical stabs and enraged political dissent are
hard to keep track of. “Going gold with a
fool’s heart/I’d rather be a fool with a heart
of gold,” Francis rhymes on 
307 Elsewhere, Francis condemns‘ Bill
O’Reilly and noisy toddlers, points an angry
ﬁnger at sell-out MCs, and asserts, “I’m not
left wing or right wing/I’m the middle ﬁn-
ger.” The abtmdance of brilliant lyricism
found on Hope makes it not only a repeat-
edly entertaining listen, but a testament to
hip-hop’s future. As Francis puts it, “hip-
hop’s not dead/It’s just sick of being person-
iﬁ ” '

1. Basement Jaxx — Kish Kash

British dance gurus Felix Buxton and
Simon Ratcliife have yet to release a dud — ,

Themes of heartbreak and ex-lover animosity run ram-

that made even the most dance—loatl1ing stiff (i.e.,
myself) shake a leg. Vlfrth Kish Kash, the group comes
to the music scene with arty songwriting, elaborating on p
their instantly gratifying grooves with splatter—paint syn-
thesizers, weirdo sarnples and crisp, complex beats.

pant through Kish Kash’s 14 lush tracks, from the
Gloria Gaynor—ish “Good Luck” to the downbeat glory
of “If I Ever Recover.” Kish Kash’s all-star guest list
(Dizzee Rascal,_Siouxsie Sioux, and *NSYNC’s J.C.
Chasez all make appearances) speaks volumes about -
the group’s ability to use nearly any. voice as dance-song
fodder. While decidedly more somber and challenging
than their previous work, Kish Kash is a vibrant burst in A, , ., »

Even in down times, there’s good music to be found

IAN REED
Staff Writer

I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again
—— now is not a good time for rock music.
Right now, we are in a sort-of post-ejacula-
tion, musical refractory period. We are
between movements. In a funk, if you 
The medium is changing. VV1th songs being
distributed online, you have to ask what is
to become of the album. Will it be a lost art
form? And the most successful genres in
popular music today are country and hip-
hop. As I am sure fans of these genres are
not complaining, we rock fans are wonder-
ing, “Where is our Brian Wilson? Where is
our Kurt Cobain? Where is our revolu-
tion?”

"Fortimately, 2003 featured good music
in several genres, though they might have
been a little harder to ﬁnd. The following is
my list of the top albums of 2003. Handle
with care.

5. Jay Z —- The BlackAlbum.

Not the best album I’ ve heard, but the
ﬁfth best of 2003. This is Jay Z’s attempt to
establish himself as the “best rapper alive.”
Is he? No, but he claims to be. And
although he gives the stereotypical rap
“rags to riches” message throughout the
album, he does it with a level of maturity

X?‘

that is superior to most of his peers.

4. Prefuse 73 — One Word Extinguisher +
Extinguished: Outtakes.

This can be best described as dark
brand of hip-hop; a techno variety of hip—
hop. This is on the list
because of its excellent
production. This is one of
those albums that might, at
ﬁrst listen, sound like
noise to some. But those - 
who can uncover what is
underneath the sound are
in for a treat.

3. Blur — Think Tank
Recorded in Damon

Albam’s London studio,

and elsewhere in England

Tank is everything a Blur
fan could wantin afollow-V -
up to-I3 and more. Therift ‘_
that almost destroyed the
band just prior to the 7‘
album’s recording makes a «
this new release all the
more amazing. Standout
track: “Sweet Song.” The echoed pianos
and bass under A1bam’s vocals  you
up like a warm blanket.

2. OutKast — Speakerboxxxﬂhe Love
Below. ‘

Andre 3000 and Big Boi are obviously
_ a level above every other rap artist out
there. In a genre where staying power is a
rare commodity, OutKast has been around

for 10 years. While other rappers consis-
tently rap about the difﬁculties of leaving
the ghetto to become rap artists, Andre
30()0 croons about love — a very welcome

deviation from the norm. If Radiohead is
the best in the rock business, OutKast is
deﬁnitely best in the rap world.

1. Radiohead — Hail to the Thief
“Where is our Brian Wilson?” might
be the question we’re asking today. But in
30 years, people will be asking, “Where is
our Thom Yorke?” Yorke is the single best
pop musician in the world today. He under-
stands something ﬂiat the rest of us do not.
His latest creation, Hail to the Thieﬁ is not
an easy listen, but it is an extremely reward-
ing one. It is obvious that the members of
Radiohead, as a band, believe that good pop

,music must be diﬂicult. Thus, Hail to the
Thief requires repeated listens to appreciate. /

Like all good music, each song improves
with every listen. Hail to the Thief is a mas-
terful collection of songs and proves why
Radiohead is still the best in the business.

For those of you who are waiting for
the next big thing, I strongly urge you to lis-
ten to these albums. Even though we are in
the midst of a funk, there is good music out

there if you look hard enough. Honorable

mentions for 2003 include wonderful

‘albums by Cat_ Power, ‘The Rapture, The

Shins and Justin Timberlake. People to look
for in 2004? The Neptunes, Billy Corgan,
Eddie Vedder, Radiohead, The Pixies and
Wrlco.

A one, and that’s cool with me. .

A list of the best music from 2003 that will

get you rocking — even in tough times

ADAM RAUF
For The Pitt News

There were many albums released last year. Only a
few were especially important. We had our share of ups
and downs in the past year, with the deaths of Johnny

Cash and Elliott Smith, the dissolution of bands such as

Penfold and Elliott (not to be confused with Elliott
Smith), and then good news, such as the Pixies reunion
tour. But ladies and gentlemen, there is a reason for my
rambling. These next ﬁve albums will get you through;

out in your chair, so here we go. .

Amnesiac to keep everyone satisﬁed. A—plus, boys.

Honorable mentions also go to Smith (RIP), Longwave,
Clearlake, Deftones, and thedamnwells for putting out
excellent records, and also to the Kill Bill 0ST, with its

deliciously cheesy and retro ﬂavors. 2004 will see a new _

record from In Flames by spring. Head Automatica,
whichis a side project of Daryl Palumbo of Glassjaw
and famous producer Dan “The Automator” Nakamura,
will also put outﬂanalbum. Dave Grohl’s metal side pro-
ject Probotjust released an album, and Walls of J ericho’s

 comeback album, 'Ajl;lHai,l the Dead, is due at the end of
the trials and tribulations of life, or just make you 'rock‘.. ~

Here’s an unconventional approach
to listing the best music of 2003

JOSHUA T. COHEN
Senior Staff Writer

If you’re into rock and you’re
sick of hearing two-chord progres-
sions over and over again, horribly
simple drum structures, and Kurt
Cobain—esque vocals by some new-
bie, you’re not alone. If you’re into
hip—hop and R&B and sick of point-
less party hooks, cheesy drum
machines, and child molesters in the
top 10, you’re not alone.

2003 was a strange year for
music, to say the least. Over-hyped,
overrated rock artists like The
Strokes and The White Stripes were
forced down our throats by most
major rock coverage in mainstream
media last year. Behind the scenes,
there was an undercurrent of up-and-
coming bands overlooked by the
majority, who steadily managed to
pioneer genre-shifting movements.

One such band is Buffalo-based’

Every Time I Die, who, with their
second Ferret Recordsrelease, Hot

“This isn’t at all unpleasant. I’m
enchanted by lavish ballet, and I’ll
whistlethe tune all the way to the
gallows that I heard at the cabaret,”
screams Keith Buckley, lead singer
and lyricist of “Every Time I Die,”
in a wonderfully poised metal-core
song about attending a musical.
Densely packed with elegant lyrical
substance that encompasses an array
of emotion, Buckley is one of the
defining lyricists of his generation.
His lyrical booklet reads more like a
Shakespearean comedy or tragedy
than what one would expect from an
unrelenting metal act.

Delve a little deeper into the”

underground rock scene and you’ll
find a surprising number of
Christian—hardcore bands that are
also shaking up the industry. Norma
Jean’s Bless the Martyr and Kiss the
Child, Haste the Day’s That They
May Know You, and As I Lay
Dying’s Frail Words Collapse, are
all examples of riveting new direc-

— tions taken in postmodern hardcore.

Unlike Christian bands of the past,

saw the usual bounce and bling dom-
inate the charts, while artists like
Erykah Badu dropped groundbreak-

\ing material that should have been

on everyone’s Christmas gift list.
B'adu’s Worldwide Underground is
the best EP‘of 2003. If you haven’t
bought this wonderfully priced work
of musical genius, drop this paper
and get to your nearest record store.
It makes the work of Dr. Dre and the
Neptunes sound like Fisher—Price
keyboard samples. Grammy—award-
winning Badu has once again rede-
fined herself while offering a mas-
terpiece of auditory stimulus. She
beautifully mixes modern hip—hop
samples with traditional live instru-
mentation. Her vocal presence is
larger than life, and her lyrical con-
tent is, as always, stimulating.

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

  

 

 

‘Gymnastics falls
despite high scores

MATT GRUBBA
Staff Writer

Football and basketball aren’t the
only sports where being at home is an
advantage, and the Pitt gymnastics
team is proof of that.

Despite registering their third-
best score of the season, and ninth-
best score all-time, the Panthers fell
on-the road, l96.475—l94‘.65, at Kent
State on Friday night._ _

Pitt’s record drops to 7-3-1 over-
all, but the team is only 2-3-1 away
from the cozy comforts of Fitzgerald
Field House, a fact that head coach
Debbie Yohman is certainly aware of.

“Kent State is always a‘ tough
place to compete  they were hitting

at 100 percent, and as long as we’re.

scoring falls, we’re not hitting at 100

../percent,” Yohman said about the

- match. The falls Yohman talked about
cost Pitt crucialpoints in its team
score, as did two penalties for step-
ping out of bounds__on_the ﬂoor exer-

cise, the results of “which were”
mandatory tenth-of—a-“point ‘deduc.-V .

tions by the judges." A . . .
Even with the costly. mistakes,

Pitt recorded a high score —-through‘_a=:f
series of standout individual perfor-
mances. April Pearson tallied a-

career-high 9.85 on the vault, part of
a team score,‘ of 48.900, the Panthers’

«solid ' individual

best on any apparatus.

The ﬂoor exercise also yielded
‘ I scores for the
Panthers, the highest being a 9.85 by
Erika Goldberg and a 9.8 by Roslyn

Singleton. Singleton also scored a 9.8 V .
-on the balance beam, drawing praise

from her coach. V

“Roslyn was very good for us.
She was good on the beam; she had a
good ﬂoor exercise; she was very
solid,” Yohman said.

Kent State’s top -individual and
team performances were on the ﬂoor,
as Earline._Feugill registered a near-
perfect 9.975, and no Golden
Flashes’ gymnast scored below 9.8

on the ﬂoor, giving them a team score ‘

of 49.475; -

Pitt tennis prepares for second half of season

MICHAEL CUNNINGHAM
Senior Staff Writer

As the ice begins to thaw and spring draws
near, the Pitt tennis team is set to start the spring
portion of its 2003-2004 season.

»Under the instruction of head coach Georges”
Dieffenbach, the Panthers will look to achieve
their third consecutive winning season. Pitt hosts
Georgetown this Saturday at 4:30 p.m. for its first
dual match since September. .

Pitt (1-0) won a close matchup at Youngstown
State on Sept. 24 thanks to straight—set Wins by No.
1 and No. 2 singles players Becky Emmers and
Annie Davis.

"Last season, the Panthers exploded out of the
gates following the holiday break, sweeping
Wright State before faltering in their next seven

matches. Pitt won 10 of its last 11 matches to fin-
ish the season at 13-9, but the post-holiday slump
prevented the team from making the Big East
Tournament. 4

This year, two returning seniors will try to
ensure that history does not repeat itself. Haley
Hughes is coming off a team-most valuable player

season, and took the court as the No. 3 seed against‘
' Youngstown State. Hughes is among the team’s all-

time leaders in career singles wins and career dou-
bles wins, and with a solid outing this season, she
could break into triple digits in all-time wins.
Laura Pegula transferred to Pitt from Eastern
Michigan in 2001. In her debut season as a Panther,

she racked up an 18-6 singles record en route to"

being named the team’s MVP. This year, her last at
Pitt,‘ she will bring her experience and power to the
court in both a singles‘ and doubles capacity. A -

...r..,.;..,.

Emmers returns for her sophomore campaign-

after posting winning records as both a singles and
doubles competitor as a freshman. Joining her in
the class of 2006 is the team’s lone left-hander,
Emily Hughes. Hughes recorded impressive victo-
ries against St. John’s and Seton Hall last season,
and she will see plenty of doubles action once
again for the Panthers this season.

Junior Konita Judeimade the team as a walk—on

last year, but did not see much action this season.
Thisyear, she already has a straight—set singles vic-
tory under her belt against Youngstown State.
Adding depth to the Panthers’ rosteris freshman
Davis, who brings impressive high school creden-
tials to the Panthers from Parkersburg High School
in West Virginia, as well as freshman Jennifer
Newtz, who was the captain of her tennis squad at
Hopewell High School. A 1- _ ' » ‘

Anything for a win; anything
for a smile. '

Both go hand-in-hand at the
University of Pittsburgh Men’s
Basketball Camp — once a child
smiles, Pitt guard J aron Brown can

.mark it down as one of his many

victories in life.

Brown, who earned hisrdegree
in social sciences last year, loves
working with kids.

He started working with kids in
his senior year of high school, when
he was told that he was getting too
old and too talented to be a player
in his high school coach’s camp.
Instead, he joined his coach and
other college basketball players in
helping the younger kids.

Brown said it was a surprise to
have kids come up to him asking
how they could better themselves as

‘basketball players.

It wasn’t‘ long ago that he was
the one asking the questions. '

It was fun to have players who
were established college basketball
players teaching him how to play,

year honors and set the Bearcat
record for three-point field goal
percentage at‘ .394. Allen was a
guard at Southwest Louisiana, who
led the country in scoring.

Both these players worked at
the camp Brown used to attend. He
said they had the biggest impact on
him and can be given some credit
for the major impact Brown has had
on the basketball courts of Pitt.

Brown, who originally commit-
ted to play for Kentucky. under
coach Rick Pitino, has become one
of Pitt’s brightest stars in recent
years. His coming to Pitt was made
possible by Pitino’s decision to
leave Kentucky for a coaching posi-
tion in the NBA with the Boston
Celtics.

After Brown learned of Pitino’s
decision, he backed out of his com-
mitment and played a season at
Maine Central Institute before mak-
ing his way to Pitt. He ‘led MCI to a
34-4 record and to the New England
Prep Tournament.

In his sophomore year at Pitt, he
started 34 of 35 games, where he
helped lead» the Panthers to the.

Thomas’ decisions could hurt Knicks in the long run

 

. It is a wonderful time to be a New
York Knicks, fan. ‘

Just two months ago, the
Knickerbockers were a punch line to a
bad joke, wallowing in themuck of a
double-digits—under-.500 record
despite being in one of the largest
media markets in the NBA. Latrell
Sprewell, who had beenarguably the
Knicks’ best and most popular player
before being dealt by then-team presi-
dent Scott Layden, was having a career
season over in .Mi_nnesota, and angry
Knicks fans were calling for the heads
of both Layden and head coach Don
Chaney. -

gAnd then, just in time for
Christmas, Santa brought the Knicks
the bad boy with the big smile.

Since taking over for Layden as
Knicks team president in late
December, Isiah Thomas has dealt or
cut eight of the players that were on the
Knicks’ opening-day roster in October.

He has also ﬁred Chaney and replaced
him‘ with the NBA’s all—time wins
leader, Lenny Wilkens. And in the
process, he has re—kind1ed the love
affair between New York City and its
beloved Knicks. ’

S ' Seeing Coney Island native
Stephon Marbury in the orange and
blue is like seeing Andy Taylor back in
Duran Duran; it just feels right.
Thomas’ recent acquisition of Tim
Thomas will help the Knicks run the
ﬂoor more effectively, and Nazr
Mohammed will relieve" Dikembe
Mutombo of some of the pressure in
the paint, as well‘ as provide an insur-
ance policy in case Kurt Thomas
decides to test the free agent market.
After starting off the year so poorly, the
Knicks are right back in the midst of
the Eastern Conference playoff hunt,
and I can once again wear my old
Anthony Mason jersey in public with-
out feeling completely humiliated.

No, things haven’t been this good
for the Knicks since their unlikely run

. to the NBA Finals in 1999. So, if you’re

a Knicks fan like me, enjoy the excite-
ment while it lasts.

Because in two years, the Knicks
are going to be even worse than they
were before Isiah came on the scene.

Thomas obviously had goals of
completely -overhauling the Knicks’

assets, winning immediately in a weak-
ened Atlantic division, and making the
Knicks important in New York again.
And to his credit,‘ he was successful on
all three fronts. But in improving the
Knicks’ immediate fortunes, Thomas
has unabashedly traded away the future
of the franchise".

The Knicks have dealt two future
ﬁrst—round draft picks and their 2005
second-round’ draft pick in their three
trades under Thomas’ tutelage. ‘What

they have acquired in exchange are two

maximum-salary players, under‘ the
NBA’s collective bargaining agree-
ment, in , Marbury and Penny
Hardaway. This only exacerbates the
salary cap problems for a team that
already has a maximum—salary player
in Allan Houston and just bought
Mutombo out of his maximum—salary
deal.

Hardaway. and Mutombo are in the
twilights of ‘their respective careers,
and" the Knicks have ensured that they
will not be able_to bring any young
blood to the Big Apple by taking them-
selves completely out of the draft for
the next two to three years. Much like
the New York ' Rangers, the Knicks_
seem intent on picking up the mam-
moth contracts of players that were
signed by other teams based on poten-
tial and either suffered career—altering

injuries or never lived up to the hype,
and I can’t help but look at this squad
that Thomas- has assembled and think
that, if this were 1998, the Knicks
would be a powerhouse.

What’s even more upsetting about
Thomas’ personnel moves is that no
one in the Eastern Conference has any
chance of competing for the NBA title
with any of the top ﬁve teams out West
for at least the next three years. So
essentially, Thomas is gambling away
his future to compete for the Eastern
Conference title. By the time some of
the great Western Conference teams
start to disband, the Knicks’ window of
opportunity for winning it all will have
slammed shut, -and New York will be
left with a gloriﬁed Big East All-Star
team, much like it suffered under with

Layden at the helm. ’ ’

So thanks for making this year
interesting, Zeke. I will enjoy watching
the Knicks once again compete in the
playoffs come spring. But enjoy your
applause while it lasts, because unless
you prove to be the shrewdest front
ofﬁce manager in the history of profes-
sional sports, Knicks fans will be call-
ing for your head in 2006 the way that
they called for Layden’s head in 2003.

Lyles and McGill lead women to strong regular season finish

MATT EISELE
Staff Writer

Junior Kimberly Lyles, junior
Tamara McGill and senior Matt
Brousse led the women’s and men’s
indoor track teams in the Penn State
Challenge Cup in State College, Pa.,

_. this past weekend.

Lyles electrified the crowd with
her speed Saturday afternoon by
breaking the school record in the
200—meter dash with a time of 23.92,
anchoring the winning 4x400—meter
relay team, and placing fifth in the
60-meter dash with a time of 7.59.

“She was incredible; it really was
mind-boggling what she accom-
plished this past weekend,” said
Alonzo Webb, the head coach of
men’s and women’s indoor track
team.

Trenace Elliot, Lamoy Stephens
and Janine Jones ran on the 4x400-
meter relay team with Lyles, helping
the Panthers win the event with a
time of 3:40:68.

“We ran the B—re1ay team to get
ready forthe Big East Tournament,
and they did a great job,” said Webb.
“They did exactly what I expected,
and they are only going to get better.”

McGill, the leader of the
Panthers, had another great meet. She
won the 60-meter hurdles with a time
of 8.46.

“Tamara is one of the best ath-
letes in the country,” Webb said.
“She always wants to get better; she
is such a competitor and is a true
example of someone leading by
example.”

Fatmata Fofonah continued to
make a name for her self, giving
another great effort against some of
he best in the nation. She finished
third in the 60-meter hurdles with a
time of 8.59.

“We expected her to be at a high
level coming out of high school, and
we have gotten everything we have
expected,” Webb said. “Fatmata has

such a great attitude; she is the kind i

of athlete that we want for the pro-
gram.”

The men’s team was lead by
Brousse, who won the pole vault with
ajump of 4.95 meters.

“He has a great work ethic and a
very good attitude; that is why I
named him the captain,” Webb said.
“Matt is really motivated right now,
and it is coming at the perfect time.”

The Panthers got a huge contri-
bution from star freshman Justin
Clickett, who placed second in the
shot put, with a throw ‘of 17.05
meters. Senior Mike Stellefson also
finished fourth in the event, with a
throw of 16.19 meters.

“Justin always strives to get bet-
ter each meet, and it really shows
when he competes.” Webb said. 1

The Panthers have their biggest
meet of the year this weekend at the
Big East Tournament in Syracuse,
N.Y. '

“We are hoping for the men’s
team to finish in the top half; if
everyone believes, we should be
fine,” said Webb. “The women are
setting up for a good finish, and I
truly believe they will battle for the
championship.”

Panthers look

going to be ready; every meet we’re
improving on something. We are so
close; we’re a good team, but until
we hiton all- 30 scores, we’re not
going to have that whole point jump
in the team score.”

But even with the loss, she was
optimistic about the team’s outlook
going into the stretch’ run of the sea-
son, beginning with a weekend trip to
East Lansing, Mich., to face
Michigan State. _

“We always have a good meet
when‘ we face Michigan State;
whether it’s here or there,_ the judging

always seems to be fair, and we i

always perform well,” Yohman said,
looking ahead to the weekend.

The match at MSU is at 4 p.m. on
Saturday, and it is the team’s last
match before returning home for a

. showdown with Penn State at the end V T
of the month. 6  ' '

Brown, page 14

Now, Brown is making the big
impact on young kids aspiring to
become basketball players.

“He looks like a big brother to
the kids,” said guard Carl Krauser,
who also participated in the camp
over the summer. “He’s very sensi-
tive with the kids. He loves them a
lot.”

Brown says his goals are to give
the kids the advice they need to
hear — to help them think positive-
ly and make them happy. And, judg-
ing by how kidsrespond when with
Brown, he does just that.

“He’s got the big smile, and
kids are drawn to that,” Dixon said.
“I think that’s the biggest key.”

Once, a kid Brown was mentor-

, ing» asked if he could have one of

his practice jerseys and a team shirt.
Brown fulfilled the kid’s wishes,

‘causing a smile to break out on the

child_’s face.

“I was like, ‘dang,”’ Brown
said, smiling and shocked by how
much it meant to the kid.

The kids who sign up for these
camps are not the only ones who
have fun .—- Brown and ‘teammates
have some. fun of their own. They
teach the kids basic basketball
skills and then break them up into
teams. Each player takes a team to
coach, and the teams compete
against each other.

“That’s when you really see [the -

players’] competitiveness,” Dixon
said, laughing as he recalledwhat

. went on last summer.

The players are so competitive
that they’ll go to great lengths to
walk away with a win. They are told
not to teach the kids how to full-
court press, but Brown will do any-
thing to out-coach his fellow team-

mates.

“We cheat sometimes,” Brown
said, smirking. “We’re so,competi-
tive. Ijust tell my team to press.”

Dixon laughs off the matter of
using the full-court press when the
players are not supposed to. He says
it’s just, great to see the players
have such a great impact on the
kids, even if they are bending the
rules to win.

“You see [the kid’s happiness]
face-to-face, side-to-side, and then
you get to meet different -"families
and parents,” Dixon said. “I guess it-
makes me think about when I’ll be
bringing my kid to a camp.”

But will he be in a camp featur-
ing Brown, whose college career is
over after this season? '

It’s quite possible, because this
is what Brown wants to do. He’ is on
a path to be in a position where he
can coach, manage programs —
such as the camps — or just mentor.

“You can tell ‘he has a future
working with kids.” Krauser said. .

Brown is also looking for a
future in the NBA, so could there be
a “Jaron Brown Foundation for
Kids?”

“If I have the money, I’ll do it,”
Brown said. p I

Brown feels that if somebody in

Pitt’s Brown learned to help others on the court from those who helped him

the NBA or in any good career helps
out with kids, it gives the kids extra
motivation to become someone
great. They are seeing the real thing
in front of their faces, and it makes
what they only see on television
come to life.

Brown experienced this surreal
moment when he was in camp with
Burton.

“I know him. He’s on TV,”
Brown said, recalling what his
thoughts were when the college
basketball star was teaching him the
intricacies of the game. Back when
Burton, too, would do anything for
a win and anything for a smile.
