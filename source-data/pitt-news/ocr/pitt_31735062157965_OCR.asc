Board of Trustees to Receive
Complete Architectural Plans

By JOHN

DeNINNO

Cha'nce1lor.Rufus H. Fitzgerald announced Tuesday that

he will soon present to the University Board of Trustees the . 

architectural. plans for a men’s dormoritory, meaning that

, F‘very soon,” ‘possibly within a year, work can begin on the

newest addition to Pitt’s widening campus.

Dr. Fitzgerald, who will‘ retire July 1, has realized for,

A
some time the need for such,a'

building. Last winter he express-
ed a desire to develope Univer-
sity buildingsinto a compact but
extensive campus. He felt that
a real campus could not be possi-
ble unless Pitt had dormitories to
attract students from out of town.

After the acquisition of the
property directly across from the
Fifth Ave. side of the Cathedral
(site of the George Hubbard Clapp
Science Hall), plans were made to
place a, Student Union, dormitory,
and a science hall there. The prop-
e,rty'was formerly a parking lot.
It was donated to the University
by theAndrew W. Mellon Edu-
cational and Charitable Trust
Fund.

The $2,500,000 science hall is
already under construction, and
according to the Chancellor the
dormitory will be next. He esti-
mates that it will cost approx-
imately $500,000. /

Chancellor Fitzgerald saidthat
the men’s dormitory will be only
one wing for a huge building to
house the Student Union and
women’s dormitory. Each dormi-
'tory‘will accommodate approx-
imately 300 students.

After completion of the dorm-
itory for men, and when adequate
funds and land are available, the
Union will be started, followed
by the dormitory for women. Dr.
Fitzgerald explained that since
the dormitories will ﬂank the

Student Union it will be ‘possible ~

to have central eating quarters in
the’Union for both men and wom-
en making more space available
for living quarters in the dormi-
tories. He feels that the Union
will be the center of student life
at Pitt. '
Since the size of the proposed
building necessitates more land
than is now available, the Univer-
sity may acquire more property
on Fifth Ave. Just as the’George
Hubbard Clapp Hall is styled af-
ter the Cathedral of Learning, so
will the new building be Gothic in
style, the Chancellor said.

Dr.‘ Fitzgerald has been asso-
ciated with Pitt for 17 years and
has served as Chancellor for ten.
He came here from the State Uni-
versity of Iowa. While there he
built a student union for that uni-
versity and since coming to Pitt
has worked for the construction

Plan Growth is .

‘The Alumni of the School of

group to contribute to the new $15
million building for the Schools
of the Health Professions.

No Float Parade

Don Kettering, president of In-
terfraternity Council, stated today
that, in all probability, there will
be no float parade this year.

This announcement followed
on the heels of the proposal by
Sudent Congress to move the tra-
ditional event from Spring Carni-
val to Homecoming Weekend.
This year’s Homecoming Week
will begin on Monday, Nov. 15
and continue through the Pitt
Penn State game on the 20th.

The final O. K, rests with I.F.
Council butaccording to Ketter-
ing, “the plan will work fine next
year but there is not enough time
to evolve a program this year.”
He added that, “. . . it will take
some of the strain off Carnival’
since many fraternities produce
shows and build fronts as well as
floats.”

Concerning the advent of a
home-coming float parade ,Ketter-
ing said, “It will make Homecom-
ing more of a campus affair. The
new students as well as the
alumni will see the‘ float parade.
In order to hold the float parade
this year at Homecoming, televi-

I sion rights wouldhave to be ob-

tained for a half-time demonstra-
tion. In addition to this problem,

Engineer’s Advisory Council
Gives Es & M Alumni Voice
Pitt alumni will have a major voice on the new‘Engineer-

and Mines Advisory Council if suggestions'of N. S. Tisdale,
manager of sales for the Molybdenum Corp., are adapted to

this university.

Speaking before Monday’s meeting of top leaders in.

business and industry, Tisdale expressed the need of a three

man committee for
of engineering to include two
graduates and one outsider.

He said, “This is necessary be-
cause it gives an opportunity to
express alumni thinking as well
as an outsider’s point of view,
and putting them together usu-
ally results in some good clear
suggestions.”

Mr. Tisdale was instrumental

in the establishment of a similar-

advisory council at his Alma Ma-
ter, Queen‘s University in Kings-
ton, Ontario, Canada.

Closer relations between fac-
ulty and the committee will im-
mediately result since, ‘the staff
of the college requires constant
support, not_only from the . .
administration but from the grad-
uates,” the executive added.

Experienced businessmen in
attendance. were impressed with
the idea that “It [the staff] needs
help, in getting the latest ideas
to what is going on in the engi-
neering world, it needs help in
getting new equipment, new re-
search programs and construc-
tive criticism as to courses which
may currently be taken and
where emphasis may be more
properly placed in ‘the inculca-
tion of the budding engineer.”

As soon as organization is com-

pleted for the Advisory Council,

each branchO-~~

 

efforts toward a long range E&M
development program will begin.
Tisdale suggested two imme-
diate steps that should be tak-
en: “an appraisal of present equip-
ment to ascertain if it is suiﬁcient
or could be put to work on some

research problem, and a study of ,

the staif’s ability to see if it can
be ﬁtted to the possible problem.”

Pitt Speech Program
To Complete 11th Floor

The Pittsburgh Chapter of the United “Cerebral Palsey

V _'Association has given the University $10,000 to help remodel

the eleventh floor of the Cathedral as part of an expanded
speech correction program, ‘Chancellor R. H. Fitzgerald an-

nounced.

In addition, $76,225 was granted to aid the corrective

speech service for an eight-county‘

area surrounding Pittsburgh. The
program will be housed on the
Cathedral’s eleventh ﬂoor as part"

1- of the speech clinic.

Work on the program is already
underway under the direction of
Dr. Jack Matthews, assistant pro-
fessor of psycho1ogy—speech and
head of the speech clinic in the
department of psychology. The
extensive program has several

. purposes, Matthews said. Initially

it will provide for an increased

"staff and better facilities at the

University’s speech clinic, which
now has a children’s waiting list
from four to five months long. He
said the clinic willvbe able to han-
dle these youngsters more effi-
ciently and provide them more
adequate services.

Mathews explained that an
eight—county survey is underway

ID TO BE CIIECKED

All students wishing to go to
the Pitt-Minnesota Game must
present both their Activity
Card and Registration Card to
gain admittance.

Both cards are needed and
will be checked to prevent un-
authorized persons from gain-
ing entrance. All misused‘
cards will be conﬁscated and
will not be returned to the
owners, according to Jack
Hardman, assistant to the dean

‘of men. 

In addition, anote to the ef.
fect of the misuse of their of-
ﬁcial University credentials
will be placed in their perma-
nent personal ﬁles in the Of-
ﬁces of the Dean of Men and '
Women.

to try to determine which chil-
dren need spech corection. And
because the U.C.P.A. is pledged

to assist the cerebral palsied, he‘ *

said, youngsters suffering from
the handicap will naturally be
given preference to clinic services.’

Dean Biddle Celelirates
Twenty-fifth Year Here

THOMAS

. Gene Kelly, famed dancer and former director of Pitt’s
annual “Cap and Gown” production, used to take time off
from his directing to smile wryly at Pitt’s Dean Biddle and.
exclaim “Biddle, Biddle, always in the middle.” And as Mr.
Biddle completes his 25th year at the post of Dean of Men
he eralizes just how accurate Gene Kelly’s idiom was.

The dean explained that he is
always attempting a fusion of the
high goals of the university with
the student body. In his position
he is responsible for all aspects of

demic schedules.

But Mr.
chores “all fun—-—every day, real
satisfaction.” “I must be a peren-
nial student,” he explained, be-
cause I am always placing myself
in the center of the students’ com-

plex problems, endlessly seeking
the best solutions.” -
Reluctant to Leave

Dean Biddle was graduated from
this institution in 1929 in the ﬁeld
of business administration. How-
ever, he was reluctant to leave,

tation to ﬁll the vacancy of assist-
ant dean.

He was promoted to acting dean
in 1941, and the following year re-
ceived the title which he holds to-
day. 9

, Mr. Biddle considers his most
important function as Dean of Men
“to help create ,a good environment
for student work in all aspects and
to help students perform to the ex-
tent of their ability.” He believes
that physical facilities, colleagues,
and‘ teachers are necessary moti-
vation toward achieving these
goals.

“This is a terriﬁc institution,” he
beamed. “Absolutely terriﬁc.” He
thinks that the people who com-
prise the leadership and the back-
bone of the university work un-

student welfare, other than aca- ‘

Biddle considers his A

and delightedly accepted an invi- ‘

'f1aggingly with enthusiasm and

high purpose. He cited the pres-
ent building development as a re-
cent example.

A Mean Business
' So, also, is be impressed with the
Pitt students. He labels them as
an “I mean business” student body,
and is daily gratiﬁed to work with
young men with such high pur-
poses. V . S

The dean takes great delight in
Watching a ' student‘ d e v e 1 o p
through four years and then mak-
ing quiet predictions as to their
success or failure in later life. He
will not admit his percentage of
rights and wrongs.

As an undergraduate himself,
Dean Biddle 'held his fraternity
presidency and maintained the po-
sition of advertising manager —of
the Pitt News. The leader also
worked in the chairman spot dur-
ing spring festival.

He was the ﬁrst_ head of the

‘tuckshop initially maintained for

students during the depression, and
can recall selling two sandwiches
for 15 cents.
High Quality Students

Dean Biddle ﬁrmly believes that
today’s students are brighter and
of a better quality than those of
the class of- ’29. He is equally im-
pressed with the constantly in-
creasing quality of instruction at
Pitt.

The dean believes that “a period
of many years and a detachment
from Pitt are necessary to really

‘Student iL.ea'der-s Rate Over Wisconsin

Louden Made YMCA Head

The new head of the YMCA
has observed differences in lead-
ership qualities and Y life among
the students at the University of
Wisconsin and the University of
Pittsburgh. ‘

“I’r_n amazed,” said Mr. Alwyn
Louden, formerly associate sec-
retary of the YMCA at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin, “at the qual-

ity of the upperclassman leader— it

ship here at Pitt. To my way of

thinking, it’s a better quality of

leadership than at ‘Wisconsin.’’

Mr. Louden, who is now working
on his masters’ degree in Religious
Education at Pitt, obtained his
B. A. in Business Administration
from the University of Wisconsin.
After serving 41/2 years in the
service he was asked to work at
the Y in Wisconsin. He has found

that the YMCA at his former '

school is totally diﬁerent than at
Pitt because'it is centered in the
dorms, whereas at Pitt, the work
is done out of an office.

The new director also had much
to say about Freshman Camp
which was held last weekend: “_I
liked the interest and participa-
tion of the faculty members at
Fresh Camp. I feel that the faculty
is interested in student life as a
whole, and not only in academic
studies.” -

As far as interests for just him-
self go, Mr. Louden enjoys classi-
cal music, drama, and reading
about railroad history. In the
ﬁeld of sports, the new leader
favors swimming. .

Admission Tests
Required For Law
School Applicants

Law School Admission Tests,
required of applicants for admis-
sion to a number of leading Amer-

ican law schools, will be given at »

over 100 centers in the United
States on Nov. 13, 195-4, Feb. 19,
Apr. 23, and Aug. 6, 1955.
Candidates must make separate
application for admission to each
law school of his choice and
should inquire of each whether
to take the Law School Admission
Test and when. Many law schools
select their freshman classes in

‘the spring before their entrance,

therefore candidates for admis-
sion to next year’s classes are

‘advised to take either the Novem-

ber or the February test.

The test features objective
questions measuring verbal apti-
tudes and reasoning ability rather
than acquired data. Bulletins of
further information should be ob-
tained four-weeks ‘before desired
testing date from Law School Ad-
mission Test, Educational Testing

"Well. now. I thought it was odd they wanted to work
for nothing." ' . .

Complete Expansion   .

Pitt’s non professional students need no longer feel
slighted when building expansion is mentioned in connec-
tion with the University. It was a long time in making and
it will be some time before it is a reality, but the much dis-
cussed, long sought student union is past the dreaming
stage.

And “that ain’t all.” Dormitories for both men and wom-
en students are on the same agenda. - '

Complete plans for the dormitories and the student
union will be submitted to the University Board of Trus-
tees in the very near future by Chancellor R. H. Fitzgerald.
Within the space of a year, actual construction may be un-
derway. -

The announcement of these proposals may- shock some
‘StlIL..;‘l’ltS. To the majority it will come as something which
they consider long overdue. Unfortunately many students
failvto reﬁect on the various _aspects ofsuch a plan. All
such proposals‘ must work their way through devious and
intricate channels beforethey are transferred from thoughts
to paper. After plans have been drawn, further revision
must be impressed on them before they reach the higher
echelons.

When the crest has been reached and most of the crim-

son tape bypassed, the plans are presented to the Board of
Trustees. In most cases they suffer a quiet demise. Only the
best can possibly beapproved. The reason should be clear.
Its a simple Jnatter of money which, in these times, seems
headed ‘toward extinction.

The trustees, contrary to popular belief, hold the best

interests of the students uppermost. But they must look at-

a much greater span of time than the four years which any
of us spend at Pitt. If this pattern were not adhered to,
the lucky students who happened to be enrolled when the
trustees took oiﬁce would have many of thelthings they
desired in the line of construction while all future students

would get the sum total of nothing.

. Life -in a gold ﬁsh bowl may be ﬁne for some people
but those who write the checks can ill afford such luxury.

Pity the Frustrated Freshman . . ..»

Prob|ems—A|ways Problems

by Jim Deweese

Three years ago I, like this
year’s freshmen, had payed
my tuition and, in so doing,
had bought the right to call
myself a college man. I was
sure that I was a college man

because the girls wore soror-
ity pins and
this was the
only thing I
was sure of
until I saw a
girl wearing
a fraternity
pin. T h i s
problem 0 f
separa t i n g
t h e m e n
f r o m t h e-
w o m e n
threatened momentarily to

obscure all else but I was"

brought back to a state of
relative rationality with the
tolling of the bell.

iMy class ., in’ English com-
position semed, at the time,
an agreeable way to launch
the week. Within the con-
fusing space of a few. days
I decided that times had
changed. My instructor seem-
very nice and hastened to
make us feel at home. This
had to be done rapidly in
order to leave the remaining
49 minutes for an explana-
tion of the assignment.

Decomposition

Came the day on which we
were scheduled to receive
our ﬁrst themes back and
with it an irrepressable ﬂow
of conﬁdence. I had been a
pretty fair ‘English student
in High School and knew I
had nothing to worry about.
My D theme was returned
with enough red pencil
marks in the margins to
raise questions as? to the in-

 
 

 

structor’s loyalty. After class

I stepped into the hall and
lit a cigarette. I had never
smoked before but this seem-
ed like a good time to start.

Calculus was next on the
program so I loosened my
slide rule in its case, threw
my cigarette in the general
direction of my English in-
structor, coughed, and went
down to the Tuck Shop for
coffee. I didn’t drink coffee
either. We had been ﬁguring
the cross-sectional areas of
dam gates. Every time I
walked into class there was
a different sized dam gate

‘drawn on the black board.

These dam gates were get-
ting on my nerves.
Patiently Waiting’

I put out my cigarette, ﬁn-
ished my coffee, lit another
cigarette and went to eco-
nomics class. At this point
in- my schedule I had three
consecutive classes the ﬁrst
being economics. Then came
astronomy and ﬁnally psy-
chology. The economists
seem to spend most of their
time hunched over» graphs
and charts which tell what
man has been doing for the
past centuries. When they
get tired of hunching over
their graphs they sit back
and predict what will hap-
pen within the next century.
If they get good odds, they

place‘ bets. If not they just
sit back and wait to see‘if
they were correct.

The astronomers stay up
all night and sleep all day.

I woke my instructor up once "

to ask him for a light and he
told me that the sun was go-
ing to blow up in...,a few bil-
lion years and settle all the
earth’s problems in one fell
swoop. This worried me so’
I lit a cigarette and bought

a cup of coffee and a couple ‘

of doughnuts.
liked doughnuts.
Gradual Withdrawal
Psychology proved very
interestinguntil I began to
notice some ofthe things I
had always taken for grant-
ed but which the psycholo-
gist takes as abnormal. I
quit smoking and cut my
coffee back down to 10 cups
a day. I even had to quit eat-
ing "doughnuts. I ﬁnally had
to drop the course when I
began to take note of such
things as which shoe I put

I’ve always

"on ﬁrst in the morning.

I adopted anew philosopy
as a matter of personal sur-
vival and, by strict adher-
ence, have managed to stick
around in spite of the facul-
ty’s efforts on my behalf. It
goes something ' like this,
“Sometimes I think the
whole world is crazy save‘
thee and me and sometimes
I have my doubts . . .”

University of Minnesota football
squad, halfbacks Bob and Pink
McNamara.

This brother act exhibited per-

, fect harmony last week at Minne-

apolis Memorial Stadium, scoring‘
two out of three of their team’s
touchdowns in drumming Nebras-
ka, 19-7. ‘\ *
Older brother Bob McNamara is

.a 23-year old senior and three
year letterman who went unno-

ticed in the shadow of record set-
ting All-American Paul Giel last
year. However, a look at the rec-
ord shows his ability to lead the
band. This year’s captain, he was
the Gopher’s best ground gainer
last fall with an average of 4.8
yards per carry——a full yard bet-
ter than Giel.

One thing , the Pitt defense
might keep in mind about this

"right-half-back, he never ran the

ball across the goal line all last

‘ year. He was, however, the team’s

leading pass receiver, grabbing
115 tosses for 204 yards.
McNamara’s pass catching abil-
ity might be credited to his
freshman and sophomore years
when he played offensive end for

Wes Fesler’s single wing teams.‘

'-Mac, as he is called by his team-
mates, is also a defensive stand-
out having played safety man in
his first two‘ years, even with the

, two platoon system in effect.

McNamara is a little brother. in
every way except playing ability.

_‘Pinky is a sophomore two years

his frail 160 pound frame.

His speed so impressed the
coaching staifthat two-year let-
terman Dale Quist was moved to
the‘ quarterback post to make
room for the little McNamara. The
new varsity man was also a star
in high school where he scored
three touchdowns on runs of more
than ﬁfty yards in one game.

Our Panthers may feel they
will have their claws full with two
McNamaras to handle but they
should be thankful the whole clan
is not along. There are, at last
count anyhow, seven brothers and
cousins who have made the Mc-
Namara riame synonomous with
athletic prowess in Minnesota.

With Lewis out, and Jenkins‘,

‘Schierer, and Salvaterra on the

doubtful list, Pitt’s hopes of vic-
qtory seem slightly dimmed. Ac-
cording to the experts, however,
the Panthers are a three-point
favorite. The position of favorites
is a strange and surprising one
for the Jungle Cats, especially on
the heels of the 27-7 defeat hand-
led them by the Trojans last week.

Another tight situation could
develop at the quarterback post
manned by veteran signal-caller
Rudy Mattioli who has been. per-
forming on a knee still tender from
a recent operation. With Lewis
out, Dawson indicates that either
Jim Lenhart or Bill Amos will
spell Mattioli. -

Except for the possible change
at the fullback position, the Pitt
backﬁeld will remain the same,

tain‘ Henry Ford at the halves.

famous for the single wing un-

Warmath, switched its attack to

Football manpower at Pitt

opinion of many a supporter
of Pitt athletics in past years. The
Athleic Department, believing
they have found an answer to this
problem, has announced the for-
mation of a Junior Varsity foot-
ball. team for all students who
have a deﬁnite interest in play-
ing football.

ways room at the top,” newly ap'- ,

Second Straight Win Looms
For Harriers Against Covies

By STEVE BUTCHOK ‘ .

The Panther cross-country team will be host to Geneva
tomorrow morning as they attempt to make the Covies their
second straight victim at the Schenley Park course beginning

Under the superb guidance of Coach Carl Olson, the
boys have been steadily improving since last week’s opener
with Slippery Rock, and should be able to defeat the usually

tough outﬁt that the Covies come¢

the runners off onthe fast Schen
ley course. ‘

Coach Olson’s only comment on
the strength of the Covies is “they
will be tough. They always have
good material in which to mould
a top-flight outﬁt.”

That's as far as the coach would
go, and the keen competition
shown in practice for starting
‘berths in the Covie match re-
lates that the boys are bubbling
over with confidence in the an-
ticipation of another victory.

With this combination of assets,
the Panther harriers should regis-
ter their second triumph of the
season and extend their victory
strin-g to 11. , S

After the Geneva meet, the Pan-
ther thinclads take on another 10-
cal foe in Westminster ‘before
their strength will be put to the
supreme test against eastern pow-
ers .Vil1anova, Army, and Penn
