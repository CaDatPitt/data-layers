Students to vote
on changes to
SGB Constitution

Brett Sholtis
Staff Writer .

A committee met Monday to discuss pro-

. posed changes to the Student Government

Board Constitution.

Ten members of the Constitutional Re-
view Committee met at 2 p.m. in the SGB
conference room in the William Pitt Union
Monday afternoon. The committee, which
was formed last month, is led byjoseph Ko-
zak, chair of SGB’s Judicial Committee, and

is composed of representatives from student

organizations and other SGB committees.

Members of SGB’s.]udicial, Transporta-
tion and Safety, Governmental Relations and
Academic Affairs committees are represent-
ed on the Constitutional Review Committee,
which has 13 members including Kozak.

Representatives’ of campus organiza-
tions such as the Interfraternity Council, the
National Pan—Hellenic Council, the Rainbow
Alliance and the Asian Student Alliance also
serve on the committee.

Although committee members disagreed
over some details of the constitution’s word-
ing, nobody dissented with the essential
concepts.

Three main changes will be up for refer-
endum vote during the Nov. 21 SGB election.

Pitt dance competition supports free clinic

Kathleen Fennell
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

A young woman with a growing painful
mass on her leg recently came to a free
clinic where clinicians‘ determined the
mass was cancerous. '
Because of this revelation, the young
woman, who was a visiting student and
not a U.S. citizen, went on to get surgery

and undergo chemotherapy. Without
the free clinic, she may not have sought
medical care or would have had to pay
a hefty emergency room bill.

Mary Herbert, the clinical director at
the Birmingham Free Clinic in the South
Side, said this is one of her favorite sto-
ries about theclinic, which provides

, health care to uninsured patients. It
serves about 1,200 patients during a -

total of roughly 3,500 visits per year.
“The real goal is to break down bar-

riers for people to just get in, get care

and ‘get assessed for care,” Herbert said.

“It may not be that We can fix the thing .

or have a service on site, but our goal
is really to help patients.”
One way the clinic has managed to

SGB

One major change focuses on the voting
system, itself. In the current system, any
undergraduate student who is not part of
the College of General Studies may vote for

ﬁve SGB candidates and one presidential 1

candidate. _

Under the proposed revision, students
would only be able to vote for three SGB
candidates and one presidential candidate.

Most SGB candidates currently carri-
paign as members of slates.

A slate, according to Kozak, is a coalition
of people campajgningtogether, composed

of up to three members running for Board‘

positions or one presidential candidate and
two candidates for_th__eH Board.‘ Last year,

some slates paired up to campaigntogether._

These coalitions were commonly referred
to as “megaslates.”  '

According to Kozak, the current sys-
tem allows for two sister slates working
as a megaslate to monopolize the Board,
which has eight members in addition to
the president.

“Right now, six friends could always go
and run together and control SGB,” Kozak
said. ' ' - ‘

According to Robert Beecher, chair of
SGB’s Governmental Relations Committee,
this revision to the SGB Constitution will
prevent such monopolies in future elec-
tions.

“ [This change] creates a disincentive for
six people to work together and effectively
and systematically gets rid of the sister slate
system,” Beecher said._ ’

Another proposed change deals with
SGB members’ academic standards. Pres-
ently, SGB members must maintain a mini-
mum 2.5 grade point average. Under the
proposed change, Board members would
have to maintain a 2.75’ GPA.

According to Brandon Benjamin, presi- _

dent of the Rainbow Alliance, the change to
GPA—standards would place Pitt above the
standards set for student governments of
many other schools.

The third potential change that is up for
referendum concerns the wording of the

_ SGB Constitution’s preamble. According

to Gordon Louderback, S_GB president, this
change will make the constitution easier to
understand. ‘ _

He also said the constitution was due
for an update. .

“We don’t even have a date of the last
revision [in the constitution]. It’s about 
changing the document to better pertain
to the current students,” Louderback said.

William Engler, ajudicial Committee
member, said that the linguistic changes
will also make it easier for SGB to enforce
the laws.

“We talked about how this readability
is good for the student body,” Engler said.

CLINIC

Pitt student groups, which raised
$12,000 last year, Herbert said. _

More than $6,000 ofthis sum came
from Dhirana, an Indian classical dance
competition that drew teams from
schools all over the country.

A The second annual Dhirana compe-
tition will be held atPitt this February
to raise funds for the Birmingham Free
‘Clinic. .

The funds raised by Dhirana and oth-

er groups helped the clinic purchase a
new electrocardiogram machine, which
is used to monitor the heart’s electrical
activity. 1 A

Sushma Kola, a first-year student at
Pitt’s School of Medicine and co-direc-

tor of Dhi-rana 2014, said in an email
that the group deliberatelypicked the
Birmingham Free Clinic, rather than
adopting a national cause.

“We decided to choose the Birming-
ham Free Clinic as the official charity
after deciding that we really wanted to

‘ make a tangible difference in our own
community,” Kola said. I

Last year, teams from the Univer-
sity of Texas-Austin, Rutgers University,
Penn State University and the University
of Maryland competed at Dhirana.

Pitt’s Indian classical dance team,
Nrityamala, also performed.

The idea for the clinic came out of an
Oakland emergency room.

Tom O’Toole founded the clinic after
he served as a resident at UPMC Monte-
ﬁore about 20 years ago. While at Mon-
teﬁore, he noticed that many homeless

provide care is through support from

patients had no physicians to follow up
with after visits to ‘the hospital’s emer-
gency room.

Pitt’s Division of General Internal
Medicine and UPMC jointly operate

the clinic, which provides free health

services on Mondays, Wednesdays and
Saturdays to mostly low-income indi-
viduals who don’t have health insurance.

In addition to donations, the free
clinic also receives grants, including
some from the state government. Her-
bert said UPMC Monteﬁore also pro-
vides administrative support, including

' the space for Herbert’s ofﬁce.

Herbert said the facility began as
part of a walk—in clinic serving only
the homeless a few days a week at the
Salvation Army in South Side. But as it
grew in volunteers, operational hours
and services offered, the patient base

In the late 1990s and early 20005,
more patients who were not homeless
but were uninsured started using the
clinic. ‘ '

Herbert said she does not expect
most of the clinic’s patient base to ben-
efit from the availability of subsidized
health insurance under the Affordable

Care Act. The law does not provide sub-

sidies for health insurance to Ameri-
cans whose incomes fall below the fed-
eral poverty line, which is set at about
$11,500 a year for a single adult.
“Over half of our-patients‘ have no
income whatsoever, so we really see a
group of folks who are not going to be

. mandated to have insurance through

the Affordable Care Act,” Herbert said.

Some patients are not U.S. citizens
and will therefore not be able to pur-
chase subsidized insurance under the
act.

Surabhi Menon, a junior neuro-
science major and spokeswoman for
Dhirana, also has a fellowship at the
Birmingham Free Clinic at the social
services help desk.

There, Menon asks patients who
come to the clinic if they need help get-
ting food, clothes, housing or fulﬁlling
other basic needs. °

“If they do, I sit down with them and
I help them find certain resources like
food or clothing banks that they can be
connected to to improve their lives as a

Enjoy Halloween While you can

Sophia A1 Rasheed
Columnist

We’re two days from Halloween,
which means we’re only two days
from me ceasing to be excited about
the holiday. In actuality, I spend
more time talking up Halloween and
trying to get everyone on board with
an all-out costume showcase — in-
volving listening to “Monster Mash”
at least once — than I do actually
participating in Halloween. But that
seems.to follow the trend of most
holidays in American culture.
Most of my excitement stems
from the fact that] genuinely enjoy
seeing everyone be someone com-
pletely different for a night — why
doesn’t everyone see theftm in this?
But another main reason that I try
to make the most of the experience
is because —-— cue the world’s small-
est violin —~ my Catholic elemen-
tary school decided that it would
no longer allow costumes (starting
when I was in third grade) on this

beloved day of the year. Costumes‘

andcelebrations, they argued, in-

terfered with What was important ’

to the institution’s Values.

My mentality as a third grader
told me that the “important” com-
ponent of my school’s argument
meant more learning and less
fun. I probably didn’t atuibute the
school’s concerns to the religious
conflictbetween the afterlife impli-
cations of Halloween and Catholic
beliefs. The reason for this, as you
can probably imagine, is that I was
in third grade, and I was in it for
the candy and costumes, not the
religion, as is typically the case for
children. ‘ l

The arguments over the appro-

. priateness of ghosts and witches in

schools, both public and private,
have been ongoing because of pa-
rental concerns about connections
to Paganism. Yet parents are sim-
ply missing the point about what a
harmless holiday Halloween really
is, and they are setting a dangerous
precedent for educational institu-
tions to give the recognition of other
holidays a closer look.

In the recent, appropriately
titled Time article “From the De-
partment of Petty Controversies:

Schools Cancel Halloween,” stories
of schools in the Northeast area —
including two in Pennsylvania —
are highlighted for their success in
banning Halloween celebrations.

. Columnist Nick Gillespie points

out that the concerns range from

safety to fearing a lack of separation

between church and state.
Whatever the reason, an increas-

ing amount of parents from various .
religious and secular backgrounds -

have agreed that Halloween causes
more harmthan good, and they are
moving to banany celebration of it
in schools.

I don’t know what has happened
in the decades since parents attend-
ed elementary school, but when I at-
tended school, there was no portion
during our Halloween celebration
that included a disclosure about the
myths of the undead or about any
religious factors whatsoever. As I
mentioned before, the only thing
on the agenda was to dress up in
costume, receive candy without
even saying please and associate a

month with orange and black.

Before more schools move to ban such
activity, I challenge parents to prove that their
children have been signiﬁcantly impacted by
Halloween in any other way besides calorie
intake and enjoying one of the most fun (lays
of the year. A

Inthis case, it seems that parents are more
concerned with ruining fun than promot-
ing safety or actually advocating an agenda,

whether secular or religious, in their hopes
of canceling Halloween altogether: Perhaps
their reasoning would be more believable if
Halloween was the most signiﬁcant holiday

standing in the way of a completely church— .

and-state-separated school system, but this is
hardly the case. If parents are willing to argue
for a more secular agenda, are we willing to ig-

nore the factthatwinterbreak is conveniently -

°centered around the Christmas season? Or
perhaps more realistically, are they willing
to refrain from displaying any sort of red and
green to commemorate that time of year‘?
Of course not, because we should under-
stand that sometimes there is some good that

comes from refraining from a completely
secular school system. In this case, that good is
the genuine joy that teachers and parents gain
from the “holiday” season. There are many
students who are subject to talk of Christmas

_ and Easter and Lent and choose not to ex-

press concern over whether it conflicts with
their religious beliefs because it seems so un-
necessary to speak badly of something that
causes everyone so much joy and is already so
ingrained in the system. It’s just not realistic
to believe that a culture that hopes to keep

minority, who has had no issue with the way ,
that schools cater to aChr_istian belief system
(I don’t think enjoying cookies and Chrisnnas
lighting around December harms anyone),
I think it’s possible for parents to be a little

' more ﬂexible in what they allow in schools.

church and state separate will do soéin light

of a majority Christian nation.
Speakingas someone ofthe non— Christian

lf the Christmas holiday season — which
embodies much deeper implications and a
more intense form of celebration —— remains
unscathed, despite the fact that many who
subject to the display of celebration may not
partake in the beliefs, the least we can allow
is that the less harmﬁiland way more ﬁm cel-
ebrations, suchas Halloween, remain, as well.

r. Do’s Scott McMicken discusses the creation of B-Room

Emma Kilcup
Stcyj“ - Wrz’ter

The Philly-based band Dr. Dog released
its eighth album, B-Room, on Oct. 1. The
band will kick off its fall tour at Stage AE
in Pittsburgh on Nov. 1.

Scott McMicken began singing and
playing guitar with fellow bandmate
Toby Leaman in eighth grade. While other
members of the band have come and gone,
McMicken and Leaman have remained
loyal since 1999 —-— with just as much mo-
mentum. »

The Pitt News: I know that the new
album is different than your older stufl'——
more stripped—down and simpler. Was this
an organic move to make these changes or
a decisive moment when you chose to do
this kind of album?

Scott McMicken: ‘I don’t know what
the general thinking is of what goes into
how music is made, but everything is con-
scious. It’s kind of a combination. The
band’s aesthetic gebbs and ﬂows with the
taste of those involved. When it comes
time to record, you need to focus, and in
order to focus, you end up talking about
things: what’s exciting," what challenges
you want to present yourself with. It’s a
mix of organic and conscious decisions.

TPN: How do you think, in general,
people have been reacting to the newest
album from what you’ve heard so far?

SM: I think critically this album has not
done great, but a lot of that comes down
to the fact that we’ve been around for a
long time and it’s getting complicated.
Our musical history is so insular and self-
governed that I just don’t think there are

a

a lot of journalists who know how to talk
about something that broad.
TPN_: To‘ make your latest album you

‘converted an old silver mill and it was a

huge chjange. How did you guys end up
doing this? How did you choose the mill?

SM: It seemed like settling at the time.
We couldn’t ﬁnd what we wanted, so we
had to take this. At the end of the day, it

_ turned out to be way cooler than we ever

imagined it. We spent a month and a half
converting it from a ﬁlthy box into the
coolest studio environment. We worked
just as hard doing that, day in, day out,
seven days a week, 16, 18 hour days for
more than a month, and then [we] started
recording. '

TPN: The album is titled B-Room. Does
that refer to the mill studio?

SM: Yes, it refers to a part of it. The

mill itself is kind of a big compound at
this point. It was a big open room and
we turned it into a lot of different rooms.
There’s the main recording room in the
center that’s a big proper studio and then
the whole perimeter of the place is bed-
rooms and shops and stuff like that.

In the corner, tucked away from every-
thing, probably the room you’re least likely
to go in if you’re walking around there is
the B—room. It was just a lower-key record-
ing area, a kind of room a band has been
living with their entire lives. And it became
very signiﬁcant in a lot of ways — at the
same time  evolving song depth and song
structure and wanting to tackle more in the
recording process, and holding onto the
context that we all feel so comfortable in
in our own skin, which is what the B-room
represents. I

For Allison Hilkert, the general manager of the

BRGR food truck, food on the go isn’t a term _

reserved for her busy customers.

The newest craze to hit Pittsburgh is the
food truck, an on—the-go restaurant parked
on the street that serves both full meals and
snacks. Food trucks have been popularized
by the Food Network show “The Great Food
Truck Race,” and the stationary food trucks
located next to Soldiers 8: Sailors Memorial
Hall have been a staple of student life at Pitt
for years. '

Now, however, food trucks are popping
up all over the city.

“The mobility of food trucks are great,” A

Hilkert said, “We can go to sporting events in
the city, catering events and private events, as
well as different public festivals that are going
on that a normal restaurant wouldn’t have the
opportunity to go to.”

BRGR’s food truck is just one of many that

now operate in Pittsburgh. With two formal
restaurant locations in downtown Pittsburgh
and Cranberry Township, Pa., the establish-
ment recently decided to add a mobile version

‘to its repertoire.

“We don’t have the room to do as extensive
a menu as our restaurant, but We do our most
popular burgers, as well as aburger of the day

and a shake of the day,” Hilkert said. “We also .

offer chogolate andvanilla shakes, fries, chips
and cole slaw.”

The most advantageous aspect of food,
trucks are their ability to move around, serv-

. ing hungry customers on the go. Food trucks

can be found all over the city in various loca-
tions.

“Our normal spot is on Forbes and Grant
[streets], but we are also going to start going
to Washington’s Landing at least once aweek,”
said Hilkert. “We use Twitter extensively to
notify our customers of our location, though.”

Social media plays a huge role in the suc-
cess of food trucks. From tweeting locations to
interacting with customers, food truck own-

‘Venus’ vividly recounts a historic tale of exploitation

Matt Singer
Suﬁ Wrz'ter

“Venus”

Cathedral of Learning
Studio Theater
Through Nov. .tO y
Admissior1,:p$_y15—$2’i5

 

We ﬁrst see the Venus Hottentot under dim
lighting and with a ﬂock of spectators cir-
cling her like vultures and hurling insults.
And although the annular chorus declares
her to be dead, it’s hard to believe —- she’s
right in front of us, after all. It isn’t until

 the Venus Hottentot herself says that she’s

"L;-, dead that we start to believe it: It’s some-
i  thing in her voice that makes it believable,
 a modesty that makes the sinking statement

sound real.
Thus starts Suzan+Lori Parks’ “Venus,”

which Pitt’s Theatre Arts Department is '

performing until Nov. 10. Directed by Cyn-
thia Croot, this rendition of Parks’ work
conveys the powerful gravity of the plight
of the Venus Hottentot, the stage name of

H the ﬁctional Sarah Baartman.

Baartman is convinced through dubious
means to leave her life as a slave in South
Africa and go to England to be a performer.
However, the ﬁne print actually says that
she’ll be a freak show presentation. Hope-
ﬁll and willing, she embarks on a trip to
England, where she expects stardom to be
waiting for her.

Baartman’s tale is, at face value, an uphill
battle in which she tries to “make her mint”

solthat she may return to her home in South '

Africa with enough money to live a decent
life. And with Bria Walker playing Baartman,
we want her to ﬁnd that happiness.
Walker’s performance succeeds because
of the modesty that she brings to her charac-
ter. She oscillates between a contained sense
of optimism and forlorn desperation. Al-
though a transition between these emotions
— which sit at opposite poles — should be

abrasive, Walker’s transitions are smooth.
When she cries and gasps in pain after be-
ing poked, prodded and kicked, the sounds
come out as if screamed through a pillow.
This doesn’t nullify the audience’s sense
of pity for her. Rather, it galvanizes it. __ p
This is most clearly demonstrated in the

scene in which the Venus ‘Hottentot threat-3 A
ens to leave if she does not receive better

pay for her participation in the freakshow.
Mother Showman taunts her and deprives
her of any sort of humanity, clearly spelling
out that the Venus Hottentot is a freak, an
“it,” and has no place in the society that
pays money to rubberneck at her. Yet when
the Venus Hottentot falls to the ground in
desperation, Mother Showman asks her
softly, in a seemingly loving voice so keenly

veiled withulterior motives, “You’d walk out
on ya mother?”

Enter Terry Hardcastle as the Baron
Docteur, a Frenchman who purchases the
Venus Hottentot for scientiﬁc examination.
The Docteur’s fascination with the creature
blurs the lines between scientiﬁc pursuit

comes from the convenience, as well as the
fact that they’re feet away from the kitchen
where their food is being made.

“Food trucks in general are appealing
because you get to see the food being made,
it’s often quick while on the go and usually
tastes pretty good,” said Aditya Thawardas,
a sophomore at Pitt.

Although the mobility of food trucks af-
fords them with many advantages, the trucks
also face anumber of challenges posed by reg-
ulations, including prohibitions on parking
in metered spots‘ and parking in one location

Code of Ordinances, it states that, “no peddler

in one (1) location. Upon the expiration of the
ﬁfteen (15) minutes, the peddler must begin
moving to a location at least two—hundrédﬁfty
(250) feet from the ﬁrst location.” This is the
major issue mobile food trucks face.

“It hasn’t been easy,” Hilkert said. “We’ve
been having to find private lots that we rent to
vend, or our festivals that we go to have to be
off the public streets; We do have a vendor’s
license, but you can’t just pull up on thestreet
and vend freely.” ' .

The obstacles these mobile restaurants

face haven’t stopped the trucks’ growth in
popularity or the positive attitudes food truck
drivers have about their businesses.

“The Pittsburgh food truck scene has

changed very rapidly. There are tons more ’

food trucks coming into the Pittsburgh area
now,” saidjay Amin, an owner of the mainstay
India on Wheels food truck located on Bigelow
Avenue in Oakland. “The word spreads really,
really fast. The clientele and the word‘-spread-
ing really motivates us and keeps us going, and

that’s ahuge part of the food truck business.” I

liberates her from her freal<show lifestyle, he

 

. subjugates her ,to objectification and uses her

to release his repressed desires for/— exoticism.

The exact conditions that lead up to the
Venus Hottentot’s death are best left to the
performers to reveal, but it should be noted

that Simmons returns to the stage to play

another character: the “grade school chum”
who convinces the Baron Docteur to aban-
don his sexual deviance.

Simmons’ excellent performance as the
grade school chum, in addition to that seen
in her other roles, speaks to the relationship
that propels the story forward and keeps us

engaged. T ,
If “Venus” is to be looked at as a tragic

story of pain and loss, Walker is the afflicted _

and Simmons is the depriver. The entire story
would have fallen ﬂat without powerhouse
performances from the actors assigned to
these roles.

The stiﬂed modesty that Walker brings to
her role juxtaposed against the performances
of Simmons and Hardcastle make this rendi-
tion of “Venus” satisfyingly heart—wrenching.

Pro Panthers
imake little
noise in NF L’s  
Week 8

Sean Corrado
Stcyf/' Wrz'ter

The former Panthers in the NFL are no longer 2

. delivering the highlight performances that

fans are used to watching every Sunday, and
week eight only brought more mediocrity from
the Pitt alumni. .

Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry
Fitzgerald (Pitt 2002-2003) still is struggling
to get back to 100 percent after a hamstring
injury ﬁrst bothered him in the third.week of
the season. Fitzgerald was a game-time deci-
sion for the ﬁfth straight week last Sunday
against the Falcons.

Despite his injury, Fitzgerald, who has not

‘missed a game yet this season, managed to

jump start the Cardinals’ offense with a10-yard
touchdown reception early in the second quar-
ter. Arizona scored a season—high 27 points
and held the Falcons to only 13 points to earn
its fourth win of the season.

Fitzgerald ﬁnished with four catches for
48 yards and a touchdown.

The Cardinals are on a bye next week,
which will give Fitzgerald more time to pre-
pare his injured hamstring for a tough battle
with the Houston Texans in week 10.

That is, however, only if the Cardinals’ all-
time leading receiver stays in Arizona. ESPN’s
NFL insider Adam Schefter reported Sunday
afternoon that Fitzgerald could be moved prior
to the Oct. 29 trade deadline.

Running back Lesean McCoy (Pitt 2007-
2008) and his Philadelphia Eagles could not
move the ball against the New York Giants.
McCoy tallied only 48 yards on 15 carries and
four catches for 18 yards. The Eagles managed
only a defensive touchdown in the 15-7 loss.

- McCoy still leads the race for the rushing
title with 733 yards, yet his lead dwindled down

Pitt’s secondary helped prevent Navy from breaking off -many big runs Saturday. Ben Brownlee | Senior Staff Photographer

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pittbegarianotherweek ofpreparation Mon-
day before the Panthers head to‘ Atlanta, Ga.,
this weekend for an ACC bout against the

GeorgiaTechYellowjackets.Head'coachPaul _

Chryst’s team enters the week off a 24-21 loss
to Navy that Chryst said was obviously “dis-
appointing.” 2

“After watching the tape, I believe our
guys played hard and put it out there,” Chryst
said. “But we certainly didn’t do enough to
win the game.”

Pitt (4-3, 2-2 ACC) held Navy’s patented
triple-option offense in check for most of
Saturday’s game, but the Midshipmen scored
10 unanswered points inthe ﬁnal six minutes
to notch a comeback victory.

Pitt led Navy 13-7 at halftime, and Chryst
acknowledged Saturday the defense may have
been fatigued in the fourth quarter. Chryst
said he didn’t “sense” the defensive unit was
overconﬁdent entering the second half.

But if the Panthers were overconﬁdent,
Chryst placed the blame on his shoulders.

‘‘I’ve got to do a much better j ob of coach-
ing, because for any team to become com-
placent or overconﬁdent in a game, that’s on
me,” Chryst said. “I think genuine conﬁdence
doesn’t result in overconﬁdence. Respecting
the game will never let you become compla-
cent in a game.” ‘ '

This week, Pitt’s matchup with Georgia
Tech (5-3, 4-2 ACC) pits two Coastal Division
foes against one another in the Yellowjackets’
Homecoming game. Like N avy, Georgia Tech
also runs out of a triple-option base offense.

Complacency against the Yellowjackets
will get the Panthers nowhere ﬁirther than
it did against the Midshipmen, as Georgia
Tech’s offensive execution likely poses a much
stiffer test for the Pitt defense than Navy’s
offense did.» _

Georgia Tech brings the nation’s fourth-
ranked rushing offense to the table -—- the Yel-
lowjackets rack up an average of more than
315 yards per game. The running game has
propelled Georgia Tech’s offense to a scoring
average of 35.9 points per game, which ranks
No. 35 in the country.

“There’s no doubt they’re explosive, fast

on offense and play really fast on defense,”
Chryst said. “It will be a good challenge for
us.” -

Four Yellowjackets have already recorded
350 rushing yards or more this season, and
the team is led by David Sims. Sims has rushed
ateam-high 96 times fdr 516 yards and eight

. touchdowns.

1 Behind Sims is Robert Godhigh, who leads
all ACC players with 10.7 yards gained per
play. Godhigh has carried 36 times in 2013
for 384 yards and one touchdown.

Like Navy, Georgia Tech also has a quarter-
back who threatens from both land and air in
Vad Lee. Navy signal-caller Keenan Reynolds
didn’t gash Pitt’s defense as he did others,
but he did ‘play a role in two of Navy’s three
touchdowns Saturday.

“He’ssimilar [to Reynolds] in a sense that
you truly have to account for him, and he can
hurt you,” Chryst said. “A couple of games I’ve
seen of him, and he’s made a couple of very
good throws, but he’s a good player.”

Lee, himself, has run for 350 yards

to 64 yards over Seattle’s Marshawn Lynch.
McCoy, who has not scored in four weeks,
has seen his performance fall dramatically
in October, along with the rest of the Phila-
delphia offense.

If the Eagles cannot turn things around in

November, McCoy will lose his lead in rushing A

and scored six touchdownson the ground.
Through the air, Lee has tossed for another
eight touchdowns, completing 47 of 104 at-
tempts this season for 921 total yards.

In addition to an explosive offense, Georgia

Tech also ranks No. 21 among all Division 1-
teams in scoring defense at 19.9 points allowed

per game. The Yellowjackets have pitched a

pair of shutouts this season and allowed more -

than 20 points to their opposition just twice
this season.

Overall, Georgia Tech boasts the confer-
ence’s third-best defense at 342.2 yards al-
lowed per game.

“Up front, they’re active and they play
fast,” Chryst said. “They’ll hityou and their
secondary plays  conﬁdence. Part of that
is because they have some guys up front that
can put some heat on you fast.”

Senior defensive back Jemea Thomas is
one of those players in the secondary. Thom-

as earned Second Team All—ACC honors last.

season. Ia-Ie leads the Yellowjackets with 44
tackles and has broken up a team-high seven
pass attempts this season.

Beyond Thomas, a trio of Yellow Jackets
have each picked off two passes to constitute

most of the team’s nine total interceptions ‘

this year. Up front, Jeremiah Attaochu leads
the teamwith four sacks, followed by Adam
Gotsis’ three.

Pressure up front has been an issue for the
Pitt offense, which has struggled in recent
weeks following its 58-point outburst against
Duke. Pitt allowed just one sack at Navy, but it
was one that crippled the Panthers’ chances
of driving for the go—ahead touchdown late
Saturday.

“The one sack we gave up, we ended up
being in the wrong protection,” Chryst said.

“They were on him a little sooner than an-

ticipated.”

While Pitt quarterback Tom Savage was
sacked just once, he faced a good deal of pres-
sure, which forced him to seven rushing at-
tempts after dropping back to pass. Beyond
the scrambles, though, Chryst thought he saw
improvement from his quarterback a week
after Savage passed for just 104,yards against
Old Dominion. -

“I think he got off some reads and pro-
gressed through them,” Chryst said. “I think
he’s in a good state now. I’m not saying he’s
perfect, but I think he’s good.” I -
