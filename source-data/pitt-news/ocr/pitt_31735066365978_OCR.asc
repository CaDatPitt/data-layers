Search Committee Seeks

Masoner Replacement

by CHUCK STEEBER

The dean ‘of the School of Ed-
ucation, Dr. Paul H. Masoner, will
retire in September of the coming
school term. Hopefully a replace-
ment for the dean will be picked
by that time. '

In charge of the task of select-
ing the new dean, is Dr. Barbara
Newell, associate provost for
Graduatestudies and Research.
She is the chairman of the Educa-
tion Search Committee, which is
made up of 23 alumni, School of
Education faculty, educators
from the area, students, and fac-

ulty from other departments of-

the University.

Some of the members of the
committee are Dr. Roland
Barnes, professor of Education;
Dr. Jack Mattews, professor of
Speech; Dr. Louis Kishkunas, su-
perintendent of Pittsburgh public

schools; and Dr. Rae Siporin, as-r

sistant dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences.

The committee was formed in
Marchgandfhas been meeting reg-
ularly since then. There has been
two days of open’ hearings in that
time.

The open hearings were widely
publicized and as many as 5,000
invitations were sent» to members
of the community. People such-as
high school students, parents,
teachers,’ superintents and’ mem-

bers of the School of Education *

faculty were asked to come and
state their views on the subject of
the new dean.

The open hearings were held in
order to get input from the com-
munity and the faculty so a list of
desired characteristics could be
compiled. It will be on this cri-
terion that the new dean will be

selected.

‘The characteristics that were
compiled were broken down into
two categories, personal and ad-
ministrative.

The personal traits are: I.
Relate well with people of diverse
life styles; 2. Understand urban
problems; 3. Understand poten-
tial scope of School of Education,
i.e. research, community activ-

ities; 4. Willing to transcend per- _

sonal interests to further goals of
School of Education as a whole; 5.
Ability to work with various ‘peo-
ple with-an open mind; 6. Willing

to challenge existing procedures

and people who do not fulfill obli-
gations; 7. Concerned with qual-

ity education; 8. Commitment to
humanization of education; 9.
Willing to get involved with com-
munity, determination to improve
and develop cooperative endeav-
ors with community agencies,

Committed to affirmative action
for blacks and women; 12. Pos-
sess fortitude, political savy,

The committee is also looking
for several good administrative;
traits, these being: 1. Innovator
and guide; 2.’ Initaitor of change;
3. Ability to bring people togeth-
er; 4. ‘Proven ability to take _ac-
tion and get results; ?5. Coordina- -
tion, organization abilities; 6.

ority. ,

The committee has at this time
110 individuals to consider. These
names come from all over the na-
tion and have been nominated by
people on the committee and from
outside sources. Several candi-
dates have filed anjapplication for
the post. Dr. Newell pointed out
that the committee will continue’
to consider new candidates and
would be glad for any other nom-
inations.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi-

- the surprise resignation of Treas-

under circumstances that did
nothing to dispel rumors Connally
might join him on the 1972 Repub-

Standing before newsmen at the
White House, the chief executive
and the only Democratic member
of his Cabinet ‘were lavish in
praising each other. Then Nixon

Nixon said he will nominate

Pulitzer Prize Winner Discusses Book

by DEBBIE POPP
Staff Writer

“All sorrows can be bornif you
put them into a story or tell about
them in a tale," stated Dr. N.
Scott Momaday ashe addressed
the Ralph Munn Creative Writers’
Night at Carnegie Lecture Hall
Monday evening.

Dr. Momaday, a Kiewa Indian,
is the winner of the-1969 Pultizer
Prize for Fiction for his book,
House Made of Dawn, a novel
about a modern day Indian’s
struggle. He is currently a Eng-
lish professor at the University of
California a-t Santa Barbara.

In the role of traditional story-
teller, Dr. Momaday related the
meaning of several Kiowa and
Navajo myths-and legends and the
forceof language to the audience
of journalists, poets, writers, and
students. «

“Language is the moral act of
imagination that lends under-'

I standing to and of the immediate

world,” asserted Dr.‘Momaday.

It was such imagination of

.meaning spread in the oral tradi-

tion of tales that sustained the
Kiowa Indians through the de-

_cline of their culture and which

exemplifies the force of language.

On November 13, 1833, a camp,

of Kiowas witnessed a storm of
‘meteorites. In the sterile light of
these-falling stars, the Kiowas
impressed fashioned an image

' of themselves. .
The falling stars and their tale’.

gave a meaning to the Kiowa des-
tiny. That act of imagination let

them bear the destruction of half '

of their children by cholorea and
European diseases and endure the
harassement of. the new nation’ of
white. 4

David E. Epperson, who was
appointed dean of the University’s
Schoolof Social Work in Novem-

ber, 1971, will assume his duties .

immediately. Postponement of
the effective date of the appoint-
ment was made to allow Epper-
son to continue work on his Ph.D.
in Pitt’s Department of Political
Science. I

Epperson, formerly executive
director of Community Action
Pittsburgh (CAP), succeeds Dr.
William H. McCullough, who re-

‘signed from the deanship in De-

cember, 1970, to resume teaching
and research. Morton Coleman.
associate professor of social
work, has been serving as acting
dean since that time.

Epperson holds three degrees
from Pitt: a B.A. in political sci-
ence, an M.A. in political science,
and a master’s of social work. He
also has studied at the University
of California at Riverside; Robert
College in Istanbul, Turkey; and
the Chinese University of Hong
Kong. -

His experience in social work

and urban affairs goes back to the '

early 1960s,, when he served as a

After all, they felt their suffer-
ing was not meaningless. Imagin-
ation super-imposed on the his-

Language in the ceremonial

songs and chants of the American _

Indians brought an awareness of
their physical world. Through ex-
pressed ideas, they comprehend-

and respected ‘it. The Navajo

attitudes. ' . _

The word to the American In-
dian was conceived as an entity
superior to gods. Language in the
voice of the storyteller or chanter
was in the precarious position of

defining reality, designating the ‘a

.‘ 1 WASHINGTON (AP) — The bul-
 lets that wounded Gov. George C.
', Wallace Monday may lead to the
' beginning of a new surge in his
kind of Democratic protest pol-
" itics. ’

For Wallace, wounded and a
martyr to his cause, looms far
 more formidible than did Wallace
the would-be power broker.

When, if ever, Wallace will be
I’ able to resume his personal cam-
paign was not known.

4

A :',-,Ij,»he cannot, it is likely another
chaﬁipion will step forward as his
successor or his stand-iii, to at-
tempt to hold together the move-
ment and the support Wallace has
won.

For’ it was evident even in the
hours, after the shooting that the
,_ protest movement Wallace fash-
 ioned and represented would not
go away for lack of the active
campaigning of its leader.

, There is no obvious _standard
 bearer to step in for Wallace.

_ No Democratic campaigner

could pull the kind of crowds Wal-
~/lace mustered as he hunted pri-
; - mary votes.

Bullets Make Wallace. Martyr   .

There were about 1.000 people
at the Laurel, Md., shopping cen-
ter rally when the gunman struck.
From the beginning only Wallace
among the Democrats could as-
semble that kind of weekday turn-
out.

But the personality of a cam-
paign successor to Wallace is
less important than the symbol-
ism; the likelihood that someone,
probably someone with a South-
ern accent, would take up in be-
half of Wallace the protest stan-
dard of the Democratic right.

The Alabama governor was shot

on the eve of an election day that-

appeared likely to represent the
peak of his showings in the 1972
Democratic primaries.

He was favored to win in both
Maryland, where he was cam-
paigning. and in Michigan. He
seems certain to win both.pri-
maries now, helped by a possibly
strong sympathy factor.

In the process, he will gain a
hefty bloc of nominating votes to
go with the 210 already commit-
ted to him. ' -

Beyond those two states. \Wal-
lace really had no place to go in
the primaries—before Monday‘

HELP

In the near future the Pitt News will bd covering such stories as:
—An interview with presidential advisor Dahi Moynihan
-The Rolling Stones Concert ' E

-The Three Rivers Arts Festival

-The hearings of the State Senate Appropriations Committee on the budget of the University

—A proposed bill that would outlaw term papger research firms
—Various anti-war protests

\

Contests like those in Oregon and
Rhode Island on May 23 could hold
no encouragement for the Ala-
bamian.

But his name is on the ballot in
both states. \

He is not on the California bal-
lot, although he had talked of a
write-in campaign for that June
6 primary. Wallace wouldn’t have

had a chance of winning, and the,

winner there takes all 271 dele-
gates votes.

Some of the delegates commit-

_ted to him by his primary vic-

tories in Florida, Tennessee and
North Carolina didn’twant to vote
for Wallace. It will be far more
difficult now for them to ignore
their commitments to a felled
campaigner.

Exactly what Walla/ce had hoped /

to accomplish with his bloc of
delegates had never been clear.
He had taken to saying he had a
real chance at the nomination: in
fact. given the makeup of the
Democratic Party. he did not.

But Wallace also talked of in-
fluencing the course of the party.
pushing its platform -toward his
views on such matters as school
busing. - - *

HARRISBURG. Pa. (API—Former U.S. Atty._ Gen Ramsey Clark
and charged the government with prosecuting Rev. Philip Berrigan
aof six others for antiwar activities because it “really wanted to get

these people.”

“Their motive was discriminatory prosecution.” Clark said dur-

ing a post-trial hearing.

Clark was trying to get U.S. District Judge R. Dixon Hermah to
overturn the jury convictions of Father Berrigan and Sister Eliza-
beth McAlister for smuggling letters in and out of the Lewisburg

Pa., federal prison in 1970.

The jury, however, had failed to reach a verdict on other charges

On Monday. Herman took under_advisement defense arguments
to throw out the smuggling convictions. The defense contended the
government hasn‘t enforced prison smuggling statutes in the past.

Clark today argued the gov"-Mment had no intention of prose_-

cutting the seven defendants until

-. late FBI director, J. _Edgar

Hoover, issued a news release about the alleged anti-war plots on Nov.

27, 1970.

Until then, Clark said. the FBI had directed its efforts.against-

Father Berrigans beother. the Rev. Daniel Berrigan. whom the gov-
ernment was trying to capture for separate anti-war activities. Fath-
er Daniel Berrigan originally was named as a co-conspirator in the
Harrisburg case but was never named a defendant.

'Cant0ns'ville Nine’ Rocks Conscience

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD ‘

The Trial of the Catonsville
Nine by Daniel Berrigan is a dra-
ma based on the court records
of the trial that followed the sei-
zure and burning of selective ser-
vice files by Fathers Daniel and
Phillip Berrigan and seven oth-
ers in Catonsville. Maryland.

The moving play takes place
entirely in a courtroom with the
presentations of all nine defen-
dents on their involvement in the
incident.

The play very effectively brings
to light the conflict between
moral and civil law—the duty of a
citizen to act and the consequen-

ces he must be willing to pay for

his action.

An outstanding performance by
David Crawford portraying the
restrained agitation of Father
Daniel Berrigan, character-nar-
rator of the play, ties together
the phases of testimony and pre-
faced the play. With his haunt-
ing likeness to Berrigan, Craw-
ford is emotional yet constrain-
ed as the figurehead of the dra-
ma.

Characterization is remarkably
good.,,especially G. Edward Wil-

“Something strange has hap-
pened. An unusual recording by
a relatively unknown artist has
made it big on Top 40 radio. I am
referring to “American Pie" by
Don Mcllean.

Now that's not really the
strange part. What is strange is
that many supposedly aware
people have condemned the
record as being top 40 shit!

I object!

I would ask these dilletantes.
some of whom have inclignantly
and pedanticall_v complained to a
WZMI7 morning jockey about his
playing the record. to listen with
awareness-and sensitivity to the
whole recording. .

l.et McI.ean speak of the day
“l\«‘Iusie“ died. The “lylusic” of
another ago. An age when it was
so very good and easy not to have
to think too deeply. Yesterday.
when your troubles seemed far
away. Allow lVlcI,ean to outline

for you as no history teacher ever

has, the events that brought us
where we are today. . . the demise
of Elvis. the incredible influence
of the Beatles. the assasination of
President Kennedy. the Demo-
cratic convention of 1968. the
passing of Janis Joplin and all

’ that meant. the inauguration of

President Nixon, and the moon
flights . . . to mention just a few.

After that first big step, listen
to Mcllearrs “American Pie"
album! MeI.ean shows himself to
be not only a wonderful musician
but an intensely beautiful poet.

One cut. “Vincent? says all ,
there is to know about the genius
that was Vincent Van Gogh. Mind
you, Don McLean does not write
song lyrics but poetry. McLean's
‘story of Van Coghis struggle with
himself and with an ‘audience
which was not yet ready to even
tolerate him fills the listener with
rage and pity. ‘

I find very, very little of any
re.al value in the wide world of
art. Don McI.ean is an exception.
In the midst of a thousand heroic
attempts. Mel.ean has made it.
Not since Dylan have I been so
excited about a poet—musician.

There were no sequin gowns.

John of Paris. No top hats. No
tails. Not a single cummerbund
in the crowd. The only semblance
of formal atfire was the top half
of a crushed black velvet "tux
worn by a bearded (young)
man sporting a windblown shag. ’

Guthrie and his entourage
‘didn’t arrive ‘til 6:20 and it takes
awhile to set up in the symphony’s

' wake. Theconcert was scheduled

to begin at 7:30 so naturally the
doors didn’t open until 7:45 when
we all surged forward like a flock
ofVMarket Square pigeons after
a piece "of broad. T

I found my seat with the help
of a so_ft-spoken lady in gray and
gazed in awe at the resplendent
interior surround-ing me.

As the lights dimmed. the rela-
tively hushed mummerings (for
a crowd of this sort) quieted and
out walked Arlo accompanied by,
a quartet of unfamiliar faces.
Guthrie deciped not to mention
their names throughout the con-
cert (after hearing them I can‘t
say I blame him).

I asked around until I found
out that they are a group called
Swampwater. I later decided The
Blah Band was a far more fitting
title. They have one album out of
their own on RCA, Arlo wrote
the liner notes. Before they took
up with Arlo in 1971 they were
playing behind Linda Runstadt
(probably way behind).

The show opened with a sub-
dued version of an old Jim Kwe-
skin hit, “Ukelele Lady.” I won-
dered why theback-up boys were
whispering in theirmikes. I knew
that our hall is supposedly bet-
ter suited accoustically than even
the home of the Boston symph-
ony, but this was ridiculous.

Then we were treated to our

of our law enforcement agencies)

The fans in the Garden had to

pay $7.50 to sit 50 yards away. A

For $2.50, though, we were 15

better. The excitement of being
at a concert is still there.
There were no fragrant fumes
drifting slowly down) from the
upper balconies‘ (though about
half the audience had obviously
had a few quick drags before they
came into the theatre); no hassles
from over those in the cheapo-
cheapo seats rushing the stage
and blocking our view; nor were
we forced to endure an unbear-
able volume of unbalanced sound.

Instead, in the semi-sterile at-
mosphere of the theatre (cloud-
ed only -by the distracting know-

ledge of the ’half—naked nymphs’

on the ceiling about (What are
they doing there?) we sat and
calmly freaked out over such tri-

which le it I o and half
minute song, I felt that I should
get treated~for exhaustion.

Perhaps aware of this effect
Arlo picked up a banjo and led
us "down home” with a little
20'.« RAG. Again I noticed the
unusually tame reaction of this
normally exhuberant audience. A
few hands began to clap but they
quickly ceased as if smothered by
some mysteriousforce.

Was it an omnicient, omnipo--
tent spirit of refinement that
guards the sanctity of The Hall‘?
After all, nobody stomps their
feet for Steinberg. ‘

Undaunted, but unenthused.
Arlo went _electric and spun a
tale «of dual-consciousness in the
drug world which servedas an-
introduction to one of"his more
well-known tunes, “Comin" Into
Los Angeles”. Again I saw a Nio
of mouths moving in unison be-
hind him indicating sound ema-
nation.

\I had to content myself with
attempting to read ‘their lips.
This was difficult since I wasn‘t
quite sure that they weren't sim-_
ply yawning. I know I was. A ’ '\

Guthrie's comment at this point
perhaps aptly summed up atti-
tudes toward this concert from'
both sides of the fence, “I don’t
think _they’ve (Heinz Hall) ever
had anybody like us here before.
They don’t know how to handle
it.”. .

This observation seemed appro-
priate for the audience also, for
they were obviously uncomforta-
ble in these regal surroundings.
Another toe-tappin’ number. "Eli
The Nose Pike," evoked even less
response. '

After a soothing melodic ren-
dition of =“Come On‘ Children".
Arlo went over to the piano for
a Jimmy ‘Rodgers tune, "1000
Miles Away”. It seemed as if

The audience in‘ the theatre
seemed to be—1ike_ us—- intheir
mid-twenties, yet there were
numerous incidents of seat-bounc-
ing and small squeals during the
movie that gave testimony to our
“regression” to that glorious era

‘before we all developed sophis-

tication.

Admittedly, “Bangladesh” has a
few faults--the editing is rather
sloppy, occasionally the sound is
out of sync, and one cameraman
must have been a mite distract-
ed that night to ‘be so out of fo-
cus.

But these failings are minor.
and do not detract from the film’s
overall quality——they only make it
more real, more human-—films of
mortals doing what they do that
makes us think they’re gods.

Star Reveals Philosophy

ln” Exclusive Interview  i

by BARBARA GERAUD
"It‘s all in my music. It's there in the show." These two phras-

es are Arlo Guthrie's favorite way of answering questions to many »

of the inquiries put to him before his performance last Sunday
night at Heinz Hall. . «

But he did have some long and obviously well-thought-out ans-
wers. He doesn’t give interviews too often—in fact, he says he avoids
them——but he wasn’t as curt and uncooperative as some musicians
can be. Once caught, he stayed.

Arlo off stage doesn't really—have too much to say compared to
Arlo on -stage. When asked what he’d be doing with himself since
his last album Washington County, which came out around
Christmas of 1970), he answered “Nothing much." and seemed in-
clined to let it rest at that. ‘ ‘

Further probing revealed that_he has settled down somewhat on
a arm in Pittsfield. Massachusetts (close to James Taylor’s home on
Martha’s Vineyard . where he is engaged in the business of growing
rocks. “The land doesn’t have too much to offer except these big
builders. So I hired me a man to cultivate them.”

The twangy hillbilly accent he sometimes affects during his

monologues is just that—_an affectation used 0 help further his story- .

telling style. His normal speaking voice is rather quiet" and slightly
nasal, with a tendency to drop off halfway through a sentence.

He also ‘has the disconcerning habit of learning aslthough hang-
ing in mind-completion until whoever he’s talking to finishes it.
Then there’s the ultimate problem, he turns a question into a state-
ment and then agrees with it, which doesn‘t help much in further-
ing a conversation. '

He did talk at length on Alice’s Restaurant. Even though he

doesn’t do the song in his act anymore, he considers it a turning ~

point. “That was Newport in ’67—really got me started." He wasn’t
particularly happy with his own performance in the movie,ibut
thought that “the real actors and actresses did a fine job with what
they were doing.”

7Arlo feels the movie did what Arthur Penn (the director, who
co-authored the script),had wanted—-conveyed the picture of an al-
ternative life style.

“It wasn’t a commune . . ‘. . . I think the one mistake in the
movie was trying to portray us all living in some kind of organized
scene, when actually it was never an organized thing . . . . We
never used the word ‘commune’ . . . . We just sort of lived there
whenever we were there,” Guthrie said. '

"Each character in the movie is made up of a composite of
about 50 characters, so it seemed like somethingwas always happen-

ing with everybody. Like there was a lot going on’ with each guy -

when in reality there was only a little going on with each guy -. . .
There wasn’t that much interaction . . . . It’ was all very loose. very
free . . . . If there was any uptightness, it wasn’t long-term, "cause
nobody was therelong-term," Guthrie added. - .

Arlo said he wouldn’,t have thought of making a movie out ‘of the I

song—“It was just another song” — but that the end result was about
the best that could have been done with the idea. “If it any way

at all enlightened anybody to some of the things that are going on— .

there are alot of other people like that, living in those kind of cir-
cumstances—1f it could open the people to what kind of scene was
going down . . '. ’ '

"It would show that they’re not all freaky’. . . We were really ‘ _
sane . . . . If it had a nice effect on a lot of rednecks . . . if they _'

could get behind it . . . then that’s cool, too,” Guthrie concluded.

Off stage, Arlo comes across a great deal like he did in the
movie——reserved. quiet, shy sometimes almost to the point of with-
drawal. He neither looks nor acts his 24 years—more like 18 or 19-
and doesn‘t seem to want to be too serious about too much.

He is serious about his music, though. Othervthan the oft-repeat-
ed admonition to “listen to the show.” he was outspoken on the
value of folk music. “It never goes anywhere—it always just stays
there. The people always have it—to whistle, to sing in the john . . .
It’s never been popular music, in terms-of any kind of long-lasting
thing, like in terms of classical music, or hard rock, although there
are aspects of it in all of them.

“That’s the nice thing about it — it always lies on the bottom
and all this other stuff——all the jazz, all the classical—started off from
folk music. ‘cause that’s where it started. With the music that the
people make themselves. And in that case I’m happy to do it," Guth-

rie concluded.

Communication with his audience through the music is very
important to Arlo. His music is a very personal extension of him-
self, and he wants those out in the seats to feel it. too. .

His earlier music was the simple guitar and banjo pickin’, be-
cause “the 'places that you usually start offworkin’, don't have too
much, or if they have pianos (which I’ve always loved to play)
they’d be standups . . . you’d be facing the piano and couldn’t see
the audience . . . . And now we can play these'kinda joints . . .
with long beautiful pianos. . . . It’s a joy to play them, and my
music can reflect this.”

The purpose of his shows and his music is "to put over to peo-
ple where I am. where I’d like to be; and if they can get on to that.
,it’s great." Arlo’ said. -

He regrets not being able to spend more time on his album.
“That’s one thing . . . I’ve never really had the chance to put to-
gether an album over a long period of time . .
company wants an album. bang-bang—bang .

3

bum.‘ ’

Alice was like that—-I thought the other side of Alice was ter-
rible. The second album was a complete disaster. Then they started
getting better — ‘cause I left New York and went to California where
I had some more time. And the last three have reflected that.”

T 0 Appear at
Arts Festival

Nathan Davis. one of the top
names in jazz, will highlight this
years Three Rivers Arts Festi-
val in Pittsburgh’s Gateway Cen-
ter. The festival will be held from
May 26 to June 4 through the cour-
tesy of the Equitable Life Insur-
ance’Company of the United
States. ‘

Davis, the internationally known
saxophonist, will perform with the
Nathan Davis Sextet and the Uni-
versity’s Jazz Ensemble on Sun-
day, May 28, at 8 p.m. Director of
Jazz Studies at Pitt, Davis teach-
es a popular course in the history
and composition of jazz and di-
rects the Jazz Ensemble, which
appeared at the festival last year.

Davis is also a guest lecturer of
jazz studies at Carnegie-Mellon, '
Carlow, and at Case-Western Re-
serve in Ohio. Davis gained fame
as'a jazz saxophonist in Europe,
where jazz has long been consi-
dered serious music.

He has also performed in a series
of television concerts with the
Ray Charles Big Band.

Davis joined the Pitt faculty in
1969 as an.associate professor. .

they had been holding back all
their energy until this last song
of the set.

There was more excitement gen-
erated -in this number than all
the preceding ones combined
Seemingly expended, they took a
break.

The second set opened again
with a soft rag then progressed
slowly but smoothly through a
couple of easy going numbers
into one of his father’s songs.
It was a tale of union atrocities
and was done in a manner which
possessed a remarkable similarity
to the early Dylan as aquality.

Then coincidentally (or perhaps
not) he moved onto an old Dy-
‘Ian tune, “Don’t Think Twice.”
This time the back-up boys were
given some juice and they sound-
ed real good.

So far, not ‘a single draw1ed-
out monologue. They did a Poly-
nesian hoedown entitled Pangi
Pangi and then another Dylan
tune. _“When “the Ship Comes In“

  About
_ A   Kiss?  

 Two very attractive women. one black and one white. were
 .in— charge of handing out the awards at last Saturday’s Pitt In-

 V vitational Track Meet. A token kiss was to have been planted on
— "the winners of the first three places in each event.

The winners were placed on a raised platform so all the
fans could watch. But. what they saw might have been distress-
a ing. What the 1.000 fans were able to see. in certain instances.
’ A was, racial overtones. in an otherwise beautiful event.

_ Not once did the black woman place a kiss _on the face of-a
 , white athlete she was presenting the award to and not once did
the white woman kiss a black athlete.

. _ But,’ in both instances. kisses yvere abundant when the races
1 were the same.

I  This is not an attempt to dwell in the likes and dislikes of the
two races. If it were so hard for the women to do their job. they
:.;:~ should have done one of two things. They should haw either de-
' "clined to accept the taskjor have remained congrueaﬂ. by shak-
"-f._-’ing everybody’s hand.
 Maybe next year, as the Invitational continues to grow, lit-
Q tle things like this can be ironed out. Even to the extent where
1 everyone receives either a kiss, a smile, or a hand shake in-
 stead of a kiss to go along with their very attractive watches.

. — _ Better yet. the procedure involving "he women, can be
', dispensed with because. when you come right down to it it is a
1 sexist thing. The idea of woman kissing the man for his athletic
," fete undermines the role of the woman in modern society.

It seems that the Pitt baseball
team is not the only one to have
been stricken with a case of the
“ups and downs" during the ‘T2
season. _ , \

"We played really well. and then
we wouldgplay really poor.“ com-
mented Pitt's coach Bob Lewis.
"In the beginning it looked like
we were unbeatable and then like
at Buffalo it looked like we could-
n'twin.

"It's just been an up and down
season for us. and our major
problem has been our inconsistent
hitting." E

Cleveland State. whom the Pan-
thers face today in their last game
of the '72 campaign (2:30 p.m. at
Trees Hall Field) have also had
its share of -turbulent moments.
and like Pitt, the major difficulty
has been with hitting. '

“Our defense is good and we
have strong pitching,” related
Cleveland State’s coach Gary
Roggenburk. “But our hitting at
times has been a problem — it’s
been up and down all year.”

Roggenburk feels that unfavor-
able weather conditions have
played a key role in his teams in-
ability to hit with any amount of
consistency.

"With the bad weather we real-
ly haven’t been able to get going.“
he said. "But I think that over the
season we‘ve been improving.”

Several of Roggenburk’s mit-

,ters have been able to pull their

batting averages close to or over
the .300 mark.

First baseman Pat Washako and
catcher Roger Black are both

"Big One’?

Pitt basketball coach Buzz Ridl
has landed the "big one." Ridl
has announced’ that 6-10. 230-
pound —cent‘er. Lucius.Keese of St.
Petersburg (Fla) Junior College
has accepted a grant—in—aid and
will enroll at Pitt this fall. Keese
will be the tallest basketball play-
er ever to enroll at Pitt.

"Our emphasis‘ on recruiting
this year has been on the ‘big
Rid] noted. "In our up-
graded schedule we meet a num-
ber of teams with strong. big men.
A player like Lucius should add
immensely to our overall re-
bounding strength. Needless to
say. we’re happy to have him join
our program."

A captain and two-year starter
at St.’ Petersburg Junior College.
Keese was named to the All Divi-
sion III of the Florida Junior Col-
lege Conference. He averaged a

. little over 20 rebounds per game

during the regular season. and in
one game alone. raked off 51
missed shots.

He was selected to play in the
State’s Junior College All-Star
Game and starred with.20 points
(9-12 from the field) and 15
rebounds. Before deciding on
Pitt, Kreese also considered Jack
sonville, Wisconsin, LSU, East
Carolina, and Howard. He .will
study Education at Pitt.

While at St. Petersburg Jun-.
ior College, Keese was coached

_Pitt basketball star. George Mc; ,

and driven in 17 runs while team-
mate Black has collected three
HR's and a total of 19 RBI‘s.

Other top batsmen for Cleve-
land State are outfielders Frank
Novak. averaging .292 with 11
RBIs. and Terry Wilk at .268 with
two home runs and 15 RBI"s.

“Pat and Roger have been real-
ly outstanding, I’ve really. been
impressed with them this sea-
son,” stated Roggenburk.

"We’ve lost some close games.
some really tough games. We
haven’t been beaten badly too
many times. It‘s when Pat and
Roger are producing that we seem
to get the runswe needto win.”

 

BOBLEWIS
Eyes Finale

  

Cats End Mitt Year

Cleveland State’s strong spot.
according to its mentor, is the
performance of its pitchers.

“Our pitching has been really
good, it’s been our real strong
point,” related Roggenburg. “We
have four pretty good hurlers go-
ing for us, three left handers and
one right hander.”

Roggenburk has a comparative-
ly young club butthe youth of his
players he feels has only helped
the squad rather than hurt it. /

“Our team is primarily juniors
but in our starting lineup we have
one freshman. three sophomores.
and only two seniors playing.
We’re a pretty young team _butI
think it has made us stronger this
year. But I guess it’s a matter of
time before we can see how good
we can be."

Despite all of this youth, the .

probable starting pitcher to go

against the Panthers today is_

senior Jerry Wujcik.

Starting for Pitt is another sen-
ior, ace hurler Mike Niccols.

"This is Mikes last year and I
thought he’d like to start the
game, even if he doesn't“go all the
way," said Lewis. “If he pitches

like he did against Bucknell and’

some other games, he'll do well
against Cleveland State. ,

“Cleveland is always very good
and this year they have very good
defense and pitching,” he‘contin-
ued. “If we play like we did
against Syracuse, we’ll' win. But

if we play like we did against Buf- _

falo, we’ll lose.”

The mitters were scheduled to
play an away doubleheader
against Grove City last Tuesday.

]Vetters Finish -Finest

Season; Lose Schwartz

by RON SIEGEL
The Pitt tennis team has ended its most successfulseason ever

-with an 11-2 record. Losses to Bucknell and Kent State marred an 1

otherwise perfect schedule.

Coach. Fran Webster will be able to expect.more of the same
next season.as he is losing only one man. / ~
. The "one man Webster is losing is team captain Gary Schwartz.
who was number two seeded behind freshman Joe Kantor. Schwartz
started out the season slowly. losing his first four matches. but then he

came on strong. winning seven matches in a row before dropping-

the last two.

Kantor, one of three freshmen on the squad, ‘moved right into the.‘
number one spot and stayed there all season. His only losses were‘

CMU, ‘Hiram, ,and‘ Youngstown. In the Hiram: match, he was win-.

ning, but injured his ankle and was unable’ to finish. He missed the‘

Bucknell match due to illness.

George_.Dieffenbach, also a freshman. played number three man
all year, and he too lost only three matches. His losses were to¥Buck-

nell. Allegheny, and Kent State-

The third f'reshman, Tom Current. was fourth man and was
only defeated twice. His losses were the shutout matches of Buck-
nell and KSU. If Current won. the team won. ‘ ‘

Illness cost Pitt the services of junior Joel Hurwitz, who posted
a 2-1 mark. before being sidelined for the season with a stomach dis-

Icers In Summer Play  

by RON SIEGEL

Sixteen hockey teams. including
three from Pitt. have begun play
in a newly formed summer league
set up by Alpine Ice Chaletlwhere
all of the games are played.

There are two eight team divi-
sions. The schedule calls for "its
teams to play each team in its
own division twice. and in the
other division once. A champion-
ship playoff will follow the reg-
ular season.

Four games per night are slated.
with the first getting under way at
7 p.m. Monday through Thursday.
There is no admission charge.’

Thethree Pitt teams are com-
prised of groups from the Law
School, Med School, and the Pitt
hockey team. There is no age lim-
it for playing in the league.

The Pitt hockey team’s players
include: Mark Lieberman. Joe
Testa, Bill Glanville, Kerry
Browne, Denny Browne. Larry
Toomey, Rick Baginski, Jeff Les-
ton, Jim Richter, and Tom Dor-

~ enberg. In addition, Duke Schaef-

er is playing /for another team.

Despite some tough competition.
Pitt is considered the team to
beat. In their first three games.
they skated to 7-1, 7-4, and 5-3 vic-
tories.

The 7-1 victory was against the i

“Blues,” a team lead by former
NCAA championship hero Jeff

b Garvey.’ "Garvey scored two goals

against current Montreal Cana-
dian goalie Ken Dryden to lead St.

,_ Lawrence University to a victory

over Cornell several years ago.
He plays‘ for the Pittsburgh
Knights in the winter months.

In the other match. Knight cap.-

. tain Don Rizzo scored all four

 

goals as his team rolled over
Churchill. 7-4.

The Golden Panthers. the
branch of the Panther Foundation.
have accomplished several pro-
jects and plan others to help bols-
ter the overall Pitt athletic pro-
gram.

Membership in the club is auto-
matic with a $25 minimum contri-
bution and the ranks of Golden

Panthers have swelled to over_

1,300 members since its incep-
tion.

Goals already accomplished by

the Club are the purchase of Pitt
blazers for all athletes, the up-
grading of the training tables, and
lights for Pitt Stadium.
‘ A high priority on the club‘s list
was procuring an X-ray machine
for the Stadium. Having one will
be important to the team physi-
cians who will then be able to
treat injured athletes without the
delay of waiting for nearby hos-
pital reports. I

Along with Coach Buzz Bidl‘_s
expanding basketball schedule
and improved team. the club
hopes to upgrade the quality of the
Field House floor and renovate
some of the seating in the 20 year
old gym.

In the future, the club hopes to
remodel the old basketball court
that is located under gate one of
Pitt Stadium. This was the court
that was used prior to the building
of Fitzgerald Field House in the

For the past several seasons.
Pitt sports fans have been waiting

for a full time athletic recruiter to’

aid the coaches in their time con-
suming search for top notch
schoolboy talent. Their long
wait has finally been rewarded.
In March. just before spring foot-
ball drills. the" Panthers dipped
into their gridiron coaching staff
the personable
defensive linementor. Serafino
‘Foge’ Fazio.

A Coraopolis native. the 33
year old Faziohad quite a foot-
ball backgroun '. '

At Coraopolis High. he was
an all-district center and line-
backer, and impressed‘ the then
Cat head man Johnny'Micholo—
sen enough to win .a scholarship
to Pitt. “

He played here between 1957-
’59, where he anchored the line.
A two year starter, his senior
year saw him selected Most Val-
uable Player, All-East, and an
honorable mention All-American.
He closed out his collegiate play-
ing days by snapping the pigskin

in the North-South Game and the ~

All-America Bowl.

Selected in the fourth round of
the "pro draft, Fazio went to the
Boston Patriots. He lasted there
into the first game of the season.
when he became the last gridder
cut.

From there. he took on the job
of assistant coach at the school he
started out in. Coraopolis. After
a year there. he put in two more
at Ambridge.‘ where he was re-
sponsible for the ‘Bridgers de-
fense. _

In 1965, he returned.to.Corao-

I

seasons at his alma mater, he was
13-4-1, and won an Ohio Valley
Conference crown.

‘His high school success earned
him a chance to coach in college.

' Boston University-hired him as

head of their frosh and offensive
line, coach. —His freshman club
was 5-1. «‘

The next year. 1968. saw Fazio
move into the Ivy League. where
he became Harvards‘ defensive
line coach. Harvard was unbea-
ten. finishing with_an 8-0-1 mark.
good enough to tie for the cham-
pionship. The defense was awe-
some. rated third in the nation
against scoring and 13th in total
defense.

In 1969, Carl DePasqua, who
had been an assistant for the Pan-
thers’ during Fazio’s playing
days, became Pitt’s head coach.
One of the first men he brought to
our campus to assist him was
‘Foge’ Fazio. For the next three
gridiron seasons, he toiled as de-
fensive line coach.

Now that he's a full time re-
cruiter, he‘ll have much less time
to devote to coaching. but he’s
not entirely forsaking it.

"I‘ll stillhelp out in the spring
and fall,“ explained Fazio. "Any
thing I can do to help the pro-
gram to go.”

Fazio is just as qualified to

recruit as he was to coach. First
of all. when he was on De-

« I . Thursday, May 18,‘1972—"1‘I1ElP1T’il‘ NE'Ws—“Plagé11e‘l;

Pasquas’ coaching staff, he spent

a -reat deal of time working with '
' potential Panther prospects, and

had a considerable amount of suc-
cess getting them to Pitt.

Besides his friendly.and per— ‘
suasive manner, he also has ex-,

tensive local connections to aid»-
him in the search of‘blue chip
talent. -

The very fact that he's an alum-.. 3 5,

ni and former star performer of the
Blue and Gold was influencial
in his appointment to this post.

And if the boys he announcedfor . ’

next years football and basket-

ball squads are any indication.

he'll be recruiting here for a

long time to come.
