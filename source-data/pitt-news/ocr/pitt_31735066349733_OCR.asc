Vice Chancellor for Planning and
Budget Jack Freeman said yester-
day that Pennsylvania’s relative
standings may -be misleading
because of indirect state subsidiza-

“This is a very complex study,”
Freeman said, “and those ﬁgures
by themselves may be very
misleading. For example, the
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency (PHEAA) is one
of the most outstanding and
strongest aid programs in the

The ruling would reduce the

The ofﬁcial announcement of the
Board ruling will be received today
by the involved parties.

The exclusion of the Internation-

al Brotherhood from the upcoming
ballot is the result of a passage in
Act 195 which regulates unioniza-

Nobody yelled “Firel,” but
there was still plenty of confusion
among University and Pittsburgh
ﬁre ofﬁcials yesterday.

The questions they couldn’t
answer was: If a ﬁre alarm was
pulled in one of four campus
buildings, including the Cathedral,
would the city ﬁre department get
the message? H

University Health and Safety
Ofﬁcer Eugene Barry said yester-
day that his ofﬁce had been told
Sunday that the city was having
problems with circuit 19, an alarm
signal loop that services four
campus buildings (the Cathedral,
the Space Research Coordination
Center,’ and Alumni and Old
Engineering halls).

“The problem was discovered in
a test May 26,” Barry said. “The

Police Union Barred

may be called on to enforce
company rules. '

According to some Pittsburgh
reports, the International Brother-
hood already has prepared mater-
ials, leaﬂets and handouts in
anticipation of an upcoming ballot
position. -

A campus police labor election
will have to least 10 days to permit
public posting of the election order
from the Board.

Pitt Professional Union (PPU) and
the University administration ag-
reed to forego verbal arguments in
a PPU bid to overturn key Board
rulings that culminated in the
March faculty union elections at
Pitt. '

Board to use earlier union briefs
including the detailed notice of
exception which the union ﬁled
with the Board to stop a ﬁnal order
and initiate the hearings.

Five Thefts
Reported In

Scaife Hall

Five of thirteen thefts reported to
the campus police between May 19
and May 25 were committed in
Scaife Hall, according to a campus
crime report.

Campus Police Chief Curt
Graham said Scaife is difﬁcult to
keep secure because the public can

Presbyterian-University Hospital.

The thefts were of small portable
items, including a digital clock and
a hand calculator.

Because the medical facilities are

. building alarms were tested and

worked perfectly, but when we
called the city, they told us they
hadn’t received the call.”

After deciding the problem
rested with circuit 19, .which is
owned and maintained by the city,
Barry had signs posted near every
affected alarm box instructing
people reporting ﬁre or smoke to
call the campus police emergency
number, and not to use the alarm
boxes.

“I put these signs up because I
have a genuine feeling something’s
wrong with circuit 19,” Barry said
yesterday.

City Bureau of Communications
Foreman Dick Smith, however,
said yesterday that although there
had been some trouble with circuit
19 last week, the system was
“working last weekend’ ’ and that if
there. was any trouble with
University alarms, it did not
involve city links. I

“I pulled that alarm this
Tuesday, and they’re all working,”
"Smith said. “There was some
trouble around May 26 or May 27,
where some trouble at the School
for the Blind grounded out some
other boxes, but we found the
trouble and had it working before
the weekend.” .

“If there are signs placed by the
boxes saying they aren’t working,
they are placed there in error,” he
said. »

Barry said he believes it unlikely

. there is any problem with the
‘University system, and that if city ,

ofﬁcials have ascertained their
system is working, they haven’t

The Student Government Board
(SGB) is juggling a number of
programs this summer.

A complaint center, that will
serve as a referral service_ for
student gripes should be ready for
operation by freshman orientation,
according to SGB member Larry
Gleason.

Posters with tear-off complaint
forms posted around campus will
be accessable to students. SGB
members will receive the com-
plaints and attempt to solve the
problem directly or refer the
student to another source which
may be able to aid him, according
to Gleason.

SGB member Larry Krain, who
serves on the Provost’s committee
on faculty evaluation, said that
committee is in the process of
establishing guidelines for an
effective procedure to ‘access. the

Carnegie Report Finds

State Funding Low

(Continued from Page 1)

“Pennsylvania has taken a
different approach to the problem
of funding supporting education.
This state has some peculiar
characteristics. It relies heavily on
private institutions, converting

.them to public schools or giving

them substantial amounts of
assistance instead of building new

‘ institutions,” he said.

1 Freeman said state policy seems

to favor aiding the student instead

of the institution to enable the
student to attend the school of his
choice.

“Of course, I’d like to see more
generous funding from the state.”

Freeman added, “but I believe the

state, has been very generous in its
support.” ‘

' The state ranked highest in
higher-educational appropriations,
South Dakota, used more than
cine-third of its revenues to fund

higher education. Ten other states,
most located in the West or
Midwest, gave more than one-ﬁfth
of their revenues to colleges and
universities.

The report was optimistic con-
cerning the ﬁnancial future of
America’s colleges and univer-
sities, stating the current ﬁscal
crunch may soon pass. 1

State aid to public and private
institutions should continue to rise,
according to the report, which also
found the portion of educational
cost borne by students’ parents has
decreased by two-thirds over the
past 45 years.

Monkey Business In Labs

BY NANCY WINTNER

You may think there’s a lot of
monkey business going on in
primate research centers, but
actually it’s serious work.

At least it is for one interna-"

tionally. known endocrinologiste,
Dr. Ernst Knobil, professor and
chairman of the physiology de-
partment at the University’s School
of Medicine. Knobil and a team of
researchers are trying to under-
stand the human reproductive
system through experimentation on
._°sus monkeys. The animals’
-7“ .
héproductive systems closely res-
emble man’s, and as a result, many
of the ﬁndings can .be applied to
humans. '
According to Knobil, a better
understanding of the primates’
reproductive system will someday
lead to safer methods of birth

' control in humans.

“We must know how the system
works, so when we alter it, we
know what we are doing,” he
added.

Much of Knobil’s research is _

conducted at the University’s
Primate Research Center, the New
Texas Road Complex, located in
I?‘~:,im Borough. It has facilities

"equipped for 280 rhesus monkeys.

Given a $1.1 million grant in 1974
from the National Institute of
Child, Health and Human Devel-
opment, of the U.S. Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare,
the Complex is one of 10 federally

“The bulk of my day is devoted
to activities with lab work such as
analyzing blood samples,” he said.

But Knobil’s research is not only
conducted in the Pittsburgh area.
He collaborates with other labora-
tories located at the University of
Michigan and the National Institute
of Health in Washington. His
laboratory research there involves
studying chemicals and hormones.

- Knobil’s travels included visiting
the Russia Primate Center, India,
and Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a
member of the ‘World Health
Organization, Knobil must visit
Argentina at least once or twice a
year.

An article itself could be written
on Knobil’s numerous awards and
achievements. In San Francisco
this June, Knobil will be installed
as the president of the Endocrine
Society which is comprised of 3,000
researchers from the U.S. and a
leading number of endocrinologists
from 41 countries. Knobil is also
chairman of the Program Organiz-
ing Committee for the ' Fifth
International Society of Endocrin-
ology to be held in Hamburg,
Germany July 18-24.

Knobil is a native of Berlin,
Germany. '

Discover. . . .

The endocrinologist said his
research is an “interesting place
where lots of new_ things have been
explored.

“What we're doing is a real
turn on—it’s exciting and we have
a good time. There are great
disappointments as well, but there
are enough ‘highs’ in between to
keep us going for a lifetime. The
function of the body is immensely
complex—a tremendous challenge
for anyone interested in science.
We need more talent and we invite
inquisitive minds to join us in our
quest for understanding the human
body.

""Overall, we’ve made moderate
contributions to physiology and our
contributions aren’t spectacular in
any way.”

However, Knobil said,- it's not
particular “spectaculars” that
make a scientist successful, but the
gradual contributions.

“This is how advances are
made,” the doctor concluded.
“This step-by-step advance con-
tributes more to science in the long
run than these spectaculars that
are shown to the public. It’s a
lifetime’s career that counts for
most people.” ‘

   Scanlon’s Complaint

State Senator Eugene F. Scanlon, a voting member of Pitt’s Board of
Trustees, can’t understand “how anyone can blame the legislature”
for Pitt’s current ﬁnancial woes, according to a letter in today’s Pitt

Scanlon says that in all his years in Harrisburg, “the appropriation
_ from the Commonwealth to the University of Pittsburgh has increased
“ « at a much greater rate than tuition.’
7 A quicklook at the ﬁgures however, shows that while the state’s
, appropriation to Pitt in the 1975-76 ﬁscal year was 54% greater than
that of 1969-70, tuition rose 61% over the same period. As a member
of the Trustees’ budget-audit committee, Scanlon should know this.
 ;, ' He also should know that Chancellor Wesley Posvar and his
’  administration have made a laudable effort to provide Pitt students a

  appropriation. The seven-year increase in state appropriations, when
adjusted to‘ negate the inﬂuence of inﬂation, is only four per cent.

Advancement of Teaching says the national trend of late has been
shifting the burden of ﬁnancing higher education from the students’
parents to the taxpayers. Not so, however, in Permsylvania.
The report lists the capacities of various states to raise funds, and
also the percentage of state revenues allocated to higher education.

The state legislators have chosen not to place their colleges and
universities very high on their own rankings of priorities. This is their
decision, wrong as it may be, and they can continue to implement this
‘policy as long as their constituents will allow it. p

What they cannot do, however, is to continually allocate pitifully
small appropriations for higher education, and at the same time call
ourcriticism “unjust,” as Scanlon does.

As I read the Pitt_ budget, if the
legislature were to appropriate
nothing to the University, the
tuition for in-state students would
approximate $2,800 instead of
$1,210.

How anyone can blame the
legislature for the increases in
Pitt’s budget is beyond my
comprehension. In all of my years

Free Education Dies

BY BILL MOORE

NEW YORK [UPI]—They flock-
ed to the new nation in search of a
better life, and settled in New
York—the land of promise.

The city’s earliest immigrants
lacked formal education but be-
queathed to future generations an
opportunity for learning. The City
University of New York, establish-
ed in 1847 , as a tuition-free
institution, accepted any resident
without charge.

It was a gateway to a better life.

****a#****

Letter

 

That excerpt from a recent story
sums up the situation very well.
The City-University of New York
was more than just another urban
campus. It meant more‘ than
Boston University, or the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.‘ It was a
stepping-stone for immigrants.
The Irish, Italians, Jews,_ Polish,
Puerto Ricans; anyone who came to
New York in search of a dream had
the chance. - -

Everyone knows the story.
Puny Angelo, only son of Antonio
Ruscitto, unemployed bricklayer,
works days in a grocery store to buy
books for his night classes at
CUNY. . Time passes, Angelo
studies. Today he is Dr. Ruscitto.

  Original: Okay

I wish to take issue with the
article by Deanna Louise, may we
now review‘ some of the points
made without beneﬁt of the facts.

In regard to Original Hot Dog
attracting disruptive patrons, you

I worded that in such a manner I take

the interpretation to mean the
black patrons who make Original
their watering hole. In my past
tenure at Pitt I have seen ODI, with
much glee and success, close the

‘Student Annex because of what

they felt were “disruptive pa-
trons," which often means blacks.

Further down in your article you
attempted to debate,the_ ethics of
suspensions and appeals of the
Original. I accept the argument
that the red tape works as a booster
to the company but that’s my limit.

Leave the ethics of the LCB to
those who understand it, not to us
laypeople who won no stake in their
operation.

If certain Forbes Avenue esta-
blishments are breaking the law
why just ink the Original Hot; this
too is subject to the same
interpretation, selective persecu-
ltion! I

In seven years of patronizing
Original Hot I have yet to be there
during one of these raids. It's
rather odd I’ve been in Haddon
Hall during a raid and all they

(LCB) wanted was some ID that
would prove your age, without it
you were asked to leave: nothing
more, nothing less.

You noted that several establish-
ments hire security staff to control
the ﬂow of disruptive patrons, but
Original has three to augment their
working force, made up of Pitt
students.

Ms. Devereaux, I too share your
discontent about the violence in

{Continued on Page 5)

But it would never have been
without the free university. An
unemployed bricklayer does not
send his only son to college.

Now the school is closed, and its
270,000 students are worried.

It will reopen, they know, but
with a probable $800 yearly tuition
charge. And many of them will
have to drop out.

 can’t pay.

But, New York Mayor Abraham
Beame (CUNY ’28), says the city
budget is too tight to allow for
ﬁnancial aid.

What Beame is saying is that
the city, under hisadministration,

f’ is in such ﬁnancial shape that he

can’t afford to give its poor the
same advantages he had as a poor
minority youth.

‘ It's a shame, but both the mayor
and New York ~ Governor Hugh
Carey have said tuition is inevi-
table. The teachers at CUNY,
demanding higher pay each year,
could be called villains; or the
people who draw up the budget;
bl1t_that is not the case. The
vlllalns are the incompetent, selﬁsh

politicians who run the city and J

state not to serve their constituen-
cy, _ ‘but themselves. Sounds
familiar.

The artworks on this side are
screened and juried. Many are
given recognition awards. Usually I
don’t trust awards; they are often
tiven only to the orthodox works,
neglecting the unfamiliar, innova-
tive pieces. And so I was disturbed
that almost every painting that
excited my artistic instincts was
labeled a recognition or honorary
award winner. Either my tastes are
turning conventional, or these
works possess the excellent quality
that passes many standards. I think
the latter is the case. The works are
good, as you have or will
experience yourself. However, I
have dug up works that, though
without an ofﬁcial label on them,
deserve mention.

Eaves-dropping on my fellow
viewers, there were some works
that illicited comments reminis-
cient of the early abstract‘ expres-
sionist period when many.compar-
ed the emerging style with the
work of their kindergarden child-
ren. For example, Robert Jay
Patla’s “Creme Serene,” a pastel
work of a man and child's smeared
imates, evoked a feeling of two
autonomous humans lost to us in a
fog. And Eleanor Samples’ ‘.‘Night
Dream" of colored tissue and
smeared watercolor drippings car-
ried a pleasant, intriguing abstrac-
tion of a town’s landscape. I
resented the remarks of someone
standing behind me who compared
the work to six-year-old’s art class
project. '

Hungry Fan Reviews

Drama (and Food)

BY KEN WAMPLER

One of Pittsburgh’s most attend-
ed events is now in progress
downtown: the Three River’s Arts
Festival. It is well attended
because it is well-loved; it is’
well-loved because it is us. It is our
town’s artists, performers, musi-
cians, and last but not least us, as
admirers. ,

We arrived at the festival with a
hunger that seemed the scope of
the festival. Not being able to ﬁnd
substantial food, we nibbled for
several hours on the hot dogs_ and
candied apple foodstuffs. This diet
does not lend itself to sustaining an
afternoon’s art viewing. I'm sure it
doesn’t help theart either.

As to the art, there were -some
interesting and beautiful works,
but too many of them had
absolutely outrageous prices that
often made the work laughable.

But on to the Main Stage, where
I spent the majority of my time. I
had gone to see the Oakland School
of Theatre Dance, but I arrived in
time to also hear the Youth
Symphony.

Frankly, I was quite bored with
the music. Not only was the pace
very labrious but also the program
was overly predictable. The one
shining moment in the perfor-
mance -was Bernard Goldberg’s
double duty as conductor and
picolo player in the ﬁnal selection.

At last the Oakland School of
Theatre Dance came on stage.

They had a delayed take off and
never really made it past second
gear save a solo that made a
smooth shift into fourth. Perhaps
my disappointment was caused by
the lack of Dunham technique
shown.

Kathy Powel, instructor of the
said technique at the school, is
excellent in her own genre.
However only one dance fell into
this category. The others were, for
the most part, congo adaptations of
social dances through the past
several centuries: dances fun to
participate in out not terribly
exciting to watch. '

But there was a solo that
cleansed the cool early evening air.
And yet she retained warm rays ‘of
the afternoon's sun to light her way
on the stage. Bettv Rothbart
performed her own dance, or
should I say she enjoyed her own
dance in front of an audience. One
comment I heard » from this
audience was “she should be the
whole show.” How could I say
more.

And after all of this 1 will say it
was a glorious dav. A few
admirable sculptures, several

paintings and prints, and that
beautiful creature come to life on
stage; these are all brief moments,
but cherishedones. I feel privil-
eged to have seen them and proud
that they are happening in Pitts--
burgh.

done with a touch of charm added

Pirates Keep Winning Edge

MONTREAL (AP)—Richie _
Zisk’s sacriﬁce ﬂy scored Manny
Sanguillen with the tiebreaking run
in the eighth inning and the
Pittsburgh Pirates went on to
defeat the ;'Montreal Expos 4-2 last
night. i

Sanguillen, who earlier hit a

Sanguillen, who earlier hit a

The Pirates added an insurance
run in the ninth on Bob Robertson's
sacriﬁce fly. ,

The victory went to right-hander
Bruce Kison, 4-4, who checked the
Expos on four hits in the eight
innings he worked. He was lifted
for pinch-hitter Robertson in the
ninth and Dave Giusti came in to
pitch the ﬁnal inning.

The victory was the third for the
Pirates in their last four games
while Montreal suffered its sixth
straight loss.

The Expos, who took two of three
games from the _‘Pirates in
Pittsburgh last week, moved into a
2-0 lead in the third inning taking

Pens Name

Jim Lyttle led off the inning with
a single up the middle and was
forced at second by Pete Machanin.
Machanin wound up at second
when Pirates’ second baseman
Rennie Stennett threw the ball into
the Plttsburgh dugout trying to
complete the double play.

Mackanin advanced to third
when Fryman dumped a single
over ﬁrst baseman Willie Stargell’s
head and scored on a ﬁelder’s
choice when Jerry White sent a
dribbler down the third baseline.
Richie Hebner’s throw to the plate
was late and skipped by catcher
Sanguillen, allowing Fryman to
take third and White to go to
second. Jim Dwyer’s sacriﬁce ﬂy
scored Fryman.

But the Pirates came back in the
fourth, producing a pair of runs on
four hits to tie the_ score. Sanguillen
led off with a double to right-center
and scored on Zisk’s two-base hit to
left.

The Pirates loaded the bases
when Fryman hit Stargell and
Robinson singled, and one out later ,
Hebner singled off the bag at third
to score Zisk with the tying run.
Frank Taveras hit into a double
play to end the inning.

Baz Bastien

Ass’t. (ieneral Manager

"PITTSBURGH (AP)—Pitts-

burgh Penguin President Wren »

Blair dug deep into Pittsburgh
.-hockey history yesterday and
named Aldege “‘Baz” Bastien
assistant general manager of the
National Hockey League club.

Bastien, once the coach and
general manager of the Pittsburgh
Hornets of the American Hockey
League, led that team to the Calder
Cup in 1966-67, the last year he
coached.

When Pittsburgh entered the
NHL the following year, Bastien
became assistant general manager
of the Detroit Red Wings, the
parent organization of the Hornets.

He left Detroit for Kansas City in

~ 1973, where he was also assistant

manager.
Bastien, 55, a native of Timmins,

I Ont., was a standout goaltender for

the Hornets from 1945-49 and was
the league's top goalie for three
straight seasons. .

His career ended abruptly when
he lost an eye after he was hit by an
errant puck in training camp.

_ TRI’S BOUNCE GUNTER

_ PITTSBURGH (AP)-The
Pittsburgh Triangles, mired in last
place in the Eastern Division of
World Team Tennis, yesterday
traded Nancy Gunter to the Hawaii
Leis for Sue Stap.

Stap was a member of the
Triangles during the winter after
the Triangles had traded Raynie
Fox to Cleveland for her.

But after signing her, the
Triangles traded her to the Leis.

Now owner Frank Fuhrer says he
believes Stap can help strengthen
the women’s doubles play, which
has fallen off drastically.

Pittsburgh has lost 10 of its last
14 matches and has won only one in
the past three weeks. A

The Triangles won the WTT
championship last year, then swept
15 straight sets in three home
matches and had a 3-2 record inthe
early going of the season.

Blair, both president and general
manager of the Penguins, said the
workload was too much for one
man. ' '

“I felt that I needed somebody
with extensive experience...and
Baz was the top man for this
position,” he said. ‘

“I also feel that Baz represents
an excellent link with the tradition
rich past history of hockey in
Pittsburgh.” . .

Meanwhile, Blair announced
that defenseman Dennis Owchar
has signed a contract, leaving only
defenseman Barry Wilkins and
goaltender Bob Taylor from last
year’s roster as unsigned.

The Penguin president also said
he probably will decide next week if
Ken Schinkel will return as coach
next season.

Dark Horses Emerge,

  In Belmont Stakes

NEW YORK (AP)—“With
Elocutionist out, you’ve got to feel
good,” Johnny Campo said yester-
day, smiling in a morning rain
about Play the Red’s chances in the
Belmont Stakes. ‘

Play The Red ﬁnished a dismal
eighth in the Kentucky Derby,
causing the disappointed trainer to
mutter “the bum won’t- go to the
Preakness.”

But the Max Gluck-owned son of
Crimson Satan did go to the
Preakness and actually stuck his
head in front of leading but
faltering Bold Forbes in the stretch
before Elocutionist ﬂashed by on
the outside to win by 3% lengths.

“Well, he ﬁnally run a race,”
said Campo, his faith restored and
his hopes high that Saturday's
. 1‘/2-mile Belmont will become Play

The Red’s fourth victory and ﬁrst ' 

stakes win in a 15-race career,

Then, earlier this week, Campo’s_ 
hopes got another boost when it‘ I
was announced that Elocutionist 
would not run in the Belmont 9'
because of a wrenched ankle. The‘  .
Preakness winner and not DerbyW 
winner Bold Forbes was considered _. 
by Campo as the horse to beat in 

the Belmont.

With Elocutionist's defection," if’ 
the ﬁnal race of the Triple Crown .

was expected to draw six 3-year-
olds. '

Although the name implies it,
“American Piece” is not more of
the usual Bicentennial hogwash
that has been glaring at us all over
America these days. It is a realistic
approach to the typical American
people and their search for truth
and identity in a materialistic-
crazed world. The “Piece” of
America they try to depict,
however, is at times a bit hard to
digest. .

The play’s five characters
showed an immense amount of
versatility. The script, however,
and the ideas they were trying to
illustrate just did not work. The
vague symbolisms and quickly
changing scenes tended to confuse
the audience to the point of total
bewilderment.

Their formula is to take each
character, pin a speciﬁc personality
trait to him, and have him express
that characteristicfthrough panto-
mime. The audience chuckled as

they witnessed the fragmented
one, the worrier, the cynic, the
self-involved one and the escapist
dance about the stage, putting a
small part of each of us before our
eyes.

The characters are full of vitality
and sparkle and they fit into their
roles brilliantly. The script,
however, is cardboard, and after a
while you don't care whether they
have troubles or not.

So what happens in this setting
with this cast?

The characters intertwine and .-‘
‘become vigorously involved in the "7', \

perplexity of American society.
They use catchy scene titles such as
“the people are dispersed,” and
“the people are displaced” in an
effort to explain the confused cycle
the characters are going through.
The more confused the episodes’
become, however, the more con-
fused the audience becomes, until
no one is really sure who they are
or what’s going on.
