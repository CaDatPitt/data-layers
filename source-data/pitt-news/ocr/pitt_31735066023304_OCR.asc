The new campus bus route is
moving closer to reality, accor-
ding to members of Pitt’s Stu-
dent Government Board.

“The route should be in effect
by the spring term, but will
definitely be running by the fall.
There will be two separate
routes, one in the morning and
one in the evening,” SGB
member Martin Bertocchi said
at yesterday’s weekly meeting.

The delay in the new route is

due‘-to the fact that there is more
than one way to change the
schedule of the campus bus.

Board member Bernadette
Herward_ said, “We can either
change the route through a .
Public Utility Commission
charter, alengthy legal process
or we can apply for school bus
plates and make whatever
changes in the route we want,
whenever we want,”

Since neither of the options
has been approved yet the board

* is still pursuing botli avenues.

Former Kennedy Aide Sorensen
Disturbed By International Events

By MARY KANE
Pitt News Staff Writer.

_Presidential leadership in foreign
policy was the subject of a speech
given by’ Theodore'Sorensen Feb.
13 at Benedum Hall. Sorensen, a
former assistant and special counsel
to the late President John Kennedy,
spoke before a full house in an
event sponsored by The American
Experience, a University related
group that offers administrative
seminars on contemporary issues.

“I am deeply and rightfully
disturbed by a series of interna-
tional events that greatly test the
leadership and foreign policy of this
country,” Sorensen said.

The former Kennedy aide stated
some of these events include the
“swift and far reaching mood
change” in Washington concerning
the Russians, and the current talk
of. war and the use of nuclear
weapons. I \

Sorensen added that Washington
is now talking about “marching
down hills that were marched up

“That way we are not putting
all of our energies ‘into one
area,” said Herward. “So if
one plan falls through, we won’t
have to start from scratch on the
other.” 5

In other business, there were
several emergency funding re-
quests from the Allocations
committee. _ ‘

A $200 request for the Greek
Week Formal 'was approved
unanimously, as were requests
from the Legal Awareness Com-
mittee for $344 and the

after Vietnam. Previous foreign
‘policy decisions, such as nomore
land wars in Asia, no aid to coun-
tries bent on developing weapons,
and no compulsory military service
are now being reconsidered, accor-
ding to Sorensen.

Sorensen then explained that two
phenomena are responsible for the
foreign policy changes: The
presence of Soviet troops in
Afghanistan, and the fact that this
is an election year. '

“I am not minimizing the danger
signals...but the situation must be
viewed in an historical context, and
not with panic,” Sorensen said, in
reference to the Soviet presence in
Afghanistan. '

He added that the current Rus-
sian incursion marks the third time
Russia has installed a government -in
Afghanistan. Sorensen also. noted
that this move has alienated the
Muslim and third world nations.

Another factor in determining
foreign policy changes is the up-
coming election, according to

Academic Affairs Committee
for $355. ’ ‘

The board reported that a
meeting was held with the pro--
vost to discuss academic pro-
blems within the university.

Board member Janice Faller
said, “We felt that we really had
an open -channel to the ad-
ministration, Some of the
things we discussed included the
possibility of extended library
hours during finals and the shif-
ting of personnel to financial aid,

_ _Sorensen.
_ “Presidential compaigns are bet-

ter suited to slogans than to careful
examination of foreign, policy pro-

’ blems,” he said, adding that it is
‘easy for

candidates to make
unrealistic commitments when they
are thinking only in terms of the
November election.

Sorensen also said there is a .I

tendency in this country, during
times of crisis, tolsupport and rally
around the president without

debating or critizing him, which he,

feels is unhealthy.
“It is the duty of the patriot to

uphold the firm American tradition "

of debate and dissent,” he said.
Sorensen commented that it is

also the citizen’s duty to voice his

concerns and do something about

them. Election years, he said, pro’-, ‘ I ' 

vide an opportunityto do this. ,
However, Sorensen ‘noted that
Americans pay little attention to
foreign policy issues during ’cam-
paigns, and instead condone "and

at peak times of the year to
avoid long lines.”

Glen Walsh, secretary of the
Commuter Affairs Committee,
‘told the board about the latest 4
developments in the Port
Authority Transit (PAT) fare in-
crease hearings. The 25strip U
Tickets will still be available to
students at a discount but that
discount has been decreased 28
percent. The price of the U
ticket will rise from $9 to $12, A
according to Walsh.

Pittstudents Use Placement Service To Find Employment’

Although student population has
remained much the same in thelast
three to.lfour years, the Student J ob
Placement Service has seen a
significant rise in student usages,
going from 50 percent in 1976 to 84
percent in the last year, according
to -‘Director of Placement Dan
Nagy. '

The service, developed in the 505,
provides assistance to students
through three different depart-
ments: student employment,
graduating seniors and graduate
students, and also an alumni ser-

.*f”vice.

Julia Laird, co-coordinator -of
Student Employment, says that her

department deals mostly with ‘V

undergraduates, placing them in
part-time and summer jobs, .

Though the department is active
throughout the year, September is
ususally the heavy time for part-
time jobs, while summer employ-
ment is sought mainly from January
through April.

Laird stated that while the
greatest number of summer jobs are '
usually in the Pittsburgh area, it is
not always the case. Resorts,

camps and national parks, for in- I

stance, sometimes look for
employees in university students.

According to Laird, the Student
Employment Service receives offers
from both on-and off-campus
employers.

“Al1 payrolls and papers come

. through our office, however, -for

.o_n-campus’ jobs,” she‘ said. _ -_

The most popular jobs are, of
‘course, the one’s with the highest
salaries, Laird claims, but office
jobs also are in demand, and all

V positions pay at’ least minimum

wage.

In addition to their services, Stu--

dent Employment also gives some
attention to helping students find
summer employment in their home
towns.

For the graduating senior or the A

graduate student, the Job Place-

ment Service _provides training-

through workshops; seminars and
videotapes in how to write resumes
and carry on interviews.

The ‘video tape series is often
done by job recruiters of various
companies. ‘ -~ I

‘ “The ‘idea is that students will

listen more to the source than us,” I
said Nagy. '

Stating’ that non-technical
graduates often need more
assistance‘ in finding jobs than

_. technical graduates, Nagy offered

this piece of advice, “I think non-
technical graduates should get prac-
tical experience through indepen-
dent study, internships, and work-

study. It is the number one thing

employers are looking for.”

Sorensen said that at onetime it

' was possible for the president ‘alone

that is impossible not. The com-

Sorensen said. He then explained
what he thought was a proper
presidential role in foreign policy.
Sorensen said that the power of
the president is not derived from his
constitutional powers, but from the
opportunities his office affords
him. The president because of his
office, has the opportunity to place
foreign policy problems in perspec-

Editor Challenges
-,Nevv,spaper's Elections

By BOB WARMKESSEL
9 Pin News Staff Writer

Last night’s election of The Pitt
News editor in chief and account
executive has been contested by cur-
rent editor-in-chief Steve Guidas,
according to Larry Lunsford, Pitt
media advisor.

Karen Metzinger, supplements
editor of -The Pitt News, defeated
Guidas in the test for editor in chief‘
20-19. However, Guidas has

’;challenged the election, claiming
‘ that an ineligible voter participated

in the balloting.

Richard A. Franzi was re-elected
as account executive. He ran unop-
posed and received 37 votes.

Lunsford, who presided over the
election in accordance with The Pitt
News constitution, ‘said a voter in a
Pitt News election must receive pay
from the newspaper in at least two
of the three pay periods preceding
the election, according to the con-
stitution.

“I will check the payroll records
to ascertain the validity of Guidas’s
charge and make a decision regar-
ding the contesting sometime
Wednesday (today),” Lunsford
said last night.

If Guidas’s charge is confirmed,

Guidas said the paper “has im-
proved tremendously” during his
year as editor in chief. He added
he has learned that “ an editor__i_s
just an editor. He’s also a
businessman, a club president, and
advisor, spokesman and
diplomat.” This knowledge would
help him in a second term as editor-
in-chief, he said.

Metzinger stressed the need for
the newspaper to recruit more staff
members. Increased communica-
tion between the editorial, business
and production staffs of the paper
would also be one of her goals, she
said. A

The need for acting upon sugges-
tions made at staff meetings should
be made a priority, Metzinger add-
ed.

I      Student Victoﬁes

Last week’s surprise announcement by Pitt’s ad-_

ministration concerning revisions of the proposed
residence hall visitation policy _was a major victory
for the student body.

The original proposal stipulated that students
could‘ not host overnight guests of the opposite sex at
any time. Pressure by Pitt residence hall students
forced the administration to revise the proposal,
allowing for overnight guests of the opposite sex on
weekends. "

The compromise proposal was a ‘victory for
students in a number of ways. . _

First, the policy itself offers something for
everyone. It accomplishes the need for tighter securi-
ty in Pitt’s residence halls by restricting the flow of
visitors. A

One of the reasons for the changes by the ad-
ministration, guaranteeing privacy for residents, has
also been achieved. At the same time, there" is still
room for overnight visitors of the opposite sex, thus
satisfying (to some extent) the demands of the resi-
dent hall students.

Although the new visitation is still a bit archaic-
since it does restrict students who may wish to have
visitors of the Opposite sex during the week, the new
policy must go through a testing period. At the end
of the spring term, the board of trustee's student af-
fairs committee will review the policy, examining its
value and consequences to the students.

Another accomplishment by residence hall student
leaders is that they actually impressed at least one
trustee for their concern over the new policy. Judge
Ruggero Aldisert, a long-time supporter of student

Page 4—Wednesday, February 20, 1980

rights, said the students “asked very intelligent ques-
tions, were very sensitive, and had strong feelings
(about the policy)” and that “their points were very
ably presented.”

The biggest victory of all was the residents deter-
mination, dedication and organization in trying to

overturn the administration’s original visitation
, policy proposal. Although opposition to the policy

v-:-
. \__

was originally splintered without a spokesman for the ~

residents, student leaders quickly organized

A themselves into a solid voice of opposition.

Evidence of their solidarity could be seen through‘

the -tremendous publicity the residents generated in
their fight plus the formulation of specific reasons
for opposing the new policy.

We congratulate the resident hall student leader-
ship for its actions concerning the new visitation
policy and hope that those leaders continue to strug-

gle for their constituents’ rights. Groups like the Stu- ’

dent Government Board, the School of General
Studies Student Cabinet Council, and the Graduate
Professional Student Organization should learn from
the work of the residenthall students, that they too
could fight the administration successfully.

Student Cabinet Council Warned OfFinonciol Problems

We are writing in reference to ‘an
_article which appeared in The Pitt
News on Wednesday, February 13.

‘ The article, entitled “Financial Dif-

ficulty Closes Night Times,” told of
the financial problems which caus-
ed the demise of the Night Times.
In "the article, SGS Student
Cabinet Council president David
Huffner claimed that the reason
there were not sufficient funds to

‘continue publishing the Night

Times was that there was “inade-
quate fiscal management” on the
part of the Night Times staff.

As former staff members, we are
aware that William Means, former
editor in chief, did warn council

repeatedly of financial difficulties,

although council denies that such
warnings were made. Mr. Huffner,

in particular, chose to ignore the
warnings.

Since the Night Times is Officially
“a publication of the SGS Student
Cabinet Council,” the council
should have considered the Night
Times as a real part of its budget
and should have studied carefully
what the allocation should have
been for the publication. Perhaps
Mr. -Huffner should take a look in
the mirror from now on whenever
he speaks of “poor management.”

The Night Times review commit-
tee is another farce which the Coun-
cil is passing off _as aiegitimate ad
hoc committee. The committee is
supposed to make a recommenda-
tion to the council about the future
of the Night Times. This seems a bit
absurd since three out of five coucil

reached, should be included.

Letter Policy

The Pitt News welcomes letters fromreaders.
tended for publication should be typewritten, double-spaced,
and should indicate the writer's University affiliation, if any.

Letters to the editor must be signed by the writer. Unsigned
letters cannot be published under any circumstances.
However, a writer's name can be withheld from publication
at request. A telephone number, at which the writer can be

The Pitt,I_\lew.s ,reserves the right to edit all letters. ‘

Letters in-

members make up part of the ‘com-
mittee. Night Times staff members
were never informed that they also
could have been ‘members .of the
committee. Also, according to Mr.
Huffner, the council is not bound
by any recommendation the com-
mittee presents to it. Why doesn’t
the Student Cabinet Council just
make the decision itself instead of
creating a pseudo-committee?

The Night'Times was a legitimate
publiciation designed to inform
evening school students of the latest
news events of interest to them. Mr.
Huffner claims that he is only in-
terested in serving SGS students the
best way that he can and that is the
reason why he and the council pro-
posed the review committee. In-
stead, it seems that Mr. Huffner
and the council are only interested

. in their own well-being, rather than

that of the evening school students.

It seems that the long hours that
the editorial staff put into the Night
Times did not serve the council or
Mr. Huffner enough to produce a
propaganda sheet to espouse the
virtues of the council.

The ‘Draft-

An Alternative

The United States of America
currently possesses" an arsenal
capable of destroying ‘the world
something like 30 times over. So
why do we need a draft? This is a
question that many people have
been asking themselves lately.
People who are tired of war and the
threat of war.

We live in a hostile and very real
world, one that demands that we
acknowledge its realities and -face
up to them. In our international
political system there are no law
makers. There is no one to enforce
the rules. A nation can do virtually
anything it wants until checked by
another nation, or group of na-
tions. So long as this system stands,
the threat’ of war will always be
there.

Economic sanctions, boycotts,
and the use of the United Nations as
an international court are some of
the ways we have tried to deal with

aggression and expansionism. They

are approaches that have been used
to deal with the recent crises in Iran
To declarewar
on Iran would not have been an ap-
propriate means of - resolving .‘ the
situation. My point is that these ap-
proaches will not deter such activity
in the future_.- Iran hadnothing to

lose by taking Americans hostage,
nothing, that is, long as it remained

it

. confident that the U.S. would no‘,

launch an invastion. The only real '

deterrent to such behavior is to
possess the ability to use force and
demonstrate a willingness to use it.

The horrors of war could easily
become a nightmare forced upon us
out of a lack of preparation. In re-
cent years we have relied more and
more on our atomic arsenal as a
deterrent to ‘aggression, and,
ultimately, to a major war. Our
bombs have become our crutch,
even though no sane man would use
those bombs knowing the conse-

quences. Still the bombs get bigger

and our military force ‘gets weaker. Q}

The volunteer army is a failure. If
the Soviets were to launch an attack
on the Persian Gulf tomorrow there
is very little that we could do about
it. '

We have based our foreign policy
for so long on the fact that we have
a_ superior nuclear arsenal that it has
become the only way that we could
stop the Russians in a direct con-
frontation. 'Accidents seldom hap-
pen when we are prepared for them;
neither do wars. We need the draft
and a strong military, if for no
other reason than as an alternative
to nuclear war. People are the true

strength of a great nation. Wheregt

are the people now?

 Two. Month Ordeal Almost Completely Frustrates -Student

:9?‘-
.

 

»o’.‘

I am enrolled in the SGS here at
Pitt. For the past two months, I
have been almost completely
frustrated by the bureaucratic red
tape in the school. My problem and
my attempts to resolve it are as
follows: ,

I took a Public Administration
undergraduate course (Introduction
of P.A. 801) in the fall term. On the
fourteenth week of class, the Pro-
fessor (Jerome McKinney) inform-
ed the class that we owed him $3.75
for class handouts (139 pages of
xeroxed materials from g journals,
etc.) a

Not being certain that such a‘

charge was legitimate, I checked in
the SGS office the following day
and was informed that the pro-
fessor was not allowed to set such a
charge.

At the last class, the professor in-
formed the class that we would be
able to receive our grades over the
phone, but those who did not pay
the $3.75 would not have a grade
recorded. Again I checked with
SGS and was informed that the pro-
fessor had no right to withhold a
grade for nonpayment of the
charge.

Over the holiday recess 1 received
my grade - a G gradegl phoned Pro-
fessor McKinney and questioned
the reason for the grade and was in-
formed that since he did not have a
check from me I would not get a
grade. I informed. him that I had
checked this matter out with SGS
and was well within my right to
refuse to pay the amount since it
was not a legitimate one.

Throughout this time, ‘I was be-
ing assured by Dean Comfort and
Pat Beck of the Student-- Cabinet
that the charge was indeed il-
legitimate, that Professor McKin-
ney was not authorized to withhold
my grade and that the matter would
be cleared up. I might add that
throughout this entire time the one
person who seemed to be; as upset

—about the entire situation as I_was

was the student ombudsman,
Larry Mann. After countless phone
calls and trips to the SGS Office,_I
was informed, after I assured Dean

.Comfort that I was informed that I

was well within my right to file
academic integritycharges, and that
I intended to do so, that Dean
Comfort and Dean Haley had con-
ferred by phone and had made ar-
rangements for the grade to be

5 changed. This decision was sup-

-posedly made on January 25. On
February I I received the attached
letter from Dean Haley. On ques-
tioning the meaning of the letter, I
was informed by Dean Comfort
that he was aware that the letter was
to be sent, this was part of the
agreement made with Professor

McKinney in exchange for the grade ,

change. After a visit to the
Judiciary Office, I was informed by,
Dean Comfort that the grade
change had indeed been made and I
would be informed of it as-soon as
the SGS office received notifica-
tion. This took place on February 4.
As of today, February 12, the SGS
Office has no record of receipt of a‘
change of grade in my name.

I neglected to mention that when
I received the G grade and-on one of
my many calls to the office of Dean
Comfort, I was informed that Pro-
fessor McKinney informed "the

” Dean that there were a total of five

grades withheld for the reason of‘
non payment for the materials. I
was also informed that the only
department of the University that
can withhold a grade-for ﬁnancial
reasons is the ‘Registrar's Office.
Throughout the entire time, I was

~assured that the charge was not a
, legitimate one and that indeed Pro-

fessor McKinney was wrong, that

, even though 'the'jcharges made ‘for
- xeroxed material is standard pro-_.‘

   

i‘.

  

cedure in GSPIA it is not a standard
procedure of the University nor of
SGS.

This matter, trivial as it might
seem has been going on for a
period of almost two months and
my grade still remains unchanged.
(So, for all I know have the other
four grades.) Dean Comfort in-
formed me that the other grade
changes couldn’t be made because I

_ appealled the matter, since I was the

only person who had registered the
complaint. This to me appears to

‘_ be very unfair as also the accep-
tance of the $3.75 from the other
students in the class who paid‘ the
fee, since everyone admits that the

‘charge was indeed not legitimate
and that the professor was wrong in
withholding grades for such a
reason. V

’ Perhaps I would not have
challenged the grade had I not”
worked within the. University and
been able to make the phone calls
and the offices visits which ap-
peared necessary to try to correct
this situation. Again, it seems very
unfair to punish the SGS studens
who haven’t the time or the oppor-
tunity to go from office to office to
correct a situation which should
not have existed in the first place.
Perhaps I would not have been
quite as persistent had I not been in-
formed by everyone, the om-
budsman, the student cabinet,
Dean Comfort, the judiciary ofﬁce,
etc, that the charge was indeed not
correct and the G grade was not
legitimately given. A situation such
as ‘this, casn certainly makelone

I started at Pitt in 1973, and work

I read the

issue, I was surprised at the ‘lack of

cheaper from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.
MCI Telecommunications was
the first company to challenge Bell

the FCC ruled that just as they can’t

Bill McGowan, Chief Executive
officer of_ MCI, said, “I think our

‘that when we started we looked at

the "industry afresh, and we asked
ourselves how to operate this

America's Honor At Stoke,—lS There Something To Hide?

I was reading in Monday’s edi-
tion of the Pittsburgh Press an arti-
cle by Lou Ham's that contained a

- phrase about Washington’s concern

about “obtaining the release of the
hostages under honorable condi-
tions.” That line triggered an
alarm. Why is America’s honor at
stake? Do we have something to
hide? Is there something rotten in
the states of our international af-
fairs? I began to feel uneasy.
President Carter has repeatedly
rejected any proposals made by Ira-_
nian president Bani-Sadr that in-
clude the sanction that the U.S.
“admit to its ‘crimes’ in Iran during
the rule of the Shah.” (New York
Times 2-15-80). Did the U.S. com-
mit any ‘crimes’ under the Shah? If
we did then they must have been
very bad if our government is afraid
of having them exposed. If we did
not commit any crimes under the
Shah, then why has our government
been so hesitant to agree to a probe

of the Shah’s regime, conducted by

.,...

a tribunal comprised of diplomats
mutally agreed "on by the U.S. and
Iran? It appears that the U.S.
government is stalling. For what?
Aren’t there still 50 Americans be-
ing held hostage in Tehran? Isn't
the biggest issue getting those
Americans safely back, or is the
bigger issue how to get the hostages
back without "any detrimental
government ‘exposure?

Also in Monday’s Press, the Rev.
Scott, a Pittsburgherand member
of the Pennsylvania Human Rela-
tions Commission, gave an account
of her Valentine’s Day tour of
Tehran. She spoke, with imprisoned
members of the Shah’s secret police
and visited various points of in-
terest concerning the Iranian
revolution.

One place she and 49 other
American’s visited was the
Cemetery of Martyrs, where 6,000
Iranian protestors were gunned
down at the hands of the Shah dur-
ing a single demonstration. Did the

U.S. support a ruler whose regime
employed practices so contrary to
the‘ fundamentals of American
ideology and basic human rights?

_The right of the people to assemble

is at the very heart and soul of our
American civil rights. Did our
government keep a man who
slaughtered 6,000 souls at a single

demonstration, in power for 25 V

years? -

The» Rev. Scott also gave ac-
counts of stories told to her by Ira-
nian citizens concerning the brutali-
ty of the Shah’s regime upon
political dissidents. Rev. Scott
reported that “Men in prison had
their children brought before them
and dismembered.” How, in the
name of God, could a nation,
founded on the ideals of Christiani-
ty, have supported, let alone pro-
tected a man who is responsible for
this kind of satanic butchery? I
weep at even the thought of, my
country being the slightest bit a part
of this heinous thing.

The Shah must have been very
‘crucial to U.S. interest’s for our
government to have supported him
for so long. This upcoming probe
-of the Shah’s regime must be very
‘threatening to our international
image’ for our government to have
protected him for so long.

Are these alleged ‘vital interests’
so essential to our nation that it is
worth supporting a regime that tor-
tures political dissidents and
dismembers children? Do the ma-
jority of Americans feel that these
interests are worth this kind of
atrocity.

Are those so called ‘vital in-
terests’ ‘aimed at benefiting the ma-
jority of Americans or are they aim-
ed at gaining huge profits for the
“unseen few” at the expense of the
lives of thousands of innocent peo-
ple?

It is time for the White House to
come out and define our vital US.

interests and also define why they»

are so vital to the well being of the

nation. (If we are going to be asked
to defend them we had better know
just exactly what they are.)

Did the government “of the peo-

ple, for the people, and by the peo-
ple” have anything to do with the
alleged crimes of the Shah? This
question makes me feel very uneasy
about Carter’s reluctance to
negotiate. Is there something rotten
going on? What are ‘vital U.S. in-
terests’ all about? How are we go-
ing about protecting and preserving
those interests? I don’t know, and it
scares me.

If we, as a self governed nation,
are innocent of having anything to
do with the alleged ‘crimes’ of the
Shah, then our leaders should not
be afraid to defend that innocence
before a mutually accepted panel of
diplomats. If we are involved...the
electorate has a right to know why,
how and who is responsible before
election time. Meanwhile,
bring back the hostages, and thank
God that those militants holding the
embassy have not used the methods

used by the Shah on his prisoners.

Open Letter
To Kimbo

This is an open letter to Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs,
Conney Kimbo. I would like to
speak to Dr. Kimbo as an individual
who teaches students at Pitt. Dr.
Kimbo claims to be acting as a
responsible administrator. He
claims to‘ be acting in the best in-
terests of the students. What I
would like to ask Dr. Kimbois, how

- can I teach my students, even look

them in the face, after he and the
rest_ of the administration have
violated their rights? '
How can we teach students "the
basic tenets of democracy, when he
responds to the question of whether

or not students may vote on the new _

dorm policy by saying that it
“would not be acceptable to the ad-
ministration ‘or the Board of
Trustees.” If these people violate
the rights of the student, then how
can we expect the students to
respect the rights of others? '
Dr. Kimbo may wonder what
rights were violated. I would seek _to
remind him that under the Four-
teenth Ammendment the state may
not “deprive any person of life,
liberty, or property without due
process of, law.” Clearly with
regards to the new dorm policy Dr.

Kimbo and others violated this 
basic right, by denying students due

process. Also, the action may
violate the clause in this ammend—
ment with regards to equal protec-
tion under the law, as it excludes
certain parties from the residence
halls during a certain period of
time. "i

Finally the actions of this
“responsible” administration
would seem to violate the state Sun-
shine-law, in that it was enacted
without benefit of prior notice,
which the state law mandates.

' If Dr. Kimbo is being responsi-
ble, then how could he, and others
take this action against franchised
citizens, the student body? If he can
tell me how I may face my students

‘after this most irresponsible of ac-

tions, then I would hope that he
would reply to me here, in The,Pitt
News.

Pitt Faces ’Cats

By AMIN GHOSSEIN
Pitt News Staff Writer V

Tim Grgurich must be pulling out
his hair trying to figure out what’s
wrong with his team. First the ex-
cuse was fatigue, and that well
could be justifiable because the
Panthers did go through a very
rough January. Grgurich
countered this by giving his club a .
few days off after the Duquesne
loss at the arena. So what happens? ,_
Pitt plays two horrendous against
Penn State and W.V.U. and the
coach’s worries continue this
Wednesday against Eastern ‘Eight
leader Villanova.

To say that this is a critical game
would be the understatement of the
year. After all, the Panthersstill
haven't ‘clinched that last home
court advantage and they better
start playing with a little more in-
tensity if they are to do so.’

Villanova comes into the game

‘with a 7-2 league record and some

game was lost on some shoddy pass-
ing late in the game.

The Panthers can only hope that

with the return .of point guard
Dwayne Wallace, who played a very

credible game against WVU the

ballhandling problems will end.

Against Villanova, the Panthers
must keep on playing the tough
defense but the shot selection must
be more choosy. Being in -a
shooting slump, the Panthers must
create some good shots to bring
their confidence back. Pitt should
also try to feed the ball more to Sam
Clancy, who really must start
shooting more.
that the Panther’s need a total
upheaval but they just have to do
the things they did a month ago
against Duke and Iona, and all that
entails is a little more intensity. A

The Villanova game is an import-

ant test, for a win will start the '

momentum needed to go into the
tournament and restore some con-
fidence into the players.

Villanova ,

led by Kathie Beisel. The rally fell
far short, and the Pantherettes had
their 20th victory in the bag.

The Pantherettes were led by

' Miklasevich with 26 points. Lewis

chipped in 22 and Welsh con-
tributed 14. Kathie Beisel led
‘Villanova scorers with 11 points.
Miklasevich and Welsh commanded
the boards, pullingdown 12 and 11
respectively, as the Pantherettes
also outrebounded the Wildcats,
49-39.

Panic Bamon Yet

-Penn State left the EAA in order to “establish
itself” among the nation’s best in basketball. While
it’s certain no one would bet on the Nittany Lions
against DePaul or Syracuse, PSU is having its best
season in many years. When coach Dick Harter ar-
A rived in State College with. his slow-down tactics,

many opponents and fans alike yawned.

State’s 1978-1979 record of 12-18, however, was

the most wins for the team in the past five years and

this season the Nittany Lions have won 17 games.

 Pitt Tournament True To Plan

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer .

The Pitt Invitational volleyball
tournament went pretty much as
planned last weekend with Rutgers
Newark taking tournament, honors.
Rutgers, seeded number one prior
to the tournament’s opening round
was followed by Ohio State,‘ Penn
State and Ball State.

The Panthers" fared well,

although the s"coreboardididn’t tell

exactly the same story. Pitt was
placed in Pool B with Ohio State
(the Panthers first round opposi-
tion), Queens (a team from
Canada) and Edinboro. The top
three teams from each pool advanc-
ed" into the events playoffs ‘on Satur-
day. ' ,

The tournament, which Panther
coach Ray Reilly believes will be a
premier Eastern tournament in
years to come, brought in some ex-
tremely tough competition for the
Panthers. ‘

First foe Ohio State proved to be i
too much for Pitt to handle as the

Buckeyes handed'Pitt two straight
defeats, 15-12 and 15-5, in the best
of three matches. The Panthers did
get off an excellent start against the
taller and more experienced
Buckeyes.

The Panther momentum, before
a vocal home crowded carried over
into the next match against Queens,
a highly ranked Canadien College.
But again it was to no avail as Pitt
fell to their second defeat of the
night by 15-12, 12-15, 14-16 scores.
As the scores show the competition
was close and exciting.‘ The match
was a very long drawn out battle
between the two schools.

The match point was scored when
the ball surprised, Pitt newcomer
Jerry Stephens from behind and
touched him within the boundaries
putting Queens up 16-14. Despite
these first two losses Reilly thought
that his squad put in a much better
performance than the Ohio State
tournament of a week ago,

“Our performance in this tourna-
ment was l00 percent improved

A

than the show that we put in at
Ohio State,” said Reilly. “We
played as well as we did at the Nit-
tany Lion Invitational, where we
tied ‘for third place. I think that set-
ter Dave Baird put in his best games
of the season in this tournament.”

Besides Baird the entire Panther
squad all put in some hard-nosed
performances. Returning veterans
of the Panthers initial season Ricky
Camacho and Brian DeVine along
with captain Jeff Beavers and Don
Hardin played well through-out the
two day event. .

The Panthers faced their easiest
competition of the weekend against
Edinboro. Pitt won the match 15-3

and 15-10. The win advanced Pitt‘ ’

into the playoffs where they met
George Williams of Chicago.
this, the Panthers final match of the
invitational, ended in a heartbreak-
ing 15-13, 15-13 defeat.

The weekend that lied ahead for
Pitt is the most important on the
young team’s schedule.

Brenda Chorpenning-‘Betterlate Than Never’      

By STEVE THOMAS
Pitt News Staff Writer

Brenda Chorpenning of the
women’s track team is one athlete
who is familiar with the famous say-
ing, “better late than never.” The
reason for this is because she didn’t
begin her career until her junior
year at Triadelphia High School in
Wheeling, West Virginia.

“My brother was very much in-
volved in swimming and track,” she

I said, “and was responsible for get-
‘ting me started.” '

r"/"

_,:«- \K_»,vv

Chorpenning first participated in
the 100-meter dash and near the end

of her junior year began running‘

other events.

“My coach asked me to run the
half-mile, the mile, and with the
mile relay team,” she said. “It
turned out pretty good for me
because I was state champ in the
half-mile and mile events, and our
relay team finished fifth. I was real-
ly shocked and surprised with my
results because I was also ‘very ac-

tive in basketball and volleyball at
the same time.”

From that point on, things could
only get better for Chorpenning. In
her senior year, she placed first in
the half-mile at the state champion-
ships and decided to continue her
career by attending Pitt.

. “I liked the idea of going to Pitt,
Chorpenning said. “It was only an
hour and fifteen minutes away and
they treated me really well when I
visited here. I was also impressed
with the program which was well-
organized and I had a feeling that it
would be going places.”

Chorpenning also learned a
valuable lesson in her freshman year
at Pitt. She learned how to lose.

“Although my times improved, I
realized that I wasn’t pushed
enough in high school which was a
sin,” she said, “and eventually got
beat and learned how to be
second.”

Chorpenning’s times improved
eight seconds since her senior year

perfectly.

in high school but at the same time
experienced a serious injury for the
first time in her career. She frac-

tured her foot which cut the season A

short but bounced back v her
sophomore year. -

“My sophomore year was my
best,” she said. “My times were
career highs and I enjoyed it the
most of all my years here.”

Chorpenning is an elementary
education major and will journey to
Birmingham, England soon to
teach intermediate‘ grade school
children. She currently teaches
youngsters in Wilkinsburg.

Glancing back-at her overall ex-
perience at Pitt, Chorpenning is
grateful and convinced she made
the right choice.

“I’m very glad I came here,” she
said. ‘ “I never thought I would
cometo a city school. I’ve met a lot
of good people and if I had to do it
again, I’d come here.”

Chorpenning has quite a collec-
tion of impressive statistics here at

Pitt. She owns school records in the
mile, 1500-meter run, three-mile
run, 880-meter run, and is part of
the record relay teams in the mile
and two-mile.

Referring to the Olympics, she
said, “I’m not at that caliber now
to attempt to be successful. ‘ I would
be much more serious if they had a
marathon event. Right now
though, I’m really excited about
teaching.” _

The head coach of any team is
usually understanding and helps
guide the athlete to success, and in
Chorpenning’s case, this is true of
Alfreeda Goff.

“She has helped me to develop a
good and healthy attitude about
winning. She has always been sup-
portive of me and has helped me
grow as a person and at the same
time, deal with people,” she said.
“I can go to her‘ about anything,

not just track. She believes that you
are a student first, athlete second, -
and is just a very, concerned in-

 

dividual.”
Of all the great memories that
Chorpenning will

savor after, _
graduation there is one that is most.
A important to her. - '

'21

“I’ve belonged and been involved  A 5

with the Fellowship of Christian:

Athletes, (FCA) all four years" at

Pitt. It has been an important part ’
of my life,” she said.‘ “‘We'have’
had enthusiastic and excellent
leadership and have learned the .

relevance and importance of being a
Christian. The FCA has added

even more to the joy of attending.

Pitt. I would give God--credit for
everything I’ve done. ‘Whatever I

do and wherever I go, I know who

I’m doing it for.”

Chorpenning plans to work at a '

sporting goods store in Florida after
graduation in April,
lifetime goal is to teach in a depriv-
ed, inner-city elementary school

where she can help those that are

less fortunate.
