Game Tomorrow
To Determine
Pitt Defense

Scene of many sport champion-

men. Our opinions do not re-
ﬂect the background of study,
are based solely upon the im-
pression created in us by the
subject. And with that, we be-

11.

Cubist Braque, schooled by Ce-
zanne in the same school with
Matisse, is called “radical.” His
concept, as well as we can under-
stand, declares that art should be
the recording not of things as they
seem to the eye, but of things as
they really are.

“The Yellow Cloth,” then, is
Braque’s representation of the
emotion created by a table with
a yellow cloth, the emotion which
tells his mind that “this is how
the table looks to me, although
most people will see it otherwise.”

What process in defense of the
new picturization must develop in
the mind of the artist we shall
never know, because we cannot
receive the same emotional stim-
ulus from his creation. That a re-
formation of an orginal still-life
must undergo an expression
through cubes and cylinders, we
do not understand.

We in our naivete still prefer
the old, old conformist methods
of reproduction. We, who may or
may not be dull and prejudiced,
firmly believe that we have never
seen anything similar to "The
Yellow Clot ” with our eyes. That
which we see on Braque’s canvas
is truth and what we think we
have seen all the time is false is
hard to believe.

It has been, and, until we are
refuted," will still be our opinion
that as it appears to mankind,
sans cubists, is best reproduced. by
verisimilitude, with permission
being granted the painter to se-
lect the subjects that best express
his (ideal. Personally, we favor
clear-cut photographic art—-be-
cause we understand it and be-
cause we have experienced it.

If cubism is to be the accepted
means of portrayal, we shall re-
tire, with our photograph album,
to the attic.

Distelhorst Returns

From Convention

Carl F. Distelhorst. instructor in
accounting, has returned from the
annual convention of the United
States Building and Loan league,
which was held this year at Lps
Angeles.

Mr. Distelhorst was reappointed
to the national accounting com-
mittee. He participated-, as the
representative of Pennsylvania, in
a speaking contest in which _he
competed with representatives
from every, state in the Union.
His topic was “Can Supervision

lships, the Polo Grounds in New

York City will be the setting to-
morrow afternoon for the annual
game between Pittsburgh and
Fordham, a clash that is calcu-
lated to determine the gridiron su-
premacy of the East.

Holders of the Lambert trophy
and the Rose Bowl title, the
Panthers are in the defending po-
sition.
the East last year, stands as the
logical challenger. For, with a
more able outﬁt this season, it is
prepared to climb into ﬁrst place.

Whatever gods there are that
hover over the Polo Grounds, they
have been sour to the Panthers.
Pitt has been unable to win a foot-
ball contest in Manhattan.

For the past two years, Pitt has
played the Rams and each time
the result was a scoreless tie. In
both these matches the Panthers
were the superior team and both
times they had the correct mental
attitude. Perhaps it has been
their over-zealousness in attempt-
ing to please the New York crit-
ics, most potent in the country,
that has reacted against them.

Tomorrow the situation is some-
what different. On the basis of
play this year, Pitt is not the best
team. If any superiority can be
given, it belong to Jimmy Crow-
ley’s charges who have shovsn a
smooth precision in walloping
their two opponents, Franklin and
Marshall, 66-0, and Waynesburg,
43-0.

Fordham’s teams have been dis-
tinguished in the past or the
stout-heartedness of their de-
fense. This distinction remains,
but it has been given a more

northern Spain, Father Ferger
acted as correspondent of the Na-
tional Catholic welfare conference
news service, which supplies news
to Catholic newspapers
United States and several foreign
countries.

OPEN FORUM

ings between an address by the
speaker and an open question ses-
sion.

Also scheduled to speak at Pitts-
burgh Community Forum Monday
evening at 8:15 o’clock in the
Schenley high school auditorium.
Father Ferger will defend the Na-
tionalist side of the Spanish war

Win Ma ority
. Of Awards

“The Yellow Cloth,” an a.b- ’

stractionist painting by the
foremost Cubist, G e o r g e s
Braque, was awarded first prize
at the Carnegie International
Art Exhibition which opened to-
day. .
Seven out of the eight awards
went to European artists. Felice
Casorati, Italy, won second prize
with his Woman near a Table.”
Third prize went to Josef Pieper
of Germany for “Family Portrait.”
NEW YORKER WINS

Robert Philipp of New York
City, who was awarded ﬁrst hon-
orable mention, was the only
American to win a prize. “Karis-
brucke, Prague,” by Oskar Koko-
schka; “Carnival,” by Emilio
Grau-Sala; and Marcel Gromaire’s
“The Night Watchman,” received
the remaining honorable mention
awards.

Vaclav Spala, Czechoslavakia
artist, was awarded the Alle-
gheny County Garden Club Prize
of $300 for his painting, “Still
Life With Flowers.”

The jury which made the
awards was composed of four
artists: Henry Varnum Poor and
Judson Smith of New York; Raoul
Dufy of Paris; and Ferruccio Fer-
razzi of Rome. Homer Saint-
Gaudens, director of ﬁne arts at
the Institute, was chairman of the
jury which met in Pittsburgh on
September 22 and 23.

ASSOCIATED WITH MATISSE
Georges Braque, the winner of
the $1,000 award, was born at Ar-
genteuil in 1881. His ﬁrst work
was inﬂuencedby Signac, Van
Gogh, and most of all by Cezanne.
For a time, he was associated with
the group known as “les fauves,”
which included Matisse, Derain,
Vlaminck, Rouault, and Friesz.

In a measure, as a reaction to
this “fauviste” movement, came
Cubism, an invention of Pablo
Picasso and Braque. This is con-
ceded to be the most original de-
velopment of twentieth century
painting.

CUBIST EXPERIMENTER

Even before Picasso, Braque
was experimenting with the cube
and deciding that “we must not
imitate when we wish to create.
The appearance of things is not
to be imitated, for the appear-
tance of things is merely the result
of them.”

In response to a suggestion by
Cezanne that “all nature can be
reduced to the cube, the cone and
cylinder,” Braque and Picasso
painted brilliant geometrical forms
dubbed “Cubism” by Matisse.

Picasso, meanwhile, has gone
on to a neo-classic ‘form, while
Braque, who developed and re-
ﬁnedlhis style, has perfected and
deﬁned Cubism. One does not
think of Cubism as a form of tra-
dition, but Braque feels that it is
closely allied with the classic
spirit of French art.

which controls and corrects emo-
tions. Nobility arises from the
reticence of emotion,” wrote the

School As Usual . . .

The Pitt football team plays an important

" game in New York tomorrow.
‘And the team will play several others, possi-
bly of more importance than the Fordham

game.

Last week the team played and won one
‘of its harder tests.

Pitt students took the best possible attitude
a.fter that victory. iVVhereas the Duquesne
rooters, cut class, over-ran Alumni Hall walls
and lawns, paraded the streets, crashed down-
town movie palaces, and generally carried‘
their pep too far after ‘last year’s Duquesne
victory, students here passed up the Pitt vic-
tory with commendation for the team and a
look forward to future football victories.

This game tomorrow ﬁgures to be ahard
"battle. But, for the Sutherlandmen it is only
one more game in a long series of tough ones.

Generally, the University, appreciating’ a
hard-fought victory‘ over a previously uncon-
quered team, permits a football holiday.

I But, withthe VV_isconsin, Notre Dame, Ne-
braska‘, Carnegie Tech, and Duke- games com-
ing up, this hardly seems the time for it. A11d
so, with what amounts almost to a_ promise
from the University that a holiday‘ will be al-
lowed for a later, important home game, stu-
dents will doubtless shower commendation
upon the team, in case of victory tomorrow,
and will attend class on Monday as usual.

And ‘then, Fordham may win. I

Exhibit
Review

By Austin Hay .

Exhibits of the original etchings, litho-
graphs, woodcuts and stencils which recently
had a showing in the Cathedral’s ‘Fine Arts
Gallery, gave ample evidence of the extent to
which present day artists have abandoned the
recent practice of just creating pretty pic-
tures without the relation to life about them
and have returned to the sounder practice of
telling a story in pictorial terms.

The present—d.ay American artist is using his
brilliant talent to create art for the public’s
sake—-to create pictures that tell a story of our
times and our people as truly as the work of
our novelists, playwrights, and poets.

Among the items of this exhibit was Rock-
well Kent ’s, “And \Vomen Must VV'eep.” A
woman is shown standing on her doorstep
about to re-enter her home. Beyond :1 picket
fence we glimpse a departing ﬁgure. We sense
the desolation that. awaits her beyond the
closed door, the lonel_v emptiness that already
is creeping into her heart. It is the poignant"
story of wan accomplished in a lithograph that
is beautiful and superbly decorative in design.

J. J. Lankes’ beautiful woodcuts, “Sunday
Afternoon” and “Haying,” are more than just
landscapes. They tell stories of old Virginia
farm land.

Another iinforgettable story-telling picture
of today is Joe Jones’ “\Vasteland.” Here we
are shown the desolations of the dust bowl. It
tells the story of rugged indiviclual.ism run
ragged, erosion of abandoned farms, of wind-
blown destruction. It is truly inore effective
than any economic essay on the subject.

But‘ by no means are all of the pictures in
this exhibition as provocative in theme as those
mentioned. In far different mood is "Waldo
Pierce’s robust lithograph made from his oil
painting which hangs in the Vfliitney Museum
of American Art in New York City entitled
“Circus on the Move.” Iere we have the
rush of horses and wagons, the tramp of ele-
phants and flapping of tents telling a story to
which young and old alike will thrill.

In “St. Nicholas” Mabel Dwight tells a
story rich in humor and fantasy of the patron
saint. The picture is instinctive in imagina-
tion, playful, benign, jolly. No less imagina-
tive and fanciful is Waiida Gay’s “Fairy
Story” in which are epitomized all the fairy
stories in the world.

Reginald Marsh is represented with a mas-
terful rendering of the “New York Skyline”
which is of added technical interest in being a
combination of pure etching and engraving.
Those who are interested in the bean .y that an
artist can elicit from the modern industrial
scene will take pleasure in the stunning
aquatint “Steel Mill” by Harve_v‘Sternberg.

These and many-other works in the exhibi-
tion are pictures that "average men and women
can understand, appreciate and enjoy. '

‘_i.

" ing war we may get into,‘or the stat
‘ tional“'bud'get.

W    
hat Hangs , Over,

By Clarence “Wible

One of the local downtown newspapers is
getting pretty worried about the liquor situa-
tion. It seems that some of our jovial tavern
keepers are not playing the right kind of ball

I" with the State Liquor Control-Board. They

are serving drinks to minors, presenting ques-
tionable entertainment, and are pushing cer-
tain brands of liquors-—for a price.

\'\’e do not doubt‘ the existence of these evils.
VVe do doubt, however, the sincerity of the cru-
sading zeal of this newspaper. '

‘It is possible that the publishers have sons

and daughters whom they want td protect

‘from the -ravages of strong drink. If the case
is such, their altruism is to be admired. But
if their sons and; daughters answer to the
names of dollars and cents, their hypocrisy is
to be deplored.

A newspaper is almost wholly dependent on
advertising. This statement is obvious enough.
it’ is also quite apparent that since the repeal
of Prohibition’, the volume of liquor advertis-
ing that is carried on through the medium of
our local newspapers is proving sufficiently re-
munerative to the publishers of the newspapers
to cause them to entertain more than a casual
interest in the current‘ liquor situation. The
recent articles on the chiseling tavern keepers
are the inevitable fruit of this selﬁshness on
the part of the newspaper publishers.

The publishers are making two big mistakes;
they are not only straddling. the fence, they are
straddling too much of the fence. They are
trying to align themselves with the forces of
righteousness in their fight against the alleged
evils of the local liquor business, and at the
same time they are trying to keep the money
resulting -from liquor and tavern _ advertise-
ments rolling into the coﬁ‘ers. They fear a re-
turn of Prohibition if the conditions are not
improved. .Therefore, they are jumping on the
crusade band-wagon, not for the sake of re-
form itself, but for the money that the liquor
traﬁic means to them.

It is regrettable that these evils are being
pointed out by such questionable authorities.
It is even more regrettable that the publishers
of this newspaper, masquerading under a dirty.
halo of false righteousness, continue to look
out for the almighty dollar at the expense of
the reading public. "We hope that they are not
fooling everyone.

But, of course, they may have sons and
daughters . . .

(7Ed.-Wnote :  Thisasis: .-tl1e;I:ﬁrst=: of
-a. -series of six articles to ap-
pear in the at Pitt News '=~on'. the
gr e a. ti Pittsburgh composer,
Stephen Foster.)

tcresting of the many items in
the Foster _I.I'a'll Collection is
‘Stephen’ Foster’s Book of Orig-'
inal Manuscripts which makes
the composer seem a real, flesh-
and-blood_ person, instead of a‘
shadowy historical ﬁgure.

The manuscript book consists
of 226 pages of coarse paper,
bound‘ between board covers.
For a space of ten years, Fos-
ter wrote the original drafts of
the verses of his songs, and in
a few cases, their music, on
these pages.

He began using the book in Al-
legheny City (now Pittsburgh’s
North Side) on June 26, 1851. We
know this, because an inscription
on the ﬁrst page gives place and
date.

Original manuscripts of ...Fost'er’s

four greatest songs are found in
this book.
— ‘ “Old Folks at Home,” popularly
known as “Way Down Upon de
Swanee River,” was 'written- in
‘1851. This song is one ofthe
most widely-known songs. in the
English language.

The ﬁrst draft shows the title as
-“Way Down Upon de Old ‘Planta-
tion.” The ﬁrst line reads: ,

“Way down upon de Pedee.rib-
ber.” _

There actually is a’-Pedee “River”
in South Carolina. But Foster was
not satisﬁed with this name.

The story is that Stephen took
‘ this manuscriptiin to theoffice ‘of
his brother Morrison, in» Pitts-
burgh, infornfed him that he was
writing a new song. about a South-
ern river of two syllables, and had

- selected the name Pedee, which-

did not seem altogether suitable.
He asked Morrison to give him the,
name of some other two-syllabled
river. Morrison suggested the
Yazoo River in Mississippi. Steph-
en rejected it as being too unmus-
ical.

So Morrison ’ took down an at-
las, and the two brothers searched
through the map of the southern
states, hunting for a good river for
Stephen to sing about. Finally
- Morrison discovered an obscure

Up at a mountain health re-

They make miserable faces to

Once-the smug and sick health

like a camp of underweight foot-

morning athletics.

A few are ambitious enough to
hike a little. But they soon return
so as not to miss any of the malic-

the sports’  writers pronounced
tendency of sticking his neck out.

Explanation or no explanation, se-
lecting the winners of Saturday's
games still "holds ﬁrst place as the
Friday morning column ﬁller.

We have decided not to keep an
account of our percentage record
in games won and lost. It would
resemble too closely the Pirate
batting average.

Most of our courage has for to-
»day’s predictions come from the
results of last Week’s games. For
the ﬁrst time this year and for the
first time in a great many Satur-
days, the favorites played true to
form. About the only one who
didn’t feel too good about the
whole thing were the pool oper-
ators, and those who gave seven
points and took the Panthers.

Well, here goes.

PITT TO VVIN

Pitt-Fordham — In Manhattan
they have a proclivity to minim-
ize the power of those who play
in the hinterlands. Consequently,
Pitt’s slim 6-0. drubbing of Du-
quesne has lessened Broadway
faith in the Panthers. And Ford-
ham’s bright offensive showing
has given the Rams a boost.

Just the same, Pitt is overdue
to break out in a real football
-sweat and look like the team they
really can be. They came close to
it last week, but didn’t quite hit
it. Let’s call the score. Pitt, 13-‘-
Fordham, 7.

_Notre Dame - Carnegie Tech —-
We can’t help. feeling sorry for
Brother Bill-' Kern. All the breaks
have gone against him. Tomorrow
will be no different. The Irish
should be ﬁghting mad and with it
they should. have a little too much
for the Tartans.

Yale - Army-—Rich in backﬁeld
material, Yale is a strong team on
paper. All it has lost is Larry
Kelley, who won four games him-
self last year. In place it has the
greatesthalfback in Yale history,

State Teachers’ college harriers,
at Indiana, Pa. it
Early this morning when -most
everyone else was rolling over in
preparation for that last hour of
sleep, the Panther varsity harriers
with coach Carl Olson and man-
ager Carl Ulrey leftthe Stadium
for the Michigan metropolis.
Olson took along seven runners
to run against the toughest aggre-
gation of cross-country men that
the Pitts have faced this year. Al-
though the Wayne boys were easily
conquered last year in Schenley
Park by a 15-40 score, the meet
shapes up very different this year.

FLAT COURSE

Wayne has the advantage_ of
running on their own ﬂat course,
a course that may trouble the Pitt
boys who are used to running over
a hilly course like the Schenley
Park layout. A '
’ Another point in favor of the
automobile city boys is thejn__um-
ber of veterans on _ each team.
Wayne can boast having ﬁve men
returning. from the -’.36 varsity.
squad, while Coach Olson. finds
himself with only one veteran, Al
Zamborski. ' - " ' ' ’ —

Olson has__been upland downall

way down. When he remembers
the score last year when Wayne
had practically the same team that

_ n fact he has been undecided
about theoutcome of- the’ meet
that Assistant Coach James Potts
suggested that he toss up a two-
headednickle and, if it comes

Clint Frank, a sure-ﬁre All-Amer-
ican bet. Frank will lead the way
to a Yale victory over its strong-
est opponent this season.

A TOSS-UP

Duke-Georgia Tech-—-Those Blue
Devils were tied by Tennessee last
week, but the Vols are plenty
tough. Georgia Tech: unbeaten,
has taken up where they left off
last December with a surprise win
over California. The Rambling
Wreck has enough to wreck any
coach’s happiness. This game is
a toss-up. We want Duke to win
so we’re calling it.

N orthwestern-Purdue —- North-
western was greatly over-rated
last year because of a freak win
over Minnesota. They are in the
same spot this fall. Purdue, minus
Noble Kizer, is not too healthy
itself. But, we’re counting on Ce-
cil Isbell to break loose for the
Boilermakers’ _ first victory.

Texas-Arka»nsas.—'l‘exas has in-
vested a whole lot" of money in its
new football set—up. It won't be.
enough to stop the'Southw_estern_
Conference champions. The Razor-
backs, after, last Week’s unex-
pected defea't,’will lead the Bible-’
men into the shadow of defeat.

Missouri - Michigan —- Are we
nuts? We feel like taking the Wol-
verines. Better judgment says that
the Gophers ‘can’t play three bad
games in a row. It’s Bei_rman’s
boys ‘by sheer power only.

Carlson: Looks
F or Eioormen

If you want to rise, youngﬂman,
go up to the Stadium on Novem-
ber 1, 2, 4, or 5 and show Dr.
“Red” Carlsonhow you can play
basketball. The University’s bas-
ketball coach is looking for good
men, who, haven’t had a chance to
show what they can do with a ball
and a basket.

All you have to do is to take
your application over to the stu-
dent health service office, in the
Fall; Clinic, round up -your own
equipment and show up at the sta-
dium ﬂoor sometime around 3
o’clock. First come, and you get
in the game’ ﬁrst.

As ‘;_soon‘ as ten have come, a
game will begin, playing eight
minute quarters. Meanwhile the
next ten will be getting ready. As
the ﬁrst teams rest, then the sec-
ond game will play a quarter. In
this way Coach Carlson expects ‘to
have about three games played
every hour and a half. '

This means that everyone Will
play. ’ First stringers all, no
“subs” or other time wasting. Y_ou_
are guaranteed a chance to show

JAYVEES IN INDIANA

Although in doubt as to whom
he would take to Detroit with
him, Olson ﬁnally decided upon
Al Zomborski, Ben and Cassimir
Kopec, John Emens, Bob Cogs-
well, Bill McKee, and Joe Krist-
ufek.’

James Potts will take the Pitt

against the teachers. The race
will be run oﬁ during the half of
the Indiana-Clarion footb all

will start and ﬁnish on the football
ﬁeld, but no one knows where
they’ll go between times.

Bob Follette, Anton Skureenski,

bright, Paul Clifford, and Nick
Angelucci will make up the jun-
ior varsity squad with trainer
Herman Bearzi going along for

Freshmen
Outrun

Langley

‘ By defeating Langley High
school 17-38 Wednesday afternoon
. in "Schenley Park, the Panther
yearling cross-country squad made
it known -that Coach Carl Olson
does not have all of the better Pitt
harriers on his varsity squad.
Olsonhas six very good fresh-
! man cross-country runners in Am-

3 merman, Turner, Roland, Boulan-
‘ gel‘, and Standish. In fact they
are so ‘good that Olson runs only
three ‘of the sextet in each meet.

Wednesday it was Ammerman’s,
Turner’s and Nurmi’s turn to run,
and run they did. Taking the lead
in the very ﬁrst half mile they
never relinquished it from there
in.

Ammerman ﬁnished ﬁrst for
Pitt in the time of 12:18 for the
two-mile Schenley Park course.
Turner and Nurmi were not far
behind Ammerman and took sec-
ond and third. '

' Ted Dobrowolski ran the best
race for Langley, ﬁnishing only
two seconds behind Nurmi to take
fourth for the high school boys,
the only place they took in the
ﬁrst ﬁve. Hahnel, and McCabe
took ﬁfth and sixth for the Panth-
er cubs"to_. clinch the meet.

ALEX RETURNS

Returning to Fordham football
this year are the pillars of that
famous “seven blocks, of “granite.”
Alex Wojciechowicz, All-Amer-
ican center, who personally stop-
ped the Panthers on the goal line
in last season’s game, is back
again.

Al Barbartsky, who the Panth-
er players rated as the best tackle
they played against, and Ed Fran-
co, who the All-American pickers
selected as one of the best in the
nation, will be in theline tomor-
row.

Fordham has two backﬁelds.
The startingone is composed of
seniors and juniors, the other one
being made up of sophomores.
According to New York writers,
both are of equal caliber, which is
plenty good.

Leaving Pittsburgh by Pullman
last’evening, the Panthers will be
quartered at the Westchester--
Biltmore Country Club when they
«arrive until a few hours before
the game. This is the same habitat
they have frequented in their pre- ‘
vious two visits to the Metropolis.‘

Considerably dissatisﬁed with
the way his team has been acting
on the gridiron, Sutherland has
been spending the week in bring-
ing his team to a point where
their blocking and defensive work
will be more effective.

 Fraternity Rushing

T0 Begin‘ Monday

Varied Program

Before Bidding 

Thirteen men’s fraternities
have completed plans for fall
rushing, which is to begin at 8
o’clock lllonday morning. ‘ff

Most of the rush week plans
include informal lunches and
dinners where rusliees are en-
tertained at fraternities and
meet the ‘fraternity members.
Plans have been made for theater
parties, smokers, alumni nights,
and swimming parties, in addition
to the house dances on the final
rush week nights.

Robert R. Corley, assistant dean
of men and faculty adviser to
fraternities, stated yesterday that
“freshmen should take advantage
of the invitations issued by fra-
ternities in order to see what they
are like and to decide which group
they wish to join."

From the beginning_ of the
school year ‘until rush week no
fraternity is permitted to Contact
any new student at the University
on fraternity affairs. However,
beginning Monday morning and
continuing to 2 o’clock Sunday
morning. October 24, fraternities
may entertain rushees, with few
i'cst1'icticns.

One 2--~.:i=~ ction is that no rushee

of a member or pledge of a frater-
nitjgoyer night. Another restric-
tiori ;-is»: that the events of the last
nighit of rush week must be held
in the chapter houses. This;condi-
tion will mean, as in former years,
that all fraternities will plan house
dances for that night.

‘ Bidding period is from Sunday
morning, October 24, to Monday,
November 1, at 5 o’clock. During
this week. fraternities submit

dean of men’s office, where all
freshmen who have received bids
will be interviewed. There they
may make known their fraternity
choice. At 5 o’clock, November 1,
the new pledges go to the house of
their choice.
I-F COUNCIL RULES

Rushing ._ rules ,_were made by
the Men’s ‘Fraternity Committee,
composed of administration and
faculty members and the execu-
tive committee of: Interfraternity
Council, -with the: recommenda-
tions of the entire Council.

Rules were accepted by repre-
sentatives of the 13 fraternities in
Interfraternity Council. The ex-
ecutive committee of the Council
appointed Lawrence Orr, C39, Sig-
ma Chi, as rushing chairman. It is
his duty to coordinate the rushing
of_the various groups and insure
cooperation.

Students
Buy Less
This Year

(Continued from Page One)
did last year for the things you
buy?” students responded in a
mighty concert, “Yes.” About one
per cent of those polled thought
prices had not gone up.

To the second question, “Is your
income (in U. S. dollars) greater
than, less than, or the same as, it
was last year?” replies were dis-
tributed, with a _plurality of 39 per
cent asserting that their income
was the same. A larger income
was acknowledged by 35 per cent,
while 26 per cent declared their
actual cash—in-hand was less.

More women are getting along
on the same amount of money as
last year than men, possibly be-
cause of the fact that women can-
notso easily supplement their al-
lowance with outside earnings.
College students are possibly a lit-
tle more prosperous than those of‘
the other three schools, but the
difference is slight.

Ranged according to class, sen-
iors fare slightly better than jun-
iors, and juniors slightly better
than sophomores, in, comparison
with their circumstances of last
year. No criterion exists by which
to judge the relative prosperity of
freshmen.

PURCHASING POWER

“Is your Fpurchasing--4 -power’,
greater this year than it was last?”
Respondents answer “No!” by a
vote of 82 per_cent to 18 per cent,
which indicates .that~ for the most
part even those students V with a
larger irfcome do not feel that the
increase has been sufficient to put
them on a higher economic plane.
Answers again show thatthe mar-
gin of prosperity increases from
the sophomore to the junior to the
senior classes. . 1 i

In aiﬁrmation of their stand that
they are a bit__ more impecunious,
rather than more prosperous t han
last year, students, by a count of
80 per cent to 20 per cent, declare
that they are not spending a larger
share of their income on “pleas-
ure” this year (dates, books, mov-
ies, refreshments, automobiling,
hobbies, etc.). The latter ﬁgure
suggests, however, that some peo-
ple who are no better of}? are en-
joying themselves more, perhaps
cutting down on necessities.

The total spent by men students
on amusements and dates is the
largest item of expense, apparent-
ly constituting about 24 per cent
of the total outlay, while 20 per
cent of it goes for refreshments, 10
per cent for movies, 16 per cent
for automobiling, 13 per cent for
books, and 9 per cent for hobbies.

What puts the biggest hole in the
men’s pockets is for the women no
cause for worry, as the ladies
spend only six per cent of their
money on dates. Evidently ice
cream sodas, sundaes, candies, etc.,
are the rule with them, as 30 per
cent of their spending money goes
for refreshments. Movies are next
in importance, claiming 24 per
cent against 18 per cent for the
men. _

Books are popular with the wo-
men, taking 18 per cent of their
total outlay, while hobbies, such as
knitting, require 15 per cent. Au-
tomobiles are the item of least
expense, taking 7 per cent, against
16 per cent for men, who, it is sug-
gested, areunable so easily to'per-

Carlu Designs
French Room

Jacques Carlu, noted Parisian
architect, has been selected as de-
signer for the French room in the
Cathedral of Learning. The se-
lection was announced by the local
committee, which also reported
that three-ﬁfths of the money nec-
essary for construction has been
raised.

Mr. Carlu is director of the
school of architecture at Fontaine-
bleau, France, and is the chief
architect of the new Palace of the
Trocadero. He received the pre-
mier grand prize of Rome for his
work.

“First Empire” design will be
used in the French room. The fur-
nishings will be authentic, and the
original simplicity of lines, sheer
beauty, and purity of design will
be preserved. Neverthless, the
furniture will be strong enough to
withstand classroom usage.

The local French committee will
sponsor its first event of this year,
the Bal Tabarin, November 5.

ANDERSON SPEAKS

The International was formally
opened last night by the annual
Founder’s'Day exercises commem-
orating Andrew Carnegie. Max-
well Anderson, author of this sea-
son’s “Star Wagon,” was the prin-
cipal speaker. At the conclusion
of the program, the list of winners
was announced and the audience
invited to the galleries.

Thirteen nations, represented in
the 1937 International, have con-
tributed 407 paintings; 300 by Eu-
ropean and 107 by American art-
ists. Almost a hundred more art-
ists are included this year than
appeared in the show last year,
which was limited to six nations.

The exhibition, which will
continue through December 5, will
introduce 89 new artists. The
galleries will be open daily from
10 a. In. to 10 p. m. and on Sun-
days from 2 p. m. to 6 p. m.
