UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

AAUP Panelists Back
‘Bill of Student Rights,’

See lncreas-edAttention

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ
“There is no doubt that the question of students’ rights
is one that will become of increasing attention to the uni-
versity,” said Professor David Landy of the anthropology
department, moderator of the American Assn. of Univers-
ity Professors panel discussion on Students Rights Wednes-

day.

The ﬁrst panel m-ember to speak, Jack Critchﬁeld, Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs, presented the position of the AAUP, as stated in the
“Student’s Bill of Rights." The bill provides for: freedom of access
to higher education, the students rights of expression in the class-
room, protection against disclosure of information other than

‘grades without the students permission, freedom of association,

/freedom of inquiry and expression, independence of student pub-
lications, off-campus freedom of the university student, and ap-
peal procedure against disciplinary action.

Critchﬁeld commented that at the University, there has
been little to implement, other than thesetting up by S-tudent Gov-
ernment of a University Review Board consisting of three Student

Government senators and three administrators to hear dismissal

cases.

Ken Frederick, president of
Student Government, presented
11 [rights of a University stu-
dent. They were: “freedom of
expression, freedom of press,
freedom of association, the free-
dom to choose speakers and
topics for discussion, freedom
to protest, freedom from dis-
crimination, freedom from dis-
ciplinary action, protection

’ a g a in s t arbitrary regulations,

freedom to participate institu-
tional policy, and freedom of
thought in the classroom.”

“Freedom of thought in the
classroom does not exist at the
University since there is no way
for a student to appeal an arbi-
trary decision by a faculty mem-
ber,” stated Frederick.

Professor. Irma Meyerso-n of
the Sociology Department said
that the Senate Committee on
Student. Affairs was a hopeful
sign, since it sh-owed that “the
faculty is concerned enough
about affairs to set up a discus-
sion."

Pamela Robinson, speaking
for the students, said that stu-
dents unquestionably have
rights, and that the real ques-
tion is whether these rights are
being implemented and whether
the students right to an educa-
tion is being upheld.

Miss Robinson said that a uni-
versity should operate only to

provide -the proper environment
for students and should “stim-
ulate rather than put students
in a mold.”

AWS Demands
Area In Tower C

The Council of the Associated
Women Students (AWS) un-
animouslygp-assed a resolution
Tuesday night strongly recom-
mending that the Women’s Hon-
ors Area residence be maintain-
ed in Tower C. This reco-mmenda-
tion is being sent to Miss Lor-
raine Sibbet, director of Wom-
en’-s Housing, to the dean of
women, the dean of student af-
fairs and the director of hous-
ing.

The resolution resulted from
concern expressed by the AWS
Housing Board, the Tower C
Honors Council and independent
residents of Amos Hall. The
Honors area presently housing
144 selected upperclass women
who set their own living rules
through an elected Honors Coun-
cil, which works with the di-
rector of women’s housing.

The intent of the AWS reso-
lution is to formally present the
student viewpoint to the direc-
tor of women’s housing, and to
encourage serious reconsidera-
tion of the housing situation.

 
   

ATTORNEY MELVIN Belli was emphatic in pointing out that the “Law lRevolt”

is not coddling criminals but protect individual rights.

Famed Attorney Sees Revolt
Protecting Individual Rights

by ANNE DORN

Melvin Belli criticized FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover fo-r “lying when he says he can't prose-
cute criminals.” Belli, prominent lawyer and famed counselor for Jack Ruby, asserted in a Public
Affairs Lecture Wednesday that the recent court decisions do n-ot “eoddle criminals,” as Hoover _

claims, but “protect the accused.”

The laws for prosecution were always on the federal books, according to Belli. Now, due to
the “law revolt,” these federal laws for due process of law under the 14th amendment have been

brought to the‘ states.

This is a result of a Supreme Court decision handed down at the end of the C-ivil War declar-
ing that the states may not practice due process of law as promised by the federal unless all points
of the Bill of Rights were adopted by them. “Everyone of the ﬁrst ten amendments has come over

University Team Scheduled
To Compete in College Bowl

"The search for panelists to
represent the University on Gen-
eral Electric College Bowl has
begun. Dr. James Kehl, dean of
the College of Arts and Sci-
ences, stresses the competitive
aspects of the show. “The Col-
lege Bowl,” he said, “is a game.
It isn’t meant to be a real test
of academic ability. We’ll be

-looking for players with quick

recall .-and strong_ competitive
spirit.”

The University team is sched-
uled to make it’s ﬁrst appear-
ance on the show Jan. 21. If it
wins, it will return to defend
itself against the next chal-
lenger until it reaches the maxi-
mum of five wins. Five game
winners are given a bonus of
$3,000,’ plus a $1,500 grant from
the Gimbles Department Store,
making the total for a ﬁve-game
winner $19,500.

DeGaulle’s Policies -

WPDU Debates Cult ural Revolt

by DON MARBURY

“Resolved that this house
supports the cultural rev?)-
lution of Charles DeGaulle,”
announced the Speaker of
the House. “We will now
hear from the representative
from the government.” The rep-

resentative took his place and
thus began the William Pitt De-

bate Union’s (WPDU) ﬁrst ma--

jcr deba-te of the year.

The prime minister, Thomas
Kane, began by explaining how
some foreign countries had felt

-in the past about American in-

terv_e-ntion in their internal af-
fairs. He used the example of
the Germans who after World
r-It . inedth 

 

  

    

sion, “The Americans are over-

played, oversexed, and over
here.”
“I think,” Kane continued,

“that the cultural revolution is
realistic and in the best inter-
est of the entire world. All De
Gaule’s revolution is, is a re-
volt against the so-called super-
powers. The only reason Amer-
ica is so against De Gaulle is
that our pride is hurt —— De
Gaulle does not act like a sec-
ond rate power.

He concluded with the state-
ment, “America has stood be-
tween many dogs and many
trees and has been showered
upon.”

Vic Papale, leader of the boy-

1 0 tion s oke next “We

        

 

  
      
 

want you to accept everything
just said because it says exact-
ly why we shouldn’t support De
Gaulle,” he said. "Charles De
Gaulle’s campaign is nothing
but a try for self-gloriﬁcation.
His cultural revolution will die
when he dies, because he has
done nothing lasting.” He point-
ed out statements that De
Gaulle had made to prove this
point, such as: “I am France,”
and “The French people are im-
beciles,” He also stated that De
Gaulle opposed many of the
United Sta.te’s policies. “He does-
n't support anything. All he
does is react.” The speaker ci-

Dr. William Panetta, associ-—

ate professor of classics, has
agreed to serve as coach of the
University team. Dr. Panetta

‘and Norman Mulgrave, associ-

ate dean of the College of Arts
and Sciences, will be in charge
of selecting the student panel-
ists.

All University undergraduates
under the age of 25 are eligi-
ble for the panel. Candidates
must have amateur status. Stu-
dents who have received ﬁnan-
cial reward for previous partici-
pation in radio or television pro-
grams are ineligible.

Students interested in appear-
ing in the College Bowl should
apply at 917 CL. Faculty who
wish to recommend students for
the panel should contact Dr.
Panetta in 728 CL.

An elimination test will be
given on Nov. 30 at 6 p.m. in
342 CL. .

For Coach Panetta, the task
of weedin.g through the appli-
cants is only the ﬁrst of many.
“We expect,” said Dr. Panetta,
“to hold frequent pnactice ses-
sions those ﬁrst three weeks in
January. Students will have to
be willing to spend some time
and energy if we’re going to
make a good showing.”

MENTOR APPLICATIONS

Any undergraduate woman
who wishes to be a Mentor
may still get an application
from Mrs. Martin in the Dean
of Women’s Office, 1209 CL.
All applications must be re-
turned to Mrs. Martin by 4
p.m. Wednesday.

 

  

the states.” 'Dherefore, stated
Belli, the states have been able
to adopt the due process of law
amendment.

If anything, “the present law

makes it easier” to prosecute.

valid cases. “We have a good
law now. But the one fault in
our law is the fault in all of us.
We've forgotten the aspects of
neigbhorliness and morality.

Bellie strongly disagreed with
Hoover’s policy to “beat them
(criminals) into su-bm‘iss'ion.”
“Of those «commitin-g their ﬁrst
felony, 80 per cent Will be re-
peaters. Getting tougher o-n
them will only increase, that
percentage.”

He spoke in favor of the re-
hiabilitation program -in penal
institutions. When the criminal

comes before the judge after re- ’

habilitation a changed person,
“then we know who is our
brother and what we should do
with him.”

In addition to criticizing Hoov-
er, Belli also censured Califor-
nia Governor Ronald Reagan.
Unlike Reagan, he upheld the
Court’s right to determine what
is constitutional and what is
not. “It’s a judge’s job to judge,”
he stated. “Legislation is experi-
mental; it’s tested in the
Courts.” He added that the Su-
preme Court is a continuous in-
stitution. It doesn’t have a mili-
tary force to enforce its edicts,
but we accept its judgments.”

Belli emphasized that the Su-
preme Court will always protect
the little man. “If a man think’s
he's been wronged and doesn't
have a pressure group behind
him, he won't get an executive
or legislative hearing. But as
long as the Supreme Court
takes care o-f the least of us, it
will take care of the most of
us.”

Belli believes that “there are
very few \who should be con-
victed that aren’t, and very few
innocent that are convicted.” To
an American, «the -statement,

Last Friday, an ad hoc-

' sistant Dean of Men Louis
McLinden, Assistant Dean of
Women Marcia Buckbee,

I1Chairman of the Student

Government Off-Campus
Housing Committee Jack La

Pietra, and Liberal Arts.

senior Pamela Robinson inspect-
ed three student apartments. A
_check list similar to that of the
Allegheny County Health De-
pantment was used in evaluat-
ing the quality of the residences.

The first apartment visi.te~d
was at 364 Meyran Ave. Consist-
ing of a single room and bath,

‘V the =aIpartment was considered

by the committee to be in ade-

, ’ quate condition, although there

was -an electrical problem in
that ‘the wiring was insufficient

' forfi"!the' number of appliances
' operated.

The other two apartments,

_, ‘however, were considered by the
".-grogup tcpbe ‘quraliﬁedxfor con-»

demnation. -One.‘ the‘ basernent

L’ — i*”*liI)2l.1i «at 336' Oakland Ave., was,

according to La Pietra, “a 
taster.” ~ - A -

. .. “There were ﬁve‘ "varieties of

ceiling tile, not to mention that
the ceiling itself was barely six
feet above the ﬂoor,” says La
Pietra. The apartment is enter-
-ed through the garage of the

f  house and is considered to be
_ below ground level.

V “Also,” states La Pietra, “stray
wires, Iapparently unconnected,
were dangling from -the ceiling

and the kitchen -showed evi-
dence that a “sewer pipe ‘had
le-aked through the acoustical
Itile.”

Still another violation of the
Housing Code at 336 Oakland
Ave. was that -two furnaces
operated in the “apartments liv-
ing room. The code specifies
that furnaces within a dwelling
unit must be contained in a
separate enclosure.

Dean McLinden advised the
tenant of the apparent faults
and suggested that he contact
the Health Department and,ar-
range an official inspection.
Since the tenant is planning to
move in the near future, it
is hoped that he will contact the

‘___l‘Iealth Department to prevent
another student from re-renting

the apartment,
The third apartment visited

is also in a basement, at 17‘

Mawhinney St. According to the

. tenant, a senior at the Univer-
 H — sity, the building is owned by

Carnegie Institute and man-
aged by a real estate agent.

Unlike the basement of 336
Oakland Ave., Ithe Mawhinney
St. apartment had regulation-
Iheight ceilings. However, it too
was considered to be ‘below
ground level.

When the committee entered
the apartment, they found that
a old wringer washing machine,

_ stripped of its wringer, was be-

.ing employed as a combination
kitchen and bathroom sink. How-
ever, this “sink” was located in
the living room. This situation
was described by La Pietra as

‘ “intolerable.”

The apartment had a “fantas-

i _ tic plumbing layout,” La Pietra
,~_)conItinued. The toilet was sit-
 uated in a closet off the living
‘ room, a stall shower was placed

near the stove in the kitchen,
and «the sink, as mentioned, was

_ ii1_the living room. Also in the
 living room was a hot water

,‘heater, which, said Dean McLin-
*}d?'.¥1é

upon examination.”

The main criticism of the
committee with this third apart-
ment was in the furnace, where
it was judged that insufficient
air was provided for combus-
tion. This could lead to both an
exhaustion of the oxygen in the
dwelling and also to a build up
of carbon monoxide. The result
to the tenant could be anoxia or
carbon poisoning, or both.

Like the occupant at 336 Oak-
land Ave., the resident of 17
Mawhinney St. was advised to
contact the Health Department.
He has indicated that if he can
ﬁnd a new apartment he will
move. It is presumed that the
Health Department would pre-
vent the re-rental of the base-
ment by condemning it.

The committee felt that it had
seen a fair representation of
student apartments. Says Jack
La Pietra, “While we saw only
three apartments, we think that
they are typical of what Uni-
versity students are being forced

to. live in because of an acute
- htmsingc shortage;

“The condi-tions—are' both de-

00v00000rr0orr00

plorable and dangerous,” he
continues, “and we feel that
they should be corrected." Cur-
renlly, the Off-Campus Housing
Committee is expanding its
membership to begin a survey
of all student apartments in
Oakland and to formulate a
plan of action.

“Housing is an area that has
only begun to be investigated,”
says La Pietra, “and it is a ma-
jor concern to a great number
of University students; we
should not have students living
in slums.”

Music Hall Hosts Concert

Three British Singers Appear

Norman Kennedy, Lou Kill-
en, and Maggie Kerr-Pierce, re-
garded as the ﬁne-st traditional
singers in Britain, will appear
in concert on Saturday, Nov. 18,
at Carnegie Lecture Hall.

The program, which is under
the auspices of the Pittsburgh
Folklore Society and the Car-
negie Society Ceilidh, will fea-
ture folks songs and ballads
from England, Ireland and Scot-
land.

N ormanKennedy, from Aber-
deen, Scotland, is making his
second appea.rance in Pitts-
burgh. He performed to an en-
thusiastic audience in a concert
at Carnegie-Mellon University
last year. Considered to be the
outstanding young Scot singer,
Kennedy, who is a weaver by
‘profession, combines both the
Gaelic and Lowland traditions
in his style, which was molded
through close friendship with
two lengendary singers, Jeannie
Robertson and the late Annie
Johnston.

Lou Killen, bor.n.,in Gateshead-
on-Tyne, England, is very well-
known in Britain as a result of
his many recordings and radio
and television performances. He
matches a subtle accompanied
singing style on the English
concertina with a repetoire of
vigorous songs and ballads from
Northumbria, an area rich in
mining traditions.

Maggie Kerr-Pierce was born
in Belfast, North Ireland, and
learned her songs in the streets
of that city, and through travel
throughout Ireland. In 1960,
Professor Howard Glasser, foun_
der of the Carnegie-Mellon So-
ciety, heard her perform at Ed-

'-inburgh Un-ivensiaty. He consi- _

 

ders her to be the finest of the
young Irish balladeers. She has
developed an exciting style of
unaccompanied singing.

Concert tickets are $2 each.
They are available at the Skibo
information desk, and may be
purchased at the door on the
night of the concert.

Editorial

    A Question of
  Respectability

 

There's been some verbal exchange lately on the state
of Pitt football. However we predict that nothing construc-
tive and beneficial will result from these talks, primarily
because administrators and faculty simply do not under-

stand the issues involved.
These people believe that certain members of the Ath-

A letic Department are advocating the lowering of academic

standards in admission and curriculum. They b91ieV9. this,
even though coach Dave Hart has been selling the Univers-
ity as the place for student-athletes; even though the fresh-

I - men who will play Notre Dame tonight have better academic

credentials than the freshmen of two years ago.

However, many educators do admit that the foreign
language requirement at the University is not perfect. Not
just for the athlete but for all students. Neither is the phys-
ical educati-on program suitable for producing the proper
quality and quantity of high school instructors who can
effectively serve the Western Pennsylvania area.

We believe research in these two areas would not be an
attack on academic standards. However, we highly doubt

 0 ‘ that sulch studies will be seriously undertaken despite their

value to the University and the athletic program. . .
With no action forseen in that area, we move into the

 controversy of the four school agreement which limits schol-
A arships and prohibits red-shirting. Athletic Director Frank

Carver believes that 25 football grant-in-aids per year is
sufficient to play major college football. Hart feels that 30

A schoarships, an increase -of 20 over four years, would help

in three crucial areas.
It would enable the unliversity to recruit on a broader

- basis for the student athlete. It would enable the freshman

team to practice by themselves. And it would provide suf-
ficient depth to the squad to insure adequate replacements
in the inevitable event of injuries.

But Chancellor Posvar’s remarks, ostensibly encourag-
ing on the subject of increased aid to student athletes, were
apparently mislinterpreted by members of the press. It ap-
pears now that the University will remain in the ludicrous
agreement which prevents the healthy growth of Pitt foot-

7 ball. We advise everyone to keep the pact in mind two years
from now when it will leave Hart the grand total of 12-16
freshman football players.

With nothing going to be done about the agreement, it
seems to us imiperative that every recruit must therefore
be one of the top student-athletes in the country. That in-
volves money to finance a nation-wide recruiting program
and it means first class facilities which would attract the
best to the'University. _

Right now, the University has neither. The football

 ‘ . practice field is a disgrace to any football team at any level

of competition. If the new fields are ever completed by the
General State Authority, (they were supposed to be ready
in 1965), they will still be far from first class. And if dormi-
tory construction destroys Trees Field before the new fields
are completed, maybe the football team will conduct spring
practice on the Bridge to Nowhere.

Couple the intolerable practice field situation with a

0 disgraceful training table, a shabby dressing room, and an

inadequate equipment room and the University’s football
program by itself would rate third class at best.

We’re curious to know if professors would enjoy teach-
ing ‘in -dilapidated classrooms with 50 students squeezed into
a room meant for ten? Is the University being fair to its
coaches and players?

We’re curious to know how the Athletic Department’s
budget compares with those of the schools on its schedule.

We’re curious to know if anyone cares enough to be
respectable. ‘

History of War

 

The Future of Man

WAR IS the ugliest of man’s institu-
tions. But wars will not cease to exsist be-
cause man will never learn to live peace-
fully with his neighbors.

The history of man indicates that war
has been vital institution in the past. Ac-
tually, war was a final
diplomacy between peo-
ples.

Prehistoric research
clearly indicates that
man engaged himself in
many wars. These obvi-
ously primitive wars serv- g
ed as a device to settle -
the differences between '
neighboring clans.

The Institution of war
grew steadily in fre- .
quency and magnitude as man improved
his technology. In the ancient era,_ iron
weapons were introduced. With this in-
troduction, man expanded his ability to
kill his fellow man. Consequently, war be-
came more costly and destructive.

The middle ages were marked by many
wars. Nobles attacked their fellow nobles
in order to gain territory and power. And
the deaths mounted.

The origin of the national state gave
the institution of war an increased mag-
nitude. War was no longer identified with
peoples or nobles; whole nations were vic-
tims of war. The French battled the Ger-
mans, the Germans extinguished the Poles,
and Poles fought the Russians.

Yet, the 20 century has so far been the
most hostile era in man’s history. Terri-
torial rivalries and conflicting alliances
thrusted Europe into World War 1. Na-
tion joined Nation in an attempt to sub-
due their enemies.

The Advent of World War I, brought
the introduction of air power. Thus, pilots

Pittsburgh Loyalty

 

by Paul Stoller

indiscriminately dropped bombs on the
enemy populations. And the shrapnel kill-
ed women and children.

The impact and horror of World War
I was so great that man attempted to cre-
ate a treaty that would end all wars. Need-
less to say, utopian optimism of the Treaty
of Versailles and the League of Nations
was proven wrong.

World War II erupted with great fury
just 20 years after the Versailles confer-
ence. Man had feverishly attempted to
prevent war. He failed. 

Since World War II, man has failed
time and time again to prevent war. Just

like the League of Nations, the United Na— '

tions has become a hapless organization
that has not kept the peace.

More importantly, man has now.mas-
tered the atom. This adds a new dimen-
sion to war. Now man can completely de-
stroy himself. As never bef‘ore, govern-
ments must take great care in their diplo-
matic deliberations. War can no longer be
considered as an institution to settle na-
tions’ disputes.

War and the horrifying facts of ther-
monuclear war have a direct bearing on
the Vietnamese conflict. Today, the state
of affairs in Vietnam is at a very danger-
ous level. The U.S. has three alternatives:
North Vietnamese invasion, negotiation, or
withdrawal. -

Should the U.S. decide to invade North
Vietnam and bomb Haiphong harbor, it
would create a situation. that could very
well trigger nuclear war.

The noted historian, Arthur M. Schles-
inger, Jr. haspredicted the U.S. will ex-
tend the war to the north and become in-
volved in a war with Red China.

By taking such an action, the U.S. will
take the fate of man into its hands. The
fate of mankind lies in the sensibility of
man to limit his wars.

An Away Game at -Home

by Michael Brourmanx

ticular aura which sur-

 

Only the dim echo of the
swirling wind can be heard
in the Stadium some thirty
minutes after the action
ends. The hollow bowl
which had been filled al-
most to capacity is empty
and dark.

There are two ways to

tell that it had been a Notre-

Dame crowd. One can stand
in the empty aisles and list-
en as the wind sends the
thousands of empty beer
bottles crashing into the ce-
ment steps. Or one can look
outside, into the area sur-
rounding the dressing room,
and survey the pandamoni-
um that still reigns.

They are lined up twenty

deep surrounding the Irish-

dressing room, the fabled
subway alumni, waiting for
a glimpse of a hero, friend,
or relative.

Youngsters too small for
school are propped on their
fathers’ shoulders. They all
wear black and gold Notre
Dame Jackets and let out
shrieks of joy when a play-
er approaches. Oldtimers
with Notre Dame hats press
up against the doors, hop-
ing for a chance to shake
hands with one of their he-
roes.

Many are dressed in
gree.n, some right down to
their socks. There are a few
girls with green hair. All
seem trapped by the par-

  

rounds Notre Dame foot-
ball.

Pittsburghers for the most
part, they had cheered each
time the Irish scored, un-
leashing a reverberating
roar that has not been
equaled in the Stadium all
year by Panther rooters.

When a Notre Dame re-
ceiver dropped a sure touch-
down pass in the closing
second of play they cried in
anguish, not so much from
a desire to run up the score
as from the terrifying idea
that a Notre Dame man
could do anything wrong.

And when the game ends,
they all congregate at the
dressing room.

Now it is time for the
Notre Dame players, show-
ered and changed, to come
out. Tom O’Leary tries first.
Before he can take three
steps the crowd lets up a
roar and surrounds him.
Fans clutch at his coat and
try to rip it off as a souv-
enir. O’Leary scrambles
back into the locker room,
slightly disheveled but still
in one piece.

It is so hectic that Tom
Schoen, who an hour earli-
er had stormed recklessly
thijough the Panthers on
his punt returns, nervously
turns to an attendant and
asks, “Isn’t there another
vvay out?”

The crowd thins some-

what as time goes by and

the players grow brave
enough to make their way
to the waiting bus. Still,
Terry Hanratty is mobbed
by youngsters and forced
to sign autographs for
twenty minutes.

It is a tough site to watch

if one is a Pitt fan. The ,

first feeling is one of anger
and scorn for the Notre
Dame crowd whose pres-
sence made the Panthers
feel as if‘ they were playing
an away game.

But, upon reflection, the
anger is probably jealousy;
envy over the fact that No-
tre Dame can fill the Sta-
dium, but Pitt can’t.

However, perhaps the lat-
ter is too much to expect.
The game missed being a
sellout because only 4900
Pitt students showed up
while 7000 were expected.
If the students don’t show,
then why should the city?
‘ There’s a freshman game
with Notre Dame tonight at
Forbes Field. The subway
alumni will be there. To-
morrow is the Army game,
the last home game of the
season for the varsity. Sev-
enteen hundred Cadets will
attend. Pitt students are ad-
mitted to both games free.
If they don’t show, they
won't have another chance.

The Notre Dame crowd
last Saturday may have
been too boisterous and un-
behaved, but the Pitt crowd.

. or lack of it, was a disgrace,

“There is only one childin the world and the child’s name is all children .”

This is the season when millions of_
people of all faiths observe solemn
holy days.

Each faith—-in its own way—recognizes
in its observance the brotherhood of man.

Never before, in theworld's history, has
there been such need for understanding
between members of the human family.

"There is only one man in the world,"
Carl Sandburg has written, "and his name
is all men.

”There is only one woman in the world
and her name is all women.

”There is only one child in the world and
the child's name is all children."

We, 450,000 members of the
International Ladies’ Garment Workers’
Union seek—in this season and all seasons
—to further human understanding. We
seek to unite people of all colors and creeds.
We work together and live together with
mutual respect for our neighbors———at the
next machine, or in the next house.

This spirit has not only helped us
advance our own conditions of working '
and living. It has also contributed to

achieving higher standards among our
friends and neighbors in communities all
over America.

The ILGWU label, sewn into women's
and children's apparel, is our signature.-
Look for it when you buy.

Senior Praises '
Dow Company

Editor, The Pitt News:
In light of all the controver-
sy concerning the presence of
Dow Chemical Company re-
cruiters on our campus, I feel
that there is onebaspect that is
“being ove-rlooked. What about
the students who, because of
their speciﬁc qualiﬁcations, wish-
ed an interview with this com-
pany? If -the University Place-
‘ment Service‘ had vsympat-hized
Qwith the Studentls for Peace and
‘had withdrawn their invitation
to Dow to come onto campus,
then these students would have
,-been denied an opportunity to
have an -interview with an at-
-tractive propsective employer.
«Eoertunately, the Placement Of-
ﬁce, realizing the rights of all
concerned, sustained their llIlVI-
tiati-on, and interested students
were granted interviews.
 Now, one may ask, what war-
monigering student would even
want to talk with representa-
tives of this -supposedly war-
. happy company? The answer is
5 s.tu~d-ents like me, who, with a
major in chemistry, can ﬁnd
an interesting and fulﬁlling jo-b
, in a company such as Dow.

death. It has been said that this
weapon is “illegal,” but, unfor-
tunate though it may be, in war-
time no weapon is really “illeg-
al.” No one can tell me that the
Viet Cong are delicate ‘about
what methods they use for tor-
ture or are selective about who
they murder.

Yes, SFP criticizes Dew, but
they don’t seem to remember
what research team developed
an anti-measles vaccine—-yes, it
was a team from Dow, and they
put it into production for the
beneﬁt of our population.

If the Personnel Department
of Dow Chemical Company sees
ﬁt to offer me a job, I will con-
sider it seriously and I hope
that elements on this campus
are not narrow-minded enough
to consider me a “hawk” be-
cause of my possible willing-

Gittleson Review
Editor, The Pitt News:

Let me say that I was as-
tonished---and this is an under-
statement-———-at Steve Gittles0n’s
Pitt News’ Review (Nov. 13) for
the University Theatre’s pro-
duction of Jllstice without Re-
venge.

After seven paragraphs de-
voted to a synopsis of the some-
what intricate plot of the play,
Mr. Gittleson, in one paragraph,
then tells us the sets were “art-
ful,” the music was “colorful,”
and the performances “deft.” He
closes with a remark about the
poor attendance, and then asks
us to see the play in case we
“have doubts about superior the-
atrical ability on this oampus.”

Fromm Mr. Gittleson’s review,
one wonders how he arrived at
such a conclusion. The people

FOOTBALL FOR SHUT-INS

At next Saturday’s football game while you are sitting
in your choice student's seat behind the end zone, won't
you pause and give a thought to football’s greatest and,
alas, most neglected name? I refer, of course, to Champert
Sigafoos. ,

Champert Sigafoos (1714-1928) started life humbly on
a farm near Thud, Kansas. His mother and father, both
named VValter, were bean-gleaners, and Champert became
a bean-gleaner too. But he tired of the work and went to
Montana where he got a job with a\ logging ﬁrm. Here the
erstwhile bean-gleaner worked as a stump-thumper. After
a month he went to North Dakota where he tended the
furnace in a granary (wheat-heater). Then he drifted to
Texas where he tidied up oil ﬁelds (pipe-wiper). Then to
Arizona where he strung dried fruit (ﬁg—rigger). Then
to Kentucky where he fed horses at a breeding farm (oat-
toter). Then to Long Island where he dressed poultry
(duck-plucker). Then to Alaska where he drove a delivery
van for a bakery (bread-sledder). Then to Minnesota
where he cut up frozen lakes (ice-slicer). Then to Nevada
where he determined the odds in a gambling house (dice-
pricer). Then to Milwaukee where he pasted camera
lenses together (Zeiss—sp1icer).

Finally he went to Omaha where he got a job in a tan-
nery, beating pig hides until they were soft and supple
(hog-ﬁogger). Here occurred the event that changed not
only Champert’s life, but all of ours.

Next door to Champert’s hog-ﬂoggery was a mooring
mast for dirigibles. In ﬂew a dirigible one day, piloted by
a girl named Graffa Von Zeppelin. Champert watched
Graffa descend from the dirigible, and his heart turned
over, and he knew love. Though Graﬁ'a’s beauty was not
quite perfect—one of her legs was shorter than the other
(blimp-gimper)—she was nonetheless ravishing, what
with her tawny hair and her eyes of Lake Louise blue and
her marvelously articulated haunches. Champert, smitten,
ran quickly back to the hog-floggery to plan the wooing.

To begin with, naturally, he would give Graffa a pres-
ent. This presented problems, for hog-flogging, as we all
know, is a signally underpaid profession. Still, thought
Champert, if he had no money, there were two things he
did have: ingenuity and pigskin.

So he selected several high grade pelts and stitched
them together and blew air into them and made for Graffa
a perfectly darling little replica of a dirigible. “She will
love this,” said he conﬁdently to himself and proceeded to
make ready to call on Graffa.

First, of course, he shaved with Personna Super Stain-
less Steel Blades. And wouldn’t you? If you were looking
to impress a girl, if you wanted jowls as smooth as ivory,
dewlaps like damask, a chin strokable, cheeks fondlesome,
upper lip kissable, would you not use the blade that
whisks away whiskers quickly and slickly, tuglessly and
nicklessly, scratchlessly and matchlessly? Would you not,
in short, choose Personna, available both in Injector style
and double—edge style? Of course you would.

 

So Champert, his face a study in epidermal elegance,
rushed next door with his little pigskin dirigible. But
Graffa, alas, had run off, alas, with a bush pilot who spe-
cialized in dropping limes to scurvy-ridden Eskimo vil-
lages (fruit-chuter).

Champert, enraged, started kicking his little pigskin
blimp all over the place. And who should walk by just
then but Jim Thorpe, Knute Rockne, Walter Camp, and
Pete Rozelle!

They walked silently, heads down, four discouraged
men. For weeks they had been trying to invent football,
but they couldn't seem to ﬁnd the right kind of ball. They
tried everything-—hockey pucks, badminton birds, bowling
balls, quoits—but nothing worked. Now seeing Champert
kicking his pigskin spheroid, their faces lit up and as one
man they hollered “Eureka!” The rest is history.

‘Madding Crowd’ Would Not Please Hardy

by PAUL ANDERSON

Kindly put your hand over
the top of this article so that
the movie title is complete-
ly covered. Now write the
title down on the nearest
scrap of paper. Compare.
Did you spell “madding" with
an “en”? Mo-st people do. Isn’t
that maddening?

The title was Thomas Hardy's
idea but the movie isn't. If he
were still alive it might not
have been shot. As it is, Far
from the Madding Crowd can
only induce him to turn somer-
saults in his grave.

The ﬁlm tries to follow
basic Hollywood formula of
widely rea.d novel plus big name
stars equals spectacular success
and ﬁunks.

The story is a basic one. Pret-
ty, innocent girl, Bathsheba
Everdene (Julie Christie), look-

.ing for love, rejects her first

one, Gabriel Oak (Alan Bates),
because she thinks him not good
enough but we all know that the
rugged shepherd's problem is
that he’s too good.

Bathsheba then inherits a
farm and moves from her hum-
ble cottage into a more comfort-
able one where she is courted

She puts him off just. long
enough to meet Sgt. Frank Troy,
a dashing young rogue and se-

a bad one, for Frank soon turns

The tragic death of Fanny,
who was pregnant by Frank,
and the discovery of the affair
by Bathsheba results in Frank

Boldwood, in his joy, throws

of "pinning" a girl is

Sprite bottle caps .

According to an independent survey (We took it
ourselves), a startling new practice is becoming
widespread on some college campuses.

Suddenly, fraternity men are no longer "pinning"
the lovely young things that catch their eye.

Instead, they reach for a bottle of tart,

tingling Sprite--and proceed to "cap"

/ r U the object of
\ XL

through theceremony of opening
Buzzes! Tingles!Bubbles!

All of which makes for a much more moving moment
than to simply "pin" a giT1- .

Then, too, the intimacy of two people engaged
in the act of opening a bottle of Sprite in itself
“leads to strong emotional involvement.

Capped off, of course, by the sharing of a
few moments of delicious abandon.
tingling tartness of Sprite, that is.)

The beauty of the idea is that if the course
of true love does not run smooth, you don't have
to go to the trouble of getting back your pin.

You just buy another bottle of Sprite.

‘Michigan Daily’ Reports

ANN ARBOR, Mich. (CPS)-
.in the wake of a Michigan Daily
report on the ﬁnancial dealings
o-f the Michigan Starte Universi-
ty president and of one of its
vice—pre-sidents, the state latter-
ney :general’s office has an-
no-unced it will rule on -the ques-
.tion of whether or not the two
men have violated the state's
conﬂi-ct-of-interest law.

The Michigan Daily, student
newspaper -at the University of
Michigan, published a copy-right-
ed story Wednesday morning
describing a land sale involving
ellmost $1 million made by MSU
President John Hannah and real
estate dealings ii-nvolving Phil-
lip J. May, MSU’s vice-president
for business and ﬁnance.

After the -story appeared State
Rep. Jack Faxon, a Democrat
from Detroit, requested Asttor\-
ney -General Frank Kelly to
make a ruling on the «conflict-
of-initerest questi-on at MSU.
Wednesday night a spokesman
for the at-torney general said
the ruling would «be made, but
‘that it would probably not be
forthcoming for several weeks.

The main burden of the Daily’s
report on Hannah was not that
he has been involved in a. con-
pﬂict-of-interest violation, but ra-
ther that he has sold a. valuable
parcel of land to the Lansing,
Mich., real estate company that
has 10118‘ been the target of civil
rights groups in the city.

The Urban League and the
NAACP both have made fre-
quent complaints about dliscrim-
inia-tion by the Walter J. Nener
Real Estate Company, the firm
to which Hannah sold his land
last summer, according to the
Daily.

Hannah is chairman of the
US Civil Rights Commission.

The Dai-ly’~s report on MSU
Vice-president May ;said that he
is a member of the board of di.
rectors of the Neller company.
It also reported on May’s con.
nection with a. company that
has had dealings with the Michi-
gan National Bank and the In-
ternational Business Machines,
Inc.

Both the bank and IBM have

financial ties with MSU. Accord-

ing to the Daily, the bank is
MSU’s “chief ﬁscal. agent,” and

. IBM does a “suvbsp’ca.nti-al amount"

1-buss: nirsrsi

 
 

Conflict - of - Interest

but it has since learned that
May was on the board of direc-

:tors of the Michigan National

Bank until September.

The company that has dealt
with the bank and with IBM is
t-he Phil-lip Jesse Company.
May’s wife is secretary-treas-
urer of the ﬁrm, according to

«the Daily.

Gynecologist Answers Questions
Concerning Birth Control Methods

by ALICE GOLDSMITH

Speaking to a capacity au-
dience of interested women
stuldents in the S.U. Ball-
room, Wednesday night, Dr.
Sylvia Wechsler, Pittsburgh
gynecologist, answered ques-
tions concerning sexual rela-
tions and methods of contracep-
tion.

Alt.hough Dr. V’Vechsler frank-

ly answered questions from the
ﬂoor, most of the questions were
submitted previously by stu-
dents through their senior as-
sistant or repre-senutatives of the
Associated Women Students

lAWS), the sponsoring organ-
ization.

Ann Bush, AWS president,
said that she hopes the lecture
will be the first in a series of in-
formative lectures of sex educa-
tion at the University, either
sponsored or cosponsored by the
wom-en’s organization.

Some of the topics discussed
bf; Dr. Wechsler were the psy-
chological aspect-s of attaining
adulthood, functional disorders
such as homosexuality, sterility,
menopause, and the dangers and
ef’fe(-tivcness of birth control
pills.

Although she believes the pill

is one of the safest methods of

birth control, it cannot be used

by everyone. Individuals affect-

ed by epilepsy, migraine head-
aches, active lchronic) asthma,
jaundice, organic heart disease,
kidney disease, hypertension,

diabetes, and thro-mboembolic (a

circulatory disease) are consi-

dered poor risks and are not us-

ually «prescribed the pill.

Since side affects from taking
the pill are relatively rare» Dr-
Wechsler believes that pills are
safer than cars, because over
167,000 deaths were attributed
to aurtomobile accidents last

year.

’ ;Army Goes Bankrupt
  On New Year’s Day

by George Lies
Associate Sports Editor

.Army is in a predicament. Right now they’re pushing
for the Sugar Bowl bid. Specifically because of their 7-1
record. Tomorrow, they must win against the Panthers. But,
let’s say they do. Will they go out and publicize it to the
nation?

Or, if they win, will their athletic department hold-off
on the announcement? Mainly because, Navy is all earsat
this time. The Army-Navy gameis in two weeks, and Navy
might just capitalize on incentive to upset a bowl—bound
Army team. Add that to the ever present spirited rivalry
between the two teams, and one can visualize Army’s pro‘;-

lem. -
IN ITS‘ 78 YEAR HISTORY, Army has
never gone to a bowl. This contrasts Navy’s
appearance in the Cotton and Orange Bowls.
during the sixties. Panther defensive coach
Bill Neal douibts whether Army will ease up
tomorrow, despite the upcoming Navy
game. But he did point out that bowl bids
are funny things.

“It’s my personal opinion that, if we
beat Army, there will not be a bowl an-
nouncement made until _after the Navy
game,” Neal expressed. “They will accept

 

(the bid, but they'll keep it secret until after they meet

Navy.”

Neal speaks from experience. “When I was coaching
at Virginia, we played our last game against Maryland.
Maryland had gotten a bowl bid, but the coach at that time,
refused to accept it, saying, “we have one more game left.”
Wouldn’t you know it, we beat Maryland and knocked them
right out of the bowl.” .

The bowl comm.-ittee turned to Penn State instead. “Rip
Engle, at that time, sent us a letter, thanking us for beating
Maryland,” said Neal. “He also thanked us for the $100,000
Penn State got for going.”

BUT WHAT IF Army should lose tomorrow? A 7-2
mark with their schedule is not exactly a, great drawing

. card, despite Army’s national prominence.

Except for small college foe Rutgers, theonly team on
Army’s schedule that has a winning record is Duke. And
Duke beat the Cadets, 10-7. ’ 1

Army has beaten Virginia, 26-7 ; Boston College, 21-10; -

SMU. 24-6; Rutgers, 14-3; Stanford, 24-20, Air Force, 10-7 ;
and Utah, 22-0.

Last year,’Army had a 8-2 mark. The losses were to
Notre Dame, 35-9, and to Tennessee, 3-8-7. They beat Penn
State, 11-0 last year, but didn’t schedule the Lions this year.
And too, the Panthers fell to first year coach Tom Cahill’s
team, 28-0.

Then Army beat Navy, 20-7, for the 32nd time in 67
games (six tie games) and Cahill was named Coach of the
Year because he built, in one year, a basically sound team.
As he said, when he moved up from an assistant coaching
spot; “he planned to fit the style of play to the personnel.”

ARMY, THUS FAR, appears to score enough points
just to win. “Some people say, they rise to what the occa-
sion demands. Maybe, they would’ve lost, but for that tre-
endous sulrge they always give in games,” Neal remarked.

Commenting on that Army-Navy encounter, Neal re-
called memories once again. “The players do things in that
game they haven’t done all year. They miss assignments, or
they block the wrong people. It’s just a psychological thing;
the players get themselves all worked up."

It’s too bad the Panthers aren’t going to a bowl this
year; they’re just -one of the losing teams on Army’s sched-
ule.

Fighting Irish Frosh Face
Cubs Tonight at Forbes Field

Usually, a policy of “seeing is believing” is the way
wise men judge. But when it comes to Notre Dame football,
a policy of “expecting is believing” seems just as wise.

Everyone knows that Notre Dame has turned out powerful
football teams for many years now. And their power begins with

the fresh-man they recruit each
year. Coach Darrell Lewis does-
n't think that this year will be
any different. He ‘is expecting a
strong Irish frosh.

“Our freshman schedule was
made ‘up so that each team we
face is better than the team be-
fore,” explaimed Lewis. “The
Notre Dame game is our last.”

The Notre Dame coaches con-
ﬁrm Lewis’ expectations.

“This year’s squad,” co-mment- ,

ed freshman coach Wally Moore,
“is different that my '66 team.
We're much smaller this year,
but we’ve got a more aggressive
bunch of boys”,

The Cubs will ﬁnd it hard to
believe this year’s Notre Dame
freshmen are smaller than last
year’s. The Irish frosh have a
defensive line raveragin-g 6-2, 240.

N otre Dame head coach Ara
Parseghian said, “This year’s
freshman team is an average
N otre Dame freshman team.”

WINTER SPORTS PREVIEW

WRESTLING

Rookie Coach Adams Hopes
To Regain Status of the 50’s

by ROY JACOBS

A new spirit is enveloping the
University’s sports programs, a
spirit of renewal and revival. Dave
Hart is bring a new vigor to football, and
frosh coach Tim Grgurich is doing the
same for basketball.

Now, there is another man cast in the
same mold. Dave Adams, a former as-
sistant at Navy and Penn State, has taken
charge of the University's wrestling pro-
gram, and his first team opens its sched-
ule December 2. The varsity’s _la.st two
squads won only a combined four meets,
but Adams is only looking ahead.

“We’d like to get the program back to
where it was,” elaborated Adams. “Pitt
was second in the Nationals in 1957. We’d
like to regain that level or go even high-
er. But it’s going to take a lot of work
and a lot of luck.”

The hard work already is underway.

E The wrestlers, except for the heavy-

weights, have been practicing since the
second week of school. All the heavy-
weights are on, the football team, so
they haven't missed out on conditioning.

“After the Penn State game, we hope
to get quite a few football players,” ex-
plained Adams. “We have no big boys out
now at all.”

Of course, Adams’ main concern is the
material he has to work with right now,
which is, if nothing else, iquite abundant.
Al Traunsteiner and Cliff Zolikoff, all of
last year's first liners are back. Besides
them, the grapplers feature several out-
standing sophomores and a co-uple other
veterans who wrestled sporadically last
year. Right now, the wrestlers’ best spot
seems to be the 123 class.

“We ought to be pretty reasonable at
l23,” analyzed the coach. “We’ve got sev-
eral good boys fighting it out there. It’s
our best weight as far as depth goes.”

Dick Schildt is probably the favorite
right now because of his two year’s ex-
perience, but ‘he is being hard-pressed by
Bruce Unangst, a sophomore who was a
freshman champion at the Navy Invita-
tional Tournament last season. Veteran

, Bill Welker and soph Duff Case also rate

a good look from the coach.

Another area of contention is the 145
class where three men are battling for
the spot vacated by Zolikoff. Dave John-
son, who transferred from J ohnstown mid-
way through the season last year, rates
a slight edge over Ray Tygenhof and
Lance Manley.

“Ron Schuchert at 137 is in his third
year,” said Adams, switching the talk
to a couple of his bright spots. “He could
be one of the better wrestlers in the East.
Pm 100king for him to have a real good
season. Jim Rhone at 152 was the captain
last year. He could have a real good sea-
son.”

Larry Cuba is back after a hard luck

» season at 130, and Tim Trax returns at

150. Randy Kahler, at 177, wrestled as
3 S0Dhomore, but missed all last year be-
cause of a cyst. Adams figures Kahler or
-hm Wampler could place in the Easterns.
Two sophomores, Jack Kuhn (third at the
Navy Invitational) and Paul Allen, are
fighting to compete at 167.

That leaves just the football players
at the Upper Weights. The coach expects
Paul Bergman to wrestle 191 and Terry
"<_’°V'=r at heavyweight before Christmas,
with each dropping down one weight class
after vacation. Tony Truitt or Mike Rak-
lewicz would then wrestle heavyweight.

“They'll have to determine their class-
es themselves,” reflected Adams. “I’m
h0Ding for a 191-pounder and a heavy-
weight. Everything else will be a bonus.”

Still, there’s the schedule to worry

gabout. The matmen face such pefennia]

First Year Wrestling Coach

shall, February 10. And in March, the
Eastern championships return here after
a year in Philadelphia. Adams thinks his
team will do better than last year.

“Last year in the Easterzns, Pitt scored
minus two points, finishing last out of
16,” reviewed Adams. He felt seven dif-
ferent grapplers could place this year.

“It all depends on who from the other
teams wrestles where. I don’t anticipate
that all will place; but they have the abil-
ity, barring injuries and given the desire.”

From that point, it was just a short
jump to talk of the future.

_ “We have a pretty good future,” pre-
dicted Adams. “We’ve got some good
freshmen and some good underclassmen.
This is a big year for us. If we have a
good recruiting year this year, it’ll make
us. In another year or two, we'll let some
people know we’re around.”

The ring of the words is familiar. They
might have been said about any of the
revived sports programs around school.
And that’s a good sign. Maybe it won’t be
too long until wrestling around here is
back at the top.

BASKETBALL

Timmons Analyzes

BROURMAN

Rbomtindball

Basketball coach Bob Timmons
is optimistic. “We hope to break
even,” he says. “This the first good
chance we’ve had at that in a few years.
We have the potential.”

But Timmons is also a realist. He
knows his team has strengths, but he
also realizes that it has weaknesses. Tim-
mons says that he will go primarily with
nine men, giving the cagers more depth
than in the past few years. What are the
strengths and weaknesses of each player?

KEN BOLLENS: “Ken is doing real
well for us,” says Timmons. “I think he’ll
give us his points, but he’s,not going to
get the ball as much as last year.” Last
year Bollens was the varsity’s second lead-
ing scorer. “He has to work mainly on his
defense,” Timmons continued. “His ball-
handlng and offense are pretty good.”
Bollens also has had a tendency to draw
too many fouls.

PETE SMITH: The senior guard is the
team’s playmaker. “I don’t shoot more
because some of the other guys are better
shots,” he admits. His strengths, accord-
ing to Timmons are his defense and his
ability to talk, acting as a court leader.
But, Timmons notes, “he has to go to the
basket more on offense. He has to drive
more.”

CHARLIE HUNT: Timmons is count-
ing on the 6’7” sophomore to provide
strength at center. “He’s just about the
biggest player we’ve ever had,” com-
ments frosh coach Tim Grgurich. What
Hunt needs is to score more. “He has
good moves,” Timmons says, “but he has
a little trouble scoring. He has looked
pretty good on the boards.”

MIKE PATCHER: Another sophomore,
Patcher will alternate at one of the for-
ward posts. “Mike’s going to Play a lot of
ball for us,” says Timmons. “He’s coming
along real well and rebounding real well.
Right now he’s on a par with any of our

' first five. His big problem is just to learn

our offense.”

Fraternity
Phi Eps Beats
Delts, 19-O

Fraternity touch football’s
League “A” ended its season in the
same manner as the season began.
Two more shut-outs highlighted the final
two days of action.

Phi Epsilon Pi grabbed the champion-

-ship honors, blanking Delta Tau Delta,

19-0, on Wednesday. The day before, the
Delts had stopped Pi Lambda Phi, 6-0.
In the title game, Phi Ep was never in

trouble. A punt return, in the first half,"

by Dan Friedman gave Phi Ep their first
touchdown. Steven Talmadge fired to Rick
Abrams for the extra point.

Art Villa opened the second half scor-
ing by hauling in a 40-yard touchdown
pass that was thrown by Talmadge.

Another long pass caught by Villa put
the ball on the one yard line. Talmadge
ran in for the final score and Phi Ep fin-
ished their season undefeated with a 4-0
record.

The Delts’ semifinal win was in a
strong defensive battle. The only touch-
down came when Chuck Wilson fired a
pass to Tom Barnes. Wilson tossed to John
Anderson for the conversion point and the
win that advanced the Delts to the finals.

Dormitory

Stratford
N ips, Panther

Stratford House grabbed _the
Dorm Football League champion-
ship Tuesday with a 15-0 win over
Panther House. Pleasure Palace grabbed

third place in the final standings by beat-
ing Mad House, 15-0, in a consolation
game.

Stratford’s win made its final record
in in the second quarter when Nick Ger-
vase ran 40 yards for a touchdown after
taking a pass from Steve Solnoki. Solnoki
then threw a conversion pass to John
Clifford. Clifford ran 60 yards for an in-
surance touchdown after taking another
pass from Solnoki in the third period. Ger-
vasi ran for a two point conversion to end
the scoring.

Pleasure Palace was locked in a score-
less duel with Mad until the fourth period
when Cliff Brown threw a 25-yard touch-
down pass to Bob Thompson. Dick Leggatt
took a conversion pass from Brown.
Thompson and Brown then combined for
another touchdown, with Brown running
4-2 while Mad was 3-3.

Stratford scored all the points it need-
wound up 4-1. Pleasure Palace finished at
five wins’ and no losses, and Panther

,a two point conversion play V

 

  
   

 

 

“Starters”

KEN BOLLENS
Expected To Score

ROB McFARLAND: Another soph, he
will alternate with Patcher and Bollens.
“Rob’s big problem is defense,” 'I‘immons
says. “He’s handling the ball real well,
and he shoots real well.” McFarland came

on strong for the frosh at the end of last
year as he became accustomed to the
switch from the high school zone to the
man-to-man.

BOB PETRINI: Tall for a guard at 6’3”, ,

Petrini, another soph, should be able to
score from the inside against smaller" op-
ponents. He is also a good outside shot.
“He shoots real well,” comments Timmons.
“His defense is pretty good. We've got to
get him talking more to get someone be-
sides Pete who can run the ballclub. Right
now Pete s our only leader.”

KEN KALATA: A junior, Kalata was
moved from forward to guard last year.
That is where he will play this year also.
“Len has to improve his outside shoot-
ing more,” says Timmons. “He could also
use more aggressiveness.” '

STEVE STEVENSON: A swing man, he
can be used at either forward or guard.
At guard, he is able to take his man in-
side, but he lacks the good outside shot.
“Steve plays real good defense,” notes
Timmons, “but, like Lenny he has to im.
prove his outside shooting.”

TONY Del-I510; “T0nY’S big trouble is
his defense,” Timmons explains. “He has
a tendency to grab at a guy instead of
playing him. He's got a good shot and can
drive and he could help us.”

The cagers have a long way to come_
Timmons admits that. But, for the first
time in a few years he believes he has the
material to work with.‘ And that’s a hope-
ful sign. ’ s . A i

 

 

 
 

 

 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

W'_fOl‘i their pairing -w,it11\s(}”_p_

by DAVE TIERNAN

Spirit is high for tomor-
row’s final soccer game at
Penn State and the-re is a pos-
sibility that the ﬁve seniors who
will be playing their last game
will be in the starting line-up.

Seniors Gary Foertsch, Joe
Kruth, Pete Snyder; Blaine Popp
and Terry Weiler will lead the
team’s attempt to ﬁnish the sea-
-son with a win; the home ﬁ-
nale last week was a 1-0 win
over Kent State.

Halfback Ernie Mouen is still
in -the hospital and will miss
the game. Although Ron Milecki
did a good job as Mouen’s re-
placement against Kent State,
coach Leo Bemis said he may
move Dave Shimpeno, offensive
leader this year with four goals,
to halfback and start the sen-
iors.

In preparation for the Lions,
the booters have been working
in regular scrimmages all week,
despite the snow and cold
weather. The cold snowy weath-
er hasn’t dampened the team’s
spirit, though.

“The team is in real good spir-
lit,” Bemis noted. “As far as the
game goes, it should be a pret-
ty even game. If our fellows
want the game, they can win,”
he said.

Penn State will bring a 4-4-1

‘record into tomorrow’s game.

Three of their victories were
over teams the booters also
faced this season. Penn State
upset West Virginia and West
Chester, both of those teams de-

« feated the booters.

Bucknell lost to both teams;
ggu hastens- '._iii.1in$i_.§-9-..a3zs1
_ winning, 3-1. Craig Rey-
nolds, head coach at Bucknell,
forwarded a report on the PSU
team to Bemis. In the report,

,Reynolds said, “If you team

plays as well against Penn State
as they did against us, you will
beat them.”

Re-nolds referred to the boot-
ers’ win over Bucknell, a game
in which Shimpeno scored three
goals. Shimpeno also had the
goal in the only other Win this
year; the 1-0 win over - Kent

‘ State.

The booters have lost six and
tied two in addition to the two
wins. The offense has failed to

produce goals consistently this

year, but the momentum of two
wins in the last three games
could carry the booters to vic-
tory.

The defense, which has play-

Swann, of Flanders and Swann, has, with the assist-
ance and encouragement of Professor Tolkien, set
seven songs from The Lord of The Rings to music.
Each song may be sung individually or taken together
as a group to form a song cycle. The arrangements

Dr. George W. Mcbarcn, 71,
one of the greatest fullbacks in
Pitt's history," died Tuesday at
St. Joscph’s Hospital, Baltimore,
after a short illness.

Only two weeks ago Dr. Mc-
Daren came here for the annual
Homecoming Day game against
Syracuse. He attended the Lot-
terman's Club dinner on Fri-
day night, Nov. 3, and was in-
troduced with other members
of the undefeated, untied 1917
team in the Stadium.

Others present that day were

Black Knights, 7-1, Forsee

Bowl In Tecumseh’s Future 

by MIKE BROURMAN
Army has a sweet‘ tooth. lt also has ulcers. Tomorrow
the Cadets will be trying to satisfy one and placate the

other.

Sugar is on the minds of the Black Knights of the Hudson and
Tecumseh, their good luck statue. The Sugar Bowl to be exact

Right now Army is the leading
contender for one of the berths
but to get there on New Year’s
Day, they must get by the Pan-
thers tomorrow.

With a 7-1 record, you would-
n’t think Army coach Tom Ca-
hill would have ulcers. And he
doesn’t. Steve Lindell does, and
it will be Lindell and “Mr.

Clutch” who most likely will de-
termine the Cadets late.

“Mr. (7luteh” is Cadet fullback
Chuck Jarvis, a junior froln

they need three yards, Jarvis
gets ﬁve. When they need ﬁve,
he gets seven. When they need
eight, he makes ten,” says Pan-
ther scout Carl Kokor.

Last year Jarvis lead Army
in rushing with 450 yards in 89
carries, an average of ﬁve yards
per try. He is matching those
ﬁgures this season. Jarvis’ strong
point is his power, although he
has better than average speed.

Steve'Lind'ell is Army‘sUulce’r-
ridden quarterback. A sidearm-
ed through, his unnatural de-
livery keeps the ‘ball low and
minimizes interception+s:‘ Lindell
has a completion record of 60

-percent, and is also “the best

scrambler we’ll see all year,” ac-

Steele. A three year starter,
Young has been the leading pass
receiver for the past two. Tight
end‘ Steel is the number two re-
ceiver.

The Panthers couldn’t contain
Tom Schoen last week, and they
may have just as much trouble
with Van Evans. A 160 pounder,
Evans has been called “the ﬁnd
of the year” at West Point. He
plays halfback, ﬂanker, and re-
turns punts and kickoffs.

Bud Neswiacheny leads the
Cadets strong defensive unit. In
Army’s multiple sets he may
line up at end, tackle, or line-
backer. The defensive unit is
quick and aggressive, a symbol
ot all Army teams.

Three other lettermen, Bob
Gora, Pat Mente, and Elwood
Cohey join Neswiaeheny on the
forward wall. Jim Bevans, and
Kenny Johnson are Veteran
linebackers, while the third man

Onlyi PaulGrcig Earns 

Chance At IC4A Title

by ART R-0SENGAR'l‘ICN
The cross country season reaches its climax Monday
afternoon, when the freshmen and a lone varsity harrier,
Paul Greig, will run in the IC4A Invitational Meet at New York’s

Van Cortland Park.

This meet will pit the bar-
riers against some of the finest
long distance runners of the
East. Over 20 schools are en-
tered in the meet, with Villano—
va a heavy favorite to repeat as
varsity team title holders.

According to coach Jim Ban-
ner, the reason why only Grieg
is representing the varsity is
that, “he was the only one who
earned a chance to run in this
meet because of his consisten’t-
ly tine times and performances
this season.”

Also, Banner feels that “Greig
is the only varsity performer
strong enough to place among
the top ﬁnishers.”

The freshman team has been
working out twice daily for the
past two weeks in preparatiorl
for l\londay's meet‘. “The fresh-
man team. looks pretty good in
practice,” said Banner. “They
worked real hard last week and
are beginning to taper ot'f this

BOB BAZYLAK
Starts at Quaterback

by GEORGE LIES

Imagine the shock of the
" referees when 17 Panther
J players, many of them on
crutches, go to midﬁeld for the
toss of the coin before the
2 Army game at the Stadium to-
morrow at 1:30 p.m.

It’s not exactly like that,

though, but Dave Hart almost
_. had City Hall pass a law to com-
memorate S~enior’s Day. It is
the last home game for 17 sen-
iors, and Hart decided to make
"them all co-captains.
 Heading -the list of cozcapvtiain-s
 are Bob Longo, Bob Bazylak,
V Ray Riadakiovich, and Tom Mi-
‘tr-akos on offense, and Dave
Dake, Terry Hoover, Joe Cur-
rtin, Pau-1 Killian, and Mickey
Depp on defense.

Bazylak, who returns to the
starting lineup after a three
 week absence due to an ankle
 chip, may be just what the Pan-
0 ‘thers need.
5 “Boy, I'm glad to see Baz
(back in there,” quipped Hart.
_ _’ “His presence ju-st radia.tes spir-

it, and I know the boys ‘are glad
to see him return.”
_ Bruzises, injuries, and weath-
er conditions this week have
lim-ited scri-mmages, but “we
 ‘practiced in‘ the quagmire at
_, Trees Field, and I’m glad we
 did,” said Hart. “We had a re-al
L 0 ﬁne practice, and we may as
0 -well work because we may p-lay
A in that stuff Saturday.”

After the Notre Dame game,
many of the Panthers’ players
were badly bruised; but only

year,” said defensive coach Bill
Neal. “Bu.t, never two on the
same team like these boys.”

Lindell, Steel, and Young have
carried coach Tom Cahill’s team
to a 7-1 record, and .a possible
Sugar Bowl bid. But Hart is
pushing f.or a history repeat.

In 1963, Army ventured to the
Stadium in exactly sthe same
situation. The Panthers beat the
C-ade-ts, 28-0, and smashed
Arrny’s bowl hopes. But, that
was the year Fred Mazurek was
he-re, and the Jungle Cats un-
der coach Johnny Michelosen
ﬁnished with a 9-1 mark.

This season, the Panthers
haven’t had an offense which
could score often enough to win
more than one game. Bazylak
directed that win, 13-11, over
hapless Wisconsin.

With Bazylak’s returning to
lead his all sophomore backﬁeld,
Hart may spring a surprise on
Cahill. Actually, Hart has to
worry over whether or not the
Panther defense will be ready.

Coach Neal doesn't even ques-
tion it (though. He just says,
“Don't mention that.” He real-
izes his players may not be
physically ready tomorrow.

“If it would have happened
earlier in the season, it would
be much more serious than it is
now,” explained Neal. “The boys
do have bruises, but like Dave
Drake, A they're. used to tnem.

“One good thing though,”
Neal added. “They are not as
overpowering as Notre Dame or
Miami. We won’t be out-n_1atch-
ed on the ﬁeld. They are quick,
but sometimes this is confusing.

“The reason they look quick
is that -they never stay blocked,”
Neal pointed out. “They kee-p
coming back. They have that
tremendous spirit; that's why
they look quick.”

Another historical reminder
is that Army has never won in
Pittsburgh; just two ties in
1958 and 1960.
mentum going for them,” Hart
said. “That makes it tough.”

It may even be tougher on
the officials, when all the co-cap-
t!ains gather for a decision on a
penalty.

The remainder of those co-
caprtains include Greg Keller,
Mike Raklewicz, who may start
at linebacker against the Ca-
dets, and Mike Elliot, who may
see action in the secondary.

Others, who will dress for
their last home game are Frank
Pecman, Gerry Rife, Mike Cole-
man, Dave Raudman, and Bill
Zurzola.

Although, the seniors are the
only players who remember that
victory over Army, four years
