I-F Council

Discusses

’ Cup Award

 

Scholarship, Athletics, Sing
To Determine Numerical
Basis For Prize

 

Plans for an “All ’Round Frater-
nity Cup” were discussed and a com-
mittee appointed to determine the
numerical basis for award, at the
last meeting of Inter—Fraternity
Council held Tuesday, January 5.

Points are to be determined on
scholarship, athletic ability, inter-
fraternity sing, and on the basis of
the least amount of duplications of
persons participating in activities.

According to Robert R. Corley, as-
sistant to the dean of men, “Coin-
petition-for,,,the cup will extend from
April to April so that the award can
be made at the Spring Festival cere-
monies.” _

The idea of having a competitive
.spirit among the fraternities for such
an award was originally that of Mar-
tin J. Feely, assistant professor of
physical education. The suggestion
had not been acted upon previously
and Mr. Corley presented the idea
to council, who quickly sanctioned it.

A committee composed of David
Grossman, C38; Gerald McCann, C37,
and Harold Byers, C38, has been
chosen to determine what point sys-
tem will be used in selecting the win-
ning fraternity from among the 13
that will be competing for the cup.
They will make a report at the next
meeting of the council which is to be
held at the Sigma Alpha Mu house,
Tuesday, February 2.

A report was made concerning the
Inter-Fraterni'ty Sing held December
16 at Hotel Schenley. Pi Kappa Al-
pha won the sing, with the Delta
Tau Delta team and ‘the Phi Gamma
Delta outﬁt coming in second and
third, respectively. Cups were
awarded to all three fraternities.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon was given first
honorable mention and Sigma Chi
was awarded second honorable men-
tion.

For the past three years, Delta Tau
Del'ta has won first award in the sing.

Rushing season dates have been
changed for the coming semester.
The fraternities will begin rushing
one week earlier than usual, starting
Thursday, February 18, and ending
Sunday morning, January 21, at 2
o’clock. The silence period will ex-
tend from Monday, February 22,
until Thursday, February 25.

YM-YW Hold

Pe a c e Meeting

World peace and its importance to
college students is the topic to be
discussed at an assembly to which
the YM-YWCA has invited all stu-
dents interested in a peace program
The meeting will ‘take place at 2:30
o’clock today in Room 801, Cathedral.

During the meeting plans for a pos-
sible peace program on campus and
for attendance at city peace meetings
will be discussed. The YM-YWCA

interest students in the Inquiry
Forum to be held Monday under their
direction, at which Sherwood Eddy,
world traveler and peace advocate, is
scheduled to speak.

Lydia Shaw, C37, as chairman, and
her committee, which includes Daph-
ne Land, C39, and Jean Delinore,

Gantt To Be Initiated

Immediately after drill today in
Logan Armory, all members of Scab-
bard and Blade, national honorary
military fraterni'ty, must be present,
in uniform and with saber, for an ini-
tiation ceremony for Major H. B.
Gantt, professor of military science.

Unheralded Band

To Feature Dance

“We’re going places,” said Leonard
Levison, C39, president of Druids,
national sophomore men’s honorary
activities fraternity.

Levison was referring to the tea
dance sponsored by Druids and
Cwens, sophomore women’s activities
honorary, to be held this Wednes-
day at 3:30 o’clock in the Rainbow
Room of Webster Hall. The affair
will be the ﬁrst co-sponsored by the
two organizations in many years.

“We are going to have an orches-
tra,” said Levison. “We’re going to
be different. The orchestra is not
famous, has fulﬁlled no great con-
tracts in prominent’ hotels in Boston,
and, insofar as we know, has nothing
else in mind after we have paid them
off.

“But it's really going to be a swell
affair. The Cwens will be there. And
 the Druids. More later.”

‘Red ’ Nichols’ Pennies
AnnualJuniorProm Next Friday

 

Committee Selects Big-Time
‘Name Band’ For Dance
At Downtown Hotel

 

Yielding to requests of campus
prom-goers, the Junior Prom coni-
inittee, headed by Thyrsa Agness
Amos,’ C, signed Red Nichols and
his Pennies to play for the “top”
event on the Winter social calendar
January 15.

Nichols’ orchestra, now 17 in num-
ber, including three male vocalists
and one girl singer, has grown rap-
idly. Several years ago “Red” had
a ﬁve-man band which he called
“ ‘Red’ Nichols and His Five Pen-
nies.” This was later increased to
11 men, and the present group of 17
has been playing together for sev-
eral years.

“The committee was fortunate,”
said Miss Amos, “in being able to
obtain a band with the reputation
and ability of ‘Red’ Nichols. He is
the highest-priced band contracted
for a University dance in recent
years.”

“Dance Must Go Over”

Scheduled for the Hotel William
Penn’s 17th ﬂoor, dance tickets will
sell at $4 per couple.

Theodore W. Biddle, assistant to
the dean of men, had this to say of
the committee’s band selection: “It
is a great band. Frankly, the idea
is an experiment. This committee
will have the largest budget that I've
ever seen for a dance before, but I
am convinced that the sentiment on
campus is for a big ‘name’ band.
This dance must go over, and if it
doesn’t, it will probably mean the
end of expensive bands for class
dances.”

Last of the big '‘name’’ bands to
appear at a University dance was that
of Ferde Grofe, which furnished the
rhythms for the Soph Hop some two
years back. Previous to that time,
that is before the depression, na-
tionally-known orchestras frequently
furnished the music for campus
dancers.

Another Campus Chairman
Signs Band For Dance:
‘The Broken Record’

By Mel Rogow

It’s a woman’s privilege to change
her mind! And Thyrsa Agness
Amos, C38. chairman of the Junior
Prom, has changed hers plenty in
the past two weeks. But that is all
in a day’s work for the usual Uni-
versity dance chairman. _

Once again, it wasn’t exactly ‘the
chairman’s fault that she changed her
mind. It seems there were several
orchestra bookers who had something
to do with it.

You see, Thyrsa wanted a band for
the Junior Prom. She wanted a really
big-name band, too, since, she says,
the campus demanded one. And so.
feelers were sent out from the dean
of men’s office in an effort to get a
band for Thyrsa. By telephone, by
telegram and even by personal visits
to Cleveland the prom committee let
it be known that they wanted a
“top” band for the dance.

Wires Hummed

The pay-off came on Monday, Jan-
uary 4, when the dean of men’s oiiice
received a telegram offering the com-
mittee Paul Whiteman at $1,250.
They said, “Whiteman will be avail-
able only one possible night, Jan-
uary 7.” That gave the committee
exactly three days to print and sell
tickets, to advertise, to publicize, to
make minor arrangements and above
all, to explain a $5 price to the
student body. Oh, yes . . .

The committee had decided to go
through with its plans despite the
limited time, but then it was found
that Whiteman “missed the train.”

Then ‘the wires really began to
hum. The scene shifted to Cleve-
land and “deﬁnite arrangements”
were made with the Blue Barron or-
chestra. The next morning the com-
mittee received a telegram stating
that Barron was unavailable due to
a previously scheduled rehearsal.
Wires hummed more furiously. Then
the break came. “Red” Nichols was
available.

The end was in sight.
Nichols signed, deﬁnitely.
to be here January 15.

Return F r o m Successful
Rose Bowl Invasion
Carried By Radio

By Sam Williams

One week ago today the
Panther football team went to
town at the expense of Wash-
ington’s favored Huskies. Yes-
terday the Panther football team
came back to town from their 23-day
Rose Bowl trip to the Paciﬁc Coast.

Arriving at 1 o’clock in the after-
noon on their Special chartered
train, the Panthers, with coaches,
and others in the party received the
m o s t “bodacious”
welcoming recep-
tion of its kind in
Pittsburgh history.
Thousands jammed
the Union Station,
thousands clung to
walls and ramps
adjacent to the
station, and thous-
ands lined the
streets to watch
the returning vic-
torious Panthers.
It was truly a
great reception for a great team.

It was exactly 1 o’clock when the
big train pulled into Pittsburgh.
Immediately the Pitt gridders and
coaches were hurried to a pla'tform
for the welcoming ceremonies which
were broadcast by three local sta-
tions, and relayed over a national
hookup. The band played, the stu-
dents cheered, an-d short speeches
were made by Jock Sutherland,
coach of the Pitt team, Chancellor
John G. Bowman, Mayor Scully, Ex-
Mayor E. V. Babcock, Charles D.
Wettach, chairman of the Pitt
Alumni Council, and Chester Smith
and Jess Carver, sports writers, who
were introduced by Al Barr, C38,
chairman of the home coming.

Down Liberty S'treet, turning up
at Fifth Avenue, across Grant Street
and out the Boulevard of the Allies,
the parade tooted along out to the
Pitt campus. Led by the marching
band, 135 strong, the parade was
made up of a busfull of football
players (the rest had slipped away
in all the excitement at the station)
and 156 cars filled with rootin’,
tootin’ students.

The cars carried signs and were
decked out in blue and gold colors.
Some of the signs waved were:
“Jock For Senator,” “Local Boys
Make Good,” “Panthies From
Heaven,” and “Welcome Home,
Pitt.” Even the cloudy day and oc-
casional raindrops failed to dampen
the students’ spirits. They cheered,
blew horns, and grinned.

In his short speech, Coach Jock
Sutherland remarked that the return
trip back from the coast was much
shorter than his previous three trips
with other Rose Bowl bound Pitt
elevens. In concluding, he presented
a11 autographed football to former
Mayor Babcock” in appreciation of
his loyalty to the Pitt team.”

Prolessor Holds
‘Substitute’ Post
For l'lal_l__Ccntury

Dr. Stewart Takes Position
Of Absent ME Teacher
In 1884 At WUP

 

The distinction of holding a “sub-
stitute” teaching job for more than
half a century belongs to Dr. Thomas
Reid Stewart, professor emeritus of
mechanical engineering at the Uni-
versity.

A year after his graduation from
the Western University of Pennsyl-
vania in 1884, Dr. Stewart was asked
to substitute for a few weeks as an
instructor in mechanical engineering
in the absence of the regular profes-
sor. Dr. Stewart “substituted” until
1.933, when he retired.

Dr. Stewart first gave vent to his
mechanical genius as a youth in a
sled-riding contest at his home in
Parnassus, Pa. The contest was to
see who could slide the farthest on
his “home-made” sled.

Using his ingenuity, Dr. Stewart
discovered in one of his father’s
books that the co-eflicient of friction
of iron was much less than that of
wood. So the youthful engineer
“borrowed” the iron hoops from his
mother’s washtubs, built sled run-
ners, and won the contest by an
eighth of a mile. ‘

Because of Dr. Stewart’s ability in
mathematics, Professor Samuel P.
Langley, inventor of the airplane and
director of the University's observa-
tory, employed him to solve many
of his research problems. Dr. Stew-
art recalls that one of these, involv-
ing the light properties of the sun,
had 144 possible solutions. Dr.
Stewart covered one wall of his
study with paper to ﬁgure on. There
were 12 equations with 12 unknowns,
and it took six weeks to get the ﬁrst
answer.

Williams to Speak
At Inquiry Forum

Curtis A. Williams, member of
Governor Earle’s commission for the
reorganization of welfare adminis-
tration in Pennsylvania, will speak at
Inquiry Forum Monday at 12:30
o’clock in Room 107, Alumni Hall.
His subject will be “Reorganization
of Relief Machinery.”

Mr. Williams, together with more
than a score of other prominent
Pennsylvanians, worked out and sub-
mitted last month to the Governor a
plan embracing the results of more
than a year's study on the welfare
problems in Pennsylvania. The report
included plans for the elimination of
overlappings and inefliciences in the
administration of the state's relief
and welfare agencies, through the
establishment of a new State Depart-
ment of Welfare. ‘

3 Babe In The Woodisl  

, Oi" COURSE it’s rather late to write about the coni-

ing of the New Year. The bells have long ceased
ringing and the ”horns have long since stopped tooting,
and most of us are settled again in our accustomed ways.
And probably, by this time, the rosy-checked little fel-
.low who greeted us from the front covers of dozens of.
inowspapers and magazines is sitting forlorn and shiver-
ing on some brownstone stoop—unless a kind old lady,
like the ones in the comic strips, has covered him with
a batlimat . . . orahorseblanket. _

It wasn’t quite fair to bring him into this place, for
Altamira. ." _ ' _ V.
ifwe thought seriously about it, we would easily_see’_
that it’s not the proper environment for a trim bright
youngster like 1937. The wages of sin in this modern
world "hang heavy upon us, despite our denials. And
widespread social unrest disturbs our dreams, even if
the king againireigns in Buckingham Palace. Besides
we even had to bring the New Year babe into the World.
sans swaddling clothes. 1 '

This little fellow is not so dumb. He m‘ust"realize that
the primeval slime-still oozes from our ears though we
would contradict him. He certainlyvdoes know that we
are, not a whole lot farther on the road toward civilized
living.-,~t_h,an ourdim-witted forbears who drew pictures
of bisonon the cave walls'at_Altamira. And he knows,

{if he reads the daily papers, that W-estern European
Civilization, as it ’is pleasantly called sometimes, totters
on the. edge of avoid not far from that same cave at
Altamira. ' 1

Most of what hesees mustappear as a welter of ill-
considered words, of indefensible actions, of ceaseless
change and flow with little order or meaning. At the
moment Democracy wobbles like a drunken sailor at a
soiree, fog-brained and a little uncertain. It seems to
fail because it lacks the courage to persevere in its task,
or because it lacks the basic intelligence to preserve
itself in an unprecedented crisis. All over the world,
governments, like aipack of hounds in the courtyard,
snap and howl at each other, endlessly.

The present-day Arts are less certain of themselves
than Democracy. Music, the most abstract of them, winds
itself up in_ mathematical symbols and hurls inchoate
atonalities at the unequipped listener. Literature suffers
from the torturousness of the Thomas Wolfes and the
proletarian smugness of the Dos Passos.

Yet, after all, it is the social situation that calls these
uncertainties into being. In a placid age the earth spins
contentedly on its orbit, and those who live then are
no't troubled by phantasmagoria shifting on a blood-red
background. But today nearly every maladjustment ap-
pears to have raised its unlovely head. Would that we
could dismiss these things that bother us by exclaiming
that “the world is out of joint!” - .

Yes we have given the little fellow the dirty end of
the deal, or so it appears now. But maybe this is a chance
fmood of pessimism and may not be borne out by the

acts.

It is comforting to think so.

Satire 1 '

E HAVE HAD so many questions in regard. to the
purpose of the “Welcome! . . . And. Oh, Yes, Get-
ting an Education” front page editorial in the Wednes-

. hibits in the Fine Arts Library in .
works by representative American artists that, although‘

THE PITT NE.-W5

day edition that the following announcement must, neces- O

sariiy. be made.

To all physical educationists in the College, the
Schools of Business Administration, Mines, Engineering,
etc., we regretfully announce that satire, although it "is
not practiced by those who, with clubs swinging menac-
ingly, chase madly after a harmless ball,'.is a common
device used by people in despair who write to ﬁll big
holes in news columns. Then, too, sometimes people
write for their own pleasure as well as that of others.
which we must admit is only a harmless violation of
good newspaper judgment.

At any rate, let’s forget all about the football glories
that are the University's for a time, at least, and turn
to Accounting Fundamentals, English theme books, the
Fine Arts, Economics, Political Science, or to some of
the better teachers and writers for our inspiration.

Fine Tribute

T TOOK MANY years before student and faculty em_o-

tion alike, such as swept into the downtown district
and with it thousands of Pittsburghers, came to life at
the University. Every person who attended the arrival
of the successful football party of sixty will remember
yesterday as one of the finest ’-tributes ever accorded
any similar homecoming of any great team in the his-

, 'tory of intercollegiate athletics.

First, the ceremony in the outside waiting room of the
railroad station presented Mayor Cornelius D. Scully,
former mayor E. V. Babcock, Chancellor John G. Bow-
man, Coach Sutherland, and the football team to the
entire country via at least three of the local 1:3./(I10 sta-
tions, key outlets in national radio broadcasting. O_ut-
side this room, thousands more milled about attempting,
to get in on the ceremonies. '

The parade which followed boasted one hundred and
ﬁfty automobiles, _ _,
team and the marching band. The thousands lining the
streets hoped for more than a passing glimpse of the
gridmen themselves. However, the _trip evidently had
provided Dr. Sutherland’s charges with enough exercise
and they chose to ride, rather than walk, in the parade.

Football itself, is not worthy of the show- But some- --

thing more fundamental than that broke down the
usual reserve and inhibitions that hold us in check.
Occasionally, it is a good idea to break down that
reserve, for by doing that we vary the pattern of __our
every day lines. And that is not bad for those of us,

Work ‘Not Enduring’.

St (I iit visiting the exhibit of reproductions _on ex-

" e S State Hall will find
they may not be particularly enduring, are provocatively
interesting. The paintings were selected by it J.\11'_Y_°1
qualiﬁed critics and artists, and presented by the Living
Art Society of New York.’ .- .

Thomas Donnelly, who studied under the o_ld“war-
horse of American painting. John Sloan, has his Val-
halla Bridge” entered in the present exhibition. His

technique resembles that of Goya in that it excels in’

the use of bold color combinations and spatial effe=cts.

»Most everyone will like this painting.

John Marin, one of the most publicized of modern
painters, has entered a landscape of “Deer Isle Islets,
Maine,” what this reviewer calls an “old ladies’ spe-
'cial.” It is the sort of thing that the elderly female art

connoisseur raves about on opening nights at exhibi-

tions because the painting has a “motive.” Picasso has

cashed in on this sort of thing very nicely by painting

hunks of nothing in general, sticking a nose on it, and
titling it, “Women in Repose.” — .. .,

However, it is very difficult to judge these types of
painting. Wagner's operas and incidental music were
booed off the concert stage whenever they were pre-_
sented; Zalo suffered decided disapproval of his social-
istic trends during his lifetime, and Coach Sutherland’s
power plays were underestimated by West coa_st_sport
writers not so long ago. -

Marin does possess decided -technique and "shows-

originality in this landscape. Perhaps the typical atti-
tude assumed toward it can be summed up in the remark
of a young painter, who, when asked his opinion of it,

remarked that it was very .ﬁne, but he would like to‘

know just what is was meant to represcnt.. .

There are many other good works in the exhibition.
Louis Eilshemius’ landscape of “West Point” possesses
merit in many points, exclu-sive of the fact that it was
completed in a half hour’s time. Georgia O’l{ee'fe,
whose paintings ﬁnd a proﬁtable haven in the hands of
collectors. has one of her sensitive studies of “Autumn
Leaves” entered, and Emil Ganso-, an artist from the
Harz Mountains of Germany, where goodvcanary birds
and painters are raised, is represented by his “Village
Church,” painted in gouache. X 

Lucile Blanch’s “Outdoor Circus” presents all of the
observation and interest found, in the crinkly pages. of
the little _books ofﬂhours that the Flemish masters inthe
pre-Renaissance period were sofond of illustrating.
Artist Blanch has missed nothing: the gawking country
bunipkins in for a big holiday, the gesticulating villain
of the melodrama, acrobats, and the. usual assortment
of clowns, but she has managed to weld everything in-
to a compact whole that speaks well for her ability.

The show, free to students and faculty members, will
continue for two'weeks. Prints may be secured from
the ﬁne arts office in State Hall.

Dr. Karn Explains Psychology Tests

Study Described As True Science With Practical Value

Based upon the activities and workings of the

mind, psychology has become a true science.

tations of human behavior. .

Asked to point out the workings of the department, Dr.

Harry W. Karn, instructor in psychology said;

. Through the’ use
of experiment, psychology is fast gaining power in its interpre-

box.

Dr. Karn mentioned two tests
based on suggestion and suggesti-
bility. The ﬁrst makes use of the
Whipple warmth tester. The appa-
ratus consists of a heating coil and
light connected to the coil and to a
separate switch. The instructor, turn-
ing the heat on- in the coil, tells the
subject to announce “now” when he
feels heat in the coil, and also in-
forms him that “when the heat is on,
the light will burn.” The subject is
tested several times, his reaction time
being noted.

The instructor does not inform the
subject that the light may be on when
the heat is not on. The subject is

human

unusual. Our laboratory work is noth-

in addition to several buses for the .

was connected with the object in his ,

« . After the subjects have been given

ing more than experimentation and
testing of whatever hypotheses we
may advance. Do you think the stu-
dent .body would be interested?”

Psychology is not charlatanism, nor
is it the mystic artifice of magicians
and faklrs. It is practical and is be-
coming more practical every day. The
lie detector, proposed and invented by
psychology, is gaining ground and has
been found to be of distinct value.

“There are two types of lie detect-
ors used in the study of criminology,”
Dr. Karn stated. “One type, the re-
action time experiment, is rather re-
liable, but is not as well known as the
mechanical lie detector.”

The lie detector mentioned by Dr.
Karn is based upon the law of re--
sponse to stimulus. The subjects to
be tested are given boxes ﬁlled with
miscellaneous articles, and are asked
to examine them for a minute; or two.
The examiner and the class‘ do not
know which box the subject inspected.

.;.p... on-9. .. ._. ..,__-- .-

sufficient time to examine the box,
they are brought before the class.
The instructor then presents stimu-
lus words, words that bear a rela-
tionship to the articles in the various
boxes. For example, if one of the
boxes contained a‘ copy of Gregg’s
“Practical Anatomy," the instructor
might present the stimulus words
“practical anatomy.”

When the stimulus has been given,
the subject is requested to say the
ﬁrst word that comes to his mind. In
the case of the above example, the
subject might ‘ say, = “embryology,”
which would not mean that he had
seen the box withvthe “Anatomy”
volume. But if he said “Gregg,” it
would be certain that he had.

A further test to ﬁnd whether the
subject is telling the truth, is to

watch the reaction time between the‘_
presentation of the stimulus word

andtthe response. This is based on
the hypothesis that the subject would
consciously search for an unnatural
response word, if the stimulus word

to see if the suggestion of heat by the
light’-‘alone will arouse the response.

Dr. ‘Karn illustrated the test on
verbal suggestion. The subject is
blindfolded. A sheet of smoked kymo-
graph paper is attached to a mortar
board cap, and a stylus is set in a
standard above the paper. The in-
structor tells the subject: “You are
swaying forward. You cannot stop
yourself. You are swaying forward.
imagine yourself on the edge of a
high cliff. Try to picture the situation
as vividly as possible."

The result of the experiment, that
is, the subject's response to the stimu-
lus, is recorded on the smoked paper.
“Often the subject will sway back-
wards,” Dr. Karn asserted, “in order
to offset the influence of the sugges-
tion.”

These experiments are based on
theories already widely accepted by
noted psychologists. “The results are
logical enough,” Dr. Karn main-
tained. “However it does require ex-
periment to test the theory.”

‘THE GAY DESPERjADll” 

HEPITTN

 

 For Bates Debaters

By R‘uIh’Horovitz
While ordinary mortals who attend
the University of Pittsburgh heave
sighs for the,Christmas vacation that
is now forever put away in mothballs,
the Bates College women’s debating

team calmly goes on and on vacation-
ing with the Pitt campus as just one
more stop on a 1900-mile trip. ,
Today the Bates girls are trying
to ﬁgure out “just what is economic-
internationalism” for an Ohio State
debating team; yesterday they were
worrying about the government
ownership of public utilities; on
Wednesday when they debated the
Pitt women at Heinz House it -was
minimum‘ wages that bothered, them
They keep several debating questions
on hand to work on in odd moments,
it seems, and pull just one out of the
bag wherever they go, “like spare
tires,” as Grace Jack, blonde junior
member of the team, explained.

Small Enrollment

“It seems queer,” remarked Har-
riet Durkee, her senior. teammate, “to
visit schools like this where some of

. the students never heard of a profes~

sor because he teaches in a different
department. At Bates all the students
know everybody on the campus; you

 

seldom meet a strange face any-
where.”

But despite its enrollment of only

61] studentsthe Bates debaters are
known from here to- Kalamazoo ap-
parently,’ "The Bates newspaper is a
college debating coach’s ideal, with
almost nothing but debating news in-
cluded. '

Dehnted Here Wednesday

In their debate with the University
women on Wednesday, the Bates wom-
en upheld the affirmative side of the
question: “Resolved, that Congress
should be~.em-powered to pass mini-
mum wage and maximum hour legis-
lation.” They pointed out that mini-
mum wage laws passed’ thus far by
the states and the national govern-
ment have been declared unconstitu-
tional by the Supreme Court and
therefore advocated a constitutional
amendment to take care of the situ-
ation. Minimum legislation, they
pointed out, would prevent the un-
organized worker from being ex-
ploited by the “chiselling” employer.

The University team claimed that
guarantees of collective bargaining
would benefit labor more than posi-
tive wage regulation by the govern-
ment. . . .. .
