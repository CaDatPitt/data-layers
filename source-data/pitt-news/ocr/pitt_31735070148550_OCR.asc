Council to stop nighttime me

Brendan Owens

Staﬁ” Writer

The parking meter enforcement
hours might roll back to their
previous hour of 6 p.m., depend-
ing on the outcome of a ﬁnal City
Council vote next week.

A preliminary vote yesterday
passed 8-1 to suspend the extend-
ed enforcement hours approved

in June for Oakland, Shadyside,

the North Shore, South Side,
Downtown, the Strip District and
Squirrel Hill. The ﬁnal vote will
be on Tuesday, and if passed, will
keep the suspension until Jan. 1,
2012. '

Pittsburgh expanded parking
meter hours and increased rates
this summer in neighborhoods
throughout the city, including
Oakland. The changes, which
took effect June 1, are part of
Pittsburgh’s pension bailout plan,

meant to prevent a state takeover
ofthe fund. 1
City Council enacted a ﬁve-
year series of rate schedules that
extended the hours of parking
meters around Oakland by four
hours. However, City Council
voted Wednesday to roll back the
enforcement times. .
Council members cited public
outcry and lack of understanding
on why the city increased prices
and enforcement hours as their
reasons to push back enforcement
from 10 p.m. to the original time
of 6 p.m. V ,.
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said he
supports City Council’sldecision
to cut back hours but is still con-

cerned with its plan to increase -

rates and enforcement hours as
a way to save the city’s pension
fund from state takeover. '
“The real issue is what does
that action do to the pension fund

and the potential takeover of our
pension fund, so if we can ﬁgure
out a way to avert state takeover

« and control the pension fund and

rollback enforcement hours to 6
p.m., I would be a supporter of
that,” Ravenstahl said over the
weekend.

The plan increased rates from
70 cents, 50 cents and 50 cents
to $1.50, $1.00 and 75 cents, re-
spectively, throughout Oakland’s

‘ districts. The rates will not change
. regardless of if the vote passes
City Council’s plan will also .

replace some of the old meters
around the city with multispace
meters capable of accepting cred-
it cards similar to those around
Schenley Plaza. The job has al-
ready been bid on, and the rev-
enues are in place to have these
installed sometime in the fall,
according tojohn Fournier, a
spokesman for councilwoman and

ter parking

Parking Authority board member
Natalia Rudiak.

City Council voted Dec. 31 to
raise revenue for the city’s pen-
sion fund by increasing meter
rates and expanding enforce-
ment hours without the support
of Ravenstahl and the Parking
Authority. V

The mayor’s plan, which was
to privatize city parking and lease
out the meter system to_]P Morgan
Chase 8: Co., was rejected by City
Council in December. His 50-year
plan included a $452 million lease
of parking garages and meters to
the private investors.

The city does not have the au-
thority to raise local municipal
service taxes, so solutions for the
pension fund centered around
parking. Any tax increase would
have to be approved by the state
legislature.

Republican Allegheny County Executive candi-
date D. Raja, a Pitt alumnus, came to Soldiers &
Sailors last night to talk to those from around
the University of Pittsburgh area.

Raja, who said he was on campus because
Pitt gave him atscholarship when he went to
school, added that he wanted students from
Qgkland campuses to come out and become
involved in political events. Supporters and in-
terested people came to listen and participate in
an hour-long discussion with the County Execu-
tive hopeﬁil. He took the time to listen to voters’
concerns about Allegheny County and answer
any quesﬁons they raised about the region dur-
ing the public town hall meeting ’

“We nied to do somethingdifferentwiththis
campaign,” Raja, a Pitt alumnus, said. “Most
people don’t do events in Oakland.”

He said one of his main goals as County Ex-
ecutive would be to get Pittsburgh’s graduating

“I am running because I came from India
and Allegheny County gave me a chance to be

kids right now.” .

Raja opened the town hall event by present-
ingabout75 audience members with three ques-
tions: “What do you like aboutAllegheny county?
What don’t you like about Allegheny county?
And what would you change?”

Members of the audience shouted things
they enjoyed about the county, such as the rich
culture, the great history and the great sports
teams. ’ V

But not everythingwas positive. Responses
included cuts to the Port Authority system, the
outsourcing of jobs and the lack of a manufactur-
ing base for college graduates. ,

Raja noted that one way to combat these is-
sues is the utilization of Marcellus Shale.

Because ofhis business background, Rajasaid
he “understands the public and the private.”

“I don’t think he is a born politician,” Gosai
said. “He is a businessman.” S ,

Raja’s political literature in the mail.

“Mailings are sketchy,” Swan said. “When you
go to vote it is important to be educated. Some-
times it’s almost impossible to know who these

Health has seven aspects

Healthy U < 1

More than 20 booths sat in the William
Pitt Union lawn Wednesday afternoon, dis-
tributing information about the seven areas
of wellness that the Healthy U campaign
focuses on: physical, spiritual, emotional,
social, intellectual, environmental and oc-
cupational. ’

Director of Student Health Services Mar-
ian Vanek said that all seven areas of wellness
are interconnected.

“If every aspect of wellness is worked on,
one can be more successful in school and
relationships,” she said.

Vanek said students must work on each
aspect of wellness to maintain overall health.
For example, being physically healthy but
neglecting intellectual wellness would not
be beneﬁcial, she said. The'Healthy U Fair

. allowed students to become aware of differ-

ent ways to take care of themselves in all the
dimensions of wellness.

Representatives from student organiza-
tions, including Various ﬁtnessclubs, Hil-
lel Jewish University Center of Pittsburgh,
Rainbow Alliance, and representatives from
the Stress Free Zone. Some of the programs
they talked about included yoga, zumba ﬁt-
ness, religious rituals and meditation tech-
niques. '

Sodexo also gave away pamphlets listing
healthy food options on campus for students

with meal plans.

Each booth had different educational
games that aimed to raise awareness in an
entertaining manner for students. True—false
quizzes and number-guessing games educat-
ed participants on statistics concerning sex,
drugs, necessary vaccines, medication abuse,
intramural sports and mental health.

Vivienne Tuckwaite, co-president of Ae-
tive Minds, a group that works with Pitt’s
“Talk About It” depression campaign, said
many students come to college with undiag-
nosed mental_health disorders. Her booth
had information about what students should
do if they have a mental health disorder and
where they can go on campus to seek help.

“We want students to be able to’ reach out
if they need help,” Tuckwaite said. “Our goal
is to help people get_help and get rid of the
stigma surrounding mental disorders.”

Some booths focused solely on physical
health and were concerned with body and
weight issues. There was a booth that mea-
sured blood pressure and Body Mass Index
to give students an idea of the state of their
current physical health. .

A lot of students took the time at the fair to
» I . ﬁnd out how much their weight had changed

since coming to college. By ﬁnding out their
BMI, students were given an idea of how to
conduct their diets or workout routines.
Another booth educated students on the
effects of smoking and drinking. It had a
display of a healthy lung and a lungseverely
affected by cigarette smoke, along with a

_ jar of tar that ‘showed what cigarettes "put

into people’s bodies. Students who visited
this table could play beer pong or do a dizzy
Walk while wearing goggles that simulate
inebriation. '

Students said they found the fair to be
helpful and educational. Many were inspired
to take note of the seven areas of wellness
and stay on top of their health.

Student Alex Chiang, who was ﬁlling out
a raffle ticket for a prize, said the fair was
very informative.

“I am going to make an effort to be health-
ier. I found out a lot of new information — I
didn’t know hookah was just as bad as ciga-
rettes,” Chiang said. I

Pitt offers classes on new OCC program

Gideon Bradshaw
‘ For The Pitt News

Pitt is holding a number of classes to inupduce
studentsto the revised Outside, the Classroom
Curriculum. 1

The Division of Student Affairs has made a
number of signiﬁcant changes to the Outside the
Classroom Curriculum programthis year, which

arebeingoutlinedforstudentsinocc101classes ‘

throughout September and October.

Pitt OCC coordinator Scott Hoflinan held
the ﬁrst 45-minute class on Tuesday, introduc-
ing about 15 students to the changes in the OCC
curriculum.

The Division of StudentAﬁ'airshiredHofﬁnan
as director of OCC one month ago. He oversees
the structure and assessment of the curriculum
and evaluates the program’s implementation
based on students’ needs. Hoffman, who previ-
ously worked in a large public school district in
California, alsoserves a liaison between various
campus entities to administer the program and

. expand the 

Pitt created the OCC-in the fall of 2008 as a
way for students to keep track of activities they
participate in on campus so that they can have a

transcript outlining their achievements to show  »

after graduation.

Over the summer, students and administra-
tors worked to revamp the program. St11dent
Government Board memberjames Landreneau

 

led the OCC Student Advisory Committee, which
was composed of 12 students and one supervisor,
Residence Life director Shawn Brooks. Together,
the goal was to make the program more “legiti—
mate,” Landreneau said last month.

Students must fulﬁll core requirements in
each ofthe 10 goal areas, in additionto numerous

‘elective tasks that students can complete before

ﬁnishing each goal area.

The most signiﬁcant of these changes was
that the new curriculum will require students to
complete fewer, more speciﬁc requirements.

About the old program, Hoffman said, “I’ve
had students joke that they get OCC credit just
for wearing seat bel .” g .

Hoﬂ'mansaidthatPitt originallyimplemented
the program hopingstudents woulduseitto create
awell-rounded college experience. The updated
program allows students to better demonstrate
qualities such as leadership, initiative, commu-
nication skills and other traits that would make
them more competitive candidates for graduate
schools and prospective employers.

Examples of events at which students may
receive credit include Yogurt and Yoga under
the category “Sense of Self” and the beneﬁt per-
formance Violin for Vasculitis for the categories
“Appreciation of the Arts” and “Global and Cul-
turalAwareness.” A

Upon completion, students will also be eli-
gible to join the OCC Honorary Society, another
addition to the new program Members of the

society will be eligible for exclusive beneﬁts, in-
cluding dinner with Vice Provost and Dean of
Students Kathy Humphrey and audiences with
visitingdignitaries. Theﬁrstinduction ceremony
for members willtakeplace in late October; Lan-
dreneau said.

Pearl Eni, a sophomore in the pre-med’pro-
gram who attended OCC events last year, said
she was more enthusiastic about the program
following the meeting Tuesday.

‘Tm actuallythinkingaboutjoiningthe Hon-
orary Society,” she said after the meeting.

Mayor plans  

to work with  

Council

Meters 4 1

The mayor said privatizing the meters
is off the table.

“That issue has been vetted thoroughly
and council sent a message that they didn’t
want to do that, and while I don’t agree with
that — it’s part of the reason we are having
the problems we are now —— that issue is
over, and we’ll deal with the situation as is
now, and we need to ﬁnd a way to fund our
pension,” Ravenstahl said.

Since the city owns the meters, the Park-
ing Authority was required to increase the
rates and expand the hours as City Council
dictated. But because of a previous agree-
ment, the Authority gets to keep most of
the meter revenue and pays the city an an-
nual subsidy.

Ravenstahl said he will keep working
with City Council to ﬁx the problem.

“It’s not ideal in the ﬁrst place to increase
the enforcement hours or the rates, but we
did so because we had a pension problem,
and we’re trying to solve it. And so if there
is a way to avoid it, we want to be supportive
of that, and we will work with council to try
and ﬁgure it out.” I

EDITORIAL

Develop your
own moral code

Whetherwe realize it or not, our daily
lives are rife with small moral dilem-
mas: to cheat or not to cheat; to pirate
or not to pirate. Unfortunately, ac-
cording to some pundits, we’re more
ill-equipped to address these issues
than ever before.

This past Monday, New York
Times columnist David Brooks
brought to his readers’ attention
“Lost in Transition,” a new book
that casts our generation’s moral
sensibility, or lack thereof, in a par-
ticularly damning light. In 2008,
author Christian Smith and his
team of Notre Dame researchers
interviewed 230 young adults ages
18 to 23 from across America, ask-
ing them pointed questions about
“moral dilemmas and the meaning
of life.” Their answers, according to
Brooks, were enough to make any
intelligent ethicist cringe.

Rather than providinga sensible
analysis of these topics, the inter-
viewees responded with “anything
goes” nonchalance — what Brooks
deﬁnes as “moral individualism” and
“nonjudgmentalism.” As one subject
put it: “I mean, I guess what makes
something right is how I feel about
it. But different people feel different
ways, so I couldn’t speak on behalf
of anyone else as to what’s right and
wrong.”

Unsurprisingly, Brooks believes
he’s identiﬁed the source of this
phenomenon. “Morals,” he quotes
Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor
as arguing, “have become separated
from moral sources” — that is, the
institutions that provide ethical
frameworks.

It’s true, of course, that we’ve
become divorced from the founda-
tions that used to guide our beliefs.
But ultimately, who can blame us?
The Catholic Church — perhaps the
foremost source of moral guidance in
America — continues to undermine
its status through sex-abuse cover-

ups. The U.S. government, which also

 

functions as a moral arbiter, further
tarnished its reputation with a string
of ﬁascos, including the disclosure of
Valerie Plame’s identity and the spin
doctoring of the Iraq War. In addi-
tion, due to the Internet, more people
know of this misbehavior than ever
before. And then there’s the media
— an institution that over the past
several years has become synony-
mous with partisan, know—nothing
pundits, vapid aggregator sites and
celebrity-centered “breaking news,”
not to mention a few debacles of its
own (see the Duke lacrosse frenzy,
the Killian documents).

Given this degradation of insti-
tutional legitimacy, it’s no wonder
young people withhold the judg-
ments they might have voiced in
earlier decades, when they still oper-
ated under established principles.We
simply can’t trust ethical authorities
anymore.

Ratherthanbemoaning our mor-
ally adrift condition, however, we
believe this is a fantastic opportunity
for young adults to think critically
and openly about what constitutes
right and wrong, rather than being
spoon—fed opinions from the afore-
mentioned organizations. In other
words, question every prevailingbe-
lief and leave no taboo unscrutinized.
Develop your own standards.

Of course, we’re not advocating
that young people take ethical di-
lemmas lightly, as many of the re-
spondents in “Lost in Transition”
did. Rather, we’d prefer that young
adults fashion moral codes for them-
selves — codes that don’t rely on pre-
established values (some of which,
like homosexuality’s immorality,
are antiquated). If that entails ac-
ceptance of previously frowned-upon
behaviors, then so be it.

But then again, why listen to us?
Don’t let The Pitt News dictate your
beliefs — that, ultimately, is up to

you.  '

  

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

Making the most of a first-
clas Oakland wnter

  
    

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

Now that we’re three weeks into
the fall semester, it’s time to start
thinking about the next big thing:
Winter. Yes, before you can say
Jack Robinson, jack Frost will be
nipping at your nose. Are you pre-
pared to survive the Storm of the
Century of the Year?

But maybe “survival” is the
wrong word — it’s more appro-
priate for the back of your free
“Arrival Survival” T-shirt than a
column about Pittsburgh’s most-
underrated season. No, as far as
winter goes, you need to think
along the lines of “thrive-al,” be-
cause we’re here to tell you that this
will be the yuletide season when
you beat the odds,'kick the ‘crud
out of the evens, get acquainted
with the Roman numerals and start
romancing those wild and crazy
imaginary numbers.

As should be done for any piece
of serious academic writing, let’s
start with a bunch of facts selected
more-or-less at random. Among
large U.S. cities, according to the
Western Regional Climate-Center,

Vaughn Wallace I Staff Photographer

Pittsburgh ranks a mere sixth in
terms of rainy or snowy days per
year, with 152 — three fewer than
our hated Rust Belt rival Cleveland,
which comes in a staggering third
on the same list. Goodness, just
imagine that! Those poor saps at

v Case Western Reserve are suffering

through three extra days of sleet
and snow — days that we here at
the University of Pittsburgh can
spend sunning ourselves in those
cute little two-pieces we bought
on sale at H8zM. And don’t even
get us started on how bad life is in
Buffalo: the unfortunate denizens
of that heck—hole are staring down
166 precipitation-ﬁlled days with-
out even theexploitsof a dashing
gridiron hero like “Big” Ben Roeth-
lisberger or undeserving Madden
2011 cover model Peyton “Over-
rated” Hillis to ease their pain.
Now that you know how great
you’ve got it, it’s time to devise a
fail-safe plan for having the best
winter not just in the history of
winters, but in the history of forev-
er. The place to kick things off is in
your room, because that’s going to
serve as your “home base” during
this long, unforgiving ordeal. To

get the party started, you’ll want I

to have a bunch of those $5-pizza-
pie joints on speed—dial, a comfy
hoodie and a pair of sweats that
you won’t be‘ changing out of for
the next 152 days or so. In addition
to these essentials, secure at least
two of the major console gaming
systems as well as every single
installment of “Call of Duty,” and
numerous tubs of hot cocoa (or
chocolate whey protein, if you’re
“hardgaining”).

V Once you’ve acquired the neces-
sary supplies, it’s time to hunker
down like there’s no tomorrow
— and there won’t be, because
you’re going to sleep straight
through it. In fact, you’re going to
sleep through at least two entire
days, thereby transforming that
unbearable seven-day week into a
much more tolerable ﬁve-day ex-
ercise in taking it easy. As soon as
you’ve commenced this awesome
new way of living, text your “BFF”
to brag to him or her about how
sweet it is:

See how j ealous that “BFF” is?
There’s no doubt that he or she
would try to weather the storm
like you, but it’s now too late. In
fact, there’s a very good chance
that your “BFF” probably got a ﬂu
shot and is thus unlikely to have a
fantastic excuse like this one for
missing weeks or even months of

coursework:

Hey I’m real sick and someone I

is about to go in for surgery and

during whenever this class is, Fri-
day I think but possibly Thursday.

One of them.
thanks a lot,
urstudent

Those suits at Pitt might pride S

themselves on never declaring a
snow day this year, but the joke’s
on them — with afoolproof excuse
like that, you can enjoy as many
snow days as you want!

Yep, these next five or six
months look like they’re going

to be pretty, pretty cake for you.
You’re “just chilling” in a place
that’s less wet and more football-
hero-ﬁlled than Buffalo or Cleve-

$35—$1s4

Grade: A

Until Oct. 2, Pittsburgh will play host to

 dancing munchkins and ﬂying monkeys

as the touring cast of “Wicked” brings its
whimsical performance to the Benedum
Center. ~

The Tony and Grammy Award—winning'i L
musical, based on the novel of the same

name by Gregory Maguire, presents the
behind—the-scenes story of the classic
“The Wizard of Oz.” The musical details
the relationship between Elphaba, the

' Wicked Witch of the West, and Glinda,

the Good Witch. Before the hunt for a
heart, courage and a brain, the two young

witches developed a friendship.

The many parallels and references
to the “The Wizard of Oz” explain each
event from an alternate perspective and
ensure consistency. For example, at one

ity between the witches, both wicked and
good. In the end, both are characters
with depth who cannot be categorized
so easily. . ‘

ence, the element that sets “Wicked”
apart from “The Wizard of O2” is the
music by Stephen Schwartz. While ev-
ery character contributes their share of
musical talent, Glinda (Lisa Livesay) and
Elphaba (Anne Brummel) share many a

Glinda, Elphaba complements in ‘Wicked’

0 duet, including popular songs “Defying

Gravity” and “For Good.”

Both Livesay and Brummel expertly
portray their characters — Livesay of-
fers random shrieks of excitement and
each song of hers includes much bobbing
and bubbliness, while Brummel makes
many sarcastic statements between her
displays of courage. The two play off each
other well with friendly banter and mo-
ments of bonding. Near the beginning
of.their friendship, the two engage in
anawkward.dance—o~ff that turns into a
moment of understanding between the
witches, a situation that represents the
humorous, endearing theme of the mu-

’ _In addition to the extravagance of
the costumes, which changeiwith every
scene, the stage of the Benedum has been
Oz—ified. Itioffers elements like a red-
eyed, metal dragon that watches from
above and backdrops ranging from an
inviting sunset to the glitzy, green land’
of Oz‘. Special effects "include smoke, ﬂy-
ingimonkeys and a very green-skinned
Elphaba that make Pittsburgh feel a little
more magical. .

Claddagh Irish Pub

407 Cinema Drive
’ 412-3 81-4800
Grade: B+

Claddagh Irish Pub was in desperate need of a
makeover. Catering mostly to local rugby and

‘ Gaelic football players and wanderers tired of
the Cheesecake Factory wait, the pub wanted
to improve its image. ’

It is tucked away behind a Forever 21 and
looks positively humble in comparison to the
mammoth establishment across thestreet,
the Cheesecake Factory. Claddagh’s dark pub
exterior is such a contrast to the bright sur-
rounding storefronts that on first glance, you
almost miss it. V

But there’s something charming about
Claddagh’s relative anonymity — it’s the type
of place you simply happen upon. Claddagh’s
management hopes that with its updated and
streamlined menu and new attractions, they
will be able to draw in the local university
crowds by touting the bar as an authentic Irish
pub smack—dab in the middle of Pittsburgh.

Regarding the edibility of the fare at Cladd- .

agh —— well, it’s pub food. That’s not to say it
isn’t good, but the menu‘ consists mainlyof
greasy entrees that go well with a pint —— with a
few simple salads thrown in for good measure.

And as much as Claddagh promotes itself as an
authentic Irish pub, its menu is a fusion of Irish

and American recipes. - 9
Authentic Irish food tends to be heavy and

‘ ﬁlling without a lot of taste. By giving a bit of

an Irish ﬂair to some familiar American foods
—— and vice Versa'— Claddagh has made avery
smart move. And nothing displays this as well
asthe appetizers, which are probably the most
interesting part of the menu. There are crab
cakes stuffed with potatoes, spinach and arti-
choke dip on top of a hearty bread, meatballs

I dipped in ballymaloe relish and — my personal

favorite — Yuengling—battered shrimp tossed
in a sweet chili sauce. '

The entrees were, again, slightly American-
ized versions of Irish food. But it works. The
food isn’t quite as heavy as usual pub fare, and
small tweaks in the traditional Irish recipes
mean that you don’t necessarily have to sac-
riﬁce taste. Probably the most popular and
most highly recommended by the staff were the
slow—cooked short ribs, which diners gobbled
up happily.

The second staff recommendationwas the
burger. While the burger and fries themselves
were nothing new, itwas the ballymaloe relish
that really made the dish. Slathered generously
over the burger and then with more heaped on
the side for dipping, ballymaloe relish is sweet
and tangy, with hints of tomatoes, sultanas,
onions and various spices — detectable, but not
overpowering. It’s a sweet alternative to ketchup
and is almost more of a tomato chutney, which

Dozen cupcakes more moist

sweetness of the icing almost distracts from the
richness of the porous cake. Together, the deca-
dence of one cupcake from Dozen Bake Shop is
enough to act as a ﬁ.1ll slice of cake — exactly
what any cupcake lover wants.

As of now, cupcakes are still $2.50 each and
$25 for a dozen — a bit pricey?— although all
of the bakery’s prices could still change with the
recent transition into new ownership.

And, of course, cupcakes are only part of the
Dozen menu. Morning pastries include a vari-
ety of quiches, cinnamon rolls, scones, Danish
pastries, muffins and banana bread. The savory
scones —-which include tomato, onion, basil and
mozzarella— have a subtlytasty, buttery ﬂavor,
and are moist and soft inside their. crispy shell.

MOVIE REVIEW

 

‘Dolphin Tale’ a heartwarming, beautiful movie,

Swarna Sunkara
Stajf Writer

“Dolphin Tale”

Directed by Charles Martin Smith
Starring: Winter, Nathan Gamble, Mor-
gan Freeman

Grade: A-

Life isn’t always the party we hope for, but as
Amelia Earhart once said, “What do dreams
know of boundaries?”

Despite a painfully slow beginning, “Dol-
phin Tale” is a breath of fresh air in the
midst of cliched screenplays. Based on a true
story, the plot revolves around a rescued
dolphin, but offers a contemporary twist —
a prosthetic tail for a tailless dolphin:

1The Clearwater Marine Hospital rescued
a" dolphin named Winter after her tail was
taken off by a rudder. When a storm causes
damage to the hospital, they’re forced to
move and must work to ﬁnd someone to
make a prosthetic tail for Winter and the
resources to do it with the help of two chil-
dren, Sawyer and his friend Hazel.

Nathan Gamble does an excellent job of
playing the reserved, guarded 11-year-old
Sawyer. His reclusive character is in stark
contrast to both his overly talkative friend

Hazel and the incredibly friendly dolphin
Winter, who playsherself in the movie. And
she is indeed a treat for the eyes: Her tricks
and acts were well— choreographed and ﬂaw-
lessly performed.

Sawyer and Winter’s relationship is ex-
cruciatingly dragged out in melodramatic
scenes that fail to impress. But the movie
starts to pick up speed when a storm devas-
tates the town and the tailless dolphin’s only
chance of survival is a prosthetic tail.

Breathtaking cinematography paired
with a simple location create a picturesque
setting for “Dolphin Tale,” especially in the
aquarium of the Clearwater‘ Marine Hospital
and the town of Clearwater, Fla.. Beautiful

and vivid moments are captured in the ﬁlm, .

like the bridge Sawyer bikes across every

day, which overlooks a strikingly gorgeous .

expanse of water and forest-like greenery.

The plot really begins to take off when
Dr. McCarthy (Morgan Freeman) attempts
to design a prosthetic tail for Winter and
Sawyer and Hazel manage to persuade Dr.
Clay Haskett (Harry Connickjr.) to use pub-
lic support to save the dolphin. The two
11—year—olds organize bake sales, carnivals
and ﬁnally a show by the star herself. This
results in a feel—good inspirational con-

ALBUM REVIEW

MH the Verb album -

unlikely to be ‘Cult Classic’

Larissa Gula

Staff Writer
Cult Classic
MH the Verb
Classic Cult Music
Grade: C+

Rocks Like: Kid C'udi,_]ay-Z

When artists release new CDs,they havea
few choices: They can continue with their

V old style, change their tune, or ﬁnd a way to

combine the two and make a recognizable,
fresh sound. Pitt graduate Marcus Harris-,
a.k.a. MHthe Verb, faced this "same .deci—
sion when writing his ﬁrst solo album to
showcase his talents.

In the past, MH was known for his abil-
ity to combine live instrumentation with
electronic music. Many of his songs also
highlighted social justice issues, calling for
activism and a better world.

Whether he’s made more music along
those lines is debatable. His ﬁrst track,
“Winter In America,” does a good job in-
tegrating a historical speech — President
Franklin Roosevelt after Pearl Harbor -
with a typical hip-hop beat line. It’s soft at
ﬁrst, but grows in intensity as the song goes
on, until it drowns out Roosevelt’s words

and expands to include MH’s usual style of
hip-hop meets electro—pop.

This opening transitions into a- fast-
paced, fast-spoken song that proclaims in
the ﬁrst few lines that the reason there’s
“blood in the oceans” is because of human-
ity’s many ﬂaws. The song, in general, is a
crititiue of America. It obviously has a mes-
sage to deliver, but it doesn’t inspire action
so much as express MH’s-anger.

The song “More Time” goes, “What
would you do with a little more time / if
youlcould stop the clock / and watch the
world rewind?” It’s gentler in delivery, with

k a simple combination of drums and synthe-

sizer notes. It’s a good,‘ solid song for MH
that says one day people will get themselves
together.»

' But those two tracks are in stark contrast ‘

to other songs, many of which are ﬂirtatious
club rap songs, like “Lights Off.” And the
song “So Good” is a tribute to a girl who
things didn’t work out with — complete
with descriptive language about their sex
life. It’s hard to see how this ﬁts in with MH’s
usual routine and his history as a socially
conscious rapper.

There are certainly some good ideas in
an album that could have been much more
powerful and captivating. It simply does
not do MH justice. I

The general atmosphere of the restaurant
deﬁnitely draws its inspiration from classic
Irish pubs. Many pubs are designed to be social
places and as theyre usually small and stuffed
with tables, there is a community atmosphere
that fosters, conversation between groups.

Claddagh, however, is like most American

While not everything has changed in Cladd-
agh, the pub’s modiﬁcations have certainly
paid off. The implementation of College Night
on Thursday, Irish Night and a live band on
Wednesday and different drink specials every
night add variety. Televisions located around
the interior screen all differentitypes of sports
that are popular in Ireland, but harder to catch
here (rugby, soccer, etc.). All of these improve-

neighbors, Hofbrauhaus and Piper’s Pub. '

VOLLEYBALL

Errors highlight anthers loss

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

The Panthers needed just one more point,
and they had three chances to score.

Pitt, leadingthe match 2-1, had the Ohio Uni-
versity Bobcats (5-5) on the ropes with a 24-20
lead in the fourth set. Then Ohio pulled off the
unlikely as they earned six consecutive points
to bring the match to a 2-2 tie. Eventually, they
would take home the win after a 21-19 victory
in the ﬁfth and ﬁnal set at the Fitzgerald Field
House Tuesday night. L

Sophomore setter and defensive specialist
Maria Nicholas might have summed it up best.

“We letthem backinthe game and they took
over from there,” she said.

Errors dogged the 8-3 Panthers throughout
the close match. The Pitt team recorded 27 at-
tacking errors and 17 serving errors, whereas the
Bobcats committed 24 and eight, respectively.

Early in the match, the Panthers had the mo-
mentum. They won the ﬁrst set 26-24 as sopho-
more Monica Wignot led the team with eight
l<ills.The squad puttogetherthree serving aces to
earn the initial win. Head coach Toby Rens has
been pleased with Wignot’s play recently.

“Monica has been a huge offensive contribu-
torforthe team,” Rens said. “As asophomore, she
has shown leadership in the way she plays.”

Though the ﬁnal score indicated a close con-
test, the Panthers were able to hold the lead for
the entire ﬁrst set. .

“We were very aggressive early on in the
match,” Nicholas said. “The set got close, but we
never lost our focus or let Ohio take control.”

The second set was just as contested as the
ﬁrst, but this time the back-and-forth play ended
in the Bobcats’ favor as they evened the series
with a 25-23 win.

As junior middle blocker Jasmine Dittrich
sees it, the second set loss came as a result of the
Panthers losing their momentum.

“Ohio did not really show us anything that

wecouldn’thandle,”Dittrich,whoﬁnishedwith P

eight kills and ﬁve blocks, said. “We had the mo-
mentum from the ﬁrst set, but we did not capital-
ize on it and carry it over. Itwas deﬁnitely a case
of us beating ourselves.” Consistent with
Dittrich’s assessment, the Panthers committed
eight errors in the second set, including two
attack errors in the closing points.

V In the third set of the match, the Panthers
regained their poise in a 25-20 victory the
most lopsided result in the highly competitive
series. ,  . .

Don’t forget
about F
basebaﬂ
playoffs

Donnie Tasser

Hey everybody, remember baseball? You
know, America’s pastime‘? That beautiful
—- albeit snail-paced -— nostalgic competi-
tion that has been going on all summer? No?
Think beyond football, before the tackles and
carnage and turnovers. Okay, well anyway,
the season is still going on, and what should
be the most exciting part of the season is
being drowned out by early-season football.
So here is what you can expect to happen
through the playoffs and what you missed
over the past month while you were fantasy:
football scouting.
Big money wins again

1 Of the nine teams still in contention (and
still dreaming of a World Series victory) only
one —— the Arizona Diamondbacks — have a
payroll less than $85 million. The top three
— the New York Yankees, the Philadelphia
Phillies and the Boston Red Sox —— have
the three best overall records in the league.
Go ﬁgure. The Yankees bought their whole
lineup, whereas the Phillies bought their
whole rotation. This year’s playoffs will prove

not who reigns supreme, superior pitching‘

or explosive hitting, but which is a better
investment for the big boys of baseball.
Remember those uber-close division
standings?
We should have realized it would never

- have lasted. At thejuly 31 trade deadline, ﬁvet.

of the six divisions’ top two teams were sepa-
rated by three games or fewer. Now only one
division‘ has the second place team within
three’ games (American League West), and
in three divisions, the second place team is
over nine games out. Parity —- a keyword in
the NFL that Major League Baseball never”:
learned —— is once again absent, causing
every baseball city (save for the nine still
in contention) to forget that the season is
still going on.
Justin Verlander is a boss
The Tigers’ ﬂamethrowing right-handera

will become the ﬁrst starting pitcher to win

Verlander having historic
year, leading Detroit

Tasser< 15

MCT Campus

Justin Verlander has dominated the opposition this season, setting historic marks in
baseball as he chases the pitching Triple Crown.

for the Red Sox back in 1986. Verlander is
looking to win the Triple Crown of pitching
— leading the league in wins, earned run
average and strikeouts. Add to that the fact
that the W0 rkhorse has more starts, innings
pitched and the lowest whip in all of baseball.
He has led the Tigers to a 12.5—game lead in
the division and has virtually been unhittable
the second half of the season, riding a per-
sonal best 11—game win streak with an ERA
of 2.51 over that span. He has also pitched
a no-hitter for the second consecutive year
and is the ﬁrst player since Sandy Koufax in
1965 to throw a no-no and win at least 23
games in a season.

Remember how the Pirates were con-
tending?

Well, not anymore. The Buccos were the

toast of the city for most of the summer.
The management seemed-to care for the
ﬁrst time in my lifetime, and the team had
its ﬁrst capable manager since Jim Leyland
left in the mid—1990s. A talented — albeit
young — team, the Pirates showed ﬂashes
of brilliance, actually rose to the top of the
division, attracted a fan base, and actively
sought Major League-caliber players at the
trade deadline. But alas, the clock struck
midnight and the carriage turned back into a
pumpkin, and as injuries and inconsistencies
piled up, the Pirates started to look more
like the Buccos we know and love. Now on
the cusp of clinching their 19“‘—consecutive
losing season, a light can be seen at the end
of the tunnel. It might not be that close, but
at least it’s visible. 3

SOCCER

Marquette presents

challenges, Panthers ready

Jon Anzur
Staﬁ” Writer

~ The Pitt women’s soccer team created a

nonconference narrative rich in struggle
and defeat. But tonight, the Panthers will
begin a new chapter as they look for their

second win of the season in a tough game e

—-— the team’s Big East opener against na—“
tionally ranked Marquette.
A step up from the Panthers’ first

C seven games, [Marquette presents some
challenges. The Golden Eagles (7-1) are,

- ranked N 0. 8 in the coaches’ poll and have"

' won their last three..games. I

“Marquette is deﬁnitely going
to be one of the hardest games on our
schedule,” said senior goalkeeper Kristina
Rioux. “It’s a good test to see where we’re
at.” p ’ . . . ' '
The Panthers (1-5-2-) travel to Milwau-
kee with a three—game losing streak,,dur-
ing which they’ve been outscored 8-0. For
the season, Pitt averages a meager 0.62
goals per game while surrendering 2.50.

If they hope to change their fortunes, the,

Panthers need to start scoring. Marquette
has averaged 1.20 goals per game and only
surrendered 1.80.

“We need to ﬁnd a way to put the ball

' in the net,” said senior midﬁelder Katie
Ruhe. “I think once we get the offensive -

aspect down, we’ll be fine.”

The Panthers focused much of their
practice time this week on ﬁnishing shots.
Anemphasison offense will not only lead
to more goals, said Coach Sue-Moy Chin,
but it will also help prevent the other team
from scoring them.

“We’ve been working with our backs
on their sense of positioning and defend-
ingcrosses,” said Chin. “But we’re also
working on the attacking side, relieving
pressure [on the defense] by keeping pos-
session of the ball. We felt like wewere
_constantly defending [in the first few
games].” .

Coach Chin added that the Panthers
arerelatively young, and although her
team has progressed a bitslower than
she would’ve liked, the girls are moving
in the right direction. Ruhe echoed this
sentiment. '

“We have a young team, so we’ve had
to overcome some differences, which is
something we haven’t ever had to do,”
said Ruhe. “Our ﬁrst game, I thinklthere
were only four girlsout on the ﬁeld that
had ever played together before.”

Seven freshmen and ﬁve sophoinores

1 have seen action this year for th.e§Pan-

thers. _ V 
' Still, the team expects productionggfrom

I everyone on the field, and they’ll need it if

they hope to defeat Marquette. Last year,
the Golden Eagles beat Pitt with a score

of 2-1 before eventually advancing to the '

third round of the NCAA tournament. It’s
still early, but their hot starthas deﬁnitely
caught Pitt’s attention.

"‘Marquette’s having a great season so
far,” said Coach Chin. “They have a lot of
different threats in their attack. Their‘sys—
tem is very difficult to play against. But,
like any system, it has weaknesses, and

_we’ll try to exploit those weaknesses.”
*  ;j The Panthers will face two of the con-
T ference’s perennial powers in their next

couple of games. Marquette, led by reign-
ing Big East Offensive Player of the Week
Maegan Kelly, has outshot their opponents
151-45 this season. T_hey’ve accumulated
22 goals while giving up just ﬁve — equal
to Pitt’s total for the season-so far. On Sun-
day, the Panthers will host South Florida,
last year’s Big East runner—up.

“.‘Our conference is a lot tougher than

our out-of-conference schedule,”-said ' i

Rioux. “We-played Penn State [earlier
this year], which was our biggest test.

‘ That team resembles what we’re going to

play in our conference, and we did pretty
well in that game. So that actually gave us
hope for our conference schedule. But it’s
definitely going to get a lot tougher. That’s
why we’re working on getting everything
in sync for our game on Thursday.”

\ Aside from winning, Rioux said that
she hopes to see her team increase their
intensity, an aspect with which the Pan-
thers struggled during nonconference

~. games.

.“We played down to teams,” said Rioux.‘
“We need to keep the tempo going the
whole game.” ,

Getting a quick goal, winning “sol-50”
balls and going strong into tackles are
ways in which Rioux said hervteam can

dictate the ﬂow of the game.

The Panthers will look to forget

their early season strife and start the Big 1  ’
East season — which runs until the end I

of October —— with a win. Yet, in addition

‘,to leaving Milwaukee victorious, Coach , 

Chin said she expects her team to raise
their play to another level. W

“The girls always get excited with con-
ference play,” said Chin. “We just need to
execute better. If we start executing well,
then Ithink we’ll have a chance every
game we play.”

“I expect everyone to come out and
compete,” added Ruhe‘. “We’re not a bad
team. We need to prove to ourselves, and
to everyone else, that that’s true. That’s
what I’m hoping for this weekend.” I ‘

by the Bobcats stunned the Panthers, and they

’ were unable to recover.

“Anytime you let an opponent come back
and beat you, especially on your court, it takes
anemotional toll,” Nicholas said. I

During the ﬁfth set, the Bobcats
jumped-out to an early 9-5 lead, still feeling the
momentum from their previous come-from-
behind win. , ‘

“I think that the ﬁnish of the fourth
set was still fresh in our minds once the ﬁfth set
began,” Dittrieh said. “We let the negative emo-

, tions linger, and by the time we let go, it was too

late.”
