Senior Ball Loss
Amounts To $7 5

Corsages Distributed At Grand
March As Dance Favors

 

 

According to Howard Kleeb, BA,
chairman of the annual Senior Ball,
the affair Friday night at the Hotel
Schenley sustained a loss of approx-
imately $75. The ﬁnancial report of
the affair is far from complete, says
Kleeb, -but preliminary compilations
indicate that the loss will be no
greater and hardly any less.

Merle Jacobs’ NBC broadcasting
orchestra from the Hotel Hollenden
in Cleveland supplied the music for
dancing from 10 to 2 o’clock. The
traditional grand march began about
midnight, at which time corsages
were distributed as favors. Kleeb and
Miss Katherine Keown of Pittsburgh
were the march leaders.

ﬁnancially. it broke from tradition on
itwo counts: it was the ﬁrst Senior
‘Ball in recent years to be made into
.a summer formal, instead of a strict-
Ily formal affair; and, with tickets
priced at $3 per couple it was the
most inexpensive ball of recent rec-
ord.

Practically all women present wore
formal gowns, while the predominant
male dress was sports style.

The success of the Complete the
Cathedral drive, now being directed
among the public by administrative of-

friends of the University, would make
the tower the effective center of Uni-
versity life by next autumn, Dr. John
G, Bowman, Chancellor of the Uni-

versity, told a News reporter Mon-
day.

The reporter had followed Dr. Bow-
man through a day of interviews and

engagements, and found him still

working on the drive by telephone
from his State hall office. For the next
ten days the public drive is to con-
tinue at top speed.

“The ﬁrst report meeting of the
volunteers may not show great totals.”
DI‘. Bowman said, “But in a little
more than a week we shall know how
effective our appeal to the coinmunity
has been, If people in Pittsburgh care
as much for the Cathedral as our Uni-
versity faculty, we’ll have more money
than we know what to do with.”

Dr. Bowman praised the helpfulness

of student Hospitality committees and l and invite the world.”

of courtesy, their good sense, and
their good manners in meeting people
down there have won the University

the drive, work will commence at
once on the interiors. It is Dr. Bow-
niaii’s desire to make the beautiful
Commons room a setting for informal
student social life immediately.

A Notable Year

 

The following editorial was
written by John D. Paulus, retir-
ing editor, at the sU99€5tl°|1 °f
the editor.

Glancing over the events of the

past vear we ﬁnd numerous out-
standing events that make the

. school year 1933-34 a notable year

in the history of the University.
VVith the economic depression and
a huge building program keeping
students and administrative mem-
bers on edge throughout the year,
we note many activities which
will stand out in future.yea_rs as
the work of the University is re-
viewed.

To this observer, outstanding
among the notable events are the
resumption of work 011 the Cathe-
dral of Learning, the new Com-
plete the Cathedral campaign, and
the organization of the new Stu-
dent—Faculty association with its
governing body, the University
assembly. Among other highly-
important events may be listed
the reorganization of the "W0-

men’s Self Government associa-‘

tion and the increased effective-
ness of the University placement
bureau under J. C. Barton.

While we have made our quota
of mistakes and errors in judg-
ment duriiig the past year, we
feel that the year will compare
favorably in every respect with
other years in University history.
In the ﬁeld of publications, the
Owl for the ﬁrst time in many
years came out on time and in
much improved form; the Pan-
ther was highly successful; and
the Pitt News, in addition to
placing favorably in national com-
petition, had its most successful
ﬁnancial year.

Perhaps there are a few events
which we have omitted from the
following list. But these, in the
memory and opinion of the writer,
stand out as notable events of a

notable year:

1. Resuming work on the Cathedral
of Learning.

Beginning a new Complete the

Cathedral campaign.

Organization of the Student-Fac-

ulty association, a novel form of

student"-faculty government,

. Successful athletic teams in foot-
ball, basketball, swimming, track,
and golf.

. No losses on social ‘events with
exception of Senior Ball.

. Reorganization of WSGA.

. Merging of WAA and PEP.

. Appointment of Vincent Lanfear
as new dean of men.

. Withdrawal of Interfraternity

council recognition as a move to

reorganize the fraternity group.

Student-written successful Cap

and Gown show.

Work started on Heinz Chapel.

Announcement of plans for Foster

Memorial building,

Gifts of original manuscripts of

Ethelbert Nevin and Stephen Col-

lins Foster.

Deaths of R. B, Mellon and Benja-

min Thaw, trustees of the Univer-

sity.

Virtual completion of new Mellon

Institute building.

Honors bestowed upon members

of the University personnel among

which are the following:

Appointment of Dr. Silverman
as delegate to International
chemical gathering in Spain.

Appointment of Dean Thompson
to State Liquor Commission.

Election 0 f Dr. Gustave
Schramm to judge of juvenile
court.

Appointment of Mr, Walter
Rome as superintendent of
juvenile home.

Appointment of J. C. Barton as

director of the placement bureau

and subsequent increase in the
bureau’s effectiveness.

Decision to make freshman hand-

book the University handbook to

be given to all students.

The increase in the attendance

and prestige of Inquiry club.

The organization of a new Student

Discussion Forum.

Volume XXV, Number 58

Volume XXV of the Pitt News
is now material for research. The
issue today, Number 58, is the last
of the folio, 1933-1934. Hence-
forth it will only be available,
with its 57 forerunners, upon the
presentation of a properly signed
slip to the State hall librarian.
The. libra.ry reports that similar
folios from other years remain in
excellent preservation. Scholar-
ship has dealt tenderly with this
particular reference.

And yet it seems that research
should not entirely pass these
volumes by. The columns of Vol-
ume XXV contain two or three
thousand feet of printed stud that
has eluded the scissors and waste-
basket and hell box, not to men-
tion almost as much diverting
contemporary advertising. It
hardly seems possible that this
much could have been written a.nd
-printed by students without giv-
ing away American universities
aiid university students entirely.
These were the luncheons and
drives and festivals our time went
to, and those were the forums and
editorials and letters to the edi-
for. In the lazy middle of May,
it just seems that the social his-
torians and the sociologists and
social psychologists ought to be
interested.

It is a melancholy thought,
that some of us are about to go
out of print. There must be sev-
eral feet of “by—lines” in Volume
XXV, but most of them will be
collectors’ specimens by this time
next year. Even the most suc-
cessful young metropolitan re-
porters wait a year or two for a
regular, syndicated column; and
this year, the successful young
metropolitan reporters are hold-
ing up their hands to us—pa1ms
out.

Assuredly, not only the mem-
bers of the News staff think these
melancholy thoughts: the other
publications have their jumping-
off places, and all are more or less
used to manifestations of falling
leaves. On almost any publica-
tion day, 4 o’clock ﬁnds the day ’s
copy of the News swept from
under the Alumni hall benches,
the latest Owl tucked on the li-
brary shelf behind glass doors,
and the next Panther expected
momentarily. In this situation it
is proper for us all to join hands
while we chant together: “The
world will little note, nor long re-
member, what we say here; but
we can never forget what We did
here.”

 

Darrow Dares To Do

The Darrow Board’s report on the
harmful features of the National Re-
covery Administration may be taken
elther as the serious three-months
labor of a group of intelligent ob-
servers or as the ﬁnal publicity-get
ting blast of a once great criminal
lawyer, Labeled “inaccurate and
superﬁcial” by Richberg and Johnson,
leading lights of the NRA, the Board’s
50,000 word report is an important
document which advocates the social-
ization of industry for a planned sys-
tem of production. It is obviously
serious business with Darrow.

By the action of this Board, created
to give the little man in business a
voice, President Roosevelt is “put on
the spot.” It is necessary for him
now, in view of the facts presented,
either to take the Board’s recom-
mendations seriously and investigate
monopolistic practices or listen to
Generalissimo Johnson and abolish the
Board and burn its lengthy and in-
teresting report.

In most of its essential features the
NRA has been created to bring re-
covery back to the United States, But
only in ﬁve of the 443 code author-
ities is representation other than by
leaders of industry. Johnson and Har-
riman, leaders of the NRA, are both
industrialists. The obvious rise in
prices of raw materials is concrete in-
dication of NRA’s monopolistic ten-
dencies. Small business men who have
sought to organize into larger bodies
to effect better representation on their
boards, ﬁnd their associations led and
dictated to by the big men in their
ﬁelds. The American Automobile
Chamber of Commerce, the Iron and
Steel Institute and the American As-
sociation of Manufacturers are power-
ful factors in the NRA’s program.

In several places the Darrow re-
port is inconsistent, But its incon-
sistences may be overlooked in the
face of important facts it has un-
covered. The sounding note of the
entire report is its call for socializa-
tion of industry to abolish “wo1ﬁsh
competition.” -Whether the NRA can
effect this socialization is doubtful.
Another report on “How to Achieve
Socilization of Industry in the United
States,” from the pen of Mr. Darrow
would be greatly appreciated,

THE PITT NEWS

Effluvia

By Saul Weisberg

INCE THIS ISSUE OF THE News is the last of the year and also
marks a date about two weeks before the formal graduation cere-
mony, I suppose that it would be only natural for me to write a
farewell. At least, it is a general habit. for columnists to devote 'Lll€ll‘
last twenty inches of space to extended remarks about what they
have said in their previous columns, what they think their readers
should have learned, and other vague matters of that type.

It is even more common for
columnist to make his farewell a. gen-
eral discussion of what a farewell
should be, although the farewell it-
self never takes shape. The column-
ist usually spends two or three col-
umns as a build-up to the farewell,
so that, all in all, perhaps, sixty or
seventy inches of space is used for
this sort of mouthing.

It wasn’t quite as fortunate as the
ordinary columnist, for I was able to
sneak in only one" column before this
-one preparing for the last goodbye;
and the editor didn’t even like that,
although in consideration of my long
employment and grizzled hair, grown
gray in service, he let it pass through,

Farewells, in and of themselves,
are rather difficut of composition,
anyway; almost as much so as an in-
troductory column. And‘ in the case
of the latter, you always know that
You will have many more columns
to attempt to correct the impression
you have made, whereas in the case
of the former you have the unmistak-
able feeling that people will always
judge you -by that last column and not
by any of the earlier creations you
have turned out. Perhaps, that is
why columnists say nothing in their
last column; it is rather easy to have
people like you through the spouting
of balderdash and tosh, but not so
easy through laborious effort on a.
serious attempt to change the world.

Reform ls Pretty Thankless
ORRECTING THE existing eco-
nomic and political inequalities
and injustices is a thankless task,
anyway. Why so many people spend
their valuable time trying to remove
the weaknesses of our social struc-
ture frequently puzzles me. Very
few of them ever receive the plaudits
of the crowds. Hardly any of them
gain either money or power. Most of
them do not even become well-known
martyrs. I guess one reason can be
found in the psychological makeup of
the individual, although attributing
things to psychological ma.keups is a
rather ticklish matter, and will get

you into trouble sooner or later.

Of course, the real reason that we
ha.ve radicals and crusaders can be
discovered in the fact that we actu-
ally do live in world of wrongs and
mistakes, and one in which there are
a great many more underdogs than
top sergeants. But despite the pres-
ence of poverty and rottenness, it is
far more comfortable to ignore them
than to attempt to erase them. at
least, more comfortalble for those
who do not have to live in the pres-
ence of ﬁlth and dirt.

And since it is much less annoying
to overlook maladjustment rather
than to try to straighten it out, most
people, including columnists, usually
are only too ready to accept the
ch.a.nce to do the former. That is al-
so why columnists welcome the op-
portunity presented by the farewell
column in which they are expected
to do nothing except say bood—bye in
as clever and light a manner as pos-
sible. VVhy a farewell should be

light, I don’t know, except that thei

farewell of a columnist and his read-
ers is a rather inconsequential mat-
ter, possessing little signiﬁcance un-
less the columnist may soon ‘be seek-
ing a, job. ‘In the latter case, of
course, it is a serious affair for the
columnist, although he isn’t supposed
to let anyone know that. After all,
it would be shameful to worry his
readers about his future, especially
when his readers have so many wor-
ries of their own.

When we discuss worries, that im-
mediately brings up the fact that
very shortly a great number of stu-
dents are about to graduate. leaving
behind them very little in the way of
a heritage. Certainly, about the best
advice a senior can give other col-
lege students is to recommend doing

thv.-,‘v‘

what one pleases, although occasion-
aly a few words on how to avoid cer-
tain mistakes can come in handy,
even if no one will pay any attention 1'
to them, About the smartest thing
future college graduates can do is
probably to organize so that they can
attain certain objects through mass
action. Assuredly, the student ought
to make a. determined effort to pre-
vent a war, although prevention does
seem impossible. And just as assur-
edly, the student ought to organize to
take deﬁnite part in the economic
and political activities of the country.
This latter action, interference by the
student in political affairs, should
certainly be made, despite the at-
tempts of so many to restrain the
students to academic and recreational
functions.

Should Demand Consideration

T IS RATHER. peculiar that stu-

dents always look upon themselves
as having the right, if not the inclina-
tion, to be considered members of
society; whereas other persons’, not
students, always look upon the col-
lege boy and girl as human beings
somewhat apart from the crowd and
not old enough to _have a hand in the
shaping of our destinies. That no-
tion rests with other wicked ideas
that are prevalent and that ought to
be combated, for students are just as
much worthy participants in the ac-
tivity of society as the banker or the
industrialist, and deserve at least as
considerate a hearillg. But the stu-
dent can not and will not be given a
hearing until he makes himself heard
above the voices of all the other
groups that demand pork and beans.
And that perhaps should be the
duty and probaby will be the purpose
of the future students, to demand
consideration and to make himself
worthy of it.

1 notice that I am approaching the
end of this last column and I rather
resent it, since it -brings to mind
many things of which I would rather
not think. It also causes me to re-
member all the people to
whom I would like to wish luck. Only
one thing prevents such an open wish,
and that is the fact that it would be

Between You,
Me And The:
Lamp Post

r¢¢©¢O¢¢o¢Q9¢-17

F‘!-THE GODS HAVE a strange way
of answering the prayers of col-
umnists—at least this one, Last time,
you will remember, I bewailed the
fact that college columnists are
treated with so little consideration,
that while syndicate managers real-
ize the value of a columnist and send
him off to Miami in search of ma-
terial for his column, college editors
invite their columnists to go chase
themselves. Then I added, with a sigh,
that I had not even a lame terrier to
write about. That was where I made
my mistake.

Now when I made my supplication I
had no thought of having either of
my wishes granted, and certainly I
did not want a lame hound. A trip
for a hundred miles in any direction
would be welcomed, of course; but
the dog element was thrown in only
for effect though I never cease to
wonder at the quantity of words that
several columnists write about their
canine friends. It was, simply, thought-
lessness that led me to include the
supplication for a dog.

At any rate the supplication got
there and has been in part answered,
though I would that it were not so.
The darned mut! VVhen I ﬁrst met
him I did not notice that he limped
with his rear right leg, I only
scratched his dirty brown and white
head and tugged at his long, hound-
dog ears. He was not acquainted in
these parts, he told me, and asked to
walk along with me, I consented, and
by the time we reached my house
we were quite friendly. He didn’t
have to tell me that he was hungry,
for his ribs rippled under his dirty
coat as he limped along.

VVAS NOT SURE he would accept

but I asked him if he would care
to join me in a bowl of -bread and
milk. He accepted with much wag-
ging of the tail and a particularly
teary glance of his large, soulful eyes.
I didn’t mean to ask him to live here
permanently, since Mother and Lil,
the bla.ck cat, both object to hounds
of any sort. But he stayed that night
uninvited and slept on the back porch
on my last semester’s pants. In the
morning he was standing at the
screen, patiently wagging for his
breakfast.

“Now look, friend,” I told him,
after he ﬁnished eating, “after all
you can’t just stay on here forever
like this. Mother and Lil have feel-

probably just as smart for me to wish
myself luck, since I’ll probably need
it like everyone else. After all, this;
is, as the conservative tells us, a hard-
and cruel world, in which every one
must take care of himself. Rather
pitiful, that notion, since it would be so
much better for everyone concerned if
all the graduating seniors decided to
help each other, instead of themselves.
Then, perhaps, the graduates and the
other students might have something
to hope for, instead of something to
fear. And then, too, maybe life would
have a slightly sweeter taste and a.
somewhat more fragrant odor.

Joe Brown, Wales, Anna Held
Pose In Professor’s Display

 

By Ruth Cohen

A very, very funny picture of Joe
E. Brown at the age of 12, wearing
tights; a likeness of the Prince of
Vvales, with a quizzical, unprincelike
expression; and the hour glass ﬁgure
of the famous Anna Held, are only a
few of the pictures which ho-bnob,
side by side, on the wall of the State
hall basement office of James C, Reed,
professor of business law.

There are more than 600 pictures
in the collection, and they cover a
wall space at least eight feet square.
Many of them are pasted over two
and three others.

The collection began about 30
years ago, but its display on Mr.
Reed’s office wall began about six
years ago with a. calendar picture of
Galli-Curci. Since then Mr. Reed has
added and subtracted, pasted up and
torn down photographs.

Men and women from every walk
of life are represented, some of them
two or three times. Earl Sande,
jockey, is the sole member of his
profession to be there. Jim Corbett
and Honus. Wagner are among the
athletes, and a. group of famous foot-
ball coaches, features Dr. John Bain
Sutherland.

There are actresses whose costumes
trace the history of woman’s dress
from 1887 to the present time; there
is a picture of the once-famous Lizzie
Kelsey, who appeared in “The Black
Crook" in 1887. While a freshman at
the University of Illinois, the young
Mr, Reed went to see this show, in
which, it turned out, there appeared
a chorus of girls in tights, to the
deep shock of the audience, The only
woman present walked out, and the

young freshman, beginning to feel un-
comfortable, was; considering the
same procedure when he saw his
math “prof” three rows ahead, and
so decided to remain.

Authors are most numerous in the
collection, closely followed by movie
actresses. Every fpresident of the
United sates, members of the Su-
preme court, senators, judges, educa-
tors, preachers, kings, queens, inven-
tors, opera singers, radio stars, actors,
actresses, and a statistician, are also
included.

Perhaps one of the most interesting
features of the collection is the way
Mr. Reed has coupled pictures of a
person when he was young with more
recent photographs. There is John D.
Rockefeller at the age of 21, and at
the-age of 90. There is a. very hand-
some'Teddy Roosevelt as a college
youth, as a young man, and as presi-
dent, A picture of Polly Moran at the
age of 22 is almost unrecognizable
until you compare it with her present
like-ness. There is also a picture of
Lind-bergh wearing formal dinner
clothes.

At one time Mr, Reed offered $10
to anyone who could name all the
persons in the collection. but no one
has yet succeeded, other than the col-
lector himself. Everyoneis stumped
eventually by a picture of King Al-
phonso as a baby.»

A very sad Charlie Chaplin, holding
an equally sad little dog, looks down
upon James. Russell Lowell; Henrik
Ibsen walks beside S-lim Summerville;
Honus Wagner and King George are
rubbing shoulders; and Sylvia Sidney

ings about you, you know. And While
nothing more than “You’ll have to
get rid of that dog, Bill,’ has been
said, there doubtless will be much
trouble if you don’t soon move on.”

He agreed, I thought, with more
slow wagging, and followed me down
the back steps on three legs. “Vi-’e’ll
go up to the service station where I
met you, and you see if you can’t
ﬁnd some one else to eat with to-
night.” He said nothing and when we
got to where we ﬁrst had met I spied
Speed Jennings, whose motorcycle
isn’t running right either. He said
that he thought his carburetor needed
cleaning, and I suggested that per-
haps his spark plugs were fouled. And
so we discussed gaskets, cams and
oil consumption for some time, and‘ I
was half way home before I thought
of the dog. I looked around and he
wasn’t following me. I sighed with
relief, a relief that was short lived,
for when I got up on the back porch
there he was on my old pants. “I got
tired of listening to all that nonsense,”
he explained, “so I thought that you
wou1d_n’t mind If I just came back up
here and rested.” He yawned.

I know that he didn’t understand
what I said to him then because after
I was through he yawned and wagged
his tail. I-Ie’s out there yet, so if
any of you, dear readers, would like
to have one perfectly healthy, sane
hound with only a slight limp in his
right hind leg, you can have him.
Just call Penhurst 1273 and ask for
me. You can have the pants too.

Pitt News Mourns Seniors

As 8 Depart

For “Outside”

 

By Charles Byron Holstein
Soon possibly they may be punch-I
ing typewriters which really print
when the x key is hit; possibly, again,
they may not be, Regardless, six men
and two women no longer will grow
gray prematurely because all lay-.
outs aren’t in on time, or because
slightly dazed reporters just can’t get
that story out of such and such a dis-
gruntled department head. Six men
and two women will shortly stand
in line garbed in conventional cul-
tural costume and will receive very
important scrolls of sheepskin —— and
the Pitt News will be minus eight of
its best producers.

A few of these eight actually claim
they have jobs on the string; the
rest merely smirk and politely say,
“Oh yeah?” when queried by a News
reporter as to their future activities.

Six men and two women will be
very poignantly missed in the roar-
ing ofﬁce of the News a few months?
from now. And it might be a goodl
guess to surmise that six men and!
two women will poignantly miss the‘
roaring ofﬁce of that same News a
few months from now. They’ve spent
too much time in that ofﬁce in the
last few years to react otherwise.

Personalities

John D. Paulus, C, shoves a couple
of sticks of editorial matter into to-
day’s issue of the paper as his swan
song, after four lengthy years of serv-
ice—service in jobs including reporter,
feature writer, copy desk, news board
and editor-in—chief. And he’s got a
job pending——he’s that good a news-
papernian. A member of ODK, of in-
nuinerable committees, and a former
member of every University publica-
tion staff, John will be hard to forget
when he isn’t back next year cutting
out paper dolls of II Duce. It’s a.
known fact that JD has been more
successful in getting the paper out on]
time more regularly than any execu-
tive in recent years.

David Immerman, BA, is, it's true,
no longer Business Manager of our
semi-weekly, but he’ll remain in Pitts-
burgh in a. responsible job down town,
Dave, a Cleveland boy who made good
hereabouts, was Comptroller of the
News last year and previously worked
on the Owl and Panther on the Comp-
trolling staffs, Also an ODK member,
he’s been tooting in the band these
many years, and numerous committees
would have been lost without him.

Managing Editor Maxine Garrison,
C, came up heah last year from good
old ‘West Virginia and immediately
created such a furore on the copy desk
as a head writer of speed, accuracy
and imagination this year’s staff could
not possibly get under way without
her in the responsible position she's
held, And how she held it! Strong
men behind the “stones” of the print-
ei-’s composing room were over-
whelmed in the beginning of the year
to ﬁnd a slight young woman giving
orders—intelligently if there was any-
thing Max couldn’t get done at the
VVNU plant, no power on earth could
have accomplished it. Between in-
numerable hours spent behind her

News’ desk, she found time to grace
a few Pitt Players productions, read
themes for the English department,
preside over Xylon. women’s honorary
journalism fraternity, and maintain a
very cool and quite attractive appear-
ance regardless. She, too, may soon
be working. . .

It’s hard to separate Hy Cohen, BA,
Jack Sollinger, C, and Bob Badger, C.
'l‘hey’ve even adopted a. common let-
ter of application . and what :1
letter! Any prospective employer who
could keep a calm, straight face while
reading it should certainly apply for
all prizes in any “dead—pa.n” contests.
Hy follows his illustrious brothe-r’s
footsteps by conducting the Campus
Scout column during the two years
since the original Scout graduated.
At Commencement exercises they’ll
probably ﬁnd Hy in the “bull pen”
dashing off a few predictions as to
next year's football scores. (Yeh, Pitt
-over Duquesne by six touchdowns!)
Hy not only served the News for four
years (ﬁnishing as associate editor)
but found time to sports edit the Owl
twice, manage and ﬁght on the box-
ing team, and supply most of those
really funny cracks in Kronenwetter’s
Panther. Jack, Campus editor this
year, has felt a bit lost ever since
the graduation last year of his cronies,
Ray Riehl and How Teplitz, and the
News, consequently, has missed one
of the sweetest performances of “feet-
on-desk” copy reading extant, As
president of Sigma Delta Chi, pro-
fessional journalism fraternity, Jack’s
last year here has been an important
one on campus. Badger, some times
called “Saxy” (he’ll get me for this)
has been, alas, pining for Kentucky
ever since the NCPA convention. As
Sports editor, Bob has his red-headed
self in everything stirring athletically
and maintained a sprightly sports sec-
tion all year. \Vilinerding’s white hope
is going to be missed by a corps of
admiring sports scribblers next year.

And if one or two more of their let-
ters of application continue to escape
waste baskets, the above three should
soon be cattle-boating, or prospect-
ing, or running newspapers.

Nadezhda Iungerich, C, goes from
Pitt with the coveted Sigma Delta
Chi award for scholarship preemin-
ence among journalism majors. Sh_e
ends three years of service With this
issue, and her ﬁnely written features
and patient copy desk work will be
hard to replace. She has not informed
the News of any plans for her future
as yet,

“Effluvia” bids the News good bye
today when Saul Weisberg, C, its
‘creator, ha.s his ﬁnal column pub-
lished. A political science major, tak-
ing honors courses in this ﬁeld, Saul
has been well qualiﬁed to interpret
events of the day for News readers.
He gave the News exclusively three
years of his college career, and this
year kept in contact with the paper
with his regular column. During his
ﬁrst three years, he spent the better
parts of many sleepless nights at
breakneck working speed in the News
ofﬁce, VVhat he’ll do? Your guess

“Needles and pins, needles and plus!
you cut and you baste, and your‘
troubles begin.” This is the themeg
song this spring of almost a hundred‘
co-eds who are designing and making“
their own clothes. Sewing has ceased
to be a mere matter of following a
pattern; like the pictures on ﬂower
seeds. So this year the girls have
taken to creating their own ensembles
of hats and dresses and doing their
own designing

The movement toward originality
in college sewing was given a boost
by the recent “Young American De-
signers” contest held ammw college!
women. Pitt was represented by
Frances McLaughlin, C35,fashion com-
mentator of the Pitt Panther, who
was awarded honorable mention.

In the clothes she has made for
school wear, Miss McLaughlin, C35,
has shown the same individualism
that characterized her contest model.
A blue linen sports dress trimmedl
with white buttons and monog1'am,.

Panther Tennis

Enviable Record For Season.

 

By Joseph Barker
Up to the match with Duquesne uni-
versity yesterday the varsity tennis
team had compiled a ﬁne record of

nine victories and but one defeat, and
as the Panthers have defeated Du-
quesne and their other two remaining
opponents, Washington and Jefferson
and Grove City, in matches earlier in
the season, they stand a good chance
of winring all three of these matches.

Too much credit cannot be given
Nathan Ganger, who is captain of the
team and has played at the No. 1
position all year. G-anger has gone
through ten matches without losing a
singles match. He handed Block of
Penn State his first loss of the year,
and was the only Panther to win 
match against Navy when the Gobs
beat Pitt, 8 to 1, at Annapolis. He
saved the Blue and Gold from a com-
plete rout by outlasting McClung, the
Navy’s ace player, in a three set
match, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3. This incidental‘y
is the only set which Ganger has
lost to date, Against Grove City, the
ﬁrst Panther net foe of the year,
Gauger had to come from behin-:1 to
defeat Holstein in the iirst set. He
trailed three games to none, tlzen put
on a spurt to take the set, 6-3. In the
next set he was ahead all the way
and beat Holstein, 6-1. His play all
year has been an inspiration to his
team mates. Ganger and Joe Madden
have made an effective doubles team.
In ten matches they have dropped but
one decision, that to Mann and Kim-
mel of Navy, 6-2, 6-3.

Joe Madden has also played a good
game at No. 2 in singles. He won
every singles match except that with
Mann of the Navy, who handed Mad-
den a 6-3, 6-3 setback. He won most
of his matches in straight sets.

Another sterling performer was
James Slocum, who played a highly
capable No, 3 for the Blue and Gold.
He defaulted to Pearlstein of Car-
negie Tech and lost to Kimmel of
Navy, 6-1, 6-2, Except for the loss

meeting of the American Institute for
Mining Egineers, will appear in the

Mr_ George begins with the estab-

founded here at the University in
1912. This course offered major work
in petroleum geology and petroleum

Panthers Start
For lC4A Meet

Coach Olson Enters 10 Stars In
Philadelphia Carnival

 

The Pitt track team will leave to-
morrow for Philadelphia to compete
in the ICAA track meet Saturday. The
Pitt team up to date is undefeated,
having downed such teams as Temple,
Penn State, West Virginia and Notre
Dame. Coach Olson has picked a
team to send to the meet on Saturday
that in all probability will give plenty
of opposition in every field entered.
Fleming will run in the 100, 200 meter
races and broad jump. Jacobson will
run in the 100 and 200 meters. Bill
Keller, the Pitt captain, and one of
the best half-milers in the Tri-state
area, will run in the 400, 800 and 1,500
meters, Kiger, a member of the re-
lay team and a ﬁne runner, will enter
the 400 and 800 meters. Connelly,
who broke the half-mile record“ last
Saturday at the Notre Dame-Pitt
meet, will run in the 400 and 800
meters. Vvagenhouser will run the
1,500 and 3,000 meters, Guay will en-
ter the 110 and 200 meter hurdles.
Good is entered in the 110 meter
hurdles and broad jump. Bonavita will
put the shot and toss the hammer.
Gongloff will throw the javelin and
is entered in the hammer throw.

Certain marks will be set by of-
ﬁcials of the meet and those making
these marks will have the chance to
go on to C-.1lit‘ornia and the National
championships, -Coach Olson is ex-
pecting that several of his boys will
come through for the national affair.

The track team may have a meet
with Geneva college at Beaver Falls
on Decoration Day. There has been
no deﬁnite agreement made concern-
ing the meet, due to the fact that it
may interfere with the ﬁnal examina-
tions.

TUESDAY, EV."-‘\‘x’ E2, 1934

I The Campus Scout

Strike Up The Band!

I may be interrupted at any time ‘before fini.-=hing this . . . and I won't
be mad . . . after foul‘ Fears of sports reporting, one gets the don’t care
attitude . . . it might be fun to some people . . . but to me . . . well,

what's the use? . . you do get to meet quite a few people . . . and things
. and stuff . . . too much of the last named.

First of all . . . I‘d better give plenty of thanks to Frank Carver . . .
Uncle Frank . . . without his help, I'd have never passed through the or-
deal . . . or something . . . here comes Jack Sollinger now to interrupt
. . . and that horrible creature Between You, Me, and the Lamp Post . . .
personally, I’d want the Lamp Post between Me and You . . . and that
quiet red-headed female who always sneers at our entrance . . . to think of
leaving her charming presence . . .

There are really several ways to write such a column . . . I

picked the easiest . . . strange to say . . . I happened to have a

brother who held the job two years before me . . . so my ability

won me the job . . . some people didn’t like the copy in this year’s

column . . . the cheerleaders were especially anti-campus scout . . .

and who could blame them? . . they were sweet boys . . . and

wondered why I razzed them so much . . . well . . . I have an
action photo of the boys in action . . . and no two (2) are in the
same position . . . go ahead and sioux me.

Strange things ha.ppened this year . . . I met some ﬁne people . . .
for a change . . . and got to know some of the coaches quite well . . . in
addition to ﬁnding out just how certain affairs are run . . . after all . . .
there's certain things I’d like to live over . . . Jock Sutherland’s expres-
sion when the News printed that SIX TOUCHDOVVN PREDICTION . . .
and the Duquesne team’s reactions . . . and there was at least forty bucks
that picked the Panthers to win by 6 points . . . working in the press box
. especially between halves . . .
when the eats were passed around . . . it took a year to learn when to get
yours . . . a.nd Joe Dasher . . . oﬁicial announcer . . . but why waste
space?

One real pleasure in this year's work . . . and it was a real
pleasure . . . was getting to know Doc Carlson personally . . .
for three years, this column didn’t have much chance to get ac-
quainted with the “Good Doctor” . . . but oh what a change . . .
if any one knows a better man in this crowd . . . he won’t be be-
lieved . . . so there . . . or something . . . anyone who has had
the pleasure of meeting Dr. Carlson wiil back this statement . . .
hats off to the number one man on the Pitt coaching staff, DOCTOR
H. CLIFFORD CARLSON.

The rest of the staff is no slouch . . .
best in the country on coaching talent . . .

Pitt can rank with the
JOCK SUTHERLAND

. . . great teams year after year . . a great sportsman . . . and a
gentleman . . . harumph . . . but . . . there's no denying the man’s
ability . . . given the talent available at our larger football fac-
tories . . . no team would top his . . . and that goes . . . even

though he didn’t agree with all that this space printed.

CARL OLSON . . . you do spell it with an “O” . bringing track
greatness back to Pitt . . . after years of barrenness . . . whatever that
is . . . there’s a man looking over my shoulder now . . . it’s that Sollinger
creature . . . telling me that I’m writing too much . . . but to get back to
Olson . . . keep your eye on Pitt in track . . . and keep your eye on the
gentleman from INDIANA . . . he didn't approve of the IOVVA tacked on
him once . . . take a crack at track . . . you’ll enjoy it . . . and Coach
Carl Olson . . . still with an “O.” '

Goody goody . . . Len lllarks . . . of the assembly marxes . . . and
not the Groucho . . . or ﬁnal . . . marxes . . . says this tripe is good . . .
Jimmy Nelson is watching me with a.n evil glint in his eye . . . and two
creatures from Avalon are waiting patiently to see their names in print . . .
I would, girls . . but no spikka ainglish.

PATRICK J. CORR . . . mustn’t forget. him . take a look at the
Pitt swimming records . . . and Pat Corr . . . connect the two . . . and
you have . . . Pitt swimming at its best.

Pro Bono Pubhcol

My public has been asked to voice an opinion on this year’s column . . .
here it is . . . unretouched . . . et cetera:

Jack Sollinger, Campus Editor:
your column. I like that picture of the lamp post.”

John D. Paulus, Something or Other: " ive him credit.
with it.”

Jack Tibby, Editor-In-Chief:
umn. We want to start ‘clean’ next year.”

Charley Ruch, Editor-In-Chief of the Panther:
with it was that it appeared once a week too often.”

Bee Kopsofsky, Copy Desk: “Only one thing wrong with it. The

“The only thing wrong

author.”
Lil Hahn, Nothing: “I refuse to be quoted. It wouldn’t look good in
print. $& .?*)&$.”

Jimmy Nelson, Sports Writer, etc.: “I thought that pinchhitter was
swell. Didn’t you?”

Bob Badger, Sports Editor:

Annabelle Fishl-(in, Reporter:
con.” (I'll sue for that.)

Wilbur D. Clark, columnist at Large: “I think it was just too ducky
for words. I liked especially the one that was all wet: it had a lot of ‘rain,

rain, rain. rain,’ in it."

“Oh well, why cause trouble now?”
“A pediculous imitation of a hegemoni-

The Cheerleaders: “Why you insignificant $%—” ’ (&—%$TY)
*’&-—”%1' §( )P ?:"@%;*).?KUY—-” $—-"”(. And furthermore, you,

@—%$fll‘(‘ 0&3’ (Oh boy, will the linotypers like this. And the
proof readers.)
The Campus Scout:—“l think that the News has been especially
fortunate this year in being singled out as the recipient of the Cam-
pus Scout. The value of such a column can not overestimated. It
is a distinct benefit to the student body at large. And to Dillinger,
too. He’s at large. And to some of the Pitt coeds who are pretty
large themselves.”
So ends a career, somewhat spotty, but with its brilliant spots. Relax
coaches. Relax . . . relax . . . relax . . relax . . . I’ll be seeing you
next year . . . and lots of luck. »

The Last Roundup

Probably nothing is so pleasurable or so sure a sign of senility as rem-
iniscence, and probably nothing can lead to sentimentality more easily. Tak-
ing the risk of being called senile and admitting an inborn sentimental streak
old man Sportorial has decided to bark back a little. Since the dot system
is particularly suitable to harking back (this is the harking back season you
know) and incidentally since it is the easiest to write, you, my legion of
followers (hello mom, heigh Charley) will be seeing spots in your eyes for
about humph more inches of this heah paper.

The ﬁrst big thrill . . . meeting the great Jock Sutherland for the
ﬁrst time . . . and hearing him coach the boys . . . displaying a letter
from director of athletic publicity Frank Carver and being admitted through
the closely guarded sacred portals of the practice ﬁeld . . . sitting in the
press box for the first time . . . seeing the writers whose columns I had
been reading . . . sitting on the anxious seat while VV&J held the Panthers
scoreless through 57 minutes of playing . . . seeing Pitt score and Wein-
stock kick a ﬁeld goal . . going to Morgantown with the band, a. really
fine group of fellows . . . that feeling as though the bottom had dropped
out of everything when the radio announcer gave the score, Minnesota 7,
Pitt 3 . . . the ballyhoo about Navy having the greatest team in its his-
tory . . . the feeling of compassion expressed by the staunchest Pitt rooters
as the gallant Annapolis boys went down before a perfectly clicking Panther
eleven . . . the ﬁne playing of the Pitt reserves in this game . . . Wein-
stock going over on a fake reverse for the touchdown against a hard ﬁghting
Duquesne team . . . that pass in the ﬁnal quarter from Shedlosky to Nick-
sick giving Pitt a victory over George Sauer and a good Nebraska team . . .
the ﬁnal game with Carnegie Tech.

Putting out a ten-page issue of the Pitt News for Dr. CaI‘1SOI1’g. basket-
ball clinic . . . six pages of sports . . . seeing the clinic a great success
. . . Pitt winning its first game over Georgetown . . . seeing the Panthers
lose a heart-breaking one-point game to Duquesne . . . sitting on the Duke
side of the Pavilion to get a different viewpoint . . . and getting it . . .
and almost drawing a trouncing from a big Duquesne rooter who couldn't
understand why I cheered when Wainio scored a bucket . . . the victory
over Notre Dame here . . . the ﬁne playing of the whole Panther team and
especially Cribbs over Krause . . . the repeat victory over the Irish . .
the complete demolishment of the Army here.

The victory of the riﬂe team over Carnegie Tech in a. dual meet . . .
its ﬁne showing at Cincinnati . . . seeing Wagenhouser run a beautiful
mile to take the Pitt indoor championships in 4:33 . . . hearing that the
Panther golfers had defea.ted West Virginia . . . hearing that Nate Ganger
had defeated the Navy captain in their rubber meeting of three years of
competition . . . seeing Tost cop the mile University handicaps . . . Detzel
winning the AMA championships . . . seeing Gianatti lose a ha.rd—fought
battle to Freddie Moore, Duquesne captain . . . hearing that mile relav
race at the Penn Relays when Keller fought off a Fordham man to win for
the Parrthe-rs in exceedingly fast time . . . hearing that Wagenhouser, Gong-
loff, and Keller had set new records down at Morgantown . . . and most
recently that beautiful half mile Connelly ran last Saturday to win the dual
meet with Notre Dame for Pitt.

In closing, I have only one bit of advice (my heritage) to hand down to
posterity. However it is so important that I would advise you people (especi-
ally you in the back row) to take this down in your notebooks:

French Groups To Present
-“Gay Soiree” June 4
For Cathedral Beneﬁt

 

 

June 4, at a “Gay Soiree,” an op-
portunity will be given to combine
the French students, French club,
members of the University staff and
their friends, to begin active partic-
ipation in the beneﬁt campaign for
the French room in the Cathedral. The
musical and dancing extravaganza
which the Foyer Francais of the In-
ternational Institute will present in
the Frick Training school auditorium,
Monday, June 4, at 8:15 o’clock, will
be a genuine Gay Soiree under the
(lirection of Mrs. Raoul G. Mayer,
president of the Foyer Francais, and
the only woman member on the com-

’ mittee for the French room.

Musical artists will be presented
from the Pittsburgh symphony.

Tickets for the benefit are now on
sale for 50 cents and may be obtained

professor and chairman of the depart-
ment of modern languages, in his of-
fice in 224 Alumni, and in 1309 Cathe-
dral, from Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitch-
ell, director of the Nationality rooms.

Pitk-in Club To Picnic

Pitkin club will draw its season
to a close with a picnic at South
Park on Monday, June 4. Each mem-
ber is providing a ﬁxed amount of
the food. An orchestra is being pro-
cured for dancing in the evening.
Any non-members who wish to attend
must communicate with Robert
Steele. adviser of the club, by calling
Schenley 4300.

Skipping Classes? Try
Faulty Metabolism
As An Excuse

They sprawl on park benches,
moon at singing birds and budding
flowers, walk heavily along the
streets smiling vaguely now and
then at passing acquaintances,
sit wearily on the benches in the
University halls, gaze at piles of
school books by their sides.
These spring fever-stricken indi-
viduals_

They blame the warm weather,
overwork at studies, or Cupid's
meanderings for their listless-
ness, but here is revealed the
physiological cause. As explained
by Dr. E. Alfred VVolf, associate
professor of zoology, the cold win-
ter weather stimulates a high
rate of metabolism_ With the ad-
vent of warm spring weather, in-
dividuals whose physical struc-
ture is not easily adjustable to
change unnecessarily continue
their rapid rate of building up
and tearing down tissue. This
one simple factor is the reason
for all the inertia, laziness, and
sluggish activity, It enables you,
however, when attempting to ex-
plain those cuts taken in April
and May, merely to tell the in-
structor you were forced to be
absent from classes because of
faulty metabolism. He will un-
derstand.

 

Sigma Kappa Phi

ALTER Palmer (left) and JAMES MCGREGOR, two stonemasons who
have worked on the stone for the Cathedral of Learning from the time
construction began, engaged in an unusual broadcast over KDKA recently

when they discussed the building from the standpoint of the workmen.

Pal-

mer and McGregor pronounced the Cathedral of Learning to be the most
beautiful building on which they have ever worked. =.

Interview Reveals Unusual Interest

Of Workman In Cathedral Erection

 

What workmen on the Cathedral
were thinking while they worked on
the tall building, and how they still
regard it, was told by the two stone-
masons in the picture above during
a recent radio talk. James McGregor,
a Scot with gray hair, and Walter
Palmer, a stocky Englishman, who
have worked together for forty years,
as stonemasons, in the old country
and in this country, are the work-
men who talked with the Aircaster
over VVCAE in a “Complete the Ca-
thedral” campaign broadcast.

VVhen asked if the workmen on
the Cathedral considered it “just an-
other building,” Palmer said, “Another
building! Say! Those men take more
pride_ in that building than you have
any idea of. They’re not only proud
of the work they’re putting into it,
mister, but they’re proud to feel
what it’s going to be like when its
ﬁnished They know it’s one of the
grandest buildings that was ever put

up.” ll-I,acGregor added, “These stone
setters and other craftemen working
on the building are skilled workmen,

most of ’em. They’re just as proud’

of their part in that building as the
workmen used to ;be when they were
building cathedrals in the old world.”

The conversation following these
remarks told of the 1,300 men em-
ployed by the CWA and RVVD and
the desire of the men to work rather
than be on relief. ,McGregor and Pal-
mer explained the work of stone-
masons, the dangers involved and the
skill required to become an expert
stone setter. —

Palmer set the stone for the ﬁrst
University building when the school
was moved to Oakland in 1908. He
also went to North Carolina to get
the columns for the building, State
hall, which were two 20-ton granite
blocks. Palmer also aided the Chan-
cellor in setting the cornerstone of
the Cathedral.
