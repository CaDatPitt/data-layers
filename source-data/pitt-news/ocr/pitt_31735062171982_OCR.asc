counted their experiences in the
Washington May Day Rally, and
recommended a sit-in at nearby

“When the lawn is used during

Soergel explained. “It just takes
a little common sense."

Blasts SA System

by BILL GORMLEY

Student Association Financial Director Bob Lederman has
resigned, expressing dissatisfaction with the Student Associa-
tion “system" and disappointment at what he considers the fail— '
ure of the four Commissioners to make the best of the situation.

Lederman. who took office early in February, told the Commis-
sioners April 29 he “canlno longer tolerate the lack of integrity
which I feel prevails in the operation of this form of government.“

Asked to interpret Lederman‘s resignation, Committees Commis— S
sioner Wade Lawson charged that Lederman had been "coopted by an.
administrator."

Social Commissioner Lenny Klavonic, denying a quote attributed
to him in Tuesday’s Pitt News, did say that “any student who works »
for an administrator is somewhat co-opted by the influence of the
man.” i

Lederman has accepted a job with administrator Bill’ Markus, di-
rector of Student Activities and advisor to the Student Association.

Lederman. who began working for Markus this week, was hired to _
do research on Activities Fees at various universities. Waiving mod-
esty. Lederman said he is “probably the most qualified student, from
a practical standpoint. for the job." Lederman. a senior economics
major. is Polaris business manager and former businessmanager of
the Pitt News. , it

Lederman’s resignation and the Commissioners’ counter-charges
coincide with a unanimous Social Commission vote urging that the Stu-
dent Association select its own advisor.

The Commissioners believe advisor Markus has intervened ex-
cessively and charge he is not sympathetic to "the goals we-are ex-‘
pounding." Lederman, noting that Student Association spending au-
thorizations require Markus’ signature, said, "I don‘t think the Com-
missioners should resent his knowing what their expenditures are."

Lederman pointed to a “terrible lack of communication" as a ma-
jor reason for his resignation. “I’ve been asked to keep tabs on the ?
Student Association budget and the Commissioners are spending.with-
out consulting me. "

Lederman further explained that he believes the Commissioners
have been making decisions hastily. c

‘Citing the decision to hike the Student Activities Fee, he said,
"An Activities, Fee hike is probably necessary. But when you are
going to take such a step, you should know how much money you
need, and you should divide that by the amount you will take in. I asked
a Commissioner how many invoices will be coming in, and he didn’t\
even know." ’

The Orientation and Mentor
Programs. formerly handled‘ by
the office of Special Programs.
have been transferred to the of-
fice of Student Activities.

The decision to move the
programs was made by l)an .\Ic-
Fadden. Executive Assistant Vice
Chancellor of Student .~\ffairs.

who explained the reasons be-
hind the move.
Special Programs, said Me-

Fadden, is an office primarily
designed to develop new projects
and programs. Presently, Konni-
lyn Feig, director, and her as-
sistant William Neff, are busy
preparing the new Institute for
Feminine Studies (the first pro-
gram of its kind in the United
States). In order to give them
more time to work on that pro-
ject, McFadden transferred the
Orientation and Mentor pro-
grams.

Neff agreed with McFadden‘s
nationale and added that Special
Programs had been additionally
burdened when Bea Lampiris
former director of Orientation
resigned for health reasons. It
was much easier to transfer the
programs to personnel acquaint-
ed with the programs. he said.
than to train new staff.

McFadden said the Activities
staff headed by Bill Markus.
were the logical people to take
over the two programs.

    

Ulick O'Connor, Irish poet,
criminal lawyer, and author of
the biography Brendan Behan,
will lecture in the Student Union
Ballroom, Tuesday, May IT at
7p.m.

The Comparative literature
Program at the University of
Pittsburgh will present Dr. Geof-
frey H. Hartman, professor of
English at Yale University in
the last of a series of lectures
on medieval literature, tonight,
at 8 p.m., in the Graduate School
of Public Health Auditorium.

It's 89 ways better than a Volkswagen.

The car you see before you has almost twice
as much trunk space as the Volkswagen Beetle.

It gives you a smoother ride and a shorter turn-
ing radius than the Beetle.

It even has a longer lasting, more powerful en-

gine than the Beetle.

All told, this car has 89 things you've never

seen inside the Beetle.

In fact, it's so superior to the Beetle, we couldn't
call it the'Beetle anymore.

So we gave this car, whose mild-mannered ex-
terior masks itstrue identity, a new name.

We call it SUPER BEETLE. ' -

“Because the two programs
were already well-established,
they really belong with Activi-
ties rather than with Special
Programs, which should devote
its time to developing new pro-
jects.”

“Also.“ McFadden said. "be-
cause there are fewer students
on campus during the third term.
they could devote more time to
the two programs.

“Actually. its a pooled respon-
sibility-a task force.” he added.
referring to the fact that both
Student Affairs and Special Pro-
grams personnel are on the fifth
floor of the Student Union.

.\'eff. who handled the finan-
cial end of Orientation agreed.

“Since we’re all here togeth-
er, we’ll all help,” he said “I’ll
work closely helping with fiscal
affairs.”

Markus explained how the two

programs will be directed
through his office.

"I'll be using a team ap-
proach." he said. “Tom Tack-

age. iassistant director of Stu-
dent Activities) will be team
captain. He will be assisted

by Rick Box student director of
Orientation and his commit-
tee.“ ‘

The Mentor program will be
handled by John Baginski, a stu-
dent who has worked with the
program for two years. He will
work in the Student Activities
office on a work-study basis.

Markus said that there will be
no big changes in either of the
two programs. "Most of the
planning has been done.“ he
said. "All we have to do is
see that the programs get put
into action.“ ’

Even bathing every day
can’t stop it.

Feminine odor starts inter-

water simply can’t reach the
area where the odor starts.

That’s the reason you need
Norforms® .- . . the second deodor-

effectively yet safely. In fact, gen-

No bath or shower can give
you Norforms’ protection. Get

Lederman also cited a Student
Association day-care proposal. ‘'1
think it's a good idea.“ he said.
"but a project like this must be
looked into. The mechanics must
be carefully considered." Leder-
man mentioned legal questions of
responsibility which were not re-
searched by the Commissioners.

“Even an Abe Lincoln would
have problems with the present
system,” Lederman admitted.
“But, for this reason, I think the
Commissioners should walk a lit-
tle slower and be sure of where
they‘re going.”

According to Lederman. the
current system lacks “checks"
and balances" and suffers from a
“conflict of interest." The Social
Commission. Lederman explain-
ed. is allocated funds. like. other
groups. but. unlike others. can
override -Allocations Committee

While conceding that no system
is perfect. Lederman mentioned
the University of Miami's Stu-

“ 3715 /14 act fitting Memorial Possible ’ ’

(Ed. Note: On the eve of May
4, candlelight memorial services
were held at Kent State Univer-
sity. About 3,000 students began
a silent vigil that was maintain-
ed throughout the night and next

‘day at the exact spots where the

four students tell one year ago.
by BOB BONN

I pulled my thin coat closer
to me in the windy, frosty cold
night and, with a serious ex-
pression, gazed past a few shoul-
ders into the candlelight.

A solemn student stood motion-
less, holding a lantern in the
dark. One year ago, 19 year-old
Bill Schroeder had died on
that place in the concrete park-
ing lot behind Taylor Hall.

Students stood in a large, rough
circle around him. Some held
candles. No one spoke. and most

looked downward and meditated.
each conducting his own mem-
orial service in his mind.

I turned and walked through
the crowd, alone. I stopped at
another group, where a girl was
holding a lantern at the spot
where Sandy Scheuer was killed.

Sandy, an honor student. was
between classes and was cross-
ing the parking lot. She hit the
concrete when the first shots
were fired. She never got up. A
National Guard bullet had gone
through her neck.

Tonight, students remembered
the dead. From three thousand
faces I saw no smiles. heard no
words. For the first time in three
days at Kent, I saw no appre-
hension of violence in the stu-
dent's eyes.

There was only. memory of a

 

terrible event. sorrow that four
had to die, and a genuine feel-
ing of remorse within everyone
present.

I turned and left the site. my
camera dangling unheeded at
my side. I sat alone and thought.

Later that night. a candlelight
procession was held around the"
large campus, and over 5.000
students marched in symbolic
rows of four. The service ended
with the playing of "Taps.“

The strong feelings of these
people will always stay in my
mind much more clearly than
any other May 1-4 activities.
Though the following days were
highlighted by exciting speak-
ers and by protest. the most fit-
ting memorial possible to Bill.
Jeff. Sandy. and Allison was
made that night.

This Year: Kent Protest Without Cause

by CAROLE COVAL

Imagine ,a hill, gently sloping up-
ward. With some trees. Almost like
Flagstaff-but with lots of people. Those
at the bottom of the hill are closely
packed, and sitting crosslegged lis-
tening to slang about how far out Wash-
ington was.

People at the top of the hill can still
hear the sound equipment. but they
stand like a human wall. They listen,
and hear too. Trying to filter out the
rhetoric from fact.

Ladies and gentlemen, you are wit-
nessing Kent State University’s front
lawn on a nice bright, blue-skyed May
4.

Not quite as big as the Memorial
service held on the Commons just an
hour ago, this gathering is entitled
“Open Kent.“ It is the official Rally of
the MayDay Coalition, unauthorized by
the Memorial Program. and therefore an
outright act of Civil Disobedience.

However, I’m afraid that this en-
thusiastic mass of “Open Kent! “rs didn’t
really accomplish much. except get a

lot of people together to pose for a
group picture.

According to House Bill 1219 in
the Ohio law books, they werent doing
altogether too much wrong. to be brand-
ed as brave revolutionaries of the new
order.

It seems that the law specifically
states that they would have had to ig-
nore a request from the “proper author-
ities” in order to be committing any
kind of crime.

The other half of that “section" in
the book says that you cant "enter upon
the land or buildings of a college or
university without permission.“

Since 99% of that group was Kent. the
only ones who were breaking the law-
were the speakers. and a few assorted
amounts of eager high school kids. "re-
volutionary
non card-carrying grads.

If they really thought they could
test HG No. 1219, the rally should
have been spread by word of mouth,
and a big surprise. But even then, the
administration probably wouldn't

something-or-elses" and .

  

>‘ 
PROTESTORS ON KENT LAWN

call out the National Guard,
or even throw some nasty -tear gas gren-
ades.

That campus with the nice lawn is
Kent State. and even the students are
realizing that it‘s partly their responsi-
bility to see everyone walks home safe.

Kent has some problems. Students
there would like a little more voice in

the trustees decisions. They call it
. Home Rule. Sound familiar?

Lots of people don't like the idea of
having ROTC on campus. either. But
what about the guys who want to take
ROTC. Hate to admit it. but when you
call for free speech. and'then demand

2

 

the limitation of someones actions.
there is a little bit of his freedom go-
ing down the drain.

Kent people don’t like war, either.
or the hypocritical practices of our
fearless leader. But then. if you are
truly against the war. and you don‘t
find it within your conscience to parti-
cipate. you will make personal sacri-
fices to avoid going.

Chanting a little Ho Chi Minh ditty
isn’t going to make this any more a
better place for your kids to grow up in
later on, than eating rotten peanuts
will create economic equality.

So often the say-ers of the world
unite to give themselves psychological
support. Not very often is it that the do-
ers go out and get something done
rather than undone.

Very happily. I watched a group of
people protest in a non-violent manner.
But in light of the closeness of a shad-
ow of tears that passed over Kent only
one year ago today. the leaders of the
rally were risking the lives of another
four or more.

For Quixotic Commissioners

Strong SA Advisor Needed

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

Student Association (SA) ad-
visor Bill Markus accepts his im-
pending dismissal from that po-
sition. without acrimony. “The
SA should have the opportunity
to name its own advisor." he
said.

Markus could hardly have said
more; neither of the SA Com-
missioners eager to replace him
has as yet informed Markus that
he is to be replaced or of their
reasons for instigating his ous-
ter.

This .quixotic, ill-considered
ploy is all too typical of the pre-
sent student governors and indi-
cates that a tough, discriminat-
ing advisor is still required to
augment the SA operation.

Social Commissioner Lenny
Klavonic and Committees Com-
missioner Wade Lawson are both
anxious to install an administra-
tive advisor of their own choice.

Klavonic maintains that Mark-
us is often too busy to take an
active role in SA plans. He adds
that Markus might well make
an excellent advisor had he the
time to devote to the job.

“We need an advisor that we

‘can work closely with 100 per

cent of the time,” explained Kla-
vonic. “The main problem is
one of accessibility.”

Markus. the Director of Stu-
dent Activities. is indeed a busy
man; Klavonics complaint here
may merit investigation.

But it seems clear that with-
out an administrative liaison who‘

One of America's

BILL MARCUS, SA Advisor
News Photo

can simultaneously work with
the SA and provide some sort of
guidance, the Student Associa-
tion would achieve little.

 

Describing the controls of pro-
posed SA salaries, Klavonic told
Pitt News reporter Mike Miller
that in the absence of a super-
visory body, SA members would
be restrained by their own hon-
esty.

Further. Klavonic doubted that
any workable supervisory body
could be established.

The matter is not reducible to
one of piracy versus integrity.
The Student Association is frag-
mented. its operation chaotic.
If it is obvious that the Commis-
sioners are not calculating thiev-
es. it is equally obvious that they
lack the acumen necessary to run
their organization smoothly.

Lawson. more vocal in his cri-
ticism of Markus is Klavonic.
seems to feel that the advisor
should be more of a comrade
than a counselor. Of his work-
ing relationship with Markus.
Lawson said he gets the
feeling with him that daddy has
to check on little boys deci-
sions.“

Unfortunately, daddy must.

There are no formal guidelines
for the conduct of SA members.
few set jurisdictions. little cohe-
sion. The Commissioners have
exhibited repeatedly a marked

unconcern for bureaucratic pro-.

cedure and the time and caution
necessary to implement new
programs. They have substituted
for prudence a mercurial whimsi-
callity careening down roads ad-
mittedly paved with good inten-
tions.

Perhaps a more capable Stu-
dent Association could function
independent of administrative ad-
vice or consent. The present gov-
ernment has shown that any dim-
inution of the role of the SA ad-
visor would not be in the best
interests of students.

Quelling
g Complaints

by JERRY MYERS »
Sports Editor

 

Grumbling about the lack of facilities is a familiar
pastime of many Pitt students. and more often then not
they have legitimate gripes. In the case of the athletic de-
partment. Director Casimir Myslinski is determined to
quell the onslaught.

Getting wind of some undergraduate complaints re-
garding the availability of athletic facilities at the school.
Myslinski took immediate steps to alleviate the problem.
"Hes done some shifting around and even knocked a few
heads.“ commented Pitts-Publicity Director Dean Billick.

The athletic department has announced an extensive ex-
pansion in the availability of the Field House. the Stadium
the tennis courts. and some aspects of the Trees Hall com-
plex. Beginning Thursday. the Field House will be open
from nine in the morning until nine at night. seven days a
week. In past years the Field House was
closed on weekends and after, 6 p.m. in the
evening. _

Panther Stadium with its synthetic As-
tro-Turf will also be available to students
on an almost unlimited basis. The Stadium
will be open from noon until darkness, sev-
en days a week, with a supervisor on hand _
with equipment for students to use. The _
only time the stadium will be barred from X
recreational activity will be during sched- DEAN BILUCK
uled events.

A supervisor will also be provided on the tennis courts
behind Trees Hall. Physical education classes in the morning
present the only restriction in the use of the courts. In addi-
tion to that. locker room facilities in Trees should be extend-
ed some time next week. The locker rooms will then be open
untilnine.

“Mr. Nlyslinski is unbelievably concerned with the stu-
dents.“ said Billick as he announced the changes. "Hes very
vehement about this. Hes especially concerned with the sta-
dium and the Field House."

Billick is aware of the isolated position the athletic de-
partment holds in relation to the University proper. Geogra-
phically situated a good distance from campus, when a stu-
dent attempts to make the hike up the hill to the athletic
buildings, he wants to find them open. Now he might not
get turned away.

new season ticket holders will receive their seat locations on

a first-come. first-served basis following the deadline.“

The tennis team will be "fighting for points and a win"
marked Coach Fran Webster concerning Saturdays competition with

Akron. The netters will be trying to boost their 2-7 season record.

This is the first time the Pitt netters will meet Akron in tennis

competition.

Webster classifies their strength to be the same as that of (jar-

“Akron is an above average
team,” commented Webster. “Our
boys will have a real tough time
against this squad.”

7 You can afford it while _ _
you’re still young enough to en joy it.

~ g _ . _ , Having the want is one thing. Having the

« ‘ ~ “ " - ' » " ~ - r ' » - A - wherewithal is another.Thetrouble with being
young is that all too often you have the one
without the other.

But the 1971 MG Midget is something else again.
Here is a true sports car for under $2500*——
the lowest price you can pay for the real thing.

In this case the real thing includes a race-
winning 1275 c.c. engine. Racing-type rack-and-
pinion steering (2.83 turns lock to lock) for cool,
crisp driving. Heavy—duty suspension for

superb road—hugging. Disc brakes up front for
straight—line, non-fade stops. Twin reclining
bucket seats. And full sports car instrumentation
with an electric tach.

Which only goes to show that, even though MG
has been engineering sports cars for over 40
years, there’s no generation gap. For the name
of your nearest Austin—MG dealer and
information about overseas delivery, dial

(800) 631-1971 except in New Jersey

where the number is (800) 962-2803.
