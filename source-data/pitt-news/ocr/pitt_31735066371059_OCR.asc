Pitt political group

elects new president

By Michael Adebimpe
The Pitt News

Before she transferred from Dickin-
son College in Carlisle, Pa., to the
University of Pittsburgh a couple of
years ago, little did Lynn Fischer, a
21-year-old senior, know that she
would be the president of the College
Republicans at Pitt.

On Friday, Nov. 1, Fischer, a com-
munications and English writing ma-
jor, was unanimously elected to a one-
year term as president. College
Republicans is a student affiliation of
the national Republican Party.

Fischer, the second girl in a family
of four, said she became active and in-
terested in politics when she was 18
years old.

“I am not in the Republican Party
just because my parents are
Republicans. I am much more conserv-
ative than my parents were,” Fischer
said, adding that she was encouraged

to be in the Republican Party by her
“conservative school and professor of
political science.” '

Fischer said she was looking for a
party and political leadership that can
put America back on its feet, a party
that can create a newer and better idea
for the nation.

“I found just exactly that in the
Republican Party,” she said. Fischer
analyzed some of the ideologies of the
Republican Party that really engaged
her interest. She said the Republican
Party believes in a very strong defense,
taking government out of business, less
waste, free trade and enterprise, and
sound economic policy.

Fischer pointed out that she and the
Republican Party don’t believe in many
social programs. “A social program
should be measured by how many peo-
ple need it and not by how many peo-
ple can just use it,” she said. Fischer
added that she believes the government

YMCA seeks food
for less fortunate

By Bobby Smouse
The Pitt News

Only 21 days remain until
Christmas, and for most of us here in
Pittsburgh, that means only three more
weeks until our second grand feast of
the holiday season. But for the unfor-
tunate of our city, a Christmas feast is
only a dream at best.

This past Monday, Pitt’s Collegiate
YMCA began collecting non-
perishable foods for the needy so that
some of those dreams might become
reality.

The YMCA is working on the food
drive in conjunction with the Pittsburgh
chapter of the Salvation Army, and will
only be involved with the collection of
donations. The Salvation Anny will be
doing the actual distribution of the
food.

“We’re working with the Salvation
Army because they have a much bet-
ter idea of who is in need of the food

Graduate chem students

By Joe Krzywiecki
Staff Writer

Five graduate students of Pitt’s
chemistry department have been
honored as the first recipients of the
Safford Award.

Those sharing the honor are George
Bandik, Wayne Henderson, Jane
Vickel and Robert Rumelfanger. The
award, named after Dr. Hurd Safford,
professor emeritus of chemistry at Pitt,
symbolizes excellence. The recipients
of the award receive $100 plus a gift
certificate.

There were nine semi-finalists from
a field of 76 graduate teaching
assistants chosen by their supervising

than we do,” said Paul Hanus, the
YMCA’s program director. “Most of
our food will be distributed to needy
families here in the Oakland area.”

Although promotion for the food
drive was extensive, response so far
has been low.

“Hopefully donations will pick up
toward the end of this week,” Hanus
said yesterday. “We sent letters to
many of the local businesses in Oakland
promoting the drive and also to all of
the Pitt sororities and fraternities.
We’re hoping that their support will
make the food drive a better success.”

The YMCA’s food drive will con-
tinue until next Friday, Dec. 13. Dona-
tions can include all non-perishable
foods packaged in cans, jars, boxes,
etc. Money will also be accepted.
Donations will be collected this week
at a booth in the Concourse of the
William Pitt Student Union between 11
aim. and 1 p.m. and at the YMCA of-
rice in room 730 of the Student Union.
Next week donations can only be of-

fered at the YMCA office.

coordinators. Dr. Richard Howe, assis-
tant chairman of the chemistry depart-
ment, said, “There are many outstand-
ing graduate students in our depart-
ment. This is one way we can
recognize their outstanding perform-
ance.” «

Howe also said that the Safford
Award will be given annually, and the
number of winners each year will vary
‘depending on the quality of the
nominees.

Howe said he was pleased that the
award was named after Safford. “I am
proud that Dr. Safford’s achievements
are being recognized, and that this
award is being named after him.”

College Bowl arrives on campus

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

Move over Trivial Pursuit. The hot-
test new trivia game on campus is the
“College Bowl," a contest in which
two teams of four students each try to
answer questions covering, as Craig
Fishman, one of the leaders of last
year’s championship team put it,
“anything under the sun.”

career, Safford modernized the
undergraduate chemistry department at
Pitt. Safford also developed an in-
strumental analysis course that has
become an important part of the
chemistry baccalaureate program.

In addition, Safford has actively
researched electro-analytical chemistry
and published papers on polarography
and coulometry. Safford has also writ-
ten an undergraduate laboratory hand-
book for the chemistry department. He
was named professor emeritus in May
of 1985. -

Since retiring, Safford has helped the
chemistry department by advising and
interviewing incoming chemistry
majors.

This year’s competition got under
way the Monday before Thanksgiving
in the Student Union.

According to Doug Trumpower,
recreation chairman of the Pitt Program
Council, the diversity of questions re-
quires “a very wide range of
knowledge.” Most good teams, he
said, include students who specialize in
the sciences as well as the liberal arts.
Trumpower points out that, although
they are comparatively few in number,
College Bowl participants seem to
represent a fairly good cross section of
the university, both at the
undergraduate and the graduate level.

Generally, teams for this event are
“recruited.” Last year, Fishman and
Bob Benner, both of whom are in Pitt’s
medical school and have outstanding
science backgrounds, decided to work
together. The two decided to look for
players who majored in the humanities
and social sciences. Fishman said he
feels they were lucky.

“We found an ad in The Pitt News
advertising for College Bowl players
with science backgrounds,” he said.

College Bowl competition has only
recently returned to Pitt after an
11-year absence and lacks signiﬁcant

university attention. According to .

Trumpower, matches generally “don’t
get audiences teams bring their
own.” He eventually hopes to broad-
cast contests live on campus radio.
Benner said the event’s publicity
might be greater if it took place earlier
in the term. He sees the competition as
conﬂicting with ﬁnal examinations.

ticipating in the College Bowl? In a
tangible sense, teams can advance to
regional and, ultimately, national com-
petitions of various kinds. Intangibly,
as Fishman states, “One really doesn’t
gain morally or philosophically
there’s no real basis for knowing
what’s asked.”

The former team co-captain added,
however, that teamwork is the most im-
portant thing which comes out of the
College Bowl — there has to be
cooperation for a team to be successful.

Peru-Chile —- Separate rebel groups
bombed several public buildings in
both Peru and Chile yesterday. In
Lima, guerillas blew up three electrical
towers and used the resulting blackout
as cover while they bombed banks in
the city’s commercial center, where
homes of leading politicians are
located. Officials blamed the Maoist
rebel group called’ Shining Path. No
one was injured in the attacks.

In Chile, explosions killed one
railway worker and injured nine others
as rebels bombed a railway line and

Criminal Verdict

A three-judge court appointed by President Mar-
cos of the Philippines acquitted General Fabian C.
Ver and 25 other men. 24 of whom serve in the
military, of charges implicating them in the assassina-
tion of opposition leader Benigno S. Aquino. This rul-
ing was in contradiction to the ﬁndings of the Agrava
Commission, a board of independent civilian citizens
appointed by President Marcos to undertake a fact-
ﬁnding mission, which had refuted the government’s
contention that the assassination was committed by a
lone communist gunman and had charged that “the
evidence proves the complicity of General Ver. ’ ’ Just
hours after the court’s decision, Gen. Ver was
reinstated as Chief of Staff of the Philippines armed
forces.

The results of this trial illustrate with terrible clarity
the unmistakable reality of political life in the Philip-
pines; the violation of individual liberties, the use of
coercive force, and any number of grave social in-
justices are commonplace and continue to ﬂourish
under Marcos’ corrupt regime. Furthermore, Gen.
Ver’s acquittal drives home this painful point: The
prevailing political norms of nepotism and military
rule will ensure that those individuals who act to main-
tain Marcos in power are free to do so by whatever
means necessary, i.e., atrocities may be perpetrated
with impunity.

United States’ support of the Marcos regime in the
Philippines is no longer tolerable. If President Reagan
is really serious about upholding the democratic prin-
ciples that are so dear to his heart, he will act im-
mediately by threatening to halt all military aid to the

Philippines, unless President Marcos begins to initiate V

steps toward genuinereform of what is currently a
vile and reprehensible form of government.

Some will argue that the Philippines are vital to
American security interests in the South Paciﬁc.
While the accuracy of this statement is doubtful at
best, it is our contention that even enslavement to the
Soviet forces of communism is preferable to a
deliberate alliance with an evil, corrupt force such
as the Marcos regime.

Regan’s Bias

While White House Chief of Staff
Donald Regan is hardly the first public
ﬁgure to demonstrate his ignorance of
women in this country, it is important
that we not simply shrug off his recent

_ comments concerning the extent to

which women have a concerned and
knowledgeable interest in international
affairs. Regardless of the context and
intent of these comments, such negative
stereotyping of women as uninterested

and uninformed members of our socie-

ty adds dangerous legitimacy to
previous criticisms of the Reagan ad-
ministration’s position on women. One
is forced to question the administra-
tion’s outlook on the role of women in
the public sector and international af-
fairs, for it is precisely this type of
comment that reinforces the biases
which impede women in ﬁnding mean-
ingful employment in the ﬁelds of
foreign policy and national defense.
The unfortunate reality is that Mr.
Regan’s remarks reflect general
misconceptions about women which
pervade many of the institutions of this
country. That these misconceptions are
damaging to the academic and intellec-
tual integrity of women is obvious. It
is in the interest of all women and men
that these misconceptions be addressed.

Interest in and knowledge of national

defense and foreign policy cannot be

attributed to gender. For every woman
who may be uninterested or unin-
formed on a given issue, there is a man
who lacks the same interest and/or
knowledge. In fact, contrary to these
misconceptions of women, recent

Gallup polls have indicated that women

as a whole are more interested in issues
concerning world peace than men.
I-low conveniently this fact is ignored,
or worse yet, distorted and dismissed.
The distortion stems from the inter-
pretation of women's interest and con-
cern as being passive, a mild form of
anxiety regarding nuclear war. The
truth is really the exact opposite. One
has only to look at the growing number
of women enrolled in graduate and
undergraduate programs of interna-
tional affairs and the increasing number
of mobilized women‘s groups and
caucuses addressing these issues to
realize that there is nothing passive
about their positions on national
defense and international affairs.
Women’s interest and commitment to
these issues stem from the same fac-
tors which motivate the Reagan ad-

. ministration‘s foreign policy objec-

tives: the importance of the role the
United States, as a world power, plays
in the international arena. These prej-

Letters to the Editor

women can no longer be ignored. It is
time to acknowledge the position of
those women who have dedicated their
careers to international and public af-

fairs, both professionally and

academically, and to recognize those
who are not just professionally in-
volved but are also concerned and
knowledgable.

Bold Statements

My letter is in regard to Kevin Bold’s
misleading article entitled “If Guns
Are Outlawed, How Will We Shoot
The Liberals?” He seemed to imply
that by getting rid of the liberals we will
somehow curb the powers of our evil
government.

First of all, Mr. Bold equated taxa-
tion with theft. If someone steals my
property, he commits this act against
my will and without my consent. This
is not the case when a republic taxes
its citizenry. In that case the govern-
ment has the consent of the electorate
to tax them. In return, the government
provides needed services. Hardly a
case of thievery.

Then Mr. Bold stated that liberals
support a tax increase to offset the
deﬁcit. Whose deficit are we talking
about anyway? I believe most of it
belongs to the conservative hero,
Ronald Reagan. In 1985 he proposed
$250 billion for the military. In 1981
he pushed through his $100 billion an-
nual tax cut which mainly beneﬁted the
wealthy. So now we have a $200
billion annual deficit. Reagan has ac-
crued more debt in his ﬁve years in of-
ﬁce than all his predecessors in the last
191 years. Don’t blame the liberals for
something‘ the conservatives have
created. Wasn’t it the conservatives
who offered a “revenue enhancement”
package this year?

Kevin Bold also stated that 70 per-
cent of the government funds for
welfare programs were spent on ad-
ministration costs. Which welfare pro-
gram were you referring to and from
which source did you get that ﬁgure?
According to the governor’s executive
budget for 1985-86, Pennsylvania spent
1 percent of the $2.642 billion for the
Dept. of Public Welfare on administra-
tion costs. Of that amount, $708
million was given out as cash grants
through the counties. They spent 17
percent of that amount on administra-
tion costs. Only 6.47 percent of the
state budget goes toward cash grants.

Finally. Mr. Bold said that govern-
ment is a necessary evil. Oh. come on!
If it wasn't for the government dams
in our tri-state area Pittsburgh would‘ve
been underwater in November.
Government funds medical research,

. . ;udices..and...mi$9Qr!¢sP!i9!1§._.?Ib99E-. pr9rn9!e.s.fre.e.99n3P¢titi<>h by Preaking - 

up monopolies, subsidizes higher
education, promotes commercialization
of space, ﬁxes our streets and provides
many other needed services. A govern-
ment is a tool by which a society can
live with itself based on the philosophy
embodied in its constitution. It’s neither
evil nor good. The conservative as well
as the liberal would increase the power
of the government to achieve their
ends. Each may perceive the other’s in-
tentions as evil while perceiving his
own intentions as good. '
Well, Kevin, it looks like your col-
umn is made up of fallacies which you
advertised with your disgusting sensa-
tionalist headline. Let me just end my
letter by saying your joking title is not

funny. Remember, Kevin, a lot of peo- .

ple have been executed and many are
being killed today for espousing their
views. Making light of this tragic cir-
cumstance is an insult to the dignity of
The Pitt News and the students who
read your column. The least you can
do is to apologize for your irresponsi-
ble witticism. ‘

No Losers

On behalf of Central Blood Bank, I
would like to thank the students, faculty
and staff of the University of Pittsburgh
who took time from their busy
schedules to share the gift of life as part
of the Third Annual “Great Pitt/Penn
State Blood Challenge” which took
place between November 1 and 20.

While Penn State won the popular
vote with 7,097 units of blood collected

sity of Pittsburgh, there were no losers.

should cut some social programs in
order to eliminate waste in the welfare
program.

Fischer argued that “before you can
back up any arguments that the welfare
recipient will be severely hurt by cuts,
you have to prove that there is not any
excessive waste in the welfare pro-
gram. T here’s more to the welfare pro-
grams than just a mere waste of it. I
don‘t think the government can afford
excessive waste.“ she added.

Fischer analyzed some of her
priorities during her term of office. “I
would like to establish the Pitt chapter
of College Republicans as a strong and
recognized organization — make sure
that even when I graduate, it will con-
tinue,” she said.

Fischer said she would also like to
increase the membership by encourag-
ing “conservative students” to join the I
College Republicans. ’

“A lot of students went to insure
their futures. They want better educa-
tion, better housing and they want to
be able to get a good job after
graduating from college. These and
much more are the issues of concern
to the Pitt Republican Party," she
explained.

Fischer had a lot ofpraise‘ for Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan. “He is a very
successful president. He has ac-
complished so much withinhis term of
office. such as reducing inﬂation.
reducing unemployment, strengthening
the military and advocating peace to the
point that we can negotiate with the

College Republicans president Lynn Fischer

Soviets." she explained.

Fischer added that “people are more
patriotic and proud of theircountry to-
day than ever before. People have the
feeling of living in a strong country and
being proud of America."

said she sees in the Reagan administra-
tion is the budget deficit. “With the
cooperation of the Senate and Con-
gress, I believe President Reagan [will]
solve the problem of the deficit,” she
said.

Fischer predicted that if the economy
continues booming and the president
successfully carries his program
through 1988, “the party will also win
the 1988 presidential election.”-

She said she regrets the fact that there
is no Republican on the Pittsburgh City
Council. “It’s pitiful,” she said. “It’s
also poor representation of the city of
Pittsburgh.”

Fischer's achievements since assum-
ing office include increasing the A
membership of her organization and
meeting with the national president of
the College Republicans, who gave her
some useful advice regarding Pitt’s
Republican organization. She is also
calling a meeting on Thursday, Dec.
5 in the fifth floor lobby of the William
Pitt Union for all members and in—.
terested students.

Fischer wants to be remembered as
the Pitt Republican president “who

- finally organizes a permanent political
organization at the University of Pitts-
burgh’s main campus."

lShepherd

prepared
on and off
the court

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

Not too often in a coach’s career
does an individual like Darryl
Shepherd come along. For
Shepherd, life is more than just
basketball. Head coach Roy Chip-
man understands this better than
anyone. ‘
“Darryl has his life in order, and
he has it together,” said Chipman.
“Basketball is not Darryl’s only
outlet in life after graduation.”
Off the court, Shepherd may be
more gifted than on the hardwood.
In April, Shepherd will graduate
with his degree in information
science while balancing his com-
mittment to basketball and a deep
desire for a music career.
“Music is something I take very
seriously,” said Shepherd. “Just
like school and basketball, I spend
a lot of my time trying to be the best
I can. I do a lot of producing in the
studio whenever I can" fit the time
in.
‘‘I guess you can say it’s all a
challenge, and that’s part of my be-
ing a free spirit," Shepherd reveal-
ed. ‘‘I want to produce and perform
music. I want to make a career in
music, because I don’t want just a
nine-to-five job. Informationscience
is something to fall back on. To me
a nine-to—five job is the safe way
out.”

For Shepherd, nothing has come

Pitt senior forward Darryl Shepherd

easy. He accepts challenges and
has let hard work and determina-
tion make it all happen. “Without
achallenge, it wouldn’t be fun.
Basketball is a challenge,” ex-
claimed Shepherd. “That’s why l’m
playing for Pitt in the Big East Con-
ference.” -

“Darryl has worked very hard in
school, at music and at basket-

ball," said Chipman. “lt’s all been-

a part of his_becoming more mature
since coming here [to Pitt from Du-
quesnej” .

Assistant coach Joe DeGregorio
is another person well aware of
Shepherd’s talents and humble
personality. “Darryl is an easy go-
ing kid,” said DeGregorio.
“Everyone knows about his music
abilities, but it carries over onto the
court, too. No one runs the court
better, and he’s probably the best
athlete on the team.”

Whether or not he is the best.

athlete, he’s certainly the most
gifted. One of the great athletic
skills he possesses is a 42-inch ver-

tical leap that allows him to touch'

the backboard with his head,
despite being only 6-6. In addition
to having outstanding leaping abili-
ty, Shepherd has also qualified for

_the NCAA Track and Field Chain-

pionships in the 110-meter high
hurdles. ‘

DeGregorio said of Shepherd,
“He’s the best boost off the
bench.” According to his coach,
Shepherd does more than just play.
“He understands college basket-
ball and has accepted his role off
the bench,” said Chipman. “Dar-
ry|’s forte is to shoot, but he’s also
a team player.”

“His priorities are straight. He’s
getting a‘ degree and there’s a
promising career in music in front
of him,” said Chipman. “As for the
team, Darryl does a good job with
leadership, and he responds well
under pressure.”

Darryl Shepherd certainly does
respond well to pressure and
challenges of all kinds, but more
importantly, he leads by example.
As for this season, Shepherd said,
‘‘I want to have a great year and to
continue to do the things l’ve been
doing.” '

There certainly isn’t anything
wrong with that. If he can do just as
he has, Darryl Shepherd has
nothing to worry about, though his
Big East opponents and musical
peers will.

Miklasevich

  A class act with a big heart

By John Zaphyr
Assistant News Editor

He’s not as fast as most basket-
ball players. He doesn’t have as
smooth a shot either. He can’t jump
very well. Yet, despite all his
weaknesses, Matt Miklasevich is a
winner.

“Obviously, I’m not the best
athlete, but I’m a smart player,”
said Miklasevich. ‘‘I’m not the
quickest or the highest jumper.
People say I can’t pass, but I rare-
ly throw the ball away. But the
coaches know that when they bring
me in, I'll do the job and I’ll do it
well.”

Miklasevich, a 6-7, 230-lb. senior,
has been doing the job for the Pitt
Panthers for the past three years.
Although he has seen limited action
at forward and center and will most
likely see limited duty this year, he
does not think of himself as a role
player.

‘‘I’m not going into the season
looking at myself as a role player,”
he said. “As a senior, I’m going to
become more of a leader both on
and off the court. And when I do get
into the game, I’ll be looking to go
in and help the team win.”

Miklasevich said that he sees the
Panthers as winning more this
year, and that incentive will drive
him to play even harder.

“l’lI do whatever it takes to win,”
Miklasevich said. ‘‘If it means
knocking someone over to get a re-
bound, I'll do it. If it means diving
on the floor to pick up a loose ball,
I’II dive.

“I made a pact with Joey David
that we would win the Big East
before we graduate, and I'll do
anything to achieve that goal.

“Obviously, I’m not the
best athlete, but I ’m a smart
player. ”

— Matt Miklasevich

We’re going to take the Big East
like storm troopers this year, and at
the end of the season, we’re get-
ting that ring.”

Miklasevich has reason to be op-

timistic about his team’s chances _

this year. The Panthers have been
bolstered by the arrival of stand-out
freshman Jerome Lane and junior-
college transfer Tico Cooper, and
they have not been hurt by gradua-
tion — like some of their toughest
Big East competition.

“Last year, the top teams like
Georgetown and St. John’s were
just a little bit better than us — just
enough to win the games we
played against them,” said
Miklasevich. “This year, though,
the team is so much stronger, so
much quicker, so much better than
last year.

“And it's not just the new guys
who are making us better. Keith
Armstrong is a lot stronger and he’s
playing much harder, and Joey
David is also improved.”

Miklasevich is not only looking
forward to improved play this year
but is also awaiting graduation this
spring. He will earn his degree in
industrial engineering this year.

‘‘I want to get my degree and '

come up into the business com-
munity‘in the Pittsburgh area," he
said. “I want to be an entrepreneur

and get my hands into as many
pots as I can.”

Miklasevich would also like to
start basketball clinics to teach
young people the basics of the
game.

“Me and my sister [former Lady
Panther star Pam Miklasevich]
would like to teach kids how to play
basketball,” he said. “And not just
the mechanics either. Most high
school coaches only teach the kids
the fundamentals — I want to be
able to show young basketball
players how to think on the court.
I want to teach them to be smart
ballp|ayers.” -*

Being a “smart” basketball
player is something Miklasevich
prides himself in. He is the team’s
best foul shooter, hitting 81 percent
of his free throws last year, ‘and he
can always be found around the
ball.

“If you’re smarter than the other
guy, it makes the game that much ‘
easier,” said Miklasevich. “Look at
a guy like Chris Mullin. People say
he isn't the best athlete but he
always seems to make the plays.
It's because he knows what the
other guy is going to do -— it’s
because he is always thinking
ahead, and [he] is a smart basket-
ball player.” _

What type of basketball player
would Miklasevich like to be
remembered as? ‘‘I want to be
remembered as someone who
came out every game and played
hard and always held his head up,”
said Miklasevich. “Whoever
watched me play, I want them to
see that I know how to play the
game. I would want them to know
that I’m a smart player and a win-

CONFERENCE

By Jim Urban and Bob Travers

Syracuse Orangemen

Head coach: Jim Boeheim (Syracuse
’62).

Returning starters: Rafael Addison,

J _ 6-7, (Sr.), 18.4 ppg, 5.8 rpg; Dwayne

Washington, 6-2, (Jr.), 15.4 ppg, 2.9
rpg; Michael Brown, 6-4, (So.), 8.4 ppg,
2.3 rpg; Rony Seikaly, 6-10, (So.), 8.1
ppg, 6.4 rpg.

Key loss: Andre Hawkins, c, 5.5 ppg,
4.2 rpg. .

Strengths: The Orangemen are
picked by everybody to win the Big
East hands down, and for good
reason; everybody returns from last
year. Addison may be the best player
in the conference. Everybody knows
what “the Pearl” can do, and Seikaly
may turn into a dominating center.
That may just add up to a conference
championship, but there is pressure
that goes along with it.

“The pressure could get to be too
much if you let it,” Addison said, “but
you just have to set your priorities and
budget your time.”

Last year, the Orangemen had the
best sixth man in the nation in Wendell
Alexis. This year, he is a starting for-
ward, and may turn out to be a sleeper
in the conference. He can score; he
proved that last year (10.2 ppg, 6.0
rpg). Now there are no weak links on
the team.

‘‘I think the players feel if they play

the way they are capable, they can
win,” Jim Boeheim. “We are proud to
be picked first, but we aren’t worried
about a pre-season ranking.”

Weaknesses: Are there too many
stars on this club and not enough
basketballs? Washington burst onto
the scene as a freshman in 1983-84
and everybody thought he was the
second coming of the Lord. Now, two
years later, he has come under severe
criticism by notable authorities from
the basketball world. Claims that
Washington over-possesses the ball or
shoots too much have surfaced. Will
he dominate the league like he did two
years ago, or will he fit into the system?

‘‘I think the Big East will be much
more competitive this year,” Alexis, his
own teammate said. “There will not be
one player dominating like there was
in the past.”

' lf Washington goes off on his own,
he will get the glory, but will be a
weakness for his team. "If Washington
plays within the bounds Boeheim sets
for him, Syracuse may go all the way.

Outlook: The Orangemen are one of
the few teams in the conference that
could win the National Championship.
There are three bona fide NBA players
on this team in Washington, Addison
and Alexis. Seikaly is not far behind.
The talent is there, they just have to
put it together.

Georgetown Hoyas

Head coach: John Thompson (Prov-
idence ’64).

Returning starters: David Wingate,f,
(Sr.), 6-5, 12.4 ppg, 3.6 rpg; Reggie
Williams, f-g, (Jr.), 6-7, 11.9 ppg, 5.7
rpg; Michael Jackson, g, (Sr.), 6-1, 7.0
ppg, 1.6 rpg.

Key losses: Patrick Ewing, C, 14.6
ppg, Bill Martin, f, 10.9 ppg.

Strengths: With the glaring exception
of Patrick Ewing, Georgetown returns
much of what took it to two consecutive
championship games. Horace Broad-
nax and Michael Jackson will give the
Hoyas a strong and experienced, if

‘ unspectacular, backcourt. The Hoyas

are explosive up front with Reggie
Williams and David Wingate teaming
alongside center Ralph Dalton.
Despite playing a background role to
Patrick Ewing for four years, Dalton
has seen considerable action and does
bring some experience to the middle. \
Weaknesses: The Hoyas are without
Patrick Ewing, the dominant force in
the Big East for the past two years.
Georgetown simply is not the same
team without him. Ewing will be
missed. The biggest question mark in
the nation’s capital this year is whether
Ralph Dalton can be a full-time player.
He was effective off the bench, but this
year he is the starting center.
Outlook: Georgetown had what
many consider to be the greatest col-
lege basketball team ever assembled
last year and only two of those players

are gone. ‘‘I think the people we are 1

going to be primarily relying on this
year will be Michael Jackson, Horace
Broadnax, Reggie Williams, David
Wingate and Ralph Dalton,” said Hoya
coach John Thompson." “Those kids
are going to be the nucleus of our
team. That’s the challenge of college
athletics — reconstruction — and I en-
joy that challenge.” His returning

Reggie Williams
Chaz PalIa/ The Pitt News

starters should make the challenge a
little easier for Thompson, but the

‘ starters must remember Ewing is no

longer there to anchor the team and
the offense must be spread around
more. The older players on this team
are proven winners and they -know
what it takes to win. “lf they remember
how hard they had to work to get to the
championship game, then it’s a hell of
an advantage,” Thompson said.
“That’s the value of tradition.”

Georgetown was ranked No. 1 in
pre-season polls by just about
everyone. This year they fall anywhere
from the Top 10 to nowhere.
Georgetown has the remnants of a
dynasty left, and the Hoyas are not
about to crumble in the space of one
year. Look for Georgetown to run up
some large hotel bills wherever the
tournament is played. They’ll be there
for a while.

    Boston College Eagles  

Head coach: Gary Williams (Mary-
land ’68).

Returning starters: Roger
McCready, 6-5, (Sr.), 14.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg;
Dominic Pressley, 6-3, (Sr.), 10.3 ppg,
3.0 rpg; Trevor Gordon, 6-9, (Sr.), 6.6
ppg, 5.2 rpg.

Key losses: Mike Adams, g, 15.3 ppg,
3.3 rpg; Stu Primus g, 8.8 ppg, 2.4 rpg;

Strengths: Boston College may have
the best head coach in the nation in
Gary Williams. Williams is in his third
year and has compiled a 63-30 record
at Boston College. Not too ‘bad con-
sidering those were three years when
Patrick Ewing and Chris Mullin
dominated the conference.

McCre‘ady may prove to be one of
the better swingmen in the conference.

“Roger is as good a forward as there
is in the Big East,” Williams said. “He
plays best in the big games; he was
outstanding in the NCAAS against
Keith Lee [Memphis State] and Mark
Alarie [Duke].”

Weaknesses: Williams must find
someone to replace point guard
Michael Adams, who paced the Eagles
to the Final 16 in three of his four
seasons while being named second
team All-Big East three years in a row.

“When you lose players like Adams,
Primus and Talley, you are losing
quality leadership.as well as ability,”
Williams said.

 ('4'

it seems that two players will be
competing for the point guard spot.
The front-runner is 6-0 sophomore
Jamie Benton.

“The point-guard opening is going
to allow Jamie the opportunity to show
what he can do,” Williams said. “He’s
an outstandingshooter; hopefully, he’ll
be a little stronger and leaner this
year.” _

If Bentoncannot handle the job,
then freshman Dana Barros will be
thrust into action. Barros averaged 47
ppg during the Massachusetts State
Tournament. He is more of a scorer

than Benton.

“Dana had proven he can score as

well as anyone on the high school.

level,” Williams said: ‘‘He’ll be called
upon to handle the ball more in col-
lege, and we’re hoping he can con-
tinue to score.”

The Eagles will have to find a point
guard if they are going to finish high
in the Big East.

Outlook: Because of Williams’
coaching, the Eagles will most likely
win a few games they would not nor-
mallywin. That will get them into the
NCAA tournament. Look for Boston
College to finish in the middle of the
Big East race. McCready will be their
top player, but Dominic Pressley will

also prove to be an important part of
. -. their game. '

 

 

St. John’s

Redmen  

Head coach: Lou Carnesecca (St.
John’s ’50).
Returning starters: Walter Berry, 6-8,

_ (Jr.); Willie Glass, 6-5, (Jr.).

Key losses: Chris Mullin, g, 19.8 ppg,
4.8 rpg; Bill Wennington, c, 12.5 ppg_,
6.4 rpg. _

Strengths: Walter Berry is back for
the Redmen and this year he will step
out from behind the formidable
shadow of Chris Mullin. Berry was se-
cond in team scoring last season.
Willie Glass is the only other Redman
returnee from last year’s Final 8 team
and should add-scoring punch to the

.front three. One big plus for the

Redmen this year should be the
emergence of Mark Jackson at guard.

“Jackson has taken over Mullin’s
role as leader,’’ Carnesecca said of the
6-4 junior. Jackson averaged 5.1 ppg
coming off the bench last season.

“Practice has been very tough,”
Jackson said of St. John’s practices
this year. “There are a lot more jobs
open and the guys are playing harder
because of that. We lost Chris Mullin,
but life goes on.”

One other thing working in the
Redmen’s favor this year is head
coach Lou Carnesecca. Now in his
eighteenth season as St. John’s
coach, Carnesecca has posted a
20-win or better season 13 times.

Weaknesses: St. John’s was ‘hit. as

-hard as any team in the nation by

graduation. Gone is Chris Mullin, only
the best player in St. John’s history
and a three time All-America. Besides

Walter Berry

Chaz Palla/ The Pitt News
losing Mullin, the Redmen are without
center Bill Wennington. That means
the only center on the team is
freshman Marco Baldi, a 6-11 native of
Aosta, Italy. The Redmen are inex-
perienced this year, and have no
seniors on the roster". Two
sophomores, Terry Bross and Shelton
Jones, will see a lot of action and could
be the key this season between a
repeat of last year’s success or a long
season of rebuilding.

Outlook: This could be a very trying
year for the Redmen. They have little
or no experience at several key posi-
tions and virtually no bench strength.
The bulk of the scoring will be done by
Glass and Berry up front. That means
Baldi will have to do more than just
take the tipoff. He needs to rebound

- and feed Berry and Glass. If St. John’s

fails to get the ball inside, the Redmen
are in for a long season.

Providence Friars

Head coach: Rick Pitino. '
Returning starters: Don Brown, 6-2,
(Sr.), 9.5 ppg, 1.7 rpg; Harold Starks,
6-0, (Sr.), 7.4 ppg, 3.2 rpg; Steve
Wright, 6-10, ($0.), 4.4 ppg, 3.4 rpg.
Key losses: Ray Knight, C, 8.5 ppg,
6.0 rpg; Keith Lomax, f, 8.2 ppg, 3.4
rpg; Brian Waller, f, 9.2 ppg, 2.8 rpg.
Strengths: “Our strong points this
year are going to be shooting and're-

' bounding,” Pitino said. Look for Brown

and Starks to do most of the shooting.
Brown may win some games for them.
Starks is a good passer and should
again lead the Friars in assists this
year. He and Brown will make a nice
combination.

Weaknesses: The Friars lost their en-

Y.-
tire front line last year and the center
this season-will most likely be Steve
Wright, the fon/vard of a year ago. The
Friars must score more this year, but
that may present a problem for Pitino
in that he does not have one returnee
who averaged in double figures last
year. —

Outlook: A rebuilding year for the
Friars, Pitino will need huge scoring

from Don Brown (upwards of 20'

points), and he will have to find a
center that can rebound. Providence
will be _looking to freshmen Darryl
Wright and Bryan Benham for help.
The Friars are not going to be a
challenge for the league title this year.
Big surprise.

  Seton Hall Pirates  

Head coach: P.J. Carlesimo (Ford-
ham ’71).

Returning starters: Andre McCloud,
6-6, (Sr.), ppg 20.8, rpg 7.2; Mark
Bryant, 6-9, (So.), ppg 12.2, rpg 6.8;
James Major, 6-0, (So.), ppg 9.8, rpg
1.8; Martin Salley, 6-5, (So.), ppg 8.8,
rpg 4.6.

Key losses: Ransom Eaves, g, ppg
9.0, rpg. 2.4

Strengths: Andre McCloud is as
good as there is in the Big East, and
if Seton Hall had a few more players
like last season's scoring champ, the
Pirates could make a run at the title.
As it is, however, McCloud is surround-
ed by players still feeling their way
through the Big East. At least three
sophomores will start for the Pirates.
That’s a strength? It is when you con-

. sider all three started as freshmen and

this year will be another step on the
Seton Hall climb to respectability. Mark
Bryant, one of the sophomores,‘
averaged 12.2 ppg last season and is
back with McCloud at forward. It is
there that the Pirates will be strongest.

Weaknesses: inexperience will be the

demon fighting the Pirates this year. A V"

Three of four returning starters are
sophomores. While that bodes well for
seasons down the road, it could be
another year in the Big. East cellar for
Seton Hall. Another problem for the
Pirates is a lack of height. Seton Hall's
starting lineup this year will. average
only around 6-6. The tallest player with

any experience at all is '6-9 Mark 

Bryant.

Outlook: Seton Hall has been the‘
doormat of the league for years and
this season will probably bring more of
the same to the school in South
Orange, N.J. The Pirates are among

the Big East’s youngest teams and

they will have their hands more than

full when up against the likes of

veteran Syracuse and Georgetown
teams. Still the Pirates are capable of
upsetting some of the teams in _the
league, particularly on days when
McCloud has help putting the ball in
the hoop. Should either Bryant or
senior guard Ricky Burton develop in-

to scorers themselves, the Pirates

could steal more than a few games this
yeah

Villanova Wildcats

Head coach: Rollie Massimino (Ver-
mont ’56)

Returning starters: Harold Pressley,
6-7, (Sr.), 12.0 ppg, 7.9 FPQ; Dwight

_ Wilbur, 6-2, (Sr.), 7.5 ppg, 2.0 rpg.

Key losses: Ed Pinckney, f, 15.6 ppg,
8.9 rpg; Dwayne McClain, f, 14.8 ppg,
4.1 rpg; Gary McLain, g, 8.0 ppg, 4.3
assists per game;

Strengths: The ’Cats were hit hard by
graduation,_but Massimino returns 10
lettermen, including two starters, plus
a recruiting class ranked among the 10
best in the nation.

Altoona’s Doug West, the Penn-
sylvania MVP of the Dapper Dan
Roundball Classic heads that class.
He will see action immediately.

“This team is going to have to
mature faster because they're going to

1 get thrown to the wolves,” Massimino

said. ‘‘I hope the freshman become
sophomores by January.”

The Wildcats do have some promise
at guard. Dwight Wilbur has seen his
share of action the past two seasons,
and junior Harold Jensen, last year’s
sixth man,‘ may have been the ’Cats’

best guard bytournament time last

season. If he plays like he did in the
NCAAs last spring, Massimino will at
least have a foundation to build from.

Connecticut Huskies

Head coach: Dom Perno (U Conn
’64).

Returning starters: Earl Kelley, 6-1,
(Sr.), 19.4 ppg, 2.4 rpg; Tim Coles, 6-7,
(Sr.), 9.8 ppg, 7.0 rpg; Ed -Williams,
6-7, (Sr.), 8.5 ppg, 3.3 rpg.

Key losses: Flay Broxton, f, 13.9 ppg,
5.4 rpg; Alvin Frederick, f, 12.9 ppg,
5.3 rpg.

Strengths: Earl Kelley is one of the
best guards in the ‘conference. He has
averaged double-figures in each of his

first three years at Connecticut. He will _

need to look for support from Williams
and Coles. '. .
“Our three seniors Wlll lead us this

. year,” Perno said. ‘‘I don’t feel any

pressure. Our young people are play-
ing well. I like to see that.”

“We will need several players to pro-
vide Earl Kelley with offensive
assistance,” Perno added. “We un-

. doubtedly have more depth than we

have had since the early ’80s. We also
have a key ingredient l like and that is
experienced seniors leading the way

_ with a large number of younger players ‘ ‘

challenging for starting jobs or playing

time.” ‘
Weaknesses: “The most important

factor is the development of our big

, people,” Perno said. “Not only re-

bounding, but our ability to score in
close.” ‘

If Kelley does not get any help from
the big men, it could be a long season
for the Huskies. 5

Outlook: If the big men play well, U
Conn could finish as high as fifth. If

Kelley is a one-man team, U Conn is
.. ,l."f.l'.°.Uble-. . ‘ "

Weaknesses: The one major
weakness is that the Wildcats have no
proven scorer. With the graduation of
McClain, McLain and Pinckney,
Villanova lost over 39 ppg of offense
and 13 rebounds per game. That is not
a good sign, especially in a conference
like the Big East, where agressive
defense is the name of the game.

Another question mark on Villanova.

is at the center position. Pinckney was
the main man at that spot for four
straight years. Now Massimino is left
to choose between Chuck Everson
and Wyatt Maker. Do you remember
when Pitt blew _out Villanova by 23
points last year? Well, that was one of
the few games where Everson and
Maker saw extensive action. Between
the two, they accounted for 2.8 ppg of
offense, not too impressive.

Outlook: It could be a long year for
Villanova. West will most likely develop-'
into one of the better young players in '
the Big East, but Massimino will be
building for the future. Look for teams
to exploit the Wildcat front line, and
Villanova to finish as low as sixth.

Jerome eyes
life in the
fast Lane in
the Big East

By John Enright
Staff Writer

Freshman Jerome Lane will be a
key player this season on a talented
Panther basketball squad striving
for Top 20 recognition.

But Lane, a 6-6 Parade All-
America guard/forward, doesn’t
see it that way. ‘‘I’m taking things
gradually,” said Lane.“ln high
school I didn't have to practice
hard, but in college, even if you’re
talented, you have to work your butt
off. I have to earn my spot on the
team. i don’t feel any pressure. I
want to please myself,’ not the
fans.”

Head coach Roy Chipman feels
his prize frosh will help in a big way.
“He’s an excellent passer,
ballhandler and offensive re-
bounder. l thinkhe has the ability
to move right into the Big East and
make an immediate contribution for
us.”

Lane's credentials certainly give
Chipman reason to be pleased. He
led the St. Vincent-St. Mary High
School team in Akron, Ohio, to the
State AA Championship while
averaging 27 points, 14 rebounds,
and seven assists per game. Lane
played in both the McDonald’s All-
America game and the Dapper Dan
Roundball Classic last season. He
was a member of the gold-medal
winning North squad at the Na-
tional Sports Festival in Baton
Rouge, La., this past summer. And,
Basketball Times listed Lane as the
second best shooting guard pro-
spect in the nation.

Despite all of Lane's
achievements, the adjustment to
college basketball has not been
easy for him. “Practice hasn't gone
as well as I thought it would go,"

Deal!

Great Off-Campus Living!

Pitt freshman Jerome Lane

said Lane. ‘‘I could do better. rm
not a practice player. I have to prac-
tice better or I'll be finding my seat
on the bench.”

Despite this self-criticism, Lane
said that he feels that practice has
improved of late: ‘‘It is not as hard
as it was in the beginning, when we
did a lot of drills. Now, we’re learn-
ing a lot of plays and practice isn’t
as hard.” .-

Lane has already been com-
pared to two other Panther greats.
As Street & Smith Basketball Year-
book explains, “Lane can do it all.
He is cut from the Magic Johnson
school of basketball and he’ll have
the Pitt fans going wildthis winter.
Lane can score, rebound, pass the
ball, leap with the best around and
he’s a team leader. He’s Pitt’s best
basketball player since Billy Knight
more than 10 years ago. Or Charles
Smith.”

Lane, the pre-season favorite for
Big East Rookie of the Year, re-
mains reserved despite all the at-
tention he has received. He said he
has to improve his defensive play
and jumping ability.

When Pitt signed Lane, every
basketball writer in the East pencil-
ed him in as a starter for the Pan-
thers this season. Lane, for one, is
in disagreement with this theory.
He said senior Darryl Shepherd will
start the season in front of him at
the small fon/vard spot. Shepherd
is coming off an impressive year
which included double-figure scor-
ing in each of Pitt’s last five games.

Lane, however, said he doesn’t
intend to be a reserve for long: ‘‘If
I don’t start by the end of the year,
l’m'not fulfilling my goal.” And
Jerome Lane is one player who has
the ability to reach all his goals as
a Panther.

Q& A: Charles Smith  

in       

By Randy Miller

Pitt basketball star Charles

Smith is just beginning his sec-.

ond season in college, yet he
has earned the reputation of be-
ing one of the Big East Con-
ference’s elite. In his freshman
season, the 6-10 forward from
Bridgeport, Conn. was named
Big East Rookie of the Year in
leading Pitt to a respectable 8-8
conference record. Smith

"averaged 15 points and eight

rebounds per game last
season. This season he will
again be expected to carry both
the scoring and rebounding
load for Pitt, a team expected to
challenge for the conference ti-
tle. Already this season Smith
has averaged 22.3 points per
game in Pitt’s first three games,
including a career-high 28
against St. Francis. Smith was
voted to the Big East Preseason
All-Conference Team earlier
this season,iand he is expected
to make a run at All-America.
Said St. John’s head coach Lou
Carnesecca, “Smith is well on
his way
superstar in this league. You’re
not going to hold him down too

’ often if they get him the ball.’’

I caught up with Smith after
Pitt’s 94-45 victory over IUP.

Q. Being Pitt’s star player,
do -you feel pressure this
season as so much is expected

-3-, of both you and the team?

A. Well, there is definitely
pressure around me, but out of
that pressure there is good and
bad. If I hold up to the standards
and the expectations of
everybody and myself, then it’s
good. But if I don’t, hey, that’s
the bad end of it. I’m going to
try my best and go out and play
hard every night because I feel
the type of person I am, if I just
play at a high intensity level,
everything will just fall in as far
as points,
shots or whatever.

Q. What is it like playing in
such a prestigious conference
like the Big East?

A. It’s definitely competitive
in the conference. You have to
come out night after night ready
to play. You have too many
teams coming up from the
depths of the Big East. There’s
a transition, this year there’s not
a dominating center in the
league, and you can win with a
three-forward orientated team,
and that’s basically what we
have. So, night after night you
have to be ready to play.

' '~:)iv'-

Q. Who are your favorites in
the Big East this season and
who do you think are the best
players in the conference?

A. I feel Syracuse is definite-
ly the favorite. They have
players at every position. I feel
their starting five, plus maybe
the first two off the bench are
capable of scoring 20 points of
any given night. As far as
players, you have Walter Berry,
the Pearl (Dwayne Washing-
ton), Harold Pressley — there
are still so many players left in
the Big East. ~

to becoming a_

rebounds, block _

Q. Is there any one team or
person you look forward to
playing?

A. Not really, I’m just looking
forward to playing in the Big

East and playing different-

teams to get into the swing of
things. -

Q. What attracted you to
come to Pitt?

A. First of all, I stepped into
a situation where as Pitt had a
few good players and I felt when
I came in, the position that I was
going after, I can more or less

try to earn it. And they were .

seniors so if I didn’t earn it, I
could have it the following year.
Plus, you have Curtis Aiken
here and a few other young
players that would be here
when I was. I felt like, well, Gore
too was thinking about signing
and I thought it would be the
best. I

Q. How far do you think this
Pitt team can go this season?

A. I think as far as the Big
East is concerned, I feel we can
win it. If we don’t win it, Ifeel we
can finish in the top three. It’s
very possible.

Q. Do you feel that Pitt can
be the Villanova of 1985, where
if you don’t win the conference,

A. I feel we’ll definitely make
the NCAA Tournament. As far
as progressing in it, it’s going to
be very difficult. There’s going
to be a lot of competition there.
We’re going to just see what

what they think my weaknesses
are, because I’m kind of curious

in different games that I played,
there were flaws that I had that

There’s differences in all

too

much for Pitt women

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team
lost their home opener at the Fitzgerald
Field House to a hot-shooting West
Virginia squad 68-64. Lady Moun-
taineer center Georgann Wells paved
her team’s way to victory by pouring
in 16 points and grabbing 19 rebounds.
Pitt guard Kim Tirik paced the Lady
Panthers with a game-high 21 points.

West Virginia jumped out to a 10-4
lead as ﬂashy freshman Dionne Mor-
ris hit a jumper from the top of the key.
Pitt then outscored WVU 24-10 to
move ahead, and appeared to have con-
trol of the game. West Virginia battled
back with some sharp outside shooting
and went into the locker room trailing
by only three, 31-28.

The first half was clearly controlled
by Kirk Bruce’s scrappy unit. They
kept West Virginia out of their running
game and forced them to take a great
deal of long—range shots.

A mirror image second half would
have the Lady Panthers at 2-0. But
West Virginia came out of the locker
room with radar on their side and

.ripped Pitt from far outside the key.

Alexis Basil and Judy Eaton combined
for 22 second-half points and turned the
contest into a track meet.

Despite a valiant effort from senior
Tirik, the Panthers fell behind by 13
with only 7:44 left on the scoreboard

clock.- Coach Bruce wisely called a-
time—out and reorganized his team for
one final rally. -

Two Kim Gannis buckets cut the lead I
to 9, and the Lady Panthers were back
in the game with plenty of time remain-
ing. At this point both teams were
caught up in a full-court, turnover-
plagued race against the clock. l

Freshman sharpshooter Jill Sitlinger

went on a scoring binge and tossed in -

10 of Pitt’s next 12 points to cut the
WVU lead to four, then a Tabatha
Long layup pulled them to within two.

But the Lady Panthers were forced
to foul, sending the smooth Morris to
the free throw line. She calmly sank
both attempts and that was the
ballgame.

Despite his team’s poor shooting and
their disadvantage in the rebounding
margin, head coach Kirk Bruce seemed
pleased with the effort. “I was pleased
with the way they hustled and battled,
back, Bruce said. “We were down by
13 at one point and could have quit
right then, but we kept plugging away
and took them down to the wire.”

When asked how the loss would af-
fect his team, Bruce confidently
responded, “They showed me a lot of
character. West Virginia was making
a lot of tough outside shots, some low
percentage shots. If we apply the same
type of defensive pressure in the future,
a lot more games will go in our favor.
We’ll be all right.”

"eGore leads Pitt into battle tomorrow

3‘ _

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

When the name Demetreus Gore is
mentioned or heard, the first word of
association is exciteinenr. The 6-5
sophomore from Detroit, Mich., is not
only as exciting as his name sounds,
but he’s also a very talentedathlete as
well.

In only his first game as a Panther,
Gore’s first three baskets were rim-
rattling slam dunks. For Gore, that’s
just what he enjoys doing. “I like to
excite the crowd when I’m out
there,”said Gore.

Coach Roy Chipman has gone on to
say about his acrobatic play that,
"Demetreus must learn that you don’t
get any more points for degree of dif-
ﬁculty

Although somewhat overshadowed
at times by teammate Charles Smith,
Gore had an above-average freshman
season. He finished second in scoring
to Smith by averaging 9.2 points per
game and was second in assists with
50. There is, however, a need for
improvement.

Last year, Gore started off strong of-
ferisively, encountered a mid-season
slump, then played well in the final
stretch of ballgames. Areas of improve-
ment for Gore are his shooting and his
overall defensive play. These are must-
have improvements to insure a more
consistent performance over an entire
season. i

“The most important thing
Demetreus must do is play under con-
trol," said Chipman.’ “He’ll be that
much more effective when he does that.
Demetreus Gore has matured and that
means he should be that much better
as a sophomore."

No one realizes that improvements
are needed more than Gore himself. “I
must improve upon my overall game,

I especially my shot selection, and I must

 

 

play more under control by taking bet-

_._ gter shots, said Gore. “I.worked hard‘

play with a high level of intensity
throughout the game, offensively and
defensively.”

Chipman said that he feels his fine
shooting guard has improved for the
1985-86 season. “Demetreus has
matured a lot, both on and off the
court," exclaimed Chipman. “He’s
more serious about things now. He’s
worked very hard on his game and has
become more well—rounded.”

Another person who has taken notice
of Gore’s upgraded work ethic is assis-
tant coach Joe DeGregorio.
“Demetreus has put in a lot of extra
time after practice,” remarked
DeGregorio. “Because of the extra
hard work, you’ll see Demetreus show-
ing better judgment while on the
court.”

Gore hails from the west side of
Detroit, not exactly the safest of com-
munities. Along with the harsh en-
vironment of an inner city comes a lot
of trouble.

Gore survived the city’s negative
aspects and escaped to Pittsburgh. “It’s
a relief to be here,” he said. “I’m a
lot more relaxed here. I still miss
Detroit, though. There were things go-
ing on there I didn’t like.”

As for on the court, Gore is a very
serious player. He brought with him a
32 ppg average from Chadsey'High
School and the distinct honor of being
named Mr. Basketball in Michigan. So
why did this brash youngster choose
Pitt in the first place?

"‘I chose Pitt for three reasons,”
answers Gore. “The city atmosphere
first of all — I lived in the city all my
life. And secondly. the Big East fits my
style of play much better than, say, the
Big Ten. The Big East is the best con-
ference and it makes you a better
player. “I also chose. Pitt for the
challenge. I wanted to come to a pro-
gram on the rise and to help make it
even better.”

The Sporting life

The Pitt News, December 4, -1985

By Bob Travers

Here it is already the end of the
semester. Seems like just yesterday
Purdue scored to make it 31-30 and
was going for the two point conversion.
So here we are at the end of the
semester and the end of the year. A few
loose thoughts to tie up:

0 Jim Wacker, the head football
coach at TCU, is my choice for Sports-
man of the. Year. Wacker voluntarily
turned in evidence that a TCU booster
had given cash to several top Horned
Frog players without W.acker’s
knowledge. He suspended all the
players involved and blew the 1985
season in a single stroke, but he saved
something much more important.

0 Imagine how boring this year’s
NFL season would be if it were not for
the Chicago Bears and William “The
Refrigerator” Perry. The NFL is put-

conformity. Here’s a call to bring back
grass fields and ﬂashy players.

and Notre Dame the last two weeks of

the season, but the only decent team

ting fans to sleep with its parity and‘

0 Penn State may have pounded Pitt‘

they beat all year was Alabama. I don’t
think the Lions have enough to handle

Oklahoma. I hope I’m wrong on this-

one.

° I think the Big Ten is the best
basketball conference in the nation this
year. Michigan and Illinois are two of
the top ﬁve or six teams in the coun-
try, and Indiana, Purdue and Iowa
could all end up in the top 20. I think
the ACC is a close second and the Big
East third.

0 North Carolina will win the basket-
ball title this year. Just a feeling after
watching them destroy ‘the field in the
Great Alaska Shootout over the
weekend. -

0 Of all Pitt’s varsity teams, there is
not one that is just plain awful, and a
number of them are very good. Unfor-
tunately for them, at a city school like
Pitt they don’t get the attention they
would at a place like Penn State or
Florida, where the university is the
whole world. V

0 ‘Some have suggested The" Pitt
News should cover intramurals at Pitt.

of the Week

Pitt senior wrestler Kyle Nellis is The Pitt News Athlete of the Week.

 

Chz ll/T e

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

The Pitt News Athlete of the Week
is senior Kyle Nellis of the Panther
wrestling team. Nellis, a team co-
captain, was named Outstanding»
Wrestler at the Lock Haven University
Invitational tournament this past
weekend.

Enroute to his first place finish, the
former Shaler High School standout
defeated four opponents. In his first two
matches Nellis easily handed Dan
Moody of Slippery Rock a 16-7 deci-
sion and downed Willie Metzger of host
Lock Haven 9-5.

The turning point in the tournament
for Nellis came about in his third match
when he pinned Leo Bailey of
Oklahoma State after trailing 6-2 at one
point in the contest. The win for Nellis
over Bailey certainly helped his cause
in being named MVP as the latter was
ranked among the top eight wrestlers in
the country at the 134 lb. weight class.

To cap off his stellar performance
Nellis defeated Penn State's Joe Hadge
in the finals with a decisive 8-0 shutout
victory.

“Well this is a good start, but with
another good individual performance
this weekend at the Penn State Invita-
tional, I’ll then have a good chance for
a spot on the East-West All Star Team
in Febuary,” said Nellis. “I may even
get a national ranking.”

Despite winning 24 matches as a

sophomore and 29 more as a junior, a _

trip to the National tournament has elud-
ed this ﬁne athlete. Getting to nationals
has been a major obstacle for Nellis
since he arrived at Pitt four years ago,
after coming fresh off a Pennsylvania
State Championship his senior season in
high school. .

“Kyle has done just about everything
else since coming to Pitt,” said Nellis’
Coach Rande Stottlemyer. “He hasn’t
qualiﬁed for Nationals. His best chance
was his sophomore year, after finishing
third 'at EWLs (Eastern Wrestling
League Championships), he was the last
guy not to get a wild card. So he's had
some bad luck.” -

“This is my first major college tour-.
nament win since high school, so I'm
starting to come around," Nellis ex-
plained. “This gives me more con-
fidence. A win like this builds con-
fidence in your style and in your way
of doing things.”

“This weekend will be a better in-
dication of his position," added Stot-
tlemyer. “If he wins again this week he
should be ranked among the top eight

‘ in his weight class, but there's a very

tough group of competition at Penn
State.”

Going into this season Nellis was 13
victories shy of fomier Pitt All-America
and current assistant coach Jeff Jelic’s

career win mark of 81 victories. After .

raising his record to 10-1 on the season
at Lock Haven, he may break the record
in Happy Valley. However, for Nellis
the record takes a back seat to what he
really hopes to accomplish. The only
loss of the year on his record occured

NFL Roundup

By Thomas Danyluk

N iners close in on Rams in NFC West

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Like a phoenix, the San Francisco
49ers.have risen from the ﬂame. Three
weeks ago, Bill Walsh’s troops were
staggering along with a 5-5 record.
Since then, three consecutive victories
have vaulted them to within a game of
the division-leading L.A. Rams. On
Sunday, the 49ers whalloped the sup-
posedly resurgent Washington Red-
skins 35-8 with the help of a big-play
defense that hasn’t yielded a touchdown
in 14 quarters. The 49ers will collide
with the Rams this Sunday and must

‘ win to gain control of their own playoff
destiny. Look for SF to take the Rams
easily, then go on to win the division.

New Orleans Saint Earl Campbell
‘has made a minor comeback of sorts.
The ex—Oiler workhorse had gained
234 yds. in his last two outings while

carrying the football 57 times. Camp- '

bell, one time the most devastating run-
ning back in professional football, had
quietly disappeared from the list of
NFL superstars since the demise of the
mightly Oiler teams of the late ’70s.

Had Campbell ran around defenses in-
stead of the running through them, he
still may be capturing rushing titles and"

wearing an All-Pro tag around his
neck.

Shakespeare would have loved the
Buffalo Bills, the NFL’s version of a
classical tragedy. Owner Ralph Wilson
has a dual role in the storyline, both
as the antagonist and as a personiﬁed
tragic ﬂaw. He refuses to pay the high
prices that accompany quality players,
and therefore, his team always ﬁnds a
poor seat in the NFL theater. Not too
many years ago, the Bills were a bruis-
ing playoff contender, but since 1982,
they have found their way into an in-
escapable losing quagmire. Wilson did
make one honest effort to improve his
team's overall play; he changed the col-
or of their helmets from white to red.
Sorry Ralph, exterior decorating
doesn’t ﬁx leaky pipes. Unless Buffalo
can sign a top quarterback with a can-
non for an arm and develop a sound
defense, it’ll be “Boi1, boil, toil and
trouble” for the Bills.

“It ain’t over till it’s over.” An
overused phrase perhaps, but certain-
ly as true as it is trite. The Minnesota
Vikings were trailing Philadelphia 23-0
with less than nine minutes to play in
the contest. The Vikes then scored
touchdowns on four straight posses-
sions and sqeaked out a thrilling 28-23
win. Their last touchdown came on a
picture—perfect 42-yard pass from

Wade Wilson to speedster Anthony
Carter. with 1:11 left on the clock.
Philadelphia’s last—ditch effort to save
the game failed when Ron laworski’s
pass was batted down on Minnesota’s
4-yard line as time ran out.

The Chicago Bears have come down
to earth, and not due to the hefty ton-
nage of “The Refrigerator.” The new
Monsters of the Midway were literal-
1y blown out of the sky by a potent
Miami offense as the Dolphins
massacred the previously unbeaten
Bears 38-24. Miami jumped out to an
unimaginable 31-10 halftime lead, then
held on to improve their record to 9-4.

The outcome of this matchup
hinged on several key factors. First,
Miami had excellent ﬁeld position
throughout the entire ﬁrst half, which
aided in their lightening-quick scoring
drives. Second, quarterback Dan
Marino’s passing was able to expose
the weaknesses of the Bear 46 defense.
This, in turn, opened up the usually
anemic Dolphin running attack.
Chicago then had to abandon their
original game plan, which is to win
games with pressure defense, and play
catch-up football, something they
haven’t had to do but once this 1985
season. Third, the Dolphins were able
to apply adequate pressure on the

The Pitt News, December 4, 1985

continued from page 17
at the 142 lb. weight class where
Nellis ﬁnished third at the Eastern
Nationals in Norfolk, Va.

“The record is a nice thing, but
all it means is that I wrestled more
matches than Jeff (Jelic),” says
Nellis. “The record is in the back
of my mind; being an All—American
is in front of my mind. All-
American is the indicator of suc-
cess.”

Success is not something new for
Kyle Nellis, whether it’s on the
wrestling mat or in the classroom.
Upon graduation from Shaler High
School, Nellis left behind one state
championship, one state runner-up
ﬁnish, and that traditional wrestling
school’s career victory total. More
importantly, he ﬁnished No. 2 in
his graduating class. _

Since arriving at the University
of Pittsburgh he’s continued his
scholarship in the electrical
engineering program. Currently
Nellis is carrying a 3.2 grade point
average and he is an active member
of Athletes in Action and also the
Fellowship of Christian Athletes.

Kyle Nellis

As for inspiration, Nellis looks
to prayer and the rewards of suc-
cess. From a good talk at a
Fellowship meeting Nellis is fueled
by a quote he follows in hopes of
reaching his goals: “No reserves,
No regrets, No retreats.”

“I want to look back at my last
year and be happy,” says Nellis.
“Otherwise I’ll be a frustrated old
man.”

Well, if he should continue along
the same path that he’s started,
Nellis will be a very happy man.
No matter how far he does go, one
thing is for sure — Kyle Nellis will
still be a success.

Honorable Mention: Charles
Smith — The sophomore forward
on the men’s basketball team scored
54 points in two Panther wins over
the Thanksgiving break.'.He had a
career high of 28 points against St.
Francis on Thanksgiving eve.

Kim Gannis — The senior guard
on the women’s basketball team
had 18 points in the Lady Panthers’
season opening victory over St.
Vincent.

Chicago quarterbacks (they had six
sacks) and expose their well-hid inade-
quacies, especially those of Steve
Fuller. (Note: The 70-degree heat in
Miami could have provoked some

thawing remarks in regard to William
Perry, but pro footba11’s “tons of fun”
had received enough unfounded
publicity and abstention seems quite
appropriate.)

The Pitt News, December 4, 1985

Mario Lemieux: Some relief atlast

By Alan Abraham
Staff Writer

He is tall and elegant, smooth and ﬂeet,
ever courtly and visibly urbane. Mario
Lemieux epitomizes the very best sort of
Gallic hockey player — his place of
employment is the “Igloo.” There, his
excellence growing year by year, he has
become one of the National Hockey
League’s premier centers.

For Lemieux, Pittsburgh offers an
escape from the hotbed of fanaticism in
his native Montreal, where he was
already worshipped as the next French-
Canadian hockey savior. His presence
was in no small part responsible for the
Penguins jump from 38 points to 51
points in the standings and an attendance
hike of 130,000 (from 273,550 to
400,707) last season. Numbers that caus-
ed owner Edward DeBartolo to recon-
sider any immediate decision-making on
moving the franchise until May.

I If Wayne Gretzky is “The Great One’ ’
then Mario Lemieux is “The Best.” “He
has proven himself game after game,”
said Penguins’ General Manager Ed
Johnson. “We’d like to keep him happy
for a long time. You look at the guys who
have been great players out of this league
— Laﬂeur, Bossy, Laroche — he’s

broken every record they have.”

“We‘ve been preparing Mario. for
three years for the media pressure,” said
Bob Perno, who watched over Lemieux
even in his junior days for his partner,
agent Gus Badali. “We knew three years
ago he was going to be the best. Gus
Badali handled Wayne Gretzky when
Wayne had some problems, the same
pressures, the same successes. We’ve
steered Mario with the same advice.”

Pen’s coach Bob Berry is especially
proud of the way Lemieux handled his
ﬁrst year in the NFL. “Mario came into
a new city and a new country, speaking
a new language and appeared at shopp-
ing malls, banks and in other situations
that required a tremendous amount of
poise and intelligence.”

Lemieux was tagged for stardom ear-
ly on, and just keeps on living up to ex-
pectations. He came to the Penguins from
the Laval Voisins of the Quebec Major
Junior Hockey League, where he broke
a host of records. He collected 133 goals
and 282 points in 70 games there, shat-
tering Guy Laﬂeur’s record. of 130 goals
and Pierre Laroche’s point record of 251
points. His point scoring streak of 61
games is also a league record. He is sec-
ond, all-time, with 562 career points and
sixth in goals (247) despite at least two
seasons less than any of the players ahead

of him.

Lemieux is an athlete made to delight
the connoisseurs of Montreal. Just as they
cherish their ﬁne cuisine, noble architec-
ture and sophisticated culture, they surely
adore Lemieux’s artistry on the ice.

Here, in the beer and pretzel city of
Pittsburgh, Lemieux’s challenge is not to
carry on a cultural heritage, but rather
to establish a new tradition for a Penguin
franchise on the verge of extinction or
relocation.

“I love to play under pressure,” said
Lemieux. “It’s easier to play in the states.
There’s less pressure for a guy from
Montreal. Up there, guys see you every
night playing in junior hockey, and the
media pressure is much greater.”

Lemieux’s 100 points last year make
him only the third rookie ever to hit that
mark —— and that on the second worst
team in the National Hockey League. He
was selected the NHL’s Calder Trophy
winner as rookie of the year, as well as
The Sporting News’ and the Hockey
News’ top rookie. He also
topped the league’s stars, veterans and
rookies alike, when he was selected Most
Valuable Player of the 1985 NHL All-
Star game. He then garnered another
MVP trophy to put alongside that one
when his 10 points topped Team Canada,
three silver medalists at the World

Hockey Championships.

In French, the word le mieux means
“the best.” The Penguins have bet the
future of their struggling franchise on
Lemieux’s broad shoulders, conﬁdent
that the best is yet to~come.

Penguin“ Marketing Director, Paul
Steigerwald, has taken all of this to the
bank. “Mario is going to be the next Pitt-
sburgh ‘ sports superstar,” predicts
Steigerwald. “He’s worth the price of ad-
mission himself.

“When Mario came to Pittsburgh for
the first time,” Steigerwald said, “I
could tell right away that he was just a
humble, soft-spoken, easy-going kind of
guy. As the season wore on, his sense of
humor and his easy demeanor started to
come out.”

Like many other athletes, Lemieux got
a strong fatherly push toward athletics.
A month before Mario’s sixth birthday,
Jean—Guy, Mario’s father, took him to a
Ville Emard Hurricane practice. Ville
Emard is the blue-collar section of Mon-
treal and the Hurricanes are a Mighty-
Mite hockey team (8-10 year-olds).

Mario had been skating at a rink, own-
ed by his uncle, since he was three, and
his father had spent hours working with
him, teaching him how to come down the
ice against a defenseman, how to put his
body between a defender and the puck,

I - Page 19 

and how to carry the puck inside the blade
of his stick. The rest is history.
Today in Ville Emard, proud mer-
chants display Mario Lemieux growth
charts. Similar charts were given away
before the Penguins-Canadians game, last
October. And now they hang not only in
the windows of Ville Emard, but in lit-

tle boys rooms, college dormatories and '

business ofﬁces everywhere.

Lemieux cuts one of the most entranc-
ing ﬁgures on NHL ice. The dashing
Cary Grant, the swift, graceful Fred
Astaire and the charming, Latin Julio Ig-
lesias of his sport. He plays the game
neatly and gracefully, with a sort of man-
ly charm, so deft are the hands which out-
wit NHL‘ netrninders.

During the summer months you can
ﬁnd Lemieux at the La Valle Du
Rechellieux golf course, located in the
mountains just north of Montreal. It’s
quiet there, in the mountains. It’s been
quiet in Pittsburgh for some time. The
last celebration was held in honor’of the
Steelers, ﬁve years ago.

As Pittsburghers slip into the cold and
dark days of yet another winter, Penguin
followers are craving for a winning
hockey team. There is but one major link
that connects the Penguins and their
diehards to success. It is spelled
L-E-M-I-E-U-X!
