M Bans Press, Public

At Ouster Discussions

Action to eliminate..internal elections in Men’s Council
was delayed at the most recent meeting of the legislators
while.they passed a’ resolution,to ban members of the “press

and public” from any .MC m

missal is to be discussed. 0

According to the MC constitu-
tion a member can be dismissed
for failure to- attend meetings,
failure to execute his duties prop-
erly, and misconduct’ inoﬁice. ‘

The _“banning resolution” fol-
lowed Steve Passamane’ck"s pro-
posed amendment to the by-laws
of the MC constitution.

Julius 'Vogel, newest council
member, and James Silverman
bo.th opposed the amendment on
the. grounds that it would place a
councilman’s membership in the
hands of the executive board,‘
and that council as a whole would
have little voice in the matter.

' “Unnecessary Meetings”

Silverman felt also that such
an amendment would make two
MC meetings necessary which
really to discuss a dismissal mo-
tion are not necessary.”

Passaman_eck’s argument, how-

ever,‘ was that by permitting the

executive committee to act on the
matter ﬁrst any plots by rival
councilmen to have another dis-A
missed would be abolished.
-After a short discussion Passa-
maneck’s original amendment was

. defeated "and as a result, dismissal
"of councilmen will be kept within

 

eeting Where a member’s dis-

 

banned from any MC meetings
where a councilman’s dismissal is
to be discussed until the “facts
are certain.” ‘ '

‘He felt— that public opinion
would be lessened if-such a move
were made. To'prove' his point’
he citedithe “Garber incident.”
He referred to" the recent ﬁasco
in Student Congress in which an
attempt ‘was made to have Jay
Garber ﬁred from his position of
assemblies’ chairman for inefﬁ-
ciency. The move was‘ defeated
but, as Goldstein stated, a good
deal of public opinion was arous-
ed. ’ ’

Vote Unanimous ,

Goldstein’s “banning resolution”
found favor with all the council-
men who voted unanimously to
insert it into their constitution.

As a result council can move
to dismiss fellow members with-
out ‘any publicity.

Two meetings will be held by
council. One to discuss a coun-
cilman’s dismissal, which will be
closed, and a second to vote on
the dismissal which will be open.

"The amendment to abolish in-
ternal_ jelections was to follow the
above resolution but Ronald Eek-

Dirty Says

SC Prexy

.By DAVE GREEN

Interfraternity Council at
its meeting Wednesday even-
ing voted unanimously to
abolish its long standing and
usuallypowerful election slate.

. Following a Student ‘Congress

.,open meeting Wednesday after-

noon concerning politics in student
activities -in which Student Con-
gress President Jack Burwinkel
termed politics at Pitt “as dirty as
they can get,” IF Council decided
to “discontinue the practice of
supporting a slate of candidates for
student government positions and
that "member fraternities should
not form such slates either formal-
ly or informally.” '

The motion was introduced by
Thomas Piemme and Elmer Shus-
ter. Dan Berger suggested the
amendment preventing individual
fraternities from ‘forming slates.

Discontinuing the controversial

for the present, a history of secret
political caucuses", burned meet-
ing minutes, expenditure of IF
fundson campaigns and assess-
ment of member fraternities" for
non.-support of the slate. S ‘
Until the spring of 1952, the IF
slate for years had enjoyed almost
unanimous victories in Student
Congress and. Men’s Council.
Last spring however, dissention

many of its members, not included
on the IF slate, formed the Merit
Party which copped six out of
eight SC.positions, but failed in
the Mens’ Council contest.

Action on the ending of the slate

afternoon at which _these lead-

slates. . ,

After a session of hot and heavy
debate Wednesday afternoon, Bur-
winkel, who chaired the—meeting,
suggested that formal action on
slates by the student leaders be
postponed until next week. In his
closing remarks “to-the assembly,
he came up with his contention
that “Politics at Pitt'in the past,
especially last year, have been
as dirty asthey can get.”

IF President Lud Lippert stated
at the open meeting that the pur-

formed to-select the best candi-
dates regardless of aﬁiliation, had
long been lost. '

came as a consequence of a meet-

"the industries of Pittsburgh that
they have come through in this

.“We are really assured now of a
‘medical center that will be one of
-the greatest in the world.”

The other $2,500,000 Pitt hopes

Chancellor, University of Kansas

"In these days when much is said about ‘adult
education,‘ we too often forget that a great
deal of adult education is daily carried on
by such instruments of public information

as The Reader's Digest. In my judgment,

The Reader's Digest is one of the powerful
and useful forces shaping the thinking of

_ our people in these difficult times."

The articles  each issue of The Reader’s Digest cover a
broad range of subjects: from travel and politics to science
and history, from humor and personal inspiration to head-
line news. Forty or more articles and a host of short subjects,
carefully chosen from hundreds of -publications. bring Digest

The wonderful thing about using Bartlett's _Fa-C

leads the reader into‘ thinking the writer is widely
read, but at the same time‘ affords a method of
easy transition from introduction to subject. Noth-
ing is more. appropriate, for example, for an arti-

bring, than, a choice excerpt from
Bartlett’s 1128 pages (exclusive
of index). ' ‘

’ , One of the magazine sections of iSun_day’s Pitts-
burgh Press carried anarticle by one of the na-
tion’s leading ‘authorities on“the. female ﬁgure.
Harry Conover, head‘ of the model agency by the
same name, revealed his views \on the super-slen-‘
derness; of today’s fashion models. ' .

-. Mr.‘Conover literally and verballydafnned the
.models who go -to outlandish, and
absurd extremes inian ieffortto
appear slim before the cameras
that plaster. them allFo_ver the
country in various ads and mag
azine covers. While the author
agreed that the models‘ must be
slim because the camera has the
_effect"_ of‘ adding ~_approximately
"10; pounds to the,.rnodel’s ﬁgure,
he (indicated. that he‘ was dis-

nj1a_yed,_at the emaciated, underfed women who pa_- .

traded around" in the latest styles. .

Dubbing some of these so-called model women‘

as nothing more than skit} and bones, Conover pre-
sented testimonials from ‘both men and women who-
agreed with him in even harsher words. Hdsbands
of these controversial clothes-horses admitted that

the strain of keeping many pounds underweight and

performing various physical acts. to insure’ the al-
most straight-up-and-down proﬁle had turned their
wives into nagging wenches who were so high-
strung that they seldom appeared human.

legs and non-existent bosoms were a disgrace to

,To get to the point of all this review, we agree
down to the last foundation garment with the views

presented by Conover and his cohorts. Personally, _

there is-nothing. more disgusting to the Amale eye
than the shadowy silouette of a woman that could
be a real WOMAN if she would let nature take its
course. -

One "of the worst possible things wecan imagine

is the horrible feeling one must get when he puts ,

his arms around one of these women and ﬁnds
himself scratching his own back. It's ridiculous!
It?s pitiful! And notonly that, it’s downright unfair.

tMost.men like to get tender and loving with a girl

at some time or another. But when they .take“a,

girlin their arms, they like to be able to feel at"

little something in their 'arms besides clothes and
skin_ covered bones. .

If women’s legs weren’t made "to be admired,
bathing suits would be ankle-length. The same goes '
for ‘the rest of the femaleform. If women would-

_ stop "worrying about what other women think of,

their ﬁgures, or what the models look like, or what
they think they should look like, we, and they,

would be a heckova lot happier and a lot more ap- .

preciative. Most men prefer gals with alittle meat’

on their bones and enough of a ﬁgure that they can," ~

Don Fanning, the Pitt swimming team opens its 1953 season '
against Miami of Ohio tomorrow night at the Pittsburgh

A letterman the past two years, Fanning will be lost
for the remainder of the season because of internal injuries.
‘His departure will leave Coach Ben Grady without an

Short on Sprinters

However, the Blue-and-Gold
tankers still boast ten returning
lettermen so Grady is looking for-
ward to another winning season.

“We are short on sprinters,”
he says, “but we have good
strength in most of the other
events.”

Although Grady would not com-

Miami, the ﬁns from Ohio are
bringing their ﬁrst swimming pro-

Ex-Stars Faded
With — Pavilion

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Sports Editor

_ Once upon a‘ time Pitt played West Virginia a basketball"
game and won. The score was 74-72 at the icebox pavilion
in the Stadium basement where 2365 fans tensely watched
the thriller as Pitt oﬂicials were closing its doors for keeps
after 26 years. ‘

As the tale goes, a couple of sophomores, Muggsy Car-

one of its greatest basketball up-

sets. But, unfortunately, the story
has no happy ending for the
pair;
' The ‘Field House days
haven’t been too fruitful for
Phillips or Carnahan but the
“jobs they did that February
. night, 1950 are worth retell-
ing. It’s a shame they didn’t
live up to their promise. Carnahan
Muggsy drew the most difficult assignment of the evening when
Carlson, searching for help, called upon the green sophomore to
stop All-American 6-9 Mark Workman from beating up his Panthers

 

Phillips

the way he tosses his elbows, hands, and legs around,” Doc recalled
in thedressing room after. that game. _

“So I told‘ the boys to play -Workman just the way he plays
you.” Before the game Carlson admitted that “we got a way to
stop him,” but wouldn’t reveal his secret weapon. It’s quite cer-
tain, though, that Carnahan wasn’t meant to be the secret weapon.

_Doc started Don Virostek on Workman, but he failed.
‘Then, he stuck George Radosevich, a hu y basketeer who doubled.
as a varsity football center, on the big fellow, but Mighty Mark
got away for two quick baskets and 'that was all. for George.

“Carnahan did the besttjob on Workman?’ Doc recalled. “In
our strategy we ﬁgured it was better to let him shoot fouls instead
of ﬁeld goals.” _ _

Carnahan’s efficient handling of the situation set the scene for
co-hero Phillips to go to work.’ With seconds remaining in the game
Scott took a pass near the pivot circle and slammed in a shot that
meant victory for the Panthers.

Today, though, with Carlson prepping his team for the Penn
State game, subs Carnahan and Phillips aren’t included in the
strategy to upset the_ Nittany and its star, Jesse Arnelle.

To stop State’s superior team Carlson may {have to resort to

a successful season.

could defeat Michigan. Never be-
‘fore in my coaching career did a
squad surpsise me so.” Peery went
on to say that the squad had prov-

chances of a top-notch year are

Matmen Hurt Physically

“But,” warned Peery, “we’ll
have to_ get into better physical
shape than we are at present._I
don’t think we were in the. best
shape for our ﬁrst three meets.”
Case, Michigan State, and Michi-
gan werevictims of the Panther
matmen by scores of 25-3, 19-7,
and 19-9, respectively.

“We have two weeks before our
next match, and we’ll spend. that
time trying to improve our condi-
tion,” continued. the mat coach.
“This will be our last opportuni-
ty to do so because after the
Army match, we won’t have time.”

Two More Injured

Meanwhile, the trip to Michi-
gan and .Michigan State added
two more wrestlers to the injured
list and the recovery. of a third.
Joe Solomon, 157 pounder, return-
ed to the squad after recoveging
from an ankle injury and scored
a pair of wins during the holiday
trip. .
