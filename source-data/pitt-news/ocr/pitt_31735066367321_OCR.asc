Finals System
Remains Same

As Last Year

,A major issue being considered
by the ‘University Senate is the
proposal for an “evaluation week”
to take the place of the current
ﬁnal week.

According to Dr. John Geise,
assistant chancellor in charge of
student affairs, the University
will follow the same program for
ﬁnals this term as it did last tri-
mester. 1

The present program allows the
instructor to give ﬁnals at any
time during the last week of class-
es in the trimester, during the
usual ﬁfty minute periods.

Under the proposal now being
discussed, the University would
retain the present 50-minute class
session but would utilize the ﬁf-
teenth week of each trimester as’
“evaluation week.”

This last week would be used
at the instructor’s discretion for
examinations, conferences, inter-
departmental seminars, or ﬁnal
classes. 1

Questionnaires on trimester
planning, sent to faculty mem-
bers, produced wide differences of
opinion. Eighty-eight per cent of
those who teach in the Academic
Disciplines preferred a ﬁnal ex-
amination week but were almost

Tape Program P

“Brain Washing” will be the
topic of a taped talk to‘ be pre-
sented every day next week by
the Dean of Men’s Office in 813
C1. ' 1

The tape will tell of brain
washing by the Communist in the
Korean War. The program is ori-
ented toward freshmen’men. A

“These programs will be both
informative and enlightening.”
Donald Van Houten, assistant to
the Dean of Men, saidf“,Brain
washing is a recent part of our
history. The evaluation of Amer-
ican society contained in the
speech still applies today.” 1

According to _Van Houten the
tape points to a lack of, values of
American people and explains
why Americans were susceptible
to brain washing in prisoner of
war camps.

A discussion‘ period conducted

by Men’s Conference instructors
will follow the tape.

Sessions‘will [be held today at
10 a.m. and.1 p.m.; tomorrow and

  iTwa Major Problems
City Council’s recent delay in granting approval to the
. Universi_ty’-s proposed $13 million dormitoryhas pointed
‘ out two major problems which must be solved before any
’;further plans are madeto bring more resident students to
‘ campus. _ .
 '' First, in the new domitory approximately 100 park-
1 ing spaces will be available for some 1800; resident students,
in-an area where parking facilities are already inadequate.
 . It has been pointed out that parking facilities are suf-
I ﬁcient since only,a small percentage of the present resident
I students have cars on campus. But thisis no indication that
Tinore would not like to have cars. Perhaps the reason they
ffdq not is because there is no place available to keep them.
{Such facilities should be provided by the University.
' if Secondly, no provisions have been made by the Uni-
, .,vers.i,ty'for a nearby outdoor" recreation area for the in-
creased number of resident students. This willlbe a problem
during the third term particularly, whenthe weatherinvites
fa game of tennis or baseball. Students who attend‘ the sum-
,n_1‘er‘ trimester last year can testify to this.
._  ;No doubt the University planners have given serious
consideration to these two problems. Apparently, they have
not yet come up with any speciﬁc solution, but they are still
I  going «ahead on the dormitory plans. ' ,
 It-is in the long range plans for the University to
.acquire- the ﬁve block area from-Schenley Quadrangle to.
 ”Bouquet St., for a parking and recreation area. However,
,5 negotiations for this have not yet begun, and the whole
 matter of purchase. seems rather indeﬁnite. It is not likely
I thatthis area will be purchased before Fall, 1962, the date
set for completion of the dormitory. L 
’ University students are not so scholarly that they can
becontent merely to sit in their rooms and study, getting
gtheier exercise by walking to and from classes.‘ I
.. They would also like to be free to bring automobiles to"
‘school, without having to -pay extravagant parking rates at
'3-the. local garages. _ _ . A
_  Hopefully, ‘the University will have answers to these,
difficult-ies in two weeks, when the City Council will again‘
consider the dormitory proposal.

V By John» Lowenthol

Rumor has it that there will be an election
tomorrow. I will be voting for the ﬁrst time, and
I am going to vote for Senator John F.zKennedy.
Here is why. ,_ _ .
_ The “experience” question: Kennedy and Vice-
President, Richard Nixon have

..,..,.,,.; . ....: .. .-

years. Both have been to numer-
ous foreign countries although
neither has been part of a formal
diplomatic ‘mission. . Nixon has
spentgmuch time . in foreign _
nations ‘at ceremonial functions;
Kennedy has spent virtually all .
his time studying conditions
wherever he went.

If Nixon ever had a signiﬁ-
cant idea about foreign affairs
or anything else, he certainly has been secre-

tive about it; when James Reston asked President

Eisenhower to name one important idea Nixon has
contributed to his administration Ike replied, “I
can’t think of one offhand.” '
Kennedy has Intellect

_Kennedy, on the other hand, has written several
thoughtful and scholarly books to "explain his ideas;
books such as “Why England Slept” and; “Strat-
egy of Peace.” Nixon, by his own admission (see
the friendly biographer Earl Mazo), does not read
much about publicaffairs or anything else; Ken-
nedy we is an avid reader, particularly, on .public
affairs. , '

Nixon’s goof on “Open End” (in which ,he was
unawareof a two—day old ‘administration decision
to suspend U—2 ﬂights) is embarrassingly clear
proof that Nixon has not been too intimately en-
twined in the nasty business of running a country.
Whence, then, the experience claim? Perhaps there
is something to it. After all, Kennedy has never
had theexperience of being stoned in a foreign
land. ‘

Nixon‘; Star ‘Is Hypothetical

Foreign policy: if debating were the essence of

» dealing with Khrushchev perhaps Nixon would be“

adequate in this respect. Some of us, however, feel
that debating is not the most important thing.
Robert Kennedy pointed out Wednesday that Nev-
ille Chamberlain could have~traded insults with
Hitler at Munich; he could not, however, have
stopped the Nazis, for England was not as strong
as Germany. The fact that-Lodge has won every
one of-his debates in the U. N. has not stopped
the U. S. margin of support there from declining;
last week we were unable for the first time (on
the question of Castro’s aggression charge against
the U. S.)‘, to muster a two-thirds -vote in our

I favor. Moreover there were solid blocs of absten-

tions from Latin America and the Middle East

(including Israel). 1 .
Nixon’s approach that ,“we are doing ﬁne; let’s

continue” smacks of the ostrich. Mr. Kennedy

realized the need for vastly improved technical
military programs ‘and. vastly expanded loan and
technical aid programs to foreign‘ nations. His
espousal of Gen. Gavin’s e“Peace Corps” of intelli-
gent, linguistically trained’ men and women to
supplement the high-living freeloaders now in the
foreign service is a splendid step in the right
direction.

Nixon says about foreign policy “I will not
appease or surrender any free territory to the
Communists.” When asked what’ his speciﬁc pro-
gram would be, he has answered, “I regard ‘Sen.
Kennedy’s .policies as dangerous, unwise, and en-
couraging to the dictator.” Do you know anymore
now than you knew before about Nixon’s ideas?
«I don’t.

‘Double-edged Republican. Chiconery —

Domestic policy: The big issue here has been

ﬁscal policy and federal spending. The blood of

anybody who has had a little economi'cs—and is
not simply trying to rationalize a selﬁsh class
interestshould boil at the chicanery‘ the Republi-
cans are trying to force on the nation here. Mine
does_whenever I read of Nixon addressing a mob
of lower-and-middle class people and telling them

how~ their taxes and their prices will rise ‘be-

cause of increased federal spending.

Nixon Threatens with Demon

He is capitalizing on‘ today’s mass unemploy-
ment by scaring the unemployed with the prospect
of more taxes. The fraud_ of Nixon’s position is
this: Neither Kennedy nor the Democrats stand
for an increased tax burden on the poorer classes.

The revenue for his massive program is to be‘
raised mainly byclosing current loopholes such as

depreciation and expense accounts which allow
giant corporations and trusts to escape with less.
than their share of taxes. Closing these loopholes
would result in, billions of dollars /of aditional
revenue. ~

The important thing, though, is that every time
the government provides a free-service from fed-
eral funds, the individual is relieved of having to
pay for this service himself. Federal spendinggin
short, means that the wealthier and the great cor-
porations pay for a greater share, and the poorer
for a lesser share, of what we all use equally.

Spending Hits Rich Nixonites

Great government spending, therefore, is bene-
ﬁcial to all but the wealthiest and the most power-
ful, to all but that single class that the Republi-
can party and Nixon represents. By providing
more free services, Kennedy would liberate more
money for workers to spend and would thus stimu-
late buying and the economy much more surely
than Nixon would by giving more and more proﬁts
to those who already have much.

For these reasons Senator Kennedy will pro-
vide us with great constructive leadership for the
future and he should receive the support of all
who think critieally and who do“ not vote simply
on the appeal of the stars and stripes.

Results of Lees’ Trip Abroad *

Paintings of Greece by Mrcler Lee, wife of English pro-
fessor Lawrence Lee, are on display for the month of Novem- ’
ber in the Office of Cultural and Educational Exchange, sec- '
ond ﬂoor, Amos Hall.

These pictures are part of the tangible results of the

Greek Committee scholarship awarded to Professor Lee.
Thee Lees spent the summei% '

months in Greece, where Profes-I
501* Lee wrote poetry.

Mrs. Lee is a professional paint-
er. This is her fourth one-woman‘
show. The paintings are oil on pa-
per.

It has been said that Mrs. Lee
works from a “sense of place,”
and accordingly the majority of
the pictures are landscapes. The
scenes depict the hills and har-
bor around the island of My-
kionos, where the Lees stayed.
Mykionos is near the famed is-
land of Delos.

Mrs. Lee’s paintings charac-
terize a definite individualistic
style. She says, “I am a tradi-
tional, but not an academic
painter. The scenes are from
reality, but simplified.”

Blue seemed to be the dominant
color, but as Mrs. Lee explained,”
What would one paint in Greece
but blue; the sky, the sea . . .”

Two portraits are among the
sixteen pictures being shown.

ever, one was done upon Lees’

arrival in spring, while the oth-

er was painted in late summer

around their departure time.

The interesting note. is the color
contrast of the green hills. of

early spring to the drab browns

of summer.

Color contrast is a characteristic
of Mrs. Lee’s style. But she as-,
serts, “I am unconventional, but‘
not an "abstract painter.” .

Irish Not ‘Up’ E110

Cats ]T;t€l1d
ilWin Streak
To Two '

By TED COLTON

Notre Dame was up but
Coach John Michelson’s new-
ly aroused Panthers were not
down. Prior to Saturday’s
gridiron classic between the
Panthers and the Fighting

Irish. there had been a feeling
that the Irish were ripe for an up-
set while the Panthers, fresh off
a tremendous 10-0 defeat of ‘top-
ped ranked Syracouse, could well
be down for the ball game.

But such was not the case as
the Cats’ 20-13 victory ran their
win streak to two and now stand
at 4-2-2. , a

“It was a real tough ball game,”
said Michelosen, “they were up
for usand were ﬁghting mad.
They put the pressure on us and
played a ﬁne ball game defensive-
ly,” he commented.

Someone asked the Panther
tutor if he had had any uneasy-
moments during the ball game.
Michelosen similingly reported,
“We have had quite a few uneasy
moments throughout the season.”

“We were really up for this
one,” commented Frank Minik,
Irish halfback from nearby Van-
dergrift. “I don’t think we can get
up like this again for the rest of
our games and I know we weren’t
up like this for any previous ball
games.” ‘

Panther End Mike Ditka had
this to say. “Don’t let anybody
kid you about Notre Dame. They
were as tough as any ball club_
we have met all year.”

He continued, “They hit harder
than the teams we’ve played and

that 1-6 record is no indication

of the team that we played out"

there.” He concluded, “I'm, glad
we got past them with a victory.”
Ditka, while praising Notre
Dame, was one of the reasons the
Cats ’were able to win. The all-
American end played a great
game both offensively and defen-
sively.

The Panther cross-country teamé
put the icing on a stale cake,
"when they dropped their ﬁnal
meet of the season with NYU, 25-
32. The Violets became the sixth
team to humble the Cats this
year, as 25-year old Joe Dougan,
a veteran‘ Irish runner, streaked
in the winning time of

land course.

Sophomore Harry Stokes trail-
ed by 18 seconds, ﬁnishing sec-
ond. “I thought he might have
won it,” commented Coach Carl
Rees, “but he was afraid to pass
Dougan. He stayed right with him
for the ﬁrst three or four miles.”

The order of runners ﬁnishing
the race was unique as each team
claimed every other runner for
the ﬁrst nine positions. The dif-
ference was that NYU had the
ﬁrst runner and also the 10th and
11th places.

Co-captains Reed Clarke and
Bill Hinchbergér finally ran ,

close to par as they ﬁnished
fourth and sixth respectively.
“I was r e al pleased with
Clarke,” said Rees. “Hinchberg-
er caught three men at the last
quartermile.”

Bob Tarkany ran a poor race to
ﬁnish eighth, “He ran a slow pace

at the start and ﬁnished real—

strong, but it was too late,” Rees
stated. John Hart ﬁnished 12th;
Vance Carter, 13th; John Towne,
15th and Don Adams, 17th.

The frosh team capped a suc-
cessful 3-1 year with a 23-36
win over arch-rival West Vir-
ginia at" Schenley Park. Bill
Mocnik completed an undefeat-
ed yearling season as he was
timed in 13:46.

West Virginia claimed the next
two runners, but the Cubs pluck-
ed off the next three. Steve Waslo
was 4th; Larry Robinson, 5th; Bob
Henry, 6th; A. J. Rice, 7th; Dick
Cook, 9th, and Bill Taylor, 10th.

The mud handicapped both

sent the game into overtime with
a third period goal._

After two hard fought over-
time periods, the score was still
deadlocked at 1-1. Although the
Panthers had outplayed West
Chester, they still came out with
only a tie.

“We out played them and
should have won,” said Coach
Bemis. “We outshot them but just
couldn’t get that winning goal
across the line. It’s been our
trouble all year when we meet a

Although the Panthers went out

PANTHER HALFBACK Chuckkeinhold relaxes after a hard days

 
 

   

work which includes studying for the ministry and practicing
football. Reinhold, after a slow start this year, has come on to
be one of the Panther’s best defensive backs. ‘ He is a senior.

 Reinhold Shines As Defensive
 Back, Stars Against Orange

By JACK SMITH
They call him bird legs because; his legs are so thin. At
175 pounds he is one of the Panther’s lightest men. But play-
ers and coaches alike will tell you that Chuck Reinhold is
one of Pitt’s "top men on defense. ' _
When Reinhold came to the University, Coach Michel-
osen expected_ him to be one of the Panthers all-time greats

on defense. As a sophomore Rein-P

hold had an outstanding year.
Last year a shoulder injury reduc-
ed his effectiveness.

And, after a slow start this«sea-
son, Reinhold came on strong,
having his most outstanding per-
formance in the Panthers 10-0 up-
set win over Syracuse.

Mt. Lebanon ‘Grad

A graduate of Mt. Lebanon
High School where he lettered in
football, basketball, baseball and
track, Reinhold is able to hold his

 own in almost every sport.

For three years running he
has been Interfraternity Wrest-
ling Champion in the 1'77-pound
division. .

His other activities include
membership in Sigma Chi Frater-

nity, Panther Club, for Varsity.

letter winner, and Inter-Varsity
Christian Fellowship.
Accepts Cat Offer

There were several reasons be-
hind his accepting the Panthers
football offer. Althoughvhe would
be able to live away from home
he would be close enough to con-
tinue his active participation in

‘ church work.

   
   

He could take courses at the
University that would lead him
to his future vocation, the min-
istry. Chuck is now a senior in
the school of Liberal Arts and
is majoring in history.

For the past two summers Rein-
hold has worked in his church’s

"Can Take Bumps

On and off the ﬁeld Reinhold

conducts himself according to his
Christian principles. But don’t let
that fool you, Chuck is not soft,

., he can take his bumps with the

rest of the team.

He gained 124 yards in 18 car-
ries as a sophomore for 6.8
yards a try. Despite an injury
last year he gained 4.2 yards a

carry. This year it was appar-
ent that Reinhold still favored
his injured shoulder. His de-
fense was not up to his‘ sopho-
more performance.

“He seems to have discovered
and corrected his weaknesses,”
Coach Michelosen said.‘ “We ‘look
for Reinhold to be a standout
throughout the remaining games.”

‘fit was a great feeling being a
part of‘ the team victory over
Syracuse,” Reinhold said; “Now,
I just want us to win the rest of
our games and do what I can to
be a part of the wins.”

Chances are he will if he
doesn’t get his bell rung. In foot-
ball language that is being knock-
ed unconscious.

It happened to Chuck in the
spring practice game this year and
he couldn’t remember if he was
still going with his girl: After 24
hours in the hospital his memory
came back just the way he has
done this season. ‘A

Reinhold has to be considered a
factor in the Panthers recent
surge to‘ a winning season.

and John Gregg snared the other.‘

John Rein started the scoringi
for the plebes. After Bob Ernest
caught Ray Conway in the end-
zone for a safety and then scored
himself it looked like a runaway.

The Panther Cubs came back =

" strong in the third period with t

Martha throwing a‘ three—yard
pass to Leeson to start the scor-
ing. Following the kickoff Navy
started to pass but Leeson picked
one off to set up the next TD.
Martha slithered 25-yards down

bring the score up to .16‘-14 as
the quarter came to an end.
The Cubs crossed the goal l_ine

twice more to rap the game up be--

After a drive of 68 yards Mar-

out the scoring for the afternoon
for the Cubs Martha had another
hand in the glory pie. He tossed
an eight yard bullet to John Gregg
for the insurance tally.

the season and the improvement
of the boys. “When, I ﬁrst saw

In Cecconi’s three years
freshmen coach he has never had
a winning season until this year.
But this year his charges came
through with an undefeated year
and extended the frosh unbeaten
string to seven games.

Joanne “Spcedy" Dolinar and
Ed Fornadel both had 10-5
cards. Speedy has come along
strong in the last few weeks
to make a bid for the champion-
ship. Jack (Scoop) Smith had
his poorest week with a 9-6
slate. Smith had a rest before
hitting the home stretch drive.
Ted Colton and Marshall
Romeo both had 8-7 records
which were below their abilities.
Consensus had a poor week los-
ing all the upsets and predicting,
some ties that failed to come
about. His slate showed only sev-
en wins and eight losses.

' maybe, this airplane has one thing
in common with the first war-
gallcys of ancient Egypt.—..and --
with the air and space vehicles of
the future. Someone must chart its
course. Someone must navigate it.

For certain young men this pre-
sents a career of real executive
opportunity. Here, perhaps you
will have the chance to master a
profession full of meaning, excite-
ment and rewards. . . as a Naviga-
tor in the U. S. Air Force.

To qualify for Nzwigator train-
ing as an Aviation Cadet you must
be an American citizen between 19
and, 26%-single, healthy and in-
telligent. A high school diploma is’
required, but some college is highly
desirable. Successful completion of
the training program leads to a
commission as a Second Lieuten-
ant . . . and your Navigator wings.
