As the problem of choosing a
president for next year approaches
a settlement, SFA will ﬁnd itself
with a -new worry tomorrow night
when Independents will bring up
the question of the constitutionality
of the appointments made by the
old and new executive committees
two weeks ago.

Since it has been deﬁnitely estab-
lished that all seven faculty mem-
bers will be present tomorrow
night, and that all but the deanof
men and dean of women will prob-
ably’ vote, chances are that the as-
sembly can move on to new busi-
ness after choosing the new leader.

I As the ﬁrst thing for the as-
sembly to consider, the Independ-
ents will ask that some one pass on
the legality of the present appoint-
tees' right to hold their offiices.

The Independent case will be has-

BBLUESTON E and

. ed ‘completely on the constitution
' of SFA.

First of all under.article VIII,
Section 1, “Personnel of the ex-

ecutive committee; The executive‘

committee shall be composed of
‘nine persons: the Chancellor, the
Dean of Men, and the Dean of
Women, or their representatives,
and six’ students, four men and two
women, all members of the Assem-
bly.”
At the executive committee
meeting on April 23, not only the
new members of the committee, but

the old members, whoseterms had '

expired, were permitted to vote.
'I'hus,. instead of the six student
members allowed by the constitu-
tion, there were 12 students vot-
ing.

Fraternity men claimed that the
old members, by force of tradition,
had a right to vote. But Independ-
onts say that while this may be
true, it does not make the vote any
more legal, and when the commit-
tee was completely dominated by
fraternity men, it did not make any
difference how many votes were
cast. Under equal representation
the numbers were important.

Furthermore, In d e p e n d e n t s
claim, the constitution explicitly
limits the personnel of the commit-
‘tee to students who are “all mem-
bers of the_assembly.” And they
say the graduating seniors of the
old committee could not be consid-

, ered “members of the assembly.”

On these bases, the Independ-
ents will attempt to have all ap-
pointments made by the commit-
tee declared void. '

Fraternity leaders. will probably
Klefend the committee's personnel
and selections on the grounds of
tradition and courtesy. They will
contend that an established prac-
tice cannot be abruptly declared il-
"legal because of an amendment
which does not even mention’ the
executive committee. '

Pitt Band    
Race.”Query
Continues  

The committee to study the policy
of the Pitt_ band with regardto the
admission of colored students met

for the ﬁrst time Monday after-,

110011.

Under the chairmanship of Dr.
Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of the
school of Business Administration,
the committee held its initial ses-
sions, interviewing Irwin Rosen,
Pitt News editor, and Charles Rick-
mond, BA44, who was denied ad-
mission to the band last fall on the
grounds that he was a Negro.

The committee continued inter-
views throughout yesterday, and

will probably meet this afternoon .

and tomorrow. Just how long the
committee will continue to hold
sessions was not decided late Mon-
day afternoon, but, according to
chairman Lanfear, the group will
meet “until all who ‘can throw some
light on the case have been heard.”
When the committee reaches its
decision, an oﬂicial ‘announcement
will be made. Until that time, by
decision of the group, all interviews
and discussions are being kept con-
ﬁdential, pending the formulation
of the ﬁnal decision of the com-
mittee. ~
If the committee reaches a de-
cision before the-Pitt News dead-
line Wednesday, it will appear in
Friday’s paper.

For Air Raid

Protection

B1 AL MAVRINAC

The ﬁrst details of the progra_m
of air-raid protection outlined in
Monday’sNews were announced to-

it day; by Dr. John J. Geise, Univer-

sity air-raid warden.
_ As reported Monday the basis
of the plan is the classroom itself.
The instructor in the classroom at
the sounding of the alarm will as-

sume his duties as class warden. '

He will be empowered to act in
any way he sees ﬁt in the protec-
tion of those under his authority.

The ﬁrst duty of the classroom
warden will be that of assembling
members of the Elass in the “raid
areas” which will be assigned each
class later in the week.

Each floor of the Cathedral used
for‘ raid protection will be in
charge of a floor captain with floor
wardens serving under him.

Certain ﬂoors are necessarily un-
suited for protection.

Carroll Reynolds, member of the
University library staff,’ has been
appointed ﬂoor ‘warden for the ﬁrst
ﬂoor. _ A

Assisting him are J’. R. Bickley
instructor in modern languages; J.
J . Blair, assistant professor of eco-
nomics; W. G. Crouch, assistant
professor of English; F. E. Cur-

tis, associate professor of English;
A. G. Dietze, assistant professor of '

psychology; W. H. Ford, instructor

I in English; D. B. Rogers, associate

professor of sociology; B. H. Wil-

- liams, professor of political science;

J. Stinchcomb, professor and head
of the department of classics; and
B. Whitehill, assistant professor of
English. ,

In the event that any of these
men are in class when an air alert
sounds, they will ﬁrst see that the
members of the class are quartered

' in the raid areas, then report to

their ﬂoor captain for instruction.
One member of the class will be
left in charge of the group during
continued on page four

This ‘problem "will be solved‘

T 1 ing. ‘»

Editor, the Pitt News:
In reference to your editorial of
Monday, May 4, I fail to see by

what authority you have set your- ’

self up as an adviser to the Dean of
-Men’s office. In the long history of

the University of Pittsburgh band-

this question has undoubtedly come
_up before.

When this question came up it
was quietly solved without drag-
ging names across" the editorial
sheets. Thus it caused no unrest
among the student body or embar-
rassment to the persons involved.

If you do not believe that this
problem was solved fairly, (accord-
ing to your own standards of right
and wrong) how ‘do you expect
Dean Lanfear to solve it according
to your present standards.

Dean Lanfear as, as you recall,
was dean. of men for a number of
years. During that time this issue
surely arose and he solved it ac-

_ cording to his honest standards.
, These standards are the standards
of the student body, not the warped

 etters r

   

again according to the correct
ideals by which all problems at
Pitt have been, in the past, solved,
are solved, and will be solved with-
out crusade-crazed editors drag-
ging these situations and the people
involved through rabble-rousing
editorial mud, only intended to

bring attentionuto the editor him-
self-

 

HERB NICHOLAS, C44

Editor’s Note: _
Let Reader Nicholas be advised
of the Pitt News’ policy on edito-
rials. The News is a student news-
paper. lts editorials are the opin-
ion of the 'editors..It is the opinion
of_the editors that it is wrong to
keep a man out of the band because
he is .a ‘Negro. .
The Pitt News is also a vehicle

for the expression of student opin- ‘

ion,» whether or_ not such opin-ion
coincides‘ with that pot the editor,
viz.,‘ ‘the’ above letter. A I
The News will continue to offer
critical judgment on University af-
‘ fairs, as they come up. It will ex-
press ’an' opinion of University
news whether the source of such

news be the faculty, the adminis-
tration, or the students themselves.
an ac =1: .

ll‘ Reader Nicholas will check up

on Pitt band history he will ﬁnd

that Negroes have been in the band

in the past. The race issue has

never come up before this year.

That's why no one was embarrass-

ed. Or was dragged through the
editorial mud.

This year, however, a student
was kept out of the band because
he is a Negro. And the editors of
Pitt News believe that musical
ability, and not race, must be the
deciding factor for membership in
the Pitt band. If the expression of
that belief embarrasses certain
people, it embarrasses certain peo-
ple. M . ' .

’ And,‘ along with Reader Nich-

olas, we believe that the problem

is well on its way to being solved‘.

A fair-minded committee is con-

sidering the‘ matter, and we feel

sure that these men will‘ reach an
. honest, unprejudiced, fair. decision.
= And hdnest, ~ Reader Nicholas,
we’re not crusade-crazed. We’d look
like hell on aiwhite horse.

“The time has come,” the walrus
said, “to talk of many things” of"
ships and Jeeves and Johns and
cabbages and Patterson. It tears at
our heartstrings to leave. Think of
the fun we have had, what with the

 Kappas presenting" a doghouse and

. the Delts presenting nothing, Nich-
olas,_ McClure and others present- -

‘ ing pins and Egan just presenting.

After all, we have seen so much
happen to so many‘ people that
leaving now with so many things
just beginning is more than we can
,stand——sob,er. One of the things
that's just beginning is a little ro-‘
mance between pretty Peggy
‘Johns and Dave “The Dutchman”
Updegraff (Ohio State publications
please copy). ' .
Think.of what could be done with
this! Johnny writes “Holland” on
her books because she is afraid that
Jeeves “PW” Masquelier will catch
wise if she writes “The Dutchman.”
If Jeeves doesn’t know now, he is’
a slower thinker than he looks.

rying‘ ‘for; fear his real romance
might be exposed. Don't worry
Bob, everyone knows.

All year long we have wondered
why Jack Stauﬁ looked so poetic.
Now we know. According to the
graduation programme‘ his middle
name is .Byron, which to us seems
eminently’ appropriate. Jim Glas-
gow hasstarted playing dive bomb-

er in the Panther oﬂice. ‘ ~~

George Chirgos is also “PW."
But then again aren't we all? ‘Look
at Bob Stodgle, he went and pinned
Betty Jane Hendrickson. Well, well,
it's been a great. year and much
has happened that should live on
in some people’s memories. Other
things have happened that will just
live on.

Maxine Coffman astounded Slee-
py Lee McFadden and, a lot of oth-

still some chance that Loustenpo-f-

Adventure seems to follow Boyd
(Buzz) Wagner. ,

~ Perhaps it is Wagner who fol-

lows adventure.

This former Pitt student who
was named the first American ace
of this war, has three more Jap
planes to his credit. Just what that
makes his total, we do not know.
They have stopped counting his
successes.

This recent triﬂe victory was

added on a ﬂight when-Buzz was '

along just for the ride. He was to
accompany some American ﬂiers
just to see how the boys behaved.
But the war ace turne_d the tables

and showed the boys a few things
about ﬂying-—and ﬁghting.

The battles which Wagner de-
scribed later as “the best dogﬁght
I ever saw” followed an attack by
American and Australian planes on
Japanese bases in New Guinea. The
planes were reforming to return
home when they were attacked by
a dozen Japanese Zero ﬁghters. ”

lt did not take more than live
seconds. Every Japanese plane was
hit, but there is no way of know-'
ing how many were destroyed. And
Lieut. Col. .Wagner had three more
good reasons for beingcalled an
American war ace to add to his
splendid record.

VVagner attended the University
of Pittsburgh for three years but
quit to enlist as a “flying cadet.”

I For Once-Beaten Pitt Team

Pitt’s varsity tennis men, like
their baseball brethren, are on the
road to their-best mark in years.
After starting off the current sea-
son with losses, both outﬁts have
swung back onto the straight and
narrow by taking their next four
encounters.

The net team, accompanied by
Coach Doc. Hartwig, and assist-
ant Coach Al Vesper, left yester-
day for West Point to take on an
extremely tough Army outﬁt this
afternoon. Neithercoach is very
conﬁdent and they do have some-

thing to moan about for it has been..

_- learned that number four man Bob
Nickeson is unable to travel with
 the team. .
‘Nickeson is a second-year stu-
_ dent in the School of Medicine, and
7  he has decided that’ a three-
" ' day trip would make him miss too
many classes. He also failed to
make the trip to Indiana last Sat-
urday.
Taking over Nickeson's spot on
the traveling squad is Jack Wynn,
’ with Jimmy Deutelbaum moving in-
 1:6 number’ five, and _,,B'i:ibby Gaylen
I playing number six.

The initial three men will, how-
ever, remain in their original spots.
This combination will show, Dick

'7 ".Trimble playing number one, Hen-
_’ry ‘Grance in two, and Bill Reese
in three.

 The. doubles combinations have
_-_'Trimble and Grance in the first
" match, and Reese and Wynn in the
‘ 7:second. The number three outﬁt is
[knot deﬁnite, but will probably show
'_iDeutelbaum teaming up-with eith-
er Bob Gaylen or Jack Ellis, soph-
 omore from Pittsburgh’s Central
  Catholic High.

 Meanwhile, Pitt's victory-hungry

   
   
 
  
 
 
 
 

 

golf team moves into Philadelphia
this Saturday to take on the Penn-

sylvania squad. The Panthers re-
‘ turned from a disappointing East-
ern. Inter-collegiate Golf Associa-
tion meet last weekend without a
victory, and they are anxious to
make up for lost time. .
The same team which competed
in the Association meet will show
for the Panthers. This lineup shows
Bill Kramer, Harry Simpson, Bob
Walkinshaw, Steve Bilowich, Jim
Berbore, and Dave Thurbon.

Trip Phi Delts
ln Playoff Tilt

AE &, ME Frosh and Sophstook
the first leg.of the Intramural
mushball league by sweeping Phi
Delta Theta 16-1, last Monday at
Trees ﬁeld.

Big gun for the Engineers was
Romeo Moschetti, freshman from
Creensburg. Besides pitching him-
self a four-hit game, Moschetti led
this mates in the hitting department
‘with four bingles.

Other players who made more
than two hits were Engineers Mc-
Kee and Rees, and Phi Delt “Jump-
ing Jim” Plunkett, Edgewood soph-
omore, whose play has greatly help-
ed the fraternity champs all sea-
son.

The Engineers started the game
with an eight run splurge in the
first inning. They added four in the
second, and one and three in the
two successive frames. Phi Delta
had to be content with one run in
the third. The game was called at
the end of the fourth.

Today is Army Day for the
Panther baseballers who take
on the Cadet nine at West
Point, N. Y. Army is expected
to ﬁeld a strong club in all de-
partments, but Pitt's chances
have been considerably improved
by their ﬁne showing against In-
diana, VVest Virginia, and Buck-
nell.

, .
Certainly, the success of the
baseball team thus far has been a

surprise to even its staunchest

rooters. Mitterling started ‘out this
season with only two regulars from
last season and a group of sopho-
mores, many of whom had never
played ball before. Yet it is those
very sophomores who have come
through to make the team a suc-

cess.

Bill McKee, one. of those soph-
omores, has become the ace of the
pitching staff. Although his 3 hit
perfo mance against Bucknell on
Saturday stands out as his best, he
also turned in a five -h-it job against
Indiana, and did some creditable
relief work in the ﬁrst Bucknell
game, and in the West Virginia
game.

One of Mitterling’s magic touch-
es occurred last week when Basket-
baller Jim Egan pitched and.won
the second game with West Vir-
ginia. It seems that Egan was up at
the Stadium one day idly throwing
a few balls to one of the catchers
when his curve ball attracted Mit-
terling’s attention. The Panther
mentor told him to get himself a

uniform and come out for baseball ‘
practice. One week later he was a.

starting pitcher.

,

The Panthers come home Thurs-
day night and on Saturday they
meet Ohio University at the Sta-
dium for their next to last home
game this season. Ohio University
has one of the ﬁnest college base-
ball teams in the East and at pres-
ent they are sporting a record of
eight wins and no losses.

5‘ .Annual Intramural Mushball Selections

By placing ﬁve men on the ﬁrst
team, the fraternities have once
again dominated the Pitt News all-
Intramural squad for the third con-
secutive year. The Independents
ﬁlled three positions while the Eu-

S gineers managed to take the only
other spot on the select mythical
, team.

- Inter-Fraternity champs Phi Del-
ta,Theta and Pi Kappa Alpha were
the only two houses that were able
to cop more than one spot on the
first team with two each.

The all-Intramural nine which_
was selected this year by a poll of
all the mushball umpires, was cap-

‘tained by Stan Valenski, burly
__ ’ Phi Delt ﬁrst baseman. Valenski, a
freshman, was one of the mainstays
of the Phi Delt aggregation and it
was largely through his consistent
play that the Dithridge St.,lads
w_-_ere_able to cop the title. ’

l(ise behind Valenski in the
ii-uinber of votes polled was Romeo
Miachetti, ace hurler for the Den-
tal Frosh. Another freshman,‘ Mi-

New Officers Elected
By Kappa Phi Kappa

At a recent meeting of Kappa
Phi Kappa, honorary education
fraternity, Harold Byers, 43, was,
elected president; Harold Gondel-’
 * H, _ "Paul

 
  
   

 
  

throughout the entire campaign
and successfully led his team
through one of the closest Inde-
pendent scrambles in the history of
the school.

At the catching post on this sea-
son’s team is Gus Wilde. Wilde, a
PiKA, was one of the, best de-
fensive_ catchers in any circuit and
his big bat paved the way for many
of the triumphs of his house.

Rounding out the rest of the in-
field are Loren Braner, Phi Delt, at
the keystone position; Dick Fair,

another Pi Kappa Alpha, at short-
stop, and Herby Me-Gibbney, of the
A.C., at the hot corner.

For his outstanding defensive
play and his timely base clouts at
the plate, little Davey Thurbon was
awarded the centerﬁeld post. Thur-
bon was one of the few bright
spots on an otherwise disastrous
season for the Phi Cams.
‘Teaming with Thurbon in the

outﬁeld are Irv Josephs, Dental
Frosh star, and Bill Clark of the
A.C. aggregation.

Track Succes

Coach Carl Ols'on’s track team
will aim for his ﬁrst outdoor suc-
cess of the season next Saturday
when the Nittany Lions from Penn
State invade the local stronghold
at the stadium.

Unlike other years, the Panthers
this
nothing more than a prayer. A
weak prayer at that. The Blue and
Elliott,
Cooper, and Norton‘ through the
draft, thus making the locals a bit
battered and crippled for the on-
coming battle. ‘

The Lions will arrive with a
strong squad consisting of Gordon,
Ewell, Peters, Goﬁ"berg, Plesser,
and Bakura. Their strength will
rest mainly on their distance men,
the half-milers, milers, and two-
milers; the dashes are rather even-
ly distributed with ‘Carter and
Ewell making for equality. Pitt
should have an edge in the relays,
and the Lions a shade better in all
the ﬁeld, events. V

Last week the State“ men had an
easy time winning over the Spar-
tans from Michigan State, and are

expected to be ripe for reveng"§. In
last year’s dual meet the Panthers
traveled to State College and nosed
out their hosts to keep their vic-
tory string intact.

The celebrated duel between
Pitt's Bill Carter and State’s Ewell
should be treat enough for the lo-
cal fans. Both boys are capable of
turning in record breaking times
in either the 100-yard dash or the
220, and the rivalry between the
two boys is intensely keen.

“Hap” Stickel will have to put

Economist,

Dies at 50

Abraham Epstein, America’s
leading advocate of sound social se-
curity, outstanding critic of “crack-
pot schemes,” and a Pitt graduate

‘ of the class of 1917, died Saturday

after a week's illness, in New York
city's Polyclinic hospital. His age
was 50.

Among his positions were those
of executive secretary of the
American Association for Social
Security, lecturer on social insur-
ance at New York University and
Brooklyn college, and consulting
economist for the Social Security
Board.

Born in Russia of Russian par-
ents, Mr. Epstein came to this
country in 1910 and was natural-
ized in 1917, the same year that he
received his Bachelor of Science de-
gree from the University’s school
of business administration. In
1918 he completed a post-graduate
course at Pitt, and he studied at
Columbia university from 1929 to
1931.

In 1918 he became director of re-
search for the Pennsylvania Com-
mission on Old Age Pensions, and
remained a director of several old
age commissions for seven years.

While at Pitt, he became a. close
friend of Dr. Francis D. Tyson,
professor of economics, and every
year came back to the University
to speak to Dr. Tyson's classes. His
last visit was on March 13 of this
year.

Mr. Epstein was to receive an
honorary Doctor_ of Philosophy de-
gree from Pitt this summer.

He organized the American as-
sociation for Old Age Security in
1927, and had been executive sec-
retary ever since. He was editor of
ﬁle Association’s official publica-

tion, “Social Security," and con-

tributed articles on social and la-
bor questions to American Mer-
oury, Harpers, the Forum, the Na-
tion, and other publications.

Until his death, Mr. Epstein
sought for reforms in the unem-
ployment program, which he re-
garded as the greatest gap in the
entire ﬁeld of social security.

Newstetter and Wilson
Attend Conference

Dr. W. I. Newstetter, dean of the
school of applied social sciences,
and Gertrude Wilson, professor of
group work, will attend the Nation-
at Conference of Social Work in
New Orleans, May 10 to 16.

Dr. Newsletter and Miss Wilson
will read papers at the conference.
Dr. Newstetter is also chairman of
the social group work section
which will discuss “Human Prob-
lems and Social Group Work."

The South Side, Pittsburgh dis-
trict. will be one of the communi-

vties to be studied by the social work-

ers when the conference meets.

At the present time Dr. New-
stetter is attending the Canadian
Conference on Social Work at Mon-
treal.
