UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Ferraro addresses
Pitt Democrats

By Jenifer Crook
Staff Writer

The controversy over
abortion rights is the key issue
that will return American
political power to the
Democrats in 1992, according
to former Vice-Presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro.

“I strongly feel that what’s
happened over the past five or
six months has been an
incredible turning of political
events in this country. Women
are finally waking up to the
fact that their right to a legal
abortion is being seriously
threatened,” Ferraro said in an
informal discussion sponsored
by the College Young
Democrats in the Cathedral of
Learning Tuesday afternoon.

In order to change political
tides from one party to another,
Ferraro said that it usually takes
a big controversy to bond voters
together.

“We can only hope
Americans will mobilize if they
care enough about something.
In the ‘60s it was Vietnam, in

Ethe ‘70s it was Watergate, and
hopefully ‘in 1992 it will be
abortion,” she said.

Ferraro said that in the 1984
presidential election, in which
she unsuccessfully ran with
Walter Mondale, voters
concentrated too much on the
personal image of the
candidates while ignoring their
stances on real concerns, such
as the future of abortion rights.

“Nobody cared about those
issues. But Reagan fulfilled the
Democratic Party’s worst
prophecy by appointing three

conservatives to the Supreme
Court,” she said, adding that
those appointments have
made feasible the overturning
of Roe vs. Wade.

Ferraro said that she
realized how damaging
abortion restrictions could be
while working as a district
attorney in Queens, New York
at the beginning of her career.

‘‘I’m not pro-abortion; I’m
pro—choice,” she said. “I’ve
seen too many babies who
are the victims of homicide
and child abuse. You can
force somebody to have a
child, but you can’t force
somebody to love one.”

Another aspect of abortion
that will work in favor of the
Democrats, Ferraro added, is
President Bush’s failure to
keep his pledge supporting
abortions for incest and rape
victims. '

“People will look negatively
at President Bush’s veto last
week of a bill that would
provide funding for abortions
for women who are victims
of such heinous crimes and
don’t have enough money to
get [an abortion]. Poor women
should be provided equal
protection under the "law. I
think it’s going to come back
to haunt him,” she said.

Ferraro said that in order to
win more elections,
Democrats should not
become more conservative
to appeal to Republican
voters, a trend that she sees
occurring often.

Soviet and American feminists

Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro speaks on women's issues at the Syria
Mosque yesterday.

By Erik Kridle
Asst. News Editor

Though American women have

i finally been admitted to the “power

banquet” previously reserved for only

male diners, “they are only being

served half of the meal,” according

to Geraldine Ferraro at a Chautauqua
appearance yesterday.

Ferraro, the former democratic
vice-presidential candidate, joined
actress Marlo Thomas and Soviet
Women’s committee chairwoman
Alevtina Fedulova yesterday morning
at the Syria Mosque, comprising a
panel to discuss the role of women
in contemporary U.S. and Soviet
societies.

Ferraro said that until there are
more women making the
“ultimate decisions” in American
government, the role of women

will not dramatically improve. ‘

Ferraro added that though she
personally felt that the United
States was ready for a female
president in 1984, the likelihood
of a woman becoming president
will continue to remain low until
there is an increase in the number
of women state governors and
senators, from ~ whose ranks
presidents are traditionally
chosen.

In contrast, Fedulova said that
approximately 20 percent of the
chief Soviet legislative body is

comprised of women.
However, Soviet women have
a long way to go before they
are socially equal and receive
the same financial
compensation for jobs also
held by men, she added.

Fedulova said thatalthough
60 percent of the physicians
in the Soviet Union are
women, it wasn’t always that
way. Women began to’ fill
many medical positions
vacated by men who began‘
leaving the profession after
the Soviet government
decided to lower physician’s
salaries. _

Dialogue gives opportunity to discuss culture with Soviet students

By Jim Tezak
.sst. News Editor

Faculty members from two
Soviet universities fielded
questions from Pitt students
yesterday morning at “Students
For Glasnost: A Dialogue on U.S.-
Soviet Relations.”

Soviets present included Maria
Mamonova and Mikhail Boykov
from Moscow State University
and Gregory Badirian, Pavel
Shetko and Anna llyushkina from
the Moscow Highway
Construction Institute.

They responded to questions
from the audience and a panel of
eight Pitt students representing
the College Young Democrats,
ghe College Republicans and the

.3 Sigma Alpha political~science
ggnor society, the three university

0 organizations that sponsored the

event as part of the Chautauqua

at Pitt conference.

The Soviets all said that they
had no misconceptions about the

“lt’s better to see than to read.
the only obvious
difference,” Mamonova said.

said Mikhail
Gorbachev’s perestroika program
has been very popular among

That is

The Soviets

Soviet citizens.

“Perestroika is gaining strength
in the Soviet Union,” Badirian
said. “But remember, what the
United States has accomplished
in 200 years, the Soviet Union has
tried to accomplish in three.”

The Soviets spoke 1:) the
audience about enrollment at
Soviet universities. Competition
to get into college is fierce,

depending on what a student
wants to study.

“For some of them, it’s very
difficult to enter,” Mamonova said.
She also mentioned that one of
the toughest disciplines to get
accepted into is acting.

“They have tremendous
competition. It’s unbelievable,”
she said.

According to Mamonova, there
will also be discussions in
November over possibilities that
Soviet youths who attend a
university will be more free to
choose whether or not to serve in
the military.

Boykov said that the main
economic problems faced by
Gorbachev’s government are the
appropriation of individual
ownership of property, whether
one man can employ another
and the issue of cooperatives,

where a factory would be owned
by all of the factory workers.

“Soviet economy is not
becoming capitalistic; it’s
becoming more socialistic,” said
Edward Yurkovetsky, a Pitt
student with dual citizenship in
the Soviet Union and the United
States, who served as an
interpreter.

According to Ilyushkina, there
is an older generation in the
Soviet Union who associate the
victory over Nazi Germany in
World War II with Stalin, but the
current government is now
spreading anti-Stalin propaganda.

The panel also addressed
several questions about Soviet
foreign policy.

Boykov, who served as a soldier
during the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan, said that the Soviet
Union has not taken an official

stand on the present situation in
China because of lessons learned
in Afghanistan.

“Afghanistan taught me to
respect international law and
other nations’ laws,” he said. "I
basically consider [the invasion]
a crime of the government. For
the first several years of the war
in Afghanistan, people in the
Soviet Union did not know about
the war.

“I do not consider myself a
killer; I consider myself a soldier.
Iinever killed civilians. I killed
other soldiers who were armed."

Boykov was reluctant to
compare Afghanistan with the
Unites States’ involvement in
Vietnam.

He said, “There are significant
differences. The soldiers are the
same; the wars were different.”

Women strive for equality in both U.S. and U.S.S.R.

Byjennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

A desire to expand and continue a
women’s movement that has already begun
in the homelands of both superpowers
was expressed as Soviet and American
women spoke on work and family issues
at one of T uesday’s Chautauqua sessions.

“Women are now speaking out about
the problems that face us. Next the task is
to change the conscience of men on the
whole complex of these matters,” said
Galina Semenova, U.S.S.R. people’s deputy
and chief editor of Krestyanlea magazine.

Semenova focused her 1O4minute speech
on the new dual nature of a woman’s role
in family and the workplace. A

“Glasnost not only discovered a complex
situation but also determined ways of

overcoming it, of overcoming these
contradictions. The first of these is to
overcome the stereotypes that surround
women,” Semenova said.

Joining Semenova from the Soviet Union
was Alevtina Fedulaova. Two American
women also sat on the panel, which was
moderated by Letty Cotin Pogrebin, editor-
at-large of Ms. magazine.

“What we’re looking at on this panel are
not just the situations in the two different
places, but the attitudes. T hat’s what is
important,” Pogrebin said. .

When Alexis Herman, chief of staff of
the Democratic national committee spoke,
she shared some personal experiences
with the audience. I

“I am a child of a single-parent mother,
of a young African-American teenage
mother who awakened early . in the

mornings to prepare breakfast and dinner
before she departed for work and I
departed for school; who worked in the
evening to finish high school and then
college. It never occurred to me that I
wouldn’t work. It was just a given,” I lerman
said.

Herman also discussed the similarities
between Soviet and American women.

“Unfortunately, women in this country,
asin your country, are still the ones who
bear the burden of making the balance
between home and work,” Herman said.

Dana Friedman, founder ofthe Families
and Work Institute, focused her speech on
the changes that companies are making in
response to the needs of families in
America.

“Companies today are interested in
conforming to family needs, not because

3

they think it is a good thing to do, but
because it makes good business sense,”
Friedman said.

Friedman writes a monthly column for
Working Woman magazine called “The
Juggling Act.” "

“You hear this term ‘family man’ a lot
but you never hear anyone say ‘family
woman’. No wonder —— the term is
redundant,” Friedman said.

The session concluded with an audience
question—and-answer session and one of
the panelists expressed a desire for more
forums between women to discuss their
progress at home and in the workplace.

“My vision for the next 50 years is that
we will come together again to speak
about women as both moms and managers,
as both nurturers and nation builders,”
llerman said.

When and if the number of women in American government increases, Ferraro

Cooperation essential to solving ecological problems

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

The history of world pollution
problems was recounted and
solutions proposed at the
“Cooperation in Solving Global

Problems” plenary session
yesterday afternoon.
Boris N. Laskorin, deputy

director of the All—Union Scientific
Research Institute of Chemical
Technology, talked mainly about
our planet’s water and its
contamination.

“The world’s drinking-water
supply is in constant contact with
heavy metals and toxic
chemicals,” Laskorin said. “Algae
formation is growing all over the
world.”

Laskorin noted the increased
pollution of our oceans. “There

’. has been a steady inﬂux of

petroleum into the oceans,” he
said. “We have to join efforts to

further clean the ocean floor.”
He also pointed to possible
energy sources in the future.
“Nuclear stations are now
operating successfully
all over the world,” he
said. He went on to say 66
that although it is
important to avoid
accidents like Chernobyl
and Three Mile Island,
nuclear power is much
easier to use.
Laskorin gave a

also set goals for

“For those who wish to be

see which country can contribute
most to cleaning up the world.
Let’s see who can set the highest

Algirdas Y. Maniushis, director
of the Scientific Institute,

management and information,
concentrated on the exploitation
of our natural resources. “One
country could not possibly hope
to single—handedly solve all of
the problems we face,” he said.

“International cooperation is
absolutely essential.”
Maniushis discussed the

growing public interest in the
subject. “There is growing public
sentiment for the protection of
the environment,” he said. “The
public is taking control over the
protection of our ecology.”

When asked what we should
do to clean up our own country,
Hecht replied, “We must set an
example for the rest of the world.
But we also must look at possible
sacrifices in the future.” He used
modes of transportation as an
example, adding that some
people will have to look at
carpooling and other means to
get to work.

Journalists don't expect
‘instant partnership’

 

By Jenifer Crook
Staff Writer

Although the hostility between
the Soviet Union and United States
has eased in recent years, a panel
of Soviet and American experts
warned the public not to get their
hopes too high for an instant
partnership between the nations.

“I don’t see the guards between
our countries completely
dropping any time soon. I think
it will take two or three
generations before we are truly
partners,” said Vladimir Pozner, a
Soviet political observer and
journalist.

Panelist Felicity Barringer, a
New York: Times correspondent
previously based in Moscow,
agreed. A

I “It will probably take that long,
but that's not necessarily a bad
thing,” she said. “As we look for
areas of partnership, I think that
it’s important that we keep Our
differences in mind.”

An assistant professor from
Moscow State University, Yelena
Lukyanova, said the reason
partnership will take some time
is because people’s opinions do
not change overnight.

“Take journalists for example,”

' she said. “All their lives they’ve

been taught to be extremely

critical of the other nation. Now, «

just like that, they’re supposed to
look at them in a different light as
partners. I think that is the real
problem.”

The workshop, titled “How we
view each other: Are the images
changing from Enemy to Partner?”

A was held Monday afternoon in

the Syria Mosque banquet room
as one of the Chautauqua at Pitt
events. Panelists discussed the

roots of the hostility between the ,

Soviet Union and United States in
the past 70 years, how those
tensions have eased some since

perestroika, and what Soviets and —

Americans can do to further
improve their relations.

Leonid Dobrokhotov, a
member of the Soviet Communist
Party’s Central Committee, said
that negative propaganda used
by both governments has helped
build the “enemy” image, and
will make it harder for the
countries to develop a solid
friendship.

“In the Soviet Union, positive
changes are taking place. But our
propaganda depicting Americans
as evil will hurt ourselves, just as
[American] propaganda about
Soviets will hurt them, and our
relations with each other,” he
said. '

Most panelists cited freedom of
the press as essential before the
stereotypes Soviets and
Americans hold of each other can
fully dissolve. Pozner said that a
bill is currently being considered
by the Supreme Soviet that would
cancel government censorship in
the Soviet Union. However,
American journalist Philip
Taubman said that “The Soviet
Press still remains an instrument
of the Communist Party.”

“Reporters form public opinion,

so the press is an important
means to give more exchange
between our natmns. Just a
few years ago, Soviets thought
that Americans were hostile
when they asked so many
questions about us. But now
we realize they are just
interested and it’s good. It’s
important that we know as
much as possible about each
other through the press,” said
Lukyanova.

Dobrokhotov’ said that he
has also witnessed positive
changes in the attitudes of
American journalists.

“Now when I read American
press, I can see that you
understand us [Soviets] as

' humans instead of just the evil

empire,” he said.

Panelists also stressed the
importance of programs like
Chautauqua at Pitt to help
improve relations.

Green/oouse eﬂect discussed

By Melissa Golding
For The Pitt News

Recognizing that
environmental problems shared
by the United States and the
Soviet Union demand attention
in the economic and political
arenas, as well as environmental
agencies, representatives of
both nations discussed solutions
for the problems of global
warming and acid rain at a
workshop yesterday in the Syria
Mosque Auditorium.

U.S. moderator Edgar Berkey
opened the discussions,
replacing ‘Time magazine
corespondent Richard
Thompson, who was unable to
attend. Soviet speaker Andrey
A. Velichko, director of the
Paleography Laboratory at the
Geographical Institute of the
U.S.S.R.’s Academy of Sciences,
began the workshop by citing
the major components of the

problems of acid rain and global
warming. '

Velichko said that the Soviet
Union and the United States
provide most of the emissions
that bring harmful gases into the
atmosphere, including dioxides
that can cause radiation to remain
near Earth’s surface. Listing
changes in precipitation,
temperatures and the overall
climate, he compared the modern
atmosphere to that of the pre-
industrial period, stating that the
amount of carbon monoxide is
now 25 percent greater.

Sidney Smith, a foreign service
officer assigned by the State
Department’s Office of Soviet
Affairs to a special position at the
Environmental Protection
Agency, spoke as the U.S.
representative, emphasizing the
need for a global change and the
importance of harmony in relation
to international issues.

Soviet speaker Antoly A.

Chernoyarsky, director of the
All—Union Research Center on
Problems of Local Resources,
said, “Between 1986 and 1988,
the Soviet Union reduced the
emission of sulfur in the
atmosphere by two million tons.
In the beginning of Perestroika,
we experienced stagnation. We
[now] have programs to comply
with agreements we’ve signed.
[The problem oﬂ ecology is more
crucial or complex than the
economic problems.

“The Ecological Commission
in Soviet Parliament has
demanded larger spending on
the protection of our
environment. New agencies
formed in 1987 coordinate the
work performed. Under the old
structure, it was possible to
pollute the environment and
pay [21 small suml. There’s been
a change in the order of our
priorities.”

Pitt has tough road ahead in their bowl quest

By Geoff Moskowitz
Staff Writer

During Pitt football camp in
Johnstown, Pa., this August, head
coach Mike Gottfried and his
coaching staff decided to divide
the season into five phases. The
first two phases ended with the
Panthers at 5-0-1 and sitting in
the catbird’s seat.

The third phase ended with the
Panthers returning from South
Bend with their first defeat and a
drop of 7 points in the AP poll to
14th.

The season doesn’t get any
easier for Pitt. The Panthers’ future
opponents have a combined
record of 17-9-3 and include two
teams ranked in this week’s AP
Top 20 poll. In comparison, Pitt’s
past opponents have had a
combined record of 2255-1.

Phase four will commence
Saturday, Nov. 4, when the
Panthers host the 7th—ranked
Miami Hurricanes. Expect the
Hurricanes to storm into Pitt
Stadium at full force. Last Saturday,
Miami fell to the extremely hot
Florida State Seminoles 24-10.
The Seminoles avenged their 1988
season-opening shut-out loss to
the Hurricanes, which ended any
hopes of a national championship
for last year’s preseason top-

6 Curvin Richards, Pitt's leading rusher, and the rest of the Panthers have a tough schedule ahead of them.

Ah, Wayne Gretzky. An excellent
hockey player? Definitely. A player
able to turn around an ailing Los An geles
franchise both on the ice and ﬁnancially?
Of course. The greatest hockey player
of all-time? Maybe.

Why does Gretzky score so darn
much? Is it his skills, his quickness, his
genes? Or is it the 7

overreaction on their part. In fact, many of
the local news stations that evening, from
Pittsburgh to the Sunshine State showed
this “highlight.” After the game, Gretzky
was treated for a slight raspberry ice burn

on his arm. Ouch. 8
One may suppose that Gretzky’s teams
are merely protecting the ambassador of
hockey, one of the most

person in the entire
National Hockey
League ever touches

amazing talents to arrive
in the game in many
years. In fact, his status
has obviously earned
him a great deal of

Now I have
consistently heard
the argument that Gretzky is so quick
that he simply cannot be checked, and
that’s why he is so good. No human
being is fast enough to avoid hits from
professional hockey players for the
duration of Gretzky’s ice time. In fact,
Gretzky has been checked a few times,
and the results for his opponents have
been costly.

At one game in Calgary, when Gretzky
was driving toward the goal, Joel Otto

‘ gave him a slight push, knocking the

“Great One” to the ice. The ensuing
bench-clearing brawl by the Edmonton
Oilers seemed to be a tinge of

respect and certain rights
' that are unwritten.

However, hockey is a game of skill and
contact, and Gretzky’s game seems to be
lacking the contact part. If teams did begin
to check him and forcefully drive him off
the puck, one may see a severe decline in
the rate of his goal scoring.

If pro hockey teams are going to let a
player who is as talented as Gretzky skate
around at his leisure behind their blue
line, then they are certainly asking for
trouble.

And he will score. How do you stop him?

and real estate the NHL openly deals to

Is Gretzky the greatest?

Not  be was treated equally... but statistics reveal the story

On Sunday, Oct. 15, 1989, Los Angeles
Kings forward Wayne Gretzky became
the most prolific scorer in National Hockey
League history, surpassing Gordie Howe’s
career point total of 1,850.

The most amazing thing about Gretzky’s
accomplishment is the swiftness with
which he broke Howe’s record. Gretzky
has played in 780 NHL

0T0 break Kareem Abdul—]abbar’s
all-time NBA total of 38,387 points, a
basketball player would need to average
56 points per game for his first 686
games.

-A basketball player would need to
average 68.3 points per game for his
first 460 games to score as many points

as Wilt Chamberlain

games, only 44 percent
of the games that Howe
has played in.

This has prompted
some to ask the

 

(31,419).

-In ‘football,
a running back would
have to rush for nearly
200 yards per game

question: Is Wayne
Gretzky the greatest
scorer ever in sports history?

To put Gretzky’s accomplishment in
perspective, one needs only to compare
Gretzky’s statistics with those of some of
the greatest offensive players in other
professional sports:

-For a baseball player to hit more
home runs than Babe Ruth as fast as
Gretzky broke Howe’s record, he would
have to hit 715 homers in his first seven
years, an average of 105 per season.

-A baseball player would have to
average over 84 home runs per season in
his first nine years to break Hank Aaron’s
all-time home run mark of 755.

for his first 84 games
to break - Walter
Payton’s all—time rushing total of 16,726
yards.

Of course, these numbers are
ludicrous. What baseball player could
ever hit 105 homers in a single season,
let alone do it for seven consecutive
years?

But remember that is the equivalent
of what Gretzky has done.

Given the dramatic flair that
accompanies all of Gretzky’s feats, it
can also be debated whether Gretzky is
possibly the most exciting player ever
in sports. Gretzky seems to live a

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November 1, 1989

Mills excels both on omdoﬁft/oe tennis courts Yes

By Adam Kamras
Staff Writer

Jeff Mills, No. 2 player on the
men’s tennis team, says he wants
to prove that a letterman’s jacket
doesn’t mean 1 academic
ignorance.

His 3.7 grade point average as
a business/economics major
serves as pretty good evidence.

“Ever since I started playing
sports at a young age, I noticed
that the media classifies athletes
as ignorant,” said Mills, a junior
from Highlands High School in
Natrona Heights, Pa.

Mills said that people ‘are
surprised by his academic
achievements. These include

being named to the Big East
Academic Al1—Star Team, Athletic

Director’s Honor Roll, Dean’s List
and the Golden Key National
Honor Society. He is also a
member of the Student Judicial
Review Board and the Pre-Law
Society. ,

Practice takes up about 2 1/2
hours a day during the season,
and 90 minutes a day during the
off-season, according to Mills. He
said he often finds himself
studying in the morning and late
at night.

He admits there are times when
it becomes tough to study. He
said, “After a bad loss or a tough
three—setter, you come home tired

and sore. You have to kick it into ‘

second gear and study, no matter

how late it means staying up.”
A common problem faced by

travelling athletes is having to

miss classes for events. “I stay in
touch with my teachers at all
times and maintain a good
perspective of any upcoming
assignments,” he said.

Mills has also experienced
success on the court at Pitt. As a
sophomore, he was Pitt’s No. 1
singles player and finished second
in the Big East Tournament at
doubles. This year, he and
teammate Larry Garrard won the
consolation doubles in the
tournament.

Mills would like to see more
credit given to successful student
athletes.

“More recognition should be
placed on positive effects of
student athletes doing well in

both the classroom and the
athletic realm,” he said. “There
shouldbe more awards and media
coverage of athletes who make it
in the classroom, rather than all
of the negative effects.”

“Society is pessimistic in regard
to the human aspects of life,”
Mills said. He stated that it is
much easier to find out about
those athletes who don't succeed
academically.

Mills gives a lot of credit to his
coach, George Dieffenbach. “He
really stresses to the tennis team
about maintaining a high G.P.A.

He puts academics above
athletics,” he said.
After Mills gains his

I undergraduate degree next year,

he plans to enroll in the JD/
M.B.A. program which entails
gaining a law degree and an
M.B.A. According to Mills, it is a
four-year program which is
becoming common at many
schools.

Mills said he would then like to

politics.

charmed life; every story has a ‘T ,

happy ending for him.

In a season where Gretzky had
a multitude of distractions that
could have hampered his game,
including marriage, adjusting to
life in L.A. and the American
media, he helped the Kings
improve 21 points from the

previous year and was named
the league’s Most Valuable Player. ' A

In an ironic twist, last year’s
All-Star game was held in
Edmonton. Gretzky returned to
where he had starred for so many
years and, of course, came away
as the game’s MVP. To top off his
season of transition, Gretzky and
the Kings beat his ex-teammates
in the first round of the playoffs.

Even the way Gretzky broke '
record was A

Howe’s scoring
something more than spectacular.
Again, it was in Edmonton against
his former team that the record
fell. He wasted no time in tying
the record, getting an assist just
four minutes and 52 seconds into
the game.

Then, with only 55 seconds left
in regulation play, Gretzky broke
the record by scoring a game-

tying goal that sent the game into 
overtime. Gretzky also scored .

the game—winner in OT.

Koval leads Hockey
Club to comeback
win over Gannon in  

By Rob Codispot
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther hockey team
opened the 1989-90 season with
a come-from-behind 8-7 upset
victory over Gannon University
last Saturday at the Erie Civic
Center.

The Panthers were led
offensively by sophomore Dave
Koval who scored two goals and
assisted on two others. Bill
Krousey, a transfer from
Mercyhurst, added one goal and
two assists and Eugene Barilla
had three assists..Special teams
played a significant role in the
win as the Panthers found the net
for four power-play goals and
one short—handed.

“Our power play was very
strong,” said Eric Anderson, the

club’s vice president. “We used a »

new combination of players that
really worked well together. We

moved the puck around real well”.

Despite the plethora of power-
play goals, the Panthers’ first goal

9 of the season was of the short-

handed variety. Krousey directed
a Barilla pass into the net to give
Pitt a 1-0 lead midway through

the first period.

Minutes later, the Panthers
struck again when newcomer Rich
Skalosky netted a Dave Koval
pass for a 2-0 lead. However,
Gannon roared back, scoring the
next three goals and taking a 3-2

0 lead into the first intermission.

The Panthers converted two
of their four power plays to open
the second period scoring,
regaining the lead 4-3. Skalosky

. the wing positions.

Erie's Civic Center

and freshman Don Fedor
provided the man—advantage
goals. ‘

“Our new players [Krousey,
Skalosky and Fedor] really played
well,” Anderson said. “They were
more outstanding than the older
players. a

“Krousey was the key to the
power play,” he added. “He set
up a lot of scoring opportunities.
Skalosky and Fedor strengthen
Fedor
probably has the best shot on the
team and was also a key to the
power play.”

Gannon knotted the game at
four at the second intermission,
then erupted for three of the next
four goals to open up a 7-5 margin.
But, Pitt did not just give up.

Inspired by goaltender Mark

D-’Amico, who stopped 16 third— ,

period shots, the Panthers scored
the game’s ﬁnal three goals for
the 8-7 win.

Koval brought the Panthers
within one with his first goal of
the season on a breakaway. Then,
on ‘ his next shift, Koval came
through with his second of- the
night to pull the Panthers even.

Mark Granataira provided the
clincher, his slap shot finding the
net with just under six minutes to

play to give Pitt their first win of I

the young season.

The Panthers play Sunday,
Nov. 12, at the Golden’Mile Ice
Center in Monroeville against

‘Carnegie Mellon University.

Faceoff is at 7 p.m.

him and you have a much less
effective threat.

Mario Lemieux and Steve
Yzerman have a great deal ofskill
and mobility. However, they both
get railed every time they touch
the puck. Yet, they are still able
to score. They are not scoring
and breaking records at the
inhuman pace ofGrctzky because
they must deal, like most all other
players in the game, with a human
element, namely contact.

What would have happened if
the Rangers’ David Shaw would
have taken a woodchopper axe
swing at the Great One like he

did at Lemieux last season?
Probably mayhem in the streets,
threats on his life, etc.

By the law of averages, Gretzky
puts himself in the position for a
nice check up against the boards
several times per game. However,
opponents are not taking
advantage of this, choosing
instead to leave him alone so he
can further execute his game plan
unhindered. What would happen
if they did "hit him? They are
certainly allowed to. Last time I
looked at the rule book, checking
the man with the puck or the last
man to touch the puck is certainly
a legal action. And there is no

“except Wayne Gretzky”
amendment anywhere in there.

Certainly the Great One’s
effectiveness and goal scoring
would be greatly diminished if
the element of contact were
introduced into his game. And
the Great One may turn into the
“Pretty Good One” if this ever
happened.

I know there are a lot of pro
hockey and Gretzky fans out
there, so do yourselves a favor
and send me a letter so I can hear
your side of the coin. You will be
glad you did.

Continued from page 7
ranked team. Gino Torretta has
filled in at the quarterback
position exceptionally well for
the injured Craig Erickson. Miami
will host future Pitt opponent
East Carolina this weekend and
will have Pitt and top— ranked
Notre Dame to contend with for
the remainder of its season. The
game will be crucial for the
Panthers’ hopes of playing in a
New Year’s Day bowl. The Citrus
Bowl, among others, has
expressed interest in the Panthers.

Phase five of the Panthers’
schedule starts Nov. 18 when the
East Carolina Pirates travel to
Pittsburgh. East Carolina is not
the pushover opponent that
everyone expected in the
preseason. They will probably
travel to Pitt with a 4-3-1 record.
ECU has consistently punished
lesser opponents thisyear by a
combined total of 92 points.
However, they have not fared
well against teams such as South
Carolina and suffered a heart
breaking 2-point defeat to
Syracuse last week 18—16. Pitt
played East Carolina for the first
and only time the teams have met
in 1984, and won 17-10. Key
players on the 1989 Pirates are
kick— returner/safety Junior
Robinson and linebacker Robert
Jones.

Penn State, ranked‘16th in the
AP, shares many of Pitt’s

opponents this season. They have
decisively beaten Temple (42-3) J
and Syracuse (54-12). Pitt beat
Temple 27-3 and Syracuse 30-25.
Unfortunately for the Nittany
Lions, they must now face the
meat of their schedule. PSU will
kick off the remainder of the
season by playing 13th-ranked
West Virginia. They will also face
Notre Dame before coming to ,
Pittsburgh Nov. 25. Heisman 
Trophy candidate running back‘
Blair Thomas has returned to the
Lions’ offense.

Pitt concludes its season in
Dublin, Ireland, against the
Rutgers Scarlet Knights. Rutgers
started its season off with two ties
against Cincinnati and Ball State. (3
Since then, they have gone 2-4.
They have been a disappointment
so far this year because many
people expected them to compete
for a Top 20 spot by the end of
the year.

Panther Notes: Pitt leaders
after seven games. Rushing:
Curvin Richards, 565 yards. Adam
Walker, 257 yards. Passing: Alex
