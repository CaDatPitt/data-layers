Snow drifts around the Cathe-

18 inch fal-liset an all-time recordiin

studentbody attended the majority
of their scheduled classes, even
though ittook them up to. three
hours to come to school.

Large crews of workmen from.
the Department of Buildings and

rounds worked front 5 o’cloc_kl in

night to clear,  walks around the
Cathedral, but the. snow kept fall-
ing and drifting toundo the work
of the shovelers. V

First hour classes were scantily
attended, although laV majority of
them were held in "spite of the

of threes, and tours, rapidly ﬁlling
classesfwhich. originally had a ten
per cent attendance. '

is up to the individual"instructors

So many calls swamped the
University switchboard during the
early afternoon that an extra op-
erator had to be pressed into serv-
ice. Inside calls were restricted so
that’ lines could be kept open for
calls from outside the University.
One student, anxious to get to
his classes, skiied to school from
Regent Square andparked his skis
in the garage under the Cathedral.
Students from Mt. Lebanon, Dor-
mant, and Carnegie who usually re-
lied on street cars to bring them to
school either walked or “thumbed‘"’
their way into the city. Prepared
for anything, several came in full
ski attire. The majority "reported

Two weeks later that country officially

Tonight there will be what might be called the
posthumous dedication of another room, for the
country which it honors also has ceased to exist.
Poland once more has been divided by its neigh-
bors.

‘lut on the first floor of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing there are still two rooms which seek to pre-
serve within their walls some of the art, some of
the culture of those vanished countries, whose only
other haven is in the hearts of the men and women
who formerly were citizens of those countries

Last year the News expressed its opinion of

changed our opinion.

once before and that Czecho-Slovakia was only a
makeshift conglomeration of unrelated peoples
and lands. ‘Ne see no excuse there for the present
condition of those peoples.

Some people even tell us that it 1na.kes no real
difference‘ who_ governs a "land, that the people
will stay the same, their culture --remain-’ un-
changed. We cannot in any way agree with that
opinion. Surely a land which shows so little re-
spect or appreciation for its own culture that it
judges its art and other achievements on the basis
of the beliefs or heredity of the artist will do little
to preserve the culture of a dependent race.

No matter what “our friend across the way”
may think up to do next, and he does have a fertile-
imagination, there will still be Czecho-Slovaks,

there will still be Poles, and there will still be at

Czecho-Slovak and a Polish room. at the University.

The Mayor Suggests
A Valuable Plan

Olfering University credit for research work
under the direction of city administrators and the
University faculty, as proposed by Mayor Scully
in his “interneship",’ plan, is not‘ just another
course‘ to be added to‘ the governmentiservice
division. '

Not only will the course provide for members
of the medical and dental schools, as stated in the
Mayor’s letter, but the wide range of activities in
a modern city administration will offer opportunity
for students in engineering, statistics, accounting,
economics , political science, and many other
courses to gain valuable experience. The experi-
ence will be doubly valuable, since it will be a
useful service to this community.

According to the Mayor’s proposal, the course,
for which studentswould receive a stipend, would
cost the University nothing. The expenses are ex-
pected to be borne by a grant from a foundation.
interested in such activities. Therefore, only the
‘details of the plan remain to be worked out’.

VVe feel that the University ofﬁcials and the
faculty should give the plan deepest consideration.
Since we do not see any reason that might arise for
refusing such an offer, the necessary details ought
to be coinpleted intime to offer the course next
fall. P "

Perhaps the Truth
Was Too Painful

Vile, nasty rumors have been ﬂoating between
the Connnons Room and the Tuck Shop in the
v.~'al<e of the late lamented Panhellenic Sing.

Following the touching display of sisterly af-
iection, in which  of the 11 women’s fraterni-
tizs satirized each other in their skits, there have
been whisperings that the Panhellenic Sing won’t
take place next year, or if it should, that all skits
will be censored on the twelfth ﬂoor before the
performance. ’

Another of these tales strikes at the Pitt News
and our report of last Monday evening’s catty af-
fair. Murmurings have been heard that reports on
Panhellenic affairs will be more favorable in the
fut.ure~—or else! It isn't that the News report
wa.s1‘i"t accurate; in fact, the very truthfulness of
our story was just too much for the delicate, sen-
sitive minds of some readers.

This impels us to explain our position. Our
job is to report news events truthfully and com-
pletely. Vlle are anxious to get all the facts about
news events from those involved, but We reserve
the riglit to use our own judgment in preparing
the story.

Much as we would like to oblige many well-
intentioned persons and groups on campus, we just
can ’t bring ourselves to permit our news columns
to be used as a propaganda medium, whitewash
sheet, or house organ. VVe’re= so obstinate that we
belieye in printing the truth, even when it hurts.

Psychologist Distinguishcs

Education from Propaganda

By Edgar Beige]

“Education may use the propa‘
ganda method, but the ideology in
back of education is in bold con-
trast to the ideology of propagan-
da,” declared Dr. William T. Root,
clean of the Graduate School and
professor and head of the depart-
ment of psychology, in an address
on “Psychological Aspects of Pro-
paganda” before the faculty Social
Science Seminar Monday afternoon.

Lamenting the lack of distinction
made between education and pro-
paganda, Dr. Root pointed out that
education follows objective, scien-
tiﬁc, logical, rational methods and
techniques, while propaganda “at-
tempts to product conviction by
emotional acceptance, even if the
material is pure lie-—all is fair in
love, war, propaganda, and adver-
tising.

“‘vVhisper Propaganda”

Although propaganda, especially
war propaganda, is being so consci-
ously analyzed in the minds of
many at a time like this, Dr. Root
attempted to deal with the more
subtle side of the art, passing over
war propaganda as “so overt and
obvious that it is not necessary to
discuss.” Rather, he explained the
propaganda technique possible. Es-
pecially with the appearance of
-new media has the technique taken
on ‘added power, despite the fact

: that we are ever more conscious of
the -presence of Qropaganda.

Yet
propaganda—consc1ousness is not
prevalent among the “masses,” who

. need it most; analysis has not kept

 pace with the appearance of pro-

paganda; the average man is una-
; ble to cope with its sources, e. g.,

is the minds -of Hitler, Coughlin, and

On tap?  Then recite I
your qualifications!

By Mary Sutphen and Kal Kalwary

Wanna beer? Of course you do. But it’s not yours
just for the asking or the paying. You must recite your
qualiﬁcations for same to the bartender—-your hobbies,
your lodge affiliations, your opinions on the advisa-
bility of continuing the Dies Committee. 

Then, after you have spieled on all of this, the man
in the white jacket who makes with the suds, mulls it
over, consults the waitresses, the manager, and mulls
some more. All the while you just sit idle. at a table
trying to be nonchalant. You light a cigarette, but it
doesn’t stay lit. You see about ﬁve hundred people
staring at you. You hear ﬁve thousand people talk-
ing about you.

You look up to take a fresh bite of air, and ‘i:here’s
that suspicious man in the white jacket, some waitresses,
the manager, the ﬁve hundred faces and the ﬁve thou-
sand voices. The manager shakes his head as if pitying
some nit-wit. The waitresses’ lips are turned up, sneer-
like. The bartender takes on the proportions of an ogre
and roars, “No!”

You ain’t twenty—one, that’s all. You don’t wanna
beer!

Psychological Fundamentals
“Science,” Dr. Root analyzed,

“stands at the opposite pole from
-propaganda. But we may lose our
scientiﬁc outlook that gained such
-tradition during the 19th century.”

In the face of present-day propa-
ganda attacks, there appear such
things as Nordic physics, Soviet
biology, Teutonic Aryanism, ad in-
ﬁnitum. ‘

As a psychological fundamental,
Dr. Root explained that propaganda
of hate is substantially more suc-
cessful than propaganda of friend-
ship. “Man is more prone to hatred
because he is unsatisﬁed; fearing
he has missed the meaning of life,
he is jealous lest others have found
it.” This easily explains the pre-
valent Russian class hatred, and the
German-Italian religious-racial po-
groms.

“Confucius Say”

Yet most propaganda is old stuff
in new dress; the “seeing is believ-
ing” technique is being reﬁned
daily; vivid, detailed, perceptive
ads, charts, speeches are constantly
used to deceive and or convince.
Dr. Root summarized the famous
Hitlerian doctrine of propaganda.
Says Hitler: “Al1 propaganda must
be popular, on such a level" that the
most stupid will understand it; pro-
paganda must not serve the truth!
Don’t worry about the thinking
few (especially the university
“ape”). Say little, repeat often.”

Chairman Dr. Richard Hope, pro-
fessor and head of the department
of philosophy, merely observed:
“This Confucius Say business must
be Chinese propaganda.”

Seal, Defroster Fives
Win Torrid Battles
In Wednesday’s Play

Surprising form was shown by
teams in the Freshman Polar league
last Wednesday as the Seals defeat-
ed the Snowﬂakes and the Defrost-
ers downed the Polar Bears.

The Seals rolled up the amazing
total of 46 points in defeating the
Snowﬂakes, who scored 37. Both
scores were high, considering that
the game was 10 minutes under
regulation time.

Copetas, Seals’ guard, stole the
scoring spotlight by touching just
about everything that hit the bank-
ing board and tipping a many al-
most-lost shots into the net for a
total of 16 points.

Maston, Seal captain shone de-
fensively while Hennanvproved his
ability to dribble down the ﬂoor 111-
to scoring territory.

7Artman’s Snowﬂakes, with Swa-
kus back in the lineup, showed bet-
ter than they did in their ﬁrst time
out, but had an uncanny ability to
throw the ball away in enemy terri-
tory. Swakus, Artman, and Frey
played ﬁne ball, the ﬁrst two scor-
ingnine points each and the latter
eight. . . _, .  .

‘The’ second game ’-showed less
scoring and more defensive ,play as
the Defrosters set down “the Polar
Bears, 34-24. Malarkey was the
shining star for the Defrosters, not
only for his high point total of 12

but also for his all-round play. ﬂ

both defensively and offensively.

l Williams, who's small and fast,
and Anania, Who’s big and fast,
helped make things miserable for

the Polar Bears. Lohmeyer couldn’t "

get his team going although Del-
Vecchio with ,nine..,points and Mc-
Gonegly with seven" played good

Haluska’s effectiveness had a

Day as ctlvities

Bowling headlines the intramural
schedule today with a half dozen
matches scheduled. One match, that
involving the PiKAs and the Phi

Kaps, will have an important bear-
ing on ﬁrst standing.

A total of 23 wins against seven
losses gives the PiKas the fratern-
ity lead, but the Phi Gains, close
behind, stand to gain by any losses-
suffered by the leaders. The Fijis
have been assured their victories
against the Sammies, who have for-
feited their remaining games, while
the Phi Kaps are out to knock off
the leading PiKas. '

Scoring honorshave been monop-

ilized by the third place Pi Lams
who at the present hold two indi-
vidual titles. In three games bowled
Burt Engelsberg has totaled 572
for an average of 190.6. The Pi
Lams are deadlocked for high
team merits with the Phi Eps, with
755 for a total and an average of
151.

Engineering bowling is led by the
Industrials with a won-lost of 15-3.
In Independent ranks Amity Club

basketball crown when they toppled
the PiKAs, 43-21.

Five ﬁeld goals and ﬁve free

the scoring for the contest. The
win was the latest of an unbroken
streak begun when the Craig Street

boys won their ﬁrst game in the

late fall.

A one-sided battle between the
Phi Gains and Phi Eps, taken by
the Fijis, 33-ll, had two Phi Gams,
Bob Thurbon and Bill Edmunds,
scoring honors with 10
points apiece. The win kept the
Phi Gams well up in the race.

Eliminating Pi Kappa

Chis, were idle during Wednes-
day’s action. The only black mark
against the Theta Chis is a loss ad-
ministered by the Phi Kaps in a
recent rout that was to have been

the intramural contest of the sea- "

SOI1.

Tuesday, in one of the outstand-
ing upsets of the season, the Phi
Kappa ﬁve completely swamped
their Theta Chi opponents by a 41-

‘ 13 score. :

Led by TomHolloran, who rolled
up 12 points, and displaying an air-
tight defense, the Phi Kaps took
possession of the lead in the fra-
ternity league by their‘ victory.
Wild Bill” Fitchko was high man
for the Theta Chis with three bas-

kets and a foul for a seven point I

total. Phi Gamma Delta made it
two one-sided games ‘when they
defeated the Lambda Chi quintet
by a 43-6 tally. Footballer Bob
Thurbon paced the winners, tally-
ing 15 points. 7

In the Delta Tau Delta-Kappa
Sigma battle personal fouls took
their toll on Emil Narick and “Big

Alpha, 43-21

Chief” Kish as the Delts won, 24-22.
Footballers Narick and John Stahl
each scored seven points for the

"Delt ﬁve.

. The Pi Kappa Alpha squad fell
before the Sigma Chi’s, 27-23, with
both teams ragged on shooting and
defense. Barrett caged 12 points
for the Phi Kappa Alpha boys and
McLaughlin scored 10 for the win-
ning Sigma Chi team.

The other game played found the

Phi Eps victorious over the SA M  1

club, 35-18. Riefer was high point
scorer for the Phi Epsilon Pi ﬁve.

Volleyball competition saw only
one game played, and that had the
Phi Gams beating the Phi Kappa
Alpha spikers 3-0.

”MORE PLEASURE PER PUFF. . . MORE PUFFS PER PACK". . .

That’s how these three members of the U. S. Antarctic expedition tell of the advantages
of their favorite cigarette...s1ow-burning ‘Camels. Richard Moulton, senior dog-driver
(center), sums up when he says: “Slow burning is my measure of a milder, cooler, more
ﬂavorful smoke. I’d sledge a mile forﬂa Carifel.” Nothing destroys 21 cigarettes delicate
elements of ﬂavor and fragrance like the excess heat of too-fast burning. Cigarettes that
burn fast also burn hot. Camels are slower-burning...milde1', mellower, and —natu-
ral1y—cooler! Try Camels. Find out for yourself how slow-burning Camels give you
more pleasure per .p‘uE...and more puffs per pack—more actual smoking (see right).

The portraits in the “fine arts”

Many prominent (and many not

through the various emotions of in-
dignation, amusement, embarrass-
ment, despair, and weltschmerz
when they found that their picture
had been included.

of comic and uncomplimentary
Valentines dedicated to University
