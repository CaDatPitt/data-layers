Registration ﬁgures for the fall
semester show a slight decrease
over last year, but to students ac-
customed to_ crowded. halls and
-classes, it won’t be noticeable.

Preliminary registration totals
recently released by the Regis-
trar’s‘ofﬁce indicate a drop of 1200

fromgthe autumn enrollment peak —

i of" 19,957 set last year. This year’s
total is 18,749.

This registration marked the

ﬁrst fall in University history that
complete time schedules were
placed in the student’s’ hands
-priorto signing up. . ,

“In hundreds of instances,” ob-
served _Dr. Quick, “the schedules
prepareclby the students did not
have to be altered, and the time

 ‘of registration was reduced‘ to’ a

minimum.” «

»Baeking up the Registrar’s as-
sertion was the record—breaking
ﬁgure’ of 4066 registered in a
single day — Wednesday, Sept. 15.
Totals for Monday’ and Tuesday
were only slightly lower.

At the same time Dr. Quick ex-
pressed regret that the long sum-

» 'mer session prevented a more ex-
; . tensive pre-registration such as
' that carried out last "spring.

Most of the decline in enroll-
ment was suffered by the graduate
and‘ ‘undergraduate schools and
the J ohnstovvn Center. Profession-
al schools, with _the exception of
the Schools of Pharmacy and So-
cial Work showed slight increases".

Despite the drop, Registrar J.
G. ‘Quick said that the pre-regis-

S-tration estimate of"23,000 for the‘

year_ 1948-49 “would seem at least
conservative.” Total registration

ﬁgures, are based ,on‘enrollrnents‘

over the three ‘semesters of the
school._"yea1'.

bles which have plagued the or-_'

According - to .Ed ‘Zadorozny,

If Youcei High,
Then Feel Low - -
Here's a Cure:

It’s been said that those who
ride the Cathedral elevators
have their ups and downs. but
the new freshmen usually have R

more. than their share. For
them, here’s some handy in-
‘formation:

Those who want their monéy’s
worth may take any elevator
they please, but there are. four
locals which travel between the
ground ﬂoor and 18. These stop
at certain "designatd levels, with
convenient stairs to interme-
diate floors. Locals do not stop
‘between 1 and 5.

If you’re ‘high class, you can
take one of the four expresses
from ground or ﬁrst floor

straight to the 18th and points
north. Here again, stops -are
posted for certain floors, with
nearby stairs which go both di-
_ rections.

Take your choice, but be sure
you know where you want off
and which elevator stops there.
Oh yes, don’t forget to call
your stops. when you get on.

Prom Posts Open

Applications will now be ac-
cepted for undergraduate stu-
dents wishing to serve on the

To Precede
Irish Game

A tea dance and‘ a pep rally,
each the first of its kind this year,
will ﬁll Friday afternoon and eve-
ning as the University students
prepare to add their voices to
those of the alumni in celebra-
tions preceding Saturday’s game
with Notre Dame.

First on the list, the tea dance
takes place in Syria Mosque. It
begins at 3, p.m. and continues
until 6 p.m. Brad Hunt and his
orchestra will provide the music.

At 7 p.m.’, just an hour after
the dance’ ends, the rally opens
up on the Bigelow side of the
Cathedral.‘ Sportscaster ‘Woody
Wolfe, the man who broadcasts
Pitt’s football games for KDKA,
will act as» masterof ceremonies
for the rally. He will be introduc-
ed by Frank Blackstone, head
cheerleader.

Also on the program, tentative-

ly, is a mass parade to follow the-

Boulevard up‘ Aifth Avenue to
-rally. The parade is subject to ap-
proval ‘by city oﬁicials. Standing
in the. way of the permit is the

‘Ballot Bounce’

Ballot boxes, pink elephants, and
blue donkeys will paint the'polit-
ical picture when the sophomore
class’ “Ballot Bounce” moves
into the William.Penn main ball-
room Oct. 8. Polls open at 9 p. m.

- Campaign posters have already
appeared on strategic bulletin
boards with campaign promises
aplenty. These promises are
unique, Committee Chairman
Beverly Snyder asserts, in that
they are all true.

Baron Elliot and his bloc of
musicians will climb on the band-
Wagon for the sophomores, and the

promises include a ﬂoor show of
local night spot entertainers
during intermission and programs
in the form _of specimen ballots.

“Ballot Bounce,” ﬁrst, annual
social function of the year spon-
sored by Student Congress, is en-
tirely non—partisan in that the
entire student body is invited’ to
attend. Poll tax has been set at
$3.‘25‘per couple if the ticket is
bought in advance, and $3.75 at
the door. Bob Dompka, ‘ticket
chairman, advises all constituents
to_ buy tickets from the committee
members or at the Student Desk.

“Pop” Warner began an era of
football supremacy at Pitt which
lasted 23 years. The fundament-

alswhich he devised in the single ,

wing and double wing systems
revolutionized football. While
coaching at Pitt his teams won 58
while losing nine and tying four

A memorial tribute to the late

Dr. John B.'Sutherland, Warner’s .

successor, will be presented 'be-

Players‘ Subscription   Tickets
New on Sale at Strident Desk

Meeting as growing ‘student demand" -to reduce the number of 
money-grabbing campaigns throughout the year, Pitt Players yes- 
terday opened a sale of subscription tickets covering the entire

1948-49 dramatic season.
The book of four tickets, selling

' at $3,: represents‘ a ‘smog, of a

dollar on reserved '-seats, pegged
at $1 for each performance.

Starting off with the Oscar-
winning “Philadelphia Story” Oct.
~22, 23, and 24, Players will pro-
duce Jean-Paul Sartre’s “The
Flies’?_ beginning Dec. 10. Sartre
is the author of “The Respectable.
Prostitute” and “No Exit.”

Spring 1949, brings Shaw’s
“Candida” ,_and ﬁnishes _oﬁ the
,year with the earthy Kentucky

      

Mountain story, ‘.‘D_ark of the
Moon.” p A _ .

Jim Voris, publicity directorof
the group, believes
schedule indicates that Players are

beginning one of their biggest sea-__ '

sons in many years. - .
The four—for-the-price-of—three

book is on sale at ‘the ‘Student ..

Desk, or can be obtained from any
Players member. The sale lasts
until Oct. 22.

Another innovation, the return, ..
to a reserved seat section which . 
includes the entire ﬁrst ﬂoor of .

Foster Memorial Hall, has ‘been

The Big Parade
We won’t have a big parade on Friday after the pep

rally. In fact, we may not have any parade at all.
If we don ’t it won ’t be the fault of Student Congress. Con-

gress members made big_ plans during ‘the: summer for this ~—

ﬁrst pep rally. It was to come off in conjunction with Alumni
,Homecoming celebration and the parade was to encompass all
of Oakland and vicinity. Some of the more sanguine students
even envisioned a march on the downtown district.

Then came the Morewood-Shadyside Civic Association.
They didn’t object to the parade—probably because they didn’t
know about it. But they did drag the University into court
over the sports program at Ellsworth Field. The resultant bad
publicity made school officials a’ little chary of anything like
the parade Student. Congress wanted.

You can’t very well blame the University for putting tl1_e
soft pedal on the parade. You can’t go around stepping on
people’s toes when they are going to have to ask these same
people to" furnish the 1noney( or at least a good share of the
money) to ﬁnance our $18,000,000 building program.

So our parade is to be just a shadow of the original plans.
Instead of winding through Oakland it will take a short con-
stitutional dow11 Fifth Avenue and back up Forbes Street.
Vile probably won’t disturb anyone but a few transients in
the \Vebster Hall Hotel. 

So it’_s just aicombination of unfortunate circumstances
that’s holding us back, and not a lack of desire on the part
of Student Congress or the University ofﬁcials.‘And if we have
to blame anyone it would be a few neighbors who have gotten

' a little old and can’t quite understand people who feel, and

. "pus who eats food for lunch. The-

     
 
  
       
 

are, young.

Swan ofihe Weak

By PAT SEGER

I planned to label this article ‘Tuck ‘Shop Manners,’ but
I can’t. After spending ‘three years at the University,.I’m con-
vinced there are no such things. '

Sure, there was a time when I, too, carried my table

-ually be healthy. '

‘a few times a week. But now I’m

_ too.’

A discussion , of some new saddle-

, persons think manners at lunch

manners into the Red and Blue¢

sort of helplessly_ indoctrinated, so
I check my manners at -the door,

Don’t be alarmed. To keep my—‘
self from becoming completely
beastial I eat oif-campus occa-
sionally. ~

The battle fora bite surges on
the Tuck Shop in two waves at
lunchtime. “B, (for bump) Hour”
descends about 11:30 a. m. and
struggles on ’til 12:30 p." m., at
which time it Wearily surrenders
to ~ “T (for thump) Hour.” If
y.ou’ve ever tried to weather the
mob between these hours, "you"
know what I mean.

Major battle of the afternoon
is one of dirtyglooks, fought be-
tween the calofie countin’ coffee
sipper and the BIG man on cam-

coffee sipper is usually seated
\

dreamily before an empty cup,
while the BIG man tries to bal-
ance food and books and fatigue
while looking for a seat.'

Why, especially at lunch time,
so many persons decide to drool
over a cup of coffee has always
puzzled me. Perhaps a tiny in-
strument attached to the cup and
sending a mild shock through a
person’s hand as the newly emp-
tied cup is placed on the saucer

‘would solve the problem.

But, since such instruments are
both expensive and scarce, there
is nosrelief in sight.

To go back to the guy searching

‘for a seat. Said search ends when

61/2’ by 2’ person squeezes into a
15 cubic foot of space, unloads
his food on someone‘s ‘notebook,
and tries to elbow some ‘nourish-
ment mouthward. All I can say is:
How cramped can it get?)

Getting out of the Tuck Shop poses another problem. Al-
ways goodfor creatinghyper-tension is the close little group

of four who decide to have a
or in one ofthe narrow aisles.

reunion right ‘in the doorway

You can scream ‘excuse me’ up¢
and down the scale of your voice,
but it doesn’t phase them in _their

shoe polish.- After observing oth-
ers, ..I’m. convinced a light shove
subtly‘ applied clears the -way.
Hat—pins aren’t bad either.

The trouble really is that most

time begin and end with using a
salad fork for salad, and a soup

spoon_ for soup.

0 If you get up and give someone
your place after you've eaten, you
can eat your jello with a knife
and butter your pie with a fork.

Even then, you score -much
higher on lunch time manners
than the person who looks season-
ably bored consuming a cup of
coffee while bending the elbow
correctly for an hour or more.

Net Produci-

By Myron Kopelman

At the start of each new se-
mester ’a lot of upperclassmen, by
way of conversation, ask their
freshmen friends how they like,
their new school. The answer of
many is that “Pitt is all right, .-
guess, but it’s lifke a big city.”

Ever since the world’s tallest‘
school building opened its arms,
lap, and hip pockets to the mass
of post—war students, they have
been tagging it a metropolis.

The name “Pitt” has become‘
synonomous, with crowding,
shoving, and noise—making, and it
would be hard to deny the charge.
But the question remains whether
such atmosphere might not act-

Acfiviiy-a Good Sign

Activity is looked upon by some
people as a, sign that something
is being accomplished, that pro-
gress is being registered. Of
course, a baby can keep busy for .
hours just toying with a rattle
and a teething ring, and that
hardly represents progress.

Yet Pitt’s playthings are on a
somewhat higher level than rat-
tles. For example, there is is the
University’s $25,000 ice box that
freezes liquid mercury into hard
chunks and air into solid blocks.
Research with the contraption
aims at cutting the cost of stee
production. ' 1

If Pitt means crowding, shov-
ing, and noise-"making, then it
also means a cheaper automobile
for the consumer sometime in the
future. ~
We're Sfiﬂ Growing ,

It was recently learned, fur-
thermore, that the big city is go-
ing to grow still bigger.

The University plans to build,
among other structures, a medical
building and a science building.
The building program will move
Pittsburgh clo_ser to its goal of be-_,
coming the science capital of the
world, which in turn means in-
creased medical ‘ research of
world-wide importance.

If Pitt means crowding, shov-
ing, and noise—making, then it al-
so means life-saving. '

_With industrial, medical, and
atomic research, with building and
cultural programs, Pitt students
should not be too ashamed of their
big city when it is contrasted, to
the small-town college, I sprawling
lazily in the peace" and quiet of
what is often a do-nothing exist-

Random thoughts on a return tﬁitt . . .

UNI. This season is no exception. For the time being; the

campus is all happiness and light. The full impact of loads 

of work is yetto be felt and I can cut classes with a compara-
tively clear conscience.
The new crop of frosh coeds is more pleasant to consider

than is the thought that later on it will cost a cool sawbuck if

to squire any one of them on an evening of frivolity. The
sun is still smiling on the campus and it’s good to be back.
=)i= =X= as

Some coldhearted individual ruined every kind thought I
ever had fo.r the capitalistic system when he told me the Tuck

Shop and University Bookstore were non-proﬁt institutions.‘

All along.I had pointed out both units as" epic moiuunents to
the fact that enterprise was not dead in America. contraryto
what theboys from the other side of the ‘iron curtain have
to say. _ . ‘ A . _

Andgthen this character, this despoiler of ideals, told me‘
that nobody makes’ any money in Pitt ’s junior Astor bar, ther
Tuck shop, and further hinted that that beehive of industry,

the bookstore might even go into the (pardon the expression)

red’ at’ the end of each day. '
With the vicious ‘propaganda pounding inside my head’
like a _bee -in a pop bottle, I began to look at things in "a

1 different light. I beganto wonder who, if anybody, "niakesigi
an honest buck- around this ‘place? What strange ‘essence is '

served in coffee cups, the stuﬁ at eight cents per, that we
chug-a-lug in that‘ smoke-fouled den?

How much nonproﬁt can you make?'Does -the ice-cream ped-l “

dler at the end of thevBigelow Boulevard walk work‘ for the

goodgof the_s:tuden‘t‘body or. is he slyly going home at night 
with a few cents to the good? Who pays the rent for the new 

’ atom-‘smasher? How? '

, VVe»ha’ve at Pitt what »might easily’ be the most heavily S
endowed University in the world. We have an enrollment,

that makes a staggering ﬁgure. Our medical center will rank
among the greatest of the great. VVhen the building program
is completed, our campus will be a thing‘ of superlative beauty.

Wit.h all these Wonders cradled here lll the heart of inighty
Pittsburgh’s cultural‘ center, why don ’t the powers-that-be
loosen up and allow themselves a slight margin of proﬁt? If
they don"t,:there might be talk. about the Cathedral of Learn-
ing taking‘a tilt to the right. ~ ' N ' Q

Nonproﬁt organizations like the University bookstore and
the'Tuck Shop might not be experiments in socialism but the
sound of the phrase “Leaning Tower of Oakla11(” has a
morbid ring. . _

No, Ma, that ain’t the mumps. That’s just my tongue in
my cheek. '

°inﬂuencing any beginning fresh-

men, may now discuss fraternity
matters with these students.

In contrast with last year’s pro-
cedure, when there were three
weeks rushing, this year will see
a total of four weeks.——three weeks

of informal and one week of -for—'

mal rushing. A similar procedure
has previously been followed by
sororities.

During the informal period
which lasts ‘until Monday, Oct. 18,
“rushees” are not allowed in the
fraternity houses nor may they be
entertained at meals.

During ‘the formal period which
starts Oct. 18,’ freshmen may be
invited to luncheons, afternoon
events, dinner and evening affairs.
-At no time‘ may they stay over-
night. ~

Formal rushing will close Sun-
day, Oct. 24, and the “period of
silence”, will begin. Fraternities
will submit bids for students to
-the Dean_ of Men’s office at that
time but they will not be allowed
to contact any freshman.

Complete details of ‘rushing and
initiation rules are available at
the Dean of Men’s office.

e second major uniform
changeover in a year for Pitt

-ROTC cadets was announced this

week by Colonel John I. Hincke,
professor ‘ofmilitary science and
tactics at the University.

 The new uniforms for both basic
. and advanced corps cadets will be .
"regulation officer type pinks and
" igrieensé These uniforms will in

time replace both. the olive' drab
“Eisenhower jacket” uniforms now

' Worn by members of the advanced

Artillery,- Quartermaster, and En-

»‘gi‘neer cadets, and'the traditional
2 ‘blue and gold uniforms which for
_over twenty years have been ‘the

distinctive Pitt cadet uniforms.
= ..This new change comes just one
year after the military department

began replacing the blue and gold

outﬁtswith olive drabs. . _

The new orders still nmaintain
the traditional difference between
basic_ and -advanced‘ corps uni-

. forms.

For, basic students the uniform
will be‘ completely officer—green,
with green trousers, and green
blouses now worn only by the ad—
by the advanced Air cadets.‘

‘Under the newly announced
plan, the advanced corpsmen of
all four branches will be outﬁtted
with the" pink trousers and green
blouses nok worn only by the ad-
vanced Air ROTC.

The transition ‘from blue and
-gold to pinks and greens will not
be immediate, the military depart-
ment adds. Many of the advanced
students. who were issued olive
drab uniforms last year will retain
these uniforms for the rest of their
ROTC training at Pitt.

._‘Both the olive drab and pinks
_and greens have been regulation
uniforms for regular army, officers
since last April when Chief of

University in September, 1919.
The government provided each
cadet with a world Warl officer-
type uniform.

When‘ the R e s e r v -e Officers
Training Corps became better es-
tablished throughout the nation,
the War Department offered funds
to the various colleges to purchase
uniformsof any type they thought

 ROTC Uniforms Changed '  

Eor Second Time in Year

appropriate.

Some ‘institutions, continued to
use "the GI -clothing, but others,
including Pitt, established distinc-

A tive cadetstyles.

The ﬁrst of these new uniforms
appeared at Pitt in the early- twen-

ties. They consisted of blue trou-

sers with gold strips and a high
neck West Point style blouse. For

dinner and‘ formal affairs there

was a dress uniform, white mess
jacket, gloves, stiﬁ shirt, bow tie
and blue trousers. -
~ High collared blue jackets were
replaced in the thirties by the
present blue coats with lapel" ‘col-

The bluesgpresented a far SK 2..-

pier 1' appearance than the World?

War uniforms and were in keep-
ing with the styles at such purely
military schools as Virginia Mili-
tary Instiute and Culver Military
Academy.

The new styles, both for the
advanced and the basic sstudents,
are identical with regular army
oﬁicers uniforms, except for de-
tachable cadet insignia.

wseA Commission

(Continued from Page 3)‘
such action, Miss Reynolds hopes-
each woman student will soon
realize that she may play an ac-
tive role in determining WSGA
policy. V

According to the president of
WSGA, the ﬁrst meeting Thurs-
day night is, planned along the
lines of a theme acquainting each
member with the responsibility
involved. Speakers for the various
divisions of commission are sched-
uled to describe the type of work
their respective sections do
throughout the year.

Since the meeting is open, wom-
en students who can attend are
invited by Miss Reynolds ‘to “come
in and see their government i
action.” '

Lost And Found Dept. Offers

Quick And Efficient Servce

Possession is three-fourths ownership—but the other one-fourth

is left for the loser. L
The Lost and Found departm

ent, located in the post office on

the -ground ﬂoor, ‘is the possesso_.¢
of hundreds of unclaimed articles.
Mr.-Oscar Kapif, head of the Lost
and Found, is eager to clear his
shelves of the coats, books, pens,
pencils and babushkas turned into
his department.

Sixty-three items were turned

day last year. Over: 4000’-items
were turned in during the period
from Sept." 1947 to June; 1948-
over 3000 of them claimed.

Mr. Kapif blames the enorm-
ous ‘amount of unclaimed articles
on the students’ ignorance that
such a department exists within
the university. He urges students
to call for lost articles the day
after the disappearance is notic-
ed. ~

Text books, work books, wear-

ing apparel, pens and pencils,
make up the bulk of the articles
foundin the Tuck shops, the Com-
1nons_Room, girls room,‘ and ﬁrst
ﬂoor class rooms.

Recently a can ofﬁea powder
was turned in to ‘Mr. Kapif, and
soon claimed; Between Sept., 1947
and June, 1948, 136 purses were
found and ultimately claimed at
the lost and found. .

Mr. Kapff attributes this to the
fact that, wherever possible, cards
are sent out to people ‘informing
them that their belongings have
been found and are available at
the Lost and Found department.

n spite of Mr. Kapff’s attempts
to ﬁnd owners of lost articles,
many items go unclaimed and
after 30 days are given to the
Student Book Exchange.

honored at an informal tea given
by the Norwegian Ro_om Commit-
tee and the Nationality Rooms’
Council on Friday evening, Oct. 1,

-in _Foster Memorial. .'

Both women have recently re-
turned’ from summer trips to Eu-
rope awarded them by the two
groups. Miss Rush’s 10-week trip
to Norway was sponsored by the
Norwegian Room Commitee. This
is an annual presentation to a stu-
dent or faculty member most de-
serving such an award.

sponsored Miss Kostelnik’s trip to
France. Also an annual award,
this 10-week fellowship is given
that student, who, in the opinion
of the Nationality Rooms’ Council,
makes most vivid the meaning of
the Nationality Rooms to visitors
and fellow students. I

Highlighting the reception will
be brief talks by Miss Rush and
Miss Kostelnik. These will con-
cern the impressions gathered by.
the two women on their European
trips. Steve Babic, chairman of
the Nationality Council, and W. A.

Hintof Panthér
  Passing Attack

The tip-off to .Pitt’s little-
suspected ability to pass came»
as early as last Vlrednesday.

Head Coach‘Mike Milligan,‘
asked by a News reporter if he
was hoping for a rainy Satur-
day to foil SMU’s feared aerial
attack, ﬂashed his neon smile wry-
ly and replied, “Remember, we
threw more passes than, they did

Beside the Point
- Milligan’s answer seemed to be
a masterful example of an irrela-
tive statement.

It was wondered at the time
whether Mike’ was subtly hinting
that the land-loving Panthers
would take to the airways against
SMU. If so, Milligan’s method of
hinting was like saying that it will
rain next Thursday because it
rained last Thursday.

Well, the Panthers, lead by Bim-
boo Cecconi and Bobby Lee, pass-
ed and passed with deadly aim.
Probably the «only complaint
against the passing was that there
was notenough of it.

_ Bimbo Practiced

The same Bimbo who completed
nine out of 18 heaves was throw-
ing high ﬂies last year. Backﬁeld
coach Josh Williams ‘attributed the
improvement to plenty of practice.
“Work, .Work, work—-that did it,”
declared Josh.

Milligan, although g r e a tl y
pleased with his 'team’s show-
ing, regretted that his charges
were unable to vary their ‘passing
with "powerful ‘ground plays.

“Both our line and our ball car-
riers Will have to hit harder to
run effectively,” said the Panther
mentor. “But we can do it, I know

Brennen Switched to Quarterback
In Early Fresh Football Workouts

By DAVE SMITH

Approximately 50 candidates
turn_ed out last week for Pitt’s
freshman football squad.

Practice sessions began Wed-
nesday at Ellsworth ﬁeld, under
the supervision of head frosh men-
tor Ted Schmitt and his aides, Ed
Shedlosky and former varsity cen-
ter Lee Ward.

Following calisthenics, the ﬁrst-
year aspirants were broken up in-
to two groups. With Ward direct-
ing, the linemen drilled on stance
and blocking assignments. Shed-
losky took charge of the backs,
who displayed their running tal-
ent in various play situations.

Finally the gridders split into
two teams and practiced as in-

dividual elevens. No scrimmages
were held .The first of these prob-
ably will get under way this week.
Calling signals for one of the
groups was the former North
Catholic star,,Bob Brennen.
Brennen, whose 205 pounds are
well distributed over a six foot
frame, performed in the blocking-
back slot, a position new to him.
During the ﬁrst half of his three
years as a football player at North,
Bob attracted notice by his activ-
ity as a center. Switching to full-
back, he closed the book on his
high. school grid career by gar-
nering a post on the All-Catholic
combine.
In addition, Brennen was a

State aggregation in last summer s
contest. at Forbes Field.

Despite such honors, Bob con-
siclers his participation in the
North—Central game last year as
the greatest ‘thrill of T his high
school competition. In that clash,
the Northsiders romped to a 46-6
Victory, their first in the long ser-
ies between the two bitter rivals.
Single wing plays won’t be new
to the freshman quarterback.
familiar with them, as well as
with those of the “T”.

VVith all his natural ability, Bob
seems a good bet to turn into as
effective a blocker and ﬁeld gen-

eral as he was a center and full-

member of Don Fletcher’s All-. back.

The Phi Gams demonstrated
this point last Thursday by over-

Little Skip Rebele of the Gams
performed like a miniature Doak
Walker as he tossedfor two touch-
downs and scored another two.
His initial TD pass came early in

is

the second quarter when he hit
Marty Frame with an aerial in
the end zone.

End Bill Lynam was his target
in the later moments of the ﬁrsi
hall‘ when another completed for-
ward marked the second tally.

After a Phi Kap drive had been
stopped on the Gams’ four-yaro‘
line, the Phi Gams quickly added
another touchdown. Frame shot
a pass to Lynam who, in turn
shovelled the ball to Rebele, and
the fast moving Gain star sped un-
molested for the score.
