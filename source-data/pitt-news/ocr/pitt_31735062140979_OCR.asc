Old Alumnus Speaks

 

Dr. Riddle, Who Attended the Uni-
versity in the ’40’s, Gives Remi-
nisc‘ences.

Dr. Riddle, one of the great clas-
sical scholars of this district, spoke
in Chapel last Friday morning. Dr.
Riddle’s father was chancellor of this
university around 1850. While await-
ing Dr. Riddle’s arrival, Chancellor
McCormick called ‘on Mr. Totten to
say a few words. Mr. Totten said
thathe had come to keep Dr. Riddle
straight and that he had graduated
from the Western University of Penn-
sylvania-in 1849. This announcement
created much applause. Upon Dr.
Riddle’s entrance, the audience arose
and greeted him ‘enthusiastically.

As was announced, Dr. Riddle gave
some of his reminiscences and delight

Dr. Bishop came forward with a glass
of water. “I never use that,” said Dr.
Riddle, ‘‘you' can’t run awindmill
,with'water.” Dr. Riddle brought with
him an old. catalogue from the years
1846-1848. In those days, the Univer-
sity was locatel in an old brick build-

. ing on Duquesne VVay near Fifth "St.

MEET

Before an immense crowd of ath-
”letic enthusiasts the sixth annual in-
tercollegiate and interscholastic track
and ﬁeld meet under the auspices of
the University was held on‘ the Schen-
ley Oval Saturday afternoon. Every-
thing from weather down, combined to
make the affair a grand success. A
number of new records were made,
every event was_ bitterly contested,
and altogether, the -games were pro-
nounced by all the most interesting
Pittsburgers have ever witnessed._

Captain Bryson’s gallant athletes
were compelled to take second honors
in the college class to the Carnegie
Technical schools team. The latter
proved somewhat of a surprise and de-
veloped unexpected strength in events
which had been practically conceded
to the Blue and Gold. Tech scored a
total of 48 points against 371-6 for
Pitt. Westminster was third with
201-2 points, Grove City fourth with
201-6 points and Western Reserve,
lby capturing four ﬁrsts, was a close

peted in this class, Johnstown High
Schooland University School of Cleve-
land not being represented.

Class B Scholastic events, with 16
points: Allegheny High School, thanks
to the magniﬁcent work of its two ath-
letes, J. and M. Marshall, was a close,

LOYALTY.

 

Several times during the last week,

students injthe University have spok-
_.e’n” of the “knocking” spirit prevalent

,_  here. "It is not the number of knock-
’ . _, ers with which we must contend, but
A_ .rather theirnoiseiness. Pitt men, the
, , time has come when knocking must be

stopped. No longer can this senseless

' ~ hammeringat our institutions be per-

mited. If you have nothing good to say,

I say nothing. By this we do not mean

that allattempts to correct existing
evils orto improve present conditions

should not be encouraged. Let us use
. all'_our powers in strengthening our

school and itsinstitutions. But what
is the advantage of plain" ordinary
knocking? It does no good. It presup-
poses that everything‘ is bad. The
knocker is a pessimist of the worst"

. kind.‘By his tactless attacks, he loses

his chance to secure real betterment
of conditions, if they be bad. So from
his own standpoint the knocker is
~ Then he isdoing the school a great’
deal of harm; How. doesait sound to

f the outsider. to hear a Pitt man tear-
.’ ing to pieces his own school? If the

.  knocker would only consider the harm
‘ he"sdoing by influencing outsiders ad-

versely to -Pitt, we believe he would

not,‘he should be. driven out of school.
Why do you comeito Pitt,.if you do
not like it? So we say to the knocker,
show some loyalty, quit knocking, or

Iifget out of, Pitt- And we believe the
_;’student body says the same.

THE JUNIOR CLASS.

There are two questions which the
Junior Class_should settle in the next

I few days. The ﬁrst is that of the class
' memorial. The ﬁrst class in the his-

tory of‘ the University to make any
considerable gift to the school’ before.

‘graduation, the class of 1912 should

not permit their classmemorial to be
'We are informed », by the
Treasurer of’ this "fund that a very

a Ride.

And if he does '

large. part of_,the‘ amountipledged is

THE PITT WEEKLY- '.I

already collected. "But there are still
a great many subscriptionsiunpaid.
Every effort should be made by the
members of the class to pay up their
subscriptions to date, so that the
memorial may be ﬁnished by Com-
mencement 1912. So much has been
done along this line that it would take
but little effort to raise suﬂicient mon-
-ey to start work on the memorial
next year. Then, the Junior classwill
have the-honor of instituting‘ a cus-
tom which will draw the members of
each class together,.'b11ild up school
spirit and m_ake our campus more beau-
tiful. But the money must soon. be
raised, if the memorial is to be com-
pleted by the commencement of the
Junior class.» Juniors,‘ do not let the
honor of starting this custom slip
away from you. Raise the money
needed immediately, so that alldoubt
as" to the plan’s success will be re-
moved. . ‘

» The second question before the Jun-
ior class ‘is that of the Junior Boat
Last year ,the Junior class
failed to ‘carry this through success-

’ fully. This custom is far too good to

be permitted to fall into ‘disuse so easi-
ly. 1

It is the duty of this year’s Junior

class to retrieve this error and pre-
vent the loss of a time-honored cus-
tom. It is rapidly approaching theitime
for this-event and if the class» is to
take any action, it ;must do so3;im-
mediately. Otherwise, the disghsace
will rest upon them that they with the
class of 1911 let fall an old tradition.
At the last meeting of the'Alumni
Council a committee was appointed‘
to aid inperpetuating there traditions.
Certainly if the Alumni can do this,
the Junior Class can. Some, action

must be taken and that ‘immediately. .

ADVICE TO SOPHQMORES.

At the time this-paper went to press

the Sopomore class had not yet_ elect-_

ed its Owl Board.‘ Through negligence
the Inter-collegiate meet Saturday was
not reported by any member author-
ized to prepare this meet for'publica-
tion in next year’s Owl- If the pre-
sent Sophomore class hope to turn
out a successful Own, it is necessary
for them to meet immediately and
choose the men whom they intend
to intrust with this important publi-’
cation. The last three months of the
school year must be chronicled in
next year’s Owl. If the class" of 1913
hopes to secure any complete report
of these events, the members of the
board must be chosen at once. I

Then we wish to call attention \toI

the plan‘ which the present Owl board

‘ has drawn up for future organizations.

The present board has had great dif-
peri.enced adviser. This adviser their
ﬁculty owing to the,lack of an ex-
plan if adopted will provide. In past
yearsia group of inexperienced men

with no advice or help have been ex-_

pected to start immediately after elec-
tion and produce an Owl‘of the high-

est quality. Under this system from

two to three menths were wasted each
year in learning the "duties of the
board. Under the proposed plan this
loss of time wiil be avoided. The plan

proposed by the present board shows
great care and a thorough ‘knowledge
of conditions. It should;‘b_e considered
very carefully by the Sophomore class.

selecting teachers. He spoke on many
subjects. We learned that in those

days at social gatherings, the boys,

drew lots for the girl to take home.
The speech was so interesting be-
cause we got an insight into theipast
from one who had lived in it.

Dr. Riddle stated that he had only
been late twice in hsi life. The ﬁrst
time when he was delayed by the
Johnstown ﬂood, the second when
the street car delayed him last Fri-
day morning.

of all was when he spoke of the debt

that it had done for him. To have

A living example of 1

I Pittsburgh

\

the University Annual of a type and
character that shall be second to‘ none.

It is an admitted and lamentable
truth among “Owl” Boards of the past

that. they have gone into the work '

of publishing the annual without any
deﬁnite plan‘ of procedure and with‘

but a vague conception of the numer-‘ ‘

ous requirements and details that are i.
essential to the production of a book,

that would do credit to its authors
and possessors. . ' I

The primary object -of the above/
outlined organization is, however, not
the standard or class of. material
which may compose the. “Owl.” but a
means for providing the material
with the least resistance by those up-
on whom deﬁnite and explicit respon-
sibilities are placed.

THE CORNELL FACULTY I
VALUE GREEK

A remarkable testimony. as to the
value of thestudy of Greek is given
in arecent issue of theplthica Daily
Journal, where over ﬁfty members of
the faculty subscribed .their names
to the ‘following statement:——

“We the undersigned professors (or : ~

one-time professors) of Cornell Uni-

versity should prefer as students in _

our ‘respective subjects those who
have included ‘both Greek and Latin
among their preparatory studies in

the high .school,‘rather than those who 4

have neglected thesestudies in ._fa-
vorof modern languages, or of our_
own respective studies.” '

The,list includes not only teachers ~

ofliterature, history, philosophy and
modern languages, but also prominent
engineers and scientists. The oppo--
nents of the classics are not now gen-
erally found among men of science,
as was the case to some extent a gen-
eration ago.

The following letter by ‘the vener-
able’ organizer of ‘Cornell University,

a man who has an international repu- —

tation as an educator, historian and

diplo1nati'st,\I Would like to quote in, I

this connection. V -
April 13, 1911.
“My opinion formed by long obser-

vation of the careers of university_ _i

and college graduates is that by the

study’ of Greek, ‘even if it be only -

through the Greek Reader, the__proba-
bilities of success in the professions
of law, medicine, theology, teaching
and of all "the natural sciences, are
very decidedly increased.
(Signed) Andrew D. White."

There are signs of a renewed in- _

terest. in the study. of Greek.. The
fact that Greek cannot be put to im-
mediate practical use as a means of
making money should not deter any

one who desires a truly liberal edu- -

cation from applying himself to learn
the language. ,

Many colleges now offer courses, in
Beginning Greek (The 'UI1iVeI'SitY 0'5-
included); and this ‘is
wise, as students may, even though‘
late in their course, acquire the 1311'
guage and read its literature. But it

is better, if possible, to begin Greek

at school, when the memory can more
readily» retain the forms and when

the pressure of other studies is not
so great. Certainly all college stu-
dents who expectto specialize in lit-
erature, or who are preparing to be-
come teachers of English or any oth-
er modern language, or history and
philosophy, will be at a serious disad-
vantage if they ‘have never studied
Greek.

T’__P_:rof. H. S. Scribner of the depart-
meI1t.0f Greek. ‘made an address last

Tuesday afternoon at the Allegheny.

The value of the study of Greek for

professions was explained, especially

for those who excell in Latin and Eng-

lish and who might look forward" to
teaching these subjects.

ALUMNI COUNCIL MEETS.

g Qfficial Song Adopted. .

 

‘Competitive System Proposed.

The Alumni Council met in Thaw
Hall, May 15, for the last business
-meeting of the school year. There was
a fair atendance. ' The "vacancies in
the Council were ﬁlled by the election
of F. B. Chalfant, ’06, from the Engin-
eering School and Robt. F. Weger, ’-10
from the Law School. The question
of adopting -oﬂicial songs. and cheers
was then discussed. Our song, “Pitts-
burgh” written by G. M. P. Baird, ’10,
was chosen as the ﬁrst of these songs.
A__ resolution calling attention to the
recentloss of many of the old school
traditions was then introduced. As
ﬁnally passed, it provided that a com-
mittee of three be appointed to per-
petuate school traditions.

A proposal was now made .that the
‘cdmpetitive system be instituted in all
fqrms of college activity, that the edi-
tor of the Pitt Weekly be chosen not
by election‘ of the student body, but by
competition. In fact if such a plan
were adopted, there would remain but
few officers whom the students could

/"elect. But several members objected
that this was a question for the stu-
dent body to decide. So it was passed
that the committee on Undergraduate
Activities take advisory action on in-
stituting the competitive system. The
motion was then carried to make the
Pitt Weekly the oﬂicial paper of the

C‘ alumni and to have it sent to every

member of the Alumni association.
This action will make it possible to
keep the alumnus.in touch with every
thing the school‘ is doing.

THE OWL ON FRIDAY

 

The Owl did not come on Monday as
was announced in the Weekly last
time. The editors have informed the
student body that it will not appear

until Friday. The Pitt Weekly again '

takes pleasure in announcing the Owl
and—u‘rges all students to procure the
book. ‘ '

_nua1
-Speech Nets Association.”

The Owl editors have told us that
special, attention,has been given to
student activities. The athletics espe-
cially are given'"in great detail with
many -interesting and valuable cuts.
We would like to say over again all
we said last week. ’

The Owl. is worth much more to a
student than it costs. Every student
and member of the faculty should
have the Owl.

PUBLIC SPEAKING PRO-
FESSOR HONORED

Professor Fish, the "instructor of
public speaking at Pitt, has been re-
quested to read a paper before the an-
convention of the “National
The Asso-
ciation is- composed of teachers, act-
ors, public readers and authors en-
gaged in the work of oral expression.

It will be held for ten days beginning In

June 26th, at Chattanooga, Tenn.
The importance of the convention is

"due to the fact that is is a national
"convention and will be attended by

the greatest men of this whole land
in the lines of public address. A re-
quest to speak before this convention
is a very great honor for Professor
Fish and for the“ institution which he
represents.

More ﬁgures have been collected but
these should suﬂice for some pretty
serious thought. Several things are
self-evident. The faculty are support-
ing chapel many times better than the
students in comparison to their num-
ber. The faculty have set an example
which the student body has not fol-
lowed as was promised. The students
will have to be ashamed of themselves
before these ﬁgures.

FINE LETTER SENT OUT

The following letter is ‘being sent

i— out by the College to prospective stu-

dents: . - - ,
To-High School Students: V
Many students enter college with

the purpose of specializing in English
~ and Latin} Such students too often

neglect Greek in their High School

course. They have not recognized the

importance of a-training in the clas-
sical languages, especially in Greek;
and in college they ﬁnd thit it is diffi-
cult to repair the deﬁciency.

The deplorable ‘loss of breadth suf-
fered by .each student'is not our pres-

/ . .
ent concern; we wish rather to direct

attention to their loss of eﬂiciency
as students‘ of Latin and English. It
is wellirecognized that Greek is the
master literature of the world. By

I this is meant, not simply that it is the

greatest literature, but that its influ-
ence over others is of supreme import-
ance. Ignorance of Greek, like igno-
rance of the Bible, blinds the student
to at least a part of the meaning of
hundreds of passages of modern liter-
ature. Even so modern a poem as

I Tennyson’s Ulysses or the Lotus Eat-

ters is scarcely intelligible without
some acquaintance with Homer’s
Odyssey. ' .

This knowledge may be had in
translation to be sure; but no trans-

- lation, however accurate, can produce

the power of a great classic. Transla-
tions are make-shifts, and ‘no student
who is planning, to make the utmost of
his opportunities will wish to be de-
pendent upon them. Moreover,‘ for

I , students of Latin and English a knowl-

edge of the original Greek has so
many linguistic advantages that, for

_ such stludents, reliance on transla-

tions is peculiarly short-sigheted econ-
omy. '
The advantages of translating from

‘Greek into English as a means of drill
 in English composition are impressed
upon‘ every teacher.

Original compo-
sition in English should be fofstered,
but not exclusively; for it permits
students to retain all their slovenly
abits of thought; whereas the transla-

_tion of a great classic, provided the

teacher insists on an adequate render-
ing, forces students to logical, exact

and spirited habits of expression.

Greek is probably the best language
available for the purpose. " _

The force of the foregoing para-

7 graphs is at least trebled, when ap-

plied to prospective teachers of Eng-

lfsh and Latin. Such teachers must

 

THI-: PITT WEEKLY

have a- trained sense of word-values,
hardly to be gained-without“ knowl-
edge of parent and cognate languages,

especially of Greek. Teachers of Lat- ‘

in and English literature should be
‘able to recognize at least the most ob-
vious reference to Greek authors
found in the writers they discuss;
and cannot gai nthis ability from mod-
ern reference works alone. _

To School Directors, Principals and

Teachers: ‘

School Directors, Principals and
teachers are urged to call the forego-
ing remarks to the attention of- the
students and to give, opportunity to
those who desire it to study Greek in
High School, I

Pitt Tennis Team Starts-Season by

Defeating Old Rivals. I

On Friday last the Pitt Tennis team
journeyed to Washington, Pa., to
meet the W.'& J. men. Our men
were feeling a little put out over not
being able to meet the Penn State
team on Thursday, and consequently
took their revenge on the Red and
Black team. Although our team. did
not put up their best game by any
means, yet W. & J. still hardly-had a
look in. The courts were in poor
shape and the weather exceedingly
warm, facts which accounted to a
great extent for the one set the Pitt
men lost.

Our team reported that they were
Very hospitably treated while in Wash-
ington.- Wilbert and Sloan were at
the Beta Theta Pi frat.ernity; Mack-
rell was at the Thi Gami Delta, and
McEl1roy put up atlthe Thi Delta
Theta. W & J. is well known for its
ﬁne hospitality. Summary:

PlTT’S INTER COLLEGIATE
MEET A GREAT success
— (Continued from page 1)

 

T unable to do all expected of him Sat-

'urday, this does not detract one iota »

from the credit due him for his loyal
.and consicentious work all season.
_~N ever has a captain of a university ath-
letic team worked harder to make the
team a success than he. Compelled
aby -reason of ﬁnancial circumstances
*to work almost every night in addi-

gition to attending to his college work

-during the day, “Cap’s” performances
havevbeen all the more remarkable.
The quarter mile race which he lost
to Steimnetz of Tech was a heart-
‘ ‘breaker as he led until almost the ﬁn-
'ish, being only beaten on the ﬁnal

' T _ spurt._ Hubbell of Western Reserve,

by doing the half mile in record break-
ing time, beat him in the half mile.
The University team also failed to
show its usual strength in the ﬁeld
‘ events. Not a single pointwas taken
in the discus throw, an event in which
the Blue and Gold could usually count
on at ‘least 5 points, Tinsley could
only annex 16 point in the high jump,
which was another disap, ointment.
On the other hand, Lichtenfels, the lit-

. tle Med. ‘runner, did clever work in
the distances, the mile and two mile, E

getting two seconds for a total of six
points. Davis, supposed to be a rank
outsider, fook second inthe hundred
and fourth in the 220 yard dash.
The mile college relayraee was per-
V haps the most thrilling _race of the day
"being won by Carnegie Tech. Halfer-
ty ran a ﬁne quarter for the _Varsity

on the second relay and the race was 

i even ‘when “Ham” Wooten took up
‘the t.ask. The -little colored sprinter
. tried‘ his hardest to maintain the fast

._ pace but ‘he was up against one of

1 Tech’s best men and Steinmetz the
plaid runner started off with a lead of
‘ almost -ten yards.
was after his opponent like a ﬂash
and succeeded in overtaking him on
the home stretch.» The effort was too
great for him however alld Steinmetz
won out on the sprint.

{CORNELL RANKS FRATERNITIES

The Comparative Scholastic Standing
of the Fraternity and‘ Non-Frater-

ternity “Honor Roll.”

President Schurrnan today gave out
the following statenient in regard to
the comparative scholastic standing of
fraternity and non-fraternity men
at Cornell as shown by. analysis of
the list of men dropped from the uni-
versity at the end of tfhe first term
of this year for failure to do satis-
factiry work: I

\.

men of Cornell University. a year ago
I announced the results of an in-
vestigation I had beenrmaking into
the relative scholastic standing oi
fraternity and non-fraternity men in
the University, using as a "basis for
my study the list of men dropped in
.February for failure to do satisfac-
tory work. My action in making pub-
lic during*that address the names of
theifraternities whose percentage of
men, lost. was lower than the aver-
age percentage for the University re-
ceived such universal approval from
the student and faculty members of
the fraternities as well as from their
alumni that I am encouraged to Be-

nity Men this Year: With’the Fra- -

In an address to the fraternity-

lieve that the publication each year
of similar statistics, including an

“honor roll” of the fraternities with

-good; records, will have a most salu-

tary effect in raising scholarship re-
cords of fraternity students. Earn-
estly hoping that such ‘will, at any
rate, be the effect I have again
this year made a study of the list of
men dropped in February and am

now ready .to announce the results.

The total number of men dropped
this year was only 88 as compared
with 135 last year. An analysis of this
smaller number of men shows never-
theless, and with an almost surprising
consistency of percentages, that every
‘conclusion I drew last. year holds

_ good and every appeal I made then’

needs/to be emphasized ‘again.

In, February, 1910, that is, among

‘non-fraternity students one man in

approximately every’ thirty students
was dropped, in; February, .1911, one
man in approximately every 53.
February, 1910, among fraternity
students one man in approximately
every 17, in February, 1911, one man
in approximately every 26. Or, to put
the same facts in another -light,‘ which
shows how little the percentages for
the two years vary, in February, 1910,
the fraternity men, who constituted
but,‘31 per cent. of the total‘ number
of men in the undergraduate courses
at Ithica, furnished 44 per cent of all
who were dropped as failures, while

In

in February, 1911', the fraternity men
who constituted but ”29 ;per cent of
the total number of male undergrad-
uates, furnished 45 —per cent of those
dropped.

That is not a good showingifor the
fraternities. However, as. I pointed
out last year, there are great‘; differ-
encesamong fraternities in this mat-

ter of scholarship. Again I am glad:

publicly to commend those fraterni-
ties which did not lose a single man
for poor scholarship. Fifteen fra-

ternities are in this “_honor roll” for“

1911, and they are the following: ‘ 3

Alpha Zeta,‘Bandhu, Cerebrus,  I

Phi, Delta Chi, Delta Phi, Kappa Psi,
Nayati, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Sigma

Kappa, Psi Upsilon, Sigma Nu, Sig-U’
Sigma, Theta.’

m.a Phi, Sigma Phi

Lambda Phi.

Seven of this list, namely, :Al~pha< I
Zeta, Mandhu, Cerebrus, Delta C'hi,j’

Delta Phi, Kappa Psi and Nayati, ap-
peared on.the corresponding list last
year.
upon remaining in the roll of honor;

and the other eight I congratulate it

upon getting into it! May ‘they all
be found upon the roll next year!

Worthy, of special mention are Psi.

Upsilon which with a chapter roll of
4.0 men, the largest chapter at Cornell

this year, lost» not a singleman, and j
Delta Phi, ‘the only, fraternitygwith ,

thirty ormore men in its chapter

both in 1910 and ini1911 which lost ._

not a single man.
