House votes six-percent increase for Pitt

Pete Brasko lll

Staff Writer

The state house of representatives Monday
voted unanimously to give the University of Pitts-
burgh $100.3 million in the upcoming fiscal
yeah

The appropriation amounts to a six-percent in-
crease over last year. Pitt officials had asked for
a 25—percent increase over the current fiscal year
or $118.7 million. .

Pitt Vice President Bernard Kosobosky called
the house bill ”generous,” but apparently felt
the appropriation was low, because he also said,
”there will come a time when the legislature and
the administration recognize the research ac-
tivities of major universities in the com-
monwealth.”

The appropriation to Pitt was part of a series

of bills passed by the house which will make up
the state's 1986-87 budget. The proposed ap-
propriation now moves on to the senate.

Other major state universities, such as Penn
State and Temple, also received six-percent in-
creases in state funding.

Earlier, Governor Thornburgh had recom-
mended_an increase of four percent in state fund-
ing. He then adjusted that upward to an amount
nearly identical to the house total when he an-
nounced a larger than expected state surplus.

The chief difference between the governor's
recommended appropriation and the house's ap-
propriation is funding for special undertakings
at major universities — known as ”differential
funding." The bill, which passed the house Mon-
day and was authored by Democratic leaders,

gives slightly more money than the governor's‘

proposal, but eliminates his plan to give money
for differential funding.
Under Thornburgh’s plan, Pitt would have

received $99.4 million, but $1.9 million would
have been set aside for biotechnology and
neuroscience research. The house-passed bill
would provide a total of $100.3 million, but
none for differential funding. The idea of
eliminating the funds earmarked for differential
funding was recommended by a gubernatorial
commission that studied the financing of higher
education. ' ,

Some house leaders think the measure will
easily pass the senate. House Higher Education
Chairman Ron Conwell said he believes the
house appropriations will be passed by the
Republican-controlled senate.

Many Pitt students probably will not be hap-
py with the bill, since tuition may increase
substantially. Pitt President Wesley Posvar
warned in March that adoption of the senate plan
could cause ”substantial” tuition increases. The
trustees are slated to meet to discuss tuition next
month. -

In the past, while holding down tuition in-
creases as much as possible, the administration
has been forced to make up the bulk of the dif-
ference between the appropriation it requested
from the state and what it got by raising tuition.
lfthis policy holds, it could mean a tuition hike
of as much as 19 percent, the difference between
what the administration asked from the state and
what it will probably get. The senate’s appropria-
tion is usually nearly the same as the house's.
At press time, no administration officials were
available for comment.

The legislature has until July 1 to approve the
budget bill. .

Other institutions benefitting from the ap-
propriations bill include: the University of Penn-
sylvania, Lincoln University, Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic, Carnegie Museum, Buhl
Science Center, PittsburghCleft Palate Center
and the Home for Crippled Children of
Pittsburgh.

Dean search is almost over

Dirk Kaufman

Sta ff Writer

Provost Roger Benjamin an-
nounced Monday that the search for
a medical school dean is about to
end. ”The finalists have been chosen
and we are in the negotiation stage,”
said Benjamin.

Benjamin made the announcement
at the June university senate meeting.
The search has been underway for
two years, and appointment of the
new dean may end criticism Thomas
Detre, health sciences vice president,
has been receiving for the lengthy
process. Benjamin did not give any

names of the potential finalists.

The provost gave the _report in
place of President Posvar who was in
a meeting with the board of trustees.

Delays in the approval of money
from the commonwealth continue.
Benjamin said that the fiscal year
1987 budget from the com-

"' monwealth of Pennsylvania has not

been acted on yet.

’’I have to say that the. Democrats
have put together an alternative
budget which overall would give $1
million less than the governor's ver-
sion,” Benjamin said. ”We’re work-
ing hard with our legislative friends

Greek advisor Bridgette Gurnsey
has filed a request with the judicial

affairs office for a hearing to deter-

mine punishment for the misap-
propriation of funds by Bruce Mon-

to make sure we have parity with
Penn State and Temple.”

The same day the House approved
$100.3 million for Pitt. The
Democrat's version was passed, and
1.9 million (originally earmarked for
biotechnology and neuroscience
research) was removed from the
budget proposed by. Governor
Thornburgh.

Reviewing recent announcements
issued from the university, Benjamin
said that the Titusville campus would
remain, although there will be im-
mediate investigations to change the
mission of the campus. The ad-
ministration decided to keep the
campus rather than transfer it to Penn
State. .

’’I apologize for the anxiety and
concern, [although it was] justifiable,
the colleagues in the community
there have had,” he said.

Benjamin also made an official an-
nouncment to the senate concerning
the departure of Vice President Jack
Freeman, who is to be the new presi-
dent of the University of Maine.
”He’s going off to Maine,” said
Benjamin. .

”As I said recently, I think we can
wish him, genuinely, all the best,” he
said, ’’because I don't think Pitt meets
directly with Maine in academic mat-
ters, nor do they have Division I foot-

ball.’’

The faculty involvement in the ap-
proval of the new University Honors
Program and reorganizfion of the
School of Education was lauded by
Benjamin.

’’They don't get paid for ad-
ministration like some of us on this
side of the table, but they are very
responsible citizens and have given
very constructive reviews,” said

Benjamin.

The ”Campus of the Future” pro-
ject has been put on hold by the
strike at AT&T. The question was rais-
ed as to whether the university would
maintain this fiscal year's budget with
AT&T should the strike carry through
into the next fiscal year. The question
was referred to Vice President
Freeman who. said that he was not
sure of the circumstances of the con-
tract and would look into the matter.

The student members"of the coun-
cil were not present. Senate President
Barbara Shore said that there had
been a problem with attendance by
students in the last few meetings and
attributed it to a high turnover in stu-
dent leader positions in the past year.

Shore said that the problem would
be looked into and that it was impor-
tant to maintain a fami|y—like relation-
ship between students and the
administration.

sour, president of Phi Gamma Delta _ Brldget Curnsey’ Creek advlsor

and secretary of the Greek Executive
Council.

According to Gurnsey, Monsour
falsified a university document which
allocated him $80 for trophies,
changing the amount to $180. He

« ; also failed to transfer $350 collected

from FIJI fraternity members for dues
to the Inter-Fraternity Council.

Gurnsey filed the request after
discovering the misappropriation
while reviewing budgets at the end
of last term. The request was filed at

the end of April.

Members of other fraternities in the
Greek system allege that Monsour
used the $350 for a party held at the
FIJI house.

Monsour is not on campus for the
summer and was not available for
comment.

Gurnsey said that no action will be
taken at this time by the judicial
board, since a student must be

registered for classes before he or she
may face a hearing. The hearing will
probably be held this fall when Mon-
sour returns. Within certain param-
eters, it is up to the student to deter-
mine when the hearing will be held.

Other members of the fraternity ex-
pressed surprise when questioned
about the hearing, and none of those
contacted were aware of any wrong-
doing on Monsour’s part.

The proposed reorganization of the University of
Pittsburgh School of Education was not strictly an
attempt to deal with budget cutbacks, but an effort
to centralize and streamline the education depart-
ment, according to Dean of Education Thomas
LaBeHe.

”The administration decided it was time to look
to the future and to look at its academic programs
to see where they could be improved," said La
Belle.

”The School of Education was especially
scrutinized because of the decrease in school
enrollments and consequently the demand for
educational professionals,” said La Belle.

”Schools of education at universities like this grew
up in the '60s and early '70s when there was a great
demand for education professionals. So there was
a lot of hiring of faculty, and they increased their
size dramatically. Then enrollment began to drop
off and teacher demand was not there. The School
of Education had to go through a reorganization
period,” he said.

I La Belle believes that the goal of reorganization
IS to attain a more coherent, more efficient and more
effective school.

The reorganization, effective July 1, reduces the
current 16 academic programs and departments to
one conglomerate with five educational units. La
Belle said that the five units can capacitate the
school's needs, and that this centralization will pro-
vide for more quality control and will eliminate
redundancy in the curriculum.

A decrease in the number of faculty members will
be one result of the plan, but La Belle estimates that
it will take five to 10 years before that happens.

”At the end of five years, we will not be ap-
preciably smaller, but we will have a new critical
mix of faculty who have been socialized to balance
their professional life with both research and
scholarship, as well as a commitment to educational
practice,” said La Belle.

The university plans to reduce the School of
Education's budget approximately 25 percent, ac-
cording to La Belle. He stressed that the cuts are
still enabling the school to harness new resources.

”A major research university has to have a com-
mitment to creating knowledge," La Belle
commented.

Flood damages cause
dispute with claims

Christopher Capra

For The Pitt News

A large flood in Litchfield Tower C
on May 27 damaged dormitory
carpets, ceilings and many of the
residents’ personal belongings. The
flood began when a chilled water
line valve on the twelfth floor burst,
soaking many of the floors below it
and leaving over an inch of water in
the lobby.

According to Bob Robinson, assis-
tant director of housing, the valve
broke because of a large amount of
pressure in the line: ”Tower C is at
the end of the line_ for the chilled
water system. The system runs
through all the towers, gains a lot of
momentum, and as it approaches
Tower C reaches a high level of
pressure. It can be compared to a
roller skater at the end of the line on
a whip.”

The incident occured around 11
a.m., and it took maintenance crews
between 20 minutes and ‘/2 hour to
respond and shut off a larger pipe on
the twelfth floor, according to
Christine Bogdon, a twenty-year-old
junior who resides in Tower C.

’’I heard a big pop and an intense
rush of water. A minute later, water
was rushing down the stairs, and
water came streaming down my wall,
over my books and desk. It left over
an inch of water on my floor as it con-
tinued gushing,” she said.’

”Twenty minutes is not a bad
response time,” said Robinson. ”You
have to figure that it probably took
five to 10 minutes before it was even

noticed, and another 10 minutes to
get an engineer up there to turn off
the system. Twenty minutes is not
bad time at all.”

The day of the incident, the
residents were told to make a list of
their damaged belongings and sub-
mit it to the housing office. The next
day, however, they were told to sub-
mit their lists to their parents’ in-
surance companies for compensation
under homeowner’s and rental
insurance.

”This was an unusual event. We
weren't sure how risk management
[the department that handles these
types of situations] was going to re-
spond to it. So we thought it logical
to tell the residents to submit lists of
their claims. Then, when we talked
with the insurance people, they said
the best way to proceed at the time
was through homeowner’s and ren-
tal insurance,” said Robinson.

Those residents who do not have
access to homeowner’s and rental in-
surance must have a letter submitted
by their parents stating that they do
not have it. Robinson said, ”We’|l
look at their claims and see about the
best way of handling it.” Robinson
does not know how this will effect
the refunding of deductible fees paid
by parents who have homeowner’s
coverage. __g .,_

Robinson said the faulty valve is in
the process of being replaced, or has
already been. The tremendous odor,
which led many students to believe
that the flood was caused by a break
in a sewage pipe, has almost com-
pletely dissipated. The only thing left
to resolve is the compensation issue.

Fast Lane

It seems that many Pennsylvania drivers can-
not drive 55. Several weeks ago, a bill to raise
the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit on the Penn-
sylvania turnpike was introduced to the Penn-
sylvania State Legislature. It was defeated, but by
such a small margin that there will be another
vote sometime in the upcoming weeks.

Proponents of an increased speed limit argue
that it is slow-moving drivers who cause ac-
cidents. They claim that gas is now so inexpen-
sive that we can afford to drive a bit faster.
Because the turnpike is a state-owned road and
receives no federal funding, these people feel that
it is our right to travel as fast as we want. Their
final point is that nobody ever goes 55 anyway.

What's the hurry? We've had a 55-mile-an-hour
speed limit for over 10 years, and statistics show
that traffic fatalities have gone down. Gas con-
sumption has gone down, which has, in turn,
brought gas prices down. Why ruin a good thing?

There is some truth to the proponents’ claim
that nobody travels at 55-miles-an-hour on the
turnpike. In a survey conducted between July
1985 and January 1986, 87 percent of the drivers
polled said that they travelled at a rate of speed
greater than the speed limit. Ifthe speed limit is
raised, will drivers continue to exceed it? Will
fatalities increase? Will gas consumption increase
dramatically?

Part of the reason for the energy crunch of 1973
was this country's irresponsible use of fossil fuel.
We had a lot, we used a lot. Now that there has
been a lull in the storm, car makers are produc-
ing more and the public wants to go faster.

We should enjoy the lower fuel prices and the
lower fatality rate. An increase in the speed limit
on the Pennsylvania turnpike would only bring
back problems that have haunted us during the
last decade. Don't allow a few in our state
legislature to reopen wounds that took so long
to heal.

Why need is not a claim

Our nation's founders believed that
individuals have three basic rights
which governments must recognize
as inviolable if they are to govern
legitimately: ”life, liberty and the pur-
suit of happiness." Some individuals,
citing the right to life, believe that the
government should guarantee
everyone’s survival: If one needs a
job, an education, a house or medical
care, the government should provide
it. This position may sound appeal-
ing, but here is where the trouble
begins.

Everyone has needs. Everyone has
rights, and with these rights go cer-
tain responsibilities. The right to life
means that one is responsible for
one’s own welfare. The government's
responsibility is to enforce laws
which protect the individual from
those who would deal with him
through fraud or coercion. Other-
wise, the government would violate
the very rights we want it to protect
—- it would become what we want it
to stop. Forcing one person or group
of individuals to aid either another

. person or a different group — no mat-

ter how needy they may be — is a
violation of their liberty, i.e., their
right not to be coerced. (Criminals,
by coercing others, lose their right to
liberty, but this is the only exception.)

The advocates of ”need is a claim”
may then counter by saying, ”No one
should be permitted to enjoy surplus
wealth when so many are in need.”
Unfortunately for their argument, en-
joying ”surpIus wealth” (whatever
that means) comes under the heading
of ”the pursuit of happiness.” Depriv-
ing someone of their surplus wealth
violates that right.

Consider the only essential dif-
ference between a criminal and a
socialist: the criminal conducts his
share-the-wealth program on his
own, while the socialist wants the
government to perform the robbery.
(The attempt to portray Reagan as a
”Robin Hood in reverse" is most
amusing. The only rich people Robin
Hood robbed lived off taxes, and the
only poor he gave to were taxpayers.)
Referring to such use of force as
social justice does not change the
facts at all; ”two wrongs don't make

a right,” especially if the first was not
a wrong to begin with. The socialist
argument is also spurious on practical
grounds. As Buckminster Fuller
noted, Malthus was wrong: Wealth
is creatable and, therefore, need not
be forcibly redistributed. (The only
valid argument for making the rich
pay more taxes is that government's
function is to protect property, and
the rich, by definition, have more
property to protect.) ‘V

Since most of us have the ability to
produce something someone else
needs, we can meet each other’s
needs through trade on the free
market. Any other system would con-
tradict our belief in equality under the
law by affirming that only some peo-
ple have truly inviolable rights. Those
who say that need is a claim are real-
ly saying, ”Give me what I need, but
don't ask me for anything in return.”
This makes them guilty of their
favorite charges against businessmen
and consumers: greed and egotism.
Recognize them for what they are,
dear reader, and hang on to what is
rightfully yours.

Good Stuff/Christine Curcio

A fiasco at Point State Park J

I thought I'd be the last person in
the city to advocate a cancellation of
free concerts during the Three Rivers
Arts Festival. But on the evening of
June 8, I happened to be in.
downtown Pittsburgh waiting to
catch a bus, when the concert of R&B
group ”Rene and Angela’' ended at
Point State Park. After that ex-
perience, I'll never feel quite as safe
at night at the arts festival.

As reported on the news, police
moved in and tried to clear the con-
certgoers out of the city as fast as
possible —— a necessary thing to ac-
complish. But the authorities ignored
an important point: You cannot
disperse a crowd of several thousand
by just telling them to "move along.”
I saw many people standing, waiting
for their buses. Ironically, police
blocked off the clogged intersection
of Fifth Avenue and Smithfield Street
with a paddywagon, which made it
impossible for the buses to get
through.

Once the police arrived, it was

 

literally panic in the streets. Just as I
attempted to get to a safe corner, I
was confronted by an attack dog. A
woman screamed at the policeman
leading the dog because it had come
within a few feet of her son. I found
myself running from the police along
with the others, not knowing what
could happen next. I avoided getting
trampled by the stampede by hiding
in a tiny alcove next to McDonald's,
which was mysteriously closed. For
the first time in my life I truly felt
vulnerable and threatened by a situa-
tion. There was no place I could go
for safety, and no one there to help
me. By the time I wasisafely aboard
my bus, I was shaking uncontrollably.

Why did this have to happen?
News reports stated that police had
trouble controlling the crowd until at
least 11 p.m. No one predicted that
90,000 people would turn out for the
free concert. Though I had wandered
onto Smithfield Street unaware of a
potential riot, I saw quickly that the
scarcity of buses on a Sunday night

helped to light the fuse. Even if the
concert planners predicted that half
the 90,000 would show up, couldn't
someone have had the foresight to
call PAT about increasing the bus ser-
vice? There should have been a fleet
of buses standing by when the con-
cert was over. It would have meant
safety for the many.

But the mistake has already occur-
red. In the history of free concerts at
the Point, this is a depressing repeat
performance. For the past two years
these shows have ended in violence
because, the crowd went out of con-
trol. Judging from my own ex-
perience, I don't think that a large
number of people can_ be effectively
handled without someone getting
hurt or being terrorized. Violence of
some sort seems to be inevitable. I
hope that this serves as fair warning
for all who intend to go to the up-
coming Smokey Robinson concert
(scheduled for the closing night of the
arts festival) very carefully, before
something tragic happens.

Counterpoint/Cecile Hecker

 

t No health clinics

In the June 4, 1986, issue of The
Pitt News an editorial entitled ”Pro—
tection,” and an article, ”Sex and the
Single Teenager,” by P. Gregory
Anater, said essentially the same
thing: There is a teenage pregnancy
problem in Pittsburgh, contraceptives
given out in school-based health
clinics will alleviate the problem, so
let's put clinics into the schools.

A problem has been diagnosed,
and a solution to that problem seems
available. What could be simpler?
Why the controversy?

Everyone accepts the fact that there
is a serious teen pregnancy problem
in Pittsburgh and that something must
be done quickly. Where the contro-
versy arises is that many
knowledgeable and concerned
citizens do not buy the reasons given
(lack of sex education, inaccessibili-
ty of contraceptives and blaming of
parents) for funding another worth-
less solution. Those reasons are
incorrect.

The solution to the problem of teen
pregnancies is very complex, and the
answer to the problem does not lie
in the establishment of school-based
health clinics. These clinics are inef-
fective, are dangerous to the physical
health and emotional well-being of

our teens, will foster promiscuity, can _

cause the breakdown of family rela-
tionships and lead to genocide of the
black community. «

In a quote from an editorial

published in the May 17, 1986, New ‘

Pittsburgh Courier, the editor said,
”Once again, the black community
has been targeted for control,
decimation and "ultimately the
destruction of black family traditions
and black life. And it's happening
right here in Pittsburgh.  the task
force was formed under the guise of
combatting infant mortality and has
since shiftedfocus to its hidden agen-
da, school-based birth control clinics.
Again, the primary targets of these
sex-clinic operators are black
schools.”

A front page article printed in the
June 10, 1986, issue of The Pitts-
burgh Press said the following: ”The
recommendations of the school dis-
trict's Task Force on Adolescent
Pregnancy and Parenting which were
presented to the board yesterday
recommends: The establishment of
one or more health centers in high
risk areas of the city, located within
the schools or in areas contiguous to
the schools.” (Note: high risk areas
are in the black community.)

It is impossible to go into depth, in
this one article, about how all the
previous, well-documented conclu-
sions were drawn. However, I would
like to share my views about three
particular areas: placing the blame
where it belongs, why school-based
clinics should not be funded and
what can be done. .
Placing The Blame Where It
Belongs:

Parents did not single—handedly
cause the unwed teen pregnancy pro-
blem. Parents have been made the
scapegoats by Planned Parenthood,
sex educators, abortion providers, the
YWCA, the Urban League, the March
of Dimes and several other organiza-
tions. Parents have been used by
these groups in a well-financed, pro-
fessionally conceived and carried out
nationwide program to push their
anti—family, anti-life agenda and ex-
ploit our teenagers.

Since the '70s, when so-called sex
education experts ”generally
assumed that most parents do not
know how to educate their children
on human sexuality" (Greater Pitts-
burgh Conference on Sexuality,
March 17, 1979), and the ”experts”
took over, the teen pregnancy rate
has steadily climbed and is now
rampant.

Value-free sex education programs,
and easy and confidential access to
contraceptives furnished by our tax
dollars and donations have failed
miserably. The following is a quote
from The House Select Committee on

Children, Youth and Families, 1984: ‘

”Now after nearly a decade-and—a-
half of this policy, it seems that there
has been no change in the percen-
tage of sexually active teens who
become pregnant but there has been
a huge increase in the percentage of
teens who are sexually active. And
this increase has led to a propor-
tionate increase in pregnancies to un-
married teens.”

Even the largest provider of con-
traceptives, Planned Parenthood, in
its own journal, Family Planning
Perspectives, acknowledged that the
increased availability and use of con-
traceptives has not reduced teenage
pregnancies: ”More teen-agers are
using contraceptives and using them
more consistently than ever before.
Yet the number and rate of premarital
pregnancies continue to ‘rise/’

Dr. Robert Kistner of Harvard
Medical School said, ”About 10
years ago, I declared that the pill
would not lead to promiscuity. Well,
I was wrong. The birth control pill
has been a major causal factor in the
rapid increase in both venereal
disease and cervical cancer among
adolescents by stimulating higher
levels of promiscuity.”,

Planned Parenthood was able to‘
push its plan for health clinics main-
ly because of the willingness of the

press to publish excerpts from a
report entitled ”Teenage Pregnancy
in Developed Countries: Deter-
minates and Policy Implications.”

A critical review of this study done
in 1985, by Robert C. Marshall,
director of research for American Life
Lobby, in cooperation with the
Castello Institute of Stafford, showed
this report (put out by the research
[branch] of Planned Parenthood, the
Alan Guttmacher Institute) to be
”biased and flawed by assumptions,
oversights and mistakes in
methodology.”

. School-Based Health Clinics Should

Not Be Funded:

School-based health clinics will fail
to reduce pregnancy, abortion and
VD because, like the programs of the
past, they are based on the assump-
tions that birth control devices will
reduce pregnancy, that abortion is a
safe back-up, that sex education can
be taught value-free and that teen-
agers are unable to control their sex-
ual urges. These clinics address a
symptom (pregnancy) rather than the
underlying causes (breakdown of
communications and teen-age
morals). .

Because current sex education pro-
grams and the distribution of con-
traceptives do not reduce teen-age

pregnancy, Planned Parenthood
recommends abortion as a means of
reducing unwanted pregnancies.
School-based health clinics are the
last ditch efforts of these people to
hang onto their access to our
children. The end results will be
higher abortion rates among unmar-
ried teens. The abortion providers
will be the ones that will make a
profit.

According to a special report on
school-based clinics done in 1986,
by Barrerr L. Mosbacker: ”There is no
means of verifying clinic data. Those
who have a vested interest in the suc-
cesses of the clinics are also respon-
sible for reporting its effectiveness.
This clearly represents a conflict of in-
terest and causes all unverifiable data
to be suspect.”

Mosbacker [continued]: ”All
research has been unanimous in
citing abortions as the only factor_in
recent years which has reduced the
fertility rate among teen-agers.”

School-based clinics represent a
duplication of current health services
at considerable cost to the tax payer.
The initial cost is estimated at
$30,000 per clinic.

Also, will the tax payer be respon-
sible for law suits brought by students
or their parents for wrongful birth or

Page 5

death of babies due to the failure of

the contraceptives, or for possible
physical or emotional damage done
to the students or members of their
families from the traumas of abor-
tions? Who is going to pay the bills
for long-term effects of a VD such as
herpes? ‘

What Can Be Done?

1. Join the Coalition for Parents
Rights, a group of concerned citizens
working to stop the Pittsburgh school
board from voting in school-based
health clinics. Write to your school
board representatives and let them
know that you are opposed to this
move. For more information, call the
Family Forum at 561-8687.

2. Stop allowing Planned Parent-
hood and its supporters to dictate sex
education policies to our communi-
ty. Don't think you are safe if you live
in the Pittsburgh suburbs. These,peo-
ple have as their goal a ”health clinic
in every school system in this coun-
try.”

John Kippley, president of the
Couple-to—Couple League of Cincin-
nati, Ohio, said, ”One of the best
things that could happen to this coun-
try would be for all levels of govern-
ment to stop spending even a dime

for birth control and specific sex‘ .

education.

Art Institute students draw caricatures

‘ Michele Kiraly

Sta ff Writer

his year's Three

Rivers Arts Festival

offers art lovers a

variety of abstract,
realist and surrealist paintings and draw—t '
ings. Scattered amidst the artwork you
will also find about 18 students repre-
senting the Art Institute of Pittsburgh who
are on hand to draw caricatures.

Robin Neville, a visual communications
major at AIP,'describes exactly what a
caricature is: ”It’s a drawing that plays up
to the facial features of people. I usually
play up to one feature and make it funny.
A caricature is how a person would look
if he was in a comic strip. It makes you
laugh/'

Neville became interested in this type
of drawing because her boyfriend was a
caricature artist.

”I wanted to learn how to draw
caricatures, so I took a class with John

Johns, an instructor at the art institute,”
she said.

Neville explained that the instructor
chose the best students to work at the
festival by examining their classwork. The
students work about seven hours a day,
and most will work all 17 days of the
festival, which runs until June 22.

One artist, who calls himself J.P., said
working at the festival is a good way to
earn money. ”We keep 60 percent of
what we take in from the caricatures,” he
said. ”The other 40 percent goes to the
Three Rivers Arts Association.”

J.P. is currently a senior art major at In-
diana University of Pennsylvania. He at-
tends AIP through an exchange program
with IUP.

He said Saturdays are long and tiresome
at the festival. ”I draw between 100 to
I50 caricatures a day on the weekends.
But I love it, it's great work,” he said.

The heat also bothers some of the
students. ”I get tired because the heat
wears me out,” Neville said. ” But I en-
joy drawing caricatures, and I thought this
job would be fun and it is.”

 

A first year student at AIP, Rich Haas
has spent nearly seven hours each day at
the festival since it opened. ”I love it
here. It’s a great way to earn extra money

‘for school. The people are nice; it’s really

a great job,” he said. ”On the average, I
draw between 30 to 40 caricatures but I
never get bored.”

His office consists of two folding
wooden chairs, one for him, the other for
his subject. He also has an easel on
which he creates the cartoon—like
representations of people using black
markers and a sketch pad.

’’I love to draw but it's not only draw-
ing that I’m doing here. I can ease the
tension from school through this. I'm hav-
ing fun but I'm still working.”

. Michael Warren, a second year student
at AIP, also said working at the festival is
more than just a fun time.

’’It gives me a chance to show off my
drawing abilities, and I can represent the
art institute,” he said.

Warren said that the artists set up shop
”wherever there's a space.” He chose to
sit near a sidewalk leading to Point State
Park.

”It’s close to traffic here. A lot of peo
ple are passing through this area. They’ll

The Pitt News, June’ 18, .1986

notice me sitting here and hopefully
choose me to draw them,” he said.

Warren draws with two types of
black ink markers, a chise|—point marker
and a bullet-point marker, for variety in
line thickness. He said the students pur-
chase their own materials for the festival
work. B

”I came to the festival last year and was
really interested in caricature drawing, so
I took a class at the school. Now I really
enjoy doing this and I would love to g
come back next year,” Warren said.

Carla Tobis chooses to do her work in
the shade of a willow tree. ”The first two
days I was here I got a bad sunburn, so I
bought a straw hat and suntan lotion,”

' said Tobis.

”It’s good to get out and talk to people,”
she said. ”The best part though, is the
practice I get from drawing. Everyone I
draw is different - everyone has different
facial features.

”You’reforced to draw the entire face
in about three minutes. So, you learn to
use loose lines and you also learn more
about the structures of the face.” ‘E ,

Despite the sun, Tobis would like to 3-
come back to next year's festival because,
she said, ”I love it here.”

blasphemous.

Such critics have completely
missed the point. The music of The
Pogues is a loose and lively inter-
pretation of the traditional which
makes no claims of folk authentici-
ty. lnstead, with its current American
club tour, the band has introduced a
new musical hybrid to a fascinated
and receptive audience.

To coincide with the tour, MCA
has unleashed upon American ears
two-thirds of The Pogues’ three

previously available only as imports.

The Pogues is an eight—member
band of English and lrish men whose
original moniker was Pogue Mahone.
That phrase means ”kiss my ass” in
Gaelic, and it aptly describes the at-

‘; titude of The Pogues. The band has
a legendary reputation as rowdy pub-
dwellers given to sloppy but impas-
sioned live performances in the tradi-
tion of fellow countrymen, The
Faces.

-.b§_i r3s.ﬁ2s_§t—._ ... ..

But The Pogues contrast sharply

with The Faces, who, like most
English bands of their era, pillaged
the distinctly American musical form
of rhythm and blues. The Pogues
have instead drawn upon the tradi-
tional folk music forms of the Irish
and the English, and possess an in-
strumental line-up which includes a
tin whistle, banjo and uileann pipes,
but excludes electric guitars.

What separates The Pogues from

folk purists like The Clancy Brothers
is the thrashing intensity of the band's
performances that originated with the
group's infatuation with the British
punk explosion of 1976-77. The
Pogues adaptations of traditional folk
pieces such as ”The Gentleman
Soldier” and ”Jesse James” have
enraged many purists who believe
The

Pogues’ versions are

female member.

Rum sounds like nothing you have
heard. From the rollicking blast open-
ing the album, ”The Sick Bed of
Cuchulainn,” to the tale of utter
resignation ending it, ”Waltzing
Matilda,” The Pogues drag the
listener through a gut_ter—level view of
the seamy side of life with a graphic
detail that could make Tom Waits
blush. In under one hour, singer
Shane MacGowan reflects upon
evenings when he, spewed up in
church, got syphilis ‘in a French
brothel and was kicked in the balls
by the Coppers. That does not sound
like the luck of the Irish to me. What
it does sound like is a soundtrack for
a frenzied and depraved lifestyle that
you can share with Shane and The
Pogues without the onset of a wick-
ed hangover. A

However, there are moments on
this album when the wine and ale
stop flowing. At the core of Rum
there is a deep sense of bitterness and
regret best expressed by ”Waltzing
Matilda.” This lengthy ballad tells the
story of an Australian soldier who

This complicated plot full of
deceiving and deceived characters
unfolds over the course of more than
two hours to reveal a series of
humorous and comedic episodes.
This British farce, basically well writ-
ten and highly entertaining, could use
a bit of editing. The large 13-member
cast of colorful characters does a
commendable job, but their affected
English accents sometimes only hint

. at authenticity. Well worth the drive

to rural Delmont, the play is staged

in the ’60’s and ’70’s, Dream Girls
is thought to be a parody of the rise
of the Supremes to stardom, but Ben-

nett denies this. He can see the
similarities but is quick to point out
the differences too.

Whatever the case, the musical is
so replete with hit songs like, ”And

capture a white audience. It relies
heavily on innumerable costume

steady movement of the show’s story

Schwarzenegger's latest thriller is no raw deal

Before I start discussing Raw Deal,
let me make one thing clear: I think
that Arnold Schwarzenegger deserv-
ed an Academy Award nomination
for his inspiring performance in The
Terminator. You probably think I'm
on drugs or something, but even
though he only had four lines, he was

perfect for the part. In his latest effort,

he may be on the other side of the
law, but he's still one tough hombre.
SO tough, in fact, that his box office
competition, Sylvester Stallone, in the
wimpy Cobra, pales by comparison.

Although Raw Deal does have car-
nage by the ton, it is not just another
Rambo clone. There is one Rambo-
inspired scene for all you diehard
fans. But for the most part, the movie
revolves around an intricate mob-
land plot.

Take Schwarzenegger as Kaminski,
an ex-FBI man who was axed from
his job for some unknown reason.
He's now a small-town lawman with
a bleak outlook on life. Throw in a
buddie seeking revenge on a mob-
land boss, and instantly a position for
our hero reopens.

This job is no cakewalk. Kaminski
must infiltrate the family infrastruc-

ture of the biggest Mafia in Chicago.
His smug grin and brawny build

quickly win the respect of the boss, .

Pavorita (Sam Wanamaker), as well
as a pretty lady, Monique (Kathryn
Harrod).

The boss knows where Kaminski’s
talents lie, and quickly puts him to
work as a hit man. Schwarzenegger
is much more than a trigger puller;
his brains help him to score big with
the boss, as well as give the oppor-
tunity to get his crack at revenge. The
story gets a little carried away with
the revenge kick though. He not on-
ly gets a chance to do what he was
hired for, but also gets to do a little
one-man jury duty when he en-
counters the guy who originally
kicked him out of the FBI. What it all
winds down to, predictably, is a big
shootout in which Schwarzenegger
sports the latest in heavy artillery.
Raw Deal is the first release from De
Laurentis Entertainment Group, and
it is obvious that they were looking
for a good start with Raw Deal. But
come on guys, why ruin a good
movie with such blatant capitalism?

Raw Deal asks a lot from its au-
dience, but in return you get a stylish

and entertaining film. Schwarzeneg-
ger again comes through with a
sparkling performance. His bulk and
brain combination provides just the
balance his character needs. Calm
and confident, he takes command of
the screen. In between rubouts,
Schwarzenegger finds time to charm
the lady, making the transition quite

accent that's a thousand miles from
Italy, he is a believeable gangster.

Even if this movie does not turn
you into a devoted Schwarzenegger
fanatic like me, it is still a fast-paced,
highly inventive story amidst the
senseless entries from his contem-
porary, Stallone. Watch out Sly, he's

. Walk The West:

Otherworldly noises from the North

Chris Zurawsky
Staff Writer

In Buffalo, the hip crowd is bless-
ed with a 4 a.m. closing time, the fan-
tastic Continental Club and
everybody’s favorite ”Go to a Party
 band, the Fems. This combina-
tion beats anything Western Penn-
sylvania has to offer and then some.

The Continental is a throbbing two-
story mass of blazing video screens,
cheap bottles Of Canadian beer, a se-
cond floor Halloween dance hall and
a backyard courtyard custom-made
for hanging out. It is located
downtown, away from the wrath of
stiff-necked neighbors and law en-
forcement officials. It combined the
warped intimacy and nuclear fallout
ambiance of the Electric Banana with
the overall floor space of Grafitti, and
threw in a few good reasons to save

‘ your seat between bands.

Wrapped within the layers of this
scene-sanctuary was a larger-than-life
group of performers. They have the
kind Of evil presence that cleanses the
soul Of all virtuous intentions and
generates a lot of fun.

I've never seen a group like the
Fems before. Bob, the vocalist, is a
combination of Iggy Pop, Patti Smith

‘and Mark E. Smith, with some

choreography and a glare to put the
best posers to shame. He was just this
side of cliched but confident and
disgusted enough to pull it off, even
without his front teeth.

Crazy Ted Nugent-leads, scream-
ing from a pick-up laden Les Paul,
combined with Jesus and Mary Chain
rhythm/distortion slashings and a
bass guitar, strangled through a bank
of special effects, created a holy hell
of funky noise and music. It wasn't
hardcore or rock ’n’ roll; it was Other-

worldly; it was heaven.

The Fems have concocted a bizarre
and successful mixture Of covers,
commentary, insight and insanity that
completely dominates Buffalo. For
better or worse, Pittsburgh does not
possess a band of that magnitude.
There's a gap between dance and
discourse and fan allegiance around
here that ultimately rips the stitches
out of many worthwhile musical
endeavors. A huge, receptive and
diverse crowd turned out for the
Fems; unfortunately, we don't have
that kind of magnetic band or cool
club to focus on.

Of course, Pittsburghers in search
of variety and creativity in their
musical diet have a fertile source of
protein right here at home. Rather
than one group dominating the
scene, we have many bands sharing
the spotlight and the loyalties. Few

Cactus World News: Years Later

Have you heard the Cactus World

discovered a gold mine in his home
town of Dublin, and that they may
be, maybe. Predictions of this type
are difficult to make on the merits of
a single single. ‘

lncidently, Cactus World News
does not sound very much like U2
at all, but it is easy to see what im-
pressed our favorite Irish rock star
about the band. Complex, yet catchy,
”Years Later” wields a raws sonic
power reminiscent of U2 a few years

Back to basics, non-rock pop
pioneer (pre—Sade) Tracey Thorn is
eating up the apathy in popular music
with this rock’em-sock’em, knock

soothing and sensual singing became
lost in music that failed to comple-
ment her unique vocal abilities.
Much of the material sounded like a
colorless swirl which featured
everything but the girl.

”Eating Up the Cold,” though,

unique blend of Latin jazz and

Assistant Sports Editor

Lee McRae, Pitt's All-America
sprinter, has won almost every ma-
jor race he has competed in this year,
and now he can proudly say that he
is the best in the nation.

Last Thursday night at a banquet in
Philadelphia, McRae was ‘the male
recipient of the second annual Jum-
bo Elliott Awards. The awards are
presented to the outstanding. male
and female collegiate track athletes
of the year.

Juliet Cuthbert, a senior sprinter
from the University of Texas, was the
female winner.

Winning the award capped off a’

remarkable year for the 20-year-old
from Pembroke, N. C. McRae cap-
tured both the indoor and outdoor
IC4A and NCAA sprint titles, won the
Penn Relays I00-meter crown and
the Athletics Congress indoor na-
tional championship. McRae was
also the recipient of the Jim
Herschberger Award, given to the
most valuable performer in the 1986
NCAA Division I Men's and
Women's Indoor Track and Field
Championships.

In those indoor races, McRae broke
Carl Lewis’ world record of 6.02 in
the 55-meter dash with an amazing
6.00.

For The Pitt News

Jim Zdelar’s high school dream of
playing football at the University of
Pittsburgh was put on hold last year
because of academic ineligibility. But
the All-City, A|l—Midwest linemen
from Rayen High School in
Youngstown, Ohio, is not a man who
is held down easily.

As a freshman, Zdelar, 6-6, 280,
was nothing more than a fixture on»
the Panthers’ sideline while he
watched his teammates experience a
[reality that has yet to enter Zdelar’s

I e.

’’It was always one of my dreams
to come to Pitt,” said Zdelar. ”So
when I got the chance to do it, I took
it. I'm glad to be here.”

But life was not what he once
dreamed it would be while playing
football for the Panthers. Combining
dedication to both his football duties
and classroom work was difficult.

”It was hard back in the begin-
ning,” commented Zdelar. ”But now
I've learned to adjust to it and I'm
back.” ,,

The new coaching staff at Pitt is
very happy to have him back on the
squad. Pitt head coach Mike Gott-
fried is known for his love of a wide
open offense, and offensive line
coach Mike Solarivrealizes the need
for talent in the trenches for the Pitt

passing game to be successful.

”We’re excited to have Zde|ar,”
said Solari. ”Although we don't know
him real well because we're new, he
seems to be a real nice addition. He's
a real good-looking kid in terms of
athletic ability and in the weight
room.”

Sports

McRae has been such a consistent
performer that his coach at Pitt, John
V35V3rY, is getting used to it.
”Nothing Lee does surprises me,”
said Vasvary. ”He works very hard
for his achievements.”

The true magnitude of how great
McRae could be came into sight back
in April. At the Penn Relays in
Philadelphia, Steve Lewis, Pitt's

women's track coach and the sprint.

coach, told a reporter, ”We might be

’ looking at the fastest human in the

world.”

Imagine that — the fastest human
beingiin the world right here at the
University of Pittsburgh.

That kind of talk puts McRae up on
a level of achievement with some of
Pitt's greatest athletes ever, like Tony
Dorsett, Hugh Green, Dan Marino
and so forth.

McRae gives the university an
athlete to truly admire, and while his
career continues to blossom, so will
Pitt's track program.

What makes McRae so special to
his coach is his tremendous con-
fidence in his ability.

”When Lee won the I00-meters at
the NCAA outdoor championships
[in Indianapolis] two weeks ago, he
just completely dominated the field,”
said Vasvary. ”Outwardly he acts as
if he doesn't expect all this success,
but inside he knows what he is
capable of and he goes and gets it.”

Zdelar has expressed favor for the
rushing"game rather than the passing
game, but he is concentrating on
both styles of play in order to be
ready for Gottfried’s wide-open style.

”I kind of like running football
myself,” Zdelar said. ”But I can learn
throwing football. I'd rather be run-
blocking because I like going for-
ward, and I don't like going
backward as in pass-blocking.”

Going forward is something Zdelar
has been doing since his freshman
year. ”I had to sit out the fall term of
'85 and come back in the winter term

in '86," said Zdelar. ”I got a 2.39’

[grade point average] and that made
me eligible. Now I'm taking summer
courses to get my grade point average
up even higher. I have a personal
goal this season of starting in the fall,
but I also want to prove to myself that
I can do well in the classroom.”

Zdelar’s dream may begin to
become agreality when the Panthers
open practice on August I2 at Edin-
boro University.

Pitt fans will see a Panther team
with a revitalized attitude this season
that has carried over from Gottfried,
according to Zdelar.

”What we needed was discipline
and that's what we got,” said Zdelar.
”We had a down attitude because we
were losing [Pitt is 8-I2-2 the past
two seasons]. But now we have a
new coaching staff and everybody’s
attitude is back up.”

And while Panther attitudes soar,
Zdelar’s weight plummets. ’’I’m
down to about 273 pounds,” said
Zdelar. ”|’ve been slimming down
because they said they might move
me to guard. I've noticed an increase
in strength while my body fat percen-
tage is down. Last year-my body fat
was 19 percent and this year it's
around 12 percent.”

Pitt's Lee McRae can make aclaim as bing the world's swiftest human being.

But could he outrun a Panther?

Panther linemen hope to make amends for '85

Jim Zdelar (above) and
Mark Stepnoski (below)

Brian Cannings

For The Pitt News

Under new offensive line coach
Mike Solari, the tradition continues.
One man who is expected to play a
major role in the continuance of that
tradition is sophomore Mark
Stepnoski.

The University of Pittsburgh foot-
ball team has enjoyed an illustrious
history of producing first-class
linemen. The names Emil Boures,
Mark May, Jimbo Covert and the in-
comparable Bill Fralic speak for
themselves.

Stepnoski, a 6-3, 245-pound guard
from Erie Cathedral Prep, combines
natural talent and a dedicated work
ethic to prompt Coach Solari to call
him “one ‘of the best offensive
linemen in the country.”

Stepnoski knows that he has to
work hard for what he gets and is
willing to do so. ”Hard work is the
only way to get anything,” said Step-
noski. ”People who are lazy fall
behind.”

The Stepnoski work ethic does not
end on the football field either. Step-
noski was an honor student at Erie
Prep, as well as his first year at Pitt.
He has changed his major from
business to communications, and he
is elated about living in the city and
attending Pitt. ”I always knew that I
wanted to come here, and I am hap-

py to be here,” added Stepnoski.

In addition to attending class, Step-
noski spends much of his time in the
weight room getting an early start on
summer training camp, which begins

on August 12 at Edinboro University. ’

This will be the first summer camp
that Stepnoski will not be under the
instruction of former Pitt line coach
Joe Moore. Moore was the magnet
that attracted Stepnoski to Pitt,
developing a string of Pitt linemen
who now play in the NFL. Earlier in
his career, he coached high school

football in Erie for nine years and»

knew of Stepnoski.

Stepnoski was surprised when Pitt
made coaching changes, firing Foge
Fazio and his staff. He thought about
transferring, but Stepnoski has settled
at Pitt, comfortable with the new
coaches.

Moore, however, did not leave
Coach Solari empty-handed. All-
America candidate and potential first-
round draft choice Randy Dixon will
anchor the Panther line at tackle.
Along with Stepnoski,’ Dixon helped
to offset the loss of graduating
linemen Barry Pettyjohn, Mike
Dorundo and Tony Brown.

Are Stepnoski and the other‘

linemen ready for the season? ”We
never go into anything with a
negative attitude,” commented Step-
noski. Considering the Panthers’
schedule, a positive attitude is of
paramount importance.

Pitt has an attractive six-game
home schedule, starting September I
in a night game against Maryland, in-
cluding games with highly touted
Miami of Florida and a backyarl
brawl with West Virginia. 

Hopefully, these games will give
the fans an opportunity’ to see Step-
noski and his linemates continue the
‘Panthers’ tradition of excellence.

arena, they will be forced to play a
variety of positions.

"The type of player who will play
arena will be a better all-around
athlete than in the NFL," said Doug
Verb, who, along with Jim Foster, is
the creator of America's newest sport.
”...[He will] need to have the stamina
and courage to go the whole 60
minutes."

"A 250-pound lineman is going to
make it in the NFL,” observed Verb.
”But he has probably bulked up to
250' to play major college football.
Now he goes to his normal weight,
which is 235, while he is just as
strong, probably quicker, and he is
able to playboth ways in arena.”

The rules of arena, forced upon it
by the size limitations of indoor
stadiums, result in a wilder game than
outdoor football. Sixteen players,
eight to a side, will play on a field 50
yards long by 27 yards wide. Com-
pared to outdoor football, the goal
post crossbar is higher and the
uprights are closer together in arena
football. in addition, the goal mouth
(the opening formed by the uprights
and the crossbar) is surrounded by a
net, which will rebound the ball back
onto the field of play in the event of
a missed field goal, which will take
place in lieu of punts due to the
shorter field.

”A captain is a leader,” Apke said.
”You don't have to yell and shout
and scream. If you're in the weight
room working hard and you're run-
ning afterwards and if people see
that, then they're going to do it.
Sometimes you don't have to tell
people.”

An obvious change which Apke
and his teammates have had to ad-
just to is a new coaching staff. Apke
admits that although it can be difficult
adjusting to a new staff, the team has
made the transition fairly well.

One of the reasons for the coaching
change was last season's rather disap-
pointing showing of 5-5-1. But Apke

«feels that those losses are just the

catalyst needed to turn the '86 Pan-
thers into the teams of old.

Each team will carry 18 players and
four taxi squad mambers for a total
of 22 players per team. With each
team needing 10 to 12 players a
game, 22 roster players will be more
than enough.

Player salaries will be determined
on a base pay, with bonuses award-

. ed for team victories and personal

achievements. The base pay will be
the salary for a player on a winless
team who doesn't play a single
down.

This salary format will have the ef-
fect of making the players give total
effort, even if the season is over from
a playoff standpoint. ’’If a team is
hopelessly out of the playoffs, you get
a pretty good idea that players maybe
aren't going all out,” said Verb. "If
they go out there [the field] knowing
that they're going to make more
money just by playing and by win-
ning  it’s going to help the com-
petitive nature on that basis.”

’’It’s also going to keep the teams
from bidding for players against each
other since there won't actually be

any negotiating between the teams .

and the players." All salary (and most
other) decisions will be made from
the league's central office,
presumably in Chicago, which is
where Foster and Verb have their
offices.

”Anytime you lose, you're going to
remember it," Apke said. ”The last
two years I remember pretty well and
it's not too enjoyable. You
remember, and you feel a grudge a
little.’’ Apke, however, is quick to
point out that those things are better
left in the past.

The changes occurring in the pre-
sent are of much greater significance
to Apke and his teammates.
Foremost, especially for a defensive
player like Apke, is a change in
defensive strategy —— from 5-2 to 4-3.
Apke feels good about the new
system and says he enjoys it because
it's something different. ,

Pitt fans will beable to see Apke
playing this new defense in an attrac-
tive six-game home schedule that

Arena will not be organized as a
league as much as a corporation, ac-
cording to Verb. "Investors will buy
shares of stock. In return, they will be
given the exclusive marketing and
management rights to a team in a par-
ticular city. In addition, they will be
given a fully funded football team.”

”That person will sit on the board
of directors and make the decisions
for the league  What this set up
does, rather than the franchise system

‘ which plaqued professional sports, is

take away some of the renegade
ownership, those owners who say
’I’m going to go out and spend twice
as much money as anybody else just

III

to win a championship.

The free-spending owner forces the
other owners to spend money to
keep up. This problem has hurt the
USFL and the MISL. Foster and Verb
know this well, having worked in the
USFL and the MISL, respectively, and
it is this idea which is the center of
arena's claim of solid financial
backing.

In addition, the corporate system
will help keep the weaker teams
afloat. If one team folds, then the
whole league will probably fold. ”lt's
no different than General Electric_
having a subsidiary, like their motor
division, or a steam iron division. The

opens with a night game on Sept. 1
with Maryland and includes big
games at Pitt Stadium with West
Virginia and Miami of Florida.

Aside from playing football and
working out daily, Apke manages to
find time for other interests. He's
begun playing golf, a sport in which
he says he is slowly, but steadily, im-
proving. Apke also enjoys fishing, but
admits his most enjoyable activity is
returning to Cincinnati for visits with
his family. He especially misses his
brothers Joe, Pat and John.

Something else Apke enjoys doing
is spending time with children. He
has spoken at local grade schools and
often visits with the kids at Children's
Hospital.

For Apke, a very sobering, yet

director of that division has to pro-
duce. If he doesn't produce, he is not
going to be the director any more,”
said Verb.

Verb's opinion is that this system
will enhance the game. "The com-
petition will be on the field, not off
the field. The franchise situation,
where you get big egos involved,
they have a competition off thefield.
They should all be partners in the
same game. Someone who is doing
well in Pittsburgh should have a good
impact on someone who is doing
well in Cincinnati  The only com-
petition should be betweenjthe white
lines.”

The competition will certainly not
be with the NFL, "When Pete Rozelle
was on the witness stand [in the USFL
anti-trust suit] mentioned us as
something new that is coming about
and how they [the NFL] have en-
couraged us,” said Verb.

The prospects for a team in Pitts-
burgh are very good according to
Verb. "I think that the people
representing the DeBartolos, mainly
Paul Martha, are very encouraged by
the nature of the project, the type of
game. Paul has a very good football
background  and I worked with him
in the MISL [when Martha worked for
the now defunct Pittsburgh Spirit].’’

the times

enlightening, experience occurred
when Coach Gottfried made ar-
rangements for a group of Special
Olympians to visit Pitt Stadium. The
Panthers hosted a post—practice ses-
sion one spring afternoon at which
the Special Olympians got to ’’play
ball'' with the '86 Panthers squad.
Apke, reflecting on the visit and his
position in life said, "Sometimes you
know how lucky you have it com-
pared to other people. It just seemed
to put everything into perspective."

Pittsburgh gearing up for Great Ride in Schenley Park

On June 22, thousands of people
in the tri-state area will come together
to participate in Pittsburgh's biggest
biking event — the Great Ride. The
event is sponsored by The Pittsburgh
Press and CitiParks. The Western
Pennsylvania Wheelmen and the
American Youth Hostels will be mar-
shalls for the extravaganza.

The Great Ride actually consists of
seven events that start and finish in
Schenley Park. The courses range
from a 50—mile ride for experienced
riders, to a seven-mile ride for
novices. In honor of the event, Pitts-
burgh Mayor Richard Caligiuri has
proclaimed June 22 as ”Bicycling
Day.”

More than just a day of family-
oriented, recreational fun, the Great
Ride is also a day of giving. This year
the Great Ride expects to draw at
least 3,500 bikers to raise $50,000 for
the completion of the Marty Ostrow
Hematology-Oncology Center at
Children's Hospital. Along with the
$3 preregistration fee, donations col-
lected by the riders will. be given to
the center.

Great Ride celebrity chairman Liz
Miles will team up with a variety of
celebrities for the day's festivities. For
those of you who have dreamed of
tackling Jack Ham, now is your
chance. This time it's not on the
gridiron, but in the 50-mile ride from
Pittsburgh to Harris Hills Regional
Park and back.

The 50-mile event is designed for
riders who have ridden 50 miles or
more at one time and can maintain
a moderate to fast pace. The long-
distance riders will begin their ride
at 9 a.m. and are not expected to
finish until mid-afternoon.

Seasoned riders can traverse the
25-mile course that winds through
the streets of Pittsburgh. Riding at a
moderate to fast pace, this ride

should take the average rider two-
and-a-half to three hours to complete.
Steeler defensive back Rick Woods
will be riding on your team if you
enter the 15-mile ride. This leisurely
event is especially designed for new
riders who are going on their first
group ride. It starts at 10:45 a.m.
Liz Miles will be starring in the
seven-mile ride. This event is ideal for

families.

Younger bicylists will truly be
challenged by the intricately de-
signed bicycle obstacle course at
12:45 a.m.

Kids can flank former Steeler Ran-
dy Grossman in the all-terrain ride
through the horse trails of Schenley
Park. Participants must ride a wide-
tire bicycle to enter this five-mile
course which shifts into-gear at 1:30
p.m.

Mr. McFeely of ”Mr. Roger's
Neighborhood” will make one of his
patented speedy deliveries at the Big
Wheels Obstacle Course. Children
who are four to six, or seven to 10
can bring their three-wheel Big
Wheels to the Schenley Oval at 1:40

p.m.

At 12:30 p.m., there will be a break
in the action as Liz Miles introduces
the celebrity participants at the main
stage. Immediately following, local
band favorite Gigolo will tune-up the
day's festivities with live music. Ad-
ditional festivities include free

refreshments and, weather permit-
ting, hot-air balloons.

Prizes will be awarded to top fund
raisers in both the corporate and non-
corporate divisions.

All registered participants will
receive a free T-shirt. Registration

For The Pitt News

Summer is almost here, and Pitt
Stadium is, for the most part, empty.
On the track you will find people
running here and there. On the field
there is a lone figure kicking a
football.

University of Pittsburgh junior
kicker Mark Brasco spends most of
his days practicing alone. Kicking is
considered by many to be the Ionliest
position in football. When a field goal
or extra point is missed, the kicker
usually shoulders the blame alone.

The former Jeannette High School
kicker’s first two years at Pitt were not
what he expected. Many thought
Brasco would kick for Pitt as con-
sistently as he did with the WPIAL
Champion Jayhawks. Coach Foge
Fazio attributed this to trouble ad-
justing to college, but Brasco
disagrees.

’’I don't think I had any trouble ad-
justing to the college game, because

when I first came here I started out
very well,” said Brasco. ”My fifth
game of my freshman year - the first
game we won in 1984 —-— I missed
two long field goals and that's when
he [Fazio] thought I couldn't adjust.
Before that I felt very comfortable. I
started out fast, and I don't think I had
a problem adjusting.”

It did not get much better for‘

Brasco or the Panthers in I985.
Brasco lost his starting job to Pat
Viancourt early in the season. Some
thought Brasco’s poor start was a
result of his losing confidence. ”I
don't think my confidence was a pro-
blem last year. I just thought I had
bad luck in the early going,” said
Brasco.

Despite past problems, Brasco is
spending the summer trying to im-
prove himself. He spends two hours
every Tuesday and Thursday kicking.
On Monday, Wednesday and Friday,
he works out in the weight room and
then practices his kicking for an hour.

Brasco’s efforts this spring have not *

gone unnoticed by the new coaching

staff. ”Mark is kicking major league,”
said assistant head coach Chuck
Klausing. ”He has a live leg and ex-
cellent distance on field goals. He
was in a slump last year, but we think
that his rhythm is perfect now.
Hopefully his problems are over.’k’
With new head coach Mike Gott-
fried at the helm, Brasco and the rest
of the Panthers are anxious to see
what 1986 has in store for them.
"I think everybody just wants to get
out and prove we're better than our
record shows,” Brasco said. ’’I think
the new coach definitely has the pro-
gram going in the right direction.”
Both Brasco and Gottfried are look-
ing forward to the start of summer
camp (August 12 at Edinboro) and the
regular season beginning with a night
game at Pitt Stadium against the Ter-
rapins of the Univesity of Maryland.
Brasco arrived at Pitt in 1984 and
saw the team go 3-7-I his freshman
year and 5-5-1 last year. .Although his
first two seasons have not gone as
well as he expected, Brasco still ap-

pears grateful for what he has. One

way he expresses his gratitude is by
giving speaches.

’’I like to speak,” Brasco said. ’’| en-
joy it. I think it's good experience to

Brasco—kicking the habit of missing his shots

get out and speak in front of people.
If you have something to share and
you know you've earned it, and they
want to hear you talk, you can at least
give it back.”
