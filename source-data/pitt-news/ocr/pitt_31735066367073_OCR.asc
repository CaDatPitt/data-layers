UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Scranton Affirms
He Will Not Become
Next Chancellor

By FRED FRANK

No, no, a thousand times no was the theme of Gover-
nor William Scranton’s response to the possibility of him
becoming Pitt’s Chancellor. In an exclusive interview with
The Pitt News the Governor explained, “It has been mu-
tually agreed upon by. the University administration and my-
self that your next chancellor should be someone with an
- academic background.” ‘ I

When it was noted that Acting Chancellor David Kurtz-
man’s background was not in the academic world Scranton
responded, “Well he is only acting chancellor. But that’s not

Literature
Censorship

By ROBERT ZAVOS _

While passing out anti-ROTC

literature in the Towers lobby to
orientation students last Tues-
day, Students for Peace President
Bill Weber was approached by a
Towers administrator and‘ told
to stop.
According to Weber, this con-
stituted a direct violation of a
printed “Towers Policy” issued
on March 14 which states, “stu-
dents will be allowed to distri-
bute personally literature in the
lobby at any time."

The controversy arose from
Students for Peace’s questioning
of ROTC’s status on this cam-
pus. ‘_‘If the ROTC program is
considered an academic discipline
it has no right to recruit students
during orientation since no other
academic disciplines are allowed
to recruit students to their pro-

T grams,” noted Weber.

Students "for Peace has said
that they will continue to distri-
bute literature during future ori-
entation sessions.

After the incident several mem-
bers of the group approached
Helen, Pool Rush, dean in charge

of student affairs, and asked her_

tp schedule a meeting of the Ori-
entation Committee in. order to
discuss the issue. A date was set,
but later Miss Rush cancelled
the meeting after polling other
members of the committee.
Students for Peace contem-
plated further action by bringing
up a resolution at a Student Gov-
ernment meeting held last Sat-
urday. _
, In other action at last Thurs-

“days meeting, Students for Peace

expressed concern about a letter
sent out by Acting Chancellor
David A. Kurtzrnan to all future
freshmen. Brieﬂy, the letter wel-

, clomed the students to the Uni-
~ ‘ versity and told them of the «many
, advantages of joining ROTC.

 
   

.;a~ si_mi1a.r manner

Earl Trent, a member of Stu-
dents for Peace and the Hill Ed-
ucation. Project, suggested‘ that
“perhaps Dr. Kurtzman might be
good -enough to personally re-
cruit for other worthwhile or-

 ganizations‘ such; as the Hill Ed-
. '__uc_ation Project or

meant as criticism of him. I
think he's doing a ﬁne job.”

State Sen. Albert Pechan (Rep.,
Ford City), a University trustee,
had originally suggested Scran-
ton as a candidate for chancellor.
The Governor admitted he had
never asked Sen. Pechan why he
made the statement. However,
Scranton said that Pechan was
probably doing a “little headline
hunting.”

“I’m not going to settle on a
job for sometime,” continued the
Governor. However, he doubted
whether he could “sit still” for
more than at year. I

On the drive to make the Uni-
versity state-related, Scranton put
the blame for the slow up at the
feet of the House Democrats. He
felt that they are gumming up
the works because of their re-_
fusal to settle on a general ap-
propriations bill. ‘

He said ‘the slow-up was not
the fault of the Senate Republi-
cans because they must wait on

passing the Pitt appropriation un-’

til the general appropriation is
settled.

By DAN BOOKER
At least six legislators will
return to their legislative
duties in Harrisburg today

A and tomorrow, having given

the 1University students

strong assurances that a bill
concerning University state-re-
latedness will be law before the
end of the year. These assur-
ances which were given at a spe-
cial‘ / rally, Friday, were, how-

ever, accompanied by more b'uck- p

passing between the State House
and Senate and by a controversy
over the role or student pressure
on the speed of legislative deci-
sion making.

Sen. Leonard Staisey, Demo-

STATE sENA'1voit Leonardstaisey addresses the student rally held

cratic candidate for lieutenant
governor, was not sure state-re-
latedness would be a fact before
September, but he was conﬁdent
that a'bill to this affect would
be passed before the end of the
year and that students would re-
ceive rebates for their fall ex-
penses.

None of the other senators or
representatives who attended the
rally or sent statements to be
read at the rally offered deﬁnite
assurance that the University
would be state-related before the
fall. Rep. Harry Markowitz of
Squirrel Hill said that “it takes
time —— a long time — to get
enough people to agree on an is-
sue.” He also remarked that the

Search for Dean

A “group management” arrangement for the administration of
the Division of the Social Sciences, with Dr. Hibberd Kline sewing
is acting dean, has been established, according to Dr. Charles Peake,
vice-chancellor for the academic disciplines. The formation of the
special Administrative Committee was necessitated by the resignation
of Dr. Richard Park as the dean of the Social Sciences.

The members of the Administrative Committee will include’ the
chairmen of the departments of anthropology, sociology, history, po-
litical science, economics, /and geography. Dr. Kline, who is also the
chairman of the geography department, will chair the committee.

Dr. Peake also noted that a Search Committee to ﬁnd a new
dean has been constituted, and has been placed under the direction
of Dr. Edgar Hoover, professor of economics. The immediate mission

[of the committee is to identify candidates for the deanship and, to

prepare appropriate ‘dossiers on
the possible candidates.

Other ,members of the Search
Committee include Dr. Kline;
Robert Avery, assistant professor
of sociology; Dr. Richard Cottam;
associate professor of political
science; Dr. John’Gillin, resident
professor, of anthropology; Dr.
Carter Goodrich,. Mellon profes-
sor of history and economics; and
‘Dr. Marina Whitman. assistant
professor of "economics.

controversy over who is respon- _
sible for the delay in action “is '
just one of the partsof the legis-
lative process.” 1'

Sen. Robert Fleming, chairman
of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, assured the students. 7
at the rally that he was conﬁ-
dent the Pitt legislation would. 1
pass. He also noted that the cur- A
rent ﬁght over the General Ap-
propriations Bill, which is caus-7‘,
ing the block in action, shows
signs of being resolved.

In prepared statements, Joshua
Eilberg, House majority leader,
and Sen. Albert Pechan, a Uni-I ,
versity trustee, exchanged accu-; 4
sations ‘for causing the lack Of. ‘
results" on state-relatedness. Eil-‘ -
berg said the inaction of the Re- _
publican Senate was “absolutely
inexcusable,” while Pechan
stated that “as long as the Demo-.
cratic House is under Philadel-
phia leadership, the question as
to when it (state-relatedness) A ,
will be officially done is up in V
the air.” '

Rep. Leroy Irvis, from the Hill
District, is a sponsor of theﬁoiise,
state-relatedness bill,,but he 
that real action will not be taken.
on the House or Senate bill until-.
a great deal of pressure is put '
on the legislators by students and
by their parents. In his’ remarks,
Irvis said that he was “disturb-’
ed” by the turn-out at the rally .-
and that he “saw more students’ .
walk bythan walk into the ral- H
1y.”V There were approximately“
150 students attracted to the‘:
rally. ’ F

Sen. Staisey stated that the?
generation of a great deal ,of..
pressure by students “is not par-7i

sponsibility of the men in the legs-. 
islature” to pass. the Pitt bill and‘
“no blamei can be put on tlieg
students” for not applying pres-
sure or for the ‘delay. continue

students, and that the problem.

problem now is how to resolve -

One “pitfall”,in the Pitt legis-if,
lation which was noted by the’
legislators is the lack of agree-‘~
ment on cutting tuition for part-' )-
time students. Irvis, Fleming, and‘
Staisey said they favor a'tuitio‘n ;
reduction for all students but‘.
that there is_ some opposition

part-time students. This coul

Students Thanked

For Contributions
Editor, The Pitt News:

I have been receiving regular-
ly a copy of The Pitt News. It is
a great comfort to me to read of
the students and student organi-

zations who have made contribu-
tions to the Memorial Fund in

memory of my-husband. I real-
ize that many of these gifts rep-
resent a real sacriﬁce on the part
of students. ‘

I hope that somehow they real-
ize that not only am I personal-
ly grateful, but also that the es-
tablishment of this fund is a
means of carrying on the quality
of life to which my husband was
devoted.

Thank you and your fellow
student for all that you have
done in this project.

Mrs. Stanton C. Crawford

Football Game

Seating Questioned
Editor, The Pitt News: _

I realize that this letter is a
little premature, but I feel that
the time for action is now. I re-
fer to the reserving of seats for
fraternities at the’ Pitt football
games. At three different games
last year, I was asked, I should
say told, to move my seat be-
cause “it was reserved for a fra-
ternity.” On each occasion I re-

fused to do so and was threaten-'

ed with forceable ejection.

On each occasion I had arrived
at» the Stadium at least one hour

before the fraternity boys and

had taken my seat before any
“reserved sign” was visible. I
realize that the fraternities want
to sit together but is it neces-
sary to reserve seats for them
whilethe rest of us slobs fend
for ourselves? I say NO. If the
frat boys want to set together
why don’t they come to the Sta-T‘
dium early and ﬁnd a block of
untaken seats? Is it really nec-
essary to rudely tell a fellow
student to move?

I urge action be taken to in-
sure the right of every student
to have his own choice of seats
at the games. All we hear any-

more ,is charges of student apa-
thy at Pitt. Can anyone blame a
student for not attending the
sporting events when something '
as foolish as fraternity reserved

K State Rep.’ K. Leroy Irvis accused the student body of apathy and
it he was right in doing so. The attendance at a rally for state-relatedness
‘ G Friday was a mediocre 150 students. Mr. Irvis is a friend of Pitt and was
_ deeply disturbed by the lack of student interest. But if he is intent upon
‘A 7 ﬁnding the reason for that apathy he might look no further than to his
fellow members of- the House and their colleagues across the hall in the

A What example has been set in Harrisburg by the legislators for the
students at. the University to follow? All have promised us that Pitt would
‘be a state-related institution by the time it opened its doors this fall. A
general tuition reduction to $450 per year for Pennsylvania students was
also set by the members of the General Assembly as their goal.

 _ tion for Pitt is caught somewhere in the middle of an incredibly complex

legalistic maze.
Legislators have clearly decided to make the. Pitt bill the perverbial

- nothing that prohibits the passage of legislation affecting the University
before the General Appropriations (for state operations) are settled.
The Governor of the Commonwealth has also called for the immedi-
ate passage of the Pitt bill, explaining’that it need not wait until the gen-
eral appropriations are completed.
But the Republican controlled Senate perceived a chance to use the
University crisis as an added force with which it could pressure the Demo-
cratic-controlled House to pass the General Appropriations Bill.

 

that they stagger the imagination of even the most adventuresome politi-
cal scientists. But when all the chaff is cut the reality of the situation is
clear. The ﬁght over general appropriations is a petty political battle that
one would have to expect in an election year. For students, Harrisburg sets
this example of unity. ‘ -

For dedication, students may also look to the State Capital. With-

Editorial: Harrisburg ls Greatl-Ixample  

in the last six month period, the legislature has actually been in session
slightly more than 30 ‘days. This past week the members of the General
Assembly showed their slavish devotion to chivalry when they recessed
for a week to permit the ladies of the Order of the Eastern Star to use
their hotel rooms for lodging during a state-wide“ convention.

‘For careful scrutiny of all possible aspects of a problem, the legis-.
lators have also led the way by completely ignoring the out-of-state stu-
dent at Pitt. To this day, not one legislator (or for that one University
administrator) has made it clear that out-of-state students will beneﬁt
from the proposed legislation. There are vague murmers that non-Penn-
sylvania tuition can not be more than three times higher than in-state
student tuition. Yet this possible reduction of out-state fees still remains
unexplained and unsettled. ‘

Mr. Irvis said he saw more students walk past the rally that walked
into it._ In all probability many of them were out-of-state students on their
way to lunch, out-of-state students cannot be expected to rally behind a
bill which they feel will not affect them.

Part-time students have equally plausible reason for apathy. The
Governor of their state has agreed to sign legislation that ‘beneﬁts only‘
full-time students. In the end many of the part-time studen-ts are the ones
who most crucially need a tuition reduction.

Often they are working their way through college and ﬁnd it impos-
sible to afford full-time tuition. Theywould greatly welcome a reduction
in their fees but now they have good reason. to doubt whether any will be
forthcoming. They too have good cause to walk by a rally for a bill that
very well may not help them either. . '

In the end, students are disturbed by the political machinations of
their legislators, dissappointed by their inabilityito remedy the situation
and depressed by the growing uncertainty of the times. Apathy? Yes, Mr.
Irvis. With the example that has been set for us, what elseicould you
expect!
