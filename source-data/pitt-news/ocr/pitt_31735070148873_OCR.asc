The sassy fashionista nicknamed
“Mister Jay” took the stage at Pitt
Tuesday night in ﬁont of more than
350 Pitt students. Some dressed the

delving into his upbringing, experi-

“We decided he would be aﬁin guy

who organized the event for P_PC. “It
was something different.”

Manuel, the son of a doctor and

had a passion for photography and

Former Pitt transgende studentfiles complaint withcity

By Em Maier 8: Andrew Shull
The Pitt News Staﬂ"

Seamus Johnston, a former Pitt »

Johnstown student, ﬁled a com-
plaint with the Pittsburgh Commis-
sionon Human Relations Monday,
a day before he testiﬁed in front of
a federal grand jury regarding the
99bomb threats that the University
has received this semester.
Johnston, who was born female
but lives as a male, commented
brieﬂy via email on his testimony,
maintaining his innocence and
again claiming that the Univer-
sity was unfairly targeting him in
the bomb-threat case because of
his status as a transgender indi-
vidual. ‘ ’
Last week, the FBI issued a sub-
poena to Johnston and his partner,

Katherine Anne McCloskey, 56, to _

provide ﬁngerprints, handprint-
ings and handwriting samples and

surrender their computers. But
Johnston said the couple will not
comply without a warrant.

Jerome Cochran, Pitt’s executive
vice chancellor and a member of
the Ofﬁce of General Counsel of the

University, previously conﬁrmed. .

that, in November, Johnston was
arrested for and charged with in-
decent ‘exposure, deﬁant trespass
and disorderly conduct after he
showered and changed in a men’s
locker room on campus.Johnston
has since been expelled.

The University received two
more threats Tuesday afternoon,
afterJohnston and McCloskey tes-
tiﬁed.

University representatives did
not respond to multiple requests
for comment, although previously
Cochran denied Johnston’s claim-
that he is being singlediout because
of his gender identiﬁcation.

“It is not uncommon for indi-
viduals who become the subject of
a criminal investigation to attempt

to shift responsibility to others.
Apparently, that is happening in
this case. However, the University
has engaged in no retaliatory be-
havior. Instead,ithe investigation
in question is being conducted
by the FBI in accordance with its
own standards,” Cochran said in
an email. -

While Johnston did not com-
ment on the complaint to the Com-
mission on Human Relations,- com-
mission Director Charles Morrison

conﬁrmed thatjohnstondid ﬁle a ‘

complaint against the University.

Morrison said that the Pitts-

burghcommission will have juris-

diction even thoughJohnston was a V

student inJohnstown, because the

, University’s policy regarding gen-

dered facilities is the same in Oak-
land as it is at branch campuses.
Morrison said that while John-
ston was the ﬁrst student to ﬁle a
complaint against the University,
he encourages anyone else who
feels discriminated against to come

-forward. ‘

“We believe people whose rights
have beenviolated should stand
up and ﬁght it, because otherwise,
nothing will change,’_’ he said.

Morrison said that while he
could not comment any further
on the complaint, which is con-
ﬁdential, he did outline the way
the commission‘ works. First, the
commission, which is made up of

-15 people appointed by the mayor,

seeks to resolve a dispute in me-
diation.

If that fails, the commission will
hold a public meeting that will de-
termine if a law has been broken
and if the act in question has the
force of law.

Morrison said that although the
commission can issue ﬁnes up to
$10,000 in cases of housing dis-
crimination, the largest amount
the University could be ﬁned in
Johnston’s case is “only $300.”

“It’s not signiﬁcant,” he said,
regarding the possible ﬁne. H

US senator urges federal
  officials to aid Pitt in P
bomb threat investigation

The Pitt News Staff

A U.S. Senator urged federal officials to aid
in funding investigative efforts concerning
the bomb threats received at Pitt.

A statement issued by Pennsylvania
Sen. Bob Casey’s press office Monday said
that he had written a letter to the U.S.
attorney general and secretary of Home-
land Security asking them to provide law
enforcement help, noting that attaining
resources — such as bomb—snifﬁng dogs
— put a financial strain on the local Pitts-
burgh community.

“Unfortunately, it appears that the situ-
ation has only escalated in recent weeks,
with more threats and no clear suspects
publicly identiﬁed,” the Democratic sena-
tor’s' letter said. “To help bring a swift
end to this situation and restore peace to
the University of Pittsburgh community,
I urge you to ‘direct any and all available

resourcesto assist in this investigation.”
Pitt’s bombﬁthreat count hit 99 Tues-
day afternoon, with threats received at

_ Chevron Science Center and the William

Pitt Union: .

Casey noted that he was thankful for
assistance in the investigation already
provided by the Department ofjustice and
Homeland Security, and he commended

- Pitt police for “working’tirelessly to keep

everyone safe.”

He said that his office has received
many phone calls from Pitt parents con-
cerned about events such as upcoming
graduation. '

“I believe ‘both the Department of]us-
tice and the Department of Homeland
Security have an important role to play
in an investigation of this magnitude,
and I respectfully ask that your agencies
supply any available resources that could
help ensure the safety of the University
of Pittsburgh community and alleviate
parents’ fears,” the letter said. I

SGB Allocations Committee
proposes recording three
precedents inmanual

By Pat McAteer
Staff‘ Writer

The Pitt Student Government Board Alloca— ‘

tions Committee has taken the ﬁrst steps
toward clearing up some of the ambiguity
that exists within its allocations process.»

Allocations Committee Chair Michael
Nites revealed a plan to revise the Alloca—
tions Manual to recordthree precedents
during Tuesday night’s meeting ‘at Nordy"s
Place '— the last SGB meeting of the spring
semester. '

“When things are precedent for so long,
I think it’s time to place them into writing,”
Nites said after the meeting.

The revisions to the manual would codify

' and record three previously undocumented

precedents set by the Board, including not
funding for B teams, not funding for stu-
dent group trips over spring break and the

precedent that says national competitions '

don’t count toward a group’s regular com-
petition caps. _
When it comes to granting funding from

the Student Activities Fund, the Allocations '

Committee makes recommendations to the

‘Board by strictly adhering to the manual.
-But in the case of these three precedents,

the Board could still break with the Alloca-
tions Manual. .
SGB President James Landreneau said

members would vote on the revisions — _

including adding precedents for club sports
and spring break funding — next week via
email. I

Board member Gordon Louderback

said the changes suggested by Nites would
provide “better guidelines” for student
~ groups. ' v ’
The spring break policy is. one of the ~

unofﬁcial precedents that would be docu-

mented. . V ' I . V .
The policy received attention earlier

this year after SGB denied ﬁmds for spring

break trips to Pitt’s club softball and baseball ‘

teams. The currently undocumented policy
advises that SGB not fund for a student orga-
nizatiorfs spring break trips unless they are
for national competitions. Nites’s proposed

If a bomb threat occurs during a tour, the
situation is not ignored by the guide.

McKinley said that Pathﬁnders _inform_

families about how the threats are dealt
with and have been encouraged to show
visitors the Emergency Notiﬁcation System-
alerts if any are sent out during a tour or at
a recruiting event. ‘

Boyle noted the important role law
enforcement has played in reassuring the
campus.

“We describe our appreciation for the

hard work of the‘Pitt police and the city of v

Pittsburgh police to keep us safe 24 hours
a da ',” he said. '

McKinley complimented the Pitt ad-
ministration on the cooperation that has
enabled the campus and tours to retain
some semblance of normalcy.

As far as maintaining students’ safety as ‘

they guide newcomers through University
buildings, McKinley said the Pathﬁnders

dedication to informing and educating

“Pathﬁnders are doing very well con-

deﬁnitely doing our job to stay positive on

Stephanie Melendez, 17, came from Vir-
ginia for a Pathﬁnder-led tour last week.

_ “I was surprised at ﬁrst, but at a school
with thousands of students, there’s always
bound to be a troublemaker,” Melendez
said. “Sure, my sense of safety at the school

Manuel also trained in classical piano and

and he jumped on board to produce the show
with Banks. l

The duo only expected “'I‘op Model” to run
for a few seasons; the showwill begin taping its

at New York University. Itwasthere that Manuel
started shooting photos forvarious musicians.

“Iwasaskedto do analbum coverfor Luciano
Pavarotti,” Manuel said. “My idol.”

After doingworkfor well-known opera stars
suchas Pavarotti, Manuel said, he built up apart-
folio and a good reputation in the photography
world. However, toward the end of his college
career, Manuel was diagnosed with a disease
in his back and legs that bound him to a wheel-
chair and required many months of therapy for
recuperation. .

“It sounds like a TV movie,” Manuel said,

laughing. “But I remember thinking, ‘What do ~

you really want to do here?”’

Although he was working toward a career ‘

in music, Manuel realized that his heart was in
the fashion industry —— speciﬁcally infashion
advertisement.

“I decided that I would get better, and when
I did, I would tackle the fashion industry,” he
said.

After completing therapy and leaving the _

wheelchairbehind, Manuel workedwith various
models both as a makeup artist and photogra-
pher to ‘create mock ads. He sent his work to.
different agencies. ~

“I really loved helpingpeople looktheirbest',”
he said, displaying photos of different models
and actresses he had worked with in the past.

Manuel met Banks, the mastermind behind
‘‘America’s Next Top Model,” when shehired

" him as her makeup artist. They became close,

Often Manuel gets to be a part of the scenarios
— he pulled up slides of photographs of him in
drag or dressed as a vampire.

V Through the show, Manuel gained intema—
tional recognition and explored more oppor-

I tunities in the television world, covering red '

carpet events and working for the Style and E!
networks. ' _

“I got to interview people I had worked with
before,” Manuel said. “I’d be standing on thered
carpet andjennifer Lopez wouldwalkby —— she
used to be my client.” vi

Manuel_advised the audience to market their
talents, no matter what the ﬁeld.

“Things are not cut—and-dry,” he said. “It’s
OK to change your mind, and it’s important to

H Senior Chrystin Bunion, who has held in-

fund trips during spring break.
Other suggested revisiohsto the manual

included a ban on funding for club B teams.

The revisions reﬂect the Board’s stance that

funding go toward “enabling” clubs —— the

. a, traditional belief among SGB members holds
that only funding toward A teams is consid-

ered enabling. . _ v
Similarly, the ﬁnal revision adds to the

, manual that national competitions don’t

nual cap, a precedent already followed by
the Board. . .'

Board member Halim Genus feared the
revisions could take power away from-the
Board’s ability to interpret the Allocations
Manual. _

“Right now, it seems like these should
be issues left up to the sitting committee
or sitting Board,” Genus said. “I think that
whether anyone agrees or not, the board

. interprets‘ the rules— based on the request.”

--?Board member Zoe Samudzi disagreed

' with Genus’ assertion and said the revisions

wouldsolidify those precedents.

. “This is formalizing and putting into
writing the precedent that they have set
for themselves,” Samudzi sai’d.

Agreeing with Samudzi, Landreneau said
the revisions reﬂected rules followed by the
current Board and those of the past.

“I can tell you that these revisions are not
something that has just been proposed over

a month period,” Landreneau said. “These

are rules that have been followed by SGB
and just aren’t on script.” V I

THE STAMATTACK

Good things happened at Pitt this year

By Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

4.2 degrees.

No, I am not talking about my
new boy band, promised to be at
least one—twenty-fourth as good as
98 Degrees. Instead, I am talking
about one of the facts that proves
this year didn’t actually stink.

4.2 degrees is how much
warmer this winter was than the
average Pittsburgh winter. You
might, not be aware of this, pos-

sibly because you might not have

known that winter even happened
this year. Your memory might be
weak because there were no crip-
pling blizzards, no long shots of
icy death from the arctic and, for
me at least, no compound frac-
tures from slipping down an im-
pressive ﬂight of four steps.

Yes, because of 4.2 degrees,
this year rocked. It might not
seem like a lot, but it was the dif-
ference between manageable cold
and Snow Miser’s basement.

This point, along with several
others, deserves to be remem-
bered, or at least. reconsidered,
before we write off this year as a
complete failure. Of course, there
was one big series of events that
might have put a damper on the
party for some, but plenty of small
things happened throughout the
year that have made 2011-2012 a
good school year nonetheless.

Consider Pitt football: Look-
ing at our record, I will admit it is
hard to call 2011-2012 a winning
year (actually, it would be a lie).
But moving beyond the record,
it’s quite easy to see this season
as a blessing; we lost a coach who
led the team to a mediocre 6-6
season without having to endure
further years of football medioc-
rity. Had we not lost him, every
year we would have had to predict
if Todd Graham would-get another
chance from Steve Pederson to try
to bring Pitt football to Dorsett-

level glory again. Inevitably, he ‘

would have failed: I,pdon’t know
howiianyone who breaks up over

just saved afew years andmany
countless hours of listening to
sports radio callers‘ talk about
how to coach college ball.

Greek Week Chair for Sigma Phi
Epsilon and brother of this writer,
says that there has been an in-

crease in interest in the Greek

community.

’ “A lot of the Greek Week events
were getting more crowded. Fra-
ternities and sororities are having
a lot of good fundraisers, too.”

If that’s not a quote from a
participant in athriving Greek
community, then I don’t know
what is. Because of this, and what
I perceive as an improving repu-
tation in general for the Greek
community, we can say this year
rocked for the Greeks.

On the artistic side of things,
I think there is a consensus that
Pitt’s Symphony Orchestra is the
best it’s been since I’ve been here.
And even if it’s not a consensus —
I don’t know if such a consensus
exists about these sorts of things
— at least I think so. The ﬂute
and cello sections in particular
have never sounded clearer. For
the ﬁrst time in my life, I ﬁnd a
violin section enjoyable.

Pitt Repertory Theatre has also ‘

had a spectacular year. Working
with the music department, mem-
bers put on “Sweeney Todd” this

year, a massive collaboration on a _

scale that hadn’t been attempted
in many years. Add to that this

the entire set of smaller student-
directed lab shows was great as
well, “Bedtime Stories,” which

was produced at the beginning.

of the year, stands out with some
spectacular performances.

Also, need I mention that Pitt
produced more Goldwater Schol-
ars this year than Carnegie Mel-

nia or Penn State?

But what we really have to re-

thing that greatly improved my
quality of life, and I assume the
quality of life of many other stu-

you that the old ones were disas-

COLUMN

By Abdul-Kareem Ahmed
:. Columnist

An undercover agent undergoes
an advanced medical procedure to
transform into the country’s most
wanted terrorist, allowing him to
inﬁltrate a criminal organization.
The procedure: to replace his be-

, nevolent face with the chilling face

of the terrorist.
In 1997, Hollywood offered this

unthinkable premise of a full face‘

transplant in the ﬁlm “Face/Off”.
After the procedure, John Travol-
ta, playing an FBI agent, assumes
the persona of a terrorist master-
mind, played by Nicolas Cage. The
transplant was at the crux of the
plot. Confused identities, strained
emotions and novel psychologies
resulted — not that Cage needs a
transplant to convince us that he
is borderline.

The Hollywood theatrics have
translated into the surgical theatre,
and face transplants are now ac-
tually being performed by plastic
surgeons across" the country, even
on our own campus. The Shock
Trauma Center of the University
of Maryland Medical Center per-
formed the ﬁrst full face transplant
in America just recently, accord-
ing to The Washington Post. And

as with the majority of scientiﬁc ‘

advancements, this new opportu-
nity brings with it new questions
and considerations.

Face transplants are performed
for people with facial disﬁgurement.
Trauma, burns, diseases and birth
defects can all result in disﬁgure-
ment. The process of ﬁnding a
donor is a complicated one. There
must be a medical match to reduce
tissue rejection, a structural match
to mimic the patient’s face and an
agreement with the donor’s fam-
ily, as the donor is typically either

Face transplants a realit

. deceased or brain-dead.

Even with all the public’s in-I

_ terest in this new medical ability,

there is still an aspect missing from

- the conversation. Other consider-

ations, like the possibility of result-
ing psychological issues, are often
overlooked in the excitement of the
science itself. Though Hollywood
exaggerated the consequences,
“Face/Off” gives us a hint of what
we already know about medicine:
psychology is always a consider-
ation in every medical treatment
and procedure. This holds true for
face transplants as well.

Organ transplants and psychi-
atric treatments have been around
long enough for relevant psycho-
logical considerations to develop
in the public’s mind. Psychologists
and philosophers have had enough
time with these treatments to of-
fer physicians and surgeons aless
hard-scientiﬁc aspect to consider.
For example, in the case of organ
transplants, recipients of organs
from anonymous or identity—pro—
tected donors-might always wonder
by whose graces they still live. Face
transplants are not simple organ
transplants, however, as anonym-
ity is impossible to maintain. This
procedure is new, and so such con-
siderations are sparse.

Alan Meisel, Professor of law,
psychiatry and bioethics at the
University of Pittsburgh, offered
insight on the different components
of face transplants.

“The technical aspects of facial
transplants are far more complicat-
ed than of other organ transplants,
and in addition, the aesthetics of
the result are paramount, whereas
in internal organ transplants they
are of little or no concern. Of course,
aesthetic considerations are also a
consideration. in the transplanta-
tion of limbs and ﬁngers, but of far
less concern.” ‘

“Theultimate
transplant
 is a head
or a brain
transplant.”
-A|ansMeise|

The title “plastic surgeon” of-
ten conjures up images of celebrity
makeovers and everlasting smiles.
However, plastic surgeons do not
only specialize in cosmetics. They
can alternatively specialize in re-
constructive surgery, which is the
specialty that face transplantation
falls under. Nonetheless, cosmetics

are still important in reconstructive _

procedures, such as face transplan-
tation. The results have an effect on
how people perceive the patient and

how thepatient perceives himself. _
' Even the idea of receiving some-’

one else’s body part is different for
face transplants than organ trans-
plants. A

“While psychological conse-
quences of transplantation are

. always a very important consider-

ation, in facial transplants, they are
critical,” Meisel said.

“A person who receives some-
one else’s heart may consider from
time to time that another person’s
death is responsible for their being
alive — on balance, they are usually
grateful for it even if they are a little
bit ‘freaked out’ by having someone
else’s heart beating within them.
However, with a facial transplant,

_the recipient is constantly remind-

ed that he or she has taken on the

y — not science fiction

external persona of the donor and
hasshed his or her own.”

Face transplants are not simple.
No medical transplants are. How-
ever, therepis something special
about thigprocedure. Men’s and
women’s ‘iifiagazines abound with
questions like, “What’s more impor-
tant, body  face?” The face largely
forms ,,one’s.-private and public iden-
tity. Ideologically, the word “face”
can sometimes represent dignity or
respect, like in the phrase, “to save
face.” We_can often remember a face
but not a name. Indeed, the face is
a central part of one’S. identity an
social persona. -

Another question this procedure’ ‘

probes is where the medical com-
munity is "headed next. Face trans-
plants are a remarkable feat and a
blessing foggthese unfortunate pa-
tients. What else can we expect?

“The ability to successfully
transplant. a face suggests that
even biggei:;acco_mplishments may
be in storelin the future,” Meisel
said. “The ultimate transplant —
indeed the stuff of science ﬁction
— is a head or a brain transplant.
However, for those students whose
grades are less than they’d like them
to be and contemplate this as a pos-
sible solution, wouldn’t hold my
breath.”

Indeed, such a transplant would
test the accepted standards of med-
icine. Our brains, and speciﬁcally,
our memories, which are encoded
within, afford us what we call our
personality and identity. This is why
Alzheimer’s Disease is so unfortu-
nate, as the patient loses memories
of who he is and to which family he
belongs._ -

Still, I’m always entertained by
the way science mimics science
ﬁction. I I I

By Greg Trietley & Dexter Gulick
Staff Writers ‘

A curling throwlrequires four
people. There’s the thrower, who

releases the stone; two sweepers, -

who reduce the friction between
the stone and the ice, and the skip,
who captains the team and deter-
mines strategy. ‘ V

Now meet Pitt’s club curling
team: Alex and Nicholas Vis-
nich.

Despite a shortage of players,
Nicholas, enrolled in the College
of General Studies, and his young-
er brother Alex, a classics major,
compete in curling tournaments
-— called bonspiels —- across the
East Coast. ' ,'

And the brothers manage pull
it off on their own.

“Over the past season, I think
we’ve had maybe four or ﬁve
[competitions],” Nicholas said.
“Within those four or ﬁve, we
probably have won gold in three
and bronze in one.” ~

A curling game pits two teams
made up of four players against
one another. The object is to slide
granite stones, known as rocks,

‘ across a board made of ice to get

the rocks as close to the center of
the circular target — called the

house —— as possible. In this way,

Bruter duo runs Pitt curling team

Team Canada’sjeffstoughton throws the rock in a. curling game. Pitt has a two-person club curlin mun.

the sport resembles shufﬂeboard.
The closer a rock stops to the cen-
ter of the house, the more points
a team receives, and whichever
team accumulates the highest
score by the end‘of a game wins.
To ﬁeld a full team for colle-
giate tournaments, the duo often
pairs with two female students
from the Rochester Institute of
Technology and competes under
the Pitt name. For local play, the
Visniches join with members
of the Pittsburgh Curling Club,
where practices and friendlies

‘ take place Saturdays from Octo-

ber to March. ' . -

“We haven’t necessarily ex-
perienced anything where we’ve
had to deal with a three-person
team,” Nicholas said. “But it’s of-
ten diﬂicult to match everyone’s
schedules.” q

As fragmented as the team’s
base might sound, ‘Nicholas,
the skip ofthe team, said that
Pitt’s program has a stronger
foundation than most schools’,
as he and his brother have run
the club for several years. Nich-
olas co-founded it when he was
a freshman along with another
curling enthusiast who has since
graduated. I '

sheveled that you can put together

he said. “We’re an extremely ag-
gressive team  We force a team
to do extremely tricky hits that
inexperienced teams ‘sometimes
can’t execute just because of the
level of difficulty.” '
But, for the Visnich brothers,
why curling? ‘ . ' ‘
The brothers’ ﬁxation with the
sport started when they watched
the 2006- Winter Olympics and
pulled for skip Pete Fenson and
the United States curling team to
beat Great Britain for the bronze
medal. A .
“Afterward, our mom found
that the Robert Morris sports

facility .— at that time it wasn’t -

even owned by RMU, it was just
like Neville Island Sports Complex
— [was] offering curling,” Nicho-
las said. “That was our ﬁrst time,
right after the 2006 Olympics.”

Six years later, Alex and Nicho-
las dedicate their time and money
in order to curl. The duo, and
whatever teammates it ﬁnds for
that spiel, must cover the tour-
nament’s entry fees and travel
costs. *

“In collegiate curling, no uni-
versity sponsors their own school,
so this is "all individual monéy,’.’

Alex said. “Everything is out-of- 2

  Ultimate team sets

The Pitt men’s club Ultimate Fris-
bee team entered the national
' tournament as a No. 1 seed last
‘season. But instead of winning a
championship, Pitt suffered a quar-
terﬁnal upset loss to the University
of Colorado at Boulder and ended
the year disappointed.
Enter Nick Kaczmarek.

The ﬁrst-year head coach —-

who played Ultimate for ﬁve years
at Pitt from 2005-2010 — is now
trying to irﬁpart his knowledge of
the game and -

to football with two end zones. - 

Afterscores, teams throw off ——
similar to a football kickoff —— to
begin play. _

Unlike football, intentional
contact is not permitted. Passing
is the only way the disc can trav-
el. There are no referees, which
means that players govern matches
themselves. Observers act as me-
diators between players of oppos-
ing teams.

Kaczmarek was quick to sepa-
rate his role from the team’s suc-
cess, describing his job as more
of an aide to the players. He said
he helps them ﬁnd the best way to
contribute to the team.‘

“It’s a sport that’s always been
very player-driyen  It’s a big
part of the growth of Pitt. The
players arethe team,” he said. “In
our sport in particular, everyone
is their own captain, their own
leader. It’s such a player-driven,
player—fueled-sport. That’s why the
team has been so great.”

Club sports teams compete with

. teams from other universities, but

their athletes aren’t on athletic

scholarships, and the teams aren’t
governed by the NCAA.

In Ultimate, seven players from

each team are on the ﬁeld at one
time. The game is continuous and

While En Sabah Nur competes
throughout the year, the fall se-

builds directly toward each stage of

and nationals.

En Sabah Nur already took the
ﬁrst step toward earning another

Team looks to usecliche in upcoming Do

Senior Staff Writer

You play to win the game.

. That’s why the teamwill look to bounce back
from its last loss. The task won’t be easyfor the
players, though, because they play a tough op-
ponent. It’s a game of inches, and the team that
draws ﬁrst blood will have the advantage.

Of course, the experienced opponent had
a choice: lose the ﬁnal game of the season and
play the struggling franchise, or win the ﬁnal
game and take on the Cinderella dark horse.
As the players said at the time, they didn’t care
who they faced.

Needless to say, they won, setting up a mar-
quee matchup. And there is certainly no love
lost between the inexperienced Cinderella team
and its tough opponent. No one is going down
quietly. ‘

It’s going to be aseesaw barn-burner; a nail-
biter of a showdown. Neither team will let this
chance slip away. .

“We’re not looking past them,” the oppo-

nent’s coach said. “We need to stay hungry.”
Down the stretch and with the playoff race
heating up, the team had aturning point. Itwas
gut-check time, crunch time. Sitting last in the
standings, the offense clicked and hit its stride.

blue—collar, no-nonsense coach said. “We want -
to run the table.We’re peaking at the right time.
Time was running out.”

The matchup against the opponent’s smash— ,

mouth defense will be crucial. It’s do or die and
forallthe marbles, and both teams are on a mis-
sion. Sights are set on the championship.

' The opponent’s defense will offer different
looks in an attempt to keep the players on their
toes. Neither program can afford any lapses in
this intriguing matchup, no question about it.

One key to the team’s chances will be to shut
down the opponent’s star player, who makes
it look easy. A heck of a player, he’s one of the
best — a scrappy winner, a crafty veteran and
a passionate leader.

The star said this week that his experienced
teamwilllook to avoid the upset. .

“We need to come together, control th
tempo and just play our game,” he said.

Earlier this season, the _star’s powerhouse
team came out alittle ﬂat to start a game, strug-
gling out of the gate. With no moral victories, the
team was out-hustled and out-coached, failing
to match its opponent’s intensity.

The star insisted thathis teammates have put
their defensive woes behind them.

“We came up short,” he said. “We beat our-
selves. You’ve got to hand it to them. They ﬁn-
ished plays andwe didn’t, butwe’ll put itbehind
us.”

The bumps in the road, though, were few

o

and farbetween, as the star’s team cruised to the
regular season ﬁtle. And although the underdog
tearnwill tryto slow the star, the opposition has
more than just one great player. .

“I couldn’t do it without my teammates,” the
star said. “It all starts with them.”

The team must also  its opponent’s X-
factor, who may declare early for the draft.

“He’s a steal,” one scout said. “His stock is A

tremendous depth. k

“We’re going to rise to the occasion,” a player,
who is having a career year, said. “We’re going
to rally around our guys. We’ve just got to make
plays and ﬁnish our chances.”

Ateammate said he’s proud to go onthis run
into the playoffs, especially for the fans.

“We came to play,” he said. “We brought our

He added that the players can be deﬁned in

ttlewith opponent

one word: resilient.

They’ve certainly had to be resilient during
this rash of injuries. A couple guys are banged
up and are day-to—day with lower-body injuries,
althoughthe no-nonsense coach refused to make
any excuses: , . ‘ .

This could be the last shot for the coach. He
wants to get the monkey offhis back and finally
win the big game. Still, his focus right now is on
his players. ~ A A _

“Everybody needs to stay focused,” he said.

“We’.ve‘shown good chemistry of late. We’re_ V

starting to gel. If we’re struggling, we’ll make
adjustments. Obviously we’ll take it one game
atatime.” ,

The up -tempo, run-and-gun, high-ﬂying sys-
tem, though', has let the team down and put the

players on their heels severalﬁmes  season.

- “I takethe blame for this one)’ the coach
said after one embarrassing upset’ last month.
“I thought the refs could’ve called some things,
but you_have to give credit to bothteams. It’s a
classy organization over there.sWe’llhave agoodl
practice and turn things aroun .” - E

The coach believes that with the recent hot
streak, the atmosphere in the locker room en-
tering the playoffs gives the underdog team an
advantage. .'  .. ~

“I think we have the edge mentally, psycho-
logically,” he said. “My guys have the heart. It’s
all about heart, aboutthewillto win.'That’s why
we put the work in.” I

year seniorjulian Hausman said he expects

Pitt’s region, the Ohio Valley, to receive one .

strength bid.

_ After falling to Colorado at Boulder 12-7
last year, Pitt ended the season tied for ﬁfth,
out of the 20 schools that qualiﬁed for the na-
tional tournament. This season, junior Zach
Kauffman said the Pitt men’s Ultimate team
knows-they are the best in the country.

The rankings back up his claim. The team
— with a 17-3 overall record —— is ranked
No, 1 among all college Ultimate programs
by USA Ultimate, the governing body for
Ultimate.
Hausman said that the success has ben-
eﬁted recruiting. - 5
_ “Each year that we perform well, it gets-
easier to attract recruits,” Hausman said.
“They know how good we are.”
A couple of weeks ago a potential player
came on a visit to campus from Oakland,

Calif. —— .a development that baffles Kacz- _

marek given the program’s roots. ‘
“[Coming from] when nationals wasn’t
\even an afterthought, [Ultimate] was just to
have fun and hang out with your friends,” he

‘ said. “It blows my mind.”

While success has brought respect, it’s
also raised expectations. .

Pitt’s Ultimate club team, started in 1998,
initially faced a lack of respect from the U1-
timate community because the team was
unproven, Kaczmarek said,.and that dis-
respect helped motivate the team. But the
‘disrespect has faded with the team’s success,
leaving the program-to look internally for a
new source of motivation. '

Kaczmarek said En Sabah Nur hasn’t
made that transition easily.

“In some ways I think the team may have
lost that chip on the shoulder. It’s hard to
keep it there,” Kaczmarek said. “We don’t
have that natural chip on the shoulder of

no one respecting us anymore.”

Newfound Commitment

Given thesefupr and scale of collegiate
Ultimate events, players often have to shuffle
their schedules around practices and com-
petitions, much like varsity athletes. Senior
captain Colin Conner acknowledged short-

. comings in the team’s approach to the sport

last season. _ .

“We deﬁnitely before tried to just rely
on our talent rather than put the work in,”
Conner said. :

The issue came down to time manage-
ment, Kauffman said.

“We realized we were doing enough work ,

where we were putting in a lot of our time,
but we’re not doing enough work where we
were at the level to win,“ he said.

This semester, the team has traveled to

. California, Florida and North Carolina for

events. The competitions, usually lasting
two to three days, are hard to plan around.
That’s especially true when the team has to
ﬂy to California for a weekend tournament,
Hausman said.

The team has practiced three times a
week for about three years. This year, track
workouts and lifting sessions supplement
practices. Kaczmarek described the team’s
training approach as just as close to a varsity
sport as possible. The time—consuming ef-
forts are a‘ result of the team’s early exit in
the national tournament last season.

Even though team member Trent Dillon is
only a freshman, he said he senses‘ a change
in the team’s approach from last year.

“There’s a palpable shift in where the
team is headed,” ‘Dillon said. “Last year at

_ this time they were kind of laying off of the

work and starting to take things easy.”
Hausman said that he was disappointed
to leave the tournament in the quarterﬁnals
when he wanted to take home the champi-
onship. A l -
“That’s what really kind of pushed me to
come back for this year,” he said.
Anything less than an appearance in the
national championship game this year will

._ be viewed as a failure by the players. '

' “This is the best Pitt team that we’ve ever
been. We didn’t perform when it came time

to [,last‘year],” Hausman said. “It’s really ',

important to us that that doesn’t happe
again.” ‘
The team will look to take fulladvantage
of the month-long break between regionals
and nationals. Unlike most schools, Pitt’s

semester ends of at the end of April, giving 

the team time off to prepare.
“[Nationals is] the only thing that’s on
our mind,” Conner said. “There’s really no

. other option for us-this year.”  .

pocket.”

Their goal is to make it to the Olym-
pics, which they can reach through Olympic
qualifying trials.

“We don’t take this as a' little fun type
of thing,” Alex said. “We have a goal to get
to the Olympics.” 4

Curling became an oﬂicial Olympic sport
in 1998. After the 2002 Winter Olympics
in Salt Lake City, the sport blossomed in
the United States because ofthe increased
exposure, and traditional clubs that fea-
tured private curling ice surfaces ﬁlled.
As a result, arena curling, in which clubs
rent ice time instead of owning their own
surfaces, grew. '

The Pittsburgh Curling Club rents most
of its ice time from the Robert Morris Uni-
versity Island Sports Center. Because the

club is an arena curling team, the Visniches .

are limited to one seven-hour rental per
week, which includes time for both practice
and competition.

“If we were a dedicated ice facility
[team], we could practice pretty much
whenever we wanted, whenever there
wasn’t any league play or bonspiel going
on,” Nicholas said. . '

Alex said that there is a stigma attached

. with being arena curlers.

“Most dedicated ice curlers, unless they

nothing to do with you,” he said. “Luckily,
my brother and I have broken through and
shown our caliber is up there with them
and sometimes even better.”

The brothers have tried in the past to
ﬁnd more Pitt students to ice a full team,
but they haven’t yet found anyone commit-

_ ted enough to join. Both Alex and Nicholas

are certiﬁed curling instructors.

“We have put things out there to get an
official full Pitt team, but because it is only
on Saturdays, a lot of people don’t want to
give up their Saturday,” Alex said. “Usually
people just want to come in from the uni-
versity, experience it for a night, and then
they don’t want anything else to do with it
because we take it too seriously.”
