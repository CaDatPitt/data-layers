State Right-to-Know
Law may change   

Tegan Hanlon'& Kelly Lyons

The Pitt News staﬁ"

Pennsylvania state representa-
tives introduced legislation to the‘
state House Monday that could
make Pitt and the other three-
state—related universities more
transparent.

Rep. Eugene DePasquale, D-
York, and 34 other Democratic
and Republican co—signers pro.-
posed a bill that would require
Pitt, Penn,’ State, Temple, Uni-
versity and Lincoln University
to adhere ‘to the Right-to—Kn_ow
Law, making their records more
transparent.

“Further transparency and

accountability is always a good .

thing,” _De-Pasquale said. His bill

~ was referred to the Committee"

on State Government Tuesday.
The bill still needs to be passed
by the state House and Senate
and signed by Gov. Tom Corbett
before it can take effect. . -

DePasquale’s House bill‘

amends the definition of “Com—
monwealth agency” in section
102 of the Right-to-Know law to
include state—related universi-
ties. The new version would re-
quire state—related universities to
disclose public records, includ-
ing ﬁnancial information. * ‘

Currently, the only informa-
tion that state-related institu-
tions, such as Pitt and Penn State,
must make public is their 990 tax
forms and the salaries of their
highest—paid employees.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele

declined to comment on Pitt’s _

reaction to the impending leg-
islation. . .

The interest in revamping the
Right—to-Know law stems from
the recent Penn State football

‘scandal where police and attor-

neys found it difficult to obtain
documents regarding former

Penn State football coach Jerry.

Pitt sophomore Alexandra Broso-
vich sees her family only two or
three times a year. i - ” ’
At the end of ﬁnals week,
she’ll embark on a long—awaited
visit back to her home in Atlanta,
Ga. But asuexcited as she is to get
home, Brosovich can attest that
her trips to the South are anything
but cheap. . , '
“It’s deﬁnitely hard,” said Bro-
sovich, a history and political sci-
ence major. “Especially because I’m

already kind of ﬁnancially unstable
in this economy. I’m already «having
to spend money on tuition, books
and housing, and having to spend
the extra money to see my family

‘ is really hard.”

Brosovich ﬂies home for win-
ter break, summer and occasion-

ally Thanksgiving. This year, _she'

said she spent about $300 on her
round—trip plane ticket to get home
after ﬁnals. '

Around the holiday season each
year, airlines and other transporta-
tion companies like Megabus and
Amtrak raise their ticket prices.
The increase in prices for these

.companies is mostly based on
the demand for available tickets,
which often lines up with the times
students go home for breaks.

“As the demand goes up, the
prices go up,” said Nicole Thomas,
a marketing major. “That’s just
what you get with the market. It
encourages people to plan ahead
of time.” ‘ ‘ ‘

Thomas, a junior who lives in
Harrisburg, takes the Megabus
home from Pitt four times each
year. She said the most she has
paid for a Megabus round—trip
ticket to Harrisburg is about $30,
which is cheaper than paying for

Proponents of the amendment attest
that because state-related universities
receive tax dollars, they should have to
adhere to the same provisions as state
schools. .

we must hold entities afﬁliated with the

tions and ensure that the activities of those
associated with these organizations are

legal, ethical and moral,” DePasquale said

Board memberRyan Gayman, who introduced
the proposal, said the new Green Fund Advisory
Board was set up’ to “make our campus a better
place for students through sustainability.” And

adding the group to the bylaws will ensure that -

this committee is something that will continue
ﬁ'om year to year.

The Green Fund Advisory Board’s respon-
sibilities will include allocating a “Green Ftmd”
in the amount of $2,500, which will come out of
the Environmental Committee’s portion of SGB’s
 budget.

The group doesn’t come up with the projecm
on its own, but collects student input and chooses
out of the incoming pool of ideas which ones to
pursue. - . A ~

This semester, the group has completed a
nmnber of projects, including the installation of
two hydration stations in the Hillman Library

Transportation companies increase prices with demand

Megabus 4 3

the gas and tolls if she were to drive
her car to and from home.

“I think [Megabus] is great for _

students and it’s very affordable,”
she said. “They have Wi—Fi on the
bus, and they drop me off just ﬁf-
teen minutes from my house.”
According to Dale Moser, the

president and Chief Operating Of-.

ﬁcer of Coach USA Megabus.com,
gas prices do notplay a role in de-
termining ticket pricing, which
keeps ticket prices fairly consis-
tent throughout the year.

“We use a yield-managed pric-

’ ing model that we designed [to de-

termine -ticket pricing] ,’-’. Moser

'‘ said. “It varies based on the time

of day youtravel, and demand for
certain trips. It’s very similar to
what airlines have been ‘doing for
20—plus years.” ' ‘ i

The most important factor in
determining ticket pricing is de-

mand, according to Mosser, which ‘

explains the reason ticket prices
increase around Thanksgivingand
the holiday season. V

“[Megabus ticket prices] might a

move ~... two or three dollars, based

on demand,”_ Moser said. “They’ll
decrease after the new year —Jan-
uary,4thA or 5th 4 as travel goes
down. They’ll start to go back up
in March or April, and usually stay
that way until the next New Year
season.” ' V
Megabus operates on a system
where ticket pricesare lowest as

soon as a route is added. As more.

and more tickets are purchased per
route, the prices increase. Because
of this, it’s best for cost—conscious
students .to purchase. tickets as
early as possible. ‘ '

Many students wholvalue con-

veniencerand enjoy riding home
with other Panthers take advan-

tage of the Pitt Buses Home for the‘ _

Holidays program, whichv. run for

Thanksgiving, winter and spring '

breaks. Chartered buses-pickis'tiu—

Union and takeithem to 13 loca-
tions in Pennsylvania, '-Maryland,
Ohio, New York and Washington,

The prices for round-trip bus
tickets range from $80 to $125.
. Another'option for students

who don’t mind spending time
on the road is the Amtrak_train.
Amtrak trains stop at 500 loca-
tions throughout the country, in-
cluding major cities like Boston,

During theoffseason, the same

ticket is priced at about $70.
“Fares are not automatically in-
creased during the holidays,” said
Southwest Airlines spokeswoman
Ashley Dillon. “The economic en-
- vironment does ‘play a role in the
cost of fares. If jet fuel prices are
at all-time highs, we may have to
increase ticket prices to adjust
for the increase in our costs. We
do this as a last measure, always
looking for ways to decrease our
costs.’.’

Dillon also said that Southwest
Airlines takes into account seat
availability, demand and the fre-

‘ _ quency of ﬂights when determin-

ing ticket prices.

Despite the ﬁnancially draining.

, cost of transportation in today’s
"economy, Pitt students will con-
, tinue to pay the extra bucks to get
home for the holidays.
« For William Lauhoff, a sopho-

shuttle back to his home in Phila-
delphia, the costs are unavoid-
able. —

  raises

slight students  

After all that’s happened this year,
We thought Pitt couldn’t possi-
bly disrespect its students any

.IIlOl'€. ' ,

_. But we were wrong.
The Pitt News reported Monday
that Pitt’s Board of Trustees Com-
pensation Committee approved

pay increasesfor six University 1

ofﬁcers.nTheir salaries will range
from $208,000 to $762,000.
In these dire economic times,

we fail to understand how these

raises beneﬁt the University as a
whole. After state -appropriation
cuts,,Pitt' hiked in-state tuition

by 8.5 percent and staff salaries I

by ‘2 percent. And less than one
year later, it agreed to pay certain
administrators more beyond that
hike. . . .
Andfor what? According to
The Pitt News article, “... the sal-
ary increases were recommended

..because of the ‘institutional per-

formance and contributions made
by those oﬂicers.”.’ .

When compiling a list of Pitt’s
best achievements in the past year,
we think of Cory Rodgers, who
was recently named a 2012 Rho-
,des‘Scholar. Rodgersenhanced

the reputation and honor of this .

institution from his own merit.
Pitt also received its largest do-
nation — $125 million — to date

from the late alumnus William S. _

Dietrich II.

The quality of a university visn’t
determined by its administrators
and faculty —and certainly not
by administrators and faculty

alone. Students are the driving

force behind this University and
everything it has accomplished.

in We think Rodgers’ and
Dietrich’s accomplishments alone
show the sheer power that stu-
dents and'alumni have over Pitt’s
success. When deciding who

should get ﬁnancial breaks, then,‘
shouldn’t Pitt acknowledge the
real difference-makers who actu-
ally need them? (Hint: They’re not
the six people you’ve beenhearing

‘ about for the past couple of days

 for theﬁrst time.)

Essentially, these Pitt officials
are patting themselves on the back
for students’ accomplishments._
We make this school the highly

' regarded institution that it is, and

if Pitt doesn’t realize this soon,
tuition hikes and faculty raises

' will ultimately erode all the prog-

ress the University has made in
the past several years because the
quality of students will decrease
as the greed of the administra-
tion rises.

_ At first, when we saw that
Chancellor .Mark Nordenberg
asked for a wage freeze, we were
elated.‘ With the rate of inﬂation,

:a wage freeze is essentially a pay
cut nowadays, but Nordenberg

has quite a bit of padding in his
$561,000 salary.

But why Nordenberg abstained
from the money—grubbing is a
moot point, after all. The fact is
that these six people, as well ac-
complishedand savvy they might
be, are being paid a grand total of
$3,042,000, which is ridiculous.
That’s about 200 students’ term
tuition. V ‘

Pitt should realize that it needs
to put students ﬁrst in order to re-
main competitive. Students bring
in money, provide large applica-
tion pools and keep this institu-
tion on its feet.

To give raises to ofﬁcials who
are already living more than com-
fortably is a slap in the face to ev-
ery hard-working, tuition—paying
student on this campus. There are
28,000 of us, by the way.

And we’re not happy.

We’re sure you’re all probably devas-

Brawl series might come to an end. If‘

you can’t direct your spleen at those

horde of junior college dropouts who
represent them on the gridiron, how
will you be able to go on living? Fear
not, dear readers: There is a slew of

networks for you to loathe. Let’s take
a look at. some of the more obvious
possibilities.

Minnesota Timberwolves (NBA ‘ "

team): Fronted by chalky—white baller
nonpareil Kevin Love, the Timber-
wolves are one ofseveral professional
sports teams thatyou should consider
hating. Not only are they consistently
mediocre — from legendary ball hog
Michael Beasley to overpaid backup

center Darko Milicic, nearly every v

linkonthisteam’s chain isasweakas
papier—maché —but they’re virtually‘
unknown among the general public. If
you start hating them now, you’ll have
aconsiderable head start onallthose
bandwagon-jumpers who insist on
only hating successful teams. Other
possibilities: Columbus Blue jackets
(NHL?), Nashville Predators (NHL,
we thinkllackonsvillejagliars (NFL
— for now), B.C. Lions (2011 Grey
Cup Champs).

Rick Perry (Politician): It’s easy to
hate onasleazebaglike Newt Gingrich
orjerry Sandusky but much harderto
despise an aw-shucks imbecile like
Perry. Perry,‘ who has embarked on
one of the strangest “redemption
quests” of all time — appearing on
late-night chat shows to mock his
own idiocy — is threatening to make
America fall in love with him. You can
stop this program of character reha-
bilitation by refusing to allow him to
live down the fact that he couldn’t
remember a few basic facts. As was
the case with your unfortunate WVU
brethren, a rivalry is always better
when you’re able to feel mentally su-
perior to the person or group you’re
up against (and if you’re earning a

It’s no secret that our generation has
a bad reputation. We’re constantly
hailed as the “youth of America”
while simultaneously thought of as

narcissistic.

While Americans our age are .

than past generations before start-

‘ing their careers, that doesn’t mean

our age group is perceived as smarter
than those from the past. The'follow-
ing is a list of reasons why Genera-
tionY could be stigmatized forhaving
an inﬂated sense of self importance
and thought about with an, “Oh crap,

- they’re going to lead the country some

day” attitude:

MTV shows. MTV and all of its re-
ality television are huge staples of our
generation’s pop culture. With shows
like fjersey Shore,” “Friendzone” and
“The Real World,” the stupidity that
these programs perpetuate is only

surpassed by the stupidity of the

Yes, ‘these are all Facebook statuses
.1 have seen on my news feed. Good
luck getting jobs. 1 A
Political Naiveté. The prime ex-
ample here is the Occupy movement,
which has members from all different

’ generations, from college students

to older adults frustrated with our
country’s politics. Its lackof a goal and
plan is a prime example of the public’s
political naiveté. Occupy has no dis-
cernable goals, no leader and no plan
to jumpstart its “world revolution.”
Though its message is admirable and
might have merit, standing in front
of economic strongholdsaround the
world is hardly an effective technique
for achieving any real change. Un-
less Occupy comes up with a better
course of action, it’s unlikely‘ that it’ll
be anything more than an entertain-
ing ﬁiture music video from some do-

, gooder band like U2 or Coldplay;

Unfortunately, Occupy is a ma-

' jor political demonstration for both

our generation and society. More
people our age can probably tell you
the length of Kim Kardashian’s mar-
riage than how longformer-Egyptian

Rdimthlrollcles,

country before he was ousted, where
“Jersey Shore” is ﬁlmed than where

, Syria is,- and who the current cast of

“‘The- Real World” isthan the candi-
dates vying for the 2012 Republican
presidential nomination. Occupy did
a great job of getting the public mo-
bilized and interested in changing

~ politics, but the movement’s lack of ’

direction and intelligence illustrates
society’s lack of political awareness.
Though this mightbe read as abour-

geois_ critique, I assure you I am not

the 1 percent.

Sense of Entitlement. «Another ’

characteristic unfortunately attrib-
uted to our generation-is a sense of
entitlement. This more than likely
results from our parents’ coddling
of us when we experienced failure
in childhood,‘ awarding trophies to

kids based solely, on participation .

and explaining to each of us that
we were special and different from

everyone else. Contrary to what you ’
' might believe, you__do not deserve to

get an A in a class thatyou skip twice.

Do you know what my favorite
part of the holiday season is?
It’s those chocolate Advent

motivator. Your day stinks. Oh,
there’s chocolate to be had? Life
is worth living again!

That’s why I think everybody
needs a chocolate Advent calen-
dar for the BBVA Compass Bowl.
It’s the same bowl Pitt went to
last year, and, yes, it’s still in Bir-
mingham, Ala. There isn’t much
to get excited about.

I’m dangerously low on choco-
late, as I seem to have eaten all of
mine, so how about facts about
Pitt’s opponent Southern Meth-
odist instead? Facts are always
nice. With the BBVA Compass

The Mustangs play in Confer-
ence USA, which Tulsa, Houston
and Southern Mississippi also
call home (1). They ﬁnished 5-3
in the conference and 7-5 overall

- (2), and their signature win this

year came in overtime at No. 20
Texas Christian; 40-33 (3).

They also defeated defending

Conference USA champion, Cen-
tral Florida at home, 38-17 (4).

After that game, sophomore
walk—on Stephen Nelson wrote a
column for SMU’s Daily Campus
in which he called the student
body “stubborn and pathetic”
and that road games resemble
“what I dreamed about rather
than the pee—wee football experi-
ence we have here where it seems
only the players’ parents are in
the stands” (5). '

The announced attendance at
Gerald J. Ford Stadium for the
win over Central Florida was
22,932 (6). .

Gerald.J. Ford, a billionaire
banker and SMU alumnus, is
not to be confused with Gerald
R. Ford, the 38th President of
the United States and not an SMU
alumnus (7).

Other former SMU attendees

include Laura Bush, Kourtney’
Kardashian and‘ Eric Dickerson
(8). Kardashian transferred after
two years (9).

Senior J.J. McDermott starts
at quarterback for the Mustangs
(10). He completed 59.5 percent
of his throws this year, compared
to Tino Sunseri’s 63.9 percent
(11). Like Sunseri, McDermott
had as many touchdown passes
as he had interceptions - 13-
of each (12). Sunseri had 10 of
each.

Running back Zach Line had
17 touchdowns in SMU’s first 10
games (13), but he is out for the
season with a torn tendon in his‘.
toe that he suffered ina loss to ‘A
Navy on Nov. 12 (14).

His replacement Rishad Wim-
bley rushed for 115 yards and two
touchdowns in SMU’s regular-
season finale against Rice (15).
The freshman, who weighed 295?‘
pounds before the season (16), is
a converted nose tackle (17).

more responsibilities, Dixon said, suchas involving
' “ teammates. I
Pitt ﬁnished 13933 from beyond the arc.

, With the game in Pitt’s favor early, Dixon
reached deep into his bench. Twelve players, in-
cludingredshirtﬁeshmanIsaiahEpps and redshirt
senior walk~on Nick Rivers, logged minutes for

122.2 Panthers.

, Rivers, whousuallyplays nearthe end of games
when the Panthers have a large lead, subbed in
withaminute remainingintheﬁrsthalfagainst
the Keydets — a move Dixon said he would have
made even if the game was close.

[Robinson finishes with doubleedouble

“With 'I‘ravon being out, we have to ﬁnd an—-

other guard that can play some minutes,” Dixon
said. “I feel comfortable withjohn [Johnson] and
Cameron [Wright] playingthattwo—spotfor us, so
we gotto getsomebodytoplay some minutes forus
at the point. Nick [Rivers] and Isaiah [Epps] have
been battling each other. Itwas good to get them
in there and get them some action.”

Dante Taylor and Nasir Robinsonalsoﬁnished
with double ﬁgures for the Panthers; Taylor had
10 points and seven rebounds, whﬂe Robinson,
whopicked up his second straight double-double
before halftime, ﬁnished with 19 points and 14

rebounds.

“I knew [Robinson] was good, butl didn’t know
hewas that effective,”VMI head coachDuggarBau—
con said. “I think Robinson is a stud. We knew he
was goingtobe abeast. He does alot ofthings.”

Pitt dominated the paint throughoutthe game,

_ outrebounding VMI 60-31 -28 more than they

had againstTennessee.

“Obviouslythe reboundingstands out,” Dixon
said. “I think our depth is helping us out in that
direction. I think we_’re going to be a very good
rebounding team. We’re going to get there, but I

_ don’tthinkwe’re there yet.” ﬂ -

Pitt, SMU last

met in 1983

Cotton Bowl

ShdIJ4(7

school is currently on Peruna IX, which

took over for Peruna VIII in October of '

this year (20). The mascot line is known

for its temper — a Perunaonce allegedly V

killed Fhrdham’s ram mascot with a kick
to thehead (21). ‘

SMU is often confused for other schools .-

because ofits abbreviation. SMU is South-
ern Methodist, USM is Southern Missis-

_ sippi and SMC is St. Mary’s College of Cali-
fornia, which boasts a’ strong mid—major

basketball program (22).

Total number of Texans on the Dallas— *

based team: 76 (23). Total number of
Pennsylvanians on the team: '0 (24). Pitt,
meanwhile, has ﬁve Texans on its roster,
and head coach Todd Graham, not coin-
cidentally, also hails from the Lone Star
State. ~ ,
SMU remains the only college football

_program to receive the “death penalty”
_(25). The NCAA terminated its 1987 sea-

son for egregious rule violations and. cor-.
ruption that saw the school paylathletes
through a slush fund starting as early as

‘the mid-1970s (26). .

The Mustangs went 25 years between
bowls (27). After beating Notre Dame in the
19.84 Aloha Bowl, 27-20, they ‘didn’t make
another postseason appearance until the
2009 Hawaii Bowl, in which_ they trounced
Nevada*45-10 (28). .

_ Four current NFL players played col-
lege ball at SMU, including Steelers wide
receiver Emmanuel Sanders (29).

The Mustangs claim three national
titles; 1935, 1981 and "1982 (30). SMU
concluded its 1982 claimed championship

. season by defeating Pitt in the Cotton Bowl,

7-3 —— the most recent game between the
two schools (31)..
