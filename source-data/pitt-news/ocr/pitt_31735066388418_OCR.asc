Federal auditors said last week that Pitt
wrongly charged $259,089 in administrative
expenses, such as travel costs for Pitt
President Wesley Posvar’s wife and
symphony and opera tickets, as overhead
expenses for federal research grants.

But university spokespeople and
administrators are alleging the audit
represents a misunderstanding between
the Department of Health and Human
Services, which performed the audit, and
the university about the billing of
administrative costs. Spokespeople from
Health and Human Services were
unavailable for comment.

were acceptable and were inaccordance
with the rules set down by the HHS and the
federal government itself," said Posvar at a
university Senate Council meeting Monday.
“And so we have this disparity with the
reporting and perceptions  Our argument
was that henceforth they should not take a
cross section and should focus only upon
costs that are ‘specifically identified as
overhead recovery,” said Posvar. _

“[The rules] were, ambiguous by their
very nature. Now the rules have changed
and they went and applied the old rules to
the new system.” said Tim Ziaukas, a
university spokesperson. “It’s dubious 
questionable." ‘

that Pitt should have known better. “When
you’re in doubt, don’t you ask?” said Holtz,

The audit was conducted because “there

is a profound  congressional antagonism
toward the public research universities,”
Posvar said.

spokesperson, said the audit ,was
conducted partly to portray Rep. John

the HHS audit, as being tough onsaving

Instructors at the University of Pittsburgh

at T itusville soon may not have to spend a
lot of time deciding what to include in their

courses. If the UPT administration overrules
faculty objections, all classes will be
standardized, and each student will have
to meet pre-set academic standards.

Marianne‘ Barber, president of the UPT
senate faculty, said she disagreed with the
administration’s proposal.

Barber spoke at the Senate Council
meeting on the Pittsburgh campus Monday
and said her opinions “include  probably
a majority of the UPT faculty senate.”

A letter from a UPT administrator said —

that the UPT faculty senate and its
committees have not asked to discuss
standardization, which he claims has been

“discussed in various forums" for two years.

Barber said she accidentally learned of
the plan during a casual conversation with
a colleague in late March.

“[The proposal is a] public relations
scheme, I suppose, to increase enrollment,”
Barber said.

According to Barber, the UPT president,
along with the academic dean and an

instructor from the.En'glish department, _

attended an ou»t=comes~assessment
conference in Washington, D.C., in March.

She said with the exception of the
composition instructor, who was not
chosen by his colleagues to attend, “no
UPT faculty knew anything of this
conference.” ‘ 1

Under the proposed "plan, course
standardization and outcome assessment
would begin with UPT’su English
composition department. . ' I

There are five instructors in the -English
department at Titusville. One professor is
tenured, and one is in the tenure stream.

Four of them are opposed to the
proposal. .

The instructor ‘who attended the
Washington conference is in the tenure

stream and supports the administrative 

initiative: _
Shortly after the Washington conference,
the dean and president called a ‘meeting of
the English department to begin to
standardize composition courses. ’
Despite the overwhelming opposition,
Barber said all composition instructors
“participated out of fear for their jobs.”
She said the unpopular proposal created
a feeling of mistrust among UPT faculty
members. ‘

During one meeting, according to Barber, 

teachers were reduced to arguing over

Posvar said the expenses, which included
Pittsburgh Athletic Association’ dues and
mobile phones for administrators, that'were
billed to overhead were legitimate.

“All of the costs that were incurred in "
central administration and management.

were legitimate costs pertaining to
development, alumni,‘ student affairs ,.. It
was arbitrary what the general auditors
chose to identify in those costs as being
part of the overhead. There was nothing
wrong with the funding  by the university.

What they object to is that they were '

House cominittee puts Cowell bill on hold

By Renee Crespy
News Editor

The vote on the Cowell bill,
which would grant public access
to Pitt's financial records, was put
on -hold last Wednesday by a close
decision of the House Education
Committee.

The bill, introduced by State

_,Rep. Ron Cowell (D.—Wilkins),

would amend the state’s Right To
Know Act to include the four state
schools: Pitt, Penn State, Lincoln
and Temple universities.

‘ “I disagreed with the idea of
tabling it, but the majority agreed
to give the schools more time,"
said Cowell- -

The four state—related schools

are currently receiving millions in

 

state funds each year, but they are
not required to publicly reveal
their records since they are not
agencies of the commonwealth.

The 14 state-owned universities

are required to make public most
of their financial records,
including the salaries of all

employees, endowment funds

and spending documents.

State-related universities
maintain that they don’t have to
release information on budgets,
salaries, endowments, building
plans and research because they
are private institutions.

“When I met with administrators
from the the schools, they were
opposed to the bill, but they had
no persuasive arguments to raise
opposition,” said Cowell.

The Pr-Io lnaagg

E VER YTHING FOR

 

 

THE -SPORTS FAN

 
   

According to Cowell, the four
state—related schools together
receive a half-a—bi1lion dollars in
state appropriations and therefore
are public institutions.

“I think that because of that,
they should apply to the Right Tc
Know Act,” said Cowell.

Pitt has lobbied against the bill,
reasoning that it is a state—related
university, not a state agency.

Ann Dykstra, assistant director
of commonwealth relations at Pitt,
said, “The University of
Pittsburgh’s position is in
opposition to the bill, and our
purpose is to move the bill out 01
committee.” i

Cowell said the bill would make
university ofﬁcials more cautious
in their dealings with university

funds.

“I don’t know if it would control
[mismanagement of funds}, but
when there is the light of public
scrutiny involved, university off-
icials are more prudent in the
choices that they make,” he said.

“I think eventually through this
bill, state—related universities will
be required to operate under the
Right To Know law, and
revelations like those at Pitt
[concerning the alleged improper
spending of federal research
grants] help its chances,” said
Cowell.

If allegations against Pitt are '

true, he said, that’s further
evidence that the bill should be
passed and applied to all four
state-‘related schools.

When an alumni banquet,
scheduled to include scholarship
awards and football coaches from
one of the country’s leading
universities, becomes entangled
in accusations of sexism and unfair

' blackballing, where else could

you be but in Erie, Pa.?

The story erupted on May 2
when the University of Pittsburgh
abruptly withdrew its
participation in an Erie Pitt-alurnni
dinner held at the Erie
Maennerchor Club. This occurred
just ﬁve hours before head football
coach Paul Hackett and other Pitt
representatives were scheduled
to appear. . _

The club, which has no female
members, was accused of sexism

membership was rejected twice.
In protest, one of her sponsors,
Erie County Judge Roger M.
Fischer, resigned from the club.

A May 8 letter from Fischer to
Beth Johnson, acting director of
Alumni Relations at Pitt, was
obtained by The Pitt News. In the
letter, Fischer expressed his
appreciation of Pitt’s decision to
pull its people from the Erie
banquet and enclosed a donation
to the university.

“l’m enclosing a check which I
would appreciate your crediting
to the Law School which helped
to instill the values that led to my
resignation from the club and my
original letter to you,” Fischer’s
letter said. Neither Johnson nor
Fischer would reveal the amount
of the contribution.

Fischer cited American Bar
Association codes that prohibit
him from associating with
organizations that discriminate.
“Neither will .I attend functions
at the club, and I should think that
the University of Pittsburgh would
not wish to be associated with or
hold meetings at such facilities,”
the letter said. .
Johnson responded to Fischer’s
recommendation in an April 26
letter. She said it was too late to
change the site of the event, but
the judge’s advice would be taken
into account for future functions.
In a second letter to Johnson,
dated May 2, Fischer urged
stronger action. “If Pitt  would
refuse to hold meetings at facilities
that discriminate, changes would
occur more rapidly,” he said. _

Nicaraguan president
addresses Duquesne

By David Welch V
For The Pitt News

Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the first freely elected president
of Nicaragua’s ﬂedgling democracy, called for an exchange
between Nicaraguan and American universities when she spoke
at Duquesne University’s commencement on Saturday.

President Chamorro was awarded an honorary doctorate of _
humane letters by Duquesne President John E. Murray.

Murray said, “We are bestowing the degree because she stands
for what this university stands for: liberty, free press, courage,
fortitude and justice.”

At a press conference before the ceremony, Chamorro asked
for aid from educational institutions in the United States.

Chamorro said, “I hope Duquesne will open its doors for the
youth of Nicaragua. I know [Duquesne President Murray and
Chairman Richard L. White] will help me and be a spokesperson
for Nicaraguan students with all other universities in the United
States.”

decision and cancelled the event.

“Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet. I think Pitt did the
right thing. There was no way Pitt "could associate with an
organization that discriminates,” Johnson said.

Alumni Relations plans to send updated guidelines to Pitt’s

other 34 alumni organizations stating they are not to hold their '

functions at discriminatory facilities, according to Johnson.

Nicholas Gervase, who resigned as president of the Erie Pitt-
‘Alumni Club, said he felt abandoned by Pitt.

“They are loyal alumni, and we will do everything we can to
heal these wounds,” Johnson said. “We’ve even asked Nick
[Gervase] to stay on as president of the group.”

Gervase said he has heard nothing official from Pitt and isn’t ‘

sure what-he will do.

The M aennerchor Club’s charter states that only five blackballs
are required to vote down a nominee for full membership, even
though the club now has close to 3,000 members.

Domitrovich was rejected twice for membership.

“We stopped counting black balls at 249. This became more
than an issue over discrimination. Our members .were tired of
being pressured by Fischer and Domitrovich,” Maennerchor-
President Jeffrey Johnson said. There weren't enough black
balls for the members who wanted to vote "no," he said.

Fischer said it was made clear to him after the March vote that
his candidate was rejected solely because she is a woman.

“These guys made a large mistake, being so vocal about about

their sexist opinions,” Fischer said.

Murray said that he and
Chamorro discussed possible
exchanges of faculty and students.

“She is also interested in
Nicaraguan students coming to
other universities in Pittsburgh
such as Pitt and Carnegie Mellon, ”
said Murray. Chamorro’s niece is
a freshman at Duquesne.

Nicaraguan Minister of
Education, Humberto Belli,
invited,U.S. students to study in
Nicaragua. , _

“American students can come
to a joint junior college we are
developing, providing we get
support from American
universities,” Belli said.

Since Chamorrotook office a

_ year ago, she has received some

outside support for education.

“Aid has been given by the
United Nations to change school
texts in all Nicaraguan schools
from kindergarten to high school,”
she said.

Chamorro said more changes
need to be made.

“In my country, one—third of
the students do not even have
desks or chairs to sit in,” she said.

Chamorro said the United States"
and President Bush have done a
lot for her country.

“I cannot tell the president of
any country to give me so much,”
she said. “But when I speak, I let

' them know the worries that I have.

Any money is welcome in my
country.” - ,
In an April 16 address to the
U.S. Congress, President
Chamorro said that Nicaragua,
“urgently needs foreign
investment and credit." "
Last week she invited American
businesspeople “to come and visit
Nicaragua and see what kind of
investment opportunities there
are.” A
Chamorro praised Pittsburgh
for rebuilding itself. "I was in
Pittsburgh 40 years ago. It was a
town of pollution and smoke.
Now it is a paradise. You should
be proud. Give me the secret so I
can make my country as

beautiful.”

_ Nicaragua has been trying to_ .
attract foreign assistance to rebuild - '
itself from its 10-year civil war‘?
between the Sandinistas and the _-J.
Contras, which ended on Feb. 25, I

1990, with a free election between
Chamorro and Sandinista
candidate Daniel Ortega. I

With Chamorro the victor,

democracy was successfully" ,
installed for the first time in

Nicaragua’s history.
But many problems still remain.

Nicaragua has an $8 billion debt-

and, according to former Costa
Rican president Oscar Arias, “it
ranks among the poorest nations
in the hemisphere.”

In addition, reports in both
Newsweek and Time indicate that
the Sandinistas are trying to regain
power by subverting Chamorro’s
government.

Chamorro disagreed.

According to ‘Chamorro,
“Sandinistas are workingin the
government and cooperating
well.”

service,” said Ziaukas.

Ziaukas would not specify how Cacali was responsible for the
university’s dissatisfaction with the food—service department.

According to Cacali, the university "[wasl very vague when
they suspended me, and even the charges that they investigated
were vague," she said.

Ziaukas said that Hughes had agreed to resign. “In light of the
recent investigations, both Mr. Hughes and [Pitt] agreed it was in
the best interest of all parties concerned that he resign," he said.

Cacali said the university had wrongfully suspended her
several weeks ago. “[After the suspension] the university cleared
me at that time, and I decided to voluntarily resign  We entered
into negotiations. I refused to sign what they wanted me to sign
 it became an involuntary separation,” she said.

Cacali said she was unsure of what further action she would
take against the university, but she asserted, “I'm not going to let
it rest."

Pitt’s food service had been embroiled in scandal since an
audit in December revealed that Pitt's food-service contractor
catered a private wedding reception for a friend of Robert
Heddleston, former executive director of the Golden Panthers.

For the past 30 years Brutus’
writing has been banned in South
Africa. However, in 1990, two of
his books —-—A Simple Lust and
Stubborn Hope — were made
available to the public, according
to Brutus. ‘'

“The banning order in October
1961 was really aimed -at me

said Brutus. “The government

Brutus said he was persecuted
by the government because he
worked to fight apartheid.

“I was attacking the racism in
education, racism in housing,
racism in jobs, racism in culture,
the theater —which was for whites
only — and racism in sport. When
I was arrested, it was at a sports
meeting for the Olympic
Committee,” he said.

Under new President Willem

de Klerk, South Africa seems to
have made steps toward the
abolishment of apartheid, but
Brutus does not find these steps
reassuring.

“I have serious doubts about
their sincerity; what they say is
not always matched by what they
do. I imagine in time that it will
work out," he said. “ Promises are
being made, but without the
intention of keeping them.”

Unjustified expenditures...

The most talked-about number of the week in Pittsburgh
is 259,085. The Department of Health and Human
Services is alleging that Pitt rnischarged the government
$259,085 in overhead costs for research on items such as
Christmas cards, chocolates, USAir club memberships,
cellular phones and symphony and opera tickets _——— not
to mention engraved stationary for Mildred Posvar.

Of Pitt’s annual $626 million annual budget, $113
million is from federal grants. The federal government
agreed to pay for 17 percent of all Pitt’s administrative
costs for the fiscal year 1989-1990 because it reasoned
that about 17 percent of administrative costs were related
to research. ~

Pitt spokesperson Mary Ann Aug said the government
never specified the terms of how overhead costs should
be determined.

However, Pitt should have known that paying-for these
executive perks is not justifiable. .

Pitt President Wesley Posvar reasoned that Pitt is not at’
fault for charging the expenditures to the government
because the particulars of the policy between the
government and Pitt were too vague. \

However, Department of Health and Human Services
spokesperson Judy Holtz said, “When you’re in doubt,
don’t you ask? The [university] should know what is
allowable and what is not. If there were any questions,
they should have called the division of cost allocations.”

Did Pitt administrators really think it was necessary for
taxpayers to pay for their frequent-ﬂyer memberships?

Their car phones? Their alcohol for “various functions”?

i T heir first—class.:airplane ﬂights .to San Francisco?

A driver of Posvar’s leased vehicle was even paid his
salary through the funds ——-"a salary which amounted to
$31,253. , - ‘

In addition, chocolates for a sick employee should be
paid for by his/her co-workers, not by taxpayers. ’

Posvar and Pitt representatives have alleged that the»

audit is part of a government vendetta against major

research universities. A A
Regardless of the dispute between HHS and Pitt over

the legitimacy of charging these expenses to the

government, it is still questionable whether or not these '

items should have been purchased in the first place.
Last year tuition increased 6 percent for in-state students
and 10 percent for out-of-state students. With that in
mind, it’s -hard to believe that Posvar and his colleagues
have the audacity to spend $1,175 on a football trip to
Ireland for Assistant President Katarina Veeder Schulhof
and her husband, and then continue to ask for government

,3, monies for educational purposes.

One of the greatest snow jobs
of the past 10 years is occurring
right now, and most of you
probably do not even know it. I
am referring to the ongoing media
campaign in support‘ of the so-
called “Brady bill.” The media is
blinding the American people to
the facts about this ludicrous piece
of pending legislation.

‘ Did,-you know that NBC, CBS,’
-and ABC refused to let the

National Rifle «Association run
paid ads even though the NRA
promised to submit watered-

down spots? The anti—gun people,

on the other hand, get free
publicity from all the networks
and most newspapers. The media
would also have you believe that
those of us who support 2nd
Amendment rights don’t care
about rising crime rates and the
carnage on the streets of some
cities. That. is ridiculous! What
these people don’t tell you is that
gun control will solve absolutely

-nothing.‘

Here are some facts that are
backed up by decades of police
and FBI crime statistics, not just
NRA claims:

Strict gun control has NO effect

there is actually an inverse effect.

Yesterday, when I walked
_down that stretch of Forbes

 Avenue betvveen the union and

T CBY, at least ﬁve people asked

. me for money. It was hot and

‘humid, and I was going to get
myself something to quench my
thirst. I tried to block out these
men from my mind, these grown
men asking me for change. “Spare
some_ change for the homeless,”
they yelled. I couldn’t, of course.
Instead I fed .my face and
pretended these people didn’t
exist.

And it wasn’t just yesterday.

I It’s every day. The same men, the

same people are standing on
Forbes Avenue begging for
change, and I'm never sure if I
should give it to them or not.
What made my decision no less
difficult was my recent viewing

of Home Less Home, a-

documentary produced and
directed by Bill Brand, that probes
some of the lives of the thousands
_ of Americans —— young and old,
weak and strong, proud and
ashamed, all falling under the

" category of homeless.

What I was expecting from this

. film was something like “48 Hours

on Poor Street,” or some other

ooooooooooooooooooooooooloooooooooooooooooooOoneOiotiﬂﬁi0005000000000

pseudo-television attempt to
address a social issue. Brand’s
vision of the homeless as people
who live and breathe in the same
world that we do, and his desire
to show us the everyday facets of
their lives, has brought this

’ documentary to a higher level

than mere patronizing fare. He
takes us past our point of view,
the point of view of the average
passerby, and dives straight into
the lives of people who have
little more than the clothes on
their backs. V

The biggest leap of faith that
Brand asks his viewers to make is
the one that demands that we
look past the stereotypes of the
homeless as mentally ill, drug
addicted or just plain lazy. He
articulates his message through
the people themselves, allowing
their stories to convey their
conﬂicts.

One of his subjects refers to the
system as “designed for failure.
It's a revolving door that keeps
going around and around.” Here
Brand allows his political views
to shape the way we perceive our
citizens.Brand ﬂashes facts in our
faces about the statistics through

'which we usually view the

homeless. He also intercuts

4. Galaxie S00 — “Fourth of Ju1y”: Also

more to it than multicolored filters..The
filmmakers frequently use documentary

repeating certain dark images (a woman

almost unbearably frightening. It's a scary
counterpoint to the group's warm, melodic
sound and proves this is a band that

if they do occasionally write about

3. Ride — “Taste”: I like seeing stuff get
trashed, and most of this video features a

young girl doing just that in slow-motion,

so the clip gets a thumbs up even though
this is one of the brilliant Ride’s lesser
tunes.

2. Sonic Youth— “Dirty Boots”: There’s
nothing like seeing what a band with,
avowed 'anti—establishment (an-d

_will do once they're given some MTV

exposure. The Replacements,‘after getting
signed to the big time, made a video for

You’ve heard the old adage —-
sequels to good movies should
never be made. Well, this really
applies to the new movie FX 2 —
The Deadly Art of Illusion.

This part—2 movie reunites

; special-effects wizard Rollie Tyler
(Bryan Brown) and cop-turned-

private-eye Leo McCarthy (Brian

Dennehy) from the original FX. In_

this one the two heroes face an
even bigger challenge than in the
first movie, when again, Tyler is
enlisted by the New York police

force to help catch a would-be.

killer and is again set up.
Tyler returns from his ﬁnancially
rewarding experiences in the

/

original film with a wife and
stepson. He is convinced" by his
wife's ex-husband, Mike, to help
set a trap for a murderer by using
his special-effects abilities to reel
in the suspect.

In the process, however, Mike
gets killed by a hired thug, and
the police sergeant shoots the
would-be killer and blames Mike's
murder on him.

Tyler, of course, sees the whole

“thing on one- of his techno-

miniature cameras, and he then
is wanted by the dirty cops. At
this point, it is time to call in the
helpful services of his old
compadre McCarthy, who up until
this time has not made an
appearance. He enters the film in
true heroic and in-the—nick—of—

AP/X 2 little more than rehash o

time style, and then the adventure
begins ‘ with the two friends
together again. '

This movie has really more or
less the same plot as the first one.
The main difference is that the
first one was a nice story about a
set up involving crooked CIA
agents and highlighted by the
special effects wizardry of Tyler’s
movie experience.

The acting was good, the plot
line was clever, the gimmick was
fresh and creative, and the special
effects were an eye—catching
bonus. The second film relies far
too much on the same basic
premise with more dangerous
villains and more and new effects.
Thus, that’s all that this film is left
with —.— a few. neat effects. -n _ .

The acting in FX2 was ‘not as
good as in the ﬁrst, but no one
went to see either of these movies
for the exceptional performances.
The intricacies of the second set
up are far too complicated. They
are so complex that the plot
becomes too hard to believe,
even for a movie.

Every possible twist and bad
thing that can happen to our two
heroes occurs in this film. It seems
that the intention of its writers

was just to make it bigger and a

better. They went about doing it
by just making it so utterly
unrealistic that it would have to
top the original.

The movie ends very similarly
to the first one, and everybody

. lives happily ever after. Too many

f original

times throughout the course of
this movie, I found myself asking,
“Where did that come from?” or

\ “How did that happen?” Far too

much of what happens is just
dropped and left with only one
line conveniently placed to clarify
it—— or with no explanation at all.

If you just want to see a weak
sequel, or if you feel particularly
attached to Tyler and McCarthy
and want to be apart of their
continuing escapades, then by all
means go ‘see FX 2 —— The
Deadly Art of Illusion. However,
the movie really is not very good,
and the memories of the better
first one are more rewarding.
There are not enough special
effects in the movie business to
help FX 2. ‘ - '

will be produced in The Pit, the
building formerly occupied by

‘ City Theatre.

To create’ a festive ambiance‘
for the productions, the building
will be transformed into a castle-
like structure through the use of
trompe l’oeil painting and jewel-
toned banners. “We want to call
to mind the feel of the Elizabethan
theatre,” O’Connel1 said.

The second mainstage
production of the season is also a
world premiere. A Horse of a
Diﬂerent Colorby Ralph G. Allen,
the author of the Broadway hit,
Sugarbahies, is a farce that
explores the sometimes hilarious
events that often result from a
case of mistaken identity. The
choice of the play acts as a foil to
the season opener, Othello, which
explores the darker consequences
of mistaken identity.

Pens take dream season into Stanley Cup finals 6

Sometimes dreams come true,
and when they do, they have an
awesome ability to transform
masses of people into frenzied,
worshipping diehards.

Such is the case in the

’ metropolitan areas of Pittsburgh

and Minnesota, where fans have
thrown themselves at destiny’s
feet in hopes of drinking from the
glorious Stanley Cup. Somehow,
these two cities’ professional
hockey representativesare all that
remains of a grueling 100-plus
game schedule of jockeying and
eliminating positions. But for one
team and city, the dream will
shatter. ‘

“It was the best of times, it was
the worst of times," begins Charles

T Dickens’ classic A Tale Of Two

Cities. For both of these
franchises, it is the best of times.
Pittsburgh has never advanced
‘out’ of the Patrick Division

_ playoffs, while the North Stars‘

have shone only once this late in
 the season — in 1981 when they

dynasty, the New York Islanders.

American teams competed for
the Stanley Cup was in 1981. Two
players from the Penguins
competed in that series against
each other: center Bryan Trottier
(New York Isles) and defenseman
Gordie Roberts (Minnesota). The

Pens and North Stars also-

swapped four defensemen much
earlier in the year (Larry Murphy
and Peter T a glianetti to Pittsburgh
for two Minnesota natives, Jim
Johnson and Chris Dahlquist) in
a trade that has been integral in
both teams.’ consistent
improvement in play and
consequential berth into the
Stanley. Cup finals.

Both cities have also been
entrenched in the lowest depths
of the National Hockey League
standings since their inceptions
to the league in 1967. But that’s
where it ends— irony, friendship,
American or Canadian — it’s all
over. Lord Stanley’s grace awaits

the victor.

Minnesota’s berth is amazing,
immaculate and'almost a crazed
hallucination. They KO’ed the
winning of the Presidents Cup
(awarded to the team, with the
most points during the regular
season), and Vegas favored cup
challengers in the Chicago Black
Hawks. Then Minnesota gave St.
Louis the summertime blues by
winning six of their games, only
to swarm past the defending,
(and five out of the last seven
years) cup champion Edmonton
Oilers. This from a team that
finished below .500 during the
regular season and couldn’t draw
more fans than the Pittsburgh
Maulers (of U.S. Football League
fame), and it was on the verge of
having half of its young talent
shipped to its expansion sister,
the San Jose Sharks —— the most

‘remarkable case of mind over
~ matter that the NHL has witnessed , t-

in quite awhile. .. - ,
Minnesota has played solar
systems above its talent level in
order to get this far, but the most
important facet of the North Stars’
game is that they just don’t lose at

home anymore. They’ve won
seven straight at the now filled to
the rafters Met Centre since losing
their first home playoff game to
Chicago. By the way, the Pens
own the playoffs best road record,
andboth teams have two of the
top five N.H.L. records since the
all-star break. ,

The North Stars have some
playoff experience and players
like Brian Propp and Bobby Smith
have refined their scoring touches
and wreaked havoc on
opponents’ defensive schemes.
Brian Bellows, Dave Gagnerand
Mike Modano are all stellar
offensive threats and have fueled
Minnesota’s power—play unit,
which is clicking at the highest
rate of all playoff teams. Mark
Tinordi has blossomed into an
outstanding defenseman. J

Jon Casey is finally getting the
recognition he has deserved for
so many dreadful years of playing
behind a weak defense. His game
is as sharp as ever and could spell
trouble for the Penguins. The
same could be said of (Boston's
Andy Moog, who carried the
Bruins past Montreal but was

\

smoked like a cigar by the Pens’
potent attack. Running into
another hot goalie is something
every team must deal with this
late in the year, and Pittsburgh is
no exception.

T he‘ Pens have their own

netminder who’s on ﬁre. Tom‘

Barrasso has been sickle sharp,
particularly at home where he
has become the league ’s top home
stopper the second half of the

season. Paul Coffey hopes to .

return to the lineup for game
one, -and the Pens are going to
need him because Scott Young is
not the answer ‘on the power

play. The man advantage could

be the factor in this series.
Minnesota’s is tremendous, while
Pittsburgh's has been lukewarm.
The Pens have had trouble killing

‘penalties in the first three games

of each of their playoff series and
can’t allow that to happen here.
Minnesota has buried teams early
by striking on the power play
and the Pens needto counter that
by picking up where they left off

‘Senior Sta_[fPbotograpber

Lenny Dykstra’s midnight rendezvous
with a tree. Doug Drabek’s inability to
buy. ta . win/. Barry ‘lfonds’ hate-hate
relationship with his bat. It’s enough to

‘ drive a rotisserie team owner completely
crazy. i
- The way these leagues work vary greatly.
I The league I will be discussing is a simple,
low-maintenance one. There are seven
teams. The teams were picked by a draft,
and all players from both leagues were
, eligible. _
E Each participant drafted 30 players.

Each team is required to have two players

, at every inﬁeld position, including catcher,
and ﬁve outfielders, a designated hitter,
five, starting pitchers and four relief
pitchers.

‘ The remaining five players are bench
players, and their stats do not count. The
teams compete in 10 different categories.
Six are batting: batting average, runs
scored, home runs, runs batted in, walks
and steals. Four are pitching: wins, earned
run average, saves and strikeouts. If a
team wins a category, then it gets seven
points. If it finishes last, it gets one point.
Only the stats at the end of the season
count, and whoever gets the most, points

‘ wins. V 6%

Near the end of the summer, teams
protect 25 players, and the rest, including
players who went undrafted, are put in a
supplemental draft.

But enough of this boring technical
stuff. Here are some helpful rules for
people in rotisserie leagues.

Rule #1: Starting pitching will break
your heart. The most inconsistent position
is starting pitching, with the exceptions of
Roger Clemens, Dwight Gooden and
Nolan Ryan. ‘

A pitcher could win 20 games one
season with an ERA in the twos, and the
next year win 1 1 with an ERA in the high
threes.

Look at Drabekl He had a record of 22-

6 last year with a 2.76 ERA. This year? 1- ~

6 with a 3.65 ERA. Of course, it’s still early
in the season, so he might improve. Of
course, it can go the other way as well.
Zane Smith was 5-10 with a 4.3 ERA--in
1988 and ,1-13 with a 3.49 ERA in 1989. In
1990, however, Smith had a 12-9 record
with a 2.55 ERA, and this year he is 4-1
with a 2.06 ERA. ’ \

However, people very rarely pick up a
player like Smith in 1988 or 1989 in a
rotisserie, so you are more likely to pick
up Drabek and have him rip your heart
out. So, ‘draft a lot of pitchers, and draft
most of them in the lower rounds.

Rule #2; Injuries are the worst. I know
this rule too personally. Guess who had
Dykstra on his team? The only advice here
is to try and avoid players with past injury
problems, but that won’t protect you against
car crashes. _

Rule #3: Draft players who hit third in

their team’s lineup. Players who bat third.

usually have a good combination of power

and speed, and since they bat third, they

will collect a lot of runs and RBIs.

A player_ who is good in all the
categories, like an Andy Van Slyke, is
more valuable than a player who is great
in one, two or three categories,like a Rob
Deer.

Rule #4: Rule # 3 doesn’t apply to stolen
bases. Because very few players can steal
bases effectively, players who excel in this
category are valuable, especially if they
play a weak position, like shortstop, where
only a few players are superstars. Still, you
don’t draft these players too early.

And now, for the busts and booms so far
this season: _

Booms: Dennis Martinez, Dave
Henderson (unpicked),. Duane Ward
(unpicked), Cal Ripken, Edgar Martinez,
John Smiley, Tom Candiotti, Hal Morris
and Ivan Calderon. ‘

Busts: Bonds, Van Slyke, Drabek, Ron
Gant, Von Hayes, Darryl Strawberry, Glenn
Davis, Kevin McReynolds, Matt Williams,
Kent Hrbek and Gregg Olson.

It’s still early in the season, so maybe
some of these busts and booms will trade
places before the season is done.

Sean Gilbert (91) sat out most of last season because of a knee injury.

Gilbert brings enthusiasm to team

By Brandy L. Simms
Staff Writer ’

Next season, P_itt’s opposing quarterbacks can look forward to facing Sean
Gilbert, the mammoth 6-foot'—6-inch, 290-pound defensive lineman who suffered
a season-lingering knee injury prior to last year’s game against Syracuse. A

Because of the injury, he missed action for the next five weeks.

“Sean’s biggest problem is he got hurt-last year, and he didn’t have a chance
to really develop,” said Coach Paul Hackett. _

Coming out of Aliquippa High School, Gilbert was highly touted, receiving
numerous national awards including the honor of being named as the 1988 USA
TodayNational Defensive Player of the Year. He was also a Paitade All-American
and a two-time Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Fabulous 22 selection. _

“I think more than anything else,‘ he brings a lot of enthusiasm,” said Hackett.

Gilbert said he’s getting better. —‘.‘My improvement has been good on my part
because I had to sit out a year, and when I came back, I was still young, and I
needed to play in some games to get experience, but injuries started that to be
delayed. But as far as playing ball is going, I think I’ve been taking care of business
so far,” said Gilbert.
