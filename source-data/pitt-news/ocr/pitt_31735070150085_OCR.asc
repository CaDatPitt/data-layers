Even as the country’s first black
president ﬁnishes his ﬁrst term,
a member of the Texas A&M Uni-
versity faculty argued that sys-
temic and institutionalized rac-
ism is still a devastating issue in
America. .

Joe Feagin, a professor of so-
ciology at Texas A&M Univer-
sity, gave a talk titled “Obama’s
Campaigns and Presidency: No
Post—Racial America” yesterday
in the School of Social Work’s
conference center on the 20th
floor of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. Feagin spoke as part of an
annual lecture series hosted
by the school’s‘ Center on Race
and Social Problems. The series
deals with racial problems in the
United States and is currently in
its 11th year.

Feagin’s remarks began at
noon and lasted for an hour
and a half, including a Q—and—A
session. He discussed at le'ngth
evidence for what he called sys-
temic racism within the United
States, citing both historical evi-
dence and evidence from Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s own ca-
reer. He asserted that systemic

racism has been part of the U.S. A

since the beginning of its history
and that American political and
social institutions still serve the
interests of a white elite.

Larry Davis, dean of the

School of Social Work and direc-

tor of the Center on Race and
Social Problems, greeted the
audience and gave credit toiBu-
chanan, Ingersoll 8: Rooney PC
for sponsoring the lecture se-
ries, adding that most law ﬁrms
would avoid such controversial

issues. He also noted that inter-
est in Feaginis work had more
than ﬁlled the seating in the con-
ference center.

Joyce Bell, assistant, profes-
sor at the School of Social Work,
took the stage after Davis to’in-
troduce Feagin, discussing his
many accomplishments, includ-
ing the nomination of his 1973
book, “Ghetto Revolts,” for a P_u—
litzer Prize. 2

Early in his lecture, Feagin

stated, “We are by no means a
post-racial society.”
, Feagin laid out his argument
largely along chronological
lines, beginning with the fram-
ers of the Constitution, point-
ing out that all were white men.
Additionally, he said that 40
percent of those framers owned
slaves and wrote racism into
that document. As an example,
he pointed out blatant racism
in Thomas ]efferson’s writing.
Feagin went on to say Ameri-
cans often ignore such historical
truths.

Feagin focused on the ex-
ample of Frederick Douglass,
who escaped slavery to become
a pre-eminent writer and ora-
tor of his time. Feagin discussed
a speech in which Douglass at-
tacked the institution of slavery
by explaining that to a slave, the
praise of Americans for prin-
ciplesglike liberty and equality
would sound like “swelling van-
ity” and “hollow mockery.” Dou-

glass described Americans as"

unrivaled in “revolting barbarity
and shameless hypocrisy.”
“Some of these strong words
still describe our society today,”
Feagin said.
Feagin went on to cite the

RACE —

makeup of present-day Congress, whose
membership is overwhelmingly white and
male, as further evidence of institutional-
ized racism. The Senate —— 96 percent of
which is white and in which only 17 wom-
en serve — particularly reﬂects for Feagin
the dominance of an elite comprised of
white men. '

While the . Democratic party“ has ‘be-

come more diverse -since the repeal of l

the Jim Crow laws in the 1960’s, Feagin
argued the Republican party continues to
favor the interests of white men.

Feagin also said that voting trends, in-
cluding statistics from the 2008 presiden-
tial election, reﬂect a society fragmented

by race. Hispanic and African-American _
voters overwhelmingly supported Obama, —

while Sen. John McCain’s base of support
was almost entirely white.
“Obama has been forced by this reality

to operate as an outsider within,” Feagin
said. ’

Feagin said this status has forced
Obama to compromise with the white
elite in his policies. It has also made him
the target of racist attacks, both overt and
otherwise.

Feagin pointed to -the presence of _

websites with names like Niggermania
and Your Nigger President. Additional
evidence of Americans’ private racism in-
cludes millions of searches forjﬂokes‘ that
include that same pejorative term, often
along with the president’s name.

Feagin singled out as an example one
chief ‘federal district judge who was ex-
posed for having sent an offensive joke
about both the president and his mother
via email. The judge, he said, sent the joke
from a court building and email address.

Feagin said that Obama will again need
minority voters if he is to win re-election.
However, he pointed to‘ recent legisla-
tion such as voter ID laws, including the
one enacted in Pa., as evidence that white

conservatives seek to suppress minority
voters. - '

Following his remarks, Feagin invited
the audience to ask questions.

Seth Beckerman, a former faculty
member at Washington State University
who currently works as a freelance writer
and editor, was one of those who spoke
up. He asked about the link between the
American educational system and sys-
temic racism. ‘

“One of the casualties of our political
system has been critical thinking,” said
Feagin, beginning his reply to Beckerman.

He elaborated by saying that American
schools teach a historical narrative that
ignores the faults and inherent racism of
American institutions and of Thomas Jef-

ferson and other founders. He said these-

founders left African-Americans and
other minorities out of many of the ide-
als they claimed they served when fram-
ing the Constitution. School curricula also
ignore many of the achievements of non-
whites in the nation’s progress.

 

“Blacks have ' made huge contribu-
tions in pushing this country, kicking and
screaming,‘ towards making that [consti-
tutional] framing a reality,” he said.

Speaking after the lecture, Beckerman

.echoed many of Feagin’s statements.

“I think many of the things [Feagin]

T was talking about reﬂect the failure of our

educational system to teach critical think-

ing,” Beckerman said.

Despite the weighty nature of the talk,
Beckerman felt that it was constructive
and reminded Americans to keep working
for racial equality.’ '

“[Feagin] highlighted not only how far
we’ve come, but how far we have to go,”
Beckerman said. \

. But ‘not all attendees agreed with ‘

Feagin. ,
When he called on one middle—aged

member of the audience seated near the‘

podium who had raised his hand, the man
began to say that he took exception to’

to Pitt,” Duffy said. “When I realized
it didn’t ex-ist, I wondered how hard it
would be to start one up.” ’

The formation of the club resulted
from a series of emails between Tide-
man, Duffy and the national represen-
tatives of IJM.

“Katie and I are from the same area
—— we went to‘ the same church,” Tide-
man said. “We contacted IJM separately
to find out how to setup a college chap-
ter, and they emailed both of us.”

Maggie To, the club’s vice president,
also got involved in a similar way.

“IJM emailed me because I’d ex-

pressed interest,” To said.

IJM’s cause fits in with interests that
To cultivated while spending this past
summer volunteering in Faridabad, In-
dia. There, she interned at local hospi-
tals and taught English in impoverished
schools. .

“I’ve become increasingly more pas-
sionate about issues like sex trafficking
and women’s rights,” she said.

In addition to raising awareness
about specific issues such as these, the
group officers hope their message of
promoting international justice will get
across to students.

“I think [the mission is] just to make
people care in a way that is more per-

- to work to inform

sonal,” Tideman said. “Everyone knows
about these things, but it’s hard to make
it matter in our lives as college students.
Even if it’s on a small scale, getting in-
volved can show that it is of major im-
portance in your life.” _

The group members don’t want to
narrow their focus

the information will be a huge help.”
The club is still new, as it gained of-
ficial recognition from the University
in June after months of working on the
group constitution.
“We were trying to work within the

example how IJM

munities.

“We want to be
the kind of group
that doesn’t force
a lot of responsibility on people,” Tide-

have an effect, but it’s limited.”

Tideman also recognized that the is-
sues they will work to raise awareness
of through IJM are often very disturb-
ing, but she ‘said her group would work
to take a more positive angle on the sub-
jects. ' j _ .

T “I think if we can keep a positive

social implications, we can raise aware-
ness and also enjoy getting to know the
people who join the group,” Tideman
said. “I would love to have an event that
would be really fun or cultural to raise
awareness.”

The first official club meeting - is
scheduled for Sept. 20, at which time of-
ficers said they will have a more defini-
tive number for how many members are

l in their organization. However, they did

get over 60 potential members to sign
up at the Activities Fair on August 26 at
the Petersen Events Center.

While the officers do not yet have
speciﬁc plans for events — it will de-
pend on member input, according to
Tideman —— they do have ideas for ways
students can start furthering IJM’s mis-
sion.

“One thing students can do is buy
products that are fair trade,” Hughes
said. “Buying things that are made in
America is important. Buying things 10-
cally is very important.”

Fair trade products are made in good
working conditions without the use of
child labor or sweatshops.

The group would also like to show
students how human trafficking and
slavery can be influenced by college stu-
dents in America. _

“It’s easy enough to feel bad or sad

' for these people, but doing something

like this could make a lot of difference,”
Duffy said. I

rector of the Center, who had moved to

reminded the man to keep his comments
civil as murmurs from the audience for
the man to stop increased in number and

member wondered out loud why there
was no security to eject him.

Finally, the heckler angrily stood up,
shouldering a backpack and holding his
white bicycle helmet by its chin strap.

“Enjoy the problem that you will nev-
er solve-because you will never face it,”
the man said as he left the room and his

After the lecture, Davis could not help
but chuckle when he said that several

other attendees, citing the heckler’s ex—'

 

aggerated demeanor, asked whether he
had been planted in the audience to dem-
onstrate a point. Davis emphasized that
he was not, and had in fact disrupted an-
other lecture in the series earlier this year.
However, Davis said that such disruptions
remind him to keep working.

“If it were not for people like [the heck-
ler], we wouldn’t have these events,” he
said.

of the audience wanted to hear Feagin
speak. Shon Owens, Jonathan Pettis and

ed yesterday’s talk. They havelattended
several other lectures in the series and
heard Feagin speak once before, during
the Center on Race and Social Problems’s

Owens believed that Feagin shared
some of his own views on racial inequality
and was impressed by the degree to which
Feagin researched his arguments.

“It is very much what African—Amer-
icans have been trying to articulate for
years,” Owens said. “African-Americans
have been saying the same things behind
closed doors and at the water cooler for

.years, and he’s articulating them at the

national level.”

King said that she appreciated the op-
portunity to hear Feagin again and valued
his work.

“You ﬁnd someone that dedicated
and committed to truth—seeking, and you
know it takes courage,” she said. I

Columnist _

Enter two girls, both sophomores
in college. Relationship: lived on
the same ﬂoor in the residence hall
the previous year. Generic “Happy
birthday!” Facebook wall posts
were exchanged over the summer.

They converse brieﬂy. It’s just
small talk. And then:

“Oh my gosh, it was so good

running into you!”

“Yeah, we have to get lunch
soon!”

“Absolutely, girl! Text me!” ,

“Will do!” ‘

It’s awkward. One girl wonders
if the other will actually text her to
plan something. Simultaneously,
she wonders if she should be the
one to initiate. “Was she just say-
ing that to be polite‘? Would she
actually want to get lunch with
me?” Comparable to questioning

' the meaning of life, no answer will

suffice.

If the date, time and place

aren’t immediately determined,
assume that they never will be.
Why? Because these girls are
merely acquaintances.

V For some reason, we feel
obliged to advance our relation-
ships to a level where getting to-
gether for meals is the norm. This

is one step too far. Everyone can
enjoy acquaintances without hav-
ing to go the extra step into lunch
date territory. -

They are accessories to your
group of party—goers. Someone’s
roommate. Afriend’s friend who is

’ visiting for the weekend. She may

have been cool, or maybe" the two
of you were the only ones at the
bar who knew every single word to
Nicki Minaj’s “Starships” rap.
But where did she go to high
school? What’s her dogs name?
No idea. -

Whenlthese simple ‘facts can «

not be answered about someone,
assume they are merely an ac-
quaintance. Do not, while brieﬂy
chatting at a crosswalk, try to
jump to the lunch-date level of

- friends with this person! To reach

the lunch date, you. have to bridge
the gap.

And if you do ﬁnd yourself
wanting to jump from acquain-
tance to friend, there are a few tac-
tics you can-employ.

1. Start small. Pick something
quick in the middle of the day,
such as coffee. If you need to bail

makes sense for you to have to

class or meet your group for a
project somewhere very far away.

Nobody will know the difference.

2. Be speciﬁc. Rather than say-
ing, “We have to get lunch soon,”
use actual times and dates. “Do
you have a break in your sched-
ule on Wednesday? We should get
lunch!” Otherwise, the likelihood
of these vague plans occurring is
incredibly low. '

3. Use the Internet. Seriously,
no matter how much I hate it,
Facebook chat might be one of the
best options for planning" things.
Now that the chat feature is creep-
ier than ever, you will see when the
other person has viewed the mes-
sage. They’re at their computer
and can easily look into this week’s

4. Keep it casual. Never, under
any circumstances, start conver-
sations about politics, religion or
other controversial topics with
someone you don’t know very
well. This normally goes without
saying, but think about other awk-
ward chats. That girl from your

Dan Shapiro
For The Pitt News

Freshman year is convenient. If you are liv-

V ing in or near the quad, you are in the center

of campus. Everything is within reach, and
at most, it takes ﬁve minutes to get to class.
Fast-forward to sophomore or junior year,
and now you reside in one of the beautiful
neighborhoods of North or South Oakland.
Suddenly, you have to wake up half an hour
earlier than last year and often end up arriv-

‘ing to class out of breath. Parking spaces are
lacking or too expensive to ﬁt within your '

narrow budget. Fortunately, there is a way to
get around these problems: bring your bike.
_ For. most people, the thought of cycling
 5"Cl§7%.'.-1l?“Stll!3£'—- , ,
 ‘little  forfpédestrian safety -
prevents them from ever bringing a bike to
campus. However, those brave enough can
easily reduce their travel time by half.
Although Pitt is located in a particularly
hilly city, its campus is relatively ﬂat (unless
you’re a chemistry, dentistry, pharmacy or
nursing student — but why would you want
to be, _anyway?). If you are like me, and face
biking to class from North Oakland, you will

  

ﬁnd the ride surprisingly easy. There is no
need to develop a physical regimen to better
prepare yourself for the trek. It only takes

about ﬁve minutes to get from Centre Av-

enue to Posvar Hall, and you won’t ﬁnd any
challenging terrain along the way.

Along with distance, traffic is always a
major concern. The recent spate of biking
accidents in the city is especially alarming. If
you have ever seen Fifth Avenue during rush
hour, you might think twice before crossing
it — let alone riding alongside cars and bus-

es. Yet, by forgoing the large roads, much of

the dangers from drivers can be eliminated.
While traﬁic may be an issue that can
be tackled easily, the notorious Pittsburgh

winters, are anothergbeast entirely. Pitts-

of the winter, students get around either
by walking wrapped in layer upon layer of
sweatshirts and coats or via the only form
of heated transportation: overcrowded Port
Authority buses ﬁlled to the brim with ques-
tionable denizens giving you questionable
looks. Face it, you are going to spend most
of the dead of winter rolling around on these
rickety,«smelly petri dishes, so it would serve

you well to get as much fresh air as you can
while the weather is nice. This leaves you
with August through part of November and
then April onward to cram in as much biking
as possible. ’

So then, why are so many people discour-
aged from cycling around campus? Perhaps
it is the fear of being mocked by sneering pe-
destrians or cursing drivers.

But my ‘experience ﬁnds this fear rriis—
appropriated. I rarely incur any problems
with the ol’ten—friendly folk who commute
through Pittsburgh. In. fact, I have always
found them to be more than willing to share

the road. And as for those snarky pedestri-

ans, just remember that not only will you get

just like ﬁnding the right bus route to and
from your destination, it is important that
you map out your bike trip before embark-
ing. Find out which streets are the quick-
est and safest. I will offer you this piece of
advice: avoid Fifth Avenue at all costs. The

drivers are as unpredictable as the ﬂow of _

traﬂic and often more aggressive than on
side streets. Use the Bayard, O’Hara and

bi ke is easy
Bigelow conglomerate strip as your main
route; only cross onto Forbes or Fifth when
needed. This way, you will avoid traﬂic and
any possibility of ending up as a smear on a
windshield.

To increase bike safety, Pennsylvania
also recently passed the “safe passage” law,
which requires motorists to leave no less
than four feet between their cars and cy-
clists. While it is hard to believe that every
driver will adhere to this law, it is nonethe-
less comforting to know that the govem—
ment is invested in your safety.

While I cannot promise you that you will
avoid the ire of pedestrians and drivers alike,
I can say for sure that you will enjoy your
commute much more on a bicycle. Not only

I was disappointed by the publication of

Nick Stamatakis’s recent article regarding

the war on women.

His support for Republican efforts to
block equal pay for women cites only one
source, with manipulated statistics, that
still reveals a statistically—signiﬁcant pay
gap. His argument is based on. allegorical
theory about work habits largely built on
gender stereotypes.

He claims that this legislation requires
salaries be made public (untrue; it only
becomes disclosed privately in a lawsuit),

‘ then makes a leap in logic to say that doc-

umenting pay differences will bankrupt
businesses. Businesses of all sizes have
performance reviews and employee evalu-
ations; they already have the necessary
documentation. His argument has larger
implications than he realizes. Saying that
legislation fails a cost/beneﬁts test means

"LETTER TO THE ED1To_R

. that all anti-discrimination legislation —

including discrimination based on race
and disability -— are not worthwhile. This
type of larger implication betrays a lack of
thoughtﬁilness that should concern any
editor, regardless of political aﬂiliation.
Attacks on such a fundamental right as
a woman’s body and access to basic health
(yes, contraception has larger implications
to women’s health than just sex), is going to
incite pushback. ‘He notes that something
could be in the Republican platform with-
out being enacted. Though true in theory,

Romney selected Paul Ryan as a running.

ment removing a woman’s right to choose
even in cases of rape; this does set women
back. A V U ’
His discussion of contraception cover-
age ignores context. When Republicans
ﬁrst held a panel to discuss contraception

coverage, itincluded notla single woman.

_ Imagine: a discussion of women’s health

issues that did not involve the people most
affected! ‘

It also ignores the issue of religious free-
dom for employees. Removing the mandate
for contraception coverage allows compa-
nies to decide what birth control methods
are used by employees. An institution ex-
empting itself obstructs an employee’s ac-
cess to health methods aligned with their
own beliefs.

This article was written with poor ar-
gumentation, little facts, broad general-
izations and theoretical arguments. The
war on women does exist, and this article
should not have been published at such a
ﬁne University.

FOOTBALL

In search of ﬁrst iwin, Pitt prepares for Virginia Tech _    

Pcmt/vers, H0/eier. to renew rivalry on Saturday at Heinz Field

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

Pitt and Virginia Tech maintained a

ﬁerce Big East‘ rivalry on the football‘

ﬁeld until the Hokies left the conference
in 2004. .

Next year, the two football programs
will again compete in a shared confer-
ence, once Pitt’s move to the Atlantic
Coast Conference is ﬁnalized. But for
now, the Panthers (0-2, 0-1 Big East)

A and the Hokies (2-0, 1-0 ACC) will re-

new their rivalry with a nonconference
matchup this Saturday at noon at Heinz
Field. T

After Pitt’s embarrassing 35-10 defeat

at Cincinnati last week, new head coach 5

Paul Chryst still searches for his ﬁrst win
as the leader of the University’s football
program.

At his weekly press conference,
Chryst admitted the season hasn’t yet
gone as he would’ve liked, but he said

1‘ he’s still excitedfor the matchup with

the Hokies.

“What a great opportunity we have
this week,” he said of facing Virginia
Tech. “Our kids realize that, and I think
they «look forward‘to the challenge.”

No. 13 Virginia Tech this Saturdayat-noon. Bobby Mizia | Senior Staff Photographer

Led by longtime head coach Frank
Beamer, the No._13 Hokies have started
the season with two victories.

On Labor Day evening, Virginia Tech

came from behind against Georgia Tech
in the last seconds to force overtime,
where the Hokies eventually prevailed,-

20-17. And after that exciting win, Beam-.

 

er’s_ squad easily handled FCS—school
Austin Peay last weekend, 42-7, to re-
main undefeated.

Although Virginia Tech leads the all- A

time series against Pitt 7-4, the Panthers
have won the last three contests between

the "programs, includingra memorable’

31-28 upset in 2003.

Because of that history, Beamer said ‘

his team will not take its opponent ‘this
week lightly.

WOMEN’S SOCCER

Panthers unravel in second half, drop Big East opener

Jasper Wilson
/Issistam‘ Sports Editor

The Pitt women’s soccer team received a
harsh wake~up call on Thursday night.

In its Big East opener, Pitt fell to No. 24
Marquette in a rout, 5-1, at the Petersen

" Sports Complex. After tying the program

record for nonconference victories last
weekend, the Panthers appeared morose
and unable to compete with the Golden
Eagles’ attack.

Looking overmatched for the majority

' . of the game, Pitt (5-5, 0-1 Big East) rarely

advanced out of its defensive third, and
when itdid, often couldn’t maintain pos-
session long enough to mount a serious
attack.

The total domination of the game by
Marquette manifested itself from the

 opening whistle, as the Golden Eagles'out

shot the Panthers 17-2 in the ﬁrst half.
Marquette’s (4—2—1, 1-0 Big East) abso-
lute control of play didn’t go unnoticed by

ﬁrst-year Pitt head coach Greg Miller.

“I think we just got a little ﬂustered at
the beginning,” Miller said. “We just spent
a lot of the game reacting and unfortunate-
ly spent a lot of the game giving the ball
away.”

The second half offered little respite for
the Panthers.

Pitt redshirt sophomore goalkeeper Ni-
cole D’Agostino stayed busy all night with
the Golden Eagles swinging in numerous
crosses and ﬁring dozens of shots.

Marquette wasted no time in adding to
its lead after the break as Rachel Brown
turned and scored a stunning goal in the
53rd minute. Well outside the box, Brown
placed the ball immaculately in the top
corner, and the diving effort of D’Agostino
couldn’t alter its path.

Pitt then orchestrated a couple of at-
tacks, which ﬁnally put Marquette under
pressure. '

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

Strong defense makes Rutgers
favorite to win conference  

Syracuse star quarteback Ryan Nassib almos led the Orage to an upset victory over

No.2 Southern californiaiast weekend, but his team dropped to 0-2-. MCT Campus

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

The Big East entered this past weekend.

with three opportunities to knock off BCS
teams — two were against Atlantic Coast
Conference teams, which raided the Big
East again on Wednesday when Notre
Dame announced its pending move to the
ACC. '
But unfortunately for the Big East, its
members went 0-3 in those BCS_ matchups.
Connecticut’s offense was stiﬂed by
North Carolina State in a 10-7 loss, Tem-

'p1e gave up 36 points in a loss to Maryland,

and Syracuse fought valiantly but fell, 42-

* 29, to No. 2 Southern California. Those de-

feats do nothing to help a conference with
an already poor football reputation.
Heading into a week where Louisville,
which has the only Big East win against a
BCS team this year, takes on North Caro-
lina, and Pitt hosts Virginia Tech, here are

my weekly rankings of the eight Big East

football teams’: -
1. Rutgers

The conference’s best defense contin-

ues to hold the top ranking in this week’s’

breakdown.
The Scarlet Knights got their ﬁrst shut-
out in a 26-0 win over Howard,_and junior

running back Jawan Jamison had his sec— -

ond 100-yard game of the season. But the
defense’s stellar performance showed why
Rutgers feels like it can win the Big East
this season.

Although yet to face quality-competi—’

tion, Rutgers’ defense is fourth in the na-
tion in points allowed.

2. Louisville

The Cardinals took care of business

l

again in week two, defeating Missouri’

State easily, 35-7. » .

Sophomore quarterback Teddy Bridge-
water had another excellent day — going
3o—for-39 for 344 yards with two touch-
downs —- and he appears to be the early
front-runner for Big East Offensive Player
of the Year.

This week’s test against North Carolina

. will show just how good the Cardinals are.

l 3. South Florida 3

USF didn’t beat a BCS team in its week-
two game, but the Bulls downed a quality
football team in Nevada on the road.

In the tight 32-31 victory, USF quarter-
back B.J. Daniels threw his third touch-
down toss of the game — a 56-yarder —
with 38 seconds" remaining. The senior
passed for 363 yards in the victory, but the
Bulls have yet to develop a balanced rush-
ing attack, which could hurt them in Big
East play.

4. Cincinnati

The Bearcats looked impressive in their
win over Pitt last week, although junior
quarterback Munchie Legaux missed sev-
eral open receivers. And against tougher
competition, those mistakes will come
back to hurt the Cincinnati quarterback.

Cincinnati will look to keep its con-
ﬁdence level high against FCS opponent
Delaware State this weekend before its
showdown with~No. 13 Virginia Tech.

5. Syracuse
Despite their 0-2 record, the Orange
have looked pretty good this season.
Syracuse played Northwestern to the

SOCCER :

The Panthers struggled to produce any offenselagainst the Guided Eagles on Thursday
night at/the Petersen Sports Complex. Huailei Wang | Senior Staff Photographer

Senior forward Ashley Cuba ran diago-
nally onto a through ball and smartly hit
it off her defender to win a corner — Pitt’s
ﬁrst of the game.

Junior defender Morgan Sharick met
the service with a powerful header, and the
ball rocketed into the net. It was Sharick’s
fourth goal of the year, all of which have
come off corners. Freshman Roosa Arvas
tallied the assist, her seventh of the year.

The goal seemed to energize the Pan-

thers, who pressed higher up and attacked 1

with purpose.

It wouldn’t last, though, as Marquette’s
Maegan Kelly slid a ball past a helpless
D’Agostino to push the Golden Eagles’ ad-
vantage to 3-1.

Pitt appeared deﬂated after conceding
a third goal, and Marquette seized the op-
portunity by adding two more goals late in
the contest to make the game a blowout.

Miller wasn’t happy with his team’s de-
fensive lapses at the end of the game.

“We gave up three goals in eight min-
utes because of our lack of attention to de-
tail and falling asleep,” he said. “We have
to manage the game for longer periods of
time instead of taking breaks.”

Marquette ﬁnished with 34 shots to
Pitt’s six.

Cuba stated‘ that Sharick’s goal gave Pitt
belief that it could equalize, but she admit-
ted the Panthers were fatigued.

“It’s a huge mentality thing,” Cuba said.
“After that ﬁrst goal, I think it gave us some
momentum towards getting a second one.
[But] after a while, we just got tired and
broke down.” .

For Sharick, the team’s early jitters and
subsequent lack ofcomposure kept it from
putting together more attacks of its own.

“A big thing for us is sometimes we pan— P

ic in the middle, and as soon as we get it
out wide. And when you’re playing against
a formation like Marquette had, we had
numbers out wide, and we had the space
out wide,” Sharick said. “If we can get the
ball to [our dynamic players], we can get in
on goal and get service.” _

The junior defender also believes the
Panthers’ troubles in open play place an
added importance on not wasting set piec-
es. -
“Sometimes we struggle on the ﬁeld
to get shots off and get shots in the run of
play,’’ Sharick said. “So honestly, when we
get [free kicks or corner kicks] everyone is
excited, because we know that that is one

of our strengths, and we need to make ev-

eryone count.”

With the team’s next game at South
Florida on Sunday quickly approaching,
Cuba knows the team can’t afford to dwell
on this disappointing, lopsided result.

“We just got to put it behind us,” she
said. “It’s in the past.” I -

football players,” Beamer said of Pitt.
“We have always had respect from them,
have respect for them‘
now.” ' p '

But with how much the Panthers
struggled in their opening- two games,
the Hokies enter Saturday’s showdown
as heavy favorites.

If Pitt hopes to have any chance of.
pulling off the upset, the Panthers’ de-
fense —— which conceded a combined
66 points against Youngstown State. and
Cincinnati — must improve.

“It’s tough. We’ve got to learn from’

it,” senior safety Jarred Holley said after
the Cincinnati game about the defense’s
poor performance. “All of the guys are
trying really hard — we just have to get
things together.” '

And against the Hokies, the task won’t
be any easier with athletic, 6-foot-6,
260-pound quarterback Logan Thomas
leading Virginia Tech’s explosive attack.

“I think he’s a very impressive quar-
terback,” Chryst said of Thomas. ‘(‘There’s
no way we can mimic [him in practice.]
We don’t have a guy on our scout team
that is that size and plays quarterback.
We’ll do our best in preparing for it, but
he certainly is a gifted and talented quar-
terback.” ’

Virginia Tech’s talented offense will

challenge the Panthers defense, so Pitt’s
offense must ﬁnd a way to score points

i when it has the opportunity to do so.
Quarterback .Tino Sunseri admitted

that 2-for-4 in the red zone last week.

against the Bearcats just wasn’t good
enough for Pitt. '

“Whenever you drive down the ﬁeld,
you haveito be able to cash in inside the
20-yard line,” the senior passer said.

Chryst believes that despite the early

' struggles, his team. still has confidence
that it can turn this season around,‘ be-
ginning this week. ' ’

. “This group cares. You just _focus ori ‘

things you can control,” he said. “Right
now,-I don’t feel like it’s a team in fragile
state of mind.” I '

BREAKDOWN F

wire and lost by less than two touchdowns
against national~championship contender
USC_last weekend. _ ‘

Senior quarterback Ryan Nassib is third
in the nation in passing yards, and if Syra-
cuse had played two easy games to start the
season, it wouldbe 2-0 and getting men-
tions for the top spot. Look out for the Or-
ange'in the coming weeks. i’ F

 Connecticut

Offensively, the Huskies struggled in
the 10-7 loss to North Carolina State.

Sophomore quarterback Chandler
Whitmer tossed three interceptions, and
running back Lyle McCombs averaged only
three yards per carry as UConn failed to
move the ball consistently.- ~ — - .

The Connecticut defense" kept the team If

in the game, but the offense is far behind.

7. Temple

A 36-27 loss to an ACC team shouldn’t
be that demoralizing for a Big East team —

especially one that’s just returning to the _

conference;

However, it is a’ badlloss when it’s
against a Maryland team that only beat
FCS—school William 8: Mary by one point
"last week. A ‘V

The Owls, who remain the only major
college football program in the state of
Pennsylvaniawith a win, travel to Penn
'State this weekend. -

8. Pittsburgh

Down two touchdowns in the ﬁrst ﬁve
minutes against Cincinnati, the Panthers
were never able to recover.

Pitt showed signs of life several times,
but wasted red-zone opportunities, and
defensive lapses condemned the Panthers
to their second straight embarrassing de-
feat. ‘

With the Panthers’ toughest opponent

‘ ‘ of the season in Virginia Tech coming to

town this Saturday, Coach Paul Chryst’s
squad will likely startthe campaign 0-3. ﬂ
