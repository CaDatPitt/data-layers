SOME DAY, somewhere in the future, the columns will be
added. The ﬁnal tabulations willbe made and virtue will be
weighed on the scales against evil.

When that reckoning is made, when the ﬁgures have been
totaled, the wise men will look at the twentieth century.

They will frown and they will shrug their shoulders and
commit their computations to the pit.

Here, they will say, was, the great Age of The Paradox;
here was the ﬂood-day in which‘the‘,'t!idal wave of the objective

National Guardsmen Complete

The University was evacuated
Monday by the 120 members of the

massed One Hundred and Seventy-

Sixth ﬁeld artillery of the Pennsyl-
vania National Guard, who for the
past ten days had been using Ca-
thedral classrooms and part of
Alumni hall for preliminary train-
inghpurposes before leaving for
Camp’ George Meade. -  ‘

Since the University had no
scheduled classes between the last
day of ﬁnal examinations and last
Monday, space for the men was
available, and was placed at the

disposal of National Guard author-

ities.

The redecorated part of Alumni
hall, currently being used as a
chemistry laboratory, was used as
sleeping quarters for the men, while
tactical instruction was carried on
in the Cathedral classrooms.

Defense Body
Expands W7ork

Plans for expansion of the work
of the College division of the Com-
mittee to Defend America by Aid-
ing the Allies were discussed at a
meeting of the Pittsburgh group
last Sunday at committee headquar-
ters. The meeting, presided over
by William L. Klinkenstein, C42,
was addressed by Gilmore Stott,
national director of the College di-
vision.

Mr. Stott, a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Cincinnati in 1938 and
Rhodes scholar from Ohio at Ox-
ford during 1938 through 1940,
spoke on the protection of social
and economic gains as an important
factor in the program of the coin-
mittee.

“Increasing production with sac-
riﬁce according to the ability to
incur it will be the job of the
United States as soon as the lend-
lease gill» is passed,” the speaker
declared. “Once the bill is approv-
ed, the plans are on paper, and it is
ourimportant job to see that they
are pushed through with the great-
est possible speed.”

Student and faculty representa-
tives from the University and Car-
negie Tech attended the meeting.

Hearts to Hop
Friday Night

Hearts will palpitate ‘C0 the
rhythm of Bill Leroy and his Town
Tattlers Friday at the informal
Heart Hop in the main ballroom of
Hotel Schenley. Dancing will con-
tinue from 9 till 1 o’clock.

A huge stuffed heart “which real-
ly palpitates” and a love story told
in silhouettes against a background
of mirrors will provide the theme
of decorations, promises Kitty
Koontz, C41, chairman. Silhouettes
of romantic couples through the
ages will also welcome the dancers
at the only informal girl—take-man
affair of the year.

Tickets. priced at $1.75 a couple,
may be purchased from any mem-
ber of the committee, at the oﬁice
of the dean of men or dean of
women, or at the ground floor
booth. Charlotte Harris, C42, is
business manager.

 Use of Cathedral Classrooms

Of the remainder of the regiment,
not quartered at the University,
some were housed in private homes
in the Oakland district, and the rest
in Logan armory, which also served
as the seat of administrative activi-
ties ior the regiment.

The scene of men in uniform
about the Cathedral, older faculty
members said, was reminiscent of
the First World war, when Univer-
sitv buildings were used for bar-
racks during a similar training pe-
riod. At that time temporary bar-
racks were constructed on Univer-
sity property to house troops, in-
cluding those ~studen~ts who had been
called into service.

The buildings that were con-
structed for that purpose were used
for chemistry and physics labora-
tories until this month, when plans
for their destruction got underway.

And she doesn’t like the idea!

“Why don’t they do something
about it?” she pleaded. “If some

soon, well just have to move to
another office in order to make
room for the boxes filled with
these items.”

They’re pretty, too.

All colors, sizes, fabrics, de-

“If any students or faculty
members have lost gloves, mit-
tens,, or a scarf during the ﬁrst

Svendsen requested, “We may
have them.”

If they aren’t called for within
about two weeks, they’ll have to
be given to the Goodwill indus-

much exhausted.

Production to Begin

On ‘Head over Heels’

Cap and Gown will begin pro-
duction of its thirty-fourth annual
all-male production, “Head over
Heels,” on Friday with a call for
200 ‘necessary applicants, Frank
Mateer, C41, production manager,
has announced.

Registration booths for under-
graduate men who desire cast,
chorus, and the various behind-the-
scene jobs for the Nixon—presented
production may ﬁll in their tripli-
cate application blanks from 1. to
4:30 on Friday, and again on Mon-
day during the same hours, Mateer
said.

Newcomers Wanted

Men without experience or ability
on the stage are welcome to apply
since there are several positions to
be ﬁlled in the production staffs,
Gene Tedick, C41, business, mana-
ger, and E. Seymour Kerber, C41,
publicity manager, stated.

Meanwhile Graduate Manager
Theodore W. Biddle stated that “the
question of publication of Cap and
Gown music has not been settled.”
The ASCAP-BMI situation has af-
fected Cap and Gown since last
year’s publisher of C&G music,
Thornton Allen, is a member of
ASCAP.

Registration Required

Edwin Trembath, BA41,
dent of the Undergraduate Cap and
Gown club, honorary organization
for C&Gers, has notiﬁed all mem-
bers of his organization that they
must sign applications if they ex-
pect to be in this year’s show.
“Membership in the Undergraduate
C&G club or previous C&G expe-
rience is no guarantee of a place in
the show. _Fveryone should sign up
and tryout,” Trembath said; ~-.

The earlier applications are sub-
mitted, the sooner tryouts can be
held and the show placed in produc-

Hospitalization

Plan Extemded

By U niversity
Semester’s Deadline

Set for February 23

Lifting the barrier that banned
late first semester registrants irom

"enrolling in the group hospitaliza-
‘tion insurance plan introduced on

campus last spring, Dr. H. C. Carl-
son announced Monday that “new
applicants, as well as those already
protected under the plan may take
out policies for the second se-
lmester.”

V» Protection under the plan, co-
sponsored by the Pitt News and
includes
l‘-.:an1ong other services, 21 free days

fiat any of western Pennsylvania’s

79 hospitals. Cost is $2.50 each se-
mester. This amount is payable at
‘the treasurer’s office in State hall.

W Deadline‘ for this semester’s pay-
.mer-t is February 28, Dr. Carlson
lemphasized.

Services given during serious ill-
ness to members of the plan in-
clude:

(1) Room and board in ward
accommodations for a total of 21
days each school year in any of
western Pennsylvania’s 79 hos-
gpitals.

* The student may select accom-
imodations in a private or a semi-
“private room with an allowance of

$3 a day toward the purchase of

‘these better accommodations.
presi- I

(2) Use of the operating room
as often as necessary.
(3) Anesthesia as often as nec-

1 essary.

Points two and three are out-
standing beneﬁts in the University
plan, since many other hospitaliza-

wtion plans call for the use of the

operating room and anesthesia only
once during a conﬁnement.

(4) Ordinary drugs and medi-
cations.

(5) Necessary dressings and
casts. ‘

’(6) Routine laboratory services.

'(7) Ordinary x-ray.

Non-Fraternity Students

The ﬁrst plan in the history of the University to unify all non-frater-
nity students was launched last week with the creation of the campus’
newest organization, Independent association.‘

Originated by two Independent seniors, Fred Robie, C, and Dave

Tucker, C, the association is de-
signed to “offer a far reaching pro-
gram of educational and social
events to all non-fraternity men
and women on campus.”

The membership drive for the
group got underway during regis-
tration, when a booth was con-
structed in the elevator lobby,
which will be open every ﬁfth
hour for the next few weeks, said
Robie. '

Robie and Tucker stressed the
fact that there was no limitation
upon the membership of the or-
ganization and declared “there is
room in Independent association
for every non-fraternity man or
woman on campus.”

.One of the primary purposes is
an educational program, explained
Robie, “which will include forums
and discussion groups where non-
fraternity students can help others
in the solution of the many prob-
lems facing the independent Pitt
student.” "

“We plan to inaugurate our so-
cialprogram with a big dance, to
be held in Hotel Webster Hall on
1‘/larch '4',” Robie added.

“Our ultimate goal,” he declared,

“L

is L0 foster the interest of the non-

_fraternity man and woman on cam-

pus who are unable to enjoy the
privileges of any organized campus
group, social or otherwise.”

Batohelder Patiently Explains
IVhy of Blueprint Explanation

We were pretty insulted.

From the looks of our blueprint
the University didn’t think very
much of our memory. Economics
113 would have been enough. They
didn’t have to write Economics 113,
Contemporary Economic Systems.
After struggling through the course
for five months, we certainly knew
what kind of an economics course
it was.

I-lmph!
We went to see Mr. Batchelder.

Mr. Batchelder is very patient.

He explained that courses were
listed with descriptions at the re-
quest of the Department of Public
Instruction in Harrisburg. This
system makes it easier to evaluate
credits on the transcripts. They

in the catalogue that way. They
didn’t mean to insult us.

SF A Meetings

Student-Faculty association as-
sembly will hold. its first meeting of
the‘ semester this evening in 1217
Cathedral at 8 o’clock, according to
Joe Roberts, BA41, president.

Chief business on the agenda,
Roberts says, will be discussions on
the reports of the constitution com-
mittee, under the chairmanship of
Dave Tucker, C41, and on the sen-
ior announcements and senior me-
morial committees. Lewis Cox, C41,
has been appointed chairman of the
announcements committee.

The executive committee will
meet tomorrow, he revealed, but
said nothing of what would be dis-
cussed. At the last executive meet-

»ing‘the"systern of identiﬁcation at
spring elections was changed, Rob-
erts stated.

Instead of checking off student
voters by their SFA election cards,
ﬁlled out during registration, each
voter will now be required to pro-
duce an identiﬁcation card, which
will be punched when he has ﬁnish-

ed voting. ,,
Commenting on the new plan of
identiﬁcation, Fred Robie, C41,

member of the executive commit-
tee said, “After years of experi-
menting with other systems of
checking againstdouble voting, we
ﬁnd the one now instituted to be
most expedient.”

Identiﬁcation cards may be ob-
tained by those who do not already
have them at the oﬁice of the regis-
trar. The applicant must produce
his picture_, which will then be
placed on a card and properly
stamped.

College Offices . . .
and the offices of Dr. Stanton C.

Crawford, dean of the college, and
Dr. Omar C. Held, assistant dean,

‘have been temporarily transferred

to 1804 Cathedral.

All incoming freshmen and up-
per classmen interested in report-
ing, advertising or secretarial work

SFA: Governmerit or ‘Activity’?

(This is the last of four editorials analyz-
ing Pitt student government. Today we con-
tinue our discussion of Student Faculty asso-
ciation.)

VVE HAVE ALREADY pointed out that much
misunderstanding and criticism of SFA results
from confusing the type of work they are doing
with that which most people suppose they a-re
doing. We explained that although ten people
out of ten you ask on campus will tell you that
SFA is supposed to be the government for all-
University student activities, in actual practice
SFA primarily concerns itself with ‘the manage-
ment and operation of certain activities of its
own. SFA, as we saw it, is not a student—fac-
ulty legislature; it is a board of directors man-
aging a limited number of “private” enterprises.

A constitutional revision committee has been
appointed by this group “to secure better stu-
dent government.” They have asked» for sug-
gestions. These we continue today.

 >23 * =31 -5'1

We think the committee should pay regard to
these important considerations:

‘ 1. Does the present constitution set up SFA
as a policy-determining legislature for Pitt ac-
tivities or as an activity-sponsoring board of
administrators or as both?

2. If it is an activity-sponsoring agency,
does the present constitutional structure make
for the most efficient management of these‘?

We first suggest that the committee take a
gander-.»at the SFA by-laws. We took out our
much‘-unread Pitt compass the other day and
found them very enlightening if not surprising
reading. For nowhere in the entire constitution
isthere any mention of SFA as a student gov-
ernment either of the students or by the students
or for the students.

The spirit of the charter is embodied in arti-
clerwwo which states, -“The purpose of this'as-
sociation shall be to provide additional means
by which faculty and students may work to-
gether on common problems and, through these
joint activities, enrich further the collective life,
as Well as the life of the individual, at the Uni-
versity.”

Thus the SFA founding fathers wrote in 1934.
In "plain words this simply means, “Here, boys,
is an organization. Go out and ﬁnd something
for it to do.” ' — ‘

«Howanyone can deduce anything about pol-
icy--determining or any other characteristic of
student’ government out of this has us stumped.
In’ fact, we think, this is the exact opposite
method of approaching student government. In-
stead of saying what it can govern and cannot
govern, it says “Go out and ﬁnd new ﬁelds to
-govern.” I ‘

Themain problem with Pitt student activi-

ties is not thatlthere are too few of them. The
object for any governing group should not be
“‘to provide additional” ones. A student council
should be concerned with coordinating, integ-
rating, improving the ones already existing.

sponsibility for Women’s Self Governing asso-

H  Reports on Condition
Of ‘little Greemes’

"Last. fall we took it upon our socially conscious self

{to issue advice to the poor untrodden fre;;'mnen of the
«class of ’44 better known as the Little Green Unplucked.

/At this writing it pleases us to announce that they are
"well-plucked,
‘where you couldlay them on a grasgy bank, step back
“Lien feet, and be unable to see them.

and rapidly emerging from the state

"f\We can take no credit for the plucking, since we
“are nothing but a poor broken-down old hold-up man,
and no match for those people down in the Commons
Room. They get away with it right under the noses
of half a dozen cops.

However, we do claim that our advice is mainly
responsible for the comparative sophistication of the
second‘ semester froshies, and we therefore, ﬂushed with
success, will attempt to do as much for the incoming
crop. '

First, we suggest that you read over everything
printed" on the hand-full of assorted documents left
you‘ after registering. You will note the following
printed on the inside of the cover of your ticket book,
under ‘paragraph 3, “The proper coupon entitles the
owner to‘ a seat in the cheering section at football games,
and the further privilege of purchasing two reserved
football tickets for members of his immediate family
at --the established prices.” Note well the bold face
parts." Here the University extends an inestimable
privilege to its students, a privilege which should be
cherished and held dear the more especially because
the public, the canaille, are una.ble, however nouveau
riche, or vieux riclie even, to purchase it with their
ﬁlthy lucre, which has corrupted so many of our lead-
ing statesmen and educators.

Mark me well, the integrity of the Department of
Athletics is not to be questioned. It would be useless
for the innocent freshman to take up three established
prices and attempt to secure one over the limit on
tickets. Such a foul. aspersion on the honor of the
department is almost as bad as pronouncing the name
without the epenthesine second “a.” (I am indebted
to Dr. Jotham Johnson for that word.) It ranks as a
deadly sin. All such persons are hurled from the
highest battlement of the Stadium. and their remains
summarily expelled from these ivy halls. Don’t say
I didn’t warn you. You know how averse they are to
ﬁgeltting the stadium paid for.

Well, that’s about all we have to warn you about,
since we don’t want to repeat our column of last
semester. So now we’ll ﬁni--

Whoall Just one more thing, and a very important
one. Have your girl stitch this maxim on a sampler
and hang it up on your study wall. “Never give a
prof credit for any intelligence.” We’ve tried it and
it doesn’t work. You must explain everything to them
simply and fully, in words of one syllable, and if you
think I’m fooling just try assuming that your prof
hasthe intelligence and knowledge of a 3-year-old
some time and watch your grades take a dive.

« no ofiicial report.

forensic outﬁts, the honorary and professional
fraternities et al. could be a full—time end-object
for an all-University student governing group.

The utter anarchy and confusion concerning
what an organization can and cannot do could
be solved by a virile student government. The
headache of apportioning money to the various
groups might be relieved somewhat by some
central student—i'aculty authority. And so on.

>14 >!= =I~' *

The SFA constitution, then, equips us with no
authority to label Student—Faculty association
as an all-University student government. It
cannot be called a regulator or even moderator
of activities; for it is little more than just an-
other activity itself.

The constitutional revision committee will

have to make drastic fundamental changes, in
the present SFA constitution and secure the
cooperation of campus activities and the author-
ity from the Board of Trustees before any
semblance of real student government can be
recognized-

you choose to call SFA, what about the work
they do do? Does the present constitutional
framework provide for the most efficient con-
duct of their business?

After examining the record and witnessing
the functioning of this group for the past four
years, our answer is no, it does not.

The main defect is that there are too many
members in the group. There are too many
SFAers—-—student and faculty alike—-who do not
and cannot participate in the deliberations or
whatever else SFA does.

Anyone who has watched the organization
operate knows that nine people not only domi-
nate the assembly but virtually dictate what
goes and what does not This is the executive
committee—composed of the dean of men, the
dean of women, the assistant dean of men, and
six students. This condition results from (1)
powers allotted to the executive committee by
the constitution and (2) powers assumed by
them because of the bulkiness of the assembly.

It is the executive committee, not the assem-
bly that is given the power to charter student
organizations and to revoke them, to compile
social rules, to administer the cheering block, to
sponsor assemblies, to select dance chairmen.
The assembly fits into the picture only in that
they can over-rule the executive committee with
a two-thirds vote. This has never been done to
any degree of importance.

At the monthly meetings of the assembly it
is the executive committee members who sug-
gest and steer all matters of business. They
(and, in certain cases, the standing committee
chairmen) make all the speeches and do all the
explaining.

The assembly sits as a lackadaisical cheering
section, occasionally asks irrelevant questions,
and concerns itself mainly with forming quo-
rums. Its members are all big activities men
and women (activities big shots, to get elected
in the spring popularity contests) and ten from
the faculty appointed by the chancellor.

The activity leaders are too tied up as they
are with their own activities even if the con-
stitutional make-up permitted them much active
participation in SFA proceedings. The faculty
assembly members—God bless them--try awful-
ly hard to attend as many evening meetings as
they can spare, try to be interested in the pro‘-
ceedings, vote generally as a block and as the
executive committee goes.

So when you come right down to it, the as-
sembly isn’t much good at all. The only tangible
thing they do is rubber stamp the decisions of
the steering committee, and vote for those of-
ﬁcers picked. in advance by Interfraternity coun-
cil and independent leaders.

So why not abolish the assemblv? We. see
no reason for not doing so. You can’t justify its
existence by calling it a representative legisla-
ture of the students and faculty, because SFA
is no legislature. And since its just another
activity, the efﬁcient way of administering its
program is not with a cumbersome forty-man
committee.

The revision committee must be willing to
call a spade a spade, to look at SFA as it actually
opera.tes—not the way it is set up in fanciful
imagination.

We suggest that if SFA is to remain just an-
other activity they shou.ld streamline the ma-
chinery for more eﬁicient operation as an activ-
 not as a government group. ‘

If it’s government the committee.’s after. it
is their job to create a new organization for this.

Draft Set-up
May Change

The second national selective
service registration day «will proba-
bly be pushed ahead of the original
October date to April 1.

With conscription now estab-
lished for ﬁve years, consideration
is being given to plans for the
“automatic registration” of draft
eligibles upon reaching the age of
21. “In all probability,” states the
Intercollegiate Washington press,
“the second registration day an-
nouncement will be accompanied
by a ruling requiring, thereafter,
individual registration by young
men within ﬁve days after reaching
their twenty-ﬁrst birthday.”

The report further revealed that
there will. be a probable adoption
of a policy regarding college stu-
dents of draft age whovwill enroll
for the 1941-42 school year. The
adoption of such a measure will
remedy the uncertainty now pre-
vailing among students.

Another item in the letter "quoted
a report of the American Council
on Education as stating “The prob-
lem of occupational deferment.of
selected students and faculty mem-
bers will become increasingly acute

. the responsibility for request-
ing deferment of individual students
on an occupational basis to com-
plete professional training rests as
much on the institution as the in-
dividual.”

Nursing Schedule

During the second semester the
nursing suite of the Student Health
Service for Women will be open
from Monday to Thursday nights
inclusive from 6 to 10 o’clock with
Elizabeth Devitt, registered nurse,
in charge.

First aid in emergency accidents
or illness will be offered to both the
men and women in the evening
classes. The staff will be available
for nursing counsel when desired
for individual student health prob-
lems.

The suite is located on the twen-
ty-eighth floor of the Cathedral.
Express elevators stop on the twen-
ty-seventh door, but on special re-
quest elevators E and G will take
an emergency patient to the twenty-
cighth floor. Miss Devitt can also be
reached by telephone and will be
prepared to respond to any emer-
gency that prevents a patient’s go-
ing to the health oﬂices.

In addition to the services out-
lined above, the rest room on the
twenty-eiglith ﬂoor will be availa-
ble continuously from 8:30 o’clock
each morning until 9:45 o’clock
Monday through Thursday nights to
those University women desiring
relaxation during that time.

Chatter

44am it/is 

by Bill 1W0:-Elwaini
Sports Editor

 

Quite a bit of talk has been occasioned by the ‘pro football boys’
reaching into the college ranks and drawing out Notre Dame’s
Elmer Layden for the new position of high commissioner of the
National Professional League. There seem to be approximately
two schools of thought on the matter, one which condenis Layden
for leaving the saiictiﬁed atniosphere of higher education, the
other which lauds his move and sees in it the solution to all the
problems of the paid-to-play circuit.

As is usually the case, the proper attitude seems to lie some-
where in between the two extremes. Vtle can see nothing repre-
hensible in the act of Layden’s withdrawal from the college scene,
but we do not think that the former fullback in the Four Horse-
men backﬁeld can solve all the problems the professional game
presents.

Layden has done a great‘ deal to take Notre Dame out of the
class of a pure “football factory” and if he wishes to leave South
Bend, we should say his accomplishments there had justiﬁed his
doing whatever he cared to. He should be a credit to professional
football, but that he can immediately remove such obstacles as the
rival American League, over which he has no jurisdiction, we
seriously doubt. Perhaps some day the two leagues may operate
with as much harmony as do baseball’s major leagues under the
ﬁrm rule of Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Until Layden or
someone else is vested with authority over both leagues, such har-
mony is unlikely.

So far as we can see, there is only one real smudge on Laydeii’s
appointment and that is his consistent record of opposition to the
pro game. Laydon’s most illustrious predecessor into professional
circles was Dr. John Bain Sutherland, another opponent of the pro-

fessionals. Of course, it ’s probably just a caseof both men wanting,

to improve their positions. Laydei-1.~’s improvement amounted to a
$14,000 gain over his Notre Dame salary. But then, you can forget
an awful lot of principles for that much money.

Can’t Tech It, Eh?

VVe notice that Bill Floyd, sports editor of Carnegie Tech’s
Tartan, has come right out and hinted that the Tech basketball boys
aren’t trying, and that regardless of the cause, it‘ might not be
amiss for the Scotties to cancel the rest of their games for the sea-
son. In view of Carnegie ’s ten out of t.en losing streak this year,
the idea has merits.

Frankly though, we’re afraid friend Floyd has allowed his
feelings to run away from him. To accuse‘ a college athletic team
of not trying is a pretty discouraging indictment. No one wants
to win more than do the athletes participating in a game. Don’t
be so hard on them, Bill. Besides,,our spies tell us that had the
'l‘echs_been trying a.t top speed every minute of the way, such is the
material from which Max Hannuin must mold his quintet that the
season’s record would probably be just about the same.

And by the way, Bill (and President Doherty), what happened
to the Carnegie alumni who were going to supply athletes?

Not That It Matters

Swimmers Lose Three Meets
During Mid-Semester Vacation

While the student body of the
University was enjoying its usual
mid-year vacation, Pitt’s eager but
meager swimming squad fell victim
to a three-way thrashing adminis-
tered in single doses by Rider, Ken-
yon, and Ohio State.

Kenyon’s victory, 51-24, was the
only decisive defeat the Panthers
suffered. Iii losing the Rider meet,
40-35, and the Buckeye battle, 43-
32, Grady’ boys had at least a ﬁght-
ing chance to be victorious. Had
Pitt taken a ﬁrst place in the 440
yard free style event against Rid-er,
the Panthers would have had a one
point victory. In the Ohio State
meet, the Cathedral lads won each
of the last three events but still
couldn’t muster enough points for

But it seems that Grady has only
about a dozen swimmers to use in
the nine or ten events of each meet.
Of this number, there are only
eight veterans. So it’s impossible
in the later events of a meet for
Grady to call upon experienced men

who have not tired themselves in

previous battles. More swimming
prospects could easily clear this sit-
uation up.

The two remaining meets of the
season won’t be so tough as the pre-
vious ones for two reasons. Penn
State and Franklin and Marshall
aren’t.considered in the same com-
petitive class as Rider, Kenyon, or
Ohio State. And the Panther swim-
mers have shown deﬁnite improve--
ment with each succeeding meet.

Trackers Seek

NYAC Titles

For the third consecutive week
the traveling Pitt indoor trackers go
on the road, appearing this Satur-
day in Times Square’s famed Mad-
ison Square Garden for the New
York AC games.

Much of the attention paid to the
Pitt delegation will center on Bul-
let Bill Carter, the dusky sprint
star. Beaten by inches by Harold
Davis in the Millrose games, Carter
renews his rivalry this Saturday
night. Davis is favored, but Carter
will certainly give him a battle.

When Davis nipped Carter, many
of the fans booed the decision of
the judges, and in newsreels seen
afterwards, Carter seemed to hold a
slight advantage. At any rate. their
renewed Madison Square Garden
feud should provide plenty of ex-
citement.

Temporarily in the background
after Carter’s ﬁne showing, sprint-
ing twin Hap Stickel will also be in
the picture, and he has often beaten
Carter.

The Pitt mile relay team seeks
its ﬁrst win of the indoor campaign.
Placing third in the Millrose games,
and second in both the Seton Hall
and Boston AA games, the foursome
of Stickel, Regis Larkin, Del An-
derson, and captain Larry Tregon-
ing may receive a shakeup with vet-
eran Clyde Graf’s return to the
track after a siege of ﬂu.

carried them to easy wins at Duke
and Army, they should chalk up
another road triumph.

Best news coming out of‘ the
Panther’s vacation trips is the bril-

liant shooting record of Eddie
Straloski, who rolled up 26 points
in the two games. Press reports
had the Pitt team deadly in its
shooting and ﬂawless in its passing
and ﬂoor work. Press reports are
nearly always glowing. But Stro
isn’t, and the news that he has re-
gained his shooting eye should be
heartening to Pitt fans.

With George Kocheran playing
his best game of the season and
whipping 13 points through the
cords to pace the Panther attack,

Pitt passed circles around the Duke '

Blue Devils to the tune of 46-3'2.

Against Army’s rugged attack,
pre—defense boom variety, the Jun-
gle Cats got a stiffer wor.k—out, but
emerged with a 39-32 win behind
Straloski’s 16 points.

EDDIE STRALOS~.KI—-There is a
basketball theory wiiich hows that
the way to win games is to score
more points than your opponents.
Correlative to this theory is one
which maintains you must take
shots to make shots. Pd Straloski
is a proponent of both theories.

.Strol’s scoring successes have be-
come an old story to Pitt fans in

Memorial Chapel Donor,

Howard Heinz, Succumbs

Bowman, Weber Will Represent
University at Today’s Services

Funeral services for Howard Heinz, trustee of the University for
35 years and one of the donors of the Heinz Memorial chapel, will be
conducted at 3 o’clock this afternoon from the Shadyside Presbyterian

church.

Mr. Heinz died in Philadelphia Sunday night at the age of 63, and

the body was brought to Pittsburgh.

Chancellor John G. Bowman and
John Weber, secretary of the Uni-
versity, will represent the Univer-
sity at the services for the world
famous industrialist and Pittsburgh
civic leader.

“In the death of Howard Heinz,
Pittsburgh loses its foremost citi-
zen,” declared Dr. Bowman. “He
was a leading citizen in business,
considered even from a world point
of view. But he also gave freely
his time and energy toward a bet-
ter Pittsburgh.

“Few men, as I believe, anchored
their lives more solidly in eternal.
principles——-sincesity and kindness,
for example, coupled with the vision
and the sense to put these principles
into everyday "life.

“A native nobility governed his
decisions. The Heinz l\/Iemorial
chapel i.s one of the many charac-
teristic marks left here by his life.
Pittsburg.‘n will miss Howard Heinz.”
S Both Mr. Weber and Dr. Bow-
man emphasized that one of the
most remarkable qualities ,noticed
in working with Mr. Heinz was his
concernrfor minute details; but he
never lost the perspective of the
whole situation.

On November 18. 1938‘, Mr. Heinz
presented -the Heinz Memorial
chapel, “the fulﬁllment of a dream
to which we have devoted so many

years,” to the University.

 A r memorial to Henry John
Heinz. Mr. Heinz’s father, and Anna
Margarette Heinz, grandmother, the
chapel was dedicated to the stu-
dents of the University as a “sym-
bol of spiritual growth and of man’s
reach toward serenity . . a per-
manent expression of the beauty of
Christianity.”

The chapel. was opened to the
public Monday, November 28, 1938,
“a place for the individual to medi-
tate and worship as he wishes” and
not dedicated to any one creed.

Mr. Heinz presented gold and
silver keys to the Heinz chapel
choir on the Sunday prior to the
Christmas recess in the Commons
room—the last time he was in the

University.
TA member of the Board of
Trustees since 1906, Mr. Heinz

served on the faculty-curriculum
and the ﬁnance committees of the
Board.

He was born in Sharpsburg in
1877 and received his early educa-
tion at the Shadyside Academy, and
in 1900 graduated from Yale.

Immediately after leaving Yale
he entered the H. J. Heinz com-
pany, founded by his father in 1869,
and, after the death of his father
in 1919, he became president of the
organization, which has expanded
to England, Australia, Canada, and
Spain. 1
