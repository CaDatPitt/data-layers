Students, Faculty Rally

Mass Meeting Probes Financial, Crisis_

_ by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

Commonly united . to provide
possible solutions to the stalemate
in the. State Legislature which is
blocking the University"s appro-
priation and putting its future into
question. one Chancellor. four stu-
dents and ‘a union organizer ad-
dressed an audience that over-
flowed the capacity of CF 120-1 at
a Wednesday noon rally.

University Chancellor Dr. Wes-

ley W. Posvar defined the political.
- impasse in terms of a balance of

power conflict “between the two

houses andthe Governor." Dr.
Posvar rejected the "myth" that
the problem can be solved by a
massive increase in tuition since
it would deny an education to the
majority of University students
who come from “modest income"
backgrounds. "

Although he pledged himself to

preserving the state-related stat-_-

us of the school. the Chanc_ellor re-

vealed that the University is near- 

ing the end of its borrowing power.
While the University will accom-

modate students registered for

Spring session. the 35-40 million

dollar debt already incurred may

force closure after that time.
Three Proposals-
Encouraging students and fac-
ulty' to continue letter-writing
ca‘mpaigns_.which he claimed are

“beginning to pay off." the Chan-

cellor proposed a three point pro-

gram to increase efforts:

Action Council. composed of
student leaders and politically-
experienced faculty members

Nader Leads Attack On

  "Instituti0mtl Violence”  

by POHLA SMITH
Staff Writer

Ralph Nader’, nationally
known consumer crusader, ad-
dressed a standinglroom only
crowd in the Student Union
Ballroom on the topic “Corpor-
ate Responsibility and Co-
sumer Protection,” Tuesday
at noon.

Though.he humorously de-

manded “Who’s in charge of 1

this, technology?” when the
microphone malfunctioned,
Nader soon showed that other
abuses suffered by consumers

are no laughing matter, and ‘

that they are, instead, prob-

lems caused largely by irre-.

sponsible corporations.

Nader went on to say that con-
sumers are being hurt in two
ways: individually by bad prod-
ucts such as lead poisoned paint
and en masse by industrially caus-
ed air. soil. and water pollution.

Nader explained that corpora-
tions have set up a massive de-
fense system of 10,000 lawyers

‘who can override the small noise

made‘ by the eight lawyers who
represent the publid’s “paper
rights,” contracts, guarantees,

etc., through governmental reg- .

ulating agencies. Consumers just
are not fairly represented by our
legal system: “a searching eval
uation of the reality of our legal
system . . . is grim indeed,” com-

'mented Nader.

Nader accused corporations

;and bureaucracies of an “institu-
. tional violence“ worse than the

violence in our streets. Pointing
ou-t such violent ‘situations caus-
ed. by institutional irresponsibil-
ity he said that each year more
people are victims of accidental
electrocution in hospitals than
homicide. Non-enforcement
of housing laws causes countless

‘ black children to be poisoned, by

the critical factor in the second
line of defense. Nader said that
even _though Hippocrates proved
2.000 years ago thata human body
is. more lenient_ when -it comes up

against a flat surface. rather than ,7

pointed: it took thetauto industry
until .1067 to replace the resilient
steering (column that‘ had impaled

25.000’victi-ms since .-1900 withsa -

collapsiblefcolumn.

Nader vcontinued to say that a‘
lack of _ mass perception : about
Droducts isa big problem and) that

producers s‘yste'maticallyv lie-

about their products and get away",
with it. As‘ a law student‘Nader

wrote and asked ,‘why cars had,

fins. The auto industry replied-
that they performed “aerodyna-
mic functions.” Because fins no

, longer appear on cars, Nader won-

ders if the “winds have changed.”

Attacking food and drug indus-

.‘ tries. Nader said_ that producers

tend to make and sell products and

_s then test them later. Many chemi-

Nader _said-' food processing
plants are also at fault. "Many
plants simply are not clean,»'. there
are often rodents and vermin in
the factories and the products."
he said. ‘i

Nader explained that the Food
and Drug Administration simply
does not have the funds-to test and
regulate products as it should.
“Why,” Nader, wants to know,
“do we spend ten times more on
one submarine than on food safe-
ty and one-half as much on the
safety’ of migratory birds. The
only alternative,’-’ ..Nader added

- with a grim humor, “is to show
all these. things are due to a Com-
munist plot.”

Speaking of the ways consum-
ers are legally cheated; Nader
said. "The average bank robber
would drool for such a legal set-
up.“ He stated that one—third of
the car owners who arecharged
for repairs have not_ hadtheir cars
,_ worked on. Food producers do not
“put the" percentage of ingredients
on their lables: many citrus juices
are ten to_ 15 per cent water. hot
dogs are one-third fat plus another
large percentageof bindings. gris-

tle. et_c. Nader said if a consumer,
knew what went into a hot dog .“he‘

would have to be a masochist to
' eat one."

Speaking ‘on what would happen

if existing. consumer laws were’

"enfo‘rced...'Nader‘ said.’ "I don't

. think business can, tolerate law
enforcement. If we wanted_ to en-
force these laws we would endjup
with massive prosecutions‘. ‘mas-
sive jails. and massive change. "

Nadersaid‘ one answer to com I
sumer problems is buyer ‘know-. _'

ledge. A buyer should demand a‘
knowledge of the product. “When
a car salesman tells you a car can

go from 0 to 60 mph‘in' four sec-v
it can go .-

onds, ask him how‘ fast
from 60 to 0.” .

Nader expressed the great need V
for young people to go;into cone.

"The crux of the Democratic-

crats for the budget allocations to

P . .

‘Rich Republicans’

As such. they_will not support
an income tax in the Senate for
fear that the majority Democrats
in the House will tack on a $1500
deduction which would levy taxes
on 75 per cent of the population.
"Eighty-five ‘per cent of these are
rich Republicans,"C said Baum.

"and the legislature will not tax -

rich Republicans." ’
On the other hand. Democrats

Leader., and Herbert 'Fineman. '

Speaker of the House. refuse to re-
lease the state universities‘ allo-
cation bill from committee until
"there is a wide enough tax base

to pay for all the programsin the,
_ budget."

Baum revealed that a four
School conference he attended last
week in Philadelphia took the

‘same position. "that until the hos-

pitals. juvenile rehabilitation
homes. and other social service
operations are -funded 100 per cent,‘
the - universities should not be
funded 100 per cent.“ '

‘An alternative proposal under
consideration. would be passage

of a bill providing 50 per cent of .

mediately .and then. next 'year.«

Letters To State Urged

Two prominent State Legisla-
tors suggested what they consi-
der the_ most effective methods
students can use to help the Legis-
lature forumulate a tax package
that would enable the passage of
the Universitys long overdue ap-
propriation.

State Senator Ernest Kline.
Beaver Falls Democrat. suggest-
ed that students verbally convince
members_of their local commun-
ities that investment in higher ed-
ucation is a good investment.

"Students can help us by con-
vincing their parents. teachers.
and even aunts and uncles to write

letters to their legislators sup-

porting financial appropriations
to higher education.“ Senator
Kline stated. "More people have
got to come to understand that
where we have strong educational
facilities. we have strong econom-
ic areas." 4

Senator Kline added that letters
should not be written in a threat-
ening or intimidating manner if
you intend to favorably influence
your legislator.

cept his nomination in mute
passivity.

Harris Miller, in a sense-
the defeated candidate, ac-.

cepted the legitimacy of the
committee with the greatest
reluctance. “I was well
aware,” noted Miller,” that
we would be removing the
election from the domain of
the students. Cundra and
(John) Cavaluchy, however,
threatened to take the whole
thing to civil court and I
was damned if I was going
to let that happen. I ‘wanted
to preserve some amount of
decorum in SG. ”

That _last modicum of de-
corum disappeared with the
inconsistent logic of the fac-
ulty committee. The com-
mittee aimed both barrels of
its attack at the, Student
Government Elections Com-
mittee (SGEC). saying that

some distant goal which will
mean HAPPINESS. SUCCESS.
SATISFACTION: the culmina-
tion of all of one's hopes. ex-
pectations and dreams. Why
should this old man who has
probably experienced this or-
deal wish to be young again?

In fact. the mere thought of
his wishing to be young might
be looked upon as- the supreme
irony. Just think of all, the in-
numerable obstacles and frus-
trations that are encountered as
a result of youth. I know that

very often I have perceived my,

youth as a distinct disadvan-
tage; something which stands
in the way of achieving the
goals and desires I have set my
sight on, something which must
be overcome. And I'm sure
the old man experienced the
same restlessness at some time.
So why would he want to re-
live that period oflife?

The question keeps reverber-
ating within my head. Why?
Why? Why‘? Why? There must
be some answer. I am puzzled.
and I am searching for an ans-

while. Perhaps

the SGEC had overstepped
its authority in disqualifying
Cundra.

In a statement on_ Mon-
day’s Pitt News the com-
mittee explained its findings
in an argument that runs
something like this: 1) Cun-
dra’s disqualification was
based on his violation of
“special rule number ‘three: ”
2) “rule number three, as a
special rule, does not exist
in the SG Elections Code;
3) the SGEC may only exer-
cise authority expressly
granted it by the Elections
Code; 4) the SGEC hadn’t
the authority to censure Cun-
dra for breaking an il1igiti-
mate rule. The SGEC there-
fore, had no grounds on
which to disqualify Cundra.

Yet the committee over-
looked or ignored the actions

  School Daze

by RICHARD J. PALAZZI

,Watching the kids in Chicago's Black ghettos going to school ‘

makes me want to throw up. Most of the casework I did was with
kids; I had a lot of contact with the schools and teachers. and I tutor-
ed many of them. When I had a case where turancy was a major fam-
ily problem (as I frequently did), it was my job to make sure those
kids got to school every day. And I always felt like a hypocrite for it.

Everyone at all connected with the schools is to blame, I think.
The problems are too diverse to blame them all on one person or
group. And the problems begin at home. The ghetto home is fre-
quently like a small circus. There are a lot of children, the condi-
tions are crowded, and, by the time a child is old enough to go to
school. he is seldom the well-mannered, easily authoriated child that
our local elementary schools get in first grade. S0,. in order tohold
the attention of a previously-untamed class of six-year-olds, the
teacher must be a dynamic, fascinating person who can captivate

' his audience. and sneak knowledge into them, Few teachers are this
good'—and those who face another problem, the administration.

Qur school administrations in suburbia are encouraging young,

. -energetic teachers to try all the experimental teaching methods they
learned in college. in hopes of teaching our children better and fas-

_ ter. Not so in the ghetto. Elementary school principals there are
just like the ones you and'I had when were small. They are frequent-
ly 66-year-old women. who get extremely disturbed if their routine

is disturbed. Anything out of the ordinary is frowned upon. Experi-

mentationis not encouraged.

TEACHERS DON’T have much to work with in the way of text-'
books. either. In Chicago. each school may order a new set of text-
books for one subject (e.g. math.language. arts, social studies) each
year. This means that a school may buy this year, all of the ad-

vanced. modern. experimental readin

books it needs. Except for

one problem. The Board of Education is extremely conservative and
antiquated in its selection of permissible materials. So if it doesn‘t
approve of a series. that is, presently considered excellent, the
school can't buy that reading series for another five years, when it
may be outmodedfby an even better, but unapproved series. Ghetto
teaching methods are..therefore. five to ten years behind those our

. children enjoy.

City schools are only permitted to fail a certain small» percen-
tage of their enrollment per year. But. because of the conditions I
’ have explained, the percentage of those who haven't performed up to
passing level is higher than it is allowed to be, so the schools "pass
most of them anyhow. A sterling example of the results of thisr"so-
_g cial promotion" system is a ten-year-old boy I met who is in fifth
' grade. He has never failed a year. But itis fact that he hasn't attend- 4
ed a hundred days of school in his life, and doesn't even have the"
readingjlevel of a first grader. He may just make it all the way
through high school and receive a diploma, never having learned any- .
thing. And, indeed. far too many students are graduating from ghet-
to high schools with an eighth grade performance level. I

I CAN understand now why some people believe that "the sys-
tem". operates to keep black people uneducated and in the ghetto.

More on the schools in my next article. j

RSU Answers Letter

Editor. The Pitt News:

In the February 4. 1970 issue
of The Pitt News, five General
Studies students claiming to be
employees of General Electric.
presented a critique of the Rev-
olutionary Socialist Union's col-
umn dealing with the GE strike.
While accusing Ann Miller. the
author. ‘of being "grossly inac-
curate.“ they offered The Pitt
News readers a number of ques-
tionable "corrections" to which
we'd like to address ourselves.

First of all. it should be point-
ed out that we are now discuss-

ing past history. The workers.

have won their strike -— not a
perfect settlement, but certainly
an advance from the take-it-or-
leave-it policy which GE has tra-
ditionally used against the un-
ions.

Secondly. it is clear that the
five critics felt more sympathy
for GE than for the strikers. We
suspect that they’re neither un-
ion members nor factory work-
ers; honesty should have com-
pelled them to make clear their
positions at GE.

The first criticism they make

is that the $3.95 figure used by‘

Ann Miller represents not the
dividend per share of GE stock.
but only the net earning per
stock. This is hardly the cor-
rection‘ of a "gross inaccuracy."
but it is one (in fact the only
onei which we are able to ac-
cept.

The second criticism is that.
contrary to Ann Miller‘s asser-
tion, GE "has nothing-to do"
with the splitting of a once-unit-
ed union in the electrical indus-
try (UE) into two competing and
antagonistic unions (UE and
IUE). This is simply untrue. In
an atmosphere of intensifying
Cold War hysteria, which has
later _to be labled “McCarthy-
ism," UE was split. (An inter-
esting and recent study of this
phenomenon can be found in
James R. Prickett, “Some As.-
pects of the Communist Contro-
versy in the CIO,“ Science &
Society, Summer—Fa1l, 1969.I It
is one of the achievements of
the workers that they overcame
this old division to the extent‘
of winning important gains in

' the recent strike._

Thirdly. the critics "accuse"
Ann Miller of pointing to the
reality of inflation: they then
talk about GE's wonderful offer
to pay enough to meet the ris-
ing cost of living. Rather than
pointing up an "inaccuracy."
they are slipping in a sales pitch
for GE's old wage offer. Ap-
parently they‘re shocked that the
workers were ungrateful en-
ough to find it inadequate.

In the course of their fourth
criticism, they cite Ann Millers
description of "Boulwarism“
(take-it—or-leave-it bargaining I
and then assert that GE had the
graciousness, this time. to
change its original offer to the
unions. Despite’ the fact that
they take note of (and do not
refute) accusations that. GE‘s
new offer was stingier than the
original. they insist that the un-
ions’ rejection of this insult

"proves" that “Boulwarism" was A

never a, real issue. Wehave dif-
ficulty in accepting such logic.

Needless to say. the striking
workers finally persuaded GE
to bargain seriously and honest-

The final criticism takes our
columnist to task for advocating
a boycott of GE products. This
would.

ing injury." They fail to note.
however. that GE workers them-
selves advocated a boycott.

In conjunction with Women's
Housing Board and Men's Dor-
mitory Council. -the University
Housing Office‘ is implement-
ing a Coeducational. Residence
Hall Project to begin‘ in the fall
of 1970. We feel this will pro-
vide a more relaxed and natu-
ral environment where students
will-get a more complete under-
standing of the opposite sex. We
hope_that proximity of men and
womengin a residence hall will
sincere
meaningful relationships.‘ while
still encouraging academic ex-
cellence, V

McCormick. which houses‘ 165
students. has been chosen for the

. project-.- Three to- ten students

and‘

own kitchen and private bath.
There is a lounge for every two
floors. We strongly urge inter-
ested persons to visit McCormick
Hall to investigate the suite ar-
rangement. SPECIAL OPEN

3:00.

ing relocatesl who will be- a so-
phomore. junior. or senior in

host Lynn Hinds had his talk
show “Controversy” expanded
into the all-night show. "Coun-
terpoint." According to Miss
Smith. Hinds felt that the ex-

panded show required a co-host. .

When asked who was the most
interesting person that she had
met through the show, she re-
plied that the-people who call
in are the most interesting. Lis-
tening to the real people,” she
said,

“makes you come down-

from the ivory tower of the aca-
demic world.”

In order to answer the wide
variety of questions of the lis-
teners. Miss Smith finds it ne-

cessary to keep abreast of the
-current events. She does this by
.spending her Sundays reading

such newspapers‘ as i the New
York‘Times and the Washing-
ton Post. She also reads such
periodicals as Newsweek, Time,

I Harpers, and Atlantic Monthly.

‘Miss. Smith said she can see.
Mr. - Nixon's problem in‘ getting

out of Vietnam. but personally

favors withdrawal. "The. United
States has too long acted as the
moral policeman‘ of the ,world.‘.‘

Speaking of films. she said
she thought the year's.best mov-

, ies were Midnight Cowboy, Easy

Rider, and The Sterile Cockoo.
She thought they were good be-
cause "anyone of any back-
ground or any, bias can find an

interpretation to suit them."

Along with her broadcasting
Miss Smith has also co-authored
an article with Mr. Hinds on an
analysis of President Nixon’s
rhetoric which will appear in
the periodical Nation very soon.

‘Miss Smith received her B.A.
in philosophy at George Wash-

.ington University in Washington.

D.C. She gained her interest in
rhetoric and public address by

A participating on .George Wash-

ington‘s°de'bate team. She chose
the University of Pittsburgh for
her graduate studies because it

-‘has ‘a ‘unique program in its

speech department. one that is a

study of deliberation and deci-_

sion-making on public issues:
i.e.. how decisions are made in
the United States.

Here on campus Miss Smith

is very busy as associate direc-
tor of the William Pitt ‘Debate

. Union.

‘plethora of examples of “slide-

fender" who successfully de-
fends the American, consum-

‘mer. Everything from Volkswa-

gons. a Japanese Lantern - it
crumbles to hot ‘dogs, has receiv-
ed. his attention. '

For Nader, working under the
Nixon administration ’"is "much
more difficult" than ‘the John-
son administration.—“It‘s a big
business administration all:-the
way." A critic of Supreme Court

nominee Judge Carswell. Nader"
also criticezed the Department_
of Labor as being '_'irresponsi—»

aged the late Yablonski to run

Naderlooks forward to a cabi-

net post that is "an internal of- '
fice of consumer advocacy and‘
-wi_ll represent that interest b’e- '

But Nader sees a correspond-
ing:.need for "professionals in-
dependently. working on govern-
ment and business. We must en'-
courage more’ people to go into

government agen-

   

 

politics’ on national; state. city ’

and local levels."

Advocating educational

.law schools, to “deal with con,-

As far as college students, we

should “integrate a consumer

For example, students in an eco-

Especially addressing law stu-
dents who crowded the rap ses-
sion, Nader noted "that the bas-
ic fallacy of legal education is
that it deals with appellate cas-
es. We‘re preparing lawyers for
the rest of the century on the
basis of a setup where there is
no access to the legal system
if you don't have thousands of
dollars."

Terming the Chicago Seven
Trial a case where the judge

"uses the integrity of the court- *

rooms a personal t'i'gleaf," Nad-
er criticized the “straight jacket
knowledge" that helps lawyers
pass the Bar Examination. "Give

In his Thoughts on Playwrit-
ing, Thornton Wilder listed “four
fundamental conditions of the
drama" that distinguish it from
the other arts: that the theatre
performance requires many col-
laborators; that it is “addressed
to the group mind"; that it is
"based upon a pretense and its
very nature calls out a multipli-
cation of pretenses"; and‘ that
the “action takes place in a per-
petual present." » 5

Theatre, as a form of com-
munication of man with man,

A Grapplers Set For Final Home Match

BOB KUHN, iunior 167 pounder, goes for his tenth win of the season tomorrow against Syracuse's Glen Bateman

or Rick Braetorius. Kuhn is having his best year for the matmen, losing only to Lehigh’s Jack Bent: and Temple's ﬂ

Wally Strosser.

ANALYSIS
By MARTHA HARTLE

The matmen go for their tenth
win of the season tomorrow at
2 p.m. in the Field House
against Syracuse. The match is
the last home appearance for the
grapplers and here‘s how we see
it:

118

Greg Mickinac has a couple of
big wins behind him, including
the Lehigh match and he should
get the grapplers off on the
right foot against Jim Snyder
tomorrow. Pitt, 3-0.

126
Either Steve Stahl or Bob Pin-

kos will get the call for the mat— '

men and neither have had much
varsity experience. Syracuse.
however, is weak in the lower
weight classes and the contest
is too close to call: a draw.
PITT, 5-2.
134

Dave Wylie has developed

into a consistent winner at 134-

and has been improving from

week to week. Look for _Wylie to
get _five on a fall. PITT, 10-2.

142

Mark Payne is still doubtful
due to a hand injury and if he
doesn't wrestle, Pat Lavery and
Bud Morris will both move down
a class. But either Payne or Lav-
ery should have little trouble
winning here. PITT, 13-2.

150

It will be either Lavery or
Morris against Syracuse's Jim
Schenk or Ray Boland. Boland
has lost only to Penn States
Clyde Frantz. but a good effort
by either of the Panthers should
result, in a decision. PITT, 16-2.

158

If Payne doesn’t wrestle at
142, sophomore Jim Fleming
will, get the call against Tony
Losito. Losito is having a medi-
ocre season and Fleming should
decision him. PITT, 19-2.

167

Bobby Kuhn has lost only
twice all season long and his

_ PITT, 22-2

other victory tomorrow. Glen
Bateman. a New York state
champ. will give Bobby a real
tough match if he wrestles. but
Bateman has been injured.

177

‘Here's where the going gets
tough. Vince Paolano is rated
as the East‘s best at 177 and will
remain undefeated. PITT, 22-5.

190

Paul Allen has been having a
good year, but Bob Rust will be
too tough. Rust is undefeated
so far and is an Eastern runner-
up. PITT, 22-8. v

- UNL.

The final match will pit two
heavyweights of equal size and
the match should be a close one.
Syracuse‘s_ Dennis Coupe is a
former Ohio State champ and
has-lost only two matches all
year. Too close to call, a draw.
PITT, 24-7.

That's win number ten. Now,
if it only happens tomorrow.

Matmen Vary Strategy

For Syracuse ,Match

. By MIKE MILLEN

....For the last several wrestling matches the grapplers have
‘been relying on their heavy weights to pull them through,
but tomorrow, in the final home match of the season, a diff-
erent strategy will be needed against the Orange of Syracuse.

"They are very strong in the upper weights." said Coach Dave

Adams. commenting on the Syracuse squad.

have been pulling us through
lately but now we're going to
have to rely on the lower
weights to get us off on the
right foot. Our big kids will hit
their toughest matches of the
yearf'

In their heavy weight line-up '

the Orangemen boast Vince Po-
alano at 177, who Adams consid-
ers." The best in the East at
'77." Paolano is undefeated so
far.

At 190 pounds is Bob Rust,
who is second in the East at
that weight. Adams says, “He
is extremely strong and he has
to be one of the better ones in
the East.”

Dennis Coupe wrestles at

Looks to Lightweights

Syracuse has lost- to Army,
Navy and Penn State“, but they
defeated Cornell by the narrow
margin of two'points. The Pan-
thers also beat Cornell by a
slim four point advantage.

The grapplers were behind in
the Cornell match\until the 190

"The fact that they beat Cor-
nell by nearly the same score
as we did could make it in in-

Hoopsters Aim  For Penn St. Sweep

By BILL NAAB

When the Panthers arrive
at Penn State for tomorrow
afternoon’s game, they will

' come face to face with fiery re-

-venge.

The Nittany Lions are quite
bitter about their previous loss
to the Panthers at the Field
House on January 17. 61-47. Pre-
ceding that torturous adventure.
the Lions hadn’t permitted the
humble Panthers to so much as
get within clawing distance dur-
ing the last five years.

Penn State had battered their
helpless foes eleven consecutive
times until Coach Buzz Ridl‘s Cat

sprang out of their perennial in-.

derdog role and into the unfami-
, liar position of coﬂiuerer.

It isn’t likely, however, that

Penn State might demonstrate

the same rock-em-sock ’em war-
“ fare that Carnegie-Mellon and
Syracuse utilized when confront- _;

ing the Panthers. If Penn State
is enraged, the squad will pro-
bably display their aggressive-
ness via smooth, co-ordinated
movements.

"We have madea commitment
to‘ speed and agility with this
team. We hope it can counteract
the lack of muscle and back-

board play. We can't play the
physical game we played last
year. Well have to do it with
finesse." Lion coach John Bach
stated.

No one, though actually ex-
pects Penn State to be totally
inept when it comes to the mus-
cle action under the boards.
Bach will start 6'8" 215 pound

Phil Nicholos at center. Bob
Fittin. a 6‘8” sophomore. and
Willie Bryant. a 6'3“ leaping

jackrabbit, at forwards.

The big man of the trio, Nich-
ols, never played high school
basketball and prior to the cur-
rent season had scored only 13
points in 20 games at Penn State.

Despite his physical promin-
ence. Nichols hasn't led the Lions
in rebounding in a single contest

According to the Nittany Lion
publicity department, it is-not the

in John Bach's eye. It is, however,

Cagers Get First
Road Win At B W

By BILL NAAB
The Panthers didn’t break another scoring record in

Wednesday night’s 73-64 victory at Baldwin-Wallace,

they did achieve another first.

but

Coach Buzz Ridls cagers recent nine-point triumph represented
their first road win of the year. In fact. l[ was the first Panther win

on a visiting court in two years.

Even though publicity direc-
tor Dean Billick didn‘t believe
that Baldwin-Wallace was even
in the same class asthe cagers.
Ridl stated that the slim vic-
tory wasn‘t a disappointment.

“It wasn’t as easy as we
thought it might’ve been, but it
was our first win on the road. I
can’t say I’m disappointed,” said

Ridl.

After Baldwin-Wallace edged
ahead of the cagers (7-6: in the
initial few minutes. Ridl's squad
spurted to a twenty point lead
and appeared to be rolling into
a lopsided triumph.

The Baldwin-Wallace Yellow
Jackets. however. took advantage
of several Panther turnovers
and closed the gap to ten at 36-
26. Then. Ridl inserted several
of his regulars in an attempt to
regain their momentum.$a

“Our substitutes had some
things happen. They didn’t pull
us. up. I would’ve liked to have
seen them give us a big surge;
it would’ve been good _for the
team,” Ridl remarked.

By halftime. the hoopsters
held a 40-28 advantage. In the
second half. the cagers couldn‘t
really get going. With just five
minutes left on the clock. the
Yellow Jackets chilled Panther
hopes of a slaughter.

Baldwin-Wallace chopped the
cager lead to three. 57-54. Kent‘
Scott‘s fielder and Mike Paul's
two buckets put the hoopsters

‘back on the right track. though.

“We missed a lot of one-and-

farone free throws in the last five

‘/

ls

minutes. We could have pulled
away with some good foul shoot-
ing,” Ridl explained.

For the first time in twelve
contests. Kent Scott failed to
pace the Panther scoring. Scott
hit on 7 of 16 attempts includ-
ing a few layups.

CUBS EDGED BY RM
Tim Grgurich’s Cubs -storm-.
ed ahead of Robert Morris, one
of the country’s best junior col-
lege teams, last night, but suc-
comed to a sparkling stretch
comeback by the Colonials. RM

finally won the game, 65-61.

The Cubs had a 39-25 halftime
lead and had the margin up to
17 points at one time, but cold
shooting and key victims of the
personal fouls meant the dif-
ference.

Cub Center Bill Sulkowski
fouled out of the game with
12:18 remaining and Buzzy
Harrisonfouled out with 8:38
left.

Carl Morris also fell victim
to his fifth personal with 1:52
left.

Marv Abrams led the Cub
scoring with 21 points; Harri-
son had l4, and Morris had 12.
Jim Dashield paced ail scorers

with 23 for Robert Morris. ' ‘

 

“Scott played fairly well. bu-t
his jump shot wasn't as sharp
as it had been.“ Ridl said.
“Mike Paul (21 pts.i‘ got some
good baskets when we needed it.
He helped pull us through."

Invitational tomorrow in Madison
Square Garden.

The Olympic Invitational will
feature the best trackmen in the
country and they‘ll be competing
at Olympic distances.

Bryant Salter. Smittie Brown,
Jerry Richey and the mile relay
team have all been invited to com-
pete for Pitt and according to
coach Jim Banner, “We have a
good shot in all the events. We’ll
be looking for victories and good
times."

Richey is the lone Pitt returnee
in the Olympic Invitational and
once again he’ll be entered in the
1500 meters. Last year, Richey
placed fourth in the race, as Vill-
anova’s Marty Liquori walked off
with top honors. Banner hasn’t re-
ceived any definite list of entries
for the meet, but he expects Li-
quori to be there again.

High jumper Bryant Salter was

Tuesday night. only to have the
bar tipped on the way down. In the
Garden. Salter will again be fac-
ing a field which includes a num-
ber of seven foot jumpers and pos-
sibly the Olympic and world rec-
ord holder Dick Fosbury. Salter‘s
best jump has been 610", but
Banner expects him to clear seven
feet this season.

Smittie Brown will be running
in the 500 meters and there's a
good possibility that he may be
running against Larry James. Lee
Evans or Martin McGrady. "He
won't know for sure who he'll be
up against till'we get there," ex-
plained Banner.

“Smittie doesn't have the big
names in the East yet, but we feel
he’s one of the best,” added Ban-
ner.

The mile relay team will be in
a heat featuring Manhattan Col-
lege, Rutgers and a Puerto Rican

team t'rom Mayaguez. The thin-

clad mile quartet lost to Rutgers
by three-tenths of a second in the
Baltimore Invitational two weeks
ago in a very close race. And Ban-
ner also confirmed that the Puer-
to Rican team has a "couple of
very fine runners."

One change in the mile relay
line-up this week finds John Aiken
replacing Dennis Schatzman.
Schatzman has been bothered by
a bad ankle. Aiken holds the varsi-
ty records in the 1000 yard run, but
according to Banner he should do
a good job in this shorter distance
as well.

The thinclads who won't be com-
peting in Madison Square Garden
will compete in a triangular meet
in the Field House beginning at
9:30 a.m. tomorrow. Edinboro
and Indiana University of Penn-
sylvania will be the opposition.
Banner has no specific informa-
tion on either team. but he feels
that Edinboro will be the stronger
of the two.

Tankers Host Orange

by JERRY MYERS

Seeking to avenge last year’s
70-43 thrashing, the mermen
battle the Syracuse Orange-
men tomorrow in.a 2 p.m. meet at
Trees Pool.

Pitting their 3-4 record against
-the-strength of the Orangemen.
the mermen will have to do some
tough swimming to win the meet.
Syracuse comes into Pittsburgh
with ‘victories over teams like
Cornell. Penn State and Bucknell
under their belts. Bucknell really
gave the tankers a rough time in
their maiden meet of the season
which the Panthers dropped. 65-
48.

_ According to_Coach Grant:
"Theyre tough. We'll have a
rough time in the freestyle events.
They come here with nine men

who they can shift around in the V

freestyle races."

Last year, things seemed a lot
more dismal as the tankers. were
only able to take four of the 13
events. The most significant part-

of that loss was the fact that Dave‘

Wessel, according to ' Coach
Grant, “Lost both the one and
three meter diving events to a boy
by the name of Skuse. Skuse will
be back-this year but “his scores
don’t come close to Dave’s.” '

Syracuse regards Pittsburgh
as a kind of jinx city. Very few
Pitt fans have forgotten the 22-21

‘win that the Panthers scored in

football. and then just lastweek
the Panthers topped -the Orange-
men in basketball in the third high-
est scoring game in, the college
ranks this season. It‘s now up to
the mermen to keep the win streak
alive. — . P -

According to‘ Grant the meet"

should go down to the wire. The
outcome will depend on how well

"0bjects” Flying At Trees Gym

Signal Approach Of Mitt Season

by ED CONLEY
Associate Sports Editor
Visitors to the Trees Hall Gym have to be aware of danger-
ous flying objects between the hours of 4 and 5:30 p.m. on week-

day afternoons.

Fifty—seven Pitt students are in the gym daily attempting to win
spots on the 1970 Panther baseball team and head coach Bobby Lewis
actually has them throwing baseballs in the confined area.

“We hit ground balls and our pitchers throw a bit to get their arms

in shape." Lewis said. “And we
try to set up situations—the relay.
the rundown—-so that the players
know where they should be when
they get outside.‘ This is all on a
miniature scale, of course."

Everything that the hopefuls
are doing indoors doesn’t involve
the real baseball that could hurt
an onlooker.

"Conditioning and exercise and
drills.“ Lewis says. “And we hit
wiffle_ balls to sharpen the eyes
before we get out into the batting
cage.

Lewis will have to slice the ros-
ter quite a bit before the team is
able to-swing from the cage. The
57 trying out are far too many to

.)*

be judging just a week or two
prior to the beginning of the sea-
son.

“This is definitely a problem in
college baseball,” Lewis assert-
ed. “Trying to evaluate ability in
the gym. But we have to—we

‘won’t get outside until near the

end of March, if we’re lucky.”

When the mitters luck moves
them outdoors they will have a

brand new field waiting for their
use. The All—Purpose fields. which
include a baseball diamond. were
complete during the summer and
the mitt edition of the Panther fin-
ally will have a home of its own
when the season begins April 4.

The squad was promised the
field last year. but construction-
al delays and bad weather pre-
vented its completion. forcing
them to play their games at Leech
Farm Field in East Liberty.

“We’ll be glad to have a home
field,” Lewis said. “We’ve never
had one. It just doesn’t feel like
you’re playing at home when you
get into a car and drive to the
field.”

Theres another change for Le-
wis and his mitt squad this sea-
son. The schedule has been ex-

panded. allowing a better oppor-
tunity to play the game.

Rain has practically cut the
number of encounters in half dur-
ing the last few seasons. Last
spring the mitters played only 13
games. Nine were rained out. ‘

And when a college baseball
game is canceled because of incle-
ment weather it is almost impos-
sible to re-schedule it because of
prior commitments, traveling
plans and academic provisions.

The new schedule lists
games. That's 33 chances for the
weather man to spoil the day for
the mitters. right‘?

    

 

BOBBY LEW
* Prepares Mitters

Well. not really, There are 12
doubleheaders planned. so there
will only be 21 days of action.

That means. however. that if all
12 twin bills are canceled because
of the weather, Lewis squad will
still play only nine games.
