Former professor uses knowledge

of smallpox to ﬁght bioterrorism

by Brandon Ellis
Staﬂ Writer

In October 1966, Pitt professor
of medicine and public health D.A.
Henderson arrived in Geneva as a
general ready for battle against one
of the deadliest foes of the 20th
century.

Smallpox had killed an estimated
300 million people worldwide since

1900, compared to the 120 million"

people who died because of armed
conflict. The World Health Organiza-
tion had picked Henderson to achieve
“target zero” — the complete eradi-
cation of smallpox from the human

p population -—— in 10 years. ’

At the time, WHO officials were

. trying, and failing, to eliminate ma?

laria So few people, including many
WHO officials, thought the smallpox
eradication program would work.
But Henderson, with a budget of
$2.4 million per year from the WHO,
proved his superiors wrong. On Oct.
26,‘ 1977, the last case of .smallpox
occurred in Somalia, nine months
after I-Ienderson’s target goal.
Henderson spoke last Thursday
in Alumni Hall to launch the release
of his new book, “Smallpox: The
Death of a Disease.” The date also
marked the 30th anniversary of the

declaration that smallpox had been
eradicated.

Former U.S.iSecretary of Health
and Human Services Tommy

Thompson, who has worked closely

in Washington with Henderson since

Sept. ll to strengthen [the nation’s
biosecuiity, introduced Henderson
as aﬁiend and dedicated servant of
public health. .
Richard Preston, the author of a
nonfiction book about smallpox and
bioterronsm, wrote on the jacket for
Henderson’s book that his discovery
was “one of the noblest and best
things that we have ever done as a
species.”

Expert: Henderson's work high point of humanity

Smallpox, page 1

Henderson worked for the Cen-
ters for Disease Control before he was
chosen to lead the WHO program,
helping to compile statistics about the
feasibility of a global effort to elimi-
nate smallpox, which killed Egyptian
pharaohs 3,000 years ago.

Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon
General James Watt called Hender-

son to Washington and ordered him I

to assume the directorship of the
program.

On a budget that allotted less than
$50,000 per year for each endemic
country, Henderson had to cut a lot of
costs The international staff working
out of Geneva never amounted to
more than 150 people.

Most of the vaccinations were
injected by health officials working
in their own countries. Henderson
and his team coordinated the effort
to send them the vaccine and supplies
needed to deliver it.

In the first chapter of his book,
Henderson describes his most 
memory of the horror of smallpox.
He remembered Dhaka, Bangladesh,

in particular.

“Neither water nor food offered
comfort Pus-ﬁlled lesions covered
the insides of their mouths, 
it painful for them to even swallow
or chew,” he writes. “Flies were ev-
erywhere, thickly clustered over eyes
half- closed by pastules.”

At the outset of each new small-
pox case in the endemic countries,
Henderson and his team moved in
with the vaccine to form a  of vac-
cinated people around the outbreak
so it couldn’t spread to the rest of the

. population.

At the book
launch, Hender-  I
son showed a»
series of graphic
photos of a small
boy infected with
smallpox, which
is transferable be-

After the disease was officially
declared dead, Henderson was
awarded the Presidential Medal of

Freedom and became dean of the I

of Public Health.

He  worked closely with past
presidential administrations, especially
the Bush administration, to prepare
the world for a biomedical attack,
which could involve an infec-
tious disease as a weapon)

Since 2003, Henderson has

worked as a resident scholar at Pitt’s V
Center for Biosecurity —-— as part of i

a collaboration between Johns Hop-

kins University. and Pitt— to prepare .

. the nation for a potential biological
attack. .
. While introducing Henderso
Thompson told the audience he’s seen

few men who garnered the respect if

Henderson did.

“When he went before the U.S. ,
Senate, every member gave him a ”

standing ovation,” Thompson said.
“In all myyears ir1Washingtor1, I had
never seen that.” .

For the last 10years, the city of Pittsburgh and Pitt
have made pivotal policy decisions thathave made the
city more  to gays and lesbians
PittlawprofessorAnthonyInfanti, a guestspeaker
at two Pride Week forums earlier this week, noted
some of these landmarks _
“Inparticular,IhaVebeenhappyto see thePride

Van Horn also noted the city’s support of Pride

the busy stretch of LibertyAvenue between Seventh

Bruce Kraus as the .city’s ﬁrst openly gay councilman

During last year’s Pride W/eek, Mayor Luke Ra-

Pitt also amended its nondiscrimination policy

Pitt alumnus and former president of the Rainbow

was a long time coming, *

“I thinkt.hatPittis ﬁyeto 10yearsbehind our

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele declined to comment
on that remark,  that he didn’t think Amold’s
claim was substantiated.‘

“Raisingthe number of straight allies is abigpart

He added that the city has become noticeably
more receptive to gay people in his four years at
Pitt

‘ ‘There’s no informal ‘gayborhood,’ like in other
cities” he said “You donthavetowortyaboutbeing

“I think what’s considered ‘acceptance’ is chang-

But many gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender
Pittsburghers stillhave hurdles to overcome, 
if theylive outside of the city limits. P

EDITORIAL

For the ﬁrst time, the Justice

 Department transferred a Guan-
 tanamo detainee to a U.S. civilian
 court for trial. Despite complex
 questions and complications,
 this is important progress for the
 United States’ recommitment to
 "constitutional ideals.

Ahmed Ghailani, a Tanzanian,

 is accused of aiding Osama bin
 Laden and conspiring in the 1998
 bombings of two U.S. embassies.
 Captured in 2004 and held in se-
 cret CIA prisons until his transfer

’  to Guantanamo Bay in 2006,,Ghai—
 lani now faces 286 charges.

Obviously, the Justice Depart-

 ment is using this initial test case
 as a cherry—picked example that
E-the closing of Guantanamo will

 not necessarily result in the release

 of terrorists. Though he apolo-

 gized and denied knowledge of his

 co—conspirators’ intent, Ghailani

 confessed to supplying equipment
 for the bombings that killed 224
 people.

i This time, that’s a good thing.

 Too often, critics like Dick Cheney

 claim that the closing of Guantan-
 amo will free would-be killers and
 expose the United States to grave
 dangers. This case should prove
 those paranoid critics wrong. For
 both citizens and foreign cap-
 tives, this country must protect
 basic human liberties, of which an
 impartial trial is one example. At
 its pinnacle, a truly fair and equal
 judicial system —— for which the
 United States claims to strive —
 exonerates the innocent, but it also
 punishes guilty offenders.

 U.S. correctional facilities are
 proﬁcient at housing those con-
 victs. Anyone worried that de-
 tainees rnight somehow escape
 and endanger Americans should
 inspect the nation’s current sys-
 tem. Federal super-max prisons are
 fortresses from which no prisoner
 has ever escaped. Also, other fa-
 cilities already house criminals as
 heinous as anyone likely to come
 out of Guantanamo, including the
 Unabomber, the 1993 World Trade

' rorist.

 Gitmo trials key to
 revive U.S. im

age

Center bombers and a Sept. 11 at- 
tack conspirator, not to mention 
Charles Manson and serial killer 
the Son of Sam. U.S. prisons are 
quite capable of housing threats to 

citizens’ safety. That’s the point.

However, the justice Depart- 

ment must not only offer trials
to detainees with nigh-guaranteed
guilty viardicts. This judicial pro-

cess bears tremendous impor-33
tance in the restoration of the 
United States’ values and image. 
A perpetual succession of death 
sentences and life irnprisonments 
would cast almost as much doubt 
on this country’s commitment to 
justice as the continued denial of 
' habeas corpus. This can’t just be 
more merciless posturing to show- 
case the United States’ unchecked 
ability to punish anyone suspected 

 Krugnian innovative, but too idealistic

activismhasmadehimthechampionof '

of transgressions.
A recent Pentagon report found

that one in seven of the 534 Guan— 
tanamo detainees released without 
charge are “engaged in terrorism 
or militant activity,” according to 

the New York Times. This claim
conversely means that six in seven

are not. Also, factor in the likeli— 
hood that a few of those offenders 
might be engagingin terrorism for 

“the first time, following years "of
unjustified imprisonment.

It seems the biggest worry is 
that some people might actually 
be found innocent and releasedﬂg
Though this sentiment doesn’t 
spawn so much from a worry that 
false detention has created terror— 
ists. Rather, it seems to manifest 

from a belief that mistakenly de-
taining some innocents is worth
the risk of releasing even one ter-

This runs antithetical to the

United States’ historic‘ ideals of 
equal justice under the law. Since 
President George W Bush opened 
‘the Guantanamo facility in 2001,
some prisoners rnightifinally get 
a chance to touch that justice, so 
long as the scales of liberty aren’t 

unfairly tipped in one direction.

Ladies leave your eyebrow shavers at home

Think back to your eadier school days
Remember those teachers who delighted
in punishing students? Every SCl‘100l has
them, or so it seems But when it comes
to stories about middle and high school

too quick to blame supposedly fanatical
teachers and administrators.

How  policies within
schools work is a complicated process,
whichreinforcesthe common belief that
teachers and administrators are unfair and
power-hungry

Swedishband brings love in June

by Kieran Layton
A O’ E E9itor

Love in October

The Smiling; Moose
8 pm.
$5 cover charge, ages 21+

October is still four months

away, but there’s plenty of love to,
go around, even though the love-
less events to a Swedish pop-rock
band’s tour would suggest other-
wise. I L

“We had a good start today,”
Erik Widman said.- “Our car got
broken into this morning.-The win-
dows were completely smashed.”

Still, Widman, the vocalist and ' I

guitarist of Love in October, re-
mains conﬁdent that the band’s
shows will be successful, especially
tonight in the Pittsburgh leg of the

tour. The _band will perform at The i

Smiling Moose in the ‘South Side,

marking the band’s first engage-‘
_ment in the city for almost two

years.

Though Widman doesn’t re-L

member muchabout Love’s last
Pittsburgh concert — besides get-
ting rained on — he said he’s sure
that there will be a good audience

. for the band’s unique brand of

pop-rock. ‘

“[The audience] will probably
be all over the place, because our
music’s all over the place. There
will be people enjoying themselves,
people dancing. A lot of our recent
stuff has been much more dance-
able, _so hopefully the crowd will
have a good time,” he said.

S_wedish indie-pop rock meets its maker at The Smiling Moose tonight, where Love in October will per-
form. Leave the ABBA oomparisonsjat home. .

With thoughts of ABBA in-
extricably attached to any Swed-
ish pop-inﬂuenced band, Love in
October’s sound is not so easily
classifiable. '

‘We ‘say it’s like Swedish indie-
dance rock. It’s deﬁnitely dance
music, but _with indie rock at the
same time,” he said. ,

Whatever the descriptors, it’s
impossible to give the band’s music
justice without hearing it firsthand.
Guitars and various percussion are
given equal time with a moog —
a synthesizer that simultaneously
calls to mindjdisco and rock mu-

sic.

The off-kilter sound can be eas- i

ily clariﬁed by knowing where the

band takes some inspiration.
“[Bands like] Franz Ferdinand,

Tokyo Police Club, Modest Mouse

' and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs are all

groupswe like,” Widman said.
This year’s tour also marks the

first time the band — completed

by Kent, Widman’s brother and

friends from Canada, India and

Mexico —. will play an interna-

tional show — ironic given the

band’s global pedigree.

It will play at the North by North-

east festival in Canada. later this

month. _ .
Attendees will pay a $5 cover
charge at The Smiling Moose, and
the show is limited topeople ages
21 and older. Doors open at 8 p.m.
and bands Almost Astronauts,

.Chalk Dinosaur and The Cascade

will play, as well. ,_

Widman said he expects people
to dance, perhaps mosh and gener-
ally enjoy themselves ——- and to be
overly excited. ,

“Bring an extra pair of under-
wear in case you soil yourself,” he
said.

Softball

Softball team signs fresh

by Lauren Kirschman
Staﬂ W/riter

Versatility is a word Pitt softball
coach Holly Aprile used frequently
to describe her incoming group of
freshman softball players.

In December, Aprile said the
Pantherssigned two freshmen for
next fall — Emily Nowicki from
Greensburg, Pa., and Krista Rod-
gers from Loxachatchee, Fla.

A third freshman — Holly Ste-
vens, from San Pedro, Calif. — will

also join the Pitt softball roster-
next year, Aprile announced last

week. Aprile said all three play-

" ers can help the team next year

because they can all play multiple
positions. '

Stevens, a catcher, was the 2009
Los Angeles city player of the year.
Her team at San Pedro High School
won the Los Angeles city section

title for the fourth consecutive

year. Heading into the champion-
ship game, Stevens had a .400 bat-
ting average and 31 RBIs.

She was named to the 2008
Press-Telegram Dream Team, as
well as the 2008 Daily Breeze All-
Area Team. i

Stevens is a right-handed power

hitter, Aprile said, and she pointed
to the versatility the catcher 
bring to the team.

“Holly is a huge for us,” Aprile _

said. “She plays first base, she plays
the outﬁeld, [and] she can play

3 third base, as well. I expect her to

really produce at the plate and to

_ really help us out.”

The catching position is vacant
with senior Sam Card graduating,
and Aprile said either Stevens or
sophomore Keli Gaynor will start
as catcher. ~

Last year, Card batted .277, hit
three home runs and had a team-
high 28 RBIs. ‘ ' —

“Obviously, it’s hard to replace
those numbers right away, but I do
believe Holly has the capabilities to
step in,” Aprile said.

Local recruit Nowicki attended

Greensburg Central Catholic High A
_ School, where she helda .460 bat-

ting average last season.

As a high school sophomore,
she had an 11-1 record as a pitcher
and was named to the all-‘region
team. She batted .631 as a junior,

recording a hit in all 19 games of ‘

the season, and was an all—section

infielder.

Tomei

by Adam Littman
A./dddta/It Sparta Editor

Heading into his senior season,
Pitt wrestler Ryan Tomei will start
for the first time in his career.

While he hasn’t faced the top
talent from other schools duritig
the past three years, last month he
competed with some of the top
wrestlers in the country. A

Tomei, a heavyweight, was the
only current Panther wrestler to
compete at the United States World
Team Trials in Council Bluffs,
Iowa. Three former Pitt wrestlers,
including current assistant coach
Keith Gavin, also wrestled.

They competed for a change
to make the national team, which
then travels to Herning, Denmark,
Sept. 21-27 for the World Wrestling
Championships.

But none of them qualified.

“I’ve never really competed in
something like that,” Tomei said,
adding that the biggest competi-
tion he’s wrestled in previously was

Clemons sprints to N

by Alex Oltmanns
Staﬁ’ W/riter

If Mycaiah Clemons thought her
collegiate track career ended after
the NCAA East regionals, she was
quickly forced to think otherwise.

She received word from the
NCAA championship committee
a few days after failing to qualify for
the National Championships that she
received one of seven at—large bids

. to compete in the 100-meter hurdles _
against the best in the country this

weekend.

The NCAA Championships are
held June 10-13 in Fayettville, Ark.,
and showcase the best 544 athletes

. per gender‘. . .. . . . . . . . . . . . .

“I deﬁnitely am really happy and
proud of myself thatI accomplished
this,” Clemons said. “It’s always been
one of my goals.”

The news came after Clem-
ons ran the 100-meter hurdles in
13.70 seconds at the NCAA East
regional tournament, finishing in
13th place.

In her senior season at Pitt, Clem- 1

ons has proven herself as one of the
premier female collegiate hurdlers in
the country. At the Texas Relays in
April, her time of 13.29 seconds was
the seventh fastest 100-meter hurdles
time at that point in the season.

A Pittsburgh native from Valley
High School, Clemons decided to

“The transfer was just for per-

fit!

to home,” Clemons said. “It was basi-
cally my immatuiity. I hadn’t grown
up yet, and Pitt gave me the chance
to grow up in a more comfortable
environment.”

She has ﬂourished since joining
Pitt, consistently posting strong per-
formances in meet after meet during

_her three seasons as a Panther.

Now she will continue to the
NCAA Championships for the ﬁrst
time in her career. While she said
she feels conﬁdent she can do well,
Clemons said with these types of
races, the outcome is always up in
the air.

“I always feel conﬁdent  into
my meets, but you can never tell with

like a sprint race because with hurdles
you have obstacles in your way, soeit
depends on how you approach that
race at that given moment”

While this weekend’s race marks
the end of her collegiate track career,
Clemons, a communication major,
hopes to continue competing at the
next level while possibly attending
graduate school.

' .“I’m still looking into it,” she said.
“I might try and pursue track pro-
fessionally. A lot of people around
me, as well as myself, feel I haven-’t
reached my peak yet.” —

rounds 31 through 50 take place

" And with postseason awards,
recognitions and a successful junior
season, Sedon’s chances of getting
drafted this week are high.

But that doesn’t make his up-
coming decision any easier.

“Honestly, I’m still 50-50 on

Sedon didn’t think too much about
the draft.

“It wasn’t really on my mind
during the season,” he said. “I just
wanted to play college baseball and
have fun.”

And have fun he did.

His 22 home runs, 160 total
bases and 65 runs last season set
Pitt single-season records. And his

 stolen bases led the Panthers.

Sedon started his career at Pitt
with a nine—game hitting streak
and held two separate eight-game

the season.

job.”

Jordano said he has witnessed
nearly 40 players sign profession-
ally since he began his tenure at Pitt
in November 1997. For as much
as Sedon brings to the Panthers,
Jordano said he still wants what is
best for his players.

“I am in full support of what-
ever decision Chris makes,” he said.
“If he gets what he needs to leave
early, great. If he returns to Pitt,
I believe he will be a legitimate
candidate for the Big East Player
of the Year.”

“[My teammates] want me to
come back,” he said. “But if I go,
they said they’ll still love me.”

For Sedon, the hardest part

about possibly leaving Pitt is walk-j

ing away from the potential that the
team has for next spring.‘
“I think our team will be even

.stronger than last year,” he said. “I in

think we made a big jump from the

The Panthers finished the sea-    A

probably the state championships while he
was in high school.

Tomei said he felt nervous before his
first bout, which he ended up losing. But he
calmed down after that, with the help of his
fellow wrestlers.

“You meet a lot of people —— a lot of guys
still wrestling and a lot of past champions,”
he said. “After every match, the other guys or
coaches come up to you and tell you ‘good
job’ or ‘nice wrestling?”

A less nervous Tomei bounced back and
won his next two matches in the tourna-
ment. First, he beat Jarod Trice of Central
Michigan 0-1, 3-0, 1-0. At the trials, the
wrestlers must win two of three matches
to defeat an opponent, instead of wrestling
one match with three rounds like during the
NCAA season. —

Tomei then beat Les Sigrnan 6-1, 6-3.
Sigman, now a coach with Nebraska, won
four consecutive national championships
for Division II Nebraska—Omaha.

In the bout for third place, Tomei lost to
Missot‘1ri’s Dominique Bradley 1-0, 1-0 to se-
cure a7/‘fourth-place ﬁnish for the Panthers.

 

Two former Panthers met in the 163-
pound weight class when Gavin fought Carl
Fronhofer, who has the fourth—most wins
in Pitt history. Fronhofer won the match
3-0, 1-0 and finished in second place. Gavin
ﬁnished fourth.

The last ex—Panther to wrestle was Drew
Headlee, who lost the only two matches in
which he competed.

They qualiﬁed for the event in April at
the United States Open held in Las Vegas.
While six other current Pitt wrestlers com-
peted at the open, only Tomei qualiﬁed for
the trials. '

Tomei said it was “pretty cool” wres-
tling at the team trials, but he also noted
he is focused on preparing for the upcom-
ing season. He will take over the starting
heavyweight spot because Zach Sheaffer
graduated after last year. Sheaffer was the
starter in that weight class for the past few
years, winning 107 matches, which places
him "13th in school history. .

“I’ve been waiting for a few years [to

start] ,” Sheaffer said. ‘‘I’m excited I’m going .

to get to see" some of the big name guys.”

I’ve never really competed

in something like that.

is a former Pitt baseball player who gradu-
ated in 1986. V

Emily Nowicki also brings plenty of ver-
ﬁftility to the Panther squad, Aprile said,
adding that Nowicki will likely play in the
outﬁeld, but she can also play inﬁeld.

“I think that she’ll be able to sure up
our outﬁeld,” Aprile said. “She can really
produce at the plate and help our offensive
attack, too.”

Similarly, Rodgers is primarily an out-
ﬁelder, but she can also catch, Aprile said.

“She’s got good speed, and she’s very
aggressive in the outﬁeld. I also expect her
to help us a lot at the plate,” Aprile said.

Rodgers was named to the Palm Beach
Post All-Area ﬁrst team and was her team’s
most Valuable player for the 200607 season.
Over the past two seasons, Rodgers had a
.543 batting average and 43 extra—base hits. .

/, 

She also played for the Davie Power—Black
travel softball team.

Aprile said she hopes the incoming fresh-
man class can aid the Panthers on the of-
fensive end, at which they struggled last
season.

Pitt’s .231 team batting average last sea-
son was 12th in the 13—team conference.
The Panthers scored 190 runs, which was
ninth in the Big East.

But Aprile said the Panthers aren’t just
looking for their recruits to help score runs.
The Panthers ﬁnished last year with the
fourth most errors in the Big East (66) and
ninth in ﬁeld percentage (.959).

“We are deﬁnitely looking to bring in
some offensive power, because that’s where
we fell short last season, but we’re look-
ing for good defensive players, too,” Aprile
said.
