Vol. 71 No. 67 .

BY BETSY NORMAN

The Allegheny County Labor
_Council (ACLC), in a move to
support the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences-Graduate Organization
(FAS-GSO), unanimously passed a
resolution Thursday urging .Pitt’s

' administration to abide by the

results of the upcoming March
23-24 mock collective bargaining
election for graduate employes.

FAS-‘GSO plans to hold-the mock
election to determine whether or
not graduate employes favor
unionization. .

‘ Pitt Professional Union’s ACLC
Labor Delegate Mark McCulloch
introduced the resolution to the
"ACLC, an organization which
consists of delegates from over-350

‘_AFL—CIO affiliated unions in

Allegheny County.

McCulloch explained although
the Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board i (PLRB) found graduate

employes to be Pitt employes,

the PLRB will not be ‘able to
conduct’ a bonafide collective‘
bargaining election until further

litigation determines whether or.

not graduate employes fall under
PLRB"s jurisdiction.

He‘ said the March 23-24
election, however, will measure the
same thing has a
spo_nsored election.

“The March election will give.

Pitt graduate employes the"
opportunity to democratically de-
cide if’ they want collective
bargaining. The Pitt administra-

' tion has the legal option to accept
these ‘election results and, in fact,

they should do so,” McCulloch
said. i ‘
Pitt’s Director of Legal Services

I William J. Hannan, who is also.

Pitt’s labor relations counsel, said

' in response to the ACLC resolution,

“The results of the election will not
inﬂuence. on Pitt’s
administration. The PLRB decided

  

labor-board .

they were students and until this
decision changes, we will treat

. them as students.”

Late last week, Hannan res-
ponded in writing to a letter from

FAS-GSO Co-president Thomas B.
‘Reddington, which informed Han-

nan of the organization’s intentions
concerning the upcoming election.

Hannan stated in the letter, “to
hold an election as "to whether
graduate students favor collective
bargaining. appears .'to be an
exercise in futility.”

Hannan further said the Chan-
cellor is on record that until such
time as the law classiﬁes graduate
students who are ~ paid by the
University as emplioyes rather
than. students, the University will
continue to consider them students.
and deal with them only through
their recognized student organiza-

‘ tion, the Graduate and Professional
Student Association (GPSA).

Reddington ‘presented Hannan ’s
letter of response to the FAS-GSO
at their noon meeting Friday.
“The _University doesn't believe
graduate -students; need a union,
but there should be no problem

with the University and the

election,” Reddington said.

. “The'University is not going to
attempt to stop us from holding this
election. iln my dealings with the

BY DAN ROSENTHAL

Pitt’s Black Action Society has
called for a boycott of Chances R
restaurant and bar because of
alleged harassment of a tenant who
lives above the establishment.

Chuck O'Neil, chairman of the
BAS political action committee, said
up to 500 peoplewere to meet with
Angela Davis after her lecture here

. last week, but those plans were
A cancelled after learning of

the
alleged incident. '
O’Neil said Chances R's owner,
Ernest Smallis, who owns and
leases the apartments over Chances
R, used racial slurs, threw Sabrina
Gibson’s stereo ‘on .the floor and
prevented her from calling the
police when he visited her
apartment to collect rent February

Smallis said Friday he knows
nothing about Gibson’s stereo.

According to O'Neil, Smallis
visited Gibson’s apartment to
collect rent and she questioned him
about a lack of heat and hot water.
She had allegedly asked him earlier
about the temperature in her

iness Cause

_ “different” from other children,

she said. _
Ten to 15 percent of the abusers

are psychotic and the children tend '

to _ be part of the psychotic
:‘d1llus1onal system.” The remain-
ing percent of parents - abuse
children as the result of many types
of anxieties, Evans explained.

‘ “I don’t think child abuse is on
the rise,” Evans said, -‘ ‘it's just that
today abused kids are being
identified.” v

She explained the attitude of
agencies has changed‘in cases of
abused children. “There was a time

.when children were thought to be

the property of their parents, but
today there is a- mandatory
reporting law. ”

Chairman of Mercy Hospital's
Department of Pediatrics, "Robert
Chabon said, under the Pennsyl-
vania State Child Abuse Law there
is a penalty in willfully failing to
report a case of child abuse.

“You aren’t liable if you were
wrong about your personal diagno-
sis because the good faith of a
person required to report child
abuse is assumed under the law,”
he said. - ,

.‘‘The obligation of the pediatri-
cian is to diagnose what abuse has
been inﬂicted, perhaps malnutri-
tion or beating, then provide
protection for the child in the form
of hospital care,” said Holly Davis, '

"assistant professor of clinical

pediatrics at Children's Hospital. '

apartment and “lukewarm” water .2 "fl:
in the bathroom. Smallis refused to :  

‘hear her inquiries and, .using
profanity. demanded the money,-
O’Neil said.

When Gibson, a black, decided to H

delay payment in order to check her

rights to «apartment maintenance; 

Smallis said, “Give me the money
or I'll turn your face white,” O’Neil
said.

Joe Farro, crime prevention

worker for People’s Oakland, -‘an 
Oakland citizens’ group with an 
interest in landlord/tenant cases, p 

said Gibson ﬁled a complaint with

' them saying she got frightened _

hearing Smallis’ remarks ' and
attempted to call the policer

_ “When she picked up the phone
to call the police,” Farro said,

“Smallis hung up the phone, threw .

Sabrina’s stereo out in the hall and
stormed out of the apartment.”

- “She has given me trouble since ‘

she moved in,” Smallis said.

“She’s three months behind in herll

rent and has paid only $40 of a $175
security deposit.”

Smallis said he has tried, 
repeatedly to collect the rest of the A i A '

security deposit and back rent but
has had no success.

O'Neil said BAS is urging‘ »
students, faculty and the Oakland 
community to boycott Chances R

until "restitution is made for
Gibson’s stereo. He said a damage
estimate is being prepared.

An Open Letter
A to Jewish Students:

You know that there are troubled and deprived
Jews in the cities of America, the development
towns of Israel, the remnant communities of Eur-
ope, the ghettos of North Africa . . .

You know that our actions will shape the fu-
ture of Jewish surviva1——_for the people of Israel
who sacrifice to keep our dream alive, for Soviet
Jews who struggle for freedom, for those who re-
main oppressed in foreign lands, and for those here

" at home who are in need of our aid.
I But knowing has never been enough . . . . .

Your generous contribution to the Campus
Campaign for Israel and World Jewry is a positive
response to your knowledge; it reaffirms the fact
that we are one people.

This week you will be contacted by the Campus
Campaign—please make your commitment in the

form of a pledge.

in Gibson’s apartment and found
nothing wrong. She also said there
has been “plenty of hot water” in

Fight Against Crime

The crime ﬁght initiated by the People’s Oakland neighborhood group
and Oakland’s No. 4 police station is without question a big step in the
drive to improve the quality of life in Oakland. But it won’t work without
the effort of one of the largest socio-economic groups in the area—the

‘ students.

A quixotic effort by campus political self-interest groups would not
providethe student effort needed. A successful push against crimewill
occur only when the average student joins the ﬁght.

This does not imply that each block should organize vigilante groups
to help the police. The best way students, both on and off campus
residents, can help is by attending the educational meetings People’s
Oakland and the police plan to hold. '

Ar; atmosphere of isolation has pervaded Oakland for the past few

9

years. Students seem transient by the standards of lifelong residents,
preventing the development of normal neighborhood relationships.
Without neighborhood solidarity, crime ﬂourishes.

Students are indirectly blamed for Oakland crime. If they weren’t
here, some say, thieves would not be attracted by their stereos,

televisions and other valuables.

Attitudes like this do not promote a good University-cormnunity
relationship. It should be realized that problems are not solved by
ﬁnding someone to blame for the cause. The solution comes through

attacking the problem's root.

Flhe right attack to the crime problem is through community education.

‘And that means the entire community. Neighborhoods that know how to

prevent crime, and how to help the police once a crime occurs belong to
an Oakland that is a nicer place to live.

A residns Ply By Phone

third caller’s deep rooted foreign
policy question dealt with the New
York Yankees visiting Cuba.

BY LEN ROMBERG

President Carter’s two-hour
phone-in has been the greatest
political play yet, carrying the
football for more yards than
anything Gerald Ford or his
predecessors have done. Carter
had (and has) everything to gain
and nothing to lose.

Via a Walter Cronkite greeting (a
novelty for most Americans in
itself), the President listened to
complaints, comments, praises and
questions from an unscreened,
supposedly random crossgsection of
ordinary, everyday citizens.

Reader Refutes UGE Stand  

Last November the Concerned
Black Students (CBS) set forth a list
of demands while holding the SGB
prisoner. Three months later,
these demands have not been met
and the Union of Graduate
Employees (UGE pledges its
support with a list of concerns
published in the Pitt News Feb. 23.

People of UGE, I would like you
take a good, long look at what is
stated in the letter, and ask a few
simple questions. The answers may
surprise you.

Recent figures show that black
enrollment has dropped. Why? Do
you believe there is an administrat-
ion conspiracy to exclude blacks? If
you think there is. you are wrong.

The admissions practice at this
University has made it possible for
almost anyone to be admitted—all
he has to do is go through the paper

work. If blacks, or anyone else,
cannot find the ambition or time to

apply to this University, why should
the administration put forth effort?
What do you want done? Construct
a drafting system?

Tuition hikes have. made college
more expensive. Why? Well,
maybe the problem has an answer
within your own group’s recent
actions. In the same issue of the Pitt
News on page one, there is an
article that describes how the UGE
plans to hold a collective bargaining
election. I suppose you will ask for
more money, among other things.
The list of concerns on page ﬁve
include the University supplying
housing, social activities, support
services. expanded U-CEP, up-
graded black studies and sponsor-
ing special programs for the
community. No wonder college is
getting more expensive. Have you
guestioned where all the money

Letter Calls
Cooper

Racism Victim

We were dismayed to read of
Kevin Cooper being placed on
disciplinary probation which may
force him to resign his position as
CBAS Chairman (Pitt News, 2/9/.
77). This decision was made
despite Cooper's assertion that the
charges against him were unjusti-
ﬁed and that he was “in fear of
bodily harm" when the incident
occurred. We hope that neither
Cooper nor BAS will be intimidated
by such tactics and that they will
continue to defend the interest of
black students at the University.

Cooper's experience epitomizes
_the dilemma of the black student at
Pitt who must struggle against the
racist atmosphere present at this
University. This poisoned atmos-
phere is fostered by the practices of
the administration of the Univer-
sity. The diversity and depth of
such. practices generally remain
unknown to each individual victim.

The Student Committee to Defend

From beginning to end, Carter
conversed in a relaxed, “Hi, how ya
doin’ ” atmosphere, leaving all the
cut-offs and other not so nice
activities to Cronkite. Always in a
friendly tone, Jimmy either an-
swered the folks or promised to call
back later.

.His play by phone worked
supreme. No doubt the presidential

popularity poll will show the

- beneﬁt reaped from this ﬁrst-time

occasion.

Even when the conversation got
rough, Carter was able to manage.
Ronald Fouse of Centerville,
Georgia, asked, “Now that you’ve-
pardoned the draft evaders and you
propose to pardon the junkies and
deserters, do you propose to do
anything for the veterans?”

Carter responded, “Well I’

thought I might get a friendlier
question from Georgia.”

As for content, Carter was asked
questions pertaining mostly to
domestic issues—income tax forms,
jobs, social security and why his son
lives in the White House. However,
the very ﬁrst question dealt with
this past week’s world star in the
spotlight-—Idi Amin.

“We did act, I think, forcefully
and effectively with Amin,” Carter
said to Joseph, Willman of Sterling
Heights, Michigan. As the two
hours wore on,.42 callers out of
perhaps millions of attempts
reached the chief executive.

Not screening the phone calls for
nonsense was a noble gesture, but
it maintained some ridiculous
inquiries which might have, and
should have been eliminated. The

Despite the fact the Cubans have
had enough Yankee exploitation,
the President said,- “It’s a
possibility, yes.”

He used his air of “cool” when
speaking to Nick Kniska of Lanham,
Maryland, about family expenses in
the White House. “We’re not
mooching off the American tax-
payers, ” Carter declared.

Other questions included pleas to
save a caller’s father from cancer,
cute calls from grade school

children and help to secure a civil ,

service job. Surprisingly. Carter
promised to look into that person’s

. employment application.

An amazed Cronkite added, “I
bet," Miss Pfenninger, when they
told you the best way to get a job is
just knock on a lot of.doors, they
didn’t ever suggest telephoning the
President on a national call-in show,
but it seems to work. You are going
to get an answer from him.”

‘ But all those unusual, petty,
personal calls did not downgrade
the program. Jimmy’s patience,
ability to listen and deal with those
calls just shined his image further.

The people are bound to like _the

idea of a President making an effort _

to reach out to them.

The press will also love these talk
shows, for they add creativity to
political coverage, giving the
networks an easy boost in ratings.
So with everyone behind Carter’s
“Dial the President” system, he
will ride a high level of popularity
until he makes his first blunder.

Letters To The Editor

Tower C Room
Allotment Unfair

Iwish to bring _to the attention of
the student body what I feel is a
blatant example of injustice con-
cerning the eligibility for living in
Tower C (single room accommoda-
tions). In catalogs distributed to
prospective freshmen, it is stated
that a single accommodation shall
be awarded to the ' student “if
possible” should he or she be
eligible for an accommodation..
Otherwise, the student is given a
random double or triple accommo-
dation and has little to say in the
matter.

This is ﬁne except that certain
incoming freshmen get preference

1 over other incoming freshmen in the

awarding of single rooms. These

freshmen with preference usually-

turn out to be athletes on _full
scholarships or students on Chan-
cellors’ scholarships. When‘ I
applied for freshman year housing,
I applied 10 months before the start
of the subsequent fall. term. I
indicated a desire -for a single room
but since I was just an average
student here on grants and loans, I
was refused. Yet several athletes

‘ who were recruitediseveral months

after I was accepted were given
preference over me. I

I feel the housing office must
devise a room award plan fair to all,
regardless of what the person's
circumstances are. Otherwise, the

integrity of the University is at

stake.

Top Billing For
Victim No Pri2:_e

If John Wilbor and Dr. Curtiss'

Porter feel that Carleen Curry was
slighted by the press after her tragic
death, and that press coverage of
Patricia Hostetler was “compas-
sionate and humane,” then there is
nothing which can be said to refute
their conclusions of incipient
racism. ’

However, I can’t believe that the
family and friends of Miss Hostetler
relish the “top billing” she has
received. I was personally shocked
and outraged at the frontpage story
headlined “Blast Ends Pitt Ro-
mance’ ’ in which a Pittsburgh Press
or Post Gazette reporter more

‘Curry shares in my relief that no -

I echo the concern of Mr. Wilbor

purged at both the deliberate and ‘

unconscious levels; but this event
hardly lends itself to a discussion of
racial discrimination. If anyone’s

humanity and dignity were violated,

in this case, it was Patricia

NEW YORK—Some things sell
' themselves. '

The Giostorino Super Strada is an
Italian-built precision‘ road mach-
ine. It is made entirely by hand
from the ﬁnest steel and aluminum

_alloy. Its ﬁnish is deep lusterous

blue. It weighs less than 21 lbs. and
costs $975.

The Giostorino is a bicycle, a road
racer, designed to do just one thing
we1l~‘to take power from a pro rider
and put it to the ground. ‘

Bicyclists are known for their
weaknesses. The worst of these_is a
perpetual hunger for the very
newest equipment and gadgets. '
The Giostorino is a classic, so it is
forever new. But every year there
are avant-garde components com-
ing out. And like all’ debutantes,

they need a party at which they can
be presented to society. In this case
the cotillion was the 18th Annual
International Cycle Show held at the
New York Coliseum recently.

The show is strictly a trade affair
designed to allow dealers to see the
wares of importers, manufacturers
and distributors. The public is
decidedly unwelcome.

ahr, ackIeBilgist, Aaits Draft  

BY KAREN KADILAK

Football season has been over for
three months. . For the senior
members of Pitt’s victorious Sugar

Bowl team, it’s been sort of an idle‘

time. There's no spring practice,
which means no wind sprints, no
full-pad scrimmages and no team
meetings. . '

_ A For those Panther seniors, things
will probably remain at the same
slow-paced tempo until early May
whe he Nat’ nal- Football Lea e

 

     
 
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
    
 
  
 
 
 

will tentatively hold its annual
player's draft.

John Hanhauser, Pitt left offen-
sive taclde, is oneof the graduating
members ‘of the number one

-football team who has his sights

deﬁnitely set on a professional
football career.

‘ “I just want to play pro
football,”- the 6-3, 252-pounder

I said when quizzed about his future

plans. “I don’t care who drafts me,
eithr. The Steelers, the'Bears. the

   

Pitt tackle
John Han-
hauser (64)
saw. much of

‘Pitt's 12-o,
number-one
season from
a prone posi-
tion.

Cowboys, the Dolphins, even one
of the expansion teams. I just want
to play_ professional football,
anywhere.”

’ Fortunatelyifor the determined
Erie native, his chances of catching
on with an NFL team appear as
deﬁnite as his aspirations. The
rugged senior has all the physical

tools that professional‘ coaches and

scouts drool over—strength, quick-

ness, aggressiveness and intelli-

gence.

But those attributes, no mattei
how desperately they may be
wanted by a professional team,
won’t make days go any faster. So
biding ‘his time until May,
Hanhauserlhas done some heavy
soul-searching about the future and
what it holds for him not only as a
football player, but also as a
person. - I

"After school’s over, I want to
travel for a few ‘months, " Hanhaus-
er said. “Maybe see the Paciﬁc

, Northwest, the Paciﬁc Coast, the

Southwest. Maybe even take a

_ Caribbean cruises‘ ’ ~

“And when I do get ajob,” he
continued, “it’ll probably be one in

I either environmental biology or

wildlife biology. I love the

  

. out_doors. o'r I’d like to be a high

school football coach-. I really like

to work with kids.”

But those are future priorities.
Now, as he,waits for May to roll
around, Hanhauser is concentrat-
ing his efforts on his biological
studies and labs. ' A

Which leads to an interesting
question: how doe_s a pair of hands
accustomed to gripping, holding
(although that's a no-no as far as
offensive linemen are concerned),

clawing and pulling handle fragile
lab apparatus?

“Gently,” Hanhauser said with
wide grin. “You have to be kind of
careful in the lab.”

He maybe careful in the lab, but
on the football ﬁeld Hanhauser is
far from careful—or gentle. Come
to think of it, a gentle offensive

tackle probably wouldn’t be antici- '

innovation on the part of major
builders.
front freewheel system, now
available on Panasonic and Fuji
bikes, which allows gear shifting in
virtually any situation.

Weyless had its new line of
quick-release sealed bearing hubs
and pedals, that was equal or better
to the best Campagnolo equipment.
Raleigh and Bob Jackson showed
off new frames made with Reynold
753 manganese-moly tubing.

This year, the emphasis was on
customer (read - dealer) relations
and service, special advertising
packages and pre—season discounts.

Beconta, Inc. for. example,
(importers of Puma shoes, the
Addidas adversary) offered a new
line of cycling (cleated) shoes at the
special rate of $22 - per pair:
minimum order, 24 pairs. That was
to the dealer. Heaven only knows
what the shelf price Will be.

But the real news here had to dc
with brakes, radical transmissions,
the Osmonds, Spritzers and some-
thing called a moped.

Fully 40 of the booths taken this
year were used by moped

manufacturers. and there was even
a specialty mag_azme ﬂoating

Shimano introduced its ’

new transportation wonder.

A moped is basically a bicycle
with an engine built in, not added
on. The engine is either electric or,
more "often, gas. Mopeds are not
really new—Europe has been living
on them for decades——but until the
gas crunch, most states have
classiﬁed mopeds as m0t0fCYC1eS,
which meant insurance and a
special license.

There's beena dramatic reversal,
however, over the past few years.

" Mopeds are being de-regulated so

that no insurance, HOT special
license, is needed. On July 1,
Pennsylvania’s new law takes effect
with a possible result a campus
infested with mopeds by fall term.

Puch, Vespa, Batavus and
Kriedler are the major moped
manufacturers, but there are
dozens more. They should do well
because the product is cheap (less
than $600, no insurance, 150 miles
per gallon) and fun. Mopeds will be
here to stay."

Something else that should hit
with a rush, but soon fade, is the
swing bike, which Donny and Marie
Osmond used in a sequence at the

when a key lock is released, the
front rear wheels steer indepen-
dently of each other. This feature
permits the rider to make an
absolute fool of himself by tying
himself into a jpretzel around the
frame while trying to’ do the tricks
Donny did.

Real innovation came from small

specialty builders such as Phil
Wood, who is building the ﬁrst

A high-class disc brake for bikes. His

unit is made from precision-cut

_aluminum alloy,“ hard anodized.

Each weighs 15.5 ozs. and costs the
dealer '$96.— No suggested retail
price was given.

The other daring designer was
Larry Brown of IPD Co, His new
bike is called the ‘Alpha (a
second-generation model, the Beta,

‘ is forthcoming).

Rather than the traditional set of
gears, the Alpha uses a set of cams
that gives it a variable drive range
and the capacity to shift even going
up hill. The frame is aluminum and

the entire bike weighs 22-24 lbs.

Brown has promised that the Alpha
will break records in the summer.
Total cost of the bike is$1‘,495—the
price of genius.

  PPA Is Making Its Move

BY SABRINA SIGAL

When my friend Sue told H me
about a great old Victorian mansion
ﬁlled with paintings in the woods of
Highland Park, where ,she had
been taken to see a professor's art
show, I decided to phone there and
ﬁnd out the hours it was open to the
pubhc. _

Sue and I decided to drive out to
the estate only vaguely knowing
where it was. After driving down
Negley Avenue, from the southern
end in Squirrel Hill to its
northernmost tip in Highland
Park, we discovered two brick posts
and a plaque saying “King Center,
Pittsburgh Plan for Art.”

We turned in and drove down a

‘long driveway and saw looming

ahead the gray mansion at the edge
of a ravine. Complete with
Victorian tower, English folly
battlements and 22 rooms, it is the
paragon of Gothic haunted houses.

Because it is hard to find and far
out of many people’s way, the
Pittsburgh Plan for Art (PPA) will
move to Oakland this fall. The
administration has ambitious plans
for their new property (the former
University Lanes on Craig St.)
which they will own themselves.
The King Center was city-owned.

And yet, the old mansion has
helped create an appropriate

atmosphere for art. My friend and
I entered an enclosed sun porch
where paintings hung on the walls
or on racks, sculpture stood on the
floor or broad windowsills and
numerous canvasses leaned
against the walls.

We entered where once there
must have been a side doorway and
found ourselves at the bottom of a
long, unvarnished wooden stair-
case. Looking up we saw, at the
first landing, a majestic stained
glass window in vivid reds, blues
and golds and shaped like a giant
bell jar. Floors and ceilingswere
bordered’ with rich brown wooden

In Arena
Concert

On March 10, the England-based
Genesis will appear in concert at the
Civic Arena.

Consisting of guitarist Steve
Hackett, bassist Mike Rutherford,
keyboard player Tony Banks and
drummer/vocalist Phil Collins,
Genesis has achie_ved commercial
acceptance with the release of its
last two progressive albums, “Trick
of the Tail” and “Wind and
Wuthering.” '

A Pittsburgh concert favorite
even before the rest of the country
picked up on the band, Genesis is
famous for the sophisticated
content of its songs, intriguing and
complex melodies, and a polished
and moving stage show.

It would be wrong to label it a
“head band", but in concert,
Genesis strikes the ethereal chord
of the human mind by creating
musical and surrealistic mental
landscapes.

the People

These skills are used in helping to
shape and mold the direction of both
traditional and black theatre
towards community interest and
involvement.

The Theatre Arts program at Pitt
is designed to integrate the study
and practice of theatrical arts with a
broad range of theatrical and
related experiences.

Gillette Elvgren from the theatre
department said, “Community in-
volvement is important in all areas
of theatre.” Elvgren is planning is
organize and teach Childsplay, a
children’s theatre program, to both
black and white youths on the North
Side.

Documentary theatre makes
broad use of community involve-
ment and history. “Steel City,”
written by Elvgren and Attilio
Favorini, had a biracial cast.‘
Community involvement was ne-
cessary so that the lives of
characters were portrayed correct-
ly.

Elvgren and Favorini were
committed to serve an ‘expanding
audience, both within the Univer-
sity and beyond its walls, and to
meet the specific interest and
needs of the local community.

Cheryl Pasteur, a doctoral
candidate in the theatre department
at Pitt, works with both community’
and black theatre productions.
Recently she is working with
Childsplay as a playwright of
African stories, under the supervi-
sion of Elvgren. Pasteur is also
involved with the black studies
department and Kuntu Reper-
tory Theatre. ,

“Childsplay is concerned with
the educational and recreational
growth of children, while Kuntu
Theatre is the development of adult

actors for primarily adult audi-
ences,” Pasteur said.

Vernell Lillie is the director of the
Kuntu Repertory Theatre. She was
educated in traditional theatre but
has worked primarily with black

We wandered into a kitchen, where
delicate human figures were

walls.

led us over the shining parquet
ﬂoors, past two or three spacious
rooms used as galleries, into-a
large carpeted office in the center
of the house. There, she sat behind
a broad wooden desk amid
paintings. A violin concerto was
playing softly on- a radio.

“Basically, PPA is here for
people to browse and learn by
looking. It’s the best ‘way to
learn,” said Rebecca Berman,
executive director of PPA. She told
us that at the Plan for Art, people
can learn to derive more satisfac-

tion from art, can better appreciate
it by regularly viewing, comparing _

and studying‘ it. Also, PPA
promotes the art rather than the

Looking Under Lace Skirts

BY MREA CSORBA ,

Enter the world of _18th
century elegance. Wrap yourself in
the velvets and brocades of the
Louis XV court and sink into a
world of splendour.

      

Kathleen E. George is directing,
and Bernard McKenna and Mimi
0’Conner are two members of the
cast of “The Rehearsal,” by
Anouilh. The Main Stage
production begins March 10.

Leave the rudeness of the 20th
century behind, in a frolic ‘through
the truly noble, delicately‘ aristo-
cratic period of courtly history.
Relax into the lackadasieal chival-
rous decade in which everything is
done within the strictest code of
refinement.

It is a fantasy. That world, its
codes of behavior, its laces and
brocades, are simply extraneous
decorations and no indication of _
what lies below the surface. This is

what the. ,characters'_ of Jean .

Set in the 1950’s, the frolic into

of his aunt. He, holding himself
and his jet-set friends, to be as

the castle properly as well as allow

Rumours
Fleetwood Mac

9‘Warner Bros. BSK 3010

One way to dismiss an album is to
declare, “This is not a bad album. ”
That way you avoid dealing with the
speciﬁcs of how it fails to measure
up to certain standards of yours.
But sometimes there is no other way
to describe an object.

“Rumours” is not a bad album.

If you’ve followed the career of

‘Fleetwood Mac over the past 10
‘years, one ,thing you will have
noticed is that they underwent
metamorphosis practically record
by record. From straight English
blues to a jazz-classical-folk fusion,
through at least two kinds of rock,

_gFleetwood Mac has been one of

the most diverse and interesting
ensembles this side of the Grateful
Dead. _ 7

Their continual evolution always
resulted from the changing pivot of

_.the group, its singer/ guitarist.

' Christine McVie, keyboardist-
singer-composer for six years, has
never signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced their
signature, though her exceedingly
ﬁne songs provided an interesting
counterpoint to that sound. .

_ What each respective leader di
was to incorporate the backing into
his music, or else blend his sound

into another’s tunes, with, para-
doxically, no loss of group identity
or individual quality. Not unlike
what the early Beatles achieved.
Whatever countributed to this
singularity, it wasn’t democracy. A
sense of democratic compromise
pervades “Rumours” and that
detracts from its naturalness.
John Lennon said that the
Beatles’ “White Album” was really
four solo records, that the sense of

- unity in the Beatles gﬁisted in name

only. “Rumours" makes obvious
what Fleetwood Mac implied—a
lack of wholeness. All but a few
songs come off as superimpositions
of lead against background. Some
artists, such as»Harry Nilsson or
Burton Cummings, make good use

.of this technique, but here it lacks

cement. The most evident example
of this is in the group collaboration,
“The Chain.” One can almost tell
who wrote what part.

This album, however, is good in
many ways. Lindsey Buckingham
evokes the feeling of mid-60s Beatle
music. _ His high tenor is
appropriately enjoyable (as are the
voices of (McVie and Stevie Nicks)
and his guitar playing is as sparse
and determined as George Harri-
son’s was. Taken out of context, the
songs, especially “Second Hand
News,” “Go Your Own Way” and
“Songbird,” are as good as
anything they’ve done. It’s the

itseems, is terribly high.

IRISH F OLKSINGERS
AT CARNEGIE MUSIC HALL

‘T’ Tommy Makem and Liam Clancy

have reunited after a seven-year

professional separation and will

perform on Saturday March 12, 8

p.m. at the Carnegie Music Hall.

Makem and Clancy’s work is a

_. blend of the music and literature
of Ireland. They make use of

traditional Irish ballads and the

:-
)---.~.__,.I(r;-}=;,,;'_.,_.>:;,z,, * u..«.,',m§‘:'w$' :1,-.“. 2,

writings of great Irish writers such

T as O’Casey and Yeats.

 

Their backgrounds as well as
research into Irish folk music
provide a base for their perform-
ances: a call back to the
pre-commercialization of show
business days when art and culture
were more closely interwoven.

They formed a group, with
Clancy’s brother Tommy, in the
early 1950’s and performed togeth-
er for more than 10 years. On their
own, they have acted on the New
York stage and have performed
solo concerts,  ’ I

context that makes them lose
freshness. “Dreams” becomes a
reworking of “Rhiannon” and
“Gold Dust Woman” is not too

development project to determine
the amount of community interest
in art and to learn how to stimulate
more interest. PPA was designed
to bring art to the public instead of
conﬁning the understanding and
appreciation of art to them-
selves,

Many artists cooperated with’

Rice by lending their work to PPA
for circulation among the public.
The method then was the same as it
is today: anyone is invited to come
to the center, browse and borrow a
painting or sculpture.

One may become a paying
member and then have the beneﬁt
of renting paintings free of charge

When do you say Budweiser?

 
 
 
  
    

for the first month. Any work may
be bought, at which time any
previously paid rental fees are
deducted from the purchase price.
After the initial three trial years,
PPA beneﬁted from enough coop-
eration to receive more Mellon
support and to stand ﬁrmly on its
own through rental and sales.‘

All of the artists represented in
PPA are from the Pittsburgh
region. Their work is exhibited
throughout the area and the nation.
All work is screened by the PPA
selection committee before being
accepted for the collection.

‘Although PPA ‘has had much‘

cooperation and success, its past

 

bulletins have stressed the need for
more civic interest and participa-

tion on the part of the Pittsburgh 6‘

community. To stimulate interest,
PPA has sponsored, in addition to
individual artist’s shows, numer-
ous lectures and ﬁlms. I

Muchmore is needed. Sylvester
Damianos, president of PPA and
architect of the new center,
admitted that the low proﬁle which
PPA has been maintaining must
now be expanded.

Referring to the new Oaklandp.

location, he said: “We are
expanding our scope of services.

The idea is not to have more artists,
but to show a higher quality of
Pittsburgh art, in addition to
bringing in outside shows of

museum-quality which the mus-‘_/.
handle because of

cum. can't
scheduling or cost.” Being so close
to the Museum of Art and Scaife
Gallery, the new center will be in
the heart of Pittsburgh's cultural

activity. A

The renovated building will have’

a glass and stucco facade, a library
l0unge.on the first floor, exhibit
galleries on the second floor and
sculpture court on the roof. Mean-
while, workshops and other art-
related activities will continue at

’ the King Center.

The old, rickety, crumbling.
Victorian mansion. resting peace-
fully in the woods, has been a
strong and noble asset to PPA. But

the new ‘location offers thew».

Pitt tanker Jerry DeMuro, voted the outstanding swimmer by a panel of
coaches, led the Panthers to a record-shattering victory in the Eastern Swimming
and Diving Championships at West Virginia last weekend.

The Pitt men’s swimmers showed
what great editors they are at the third
annual Eastern Swimming and Diving
Championships last Thursday through
Saturday at West Virginia, rewriting the

_ record books en route to a lopsided

victory.
The Panthers finished on top with 498
oints (the highest team score ever in the
Easterns, breaking their own record set
last year by 50 points), followed by East
Carolina, 310; Syracuse, 279; Maryland,
_270; WVU, 241; and Penn State, 95.
Rounding out the top 10 were Marshall,
St. John’s, Rutgers and Villanova.
Individually, the Panthers shattered
three meet records, nine Pitt records and
qualified eight swimmers for the
NCAA’s March 24-26 at Cleveland
State, as well as an additional swimmer
for the Amateur Athletic‘ Union (AAU)
championships.
“This is the best performance we’ve

ever had in the Easterns as far as the
team goes,” said an elated coach Dick
Bradshaw. “We lost two dual meets by
a couple of points this season (the team
finished with a 7-2 dual meet record),
but this makes up for it.

“We’r_e getting the reputation as one
of the strongest teams in our section of
the country. Last year, we won the
Easterns and now winning them again is
going to make a lot of believers.”

The Panthers stormed into a big lead

from the outset of the meet last -

Thursday, piling up 162 points with four
victories in five events. Pitt won three
more events the other two days, but it

,was the fruitful opening day which

gained the momentum. for victory.

“I think it’s because of the willingness
of all the swimmers to work hard,-”
Bradshaw reasoned. “l think we have a
great program at Pitt. We were
physically and psychologically ready to
go in there and do a great job.”

Senior Jerry DeMuro, voted the

     

    Sports

meet’s outstanding swimmer by a panel
of coaches, repeated last year’s victory in
the 500-yard freestyle, setting new meet
and Pitt records with a time of 4:33.67.
Dale Pflaumer finished fifth in 4:38.39.

Pitt’s Mark Schuman duplicated
DeMuro’s records and also qualified for
the NCAA’s in the 200-yard individual
medley with a 1:55.05, while junior Bill
Wagner (1:56.83) and sophomore Bill
Moser (1:59.71) came in fourth and
sixth, respectively.

The event the Panthers failed to win

came next when freshman Tom Sveta
(21.92), junior Dave Civis (21.97) and
sophomore Steve Leach (22.01) finished
far off the pace in the 50-yard freestyle
event. But Pitt rebounded in the one-
meter diving with senior Tom Fatyol’s
top score of 453.80. Dave Reeder
(fourth), Scott Winkler (fifth) and Jeff
Shaffer (seventh) also performed well.
' Ending the first day of competition,
Pitt’s 400-yard medley relay of junior
Neal Wallace, senior John Schepner,
Schuman and Wagner set a new school
record with a 3:30.58 clocking which
qualifies for the NCAA’s,

On Friday, the Panthers slowed down

some, but still managed to set four Pitt _ l

records, one meet record and qualify for
the NCAA’s in two events. In the 400-
yard individual medley, DeMuro set a
school mark, but finished second in

Skaters Fool Bobcats

BY STEVE SYBERT

ATHENS, Ohio—l'n the manner that-

characterized much of its season, the Pitt
hockey team played Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde under a full moon against Ohio
University here Friday and Saturday,
mixing together an excellent first game
and winning, 8-2, before making an
about-face and falling’, 6-1.

The Panthers, who finished the season
at 12-S-1 for their sixth winning season
in as many years, walked into a foggy
Ohio U. rink Friday evening and before

the fog had cleared, held a 4-0 first

period lead. irked by quotes in the Ohio
school paper, Pitt was spurred on by a
feisty coach Len Barcalow who was
_ disturbed with the article. ‘

“They’re "nothing more than an
advanced high school team,” Bobcat
performer and Pittsburgh native Steve
DiGiacomo was quoted in “The Post.”
“We’re going to kick Pittsburgh’s ass,”
added teammate Rob McNeil, the
Bobcats’ leading scorer.

Well, the Pitt players thought
otherwise and opened the freewheeling
affair with possibly their best hockey of
the season——-a perfect mixture of skating,
passing, checking, defense and
goaltending that you’d think only the
Montreal Canadiens could display. The
opening period was the. best period
played by the Panthers in recent years.

With three power play goals and a hat
trick by leading goal-getter Curt Hetz,
Pitt silenced a large “Beer Night” crowd
en route to their third consecutive
victory over the Bobcats in the past two

season to win the Pitt invitational

 

It took the Panthers a little over four
minutes to get on the scoreboard.
Sophomore Tom Sherwin, who finished
the season with 25 goals and 23 assists
for 48 points, stole the puck in the slot,
put a deke on Ohio goalie Rob Smith
and tucked it in fora 1-0 Pitt lead.

A minute later, Hetz (29-23-52)
flipped in a rebound" off a Jeff Saunders
pass that was batted away by Smith, but
right onto Hetz’s stick. 1-letz easily lifted

- the puck by Smith’s glove hand and

upped the margin to 2-0.

Hetz scored his second goal with 10
seconds remaining on a Pitt power play
by picking up a loose puck at the Ohio
blueline, skating in alone down the right
wing side and blasting a slap shot from

    

the faceoff circle to Smith’s right and
into the far side of the net.

Hetz tallied his hat trick on another
power play goal five minutes later when
Sherwin drilled a perfect lead pass to him
at the Ohio blueline and Hetz broke in
all alone, deked and scored to‘ make it 4-
0.

Ohio scored once before the period
ended, though, when John Enmark, a
Golden Gloves champion, by the way,
outfought the Panthers for a loose puck
in the slot and banged it home. The
momentum, however, failed to carry
over into the second period and Pitt
made sure» of that when Dave Elson

Sophomore center Curt Hetz (12) notched a hat trick to raise his goal-scoring
' output to 29 as the Pitt icers split a season-ending series at Ohio Unlv., winning the

In the exhausting 1,650-yard freestyle,

The Panthers continued their mastery
in diving when Fatyol, voted the meet’s

-outstanding diver, captured the three-

The three will compete at an NCAA
regional meet this weekend.

Pitt ended the meet in record-breaking
fashion, setting a school mark and
qualifying for the NCAA’s in the 400-
yard freestyle relay with Civis, Leach
Schepner and Schuman finishing second.

“I was a little surprised with our team,
but very happy with the results,”
Bradshaw said. “We’ve thought all
along this was one of the best teams ever
at Pitt. And we have the best shot ever
at the NCAA’s. .

“We worked our way into Eastern

_p Front  :
Dukes Deserve to Be
Tournament Champions 1

BY JIM LEWIS

  

The Duquesne basketball team proved that it’s quality-—not quantity—that wins
NCAA playoff berths.

Finishing the regular season with a 15-14 record and the Eastern Collegiate
Basketball League (ECBL) tournament title, the Dukes have been criticized as a
mediocre entry in the elimination rounds at Raleigh, North Carolina, March 12,-
because they have a lesser quantity of victories than the 20-wins squads which
characterize the tough playoff competition this year.

Some go as far as claiming that Villanova deserves the title because of its better
record (18-8 and a National invitational Tournament bid).

But 1 am one who believes that the best team comes through. Duquesne may not
have 20-30 victories like nationally-ranked powers San Francisco, Nevada-Las
Vegas, or Virginia Military institute (the Dukes’ opponent in the playoffs), or even
'18 wins like the Wildcats—but it still produced the quality of play necessary to

become a champion when it counted. Ask league also--rans Penn State,
Massachusetts, or even Villanova——they went up against the Dukes and lost. They
put it together while the other ECBL squads struggled—therefore, Duquesne is
truly the champ and deserves to be in North Carolina more than any league
member.

Whether the Dukes can keep up this “champion" status against the nation’s
best depends on how well the team can play around All-American candidate Norm
Nixon’s usual brilliant performance. Nixon is indeed a one-man show, but if the
rest of his teammates think they can get by with just his -point output they are
mistaken—-it will lead to a certain tournament death and Duquesne will surely be
buried alongside the Villanova Wildcats.

A team by any other name

Duquesne isn't the only unknown appearing in the NCAA’s next weekend.
Such biggies as Hofstra (23-6), ldaho State (23-4), Utah (21-6), Southern Illinois
(23-7), Kansas State (22-7), North Carolina-Charlotte (23-3), Middle Tennessee
(20-8) and the winners of the world-famous Pacific Coast Athletic Association (a
Championship sought after by Long Beach State and San Jose State) and the Mid-
Atlantic Conference (pursued by the likes of Ball State, Bowling Green and
Toledo) have yet to be decided. The champs of those divisions get an automatic
bid to the playoffs. '

Don’t be fooled by the names, however. Just because these teams are virtually
unheard of during the regular season and totally ignored by those who determine
the press wires’ Top Twenty doesn’t mean they are sure to lose to ranked
competition. On the contrary, these squads will probably be more determined to
beat a recognized power and to earn national prominence—-they will be harder to
defeat than those teams which bask in the national spotlight. Don't be surprised if 1

Tankers Third in

BY JOHN FINN

The Pantherette tankers, led by Kathy
Stetler, managed a third-place finish out
of 44 teams at the Eastern Regionals this
past weekend in Delaware.

Stetler qualified for Nationals in five
events: the 50- and 100-yard butterfly as
well as the 50-, 100- and 200-yard
freestyle. Linda Hamner qualified for
Nationals in the one-meter diving
competition. _

Pitt also qualified for Nationals‘ in
three relays. Stetler, Diane Kluglein,
Nila Delesus and Sue Guyer combined
for a fourth-place finish in the 400—yard
medley relay. Also capturing fourths
were Kluglein, Christy Elston, Sandy
Moran and Delesus in the 400-yard
freestyle relay and Jamie Conley,
Moran, Elston and Jennifer Price in the
800-yard freestyle relay. V

Pitt coach Kate Mathison noted that

come up with a large’ number of big

six times with point-blank shots and
made the saves.

' “Larry played an extremely fine
game,” Barcalow lauded. An Ohio
reporter echoed that opinion, saying
Newill’s performance Friday was the
finest in a long time-in Athens. “Then
he came in and played well the next

her swimmers turned in fine
performances, despite the fact that they
all didn’t make the Nationals.

“Each of our girls swam well,” she,
said, “and each swimmer made it past
the preliminaries to the finals, which is
quite an accomplishment.”

Conley placed sixth in three
events—the 200-yard individual medley,

the 200-yard butterfly and the 400-yard '

individual medley. Guyer placed fifth
and sixth in the 100- and 200-yard
breaststroke, respectively.

In other exceptional performances,
Moran placed fifth in the 1,650-yard
freestyle while Cindy Ferraro took fifth
in the three-meter diving competition.
Price placed fifth in the 500-yard
freestyle. _

‘‘It’s really difficult to swim against

the second game and stormed us pretty
good. I thought the Ohio team picked
up a couple of patterns we were using
like when they put a couple of guys out
there to closely guard Hetz.”

If any college teams ever played like
high school teams, Ohio did Friday and
Pitt did Saturday. This time, by the six-
minute mark of the second period, it was
the Panthers who fell behind 4-0. The
defensive inconsistency which plagued
Pitt against the Junior Flyers, Princeton
and Dayton haunted them again and can
be held accountable for three of the four
tallies.

After the third goal ‘came with 9:59
left in the first period, Bradley was
pulled and replaced by Newill, who let in
three more goals, but played well
nonetheless. The fourth Ohio goal Came
on a 40-foot screen shot from the point.

The Panthers scored their lone tally
when Sherwin found Gedeon (the team’s
leading scorer with an 18-37-55 slate)
with a pass in the slot for an easy power
play goal with 15:45 remaining in the
second frame.

The Bobcats, who outshot the
Panthers, 38-35, in the second game.
launched at least a dozen more shots that
defenseman Rick Stein stopped with his
body before they could reach Newill.

“Ev_erytime I looked over and Ohio
was winging those shots, there’d -be
Ricky Stein laying on the ground like he
was looking for clover leafs,eblocking
shots,” Barcalow said.

That wasn’t enough, however, as Ohio ‘
rammed in a rebound off the back board
midway through the final frame, then

with the performance of all our girls.”

Mathison took a minute to look past
Nationals two weeks from now at Brown
University in Providence, Rhode Island
to evaluate the season.

‘‘It has been a very good season,” she
decided,‘ “and I ‘am really looking
forward to next year.”

Right now, howeveir,‘Mathison and
her team are looking forward to and
training hard for Nationals——hoping to '
do as well there as they did at the
Easterns. V ‘ — '

Hoopsters’ Welsh: Silence Is Golden

BY KATHY KELLY

Getting Barb Welsh to talk about her
basketball success is unheard of. Upon

“ talking to her, one finds a soft-spoken

athlete, and can’t help wondering if she’s
the same aggressive girl who dazzles the
crowd with the moves and passes of a
pro. ’ '

A sophomore, Welsh has started both
her years at Pitt. Hailing from Sto-Rox
High School in McKees Rocks, the 5-9
forward was her team’s top scorer for
two years, leading her club to section
titles and tournament play.

.‘_" The youngest of five children, Welsh

is the only athlete in the family.
Reflecting back on her early basketball
days she comments, “I guess I was what

‘you’d call a typical tomboy. I came
from an all-boy neighborhood and
started playing ball with the guys. By
sixth grade I knew that playing
basketball was what I wanted to do. I
started setting goals for myself back
then.”

Whether or not playing college ball
was one of her goals, she’s doing an
excellent job. Welsh was until recently
the leading foul shooter in the East and
islstill ranked in the top three—canning
better than 90 percent of her tries.

‘‘I’m really proud of my foul’
shooting,” Welsh said. “During the

summer I went to the playground and
took between 50 and 75 shots a day.
Even now when I’m done playing I shoot
free-throws while I rest.”

Surprisingly, after all she has
accomplished on the court and all the
time she has devoted to the game,
basketball isn’t the most important thing
in her life.

“Basketball isn’t my entire life,”
Welsh said. “In grade school and high
school it was. Now I consider it to be
more of a hobby.

“What is most important to me is
really knowing myself and how to
express what I feel, even if it’s against
the norms of s0ciety,”.she continued.

“Appreciating my friends and the little

things in my life mean a great deal to
me.” I

Welsh is just coming back from a knee
injury and thinks many injuries in
college could be avoided with the correct
care.

“Nobody takes enough time to warm
up properly,” Welsh stated. “Also,
there is a lack of concentration
involved.”

It was in last month’s Edinboro game
that Welsh suffered the knee injury that
kept her sidelined for most of the
Pantherettes’ recent road trip. A Sitting
out the Maryland contest, she returned

In state championship

Gymnasts Crawl to Top

’ BY MARK MURPHY

The Pitt women_’s gymnastics team
.took\its first tentative steps towards

becoming an Eastern power Saturday
when it captured the Pennsylvania State
College Meet championship, narrowly
edging Slippery Rock 130.3-129.0.

“This is the first time Pitt has ever
won this meet,” coach Donna DeMarino
said. “They have held‘ the meet for
seven years. I used to compete in it when
I was in college. This win is all part of

our great improvement these past three
years.” _ ‘

Pacing the Pantherettes to their
victory‘ over seven other Pennsylvania
schools were star freshmen Regina
Carson and Alison Hoburg. The two
hoarded all four event titles and were
also the top finishers in the all—around
competition.

Carson, a native of Belle Vernon, Pa., V

captured firsts in vaulting with a score of
8.9, balance beam with an 8.7 and floor
exercise with a mark of 9.0.. Meanwhile,
Hoburg grabbed the title on the uneven
parallel bars with a 9.05, her finest score

‘of the year. Predictably, Carson won, '

the all-around title with a 35.3; Hoburg
took second with a 34.2.

“The meet was close all -the way down
the line,” DeMarino said. “At halftime
we were only four-tenths of a poilntgup.
It came down to the last girls on the last
event. ,

“The girls competed in order of a
random draw and people competed all

,,n,day,” the third-year coach continued.

“We couldn’t keep a running score. We

~f§~didn’t know if we were winning until

5

«as.

they announced the scores at the end of
the morning."

The Pitt victory gives the Pantherettes
momentum and confidence going into
this weekend’s Regional Champion-

ships, where gymnasts try to qualify for . A

the Nationals.

“Our main goal next week is to If

improve our team’s standing,”
DeMarino explained. “We want to
move up from eighth (Pitt’s seeding).
Slippery Rock is ahead of us so we know

’ we can do it.

m »~    »

“Ever_vone’s score has been improving
all year,” she continued. “l expect the
scores next week to be the best all year.
Everyone isreally up for the meet.“

Though the Pantherettes have little
chance for the team title (thanks to the
presence of Clarion and Penn State) they
could pos.sihl_v send some individuals to

eglie Nationals held later this month.

 “When qualii'_ving"lor-‘lithe Nationals,‘

i ‘“'1"-".."; 53"....

:1: .,
‘.

if-your team doesn’t make it, you must
have a 9.0 average in the events to get
in,” said DeMarino. ‘‘It is designed to
keep individuals out, so it will be

_difficult for us to get people to the

Nationals.”

Because of the total dominance of
Clarion and Penn State, Pitt, and other
schools with young programs, fight it
out for _ smaller slices of
championship pie.

“In our region. with Penn State and

the

to the lineup in time to face Villanova,
Temple and Immaculata.

“Getting hurt was a real psychological
letdown to me,” Welsh confided. “I
was just starting to peak.”

As a veteran of both high school and
college basketball, Welsh is in a
position to compare the two.

“The biggest difference is discipline,”
the sophomore said. “There’s next to
none in high school but here there is so
much."

The only aspect of college athletics

that Welsh does not approve of is the
priority men get in the choice of practice
time and place.

“Last Year we had to practice in Trees
Hall,” she complained. “The guys
always got to use the Field House. There
was no compromising. This year the
girls had to give in again. We practice
early in the morning because otherwise
we wouldn’t be able to use the }nain
court.” I

According to Welsh, crowds can have
a very heavy influence on women’s
basketball.

“Each year the crowds get bigger and
the excitement of a large crowd helps
you,” she pointed out. ‘‘I like playing

best in a preliminary game because of the ,

excitement of playing before guys. It
also gives as a better opportunity to
show the talent of women.’’,
And of Barb Welsh.
/

l

Clarion, there is an unusual situation,”
DeMarion said. “There are only one or
two teams in the nation who can come
near them. We make no bones that they
were not at the meet Saturday and they
would have beaten us, but they are
contenders for "the national title so to
lose to them is certainly no disgrace.”

If DeMarino’s program continues to
improve as it»/has been these past three
years, it shotildn’t be long before Pitt is
one of the power elite.

 

_Pantherette' roundballer Barb Welsh (22) may not say much, but her

accomplishments speak for themselves.

The sophomore from McKees Rocks is

one of the top foul shooters in the East, canning over 90 percent of her attempts.
