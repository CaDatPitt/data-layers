Recess   Views Bared

The question of whether the re-
cent recess was successful enough
to have another one next year is
being debated on all levels of the
University.

Several surveys are being con-
ducted to find out just how many
students participated in political
campaigns before a decision is
made on whether it will be contin-
ued. -

Dr. Jack Matthews. president
of the University Senate. report-
ed that the Senate’s Student Af-
fairs Committee is investigating
the recess to get information on
the number of people who parti-
cipated in campaigns and what
kind of political work they did.

SEPARATE SURVEYS
CONDUCTED

After the committee reports its
findings, probably sometime next
month, the Senate will act on the
committee's recommendations.

A survey is also being conduct-
ed by the Citizenship Information
Center (CIC). Jane Thompson, di-
rector of the CIC, reported that
her office is sending question-
naires out to students this week.
She also hopes to have her find-
ings completed by January.

Dr. William J. Keefe, chairman
of the Political Science Depart-
ment, conducted a small survey
in his department and found that
25 per cent of those interviewed
had participated in the election
campaign.

Leonard Saxe. a graduate stu-
dent in the Psychology Depart-

ment, conducted a similar survey.-

also finding that 25 per cent of
those students interviewed were
politically active during the elec-
tion recess.

FREEMAN EXPRESSES
SKEPTICISM

Jack Freeman. executive assis-
tant chancellor. feels that the re-
cess was not successful. “Appar-
ently. students just didn’t partici-
pate in a positive way.“ he con-
cluded.

Personally, Freeman was op-
posed to the election recess from
the beginning. “It assumes that
there is some controversy be-
tween education and political ac-
tivity,” he explained. “I fail to see
such a contradiction. Stepping

MRS. JANE THOMPSON
CIC Director

down from education shouldn’t be
necessary to taking time for po-
litical action.” And he added,
“Students have to make some
sacrifices.”

He admitted. however. “If the
election recess resulted in more
people becoming aware of the is-
sues. if more students of voting
age became interested in voting.
then the recess was worthwhile-."

THOMPSON DEFENDS RECESS

Mrs. Thompson rejected the ar-
gument that students need a read-
ing period during finals more than
they needed an election recess.
“It doesn‘t hurt anybody to have
those two days off.“ she argued.
“The lack of a reading period is
not a legitimate complaint; the
two days off for the election cam-
paign could have been used for a
reading period."

Dr. Matthews. however agrees
that "the whole recess idea seems
to be less than-successful; there
were very few who got involved
and used their recess time."

The Senate president also said,
“We ought to stress the notion of
involvement and responsibility,
but not chain this to a recess po-
licy.” He continued, “I’d rather
see us do some other things.”

Some of the measures Matthews
would like to see would be a
strengthening of the CIC. mak-
ing it a year-round activity. and
the year-round visitation of poli-
ticians to campus. He would like
to see students get the opportunity
to work closely with politicians on
a year-round basis.

Net Library Unveiled

After years of huddling over their books in cramped quarters, Pitt
engineering students soon will enjoy a spacious. well-equipped and
_ highly automated library.

The new George M. Bevier Engineering Library, located on the
first floor of the Michael L. Benedum Hall of Engineering, will be for-
mally dedicated in ceremonies scheduled for 2:30 p.m. Friday, Dec. 4.
The building itself will be dedicated next spring.

About 400 invited guests will attend the library dedication cere-
monies. Dr. H. E. Hoelscher. Dean of the School of Engineering, will
preside. ‘ E‘

The library, which contains over 9,000 square feet and has a ca-
pacity of some 38,000 volumes, plus space for microfilms and current
periodicals. It contains 157 seats, 88 carrels and 28 micro-carrels. In
time—as money becomes available—the library will be the most auto-
mated on campus.

It is the first departmental library to be linked directly to the au-
tomated circulation control system in operation at the central Hillman
Library. In addition. a new computer-produced book catalog designed
to replace the old typewritten card catalog will mean that copies of the
catalog can be reproduced cheaply and placed in laboratories, dormi-
tories and other areas where they will be useful to engineering students.

y Demonstrations of some of the library’s more futuristic aspects,
including facsimile transmission and computerized search of a num-
ber of technical indexes, will follow the formal ceremonies.

An open house will be held at the new library on the following day,
Saturday. Dec. 5, from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Area librarians have been
invited, and alumni, students. faculty and the general public also will
be welcome. The demonstration of the library’s automated functions
will be repeated, and refreshments will be served.

Students Can Register ’

To Vote Tomorrow’

by BILL GORMLEY
News Editor

Starting tomorrow, Pennsylvania residents who will be 18
years old on or before May 19 will be eligible to register to vote.

Unless the Supreme Court overturns the Voting Rights Act of 1970,
passed by Congress in June, those who register will be entitled to vote
in Pennsylvanias May 18 primary next year. The Court is scheduled to
rule soon on the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act.

Students who are permanent residents of Allegheny County can
register at the County Office Building downtown at the intersection of
Forbes Ave. and Ross St.. beginning tomorrow at 9 a.m. Registration
will continue locally through March 29.

Those who will be 21 or over by May 19 are asked to register in I

room 602 of the County Office Building, while others are requested to
register in room 102. The Allegheny County Elections Bureau is anxi-
ous to keep the two groups of registrants separate, in case the Court
rules that the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional.

Only permanent residents of Allegheny County may register at the
County Office Building. "If a student’s permanent resident is not in
Allegheny County." County Elections Director Will Alton told the Pitt
News, “he should register in his home country or his home state.”

Alton. who is hoping the Supreme Court will uphold the Voting
Rights Act. said the Elections Bureau will institute an on-site reg-
istration program at local universities. if the Court deems the Act con-
stitutional. He and County Commissioner Leonard Staisey are also plan-
ning to press for procedures to enable Allegheny County residents go-

‘Opening Doors, Black rmd’ S White

Stevens:

by CAROL SCATES

Perhaps the most frustrating‘

dilemma" confronting the socially
conscious student today is be-
tween helping others or furthering
his own ambitions. Maybe. as in
the case of Tim Stevens. he can
satisfy both.

Tim Stevens. student in the
Graduate School of
fairs. is both the executive direc-
tor of the new-image NAACP.
Pittsburgh branch. and a popular
night club singer around Pitts-
burgh.

Those who have heard him at
the Peyton Place and Nitecap
East can testify to his distinctive
sound. His repertoire. mostly
jazz. ballad. and some blues. in-
cludes Misty, Shadow of Your
Smile and his favorite number.
Jimmie Webb‘s Didn’t We.

Steven's music is an outlet.
“My music is very close to me,”
said Stevens during an interview,
“I enjoy making the audience feel
what I’m singing about.”

Desire "To Deal”

 

TKM STEVENS

When asked about his position
in the NAACP. he said. "I enjoy
my job. and the challenges. even
though there is a lot of pressure
and conflicts."

A petition currently being sent
to the national office of the
NAACP in New York requests
Stevens‘ removal as NAACP di-
rector because of his attempts to
get aid for Angela Davis. Miss Da-
vis will not be able to get a fair
trial. feels Stevens. because "peo-
ple have dealt with her beliefs.
rather than her alleged crime.
This is why the NAACP should
protect her rights.“

Stevens is‘ striving towards
making the NAACP more revelant
to the issues of 1970 by “increas-
ed activity, stronger stands, and
new priorities. Our methodology
cannot be the same as in the for-
ties.”

He joined the NAACP feeling
that it should be the leading black
civil rights organization. “The
name.“ he said. “is well known
and opens a lot of doors in both the
white and black commtlnity. in-
cluding the power structure. Peo-
ple both respect and know what
the NAACP is all about‘? Many

A of the new black groups do not

have this notoriety. in many in-
stances. within their own com-
munities. If the NAACP can be-
gin to attract the right individ-
als. no organization can be as
effective."

According to Stevens. those
who criticize the NAACP should
themselves be criticized for not
trying to change it. “They should
work from within to instigate the
needed changes.

Commenting on music today,
Stevents suggested that it is a re-
flection of our times- “It is vi-
brant, clashing, confusing, ready
to explode in any direction. You
never know what to expect. It’s
how they feel; surging, emotional
feelings.” He added that Sly and

the Family Stone is a good mix- 

ture and blend of both soul and
psychedelic, appealing to both
blacks and whites.

Stevens feels that his singing
and social awareness complement
each other. “Singing. especially
on a national level, will let me
have a platform from which I can
deal. similar to what I am doing
locally. My music will not make
me neglect my social thing. as

I most entertainers have done."

Varsity Marching Band:

by LYNN ALSTADT

The University's varsity march-
ing band has become a Pitt tradi-
tion at all home football games.
From its inception in 1911-12. it
has been progressive in spirit and
far ahead of most bands with nov-
el and revolutionary styles and
formations.

Making its first appearance at
Forbes Field on Saturday. Oct. 14.
1911. for the Pitt-()hio Northern
game. the band has since increas-
ed its size from the eight original
members to its present size of
120 men. undergoing many
changes in the process.

During the 1930’s all training
and administration of the band
was under the direction of the
Military Science Department.
Bandsmen then wore cadet uni-

Crime on Goat Island by Ugo
Betti will be performed by the
Chatham College Department
of Drama on Dec. 4 and 5 in
the College Chapel.

The Italian drama, which
deals with the universal con-
cern of justice, is open to the

public at no admission charge.

Miss Victoria Falco of Penn
Hills, a senior at Chatham, will
direct the production. She -is
the first student to direct a
performance by the Depart-
ment of Drama.

forms embellished by crossbelts
and pompoms and were introduc-
ed to marching in a highly disci-
plined unit.

The introduction of popular mu-
sic, improved formations, and
such performances as the “Big
Apple” in 1937 and the “Lambeth
Walk” in 1939 attracted nation-
wide attention.

Because of the large influx of.

veterans following World War II.
it was then necessary to also form
a 100 piece freshman band which
marched when a visiting band
was not present.

In 1955. the band made its fa-
mous appearance at the Sugar
Bowl in New Orleans. For its ex-
cellent halft-time show the band
received a standing ovation from
the thrilled spectators. Since
1956. the band has been making
two or three trips a year. climax-
ed by the annual Stadium Review.

In 1958, the band provided a
presidential escort for Dwight
Eisenhower at Ft. Ligonier.
Thereafter, the President was
moved to write a personal letter
to the Pitt Bandsmen exclaiming,
“Your famous"Marching Band’
more that lived up to its reputa-
tion.”

In 1964. the varsity marching
band’ received nationwide publici-
ty in Time magazine and others.
plus network TV coverage for its
first half-time show of the season.
Done for NBC. it was the longest
half-time show ever performed

Drill And Play Instrument

(Editor's Note: The following
Collegiate Press Service story rais-
es an interesting question, espe-
cially since the University's March-
ing Band is solely a male one. Of-
ficials of the Pitt Band are invited
to respond to the questions which
this article raises, as to why Uni-
versity women are not permitted
in the band. Research by Pitt
News personnel has begun into
the subject and editorial comment

. will follow after completion.)

LINCOLN, Neb. (CPS)——A few
years ago the fact that a school’s
marching band was all-male prob-
ably would have gone unnoticed.
The presence of today’s Wom-
en’s Liberation Movement, how-
ever, has changed all that.

Women attending Nebraska
University are no longer satisfied
that the only woman on the field
during their school’s football half-

, time activities is the traditional
1 “sunshine girl.”

At Nebraska,
women are not permitted to
play in the marching band.

Toni V. Hilliard of the NU Wom-
en’s Action Group said last week
that she will lodge a formal com-
plaint against Marching Band Di-
rector Jack R. Snider for sexual
discrimination with the Faculty
Senate’s Women‘s Rights Com-
mittee. The committee was first
set up for the purpose of investi-
gating the status of women on
campus and proposing measures

University has been doing. I say
this as an Air Force officer and
an alumnus of the University as
well.

The University of Pittsburgh
is shaking off the traditional role
of academic aloofness and in-
stead of being only a repository
of wisdom is becoming publicly
involved.

The University, with its qual-
ity faculty and bright, articulate
student body has accepted chal-
lenges and wholeheartedly en-
tered into the spirit of involve-
ment. It has seemed no matter
what the issue, curriculum
changes, student participation,
social injustice, racism, wom-
en‘s liberation, political activity
and a myriad of other concerns-
our University and its people
have become purposefully and
actively involved.

I have spoken to thousands of
people within the greater metro-
politan area on numerous occa-
sions and have honestly boast-
ed of the avant garde attitude
and thrust of our University.

Repeatedly I have capitalized
on what our University is doing,
not only in identifying and voic-
ing concern about problems but
also in sincerely and competent-
ly offering 1 solutions. Conse-
quently, I was quite surprised to
read the recent Faculty of Arts
and Sciences‘ report on ROTC.

‘ The committee was appointed

’ to investigate alternative ROTC

programs. However, the chal-
lenge has not been taken. The
committee has not only refused
to accept a challenge but has
side-stepped the issue altogeth-
er. The FAS Committee on
ROTC has copped out. They did
not investigate alternative ROTC
programs, but recommended to
the Chancellor that he influence
the federal government to devel-
op- an ROTC program- which they

to correct any existing pattern of
discrimination.

“I’m certain,” Hilliard said,
“that as soon as this comes to the
attention of the proper authorities
there will be a quick about-face in
the marching band's discrimina-
tion against women.”

Director of the school's band.
Jack R. Snider, announced his de-
cision to hold firm despite the ac-
tion taken by the women's group.

“It is functionally better to
have only men in the band," said
band director Snider. He also said
that women were not allowed to
participate in the marching band
because it is “very phsyical and
the weather is often bad."

Snider explained that his organ-
ization would have to be “quite
different” if women were includ-

 

not only did not investigate but
which was not proven workable.
Their charge was to examine
alternative ROTC programs and
this implied a requirement for a
program to provide officers for
armed forces of the United
States.

Today, more than at any other
time in our nation’s history our
armed forces need competent
leadership. The problems facing
the armed forces today are no
different than problems facing
society as a whole.

Competent men are needed in
research and development, log-
istics, operations and 1,000-fold
host of other important areas if
we are to maintain a defense
posture for this nation that will
guarantee our security, but
equally as pressing and even
more demanding is the urgent
need the armed services has for
effective, meaningful leader-
ship. Permissiveness, racism
and social injustice do not stop
once a man dons a uniform. We
too, in the armed forces are con-
fronted with the same kinds of
problems in these and similar
areas as confront society today.

The ROTC committee of the
FAS assumed a requirement for
men to provide officers for the
armed services of this nation,
but they have side-stepped the
challenge of how this is to be
done.

Instead of recommending an
alternative ROTC program. they
have conducted a philosophical
examination of the role of the
University and its connection
with big government.

The committee reports that
ROTC is only a small part. a4vis-
ible part. of a growing bureau-
cracy and as such is only an in-
significant part of the larger
problem surrounding an ever
encroaching, ever» growing fed-
eral bureaucracy.

This represents the essence of
intellectualism, and I honestly
respect that analysis in this‘

area. Nevertheless, we are still _

ed. He said there would be added
expenses for chaperons during
trips and the need for “different”
uniforms.

Hilliard disagrees sharply with
Sniderfs explanation. "As far as
sexual stereotypes go, Mr. Snider
is a perfect examp1e——this man
can say that women are incapable
of marching with instruments be-
cause the work is too ‘physical
and there is ‘bad weather.‘

“His narrow view does not per-
mit him to see as far as the near-
est high school’s marching band.
Was he watching a Band Day as
both women and men from all
over the state marched together?"

“The Women's Action Group."
she said, “calls upon those re-
sponsible people in the University
to change this policy of sexual dis-

crimination in the marching band."

/A:

FASROTC Reort a oout

confronted with the problem of
furnishing officers for armed
services that need effective
leadership.

The committee. early in its re-
port, pointed out that it was to
investigate alternative ROTC
programs and not to consider
credit. In the report, however.
the committee found it neces-
sary to announce that the with-
drawal of credit by the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences was a prop-
er step.

Many of us are still wonder-
ing what were the reasons for
credit withdrawal back in 1968.

This was at the heat of our in-
volvement in Southeast Asia,
and the divisiveness of that war
caused many responsible people
to do anything that would end
that war, but was it then, or is it
now reason not to face the chal-
lenge of providing officers for
the armed forces.

Air Force ROTC freshmen en-
rollment at the University of
Pittsburgh doubled this past
September. The program is aca-
demically strong. intellectually
challenging and well taught by
competent young Air Force of-
ficers. Any department in this
University. which experienced
a two—fold increase in one of its
courses that did not even receive
credit would certainly respond

in a positive nature to such an in-

terest in its course.

More than half of these fresh-
men enrolled in Air Force ROTC
are from the College of Arts and
Sciences which does not give
credit for these courses. I main-
tain that the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences did not face the
challenge of the urgent require-
ment to provide officers for the
armed forces of the United
States with graduates from lib-
eral universities such as the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

The armed forces urgently

Overcrowcling: The --

Accepted Existence?

by TOM LACHER

It’s Christmas time and you‘re in Downtown Pittsburgh, shop-
ping. Somone hurries by and knocks a package from your arms. You
bend over and the flow of the crowd almost knocks you down.

,You’re trying to get somewhere and almost can’t free yourself
from the stream of people. You become confused and annoyed. You
get on your bus and it takes almost an hour to thread through the
heavy traffic.

The relief you feel in getting out of town and away from the
pressure of the crowd around you is, by this time, more than wel-

come. 

Everyone has felt pressures, as in the above example and other
varied situations, from crowds. To most of us, it has become a facet
of life to which we must adapt. But it has not always been this way.

Indeed, our grandparents dream with nostalgia for “the good
old days" when life was slower and more simple . . . and less crowd-
ed. One situation for crowds to develop occurs when there aren’t
enough facilities to care for the needs of the people. But looking at
the myriad shopping facilities downtown, perhaps the problem is not
the lack of stores but overpopulation for just how many stores can
be built?

Look also at our schools, even Pitt. People cry for a “learning

atmosphere" of small classes and greater rapport with instructors, 

yet the large amount of students forces lecturers to speak over mi-
crophones and give notes over closed circuit television to over-
crowded classes.

Facilities just can’t be produced at the rate of expansion of en-
rollment, or in the first example, at the rate of population growth.
And since population increases geometrically, the situation is likely
to worsen. The crowding, and the pressures associated with it will
get worse.

Already our cities are expanding far into the surrounding coun-
tryside, and people must travel further to find recreational areas,
and these are usually found overcrowded. And they are also in very
finite supply. Escape from crowding is becoming more and more
difficult.

But what of the pressures associated with crowding? What can
it lead to? In experiments done with rats. where they were forced to
live in crowded situations, while the population increased. rats ex-
hibited tendencies such as homosexuality, gang rape, attacking and
tail-biting of other rats, and gang killings. Any of these already
sound familiar?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

 

Blacks, Capitalism,
and “The Market”

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to reply to Mr. Le-
Blanc’s silly little column in The
Pitt News of Nov. 4, entitled
“Does Socialism Fit in Black Lib-
eration?”

First a few words about “capi-
talism." Although I occasionally
slip and use this word, I do not be-
lieve in it, for I do not know what
it means. People who criticize
capitalism usually refer /to the
bourgeois capitalism of the 17th
century to the present, but I have
also heard of monopolistic capital-
ism, state capitalism (or social-
ism). mercantile capitalism, and
feudal capitalism; no doubt there
are more.

Strictly speaking, the term
means roughly nothing more than
the use of wealth to get more
wealth, and entails nothing about
who gets the wealth or how. So I
do not see the point of the social-
ists’ arguments, unless they are
contrasting all economic history
before communism as “capital-
ist," which is by definition, bad,
to communism, which is by defini-
tion, good. Or perhaps they identi-
fy capitalim with greed, and it is
really greed they they object to,
but that, too, has been found
throughout history.

Although I don’t know what
capitalism is, or at least not what

socialists mean by it, I do know
what I believe in, and that is the
free market (or just “the mark-
et"——or perhaps “free market
capitalism”).

This is true of conservatives in
general. For example, the “Shar-
on Statement," YAF’s statement
of principles——does not mention
capitalism. but the market. So I
shall, have to ask LeBlanc and his
cohorts to put the arg‘1'i‘i'nent in
terms of socialism vs. the free
market, else we shall be talking
past each other.

One wonders why socialists
never put the argument in these
terms. Perhaps ‘because it would
be a blatant contradiction to op-
pose capitalism to socialism,

which is (again) state capitalism; ‘

perhaps because what LeBlanc,
et al., really has in mind is com-
munism (which is, among other
things, complete economic liber-
ty, autonomy, and equality), but
haven’t the nerve to call them-
selves communists.

I do not know if Marx invented
or merely popularized the term,
but in any case he, and socialist
generally, always attacked capi-
talism and never the free market.

Perhaps he was afraid to at-
tack liberty, knowing that people
would quickly see through him if
he did, so he set up his straw man
called capitalism.

What is the relation between
the free market and the problems
of our black people?

It isn’t that the market enjoins
people to be greedy, for it pres-
umes that people will act rational-

ly, which means in their long-
range self—interest.

Self-interest, or the desire for
profits, is much weaker than
greed. And since the heart of the
free market is the voluntary eco-
nomic transaction. it goes without
saying that coercion and deception
are disallowed.

Further, people who are piggy
are less likely to be patronized,
because their less piggy and more
genial competitors will drive
them out of business. So even if
one wanted to be greedy, it would
be difficult.

It isn’t that the market is ra-
cist. True, people, or some of
them, are racists, but the market
isn’t. The market is no respector
of persons, whether black or
white, rich or poor; it respects
only ability.

The employer should hire, the
union should admit, and the con-
sumer should patronize the per-
son with the most ability. That's
how you maximize your profits.

It isn’t that black people aren’t
inherently capable of making it on
the market. LeBlanc seems to as-
sume this, at least implicity, and
it seems to me to be a form of ra-
cism.

In fact, although the picture is
mixed, which is to be expected,
black capitalism and black eco-
nomic efforts in general are mak-
ing headway.

In fact, it is the profit motive
that is the solution to poverty. The
free market has proved itself to
be the most effective means of
graduating people out of poverty
in histroy. (That it has not made
everyone rich overnight is hardly
a realistic objection.) There is
every reason to believe that it can
continue to do so.

After all. the inhabitants of the
slums are a cheap source of labor
and, being more or less like every-
one else and therefore having
more or less the same needs and
wants, they are a potential mark-
et as well.

They are not hired, because the
free market has been stifled by
government interference (e.g.,
by minimum wage laws and cor-
poration taxes).

Despite this, the fact is that
black people are making progress
—and due to the expansion of the
economy, not because of govern-
ment handouts. (See Mr. Livings-
ton’s column in the Post-Gazette,
Oct. 26; Newsweek, June 29, p.
68; and Mr. Evans’ column in Na-
tional Bulletin, Feb. 3.) We have
a long way to go, of course, but
the progress that has been made
should give hope for the future.

Socialism, by contrast, besides
being at least implicitly racist, is
a form of slavery or involuntary
servitude. Well-known examples
are the chattel slavery of our an-
te-bellum south, and the draft.

Wednesday, December 2, l970—THE PITT NEWS—Page 5

But socialism is another example,

for it is involuntary servitude to
the state.

Thus Soviet Russian, China,

North Vietnam, and Cuba, etc.-, «

are all slave states. That some
black people have embraced so-
cialism proves only that some
black people are stupid. Which
makes them no different from
some white people.

The free market is inconsistent
with greed, racism, and war. In
order to consummate a voluntary
economic transaction, both par-
ties must act in each other’s in-
terest.

The free market is obviously su-
perior to any other form of eco-
nomic organization——certainly. to
socialism——and as long as we are
pulling in different directions it
is little wonder that the road of
progress leads up such a steep
hill.

Cagers Shoot Down Bullets, 91-61

by JERRY MYERS

With a balanced attack that
gradually gained momentum
through the second half. the Pitt
basketball team overpowered a
small. aggressive Gettysburg
Bullets team last night. 91-61.

The Panthers were led by sopho-
more Carl Morris‘ 23 points and
11 rebounds. Three other men
reached double figures — center
Paul O‘Gorek (14). Mike Paul
(18). and Bill Downes (10).

Pitt Coach Buzz Ridl used the
contest to take a good look at
some of his sophomores and to
test his returning lettermen.

Some early popping --by Mike
Paul and Carl Morris set the Pan-
ther offense rolling, allowing
them to take an 11 point, 44-33,
lead into the dressing room at
halftime.

Ridl mentioned after the con-
test that “the game was never in
danger I was pleased with Carl

Morris and Ed Harrison (a 6-4
sophomore guard from Union-
towni. Well probably have eight
or nine players that we‘ll rotate.
making us physically strong on
the court. And Mike Paul seems
to shoot quicker and has more
confidence."

The 1.269 fans who turned out
to witness the Panther opener
were in for some exciting sur-
prises. Mike Caldwell. a senior
who led the cagers in scoring two
years ago. came in late in the
second half to spark a Panther
rally that pushed their lead to 30
points with ten minutes left in the
game.

   

Morris And ‘Roomie’

Agree About Panthers

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

One of the last two Panther basketball players to
leave the locker room after last nights opening vic-
tory over Gettysburg was a sophomore who had
just led his team in scoring and rebounding in his
first varsity game. The other guy was a soph who
sat on the bench throughout his first game.

The two happen to be roommates and Pitt play-
ers who have a similar idea about the things that
will happen to the Panthers during 1970-71 season.

Carl Morris is the sophomore who has broken
into the starting line-up. and he showed why last
night. leading the way with 23 points and 11 re-
bounds. His roommate is Randy Arnold. another of
many Indiana-born Pitt varsity players.

Arnold, who admits he will be on the bench most
of the season, conveyed both players’ thoughts on
what should happen to the Panthers, who played
.500 ball last year.

“Sure. it's different this year." he said after
watching from across the small dressing room as
roommate Morris handled quite a few interviews.
"They averaged about 65 points last year. What did
we get tonight . . . 911"‘

Gettysburg isn‘t exactly the toughest team
around. but the win seemed to be enough to con-
vince fans that more is new to the Panthers than
their bright Blue and Gold sweat suits that have re-
placed their old “whites.“

Morris, himself, was enough to indicate that the
Panther basketball squad is different. He proved to
be an addition that makes the Pitt tallmen up front

a challenge to most opposition.

His 23 points at forward. along with Mike Paul’s
18 and center Paul O‘Gorek‘s 14. turned the atten-
tion away from the Pitt guards. who have been the
publicity makers among the Panthers.

Leading scorer from last year. Kent Scott. played
little and scored only two points and Cleve lid-
wards‘ injury kept him out of the line—up.

But Panther Coach Buzz Ridl was pleased with
the efforts of his most effective guards last night.
seniors Bill Downes and Mike Caldwell.

Ridl was also satisfied with the first night per-
formance of his sophomores.

"l was real pleased with them.“ he said. “Carl
(Morris! played real well and lBuz7.y‘i Harrison had
some nice and steady feeds inside."

But the man who played as well as any other
sophomore tas well as any of the other players)
wasn‘t sure about his debut before it materialized.

Morris said afterwards, “The things really work-
ed out there. . . . I didn’t think they would. I was
mixed up in practice all the way through to Novem-
ber.

"But in the game I wasn‘t mixed up.“ he added.

Many different options on plays as a member of
the varsity team after a year of the basics with the
freshmen are the things that worried Morris. There
are about 33 options. he mentioned.

Arnold, who had just watched his roommate fin-
ish the last interview of the night agreed that a guy
could get confused with the 33 choices.

“It‘s more like 90.“ he quipped.

“Caldwell had a good night,”
commented assistant Coach Fran
Webster. “He’s been playing very
well in practice and he picked us
up out there.”

Kent Scott. last years leading
scorer with a seasons average of
16.9 points. had only two points in
the contest. both of them coming
on foul shots.

Ridl was not overly concerned
about Scotts performance. "We
didn't need Scott at the time."
said Ridl. “He only took three
shots. They overplayed him on
everything and a lot of other kids
had easier shots."

Sophomore Marv Abrahms was
sick all week and didn’t dress for
the game. Ridl said, “He would
have played some if he had been
well."

The Panthers as a team shot 51
per cent from the floor and a near-
perfect 94 per cent from the foul
stripe. sinking 17 of 18 free
throws.

With Cleveland Edwards out.
Ed Harrison and Bill Downes saw
a lot of action. Downes stayed in
for almost the entire contest. hit-
ting four-for—five from the floor
and two—for-two from the foul
line. Harrison chipped in with sev-
en points and six rebounds.

Leading the undermanned Get-
tysbrug attack was 6-4 sopho-
more from Swoyersville, Pa., Bob
Gongleski. Gongleski poured in
17 points, hitting on eight of 12
field goal attempts. The Bullets
had a rough time with the Panther
man-to-man defense though.

The Panthers stayed with inan-
to—man defense for most of the
evening. switching‘ only rarely to
the zone in order to shake up Get-
tysburgs attack. Their switching
tactics forced the Bullets into
committing 25 turnovers.

With a relatively easy victory
over their belts. Coach Ridl and
the Panthers look to Fordham Sat-
day and then to coming home
against Wisconsin next Tuesday.

The Pitt wrestlers. with a sur-
prising lack of recognition. will
meet the grapplers from the Uni-
versity of Maryland tomorrow at
7:30 p.m. in the Field House
for their first match of the season.

Coach Dave Adams hopes to get
off to a good start to prove some-
thing more than superiority over
the Terrapins.

Though they finished eighth in
the NCAAS last year. the matmen
have not been ranked in the pre-
season polls. Three teams who
placed below them in the nation-
al tournaments last winter have
been ranked. '

“We do feel that we should have
been ranked,” stated Adams, “We
feel we were cut off and we didn't
like it.”

Adams has experienced men
filling the lower weights. where
the team's strength lies. Randy
Payne. wrestling at 126. is one of
the most distinguished of the
lightweights.

Payne chalked up a 9-1 record
last season and placed second in

man to reach the final round. He
was also named outstanding

nament.

F rosh Victory

by MARTY HELLMAN

~ Led by Mickey Martins 31 points. the freshman basketball team
swamped Pitt—Greensburg. 94-61. in an impressive opening game vic-

tory.

The Cubs fell behind. 8-3. at the start but quickly regained the lead
and then proceeded to gradually increase their advantage over the

smaller Greensburg squad.

Besides Martin. the froshs front line of Jim Bolla and Bill Swartz-

man. along with backcourt ace
Sam Fleming controlled the re-
bounding at both ends of the court.

Bolla gathered in 17 rebounds,
while Fleming and Swartzman
had 12 and eight, respectively.

Although Martin started slow at
the outset by missing several
shots. he came on strong at the
end of the first half and had 12
points by intermission.

During one period of the second
half. Martin ran off 10 straight
points to increase the Cub margin
to 20. From that time until the end
of the game. it was just a question
of how much the final difference
would be.

Cub Coach Tim Grgurich was
quite pleased with the squad’s
performance. “They played a
good first game,” he said, “and

captain the team. Kuhn took third
place in the Easterns, wrestling
at 158, and sixth at the NCAA
tournament.

Both Kuhn and Payne are All
Americans.

Despite their strength in the
lower weights. the matmen will
be handicapped by injuries in the
190 and heavyweight classes.

Dave Young, who wrestles at
190 was put out of action by a
shoulder separation and heavy-
weight Ralph Cindrich is under-
going an operation for the knee
injury he sustained in football.
Adams expects to have Cindrich,
an All-American wrestler two
years ago, in the line-up by Jan-
uary. Jim Caramanng (190) and
Craig Tritch ’(HW) are the re-
placements.

Injuries have alos claimed a
victim in the lower weights. Pat
Lavery will be missing from the

-142 spot due to a pinched nerve.

Mark Paynes appearance is

doubtful due to failure to comply‘

with an NCAA rule regarding hair
length.

Overall. the Cubs displayed a
well—balanced shooting attack.
with Martin. Bolla. Fleming. Ken
Waggoner. and Gary Pagano all
taking about 15 attempts.

"This is exactly what you want
from a team.“ Grgurich contin-
ued. "It's good when several play-
ers are doing most of the shoot-
ing."

Waggoner, who guided the of-
fensive attack, stole the ball on
several occasions and led the
team in assists.

Fleming carried the squad in
the first half. picking up all of his
14 points then. A couple of his
shots were from the deep corner.
while the others were ti--ins and
rebound layups.

Grgurich stressed his pleasure
with the entire teams showing.
“They all adjusted pretty well and
they worked together.“ he stated.

JIM CARAMANNA
Replaces Injured Dave Young

Adams is expecting tough com-
petition from the Terrapins.
Maryland has eight top men re-
turning, and they have acquired
Terry Myers, a freshman who
was a Pennsylvania State Cham-
pion last year.

In their last encounter Pitt slip-
ped past Maryland. 19-17. How-
ever. the match was at Maryland
the day before the Navy match.
Adams felt that the squad may
have been looking ahead to Navy
and not concentrating on the Ter-
rapins. ‘

The coach feels that the squad
is mentally prepared for the
Terps this time and wrestling
them at home will also add to his
advantage.

This iswhat 
we have against
blades.

A shaver that shaves as close or closer than
the new platinum and chromium blades.

99 men tested our Norelco Tripleheader
35T against these new blades. Each shaved
one side of his face with a blade and the
other with the Tripleheader. Our three ﬂoat-
ing heads followed the curves of their faces.
And our eighteen rotary blades shaved in
every direction at once (that’s the way
beards grow).

Blades can't do all this. They’re straight.
And that's why scren out of ten men. said
the Trz‘pIclzcader shazscd them as close or
close?‘ tlzan the new blades. ‘

What’s more, the Tripleheader has a

»- pop-out trimmer. So you
 can get your side-
burns straight
and even for a
« change.

 Now what blade can
compete with that?

 
 
   

 This is h I

The Norelco Tripleheaders

we have against

other rechargeables. 

A rechargeable that gives up to tz0z'ce.as

many shaves per charge as any other re-

chargeable. I ,
Our Rechargeable Tripleheader 45CT has.

all the features of our regularTripleheader. ’* I

It has three i\licrogroove“‘ ﬂoating heads.  » ; ~7;«-’*~

And eighteen rotary blades that continu-y
ously sharpen themselves to cut down on“_ “
bothersome blade replacement. And a hid.- 9

den pop-up trimmer for neat sideburns and
mustaches.

It also has some special features all its
own. A Shave Counter that automatically
counts your shaves and tells you when.t0

recharge. A Charge Indicator that lights up ‘WI   
when it’s recharging. And, of course,the — '

Rechargeable can ' 
shave with or '
without a cord.
Now what re-
chargeable can com-
pete with that?
