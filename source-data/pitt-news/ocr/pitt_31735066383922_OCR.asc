“SGB Member Resigns:
2nd In Three Months

By NANCY J. WINTNER

Student Government Board
(SGB) member JoAnn Levinson
resigned her post Wednesday in the
year’s second board resignation,
leaving only ﬁve members to handle
all board activities. The first

resignation came from Ahmie Baum 4 .

in June.
Levinson has taken a temporary
leave of absence from the

“University, and resigned in accor-

dance with the Student Govern-

JOANNE LEVINSON

ment Constitution. The bylaws
state that all board members must
be full-time students.

Levinson said she intends to
return [0 the University and may
run for re-election to the board. “I
won’t rule that out," she said, “but
it will depend on the situation."
_ resignation, Levinson said,
A  as "not meant as a reﬂection on
the board but as a consequence of
another decision.

“It was a decision I made
without regret," she added, ‘‘It
was the right thing to do.”

However, SGB President Bernie
Payne said he didn’t think either
Baum or Levinson understood the
committment and time necessary
“to act effectively as board
members.

‘‘If you can’t do it with the
interest at heart." Payne said,
“you’re better off not doing it at
all. But I am sorry to see either one
resign. We’ve lost by not having
their input; they’ve lost by not
having the experience.”

Levinson ran for student govern-
ment last January as a candidate
representing the commuter faction
of Pitt undergraduates. Levinson
said at that time that commuter
problems should be a board priority.
Her absence from the board leaves
it without an acknowledged com-
muter program champion.

Although there are only ﬁve
board members left to maintain
board activities. SGB member
Dave Hesidence does not forsee
any immedidate problems. In fact,
he said, it will be “a positive
change.”

‘‘It will be nice to get some fresh
air in student government, perhaps
younger people with- some new
ideasf’

Hesidence said the board struc-
ture sometimes lends itself to
personality conflicts and with fewer
people, there_ will be less problems.

Payne said he hopes there
someday will be a ﬁve-member
board. for the same reasons cited
by Hesidence.

The PITT NEWSwill carry an ad
next week for those students
interested in applying for the two
vacant positions. The “Search
Committee,” comprised of board
members and students from other
organizations will seek out students
with a “sincere desire to serve the
student body,” Payne said.

Applications will be due at the
end of September.

appropriation table, page 2.

The University of Pittsburgh
continues to forfeit $2,000 per day
in interest revenue because of cash
flow lost to a delayed state
appropriation, a figure that will
increase to $3,000 per day in
October. according to Chancellor
Posvar.

Leadership in the legislature has
assured the affected schools they
will attempt to increase “non-pre-

ferred” appropriation to replace _

the forfeited funds, Posvar said.
According to Posvar, a similar
situation occurred during a budget

battle in 1969, causing Pitt to miss ,

a payroll. Leadership in the
legislature promised then to
replace the forfeited funds.

However. they received no support

“We expect several weeks of
political debate,” ‘Posvar said,
“but nothing is to be gained by

“The people against education

“The attitude (inithe legislature) is

PiH's Financial Weight
Boosts Area Profits

By MARK MURPHY

Pitt graduates earned $16.7
billion more with their degrees
than they would have earned
otherwise, according to a study
released by the University this
week.

The study, conducted by Pitt’s
Office of Institutional Research,
shows the economic impact of the
University and its 108,202 alumni
on the Pittsburgh and Allegheny
County areas.

\Throughout ‘the study year
1975-76, Pitt brought $102.2
million into the local economy and
paid $99 million in salaries to its
6,650 employes. With 6,650 on its
payroll,’ the University is the
largest single employer in Pitts-
burgh.

‘‘It is generally recognized that
as an institution of national and
international prominence the Uni-

versity of Pittsburgh serves the
Commonwealth and the region in a
variety of important ways through
its programs of instruction, public
service and research,” Vice Chan-
cellor of Planning and Budget Jack
Freeman said. “What is often
overlooked, however, is the fact
that the University is a vitally
important ﬁnancial and economical
asset to the community.”

In addition to keeping a large
number of people on its own
payroll. Pitt has spent $113 million
locally for labor—enough to fund
22,600 person-years of work. The
University is scheduled to spend
$44.5 million in the future for
further construction.

The spending habits of Pitt
students also were included in the
study. Besides the $8 million
resident students paid in room and

Pitt Honors Program

By MAGGIE McKAY

Dr. Glenn A. Stewart, an
associate professor of physics at
Pitt, has been named director of
the University’s Honor Program.

The program, still in its infancy,
is expected to begin operation in
the 1978 winter term with a limited.
of honors courses in
speciﬁc fields and on interdis-
ciplinary topics. These courses will

 be open to students in all schools

and departments of the Oakland

campus.
The Honors Program stirred
controversy last year among

the student body and administra-
tors worried that such a program
would foster elitism and take
valued professors out of main-
stream University courses.

A University task force, chaired
by Associate Provost David Pow-
ers, outlined the then prospective
Honors Program and recommen-
ded prompt action to establish
honors courses, sections and
programs within the University’s
academic units.

4  The task recommended institu-
‘tion of separate UHP facilities,

which would include staff offices as
well as seminar rooms, a reading
room, a study-faculty lounge and a
computer room containing a
dial-access computer terminal for
honors student use.

A concerned‘ Student Govern-

ment Board and others registered‘

fears that separate facilities would
foster elitism among the Pitt
community. The task force report
dealt with this complaint by
stating, “We wish to avoid
separation of these honor students
from the rest of the academic

believe there is much merit in
encouraging them to spend some
time together.”

All that is currently available to
Pitt students in the way of an
honors program are courses and
seminars sponsored by individual
departments.

The Honors Program, according
to Powers and the task force, is to
be staffed and maintained‘ by
individual departments. These
departments will bear much of the
instructional costs of the honors
seminars. —

The task force also recommen-
ded last year the development of
departmental honors programs
independent of, but parallel to the
Honors Program framework.

Official admittance of students
into the Honors Program is
expected to begin in the winter
term, with a projected enrollment
of 200 students per class per year.

Currently, according to an
Honors Program spokesman, the
program is still in the planning
stages, working out faculty
participation and course structures.

Provost Rhoten Smith, announ-
cing Stewart’s appointment as
program director, said, “I believe
the University Honors Program is
one of the more significant
initiatives we have taken in recent
years.) g I have great faith in Dr.
Stewart’s ability to give structure
to the concept and obtain wide
support forthe program.”

“72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

They Took The Money
And Run

We have every reason to believe that Paul Nyden and the
University sharedfeelings of victory after last month’s out-of-court
"settlement of Nyden’s suit against Pitt. Nyden said the cash
settlement made it possible for him to continue his work for “a
considerable period of time.” The University was spared the
possibility of a long and expensive court battle.

.. '.1’*!lls‘tf'..T.-K‘-13% .1,“3W5'F""'Yv §°P‘°‘:‘¥3’$i.?.s.1977’. . 

 

Their bank accounts may have been affected favorably, but
Nyden and Pitt each lost a_ great deal when the University offered a
financial settlement and Nyden accepted. Each side proved‘ it
wasn’t so interested in principle after all, and therefore lost any
claim to those principles.

We can understand the plight of Nyden, an unemployed
instructor with a less-than-sure future. The University’s check
must have been attractive to a man in his position. But that was no
reason for Nyden, who sought publicity and support for
‘fprinciples,” to forget his battle.in the face of a blinding blur of
green, even if it was a five-figure blur.

His supporters have every right to be disillusioned and angry.
We suspect that had Nyden. said earlier that he would consider a
cash inducement to drop his fight, his supporters would have been
few and his hands would have played to even emptier lawns.

The University’s position is, if possible, more appalling. After
successfully disposing of Sharon Johnson by fighting for
“academic principles,” the University decided those principals
weren’t all that important after all, if money was involved.

We can understand the University’s desire to put the Nyden
affair, and the attendant bad publicity, behind it as it forges into a
new school year. But that does not excuse its decision to settle the
Nyden issue with cash and allow the moral issue to remain hanging

The University’s position is abhorrent no matter what the facts
of Nyden’s situation. If Nyden was competent, and his dismissal
the product of political disagreement, the only fair remedy was the
offering of a contract that would have allowed Nyden a fair chance
of receiving tenure.

Either way, the University’s behavior is as abominable as that of
Nyden. The fact they would not make public the price they paid
for principle makes it worse. Now that each has abandoned
principle for money, any future claims of academic righteousness
will be, at best, suspect. '

The Meek Shall
Inherit Appropriations

Anyone following the University’s campaign to win legislative
approval of non—preferred appropriation has noticed a remarkable
docility in Pitt’s actions and statements. Since there exists some
chance an over-aggressive fight could lead to its being thrown into a

‘red-ink sea, Pitt has been eager not to rock the boat.

Non-preferred appropriations require a two-thirds vote for
passage. That figure is formidable,’ especially when it is
remembered that the general appropriations package passed by
bare majorities. But no matter how formidable the task may seem,
winning state funding of the no-n-preferreds is necessary if higher
education in Pennsylvania is to survive. I "

The penalty for fighting incorrectly will be severe, making it
imperative that students not jeopardize Pitt’s chances by alienating
lawmakers. ~

Tactlcs Such as those emP10Yed by the Student Coalition Against
two years ago could leave Pitt without the votes it needs.

The correct way to ensure state funding is simple: impress Pitt’s
importance to the students and economy of ‘the city, region and
state it serves in a mature and responsible manner.

Students and other University supporters are sure to find that
legislative votes will be won through employment of tact and fact,
rather than harassment and misdirected pressure.

SGB Programming Move Ripped

For those of you who haven’t
noticed yet, at a meeting 0f the
Student Government Board last
month it was pronounced that Pitt
Programming Committee should be
dissolved. The board announced
that it will be replaced by another
committee which will buy blocks of
tickets from the big concert
producers within the city. What this
means to students is that they will
no longer be afforded the pleasure
of an intimate evening in the lower
lounge with a Tom Waits or a John
Hartford but can attend B.T.O.
concerts along with 20,000 other
screaming teenie-boppers in the
Civic Arena.‘

The decision of the board was
based on the Programming
Committee’s ﬁeld record fromthe
previous year as well as the
“inaccessibility” of committee
members over the summer months;
however, the Board failed to defend
their own inability to attain a

-quorum at the very meeting that

this ironic criticism was put forth.

Another transparent ploy directed
at reducing the committee’s
credibility was that they had had
“no feedback” from any of the
Committees’ members on how to

’ realign its structure. This puzzled

me terribly, especially since 10 days
prior to this meeting I had met with
one of the board members and
expressed at that time a willingness
to restructure the committee. I also
conveyed the need to be advised of
the boards priorities on this
subject before devising a new
format. No one ever got back to me.

and cutbacks in faculty and

budget, approved in August,
provides for absolutly no state
funding for the state related
universities, including Pitt. Ad-
ministration officials have noted
that Pitt will soon be forced to
begin borrowing money, just to
meet its minimum monthly ex-

penses.
the record of the past several

yearly fugding battles shows the
absolute failure of the strategy
advocated by Chancellor Posvar,

and echoed by many student’

government leaders. Their policy
has been to avoid demonstrations
and protests in order not to
“offend” our state budget cutters.

Quiet lobbying and attempts to
gain the ear of “friendly”
politicians have been the favored
tactics. Yet. year after year, Pitt’s

The Pennsylvania state

funding proposals have b ‘:
slashed by the Republicans and t e
Democrats. This year, the failure
of Posvar’s politics-as-usual strate-
gy is total.

What is needed is a campaign
that puts demonstrations and
protests, which rely on the
mobilization of thousands of
affected students, faculty and staff,
at the heart of its strategy.
Whatever the politicians may say
about such demonstrations, their
actions have clearly shown that
they understand‘ and fear such
-language. Pitt student government
leaders are in an excellent position
to initiate such a strategy. They
could approach interested
groups, unions and other or
tions at the various schools, asking
them to attend an open meeting to
plan a mass response to the
forthcoming cutbacks.

By DAN MULHOLLAND

This article is about the
American canal in Panama and the
treaty proposed by the Carter
Administration, which will sur-
render that canal to potentially
hostile foreign powers. It is not a
jingoistic article, as some might
expect. invoking the name of Teddy
Roosevelt and rattling the prover-
bial sabre. Nor is it a clarion call
for all red-blooded Americans to
take up arms and march across the
Rio Grande. Rather, it attempts to
present some crucial facts which
have been largely ignored by the

news media in the hope that the"

reader will be able to make an
informed decision on this important
issue of public policy.

First and foremost, the Panama
Canal is our canal. We did not
steal the land from Panama, nor
did we extort it. On the contrary,
the government of Panama freely

_ceded the territory now known as

the Canal Zone to the United States
in perpetuity. This has been
interpreted by the Supreme Court
to mean that our country can
exercise full sovereign rights over
the territory. To put it simply, the
Canal Zone isjust as much as a part
of'America as Pittsburgh, New
York or Plains. And since it is
American soil, the House of
Representatives, as well as the
Senate. must approve its disposi-
tion according to Article IV, Section
3 of the Constitution.

Second, the Canal has not lost its
military or economic signiﬁcance.
Although some of our larger
aircraft carriers cannot fit through
its lock system, the majority of
military and cargo vessels can.
Should this country surrender

control of the canal, it would face a
two-pronged problem in the event
of war. On one hand, there would
be no guarantee that our ships
would be able to use the canal; on
the other hand, the Panamanians
may allow enemy ships

«possibility of setting up a Soviet,

base at the Vacamonte harbor.
Panama is virtually bankrupt, and
it does not take much imagination
to see that such enticements will
only draw her further into the Red
vortex. \
There is another story connected
with this bankruptcy, one that has
far more sinister implications. It is
connected with the dealings of S01
Linowitz, one of two chief U.S.
negotiators of the new canal treaty.
Linowitz, a registered foreign
agent for the Marxist government
of Chilean Salvador Allende, in
-1973 a registered foreign agent of
Columbia, one of Panama’s im-
mediate neighbors as late as Feb. 1
of this year, was also, even as
negotiations began, a member of
the board of directors of Marine
Midland Bank. It is a well-docu-
mented fact that the country of
Panama has borrowed large sums
of money from that institution, with '
most of the debts still outstanding.
There is more than a little
speculation on Capitol Hill that one
of the main reasons the Adminis-
tration is pushing so hard for the
surrender of the canal is so Torrijos
will have some additional assets
and revenue to pay back the almost
$200 million he owes international
banking interests in the U.S. and
Europe. Other men have gone to‘
jail for conﬂicts of interest far less
innocuous than Linowitz’s, but he
still continues to hold an inﬂuential
position in our government.

There are many other reasons
the proposed canal treaty should be
rejected by the House and Senate,
not the least of which are
American pride and integrity. To
do justice to all of them would take

an entire volume. Nevertheless, it '

is my hope that this column has
promoted a few thinking indivi-
duals to stand up and be counted

_ among those who will not tolerate

this blatant sellout of our national
honor.

Section 438 of the General
Education Provision Act, as a-
mended by Section 513 of Public
Law 93-380 and Section 2 of Public
Law 93-568, referred to as the
“Privacy Rights of Parents and
Students,” (more commonly called
the “Buckley Amendment”) re-
quires that the University of
Pittsburgh give public notice to
parents and students of the
following information.

The Buckley Amendment is
designed to protect the privacy of
students. In order to do so, these
provisions are binding on the
University of Pittsburgh:

1. Individual student records
should include only information
necessary and relevant to the
educational purposes of the institu-
tion.

2. Student records are open for
inspection by students or their
pa.ents upon request, with the
exception that letters of recom-
mendation written prior to Jan. 1,
1975 remain conﬁdential. Addi-
tionally, speciﬁc documents that
students have waived their right to
inspect remain conﬁdential.

PUBLIC NOTICE TO STUDENTS

3. Students have a right to
challenge the accuracy of records.

4. The institution may not
release student records outside the
institution without student consent,
unless one of several exceptions
applies.

5. Requests external to the
institution for information regard-
ing students should be document-
ed, as should releases of student
information.

6. The University may establish
categories of information known as
“Directory Information” and re-
lease this information upon request
by individuals external to the
institution. This may be done only
after students are provided the
opportunity to request exclusion
from the “Directory.” .

Greater specificity and further
information regarding exceptions
may be obtained in Room 104,
Schenley Hall. Students also may
request information from the office
regarding the types of records
maintained, the custodian of
records and the location of the
office where records are main-
tained.

itt’s First Week:Traffic J ams & Handshakesg

By RICH HARRY

Pitt opened its doors this week to
more than 29,000 students return-
ing to Oakland for another year of
academics. V

Ushered by trafﬁc jams in the
Schenley Quadrangle and on
Forbes and Fifth Avenues, stu-
dents swarmed the campus Sun-
day, the ﬁrst day dormitories
officially opened for resident
students.

By Wednesday, most students
were settled in their new surround-
ings, apparently looking forward to
spending the next several months
at Pitt—the prospect of textbook
prices, homework and ﬁnal exams
notwithstanding. “I, came t0

learn,” said one student, “but
admit it, Pitt is a party school.”
Among the returnees are an
estimated 2,500 freshmen, the
largest ﬁrst-year class in the
University's 190-year history.

Attracted in large measure by
free lunch and entertainment,
several hundred freshmen Tuesday
were individually introduced for a
mutual look-see with Chancellor
Wesley Posvar, his wife ‘Mildred,
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs
Alfred Moye and Student Govern-
ment president Bernie Payne.

The foursome shook hands and
talked casually‘ for almost two
hours with_th‘e undetermined—but
large—number. of students who

White Water Rafting:

Racing the Rapids  

By JOHN FINN

Like hula hoops, poodle skirts,
duck tails and Beatlemania, white
water rafting is one of the newest
and most exciting fads to sweep the
country and this area in recent
years.

White water rafting, or riding
the rapids, is not new; people have
been rafting for as long as there

Rec Room
Gets New

Toys , Prices

By KEITH BRIAN

Summer has signaled the advent
of some changes in the recreation
and cafeteria rooms of Schenley
Hall. The basic change is in the
prices. From the doughy hoagies to
the ping--pong ball, costs have
equally compounded and com-
plexed returning students.

Hoagies are no longer sold via
linear measurement. Last year they ~
were sold 20 cents an inch, cut from
a bulky yard—long submarine.
This year, pre——bagged eight——inch
sandwiches go for 99 cents.

(Continued on Page 10)

have been rapids. But rafting has
gained overwhelming popularity,
especially in the Western Penn-
sylvania area, during the past’
several years due to the emergence
of tour groups.

Until recently, many people
avoided riding the rapids because
of an inﬂux of stories about people
who fell out of the raft and were
swept down the river, never to be
seen again.

However, tour groups such as
White Water Adventures and
Voyagers provide guides and
sponsors two 11-miletrips daily
down the Youghiogheny River in
Ohiopyle State Park. A

The tour, which costs $20.00 to
$25.00 per person, includes a
lunch, a raft, lifejackets, paddles
and four guides—two in a raft and
two in kayaks.

An orientation session precedes
the trip; one of the guides gives
instructions as to the proper use of
equipment, how to ride the rapids,
how to get off a‘rock if .you get
caught and how to aviod danger.
The guide’s main objective is to put

to rest some of the novice rider's

unfounded fears.

The six-hour tour begins inno-
cently enough in a calm, quiet
portion of the river and ends under
a railroad bridge.

In the meantime, one can expect
sore muscles. sunburned faces and
gallons and gallons of water inside
the raft.

lined the Cathedral lawn for the
reception.

While admitting that he was

beginning to feel the effects of
repeated handshaking, Moye said
he was “enjoying every minute of
it.”
A “lt’s more than worthwhile to be
out here meeting the freshmen,”
he said. “There aren’t too many
chances they have for meeting the
Chancellor. We don’t begrudge
them at all.”

Although impressed with the
reception, a few students seemed
more concerned about the awaiting
food and tomorrow’s football
opener against Notre Dame.

“We’re deﬁnitely going to beat
Notre Dame,” freshman Florence

Hunter said without predicting the
game’s ﬁnal score. ‘‘I’m telling
everyone back home (near Erie)
that we’re going to do it.”

Even before tomorrow’s contest,
students began to enjoy their stay
here. All week, under blue skies.
they emerged from the concrete
and brick dormitories for the
greener parts of campus. The
Cathedral lawn and Schenley Park
attracted large numbers of stu-
dents. .

And at night, they gathered in
the Quad and outside the Towers to
renew old friendships or to forge
new ones. Oakland night life
awakened after a relatively’ quiet

summer.
But problems ‘such as coping

with a new roommate or an
uncomprehensible professor, in
addition to the perennial dilemma
of exhaustingly long lines, also
were part of the introduction to
Pitt.

“The only good line is a chorus
line,” one student said.
P But engineering student Chuck
Waskiewicz found no problem in
checking out his textbooks in the
bookstore. breezing through the
line in “only ﬁve mi_nutes.”

Waskiewicz explained:
General Studies students have

classes at night and the Towers’
students have indigestion.”

  Gershwin Music Alive On Pitt Stage

By TOBI ROSEN

“I like New York. in June, how
about you?”—Cole Porter
This weekend, 47 Gershwin tunes
return to the Stephen Foster
Memorial in “An Evening with
George and Ira.” Directed and
conceived by Associate Theatre
Professor Henry Heymann, “An
Evening.’ ’ includes such memorable
hits as “Summertime” and “Shall
W e D ance . ’ ’

The musical revue format is
usually reserved for the comfortable
surroundings of dinner theatres.

One sits back, enjoys a meal and
listens to the music.

But in recent years, the musical
revue has graduated to the
legitimate stage. The smash hit
“Side by Side by “Sondheim” is a
current Broadway sellout. And the
haunting melodies of ‘ ‘Jacques Brel
is Alive and Well and Living in
Paris” still play the cabarets. Will
the Gershwin brothers prove to be a
dynamic duo to Pitt students?
Director Heymann said he is not
aiming exclusively for a Pitt
audience, citing the music’s
universal appeal.

The Gershwins wrote won-
derfully literate music. People just
haven’t gotten tired of them.

“We’re presenting their songs
not as a piece of nostalgia, but

simply as excellent music,” Hey-
mann continued.

“An Evening” is more than just
an extended medley. To complete-
ment the songs Heymann added
narration and slides that pun the
Gershwin mores from 1917 to 1934.
The numbers are structured
chronologically; a natural shift from
theatre to ﬁlm occurs about 1930.

‘Rose Garden’

By PATTY TASCARELLA

I Never Promised You A Rose
Garden
Directed by Roger Corman

Hannah Green’s widely ac-
claimed novel about a schizo-
and her gradual
recovery has ﬁnally made it to the
screen after nearly ten years of
legal hassles. The ﬁlm, “I Never
Promised You A Rose Garden,” is
both better and worse than Green’s
book.

“Rose Garden” starts off with
Deborah Blake’s (Kathleen Quin-
lan) arrival at a mental institution.
Left in the care of Dr. Fried (Bibi
Anderssen) she eventually begins
to make contact with the outside
world.

The problem is that Deborah is
caught between the fantasy king-
dom of Yr and reality. She is the
only one who knows of Yr, with its
secret language and brutal cere-
monies, and she is warned
repeatedly by Yrian warriors not to
betray them. At ﬁrst, their. grasp is
too strong and Deborah, who is

convinced she cannot feel physical ~

pain, she repeatedly attempts
suicide. Later, by learning to trust
Fried,,she is able to make the break
‘and, the ﬁlm’s end, is preparing to
leave the institution.

Just Doesn’t Have It

Quinlan is excellent as Deborah.
Although a former model, she looks
like an appropriately plain and
frumpy product of the ’50s and her
performance is sincere, believable
and understated. As the psychia-
trist, Anderssen matches Quinlan’s
characterization. Fried isn’t
overplayed for a minute; she is
always calm, warm and realistic.

Sylvia Sydney and Susan Tyrrell
shine in bit parts as asylum
inmates. Tyrrell is an obesehulk of
nymphomaniacal fervor who alter-
nately screams rape and tries to
seduce orderlies. Sydney is an
in-and-out patient, an eldrly school
teacher who appears to be totally
sane until she hurls an iron cot
against the door at the staff.

Where the ﬁlm fails is with
Director Roger Corman’s concep-
tion of Yr. Unlike Green’s book,
Corman presents Yr as a sort of
primitive, pagan society, thus
making it difficult to accept
Deborah’s devotion to it.

Comparisons with “One Flew
Over The Cuckoo’s Nest” are

.inevitable but unfounded. Where

“Cuckoo’s Nest” dealt with a sane
person against the Establishment,
“Rose Garden" is told from the
schizophrenic’s point of view.
Deborah’s battle for sanity is
neither charming nor witty—it is
painful, .slow and sometimes
brutal—but it is always real.

‘Greased Lightning: ’

Big Disappointment

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Greased Lightning
Directed by Michael Schultz

How could a ﬁlm starring comic
Richard Pryor‘ and scripted by
Melvin Van Peebles (Don’t Bother
Me, I Can’t Cope”) flop? In the
case of “Greased Lightning”-—
very easily.

“Greased Lightning” is based
on the true-life adventures of
Wendell Scott (Pryor), the first
black racing car driver, from his

early days as a moonshine runner
in a stereotypic redneck Southern
town to his rise to the top of his
profession.

Most ﬁlm biographies, particu.
larly when the subject is still living,
tend to be maudlin and this is no
exception. The dialogue is stilted
and the black-white relations are
typical Hollywood. With all this
against it, it is difﬁcult to gauge the
depth of anyone’s performance; the
script ruins them two minutes into
the picture.

“Washington: Behind Closed

drama being aired this week by
ABC. The series concerns the
ﬁctional presidency of Richard M.

plexes.

nights) depicted Monckton’s rise to

in the Oval Ofﬁce are spent
secretely escalating a southeast
Asian war while despatching
henchmen to collect and create
“facts” damaging to White House
“enemies.”

Also introduced are the Presi-
dent's aides, captained by right-
hand man Frank Flaherty (Robert
Vaughn), a Haldeman-Ehrlichman
ﬁgure who is Nazi-like in his tactics
and appetite for power. Other
aides, some which the cameras
follow home, are too deluded and
ambitious to set personal values
over a desire to succeed as
President's men.

“Actually, it’s an appreciation

Heymann said. “But it’s a lot of
fun. People come out of the theatre
bubbling.”

Performers Marilyn McWilliams,
Mary Robb Jackson, Sandy Rein-

The shifting emphasis from
character. to character. from plot to
related plot and from scene to
scene impress upon the viewer a
sense of complexity and vastness
that sits well with America's
conception of Washington.

The story never dulls or sags:
when one action is completed on
one stage we are instantly taken to
new action on another. The
intergrated story lines constantly
unfold like the colors in a
kaleidoscope; we are given no
opportunities to grow bored.

The early episodes .showed
impressive portrayals of how power
and its attendants (glamour and
prestige) can lure persons away
from their humanity. This is shown

vividly in the continuing story of
one frightened, naive aide who is
gradually becoming callous to all
concerns save the possibilities of
i'moving up” in the administrative

hierarchy. '

Monckton is power-thirsty be-
cause he feels powerless, while

Flaherty is the real villain, with an .

intense and religious orientation to
power.

Americans to acquaint themselves

with a government peopled by real
men. not by cardboard do-gooders
who win elections. Fiction is often
obliged to exaggerate truths, if
only to give them proper visibility.

If the program falls short at all, it
is because it is being aired in 1977
instead of 1967. Monckton is a

-brilliantly complex, true-to-life

character. However, he is just the

sum total of what we have

Tlie Pittsburgh Symphony
opens its 51st season tonight, with
maestro Andre Previn at the helm.
After his successful debut last year
as the symphony’s music director,
Previn has invigorated “the Pitts-
burgh" with a few choice contracts
made to keep our symphony’s
name from reaching that great
symphony graveyard somewhere in
the suburbs of Oshkosh, Wiscon-
sin.

Among the deals: recording two
new albums with Angel and
Columbia, due sometime this fall;
the television series “Previn and

the Pittsburgh,” which was broad-
cast from coast to coast on PBS; the
entire subscription series, which
includes Thursday with the Friday,
Saturday and Sunday concerts, is
sold out and next spring, the
symphony will embark on its
second European tour in its 50 year
history——the first tour since 1964.
Previn, casually dressed, spoke to
reporters about the upcoming
season yesterday at Heinz Hall.

Previn characterized the music in
his first season here as conserva-
tive, and this season’s music as
more adventurous. “I neither try
to woo nor antagonize an audience.

Previn believes this year’s Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra muscians are of

the highest quality, assuring that

MOSTEI. DEAD AT 62

PHILADELPHIA (AP)-Veteran
stage and screen actor Zero Mostel
died yesterday at Jefferson Hos-
pital here, officials of the Forrest
Theater said. He was 62.

Mostel, known for his stage
performances in “Fiddler on the.
Roof.” was in Philadelphia for a
production of “The Merchant” but
had missed several performances
this week because of illness.

‘Coma’ Needs To Be
More Believable

By MARIA SCIULLO

Susan Wheeler hardly ﬁts
anyone's stereotype of a‘ female

third-year medical student. The
heroine of Robin Cook’s latest
novel, “Co-ma,” has all the

necessary brains and dedication for
success A at .Boston’s famed Me-
morial Hospital, as well as the looks

of a: fashion model.

Upon her arrival at Memorial,
Wheeler discovers that ‘ ‘something
is very wrong.”- It seems that 12
patients admitted to the hospital for
minor surgery the past year have
inexplicably lapsed into comas.
Worse yet, one very recent victim
was a personal friend of Susan’s.

Deciding to investigate, Susan is
opposed by numberous staff
administrators and hospital per-
sonnel. By this time, she ﬁnds that
she may have stumbled onto
something that could endanger hr
own life. 1’

"‘ “rm

-so

“Coma” is full of medical jargon
which the average reader can easily
skip over. Cook. a clinical instructor
at Harvard Medical School, pro-
vides a technically correct setting,
-but the plot tends toward the
unbelievable.

Where, for example, are the
comatose patients’ families

have the expertise to form an
accurate theory about the comas at
the end of her first day on the job?
How can she possibly solve the
mystery in a mere four days? Why
the uncertain ending?

The plot is believable enough but
Cook’s characterizations are not.

Soon to be a ﬁlm starring
Jacqueline Bissett as Susan,
“Coma” is a modem-day horror
story with enough excitement to
make up for the inconsistencies in

. plot.

ByJIMLEWIS

It’s come to a point where there’s
nothing left to say. Predictions have
been made, names have been
dropped and bets have been laid.

i All that’s left is the game itself——the

climactic confrontation between two
of the nation's college football
powerhouse, the Fighting Irish of
Notre Dame and the Pitt Panthers.

At Tuesday’s press luncheon,

. Irish coach Dan Devine and Panther

skipper Jackie Sherrill revealed
some fresh news‘, but basically gave -
typical cat-and-mouse statements
to merely whet the football world’s

appetite.

Devine was the most cautious,
downplaying his team’s number
one pre-season ranking and hoping
to calm Pitt’s lust for an important
victory.

"“We have only three seniors
starting on both offense and
defense,” he said. “We lost six
starters on offense—(split end) Dan
Kelleher, (quarterback) Rick

‘:2: 1li,qc:re.*.:»'rttrr“r1*rrNnws:1$tia§ty,  9, isiiirii ” '

Devine, Sherrill Remain Cautio

Slager, (offensive tackle Harry
Woebkenberg, (halfback) Al
Hunter, (halfback) Steve Dover,
(fullback) Jerome Heavens—and
we were picked number one (in the
pre-season polls) before we lost
these people. We are really a rather
inexperienced team.”

But Sherrill refuted Devine’s
view of Notre Dame, hinting that
the Irish coach told only half the
story.

“Notre Dame is experienced,”
Sherrill disagreed. “They can
play——they have experience in that
lineup. They deserve to be picked
as the pre-season number one
team.”

Devine did reveal that Rusty
Lisch will start at quarterback ahead
of Monor_lgahala’s Joe Montana,
and showed concern over last year's
defensive play (the Irish gave up
106 points in their last ﬁve regular
season games. But on the whole, he
was cautious and levelheaded.

Sherrill kept to things he had
been saying all alone—that Pitt has

 

a lot of talent, potential, and
excitement. And that as far as
predictions go, he couldn't say.
“We have 13 freshmen on our
traveling squad this year, ’ ’ he said.
“We will have a good football
team, but we don’t have a lot of
experience. ’ ’

Sherrill conﬁrmed that Hubert
Green, the 6-2, 210-pound
freshman defensive end, will start
despite limited practice time and
that, for the most part, the offense
will operate out of the information.
Wide receiver Gordon Jones (“he
had the best training camp of his
career”) and center Walt Brown
(“he gets that football back there
will”) were lauded, but the only
startling piece of news by the
Panthers was that sophomore
halfback Larry Sims, due to his
impressive training camp per-
formance, won a starting spot
opposite Elliot Walker in Pitt’s
promising backﬁeld.

But it was an edgy luncheon, as if
everyone present knew that it was
only the beginning of the truly
grand explosion of strength and
ability that will occur Saturday
afternoon in front of a national
television audience. There was
really no sense in delving much
deeper or stiring up anyone’s
determination—a1l that will happen
in the football game, after names
have been dropped, bets have been
laid and everything has been said.

Chesle y Back at Backer

By KAREN KADILAK

Last spring, Pitt football player
Al Chesley was in a far more crucial
situation than he could ever face in
the course of a football game.

That explains why, even in this
tense week leading to the show-
down between the Panthers and
Notre Dame, the junior linebacker
has something else on his mind

- besides the game.

No matter how hard he tries to
forget the drug possession charge
levied against him in May,
Chesley, completely cleared of
criminal charges by both city and
University judicial boards, can’t
getthe incident off his mind.

.'‘‘I think about it a lot,” Chesley
said. “I probably think about it
more than} should. I’ll never be

able to forget it. I think it was an _

incident that never should have
happened. But it did and I’ve

‘ .‘learned.from it.‘ There's not that.

’_much I can say, but that—it’s behind
me and I’m glad it’s over. I'm just

, looking forward to a good season.”

. time,” Sherrill’ continued.

Unfortunately for the outgoing
junior, there are more than a few
people who don’t think Chesley
should be playing football, a point
with which both Pitt head coach
Jackie Sherrill and linebacker
coach Foge Fazio disagree.

“He never was a bad character, ”
Sherril pointed out. “Sometimes a
young man makes a mistake, but so
have a lot of people in our country.
If somebody stands up and Says
‘l’ve never made a mistake’ and
tells you that you yourself never
made a mistake, you know they’re
wrong-. ’

“You just hope that you don’t
make the mistake at the wrong
“Al’s
given a lot of himself.to improve. I
think he’s been a better person
because of it.” A

“Chesley’s attitude has been
excellent,” Fazio added. “He’s
primarily kept-.. himself busy with

football. We’ve‘ talked to* him,
about not being preoccupied with ‘

what’s going. to"-happen in this
situation. He’s going to expect

  Parker Blast Deckscards;
Bucs still Six Games Back

Parker rapped a two-run homer
off relief pitcher Al Brabosky to give
the Pittsburgh Pirates a 9-5 victory
over the Cards Thursday night.

‘The victory kept the Pirates six
games back of the Philadelphia
Phillies in the National League
East.

Parker's homer, his 19th of the
season, came in the seventh when
the Pirates scored four times to
erase a 5-4 Cardinal lead.
Pittsburgh scored another run in the
eighth on Frank Taveras’ RBI
single.

With one out in the seventh

Miguel Dilone walked off Buddy
Schultz and stole second. He scored

one out later when Phil Garner
doubled off Rawley Eastwick.
Brabosky relieved Eastwick, and
Parker smacked his two—run homer.
Then Bill Robinson walked, stole
second, and scored on Al Oliver's
single.
Eastwick fell to 5-3 with the loss.
Pirate reliever LarryDemery climbe
The Cardinals led 5-1 through 4%

some adverse publicity when his
name comes up. They’re going to
mention incidents outside of
football and I know it’s going to
hurt him.”

The incident certainly hasn’t
affected Chesley’s performance on
the football ﬁeld. Rankedias low as
ﬁfth-string linebacker on the depth
chart during the early portion of fall
camp, Chesley has earned a
starting berth for tomorrow’s
game.

Starter or no starter, Chesley
doesn’t feel he has anything to
prove.

“I’m just concentrating on Notre
Dame,” Chesley said. “I don’t
have anything to prove on the ﬁeld.

Off the ﬁeld, I don’t really have to
prove anything either. It was a

freak accident that could happen to
anyone. Still,.I’ll never be able to
forget it.”

After an impressive training camp, sophomore Larry Sims earned a starting’ A

Boaters Hope to Zap
Zips in Season Opener

By JIM LEWIS

‘The Pitt soccer team has all the
ingredients for a successful sea-
son—-—ﬁne recruitment, proven vet-
erans, tough schedule—but hopes
for a winning year are cloudy due to
its annually-sputtering offense.

“We had to play defense many
times last year,” head coach Leo
Bemis explained, ” because we
didn’t have much of an attack.”

Practically none; the Panthers
averaged less than one goal a
game. but still managed to close
with a 4-7-2 campaign. But going
into tomorrow’s contest against the
powerful Akron Zips in Ohio, Pitt’s
punchless reputation may come to
an end. '

Midwest?

Bemis will throw his best against

Cowboys’ Staubach Slaps Steelers, 30-0

Roger Staubach slapped life into
a sluggish Dallas offense and Effren
Herrera drilled three long-distance
field goals Thursday night to propel
the Dallas Cowboys to a 30-0
National Football League preseason
victory over a lifeless Pittsburgh
Steelers team.

Both teams ended the exhibition
season with 3-3 records and their

Staubach, who had missed the last

Steelers placed 14-year veteran '

Bobby Walden on waivers earlier in
the week.

Roy Gerela, the Steeler place-
kicker, took over the punting chores
and wobbled efforts of 10 and ﬁve
yards to hand Dallas 10 more points.

Herrera, who had kicked a
47-yard ﬁeld goal early in the third
period, nailed a 35-yarder after
Gerela’s shank of a punt. Then
second-string Cowboy quarterback
Danny White winged a 21-yard
touchdown pass to Butch Johnson
after Gerela authorized a ﬁve-yard
effort.

Dallas came into the game off an

embarrassing 23-14 loss to Houston
last week in which the Oilers
rambled for 250 yards through the
Cowboy defense on the ground.
This prompted an angry Coach Tom
Landry to lash out at the team in
Monday meeting.

The Cowboys held All-Pro Steeler
running back Franco Harris to 43

delight of a crowd of 49,824 in a
