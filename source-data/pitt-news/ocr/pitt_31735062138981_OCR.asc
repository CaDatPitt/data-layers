SENATE ELECTION HELD '

In a spirited election held after
Economics Assembly Wednesday
morning, I." C. George was elected
sophomore senator and C. P. Powell
was elected junior senator.

Booth Bannister was elected fresh-
man senat0r‘pi_n the School of Mines
Wednesday.

Dr." Francis Newton Thorpe, pro-
fessor of political science in'the Uni-
versity, is in favor of the adoption of
the ‘honor system at Pitt. He is of
the opinion that it is the only proper’
manner, in which toconduct examina-
tions. He says that the man that has
reached the university stage ought to
be treated as “a‘gentleman, and that
the methods of the kindergarten and
the grade schools should be put aside.

the men that are in,charge of the
campaign in the behalf of the honor
system report that they have been
hard at work duringlthe last week
and that they will soon be ready to
submit the question ‘to the vote of the
"students of He University. If, when
the vote is taken, it is found that the
students are in favor of having the

_ system put in operation at Pitt, steps

STUDENTS MAKE  
I . RAID ON cups

The individual drinking cup venders
recently placed in Thaw and State
halls served the purpose well until
Tuesday ,when some inquisitivelstu-
dents discovered the secret of the
mechanism and as a result free drink-
ing cups were distributed.

‘The idea of the trustees in placing

 

i the individual cups in the buildings is

a good one from the standpoint of
sanitation, but the students feel that
the old common drinking -cup should
be in use also for those who desire to
us it, instead of being compelled to

, drop a penny in the slot every time

they wish to quench their thirst.‘The
company that placed the venders‘ in
the buildings is up in arms over the
bad usage the machines have received
at the hands of" the students and in-
quiries are being made to ‘ascertain
the miscreants. P

Mr. Prestin bf the Armstrong Cork

Wednesday morning Qn the subject,
“Heat Insulation.” He summed up
the requirements of insulating mate-

economical requirements. Several pic-
tures were then (thrown on the screen
illustrating the ‘many uses of cork as
an_ insulation against heat.

AT .THE THEATERS

 

The Lyceum Next Week
Lovers of the romantic and emo-

tional are' promised satisfying diver— .

sion in “One Day,” which comes to

the Lyceum Theater next week; It is, _

a dramatization of Elinor Glyn’s well-

known novel bf the same_narne. The H.
stage versio1i_was made by Miss Cecil I "

Spooner and produced by her orig-
inally_ in New York. An excellent
company and elaborate scenic effects

are said to characterize the perform- ’

ance. “One Day’ ’is purely -a love
story and deals in the main with inci-
dents that follow‘the ﬁrst meeting of
a young ‘Nestern girl and the youth-
ful crown prince of Sardalia on board
an ocean liner.

The Duquesne Next Week _ .
Ernest Denny’s Irish comedy, “All-
of-a-Sudden-Peggy” (Henrietta Cros-
man's big succe'ss),’will be the offer-

ing of the Davis stock players in.the I

Duquesne nextfweek. , J
The heroine of “Al1-of—a~Sudden-

Peggy” is an irresponsible ‘but good- A‘
.hearted Irish lass, whose habit of

blurting out everything that comes

E into mind involves her in one trouble

after another, and incidentally fur-
nishes three acts_ of genuine Gaelic
fun. .-I—_Ier “breaks” before members of
the nobility, with whom she is thrown
into -contact, are ludicrous, to say the
least, and lceep the audience in a‘ per-
petual state of merriment.

‘ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE

‘ That the department of journalism
‘in the University is wide awa_ke is
evident by the fact that this depart-
ment has arranged for something ab-
sohitely unique in the history of _the
University.‘ Monday evening of next’
week there will be a journalistic round
table conference held in Thaw‘Hall.
The director of journalism at the
Ohio State University, together with
some of the leading newspaper men
of this city, will discuss problems of
vital importance in the ‘_ newspaper
world before the inembers of the

' classes in journalism and their friends.

There is no doubt that this confer-
ence will be a great beneﬁt to all that
attend. Men that have made good in
"the profession of journalism willibring
messages along their special line_ of
work, ‘and the student that .listens at-
Otentively will pick up many “tips” that
will comein handy when heistarts
out on his career in newspaperdom.
The-department of journalism aims
to0mak'e'the course atithe University-
as practical as possible and by lec-
tures -by various newspa-‘per men from

. tim€ to time an-d by visits to plantts

of large dailies, where theistudents

. may get ‘a glimpseof the inside work-

ings of these great concerns, and by
actual work on the papers of_the city,
as far as it is possible to arrange for
the members of the classes to do such
work, the purpose of the department
is fulﬁlled. ' 3 '
‘THE PITT WEEKLY congratu-
lates the department on its display of

' initiative" in bringing the round table

conference to the University.

 

A Goon PLACE To‘ START

Now that the honor system is being
discussed more or less by every mem-
ber of the student: body, and while
the virtues and defects of this sys-
tem are being thrashed out before
putting the matter to the vote of the
students, it might be well to.suggest
aﬁgood place tobegin to train for this
system and_how to d'evelop'honor-
able traits of character. A

It is a fact generally admitted that

atbtoo many colleges and universities --

in the country politics play a too
prominent part in the election of men’
to ‘positions in student activities. It
is to be regretted that Pitt comes «un-
der this list of universities. We are
-not -particularly proud of the fact and
yet there is no very substantial effoft
being madeito betterthe Ktondition of
-things. It is only fair to say that as
long as the old’ system is permitted
to hold sway that every-clique. has
the right to play the game to the.
limit. ' Butcannot there be some sys-
tem devised ‘whereby men are elected
to oﬂiceon -merit and not on “pull,”
whereby :1 good man may have the

Dear Sir:—In the gym there are

stead (if being ‘fought by half of the.
students because lie‘belongs to an-
other clique? I L .

‘Last year  PI’I‘T WEEKLY’
adopted the plan ofelecting men‘ to
positions on the staff that had shown
the ability to._ handle the work. The
question of fraternities is never taken

into consideration in the selection of‘

the men, It inakes no difference to
what fraternity the man belongyor
whether he be a fraternity ‘man, so
long as he is able to show that he is
the man for thejob ,he°gets the posi-
tion. The work of the men trying
for positions onlthe staff,was judged
by'disinterested parties. ‘

Why not try to work out a system
in all lines of student activities that
will do away with the old political
game that is being played at the pres-
ent time ‘

5. Elect a cheerleader at large and

Members of the Senat‘e and the stu-
dent body at large seem to be sadly
at sga in regard to thewrnanner in
which they prefer to have used in the
coming election. _ The Senate has de-
cided to give all the above methods a
hearing on Saturday and then to de-
cide which one they will adopt.

’ The date when all nominations for
cheerleader must be handed in to
some member ofthe Senate has been
set for February 4, giving one week
longer in which the students may
think over. the niatter and send in the
names of‘ men that they think are best
qualiﬁed for the position. The chair-
man of the Student Senate has sug-

gested that any member of the stu-

dent body who wishes to express his
views ‘on the subject should write to
the editor of TI-IE~PITT VVEEKLY,
in order that‘ a general idea of how
the student body stan"’ds on the matter
may be had by the time that the next
issue of THE -WEEKLY goes to
press. . g - ,"

All nominations for cheerleader
must be signed by ten qualiﬁed stu-
3
dents of the University and given to
W. H. Allen before February 4.

At the meeting on Saturday the
question of “Cap Night” will be taken
up, and the date of this affair will
most likely be ﬁxed at that time.

. ADVISO‘RY BOARD MEETING
ivTh,e regular monthly meeting of
the Advisory Board will be held in

106 State Hall at 4 P. M. next Tues-_

day afternoon. It is requested that
all the managers of the various stu-
dent organizations of the University
be present at this meeting and make
areport as to the condition of their
organization. V
At this meeting there will be a re-
port from the managers of THE
PITT WEEKLY and the Owl, stat-
ing the condition of these student
publications at the present time.

Will some person answer this ques-
tion: What is the date of the School
of Economics banquet?

 

According to the rumors that are
a-broad there will be more football
coaches at the Universitly next fall‘
than students.

 

We hope that some speaker at_ the
journalistic conference Monday night
will mention" the ‘fact to a few of the
WEEKLY reporters that it is bad

H. F. Jenkins, ’l4,,,sanitary engi-
neer, has -been appointed and has ac-
cepted the position as student foot-
ball manager for ‘the’ season of 1913.
This is the ﬁrst time in the history of
the University that a student manager
of football has been selected, in spite
of the fact that it was the most im-
portant branch of athletics at the
University. »With the advent of K.
E. Davis asigraduate manager it was
suggested tlllat a student manager be
appointed to take care _of much of
the work-. around the University
proper and Jenkins was chosen. He
has ‘had’ experience in athletic work
and should be a capable man for the
position.

MILD  Tobacco

"MILD tobacco is soothing, restful, health-
ful, «Strong tobacco irritates and may
cause ‘ nervousness.

Tuxedo is the ideal tobacco. It is the mildest

‘tobacco—yet rich and has a delicious ﬂavor and‘

aroma. ’ — .
" You can smoke Tuxedo all day 1ong—pipeful
after pipeful-—Withou"t making yourself nervous.

Tuxedo can’t bite your tongue or irritate the deli--

cate membranes of your mouth and thro.at-—-
because in Tuxedo ever‘y unpleasant. feature has
been removed by-the famous “Tuxedo process” of
treating the tobacco leaf. '

Evegr new, goodithing is imitated. Tuxedo
was born in 1904, and is»the'original in its ﬁeld.
,Since' "1904 many imitations of Tuxedo have
been created”. Not one of them hastcome within
gunsh=' “ of the kcret process which makes Tuxedo
the pleasantest, healthfulest smoke in the World.
Compare the imitators with Tuxedo: look at
them, and note the lighter, milder color of Tuxedo;
smell them and note the marked superiority of the
odor of Tuxedo; smoke Tuxedo in comparison with
them and youtwill feel a diﬂerence in taste so
sharp that you will never again smoke anything but
Tuxedo. V — *

Test Tuxedo by smoking it for a week. At the »

end of the week your nerves will be steadier, your.
health will be better——and you Will have had the
most enjoyable smoke week of your life.
