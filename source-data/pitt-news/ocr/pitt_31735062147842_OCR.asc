mencement in 1922 an award of $100
be made by the Chancellor, to the
student, man or woman, in any class,
in any department, who shall be

dents as consforming most closely to
the type which in their judgment is
the type that the University should
aim to produce. When the commit-
tee" meets, the Chancellor should pre-
side and should be permitted to ex-
press his views upon the principles

BE ISSIIEII MARCH 8-10

A ticket selling campaign under
the direction of ten captains for the
home concert of the Musical Clubs
was planned by Manager Ralph N.
Parkhill at a meeting of the clubs in
Alumni Hall last Wednesday. Each
captain will have four assistants as
a team and a prize has been offered
by the management for the individual
‘selling the largest number of tickets.

The team having the largest sale
of tickets to its credit will also re-
ceive a prize. It is the intention of
the teams to cover every local alum-
nus: around Pittsburgh. Cards ‘with
the names’ of alumni printed on them
were handed to the various captains
who will see that each alumnus in his
section receives a p-ersonal call from
the members of his team. This will
greatly facilitate the sale of tickets,
and enable the teamsgto also sell out-
siders tickets as well.

Following are the names of the

Russel Carl, president of the clubs,
gave a snappy talk "at the meeting
in which he «stated that it all de-
pended upon the sale of the tickets
for the home concert as to whether
the clubs would be given their usual
Easter trip and banquet.

The first local concert of the clubs
was given last Friday evening in the
First United Presbyterian church at
Grafton H-ei.g'-hts. The concert was

arranged by Mm..lE,.H..Henry- of that‘

PROM GEHTIFICATES
TO BE TURNED m

Certiﬁcates for Junior Promenade
favors must -be turned into the Sen-
ate -Committee, assisting the ﬁnancial
supervisor of social events, in
Room 1, State Hall, before Saturday,
March 11. It is felt that sufficient
time has been allowed alumni and
students who did not receive favors,
to ﬁll out the proper certiﬁcates and
that it would not be fair to those
who had attended to this matter
early to permit this ﬁling of certi-
ﬁcates to lag over a long period of
time.

The Senate Committee, consisting
of C. L. Henry, Katherine Rohrkaste
and Harold Brenner, met last Satur-
dayievening in Room 1, State Hall,
with H. Russell Stahlman, president
of the Junior class, and Thornton
McGovern, chairman of the Junior
Prom, when an informal report was
made as to expenditures and bills
unpaid. Indications, according to
the Senate -Committee, point out
that there will be sufficient funds
for the purchase of favors for those
who did not receive them. Chairman
McGovern was told to pay outstand-
ing bills and to submit his accounts
for audit this week.

Certiﬁcate-s turned in by persons
who stated they did not receive fa-
vors, will be examined by the Sen-
ate Committee and by the Junior
Prom Committee, who will determine
whether they are bona. tide and in
good faith. Students who have re-
'ceived favors and attempt to obtain
an ad-.litional one by ﬁlling out a
certiﬁcate, will be summarimy dealt
with by University authorities, ac-
cording to the Senate Committee.

Place of Banquet Changed
From East Liberty Y. M.
C. A. to the Banquet Hall
of the First U. P. Church

 

All preparations for the Basket-
ball Banquet, to be given the mem-
bers of the Varsity and Freshmen
teams, have been compfleted and indi-
cations point to a most enjoyable
evening. .

Two ianportant changes occurred
during the past week, the place of
the banquet ‘being changed to the
Banquet Hall of the First U. P.
Church, corner of Fifth Avenue and
Thackeray Street from the East Lib-
erty Y. M. C. A., and the date changed
from Thursday, March 16 to Tues-
day, March 21. The first change was
made for the accommodation of the
students, the church being located
nearer the center of University life
and closer ‘to the majority of the stu-
dent’s homes. The banquet room is
ideally arranged for a banquet of
this kind and can accommodate over
200 persons. The changing of the
date to March 21 was found neces-
sary at the last moment.

R. A. McC-ready has ‘been secured
to act as toastmaster. As every stu-
dent knows Mr. »McCready is well
qualiﬁed to serve in this capacity.

Due to the changes stated above
new tickets were put on sale last
Monday. Judging from the sale of
tickets during the first day indica-
tions point to every ticket being sold.
Students who have already purchased
the old tickets can exchange same at
the “Y” Hut. Other tickets arealso
on sale at the “Y” Hut.

' As every student is well aware the
outlook at the beginning of the season
was very encouraging but after a
great start the team had hard luck
and games were dropped by close
margins to both State and W. & J.
However -this did not discourage the
men as they came right back and did
something no other Pitt Basketball
Team had been able to do in ﬁve
years—<iefeatinrg State on Stately
floor. The team then lost its stride

STIIIIENT FRIENDSHIP
EIJNII I3 REIIPENEII

At a luncheon given in the Uni-
versity Cafeteria on Friday at 12:30,
twenty-four women were present as
representatives from student orga~11i'
zations in the interest of reopening
the Student Frie.udshi'p Fund for the
relief of European Students. The
students of Europe are iii a pitiable
condition in regard to =food, clothing,
housing and study materials. A mo-
tion was made at the luncheon that
the women of the University should
reopen the campaign for the Student
Friendship Fund. The condition
among the students‘ was set forth in
a. talk given by Miss Eibersbaoh, sec-
retary of the Y. W. C. A. She said
that the money formerly collected
was practically alil used, and that
monetary aid coming now would be
like a. reinforcement to tidq over un-
til after harvest season.

Dean Amos
Manley were faculty representatives.
A general “Sacriﬁce Week” was
suggested and approved during
which the girls, by dint of giving
up some pleasure for the Week
should save some money for the
fund. The girls are urged not to
merely give a sum of ‘money from
their pockets, but to actually give
up something for which they are

 

about to spend money and give it to

the fund. The sum of sixty-two’ dol-
dars was pledged by those present
at the luncheon. Some of the things
given, up were movies, confections,
carfare, lunch,‘a Saturday afternoon’s
good time, a. pair of white kid gloves
and a, grand opera ticket.

Miss Ebersbaclr presented the sit-
uation to the girls at the regular
Y. W. C. A. meeting on Monday at
12:45 o’clock. After she had made
known the facts, Minnie Kelso and
Mrs. L. K. Manley made an appeal
for money through sa.cr1ﬂce..Card.s

ing the amount of money and the

I
Mr. Allen has what neither of these
older poets possess —. a. natural gift
for rhyme. He. sails off on rhyme like

., a ship before a followingwind. I can

think of no one today, except William
Rose Benet, who revels rand romps in
rhyme as he does, and when it is. as
naturall as that, the mere reading of

, it is a‘ sheer delight. “The Blindman,”

good though the theme is, is really
made buy. his manner of handling
rhyme, and the repetitions _. in it are
nothing short of masterly. The other
long poems in the book, ,“I-lylas” and
“The Hermitage of Bells,” falso owe
their charm to this faculty for rhyme.
‘ [It is evident’ that Mr. ‘Allen is‘ in
love. with beauty. “Wampum. and Old
Gold" ismore noticeable for style
than for content, allthough Mr. ‘Allen
allows too many, careless phrases to
escape him. His ear is not yet fine
enough to detect stamps and echoes
as often as he should, and he has not
learned to be so.sever'e with himself
as to~discard- those he does hear.
What is’ a poem like “Bewitched” do-
ing in the same book with .the finely
imagined. -“DVragon’s Breath,” for -in-
stance? The “mad, glad, clear, lyric

birdsong“ sets one’s’ teeth on edge, .

and “undimmed by unshed tears” is
not only as old as the hills, it was a
wretched thing in the beginning. "Ad-
ding‘the “un” to l“dim1ned,” which is
Mr. Allen’s~ sole contribution to this
weary commonplace, simply makes
the whole, expression unnecessary.
Against these wecan set “the wierdly
descriptive “an echo mewed along

SCARCITY OF INDIVIDUALITY

It is a sad state of affairs when an
American University is so devoid of
leaders that every student activity is
led by one small group of men who
rule the student body and carry out
its plan to suit their tastes, whether
they are right or wrong. A student
body and its activities are the life of
an‘ institution. Some schools com-
plain of no spirit or life on the cam-
pus. Even the students themselves
complain and go so far as to leave
the college that means the most to
them\ because they are not satisﬁed
with the student affairs. They do not

stop to think that a student body

should be 3. Democracy and could be
one if each of them would do his
part. Instead, the average student is
content to sit back and follow the,sug-
gestion of George and vote for his
candidate forthe presiden.cy of ﬁrst
this ‘student activity and ‘then that,
whether he be the proper man for the
job or not. so it goes on and prob-
ably -George’”s candidate is also the
seeker of another important office on
the campus; to besure either. that
or the member of the -small group that

import. It is worse than a sad state
of affairs when a student body, allows
any small number of men to make the
student activities the wheel of a small
mechanical Monarchy. so, to speak.

4 Who can be blamed for allthis harm

to an institution? You look over any
campus and you will see it divided, in-
to” organizations. This is ‘good, be-
cause an organization of 20 men can
do more than a hundred men working

that 90 per cent of the men in these
organizations are’ members only in‘
name, lacking any initiative whatever
and not appreciating the fact that in-
dividuality starts everything and the
organization" ﬁnishes it. So it is that

right or wrong and the sleepy stu-
dents wake up. too “late and kick at
what they have allowed the chosen
few to get away with. This situation
is true of alymost any American col-
lege and can only be remedied by the
individuality of the college men.——The_
Florida Alligator.

DEFETNDING THE POOR FLAPPER,

The patience of humanity is mar-
velous to observe and wonderful‘ to
contemplate. It is truly ‘remarkabl_e
how long we will stand for things. At

gins to tighten a bit, and the endur-f
anceof. the sufferers nears the break-:

of knocking, but we have a limit
some‘ place. We can take on an al-:
most unlimitable amount of radical
propaganda without being bothered,
but eventually we rise and say‘ a few.
things. We. have heard a great deal
about the "flapper, about the girlof
today, and about the college women,
and we wonder if the stuffjis not get-
ting aﬂbit tiresome! 1 1

The humorousmagazines long ago’

started the campalgnion fiappers; the

standard monthlies of a certain char-
acter kept up the good work; and now
we ﬁnd the most digniﬁed of the daily,
press coming out with lots of, head-

lines about the rapid. pace the girls

of modern times are setting for the‘

treat for the city editor to g’et-in at
nice feature storyabout the ﬂappings
It is “hotystuir” ‘for
the magazine section of the “Sunday
edition‘ to have a page or two about
the wild doings of the “Queen -of the‘
Flappers’ Union”, We read it and
smile at ‘ﬁrst,_ but is it notbeginning
to‘ disgust the college students? As-
long as the idea was conﬁned to the
“social set’? of the cities, "we passed
it by with alaugh, but when the ap-
pellatiolnls of 1 the —» feature writers are
being thrown upon college girls in
bulk, we have to stop and think a
minute before ‘we laugh. 1- 0

College girls ‘just naturally do not
ﬁt intosthpe system of “ﬂappery” -as
organized by our friends of the ﬂow-
ing pen. VWe will -‘concede that col-

lege girls now do lots of things that
_would have made the deans; of women,
a decade ago blush, but we hold that 1
‘essentially they are the same morally 0

now as then. , They maydance the

"shuttle instead‘ or thewaltz, but we

doubt if their personal virtues have
declined anyitherebpy. The big point
seems to be that modern girls do
openly what the girls of the past liked
Our modern condi-
tions, social and otherwise, are large-
ly responsible for any apparent dis-
crepancies in the codes of morals as
applied tolthe feminines who natural-
lylfall into the ﬂapper class. After
all is said and done, girls are what
society wants them to be--and so are
men. . ‘A 1
Take a few little characteristics
which are handed to the ﬂapper in
the pictorial representations of her
whichpﬁnd their way into the maga-
zines She may be recognized almost
every time’ by a few landmarks-the
cigaret sticking between her brilliant-

uever hits the knees, the rolled stock-

.‘ ings, and the bobbed hair. Granted
‘ that everybody knows some girl who 1

would fit into such a picture, can we
say that such a maiden is the proto-
type for college Women? Can we say
that co-eds are all of that sort, or that
any great number of them are‘! A

idictatesv-antic woman‘ dresses for -man,
they say. As -for the bobbed hair,
what does that prove? How many
sisters have horn their
tresses, and how many of the more
“devilish” girls have lengthy braids?
The ﬂapper, and remember that
the very word is one that a. year ago
had to be enclosed with quotation
marks to avoid the taint of slang, may
lead a little morefof her own life
now, but we doubt if she is mentally
or morally any less advanced than a
corresponding type some years ago.
She may play more, but it only! serves
to makeiher "work better. She may
use a different sort of language now,
but it is because she ’isn’t the demure
creature she was before women
claimed their independence. She is
out to help herself now, and she doesl
not rely upon the men as she used to.
In short, everything she is and has
done to merit the name she carries
isthe result of a natural tendency of
«every woman to keep upiwith the
procession. '

We laugh at the ﬂapper; we ‘make
her »an‘other.n‘ational type,‘ perhaps;
and some of us condemn, her in the
name of everything from decency to
regeneracy. But now how about her
contemporaries? What do we say of
the men who wear" the goloshes open,
the “trick” hats, the .spa.ts, and the
long cigaret holder? How about
some of, the effeminate -artists who
draw herymost vividly? In short, do.
we do the snapper justice when we
blame her for. all the evils of modern
society? ‘She will either become a
permanent‘ type, or she willdie in the
competition of better types. We shall
she what she does, but. until then,
why not give her a rest?
ﬂapper ﬂap to her.heart’s desire, or
rather as long as the men want her
to. "When the parade has passed, we
can sit back and talkrabout her.

It would seem to be the chivalrous
thing to defend the college girl, rath-
er than laugh at the ludicrous picture
of her which is doled out as the true
representation. It seems that we
have had about enough of this hit-or-
miss ﬂapper publicity. -We are about
readygto claim our rest. Vlfhy not
somebold person come out with a
defensefof the ﬂapper which will at-
tract as much attention as the feat-
ures which ‘do . not give her much
credit? She is human, if she is friv-
olous, and she is natural, if she is a
bit eccentric in the eyes, of_the per-
son waho does not know her.-—-Silver

e . ON TO WASHINGTON .
Tonight's game at Little Washington will have considerable bearing on
the Tri-State basket ball championship. W. & J., with wins. to date over
Pltt and State and. an even break with West Virginia, is at present leading
the field. Avictory for Pitt tonight however should place her on even
terms with Wash-Jeff and another victory for Pitt‘ Saturday, night at Morgan-
town should put the Panthers slightly in the lead. . Hence, a lot hinges on
the results of this wcek’s- games, which incidentally will bring the basket
ballschedule to its’ close. L a L T ,L »:L i «
-The game tonight should be a humdinger in every respect. Both teams
will be out with blood in the eyes, the Panthers to revenge the 31-29 defeat
at Motor Square GardenLtLhrcLe weeks ago andrthc Red and Blackjwarrlorsto
cinch the Tri’-StLLatTe title. it is likely also that the cheering of therival sup-
porters wlll be as ferocious as the actual playing, for in all probability be-
tween 200 and 300 Pitt students will make thctrip to Twashington. All who
can possibly make the trip should do so, for a lively time is promised all who
do .90. PeTLpLwlll abound and,L>i'n case of a victory, Little WashLlngl:on will
u=nLdoubtedLlyL come toLtheL realization that a large number of ultra-loyal Pitt
students. have been -in the town. T-hctrlp promises thrills’ such as clignifLiedL

college students scldomhavc the opportunity to enjoy, and ‘students whogo
cwill not be-required, to know their lessons tomorrow if Pitt Lwlns. Nothing
