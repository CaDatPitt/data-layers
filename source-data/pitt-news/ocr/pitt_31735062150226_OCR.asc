tain a receipt which will admit them
to the test room.

When today’s meeting was called

Panther Staff Seeks Talented
Cartoonists, Writers. Whatnot

Any student who wants to see the
products of his talent published in
the Panther is invited by Frank
Miller, C41, editor, to become a
member of the staﬁ.

Writers of either serious or hu-
morous material, photographers,
artists, cartoonists and ad-copy
writers (the Panther needs every-
thing) are asked to submit samples
of their work to the editorial board.

For writers or cartoonists staff
membership is by publication; if
on.e’s material is printed, he joins
the staff. Artists and photograph-
ers should bring samples of their
work ready for publication. This
material probably will not be pub-
lished, but it will give the board
some idea of the applicant’s abili-
ties, the editor declared.

Even thoughyou are not a writer
or an artist, there may still be a
place for you. If you can write ad-
vertisingcopy or would like to try

Wise 1 Eacchanges  
For Two 10’s as TriolCollect.§“,

When are 250 pennies not $2.50?

According to Hillard Kreimer,
BA42, 250 pennies add up to the
sum of $22.48—with Kreimer, cir-
culation managerof the 1941 Owl,
and two other staff members split-
ting the excess proﬁts.

It all started when Paul Wither-
spoon, E41, an Owl salesman, de-
cided to economize on energy, and
instead of turning in the 250 pen-
nies which he had collected as sub-
scription money to the Tuck shop
( which would have gladly exchang-
ed them for two greenbacks and
four bits), he brought them directly
to Owl headquarters.

Two of the coins were minted in
1909, and ce.rta"n ma.rkings on the
obverse enabled them to be sold for
$10 each. Jerry Feingoldi, BA44,
another member of the yearbook

staff‘, discovered this while recount-

ing the money.

All 0’ which ad.ds up to the fact
that November 8, one week from
today, is the deadline for subscrip-
tions to the Owl, and is also the last
day seniors may have their photo-
graphs taken for publication.

And Kreimer is still trying to di-
vide $20.00 by 3-——evenly!

Paying to Vote

One edifying relationship between the draft and the election
is that the conscription registration machinery nulliﬁes one of the
ancient arguinents waged against absentee voting in this state.

For years the a.nti—abseu.tecrs have orated that the granting to
Pcunsylvanians the right to vote by mail would entail undue red
tape, confusioii, and iiiiiiccessary routine. I W

This, they have ;<aid.»(le.:spi_tc the fact tliat 42 other states per-
mit. citizens tljie riglit to cast. their ballot while ‘away from home
precincts. ,

Because the state constitution already requires that soldiers
be giveii the right to vote even if they are not at their legal resi-
dence, provisions will have to be made for 2.1 tremendous increase in
legalizetl absentee balloting in this state.

A.l'1‘2ll’lg0lllell.i.S for the soldiers can wcll,l;'l)c utilized for non-
military citizens away from home on election day.

The largest group (lenied their t'ra,n‘cliise by this horse and
.buggy law are the college students. j ,

Under the present law, students at the University, living on
campus but legally residing in another Pennsylvania. precinct, are
forced to make a. special. trip home to vote. At’ the present, we do
not make the point that in doing so these students must miss a
complete school day, inasinucli  the,re__is no official holidav for
the day. . l

VVhat we do object to is that this condition virtually forces
the campus college student to pay for tlieriglit to vote in Penn-
sylvania. Actually, payment is seldom made, for the student pre-
fers to pass up his ballot on election dayrather than dig down in
his pocket for train fare home. _

How the state candidates feel on this question niay be a good
question for college students to raise. V

Editor, The Pitt News:

Senator Ziskind, attention:

Up until this time I have pulled
my punches in deference to your in-
telligence, but enough is enough. ‘;.I
want you to know that I now con-
sider you somewhat of a bigoted ass.

I refer to your attack on John L.
Lewis. ‘ V

A man is not necessarily
“Completely demoraliz-ed, a hypo-
crite. a sychophant, an exploiter, a
strike-breaker,‘ or a labor-bait_er,
because he changes his political affil-
iations. ‘ Nor is he necessarily
treacherous, dishonorable nor dc-«
ceit1'u1;f.or that reason.”_ .  . ; ,_

..By the way; Senator, it I remem-
ber correctly you have never writ-
ten anything but political abuse in
favor of Roosevelt. ._

lAt- this point, Senator, I might.
suggest‘ that if you really want to
help yourparty, you had best with-
draw from it. Fair-minded people
are more apt to be repelled than at-
tracted by such concentrated vici-
ousness  your column displays . . .

You are a man of straiige contra-
dictions, Senator. You deplore the
savage, narrow-minded views of
Hitler, and yet, accord.in,g; to your
columns every man who opposes
your viewpoint is either a hypo-
crite, a iool, or a liar. So far as I
can see, the only difference between
you and Hitler is that he can back
his opinions with a machine gun.
Thank God, (the God to whom you
rei'er with such monotonous regu-
larity), Thank God that you are
not in the same political position to
assume Hitler-like authority.

When you leave this column, take
this thought with you: “The essence
of Democracy is freedom of activ-
ity and community broad—minded_-
ness.” You had better expand your
horizon, Senator. Better still, you
had better just expand .

Hamilton Receives

A Bouquet, Too
Editor. the Pitt News:

Since Bob Hamilton distorted and
misrepresented a minority opinion
so completely, I feel obliged to ex-
pose his infantile mistakes.

I believe that minorities are as im-
portant now asrnajorities. No mi-
nority: no»majority.~.; In a dictionary
look “under ‘‘f.ascisrn.’’ -,

 .above all lbelieve that the
people of a "democracy in ‘order to
survive must. be shown and made to
understand ' all_:_ the . existing possi-
bili.ti-es, for change.. For ,_it' we. our-
selves do not ' change,.,: then the

clian.ging,world 'wi1l'1eav_e us .be,hind I

to‘ iii-‘.r.>,t '  decay.

.-One ‘,denun__ciation deserves an-
ol.hei.r'. V  V ' _‘  4

I.‘ ‘propose .a...,new.,,name_.f,for_ the
“Drivel? column. "How about “Ham-
il.ton’s fl".-1311' Trutl_is?”. ,7  _

If I wanted. to .l;noc_k_.the,bottom
right out zrom iundcr-. the bull he
wrote a_.bout_.: “Down, with capital-
ists,” if I wanted to show how'il1og-
ically written and ililogically thought
out it was, I.would only need to say
that Hamilton left out a most im-
portant fact: namely, that all the
people who say “Down with Capi-
talism” in the next breath always
say “Up with Socialism-—or Scien-
tiﬁc Planning--or ’I‘echnocracy——or
Production for Use——or Single Tax.”

But. the whole point of Hamil-
ton’s article is that radicals only
want to tear down, and not build up.
Yet they do want to build up. They
say so. They advance possibilities
for building up. They point out al-
ready existing changes which have
worked elewhere.

Obviously Hamilton is writing
half truths when he fails to m-ention
the complete meaning of the radic-
als.

To me, any man who has access to
the facts and who refuses to use
them is dishonest.

Is the dishonesty shown by Hamil-
ton the stink of a coming fascism of
half truths and lies ieebly antici-
pated by some half awake jour-
nalist‘?

WAA Announces Intramural

Athletics Program for Coeds

By Harriet Harris
In an attempt to give University women an intramural athletics pro-
gram comparable to the men’s setup Women’s Athletic association today
announced tournaments in two sports, for which all University women

will be eligible.

Archery and volleyball have been selected as the sports to open
the program, although as the year progresses, additional sports will be

added from time to time. Aim of
the program is to give the coeds an
opportunity to participate in as
many branches of athletics as pos-
sible during the school year. Com-
petition begins the week of Novem-
ber 4.

‘ Commenting on the program; an
innovation in the history-of wom-
e_n’s athletics at Pitt, Adele Yorio,
Ed41, WAA. president, expressed
conﬁdence in-the success of ‘the ven-
ture.” T . .i.

f “I’m Hsur-e~:: that Pitt girls. want
such a program" and that they will
support it,’ she said. “It’s a grand
chance to promote friendly irivalry
among the different classes. What’s
mo're,”w_e’re sure they’ll have a lot
of. fun beSi.de.$.~':-‘ We'd like to see all
the .. girls. come out, ‘but .sh,0rt..of
that, we want as many as can pos-_
sibly make it. WAA will guarantee
them that it’s
their time.”_- '

ﬁmore _ than worth

.Archery contestants ,will enter in- .

diyidually in fan " open tournament

while volleyball: supremacy .will be ,

decided among various, class teams.

If too many girls come out for one ’,
team, two or more teams may ',be ,
organized. Each team. will-_ choose -

After the volley-
ball championship has been decided
through a regular schedule ofplay,
the winner» may be challenged by
any defeated team or any group of
girls making up a new team.

 

Only qualiﬁcation for participa-
tion in the program is ‘two hours of
practice during the time remaining
before the tournaments open. A
schedule of possible practice times
has been arranged for the Cathedral
gymnasium, and instructors in both
sports will be in _' the gym at the
hours designated below to give in-.
struction whenever necessary.

‘Wednesday: 12:30-1:30

Thursday: '1:30-2530

“This is -._in no sense a tryout

“for no girl who practices for two
hours will be eliminated from actual
competition.” ’ T

Chairman for the entire program
is -Irma ..Hotz, Ed4l,.7  Hilda

charge of archery. ‘ 

Prior to practicing, each partici-
pant must ﬁll out the accompanying

ment she wishes to enter. The ap-
plications must be returned as soon
as possible either to the Cathedral
gymnasium or to some member of

Playing with their backs to the

games.

Top gamefof the day ‘will be the
revenge tilt between the once
beaten teams of Sigma Alpha Mu
and Pi Lambda Phi. In an early
season game the Pi Lams lost to. the
Sammies, 13-0, and should deﬁnite-
ly be th_‘_{.-underdogs in today's fra-

This is an’*oddity in the schedul-

very small chance of playing the
same team twice, but this year the
unusual has happened.

Pi Kappa Alpha is the only team
to conquer the SAM seven, beating
them by a 13-0 score. Artie Hur-
witz and Red Silverman are the
mainstays of the Sammie offense,
with “Big Hack” White proving
himself equal to any line backer on
the defense. Larry Katz and Hil-
liard Kreimer have the burden of
the Pi Lams hopes on their
shoulders.

Sports Setup

In I ntramurals

“A more attractive interfrater-
nity sports program is in store for
University men” was the general
trend of opinion following a meet-
ing of 13 fraternity representatives,
held last week in the home of James
Potts, director of intramural ath-
letics.

Purpose of the meeting was the

.discussion of the fall program, and

the con-clusion reached was that
horseshoes and tennis should be
deﬁnitely discontinued because of
Ihe lack of student interest. In
place of these two minor sports, the
group voted the adoption of badmin-
ton and paddle tennis.

With touch football and speedball
as tearn games, it was necessary to
have sports with two men teams to
complete the card. The novelty of
badminton and paddle tennis should
go far in attracting new interest in
the program.

These sports will get underway
next week as a part of this year’s
schedule. Like horseshoes and ten-
nis, these new sports will be open
to all men in the University. There
will be three leagues, fraternity,
engineering, and independent.

Director Potts later brought up
the question of having an even 12
sport program for’the year with
four sports in each season... In or-
der for this to occur, it would neces-
sitate dropping one of the winter
sports. Basketball, table tennis,
bowling, volleyball, and handball
were the winter sports, of which
one would not be retained. After
a vote, handball received the black-
ball since last year’s student inter-
est wasnot suﬁicient to warrant re-
taining it.

Sports fans may see a preview of
the return of power and glory to
Pitt football tomorrow afternoon,
when an ambitious, aggressive fresh-
man team meets the seasoned veter-
ans of the Panther B squad at the
Stadium.

In this ﬁght for recognition and
future varsity jobs, freshmen and
reserves alike will be giving every
ounce of skill and drive they can
muster, for the Stadium turf on
Saturday afternoon, will be the test-
ing ground for future Pitt greats.

Though no freshman»,-ﬁrst team

should be able to match the veteran
junior varsity squad directed by
Harold Klein. And from his talent
packed gang of ‘hopefuls, freshman
coach Nick Kliskey can send into
the battle such promising recruits
as quarterback E-conomos, ends
Gestner and Pierre, and linemen
LaMonaca and Critchfield.

Almost all the freshmen are
scheduled to see action, for nearly
all of them have varsity possibili-
ties. The game is primarily an ex-
lzibition for the Panther coaching
staff, a display of the chances of fu-
ture Pitt teams.

The freshmen, however, have no
monopoly on potential varsity ma-
terial. In the starting backﬁeld for
the junior varsity team at Navy last
Friday were Walt Fridley, Frank
Saksa, Bill Dutton, and Bob Nial-
loy, and on the sidelines were such

ﬁne backs as Ralph Hammond, Lou A

Sleber, Joe Adamchic, John Ross,
and Ray Rabin-ek. Fridleyw and
Sleber are the veterans of the team.
seniors whose entire varsity careers

have been taken up with the thank- 

less task of providing cannon fodder
for the Pitt first-stringers. '
Saksa May Star ’ ,

Along with Dutton, Ross, and sev-
eral other varsity performers, Sak-

sa has been loaned to, the B team I

to help it over the rough’sp.otsin its
games with Navy and Penn State,
and at the same time to gain com-
petitive experience which hecould
never get on the practice ﬁeld.
Saksa is the Oman who may run all
over the freshmen tomorrow".

Sardi Struggles On

Like the freshmen, the junior var-
sity gridders ar-e expected to use
their entire squad. Reserve line-
men likely to see action include
Allshouse, Martorelli, ' Sampson,
Gartner, Stodgell, Lohmeyer, Klotz,
and Sardi. The case of Sardi is a
particularly good indication of the
spirit of Pitt’s ‘.‘forgotten‘ men,” the
“Milk Squad.” For threenyears he"
has been practicing -with-. thewteam,
solely because he likesto play. foot--i
ball. He typiﬁes the. spirit and am-
bition thatkeeps the Pittxreserves
in there ﬁghting for what some-
times must seem a hopeless-‘cause.
"The B squad expects to’ win: the

freshman squad expects to I-win; the
coaches don't care; they're‘ looking
for varsity material. '
