Students hold rally to protest Pitt estment policy

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

Hundreds of Pitt students gathered
Friday at an outdoor rally staged by the
student organization Students For a
Free South ' Africa, _to protest the
University investment policy in South
Africa.

The students shouted slogans and
wielded signs calling for divestment of
Pitt funds from companies doing

business in South Africa. They formed .

a picket line in front of the Cathedral
of Learning stretching from Forbes to
Fifth Avenue, and then proceeded in-
to the Commons Room on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor of the building, where they held
hands in a large circle as a displayvof
solidarity.

The demonstration was part of the
United Nations endorsed National anti-
Apartheid Protest Day, aimed at get-
ting universities to divest funds from
companies doing business in South
Africa.

Pitt invests in companies only if they
adhere to the Sullivan Principles, a set
of rules governing equal rights for
white and black workers. Pitt has about
$37 million invested in companies do-
ing business in South Africa, according
to the Pitt Divestment Program.

Five speakers spoke to the cheering
crowd on Friday, including Barbara
Sizemore, from Pitt’s Black Studies
Department.

son I call on you to let your conscience

Members of the Student Government
Board congratulated Students For a
Free South Africa at their weekly
meeting last Friday for conducting a
peaceful demonstration.

Board member Avery Abrams said,
“I was very pleased to see that it was
done in a very responsible way. There
were no infractions of the law or
anything like that. I think it really
helped the image of the whole move-
ment by acting in the manner they
did."

In-other business the board continued

front him. We ’ll crush him because we ’re right. ”

a free South Africa, to join our attempts
to make the University of Pittsburgh
divest now,” Sizemore said.

Doug Howell also spoke to the pro-
testers, asking students to support the
campaign. ,

“It is high time that the largest
employer in Allegheny County, the
University of Pittsburgh, follow the
lead of the city council and the school
board,” said Howell, an undergraduate
student at Pitt and a member of
Students for a Free South Africa.

The city council recently voted not
to invest any money in companies do-
ing business in South Africa. Pitt’s Stu-
dent Government Board offered a
similar resolution in support of the
blacks in South Africa. A

Over 700 people have been killed
under the apartheid government in
South Africa in the past year, most of
them black. Many national.organiza-
tions are calling for an end to the op-
pression of blacks by the apartheid
government.

Rashid Soundiata, chairman to the
Black Action Society’s Political Action
Committee, directed his comments at
Pitt President Wesley Posvar.

“How many of you have seen any

consideration of the Hillel allocation’s V‘

request to bring in Robert Clary of the
Simon Wiesenthal Center. The Simon
Wiesenthal Center is a charitable
organization for the preservation of
holocaust education in America.
Last week, the SGB Allocation’s
Committee recommended to deny the
request, because payment of Clary’s
honorarium to the center would be con-
sidered a charitable contribution, which
would violate SGB allocations policy.
But Abrams said last week that an

. agreement had been reached with the

center to pay Clary’s honorarium
directly to Clary, rather than the center,

statement by Uncle Wes [Posvar] on
this issue? He’s ducking. What’s he
afraid of‘? He’s afraid that we’H crush
him when we confront him. We’l1
crush him because we’re right. We
know what_’s up,” Soundiata said to the
applauding crowd. ' '

The Pitt administration issued a state-
ment Friday reafﬁrming the Board of
Trustees policy adopted in May of this
year, based on selectivedivestment.

“We have to pose a threat to these
people [Pitt’s Board of Trustees],
which we do, but we have to be
serious,” Soundiata said. “The
Cathedral is a nice building — maybe
we can occupy it someday.”

Administration buildings at Colum- .

bia and Rutgers universities have been
taken over by students protesting‘ in
favor of divestment.

Asked about ‘future civil disobe-
dience by Students For a Free South
Africa, Soundiata replied that it will de-
pend on the Board of Trustees’
response to Friday’s protest.

“The further they [the Board of *

Trustees] want to take it, the further
we’ll go,” he said. “We’ll go to the
ultimate — whatever it takes. I don’t
want to make any idle threats.”

Hillel allocation request

and that would not be a violation of
allocations policy. The allocations
committee's recommendation was re-
jected last week and was returned to the
committee for reconsideration..

This week, allocations again recom-
mended denial of the program. Pamela
Underwood, allocations chairperson,
stated “The decision is still the same,
that is, to deny the request. Based on
the fact that basically, even though Mr.
Clary could receive a check for $3,000
directly toward him, we see. it as just
a manipulation of policy. It is just a
way to get around regulations.”

Abrams again moved to reject alloca-

tions’ recormnendation and said that the
center was only acting as Clary’s agent.
He also said that if the board rejected
the program because the money Clary
receives may be partly donated to the
center, he would call for an investiga-
tion into the Black Action Society’s
Louis Farrakhan lecture to see if he
would be donating his honorarium to
his Nation of Islam Foundation.
Abrams further stated, “I think the
decision is not based on statistics or
allocations procedure, but rather emo-
tion, and I am afraid to say, bigotry. ’ ’

Board member Dan Taylor said it is
not the board’s job to examine what

Clary would do with his honorarium.
“He will be getting the check made out
to him, and we don’t have to look any
further than that. If he gives it to the
Boy Scouts, that’s ﬁne.” Taylor said.‘

In a letter to Abrams, the center said
its commission would be 50 percent.
Board President Luke Kluchko said he
contacted the chairman of the PPC Lec-

ture Committee, and was told that.

average lecture commissions are 17
percent. Member Lisa Douds said,
“They may be claiming that this is go-
ing to be an ‘agents percentage,’ but

Joe Muscatello and Janine Disanti congratulate one another

Coronation

By Mary Fratis
For The Pitt News

Homecoming Week came to an
end Saturday as this year’s king and
queen were ﬁnally armounced at
half-time during the Pitt-North
Carolina State football game. Joe
Muscatello and Janine DiSanti were
the winners.

This year’s homecoming brought
about controversy concerning cam-
paigning. In defense of campaign-
ing, Janine DiSanti said,“It meant
so much for my friends and family
to support me in so many different
ways. My father went out and had
balloons made for me, and that
meant so much. It was so special
to me to see my friends going out
and doing things because they
wanted me to win. They may get

 

caps Homecoming week

out of hand, but that’s them and I
love them.”

When asked how the candidates
felt about being selected on the
basis of a picture, all but one were
in opposition. Jack Henderson said,
‘ ‘I think more should be said about
the person, like knowing the things
you do on campus and the organiza-
tions you are in.”

Mike Ryan also stressed this: ‘ ‘I
think a list of accomplishments and
activities with your picture would
be nice. I believe the voting for
king and queen should be run on
popularity-popularity in the sense
of personality, looks and ac— ‘
complishments together. The peo-
ple who are well known on campus
are the traditional homecoming
king or queen.”

Homecoming meant many dif-
ferent things to these individuals.
Michelle Anne Bell said the most

important part ofbeing on the court
was ‘ ‘meeting the other candidates
and realizing what the winner was
like and the type of person the stu-
dent body voted for.”

Joe Muscatello, the reigning
king, said homecoming “means
riding around in a car with Wesley
Posvar. It means meeting him and
catching him on the handshake.”
Athena Zarris said “homecoming .
was a lot of fun. I think fun is the
most important part. I think it
should be a time to enjoy Pitt and -
your friends.” ' '

How do the winners feel? Janine
said, “What happened today felt so
good that it’s something I can’t put
into words. It was so special to have
my family and friends there with
me. It will always be a cherished
memory. ” Joe said homecoming
was “making my parents and
friends prou . ” F

  

after being chosen as Pitt’s‘ Homecoming king and queen.

Beirut terrori

(Beirut) —- Terrorists in Beirut have
made a ransom demand. A Beirut
newspaper says the Islamic Jihad ter-
ror group has released a blurred
photograph of what appears to be the
body ofU.S. Embassy Ofﬁcial William
Buckley, whom the terrorists say they
killed-last week. The picture was ac-
companied by an offer to exchange the
body for 100 Palestinians held in Israeli
jails. .

The’. photograph shows the upper
bpdy of a man partially wrapped in a
blanket. Strong light blurs most of the-
man’s face — except for the eybrows,
part of the mustache and the mouth.
Buckley was abducted by three gunmen
in mostly Moslem West Beirut in 1984.
If the latest statement is true, Buckley
would be the ﬁrst American held
hostage in Lebanon to be killed by his

captors.

Senate approves
Budget Amendment

(Washington) — The Senate has
passed a Balance Budget Amendment
to wipe out the Federal Deﬁcit by
1991. Proponents touted the amend-
ment, saying it would force “across-.
the-board” cuts in federal programs.

But close scrutiny shows otherwise.
The measure would not touch Social

Security, Medicaid and Welfare. Those
items-account for about 35 percent of
the budget. .

Senate Budget Committee Chairman
Pete Domenici said about 50 percent
ofthebudgetisofflimitsunderthebill.
Itemsthatcanbecuttobringdownthe
deﬁcit include cuts in the cost of liv-
ing, increases in federal, civilian and
military pensions, as well as Medicare
payments to doctors and hospitals.
Farm programs and student loans are
not exempt from the balanced-budget
ax, either.

  Around the World  

sts set ransom demands for hostage’s body

Senator Gary Hart blasted the
amendment as unfair, saying it makes
cuts in some programs and not in
others.

Soviets deceptive,
Reagan charges

(Washington) -— President Reagan
said t:he Soviets are playing a dangerous
game of deception.

Reagan charged the Kremlin is in-
volved in an offensive arms build-up

/The Pitt =N'ews«-'- Oct'obe'r"lkf; 1985

and development of a space-based
weapon system that he said “is
threatening the security of the West.”

He said Moscow is trying to keep its
activities a secret, while focusing world
attention on U.S. plans to erect a laser-
based space shield against nuclear
missiles.

As next month’s super-power sum-
mit between Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev edges closer,
‘Reagan used his weekly radio speech
on Saturday to call on Moscow to
“come clean” about the Soviet

weapons systems.

Cruise hostages

return to U.S.

(Newark) — Eleven people who
were aboard a hijacked luxury cruise
'liner are back in the U.S. , landing

yesterday at Newark International Air-
port in New Jersey. Mildred Klinghof-
fer was the ﬁrst to emerge from the Air
Force Transport plane. She praised
President Reagan for ordering the cap-
ture of the ship’s pirates. Klinghoffer’s
wheelchair-bound husband, Leon, was
killed by the hijackers.

Pittsburgh Cele

By Pam Marvich
For the Pitt News

Oktoberfest "85, Pittsburgh’s first
rendition of GerInany’s 175-year-old
tradition, reenacted downtown this
weekend, was a huge success,- accord-
ing to John DeSantis, executive direc-
tor of the event.

Just six weeks ago, along with Jillian
Ciorra and Bernie Lynch, DeSantis
formed “The Production Company,”
which produced Oktoberfest, accurate-
ly dubbed “Pittsburgh’s biggest annual

party.”

Held in the David L. Lawrence Con-
vention Center, Oktoberfest had seating
for 4000. The decorations, done in blue
and white, represented the authentic
colors of Bavaria. Nearly everyone
associated with the festival had some
type of German attire on, whether it

was “Lederhosen,” which are leather
pants, or a “Dimdl,” a lady’s dress.
‘According to DeSantis, his com-
pany‘s idea was to produce a contem-
porary Oktoberfest — one with authen-
tic German food and atmosphere, but
with a more upbeat tempo, which
would be determined by the type of
entertainment they could acquire.

Many of the “oompah” bands per-

forrningat the Oktoberfest played very

old music —' music that their grand-
fathers might have heard at their very
ﬁrst Oktoberfest. But like everything
else, Oktoberfest has evolved, and
DeSantis wanted the bands to play
songs that are popular in Germany to-
day. This was done in hopes of attract-
ing a younger crowd, people who
might normally not consider attending
such an event.

Many of the groups contacted were

excited with this contemporary idea,"

because it gave them a chance to try
out some of their new material. Their
success became obvious when hun-
dreds of people jumped up from their
seats and headed toward the dance ﬂoor
to participate in a German version of
“The Bird Dance.”

While German beer-drinking songs
echoed through the hall, the smell of
sauerkraut and sausage filled the air.
A wide variety of German and
Bavarian foods were served —
everything from funnel cakes to
rollmops to German potato salad to
stuffed cabbage. Three authentic
dishes, served at the very first
Oktoberfest, were also on hand —

wurst, beer chicken and roast ox,

Warsteiner beer was served (along with
Iron City), and was named the ofﬁcial
brew of_ Oktoberfest '85.

brates Oktoberfest  

The Oktoberfest celebration
originated 175 years ago in southern
Germany, better known as Bavaria,
when King Ludwig married a beautiful
princess. The reception was held in the
town square to accommodate all the
townspeople. Instead of lasting one
evening, the celebration continued for
six weeks. The celebrants had such a
great time, they decided to do it every
year. In 1817, the breweries of Ger-.
many got involved, and each house set
up tents able to accommodate
thousands of people. ,

The Oktoberfest in Gennany is
organized the same way today. The
celebration rims from late September
into the beginning of October, lasting
a total of 16 days. The idea is to visit
one tent a day, each tent having its own
food, beer and entertainment. In the
four remaining days, one can either re-
visit his favorite tents or recuperate for
next year. The largest Oktoberfest held
outside of Munich is in Kitchener, On-
tario, and lasts for 10 days. Kitchener
is also a contemporary Oktoberfest,
and heavily inﬂuenced Pittsburgh’s
plans.

Though Pittsburgh does boast a large
German population, Oktoberfest was
essentially scheduled for the sake of

S Justice   Speaks

V We of The Pitt News editorial staff must applaud the
comments made by Supreme Court Associate Justice
William J. Brennan Jr.‘ in his address to a seminar at
-Georgetown University on Sat., Oct. 12, 1985. It is
heartening to know that at least one Justice of the United
States Supreme Court will not allow his rulings to be
inﬂuenced by the inane rhetoric of the Reagan Ad-

ministration.

In the past, Attorney General Edwin Meese III has
been openly critical of the Supreme Court, complain-
ing that it has been guilty of disregarding the original
intentions of the drafters of the United States Constitu-
tion. Has Mr. Meese provided convincing evidence to
support such a charge? Or can we rather attribute his
and the Administration's criticism of the Court to_ more
self-serving causes? Does the Administration's assault
not carry this message: we are miffed because the
Supreme Court continues to rule in ‘ways which are not
in accordance with our political preferences, our
policies, and our narrow interpretation of the Constitu-
tion? Hmmm  intriguing questions wouldn’t you say?

Justice Brennan charged that 1 the Administration’s
criticisms are designed to cloak a political bias and said
that, “it is arrogant to pretend that from our vantage
we can gauge accurately the intent of the Framers [of
the Constitution] on application of principle to speciﬁc,
contemporary questions.’ ’ Furthermore, he argued that
the Framers were not of a single mind and frequently
disagreed among themselves. This often led to vague
and ambiguous constitutional‘ phrasing that allows for
broad interpretive discretion.

Justice Brennan justly objects to the executive
dling in the affairs of the judiciary. It is reassuring to
witness a member of the Supreme Court asserting his
independence. Good for you, Mr. Brennan. Hurrah!

  Good Gardening

This letter is written in response to
Mr. John Picone’s Letter to the Editor
published in The Pitt News on Oct. 4,
1985.

Unfortunately, John, you make an
error in‘ moving from pruning — an ac-
tivity that all good gardeners engage in
— to axing healthy trees. A good
gardener at Roanji, one of the great
gardens in Kyoto, prunes carefully to

improve the garden for many genera-

tions into the future. I shall resist draw-
ing analogies to academic programs,
students, faculty or administrative
leadership. -
You, and other readers, may be in-
terested in another slightly misplaced
comparison. Forest managers are
charged with maintenance and im-
provement of forests. Apparently,

‘ forests simply burn down every hun-

dred years or so, destroyed by light-
ning. This evidently improves the
ecological system necessary to restore
the forest and the trees that follow.
Forest rangers have another strategy
available when faced with the necessi-
ty of dealing with unhealthy trees. They
sometimes place loose chains around
the tree in question and eventually the
tree chokes to death on the chain. This
is known as“girdling.” When to burn,

/ when to girdle, when to leave nature

alone? That is the question.

However, Mr. Picone, in today’s

high-tech world where Doctor ’Detre’s
associates are implanting “artiﬁcial”
devices in humans and Professor
Slawson implores computers to com-
pose music, what is natural? For ex-
ample, would you feel better if the trees
axed were plastic? You are then left
with the question of whether a plastic
tree is nonetheless a tree.

My theory is that the trees, that

looked ﬁne to me as well, were

destroyed at the request of student
groups (largely male) that wished more
space for football; and the trees were
essential distractions. »

The FAS-GSO justification for their
lack of action on the apartheid question
(“The Pitt News” Oct.ll) is appall-
ing in its insensitivity and drivel. Their
claim that to be against apartheid is to
become a “vehicle for political
movements” rather than to represent
the interests of graduate students is
ridiculous. To oppose apartheid would
represent the interests of the vast ma-
jority of graduate students. I suggest
they hold a referendum on the subject
if they are so out of touch with the
graduate student body.

They claim they notiﬁed their
membership on the recent anti-
apartheid protests at Pitt in order,:

. Letters to the Editor  

presumably, to remain unsullied by any
moral decisions and allow individuals
to attend. This “notiﬁcation” never ap-
peared to me or any other graduate stu-

dent I know in the history, GSPIA,‘ 

theatre arts, anthropologyor English
departments. Just who did they notify?
I suppose they mean they told only the
same self-serving officers who are
more concerned with throwing beer
blasts than with taking stands. on irn-
portant issues facing the university.
The arguments individual officers of-
fered against endorsing the protest as
reported in a letter of Oct. 4 show the
body to be clearly insensitive, ignorant
and racist in their propositions that

graduate students here are as bad off I

as blacks in South Africa, or that blacks
shouldn’t complain about their treat-
ment because people are repressed in
other areas of the world, too.

They certainly don’t represent me on
this issue.

I No Hunting

I would like to reply to the letters
written by Mr. Brodbeck and Mr.
Muncini on the subject of hunting.

I First of all, I would like to address .

the necessity of hunting for food. True,
some people do actually hunt because
they can't afford to buy meat for their
families. However, most people who
really need food can’t afford to buy a
shotgun, bullets, a license and the ap-
propriate clothing needed for safe
hunting.

Let’s face it. ‘Most people hunt to get
an “ego boost.” They enjoy chasing
a defenseless and scared living creature
through the woods. It makes them feel
powerful and “in charge." I won’t call
hunting “stupid, ” but I will term it
“inhumane.” You can tell that most
people don’t hunt to obtain food or to
‘ ‘help’ ’ the deer population. If they did,
there would be no need to publicize
their “kill” in the local newspaper and
brag about how many “points” it had.

As Mr. Brodbeck pointed out, it does
make sense to shoot the overpopulation

' of deer (giving the meat to needy peo-

ple) so that the deer won’t starve to
death during the winter. However, if
people are so concerned about “thin-
ning out” the deer population to pro-
mote a "healthy” herd (as Mr. Mun-
cini mentioned), I believe that the
“job” should be given to competent,

truely concerned and knowledgeable

people such as park rangers or game
commissioners. I believe this because
there are many incompetent hunters
who shoot at, injure, but fail to kill
“their” deer._They then attempt to
“bag” another deer, possibly with the

. same results.

Now, in Mr. Muncini’s article, he
stated that hunting “is a harvest to

. make the deer population healthy,'to

weed out the sick and injured animals
that shouldn’t survive for the next
year.” I wonder, does this mean that
hunters stop the deer prior to shooting
them and  as to what their health
is? Of course not!- My query and his
statement are both ridiculous. We both
know that no hunter, whether out for
an “ego boost” or whether concerned
with food needs (especially one con-
cemed with providing food for his
family) wants to “bring down” a sick
or injured animal. It just wouldn’t be
w)orth his time or money. Now would
it. -

Food Crimes

We must object to the new enforce-
ment of the policy prohibiting food in
Hillman Library by the campus police
force. Why should the university invest
money in a “Food Crime Watch”
when there are many more serious of-
fenses that should be delt with?

For instance, while studying for an
Organic Chemistry test, my book was
stolen. Meanwhile, -on the other end of
the library, somebody was being issued
a citation for drinking coffee
(sometimes a necessity for many hours
of studying), by our dedicated campus
policemen.

We, as students, who pay approx-
imately $3,500 a year in tuition ab-
solutely cannot swallow this fact. Why
not defer this money in trying to catch
the thieves who steal hundreds of books
each semester? If this is unreasonable,
how about an escort system for people
who have to walk to South or North
Oakland after studying to 2 a.m. at the
library (excuse us, 12 a.m.)

‘the I’1tt News - Uctober 14, 1963

Simply Speaking/Michael Ashford

The political turmoil in South Africa
is, thanks to the current mass media
barrage, well understood by many peo-
ple: a government representing the in-
terests of South Africa’s ﬁve million
whites is violently struggling to main-
tain power and control over a political-
ly disenfranchised, socially oppressed
black majority of 22 million.

The immediate implication for us all
as members of the university communi-
ty lies in the call for divestment.'I'he
divestment issue, however, represents
a situation where, as one colleague has
put it, “anger in the name of social
change has met head on with ,the
realities of ﬁnancial investment.”

The economic realities of the South
African crisis are, unfortunately, not
so well understood by most people, in-
cluding myself. But a closer look at the
economics of the situation does suggest
why the Reagan adrninistration’s half-
hearted policies are so confused and
why the university adheres to its policy
of ‘ ‘selective divestment. ’ ’

An econornist’s perspective on any
political issue is sometimes in-
timidating, often perplexing and always
frusuating. In the case of South Africa,
most of us see a country ﬁnally facing
the consequences of a tyrannical and
violent political system after centuries
of unjust white-minority rule. But an
economist, adhering to his calculations,
is more likely to see a government of
strong economic standing, capable of
paying debts and perhaps attractive to
investors. Granted, last Augusts’s Ned-
bank crisis, (South Africa’s largest
bank), did upset Wall Street, but the
crisis quickly abated when the South
African government intervened to back
up its indigenous banks.Those who
oversee the ﬂow of international funds,
vital to any country ’s international
trade, were greatly relieved.

Why? Because for those economists,
as well as most foreign policy makers
in Washington, economic stability
takes precedence over all political and
social ideals.

The relationship between a country's
overall economic standing in the mter-

’ national banking system and its attrac-

tiveness to foreign_investors is com-
plicated, but the general rule is, the bet-
ter its standing, the more attractive to
investors it will be. South Africa is well
aware of this and has attempted to
freeze repayments on principal debt
—— the original sum borrowed ——
to protect its greatest asset, foreign cur-
rency holdings. Outstanding debts are
repayed in strong foreign currencies
like U.S. dollars and West German
marks. As long as South Africa has
large holdings, it will retain its “ good’ ’
economic status.

The dynamics of the international
banking system reﬂect the more con-
crete activity of international trade.Ac-
cording to a recent Commerce Depart-
ment report, the U.S. receives most of
its metals from South Africa, more than
half of its cobalt, chromium and
platinum, for example. These metals
are vital to many strategically impor-
tant industries such as steel and
aerospace. The Commerce Department
also stated that 3.2 million jobs also re-
ly on these metal imports. The key
alternative source, cold warriors warn,
is the Soviet Union.

The complexities of international
ﬁnancing as they relate to South Africa
have far reaching consequences.
Politics and economies are inextricably
entwined.

What of the more than 700 people
killed over the past year? What of the

thousands being detained, tortured and .

imprisoned without trial? The South
African government has the coercive

Economic Complexities of Divestment

forces necessary to stay in power and
is using them willingly.Sadly, arms
supplies to South Africa are assured
through extensive trade with Israel.

Thus, with the banks and ﬁrms safely
tucked behind the shield of violent state
oppression, international ﬁnanciers can
continue their routine operations.

As long as economic stability and
military superiority are assured, the
South African government will make
no signiﬁcant effort to reform. The
Reagan administration is presumably
well aware of this. Economic stability
is an historical axiom of U.S. foreign
policy, Central America being the
paradigmatic example. Once again our
government has opted for short-term
economic stability despite the inherent
long-term consequences.

Given the South African govem-
ment’_s intractability, the recent shake-
up in their international ﬁnances
demonstrate something which should
greatly inﬂuence the university’s
divestment policy: the only leverage
against South Africa we have at this
time is economic. The South African
govemment’s only fear is ' being
locked out of the international fmanc—
ing system. Therefore, as long as this
university retains holdings in ﬁrms
which do business in South Africa,
regardless of the selective policy
based on the Sullivan principles, it is‘
reinforcing South Africa’s economic
stability and in turn encouraging that
government to violently resist in-
evitable change. .

Every day we see the immorality of
a U.S. foreign policy motivated by the
desire for short-term economic stability
and ultimately, short-term proﬁt. If this
university has any claim to democratic
aspirations, it must end its complicity
with the Reagan administration and
divest completely, now.

By Randy _Miller
Staff Writer

“The Pitt Vow — We Will
Never Beat Ourselves Again”

These words are important to the
Pitt football team. They hang on a

‘wall in the locker room and have
special meaning. The players
believe it is only their fault, not the
oppos_ition.’s, .that they have two
losses and a tie at this point of the
season.

Trailing North Carolina State, a
17-point underdog, in the second
quarter 10-0 Saturday, Pitt realized
they were once again beating
themselves. ’

and "scored two fourth—quarter
touchdowns to beat the Wolfpack
24-10 before 36,605 fans at Pitt
Stadium.

Pitt’s freshman tailback Brian
Davis broke a 10-10 tie with 13:44
remaining in the game as he broke
through several tackles on the way
to a dazzling 23-yard touchdown
run.

Davis’ touchdown came on his
ﬁrst carry of the day, as he spent
most of the afternoon watching
Charles Gladman rip off a career-
high 178 yards. When Gladman
tired, Davis made the most of his
chance. '

“It was a trap play,” said Davis,
who rushed for 61 fourth—quarter
yards on only 10 carries. “I found
the hole, got hit a few times, but
I keptmy balance and kept on go-

leaving the game with a badly

Congemi’s replacement, Joe Felit-

passing yards for the game a fat

being on crutches believes he'll be

On N.C. State’s ﬁrst possession,
quarterback Erik Kramer split the

strike.

“We came out sky high, and then

' they hit a bomb like’ that on the third

play and it takes the wind out of

said. “Our guys were really down

N.C. State, 1-5, tooka 10-0 lead
late in the opening quarter when
Kelly Hollodick booted a 34-yard
ﬁeld goal. Once again, the points
were set up via the long pass as
Kramer hooked up with Mack
Jones for 47 yards.

‘ ‘Those two long passes made us
work that much harder,” said Pitt
comerback John Lewis, the victim
on the pass that set up the ﬁeld goal.

“Today there was a lot of
pressure on our defense,” said
Fazio. “I told them at halftime to
shut them out and try to get some
points, and that’s exactly what they '
did.” '

. The defense decided to take mat-
ters into their -own hands. Pitt
defensive end Bill Sapio sacked
Kramer from the blindside forcing
a fumble that Tony Woods
recovered on the N.C. State 36.

Gladman followed by ripping off
28 yards down the right sideline to

Letter Club Ijonors
Hennon heads list for Awards of Distinction

Leroy Lewis, Don Hennon, Morton
Lerner and Donald Fisher received
Awards of Distinction at The Pitt Var-
sity Letter Club’s 25th Annual
Homecoming Awards Dinner in the
Assembly Room of the William Pitt
Union on Friday evening.

The Awards of Distinction are
presented armually to four members of
the Pitt Varsity Letter Club who have
distinguished themselves in their pro-
fession’ and enhanced the value of the
intercollegiate athletic program at Pitt.
Recipients must be out of school for at

All four recipients of the Award of
Distinction played vital roles in their
respective athletic programs while at
Pitt. Hennon was perhaps the best
knbwn. He starred in basketball at Pitt
during the late ’50s. He arguably re-
mains the greatest Panther basketball
star of all time. Twice an All-America,
Hennon was the ﬁrst Pitt athlete to have
his jersey number (10) retired.

Following his graduation, Hennon
established himself in the medical ﬁeld.
For the past 15 years, Hennon has
practiced general and peripheral
vascular surgery in the greater Pitts-

burgh area. He is currently a Senior At-
tending surgeon at both Allegheny
General Hospital and North Hills
Passavant Hospital.

“I feel very honored to receive this
award,” said Hennon. “Especially
when this is the ﬁrst year I'm eligible.
I only graduated in 1959, and it's quite
an honor to be chosen so soon.” ‘

Also lettering in basketball was
Lerner. He played under the legendary
Doc Carlson on the team known as
“Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Carlson was Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs were the top seven‘ players on

Soccer team ties Mountaineers,
Torrence breaks another school record

By Teresa Varley
For the Pitt News

Memories of several weeks ago
returned to Mountaineer Field last
Friday as the Pitt soccer team tied
West Virginia 0-0 in overtime.

However, regardless of the
score, it was a game the Panthers
could come away from holding
their heads high.

“Both teams played a very
physical game,” said coach Joe
Luxbacher. “It was a tough game
and we fought hard.”

‘ Guided by the inspired play of

the defense, the Panthers battled off
many Mountaineer attacks. The
Mountaineer offense put pressure
on the Panthers. but goalie Dave
Torrence responded making
numerous saves while recording his
seventh shutout of the season, a Pitt
record.

The game was a back and forth
struggle as both teams saw scoring
opportunities slip away from them.
Regulation time ended with no
scoring on either side. then both
teams played an action packed
overtime period. There were some
tense moments, especially in the
closing seconds when Torrence

winning goal for the Moimtaineers.

“I was pleased with the way we
played , ’ ’ Luxbacher commented.

team. They have played a lot of na-
tionally ranked teams."

The Panthers are currently 8-1-1 ,
and have held their opponents to
only ﬁve points so far this season.

Currently, Lerner is President and

they did in college. Pitt is unique in that
they are honoring post-collegiate ac-
complishments, which is why we were
there in the ﬁrst place."

Fisher, the third awardee, left his
mark on the gridiron. Fisher earned
two letters in football, one in 1943 and
one in 1948, sandwiched around a
military stint as an aviator inthe Navy.
Fisher played center in both the single
wing and T-forrnation offenses Pitt
employed" in those years.

Currently a well respected lawyer in
Houston, Texas, Fisher did not expect
to receive an award like this.

“Frankly, I was amazed and shock-
ed to receive this award," Fisher ex-
plained. “When you look at how much
all the nominees have accomplished,
it‘s really ﬂattering. I didn't expect to
win .... .. my wife and I had even
planned a scuba diving trip for the
weekend of the award dinner.“

One with much the same sentiments
about his chances was Lewis. Currently

Pitt

Defense

saves
Panthers  

By Michael Bertonaschi
Staff Writer

The celebration of tradition con-
tinues. It took awhile to get it started '
on Saturday, but once it got rolling, it
was time to batten down the hatches.-
How appropriate that on this day,
against North Carolina State, the
athletic department gave away a replica
of the jersey worn by one of the
greatest defensive players who ever
played college football, Hugh Green.

During the week the defense had
been watching ﬁlms of past Pitt teams
that included Hugh Green and Rickey
Jackson at defensive end. For three
quarters of the Panthers’ 24-10 win
over N.C. State, the defense played
with the kind of reckless abandon that
they saw in the ﬁlms of early Pitt
defenses.

“Watching those ﬁlms gets me ex-
cited because I'm playing the same
position that Hugh Green did,” said
rush end Tony Woods. “I look at those
ﬁlms and look at the little things that
he did and try to learn from them.”

“The techniques that they used
worked for them, and sometimes we
canusethemandalsothewaythatthey
hustled to the football, ’ ' said drop end
Bill Sapio. “Not only were they great
athletes and great technicians but they
hustled to the ball which made them
that much better, and that’s what we
need in our defense.”

For the ﬁrst quarter on Saturday the _

defense resembled last year's-porous

squad instead of the Hugh Green days. _

Most of the crowd of 36,605 had not
even reached their seats yet when wide
receiver Phil Brothers caught a 90-yard
touchdown pass to give the Wolfpack
a 7-0 lead. -:

“They took their tight end out and
put Brothers in as a wide receiver at
the tight end spot, and our free safety
just came way too far over to the mid-
dle of the ﬁeld," said head coach Foge
Fazio. “Our linebacker was running
with the receiver, but he can’t go 30
to 40 yards down the ﬁeld with a wide
receiver. It was just a broken play on
our part."

N.C. State scored again on theirthird
possession when Kelly Hollodick hit on
a 34-yard ﬁeld goal with 3:49 to go in
the ﬁrst quarter. The long gain of the
drive was a 47-yard pass from Kramer
to Mack Jones that resembled the
touchdown pass.

“When they hit the long one it kind
of took the wind out of our sails. Then
theyhittheseoondoneandgottheﬁeld
goal, and I think our sails were com-
pletely empty,’ ‘ said Fazio. “For-
tunately, we came back and got the tie
at the half, but the defense really
cranked_it up after those two plays. I
thought they really came on very, very
strong." V ’

The pressure was put on the defense
when starting quarterback John Con-
gerni suffered a sprained ankle late in
the second period and it was apparent
that he would not return. At that point
the defense took over and totally
dominated the game. .

“We had the momentum, and we
wanted to keep it until the offense got ‘
on track." said Sapio. “John got hurt
and Joe came in, and that’s a tough
position for him to be in. We wanted
to give him time to get his feet wet."

With Pitt ahead 17-10 alter a 23-yard
touchdown run by Brian Davis,
Wolfpack quarterback Eric Kramer
dropped back to pass from his own
endzone. Right tackle Bob Buczkowski
swatted the ball from Kramer's hands,
and Woods fell on it for his ﬁrst
touchdown ever. There was now 9:01
to go in the game. and the way that the
defense was playing. it was party time.

“There was alot of pressure on our

irie Pitt News - October 14, 1985

By Jim Urban

A victory — not as Fazio views it

Pitt head coach Foge Fazio is a
perfectionist. One would think that a
coach whose team came back from a
10-point deﬁcit to a 14-point victory
would be happy. That was not the case
on Saturday. It was not a happy Foge
Fazio, not even a relieved Foge Fazio,
that walked into the post-garne press
conference following Pitt’s 24-10 vic-
tory over North Carolina State at Pitt
Stadium.

“We only gained 290 yards,” said
a disgusted Fazio as he sat on one of

.Pitt’s nautilus machines in the Pitt

weight room. “We had NO yards pass-
ing! You can't beat anybody, com-
pleting four passes, without getting any
yardage.”

That is exactly what happened on
Saturday. Starting quarterback John
Congemi completed two of 10 passes
for six yards before leaving the game
attheendoftheﬁisthalfwithasevere
ly sprained ankle. His replacement, Joe
Felitsky, completed two of ﬁve at-
tempts for a negative six yards. Felit-
sky’s longest completion went for all
of one yard.

“We completed four passes out
there, out of 15,” cracked Fazio again,
adding almost disbelievingly, “and we
still won the game. ” Fazio stated fur-
ther, “We just have to work like ‘hell
on offense. I’m really upset. We have
to work like crazy!”

Congerni’s status is still questionable
for next Saturday’s game against
Rutgers.

“Congemi probably will be out for
next week’s game,” explained Fazio.
“We have to get John Cummings and
Joe Felitsky ready to play.”

Congemi contradicted that statement.
The senior from Lauderdale Lakes,
Fla. , was alarmed at ﬁrst, but later con-
ﬁdent that he will return for this week.

‘ ‘They thought I chipped
something,” said Congerrii. “They
checked my ankle and they checked my
knee also. It turns out it was only abad
sprain. I should be back practicing
Tuesday.”

When told Fazio had said he would
not play, Congemi replied, “I '11 play. ”
Congemi does not want another year
like last year.

“Hopefully I’H be okay by Tuesday
and get out and practice,” said Con-
genii. “That’s the important thing. I
learned a lot from last year when I was
hurt. I didn’t get to practice and I lost
a little bit of my sharpness.”

How important is Congemi to the Pitt
offense? Tailback Charles Gladman,
who rushed for 176 yards on 27 car-
ries on Saturday, is one Co'ngemi’s big-
gest fans.

“Congemi is the key to this of-
fense,” said Gladman following the
game. ‘ ‘When Congerrii plays well like
last week [Pitt’s 42-7 victory over
South Carolina] we score 42 points.
When Congerrii went down, we had to
work that much harder to make up the
difference,” Gladman added. “Con-
gerrii is the key. No matter how well
the running backs play or how many
yards we gain, when Congerrii’s click-
ing, we win big.”

Who the quarterback will be this
week is still undetermined. If Congerrii
is healthy, he will play. If he cannot,
it will be either Cummings, a senior
from Montclair, N.J., or Felitsky, a
sophmore from Pittsburgh. Whoever it
is, Fazio has some things for them to
concentrate on this week in practice.

“I don’t care who the quarterback is,
he has to work hard,” said Fazio. “We
have to get the timing there, we have
to block better on offense. Whoever is
in there has to work a little bit harder
on offense.”

So while in the midst of a two game
winning streak, Fazio ﬁnds himself in
the middle of a trying situation.
Without a healthy experienced quarter-
back, the Pitt passing game may be in
the midst of a sabbatical.

Pitt football practice should be in-
tense this week.

Tennis team downs West Liberty,
winning season is guaranteed

By Greg Ficery,
Staff Writer

The Lady Panther tennis team, in
their last home match of the season,
guaranteed themselves a winning
record by defeating West Liberty Col-
lege 8-1, on Friday afternoon, at Trees

Courts. The Lady Panthers raised their ‘

record to 7-5 with one match
remaining.

Coach George Dieffenbach gathered
his team together before the match in
order to honor his ﬁnal-year players
with pairs of blue and gold ﬂowers.

 

  

This seems to have provided the spark

of the season against a team that was
expected to provide stiff competition.

For No. 1 player Miriam Goltz, who .

is playing in her ﬁnal year of eligibili-
ty as a graduate student, it was a rriatch
to remember. Heading the lineup, she
controlled the tempo of her match and

“It was the best match I’ve played
all year,” Goltz beamed. “I was real-
ly able to be aggressive today. I haven’t
felt that good out there in a while.”

Kris Peckman, the last senior on the
squad, also came up with a sparkling
performance as she wiped out her op-
ponent at the No. 1 spot and teamed

with Bridgit Kyle at the No. 3 doubles,

totally overpowered her weaker oppo- 5.

nent en route to a 6-4, 6-0 victory.
Later, she teamed up with senior Julie
Gress to dominate their opposite
numbers and capture the win at the No.

credit, but the line deserves it.”

With Pitt now controlling both
lines of scrimmage, they now had
the momentum. -

On Pitt’s next possession they
tied the score with a roughing-the-
passer penalty paving the way.
Mark Brasco, after winning the
placekicking job this week in prac-
tice, in his only attempt, kicked a
35-yard ﬁeld goal.

“I heard the fans booing me,”
said Brasco, who now is 4 for 8 in
ﬁeld goals. “It got me pumped up.
I knew they would cheer me if I
made it.”

On the play prior to Brasco’s

would-be touchdown pass‘that was

’ disallowed because receiver Chuck
Scales was ruled out of the end
zone. Congemi, however, was in-
jured on the play and watched the
rest of the game. '

“I was throwing the ball and a
guy came in and rolled over my

ankle,” said Congemi. “I think my
leg buckled underneath me.”

Pitt was forced to use the inex-
perienced Felitsky, a sophmore
transfer from Notre Dame.

“Joe needs a lot of work,” Fazio
said. “He hasn’t had very much
playing time.”

With Felitsky at the helm, the Pitt
offense sputtered in the third
quarter, but the defense continued
to shut down N.C. State. Pitt ﬁnally
received a scoring opportunity in
the beginning of the fourth quarter
when Teryl Austin returned a punt

‘ 19 yards to the Wolfpack 23.

That’s when Davis spelled Glad-
man. Davis dashed through the
‘center of the line and bounced off
defenders like a pinball machine,
never letting up until Pitt had their
ﬁrst lead of the day.

The Panther defense iced the
game by obeying Fazio’s order to
score points. Bob Buczkowski hit
Kramer’s throwing arm in the end
zone forcing the ball free. A div-
ing Woods recovered his second
fumble of the game, but this one
was worth six points.

“It feels great to score,” said
.Woods, a 6-4 junior who has quiet-
ly become one of the best defensive
ends in the nation, “especially since
it came in a crucial situation.”

N.C. State Coach Tom Reed had
nothing but praise for Woods, who
had six tackles besides the two fum-
ble recoveries. .

“Tony Woods is an awfully good
football player,” Reed said. “He’s
very, very difﬁcult to. block and
caused us a lot of problems. He's
the best defensive player we will
face this year.” p

Fazio agrees. “Tony Woods is a
great, great football player,” Fazio
said. “He has to play well every
week for us to win.”

Fazio knows the entire defense
must play well for Pitt to win next
Saturday at Rutgers. ‘ ‘The defense
must take control,” Fazio said.
“Offensively, we need ‘a lot of
work. I don’t think John [Congen1i]
will be ready to play next wee .”

Woods is conﬁdent Pitt will be
ready to play Rutgers. “See that
sign?” said Woods, pointing to one
, near the locker room exit that says
‘Start of Real Panther Pride —
Team Goal 8-2-1 — Let's Make It
Happen.’ That’s our goal. We feel
like we could be 6-0 right now.
There isn’t a team that we played
we can't beat,” he added.

Oh yes, there's one more sign in
the locker room. It says “l Down
+ 6 = Bowl, Y-Not.” Next week
it will read two down and ﬁve to

go.

Saturday, Pitt didn’t beat
themselves when they could have.
Who knows? Maybe a bowl game
isn’t out of the question after all this
season.

A win solves a lot of problems. The
Lady Panther’s volleyball team
defeated Bowling Green 15-7, 15-4 and
15-8 for their 18th victory of the
season. Coach Shelton Collier said,
‘ ‘I'm very proud of the team today. We
played one of our best games today as
a unit, but also in terms of individual
performances and statistics.”

Lisa Stewart, Louise O’Shaughnessy
and Kris Wexell each gave one of their
better perforrnances.The Pitt offense
wasn't dominated by one or two
players. Top honors in spiking were
divided up among seven ‘or eight
players. Coach Collier believes, ‘ ‘It is
good when a team can win and have
no real dominant player. It feels good
to win big and play so well as opposed
to struggling with our attitudes and
game as we have previously.”

Senior captain Judy Young also
chipped in with one of her ﬁnest per-
formances to date". Kris Wexell re-
gained some of her serving form and
lead both teams in that category. The
Lady Panthers made very few errors.
Coach Collier deemed the victory a
“breath of fresh air.” Following a
disappointing loss to arch-rival Penn
State and a narrow escape from
Georgetown, Pitt was ready to get back
on thewinning track. This win couldn’t

Lady Panthers back I
on winning track  

have come at a better time for the Lady
Panthers.

In a previous interview, Coach Col-

lier stated (reﬂecting upon the fact that
the starting line-up was not yet set
up),“I really don’t know how the BG
squad will prepare for us.” Though
Bowling Green is a well coached team,
the Lady Panthers played an excellent
set of matches. With a victory like this,
the team’s confidence should be
restored. And, coming into a weekend
homestand, Pitt can use. the added
advantage. .
Volleyball notes: The Lady Panthers
play league rival Providence Thursday
at 6:30 p.m. in Fitzgerald Field House.
The USA silver medal volleyball team
will match skills with the Japanese Na-
tional team in the following game.
Tickets are $4.50, $6.50 and‘$8.50. An
expected crowd of 4,000 will be on
hand to see the game (2,500 tickets
have already been sold).The national
teams will-begin play at 8:30 p.m.

Penn State invades Pitt’s territory
Friday night at 7 p.m. Penn State, aside
from being the Lady Panthers’ arch-
rival, is a very competitive squad this
year. On Saturday, Pitt plays host to
Georgetown. This should prove to be
an exciting match because of the Hoyas
ever-improving game.

defense because you could tell when we
went out for the second half, it didn’t
look like we were going to score at all.
I told the defense we have to shut them
out and get points ourselves, ’ ’ said
Fazio.

The numbers the defense put up are
frightening. N.C. State had 266 yards
of total offense, but if you take away
the 90-yard touchdown pass and the
47-yard yard pass that set up the ﬁeld
goal, they gained only 129 yards. Pitt
recovered two fumbles and intercepted
Kramer twice and sacked him four
times for 31 yards in losses.

1 At the beginning of the year the
defense struggled and the offense
looked sharp. It now appears as though
the roles have been reversed. If it were
not for Charles Gladman’s career-high
176 yards on 27 carries, the offense
would not have moved the ball at all.
Pitt had zero yards passing and con-
verted only ﬁve of 17 third down
situations. .

‘ ‘Offensively we just need a heck of
a lot of work,” said Fazio. “I don’t

With the defensive line and Woods
and Sapio playing with the reckless
abandon of old, it looks as though the
defense will be able to carry their share
of the load. Hugh Green would have
been proud to have watched Saturday’s
game but defensive end coach Gerry
Solomon will not let his players do that.

“Coach Solomon keeps pushing us
and telling us that we're not even
average football players yet,” said
Sapio. “Maybe at the end of the season
he might decide a little differently if we
are 8-2-1 and go to a bowl game, but

until then, he tells us that we’re
pitiful.”

Tennis

continued from page 8
7-2 last year, Dieffenbach appears to
be aware of the intangible importance
of conﬁdence to a tennis team.
The experience factor also comes in-
to play as the Lady Panthers prepare

to face the competition at the Big East 7

Conference Championships.

‘ ‘West Virginia iscomparable to the
better teams_ in the Big East,” said
Dieffenbach. ‘‘It’s good to be able to
play a match like this before we go out
there.”

The Big East Championships will be
held on Oct. 25 and 26 at Villanova.
