The all-but-announced candi-
date for the Democratic nomina-
tion for the presidency in 1960

addressed an overﬂow crowd at
the Midday Series last Thurs-
day. The audience, .unofﬁcially
at almost 2,000, was the largest
crowd ever to attend a, Midday

The crowd welcomed Kennedy
with a-long, hearty applause as
he pushed his. ways through the

Mothers who want their chil-

In urging people to enter the
political profession, Kennedy
stated, “It is the difference be-

_ A, ﬁred’-up Panther basketball team won their second
straight Steel: Bowl tournament. One word describes the

‘;_Panthers performance. TREMENDOUS!

 _ No‘ one man stood out in the Panthers winning cause.
-Each player turned in sparkling performances.‘ Little. Billy

handling left nothing to be desired.'He sparked the Pan-

 besides being good under the boards displayed some‘

games as he came through with key baskets when they
1 needed them. "

Here’s the way the scoring wentamong. the ﬁrst ﬁve‘;
Fridley and Falenski, 29, Mauro, 28, Sankey, 25, ,Mills, 24.
With such an even scoring attack St. Johns and Duquesne
could not defend one man. One Panther would be hitting
and then when he cooled off another would start. It was
truly a team victory of the Panthers, _ '

A. Let's not overlook‘ the ﬁne job of coaching that Bob}
Timmons turned in. The Panthers used’ zone against St.
-Johns which kept their best players outside and when
the Panthers were down by 15 he put the all-court ‘press
onat the right time. Then against Duquesne the Panthers
switched to a pressing zone. 'When the Dukes ﬁnally
solved it they weretso far behind it didn't matter. any-
more. . ~

. Well what does the future now hold for the ungle Cats.
Last year the underdog Panthers captured the Steel Bowl

it is supposed to be under par. After watching them perform

, The Panthers were deﬁnitely up for the Steel Bowl.
They wanted to beat Duquesne in the worst way. But now
‘that the Steel Bowl is over, the season doesn’t end. They
- proved they can win if they want to and there is no reason
to, stop now. This Friday theywill meet a real good Boston
College team and over the holidays they travel to Buffalo

DECK THE HALLS,

When you think of" Christmas gifts you naturally think of

Marlboro cigarettes, -leading seller in'ﬂip-top box in all ﬁfty,

states—and if we annex Wales, in all ﬁfty-one-and if we annex
Lapland, in all ﬁfty—tWo. (This talk about annexing Wales and

« _ Lapland is, incidentally, not just idle speculation. Great Britain
. wants to trade Wales to the United States for a desert. "Great _
Britain needs a desert desperately on -account of the tourist

trade. Tourists are always. coming up to the Prime -Minister or»
the Lord Privy Seal,.or the Thane of Glamis, or like that and
saying, “I’m not knocking your country, mind you. It’s very
quaint and picturesque, etc., what with Buckingham Palace and
Bovril and Scotland Yard, -etc., but where’s your desertl”!
I - -

     

' it .   .  ~ _
\-   i ‘ ‘W   ‘ . .
‘ ~. tat were; your atarr/.3 " -

Before I forget, let me ‘point out that Scotland Yard, Britain’s
plain-clothes police branch, was named after Wally" Scotland and

Fred Yard who invented plain clothes. The American plain-

clothes force is called the F.B.I. after Frank B. Inchcliﬁ, who
invented ﬁngerprints. Before Mr. Inchcliff’s invention, every-
body’s ﬁngers were absolutely glassy smooth. This, as you may
imagine, played hob with the identiﬁcation of« newborn babies
in hospitals. From 1791 until 1904 no American parent ever
brought‘ home the right baby from the hospital. This later be-
came known as the Black Tom Explosion. ‘

(Butll digress. England, I was saying, wants to trade. Wales
for‘ a» desert. Sweden wants to trade Lapland for Frank B.
Inchcliff. The reasonis that Swedes to this day still don't have
ﬁngerprints. As a result, identiﬁcation of babies in Swedish
hospitals is so haphazard that Swedes ﬂatly refuse to bring
their babies home. There are, at present, nearly a half-billion
unclaimed babies in Swedish hospitals—some of them well over
eighty years old.) '

But I digress. Marlboro‘ is, of course, an ideal Christmas gift ‘

for your friends and loved ones who enjoy ﬁlter cigarettes. If,
on the other hand, your friends and loved ones like mildness
but don’t like ﬁlters, then you can’t go wrong with a carton of

_ Philip Morris. If "your friends and loved ones like a subtly

mentholated cigarette that combines refreshing taste with high
ﬁltration, then buy a carton of Alpines. (Alpines, incidentally,
are named after the late Albert G. Pine. Al Pine worked all his
life to invent a cigarette that would combine light menthol and
high ﬁltration, but alas he never succeeded. As by-products of
his research he did manage to invent the atom, the gooseneck
lamp and the cocker spaniel, but the lightly mentholated high
ﬁltration cigarette, alas, never. Now this dream is realized,
and what could be more ﬁtting than to pay tribute to this gal-
lant man by calling this cigarette Alpine?) @ 1959 M... s1,'..1.....

Maryland succeeded in getting
their revenge for last year’s loss
as, they handed the Panther Tank-
ers a 61-34 defeat in both teams
opening meet. But the score does
not tell the whole story, for the
Panther mermen were without
the services of three of their top

men. Co-captain Pat Fitzgerald,~

top butterﬂy man Tony Sarsﬁeld,
and freestyler Tony Tresser could
have been the diﬁerencevfor the
tankers. ‘

Jim Emert, was the outstanding
man for the Blue _,and Gold mer-
men as he captured a surprise
ﬁrst in the '50-yard freestyle.

Emert commented “It was even”
"a surprise to me. I didn’t actual-

ly "think I could go_ that fast.”
Emert also took a ﬁrst in the
100-yard -free style event, and an-
chored the Tankers winning free-
style _relay team.

Bart Haasphad the only other
ﬁrst for the Blue and Gold as he
paddeled his »way to victory in
the. 220-yard freestyle event. Haas
also swam on the winning 400-
yard freestyle relay team.

In the diving competition it was
a narrow victory for Maryland as
the Panthers’ Jerry Irwin came
in a very close second. Kevin cap-
tured a third for the Blue‘ and
Gold by turning in‘ a good per-
formance.

“We xcould have won the meet I

if we had had the services of the
entire squad,”’ commented coach
Ben Grady. Grady also‘ added
“We’re looking forward to our
next meet when we come up

first win of the season and Penn’s

ﬁrst loss. Earlier this year Penn
defeated Fordham, 6-3, a team
that the, Cats are scheduled to
meet next.

The Panthers constantly kept
their opponents off balance by hit-
ting the ball hard and playing
their positions well. Ralph Ma-
son started the Cats rolling by
gaining a 3-0 decision. over Bill
Outten in the ﬁrst match.

-Successive wins by Morry Oli-

‘ ver, 3-1, Butch Guthrie, 3-1',
Bill’ Hindel, 3-0, Paul Knouse,
3-0, and Jack Monchik, 3-1, put

the meet out of the reach of

Penn who managed to win the
last three matches.
