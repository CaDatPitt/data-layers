with a mas-
querade,” John

‘Fanny’ Plans New

Routine With Band

Maintaining the tradition of
“famous ﬁrsts” which it holds, the
University Band will stage another
of its mystery stunts between the
halves of the Southern Methodist

coach, has inferred.

Sally Brunson, C39, coed major;
Fanny, the Panther; Larry Orr,
C39, cadet major; and Ed Cart-
:vright’s Stompers.

the group, will be the speakers.

The smoker was arranged by the -L
Riﬂes social committee under th
chairmanship of S. L. Loeb, BA41

oectations, a real show may be
expected. Hints have it that the

? <tunt is a burlesque of a very popu-

ar songlsimilar to the big apple

E vith which the band achieved
_ ration-wide prominence last year.

demic year 1939-1940.

' ' ' ‘ C
On Open Meetings

According toﬁastory‘ on pa_ge»_1 of ’_C0daY’S
paper, -Student,-Facu‘lty' Association will hold
its ﬁrst open meeting of theyear tonight.
An “urgent invitation,” we are told, has been
extended to all students and faculty members
to attend.   ' - _ ~

We, personally are very interested _to re-
ceive this‘ “invitation.” ~And » we think, it
might be ‘a good idea for some “outsiders to
take advantage of the offer to ﬁnd out what
student‘,g'0vernment is all about. « _

Many‘ important questions, no doubt, will
come up before‘ the SFA assembly, during
the course of the year. It is important that
the governing group haiidlesthese in an
open straightforward, manner.

Criticism has frequently been heard con-
cerning the alleged inactivity of SFA and
other 's'tude_nt -groups. It is also important
that students come around and see for”them-
selves whether or not these charges are true.

Werealize, of course, that SFA has been
holding open meetings for quite a while,
that today’s announcement comes as no
bombshell from the blue..But-"we think more
students and faculty members might come
around and see _for themselves.

Of course we know that a certain amount
of business, perhaps the majority must be
transacted behind the scenes. But we’re still
strong for open meetings.

Polish Artists Laud
Commons Hall Style

Among the closest copies of the original Gothic
styles to be found in America is the Commons Room,
according -to Mr. and Mrs. Waclaw Szymborski,
Polish painters who are decorating the Polish room
ceiling. .

Mr. and Mrs. Szyniborski are well qualiﬁed to
make such" a s'ta‘té’n‘ie‘rit for they ‘have studied and
painted in most of the European countries where the
authentic Gothic ﬂourished.

Sister and brother-in-law of Adolf Szyszko-Bohusz,
designer of the Polish room, the Szymborskis were
given leave of absenceby the Polish government in
order to come to Pittsburgh.

Restoration of old" canvases and painting of
churches is the work in which the Szymborskis have
specialized for many years.

Work of restoring old castles was begun by the
Polish government «immediately after the World war.
The castles were mostly twelfth century palaces of
the old Polish kings. Mr. and Mrs. Szymborski were
employed in repainting the tremendous ceilings of
the great halls in these castles before they came to
Pittsburgh. '

Neither of the Szymborskis, although well versed
in Russiap, German, French, and Finnish, besides
their native Polish, can speak English. All their
affairs in Pittsburgh are handled through the con-
sular secretary, Karol Herse.

Through Mr. Herse the Szymborskis stated their
appreciation of America and the modern American
art and culture. “Culture,” they said, “is the only
possible way out for the world.’’

Mrs. Szymborski studied at the St. Petersburg
Academy of Arts for two years prior to the World
War. She ﬁnished her training at the Academy of
Beaux Arts in Kracow. Mr. Siymborski also studied
at the Academy of Beaux Arts.

You Said It . . .

Dr. E. M. East, Harvard University:

“We ordinary people realize that we are not
geniuses, and we invent ii reason for not making
the grade that is soothing to our egos. Our nerv-
ous systems are sound and healthy. We are medi-
ocrities ‘because we are well-balanced and do
things like other people. All we needed to make
us geniuses was an inherited or acquired mental

“int. something that would have made our action;
Occentrie.”

Well the rest of you groundhogs can come out of

aged” Owl which depressed all rushees——for they

Military Campaigns of 1938

On page 59 of “The Battleﬁeld,” the Mary Wash-
ington yearbook appears the picture of Ann Rus-
sell Rooney rushed thricely by militarists McKenna,
Ellis, and Kairys while they were at Fort Monroe
last summer. Doris Jacobs, peachy sister of Bob
from the family. of the same name, has been seen re-
volving through our doors recently. ’Tis said that
Walt Cavalier who pinned Mary Junge is still dating
the lovely Doris. .

Pat Elmer came out from behind her seven veils

longer a secret.

in the Commons Room ﬁreplace are genuine for

Library Acquires  
‘Time Capsule ’ Book

Long years after the foot-a-year ivies have com-
pletely covered the towering sides of the Cathedral
the news ﬂashes of the day will feature a group of
sixtieth century archaeologists bringing to light a
long metallic capsule out of the shores of Flushing
Bay on Long Island sound.

That is the forecast of the latest acquisition of
the University’s library. The new book _is a dupli-
cate of one sealed in the Westinghouse Manufactur-
ing Company’s “Time Capsule.”

Buried on Equinox

At high noon last September 23, officials of the
Westinghouse Company buried their Cupaloy cylin-
der 50 feet under the center of the Westinghouse
pavilion at the New York World's Fair Grounds.
That special time and date were selected because it
was the exact moment of the Autumn Equinox. In
the capsule were only two books, the Holy Bible and
The Record of the Westinghouse Time Capsule.

The equivalent of 70 volumes is enclosed in the
form of microﬁlm. This is special movie ﬁlm which
must be viewed through a magnifying apparatus. A
magniﬁer was also enclosed.

Two reels of newsreel photos were also included,
with the idea that they would provide a brief
glimpse of twentieth century activity. Notable among
the other articles that were placed in the container
was a sample of a woman’s hat designed by a
famous designer.

Phonetic Key Included

The 50-page volume in the library contains a vivid
description of our life, given in terse, simple lan-
guage. Should the inhabitants of the earth no longer
have a knowledge of English at that time, a “Key to
the English Language” is included with the purpose
of introducing our language, to them. In the “Key”
all words are spelled in phonetical style.

Instructions are given for determining, by latitude
and longitude, the exact position where the capsule
was embedded. Since it is expected that the capsule
may do some “wandering” in the loose, marshy sub-
soil of Flushing Meadows, instructions are given for
locating it by electrical dividing rods. Further in-
structions for sinking cassions are given, in the
eventuality that it might “wander" out to sea.

The edition of the book was very limited, and it
is not expected that a similar edition will be pub-
lished. The present edition is a special one made to
last, under normal storage conditions, for 5000
years.

' just that.

History Lecturer Stresses
Pennsylvania's Importance

Attitudes of historians in re-
in Western Pennsylvania history
were discussed by Dr. Leland Bald-
win, lecturer in history, Friday in
Carnegie music hall. He spoke be-
fore the afternoon session of the
Western Pennsylvania Educational
Conference.

The classicist believes that any-
thing that happened after the fall
of Rome is not worth studying,
said Dr. Baldwin while most Amer-
ican historians look down upon the
study of local history.

According to Dr. Baldwin, “If
a city is not conscious of its past
. . . . it is ill at ease, and western
Pennsylvania has been accused of
Pennsylvanians have

contributed much to American his-
tory but they are not conscious of
it. Consciousness, which we lack,
is essential for cultural maturity.”

This apathetic attitude is begin-
ning to change. William and Mary
Darlington heralded this awaken-
ing by their work in recording and
preserving the history of this re-
gion. .

Especially signiﬁcant has been
the work of the Buhl Foundation
in establishing the Western Penn-
sylvania Historical Survey. After
ﬁve years of work a series of
twelve volumes dealing with the
history of this region was pub-
lished.

Alert Play Chief Factor

In Panthers Fourth Win   

 Panthers Score Four

T T ,. Times Against Badgers‘

There are any number of
ways by which a football

game may be won. Of course,
the best way is by scoring
.more touchdowns than
‘boys you.are playing against.

the

And the best method of accom-
plishing ‘this- is by playing smart

Because" they are brainy as well
as brawny, Pitt’s football Pan-
thers came back from the progres-
sive state of Wisconsin with a lib-
eral aggrandizement of scoring
points over‘ the ‘big, bad Badgers.

There.V;v.as. iio‘w.e.r...and. there was
speed in the Pitt offensive Satur-
day afternoon in Madison, which in
its own small way was one of the
accountable reasons for the 26-6
victory..

Badgers Big

But, the most salient reason was
the keenness. with which Pitt’.s
varsity moved around the Madison

ﬂﬁeld. It was an alert team, per-

forming in a heads-up manner that
was able to direct its way to four
«touchdowns over the exception-
ally’ virile Westerners.

Scout Johnny Michelosen brought
back the word that Struhelder’s
boys -.w.ere,big and t.0\.1gli,,w,hich is_
just the condition the Panthers
found them in Saturday. Except
they were also in more than a
ﬁghting mood, having reached a
psychological peak for the meet-
ing with unbeaten Pitt. This latter
situation was even more important
when it was observed that Pitt
was hardly “up” for the game.

Goldberg Scores

The Badgers smashed out from
the opening kick-off, and before
many playing minutes had passed
they were as close to the Pitt goal

_, 1i_ne as the ﬁrst__team Panthers has__

seen anyone this season. As a mat-
ter of fact, they were closer. They
were on the -16-yard mark before
it was indicated quite clearly that

~ they were to go n_o further.

The Panthers bounced back from
the ropes, however, and by the time
the second quarter had begun
Chickerneo was in position to give
the ball to Goldberg and tell him
to get those two yards for the
touchdown. This happened after
Cassiano’s 28-yard end run. Daddio
kicked through with the extra
point.

Petro Counts

Wisconsin still continued to play
ball. It was a kind of strong,
rugged ball, but from a strategic
point of view, it was scarcely com-
mendable. The Badgers would go
through the Pitt line for nice, sub-
stantial gains. Then, just when
they were ready to do something
effective, they would throw the ball
away. _ ’

Early in the third quarter Bellin
attempted to throw a ﬂat pass from
behind his goal. “This one is on
Wisconsin,” said Pitt guard Steve
Petro as he jumped up to grab it
and fall across for what was his
ﬁrst touchdown and Pitt's second
of the game. Daddio missed.

~ -Chickerneo Runs

In the fourth quarter the usually
conservative Chickerneo showed his
leftist tendencies when he ran from
punt formation towards the Wis-
consin goal line for a distance of
71 yards. This made it three touch-
downs for the Panthers.

The reserves kept their consecu-
tive scoring streak intact by com-
ing through with a touchdown im-
mediately following this Chick-
erneo dash. Naric threw to Thurbon
for a sum total of 70 yards gained.
Peace made good.

Wisconsin ﬁnally broke into the
scoring bracket with a touchdown
pass against Pitt’: third team 10
seconds before the game ended.
Jack Tennant threw to end Gody
Gil; for the score.

Capturing ﬁve of the ﬁrst six
places, the Pitt cross-countryteam
dunked the Navy thin-clads 17-38
on the Annapolis course last Fri-
day for the third successive
Panther win of the season.

Again Walter Sterner paced the
ﬁeld to the wire, hitting the tape
seventy yards ahead of Pitt man,
Al Zamborsky. Al Boulanger’s
third gave the Panthers a 1, 2, 3
ﬁnish.

J. C. Oldﬁeld took fourth for
Navy, but Frank McCabe and
Casimir Kopec continued the Pitt
monopoly with ﬁfth and sixth
places. Ben Kopec and Bill Nurmi
ﬁnished well down the list in
eleventh and twelfth slots but the
victory had already been iced away.

Women . Inquire

‘Where’s Elmer?’

Replacing ‘the traditional Coed
Prom, the Bal Mystic, a new event
for freshman women, wasvheld last
Wednesday evening in the ball
room of the Hotel Schenley.

The freshman women, accom-
panied by their mentors, were
dressed in summer formals, and
wore masks andVFrenc.h doll hats
fashioned from blue and gold crepe
paper. . .

At this event, Patricia Elmer,
C40, considered the most outstand-
ing woman in the junior class, was
featured as the Veiled Lady. She
remained veiled until the middle of
the evening, when two of her aides,
Mary Junge, C41, and Joy Hart-
man, C40, unveiled her and re-
vealed her name to the freshman
women.

Another feature of the evening
was the demonstration of the Lam-
beth Walk,’the new dance sensa-
tion, by Karl Heinrich, ballet mas-
ter of the Pittsburgh Civic Ballet.
He also led the Champagne Waltz,
assisted by a group of senior women.
In both of these dances, Roberta
Webb, Ed39, president of WAA,
the organization which sponsored
the Bal Mystique, was Mr. Hein-
rich’s partner.

Other aides of the evening were:
Betty Crowe, C40; Doris Weaver,
Cfll; Loisbelle Pryor, Ed41; Lillian
Zmsser, C40; and Nona Euwer,
C4_1. Peggy Hammond, C39, was
Mistress of Revels for the evening.

Cambridge Teacher

Reviews Victorians

“The rigid moral code and the
attitude towards women are the
most irritating faults in the lit-
erary works of the Victorians.” So
said Elizabeth Drew, faculty mem-
ber of Cambridge university, Fri-
day, to an audience in the Foster
Memorial.

Miss Drew spoke on “Some
Thoughts on Rereading the Great
Victorians.” The one notable ex-
ample of the evasion of the moral
code in literature of that day, ac-
cording to her, is Emily Bronte’s
novel, “Wuthering Heights.”

“The most important thing in
literature,” and here Miss Drew
quotes a deﬁnition of Henry J ames.
“is the amount of felt life the artist
has managed to read into his char-
acters and to communicate to the
readers.”

In this, Victorian literature suc-
ceeds over contemporary writings
because of its zest and vitality and
the combination of personal and
social force rather than one or the
other in present day writing.

“Modern writers are an exclusive
cult of exclusive people,” said Miss
Drew, “and it is to be hoped that
new genius will remedy this con-
dition.”

Fitzgerald Speaks
To Y Sophomores

YM-YWCA Sophomore Club met
last Thursday evening at 5:30
o'clock in the Y club rooms for an
organization meeting.

Rufus Fitzgerald, provost of the
University, assisted the group in
formulating its plans for the com-
ing year.

. . . Chesterfield writes it for
everybody who smokes ’em

It’s pleasure you smoke for . . .
everybody knows that . . . and
it’s pleasure you get in every

Chesterfield you light.

Chesterﬁelds are milder and better-
tasting and here’s the big reason . ..

It takes good things to make a
good product. In Chesterﬁeld we
use the best ingredients a cigarette
can have. . . mild ripe tobaccos and
pure cigarette paper.

Bookstore to Rent
Lockers to Students

Locker, locker, who’s got a lock-
er? “Not us,” say the students.
“Not us,” says the University book-
store, “at least, not at present, but
350 new lockers will be ready for
use at the end of October.”

A second locker room is under
construction on the ground floor,
directly below the bookstore. Un-
like the first locker room, the new
one will have a cemented floor. It
will be of the same type as those
brought down from Alumni and
State halls.

The University purchasing de-
partment is securing the lockers,
and the bookstore will rent them
for the treasurer’s oﬂice. They will
be available at one dollar apiece,
without lock, and at $1.70, lock in-
cluded, according to B. A. Murphy,
manager of the bookstore. There
are no restrictions on the number
of persons using a single locker.

 

Pittsburgh Business

Remains Constant

After a period of gradual up-
swing, business in the Pittsburgh
district leveled off last week, ac-
cording to the index of business
activity released by the Univer-
sity’s Bureau of Business Research.

All factors of business for the
week of October 8 averaged 72.4
per cent. For the preceding week,
the index reading was 72.3.

Trade registered the only change
of any consequence, dropping al-
most two points to 92.4.

A year ago, the index was more
than 30 points higher, the adjusted
index being 104.9.
