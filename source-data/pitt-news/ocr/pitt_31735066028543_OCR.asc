Call it Edgar Allen Poe meets Vincent Van Gogh.

The space occupied for years by Roy Rogers will
now not only contain fast—food chicken restaurant
Chic-fil—A and a deli with vegetarian items.

It will also feature a recently uncovered work of
art which was hidden for years behind the kitsch cov-

ered walls of ‘Roy Rogers.

Construction is now underway in the basement of l
the Cathedral of Learning for a new dining facility.
This $800,000 renovation project is expected to be

completed by early November.

This new dining area, called Cathedral Cafe, will
be operated by Sodexho, the French company that

Pitt students who walk through the
basement of the Cathedral of Learning
between classes are beginning to
notice something new in the air, and
it’s not a bird or a plane or even
Superman.

It's the aroma of coffee.

Fresh coffee.

Starbucks Coffee.

On Friday, Sept. 26, Starbucks
Coffee opened a new shop located in
the Cathedral basement, near the ele-
vators. The coffee shop is manned by
Sodexho employees, who operate all
other food service spots on campus. So
far, students have found the new coffee
shop to be a welcome change.

Pittsburgh Project brings

300+ students together
to clean upOakland

Lisa Di Renzo
Staff Writer

Pitt student Jaimee Mamer spent
her Saturday carrying a trash bag full of
leaves, cigarette butts and_ chewed—up
gum while digging through the bushes
on the Bigelow side of the William Pitt
Union.

Believe it or not, she volunteered to
do it. . .

She was one of many Pitt students
who gave up their Saturday afternoon to
participate in the Pittsburgh Project, an
SGB-sponsored service event aimed at
cleaning up Oakland one day a year.

"The main thing we're cleaning up
here are cigarette butts,” said Mamer, a
non-smoker. “It's really gross."

Mamer, who is the service chair of
Lambda Sigma, Pitt's sophomore honor
society, worked with other members of
Lambda Sigma to fulﬁll their monthly
service activity.

This is the second consecutive year
that Mamer participated in the
Pittsburgh Project.

"Last year we went to the YMCA,"

' said Mamer. "This year I get a chance to

get out on the streets and clean. It's a lot
of hard work."

The Pittsburgh Project lasted from
11 a.m. until 4 p.m. on Saturday, attract-
ing nearly 350 Pitt students who worked
at 29 sites, ranging from Schenley Park
to sites along Boulevard of the Allies.

Some other clean-up sites included
the Veteran's Administration Hospital
and Forbes and Fifth Avenues, accord-
ing to Lisa Caplan and Alyson Wallach,
the Pittsburgh Project committee co-
chairs.

The students who volunteered were
separated into groups of about 20. Each
group had a crew leader from either the
SGB, Student Volunteer Outreach, the
Blue and Gold Society, or an indepen-
dent leader, according to Caplan and
Wallach.

Students who volunteered in the
Project picked up trash, repaired houses
and planted ﬂowers along the streets of
Oakland. They also handed out campus

During preliminary demolition,
contractors exposed a mural entitled

within one of the walls.

No one at Food Services is sure
when this mural was made or why it
was covered and forgotten, but Food

guessed that the same

According to Sallade—Farina, how-
ever, the big win for students is that
they can use Dining Dollars at the new
vendor. Because the space will be oper-
ated by the same company that handles
the rest of Pitt's food services, and not
a separate proprietor as it was last year,
Food Services expects more students to
take advantage of the
new dining facility.

The kitchen for the cafe will be

more seating than Roy’s had to offer
and the floor will be carpeted.

In addition, Tom Kuester, the inte-
rior designer responsible for what
Sallade-Farina calls a "comfortable

Sallade-Farina complains that

are also accepted there.

In addition, at SGB's bonfire rally

packs with items such as razors and soap
to the patients at the Veteran's
Administration Hospital and participated
in the hospital's October Fest, according
to Jennifer Karch, the ﬁnance director for
the Pittsburgh Project.

The committee in charge of the ‘

Pittsburgh Project has been planning the
event since February. The committee

- coordinated ﬁnances, publicity and regis-

tration, and helped with donations of food
and T—shirts. '

Also, Michael Sandy of Student
Volunteer Outreach took care of getting

' things such as trash bags, gloves and

maps.

"If there's any emphasis that we want
to stress, it is that Student Volunteer
Outreach is just incredible and Mike
Sandy is outstanding," said Wallach.
"He's incredible at organizing and lead-
ing. He wants to help all these students
get out and volunteer."

‘Although only 336 students showed 9

up out of the the 800’ that registered,
Caplan says "this year's Pittsburgh
Project has been the most successful year

" as far as organization."

"We didn't have any last minute peo-
ple who were frazzled,” he added.
“Everything was here and people came to
set up."

According to Caplan and Karch,

_ Student Activities, Giant Eagle, Cameron

Coca-Cola, Sodexho, Bell Atlantic,
Student Volunteer Outreach and’ the
Student Organization Resource

Center(SORC) donated everything for

the Pittsburgh Project except for ads
appearing in The Pitt News and a sound
system used to instruct volunteers.

"We ran under budget," said Karch.‘

"The sound equipment rental was
between $150 and $200. Because of the
expense of the Pitt News ads, it was prob-
ably under $700." ’

Also, Michael Sandy and Laura
Sproat, who ran registration, got the
Pittsburgh Project online and implement-
ed e—mail registration as well as setting up
registration tables at the Union.

"E-mail registration saved us a lot of
time," said Adam Neary, the publicity
director for the Pittsburgh Project.

"We might shoot for it again next
year because of how well it went," added
Wallach.

Many of the students who volun-
teered were enthusiastic and enjoyed
themselves.

Esrick O. McCartha, president of the
Diamond Club, which is a Pitt student
organization that provides insight to stu-
dents interested in self-development and
community outreach, picked up trash on
Bates and Fifth Avenues with sisters from
Chi Omega sorority. «

"We had a blast," said Ryan
Weidemniller, the SGB member who
headed this site group. "They enjoyed
each other and I enjoyed having them. It
was a great time."

the coffee vending machine, which
doesn't always work," said senior

Denise Foster.

Many other students feel the same
way. At any time during the day,
someone passing through the base-
ment will see lines of students waiting
to get some of the many Starbucks
goodies, such as its coffee of the day,
an espresso or perhaps one of the
many pastries it offers.

"Business has taken off much bet-
ter than we thought," supervisor Chris

_ Ridley said, "and most students are
«. not even aware of everything we

offer."
In addition to coffee, Starbucks

FROM PAGE 1

offers candy bars, pastries and biscot—
ti——which are sure to satisfy many
students’ sweet teeth.

For those who need more than
candy, Starbucks offers fresh salads,
gounnet sandwiches and many vari-
eties of specialty wraps — sandwich-
es wrapped in a ﬂavored tortilla.
There are vegetarian food items as
well.

You can even get your own
Starbucks Mug filled with coffee for
$5.50. The mug can be refilled for
$1.00.

One of the only items Starbuck
doesn't carry is iced coffee. ‘

"We don't carry iced drinks yet,

but once construction is over they will
be available in the deli section of
Chick-fil-A," said Ridley. j

Even without iced drinks, stu-
dents are content to stand in line for
cafe au lait or cappuccino. Students
are even more willing to overlook the
minor inconvenience when they hear
that Starbucks accepts Dining Dollars
and Campus Funds.

‘'1 love coffee and being able to
use Dining Dollars to get it is the best
part," said sophomore Rachel
Bertges.

Starbucks in the Cathedral is open
7 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Monday through
Thursday, 7 am. to 6 p.m. on Friday
and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday. For
October, however, special Saturday

Give Towers a chance - they ain't bad

Jennifer Stoltz

 

Oakland residents: Give
a hoot; don’t pollute

The Pittsburgh Project is a great idea, and we
applaud all the people who got involved.

On the other hand, it shouldn’t even have to exist.

It’s really a shame that students living in Oakland
won’t take care of their lawns, and the sidewalks just in
front of their houses and apartments.

South Oakland is especially disgusting. Only two
days after the clean-up, the place is already beginning
to look like a landﬁll. There is actually garbage in the
trees.

Long-terrn Oakland residents take better care of

their neighborhood. They do it because it’s theirs. They

don’t care to live in a dump. It doesn’t make any sense
that students would want to live in a dump. Is the year
that the average apartment lease lasts not long enough
for them to worry about what their neighborhood looks
and smells like? '

This isn’t just a matter of cleaning up. It would be
easier just not to litter. Carry your trash the extra block
to a trash can. Don’t put garbage out in broken bags or
overﬂowing cans.

And try using ashtrays.

Having an apartment in Oakland is most students’
ﬁrst experience of really being on their own; not just
away from home, but having to take care of their own
space. They often don’t have meal plans to fall back on,
and they have to make sure they have enough money at
the end of every month to pay the rent check and utili-
ty bills. It is a lot of responsibility.

But if you’re going to take on that responsibility,
you should do it all the way. Treat it like it’s your house,
like it’s your neighborhood.

One would expect that when students have matured
sufﬁciently and are living in their own homes with a
spouse, 2.4 children and a dog, they will be responsible
enough to take care of their investments, and to keep
their neighborhoods clean, if not just for the aesthetic
appeal, then for their children’s sake.

While all that may not sound like an issue right
now, this is the best time to start learning how to deal
with the responsibility. College is a time for growing
up. So let’s at least start acting our age.

columnlst

I really wish students would
quit complaining about the Towers.
They are not nearly as bad as
they’re made out to be. According
to some students, living in the
Litchﬁeld Towers is right up there
with taking a Quantum Physics
ﬁnal on the first day of class. Either
that, or being forced to walk on hot
coals.

When you think ‘‘college
dorm,” what comes to mind? A
small, cramped room in which you
spend much of your college life
and which holds most of your
worldly belongings. Emphasis on
small. The Towers shouldn’t be a
big shocker in that department. It’s

.a universal theme on all college

campuses. Almost every university
is strapped for space. So why do
people expect to arrive to luxuri-
ous, spacious living quarters?
Beats me.

Many of those who wanted to
avoid the rumored “wra ” of the
Towers applied for housing in
Sutherland. As everyone knows by
now, they arrived on campus only
to ﬁnd out that their comfortable
four-student suite now was home
to eight or nine. Admittedly, I was
almost one of them. Halfway
through the summer, I went
through what some would label a
ﬁt of insanity and actually request-
ed ‘to live in the Towers. There
were several reasons why.

For one, I did it because of the
number of people. Hundreds upon
hundreds of people live here. The
majority of freshmen are placed
here. It’s an automatic social
engine, as anyone who has spent
time in the Towers lobby knows.

It’s buzzing down there practically
24/7. Meeting people has been so
much easier here, since we’re all in
the same place. .

For two, there’s the closeness.
While the cramped spaces and thir-
ty or so people to a bathroom are a
pain at times, it can also prove to be
a good thing. We’re all going
through the same thing, this new
experience of being out on our
own, but we’re not facing it alone.
I like to have a person right down
the hall to talk to, or down a couple
ﬂoors to hang out with.
Sometimes, the phone just isn’t
good enough, but all it takes is a
few steps and you can pour your
heart out face-to-face.

Third, I like the convenient
location. Everything is right here.
The Towers has the mail room,
Eddie’s, a cafeteria and a laundry
room. We’re right in the middle of
campus, and rolling out of bed ﬁf-
teen minutes before class isn’t the
end of the world. It is possible to
make it on time to many lecture
halls. Anything else is only a few
minutes away. I realize other resi-
dence halls have special features,
but any student would have to
admit, the Towers are home to a lot
of the _day to day University action.

On numerous occasions I have
been witness to Towers—bashing.

Once, I was engaged in a typical;

freshman-to-freshman conversa-
tion. You know, “Where are you
from, what’s your major,” the
usual. Then, I was asked, “So
where are you living?” When I
answered the Towers, she replied,
“Oh, god, I’m so sorry. How in the
world do you handle it?” My
answer was the same one I give
everyone. I tell them that it’s not as
bad as it seems, and that it’s typical

THE PITT NEWS

for college life. It comes with the
tenitory.

The Towers are a good starting
point for someone who is living
away from home for the first time.

. Face it, our closet—sized rooms are

a lot easier to keep clean, even if
they are cluttered. And all the rea-
sons I listed above make it easier
for someone as clueless as me. I’m
an only child, and beforecollege,
the longest I had ever been away
from home was a week in North
Carolina for forensics nationals. If
anyone should have had a problem
with living in the Towers, it should
have been me. I could have easily
been lost, dumbfounded or exces-
sively overwhelmed by it all. But,
that has not been the case. At least
not more than any other person.
I’m not going to sing the
Towers’ praises to no end, or say
that they’re that much better than
all the other residence halls at Pitt.
Like anything, they have their ups
and downs, good points and bad
points. If people would just look at
the situation with open minds, and
not with pre-conceived notions,
they’d be a lot better oﬁ. Here’s the
way I see it: College is meant to be
a learning experience, where you
ﬁgure out what you want out of a
career, out of life. It is not a place to
become totally obsessed with the
square footage of your room. Take
it at face value, and spend your
time and effort on more important
matters. Remember, you’re not the
only one dealing with it, and it’s far
from the end of the world. Do
yourself a favor, and quit com-
plaining. You’ll be better off for it.

Jennifer Stoltz wrote this while sit-
ting in her “Castle Suite ” in Tower
A.

University staff could use a course in customer relations

Dan
Ertman

In the short while that I’ve been at
Pitt, one thing has become blatantly
clear to me: The office employees of
basically every University department
that I’ve dealt with are  how to put
this mildly  completely incompetent
idiots. ‘

Now, I am sure that there are some
competent individuals out there some-
where, but I have yet to see them.
Perhaps the idiots I have to deal with
have tied them up in some dark corner.

I suppose I should explain this
anger. So far, on three separate occa-
sions, Pitt ofﬁce personnel, salespeo-
ple, etc., have managed to thoroughly
screw things up for me. They have to
be either misinformed, poorly trained
or just plain stupid.

I’ll start with the most unbeliev-
able occurrence. Around June, the

. Housing Office was kind enough to

inform those of us who are in-
University Housing of our roommates
for this year. Apparently, some changes
were still in the works when they sent
those mailings, because my letter said
that my roommate’s name was Craig
Szygenda (Craig, if you exist, call
me!), a student from the middle of

Pennsylvania. I was therefore very sur-
prised when a letter arrived in August
from Bill Black, who claimed that he
was my roommate.

Hmmmn.

Well, I called the Housing Office,
and was informed by a pleasant-sound-
ing recorded message that the ofﬁce
hours were between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m.
I.actual1y woke up early the next mom-
ing to call them, and was promptly put
on hold for thirty minutes, after which
time one of their employees was able

-to determine that my roommate was

indeed Bill Black, and that there were
some kind of eraser marks under his
name which faintly resembled Craig
Szygenda.

“Couldn’t you have found it in
your hearts to send me some kind of
notification of the change?” I asked.

“I’m sorry, sir, but we thought the
mailing was correct when it went out.”

“Oh, I see. So you had no plans to
double check the assignments?”

“No sir, we do not normally do
that.”

The second incident involves the

Resnet people. In their infinite wis-.

dom, they decided to send the
“Computer Truck Load Reservation
Forms” by second class mail. I, being a
Chicago native, received my form,

which was due Friday, Aug. 8, on
Monday, Aug. 11. I immediately
rushed over to my nearest library and
faxed the form in. I then called them,

just to make sure they got it safe and

sound.

“Oh, yes,” theivoice on the phone
assured me, “We got that this morning
through the fax.”

Lo and behold, when I went to the
Resnet desk, charge card in hand, to
pay for my Ethernet card, the employ-
ees informed me that my reservation
simply did not exist.

Errr.

He further informed me that I
would have to wait until all of the
reserved units had been sold, to see if I
could buy mine.

Double errrr.

And then, just today, my first
phone bill arrived. I was rather unsure
of whatI was being “billed” for. After
all, every brochure the STS ofﬁce had
given me, and all of the information
that the lady working the desk had,
claimed that the $25 dollar check I
made out would be recorded as a cred-
it to my account, and that I would even
get a $5 bonus for signing up early.
None of this, as it turned out, was false.
However, as it turns out, there is a mys-
terious $25 “access fee,” which is not

documented anywhere in any of the
information. So I rushed over to the
STS office, intent on proving my case
and getting my money back, only to
find  a locked’ door. “Office hours:
8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.,” the sign reads.

Triple errr. _

So here’s what I feel needs to be
done.

1. All office employees should be
fully trained, fully versed professional
individuals. I make no further com-
ment about what they are now.

2. All fees should be public, all
paperwork should be done and all
changes should be passed on to the stu-
dents. ' ’

3. How about some longer office
hours? No business on the planet could
stay alive with the hours our University

maturity from
student leaders

The recent claims against SGB
members have left me, and other stu-
dents I’m sure, angry and embarrassed
that such individuals have squandered
funds. Like many freshmen, I am new
to the city of Pittsburgh and college life
in general. Maybe I’m-wrong,‘but I’ve
always thought students in authority
positions should behave in a responsi-
ble, mature fashion. Surely the mem-
bers of SGB were not behaving respon-
sibly when the infamous photo that
graced the cover of The Pitt News was
taken.

Being new to Pitt, this revelation
has left me wondering what happens to
students’ numerous fees. It seems as if
the funds are not being handled correct-
ly. Clearly, certain members of SGB
thought the only work they would
engage in would be partying.
Hopefully, those individuals who so
carelessly handled their authority posi-
tions will be promptly removed from
further “service.”

I am shocked and dismayed that so

~much student money has been wasted

and handled so irresponsibly. I applaud
the entire Allocations Committee for its
prompt resignation due to this contro-

Old men who flirt
are sometimes

just being nice

I can’t remember the name of the
lady who wrote the column about age
and dating, but she makes a good
point! However, speaking for my fel-
low middle—agers, most of us are just
friendly old gentlemen who’s only
ulterior motive is to brighten some-
one’s day. We are mostly a pretty
harmless lot. We do notmean to come
across as a “come on,” and our
attempts to be kind are sometimes rnis—
taken because we are clumsy with our
words.

Nevertheless, it was a good point '

she made, and I’m glad she made it!

Students are misled
. about campus
safety by omissions

I hope you all received your For
Safety’s Sake newsletter in your mail-
boxes. For those of you who didn’t
bother to glimpse at it for a brief
moment, let me fill you in on what you
missed.

It included information on safety
and security, crime, sexual assault and
other important_issues here at Pitt. The
parts of literature that struck me like a
bolt of lightning were the paragraphs
about parking.

It said that “Pitt continues to
upgrade security in parking areas” and
that “lighting continues to be improved
where needed.” Obviously, something

'was not done right with either the

lighting or the upgrade of security in
the OC lot, where my car was broken
into.

I was shocked and furious when I
discovered the damage to my car, but
relieved that the pathetic person(s)
who tried to steal it were unsuccessful
in their attempt. Mind you, I pay $480
per academic year to keep my car in a
lot that is obviously unsafe. After the
incident, I was told by the Parking and
Transportation Department that the OC
lot is not designed for overnight park-
ing, and was advised not to keep my
car there overnight. I think it was a lit-
tle too late for the advice at that point,
but thanks anyway.

I feel compelled to inform you of
my story since it was not included in
the Campus Police Blotter of The Pitt
News. Instead, you were informed that
a “marijuana pipe was confiscated on
the seventh ﬂoor of Tower B” (much to
our surprise) and that “an individual
was approached by campus police at
10:54 p.m. for throwing food at the
WPU house manager.” Don’t get me
wrong, I find the Campus Police
Blotter amusing at times, but there are
serious matters happening here at Pitt
of which the students should be
informed. Continue informing us of
the childish acts, but don’t forget the
serious issues like automobile theft.

Loss isn’t the
end of the world
  or the season

After Pitt’s disappointing 17-13 loss
to Temple on Saturday, most Pitt fans
joined together in an all—out Pitt-bashing
bitch session.

These Panther fans gathered in bars
and called in on radio talk shows, pro-
claiming things like “Pitt sucks” and
“They’re back at ground zero like they
were last year.”

Relax.

Yes, the Temple game was pathetic.
Yes, Pitt lost an important conference
game that it could have and should have
won. Yes, the Owls ran the ball with case
against a lackluster Panther defense that
had 15 days to prepare for the contest.

But it’s only one game in an 11—garne
season. Flash back to August before the
season started. Any Pitt fan would be
thrilled to think that we’d be 3-2 ﬁve
games into the season.

Had the Panthers lost to Miami and
beaten Temple, they’d be 3-2 and 1-1 in
the Big East -—~ exactly like they are now
— and the overall tone surrounding Pitt
football would be optimistic. This current
Pitt-bashing craze would be replaced by
praise for the team’s winning record.

We all got carried away with thoughts
of a major bowl and competing for the Big
East title. We know that’s not realistic;
we’re not that good yet. But that doesn’t
mean we can’t compete for one of the
sought-after second- through fourth-place
spots in the conference, which are guaran-
teed a bowl bid.

Pitt’s season is not lost. The humiliat-
ing loss to Temple should not take away
from this team’s early—season accomplish-
ments.

Even if the Hurricanes aren’t the team
we all thought they were, they still have a
hell of a lot of talent Pitt’s victory was still
a major accomplishment for the program.

Losing to Temple two years ago was a
sin. Losing to the 1997 version of the‘ Owls

Harris talks Temple, Notre
Dame at weekly conference

Brett Stein

For The Pitt News

There weren’t any
excuses this week at Pitt
Head Football Coach Walt
Harris’ press conference.

“Somebody has to win,
somebody has to lose. I can
handle losing, but we need to
fight,” Harris said of Pitt’s
17-13 loss to Temple on
Saturday.

Harris said the team that
showed up at Temple was
not the same team of the pre-
vious four weeks.

“This was a devastating
loss for us. We had a lot of
smoke blowing up our uni-
forms from the Miami win,

Harris, in his first meet-
ing with the media since the
postgame conference at
Veterans Stadium, suggested
that the team needed more
leadership from its seniors.

He said that the team’s older 1

players should be giving out
pats on the back instead of
yelling at their younger
teammates.

“It’s part of the learning
process,” Harris said when
asked how the loss would
affect the team’s underclass—
men.

Harris said Pitt had trou-
ble with Temple’s man—to—
man defense, which would
explain Pitt’s lowest offen-
sive output this season. He

By nature, cross-country races are

were even longer than usual for the Pitt
men’s and women’s teams.

fare much better, placing 26th out of 31
teams with 717 points.

North Carolina State dominated the

“I.osingawed<oftraining[d11etoan

There was a 24-second gap between

Raymer was 168th in 20:50.

“Some of the underclassmen have

The battle between the Atlanta Braves
and Florida Marlins has raged all season,
and after first-round sweeps of Houston and
San Francisco, respectively, the two clubs
are once again ready to clash, this time for
a National League pennant.

Starting Pitchers - The Marlins have one
of the league’s best starters in Kevin Brown
(16-8. 2.69), but the Braves have four of the
league’s best pitchers.

Greg Maddux, Denny Neagle, John
Smoltz and Tom Glavine combined for 68
wins and make up the best starting rotation
in baseball. Smoltz’s minuscule 3.02 ERA
was the highest of the Braves’ four aces,

A Mack are a couple of impressive running
‘ backs, and sophomore quarterback Kevin

Harvey could develop into a top—notch
option quarterback.

Like the Panthers, Temple has a legit-
imate shot at a fourth-place ﬁnish in the
Big East. With the way that Big East teams
have played this year, anything is possible.

Virginia Tech was supposed to be the
only dominant team in theconference. But
on Saturday, the Hokies lost to Miami of
Ohio, a team widely considered to be a
second-tier Division I school.

Other Big East rivals, including West
Virginia and Syracuse, appear indestruc-
tible one week and look like pushovers the
next.

\V1th games remaining against all

three of these teams — as well as contests

with Rutgers, Boston College and a strug-
gling Notre Dame — the Panthers have a
legitimate chance of winning their fair
share of ball games.

They won’t win them all, but if they
could win half of them, despite the dam-
aging loss to Temple, a bowl game is still
within reach. Fan support, not criticism,
could be the extra push the Panthers need
to edge out their fellow Big East con-
tenders. -

Before you go and knock the

— Panthers, just remember the land of things

expected of this football team. Keep in
mind the talent level found on this team,
and keep in mind the performance that
Walt Harris manages to bring out of these
players.

We should focus on the fact that Pitt
still has a very realistic shot at locking up
a top-four spot in the conference and
reaching a bowl game. Whether or not we

we are even in contention for a bowl game
is far more than anyone could have hoped

Braves, Marlins batllefor the National League pennant

and the foursome owns collectively six Cy
Young awards. Neagle could pick up a sev-
enth this year.

Alex Fernandez, the Marlin’s No. 2
starter, put together a good season with his
17-12 record and a 3.50 ERA, but he strug-
gled late in the year (0-3, 5.23 in
September). Al Leiter and Livian
Hemandez round out a solid rotation for

. Florida, but no rotation compares to the

Braves.
Advantage: Atlanta

First Base - The Marlins will platoon
Darren Daulton and Jeff Conine in an
attempt to gain any advantage they can
against the Braves’ pitching. The left—hand-
hitting Daulton will play against Smoltz

and Maddux, with Conine facing lefties
Glavine and Neagle.

Fred McGri1f is not the power threat he
once was; his 22 homers and are not
enough to match the Marlin platoon.
Advantage: Florida

Second Base - Long-time Brave Mark
Lemke hit just .245 with 26 RBI this sea-
son, but is an excellent ﬁelder and remains
the starter. But Keith Lockhart also sees a
lot of action at second.

The Marlins’ Kurt Abbott is also steady
in the ﬁeld, but he’s put up better offensive
numbers than Lemke.

Advantage: Florida

Shortstop - Jeff Blauser remained among

   

9

the league leaders in hitting all season and
has kept it going in the postseason, hitting
.300 in the Houston series. The speedy Alex
Renteria stole 32 bases this season, but he
hit just .150 in Florida’s sweep of the
Giants.

Advantage: Atlanta

Third Base - Veteran slugger Bobby
Bonilla compiled solid 1997 stats for
Florida (.297, 17 HR, 96 RBI) and hit .333
in the San Francisco series.

Chipper Jones put up similar numbers
during the regular season and has hit a
whopping .500 so far this postseason. It’s
close, but Jones is one of the game’s rising

young stars and has a slight edge over the

Advantage: Atlanta r
Left Field - Moises Alou was the Marlins’
best player this season. He hit .292 and had
23 home runs and 115 RBI, while also
making ﬁne diving catches in left ﬁeld.
Ryan Klesko has a lot of pop in his hat, but
he is not the complete package that Alou is.
Advantage: Florida

FROM PAGE 9

Center Field - Flon'da’s Devon White did
not put up his typical numbers this season;
he hit just .245 and swiped only 13 bases.

Kenny Lofton came to Atlanta in a
six—player deal at the beginning of the sea-
son and has done nothing but produce. He
stole 27 bases and picked up 164 lnts on
his way to gamering a .333 average, to go
with his amazing defensive skills.
Advantage: Atlanta

' Right Field - The Braves feature two

promising young players in their right-
ﬁeld platoon. The left-hand—hitting
Michael Tucker hit .283 and smacked 14
homers, while his counterpart, Andruw
Jones, compiled a .231 average and hit 18
home runs.

Despite having an off-year, Marlins
right ﬁelder Gary Sheffield is still one of
the most dangerous hitters in baseball. He
has the power to drive the ball deep and is
a tenacious clutch hitter (.556 average in
the playoff series against the Giants).
Advantage: Florida

Catcher - Both teams feature outstanding
young catchers. The Marlins’ Charles
Johnson is perhaps the league’s best at
throwing out runners, but Atlanta’s Javier
Lopez is also a tremendous hitter, compil-
ing a .296 average in the regular season.
Advantage: Atlanta

Bullpen - Florida’s Robb Nen is the best
closer in the National League. He tallied
35 saves, nine wins and a 3.89 ERA, and
his fastball ﬂirts with 100 mph. Mark
Wohlers isn’t far behind Nen, and he has a
better supporting cast in Alan Embree,
Brad Clontz and Mike Bilecki.
Advantage: Atlanta

Florida is a good team, but if the
Marlins cou1dn’t catch the Braves in 162
games, there’s no reason to think they’ll be
able to beat them in seven.

Prediction: Atlanta in six games.

HARRIS

also mentioned that the offensive line
was inconsistent at times.

Most questions dealt with Pitt play-
ers, with one notable exception -
Harris was asked why he opted to kick
the ball downﬁeld instead of going for
an onside kick at the end of the game.
This is a question he may have to
answer many times, because Pitt failed
to get the ball back from Temple’s
offense.

“I thought we could pin them back
when we kicked off in an obvious
onside situation,” Harris said. He
acknowledged that the move backﬁred
after Temple gained nine yards on its
ﬁrst play following the kick.

FROM PAGE 8

“Most people who study the game I

would say we had a letdown,” said
Harris.
Redshirt senior Reggie Thomas

didn’t agree, saying he wasn’t sure why ‘

Pitt came out ﬂat but that theteam did-
n’t have a letdown.

“We focus on every game individu-
ally —— one game at a time. It’s hard to
say what happened. We didn’t come to
play,” Thomas said.

The senior center has been both-
ered by injuries this season — he
missed the Temple game with an
injured knee — but said he’ll be ready
to go against Notre Dame.

Harris noted that defensive lineman
Frank Moore, who also missed the
game against Temple, is doubtful for
this weekend’s contest.

After discussing the Temple game,
Harris turned to the upcoming contest
against Notre Dame.

“I’m very impressed with Notre
Dame. They are bigger and stronger
than us. We’re going to have to fight,”
Harris. said.

The coach addressed one of

Pittsburgh’s favorite sons as well, say-
ing he approved of Irish quarterback
Ron Powlus’ efforts so far.

“To have as much pressure as Ron
Powlus has had, I think he’s performed
extremely well this season,” Harris
said.

Harris noted that both teams have
new coaches and then addressed Notre
Dame’s slow start. .

“We’re in our first seasons. Coach
Davie probably has the same growing
pains we have,” Harris said.
