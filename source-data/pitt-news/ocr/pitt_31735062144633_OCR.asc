PITT SENIORS TAKE
TESTS NEXT. WEEK

Carnegie Foundation Aims
To Get Attitudes Prevalent
On Courses

College achievement tests will be
given to all seniors of the University
Monday and Tuesday, under the su-
pervision of the Carnegie Founda-
tion for the Advancement of Teach-

ing. The tests are being given in
every college and secondary school
throughout Pennsylvania. Those
taking the examination will be ex-
cused from classes during the time
of the tests.

The tests will be given to all
seniors who expect to graduate in
June, under the direction of a com-
mittee appointed by the University.
They will be given in the banquet
room of Memorial Hall, beginning
Monday and continuing Tuesday from
8:30 until 11:30 o'clock in the mom-
in , and then from 1:30 to 4:30
o’c ock each afternoon.

Results of the tests will be tabu-
lated by the research education de-
partment, under the direction of Dr.
Walter Jones, after which they will
be scored under the direction of the
Carnegie foundation and the results
compared with those obtained in
other Pennsylvania‘ schools. The
committee in charge of the testing
is Dr. S. B. Linhart, secretary of
the University, chairman; Dr. Jones,
Dean Grover H. Alderman, of the
school of education, and Dr. Chester
Buckner, head of the department of
secondary education.

The information gathered is to be
used for statistical purposes only so
as to aid the educational depart-
ment in the development of a better
system for conducting higher learn-
ing. -The tests are strictly conﬁ-
dential. _

The sui vey -will consist of the col-
lecting-of detailed information from
the student, a recording of all studies
pursued by the students, and the
holding of the general examinations.

In examining the college senior,

the foundation desires to know the
attitude of the student toward the
course and the school after he has
inspected his individual record. It
also wishes to know the student rat-.
ing in a standard test not so much
to test the individual but to put to
the test the entire educational sys-
tem in importantrespects. They will
show whether the college process at
Pitt is proﬁtably organized to serve
the needs of the students. The re-

University Pays Tribute To Chancellor I
.McCormicIz’s Sterling Characteristics

._ , "By HELEN SEKEY
Last week the University paid
tribute to Dr. Samuel Black McCor-
mick. An old man he seemed to us,
aman who had lived his three score
years and ten. Perhaps to many he
was known as just name; and,
perhaps, only ' from reading the
newspaper accounts of his death,_did
many learn of his active association
with the University.
A ‘Hardly anyone‘can be found who
had known the deceased Chancellor
in more situations than J. Steele
Gow executive secretary of the Uni-
ve ty, whose friendship began
through his parents, and continued
as a child, as a student, and, ﬁnally,
as executive of the University.
_ Upon graduation from the Theo-
logical Seminary, Dr. McCormick
had as his first pastorate the Cen-
. al ‘Presbyterian Church on the
, orth Side; and here the ﬁrst “knot”
be tied was for the mother and
father of . Ir. Gow. Mr. Gow was
himself am rig the first children to
be baptised by Dr. McCormick. _
' Knowing Dr. McCormick as he did,
Mr. Gow found that his chief charac-
teristic was his quickness of action.
Even until his death this trait clung
to him; he seemed to live in a hurry.

*,When.he called upon his parishion-

ers, he never rode the digniﬁed horse
I: ' that the other ministers

u
su "conveyance was too slow
9

. he, preferred -a _lp'cy¢1€-

 

Well ‘does Mr. Gow remember these
pastoral visits to his parents; he
can still recall the preacher, with

trousers clamped tight about his_

ankles, steaming up Sandusky street
to the Gow home. Nor did the
preacher take time to park his wheel
properly; down would fall -the bi-
cycle to the street as the rider swung
his leg to the sidewalk. Then he
would dash informally into the house
without waiting to have his knock
answered-—- or sometimes without
even waiting to knock——and in a few
minutes, dash out again, and start
off on another dash. And the con-
gregation liked this parson that was
always tearing off in a hurry,

Yet neither advancing age not ad-
vance to the position of Chancellor
slackened Dr. McCormick’s speed.
“Hustlin’, bustlin’ Sammy Mac,” he
was affectionately called. In his of-
fice he couldn’t sit still, it seemed;
he was continually moving from
corner to corner, to his desk, and
back again. He used to rush ad-
ministration, for he saw no reason in
delaying legislation of any kind.
The incident is yet remembered in
Heinz house-—how the chancellor and
the little maid together pounded out
a letter “hunt and hit method” when
the secretary was away.

“Without industry there can be no
creative writing, no production of
‘objets d’art’~ and no means of edu-
cating the youth,” stated A. E.

Huckins at the eighteenth annual.
banquet of the downtown stu'dents’V—'

association of the University Satur-

ay.
,Mr. Huckins, a graduate of the

University of Illinois, stressed the.

importance of self-education plus a
school education.
man gets two educations; one that
is given" to him and one that he
gives to himself.”

Chancellor John G. Bowman spoke
of the ever increasing necessity for
choosing a vocation that combines
in itself the medium of se1f-expr.es-
sion and the means of gaining a live-
lihood. “Education,” he said, “is not
for the ultimate purpose of learning
how to make money but it is learn-
ing how to live.” “The university,”
said Chancellor Bowman, “should be-
the medium for the inspiration of
youth and for the development of
faith.”

The invocation was offered by Dr.
Samuel B. Linhart, secretary of the
University. Robert D. Ayars, of the
downtown division, was toastmaster.
Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, director of
the downtown division, gave a short
talk in which he told of the summer

Sherwin Gwinn, In “American Magazine,”

Calls Chancellor Bowman A “Crusader” '

“He is a crusader unfettered by
tradition, a blazer of new trails who
boldly has set his back to the
past,” writes Sherman Gwinn in an
article, “John Bowman's Fifty-Story
Dream," which appears in the May
issue of the American Magazine.

Mr. Gwinn describes Pittsburgh as
it was in 1921, the year that Dr.
Bowman came to the University, as
a city with a single track mind-—a
mind of industry, steel, coal, oil and
lumber-—which offered adventure,
daring and wealth, and left little
initiative for education. “Pittsburgh
was one of the richest industrial dis-
tricts in the world, yet had a Uni-
versity which, for its enrollment,
was one of the most poorly sup-
ported. Pittsburgh was in need of
such a man as Dr. Bowman, a man
of intense enthusiasm and feeling,
who had built a reputation for
originality, for doing the difficult
and for driving force as an execu-
tive,” the article says.

City Was His Theater

“It was as a playright that Dr.
Bowman saw his problem,” says Mr.
Gwinn. The city was his theater;
the theme of education as typiﬁed by
the University was his play; the
play was not “going ovei-”—-the bulk
of the audience had walked out. The
play had to be written over again.

the vacant square of ground

_:,l_nesr, the foot: of the . old. University, says ‘in the interview.‘

‘:?r~

buinings as his stage, he started to
rewrite his play. “To catch. the

«spiritual, driving, courageous stun’; 
that made Pittsburgh—-that is what‘ i

he wished to do in this building that
he envisioned. It was to be. aca-

was to be the better life dramatized,
in stone,” writes Mr. Gwinn.

Put Over His Ideas . ‘

Chancellor Bowman met almost in-

surmountable obstacles when he
tried to sell his idea to the geoplo.
of Pittsbur h, he continues. ut-in‘

less than t ree months these same
people who before had been indif-
ferent, subscribed more than‘ ten
million dollars to the University.
The money came from the _ r and
the wealthy. From the stee worker,
the banker, florist, clerk, manufac-
turer and street cleaner—from
everyone interested in the futons

man's dream.”

Three factors mainly responsible
foh the tastes, the views and the
moral and intellectual levels of the
community are the home, the church

the community’s tastes are bad, if,

views are warped, if its intell '_ 
level is low, apd its colleges arezﬂtr,
supported, these three have 
their duty,” .. Chancellor I

In awarding certiﬁcates of attain-

of a satisfactory life and that the

certiﬁcates were prophecies of an

Another change that has taken
place is the incorporation of the In-

was administered by a committee of
the trustees of Pitt. N ow the officers
are managed by its own board of
trustees, which consists of Chanctl-
lc John’ G._Bowman, president; Dr.

lined last yearvis to provide a more
desirable type of athletic competi-
tion. than is found in inter-collegiate
and inter-school competition. It is a
plan to gather contestants together
from various schools and have them
compete, in all forms of gamespyand
sports. The contestants play ‘with
each other on chance teams rather
than against each other :on‘ regular
school teams. The University. of
Pittsburgh, realizing theneed of this
type of play, and since varsity teams
were abolished, decided to enact‘ Play
Day as a culmination ‘of athletic
events for the women of the Uni-
versity. , 4

in order to attain the use of ‘ the
Stadium, Trees Gym, and the Heinz

events will take ‘place; in the Stadium
with a dip. in the pool following.
Heinz House will be the scene of
the day's climax with a formal ban.-

behind it every year. There must be a reason

ramp a load into the bowl of your pipe and

Times, a portion of the au-

as a protest against the playing of
Stravinsky's ..Le Sucre du Prin-

uninteresting. If it had been re-

DEDICATE TRACK ‘I-IOUSE
Increases 1928-29’ Schedule

--For Carlson’: Men To

Eighteen Games

 

The Pitt basketball schedule for
next season has been increased to
eighteen games, with the announce-
ment yesterday by Director of Ath-
letics W. D. Harrison that the Pan-

other courtmen will meet Butler Col-

lege at Indianapolis, Ind., the night
of December 13.

This game moves up the opening
game of the originally scheduled
Western invasion, which was to have
been with Wisconsin at Madison,
Wis., December 14. The complete
Western trip now includes: Butler
College, December 13; Wisconsin,
December 14; Northwestern, at
Evanston, December 15, and Ohio
State, at Columbus, December 17.

The Butler. contest, which is the
opener for both teams, will formal-

ly dedicate the huge new track house V
that has recently been built at In-

dianapolis and which has a seating
capacity of 16,500, the college having
an enrollment of over 5,000.

Paul D. Hinkle, Butler coach, will
send one of the most powerful teams
in the Middle West against the Pan-
thers in the ﬁrst game of the'West-
ern jaunt. Every year this non-
Conference team 1 takes a trip
through the Conference and two.
years ago they duplicated the recent
feat of Coach Carlson’s.. men ‘by
trimming ﬁve Western Conference
teams in a row, including their
champion. -

Last year Butler College was one
of the three teams that took the
number of €Notre »Dame. Besides
Pitt’s triumph over the lrishers and
the defeat Butler handed‘ them,
Michigan State was the only other
team to defeat Coach Keogan’s fa-
mous team.

Greek Cage Team Managers -Pick 
’ Delta Taus, Three Phi Kappasli or Weeklvy’s?  I

All Fraternity Combination

sentative of the best players‘ in the

the three teams stated here.

No doubt popularity. on the cam-
pus inﬂuenced the selection some-
what; ﬁve members of Sutherland’s
championship football I squad are
among those named. This can be
accounted for, since the football
players as a rule keep in condition
the year around, and therefore have
the advantage over other players.

On the ﬁrst team we have Arture,
Alpha Phi Delta, at forward; this
boy was the leading’ scorer in his
division of the league. He was es-
pecially noted for his work in the
Kappa Sigma game, when he scored
more than twice the number of
points scored by the entire Kap a
Sigma team, thereby winning t e
division championshipfor the Alpha
Phi Delta. V

At the other forward position is
P. Mcclanahan of the Delta Tau
Delta. Delta Tau Delta also won
the championship of their division,
and it was largely through the lead-
ership and aggressiveness of Mc-
Clanahan that the team did so well.

Dick Goldberg, Pi Lambda Phi,
was almost unanimous choice for
center. Even though the Pi Lambs
didn't win the championship of‘ divi-
sion three, they threatened seriously
for a time. Dick didn’t lead the
league in scoring, but he played an
unusually good game both on the
offensive and defensive. There is no
doubt that Dick still retains some
of that talent which he had when
he played freshman basketball for
Pitt several years ago.

Bill Kern, Phi Kappa, of football
fame, was the most popular selec-
tion for guard. Very few men
scored on the Phi Kappa because
Kern wasn’t able to stop them. Be-
side his good defensive game Bill
contributed many points toward the
victories which brought the cham-
pionship of division three to the Phi
Kappa.

Fenow, Alpha Phi Delta, is at the
other guard position. Unlike most
guards. Fenow plays excellently on
the oﬁensive. He has a knack of
makin ‘long shots go through the
hoop; in several games he was high
scorer.

On the second team Mulvey, Phi
Kappa. and Simon, Phi Epsilon Pi,
are at forwards. Mulvey played in
very few games, but his work was
so outstanding that he could not well
be kept off the team. Simon was
the backbone of the Phi Ep team;
it was mainly through his work that
the Phi Eps were tough for the other
teams in their section. J. McClana-
ban, Delta Tau Delta, is at center;
he led the oﬁense of the Delta Tans
and incidentally led his team in scor-
ing. Ghetto, who played center for

Phi Kappa, draws down a guard post
due to the fact tint he Played un-

PITT RUNNERS;-UP   .

 

 

Pickard, Welch, .~.,....... And
Wibecan Gain Second
Places At Meet

Annexing four second‘ places, Pitt’s
track and ﬁeld representatives won
the runner-up position ‘in the Penn
Relays at Franklin Fiyeldlast Sat-
urday. Vic Pickard, Don. Gwynn,
Gibby Welsh and Ken eWlbe‘can were
the Panthers that deﬁed the’mud and
rain to-place high in the" carnival
ﬁnals. ~  ’ ’

Vic Pickard, in defending’ his title
got second in a duel with Sabin
Carr, Yale’s Woi-ld’s Champion.
Pickard gave a very creditable exhi-
bition in vaulting 12 feet 9 inches.
Carr used what dry weather there
was in attempting to establish a new
world record but alheavy rain stop-
ped his climbing at 13 feet. Pick-
ard and the other contestants then
came out in the shower to do their
stuff and they were not expected to
go over 12 feet under such trying
conditions. - ~

Don Gwynn, Panther hammer
thrower ranking with the best of
the nation, ﬁnished close ‘second to
Wright of Cornell with a heave of
152 feet iléinches, less than 8 inches
short of Wright’: winning heave.

Captain Gibby Welsh was not up
to his best form in the discus’ throw,
his best toss measuring 139 feet 8%
inches. pliasmus of Ohio State won
the event with a toss of 144 feet 2%
inchts.

Wright Gets Taylor
Trophy Permanently

. By James Patterson

William (Bus) Wright, a senior
in the school of Business Adminis-
tration and a member of Kappa
Sigma fraternity. has been awarded
the Hat? Quig Taylor Memorial
Trophy or the third consecutive
year. This tro by is representative
of the highest honor bestowed upon
a Pitt swimmer, and upon which
each year, the eyes of every tank-
men are focused. The trophy is
awarded annually by the athletic
committee to the most valuable man
on the team, on the basis of scholar-
ship, collegiate points scored, points
scored in outside events, and at-
tendance at practice. In short; it
is an appreciation of general all-
around ability.

Wright, a product of Allegheny
High school, iloted that team
throu h an un efeated season and
the c ampionship of the Tri-State
district In 1924. As a freshman at
the university, Bus was elected cap-
tain and led the fresh through an
undefeated season. Wright was
unanimous! elected captain of the
varsity In is junior year, after his
impressive record on the varsity
durin his so homore year. Bus was
awar ed the aylor Trophy in both
these years. Wright's cohorts again
showed their appreciation of him as
a leader when he was re-elected to
captain the varsity swimming team
in his senior year.

Every individual that knows Bus,
has conﬁdence in this curly-headed
blonde, and feels assured of a last-
ing friendship b the evidence of
that pleasant smi e that is ever pre-
dominate. lie is of a quiet nature,
believing, perhaps, that actions
speak louder than words, and this
being so, he is surely shoutin to
the world. Wright holds the ni-
versity of Pittsburgh's records in
the 40-yard, 60-yard and 100-yard
free-style events, and has captured
the fancy diving contest three years
consecutivel in the annual Pitt
Championships. He holds records at
various tanks throughout the coun-
try including such outstanding ones
as: Army, Lafayette, Tech, Wooster,
Notre Dame, Navy, Syracuse, New
York U. and Erie “Y.” Besides
this remarkable list of startling rec-
ords, Wright holds the Senior Alle-
gheny Mountain Association record
for the 50-yard free-style’ event with
the fast time of 0:24 3-5.

At the close of the Pitt schedule,
Wright was conected with the Pitts-
burgh Athletic Association, repre-
senting that club at the Nationals
held in Chicago. He has been a
valuable man to Pitt in the ast
four years and we look with a t nge
of sorrow as “Bus," the greatest
acquatic luminary to ace a Pan-
ther outﬁt, graduates in June.

‘WOMEN IN BUSINESS’
WILL BE DISCUSSED

Dr. Elmer Will Speak Before
Women's Efficient Living
Council

Dr. M. C. Elmer, head of the
sociilogy de artment, will speak on
“Women in usiness” before the last
conference of the year of the
woman's council on efficient living at
Heinz House during assembly hour
Friday. The conference will be held
in conjunction with the intercol-
legiate conference of W. S. G. A.

In his discussion, Dr. Elmer will
dwell on the idea of girls entering
the business world after graduation-
from the Universit . Dr. Elmer
maintains that the usiness world
holds more interest and ex erience
than teaching, a vocation. w ch at-
tracts a superabundance of teachers.

SPRING GRID DRILLS
WILL CLOSE SOON

Sutherland About Decided
On His First Team
Combination

As the adverse weather prohibited
grid practice on last Friday and Sat-
urday, Dr. Sutherland decided to
continue workouts at leastvtill Sat-
urdaly of this week and possibly for
anot er six days. In the coming
practice, it is “Jock’s” intention to
drill the new signals and pie. s into
the heads of his linemen an back-
field. This will be a little less diffi-
cult to do than it would have been
at the beginning of spring training,
March 21.

The Panther s uad has ﬁnally
taken an almost de nite form. Park-
inson is certainly the outstanding
candidate for fullback with his
strong toe, and ability to make good
his rapier-like thrusts through cen-
ter. Jim Roonev, a Blue and Gold
star of two years ago, has returned
to the squad bringing with" him his
long punts and his short but certain
off-tackle jabs, while Tob- Uansa
may be counted upon to dup icate the
feats of “Gibby” Welch. This back-
ﬁeld, together with Charlie Edwards
at quarter, will certainly prove for-
midable against 'any squad. _

In the reserves, Baker, Frosh grid-
dist and basketball ﬂash of last sea-
son, will prove a cool quarter on ﬁle
offense, as well as an almost‘ certain
safety man. Walenchas,‘ Schultz
and Jahn, all light for college foot-
ball, but dependable performers, will
make names for themselves in the
coming schedule at half- Hood is
certainly a superb-' full to hold, until
his strong forward, or ripping
plunges are necessary.

A backﬁeld, however, is only as
strong as its line. Donchess and
Guarino certainly make excellent
terminals, and Captain Fox has
proven his ability as center. Mont-

omery and Getto, Klinger and Tul-
y make up the remainder of the
line that may sweep the Panthers to
victory next year. .

THE PIT!’ WEEKLY

 

Panther Tank Captain
Thrilled With Honor

Albert Mango, a junior in the col-
lege, was unanimously named cap-
tain of next year's swimming team
following the banquet held at the
Faculty Club last Thursday evening.
“I have looked forward to such a
thrill since my freshman year," said

appreciation to his team-mates.

“Al is one of the most conscien-
ious men that I have had the pleas-
ure of knowing. He is a real fellow
and a good sport. I am sure that we
have made no mistake in our choice,”
was the tribute paid by Bus Wright,
retiring captain. Al 18 a man that
takes his work seriously, yet when
dull moments come he has a proud
and deﬁant pose that makes one be-
lieve that he could conquer any task
within his realm.

Mango is a graduate of Erie East
High School, competing on the var-
sity tank outﬁt during his senior
year. He is a member of the Erie
Boy’s Club and the Erie Y. M. C. A.
swimming teams. He holds the City
Championship of Erie for the 100-
yard back stroke event with a mark
of 1:07. In 1925 he entered Pitt and
became a mtmber of the frosh mer-
men. He improved under the tutor-
ship. of Pat Corr, and during his
freshman debut, broke all the back
stroke records that had stood un-
touched‘ for many seasons. He holds
back stroke records at Army,
Wooster, Carnegie, Tech, Lafayette,
Erie and Pittsburgh. Al hung up
Pitt tank marks for the 100-yard
back stroke with 1:08 2-5 and the
150-yard back stroke with the time
of 1:48 2-5. In the recent Pitt
Championships, Mango won the 150-
yard back stroke, placed second in
the fancy diving and nabbed third
place in the 440-yard free style
event. In his three years of inter-
collegiate competition he has never
been defeated in any individual event
in which he was entered, which is a
mark for future tankers to shoot at
for some time to come.

The mermen all speak of Al as
one of he most likeable fellows that
they have known, his swimming
manner blazing the way for friend-
ships that are true blue. In lead-
ing the natators of 1929, he will be
the nucleus of one of the most for-
midable tank aggregations that Pit
has launched for many a season. The
prospects for a repetition of this
year’s performance are bright and
in “Al” the men have a leader,‘ a
scholar, a good sportsman and a
true friend.

Versatile Frosh Swimmer {Is
Named Honorary Head -
Of Tankers

Fred Wooldridge, versatile frosh
splasher, was elected honorary cap-
tain of this year's freshmen tankers.
‘At the close of each season the
freshmen elect a man from their
ranks, who in their estimation, has

 

to be a true representative of their
outﬁt. ' _
Wooldridﬁ received his early
‘ 'sk

training at iminetas preparatory
school, located at Saltsbu Later
he ; entered Peabody Hig School

where he established a name for
himself as well as being the out-
standing splasher of the East. End”-
ers for several seasons. -In,-192'], at
the Thirteenth Annual Pitt Inter-
Scholastics, Wooldridge smashed the
record for the 100-yard back stroke
event and hung up in its place the
fast time of 1:08. He entered Pitt
in the fall and became Pat Carr's
mainstay of the Panther yearlin

mermen, competing in the 60-ya '
relay as anchor man, 40-yard free
style, 100-yard free st le,_ 220-yard
free style and 100-ya back stroke
events. 5 He placed high in the Pitt
Championships this year, ‘pgacin

second to Wright in the 1 -y ,

free style event, and trailing Al
Mango in the 150-yard back stroke
race. At the close of the season,
during the progress of an open meet
held at the Downtown Y. M. E-C. A.,
Wooldridge succeeded in establish-
ing a new record for the Junior A.
M. A. free style classic with the re-
