UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Bicentennial serves as platform for donations

By Dirk Kaufman
Managing Editor

There have been fireworks, fa-
mous cowboys and fun galore to
amuse Pitt students, faculty and
staff this year. But above all these,
there may be a more dominant
theme to the bicentennial:

Philanthropy.

“The real point is that the
bicentennial serves as the
launching platform for huge
contributions being solicited from
all over the country,” Robert
Hickey, director of the Bicenten-
nial Commission said yesterday.

”This is the year in which, if
you do [contribute], lots of
people will notice it.”

Hickey, 50, has been head of
the commission since its incep-
tion in Sept. 1985 and a part of

the university community for 19
years. His former position was as-
sistant vice chancellor for the
Health Sciences.

” ’1987 —— The year it all hap-
pens’ is our catch—al| phrase to
keep us reaching for [the],goals

we have set for this year's Greek
Week,” said Ken Kumer, Overall

' Greek Week Chairman and Phi

Gamma Delta brother.

Greek Week is an annual Pitt
event in which thetfraternities
and sororities raise money for a
community charity.

’’It is a time when the Greeks
compete against each other, but
also, it is time for the Greeks to
drop their letters and pull
together,” said Kumer.

In the past, beneficiaries of
Greek Week earnings have in-
cluded such charities as Family
House, Eye and Ear Hospital and
Helping Hand. Average dona-
tions for each charity are around
$55,000.

Each year the Greeks contrib—.
ute hundreds of pints of blood to
the Central Blood Bank of Pitts-
burgh. Last year's drive helped to
end a Pittsburgh ‘area blood
shortage.

Although the actual Greek
Week events will not occur until
early March, planning has been
underway since lastsummer.

Kumer, his co-chairman, Linda

Wolf, an alumna of Delta Delta ‘

Delta, and Jeff Martchek, busi-
ness manager and Phi Gamma
Delta brother, began preparations
last May. '
The charity selected this year is
the Harmarville Rehabilitation In-

-stitute. Harmarville isa non-profi_t_.

”The Joseph Katz contribution

who are talking about making

_WASHINGTON — President

Reagan has discussed his

, recollections of the Iran-Contra

affair with Chief of Staff Donald
T. Regan and White House coun-

sel Peter Wallison to help con-

struct an official chronology of _

related events, a White House
spokesman said today.

Deputy Press Secretary Albert
R. Brashear, amending his state-
ment of last week indicating that
Reagan had not held-such meet-
ings, said today he did not know
the exact dates of the sessions or
the specific questions discussed.
He said Regan had spoken with
the president ”at_ some length

_ toward the end of November.”

Reagan, who returned Monday ,

from a three-day’ holiday

weekend at Camp David, Md,.,.,
,_ has‘ not answered questionsfrom ~,

.-.,‘

 

;diversions

a presidential news conference
last Nov. 19. ’

Brashear said the president had
discussed issues that were expect-
ed to be brought up during an an-
ticipated interview with the
members of the Tower Commis-
sion, which is looking into the
role of the National Security
Council. —

‘The spokesman ‘said the inter-
view with the panel, headed by
former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas,
was expected to take place ”in
the next couple of weeks.”-

Brashear said the chronology,
which Wallison has been compil-
ing since the revelations of clan-
destine arms sales and alleged
of profits to
Nicaraguan rebels, was ”not
quite complete.” But he said the

president, before meeting with
the Tower panel," ”will, have a '

chance to go over what we hope

by that time" will be to, thebest of.

Last week, Brashear said no
high-level interviews with the

president about his recollections’

of the _affair hadtakenplace.
Brashear had said: ”At this time
we do not think it's appropriate
to ask him to try and remember
a ‘series of rather complicated
events that unfolded over a long
period of time,"’
~' in the past several weeks, the
White House has contended that
Reagan should not be asked to
recall the events until he has a full
chronology drawn up by his staff.
White House officials also have
said Reagan's recuperation from
his Jan. 5 prostate surgery has
complicated setting up his inter-
view with the_ Tower com-
mission. "
Although sources on the com-
mission have said they were seek-
ing an appointment with Reagan,

degree was left open and was
later used forthis purpose.

”There are persons in the
university community who wait
until you begin to perform act I
ofa three-act play, and they sug-
gest perhaps a change in script,"

he said. ”We'tried to write the. V
script in such a way that, lacking ‘

omnipotence, when someone
drew something to our attention,

we could address it — and we_ .

Hickey said he is happy with
his decision to take the job.

”The change of pace and tak-
ing the off-beat assignment for me
has been very renewing,” he
said. ”You have the advantage of,
in your lifetime, being ableto

watch the start and the finish of —

HARRISBURG — Robert
Patrick Casey was sworn in as
Pennsylvania's 42nd governor
Tuesday afternoon, and immedi-
ately called for the creation of a
”Pennsylvania partnership to
lead the state into the future.”

Also Tuesday, Mark Singel was

As part of his inauguration
speech, Casey said the partner-

stunning as were taken 200 years
ago by a coalition that fashioned
the U.S. constitution.”

Son surrenders father
after police standoff

SPRINGDALE, Pa. —— An
18-year-old man held his father at
gunpoint for nearly two hours be-
fore dawn Monday, but he sur-
rendered without further
incident, police said.

Police said Michael Cichoski
pointed a rifle at his father, John,
in their Center Street apartment at
about 3:15 a.m. Monday and
called authorities.

Both Springdale and Pa. State
Police supported by police from

surrounding Allegheny County
communities, surrounded the fa-
miIy’s garage apartment as
Springdale patrolman Victor DiS-
anti talked to Cichoski into sur-
rendering at about 5:20 a.m.,
according to state police in
Pittsburgh.

Police said the incident began
when they were called to the area
to investigate a hit—and—run acci-
dent. Cichoski called police from
the apartment and said he had a
rifle and would shoot his father
and himself, DiSanti said.

Cichoski was taken to Alleghe-
ny Valley Hospital where he un-
derwent psychiatric evaluation
Monday. Police said no charges
were filed as of yet.

Young cancer victim
dies in car accident

GREENVILLE, Pa. —— A 2-year-
old girl whose illness bolstered
the fight against cancer has died
in a car accident on an icy Merc-
er County road, authorities said.

Megan Andrusky of Creenville,
the 1986 poster child for the Phi
Theta Phi fraternity at Thiel Col-
lege, was declared dead on ar-
rival at Greenville Regional
Hospital on Sunday morning,
authorities said. ’

The girl was part of the frater-
nity’s annual walk—a-thon from
Greenville to Children's Hospital

of Pittsburgh on Dec. 5 and 6.
The effort raised $30,400.

Hempfield Township police
said a car driven by her mother,
Linda Andrusky, slid out of con-
trol on Leech Road and struck a
tree. They said Mrs. Andrusky
was not injured in the one—car ac-
cident.

”She didn't have a whole lot of
a chance to live. This was God's
choice so she didn't have to
suffer,” Andrusky said. ”She lived
a short life, but she brought a lot
of people together.”

The girl was undergoing treat-
ment at Children's Hospital for
neuroblastoma, a cancer of the
nervous system and bone
marrow.

Liberty Belltapped

By Lee Linder l

Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA — The Liberty
Bell, its voice silenced more than
a century ago by a crack, was
tapped Monday, setting off bell-
ringing across the country and the
ocean in celebration of Martin
Luther King Jr.’s national holiday.

”Let us reaffirm the wisdom of
his vision, the righteousness of
his message, the glory of his
cause,” said Samuel ‘Pierce Jr.,
secretary of the US. Department
of Housing and Urban De-

as a personal friend of King's to
participate in the ceremony, pat-

A new Oakland housing
project has been approved by
the city zoning board of ad-
justment.

The townhouse and con-
dominium development will
occupy 2.4 acres of land
where the old Holmes Ele-
mentary School is now. The
school was shut down last
June by order of the city
school board.

The $3.2 million project is

the effort of the Oakland Plan-

Housing plan approved

in Rev. King's honor

of the Reagan administration to
the festivities here.

”Let the spirit of our age merge
the legacy of our founding fathers
with the dream of Martin Luther
King,” Pierce said. ”Let us spread
his message of freedom, justice,
equality through all the land.”

As Pierce hit the bell, located
in a special pavillion across the
street from Independence Hall,
the Centennial Bell in the hall's
tower rang seven times, once for
each letter in the word ”liberty.”

Then the signal was carried
across the country by radio to ev-
ery state capital, where replicas
of the Liberty Bell also tolled. It

Talking over cold coffee I

I almost didn't recognize him.

He was standing in front'of
Primanti Brothers the other night,
his right hand holding a wooden‘
crutch and his left hand support-
ing two Styrofoam cups, one con-
taining cold coffee and another
containing nothing. It was not un-
til he mumbled his message that
I placed his face.

' r'_”Spa_re any change?" V
" ‘ He had been featured in a
‘column’ in this newspaper earli-

er that day, and his reaction in-
cluded leaving his filthy jacket in
the closet and wearing a tan
leather coat. Poor man. He was
already believing his press clip-
pings. Although his sweater had
been attacked by moths, his blue
jeans and sneakers were in
remarkably good shape. But the

V crutch bothered me.

Two students walked by
Primanti’s. '

”Hey, Larry," they called.

I stuffed a dollar into his cup

I and asked Larry about his leg.

"Always been bad,” Larry said.
He said he injured it almost

seven years ago, three years be-

fore he lost his job as an assistant
manager at an Oakland restaur-

I ant when the owner sold out to

Sheetz. His troubles began in‘
1980, though, after his father
passed away. Larry's mother
received a handsome check from
an insurance company, he said,
and Larry sought out Lenny Levy,
the former Pirate and used car

 

JOE ZEI-'-F

dealer.

Larry drove away in a 1967
Plymouth.

’’Good condition,’’ Larry said
as three passers-by passed by. My
friend stuffed another dollar into
hiscup. Larry was on aroll. ”That
car had everything in it, 317 en-
gine, nice body. Oh, yeah.”

A Oh, yeah. Larry wrecked it the

' following-day, before he could

make his first payment. He said
he crashed head-on into another
car.

”| smashed the steering wheel
with my stomach. My nose hit
the dashboard,” Larry said.

”I was legal, and all his stuff
wasexpired. His registration, his
driver's license, all that stuff. And
he wanted to sue me."

Larry borrowed $3,750 from
his mother to pay back" Lenny
Levy and to pay other expenses
— including alcoholic expenses.

”Drank her,dry,” Larry con-
fessed. ' . V

He said he has taken to the
streets to settle his debt with his
mother. He's already paid her
back $950. Just $2,800 to go. He
buses from Squirrel Hill, where
helives with his mother, to Oak-
land every night and solicits stu-
dents until 2 or 3 am. If he
cannot secure a ride, he

meanders to Frankstown
Boulevard in" Homewood to
"make some more money."

Can someone make a living
with three magic words and a
Styrofoam cup?

”I do pretty good,” Larry said.
”Sometimes it's better, some-
times it's worse than a minimum-
wage job. Good nights and bad
nights, here and there.”

But Larry is not satisfied.

- ’’I might be working at a

restaurant, you know, down [at]'

Station Square. Someone might
be leaving. I know someone, and
they said someone might be leav-
ing and lcould work,” Larry said.

He said businessis up, even
though my friend and I found his
cup to be vacant. He said he
hadn't read the story about him-
self, but many students had
brought it to his attention. Little
did he know its author stood be-
fore him. Better not to say any-
thing. He was too busy talking
about becoming "the next sym-
bol of Oakland, likessome guy in
I62.II

Midnight passed, students were
filing into the bars and Larry
wasn't paying attention. He was
too‘ busy talking. Steve and I
thought it best to walk to the car.
He followed us around the corn-

. er, as fast as he could hobble. Fi-
nally, at Rax, he stopped and

surrendered with a smile.

”Yeah,” Larry said, shaking his ;

head. "I’ve got all the luck.'’

It's a Zippyesque defense

”I pray for my little girls every
day," said Patricia Roush-Samuta.
”I’ll talk to God about the girls.
I tell Him that they love me, and
I love them. We are so close.
How can this be happening?”

I first spoke with Roush—Samuta

- almost a year ago. The story she

told me then was almost unbeara-
ble in its cruelty. And now, as the
new year begins, things don't
seem any better.
Roush—Samuta, who lives in
Cicero, III., is divorced from a
Saudi-Arabian named Khalid Al-
Gheshayan. They married in
1978, when AI-Gheshayan was
in the United States as a student.
They had two daughters, Alia and
Aisha. _ '
According to Roush—Samuta,
the marriage was a bad one, and
Al-Gheshayan moved back to

_ Saudi Arabia. She attended nurs-

ing school in the United States
while caring for the girls. Eventu-
ally she divorced Al-Gheshayan
and was granted sole custody of
the two girls. _

In December of 1985 Al-
Gheshayan came back ‘to the
United States. ”He began an in-
credible campaign of harassment
against me and the girls,” Roush-
Samuta said. ”This included tel-

_ ephone calls through the day and

‘THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 21, I987

night, coming to my home and
ringing the doorbell and knock-
ing on windows, following me in
a rented car and circling the
school where my older child at-
tended. He got a lawyer in Chica-
go, and they filed papers for
visitation rights. All I wanted was

'a peaceful solution to this

problem.”

On Jan. 25, I986, Roush-
Samuta allowed her ex-husband
to visit with the two girls. Appar-
ently he took them to the airport
and flew with them to Saudi Ara-
bia — where they remain to this
day. Alia is 7; Aisha is 4.

”I reached my ex-husband at
his father's house in Riyadh, Sau-
di Arabia, four days after the girls
were kidnapped,” Roush—Samuta
said. ”He wouldn't let me speak
to the girls. He said, ‘All Alia does
is cry for you.’ ”

When I first spoke with Roush-
Samuta about this, she asked me
not to write about it. She was
working through U.S. govern-
ment channels, and had been ad-
vised that publicity might hinder

the case.

So, for almost a year, she has
kept a public silence and has
hoped that the U.S. and Saudi
Arabian governments would ar-
range" to bring her daughters

home. Every day she has lived
with the thought of the two little
girls, in a strange land, separated
from their mother and the way of
life they had grown up with in-
America.
" Finally, last month, she could
take no more. She asked me if I
could help her get the word out
about what had happened. Chi-
cago Tribune reporter Joel Kaplan
investigated the story and wrote
about it on the front page of that
newspaper. ' Among the docu-
ments Kaplan saw were lengthy
arrest records of AI-Gheshayan
and medical records which diag-
nose him as an alcoholic suffer-
ing from schizophrenia.

So now the story is out —- but_
the girls are stillin Saudi Arabia,

and no one seems to know how
to get them back. V

U.S. Senator Alan Dixon (D-Ill.)
has been taking an interest in the
case ever since Roush-Sumata
contacted his office following the
kidnapping. His executive assis-

tant, Sarah Pang, said, ”I don't -

see how anyone, when they
listen to this story, can ignore it.
One woman alone cannot rescue
two little girls who have been kid-
napped to Saudi Arabia. A 7-year-
old girl and a 4-year-old girl have
been taken away from their
mother, their school, their
church, their friends. And still
they remain in Saudi Arabia.
”The little girls must be so con-

fused and so hurt and so scared.
They're living in a world they
can't understand. they must have

been told that they will never see _

their mother again.
”Our office has been trying for

a year now to make something .

happen. It's so heartbreaking.”
As for Roush-Sumata, she has

not allowed herself to give up

hope. d

”I call my ex-husband's house

in Saudi Arabia all the time,” she
said. ”No one there will let me‘
speak to my little girls. I haven't
spoken a word to them since the
day they were kidnapped.

 

She'd like to reachout and touch them

”As soon as the people there‘

hear my voice, they click off the
phone. My ex-husband says, ‘You
don't need your daughters."
”There have been times when
I have heard my girls’ voices in
the background. I can hear their
little voices talking in English. For
a moment I'm glad to hear them.

I But then when the people at my
ex-husband's house hang up, I

get so depressed thinking about
it."

She is afraid that the girls have
been persuaded to forget about
her and give up on her. "Maybe
they have written me off,” she
said. ”A year is a long time when
you're that young. I think about
it, and I imagine: them saying to
each other, ‘Do you remember
Mommy?’ ” ‘

Both Roush—Samuta and Sarah .

Pang in Sen. Dixon's office can-
not believe that nothing can be
done about this case. But it is
nearing a year since the girls were
taken. And ‘no one has come up
with a solution yet. . . 
- »”There is one thing I refuse to

 let:-myself think‘ about,” Roush-
Samuta said. '”I refuse’ to let”rny- g

self think about the idea that I will
never see my daughters again.”

Legislation ineffective in curbing druguse.

The only reason we, as Ameri-

cans, have never fulfilled the

ideals of our system and ‘our
sense of justice is our preoccupa-
tion with the fact that the Russi-
ans ——_ our mortal adversaries —-
seem determined to keep the
world an arena for Superpower
competition, something very like
a Superbowl. The sportsman

_ mentalityis little trusted by many‘

philosophers, and justice is, in es-
sense a philosophical experience.
The root of all justice is con-

- science, the root of all politics is

competition. » _

We seek invulnerability. What
does this invulnerability offer us?
It offers us the safety of a nuclear
arsenal, while strained finances
allow our cities to crumble into
anarchy. Of what use is a concept
like justice when dealingwith a
crazed environment?

Take Detroit, for example.
Most of the murders there are
drug-related.. Kids killing each
otherover, and about drugs many

" of them walk the streets with

guns. V
What happens when people
like that, growing up in the cities,

Dr. Ruth

Q: I am a 32-year-old woman
with a 3-year-old daughter, and
I have been married nine years.

- My husband, 31, now claims that

he wasn't ready for marriage, and
that while I have grown old, he
has stayed young. (What he calls
old, I call mature.) We are getting
a divorce. Could this have been
prevented?

A: I would like to spend a lot of
time asking questions of you and
your husband about what might
be the real issues _between you
two. Not because I have a wand
‘and can put broken marriages
together, but you both_ might

learn something abouthow cou-l ,

  

take acid, take other, harder
drugs? Maybe they stay pretty
much the same; maybe they get
crazier; maybe they improve
themselves when faced with such

extreme unknowns. We really‘

should try to find out, but our sys-
tem, maintaining its sad and bru-
tal posture against the Russians,
has become a competitor against
the American situationas well.
Detroit, for example, has become
far too difficult to deal with in
order for law enforcement to
work. Just-as we ignore our obli-
gation to suffering elsewhere on

the globe, choosing instead to .
Xposture militantly against the

Soviets, so do we ignore our ob-
ligation to the cities and the pos-

sibility for real change. We forfeit

our cities, simply because our
system is preoccupied with pow-
er and unconcerned with justice.

Our system inspires the fear of
law and makes silent victims of
those in the cities who have

-doubts about the character of

American justice. The Establish-
ment and the System not only
make people lose confidence in
the prospect of hope for Ameri-

ples fall out, how you fell out and
how you can steer clear of known
dangers the next time around.

Just because he gives the ex-

cuse that he has stayed young
and you have matured, which

does makehim sound like a nit-
wit, does not mean that is the real
reason.

I am not saying that it was sex,
or that a sex therapist could‘ cure
your marriage with a few thera-
py sessions. It might have been
any one of a dozen common
causes of estrangement —— resent-
ments that have nothing to do

with sex — money, unfair or un-

JAMES cnnnv

can involvement in foreign affairs
but also very cynical about drugs,
so they are alienated by the sys-
tem of justice. Neither situation
should be the case. It is negli-
gence on the part of our legal and

' educational system, which sim-

ply cannot face up to the suffer-
ing in the world, nor the suffering
in the cities which transcends in-
ternational competition with the
Soviets and which indeed are our
highest and most important
callings.

Drug use is a profound and un-
varying issue in the cities. People
get killed all the time for them,
over them andabout them. The
fact that city, state and federal
government cannot seem to ad-
dress the problem simply sug-
gests that they want people to be
killed over drugs. The law en-
forcement agencies, which keep
incredibly strict laws on the
books but virtually never enforce
those laws, are responding with
brutality, fear and inconsistency

to the problem. It almost seems
-as if they like the fact that people
are killing each other.

The idea.that federal, state and
city governments like the killing

which is going on is far-fetched.

only ifyou know nothing about
Freudian psychology. They like
the killing in a very similar way
to the manner which viewers of
Rambo like the killing. If the po-
litical spectrum isn't like the sil-
ver.screen, then how come an
actor gets picked for the Oval
Office? Basically, the bloodthirst
is subconscious. Either ‘that, or
they are stupid. Can’t'be both,
unless they're insane, which I
suppose is also possible.

Many, many more people are
killed in cities than Americans
killed by Russians, Nicaraguans
and Iranians combined. 50 what
is going on with our rhetoric? In
the pathological fear of disloyalty
andcommunism we are ‘aban-
doning our closest brothers, our
peers, our neighbors. It is almost
as if Americans relate to each
other as enemies, as adversaries.

drug users often find the weirdest

She came. to her position not

no one else can — or has at-

done so almost by default for
the past 7, years.

Today is her birthday — she
is 77 years old.

thing they have to learn,” she
said. ”Nobody should look

I was wrong. She proved it

There are three. It was a little

United Way
fails to meet
campaign

goals for '86

Sixty-eight health and human
service agencies will be the
recipients of over $20 million
from the United Way of Alleghe-
ny County, a decrease of 4.1 per-
cent compared to last year's
allocations. _

Though the United Way failed
to meet its 1986 campaign goal,
funds collected will benefit such
agencies as the Western Pennsyl-
vania Chapter of the Arthritis
Foundation, Family and Chil-
dren’s Service and the Salvation
Army, by over $1 million each.

These and other allocations

amount to the United Way of Al-.

legheny County's share of the
1986 United Way of. South-
western Pennsylvania's fund rais-
ing campaign.
Recommendations of more
then 180 community volunteers
who served on eight citizen
review committees were ‘taken
into account by United Way's
board of directors when deciding
which agencies would receive al-
locations. 
Each volunteer spent approxi-

mately 40 hours visiting agencies, -
interviewing board members and

staff, and reviewing budgets and
extensive information about each
agency before arriving at their
recommendations. V

”The United Way of Alleghe-
ny County is very proud that it is
able to continue providing sub-
stantial resources to so many im-

'portant health and human service
agencies in our area,” said Justin I

M. Johnson, chairman of the
United Way's Resource Manage-
ment Committee.

Artificial intelligence
conferenceplanned    

By Jonathan Berr
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
will host the Third international
Conference on Artificial Intelli-
gence from May 10-18. The con-
ference will focus on how
artificial intelligence can be uti-
lized for educational purposes.

The conference is being or-
ganized by Drs. Jefferey Bonnar,
Stellhan Ohlsson and Robert
Glaser of Pitt's Learning and
Resource Development Center.

”We are bringing together Al
and educational researchers,”
Ohlsson said. The organizers of
the conference expect par-
ticipants from all over the world.

According to Bonnar, Al won't
make human beings obsolete. It
is not an artificial brain. What Al
attempts to do is to make pro-
grams that will allow computers
to complete tasks that require
judgment and the organization of
expertise.‘ V
' Bonnar said one of the main
breakthroughs in Al research is in
education. Computers have been
developed in the research lab that
can help students with their
homework.

”Al is a hot, new frontier of
scientific research,” said ‘Ohls-
‘ son. in order for computers to
make decisions, he said, ”all the
knowledge must be explicit.”

lran-Contra affair mismanaged

As the public furor over the
lran-Contra affair fades, the de-
tails speaking of mismanagement
and unwarranted initiative, begin
to surface.

Robert McFarlane, former Na- I

tional Security Adviser, outlined
Israel's involvment in the affair
during recent testimony, showing

Israel to be more than an arm of

American foreign policy.

According to McFarlane, the Is-
raelis convinced Reagan‘ that the
sale of arms to Iran was a strate-
gically sound move, given Iran's
geographical location and current
political situation.

Iran is located at the head of the

oil-rich Persian gulf and has con-

siderable oil resources of its own.

It is obvious that Reagan knew
of the arms sale and supported it.
It is not clear, though, if he con-
sidered the possible implications
of his decision.

By backing the Iranians, the
Reagan administration is effec-
tively voting for the loss of Iraq
in the 6-year-old Iran-Iraq conflict

— a loss which would undoubt— ,

edly change the structure of our
other Middle East relations.

Saudi Arabia and Egypt both
support Iraq_in the conflict and
have indicated that they would
alter their relations with the West,
especially the United States, in
the event of an Iranian victory.

Reagan, though, appears to be
taking no chances. There is evi-

MATTHEW
monmou

dence that the United States has.

given information to both sides,
some of it deliberately distorted,
with the apparent aim of perpetu-
ating the conflict.

While some experts say that
the American arms shipped to
Iran have not yet played a signifi-
cant role in the war, others claim
that Iran's anti-aircraft capabilities
have improved considerably in
recent months, possibly due to
American arms. .

Both charges have been denied
by the State Department, the
same body that denied so many
other foreign policy decisions.

The problem is a complex one,

with the future of U.S. relations_

with virtuallyall the Middle East
at stake. Each day the message
from Washington, echoed by our
allies in the Middle East, is that
America is sorely in need of a co-
hesive foreign policy.

If Iran were to win the war, the
ensuing scramble among the
United States,. the Soviet Union
and the Iranians themselves to
pick up the pieces might be more
than the tenuous relations we are
supposedly establishing with
”moderates” in Tehran can han-
dle. Certainly, our ties with these
members of the Iranian govern-

ment are not valuable enough to
forfeit our other alliances.

Should Iraq win, there could be
a split in the Moslem world, shift-
ing already strained alliances.

By keeping the conflict fueled
on both sides, the United States
may be taking what Reagan con-
siders the best possible action in
a bad situation. Promotion of a
war.is certainly a new twist in a
twisted foreign policy.

It has been asserted that the in-
telligence given to Iraq might
have been to offset the-effect of
the shipment of arms to Iran. The
Iraqis claim that they lost the port
city of Fao due to incorrect infor-
mation from the United States
and Iraqi officials refuse to be-
lieve that the Americans were not

withholding information that_ri'

could have helped them.
There is speculation that the
United States was keeping the
Iran-Iraq conflict going to im-
prove our standing in the Arab
world. With a continuing war, it
would be easier for the United
States to convince other Arab
leaders to allow more American
military bases in the Persian Gulf.
Reagan has refused to use his
State of the Union speech to
apologize for his foreign policy
decisions. He feels he has noth-

ing to apologize for. Maybe he -

doesn't know what the foreign

policy decisions were, and of .

‘course feels. he has nothing for
. which to apologize.

dent, said she transferred from the
computer science program to the
business college after two years
because computer science was
not what she expected, not be-
cause she couldn't do well.

,"I had taken a BASIC [com-
puter |anguage] course in high
school, and I liked that,” said
Niedzielski.

A survey of 552 colleges by the
University of California at Los An-
geles found that about 1.6 per-
cent of students who started
college last fall wanted to major
in computer science. That com-
pares with 2.1 percent in 1985
and 4 percent in 1982.

jay Nievergelt, chairman of the
department of computer science
at the University of North Caroli-
na at Chapel Hill, said computer
science for a long time was a
"fairly specialized, technical
field. Then five years ago, per-
sonal computers hit the home,
and everybody thought you had
to be a student in computer
science. It was a fad."

Enrollment in UNC's computer
science program has dropped by
half in the past few years from a
high of about 100 students a year,
Nievergelt said.

Kalaghan said some students
apparently confused computer
science with computer_program-
ming, a_ less scientific endeavor
by which people translate the
work of the computer scientist
into instructions for the
computer.

Some computer science profes- _
sors said a decline in enrollment
is healthy.

''I think it's an excellent de-
velopment,” said UNC's Niever-
gelt, "There was an unreasonably
high flooding of computer
science curriculums, and for-
tunately that is evening out now.”

Associated Press Writer

GARY, Ind. —— At an age when
most girls are busy with school,
homework and dates, Paula
Cooper has her own routine. She
sits locked in her prison cell 23
hours a day, waiting to die.

Cooper is a teen-ager and a
murderer. In May 1985, when
she was just 15, she stabbed an
elderly Bible teacher 33 times
with a 12-inch butcher knife. Her
victim, according to testimony,
recited the Lord's Prayer as she
lay dying.

Last summer, Cooper became
the youngest female since 1892
sentenced to death in the United
States. Now 17, she is among 35
inmates, only two of them fe-
male, facing execution for.murd-
ers and other crimes committed
at age 17 or younger.

Cooper was among four teen-
age girls charged in the slaying of
Ruth Pelke, 78. They fled with
$10 and the victim's 1976
Plymouth. Cooper, portrayed as
the ringleader, received the only
death sentence; the others got pri-
son terms.

Ironically, Cooper, who plead-
ed guilty, was sentenced by a
judge who opposes the death
penalty but said the law was the
law.

"There was a tremendous per-

sonal conflict,” said Lake County.

Judgejames Kimbrough. "[But] I
felt I really had no alternative. 
I do not believe any individual
judge can pick an age and say,
'This is too young.’ "

Her attorney, Kevin Relphorde,
sees it differently. "We can't con-
done what Paula did,” he said,
"[but] I don't think we're God."

Cooper, a chronic runaway O

with a troubled childhood, was
among nine juveniles sentenced

to die in 1985 and the first nine
months of 1986. But because she
is so young and the only girl, her
case has sparked more emotion,
more debate and more publicity
than others.

"She has become a cause
Ce/ebre," said Lake County
deputy prosecutor James
McNew. "People forget about
the reason she's in prison  what
she did, the victim, the victim's
family, friends and the suffering
this has caused."

Much of the attention has come
from western Europe, where me-
dia coverage, including Cooper's
appearance on West German tel-
evision, prompted hundreds of
Germans, French and Italians to
write the judge and attorneys,
protesting her sentence.

In Gary, the No. 1 murder city

' in 1984, according to FBI statis-

tics, the response was different.
"Everybody I talked to" in the

community is in favor of her [get— .

ting] the death penalty,” Relphor-
de conceded. '

Elsewhere, Cooper's case is a
rallying point for death penalty
opponents.

"If the Ayatollah hanged a
15-year-old child, we'd say,
’good God, they're barbarous,’ "

said Henry Schwarzschild, direc- _

tor of the American Civil Liberties
Union's Capital Punishment
Project. "That's precisely what In-
diana proposes to do.”
But Ernest van den Haag,
professor of jurisprudence and
public policy at Fordham Univer-
sity, said people commit most of
their crimes from age 13 to age
20, and if they.aren’t punished,
that "in effect gives immunity to
those who commit crimes most
frequently."
Only 281 people, including
nine women, have been execut-
ed in U.S. history for crimes com-

mitted at 17 or younger. The first
was in 1642 for bestiality. The
most recent was last May for
murder. The last female execu-
tion of this kind was in 1912.
Twenty-seven states with death
penalty statutes establish mini-
mum ages at which a crime
punishable by execution can be
committed. They range from age
18 in 10 states to 10 in Indiana.
Legislation has been filed in Indi-
ana, however, to prohibit the ex-
ecution of minors. Other states are
considering similar steps. -
Victor Streib, a Cleveland State
University law professor, predicts

‘ "in the next few years the juvenile

death penalty will be history,”
noting there were 11 such sen-
tences in 1982, only six in the first
nine months of 1986.

Amnesty International says that
beyond the United States, it
knows of only 10 countries where
people younger than 18 may be
executed and have been, in some
cases, in recent years: Bangladesh,
Barbados, China, Cyprus,‘ Iran,
Ireland, Pakistan, Rwanda, South
Korea and Tonga. '

tions cite the arguments used for

adults, that the punishment is too
cruel and doesn't deter crime, but
they add that execution is even
more absurd for minors, who are
too immature to understand the fi-
nality of death.

"They seem to be diabolical at
the time, but in some sense it's the
playful behavior of adolescents,”
Streib said. "Imposing death on
people is part of child's play. They
don't understand the senseless-
ness of what they're doing."

Streib, author of an upcoming
book, Death Penalty for juveniles,
also said capital punishment fore-
closed the option of rehabilitation.

But van den _Haag argues that
no evidence shows juveniles are
more easily rehabilitated. "It's true
they have a longer life‘ before

them, but it may be a longer life-

of crime," he said. . »
McNew said prosecutors origi-
nally sought the deathpenalty for
all four girls in the Pelke 'case..But
after details of the crime became
clear, it was dropped for two of
them and pursued against Coop-
er and Karen Corder, who twist-
ed the knife in Mrs. Pelke's ribs,

Hand-in-Hand
A special day for special kids

By Marc Duchin
For The Pitt News

”l was more or less walking
around when this child, sitting up
eating, grabbed out when I was
walking by and kissed me on the
cheek,” Daniel Wright, co-
coordinator of Pitt's 1987 Hand-
in—Hand Festival, said of his first
experience as a facilitator with
the festival. ”Her face was lit
from side to side with the biggest
smile you could ever have. She
was having such a good day, and
I'm sure they don't get to do that
all thetime.”

‘ 

Her face was lit from
side to side with the

biggest smile you could %

ever have -
‘— Daniel‘ Wright

The festival, a non—profit com-
munity service organized by the
undergraduates of Pitt, has
provided for the past eight years
a full day of carnival fun for 400

mentally and physically han-

dicapped children.

Wright and Deborah Bowman,
co-coordinator of the festival,
stressed the need for volunteers
and university support as the
March 28 date for the 1987 fes-
tival approaches.

Game booths -stocked with
prizes donated by local business-
es, a full schedule of main stage
acts, clowns and special guests
entertain each handicapped guest
and his student escort."

According to Wright and Bow-
man, the games and stage shows
are designed to allow the chil-
dren as much self—expression as
possible. For "some, this-may be '
the only extracurricular recrea-
tional activity in which they can
participate during the year.

Wright and Bowman said their
primary goal has been to con-
tinue to educate the public'con-
cerning the needs of handicapped
people.

Casey calls for Pennsylvania Partnership at inaguration

HARRISBURG (AP) -— Here is
the text of Gov. Robert P. Casey's
inaugural address, delivered

' Tuesday on the steps of the
Capitol.

Mr. Chief Justice, Judge Nea-
lon, Gov. Thornburgh, Gov.
Shapp, Gov. Leader, reverend
clergy;

Ellen, my wife and partner for
33 years, you have believed in
me and sustained me;

Our children, Margi, Mary
Ellen, Kate, Bobby, Chris, Erin,
Patrick and Matt, each of you in
a special way made this day
possible;

My brother, John, you have
helped me and stood by me, and
you remember with me our par-
ents, Alphonsus and Marie, who
gave us life and love, and whose
memory and example continue
to be a source of inspiration and
strength;

My fellow Pennsylvanians:

Two centuries ago, in 1787, a
troubled people who were chil-

dren of destiny gathered in Penn-
sylvania. In the turbulent wake of
a revolution only just ended, their

- infant nation would surely perish

unless they could form a new po-
litical and social partnership un-
like anything the world had ever
seen. -

Torn by faction, paralyzed by
petty partisanship, unsure of their

Whatever the assignment, Pilot has the formula P
for writing comfort and precision.

_ Pilot's Better Ball Point Pen, in medium and ﬁne points,

we've made writer's fatigue a thing of the past.’ This crystal barreled

veteran of the campus has a ribbed ﬁnger grip for continuous comfort

and is perfectly balanced for effortless writing. Best of all, you'll never

course, and uncertain of the pos-
sibilities, they convened in Penn-
sylvania to invent the future.

Through the months of summer
and into the fall, they struggled to
write a constitution unlike any
before in the history of hu-
mankind.

And during the long and some-
times bitter debate, a former
governor of Pennsylvania, Dr.
Benjamin Franklin, took to mus-

ing about a wooden carving on _

the back of the chair of the con-
vention’s presiding officer.

The carving was a representa-
tion of the sun, and in it Franklin
saw a metaphor for the infant na-
tion; but, he wondered, had the
artist meant to carve it as a sun
that was rising or setting?

Finally, on Sept. 17, 1787, the
Constitution_was born, and Dr.
Franklin told his fellow delegates:

“Now at length I have the happi-
ness to know that it is a rising and
not a setting sun.”

What that sun was rising on, of
course, was a future made possi-
ble by a great constitutional part-
nership. The genius of that
partnership is that it has room for
all of us and a place for each of
us. .

Now again we gather in Penn-
sylvania and once more the times
are perilous.

The new revolutions which

rage within our borders are no
less threatening because they are
economic and social rather than
military.

The human suffering which en-
gulfs entire Pennsylvania com-
munities is no less painful
because it is rooted in industrial
decline rather than’ armed insur-
rection.

The future of harsh limits and

forecast for our children is not
made less painful by the weak as-
sertion that this is the best we can
do against forces we cannot
control.

I believe that once gain, it is
within our power to determine
whether Pennsylvania's sun is to
set or to rise. I believe that the
choice is ours; all we have_to do
is make it. I believe the future is
ours; all we have to do is seize it.

That is why I have come here
today: to take command, notof
the status quo, which is
shadowed by the dusk, but of our
future, illuminated in the brilli-
ance of the dawn.

That is why I call for a new

Pennsylvania partnership: A
Pennsylvania Partnership which
must be as bold and stunning as
that which two centuries ago
fashioned in Philadelphia the
Constitution which I have just
sworn to uphold.

A Pennsylvania Partnership
which brings into the same house
the men and women of labor and
business, of government and edu-
cation, of cities and suburbs, of
factories and farms.

A Pennsylvania Partnership
which knows that ifthe sun does
not rise for all of us, it will surely
set on most of us.

What is our agenda?

First, we mustrjoin together the
public and private sectors in a
great program of job creation and
economic opportunity. I will lead

. this effort personally, and we will

act boldly, and with confidence.
We will not fear failure. We will
not shrink from political risk.
We will work together to build
on our strengths: our great univer-
sities and our rich inventory of
private. colleges; our teaching
hospitals and our research
centers, all second to none in the
nation; our world-class skill in
computer software, robotics, bio-
technology, plant automation, di-
amond coating and all the rest.
The day of Pennsylvania's in-
feriority complex shall end. In the
roll cal l of the states we shall take
second place to none. '
' And even as our economy
strengthens, we must agree that
discrimination is an abominat-
tion. We must be_certain that our

    

  
   
     
     
     
     
     
       
 

daughters have as many opportu-
nities as our sons; that our chil-
dren of every color have equal
access to those opportnities. And,
we must act affirmatively to right
ongoing wrongs.

We will change fundamental-
ly the focus of public education ‘
so that our children are prepared
to meet and beat competition
from around the nation, and
around the world. Investment in
human capital is the most impor-
tant investment of all. We will
challenge teachers and students
alike not to be average, but to be
great. The minds of our children
are Pennsylvania's new raw
materials, and we shall not settle
for mediocrity. V

We will not trade away our en-
vironment — and we willclean
up the cancer of toxic waste. We
cannot tolerate pollution as the
price of prosperity. Besides, good
environmental policy is good
economic policy. Business will
not move or stay where water is
undrinkable; so together let us
meet and solve the crisis of taint-
ed rivers and reservoirs. In the
end, our standard of living de-
pends on our quality of life.

Like a good family, we will be
both strong and compassionate.
Good families stay together, grow
together, work together and
move into the future together.
And like any good family, the fa-
mily of Pennsylvania must leave
no one out and leave no one
behind. .

So .we will care about the
homeless in Philadelphia, the un-
employed and the under-
employedin Aliquippa, the han-
dicapped child in Erie, the single

; . mother in Pittsburgh struggling to

lift her children from poverty, and
we will care about the elderly
couple in Scranton, frail and

I alone, too poor to enter.a nurs-'

ing home and too sick to care for-
themselves. ‘

Yes, we are a frugal people, but
we are a caring people, too. And
we want Pennsylvania to be
judged as much by our concern
for our neighbors as by our dedi-
cation to wise management of the
public purse. '

We need not choose between
fiscal prudence and compassion
for the less fortunate among us.
Instead, we will insist that govern-
ment be sensible without being
insensitive.

We must bank the fires of par-
tisan political strife. We must put
aside petty bickering and work

PEKING — Fang Lizhi, an as-
trophysicist who gained national
prominence by standing up for
student demonstrators, was ex-
pelled from the Communist Party
for preaching Western liberal
ideas, the official media reported
Monday.

Fang, 50, was fired last week
from his position as vice presi-
dent of China Science and Tech-
nology University in Hefei.

Fang’s expulsion from the party
came as Zhao Ziyang, the premi-
er and acting party chief, issued
assurances that intellectuals
would not be victimized by
another ideological purge. Zhao
reiterated Deng’s market-oriented
policies that have revolutionized
the economy would continue. .

Zhao became party head Fri-
day after the resignation of Hu
Yaobang, who reportedly was
driven from office because of his
soft handling of student protests
and the growing openness of
criticism of socialism.

The three others are serving sen-
tences of 25 to 60 years for murd-
er or armed robbery.

At Cooper's sentencing, her sis-
ter claimed Paula's father beat her
with extension cords when she
was a child, and their mother

, forced them to join her in an un-

successful suicide attempt. Her
parents did not testify.

Cooper, said Relphorde, has a_
"”child’s mind” and cried after sen-

cal cards given them in jail: ”Give
me the electric chair. Give me that
shock.”

There was speculation, too, by
at least one court official, that
Cooper connived to arouse sym-
pathy by attempting to get preg-
nant. Before sentencing, she
admitted having sex with two jail
guards and a counselor. Deputy

the local party branch decided to
expel Fang on Saturday because
he ”attempted to incite intellec-
tuals against the party and stu-
dents to make trouble, causing
grave consequences.”

The evening news led with a
five—minute segment on an Anhui
province party official citing
Fang’s alleged misdeeds to about
4,000 party officials from local
universities crammed into an au-
ditorium in Hefei, the provincial
capital. ‘ \

The official said Fang denied
Marxism, vilified China's socialist
system as ”modern feudalism”
and called for independence of
universities from party
leadership.

He was accused of ”advocating
bourgeois democracy and free-
dom and instigating students to
make trouble.”

Fang, a graduate of Peking
University who became one of
China's pioneer researchers in
laser theory, gained a nationwide
reputation for speaking out for
greater democracy and pointing
out anomalies in the socialist
system.

. prosecutorlohn Burke said Coop-

er might have thought pregnancy
would help her avoid theedeath
penalty.

At her sentencing, Cooper ex-
pressed bitterness, saying people
had turned their backs on her and
suggesting she was being
punished for failing to lie, while

her cohorts held back ”the.whole .

story” about their roles in the
murder. ”How would you all feel
when I am in my grave?” she
asked

But she expressed remorse,

do it. Sorry isn't good enough for
me. And sorry isn't good enough
for you. ‘

’’I hope that one day I can get
out and start my life over. 
Maybe I can finish school. Will
I have a chance?"

Editor's Note -— Sharon Cohen

is the AP Midwest" regional
reporter, based in Chicago. e

Deng Xiaoping, China's senior
leader, last year encouraged such
forthright opinions, saying great-
er freedom of expression was
needed to invigorate China's
modernization drive.

But Fang ran into trouble when
he supported the goals, but not
the means, of Hefei students who
staged the first in what came to
be a nationwide wave of demon-
strations advocating democracy.

He was heralded as a hero
when tens of thousands of stu-
dents massed in Shanghai in mid-
December.

The government, meanwhile,
continued its relentless campaign
against ”bourgeois liberaliza-
tion,” the questioning of the su-
periority of socialism and the
party, while stating that Deng’s
economic reforms will continue
and intellectuals need ‘not fear
persecution.

Zhao, in a meeting with Hun- - S

Secretary Ferenc Havasi on Sun-
day, asserted Hu’s ouster ’’will
not affect our line and policies
but will enable us to implement
them more correctly,” Xinh_ua
reported Monday.

He said China will not return
to ”leftist” practices of the past,

Thornburg ends successful term in office

HARRISBURG — Gov. Dick
Thornburgh ends eight years in
office this week leaving behind a

‘state government flush with

money and a renewed self—image.
The former U.S. attorney who
rode a crusade against corruption
and waste into the executive
mansion in 1979 feels he has
made good on his promise ”to
give the taxpayer a better return
on his or her dollar.”
Republicans and the business
community tend to applaud the
Thornburgh years as a turning

ment: personal and business tax-
es fell, billions of dollars in
government costs were cut, in-

ruined the legacy of the previous.

Vania,” said Senate Republican
Leader John Stauffer of Chester
County. ”There’s been forward
movement all the way.”
Taking the opposing view,
Democrats, union leaders and
others Thornburgh regards as spe-
cial interests feel his administra-
tion was bent on saving money
at the expense of providing some

needed services. Two examples I

were staff shortages in the depart-
ments that decided workmen’s
compensation cases an_d welfare
benefits.

When his administration was
convinced to adopt such pro-
grams as one that uses lottery
funds to pay for senior citizens’
prescriptions, Thornburgh irked
Democrats by taking credit for
the idea.

”I would characterize the
Thornburgh administration as
having no hits, no runs and no er-
rors,” said Rep. Robert O'Don-
nell, D—Philadelphia, a House
leader

together for the common good of
our state and its people. I pledge
to all the members of the Gener-
al Assembly, of both parties, an
open door and a spirit of respect
andcooperation. And I ask the
same of them. It is time for us to
talk, and to listen, together.

And, through the politics of ci-

vility, as we build a new era of
cooperation between governor
and legislature, we will be able
to improve the system of justice.
-Our system must provide judges
who are competent and fair;
hard—working and incorruptible.
Our people must have confi-
dence in the integrity and swift-
nessof the judicial process.

So, too, in an‘ era of political ci-
vility, the state and local govern-
ments should be able to find
common ground to improve the

If state government's role is to
help people who can't help
themselves or intervene to boost
an ailing economy, ”then obvi-
ously Dick Thornburgh has struck
out,” O'Donnell said.

During the Thornburgh years,

Pennsylvania saw its steel indus-
try collapse and hundreds of
thousands of well—paying jobs
disappear. The governor em-
braced President Reagan’s eco-
nomic plans in 1981 even as the
state was enduring a severe reces--
sion. .
’’It cost me, no question about
that,” Thornburgh said in an in-
terview last week. ”It was a very
difficult year economically and a
very difficult year for Republican
candidates. I was one of the few
survivors.” . '

But Thornburgh is convinced
that strategies his administration
adopted, formation of the Ben
Franklin Partnership for one,
combined with his tight-fisted fis-
cal policies have set the state on

flexibility and fairness of the sys-
tem under which local govern-
ments provide for their revenues.

And, finally, cooper_ation and
good will must become the Penn-
sylvania practice between labor
and management. It is time for
both sides at the table to give
more than they take, to meet
each other more than half the dis-
tance in the interests of all of us.

- Those, then, are the great
challenges of the new Pennsylva-
nia Partnership. a

We remember that, as a mar-
tyredpresident said on a cold
January day, a quarter century
ago: All of these things will not-
be accomplished in the first

‘ hundred days, nor perhaps even

during the life of this administra-
tion. But let us begin.
So, we begin. Here. Today.

the right course.

’’I have to take considerable
satisfaction that, as I leave office,
we have a record number of peo-
ple at work, unemployment is at
a 12-year low, we have seen
500,000 new jobs created 
We're outperforming the nation-
al economy,” he said.

Among the other statistics com-
piled by the Thornburgh adminis-
tration: the personal income tax
was cut to 2.1 percent after in-
creasing to 2.45 percent in the
1983-84 budget year; the cor-
porate net income tax was cut
from 10.5 to 8.5 percent; 90 per-
cent prepayment of corporate tax-

es was abolished; the number of _

state employees was reduced by
15,000; and operating costs were
slashed by $6.1 billion.

Instead of leaving the state in
red ink, as did the two preceed-
ing governors, Thornburgh
projects more than a $200 mil-
lion surplus at the end of the fis-
calyean

 

Our cause is nothing less than
to redeem the promise of Penn-

sylvania for ourselves and our ,

children - and their children yet

to be born. Our cause is nothing _
.less than the creation of a new

Pennsylvania, rooted in our long
and rich heritage, striving for a fu-
ture of greater prosperity and
justice for all.

Along the way, in countless de-
bates and decisions, let this be
our guiding star: to build a Penn-
sylvania future worthy of our peo-
ple and our past. What I pledge
to you — what I ask of all of us
3 is a constant commitment to in-
itiative and innovation, and to the
enduring values of family, com-
munity and concern for one
another.

So let the great Pennsylvania

Partnership begin.

Slip, Slidin’ Away

St. John's put the clamps on Pitt playerslCharles Smith and Jerome Lane in Monday night's 63-62 loss at the Fitzgerald Field House. Pitt is now 13-4, 2-2.

Pittcan’t take St John's, loses 63-62

By Christopher Sepesy
Assistant Sports Editor

”In basketball, there are good
nights and there are bad nights.
Tonight was one of the latter. We

just didn't have a good game,”,

said Pitt head coach Paul Evans.
Yet another game and Evans
had to issue such a statement to

the press after suffering a disap-, A

painting loss by one point to the
St. John’s Redmen, 63-62. What
makes this particular loss some-
what hard to take is that it seems
it could have been prevented if

I it weren't for obvious mistakes

made by the Panther team.
And most prominently, mis-
takes made by Pitt star player
Charles Smith.
”Obviously, Charles didn't
have_ a good game,” said Evans.
Smith's’ performance in Mon-
day night's game was far less than
normal for his usual high-caliber

play. In the first half of the game, ’

 

—l\/larshall Clark/The Pitt News

he had three shots swatted down
by St. John's center Terry Brass,
and in the last four seconds of the
game, he missed an 8-foot jump
shot —- a shot" that, if made,

A would have given the Panthers a

one—point victory. Instead, it was
the other way around.

”On that last play, we tried to
get Charles across for a screen so

we could get the pass to him,”

said Pitt point guard Mike Good-
son. ”The thing is is that he didn't
get it in.” ' '

Goodson continued, ”The
thing is that for Charles it was just
one of those games. Nobody can
play great all of the time. What
he has to do, and really, what we
all have to do, is just listen up and
do what the coach wants us to
do. He only tells us what is
right.”

Coodson, who had probably .

what was his best game in his en-
tire college career thus far, scored

 

a team high of 15 points and
seemed to have regained the con-
fidence which critics have been
speculating was gone. He played
very well, and he knows he
played very well, but it is the loss

‘and how it happened which sad-

dens him.

“Those are the things I'm dis-
appointed about,” said Goodson.
”The guys played well all the
way. They executed what I told
them. Then in the last four poses-
sions it all just fell apart.”

During the first half, and before
a sellout crowd of 6,798 which

" seemed to want blood, the Pan-
- thers seemed as if they, had noth-

ing to worry about. Except for the
downed balls of Smith, Pitt basi-
cally had command of both the
offense and defense, especially
because of the amazing talents of
Jerome Lane. Going-into the lock-

Wednesday, January 21, T987

It was the second halfwhich I

changed everything.

In a little under four minutes of
play, Coach Lou Carnesecca’s
Redmen made '11 points to the
Panthers’ four, and from that
point on, Pitt was no longer able
to take command of the game.

”Some people say I'm notori-
ous for being able to take a
downed team into the locker
room at halftime and breathe
new energy into them,” said Car-
nesecca. ”Whether this is true, I
don’t know. All I know is that
what I said to them in the locker
room, well, let's just say I made
some suggestions.”

”During the first half, they [Pitt]
were hurting us on the boards

‘and on the fast breaks,” con-

tinued Carnesecca. ”What we

did was slow the tempo down so V

we could eventually control it as
‘we wanted it. And it was ‘Marco
Baldi’s- three-point plays _whi‘ch

really kept us in the ball game.”

St. John's players Shelton Jones .

(forward) and Mark Jackson

(guard) each said it was the slow-'
ing of the tempo which allowed

the Redmen to move in and final-
ly take the ball game.

”What we needed to do was » '
stop letting the Panthers under.-
the boards so they could get out, V 
so fast,” said Jones. ”Jerome Lane

was really hurting us.”
Pitt is now 13-4 overall and 2-2

in the Big East, while StJohn’s is !
13-2 overall and44-2 in the con-_
ference. The Panthers’ next game ._

is Saturday against Boston Col-
lege. In reference. to the re-
mainder of the season, Coach

St. John’sguard Jackson steers
Carnesecca’s Big Red Machine

By Thomas Danyluk

Assistant Sports Editor

Let it be known that Pitt guard
Michael Goodson played one of
the best games of his life in the
Panthers’ 63-62 loss to St. John's.
He revealed a shooting accuracy
not previously revealed to the
Pittsburgh public. He handled the
ball flawlessly, whipping that ol’
MacGregor around the Redmen
zone like a pinball wizard. It was
undoubtedly a great effort from
the sophomore.

Too bad for the Panthers that
Mark Jackson was there to see,
then steal, the show.

The St. John's point guard
turned in a stellar, yet ever-so-
typical performance in guiding
his team to its 13th win.

Five assists, 16 points and only
two turnovers in his 40 minutes
of action. No rests for this guy.
Louie C. needed him out there to
put his volatile Redmen and ”the
kid Goodson” where he wanted
them.

”Mark did it all tonight,” said
Carnesecca. ”He knows how to
keep our offense underrcontrol,
but also controlled their [Pitt's]
tempo in the second half, slowed
down their break. This guy just
did a great, great job.”

”You know, I look at the great
players and say, ’They do what it
takes to win,’ ” Jackson
remarked. ’’I could tell things
were stalling offensively, so I
decided what needed to be done.
I had to supply some offensive
firepower.”

Firepower? Sniper duty is a
more accurate description of
Jackson's contribution, who in-
cidentally scored his 1,000th

career point early in the second

half.

Granted, Jackson's overall stats
didn’t_ raise even Alan Cutler’s
eyebrows, but this was a matter
of timing, not flashy quantity.
Remember, Jackson is Louie's
field general; His work goes on
behind the front lines. And be-

‘ application and information

l.Q00O00OOOQ0oooooooo9ooopooooooooooooooooooooooop,

 

Let's go back to the 4:37 mark
of the second half. Pitt held ‘a
three point advantage over SJU,
and the revenge—starved crowd
was making things awfully
difficult for the stubborn visitors.

. The home-court advantage was at

its best. Screaming alumni, bark-
ing cheerleaders, roaring stu-
dents. Just blaring, frenzied noise
— and then silence, as Jackson
drilled a shot from near Free-Trip-
to—San—Fran range. Thus, a tie ball
game at 57 a piece. Take it from
there, Mark.

”l was aware the shot-clock
was running down. I got the ball
with eight or nine seconds, then
when I looked again, it was down
to five. It's not a shot I make

everyday, but it went in,” he said. ,

Mark, it wasn't a jumper Larry
Bird makes everydav.

”That was just an unbelievable
shot,” said the raspy Carnesecca.
”Those three points kept us in the
ball game.”

The Jackson—Goodson -back—'

court matchup proved to be the
‘night's most interesting. The
proven, experienced senior ver-
sus a struggling pupil still learn-

ing the point position. And

Goodson held his own for the en-
tire first half, contributing 11
points and directing a Panther
break that beat St. John's down-
court more times than not.

Enough of that, Louie said. _

Jackson, he's all yours. If they're
going to beat us, Goodson’s got-
ta beat you first.

And Jackson responded, limit-
ing Goodson to four points in the
second half, while hounding him

‘incessantly with tight, full-court

pressure.

”We had to develop some
pride on defense. They were
scoring almost at will in the first
half. Then, we came out of the

' locker room and held. them to-

22,” he said. ‘/50 I tried to give
him [Goodson] pressure, tried to
slow him down. That helped
slow their entire offense.”

”Mark played me tough. He's
a really good player,” Coodson
said. ’’But I wasn't out there in
awe. l"”c'an see myself being that
caliber of a guard when l’m.a
senior.”

If that proves to be true, Pitt is
going to be one lucky basketball
team“two years from now.

Making the grade

Jenny Shingler

(361 Carri 60' away -  

 Scott Cornohon/The Pitt News

     

By Matt O'Hara
Staff Writer

Deciding where to attend col-
lege is generally not an easy de-
cision to make. Being a Street &
Smith Al|—America basketball
player on a national champion-
ship team doesn’t make the
choice any less difficult.

Last year, Jen Shingler, aform-
er- standout guard for Altoona
High School, knew such a
predicament.

’’I had it narrowed down to
three schools: Pitt, Penn State and
Boston University,” said Shingler,
a starter for the Lady Panthers
basketball team. _

Why Pitt? ’’I think she chose
Pitt because it was close enough
to home that she could get there
without much problem, but far
enough away that she knew she
wasn't at home," said Lady Pan-
ther basketball head coach Kirk
Bruce.

Perhaps Bruce is underestimat-
inghis abilities as a recruiter.
”Probably the biggest reason I
came to Pitt was Coach Bruce,”
said Shingler.

”The three schools I looked at

were even, academically," Shin-

gler added. "I knew that the ‘

teams in the Big East would pro-
vide a higher level of compe-
tition.”

Shingler has definitely found
this estimation to be true. The
Lady Panthers recently fell to St.
John's, losing their sixth confer-
ence game in as many tries.

For Shingler, however, it was
her best performance of the year.
She led the team in scoring with
22 points, and at one time in the
game was 12 for 12 from the free
throw line.

”The St. John's game was im-
portant for Jen. She just went out
and played. She's getting the
freshman mistakes out of her sys-
tem,” said Bruce. '

”The girls are so much stronger
and faster than in high school,”

Shingler passing hertest as a leader for Lady Panthers

said Shingler. ”The game is a lot

more_comp|ex, too. At Altoona,‘

l was a shooting guard, and that's
about all I did —- shoot.” .

Both Shingler and Bruce be-
lieve that although the adjust-
ment is not easy, she is making
it. ”With Jen, it's a mental thing.
Once she totally believes she's
the best player on the floor, she'll

‘be able to do the things we know

she can,” claims Bruce.

In 15 games, Shingler has
scored 143 points, averagingjust
under 10 per game. She is shoot-
ing 75 percent from the free
throw line, making 44 on 59 at-
tempts. She is only one steal shy
leader Valerie
Halesworth, who has 24.

”Jen is a very dedicated ball-
player. She's fighting real hardjto
help turn the team around; we're
real pleased to have her,” said
Bruce. "

Although the rest of this season
is uncertain for Shingler and the
Lady Panthers, next year brings

with it possibly the best freshman

class in the team's history.

Shingler is excited about the
new players coming in-, but she
does not want to look any further
than the games which lie ahead
this season. '

Although midterms are still a
few weeks away, it is now mid-
season in the Panther basketball
team-’s schedule. After Monday
night's unfortunate loss to the St.
John's Redmen, Pitt's overall
record stands at 13-4 and in the
Big East at 2-2.,

But the loss records sometimes
do and sometimes don't stand as
good evaluators of performances
made by certain groups or in-
dividuals.

With this column, I hope to
present an unbiased and fair
evaluation of just how the team
is coming along now that it is in
mid-season. The performances of
first—year head coach Paul Evans,
certain individuals, and finally,
the team as a whole will be
evaluated.

COACH PAUL EVANS -
When compared to his predeces-
sor, this man seems like MacAr-
thur returned to the Phillipines.
Although he has instituted enor-
mous changes in strategy and dis-
cipline, his team at times still
seems a little unhinged. What it
seems he needs to do now is take
the potential talents of his play-
ers, which could amount to be
gargantuan in proportion, and
add a little glue to them.
GRADE — B+

CHARLES SMITH — Yes,
Charles Smith has shown in the
past he can do magic with a
basketball. Yes, Charles Smith
has proven he is truly a great

cause of all of his athletic talents

combined. But where the hell are
they this year? Although he is do-
ing a passable job, he certainly is
not playing what some said
would be ”the cream of the Big
East.” Sorry Charlie, can't give
you the grade you want and
should have. GRADE — C+
CURTIS AIKEN — Aiken, like
Smith, has great potential. But
also like Smith, he'd better learn
the idea of the team sport. Curtis
is probably the best shooter the
Panthers have. A little more work
would cut out all of the bad and
un—needed mistakes. But as of
late, he has been showing humili-
ty in his play, which saves his
grade. GRADE — B- ~
MIKE GOODSON — From the
ashes of disaster grow the roses
of success. Mike has dragged
himself up from the dregs of no-
points-scored to taking almost full
command of the team when it is
on the court. Although a little
more work may be required, you
can be confident Goodson will
do it. Perseverance, Mike, ‘per-
severance. GRADE —— B+
DEMETREUS GORE — If I
could give an ”A” for effort, Gore
would probably get it. I don't
know what is wrong with his per-
formance, however. Perhaps he
should be hitting the boards more
or just stepping back before he
acts too soon — I don't know. He
chnuld be able to shrug off this

Basketball team won't make this dean's list

slump, but one hopes it will be
soon. Congratulations are in ord-
er for his I,O0Oth scored point in
the Chicago State game.
GRADE — B-

I IEROME LANE— Nobody has
a better ball sense than this man.
He is everywhere he has to be
when he has to be there and then
some. Bottom line — Lane is
proving himself the best player
Pitt has. GRADE —— A

PAT CAVANAUGH — Hooray
for the little guy! As a freshman
walk-on player, Cavanaugh is
breaking all tradition by playing
the way he is. He is tough,
demanding and has a lot of
spunk. So what if his game is
freshman-like in appearance; I
have a feeling this kid is going to
be someone to watch.

GRADE — B+

TICO COOPER — Tico is the
kind of player who does what he
has to do, or at least tryshis best
to do so. His game is not great,
but it's not all that bad, either. If
anything, he is certainly the most
spirited player on the team.
GRADE — B

STEVE MASLEK — Too bad we
have not been able to see much
of Steve, but he certainly was im-
pressive in the Chicago’ State
game. -It shows definite improve-
ment since the beginning of the
season when Evans commented,
-”Steve is a good player, but he is
so slow that I feel I have to stand
center court and pass out sand-
wiches in the time it takes him to
get from one end to the other.”
Keep on truckin’. GRADE —- B-

RICH CARRIGAN — Carrigan
has got to watch the stupid mis-
takes he seems prone to make.
Otherwise, he's gutting it out like
the best of them. And as to Rich
not playing much —— his day will
come. GRADE — B-

WALK-ON PLAYERS: SCOTT
COLOMBO, IOHN LUTHER,
BILLY OSBORN, IOHN RASP -
Perhaps Evans should re—evaluate
his thoughts on using these guys.
In the proverbial sense, they are
coming up the hard way, but very
well nonetheless. With Rasp hav-
ing the size, Osborn having the
power, Colombo having the
speed and Luther having what
seems to be superb talent, they
provide a foundling but tough
bench strength. In all, they are
doing the best they can in the cir-
cumstances they are in.
GRADE — A-

Overall, it seems some should
continue what they are doing
while others need definite re-
defining. Now that the team has
had about six tastes of what true
power play is, hopefully they will

adapt to its environment. If not, »

we might as well be back in the
days’ of ”Roy’s Boys.” They
should know by now they cannot
take ”big” games down to the
wire and that they have to learn
how to control the court so that
they may prevent a situation like
this from happening. In other
words, they shouldn't gamble
away their opportunities.

The team gets an average grade
of B- with sincere hopes that it
will jump up a few notches by
the end of the season.

Emore keeping family tradition

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writer

The name Emore is not new to
the Panther’s top—gun swimming
tradition.

Jim Emore, now ajunior, holds

the fastest time for the 100—yard.

butterfly in the Big East Confer-
ence so far this year. But Emore
is actually a Pitt swimming lega-
cy. He was proceeded by his
older brother Geoff, who was a
valuable cog in the Panthers’ win-
ning machine a few years ago.

Emore attributes his easyVtran—
sition from high school into Pitt's
swimming and academic pro-
grams to his older brother's
guidance and good example.

”When I came to Pitt and
‘swam in my freshman year, it was
the first time my brother and I
were ever on the same team,”
said Emore. ”It was great. I al-
ready knew a lot of the guys on
the team and a lot about the pro-
gram from him.”

He added, ”There was no com-
petitive tension between us. We

encouraged each other a lot. I S

benefited greatly from his ex-
perience, and he helped me
through a lot that first year.”

Jim's nickname, ”Litt|e Mo,”
contrasted the nickname the team
gave his senior brother, ”Big
M0.” The Little Mo name still sur-
vives to this day, even though his
big brother has long since depart-
ed from the Pitt swimming scene.

Men's swimming coach Fred
Lewis remembers Emore as a
very talented but scrawny swim-
mer when he came to Pitt three
years ago.

”He.was a talented kid coming‘
in but needed a lot of develop-
ment. We've added a lot -of
strength and endurance to him
over the years,” said Lewis. ”If he

continues to work hard this sea-
son, train over the summer and
do well again next season, he has
the potential to be at the Olym-
pic trials in 1988.”

Looking to goals closer at hand

though, Emore hopes the team.

can pull out a win over long time
rival Penn State next weekend.

”Well, the Miami Hurricanes
lost to Penn State in the bowl
game, so now it's our duty to
bring them down in swimming,”
Emore stated. ”Seriously, though,
our teams are fairly equal in all
aspects. Everyone will have to
swim fantastically for us to win.
It will be more of a team effort
than an individual one.”

Emore also hopes to do well at
the Eastern Seaboards and Big
East Championships, which are
his only two shots at qualifying
for the prestigious NCAA cham-
pionships. He has never qualified
for the NCAAS, but this may be
the year he does.’ -

So far, his preliminary 100—yard
butterfly time is less than a 10th
of a second away from qualifying.
He is merely one second away
from qualifying for an All-
American time.

Winning at the Big East is
something Emore has experi-
enced both his freshman and
sophomore years, being the 100-
yard butterfly champ both years.
According to Emore, competing
in big championship meets is

something you improve at the_

more you.do it.

”The more times you swim in
championship meets, the more
relaxed you become with it and
the smarter you swim,” said
Emore. ”I-always_ give it my all
and- hope for. the best.” '

Even with a swimmer as good
as .Emore, there is always room
for improvement. Coach Lewis

states two things that have ham-
pered Emore from performing at
his optimum level this year.

”He was held back slightly this
year due to a torn [lateral] mus-
cle he suffered earlier in the sea-
son. There is always the fear of
pressing it too much and tearing
it again,” said Lewis.

”We need to work more on his
endurance factor though. He has
all the speed it takes to go out

fast, but he needs the endurance '

to bring it home in the same
fashion,” added Lewis.

Emore is a communications
major from Churchville, Pa. He
started swimming in a non-
competitive summer league pro-
gram at age 5 and progressed
from there, usually following in
his brother's footsteps.

At Council Rock High School,
Emore was.a successful finisher
consistenly at the state champion-
ships both in the 100-yard butter-
fly and 100-yard backstroke. As

A a high school senior, he became

a first _team High School All-
American..

Emore of course enjoys swim-
ming, but also the Pitt campus
and his fellow teammates as well.

. ”There are a great bunch of-
guys on the team. I look up to a
lot of them,” said Emore. ”We’re
competitive in practice, and that
helps everyone swim faster.
There is a lot of team unity here.
We are all very supportive of
each other and can really pull
together in a_big meet.”

Emore said the butterfly stroke
has» always come naturally to
him. He swims the difficult stroke
with unbelievable agility and

"strength. Cloach "Lewis probably

sums_this up best when he said,
"The Emore brothers probably
have one of the most beautiful fly
strokes around." -

gymnasts in first meet

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's gymnastics team
had their first home meet Satur-
day against Eastern Michigan.
The Panthers came away with an
impressive 243.0 to‘165.95 vic-
tory, despite inconsistent officiat-
ing and several disputed calls.

Head coach Frank D’Amico
said, ”For our first meet, we per-

, formed well. We're a young

team, and we have a good future..

Overall, I thought the scores were
low, and the judges were tdligh.
But we have two weeks to pre-
pare for our next meet.”

The Panthers’ best events were

the vault, the floor exercise and
the still rings. Jorge Gonzalez, Pat
Pollaci and Jorge Sanchez were
the top vaulters, while Sanchez,
Brock Freehling and Steve
Powanda scored highest in the
floor exercise. Strong perfor-
mances on the still rings came
from Dan Tarosky, Marty Comi-
ni, Pollaci and Gonzalez.

Pitt's highest all-around in-
dividual scorer was freshman
Gonzalez, who had an impres-
sive 52.05 composite score.” —

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 21,. I987

Some sporting thoughts in this  the bleak midwinter

I went through a rather severe
trauma a few weeks ago. I start-
ed thinking that the entire sport-
ing world was nuts. It seemed
crazy. I mean, it was total disil-
lusionment time.

The Super Bowl countdown is
boring me to tears; North Caroli-
na, the Boston Celtics, the
Philadelphia Flyers, Syracuse and
the Cleveland Force are in first
place as usual. That's bad
enough, right? '

I thought so too. Then I get to-
day's Pittsburgh Press and turn to
the sports page. I was hoping to
find some more tasteful Press
headlines, but what I did find was
something far worse. I thought

sports as we know it was over.
There were on articles on Art
Schlichter — his college coach,
Earle Bruce, said Schlicter ”has a
real sickness.” I think Bruce me-
ans Schlichter has a bad allergic
reaction to money, and he must
part with it as soon as possible.
”Lucky” Art was arrested in Indi-
anapolis last week for gambling,
and he now faces criminal
charges. If Schlicter does have a
gambling problem, he should
seek out a cure. Simple as that.

Then there was a piece on
former Penguin ”Spinner”
Spencer being arrested in Florida
and charged with kidnapping and
murder, stemming from the 1982

BOB TRAVERS

death of a West Palm Beach
businessman. Spencer had only
80 goals in a 10-year NHL career.
Now he has something else to
brag about to his grandchildren.

Another article detailed the
millions of dollars to be bet on
this week's Super Bowl. Another

was about Mike Ditka’s plans in,

the wake of the firing of Bears
general manager Jerry Vainisi.
The president of the Bears,

Michael McCaskey, dismissed
Vainisi because of ”philosophical
differences.” But Vianisi said he
still considers himself the Bears
GM since he has time remaining
on his contract. The matter will
likely end up in court. There was

‘a mention of a brawl which broke

out during a basketball game be-
tween Missouri and Oklahoma, a
women's basketball game. Now
I know why feminists would
rather have them called women's
teams instead of ladies.
Remember when the sports
pages used to have articles on
games and players’ performances
and things?
Neither do I.

  $2 ALI. OTHERS  

Well, rather than just sit back
and suffer through all this degra-
dation of what was once noble
athletics, I decided to take mat-
ters into my own hands and in-
vent some sports.

I am now the commisioner of
the Apartment-Dorm Room In-
door Basketball League, the Wall
Baseball Association and the or-
ganizer and sponsor of such
events as the SuperBall Catching
Tournament. But what I am most
proud of is Olympic Refrigerator
Magnet Throwing.

I'm serious about this. It has all
the ingredierits of a sport whose
time has come. It's simple and
cheap. All you have to do is buy
several refrigerator magnets. They
only cost about 79 cents. Then
you need to buy a refigerator.
They only cost about $800. Al-
ready the sport is a lot cheaper
than playing hockey for a season.
The rules are so easy, even a non-
CAS student could understand
them. Each player stands a
prescribed distance from the
fridge (10-15 feet) and tosses his
magnet. A player gets 20 tosses
per game. The player throwing
the most magnets sticking to the
refrigerator is the-winner of the
game. A player must win four of
seven games to win a match. The
player who wins the most

matches by the end of the season

is the champion.

It's also exciting, and there is
no way to cheat. I will never for-
get that overtime fifth game Mike
and Pat played last year. Wow! It
took 32 tosses before we had a
winner. I have that match‘ on
videotape. We watch it at parties
and things. It is sport at its finest.

Right now, I'm going to forget
about Ditka, Spencer, Missouri,
Oklahoma and Oliver North and
go home, put on ESPN pour, my-
self a nice, tall glass of Pepsi and

‘watch the America's Cup. The.

world's most exciting sport. After

Going strong

Wrestlers continue winning streak, beat
Ashland College for seventh straight win

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

Time was running out, and the
fans were cheering madly.

Pitt wrestler Matt Rizzo was
only one point away from a tie.
There was a mad struggle, and
the buzzer went off. One look at
the scoreboard confirmed that he
just couldn't pull it off. The Ash-
land Eagles had won the first
match 6-5 to take a 3-0 lead over
the undefeated Panther wrestling
team.

However, this didn't calm the

people in the stands. They were _

equally as loud when the wres-

' tlers got ready for the next match.

in this match, Pitt's Matt Gerhard

‘ won a technical fall to give the

Panthers six points. It was a lead
they never surrendered, and the
Pitt wrestling team extended its
overall record to 7-0.

”This was not the best we have
looked,” said Pitt head coach

V Rande Stottlemyer. ’’It seemed

that some of our guys had trou-
ble getting up for this meet. We

trained hard but just were not that 6

effective."
Ashland was able to get six of

their 13 points by the third
match. The scormivas tied at six,

‘ R. Scotf”.Carn'aha_ln/The  News

 

and the surrounding tension was
evident. But that lasted only un-
til Pitt’s star All-America Pat San-
toro stepped up.

At one point, Santoro did not
seem up to his usual par and was
even behind. But eventually he
pulled himself together and won
the match 21-8. At this point, Pitt
was up 11-6, and they were not
threatened for the rest of the
meet. '

The next match was forfeited to
Pitt wrestler Gary Bolin, giving
the Panthers six extra points.

The suspense of who was go-
ing to wrestle in the following
match added extra excitement for
the crowd, which already had
proved itself a captive audience.
Before the meet, two wrestlers

-were announced, Eric Wertz and

Jeff Turner, and no one was real-
ly sure who was going to con-
tend. Finally, Wertz walked out,
and took the match 14-3. Pitt was
now up 21-6, and there was lit-
tle doubt who was going to win
the meet.

_ ”Pat Santoro and Eric Wertz
wrestled well,” said Stottlemyer.
”But not as good as they usually
do.”

The last matches were won by
Panther wrestlers Jeff Turner, with
a win of 14-0,and Chris Nufher,

Matt Gerhard A
with a win of 10-0. The matching

of Nufher and Ashland wrestler 1

Bill Blum was, according to Stott-

- lemyer, somewhat incorrect be-

cause of Blum’s weight — 50
pounds heavier than Nufher.

~ The match was pretty much

touch and go for the first couple
of minutes, and at one point,
Blum took the lead. However, it
didn't last long as Nufher came
back to tie and eventually, to get
the lead. He ended up winning
5-4, to make the final score Pitt
29, Ashland 13. . ’

”This win was fun for ourffirstlh ,
home meet,” said -Stottlemyer.

”]eff Turner and Chris Nufher

. were the stars of the day by beat-

ing guys who were much heavi-

er than them. All in all, I hope we’
keep progressing the way we

have been all season.”

Bears’ coach Ditkathreatensto leave
after his contract runs out next season

BOSTON (AP) — Chicago
Bears head coach Mike Ditka has
told his bosses he will not return
after the 1987 season because of
a dispute over the team's firing of
its general manager, according to
a newspaper report published
Sunday.

The Boston Sunday Globe said
Ditka told team president
Michael McCaskey of his inten-
tions after McCaskey refused to
rehire general manager Jerry
Vainisi, whom he fired last week
from the National Football
League team.

”Then this season is my last,”
Ditka is reported as saying.

”Don’t even bother to ask me
about signing an extension of my
contract, because I won't do it.”

After the conversation, Ditka
reportedly told his assistant
coaches that 1987 would be his
last season with the Bears, and if
they wanted, they were free to
start looking for new jobs im-
mediately.

But McCaskey said Sunday that
Ditka has not indicated to him
that he won't be coaching the
Bears after his contract ends in
1987, according to Brian Harlan,
a Bears spokesman. Ditka report-
edly was on vacation and not

available for comment.

McCaskey also said Ditka had
not resigned, Harlan said.

The Globe said Ditka was
”fuming” because Vainisi is his
best friend and Ditka’s strongest
ally in Chicago's front office.

”Ditka and Jerry are best of
friends,” according to an uniden-
tified source 'quoted by the
newspaper. ”When the ’big four’
[Ditka, McCaskey, Vainisi and
personnel director Bill Tobin] got
together, Jerry usually backed
Ditka. This is what happened
with [Doug] Flutie, and
McCaskey didn't like it. It hap-

pened three or four times, and
McCaskey wasn't happy about
It.”

McCaskey said he dismissed
Vainisi because of ”philosophical
differences.” He said Vainisi is
still a consultant.

Vainisi, however, still considers
himself the team's general
manager and has two years left
on the contract given to him by
George Halas in 1983.

”Jerry’s lawyer told him to keep
on goingto tl‘..-2 office and doing
his job,” the source said. ”So that
is what he is going to do. The
whole thing is-a mess.”

PASADENA, Calif. -— Just be-
fore the New York Giants and
Denver Broncos take to the field
in Sunday's Super Bowl, they
might thank Bum Phillips, Ge-
orge Steinbrenner and Robert
lrsay.

All three helped them get there.

Both the Giants and Broncos
were built the classic way —-— solid
drafts by solid organizations with
a few judicious trades.’ But Phil-

 And you thought theheadbands were bad

By Tom Canavan

\‘ AP Sports Writer

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. —-
Think you know the roster of the
New York Giants as they head
into the Super Bowl?

Well, try these names: Tunnel,
Cinnamon, Sluggo, Biff, Billy-
Body, Pepper, Toast, Slick and
Tuna. ‘

’’If you're thin-skinned, you're

not going to last long on this
team,” Giants Coach Bill Parcells
said. »
That's especially true when it
comes to handing out nicknames,
and Parcells is the biggest in-
stigator.

Not every Giants’ player has
gotten a nickname - from the

coach of the NFC champions, but '

some may pick one up as the
team prepares for Sunday's NFL

title game against the Denver .

Broncos at Pasadena, Calif.

For the record, Parcells is
”Tuna,” a name some players in-
sist was earned after a number of
bad nights at the card table.

IIP THEBE WITH THE BEST OF THE BEST.

‘Tn-—-:.2.§._.u~'§

Taylor. Steinbrenner and lrsay
combined to get John Elway to
Denver, without whom the rest of
the Broncos’ players might be
watching the Super Bowl on tel-
evision.

In 1981, the Giants, coming off
a 4-12 ‘sesaon, had the second
draft choice and like 26 other
teams, coveted Taylor, the North
Carolina linebacker.

The only one who didn't was
the team with the first pick, New
Orleans. Phillips wanted to build
around an Earl Campbell-like run-

— ”I eat tuna every day, that's
how I got it,” Parcells main-
tained.

The offensive line seems to be
the most nicknamed group. It
reads, from left tackle to right:
Bebo (Brad Benson), Biff (Billy
Ard), Bart Oates, Tunnel (Chris
Godfrey) and Cinnamon (Karl

'Nelson).

”He has tried with me,” said
Oates, the center. ”He «hasn't
found anything suitable. There
have been many futile attempts;
one I'm definitely not going to
mention.”

Benson and Ard got their nick-
names from other players.
”Bebo” is simply a shorter way
of saying Brad Benson. Ard’s
”Biff” relates more to his postsea-
son job.

”Biff fitsbeing a stockbroker,”
Nelson said. ,”It’s a Yuppie
name.”

Parcells dubbed Nelson ”Cin’-C 

namon” last year after the tackle
blew a play. ,

”I was cussing myself out, and
he said, ’What’sthe matter, did

ning back and spurned trade
offers, taking George Rogers as
the No. 1 pick.

The impact was immediate e
Taylor, becoming NFL Defensive
Player of the Year in his rookie
season, led the Giants to their first
playoff berth in 16 years. This
season, he became the second
defensive player in history to be-
come the NFL’s MVP, leading
them to their first Super Bowl.

Jump ahead two years.

Like everyone preparing for the _

1983 draft, the Broncos coveted

your honey forget to put cinna-
mon on your biscuits?’ So for a
while, I was called Cinnamon,”
Nelson said.’

Godfrey got the name ”Tun-
nel” from Parcells because of his
alleged single-mindedness to de-

n_ickname. Before that, he was
called ”Biscuits,” after also blow-
ing a play.

Godfrey disputes how he got
the nicknames, though.

”As you can tell, when Bill got
here, there were a lot of losing
seasons, and they were 3-12-1 in
his first year,” Godfrey said.
”When I got here, we started
winning, and he called me ‘Tun-
nel’ because he could see the
light at the end of me.”

And ”Biscuits?”

”He called me that becausehe
considers me his bread and but-
ter,” Godfrey said. '

Probably‘ the two most recog-. 

nized nicknames on the Giants

back Elvis Patterson, known as

Elway, rated as the top quarter-
back prospect in a decade. But
they had the fifth pick, and the
then-Baltimore Colts took Elway
with the first choice.

That was a gamble.

Elway, seeking an option and
some leverage in the football
draft, had been signed to a base-
ball contract a year earlier by
Steinbrenner for his New York
Yankees. He played a summer for
Oneonta of the Class A New
York-Penn League and hit -.294,
enough to give him leverage with
the NFL. '

"Toast.”

Johnson got his nickname as a
child. He was sitting at the table
eating cereal while his father was
having dinner. His father put pep-
per on his meal, and his son put
it on his cereal.

Patterson became ”Toast” dur-
ing the Giants’ training camp two
years ago after being beaten on
a number of deep passes.

”One day I was sitting down,
and I saw some balls thrown in
the air, and I decided not to chase
them,” Patterson said. ”From that
day forward, I was known as
’Toast.’ ”

Nose tackle Jim Burt also
picked up his nickname, ”Slug—
go,” in training camp.

”Actually, being a free agent,
you have to fight your way onto
a team,” said Burt, who made All-
Pro_this season. _’’_It seemed every

didn't want to play for the Colts
or for lrsay. Denver packaged
offensive lineman Chris Hinton,
its No. 1 pick, along with quar-
terback Mark Herrmann and its
1984 No. 1 for Elway.

While Hinton has made it to
the Pro Bowl, Elway made the
trade a coup for Denver with just
one drive —— the 98-yarder in the
final five minutes of last week's
AFC title game at Cleveland that
tied the score and set up the over-

Supercoaches Parcells and Reevesare

By Dave Goldberg

AP Football Writer

PASADENA, Calif. —— A year
ago, Bill Parcells was watching a
linebacker named Pepper John-
son work out at the NFL’s evalu-
ation camp for college seniors
when he turned around and saw
Dan Reeves standing behind him.

”You’ve got a pretty good eye
for talent. I just want to watch
who you're watching,” Reeves
told him.

The coaches in next Sunday's
Super Bowl aren't exactly
strangers to each other. In fact,
were it not for a kind of toss-of-
the-coin twist of fate, Reeves
might be coaching the New York

England?

Parcells’ Giants, who arrived
Sunday, began their workouts for
the NFL championship game at
the Los Angeles Rams’ training
complex in Fullerton on Monday.

Reeves’ Broncos arrived later in
the afternoon from, Denver, after
a celebration and pep rally at
Mile High Stadium on Sunday.

‘But Reeves could also have ar-
rived from New York.

It goes back to 1979, when the
Giants were undergoing a com-
plete housecleaning and George
Young had just taken over as
general manager. He narrowed
down the search for a coach to
two young offensive coordinators
— Ray Perkins of San Diego and
Dan Reeves of Dallas.

Young chose Perkins and
Reeves, who had undergone

Haynes," a former All-Pro corner-
back acquired ‘during the off-
season from the Giants, would
wrest a starting job from Mike
Harden and, paired with Louis
Wright, would give Denver two
solid players at the position.

Eighteen games later, Haynes
still is the backup to Harden.
”When they call sub, I go‘ in,” he
said. ”They rotate me in every
third series.”

But sometimes the rotation
varies, and sometimes it's not
used. In the Broncos’ first playoff
game against New England,

nearly eight hours of interviews
in New York and went back to
Dallas, worried that he might
never get the call. ”Don’t worry,
you will,” Young told him and
he did — two years later, when
he replaced Red Miller as the
Broncos’ coach.

Parcells, meanwhile, was the
linebackers coach with the New
England Patriots and joined the
Giants as defensive coordinator
in 1981. When Perkins quit at the
end of the 1982 season to take
the head coaching job at Alaba-
ma, Parcells was promoted to
head coach. A

Meanwhile, Parcells and
Reeves have become friends who
chat on the phone about once a
week. Last spring, they agreed to
have their assistant coaches meet
in» Denver to discuss and share

Haynes saw his most extensive
action of the season.

”[Safety] Dennis Smith was

hurt, and that's the most I've
played this year,” he said. ”Last
week against Cleveland, I didn't
play at all. ' _
‘ ”... I'm not even the nickel
back; I'm the penny back. I'm still
trying todefine my role here. I
have no idea how much I'll play
in the Super Bowl.”

The former No. 1 draft choice
from the University of Colorado
said he won't let his uncertain sta-
tus ruin his first Super Bowl.

scouting reports on common op-
ponents from the AFC West ‘and
NFC East, a practice that some of
those opponents thought was a
bit too chummy.

’’It was just an exchange of in-
formation to facilitate both of our
schedules," Parcells says. ”We
hadn't played those ‘teams in
three years and we were un-
familiar with some of the players,
so we exchanged some informa-
tion on them. We didn't talk
about each other in any way,
shape or form.”

Broncoscelebrate at home

By John Mossman
AP Sports Writer

LOS ANGELES — The Broncos,
cheered on by 63,000 fans in an
old-fashioned pep rally at Mile
High Stadium, left snowy Denver
and arrived Monday in sunny
California, dreaming of a Super
Bowl victory.

‘The Broncos arrived at Long
Beach Airport, then departed im-
mediately for the Newporter Inn
in Newport Beach, their home
base for the week.

Coach Dan Reeves and Sever-
al players were to hold a news
conference at 6:30 p.m. PST.

The team will begin practicing
on Tuesday at Cal-Irvine.

Since Cal-Irvine has dropped its
football program, the Broncos
have set up a training facility,
complete with weight-training
equipment and whirlpools, at
their hotel.

The team will provide breakfast

and lunch, but the players will be i

on their own for dinner. Reeves
said no meetings or other team

activities have been planned for
evenings, but he will impose a
curfew.

Reeves said he hopes to keep
the Broncos on a time schedule
similar to the one they kept on a
normal work week in Denver.
The schedule will be disrupted,
however,- by 75-minute sessions
with the media each day from
10:30 to 11:45 a.m.

"When you're interrupted for
an hour and 15 minutes every
day, certainly there's going to be
some differences,” said Reeves.
”We’lI have to start a little earli-
er and finish a little later.

"We're going to be working
from breakfast at 7:30‘ in the
morning until the time we get off
the practice field at about 5 in the
afternoon — with the press deal
thrown in between there. We're
going to keep pretty busy.”

Reeves said the press inter-
views will interrupt his team's
morning meeting time, and said
the New York Giants probably
have a more favorable schedule.

The Giants’ Sessions’ with the
media are from 8:30 to 9:45 a.m.
each day.

"They (the Giants) had their
choice, because they're the home
team,” Reeves explained. "We
just won it the wrong year to get
our choice. Plus, league officials
said something about how they're
an East Coast team and they're
two hours different than we are.
I'm not going to make a big deal
out of it. We're going to have to
do the best we can with it."

On Sunday, 63,257 fansjammed
Mile High Stadium, cheering and
stomping their way through a Su-
per Bowl send-off rally for the
team.

"If you thought last week was
good, wait until next week,"
quarterback John Elway told the
cheering throng.

"You people never cease to
amaze me," said Reeves. "This
has been a fantastic year for us,
but we've got a job still before us
to do. We have a gift to bring
back to Denver."

Kay in key blocking role

COSTA MESA, Calif. — In the
view of many Super Bowl observ-
ers, the road to Pasadena narrows
at the feet of Denver Broncos
tight end Clarence Kay.

Kay will be blocking against
two of the most feared outside
linebackers in the game —
Lawrence Taylor and Carl Banks

of the New York Giants. If Kay

One thing positive has
emerged from the situation:
Haynes made Harden a better

estimation, has had an All-Pro

”This was good competition for
Harden," Collier said. ''I think

of them better."

Haynes said he might have ex-

"You have to realize I didn't

contract problems]," he said.
"This is a far more complex
