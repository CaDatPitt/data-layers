James Conducts
Discussion Group

Country's Foreign Policies‘ Seen
To Favor Own Interests

Dr. Alfred P. James, professor of
history, led a discussion on the for-
eign policy of the United States ..at
the meeting of the students interna-
tional relations group held in Room
315, Alumni hall, Monday,

Dr. James divided the foreign policy
of the United States into ﬁve phases:
the adherence of the United States to
the rules and princip-les of interna-
tional law, its rule in regard to citi-
zenship and naturalization, the policy
of isolation, the liberalization of high-
ways of communication in foreign
countries, and the policy of recogni-

. tion of other countries.

"The United States has been stead-
ily in favor of the amelioration of in-
ternational law and has made such
law the basis of its foreign relations
and diplomacy. '

“Vile have favored the international-
ization of highways in other countries
because we have everything to gain
and nothing to lose. The United
States has no streams which could be
internationalized, a11d our economic
policy in this regard has become
strikingly mercantilistic.”

Commenting on our.p-olicy of recog-
nition he added: “Up until 1913 we
recognized any de facto government
which came into existence, This sit-
uation was changed when Vvilson re-
fused to recognize the Huerta govern-
ment in Mexico and continued in
force in regard to Russia. However,
we are again reverting to our policy
of immediate recognition.” s

it has set, and, according to Lieutenant
Tredennick and the individual musi--
cians, “the best is yet to'"come.” To
morrow"s exhibition, something prom-
ised to be entirely unusual, will re-
ﬂect the long hours of work and prac-
tice insisted on by the organization
For example, each man is represented
by a numbered checker iii a pattern
of the formation being planned. These
checkers are arranged and rearranged

ers in interpretation of the music.
Not at all a.wed by the superior
Yegalia, of the Kiltie band, and en-
couraged by the favorable reception
accorded them at the Navy game, the

that the ordinary uniform of the
ROTC can look better than any other

Freshmen Spring
First Real Dance
‘Break’ Of Year

Past dance "chairmen will be sur-
prised to learn this morning that there
really are “new and different” ideas
for the running of campus affairs.
And it seems to have taken a so-
called mere freshman to point the
way.

In Monday’s issue of The Pitt News,
the information was released that the
price of the Freshman dance, sched-
uled for Friday, December 7, would be
$2 per couple. This in itself, accord-
ing to campus dance-goers, was none
too startling.

But J, Ncff Vvells, Jr.-., C, chairman
of the affair, today disclosed that the
price of admission will actually come
to less than $1.50 per couple, for, he
says, “VVe’re serving breakfast at
Stau1‘fer’s on \Vood street to every
guest, and it's all covered by the
ticket price.” _

Wells pointed out that most dance
patrons usually drop into one of many
popular restaurants after affairs, and
declared that everyone will really be
saving money that night under the
new plan. It is the ﬁrst time a stunt
of this nature has been worked in
connection with a University affair.,

The entire restaurant has been re-
served, beginning at 1 o’clock.

Announcement was also made by
the committee that Ches Walters’ 14-
piece orchestra, which played for the
CPSF dance and sing Saturday night.
had been engaged for the first year
informal. _

Walters’ also played for the annual
fall and winter style show of The Pitt
News earlier in the month.

New Yell To Ring
In Stadium

Fans in the cheering section at
tomorrow’s game need not worry
too much over the two new cheers
adopted after the recent yell con-
test was decided, according to
Bill Brinker, cheerleading coach.

A microphone announcement
will be made by cheerleaders be-
fore the game begins on the tim-
lng and stress of the new yells.
One rehearsal should be sufficient
for the “P-l T-T Rah-Rah Yeah

Brinker said.

Colored crepe paper work will
be executed between ha-Ives.

Game To Be Last
For Many Stars

Team Of Seniors In Final

Thousands of turkeys will be grant-
ed a few hours’ stay of mastication
tomorrow while their masticators
gather in the stadium bowl to send
volumes of cheers bouncing back and
forth over the concrete walls for Pitt
or for Tech.
~ This is all brought about by the an-
nual Thanksgiving Day football bat-

, tle between two schools whose rivalry
‘has been going on approximately as

long as turkey has been associated
with stulilings. This year the undis-
puted possession of the city football
title will go to the winner.

Looking over the records of the two
clubs, it takes a _very. hearty pessimist
to see anything difficult for the Pan-
thers beginning at 2 o'clock toinorrow,
Records, however, are very unsatis-
factory indications of what may hap-
pen. That is why the Panthers have
been drilling very, very late up on the
practice ﬁeld this week.

Those Horrible Examples

For no matter how secure the Pitt
boys may feel, they can always re-
member the recent unpleasant expe-
rience of the Princeton Tigers in a
little scrap with-the Yale Bulldog.
Also, Indiana’s «last Saturday victory
over Purdue was~—as in the case of
the broken adding machine—somc-
thing upon which nobody was count-
ing.

Coach Howard Harpster has brought
his team up to the Pitt contest in a
very proper frame of mind. Rising to
quell the onrush of Duquesne’s Dukes
a week and a half ago, the Tartans ap-
peared to ﬁnd themselves after ﬂound-
ering a lot this season and are eager
for more of that same victory blood.

Coach Jock Sutherland hasn’t let
his boys forget that this will be a
tough old ball game, however. The
passing attack has come in for a thor-
ough brush up during recent practice
sessions and the wide-open attack

The faculty members include Rob-
ert ,D.Ayars. professor of accounting;
William Daufenbach, assistant to the
dean of men; Lieutenant-Colonel Ed-
ward J. Cullen, professor of military
science a.nd tactics; and Carl B. Cass,
assistant professor of English.

The students who were tapped
were the following: Marshall Baker,
BA.35, president of Cap and Gown,
ﬁrst lieutenant of Scabbard and Blade,
and manager of the track team; Rus-
sell Connolly, C35, managing editor of
the Panther, a.n_d a member of the un-
do-rgraduate Cap and Gown club;
Israel Goldberg, C36, associate editor
of The Pitt News, manager of men’s
debating, and a member of the Uni-
versity Assembly; Charles Ruch, C36,
associate editor of The Pitt News and
editor of the Panther; Ellis Tumpson,

and a member of the University As-
sembly; John Tibby, C35, editor of

sity Assembly; Leonard Marks, C35.

ternity sing team could beat the Delts
in a contest of vocalizing, although
members of 11 other Greek teams
stoutly maintained that their efforts
rated favorable comparison Saturday
night. ‘ '

Delta Tau Delta, as-. usual, went
home from the main ballroom of the
VVilliam Penn hotel that night with
a new and shining loving cup tucked
under the arm of Les Wilkins, Delt
president and chairman of the Council
of Presidents of Social Fraternities,
which sponsored the annual sing and
dance.

In a surprise move, Theta Chi an-
nexed the second prize cup.

More than 300 couples were present
at the affair. ,

No one really believed. that any fra-

which featured the victory over No-
braska may get another airing, es-
 pecially if the Tech line runs true to
advance notices.
Tartans Are Tough

At the end positions the Tartans
have Lib Lewis and Maurice Patt.
Lewis has won praise iromvtbe coach
of every opposing team this year for
his steady play. Patt is a converted-
quarterback who showed plenty in the

Pair Of Wires Foil Picture-Snatcher While Fraternity

and dance: The chandeliers glis-

and blue lights; the sweeping col-
here and there; bright-lettered

Greek banners along the balcony; Sagging cariiations, crushed
against shoulders; swaying couples, bumping, gliding, running, hop-

ping, pressing warm cheeks; a few

misguided individuals in tuxedos;

sweet smiles, lightning glances from soft brown eyes; love in bloom.

«And hanging on the balcony above:

the orchestra's heads was a card-
board ﬁgure of the Cathedral. True,
because of the angle at which it hung,
it sometimes brought to mind a pile
of boxes, but everyone recognized it

, as a Cathedral,

In a'_thick press of dancers im-
mediately before
the orchestra, a
brother lea ned
over and Spoke
to a pledge.
“You're responsi-
ble for the Ca-
thedral up there,”
he whispered,
“Post one of the
other boys and
make sure no one
gets it.” A swir-
ling pair swept
the brother away,
leaving the
pledge to prance
worriedly along
with the gay swirling crowd.

Between the next two dances, he
and his partner went to the balcony
and peered down upon the orchestra,
covertly glancing at the fasteiiings of
“the Cathedral.” There » were only
two wires visible, with simple twists-
that would come apart with a jerk.
The young couple walked around the
balcony, looking for a place to hide
the ﬁgure if he could get it. The
music started; they returned to the
dance ﬂoor.

At the end of the number three
couples stopped to look down on the
orchestra. From the floor beneath,
they seemed merely to look; really,
they were grouped. The pledge mut-
tered, “responsible, eh?” stooped and
yanked the two wires loose. The Ca-
thedral started to sway, and the
dancers below s-aw it. The pledge
grabbed and lifted it over the bal-
ustrade, He jerked, but it didn't come
free. He drew his breath rapidly_

“Here, hold this a minute," he
whispered, and his partner balanced it

while he felt for the other wires. He
found three of them. The ﬁrst one
he pulled loose, but the second
wouldn't come. He took out his car
keys, hooked them over the wire and
jerked. The wire came, but at the
same time..the keys fell apart, and
he had to scoop them together.

i Interest was gathering in the group
,on the balcony. Another couple
‘strolled around. The pledge, looking
up, recognized with relief that it was
another pledge. “If it wasn’t for these
bottom wires, now,” he muttered,
"‘we’d have had it safe away.” He
felt around for the third bottom wire.
As he found it, his hand jerked back.
“Ouch,” he exclaimed ,and looking up
with some despair, groaiied, “The
wire’s hot!”

He couldii’t touch the wire, but it
was the last one to hold the figure
down. If he let the Cathedral go, it
would hang in the air. The pledge
looked at his partner, and she real-
ized the predicament.

“Hey, what are you doing?” a voice
growled in his ear. “You can’t steal
that. Leave it alone.”

“It won’t stay up," the boy replied
in a innocent neutral tone.

“No? Let me see?” the voice mut-
tered, and someone took hold of the
ﬁgure. The pledge pressed a wire in-
to the other boy’s hand, grabbed his
partner's arm, nodded to the other
couples, and they all melted into the
darkness, “Hey there,” the voice
called after them_ “Hey there . .”

When the couples got back down to
the ﬂoor, they mixed with the dancers
and looking up, saw that the angle at
which the Cathedral leaned from the
balcony had lessened considerably.
“Say, the thing looks a lot better,
now,” someone remarked, “I wonder
who was playing a.round with it.” Few
people, other than those of the bal-
cony know, for the pledge had been
immediately behind the ﬁgure, his face-
shielded from the light.

able placid entertainment, it is the

‘presentation of the character of
‘George Washington. Viewed in the
light of that purpose, the play falls
far short of success. It attempts to
show the difficiilties which beset
Washington,'and his strength of char-
acter in meeting them. But the diffi-
culties are not presented in a way to
persuade belief in them, They are
heaped on. Any difficulty that can
be found is stuck in. There are
deserters in the army and there is no
food for the men who don’t desert;
there is treason in the contiiietal con-
gress, and there is treason among the

commissioned officers; there is
disloyalty in minor degree every-

Washington had
difficulties to face
no one will deny.
That they came

to believe.

As I watched

interested in romantic idealism
change to light. “Valley Forge”

Washington is being beset by diffi-
culties,” or “General Washington is
now having an Emotional Crisis."
The effect of the presentation of these
difficulties and crises is an effect of
exaggc-ration and sentimentality.
Washington is not a man; he is a
ﬁgure manipulated in such a way as
to soar over a series of arbitrary hur-
dles_
After the crisis brought about by
these difficulties is reached, it is es-
sential that a little dramatic suspense
be achieved. Therefore, Vllasliington
weakens; very happily, however, a
pleasant series of coincidental deaths
helps him to regain his former con-
ﬁdence. May every noble cause be
blessed with such fortuitous events in
critical moments Furthermore, a
woman is introduced —- rather is
dragged—into the play. She has- no
real reason for existence. She is not
an organic part of the plot; as she
moves about the stage she is little
more than a movable piece of beauti-
ful scenery.
Sentimental Trend
F THIS CRITICISM be true, say
you, why bother discussing the play
further? “Valley Forge,” I must
answer, -is a play representative of
the new and growing idealistic, though
basically sentimentally romantic,
trend in literature. If we understand
‘the appeal of “Valley Forge,” we un-
derstand something of this new trend.
In Anderson's play everything hap-
pens just as our sentimental expecta-
tions desire. There is just the right
amount of suspense to allow the audi-
ence to be rooting for VVashington to
crash through, and to have the same
feeling of pleasant tenseness which
we all experience when watching per-
forming acrc-bats. ‘Yet all the time
the play in its mechanical nature be-

succeed, Again, the slightly
hesitates and is all but resolved on
surrender is relieved by the crowning
glory of Washington, strong in his de-
cisions amid. the tragedy of Death.
(Capitalization intentional) It is im-
portant to note that all through the
play there is always the assurance,
implied not only by historical fact
but by the play itself that the conclu-
sion will be happy. Even the minor
characters gratify our sentiniental
hopes—~for instance, one oflicer, who
alive has damned the cause, bursts
mortally wounded onto the stage and
sends King George to the devil.
That is, a person at a performance
of “Valley Forge” can sit comfortably;
he can allow his emotions to be
moved slightly without any fear of
meeting anything charged with suf-
ﬁcient importance to cause a deep
reaction. Few at the Nixon last week
felt that anything vital was going on
on the stage. An idealized ﬁgure, not
a man,- was fulﬁlling their expecta-
tions. Neither Washington nor the
revolution deserve such treatment.
No Feeling
HE SCENES IN THE bunk housel
are the best, but here again there
is no feeling for the troubles of the
soldiers. There is only enjoyment of
the soldiers’ jokes, of their ragged
and uiiclothed bodies, of their forays,
and even of their physical discomforts
and actual suffering, with perhaps a
touch of suspense when the soldiers
tie up their officers. A common com-
ment last week was “How very much
like soldiers these men are.”

or the costumes. They were excellent,    ,3 .t

with enjoyment of humorous situa-
tions and calm sentimentality, consti-

“How well Merivale acts,” or “How
funny is the man in the red breeches,”
or “They swear like real men,” or
“Weren’t the music and the dance in
the second scene lovely?” or “Wasn't
the bunkhouse set just what you
would expect to see in Valley Forge?”

"Nor have I attempted to criticize the
play in relation to its historical set-
ting, although there are parts which
seem at best to magnify certain situ-
ations. And in the play Washington,
of course, is not a part of the revolu-
tion but a dominator of it..

This can be said, however; that not
until Anderson realizes the effect of
the social situation of the present day
upon the present day American will
he create real characters of any time.
Anderson will never be able to analyze
the real George Washington until he
caii‘“analyz_e real people today; all his
historicafwork needs real people as
its basis.

And if he refuses to think about
certain very dominant traits in the
niake-up of people today, he will have
no idea of human beings. On the
other hand, if Anderson should think
about those traits, perhaps he would
not write historical dramas. And that
would be a great pity; for however
much I dislike and always, I believe,
will dislike “Valley Forge,” I spent an
enjoyable sentimental three hours last

a downtown paper Monday, but the

readers looking for de-
tails.

“Report shows state school utilities
link,” “Educational courses fostered
by light and power industry,” “Pitt,
Carnegie listed,” were the headlines
over a column-long story detailing a
Federal Trade Commissioii’s report on
propaganda work among schools and
educators by private utility companies.

The only reference to the Univer-
sity, or to Carnegie Tech, aside from

the headline, however, was made in
the last paragraph where the schools
were listed as among numerous insti-
tutions where propaganda lectures
were given to inﬂuence students.

The Chancellor's office and three
professors yesterday united in~laiigh-
ing down the idea of utilities inﬂuenc-
iiig faculty and students through bul-
letins, lectures and in the purchase of
textbooks.

“We have never heard of any such

spectacular

efforts,” the Chancellor’s oﬂice re-
ported, “The whole idea is ridicu-
lous.”

the Chaiicellor’s office asserted that

 

used and Lisually the professor teach-
ing the course made ﬁnal choice.

“In my four years at the Univer-

subsealient story was disappointing toisity, no utility has ever approached

me on the subject,” declared Dr.
George K_ Mccabe, assistant professor
of economics and public utilities
authority, “ln fact, with the publica.
tion in 1930 of Power and Propaganda,
a revelation of public utility propa-
ganda by Ernest Grueniiig, editor of
the Portland Evening News, utilities
here seemed to have abandoned all
efforts in that connection."

Dr. McCabe explained that the Na-
tional Electric Light Association, pub-
licity organization for gas and light
utilities, went as far as to change its
name to Edison Institute.

“We do have a utilities speaker here
once or twice a year,” Dr. MicCabe ad-
mitted, “but none of the utilities has
ever attempted to inﬂuence our pur-
chase of books.”

Montfort Jones, acting dean of the
School of Business Administration,
after decrying the matter, took a dif-
ferent point of view. He said:

“But what about these speakers?
If it is permissible to bring radicals
advocating public ownership here,
why shouldn’t it be permissible to
have a utilities speaker who is, after
all, better informed?”

Dr. Francis D, Tyson, professor of
economics, called the charge “old

Pitt, Tech Conclude Seasons

In Battle For City Crown

Harpsteris Team Eager
To Spring Surprise
On Panthers

(Continued From Page One)
oway are the big boys who take care
of things around the tackle positions.
Dutch, although he has been known
to run 100 yards in little more than 10
seconds {lat at the sight of a snake, is
just about immovable at his left tackle
post. Inasmuch as the Pitt backs
won't be likely to pack any snakes to-
morrow they may ﬁnd the Dutchman
pretty tough, Doloway is another big
fellow who does his business in a
steady way.

Henrion and Kelley are the likely
starters at guards. Henrion played a
sensational game against the ,-Dukes
and was about’ the best linesman on
the ﬁeld that‘ ‘day. Kelley is getting
in his ﬁrst licks on the varsity and
handles his post well. Between these
two plays Steve Trbovich, a crack
center. Just how these three will fare
against the Hartwig, -Shotwell, Ormis-
ton combine will make an interesting
affair to watch. If they succeed in heat-
ing back the latter trio they will do
something that hasn't been done yet
this year.

Among the Backs

Joe Mihm at quarterback and Steve
Terebus at left half are the Tech back-
ﬁeld aces. Mihm is as big as Terebus
is tiny, but both have the idea that
they ca.n carry that ball places, do
some classy interfering, and crack

who come into their vicinity.
For the remainder of his backﬁeld

Harpster may call upon Bill Spisak-,_.

Carlson, Lehman. or Vorderburg. All
of these fellows have done quite a bit
of ball-carrying for the Plaid and any
two of them form effectual running
mates for Mihm and Terebus.
Panthers I-lave Senior Lineup

Jock Sutherland has evidently de-
cided to make his Thanksgiving a
wholly bad day. Although Jock stands
to lose nine of his eleven ﬁrst-string
men by graduation, he is putting a full
team of seniors in the starting lineup
against Tech to make the wreckage
complete.

The shift entails sending Heinie
Yveisenbaugh into Bobby LaRue’s right
halfback position and putting Karl Sei-
fert at right end. This change will
hardly affect the Panthers’ power and
will certainly have a team playing this
last ball game as it ha.s never been
played before,

The remainder of the Pitt lineup
will be the same one that has started
the last three games. And when that
eleven comes off? the ﬁeld the cheers
should rend the stadium air as it has
never before been rent.

The game presents an odd angle in
that although Pitt is generally consid-
ered as the outstanding ball club of

the East it must battle hard tomor-'
row to win the championship of the 1;:
It just goes to prove that the 

city.
Panthers can't afford to take any
chances.

Varsity Meets Third Amateur
Team On Stadium Pavilion

 

Meeting its third district amateur
basketball team within the last week,
Dr. H. C. Carlson’s varsity ﬁve
played the Wilmerding YMCA team
last night at the stadium in another
pro-season tilt to smooth out the Pan-
ther’s game before the official colle-
giate season opens next week.

In the two previous games played
against the McKeesport Willigs and
the Duquesne Lafayettes, outstanding
local amateur ﬁves, the varsity was
anything but the usual smooth-work-

ing outﬁt that characterized Coach .-

Carlson’s teams in the past, Against
the Wilmerding ﬁve, however, the var-
sity ﬂashed a little more form, as a
whole, worked together more smooth-
ly. As usual, the game was played
without scores being kept.
Carlson believes that the team will
have plenty of games in which it will
only be too glad to have the baskets
added up.

The same lineup that has been to-
gether for the last several weeks
again started the practice game.
Skippy Hughes and Claire Cribbs at
the forwards, Pete Noon at center,
and Ted Roderick and Ross Emerick

at the guards composed the ﬁrst ﬁve.i 5.

The entire squad played sometime or
other during the evening. .
Practice will be held again this aft-
ernoon, with the squad then taking
advantage of the Thanksgiving holi-
day and resting for four days. It
marks the ﬁrst let-up- for the varsity
squad during the last month_ Return-
ing after the holidays the squad will

enter its last week of pre—s-eason prac-I 5-
tice, the opening game being played  -‘
here with Bucknell, December 8. ;

Dr. Carlson is still receiving letters; If
from many distant points requesting} ,,
information in regard to his annualf 

basketball clinic that will be held the
same date as the initial game. Invita-
tions to the clinic will be sent out
the ﬁrst of next week by Dr, Carlson.

No Overtime!

Attention has been called by the Miners to
the fact that the 6-0 defeat they sustained
at the hands of the FERA gridders Friday
was erroneously reported in the Pitt News.

The Miners claim that although they were
on the short end of the 6-0 score, the game
was not ﬁnished. The pick and shovel boys
had possession of the ball on the FERA ﬁve-
yard line when the FERA boys decided they
had put in their 40 hours of work for the
month and left the ﬁeld.

At that, it must be considered that leaving
thelﬁeld when your opponents have the ball
with a ﬁrst down on your ﬁve-yard line isn't
a bad idea. '

Shotwell Named
On All-Adonis

Eieven

With football gradually casting an
all-American complex over the entire
sport world, Southern California,
hotbed of many “greats,” oifers a new
basis for selection. Directly, Elsa
Blow, Southern California feature
writer, selects her team from a femi-
nine press box. Her all-Adonis team
“requires more than ordinary ability
and perception.” Anyone, with a lit-
tle industry and perseverance, can
pick out an all-American team of the
usual sort, she maintains.

So many vital things must be con-
sidered in her “Greek Gods” eleven-
hair, eyes, proﬁle, height, and that
elusive charm known as personality
Pitt’s own George Shotwell rated
the center position. Miss Blow chose_
him “entirely on the basis ofa dimple
in his chin and his very nice eyes.’.’
Bohn Hilliard, of Texas, was selected
because “he looked like he might have
a superior Texas drawl and a good
sense of humor——as well as an attrac-
tive smile.”

Don Jackson of Harvard holds down
the fullback position because he is six
foot three, has curly hair and a deter-.
mined expression, Jack Brittingham
was chosen to represent California at
right end because it is logical to con-
clude that every team has at least one
good looking man, -
Because he has that certain some-
thing and West Point has something]
Norm Edwards holds down left end,
Bill Spaulding, Jr., of UCLA is “just
plain cute at half and then, too, con‘-
sider the school he represents.” Buck
Dellen of Stanford at the other half‘

soniﬁes the gentlemanly charm and
breeding of the Stanford man.. ‘
Chris Kjeldsen, of the College of
the Paciﬁc, “simply radiates Nor-
wegian cha.rm at left guard.” .Miss
Blow chose David Chamberlain’ of
Princeton for the other guard because
he has a big, outdoorsy look’ and she
“couldn’t resist him when we learned
that his home town is Great Neck and
his prep school Hotchkiss.”

Jim Tatum’s smooth, suave, “man-
of-the-world” appearance rated him‘
left tackle, satisfying North Carolina
rooters. End Jed Ostling of Southern
California was chosen right tackle be-
cause he was once a tackle, -and any-

Kirkpatrick Wins
Individual Title
In District Meet

VPanther Seniors Capture First

Honors In Senior AMA Run;
Soph-Juniors, Second

Climaxing three years of brilliant
achievement with the cross-country
team, Charley Kirkpatrick led the
senior harriers to a team champion-
ship in the senior AMA meet last Sat-
urday afternoon at Schenley Park. In
leading the ﬁeld across the ﬁnish line,
“Kirk” came within 12 seconds of
breaking the course record for the ﬁve
and one-half mile course, completing
the long run in 27 minutes, 44 seconds.

Following Kirkpatrick closely, Sam
Musico, captain of the soph-junior out-
ﬁt, crossed the line in second posi-
tion, nosing out last year’s champion,
Kenny Wagenhouser, who captured
third place. Frank Giolma, the lone
entry for Carnegie Tech’s varsity,
ﬁnished fourth. _

The senior team won the team title
with 32 points placing men in 1st, 3rd,
5th, 9th, and 17th positions. Musico’s
sophomore-junior clan annexed second
honors with 41 points and the fresh-
man “A” team, led by Franklyn
Theriaut, won third place, scoring 48
markers.

By taking the individual title Kirk-
patrick joined his two teammates,
Albright and Wagenhouser, as win-
ners of the Senior AMA title. Albright
held the toga in his sophomore year
and Vvagenhouser garnered it last
year,

Thirty runners started the meet.

Phi Delta Theta continued to behave
like the class of the Interfraternity
touch football tourney Saturday when
it advanced to the semi-ﬁnals at the
expense of a plucky Phi Kappa team.
Four teams now remain to ﬁght it
out for the ultima.te championship.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon encounters the
favorite, Phi Delta Theta, in the up-
per bracket. Down in the lower
group, Pi Kappa Alpha and Delta "Tau
Delta should battle on fairly even
terms,

In the Phi Delt win, Grosscope’s ac-
curate passing clicked twice for
scores. The ﬁrst came in the second
quarter on a, long heave to Taylor.
Twice a strong Phi Kappa line tight-
ened upin the shadow of its own goal
posts. Then Grosscope hit the bulls-
eye again, this time with Saxman do-
ing the receiving. '

First downs stood at 4-2, Phi Delta

Coed Enrollment
In Law School
Shows Increase

Freshman Registration Takes
900% Jump Over Last Year;
Eleven Taking Classes

By Eleanor E. Knight

“VVomen have a deﬁnite place in
the legal profession and are now as-
suming that place.”

Eleven women, believing this, are
now enrolled in the School of Law;
making the largest enrollment of
women in the history of the school.
Nine of these are freshmen, an in-
crease of 900 per cent over last
year’s registration. ‘

Mrs. Marie G. Lindsay, registrar,
says, “The large number of women in
this year's class is possibly due to
the rising interest in law as a pro-
fession for women and also to the
business conditions."

The 11 women are Mary Lou Bar-
ron, a senior, Yetta Levenson, a
junior, and Genevieve Blatt, Marjorie
Hanson, Mary Jo Lippert, Mary Mad-
den, Rose Schorr, Jennie Ritchie,
Violet Scolio, Jane Humes and Jeneva
Paris, all freshmen_

Miss Barron, C31, will be the 26th
woman to graduate from the School
of Law, according to Mrs, L-indsay.

“Women have a deﬁnite place in
the courtroom,” says Miss Hanson,
C34, “perhaps even more so than men.
Since logic is the characteristic of the
man, let him prepare the brief and
let the woman, through her person-
ality, charm and ability, present the
argument, This is particularly true
of criminal law.”

' A woman law student interested in
politics is Miss Blatt, C33, assistant
women’s debating coach. In August
she received her Master's degree in
political science. While a graduate
student, she was co-chairman of the
Intercollegiate Constitutional conven-
tion. This fall, Miss Blatt spoke at
pre-election rallies throughout the
county as a member of the Democratic
County Speakers’ committee.

Both Miss Humes, a graduate of
Wellesley, and Miss Lippert, a.gradu-
ate of Seton Hill, are daughters of
Pittsburgh attorneys.

All say that studying law is hard
work, but Miss Madden, C34, saysthat
it is a lot of fun. Though her father
is a professor of law at the school,
the main reason she decided to be-
com.e a lawyer is that she feels there
is more opportunity in this ﬁeld than
in teaching or like occupations

These 11 women believe that the
time of women- barristers is near at
hand and are following the boy scout
Ideal of “Preparedness.”

Puritans’ Mode
Of Ceiebratin’

G o n e Forever

 

By Sarah Harris

Ninety-nine and forty-four one-
hundredths per cent Puritans can’t be
wrong, so there must be something to
Thanksgiving after all. But what a
difference there is between the old-
fashioned and modern celebrations!

The mention of Thanksgiving used
to C0I1J'11I‘0 up a picture of turkeys,
cranberry sauce, mince pies, and all
their deadly accoutrements_ John
Alden and his contemporaries used to
bag the turkey wild; today, supposing
there is turkey, the fowl is raffled off
at a market and dished up blue from
cold storage. The one sure method
of having a turkey dinner is to be-
come president and receive hundreds
of complimentary “boids.”

O u r great-great-great—great-grand-
mothers sat at home hoping for a
buggy ride at most; today Betty Coed
collects Joe College in her roadster
and they give thanks at some night-
club,

-VVho said the old order doesn’t
change? Even the conservatives sit
at home today and give no thought to
the holiday, or if they do give a
thought, it’s not a prolonged one.
Possibly it’s about the stock market
rising a point or two.

Certainly few go to church, as the
old guard did. The custom now is to
sleep until time for the game and then
prepare for the big feed. After the

gfame, bridge, dancing and other di-

vertisements are in’ order. ,
-“Sidney Shore has ﬁnally shown his
worth by coming to the front with
some Gertie Stein verses apropos:

There is a big egg, no egg a chick,
Chick eats days and days and days,
Axe comes down on turkey’s head
Let’s give thanks and praise.

Turkey in the barnyard, alas;
Turkey, barnyard in the grass;
Turkey, not a Turk, an American;
‘l_§'urkey’s gone, alas, alas, alas.

Mrs. Story To Speak

 Mrs. Chester B. Story will speak at
Heinz House next Monday at 2:30
o’clock on: “Style—a current event.”
Her lecture‘ is being sponsored by the
WCEL committee of WSGA, with
Nona Monks, Ed36, and Ruth Shapiro,
(337_ as co-chairmen. Other members
of the committee are: Alice Barch-
lield, BA36; Mae Banker, Ed35:
