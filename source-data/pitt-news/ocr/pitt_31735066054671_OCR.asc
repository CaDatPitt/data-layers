Pitt-Johnstown president faces
gender, sexual discrimination suit

Mike Faher

The Advocate '

J OHNSTOWN,Pa.—The
University has not responded
to a gender— and sex—discrimi—
nation suit filed in federal
court against Pitt-Johnstown
and its president, Albert L.
Etheridge.

Clea Patrick Hollis, UPJ’s
director of affirmative action,
filed the three—count com-
plaint in U.S. District Court in
July.

The complaint claims that

Etheridge, since he took the H

president’s office in 1994, has
tried to “deprive Plaintiff

(Hollis) of her constitutional
rights, belittle her, demean
her, and drive her from her
employment” because she
was black and a woman.

The complaint alleges
that Etheridge told Hollis that
“he did not believe in affirma-
tive action and that he would
do everything possible to
avoid implementing its princi-
ples.”

Hollis is seeking both
compensatory and punitive
damages. Her trial lawyer,
Robert Cohen, would not say
how much money Hollis is
asking for.

Cohen said the University
still has time to respond to the
charges.

“They’re not too late,’’
Cohen said. “They have 60
days.” ‘

Both Etheridge and his
lawyer declined to comment
on the complaint.

Pitt spokesman Ken
Service issued a statement
that denied all charges of dis-
crimination.

“The University believes
that Ms. Hollis has always
been treated fairly,” the state-

Wearing a hint of make-
up, a blue tank top and jean
shorts, Alyssa Lyons

dressed up just enough to’

make a good impression.
But with the absence of
Greek letters on her cloth-

ing, Lyons stood apart from
the sorority sisters at the
Greek fall‘ bash picnic on
Saturday. -
-Lyons huddled close to

her friend, Misty Greenlee,

as the two sophomores were

. guided around the Cathedral

lawn by a rush counselor —
a sorority member who dis-

affiliates herself from any
sorority tohelp all sororities-

As a freshman, Pitt
seemed foreboding to Lyons

Connecticut town. She wor-

Lyons said. _ , S‘ _~ -

For sororities, the second annual
fall bash is an essential part of getting
to know the Greeks. Lyons is one of
400 women interested” in rushing a
sorority — an all-time high for soror-
ities in four years. _

“I’m extremely excited that there
are so many girls interested in rush.
We’ve tried to show. freshmen that
it’s a positive thing being Greek,”
said Melissa Chordock, president of
Pitt’s Panhellenic Association.

The increased participation in

rush, the process through which inter— -0

every sorority, as was previously

required,
Pitt, which won awards for most
outstanding campus Panhellenic

Association in the Northeast, has
been successful in implementing the
new rush guidelines, said Shafer.
Anyone can rush, but Pitt-’s
Panhellenic Association requires
each woman to have minimum QPA

' of 2.0. From there, individual sorori-

ties can set higher QPAs as they see
fit. The average QPA of sororities is
actually higher than the overall QPA
for women‘ on Pitt’s campus.

Lyons and Greenlee don’t have a
particular sorority in mind. They said
everyone has been friendly to them.

“We’ll see what bids we get, but
first we are just trying to meet them
all,” Lyonfs said. 6

After a girl rushes a sorority, she“
may be given a bid, which is aninvi-'

tation to join a particular house. If the»

girl accepts the bid, she becomes a
pledge. Pledges must learn the histo-
ry and principles of their sorority.
The average pledge period runs about
six to eight weeks.

After initiation, pledges are con~
sidered sisters and can fully engage
in events such as mixers, date parties
and formals. Sisters can also hold
official positions within the house
and in the Panhellenic Association.

Sororities do a wide range of vol-
unteer activities and raise thousands
of dollars each year for a particular
charity during Greek week. 0

Lyons said she doesn’t see any
negative aspects related to joining the
Greek system. She isn’t concerned

“We know students want to
dump remaining blocks on
Sundays,” said Sallade-Farina.
“We’re more prepared this year.”

She said larger quantities of
products will be available and more
employees will be working during
problematic times. i i

As for prices, Sallade-Farina
said Food Services makes sure
Sodexho keeps most prices within 5

percent of street pricing. However, ’

she said Wholey’s decided to offer
higher-quality. products, such as
gourmet hamburgers. Unfortunately
for students, higher quality means
higher prices.

esis also part of the reason for the

higher prices, according to Sallade-
Farina. She said Wholey’s might
offer a, smaller portion at a lower
price.

Many students are also bothered
by the fact thatblocks cannot be
used in the Cathedral Cafe.

. According to Sallade-Farina, when

the area that Chick-Fil-A now occu-
pies was a Roy Rogers, students
could not use-their meal plans there.
When new catering firms were being
interviewed, she said, none but
Sodexho allowed the meal plan to be
used there. And even they would not
accept the entire meal plan.

. According to Sallade-Farina,
Sodexho and the other firms realized
that ‘faculty and staff ate at Roy
Rogers and that they spent a lot of
money there. Were they to allow the
students to use blocks, they would
gain customers yet make the same‘
amount of money, she said.

Because students have taken to

the Cathedral Cafe, the number of

non—student customers has fallen
off. Sallade-Farina said Food
Services may re-examine the
Cathedral situation, as well as the
new block system, should the

demand for change continue.

Sallade-Farina pointed to the
changes that have been made this
year, such as the expanded line of
Wholey’s food, the Frutazza drinks
in Eddie’s and the new, more meat-
like foods in C-Side’s vegetarian
line, explaining that these changes

‘came largely in part to student

action. _

“Students are very vocal,” she
said. '

Studentscan go_to food commit-
tee meetings in which they can voice
their opinions. Meeting times are
posted in food areas.

Senior Louis Gruver said he

voiced his concerns to‘ Sallade-
Farina in a letter, after finding
Schenley closed early before last
year’s spring break. Sallade-Farina

arranged for him to meet with cafe-
teria managers. '

“They listened to what I had to
say and said they would try to
change,” Gruver said. A

Sallade-Farina said she sees
many more changes in the future,
designed to keep students happy and
interested in the food at Pitt.

“I think it’s really important to
keep the meal plan, the facilities and
the concepts fresh,” she said.

.“Otherwise students get tired of

them.”

Meal plan should be simple
and convenient

Every year, Pitt’s food plan
continues down the path toward
culinary oblivion. This year, stu-
dents’ choices have been
trimmed becausethey are given
a fixed number of blocks per
week and are not able to carry
them‘ over into the next week.

The Department of -Food
Services should devise a plan
that is simple, convenient and
does not clamp so tightly on stu-
dents’ choices regarding what to
eat, when to eat and where to eat
it.

Food services should be
made convenient for the stu-
dents, not the food service con-
tractor. We understand the logis-
tics involved in anticipating the
amount of food that needs to be
prepared on any given day, as
well as the daily costs, such as
paying staff to prepare and keep
food warm and clean. But at
$4.65’ per block, students are not
receiving good value for their
money.

We understand why Food
Services is attempting to regu-
late the distribution of blocks.
Last semester, 15 percent of stu-
dents with meal plans ran out of
blocks the week before finals.

Another 15 percent had too

many. The block blitzkrieg at the
end of last semester probably

had some bearing in Food
Services’ decision to implement
the new plan. ,

Simplicity and convenience‘
would help. Statingprices, espe-
cially when specials are offered,
would help. Students often are
confused by what their blocks
will buy and don’t understand
what combination of items they
can purchase.

Food Services should also
post the times during which the
cafeterias are open. Many stu-
dents, especially freshmen, are
still confused and don’t know
when Eddie’s and Schenley Cafe
are open.

Our suggestion is to offer‘ a‘

meal plan that is convenient and
simple. Last year’s meal plan
was considered a bad one by
many, but it’s certainly better
than the new one. Food Services
needs to eradicate the quirks in
the present system (we have not
even discussed the intricate
workings of the Dining Dollars
system).

The students should not be

‘handcuffed. Restricting choices

for the sake of Sodexho’s and
Food Services’ convenience is
the not the way it should be.

The meal plans should be
made convenient for the people
using them.

Food good, ambience needs work  

Recently, I had the opportunity to work in
the Venango County jail kitchen. By “had the
opportrmity,” I mean, “was sentenced.”

But I am not writing about the “judicial
error”—asIliketocallit——thatdrainedmy
wallet and my energy. I am not writing about my
anger for “The Man” or ""Ihe System” — two
termsthatarehighlyoverusedandalsoarehigh
on my bell curve of hate. I am writing about 20
hours in the belly of the beast, my weekend in
Hell. .

Early one warm Saturday morning, 1
showed up at the back door of the prison, sup-
pressing my urge to-smile into the security cam-
era. To spare you the honor of the next few min-
utes, I will just say they involved several button-
pushings, a few buzzes and someone patting me
down. (Wait, maybe I’m getting my weekends
confused.)

The guard escorted me to the kitchen. By
“escorted,” I do not mean I looped my arm
around his and made a grandventrance. It was
more of a “Walk this way.”

Some people would not call C H R | 5 _ I sat and wondered about the
working in the jail Hell. The Greeks inmates. I hadn’t actually seen any,
might call it Hades. Some‘ people so I thought about what the rest of
actnallycallit a job. _ GRISWOLD the jail was like. Unfortrmately,

The guard introduced me to the ' everything I knew about jail I -

people who work there every day. The only dif-
ference between us was that the paper forcing
them to work there has a picture of a president on
it Also, they were cheerful. I named them the
Lost Ones. In a sort of tribal ritual, one of the
ladies greeted me and showed me the ways of
the kitchen. They involved a lot of rinsing and
stacking of plastic trays.

The woman gave me latex gloves and a

‘ haimet (I left mine at home) and led me to the
stainless steel dishwasher. She asked me how_

long I would be there that day.

“Ten hours,” I told her.

“Great!” she exclaimed happily. 4 V —

I was astonished as to how different our
views of my situation were.

I began washing the trays, spraying them

wiﬂr a water cannon possibly donated by the ﬁre ’‘

department, and placing them in racks to slide
through the washer. The steel monster would
rumble, chum and spew steam and food parti-
cles. The trays usually came out still caked with
partially eaten lasagna chunks. But they were
beautifully clean lasagna chunks.

I tried to be hygienic, but after rinsing some

_ of the trays three times, my human compassion
’ was waning. I remember my moral dilemma as

  

I looked ﬁom a stack of sparkling clean trays to
theshelves where I would have to stack them,
and then . to my cake-encrusted gloves.
Meanwhile, trays poured forth from ﬂie washer
like the brooms in “Fantasia.” As the trays threat-
ened to wedge me against the wall, backing up
ﬂre system andbringing unwanted attention, I
hurriedly tried to devise a plan to transport the
trays to the shelves.

This did not involve washing my hands. I.

think I learned something then: Self-preservation
is a very strong instinct. My course of action
changed when I learned I would be eating there,
from the same trays — very strong instinct,

— indeed I became a whirlwind, breaking down

the routine into basic steps: rinse, wash, shelve. I
was proud of myself when they were done. Then
they brought in the next cart.

They fed me around these times. It was very
good, I must admit — just like high school cafe-
teria food, except it was in ajail. I can imagine an
inmate saying, “I went to jail for tax evasion, but
I stayed for the roast bee .”

learned from movies and television. I tried to
ignore images like the jail scenes from “Silence
of the Lambs” and focus on something happier,
more serene. I settled on a pet shop. ,

Maybe on one cell’s sawdust ﬂoor, an
inmate played with a ball of yarn, while in the
next cell, a group of inmates curled up together

under a heating lamp, wide-mouthed yawns, ,

brightening their cute little faces.

As I washed their trays, I would give the
faceless inmates personalities based on their eat-
ing habits. “Bill” left pretty designs in his pud-
dingandmashedpotatoes;hewasanartistaI
heart. I would worry about “Clem.” Sometimes

_ he didn’t eat much.

The strange ideas ended the moment my
steam-scalded hands untied my damp apron
strings. ~
On behalf of my mother, I would like to
make the statement thatl am not abad person. In
a small town like Franklin, standing on a bridge
can be mistaken‘ for hoaxing a suicide. And
sometimes, the only difference between guilty
and not guilty is a $100 cornt hearing.

Cannibalism

Gerald Bergen
Columnist

“And I believe, no Gentleman would repine
to give Ten Shillings for the Carcase of a
good fat child; which, as I have said, will
make four Dishes of excellent nutritive
Meat, when he hath only some particular
Friend, or his own Family, to dine with him.”
(Jonathan  Modest Proposal)

   

But we somehow seem to “enjoy” can-
nibals, albeit in a socially acceptable way.
Movies that feature cannibalism, such as
“The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” and“‘The
Silence of the Lambs” (which starred
Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal “The
Cannibal” Lecter) were box oﬂice smashes

Vampirisrn, as romanticized by Gary
Oldrnan and Brad Pitt in their respective hits,
“Bram Stoker’s Dracula” and “Interview
with the Vampire,” involves a somewhat
limited cannibalistic exchange of body ﬂu-

individuals waiting for Goth Night at The

‘ _ Attic, and you’ll see some sour looks.

There have been carmibalistic themes in
popular music as well: “I Eat Cannibals” by
Bow Wow Wow, “She’s a Man Eater” by
Genesis (?l) and “I” Only Want To Be VV1th
You” by Hootie and the Blowﬁsh.

(Note to "readers: Hootie and the
Blowﬁsh did not expressly mention canni-
balism, but I did gnaw off my hand while lis-
tening to the song). ‘

Crush cannibalistic capitalism

Adrian Kimble

Columnlst

In a world where capitalism is God
and the worker is merely an asset upon
which corporations prey, , the next
inevitable step in human evolution is
cannibalism. Comrades, this consump-
tion of the proletariat’s ﬂesh will not
happen if we stand up to the global _.
of the market system. _

We all know that the Europeans were
the ones who “cannibalized” the African
continent. ' ‘ ,
Cannibalism and capitalism are one
and the same thing. Both show a total
disregard for the disenfranchised work-
er. One devours your ﬂesh, and the other
devours your soul. A cannibalistic spirit
is prevalent in the American workplace
“dog eat dog,” if you will.
Collectivization of the human. spirit is
replaced by the enslavement of it. The

I worker is caught in thecogs of the cor-

to take. What’s the
bright side of this
argument?

I believe that
along with herd
control, therewould
be side beneﬁts and
gains that come
from _ eating
humans. For ,
instance: ,

- PETA would
ﬁnally stop harping .
about mistreating ’
animals. However,
they would proba-

Gerald Bergen has never eaten ‘human

they taste like chicken '

porate machine, its fangs sucking every
ounce of blood, sweat, adrenaline and

Love of money and greed go hand-
in-hand with cannibalistic instincts.
Blood is spilled by the worker to feed
the corporate directors. VV1th this in
mind, the actual consumption of the
worker’s flesh is "inevitable. Power
lunches will take on a whole new mean-

. ing. It will be the way of cutting back in

the future. Why ﬁre workers when they
can make a nice, tasty snack? If proﬁts
and the bottom line continue to be soci-

‘ ety’s priorities, then the blood and sweat

of the worker will become his own

ENVY-_ .
Friends, comrades, we must stand

up to this nonsense. The workers united

will never be eaten. No longer will we
be trodden underfoot and placed on the
grill of capitalist discontent. No longer
will we be forced to go according to the
whims of some fat, greedy bourgeois
CEO in a New York ofﬁce. “

Cannibalism is inherent in bour-
geois nature. Look at the ﬁlm “Alive,”
(directed by Frank Marshall, who also
brought the Michael Crichton neo-colo-
nial fantasy “Congo,” which featured
ting '11 d L '

      

 

Herdarri,  erlin,

'Moscow and Bangkok, and you’ll see

bourgeois hypocrites eating caviar off
the breasts of strippers. As Joseph
Gielata pointed out in his June 10 Pitt
News column, “...all the licking and
sucking seem almost like vain attempts
to eat ﬂesh. In fact, it surprises me that
we so infrequently hear about incidents
of cannibalism, given the similarity of
the two appetites [food and sex].”

The snacking stops here. We must
rise up against our bourgeois oppressors
before they literally eat us alive.

A Solidarity, not being basted and stuffed

with a sauerkraut made from onions,
carrots and, red cabbage, is the key to

gaining rule for the working masses.

The bourgeois cannibalistic instincts (as
epitomized by the posh vampire played
by Tom Cruise in “Interview With the

. Vampire”) will be eradicated by a ﬁrm

ﬁght from the proletariat.

“No bull ! No slaveship! No
muthaf Hootie & the Blowﬁsh!”
shouts Soulﬂy’s Max Cavalera. “Up the
workers!,” shout I. We are a sea that will
rinse the sins of the bourgeoisie away
when the moon swings the working
classes into high tide. Anger, destruction
and -chaos will be our creed until the

‘fangs of the capitalist have been

removed and replaced by the dentures of
egalitarianism. Their greed will make
these false teeth ﬂap against their gums,

but the Sterodent and adhesive of Karl-
Engel’s ’
“Communist Manifesto” will quell any ‘

Marx ‘ and Friedrich
cannibalistic thoughts! '

I say unite! If we don’t, the workers
become a buffet table on which the cap-
italists feast. The St. Ides truck, which
has come to be the Wilkinsburg equiva-
lent of an ice cream truck, must be
vaporized. They will not fatten us on
chicken wings and malt liquor!

Under a gray sky we shall» arise!

Adrian Kimble would never eat a fellow

enough to invest in stocks in Las Vegas,

PS U, please
extend the
rivalry

There _are some great college
football rivalries.

UCLA vs. USC, Michigan vs.
Michigan State, Florida vs. Florida

State and, of course, Pitt vs. Penn

State. .

That’s right. Everyone knows
about Pitt and Penn State. They
started playing in 1893. There have
been times where there have been
lulls in the rivalry, but now is the
time when rivalries are big in college
football.

Rivalries help teams to get some
high home attendance numbers and
to bring excitement to the schools,
but Joe Paterno does not seem to feel
that way.

The Pitt vs. Penn State series is
only scheduled to last until the fall
of 2000. There are no plans to con-
tinue any farther than that.

Discontinuing the series would
be a travesty in college football,
especially in Western Pennsylvania.
The games between these two sto-
ried football programs have brought
some of the greatest memories for
each team. 9

Current . Penn State
Paterno is 21-6-1 in Pitt games, and
his Nittany Lions lead the all—time
series 48—4l—4. V

Penn State won’ the first game in
the series, 32-0, and the Nittany
Lions have outscored the Panthers

1,534 to 1,234.

Most games in this series have
been very" close and have left the
fans wanting more each year. If Penn
State beats Pitt, the Panther fans
can’t wait until next year to get
another shot. I

But could you imagine if there
wasn’t a next year? ,

Pitt fans have been talking about
Penn State’s return to Pitt Stadium
on Sept. 19 since the day the sched-
ule was released.

This rivalry has meant a lot to
the teams, as well. There was a time,
not that long ago, when Paterno
needed Pitt on his scheduleto make
it legitimate and draw some extra
fans. a ,

Sure, Pitt is not a national power
now, but it would not be a bad non-
conference game for Penn State to

For The Pltt News

Head football coach Walt Harris
praised coach Joe Paterno and the Penn
State football program at his press confer-
ence yesterday, warning that the Panthers
will need to overcome their own relative
youth in order to defeat the Nittany Lions.

“They have the kind of football pro-
gramthatisdeepenoughtoplaythree
groups of football players at every position,
which is an envy of ‘a coach in a football
program such as ours right now,” said

Hanis admitted to being “a worrier”
when it came to the Panthers’ inexperience,
especially in the backﬁeld There. will be
ﬁve rtmning backs on the depth chart
Saturday, featuring only one senior.

The coach also mentioned that the H 3

Lions have a physical advantage over Pitt,
claiming their linemen “look like they’re
bigger than the Steelers.”

The way to beat Penn State, Harris
said, is through hard work.

“What we can’t have happen is we

9 can’t be out-fought,” Harris said

He armounced that freshman Brandon
Wﬂliarns will once again start at nmning
back, praising him for his ability and work
habits. ’

tice, he really tries to do what you ask him
to do. As soon as he gets settled in with
what we’re doing, I think he’ll be a good,
solid football player,” Harris said
Wlliarns rushed for 50 yards in 11
attempts in the 48-41 victory over
Vrllanova two weeks ago. -
Harris complimented many individual

eﬂbrts ﬁom the Vrllanova game, including
those of wide receivers Kenney Ketchen
and LatefGrim. Grim leads the Big Eastin
receiving yards and has three touchdowns
after one game.

Regarding the Panther’s health, Harris
said, “We’re probably healthier than we
were two weeks ago.” A

The only exceptions might be senior

, wide—receiver Terry Murphy, who is day-

to—day with a right shoulder injury, and
Ketchen, who was non-contact yesterday
with -an elbow injury.

Theioff-week was very useful for the
Panthers, not only for recuperation.

“We needed the time,” Coach Harris .

said .“Hopefully, we’ve ironed out some
things that allow us to play a little more
competitive.”

Of the adjustments the team made dur-
ing the break, special" teams was the most
prominent. Hanis admitted to making some
personnel changes, saying, “Our lacking [in
leadership] showed in that last ballgame.”

Harris left no doubt as to his feelings
about the importance of the "Twelfth Man”
on Saturday.

“I would hope our students and our

. fans make it a real home—ﬁeld'advantage,

because obviously the home—ﬁeld advan-
tage was at play for them [last year]... That

of witnessing one of the most atrocious

It was one of those things that’s so

actually saddening because it’s a reﬂec-

Sickening. .

Grown adults have mature minds of
their own. A grown adult may decide to
partake in the evil ritual of Penn State
worship — that’s the adult’s preroga-
tive. I

But to thrust a perfectly innocent
child into that environment is awful

A child’s mind is impressionable,
and subjecting him to the sinful ways of
Penn State at such a young age could
scar him for life.

If we wrote down the names of chil-
dren donning Penn State garb, I don’t
think it would be a coincidence if we
saw the very same names in a newspa-
per’s police log 20 years from now-.

When I saw that adorable baby,

smiling and giggling, wearing a blue
and white “Little Nittany Lion” outﬁt,
my blood started to boil. Parents who

do that to their kids should be locked '

up.

But Penn State abuse is about more
than just clothing; it’s about subjecting
children to that kind of environment at
any level.

Let’s take a look into a family home
in State College, where a sweet three-

,-year-old girl spends a day with her
mom.

Morn brings the girl with her to the

mom and dad are awakened to the
sound of their daughter’s blood cur-

The parents run into the girl’s room
to ﬁnd her crying in horror because of a
nightmare she had.

“Mommy, Daddy, I had an awful
dream,” she whimpers. “That scary old
man from the poster in the grocery store
.— he was walking around my room in
dress pants and white socks. He looked
at me through those big glasses, and he
started whining about something called

Why do people wear PSU gear?

Melissa Baran
Staff Writer

Ahh  the Pitt blue and gold —

there’s nothing like it. Walking down a
Cathedral corridor while seeing fellow

students adorned in these wonderful col-A

ors in the form of T-shirts, jackets and
sweatshirts leaves one with a sense of
school pride.

However, that feeling of school spirit
becomes squashed when strolling across
Bigelow; no, the crossing masses didn’t
get hit by a Port Authority bus —— some-
one dodging the trafﬁc on the other side
of the street is wearing a Penn State
sweatshirt. '

What kind of statement does this ter-
rible fashion choice make?

Not only are these students choosing
to wear the clothing of another university,
but by wearing the colors of the very
school so hated, they became an integral
part of our ﬁght song even when they
aren’t in town for a game.

It is hard to understand this strange
phenomenon plaguing our campus more
and more in the past years.

“I wear my [Penn State] shorts
because they are comfortable workout
shorts. I don’t have a problem with it. It is

just another school,” sophomore Nikki

Cooper said.

Just another school? Granted, our
football programs have gone in different
directions over the years, but student or
no student, anyone living in this century

knows Penn State is not just any other
school, especially if he or she is an avid
Pitt fan.

“I own my PSU clothing because my
cousin bought it for me. I really don’t care
as long as I don’t wear it ‘to a Pitt func-
tion,” junior Carrie Buchanan said.

Freshman Dan Paley agrees with
Buchanan.

“I have the clothing. I just don’t wear
them all of the time on campus,” he said.

It is good that these students can
make the claim. But regardless of what
anyone does on campus, whether it it’s
attending a football game like the one on
Saturday or walking to Schenley Cafe, it
is a Pitt function.

Sophomore Mike Mattes, who does-
n’t wear a thread of the Penn State garb,
agrees with the idea that Pitt functions
occur every day.

“Wearing your rival’s school clothing
around campus —,that’s odd. You could
at least show a little school spirit,” he
said. I V

The moral of the story is, in order to
heighten our school spirit and keep alive

i a long standing rivalry, some of us must »

rethink the meaning of being a true Pitt
fan by dwindling our wardrobes to reﬂect
true allegiance to the Panther blue and
gold.

Melissa Baran is just another Pitt student
who wants to voice her opinion about
Penn State, but she ’d be committed if she
ranted like this on Bigelow Boulevard.

ule if not for any other reason than
for the sake of the fans.

L-‘Pitt Athletics Director Steve
Pederson said that if Penn State came
to him with a deal to expand the
rivalry for 30 years, he would “sign
it tomorrow.” -

Pederson understands the impor-
tance of this rivalry and its place in
the history of Pitt and Penn State
football.

Both schools have very good
football programs, although Pitt is
still in a rebuilding process. It would

not really harm either school to keep.

the rivalry going.

Penn State and Joe Paterno ran
away from a possible Eastern
seaboard superconference and ran to

the Big Ten. Now he is trying to take
the Big Ten television money and
run. A

This may be good for the Nittany
Lions now, but he must think about
the future and the past. This rivalry
has so much to offer to the fans and
to the schools. Giving it up would be
a disaster.

I open this issue to Joe Paterno
and Penn State .Athletics Director
Tim Curley. I ask that either of these
men pick up the phone and call Steve
Pederson to extend these games.

Patrick Robertson is the sports
editor of The Pitt News and would
like to see a Pitt vs. Penn State game
when he is as old as Joe Paterno, but
he hopes he will not still be clinging
to a job he should give up like the
