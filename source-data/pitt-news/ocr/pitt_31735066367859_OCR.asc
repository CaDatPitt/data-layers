Pitt Chancellor Wesley Posvar
has been selected to sit on a
National Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation (NCAA) committee that
will study the problems plaguing
intercollegiate sports, according to
an article in the Chronicle of
Higher Education.

The object of the committee is to
look for practical ways to alleviate
some of the problems and to relieve
pressures that are put on coaches
and players, the article said.

Pitt‘s new athletic director, Dr.
Edward Bozik, who formally re-
places Cas Myslinski as of Sep-
tember 1, said the formation of the
committee is a good idea and the
that Posvar plays is
important.

Schenley s

Renovations

Progressing

. The.renovations of P-itt’s student.

union are almost halfway com-
pleted, but the most difficult work
is just beginning. “

Director of student activities
Andy Smith said that renovations
of the main floors of ‘the student
union, to begin around Nov. 1, will
be more extensive and complicated
than the work done on the upper
floors.

The $13 million renovations of
Schenley Hall, which was once an
exclusive hotel, are expected to be
completed in the fall of 1983,
according to Smith. _

“We’re a little_ bit ahead of sche-
dule at this point," he said.

Floors three through seven of the
building, housing student organi-
zations and some administrators,
were gutted and rebuilt earlier this
year. Student groups have moved
back into new offices.

Work on the lobby will begin-
Nov. 1, Smith said.

Exterior renovations include the
formation of the university seal on
the Forbes avenue side of the build-
ing. This area will be known as
Forbes plaza, and will i have
benches and sidewalks.

"We’ll have this area_ basically
finished by October,” Smith said.

Smith said there have been
“minimal” changes in the renova-
tion plans. One major change was

.-the elimination of the tenth floor,

" which was determined to be unsafe.
In, addition, the upper floors are
painted with a certain type of paint
that is difficult to wash. Smith said
no. decision has been made yet
whether to repaint the walls. Sche-
dule changes for groups during the
renovation include:

0 On Nov. 1, the office ofstudent
activities and off-campus housing
will move to their permanent offi-
ces on the first floor. Those offices
are currently located in the Kurtz-
man Room on the main floor.

Vice chancellor for - student
affairs Conney Kimbo, whose
office is now on the seventh floor,
will also then move back to the first

“The University of Pittsburgh
has been reasonably successful in
maintaining good quality in both
its academic and athletic pro-
grams,” Bozik said. “It’s important
that Pitt takes a leadership role in
addressing these problems.”

The 16 member committee is
made up of, college presidents,
coaches, athletic directors and
faculty members and will meet four
times beginning in September, the
article said.

Bozik said many of the problems
in intercollegiate sports have been
“somewhat imagined but are none:
theless real.” He gave examples of
commercialism in sports and the
rates of varsity players who
graduate.

“Two percent of people who

play football in college go on to
professional leagues,” Bozik said.
"The average years of a profes-
sional player is 4.7. What do they
do with their life after?”

Bozik said it is a university pol-
icy not to admit a student unless he
has a reasonable chance to gradu-
ate. Students who participate in
varsity sports have a lot of demands
placed upon them in the forms of
studying and practicing.

An institution like Pitt that has
many students participating in
sports need support services to help
the student, Bozik said.

“The University of Pittsburgh
has a pretty good athletic support
system for athletes,” he said.

Bozik also cited the commercial-

ism of intercollegiate sports as

another problem to be dealt with.

“With the money needed to oper-
ate a sports program, the TV and
gate ‘revenue, we’re operating a
fairly substantial enterprise,”_
Bozik said.

John P. Schaefer, former presi-
dent of the University of Arizona
and executive director of the NCAA
committee, said one of the prob-
lems the committee might tackle is
coaches’ job security, according to
the article. s

“We let them know they’ve got to
win to retain ‘their jobs,” he said,

“but then tell them they’ve also got‘

to. play the game honestly.”
Bozik said he does not think
there has been unreasonable pres-
sure put on Pitt‘s coaches to win.

Student Government Board
President Todd DeLuca said it
will be a busy term with board
elections in early November,
and continued work on old and
new projects.

DeLuca said the election
code, which are the rules the
board candidates follow, was
finished in the summer.

He said elections would -be
two weeks earlier this year
allowing a formal transition‘
period for elected board
members. '

SG Plans Year

This transition period will
allow the former board
members to orient the elected
members with the constitution
and SGB policies. ‘

He said he also plans to pro-

' pose a change in bylaws mak-
ing the Commuter Affairs
Committee a governance group
instead of a standing
committee.

The board will work on a
change in the constitutional
bylaws concerning summer
office procedures, DeLuca said,
enabling the board members to
leave in the summer and report
to occasional meetings.

Concerning the effort to stop
the increase ‘in the student
health fee, DeLuca said the fee
increase has been implemented
as planned by the Student
Health Service.

DeLuca said SGB’s newly
renovated offices will provide a
more professional atmosphere
and better-board vs. committee
relationships.

“The new offices will not be
as much a social atmosphere,”
he said. ‘

He said the first SGB public
meeting is slated for Tuesday,
Sept. 7, and the first planning
session will be Sept. 12. O

There To
Do Around Here?  

Than You MightThink

BY DIANE LEFKOWITZ

There's more to Pittsburgh than
Pitt, and it’s not all factories and
rivers. The city’s got a number of
cultural events that even students
would be.interested in. So for some-
thing to do on a Sunday outing
when Mom and Pop come to visit,
here are a few suggestions.

V The best way to see the city is the
daily PAT bus tour, which runs
through Sept. 6. The 3-hour tour
leaves Carnegie Institute on Forbes
Avenue at 11:57 a.m. and includes

'_ the sights from Oakland to Pitts-

burgh’s North Side.

The entire tour, which includes
an incline ride to Mt. Washington,
is only $6. For information about
other PAT bus service, call 231-
5707. If you tell them where you are
and where you want to go, they’ll
tell you which buses will take you
there. A

While on the tour, you’ll get to
ride the Duquesne Incline. Provid-
ing one of the most unusual and
scenic views of the Point, the
incline runs from 5:30 a.m. to 12:45
a.m. during the week and from_ 7
a.m. to 12:45 a.m. on weekends and
holidays. The fare is 50¢‘each way.

Pittsburgh from the riversis an
unusual view. The Gateway
Clipper Fleet -offersseveral sight
seeing cruises throughout the year.
Included are 2 l/2-hour lock and
dam cruise for $4.50 per person, the
2-hour Twilight Fountain Cruise
for $3.50 and the 2-hour Three Riv-
ers Cruise for $4.50.»

The Triple Treat tour allows
sightseers to discover Pittsburgh by
riverboat, trolley and incline.

The Gateway Clipper Fleet also
offers special cruises, such as the
Under 21 Dance Cruise, which
boards at 6 p.m. and sails until 10
p.m. every Monday through
December for only $3.75 and the
Regatta of Bands Dance Cruise,

which sails every Friday through

Oct. 1 from 11 ‘p.m.--2 a.m. and
features well-known local bands
such as Corbin/Hanner and Billy
Price. Sandwiches and cocktails are
available. Twenty-one is the min-
imum age allowed on this cruise.
There will be two special daytime
cruises over Labor Day weekend,
and the cost is $5 or $6. _

All tours leave from the Station
Square dock on Pittsburgh South
Side. Before boarding one of the
tours or cruises, check out the
Freight House Shops at Station
Square. Quickly becoming one of
the city’s trendiest spots, the con-
verted railroad station houses 42
specialty shops and seven restau-
rants, ranging from the opulent
Grant Concourse to the Original
Station Street Hot Dogs to Houli-
-han’s, a popular nightspot.

The shops are open seven day-s a_
week, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Mon-
day through Saturday and from
noon to 5 p.m. on Sunday. Restau-
rant hours may vary.

One place to watch for some of
Pittsburgh’s biggest events is the.
Civic Arena. Located in Pitts-
burgh’s uptown section, the Arena
is the home of the Pittsburgh Spirit

$.‘.’.€.F‘?..F w2d...!he..1ii.¢.tsburs.!1.ﬁnguin.at  . 

hockey teams, as well as being the
site of most of the city’s major rock
concerts. With a capacity of 17,000,
the Civic Arena is noted for its
domed roof that slides open during
certain events.

Pittsburgh has been called the
“City of Champions" because ofits
successful sports teams. Both of
Pittsburgh’s world champion
teams, the Pirates and the Steelers,
play at Three Rivers Stadium.

Pirate home games run until
October 3. General admission is
$2 50 and box seats are $7. Unless

 
 

  

The Gateway Clipper Fleet (abo

you have season tickets, however,

getting to see the Steelers play is a
more difficult propositon.

In addition to the stadium, Pitts-
burgh’s North Side has even more
to offer. The Pittsburgh Aviary has
tropical and exotic birds in nearly
natural habitats and is open every
day except holidays from 9 a.m. to
4:30 p.m. There is a $1 admission
fee for adults except on Mondays
when admission is free.

Most‘of the coaches that have left-—
Johnny Majors in 1976 and jackie
Sherrill in l982—left voluntarily.

“Our objective is to have a win-
ning program, but winning isn't
everything,” he said.

Bozik said that in a competitive
situation like intercollegiate
athletics, it is necessary to have
continuity and stability in a sports
program. With the hiring of Foge
Fazio, a Pitt student who worked
his way up the ladder of the Pitt
football team coaching staff, Bozik
believes that Pitt is moving in the
direction of “winning continuity.”

Another policy of the university,
Bozik said, is for coaches and play-
ers to “win within the rules.”

The NCAA is currently looking
into a system where some sanctions
can be placed on coaches who vio-
late rules and then leave institution
to suffer the consequences. The
NCAA is also proposing other
sanctions to be imposed on athletes
who violate the rules, Bozik said.

Ground

Pre-season football polls, which areoften as
useful as wool sweaters in July, have Pitt ear-
marked to end up the nation's No. 1 team.

While that news is enough to make head-
lines, another. matter involving Pitt sports
should not go ignored.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar has been selected
to serve on a committee formed by the National
Collegiate Athletic Association that will study
the problems plaguing intercollegiate athletics.

The 16 member committee, made up of col-
lege presidents, athletic directors, faculty
members and coaches, will certainly have its
hands full.

The problems involved with promoting big-
time athletics while maintaining the integrity
of the university have been detailed before. The
conflict was further highlighted when the Uni-
versity of San Francisco, citing flagrant abuses
on the part of alumni and players, dropped its
respected basketball program in order to save
the school's integrity and reputation.

While it is commendable that San Francisco
_chose_to.em.phasize its role as a eellege, it’s
regrettable all the same that such a drastic step
had to be taken. It is possible for athletics and
academics to co-exist, but only if certain stand-
ards are upheld by both sides.

The formation of a committee to look into
ways to do this is a positive first step. Some of
the areas the committee will investigate and
suggest solutions for are:

Othe pressure on coaches to continually win,
and how to prevent future abuse in athletics;

Ocommercialism in sports; ‘

Othe number of varsity players who graduate.

Dr. Edward Bozik, who replaced former
athletic director Cas Myslinski, said Pitt is hop-
ing to stress continuity as one way to stabilize a
sports program. I .

Undoubtedly the newly formed committee
will be looking at this and other possible solu-
tions to the conflict.

It is our hope that the committee's efforts"
result in workable solutions to the problems
involved with intercollegiate athletics. Unless
it can, other schools may follow the University
of San Francisco in choosing between sports
and academic integrity.

Drunk Driving Crakdwn:

  

Finding Causes And Penalties

By LARRY LUNSFORD

There has been a national
outcry against drinking and
driving. Several local and
national organizations have
sprung up to lobby local and
national lawmakers to the cause
against drunken driving and
several states have already
passed severe laws to deal with.
persons driving under the influ-
ence of alcohol, and in some
instances, drugs as well.

The National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
issued a report to Congress last
year saying that studies have
shown that 35 to 64 percent of

the drivers involved in fatal"

accidents had been drinking
prior to the accident. “Alcohol
also figured in large percen-
tages of other accidental deaths,
including as many as 50 percent
of those who die from falls, one-
half of adults who die in fires,
and up to 68 percent of drown-
ing vfictims,” the report said.

Noted among the accidental
deaths last year were screen stars
Natalie Wood and William
Holden. Reports issued said
their deaths—the former by
drowning and the latter due to a
fall—were alcohol related.

New and tougher drunk driv-
ing laws have been enacted
within the past year in 22 states.
Two organizations, Remove
Intoxicated Drivers and Moth-
ers Against Drunk Drivers, have
been influential in getting the
new legislation passed. A
national committeenamed by
President Reagan and chaired
by Vice President George Bush
has also been charged with
looking into the increasing
prblems associated with alco-
hol abuse.

Associated Press writer
Timothy Harper reported that
in Montana, police have set up
a statewide hotline for citizens
to report drunk drivers. In the
first three. months, 243 calls
resulted in 44 arrests. He said
that in Tonawanda, NY, a sub-
urb of Buffalo, the police set up
roadblocks at midnight at busy
intersections and stopped every
car to look for drunk drivers.
Finally, judge Clayton Shea
not only takes away licenses of
those arrested for drunk driving
in Cincinnati; he takes away
their auto plates, too.

According to Dick Smyser,
secretary of_the Associated Press
Managing Editor's Society. “In
Vermont, one of the nation's
smallest states. during I98!

alone there were 41,000 arrests
for drunken driving. In each of
the last ten years, drunken driv-
ers were involved in accidents
that killed 25,000 "persons.
That’s 25,000 persons EACH of
those years. And the figures are
for the Un-ited States alone.”

Undoubtedly the problem is
severe since alcohol is a factor in
10 percent of all deaths in the
United States and one in 10
adult drinkers is likely to
become an alcoholic or have a
drinking problem. The new
laws are just, but in some cases,
they’re not severe enough.

The anti-drunken driving
cause is growing and intensify-
ing, and it should be. However,
as much attention that is being
focused on the problems should
also be focused on formulating
solutions as well as on the
causes in the first place.

Telling people not to drink
will not work. Jail sentences
work better than merely sus-

pending licenses; yet, these
same people will probably still
have the same drinking prob-
lem once released from jail. The
many groups lobbying for new
legislation and researching the
effects of alcohol abuse must
make recommendations to deal
with the problems. It is com-
mon sense that if bars exist
where people must drive in
order to drink, and that in many
cases theyleave and drive under
the influence of alcohol, some-
thing must be done at the place
of consumption to curb the
potential to drive drunk. The
burden of the latter responsibil-
ity must be shared with the
authorities.

The citizen effort against

‘drunken driving (as well as

against other alcohol-related
situations) should continue,
but we hope that such efforts
will also extend to education
about the causes as well as the
effects.

Keeping the       
Public Informed

News and
Publications
Promotes Universi

Keeping the public informed about a large univer-
sity and the people associated with it is a big job. In
fact, there are two ‘publications and a public rela-
tions department for just that purpose at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.

“Our responsibility is to promote the university. .

We do it by way of the media, by responding to
media requests to talk about university areas orto
ask questions about specific subjects,” said Daryl
Clemmens, assistant director of News and Publi-
cations, who manages the news bureau.

The department of News and Publications in the
division of Public Affairs is the university’s arm to
the media. It publishes things about the university,‘
tells the world what’s going on here and publishes
the University Times. '

‘According. to Clemmens, the news bureau is
essentially a liaison between the university and the
public’ which tries to meet the needs of the
community. *

“For_ example, if a professor has done research
which has some significance to the general or pro-
fessional community,we assess the promotional
possibilities by reading what we can and then-deter-
mining what medium it would appeal to,” she said.

Clemmens said that the press release used to be
the standard way of informing the public about uni-
_versity news. Today, however, the press release is

outmoded, except for ‘giving the public basic,

information.

“Now we spend a lot of time on the phone market-
ing a specific story. We like to get one good solid
piece rather than two or three tiny mentions,” she
said.

Keeping in touch with everything that happens at

I Pitt is a tough job. Clemmens said that “some peo-
V’ ple are familiar with us because of what we did for
..them before, but we have to keep reminding big

sections about us. We try to maintain contacts
within each school.”

She also said that “we get notifications of -

research grant awards which allows us to determine

‘what faculty members are in what areas, even

though the research won’t be inthe news for a

_ couple of years.”

“Our network of contacts has become pretty

I solid over the past few years,” she added.

- I One problem that Clemmens has is that people
 .don’t understand what PR is or why it’s necessary.”

_ “Our feeling is that there are three areas faculty

vmembers are responsible for. They are teaching,

research and community service, such as speakng

p engagements,” she said.

“We feel that PR is one way faculty members can

 use‘ their community service dimension,” she said.

 -' Clemmens added that “the vast majority of the
f‘ faculty we deal with are very cooperative, but every
n _o_.n*c'_:_e in a while we have to educate.”

.  She went on to say why she thinks PR is impor-
tant. “We are a tax supported institution and the

taxpayers of the commonwealth have a stake in the
university. We have a different kind of relationship
with them than a Duquesne or a Point Park because
of our state funding.” «

“We also have an intellectual responsibility to

keep the public abreast of what’s happening at the
university because very often it’s the next break- ’
through,” she said. ’

Insuring that the university maintains its good

reputation is also part of public relatios, but Clem-
mens said that “when you’re talking about the good
name of the university, we’re\ not the only ones who
have an impact in it—everyone does.

“People are the best or worst PR vehicles. All you
can do is recognize the fact that you’re dealing with
human beings. In a major urban institution, some-
times things aren’t pleasant, but it’s reality and you
have to deal with it,” she said.

What’s New
at Pitt  

While the news bureau informs the public about
what’s‘ happening at Pitt, Pitt Magazine and The
Alumni Times inform alumni about their alma
mater.

Pitt Magazine is a quarterly publication but out bu
News and Publications which contains 12 pages of
news about the university,_as well as a 12 page
supplement which is usually written by members of
Pitt’s faculty.

The supplement usually has articles about cur-’

rent international issues, such as the situation in
Central America. University news covers the range
of teaching, research and development, problems
and issues facing the university, and how the univer-
sity deals with these matters. ‘

Now in a newsprint tabloid form, the magazine
was originally in a standard 8x10 magazine format,
but could only be sent to a small fraction’ of the
graduates due to the cost. ,

Today, Pitt Magazine has a circulation of about
140,000 made up of faculty members, trustees,
members of the business community and graduates

and friends of theuniversity. It shares a mailinglist

with The Alumni Times.
According to Alta Rusman, news editor of -the
magazine, “the production process is meticulous-

it takes about six weeks.” Three designersfrom‘

News .and Publications take turns putting the maga-
zine together. '

“We try to take advantage of the longer cycle to I

do more comprehensive stories,” said Rusman.
Articles for the magazine are submitted by faculty

mation, which eventually reaches approximately 140,000

single-handedly.

Alumni Timeseditor Ruth Kline puts the paper together

members, but Rusman said that there are not a lot of
submissions. It’s hard to stay in touch with what’s

‘happening because the production cycle is so long,

so we get a lotof information from News and ‘Publi-
cations,” Rusman said. V i . .
“We stay in touch with The Alumni Times’ so we
don’t write about the same things,” she said.
i The Alumni Times is also a quartertly publication,
but according to editor Ruth Kline, “its focus is on
activities and human interest stories about what’s
going on in the lives of the alumni.” . .-
It regularly includes a section called “Alumni -in
the News,” as well as news from the four Pitt clubs.
There are Pitt_clubs in West Moreland, East Hills,-
South Hills and Bradford. The Alumni Times covers
events at the meetings and previews what’s coming
UP-. I
The fall issueof The Alumni Times is -the blue
book issue. It contains a summary of the Annual
Giving Fund campaign. Kline, who works on the
publication by herself, said that “it’s very time-

A consuming trying to digest the statistics of ‘the

campaign.”

According to Kline, The Alumni Times was origi-
nally published as The Alumni Review, a magazine
with advertisements. Today, it has no ads and is a
newspaper in tabloid form. '

Although it has the same circulation as Pitt Maga- _ '

zine, it is runthrough the-Development of Alumni

I Affairs office. ,_ . V _
Kline said that “about 120,000inames are on the ‘

alumni list. A lot of non-alumni friends and contribu-
tors are also recipients.”

The mailing list is computerized and updated by a .

large staff. A national newspaper clipping service
also helps The Alumni Times to keep up with alumni
lives.

When Former Panther Coach
Jackie Sherrill vacated his position
for the greener pastures at College
Station, Texas, he left behind a
closet full of talented players.
Returning are 18 of 22 starters and
an All-America quarterback. A
pretty thoughtful going away pres-
ent for Foge Fazio, his successor.

However, his; rather _, abrupt
departure, Sherriil also left behind

The superior competition this
yeargwill make the quest for a
national championship a steep
climb, but the Panthers are notjust
any team. From the secondary to
the special teams, they are ready to
commence their tough schedule at
full speed ahead.

The Panthers begin their climb
on Sept. 9 against North Carolina.
The game is significant for both
teams.

It will be the initial testing
ground for Panther coach Foge
Fazio, making his coaching debut.
It will also be a measuring stick for
the Tar Heel’s Kelvin Bryant-the
6-2, 195 tailback——and for the rest
of the North Carolina squad to
reveal‘ if they deserve their high

v ranking.

sive unit.

The Tar Heels’ front line is also
strong, with two All-Conference
guards returning—David Drechs—
ler (6-4, 250) and Ron Spruill (6-2,
250).

Another strength of the Tar
Heels’ is their defensive line. Wil-
liam Fuller (6-3, 250), jack Perry
(6-1, 156), Steve Fortson (6-2, 230)
and Mike Wilcher are returning.

On Sept. 18 the Panthers face

another nationally rated team,
Florida State. Coach Bobby
Bowden, who has had seven

straight winning seasons at FSU,
has built a powerful offensive unit.
Bowden has his choice of Blair
Williams or Eric Thomas at quar-
terback, both possesing strong and
accurate arms. Once again, he is
relying .on the strategy of score
more-win more, for the Seminole

defense lackisfin depth and quality.

Leading the way is cornerback

' Harvey Clayton and safety Larry

Harris. ‘

But even with the defense, the
Seminoles, with their 12 returning
starters, will supply stiff opposi-
tion for the Panthers. ‘

After Florida State comes Illi-
nois, where the Panthers meet their
only Big Ten opponent. Although
Illinois’ defense is somewhat weak,
they compensate with a powerful
offensive game. Quarterback Tony
Eason has considerable amount of
talent. Illinois’ head coach Mike
White has a good crop of receivers
returning, including Oliver Willi-
ams, who crushed most of the
school records last season and
Kirby Wilson. And, although their
offensive line is weak, they can rake
up yardage on the ground with
tailback Joe Curtis.

Although “Luck" has vanished
in the West Virginia roster, there
may be a trace of it (or him) left in
the quarterback slot, Jeff Hostetler.

record of 61 passes. The mountain-
eers should be able to pick up
ground with another 1981 red-
shirter, fullback Eldridge Dixon.
With nine starters returning, the
Hoopies will be hunting for
Panther hide come Oct.2.

At this year's annual Homecom-
ing game, the Panthers will play
host. to the Temple Owls. Temple
will not present much of a prob-
lem; they have always been a team
over whom the Panthers have
elected to trample year after year.
The Owls most troublesome ques-
tion mark is where to finda skillful
quarterback. Coach Wayne Hard-
ing still has no answer. Temple
does have a respectful defensive
line and secondary. However, with
Dan Marino directing the flow‘ of
Panther momentum, Temple will
probably become merely a hurdle
in the 1982 season.

The next game scheduled after
Homecoming will be on Oct. 23.
The Panthers will fly north to bat-
tle the Orangemen of Syracuse and
squeeze the hopes of an upset right
out of them. Coach Dick MacPher-
son has coined the phrase, “Start-
ing from scratch” because that is
exactly his chore this year.

Lost to graduation was Lil’ Joe
Morris, the Orangemen’s all—time
leading rusher, quarterback Dave
Warner and All-Ameri(:a place
kicker Gary Anderson. Syracuse is
weak in almost every postion-the
opposite of the Panther roster.
However, the Orangemen do have
the home field advantage, which
could present a problem—the only
problem.

It is back to the slopes of “Car-
diac Hill” forthe next game sche-
duled on Oct. 30. This game is
against Louisville, a team with 15
returnees. Two of these returnersi
are the awesome linebackers Mike
Trainor and Jay Trautwein. They
will try their best to keep the
amount of Panther yardage lower
than their jersy numbers. Keith
Humphries is also back, he
stunned Cardinal opponents with
his spectacular catches and punt
returns. Strong? Yes. But the Cardi-
nals will h_ave to escalate several
notches to expect a victory. Several?
Let's try many.

There are two games that have
been sold out for months now; one
is the traditional Penn State rivalry
and the other one is against the
team that finished last year with a

Exciting, huh, Panther basket-

country visiting Pitt on a regular
basis, future first round draft choi-
ces performing right before your

Sounds great, but behind the

sunshine lies a streak of clouds.
Like a relatively young and inexpe-
rienced team, which, except for
junior forward Clyde Vaughan,
proved inconsistent last season.

‘Like a team entering perhaps the

best conference in America without
an established center. Like a team
that lost two lightning quick and
talented guards-Dwayne Wallace
and Darrell Gissendanner——to
graduation.

Can Pitt enjoy immediate suc-
cess in the Big East?

can—his body resembles that of

. The halfback: A compact
bundle of instant speed flyingl
past the gigantic lineman. One
of the glamour positions in
football. With halfbacks come
1,000-yard seasons, All-America
status and Heisman Trophies.
The fullback: a different
story. A slow, bulky. plugger.
The Woody Hayes type of
back—three yards and a cloud
of dust. His main responsibility
is to block so that the halfback
can gain yardage. Pitt’s full-
back last year, Wayne DiBar-
tola, fit this description of a
fullback. I
Marlon McIntyre came to Pitt
as a halfback last year with
impressive credentials. He
rushed for over 2,600 yards

Belle Vernon High School.
After spending his freshman
year on speciality teams and see-
ing some spot ‘action in lop-
sided games, Panther coaches
persuaded McIntyre to switch to
the fullback position.

“I liked the suggestion,”
McIntyre said. “I just wanted to
play.”

The main problem in con-
verting Mclntyre into a fullback
was teaching him blocking tac-

while earning three letters at‘

tics. As a halfback, Mclntyre
wasn't required to do much
blocking, but blocking is a pre-
requisite for the fullback
position.

Despite the problems he had
in spring practice, McIntyre
said he now feels more comfor-
table at the position.

“I’m doing well so far,” he
said. “I’ve been practicing
blocking ever since spring
practice.”

Head-coach Foge Fazio is also
pleased with McIntyre’s pro-
gress since the spring.

“He has really improved a lot
since spring practice,” Fazio
said. “He’s blocking much bet-
ter now. He accepted the role
very well.”

McIntyre’s goals upon enter-
ing Pitt were very modest—'
work hard and get some playing
time. i

“I wanted to make the travel-
ling team,” he said. “I also
wanted some playing time to
get used to college football.” \

This year, McIntyre is still
keeping his sights level.

“I haven’t set any goals as of
yet,” he said. “I'd like to make
first-team fullback and try to do
my best.”

There are several challengers

Mclntyre Switches From Half To Fullback

to displace Mclntyre from his
starting .fullback spot. Marc
Bailey and Bill Beach would
have been the most serious, had
they not suffered injuries dur-
ing fall camp. And Bill Calla-
han, a freshman from Valley
High School in New Kensing-
ton,,has impressed the coaching
staff; he should see some action
at the position.

“They make me work hard,”
Mclntyre said of the competi-
tion at fullback. “They could
take my job if I make ,a
mistake.”

Certainly, McIntyre’s physi-
cal and mental attitudes have
earned him the starting full-
back position. He built himself
up to 217 pounds without los-
ing any speed, thanks to his
dedication in the weight room.

“He wants to play and make a
contribution," said Fazio.

McIntyre has no. goals of
gaining 1,000 yards, earning
All-America status, or winning
the Heisman Trophy. He just
wants to contribute to a
national championship.

It's this attitude that has
earned McIntyre_ a starting spot
on the Pitt football team in the
first place.

Lights at Pztt Stadium...

According to athletic director
Edward Bozik, Pitt Stadium will
have lights by next September,
pending a study of proposals on
setting up the poles. ~

“If found feasible, Pitt Stadium

could have lights by September,”
Bozik said.
I The problem may be with the
ground around the stadium. In
order to put up standards, they
must be placed on a solid founda-
tion. However, there are empty
mines under the stadium, which is
making the Engineering Design
Feasibility study take longer than
expeded.

Bozik said that they may have to
attract the lights, to the stadium,
which would require the loss of
seats.

Bozik added that when the study
is complete, proposals will be
made to Chancellor Wesley Posvar,
who is committed to the construc-
tion of lights depending on how

beneficial the project would be to

the university.

"Construction would have to start
by January to be completed for the
1983 football season.

According to Bozik, the lights
wouldn't necessarily mean night
games would be held at the Sta-
dium, but it would give Pitt the
ability to show a game at 4 p.m.
instead of starting in the early
afternoon.

“For example, Bozik said, ‘if we
had lights, we could have moved
the West Virginia game to four in
the afternoon in order to get a
regional broadcast with one of the
two networks. That would be a
missed opportunity to get on
television.”

“In the past five years,” he con-
tinued, “there were a number of
times were we could have sche-
duled games at 4 o’clock in order to
be shown on television.”

Bozik has not ruled out the possi-
bility of playing night games.

“We’re not sure if we will have
night football or not,” he said. “If
it’s a way to boost attendance,'it
would be alternative.”

record of :3-6 and is totally absent
from any pre-season polls. A team
that didn’t even break into the top
ten sells out a game?

When the name I\'otre Dame
appears, all doubts are resolved. In
the game scheduled for Nov. 6, the
Panthers will appear in front of a
sold-out house against the dynasty
turned sour. Last year was labeled a
“learning experience" for coach
Gerry Faust. When starting out, a
coach is entitled to make some mis-
takes; Faust definately made his
share.

However, after a year of criticism
and experience, Faust is ready to
start anew, and is determined to
put the Irish back on the winning
track. The quarterback position is
semi-weak, but their running
power is trememdous. Phil Carter
(who rushed for 712 yards while
plagued with injuries) and Greg
Bell will be carrying the ball most.
of the season for the Irish.

The brilliant wide receiver Joe
Howard will also aid in raking up
the footage this year. The spot light
for the defense of Notre Dame will
turned to pre-season All-America
Dave Duerson (6-3, 200) who will
do his best to hinder the offensive
game of the Panthers.

Although they will not be the
Notre Dame of Powerhouse past,
they still will be no push-over-
they have the Irish pride to defend.

The cadets of Army fame will be
the next opponent for the Panthers
on Nov. 13. Army has an expe-
rienced offensive backfield, so
experienced that all of the members
of this corp are returning. Gerald
Walker is back; he will be striving
for 725 more rushing yards to break
the Army record previously held by
Glenn Davis (2,957). Top defensive
players for the Cadets are line-
backer Dan Kessler, end Bob Wood
and Mike Williams, the team’s
leading tackler. The Cadets are
always super—psyched for the
Panthers, this year looks no
different.

Coach Frank Burns of the
Rutgers’ football team, who will be
next on the Panthers heavy sche-
dule, was in for a rude awakening
when his star quarterback Ralph
Leek abruptly withdrew from

‘' school, foregoing his senior year of

eligibility. Last year’s back-up,
Keith Hudak will most likely be
appointed to fill the vacant
position.

The Scarlet Knights’ strength is
in the linebacker position. The
team of Keith Woelzel, who led the
team with T101 tackles, and Jim
Dumont create a net for running-
backs and‘ quarterback screens
alike. Rutgers’ also has one of the

‘toughest in their school's history.

They not only have to contend
with the Panthers, but a host of
other top notch teams: Penn State,

   

W‘.’I' and Auburn. to name a few.
The last scheduled game for the
regular season is the annual intra-
state bout against Penn State.
Although Penn State is not as
strong as they have been pre-
viously, the Nittany Lions are not
about to go down easy. Last year’s
devastating loss was a giant blow to
the Panthers standing and ego.
Come Thanksgiving weekend, the
Panthers will still have a trace of
vengeance in their systems.

Coach Joe Paterno has once
again created a well-rounded team
that will fair well with the best.
Leading the way is All-America
candidate Kurt Warner, one of the
best running backs in the team’s
astute history. Calling the plays
will be the vastly improved Todd
Blackledge.

With both teams’ intensity at its
highest peak, this year’s rivalry
promises to be once again “the
clash of the best the East hasito
offer.” g

It is then off to a bowl game. The
Panthers will again shoot for the
sweetest one. \

Well there it is, the 1982 Panther
schedule. The Panthers definitely
have their work cut our for them if
they expect to attain the rank most

"polls have predicted but if the

Panthers emerge withia victorious
record, nobody can say they are not
deserving ofgthe No. 1 rank.

Ujevich Working To Become Four- Time All-America

By scon DELLETT

Hard working is the best way to
describe Lady Panther swimmer
Jan Ujevich. No matter how much
she achieves, she is usually never
satisfied with her performance.

For example, after the 1981
AIAW championships, Ujevich
was not completely happy with her
perfomance: earning All-America
honors in all five events at
Nationals.

Even after gaining All-America
honors again last season, Ujevich
looked for more out of herself.

“I really did expect a little more
than I accomplished lastgseason,"
Ujevich said.

Head coach David Belowich sees
Ujevich's attitude and believes it’s
right for her.

“Jan has the correct mental
approach to swimming,” Belo-
wich said. “She isn’t satisfied with
a little bit—-she wants a lot. This
makes her the competitor that she
is."

Ujevich didn't always have the
competitive fire burning inside
her. After her freshman year at
Florida, where she gained All-
America status in five events, ‘she
was not satisfied with her progress
because of the training methods at
the school. '

1980 Olympic trials, she trans-
ferred back to Pitt where she had
previously spent several years on
the Pitt Aquatic Club.

Even in her sophmore year Uje-
vich was having problems, as she
gained 30 pounds during the sea-
son and considered giving up the
sport.

Then Belowich came along and
varied the training procedure of
swimming practice, thus restoring
some of Ujevich’s enthusiasm as
she prepares for her senior year.

Since she is only one of three
seniors on the squad, Ujevich must
assume some of the leadership
duties. This responsibility takes on
more importance as several fresh-
man will enter the program.

“Jan is a team-oriented
swimmer,” Belowich said. “This
year's team will need her leader-
ship. She'll accept the role very
well, and she'll be important to the
team in the process.”

Ujevich will be trying to achieve
All-America status for the fourth
straight year. Belowich believes she
will have an advantage in reaching
thispeak since she has become
familiar with Pitt’s program.

“Basically, I had to change some
of the swimmers’ thought pro-
cesses last year,” Belowich said.
“They were told in the pastthat by
the time they become seniors in col-

All-America for the fourth

lege, they are over the hill as
swimmers. A

“I had to plant the seed that
swimmers could have the best year

of their career during their senior

year in college,” Belowich said.
This statement’s truth was

shown with last year's senior crop
as five of the six Lady Panthers
achieved lifetime best marks.
“This proved what I thought;
that a different kind of thinking
will make you successful,” Belo-
wich said. “I had the swimmers

create a picture that they could
make their goals a reality.”
Another advantage Ujevich has
is the lack of training she had in the
pool over the summer. Ujevich
enters the season excited to get back
into the pool.
“I took the summer off to get
credits working for the Pittsburgh
Spirit public relations department
and the Sports Information Office
at Pitt,” she explained. “I kept in
shape by running, cycling and
"working with the Nautilus
machines. I really think taking a
break has helped me. I’m excited to
get back into the water.”

- One disadvantage is Pitt's
entrance into the NCAA this year.
In the past, Pitt participated in the
AIAW, where one could achieve
All-America honors by placing in
the top 16. This year, under NCAA
rules, the top six finishers will be

y named All-America.

Ujevich realizes it will be more
difficult, but she takes it in stride.

“It will be harder in the NCAA’s,
but hopefully, my best time will get
me All-America‘ honors,” Ujevich
said. ‘fl just want to make my last
year my best year. I’m going to try
to work on the things I did wrong
in order to improve."

Belowich adds, “Jan is always
trying to be the best she can possi-
bly be.” I

This would be proven by her
becoming Pitt's sixth four-time
All-America athlete.

,, Panthers Will Find The Going Tough

i

 The Pitt News, Wednesday, September 1*, E1982

continued from page seventeen

ment the past two years, despite
playing less than sensationally
during the regular season. At
times, the guards were too quick
for their own shoes; Their passes
often sailed out of bounds. Good
foul shooting was rare, especially
late in the game, and Andre Willi-
ams, a forward by nature, was play-
ing at center. And the team was
inconsistent.

Sometimes the Panthers played
like world beaters. They defeated
Tennessee in the Far West Classic,
beat Temple at the Penn Palestra——
a place where Pitt never seems to
win—-and twice played highly-
ranked West Virginia to a virtual
standstill durin.g the regular sea-
son, before clobbering the Moun-
taineers in the Eastern .8
Tournament. "

At other times, Pitt resembled
soggy cornflakes. There was a 30-
point loss to Oregon State in that
same Far West Classic, a 17-point
loss to Alabarna—Birmingham, a
scant two point victory over Div-
ision II school Davis and Elkins
and less than impressive victories
over Robert Morris and Utica
College.

Determination took the Panth-
ers to the NCAA tournament last
year. Surely, there were more tal-
ented teams in the Eastern 8.
Rutgers has the intimidating cen-

' ter, Roy Hinson, and a supporting

cast good enough to defeat UCLA.
West Virginia had Greg Jones-
thought by many to be the best
guard in the country—and a§»bruis-
ing front line that carried the
Mountaineers into the top 10 by
mid-season. A ’

But it’s unlikely that the Panth-

ers can win the Big East tourna-

ment on /hustle alone. It was
enough to lift‘ Pitt over Hinson and

Rutgers, or Jones and West Virgi-
nia, but now comes Ewing and the

Hoyas. Now comes big-time
basketball.
Not that Pitt has no talent.

Vaughan is a future first-round
draf.t choice, and sophomore guard
George Allen and center Andre
Williams showed considerable
potential toward the end of last
season.

Here, the clouds form. The"

Panthers need a center so Williams
can move back to forward. Keith
Armstrong, a 6-8 freshman noted
for his rebounding and defensive
play, appears the leading candi-
date, though he’s still untested at
the college level.

Charles Thompson and Billy
Culbertson—neither of whom saw
much playing time last season-
will battle for the open guard spot.

Behind them are two freshmen—.

Bryan Mitchell and Joey David.

There are many questions, like
where the Panthers will finish in
the Big East. Vaughan predicts
fourth. Sixth might be closer to

reality. It’s hard to picture Pitt

beating Georgetown, Boston Col-
lege, St. john’s or Syracuse. And
Villanova is much better than
when they played in the Eastern 8.

Still, Pitt’s move to the Big East
was a step in the right direction.

The Eastern 8 was a cobblestone.
