interests. She could not.work on

themes were subsequently pub-

 ,I.ct’s Prove

That We Can Take It

Last week Mr. Quick announced the change in the pro-
cedure for final exams. It was interesting to listen to the re-
actions to that announcement. In some cases, it was pathetic.

Some students grumbled. Some argued that it is unfair
to have extra hours of class. Others said that extra class hours
were easier to take than two-hour exams. Still others were
too confused to express any opinion, but they were sure they’d

- never understand the new set-up.

- There is something pathetic about that. We are in college
because" we want to get training for our lives after we leave
school. We have different speciﬁc plans for our lives, but we
are all here for that one purpose. There are some genera.l

., principles which we must all learn if we expect to be happy

' or if we want to be good citizens. If we do not learn these

principles, 3 point averages and honorary fraternity pins

.won’t mean a thing. '

_ Cooperation, honesty, perseverance—these principles are

important in whatever ﬁeld we enter after graduation.

And one thing we must all learn to do is to accept change.

Men and women in the business World are forced to change

their plans all the time. They have to be calm about it and

' . make the best of the situation. Otherwise, they would lose
» their jobs or their business.

' Men and women se_rving in the armed forces have had to
accept sudden and extreme changes. After being raised on a
theory of individualism, they have to accept military disci-
pline which does not concern itself with the individual. Only
those who can take it have succeeded.

_ . I. We have all met changes in the last few years. Some of
 ‘ ' us have been forced to change our “major” or “minor” here
“ . at school. Some have been forced to leave, school. Others, who
never dreamed of going to college, are attending classes under
. , army. or navy supervision. We have seen our school converted
 into an army barracks. Our program of activities have been
' “’.' curtailed and changed. We know, then, that we can take it.
We have done it before. We must do it again—and again. We
might as well do it with a smile.

, Changes we must accept at school are usually minor ones.

 By learning how to accept them, we are learning. a basic rule

{ 1 for happy living. If we cannot accept them, how can we ever
I. -,hope_to accept major changes which are bound to come ?

Every service star in the window of America represents
some man or woman who has changed the original plan for
, life. Every gold star ‘represents a drastic change which some
' family group had to face.

r We cannot escape it. The postwar years will not be ex-
- , actly like “the good old days.” We would not want them to be.

;-ft ~ Progress depends upon change. ,
‘  Now is the time to learn how to take it.
A‘ H " 0 o b "0
e W e palm‘ wzt pride . . .
 Pitt can take a great deal of pride in the recognition ac-
- corded Dr. Lotte Olga Lohstoeter by her Civil Affairs Training
School students. The story is detailed on page 3 of this issue,
 ‘ but we feel that there is special signiﬁcance in one statement
‘_ p of the citation—“coupled with your sound teaching methods,
' iyour loyalty, your sincerity, your wholesome humor, we have
also found in you a truly Christian philosophy of life.” That
statement is an excellent summation of the things Pitt has
long known and loved her for.

German-born, she has been a true American in every
sense of the word. For her there were never any barriers of
 race, color, or creed, for she has helped all. She has worked
 -3' ceaselessly for the war, effort and much of that energy ha.s
' stemmed from her own desire to make up for what has gone
. on in her native Germany.

"ii Lotte Lohstoeter is representative of Pitt'at its best. We
~ congratulate her for an honor well deserved.

headers in one coke (the coke stuck
in just for coloring) sounded pret-
ty good at ﬁrst. “The only trouble
was,” Johnny complained, “the stuff
evaporated in my month before I
had a chance to swallow it.”
“Oh, I've got gobs and gobs of
love for the Navy.” Yep. This has
been Nancy Hardy’s theme. song
ever since ‘her Bill came. home for

chimes, of wedding bells ? / ’

Readthis one fast folks: once
there was a big molice pan, and
he met a bittle lum sitting on the

Said the big molice pan to the
bittle lum, “S i m m e gume.”
“Can’t,” said the bittle lum, “Gol-

.la sot.” . I

could have fooled me.

Well, well . . . do I see’ a new ro-

 Lohstoeter Cited
 Work With CATS

.,.  When the Army moved into Pitt, many changes took place, not the
least of which concerned the teachers. For not only were they called upon
éil;o,,conduct classes under Army discipline but, in many cases, to teach
 -inien who had been away from school so long that they had forgotten how
 study. This was especially true of the group of Civil Affairs Training
- ﬁchool students who recently concluded their work here. The success of
]},one. Pitt professor in teaching these men-—ranging from second lieuten-
" {nuts to colonels—-—is shown by the special citation they sent to her at the
iqénclusion of their studies.

I 7’ To Dr. Lotte Olga Lohstoeter, assistant professor of modern
7"l'a:nguage, the Class I, Civil Aﬁairs Training School, University
pf, Pittsburgh, was sent a cita- <‘v
ftion in care of Chancellor Bow-
xman, signed by members of the
’ lass, reading, “We approached

1920 after teaching at the Thurston
Preparatory School. She attended
the Universities of Berlin, Heidel-

After one look at the bandaged swollen jaws and the big dental

“to see their dentist twice a year.”

These caricatures are part of it collection of engravings, litho-

This is war and chemistry is out
to do its part to help win the war.
Chemistry means research and,
like many other of the scientiﬁc
ﬁelds, has turned all its attention
to ﬁnd and develop materials that

will be of maximum,‘ beneﬁt to the-
immediate war effort. A great deal"

of this pure scientiﬁc research,
whose immediate results are often
intangible but form the basis of
most scientiﬁc investigation,’ is
taking place in universities and in-
dustrial chemical laboratories all
over the world.

Many of these so-called impossi-
bilities have turned out to be re-
markable developments. The man-
ufacture of synthetic rubber, the
production of gasoline from coal,
the synthesis of sulfa drugs, and
many more have become subjects
for every-day discussion; while
many more new and signiﬁcant tri-
umphs of American chemistry are
veiled in secrecy.

Here at Pitt, the chemistry de-

partment. is striving . to maintain
a vigorous program of experi-

mental study. A large number of I

graduatexstudents are engaged in
part or full-time research work in
active‘ collaboration with the
staff, its post doctorate fellows,
and with other departments and
research organizations. Although

their wounded buddies on the bat-
tlefield.

The caternal instinctsof Co. H
men were brought to light last week
when a homeless kitten found its
way into one of the barracks.

Starting from sc_ratch, the visitor
made quite a few ‘friends among the
soldiers, who fed, petted, and
played with him (or is it a “her”?)

The cat’s familiarity with the
men may. be somewhat indicated by
the following bedtime story. Sud-
denlypawakening about 3 a. m. a
few mornings ago, we found our-
selves staring into a couple of
green, Scarlett O'Hara eyes. How-
ever, after a few seconds, we real-
ized (to our disappointment) that
it wasn’t Scarlett on our pillow after
all. A

So with a slap on the puss, we
turned over in our bed once more
and were soon gone with the ‘wind.

If the walls of the Cathedral sud-
denly cave in one of these days, you
can probably blame it on the shrill
musical notes of the ocarina.

Pvts. Bernard Chojnacki and Jim
Mann of the 4th Platoon, Co. A, the
two modern J ericho’s, have been
amusing their barracks mates with

—nightly (and expertly played) com-
positions. .

All AST masters of the ocarina,
a small, heart-shaped mouth organ,
are urged to see the aforementioned
men who are trying to organize a
small band.

We hope we haven’t ended /the
column on a sour note.

DR. PUTNAM F. JONES
. a . speaks to English teachers

Dr Jones will
Address Group

Dr. Putnam ‘F. Jones, "associate
professor of English at the Univer-
sity, has been invited to speak at the
spring meeting’ of the Western
Pennsylvania Association of Eng-
lish Teachers. ’

Dr. Jones has elected to speak on '

the topic “Writing the Popular
Magazine Story.” In this ﬁeld, Dr.
Jones has gained experience in
writing ‘for such magazines as “Col-
lier’s” and “This Week.”

Dr. Jones divides his interests be-
tween contemporary writing and
the study of language problems. He

has received recognition in writing"

for magazines "and other publica-
tions. Illustrative of his work and
scholarship on language studies is
his concordance of the Anglo-Saxon
chronicler, Bede. Mr. Jones also
teaches the course in the history of
the English language. .

Spanish Course ls Limited
To 16 Students Only

New intensive Spanish course
starting next semester will be lim-
ited to sixteen students. The ﬁrst
sixteen applicants making appli-
cation in Dr.’ Whitford Shelton’s
office, 2918, Cathedral, will be those
admitted to the course.

This civilian course in Spanish
will bejpatternedafter, the new
“functional methods”.used in the
language v departments for the
Army. It will be taught by native
teachers, which has proven to be
the best way to get a working
knowledge of a language.

Grammar will be taught in con-
nection with material as it comes
up in the course. No rules or
memorization of books will be re-
quired. The classes will concern
themselves with every-day conver-
sations and customs in Spanish.

Company News v I

By HARRISON ROGERS, JR.
The Inspector General’s repre-

sentative, who was here the ﬁrst of ;
the week, certainly made a hit with 
i the whole unit. He patiently listened ,
to what the men like to do most— .
complain. Whether the arguments 
will do any good or not, it certainly ' ‘

was fun while it lasted.

The company dances on Wednes-
day nights are fast growing into
quite an institution. The limited‘
number makes everyone much bet-

ter friends, except for the guys who: '2 i
‘can't go. At Company's dance at f
the Concordia Club made a big hit‘ '
with them—.—all we need now is more .
of thesedancesl ‘

Recently, a stray bat (no, a small‘

animal that ﬂies!) wandered into 7: .~
the 20th ﬂoor bo-udoirs and provided_ « ‘ * "

some non-G. 1. entertainment. The ,2
brave men of Company F grabbed .'

their_ brooms, donned their helmet

liners, snapped on their ﬂashlights  I
and went madly into battle. The.
Ack-‘Ack boys were in their glory, j

and the enemy was completely rout-
ed. -

-‘—Toujours l’amour! , .
A quarterly fad was revived this
week in A Company when “G. I. P.”

Golding came in after the lights .

were out to ﬁnd his bed gone and .~a_‘

short notice in its stead, explaining 2 '1

that it had been “shipped to West

Point” to await his arrival+he ﬁn- '

ally found his bed. The following

night this epidemic spread to,_aI1- ‘, T: 
other wing, and at one time or an— 
other during the evening, at least  
ﬁve men “shipped to West Point'.”. 
Eddy Cahn certainly was pigud ' v
of the girl he was introducing to "' " 
everyone at the Schenley, Saturday f  
night—he ought to be! Incidentally,  jg 

she's his wife—so wolves lie low! .
The cute little babes are back in

the Tuck Shop at night, which means . ~ 
but one thing—thcre’s to be another ‘ 1' \
“pay” dance. These dances are ' 
wasted time though, so you can ex-
pect half the AST to show up. Donft, 
these girls think of the darndest ‘ _
things when they're naming their 

dances it .

Joe Dudenhoefer of A Company ‘

and Henry Wolfson of F Company

.are vying withieach other, unknow- ' ' r ,-
ingly, for "the title of .“Sleeping 

Beauty (?)” They must be infested '  _‘
sleeping sickness, and’ the 5 2
worst part of the disease it is ex- Z  

with

tremely contagious.

Beginning February 2, the A

  I feel a little self-conscious about this, because I know
that no matter what I write, I shall feel damn silly if I should
happen to look at it ﬁve or three or even two years from now.
Farewell columns are like that, for tradition decrees that they
be made up of one part sentiment, one partconfession, two
parts fond memories, and a dash of wistful nostalgia.

. I think I've always felt rather like the country editor who,
in‘_;making out the almanac, scheduled a snowstorm for the
fourth of July. “Do you really think there is going to be a
snowstorm," someone asked. “No,” came the ~ reply, “but
i5vou1dn’t it be a‘ wonderful thing for me if there was.” When I
scheduled a sports writing career’ for myself, I hadn't any
idea as to how and if it would work, but I can say now that it
has been..“a wonderful thing for me." '

.'-,_. I’,lea,ve with the satisfaction of thinking, at least, that
I‘. proved the thing I have long contended-—-that there is only-
one angle to sports, and that isthe f n’s angle. Granted that
here is some special women's angle, would have to ‘confess
’t’o",not having the slightest idea as to what it is.

t. It has been a great deal of fun. There were the letters,
ncluding one from the War Department, that came in ad-
dressed to “Mr.” Elaine Kahn. And then‘ there was the time
during my sophomore year when I ghosted a series of articles
which, -presumably, were by members of the football team
explaining their respective positions. I got through the end
and tackle and/_the center articles without diﬂiculty, but then

time the quarterback essay. This was ‘supposed to be written
byXWa1ter West. However, there -was a slight mixup at "the
jrinters and, under my by-line, appeared the story beginning,‘
_fI»was sitting on the bench. Suddenly the coach turnedto me.-
Go in at quarterback,’ he said." Even thenit wouldn't have
‘jeeri too bad had it not been for Pitt's 40-0 loss to Michigan
he week before. There were some unkind enough tosuggest
hat NOW they knew why. _ .

« - And I shall ever cherish the memory of one -incident of
he Pitt-Bucknell baseball game two years ago. The Pitt
atcher whipped the ball tothe second baseman in an attempt
'9-tag the Bucknell player ‘off base. But the second baseman
izlropped the ball, whereupon the ‘obliging Bucknellian stooped

 
   
   
   
   
   
    
    
   
   
  
  
   
  
   
  
    
     
   
 
  
  
 
  
   
   
  
  

over, pickedit up, and handedit to him. . p .
V" l- “ In the matter of interest, I’ll still take last year’s “freeze”
“basketball game at Penn State. During itheﬁrst half,’ which
re ded in a 5-2 score, ‘the Carlson Kids failed to take a single
shot at the basket and even declined a foul shot. _

. 'I am inclined to hesitate a, littlebetween the 13-0' upset
,win over Fordham in 1941 and.this -y_e_a'r’s West Virginia con-
"rtest as the game that gave me. the greatest thrill. The nod, I
Eﬁhink, would go to West Virginia, not because. it was a par-'

5{c;ause football was by then rather a personal thing-and,* well,
‘because bread looks’ as good as a banquet to a starving man.

: ,_ . There is no hesitation about the greatest disappointment.
“That would be the Ohio State mess this year.’ ‘

. , To me, the best-at Pitt has been its people. My life at Pitt
“ihas generally been made up of two parts-—one that included.

‘all

 

A‘ Lohstoeter? belongs. Lotte Lohstoeter, who will leave ‘here so
shortly herself, has always symbolized Pitt to me more than
‘anyone else, -perhaps because -she made so much of it possible.
, lAnd after that comes Marie .McSwigan and Edwin Peterson,
 f£l£r.1John Ferguson and Mr. Biddle‘, and, of course, Bill Daufen-‘

. ac . ' V
V In that other world-—the world of sport-—Doctor Carlson r
,.comes, ﬁrst, although Clark Shaughnessy runs a very .close

fatigue curve, after all.

. II . ' Baseball coach Ralph Mitterling will have to be ﬁled away.

-under the heading of “unﬁnished business,” for I always
wanted to do a column on him and never did. I once spent
ian entire trip to Huntingdon trying to interview the coach,
. but at theconclusion of thethree-hour ride we had only gotten
 as far as his days in tlie Army as a sergeant. He still owes
,«  me that interview. '

'“f l_‘~ Perhaps one of the reasons I don’t feel too bad about leav-
‘_ zilng is that the best things—the friendship with people like
’ﬂllVIrs. Lohstoeter and Doc Carlson, Clark Shaughnessy and

f’ {taking with me.

;- _ Pitt has been good to me, and I am grateful. I have seen
 much that is ﬁne at Pitt and some that. isn’t.'Looking back,-
f . I feel that I could have done more. And journalistically, at
*:f’ . ‘least, I must deplore those columns that, on a backward glance,
 turnout to be not columns at all, but pep talks.

Phi Delts, Fijis
Stay Undefeated

By HERMAN FELDMAN

A tie in the intra -fratern-
ity I-M League continues on the bas-
is of results to date. Phi Delta The-
ta,- extending its unbeaten streak to
three games defeated Phi Epsilon Pi
again Wednesday by the score of
32 to 10. They defeated them 22-12
last Thursday. Phi Ep Gilbert scored
10 of his team’s points. '

Pi Kappa Alpha drubbed Pi
Lambda Phi 36-13 in ‘what must
have been a' peculiar contest. _

Gallagher totalled 17 points and
Wood doubled the point total, 6, of
vanquished Levy". - '

‘ The _Phi Gamma Delta’s at
present also have three victories
and no defeats.

Tomorrow in the prelim to.
the big game‘ with Penn. State
Alpha Phi Delta meets PiKA,
the game starting at 6:45. Today
Alpha Phi Delta meets the 5_Fs. The
result -of. yesterday's game between
SAE and the Delts didnot arrive
in time for publication. 9 . '

A-s of last Tuesday, four team
were tied for the lead in the Engi-
neering League, since only four
games had been played. Wednesday
night, however, the Electric ‘Engi-
neers defeated the Civil Engineers
29-18 and the Mechanical Engineers
took the measure of the Independ-
ents, 27-15.

The game between the Petroleum
and Aeronautical engineers sched-
uled‘ for -Monday was forfeited to
the Petroleums. when only‘ four
players showedup to represent the
Aeronauts. ‘Next Wednesday the

When asked, “How does the re-
search chemist manage to spend
most _of his time experimenting
and carry on intensive research
such as he is doing at the pres-
ent?” Dr. Stafford replied, “In un-
dertakings such as these, the ma-
terial support of many agencies
plays a very important role. Ade-
quate funds, facilities, and person-
nel are essential. In this, as in
other institutions, it is only
through the contributions of vari-
ous industrial organizations, re-
search foundations, government
agencies, individuals, and the Uni-
versity itself, that a healthy re-
search program is possible.

“It is this spirit of cooperation
that characterizes war-time re-
search today.”

Within the past few weeks, quilte
a number of Pitt men have received
leaves and furloughs and fortun-
ately have managed to squeeze 'a
visit to the Cathedral on the crowd-
ed agenda.

Ensign Gus Wilde, who just com-
pleted PT School at Rhode Island, is
one of our visitors of the week. His
brother Ralph recently received a
lieutenant’s commission at Fort
Monroe, “Va., and is now stationed
there. ,

Former Pitt News Business Man-

ager, Ed Tablak, now addressed as

Ensign stopped at school last week,
on leave from Moifat Field, Cal. Ed
spends his time piloting a Blimp.

As temporary relaxation from his
Chinese studies at Yale, Pvt. Hol-
bert Carroll visited Pitt, on a recent
furlough.

Congratulations to Lt. Tom Ste-
phenson who just recently received
his wings in the Army Air Corps
at Fort Sumner, New Mexico. His
leave in Altoona brought Tom home

to his wife and eighteen-month-old

daughter. When he returns to New
Mexico to serve as an instructor, Lt.

Stephenson will take his family with
him. _ '

" Cpl. Bob.Cook appeared in the
Tuck Shop this week, happy to be
able to say_ “Hello” to his.f1‘iends
again. Bob is stationed at Camp
Lee, Va., with the Quarter Master
Corps. . . '

From‘ «somewhere -overseas, Lt.

Ben Baskin writes: “I used to write
“Pit_tp_our;ri’ back in '36 and ’37, and

have a lot of stuff that would make

.a good overseas column . . . the c_en-

sorship, however, makes it impos-

O.
. O01/€17‘ T/aere

sible to send the stuff along.” Lt.
Baskin is in the Field Artillery, at-
tahed to the U. S. Transport Di-
vision as a Transport Commander.

Tom Westermatfs rank has been
upped to Captain. A graduate of
’-12, Tom is now at Camp Lee, Va.,
with his wife, the former Mary
Zarman.

Two other Pitt graduates home
recently were Orva Lee Ice, former
Heinz Chapel Choir Bass and Arnie

Manager. _Arnie is studying to be a
bombardier at Albuquerque, New
l\jIexic_o. '

experienced teachers, but 10 al-
ready have placements. One of the
teacher graduates, Lois Henderson,
has already been accepted into-‘the
WAVES. _

Although the number graduat-
ing this February is not signiﬁ-
cantly larger than last year’s
group, there is a larger percent-
age of undergraduates receiving
degrees than at any other time in
the history of Pitt.

‘Some of‘ the women graduat-
i g have shortened their four1col-

ll ge years by an entire year. Some

are entering various branches of
the service; others have jobs in
view. Many are leaving class,-fra-
ternity, and activity ofﬁcesa sem-
ester ahead of _ schedule because
they have adopted the nation’s slo-
gan as their own; FULIJSPEED
