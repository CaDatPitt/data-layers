Not all panhandlers "homeless"

By Mark Gordon
and John B. Moore
The Pitt News

A Pitt student goes into 7-11
and comes out with a Slurpee,
some Pez and $.35 change.

The student drops the change
in a ripped paper cup being
held by someone they think is
handicapped or homeless.

But according to an investi-

gation conducted by the
Department of Public Safety,
many of the panhandlers are
neither handicapped nor home-
less. Many are able—bodied with
criminal records that include
charges of assault and robbery.

“Some of these people are
not homeless, and the vast
majority of them have criminal
records,” said Public Safety
Director Rick Boyd.

Pitt Public Safety
Department’s plain clothes offi-
cers compiled this information
by patrolling the streets of
Oakland where the panhan-
dlers have entrenched them-
selves into the university set-
ting, according to a letter from
Boyd to Associate Vice
Chancellor for Business and
Finance John Devitto.

SETA participates in protest of animal disections

By Jearme Grol I,
For The Pitt News

Protestors dressed in scrubs
and lab coats handed out
whistleblower cards yesterday
in front of the David Lawrence
Convention Center as part of a
campaign to stop animal abuse
by the American Association
for Laboratory Animal
Science.

Pitt’s Students for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals (SETA)
handed out the cards.

AALAS is comprised of
vivesectors, people who per-
form experiments and dissec-
tions on live animals, from
around the world. The organi-
zation convened this week for
its 45th annual convention.

SETA said they are con-
cerned with the secrecy of
what goes on in the laborato-
ries and the vivisectors’ lack of
cooperation with the public.

“If vivisectors worked in
glass houses, they’d all be shut

WASHINGTON — The
Supreme Court ruled in favor
of the makers of BIC lighters
and upheld a decision against
anti-abortion militant Randall
Terry.

The court upheld an earlier
decision that the BIC Corp.
isn’t liable for the deadly house
fire started by a 4-year-old
child in Illinois. It ruled that the
warning appearing on the
lighter — “Keep out of reach
of children” —- was adequate.

The court also upheld the
decision that Randall Terry
would serve the ﬁve months in
jail to which he was sentenced
after masterrninding a scheme
to present President Clinton
with a fetus. Terry violated a
court order barring him and his
associates from approaching

Lifeboat drills are a common occurence —- every Saturday while at sea.

Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale 

Semester cat Sea students get their sec: legs, study and avoid o typhoon

(Tony F iorini is a Pitt junior on
Semester at Sea and a photographer
for The Pitt News.)

KOBE, Japan — I woke up in
Vancouver, Canada at 6 a.m. ready to
begin a journey that would take me
around the world. I made two calls
from the hotel room, one to get a taxi
to take me to the ship, and the other to
my father to say good-bye. I thanked
him again, and I said I’d call from
Japan. Arriving to the S.S. Universe is
something I will never forget. Knowing
the ship tied to the dock 100 feet or so
from where I was standing was going
to be my home for the next 100 days
was something I can hardly explain.
She looked so big then, but seems so
small after 14 days at sea.

Moving in was easy enough, and was
also a great way to meet people. While
waiting for the luggage to be loaded on
the ship, you could here conversations
start up, usually beginning with. “What
is your name?” closely followed by,
“Where do you go to school?” “Where
do you live?” and “Do you know any-
one on the ship?” As I waited there for
my bags, I couldn’t even tell we were
on water, but then again we weren’t
moving.

After all the bags were loaded, and

all the students were accounted for,
parents were permitted to board the
ship and say their last farewells until
Christmas time.

As I sat on a deck chair watching stu-
dents lead their parents on a tour of the
ship, I started to miss my own, and I
had only been gone for three days.
After about two hours, an announce-
ment was made that we were going to
be leaving, and all visitors should make
their way to the dock. We were an hour
away from sailing. On the sun deck, I
saw many hugs and tears as parents
wished their sons and daughters well
on their journey.

I could finally say I was on my way
when dock workers untied us from the
dock, and tug boats pulled the front of
the ship around to face the Pacific.
That night there was a meeting for
everyone aboard, explaining exactly
what would happen the next day. There
was some paper work to take care of,
and the formation of shipboard activi-
ties. By this time, you could definitely
tell the ship was moving, and seasick-
ness was running amok. The one nurse
who was feeling well enough to make
an announcement said, “If you start to
feel nauseous, go outside to get some
fresh air and look at the horizon line.”
She also mentioned that the doctor and

other nurse were feeling sick, if it was
any consolation.

With only one more day until classes
actually began, people set out to
explore their new home and make
some friends. Topics of conversation
included the bathrooms, the food and
the rough seas. I heard one person say,
“The bathrooms are so small that I can
open the door from inside the shower,
and it’s on the other side of the room.”
I also learned the hard way that you
have to pick your leg up when going
through any door on the ship. We were
constantly crossing time zones, and
every other night, at midnight, we set
our clocks back an hour, giving us 25
hours a day. When we crossed the
international date line, though, we lost
an entire day — Wednesday, Sept. 21,
didn’t exist for me.

After 14 days of classes, I have got-
ten to know my professors well, and it
is not uncommon to talk with them on
the sun deck or evenhave lunch with
them. This has its advantages. If you
have a question, you can most likely
find your professor, and unless he or
she is teaching another class, they are
more then glad to talk with you. I did,
however, see a student talking with
another classmate about a teacher and
how they did not understand some

things that were said in class, only to
turn around and find the teacher listen-
ing to their whole conversation. The
professor said he had talked to others
about the idea, and would be going
over it again the next day in class.
Then they got a laugh about what had
just happened.

It is Thursday, Sept. 29, and we
should have been in Japan this mom-
ing, but Mother Nature had other plans.
Typhoon Orchid is traveling up the
coast of Japan, heading directly for
Kobe, the city in which we were to
dock this morning. The ship’s captain
has slowed the ship, sometimes stop-
ping the ship all together leaving us
drift in the Pacific waiting for the
typhoon to pass so we could enter the
port. We should be there Friday at 5
p.m., 34 hours late.

In Japan, I am going to go to a
Japanese university, and stay with
one of the students at night. I am
looking forward to seeing how the
Japanese culture is really, compared to
what the typical American thinks of it.
It will undoubtedly be an interesting
and exciting first port.

I will be writing about my adven-
tures in Japan while we sail to Hong
Kong and mail it from there, so expect
it soon after this.

with the protestors, John Cihon, a member
of SETA, said most people did not accept
the whistleblower cards because they did
not want to deal with it.

“They work in secret and often don’t
publish papers for years and
years,” Glenn Grodin, co-
founder of Animal Passion

There are a lot of resources they’re not
exploring, and instead they are pouring it
all into the animal industry.”

One option McCafferty suggested was
the testing of humans. Many AIDS and
cancer patients are willing to test new

research facilities.

SETA also met Sunday in the William
Pitt Union to plan their involvement in the
Whistleblower campaign.

“We're trying to do as much as we can
to support what we believe in,”
McCafferty said.

Anne DeGryse, a member
of AALAS disagreed with
SETA, stating, “The commit-
tees are open to the public.
We invite people to read our
papers and listen to what we do.”

“There are definitely a lot of alternatives
out there,” Renee McCafferty, president of
SETA said. “It seems like a lot of money
is thrown away on animal testing that
could be put to use. I think a middle line

products on themselves. However, labora-
tories will not take the risk.

An estimated 60 to 100 million animals
are killed annually in U.S. labs, according
to Pittsburgh City Paper, February 3,
1993. As of 1993, 30,000 to 40,000 ani-
mals were at the University of Pittsburgh

actual footage of the cruelty
existing in slaughter houses
and laboratories.

“The message it conveys
is obvious. You can’t watch
animals go through this and
not think, ‘This is what my
food is before I eat it,”’ said Ryan Hughes,
a member of SETA.

SETA also discussed hosting a question-

vegetarianism. SETA will offer informa-
tion such as where to shop, what to eat and
what is healthy.

In the letter, Boyd wrote that
approximately 30 of these pan-
handlers account for a total of
over 400 arrests and 753 crimi-
nal charges. Out of those 30,
21 have permanent homes, two
are unaccounted for and seven
are actually “homeless.”

Also in the letter, Boyd stat-
ed that one of the individuals
observed by campus police
was identified as the person
responsible for robbing a park-
ing lot attendant at gunpoint
last week.

Pitt Public Safety is about to
institute a campaign to move
these people out of the streets
of Oakland. According to the
letter, Public Safety will be
offering support to the efforts
of the Pittsburgh City Council
to draft an anti—panhandling
ordinance.

Boyd also said he will be
instructing Public Safety offi-
cers to be particularly alert to
incidents where a panhandler
uses intimidation or harass-
ment to obtain a handout.

According to the letter, “All
of them should be considered
at least potentially dangerous
on the basis of their criminal
records and lifestyle.”

After last night’s Student
Government Board meeting,
safety chair Pat Catena
acknowledged that SGB had
received a copy of the letter.

“The Department of Public
Safety has taken a bold initia-
tive in attempting to remove
the panhandlers from the
Oakland streets scene,” said
Catena.

“Furthermore, they have
assured me that no one’s con-
stitutional rights will be violat-
ed for any reason.”

Catena said SGB will
attempt to educate the students
on the panhandlers, possibly
through an open letter to the
campus community.

“We don’t want to tell the
students not to give, we just
want to inform the students of
the arrests and of the citations
these panhandlers have, and
that they do have homes,” said
Catena.

The SGB will take a more
definite position on the situa-
tion in the next few days,
Catena said.

Sexual assault on campus

A 19-year-old woman was allegedly sexually assaulted at a
Pitt fraternity party last month. This occurrence directly rais-
es a number of questions involving alcohol, fraternities and
personal responsibility.

The alleged story is that the woman, after consenting to
have sex with one individual, was assaulted by a group of
males who fondled her breasts and genitalia and rubbed their
penises against her body.

Reportedly, there was also drinking involved at this party,
which, of course, complicates the issue. It is easy to condemn
individuals participating in a sexual assault — and they
deserve our fullest condemnation — but there are inherent
risks involved in the excessive intake of alcohol in any set-
ting.

Whether it leads to sexual assault or a host of other poten-
tial problems (such as mouthing off to the wrong person or
drunk driving), you are putting yourself in a potentially
unsafe situation and can easily lose control of the situation. .

The Pitt News is not trying to play the role of teetotaler and
condemn the “evils of alcohol.” However there are inherent
risks involved in alcoholic consumption, and people have to
be responsible for the consequences of their actions while
inebriated, even if they were not a “rational actor” while
committing those actions.

Moving back to the specifics of the present situation, there
were three fraternities involved in the case. The party took
place at Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI) house, but was a joint party
with Delta Tau Delta and Sigma Chi. The Department of
Public Safety reports the fraternities have been less than
cooperative.

If the reported allegations occurred, it is hardly surprising
the fraternities are not cooperating with the investigation.
Few of us would freely admit to doing something so heinous
and face the resulting consequences. However if the frats did
nothing wrong, as FIJI president ‘Chris Nolan said at the
Panhellenic Association meeting, than their lack of coopera-
tion makes less sense.

The Pitt News also imagines a conflict must be going on in
some fraternities’ members’ minds, if the allegation is true.
Those who did not participate in the assault, but know about
it, as some most likely do if the allegation is true, must be in
a moral dilemma now.

Can you with good conscience call someone brother who
could commit such an act? Granted the peer pressure will
be intense to the extreme, but a real man would come forth
and say what he knows.

There comes a time when we are all called on to be count-
ed. Most moral crimes, throughout the” history of humanity,
either continue or go unpunished through someone’s silence.
Let us hope this will not be another example.

The Pitt News strongly urges anyone who has any knowl-
edge of this event to contact Rick Boyd, head of the
Department of Public Safety.

Apropos of the report “Sexual assault
allegations reported” in The Pitt News (Oct.
17), I would like to comment that a gross
description of the sexual assault on the vic-
tim of the crime, as it appeared in the sec-
ond sentence of paragraph three of the
report, is not in conformity with the practice
of journalistic decency. Newspaper reports

Assault description is in bad taste

containing coarse details of sexual assault
crimes do not, in any way, serve to protect
the dignity of the unfortunate victims of
such crimes.

Frat sexual assault
offense not alarming

After reading of the alleged assault of a 19-
year—old university woman, I must admit I was
not alarmed. Infuriated, but not alarmed. Well-
publicized statistics reveal the prevalence of
sexual misconduct among college fraternities.

During my college experience I attended a
handful of fraternity parties. It did not take
long for me, and those I attended with, to real-
ize the mind-set among the fraternity members
and pledges. Allowing for some exceptions,
the general tone was one of alcohol—induced
bravado, testosterone and inﬂated egos desper-
ately seeking validation. I do not assert that all
fraternity members are at the mercy of their
hormones, or that they share a universal desire
to exploit and injure women. I do, however,
read the newspapers, listen to the nightly news
and hear women and men speak out on this
dilemma. a

While realizing there are no easy answers to
the complex societal issue of sexual assault, I
would like recognition and accountability from
the male members of these supposedly philan-
thropic organizations. This issue should not be
one which divides the women and men of a
campus community, but rather one that calls
action to all those who possess intelligence
and a conscience. If only the fraternities could
remember, while in the throes of male-bond-
ing, that these women they violate are their
sisters, mothers and girlfriends.

United States has
bully Foreign policy

In your Oct. 12 editorial, “Iraq is back,” you
state that “it is time for the United States to
formulate a consistent foreign policy stance
...” In fact, the United States does have a con-
sistent foreign policy stance.

It’s not a good one, but it has been consis-
tent. President Bush enunciated it best when
he said of Iraq, “We’re going to kick their ass.”
The question is to ask in the post-Cold
War era, whenever a country violates “justice,
human rights, freedom and democracy” (or
sends too many fugitives our way), can we
kick their ass?

Iraq? You bet, did it before. Haiti? No prob-
lem. China? Well, uh  let’s give them Most
Favored Nation trading status. We
don t want to isolate them (the way we’ve
isolated Iraq, Haiti, Cuba). North Korea?
Well, uh  so what if they build a few
nuclear bombs? We don’t want to isolate them
either.

The problem with the “Can we kick their
ass? policy is that it reduces the United States
to the role. of a bully. The Pitt News seems to
endorse this role.

.Wlth Rambo-tough prose, The Pitt News
said Saddam should be removed “by
any means necessary.” (Nuke him!?) The Pitt
News editorial board, insulated in its William
Pitt Union offices, seems a bit cocky.
American might is rarely a solution.

Nowlin takes a close look at religion and abortion

ere you surprised when
ex—Presbyterian minister
Paul Hill shot an abortion-

Fla., a few months ago? I wasn’t -

 years that it would only be a matter
A of time before anti-abortionists

Nowlin hands. Mainstream anti-abortion

groups will tell you that the crazies
are only a tiny minority, do not‘ represent their
movement and should not be considered

do after conversion. It’s notuncommon for people to
give testimonies to “feeling the spirit of God at work
as we stood for human life” -— all well and good,
but only to a point. In such an environment, often
spiritual commitment and political commitment go
hand-in-hand —— and that can be idolatrous.

But because legal means have not significantly
decreased the rate of abortions, some groups
have felt the need to go above the law. Enter
Operation Rescue and similar organizations whose
demonstrated contempt for nearly anyone who
doesn’t share their beliefs has resulted in a large

kind of atmosphere, the morality of abortion quickly
becomes irrelevant.

Furthermore, very rarely has abortion been a
major campaign issue — two years ago, a surprising
number of Clinton supporters philosophically
opposed abortion.

Another problem with their rhetoric is that it ﬂies
in the face of reality. Anti-abortionists have general-
ly tried to link abortion with Godlessness and moral
degeneracy when the facts suggest otherwise.

For example, it is far more difficult to get an
abortion in most of Europe than in the United States,
yet Europe generally is far more secu-

as part of it.

I take issue with that notion, because
we have seen for some time now an
overspiritualization of the abortion issue
- that is, since God opposes abortion (a
view I share), anything that stands in
opposition to abortion is necessarily
good. Although the right—to-life groups,
many of them religiously oriented, dis-
avow any intention to harm, people have
been maligned, threatened and now
even killed in the name of “pro-life.”

The reality is that, because of the way
they approach the issue, they helped to
create those conditions. That’s why I
have consistently refused to get

abortion, and also why I almost never use the term
“pro-life.”

Here is the problem: Many anti-abortionists feel
that legal abortion is to blame for many of the. social
ills that plague this country, suggesting that if we
would respect the “sanctity of human life” by out-
lawing abortion, that these issues would suddenly
clear up. Sorry, but that notion is quite na'1've at best.

The seeds of our problems were sowed long
before Roe v. Wade in 1973 and aren’t going to
change even if that Supreme Court decision is over-
turned (something that, at this point, doesn’t seem
likely).

Not surprisingly, in evangelical churches, new
believers are often recruited to take part in demon-

Their campaign is so bothersome primarily
because they are winning few friends. Effective
campaigning for social issues has always had at its
heart building relationships with others and even
includes r eaching out to adversaries, some-

It’s one thing to want to take a stand against what
one may see as evil and another entirely to have a

because it has become more important than God

Third party for governor

This week I have seen many
buildings on campus“ defaced with
such slogans as “queer pride” and
“I’m gay and I’m your roommate.”
I believe that this is nothing but
pure vandalism, and it is complete-
ly inappropriate for the university
to tolerate such nonsense.

Even though these acts of vandal-
ism may have beencommitted in
the interests of diversity and toler-
ance, that does not excuse the
defacing of buildings in which we
live and work. _

Evidently, the message we were
supposed to glean from this graffiti
is that a significant number of gays
are present in the student body
whether we like it or not. Fine.

I think that the majority of Pitt
students do not have a problem
with what these people do in their
private lives, and yes, sex is still a
private matter in our society.

But why do they have to ﬂaunt
their sexuality in our faces like

this? I certainly don’t want to hear
about it. After gaining acceptance
of their lifestyle, they push. for
more.

This graffiti scrawled upon our
buildings, whose message could
have been effectively communicat-
ed with posters, handouts or other
legal_ means, was clearly intended
to provoke, inﬂame and annoy the
rest of the student body. .

Why? Are we supposed to be
impressed?

I am certainly proud of my het-
erosexual exploits, few they may
be, but I don’t go around telling
strangers about them.

Such material is better suited for
bathroom walls, rather than the
outer surface of a public building. I
hope the university will catch and
punish the vandals responsible for
this crime.

QB throws
with poetic
prose

old
shoe.

  

Back
in late August,
everybody was
pretty satisﬁed
when Johnny
Majors named
junior college
transfer Sean
Fitzgerald his starting quarterback
to begin the 1994 season.

To Pitt fans, Fitzgerald’s imple-
mentation into the starting'QB
role embodied the rebuilding Pitt
football program.

“Better skilled QB, better foot-
ball team,” they said.

“Let’s put John Ryan and the
1993 debacle behind us,” they
said. “Go Fitz!”

But after starting 1-5, and trail-
ing 24-6 midway through the sec-
ond quarter of Saturday’s West
Virginia game, Majors had seen
enough of the ineffective
Fitzgerald.

Enter Ryan, heretofore the inef-
fective Pitt QB.

His ﬁrst play: an interception
return for a touchdown.

‘‘He’s still an ineffective Pitt
QB,”,ftlfiey said.

But’ soft, what man‘ on yonder
turf breaks? It is a new John Ryan
and we are impressed. ’

Four hundred thirty-three yards
and four touchdowns passing.

A quarterback able to toss his
mistake aside and take charge of a
ﬁve wide receiver set behind an
offensive line suspect in its pro-
tection of their passer.

He looked at home in that wide
open offense, amassing in two
and a half quarters over a third of
the 1,284 passing yards he threw
for while starting 10 games in
1993. J

Ryan did exactly what they
thought he couldn’t do and exact-
ly what they thought Fitzgerald
could.

He threw.

Not only that, he threw to the
right target.

Lost in a mass of harmless
Fitzgerald to Billy Davis comple-
tions, Dietrich Jells’ record-break-
ing and garne-breaking skills had
becorrie cobwebbed this season.

That was until Ryan remem-
bered Pitt’s single-season recep-
tions and receiving yards leader.

Jells handled ﬁve of Ryan’s 20
completions for 225 yards and
two touchdowns.

His three interceptions be
damned, Ryan would have been a
hero in the vein of Doug Flutie
had Pitt won.

Instead, he’ll have to settle
behind John Congerrii on Pitt’s
single—garne passing record list,
446 to 433. "

But heroes be damned, remem-
ber the man for his mettle.

LB Tumulty injured,

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor

Pitt head football coach
Johnny Majors confirmed the
inevitable and announced
painful news at yesterday’s press
conference.

Quarterback John Ryan will
start next week against Virginia
Tech, and linebacker Tom
Tumulty injured his knee and is
out indeﬁnitely.

Ryan did more than impress
the coaches last week when he
checked in for starter Sean
Fitzgerald midway through the
second quarter. Ryan threw for
433 yards and four touchdowns,
but also tossed three intercep-
tions.

“John Ryan earned an oppor-
tunity to start,” Majors said. “He
showed a lot of gutty play.
Besides a few glaring mistakes,
he played quite well.”

Besides Fitzgerald’s obvious
ineffectiveness in moving the
offense, Majors attributed the
switch to a change in the tempo.

Ryan, a straight drop-back
QB, is more adept to run the
five-receiver set that Pitt
switched to last weekend, than
Fitzgerald, who is more of a
scrambler.

The change also signiﬁes the
rekindling quarterback contro-
versy that ensued before sea-
son’s start _

Tennis ends fall season with loss to Bucknell

 

By Vicki Geubtner
Staﬂ Writer

The Pitt women’s tennis team
wrapped up the fall segment of
its season with a 7-2 loss to
Bucknell on Saturday, finishing
with a winning record of 6-5.

Senior captain Tammy
Keister was the only winner for
Pitt in singles, capturing her

match 2-6, 7-5, 6-1.

After winning the second set,
Keister’s confidence was boost-
ed.

“All I thought was go full
force,” Keister said. “I figured,
‘what do I have to lose?”’

Keister moved down a posi-
tion to No. 6 singles due to her
recent difﬁculty with a sprained
wrist. Coach George
Dieffenbach felt the switch,
“was a better opportunity to
win and play with less pain.”

Keister continued winning as
she combined with Alison
Baker in their doubles match
for a 7-6, 5-7, 7-6 victory.

There was some concern
before the match regarding
Baker, who sprained her ankle
in the first game of the second
set of her singles game, about
how well she would compete.

“Alison said she wasn’t
going to be able to move as fast
into the net,” Keister said.
Despite her soreness, Baker
pulled off the win with “her
lobs,” Keister said.

lem at the moment is not who’s
going to be the starting play
caller —— it’s who is going to ﬁll
the defensive gap.

Tumulty added to the
Panthers’ long list of injuries,
after he left the West Virginia
game early in the first quarter

“It was hard to move for-
ward,” Baker said.

Baker strategically set up
some back shot plays to relieve
herself, “giving Tammy the
chance to put the ball away on
the last shot,” she said.

Due to the sprain in singles,
Baker felt the match might
have been closer, but not neces-
sarily a different outcome.

“I lost my concentration after
the sprain,” Baker said. “I
stepped lightly.”

Dieffenbach said the injury
“definitely had an impact on
her mobility.” He added it
didn’t take anything away from
Bucknell’s Julia Diaz, as she
played an experienced and
competitive match.

Fran Davis suffered her first
singles defeat of the season,
losing 6-2, 6-3 to Bucknell’s
Kristina Lutter.

“Fran could never really
damage her,” Dieffenbach said.
“Lutter had an answer for every
ball Fran hit.”

Dieffenbach said that Lutter
was probably the best player
Davis played all year.

Despite the loss for the team,
Dieffenbach remained pleased
with the women’s overall sea-
son performance.

“We beat some teams who
beat us last year and won some
close matches,” Dieffenbach
said.

“It’s been a successful season

with a knee injury.

“We don’t think Tom will play
this week,” Majors said. “He’s
out for an indeﬁnite period.”

Majors said Tumulty injured
his knee on a “glancing blow.”

“It’s a very sizable loss to any
football team,” Majors said.

Pitt finally gained the
momentum when Tom

record to 4-2.

Fortin said.

The B-squad earned the
Panthers a split with IUP.

The B-squad won 13-5. This
was their first victory since
California University of
Pennsylvania had to forfeit
their matches against Pitt.

Pitt’s regular season finale
comes Saturday against the
University of Pennsylvania.

The match will mark the
rugby c1ub’s fourth straight
road game.

“We’re really getting tired
of travelling, but hopefully
we’ll pull out a victory on
Saturday,” Fortin said.

The loss against IUP put a
damper on Pitt’s chances of
advancing to the postseason

“She ran three or four seconds
faster than last year,” Schwartz
said. “She did break the record,
but the girl from Bucknell beat
her.”

Beaten by ﬁve seconds, Martin
ran well, according to Schwartz.

“The course was rugged and
very hilly. Angie went out fast
like she usually does,” Schwartz
said. “She’s more of a ﬂat runner,
but she was exception .”

Along with Martin's perfor-
mance, two other athletes caught
Schwartz’s attention at the Red
Flash Invitational.

The fourth-place finish of
freshman Amy Francy (21:14)
helped secure the second-place
finish for the Panthers.

“Amy ran very well. She did a
good job,” Schwartz said.

surprised at how well I did. It
was a very hilly course, and I
hadn’t expected to do that well.”

Another display of the improv-
ing time and ability can be found
in the performance of Melanie
Ishman.

“Melanie Ishman came up and
did well in this meet,” Schwartz
said. “She got nosed out right
there at the wire by five tenths of
a second.” I

With her eighth-place finish at
21:38.5, Ishman was fourth
among the Pitt women, behind
Stacey Ellsworth who came in
sixth with a time of 21:24.

The maturation of the fresh-
man runners as well as the steady
improvement of the team as a
whole has peaked just in time for

the cross-country Big East
Championships in Boston, on
Oct. 29.

Schwartz looks for his
women’s team to move up this
year and challenge other teams at
the meet.

“I think we are going to do
better as far as the performances
and the places of the individuals,”
Schwartz said.”

It is the climb each week in the

V The Pitt News, Tuesday, October 18, 1994

standings and in the individual
times that give Schwartz such
hope.

“I think we are doing better
than they did last year, but proba-
bly because everyone else
improved,” Schwartz said. “But
we really won’t know until we
run the race in Boston.”

The men’s team has been con-
sistent this year, and its steadying
force has been senior Mike
Umbleby.

Umbleby shattered the course
record by one minute and 11 sec-
onds with a finishing time of
26.00.

“He was running with these
two guys from Bucknell,”
Schwartz said. “He made these
two little moves that they cov-
ered, and then he made a big
move and they couldn’t catch
him.”

The men followed Bucknell in
the standings with a score of 40

points.
Behind Umbleby and the two

runners from Bucknell were fol-
lowed by Dennis Kuntz, who fin-
ished with a time of 26:58.

Ed Adamson came in eighth
place with a time of 27:33, trail-
ing three runners from Bucknell.

It was the men’s first running
experience at this invitational.

Both teams have a week off
before competing in the Big East
Championships.

Midwest tournament, held at
Bowling Green University in

Ohio.

Pitt, which was in second
place in the Midwest region
before losing, needs to come
up with a victory against
Penn.

A second place finish
would give Pitt a chance of
being selected for the touma-
ment.
