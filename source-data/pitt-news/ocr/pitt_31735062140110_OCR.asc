'11,

Last year a student senate was estab-
lished in the University, and while it
did not do all that was promised for it,
there was certainly a great deal of bene-
ﬁt derived from the plan. The men who
were elected to ﬁll the position of sena-
torewere by the very nature of things
new to to their duties and as a result
the machinery did not move with the
precision’ it should have, had the or-
ganization been favored with more
maturity ‘in years. There were times
when the students were inclined to
censure the action of the men on the
senate, but as a whole the work was
done in a spirit of faithfulness’ that

"cannot be disputed. The most hopeful

aspect of the year’s work was the
prospects and outcome for the current
college year, but already the year is ad-
vancing fast as little actual good has
been accomplished by the senate beyond
election and a general discussion of the
constitution at thebeginning of the
term, otherwise the senate has been con-
from student
activities in-the University. This is a

condition that should not exist in the in-

stitution at this time.

The difficulty this term seems to lie in
the fact that, the constitution arranged
for the senate is at t-he present time too
complex to bring the proper" results.
Every school and department in the Uni-
versity is by the new plan to have equal

‘ representation in the senate; this. is in

itself perfectly proper, but the size of
some of the schools is such. that a bare
majority for the desired representation
is all that can be attained. Thus, it is,
two schools, whose work is similar to a
certain extent, are burdened with too
many senators to the detriment of both.
There is a need ‘for a senate just now

and it is hoped that the men who are’
elected to ﬁll the positions by the var-_-~

ious classes will realize their responsi_

'bility in the matter and get to work as

soon as possible. The merit of the
senate can not be denied by the stu-
dents because it is primarily a student
organization, with but one real purpose,
and that i.s the desire to aid the cause of
the student all the time. A
Theconstitution made for the senate
may be all right for the greater Univer-
sity, but just now t-he essential parts of
the document could be observed, which
would permit of the gradual working
over of the ways of the former years.
The Vi/eekly is not at‘ all desirous of
criticizing the senate or the senators, but
it seems to us that they ought to be at

coming up daily for attention at the
hands of the students. The calibre of
the men elected to the senate is such
that a large amount of work should be

' done by the organization this year, but a

A LESSON OF THE STATE.

Trh University offers courses in politi-
cal science in various forms, but the
lesson, which this State taught to the
rising generation last week is notgained
in text books or in the halls of the col‘-
leges and the Universities of the ‘com-
monwealth. Pennsylvania, the grand
old state of the original thirteen, found-
ed by the illustrious .William Penn, with
a hope and a future that was not
equaled by any of the young states away
back in the history of this nation! To-
day that state is the cynosure of all
eyes, because she stands besmirched and
tainted with machine politics. .Last
week the death knell of corruption was
sounded in many of the states, but poor
old Pennsylvania was not strong enough
to throw off the fangs and the poison
of the men who.essay to be her poli-
ticians. The Keystone State is wallow-
ing and grovelling in the darkness of
political impurity; the people are not
sovereign, but dark vale of the machine
is supreme in the land.

True, that sounds a little like a
political organ, but all the more true, it
is fact; we are only students, not ac-
cording to the way of the world, cap-
able of expressing mature opinions but,
most certainly all of us noticed the re-
sult in our state last week. Our politi-
cal faith may differ, but no, well mean-
ing man can overlook the fact, that the
t8:C'£lCS used last week are’ far from
right, no matter whatlthe end may be.

THE FRESHMEN CAP.‘

It has been the custom at the Uni-
versity to require the Freshmen to wear,
the sign of their newness in the form
of a green cap. The idea is not by any
means original with the University of
Pittsburgh. but, one which is_ in evi-
dence in the leading colleges and Uni-
versities of the country. There is
nothing humiliating in the wearing of
thegreen, but, rather’ it is one of the
many features of American college life.
It seems to us that the Sophomores of
this institution have grown lax in their
method by the size of the Freshmen
cowed by the size -of the Freshmen
class. Surely the Fresh. are not wear-
ing their caps as they have done in
former years. Of course the custom is
not one which the faculty would risk
their reputations to authorize, but never-
thelessthey are insympathy with the
healthy student fads and at all times
glad to promote, by their support such
affairs as keep the University on a par
with the other centers of learning in the
country. VVhy not show your spirit,
Sophs. and make those caps stay on the
beads of the Fresh. a little better than
they have been doing? It is not neces-
sary to get ugly about_it, either, for the
.Freshmen will be glad to obey, if the
proper nfethod is taken to get the de-
sired results. .

At most_of the colleges the Freshmen
are compelled to wear the green for the
entire academic year, but here it is

ought to be an easy matter to enforce
lthe rule. that length of time. The
Eclasses in former years have done,
lbetter than the present Sophs, but
there is still hope!

' Quarters.

‘The Medical students are starting
to move their new building today,
after a great many delays and post-
ponements. The Freshmen and Sopho-
mores will have dissecting in the new
building by next Monday, but will
continue to take chemistry in- the
Pharmacy building. All other classes
but chemistry and histoloov will be
held in the new location. _

With the Medicals on the campus,
the school will begin to take on a
still livelier appearance, and a great

‘impetus to student activities in gen-

eral, may be anticipated.

ROADWAY TO BE BUILT.

Work is at Last Started on the Road-
‘ way Which Will Extend to
~ Pennsylvania Hall.

The excavation for the new road-'
way, which will extend from the Uni-
versity campus to the top of Univers_
ity hill, was started last week and it
is likely the work will be rushed rap-
idly to completion. The thoroughfare
will be of the very best construction
of its kind and will be an added fea-
ture to the University campus, which
will soon be a thing of beauty and not
the illkept affair it is now.

Sigma Chi Fraternity house. All of
the staff were present andva number
of matters of importance were dis-
cussed. It was decided to have each
editor take full charge of an issue in
his turn and thus distribute a little
more evenly,. the large amount of‘
work connected with the editing of

the paper.

. ‘Enough For All-American

Walter Camp Said To Have Been Invited Here for An-

It has been persistently rumored,
within the last week, that Walter

Day, with no other purpose in view,
than watching our own “Tex” and

_ more valuable player than Jack

The following from the Pittsburgh
Dispatch is indicative of the senti-
ment displayed by the city sporting
unites:

There is no doubt in the minds of
the Pitt team’s followers that these
two sterling players could make po-
sitions on any team in the country.
Their work- this season is all and
more than could be desired. ‘_ As a
leader and a player, “Tex” Richards
would set the football world on ﬁre
this season if he was playing on one
of the big Eastern college elevens,
where his work would be observed
by the so—called “big guns” ingridiron
circles.

It is doubtful if Richards’ equal has
ever been seen in this part of the
State as a ground gainer. Having
mastered the use of the “straight
arm’? this big, good-natured, 200-
pounder, is able to. plunge the line
and work his way through a broken
ﬁeld as few other football players
have ever done, and if Pittsburg has
ever produced an All-American player
then Richards is the man. As a
leader, Richards is-popular with the
men on the team and seems to be able

- to get more Work out of his" team

mates than the majority of captains
have previously.

Until this season Pitt has been woe-
fully weak in the kicking depart-
ment——that is, the team has never had
what was considered a reliable man to
negotiate goals from ﬁeld. It is dif-
ferent now, as in “Polly’ Galvin they
have one of the most accurate pig-
skin booters in the game. He has
demonstrated his worth as an extra
point gainer by kicking goals after
touchdowns, and during the present
season has missed but few. No mat-
ter-_whether the angle is a difficult
one, the leather goes over just the
same.

On the defense he is a tower of
strength. Time after time he h'as
been seen to break through his op-
p:onent’s line, grab the man with the
ball and simply lay him on the
ground. He seems to take a delight
at times in showing how easily he can

. handle his man, but when he knows

his team is up against a hard propo-
sition, he is anything but an “easy"
player. As a center he is a much
urn-
er, whom many persons considered an
All-American candidate. while his
ability to boot the ball puts his stock
much higher than the old gold and
blue favorite.

Next to Richards and Galvin. De-
war and Lindsay must be considered.
These two players cannot be over-
looked when it comes to honorable
mention. although it is a hard matter
not to name every man on the team as
a star of the gilt-edged brand. There
is not a player. on the Pitt team that
has made more long runs in a broken
ﬁeld this season than “Tillie” Dewar.
He has made so many that the fans

l Rudolph Munk, Captain of West
Virginia Meets Death on Grid-
iron. ‘

 

Rudolph Munk, star player on the
University of West Virginia football
team was killed during the progress
of the game with Bethany at Wheel-'
ing last Saturday. Relative_- to the
sad accident Coach Thompson made
the following statement:

“Munk’s- death will have absolute-
lv no effect on_ games at Pitt. While
we all regret it very much it can-

the other. Munk should never have
been allowed to play in the game at
all. I was afraid when West Vir-
ginia played us a tweek ago that
something of the kind. would happen.
Munk, while a fine fellow, a good
student and a good football -player.
was a man of small physique and
weak in the lungs. He was not the
kind of a man who should play foot-
ball at all. The Pitt team will send
a wreath of ﬂowers.” _
The University of Pittsburgh joins
with West Virginia in their bereave-
ment and distress and takes this op-
-portunity through the columns of the
Weekly to extend heartfelt sympathy.

FRESH TO HAVE TEAM.

Manager of Basketball Is Elected and
v Schedule Slated.

The Freshmen are to have a basket-
ball team this winter as is evidenced
by the plansalready formed for the
season in the election of a manager
and the start on the formation of
a schedule. The men elected as the
manager of the team is Coleman of
the Wilkinsburg High School, who
has had a great deal of experience in
the conduct of teams and will no
doubt give the Fresh a rattling good
ﬁve this winter.

As yet no place has been secured
for the practice work of the boys, but
it is expected to get the Armory for
the preliminary work, as soon the
building is ready for occupancy.

Men who have announced their in-
tention of coming out are Fushman
of Pittsburg High School, Campbell.

I Fresh Football

The ‘Freshman football team is
nearing the end of the season and
consequently the remaining games are
the more important. The teams re-
maining on theschedule are: Indiana
Normal and the Sophomores, and the
team will out forth every effort to win

been handicapp-ed all season by lack of
training, as the laboratory periods
coming in the late afternoon, have
made it impossible to get the team to-
gether for a single scrimmage prac-
tice. Other facilities have not been
lacking, for Coach Thompson had
kindly granted the use of Forbes
Field for practice with his men. and
Dr. Rugh had consented to coach the
team, for which courtesies the Fresh-

_ men are very thankful.

’ ootball Schedule, 1910

The teams played this season have
all been fast and heavy, and no at-
tempt has been made to schedule easy
teams, and the team deserves great
cr.edit for, although defeated a few
times, they were defeated by‘ ﬁrst class
teams, the strength of which can not
be disputed.

The team will comprise its fastest
and best players when it lines up
against Indiana Normal‘ and the
Sophomores, and ‘both these Contests
are sure to be fast and furious.

EXPERT To’ THE COVERN-
~ MENT.

After the panic of 1907, a Govern-
ment commission known as the Na-
tional Monetary Commission was ap-
pointed by Congress to devise a bet-
ter system of banking and currency.
The commission searched the world,
both in America and abroad, for the
best equipped experts to ‘assist in
working out their plans of reform.

Dr. J. T-. Holdsworth of this Uni-
versity was one of the half dozen
University men in this country chosen
to assist the commission, because of
their knowledge of the problems in-
volved. Dr. Holdsworth was assign-
ed the study of the First Bank of the
United States, which was the ﬁrst ex-
perience of this country with a cent-
ral national bank, His report on this
subject has recently appeared under
authority of the National Monetary
Commission. He also read a paper on
“State Banking before the Civil War,”
before the Academy of Political
Science of New York, which at its
meeting last week considered -the
whole question of the findings of the
-commission and proposals for reform.
This meeting is to be addressed by
Senator Aldrich, Chairman of the
Commission and by Honorable A. P.
Andrew, Assistant Secretary of the
Treasurer. ‘ ‘ ‘

Sophs Suspended

Entire .Class at Westminster
College Disciplined.

-. The entire sophomore class of
VVestminster college, at New .Wil—
mington, was suspended for two
weeks by the college faculty. while
one member, Lloyd Jameson, of Oak-
dale, was expelled, resulting from the
sticking of posters ridiculing the
freshmen class, all over the college
buildings and over various buildings
about town.

It was decided that the sophomores
could escape suspension by paying the
damages, $38 in all. The sophomores
refused to pay.-

Appropos of the above statement
the following is of interest: ‘

Rev. Dr. R. M. Russell, president
of Westminster College, said the pub-
lished report that the sophomoreclass
had been suspended for refusal to set-
tle damages resulting from .a college
prank is untrue. The sophomores had
struck posters, ridiculing the freshmen,
about the college buildings. The fac-
ultv demanded that the damage. ﬁxed
at $12, be paid for. Dr. Russell said
the sophomores had agreed to pay the
amount and that the incident is closed.

The statement that .Lloyd Jamison
of Oakdale. a sophomore, had been
expelled for participating in the
prank, Dr.sRussell said was without
foundation-. no such action having
been contemplated.

THE. PITT WEEKLY,

Conference of Colleges

and Secondary Schools

Meets Here

New Movement of the University of Pittsburgh in the Interests
of Education in Western Pennsylvania.

On Friday_and Saturday, December

'2 and 3, there will be held in Thaw
.Hall, University of Pittsburgh, the

First Annual Conference of the Col-
leges and Secondary Schools of West-
ern Pennsylvania. Ever since the re-
organization of the University was

undertaken, six years ago, under the

direction of Chancellor McCormick,
the plan has been. uppermost in the
minds of those controlling the affairs
of the University to bring about the
organization '_of the different phases
of education in the Western part of
the State. Foremost among the pro-
posed plans was that of the organiza-
tion of the Colleges and Secondary
Schools. Now that the different
Schools of the University have taken
deﬁnite form, the time seems ripe for
carrying some of the projected plans
into operation.

During the last week invitations
were sent out from the ofﬁce of the
University to all the College Presi-
dents of Western Pennsylvania, to
the State Superintendents and to the
high school principals of one hundred
forty-seven school svstems, West of
the mountains, and to twenty—one
County Superintendents. The invita-
tion explains the purpose of the Con--
ference in the following words. “The
interests of higher and secondary ed-
ucation" in Western Pennsylvania
seem to demand a closer co-operation
and stronger sympathy among the re-
spective institutions of the region.
There is no ‘better means of serving
this purpose than an annual confer-
ence for the discussion of questions
of mutual interest. Located at the
center of population and iniclose
proximity to the various institutions
for the promotion of art, science and
industry in the region, the University
of Pittsburgh feels prompted to issue
the call for the initial meeting.”

The programs arranged for the
Conference are prophetic of meetings
of unusual interests. The ﬁrst ses-
sion on Friday morning, will be de-

. voted to addresses of welcome by the

Chancellor of the University, and one
of the Deans, and to responses by
several of the guests. The afternoon
session of Friday, will be devoted to
the consideration of the effect of the
proposed school code of Pennsylvania
upon the College interestsand upon
the welfare of the High Schools. The
Friday evening session will consider
the topic “Can the High School Effec-
tively Combine Vocational Training
and Preparation for College?” The
fourth session will convene Saturday
morning and will be devoted to papers
on the topics, “How may. the College

Strengthen the Secondary Schools.”-
-and “How may Secondary Schools

Improve the College.”

Ample time has been allowed on all
programs for general discussion and
the assigned papers have been distrib-
uted equally among the representa-
tives of the Colleges and Secondary
Schools. Luncheon will be served at
the University at noon, on each day

i of the Conferenc-e and the out of _town

visitors will be guests over night of
the trustees. professors and friends of
the University. A number of accept-
ances have alreadv been received and
there is every reason to believe that
the meetings of the Conference will
be largely attended by out of town
educators. It is equally. certain that
the attendance, from the immediate

community will be large.

The Classical Association of_West-
ern Pennsylvania will hold its month-
lv meeting, in connection with the
Conference, Saturday afternoon hav-
ing been set aside for its program.
The _Pennsylvania‘ Schoolmaster’s
Club has. also arranged its ﬁrst ban-
quet for Saturday afternoon, so-that
its members coming from out of town
will have an opportunity to a.ttend the
meetings of the Conference as well as
the ﬁrst meeting of the Club for the
year. _

In view of the possible adoption
of a school code for Pennsylvania by

the coming legislature and of the.

numerous other evidence of an edu-
cational awakening in the State, the
current school year promises to be
one ofunusual interest and import-
ance. This Conference of Colleges
and Secondary Schools, should serve
the purpose of making clear the
special problems of education in this
ﬁeld and should do much toward the
crystallization of sentiment and the
to-ordination of effective plans for
the realization of the newest and best
ideals of higher education.

PITT IS BARRED.

“The Dispatch is authorized to state

that the Penn Stars are ready to ar-
range football games with all teams
which do not average more than 20
pounds per man. The Penn Stars
have their being in the Lawrenceville
district and it is stipulated that a
game with the Pitt team is not desir-.
able.
“The challenge. containing this in-
formation percolated into The Dis-
patch' ofﬁce last night. It reads as
follows: .

“ ‘The Penn Stars would like to ar-
range games with 20-pound teams.
We won’t play Pitt. Address Cole-
man Harrison, 4921 Butler street, or
call l94-L Fisk, between 6 and.

. In.’ 9)

The above, clipped, from the Pitts-
burg Dispitch, shows that the young-
sters have respect for the university
football team.

CADETS LOSE HOLIDAY LEAVE

All the members of the ﬁrst class of
the West Point cadets, 85 in number,
have been deprived of their Christ-
mas leave of absence as punishment
for their participation in the “silenc-
ing” of Capt. Rufus E.‘Longan, of the
Eleventh Infantry, an instructor in
military tactics, Sertember 24 last.

While the punishment order in-
cludes all of the ﬁrst class cadets who
will be graduated next June, fewer
than half the number are affected, the
rest being already debarred from en-
joying the holidav leave this Vear be-
cause of demerits marked against
them.

STATE FRESHIES WIN.

The freshmen won annual Penn
State’s football game against the
sophomores 6 to 5, an exact duplicate
of last year’s score. Johnston kicked

the goal from touchdown that won

the game after Baldwin’s touchdown
for the ﬁrst year men. McCreery
made the sophomore score, both
touchdowns resulting directly from
blocked punts. ~

‘Johnston studio.

Owl‘ Board is Busy 

Official Photographer is Elected

and Plans are Discussed at

Semi-Monthly’ Meeting Last
Friday.

The Owl board has decided,after a
careful survey _of the photographers in
the city, to give the entire contract

-to‘ Johnston, the well known artist,

who will do the work on all the parts
of the next year book. The idea of
the present board is a good one, in
thatit insures a uniformity heretofore

impossible, on account of the various-

contracts given to different men in
the city who assayed to take pictures
and then produced anything but one
when ﬁnished. Arrangements have
been made with Mr. Johnston to do
all the work, but the co-operation of
the students is necessary to make the
plan the success it should be, in that
the visits to the photographers, be
made when requested by the men in
charge of~the book._

The.edit-ors have asked the Weekly
to call the attention of thefraternities
and clubs in the University, to the
beneﬁt to be derived in going to the
Arrangements are
about concluded, ‘whereby the pictures
of the clubs and fraternities will be
given, the best possible attention and
insure a picture that will be,wel1
worth _having at any time. The one
thingthat will aid the facilities for
the work is the direction of the atten-
tion to the Johnston studio. All. the
photos of this nature will be taken at
the big studio on Fifth avenue, next
to Reymers. . f _

The contract as originally called for
means that a total of nine hundred
pictures will be taken at the Johnston
studio an_d this makes it imperative
that all the Juniors start now toward
the “picture man,” as the individual
photos must be in the hands of"the
editors not later than the ﬁfteenth
of December. These pictures will be
taken at the lower studio on Fifth
avenue, opposite the Diamond Na-
tional Bank. ‘

The regular semi-monthly meeting
of the Owl board occured last Friday
evening in Thaw Hall, with a full at-

7 tendance and a spirit that indicates

the best we have ever had in the way
of a year book. .The most important
matter which was discussed at the
meeting was the desire to have all the
men or women in the University, who
either have or think they have, artis--
tic ability to get in communication
with any of the editors and give them
an idea of their capacities. An invi-
tation has also been extended to any
one having original ideas to impart
them to the editors of the Owl, as
they are not only willing to receive.
but. anxious that the students take an
active part in the planning of the next
annuaL

Information blanks have already
been passed for the members of the
different classes and it is hoped that
they will be attended to at the earli-
est possible date. Don't wait all
week before signing the blank, but
gratify yourself by "retting at the job
at once. The Weekly has no connec-
tion with the Owl, but we are willing
to boost. I

w. AND J. MEN ARE ENTER-
TAINED3

.A number of W. and J. men, com-
rising a part of the Alpha Chapter of
hi Gamma Delta at Washington and
Jefferson, were the guests of‘ the -Phi
Zeta Phi fraternity house last Friday
evening. The entertainment was in

the nature of an informal smoker.

“Revival” Stirs up Spirit.

 

Last Friday, an enthusiastic mass

._meeting of the students of alldepai‘t- 4
ments, was held in the Chapel of_

Thaw Hall. The purpose .was, of
course, to complete all arrangements
necessary to get W. and J’s. “goat,”
and this object seems tohave been
carried out very successfully.

Coach Joe Thompson, gave one of
his customary vivid speeches, and it
may be remarked in passing that _his
abilitv to stir ‘tip school spirit and en-
thusiastic support of the team, con-
stitutes a not inconsidera-ble share of
his great success as a coach. “Joe”
was followed by “Waldy” Zieg, who
made a strong plea for a good show-
ing and good rooting at the Nixon.

Estabrook called for volunteers to
watch the gates at Forbes Field, every
day till Thanksgiving, and the Fresh,
feeling convinced that it was up to
them, responded heartily.

Afterwards the whole bunch went -

over to the ﬁeld to watch the practice
and cheer the players. - ‘

and a W. & J. man managed to re-

next play, but recovered and then

yards, and then Richards kicked. For-

THE PITT WEEKLY

the first half.

During the intermission the Pitt
students marched lockstep around the
ﬁeld and ended up by cleverly form-
ing a large P... From this position,
they cheered lustily for their Alma
Mater and ended up by giving three
times three for W. & J., just to show
there was no hard feeling. The
& J. bunch answered back with hearty
cheers and showed a wonderful spirit.
Their team was playingxa loosing
game, but they cheered only the
louder. In fact the cheering dual
was a big feature of the day. Al-
though it seemed sad (P) to hear W.
& J. singing “Taps.” They were
sounding their own death knell. ,

The beginning of the third quar-
ter found Hittner and Capt. Richards
back in the line-up. Galvin kicked
off to Wallace who was downediby
"Hittner on the ten-yard line. Blair

broke up the following play by throw-

ing Marshall for a loss. Forsythe
then kicked to Dewar, who was im-
mediately tackled by Tibbins. Rich-
ards was good for ﬁve yards through
left guard and Brown followed by a
fast run to the twenty-"seven yard line.
Richards‘ and Brown then put the
ball on the twelve-yard line. Two
more tries failed to penetrate W. &
J.’s defense, so Galvin dropped .back
and kicked a perfect goal from the
twenty—three-yard line, raising the
score to 8-0. ' ‘

Forsythe kicked off to Brown, who-
fumbled but Dewar recovered, and on
the A next ~play dashed off eight-
een yards around right and Rich-
ards added two more and then
kicked to Forsythe who signaled for
a. free catch. to save himself from
being tackled. Wallace made two
yards bv a long end run, and Forsythe
punted to Dewar. Hittner failed to
get around left end, so Richards made
a quick" kick to Whitehill who was
downed by Dewar. Whitehill then
tried to buck through center but he
bounced off Galvin like a rubber ball.
An exchange of punts followed which
aided by a penalty for offside, land-
ed the ball on Pitts’ forty-two-yard
line. W. & J. then attempted a for-
ward pass with a neculiar formation
in which the line was scattered half
way across the ﬁeld. Blair, however,
grabbed Forsythe "before he could
throw the ball, making a loss of lif-
teen yards. Ingham punted-to Hitt-
ner, who returned the ball to the 40-
yard line. Here Forsythe and Bailey
got into an unfriendly squabble which
ended in both being benched. Grimm
was sent in for Forsythe and Gehlert
for Bailey. _ ,

“Tillie” Dewar again got away for
a 10-yard gain and Richards followed
suit by adding as many more. Dewar
and H_ittner then made another first
down in two tries. Quickly follow-
ing were two more ﬁrst downs nego-
tiated by Brown, Richards and Hitt-
ner, and before any one realized it
the ball was on the nine-yard line.
Galvin again stepped back to kick a
ﬁeld goal but the ball refused to go
between the posts. W. &_J. put the
ball in scrimmage on the twenty-ﬁve
yard line but just then ‘the whistle
blew for the close of the third quarter.

At the start of the fourth period
Ingham punted, but the ball went al-
most straight up in the air and came
down in the waiting arms of “Polly”
Galvin. Richards and Brown made
ﬁve yards in two tries and then Gal-
vin tried another placement goal from
the 30-yard line. Again he failed and
the ball fell into Marsha’ll’s arms and
he started down theﬁeld fulltilt. Gal-
vin. however. nabbed him before he
got far. Wagner was substituted at
this point.\‘for,-Lindsay and Quailey
went in for Brown. Two exchanges
of puntsilanded the ball on W. & J’s.
twelve-yard line.’ Wallace pmad-e a

nice run “of eight yards and then.
the”
thirty-two—yard line. Hittnferf'_gcoul‘d.

Ingham kicked Budd’ ’ on

to’

 

make no gain, but Budd found an
opening for ten yards. Hittner then
redeemed himself by making a won-
derful seven-yard run through a
broken, ﬁeld‘. Butler was here sub-
stituted for Peacock. Richards tried
a forward pass to VVagner, but it fell
short and was of course brought back.

W. A quick kick sent the ball outside at

the ten-yard line and when Wallace
failed to get around left end, Ingham
punted to Stevenson, who fumbled the
ball and Tibbins recovered it and
started down the ﬁeld, only to be
ilowned by Galvin, onzthe twenty—yard
llle. '

After this play Wallace was put
out of the game for rough work and
Moody took his place. Incidentally,
W. & J. drew a. ten-yard penalty. _On
Pitt’s left end Reed was substituted
for Butler. Stevenson broke through
the line and blocked Ing.ham’s punt.
which was recovered by the Red and
Black on their one-yard line. Ing-
ham'again booted the ball, this time
Budd landingqit on the twenty—yard
line. A forwardapass now worked to
perfection, Richards to Budd and on

the next play Galvin opened a hole

through which Richards went for a
touchdown. Richards kicked out to
Hittner, who made a ﬁne catch and
Galvin easily kicked the goal, making
the score l4'—0.

After this the “horse laugh?’ was

.often heard from the east stand, while
the Red and Black section was rather

gloomy. An exchange of punts ﬁn-
ished thegame and when the ref-
eree’s whistle blewthe ball was in
W. & J’s. territory. Another defeat
had gone down in history for W. &
]J?.' and a much deserved victory for

Good Offensive A Work Shown
Saturday.

A detailed account of the game
shows‘that Pitt carried the ball from
scrimmage just 326 yards, while W
& J. gained 21 yards and was thrown
for a total of 28 yards loss, giving
them a total of minus 7 yards. The
comparison of W. & J.’s gain and
loss gives a good idea of »Pitt’s de-
fense. ’

While every member _of the team
gave splendid interference to the
player'carrying the ball, it is interest-
ing_ to note the men who gained from

Capt. Richard’s Statement.
“Of course, I am glad we won, but

missed my guess of three touch-

downs. The slippery condition of the
gridiron prevented at least two more
tallies. W. & J. played hard, as we
expected them to. The fact that we
did not have to use any of the plays
we have been practicing for
Thanksgiving game was pleasing-—we
won by means of straight football.“

Thor'npson’s, Statement.

“There is no doubt about the bet-
ter team winning. The only thing
I disliked about the whole game was
the killing of time by our opponents.
I am very glad we wpereable to win
by meansof straight football, as we
have a number of plays up our sleeves
which we hoped we would not be
forced to use before the State game.
Coach Morrow is to be congratulated
for the manner in which his men ‘per-
formed. They put up just as stub-
born a resistance near the end of the
game‘ as they did at the start.” 4

THE PITT WEEKLY

Here on Thanksgiving Day.

\

The Penn State rooters are going
to come to the big game on Thanks-
giving Day to do or die, according to
the plans outlined by the current is-
sue of the Collegian, the official organ
of the institution.

The article, which is given in full
below indicates that at least one
thousands students are being exhorted
to attend the game. It is said that a
special fare on the railroad is being
sought and if successful the men will
invade the Smoky city determined to
show the spirit of Old State.
as we are concerned, themore the
merrier for we have an idea that
something is going to happen on the
twenty-fourth, which will make one
thousand or two thousand State root-
ers wish they were back in Center
County. As a matter of fact, the large
delegation of State men would be a
splendid thing for the institution and
we hope that the ‘plan. to bring the
legions of rooters, or what ever you
choose to call it, materializes. Fol-

lowing is given the item as clipped
~-from the Collegian:

ADDRESSES Y. M. C. A.

On. Monday morning, November 7,
Chancellor McCorrriic_k addressed ‘the
Young Men’s Christian Association.

_ A vital need of the University is a

student building on- theicampus. To get
the Association, as well as the stu-
dent ‘body interested in. securing such
a building, was the purpose -of the
Chancellor’s address. .

We are beginning to realize the
beneﬁt we might derive from such
a building, and as the University con-
tinues to grow the need of this build-_
ing will become.-.more imperative.

Dr. McCormick said that he was
expecting the Alumni to provide f-or a
building, .and was anxious that the
students should take the responsibil-
.ity of raising a fund for the erection
of such a building as will meet the
growing demand of the student body.

In this building there shall be
special rooms for all the student
organizations. A large auditorium
for student meetings and recitals. A
din.ing hall to meet the needs of those
who are wanting a good place to
board. ‘ I ' I

This building, in fact, is to make
the student feel entirely at home.

There are a number of prominent
men in the city, whom the Chancellor
is assured will give liberally to such a
project, if only they are given the op-
portunity.

To all who heard the address there
came the feeling that the “Student
Building” will not long be a matter of
fancy. “We can do it and we will.”

Meeting of Faculty

 

Their Sanction Given the Petit-
ion F or a Holiday.

On last Friday morning. after
Chapel, a meeting of the faculty was
called, for the purpose of taking ac-.

tions on a petition for a holiday, pre— '

sented by the Senate. It was the de-
sire of the student body to have a
holiday. officially, if we were victori-
ous over W. and J. The request was
granted by the faculty. in as much, as
it was decided to have n-o work after
Chapel on Monday.

As far .

' monies.

Every fall Penn State has been
sending large delegations of students
to the big’ football games at Wilkes-
barre, Williamsport and Philadelphia,
but never in the history of our insti-
tution has State been fairly represent-
ed by the student body at the annual
game in Pittsburg. As Western
Pennsylvania furnishes the largest
proportion of men to our college, we
should remedy this matter on the oc-
casion of our big game with Pitt this
Thanksgiving Day. The people of
Pittsburg do not realize what a po'w-
erful institution we have at Penn
State, but we can easily open their
eyes by sending one thousand under-
grades to Pittsburg Thanksgiving
Day, and along with this delegation
our 400 Pittsburg Alumni will join'in
an “Old State” yell, which will fairly
raise the concrete walls of Forbes
ﬁeld from their foundations. It is the
duty of our College to give Pittsburg-
ers an idea of what Penn State really
is and arrangements should be made
with the railroad for a special train
and the matter worked out enthusias-
tically and successfully. - ,
