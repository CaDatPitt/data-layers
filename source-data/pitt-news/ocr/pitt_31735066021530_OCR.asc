Asst. News Editor

Pitt campus police officer Mathew
Kranjec wa-s suspended from the
department yesterday after being arrested
in St. Clair Village for running two stop
signs, possession of a controlled substance,
possession of drug paraphernalia and
drunken driving.

According to police reports, at
approximately 2:30 a.m. yesterday, Kranjec

was seen with another male driving to the
intersection of Cresswell and Kohne streets.

Kranjec, who was driving his grey 1987
Chevrolet Cavalier, did not stop for the

stop sign. Kranjec was not on duty.

Pittsburgh city police officers turned on
sirens, but Kranjec ﬂed in his car and
passed through a second stop sign. Kranjec
led city police on a chase for three blocks
and was ﬁnally brought to a stop. The
arresting officers, Kenneth Kuzins and
Cecil Young, described Kranjec as very

According to the report, Kranjec’s speech"

Kuzins smelled alcohol on Kranjec’s breath
and requested that he take a field—sobriety
test. Kranjec started to stumble and fall. He

was placed under arrest at 2:28 a.m.,.

according to the report.

A search of Kranjec’s car revealed a six-
inch glass smoking pipe which, according
to the police report, is commonly used for
smoking crack cocaine. A powdered

The University of Pittsburgh A1[h0U.8h the CU “em if

has temporarily blocked a request
by former associate director of
administrative services Mary
Cacali to deposition former Pitt
President Wesley Posvar.”

Cacali is currently threatening
to file a lawsuit against the
university, saying she was fired
because she was a whistleblower.
The charges filed with the
Prothonotary’s office in Pittsburgh
include wrongful discharge,
breach of contract and slander.
She was fired last May after the
university went through an
extensive probe into misuse of
the food service.

She was cleared by a probe
into the food service of intentional

because the university was
dissatisfied with the way the food
service was being run. Pitt did
not, however, specify problems
with Cacali’s management. '
Papers filed by Cacali’s attorney,
Daniel Ernsberger, state that
Posvar should be allowed to
deposition because he could pro-
vide certain documents proving
that she was wrongfully fired.

That mission is to improve some areas in

deficient, according to Student Government

Golden said’I{itt needs to improve certain
areas to improve academic life.

“One of the main _ areas that needs

improvement is in minority retention,”.

Car thief
captured
by prompt
Pitt police

By Renee Crespy
Asst. News Editor

Parking lot attendantjack
Cross’ quick thinking
stopped a crime almost
before it began.

Cross, who works the
night shift at the O’Hara
parking garage in Oakland,
said that around 4:30 a.m.
yesterday morning he saw
a man near one of the
vehicles. The vehicle
belonged to Cross, who had
parked it there while he
was working.

“I saw the guy over by
my truck, and he said he
was getting something out
of it. He didn’t realize it was
my truck. He took off down
O’Hara Street toward the
Syria Mosque. I immediately
picked up the phone and
called the Pitt police.”

According to Cross, it was
the campus police’s quick
actions that caught the thief.

“The Pitt police were
there in seconds; they are
always prompt, ” Cross said,
adding that the four
arresting officers should be
praised. “There is too much
criticism in this world. I
think it’s time for praise.”

Walt Waters, assistant
director of public safety said
a patrol car was in the area
when the call came in, and
it took two minutes to arrive
‘on the scene.

“Sometimes you "get a
break. Mr Cross called us
immediately, and we were
able to\ respond quickly.
Sometimes you get a call 10
or 15 minutes after it
happens," Waters said.

The suspect, who was
arrested as John Doe, has
still not been identiﬁed.

“The gentleman was
arrested as John Doe
because he didn’t have any
identiﬁcation on him, and
at the time of the report we
didn’t know who he was,”
Waters said.

The suspect was not
fingerprinted for identity
because according to
Waters, “unless there's a
major crime, it takes time.
You have to send
[fingerprints] to the FBI.”

Waters said the suspect
was sent downtown.

Officer Ron Dunne, a
desk ofﬁcer from the Zone
6 Pittsburgh police said that
he has no knowledge of the
suspect or his identiﬁcation.

“I don’t have anything on
this at all. If Pitt arrested
him and they don’t have a
name on him, I don’t either,”
said Dunne.

Damage to the vehicle
was estimated at $500,
according to Cross.

Victory liglo ts tradition reloztiz/ely 1/mi/enown      

By Lisa Tylak

For The Pitt News

If you have never noticed the

yellow glow from atop the
Cathedral of Learning after a Pitt
football victory,\then you are not
alone.

Many people are not aware
that the yellow “victory lights”
are turned on after Pitt wins a
game and are usually left on until
Monday morning.

“I’ve never seen the victory
lights, and I’ve never heard of the

victory lights,” said Pitt student
John Thomas.

There are various stories about
how the practice began, but
according to Bob Boyce, senior
facilities manager at the Office of
Facilities Management, it was
started by Edward Bozik, former
athletic director, about six years
ago.

Regardless of who started the
practice, there seemed to have
been just one idea in mind: Start
a football tradition at Pitt.

According to Bernie Conley,

an electrician in the Cathedral,

the original idea was to use blue
and gold lighting, but the blue
lights would not show up on the
building. So they made all eight
of the lights yellow. .

“It obviously hasn't caught on, ”
said Thomas, who believes that
more people would know about
it if it were a tradition that were
popular.

He said he thinks it would
make more sense if the tradition
were more closely connected with
the sport. He suggested leaving

the lights on in the stadium
instead.
- But others think the idea is a

good one and should be,‘

continued.

Student Government Board.

President Brent Saunders thinks
the lights are a great idea, but he
says they should be more
publicized. ,

He suggested advertising the
tradition and telling people about
it during first-year orientation.

“It’s one of the few traditions
Pitt has,” Saunders said.

 

Lack of funds lirnits study abroad program

By Kathleen Frank
For The Pitt News A

Financial relief for study-abroad candidates
may be in sight. I
According to Student Government Board
President Brent Saunders, students are in
favor of a $1 tuition increase to fund study-
abroad scholarships. ’
“So far everything’s been positive,” said
. Saunders, who has been circulating a petition
to gain student support for the program.

According to Angi Yucas, director of the
Study Abroad Office, students need to be
more in touch with foreign affairs. The
proposed tuition increase would remind all
students that the opportunity to study abroad
exists, she said. ‘

The national average for study abroad is
four percent, but less than three percent of
Pitt students study abroad, Yucas said.

Many students ‘want to study abroad but
fall into the middle—income range, where
they are not financially “needy,” but their

families cannot afford to finance the program,
according to Yucas. If the additional money

were available, students would be eligible

based on need, rather than merit.

Yucas said there is legislation pending in
Congress for aid to study-abroad programs,
but there are not many other avenues for
funding. -

Currently the Study Abroad Office receives
$10,000 a year from the College of Arts and
Sciences, but according to Yucas, it “just
doesn't go far enough.”

a stop sign and possession of a controlled sub-
stance and drug paraphernalia,” PeLel1is said.
The arresting officers could not be reached for
comment. Kranjec’s phone number is’ not
published at his request. .
According to City Court, Kranjec was ‘held

' with bond posted at $1,000. To be released, he ‘

had to pay 10 percent of his bond. Kranjec was
released yesterday at 3:45 p.m.
Pitt Public Safety Director William Brennan
referred all questions to University Relations. ‘
University spokesperson Bob Reteshka said
that Kranjec has been employed with Pitt campus
police since 1986..Kranjec has been suspended

indeﬁnitely without pay until the matter is
resolved, Reteshka said.

“We were told he was arrested last night. We
consider it a matter between him and the Pitts-
burgh police,” Reteshka said. “As far as we’re
concerned, llﬁanjecl is innocent until proven
guilty. There is a process he has to go through
with the city of Pittsburgh,” Reteshka said. '

Kranjec was seen earlier that night at the
intersection of Beltzhoover and Jucunda streets,
which is, according to the police report, an area
known for open drug sales. Kranjec was chased
by a Drug Task Force Team after being seen
talking to an unknown male’. The task force was
unable to apprehend Kranjec.

were a response by the South
African government to rescue the
ailing South African economy,
which has shown negative growth
for the past two years.

According to Vuba, as sanctions
are lifted, capital and investments
will pour into South Africa from
the United States and Western
Europe. Vuba fears that by
improving the economic
situation, the power of the current
regime will be more concen-

as the government under Willem
DeKlerk continues “to fool the
rest of the world with [its]
superficial reforms, blacks will
continue to be suppressed, and
the white minority government
strengthened.”

Crecentia Mofokeng of the Pan

African Congress agreed that the
“premature” sanctions will
strengthen the current
government and hurt the search
for democracy of black South
Africans. .

She mentioned that basic
hu man rights, such as freedom of
press, expression and speech,
are still denied.

Brutus said that reforms have
occurred to a minimal extent. He
said a few minor restrictions have
been lifted, including the ban on
his literature.

But he is quick to mention that
freedom of speech and expression
is still very limited.

Mofokeng added that to protest
you have to get permission from

' the group thatyou want to protest

against —— the government.

“The so-called freedom of
expression is simply another way
for the current regime to
manipulate the outside world,”
she said.

Ignorance is bliss
 __::,Former President Wesley Posvar has taken enough bites
bf his own shoe with the amount of  

‘ }to.put his foot in his mouth. a 

«a7Obviou_sly he’s getting tired of the t_a__ste.

~i I Posvar has been called upon by the attorneys of Mary

Cacali, former associate directorof administrative services,
who is threatening to file a lawsuit against Pitt for firing
her from her job. ’

Cacali was terminated after the university investigated
wrongdoings in the University of Pittsburgh’s food-
service department. '

. She was not found guilty of wrongdoing, but she was
fired anyway because Pitt was unsatisfied with the way
food services was being run. A

The attorneys claim that Posvar can provide documents
proving Cacali’s innocence, but Posvar has refused to
testify on her behalf. This action can only imply that
Posvar knows something but does not want to implicate
himself.

Pitt’s attorneys claim that Posvar’s testimony is irrelevant

and would only embarrass him. One would think he’d be
used to embarrassment by now.
‘ ' Posvartook his position seriously at the beginning of his
administration and did much good for Pitt. Now he has
become a nuisance to the Pitt community, which is left
wondering, “When is it all going to end?”

It is becoming common for the man in charge to not
know what’s going on within his organization. Ronald
Reagan, Robert Gates and john Marous have proved this
to us in the recent past. \

‘ Reagan, if you remember (even though -he "didn’t),

_' claimed to be ignorant of all incidents concerning the
 Iran-Contra affair. -

Gates, nominee for the head of the Central Intelligence
Agency, seems to know nothing about anything.

And Marous, who is the chairperson of the Board of
Trustees at Pitt, apparently had a momentary lapse of
eyesight and memory when he signed and read documents
regarding Posvar’s retirement settlement.

Although Cacali’s attorney, Daniel Ernsberger, also'said
that Posvar’s testimony was not a necessity right now, he
did not say that Posvar wouldn’t be subpoenaed in the
future. _

“I don’t know,” “I don’t remember,” “I don’t recall” and
“I never saw that” are not only getting boring but
repetitive as well.

Let’s hope Posvar can be a little more creative when he
is called on to respond to questions. I

These types of evasions are fast becoming a popular
trend, and Posvar must assume that he, too, as a man who
was in great power at a well-known university, can claim
ignorance in sensitive situations.

It will come as quite a shock to Posvar when he learns
that he is not above justice.

- And through the entire experience, I had grown
closer to God.
Finally, I had one more step to take. I had to tell

to hide in a dirty, Clark room that
suffocated me. I would hide from
scary things like my parents, God,
my schoolmates,and the scariest
of all: myself. But I slowly came
out and faced my fears and

taught me to respect other people
for their differences and to be
proud of mine. So I thought they
would learn to respect me. The
first time I told them, they kicked

learned that there is nothing to be
scared of. Why should anyone be afraid of
themselves? Or sex? My “coming out” has been
long, hard and ongoing. It also has been ve
liberating. "

I kind of always knew that I was gay, butl could
never call myself a fag. From cutting pictures of
guys in their underwear out of catalogs (at the age
of 6) to “wrestling” with a certain junior high friend,
I would not classify my actions as gay.

But in high school, I slowly started to question
my sexual urges toward men. I did not choose
these feelings nor to have people point and stare.
I did not get up on my 14th birthday and look in the
mirror and say, “Scott, puberty kicks in today. Are
you going to go for girls or guys?” Sexuality is not
a choice but a gift. And I had taken the first (and
hardest) step out of my closet. I had come out to
myself and accepted my gift.

The next step in cleaning my closet was to come
out to my friends. I did not know who to tell, how
to tell them or how they would take it. Saying “By
the way, I'm gay” is not too brilliant.

Instead I slowly told each friend. The reactions
wereas diverse as the people saying them were.
Some gave me their support; some avoided talking
about it, and some alienated me (Who needed

them anyway?) I found that the true friends laugh i

and joke with you about your sexuality, not at it.
Some of the teachers had heard about my
coming out and had given me their support.
My gym teacher though, quit ‘his job to work at
a Catholic school. I wonder if there was a connection.
Ilowever not everybody was as cool. Some
schoolmates I did not know taunted me. How do
rumors get started? It was actually said that I sued
.\lcDonald’s for $1 million (or was that $5,000,000)
in a discrimination suit. Some people were scared
to sit next to me or touch anything that I had
touched. I guess they were scared that they might
catch the “gay bug” and be gay, too.
j The next group that I “victimized” was my
church youth group. Unexpectedly, they took it

I quite well. (Most had heard rumors, anyway.) The

' me out of the house. I could not
believe that they did that. Whatever happened to
unconditional love? What happened to pride?
Respect? '

After thinking about the irony of the situation
and realizing that I was nothing without a high
school or college diploma (or my parent’s money),
I told" them that I went straight. How does one go
straight? I have tried too many times and failed. My
parents had always been manipulative control
freaks.

They chose my clothes, my friends, my major
(engineering) and what school to go to (why else
would I come to Pitt?) '

About two weeks ago they decided to drop by
and visit. I hadno time to “heterosexize” my room
and take the Calvin Klein jean guy off the wall. At
that point, like any bad relationship,“ they said that
it was over and disowned me. No money, no
college.

Coming out for. me has been a continuing’

experience. I must continue to clean and organize
my closet. Tomorrow, Oct. 11, is National Coming
Out Day and a great day to see the beauty and
freedom that wait on the outside of the many messy
closets. “Coming out” is not for everyone. A person’s
sexuality should be as private as they want to make
it. However I could not imagine myself continuing
to hide and lie to everyone.

There are about 2,500 ‘gay, lesbian and bisexual
students at Pitt. This does not count the many more
who are members of the faculty and staff. Most are
closeted-, and some are out.

Tomorrow is not just for homosexuals but for
everyone. I urge you to celebrate sexuality and
diversity. Tell a homosexual that you respect him
or her.

As a fag, I am not asking for a $1 million
retirement settlement or an $82,000 room. (I can
not even afford IKEA.) I just ask for a little respect.
Life passes by if you sit in a closet.

Liberati gets hat trick as Panthers roll to

Byjason Billings
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panthers soccer team
kickedtin the afterburners and
broiled alive the Slippery Rock
University Rockets 5-0 last night
at Pitt Stadium.

The first quarter stood host to

' two Panther goals by co-captain

Nick Liberati. The first goal came
on a free kick eight minutes into

‘the half. Liberati, on the feed

from Eric Prex, slammed-the ball
past Rocket goaltender Michael
Doutrich. Another eight minutes
later, Liberati spoke again on a
penalty kick," boosting the
Panthers’ score to two.

Perkins smashes re

By Rob" Pugliese
Staff Writer

‘Intimidation. It’s an important
part of football.

It’s also what the 1990 Pitt
team lacked. Opponents
bludgeoned their soft middle for
huge chunks of rushing yardage
and sliced through the heart of
the secondary for big plays.

It’s too bad for them that Lex
Perkins patrols the “alley” now.
Intimidation is the essence of
Perkins’ game, and now it is a
part of Pitt’s game, too.

The 6—foot, 3~inch, 185—pound
junior free safety carries the
reputation of a big—time hitter
who punishes receivers any time
they venture into his territory.*Pitt

fans saw Perkins at his finest,‘

with Pitt clinging to a 24-20 lead
over the Maryland Terrapins. The
Terps calmly drove to the Pitt 20-
yard line, and faced a‘ third-and-
10 with only 37 seconds
remaining. Quarterback Jim
Sandwisch fired a pass over the
middle, which split end Gene
Thomas looked to haul in close
to the goal line. At the last second
Perkins came crashing into
Thomas with a vicious hit that
separated the wideout from the
football and probably left him
dazed for hours,

“He came across the middle
kind of stretched out. I had the
opportunity to take his head off
and took advantage of it, ” Perkins
said. “It was just a matter of being
in the right place at the right
time.” I

Lately it seems.that Perkins has
been in the right place all of the
time. In four games this season

Perkins has 18 tackles and a‘

“You have a 95-percent chance
of making a penalty kick,” Liberati
said. “I should be expected to
score, and I did.”

“That first penalty kick was a
joke,” said Rockets head coach
Jim Herlinger, “and we found
ourselves in _a hole.’’ The Rockets
attempted to answer the Panthers’
goals but found thatbeing in debt
was more than they could handle.

“We were trying too hard,”
Herlinger said. “We were trying
to get out of the hole too fast.”

Throughout the entire first half

Pitt outshot the Rockets two to
one, penetrating the Rocket
defense almost every time it
touched the ball. Slippery Rock,

‘on the other hand, totaled four

number of hits that laid out
receivers. Panther opponents
have to be concerned about going
over the middle with Perkins on
the prowl.

“Lex brings a real force in the
secondary,” Pitt head coach Paul
Hackett said. “He’s a big-hitter
and at free safety is the center of
attention back there..”

Perkins arrived at Pitt after two
seasons at San Bernardino Junior
College in California, where he
earned team MVP honors in 1989.
Last year Perkins played only
three games before a ‘chipped
bone in his left, knee forced him
to redshirt. He said that Pitt’s
concern for academics was a

‘major -factor in his decision.

“Coach Hackett
expressed the importance of
academics, and I knew if I came
to Pitt I could graduate and do

- something else with my life after
football's over,” he said.

Perkins’ injury has not affected

his progress this season. He
admitted he was rusty at the
beginning of training camp but
has gradually worked his way
back. He is now very comfortable
in his role.

“Lex is off to an excellent start.
He had a tremendous game last
week,” Hackett said. “He really
woke up that wide receiver who
crossed the middle.”

Watching Perkins evokes

images of former San Francisco.

49er All-Pro and now—Los Angeles
Raider great Ronnie Lott, who
happens to be Perkins’ idol as
well. '

“I’ve always liked to play to a
certain “style like him,” Perkins
said. “I was considered a hitter at

In the face of adversity the Pitt

Cross country set to do battle in City Championships   .

By Keith Dowling
Staff Writer

When asked about Pitt’s highest
nationally—ranked men’s team last
year, many » students would
probably put basketball or
football at the top of their list.
Wrong.

The men’s cross—country team
will show how it reached 17th in
the country last year by competing

this Saturday at the City
Championships. As an added
bonus, this weekend’s race also
features the vastly improving
women’s team.

You can catch the start of the
race_ at Flagstaff Hill, with the
women’s competition beginning
at 10 a.m. and the men’s at 10:30
a.m. Also picking their way
through the falling leaves and
twisting turns of Schenley Park

Perkins

Continued from page 7 ~
games, the secondary is jelling
quickly.

“We’re a tightunit much tighter
than we were last year,” Perkins
said. “We have a great leader in
Steve Israel, and I think we’re

like a family this year—-very tight_

on and off the ﬁeld.”

Perkins talked aboutwatching
Notre Dame on television while
he was growing up and said that
he never really dreamed he would
ever play against the Irish.

“I’m real fired up, but I’m also
nervous. This is the biggest game
I've ever played in,” Perkins said.

Perkins’ performance on
Saturday will speak volumes
about Pitt’s defensive success
against an offense that rolls up
40 points per game. As the free

safety, Perkins is an “alley player" -

who will impact almost every
play, since Notre Dame pounds
the ball up_inside with its running
game and terrorizes the middle
with tight end Derek Brown.

“It’s an awesome offense. I

hope it’s a physical game. That’s '

the kind of game I like.

“It’s a tough offense to stop.
We know if we make a mistake,
we could pay for it with six
points, but we’re confident in
ourselves, in our abilities and
what we’ve been doing. I’m just
going to bring everything I have
and hope it will be enough.”

That’s Perkins’ basic philosophy
on football, “to bring everything
you have at all times.” He and the
Panthers are 14-point‘ underdogs
despite being ranked 12th in the
nation. This test provides a major
opportunity to silence the critics
and doubters.

“That’s the way life goes. When
things are bad, everybody jumps
off the bandwagon and says,
‘Yeah, they’re real bad,’ and when
things are good, people jump
back on the bandwagon and say,

‘Yeah, they’re real good.’ This is

a chance for us to show that
we’re a good football team.”

This season the men finished .

third at Penn State’s Invitational

‘ and took fifth out of 20 teams at

Notre Dame’s race. Notre Dame
is the oldest invitational in the
country, and Mike Formica’s win
this past Friday _made it the second
year in a row that a Pitt runner
claimed the individual title. This
weekend’s race is crucial for. the

Panther pack as each runner is
constantly working to keep
varsity status.

Speaking of packs, the Lady
Panthers have made a tradition
of having its top three within 20
seconds of each other, and a
fourth runner, Jen Hrach, is
getting closer with every meet.
“It’s amazing how much the
women’s team has improved over
the past year,” Formica said.

“They now have a coach (men’s .

coachjim Lear); they’re physically
stronger and they even have their
own uniforms." _ _
This season the women harriers
have won their first invitational
and finished third at both Penn

State’s Spike Shoe and Notre’

Dame’s Invitational.

The lady harriers
demolished Bucknell in a recent
dual meet, 18-36.

A doozy of a matchup here as
both teams smell Sugar. Pure

The Vols come in ranked 4th in
the nation behind an awesome

defense. The Gatorsare ranked
10th nationally and boast a
balanced offensive attack.
Orange and White are the
colors of a creamsicle, but the
Vols ain’t soft and creamy. The
defense is dope, led by MLB
Shon Walker and free safety Dale
Carter. This defense has

controlled every contest this year.
Chris Mirns has been reinstated
after giving in to Coach Johnny

Pickens is the nation’s best. Kelly
has a nasty habit of throwing to
the other team (9 int.) this year,
and turnovers could burn ‘em,
although they haven’t yet.

The Gators haven’t forgotten
the punishing 45-3 loss the Vols
pinned on ‘em last year, so
revenge will be a major motive.
That and 72,000 screaming
maniacs. The “fun-and—gun”
attack scores 52 points a game

and will face a major test against

the orange crush.

_ The defense shut out LSU 16-0
last week in Baton Rouge, the
first time the purple and gold
Tigers had been blanked since
’8S. The team speed here is
tremendous, an asset that will
combat Pickens and company.
Tackle Brad Culpepper has made
running an unpleasant and
hopeless prospect against this
crew, with LBs Ephesians Bartley
and Tim Paulk "pounding like
Derrick Thomas.

Look for the- Tennessee defense
to control this contest, with big
returns by Pickens and Carter
looming large. We’ll take the

nuggets. Take Tennessee +4 1/
2.
Penn State (5-1) at (-9 1/2)
Miami (4-0) at the Orange Bowl.

ABC, Saturday at noon.

Joe Paterno and his 9th-rated
Lions will see their National
Championship dream smashed
like a rotten Halloween pumpkin
in the Hades—like atmosphere of
the Orange Bowl. Miami’s team
speed will absolutely kill State.
Brian loves Lion wideout Terry
Smith, and I happen to agree,
seeing as’ how he has almost
beenﬂthe entire offense lately.
Don’t underestimate the mean
defense of PSU; it’11 dish out its
share of punishment, but Kevin
Williams and the ‘Canes should
smoke them come the second
half.

Powerful fullback Stephen
McGuire suffered a sprained ankle
early against Oklahoma State and

is questionable, but it won’t

matter. Penn State's offensive line
is suspect at best.

So Jesse Arrnstead, Michael
Barrow and Anthony Hamlet will
broil Sacca. Take Miami -9 1/2.

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1991

UNIVERSITY or pmsnuneu

Annie Sprinkle prepares to relieve this gay man of his virginity in one of the films featured in this month’s Lesbian and Gay Film Festival.

199 1 PITTSBURGH INTERNATIONAL

By Mark Smith
Staﬂ“ Writer

About three weeks ago, State Rep. Ron
Gamble warned Pittsburgh about a film
festival being held in Pittsburgh from Oct.
10 through Oct. 20. Representative Gamble
a few years ago, demanded warninglabels
on dangerous rock records. With the moral
minority promoting the 1991 Pittsburgh
International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival,
you know it’s got to be good.

Dan Schott, a programmer and a board
member of the Film Festival, described the
festival. “\X/e’re looking at a broad scope
of form and content with the Festival.
Issues include AIDS, Civil Liberties, Sex,
Transvestism, campy narratives and so
on.”

Most scheduled events will take place
Downtown at the Fulton Theater on Sixth

I Street and the Pittsburgh Filmmakers

Screening Room at 205 Oakland Avenue
in Oakland. 1 highlighted some of the
more interesting films for the festival from
October 10-16. Next week, look for the
second half of the festival and a review of
the great sneak preview on Saturday.
Thursday, Oct. 10. The Festival begins
with a presentation by the Pittsburgh Gay
Cable Network at the Screening room.
Friday, Oct. 11. Not only National
Coming Out Day, a celebration in the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Communities,
but also the kickoff for features in the
Festival.
7 p.m. —— Time Off and Together Alone,
Fulton. Time Oﬂ’ is the first Israeli film to
deal in a serious way with homosexuality

in the military. Taking place at the time of
the 1982 Lebanese war, a shy young man
soon finds himself in an embrace with a
butch lieutenant.
7 p.m. — Anthem, "Good Christian
Peoples. Gay and lesbian African-
Americans discussing their religious beliefs
and others’. Screening Room.
9 p.m. — Swamp, follies, Stephen and Age
12, Screening Room. Stephen is a love
story of two gay twin brothers. If you like
Life in Hell’s Akbar and Jeff, this might
give you something to think about.
9 p.m. —— Le joupon Rouge, Fulton
11:30 — Midnight Movie Series Girl
Parts. Features two current films and two
from the past by women exploring
women’s bodies. According to Schott,
“The films to be presented are We're
Talleing Vulva and Nice Girls Don ’t Do It,
which is an exploration’ of female
ejaculation.”
Another one by Barbara Hammer, the
most prolific female ﬁlmmaker, Women I
Love, is a five-year composite of her lovers.

 

   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   

 

OCTOBER 20

There are scenes with fruit and flowers.

Anne Severson’s NeartheBig Chahra caps
off the night.

Schott ties in the historical roots of gay
film by running the midnight series,
which runs on both Friday and Saturday
nights, this and next weekend.
“Commemorating the beginnings of
underground avant—garde gay films, these
films are being shown in the spirit of these
films from the "503 and ’60s."

Saturday, Oct. 12.

10 am. —4 p.m., Symposium: How gays
respond to film, University of Pittsburgh,
David Lawrence Hall, Room 211. This one
is free. How do gay audiences react to
film? Find out. Films from the immortal

Judy Garland, the pre—stonewall gay icon .

(keep Madonna in mind) will be discussed.
For more information, call John
Champagne at 624-6539.

7 p.m. — Honored by the Moon, Chinese
Characters, They Are Lost, To Vision
Together, Sex 6 Sandinistas, Screening
Room. Sex G-Sandinistasis the hotpick.
It explores gay men and lesbians joining
the Sandinistas’ revolution in the late ’70s
against the U.S.-backed government. After
the revolution, with the church still a
powerful player, gays find liberation does
not extend to them and they pressure for
change. Pro—gay reforms and equality for
women is now being ‘fought by the new
U.S.—bacl<ed, right—wing government.
9 p.m. —'— Homo Promos, Fulton.
9 p.m. — Same as Screening Room Friday
at 7 p.m.
11 p.m. —Midnight Movies: Boy Parts.
Similar idea to Friday night’s Girl Parts.
You can figure it out.
Sunday, Oct. 13.
3 p.m. — Fearless TV, Screening Room.
A collection of great videos, including A
Hard Reigns Gonna Fall. A must for
activists. This tape was madefor New
York’s DIVATV (Damned Interfering Video
Activist Television). It borrows its imagery
from a Bob Dylan video to emphasize the
AIDS crisis. Drawings of AIDS activists
and a series of pictures produce a personal
and emotional video.
Also Forbidden Fruit Fight Back! Deep
Dish TV produces great political

documentaries. Fruit looks at attacks on

the civil rights of lesbians and gays. One

scene includes the gay bashing of Irish

gays and lesbians and New York City

Public Enemy N o. 1?
Did the brothers work it out?

Public Enemy

Apocalypse 9]: Tbelfnemy Strilees
Black.

Def Jam/ CBS/ Sony Records

Two weeks ago, Public Enemy
didn’t have a new record out.
What they had was an overplayed
“remix” (That word is used very
loosely) of “Bring The Noise”

- (now spelled “Bring Tha Noize”

to give it that ’90s, edgy feel) with
metalheads Anthrax. They also
had me real pissed off thinkin’
the brothers hadifallen off. That
was also two weeks ago.

Now I'm not sure where I stand
with the Enemy. This ain’t the
first time I thought PE had fallen
over. When Griff spewed his anti-
semitic hate jargon a couple of
years back, I thought they were
done. But Chuckie D took that

hate (and all the controversy)
and mixed it with “the dominant
gene theory” and blasted back
with Fear Of A Black Planet, a
phat wax deliverance.

So you" see where I stand,
knowing PE is dope but hoping
it hasn’t sold it to the masses by
teaming with‘Anthrax. Maybe if I
liked the ,r{re;nix” it would be
otherwisefbut my mind crumbles
like paper‘. every team I hear it.

Public Enemy already" gets
plenty of negative press, but the

Olds 98 posse may need a tuneup. "

What thelhell are they playing

with Anthrax for? This crossover

metal/rap crap sucks. I'll even
suggest that PE is bringing the

wrong element into rap. I’ve seen
too many followers who have no

respect for the rhythm but like
the scene, so they jump on the

THE pri"-‘r News-, Thursday, octdiiusitlo, 1991

Byjason Hillman

Photography Editor

One of the bright moments in
moviemaking over the last couple

_ of years is the increasing number

of _African-American—oriented
movies, like Boyz ‘n the Hood,
New Jack Cityor any of the many
Spike Lee movies. Because these
movies became box-office
successes, “black” is now the
rage in Hollywood. It was

inevitable that a movie like

COME AND

Ricochet would hit the movie
theaters.

Ricochet is your basic
Hollywood-thriller clone. Rookie
patrol officer Nick Styles captures
hired killer Earl Talbot Blake in a
daring incident that a nearby
civilian happens to catch on film.
Styles’ career skyrockets when
the videotape is shown on TV,
while Blake goes to jail and
dreams of doing all sorts of nasty
things to Styles. You could
probably guess the rest. .

The kicker is that Denzel
Washington, a black man, plays
Styles, andjohn Lithgow, a white
man, plays Blake. Is this
Hollywood trying to make up for
all the racial stereotypes it has
fostered over the last century?
No.

This is Hollywood trying to
make a buck when it realized that
people will watch movies with
black protagonists. The makers
of Ricochet are ‘hoping that it
won't matter if those protagonists
don’t have any character depth.

The movie is well—packaged.
The cinematography is sharp and
vivid, and the cast is great.
Washington is an Oscar winner
(and well-deserved), and Lithgow
is a terrific actor. His performance

as Roberta Muldoon in The
World According to Garp was
deserving of an Oscar. Both do
their best with what they have.
Lithgow gets the more
interesting character, but he is
one of the many psycho
“Hannibal Lecter” spinoffs,
which are getting to be tedious.
Washington has more one-liners
than Arnold. He is so mouthy
that even his sworn enemy,
Blake, is screaming at him to
simply shut up. Even with an
iron bar sticking through his
forearm, Styles still manages to
talk trash. You have to admire
that kind of tenacity. Ice-T, who
plays Style’s gang—leader/drug
lord/boyhood friend Odessa,
has some fun cameos.

Ricochet basically a Hollywood-thriller clone ﬂick

Ricochet also has some really
gross scenes, including one
involving power tools. Another
scene is in a prison, where Blake
and another inmate have this
bizarre samurai fight with phone
books as armor and iron bars as
weapons. Very weird.

I have to be honest. I came out
of the movie theater thinking the
movie wasn’t bad. I mean, when
comparing it to the Steven Seagal-
genre, this movie stacks up pretty
well. And the last movie I had seen
was UnnecessaryRoughness, which
may have been the worst movie
I’ve seen this year. So my standards
were lower than usual.

It wasn’t until afterwards, when
I discussed the movie with a friend,
that I realized how big a role
exploitation played in this movie.
Not that exploitation doesn't play
a large role in many movies coming
out of ‘Hollywood. ’It’s just that
Ricochet is one of the first that is
exploiting the success of “black”
films like Boyz in the Hood. The
script could have been laying in
someone’s office for 10 years. Of

— course, then Styles was white (and

Burt Reynolds), his sidekick was

black and his boyhood friend was

probably in the Mafia. Injected

into the script is an Aryan—power

but that frontin’ because of color
is wrong, then I ain’t bitin’. You
schooled too much, Chuck, to
have to resort to a hit to prove a
point.

Just a pondering mind relay.
You make the call. Regardless,
PE is kickin’ new vinyl. The
production credits say the
Imperial Grand Ministers of Funk
(Stu Robertz, “C—Dawg” Depper,
G-Wiz and The JBL) dropped the
beats, while the Bomb'Squad
played executives this time 0’
round. The Ministers pickup
somewhat where the original
bombers left off: bustin’ power
moves, throwin’ hard rights. The
bass isn’t as deep, and the

production is a little crispier,

giving the record a looser (Dare
I say happier?) feel. It don’t strike
as angry as in the past. The gun
is on stun more than attack.
The whole thang comes
slammin’ out tha box with the
siren-heavy “Lost At Birth” intro,
which busts into “Rebirth,” which
bumps. “Nighttrain” follows,
wailing the chorus repetitively,
as true to Bomb Squad form as it’s
chaotic and grinding. The new
hit, “Cant Truss it,” gets rek over
a swirling loop of airaid siren,
while Chuck tells his story. “Move”

lacks the deep bass but has layers
of scratches over fast high—hats.
But some jams don’t work. “Shut
‘em Down” is actually too droning,
while the rootsy “  Yo Nigga” is
weak.

“How To Kill A Radio
Consultant” is a sweet chaos of
machinery and some slammin’,
slammin’ horns that drops into a
Sister Souljah interlude, givin’ a
documentary feel that runs smack
into “By The Time I Get To
Arizona,” a deep, organ-funk loop
— hypnotic and as psychedelic
as De La. Chuck throws a deep
breakdown, then arrives in ‘Zona,
hittin’ in classic style. Haunting.

“More News at 11” is a bouncy
Flavor Flav number with a white
voice of Harry Allen. This one
gets laughs. “Letter To The NY
Post” is another jumpin’—off Flav
unit, while “Get The Fuck Outta
Dodge,” a hard—ass—to-find B—side
of “Brothers "Gonna Work It Out,”
ends up on the LP and is all a that.

Freejozzz lives on Sonny S/oarroc/e’s latest"

Sonny Sharrock
Asia The Ages
Axiom (Island) Records

Sonny Sharrock‘ is one of the
most diverse jazz guitarists
around. A veteran of jazz scenes
gone by, his harmonies and
rhythms are still complex and
interesting. On his latest effort,
/Isle T beAges, Sharrock surrounds
himself with a superb cast and
weaves components of jazz, blues,
rock, country and soul together
for an obviously eclectic album.

The recording was done
without a piano, which isn’t
uncommon. Good guitar players
can take the place of pianists, and
having a pianist here would have
disrupted the sound. Saxophonist
Pharoah Sanders is a featured
guest on both tenor and soprano.
Sanders, who gained famewas. a
disciple ofJoh,n.Co1tra'ne’and free

—;;ja7.z, is typicallyvwild in most

spots. But his wild sound is really

‘ anything but predictable.

The rhythm for the section is
provided by :ElvinJones on dru ms
and Charnett Moffett on bass.
These two give the record much
of its forward progression. Jones,
a legendary drummer who also
played with Coltrane, was the
perfect choice for ensemble
sound. Moffett is also important,
for he supplies the moving bass
sound that must keep track of
Sharrock and Sanders.

There are six songs on the
recording, and all merit a listen.

 
   

624-PLAY

 

“As We Used To Sing” is the most
“regular” jazz song and features a
fantasticlsoprano- sax solo by
Sanders. Sharrock’s solo is almost
as good. Sharrock is willing to
share the spotlight on this album
and it works to his advantage,
overall. With all the talented
musicians here, he couldn’t go
wrong.

Both “Many Mansions” and
“Little Rock” are listening
adventures, and both are driven
by the work of Jones. Jones has
proven himself as the drummer
who uses cymbals the best,
attacking them and urging the
song on. Songs with Jones are
never, ever boring. These two
songs also feature Sanders, who
on “Mansions” is at his chaotic
best, wailing on the,te’n.o‘r’ like a
demon possessed.” His solo on
“Little Rock" is a softer soprano
solo, but also has its good points.
Both songs have a bluesy—rock
feel that is strange but really good
in this context. "

Moffett shines .on most of the
selections, and especially on
“Who Does She Hope To Be?”

which is a soulful tune in the
genre of New Orleans jazz.
Moffett’s walking bass comes
through very clearly and isnit
covered by Sharrock’s sound at
all. Sharrock’s solo uses vibrato
quite effectively.

The opener, “Promises Kept,”
is not among my favorites,
although it has a fantastic solo by
Moffett. Everybody gets a chance,
so it is an exhibition of talent.
Unfortunately the tune isn’t-built
on much at all.

The last song, “Once Upon A _
Time,” is played in a veryfree
style, as Jones has complete
rhythmic freedom. It is also a
little bit grungy, which makes it
more interesting. But it is not a
great example of Sharrock’s ability
to work in and out of harmonies,
a talent few guitarists possess. ,

The musicians on this album
almost guaranteed its success just ‘
by showing up. Thankfully they
did more than that, and the result
is a tremendous collection of
music from some of the great
free-jazz players. =

Dead

Continued from page S-6
Clark Five. Humor is time plus
tragedy, but if it breaks, it’s not
funny. On his soon-to—be-
released tra_ck, “Without A
Doubt,” Edwards has a
transfiguration. But a pompadour
and a Man From Uncle suit is still
out of the question.

Prisonshake: If you work, play,
drink and conjugate infinitives
hard, then there’s your cup of
three—day—old swill. Verse—chonis—
verse regular. Guaranteed to
enable you to punch your way
out of any bar.

Take this co-worker friend of
mine. He don’t like the Coltrane
I play — sez it’s elevator music.
He don’t like it when Big Black is
busted on 10 — sez it’s mind-
numbing noise. But he does like
Teenage Fanclub and
Superchunk, a hard guy who can
take any amount of heat and will
always be in the kitchen.
Prisonshake is hard and heavy,
like two-week—old bilge from
industrial fryers.

Then there is Sebadoh, kissing

group which seems to have little

- to do with anything expect that it

gives Styles the opportunity to
beat the crap out of one of its
members.

That Hollywood now feels that
African—Americans are worth
exploiting in this way is probably
a good sign. But one movie like
New jacle City is worth 20 movies
like Ricochet. Unfortunately the
latter type of movie is going to be
far more common in the near
future.

cousins of Dinosaur Jr., who are
less on the fuzz scorch, more on
man-boy reflection. Sehadoh
Three, their latest, is the best to
date — much less quirk and very
much more on the cohesive

brevity of the D. Boone, circa

1984. Ditties like “Black-Haired
Gurl” and “-Hoppin’ Up And
Down” hurl you into a Bourges
warp. Suddenly you’re on a firefly
safari or kickin’ your Pro—Keds
into the twilight of a Friday-night
game of release. Lou Barlow,
formerly of the Dino juniors,
fronts this outfit. _

Opening the show will be locals
Wimp Factor 14, who are now
reveling in their semi—success of
bookings and airplay along the
east coast scene. _

Minimal ’s the tic/eet here as My
Dad Is Dead, Prisonshake,
Sebadoh and Wimp Factor 14
bring their traveling tour to the

‘Burgh fora 6p. m. all—ages show

Festival

York St. Patrick’s Day parade. Anti—gay protests
surrounded the inclusion of a gay Irish
organization. Marching with gay Irish people,
Mayor Dinkins had a bottle thrown at his head.
Other shots include the anti—violence group, the
Pink Panthers, patrolling New York City streets
protecting gay people. i

5 p.m. — Short and Sizzling: According to
Schott, “explicit, safer-sex videos” including safer-
sex videos for women, Screening Room.

How to Have a Sex Party by House of Chicks
is a response to the lack of safer sex information
for lesbians. Former performance artists now
become safer-sex educators. Videos show women
how to have fun sex with cut—up condoms and
tulips. Sounds good to me.

A 25- Year—Old G’ayMan Loses His Virginity To
A Woman. A neat title that speaks for itself. With
Philip Roth and Anni Sprinkle.

5 p.m. — TogetherAlone, Fulton.

7 p.m. '— Urgent Voices, which includes Mad '

Dylees by the Women Collective Exploding
Psychiatric Myths. The video explores women
fighting the mental—health bureaucracy/
establishment. The Lady Protest is a real short
tape, juxtaposing the March On Washington
Against the War and an interview with Constance

Mayer, a glamorous local activist. Lady looks at

— everyday protests of life leading to organized .

forms of protest and activism. The Epistemology
of Disco speaks for itself. Screening Room.
7 p.m. — My Father is Coming, Fulton. German

filmmaker Monika Truet’s comedy looks at a .

woman coming out to her father.

9 p.m. — Night Out and Billy Turners Secrets,
Fulton.

Monday, Oct. 14.

9 p.m. — L’Homme Blessed, Fulton.

Wednesday, Oct. 16

7 p.m. —- No Slein O_/7MyAss, Fulton. Skip class
for this one; I will. Toronto director Bruce‘
LaBruce will steal the show with S/ein. LaBruce
plays a hairdresser who picks up a skinhead in
a park and develops an interesting relationship.
Shot in sensual and low—quality black & white,
LaBruce creates a very sexy and unpretentious

_,love story. Actually there is a large, gay, punk/

non-fascist skinhead underground in Toronto.
Hopefully this ﬁlm will capture some of that
magic. 3
9 p.m. —— Forbidden Love, Fulton.
