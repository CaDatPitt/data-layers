believed to be connected with
a criminal incident at the

Stuck in a Pitt Police van,
Troy feels helpless.

This is because for the past
year and a half, he has been
patrolling the streets of
Oakland as a member of the
Pitt bicycle patrol.

As he drives down Bigelow,
he radios to a fellow bike
police member and asksgher
to cruise over to Forbes Quad
and check for the suspect.
Frustrated because he is
confined behind a glass win-
dow, Troy intensely scans the
parking lot across from
Hillman Library and a small
portion of Forbes Avenue as

“I hate cars,’ says Troy.
“On a bike you can move
around more and you’re not a

_slave_ to traffic.”

Tonight is an unusual
evening for Troy because the
force is short—staffed, which
explains why he started his
Friday, 3 to 11 shift in a
police van.

Pulling the van into the
parking garage under Forbes

his watch and says something
about a waste of two hours.

It is almost five o’clock and
Troy hasn’t been on his bike

Cystic fibrosis is an
inherited genetic disorder
which afflicts more than
50,000 people. Patients
usually die by the age of
29, simply because they can
no longer breathe.

A research team at Pitt
has made a significant
advancement in treating the
disorder before it takes
hold. They are attacking the
cause of the disease, a
defective gene, while still
in the womb.

According to a report
published in the July issue
of Gene Therapy, a team of
scientists at the University
of Pittsburgh Medical
Center has performed the

first successful fetal lung .

gene transfer using a retro-
virus.

The retrovirus serves as a
vector, an agent which acts
as a carrier or transporter.
A gene is attached to the
virus and then introduced
into the body.

The vector used by the
research team was a retro-
virus that had been altered
so that it could integrate
normally into a host cell’s
genetic material.

“Using this method, clini-
cians could treat the genetic
abnormality before it gives
rise postnatally to a disor-
der that permanently dam-
ages the lungs,” said Bruce
Pitt, pharmacology profes-
sor at UPMC.

Researchers first discov-
ered the gene that caused

CF in 1989. When defec---

Speakers protest proposed financial aid cuts

By Danielle E. Shuster

. For The Pitt News

Shouts of “What do we
want? Student Aid! When do
we want it? Now!” echoed
from the William Pitt Union
lawn Friday afternoon, as
the “Save Student Aid” cam-
paign rolled on.

The highlight of the cam-
paign will be today, as Vice
President Al Gore will speak
on the Cathedral of Learning

- - . r « . .

Lawn, concerning possible
cuts in aid for Pitt students.

Julie Crowell, president of
Pitt’s Student Government
Board, said Vice President
Gore was being brought to
Pitt’s campus because of his’
and the Clinton administra-
tion’s commitment to stu-
dent aid.

The Clinton administration
and several Republican
politicians, including
Pennsylvania Senator Arlen

»

Specter, have made a stand
to keep student financial aid.

Representatives from Pitt,
Duquesne University,
Chatham College, Carnegie
Mellon University and
Community College of
Allegheny County spoke at
Friday’s press conference.
These schools make up
Pittsburgh Area Student
Action Coalition, founded to
combat federal student aid
cuts. Each speaker focused

on a different angle of sav-
ing federal student aid.

Jim Powell, Duquesne

"The American public
overwhelmingly supports

The University Police Department welcomes the return of the students to campus. We would like
to remind you of three ways to stay safe: (1) use commonsense, (2) be aware of your surroundings,
and (3) call the University Police if you have a problem at 624-2121.

Theft continues to be the criminal incident most committed on campus. The majority of thefts are of
unattended property left in open offices, con‘.-anon areas, and libraries. Please guard against theft.

Never leave your property unattended or unsecured. Carry your valuables on you. Most theft can
be avoided. »

 A night of tea and
dancing for Piﬁls

Inclonesion students

 By William A. Rodgers
 For the Pitt News

For the 75 Indonesian stu-

 dents at Pitt, Saturday night
4. was a homecoming of sorts.

That evening, the'Asian
studies program presented
Indonesian night. The
evening was designed to cel-
ebrate and inform about the
often forgotten archipelago
in Southeast Asia. The group
of islands is continuing to

 celebrate its golden anniver-

sary, which occured last

 month.

Events of the night includ-

 ed dancers with bright, color-
 ful costumes and slow,

graceful movements of wav-
ing arms and swaying fold-
out fans. The music consist-
ed mainly of percussion
instruments, but melody was
also created from the large
array of pitches.

Some of the other events
included a fashion show,

consisting of children wear-
ing traditional costumes of
different areas; a martial arts
demonstration; and a demon-
stration of various instru-
ments and dances of
Indonesia.

Indonesian ambassador
Arifin Siregar was the hon-
ored guest of the evening.
During his 24-hour stay in
Pittsburgh, he toured the
nationality rooms in the
Cathedral of Learning, had
tea -with interim Chancellor

,Mark Nordenberg and partic-

ipated in the night’s festivi-
ties.

Diane Dakis of the Asian
studies program said that
before World War 11,
Indonesia was controlled by
the Dutch. During the war,
Japan gained control of the
multi-island country. After
the war the Dutch tried to
regain domination, but
Indonesia declared its own

Ge! out of my way

I need cl computer, NOW

By Julian Neiser
Senior Staff Writer

The looming deadline of
finals week has flushed the
Pitt campus into the com-
puter labs. Your sweat from
tension is replaced by phys-
ical toil, because you have
just run from every lab in
search of an open computer.

After you win a coveted
seat in front of a computer
and you print out your lat-
est stroke of brilliance, you
run to the printer, only to
find a one-hour wait. It’s
noon, and the paper is due
at 12:30.

You are stuck, and there
is nothing you can do.

This is the reality of the
dreaded “computer crunch”
where students seem to wait
until the last minute to do
work, and then they all do it
at the same time. With
27,852 students at the main
campus, the student to com-
puter ratio is 51-to-l.

“If the students could try
and use the labs early in the

morning, or late at night,
the problems we had last
year won’t happen again,”
said David Schatz, assistant
to the director of Academic
Computing.

With seven labs contain-
ing 536 Macintosh and
DOS-based computers, and
with two of the seven labs
open 24 hours a day during
the week, Schatz said that
students have options to
work outside of the mid—day
crunch period.

Last December, in an
effort to accommodate stu-
dent needs, 24 computers
were added to the universi-
ty’s inventory, and existing
printers were switched to
labs that received the most
use. ’

For this year, a 52-seat,

lab was created for the cal-
culus and engineering class-
es that were tying up half of
both the Cathedral of
Learning and Lawrence

' Hall labs.

“These changes should
bring significant improve-

 ©N PITT IF
ENTS S57

ments for this year,” Schatz
said.

Another problem in the
labs is when students do
what Schatz calls “non-crit-
ical” work during the peak
hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Tensions can arise between
students when someone is
sending e-mail to a friend,
while another student is
waiting to write a term
papen

Schatz said a letter was
posted last December ask-
ing students to avoid using
“fun things” like e-mail and
the Internet during the mid-
day peak hours.

To keep things running
smoothly in the labs, and
because of normal attrition,
Schatz said that 40 new stu-
dent consultants have been
hired. The consultants’
main job is to answer ques-
tions and to troubleshoot
any problems that may
arise.

Some consultants feel
they are the focal point of

Funds for Pitt AIDS researchers decreasing

By Christopher Lawrence
Staff Writer

As Congress continues its
massive budget cuts, health
care professionals from Pitt
are lobbying for the restora-
tion of funds for AIDS edu-
cation and training.

On Aug. 4, the House of
Representatives passed an
appropriations bill that elim-
inated all funding for the
national AIDS Education
and Training Center
Program.

The $16.3 million neces-
sary to fund the AETC
amounts to only one percent
of the total federal AIDS
budget

“The elimination of this
program would seriously
compromise our ability to
help prevent the spread of
the disease,” said Linda
Frank, co—principal investi-
gator and senior project

director of the Pennsylvania
AIDS Education and
Training Center and assistant
professor of public health

and nursing at the University.

of Pittsburgh Graduate
School of Public Health.

The AETC is the only pro-
gram that rapidly and com-
prehensively educates health
and social service providers
in the field of HIV/AIDS and
continues to update them
regarding changing stan-
dards of care.

“The disease is always
changing,” said Monto Ho,
principal investigator of the
Education and Training
Center and chair of the
department of infectious dis-
eases and microbiology at
the GSPH. “This program is
necessary to keep health care
providers up to date.”

The ETC, part of a net-
work of 15 national centers,
is the result of a collabora-

  

a nutritionist at 383-1830.

This program is FREE to Pitt students
and sponsored b
Student Health Service-Health ducation Office

‘GSPH and

between the
the Medical
College of
Pennsylvania/Hahnemann
University.

“Between Hahnemann and
the University of
Pittsburgh,” Ho said, “we
take care of the whole state
of Pennsylvania.”

Initially funded in 1988,
the ETC has trained more
than 30,000 health care
providers. Nationally, the
AETC has instructed more
than 300,000 people.

The ETC program is for
physicians, dentists, nurses
and anyone else who works
as part of the health—care
team in treating people with
the HIV disease.

“As the number_of women
infected with HIV disease
increases, there will be a rise
in the number of children
who are born with HIV as
well,” Frank said. “It’s

tive effort

important to educate health
care providers about how to
do prevention counseling
with their clients to prevent
people from getting HIV-
infected to begin with.”

The ETC holds clinical
conferences, both in
Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.
as well as in rural areas all
across the state. It offers a
wide range of programs
which are tailor—made for the
people who are asking for
them.

“We may get a call from a
certain area where they’re
having a rise in the number
of women with the disease,”
Frank said. “We’ll go out
and do a program on clinical
management issues in treat-
ing women with HIV.”

According to feedback
from health care workers
who treat AIDS patients, the

align the respiratory and
digestive tracts to produce
an abnormally thick, sticky
mucus. This mucus clogs
the lungs and can act as a
locus for recurrent infec-
tions.

“Over 95 percent of
patients will die from some
pulmonary complication,”
Pitt said.

The UPMC study
involved transferring a
gene into the lungs of fetal
sheep while they were
developing inside the
womb.

According to Pitt, the
interest in gene transfer

came from work in trying V

to therapeutically affect
acute lung injury in the
newborn.

“We have other studies
going on trying to influence
the outcome of acquired
lung disease,” Pitt said.
“Along the way, some of
the vectors, such as the
retroviral vector, seemed to
be useful for affecting lung
disease that had an inherit-
ed basis, like CF.”

Cells targeted for gene
therapy do not normally
divide in the mature lung,
but are more likely to
divide in the developing
lung.

Since the retrovirus
requires cells to be divid-
ing, the natural stage while
in utero, when there are
more dividing cells than at
any other time.

According to the Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation, a cure,
when it is finally found,
will most likely involve
gene therapy, as well as
drug treatment and protein
therapy.

The research team is cur-
rently studying the transfer
of therapeutic genes into
sheep fetal lungs. They are

also modifying the retro-*

virus to enhance its compe-
tency as a vector.

“The next step is to deliv-
er the genes at a higher
efficiency,” Pitt said.

bike patrol to pull cars over.

“We get people for DUI,
reckless driving and running
red lights,” Troy said.

While all of this may
sound adventurous and fun,
being a bike patrol officer is
very serious and hard work.

Just like any other police
officer, Pitt’s bike patrol
wear bullet proof vests and
carry Glock nine millimeter
guns. The uniform also con-
sists of a radio, to hear the
dispatcher; mace; two sets of
handcuffs; a helmet; and a
double magazine clip holder,
for extra ammunition.

In case you are wondering,
that is a lot of equipment.
Now think about riding
around onva bicycle for eight
hours a day through all sorts
of weather conditions. That
is what these officers do
year round.

Why did these officers
volunteer for such hard
work? Well, they admit they

didn’t quite know what they
were getting into.

“At first I thought, ‘how
wierd,”’ Budzik said. “But I
like to try new things and
thought I’d give it a shot.”

“It was new,” Troy said.
“And I knew it could work if
the right people did it.”

Budzik recalls the first day
of her bike training.

“I was the only female in
the class,” Budzik said.
Jokingly, she said she asked
the instructor, “Do women
do this?”

Budzik is one of two
female riders on the Pitt bike
patrol and says there have
been several obstacles she
had to overcome. For
instance, she had to get a
special seat designed specifi-
cally for women.

“The seat the guys use was
really bad for my hips,”
Budzik said.

She said it was difficult in
the beginning because she
had problems that male
members did not encounter,

and she had no one to ask.

“Pittsburgh Power [a com-
petitive race team in
Pittsburgh] has been really
helpful,” Budzik said. “Now
I am finally accustomed to it
all.”

Budzik says she is in great
shape and is a more versatile
officer. V

“I like it because people
don’t see me as the typical
donut—eating cop,” Budzik
said.

Sometimes the bike patrol
gets flak because they do
things like ride on the side-
walks, ride down bus lanes
or go the wrong way down
Forbes Avenue.

“There’s no point in hav-
ing us if we can’t take short
cuts,” Budzik said.

“The advantage to being
on a bike is that we can
move faster and go where
cars can’t,” said Troy.

independence through a
national movement.

Dakis was particularly
excited about the evening’s
use of an Indonesian musical
instrument called a gamelan.

She said that the university
will be acquiring a set of
these percussion instuments
through the help of Rene
Lysloff, assistant professor of
music at Pitt.

Ery Kusuma P. Jaya, presi-
dent of the Indonesian
Students’ Association, said
Lysloff has been instrumental
to the acquisition of the
gamelan for the university.
Jaya also said that Lysloff
has contributed 2,000
Indonesian books to the
libraries at Pitt.

Jaya hoped that the night
would introduce Indonesian
culture to Pittsburgh and
raise the awareness of the
Indonesian populous that
exsists here.

According to Jaya, there
are about 150 Indonesian stu-
dents between Pitt, Carnegie
Mellon and Duquesne.

“We in America don’t
know enough about
Indonesia,” said Joseph J.
Zasloff, interim director of
the Asian studies program.

Zasloff also said thathe
was impressed by the “superb
organization” of the Asian
studies program and the work
done by Jaya in the arrange-
ment of the night. He also
said he was delighted by the
large turnout at the event.»

Sue Neff, a local elemen-

tary teacher anedvaudience

member, sponsors an oragami
club which focuses on Japan
and the art of paper. creations.

Neff, who is interested in
learning about other areas of
Southeast ‘Asia besides China
and Japan, said she hoped
that programs such as
Indonesian night will bring
greater exposure to the area,
especially to children and
students.

In his remarks, Lysloff,
also the master of cere-
monies, told of one of his
experiences in the country.
He had been looking for the
home of a musician and
asked a motorcyclist who was
stopped on the side of the
road for directions. Instead of
just telling Lysloff where to
go, the cyclist took him there.

“In Indonesia, the guest is
king,” Lysloff said.

not be sacrificed for budget
protection.”

This figure was cited in a
public opinion poll taken by
Public Opinion Research,
entitled “Financial Aid and
College Education.”

“Ninety-two percent of the
public believes that finan-
cial aid is investing in
America’s future,” Powell
said.

At Duquesne University,
approximately 80 percent of
the students received some
form of financial assistance
for the 1994-1995 school
year

Christine Devere, presi-
dent of the Chatham College
Student Government, said,
“Eighty-five percent of
Chatham’s students receive
financial aid. Sixty percent
receive funding through
campus programs such as
Supplemental Educational
Opportunity Grants, Perkins
Loans and Federal Work

Study.”

Campus Based Aid is
funded by the federal gov-
ernment. Each year partici-
pating schools are given a
set amount of money. The
schools then give the money
to the students through
Federal Work Study, Federal
Supplemental Educational
Opprotunity Grants and the
Federal Perkins Loan pro-
gram. FWS recieved the
same amount of funding in
1995 that it received in
1994. FSEOG and Perkins
Loans are currently in dan-
ger of being elimated.

Devere also expressed
concern over the elimination
of Americorps, which is not
a financial aid program _but
a federal community ser-
vice program for college
students. She said that the
number of students partici-
pating in community service
has increased, making many
community service organi-
zations possible.

Gina Schuyler, president

of the Carnegie Mellon
University student body,

-shared her own personal

story of how financial aid
has had an impact on her
life.

Schuyler comes from a
middle-income family and
has a younger brother and
sister still in high school.
This combination causes her
to rely on financial aid for
her education.

“If the proposed cuts
would have been made last
year, I would not have been
able to attend‘ Carnegie
Mellon this year,” said
Schuyler.

Patrice Nycole Walters, a
representative from the
Community College of
Allegheny County, stressed
the importance of financial
aid for community colleges
because of the varied and
sometimes disadvantaged
student body.

“For many community
college students, financial
aid not only pays for tuition,

books and fees, but it also
pays the rent, utilities and
puts food on the table,”
Walters said. “Financial aid
can be the difference
between falling through the
cracks or a person being
educated to help cement
those cracks shut.”

student frustration when
the printers are backed up,
files get lost or there are
no computers available.

“Last year it was hell,”
said sophomore consultant
Tom Meckey. “Students
were stressed out from the
wait. One girl had lost a
file when her computer
froze, and she lost all her
work. She broke into tears
right in front of me.”

Meckey said that since
the printers can be backed
up one to two hours during
peak times such as finals,
students should try to do
their work in advance.
Also, Meckey suggested
that all work should be fre-
quently backed up with a
floppy disk to avoid data
loss.

Hillman Library is usual-
ly a congested area during
peak times, because stu-
dents can do their research
and write papers in the
same building. Schatz said
that the university may use
a high-tech solution to this
problem.

“Presently, we are con-
sidering issuing out ‘ap-
tops with wireless technol-
ogy to students at Hillman.
They can use them in the
library, and they can con-
nect directly to the net-
work without using a desk-
top machine,” said Schatz.

Though the connection
would not be as fast as the
larger desktop machines,
Schatz said the speed
would be acceptable, and
the freedom to work would
make up for it.

For students who can
afford it, purchasing a
home computer can solve
all problems encountered
at the labs.

“I bought a computer and
printer to use at home,
because it is much more
convenient. I only use the

computers at school for e-
mail,” said undergraduate
Becky MacGregor.

Graduate student Liz
Crum also found the need
to buy her own computer.

“The reason I bought one
is to avoid the crowds
here. I’m under a time
constraint, and it’s too
hard to drive to school just
to use a computer,” said
Crum. _

Another complaint from
students is that the net-
work is too slow during
peak hours.

“Though the network can
run slowly with a lot of
users, we have Pentium
PCs as servers for the
DOS-based machines and
UNIX-based servers for
the Macintoshes. These are
high—end units that run
extremely fast,” said
Schatz.

Schatz said one speed-
restricting factor is the
actual computer. He said
that a slower, older com-
puter will not run as fast as
the new machines regard-
less of network speed.

“The problem here is no
different than any other
large university,” said
GSPIA student Dennis
Flaherty. “We have new
software running in old
machines. What we need is
newer hardware.”

Regardless of what hard-
ware is available. if a
majority of the students try
to use the labs at the same
time this year. Schatz said
Pitt could have a huge
problem.

“The main thing is cour-
tesy. Try and come to the
labs during the morning or
at night. Don’t send e—mail
when others are waiting in
line behind you. With
some consideration, we
won’t have a repeat of last
year.”

Opinions

Still turning the screw

We are honored today to welcome Vice President Al Gore
to the University of Pittsburgh. He has come here to speak
about pending cuts in federal student aid which, if they take
place, are potentially devastating to college students nation-
wide.

We are all very familiar (perhaps too familiar) with the
ever-growing prices of getting a college education. It would
be a certified miracle if we ever see a year begin here at Pitt
without a significant increase in tuition and fees. However,
though those numbers continually increase, the numbers
relating to available student aid stay the same.

According to federal guidelines, students are only eligible
to receive a certain amount of money each year. The money
may come from any combinationiof grants, loans and/or;
scholarships, but once you have reached your budget limit
you are not eligible for anything else (except private scholar-
ships). If you are lucky enough to win a scholarship of some
kind, don’t cheer too hard. Within a few weeks, you will
receive a letter stating that either your grants or your loans
have been reduced to balance your new font of wealth. I

But there is yet another way the government continues to
tighten the screws of life on students’ bank accounts. Any
financial aid you receive which exceeds the cost of tuition
and textbooks for the year is considered income. You are
required to claim this money on your income tax return and
pay taxes on it as such. Didn’t know that? Uncle Sam does,
and you can bet he’s watching to see if that $48.32 (which
somehow wasn't sucked into the abyss of the university) is
on your tax return. Never mind that you might have to pay
rent or the electric bill or (God forbid!) eat something other
than ramen noodles.

Next year’s proposed budget has even further slashes to
student aid in sight. According to the present plans, Pell ‘
grants will be frozen at this year’s maximum level — $2,340.
Subsidies for guaranteed Stafford student loans will be elimi-
nated, as will the entire Perkins loan program. The interest
exemption for graduate and professional students will be
revoked, and Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants
will be eliminated.

It is already difficult to finance a college education. Most
of us will graduate with some form of debt. If the price of
college continues to rise at its present rate, it will not be long
before a college education is inaccesible to everyone but the
wealthiest. While a balanced budget might be a good thing,
what is the point if no one is educated enough to take the
lead after this generation of government is gone?

Vice President Gore has come here today to speak about
the great importance of preventing these cuts from happen-
ing. We strongly support his efforts to inform students about
what they are facing, and we hope the campaign to continue
student aid is successful.

have seen a
growing acceptance of altema—
tive lifestyles, and while I
have some disagreements with
some of the actions of the gay
rights movement, on the whole
I consider this to be a very
good thing and a bit overdue.
However, there remains a
lifestyle choice which is still
struggling to find acceptance.
It is the non-exclusive choice:
polygamy, polyamory, panfi-
delity, whatever you want to
call it. It is the act of being
with, sleeping with and/or lov-
ing more than one. As some-
one who has lived a life of
openness for many years, I
think it’s about time we polys
had our say.
Riddle me this: why are
bachelor parties such a com-
mon ritual? Why is that ‘‘last

bit of freedom”_ so valuable?-

Why do people in couples
have arguments about whether
their relationship preclude:
them from “just looking”?
And why do so many people
end relationships either
because they found someone
else, or because they don’t
want to “settle down” just yet?
Why has the strain of multiple
relationships been so ubiqui-
tous when we presumably only
need one?

The reason is simple:
humans, by and large, never
stop wanting. Yet the one-mate
structure demands that we do,
which is impossible. Desires
cannot be controlled by any
social mandate. If a law were
passed tomorrow forever ban-
ning, say, homosexuality, it
could only be possibly fol-
lowed in physical practice, not
in the mind or heart. Similarly,
when we are going out with
someone, we don’t suddenly
stop finding others attractive,
nor do we stop wanting the
things that maybe our current
mate cannot give us. I choose
“polyamorous” instead of
“polygamous” for this reason:

you can affect who you sleep
with — you cannot affect who
you love, lust after or, in gen-
eral, just want.

The one-mate answer to this
dilemma is to chain the cat
inside, lest it not come back,
an illusory attempt to shield
your mate from other options.
The polyamorous response is
different: let the cat out. If it
comes back on its own, you
haven’t lost anything. If it
doesn’t, did it really want to be
there that badly in the first
place?

That is, I guess, the reason
that many are not
polyamorous: it takes a bit of
strength to let someone go and
watch the clock tick by, wait-
ing for them to come home. It
takes even more to follow
through with the above logic
and let someone “shop
around” for someone better
than you. But this isn’t an
issue of strength: this is an
issue of giving.

When I care about someone,
I want to give them whatever
makes them happy. Sometimes
what makes them happy is to
be with someone else. If I kept
them from that, I would be

going against what an ex of"

mine once told me —— that the
ideal relationship should only
open up possibilities, not
restrict them. If my love for
someone does not want me to
stop them from going to see
friends, working extra hours,
spending some time alone with
themselves or doing anything
else which they would have
wanted to do before they met
me, why should it also want
me to stop them from being
with someone else in the same
way that they would have
before they met me?

I understand the need for
security that drives the monog-
amous culture. From experi-
ence, however. I can respond

with this: the feeling of securi- ’

ty that you get when you and
your mate decide to “commit"
to one another is nothing com-
pared to the feeling of security

you get when the one you love
has your blessing to do what-
ever he/she wants, with
whomever he/she wants, and
given that, still comes back to
you. Commitments need not
be exclusive: I am committed
to many friends, groups, jobs
and beliefs. Committing
myself to just one lover, then,
I feel would be a double-stan-
dard. .

Many who don’t feel this
way will point out the many
problems that could arise in a
polyamorous relationship, and
I won’t disagree that there are
difficulties involved in this
sort of lifestyle: I’ve been
through them. These difficul-
ties, however, don’t stem from
polyamory being an incorrect
choice. They stem from the
fact that all relationships
(whether romantic, sexual,
friendly, familial or profes-
sional) require work. Human
desire is a demanding trait,
and coordinating the many
desires of many people, how-
ever you choose to do so, can
be a difficult task. It is unfair,
though, to say that polyamory
is the source of these prob-
lems. Show me one problem in
a multiple-partner relationship.
and I can show you a corre-
sponding one for a single-part-
ner relationship.

This doesn’t mean that 1
agree with some friends of
mine that “everyone is poly."
On the whole, I disagree with
just about every sentence that
starts with those two words.
What it means is that you must
choose your lifestyle depend-
ing on what suits your (and
your partner(s)’s) needs. I def-
initely don’t push this or any
lifestyle on anyone. But it does
pain me when my friend
comes to me, saying that he
doesn’t want to hurt his girl-
friend. but he really does want
to see what else is out there.
and he doesn’t know whatto
do. I have an answer for him.

Government gone bad

Today, Pitt students have a
rare opportunity to be present
at a live address by the Vice
President of the United
States. The subject matter, we
have been told, is one that
concerns every student
regardless of political lean-
ings: federal student aid.

Hence, this address present-
ed by the Vice President is
being sponsored by our
Student Government Board.
In fact, promoters of the Gore
speech today have gone out
of their way to reassure con-
servative. students, like
myself, that this is indeed a
non-partisan event —— going
so far as to request that the
College Republicans co—spon-
sor the event. (Can you imag-
ine the reaction if the
University Democrats were
asked to co—sponsor an event
on campus with Newt
Gingrich?)

It is not widely known, but
this “non-partisan” visit has
also been endorsed by the
Chancellor’s office. In fact,
many members of the Blue
and Gold Society were asked
to pass out literature promot-
ing the event at last

Saturday’s football game.

Even less known is that
University Maintenance has
been given a limitless budget
in order to prepare the cam-
pus for the Vice President’s
visit.

The problem with all this is
that this event is not non-par-
tisan. I can almost guarantee
you that references today will
be made as to “draconian cuts
in student aid by
Congressional Republicans.”
I wouldn’t be surprised if the
name of a Republican presi-
dential candidate or two
slipped out of the V.P.’s
mouth.

After all, Clinton began
running campaign commer-
cials two months ago. Is it so
far fetched to believe that
Gore will not use this oppor-
tunity to mobilize college stu-
dents behind his ticket? Or
perhaps I should say scare
college students into voting
Clinton/Gore (a la_ senior citi-
zens with Medicare, the poor
with welfare and parents with
school lunch.)

The abhorrent part is the
scam that the Chancellor’s
office and the SGB are trying
to carry out. Don’t be fooled.

Columnist hile

Matt I

Grove was
growing up,

my parents and grandpar-

‘ ents told me stories about

“the good old days.” You
know, when movies were a
nickel, sharing a soda with
two straws and living the

_ good life without having to

risk your own. Saturday
night I felt something that
I’m sure will last a long
time.

When the Pitt Panthers
took the field Saturday
night against Eastern
Michigan, most of the fans
thought it would be a
laugher. After Steve Clay
took’ the opening kickoff
93 yards for a touchdown,
no one was laughing any-
more. I thought that this
game was going to end up
just likethe majority of
Panther games have over
the last few seasons — in a

' ‘ loss.
Luckily Pitt bounced
back in huge fashion, and
it brought a tear to my eye.
- A sense of pride rushed
through me when we began
to run up the score like all
the great college teams do.
For a moment I felt
bad for EMU, but then I
came to my senses and
started pushing for 70
points. This Panther effort
brought back memories of
“the good old days,” at
least as far back as I can
remember. _
1984. The Olympics
were in L.A., The Karate
Kid hit the big screen and
the AFC won the Super
Bowl. Now-that was the
year. It was also the last
time the Panthers reached
60 points. Foge Fazio’s
squad beat Louisville that
year 63-14. Hmm, now I
remember.
Pitt finished the season a
dismal 3-7-1, but that is
irrelevant for one reason:
the Panthers beat Penn
State in Happy Valley, 31-
11. Two 5-5-1 seasons fol-
lowed, but the true fans
_ were still there.
Mike Gottfried came to
town in 1987, and things
began to look up. Pitt had
the best players its money
could buy, went to a bowl
game and once again beat
J oePa and the Nittany
Lions. That was the life.
1988 was an up and
down year for the
Panthers. Losses to West
Virginia and Boston
College were rough, but

Runaway victory
llmlefecﬂed Pil-I crushes EMU

By Mike Kovak
‘Asst. Sports Editor

The Pitt football team’s quest for a Fiesta Bowl bid took
another giant step in the right direction Saturday with a 66-30
dismantlement of the Eastern Michigan Eagles.

The Panthers (2-0), winners of their last five at home, dazzled
the crowd with 648 yards of total offense, including a
Pittsburgh Steeler-like 315 yards on the ground.

“Obviously, there were a lot of big plays,” EMU head coach
Rick Rasnick said. “We anticipated that. Their personnel over-

came our personnel.”

Pitt’s personnel did far more than overcome the EMU play-
ers. ‘Many questions were answered on Saturday.
The most pressing question was answered quickly and often.

Freshman sensation, and now a frontrunning Heisman candi- 

date, Demetrius Harris sliced through the Eagle defense for 62 

first—quarter yards.

After “Super Slick” Steve Clay returned the opening kickoff '
for a touchdown to put EMU up 7-0, Harris got the Panthers on :
the board with a l-yard touchdown run to tie the game at seven. ‘

“What surprised me was that coach [Majors] kept me in on '
the goal line. That got my confidence up,” Harris said.

On only 11 carries, Pitt’s newest superback gained 149 yards ‘
and scored, as columnist Matt Grove predicted, three touch-

downs.

No touchdown was more important than his second.

With the Panthers trailing EMU 17-10 after running back
Jerome Adams plunged through the Pitt defense for a 2-yard
touchdown, Harris and that other guy, Chris Patton, seized con-
trol of the game. Set up by three strong Patton carries, Harris
burst through the heart of the EMU defense for an electrifying
55-yard touchdown. After a Chris Ferencik PAT, the game was

tied at 17.

“It felt great being in college and going 55 yards,” Harris

said.

delight.”

With the super-duper performance by Harris, it is all too easy
to overlook the performances of Patton and fullback Vince

Williams.
Patton earned 53 yards on 12 carries,

The Pitt soccer team’s two-game win-
ning streak was snapped Saturday after-
noon by a 2-0 loss to the SUNY-Buffalo
Bulls.

The loss drops their record to 2-2 in
non-conference play.

For the Panthers, junior midfielder Eric
Kopay and freshman forward Drew Kopp
each registered three shots. The Panthers
combined for a total of nine shots, but
failed to capitalize on their scoring
opportunities.

For Buffalo it was another story.

Buffalo had no problem finding the
net. At the 22-minute mark, Buffalo’s
junior forward Ediru Okepewho scored
on a breakaway to give the Bulls a 1-0
lead.

Buffalo’s junior midfielder, Joe
Mercik, followed in Okepewho’s foot-
steps and scored at 50:25. Buffalo tallied
10 shots on goal, but only depended on
the two that resulted in goals to seal their
victory.

Despite the results, head coach Joe
Luxbacher said the team put forth a good
effort and played a solid game.

“They attacked well, they just didn’t
finish,” said Luxbacher, who watched his
team’s scoring efforts fall short of goals.

Midfielder Todd Graf (11) carries the
ball upfield.

Goal scoring seems to be the one area
where the team is in need of improve-
ment. 1

“We had good chances, we just
couldn’t put the ball in the net,”
Luxbacher said.

The team pulled together to play a

solid defensive game. Senior goalkeeper
Adam Spitzer came up big with five
saves.

But despite a great defensive effort, the
Panthers are still looking for that one
great offensive player to emerge as they
prepare for their first conference game.

Luxbacher said he will not make any
drastic changes for the next three confer-
ence games scheduled. He said the team
played their best game Saturday, minus
their lack of goals.

“That was their best effort so far. We’re
just not getting results,” Luxbacher said.
“The key for us is to get better every
game.” He said that right now the team is
getting revved up for the Big East.

Freshman Travis Kruse is getting ready
for Big East play a little sooner than
expected. When starting sweeper Mike
Mincin went out of Saturday’s game 50
seconds into the second half because of a
leg injury, Kruse was called upon to fill
the void.

“He played well,” said Luxbacher of
Kruse. “We have to get him ready for the
Big East.”

There was no word on Mincin’s condi-
tion. Whether he’ll play in Friday’s game
or not will depend on the x-ray results.

The Panthers travel to Providence on

Friday, Sept. '15, for their ﬁrst conference

game of the season.

player in EMU history to
break 300 yards in a single
game.

That game meant nothing in
Batch’s attempt to become the
Eagles’ top signal-caller. Rick
Rasnick was hired in January
after coach Ron Cooper
defected to Louisville.

One of the first things
Rasnick did was declare that
no position was secure going
into spring practice.

the incumbent, Armour, for
the starting job.

“In the spring we felt
Charlie Batch was a real nat-
ural for us,” Rasnick said.
“He’s very composed in the
pocket, has a great arm, really
what we’re looking for in
terms of our offensive style
and approach.

“Batch and Armour have
contrasting styles. Armour can
run the football a little better,
and Charlie has a better arm.”

In his first game of the sea-
son and first career start,
Batch scorched the Akron
Zips’ secondary for 18 com-
pletions in 31 attempts, 218
yards and three touchdowns.

_ In his second career start
Batch faced a much better
defense, one that held
Washington State to 316 total
yards.

He went 21 for 38 for 264
against a noticeably unhealthy
secondary. The Panthers were

Panthers

‘from page 14

everybody who knows some-
thing about Panther football by
scoring two touchdowns and
rushing for 47 yards on 13 car-
ries.

At least for a day or three,
Billy West is a forgotten man.

“Our offense did a wonder-
ful job. Players picked up the
slack,” Majors said. “I am very
happy‘ with the way we used
Harris and Patton tonight.”

“We did a good job,” Harris
said. “Patton has the power;
me, I’m more fast.”

Although they are not quite
the tandem of Barn Morris and
Erric Pegram, they were pretty
damn close.

After the Panthers tied the
contest with 11:39 remaining
in the second quarter, the rest
of the game was dominated by
Pitt.

On the first play of Pitt’s
next possession, the college
rotisserie league’s most desired
quarterback, John Ryan, con-

nected with Dietrich Jells on a 7

66-yard touchdown pass. Pitt
24 — EMU 17.

On Pitt’s next possession,
highlighted by a 50-yard Ryan-
to-Jells strike, Ryan found a
wide-open Chris Schneider for
a 10-yard touchdown pass to
cap off an impressive 91-yard
drive that lasted only seven
plays. Pitt 31 — EMU 17.

“When you look out there
and see man-to-man coverage,
you just get a big smile,” Ryan
said.

“Ryan was steady and had
great leadership. He threw to
what was there. They covered
our receivers man-to-man all
game,” Majors said.

Ryan completed 13 of 21
passes for 288 yards and three
touchdowns with no intercep-
tions.

Jells continued a superb
1995 season with four recep-
tions for 134 yards and two
more touchdowns. Walk-on
turned scholarship player
Sadiq Durham continued his
dream season with four catch-
es for 60 yards and a blocked.
punt. Mark Butler got in on
three catches for 89 yards.

“We had a lot of good bal-
ance overall,” Majors said.

“The key was to establish
the run, then go from there,”
Jells said.

On Pitt’s last possession of
the first half, Ryan once again
found Jells in the end zone on
a seven—yard completion with
52 seconds remaining. The

score at halftime: Pitt 38 —.

EMU 17.

At the half, Harris had
already amassed 117 yards on
nine carries. Jells had 134
yards receiving, and Nate
Cochran had one punt for a
not-so-Ray Guy-like 41 yards.
The offense accumulated 420
first-half yards.

Pitt opened up the second
half with the ball, and for the
fourth consecutive time the
driveended with someone hit-
ting paydirt.

For the third time Saturday,
Harris found his way to the

- - . . . « -

. \ . . . . ' v I ‘ ‘ . _ - ,

end zone on a three-yard
touchdown. The drive was
highlighted by a 29-yard
Harris carry and a 32-yard
Ryan to Butler hook—up. With
11:30 remaining in the third
quarter, Pitt 45 — EMU 17.

“Harris has really stepped it
up. I’m really surprised,” Ryan
said. .

Obviously, not as surprised
as Harris.

“I never thought that I was
going to get playing time this
year, Harris said. “I was able to
do some stuff with some great
blocking by the offensive line-
men.”

After the touchdown, the
evening drew to a close for the
runner, and Vince “The Pizza
Smasher” Williams took over.

After a Williams fumble,
“The Pizza Smasher”
regrouped on Pitt’s next series
by setting up a six—yard touch-
down pass to former Miami
Dolphin tight-end Keith
Jackson.

There had to be a few
recruiting violations to land
that guy. Pitt 52 — EMU 17.

After an EMU fumble on the
ensuing kickoff, Williams
reached the promised land on a
five-yard carry around the

right end. Pitt 59 —— EMU 17.

Even if you’re not a math
major, simple addition shows
that the Panthers scored 49
unanswered points.

Williams capped off the
Panther scoring when he ran
up the gut for four yards to
give the Panthers a 66-23 lead.

In additional statistics,
Cochran punted the pigskin
three times for a 42.6 average.

This did not please Guy, his
mentor.

The Panthers’ final touch-
down gave them the most
points since the 1977 Panthers
humiliated Temple 77-0. It also
marked the highest combined
point total in a Panther game
since 1965, when the West
Virginia Mountaineers defeat-
ed our Panthers 63-48.

“Their perimeter people are

as good as anybody’s,”
Rasnick said. “Their team
speed is outstanding.”

It will take a lot more than
team speed when the Panthers
travel down to Texas to face
the Top 25 Longhorns. A

“It’s nice going down to
Texas 2-0,” Ryan said. '

“We’ll have to play extreme-

ly well to win next week," »

Majors said.

again. Pitt 14 —— Penn State
7. Curvin Richards rushed
for 1,228 yards that year,
and Darnell Dickerson was
big man on campus. People
were primed forA‘89.
The‘Panthers were 5-0-1
going into the Notre Dame
game in South Bend. Pitt
was routed by the Irish, 45-
7, and again the next week
by Miami, 24-3. ’
Gottfried was on the hot
seat, but the Panthers
responded. Pitt won two of
the next three to finish the

- regular season 7-3-1. It was

off to El Paso and a date
with Texas A&M in the
John Hancock Bowl. Mike
Gottfried stepped down as
head coach prior to the
game, and Paul Hackett
was named to replace him
only hours before kickoff.
Pitt rallied behind

- Hackett and beat the

Aggies 31-28 in a come-

back to remember. Alex
Van Pelt hooked up with
Henry Tuten from 44 yards
out with 2:19 left for the
win. Van Pelt threw for 354
yards on the day and was
named MVP.

Since that victory, Pitt
has had only one winning
season. In 1991 the
Panthers went 6-5 but lost
to Penn State in the season
finale. There is nothing
worse than growing up a
Pitt fan in Penn State coun-
try.

Over the next three years,
the_Panthers won three
games each year. Only
three games. 1992 may
have been the lowest point
for Pitt football.

Blowout losses to WVU,
Notre Dame, Penn State
and Hawaii set the tone for
an embarrassing 1993 in
which Pitt was outscored
371-168 on the year. What
was happening to this pro-

gram that was once a
national power?

The 1994 season was bet-
ter for the Panthers statisti-
cally, but 3-8 was again the
best they could muster.
That was on paper, but peo-
ple forgot the close games
against Texas, Louisville,
WVU and even Miami.

If those games go the
other way, Pitt is 7-4 and
going to the Poulan
Weedeater Bowl. The 1994
year left a bad taste in
many mouths, but prepara-
tion began for 1995.

When the ‘95 Panthers
roared through the new
players’ tunnel in the open-
er against Washington
State, the feeling was there.
A fourth quarter comeback
was just what the Pitt faith-
ful needed to conjure up
those feelings of “the good
old days.”

Steve Clay of EMU did a
great job of taking the wind

out of the early—season
sails with his kickoff
return. The Panthers of
recent memory would have
laid down and played dead,
but not these men.
John Ryan and company

came back with a
vengeance and did what

was needed to regain their -

confidence: score as many
points as possible regard-
less of the opponent. It
worked.

The usual stars came out
on Saturday when Ryan and
Jells hooked up for two
scores, but the night

~ belonged to the future of

the Panthers: freshman
Demetrius Harris.

Harris carried the ball
only 11 times, but he
gained 149 yards and
scored three times in only
three quarters of play.
Harris did all of this in
front of his idol, former
Pitt star Tony Dorsett.

After scoring his final
TD, Harris made his way to
the sidelines, and that is
when he saw his idol.

Harris commented, “I was
thanking the line for open-
ing up holes big enough for
a truck to run through, and
I was like, ‘Wow, there’s
Dorsett.’ He told me good
running and keep it up.”

The Panthers travel to
No. 15 Texas next week for
their first real test, but the
feeling is there. It is in the
crowd. It is in the coach. It
is in the players. Pitt foot-
ball is on its way back up.
Anyone who calls himself
or herself a Pitt fan can
feel it.

Take advantage of what
Pitt football has to offer,
and you too will have sto-
ries to pass on about “the
good old days.”

Writer for The Pitt News.

missing cornerback
Denorse Mosely with an
ankle injury. The other cor-
nerback, Anthony Dorsett,
suffered a hip pointer in the
second quarter and was
used sparingly after that.

“I think Charlie Batch did
a nice job. The offensive
line kept people off him,”
Rasnick said. “He was very
accurate with his throwing,
but [the receivers] dropped
some passes early in the
game.”

When the game was out
of reach in the second half,
Armour replaced Batch, and
completed six of nine
attempts for 103 yards.

But after the game,
Rasnick said Batch is still
the starting quarterback.

“There’s no question
about it. Armour dida nice
job today, but he was going
against their twos and
threes. Charlie Batch is our
quarterback,” Rasnick said.

Although it took four
years to play in his home-
town, Batch can’t be disap-
pointed with his showing.
