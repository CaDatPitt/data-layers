Hearig Postponed,
Witness In Hospital

V
;

By MARK A. SINDLER

The hearing for two Pittfootball
players accused of assaulting a
woman police officer was postponed
Wednesday amid a shouting match
between a defense attorney and the
presiding judge.

The hearing was postponed after
the police asked for a continuance,
as one of the witnesses,,injured poli-
cewoman DeVelma Coleman, was
still in the hospital.

Linebackers Dennis Atiyeh and
Dave Puzzuoli were a-rrested on
Forbes Ave. near Bouquet St. on

‘Feb. 20 because of an incident that _

arose as a result of Puzzuoli’s being
asked to leave the area.'When Puz-
zuoli ‘was asked by city police to
leave for athird time, Atiyeh stopped

his car and investigated the’

disturbance.

Later, both were arrested on var-
ious charges, including assaulting
and seriously injuring a.policewo-
man. Other‘ charges were resisting
arrest, simple assault, terroristic
threats, aggravated assault,
obstructing traffic and disorderly‘
conducts. Both were known to e

‘r heavily intoxicated.
Sam Sciullo, the attorney repres- .-

enting Atiyeh, was informed ‘of the
postponement by Judge Donna Jo’
McDaniel on Tuesday. She asked
that Sciullo appear at City court at 3
p.m., Wednesday, instead of l p.m.,

‘ so that the proper postponement»

form could be completed.

After notifyng Atiyeh and_ Puz-
zuoli’s attorney, Ray Radakovich,
Scuillo received a call from a court
clerk informing him that he would
have to arrive at 2 p.m. Sciullo said
ithis was imposssible since a court
.reporter-—needed to record court-

room testimony—could not be sum-
___mone_d on such short notice.

“I had a hunch there’d be a hear-
ing,” Sciullo said. “But after I called
Ray [who hadn’t even been notified
of the new time], he called the court,
got back to me and said there would

be no hearing but that they wanted’
us down there early since [the clerks]
ﬁnished, early that day.”

When Sciullo arrived with Rada-
kovich and their clients, the original
1 p.m. postponement was already in
effect, but Judge McDaniel had
been replaced by Judge Walter
Little. I ’

“I got there and I saw all those
police officers waiting around down

there, and I thought, ‘Uh-oh, these I

guys are going to try and ram a
quickie down our throats, in the
form of a hearing.’—”*Sciullo recalled.
“I then asked Little that we move for
a" continuance. He said, ‘What for?’
He didn’t want to hear the prosecu-
tor’s continuance.”

Sciullo continued, “Well, we got
into it back-and-forthisayin i in
that he didn’t know what the lgiell he
was talking about. They were going

' to have a_qu_ickie hearing, andl

‘  ii :.:o;-.:..Tt:¢‘.Pitt

: wasn’t going to let it happen. I told
[Little] he was running a kangaroo
court, and that was the end of it.

; “He relented and said to the dis-
trict attorney, ‘What do you think?’
There was no objection; but, that’s
what he should have asked 20 min-
utes before, and we would have
' avoided all the arguing.”

Both Sciullo and Radakovich said
it would have been impossible to
hold a fair hearing since neither
attorney had his witnesses present
and, both were just complying “with
the formalities" of filling out post-
ponement documents. * Radakovich
explained that matters would ‘have
been resolved more diplomatically
had Judge McDaniel appeared.

» “Little took the bench, and he just
wanted to railroad us and have a

hearing,” Radakovich said. “Ithink

~Sam got. rather upset and ‘started
screaming because ‘he thought he
was being railroaded. There were
some ,nasty remarks coming from
the judge and [he] actually..._.critic-
ized Mr. Sciullo and [he]-..really

'shouldn’t have. I »

“Mr. Sciullo was 150 percent
right,” Radakovich added.

With national unemployment
rates reaching all-time highs,
employment agencies might as
well post going-out-of-business
signs.

Placement studies indicate

. that relevant experience is even
more important than grades'in
employers’ decisions to hire new
college graduates. An excellent
method for getting that expe-
rience is by serving an internship.

However, budget cuts have
forced Dr. Robert Gallagher, of
the Career Counseling Center,
and the Student Affairs Office to
drop Pitt’s Internship Ofﬁce as
of ‘June 30, 1983, adding yet
another name—Nancy Denhart,
Internship Office coordinator—
of jobless Americans.

Rich Cook, a Pitt graduate

who served an internship at

- KDKA Radio, is now a full-time
employee there.

“It [the internship] gave me an
opportunity to see how a radio
station in a major market oper-
ates,” Cook said. “It’s a situation

' that just can’t be simulated in a
‘classroom. The internship pro-
gram enabled me to work in it. It

not only gave me experience, it
increased my chances of being
hired.” [Cook] was hired as part-
time,
became a full-time employee.

Internships will still be accessi- -

ble to Pitt students, but acquir-

ing them may not be as easy,” .

Denhart ‘said. Many internship
programs require that students

._ have a designated liaison to

whom the organization sponsor-
ing the internship has access in
order to provide information
concerning the program.

This is especially true of

, government internships. Den-

hart said the loss of this service

could possibly end them for Pitt ’

students.

Denhart and the advisers in '

the Internship Office not only
help students determine for
which internships they qualify
but assist them in defining their
career goals. This is a time-
consuming effort and requires
informed individuals.

According to Denhart, about
400 students used the office's ser-

vices last term, and nearly 250'

have done so this term. Of them,
many needed the assistance of
the advisers. e

and after two years,‘

In ternship Office Cut 

Who will pick up the slack
after the office is terminated?
Denhart is unsure. She said that
the advisers in the various
departments might possibly take
charge.

“The final decision will be
made by the administration,” she
said. “However, a help-yourself
booklet is in the making that will
list organizations and the pro-
grams they offer.”

Gallagher, who established the
office, said no plans have been
made yet, but a lot of work will
be done in the next few months in
an effort to combine the resour-
ces of other university offices as a
replacement for those of the
office.

Gallagher said he started the
program because no other part
of the university was handling it.

In 1976, he proposed a co-op
program in which students were
required to work off campus for
two terms. Co-op programs, by
meeting special requirements,
are eligible for funding -from the
federal government.

_The program failed, however,
because academic requirements
at Pitt made it difficult for stu-

Rape
Hearing
Waived

By BRIAN BALK

The rape case involving two Pitt
students was waived to the criminal
court at yesterday's preliminary
hearing in the Public Safety
Building.

Juniors Greg Eastman and James
Little, residents of Forbes Hall, were
arrested and charged with rape and
other offenses this weekend.

According to a Pittsburgh public

defender, the case will be heard in '

criminal court within the next two or

‘ three months. . -I

Since the alleged crime occurred
only six days ago, both defense and
prosecution may not have had

enough time to examine all the facts. '
“I think it was in their best advan- I

tage to wait until a later date to pos-
ture a better defense and review the

~. physical evidence that we have,"
V Lieutenant James Watters of the _
vcarn_pus_ police said.

The preliminary court hearing
yesterday was to determine all the

“prima facie" evidence to justify the '

charges brought against Eastman
and Little. Then the magistrate

could either bind or dismiss the case;

‘Eastman and Little were arrested
early Saturday morning by the-cam-

“ pus police. Both students were seen

earlier that night at a party on the
third floor of Forbes Hall.

According to Watters, both of the
students did not appear to be intoxi-
cated at the time of the arrest.

The campus police are currently
investigating the alleged crime for
additional evidence. But none of the
evidence can be released at this time.

“The campus police has all the
physical evidence of the incident
under legal council until it is heard in
court,” Watters said. '

@”No Loan Service Charge Forseen In PittFuture

~ )2

By COLETTE FERRIS

The _Guaranteed Student Loan
(GSL) is one of the principle options
chosen by thousands of college stu-
dcltts today to helpfgisiance what has
turned out to be a costly endeavor-
a college education. . .

The GSL was once a free service,
allowing -the student to go to the
commercial lender of his choice
(bank, savings and loan or credit
union) and recieve a loan on the

basis of his ﬁnancial need. From‘«

there, the funding is in the hands of
the college, the federal government
and the state loan agencies.

The question is, “will the service
remain free of charge?”

.-

According to some college offi-
cials, a service fee will have to be
installed because the federal govern-
ment is issuing stringent restrictions
not only on the basis of ﬁnancial
need, but academic qualifications as
well.

Pitt students, however, can rest
assured, Sue" McColloch, college
financial aid official, said. “It is
highly unlikely that not only Pitt,
but the majority of colleges, will’
institute this service charge.”

Pitt alone (has) approximately

- 10,000 students participating in the

GSL program. McColloch believes
that passing the buck on to the stu-

_ dent is not the solution.

President Elected

continued from page one_
Grossman, a previous RSA ﬂoor
representative and currently a
member of the executive board, has
already begun setting expectations
for next year. '

“I don’t feel that RSA is recog-
nized for a lot of the things we do,”
he said. “I hope to get more involve-;
merit within RSA.”

Grossman also said he hopes to
get more Student Government
Board funding and have more of a
“say” with the administration.

“I would like to make RSA all
that it could be,” Grossman said.

Grossman will be working with
Jay Nalli, the current RSA presi-
dent, for the next few months. He

will officially take over the office of
president in September.

“They purposely made the elec-
tions earlier so that the new officers.
can work together and get to know
their roles better,” Grossman said.

This year’s elections were run
poorly, according to Nalli. Rules
were not enforced in this year’s elec-
tions, Grossman said. »

“We are already in the process of
making new rules for next year’s
elections,” Grossman said.

Grossman is a pre-med major and
is a member of the varsity tennis
team and the Judicial Board.

Although students in the work-
study program are qualified to han-
dle the additional GSL paperwork,
McColloch said that the students
financial need, as well as his grades,
is confidential and cannot be dis-
closed. Thus, the processing of the
GSLs will be limited to the financial
aid office’s full-time employees.

As a result of the federal govern-
ment's intense research last October

concerning a family’s actual finan-
cial need, those involved in the GSL
process have noticed a considerable
increase in the amountof paperwork
and red tape. .

It is presently difficult to under-
stand exactly where the federal
government fits into the lending pro-
cess. While the commercial lender
issues the loan through the state

agency, the federal government
oversees the interest and subsidizes
the commercial agency.

‘‘I strongly encourage students
who are eligible to apply for a GSL
to do so as early as possible, say
April for instance, with the under-
standing that the entire process may
‘take awhile longer with this addi-

tional paperwork,” McColloch said.

Princess
Honored

Her Serene Highness Princess
Caroline of Monaco will be in
attendance at a special presenta-
tion by the International Poetry
Forum honoring the late Prin-
cess Grace on March 25 at 8 p.m.
in Carnegie Music Hall.

The memorial tribute is
entitled “This Wooden D: Sha-
kespeare and All That Jazz” and
stars John Dankworth, Cleo_
Laine, Beatrice Straight and
Michael York. Actor-director
Sam Wanamaker and Forum
director Samuel Hazo will nar-
rate the presentation.

Featuring dramatic readings
from the plays and poetry of
Shakespeare, the program will
be interspersed with poems by
contemporary British and Amer-
ican poets on themes suggested
by, or related to, Shakespeare.
Also included will be selections
from Shakespeare with jazz
accompaniment.

Ticket prices range from $7 to
$30 and can be obtained by cal-
ling the International Poetry
Forum.

Players’Hearing Postponed

continued from page one

Radakovich was concerned that

P “the screaming and shouting” and

“name-calling” would hurt Puzzuo-
li’s chances for a fair hearing. He
said Judge Littlehad expressed a
dislike of the co-council [Sciullo]
and that the prejudice would possi-
bly rub of on Puzzuo1i’s case.

Judge Little, after yesterday's

incident, disqualified himself from_

the football players’ case. Radako-

vich still acknowledges, though, that I
the damage may already have been

inflicted. q ‘
“That incident has tainted me so
badly about that court-—it was so
gross and bad,” Radakovich said.
“To say that Mr. Sciullo was a dis-
grace was mind-boggling to me, and
I felt that I would...consider what to
do in light of that kind of remark
coming from the bench‘.
_ -“I don’t know if it’s possible to
have a fair trial." \
Sciullo does not believe that his
case has been hurt by yesterday's
affair. He did, however, make a spe-
cial request to chief magistrate Alan
Penkower. Sciullo asked" him to

that may arouse undue publicity.

Penkower did move the hearing,
to be held Wednesday, March 9 at l
jp.m., to Traffic Court on the fourth

(PSB).

Sciullo does not like the accom-
modations provided by the City
Court, located in the PSB. He said,
“Down there at the mezzanine level,
it’s like a Chinese restaurant; people
are constantly going back and

\ forth—it’s so undignified, and you
can’t concentrate.”

  

This is a listing of crimes that-
have occurred on campus during
the past several days:

Feb. 22: Two female staff
members left their office door in
the LRDC’ Building unlocked
during the course of the day, and
someone took money from their
purses. The purses were not
taken. '

Feb.‘ 24: A female staff
member had her wallet stolen
from an office on the 10th floor
of the WPIC Building.

Feb. 25: At approximately
4:37 a.m., campus police disco-
vered that someone had spray-

near a Fifth Ave. entrance.
Above the bird was painted
“Thunderchicken.” Physical
plant crews were called after-
ward to erase the scrawling.

Feb. 25: A male student on the
12th floor of Tower B claimed

. that while he was painting his

room, someone walked into the

Campus Crime

room and took his wallet. His

Feb. 25: A female student liv-..
ing on the eighth floor of H01-
land Hall claimed "she was the

apprehended the individual, the
victim refused to press charges.

Feb. 26: A male individual
was apprehended in the K-Lot
and charged with prowling at,
night and found to be in viola-
tion of a city ordinance for carry- .
ing a concealed weapon—a large

Feb. 26: A male individual
was cited for becoming disor-
derly after a campus police
officer asked the man to move his
car, which was parked in a ﬁre

After the male became loud and
disorderly, he was issued a traffic
citation and released.

Feb. 27: ‘ Another male was
cited for disorderly conduct after
he was asked to move his car
from the same fire lane. He tore
down a police barricade to park
there; he was later transported by
campus police to the Public
Safety Building, downtown.

Feb. 28: A female student on
the 13th floor of Tower A
reported harrassment by com-
munication through both phone
calls and the mail. Someone has
been sending out letters with her
name on them.

Mar. I: It was reported that
sometime between Feb. 24 and
March 1, a male student had his
locker. broken into on the third

floor of Benedum Hall. The cul- ~

prit removed the lock, some light
electrical wire, a computer chip,
an AD converter, a DA conver-.
ter and several binary counters.

  Reagan’s

\

   Doubletalk  

Students of doubletalk take note. The Reagan
administration is giving lessons on Capitol Hill. The

subject is El Salvador.

On the one hand, Reagan insists that El Salvador be
governed by the group most supported by the people.
That’s the democratic thing to say, of course; let the
people decide. Unfortunately, knowing what the peo-
ple in El Salvador want today is almost impossible.

The State Department confidently asserts that the
leftist rebels don’t speak for the people. After all, the
government against which they fight was only recently

voted into power.

To accept these elections as an accurate expression
of the popular will is, however, very naive. The role
that fear—whether of leftist‘or rightist death squads-
played in that vote, while it cannot be accurately mea-
sured, cannot be so simply ignored. It is equally
probable that the Reagan-backed regime represents
no more people than the rebels.

Now the administration argues that the rebels
should be opposed, even if many Salvadorans accept
-their aims, because they seek to achieve their goals
through violence. Here is the doubletalk, for with no
reliable assurance that the Salvadoran government is
the peoples’ choice, Reagan’s other hand is asking
Congess to provide them with more tools to frustrate

the rebels through violence.

What are Americans to conclude from the double-
talk? If Reagan is only concerned to oppose leftist
governments in Central America, then his talk of peo-
ple’s governments is merely a smokescreen. Even if the
U.S. public cannot see through the smoke, Central
American publics almost certainly will, and the result
of Reagan’s policies would be more violence, not

democratic peace.

If the administration is truly.concerned with having
the popular will prevail in El Salvador, it must see that
more military aid is not the answer. As long as the

a people’s words can be controlled by the barrel of a
gun—whether that gun be held by government or rebel
troops—genuine public sentiments ‘cannot emerge in

peaceful discussions.

Reagan’s call for more military aid is not a call for
peace. Yet, before any positive action can be taken in
El Salvador to install and secure a popular govern-

ment, peace must prevail.

Letters To The Editor

Dear Editor:

I noticed that there weren’t any
responses to the letter written by
some anonymous author (Jan. 25)
about the recent NCAA ruling, so I
decided to write one of my own.

The letter said, “If one doesn’t
utilize one’s academic abilities as
well as one’s athletic abilities, then
one will be only half of a well-
rounded student.” But without this
ruling [which set minimum SAT or
ACT scores a student must achieve
to be eligible for NCAA competition
—Ed.], athletically inclined black
college students would still be get-
ting cheated out of an education by
their schools.

End Abortion Controversy

Dear Editor:

I recentlyread an article on abor-
tion in The Pitt News, and I would
like to_express my opinion on this
controversial issue. My view on

abortion is that the controversy.

between pro-life and pro-choice
groups has lasted long enough-. The
public has demonstrated that it does
not want the law changed.

The fact of the matter remains
that the Supreme Court has given
the choice to the women, and this
landmark decision has withstood
the test of timeand controversy. The
pro-choice and pro-life supporters
have stated their cases to the Ameri-
can people. The American people

have agreed with the Supreme Court _

decision.

The highly vocal pro-life groups
have distorted the desires of the
majority of Americans—that is, to
give women the right to choose.
Instead, these women have been
threatened by pro-life groups, which
has caused many women to develop
permanent emotional problems.

Further support is given to my
opinion from the League of Women
Voters—a reflection of public
opinion—which declared its support
for the right of American women to
have an abortion. The decision by
the ll0,000 league board members
came after the pro-choice position
earned a high level of support from
league members all over the country.

The controversy between pro-life
and pro-choice should come to an

- fend b,ecaruse.i_—1‘0, years of controversy 

Isn't it about time enough respon-
sible people put pressure on the
NCAA to set up some kind of min-
imum academic requirements for
freshmen athletes? If colleges accept
and deny non-athletic applicants on
the basis of their SAT and /-or ACT
scores, why should athletes be any
different? It would seem that scoring
a 700 on the SAT shouldn’t be hard
to do—even for a below-average
high school graduate—since you
score 400 pointsjust by signing your
name. -

Creighton University’s black bas-

ketball star Kevin Ross’ spent four
years at Creighton without even

learning how to read; now this "

‘has caused nothing to change the
Supreme Court decision. The debate
should stop, and the opinion of the
Supreme Court and the American
people who approved abortion as
legal should be affirmed.

Legalize Gambling?

Dear Editor:

Did you know that state legisla-
tors are considering legalizing gam-
bling in Pennsylvania? '

Gambling is a growing problem
that seems to be plaguing our
society. According to ‘the Johns
Hopkins University Compulsive
Gambling Counseling Center,
“Gambling over the last decade has
increased in the number of occa-
sional gamblers and has doubled in
the number of compulsive
gamblers." The center estimates that.
there are six to nine million men and
women in the United States today,
who are gambling addicts. This
number will increase if gambling is
legalized in Pennsylvania.

riages, finances and health. Gam- I

personalities in terms of what comes
first in life.

versity, “a compulsive gambler costs

Letter To The Editor

Law And lllloralit

Dear Editor:

In the precarious position of opinions edi-
tor, it is generally my policy not to respond
in print to letters we receive. I was overjoyed,
however,- that Sean Fitzpatrick (March 2,
1983) took the time to challenge some of the
ideas we presented in an editorial concerning
government-funded family planning clinics.
So I will thank Mr. Fitzpatrick for his letter
and proceed to rush in where angels fear to
tread.

It is certainly true that government, by‘

inaction, can in effect promote a particular
moral position. And in this case, by failing to
require federally-funded clinics to bring par-
ents into the family-planning process where
their children are concerned, the govern-
ment (if not promoting it) at least allows it to

be the case that government, andinot the ‘

family, inﬂuences this particular aspect of a
minor’s moral education. This point I will
grant, but I would argue that it is not the

only relevant point‘to be considered -by the \

law.

First of all, I believe (although the rest of
the editorial board here may disagree) that
the editorial was asserting a conditional
statement; something like “if it is a valid aim
of government to minimize the incidence of
unwanted teenage pregnancies, then it
would very likely defeat that aim of govern-
ment to impose a fsqueal rule.’ ” Because I
think the editorial adequately supports that
conditional and because I don’t think that
Fitzpatrick’s letter disputes this point, I will
not argue further for it here.

Now anyone could dispute that it is, in
fact,‘ a valid aim of government to minimize
unwanted teenage pregnancy, but I think a
good argument can be‘ made that it is. To
begin, I would agree that it seems proper (in
a moral sense) to place with parents the
responsibility for overseeing their children’s

' behavior and moral education. This is one of

the most fundamental moral beliefs in our
society.

Fitzpatrick, however, claims that this

responsibility entails that parents also have a
right (and, he implies, an exclusive right) to
oversee the activities of their children. But

Y

this claim is based on a misunderstanding of
the term “responsibility” as it is used here.
For, while it- is the case that parents have
responsibility for their children in that they
ought to oversee their activities, and that-
when they do this successfully, no one ought
to interfere with them, it is certainly not true
that all responsibility for a child's activity, in
the sense of paying for the consequences of
that activity, falls only upon the child’s
parents. .

In the case of unwanted teenage preg— A

nancy this is especially clear, for often
society—the taxpayer, if you will—ends up
picking up the tab for both mother and child
in these circumstances, and we cannot disre-
gard the physical or psychological harm that
may befall the unwanted child simply
because it is unwanted.

so in addition to parents, we must con-
sider that the child and society as well may
be responsible for—may stand to lose
from—unwanted teenage pregnancies. And
it is another fundamental principle in our
society that the law may step in to preventan
individual from bringing harm to another.
For these reasons, then, I believe that it is a
legitimate goal of government to minimize
unwanted teenage pregnancies.

There are still problems left; points that
Fitzpatrick~—or anyone,'for that matter—
might raise. Most of them are questions of
fact. Is it true, for example, that the exist-
ence of a “squeal rule” would scare young
women away from family-planning help?
Can family-planning help really reduce the
incidence of teenage pregnancy? Do any
individuals or groups aside from parents
actually stand to lose from instances of
unwanted teenage pregnancy?

I am not sure of the answers to any of
these questions, but I am reasonably conﬁ-
dent that the answer to each is “yes.” And
there may be other problems with the argu-
ment of which I am» not aware. But most
importantly, I do not offer this letter to close
debate on the subject, rather, to encourage

-more. Keep those cards and letters coming!

British royalty has been getting plenty of

Ian Campbell, professor of biology, said,
“No, I could use more. I haven't heard

FYI: Privacy Rights

The following information has been
excerpted from an American Civil Liber-
ties Union (A CL U)~ handbook, “Your
Rights to Privacy "by Trudy’Hayden and
Jack Navik.

Q. Do students have a right to see their
own school records?

A. Yes, if a student is either eighteen
years old or attends college, university, or.
other postsecondary institutions, and if
the school he attends receives any federal
money from the U.S. Office of Educa-
tion. Such a student’s right of access is
provided by a federal statute enacted in
1974, the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act (FERPA), known also as the
Buckley Amendment. ‘

The rights of access and other rights
conferred by FERPA do not apply to
students at private institutions. Nor do
they apply to students at schools receiv-
ing allkinds of federal aid. Only schools
that get federal funds through a program
administered by the U. S. Commissioner
of Education are obligated to comply
with FERPA.

Q. Should people assume that their
bank records are conﬁdential?

A. No. Despite a common impression
to the contrary, the records maintained
by banks, describing financial affairs of a

‘expectation of privacy" in his bank

customer—deposits, ‘ withdrawals,
checks, loans, and so on——do not
“belong” to the customer. According to a
1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, these
records are merely the records of com-
mercial transactions, not confidential
communications, and they “belong” to
the bank, not to the customer. For these
reasons, said the Court, a bank customer
has no constitutionally “legitimate

records, and no legal “standing” to pre-
vent the bank from revealing the records
to others. .

However, most Pennsylvania banks
will not disclose financial information to
a third party without prior notification to
the customer unless the bank is directed
to do so by a subpoena from a court or
government agency. -

Q. Do people have a right to see their
own arrest and conviction records?

A. Yes. A person’s access to his own
criminal-justice records is governed by
federal and state regulations, and in some
states, by statutes.

tion concerning South Africa,” senior Carla
Pettus said. “I have noticed more coverage
since Prince Charles and Di got married.”

She also said that before the election of
Reagan, there wasn’t as much coverage of
the monarchy. Now, there may be more cov-
erage because the U.S. government is trying
to become more united with England. ‘‘I
have come to no real conclusion whether it
[press coverage] is good, bad or otherwise,”
Pettus said.

Renee Martin-Negle,-a second-year law
student, said, “In my opinion, there isn’t
much more coverage given to the British
monarchy than other heads of nations, even
though the British monarchy can be consid-
ered more of celebrity status than govern-
mental status. I feel that the coverage is
proportionate.”

Abdula El-Rwaili said the reason there is
so much coverage by the press is the compe-
tition between news networks. He said that

ple. “It is important for people to know
about things that happen in the world,” El-
Rwaili said.

“In a way, I think they play up-British

royalty,” senior Kent Fairfax said. “British
royalty is just a figurehead, and I don’t see

any importance in what they do. Prince =

Is Vandalism a Problem at Pitt?

By WES .COTTER

Vandalism is a problem that can
easily be seen most anywhere on
campus. Graffiti, broken bathroom

nr fixtures, and other types of destruc-

tion cost the university a great deal
of money each year.

Vandalism at Pitt is not serious,
but it is acontinuing battle for the
administration.

The amount of destruction, both
malicious and accidental, has
decreased largely because of a pro-
gram instituted two years ago to
keep the amount of damage under
control. The program makes stu-
dents who are responsible for dam-

age pay for the restitution of the
damaged property.

James Beaver, business manager
for the Food Service Office said that
between S80-90,000 damage was
done last year in the nine residence
halls and in Forbes Quadrangle.

Thirty percent of all the damage
done on campus was paid for by
students last year, Beaver said.
When a person is identified and
linked to the damage, “any neces-
sary collection action is taken.”

James Watters, assistant director
for the campus police's deartment of
public safety, said that vandalism
throughout university facilities as a
whole is nota significant problem.

Watters said that people who
commit serious acts of vandalism
are “viewed under the charge of
criminal mischief." He also said that
some cases are referredvto the courts
for the restoration of property. He
added that “some cases are referred
to the judicial board for action."

Donovan Hughes, director of
Housing andiFood Service, said that
the programs instituted to fight van-
dalism have seen a great deal of
success.

“The unaccountable damage in .

the semi-public areas, such as hal-
lways, is where the university cannot
collect damages,” Hughes said.

He also commented, that “we con-

‘ Choice of any Corky’s   
5' Pan Pizza by the Slice   99¢  

done responsible behavior, and peo-
ple should be penalized for wrong
doing."

A problem with which everyone
can identify is the graffiti which
adorns the walls of almost every
building on campus. Hal Lavin,
superintendant of environmental
services, commented that the remo-
val of graffiti puts a heavy strain on
employee resources. He added that
two major efforts are conducted
each spring and Christmas, “but it’s
difficult to remove.” He explained
that as soon as a wall is cleaned, the
writing appears again.

‘ Al Sodomsky, an RA, com-
mented on the popular myth that

>.;~,-'- V - .1.

most vandalism occurs as a result of
alcohol. “People just get rowdy, and
you end up with broken glass.”

John Murray, a Tower B resident,
elaborated on the problems there by’
saying, “Every weekend, lights are
broken and beer bottles smashed.”
He also explained that people do get
caught, and action—such as going
before the Judicial Board—is taken
against them.

Some students suchas Carolyn
Shearer think that university rules
concerning damaged items are
unfair.“We paid, for a coat hook that
was broken when we moved in.”

As Watters commented, “We all
share-in this problem."

If you take the bus to campus
in the morning, you may be able
to sleep a bit longer.

Port Authority Transit’s new

East Busway has an Oakland .

stop in the planning. According
to Jason Fincke, assistant man-
ager of marketing and media
relations, the Busway was
“designed with the capacity for
Oakland service at Neville and
Center Avenues” and is expected
to be completed “sometime
around June or July.”

Fincke said there was no ques-
tion "that an Oakland station
would have an impact on Pitt
commuters. “Oakland is the
second largest area for ridership
in the city and the second largest
in the state,”.h_e said.

Lee Unites, who works at the
Pitt ticket office, said she sells

between 175 and 200 U-tickets a

day to Pitt commuters. This fig-
ure could very well increase with
the prospective Oakland stop.

“By removing buses from traf-

only at rush hours but also at

Internship Office Cut

continued from page one

dents_to lose two terms of class-
room study. This created a lack
of interest in the co-op program
and federal funding was lost.

Gallagher was able to get some
of the already-dwindling admi-
nistrative funds to begin the
Internship Office. He hired
Nancy Denhart two years ago,
only guaranteeing her position
for one year.

Denhart said she was able to
stay another year because funds
were found, but her secretary’s
position had to be dropped.

“We squeezed by on virtually
no funding,” said Denhart, “and
this year, my position has been
dropped.” 4

Garry Houston of the Student
Affairs Office agrees that the
office has been a good service.‘

“Hopefully,” he said, “it has
brought about a greater aware-
ness of internships not only to
students, but to the university.

“Decisions like this are hard to
make,” he said. “It’s a decision
that includes either diluting
other established programs until

there’s nothing but a shell left or
dropping a subprogram, such as
the Internship Office.”

The question of whether we ‘
can justify the 400 students
served by the office last term
compared to overall enrollment,
also is a major factor, he said.

According to Houston, a plan
to combine the services of the
office with the Job Placement
Service at the university and the
academic departments is being
looked into by Gallagher. This
would enable a computer match-
up between various internships
and interested students.

Employers would send posi-
tional needs to the computer at
the Job Placement Center, stu-
dents would submit their qualifi-
cations and the computer would
match them up.

“In a formal sense, internships
at Pitt have been dropped,” said
Houston, “since there will no
longer be any personal contact
between a liaison like Nancy
Denhart and the students—even

PRINCE, THE TIME, VANITY 6
February 28, 1983
Civic Arena

By JONATHAN WHALEY E

= Very few people are blessed with
instant recognition when they are
called by just one‘ name. Last Monday
evening, close to 10,000 concertgoers
meteperhaps "felt" would be more
accurate—the latest addition to this

and he put on a show that had the
audience completelyunder his spell.
However, before his performance,
there were two enjoyable acts—the
temperature-raising Vanity 6 and the
sophisticated and polished, The
Time.

The Minneapolis—based Vanity 6
‘put on a rather brief, quick-paced
show; it lasted no longer than 25 min-
utes, and if you were under the mis-
taken impression that the concert

them. These three young women
have given new life to the female
undergarment’ industry. Attired in
camisoles, Brenda, 21, the seductress,

hallowed list. His name is PRlNCE,_

started at 8 p.m., you probably missed '

Susann, 16, the teaser complete with
her teddy bear and Vanity, 19, the
vamp and the group's namesake,
managed to raise the temperature of
an already sweltering evening. They
opened with "Makeup" and closed the
five-song’ set with their most recent
hit, "Nasty Girls." During "Nasty
Girls,"-Vanity left little doubt as to
their definition of "nasty." '

The Time does not need any more
experience than what they have now.
Their lead singer is Morris Day, who,
it is safe to say, is the current "King of
Cool." From beginning to end, this
group had their finger on the pulse of
what the audience wanted to hear.
This seven—member group, ‘including
].B., the mirror man, performed with
a style and flair that could not help
but make you smile. Their 45 minutes
or so on stage went by all too quickly.

The opening number was "Get it

. Up,” which was, in a word, awesome.

In fact, Morris asked the people,
"Pittsburgh, are you ready to get it
up?” Believe me, they were.

During "Gigolos Get Lonely, Too,"
Morris invited one of Pittsburgh's
loveliest ladies to; come join him

Drinceand His Court Give Good funk

onstage for a glass of wine—a light
and crowd-pleasing touch. "Cool"
had the audience spelling out the
word with one hand while dancing
with the other. For the heartily-
deserved encore, it was none other
than "The Walk.” Every member of
the group participated and the cho-
reography (designed by Prince) was
flawless. ’The timing of the hair-
primping and watch-checking
sequences was excellent. There can't

{be too many more impressive ways to

end a performance.
Closing out the showwas the man

everyone had come to see: Prince. He
did not disappoint them. As a. fog

— enveloped the stage, you could just
make out the band. Where was_

Prince? He was elevated through the
smoke, on a platform, high above the
stage._An unpredictable but fitting
entrance for the fantastic light and
sound show ahead.

Attired in an 18th century purple
raincoat and matching pants with a
white ruffled shirt, he slid down a
pole and onto the stage. He kicked off
the show with "Controversy " and

 being the excellent showman that he

is, the audience was well on it's way
“ 1

‘ "Do Me Baby,” the women in the

toward a thrilling performance.
"Let's Work" had Prince doing lots of
gyrations, and the crowd responded
in kind. When he followed up with

crowd really got into the spirit of the

song; some _of_ them even seemed in .'

love with Prince.‘The tempo to
”Dance, Sex, Music and Romance”
kept things‘ moving right along.
Other songs performed before the
encore were ”You Don't Call Me
Anymore,” "Lady Cab Driver” and
one of his best songs, "Dirty Minds."

As the crowd pleaded for the
encore, Prince gave them one final

go-round. He twisted, shook and did ~

a variety of splits on the top of the
speakers to "Little Red Corvette” and
"International Lover." It seemed the‘
roof on the Civic Arena was almost
raised as the show ‘ended with his
chart-rising- hit "1999/’

For the people who were there and
those who wanted to be, it was no
dream at all. It was a memorable per-
formance by an individual who is at
the top of his class. Pittsburgh
crowned a Prince, and like fine wine,
‘he total show should be savored.

Theater Review:

R O U o R o
By CHRISTOPHER APPLEGATE ‘

Technology run amuck is a recur-
rent theme in 20th century art-, most
often expressed cinematically in films
ranging from Fritz Lang's Metropolis
(1925) to Stanley Kubrick's 2001
(1969). Theatrical exploration of the
same theme is less common, although
the stage version of Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein was done in the mid-19th
century. The classic play that deals
with these issues is universally recog-
nized to be Karel Capek’s R.l.I.R., first
produced "in Czechoslovakia in 1926.

R.U.R. stands for Rossum’s Uni-

guages of the world. The products of
the Rossum factory have almost
totally replaced human workers and
are produced in such vast quantities
that they outnumber the human
race. Inevitably, the robots revolt and
exterminate their former masters.
Deprived of the secret of their own
manufactue, the robots face extinc-

their hidden potential for human"

wonder, emotion and sexuality.
With robotscranking out cars in

‘Tokyo and Detroit and computers

becoming more common than electric
toasters, R.U.R. would seem to be an
ideal play for the '80s. Unfortunately,
despite the relevance of its themes,
R.U.R. is a difficult play to produce.
Although its central idea is modern,
the script is pure melodrama——ancl
not particularly good melodrama at
that. . ‘

It is to the enormous credit of
director Gregory Lehane and the
actors of the Carnegie~Mellon drama
department that their R.Ll.R., cur-
rently running at the Kresge Thea-
tre, is so overwhelmingly successful.

Lehane has come up with a produc-
tion concept that is part Marx Broth-
ers and part '50s sci-fi film (complete
with typical creepy music). While this
solves many of the awkward prob-
lems in the plot, in the wrong hands,
it could reduce the entire play to the
level of farce. Lehane never permits it
to topple over the edge, though, and

allows moments of real truth to play .

with crystal clarity.
Davidson Thomas and Maureen
Quigley display indefatigable energy

and deft timing as Domain, the fac-

‘Women in

tory director, and Helena, the presi-
dent's daughter who has come to
"liberate" the robots. Their abilities
get them through some clumsy
moments, such as when Helena

agrees to~marry Domain five minutes_

after they've met. Les—Paul Kniskern
is a standout as Dr. Call, the chief
engineer, playing him as a sort of
Vaudeville Einstein. Maxine Lapiduss
is delightful as Emma, Helena's semi-
hysterical human maid, and Wiley
Kidd is a very believable Radius, the

“leader of, the robot rev_o_lt;_Tennyson

Bardwiellv turns in a surprising “and
original characterization of Alquist,
the only human survivor of th revolt.

R.l.l.R. has a few places where it
stalls, becomes talky and borders on
dull. This is inherent in the writing,
however, and Lehane has minimized
it by judicious editing of Capek’s
script. The occasional lapses do not
really detract-jfrom the production's
overall excellence, however, and the
R.Ll.R. is well'- worth the trip to the

THIRTY DAYS TO HEALTHY

tops of their heads this stuff called
hair? It comes in colors, a lot different

ones. You must’ve seen it. Anyway,
like dogs and funeral arrangements,
hair is a thing that should be taken
care of. Now, Thirty Days To Healthy
Hair’ is available to instruct us all
about the phenomenon of hair. The
relief is indescribable. All the old
myths you once held in your heart as
truths are dashed to bits — did you
know, for example, that brushing 100
times a night can actually cause hair
to fall out?

Julie Davis (a well-known author
who has already brought us incredi-
ble 29 books, including how-to’s with

, such celebrities as Marie Osmond)

reveals the ultimate facts behind
”glossy, lush soft-to-the-touch hair...
one of the beautiful assets every
woman wants.” Don't youwant it?
It's -tricky business, though. Better
beware. Before‘ even "thinking or
shampoo, Davis advocates a well-
plotted ”healthy hair diet,” yoga_or
other exercises and a positive mental
outlook. (It's only Part 1 of her plan.)

”That might sound a bit mystical,”
she explains, ”but all it really means is
learning to control that bug felt by
every woman in the '80s: stress.”
Yup. It can really do nasty things to
your hair. I

OK -— are you physically and men-
tally relaxed? Let's do it. Part 2 starts
with a bang — the complete hair pro-
file! Got a pencil? The questions
aren't too hard, unless you can't tellif
your hair is straight or fine or wavy
or curly or dry or flaky. Next comes

the five-step plan for at-home care:

combing, _massage (of the head,
though), pre-shampoo treatment,
shampoo and conditioning.

Astonishingly helpful guidelines
for choosing a shampoo or condi-
tioner are listed — they ”must give
the hair body and shine” — as well as

.hints on how often to shampoo --

"certainly the book for women who

”when«dandruff flakes are prominent
in the strands,” for example. Good
thing she tells us; we might have
overlooked something like that. The
truth about hair dryers, hotcombs
and electric rollers is daringly
revealed — be careful!

The last part "of Davis’ plan
involves the proper hairstyle. Four
stunning models display some possi-
bilities that are dandy. The drawings
and photographs that appear in the
text make Thirty Days To Healthy Haira
definite illustrated guide—one of the
the brightest books of the season and

THE BELLE STARS
The Belle Stars
Stiff (U.K. import)

Pittsburgh, along with the
rest of America, is finally catch-
ing up with Europe's musical
diversity. Not only can you hear
Duran Duran, Depeche Mode,
Spandau Ballet and Ultravox on
the radio (even though Susie
Barber of 96KX mispronounced
"Duran Duran" up until a week
ago—a small price to pay,
though!) now, but also lesser-
known artists like...The Belle
Stars.

For the record, the Stars are
an all-female band, but similari-
ties between them and their
contemporaries like the Go-

'Go's or The Mo-dettes stop

there. These seven girls don't
restrict themselves to pop-
rock's limitations; instead,
they've taken elements of ever-
ything from ska (for a time, they
shared the same producer as
Madness) to salsa to jazz and
have developed their own style.

The result is a rejuvenating .

hybrid that, for all its originality

PORTRAIT
The Nolans
Epic

I'd like to blame this on the
emergence of groups like the
Go-Go's, but The Nolans are
-from across the sea and this
album is actually a compilation
of material that has been
since 1978, when
Belinda and friends were, like,

   

and fusion, contains rock and ‘ ‘

    
  

by a band as

roll’s best feature: it makes you
wanna dance.

Side 1 of this, their debut
album, kicks off with the band's
most recent British chart-
topper (Pittsburgh's most
innovative commercial station,
WYDD, has it on heavy rota-
tion, too), "Sign of the Times,”
which, in case you didn't read

-Showcase's review of the single

last week, is a fluid little piece of
dance-plop and highly-
recommended listening. "Ci Ya
Ya" brims with a funky skuffle
beat—typical Belle Stars style;
"The Clapping Song" (the Stars’
version has been out eons
longer than ole Pia ”My I-lus-
band’s Rich” Zadora’s mutila-
tion), "The Reason" and a\
remake of "Harlem _ Shuffle"
fare just as well on the choosiest
music connoisseur’s ears. .

The Dixie Cups’ old New
Orleans beat hit, "Iko Iko" never
had it so good, while yet another
"Mockingbird,” even ifit is done
good as The‘ Belle
fills u

grooving on surfers and stuff.
These girls, anyone of whom”
could be confused for the other,
obviously looked enough like
the gentler side of ABBA to land
themselves a recording
contract.

While it's obvious that flow or
theme goes out the window on a
compilation such as this, quality
should not. It does, however,

Side 2.. ”The Snake" is a slinky
story-song that uses the reptile
in an analogy to men. The LP’s
closer, "Needle In A Haystack,”
is a virtual dream of a ditty-
propulsive, rollicking and more
than mildly devastating, it
should have no problem reach-
ing the Top 10.

The Belle Stars have what it

‘ takes to-make it to the top of the

heap: ear-popping music, a

“stand-out singer (Jennie
.McKeown) with a voice that

both screams sensuality and
mocks it snobbishly and, to bor-

row a phrase from Adam Ant,

talent by ton. Record buyers,

Representative convention and
a TV album by the King Sisters.
Granted, some of the tunes are
catchy little re-workings of that
homogenized and shimmery
ABBA funk, but the vocals are
pale and the lyrics simply
insipid. '

Imagine Dolly Parton singing
through
McKuen getting shallow and
raunchy, and the elments might
take shape. There's a cover of
"Lead Me On," recently handled
by Maxine Nightingale, that
could give one nervous dis-
orders. There's even a version
of the nursery—rhyme line, "All
The King's Horses"???

England has a group called
Bucks Fizz which does things
along these lines with so much
more imagination and energy
that it boggles the mind‘ why
anyone would listen to The
Nolans.

Aurra's cord to its parent
group here is producer Stephen
C. Washington, who manages
to capture that same dance
excitement via Live and let I1've's
sizzling instrumentation, most
notable the mesmerizing bass
line that leaves you knee—deep
in funk. To dance, just listen to
the opening “hooks on the first
cut, "Such a Peeling," or any-
thing from the first side for that
matter. Lead vocalists Starleana
Young and Curt Jones (yeah,
ex-Slave members) share the
spotlight with confidence and
style with songs like "Coming to
Get You" and "Undercover
Lover."

The mid-tempo cuts, "Baby
Love" and "One More Time,"
work just as effectively thanks
to some arresting rhythm
arrangements. Live and Let  is
a capable follow-up to lastyear's
smash just A little Love, never
detouring from the formula
that brought that success.
What's needed though is some
definitive "breaks" in the up-
beat numbers. Their continu-
ous build in intensity promises

to overwhelm, but rather only

fades. ,

Maybe what's missing is the
soaring, intensity of Slave's lead
vocalist Steve Arrington. Oth-
erwise, a little reshaping for the
dance mixes, and the energy
might be recaptured.

-Rachel Sweet

CBS A

_ If rock—n—roll dealt in prosti-
tution, Rachel Sweet would
make a good whore. On this,

her fourth album, she makes it '
apparent that she would rather

sell herself to the likes of Pat
Benatar worshippers than rely
on the virtues of her own brand
of talent.

This may be a harsh stance,
but Rachel Sweet“ is wasting a
lot of real ability. Her first
album, Fool Around, showcased
this flair and raised the eye-
brows of many a listener—
especially since she was only 15
at "the time. ~ _.
However, though. Rachel
Sweet has grown up, her music
has remained in pre-ado-~
lescence. Her last two albums,
Protect The Innocent and And” Then
He Kissed Me, seemed to be des-
perate searches for a personal
style, when all she had to do was
listen to her debut work. She
eyen blundered _int‘o_a_du_et with

a girl who would like to see her-
self as the female counterpart to
Bruce Springsteen.

Blame It On Love, sadly, is no
different. While the album is a
lot gutsier than And Then He
Kissed Me, it-still flounders in its
establishment of Sweet's per-
sonal sound. She has scrapped
her ]APpish giggle-tone for a
much stronger soprano timbre,
however, by the third cut, it
becomes all too_obvious that she
has been studying Pat Benatar’s
chromosomal structure-
something she does not need to
do.

The first song on the album,
”-Voo Doo,” is the gem of the lot
and should soon find its way
onto the charts. Unfortunately,

  

Y I

  

Showca_s_e, Priday Math 4, 193

though the rest of the album is

not bad, it is overshadowed by "

Sweet's vocal cloning of Mrs.

woman her age, and the memo-

ries ‘of Pool Around indicate that”

she-also has the talent. It would
be so much better if she found

She's got a great voice for a

LETTER DEPARTMENT

Dear Editor:

I am a new student‘ here at the University of Pittsburgh and enjoy
reading The Pitt News with its broad variety. of news, sports and feature
articles. I am somewhat dismayed, however, with the lack of theater
coverage given to the local theater organizations and, especially, to Pitt's
own theater. I realize that space is often limited and that feature stories
must be selective, but it seems to meithat such an organization as the
theater deserves space for somethingother than reviews.

Many Pitt students, both theater and non-theater majors alike, partici-
pate in many of the productions—-not to mention the number of very _.
talented community people that appear on the university stage—and
deserve more recognition for their talent and the scores of hours they pour
into rehearsals than they havereceived thus far. ‘

I am a music fan-., I enjoy concerts immensely, but I also enjoy theater,
like many other students and faculty here at Pitt. I sense that concert and
music features far out-balance those directed toward the other arts, espe-
cially university theater productions. I would hope that provisions for
more theater coverage in The Pitt News could be made for an organization so
worthy of recognition. ' A ‘

Sincerely,
Bob‘ Steineck

Pilato, and Stephen Pellegrino.

By CHRISTOPHER APPLEGATE
Unless you are an art history

of Futurism. Founded by poet,
playwright and artist Filippo Tom
'maso Marinetti, the movement had
an enormous impact on dadaism and
surrealism and, through them, on
the art of our own time. Unlike dada-
ism and surrealism, though, Futu-
rism was grounded in theater. Like
the "Happenings” of the '60s, it was
theater produced by people who were
active in the fine arts. .

Although Futurist paintings and
sculptures are still appreciated
today, Futurist theater has been com-
pletely ignored. This is because mod-
ern audiences—and the original
audiences as well—found many Fut-

. urist themes offensive. In his origi-

nal Futurist Manifesto, published in
1909, Marinetti lists as his ninth
point, ”We will glorify war—the
world's onl h iene—militarism

Showcase, Friday March 4, 1983

tented last week at Carnegie-Mellon

University an evening of Futurism-
perhaps the first in 40 years.

With the help of five Italian-
American actors, Marinelli staged a
Futurist serata (evenings), in which
the audience was bombarded by
enormously energetic declamations
of Futurist essays and manifestos
and sintesi—-brief, condensed, and
wildly funny playlets that were the
chief theatrical works of the move-
ment. Marinetti’s original serate were

‘greeted by boos, catcalls, flying

vegetables and even fist fights. In
contrast, last week's audience simply
had one hell of a good time. Not even
a poem extolling the virtues of
Benito Mussolini, read by Ice Pilato
and accompanied by film clips of II
Duce at work and play, provoked the
audience into nothing more violent

' than applause.

Luce Marinetti, F.T. Marinetti’s
daughter, had flown in from Yale for
the performance. When I asked her

Over a month ago, the Panthers
were trying to establish respectabil-
ity; they found it in an upset victory
over St. John's. After the victory
over the Redmen, the Panthers went
on a roll, defeating both Syracuse
and Georgetown. It appeared that a
bid for the National Invitational
Tournament was within their grasp.

But with upsets by P_rovidence
and Seton Hill and a blow-out by
Boston College, Pitt is now looking
for the touch it had in February.
Unfortunately, the Panthers have to

Pitt, but it’s not likely. The Redmen
are fighting with Boston College for

nament. If St. John's loses and Bos-
ton College defeats Providence at

will get the rematch with the Panth-
ers Thursday at 3_p.m. at Madison
Square Garden.

There’s also the matter of pride.
With the upset by Pitt, the Redmen
were knocked out of first place in the

7 conference. They have yet to regain
that spot.

The difference in the first meeting

 s the performance of center
3‘ , dre Williams. The 6-8 sophomore

_ scored 24 points, shooting seven for
S 10 from the_ﬂoor. Since then, Willi-
"aids has’ faced ‘ problems, and his
, scoring average has dropped to nine
‘points per game. , J‘

In fact, Williams is doubtful for
tomorrow’s game due to a twisted
ankle suffered in the Providence
loss. If he doesn't start, 6-6 freshman
Matt Miklasevich will replace
Williams.

In the last game, Pitt, working
inside, shot 12 of l4from the ﬂoor in
the second half and held guard Chris
Mullin—the Redmen’s. leading
scorer——scoreless
minutes. .

During the first 30 minutes, Mul-
lin scored 20 points to give the lead
.to,St. John's. The sophomore, who
is second in the Big East in scoring, is
also first in free-throw percentage
and sixth in field goal percentage.

Forwrd David Russell should be
more of a force tomorrow than he

-was in the earlier meeting. "The 6-7

senior forward, playing his last game
at Alumni Hall, only had 11 points
at the Fitzgerald Field House on
Feb. 1. Russell, known for his out-
standing -leaping ability, is eighth in
the conference in rebounding, field
goals and free-throw percentage.

Billy Goodwin will probably" have
the responsibility of guarding Clyde
Vaughan, the league's leading
scorer. Goodwin, known for his def-
ensive play, also ‘contributed 13
points per contest.

Other starters for the Redmen are
6-2 guard Bob Kelly and 6-10 center
Jeff Allen. They will be subbed for
by 6-3 guard Kevin Williams and 7-0

There’s no doubt of the impor-
tance of the game for both teams.
Pitt would like to perform well to get
back on the right track for the tour-
nament. The Panthers would also
liketo prove that they can defeat a
good Big East teamon the road—
especially important if Pitt happens
to face the Redmen in the first
round.

St. John's would like this win to
avoid third place and a l p.m. meet-

the tournament. A meeting with sev-

more desirable, since’Pit't probably;

By LAURIE KUBLI

The stage is set for a rematch
between the Lady Panthers and the
Georgetown Hoyas at the Big East
tournament this weekend in Provi-
dence, R.I. Revenge must be on the
mind of Georgetown coach Mary
Briese, whose team got swept under
in the Lady Panthers six—game win-

ning surgetwo weeks ago, losing 75- »

59.. That was a regular season game;
this time, the teams are battling for a
spot in the conference tournament's

semi-finals and a possible bid for the ,

NCAA championships.

_ At their last meeting, the teams
were nearly even; the first half ended
with Pitt dominating by a slim mar-

gin, 27-23. The Panthers forged the .-

l6-point margin of victory with
improved field-goal shooting, going
from 32.4 percent to 62 percent, and
with control of the boards. This
time, Coach Judy Saurer said her
team will play a more conservative
game. ’
»‘‘We’re going to concentrate more
on defense, slow the gamedown a

Russell, ..

but I'll probably go with the same
people who've been playing."'

Among Pitt's starting‘ line up is
Big East leading scorer Jennifer
Bruce, a sophomore forward aver-
aging 21.] points and 9.5 rebounds
against conference opponents. The
Carrick High School graduate was
named Big East Player-of-the-Week
three times this season and collected
30 points and I1 boards against the
Hoyas two weeks ago.

Another Panther scoring threat is
senior tri-captain Pam Miklasevich,
who scored 18 points and was the
leading rebounder in the George-
town game with l2. She averages
17.9 points per game and 7.4
rebounds. Freshman Kim Tirik,
who ends the regular season tops in
the Pitt assist department with U3
and sophomore Becky Maziarz will
probably be the starting guards. The
Hoyas will also have to keep an eye
on Stephanie Collins, who has a hot
hand on the outside shot, where she
scores most of her points—including
eight against Georgetown. V

For the Hoyas, 5-9 junior Diane
Toliver was the leading scorer

sophomore, averages vI2.5 ppg and

Panthers. Georgetown has a pre-
season pick for the Big East Con-
verse All-Rookie squad in guard
Sarah Gause, who, along with
sophomore Maura Gill, each scored
8 points in the losing effort against
Pitt.

Saurer appreciates the fact that
her team is playing early today (1
p.m.).

“We’ll get it over with, one way or
another, and if we win, we'll have a
longer rest than, for example [confe-
rence champion] Providence who
doesn't play until 9 p.m.," she said.
“For now, thought, we'll just take
things one game at a time."

   IC4A’

By CHARLIE O'HARA

 
  

This weekend, the Panther track
team will compete in the IC4A
championships at Princeton, NJ.
Thirteen Panthers have qualified
individually while three relay teams
have also qualified.

But because of this weekend’s
scheduling, it is almost impossible to
run both relays and individual
events. As a result, only nine Panth-
ers will make the trip, and no relay
teams are entered.

“The schedule is too tight to run '
both, so we decided not to run the
relays," head coach John Vasvary
said. “It’s the last chance to qualify
for the Nationals, and this way, they
only have_to worry about their own
race.”

The scheduling of the track events
the way it has been in_the past has
allowed the meet often to be won by
strong field teams such as Maryland,
Princeton, Navy, Penn State and

a nigh jumper who has cleared seven

the-meet.

Evaluating the teams on the track,
Villanova, as it proved by its perfor-
mance two weeks ago at the Big East
meet, appears to be the team to heat.

It has possible National qualiﬁers in
almost every event. Farleigh Dick’,  .
son will also have a good chan1':*.§‘3.~'°'
with its balanced attack of strong
sprinters and hurdlers.

A prediction of the Panthers’
competition would be pointless; sev-
eral of the team’s mainstays will not
be competing. Junior Todd Colas,
ranked the No. 1 1,000-meter runner
in the country, is taking the week to
prepare for next week's NCAA
championships, for which he has
already qualiﬁed. Senior Darren
Geary will also be absent; he will be
taking a Secret Service entrance
exam.

The Panthers will also be without
their three relay teams, all of whictgp. >_
qualified for the meet this weekend. ’ 4
The 3,200-meter relay still has the
fastest time of any teamlin the coun-
try this year, and both the distance
medley and the 1,600-meter teams
finished third in the Big East
championships. ’

For the Panthers, this weekend
represents the final opportunity to
qualify for the NCAA meet. ‘ .

Rick Asberry, the Big East
runner-up and school record holder
in the 55-meter dash, will be the only
Panther entry in that event. Senior
Tim Lewis also qualified in the event
but will not make the trip.

In the 55-meter high hurdles,
sophomore Roger Kingdom, ranked
third nationally in the event, anéﬁliw
Darryl Shepherd will compete. M‘

Senior Mario Joyner, the ‘Big East
runner up, _will run the 400-meter
dash, and Big East 300-meter cham-
pion Brian Pollock will compete in
the 500-meter dash.

Terry Gallagher will run the 800-
meter event, and Bill Moorhead and
Garland Brown are entered in the
1,000-meter run.

In the field events, the Panthers
will enter two competitors. In the
high jump, Kingdom is scheduled tab-':~~_‘.‘\~,
compete. Big East champion fresh- “"'
man‘Bob Buczkowski, will compete
in the shot put.

It’s apparent that the Panthers are
entering the meet this weekend with

The college football season has
been over for about two months
now, and the Pitt Panthers are still
in the news. Unfortunately, and not
for the first time this season, the
news is nottoo rosy. Linebackers
Dave Puzzuoli and Dennis Atiyeh

' were arrested about two weeks ago

in the Oakland area and charged
with just about every offense that
city police categorize.

In light of the players’ brush with
the law, there is an interesting point
to be brought out. Should the play-
ers receive more public attention for

involved in similar skirmishes?
Should these players be chastised
more severely than the average stu-
dent because they are football
players?

The answer is yes. There is a cer-
tain type of responsibility with
which any collegiate player has to
burden himself. It is playing in the
limelight of collegiate athletics and
the consequences that come with it.

_ These include big-time TV coverage,

local and national media writeups
and falling into the adoration of
thousands of fans following any
team‘s progress.

However, that limelight will turn
sour occasionaly. A prime example
is the affair involving Puzzuoli and
Atiyeh. What they are accused of

sounds like a gladiatorial
encounters.

There are some people, including
athletic director Edward Bozik, who
will disagree. Bozik was recently
quoted as saying that both players
received undue recognition in the
press just because they are football
players. But Bozik is missing the
point.

Of course, it.is hard to fault Bozik
for any such statements. He is a per-
son in a position that demands the
precision of a businessman’s think-
ing. It would be hard to imagine him
saying anything to the point that
Puzzuoli and Atiyeh deserve all the
attention that is heaped upon them.

It would not be normal by any
standards. But it is arguments like

the ones Bozik pose that tend to dis- .

.Athletes That Live In Limelight Should Dieln It Too

hevel our thinking. Both players are
accused of taking their football tal-
ents to the streets and abusing them:
lt was an incident that deserved to be
placed in the limelight, despite what
Bozik had to say.

Players like Puzzuoli and Atiyeh
have to accept their decision to pla
for a nationally-respected football
team in a big city. By constantly
playing in the public’s eye, the play-

ers reap unlimited benefits. That‘s.

OK. The more the better. But when
those same players are involved in
the seedier sides of life, they must
come under the same public’s eye.

Why should they be shielded in
the instance of brushes with the law
and be publicized‘ while playing
football for a respectable squad?
Indeed, the distinction must not be

made. By deciding to ‘play in the
public’s view, the scrutiny or criti-
cism can’t be sacrificed when a
player is off the gridiron. _

Besides, football players physi-
cally aren’t like ordinary individu-
als. Constant bodybuilding for the
physical aspects of playing football
is obviously necessary. Those pow-
ers, however, can be easily used to
the player’s detriment.

By noting the interest Puzzuoli
and Atiyeh generated several days
ago, no one is getting any unduafﬁ...
publicity. The sad fact of it all is that “V
the poor publicity comes into play
when people attempt to rectify a
'player’s situation by saying that he
shouldn’t be scathed because he is an
athlete. Comments like that are
what really put a stake through the
heart of collegiate athletics and the
players who participate in it.

Who They Will Get....

The USFL commissioner, Chet
Simmons, met with representatives
of several college football conferen-
ces yesterday to discuss the league's
recruitment policies.

The league, in its inaugural sea-
