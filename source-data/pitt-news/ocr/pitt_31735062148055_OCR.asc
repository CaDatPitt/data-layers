Editor’s Note: Once upon a time
there was a freshman who went
out for The Owl and The News.
He was a pleosqnt,sort_gf.,_g21.g_,who I
took things sort of" easy and didn’t
want to do much work. So bingo,
the next thing you" know hewas
editor of The Owl.

Anyhow, below we print Dick’s
Weiss’ return engagement on The
News as he reveals the outlines of
his brainchild, the 1940 Owl.

By Dick Weiss, Ex-News Reporter
and Editor of The 1940 Owl

“Who is Polly Pitt?” “Who is Peter
Pitt?” Those are the queries we’ve
heard ﬂoating around the classrooms,
the Commons Room, and the “Dean of
Women’s ofﬁce, the Faculty Club, and »
even in the Know-It All News Office.

No, Polly and Peter Pitt are not
models for the coming styleshow;
nor are they ex-officio ‘members of
SFA Executive committee. Polly
and Peter are the stars of the 1940
production of The Owl, -Pitt’s top

European War Halts
Mailing of Publication

The Classical Weekly, publication
headed by a member of the Univer-
sity faculty, was asked last week to
stop sending publications to German
university libraries until further no-
tice.

Dr. James Stinchcomb, head of the
classics department and editor of the
Classical Weekly, believes that the
reason for the request is due tothe
insecurity and irregularity of mail
delivery caused by the recent events

 

in Europe.
However, this does not affect the
individual subscribers, of whom

there are about ﬁfty in Germany, and
the publications shall be mailed as
usual, Dr. Stinchcomb declares.

To mention some of the innovations l
-in the making for The 1940 Owl: alll
groups will be photographed out-
doors, providing the organizations
will cooperate by appearing promptly
at their scheduled times; the senior
section will be revolutionized by new
layouts featuring candid personality
shots in color scattered among senior
portraits, the latter being informal
this year; a Hall of Fame and Sen1’or
Queen section that promises to be a
honey; and a clutch burlesque map of
the University which will make Huh-

More attention will be paid to per-
sonalities and individuals in The 1940
Owl and a more complete coverage
of under-classes. . A

The writing staff is rigging up an
informal, sophisticated lingo of its
own which will be a combination of

Business Index
Continues Rise

Functioning as a barometer of
manufacturing in the heavy indus-
tries of the nation. the general level
of business in the Pittsburgh district
last week rose to a new high for the
recovery period, according to the
University Bureau of Business Re-
search.

The business index stood at 107.8
per cent of the 1923-25 level against
103.2 for last week, 73.2 in the corre-
sponding week last year, and 115.5 in
1937.

Iron and steel produciiora. steel
ingot production, and blast furnace
operations were, as expected, respon-
sible for the rise in general indexed
activity. Electric power output pro-
duction established a new high rec-
ord.

“In the current business recovery,”
the Bureau states, “it is clear that
production has been taking the lead
and trade has been following with a
mu of at least two weeks.”

The Alumni Conduct
A Membership Drive

The [.'niver.-.ity's General Alumni Association is
now atltenipting to secure a la—rge_i11cI'easc in mem-
bership.» This year’s Alumni Inembership drive is
extrcinely important to the Association, for it is
‘l1(.)\‘.'\l’,l'itl(3lll}," ti sharp curtailment of its activities.
This is liecaiise the l]:'niversi1;_v has not yet indicated

wlietlier it will continue its usual-subsidy to the
Alumni Association for the current year.

Since 1933, when-the General Alumni Association
1'cceive(l :1 <,»,'r-ant of $21,000, the University has been
liclpin;.»; to support the gI'o1ip, decreasing its allot-
niemts-eacli year as the income from alumni dues
ir1'c1'e_ascd. The 'l7niversity[subsidy for 1938-39 was
:ﬁ,ll.l.,i(l(l(V), which amounted to about half of the Gen-
~cra| Alumni Association ’s budget. .

This year, the U_niversity’s subsidy to the
:Ailu«mni has been delayed. As a. result, the Asso-
cintiiiii has been unable to conduct its operations
nor1na.ll_v. No replacement has been secured for
Don Saunders, who resigned as Alumni secretary
last April. No replacementhas l)e8I1‘S€C11-I‘€d for
William Allison, who-resigned as Alumni editor and
acti--iig lsecretary last May. Publication’ of The’
Alumni ‘Review, one of the ‘nation's, three best

alumni ma,<.razines, has not been resumed.

, A If the ‘University wants tl1ciGeneral Alumni As-i

sociation to continue its activities on the st.-lndard .

0‘)

which it establislied in 190;», it must continue its
polic__v of 21 subsidy, making allowance for the in-
creasiorl strcngtli of the group eac.l1.ycar._ ‘

’l‘hc1'e is one factor’ which coniplicates the pres-
ent situation for the Alumni Association. Next
spring‘, the nt«embers of the General. Alumni Asso-
cation will nominate thirteen alumni to the Board
«:).f"l‘r11stees. it would seem rather queer for the
University to discontinue its support of the Asso-
ciation only 2. few months before preparations for
this election V‘\‘tf‘l‘€ to begin.

()n the attitude of the Alumni Associziton, Earl
_(_?ruwl.'or(l, president of the group for 1938-39, in his
Tdlllllltll report, wrote: “From my conversations
with (Jham-ellor Bowman and with members of the

))()?ll'(l of Trustees, I have concluded that they are
not so nnu:h concerned about the financial record
of the Associzition as they are desirous of :1. strong,
loyal alumni body. It seems to me that in the re-
cent period of turbulence and stress, the great body
of’ alumni was loyal to the lTniversit_v and that the
.Association was useful to the l»'niversit_v adminis-
tration."

We agfrec with John B. Nickles, Jr., president of
the Association, that the al11I1111i-giviiig plan should
be rc—(‘stabli>:lie<l. \-Ve believe that the Alumni As-
socintion should exist without iUniversit_\,' siipportr

But we lwli:-\'e tliat this is a bad time for the
University to discontinue its support of the Alumni
Association. By its action in. this situation, the
zldministrution inns an opportunity to cause another
of the of
pla}_»,'1ie(l the l';nive1'-sity.

~-activity with Europe.

Common Sense
' Byx.‘Senator’ Ziskind

There’s- a cloudy haze that hovers over our city, and
at night it shoots across the sky in blazing ﬂame. ' It’s .
the new “prosperity”that has -cometotown. Men have
picked up their shovels and picks. And they’ve- gone
off to work--to smelt Europe's I guns and =tan'ks'into=='
shape. ‘ " ‘ ‘ 

-m._.._.___———

Now I don’t want to criticize the steel men, the wdrk-
ers, or anybody else who is out managing or sweating to
take aidvantagelof this “prosperity.” M
they are entitled to it. With but one short interruption
in 1937 they have been the victims, for a period of ten
years, of depression: no orders, 30 per cent capacity, in-
solvency, and all the rest.

Goodness lknows,

For ten years they have
barely kept aﬂoat, and surely would have gone under if
it were not for the helping hand of the federal govern-
ment.

My point is this: Have we reacheda condition of‘
economic stagnation? Must we as a nation be revived
by either a war or artiﬁcial government ‘stimulation,
and then immediately afterwards, groggily drop over
in complete prostration? Certainly we are entering
into another period where “fool’s gold” is the order

of the day. We are buildingourselves up for" the most
catastrophic depression ofall time. b I V, i .

It is encouraging indeed when one is broadminded
enough to recognize thevgominous forebodings of the
prospective business upswing, especially when he is the
most prone to proﬁt from it. I refer to the statement
of E. T. Weir opposing. repeal of the arms embargo. I.
steadfastly disagree with his stand on this issue, but I
must express admiration for his willingness to disre-
gard immediate personal interest for’ the long time
economic interest of the United States.

If we are to save ourselves from impending disaster,
we must regulate, and regulate with a vengeance. Gov-
ernment must step in. It must restrict proﬁts. ; It must
clamp down on overcapitalization. Itmust hold the
stock market in a ﬁrm-grip, puttingan end to its sky-
rocketing, its pathetic pulsations dependent on rumor
and doubts. It must "keep its program of social reform
on the go, reinforcing bigger proﬁts with acorrespo,nd-
ing rise in wages. ;

Unrestricted business anarchy would be the folly of
America." ’ v - - ,_ V ~
I, for one, am not thrilled at the vertically point-
ying business barometer here and in other parts of the
country.‘ Rather I consider it tragic indeed that what
spasmodic outbursts of prosperity we might have must
be based upon the horrendous bestiality of man’s re-
lationship to man. ' n

Editor, The Pitt News:

We, the founders of the Suds Club, challenge the
Society for the Prevention of Dreary Noon Hours to

produce evidence that its organization was on campus
before the Suds Club.

The Suds Club was established in 1937—savings. ac-
count and all.‘ "We have ﬁfteen charter members, and
an auxiliary of ten women. Further, we have spon-
sored a charity dance, contributed to the school’s
Christmas fund, held a special seat section at all foot-
ball games and participated as a recognized body at the
rally for Jock Sutherland.

At the close of the last school year the Suds Club
had a two point average and was as strong as any fra-
ternity here in activities. To date, we have over thirty
members.

If W.W.,  M.M., and W.J., are interested in
becoming aﬁiliated they must disclose t‘neir‘true iden-
tity and accept the usual procedure of nomination,
tapping and initiation.

We are ﬁrm believers in the Sherman Anti-Trust
Act———we will merge with no group, club, fraternity,‘
utility or administration.

these countries along with Greece“
and Turkey into an alliance against
German drives to the southeast.

Thisais the opinion of Dr. Carl L.
Stotz, recently appointed ‘assistant
professor in geography.

From 1930,to 1935, Dr. Stotz was
geographer at Robert college in Is-
tanbul, Turkey. He is recognized ‘as
an authority on political geography.

Dr. Stotz believes: that. the new ﬁve

conﬁdent that their real’ objective
will be the eventu:3;.1 dismembermeiit

This is what Dr. Stotz says about
Europe; “Russia haslong been wait-
ing for-an excuse to reoccupy Besse-
rabia. : The return "of Bukovina and
Banal; is sought by Hungary. Bul-
garia expects Dobarudja back.

“Turkey and Greece would be re-
waraded with economic favors by
Russia. _ I 1;

“But that would not be the end of
territorial readjustments in Central
‘Europe. The absorbing of Western
Thrace into Bulgaria wiill give .that
country a passageway into the Aege-

bly be peacefully granted to Bulgaria
if the Ital’ia‘nDo‘decanese Islands are
seized by this ﬁve power group and
presented to Greece. Italy itself
might be a target of this new bloc.

“Russia also looks toward the small
states in the Northelznipart of Central
Europe. Russia wants more seacoast.
Esthonia and Latvia have enough
coast on the Baltic to tempt -Russia.
Lithuania, however, has had little to
worry about since Memel‘ became
German.” .

The neutral bloc —- Finland, Nor- '
way, Sweden, Denmark, Holland-,
Belgium—-can feel safe for a time
from both Germany and Russia. — Dr.
Stotz doubts that anything will hap-
pen to these countries.

I _ By John Burnham 

“Arms embargo” sounds like an excellent way to
keep out of the European war. Thomas Jefferson’
thought so and tried it back in 1807. But it didn’t work.

Jefferson wanted to keep us out of the war between
imperialistic England and Napoleonic France. The
surest and most logical method was to cease all economic
The Embargo Act accomplished
this; it preserved peace at the expense of valuable Euro-
pean trade. It didn’t take the nation long to decide be-
tween peace and trade. The Embargo Act was quickly
repealed in favor of trade-——and the War of 1812. I

Nobody was so foolish as to seriously consider an
embargo in -1914. Trade went right on, as American
commercial interests revealed in war proﬁts. But when
it began to appear that the wrong side might win, the
entire resources of the nation were used to save these
war investments. The tremendous loss in commodities,
money, and menno‘a.n’ by no stretch of the imagination
be conceived to liavgmade the war trade proﬁt-able.

Today. the arms embargo seems destined to give way
to the greed for war proﬁts. “Cash and carry" sounds
like a safer form oil‘. investment, -but-; it is still essen-

tially a gamble on the chat'1ce‘s'? of war.’

FnoM THE

SIIIELINES 0

By BILL McELWAIN.
. Sports Editor

THIS ISANOTHER YEAR at Pitt, but nobody seems to have
noticed it. The journalistic horde is:sti1l making Pitt the center of
athletic furor despite the fact that Dr. John Bain Sutherland, the
hero of last year’s wars, has departed for the peace and quiet of tem-
porary retirement. _ A

Mr. Joe Williams, sports editor of the New York VV’orld-Tele-
gram an(l the Scripps-Howard chain, came to Pittsburgh to take in
the Billy Conn-Melio Bettina light heavyweight ﬁght last Monday eve-
ning and stayed on to write two columns of condemnation of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

Williams’ Information One-Sided

Now, in a general way, we like Mr. VVilliams. We have never
met. him, but we read his daily observations with considerable in-
terest. Consequentl_v, we were more than a little disturbed to see

him continuing the tirade which he began some months ago and .

which, we thought, he had let dribble to a close within a few weeks
after the original moment of his irritation.

It is not our intention to deny’ anything Mr. VVilliams said in his
pair of columns. Rather we would like to suggest that his infor1na-
tion was one-sided. He claims that he talked to “alumni leaders, mem-
bers of the influential letter club, student editors, and others who pro-
fess to be familiar with the situation.” *

ln analyzing that list‘ of information-givers, we’ve decided that
not only was Mr. \Villiams one-sided in his approach, but that he
had his mind made up peforehand as to the outcome of his inquiries.
In so doing, he probably fell a Victim to the very natural error of
talking only to the people who could tell him what he wanted to be
told.

Editors Not Approached ._

We do not doubt thathe was told what he professes tohave been"
told. There are a great many alumni who concur with his conclu-
sions. The Varsity Lettermen’s Club showed long ago, at the very
outbreak of the dispute, that their stand was with Sutherland. As
for the student editors, we know that the past year’s editors were
ardently pro-Sutherland. For the sake of the record, let it be known
that none of the present editors of any campus publications were
quest'ione'd.-‘jzln that respect, _Mr. Williams’,1-eferenceto ‘_‘stfudent edi-
tors” is aljttle znnbiguous. . .

"l‘l1e1,1.'_.ive come to“th‘c “others who .p_ro-fesssftogbeafamiliar -with
the situation.” We sincerely .-believe Mr._Will,iam,s.:slipped up_there.
Every other Juan. -woman, or child in Pittsburgh professes to be fa-
miliar with the situation. ltfis our contention that, except for a-limit-,
ed number of tlioseintimately involved, no onecan hope to! know
what went on. Practically..all of Mr. Williams disclosures ,we have
heard in the past year, and We still question the complete reliability
of many of t.l1em.. . ..
University Guilty of Errors ~

If he had gone still further" in his searc.l1_.\for truth, he would
have found a large volume of material, mostly verbal, which directly
refutes his present ﬁndings. Host of that material..-is as well founded
as an equal proportion of Mr. VVilliams’ infor,n'1ation. W'hy should
the examples of University bungling, cited })y_M-r..\Vi'lliams, be re-
garded as p1'e.cl1uli11g any possible mistakes 'l)y'_ Dr._ Sutherland and
his followers‘?  , '  -

The l7niversit’y of Pittsburgh has been: guilty of some gross
slip-ups, Wl'll¢"ll we thoroughly condeifnn. Butthat the University
administration is making all the er1'ons is just too much for us to
stomach.  . I
And so we say, come again, Mr. W.’illiams. Stay longer—and look
farther.  '

day, Charley Bowser’s ﬁrst big-time grid creation passed the'Huskies

Only once, in the third period, did Washington hav-e the Pan-

The rest of the game was strictly Pitt, as the

of 18 passes, 12 of which hit their ob-
jectives.

the ﬁnal period and place kicking an

was Dick Cassiano
and __E,m_il Narick
who stole the show
with their accurate
aerials. Ernie Bo-
nelli, on_ the . spot
as Goldberg’s suc-
cessor, teamed "with
Cassiano to pick up
most of the yard-'
age gained by the
 Panthers along the
ground. -— * -

‘Despite the con-
vincing win, Pitt
showed weaknesses.
The running attack
stalled frequently, Narick was sel-
dom a serious ball-carrying threat,
and the defensive play of the ends
was often ragged- P

But it was a generally satisfactory
afternoon. for Pitt followers. The
second team line got some «valuable
experience under tire, and the en-
tire squad acquired much-needed
conﬁdence. -Particularly pleasing to
Bowser was the work of Ralph Fife
and Steve Sinco, sophomore guard
and center, who should bolster the
reserve strength of the Pitt line. i

The Panthers wasted no time get-

ed off and a quick kick hadreturned

yard line, dodged a couple of Huskies
and scored. With Cassiano holding,
Rettinger kicked the extra point
and Pitt had a 7-0 lead.

Half way through
quarter, Pitt struck again. Mc-
Adam’s kick was partially block-
ed and Mike Sekela, in for Kish,
fell on it on the Washington 44..

was a simple mat-

down. Rettinger’s
pass for the extra
point was . incom-
plete, and Pitt was ahead, 13-0.

‘In the third period, with a ﬁrst
down on the Pitt 46 after Kish’s poor
punt, Jones, McAdams and Steele
moved the ball to the Pitt one in 10
plays before Jones went over. His

Reveals Reds Will Win Series

\’V'l1o’s going to win the World Series? The Yanks or the Reds?

W~hat does the average co-ed

English professors hold an opinion? I

think about it? What does the
does the freshman think? _Do the

Sources close to the English professorsintimate that there’s a
radical.spl.it in the viewpoints about “who ’s gonna win.” Some of

them d‘on’t.- give what is esthetically¢
called a darn and-some of them ain’t
esthetic about it.

The average male student is pretty
well worked up about it and the con-
sensus favors the Cincinnati Reds be-
cause of Derringer and Walters. If
the stearning bats of the Yanks are
to cooled, these are theboys that will
do it, claims the consensus. The con-
sensus, a group of three engineering
students, was holding up a wall in
the Commons Room. ‘They gave their
viewpoints but asked that their names
be omitted. They wished to be re-
ferred to as a “reliable source.”

,We always have trouble when we
approach the fairer sex on these in-
formal sport quizzes. This time We
chose two sprightly looking girls who
looked athletic. “Who‘s going to win
the World‘, Series?” we said.

Then for the next ﬁfteen minutes
they put us through the wringer.
When we ﬁnished we wound up with
a raffle ticket, :1 ticket to some kind of
dance and a dopey opinion. They
didn’t have anytime to read about
sports or the silly war. However,
they both chose the Yanks because it
was the patriotic thing to do. Which
ought to be a relief to Manager Mc-
Carthy.

After that we approached about six
freshman who looked docile. When

they didn’t read the sport page any
more. “There’s too much going on
in the outside world,” they _chanted.
