Police testimony conflicts

Monday, January 23,lQ84_

in football players’ trial

By John Gambescia
The Pitt News

The trial of current Pitt football player Dennis
Atiyeh and former’ Pitt star Dave Puzzuoli, both of
whom are facing charges of aggravated assault and a
series of lesser charges stemming from an altercation
with Pittsburgh police last February, will continue
today with the defense presenting its case before the
12-memberjury.

The prosecution called its final two witnesses in the
case last Fridayifollowing which, motions were submit-
ted by the defense to have certain charges thrown out
before the start of its case. The motions were presented
before Judge Loran Lewis in his chambers, and he will
rule on them before the start of today’s proceedings

Officer Carl Metz, one of the original arresting
officers, testified Friday that upon leaving his patrol
car to apprehend Puzzuoli, he forgot to bring his
nightstick. Metz said that as the altercation began and
he was allegedly thrown onto the hood ofthe patrol car
by Puzzuoli, he grabbed a nearby officer’s nightstick to
defend himself.

However, at a preliminary hearing held last March,
Metz testified that he did in fact leave his patrolcar with
his night stick.

The prosecution’s ﬁnal witness,
Lt. Joseph Wind, testified that
during the altercation, he heard a
nightstick crack over someone’s
head.

At the same preliminary hearing, Metz further testi-
fied that Atiyeh had struck him several times and
caused a severe left shoulder injury. During Friday's
proceedings, however, Metz said that Puzzuoli had
struck him, causing the shoulder injury. It was also
revealed that Metz failed to submit any written report
of the injury until April 6, a month and a half after the
incident. -

The prosecution’s final witness /was Lt. Josep
Wind, the ranking officer the night of the incident.
Wind testified that during the altercation, he heard a
nightstick crack against Puzzuoli‘s head several times.
Wind also said that officers are trained not to strike a
suspect on the head but to aimforthe legand kneearea.

Testimony for the defense will include many bys-
tanders and eyewitnesses. Atiyeh and Puzzuoli are also
expected to testify on their own behalf.

Faculty union to petition

for   collective bargaining

By Marty Willis
The Pitt News

Despite a recent decision by the
United Faculty union to petition for
collective bargaining recognition,
the university administation remains

‘The university has taken the position that
collective bargaining for faculty at Pitt is not
in the best interest of the university or the
faculty. ’,

according to university counsel
David Sullivan.

“The university has taken the posi-
tion that collective bargaining for
faculty at Pitt is not in the best inter-
ests of the university or the faculty,"
Sullivan said. This position is con-
sistent with earlier statements by Sul-
livan, the university’s attorney for
this issue, and by Chancellor Wesley
Posvar in letters to the group’s presi-
dent, Philip Wion.

United Faculty’s Jan. 12 member-
ship meeting resulted ina unanimous
decision to file a petition with the

_Pennsylvania Labor Relations

Board calling fora faculty election on
the issue of collective bargaining in
the Provost’s area, Wion said. “l’m
certainly pleased at the unanimity,

‘and we will be going forward to

initiate the process that will bring
about an election,” he said.

The decision to petition represents
a change of strategy for United
Faculty, which has sought since its
formation in 198] to become the

legally recognized bargaining agent
for the approximately l,250 faculty
members in the Provost’s area.
Instead of continuing actively to seek
the agreement of the administration
in a request for an election, the pro-
fessors decided to file a unilateral
request with the board, Wion said.

‘I was not aware of [the decision],
and to my knowledge, nobody in the
administration has been informed
yet,” Sullivan said last week. He said
the administration anticipated that
the union would file because the two
sides have failed to reach an agree-
ment on the issue and because the
professors did not contact him.

Sullivan’s Jan. 6 letter to Wion left
open the possibility ofa meeting with
the professors.

Wion and United Faculty vice-
president James Cunninghan, how-
ever, said they want to meet
personally with Posvar, not Sullivan.

“Right now, the chancellor will not
even write us a letter using the words
‘United Faculty,‘ ” Cunningham

said. Letters from Posvar on Nov. 29
and Sullivan on Jan. 6 began with the
words “Dear Phil" Wion said. i
This reflects an unwillingness by
Posvar to talk with the professors asa

unified group, Cunningham said-

“We’ve leaned over backwards trying
to get the administration to consent
to this election.” Even so, he added,
“We‘re still hopeful that the univer-
sity might agree to an election."

Sullivan said he has not ruled out
that talks with the group might lead
to a better mutual understanding
between U nited Faculty and the uni-
versity. “I don’t believe that such a
conversation would be a total waste
of time," he said. i

United Faculty has scheduled a
press conference for tomorrow at
10:30 a.m. at the Faculty Club.
“We‘re going to give a background
on the events leading up to this deci-
sion," Cunningham said. “We’re
going to explain why we’re doing it
and announce the definite details on
the filing.”

New diagnosis  
center set to open

By Tim Hunter
The Pitt News

The state has approved the new
Magnetic Resonance Institute,
which will make this area a leader in
research.

The institute is’ a cooperative
effort by Pitt, the University Health
Center and Carnegie-Mellon
University.

“Our goal is a new, independent,
nonprofit organization. We plan to
make this institute the premier
research center of the nation," said
Charles Holbert, associate planning
director of the university health
center.

Unlike X—rays and CT Scanners,
magnetic resonance machines can
produce images without the use of
potentially harmful radiation. It
also does not use painful injections
or bulky electrodes. The machine
exposes the body to magneticand.
radio-frequency fields and extracts

the necessary biochemical-
information. This information is
then sent to a computer, which dis-
plays it as a highly-detailed image
for diagnoses.

Part of the institute will be located
in a new facility at the corner of Fifth

and Craft avenues. There is pres-
ently a parking lot, owned by
McGee Women's Hospital on this
corner. Holbert said the 1300-car
parking garage located across from
the dental building can handle the
extra cars now parked at the Fifth
and Craft lot.

The new facility will house two of

the largest magnetic resonance 5
I machines most suited for use with

people. “We are designing this facil-
ity with the most advanced and
sophisticated equipment,” Holbert
said. Themachines are manufac-
tured by General Electric.

Another part of the‘ Magnetic
Resonance Institute will be located
in the basement of the Mellon Insti-
tute. The basement presently has a
facilityiwith a magnetic resonance
machine used for research on
animals. '

Magnetic resonance is awaiting
approval by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for use in
non-research clinical areas. The

FDA is working to find the best
technique for producing the images.

The ‘Magnetic Resonance Insti-
tute was supposed to be named
“Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Research and Development Insti-
tute of Pittsburgh." .

“The name was changed because
people get too excited about the
word nuclear,” Holbert said.

machines and nuclear reactors work

Almost all of the local medical
facilities are helping with the finan-
cial costs except Allegheny General
Hospital, which is building its own
smaller facility, Holbert said.

The estimated cost for the new

These costs include facility construc-

The expenses are low because the

companies that produce the equip-

  Graduate enrollment rises

By Megan Mcﬁough
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s increased graduate school
enrollment in the last year is follow-
ing the national trend, according to
Nancy Anderson, assistant to the
dean of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences.

There are 1,637 graduate students
currently registered through the
Faculty of Arts and Sc'iences(FAS),
as compared to l,565 a year ago,
Anderson said. This 4.6 percent
increase coincides with the national
statistics compiled by Bernard V.
Khoury of the Graduate Record
Examinations Board.

Results from 243 schools
responding to the annual survey
conducted by the Educational Test-
ing Service show av l.4 percent
increase in graduate enrollment this
year over last year. Khoury said the

1983-1984 figures represent the first
increase in three years, according to
a recent article in The Chronicle of
Higher Education.

Pitt enrollment in the social
science departments has remained

constant over the last year, but a,

marked increase has taken place in
the humanities and natural sciences,
Anderson said.

“In the English department, the
number of graduate students is up
significantly over last year,” said
Robert Hinman, director of gradu-
ate studies in Pitt’s English depart-
ment.‘ There were 115 students in
English last year and 140 this year,
Hinman added. He attributed this

Production Manager

rise to an increase in the depart-
ment’s budget.

New composition requirements
for undergraduates have created a
need for more teaching assistants,
Hinman said. As a result, additional
funds became available for graduate
stipends. _

Contrary to Khoury’s findings,
enrollment in the Graduate School
of Public and International Affairs
is slightly below last year’s ﬁgures
according to Jane Lohman, director
of admissions. Lohman said the
1982-1983 school year was the
record peak for enrollment in the
school.

The economy “definitely has some
bearing" on the overall increase in
graduate enrollment, Lohman said.
“Two of our students are receiving

laid-off steelworkers’ benefits." One
third of the students currently regis-
tered in GSPIA are returning to
school after three or more years in
the work force.

Director of admissions in the
Graduate School of Business, Wal-
ter McGee, said people are returning
to graduate school because “they are
looking for a,betterjob orjust trying
to protect their current jobs.”

Enrollment in the Graduate
School of Business is holding steady
at 225. More students are applying
and being admitted to the business
schools night school, which also
offers a graduate degree.

There are 625 students in this pro-
gram, McGee said. “Their motiva-

0'

tion‘ is simply a hope for a decent.

job."

A chemistry professor was to
have had surgery over the week-
end to correct damage to his eye
socket, the result of a student’s
response to a failing grade,
according to William Howell of
the chemistry department.

Darel Straub, who has been
affiliated with the university
since I961, was confronted in his
office in the chemistry building
last Wednesday by a student
appealing to have his grade

Prof assaulted over grade

changed, Howell said. Straub
reviewed the student's records
from the freshman-level course
and decided not to change the
grade.

The student then attacked
him, causing facial lacerations
and eye socket damage. The stu-
dent, Paul Mattarock, 26, was
arrested by campus police,
according to Lt. James Watters,
assistant director of the campus
police.

By Jill Devine
For The Pitt News

Last March, John Funari, dean of
Pitt‘s Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs, testified
before the U.S. Senate Subcommit-
tee on Education, Arts and Humani-
ties on legislation to implement a
national peace academy in Washing-
ton, D.C.

The bill was rejected by the sub-
committee, but staff member
Rudolph Vallee said that the sub-
committee. “wasn’t swayed” by the
opponent’s arguments and the sub-
committee recently passed a revised
version of the bill which now’ pro-

V poses to aim funding toward more

relevant programs and to obtain

~ “more expertise” from people in the

Defense Department and the Central
Intelligence Agency.

The subcommitte also reduced its
funding authorization from $3 I mil-
lion to $23.5 million.

Funari expressed opposition to
the bill as it was originally written
and said that there already exist nine

Housing Director Donovan
Hughes rejected the suggestion that
a new elevator system be installed in

Pamela Hart.

Hughes had said that although the

have 10 years of servicibilitv, Hart
told members at last Thursday's
‘board meeting. _

He also explained that the addi-
tional $30,000 to $40,000 it would
take to purchase new elevators
would be passed on to the student
body in the form of higher tuition,
she said. ‘

Funari told the subcommittee that
he opposed the bill “with the greatest
reluctance” but added that any
attempt to establish Q a degree-

‘granting institution would be a
“duplicative and wasteful use of
resources."_

Funari said that a new, separate
peace‘ academy would only compete
with other peace institutions, thereby
thwarting progress. He suggested
that the Senate subcommittee pro-
pose a center that would simply pro-

vide funds for already-existing‘

institutions.
The bill was originally introduced
to establish an independent, non-

profit corporation to be called the
United States Academy of Peace.
The academy would be similar in
organization to existing military
academies which teach defense
strategies. The academy would con-
duct research on peacemaking and
fund other institutions to do the
same. It would provide peace semi-
nars and workshops as well as gradu-
ate and post-graduate degree
programs for students. It would also
create an information service to
gather data on peacemaking and to
report its findings to the public.

The Reagan Administration has
opposed the idea because of “severe
budgetary restraints," according to
congressional reports. The report
maintains that there are already

 Bill calls for peace academy

ducted at universities and other
institutions.

State Department officials have
responded to the peace academy
proposal saying that peace is their
business and that they are doing a
pretty good-job, according to Vallee.

In a letter to Sen. Spark M. Mat-
sunaga of Hawaii, a member of the
subcommittee, Reagan wrote: “In a
time of severe budget stringencies, I
find it difficult tojustify the expendi-
ture...of federal funds over the next
several years for research, educa-
tional and informational activities in
an area where much work is already
being done by private universities,
institutes and foundations."

Most of the funds forthe academy
would come from the federalgovern-
ment, but it would also accept gifts
and donations from private
institutions.

“The U.S. Peace Academy," Val-
lee said, “would enhance other insti-
tutions and be a source offunding to
strengthen existing programs."

The bill must now go before the full
Senate.

The Nationality Rooms and Inter-
cultural Exchange Programs is now
accepting applications for scholar-
ships that will give students the

opportunity to spend the‘ summer ’

studying abroad.

‘The scholarships, which are
funded by members of the national-
ity rooms committee, memorial
awards and personal endowments,
enable students to attend an educa-
tional institution of their choice in
one of the countries that represent
the university’s historical nationality
rooms.

“Thisis quitea unique opportunity
for Pitt students, in that the nat'nal-
ity rooms are one of a kind, so is the
scholarship program one ofa kind,”
said Maxine Bruhns, the program’s

‘ director.

Fifteen scholarships are available
this year, and since the nationality
rooms were completed in 1948, more
than 300 scholarships have been
awarded.

“After completion of the rooms,
the various ethnic groups that took
part in their construction wanted to
do something special in honor ofthe
rooms but did not know in what
capacity,” Bruhns said. “They
decided that sending students to the
various countries that make up the
rooms would be an excellent way to
promote intercultural education.”

“This is a tremendous opportunity
for students because it makes study-
ing abroad affordable,” said Angie
Yucas, director of Pitt’s study abroad
program. “Although there is state
and federal aid available for regular

terms, there is a widegap of funds
available ‘For the student wishing to
spend a surgmer studying abroad.”

Yucas said that students consist-
ently return having had beneficial
experiences. “Not only does studying
abroad provide academic expe-
rience, it facilitates travel and cultu-
ral experience that can remain with a
student for the rest of his life,” Yucas
said. I

Collective Guilt

Who is responsible for the damage caused by a drunken

driver?

If last week’s $690,000 out-of-court settlement between the
downtown disco Heaven and a victim crippled by a drunken
Heaven patron is any indication, bar owners and bartenders
have begun to share this responsibility. While this is a step in
the right direction, a great deal remains to be done to deal with
the problem ofdrinking and driving.

A Pennsylvania law prohibiting bars from serving liquor to
“visibly intoxicated" persons will no doubt be taken more
seriously in the wake of recent lawsuits. The so-called “dram
shop law" is to be commended as a well-intentioned first step;
however, its enforceability is extremely problematic. ,

Many local bartenders have complained that they are being
forced to play a babysitter’s role. A patron who hops from bar
to bar is harder to identify as having had one too many, and
even in the case ofa patron who has ‘spent a few hours at a single
bar, “You can’t tell if they‘re drunk until they stand up,"
bartenders say.

It is time for each state, or better yet, the entire nation, to

legislate some set of uniform regulations governing the behav-.

ior of drinkers, drivers and bartenders. The emergence of such
adamant single-issue groups as M.A.D.D. (Mothers Against
Drunk Driving) points up the fact that alcohol-related auto
fatalities have reached tragic proportions, not to mention hav-
ing developed into a national embarrassment.

During the last decade, Americans have experienced a gen-
eral raising of social consciousness with respect to alcohol.
Instead of alcohol’s being perceived as one thing and drugs as
another, almost everyone has come to understand that alcohol
is a drug.

The trend toward a sharing of responsibility by bartenders
and bar owners has meant that it is now necessary for busi-
nesses to take out high-priced insurance policies against law-
suits from accident victims. One bar in downtown Pittsburgh
spends $40,000 per year for such coverage. While this is a
positive thing, each individual must ultimately assume respon-

sibility for his own actions.

Letters To The Editor

2 a.m. curfew for your own good

Wednesday’s Pitt News’editorial
reminded me that some things in this
world don't change. It amazes me
how The Pitt News editorial staff
manages to write ignorant and
inconsistent editorials week in and
week out. The one that incited me to
pick up my pen was the Wednesday,
Jan. [8 editorial “Students have
rights...and responsibilities." I will
first address the “Students have
rights“ column and hope that the
nameless writer of the first half of
the editorial is not the same name-
less writer of the contradictory
second half. -

i do not find a 2 a.m. guest restric-
tion policy in the dorms an “embar-
rassing comment on our society.”
The 2 a.m. curfew is a rule adopted
by the university in an attempt to
respect and protect the rights of all
students in the building. The institu-
tion of such a rule keeps unwelcome
guests off the floor at hours when
most students are sleeping and for-
ces guests of students not mature
enough to keep rowdy guests quiet
after 2 a.m. to leave the building.

From Where I Stand/ Mark Stroup

The fact that some students are
not mature is overly apparent in the
second half of the editorial, where it
is stated the “law should be brought
to bear against them,” referring to
students who vandalize university
property. Why is it that students are
mature enough to be without a 2
a.m. restriction in the dorms but
can't keep themselves from destroy-
ing university property’?

I do not believe the two are
entirely related, but in many ways,
they are. Let’s face facts. The restric-
tion rule is to protect all students,
mature and immature. Rules are
made by society to protect our
rights. if the vandalism around the
university were to stop, then the
need for the 2 a.m. restriction would
no longer be present. Until then, edi-
tors, grow up and realize that the
administration is not treating dorm
residents like children but only as
students it has been charged to edu-
cate and protect.

More than a clean, well lighted place

As the saying goes, “My friend
Norbert used to be disgusted, but
now he’sjust disgusting. "Something
new is always bothering him. This

_ time it's Hemingway’s Cafe, located

on Forbes Avenue where Gustine's
used to be.
“How pretentious can you get?"

i imagine many have said the same
thing about Hemingways, but when
Norbert said it, l could feel my bile
rising.

Let me explain the type of person
Norbert is. Before he left for college,
his parents bought him a London
Fog raincoat. While the London Fog
stays in the closet, Norbert wears the
overcoat he bought at the Operatun-
ity Shop. He's also the kind who
searches for the perfect hole-in-the-
wall, unaware that a bad drunk is a
bad drunk, whether he be a tax
accountant or a retired steelworker.

“Gustine‘s was such a nice place,"
Norbert said.

The fact is, l was with Norbert the
only time he set foot in Gustine's. in

the midst of my explaining to him
who Ralph Kiner was, Norbert
exclaimed, “What a drag!“

Then he marched out of the bar.
But I knew Norbert really didn't dis-
like Gustine's; he was just running
out on the bar bill.

Since I last spoke to Norbert, two
questions have occurred to me. First,
with people like Norbert, why is life
considered sacred? Second, why are
people inflamed by the mention of
Hemingway‘s?

To me, there are some obvious
annoyances. The name, for example,
just sticks in one’s craw.
Unabashedly, the owners took the
name of the 20th century's highest-
profile literary figure. Couple that
with the Tuesday night fiction and
poetry readings, and I grant you, it
does sound pompous.

But then again, in checking out
other area bars, one discovers that its
name may be no less phoney than
most:

The Wooden Keg: Don’t be fooled

by the name. The beer arrives in
aluminum kegsjust like everywhere
else.

The Sanctuary: in a pig’s eye! No
one — not even Denny Terrio —
seeks sanctuary amidst flashing
lights and a heavy bass line.

Zelda's Greenhouse: l‘ve yet to see
a plant growing there. The only
greenery is the lettuce found on the
floor on Taco Night.

Peter's Pub: Supposedly,a pubisa

place where people with similar inter-
ests bend elbows and flapjaws. More
likely, Peter’s Pub is what Pittsburgh
Magazine would politely refer to as a
“meet market."

Sam & Bernie’s: l have yet to see
the two ofthem. lseriouslydoubtthis
is a chain operation.

These last two are more aptly
named:

2 The SOD: Short, i believe, for
South Oakland Den or South Oak-

land Dive, although more colorful
and descriptive names can come to
mind while using those three initials.

Denny’s (or as the sign says,“Den-
ny‘s, Denny‘s, Denny's...): Yes, you
canfind Denny there. lfyoudon‘tget
to meet him, however, try not to feel
offended. The same applies ifyou do
get to meet him.

So Hemingway‘s may not be as
poorly named as many others. The
questionremains: Would Heming-
way have had a drink there? The
owners would like the clientele to be
mostly young and professional. Dol-
lars, but no sense. Ernest's taste in
people ran more toward the common
man. or as he would say,“the uncom-
mon common man.”

As far as drinks go, few of Papa's‘

specialties, such as gin-spiked coco-
nuts, frozen scotch and absinthe, are
served there. Probably not that many
call for them. and the FDA would
prohibit the serving of absinthe. it

causes the brain to rot (weak excuse
ifyou ask me).

in the bars favor, it does have an
extensive wine list. (Note: approach
the Rumanian Cabernet with cau-
tion; it tastes like tractor oil.) And it
has ceiling fans and brass railings,
things that have become overly
trendy but may be found in such
noted Hemingway han-gouts as
Lipp‘s Brasserie in Paris, the Florid-
ita in Havana and Sloppy Joe‘s in
Key West. Add to that the cleanli-
ness. the lighting and Ernest's fabled
ego,and l think he mayjust have had
a nip at his namesake.

I almost forgot —— the prices. To be
fair, Hemingway‘s is relatively
expensive. But that‘s no problem,
even my friend Norbert would offer
to front Papa a drink. One would
have to warn Ernest. though. He may
have spent his time in Pamplona,
Spain, but when it comes to running
out on the bills. Norbert‘s an expert.

The big chill

Last week was a tough week for
animals. In Niagara Falls. a group of
ducks was stranded on a ledge.
wings frozen, with nowhere to go
but down into the swirling depths. In
Utah, the deep freeze and heavy
snow cover have made food tough to
find for the state's deer and elk
herds. Some estimates predict that
as many as l50.000 deer and elk
might die of starvation as a result of
the cold weather. In California. a
trysting turtle was attacked by a
shark. which tore the front flippers
off the turtle and left it for dead. In
New York City. a 62-year-old
woman froze to death in her apart-
ment. The gas company had shut off
her fuel for non—payment of service.
New York City officials say that
many more destitute and homeless
people might face a similar fate
before the winter ends.

So what are we going to do about
all this‘?

The ducks, it appears, are beyond
hope. Niagara Falls officials would
send a helicopter onto the ledge to
try to rescue the birds but fear that
the swirling winds might carry the
helicopter into the Falls. If it isany
consolation. the ducks have made
national news. and people every-
where are sorry for them and would
help if anything could be done.

The deer and elk are a bit more
fortunate. Utah state game officials
have set up emergency feeding bins
along trails across the state. and the
deer and elk are catching on. Of
course. deer food does not grow on
trees. so to speak. It costs money --
as much as a halfa million dollars to
feed the deer through the winter. But
Americans are responding to this
situation. Last week. officials in
Utah announced that they have col-
lected S l 50,000 in the mail from peo-

and wish to help.

The ﬂipperless turtle is going to be
just fine. Doctors have fashioned a
new set of flippers from a rubbery
substance and surgically attached
them last week. The operation was a
success and, for a mere $200,000. we
saved the turtle from an almost cer-
tain death.

The 62-year-old woman is dead.
No amount of money will bring her
back. although a couple hundred
bucks or so delivered a few weeks
ago would have saved her for
another winter. It’s a shame that the
news media couldn’t have dug up her
story in time for someone to help her
or the countless others who continue
to freeze or starve in America.

Someday. perhaps, the media will
discover that. although they may not
be quite as loveable. people are

For The Pitt News

“Killing area is bounded by
these four streets: Fifth, Forbes,
Bigelow and Bouquet. If your
gun is seen by any person, you
are an open target,” explained
RSA representative Juli Kurdila
to a group ofTower A residents.

The residents of Tower A are
preparing to play the game
“Assassin.” There is no cause for
alarm, unless you are a Tower A
resident —t then it might be wise

to hire a bodyguard.

“lfyou leave your room alone,
you’re dead meat,“ said sixth
floor resident Mike Lis.

The rules for the game are sim-
ple. Teams consist of two
members from the dorm. Any
team can take out a contract to
kill any Tower A resident by con-
tacting the “assassin master,”

Assassin game “deadly”

for Tower A residents

“They need only a plastic dart

gun," said Tower A RSA presi-

dent John Lucki. Other than
team members, there can be no
witnesses. If you are killed, your
team is eliminated, and you must
surrender your guns and con-
tracts to the assassin master.

“Just when. you thought it was
safe to go out and study in the
evenings... Assassin,“ said Tower
A resident Andrew Morrell. The
game is complicated only by a
few rules for safety.

“You can’t kill a person while
he or she is asleep, and you can’t
wake him up to kill him," said
Giovannelli.

Outside of a few situations,
Tower A residents have few hav-
ens.

“lfyou think someone is trying
to kill you, your best bet is to go
to the bathroom," explained
Lucki. “They can’t touch you in

The hills are alive with the sound of 

Pitt’s Women’s Choral Ensemble, A
which practices Monday and Wed-

Building.

“The Women’s Choral Ensemble

is a small, informally-run group of
about I0 to 20 women who enjoy
singing," said Kathy Curiale, the
ensembles director and advisor.

The group performs all types of
music,

ranging from Broadway

numbers to pop, and even “beauty-
shop quartets.” Because of its small
membership, the singers are offered
more individualized instruction,
being that more women can perform

alone in solos as well as in groups.

Students receive college credit for
participating on the ensemble, and
no auditions or experience are
required. _

for people, because it gives them a
chance to do something other than
routine classwork,” Curiale said.

A PUBLIC SVERVIHCITE MBBSAGE FROM’ 3‘

The Pitt News, Monday, January 23, 1984

 University publishers keeppressing for success

Giant’s Rival” by Cole Blasier
and “Private Parties“ by Jona-
than Penner, have been printed
by The New York Times within
the last two months.

By Steven Shussett
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh is
publishing books and enjoying
reviews at a time when some of
its peers are experiencing set-
backs. The University of Pitts-
burgh Press is just one of the
productive facets lost in this
multi-faceted university.

According to Catherine Mar-
shall, managing editor and cur-
rentiacting director, the Press is
comparable to other university
presses of the same size.

In 1983, the Press had an aver-

To prevent any sort of literary
backscratching W meaning that
one good review could be given
in exchange for another —— Mar-
shall said that authors are not
told who the readers are, thus
giving-each reader the freedom to
say what he wants.

“Academia can't survive with-
out objectivity,” she said.

Authors are attracted to the
University Press in many ways.
The success of specific series run
by the Press is one example. The
Pitt Latin American Series has
received much publicity and has
over 30 titles in print, with addi-
tional titles appearing every year.
In l983, “Juan Peron and the
Reshaping of Argentina" by
Frederick C. Turner and Jose
Enrique Migues, won the New
England Council on. Latin
American Studies Book Award.

The University of Pittsburgh
Press is a non-profit organiza-
tion, as are most university
presses. Although 1983 sales
were $480,767, nearly all of this
went back into publishing.

Pitt history professor Dr.
Robert Colodny explained that
the importance of publishing to
gain tenure gives impetus for

5 young instructors to “deluge uni-

versity presses” in the hopes of
getting published.

Works that are not published
are not lost, he said. Manuscripts

not used by a university press are
usually placed in the university
library, as are doctoral disserta-
tions. Wide-spread use of unpub-
lished works is still possible,
however, through facilities such

as those at the University of
Michigan, where dissertations
are microfilmed, thus makirg
them available to a greater
number of scholars.

At Pitt, approximately one
quarter of the authors are affil-
iated with the university in some
way. One European author

recentlycontributed a book on
the origins of the Spanish Civil

‘War, which was not only

reprinted by a commercial press
but was also a selection ofa book

’ V club.

Both Colodny and Marshall
said that university publications
are often regional pieces. “Out of
the Furnace” is a University
Press work and deals with the
steel industry and its workers. It
was published regionally and
sold well within the tri-state
steel-producing area.

to Soviets,

By Michael Fay
For The Pitt News

Economic blockades imposed by
the United States on socialist
governments in Latin America have
produced hostility and hardships,

‘forcing socialist countries such as

Nicaragua into the arms of the

Soviet Union, according to two

guest lecturers at Pitt.

Marxist scholar Michael Lowy
and visiting Mellon Professor Claes
Brundenuis participated in a speak-
ing tour of local universities last
week. The tourwas sponsored by the
local chapter of Socialist Action, a
new national organization.

In last Thursday’s lecture entitled
“Socialism and Revolution in Latin
America," Lowy and Brundenius
said the major obstacle for socialist
movements in Latin America is the
“imperialist policy” of the U.S.
administration under President
Ronald Reagan.

Brundcnius said another four
years of Reagan will bring direct
U.S. intervention in Nicaragua.

“The Sandinista revolution is an
irreversible one. They [the Sandinis-
tas] will fight,“ Brundenius said.
“[lnvading Nicaragua] will not be as
easy as Grenada.”

Brazilian-born Lowy has written V

many articles on Latin America. He

teaches sociology at L‘Ecole des
Hautes Studes en Science Sociales in

Paris, France. Brundenius has
visited Latin America many times
and served as an ccomonic adviser to
the government of Nicaragua.

The speakers said they shared a
desire for the liberation ofexploited
workers in Latin America and said

that liberation could only be
achieved through socialist
revolution.

The major objective of the Sandi-
nista revolution in Nicaragua in

Marxist scholar Michael Lowy

Karl Kobil/' The Pitt News
spoke on socialism

and revolution in Latin America Thursday evening at
David Lawrence Auditorium.

I979. according to Lowy, was to
overthrow the current regime and
then prevent other governments and
multi-national corporations from
taking advantage of the temporarily
unstable situation.

The recent Kissinger Report doc-
uments economic levels of Latin
American governments. According
to Brundcnius, who relied on Kissin-
ger‘s statistics, U.S.-backed coun-
tries such as El Salvador, Honduras
and Guatemala are in worse eco-
nomic shape than socialist Nicara-
gua and communist Cuba.

“Cuba is no paradise,“ Brunde-
nius admitted. “However, the
Cuban government has been better
able to meet the basic needs of its
people.“

H.e said Nicaragua is the only
country in Central America with a

positive growth rate.

"There is a new era for Latin
America since the Sandinista revo-
lution in I979,” Lowy said. He de-
scribed this era as “a revolutionary
wave to the south [of Nicaragua].”

There is unrest throughout the

region, he added. 0*

The Nicaraguan revolution, Lowy
said, was “more humane"than those
in Cuba or Russia.

After the Sandinistas defeated
Anastasio Somoza, he said, there
were no mass murders or relatiations
against members of the former
regime.

“The situation in Latin America is
desperate,“ Lowy explained.

“Organization is most important at‘

this time. [Change] must wait until
the time is right.”

Lady hoopsterssplit in Dixie

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

A weekend split in Dixieland ena-
bles the Lady Panther basketball
troupe to haul a 10-7 record into the
home of the Clemson Tigers tonight
at 7:30 p.m., completing the trip
South.

Friday night, South Carolina
State became the latest victim of
Pitt’s recently acquired half-time
handicap strategy. On the strength
of Jennifer Bruce’s 30 points and
eight rebounds, Pitt topped the host
team 73-67 in overtime.

Bruce went I I for 14 from the field
and eight for nine in free throws dur-
ing a game dedicated to Chuck
Tanner. ebulient manager of the
Pittsburgh Pirates who gave an
inspiring pep talk to the Lady
Panthers last week.

The Lady Panthers trailed after 20
minutes 39-34 but tied it up at the
end of regulation time at 65-65.

Pitt traveled to South Carolina
University on Saturday, but instead
of turning around a half-time deficit,
the Lady Panthers fell further
behind and lost 75-68.

The loss came despite the highly-

improved free throw percentage of
85.7 percent, but the team’s field
goal percentage remained 43.8
percent.

Bruce led Pitt‘s scoring attack
with eight rebounds and 19 points,
including a perfect 7-7 foul-shot
mark. Stephanie Collins contri-
buted I8 points, giving her 31 on the
weekend.

Kim Gannis scored 13 in the USC
contest, and Ellen Gilhooley pitched
in with 21 points in the two games.
Kim Tirik chalked up 7 rebounds
and 11 assists against USC.

South Carolina was led by Sharon
Gi1more’s 23 points and 15
rebounds, followed by Brently
Southers’ 10 rebounds and 18
points.

Correction: In Friday’s edition of
The Pitt News, Julie Callan was mis-
takenly referred to as Kim Tirik in a
photograph.

Rozier has

” By Joe Zeff

The Pitt News

The United States Football
League's newest millionaire,
Michael Rozier, debuted Friday
afternoon at a press gathering at
Scorecard Harry's in Downtown
Pittsburgh.

Photographers crowded about his
table, looking for action photos of
this 22-year-old man eating a roast
beef and Swiss on a kaiser roll.

Beatrice Rozier, shareholder and '

mother, sipped soup from the chair
on her son’s right. Paul Martha,
Mauler president, sat to Rozier‘s

other side and handled introduc-

tions.
Around 3 p.m., the bright lights

. were finally lifted from Rozier‘s

untouched sandwich and directed
toward a podium, from which
Mauler general manager George
Heddleston officialy introduced the
object of all this attention.

“Well, I’m here now,” Rozier pro-
claimed, as his face burst into a $3.l
million smile. 2

Rozier offered the media assur-
ance that he in fact signed a three-
year contract to play football for the
Maulers. Z
‘ ‘‘I’m happy to be here in Pitts-
burgh,” he said. “I had a chance to
come to play for the Pittsburgh uni-
versity when I’ came out of high
school, but I chose Nebraska."

It was at Nebraska that Rozier
staked his claim to Cornhusker fame.

“Strong as a bull and quick as a '

cobra,” according to the school’s
media guide, he churned out 4,780
yards and 49 touchdowns in three
seasons. As a senior, Rozier tallied
2,148 yards and 29 touchdowns to
boost Nebraska to a No. 2 national
ranking. - .
His actions- at Nebraska spok

louder than his words on Friday
afternoon. Flanked by his agent, Art
Wilkinson of Philadelphia, Rozier‘s

1984 HAND-IN-HAND

Please apply THIS WEEK at the Hand-In-Hand office in Tower

little to say in appearance

were carefully monitored.

Rozier would not confirm when he
actually signed the official Mauler
contract.

“Well, l‘m not really sure now.
There’s been so much stuff in the
papers, and I’ve been travelling so
much. You know, it's been a while."

The Heisman Trophy winner
lacked the swiftness at the micro-
phone that he generated on thefoot-
ball field.

“This is my financial man — Art
Williams,” he said, directing atten-
tion to his straight-faced agent. Too
bad his name is Wilkinson.

Wilkinson, meanwhile, was a
lousy ventriloquist. His lips could be
seen moving every time his client
responded with a “no comment"to a
controversial query. The two side-
stepped questions concerning agent
Mike Trope, who negotiated the con-
tract, the Maulers’initialcontactand
the National Football League.

Rozier and Wilkinson helped little
in clarifying what actually happened
from when the Maulers first reached
Rozier to when he signed the con-
tract. The following questions
received “no comment” responses:

0 “What sort of contact did you
have with Leonard Tose of the Phil-
adelphia Eagles?"

0 “Are you saying that Tose didn't
contact you?”

0 “Are you in the process of re-
structing that deal with Trope, in
which he collected $300,000 for his
services?”

0 “When did you first meet Mike
Trope; how did the association
begin?"

0 “Was the association before the
Orange Bowl?”

0 “Why are you reluctant to talk
about the contact by the NFL?"

0 “Had your agent met with the
Mauler brass before and said to you,
‘Hey, these guys are worth listening
to.?" ’

Just what, if anything, can be
derived from Rozier‘s reluctance to
address those questions?

No comment. —

Mullin not enough in Hoya rout I

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

NEW YORK —- St. John's
often prides itselfin calling Madi-
son Square Garden its second
home. There's that 240-129
record in the famed complex and
an eight-game win streak that
died Dec. 29 against Nor,th Carol-
ina(l3-0).

And the people who show upat
the Garden often liken to calling
the Redmen their own. Their col-
lege basketball team.

That’s why it seemed somehow
odd that a spectator —— one of
l5,90l in attendance to see
Georgetown play — stood up
after the public address
announcer blurted out Hoya cen-
ter Patrick Ewing’s game
accomplishments upon fouling
out with two minutes remaining.

That spectator yelled, -“How
many points did Mullin have?”

Two rows back, the reply was
instantaneous: “Not enough to
win. That’s all that matters.”

Chris Mullin, St. John’s nim-
ble guard and [983 Big East
MVP, scored 26 points, as he did
for a season high against Pitt last
week. And it wasn’t enough. The

“We hit our shots; what a dif-
ference it makes,” said a somber-
faced John Thompson,
Georgetown’s head coach.
“Things went our way. I can’t say
more than that. We got accomp-
lished what we wanted.”

Which meant that when
_Ewing, the country’s premiere
center, was double- and triple-
teamed, the Hoyas could depend
upon others to shoot and convert

from the floor. Prior to the game,

only one other besides Ewing -
center Ralph Dalton — was mak-
ing at least 60 percent of his shots.

Scoring 14 points each were
forward David Wingate and
guard Michael Jackson.

For the game’s first l0 minutes,
St. John's did a credible job at
keeping Ewing away -from the
boards, building an impressive
six-point lead (23-I 7) with 7:35 to
go after falling behind 8-2. It was
mostly the Mullin show, with the
junior canning 13 points in the
first half. Key, too, were the five
assists by senior center JeffAllen.

Eventually Ewing started find-
ing his holes and Jackson started
findingthe nylon,contributing2l

points lead at halftime. '

 

It became evident in the game‘s
final 20 minutes that St. John’s
would need more than Mullin to
wear down the talent-laden
Hoyas. Alreadythe Red men were
without the services oftheir other
center, 7-0 Bill Wennington, out
for the past two weeks with an
ankle injury.

Forward Ron Stewart wasn’t
the answer, either, as each time he
was double-covered, that was
worth two points to the Hoyas.

St. _John’s held its deficit to
about eight points until nine min-
utes into the half. Then George-
town blew their doors off.
Wingate started laying in l3-foot
jumpers and Ewing added to the
nine points gotten in the first half.
He finished with l8 points, 10
rebounds and six blocked shots.
In other words, just another day
at the office.

“It’s a challenge for me to play
well every game, not just this
game," Ewing remarked. “I
always like to be in the offensive
flow. I try to pick my spots
because I know every time I get
the ball, people are collapsing
back on me.”

Thompson saw his challenge of
the day as containing the explo-
sive Mullin. 2

“We wanted Gene [Smith,
senior uard to den himtheball

Sears

   
 

when he didn’t have it and jam
him when he did," Thompson
said. “He's not a machine, but he
is good.”

“The game is 40 minutes long
and one guy can't win it by him-
self,” said St. John’s head coach
Lou Carnesecca. “We need more
out of the other people."

Carnesecca didn’t get that Sat-
urday afternoon. Second behind
Mullin was guard Mike Moses
(eight), while three others fin-
ished with seven points apiece.

“When you play a club like
Georgetown, your margin of
error has to be small,”Carnesecca
added. “You have to assume they
will utilize what they have against
you. They have a relentless
attack.

“They are playing with more
poise than last year and their
rebounding strength is better.”

Part of this indominatble cast
is freshman Reggie Williams,
who poured in 13 points and
added five rebounds mostly dur-
ing the l7 minutes he played inthe
second half. The_Hoyas are now
15-2, 4-1 in the Big East and play

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

Despite winning on all four
events, the Lady Panther gym-

5 nasts lost at Michigan State on

Saturday. An apparent lack of
depth caught Pitt off guard,
resulting in the unusually close
meet, with less than one point
separating the two teams.
Technical problems in the
team’sfirsteventalsocontributed
to the final score, Pitt 174.25-
Michigan l75.20, according to
gymnast Sara Strickland.

“We did excellent, but the vault
was shaky,” said Strickland. “We
had trouble with the board, and
Lisa Shirk didn't make either of
her vaults. After that, we were
pretty nervous. It really hurt us."

Several gymnasts put on high-
scoring performances, enabling
Pitt to win the four events. High-
lighting Pittsburgh‘s display was
Babbi Flock’s near-perfect score
on the floor exercise: 9.75.

Lady Panthers defeat

adversity, Clarion, 74-66,

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

The Lady Panther swimming and
diving team entered Saturday’s meet
against Clarion at Tree’s Hall with
the belief that it would be a fiercely-
contested match.

What Pitt coach David Belowich
and the hundred or so spectators on
hand witnessed was a coming
together of sorts for a young Lady
Panther team whose record now
stands at4-1 aftertheirthrilling74-66
victory over the four-time defending
NCAA Division II national cham-
pion Eagle team.

“It's nice to win, but we accomp-
lished a lot more than that," Belo-
wich said. “We became a team. I
believe a team is [a group] that can
overcome some adversity. There is
some more emotion that goes beyond
just getting into the water.”

Pitt certainly faced "adversity

' Saturday.

Patricia Ney, .a freshman diver,
while competing in the one-meter
event, attempted a ﬂip on her third
dive in a series of six. She hit her right
index finger on the board, probably
causing a break, with the severity yet.
to be determined. Ney later pulled
out of the three-meter board compe-
tition after completing her final three
dives on the one-meter platform and
experiencing quite a bit of pain‘ in the
process.

Stacy Moller, another freshman,
hyperventilated and suffered a con-

cussion after hitting her head on a
cement wall while fainting. Moller
experienced that following a win in
the I000-yard freestyle (l0:3l.63)
and a second [(2211.17) in the 200-
yard butterﬂy. She was later held out
of the 500-yard freestyle as a result.

Despite the setbacks, the Lady
Panthers, specifically Jennifer
Brown and Chris Kaucher, picked up
the slack with clutch performances in
the closing events.

Brown, competing in her first sea-
son as a diver, won both the one- and
three-meter contests, the first time
she has accomplished that this
season.

“I‘m just happy that we won both
events," Brown said. “It wouldn't
have mattered tome if I had placed
second or third in the events, just so
we got the points. Maybe if it were
Penn State, then I would have liked
to have won both.”

With Moller out, the pressure fell
on the shoulders of Kaucher in the
500-yard freestyle. With three events
remaining, Clarion maintained a leg-
itimate shot at pulling off a come-
from-behind victory.

Kaucher erased those possibilities
with a stellareffort as she touched
first in a time of 5:l2.5l, nipping
Clarion's Sue Gallagher (5213.99)
and Kim Hayes (5:l4.5l).

“I knew that the team needed a lift
from me," Kaucher said. “I knew I
couldn’t let up. I made sure of it.“

“It's a lot different for swimmers.

They don't get a lot of recognition,”
Belowich explained. “The process of
goalsetting, especially for the fresh-
men, is difficult because it comes
from inside." P

A lot of the Lady Panthers were
digging deep inside.

“They’re what we call PBTs, and
PBTs are personal best times," Belo-
wich said. “We had a whole lot of
PBTs. Eventhe people whodidn‘tget
them were real close."

The Lady Panthers were led by a
trio of freshmen.

Jodi O'Neil won three events (the
100- and 200-yard breaststroke in
1:07.73 and 2:24. l4,respectively,and
the 400-yard individual medley in
4:37.70) outright and combined with

400—yard medley relay (4:00.59).

“Every meet is a stepping stone for
us,” O’Neil said. “And today was one
of those stones. I was happy for the
team."

Hickman also captured the two
sprints, the 50- and I00-yard free-
style. The 50-yard time of 23.85 was
good enough to qualify for the
NCAA trials.

“There‘s pressure when you're on a
team as close as ours," Hickman said.

“But it’s a good type of pressure. It‘s
more ofa desire to win in some ways.

The Pitt men's track team’s Roger
Kingdom is quickly becoming one of
the most feared hurdlers in the
country.

At the Eastman Kodak Invita-
tional on Saturday in Johnson City,
Tenn., he again proved that there
can’t be too many better as he dis-
posed of the 60-yard hurdle field with
his best time of the young season,
7.1 I.

It was there, one year ago, that
Kingdom qualified for the‘NCAA
championships with a time of 7.22
but failed to reach the finals.

Saturday’s final heat included
Reggie Townes of Tennessee and
Martin Booker of Villanova, among
others. .

“The girls ran well," he said.
Junior Renee Henderson placed
third in the semi-finals of the 60

at this meet, she became more
aggressive.“

A runner from Athletics West

who won the 60-yard dash, broke
the record with a time of (6.70

tition at East Tennessee.

Freshman Edith Butler placed

By Mark A. Slndler
The Pitt News

NEW YORK ——- The Pantherbas-
ketball team not only launched itself
on the right foot in overpowering
Seton Hall Saturday 71-59 but rea-
died itself for all-important confer-
ence battles with Syracuse and
Georgetown later this week.

Before several hundred spectators
at Madison Square Garden, Pitt (I I-
4 and 2-3 in the Big East) unloaded
fast and early on the Pirates enroute
to the thrashing. In an undercard
battle to the Georgetown-St. John’s
clash, the Panthers did some
climbing. . .

First, Pitt bettered its horrid 43
percent success rate from the field
going into the game by shooting 56
percent. The defense entered the con-

test allowing opponents 57 percent
from the field but held the Pirates to
40.4.

Second, Pitt vacated the basement
environs and moved into afifth-place
tie with St. John’s and Connecticut
— important because Syracuse and
Georgetown, Nos. I and 2 in the
conference standings, are comingjto
Pitt. -

“The win today makes those games
very big,” said guard Billy Culbert-
son, who was one ofthe three Panth-
ers to hit in the double figures with I0

points.

“The win gives us momentum,
especially against Syracuse,"
repeated center Keith Armstrong.
“We need the momentumjust to be
ready for their kind of game."

Armstrong will be part of these
Wednesday and Saturday biggies,
though lately he hasn’t exactly been
leading the way as role model.

Coming off a two-game scoring
drought, the 6-9 sophomore contrib-
uted eightpoints and five reboundsin
a game the control of which Pitt
never lost.

Jumping out to a 26-17 lead at the
5:54 mark of the first half, Pitt built
itself al 4-point lead before intermis-
sion, only temporarily putting to rest
the Pirates‘ misery. Score: 39-27. The
picnic-sized crowd easilyjustified its
resounding yawn.

Early on, the Panthers knew
guards Ransom Eaves and Mike
Jones, running Seton Hall’s fast-
break brigade, would have to be
stopped for Pitt to maintaindomina-
tion. And stifled they were.

Holding Jones scoreless through-
out and Eaves to onlyfour points, the
Panthers built 19- and 23-point leads
in the second half.

“A lot of our offense came off our
defense,” said Pitt head coach Roy
Chipman. “This was the best defense
I've seen since Illinois State. And
[Seton Hall] runs the break probably
as well as anybody.”

  Panthers power past Seton Hall

to come. His guards, starters Cul-
bertson and Cu-rtis Aiken, as well as
Joey David and George Allen, will
serve as integral parts against Syra-
cuse and Georgetown.

“Thegame/plan was for us to go
out and shutout Eaves," Culbertson
said. “He'd be playing one corner,
and every time, we made sure we had
someone on him."

“The key for us right now," Chip-
man continued, “is our guards. They
went on a sabbatical for a game
[against Connecticut]. Now they’re
aggressive and taking it to the teams.
They’re able to run the team, alter-
nate guys and wear them down."

Allen, especially. Eleven of his I3
points cameinthe second half,and he
had a perfect five-of-five from the
line.

“They're doing the job the last
three games," Chipman said. “I'm
very satisfied.”

Another encouragment was Chip-
man’s use of forward Clyde
Vaughan. For the first time in
memory, Vaughan‘s 38-minute aver-
age suffered a setback when the All-
America candidate saw action for
‘‘only’' 31 minutes.

He did, however, score I8 points
and showed no signs of favoring a
right ankle that people contend was
seriously sprained at Villanova. But
then again, this is Clyde Vaughan,
founder of the work ethic.

“Everybody’s working hard, that’s
what's doing it,” he said in anticipa-
tion of the upcoming week's events.
“When we think of Georgetown, we
only think of them as a team. They
may be a great team, but they’re still
only a team.“

“This win starts the week off on a
good note,” forward Chip Watkins
said after contributing four points
despite fouling out. “We were play-
ing to win it. The last time we came
out to play around I2 [UConn], we
were still asleep.”

The truth hurts when you have to
admit it.

“The last time we had a I2 o'clock
game, we didn’t get up till 3:30,”
Chipman cracked. “But we learned
our lesson the first time."

Not only that, the Panthers started
a new trend after that UConn disas-
ter. The new fad is team meetings ——
without the coaches.

“We worry too much about what
people say about us," Culbertson
said, referring to newspaper clip-
pings and callers to Chipman’s
weekly talk show. “Maybe it would
be better if we ignored all that stuff."

By the end of next weekend, the
choice words will be either distinctly
pro or con. A
OFF THE BOARDS: Pitt's latest
signing, 6-10 Charles Smith from
Bridgeport, Conn., drove down with
his coach from Warren Harding
High School to watch the game
 Darryl Shepherd spelled Vaughan
for about five minutes but failed to
score...;With about three minutes
remaining in the game, Chipman
started dusting off the bench.
Reserves Steve Beatty, Jeff Robin-
son, Marlon Ferguson and John
Blanton all saw action.

Thanks to you...
it works...

Senior Ed Bahan was part of four wins as the Panther swim team ‘defeated LaSa1le, 73-48 Saturday at Trees Pool.

Panther tankers drown LaSalle

By Charlie o'Hara
The Pitt News

For the second straight week, the
Panther swimming and diving team
proved that it could well be the best
team in the east as it overwhelmed
LaSalle at Trees Hall on Saturday by
a score of 73-38.

And for the second straight week.
senior Ed Bahan cleaned the clocks
of the opposers’ anchor leg in the
final event, the 400-yard freestyle
relay. He also won the 50- and 100-
yard freestyle races in 21.66 and
46.94, respectively.

“We’re gonna miss him next year,"
Pitt coach Fred Lewis said of Bahan.
“This is the second year in a row he’s
done this. Last year, he won on the
anchor leg three weeks in a row
against Penn State, LaSalle and

Heisman Trophy winner Mike Rozier finally
made an appearance in Pittsburgh, but he
wouldn't say if any of those rumors were true

West Virginia. This year, he’s done it
against Penn State and LaSalle.”

On Saturday, the Panthers travel
to West Virginia.

Despite the preseason number 15
Eastern ranking, an obvious mis-

take, the Panthers (5-0) are winning
and improving as they work toward
the Big East championships, the
Eastern qualifiers and,hopefully,the
NCAA finals.

From the outset on Saturday, Pitt
set the tone as they buried the Explor-
ers in the 400-yard relay by a seven-
second margin. The team of Ed
Bergan, Donald Martin, Rick James
and J.D. McCrillis posted a winning
time of 3:32.17. That put Pitt up by
seven points. They never needed to
look back.

“Yeah, l‘m happy we won, but I'm
disappointed looking at some ofthe
times we swam," Lewis remarked.
“We didn’t let up [in our training] to

“From the energy of the freshmen to the
experience of the seniors, we have a very well

rounded team ”

rest for this meet; maybe we might
just have overworked.”

Despite Lewis’ intolerance for
almost anything but perfection, he
surrendered. revealing some good
efforts by his Panthers.

‘‘I’m pleased with how Rick James
swam." he said. “I expect his times to
drop, though.”

James won the 200—yard individ-
ual medley (l:55.68) and the 200-
yard backstroke (l:53.69).

“[1] thought we really came
through in the diving situation,”
Lewis added. “Jeff Luffey was a tre-

mendous suprise. And Chris Blair.
he's looking real good.” V —

The Panther divers took 16 of a
possible 18 points from the one-and
three"-meter platforms.

‘Todd Mulzet won the one-meter
event with a total of 247.20 and Blair
was second (242.38). On the three-
meter board, Mulzet was second
(267.75) to teammate Luffey (28 l .7).

“Todd [Mulzet] and Chris [Blair]
are doing a whale of a job,” diving
coach Julian Krug said. “[Actually],
we have about seven divers who
could very well be the number one

all season. At any meet, any of them
are capable of winning either event.
lt‘s an outstanding position to be in
as a coach."

Other noteworthy performances
turned in:

Martin was a double winner. He
won the 200-yard breaststroke
(2:08.33) and the 200-yard freestyle
(l:44.00). Bergan was a member of
the two winning relay teams in addi-
tion to placing second in the 200-yard
backstroke (1254.04).

“This is probably the best team l‘ve
ever been on,”Bahan said. “Fr mthe
energy ofthe freshman to the experi-
ence of the seniors, we have a very
well-rounded team. Although we
didn’t havethetype ofintensitytoday
that we had against Penn State. we

had enough to win. We won, and .
we’ll be ready for West Virginia next "

week. They’ve beaten us two years in
a row.”
