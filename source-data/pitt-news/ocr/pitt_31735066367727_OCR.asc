School of Nledicine Receives

Richard Mellon Foundation Gift

Teaching and .research programs in physiology at the
University’s School of Medicine will be strengthened as a
result of a gift from the Richard King Mellon Foundation,
totalling over one million dollars.

A portion of the funds has been used to create an en-
dowed professorship to be known as the Richard Beatty Mel-

lon Professorship in Physiology,0

in honor of the late R. B. Mellon.

“This generous support to the
medical school will permit us to
fulﬁll a long-sought goal, a new
and separate Department of
Physiology,” said Chancellor Ed-

(Award H. Litchﬁeld. “The gift re-

ﬂects the continued interest
shown by the Mellon family in
the University’s Health Center.

Announces Appointment -

“Since physiology is basic to’

medical education, to all medical
research, and the proper practice
of medicine and surgery and their
specialized "components, this de-
velopment will provide a sound
base for the expansion of the var»-
ious activities in all clinical de-
partments of the School.

“The endowed professorship
will perpetuate the name of one
of Pittsburgh’s foremost citizens
who has been inﬂuential in the
growth and development of this
city and its Health “Center.

“I am pleased to announce the
appointment of Dr. Ernst Knobil
as the ﬁrst Richard Beatty Mel-

lon Professor of Physiology,” Dr.

Litchﬁeld announced.

Tax Removal Drive

By JIM NELSON
being circulated by Student Govern-

A petition is now

MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1961

ment to enlist students’ support in an effort to eliminate the
four per cent sales tax on school supplies and textbooks.

" When the petition is completed, it will be presented to
Senator Joseph Ripp of Allegheny County who is supporting

On Jan. 16, 1961-, the issue of
sales tax exemption on school
supplies and text books was
brought up in the Pennsylvania
State House of Representatives
by representatives Sherman, Gel-
fand, Goldstein, and Gibb. It is
presently being discussed on the
House Ways and Means Commit-
tee. \

' Expensive Proposition

Student Government is interest-
ed in removing this sales tax be-
cause, as the petition states, “Ob~
taining an education is, in itself,
a very expensive proposition, and
with the added burden of the
rising cost of text books and sup-
plies and the rising percentage of
taxes, the burden
more diﬂicult each year.”

When_the sales tax was im-

posed in 1958, it was three per
cent. Since then it has been
raised to three and one half
percent, and more recently to
four. per cent. -

The petition is restricted to
Pennsylvania residents because
the tax is a state tax.

Diplomas Discussed

The Senate decided Monday
that the Student Government
sponsored freshman index and
guide will contain. a_ calendar, in-
dex, and freshman pictures. S

A suggestion was made that
two forms of the publication be

compil_ed—one with an index,
calendar, and freshman pic-
tures, and one without fresh-
man, pictures. -

tion that the Senate protest the

Dr. Willian W. Wells, asso-
ciate professor of biohhemis-
try. at the University’s School
of Medicine has been granted
an Established Investigator-

Association for research in “La-
coste Diets and Cholesterol. Meta-
bo1ism.”

Announcement of the grant was
made recently by Western Penn-
sylvania Heart Association and the
University.

Dr. ‘/Jells. who will be engaged
in this research “study for ﬁve
years, is one of 103 Established
Investigators throughout 26 states,
the District of Columbia, and

such an award. .
According to Dr. Wells, con-
sidcrable attention has been fo-
cuscd recently on the signiﬁ-
cance of the quantity and qual-
‘ ity of dietary fat in its relation-
ship to degenerative heart dis-
ease. “
The goal of this project is to

relationship between intake of
milk sugar and the incidence of
coronary arterial thrombosis.
,“Many of our own American pop-
ulation can beregarded as heavy
milk drinkers,” Wells stated.

It hasnow been demonstrated
that experimental animals fed
lactose (milk sugar) and cho-
lesterol develop more extensive
degeneration of the arteries
than comparable animals fed
cane sugar and cholesterol. '

Results of such an experiment
show that a fairly strong relation-
-ship between these observations
and the activity of the micro-or-
ganisms of the intestine.

The present project will be an
extension of these findings in ex-
perimental animals to the situation
in humans.

Housing Plans

The Dean of lVlcn’s Office is ex-
panding its services in providing
off-campus housing for University
students, Dr. William B. Crafts,
Director of Student Affairs, an-
nounced today. . '

“Because of the substantial in-
crease in freshman registrations,"
the higher percentage of upper,
classmen who desire dormitory
rooms, and the larger number «of
graduate students coming to the
University, we are becoming con-
cerned about the housing situation
and are looking for more openings
oﬂ’ campus,” he said.

The Dean of Men’s Office pro.
vides a list of all off-campus ac-
commodations which are available
for students. This listing, mode;--
ate at present, is being expanded
and the office has become “more
actively engaged” in looking for
rooms in faculty and staff homes
as well as in rooming houses and
apartments. . V
L “In time we hope to have a fun
scale off—campus program and that
our present list of openings will
grow. In addition, we are becom-
ing more concerned about the ac-
commodations themselves, espec-
ially in regard to cleanliness, safe-
ty and comfort,” Dr. Crafts con-
tinued.

Under the improved system,
however, students must still take
the initiative and should contact
the Dean of Men’s Office, 801 C1,
to see the area housing lists.

7070 Plays Checkers, QUBIC

at Computer Games Help

Programminglllethods

By JIM HUFNAGEL

“It’s no fun playing games with a computer,” says Wil-
liam B. Kehl, director of the University’s Computation and
Data Processing Center, and landlord to one of the largest
university—owned “electronic brains” in the country.

Here, as elsewhere, the men who “program” computers

such as checkers
three dimensional tic-tac-toe.

Why isn’t it any fun?

“Well for one thing,’ says Dr.
Kehl, “it’s difficult ,to winvafter
the machine has learned the
game, and , for another, this isn’t
the tomfoolery it sounds like.

Computer Sings Too

When the programmers devise
games to play with the computer,
they actually have a serious pur-
pose in mind. It enables them to
develop new forms of program-

-fming, to see what the machine

can be made to do. In other
words, the games are a ‘form of
programming research.”
The University’s experts also
recently taught their computer
to play the song “Dixie,” elec-
tronically. This is‘ how they did
it: ,
Different types of calculations
produce varied numbers of elec-
trical impulses, or cycles per sec-
ond, in the machine. For instance,
the University’s new IBM 7070
computer can add or subtract
more than 16,000 ﬁve-digit num-
bers per second, producing im-
pulses at an equal number‘ of

‘ cycles per second.

Led to Law Library

By converting these impulses
into sound, and by ‘varying the
type of calculation (and therefore
the number of impulses—per-sec-
ond produced), the machine can
be made to re-create every tone
within the range of human hear-
ing. By feeding calculations into

.» ,amuse themselves by teaching the machine to play games,
and QUBIC,’

the brain in a planned sequence,
it can be made to produce a spe-
ciﬁc song.

One technique originally de-
vised this way, which has since
been applied in earnest, is data
retrieval. It started. when the
programmers stored the con-
tents ol‘ a documentin the ma-
chine and then tried to see if
the machine could tell how
many times.a speciﬁc word ap-
peared and in what context. _

This led to experiments with
an ellectronic law library. By
storing ‘legislation or case law in
the machine and then asking the
computer to ﬁnd the places where
key words appear, the‘UniVersity
researchers have developed a
time-saving method of locating
legal precedents.

‘Okay, Let’s Go’

With _ this
lawyers may save many hours of

library research, and the tech-.

nique may be used for other
types of. information research.

When playing QUBIC with
the machine-, a programmer
types on a computer’s keyboard,
“We’re going to play QUBIC.”
The machine will answer,
“Okay, let’s go!” Later when
the computer wins the game (as
it always does), it types out,
“Better luck next time!”

When asked what are the basic
computer principles involved in
this exchange, Dr. Kehl replies,
“Oh, there’s nothing serious about
that. That’s pure tomfoolery.”

lftdte of Taxes

Support;“House l1” or “Senate 135” suggest Student
Government members, presently soliciting students to sign
petitions. ‘

This solicitation is part of a state wide campaign of col-
lege students to back" Pennsylvania legislators proposing
that the state exempt school books and supplies from a four
per cent sales tax._ ' '

Since the University’s Book Center provides no dis-
count rate on textbooks, paper and pencils, signing this
petition could diminish one of the many bills students pay
every. term. I

zln fact, state approval could serve as a catalyst to
further deductions. Lessoning student’s ﬁnancial burden

   

indicates that these legislators are doing a service for those 

pursuing an education. Like all other non-proﬁt organiza-

. tions, the state’s success lies with its services.

Yet, our own University Book Center seems rather con-
fused about a non—proﬁt organization’s role. When students
attempted to gain a ten per cent deduction on supplies last
year, Paul Boltacz, Book Center manager, said, “Students
are guided by the misconception that theBook Center should
be ‘a service rather than a proﬁt—making ‘organization. But
few students realize that all proﬁts are replaced in the cur-
rent funds of the University and pumped back for student
use in lounges, cafeterias . . .” ,

But if an organization prefers to give students the cash
directly, rather than say, “see that park, that’s a result of
the four per cent tax that you pay to the state on books,”
then thispapproval could serve as a precedent for the Uni-
versity’s Book Center also allowing a deduction.

Since a proﬁt making organization is not essential to
the University’s educational purposes, the revenue man

A» would visit our Book Center if'it admitted at proﬁt. That

revenue‘ man visited us when we owned the Wildwood Club.
So, by just signing a petition, students could_start_ a
revolution in discounts on teXtbooks——ﬁrst the state, then
the Book Center. ‘

Rumor Clinic

 
 

- By CHUCK DUNBAR

Rumor ﬂies faster than the speed of sound. It
penetrates to the heart of the issue‘ without touch-
ing the outlying provinces of fact which compose
the issue as an integrated whole; It hits home
despite its limited scope and obvious lack of evi-
dence. Whether it oppose or
support the immediate problem,
its truth is seldom questioned.

Rumor is a power tool in the
hands of the ‘uninitiated, ‘those
who fail to comprehend the com-
plications which may accompany
those seemingly harmless words.
People take pride in possessing
secretive knowledge; it provides
special insight unavailable under
ordinary circumstances. A rumor
has been known to break many a

 

man, perpetuate many a crime, and change history— <

making decisions.

But every once in a while, rumor, the black-
guard of language, beneﬁts both its creators and
propagators. Such may turn out to be thepcase with
current whispers concerning the Student Union.
Wifhouf Reservafion 9 . _ -

Here is the whole rumor without reservation;
whether it will injure the University or not is for
the reader to decide, but nevertheless it is in stu-
dent interest that the question be opn to discussion.

Take it-or leave it; but we believe it is close to,‘ if .

not, the truth.

Plans were promised for the year 1961, plans
for a new Student Union. As of now the director
of the Student Union has not seen these plans, nor
are any imminent ih either the near or distant fu-
ture.  .

Eventually there will be a new Union, but funds
allocated to graduate buildings have shelved any
construction of a ‘SU building within the next ten
years. And, when such building is constructed it
will probably be located on the hill in the Field
House area, rather far from the student center of
activities, to say the least.

But of what concern is this; we still possess the

present SU. Here is where the rumor achieves its__

impact. Shortage of dorm space’ creates a pressing
need for more rooms.‘ Whereare these rooms com-
ing from, if new dormitories haven't been built

(and they won’t be?) The four ﬂoors of the Stu— ‘

dent Union are slated- for conversion into a dorm.

The bureaucracy of the 12th ﬂoor, the Dean of
»Women’s Ofﬁce, wants these ﬂoors now occupied by
the Student Union and other student activity
groups, and most likely they will get their desires.
This would mean the entire ‘first floor occupied by
the women’s administration, and the res}; of the
building ﬁlled with coeds, leaving the present oc-
cupants homeless. -

Perhaps the offices of the Union will be rele-
gated to the subterranean depths of the Cathedral

basement. But this still does not solve the problem
of lounges for the commuter, student services, and
recreational facilities conducive to a college at_
mosphere. 

After several years of concentrated effort the
University managed to realize one of its aims, an
established Student Union with an active clientel,
The concept of a Union, a place with an atmosphere
of recreation where students find relief from the
drudgery of the academic life, has grown to be a

‘vital factor in the American institution of higher

learning.
By shuffling student activity groups off to the

  
     
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
   
   

 
 

o‘

Cathedral basement and annihilating recreation, W

the University has defeated itself.

The problem now focuses on educational theory,
Does the University exist for the furtherance of
knowledge, or for its own materialistic gains? Ob-
viously, the former is the correct answer, but

knowledge ‘is furthered through the medium 915-‘

the student. Therefore it follows that the Univer-
sity should stimulate its students toward the goal
of knowledge by providing a college life reconcila-
ble to this aim, and not destroy it at the founda-
tion. Ten years of students will be inconvenienced
and, several years of labor will be scrapped, thanks
to a.~lack of foresight‘ and a tendency of the ad-
ministration to overlook advancement in the student
affairs area in favor of materialistic progress.

Who makes the sacriﬁce? Certainly not the Deanv;

of Women. Again it is the student, but not willingly,
for his actions are dictated by the area of student
affairs, his old nemesis. This title-laden bureauc-
racy simulates a working organization striving for
better student relations, and bears all the trappings
of such. '

Cuf Hs Throaf , .

However, it seems willing to cut its own throat
by merely -obliterating one of its most valuable as-
sets, the Student Union. What sort of Garguanta
controls this group?

Here again rumor rears out of turmoil, for
there’s a shake-up in the wind in student affairs.
It will spread," as so much of rumor does, through

the Tuck Shop grapevine, and some people, may be '

dragged through the mud, perhaps unjustly, but

I it is inevitable. .. t

If

This shake-up and the Student Union crisis may‘

. indicate the need for a change, but, remember, they

are presently only rumor and should be treated as
such. .

‘Still it leads back to the old hypothesis, “Does 7

the end justify the means?” Is the University will-
ing to forsake a Student Union well underway at
this stage, and lower the prestige of student affairs,
which harbors on the core of education. _

Rumor runs wild. Let us hgpe that this one is
accepted sensibly, and squelched if untrue. But
perhaps if it approaches the truth, then let, us
hope that it will serve the purpose of realigning
values in the "Union crisis. '

Questioned F_urH1e»r,
Editor, The Pitt News:

If a person violates the stand-
ards of our society he will be
brought to justice and if found
guilty this person will have to

suffer the consequences of this
violation. Adolf Eichmann acted
in a society in which it was ap-
parently no crime to exterminate

'Je;ws, otherwise it would seem

logical that he would have been
tried and found guilty by some
court of the society in which he
lived and committed A these
crimes.‘

Today one nation-on this earth
is trying to make everyone live
according to its standards —— Is-
rael whose standards were set up
after these crimes were commit-
ted. These standards are not
even international. Otherwise Is-
rael would haveirespected the
right of extradition of Argen-
tina and not have kndnapped
Eichmann. (Now the United
States of American could try Is-
rael for kidnapping, ﬁnd her
guilty and condemn her to
death.) Mr. Firestone says that
these crimes were committed
against Jews correct. But
please remember thatpthese peo-
ple were of the .Iewish faith and

not citizens of the state or Israel

 

 
   

 

should not forget what has hap-
pened in Germany between 1933
and 1945 but Israel makes this
trial look like an act of revenge
for the death of members of the
Jewish faith. Revenge — is it
acceptable. in the Jewish reli-
gion?

Perhaps the best solution to
the legal and moral problem
would come about if Israel had
forced the trial, through diplo-
matic channels, into the hands of
the German government, thus
presenting the world with a pre-
cedent for correct international
legal procedure.

Cheerleaders Defendecl
Against ‘News’ Attack

Editor, The Pitt News:

Your recent attack against the
Pitt cheerleaders was unwar-
ranted and illogical. In addition,
The Pitt News and its staff are
guilty of the very thing the
cheerleaders were criticized for.

To say that it is the cheer-
leaders’ fault that there is no
school spirit is ridiculous. They
make an honest effort, but it is
the student body that does not
respond. And the idea of having

even has to be said about this
idea, it is soiridiculous. In ref-
erence to the pep rally after we
beat Syracuse, I don’t know
where. you were, but I saw the.
cheerleaders out in. front of the
band leading the rally. ,

Furthermore, d e n y i n g the
cheerleaders of one or two trips
is unfair. They deserve a reward

for the many hours of practice’

and work they do. You seem to.

forget how much money is ap-
propriated to The Pitt News and
the beneﬁts that some of its staff
derive. Not that paper or staff is
not deserving. They certainly
are! But how can you criticize
another student activity f01'
wanting the same beneﬁts YOU
are receiving?

Finally, if anyone is in a posi-
tion to create school spirit, it
is The Pitt News. I can’t seem
to recall, however, anything be-
ing done this year. Why don’t
you start school spirit
paigns or run some sort of con-
test to attract student interest.

If you can’t ﬁnd better and
more intelligent things to Write
about, it would be advisable ‘I0
skip an editorial once in a while.
Not too many people will miSS

 On Campus with

(Author of “I Was a Teen-age Dwa-rf,”.“The Many
Loves of Dobie (r'illis,” etc.)

A ROBE BY ANY OTHER NAME

As C‘-ommencement Day draws near, the question on eVcryon.c’s
lips is: “How did the different disciplines come to be marked by
academic robes with hoods of different colors?” Everybody—~
but everybody-is asking it. I mean I haven’t been able to walk
ten feet on any campus in America without somebody grabs my
elbow and says, “How did the different disciplines come to be
marked by academic robes with hoods of different colors, hey?’5

This, I must say, is not the usual question asked by collegians
who grab my elbow. Usually they say, “Hey, Shorty, got a
Marlboro?” And this is right and proper. After all, are they not
collegians, and, therefore, the-nation’s leaders in intelligence
and discernment? And do not intelligence and discernment de-
mand the tastiest in tobacco ﬂavor and smoking pleasure? And
does not Marlboro deliver a ﬂavor that is uniquely mellow, 0.
selectrate ﬁlter that is easy drawing, a pack that is soft, a box
that is hard? You know itl

0%

But I digress. Back to the colored hoods of academic robes.
A doctor of philosophy wears blue, a doctor of medicine wears
green, a master of arts wears white, a doctor of humanities wears
crimson, a master of library science wears lemon yellow. Why?
Why, for example, should a niaster of libra ry science wear lemon
yellow? 

Well sir, to answer this vexing question, we must go back to
March 29, 1844. On that date the first public library in the
United States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr.
Sigafoos’s neighbors were of course wildly grateful-all, that
is, except Wrex Todhunter.

Mr. T odhunter had hated Mr. Sig-afoos since 1822 when both

' men had wooed the beautc-ous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had

chosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr.
Sigafoos knew all the latest steps, like the Missouri Compromise
Mambo, the Shay’s Rebellion Schottisc-he, and the James K.
Polk Polka, while Mr. Todhuntcr, alas, could not dance at all
owing to :1 wound he had received atythc Battle of New Orl<x‘1us.
(lie was struck by a falling prztline.)

Consumed with jealousy at the success of I\lr.lSig,n.i'oo.s’s
library, Mr. Todhuntcr resolved to open a competing library.
This he did,'but he lured not a. single patron away from Mr.
Sigafoos. “What has Mr. Sigafoos got that I haven't got?” Mr.

Todhuntcr kept asking himself, and finally the answer came to '

him: books. ,

So Mr. T odhunter stockeijl his library with lots of dandy books
and soon he was doing; more business than his hated rival.
But Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began
serving tea free of charge at his libmry every afternoon. There-
upon, Mr. Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea
with sugar. Thereupon, Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with
sugar and cream. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter began serving
tea with sugar and cream and lemon.

This, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. Todhunter be-
cause he had the only lemon tree in town-in fact, in the entire
state of North Dakotawand since that day lemon yellow has of
course been the color on the academic robes of library science.

(Incidentally, the defeated Mr. Sigafoos packed up his library
and moved to California where, alas, he failed once more. There
were, to be sure, plenty of lemons to servewith his tea, but,
alas, there was no cream because the cow was not introduced
to California until 1931 by John Wayne.) . um Mu ,,,,,,,,,,~

College Leader
Prefers Three
Varied Fields

By TOM BRYANT
and MATTHEW NESVISKY
He works seven days

week.

A‘ He rises at seven in the
morning, eats breakfast and
then begins work at his desk
at home, dictating letters. He
arrives at his office in the Cathe-
dral at around 8:30 a.m. After
checking through the morning
mail, he busies himself with calls

and appointments from 11 a.m. to
12:30 p.m.

Luncheon groups, press or tele-
vision reporters, or other organiza-
tions. He often cats at such places
as the Duqucsne Club, P.A.A. or
the Press Club.

Time Occupied

From two in the afternoon until
‘around seven, meetings and ap-
pointments occupy his time. He
ofteni has discussions with the
Faculty Senate, such committees
of the Trustees as the Financial or
Building, and tries to meet with
the faculty of each department at
least once a year. At the end of
each day he will usually confer
with his immediate secretarial
staff.

He is home and has dinner at
around 7:30 p.m. or‘ 7:45 p.m.
After playing with his children
for a while, he returns to his
desk for another hour or hour
and a. half to ﬁnish paper work,
and then his day is completed.
Chancellor Edward  Litch-
ﬁeld believes in making his life a
“planned program of varied .in-
terests.” He has no real hobbies.
Rather, he divides his time be-
tween government, industry and
education. -

The Chancellor is chairman of
the board of the Government Af-
fairs, director of the Bureau of
Elections Research, and in the
past has been a member of the
Council of Ministers and attend-
ed their conference after the war
in Moscow and London. ‘

Man of Industry

In industry, he is Chairman of
of the Board of Directors of
Smith-Corona—Marchant Corpora-
tion, and is on the boards of Avoc,
Allied Products and Studebaker-
Lark.

In education, Dr. Litchﬁeld’s
4Chancellorship enables him to
speak at various institutions and
organizations, both private and
governmental, on the problems
and future of American methods
of advanced learning.

“These three interests represent
the main workings of our modern
society,” the Chancellor remarked.

3.

‘He added that he derives his en-

joyment in life by changing from
one project to the 1']€X,lr.

His reading is mainly limited to
literature, government, business
and education works, as he tries to
keep abreast of the latest study
and accomplishments in the ﬁelds
in which he is involved. He cannot
read for pleasure as he does not
have‘ the time and his eyes be-
come strained quite quickly. '

Loves Farm

But one of Dr. -Litchf'1eld’s great-
est loves has still not been men-
tioned. This is his farm in Potter
County, in the north-central part
of the state. The thousand acres of

“I’M NOT A ‘TWEEDY’ PERSON,” says Chancellor Litchﬁeld of his

the background” with Ivy League styles. He “always wears a black
tie” with suits, custom made in New York City.

for cultivation, are used for rais-
ing sheep, and the Chancellor is
extremely proud of his 150 new
lambs which have arrived within
the last ten days. ~
The farm is managed by a
family permanently residing on
the_ estate, but the Chancellor
‘tries to take his family there at
least every other weekend. His
children enjoy playing with the
manager’s_ children, whilej“Dad-
dy”. busies himself with mend-
ing fences. ;

Lastly, the Chancellor also en-
joys symphony music, and the is
a trustee of the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony Society. He has a similar
position with the Pittsburgh Play-
house Association.

Detroit Born

This civic leader was born April
12, 1914, in Detroit. He describes
himself as being a “quiet, shy boy
with a comfortable home-life. My
family did not move around much,
and I was not really any different
than any other child.” He was an
only child, and was interested in
farming, engineering and archi-
tecture.

In his junior year at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, where he
majored in Political Science, he

became. interested in public
service.
After completing college in

three years, he ran for State Sen-
ator on the Democratic ticket, but
was not_ successful. _

He was not in military service
during the war, but was engaged
with the State Department for
four and a half years. The Chan-
cellor served on the West German
Reconstruction Committee, handl-
ing all political negotiations for
the US. Military Government. He
was a member of the faculty of
Brown and Cornell Universities,
and later served as Dean of the
Cornell Graduate School of Busi-
ness and Public Administration.‘

Books Published

in 1953, his book “Governing
TPost—War G_ermany" was publish-
ed, and he is now working on a
second volume: “Administrative
Processes of ‘Modern Society.” A

Dr. Litchﬁeld became a per-
manent resident of Pittsburgh

cellor of the University in May,

family on Beechwood Boule-
vard.

His family consists of his wife
and their four children: Teddy,

aged three; Ann Roberta
(“Pudge”), who is in eighth
, grade; Janet, who is patiently

awaiting the results of her col-
lege applications; Peter, a 19-year
old student at the University of
Michigan. .
Chose Alma Mater

His son Peter chose his father’s
Alma Mater rather than the Uni-
versity for obvious reasons. Peter
is presently in Mexico collecting
vampire bats to sell for zoologic-
al research, in order to ﬁnance his

_ second expedition to British Hon-

duras.
Mrs. Litchﬁeld and their
younge child accompany the

Chancellor on his frequent trips
to alumni meetings, away foot-
ball games and business confer-
ences. They travel in their
twi'n—engined Beechcraft, and
average about 100,000 miles per
year.
A The five-year old plane, which
will soon be replaced by a larger
crafe, has a telephone and dicta-
phone, helping the Chancellor to
get much work done in the air.
He estimates that he spent 400
hours in the plane last year, but
no longer does his own piloting.

Father of Four

Farms, Writes,

Travels, Meets

After hectic years of public
service, Dr. Litchﬁeld, when ask-

. ed what personality impressed him

most, replied: “Konrad Ade-nauer,
more than likely. But I am still
indebted for my relationship with
General Eisenhower, Robert Frost,
and Lucius Clay.”
Impression Contrastcd
He also contrasted the impres-
sion he received from Stalin,
whom he described as being opa-
que, to Krushchev, whom he re-
calls joyously riding through
Pittsburgh, waving a cowboy hat.
The subject of politics was
brought up. “Not all will agree
with me, but I think that a
University President should not

have politics.” Although the
C h a nc e l I o r is “notoriously
known as being a Republican,"
he is registered as an Inde-
pentdent. And he describes the
present Administration as being

“extremely vigorous,” and
praised its collection of highly
qualiﬁed individuals.

Dr. Litchﬁeld is also happy with
the direction in which the Uni-
versity is moving. “The Trimester
is a success." he stated, “for three
reasons: It has been established
that a substantial number of stu-
dents apply here because of the
trimester system. Any drop—o{T of
students is due to raised stan.

dards and costs. not to the tri-

mester. .

“What lies ahead? With appli-
cations increasing and the need
for greater expansion, the “Uni-
versity does not intend to stand
still." And, it is surmised, the
Chancellor will not be standing
still, either.

Carter, who missed most of
the practice sessions last week
because of illness, was entered
in only one event.

The Panthers were shut out in

enter anyone at all in the javelin
throw. The javelin situation will
be helped next week, when fresh-
man Oketh Hennington becomes
eligible for varsity competition.

Little Hennon {Makes It’ Big

By ED HOWARD

This writer remembers the
ﬁrst time he saw Don Hennon
play basketball in person. It
was during his junior year,
and the Panthers were in
Beaver Falls, Pa., facing Ge-
neva College.

Hennon’s reputation had pre-
ceded him, of course. He was on
a little man’s All-America -team
and had set a lot of records at Pitt
the year before.

The Geneva fans weren’t very
impressed, however. Expecting a
real live All-American, ‘they saw
instead a little guy about 5'8” tall,
slightly on the pudgy side, and a
team that looked like a collection
of fottball players. _ When young
Hennon began practicing 30-foot
hook shots with both hands in the
pre-game wormup,.the fans took
an immediate dislike to him.

Well, the game started and the
first shot Don took was one of
those Olympian hooks, and it
missed. This the home partisans
loved, and from then on, every
time he got his hands on the ball,
the jeers and riding began.

Hennon kept taking the hooks
and making them, the fans kept
riding him, and the Panthers had
a 20-point lead by halftime. Fun-
ny, the stands seemed sort of quiet
during the second half.

DON HENNON
Holds Scoring Records
$ It I
Maybe Don Hennon never looked
like an All-American, but he cer-
tainly played like one. He set
every record imaginable during
the 1957-58 season, only his sec-
ond in varsity competition. ’A

fantastic high school preformer at

Wampum, Pa., under the tutelage
of his father, Coach L. Butler
Hennon, Don went on that year to
make every “All” team there was.
A proliﬁc scorer, he led his mates
to berths in the NCAA tourna-
ment in both his sophomore and
junior years.

But Hennon, who. is now a sen-

Three Panther pole-valuters tied

“We were running. against

not offering excuses, but there's
no doubt that both Navy and
Maryland have had more oppor-

Douglass Moves Up

~ Netters Beat
‘ Kent State 8-1

For 2-0 Mark

Reversing last year’s «8-1
loss to Kent State, the Pan-

ther racquetmen raised their
record to 2-0. Once again sec-
ond seeded Dave O’Loughlin

was the loser. This time by
the score of 3-6, 6-2, 7-5.

Jack Douglass who started the
season in the number seven posi-
tion, but has since moved up to
number four, played outstanding
tennis in winning 6-0, 6-0. Joe
Brown showed improvement in
defeating Kent State’s first-ranked
Paul Walker 6-3, 6-2.

The Cats number ﬁve man,
Paul Kochmain, played one of
his best matches in three years
by winning 6-2, 6-2. Ralph‘Ma-
son and Roger Glasser, number
three and six for Pitt, displayed
their usual ﬁne form in winning
their matches in straight sets.

Head Coach a Bill Summers
commented after the match, “The
boys showed some improvement‘.
,1 was satisﬁed with their play-
ing, especially the number one
doubles team of Brown ‘ and
Douglass. We have an ample
amount of depth, and the squad
has showed a good competitive
spirit.” '

The scheduled match with Du-
quesne last Friday was reset for
April 27. The next opponent will
be Penn State this Saturday. Both
varsity and freshmen squads will
make the trip.

‘Appreciation for
Last 3 Years a

By TED‘ COLTON
Sports Editor

 

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIlIIIllI|||[]|'

This column is for the purpose of thanking the people
that have helped me while working on The Pitt News the
past three years.

First of all I would like to thank Frank Carver and the

athletic department. It is ‘difficult for a newspaper and the

people they are writing about to remain friendly throughout
a long period of time. When a reporter is young he sometimes
makes mistakes of judgment and facts. I have doneboth
and yet I have received nothing but friendliness from Mr.
Carver.

I next would like to thank Bieano Cook, Pitt’s pub-
licity director. Beano has given me many good “tips”
on stories and has been helpful in supplying informa-
tion ‘for the Pitt News sports pages. This fellow is unique
and probably the best publicity man in the country.

The next man in line is Jack Smith, Executive Sports
Editor. “Wheelin and Dealin’,’ as I call him, has been an

A ‘ irreplaceable help to me the last trimester. Most of the‘,head—
lines on the sports pages are written by Jack and there were

many nights when he would put out the «whole sports page.
, The coaches have made being on The Pitt News enjoy-
able. They were always willing to-help the young reporters.

. .-Even when I wrote those columns about the basketball team,

Coach Bob Timmons never once showed any hostile attitude-

 towards me. He just corrected me on a few of the facts and
A then offered helpful information on next year’s team.

I would like to thank the sports staff — Jim O’Brien,
Bob Smizik, Ed Howard, Art Flggischner, John Fleming
and Barry Epstein for their good work. A recent re-
lease, from Beano’s oﬂice was quoted as saying, “This
‘year’s Pitt News staff has the best for quantity and qual-
V ity in the last nine years on the school-paper.”
I guess at this time I should thank an English teacher.
However, I don’t think it would be wise. I don’t want to put
any one of them on the spot.

My ﬁnal thanks goes to Murry Chass, former editor of

The Pitt News. He taught me everything I know about layout
and has been helpful in many other ways. I

In closing I would like to say goodbye to the graduating,
seniors and hope to be joining you next August if I can get
by those accounting courses.

(Editor’s Note: This will be my last column ingthe
- winter trimester. Since the class that will be graduating
this trimester is the class I entered the University with,
this will be my farewell column although I will be ,writ- I
ing columns during the spring term.)

' Hopes To Follow; Dad To Majors

Suder Sparks Mitmen

By JIM 0’BRIEN 0

Quiet

A Amidst a flock of shabby uniformed baseball players,
most in tattered, soily sweat clothes, Pete Suder, the grizzly

_junior inﬁelder for Pitt’s baseball team, stood out. His con-

spicuousness was caused by the ﬂaming orange jacket which
he wore, and the Cleveland Indian baseball cap which loomed

‘ was his ﬁrst taste of varsity’ com-

prominent among‘ the blue and

gold caps of the others.

Pete Suder does not strive foré
identiﬁcation; his bat speaks
louder than any pompous show
a braggard could ever muster. In
fact, Pete is a-‘quiet, we1l-man-
nered lad,_ whose acknowledg-
ment is derived from a hefty .406
batting average whichhe regus-
tered last season:

His outstanding play in 1960
is especially noteworthy since it

petition. Hehas two more sea-
sons of eligibilityleft, for he had
to sit out his sophomore year be— i
cause of scholastic ditﬁculties. ’
