A female Pittstudent was al-

legedly sexually assaulted early
Sunday morning after accom-
panying a white male, identified
only as ”Rox,” back to his
Dawson Street apartment, ac-
cording to a Campus Police
report.

The report stated that the
18-year-old student and her

friend met her assailant,
described in his late teens,
5-foot-6, 170 pounds with brown
hair, and a friend of his atan Iota
Beta Kappa fraternity party.

All parties then proceeded to
the suspect’s apartment at an
unknown address on Dawson
Street. .

The two then adjourned to the
attacker’s bedroom. The report

stated that at this time the suspect
turned on the victim and, despite
her pleas that she ”did not want
this to happen,” he forced him-
self upon her and committed the
crime.

Following the incident, the vic-
tim fled to her dormitory room
and alerted a resident assistant.
The girl was transported to Ma-
gee Women's Hospital for obser-

Police investigate sexual assault of student

vation. _

At this point, Campus Police
were notified, and an investiga-
tion is presently underway. The
report said that the ”victim would
recognize [the attacker’s]
residence.”

The report stated that Campus
Police are unsure whether the
victim will be pressing criminal
charges.

Sabotage not suspected in British jet crash

KEGWORTH, England (AP) —
Officials said Monday that both
engines on a new Boeing 73 7,ap-

parently failed, causing the plane ~
3 to crash beside Britain's main
‘north-south highway and kill 46

people.

Sabotage was not suspected in
the crash Sunday of the British
Midland Airways jet, the second
major air disaster in Britain in less
than three weeks, said Transport
Minister Paul Channon. But
Prime Minister Margaret Thatch-
er said no possible cause could
be ruled out, including sabotage.

One aviation expert called the
apparent double-engine failure a
10 million-to-1 chance.

Eighty passengers and crew
members — all of the survivors of
the crash — were injured, includ-
ing 43-year-old pilot Kevin Hunt,
who was hailed as a hero for
managing to miss crashing on the
village of Kegworth or the M1
highway.

The jet, en route from London
to Belfast, plowed into a grassy
embankment on the highway
Sunday night as the pilot strug-
gled to make an emergency land-
ing at East Midlands Airport,
about 100 miles north of London.
He missed the runway by about
half a mile.

”So far the evidence, although
by no'means conclusive, is con-

sistent with the right engine hav-
ing stopped before impact, and
there are also signs of fire in the
left engine,” Channon told
BBC-TV.

Asked whether both engines
malfunctioned, he replied: ”That
certainly looks probable at the
moment.”

The Boeing 737-400, delivered
to British Midland just 12 weeks
ago, had flown less than 500
hours, the airline said. Boeing
said the plane hadtwo CFM-56

- engines, built in France by a con-
sortium ofthe U.S.-based Cener--

al Electr_ic Co. and the French
company SNECMA.
SNECMA spokesman Olivier

Fagard said he did not know
whether both engines failed.
’’It is extremely improbable
that both engines would break
down in such a short interval,”
Fagard said in Paris. ”We have
very impressive reliability statis-
tics. There was a fire in engine
No. 1, which was controlled.
There was no fire in the other.”
William Tench, retired head of
Britain's Air Accidents Investiga-
tion Board, said the odds against
both engines failing on a Boeing
737 were about 10 million-to-1.
He suggested there had been a
”technical mistake such as some-
thing incorrect being done to__the

Incidents
of ’da te
rape’
probed

By Lou Grieco
Staff Writer ‘

Acting Campus Police Director
Walt Waters warns students of a
dangerous problem on campus,
a problem in which he states ”all
of the police in the world
couldn't help.”

In the last three weeks, two in-
cidents of what Waters catego-
rizes as ”date rape” have been
reported to the Campus Police.

On Dec. 15, a female Pitt stu-
dent reported being sexually as-
saulted in a Cathedral classroom

by a man she identified as a form-_

er friend. She will not press crimi-
nal charges.

Another female Pitt student was
allegedly sexually assaulted
Saturday night after leaving with
a man she met at an Iota Beta
Kappa fraternity party earlier that
evening. Police are currently
searching for a suspect known as
”Rox."

”[Date rape] is _much more
prevalant than people think,"
said Pitt psychology Professor
Mira K. Moss. ”Figures are hard
to get because people don't
report it as often as stranger
rape."

Moss said statistics show that in
over half of reported rapes, the
victim’ is ”somewhat familiar with
the perpetrator.”

According to Moss, rapists
have three motives: power, anger
and sadism. She added that ”sex-
uality is only a tool to express
these motives.” The date rapist,
like the stranger rapist, usually
acts upon one of these motives,
or a combination of them.

’’It doesn't have anything to do
with how well the rapist knows
the victim,” Moss said.

She added that the anger rapist
is frustrated with his life and takes
it out on his victim. It is not the
fault of the victim.

Walt Waters agrees that date
rape is common. ”Out of the last
four reported rapes and aggravat-
ed assaults, the victim knew the
perpetrator in three cases, and
[in] the fourth one, [the victim]
thought she had seen him be-
fore,” he said.

Waters said that when a
stranger rape occurs, the news
gets out and the police patrols go
on alert. Since date rapes often go
unreported and don't usually
happen in public places, he said

\ COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) —
Samplings of ground water in the
vicinity of two U.S. Department
of Energy plants in Ohio showed
one with limited uranium water
contamination and the other with
none, the state Health Depart-
ment said Monday.

Director Ronald Fletcher said
contamination was limited in the
area around the Fernald uranium
processing plant to three off-site
wells and a cistern. More‘than
300 samples were analyzed.

The Fernald plant, called the
Feed Materials Production
Center, is in southwest Ohio
about 18 miles northwest of Cin-
cinnati.

Seven water samplings around
the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffu-

. sion Plant at Piketon in southern

Ohio" revealed no uranium con-
tamination, Fletcher said.

He said the study, conducted
with the assistance of the federal
agency, also involved 34 soil
samplings around Fernald.

”Only slightly elevated con-
centrations of uranium were de-
tected in soil samples collected
northeast of the center,” Fletch-
er said.

In addition to the soil tests at
the Fernald plant, the survey also
tested 25 homes and 16 other
sites for radon, and 31 other sites
near the plant were checked for

radiation levels.

Reagan budget foils
Casey initiative plan

' WASHINGTON (AP) ~ Presi-
dent Reagan’s $1.15 trillion
budget released Monday would
slash funds for two programs
deemed critical by Gov. Casey:
heating funds for the poor and

-grants for construction of sewage

treatment plants.

Particularly significant for
Pennsylvania, the president's
ninth and final spending plan also
recommends elimination of fed-
eral subsidies for .Amtrak and an
end to a job training program for
workers displaced by foreign
competition.

The Amtrak proposal, like
many others in the spending
plan, has been made by Reagan
before.

”’Round up the usual suspects
— again,” said Richard Bryers,
press secretary to Sen. John
Heinz, R-Pa. ”Essential|y, he has
been trying to do the same things
since 1983, but Congress won't
go any further.”

Stress always a factor

9 for college freshmen

Officials recently released a new survey of college fresh-
men. It had quite a bit to say about stress and the politi-
cal alignment of the subjects polled. That is, that freshmen
are experiencing more stress now than freshmen were
three years ago, that they smoke more and that they tend

conscious.

"*5 to be much more conservatively inclined and money-

Twenty—one percent of freshmen reported feeling over-
whelmed, up 6 percent from 1985. Ten percent said they
smoke frequently. Seventy-two percent said that "making
more money" was an important factor in their decision

to go to college.

None of this is a surprise. Stress has alwaysbeen a fac-

that's got to be watched.”

J tor in college, especially for freshmen. Alexander W.
"' Austin, director of the survey, said that "It's something

The problem of stress in college is not something that
can be "watched" because it is really more a symptom
of a problem than a problem itself. Stress begins with the
heavy competition in high school and pressure from par-
ents and continues after graduation and job—hunting. Life
outside college is stressful, so life inside college isstressful.

v

A more interestinglquestion is whether sophomores,

juniors and seniors are all as "stressed out" as freshmen.
It seems likely that freshmen are more stressed than other
students because they have to adjust to living at college,

Bush's appointments puzzling

I was once again in between
rinse cycles at the Towers’ laun-
dry mat/singles club when my
good friend from East Carnegie,
Chuckie Garbonzovitch, came in
to pay me a post-holiday visit.
Chuckie was still duded up from
Christmas, wearing his red and
green "Mack Truck" cap and a
shirt that read, ’'I’d rather be
drivin’ down Route 88.”

"Hey Chuckie, what's up?" I
asked." ‘ ‘

"Not much, babe,” he an-
swered. ''I do have a couple of
questions for you.”-

"Shoot."' '

''well, for the past couple of
weeks I've been" hearin’ ’bout
George Bush appointing these
dudes to his cabinet and stuf 

"That’s right,” I said.

"Well, what's going on? Is
Charles Schultz still gonna be
secretary .of state and that?"

"George Shultz? No, he's been
replaced...”

"Why?" Chucki.e cut i.n.-

"Wasn't he doin’ a good job and
stuff?"

''I guess so but...” J

"But what  in East Kernegie
we have a sayin’: 'If the pickup
ain't broke, then don't fix it.’
Seems like this Shultz dude is
doin’ the best he can. Accordin’

to the news, he's-got his hands.

meetin’ in Geneva.” -

"Chuckie, you couldn't be
more right. However, it’s the
privilege of the president-elect to
put ‘new faces’ in high positions
in order to challenge the nation."

"Ain’t this the same president-
elect who chose Dan Quayle as
veep?”

"Please! Let's not get into that,”
I pleaded. ‘

"Yins Republicans are drivin’
me nuts, y’know? All right, next
question — if Shultz is getting the
boot then who's replacing him?”

"Jim Baker,” I responded.

''Holy Cow!” exclaimed
Chuckie. "Ain't he that renegade
preacher dude from the PTA
club? I guess that means his wife
Tammy Faye will be secretary of
the interior decorating."

"No, no, not that Jim Bakker.
This is the Jim Baker who was the
treasury secretary under Reagan.”

"Treasury secretary? Under
Reegan? How does that qualify

him as secretary of state?”

"We|l, umm, well, you see...

let's go back to,Dan Quayle.”
"Oh no, you don’t,” Chuckie
huffed. '’I want torknow what ex-
perience Jimmy Baker has to be
secretary of State?” -
"Besides the fact that he's a
Texas buddy of Bush’s?” .
"Yes."
'’I don't know.”
"Oh great. This is actually mak-

ing me long for the time when Al ‘

III

Haig was ‘in charge.

"Well, Chuckie I don't know
what to say. Once again your
down—home sagacity has out-
gunned my National Review-
inspired responses to attacks on
Bush's cabinet selections. But
perhaps I can allay. your fears
with the good news that Jack
Kemp is the secretary of housing
and urban development!"

"Jack Kemp! The quarterback!”

"Chuckie, that was almost 20
years ago. He's Mr. Supp|y—sider
now. He knows his economics."

”Yeah, I can see it now. The
homeless no longer have to find
cardboard boxes to live in — the
Housing Department will rent
them out to them with the option
to buy."

"|t’s a world gone mad,
Chuckie.”

"You know it, babe. Thank
God nothing changes in East
Kernegie." '

The problems ofjim and Tammy not the devil's work

They're baa-aack!

Jim and Tammy Bakker, the
Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos of
TV religion, the Ken and Barbie

of cuteness, the Bonnie and.

Clyde of airwave robbery, are
back on TV.

CAL
THOMAS

It's only seven stations, but they

I started small before.‘

On the premiere show earlier
this week, Bakker refused to ac-
cept any personal responsibility
for his sexual tryst with one-time

- . church secretary Jessica Hahn, or '

for the exorbitant lifestyle he and
his associates at PTL led, or for
any of the other activities that
resulted in a 24-count federal in-

 dictment on fraud charges. I

It was the devil that brought

, him down, he said.

Bakker said that, after he an-
nounced plans two years ago to
build a 30,000-member Crystal
Palace Church at Heritage USA
theme park in South Carolina, "I
believe that was the last straw for
Satan. I think the devil was mad
that something so beautiful was
being built... . I believe the devil
said, 'l_have to smash Jim and
Tammy Bakker.’ " [

I decided to find out whether
that was true, so I called the devil
on his new toll-free hotline num-
ber, I-800—HELL.

''Hello?''

''Is this the devil?”

"Who wants to know?”

"It’s Thomas.”

"Oh, how are things going
with pride and lust and greed in
your life?"

"I struggle against them, as you
know,.but I'm not calling about

me,‘ I'm ,ca|ling‘-about Jim‘ and
.T?".‘!'.‘Y-"'.. . B

»''What about them?” said the
devil, sounding perturbed.

"Jim said on TV that you were
mad at him for trying to build the
Crystal Palace and that's why you
did him in.”

"Are you kidding?” laughed
the devil. "Jim and Tammy were
the things I had going.”

"What do you mean?” I asked.

"That business with Jessica and
the money and the rest was all
my doing, I'll admit, but I didn't
bring down PTL. The Enemy
did.”

"The Enemy?”

"Yeah, you know, G-O-D."

"Why are you spelling God's
name?” I asked.

"Shh-hh," said the devil, get-
ting closer to the phone. ”We
don't say it out ' loud. People
might start believing that He ex-
ists. Once they believe that, they
might start believing that I exist;

then we're really in trouble. You _

see, hell is populated with peo-
ple who didn't believe in me."

"I see.”

"You remember CS. Lewis?”
asked the devil.

"Of course," I replied. '

"A difficult case. He had me
figured out pretty good. He inter-
cepted a‘ letter I wrote to one of

my agents in which I said, 'It is ,

funny how mortals always picture
us as putting things into their
minds: in reality our best work is
done by keeping things out.’ ”
"And that was really what got
to Jim and Tammy?” I asked.
"Of course,” he said. "It's all
founded on pride and material-
ism. You just put G-O-D's name
on it, instead of in it, to make it
look respectable. I've always said
that one of my best weapons is
contented worldliness, and there
was nobody more content with
worldly things than Jim and Tam-

my. Then the Enemy moved in J

and messed things up."

‘'50, Jim wasn't right when he
said you pulled the plug on PTL?”

"Hell, no,” said the devil. "The
Enemy apparently figured those
two had embarrassed Him long
enough!“

"Thanks for the information,”
I said. ,

"Call anytime," said the devil.

After hanging up, I recalled that
a number of the devil's letters had
come into the possession of
Lewis and that I had a copy 0
them in my library. E ' ’

One especially seemed to sum

up the cheap grace and bogus '

theology dished out by the Bak-
kers: "The safest «road to hell is
the gradual one — the gentle

slope, soft underfoot without sud— . I

den turnings, without milestones,

without sign posts.” ,

Providence pounds lackluster Pitt, 92-73

By Ed" Kuznik

Staff Writer

The Pitt women's basketball
team, after coming out on fire to

“open the 1988-89 season, has

25.

Q

fallen on hard times as of late, los-
ing their third straight Big East
game last night to the Providence
Lady Friars, 92-73 at the Fitzger-
ald Field House.

The Lady Panthers fell behind
early, trailing 42-27 at halftime,
and could not even begin to
make up that difference in the se-
cond period.

”We’ve been beating our-
selves,” Pitt head coach Kirk
Bruce said after watching his

team fall to 8-5, 1-3 in the Big
East. Providence improved to
10-3 and 2-2.

”We’re just not doing the little
things that can help us win
games. We had our win streak
(four games) early, and now it’s
simply the fact that in tiny areas
of the game we're not performing
well.”

Bruce's crew got off to a
promising start on the evening,
jumping to a 7-2 start culminat-
ed by a Tabatha Long jumper in
the paint. From there it was all
downhill as Providence method-
ically evened the score and took
advantage of 20 free throw
chances to Pitt's 7 to take the 15

Miller unintimidated

by Smith,

Blaylock,

Barros and Douglas

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

How does Sean Miller spell
relief? -

F-e—b-r-u-a-r-y.

In a period of 17 days, extend-
ing from Jan. 4—21,_Miller, the
sophomore point guard, will
have faced four of the top senior
guards in the nation — Sherman
Douglas of Syracuse; Dana Bar-

.,;§ros of Boston College, twice;

Charles Smith of Georgetown;
and Mookie Blaylock of Ok-

_ lahoma.

His Pitt team, which owns a
7-5 record, 1-1 in the Big East, is
no better off. Syracuse was un-
defeated andranked second by
USA Today before its 81-76 up-
set loss to the Panthers on Jan. 4;
Georgetown has been beaten

. —~.only once and is ranked se_venth;

Oklahoma is also once-beaten
and ranked third. '

Those three teams had a com-
bined record of 36-3 as of Mon-
day night.

But Millersaid there is no rea-
son that he or. his teammates
should be _intimidated by‘ the
rugged schedule.

”At this level, you can't be in-
timidated by anyone. If you are,
you shouldn't be here,” Miller
said. '

But Miller also said that there

’’I don’t know if it’s a great
place for us to be p|aying,”_Paul
Evans said on his post-Boston
College game radio show.

Evans must have been referring
to the Capitol Center — home of
the ever-tough Georgetown
Hoyas, the Pitt basketball team's
next opponent.‘ Yep, you sure are
right, Paul. The Panthers always
have a tough time playing on the
Hoyas’ home court — matter of
fact, they haven't won there since
the 1953-54 campaign, back
when Robert Timmons (174-189
career record) coached the Pan-
ther roundballers into basketball
infamy.

Wait... what do you mean,

-Evans isn't talking -about the

Capitol Center? He certainly

doesn't mean the Carrier Dome;

is no question that he is facing
great talent, perhaps the best in
the country, and that
challenge is there.

”|t’s a good challenge, espe-
cially since I’m a sophomore. I
have nothing to lose and every-
thing to gain." '

Neither Miller, nor three of his
teammates — Darelle Porter, Pat
Cavanaugh and Jason Matthews
— were up to the task of guard-
ing BC’s Barros, who rocked the
Panther defense for a career-high
43 points in the Eagles’ 95-83 _up-
set last Saturday. _

But the idea of guarding Barros
is not to stop him from scoring,
only to ”keep him from having a
great night,” Miller said.

Miller does not anticipate
teams using the same game plan
against the Panthers that BC did
by freeing Barros for outside shots
with picks and screens.

-Georgetown, for example, uses
a pressure defense to check their
opponents.

”Georgetown gets a lot of
points off their defense, and they
have a lot of continuity,” Miller
said. ”Plus, they're an older team
and they have a lot of experience
together.” '

A The Hoyas’ Smith averages

19.9 points and is ninth on Ge-

orgetown’s a|l—time assist list.
Please see Guards, page 8

the guy has no quarter when he
leads his troops into that place.
Pitt smeared the Orangemen
again there just a few days ago.

He's talking about what!! 2

Fitzgerald Field House!!??

Get out of town.

Hey, if team-coach-fan rela-
tions keep up the way they have
been, that's exactly what an ex-
asperated Evans could do — get
out of town, pack it up and go
coach somewhere where he'll be
appreciated.

Evans, who owns a 56-20
record since arriving at Pitt two
years ago (301-130 overall), is up-
set with the hostile atmosphere at
Fitzgerald. ‘'1 don’t know if [play-
ing here] is an advantage for us,”

Evans said. ”Our fans are really.

_ hard on our players instead of

r

the-

point halftime advantage.

The second portion of the
game was more of the same, as
the Lady Friars seemed to be toe-
ing the free throw line all through
the final minutes. When the final
statistics had been accumulated,
thevisitors had racked up a 47-12
advantage in free throws attempt-
ed, making 36 of those.

The fact that his squad had
scored four more field goals than
the opposition on Pitt's own court
and the fact that the Lady Pan-
thers had still been blown out did
not sit well with Bruce.

”You’d have to be a mental
midget not to be upset about get-
ting 12 chances to the other

yelling at the other team.”

Remember Paul, this is Pitts-
burgh, where fans would surely
boo even the good Mother There-
sa if she were a Pittsburgh Steel-
er wideout and would happen to
mishandle a Bubby Brister pass in
the preseason. Just one.

THOMAS
DANYLUK

They've booed the best of ’em

here —— Bradshaw, Parker, Star- ‘

gell, Blyleven, Franco, Marino.
For what ungodly reason would
an amateur squad likethe Pitt
basketball team be immune from
such typically harsh treatment?
Oooh, ignorance maybe. Pan-

teams 4_7 on the foul line,’’ Bruce
said. ’’I don’t know what it is, but
there's something glaring there. I
find it hard to believe that Lorri
Johnson, Amy Holman, and Con-
nie Hurt were not fouled more in-
side tonight.

”But it’s never been a policy of
mine to blame a loss on the
officiating. I told the girls in the
lockerroom -that the problem was‘
we didn't initiate enough contact
ourselves”

As usual, the top scorer for the
Panthers was Johnson, who
tossed in 20 points on the even-
ing. Hurt had a dozen and Jen
Shingler put through ten in gritty
efforts for the squad.

ther basketball fans, the students
mostly, were spoiled by the head-
strong triumvirate of Smith, Lane
and Gore. Those guys wouldn't
let us lose to Boston College and
that shrimpy Dana Barros if they
were here, the ignorant ones rea-
son. ”Losing to lame BC like we
did Saturday night was a joke,
just like our team. The NCAA
Tournament losses to Oklahoma
and Vanderbilt? Yeah, well that
was Evans’ fault.”

But what these ignorant ones
do not see is an extremely young
group of players out there every
night still learning the game. Mar-
tin, Miller, Shorter, xMatthews,
Porter -— all sophom res.

What the ignorant ones do not
see is that the Panthers have vir-
tually no bench to work with," an

.x...

Hurt, in fact, was perhaps the
biggest bright spot for Pitt, dis-
playing strong inside play for one
of the few times this season.

”We want Connie to have
games like this all the time,”
Bruce stated matter-of-factly.”We
want her to be aggressive like that
in practice and in games. She has
not been aggressive in practice
this year, and she sat out a few
games for us because of it.

/‘But we have to get more con-
sistent play from all our starters.

’’If there's one thing, its our
defense and our rebounding that
we need to improve. We can't
give up ninety points like this and
expect to win. ”

' Pitt guard Sean Miller has gone head-to-head with some of the best point guards in the. nation.

Evanshas right to criticize Panther ’fans’d

extremely crucial shortcoming for
a team to have, especially in to-
day's version of the game.
What the ignorant ones do not
see is that the worshipped Smith,
Lane and Gore were, for the most
part, not team players, but only
a talented trio, two of whom used
Pittsburgh as a stepping stone to
the NBA. ‘ ‘
What the ignorant ones do not
see is that in Evans, Pitt has one
of college basketbal|’s brightest
young coaches, a man who is
highly respected among his peers
for his hard work and talent.

Before his arrival at Navy in (

1980, the academy’s record for
most wins in a season was 14;
during ‘Evans’ reign, the school
averaged 20 wins a season.

Another veteran team is Okla-
homa, led by defensive specialist
Blaylock, who recently tied his
own NCAA record of 13 steals in
one game against Loyola-

‘Marymount.

”Mookie Blaylock is going to
play his game no matter what,”
Miller said when asked how he
prepares for a defensive player as
opposed to an offensive player
like Barros.

Blaylock was averaging 21.7

points and 4.7 rebounds and had
60 steals, seven blocks and 89 as-
sists through last Friday.

By John Labriola

Staff Writer
The Pitt Panther Hockey Club

faced off against the Penn State-
McKeesport Saints Hockey Club
Sunday night and skated away
with a 4-2 victory. _

Although the Panthers held the
Saints scoreless throughout the
first period, they were unable to
score a goal themselves. James
Owens Sr., the Panthers’ general
manager, attributed this to the

Panther Hockey C

fact that the team had not had a

chance to practice over the _

Christmas break.

Two minutes into the second
period, Panther left wing Jim
Hendrickson scored the first goal
of the game on an assist from
freshman center Dave Koval.

At 7:27 the Saints recorded a
power—play goal. This was fol-
lowed by a Panther goal scored
by right wing Mark Granatire for

a 2-1 Panther lead.

Granatire scored the Panthers’
third goal a minute and 30 sec-
onds after Owens left the ice fol-
lowing a 10-minute misconduct
penalty.

’’I didn't want to cause any
more penalties so I left,” said
Owens.

With nine minutes left in the
game, Penn State center Joe
Labellarte broke his collar bone

some of the older cheers to get
the crowd fired up, like ‘Let's Go
Pitt’ and ’P—l-T-T.’ We'll be pass-

the Oklahoma game. The cheer-
leaders aren't doing the job, ob-
viously. They are too interested
in doing gymnastic feats.”
McHail said the Golden Pan-

thers are very happy with Evans’
performance at Pitt. ”He gets
plenty of support from us. We're
very happy with what he's done
for us. I think his record speaks
for itself.”

Obviously, a good portion of
the heckling fans who cram into
Fitzgerald Field House don't
seem to hear very well. -
