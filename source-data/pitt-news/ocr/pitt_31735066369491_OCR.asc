Assistant Secretary Cites Need for

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staff Writer ‘

The development of a “community" relationship with
Mexico would have beneﬁts for both the United States and
Mexico, Assistant Secretary of State Viron Vaky said
Saturday night at the Latin American Studies Association
national meeting in the William Penn Hotel.

Vaky told approximately 200 scholars from the United
States and Latin America that the bright economic future of
Mexico would make better ties with the United States’
southern neighbor favorable. Such a relationship would
include the formation of bilateral policies and the eventual
development of an economic community like the Common
Market, he said.

“The evolution in the decades hence of an economic
community, much as there is in Europe and even to include
all of North America, could be possible,” Vaky said.

If United States - Mexico relations do not become closer,
Vaky said the other alternative is to apply general U.S.
policies toward developing countries to Mexico also. He

said the United States, would handle the border with
Mexico to keep the Mexican civilization as unique as
possible without giving the Latin American nation any
special treatment.

Vaky stressed that relations with Mexico is one of the
most important to the United States and is becoming more
important because of recent oil discoveries in Mexico and
the possible growth of trade between the two countries.

“Mexico is emerging as a major economic power.
Discoveries of gas and oil, especially those in the past few
years, have made Mexico a potential major oil producer,”
said Vaky.

The assistant secretary of state cited Mexico’s position
directly to the south of the United States as the other major
factor in United States - Mexico relations.

Increasing crime and smuggling along the border are

I two of the problems both American and Mexican

authorities face, according to Vaky. He said they cannot be
solved by unilateral actions, but are not treated bilaterally

Strong Ties With Mexico

because of traditional fears and hostilities of the two
countries.

Other participants in the discussion cited U.S. policies on
illegal immigrants and U.S. economic interest in Mexico as
major stumbling blocks in better relations between the
United States and its southern neighbor. The discussion
was coordinated by Riordan Roett of The School of
Advanced International Studies at John Hopkins
University.

Olga Tellicer de Brody of El Colegio de Mexico said that
American interest in Mexico since 1976 grew from U.S.
business interests in the Mexican economy. Although
government policies that threatened foreign investments in
Mexico first concerned‘American businesses, Brody said
the discovery of substantial oil deposits changed business’
views of Mexico. ‘

“Mexico is again a land of promise for economic
investors,” she said. “Bankers are friendly to investors

Pitt Political Scientist
Port of Moscow Pact

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer

The University Center For
International Studies and the
Soviet Union Academy of Science
will begin exchanging information
about developments in social
sciences, according to Thomas
McKechnie, senior research asso-
ciate director for the center.

McKechnie was in Moscow
recently to attend a conference
where he signed an agreement to
begin the information exchange.

As per the agreement signed,
the university center will begin
sending “United States Political
Science Documents," a yearly book
that abstracts articles from 150
political and social sciences jour-
nals.

“The purpose of the conference
was to exchange ideas and to note
trends in the development of social
science information and documen-
tation in the two countries through
exchange of information about
technical problems; to discuss
problems about social sciences
management of information, and to
generally get to know what each
side is doing in the way of trying to
deal with the information explosion
in the social sciences,” McKechnie
said.

He explained that an information

of academic journals published in
the U.S. increased.

The amount of academic journals
published became so great that
they “overwhelmed the individual
scholars, students and researchers
and it was sort of a question of how
one knew what was being produced
in their area,” McKechnie said.

Social science professionals——
particularly those involved with
political science—began to realize
that a system had to be developed
to manage the ﬂow of information
and research results produced by
academicians, he said.

“We had to develop some kind of
information system that identifies,
each year, the various articles
being produced and perhaps gives
some kind of abstract or synopsis of
them and identifies areas that
they’re dealing with and their
major themes,” McKechnie stated.

The Soviets had a similar
problem with an information
explosion, only with a different
twist.

“Researchers in different parts
of this very vast country, a huge
country with about 85 languages,
were doing research but they were

-cut off from similar research being

done in another section of the
Soviet Union,” McKechnie said.
“They saw the development of
an information system asa way in

‘Community’ Relationship Urged Between U.S. and Mexico

(Continued from page I) A
and there is the possibility for expansion of American
goods in the Mexican market.”

Working against a better climate for American
investment in Mexico is the beginning of a national
development project that would include little dependence
on the United States, according to Brody. She said this
‘plan includes trade agreements with France, Japan and
Spain, and plans that would allow Mexico to consume
internally most of the gas it produces.

“This development project is not expressed clearly but
nevertheless there is a climate for it that has been
developing for the last few years,” Brody said. _

Along with the development of economic policies to end
past Mexican dependence on the United States, Brody said
a rebirth of nationalism is occuring since the United States
showed evident interest in Mexican oil deposits.

“The great interests of Americans in oil has given birth
to a defensive nationalistic attitude best shown by a
Mexican author’s article in The Washington Post titled,
“Mexico’s Not An Oil Well, Yankee!’ ”

In comments on a question from the audience, Brody
said the United States must admit to the historic
differences and difﬁculties between the two countries and
realize that it is impossible to ‘develop an economic
community between the two countries because of these
problems. I

“The United States must recognize that we are two

countries forming different positions and it is impossible to
integrate their two economies to benefit both countries,”
she said.

Jorge Bustamente of El Colegio de Mexico said
misunderstanding of the problem of “undocumented
immigrants” from Mexico could hurt relations between the
United States and Mexico. He said the traditional but false
view of illegal immigrants as harmful to the American
economy could create tensions between the two countries.

Bustamente cited the payment of sales taxes, social
security and income tax by illegal immigrants as one of the
many benefits from these immigrants. He said these
immigrants would help underwrite social security
payments when the population of the “baby bdom” era
reaches retirement age. ‘

“This is just one example of benefits that could result
from this phenomena of undocumented immigration...,”
said Bustamente, “a phenomena that has been deﬁned as
negative, that has been defined as a silent invasion, that
has been defined as a threat and that has been defined as
an internal problem.”

Professor Wayne Cornelius of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, the ﬁnal participant in the
roundtable on Mexican relations, criticized members of the
Carter administration for their hope that Mexican oil
money can solve the problem of illegal immigration and for
their view of the end of illegal immigration as a solution to
U.S. labor problems. 2

“Mexican immigrants are a convenient scapegoat for
Americans to beat up on for inflation and runaway taxes,”
said Cornelius. “The Carter administration has
encouraged this idea. Secretary of Labor Marshall has said
repeatedly that a crackdown on immigrants is the way to
solve our labor problems.”

Cornelius echoed Bustamente’s argument that illegal
immigrants benefited the United States and Mexico. He
pointed out that many young Americans are no longer
willing to perform the jobs that Mexican immigrants do and
said the United States needs these workers wiling to do
unskilled labor.

“The number of low skill jobs is not expected to decline
but to increase—-especially in the urban service
industries——so the demand for Mexican labor will not
decrease but will probably increase,” Cornelius said.

The MIT professor said the belief held by some Carter

administration officials that Mexican “petrol pesos” can V A I

be used to create employment for the Mexicans who now
migrate to the United States is not realistic.

“There is no way Mexico can absorb the backlog of nine
million unemployed and underemployed estimated to be in
Mexico unless Mexico shifts to a much more intensive
expansion of the Mexican economy,” said Cornelius. “If
the inﬂux of petrol pesos is as inﬂationary as many
economists predict, the pressures for immigration could be
even greater.”

Popko: Engineers Will Become More Involved With SGB

By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer

Bernie Popko, newly elected
president of the Engineering
Student Cabinet said the organiza-
tion will increase its _involvement
with Student Government Board.

The objective is one of several
Popko said the Cabinet will pursue
during his term in office, which
began this week.

Popko, who served during the
past year as a member of SGB, said
his experience there would help

him in his leadership position on
the engineer’s cabinet.

“I can use my experience for the
beneﬁt of engineers. Another
thing is I can't be snowed when I go
down to the Student Government
Board office because I know how it
operates," Popko said.

The cabinet will also attempt to
extend the period for withdrawals
from engineering classes, he
continued.

Supply Company
Removes Typewriters

By THERESA SULLIVAN

Coin-operated typewriters in
Hillman Library have been re-
moved due to excessive vandalism.

“We regretted taking the type-
writers out, but we feel that due to
circumstances beyond our control,
we had no other alternative," said
Robert Neumann, assistant to the
director of administration and fiscal
control at Hillman.

An examination of the typing
room, located on the second floor of
the library, revealed broken chairs,
cigarette burns, grafﬁti and ink-
stained carpets.

The typewriters were provided
by Philip S. Weiner Ofﬁce Supplies
when the library opened in 1968.

“We feel that Mr. Weiner did
his level best to keep the
typewriters maintained and opera-
able. but because of the continued
abuse. he had no other choice."
Neumann said. I

“We are not sure who the
culprits were, and because the
library is available for public use, I
do not wish to place the blame on
students,” he said.

The typing room will still be
available‘ for use, provided stu-

dents bring their own typewriters,’

Neumann continued. The room has
wall electric sockets for those with
electric typewriters.

For anyone needing a typewriter,
the machines can be rented from
the Pitt'Bookstore.

until, say, six weeks in(to the
term).” Popko said.

An extended withdrawal period
would enable engineering students
to determine whether or not they
should continue enrollment in the
course, he said.

Another issue the cabinet will
address is a new university
mandate requiring students enrol-
ling for more than 18 credits a term
to pay a per-credit rate for any total
over 18.

Several engineers, Popko stated,
are required to take 19 credit
terms, which “forces them to pay

V extra."

The junior engineer also said the
proposed allocation for the cabinet
for 1979-80, approximately $5,000,
will be sufficient for operation next
year.

“It’s acceptable if we receive a
subsidy for the Shamrock Ball. We
don’t think it’s an exorbitant
amount considering we _represent
one-sixth of the student body. We
could use twice that amount,” he
stated.

The allocation is currently
tied-up in SGB due to dissent over
a cut in the Black Action Society
budget--a SGB governance group,
as IS the engineer’s cabinet--and
budgets that include funding for
organization formals like the
engineer’s Shamrock Ball.

Popko also said the group will
attempt to mobilize engineers to
vote in next year’s SGB elections to
make student government more
“committed to the interests of
engineers.”

Nuclear Commission Must Re-establishCredibi|ity

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON —— The Nuclear
Regulatory Commission faces what
may be an even greater challenge
than the near-disaster at Three
Mile Island-—a ﬁght for credibility
and public confidence.

Critics and supporters alike say
the 5-year-old agency is ‘ going
through the most crucial time in its
history, with investigations into the
accident at the nuclear plant in
Pennsylvania expected to put the
NRC on trial.

“Congress is going to ask, ‘Can
we depend on these people?’ ” said
a prominent nuclear physicist, who
is a supporter of the NRC and a key
member of its advisory committee
on reactor safety.

“It’s a crucial time for them,” he
added, asking not to be identiﬁed.
All ﬁve commission members are
to appear this week at a
congressional hearing into the
accident.

President Carter’s special com-
mission on the Three Mile Island
accident also will focus on NRS
performance as it examines “the
nature and adequacy of the
response...by all levels of govern-
ment,” according to a White House
document. -\ '

Established in 1975, the NRC is
charged with licensing nuclear
plants, regulating operation and
acting when violations occur. Its
predecessor, the Atomic Energy
Commission, had an ofﬁcial role of

promoting nuclear power; the NRC
does not.

But the agency’s critics claim the
NRC has maintained, as one said,
“a mystifying, obstinate enthus-
iasm” for nuclear power at the
expense of protecting the public.
Many key staffers, as well as
Chairman Joseph Hendrie are
former AEC ofﬁcials and strong
advocates of atomic power, these
critics argue.

And although the agency’s
performance at Three Mile Island
has been praised, it also was
marked by early confusion and
conflicting statements. Further-
more, the causes for the accident—
a broad range of human, mechani-
cal and design ﬂaws—opened

questions about the NRC’s moni-
toring procedures.

Henry Kendall, a professor of
physics at the Massachusetts
Institute of -Technology, said the
agency over the years has fought
an attempt to lower radiation
standards. lobbied against lifting
the ceiling on insurance coverage
in a nuclear accident. and
“misrepresented the public on the
hazards of nuclear power plants.”

NRC spokesman Frank Ingram
strongly denies any of the
commissioners or key staff mem-
bers compromise their roles as
regulators to promptte nuclear
power. None of the commissioners
or any key staff member was
available for interviews.

Ingram said they are “too busy”
dealing with the Three Mile Island
situation and preparing for hear-
ings.

Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz., who
will conduct some of the hearings
and who has criticized the agency,
says he believes a number of recent
decisions may indicate a tougher
NRC attitude toward the nuclear
industry.

Udall’s aides cite the NRC
closing last month of ﬁve nuclear
plants in the East to check for the
potential for earthquake damage
and its earlier rejection of the
so-called Rasmussen Report, which
for years had been a guide t0
nuclear power plant safety.

‘ American
Busybody
  in Iran

Kate Millett, feminist ‘activist and author, has

found a new task for herself since her ejection from
Iran last month, where she was helping to organize
the women’s movement to oppose the conservative
policies of the Ayatollah Rhuollah Khomeini. Millet
now _speaks throughout the United States, urging her
audiences to ensure that the freedoms won by Iranian
women in the past are not lost under Khomeini’s
Moslem republic. _
A “I have a great fear for my sisters there (in Iran). I
have great fear for that the -movement there will be
crushed. I appeal to you not only as feminists but as
humanists...to ensure that the revolution is saved...
that Iranian women will not be squashed,” Millett
told a dissentious crowd in Benedum Hall Wed-
nesday night.

Some of the listeners at the forum sponsored by

Letters

the Pitt campus National Organization for Women
were not impressed with the author’s concern for the
plight of Iranian women. Some Iranians in the
crowd rose at several points and called Millet “crazy,
a Central Intelligence agent.” One woman who
spoke during a question and answer period after

speech was also unsympathetic to the activi_st’s pleas. .

She commented: “I am an Iranian woman. We don’t
need your help.”

The question'Millet’s Iranian critics raise is clear.
Do outsiders have the right to interfere with another
people’s culture and attempt to impose their moral
values on the foreign society?

If we -take the comment of- the Iranian woman at
Millet’s speech to be representative .of Iranian
women, the answer to the question is a resounding,
“No!” The Iranian people have just escaped the rule
of the Shah, who many viewed as a puppet ‘of the
U.S. government, and Iranians now appear to want
to solve their problems withoutthe interference of
any outsiders, including Kate Millett. Despite that
Millett was invited to Iran by the Committee for Ar—
tistic and Intellectual Freedom in Iran, the question
of interference raisedby the Iranian women is still
valid.

We must agree‘ with the Iranians who object to
Millett’s obstreperous protests while in Iran as
foreign interference. The Iranian people have an
unique culture and they have the right to decide what

course their society will take in the future. "We must ‘

allow them to decide their future for themselves
without American busybodies helping to lead
protests through the streets of Tehran.

As supporters of equal rights for women, we
would be as disappointed as Millett if the Iranian

people should decide to re-enact the ancient Moslem
rules requiring the wearing of the traditional Moslem
gown, the shadors, but it is their right to make that
final decision without the interference of people like
Millett.

It appears enough sentiment for and against the
Moslem dress codes exists to ensure that the question
is debated fully. The act of the Iranian men who
Millett said protected protesting Iranian women is
one example of the breadth of opinion on the
question. .

Perhaps the best way Millett could convince others
of the importance of, equality for women is to set an
example for them in_the United States by working
full time to defeat the sexism that is still rampant in
this country. This surely would be preferred to her at-
tempts to play savior of Iranian women in the streets

- of Tehran.

Editorial on Three Mile Island No Laughing Matter -

After the broadside delivered by
Messrs. Hahn, Kuhn, Hershey and
Thompson, I'm surprised The Pitt
News wasn’t blasted clean out of

the water. About the only thing
they didn’t question was the
editors’ legitimate birth. Of

course, The Pitt News should have
made mention of the worthwhile
Hand in Hand Festival. Yet I was
wondering if the organizers of the
festival bothered to inform The Pitt

News beforehand. Good publicity
is no accident.

If no reporter were available to
cover the event they could have
written a story themselves. At any
rate, in their lengthy letter they
certainly should have told us
readers more about the festival. I
have no idea what happened there.

I reread the editorial of April 2 on
nuclear power and tried earnestly
to find what they thought was so

funny. I didn’t find anything funny
or asinine. As a long-time resident

of the Harrisburg area the accident

at Three Mile Island deeply
disturbed me; My home town
came very close to becoming a
ghost town. 

I spent many summers boating.
and ﬁshing on the Susquehanna
River around Three Mile Island. I
won’t be going back. It’s beautiful
there-I can’t recall any reporter

mentioning that fact. For ten years
I watched them build the concrete
cooling towers on Three Mile
Island. They cast long shadows.

On a clear day one can see them

from Peters mountain, twenty
miles to the north.
Messrs. Hahn et al. sadly

underestimate the impact of this
incident on the citizens of the
Harrisburg area. I think the
citizens would have a thing or two

to say about the future of nuclear
power in their area and their
shattered faith in the gospel of
nuclear engineering according to
Babcock and Wilcox. Most
remained, it is true, but I assure
you they weren’t laughing at the
news bulletins and commentary.
It’s not over yet. '

Need for News Coverage Guidelines at Newspaper

Ithink it is high time for The Pitt
News staff and advisors to sit down
and seriously discuss the quality
and professionalism of our main
campus newspaper. This is evi-
dently a necessity as it has thus far
proved fruitless to point out the
numerous journalistic discre-
pancies and atrocities that have
been committed within the past
several weeks and during the entire
school year. I feel that a little
self-evaluation would be most
helpful in order to try and clear up
many of the deficiencies and
difficulties that arise inherently
with the production of a major
campus medium of communication.

I am certainly aware that no
major changes can be made within
the next several weeks, but surely
by the end of the summer a feasible
list of criteria for choosing news
articles and features, should be
compiled and utilized in order to
ensure the Pitt population of a
consistently good campus news-
paper.

Before continuing, it is worth
pointing out that, in the previous
paragraph, when reference was
made to The Pitt News, it was
made clear that I am writing about
a campus newspaper. I ‘am not
interested in the relative quality of
The Pitt News with regard to The
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette or the
Pittsburgh Press, for they are

entirely different (or should be, at
least) in terms of content.

This concept should be examined
in more detail. The function of the
major newspapers of Pittsburgh is
to provide international, national
and local news to the extremely
large and diverse population of
most of western Pennsylvania. It is
entirely redundant and unneces-
sary for The Pitt News to do the

. same. "First of all, it is well known

that The Pitt News is short on
space.

This has always been the excuse
given when a major university
program had been given the shaft
(that is, lack of coverage) in favor of
other, supposedly more important
space-fillers. Secondly, The Pitt
News, like every other group on
campus, is short on funds.
Otherwise, surely, they would
expand the size of the paper.
Lastly, and perhaps most obvious-
ly, The Pitt News lacks the
know-how, man-power, and pro-
fessionalism to cover the broad
variety of news events which are
typically found in major newspap-
ers. .

Fine, now that it has been
ascertained that The Pitt News is a
campus paper, perhaps now I can
hope to deﬁne the Pitt population
and its needs and desires with
respect to a campus paper. As I
seevit, the University of Pittsburgh

is a non-isolated entity consisting
of extremely diverse groups of
students, faculty, staff, and admin-
istrators. Here, the ‘word non-iso-
lated plays an important part of the
definition.

The people who comprise the Pitt
population are not isolated from the
outside, world. They have
television, radio, telephones, and
large-scale newspapers and maga-
zines at their fingertips. They have
little need of an advertisement-
overridden synopsis of the world’s
events; that they can obtain
elsewhere.

What I feel the Pitt community
needs in terms of a written
communication medium is a source
of information about Pitt. A good
campus newspaper should inevit-
ably be able to answer the
following questions: What is going
on in the university today? What
programs can I go and see over my
lunch break or after dinner? How
did The Pitt News critic like the
program I saw a couple of days
ago? What was the program like
that I had to miss because I had to
study for an examination? Is there
anything coming up in the near
future ‘that, as a Pitt student, I
should know about?

As it stands now, The Pitt News
is not answering these questions-
at least not to the extent to which
they should be answered. This is

 

the most serious flaw which can be
encountered by a campus news-
paper.

Finally, and I feel it should be
said, a lot of the problem probably
rests with the fact that The Pitt
News is understaffed. This is also
what I have been told by the
present staff. Perhaps few people

‘want to become involved with an

organization that is campus-re-
nowned for its poor quality. The
reason is simple—why risk ridicule
day in and day out by working on
the newspaper?

True, this may be far-fetched,
but in any case the typical opinion
of the university public toward The

Pitt News must be drastically
improved. How this may be
brought about is up to those who
work on the newspaper, but it is
certainly a matter worthy of utmost
consideration.

Perhaps next year and in the
years to come, the members of the
Pitt community will take pride in
their newspaper and The Pitt News
will reciprocate and take pride in
the University of Pittsburgh.

Pitt Ultimate Frisbee Team Hosts National Competition

By JOE BRANDT

Although hampered by high
winds and unusually cold weather,
Pitt’s “ultimate Frisbee” team got
a taste of what national competition
is like, and received some much
needed experience, as it played
host to five other teams at Tree’s
Field this past weekend.

For those not familiar with the
sport, ultimate frisbee was spawn-
ed during the frisbee boom of the
sixties. Teams of seven men work
a frisbee down a 60-yard ﬁeld,
scoring when the disc is caught
past the opponent’s goal line.

The sport is relatively new here,
with Pitt ﬁelding a team for the

ﬁrst time this year. Until now, the
team has played mostly against
local competition, mainly C-MU.
But the two Oakland schools got
together, and invited schools from
all over to come participate in last
weekend’s tournament.

Pitt and C-MU may have gotten a
little more than they had bargained
for, as teams from Indiana, Ohio,
New Jersey, as well as Pennsyl-
vania, showed up to treat each
other to some ﬁrst-class competi-
tion.

Represented were Pitt, C’-MU,
Penn State, the Morris County
(New Jersey) “Space Gorillas,”
Earlham (Indiana), and Kent State
(Ohio). And after Saturday and
Sunday's games were over, it was
little Morris County that stood out
above the others.

The tournament went over well,
thanks to some hard work by its
main organizer, Andy Cumis, and
with a little help from the general
carefree attitude shared by each
team.

The meet came in handy for
Pitt’s young team, teaching them a

few new skills, and polishing off
some old ones.

“Earlham threw a zone at us that
we had never faced before,” said
Matt Wolfe, a member of the
squad. ,“We might even use it
ourselves some day.”

“This match was good for us to
get some experience in against
good teams,” said Matt Miao,
another member of the Pitt
Fastbacks. as they call themselves.

The Fastbacks will need all the
help they can get right now.

because they will be competing at
the Mid-Atlantic Conference Tour-

nament in West Virginia at the end -

of this month.

But who knows? With a little bit
of luck, Pitt may be able to boast
about having the ultimate in
ultimate. That may seen a long
way off. but with interest in the
sport catching on (the team will be
featured on “Evening Magazine"
in the near future) the 30 or so
members of the Pitt team just
might sail as far as their ﬂying
discs will take them.

Harrisburgh Residents
Attend Special Mass

By The Associated Press

On a chilly, blue-gray morning
that seemed more winter dismal
than springlike, the faithful at the
Seven Sorrows of Our Lady
Catholic Church gathered for Palm
Sunday Mass.

They came to commemorate the
beginning of the last week in the
earthly life of Jesus Christ and
received the blessed palm that
signifies Easter is but seven days
away.

And by their presence, they gave
testimony to their faith that life can
and will go on in this small borough
within the shadow of the crippled
Three Mile Island nuclear plant.

Several families brought their
small children, although Gov.
Richard Thornburgh had advised
that pre-schoolers and pregnant
women stay out of the area.

“I’m glad it’s pretty much
over,” said a young father while
his wife and ‘another relative held
their twins. '

Another father, with three young
children, was angry with the press,
a force he feels is out to destroy his
home even more than the invisible
radiation that has seeped from the
nearby plant.

“I don’t want to spread the
stories that are a detriment to our
surroundings.” he said, annoyed at
being asked for his thoughts on the
present and future of his home-
town.

After Mass, Father Tim Mulvey
arranged palm fronds on the table
for distribution and greeted his
parishioners.

“It seems to be coming back to
normal,” he said. noting that the
church was full compared to some
of the empty pews that greeted him
the week before.

Despite over a week of frighten-
ing reports from the nearby plant,
Mulvey said he wasn’t anxious.

“I am past 65, I figure this type
of disaster at least guarantees me
another 20 years. I wasn’t worried
about radiation taking that big a
hold,” he said. 1

Outside in the parking lot, one
man talked with a friend about
going to an anti-nuclear demon-
stration planned for the State
Capitol later in the day.

“I feel the plant should be closed
down,” said the man, who
identiﬁed himself only as the sole
Stefursky in Middletown.

He said he also felt that a 10-mile
area around the plant should be
permanently cleared and home-
owners properly compensated. But
he said he doubted if the
government would ever buy that
idea.

For now, people will just go on
living, trying to forget the plant
and what might have been.

During the Mass, the congrega-
tion sang hymns noting the hope
represented by the coming Easter.

Hi there. We are The Magic
Bus, the Commuter Newsletter.

Inside you’ll find stories
aimed at helping the commuting
student at Pitt.

This issue has a distinctive
editorial taste to it. It won ’t
always be like this. The reason

for this is this issue went to press

in kind of a hurry, because we
wanted to get it done while there
were still commuters here to
read the damned thing.

But seriously folks, we are
serious about and committed to
this paper. Help us out. We
welcome letters, stories, etc.
Please address these to The
Magic Bus—Commuter Affairs
Committee, c/o Student Gover-
ment, 305 Schenley Hall, Pitts-
burgh, Pa. 15260.

The next issue will be June 23,
for Freshmen Orientation. After
that, September, tentatively
once a month.

Any questions, talk to us or
Bernadette Herward and Anita
Meehan, CACco-chairmen.

Thanx, and wish us luck.

Since this newsletter is called the Magic
Bus, it was deemed appropriate that there
should be a picture of a bus on the front page.
The bus seen above is hardly magic, and in
fact is anything but—thusly it is under
criticism by the Commuter Affairs Committee
(CAC). The committee would like to see more
busses running on more diversified routes.

For example, a shuttle bus to run only from
the Cathedral to Trees Hall, and special north
and south routes to enable commuters driving
to park further away, would be desirable. If
you would like to see improvments like these
made, make your voice heard through the
CAC, in room 305, Schenley Hall.

And Now, A Sales Pitch

By Ron Shaw

As another school year
comes to an end, the Commuter
Affairs Committee appears to be
in the best shape ever. We
solved the U-ticket problem,
started the commuter bandit
program and have an orientation
program set up to help the in-
coming freshmen have a bet-
ter start than we did.

But we will need more mem-
bers before we can really take
off and achieve some of our
goals. We barely had enough
people to write this commuter

newsletter and there aren’t
enough members to keep the
Commuter Bandit out everyday.
We also will not be able to start
other programs next fall without
more people.

Other colleges and univer-
sities have free student parking.
Does Pitt? Pitt doesn't offer
overnight facilities to commuters
either. And our Student Union is
definitely not the ideal place for
commuters to meet. Yet over
60% of the students going to
Pitt commute. We are the
majority. There lsno reason why
we can't get what we want or to

change some things to benefit
commuters.

But first, we need you. We’ll
only get change through active
support. If something gets you
steamed every day, like hunting
a parking place, do something!
Join us and try to correct the
problem. You can choose one
of four subcommitties; Parking
and Driving, Mass Transit,
Programming, or Services and
Facilities, wherever you think
there is a great need for change,
and work on that problem. Since
we are the majority, we'll be able
to change almost anything.

We have fun at our meetings
just by telling fellow commuters
the troubles and incidents of
commuting to Pitt everyday. We
are also proud of building our
first place winning float for
homecomming '78 and we in-
tend to take first place again
next year. We also play some in-
tramural sports, so it's not all
work.

So if you're interested in what
we're doing and want to help
solve some of the problems, join
us and share your ideas. Keep

By Way Of  

Infroclucfion

The University of Pittsburgh considers all its

students that do not live in the dorms as commuters.

That takes in a pretty large number.

In fact sixty percent. That amounts to about
8,000 people, all commuters. Now, those who do
not drive or ride to school because they live only
several minutes walking distance can be somewha
discounted, although not left out.  

It's those who drive to school or take a bus we
wish to address. i

We are going to try to make life easier for you.
In the future we hope to havebetter buses that will be
on time, staffed by bus drivers that have a personality
above that of a subhuman.

we hope to eliminate (or, to be realistic,
lessen) the strain to riders as described in John Lenkos

Also, we hope to have more bus shelters.

For drivers: we hope to soon have priority
parking, where those who drive the farthest distance
will be guaranteed parking, all based on a scale of
distance. For example, someone from Monroeville
would receive a higher priority than someone from
McKee’s Rocks, who would receive a higher priority
than someone from Squirrel Hill, and so on. A

We hope to have a place where all commuters
can go and relax, because unlike residents. there are
no dorm rooms where commuters can go to study ,
sleep or whatever. ‘

These are just dreams, true. But if all the com-
muters work together, they just could becomereality.

The purpose of this newsletter is to inform the  

commuters, to give them a voice, to cater to their
needs. We will have stories on bus detours and service
in general; as well as complaints concerning these. We
will have updates on parking and driving in general. We
will publish letters from irate commuters.

We will represent the commuting section of the

  student body.

Commuters, this is your paper! What happens
now is up to you.

Behers Tells of Commuting Experiences

By Diane Behers

By now, everyone is familiar
with the old conflict of Com-
muters vs. Dorm Residents.
We've heard the pros and cons
of both sides time and time
again. Those of us who have
choosen to commute, for
whatever reason, have been
faced with another decision-how
to commute.

The two primary means of
transportation to and from cam-
pus are riding Port Authority
Transit buses and driving a car.
From my experiences with both

of these forms, I've realized that I

they each have their good
points as well as their bad
points.

For my first two years at Pitt I
relied on buses. I'd have to say
that the chief disadvantage of
taking PAT is the time involved
in travel. A typical bus ride to
Oakland from my home in the
South Hills, amere seven miles
away, averaged one hour. Now
this included a half mile walk to
the bus stop—uphill, a leisurely
ride through the Liberty Tun-
nels, and transferring to an
Oakland bus downtown—this
was the most fun of all. After
staring at the empty bus lane on
Fifth Avenue for 15 minutes, all
the buses would inevitably arrive

at the same time. I then hadto ‘

-decidezif a 61 -A, B, or C would
get me there faster than a 71,
73, 75, or 76. I usually took the
one that had the most standing
room—empty‘ seats were
nonexistent.

Another problem with buses
was relability. Nothing made me
madder than waiting 45 minutes
in the freezing cold for a bus that
never showed up because the
driver called in sick.

There are a few advantages
to riding the bus. It's much
cheaper that owning and
keeping up a‘car and I didn’t
have to worry about getting to
school by 8:00 for my 10:00
class just so I could get a
parking space. I didn’t realize
these advantages until after I
decided to get a car.

Driving to school out travel
time just about in half. I still had
to contend with the Liberty Tun-
nels, but the walk and passage
through downtown were
eliminated. Another good thing
about driving was that I could
decide just when I wanted to
come and go rather than follow
some busschedule.

But the cost of a car is
tremendous, as I quickly found
out. Costly not only in insur-
ance, inspections, repairs, and
gas, but in parking tickets as
well. When I was lucky
enough to get a parking space

near campus, I was often
unlucky enough to forget to

~ feed the meter.

I had some other bad ex-
periences with driving and
parking, such as the time my car
was stuck in -a mound of snow in

Schenley Plaza and had to be.

towed out, or the time I realized
my battery was dead and I didn’t
have jumper cables. g

At the end of three years, I'd
had enough of all these
problems and decided to try
what seemed to be the only
other alternative—walking. Well,

to do that, I moved into an off?

campus apartment. It's so much
more convenient to wake up
less than an hour before my first
class and make it there on time.
It's great not to have to worry
about fighting traffic everyday.
But believe me, -I pay for
these conveniences—pay
literally through rent, electric

and phone bills, grocery bills.

A I've also learned that many of
the things I took for granted
while living at home are luxuries
out here in Oakland—color TV,
clean clothes every week and
especially food on the table
everyday.

So there is no clear answer
on what to do. My. advice to
other students is just to do what
works for them. Hopefully it
won't always be like this.

Government Board for a year,

mittee chairperson. While on the

Problem: More Bus Shelters  

By Mark Salve

Take a ‘look during any rainy
day on the corner of Fifth

avenue and Bigelow boulevard A

and count the number of
soaking wet commuters. Each
of these wretches can look for-
ward to colds, flu, and at the
very best pneumonia. Why
should 60% of the student
body, not to mlentionthe
riders, suffer’? it  seems that

  when someone in Pittsburgh w
- had

the bright idea of

establishing Forbes and Fifth as
one-way thoroughfares they
forgot to include bus shelters in
their plans. True, there are new
bus shelters at the newer stops.
However, these can ac-
comodate upwards of seven
people in what can best be
described as scant comfort. The
roomy bus shelters that still
stand along the Student Union
‘property have become nothing
more that posterboards.
Admittedly, the university
might not own the land along

several of the bus stops that
critically need more bus
shelters. Yet how can the single
largest employer in Allegheny
County fail to have some clout at
City Hall? So far the university

  Return of the Commuter Bandit  

A By Peter Karlovich

Who has a book of tickets, a
bag of change and hates
metermaids? Why it's the Com-
muter Bandit, of course!

The Commuter Bandit is the
brainchild of the Commuter

Affairs Committee and is .

charged with allowing no meter
to expire in the Pitt campus
area.

“The Bandit really got its start
this year,”committee co-
chairperson Bernadette Her-
ward said. “lt’s really gone over
bi 

gstudents can usually see the
Bandit running in front of meter-
maids trying to get to the meters
before they do.

‘They (the metermaids) don’t
really mind,” said Wayne Cass,

business manager of the com-5

mittee, “but it leaves them with 3

Whenever a member of the
committee wants to be the
Commuter Bandit, he picks up a
roll of nickles and a handful of
“tickets” that explain the pur-

Dose of the project and ask for a
small donation in return for the
service.

“This year we've saved about
500 people from getting tickets.
That adds up to about $1500
worth of three dollar tickets,”

It looks like the Commuter Bandit was too late to save this
poor soul. But, never fear, the Bandit will get his revenge. If
you want to help prevent parking tickets, stop up to the

Commuter Affairs Committee, room 305, Schenley Hall, and
you too can help make metermaids as obsolete as the 5 cent

parking meter.

committee co-chairperson Anita
Meehan said. “The total cost

1 has been about $50."

“We-’ve allocated more
money for next year,” Cass
said, “But we need more people
available to distribute it."

Despite increased
allocations, the Commuter
Affairs Committee has the
smallest budget on campus,
while representing the majority
of students. The committee
members feel that this is not fair,
but until recently -have not
been organized to the-fullest ex-
tent.

If the Commuter Bandit goes
as well next year with the in-
creased allocations as it did this
year, hopefully this will give the
committee inpetus to go on to
bigger and more involved
projects designed to benefit the
commuting student, and in turn,
benifit the entire student body.

The 61C—McKeeSpOrt Dilemma...

By John Lenku

A new genre of bus rider has
appeared in the McKeesport
area. Their blatant arrogance
and putrid decorum have left the
commuting student with a
dilemma; whether to relinquish
his seat in the name of courtesy
to one who is riding a very short
distance, or to stand his ground
and face a barbarous verbal
assault for the duration of that

What we're talking about is
the multitude of senior citizens
who ride the inbound 61-C/Mc-
Keesport bus route for ap-

crowded buses, unnerved
drivers, and a group of com-

service. In 1964, under
president Lyndon. Johnson,
Allegheny County received
federal funding to improve the

transportation system (PAT).-

Therefore it was able to provide
added services by implementing
the U-bus routes to Oakland. If
these‘ federal funds cease, then
PAT will be forced to discon-
tinue many of its U-bus routes.
According to a U-busdriver,
these funds may cease to come
to PAT. When they do, many

these students has been to
consult the bus driver for
assistance. However, many
PAT employees feel that their
job is to drive, not to mediate,
and rightly so; they cannot drive
and practice clinical psychology
at the same time.

Still another possible but
highly unlikely solution is a
Brown's Hill loop route, which
would alleviate both the
crowded conditions and the ac-

commuters who depend upon
the U-bus service will find them-
selves extremely inconvenien-
ced.

Commuter Affairs Committee
member John Linko contacted
PAT’s William Maddock of the
Market Analysis Department

Pantherettes Run Down
Indiana, Ohio, I08-42-30

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Write"

The Pitt women’s track team
defeated Indiana (Pa.) and Ohio
University handily Saturday in a
triangular meet at Pitt Stadium.
The Pantherettes totaled 108 points
to Indiana’s 42 and Ohio’s 30.

A double individual winner for
the Pantherettes was freshman
Peri Jude Radecic, who won both
the shot put and discus. Pitt swept
the shot, discus and javelin,
despite the absence of team javelin
record-holder Carmen Scherich.

The host team also swept the
high jump, where Marie Ribik took
top honors, and teammates Karen
Krichko and Pam Gearing placed
right behind her. Pitt was also
victorious in the long jump, where
Cissy Wilborn and Kim Green were
one-two.

In the 440-relay, Pitt’s “A” and
“B” squads ﬁnished ﬁrst‘ and
second. The team of Wilborn,
Gwen Murray, Leslie Palmer and
Linda Mitchell won by a good
margin while Lisa Sciullo, Dee Dee
Kantner, Sue Lewis and Jan Wilk
were second over Indiana and
Ohio.

Palmer also won the 100-meter
hurdles and ran the lead-off 110 leg
of the 880-medley relay. Along
with Lisa Sciullo (110), Mitchell
(220) and Murray (440), this relay

Pitt’s Tom Liebenguth was twice a singles winner last weekend.

ﬁnished well in front of the
competition.

Murray, running the open 440,
was apparently unaffected by the
33-degree weather as she turned in
a winning time of 56.2. Pitt’s
Krichko was third in the event.

Other individual winners for Pitt ,

were Brenda Chorpenning, mile
run; Margie Lee, two-mile run;
Melanie Nickerson, three-mile run
and Paula Phillips in the javelin
competition.

Pitt’s two-mile relay of Chorpen-
ning, Maria Sciullo, Jane Strause
and Karen Bradley defeated the
Indiana entry by almost one
lap, while the mile relay of Wilk,
Gearing, Patty Szczotka and
Jeanne Drexler were second.

Kantner was second in both the
100- and 220-yard dashes. Green
was third in the 220 and Maria
Sciullo ﬁnished third in the 400
meter hurdles. I

The Pantherettes’ next meet will
be this Thursday afternoon against
Slippery Rock at 4 p.m. The
competition, will be run at Pitt
Stadium. The Pantherettes ran
against Slippery Rock indoors in
February, when Pitt was an easy
winner, but the Rockets are always
best outdoors. Sprinter Sue
Krogstad and depth in the ﬁeld and
distance events are SRSC’s strong
points.

Netters Smash Rock,
Trimph Overllkmn

By MARIA SCIULLO
PittANews Sports Editor

With weekend victories over
Slippery Rock and Akron, the
Panther men’s tennis team brought
its record to 5-3. Pitt had little
trouble with Akron Saturday
afternoon, winning 7-2 and had an
even easier time with Slippery Rock
yesterday at the Greentree Racquet
Club, 8-1.

Against the Rockets, Pitt swept
the singles competition, then
coasted in with victories in two of
three doubles matches. Panthers
MVP Tom Liebenguth started the
match with a 6-3, 6-4 decision over
SRSC’s Mark Eckendorf. Next, in
number-two singles, it was Panther
Kevin Quay over Joe Bartos, 6-3,
5-7, 6-4.

“That was our most important
match,” said Coach George Dief-
fenbach. “Keven needed the win
to get up. It was good
psychologically for him to win a
close one.”

“After losing the second set,
Kevin knew he had to come to the
netmore, and basically it was hit
match because he was in better
shape, plus he played smart
tennis.”

Other Panther wins were: singles
Dave Romito over Steve Seltzer.
6-2, 6-1; Marc Riley defeating
Chuck Vietmier, 6-1, 6-0; Tim
Gault winning an 8-1 pro set
decision over Tim Kerchinski and

Joe Mayers besting Dave Hayes,
6-2, 6-0.

Pitt ‘doubles winners were:
Liebenguth-Quay over Eckendorf-
Bartos, and Romito-Riley against
SRSC’s Seltzer and Hayes. The
Gault-Doug White combination
was the only Pitt victim, falling to
SRSC’s Vietmier-Kerchinski duo.

Against Akron. Pitt won all but
the number-two singles and num-
ber-one doubles matches. The
Panthers had spent a busy week,
ﬁrst defeating Bucknell University
for “probably the first time in 30
years,” according to Dieffenbach,
then suffering a 9-0 shutout,
compliments of the Penn State
Nittany Lions.

Liebenguth’s 7-6, 6-1 loss to
PSU’s Tim McAvoy was, said
Dieffenbach, “our best match."
The coach also cited the number
two doubles match of Pit's Romito
and Riley against Jon Whiteside
and McAlvoy as one that could
have gone either way. The
Panther’s lost. 7-6, 7-6, with a
score of 5-4 at both tiebreakers.

Up until now. Pitt wins over
Duquesne, 8-l; Westminster. 9-0;
the week-end victories plus Buck-
nell, and losses to PSU, Richmond,
8-1 and Old Dominion, 7-2, have
constituted the Pitt spring season.
Today the team takes on California
State at Trees Courts. The match
will begin at 1 p.m.

Pole vaulter Gene Roach was the
only Panther to win an event at the
Colonial Relays at William and
Mary University last weekend.

Roach’s vault of 15 feet was
made despite a strong 30-mile-per
hour wind and‘ ‘ coach Mike

.Agostinella called it a “super

vault.”
The next highest ﬁnisher for Pitt

was the one-mile relay team, which,

placed ﬁfth. The team of Larry
Shippen, Bud Cooper, Dwayne
DeFoor and Keith Leckenby
ﬁnished in 3:18.3.

The two-mile relay team of

-Darren Geary, Greg Conover, Bill

McShea and Joel Albers was sixt
with a time of 7:37. ~ ‘

Another Pitt high point was
Mark Studnicki’s seventh-place
ﬁnish in the 10,000 meter run. He
ﬁnished in 30:17 in what Agostin-
ella called “an excellent time.”

The relays were open to both
college and club teams (52 were
represented) and according to
Agostinella, the level of- competi-
tition was excellent.

“There were many Olympic
competitors there,” said Agostin-
ella, “including Steve Riddick and
Charlie Foster.’_’ Riddick was a
member of the gold metal winning
400-meter relay team and Foster
was a silver medalist in the high
hurdles.

“This meet was a step forward
for most of our athletes,” said

Agostinella. “We try to use the
stepping stone approach for our
season and this was our second
step.” '
Steve Roebuck placed eighth in
the javlin in a steep ﬁeld of
competition, .according to Agos-
tinella. He said Panthers ran into
tough competition in all of the ﬁeld
events except the pole vault.

Agostinella said the sprint
medley and 400-medley runners
were improved over ‘last week, but
didn’t fare well due to training
conditions in Pittsburgh. »

“Our sprinters were unable to
get much fast work done, while the
schools from the South were better

because of all the outside work a

theyiye had already,” he said.
“For\‘the amount of training we’ve
had, we’ve done a pretty good
job.” 0 .

Another Panther performer was
Curt Goltz, who tied his best time
of 55 seconds flat in the
intermediate hurdles.

“Curt ran \a good race, but we
know he is capable of doing
better,” said Agostinella. “His
was one of the races marred by bad
weather.” '

Randy Bailey improved his time
in the steeple chase by 13 seconds,
ﬁnishing in 9:36.

The Panthersywill next compete
in the Dogwood Relays at Knox-
ville, Tenn. this weekend. Only the
one-and two-mile relay teams
qualiﬁed to compete.

Pitt Vo|Ieyba||’s Robbins Setsllp First-Year Team

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt mens’ volleyball team
may be in its initial season of play,
but junior setter Scott Robbins is
a veteran. Robbins has been
playing volleyball since his child-
hood days in Northern Detroit,
Michigan. ~

“I grew up playing volleyball,”

Robbins said. “My father used to
play, and I would go to tourna-
ments with him when I was young.
One day I started playing on his
YMCA team, and have been
playing ever since.”

Robbins was unable to play
organized team ball while at Lahser
High School in Michigan because
there wasn’t a team. He

compensated for this by playing on
a local United States Volleyball
Association (USVA) team. Also, as
a 17-year-old senior, he held the
position of assistant coach for the
girl’s team at his high school.
“Some other guys and myself
wanted to play on the girl’s varsity
team but we were ruled against, so

“I chose Kellogg over other

R Leftfielder Kline Out
  To Better Average

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt baseball player Rich Kline
is, according to teammate Jim
Pastin, “a great, great hitter.

“I’ve learned a lot just watching
him,” said Pastin, no slouch
himself as a hitter. “Rich knows
what he’s doing.”

“I try to stick to the fundamen-
tals,” Kline explained. “I don’t do
anything fancy. I would rather hit
the ball solidly ﬁve times in a row
than get two cheap hits.”

Kline, a sophomore from Miami,
Fla, was the Panthers’ leading
hitter last season with a .333
batting average.

“To bat over .333 would be a
really good year for anybody.” said
Kline, who admires major league
stars Dave Parker, Rod Carew and
George Foster. for their hitting
abilities. “My main goal, other
than winning, is improving each
year.

“Last year, I had a good year
because I didn’t strike out that
much,” added Kline, who was
moved from sixth to third in the
batting order. “I can’t afford to
strike out this year, either. Batting
third, Ihave to hit and make things
happen, because there will be men
on base.”

Kline started the season well,
hanging out three hits in the season
opening doubleheader sweep of
Carnegie-Mellon.

“We expect Rich to pick up
where he left off last season and
have another good year,” Pitt
coach Bob Lewis said.

Lewis expects Kline to have
more extra base hits this season.
The sophomore stroked a double

against Carnegie-Mellon last week 

Leftﬁelder Kline takes as muérr
pride in his defensive abilities as he
does in his hitting.

“I’ve worked hard this season as
far as my ﬁelding is concerned,”
he said. “I’ve been practicing
playing balls off of the fence. I had
trouble in that area last season.”

Although he’s from Miami,
Kline is familiar with Pittsburgh,

having played his first sandlot
baseball game at nearby Frick
Park. Kline’s father, Stuart,

graduated from Pitt and was a
starting center on the Panther
football team in the mid-S0’s. i

The younger Kline attended
Miami’s Palmetto High School,
where he starred in both baseball
and football. He was impressive in
a tryout with the Baltimore Orioles
last year, collecting two hits in a
game the major league team held
for 40 of the 300 players who tried
out.

An economics major, Kline
dreams of playing professional
baseball. Many of his friends are
now in the minor leagues.

BASEBALL NOTES: Saturday’s
doubleheader at Kent State was
called off because of cold weather.
Pitt (2-0) meets Robert ‘Morris
tomorrow in a twin bill at Trees
Field. The first game starts at one
o’clock.

Pitcher Allen Lachowicz is
scheduled to start one of the
games. Teammates say the
freshman has “a wicked curve
ball.”

Pitt hasn’t played since the
Carnegie-Mellon doubleheader a
week-and-a-half ago.

concentration on volleyball in the
school, so the team was put
through a vigorous training
schedule starting in August for the
opener in January.

“Our varsity team was big and
experienced,” said Robbins, “so
starting out I played for the club
team. We were one of the
strongest teams in the midwest
leagues.”

After two successful years at
Kellogg, Robbins had to once again
t’.E.d another team to play on. This
is when he made the decision to
come to Pitt, where the program
was in its early stage.

“I was referred to Pitt by Mick.‘

He told me about the new program
and he highly recommended Coach‘
Hebert,” said Robbins. “He had a
lot of influence in my decision to
come here.”

Robbins came to Pitt and landed
a starting position after only one
game. He believes that Pitt and
Hebert have done a lot to better his
career due to the experience that
he has had this season.

“Coach Hebert has a great deal
of knowledge about the game. He
has really helped me out a lot
because I’ve been able to get a lot
more personal instruction from him
that I wasn’t able to get from Mick
in two years. He has changed a few
of my techniques,” said Robbins,

“changes that I find have allowed
me to improve.”

Robbins knew he was going to
become a part of a building
program for the ﬁrst year team.
The season has shown a lot of
improvement since those first few
weeks of practices.

“The team has become a lot
more dependent on each other,”
said Robbins. “During the ﬁrst
week of practice some of the guys
couldn’t hit the ball over the top of
the net, and with the increase in
jumping ability they can almost put
the ball straight down.

“The most improved player I’ve
seen has been Mark Ochs, along
with Craig Kowalski, Brian Devine

F

and Ivo Lucic. You can’t give
enough credit to these guys who
didn’t see much playing time in the
start of the season. In the last few
weeks they have come into the
game and really put more desire
into us. They have improved the
attitude of the entire team.”

“Scott, along with Jeff Beavers,
are the quarterbacks of our team,”
said Hebert. “They have turned in
the strongest performances on the
team, showing a mature type of
ball handling.”

As the ‘Panthers look towards
their future in volleyball, Robbins
believes that the addition of some
good recruits will help Pitt.

“We aren’t going to know what

  WHEN YOU’RE HUNGRY....

next vear’s going to be like until we
are there,” said Robbins.

“Recruits and players returning
from this season with experience
will prove Pitt to be a decent
team.”

Although the Panthers have not
had the best of luck in their first
season, Robbins still considers his
decision to come to Pitt a successful
one.

B’ “This season has deﬁnitely been
a worthwhile one for me,” said
Robbins. “I came here to get some
good coaching, playing time and
more experience,” he added.
“I’ve received all of these, and I
feel that my purpose has been
fulfilled.”
