McGovern :

By LEONARD ROMBERG
Pitt News Staff Writer

Senator George McGovern (D-
_S.D.), addressing an audience of
over 300 persons in the Student
Union Ballroom Monday night, said
solar energy is the long-range key to
solving America’s energy crisis.

Calling President Carter's energy
proposal, which emphasizes de-
regulation and conservation, .“deﬁ-
cient,” he outlined what he
considered an “intelligent energy
policy for the United States.”

“If we would invest $1 billion in
solar energy, we could make solar
energy a viable and usable option
for the American people,” Mc-
Govern said.

A Democratic presidential candi-
date in 1972, McGovern was the
key-note speaker of the program
“Waste and Want...the Conse-
quences of the Energy Crisis,”
presented by the University Chap-
lains Association and the Pitcairn-
Crabbe Foundation.

McGovern said decentralized
usage of solar energy is necessary in
both old and new buildings.

Key Energy In the Sun

“What we need is a system to

induce homeowners and contractors S

to accept it,” he said.

“We knowhow to harness solar
energy,” McGovern added. “The
technology has existed for commer-
cial purposes. What's missing
today is a commitment by the
American government and people.

Attacking the Carter energy
package, McGovern said only 4
percent of the money allocated was

r for development of solar, wind, and

biological energy sources.

“That is less than one ﬁfth of
what is to be spent on nuclear
ﬁssion,” he said.

“I worry about the drift toward a
nuclear future for our country,” he
said, citing waste disposal and an
increasing chance for accident as
nuclear dangers.

“Someone suggested South
Dakota as one of six lightly
inhabited areas to dump nuclear
waste, McGovern said. “We
might not have many people in
South Dakota, but we don’t want to
die.” V

The Senator said the energy

question is directly tied to issues
such as jobs, inflation and
deterioration of the environment.
He said millions of jobs could be
provided by investing in the civilian
sector, speciﬁcally into new energy
sources.

McGovern also called for a
revitalization of the nation’s
railroad system “even if it takes a
major public investment.”

“I hear people always talking
about how the United States has to
be number one, but they are always
talking about bombers and missiles.
Iwould like to see a commitment to
build the ﬁnest rail system within 15
years,” McGovern said.

Responding to a question from
the audience, McGovern rated
President Carter’s performance,
giving the President good ratings on
the Panama Canal treaty, blocking
production of the B-1 bomber,
Middle East peace attempts and
human rights.

He criticized Carter’s lack of
progress on combatting unemploy-
ment, inﬂation, the energy shortage
and urban problems.

Revamping Next Week

By DAVE KIRSHN ER

Pitt News Staff Writer
The ﬁrst phase‘ for renovating the
inside of Schenley Hall is set for

next week when the building’s first ,

seven floors: will be measured-,
according to Student Activities
Director Willard "Bu-d” Heaps." .
The architectural firm of
Williams/Trebilcock/ Whitehead
recently contracted to design plans
for ‘the structure’s revitalization.
will send a representative to survey
all spaces from the basement to the
seventh ﬂoor. .
“This is the beginning,” Heaps
said. “After the measurements
have been completed, the architects

you have, this is what you'll be able

to do.’ "
Heaps, who

” operational schedules from organi-

Student'Union. _

' “We don’t "want to interrupt any
operations,” he said. “Every
attempt will be made to work
around the schedules.”

Avoiding inconveniences to the
groups involved will be a major
problem for the renovation program
in its attempt to restore the 80-year-
old structure, Heaps has said.

Original proposals for construc-

. conference.

The hearing centered on
Baylson’s interpretation of whether
enough SGB votes had been cast to
pass funding for travel costs to a
national conference on campus

programming in New Orleans.

Earlier this month, the alloca-
tions committee had twice struck
down the board’s funding request,
leaving it to the board to
“re-construct,” or formulize and
pass a ﬁnal ﬁgure. The board voted
4-0 in favor with three abstentions,
but under the SGB constitution, ﬁve
afﬁrmative votes are needed for
passage.

In the absence of a parlimen-
tarian, Baylson consulted a rule
guide based partially on Robert’s
Rules of Order. Baylson sub-
sequently interpreted the vote to be
in favor of the funding-, clearing the
way for him and SGB niembeg Jan
M"edoff- to attend the New Orleans

challenged Baylson’s interpreta-

judicial committee ruled in favor of

Baylson said after the vote that he
was not surprised at the decision.
“The question was ambiguous
enough. It could have gone either
way.

“It’s good now that we have a
precedent so these problems don’t

arise again,” headded. “It’s a
reasonable decision by the
J-board.”

The judicial board also ruled that
Baylson’s’ interpretation was

_“reasonable” and no sanctions

were imposed.

based on feasibility and cost
considerations.

Appropriations for the project
have not been finalized.

Heaps believes initial reaction to
the program is encouraging. “Res-
ponses have been phenomenal
already,” he said.

Since its early history as a
first-class hotel, the building has
been the focus of much criticism.

Overcrowded conditions and
inefficient means of moving people
have been sourcesof complaint in
recent years. Heaps pointed to
improving elevators and generally
modernizing facilities as key
objectives.

He added that student input will
be integral to the renovation plans.

fit McGovern:Wcn‘is, Money, Mid East



By LEONARD ROMBERG
Pitt News Staffwriter

Energy, economics and the
Middle East were three topics
George McGovern (D-S.D.) dis-
cussed during a 20-minute news
conference Monday afternoon at
WPGH radio.

Responding to questions from
WPGH, Dr. Ted Windt of the
speech department and The Pitt
News, McGovern said the energy
bill now in Congress is a “rather
sad package.”

The bill would move the country
toward complete deregulation of
natural gas prices within seven
years, McGovern said.

“I don’t think that is the moral
equivalent of war,” he said.
“That’s the moral equivalent of
surrendering to the big oil
companies that are already charg-
ing very high prices for the oil and
gas we depend on.”

He said Congress has not
“moved an inch” towards divesti-
ture of the energy industry since
1972. The legislation would prevent
the major oil companies from
buying major coal reserves and
nuclear power plants, and from
moving into the solar energy field.

“I’m frankly more worried about
major sources of energy being
gobbled up by a few major
combinations of capital,” Mc-
Govern added. “The best we can do

as the dates and locations for each
event.

Snyder said the coed ﬂoors may
expand to three floors this year to
include Tower B’s 17th ﬂoor,
(which is currently all-female) if
enough interest is expressed.

“We’re hoping to create enough
interest in that unit to expand it,”
Snyder said. “All of the special
units tend to be a little nicer than
the regular rooms in terms of
interaction.”

“It’s still up to the individual
resident to know what he’s getting
into,” Snyder stressed. “But the
RA’s should be able to give them
the needed information. If anyone

they should start by asking their
RA.”

Snyder said there has been a
great deal of interest in the new
international floors in Bruce Hall.
Though the dormitory is undergo-
ing renovations, Snyder said, some
sort of presentations would be
given during the open houses to

give interested students an idea

about how the unit will be

constructed.

"We’ve had about 18 requests
already," Snyder said. “When that
happens this early, it's a good
indication that there's a lot of
interest in the unit.”

is muster 25 votes in the Senate.
This is a measure of the lobbying
power of the (oil companies.)”
McGovern said he favored a $1
billion investment in solar energy
and an effort to properly insulate
homes and buildings as the best
energy policy for the nation.

Though American dependence on
Middle East oil has increased in the
past five years, McGovern said, “I
don’t think its fair to say that our
policy in the Middle East is being
dictated by oil.

“It’s clear that we’ve placed
ourselves in a position where it
could become a very powerful
weapon. To that extent it does limit
the amount of freedom as far as
American foreign policy is concern-
ed.”

McGovern said he is “troubled”
by President Carter’s plan to sell
sophisticated jet ﬁghters to Egypt,
Israel and Saudi Arabia.

“I would go along with Secretary
Vance’s idea that if we are going to
sell planes at a delicate time like
this, we would have to on a package
basis,” said McGovern, who favors
a “scaling down” of the entire
plane deal.

“You can’t sell to one side and

 

Mudrick photo

not to the other if you are going to
play the role of an even-handed,
honest broker. I’m really not sold
yet that Saudi Arabia needs 60 of
the most sophisticated ﬁghters.”

On other issues, McGovern said
he favored direct cash grants to
lower income college students
supporting a plan already proposed
by President Carter. He termed
direct grants as “a more efficient
way” to help the students, rather
than a tax’ write-off plan proposed
by Senator Moynihan (D-N.Y.).

Responding to a question about
the behavior of college students, he
said, “One doesn’t have quite as
much time for social protest or
political action. The number-one
worry is getting a job. It forces
young people to think very soberly
about their economic future.”

McGovern said his plans for 1980
are to run for re-election in the
Senate. “I've just taken Senator
Humphrey’s place on the Joint
Economic Committee and I’m still
working on the Foreign Relations
and Agricultural Committees.

“I’m getting a senior status on all
those committees and I rather hate
to give them up to make a race for
anything else.”

The l-Board Ruling

The Student Government Judicial Board last night ruled that the
SGB constitution is speciﬁc in its requirement of five affirmative
votes to reconstruct an Allocations Committee budget recommen-
dation. Therefore, the Judicial Board ruling stated, Robert’s Rules
of Order do not apply, and SGB President Josh Baylson was in-
correct when he changed a 4-0-3 vote to 7-0 in order to appropriate
funds for two board members to attend the National Entertainment
and Campus Activities Association conference in New Orleans last
weekend. The Judicial f Board recommended that no sanctions be

imposed on Baylson or the Board.

We think the ruling was a wise one, insofar as it clarifies the
situation and sets a solid precedent that allows the Allocations
Committee to act as a limited check on the Board.

We are a bit disturbed, however, at the way last night’s hearing
proceeded. It was marred by an unnecessarily large amount of
disorder and confusion at times, even to the point that the two sides
felt compelled to argue with one another over who was and who
was not in or out of order. The Judicial Board’s seeming inability
to firmly direct the proceedings may be the result of inexperience
(they consider cases rather infrequently), but it is important that
they be sure of proper procedure when a case is before them.
Otherwise, the reliability of their judgement can be open to
question on fundamental grounds, and their effectiveness will be

reduced.

The Allocations Committee should be commended for its atten-
tion to this case and its efforts in representing what it saw as the
best interest of all Pitt students. The allocations process within
student government has been hampered by inefficiency and
disorganization in the recent past, and we are happy to see things
running smoothly and strongly once again.

Likewise, Board president Josh Baylson has displayed good
judgement in his acceptance of the Judicial Board ruling without
further argument. By doing so, he allows himself and the rest of the
Board to get on with providing an effective student govern-
ment—which is, after all, the point of all this.

  Letters to the Editor

Comments on Proposed Animal Facility

In response to the general poor
quality of the editorials in The; Pitt
News. I wish to comment on, the
Feb. 17 issue entitled “Pitt’s
Priorities,” which dealt with the
subject of the proposed animal
facility for the medical school.

If medical professionals are such
“notoriously good - lobbyists, ’ ’ as
the article states, then why has
tuition increased from $1,500 per
year in 1974 to $4,000 now? Tuition
is even higher for out-of-state
students. -

I do not propose to analyze
Governor Shapp’s psyche in trying
to ﬁgure out why he proposed $10.7

Lengthy Adventures in the PAT Triangle

Initially, I would like to thank all
of the excellent schedulers em-
ployed during the last five years at
PAT. There are no printable words
to describe your unrelenting
service. Originally, I thought the
13th as a bad luck omen was
reserved for Fridays only. But,
alas! I The wizards of Port Authority
Transit have added new meaning to
the term Blue Monday; that’s blue
as in numb. All of this praise is due
to the completely new experience
that I had on the 13th—of February.

Having completed my 3:00 p.m.
class at Pitt, I immediately
proceded to the closest “bus stop”
(mistake #1), seeing that I wanted to
catch a 61A (mistake #2) to my home
town of Swi_ssvale (mortal sin #1).

At this point, I would like to
apologize for my ignorant parents
having chosen Swissvale as a site of
permanent residence eons ago.
How were they to know that PAT
doesn't like to provide adequate
serviceto any town beginning with a
consonant.

I thusly began my vigil at 3:57
(having been given a digital watch
last Christmas). By 4:32, an elderly
woman who vowed to catch
whatever bus came next, whether or
not it was a 61A, caught a 54C to
Lawrenceville. However, my faith
in God was restored at 4:53, as a
61A was spotted at Hillman Library,
nary 3 blocks away. My faith was
further restored in your service as
that bus passed us by 12 red-lights

million for an animal facility in light
of the general contraction of
University funding. I do know,
however, that obtaining animals for
both medical student teaching and
for basic research is an extremely
critical problem. The animal
facilities that currently exist are
7woefully inadequate for the kind
and quality of research that a
medical center such as Pitt
requires.
The statement, “What we need
now is not so much better doctors as
more doctors, ’ ’ is simply ridiculous.
- There is no doctor shortage in the
U.S. There is a doctor ma1distribu-
tion, with most doctors electing to

specialize and remain in urban»

areas, rather than becoming
primary care health providers in
needy areas. If Pitt expanded its
clinical facilities, as the editorial
suggested, this would only serve to
increase the number of specialists
serving urban areas.

As for the ﬁnal contention in the
editorial--that somehow funding an

animal facility will increase physi-
cian fees (the logic of which is

unclear to me)--I wish to offer the

following facts: Physicians’ fees are
only a small percentage of the total
cost of health care in the U.S. The
largest proportion of the total cost of
health care goes toward hospitali-
zation costs, laboratory tests and
supporting the vast army of
auxilliary personnel in the health
care industry (nurses, lab technic-
ians, orderlies, X-ray technicians,
et).
The

ideals espoused in the

editorial (lowering tuition costs,

increasing the number of minority
students in medical education,
lowering health care costs, et.) are
very nice. However, to simply
espouse these ideals without even a
rudimentary understanding of the
real and complex issues involved is
an unnecessary waste of time and
effort.

Restrictive Library Policies

Recently, . it has come to my
attention that one of the most
important facilities that this, or any
university, provides for its stu-
dents--its library system--is not
equally available to all students
enrolled here.

I attempted to borrow a book from
Scaife Library and was told that my
status as an undergraduate student
in CA5 was inadequate to allow me
to borrow that book. Apparently,

borrowing privileges at that branch, ‘

of the University library system are
limited to graduate students and
students in ' the health-related
professions. . Thus, I, and the
thousands of other students enroll-
ed in this University who do not fall
into one of the two privileged
groups, am denied the use of this
valuable tool. I am offended.

It seems reasonable that if one
group has their own private library,
others might also. Perhaps each
department might decide to deny

Opinion

The Interdisciplinary Curriculum at Harvard A

By. R. DAVID TIVE

Harvard University is the most
prestigious institution of higher
education in this country. That is
not to say that it is the best, but
merely that it is the best-known
and has proven over time to be a
pacesetter in the United States.
That is why when Harvard
undertakes a major restructuring of
its undergraduate curriculum, it
gets front-page coverage in The
New York Times. That is why the
proposed restructuring will be food
for discussion on campuses
throughout the country, including
this one.

What has been proposed by the
dean of arts and sciences at
Harvard is a sharp break from the
trend toward “general education”
and a move back in the direction of
a slightly more structured core
curriculum. In layman’s terms, it
means an end to the complete
freedom of students to pick
whatever courses they want to
complete their degree require-
ments, and the imposition of some
minimal standard requirements
that must be met by all students
before they can graduate.

The author of the proposal, Dean
Henry Rosovsky, says he is trying
to define the label “educated
person.” He is trying to establish
some sort of common denominator
so that being educated will mean
more than having taken a collection
of often unrelated courses adding
up to some magical number of
credits.

Rosovsky’s plan is not the
traditional distribution require-
ments of humanities, natural
sciences, social sciences and
foreign language. There are ﬁve
areas in which students must take
course: literature and the arts;
history; social and philosophical
analysis; science and mathematics,
and foreign language and culture.
The key element is the interdis-
ciplinary nature of each area. The
literature and arts component, for
example, cannot be satisfied

simply by taking courses on
modern drama or the American
short story. At least one course
must be taken that shows the
connection between literature and
the arts and their social and
historical context. A course on the
political thought and impact of
pre-revolutionary Russian novelists
would satisfy the requirement. It
might also help satisfy the
requirements for history and
foreign language and culture.
Because of the interdisciplinary
and overlapping nature of the ﬁve
areas, the new Harvard require-
ments could be met by taking as
few as seven, or as many as 10
courses. It amounts to only
one-quarter of a student’s full load
over four years. But no matter how
it is accomplished, the act of

. achieving the goals set for each

student will, says Rosovsky, insure

that each student has the oppor-
tunity to develop “basic literacy in
major forms of intellectual dis-
course.”

The situation that Rosovsky is
trying to remedy is one in which

THOUGHTS AND
REFLECTIONS

students are allowed to take
whatever courses they wish for four
years, whether or not those courses
provide any breadth of knowledge
for the student. If there are some
basic requirements, there is no
attempt made to relate them to the
student’s,major ﬁeld of study. A
pre-med major, for example, may
be required to take some history
and some literature, but in the
absence of any indication as to how
they are related to medicine, the
student views them as a discon-

tinuous break in his or her studies,
not as a necessary broadening of
academic interest.

Another problem with the
current system, and one that does
not seem to be addressed by the
Harvard proposal, is most students
are not encouraged to form their
four-year curriculum into a co-
herent or uniﬁed pattern. The “kid
in a candy shop” technique is used,
where students are shown the
whole array of courses and allowed
to pick whichever one is prettiest. If
all students were required, at some
point, to describe the objectives

they are trying to achieve by taking;

the courses they choose, then all
students would have to give more
thought to their course selection
and would be.more likely to take
courses from which they can
beneﬁt.

But even with such a system,

Rosovsky’s concept of a “common
denominator” for educated people
is an interesting and probably valid
one. It is one that deserves further
study, both here and elsewhere. If
a decision is made to go back to a
more structured curriculum, every
effort should be taken to avoid the
Chinese menu approach where a
student picks one from Column A
and two from Column B.

The interdisciplinary approach,
supplemented by a student-
initiated, uniﬁed plan of study, is
probably the way to go. That
insures the implementation of
Rosovsky’s common denomi-
nator” while retaining the best
elements of the current system--a
student’s freedom of choice and the
opportunity to undertake a wide
range of academic and intellectual
experiences.

Por1smou’rh's Cancer Rate

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—Adm. Hyman
G. Rickover disputed yesterday an
independent study suggesting an
unusually high cancer death rate at
the Portsmouth Naval Yard and
called for a major nationwide probe

into the health efects of all
radiation.
“It will be an enormous

undertaking, far‘ outstripping the
isolated case of Portsmouth, or even
encompassing all the shipyards,”
Rickover, head of the Navy’s nuclear
submarine program, told a con-
gressional hearing.

He testified as House and Senate
health subcommittees began a joint
investigation into allegations that
nuclear workers at the Portsmouth
Naval Shipyard have a cancer death
rate twice the national average.

The Boston blood specialist who
headed that study, Dr. Thomas
Najarian, testified that the Navy
and the Veterans Administration,
for which he works, had tried to
hamper that investigation.

Najarian said he was forced to
conduct the probe himself, with the
help of a Boston Globe investigative
team, after the federal government
threw up numerous roadblocks.

Rickover said radiation safety
standards heeded at’ Portsmouth
and the eight other shipyards
handling nuclear subs are far more
stringent than federal minimum
standards.

“Maybe we haven’t done
enough,” Rickover testified." “I’m
not saying there isn’t a problem...
But from the best of our knowledge
at present, we don’t see a
problem.”

Najarian testified that his investi-
gation found that the cancer rate
among nuclear workers at the
shipyard, in Maine near Ports-
mouth, N.H., was 38.4 percent
compared to the national average of
18 percent.

And he said the death rate for
leukemia among former nuclear
workers at the shipyard was four
times the expected level.

Rickover, the prime mover
behind the nation’s nuclear sub
program from its inception, said the
Navy has a radiation safety record
“which I believe can stand close
scrutiny. ”’

But he added that “the ﬁeld of
radiation effects has been one
where insufficient effort has been
expended."

“We have now lived with
man-made radiation for over 30
years, and there is sufficient data
available to make a reasonable
judgment as to what our national
policy should be. An analysis on a
nationwide scale is long overdue,”
he testified.

Rep. Paul Rogers, D-Fla.,
chairman of the House health
subcommittee, told Rickover, “I
think we are all agreed that we need
to do a study.”

He noted that workers at the
nation’s,other eight nuclear ship-
yard may have been subjected to
similar risks. These include
government yards at Norfolk, Va.;
Puget Sound, Wash.; Charleston,
S.C.; Mare Island, Calif.; and Pearl
Harbor, Hawaii; and private
shipyards at Groton, Conn.; New-
port News, Va.; and Pascagoula,

By KEN GORMLEY

“Okay. Who will it be today?”
With a black leather whip twirling
dangerously above his head, the
small, broad-shouldered man
waded into the kennelfull of
yelping hounds.

A white and brown spotted
hound was anxious to offer his
services. Tongue hanging out, he
bolted between the man’s legs, ran
around in circles to celebrate his
freedom. and tried to leap into the
closed gate of the idling pickup.

The man bellowed, and. grab-
bing the dog by his long left ear.
tossed him back into the sea of
furry white bodies. “...the hell
back in there. You’re not going
nowhere today.”

“Be gentle with them, Jeff.”

He eyed the rotund little
woman—-bundled up in a half
dozen layers of sweatshirts and
levis—and pushed a greasy strand
of black hair out of his eyes, almost
apolegetically. “Do we got 14 yet?
Yeah. Okay. Let's go.”

All three of us crowded into the
front of the dark green pickup,
which was equipped with massive
fog-lights to cut through the
meanest Massachusettes mists. A
conspicuous silver ornament-—a
foxhunter on horseback——glim-
mered on the hood.

Jeff stuck it into third. We raised
a cloud of dust chugging down the
gravel road that wound through the
plush Myopia Hunt Club domain: a
little stream, well-kept stables,
even thick green polo ﬁelds.

“Fox hunting, you see, started
back in England,” Jeff yelled
above the bellowing dogs. “God-
damn you.” He pounded on the
rear window. They were quiet.
“Back then, there were foxes all
over the place, raiding henhouses
and doing lots of damage. So a
farmer would organize a hunt to
catch the critters.

“Nowadays, you see, it's just a
sport,” he continued. “And it’s too
crowded to hunt live fox anymore-
except in some of them giant
Southern plantations down in
Virginia, where they can get very
snooty about the whole thing. So
most of the foxhunts these days are
just drag hunts.”

We soon arrived at the Byrd
Estate—a three-and—a-half square
mile chunk of land in Ipswich,
owned by a 90-year-old man who
doesn't use the estate for much
more than to see the foxhunters
ride through once a year, and
maybe add a newspaper clipping to
his scrapbook. The road was lined
with horse-trailers, which were
blanketed with a layer of noisy.
hungry ﬂies.

“Drag hunts?” I said, my mind
wandering back to our conversa-
tion. “I’m almost afraid to ask...”

“Nothing obscene about it,” Jeff
said. “Some fellah, Charley Jones,
goes out about an hour before the
hunt on horseback. Him and the
Master of Foxhounds decide
beforehand where the hunt will go.
Old Charley soaks a couple of his
beat-up ﬂannel shirts with the
scent, ties them to a rope, and just
rides along dragging it on the
ground. That’s why they call"it a
‘drag’ hunt, you see.”

By now, the hounds—still
imprisoned in the caged enclosure

' _..._un1<n;t::::wI:¢‘I"-=‘—*
 - '  “ —

in the back of the pickup——were
squawking like a flock of constip-
ated geese.

“There's one thing I don’t
understand,” I said to Jeff, quickly
stepping back as a passing horse
unceremoniously dropped a steam-
ing pile of dung next to my shoe.
“Why- do the hounds chase after
the scent, when they never ﬁnd a
fox? Don’t they catch on after the
ﬁrst few times? Don’t they get
bored chasing invisible foxes?”

“Goddamned if I know.” He
unbolted the cage door, and the
hounds slid down the ramp to the
ground in playful heaps. “Must be
stupid.” V

Fifty or 60 hunters were, by now,
assembled in the Byrds’ Estate
meeting place. In the middle of it
all, a distinguished silver—haired
man sat on horseback, dressed
meticulously in the most proper of
riding apparel—-a trim black suit,
carefully starched ruffled shirt,
little black riding cap balanced, just
right, on the top of his head. This

/

man was Neil Ayer, but most
people just called him Mr. Ayer.
He was the Master of Foxhounds.

“What a lovely day. Isn't it
super?” He welcomed each new-
comer with the same carefully
enunciated greeting, the same jolly
good smile.

One quick blast of his golden
snail-shaped horn was all it took.
Mr. Ayer was instantly surrounded
by the pack of hounds—be1lowing
and drooling, hungry to -sink their
teeth into an imaginary fox.

“Kayeee!” It was almost unbe-
coming. Mr. Ayer let loose a
Comanche-like scream, and
streaked into the neighboring ﬁeld
where his hounds picked up the
scent. A long procession of men.
women and children on horseback
trailed behind their leader.

"We'd best get the hell outta
here." Jeff yelled, as he jumped
into the pickup. “We got some
huntin’ to do."

A couple of miles up the road.
beside a giant clover ﬁeld enclosed

by a rusting barbed wire fence, we
pulled up and waited for the hunt
to arrive. Jeff ﬁddled with his
wristwatch.

“They'll get here in a minute or
two,” he said. “The wind's a little

‘strong. Could carry the scent aways

and confuse the hounds a little.”

“What's the scent made out of?
It must smell pretty good if those
dogs are stupid enough to follow it
for hours at a time.”

“Smell good?" he said. “They
make that stuff down in Arizona.
It's some mixture of fox, coyote,
and mink urine. Smell good? It
comes to the Post Ofﬁce triple-
sealed. And they call us right away
and beg us to please come by and
pick it up.”

Horses. The sound of their
hooves pounding on the cold
ground drifted through the quiet
winter air like an approaching
freight train. Then the hounds.
They poured onto the ﬁeld—a
caravan of huntsmen in pursuit-
and bolted through the knee-high

hay. The echo of each howl
bounced off the New England hills.
They were on to something.
Faster now. Ears streaming
behind them.. They were approach-
ing a little stone wall, legs tensing
for the leap. And they stopped.
Sniffed here. Sniffed there. Then
settled back down on their
haunches, looking around with
mild curiosity. Of all the lazy...
The Master of Foxhounds belted
out a series of notes on his horn,
and the dogs and hunters——all of
them panting heavily—followed
him to a little grassy spot. “This is
what we call a checkpoint,” Mr.
Ayer said, beaming graciously
from his steed. “It simulates a real
hunt—'-where a fox might crawl
along a wall or through a pond to
lose the scent."
The hunters, their hats tipped
askew andshirts slightly wrinkled,
congratulated Mr. Ayer on his
ingenious maneuvers to baffle the
hounds, and sunk into their

saddles, gulping down fresh air

and clutching their aching sides.
The hounds seemed oblivious to
the disappearance of the scent, and
made good use of the break by
playing nip-the-nose with each
other and wallowing through a
conveniently located mudpuddle.
After a good 10 minutes. Jeff and
I hurried back to the truck and set
out for the next check point. In the
rearview mirror I could see the silly
hounds bounding along, back on
the scent of that imaginary fox.
“I'm not sure I understand why
you get paid to drive around in this
truck following the hunt," I said.

~“I’m sure it's not very often that

one of the hounds gets mauled by
the fox...”

“You’re right abc that,” he
chuckled. “But eve nce in a
while a hound or a hunter gets
hurt. You know, trips over a fence
or gets tangled up in barbed wire.
Me and my wife——she follows in the
other truck—gotta be ready for
anything like that.

“But there's more to it than
that,” Jeff said. “Most of the

check points are between one
estate and another. We gotta make
sure the dogs stay in line, and don’t
decide to chase a neighbor’s dog
across a lawn or something.

Remember—wherever the dogs go,’

the horses go. Ever see a lawn after
ﬁfty horses stamped across it? Or
the owner of the lawn?”

“Out of the road, please. Can’t
you see you’re blocking our view?”
A swelling crowd of spectators,
most wielding Nikons and Pin-
taxes, angrily waved us off the road
and directed us into a muddy gully,
out of the line of cameraﬁre. The
group, men in tweed sportcoats
and women in chic ankle-length
skirts, waited for the arrival of the
hunters with a sort of nervous
suspense, like a bunch of four-year
olds waiting in line to. use th
lavatory. _ 

“What’s the big attraction?” I
asked. “Looks like the opening
night of the Boston Symphony.
Maybe I should go home and
change."

“Oh, these people always show
up to take pictures here. See that
fence over there?” Jeff pointed to a
four-foot structure of logs built
across the trail.

I nodded.

“Well the hunters jump over
that. So they have their friends and
families come out and take pictures
of them. Makes for good action
shots. One fellah used to come out
here every week and snap pictures
as fast as he could push the button.
Then he’d send the proofs to these
people and, naturally, they
couldn’t resist buying them from
him. Guy made a fortune.”

The late afternoon air was
starting to get colder, so cold that
Jeff and I didn’t bother getting out
of the truck at the next check point.

Instead, we watched the comedy ‘

from behind steamed windows.

First, as usual, came the yelping
hounds. A little tired of ﬁnding no
foxes, they were in hot pursuit of a
pink-eared jackrabbit. Next came
the “whips”—three oldtimers
whose job was to keep the
foxhounds from straying from the
course by masterfully cracking
their whips. (Unfortunately, most
lacked the coordination and
strength to make their whips crack,
and ended up wrapping the thin
leather straps around their horses’
necks.) Last came the hunters, who
cordially tipped their hats as they
followed the jumbled procession on
its last leg.

II! II‘ III * It

“Gypsy. Governor. There’s a
good fellow.”

The hunt had ended abruptly;
anti-climactically, as far as I was
concerned. But not as far as the
hounds were concerned. Mr.
Ayer—happy that they had pur-
sued the imaginary fox so
artfully——called each hound by
name, and rewarded him with
mounds of horsemeat (which
probably explains what happens to
old, tired horses when they’re
forced to retire from foxhunting ).

One by one, the hunters stopped
by to thank Mr. Ayer for such a
splendid hunt. He graciously
accepted each compliment with a
cock of the head and a tight-lipped

smile. “Good fun, eh? See you next ’

week then.”

Over the little ridge in the far
corner of the ﬁeld, along the trail
which had marked the last stretch of
the day’s journey, a crowd of
hunters was starting to gather. A
man on horseback galloped up, out
of breath.

“A lady hurt back there, Mr.
Ayer. She didn’t make it over the

' last fence. Horse must have tripped

and then landed right on top of her.
Looks like a broken rib.”

The Master of Foxhounds put a
grim look on his face, nodded, and
the man rode back. But the news
didn’t stop Mr. Ayer from
performing his duties—he contin-
ued to toss chunks of horsemeat to
the happy hounds, and made the
proper goodbyes as hunters contin-
ued to leave. “Thanks for coming
by. Super day, wasn't it?”

The large bucket of meat ﬁnally
ran out. The hounds lay with
bloated bellies to the ground, legs
sprawled behind them like frogs.‘
Mr. Ayer mounted his horse.

INFORMATION MEETING:

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Pitt News Staff writer

Over 1,300 Pitt freshmen paid an
$8 fee to have a health risk profile
drawn up from an intensive study of
their personal and family health
histories—and have failed to pick
up the results, according to health
educator Bob LaCivita of Pitt’s
Student Health Service.

All incoming students have the
option of ﬁlling out a questionnaire
covering the spectrum of their
health history. The information is
fed into a computer programmed
with the 1974 Geller tables ‘
(statistics of the leading causes of
death) which compute the student's
risk age——a measure of the average
risk of death per 100,000 persons,
given the conditions specified in the
form.

Factors that may offer the
greatest reduction in life expec-

tancy include drinking, smoking
and certain forms of exercise.

 \ Sur[)ey$ Profile 

on how students could obtain proﬁle
results, most applicants are without

Family statistics, such as histories
of heart disease or cancer, as well as
suicide, also inﬂuence life expec-
tancy.

“The leading cause of death in
college-age students is accidents
involving motor vehicles,” LaCivita
said. “If a student drinks while
driving, or doesn’t wear a safety
belt, it lessens his chances for a long
life in these surveys. Alcohol and
suicides have a direct connection to
motor vehicle accidents.”

According to LaCivita, the Pitt
surveys did not reveal any
significant problems.

“We look at this more as a tool to
incite student interest in personal
health care,” LaCivita explained.
The amount of requests for the
surveys reflects this interest, he
said, but due to unclear directions

their risk proﬁles.

“Since they paid for them, they
deserve to get them,” LaCivita
said.

The results are highly conﬁ-
dential, LaCivita stressed, and
students who pick their results up at
the Health Education office in
Holland Hall (Saturdays from 1-5)
are given a package of pamphlets
dealing with various health prob-
lems and a clear explanation of their
results by either LaCivita or trained
members of the Peer Medical Aide
program. ‘

Besides surveying the student’s
current health, the profile gives his
prospective health at age 40, if that
he retains the same habits (amount
of smoking, drinking and activities)
he had at 20.

“Jeff, Louise,” he said, “I believe
I’ll hack back (‘ride my horse

would you. They were marvellous
today.”

In the distance, a group of pink
and blue jacketed men and women
carefully loaded the injured hunt-

'tress onto a stretcher. Mr. Ayer

whistled a merry tune and trotted
off back to his stable.

The hounds, meanwhile, mus-
cled, nipped, and threw ungentle-

_manly jabs with their hind legs in a

mad scramble to crowd into the
back of the pickup.

“They were really very good
today,” Jeff’s wife said, putting

Bailiff in a loving headlock before

she closed the gate. “We’ll have to

MIAMI-—-The C.J. Fox signature-
found on portraits of John F.
Kennedy and other celebrities-—is
a mark of prestige in some circles.
But the man known as Fox says it is
a phony.

A federal tax court here is trying
to determine who painted the
portraits—an art dealer who says
he has no qualifications as an
artist, or an 81-year-old man in a
Manhattan apartment.

The dealer is Leo Fox of Miami
and Long Island, N.Y. He startled
the court Monday by claiming that
“C.J. Fox” was not a fashionable
artist but only a corporation.

the Internal Revenue Service wants
to collect $40,000 in “personal

-says he doesn’t owe it because he
and his wife, Janice, operate as a
corporation, Charles J. Fox Inc.,
and pay at a lower rate. \

Judge Samuel B. Sterritt took the
matter under advisement following
a one-day hearing Monday. He said
there would be no ruling for several
days.

The IRS concedes that Fox

paid him as much as $7,000. But
the tax agents contend that Fox did
at least some of the paintings
himself.

Fox says the real artist is Irving
Resnikoff, who has never met any
of the subjects but paints them
from photographs. In his affidavit,
Fox said Resnikoff did 31 portraits
for him in 1972, 58in 1973 and 50in
1974.

In court, Fox swore he “does not
have the artistic qualiﬁcations and
training necessary to do the
sketches or portraits.”

Taylor Company Exciting

By PAT LAW
and SALLY RAPPEPORT

Paul Taylor, the famous modern
dance choreographer, brought his
company to Pittsburgh last Wed-
nesday night for an exciting evening
of dance. Wednesday’s program
included pieces ranging from
Taylor's earliest works to his most
recent, providing an overview of his
choreographic development.

The most unusual and interesting
‘piece in the performance was “3
Epitaphs.” The dancers were
completely covered in stocking-like
costumes designedgby Robert
Rauschenberg. These outfits
dissolved all individuality, giving
the dancers an inhuman appear-
ance. They shufﬂed through a
variety of amusing passages set to

Arts

folk music typical of pre-jazz

country brass bands.

“Aureo1e” and “Cloven King-
dom, ” the first and last pieces of the
program, were contrasting num-
bers. “Aureole,” set to exerpts
from Handel concertos, captured
the quality of a balletic suite.
“Cloven Kingdom” incorporated a
similar idea with added internal
contrasts. Electronic music was
layered on top of concerto music
while the movement paralleled this
musical contradiction.

cellent.

Julia. Squirrel Hill. True stroy of
playwright Lillian Hellman’s friendship

Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave star.
Very Good.

“Polaris” was the only piece that
used something other than an
empty stage as setting. It took part
in and around a large wood-framed
cube, about 10 feet by 10 feet. The
dance was in two parts, the second
being a choreographic replica of the
ﬁrst. The distinction between the
two parts was a change of cast,
music and lighting. Although this
idea of repeating movements with a
different cast is interesting, the
contrast wasn’t strong enough to
make a statement.

Other ‘than their technical
virtuosity, the Paul Taylor dancers
demonstrated an ease with per-
forming that made them a pleasure
to watch. The Paul Taylor Dance
Company provided Pittsburgh with
a rare chance to see fine
choreography and dancing.

A member of the Paul Taylor Dance Company displays a trademark leap.

 Panthers Pressed Into D

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL

Pitt News Staff Writer
AMHERST, Mass.—It took
Larry Harris just under four

minutes to pour his record-
establishing four points through
the nets here Monday night, but it
took Massachusetts fans even less
time to rip down those same nets
after their Minutemen had cut
down the Panthers’ hopes of
salvaging their road trip, 71-68, at
Curry Hicks Cage.

Massachusetts (15-11), which
ended its Eastern Eight schedule

%tied with Duquesne and Pitt at 5-5,

had only two leads against the
Panthers. The ﬁrst was 4-2; that
didn’t bother Pitt coach Tim
Grgurich or his team, since the
Panthers had a nine-point lead--
and Harris owned 18-—at the half.

The last Massachusetts lead, the
one that gave Pitt a 15-10 record,
was the result of a four-minute
period that was as bitter to the

Panthers as the first four minutes-

had been sweet for Harris. Pitt’s
last score came with 4:21 remain-
ing in the game, a situation
attributable to an incredibly effec-

poﬂs

tive Minuteman p. ess and to a rash
of severe Panther errors.

Pitt’s lead through the game’s
middle 35 minutes moved freely
between one and 11 points. The
Panthers seemed ready to take the
lead higher than 11 points several
times, but the Minutemen drew
closer than four points with equal

frequency.
More often than not, a
Massachusetts lead was based

almost wholly on a full-court press
that drove Pitt to desperation and
turnovers in equal amounts.

The Panthers spent uncomfort-
ably long stretches of time during
which only those Pitt players who
didn’t have the ball crossed the
halfcourt line. When they did get
close enough to the basket to see
that it still was there, the Panthers,
apparently surprised out of their
wits, began to do strange things.

Layups became low-percentage
shots; a pass became something
one did when pressed into a corner
by three defenders at a time when
the referees’ ﬁve-second call had
run out of ﬁngers.

“We were inconsistent,” said
Grgurich after the game. “We just
seemed to make crucial mistakes
late in the game.”

Monday’s last ﬁve minutes were
more than enough to bring back
memories of Cincinnati, George
Washington and Temple, teams
that had beaten Pitt only after
allowing the Panthers to become
conﬁdent in the lead. That list does
not include Penn State and Morris
Harvey, teams whose victories in
Pittsburgh were inexplicable. The
number of numbing defeats with
Massachusetts, has reached six,
and if Alka-Seltzer were able to
inﬂict on the masses what those

losses did to Grgurich, the national
anthem would be plop-plop-ﬁzz-
ﬁzz.

Pitt, after a missed free throw by
leading U. Mass scorer Mike Pyatt,
held a one-point lead and the ball
with two minutes to play. At this
point, Pitt already had twice
missed easy shots that threatened
to make Pitt’s two-point lead
insurmountable.

The Panthers, having broken the
press, went into a four-corner
offense with Pete Strickland at the
helm and his teammates waiting
for a chance to make the
quick-breaking layup that would
win the game. Pitt’s chance came
quickly at 1:40, when Harris
worked for a layup. He missed,
Clancy and Scheuermann com-
bined to give Pitt the ball, and the
Panthers called time.

Grgurich sent Bob Haygood into
the game, and the senior guard
added a measure of zip to the
sluggish Pitt attack. Strickland also
was on theﬂoor, but the man who
was dribbling the ball for Pitt with
not much more than a minute
remaining was Harris. ‘ In fact,
Harris did such a good job of
controlling the ball that the referee
cited him for controlling the ball
longer than the ﬁve-second rule
allowed. At 1:04, Harris (6-7) had
to jump against Eric Williams (6-5).

Harris had to jump, but he
didn’t. “It looked like a bad toss up
to me,” said Grgurich, “but that’s
no excuse. Larry wasn’t alert. He
didn’t jump.”

Williams tapped the ball to a
teammate, and Pitt went into a
zone defense. With 35 seconds
remaining, Pyatt drove and let ﬂy a
short shot that didn’t fall. The
reason it didn’t fall, according to a
referee, was that Sam Clancy’s
hand had violated the ball’s sacred
path to the basket. Massachusetts
had the lead, 69-68, and Pitt was
fading with terminal velocity.

Pitt’s last chance to win was
batted away with an Ed
Scheuermann pass that, via a
couple of Minutemen on a break,
led to Derick Claiborne’s layup at
the buzzer. “

“This was an important road
trip,” said Grgurich, whose losses
at Rutgers and Massachusetts put

him in command of a ‘team now
solidly a member of the Eastern
Eight standings’ bunched middle.
“But we played like a satisﬁed
ballclub. We were a poor passing
team both games.

“We must have missed ﬁve
layups in the last ﬁve minutes
tonight,” he continued. “And
when it came down to us having the
ball in the last few seconds, we
threw a bad pass...but that was

nothing new.’ ’

Kocha-An lnider’s ew of Pitt Basketball

By PAUL KOCHKA

  1 Editor’: note: Paul Kochka is a member

of the Pitt basketball team who has been
redshlrted becauseofalmee Injury.

As the last balls are slammed through the
hoop, as the last jumpers float sweetly
through the cords and as the hollow sound of
an empty ﬁeldhouse closes in on me, I reflect
back on a season. A season that seemed
much too long in October, but now is really
much too short.

When practice first started, I was ready. I

, had labored for two years on junior varsity
‘ ,; teams and as a benchwarmer. All summer I

worked on every aspect of my game, and this

would be the year I would ﬁnally contribute ‘

on the court. It lasted for three days, and a
previously injured knee couldn't take it. All
that work lost, all the dreams popped. Well,
it was time to mope and feel sorry for myself.

Enter a man who would have none of it. A
man who showed me I could still be part of

c the program and contribute, even though I

wouldn't be playing. A man who cared more
about me as a human being, than a
basketball player. A man named Tim
Grgurich, who exempliﬁes what the Pitt

, basketball program is all about.

I  I came to Pitt as a walkon. expecting to be

confronted by a bunch of ‘ ‘cocky jocks” who
would laugh at the thought of me stepping

.1-‘-,.-err:

on the same court with them. Instead, I have
met a bunch of warm individuals who have
helped me in every way they can. The help
has not just come on the basketball court
either.

The coaches, players and administration
involved with the Pitt basketball program
are interested mainly in the individual as a
person, not as an athlete.

It is a class organization and that has a lot
to do with the character and values of all the
people involved with the program. As
always, with different people getting
together to form an organization, there will
be differences. Somehow, though, all the
people I’ve met who are involved with the
program have the same type of character.

It's hard to describe, but maybe M. J.
Kramer, our secretary, describes it best by
saying, ‘ ‘We’re all one big family here. ’ ’ I'll
let some of the family tell you what it's like.

I asked the question: What is the single
most important aspect of the Pitt basketball
program?

Scott-_Nedrow: “The way we are willing
to work together and help each other. This
type of atmosphere is advantageous to
developing team spirit and character.”

‘Mouse’ McCullough (equipment
manager): “The way the coaches and
players care about each others problems,
and try to help one another as much as
possible.”

..v¢ar(ld:1((I—o-¢"r-

Danny Landy (Junior transfer from
Allegheny Community College): “The
people. From the head coach to the last
person on the totem pole, everyone feels
they are contributing something that helps
in different ways.”

Dave Perrin (head trainer): “Unity...
The underlying theme that everyone

afﬁliated with the program  striving for -

success.”

Ron Tanksley (freshman walkon): ‘ ‘The
clear atmosphere of friendliness and respect
given to everyone involved in the program. ’ ’

Tom “Lefty” Booth (assistant coach):
“The people. It is very satisfying to work
with a group of people who become very
involved with each other and ‘help everyone
through the different problems that arise.”

Dave Underwood (sophomore walkon):
“The program is ﬁrst class, and it will
remain ﬁrst class because of the people
involved. Talent means nothing, a person
will ﬁt in only if he has the right attitude."

Larry Harris: “Unity. The
togetherness of the players has made our
team and season what they are up to this
point.”

Mike Shaffer (assistant coach): “The
blending of 20 different young people into a
family (not always happy), for a period of
years.”

M. J. Kramer (secretary): “The people
involved. . .attitude, talent and experience. ..
acceptance of, and caring for each other
individually, and as a total unit.”

.v:N.\6i\

. I could go on and on and ;ach person
involved would echo the same responses:
“Unity, togetherness, helping and caring.”
Besides Harris and Nedrow, I decided to
quote a few of the people who are rarelv. if
ever, noticed. There are many more.
Maybe they are the most important people
in the program. They work at something,

, not for the glory, or recognition, but because
they believe in it. Their satisfaction comes
from contributing to a program that stresses
the things they believe in, and they get to
watch and help a bunch of young kids
become men.

When a person leaves this program, all
that everyone here wants for him is to be
successful in life. Grgurich puts the things
we experience on the basketball court into
sort of a parallel with our lives. We learn to
accept the bad as well as the good. By
dealing with our hardships in athletics now,
we will be better prepared to handle diﬂicult
situations that arise later in life.

In times when the very foundation of
athletics is crumbling into rubble of big
business and money, I am glad to be
involved with a program that stresses the
things that athletics are all about. The
individual, and his success in life, come
before that abused obsession of winning.

Because of my knee injury, I will probably
never play basketball again, but, ifl do, and
ifl ever have a son who does, it will be for a
program like this one.

*-Pitt’s men gymnastics team

_ completed a/successful weekend of

competition’, defeating host East
Stroudsburg State, 184.85-183.15,
before going to West Chester to
capture a triangular meet against
West Chester and West Virginia.
The performance against East
Stroudsburg broke the team scofing
record by ﬁve-hundredths of a

' point.

than I was that day ” coach Frank
D’Amico said. “It was one of the

Cyndee Severyn’s Several Talents

By JOHN FINN
Pitt News Staff Writer

Beneath her blonde hair and wide
smile is a bright and articulate
college senior.

Her name is Cyndee Severyn, the
only senior member of Pitt’s
nationally-ranked women’s gym-
nastic team.

Severyn’s gymnastic career,
which has been dotted with
setbacks, ofﬁcially began eight
years ago, but she said her dancing
experience was actually the begin-
ning of her career.

“I began dancing and participa-
ting in acrobatics when I was nine, ’ ’
she said, ‘ ‘but I didn’t see any
future‘ in it. I saw a gymnastics meet
at Mt. Lebanon High School and fell

in love with the sport.”

Severyn was anxious to learn
more about gymnastics when she
encountered a setback that may

edge going into the ﬁnal event, the
high bars. Pitt’s ﬁrst two per-
formers had low scores, then Frank
Klein burst forth with an 8.2.

Keith Wipprecht followed with an
event-winning 8.8, backed up by
Doug Smith’s 8.0 and all-around
winner Allan Meyers’ 8.7 routine.
The best Warrior ﬁnisher was in
third place.

Because the meet was expected
to be so close, four judges were
present, two of which are national
card holders eligible to judge
national and international meets.

D’Amico said the judges were
“very respectable and very difﬁ-
cult.” He expressed some surprise
that the Pitt scores were so high.

have caused many other people to
give up. Her high school, Cannon
McMillan, had no gymnastics team
at the time, so she joined the
Jeanette Jay School of Gymnastics
in Pittsburgh. She practiced there
during the week and competed in
AAU meets on weekends.

Severyn was forced to ride a bus
to and from Pittsburgh every day,
but the travel and workouts didn’t
dent her enthusiasm. In fact, her
hard work paid off in her junior year
when she ﬁnished third in AAU
Eastern Regional Competition.

During her senior year, Severyn
encountered another setback—a
prolonged illness during regional
competition—that prevented her
from competing.

After high school, Severyn
headed to New England to attend
the University of Massachusetts,
one of the premier women’s

gymnastic schools.

The crowd that packed the
Zimbar Gym saw one of the closest
meets ever held there. While the
Panthers demonstrated ﬁnesse in
side horse and high bar, East
Stroudsburg showed strength in
ﬂoor exercise, vaulting and parallel
bars.

Conﬁdent of a win, D’Amico
believed the East Stroudsburg
coach and team attempted to
intimidate the spirits of the
Panthers. “We kept our cool,” he
said. “We were able to beat our
record under two ofthe best judges
in the East.”

D’Amico was especially proud of
some of the judges’ comments
concerning Pitt gymnastics. One

But a year of disappointments
and setbacks brought her back
home. Although Massachusetts
won the Eastern title that year,
Severyn wasn’t happy there.

“There were a number of reasons
why I decided to leave,” she said.
“The people seemed distant and
cold, the coach left the program and
I really wasn’t satisﬁed with my
major.” .

So Severyn packed her bags and
frustrations and wound up in
Pittsburgh, where her gymnastics
career began ﬁve years earlier.

“I chose Pitt because Mike Kelly
was an assistant coach there, and I
had worked with him many times in
the past,” she said. “Also, Pitt
offered the most diversiﬁed aca-
demic program of all the schools I
was considering.”

Severyn’s career was reborn at
Pitt, and she was able to participate
immediately’ since women don’t

judge stated that even if Pitt would
have been behind in points, they
shouldphave won the meet based
on technique and execution alone.
D’Amico, who stresses this aspect
in his coaching, added, ‘‘I’d like to
think that’s how we teach.”

Another judge said he was proud
to judge the meet since “it is meets
like these that promote the sport of
gymnastics. ’

Pitt followed up their win at East
Stroudsburg by winning a triangu-
lar meet at West Chester, scoring
174 to West Chester’s 169.7 and
WVU’s 165.2.

“The whole trip was a super
success,” D’Amico said. “We took
the lead after the side horse and

( Gymnasts Sweep Weekend Series, Break Record

held on throughout the meet. We
only had a one and a half point lead,
going into the high bar, but the
blitzing team (the high bar team)
came through.”

D’Amico is shooting for a third
place at Regionals, which will be
held March 24-25. Since the team is
only losing one senior, D’Amico is
looking forward to an outstanding
season next year.

“Recruiting is looking optimal,
and we’ve got all the makings for
more depth,” D’Amico said.

According to D’Amico, scoring

200 points designates a team as .

good, and he believes Pitt can attain
200 points next season.

have to sit out a year after
transferring.

Severyn competed for the next
two years as a top performer in the
all-around, which includes the
balance beam, vaulting, floor
exercises and the uneven parallel
bars.

“My strongest of the four is the
ﬂoor exercise probably because of
my dance background,” she said.

This year, however, Severyn
suffered another setback. Pitt
realized an outstanding recruiting
year, copping two freshmen who
unseated Severyn. However,
Cyndee does not consider it a
setback.

“The backup position is very
important to the team,” she said.
“You have to be ready to move into
the top spot at any time.”

Despite competing only third or
fourth in her event, Severyn doesn’t
believe her hard work is all in vain.

Pantherettes Win Fifth in Row, A wait EAIA W

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

After closing out its dual-meet
season with ﬁve straight wins, Pitt’s
women swim team /will now
compete in the Eastern Association
of Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women Regional Championships at
Penn State March 2-4.

With the exception of the 100-
and 200-yard backstroke, the
Pantherettes (5-4) will have at least
two swimmers entered in every
event when the meet begins
tomorrow.

“This year, the girls are "really
psyched,” Pantherette swim coach.

,V Kate Matheson said. “They didn’t

do as well as they thought they
would during the ﬁrst part of the
season (Pitt lost its ﬁrst four meets.)
I have a feeling they want to make
up for the way they did then.”
Princeton and Penn State, two of

the teams that defeated the
Pantherettes during their early-
season slump, along with the
Pantherettes, should challenge
favored Rutgers for the team
championship, according to Mathe-
son.

‘ ‘We’ll probably be in the top four
with Rutgers, Penn State and
Princeton,” Matheson said. “Al-
thoughvl can't see anyone beating
Rutgers, lthink there will be a lot of
competition for the next three spots.

“Our girls don’t want Penn State
and Princeton ﬁnishing ahead of
them after what happened earlier
this season. It should be pretty
interesting to_ see what happens.”

According to Matheson, the only
thing keeping the Pantherettes
from a legitimate shot at the team
title is their weakness in the
backstroke.

travelling east; it was, it seemed,
peaking as it flew off in search of a
league title.

A pair of losses has done much to
take the Panthers’ heads out of the
clouds and drop them into a large
bucket of very cold water. They
have until tomorrow to recover, as
the Eastern Eight tournament is
one-loss-and-you're-out. (Pitt will
play George Washington at 9 p.m.)

“It’s an almost impossible
situation for us,” Grgurich said.
“This has taken away almost all of
our momentum. We don’t know
how to play down the stretch.”

Grgurich, as of today, has
approximately 36 hours to ﬁgure
why the above statement is true
and how to prove it false tomorrow
night.

PANTHER NOTES: Harris

Pulley has qualiﬁed to swim in both
the 100- and 200-yard backstroke,
she won’t be competing in either
event at Penn State because she’s
scheduled to swim in ﬁve other
events, the maximum number in
which any swimmer can compete.

“We don’t have any depth in the
backstroke at all,” Matheson said.
“It’s a problem that’s been
bothering us all season. In fact, I’d
say we were one backstroker away
from an undefeated season.

“You really can’t expect to win
the team title if you don’t have
depth in every event. Rutgers does
and that’s why they should win i ,”
Matheson said.

With all-America Kathy Stetler
swimming in the 50-, 100- and
200-yard freestyle, and 50- and
100-yard butterﬂy, Pitt is expected
to do well in these events. Matheson
also expects strong showings from

In the relays, Matheson expects

. big things from‘ the 400-yard

(Christy Elston, Patty'Davis, Pulley
and Stetler) and 800-yard (Jamie
Conley, Elston, Sue Dowd and
DeJesus) freestyle teams.

The meet is the last one in which
swimmers who haven’t previously
qualiﬁed for the nationals can
qualify.

So far, only Stetler (50-, 100- and
200-yard freestyle and 50- and
100-yard butterﬂy) and the 800-yard
freestyle relay team have qualiﬁed
for Pitt.

The meet continues through
Saturday; preliminaries in all
events are held in the morning with
ﬁnals scheduled for the same
evening as the preliminaries. The
top 12 ﬁnishers in the preliminaries
qualify for the ﬁnals.

“I’ve met so many great people,
I’ve gained a great deal of
self-discipline, I’ve been able to
stay in good physical shape and I’ve
grown especially close to the people
on the team,” she said. “What
more can I ask?”

Her coach, Donna DeMarino,
said Severyn remains an integral
part of Pitt’s success.

‘ ‘Cyndee is a ﬁne performer, and
she has contributed a lot to the team
through her leadership,” she said.

Severyn maintains many outside
interests. “When practice is over, I
try to disassociate myself from
gymnastics. Ilike to ice skate, play
raquetball and I am also interested
in breeding and showing dogs.

‘ ‘I have a lot of goals in life, “but I
couldn’t imagine my life without
gymnastics.” I hope to coach
someday.”

The Pitt bowling team avenged
an earlier season loss Monday by
beating the Community College of
Beaver County two out of three
games at Strand Lanes. *

The Panthers won the ﬁrst game,
808-760, paced by Kevin Fleisc-
hood’s 180 and Todd Miller’s 173.
 Mike Manje,rov_ic led Pitt the
second game with a 232, but it was
not enough to offset Beaver’s Jerry
Foreman, who shot a 261 to lead
the Titans to their 927-821 win.

Again led by Manjerovic, the
Panthers took the third game,
801-791, thereby giving them their
4-3 victory.

The Panthers bowled below their
season’s average, throwing 815 a.
game.

Captain Geoff Joseph said, “We
haven’t bowled since the tourna-_
ment in Beaver County a coupler‘ }
weeks ago, and that’s why we Wé1.,;§'
a little off. After some practice this
week, we’ll be ready on Saturday
for Washington and Jefferson.”

Manjerovic’s 583 was high series
for both teams.

Rape.

According to the Unifonn Crime
Report and the F.B.l. between 30,950
and 123,800 women will be raped in
Pennsylvania in 1978.

For women in this society, rape is a
fact of life. Women have to worry about
walking home alone at night, studying

late in a nearly empty library and the
type of security locks on their doors.

the possibility of being raped, and take

Rape Victim : Terror to Anger  

Editor_’s Note: The following essay first appeared
in the Sept.-Oct. issue of The Allegheny Feminist.

By Jan Hardy

I was raped.

For three years, I've denied myself
my anger. My story is the kind that
parents, boyfriends, husbands and
policemen warn women about—l was
walking in a park with a female friend at
night. I couldn’t protest the rape
because I wasn’t supposed to be in that
situation anyway. It was dangerous and
I was “asking for it."

Then I read of rape cases that took
place in the victim's own home. I read
that in most cases the rapist is not a
stranger, but an acquaintance, a trusted
friend of the family, even a relative or a
lover. I read of cases when the victim
couldn't have been "asking for it"—she
was an eight-year-old girl, or a 70-year-
old woman. I met one victim whose arm
and legs had been crippled and twisted
by polio in childhood. Hardly the typical
image of the provocative woman.

It became clearer to me that women
do not ask to be raped. Women fear
rape, and despite what Freud (and por-

nography) told you about masochistic

women, no healthy woman enjoys being
afraid or getting hurt.

I realized that If women want to be
out at night, we must carry this fear with
us, just as we carry our lighted cigar-
ettes, keys spoking from our fists,
lemon-juice spray and all the other near-
ridiculous substitutes for power in this
society.

Before I understood these things
about rape, I found myself joking sar-
castically about my experience. Watch-
ing other victims joking in this way, I
realized the reasons. First of all,
laughing is a good way to relieve the in-
credible burden of tension and fear.
Crying is preferable, but jokes are less
of a drag on the ‘conversation. Second-
ly, sarcasm is a passive form of anger,
usually unconscious anger at our own
helplessness. My friend also was
raped, and she reacted with, “Well,
that's life in the big city,” as though rape
is something to expect, like smog.

 

sexual crime. It was a crime of violence,
and I am not ashamed.

Another reason I couldn’t get angry
was that my friend and I were held at
gunpoint, and the emotion I remember
was pure terror. I could only think in
scattered images of my death and my
friends: my body, face unrecognizable;
her white jacket, red; policemen finding
us; friends hearing the news; I wouldn't
hear or see again; woulz I hear the shot;
I don't want to die; I don't want her to
die.

Even now I have trouble remem-
bering that night. I remember that the
man came toward us suddenly in a
wooded section and pointed the gun at
If- ense or escape was im

  

mouth, so I just wouldn't be able to
swallow or talk anymore.

I kept my hands on the ground
beside me to avoid touching him, to
show I had no weapon and to touch the
earth, for the last time I thought. My
friend sympathetically said that she put
one hand on his arm, and “his arm
muscles softened for just an instant.” I

‘understand that fear produces strange

reactions, and I know she acted on the
myth that'he just needed love. Still, you
don't get love by holding a gun to
someone’s head. He wanted to
humiliate and overpower us, not to
make love to us.

‘Reporting the rape was a second
assault, even though the police and

  

coats; when we caught glimpses of him,
he had a dark scarf over his nead and
face. We could only describe his
height, weight, posture and voice.
Later, an officer from the youth and sex

squad pushed us into identifying-

someone, anyone, from the mug shots
I finally picked one just to stop his in-
terrogation.

The police apologized for the per-
sistent, exacting questions, and they
phrased the questions delicately. Even
so, I wanted nothing to do with any men
an hour after being raped. Why couldn’t
a woman have asked for the report?

We were asked only once why we
were out at night, but that once was too
much. Another case of the victims
being made the criminals. Why not ask
the rapist why he was out that night?

At the hospital, again, I didn't want to
be near a man, much less have him
probe my vagina while I had to lie
passively. Of course, the gynecological
exam was necessary, but, like the
police questioning, a woman could have
done it. I knew what to expect, but the

doctor didn't explain his procedures or,

ask if I had had a pelvic examination
before. In fact, he was totally silent. I
became an object under his scrutiny.

At one point, he approached me with
a pair of long, sharp scissors. Startled, I
asked what he was doing. From the
nurse's vague, cheery reply, I gathered
that he was taking samples of pubic hair
for evidence to identify the rapist.
Imagine this incident with a victim who
had been held at knifepoint. '

It seems painfully clear that, to a vic-
tim, even a routine gynecological exam
can re-create the physical aspects of
her rape. When a male doctor, however
unintentionally, neglects to give her in-
formation about her own body, he puts
her through a mental rape as well.

Now that I can finally talk about my
rape, I find more and more political
reasons to share my ‘‘personal'’ ex-
periences. Many women I've talked to
have had some kind of unwanted sexual
assault, from an oppressive “seduction”

‘‘I realized that if women want to be out at night, we must carry this fear with us,

just as we can'y our lighted cigarettes, keys spoking from our fists, lemon-juice spray

and all the other near-ridiculous substitutes for power in this society.”

During the past three years, I only
told a few supportive friends about the
rape, and I felt it as a plea for sympathy.

that kept me from discussing the rape

The psychological scars resulting
fromrape usually preface a nightmare
for the victim when she attempts to
prosecute the rapist. Rape laws in
many states force the victim to stand
trial for the rapist's transgression again-
st her physical integiry, and so, require
revision.

Often, in court, past sexual history
evidence is flaunted out of context to
prove the victim’s alleged promiscuity
provoked the attack. This can
discourage her from reporting the
crime for fear her virtue will be publicly
scrutinized. If she prosecutes, the laws
demand corroborating evidence that
she resisted attack. Sometimes a
woman must be mutilated in order to
convince a jury she resisted. Moreover,
these laws are inconsistent from state
to state.

But even amendment of Federal and
state corroboration and past sexual
history rules in the form of shield laws
which ban such evidence is not enough.
Flape must be Federally redefined as an
assault against a woman’s general rights
rather than her genitals, getting a moral
guideline for state governments to
emulate.

By definition, rape is a violation of
female sex organs, an undeniable act of
violence and aggression treated as a
special case of either assault, coercion
or sexual abuse. In essence, rape is a
redundant legal concept, a special
illegal act, already deemed illegal by

' existing laws.

Cecil Barin and Ian Couchman, in
Society Magazine, July 1976, said the
definition of rape should be broadened
to include a spectrum of sexual abuses
and denigrations. Assault is a violation
of the entire body. Coercion is a
violation of personal rights. Sexual
abuse shelters both males and females
from sexual attacks excluding coitus.
Prosecution of rape as assault, coer-
cion or sexual abuse would help rectify
an attitudinal bias that shames the vic-
tim, not the criminal.

The Pitt News, and a writing major.

Raped Woman As Criminal

COMMENTARY

The historical picture of rape is an
exclusive assault against the female
genitals and, more inappropriately, a
trespass against the “man who owns
them.” Susan Brownmiller, author of
“Against Our Will,” dates rape to
humanity's earliest years, when men
needed labor power to cultivate the soil,
This, she says, led to the rape of
women to propagate farm-hands, and
later to the enslavement of conquered
men.

Despite the absence of an economic,
albeit unscrupulous, justification,
today's male—written rape laws still treat
rape not as a violation of personal
territory, not as an insult and denigration
of humanity, but as a trespass of one
man's property and one man's right to
control vaginal access, and ultimately as
an act of unlawful possession.

Changing the legal perception of
rape cannot guarantee the enlighten-
ment of any society imbued with
restrictive values. But shifting the law’s
focus from genitals to general rights
may set a better example for society, a
moral guideline promulgating a woman’s

humanness. Most importantly, when
the community regards rape, perhaps

as Brownmiller said, as a crime halfway
between robbery and assault, victims
who now fear pervasive public scorn will
seek judicial vengeance.

While the legal view of rape demeans
victims, current court procedures
shame them. The defense’s use of
sexual reputation evidence to prove the
victim’s “loose moral character"
discourages women from reporting
rape. Such a system, which stumps
judicial pursuance of a crime, is itself
inherently criminal. -

As long ago as Jan. 29, 1973,
Newsweekmagazine reported “rape is
emerging as the most widely committed
and generally unreported crime in the
nation." At that time, the F .B.l. reported
85 in every 100,000 females in major
cities are victims of forcible rape and
estimated 75 percent of all sexual at-
tacks on women go entirely unreported
to authorities. By 1976, the Uniform
Crime Fiports indicated only 33 percent
of all rapes were being reported-an
inadequate percentage to thwart repeat
offenses.

Even if the crime reaches court,
inordinate corroboration requirements
hinder conviction in even the most

violent rapes. Sometimes the jury
requires visible evidence of resis-
tance—knife cuts, burises, mutilated
limbs and genitals—before they will
acknowledge the attack was forced, not
provoked. Without exception, when
there are no prosecution witnesses, the
victim’s word she resisted rape is unac-
ceptable evidence. Unfortunately, most
rapes occur unwitnessed, and juries fail
to understand even the threat of violen-
ce may terrorize the victim to sub-
mission.

A 1972 Department of Justice vic-
timization study shows such threats oc-
cur in a substantial number of rapes and
indicates women will submit to attack if
they believe they can escape physical
torture by doing so. For exmple, it
reported the following use of weapons
by offenders in one-third of 700 Pitts-
burgh rapes: one-half used knives, 13
percent used firearms and 27 percent
used other weapons.

The same study indicates women ac-
tively resisting rape usually resort to
non-violent means. Of those females
who tried to protect themselves none
used a firearm or knife, 39 percent used
physical force or other weapons, 17
i ercent tried to get help of frighten the
offender, 14 percent threatened or
reasoned with their assailant and 29
percent used nonviolent resistance, in-
cluding evasion.

The harm of excessive corroborating
evidence is multiplied in states that
declare secondary charges—assault,
illegal possession of a firearm, van-
da|ism—accessories to the rape and
ignore them if the rape is cleared. But
the coup de grace of this impropriety

comes, if as an afterthought, the rapist '

steals the woman’s television for a
souvenir of the occasion. Then, he can
be prosecuted for robbery and serve no
time for rape. ,

tim as well as the rapist.

chances for this lie in passivity.

Editor ’s Note: Information for the following article is based on “Test. Your Rape I. Q, ” a pamphlet

published by Pittsburgh Action Against Rape.

Rape is surrounded by myths which frequently place equal blame with the vic-

‘Myth One: A woman can't be raped if she dce.sn’t want to be.

Physical force is used in 85 percent of all rapes. One-fourth of the time the
rapist is armed with a dangerous weapon.

WHile overwhelming evidence has shown that women who fight back or
scream stand a better chance of warding off the attacker, the victim’s main con-.
cern is to survive her ordeal with minimal abuse. She may feel that her best

Myth Two: Most rapes happen late at night on deserted streets.

Actually, most rapes happen in the home of the victim, and an almost equal
number occur in the residence of the rapist.

While it is a good idea not to walk alone in deserted areas, few rapes happen
this way. Most rapists are at least acquaintences of the victim and rape is rarely
and actoccurring at random. The rapist usually has carefully thought-out plans.

Myth Three: False reports of rape are extremely high.

The rate of false reports if four to five percent of rape reports—about the same
rate for other violent crimes. in fact the FBI estimates that only one rape in 20 is

reported.

Myth Four: Most rapists are black and their victims are white.

For reported rapes, 93 percent take placebetween people of the same race.
Myth Five: Rapists are perverts devoid of sexual outlets.

There is no difference between the typical rapist and any other man, except

the rapist has a greater tendency to express anger through violence.
Sixty percent of all convicted rapists are married men with normal sex lives.

Myth Six: She asked for it.

Rape victims can beany one of any age with any type of appearance. The
age of rape victims has ranged from four months to 89 years, and it is hard to
imagine an instance of an infant or grandmother acting suggestive.

Myth Seven: The primary motive for rape is sexual.

Rape involves coitus, but it is not sexual. Rape is an act of violent aggression,
motivated by the desire to abuse, humiliate and degrade women.

, Women Fight Back , Victims No More

By A ngele Ellis

Rape, like death, often is seen as
something that happens to other
people. College women, many living
and traveling on their own for the first
time, tend to ignore the possibility of
rape with naive bravado, and often leave
themselves vulnerable to attack.

Women do not have to be vulnerable,
because there are common-sense
procedures to follow that can prevent
attack and rape.

TRAVEL

Walking, driving or hitchhiking alone
is dangerous, especially at night; try to
travel on well-lighted, well-populated
roads rather than on deserted ones.

When walking, keep "to the curb,
away from buildings, trees and shrub-
bery; take note of the lighting, alleys,
abandoned buildings and people on the
street. it also is wise to vary regular
travel routes——many rapists study their
victims’ habits.

If being followed (check this by
looking back at regular intervals), or if a
suspicious man or men is ahead, cross
the street; either walk in the opposite
direction or walk with other people on
the street. Never answer men who try
to make_ conversation on the street, and
always walk briskly and confiden-
tly——looking lost increases the chance
of attack.

While driving, keep the car doors
locked and the windows rolled up to
admitonly a breathing space. Do not
drive with less than a quarter tank of

 

gas. If being followed, go to the nearest
police station, gas station, shopping
center or home with lights.

Never enter
checking to see if someone is hiding on
the rear seat or floor. If you find a man
(or men) leaning on your car, do not en-
ter it. When leaving a car in a parking
garage or lot, note its position so you
can return to it directly. If you see
anything suspicious when returning to
the car, tell the garage attendant.

Hitchhiking is a dangerous form of
travel, but if you must hitchhike, try to
accept rides only from women. if you
accept a ride from a man, do not get in if
there is more than one man in the car
(check the back seat to make sure).
Refuse a ride from a man who is
speeding, who looks or acts drunk or
drugged, or who makes a U-turn to pick
you up. ,

After accepting a ride, ask the driver
where he is going before you reveal
where you want to go. Keep one hand
on the car door handle; do not wear a
seat belt. If the driver refuses to let-you
out of the car, open the door and roll
out.

your car without i

when the driver drops you off, never
let him see where you are going; walk in
the opposite direction until he pulls
away.

APARTMENT LIVING

When moving into a new apartment,
change all locks on the outside doors,
install a chain lock (short enough to

- prevent removal from the outside, with

long, sturdy screws), and install a
peephole and window locks. Keep your
curtains and shades drawn at night, and
keep lights on in atleast two rooms".

When alone and answering your
apartment door, never reveal there is no
one else in the apartment. Say
something like, “l’l| get it, John,” before
going to the door. Never let a stranger
into your apartment; use the peephole
or safety chain to determine the per-
son's identity. Make men claiming to be
repainnen produce identification before
admitting them.

Insist that your landlord provide
adequate lighting in apartment hallways,
entrances, stairways and trash and
parking areas, and be wary in parking
areas, laundry rooms and elevators.

Never get on an elevator with a
suspicious man (or men); get off if such
a man enters the elevator. When en-
tering an elevator, stand next to the
control panel; allow other passengers to
push their floor buttons before pushing
yours. If you feel threatened, push the
elevator alarm button ‘and as many but-
tonsgas possible to stop the elevator.

When returning to your apartment’,
have your keys ready to use; do not

stand in the doorway and fumble for
them. Never let a stranger enter an
apartment security door with you—even
if you must slam the door in his face.

DEFENSE

The above precautions may not, un-
fortunately, prevent attack; a woman
may have to use physical means to
escape a rapist.

Screaming—loudly and persisten-
tly—is an effective defense tactic. Clear
calls of “Rape!" “Helpl” or even “Firel”
may scare off an attacker and bring
help. Hitting the rapist with objects

such as bottles and bricks or pencils, l

keys and shoes also may enable a
woman to escape. Lighted cigarettes
can also be used as weapons. Kicking a
rapist in a vulnerable area like the
kneecap is another useful defense tac-
tic.

Women interested in protecting
themselvescan leam to use their bodies
defensively. Two local organizations,

Karate Women and Feminist Karate_

Union teach women self-defense
techniques.

Resisting a rapist may result in being
hurt, but unless a rapist is armed, it is
advisable to resist. Reasoning with a
rapist also has prevented rape.
Statements such as “l have syphilis," ‘‘I
am pregnant and it will kill my baby” and
“You are hurting me" have been used
effectively.

but subject the victim to unnecessarily
humiliating cross-examination. Although
only a fraction of the nationwide in-
cidences of rape are prosecuted in
Federal court, a modification of Federal
statutes would establish a guidelne for
states that have yet to amend their rape
laws to follow.

Presently sitting the U.S. House of
Representatives Judiciary Committee
are two bills worthy of feminist support.
Neither proposal, however, is near con-
firmation, lacking substantive sym-
pathies from Congress.

The first proposes amendment to the
Federal Rules of Evidence to protect
the privacy of rape victims.
Representative Elizabeth Holtaman, D-
N.Y., sponsored the bill, which bans
“reputation or opinion evidence of a
person's past sexual behavior” in a trial
for alleged rape or assault with intent to
commit rape.

Unfortunately, the bill provides for
exception if the evidence is of past
sexual behavior with the accused to
establish consent, i.e., steady boy-
friends cannot be prosecuted for rape.
On the other hand, a strict interpretation
of the proposal would prohibit evidence
of previous intercourse with other men
even if the alleged victim had consen-
sual intercourse with several men at a
party prior to any interaction with the

ldefendent.

Several ambiguities in the rights of
both defense and prosecution in this
bill—which surfaced during hearings in
July 1976-—have stymied the bill's
progress.

The second bill, sponsored by Jerry
Patterson, D-Calif., proposes rape be
defined as sexual assault and provides
for gradations of sexual abuse, including
sexual contact without ‘penetration.

that a human being has an inalienable
right to physical integrity, as Barin and
Couchman suggested in their proposal
to abolish rape laws.

But even in the reforming of laws,
traditional attitudes of male ownership of
female sexual goods pervades. In
1975, during debate on refonning the
past sexual history evidence burden in
Arizona, the chairman of the Phoenix
40, a special task force on crime com-

prised of conservative businessmen.

said, “We’re sick and ‘ tired of our
women being raped.”

In this case “our women" was ap-
propriate because the Phoenix 40 is
male-populated and the Arizona
Legislature male-dominated.

Ben-Horin reported in Nation
magazine a state of hilarity over the
issue pervaded the Legislative session.
He continues, ‘‘It is the mood in which

the issue was considered which makes

revision may be deriving a significant
portion of its motivation from the same
sexual stereotyping that feminists have
long decried." Despite the legislators’
apparent amusement with the bill, it
came surpringly close to passage.

As long as women's demands for
legal equity induce snickers from the
legislative grandstand, reformation of
rape laws is not enough. Today's law
implies rape is a violation of “man’s”
property and an assault against some
community's effete moral code. But this
is displacing the real offense, which is
the insult, denigration and denial of
general rights. Rape should be
prosecuted as assault, coercion or
sexual abuse, according to the method
in which a woman chooses to define her
sexuality. This allows our society's
legal system to demonstrate its
democratic‘ values of concentrating on
women's rights rather than her genitals.
