Grant Offered

Pitt’s engineering department
received a $l50,000 grant to help
keep its students in schoolfrom
the Exxon Education Founda-
tion. '

The foundation, which is a
branch‘ of the Exxon Corpora-

lion to schools nationally in an
effort to help ease the shortage of
engineering teachers.

“It will help us build a strong
program and also help students
from being drafted by the indus-

tries," said Dr. Yatish Shah,
head of the Chemical Engineer-
ing Department. /
— He explained that $lO0,000 of
the grant will be used to support
juniors and untenured faculty in
the chemical engineering depart-
ment for five years. $50,00(‘)gwill
be used for scholarships for grad-
uate students, Shah said. The
grant will be implemented next
year.

College Censorship
(UPI) -— The student newspaper
at a small Roman Catholic col-
lege was distributed today—but
without an ad for abortions that
had irritated the college
administration.

The Minstrel, a four-page tab-
loid at Allentown College of St.
Francis DeSales, was reprinted
without an ad offering abortions
at a women’s center today after
‘editors bowed to administration
demands.

The editors published a state-
ment saying the ad was “inad-
vertently included in the paper”
on Friday.

The editors say they agreed to
allow the administration to cen-
sor the newspaper in order to
publish today’s edition.

The editors say they are
opposed to abortion, but main-
tain the issue is free speech, not
abortion.

The editors said they will not
publish another issue of The
Minstrel, scheduled to appear
about once a month, until the
question of editorial control is
resolved.

Man Killed
In Fall From

Cathedral  

By

An unidentified olive-skinned
male was killed last night when he
fell from an upper floor of the
Cathedral of Learning to an
enclosed courtyard at 7:l5. a

City and campus police have not
determined whether the incident were
a suicide or a homicide. ’

Both police departments said the
man was carrying no identification,

and they could not determine if he,

were a Pitt student.

Pittsburgh, Police_ Lt. Louis

Steckel said’. it was a “high-impact’ T

landing" because three stone tiles of
the closed courtyard were broken
and caved in, leaving debris behind “
the vending machines near .the
Burger Chef in the Cathedral
basement.
Steckel estimated that the man fell

from no l.ower than the lOth or l lth

ﬂoors.

A freshman attending a night
class on the third floor said she
didn't hear any sounds except a loud
thump. ‘

“It sounded like a door slam-t

Policeto ReviewEmergency Procedure

By NICK ARNETT
(Last of a 2-Part Series)

Part I. which appeared in Wed-
nesdays Pitt News,reported that a
six-minute delay by the campus
police in calling the fire department
during last Friday's $50,000 three-
alarm fire at the Faculty Club may
have resulted in needless damage.
The second part of the story was
delayed until today to allow univer-
sity officials an opportunity to
respond.

University Public Safety Director
William Tucker said he will review
campus police emergency proce-_
dures in response to reported delays
in passing emergency messages to
city services.

“I think that sufficient question
has been raised that I should review
our procedures,“Tucker said in an
interview yesterday. Although cam-
pus police said they received a call
concerning the Faculty Club fire at
6:l2 p.m.. the city fire department
dispatchers said they did not receive
a call until 6:l8 p.m.,when the cam-
pus police called the fire dispatchers.
Campus police Lt. Jim Watters said
such delays sometimes occur as uni-
versity police investigate the severity
of an emergency call.

City Fire Chief Charles Lewis
sharply criticized the procedure,
saying that the fire department
should always be called
immediately. ‘

Tucker said the six-minute figure
is ‘inaccurate, suggesting that the
campus police were unable to get the
message to the fire department dis-
patchers, for reasons he would not
specify.

“There are things l’m not fully
prepared to discuss at this time,” he
said. “I need to review this with my
subordinates and review the tapes
(of phone conversations regarding
the fire).”

Tucker said that delaying calls is
not a formal policy of the depart-
ment but may have become an infor-
mal procedure in some cases.

“As far as I know, ifthe (campus)

police officers would see that there
is any strong indication that there is
a fire, they would call the fire depart-
ment and send police to the scene,"
.Tucker said.

According to Watters, some
emergency medical calls are also
delayed while campus police officers
determine their severity.

Tucker said an initial determina-
tion is made by the police officer on

the phone with the complainant.
“The officer interviews (the
caller),” Tucker said. “Depending
on what he finds out, he makes a
determination as to what to send--
whether the city medics should be

called or not. When the person leads

the police to believe it’s a life--

threatening situation, the medics are
called."

Watters explained that when a
caller gives little information, such

Pitt Budget Uncertain

By SETH LUBOVE‘

State Budget Secretary Robert ,.

Wilburn, the loyal Republican that
he is, couldn‘t help putting in a plug
for President Reagan’s economic
policies during a recent discussion
about Pitt’s fiscal year I983 appro-
priations request to the state.

“We've gone through four years

without any real economic growth,
the first time since the '30s we’ve had
a four-year period without any real
economic growth. None. Zero,”
Wilburn said. “That was the impetus
of the election of the current
president---to attempt to do some-
thing different.” ,

However, as he is prone to do
when discussing Pitt's appropria-
tions request, Wilburn quickly qual-
ifies his statement with a note of
uncertainty:

“Whether it's going to work or

not, I don’t know. lf it does, if we
have some growth in the economy,
then we’ll be in a better position to
do things,“ he said. “If not, then
we’re going to continue to have
extremely tight budgets and a shar-
ing of the burden among all parties."

Translated into Pitt’s case, unless
the economy shapes up for the bet-
ter, students will be paying increas-
ingly higher tuition to compensate
for decreasing state support.

Pitt is asking the state for $85.5
million in appropriations for fiscal
year 1983. an increase of$lO.8 mil-
lion or l4;5 percent over the fiscal
year I982 appropriations. Included
in the appropriations request is a
five percent tuition increase. which
could go higher depending on what
the governor recommends to the
state legistature when he presents his
budget request in February.

TV Journalism: Not as Easy

By SCOTT SELTZ

“A career in television reporting
isn’t as easy as it looks" was the main
piece of advice that KDKA-TV’s
features reporter, John Buchin,
offered students at Pitt's l98l Busi-
ness, Industry, and Communica-
tions Seminar in the lobby of Forbes
Quad on Tuesday.

Buchin was on hand to advise and
answer questions from students con-
cerning the job possibilities. activi-
ties, and responsibilities of a career
in broadcast journalism. As Buchin
warned. “Television reporting
requires a great deal of hard work,
persistence and luck."

“Just breaking—in to television
news is difficult, due to the highly
competitive industry structure. TV
stations are ranked in relation to
viewing audience or market. Larger

market stations offer more prestige

for aspiring reporters, while the
smaller stations provide a training
ground. Although over 200 markets
exist nationwide, the availability of
entry level positions is limited.“
Buchin said.

Due to this structure, “most
reporters start their careers at small
stations where they practice their
craft by writing and producing news
assignments,” Buchin said. “How-
ever, not everybody will make it to
the top stations in New York, Chi-
cago or Los Angeles."

Buchin stressed that to land a
position in the news department ofa
station, “you have to badger the per-
son who does the hiring. People are
busy and dOn’t remember everyone
they talk to—-hopefully, by badger-
ing, they’ll remember you.”

News Directors, the people
responsible for hiring news person-
nel, look for “educationally well-

rounded individuals who possess
strong communication skills and

show great interest. motivation and
inquisitiveness towards reporting,"
Buchin said.

Buchin added that practical expe-
rience through internship programs
and part—time positions at TV sta-
tions are often the key to students
getting jobs‘ after graduation.

A political science and cOmmuni— ’

cations graduate from the Univer-

sity of Pennsylvania. Buchin has,

worked for over l7 television and
radio stations in the last ten years

before joining l(DKA‘s Eyewitness
News team six months ago.

The seminar was part of the
Career Seminar Series sponsored by
The University Counseling and Stu-
dent Development Center of Stu-
dent Affairs.

Man Killed In Fall From Cathedral

continued from page um‘

Public Affairs Louis Tronzo said he
has “no idea" if the man was a Pitt

' student.

According to Daryl Clemmens,
assistant director of public relations,
the man appeared to be “older than
the average undergraduate." '

The man was found wearing a

blue shirt, white pants and one white
tennis shoe. Another tennis shoe and
a hat were lying several feet from
where his body was found. He was
lying face down.

An autopsy was scheduled for this
morning. Both police departments
declined further comment until
more information was available.

 2 The Soul of a University

*2?

By scor STONE

“The university, as it once was.
has been put in lhepi/lory during the
last 10 years,' it will recover only I_'/.'

far from cmzstanl/_i' giving in to the

demands ofthe time, we succeeded
in legitirnizing its very nature to our
contemporaries. "
--—J_ohn Henry Newman.
founding rector of the Uni-
versity of Dublin. I854.

The university, by its very nature,
is constantly buffeted by pressures
from the outside world. From
within, the historical struggle
between fascination with the new
and the obligations of tradition has
produced a certain character that
distinguishes the modern university
of the West from those in the past,
and in other parts of the world.

At present, however, the demands
of the contemporary world are dam-
aging the university in that it is less
able to focus upon what was tradi-
tionally considered its properend.

In the particular case ofAmerican
universities, and specifically Pitt, the
national economic stagnation and
decline of the last l0 years, coupled
with the growth of centralization
and applied high technology in the
society at large, has resulted in a
conservative and fearful position for
the institution within the larger com-
munity.

But what exactly are the goals ofa
university, and what, specifically‘,
are those forces diverting it away
from its proper end?

Traditionally, the university is an
institutionalization ofseveral princi-
ples, the first of which is an unham-

John Chapman

University of Pittsburgh

"The Faculty ofArts and Sciences
is the core of any university. The
combination of the FAS with the
various professional schools is uni-
quely American. You don’t see that
kind of clustering in Europe. ln
France, if you want to become an
engineer, you go to the technical
school, not the university per se. _

“This arrangement is a distillation
of the American concept of the lib-
eral arts college and the German
concept ofthe graduate faculty. The
combination of research and teach-
ing is typically American, and, I
think, a useful organization of
resources. By exposing the student
to the very best within a certain field
of study, the student and the disci-
pline are better off for it. Ideally,
there is an active interplay between
the pure, the pratical and the applied
aspects of scholarship.

“What we see is a union of teach-
ing and the graduate faculty. The

operational ideal becomes the schol-

broad sense.

"The extremew-undergraduate
professional schools--is not likely
to be the way of the future. Most
things can be deferred until the post-
graduate level, although certain con-
siderations such as time and tuition
costs, make it attractiveto begin spe-
ciali/ing in business while still at the
undergraduate level.

“Our dual major program is an
attempt to work within the liberal
arts framework. it requires a student
to develop an understanding of
some aspect of the humanities or
social sciences.

“But the interaction of economic
pressures with students’ needs has a
strong effect on what actually
happens. in the ‘50s, when l was an
undergrad, an Associate in Business
Degree was considered quite ade-
quate, and there were so few of us at
the time that the atmosphere in the
job market was less fierce. That stra-
tegy was seriously called into ques-
tion when the job market tightened
up and the student demand for more
advanced‘ offerings combined with
the increasing professionalization of
the business world led to the increase
in M.B.A. programs.

“Yet, even when you look at Pitt’s
business faculty, you see a wide
array of undergraduate disciplines
represented.

“The primary value of the classic
liberal arts education is that it
teaches you to learn how to learn.
That fact makes me believe that
undergraduate liberal arts will
always prevail.”

ar—teacher. It would seem. et en from
an economic point of xiew. 10 b6
impossible to separate the two func-
tions within the same institution. the
cost would be astronomical.

"My worry is about the encour-
agement of early specialization
among students. Not, for example.
in the case of medical or law stu-
dents; in those cases. it is impossible
to get into school without deciding
on a course of study at the earliest
possible date, but to permit people
to do an undergraduate major in
business, say, is frightening.

“if you spend those years master-
ing what are essentially technical
skills, you fail to equip yourselfwith
the kind of general background
knowledge that gives you the capac-
ity to think about the larger issues in
life.

“if you consider that all of the
people who are in top positions in
the various sections of society-~
business, government, science-~—~
think about the whole picture,
rather than just a tiny portion of it,
then it becomes clear that by early
specialization, you condemn your-
self to eternal subordination within
the system.

“Essentially, you are equipping
yourself to become a perpetual cor-
poral.”

Andrew Blair

Associate Dean_
Graduate School of Business

University of Pittsburgh

“The emergence ofthe Masters ot
Business Administration program
is, in my opinion. a further extension
of the professional schools within
the university.

“Ofcourse, the number ofschools
offering the program has mush-
roomed. There is certainly a concern
about the possible adulteration of.
quality, but this growth is primarily,
a response to the market pheno-
menon. The university today has a
variety of clients. and the current
demand is coming strongly from the
business and professional corners.

“Yet I do feel strongly that the
universities must maintain the
essence of the liberal arts education,
and I think that lies in the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences.

“Because, in the advanced levels
of management, for instance, we
depend upon an understanding of
underlying principles, such as eco-
nomics and behavioral science
gathered from a variety of disci-
plines, it is very important that the
undergraduate be educated in a

The following crimes were
reported to the campus police dur-
ing the past two weeks.

0 On Sept. 14, a locked storage
cabinet was forced open on the ninth
ﬂoor of Schenley Hall. Money
belonging to the
Department was stolen.

0 Two youths allegedly’ stole a

niles were apprehended by plain-
clothes campus policemen in front
of Trees Hall. The tape player was
returned, and the juveniles were
placed in the custody of their par-
ents. According to Lt. Jim Watters

things other than the usual law

officers actions may save a life or
property. l‘d like to see more train-
ing in that respect.”

According to Watters, campus
police cars carry air packs that can
be used to rescue people from
smoke—filled buildings. All officers
are trained in first aid, he said. and
30 percent of them have taken the
81-hour Emergency Medical Tech-
nicians (EMT) training course. The
EMT course is the minimum train-
ing required for ambulance
attendants.

By comparison, city medics are
certified EMT-paramedics, who
must have at least two years oftrain—
ing before starting and must con-
tinue their education at
Presbyterian-University Hospital’s
Center for Emergency Medicine.

Tucker said he would also like to
work with the fire department in
decreasing the number of false
alarms at Pitt. He noted that the
problem “hasn’t been as bad as last
year, but I still believe the problem
needs attention.”

Budget

continued from page -one:

“One thing ‘is for certain," iWil-
burn said. “The governor sent ‘out a

directive to all state agencies asking j 
them to keep the increases" intheir O

budget requests ‘below six percent."

So what is Pitt doing asking the
state for a 14.5 percent increase in its
appropiatrions request? 

‘V‘_;lt doesn’t hurtto ask," Wilburn
said. i

“I’m sure that the officials at the
University of Pittsburgh feel that’s
what they need. And certainly no
one would fault them for presenting
their view. Whether or not they get it
is problematical. It depends on what
happens in the budget process," he
said.

Wilburn said the most important
issue he’ll have to contend with this
year in preparing the state’s budget
will be absorbing the changes occur-
ing on the federal level. “That’s
going to overshadow evcerything
elsef’ .

In its budget presentation to the
General Assembly last year,‘ Pitt
noted that its tuition rates were the
second highest in the nation for pub-
lic universities. Temple and Penn
State, also state-related, had the first
and third highest tuitions in the
country for public universities in fis-
cal ycar l98l.

Wilburn admitted that the high
tuition rates were alarming. but he
added that the state currently has
one ofthe “more generous assistance
programs in the country“ with the
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency (PHEAA).

"its good to be here once more.”

The music of Basie and the

Throughout the evening. the
musicians took turns playing
solos, much to the overwhelming
ap iroval of the audience.

During the concert’s brief
in ermission. ‘the 77-year-old
bandleader commented on the
types of audiences to which his
band’s music appeals.

“The audiences are getting
older~-and younger.” said Basie.

As each soloist stepped from
the bandstand to play a solo or
conduct the group on his particu-
lar arrangement ofa song, Basie
would introduce the musician
with a low. relaxed tone ofvoice.
He conducted the band through
most of the songs by using nods,
winks, or playing a simple set of
chords on the piano.

Opinion

Fooﬁng
Around

in the course of Pitt’s fiscal relations with the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania, it has been standard pol-
icy for the chancellor to ask for the optimal level of
appropriations funding. This year, Chancellor Wesley
Posvar went to Harrisburg with a request package that
included a 5 percent tuition hike in the aid equation.

This approach was first used by Penn State lastyear
when, according to Tom Lamb, Pitt’s director of
governmental relations, the move would hopefully
develop greater sympathy among legislators.

ltdid not work for Penn State last year, and it will
not work for Pitt this year. .

According to state Budget Secretary Robert Wil-
burn, it is highly unlikely that any state agency will
receive more than a 6 percent increase in appropria-
tions, and that in all likelihood, many programs will be
cut back.

Pitt -is currently asking the state“~for,$85.5 million for
fiscal l983. That is l4.5 percent more than what it
received for fiscal 1982. Pitt has never received all that
it has asked’ for from the state since it became state-
related. Simple arithmetic tells us that if Pitt is unsuc-
cessful in obtaining its optimal level of funding,
students will be paying an additional 12 to 20 percent
in tuition costs next September.

Wilburn characterized this strategy when he said,
“It doesn‘t hurt to ask.” ln fact, it does hurt to ask in
this way. i

The people who make the greatest effort to afford an
education-those who must work summer or part-
time jobs to raise tuition---are needlessly left hanging.

When asked what the student can expect in terms of
tuition hikes, the Pitt administration typically answers
with a variation on the “it’s all very sketchy now, and
we won’t have a solid answer until more facts come in”
theme. Yet all the facts appear to be in, at least to the
extent that significant tuition hikes are a near
certainty. '

Why is it that the university cannot include a warn-
ing in its appropriations request that lets the student
know that this is only a hoped-for goal, and that a
strong possibility exists that it cannot be met?

The student, along with the paying customer, has a
right to know what kind of price he can expect to pay
for a bill of goods. lt is a breach of faith on the part of
the university to fail to acknowledge more clearly the
likelihood of larger tuition hikes. We have accepted
this Charade for years, but with the rise in cost increas-

ing at every turn. our patience may be beginning to’

wear thin.

Stereotyping Semi- Literate Yahoos

By MARK COLLILNS

The popular concept of Evangeli-
cals paints them as enthusiastic but
semi-literate yahoos with their cen-
ter of gravity in the South. The con-
cept is outmoded and outdated—-as
is the term “popular concept” itself.

Numbers and statistics have
replaced the stereotype. Commenta-
tors plague us with “trends in reli-
gion” and “the re-awakening of
Evangelism” and on and on. Really,
Evangelicals have never left; really,
religion has always been there, and
the only thing recent is the discovery
of this fact. As with anything new.
analysts like to play with statistics
and figures. forecasting the religious
climate. Accuracy in predicting
something so mammoth and so mis-
understood is bound to fail.

L The truth,Aas usual. is a little less
exciting. Evangelicals cannot be
grouped easily. There are many
denominations, whose political
beliefs and styles differ substantially

Letters

from one another. In fact, thetheory
that political conservatism holds
sway with Evangelicals is a myth-
eonservatism is popular with many
folks these days, not all of whom are
Evangelicals. _

The most unfortunate conse-
quence of these misconceptions is
that they have been held by people at
both ends of the political spectrum.

Liberals are quick to point a liber-
ated finger at the Moral Majority for
most of society’s ills. Again, the
truth is less exciting. Conservatism
has no continuous allegiance. Tradi-
tionally, the South is conservative;
Traditionally, Protestants are con-
servative. But. like stereotypes be-
fore them, these perceptions might
be wrong, or might change dramati-
cally overnight. They have before.
Reagans’ perceived support among
conservative Protestants is brought
into question since blacks—mostly
poor--account for a full 25 percent
of the Evangelicals. Austere fiscal
policy often speaks louder than ste-

reo types.

On the other hand. Rev. Jerry
Falwell has often spoken eloquently
on behalf of reborn and evangelical
Christians, denying that they are
racist, anti-sematic, or ignorant.
Rev. Falwell runs into the same
problem that the liberals do: a group
so large cannot be spoken for with
one voice. The population of Evan-
gelicals is too large and too frag-
mented to have a strong consensus
of opinion on anything but
religion---and even that‘s risky.

What this group is, really, is a
large cut ofvthe country with some-
thing, but very little something, in
common. They cannot be catego-
rized except loosely, they cannot be
placed into trends or policies or
politics. they cannot even be spoken
for with authority.

We often try to fit people into
slots as a way of making sense of
things. But tryingto forceagroup so

Carolina Faces Pitt With 3 Options, No Rogers

Tackle Bill Fralic’s play against Carolina’s Andrew
Provence could dictate Pitt’s fate in tomorrow’s game.

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Due to one very notable gradua-
tion, the South Carolina Gamecock
offense has shelved the “I-
formation" this year for a triple-
option attack and a comparative
modicum of success. Given a fourth
option, Gamecock football coach
Jim Carlen might ask for George
Rogers’ return. By tomorrow.

Without Rogers, last year's Heis-
man Trophy-winning tailback,
Carolina’s offense has faltered at
times through its first four games
this season. Whether it’s been the
adjustment" to the triple—option, or
just the adjustment to life without
George, the defense has carried
Carolina to its 2-2 record going into
tomorrow’s regionally-televised
clash with Pitt. Game time is 3:50
p.m. at Williams-Brice Stadium in
Columbia, S.C.

“Our offense right now is going
through some tough times.” Carlen
said “Playing someone like Pitts-
burgh won’t help."

The problem with the offense,
according to Carlen, is consistency.
There is none.

The Gamecock coach has shuttled
two quarterbacks in and out of the
lineup the first four games.

So far neither of the players—-
junior Terry Bishop and Gordon
Beckham—has performed to
Carlen’s liking, although Beckham,
a quick 6-l, I85-pound junior, will
start against Pitt.

“We’ve tried everything. Both
have had difficulty being consis-

tent.” Carlen said. “(Horace) Smith.

our wide receiver, hasn’t been a fac-
tor. We haven’t gotten the ball to
him."

Smith, a senior. has averaged over
20 yards a catch during his career,
but he hasjust six catchesthis season
because the Gamecocks occasion-

ally have had trouble throwing the

I

(20-13) and Geoigia (24-0).

Pitt vs. South Carolina

KICKOFF: 3:50 p.m. Saturday
SITE: Williams-Brice Stadium, ColumbiafS.C.

EXPECTED ATTENDANCE: a capacity crowd of
54,406 is expected. it will be South Caroltna’s 15th
consecutive home sellout.

THE RECORDS: Pitt (2-0) defeated Illinois (26-6) and

Cincinnati (33-7) South Carolina (2-2) defeated Wake
Forest (23-6) and Duke (17-3) and lost to Mississippi

INJURY REPORT: The Panthers will do without
flanker Dwight Collins, who is still
hamstring pull. Listed as doubtful are Paul Dunn
(fractured bone in foot), Marlon Mclntyre (calcium
deposit in arm) and Todd Becker (thigh muscle pull).

TV COVERAGE: Regionally-televised game by ABC-
TV, on WTAE Channel 4 in Pittsburgh.

nursing a

ball.
“They both take a long arm action

like a high school quarterback. They
wind up before they throw, which is
good for our secondary when’we’re
reading where the ball will go,” said
Pitt free safety Tom Flynn. “They
can throw some. but they’re more
dangerous when they’re scrambling
around."

Besides Smith, Carolina’s_ top
offensive threat is converted full-
back Johnnie Wright, who replaced
Rogers at tailback this season.
Wright has rushed for 317 yards,
including two lO0-yard games, and
enters tomorrow’s game averaging
4.7 yards per carry.

Wright’s backfield partner is 6-I,
220-pound sophomore Dominique
Blasingame, who’s payingxhis dues
this year by blocking for Wright
more often than running the ball.

When he hasn’t been blocking,

Blasingame ‘has slipped out of the
backfield to haul in a team~high
eight receptions.

Although Carlen bemoaned the
injury problems that have sidelined
two of his five offensive linemen,
Pitt Coach Jackie Sherrill said
Carolina’s two replacements, Kenny
Gil and center Mark Austin, are
anything but stiffs.

“Eventhough they lost two play-
ers, their starting five up front will be
the same five that started for them
last year. They’re very strong and
physical.” Sherrill said.

Offensively, Pitt will have to con-
tend with Carolina’s tough defensive
line, led by 6-4, 260-pound middle
guard Emanuel Weaver and 6-4.
260-pound left tackle Andrew Pro-
vence. Trying to slow down Weaver

Pitt toWin Line Battle;WVUo ClipEag|es

By AMIN GHOSSEIN
Following last weekend’s pre-
ponderance of big games, this week’s
state is anorexic. While tomorrow’s
games lack a blockbuster entry such
as last week's Southern Cal-
sOklahoma clash, there are some
toss-ups that could be just as
exciting.
Pitt vs. South Carolina; On the
latest betting line, South Carolina is

_ getting seven points. and it mayjust.

be a good bet. Pitt’s first few offen-
sive series in the game are going to be
very important. Whether Emil
Boures and Bill Fralic can handle
Emanuel Weaver and Andrew Pro-
vence will dictate whether the Pitt
offense can move the ball.

Look for the Gamecocks to make
it a game for at least a half but Pitt’s
superior athletes will nullify Caroli-
na’s homefield advantage and emo-
tional crowd. Pitt, ‘in a good game,
24-19. T P

Temple vs. Penn‘ State: After a
tough win at Nebraska, Joe Pater-
no‘s crew has a breather against the
Owls. Wayne Hardin's bunch usu-
ally gives Penn State a tussle but not
this time: Penn State 36. Temple l7.

West Virginia vs. Boston College:
I got a lot of ﬂak for picking Boston
College to give North Carolina a
game. Boston College didn’t, losing

- 56-I4. Boston College isn’t that bad,
believe it or not. and the Mountai-
neers will have to fight to climb back

 

into the Top 20 ranks: WVU I9,
Boston College 14.

Southern Cal vs. Oregon State:
Hmmm...this is a tough one. USC
45, Oregon State 10.

Florida State vs. Ohio State: This

t could be a very interesting game if it

were being played at Tallahassee. It
isn’t, and Columbus has been the
downfall of many good teams. With
Art Schlichter on target this year,
the Seminoles are in for a long after-
noon. Ohio State should stay in the
Top l0: Ohio State 20. Florida State
7.

North Carolina vs. Georgia Tech:
North Carolina looked oh. so
impressive after humbling Boston
College. Now it’s time for Georgia
Tech to feel the Tarheel‘s wrath.
Tech’s Rambling wreck gets
wrecked, 38-7.

‘Mississippi State vs. Missouri:
Good ball game. State will once
again prove that they belong among
the nation’s elite: Mississippi State
21, Missouri l4.

Michigan vs. Indiana: Hoosiers
have been surprisingly competitive
this year. Michigan, aside from the
Notre Dame win. has not looked
very impressive. They won’t shine
this week either, but they'll win. 26-

Bethany Snaps Pitt Streak, 2-1

By LISA GRENEVICKI

Despite a desperate try. the Pitt
Panther soccer team suffered its first
season loss, to Bethany College
Wednesday, 2-l. at Pitt Stadium.
The defeat snapped Pitt’s six—game
win streak.

The constant scoring attack of
Bethany proved to be too much for
the stingy Panther defense, a high-
light of the Pitt team so far this sea-
son. Only a strong game by Pitt
goalie Scott Thunberg and the
Panther backs kept the game close.

Pitt jumped out to an early lead
when junior Troy Norton, replacing
injured Eric Tiedtke, scored his first
goal of the season in the first half.
Tiedtke, who was already playing

with right thigh contusion, strained’

ligaments in his left ankle Wednes-
day. Tiedtke was on crutches yester-
day and should miss anywhere from
one week to 10 days’ action.
Norton entered the game at
Tiedtke’s left wing position and,just

 

minutes later, took a pass from mid-
fielder Nick Wilson, raced down the
left side of the field and booted the
ball past Bethany goalieJohn Hines.
After the goal, play went back and
forth between both teams but there
was no more scoring. When thevfirst
half ended, Pitt led l—0.

In the second half, Bethany came
out aggressively. The Pitt defense,

which had frustrated Bethany in the‘

first half, couldn’t stem Bethany’s
two-goal outburst in the second half.

“Bethany really came out attack-
ing in the second half," said Norton.
“We had the lead and it seemed like
we just sat back. We didn’t come out
ready for the second half."

The Pitt defense, headed by the

aggressive play of Jim Hackworth,_
John Hagenbuch and Al Adelmann,
managed to hold off the Bethany
scorers until almost halfway into the

second period.

With about 18 minutes gone in the
second half, Bethany‘s Bill Dennis-
ton hit a hard drive to the net. Pitt
goalie Thundberg made a sensa-
tional save. But on the ensuing
corner kick, Bethany’s Denniston
headed in a ball for the score that
tied the game at l-l.

Bethany continued to pressure the
Panther defense and play remained
in the Pitt end ofwthe field as the
Panthers had trouble clearing the
ball out oftheir own zone. Just three
minutes after the score was tied,
Bethany’s Tracy Treverrow brought
the ball down the left side of the
field. Treverrow’s shot was too
much for Thundberg, and Bethany
led. ' C

It was all the scoring Bethany
needed, as they went on to beat the
Panthers 2-1. A slow drizzle
throughout most the game made
Pitt Stadium’s artificial turf
slippery, causing both team’s play to

The Pitt Lady Panthers cross
country team travels to Califor-
nia State for a rare dual meet
tomorrow, led by senior Margie
Lee and junior Sally Higgins.

Lee, coming back this season
from leg stress fractures that
sideline'd her most of last year,
enters the Cal St. meet fresh offa

City of Pittsburgh’s Great Race.
Lee covered the 6.2 mile course
in 37:45. Pitt first-year Coach
Elbert Kennedy expects Lee to
finish in the Top 5 in individual
standings at Cal St.

The Lady Panthers’ other top
hope isjunior Sally Higgins, who

Lady Panthers Duel

is off to a fast start so far this
season, according to Kennedy.

“Sally is running better now
than she did last year. She’s been i
improving steadily,” Kennedy
said. “Some of her times in prac-
tice have been better than Mar-
gie’s, but Margie seems to run
stronger in a meet. But Sally is
running very well.”

The other entries for the Lady
Panthers include team newcom-
ers Barb Billek, Kathy Budway,
and Melanie McCallister, a
member of the Pitt basketball
team last year who is trying her
hand at track this year.

tackle Bill Fralic.

Fralic. despite his tender age,
should give Provence a battle.

The 6-5. 265-pounder has the
strength— he bench presses around
500 pounds———and quickness to
match Provence. and the Panther
freshman is not above administering
a few licks of his own. ln Pitt’s first
two games. Fralic has deposited sev-
eral defenders on their backs.

Fralic also graded out at l00 per-

’ cent for his run blocking in Pitt‘s

romp over Cincinnati.

But he hasn’t faced anyone like
Provence and Weaver, who like to
stunt frequently on their pass rush.
According to Sherrill. both‘ Boures
and Fralic are in for their toughest

assignments -of the season
tomorrow.

“Emil Boures will have a contest,
and Fralic will have a contest," said
Sherrill. “They'll probably be the
best they‘ll face all year. l told both
our guys that we’ll find out how
good they are.”

Carolina also has strength in the
secondary, where junior strong
safety Pat Bowen and senior free
safety Rob Perlotte have combined
for five interceptions in their first
four games. Linebackers Mike Dur-
rah and J. D. Fuller are each coming
off good performances against
Georgia last week, when they com-
bined for 23 tackles, and 'they’re
often used on the blitz. It shapes up
to be a defense that.Sherrill has des-

cribed, in a word. “tough."

lniadditioln to its regular 5-2 align-
ment, Carolina frequently goes to a
nickel defense, trotting in defensive
back Chuck Finney in passing situa-
tions and removing either a down
lineman or a linebacker.

“They'll put him (Finney) in dif-
ferent places on the field.” Sherrill
said. To combat Pitt’s strong aerial
attack and Panther quarterback
Dan Marino. the Gamecocks may
also slip into the nickel defense more
often in unobvious passing situa-
tions.

“We haven’t faced a quarterback
like Marina yet. He can eat you
alive,” said Carlen. “I don’t know if
we can keep up with Marino. He
looks healthy, and his receivers are

' exceptional."

 

Phil Puzzuoli, a mainstay at defensive tackle, helps cement the Pitt defensive line

charged with containing South Carolina’s triple-option offense.

Eric Tiedtke’s ball-handling and scoring ability haslearned him a tryout invitation with the
New York Cosmos.

attacker. He is the closest we have to
a scoring machine."

Although he‘s smaller than most
players (5-7. 138 pounds) Tiedtke
doesn’t let his size hinder his play.

He’s a lot of soccer player in a
small package.” Bemis said.

What is it that makes Tiedtke such
a dangerous scorer‘?

“Tiedtke has a good shot and
good ball control.” said Bemis. “He
has the quickness and the speed.
which makes teams respect him.
He’s as intense competitor and
always a threat.”

Bemis isn’t the only one who’s
noticed Tiedtke’s talents. The New
York Cosmo ofthe North American
Soccer League have tentatively
invited the diminutive forward to a
tryout sometime nextyear. Tiedtke
will also spend next summer in Eng-
land, where he hopes to refine his

skills well enough to make a pro
team.

Panther booters may have to do
without Tiedtke’s services for
awhile; Tiedtke injured his left ankle
in Wednesday’s loss to Bethany.

X—rays taken yesterday revealed
that Tiedtke has strained ligaments.
He is on crutches right now, and
Bemis should know by Sunday
whether Tiedtke will play next Wed-
nesday.

Tiedtke also suffered a contusion
of the right thigh in the Mercyhurst
game. There hemorrhaging
occurred. and Tiedtke had the thigh
wrapped in Wednesday’s game.

Since Pitt is the midst of the
toughest part of its schedule, it will
need Tiedtke‘s scoring threat if it
hopes to match its stellar early-
season record.

And Tiedtke thinks Pitt’s final
record will remain impressive “ifyou
count ties," he smiled. “Penn State
and Akron are always tough. We’ll
give them a real good run for the

money. I always play my best at‘

Penn State, and l have always
enjoyed playing there. But it is much
enjoyable when you’re winning."
