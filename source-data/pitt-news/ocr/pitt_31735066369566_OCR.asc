WPGH, Hockey Club
Receive SGB Increase

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staffwriter

Student Government Board
voted last Wednesday to allocate
$38,231 for student organizations
for the fiscal year 1979-80,
completing its annual allocations
process. \

The groups—iwhich include all
but seven governance groups and
organizations under long term
contract to SGB that submitted
budgets to the board’s Allocations
Committee—had requested over
$104,000. A

SGB granted the funds after
rejecting allocations’ second sub-
mission of budget recommenda-
tions for the student organizations,
and after reconstructing the budget
package because of dissatisfactions
with opposed funding of the Pitt
Hockey Club and WPGH. the
campus radio station.

Board meml,e:s voted unan-
imously to grant the two groups
$6,000 each, and increase of $1,500
over the amount recommended by
allocations for the hockey club, and
an increase of $500 for WPGH.

To provide funds for the
increases, the board released
$5,000 from an escrow account

established for SGB’s Homecoming
Committee. 3

p That committee's budget, to-
talling $10,000, was to be held in
the account until committee mem-
bers were chosen not completed as
yet.

A change in the process for
selling student football tickets will
provide Homecoming Committee
with the $5,000 cut from its funds.

The Student Activities Office,
which oversees Homecoming, will
now be responsible for selling and
collecting revenue from sales of
football tickets.

Currently that responsibility
belongs to the athletic department.
Al Zangrillis, president of the Pitt
Hockey Club, appeared to be happy
with the group’s allocation, which
represents an increase of $1,000
over last year's budget.

' “We're barely getting by with
$5,000. . .each player has to pay
$100 in dues, plus equipment and
traveling expenses.” he said.
“The extra $1,000 will help us do a
little more than last year.”

Last season the club had to cut
one road trip and provide their own
transportation for two road trips

Emphasis On Science,  
Expert Tells ’79 Grads

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staff Writer

Richard C. Atkinson, the director of the National Science
Foundation, told Pitt’s graduating class last week that the United
States may lose its world leadership in science unless the federal
government and private industry begin to support research and
development more vigorously. 4

“At a time when other nations have been increasing their emphasis
on science, we have been pulling back,” said Atkinson at
commencement ceremony at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. “I’m not
going to enumerate the many reasons for this but I believe we have
reached a critical point where our world leadership in science is in
danger if the trend of the past 10 years persistsinto the future.”

To demonstrate the United States’ lessening emphasis in scientific
research Atkinson cited figures that showed the federal government’s
and industry’s support of research had dropped, and compared these
decreases to increases in support of research by Japan, West Germany
and the Soviet Union. 0

The science foundation director said that research and development
as part of the United States’ gross national product had dropped 20
percent from 1968 to 1978 while research and development in the
Soviet Union GNP.had increased 15 percent, hadrisen by 16 percent in
West Germany GNP and had increased by 20 percent in Japan GNP.
He also said the federal government funding of research had
dropped 34 percent and the fraction of engineers and scientists

involved in research had decreased 13 percent.

“What these comparisons show is that several other countries are
moving up rapidly to challenge our leadership,” said Atkinson.
“Moreover, virtually all of the West German and Japanese research is
concentrated in the civilian sector, whereas in the United States more

than half of the research and develo ment is for defense. We should-

not be sur-prised by the industrial payoff West Germany and Japan are
reaping from their investments.”

Atkinson said that West Germany’s and Japan’s emphasis on
research had helped to increase the productivity‘ of their countries. He
cited figures that showed West German output per worker/ hour had
increased about 60 percent from 1968 to 1978 while Japanese output
had risen 80 percent. ,

“While the causes of changing productivity rates are complex, we do
know that the ability. of industry to innovate is a key factor,” the NSF
director said. “It ismy belief that the research investments made by
West Germany and Japan in the 1960’s and 1970’s have contributed
significantly to their increasing productivity.”

with the weather having its ups and downs over the last two weeks, We sometimes hard to decide what type

of coat-it any-to wear around campus.

Tribal Factions Keptldi Amin in Power

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Pitt News Staff Writer

Gen. Idi Amin’s eight year reign
of terror was not the rule of a
madman, but the work of an
intelligent, uneducated man who
was able to manipulate tribal
factions in Uganda. Col. Gad
Wilson Toko, a founder of the
Ugandan air force, once tried by
Amin for plotting to overthrow the
government, said during a news
conference on campus last Tues-
day.

“From 1972, there have been
various reports indicating Amin is
insane. To me, Amin is sane and
very predictable,” said Toko, who
is now a research associate ‘at the
University Center for International
Studies.

“What is unique about Amin is
that his behavior has been
somewhat unorthodox for an
African‘leader. . . .the things he
has done are things that did not
surprise me personally because
they are things to be expected by a
man of his experience and a man of
his caliber."

Amin was an illiterate, non-
commissionedgofﬁcer in the British

Colonial Army in Uganda. After
Uganda gained independence,
Amin rose to the ranks of the new
army to become commander of the
new armed forces. He used his
power base to stage a coup d’ etat
in 1972.

Toko said Amin was able to rise
to power and remain there for so
long because of the factionalism
between the 26 tribes in Uganda
and the political parties, job

placement, regional development"

and recruitment in the army that
were allorganized on a tribal basis.
“Amin would have had no

‘chance to rise to the polition he did
without this factionalism,” added “
‘ eight years had brought about the

Toko, who has just returned from
Tanzania. ,

After his rise to power, Toko said
different attempts to overthrow
Amin failed because they were
based on factional divisions and
Amin always had support from
some Ugandan tribes, plus the
backing of the armed forces, and
aid from Libya and the Soviet
Union. A A

“How Amin stayed in power is
one of the most difficult questions
to answer because of the circum-
stances involved,” Toko said.

How to find
a summer job.

“Some reasons lie in the colonial
legacy, and some lie in the internal
politics of Uganda.”

The Tanzanians’ invasion of
Uganda ﬁnally forced different
factions opposed to Amin to unite
in the provisional government that
now rules Uganda, according to
Toko. He said that the factions
finally realized they had to unite to
win.

“To the advantage of the

‘Ugandans was the fact that the

major force moving against Amin
was not an Ugandan force.
Ugandan factions stood to lose if
they did not take advantage of
Tanzania,” said Toko. “Also,

understanding of the principle,
‘united we stand; divided we
fall.”’

Toko also said he did not believe
Amin couldvtake power now that he
has been forced to ﬂee Uganda.
Besides the united support of
Uganda’s military and the aid of
Libya and other Moslem nations,
Toko said that the former Ugandan
dictator had little popular backing
that he could use to rise to power
again. *

Nuclear accident causes concern

Children Worry Over Mickey, Donald

By The Associated Press

LOS ANGELES—Two Australian
children have written to a local
newspaper saying they are afraid
MickeyiMouse and Donald Duck
have been endangered by radiation
leaks and inviting them to hide out
in Australia.

The letter, delivered to the Los

Angeles Daily Journal, a legal
newspaper,‘ came from Meaghan
and Helen Pidd, ages 7 and 10, of
Waramanga, Australia.

“My sister and l have been very
worried about the radiation leaks in
America,” said the letter on
bunny-decorated stationary. “We
are hoping that Mickey Mouse and
Donald Duck are quite safe.

according to Toko. This must be
the first part of any attempt to
rehabilitate the nation's severly
damaged economy, he said.

“Any new government had to
gain the conﬁdence of the people

_and to be able to attract foreign

“If they are not safe,’ we would
love them to come and stay here
until everything is all right again.”

The letter concluded, “Would
you please give this letter to
Mickey at Disneyland, because we
don’t know the number of

It was signed “Luv.”

skeptical about returning to Ugan-
da. The new government has to
demonstrate that it is going to

country. ’ ' /

The Journal said it had contacted

both theworld-famous mouse and
duck are in fine shape despite the
recent nuclear mishap in Pennsyl-

Australian kids feel better.

“To be perfectly honest, it

Opinion

Mudslinging
At Its Best

President Jimmy Carter and Senator Edward M.
Kennedy are battling over Carter’s stance in the so-
called fuel crisis in yet another of the clashes that ap-
pear to be setting the pace and the stage for the selec-
tion of the 1980 democrat candidate in the presiden-‘
tial nomination.

Addressing the American Society of Newspaper
Editors in New York, Kennedy sniped that in order-
ing the decontrol on domestic oil prices, Carter was
‘-‘throwing in the towel” and is covering it up with a
fig leaf in the form of a windfall profits tax.

From the White House, Carter retorted that Ken-
nedy’s jibes were “just a lot of baloney.”

The tactics of both the senator and the president

are junior high level at best, but the gist of the S

rhetoric shows that Carter is on the defensive—he’s
apprehensive because the Massachusetts Democrat is
leading him in early public opinion polls on favorites

blanks.. Bypassing the issue of the lobbyists, Carter,
who is still smarting from the House Commerce
Committee’s refusal last week to support his
proposed standby gasoline rationing plan, alledged
that Kennedy was evidentually unaware that decon-
trol is mandated into the present law—unlike
“everybody who’s in the Congress.”

Mudslinging has begun in earnest and the heat of
the campaign is on. Too bad for Carter that he will
will stoop to sophomoric tactics and still remain am-
biguous on the issue.

How stronger would he seem had he taken Ken-
nedy on——issue for issue, even that of the oil lobby.

Sticks and stones may not break Carter’s—or
Kennedy’s bones—but words are hurting- -Especially

g Supreme Court Ruling Threatens Press Freedom

By LARRY LUNSFORD

The Supreme Court’s 6 to 3
ruling two weeks ago that public
ﬁgures suing for libel may inquire
into a journalist’s “state of mind”,
and the editorial process behind
theallegedly libelous statement, is
frightening and comes as a deﬁnite
threat to_press freedom and the
public’s right to know. '

The hlgh court’s ruling shows a
serious lack of sensitivity to the
First Amendment’s meaning and
will result with grim consequences
for some newspapers and other
media. It is the third of such court
decisions within the ‘past year

. which places restraints and obsta-

cles on journalists and ‘ their
reporting.

The recent decision stems from a
suit by Army Lt. Col.. Anthony
Herbert against CBS and others in

a $44.7 million libel case. The suit

for the democratic nomination.

And what makes Carter’s childish reorts even more
ludicrous is that Kennedy, at least on the oil issue, is
right on target. ' ’

Kennedy pinpointed the problem to the oil lobbies

in congress.

 “The oil lobby has -also intimidated the ad-
ministration into submitting a token windfall profits
tax that is no more than a transparent fig leaf over
the vast new profits the industry will reap,’.’ he

charged.

Kennedy’s words may be loaded, but Carter fired

was ﬁled in 1973 following a
segment titled “The Selling of
Colonel Herbert” on CBS’s news
magazine, “60 Minutes.” In that
show,» Herbert, who was stripped of
a batallion command and later
charged his superiors with covering
up war crimes in South Vietnam,
was called into question. Herbert
believed that the show’sproducer,
who also wrote his ﬁndings in an

article for the “Atlantic Monthly,” C

“falsely and maliciously” depicted
him as a liar and injured his
reputation.
On trial, the producer, Barry
Lando, refused to answer certain
_questions which he believed
infringed on his constitutional
rights under the free-press pro-
visions of the First Ammendment.
The new Supreme Court ruling
allows inquiry into the journalist's
mind as he was conducting his
research and writing his story‘.
Ken Morrell. editor and execu-

tive vice president of the Nashville
“Banner,” said in regard to /the
ruling: “I am disappointed, _of
course, that another decision of the
Supreme‘Court tends to further
erode freedom of the press as we
have known it under the First
Ammendment. It is increasingly
clear that because of these kinds of
adverse court rulings that the press
must ﬁght even harder to protect
the public’s right to know."

The decision takes on added
controversy in view of a recent
court decision prohibiting the
publication of an article in “The
Progressive" that included a
description of the design of a
hydrogen bomb.. Syndicated
columnist Richard Worsnop says
that decision “marked the first
time that prior restraint ever had
been imposed on the American
press inia national security case."

The third recent court case
involving press freedom came last

7  Outrageous Antics,

First-rate Musicianship
Highlights Tubes Show

By SCOTT MOWRY

We’re gonna kick your ass
tonight,” lead singer Fee Waybill
of The Tubes announced, much to
to the delight of a wildly
enthusiastic Stanley Theatre crowd
last Thursday night. p

Hailing from the San Francisco
school of the outrageously bizarre,

S. The Tubes mix hard driving rock

with satire and outright theatrical
presentations. They have built a

career around such kinky esca-C

pades as The Streakers Ball, which
admitted all naked members of tlfe
public free. a supporting role in the
skin-flick “The ‘Resurrection of
Eve” and such leather-and-chain
productions as “Mondo Bondage.”

But surprisingly, The Tubes’ two
hour show at The Stanley cut out
much of the glitter, pomp and
pageantry and concentrated on the
music, which showcased the band’s
new studio album “Remote Con-
trol.” Produced by the omni-
present Todd Rundgren and
sounding a lot like Meat Loaf,
“Remote Control” appears to have
defined a new direction for The
Tube‘s'and given them a much
needed hit album.

A Tubes concert, however, still
relies heavily on the wierd,
melodramatic talents of Waybill.
who along with female vocalist Re
Styles. transformed songs like
“Don't Touch Me There," “What

-Do You Want From Life” and
“White Punks On Dope” into
hillarious mini-operas.

The remaining seven musicians
of The Tubes, although highly
accomplished, seemed almost face-
less next to the overpowering

I presence of Waybill and Styles.

The Tubes’ obsession with
television provided the visual
emphasis of their stage, which
included a giant screen for
Waybill’s dramatic debut.

’ With a total of two guitarists, two
keyboardists, a bassist, two drum-
mers and Waybill. all wearing
florescent orange, The Tubes
launched into “Prime Time.”jj the
opening cut off “Remote Control.”
Eventually, through a blanket of
fog. a large real-life television set
roled out to center stage with the
stunning Styles perched atop
resembling “the girl from‘ the

Sanyo commercial." T
Television props hounded Way-

bill throughout the entire evening
as The Tubes ran through a string
of hits from their three previous
studio albums and most of
“Remote Control." The lead
singer responded to the attack of
the televisions.

With their music and collection
of outlandish skits, The Tubes
created a tense, high-strung
atmosphere with songs like “Tele-
suicide,” “Turn Me On” and their
most recognizable hit,‘ “White
Punks On Dope.” Their anthems,

. tightly constructed and intricately

arranged, sadistically assualted the
senses and left the. audience
quivering on the edge of their
seats.

A truly versatile showman,
Waybill raced through several
sweat-soaked‘ costume changes and
gallantly charged into the Stanley’
pit on many occasions.

At one point, he requested the
assistance of a well endowed
member of the audience for his
band’s biting analysis of American
society, “What Do You Want From
Life.” Plunging into the Stanley
crowd. Waybill emerged with ,a
busty brunette from among many
anxious volunteers. She was

awarded with an all-expense-paid

trip to the Fall Out Shelter Motel in

Harrisburg. Pa., as well as a,
radiation mask and lead-lined‘ fur

coat.

N-ot to disappoint the $8.75-a-
head paid crowd, The Tubes
drained every ounce of frenzy form
their fanatical fans with three
powerful encoress Their second
proved to be the highlight of the
show when Waybill appeared as his
most burleque character, Quay
Lude, complete with 12-inch
platform shoes. peroxide hair,
flashing “QUAY" glasses and
silver jump suit. With reckless
abandon. the group whipped’
through “I Was A Punk Before You
Were A Punk."

Finally. after Waybill discarded
his glitter rock outﬁt. The Tubes
began an intense version of their
all-time favorite “White Punks on
Dope.” Waybill was at his punkiest
as he tussled and jostled down in
the front row and hurled gobs of
spit high above ‘the audience's
heads.

The exhausting show climaxed

The Tubes (at top) appeared at the Stanley

Squeeze (bottom) and April Wine.

with renditions of two classic Who
tunes —— “Baba O’Reilly" and
“The Kids ‘Are Alright." Both
were done up Tubes style with
Waybill flaunting his best Roger
Daltry impression. It was certainly

 

a rare act of pure rock’n’roll for

this crazy. looned out band.
Perhaps the biggest and most

pleasant surprise of the evening

came from " Squeeze. a London
quintet of New Wave eccentrics

‘last Thursday night with their bizarre stage show. They were warmed-up by

with a likable lunacy for modern
rock. Squeeze’s thoroughly enter-
taining set barely stretched a half
hour but their ll songs were
charged with energy. wit and
humor that matched The Tubes.

Theater Express Closes Season

By MARK HOLAN
Pitt News Staff Writer
Hotel For Criminals
Directed by William Turner
Theater Express

Theater Express ended its first
season in the old Plaza Rubber
Building on Baum Boulevard this
past weekend witht“Hotel For
Criminals."

The play was created by Stanley
Silverman and Richard Foreman.
best known for their Broadway
revival of “The Threepenny
Opera." “Hotel for Criminals" is
based on certain novels by Pierre
Souvestre and Marcel Allain and
subsequent ﬁlm serials by Louis
Feuellade which explored the
mysterious. fantasmagoric under-
world of Parisian criminals.

The play is the loose knit and
rather fragmented story’ of Max

(Tom Spinella). a French journalist.
and his encounters with the sinister
master criminal Fantamos (Leslie,
Young( who runs an outlaw
hideout.

Unfortunatley. “Hotel For Crim-
inals" is completely devoid of a
plot. The story line that appears at
the beginning (Max falls in love
with Fantamos’ daughter) dis-
solves into oblivion throughout the
course of the play and is
non-existant when the curtain falls.

The play is saved. however. by
the blatently bizarre and comic look’
at the criminal underworld offered
by Theater Express through song
and dance. This keeps the
fragmented work from falling apart
altogether.

June Fortunato should be higmy
praised for her costume. make-up
and staging. Everything is done

in black and white; creating a

delightfully surreal effect for the

play.

Good choreography and strong
singing keep the pace moving and
the audience laughing. and it is
soon forgotten that nothing of
substance is being said or done.

Especially good are Young. with
his deep baritone voice. Susan
Cash as the evil vampiress Irma
Vep and Jed Harris as Judex and
Julot L'enjoleur. ,

Much to the young company's
credit. Theater Express will open
today at the Long Wharf Theater
Festival in New Haven. con-
necticut. They will be joined by
two other companies. one from
New York. the other from England.

Theater Express will present
their recent production of Gertrude

St_ein's “Made By Two."

Spring Game Few Surprises for Anyone

By‘SAM scrUL1To
Pitt News Staff Writer

If Pitt football fans were hoping
to see the new, wide-open offensive
display promised by Coach Jackie
Sherrill’s team, they would have
been better off not having attended
the Var'sity’s 26-7 defeat of the old
Pitt grads two weeks ago at Pitt
Stadium. Fans who became bored
by the game early in the second
half were at least able to stretch out
on the aluminum bleachers and
soak up some of El Sol’s rays.

Pitt opens the 1979 season at
home against Kansas September
15. and the new Jayhawks’
coaching staff sent a representative
to Pittsburgh to see what all the
commotion was about. And to say
that Sherrill kept his team under
wraps would be an understate-
ment. The Superdome couldn’t
have covered it any better. Junior
college transfer fullback Randy
McMillen carried the ball only a
few times, but was impressive
enough throughout spring drills to
be the top candidate for the big
running back position.

The halfback slot is less certain.
Fred Jacobs has to be considered
the favorite, havingbeen a starter
the last two years. Rooster Jones
was a first stringer last year, but
will probably duel with Artell
Hawkins for the top backup
positions._ But, in all probability,
Sherrill will shufﬂe his‘ stable of
runners in and out, seeing that
each gets enough playing time. In

Game.

certain situations, Pitt will prob-
ably use three running backs at the
same time, utilizing the Power-I
and, quite possibly, the wishbone,
but not very often.

In the spring game, Rick Trocano

I

Evangelista photo

threw the best pass of his career, a
78-yard touchdown pass to Willie
Collier in the second quarter. All
told, Trocano completed six passes
for over 100 yards, and_ clearly
displayed that he was the best

quarterback on the ﬁeld, the
alumni signal callers notwithstand-
ing. Neither Scott Jenner nor
Danny Daniels is likely to take the
job from the red-haired incumbent-.

But someone else could, refer-
ring to Dan Marino,"the hot
propsect from Central Catholic
High who observed the game from
the sidelines. Sherrill has even
said as much. Commenting on the
quarterback position afterwards,
he stated that Trocano got off to a
good start in the spring, went down
a little, then improved towards the
end. Sherrill then explained that
Trocano would be the starter
entering fall practice, but that the
possibility existed for him to be
beaten out, but that it would have
to be by a “good quarterback.”

Come September 15, look for
Trocano and Marino to be numbers
one and two, but not necessarily in
that order.

Whoever’s throwing the passes
won’t have Gordon Jones and Steve
Gaustad around to be hauling them
in. Instead, Collier has established
himself at one of the receiver
positions, while Ralph Still, Cliff
Moore and possibly Larry Sims are
of equal ability. Immediate help
could be coming from another
freshman, Julius Dawkins of_
Monessen, a 6’2 leaper who some
people have called the best wide
receiver to come out of this area
since Mr. “Too Much” himself.

Pitt’s coaches are hopeful that
Benji Pryor will come. to the front

and. live up to the greatness
everyone predicted for him two
years past. If not, look for Rico Cox

or a freshman named Ballard,from'

the hills of West Virginia.”

Not as many question marks
abound on the offensive line, where
many experienced players return,
the biggest concern being the
center position, where Walt Brown
will most likely be replaced by Russ
Grimm or Rocky Destefano. An
inordinate number of redshirted
linemen ﬁgure to lend depth and
talent in the trenches.

But the defense is where Pitt’s
coaches don’t seem to have much
to worry about. Linemen Greg
Meisner, Bill Neill, Jerry Boyarsky,
Hugh Green and Ricky Jackson
have all started at one time or other
and each will be a junior.
Translated, this means Pitt’s
defensive front is set for the next
two seasons, with John Hendrick
and Jimbo Covert serving as able
replacements.

Another seasoned vet, Jeff
Pelusi, will man his customary
linebacker position alongside Steve
Fedell. Carlton Williamson could
inherit Jeff Delaney’s strong safety
position, while Barry Compton

Pitt and the Penn-dulum Threewinners and Some Show

Panthers Siriano, Kinney,
A Pantherette Miller All Win

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Sports Editor

Both the Pitt men’s and women’s
track teams came home with
individual winners at the 85th
annual Penn Relays Carnival.
Triple jumper Larry Kinney and
distance runner Gary Siriano were
top ﬁnishers for. coach Mike
Agostinella’s Panther squad, while
1978 Pantherette cross-country

‘runner Diane Miller captured the

women's division of the Penn
Relays marathon in record time.

Kinney’s best legal jump of 50
feet. 11 inches was good enough
for ﬁrst place in the college
division, although he fouled a jump
over 51 feet.

Siriano, employing a “drop back,
sprint ahead" race plan, kicked in
the ﬁnal lap of his college division
5000 meter run to win in 14:26.3,
three seconds ahead of George-
town's Matt Wilson. Penn State’s
Alan Scharsu won the champion-
ship division, while former world
indoor mile record holder Dick
Buerkle was a winner in the
Olympic developmental division.
All three races were run Thursday
night in a pouring rain.

“) The two—mile relay of Darren

Geary. Greg Conover, Joel Albers
and Bill McShea did not qualify for
ﬁnals but were fourth in their heat
with a 7:36.6 clocking for 3200
meters. Pitt’s mile relay of Larry
Shippen. Dwayne Defore. Bud

, finishing fifth

Cooper and Keith Leckenby placed
third in their heat in 3:15.

Other Panther competitors were
Gene Roach (pole vault), Tim
Blackshear (long jump) and assis-
tant coach Barry Harwick (5000
meters). ' ' .

Former Pantherette Miller won
the marathon in 3:04, a new Penn
Relays record. Pitt’s best showing
of the weekend, however, was high
jumper Karen Krichko’s second-
place ﬁnish at 5 feet, 8 inches.
Krichko _beat out Maryland’s
Jalene Chase and team mate Marie
Ribik, but was outjumped by
0lympian’Paula Girven of Mary-
land, who set a new meet record at
5 feet, 10 inches. Krichko just
missed at 5-10, while Ribik was
fourth overall at 5-6.

Also placing fourth for Pitt was
the 400-meter relay team and Peri
Jude Radecic. The team of Leslie
Palmer, Cissy Wilborn, Gwen
Murray and Linda Mitchell were
seeded fourth going into Friday's
ﬁnals after a time of 47.6 in the
trials. They lowered this time by
three-tenths in the ﬁnals, but were
outdashed by Morgan State,
Adelphi and Auburn.

Radecic's discus throw of 138-7
placed her fourth overall, then
added a ﬁfth-place in the shot put
at 44 feet. 9 and 3/4inches. Team-
mate Carmen Scherich threw -well,
in the javelin
competition with a 145 foot, 9 inch
effort.

  Batmen Keep Winning, '
Now 9-2 ’

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s baseball team, runnerup
in the recent Eastern Eight
tournament, will carry a 9-2 record
into tomorrow’s doubleheader
against Indiana of Pa. at Trees
Field.

So far,.the Panthers have swept
three doubleheaders (two from
Carnegie3’Mellon and one from
Robert Morris); split another

, doubleheader (with West Virginia);

and won twice in the inaugural
Eastern Eight tournament in
Hershey. «

Their latest loss was two weeks

ago against George Washington in
‘the Eastern Eight championship
game. Their other loss was against
West Virginia April 14 at Trees
‘Field. .

With 13 games remaining, the
Panthers should improve upon last
season’s 11-17-1 record.

— “We have more maturity this
4 year than we did last year,” Pitt
“It_ is
evident that our freshmen and
sophomores aren’t making the

4 same mental and physical mistakes

they were making last year.”
“We’re starting to hit the ball
well,” added Panther catcher Jim
Pastin. “Before, we wererr’t
hitting and it was hurting us. Now,

we're hitting and we’re winning.”
Through nine games, second
baseman Duane Sakanich was the
team’s leading hitter with a .367
batting average. Following Sakan-
ich were third baseman Chris
Mihalik (.357 batting average);
shortstop Marc Massa (.354); and
outﬁelders Mark Stevens (.350)
and Rich Kline (.303).
As a team, Pitt was batting .295,
compared to its opponents’ .215.
Tomorrow, Pitt will need to hit
and pitch well. Indiana of Pa.,
according to Lewis, has “an
excellent team.” \ —
Last season, the Indians defeat-
ed Pitt, 15-6 and 4-2, at Indiana. ’

BASEBALL NOTES: Tomor-
row’s doubleheader will begin at 1
p.m....Pitt has been idle since
Wednesday, when it defeated
Carnegie-Mellon, 8-1 and 6-3, in a
doubleheader at ‘Trees Field...
Weekend, games against Catholic
and Buffalo at Trees Field were
rained out....The weather probably
has been the Panthers’ toughest
foe. Four ’doubleheaders have
been called off because of
inclement conditions....Only one of
the four have been rescheduled.
Pitt will meet Buffalo in a makeup
doubleheader May 12 at Trees
Field. ~

won the sprint medley and 3200—meter relays. The
Wildcats have won 71 championship races since they
began competing at Penn Relays. \ .
Villanova’s women set a few records themselves.
Jennifer Whitfield, Sue Shea, Brigid Leddy and
Doriane Lamebelet, winners at the Pitt Invitational,
Princeton Relays and EAIAW championships to
name a few meets, broke the old 3200-meter relay
record by over two seconds, and won in 8:47.8. Led-
dy then fought it out with Penn State’s Patty Mur-
nane in the open 1500-meter championship with a
time of 4:20.4. Leddy broke the record held by Penn

2 State’s Kathy Mills.

Other outstanding performances by college women
included Tennessee’s Brenda Webb in the 3000
meters (new Carnival record of 9:09.2), and Morgan
State’s 400-meter relay team‘.

Attendance for the three-day affair was lowered
somewhat by the damp weather. Nonetheless,

crowds of 9,000, 11,000,and 25,000 were present.‘

Outside’ Franklin Field, hordes of athletes and spec-
tators made their way around booths peddling
everything from soft pretzels to T—shirts.

The Penn Relays includes some of the nation’s best
high school track talent. Philadelphia’s William
Penn High School set a national record in the girls’
3200-meter relay; runner-up Tech'High School had
established “the record several weeks earlier. For her
efforts (a 2:08 anchor leg in that relay), William
Penn’s Cynthia Colquitt was named Outstanding
Female High School Performer,

It was a good meet for Pennsylvanians and other
local schools. Besides Pitt men’s wins in the triple
jump and 5000 meters, Penn State won the
marathon, steeple chase-, championship division 5000
and 10,000 meters while West Virginia University’s
Garnett Edwards won the 1l0—meter hurdles.
