Pitt’s School of Arts & Sciences has
ofﬁcially been renamed the Ken-
neth P. Dietrich School of Arts 8:
Sciences.

The vote passed at a Board of
Trustees meeting on Friday morn-
ing to rename the school in honor
of donor William S. Dietrich II’s
father.

In September, William Dietrich
donated $125 million to Pitt —— the
largest individual gift to the_Univer-
sity in its 225—year history, and one
of the 10 largest gifts given by an
individual to a public university.

In response to the gift, which
became operational upon Bill
Dietrich’s death on Oct. 6, the
Board of Trustees introduced the
resolution to rename the Univer-
sity’s School of Arts 8: Sciences. The
school is composed of nearly 50
departments and programs and
more than 10,000 undergraduate
students. The University has al-
ready launched a new website for
the renamed school.

Pitt’s schoolrenaming follows
CMU’s decision to rename its Col-
lege of Humanities 8: Social Sci-
ences after Bill Dietrich’s mother.
Dietrich donated $265 million to
Carnegie Mellon in early Septem-
ber.

A Pittsburgh native, Bill Dietrich
was born in 1938 and received his
masters and Ph.D. from Pitt. He
turned his family~owned construc-
tion business into Dietrich Indus-
tries Inc., a large manufacturer of
light metal construction framing.

He joined Pitt’s Board of
Trustees in 1991 and served as
the Board’s chairman from 2001
to 2003. I

Plant to Plae embes donate harvests

Shaé Felicien
Staﬁ" Writer

Tucked between the concrete streets
of South Oakland lies a hidden gem
of greenery. Yet sometimes those
who stop to take notice of the urban
garden located on Oakland Avenue
hurt it more than they help it ﬂour-
ish.

Plant to Plate, a student—run or-
ganization that grows Vegetables and
donates them to various organiza-
tions, has witnessed its garden of
fruits and vegetables grow before its
eyes. But the members have also seen
the aftermath of mischief, as some of
their vegetables have lain in pieces or
have disappeared altogether.

“Something that has been very
challenging is the vandalism on
the plot. It’s not that we’ve had too

much damage, but it is somewhat
demoralizing,” junior Brianna Mc-
Donough, the head gardener for
the group, said. “We’ve put so much
time into it, and we take such care of
these delicate little plants. So when
somebody comes and kicks it, ->i_,t_ij"s
somewhat sad.” }“;}

When the group of seven met
Sunday afternoon for its end-of-
season harvest, it noticed the miss-
ing and broken pieces of kale in on;
of the twelve plots. ‘

Currently, a pseudo-fence en-
compasses the garden — the front
and right sides are made of wood 
the left side is mainly constructed of
string attached to poles. Though the
fence marks off the area, it does not
deter those committed to entering
the space.

“A lot of [plants] do bounce back,

TANTALIZING TTS. PAGE 5.

we’ve just got to keep growing,” Mc— , V

Donough said. The environmental
studies major eventually hopes to
pursue her interests by growing on
her own land one day.

McDonough noted the regrowth
of parsley in one of the plots after it
was vandalized.

“Somebody stole all of our pars-

ley and cut it down to an inch, but.

now it’s starting to grow back” she
said, smiling.

The biggest challenge for the
group as the season experiences
an abrupt change is the prospect
of growing in its greenhouse. The
students of Plant to Plate grow more
than a dozen items rangingfrom car-
rots and kale to strawberries and
edible ﬂowers.

Seniorjustin Seaman, Plant to
Plate president, said that the plastic

nature of the greenhouse makes it
harder to trap the heat within the
space. .

‘‘I’m constantly doing re-
pairs,” Seaman said.

Seaman discussed with fellow
group members plans for insulat-
ing the space that houses the group’s
brussel sprouts and spinach. He
plans to implement a solar—based
design by lining the area with black
trash bags to trap heat.

' Unless it continues to snow, Sea-
man said the plants should still be
able to grow in the greenhouse.

Like the outdoor garden, the
greenhouse — a 16-by-8-foot
structure located toward the back
of the plot — has also been hit by
Vandalism. V T

Student group deals

Plant 4 1

with garden vandalism

Kenny Bug 1 Senior Staff Photographer

Senior Justin Seaman harvests fruit at the Oakland Avenue urban garden this

Earlier in the year, two of the building’s A

windows had been broken, making the chal-
lenge of insulating the space even more difficult

for the group. They have since been ﬁxed with I

layers of plastic patching, but the damage is
still visible.

Still the group remained optimistic about its
ability to donate vegetables this-season.

Much of what is cultivated by Plant to Plate
is donated to groups like Feel Good, a campus
organization that makes grilled cheese for a
cause each week, Sodexo and the Squirrel Hill
Community Food Pantry.

But senior Becca Tanen notes that the
group members do keep some of the food for
themselves. ’ .

’ Tanen, head chef of Plant to Plate, had the

' task on Sunday of designing a menu for that

day’s harvest. Each Sunday the students pick

which vegetables are ready and take them to '

‘ ; summer as part of Plant to Plate.

the Hilleljewish University Center to prepare
for their weekly Plant to Plate meal.

Tanen said that as a vegan, she enjoys the
challenge.

“I’ve" always been really» passionate about
the importance of locally grown products‘
and organics and how what you eat aﬁ'ects
your body and the environment around you,”
Tanen said. ‘

— Tanen planned to use the harvests of the day
to make homemade pesto, broccoli additions
to a soy stir fry and her favorite kale chips. Oil,
salt and pepper are added to the kale before
they are placed in the oven to make a crunchy
chip dish.

' “It opens up awhole new world. People can
be so limited in their food choices, but when
you grow something and see it come out of
the ground, it’s an entirely new experience,”
Tanen said. 3

South Oakland

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Pitt police received a report of a sexual assault
on Saturday that occurred at an unknown
address on Parkview Avenue in South Oak-
land.

The report was received at 3:14 p.m., but
the incident took place at 1 a.m., according to
the Pitt police media log.

Representatives from Pitt and Pitt police
were not immediately available for com-
ment.

City police usually handles incidents that
happen off-campus, but the sexual assault is
not listed in the city police blotter. A staffer at
the city police department of sexual assault on
Monday did not have a record ofthe assault.

The Pitt police media log states that an
investigation is pending. ﬂ

The new rules allow for heftier,
longer-lasting scholarships and
increased academic standards. We
think it’s about time the NCAA did its
part to make sure its student-athletes
are succeeding in areas other than
sports —— or at least keeping their
heads above academic water.

The NCAA’s Division I.Board'of

Directors voted to allow conferences ~g
to provide up to $2,000 a year in

spending money to their athletes,
reintroducing a stipend that was

in effect until 1972. Also, schools V

could be allowed to guarantee ca-
reer scholarships for players. Cur-

ing the housing—education compari-
son on Oct. 20. The steam-gathering
of bubble thinking is dangerous. But
before I get to why, let’s consider
its appeal. _

The comparisons between the
college cost structure and the hous-
ing mess are unavoidable. Like hous-
es once were, acollege education

has longbeen understood as aticket ‘

to the middle class that comes at.a
premium so expensive that millions
of college consumers ﬁnance their
investment on credit. Reminiscent
of the subprirne mortgage mess,
the federal government makes this
credit easy to acquire, providing
loans and grants and backstopping
ﬁrms that issue private loans. And
although speculators haven’t started
trading student loan—backed securi-
ties, demand for college education
has recently unambiguously in-
creased:.According to the National
Association for College Admission
Counseling, college applications
received by four-year institutions
increased 70 percent between 2001
and 2008.

Some people look at these ob-
servations and scream, “Bubble!”
But there are serious ﬂaws in the
premise, and, even without the
ﬂaws, the adverse consequences of
a bubble—based policy — like re-
ducing public appropriations or, in
Paul-’s case, removing federal credit
entirely ——- seem overlooked, per-
haps’ intentionally. ‘ O

V The sharpest fact that threatens ,
the bubble premise is returns. That i

is, while college prices» have risen
faster than inflation for 50 years,

studies have repeatedly concluded '

a positive return oninvestment (i.e.
graduates end up with more accu-
mulated income than non-college-
goers). And what does the Bureau of
Labor Statistics report will protect
you from the 9.1 percent unemploy-
ment rate? A college degree, which
endows its bearers with less than
half that rate. Bubble thinkers need
hard evidence to make the “over—
valuing” claim —— and they don't

    

credit would price millions out of
the higher-ed market,‘ and with a
slump in applicants, tuition would
probably fall. But that doesn’t mean
the high school student passed up
for ﬁnancial reasons would drop his
desires for a college experience; the
internal value Americans now hold
for education is not dependent on
loan availability.

But let’s say this is a bubble af-
ter all. After the bubble’s identiﬁed,
pulling the federal rug from under-
neath the higher-ed system 4 in
whatever gradation — could prove
disastrous. First, academic research
departments are often supported by
tuition dollars, and denying loans to_
students could meana huge blgw.t0
scientiﬁc progress. More important—,
ly, a higher-ed market without easily.
attainable loans would discriminate
against low—income families, by def-
inition. If that could get any worse,
co1leges,,hesitant_ to take a hatchet
.to their payroll to make up for fall-
ing revenues, would have a strong
incentive to judge the applicants
that remain in terms of payment
potential, perhaps at the expense of
merit; Frankly, it’s hard to see how

a solution like Paul’s would pan out -

any better than letting a so-called
bubble run its course. ‘
Granted, American higher edu-
cation is far from adequate. Only
56 percent of all students in four-
year programs graduate in sixyears
or fewer, an’d:'less"than 60 percent

of thosefwho actually graduated

in.2009 landed jobsuthat’r_equire,a

; degree. Add to that the likelihood a
college-for-all attitude w.on’_t'rev,erse
7 technology’s hollowing out¥oft’r1id-

dle‘-class jobs think. automated
legal services and ,computer—aided
diagnoses — and a major re-eval-
uation‘ of ‘college’s role in society

V is most deﬁnitely overdue. It’s just

that, given the stakes, we can’t let
carelessness infect our decision-
making. ' *

WRITIEN BY EMMA KILCUPV
V PHOTOS BY ANTHONY GIMA

The inked and the artists who
decorate them gathered at the
Radisson Hotel in Pittsburgh
for the 20th Annual Meeting of
the Marked, a convention that
includes exhibits, contests and
seminars revolving around tat-
toos. A

Natalie Bercik, shop manager.

and piercing apprentice at Unique
Ink in Greensburg, Pa., ﬁrst visited
the shop when she turned 18 and
said her reaction to tattoos was
like a “moth[’s] to ﬂame.”

“This convention is a great way
for the national tattoo community
to come together with people from
Pittsburgh and across the coun-
try,” Bercik said.

She explained that a lot of tal-
ent visits the convention, and so
it’s important to choose the right
artist with the right style when
getting a tattoo.

Take, for example, Jake Del-
Bene from Allentown, Pa., who has
been tattooing for 12 years.

“Some of my favorite tattoos _

I got tattooed by my mom and

dad,” DelBene said. “They [didn’t] I

know what they [were] doing, but I

couldn’t tell. Training doesn’t take ’

long — it’s just all about practice
and artistic ability.” 7

And, of course, the image itself
is important. DelBene said that he
tries to keep the designs simple
and stays away from anything too
intricate. But he did once dedicate
48 hours to a back tattoo.»

' Bercik said that, in her opin-
ion, beauty is more important
than meaning. . i

V “I think you need slight mean-
ing, but I also love classic images
that I know I’ll love and will make
good tattoos,” Bercik said. “Being
in this community helps that —
recognizing that you don’t need an

intensely. deep meaning but just a ‘

beautiful tattoo.”

Bercik has many tattoos but
does not do any inking herself.

“I have so much respect for
them, but I would never. I’m not
an artist,” Bercik said. “You want
your customer to leave with a piece
they love. It’s really an art.” I

Students Show ‘Imprint of War’  was  fléxhibit

Written By Skylar Wilcox

Late on a Monday night, students
fluttered through the University
Art Gallery, setting tiny 17th-cen-
tury prints into delicate wooden
frames. They had less than a week

to prepare for what was, for many H.

of them,‘ their first public art ex-
hibition.

“This is more hands—on than
any other class I’ve taken at the

University,” senior history of art . .
and architecture major Colleen‘

Bernhard said.  , _

Bernhard is one of ‘the zé
students running the exhibit as
part of the history of art and ar-
chitecture department’s Museum
Studies Seminar.

Last night, the University
Art Gallery in the Frick Fine
Arts Building hosted the grand
opening of the class’s' exhibit,

“Imprint of War: Responses in .

Print,” which runs until Dec. 5.
The class chose to focus the ex-

“Printmaking is a cyclical pro-

choose the theme. “Our exhibit
looks _at_ the common themes be-

cycles.” ;

Savage is the leader of the

wise, we can create sympathetic reactions.”
For a moment, what we see is a reﬂection
of ourselves, and what happens in those
images is happeningto us,” Naughton said
in an interview with the class.

The class spent its first month speak-
ing with artists and making field trips to
local galleries. The students visited the
Pittsburgh Glass Center to learn about the
state and federal grants upon which many
galleries survive. Bernhard said the staff
showed them the decisions that go into
running a gallery, from piece selection to
how works will be displayed.

Now that the exhibit is up and running,
theclass will continue to meet. The stu-
dents will read essays about running mu-

The exhibit featured work from contemporary artist Nicholas Naughton’s series “Reas0n’s Mon-

sters,” which was inspired by Franciso Goya’s “Disasters of War.”

   a field trip to afor-proﬁt

museum, Savage said.

_ McCall hopes that visitors will not be
the only ones taking away a message from
the exhibit. The portfolio of work that the
students will have produced for the class
“can be a real edge for getting an entry-
level position at an [artistic] organiza-
tion,” she said.

In a competitive job market, practical
classes like Museum Studies can look great
on resumés, Bernhard said.

“Last summer, I applied to internships
and got turned down by some because I
was lacking experience. Not professional
experience, but academic experience,
because I hadn’t taken this class,” Bern-

hard said. The senior originally planned to
graduate and to seeka master’s degree in
art history, but this course convinced her
to consider pursuing museum studies, She
explained that most galleries’ nonproﬁt
status makes them less likely to hire and
said that they often seek candidates who
come in with advanced degrees as well as
experience.

For students looking to get positions at
the many small galleries throughout Pitts-

I burgh, the chance to put on an exhibition

the Panthers had three wrestlers

classes. Yet the team,ultimate_ly

didn’t ﬁnish with any wrestlers in I

the top 8 of their weight classes,
leaving Pitt with no All-Americans
for the ﬁrst time since,2006.

One wrestler especially disap-
pointed with his and the team’s
performance was junior Anthony
Zanetta. Zanetta wonhis opening
match at 125 pounds at Nationals
before a loss dropped him into the
consolation round. In the conso-
lations, Zanetta won one match
before having his season end with
a tough 5-3 decision to Sean Boyle
of Michigan.

' “I think that we didn’t reach

defending something, you start I

e know it.”

Its third consecutive Eastern
Wrestling League title is a good
challenge, but the team’s goal to
ﬁnish in the top 10 at the NCAA
Championships in March is what
really gets them riled.

“I know at least I have a poor
taste in my mouth about such a
poor NCAA Tournament last year,”
Stottlemyer said. “I know I would
have bet my’ house on us having a
few guys on the podium. We went
back to the drawing board to go at
it this year.” .

When EWL duals kick off Dec.
11 at Cleveland State, the Panthers
will appear to be in the midst of the
next chapter of a three—team race
between Pitt, West Virginia and
Edinboro. Both West Virginia and
Edinboro are currently not ranked
in the top 30 teams in the nation,
but each team is returning a solid
core group of wrestlerscurrently
projected to be the -best at their
weight in the EWL.

», Tino Sunseri hasbeen 
iOﬂ'Aen_sive Player of the Week ‘after’ the Pan-

thers’ decisive 35—20 win over Connecticut
last Wednesday.

The junior quarterback’ passed for 419
yards and two touchdowns against the
Huskies on 29 of 42 passing, completing
69 percent of his passes and throwing no
interceptions. He also ran for a touchdown
in the ﬁrst quarter.

His passing yardage was the highest of
any Pitt quarterback since 2003, when Rod
Rutherford threw an identical 419 yards
against West Virginia. Sunseri and Ruther-
ford are now tied for the fourth-most single-
game passing yards in Pitt history.

Sunseri’s passing performance helped the
Panthers amass 529 yards in total offense,
which is the most the team has tallied since
they went for 584 yards in a 42-26 victory

. over Boston College in 2000.

The junior quarterback’s yardage total
also broke the Heinz Field collegiate record,
previously held by Tyler Palko who threw
for 380 yards against Furman in 2004. Cur-
rently,. the only person to throw for more
yards at Heinz Field is the Steelers’ Ben
Roethlisberger, who passed for 503 yards
against the Green Bay Packers in 2009.

Sunseri will try to replicate the perfor-
mance this Saturday when the Panthers host
the nationally ranked Cincinnati Bearcats.
The Bearcats are currently 6-1 and ﬁrst in
the Big East Conference.

Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. at Heinz Field
and will be televised by ESPNU. ﬂ
