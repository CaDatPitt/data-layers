Brian Davis

Three Pitt football players, running backs Brian Davis and
Craig Heyward and wide receiver Tony Williams, felt the
wrath of head coach Mike Gottfried over the weekend.

Davis, a tailback with sophomore eligibility from
Washington, Pa., was suspended from the team for missing
class and refusing to work out. He is rumored to be transfer-

ring to Ohio State.

Heyward, also a sophomore, was charged Friday with sim-

Heyward allegedly threw his 12-year-old paper boy into some

bushes, then threw him on a car. He has a hearing in front

of a district magistrate this Friday.

Williams, a sophomore from Freedom, Pa., never played

a down for Pitt, and never will. Gottfried dismissed him from

the team on Friday. Williams had four campus altercations

over a 12-month period.

PIP director quits after dispute

By Leeli Davidson
Staff Writer

Janet Markel, director of Pitt’s In-
formal Program, has resigned as a
result of what she said are “divergent
philosophies” between herself and the
university concerning the way PIP
should be run.

In her resignation letter, published in
the Pittsburgh Post Gazette on March
11, Markel said, “The program can-

i not function successfully or solvently

when a small, hardworking staff is con-
stantly second-guessed and undercut.”
Courses offered at PIP include Ukra-
nian egg decoration, elementary Rus-
sian, beginner’s astronomy and crea-
tive writing. All courses are non-credit,
and according to Markel, cater to the
25-45-year-old crowd who have al-
ready had their education and take
courses for “self-enhancement. ”
The dispute between Markel and the

. university began a few weeks ago

when College of General Studies Dean

John Bolvin appointed a committee to

‘ evaluate PIP. Since September 1985,

PIP has been under the authority of
CGS.
The PIP review committee, whose

11 members come from different uni- .

versity departments, has suggested
various changes in PIP’s curriculum
and teaching staff. Markel was on the
committee, as is present PIP staff
member Betty Goodwin. Both Markel
and Goodwin disagree with the com-
mittee’s conclusions and procedures.

The committee has suggested that all
of PIP’s “how-to” courses be elimi-
nated and that all PIP courses should
be educational. The committee has also
recommended that the majority of
PIP’s staff be University of Pittsburgh
professors.

Markel said she dislikes both the
committee’s recommendations and the
way the committee has interacted with
her and her staff. The committee’s tac-
tics have both “confused” and “de-
moralized” her and her staff, Markel

said. Ellen Caldwell, the acting pro-
gram director, and Betty Goodwin,
travel director, are two top PIP staff
members who ‘said they agree with
Markel about the committee. Both
Caldwell and Goodwin said their jobs
have been adversely affected by the

. committee’s methods.

According to the three women, the
PIP review committee sends the PIP
staff confusing messages about how to
proceed. As an example of theiperplex-
ing signals that the staff has tried to
decipher from the committee, Markel
said that within one week, Caldwell
ﬁred and then rehired a PIP teacher
because of different committee di-
rections. _

“Last week Ellen was told that we
weren’t allowed to teach the course
‘Positively Singular,’ ” said Markel,
“so Ellen ﬁred the instructor. And
then, ﬁve days later, on Fri., March

14, John Bolvin told her that she could
have the course as long as she rewrote

Latin Americans celebrate heritage

By Mike Churchill
For The Pitt News

The seventh annual Pitt Latin-
American festival attracted a very large
and colorful crowd to Forbes
Quadrangle this past Saturday. The
event featured traditional music, danc-
ing and food from many Hispanic
countries.

The hundreds of Latin Americans in
attendance expressed a pride in their
culture that was evident in every aspect
of the festival. The beautiful costumes,

the skilled performers and the endless
varieties of food made for a very suc-
cessful event.

“It’s wonderful,” said Pitt Spanish
teacher Beryl Pinto. “I think it's very
important for people to have a chance
to experience the culture in so many
different ways.” Pinto, who sold
Brazilian food, was helping to raise
money for a Brazilian boy who has
come to Pittsburgh for a liver
transplant. «

The main attraction of the festival
was the stage show. For most of the

day various dance troupes and musical
groups performed traditional Latin-
American numbers for a highly en-
thusiastic crowd. Many people sang
along to the songs they knew while
others were clapping and stomping
their feet.

“It gives Latin Americans a chance
to get together and express a bit of their
culture and share it with the universi-
ty.” said Michelle Bowman, a former
exchange student to Brazil.

“I wish we had more food,” was a

Hazingreported by
Pitt sorority pledge

By Dan Bates
News Editor

The university administration is cur-
rently investigating the Alpha Kappa
Alpha sorority after receiving several
reports of alleged hazing.

The incidents were reported to Stu-
dent Activities Director Andrew Smith
last Thursday by an unidentified
freshman sorority pledge from
Wilkinsburg who walked into his of-

, ﬁce on crutches, Smith conﬁrmed.

Smith would not disclose any further

.details about the report, but he did say

the sorority will be ofﬁcially informed
about the report and the university's
current investigation at a meeting this
afternoon at 3:30 p.m. At this point,
Smith said, no date has yet been set for
a formal hearing because both the
university and the sorority must ﬁrst
gather the “necessary information” to
conduct a hearing.

Smith added that he was somewhat
surprised by the report because “this
is the first reported sorority incident of

alleged hazing in a long time.”

The university administration is in-
vestigating the report because hazing
is against university policy as well as
the policy of the National Panhellenic
Conference.

During a hazing investigation last.
November involving the Omega Psi
Phi fraternity, Smith told The Pitt News
that the university takes a strong stance
against hazing. “Hazing deﬁnitely goes
against the philosophies of education.
It is a deterrent of the retention of
students, and students cannot adequate-
ly perform their academic responsibil-
ities.” '

- Pitt’s Panhellenic Council also
abhors any form of hazing, according
to Panhel President Paige Allen.

NEA_Budget proposal  

“Any form of hazing is by no means
acceptable by our constitution, and all
members of the National Conference
have supported our stance with a
unanimous vote against hazing,” Allen
said. She added that any sorority found
guilty of hazing would lose its member-
ship in Panhel. '

The National Conference’s hazing
resolution states that: “All hazing
should be eliminated and pledge pro-
grams be directed toward the apprecia-
tion of the fraternity and the
understanding of the opportunities for
self-improvement that are offered for
the individual. 

Despite the hazing allegations and
Panhel's strong stance against hazing,
however, Allen said she hopes the
allegations are merely a misunderstand-
ing which can be worked out favorably.

“Alpha Kappa Alpha is a very ﬁne

-social and scholastic sorority which has

been quite active and supportive with
Panhel during my term as president,”
Allen said. “And to my knowledge,
they have a very strict hazing policy in
accordance with the university’s haz-
ing policy.”

In addition to Allen’s statements,
Alpha Kappa Alpha’s graduate advisor
and assistant advisor also defended the
sorority against the allegations.

“I feel the allegations are really un-
founded,” said Assistant Graduate Ad-
visor Marcia Jones. She declined to
comment further until she meets with
Smith.

Graduate Advisor Phyllis Valentine
said she believes the whole situation is
merely a personal problem. “The
pledge who reported the hazing is just
a problem person, I think. We have
seven other women on line [pledging]
who are very happy with the pledge
program, and they have no problems
with us, and we have no problems with
them.” ’i W 

‘reduces choices

“The administration claims to want
to make ‘choice’ the linchpin of its
educational policy,” Mary Hatwood
Futrell, president of the National
Education Association, told Congress
recently. “But its budget proposal
reduces to zero the choices available to
hundreds of thousands of children and
young adults.”

— The Reagan administration’s budget
proposal for ﬁscal year 1987, Futrell
pointed out, would exclude — by the
administration’s own count — some
250,000 disadvantaged students from
Chapter 1 compensatory education pro-
grams, 1.3 million college-age students
from ﬁnancial assistance programs, 12
million children from school lunch
assistance and 420,000 children from
school breakfast subsidies.

“These losses would accelerate an
unfortunate trend that has accompanied
this administration’s term in ofﬁce,”
Futrell told the House Budget Commit-

tee on Feb. 27, noting that since 1980,

for example, more than 1 million
students have been dropped from
Chapter 1 programs.

“For most of these children,”
Futrell stated, “lost opportunities can
never be regained.”

The administration’s proposed
changes in eligibility for both the col-
lege grant and loan programs are highly
unrealistic, Futrell added.

“For the Pell Grants, the adn1inistra-
tion is essentially telling us that only
families with an income under $23,000
could possibly need help in paying for
student’s college education,” she said.

Rising costs for college tuition, fees .

and other expenses make that assertion
extremely questionable, Futrell
explained.

Under President Reagan’s budget
proposal, funding for the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education would be reduced
to $15.2 billion -— $3.9 billion less than
the ﬁscal year 1985 appropriation level

Reagan has nuclear test plan

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan has put up to Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev what he called a
“very speciﬁc and far—reaching pro-
posal" to monitor nuclear tests. He said
it could be implemented immediately
and lead to ratiﬁcation of two treaties.
Reagan said in a written statement that
if the Soviets are willing to accept the
new veriﬁcation system, he will be
prepared to move forward on ratiﬁca-
tion of the Threshold Test Ban and the
Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty.

It was the latest round in a new ex-
change of arms proposals by the two
leaders. The Soviets announced a
moratorium on nuclear tests Thursday
and have asked Reagan to join them,
which he has refused to do. The Presi-
dent said a speciﬁc new technical
method, known as Corrtex, will enable
the United States and the Soviet Union
to improve veriﬁcation and ensure
compliance with the treaties.

The President invited the Kremlin to
send its scientists to a Nevada test site
next month to see and discuss the
method and to monitor a planned U.S.

nuclear weapons test. State Department
officials say the Corrtex system is not
new and is relatively simple. It has
been used for several years in the
United States for more than 100 tests.

Socialists behind
in French elections

PARIS — Early projections of the
National elections in France show
socialist President Francois Mitterand
behind his opponents. Results show
conservative parties taking a command-
ing lead in their drive to take control
of parliament, and to force Mitterand
to share power with an opposition
prime minister. The state—run French
television station projects the conser-
vative alliance of two parties. the Ral-
ly for the Republic and the Union for
French Democracy, will win 282 seats
in the 577 seat National Assembly.

With seven seats predicted to go to
smaller conservative parties the coali-
tion would have a working majority.

The television station predicts the rul-
ing socialists will win 212 seats and the
Communist party 37 seats. That would
be the once—powerful communists’
lowest showing ever in the Fifth
Republic.

The Interior Ministry reports voting
was light with only 64 percent of those
registered casting ballots. It blames the
turnout on polls that said a victory for
the right was a foregone conclusion.
Opinion polls predict the end result will
be a rejection of France’s ﬁve—year ex-
periment with socialism.

Democrats caution
Nicaraguan advisers

 

WASHINGTON — Democratic
House members warn against sending
any U.S. troops to advise the

Nicaraguan rebels. A Pentagon official
said some advisers might be sent.
Representative David Bonoir of
Michigan said the report means the
Nicaraguan situation is closer to
becoming “another Vietnam.” Robert
Mrazek of New York said the Contras
in Nicaragua lack the will to fight and
American advisers will eventually lead
the ﬁghting.

Ecuador captures
renegade general

Ecuador — Tank—led commando
squads have recaptured an air force
base taken over by a rebel general in
Ecuador. General Frank Vargas had
demanded the overthrow of President
Leon Febres Cordero since Vargas was
ousted as armed forces chief. Reporters
said tanks rolled into the base, followed
by 100 government commandos. The
attackers were met by intense sub-
machine gun fire that lasted 45
minutes.

There was no immediate report on
casualties or word on what had become
of Vargas. The general had earlier
declared that he would never leave the
base alive. Vargas had seized the air

Pro-Peace march
fizzles out early

LOS ANGELES — A peace march
that was to have gone from Los
Angeles to Washington is at the end of
the road after only 120 miles.
Organizers ran out of money in
Barstow, Calif., and had to send the
marchers home. Only 1,200 of the an-
ticipated 5,000 marchers started the
hike on March 1 in Los Angeles.

Pro-Peace, the group that set up the
march, ran into financial difficulties.
Early Friday it tried to raise $50,000
to buy another water truck and other
supplies needed to get across the desert
to Las Vegas, Nev. It then announced
it was abandoning the march and clos-
ing its Los Angeles office at the end
of the day. It said a new group, Great

Regan skeptical
about Marcos wealth

WASHINGTON W White House
Chief Of Staff Donald Regan said he
is skeptical of reports about the hidden
wealth of former Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos. Regan says he has
not seen any proof to back reports that
Marcos has $800 million in a Swiss
Bank account and extensive real estate
holdings in New York. Regan was
quoted as saying. “How he gets his
money or what he does with his money,
that‘s not up to me.“

However, Regan said if it is proven
that Marcos misused U.S. aid to the
Philippines during his 20-year rule. that
would be “something else again."
Regan said he understands that Mar-
cos is upset by his treatment since go-
ing into exile in Hawaii, but he said that
is the fault of the media, not the U.S.
government. Regan said, “The presi-
dent is still treating Mr. Marcos with
honor and dignity and will give him
safe haven.”

Reagan announces
new arms negotiator

WASHINGTON President
Reagan has named a new U.S.
negotiator for strategic nuclear arms.

 

“It’s real important for Americans
to become acquainted with the human
side of Latin America.” said Pinto.
“Maybe that will help them to make
wise decisions in policy."

Tony Tenicela. artistic director for
one of the dance ensembles, summed
up the opinion of many people when
he called the event “a great experience
for all the Latin Americans in Pitts-
burgh." .

Escort
Service Needed

A major portion of Pitt students live in off-
campus housing primarily because of the short-
age of space in university dormitories. Students
take up residence, sometimes unwillingly, in
apartments in surrounding neighborhoods that
are not always overly hospitable. In north and
south Oakland, and in Shadyside as well, mug-
gings and a variety of random, unprovoked
violent assaults against students occur with an
alarming regularity. The university is remiss
(especially in light of the dearth of available on-
campus housing) in that it has taken few
measures to protect its off—campus student
population from the sometimes harrowing
dangers of the streets.

Pitt administrators should take lessons from
their neighbors at CMU. An escort service, that
performs with an amazing alacrity, has been
established there to provide for the security of
students living off-campus. But the attitude of
officials at Pitt regarding the safety of off-
campus students seems to be one of “out of
sight, out of mind.”

Pitt administrators might demur when the sub-
ject of an escort service is broached, because
of the added cost it would impose on university
resources. They might stand behind the tenuous
argument that the present campus bus system
is sufficient for student security needs. But this
is patently untrue. In orderto properly ensure
the safety of students, a much more extensive
and frequent service is needed. The cost is easily
justified if it spares even one student the horror
of a beating in the streets. To continue to deny
this is to be guilty of negligence.

Primeval Pride

Suzanne Grieco’s logic in her arti-
cle, “Creed for the Unreligious,”
would be sound if the Creator had
simply thrown us into the world and
left us in the dark. But there is much
more to the human story. There came
a Man from God who professed to
teach us the truth that saves. He didn’t

' force anyone to accept it .—- and still

doesn’t. But He challenged everyone

who would hear him to repent and “
believe in.him, and invited us to our ‘

eternal destiny. He issues the same
challenge and invitation today, for
those who would hear.

The question is why is it that so many
do not hear, at that time and ever since?

‘Is it because believing in Him would

require changes in our lives? That’s
tough, so we ﬁnd many rationalizations
and distractions to avoid taking a long,
hard look at his message. ‘And one of
them is to say, it doesn’t matter what
you believe, since there isn’t any ob-
jective truth anyway. We are certainly
free to believe or reject what Christ
said, but what we aren’t free to do is
to believe that He said something other

than what He said. So we have to go’

to the source, if we are intellectually
honest. It’s the least we must do, if we
are to make a mature choice in the
matter.

Ms. Grieco fears organized religion,
since it tries to tell others what to do.
So did Christ, but He left us free. The
church is there as a medium to link us
with Christ, to hear His message as
Teacher and Savior, over a span of
2,000 years. That’s nothing to fear, if
we’re willing to look Him square in the
face.

The sophist said there is no truth -
man is the measure of all things, back
in the time of Socrates. Today he says,
I’m number one. When we’re trapped
in that spiritual pit, there’s little chance
the message of Christ will get through.
It’s the story of the primeval fall from
grace of our first parents all over again:
“I will not submit.”

I applaud the recent stand taken by
Speaker Leroy Irvis as reported in the
March 7 edition of The Pitt News.
While it is true that the Faculty
Assembly was the ﬁrst university
senate body to support divestment,
many faculty and staff groups, as well
as students, have shown their opposi-
tion to the board of trustee’s divestment
policies. Equipoise, the faculty section
of the Affirmative Action Committee,

cerns, the United Faculty, six hundred
staff and faculty signatories to a peti-

writing their request to President
Wesley Posvar and Chairman Robert
Kirby to show leadership and make the
only ethically correct decision: to divest
immediately. In addition, the Senate
Budget Policies Committee has asked
for the formation of a committee for
responsibility in investment. A small
number of people at the top, in failing
to show appropriate moral and social
behavior, are demonstrating extreme
insensitivity to the desires of a large
portion of the university community.

Is it a claim to food that oneis
hungry? Is the existence of need a
right to shelter? If not, one would
have to say that it is because the
claim to need exploits the producer,
making the producer unable to pro-
duce because the drain becomes too
great. Yet food supplies rot, rather
than go eaten, and populations rise
because of malnutrition and
understimulation. The consumer
smiles, smug and superior, while
the children of the dead are eaten
by ﬂies. I am serious. Millions of
children, this year alone, will be
eaten by ﬂies. This is a holocaust
of neglect. There is no truth to the
objectivist utilitarian assertion that
need is not a claim, that hunger is
not a justification for assistance.
Need is a claim if only because
need is finite but multiplies
geometrically when not abated, and
resources are sufﬁcient. There are
no excuses for a holocaust.

The Ritual Dissent/Jam
Save The Humans

There are many more living be-
ings to save than humans, so let’s
get quick on the job of tidying up
the civilized world and the human
race so that there is time to clean
up toxic wastes (arsenic in the sea,
nuclear’ wastes off the coasts of
ravaged England, dioxins in Pitts-
burgh) and re—forest the everglades,
save the micro organisms which
have medicinal value we haven’t
even discovered yet. And then
some. You tell me.

Belabor the point, because the
burden of proof has to be on peo-
ple who tell us otherwise. The
nature of reality is possibility, so
those nice, but unfortunately
dinderheadedv folks who claim that
reality is murderous, cruel, ig-
norant, probably simply make it
that way themselves, rather than
vice versa.

The government military in-
dustrial complex is gypping the

es M. Crary

world. The grip it holds on produc-
tive planning is wildly inap-
propriate, sinister in justification
and ﬂatly wrong.

Perhaps those who have been
claiming to lead the West should
start trying_ to lead us into a pro-
sperous vision, a world of ingenuity
and peace, of significant contribu-
tions to world peace, rather than
violence and confrontation. Perhaps
it is time for us, as Americans, to
outclass the Soviet Union with
magnanimity and charity.

Some people get angry when
asked to pay attention to the needs
of other cultures or when told that
the rhetoric they accept is ques-
tionable. Some people want to
maintain their superiority through
belligerence. These people believe
that might makes right and that
power allows no other way. It is
time they be proved wrong.

The Pitt News, March 17, 1986

We, The Outnumbered

I attacked a girl for creating a fic-
titious “we” to make herself impor-
tant. (She tacked her name onto an at-
titude I've been aiming at for a long
while. She was standing there when I
went off.) Now I shall create my own
ﬁctitious ‘ ‘we’ ’; not for the sake of be-
ing important but for the sake of being
fictitious, as we fiction writers often
tend to be.

I’ve read that five million American
girls dress like Madonna and that
Rocky IV was at the top of the box-
office grosser list. I’ve read that Ronald
Reagan is one of the more popular
presidents in U.S. history. I’ve read (in
a recent college catalogue) that the Pitt
campus has more social life than
academics. “However,” said one stu-

dent, “if your really look, you’ll find"

99

a hard—working minority. I read
things like this, and a picture begins to
form in my mind of my own fictitious
“we,” that out-of-place and confused
minority. Let me make myself clear.

Fact 1 about We, the Oumumbered:
We at least know when we are being

fictitious. We do not deny anything.

Fact 2: We do not know about each
other. “I wouldn’t want to belong to
any club that would have me as a
member,” said Groucho Marx.

Fact 3:“Every new idea is a
combination of two or more ideas
already conceived.” (Repeated
throughout a 1982 AP English text
called Montage. Sounds like a lift from
a philosophy course.)

Miscellaneous facts: We don’t care
who smokes.

We don't recognize Don Johnson’s
voice between commercials because we
have never seen “Miami Vice” all the
way through. We wonder what the fuss
is about. Therefore, we do not wear
white.

We don't know enough about foreign
policy, but we wish that we did. We
are able to regret our own ignorance.
“The fact that we regret justifies our
existence.” (Mark Miller, wherever he
is, during Intro. to Poetry, 1983.)

We know how to spell.

We do not believe we are any more

Innocence Or Indifference?

Among the causes to which Kurt
Waldheim has devoted his life, ignorance
is surely one. Asked to account for his
years as a Nazi soldier, he said he never
knew about the atrocities being commit-

ted around him. Asked how he could not, i

he answers that he still does not know.
For almost 45 years, the former U.N.
secretary general has pursued ignorance
as if it were truth. He thinks it will set
him free.

The charges against Waldheim are
several. The first is that he was an early
Nazi recruit. Not true, Waldheim says.
The second charge is that Waldheim
served both in Yugoslavia and Greece
under Gen. Alexander Lohr, who was
later executed as a war criminal. In
Yugoslavia, Lohr’s forces committed
atrocities. In Greece, they were respon-
sible for, among other things, the depor-

tation of 42,000 Jews from the city of
Salonika to extermination camps in
Poland.

To the last charge, Waldheim says not
guilty. He was merely a staff officer to
Lohr, an occasional translator, and not
only did he have nothing to do with the
expulsion of Jews, but he did not even
know about it. Confronted by the New
York Times, Waldheim confessed not just
innocence but ignorance as well.

It could be that he did notice. But what
could he do? He was a mere cog in a huge
killing machine — a soldier in the army,
not a race-hater in the SS, not a sadist
for the Gestapo torture chambers. Europe
was a vast chamel house and everywhere
the innocent were being murdered. To
admit casual complicity for what hap-
pened during the war is almost to earn
moral immunity now. What could one

unique to ourselves than others are u-
nique to themselves. We've never had
to give this much thought. “Anything
conceivable by the human mind can be
comparable to something else.” (Paoto
Pasolini, quoted by an editor of a ﬁlm
language book.) We know that
everyone must get everything from
somewhere. “You know I read it in a
magazi—ine  ” (Elton John, “Bennie
and the Jets.”)

We don’t listen to Madonna on pur-
pose. We wonder who these people are
who do.

We somehow do not qualify for
loans.

We do not scream in public.

Remember, “Every new idea is a
combination of two or more ideas
already Conceived.” (Montage, 1982)

We, for a fact, are embarrassed by
Sylvester Stallone:

The Soviet Union’s Literary
Gazette ’s U.S. correspondent wrote:
“Each time when Rambo killed
another so-called Red Monster, the
spectators jumped to their feet and

person do? What would you have done?

But the measure of the man can be
taken in his proclamation of ignorance.
Here is the self-confessed dumbbell in all
his glory — a person who boasts no
knowledge of history as if that frees him
from its consequences. In Waldheim’s
case, a great crime took place under his
nose and he smelled nothing. He was, he
insists, the three monkeys rolled into one.
Stop picking on him.

Even in the awful annals of the
Holocaust, tha saga of the Jews of Greece
is a special horror. It was a very long way
from Salonika to the killing camps of
Poland. The Jews of Salonika —— men and
women, children and the aged, the pious
and the cynical, the jaded and the roman-
tic — were put into trains and shipped
across Europe. The journey took days
and all this time the Jews of Salonika

raised the V-for-victory sign! The hall
was roaring for USA! USA! USA! And
I felt terrified. (The Newsday
Magazine, Dec. 29, 1985.)

We pray there are others like
ourselves. We are usually discouraged:

(1) Gallatin, Texas: 14-year-old Hal
Warden divorced his 17-year-old wife
Wendy. Said Wendy, “Hal acted like
a 40-year-old.” (The Newsday Maga-
zine. Dec. 29, 1985.)

(2) “Rambo's is the voice of
America that isn't loud enough.” (S.
Stallone, in a brief TV interview.)

We hear these things and we decide
that the world must be quite insane. We
become reluctant misanthropes. We
want to be alone solely to preserve our
own sanity.

We do not scream in public, although
we often. would like to.

We rarely cross the street at
crosswalks. When we do, we feel ill
at ease.

We are not so vain as to believe that
we are novel. “I am a cliche.” (Gregg
Bordowitz, Longwood H.S. [NY] class

Washington Post Writers Groug/ Richard Cohen

went without water or food, without
toilets or baths — in some case without
air to breathe. When the trains reached
the camps, many of the Jews were al-
ready dead. They suffered terrribly and
a Jewish community, 500 years old and

of ’82; probably stolen from a Lou
Reed song or a gift-store button.)
However, we believe this is forgivable.
“Well, we all must have our illusions.
God knows it would be difﬁcult to look
in the glass without them.” (Jean Rhys,
“Vienne,” Tigers Are Better looking. )
With this in mind, and only when this
is in mind, we think it still admirable
to try.
We’ve never understood why it is in
bad taste to mix_ silver and gold
jewelry.

We can admit we have not finished -

“Ulysses."

We sometimes grace ourselves to
think that we are misunderstood, but
this is a vice.

Post-facts: Some may have noticed
that I did not write half this article; yet
I call it my own. “A bad poet borrows,
a good poet steals." (T.S. Eliot.)

And it is my own. “Every new idea
is a combination of two or more ideas
already conceived.” (Montage, ’82)
No one is original. No one is
unoriginal. We do not deny anything.

But Waldheim says nothing haunted
him. He proclaims his innocence by con-
fessing ignorance. But what it really

. comes down to is indifference — an in-

advertent confession of guilt. It is what
made the Holocaust possible.

renowned throughout Europe, was no
more.

After the war, Kurt Waldheim became
a world leader. He is now running for the
presidency of _Austria. It is barely accept-
able for him to say he was oblivious to
mass murder when he was a junior of-
ficer; it is not acceptable for him to say
he spent a life that way. As a man and
as a political leader, it was his obligation
to ﬁnd out what happened during the war,
to see what, in his modest way, he made
possible —- to know and, in the telling
phrase of Arthur Koestler, ‘ ‘to be haunted
by his knowledge.”

Engineers let loose
for week of fun, games

By Douglas Bennett
Staff Writer

Last week, the Pitt campus was
ﬁlled with high-spiritedness and special
events as Pitt’s engineers were given
a chance to have fun and show depart-
mental pride during Engineers’ Week.

The festivities began last Sunday
with Open House. There were numer-
ous exhibits from each department as
well as keynote speaker Bill Sweet, of
the Carnegie-Mellon Software Design

Institute. Highlights of Sweet’s speech -

included the progress of construction
on the nearby facility.

Monday and Tuesday were high-
lighted by a blood drive, giving those
involved a chance to help patients in
need of blood while calling attention to

.the constant need for blood donors.

Early Wednesday morning, an ar-
rival parade through the streets of
Oakland ofﬁcially marked the begin-
ning of Engineers’ Week. Later in the
day, “Marathon Monopoly” began. A
test of endurance played on an enlarged
Monopoly board, the event ran from
noon to midnight. The day’s events
culminated with Game Night, when
each department designed a theme
room complete with entertainment and
games of chance. The electrical
engineering department created Castle
Benedum, ﬁlled with rat races, black-
jack and games of skill. Poker and live
entertainment were the highlights of
“A Modern Speakeasy” sponsored by
the civil engineers. Mechanical
engineering stepped back to the ’50s
with a record toss, bowling and clothes
of the era. Not to be out done, the
chemical engineering department re-
vived the ’60s, while the freshmen de-
vised a Revolutionary War theme.

All departmental classes were
cancelled Thursday and Friday. In-
stead, the Cathedral lawn was filled
with tug-of-war contests, obstacle
course races and an egg toss.

The festivities culminated Saturday

night with the Shamrock Ball when the '

overall achievement award was given
as well as individual event awards.

According to Debbie Blazewick, co-
chairperson of the Engineers’ Week
publicity committee, Engineers’ Week
has grown progressively larger since
its inception in 1954. Blazewick also
said the week’s events involved the
hard work and enthusiastic participa-
tion of nearly 2,000_people.

Which mid-70s supergroup featured
the talents of Don Henley and Glenn
Frey?

Who closed the 1984 Olympics in
song?

To which destination did the
Monkees take the “last train?”

If you answered The Eagles, Lionel
Richie, and Clarksville to the above
questions, then it’s our guess you
belong in the Zenith Data Systems
Rock ‘N’ Roll Trivia Tournament. The
tournament is an exciting new competi-
tion coming to the University of Pitts-
burgh on Tuesday, April 8 in the WPU
Assembly Room.

The Zenith Data Systems rock ‘n’
roll trivia competition is a one-day,

single-elimination tournament in which
16 teams will compete for prizes and
the chance to be Pitt’s ofﬁcial Rock ‘N’
Roll Trivia Champs. P

“The ZDS rock ‘n’ roll trivia com-
petition allows students to test their
rock ‘n’ roll knowledge and compete
for prizes, while giving both par-
ticipants and spectators the opportuni-
ty to learn more about the growing
world of computers,” said Marlene
Williamson, public relations manager
for Zenith Data Systems, noting that
Zenith Data Systems personal com-
puter display will be available for stu-
dent trial throughout the competition,
with students using the system to enter
Rock ‘n’ Roll Trivia Sweepstakes that
accompanies the competition. “Our
promotional efforts focus on the educa-
tional and entertaining beneﬁts of own-

ing and using a computer.”

Teams will consist of four players,
with questions covering the entire rock
‘n’ roll era from its 1950s roots to the
present rock ‘n’ roll boom. The faces
behind the sounds of the era will come
to life as audio and visual clips from
years past are presented throughout the
competition.

Team registration for the ZDS rock
‘n’ roll trivia competition will take
place through March 25 from 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m. , Monday through Friday, in
the Pitt Program Council office -
Room M30 in the William Pitt Union.
Competition begins at noon on April
8, with a series of 20-minute elimina-
tion matches culminating in the title
round at 8 p.m., a “super” match that
will feature two 30-minute halves.

able to provide these resources without
federal assistance. Futrell said. And
now. because of declines in manufac-
turing. agriculture and energy develop-
ment. many states will be unable to
raise new revenues to support pro-
grams that the Reagan administration’s
budget proposal would abandon.

The administrations proposal also
recommends a cut of $107 million in
handicapped education and a cut of $90
million in handicapped vocational
rehabilitation. This recommendation.
Futrell noted. runs counter to the ad-
ministration’s stated goal that "all
students should have an equal educa-
tional opportunity regardless of race.
national origin, color, sex or handicap-
capping condition."

The Department of Education’s
figures acknowledge that 30,0()0 more
handicapped students will need special
assistance in the 1986-87 school year
than in the 1985-86 school year, but
state and local governments are ex-
pected to provide the same level of ser-
vice to more students with a 6.5 per-
cent reduction in funds.

“Parents of handicapped children are
an excellent example of families that
do not have the choices of which the

 

administration speaks.” Futrell said.
"Most private schools do not accept
physically handicapped children, and
even if they did. no schools come close
to the quality of services provided
handicapped students in the public
schools. Education of the handicapped
is a moral and economic necessity for
this country. as is education for all
children. This proposal would provide
a measure of equity in that all would
suffer.“

There‘s a certain irony to the entire
budget proposal. Futrell told the House
paneL

“The Department of Education
points proudly to rising test scores in
college entrance exams, to higher
reading levels in other areas. to one
educational accomplishment after
another in every geographic area and
in all economic strata,” she said.

But this progress is the result of the
success of the very programs the ad-
ministration wants to reduce.

“With adequate federal support,”
Futrell concluded, “we can provide a
system of public education that is more
than adequate. We can provide ex-
cellence.”

OF COUNTERFEIT AUTO PARTS

INFERIOR PARTS COULD THREATEN YOUR SAFETY

Today, a counterfeiter
no longer has to print phony
twenty-dollar bills. Selling
imitation automotive replace-
ment parts—packaged to
resemble products from legit-
imate manufacturers—is big
business.

For people who buy
and use counterfeit auto
parts, though, the conse-
quences can be costly. For
example, body panels may
require expensive labor to
bring their finish quality up
to the rest of the car. Bogus
oil filters have failed after
200 miles, causing unpro-
tected engines to seize up,
requiring their complete
replacement.

Inferior transmission
fluid has solidified at 0°
Fahrenheit, ruining trans-
missions. And counterfeit
antifreeze has eaten right
through aluminum parts.

The failure can be
safety-related. A fatal 1985
bus accident in Britain was
attributed to the installation
of counterfeit brake parts. Ill-
fitting counterfeit gas caps
can fall off, increasing the
risk of a fire in a roll-over
accident.

Here’s how to make
sure you receive parts
that are made to work
best in your GM car. Your
most reliable source is your
GM dealer. He can supply
any part for your GM car or
truck. Buying popular brand
parts from reputable stores
or garages is another way
to improve your chances of
getting the right part. But

wherever you buy, be sus-

picious of discounts that
seem too good to be true.

Some tip-offs that a
part might be counterfeit:
Flimsy packaging.

Lack of name-brand
identification such as
AC-Delco.

“Look-alike” graphics or
a change in the spelling of a

recognized trade name. In ‘

this way counterfeiters can
avoid prosecution under the

1984 Trademark Counter-

feiting Law. So examine the
package carefully.

If a replacement part
doesn’t fit easily, you should

probably return it.-A repu-

table distributor will almost
certainly give you a refund
or credit.

General Motors is tak-

ing strong measures in the
U.S. and overseas to put a

stop to parts counter-

feiting. GM is trying to stop

the problem at its source.

 

So far we’ve helped U.S.
marshals confiscate parts in
raids on 29 counterfeiting
operations. Another eight
operations have been un-
covered and prosecuted in
foreign countries.

GM is also developing
a hologram identification
device, much like those be-
coming popular on credit
cards, to improve security
in our parts distribution.

After all, General
Motors has a tremendous
investment in GM parts that
work together to give our
customers safe, reliable cars
and trucks. We want our cus-
tomers to be confident they
can maintain their GM vehi-
cles at the same level of
high quality we build them.

This advertisement is part of
our continuing eﬂort to give
customers useful information
about their cars and trucks
and the company that builds
them.

The ﬂu season is upon us. For those
suffering from its symptoms, this lit-
tle fact is nothing new.

Inﬂuenza, or “the ﬂu,” is a con-

tagious disease caused by different
strains of viruses. Without complica-

tions, inﬂuenza is a moderately severe '

illness. Most people recover within a

V week to 10 days.

An important fact to remember about

‘ the ﬂu is that it does not improve with

treatment by penicillin or other an-
tibiotics. To receive a “penicillin shot”
for the ﬂu is to ask for a drug reaction,
risk a more serious “super infection”
and to waste time and money.

Most ﬂu symptoms are similar to
those of a cold, but with some definite
differences. The fever during illness
may be quite high, and headaches can
be severe. Muscle aches and pains,
especially lower back and eye muscles,
can be equally troublesome. Also, the
onset of the ﬂu may occur suddenly.
Cold symptoms may take two or three
days to develop. Other symptoms will
include a combination of the following:
chills, runny nose, stuffy or congested
ears, cough and weakness.

There is no magical cure for the ﬂu;
the only “cure” for inﬂuenza is the
human immune system. The immune
system can be aided by the following

recommendations which can be effec-
tive in relieving some of the discom-
fort you may experience. You can help
yourself by doing several of the
following:

1. Rest, relax and get plenty of sleep.

2. Drink plenty of ﬂuids — especial-
ly fruit juices and clear soups. This
means drinking at least 10-12 glasses
of liquid daily. And we’re not talking
beer here.

3. For relief of discomfort, take
aspirin or Tylenol. Two every four
hours may be used to relieve aches and
pains, and also reduce your fever.

4. Gargle to temporarily reduce sore
throat pain. The best solution is to use
one you make yourself. Use one tea-
spoon of salt mixed into eight ounces
of warm water, or if you don’t have
time, go to Thrift Drug.

5. Take decongestants for congestion
and/or runny nose. They might help
clear your nose, but decongestants
often have adverse side effects, such
as drowsiness or nervousness.

6. Cough. A cough serves a useful
purpose. If there is something in your
lungs or if there is ﬂuid dripping into
them, a cough will remove it. Inhaling

you want to use medication, choose an
expectorant for a productive cough (ex-
pelling mucus or phlegm). For a non-
productive cough (not bringing any-
thing up and irritating everyone around
you), use a cough suppressant or
antitussives.

7. If you smoke, stop or decrease
your cigarette intake, since smoking
will only aggravate your condition.

8. If you use a self-treatment plan,
be sure to follow medication directions
carefully. Treat only the symptoms you

an unusual or undesirable reaction oc-
curs from taking medication bought
without a prescription, stop taking it
right away. Remember: it is dangerous
to mix alcoholicbeverages with med-
ication, and-it is also dangerous to mix
several medications together.

If your ﬂu does not go away in a
reasonable span of time, consult a
physician. If you have a fever of 101
degrees or above for longer than two
or three days, or have hard coughing
spells, are coughing up thick greenish,
yellow or bloody sputum, have an
earache or severe headaches or facial
pain, go see a doctor.

The PittINews-, March l'7l,“'-1986 I

PIP director  

continued from page 1

the description to make it appear more
intellectual. ’ ’

With apologies, Caldwell rehired the
bewildered instructor of “Positively
Singular.” Caldwell said the instruc-
tor is one of several she has ﬁred and
rehired as a result of committee in-
decision.

Markel said that with its recent rash
of ﬁrings and rehirings, the PIP staff
has lost its credibility with PIP instruc-
tors. Caldwell and Boodwin said that
they are confused about how to per-
form their jobs.

Goodwin said she believes that the
PIP review committee’s philosophy is
“tight and provincial,” and that it
“confuse the daylight out of Ellen
[Caldwell]. ’ ’

Caldwell conﬁrmed Goodwin’s as-
sessment of the situation. “I am going
crazy,” said Caldwell. “I have no idea
what I am supposed to do.”

Besides disliking the committee’s
seemingly incoherent decision-making
policies, Markel, Goodwin and Cald-
well also said they think that ﬁnancially
and otherwise, PIP will be hurt by the
committee’s recommendations con-
cerning the staff and curriculum of PIP.

Markel said she is in sharp disagree-
ment with the recommendation that the
majority of PIP classes should be taught

 

by University of Pittsburgh professors.
Markel said she thinks this needlessly
ignores “the pool Iof talent” in
Pittsburgh.

Markel also said it was suggested to
her that Pitt faculty would be strongly
encouraged, if not forced, to teach at
PIP. ‘ ‘We want people who are excited
to teach for us,” said Markel, adding

that non-motivated teachers would

damage the PIP.

Another committee recommendation
that Markel and staff regard as un-
reasonable is the stipulation that all PIP
classes must be educational. Many PIP
classes are educational, such as as-
tronomy and the class on Homer’s
“Odyssey,” but others are not, Markel
said.

Because it is not an educational class,
aerobics has been cancelled, according
to Markel. Also, Oriental philosophy
will be introducd into the Hatha yoga
course and into the Chinese cooking
class to make them more “education-
al.” Markel said that Hatha yoga is
about exercise, and Chinese cooking is
about stir-frying —' neither one is about
philosophy. Markel also said that nei-
ther the teacher nor the pupils of the
Hatha yoga course want Oriental phi-
osophy in the class.

’ When_CGS Dean John Bolvin was

reached for comment on Markel’s

statements, he admitted that the com-
mittee has discussed various changes
for PIP courses, but he denied that his
committee has been overly indecisive
to PIP staff members. Regarding any
confusing signals from the PIP review
committee, “there haven’t been any, ’ ’
according to Bolvin.

Bolvin also defended the new em-
phasis on education at PIP. “We [Pitt]
offer to the community what we are, ”
said Bolvin, “and what we are Is an
educational university. ’ ’

Also, said Bolvin, PIP would not be
conﬁned to having only University of
Pittsburgh professors teach its courses.
Bolvin said that any non-university PIP
teachers would be interviewed by Pitt
professors, which is a change from the
old policy that gave PIP staff members
the power to interview and hire teach-
ers. Now, according to Bolvin, any
university outsiders “will have to be
ok’d by members of the faculty.”

Markel could not forsee PIP’s future.
She agreed with Goodwin’s statement
that if the present trend continues, PIP
will be “headed by non-creative peo-
ple who follow orders.”

“The community should demand
what they want,” Goodwin added.

“They should say, “We don’t like the ‘

new PIP; we want it back the way it

was .

Harpsichordist, organist to perform

The Renaissance and Baroque Socie-
ty of Pittsburgh presents Ton Koop-
man on March 24 at 8:30 p.m. In this
“Moveable Feast,” Koopman will ﬁrst
play the harpsichord at Synod Hall, and
at the intermission the audience will
join him in St. Paul’s Cathedral to

. finish the concert on the Cathedral’s

famous organ.

As soloist, conductor, recording art-
ist and scholar, Koopman’s reputation
is worldwide. His numerous awards
and achievements include the Prix
d’Excellence for both harpsichord and
and organ and a ﬁrst prize from the
prestigious International Competition
at Bruges, Belgium.

He has made dozens of recordings
from the baroque and classical eras, in-
cluding the complete Bach organ
works, the complete Handel organ con-'
certos and the complete works for
organ and harpsichord by Sweelinck.
High Fidelity magazine hailed his Bach
harpsichord concertos as “the best
available,"’ and The New York Times

called his 1985 recording of the -

Brandenburg concertos “one of the
year’s best.”

His Pittsburgh program features the
baroque repertoire on both harpsichord
and organ. It is these works for which

Koopman is most famous because of ,

his strikingly animated and original in-
terpretations. Included are works by
Bach, Buxtehude, Louis Couperin,
Francois Couperin and Sweelink.

The reputation which Koopman has
built up, internationally as well as in
the Netherlands, is based on impressive
musical personality with wide-ranging
interests directed towards the scientiﬁc
study of the available historical
sources. As a result of his research, he
has attained a unique understanding of
the old performance practices and is
able to put his knowledge of old ﬁnger-
ings and articulation, of organ registra-
tion and technique to use in his per-
formance. Koopman said he is con-
vinced that a thorough study must be
made of the period in which the music
was written in order to approach as
closely as possible the composer’s
intentions.

~ Ton Koopman

The concert is sponsered by The
Renaissance & Baroque Society of
Pittsburgh, the city’s only organization
devoted to the continued enjoyment of
early music. Concert tickets, which are
$10 ($7 for students), may be pur-
chased at the door or at the TIX booth.

CCDM‘s purposes are to improve the career awareness and employability of under-represented
minority college students (i.e.. American Indians. Black Americans and Hispanic Americans) and
to upgrade the career counseling and job referral services provided to those students.

Among the topics to be covered by the CORP program are: How Corporations Function; What
Corporations Seek When They Recruit; Preparing for Interviews: Using the Career Counseling and
Placement Service and the Employment Process; Communication Skills: Growing Professionally.
the Transition from Campus to Work; Business Environment: Dress, Etiquette. Ethics, etc,
Sophomore. under-represented minority students from any major field related to a career in business

Davis, Heyward in coach’s doghouse

The Pitt News, March 17, 1986

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

Two Pitt football players were
disciplined last week by head coach
Mike Gottfried, and another player
may be punished as soon as Friday.

Gottfried suspended freshman Brian
Davis and dismissed sophomore Tony
Williams from the team.

Craig “Iro’nhead” Heyward, who
missed the 1985 football season after
being placed on one-year probation
after apparently striking a Pitt student
with a crutch, was charged Friday by
the Pittsburgh Police with simple
assault and harassment. Heyward
allegedly was in an argument with a
12-year-old paper boy and pushed him
into bushes near his off-campus apart-
ment on Atwood Street in Oakland.

Davis, a Parade All-America run-
ning back at Washington High School,
has been suspended for the duration of
spring practice, which begins Friday
and runs until April 28. Gottfried said
Davis received the suspension for his
failure to attend classes and team
meetings.

“We’re only going to have one set
of rules,” Gottfried said. “We have a
structured program and we expect
everyone to be a part of that.”

Davis, who rushed for 298 yards in
an injury-plagued freshman season,
said his parents advised him not to
comment.

“I’m just suspended,” Davis said.

“In short,” said Linda Venzon,
Pitt’s assistant sports information direc-
tor, “[Davis] just has to get with the
program if he wants to represent Pitt
on the football field.”

Davis, who has been said by many
to be Pitt’s best back since Tony
Dorsett, has been rumored to be
transferring to Ohio State.

One Pitt football player who wished
to remain anonymous said, “Brian’s
not going to meetings because he’s out
of here. I-le’s definitely going to Ohio
State. We all know it.”

1% freshman Pat Santoro

Williams, a seldom used wide
receiver from Freedom, Pa., was
suspended from the university last Fri-
day after being involved in four cam-
pus altercations in a 12-month period.
He cannot take classes during the
spring and summer terms but can
reapply for admission in the fall.
Williams, however, is permanently off
the football team, said Gottfried.

“As a coach, you have a respon-
sibility to teach responsibility and
discipline — and that’s what’s expected
from everybody,” Gottfried said.
“Certainly, it’s not going to help us to
lose players, but we’re going to play
by the rules.”

Pitt Athletic Director Edward Bozik
has said he will stand by all decisions
Gottfried amends to discipline players’
wrongdoings.

Williams was Pitt’s second wide
receiver to be kicked off the team in
a month. Gottfried last month removed
wide receiver Dexter Hairston from the
team after campus altercations.

“I am aware of what he’s doing,”
said Bozik, “and he has my full sup-
port with what’s he doing.”

Heyward, a sophomore running back
from Passaic, N.J . who rushed for 539
yards as a freshman in 1984, was ex-
pected to carry much of the load in the
Pitt backﬁeld this season. The 6-0,
235-pounder’s one-year suspension had
ended, but after the incident with his
newspaper carrier, it’s up in the air
whether he’ll again don a Pitt uniform.
Heyward was accused by the boy’s
father on KDKA-TV as “constantly
picking on him.”

Heyward is scheduled to appear in
court this Friday at 9 a.m. before a

district magistrate. Gottfried said he

will await the outcome before deciding
whether to punish Heyward.

Bozik said Heyward’s status is en-
tirely up to Gottfried.

“On all matters of discipline with the
football team,” Bozik said, “Mike
Gottfried will take care of_ those mat-

ters. This is fully in the coach’s hand.” ' "fallback B1-lan avls

Chaz PalIa/ The Pitt News

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer ‘

Nothing seems to change in the sport
of collegiate wrestling. For the ninth
straight season, the University of Iowa
has won the NCAA wrestling cham-
pionship. The Hawkeyes achieved the
unprecedented feat in grand fashion by
capturing five of the 10 individual
championships, a new NCAA record.

However, there was one significant
difference at this year’s National tour-
nament for the University of Pitts-
burgh. The Panthers returned with two
wrestlers gaining All-America status.
Senior Kyle Nellis and freshman Pat
Santoro traveled along different roads
to Nationals, but the two Panthers
emerged with equally impressive
performances.

For Nellis, who finished eighth, it
has been a long four years in coming.
and finally his name can be mentioned
among the nation’s finest.

“My goal from the beginning of the
year,” said Nellis, “was to be an All-
America. It was fun, and I’m very
pleased how it went. It’s been a long
time in coming.”

Looking back at the four years Nellis

ilCjltazjIH’alla The Pitt News

dedicated himself to the Pitt wrestling
program, it certainly would seem that
Nellis’ time was due. But for Santoro,
the ﬁrst-year wrest1er’s career has got-
ten off to a very fast start. Santoro’s
33 victories are the most ever in a
season by a Pitt wrestler, and he has
become only the second Panther
freshman to gain All-America status.
Ironically, his coach, Rande Stot-
tlemyer, was the first back in 1974.

“He’s had a really great year,”
reﬂected Stottlemyer on the wrestler
he’ll have for three more seasons. “He
won over 30 matches and a major tour-
nament. Now he’s an All-America.”

The always shy and timid Santoro
seems to downplay his sixth-place
finish. Instead, he looks to others and
praises their accomplishments. In this
case, he acknowledges what Nellis has
done.

“I’m really happy that we both did
so well,” said Santoro. “_I’m especially
happy for Kyle. He has worked so hard
to get where he’s at. He’s meant so
much to this team.”

When the unassuming youngster
from Bethlehem, Pa., ﬁnally talked
about himself, he was already looking

The Sporting Life _  
Roy Campanella: A trendsetter

Editor ’s Note: The following is the ﬁrst
part of a two-part series on the
Dodgers’ Roy Campanella.

I wonder how it all started. I guess
nobody really knows for sure. What I
think happened is that on some rare
spring morning somewhere around the
turn of the century, a bit of Dodger
blue dropped from the azure sky and
landed on Bedford Avenue in
Brooklyn, N.Y.

From that street, in a ballpark called
Ebbet-’s Field, a legend bathed in blue
sprung eternal, fueling myths, legends,
facts and stories for generations to
come. For it was on Ebbet’s Field that
the Brooklyn Dodgers played baseball.

Brooklyn, 30 or 40 years ago, was
not separated as it is today by neigh-
borhoods of whites, blacks or Spanish.
Then the borough was segregated into
blocks of Irish-, Italian- or Jewish-
dominated streets. Blacks and Latin
Americans were only beginning in the
years after the war to make their way
across the bridge and out of the ghet-
tos of Harlem, Hell’s Kitchen or the
Lower East Side.

It was the ﬁnal incantation of the
Dodgers during the summers of ‘the
1950s that they achieved their greatest
glories and weaved their most likely tall

legends. These, as Roger Kahn dubbed
them in his classic book, were “The
Boys of Summer.” The team of Roy
Campanella and Pee Wee Reese, of
Carl Furillo and Billy Cox, of Jackie
Robinson. Yes, they were boys of sum-
mer, but more than that, they were men
for all seasons and all years.

Brooklyn has always been at the very
heart of the Great American Melting
Pot. Its ‘streets were the first ones
millions of immigrants saw in the new
world. These were the streets not
paved so much with gold, but with an
element even more worthy — hope.
Brooklyn was the starting point: it was
a step on the way, never a destination.
The end of the rainbow lay across the
bridge in Manhattan. But it was Brook-
lyn where the dreams began, and it was
Brooklyn where the dream of equality
began in earnest for black Americans.

In 1947, Branch Rickey, the Dodger
president, signed a kid named Jackie
Robinson to a pro contract, making
Robinson the first black ever to be

. allowed to play in the major leagues.

The repercussions of that signing
would echo through the coming dec-
ades in ways no one then thought
possible.

Rickey packed the snowball that
would roll into the avalanche of the

Civil Rights movement during the ‘

1950s and especially the 1960s. A tree
was not the only thing capable of grow-
ing in Brooklyn, for from there sprung
hope and pride. The pride which blacks
everywhere had in Jackie Robinson,
and the hope that Robinson was only
the first, was that equality was within
reach.

Robinson the man was himself in-
tensely proud and equally self-con-
scious. He seemed to many of them to

be aloof, arrogant. He was probably 

only too sensitive, too aware.

If there was an opposite to Jackie
Robinson on the Dodgers it was Roy
Campanella, the catcher. Where Rob-
inson. was loud, Campanella was a
quiet, gentle man. Campy was pro-
moted from the Montreal Royals to the
Dodgers in 1948. That move made him
the first black catcher in baseball, and
the following year, when Don New-
combe was on the mound for the Dod-
gers, he was one-half of baseball’s first
all-black battery.

In a recent interview with The Pitt
News, Campanella spoke of his life, his
career in baseball and the discrimina-
tion he faced. In the second part of this
column appearing Wednesday, Roy
Campanella’s story will be told in his
own words. -

Upset victory over Syracuse adds  
value to Navy coach Evans stock

Some thoughts from a slow sports
weekend: A

0 Navy head coach Paul Evans in-
terviewed for the Pitt basketball head
coaching job last week. I’m sure that
by virtue of Navy’s upset win over
Syracuse yesterday, half of Pittsburgh
will be screaming for Pitt to hire Evans
as the successor to Roy Chipman.

0 One thing that you have to give
Navy credit for is the fact that every
player on that team knows who he
wants to get the ball to — 6-10 center
Dave Robinson. There is no confusion
about who the “take charge guy” is on
Navy’s team. When the Midshipmen
are holding for a last shot, you will not
see their off-guard or small forward
force up a jump shot. It is a shame that
we did not see the same thing with Pitt
and Charles Smith this past year.

’ 0 Within the last year, the Pitt foot-
ball program has chipped away at the
reputation of the University of Pitts-
burgh. It all started when running back
Craig Heyward was suspended for
allegedly striking another student with
a crutch. He received one-year
disciplinary probation and sat out last
year. Pitt looked bad.

_ Heyward is back in the news again.
This time for allegedly assaulting a
12-year-old paper boy. Now I can see

getting a little upset if your morning
paper is not there when you are ready
for your first cup of coffee, but this is
getting a little ridiculous. To make mat-
ters even worse, the word is that
Heyward did not even give the paper
boy a tip.

Jim Urban

On a more serious note, the big ques-
tion at last year’s fall camp was what
would happen to Heyward when he
came back to the team? Would he back
up Tom Brown? Would he beat out
Tom Brown? Now the question seems
to be: Will he ever play at Pitt again?
The answer, to come this week from
Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried, will
probably be “No!” If it is not,

somebody better step in and overrule 9

it. Pitt already looks worse for not ex-
pelling him in the ﬁrst place.

Next item: Earlier this year, John
Wolfe, a Monaca High School football
standout, spoke out in the Pittsburgh
Post Gazette against Pitt’s recruiting
tactics. He said that when Pitt assistant
coach Sal Sunseri recruited him, all
Sunseri talked about was football.
There was very little mentioned about
the school itself.

Wolfe eventually signed with Penn
State, saying he wanted to get a good
education. Pitt looks bad again.

Now, Tony Williams, a 6-7 wide

1 receiver who never played a down as

a Pitt Panther, joins Dexter Hairston

as the second receiver to be kicked off ‘

the team this year. Williams had four
campus altercations in a 12-month
period. Pitt looks bad '— one more
time.

0 The Big East has taken a beating
in the NCAA Tournament. Last year,
it was a “Big East Feast.” This year,
it has been a “Feast on the Big East.”

0 For those of you who claimed that
Chipman was the worst coach in the

Big East, try this one on for size. The

worst coach in the Big East is Jim
Boeheim of Syracuse.

The Orangemen have four potential
high NBA draft picks in their line-up,
Dwayne Washington, Rafael Addison,
Wendell Alexis and Rony Seikaly.
Their fifth starter, Howard Triche, is
not too bad himself. How, then, did
Syracuse fail to win the Big East Cham-
pionship? How did it lose by one point
to St. John’s, a three-man team, in the
Big East Tournament final? And how
did it lose to Navy yesterday afternoon
at the Carrier Dome? Call it poor
coaching.

Lousy Pittseason not such a big surprise

By John Enright
Staff Writer

It was a very disappointing season
for the Pitt Panther basketball team.
To say that the Panthers fell below their
expectations is truly a great under-
statement.

A season ﬁlled with so much prom-
ise ended in turmoil and total disarray.
But the Pitt fans, the’ media and
especially the Panther players should
not be surprised at what transpired this
winter. There were numerous factors,
at least in this writer’s view, which
made Pitt’s mediocre season far from
a surprising occurrence.

For one, and I know this has been
pointed out many times, there was the
lame-duck status of former head coach
Roy Chipman. When Chipman an-
nounced his resignation (effective at the
endof the season) on Dec. 18 amid
alleged recruiting wrongdoings, his
players used it as a motivational force.
Immediately following Chipman’s res-
ignation, Pitt got hot. The Panthers
won four consecutive games, defeating
Florida State, winning the Sugar Bowl
tournament and beating Georgetown
before bowing to St. John’s in overtime
on the road. ,

The Panthers were 9-3, and although
they weren’t playing great basketball,
they were winning. Pitt continued to

win, improving its record to 13-5 as
they prepared for the rematch with St.
John’s on Jan. 25 at Fitzgerald Field
House.

Pitt looked like worldbeaters, con-
trolling the ﬁrst-half of action and
stretching its lead to 14 points early in
the second half. But Charles Smith

John Enright

picked up his fourth foul with 17 min-
utes left and from that point on it was
to be all down hill the rest of the game
and, consequently, the rest of the sea-
son for the Panthers.

With Smith on the bench, “The
Truth,” Walter Berry, took over,
leading St. John’s to a comeback 68-67
win.

A Panther victory in that nationally
televised contest would have undoubt-
edly vaulted Pitt into the national Top
20 rankings, something they haven’t
done in over 10 years. The Panthers
had come so close to Top 20 recogni-
tion and, sadly, ended the season far
away from this lofty position.

What transpired after the St. John’s
game was quite simple: The Panthers
quit — they simply keeled over and

died. But it was easy to quit. Their
coach quit so why couldn’t they?

Everyone has their own opinions as
to why ‘Pitt finished the year on such
a down note, but the main reason was
the St. John’s loss at home. That heart-
breaking loss totally demoralized the
Pitt team.

Naturally, there are many other
reasons why the Panthers fell apart.
For one, people overestimate Pitt’s
talent. I don’t mean to say that Pitt
doesn’t have Top 20 talent. Indeed they
do, but you don’t win Big East basket-
ball games with one quality big man —
Smith.

Forward Demetreus Gore, 6-5 ‘/2,
isn’t a big man. He still gets his points
the same way he did playing off-guard
his freshman season: jumpshots, break-
away slams and in-the-lane jumpers.
Gore hasn’t added much to the Panthers
rebounding attack, one of the biggest
weaknesses on the team.

The Panthers possess a truly great
athlete in 6-6 Jerome Lane, who, given
the opportunity, would give Pitt anoth-
er bonaﬁde “big” player. But Lane has
been on the bench for the majority of
the Big East season, instead of on the
court at small forward where he
belongs.

Lane would be, in the true sense of
the term, a small forward. He would
bang the boards and pull down numer-
ous offensive rebounds, causing havoc

for Pitt opponents.

If the Panthers are to be a successful
team next year, Curtis Aiken must go
to the bench. Aiken is a superior shoot-
er and a solid ball handler who im-
proved tremendously this past season.
But Aiken has also shown in three years
that he is definitely not a point guard.

Therefore, Lane should start at small
forward with Gore moving back to his
natural off-guard spot. Along with
Smith (if he regains the form of his
freshman year), Pitt would have three
“supers” in the lineup, and Aiken
would still get 20-25 minutes a game
backing up 6-3 Mike Goodson, who
should start at the point, and Gore.

Aiken will be a senior next season.
If his ego can handle the enormous
strain of not starting, the Panthers
could possibly be as good in 1986-87
as they were bad this year. If Aiken
doesn’t respond well to a new role as
the sixth man, Pitt will suffer through
another disappointing season, no mat-
ter who the new coach is.

Speaking of the new coach, who will
it be? My sources indicate that George
Karl, a Penn Hills native and the head
coach of the NBA Cleveland Cavaliers,
is the leading candidate to replace
Chipman. Paul Evans, the head coach
of the Naval Academy, has also re-
ceived a good deal of consideration.

Both are proven winners and funda-

Pa'ge"7l 3*’

mentally sound coaches, but a little bir-
die has indicated to me that Karl will
get the job.

The new coach will certainly have
some nice players to work with, but his
major task will be installing a sense of
pride and determination in the ‘players,
something they completely lacked this
season.

He will also have to massage some
egos. That is, he will have to tell these
“Parade All-Americas” that they are
simply not as good as they think they
are. The Panther players seemed to
continue to have cocky “I can do it
all” attitudes as each loss mounted.

The Panthers also have to learn.that
there is no “I” in team. The word
discipline is nonexistent in all the
player’s vocabularies. Pitt’s idea of a
fastbreak is for one player to take the
ball to the hoop and have.everybody
else crash the boards. I can’t remember
the last time I watched Pitt run a bor-

ing, fundamental but successful fast- ‘

break.

If the new coach can correct some
of these seemingly insurmountable
problems, the Panthers could maybe,
just maybe, turn it around next year.

But the word “if” itself is the ma-
jor problem. Pitt will enter-the 1986-87
campaign with too many “ifs.” The
Panthers will most likely be a ﬁfth-
place or possibly fourth-place pre-
season selection in the league. I

Pieters adjusts to a successful career

By Mike Ryan
For The Pitt News

Kristy Pieters. a senior on the
University of_ Pittsburgh’s women’s
gymnastics team, had to overcome
many obstacles after her freshman
season to have a successful college
career.

The former standout at George
Rogers Clark High in Whiting, Ind.,
is pleased that she chose to attend Pitt
nearly four years ago.

Now, the co-captain is a two-time
All-East performer and happy with her
status as a true student athlete.
However, Pieters had to make some
adjustments when she first came to
Pittsburgh. She had lived only a short
walking distance from Lake Michigan
where she swam and got a suntan.

“Where I live, people lay out on the
beach to get a suntan,” said Pieters.
“In Pittsburgh, people lay out on the
grass. I can remember the very first
time I laid out on the grass to get a sun-
tan and I looked around at other peo-
ple to see if I was doing it right,”
Pieters said with her never-ending
smile.

The second adjustment she had to
make was getting used to the hills in
Pittsburgh. Indiana is mostly ﬂat.
There are no steep hills like there are
in Pittsburgh. Most people complain
about walking up hills like “Cardiac
Hill” which connects the lower cam-
pus to Trees Hall where the gymnasts
practice. Pieters does not rriind the hills
at all. “I love these hills. I enjoy walk-
ing up them every day to practice,”
said Pieters.

The other adjustments Pieters had to
make were_more physical. As a fresh-
man, she tore ligaments and tendons in
her right knee that required an opera-
tion. She also had to adaptto the strict

weight requirements that are necessary
on the collegiate level.

The third adjustment dealt with
Pieters handling the rigorous schedule
of combining both academics and col-
lege athletics. “I had trouble transfer-
ring from a private club to a universi-
ty, ” said Pieters. Due to these circum-
stances and being unhappy with her
original major at the time, Pieters’
grades were not up to her standards.
These difficulties hurt her confidence.

By the time her sophomore year
rolled around, no one would have
blamed Pieters if she had given up. But
that is not Kristy Pieters. Those around
Pieters know her only as one thing —
a winner. Donna Sanft, therwomen’s
gymnastics head coach at Pitt, knows

how true this is.

“Kristy is a real aggressive all-out
type person,” Sanft said. “She does
not second-guess anything. Kristy goes
out and does the best she can. She is
pleased when she does well and, if she
does not do well, Kristy knows that she
will do better the next time.”

There was one major reason
everything started to change for the bet-
ter. This was due to her boyfriend, Jim
Shriver. -

Shriver, a graduate from the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, was a lineman on the
football team. “He made me work
harder during practice and reminded
me how much I loved [gymnastics],”
said Pieters.

Pieters, therefore, lost weight and
gained confidence. She was named the
team’s Most Valuable Player as a
junior. Against New Hampshire this
season, she ﬁnished first in the all-
around with a total score of 35.75.

Her grades also have gone up. She
changed her major to business and now
her QPA is above a 3.2.

Pieters’ gymnastics career will come
to an end after this year, but there is
little doubt that her success will con-
tinue. “Kristy has what it takes to be
successful,” said Sanft.

“With her personality and com-
petitive attitude, Kristy also will be a
success in life.”

to next season.

"It’s_ a really exciting feeling." San-
toro said. “I’m going to relax for a lit-
tle bit, but I‘m not burned out. I have
to get ready for next year.

“I saw some great wrestlers lose this
weekend. I have to keep getting
stronger to get back there. But it does
feel good.”

The impressive showing by Nellis
and Santoro indeed has put Pitt’s name
among the nation’s best. By virtue of
their performances, Pitt finished in
25th place. It certainly wasn’t a bad
way to cap off their finest season since
1979.

“This certainly improves the prestige
of the program,” said Nellis. “We had
a really good year with a 9-3-2 record
and two All-Americas.”

“We went out with two guys and
came back with two All-Americas,”

i<age_ -1 D.»

with it."

As for the two new Pitt All—
Americas, the coach speaks very highly
of both. “Pat's a tremendous person.
and he isn’t done yet. He’ll be there for
the next three years.

“This was the big chance for Kyle,
and he didn’t let it slip by. He had one
chance to prove himself, and he did it.
It’s quite appropriate that Kyle Nellis
is called an All—America.”

While Pitt was making the most of
their trip to the Midwest, other con— .
ference members did not. Clarion, the -.
nation’s No. 3—ranked team, sent eight
wrestlers and returned with no one
figuring in the money. Like Pitt, both
Penn State and Bloomsburg had two
All-Americas, though each had sent
more representatives. Rocky Bonomo
of Bloomsburg won his second con-
secutive championship at 118 pounds,
and for the second straight season .
