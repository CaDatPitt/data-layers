SG Introduces Bill to ]oin

ACT Entertainment Agency

Student Government (SG) plans to take an active part in ob-
taining quality entertainment for University functions. At Wednes-
day night’s meeting, Senator Bil-l Ralph introduced a bill to affili-
ate with Associated Campus Talent (ACT) which will facilitate
booking of top entertainment groups.

ACT is a new organimtion and has a membership of approxi-
mately 50 schools. It' works with blocks of universities and colleges
in order to get a single entertainer or a group into one area and
appear at schools -in the area on consecutive nights. At present,
there is only one tri-state area school in ACT, but Senator Ralph
hopes that the University would initiate membership among the
nearby institwtions. ‘

He proposed to leave the choice of entertainment up to a three
man board including the Student Union Board director, a member
of the Student Union Board and a SG senator. The bill was tabled
in order to work out some ﬁne details, and it will come up again
at the next‘ meeting.

The only other bill discussed concerned the Associated Student
Governments (ASG) organization. After several weeks’ discussion,
it was finally decided to include the ASG on the referendum that

now involves the National Student’ Association.
The referendum will appear in next week's SG voting. It will

give a chance for students to
give their opinions on whether
to aiﬁliate with NSA, ASG, both
or neither. The new SG Senate
will then take action according-
ly.
The remainder of the meeting
was used for various commit-
tee reports. Several committees
presented recent accomplish-
ments and gave suggestions for
the. upcoming senate. Most no-
table was the Book Exchange
Committee. Senator Mia Rose-n

‘reported that the committee ob-

tained about 2,000 books at the
end of last term and sold a lit-
tle over 1,000 at a sale that end-
ed Wednesday. '

President Ken Frederick an-
nounced‘ that there will be an
award for the outstanding sena-
tor at the next meeting, the pre-
sent senate’-s last. Voting for
the award was held at Wednes-
day’s meeting.

  Adds Kociubes in Spat

Over Qualifications
by DAN BOOKER

In a campaign already marked by surprise moves, Ar-
mand Belly, independent candidate for Student Govern-
ment (SG) president, announced Wednesday that Joe
Kociubes would replace Ken Holecko as his running mate.
Belly said that the switch was made to allow him to “re-
main on the ballot and continue his attempt to abolish
Student Government.”

In a -statement prepared for the press, Belly charged that
SG President and Chairman of the Elections Cornmirttee Ken Fred-
erick planned to use a technicality about Holecko-’s eligibility as
an “excuse to keep me off the ballot.”

Holecko withdrew from school last term to undergo an opera-
tion. Under the election code requirements that vice-presidential
candidates must "have registered as a full-time student at the
Oakland campus for at least one of the two consecutive trimesters
immediately preceding his or her election to office,” Holecko may

have been deemed ineligible by the SG Elections Cloormnittee.

Warwick Cancels Concert

Dionne Warwick, originally
scheduled to give a Student
Union concert Feb. 3 has can-
celed the engagement in order
to make a television guest ap-
pearance in San Remo, Italy.

Although the University had
Ia signed contract with Dionne
Warwick, the contract contain-

ed a 30 day cancellation clause. .

This clause is standard, and en-

ables an entertainer to cancel
an engagement 30 days or more
‘before the scheduled appear-
ance.

Miss Warwick’ has also can-
celed concerts at West Point,

least thats what the balding man
says what he means is up to
the crowd. The crowd takes it
as facetious, and laugh some
more. The little man goes on.

“I don't know if Johnson had

a sen-se of humor when he first
assumed oﬁ"ice, so I decided to
ﬁnd out. So\I Wrote a column
about J ohnson’s poverty d.-rive-
yoc- know —— turning out the
lights and all that, and it was
published in the papers. When
Johnson saw it, he was down on
the ranch. The article was pass-
ed around a big table where all
his aides were sitting. They all
1-aughed. Then it got around the
table to Johnson. He didn’t
laugh. So everyone asked to see
it again. 'l‘he second time, no-

In fact he knows several, or, at
least, he has an opinion about
a couple. “For my purposes
which are strictly humor, I still
like Nixon —- he's a barrel of

are hardly worth mentioning.
“The question is not whether
Rockefeller is backing Romney,
but whether Romney will back
Rockefeller.

However, he didn’t think that
the blame for losing the elec-
tions could be placed entirely at
the Republican's feet. “The press
wasn't fair to Goldwater; we
quoted him.”

This is not to say that the lit-
tle man did not have contact
with Goldwater on a personal
level; he did. “When Goldwater
was charging that our missiles
were no good, I proposed a lit-

out to the middle of the Paciﬁc
Ocean in a rowboat, and Mc-
Namara would aim a missle at
him.

“If it hit, Goldwater would
have to apologize. If it missed,
McNamara would have to im-

I got was from McNamara. He
said, ‘I'll do it." Then Barry
Goldwater called and said, ‘I

Listens to questioner after speech.
The problem with this partl-
cular man is’ that he is some-
times taken seriously by the
right people at the wrong time,
and by the wrong people at the
right time. “Once, in 1958 when
Eisenhower was in Europe, he
got sick. So naturally Press Sec-
retary Hagen-ty’s news confer-
ence spent a lot of time talking
about trivial details of the Pros-
ident's health. The whole thing
was getting a. little ludicrous
when I decided to do a column
spooﬁng lIagerty’s conferences.
“However, it sounded somuch
like the real thing that Hager-
ty called a Press conference to
deny it. . . . This upset the Pres-
ident so much that he called in
Hagerty and told him ‘Simmer
down Jim, simmer down.’ This
was the last forrthri-ght thing
that Eisenhower ever did.”
Imagine a small man present-
ing a ﬁgure not  that of
a walrus, tired after half an
hour of speaking. He's talked
about the draft; he's talked
about Eisenhower; he's talked
about Johnson. People have
laughed, most of them hard.
He's said that he hopes that be-
hind his humor, people will see
what he is trying to say. The
hour is late, studying has to be

swered: “Mr. Buchwald, are you
planning a new book?"
“Yes. I'm calling it Have I

Because election petitions were
due Wednesday and the Elec-
tions Committee didn’t meet un-
til last night, Belly said he would
not have been able to get a. re-
placement for Holecko.

When notiﬁed of Belly’s dhlarge,
Frederick said that the question
of Hollecko’s elgibility had been
raised by one of the competing
parties. Frederick explained that
SG Vice~president Tom Meisner

I had consulted James Wolf, as-

sistant secretary of the Univer-
sity and an attorney, tor an
opinion on the  “He
(Wolf) said that we would have
to go by what Student Records
said,” added Frederick.

“They (Belly and his support-
ers) ought to know when they

are running someone if he is-

qualirlied,” he continued.
Ken Schueler, opponent of Bel-

ly -on the Positive Action Team I A

(PAT) ticket, maintained, ‘'1 did
not initiate the probe as to 1101-
ecko’s eligibility, but if the ques-
tion were raised and not inves-
tigated, Frederick would have
been charged with favoritism to-
wards Belly. I have heard many
comments about IIolecko’s qual-
iﬁcations.”

Belly later heightened his at-
tack on Frederick. “It looks like
Frederick is working with
Sch-ueler in violation of his neu-
trality,” he charged. “I wouldn't
want to say that directly yet. I
plan to release a statement Fri-
day after studying the issue.”

S-chueler answered, “My rela-
tionship to Mei.-sner and Freder-
ick is sollely of an inforrnaltive
‘nature. I haven't been involved
in Student Govermnent, and so
I went to the People who were.
I am not going to elicit support
from them.

“If Belly can suspect Freder-
ick," continued Schueler, “the
situation could also lead me to
believe that he (Belly) knew of
lIolecko’s ineligibility and that
it was all part of a political
move.” '

Belly admitted that he had
orwiginarlly wanted Kociubes, a
Liberal Arts junior, to run with
him, but had been refused be-
cause Kociubes “felt he had a
lot of school work to do.”

Summer Institute Hosts
Mathematics Teachers

The University will host an
institute for teachers of high
school mathematics next sum-
mer. I

The objective of the sunnmer
institute, to be held from June
24 to Aug. 2, is to improve the
subject-matter competence of
the participating teachers, to
strengthen their capacity to mo-
tivate students to consider ca-
reers in mathematics, and to
stimulate their interest and in-
crease their prestige by person-
al Contact with competent sci-
entists.

The institute will consist of
two three-credit courses and

two problem sessions in mathe-

 

martics. These courses will be
open only to teachers participat-

ing in the institute. All courses
will carry regular academic cred-

it and be accepted in partial ful-~

ﬁllment of the requirements for
a Master in Education degree.

Applicants for admission to
the institute must be teaching
high school mathematics at the
present time and must have
taught mathematics for at least
three years. Candidates will be
considered on the basis of their
ability to beneﬁt from the pro-

gram.

After you've met

the challenge?

If you're the kind of Civil Engineer
we're looking for, you'll start search-
ing for another one to conquer. Here
at the Pennsylvania Department of
Highways, we offer a host of chal-
Ienges to the right man. But, to be
that right man,you’ve got to be pretty-

special.

You see, we search out and encour-
age Civil Engineers whom we consider
capable of grasping a challenge;
skilled men, comparable to the great
Engineers who are "building Tomor-
row today in Pennsylvania." If you
can measure up to the standards
necessary to fulfill Pennsylvania's $10
billion plan to lead the nation in high-
ways, we’d consider it a challenge just

to get to know you.

A Pennsylvania Department of
Highways Career Representative will
visit your campus. To arrange for an
appointment, or if you desire

additional infor-

mation, contact the

placement office.

AT 6:30 AM., these Pittsburghers turned out at the downtown
Federal Buildings to support draft protestor Ted Marsh.

Large Crowd Protests
Marsh Army Induction

by IVAN ABRAMS
At 6:30 in the morning Tuesday, some 120 people
gathered in front of the Federal Building to protest the
induction of Ted Marsh into the Army. Marsh, one of the
eleven men who turned in their draft cards at Pittsburgh’s
Resistance Ceremony reported to the i.nduction center but

within the next week.

Unlike incidents in other cities,
the Pittsburgh demonstration
proceeded withouzt troulble. Al-
though a veritable cover of po-
lice had been ordered to the
scene, there seemed to be little
tension and the police spent
most of the time in their pa-
trol cars trying to avoid the
three degree gloom.

Msgr. Charles Owen Rice of
the Holy Rosary Clhurch gave a

‘ short address at 8:15 a.m. re-

minding the demonstrators that
Marsh was not alone i-n the
struggle. He also called upon
the group to support Dr. Ben-
jarnin Spock and the four other
men recently charged with vio-
lation of the Selective Service
and Conspiracy Laws.

As the sun -came up, the
street in front of the Federal
building became crowded with
cars stop-ping as their drivers
-gaped in curiosity at the slowly
marching throng. At this time a
few of the demonstrators left
for their jobs, but they were
quickly replaced by late arrivals
who continued to wander in un-
til about 8 a.m. ‘

  Endowment

Supports
Research

A Professorship in Environ-
mental
engineering pioneer Dr. Edward
R. Weidlein will be established

at the University with funds re- ’

cently contributed by Lt. Gener-
val Richard K. Mellon and Mrs.
Mellon. The endowment will also
be used to support -research and
teaching programs in this new
ﬁeld. '

Dr. We-idlein has been asso-
ciated with the University for a
number of years. He has pro-
vided leadership and counsel to
the Engineering School and has
served as an emeritus trustee.
He served as director and then
president o-f the Mellon Institute
from 1931 to 1956.

The formation of an Environ-
mental Engineering Department
will provide a focal point for a
number of teaching and research
programs in engineering affect-
ing the human environment,
such as bio-medical engineering,
water resources and water man-
agement, and urban and public

The reaction of prasserbys on
Liberty Ave. to demonstration
was mixed. Some said, “They
should all be drafted,” thus un-
derscoring the psuzbli/c’s view of
the draft as a punishment. Other
pedestrians, however, expressed
approval of the group, while
the m-ajority just bowed their
heads
«through the line.

By 8:30 a.m. the group had
dwindled to about 50 persons,
and it was at this time that
KQV-radio made an appearance.
KDKA-TV and KDKA-radio,
however, had arrived with the
the ﬁrst of the group at 6:30,
and reports from these two sta-
tions indicated an accurate count
of the participants.

and walked rapidly

(CPS ) ~Dem onstrators against
-the war and the draft gathered
in several major cities last week
(Jan. 5-12) to dramatize their
support for the ﬁve men who
were indicted by a federal grand
jury for encouraging non-coop-
eration with the Selective Serv-
ice System.

‘Most of the demonstraltions
were relatively small but alto-
gether hundreds of persons
lbraved sub-freezing tempera-
tures to condemn the Johnson
Administration, and speciﬁcally
the Justice Department, for ob-
ntaining the indictment against
the ﬁve men. The demonstra-
tions were called by Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS).

The indictment was returned
Juan. 5 by a federal grand jury
in Boston. The men—pediaJtrici-
an Dr. Benjamin Spock, Yale
University C h a plain William
Sloan Coffin, former White
House aide Marcus Rlaslcin, au- ~
thor Mitchell Go-odmlan, and
Harvard graduate student Mich-
ael Ferber—were indicted for
their efforts to “counsel, aid,
and abe ” young people to evade
the draft.

The major demonstration oc-
curred Friday in Washington,
where about 150 persons march-
ed on the Justice Department,
saying the recent indictment
proves there is no “true jus-
tice.” Protesters handed out leaf-
lets which said, “While the De-
partment of ‘Defense’ pursues
its aggressive war in Vietnam,
the Department of ‘Justice’ in-
dicts not the warmakers, b11t
those who seek an end to war
and racism.”

Eight pers-on-s were permitted
«to enter the Justice Department
to explain their views to a rep-

resentative of Attorney General
Ramsey Clark. Four of the
young people left their draft
cards with the representative,
who said he could not legally
accept the cards, but would turn
them over to the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation. A ﬁfth

Anti-War and Draft Marchers

Demonstrate In Major Cities

~person—<a 33-year-old professor
at the University o-f Maryland—
left a letter of intention to mail
in his card. John McAuliff, one
of the four who turned in his
draft card, said the Justice De-
partment official would not de-
bate the issues, but merely lis-
tened to what the eight protest-
ers had to say.

After the Justice Department
demonstration, the protesters
went to Western High School
in Washington's fashionable
Georgetown section to continue
their protest, despite the 15-de-
gree temperature. As high school
students left the building for
home, the demonstrators hand-
ed out draft information leaﬂets
and spoke against the war and
the draft through microphones.

Several pr-o-war students en-
gaged in debates with some of
the demonstraltors, but the ma-
jority o.f students left school as
if nothing was hlalplpening. Small
groups of students, however,
stayed for as long as an hour to
listen to anti-war speeches. The
«biggest response came from Ne-
gro students who gathered
around several black power ad-
vocates who were participating
in the demonstration.

Other demonstrations around
the country:

In the San Francisco Bay '
Area, there were demonstrations ‘

day. Tuesday, there was a rally

Platforms —

The Voters Guide

Too often students tend to ignore the p1a’Cf0I‘m Pre-
pared by the Student Government (SG) presidential candi-
dates, partly because of the length and familiarity of planks
which seem to greet us annually on every platform prepared
for an SG campaign. Actually, the platforms are revealing,
for they reﬂect how the respective candidates perceive the
role of SG and their means of improving the status quo.

In comparing the three platforms, we must ﬁrst of all
dismiss the “platform” prepared by the independent can-
didate for this office, Armand Belly. Belly was repeatedly
asked by The Pitt News to submit a platform, and the prod-
uct he submitted only includes his lambasting of the organ-

ization he wants to ﬁrst head and then abolish. Belly pro- ’

poses to abolish SG and “transfer the essential functions
of SG to other organizations.” He has failed to probe his
“solution” to the necessary depth, and we have no guar-
antee that he can effectively fulﬁll this goal.

In dealing with the USA and PAT platforms, we must

. commend both of these parties for an honest effort to pro-

pose speciﬁc programs to improve SG. Both platforms deal
with innumerable areas that need reform while differing
on their approach.

The members of the USA have hit upon countless
areas that need improvement, but the fact that this is the
ﬁrst SG campaign for so many of them is revealed in the
nature of their planks. They have hit upon surface prob-
lems that obviously enter into the picture, but they have
ignored the key issues that face our student body. Their
presidential candidate, George Doperak, repeatedly states
that he veered away from a “pie in the sky” platform. We
admire his practical approach, but the planks offered in
the USA platform are only a limited solution toward Do-
perak’s goal of conquering student apathy.

The PAT platform is similar to that of the USA in
the respect that it, too, contains practical solutions to prob-
lems facing our student body. It goes that -one vital step
further, however, and concentrates on issues students must
continue to pursue, such as striving to attain a ten per
cent across-the-board discount for all students, a discount
faculty and staff now -have. If our Book Center is to con-
tinue to cater to the community, there should be provi-
visions to provide special services to the students at this

1 University.

Points such as a re-evaluation of the language require-
ment and a recommendation that the University -withdraw
from the four-school agreement limiting its football schol-
arships reveal a depth that is lacking in the USA platform.
These and other issues raised by PAT reﬂect a. ‘careful
analysis of the key areas of student. concern.

We again caution students to ‘_ weigh the contents of
these three platfonns before deciding on" a particular can-
didate, for the platforms remain‘ the ‘surest guide to the
goals of the respective contenders. ‘ V I

Buying Victory Bell?

Student Government is now consider-
ing buying a Victory Bell. Swell, When do
they expect to ring it?

Quasimodo would have been insuffer-
ably bored if all he had to do was ring a
bell each time Pitt won in anything. If
the University hires a bell-ringer, he need
not be deaf, just come supplied with a
large stock of good books.

Athletic Director Frank Carver believes
that the world of sports runs in cycles.
The University. he explains, is suffering
through a losing period in its cycle.

Although rigor-mortis is reportedly set-
ting in for some of the athletic programs,
one team has managed to preserve a win-
ning tradition.

Operating on a shoestring budget, play-
ing on a home field that becomes a swamp
when it rains, practicing. on a field that
bears a striking resemblance to Borodino

by Michael Brourman

after the battle in 1812, and fielding a .

team composed primarily of non-scholar-
ship players, Coach Bobby Lewis has still
managed to build one of the better base-
ball teams in the East.

The men who run the Collegiate Base-
ball Tournament each March in Riverside,
California recognized this, and have invit-
ed the mitters to participate this year.

But problems have arisen. The Univers-
ity is not supplying the necessary funds,
and now the players are raffling off a
color TV to try and raise the money.

If Student Government wants to act,
let them scrap their Victory Bell plans
and donate the money to the baseball team.
They need it and they deserve it. They
should be treated in the same manner as
they have represented the University —
First Class.

Letters to the Editor

Senior Outlines

Dual Role

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is my contention that un-
less the Un-iversirty of Ritt-soburgh
acts immediately upon matters
concerning its ﬁscal program,
the whole state of Pennsytlvo.-nrira
will suffer drastic reductiom.
The legislative hassle in Harris-
burg that held up the Universi-
ty"s appropriations is bult one
example of recurring problems
that have plagued this campus
for the last few years -and is
indicative of future problems
yet to come.

But this is not the point. There
is little we can do to clear up
the mess in Harrisburg, despite
such attempts as last term’s
-brilliant leadership of The Pitt
News in active protestation of
the state legislature.

But We can do something to
make the student body, as well
as the faculty and administra-
tion, more aware of the dual
role the University has as it
«now exists. Thus, by creating a
greater cognizance of these roles
within the University itself, we
have a better chance to dissem-
inate knowledge of Pitt utibil-
dtty. In other words, we, the stu-
dents, faculty and 
tion, here in Oakland, not to
mention the assorted regional
campuses, such as Johnsmown
and Bradford, must assume the
responsibility of that of a-sound-
ing «board for the state ingen-
eral.

To rend others aware of the
University's dual role, we must
ourselves be most aware of it.
This -dual role is simple, but
complex in nature. The first sec-
tion of the dual role is theob
viou-.9 dissemination of higher
tonms of knowledge. This is ed-

ucation quite obviously. The -

second part of the dual role is
the University’s responsihﬂlltles
to the community and state in

KnocksHairCuts

Editor, The Pitt News:

The Towers’ Snack Bar area
is the source of much of the
night life action for those living
in the Towers and girls’ dorms.
In fact, it is probably also the
source of much of the day time
action.

At any rate, action is one
thing and hair cuts are some-
thing else. What I mean by that
-is, the Towers’ Snack  area
is no place to have one’s hair

that matter.

Last year Kent State’s
' varsity and freshman traEk
teams defeated the track-
sters, and in so doing set
three Field House records. Two
of those record-holders will be
at the Field House tomornow
when the teams again meet.
Field events will begin at 12:15,
and the races at 1:30.

Both the varsity and frosh,
whose events will be held alter-
nately, are consid-enably strong-
er‘ this year. Although this in-
A dicates a possible reversal of the
team scores, it seems that Sam
Bair and Orin Richburg, Kent”s
superstars, will be hard to beat.

 

Page 6 — THE PITT NEWS — Friday, January 19, 1968

Track Teams Host Kent State Tomorrow

Bair, a graduate of Cslairton,
Pa, high school, is “one of the
three top milers in the United
States at this time,” according
to track coach Jim Banner.
Bair’s time of 4:07.6 in the mile
stands as the Field House rec-
ord.

Another local high school run-
ner, Richburg graduated from
Westinghouse High School in
Pittsburgh. His 6.1 second ef-
fort in the 60 yard dash is also
a Field House record.

Chasing Bair in the mile will
be Paul Zink, a sophomore who
is, ironically, from Ohio. Zink
has been, “looking pretty good,”
according to Banner, and beat
his best time of last year when
he ran a 4:20 mile during an

intra-squad meet in December.

Running in the 60 yard dash
will be Chet Wojiechowski and
Dave Brinn. Wojiechowski‘s 6.3
time a varsity record, is only
two-tenths of a second slower
than the Field House record
held by Richburg.

When asked if Wojiechowski
would possibly have a home-
track advantage, Banner philo-
sophjzed, “A 60 yard dash is a
60 yard dash.”

Thinclad captain Plaul Greig
will be running his two-mile s-pe-
cialty against Kent’s Bill Nor-
ris, a runn-er who has turned
9:06 in the event. Greig’s best
time of 9:17 is the varsity rec-
ord.

Hit By New Spirit

The swimming team is on the road again this week-
end, but this time they carry with them a new air of opti-
mism. Saturday’s opponent is Ohio University.

“The past two practices have been the most spirited and
enthusiastic of the se':soyn,” said head coach Bill Grant. “The boys

are showing signs that an upset
may be in the making Saturday
afternoon.

Grant attributes this new
found spirit to the addition of
swimmers from the student
body. “Old swimmers and some
new boys have come out this
past week,” he said. Two old
swimmens who swam du.ring
their freshman year, Bill Kitch-
ko and Mike Szu-lman, have def-

  
  
   
    
  
    
  
  
   
   
    
  
    
   
  
   
  
   
 
  
   
  
   
  

The gymnasts will have
a battle on their hands when
they visit Annapolis tomor-
now to engage the Navy Mid-
shipmen. The Mi-ddlies are cap-
able of sconing 8.1 point-s per
' game in each event and 170
points per meet.

In their last meet Navy beat
Arir Force 170.05-160.06. Against
Slippery Rock they scored 173.35
. points in another win.

“We are going to play them
the same Way we played Spring-
ﬁeld,” commenvted coach Warren

‘Neiger. “They have a tremen-
douns amount of vlarsilty rstrength,
and I am just going to work as
many freshmen as I can to give

them experience.”

Shidemantle ‘ may even ﬁnd it
hard to get his usual win on

initely decided to rejoin the
swim team. “Right now I have
indications from three other
boys that are willing to go out
with the vansity, and approxi-
mately ﬁve with the freshmen
squad,” he said.

Grant plans 11) make some
line-up surprises for the Ohio
meet, but he expects an up-hill
ﬁght for the victory. Ohio does
not have the -overall balance
that Bucknell had,” he explain-
ed, “but they have certain’ key
boys who will be tough to de-
fea .” _ ’

One of these “key boys” is a
boy who Grant helped coach
during high school. Gnant says,
“Dave Solomon will certainly be
a "thorn in my side when we
meet Ohio. He could possibly
swim in three events, the 1000-
yard, 200-yard butterﬂy, and a
relay.

Solo-m-on swam in the 1964
Maccabean games and won a

.medal there. The only swim-

mer who beat him in the trials
for the games was Mark Spitz,
the world record-holder in the
butterﬂy. “This boy will be one
of the best that we will see all

seas-on,” said Gnant.

in the 600 and 1000 y_ard runs.
He and Greg Ellis, who holds
the Field House shot put record,
are expected to join Groig and
Wojicchowski in the category of
stars on a team that lacks depth.

Senior Tom Christie will be
joined by sophomore Bob El-
heny in the long jump. Christie
holds the varsity record with a
2110” mark, and Mclﬂlheny
holds the fresh mark, after a
20’1” leap last year.

Another event in which a
sophomore, Carlos Rciscn, will
join a more experienced junior,
Dave Brinn, and senior, Christie,
will be the hurdles. The hur-
dlers offer the most depth on
the -team in =a single event.

A strong mile realy team will

be looked to for a split in two
relay events. Kent will add Bud
An(i01‘s0n's efforts to those of
Bair and Norris in the two mile
relay and the result could be
one of the best two mile relay
teams in the NCAA.

The freshman squad, which
established two all-time school
and eight freshman records in
their ﬁrst meet last week against

the Plebes of Navy, will chal- P

lenge the Kent freshmen.

Miler Jerry Richey and high
jumper Bryant Salter, new
school record holders, should be
as awesome to the Kent frosh
as the Kent “Bair and Richburg”
combination may be ot the var-
sity trackers.

mal attendance at a Field House
track meet.

Richey posted a new mile
standard of 4:11.3 while Salter
eras-ed the high jump mark with
a leap of 6-8. Both will be out
to improve, but Salter may have
some tnouble. .

' The high jump pit at the
Field House is situated in such

an area where he will be forced

to cut up to three steps off his
normal approach. Also his an-
gle will be slightly different, the
pit will be different, and the
boards he will be jumping off
will b different.

“I deﬁnitely won't get as much
spring as I could use," said the
rangy high jumper. “Those

. boards don't provide the right

force for my legs. At Navy the
boards were hard, but I could
get the right spring for my
legs.”

“I’ld have to make adjust-
me-nts,” he estimated. “Actually
I’m always adjusting, even since
the Navy meet. I’ve tried mov-
ing "the standlards around. I’ll
probably be able to get it all
night by Saturday.”

room -for Salter to take about
seven approach steps :before
jumping. Normally he likes to
take about three walking steps
before accelerating for the ﬁnal
seven. Tomorrow, he'll -have to
generate his speed faster.

“Actusally, this miighrt be a
~ble.ssing in disguise,” offered
Salter’s coach Jim Banner. “If
he learns to develop a lot of
drive from a shorrt approach,
when he gets a long apgprroacvh
he’ll have it.”

School record notwilthtsrlzandzinlg,
Banner was probably happier
with the jump Salter missed at
6-10. Bryant had the ba.r clear-
ed with his hips, only to nrudge
it off with his ankle on the way
down. Coming that close should
be if1C€”f1't'iVe enough to ignore
Field House deterrents. '

Tale of Two Streaks:

9 Panthers Lose Again;

Cubs Trip WVU Frosh

MORGANTOWN, "W. Va.—The freshman and varsity
basketball teams suffered from two long losing streaks to
West Virginia teams when they traveled here Wednesday
afternoon. But only the Cubs broke the WVU hex.

For the varsity, it was the same old story: they lost. And in
failing to win, the Panthers’ losing streak against WVU extended
into a fifth year_ Also the cagers have now lost five straight to

bring their record to 2-7.

The Panthers fell into a one-
sided game early as the Moun-
taineers jumped off to a 7-0 lead
they never lost. Forced to play
catch-up ball, the Panthers were
out-rebounded and out-ran. -And
by the end of the second half
the Panthers tried a slowed-up,
deliberate offense to keep the
score down to a minimum of
embarrassment.

West Virginia’s Carey Bailey
was high scorer with 23 points
and Ron Williams chipped in 19
points in addition to a variety
of fancy assists. Both players
were unstoppable.

“We had no one who could
guard either Williams or Bailey,
man to man,” said head coach‘
Bob Timmons.

Timmons neglected to explain
why he didn’t change from his
man-to-man defensive g a In e

the score had switched back and
forth many times and after sev-
eral deadlocks. G-euorge Medich
led the winners with 13 points.
Jerry Fair scored ten points for
Phi Kap.

The Delts’ rolled over the Sam-
mies after scoring 24 points in
the opening half. This was all
that SAM could come up with
for the entire game. Doug Beth-

ke was a leading scorer for the
Delts with 14 points.

A strong defense held off-

ZBT’s roundballers and Fred
Pinckney tallied 12 points for
Pi Lam's Win. Jeff Heimberg
scored 12 of the loser’s 19.

Brian J on-tow scored 13 points
in leading Phi Ep to its triumph
over Delta Sig. Lou Parrott
paced the latter with ten points.

SAE went over the 50-point
mark in scoring their victory.

plan to a zone defense.
“There’s not much I could

say,” said Timmons. “We’re not

an overpowering club and they

-were just too strong for us.”

Meanwhile, the freshman
team made the trip worthwhile
by winning 81-63 in the prelim-
inary game. The Cubs’ victory
ended a 15-year losing streak to
West Virginia freshman teams
here. I

The frosh game was also a
one-sided affair, as guard Mike
Caldwell banged in 17 points in.
the first half help the Cubs
jump into a 42-26 lead by the
intermission. Overall, Caldwell
accounted for 21 points and four
assists.

“Caldwell played a real clutch
game,” said an elated assistant
coach Tim Grgurich. “We knew
he could shoot and he came
through for us tonight.”

The Cubs hit nearly 50 per
cent from the floor.

“We were making our shots
tonight,” explained Caldwell_
“In our other games we would
get the open shot and then miss
-it. But we were making them
tonight.”

“We controlled the boards,”
said forward Bob Gailus. “West
Virginia didn’t have anyone
that was strong and agressive
underneath. They were a little
taller than us, but we were
much stronger.”

Frosh Matmen Nail Cal, 20-13

One of the keys to getting
any athletic program back
on its feet is good recruit-
ing. Wrestling coach Dave
Adams and assistant Bob Fehrs
are breathing a little easier af-
ter the freshmen grapplers top-
ped the previo-ulsly unbeaten Cal-
ifornia (Pa.) freshmen, 20-13,
Tuesday night.

Although trailing 10-O prac-
tically before they were settled,
the frosh rebounded to win six
of the ﬁnal seven bouts. Califor-
nia’s record was 7-0 before los-
ing Tuesday.

“I was pleased with the meet,”
said Fehrs, who serves as fresh-
man mentor. “We got off to a
bad start, and I was afnaid they
would fold. They came back real
well.

“I felt we were in a bit better
condition than we showed,” he
continued, “but it was our first
match and you’re always ner-
vous before your ﬁrst match.
California had already had sev-
en matches.”

Of the six individual frosh
victories, only one was account-
ed for by a fall. In the 152
pound match, Ron Lavery of
McClelland, Pa., pinned Paul

Harkins.

“He manhandled his opponent
right from the start,” reviewed
Fehrs. “He had Htarkins on his
back in the ﬁrst period, and he
pinned him in the second.”

Fehrs felt that the best bout
of the match was the 145 clash
between Panther Mark Payne
