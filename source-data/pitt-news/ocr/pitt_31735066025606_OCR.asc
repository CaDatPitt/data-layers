McClearn said at Thursday night’s

IFC discusses revision of its constitution and bylaws

By Heather Gahres
Staff Writer

The debate over the proposed changes
to the Inter-Fraternity Council’s constitu-
tion and bylaws was continued last night
in a discussion open to all council mem-
bers. _ ,

IFC President Gregory Rea proposed the
changes to the constitution at the Oct. 20
IFC meeting.

“The main reason [for changing the con-
stitution and bylaws] is clarity. The consti-
tution and bylaws needed to be redone,
and they needed to be more deﬁned,” Rea
said.

The major complaint of people present
at the meeting was the lack of standing
committees and on the lack of time to dis-
cuss the proposal before voting on it.

“There have been a lot of complaints

that the proposal decreases participation‘

within the IFC because of the lack of
standing committees. [The proposal] does
not decrease the participation, but increas-
es the coordination, communication,

potential for individual leadership and the

coherency of the IFC,”‘Rea said. _

SIFC Chief Justice Jeremy Weiss said he
applauded the effort of the IFC president
for revising the constitution and bylaws.

“The fact that there are no standing com-

mittees [in the proposal] is totally unac-
ceptable. I suggest that everyone takes this
document home to their houses and look
at it. The focus of this is good, but [the
revision of the constitution] could take a
year. This is too rushed,” Weiss said.

IFC Secretary Joe Bowman said that after
talking to Teny Milani, the assistant direc-
tor of Student Activities, that Milani was
going to recommend that the proposal be
dropped instead of rushing through the
changes in order to implement them
before the elections of the new executive
board.

“I agree that there need to be some
changes, but they should not be done by
one person or the advisor  ‘We should
wait and let the next executive board
make the decisions that will be best for
them. We should let_ them make the deci-
sions for their future,” said Bowman.

Rea said that the decision will be made
by the IFC as a whole and that there’ really
is not a great deal being changed in the
proposal. 4

“lln the proposal] there’s not a great
change. It’s just redefining where the focus
of our participation is and it clarifies a lot

, of things that are in the current document,”

Rea said. _
Rea also said that Greek Week and the
IFC Judicial board need to be recognized

as separate entities. He said another reason
for the change was to define the duties of
the delegates and individual fraternities.

There were also policies missing from
the current IFC constitution and bylaws
that needed to be added, Rea said.

“We need a policy‘ for expansion  the
powers of the executive board need to be
defined, and the university’s place in the
structure of the IFC needs to be defined,”
Rea said.

Ira Horowitz of Phi Gamma Delta said
that the proposal seemed good, except for
the restructuring of the executive board.

“Restructuring the executive board is
concentrating a lot of powers into a few
people. Now, if someone is not doing their
job, then the people under or above them
can get it done,” Horowitz said.

Rush co—chair, Eddie Ifft, agreed that the

‘organizational problems in the IFC are not

due to the executive board.

“The main problems are there is no con-
tinuity and monitoring needs to be
changed. Greek Week chairs are given
manuals on their positions, and that’s why
it’s so effective. We need to do that. Each
chair needs to be responsible to create a
manual for each position,” Ifft said.

_“Many ideas have been brought up
including amendments to the bylaws and

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Tuesday, October 27, 1992

CWO speaker talks
about experiences

at rape crisis center

Kelly B. Casey.
Photography Editor

As a former volunteer for a rape hotline, Barbara

Weiner would clean her house during a four-hour shift to »

relieve her anxiety as she waited for the phone to'ring,
she said last night at the Campus Women’s Organization
meeting in the Cathedral of Learning.

Her toughest call, she said, came from a Pittsburgh
woman, who was repeatedly raped by her husband.

“Her only choice was to stay there and live or leave
and die,” Weiner said. The victim thought that her hus-
band would kill her if she left, Weiner said. “I felt help-
less,” said \Y/einer.

However, she did not feel helpless enough to stop
working with sexual assault victims.

Today, Weiner works full-time as the education training
specialist for the Pittsburgh Rape Crisis Center (PAAR).

Weiner said she decided to work at the crisis center

"after working with girls under 18, who were taken out of

their homes and sent to a group home.

“Ninety percent of the girls at the shelter were sexually
assaulted. That’s when I realized rape was so prevalent,
and I needed to do something about it,” said \Y/einer,
who received a bachelor’s degree in social work from
Indiana University of Pennsylvania. ‘

PAAR, founded in 1972, is a traditional rape crisis cen-
ter that provides short and long-term services for rape
victims. Most crisis centers do not provide long—term ser-
vices, Weiner said. 

The center offers a 24-hour hotline. “Most people who
call our hotline are survivors of sexual assault which
could have happened two months ago, two days ago or

. 20 to 40 years ago,” she said.

Other callers are parents, boyfriends, teachers or some-

one close to a victim of sexual assault, Weiner said,

adding that one-third of the callers are male.

Weiner outlined the free services provided by over 100
volunteers and 27 staff professionals. The services
include anything from paying the cab fare for a victim
who chooses to go to a hospital for treatment to asking
an insensitive police officer to leave the room if the vic-
tim is too upset to answer questions.

Over the past year, the number of people who call the

government-funded center has increased over 200 per— _

cent, Weiner said. Many people who call have to wait
two years to receive counseling, she added.

ByJohn Temple
Staff Writer

Administration officials debat-
ed yesterday whether the uni-
versity should, and can afford
to, prosecute students through
the judicial board for off—cam-
pus misconduct.

Although some of the partici-
pants of yesterday’s meeting

disagreed, Vice Chancellor of
Student Activities William
Harmon repeatedly stated that
he believes the university can
expand its jurisdiction, but it

needs to create a process in‘

order to do so.

Office of Student Activities
officials met with representa-
tives from the Judicial Board
and the General Counsel to
have an exploratory discussion
about the proposed new plan.
Harmon» believes the plan is

necessary in the face of disrup-
tion and dangerous situations
that students cause off campus.

Terrence Milani of the Office
of Student Activities was a dis-
senting voice, saying that once
the limits of jurisdiction were
expanded beyond the campus
they would be difficult to
define.

“Once you begin saying we
have a custodial duty in regard
to the conduct of_ students off
campus, then pretty soon we
will begin to be challenged for
accountability for students in a
hundred different areas,” said
Milani.

He also said that Pitt’s judicial
system would have to be great-
ly expanded to handle all the
cases that would result from the
new policy.

Harmon indicated that he was

I not interested in pursuing every

.§-

3

potential case of off—campus
misconduct and advocated
using “common sense” to
decide who to take action
against.

“It is not my intent to inter-
fere with students’ social lives,”
he said. “But the fact that they
are students does not give them
the right to disrupt neighbor-
hoods.”

Aside from the practicality of
the proposal, the legal issues
were also discussed. Andrew
Hughey of the Office of
General Counsel said an expan-
sion of jurisdiction would be
possible.

“The precedents indicate that
the kind of things we’re talking
about doing can be done,” he
said. “I can tell you some rea-
sons why not to do them or
why to be circumspect before

Club works for animals

ByAmyDaum

For The Pitt News

The Friends of Animals club
has several activities planned in
the next month to promote
awareness of the abuses it
believes animals suffer at the

‘ hands of humans.

Tuesday night the club is
sponsoring the showing of The
Animals Film at the Beehive at

7:30. The footage and message

of the two—hour film, released

in 1981, are still relevant, club .

President Michelle Grant said.
The film includes footage of
hunt sabs, when people go into

, forests during hunting season

to prevent hunters from killing
game.

There are interviews in the
film with members of The
Animal Liberation Front who
broke into labs and factory
farms to take animals and put
them in private homes. Other
interviews are with scientists
who used animals ingtheir
experiments but have now
stopped. '

The film also shows footage
of the living conditions of ani-
mals in factory farms, where
animals are raised to feed peo-
ple.

“The footage is so awful and
so truthful that when people
see it hopefully they will make
changes in their lives,” ‘Grant
said.

Some changes she said she
would like to s_ee includeipeo-
ple trying to become, vegetari-
ans and students going into the
fields of biology and medicine,
choosing not to dissect animals
and developing alternatives to
animal research. '

The film.is just oneiway\ the V

members of the Friends of
Animals are trying to change
how people View the treat-
ment of animals in our so-
ciety.

They are also boycotting the

luter of the Boston area and

number—one ranking member
on the Health and Human
Services Committee. He has
raised money for ovarian and
breast cancer research."
“Yeakel wants socialized

health care like they have in,

Canada,“ Rosenberg said.
“When the government inter-
venes in the health care sys-
tem, the system will surely
fail.,I ask you, do you want
to wait four ‘months to see a
doctor?” V A

‘On the stand of abortion,
Rosenberg said, “Arlen
Specter believes that a
woman does have the right
to choose, and that the issue
does not belong in the politi-
cal arena.”

Tom Smith, a top political
consultant for the
Bush/Quayle campaign, gave
three messages to the College
Republicans. The first was an
announcement that Pitt and
Carnegie Mellon Republicans

make up one—fourth of all the
Republican volunteers in
Allegheny County.

“The second message is
that we’re going to win this
election,” Smith said. “The
polls are closing fast, the
Clinton p camp is running
scared, the president is
sounding great, and you’ve
alllworked hard, so we’re
going to win it.”

“My final message that I
have explained in all too
much detail is that every vote
counts,” Smith said. “In every
election I’ve had anything to
do with, particularly in
Western Pennsylvania where
Republicans are a vast minor-
ity, every vote counts.”

Smith said that if everyone
in the room would find six
people to vote Bush/Quayle
with them, the Republicans
would win Oakland.

“The state of Pennsylvania
is absolutely pivotal to the
election since we do have a

significant number of
Republicans. Whoever gets
the popular votes gets every
electoral college vote. It’s
winner takes all. There is
nothing more important than
going and finding those two
extra Republican votes,”
Smith said. '0 * - '

“The liberal media is trying
to stop the Bush train,” Smith
said. “The next thing they’ll
do is have pictures of Millie
and someone.”

Two College Republicans,
Dave Ott and Tom’ Grassia,
spoke about ‘bringing change
to the Student Government
Board if they are elected as
representatives.

A movie entitled Clinton
versus Clinton was shown
after Rosenberg’s speech. The
film spoofed Clinton’s chang-
ing stands on issues ranging
from his acceptance for the
presidential Democratic nom-
ination to his draft defer-
ment.

Pennsylvania has 600,000

lem is that Republicans
always show up to vote but
we [as Democrats] don’t,” he
said. A

The University Democrats
urged college students to vol-
unteer for the Bill Clinton
campaign and participate in
phone banking.

“We need as many volun-
teers as possible to call regis-
tered voters and identify our
supporters,” said Bill Buck,
the Pittsburgh deputy field
coordinator for the Clinton

e campaign. “We are doing very

well, but we need to energize
our supporters.”

Buck said the positive ener-
gy from the campaign is emit-
ting an extremely high morale
for the staff at the downtown
office.

College students must real-
ize that Clinton has a pro-
gram to make college afford-
able for everyone within a
year, Buck said.

Rooney discussed the enor-
mous debt facing college stu-
dents which makes, higher
education less accessible. He
joked that many years ago he
paid $450 in college tuition
per semester.

“Bill lCoyne] wants to pro-
vide assistance to higher edu-
cation so that the burden

Brody said he also voted
for the plan but explained
that it had been proposed by

"the Office of Student Affairs,

to both increase the number
of presidential candidates and
make the time commitment
manageable. I

“You’re not only represent-
ing students,” Brody said.
“You’re representing the stu-
dent body to the administra-
tion, to the faculty, staff,

Board of Trustees, the univer-
sity community as well as the
local community within the
city of Pittsburgh. The time
that goes into this office is
more than a lot of people can
handle.”

Campus safety was an
issue addressed by a majority
of the candidates. However,
board hopeful Ted Schroeder
said that campus safety
resources were already avail-
able but were not being uti-

Weiner stressed the point
that the center does not
advocate what is the right
or wrong way to handle a
rape. The philosophy of
the center is very pro-

A choice, she said.

It is left up to the victim
to decide what do to,
whether that means going
to the hospital, court or
just forgetting about it.

“You choose what you
can handle,” Weiner said.
She added that this applies
to callers as well as volun-
teers, many of whom
decide shortly after volun-
teering at the center that
they cannot handle it.

As an education special-
ist, Weiner ta_lks to stu-

dents ranging from ele-
mentary to college level.
Sometimes she has to get
young kids, who don’t
believe rape is possible, to
talk about it.

“Some junior high boys
believe there is no such
thing as rape  ,” because,
they reason, “she has to
help him get it in there.”

Thirteen out of 27 stu-
dents at the meeting signed
a sheet passed around the
room asking for Volun-
teers. 

“There seems to be a
new wave of conscious-
ness among college stu-
dents,” Weiner said, noting

ing to work the hotline.

With only one female, Tara
Munkatchy, running for the
student board, the candidates
were asked how they would
represent women’s issues.
Anthony Moody responded,
“As any issue I would discuss

Hughey said that a jurisdic-
tional statement in the student
code would make the proposed
policy enforceable.

Director of Student
Development Robert Gallagher
said he doubted that cases
could be successfully built
against students for off—campus
misconduct.

But Harmon noted that uni-
versities originally had much
more control over their stu-
dents.

“I think in years past, colleges
and universities were seen as
having control over students in
loco parentzs,” he said. “And I
think colleges and universities
backed off of that approach for
some of the very reasons ‘we
have been discussing here.”

Press-ing freedom

Amendment]

“Congress shall ma/ee no law respecting an establishment
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or
abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right
of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the gov-
ernment for a redress of grievances. 

Everyso often it is necessary for us to address the ques-
tion of what the First Amendment means. Usually we do
not have to do it so directly, for the freedom of the press
is implicit in the newspaper that we put out four days a
week. However, several individuals and student organiza-
tions on campus have recently requested the right to edit
stories written about them before the story gets printed.
Therefore, it is once again necessary for us to define what
exactly a free press means and reiterate the fact that all of
our editors are more than {qualiﬁed to do their jobs.

Just as a free market. economy is by no means an
absolute, neither is freedom. of the.press. Throughout the
centuries, beneﬁcial laws have been passed limiting what
the press can and cannot do. However, the limits placed
on the press have been minimal at best —— mainly restrict-
ed to libel and times of national crisis. The reason for this
is obvious —— restricting the press is hardly: the issue. Once
one puts a muzzle on one facet of society, where will the
next one be placed? Perhaps on those who are protesting
the freedom of the press. _ '

A free press is a vague term. It means different things to
different people. However, what scares us the most is the
defnition accepted by those on the poles of the political

A spectrum. In other words, free speech and press has come

to mean “it’s OK to say or write something so long as I
agree with it.” .

For now though, there is no KGB on campus, and it is, _

therefore, our right to report the facts of a situation or
event as they have been presented to us.“ Intrinsic to
being an impartial observer though, is the ‘fact that we will
not always understand the situation in its entirety.
Therefore, it is also the job of interview subjects (especial-
ly group leaders) to make sure that-we do understand --

_ in order to minimize inaccurate reporting. It is the cooper-

ative work of both sides which fully serves the commur1i-
ty as a whole.

Sure we make mistakes — we’re human like everyone"

else. But it’s necessary to remember that we serve a pur-
pose to act as a conscience for the university community.
Likewise, your job is to act as our conscience, as was evi-

' denced by the protests organized against us one month

ago. A system of checks and balances has been put into
place. But just as that protest was a symbol of your inher-
ent right to assemble, our daily coverage is an inherent
symbol of a free press. If you take our right away to “print
the news and raise hell,” then you are undermining your
own efforts to do the same thing. .

I am writing in reference to Nat
Finkin’s “Anti—rape artwork” arti-
cle (Oct 13). Imagine my surprise
when I realized that I was the
“said radical feminist” Mr. Finkin
was referring to in his article. I
am very interested in the fact that
my conversation with his room-
mate lasted less than two minutes
and consisted mainly of him
venting his anger about the “Stop
Raping” signs, yet they both felt
knowledgeable enough to call
me a radical feminist and a femi-
nazi. If it made them feel better
to call me a radical feminist, that
is fine with me, but my only
intention was to open his room-
mate’s eyes to another side of the
issue namely that some people
might view the signs as effective
or empowering. ,

I did not do anything to “justifi-
ably make [Finkin’sl roommate
upset” — he started out that way,
and I certainly did nothing to
provoke him into this fit of rage.
I quickly realized that he just did
not understand that rape is a very
personal issue‘ for people who
have survived this violation.
These survivors are ‘affected
every day of their lives by what
has happened to them. The truth
is that these signs were probably
designed more to help the sur-
vivors of rape than to enlighten
close-minded people like Finkin
and his roommate.

Seven years ago I was raped.
When I first noticed these signs, I
felt a tremendous sense of
empowerment — a sense that
finally someone was on my side.
If I experienced these emotions
after seven years, then it must be
acknowledged how deeply rape
affects a person. The healing
process following a rape is life-
long, and if these signs do any-

_ thing to help rape survivors, then

I say they have value. These
signs appeared over a year ago
in numerous places throughout
the university, and I ﬁnd it inter-
esting that they'are suddenly
evoking such a charged
response. ~Why are Mr. Finkin
and his roommate being so
defensive, especially when no

The "said feminist" replies to 

one is forcing them to look at the
signs?

Finkin claims that these slo-
gans “are a huge affront to men”
because they assume that “a
majority of the male population
rape women.” Studies show that
as many as 1 in 3 women will be
raped, and that these rapes will
be committed mostly by men. In
our society rape is primarily a
crime against women (and chil-
dren), and it is symptomatic of
the degradation of women in

Letters

society. Most anti—porn groups
feelgthat the most common
images in porn are not primarily
of men as love-slaves as Finkin
claims, but rather they are of
women and children in submis-
sive, humiliating positions. These
images are marketed as being
erotically stimulating for men,
and this, Mr. Finkin is what con-
tributes to the causes of rape.

A close minded conservative

A To put it bluntly, I was‘
appalled by Matt C_a1ter’s editorial
“Gore-y Details from a
Conservative.” Is there any group
that Mr. Carter does not look
down upon? He uses the phrase
“sandal freak” implying that mod-
ern hippies are freaks of nature.
Mr. Carter, have you ever low-
ered yourself to speak to a “san-
dal freak?” I assure you, they are
quite human with human reason-
ing capacities. They are willing to
stand up (and sometimes stand
out) for their beliefs, just as you
are. Also, concerning your quip
about “old people” that are
unable to stop being “radical
activists,” are you implying that
any elderly person that does not
agree with your. beliefs is either
stubborn or senile?

I was especially amused by Mr.
Carter’s use of the term “femi-
nazis.” By my understanding,

/

Nazis believe they are superior to
anyone different. Does this not,
in fact, apply to Mr. Carters way
of thinking? Most feminists I
know, however, strive for a soci-
ety void of stratification.

I believe that open-mindedness
is desirable. However, if one
chooses to cling to his/her nar-
row-minded beliefs, perhaps
she/ he should not blurt out opin-
ions of things s/he knows noth-
ing about. *

Hemp declared OK at Pitt

Last Thursday The Pitt News

published an article of mine on
the issue of the cannabis hemp
plant. The last paragraph of my
article was deleted and a para-
graph not written by me was put
in its place.

The point of my article was not
to “simply say that hemp has
benefits,” although if one takes
any amount of time at all to
explore the subject this will sure-
ly be proven out.

My point was that even if this
plant offers no practicalbenefits
to others or myself (which it
does), my choice to grow, pos-
sess and use this plant should
not be criminalized unless it
poses an inherent harm to others
(which it does not).

Anything can be abused and
used in harmful ways, including
alcohol, sex and food. To crimi-
nalize these things which can be
used in beneﬁcial ways because
their use has the potential _for
doing harm would simply be
wrong. _

To have criminalized hemp
supposedly to protect the public
from the potential harm is equal-
ly wrong and just a smoke screen
of an excuse used by the power-
brokers to keep hemp from com-
peting with the petroleum, cotton
and synthetic fiber and paper
industries. I simply say hemp is
OK, Pass the joint!

Men's tennis ends fall with 9-16 record at Duquesne Invite

Byjason Brame
Staﬂ’ Writer

In its ﬁnal tournament of the fall season,
the men’s tennis team earned a- second
place trophy in a doubles bracket and com-
piled a 9-16 record at the Duquesne
Invitational last weekend.

The Panthers completed their season
with a perfect 3-0-1 record.

The tournament field included Saint
Bonaventure, the University of Detroit, the
University of Buffalo and Duquesne
University. ' .

Unlike the Eastern Michigan Invitational
on Oct. 2-4, in which all players competed
against equal seeds, the Duquesne Invite
grouped the top three seeds and the
bottom three seeds into two groups and
let them battle within their respective
groups.

This allowed for unmatched seeds to
have a chance to play each other — a
departure from standard collegiate tennis.

The No. 1 seed for the Panthers, Alex
Cobbold, lost to Thiru Govender of Saint
Bonaventure 6-2, 64 in his first match of
the day. Unable to compete in the consola-
tion match due to a muscle pull in his leg,
Cobbold defaulted to ﬁnish at 0-2.

Pitt’s No. 2 seed, Scott Smith, encoun-
tered similar problems in his second match
as he was forced to withdraw to Vince
Riveroll of Duquesne after defeating
Buffalo’s John LaVere 6-3, 6-4.

Eric Weaver, Pitt’s No.. 3 seed, lost two
matches in his bracket. The ﬁrst came to
Adolfo Willete of Saint Bonaventure 6-1, 7-
5. The second went to Julio Godreau 7-5,
64.

In bracket B, the grouping of seeds 4, 5
and 6, the Panthers encountered greater
success as the bottom grouping broke even
with a 5-5 record. '

No. 4 seed James Chronister defeated St.
Bonaventure’s Jay Hamed 6-0, 7-6 but lost
to Jeff Eddy of Detroit 6-0, 6-3.

Effrum Gamett, the Panthers’ no. 5 seed,

encountered the most success in the singles

‘draw. He notched two victories before

ﬁnally having to succumb to an illness mid-
way through his match with the Buffalo’s
Matt Klein. The score for the match was 6-
4, 1-0 before Gamett withdrew.

Garnett did, however, garner two tough
wins in the bracket after losing his opening
match to Kirby Hasseman of Detroit 6-3, 4-
6, 6-2. He defeated Dave Gallagher, also
from Detroit, 6-4, 6-4, _before encountering
Panther teammate David Dumpel, whom
he dispatched 4-6, 6-2, 7-5.

No. 6 seed Jeff Campbell split his two
matches of the day. The senior began by
defeating ‘Matt Klein of Buffalo before bow-
ing out to Brian Mitchell of Saint
Bonaventure 7-6, 6-2.

David Dumpel, PitI’s seventh player, lost
to Luis Gum’ of the University of Buffalo, 6-
2, 6-2, before defeating Jason Fuges of
Duquesne, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5.

The doubles pairing of Garnett and
Campbell provided the Panthers with the

only placing of the weekend, a second
place finish in Group B. The duo began by
beating pairs from Duquesne and Buffalo,
6-2, 6-0 and 6-4, 6-2 respectively, before
losing to Saint Bonaventure, 7-6, 60.

In Group A, the team of Cobbold and
Chronister defeated a team from Detroit 6-
1, 6-3 before losing to Mark Garwood and
Tony ’\X7h_itt, also from Detroit, 6-4, 7-5.

Weaver and Smith, the second of Pitt’s
two Group A pairs, were hampered by
Srnith’s toe infection as they» defaulted to
Robert Rydell and Kirby Hasseman of
Detroit. 1

Dumpel and Kevin Sambuchino, the sec-
ond of the two Group B pairings, suffered
a loss to Luis Gurri and David Monkarsh of
Buffalo, 5-7, 6-3, 6-1, after receiving a bye
in their first match of the day.

This tournament concludes at large com-
petition for the fall season, as only the ITCA
Rolex Tournament is left to be played.
Smith and Cobbold will represent the team
at the Princeton, N.J., tournament.

leaves Pitt

By Cory Walborn

A teary-eyed Ann Marie
Lucanie could‘not hold back.
Emotion was running wild
through the whole Pitt volley-
ball team, but Lucanie was the
first to show it.

She needed a hug and
wanted to give one at the
same time — so she did.

Throwing her arms around
Tracy Komar, Lucanie was
saying goodbye. Komar was
transferring to Mercyhurst
College, and the Pitt volley-
ball team, which followed
I.ucanie’s lead in a group hug,
was missing her already.

Komar, a sophomore middle
hitter for Pitt, did not play at
all this season because of nag-
ging shin splints in her legs.

because it does not offer the
major she wanted — fashion

The Pitt women’s
tennis team wrapped
up the 1992-’93 fall
season by defeating

Indiana University of
Pennsylvania and
Youngstown State.

These two victories
gave Pitt a final fall
record of 7-3. *

The Lady Panthers will
now enter the spring
campaign knowing that

they have already
completed their first
winning season in four
years.

On Oct. 14, Pitt faced
one of the region’s
tougher competitors

when the team traveled
to Indiana, Pa., to face
the IUP Indians. These

battles in recent history,
and this installment was
the closest by far."

Top seed Julie LoPrinzi
gave Pitt an early lead
with a victory over Heidi
Sjoberg of IUP. .

After dropping the first

LoPrinzi stormed back
with a vengeance, drop-
ping only three games for
the rest of the match.
_ She would go on to win
in three sets (5-7, 6-1, 6-
2).
'IUP’s Amy Newlon
‘ quickly evened it up by
defeating Pitt’s Alison
Baker in No. 2 singles.
Newlon won convincing-
ly, taking the match in
straight sets (6-1, 6-2).
The Lady Panthers
answered back with con-
secutive victories in N05.
3 and 4 singles.
Senior Erika Devins,
who has been one of the
Lady Panthers’ most

two teams have had close I

set seven games to five,‘

Panther women's tennis
clinches winning year

steady performers, rolled
through her No. 3 singles
match. Devins wasted no
time in this match, win-
ning in straight sets (6-2,
6-0).

Marla Zielinski followed
with a win in the No.
4 spot. Zielinski’s straight
set (6-1, 6-4) victory
gave Pitt a 3-1 match
lead, with two more
singles matches left to

play.
The Lady Panthers saw
their lead evaporate

when the Indians stepped
up to take the final two
singles matches, leaving
the contest to be decided
in the doubles round.
Pitt’s No. 1 doubles
team of LoPrinzi and
Devins helped Pitt regain
the lead when the team
thumped the IUP tan-
dem of Sjoberg/Newlon

in straight sets (6-2, 6-0).‘

The score was 4-3 with
two matches to go. .

IUP again climbed back
with a win in No. 2 dou-
bles,

Augustine/Lio defeated
Baker/Zielinski in straight
sets (6-4, 6-3) to tie it up
at four matches apiece.
This meant that Pitt’s No.
3 doubles team of Andrea
Passarelo/Carie Voda
would play the IUP duo
of Hort/Barker in a win-
ner-take-all match.

After dropping the first
set 6-2, Passarelo/Voda
took the second set’ by

_the same 6-2 score. This

forced a deciding third-
set tiebreaker.

The battle in the final
set went back and forth
until the two teams were
tied with six games
apiece. Both teams would
now have to play a
match-deciding, third-set

Pitt lacrosse tames Lions 17-3

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Staff Writer

Pitt fans have not had too
much to cheer about lately
when it comes to their rivalry
with Penn State. But this past
weekend, the Panther lacrosse
team found a way to reverse
what has become a disturbing
trend — losing to the Lions.

Powered by a strong second

period, the Panthers ranoff

five unanswered goals to
break open a close game and
propel Pitt to a 17-3 victory
over its arch-rivals from State
College Sunday at the Cost
Center.

-The Panthers quickly went
up 1-0 on a goal by attackman
Josh Gochnauer, who tapped
in the bouncing ball after it
rebounded off the Penn State
netminder.

Although Pitt dominated
play in the opening minutes,
a Panther mistake allowed
Penn State back into the
game. Defenseman Tim
Kenkel mishandled a ground

3 ball, and the Lions jumped on

it deep in the Panthers’ end,
firing a shot that just avoided
the stick of goaltender Scott
Knowles to knot the game up
at one apiece.

 

   STUDET
  GVERNMENT

From that point on Pitt
dominated the action, thor-
oughly outplaying Penn State
offensively and virtually shut-
ting the Lions out defensively.
Still the game remained tied at
1-1 until Scott Gordan’s goal
at the 9:53 mark gave Pitt its
second lead of the game as
the two teams entered the
second period.

The goals that eluded Pitt in_
the first quarter came in a

windfall during the second as
the Panthers’ dominance
began to show on the scoring
column. . ,

Gordan added two more
goals during the-period, and_
the Panthers received addi-
tional scores from Rich Oh,
Lee Stember (2), Gochnauer
(2). and Eric Kaveny« to
break open what had been a
close game. The Panthers
charged to a 10-2 lead at the
half.

Pitt did not make life for the
Lions any easier in the second
half. Goals by Brett Mulligan,
Craig Leslie, Stember,
Gochnauer, Brian Barrett,
Daryll Schmitt and Kaveny
completed the rout.

Defensively, the Panthers
were led by the aggressive
play of Kenkel, Chris Baily,

 

J

John Foris, Luke Fox and the
physical Chris Rice, who took
time out to greet the opposi-
tion with some crushing hits
of his own. As a unit, the
Panthers held Penn State to
just two second-half shots.
Goaltenders Knowles and
Mike Shiner put in solid per-
formances. .

Pitt head coach Gary Neft
said he was very pleased with
his team’s performance but
noted that he expected the
game to be a little more com-
petitive than it turned _out to

‘be.

“I expected them to be bet-
ter than they were,” Neft said.
“We did play well, though. I
think we are a better team
than last year already.”

Pitt will take its show on
the road this weekend when
the team travels down to
Morgantown to play in an
annual tournament held at
West Virginia University. The
Panthers competed in the
same tournament last fall. Neft
said he l.ikes his team’s
chances to win. .

“I would say that we are
going in as one of the
favorites,” he said. “I believe
we have just as good a
chance as anyone.”

THE PI'IT NEWS, Tuesday, October 27, 1992

Matt Serlin/The Pitt News

Gerald Wilkins of the Cavs -challenged ajayson Williams shot last night at the Civic Arena.

By Brian Gallagher
and Rob Pugliese
The Pitt News

Chris Morris pumped in 50
points and Kenny Anderson
added 22 points and 11 assists
as the new—lool< New Jersey
Nets defeated the Cleveland
Cavaliers in overtime, 120-116,
last night in an NBA preseason
contest at the Civic Arena.

The Nets outscored the Cavs
16-12 in the extra session —
grabbing the lead for good on a
Chris Dudley lay-up a minute
into overtime. New Jersey then

went 8—for—10 at the foul line to
secure its third preseason win.

Cleveland (2-4) was led by
Larry .Nance’s 26 points and 14
boards. Five other Cavs notched
double figures — including
Mark Price, who added 20
points despite playing only 25
minutes. The Cavs were with-
out All—Star center Brad
Daugherty, who missed the
game due to tendonitis in his
left knee.

The Nets grabbed control of
the game midway through the
second period —— going on a
27-9 run to take to a 53-48 half-

time bulge.

New Jersey threatened to
break the game wide open,
bursting to a 66-55 lead early in
the third quarter thanks to the
potent, dunk—fi1led transition
attack of Morris, Anderson and
Derrick Coleman.

The Cavs crawled back to
recapture the lead, 77-76, at the
end of the third. Cleveland
received an emotional lift from-
the play of former Pitt star
Jerome Lane, who chipped in
five points, three rebounds and
two scintillating assists in 10
minutes of action.

ECU

Continued from page 8
Pelt, but he fumbled at the
ECU 19.

0 Hackett continued to
fume on the sideline as he
witnessed ECU pull off a
fake punt in the third quar-
ter, despite the fact that
the Panther coaching staff
had prepared for it all
week — ECU has attempt-
ed a fake punt or field
goal in every game this
season. Hackett described
it as the key play in the
game.

With the Pirates in punt
formation at their own 38
yard line, they snapped it
to the up—man, Morris
Forman, who carried the
ball to the Pitt 43-yard line.

“They got us,” Hackett
said. “We talked all week
about their fakes, but they
got us. I’ll use the same
word — unacceptable.
That kind of thing hasn’t
happened to us this year.
Here, all of a sudden, it

happens. We have got to

get that straightened out.”

0 In fourth quarter with
the outcome of the game
still in doubt, Hupko fum-
bled a punt at his own 16-
yard line. East Carolina
turned this mistake into
three points. ,

0 On the ensuing kick-
off, Jay Jones fumbled.
Although Kevin Rock dove
on the ball to preserve the
possession for Pitt, it
amplified for Hackett the
problems on a return unit
that averaged a measly
10.4 yards.

“We have not gotten
anything at all from our
return game all year long,”
Hackett said. “But today, it
hurt us. It is unacceptable.
It is my responsibility, and
I will correct it.”

0 With Pitt down 30-17,
Van Pelt rolled right and

fired a pass to Davis. The.

ball bouncedoff his shoul-
der pad and floated into

the hands of ECU line-

backer Tony Davis. The
game was no longer in
doubt to the dozen fans
who bothered to stay

The Pirates turned that
stroke of bad luck into
seven points two plays
later when fullback Junior
Smith rumbled around the
left side for a 55-yard
touchdown.

Those mistakes nullified
any positives made by the
Pitt defense and have
given Hackett sufficient
reason to re-evaluate his
team.

“Our defense made a
step forward today, and it
was all wasted because we
just handed them the ball-
game,” Hackett said. “It’s

one thing to. go out and"

play your heart out and
not get the job done, but
today we gave them every
single opportunity in the
book, and that is unaccept- ‘
able.

“We have got to take a
real close look‘ at where
we are andwhere we are
going from here. I’m going
to take a close look at the
whole thing. I’m very dis-
appointed,” Hackett said.

What Hackett thought
would be a positive turn-
ing point for the Panthers
became a strong blow
backwards.

Besides the 17 points
that ECU scored immedi-
ate- ly following
Panther turnovers, the mis-
cues stopped the momen-
tum of an offense that was
able to move the ball well.

It also brings the psyche
of a fragile team to its low-
est point.

Not what Hackett wanted
when Pitt’s next game is in
one of the toughest
stadiums in college foot-
ball — the Syracuse Carrier
Dome.

“We have a very stiff
challenge because we have
all been in that dome,”
Hackett said. “It’s a very
hostile place to play. It is
also Halloween and their
colors are orange, so I’m
very concerned.”

All kidding aside, Pitt
has to hope that next week
it has some tricks of its
own and will cut down on

tiebreaker.

The Lady Panthers finally
came out on top in this
back—and-forth affair, win-
ning the tiebreaker 7-3. The
hard-fought victory raised
Pitt’s record to 6-3 on the
year.

, “The win [against IUP] was
very important for us,” Pitt
head coach George
Dieffanbach said.

“We really earned this
one.” —
Pitt played its final fall
match on Oct. 16 against
Youngstown State at the
Cost Center. This victory

came much easier, as Pitt,

won 7-1.

Youngstown’s top seed,
Julie LeMay, became
LoPrinzi’s latest victim.
LoPrinz_i completely over-
powered her opponent, tak-
ing the match in straight
sets (6-1, 6-0).

LoPrinzi’s victory set the
tone for a dominating Lady
Panther victory.

Pitt’s Nos. 2, 5 and 4 sin-
gles players blasted their
Lady Penguin opponents
with three consecutive,
straight-set victories. These
wins, combined with a
default win in No. 6 singles,
clinched the victory for Pitt
before the doubles round
even began.

In No. 2 singles, Baker
annihilated Cindi Lane of
Youngstown State (6-0, 6-2).
No. 3 Devins destroyed
Tarra Pavlosky (6-0, 6-2),

 

and Zielinski downed Jen
DiPasqua (6-2, 6-2) in the
No. 4 slot. Pitt’s Josie
Neiswenter won by default
in No. 6 singles.

Pitt’s only defeat of the
day came in No. 5 singles,
where Voda lost to Susie
Schwartz in a third-set
tiebreaker (6-2, 5-7, 7-6).

With the Pitt victory
already wrapped up, both
coaches agreed to play only
two doubles matches in a
pro set format. Pitt won
both matches 8-6. 4

The impressive 7-1 victory
gavethe Lady Panthers a 7-3
record for the fall season.
They are now guaranteed
their first winning record
since going 7-6 for the 1988-
’89 season.

“The key [to the 7-3 fall
record] was that we won
three of our matches by a
score of 5-4,” Dieffanbach
said.

“We worked on improving
fundamentals all season
we had good -teamwork
throughout the year
in our doubles matches,
which can often determine
the outcome in a close
match. I am very impressed
with our performance so
far.”

The Lady Panthers will
begin the fall season on
March 4 at home against
Cleveland State.

They will then travel
to St. Bonaventure on
March 20 and Buffalo on
March 28.
