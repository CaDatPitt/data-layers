T here's a way to drink beer that’s healthy and enjoyable, and there's a way to do it that’s dangerous and stupid. Today is traditionally a day when Pitt
students take one last moment to relax before studying, and The Pitt News would like you to do it right. And if you're under 21, just wait until you get

  

older —— we won't take you

Some students say Pitt ’s zero-tolerance policy for underage drinking would make them scared to get medical help for a friend.

Olivia Garber
Staﬁ Writer

Some students said Pitt’s zero-
tolerance policy toward under-
age drinking would keep them
from seeking medical help for
themselves or their intoxicated
friends. A V

Students shy of their 21st birth-
day will be cited for underage
drinking no matter the circum-
stances, even if they are seeking
medical attention, Pittpolice Com-
mander Francis Walsh said.

Kristi Rines, a 20-year old Pitt
sophomore", who said she didn’t
know of Pitt’s zero-tolerance poli-
cy, said that she probably wouldn’t
bring an intoxicated friend to the
hospital if it meant she would get
cited for underage drinking, an

offense that carries a ﬁne of up to
$500 or could require offenders to
participate in alternative alcohol
programs. ,
Rines said she’d call a sober
friend or someone who was 21 to

~ help.

man, offered anothersolution.

“I’d sit them in a wheelchair,
push them in [the hospital] and
run,” Wood said.

Walsh doesn’t agree that Pitt’s
zero-tolerance policy is a deter-
rentlfor seeking medical atten-
tion.

.“The deterrent is you have to
be 21 to drink,” Walsh said.

‘A tough decision’

Pitt’s zero-tolerance policy ex-
tends across Oakland to include
not only the residence halls but

also UPMC Presbyterian Hospi-
tal. A

Students living in residence
halls could also face citation if they
turn to resident assistants for help.
Colleen O’Connor, an RA in Tower
A and Pitt sophomore, said that if
an intoxicated student is brought
to the RA’s attention by a friend
who had also been drinking, both
students could face citation.

O’Connor called it a “tough
decision,” but said the RAs will
call the police when they believe
students are really sick.

' “Only when the police are
called do we write anything up,”
O’Connor said.

a O’Connor keeps a card that lists
alcohol poisoning symptoms in
her wallet to help her when decid-
ing whether or not to call police.

Signs of alcohol poisoning in-

clude: confusion; cold, clammy,
pale or bluish skin; low body tem-
perature; repeated, uncontrolled

vomiting; slow breathing; mental

confusion; stupor; coma; or an in-
ability to arousethe person.

O’Connor said that intoxicated,
underaged students who contact
an RA because they are concerned
about a friend will generally only
face punishment if they are also
at a noticeable level of intoxica-
tion that required the RA to call
the police.

“,Technically yes. They get writ-
ten up, but it’s better than leav-
ing [the friend] alone,” O’Connor
said.

John Hendershot, a campus po-
lice sergeant at Carnegie Mellon,
said hospitals don’t normally call
the police if someone brings in an
underage, intoxicated person.

Old dog, new tricks

Pitt’s Doggiri’ It brings the brews to Atwood Street

Drew Singer
Editor in Chief

So these guys from India decide they want to
open a beer distributor. V

It doesn’t work out — bureaucracy and
such —- so they decide they want to open a
bar. Long story short, that doesn’t work out,
either. '

So they bought some coolers.

“If I was religiously against it,” he said. “I
wouldn’t be selling it.” 9’

Patel grew up in Gujarat, a state in western
India. Another famous Indian is from there,
too. His name was Mohandas Gandhi, and
he wasn’t a big fan of alcohol. This situation
invariably ends with Gujarat becoming the

. only Indian state to ban alcohol.

Finding the store on Atwood Street might
be a bit tough. Other than a few beer lights
hanging in the window, there aren’t any signs,
and there is certainly no fancy awning with a

Three months later, Pitt’s Doggin’ It —— the
newest addition to the Atwood Street skyline
— offers upwards of 700 types of beer, and
that’s just phase one of the master plan. _

But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.

Rahul Patel, 30, and a few of his family‘
members —— all born in India —— were eat-
ing in Oa1dand’s India Garden one afternoon.
They noticed an empty storefront across the
street from Antoon’s Pizza with a “for sale”
sign in the window. Patel’s family, which has
some money thanks to a line of successful gas
stations along Route 51, decided to make afew
phone calls. _ I

“When I watch college movies, I realize that
kids like beer more than anything else,” he said.
“But we wanted to do something diﬁ'erent.”

Patel has worked for beer distributors in
the past. He’s also been a bartender and now
works his fair share of hours at Pitt’s'Doggin’
It. In other words, he knows his beer.

And oh by the way, Patel’s never had a drink
in his life. »

like you’d expect it to: a bunch of coolers ﬁlled
with a bunch of beers.

Pitt’s Doggin’ It prides itself on offering

1 pretty much any beer you can think of and is

known to take requests about the brands of
beer that it stocks. Besides the abnormally
large quantity of single bottles the store sells
—— its nicest ones are $20 per bottle — an-
other signature of the shop is its 12-packs,
many of which are 24—packs cut in half and
held together with masking tape. This strategy
doesn’t necessarily make its beers cheaper,
though (see chart, above).

In addition to beer, the store sells candy,
chips and other snacks.

And the  different name?

“Well,” Patel said, “We sell hot dogs.” There

I you have it.

CMU offers amnesty
for some underagers

Underage < 3

A worker at UPMC Mercy Hos-
pital emergency room Downtown,
who declined to be named, said
that the hospital will only call the
parents of an underage student
brought in for alcohol poisoning.

Students who go to UPMC
Presbyterian Hospital might not
have the same luck. Walsh said
the Pitt police have a detail set up
in the emergency room at UPMC
Presbyterian. Ofﬁcers will cite any
underage people who are in the
hospital and under the inﬂuence
of alcohol, even if they are seeking
medical attention, he said.

Walsh said that if students are
very sick, they should get medical
attention, even if it means they
might get in trouble. But he recom-
mended that underage students
not drink in the ﬁrst place.

Jim Ross, a 19-year old Pitt
freshman, called that idea
“bul1sh*t.”

“The reality is that it is going to
happen anyways,” Ross said.

Offering amnesty

Carnegie Mellon, located down
the street from Pitt’s campus, has
adopted a different policy for deal-
ing with the inevitable underage
drinkers. CMU has what Hender-
shot calls an “amnesty policy.”

This allows underage students
to seek medical attention for alco-
hol poisoning without fear of legal
ramiﬁcations.

“That policy is trying to prevent
people from not seeking medical
attention when they need it,” Hen-
dershot said.

Walsh stands by Pitt’s strict ad-
herence to the law, which he says
is the product of the University’s
zero—tolerance policy.

“What CMU does is what CMU
does. If we come in contact with
someone under the age of 21, and if
they have consumed alcohol, they
will get cited,” Walsh said. “It’s not
harsh. It’s the law.”

IT'S PRONOUNCED ‘LEE’

Malt forties provide palatable pairings

 
   

Lewis Lehe
Columnist

Last fall, I wrote a colurrm endorsing
4o—ounce malt liquors ~—forties, four
dawgs, fo-fos. Later, ﬁve dudes on abus
recognized me as the guy who wrote
the column aboutforties,whichIthink
makes it my most popular column ever.
Now, inmyﬁnalco1umn,Ire1:urntothe
subject, with reviews of forty ounces.

St. Ides

St. Ides has more endorsements
ﬁom dead musicians than any other
forty, with supporters including The
Notorious B.I.G., who appeared in
a St. Ides commercial, and Elliott
Smith, who wrote the song “St. Ides
Heaven.”

St. Ides has a shocking chemical
tangthat mighttake some gettingused
to, but it’s well worth the effort, andthe
practice helps hone a discriminat1'ng
palette. Strongnotes ofalcohol harmo-
nize playﬁilly with its smooth, malty
texture——acombinationthat’s perfect
on humid summer nights. Or pair St.
Ides with a fruit salad and a Black and
Mild for a light, rnid—morning brunch
in the sun.

Mickey’s

Malt liquor is the only species of
beverage that tries actively to int:imi—
date its customers, and the 1VIickey’s’
angry hornet mascot testiﬁes to this
trend. Despite the toughtalk, weighing
in at just 5.6 percent, Mickey’s packs

a lighter punch than other premium '

malt beverages. Mickey’s is accessible
but lacks character and resonance,
making this forty little more than an
introduction to the genre. Nonetheless,
I recommend Mickey’s as a charming
companion to popcorn.

Laser

Laserbills itselfasa“specialty malt
liquor,” with “specialt3f’ written in
italics to convey a reﬁned experience.
Subtle, without capitulating to meek-
ness, Laser exhibits discretion and
poise — an artful conservatism that
tempts the drinker to drink quickly
but rewards lingering contemplation.
Pause between sips to appreciate its
malty harmonics, and pair it with an
avocado for a rich backdrop to this
delicious dancing laser show.

Colt45 ,
Colt 45 is memorable, along with

Laser, forbeingnamed afteraweapon.
Billy Dee Williams, better known as
Lando Calrissian, better known as the
onlyAfricanAmerican inthe ﬁrstthree
Star Wars movies, endorsed Colt 45
in‘ a series of commercials where he
said, “Therearetwo rulesto remember
if you want to have a good time. Rule
number one: Never run out of Colt45.
Rule number two: Never forget rule
number one.” Truer words have never
been spoken.Aﬁ1ll—bodied swell offsets

mitnn maltbeveragewithaboomthat’s
impossible to ignore. Colt45 takes the
malt beverage concept to its logical
extreme — verging on an alcoholic
malt milkshake. Pair aColt45 with an
Argentine beef steak, Irish Potatoes
and a big fat Phillies Peach Blunt.

Four 0

Four 0 has the distinction ofbeing
the only beverage inthe world named
after its quantity. Four 0 is potent, with
a 10 percent alcohol content. Simple
multiplication means there are no less
thanfour ounces of alcohol inthe Four
0. The label is strongly reminiscent of
the album cover from “Snoop Dogg’s
Doggystyle,” just as the experience of
drinking a Four 0 is strongly reminis-

cent of the experience of recording
“Snoop Dogg’s Doggrstyle.”

Four 0 is less a beverage than a
journey. As a beverage, it is a catas-
trophe: The taste combines the worst
elements of box wine and beer. A few
sips emancipate fruittones alaFranzia
Sangria, but FourO loses these colorful
dashes — its only real grounds for an

original contribution to the genre —— A

in a ﬂood ofbitter defeata la The Red
Sea. As a journey, on the other hand,
Four 0 is a discount one—way ticket to
intoxication.

Some malt gourmets might give up
on Four 0, but it’s better to answer the
beverage’s challenge with a creative,
DIY remedy. Playto Four 0’s strengths,
and use it as the base foraBrass Mon-

the go-to fortyforaseasoned veteran,
although some malt gourmets have
remarked on its somewhat lackluster

Don’t let ‘whiskey d*ck’ getyou down

 
  
 

Leah Trimble
Columnist

We are in college. Drinking is abso-
lutely expected among students.

A Colorado State University study
showed that about halfof college stu-
dents engage inbinge drinking— hav-
ing ﬁve or more drinks in one night
— in a given two week period. Most
men who binge drink tend to have two
goals in mind: to getdrunkwith their
closest pals without getting arrested,
and to getlaidwhile keepingthe risk of
getting awoman pregnant or contract-
ing an STD as low as possible.

While these quests are more or less

in good ﬁin, the resulting reports of
these alcohol and hookup concoctions
make me question the success rate of
this mix. Besides the ant1'cipatedwarn—
ings that accompany the thought of

all random sex — lack of protection, ,

skewed perception and judgment,
STDs and well, STDs — consider an-
other issue at hand: “whiskey click,” a
condition in which a man has had too
much to drink and carmot, ahem, rise
to the occasion.

As Shakespeare wrote in Mac-
beth, liquor “provokes the desire but
ittakes away the performance.” Or he
comes out to watch the previews and
never actually gets to see the end of the
movie. Yes, it’s not an experience that

anyone wants to admit has happened
to him. But many of you have been in
asituationwherethishashappened or
have heard aboutanexperiencefroma
friend. Intense amounts of alcohol and
the male reproductive system don’t
mesh well together: Period.

UPMC erectile dysﬁinction spe-
cialist Dr. Thomasjaffe, M.D., said the
process is just alcohol doing its job.

“What alcohol constunption does
cause is a depression of your central
nervous system, which affects a male’s
abilityto have erections,” he said inan
e—mail. “This is caused because the
alcohol slows down or reduces your
body’s responses. It will take more
stimulationto get the bodyto respond

to the sexual stimulationthanitwould
if alcohol weren’t involved. The more
alcohol involved, the less like1yanerec-
tion can be achieved.”

In plain English, when the nerves
are stimulated, they signal blood to
increasingly ﬂow into the penis, al-
lowing it to become and remain, erect.
Alcohol halts both. Alcohol acts as a
depressant, making nerve endings
less responsive and therefore making
your usual heightened senses during
arousal absent from the equation. In
addition, the alcohol also dilates the
blood vessels. So when you eventually
getthe extraattention neededtoﬁnally
get erect, yourbloodvessels pull afast
one onyou andletthe blooddrainout,

allwhile kind oflaughing inyourface.I
mean, itwas your idiotic choice to take
those last few shots‘.
Theﬁinnythingisthatthese mighty,
mixed drinksare also passingalongthe
conﬁdence you needto makethe right
moves. You’re more likely to take risks
under the inﬂuence that you wouldn’t
otherwise. You are Superman. No one
can touch you. And you will succeed.
The trick is to know which drink will
take you from “I gotthis!” to not being

able to get any. There is no evidence as »

to how many games of pong will lead
you to the land of limp. .
By the time you reachthis point of
intoxication, I am assuming you have
already sealed the deal. You spentyour

money buyingdrinks. You’ve had that
heart-to—heart about nothing, which
seemingly meant somethingto both of
you. Your “target” has listened to your
bad jokes and the stories that won’t be

quite as interesting the next morning.

So you go home and start the action.

Then dun, dun, dun  Mr. Stiff decides

to not show up to the party.

At this point, you are considering
yourselfto be abig, fat, ﬂaccid failure.
Do not fret. This is a common occur-
rence. Your partner is either worried

that it’s his or her fault, relieved (sor-
ry...) or pretty darn irritated. I mean,
he or she is possibly sleeping in a for-
eign bed and risking awalk of shame.

The issue is that once you’ve entered —

the black hole of impotence, there’s
no returning. It’s over. You can pop a
blue pillinhopes itwillsalvage the situ—
ation (though everydoctorwill refrain
from recommendingacombination of
prescription drugs and alcohol), but
who keeps those on hand?

You have one choice. If your part-

ner’s relieved, turnoverand goto sleep.
Make sure that he or she gets the “good
pillow.” It’s well deserved.

The next option separates the
men from the boys: If your partner
is" still game for some sexual fun, be a
man and pleasure him or her. This is
not the time to be a selﬁsh lover and
pout because you lost your chance.
As a reward, they will be internally
congratulatingyou on your good man-
ners. And, notto be aDebbie Downer,
but it’s technically your own fault that

you can’t take part in the action. Don’t
punish the one that just came along
for the ride.

“The simple cure is not to drink
or to limit your consumption to one
alcoholic drink if you are planning on
havingintercourse thatnight,”Dr.Jaife
said. “If you have normal erections
and intercourse without alcohol and
diminished ones with it, you can see
that the answer is simple. In fact, let
me put it to you this way, an abuser of
alcohol isvery likelyto [have] erectile

dysfunction issues.”

Lesson to be learned: Watch what
you consume when you have goals in
mind. No one likes when these things
happen. If that isn’t a strong enough
argument, Dr. Jaffe warns men that
“over time, alcohol abuse can lead to
a change in the testosterone and es-
trogen levels inmale patients.” Maybe
staying in tonight is a good idea after
all.

BAR PROFILE

German froth overﬂows SouthSide  Works

Its ﬂagship restaurant ﬁlling mugs in Munich, Hofbrauhaus sells 1,300 liters of beer per day during Pittsburgh ’s Oktoberfest.

Kelsey Shea
Assistant A8rE Editor

With the clink of a mug and a fateful
stumble, a man falls off the bench
he’s standing on and spills his beer,
but he still manages to right himself
in time to belt the last few lines of
“Don’t Stop Believin’” with the rest
of the crowd.

After all, it’s Saturday night at
the Hofbrauhaus — a little spilled
beer is the last thing anyone’s wor-
rying about.

Pittsburgh’s own German beer
hall is the go-to place for weekends
in the Southside Works. Inside the
colossal building, guests stand on
the benches of long communal ta-
bles dancing, singing, swinging and
swigging their beers to the rhythm
of the house polka band’s renditions
of American classics.

The original Hofbrauhaus is lo-
cated in Munich, Germany. Pitts-
burgh boasts one of the restaurant’s
only three American locations (the
other two are in Cincinnati and Las
Vegas).

According to co-owner Eric
Haas, the riverside location of
Pittsburgh’s Southside Works was

the perfect spot for a German beer
hall.

“Pittsburgh is like Cincinnati.
There are a lot of people with Ger-
man heritage and a lot of people
who like to drink beer,” Haas said.
“Plus, it’s a great town.”

The Hofbrauhaus seats about
1,400 people between its lively
great hall, outside bier garden and
quiet side hall.

The restaurant also serves as a
brewery, churning out over 100 gal-
lons of its own beer each day. And
they need it — the restaurant can
sell that amount, if not more, on a
busy night. At last year’s Oktober-
fest, for example, the restaurant
sold over 1,300 liters in a single
day.

N In any given month the Hofbrau-
haus brews ﬁve different beers: four
standards — Wheat, Dunkel, Light
and its Premium Lager — and one
seasonal beer that changes each
month.

The man behind this frothy
golden magic is none other than
the Beer Master of the Hofbrauhaus
himself ——- Eckhard Kurbjuhn.

Kurbjuhn looks like the kind
of guy whoses earned the title of
Beer Master. Abig man with athick

German accent and a blunt sense of
humor, Kurbjuhn says his favorite
beer is the beer in front of him, and
that he’s made his “hobby into his

, profession.”

Born in a small town in northern
Germany, Kurbjuhn learned the art
of brewing as an apprentice at the
original Hofbrauhaus in Munich.
Kurbjuhn moved to America at the
insistence of the Pittsburgh estab-
lishment’s owners.

According to Kurbjuhn, Pitts-
burgh’s Hofbrauhaus is an authentic
experience. He said that other than
the American occupants and the
building itself(the original Hofbrau-
haus is 400 years old), the two beer
halls are very similar.

The menu features authentic
German dishes like bratwurst,
schnitzel and Schmanker-Platte.
The soft pretzels with bier cheese
are especially popular —— probably
because they compliment the beer,
which Kurbjuhn says he makes with
an original Munich recipe.

Kurbjuhn says Haas’ choice of
Pittsburgh was smart. He says busi-
ness is booming, and the beer hall
isn’t going anywhere.

“You Pittsburghers, you drink a
lot of beer,” he said.

SOCIAL AnA|.vs|s

College society ’ s favoring beer lovers unjust

For those like Sam whose palates don’t tingle at the first drop of brew, collegiate party life is a bit difficult.

Samantha Stahl
Columnist

A There are two types of people in this
world — those who enjoy beer and i

those who merely tolerate it in the

most desperate of buzz—deprived

situations.

As one of the latter, I ﬁnd the
self-contained world of college to be
heavilyin favor of the beer-chugging
subset. It’s not fair.

but it’s not much of a bargain when

I’m not consuming anything.

Long ago, when I spent my Friday .

nights in dimly lit basements instead

of the bar, ~.I_ could spend an entire ‘

night attempting to drain just one
red Solo Cup.

_Do you have any ideahow expen-
sive it is to.be a non—beer drinker?
You have to pay for vodka and mix-
ers, or tequila and limes if it’s a spe-
cial occasion.

Well, since you asked, beer has

bad decisions, but we won’t get into

I was forced to hide my distaste
for beerlast weekend when my
friends hosted their third annual
Brewfest, an all-day Beer Olympics
tournament in which hatred for beer,
is a punishable offense.

Generally I shy away from play-
ing games like beer pong because
it results in people teasing me for

aiming at a table on the other side
of the room, or hitting the opposing
players more than the cups.

But I ﬁgured, hey, why not. I only
have two weeks left as a college stu-
dent, and after graduation there are
not a whole lot of socially acceptable

A opportunities to be an aggressive

beer ball player.

So I spent 10 hours participating
and you knowwhat? By the end Iwas
actually drinking beer by choice. It
ﬁgures that now, just as I head out
into thereal world, where Natty no
longer exists and I’m expected to
start drinking martinis andgred wine,
I’ve actually started to come around
to beer. .

I guess that’s what college is real-
ly about — gaining exposure to and
appreciation for that about which we
were previously ambivalent.

Come graduation, I’ll know my
education was a success if I can walk
up tothe bar and say, “A pitcher of

IS IT All M5 at A metal .

Many beer novices, when ordering beer, will ask

their server for “a lager" or “an ale." Most of the
time, all goes well and they receive the Yuengling
th”ey.were craving. However, lager and ale are
actually not very descriptive. It is unlikely that by
ordering a lager or an ale that you will actually
get what you want. See — unlike India Pale Ales
or Stouts ——- lagers and ales are grouped
exclusively by brewing style, not by taste or
character. - V
Lagers are fermented at colder temperatures

(less than 10 degrees Celsius) with bottom
fermenting yeasts for longer periouds of time.
Ales are fermented at warmer temperatures (10
to .15 degrees Celsius) with top—fermenting
yeasts for shorter? periods of time. The
fermentingeprocess often reﬂects how these ’
beers are typically consumed. Lagers are often
drunk; right out of the freidge —cold as the
Rockies. Ales taste best, many argue, at room

‘ temperature.’ .

DRINKING ANALYSlS

Beer hang: The art of ‘just letting it go in’ _

Kiercm vows to ﬁnally complete his flTSt beer bong before he puts on the cap and gown.

Kieran Layton
A8rE Editor

Like an ancient Roman emperor, I stand
perched atop a wobbly chair in a forlorn
basement, holding a valuable artifact — a
ﬂuorescent orange cone with caution tape
wrapped around it, the word “Betty” scrawled
in thick black marker strokes and a long, 4-foot
tube that extends down and out of the neon
funnel.

Below me, a young man caked in sweat
and ale grips the tubing and bends the end up,
creating a U—shaped curve. He nods.

I crack opena can of sweet nectar —- Coors
Light — and slowly pour it into the funnel. I
watch it cascade down the clear plastic tubing
with the grace of a herd of liquid stallions. As
I swish the foam, the young man positions his
mouth close to the tubed apparatus.

“Ready,” he says.

I take a deep breath, mentally preparing
myself for the task at hand. I gesture as to
silence the crowded room and close my eyes.
It is now or never; a young man’s sobriety -—
and his pride — are at stake.

“Lovely lady lumps,” I bellow, and in less
than three seconds, the beer disappears from
the funnel and tubing, the crowd erupts, and I
look on in awe at the completion of one of the
most proud beer-related accomplishments:
Bonging abeer.

I hide my shame well, however, because I
have never — and am still currently unable
to — bong a beer.

When one ﬁrst begins enjoying beer on
a regular basis — whether it is after only
one ice-cold brewski or a period where one
“acquires a taste for it” — there are certain
tasks one must complete to prove his beer
worthiness.

They range from the mild (prowess at table
games like ﬂip cup and beer pong) to the en-
gaging (shotgunning) to the mack daddy of
them all — the beer bong.

The act of taking a thick piece of tubing
into one’s mouth, hearing the “Go” word and
letting a surge of beer hit the back of your
throat and shoot straight down into your
stomach is the pinnacle of hard-partying
status. It is an efficient way to get buzzed,
and its ﬂashy nature makes it appealing to
potential mates. And yet I have never been
able to successfully do it. ’

That isn’t to say I haven’t tried. There have
been countless occasions where I have faced
the mighty bong in preparation of glory, only
to sputter and choke as my throat rejected the

intimidating force of the Natty Light trying to
shove its way into my stomach.

Friends have tried to help me. “Don’t try
swallowing it —— just let it go in,” might be
the most unhelpful piece of advice I have re-
ceived. Because yes, I did try to “let it go in”
but my throat closed, and I almost vomited

everywhere.

“No, no, you have to open your mouth,
open your throat, and it will just go down,”
they insist. _

No, no — I just almost vomited again, and
I got the last half of that beer all over my shirt
and jeans. I am shamed.

Now, my inability to bong beers is a co-
nundrum, as I have nearly mastered the art of
chugging and shotgunning. At a recent Beer

Olympics event —~ all the glory of the real
Olympics, none of the archery or badminton
— I chugged a beer in almost 10 seconds, and
I have a special technique for shotgunning that
encourages minimal time lapse and maximal
showmanship.

One would think, then, that I would be a
natural at beer bonging. But alas, I am hope-
less. Just the thought of standing under the
holy relic of college parties and taking one

Therefore, I am going to make it my soli-

tary goal to complete a successful beer bong‘

by graduation — which arrives in almost one
week — so I can rid my self of my Bong Anxi-
ety. Classes? Psh, my dignity is at stake here.

So if you see me at a party and there is a
bong nearby, let me have at it. I need to gradu-
ate to a new level of beer drinker.

BEER PONG

Shockers take Alley
championship

Tonyjovenitti
Sports Editor

Shockers defeated the Hairy Bea-
vers 2-1 in a three—game series to
win the Championship of the Alley
last weekend.

In the third and deciding game
of the beer pong series, both mem-
bers of the Shockers made the ﬁnal
cup, eliminating any chance of re-
demption for the Hairy Beavers.

The Shockers, which consisted
of Iraq war veteran "Roy Murrman
and Pitt senior Caroline Conroy,
used Conroy’s excellent shooting
to dispose of the Hairy Beavers,
which consisted of North Oakland
resident Allie Mader and Pitt junior
Shane Drennen.

Alley beer pong is different from
normal beer pong in that the table
is not a table — it’s a door.

An old door rests on an end

table, which itself rests on a couch
that the residents of this South
Oakland house found on a curb in
front of a frat house and brought
home. The door is supported by the
railing of the house’s side porch.

“The railing adds a whole new
dimension to the game,” Drennen
said.

House rules state that any ball
which bounces off the railing and
back into the cup shall count as two
cups, and Conroy took advantage
of that.

In her second shot of the third
game, Conroy took a seemingly
normal aim at the cup. It bounced
off the inside rim of a cup in the
second row, hit the railing and
splashed into the cup.

Conroy found success in the
Solo Cups all night and was named
Alley MVP. She made 11 of her 47,
or 23 percent, of her shots during
the night.

from Oklahoma).

“I think Dickerson has the athleti-
cismto be a goodtight end depending
on where he is picked,” Reedy said. “I
also like the fact that he played a vari-
ety of positions at Pitt and has more
upside.”

IfDickerson hadhisway, he would
prove to analysts he could handle
blocking with a weight room show-
down.

“The Gresham’s and the guys who
ranthe spread offenses, Iwilltake any-
one into the weight room and show
them what I can do on the bench,”
Dickerson said. He bench pressed
225 pounds 24times at the NFL Com-
bine.

Asfaraswhichteam’sweight room
he’ll grace atthis year’s trainingcamp,
that’s where Dickerson leaves it up to
chance.

“It’s been interesting to me to sit
here, because all the teams have been
saying the same thing, ‘We’ll be really
interested come draft day,”’ Dicker-
son said. “It’s been kind ofhard to tell
an ' gabout the draft. I don’tl<n'ow
where I’m going to go.”

He did, however, narrow down
a list to three teams he felt were the

 

 

THE ITT NBS

for complete list

most interested in him: the Washing-
ton Redskins, Arizona Cardinals and
Baltimore Ravens.

Yet, as early as Wednesday morn-
ing, Reedywas reporting that Dicker-
son was on a list with Gresham and

‘former Florida tight end Aaron Her-

nandez as the Cincinnati Bengals’ top
three considerations attight end. The
same report mentions that Dickerson

could go as high as round two in the
« draft.

Dickerson saidhe’s beentold hewill
be drafted somewherebetweenrounds
two and four. Either way, his former
position coach is conﬁdent he’ll be a
nightmare for defenses in the NFL.

“He’s just going to get better. His
ceilingis highbecause he hasn’tplayed
the positionverylong,” Pitttight ends
coach Brian Angelichio said. “From a
speed standpoint, he’s going to be a
matchup problem for any lineback-
er.”

Dickerson said he’s been talking
withformer Pitt offensive lineman C._].
Davis and linebacker Scott McKi]lop
among others aboutbeing drafted, and
he received the same message: Relax,
and have fun on draft day.

That’s why he plans on enjoying

the NFL Draft at his uncle’s house in
Moon, Pa., surrounded by family and
close friends. But the nerves might be
too much for him to cope with.

“I don’t know what I’ll do while ev-
eryone is sitting there watching and
having fun,” Dickerson said. “I might
justgo forawalkorsomethingbecause
I don’t want to be around everyone
while it’s happening.”

Yet uncertainty is nothing new to
Dickerson. After all, tight end is his
ﬁfth position in four years. He’s also
played wide receiver, ﬁillback, halfback
and linebacker. A

It seems once he enters the NFL,
he’s poised to face it again.

“What I did to overcome all the

adversity [at Pitt], I’ll just keep that 

my back pocket. I’m prepared for it,”
Dickerson said. “If it happens again,
then I’ll know how to deal with it bet-
terthis time.”

Whether it’s round one or round
four, Dickerson plansto ﬁndahome in
the NFL. He doesn’t care which posi-
tion, so longas he gets to hisﬁnal goal:
a Super Bowl ring.

Sports are just as
exciting sober

Littman 4 14

you’re surrounded by it, and there’s a good
chance your buddies will down some of
the devil’s nectar if you watch with other
people. But even when you’re alone watch-
ing sports, alcohol is there.

Just last year, the NBA.repealed an 18-
year ban on courtside advertising for al-
cohol, so now alcohol ads can be seen on
camera throughout the game. In 2003, the
alcohol industry spent more than $879
million on television advertising, with
more than $540 million going toward ads
that run during sporting events, according
to the Center on Alcohol Marketing and
Youth. In 2006, Anheuser—Busch spent
more than $252 million to advertise during
sporting events, roughly 77 percent of its
total ad spending for that year, accord-
ing to Street and Smith’s Sports Business
Journal.

No matter the
reason, don’t get
pressured into
drinking something
you don’t want to.

There’s just no way to watch sports on
TV and not see ads for beer. If you’re not in-
terested in beer, you learn to ignore them,
like the ads for gentlemen’s clubs in sports
sections of most newspapers (by the way,
how’s it going down there, ad for Blush?
Thanks for your continued support).

It is hard to ignore, though. My lips have
touched beer exactly the same amount of
times they’ve touched the’ lips of Norah
Jones, which is to say — fortunately for her
—— not once. Still, I know college students
looking to get a lot of cheap beer for their
sports-watching enhancement will fre-
quently go with Natural Light. Coors Light
is for those who like football, some good
dude camaraderie and twins. Others will
drink Pabst Blue Ribbon while ironically
watching some bizarre, non-mainstream
sport, like the WNBA.

But the truth is, being a sports fan who
doesn’t drink is like being one who does,
just with less alcohol consumption.

That’s not to say I haven’t come in con-
tact with alcohol at sporting events either.
My earliest memory comes from when I

was 12 years old at Yankee Stadium. Lost
in the euphoria of glorious live baseball
action, I felt a few drops of liquid sprinkle
the back of my neck. I ﬁgured it was prob-
ably just starting to drizzle.

A few minutes later, my nostrils caught
an unpleasant odor coming from above. I
took off my hat and noticed dots all over it.
I asked my Dad if it had rained, he said it
hadn’t and then smelled my hat, conﬁrm-
ing someone from behind spilled beer on
me. For some, beer raining from the sky
would be welcome —— their equivalent of
how The Weather Girls feel when it rains
men. For me, it was an inconvenience. I
prefer when it rains rain.

One thing all non—drinkers have to deal
with is the question, “Why, oh why would
you deny yourself such sweet tonic? Who
wouldn’t want to down a few bottles of this
marvel of society, this magical elixir that
loosens the stiff, boogies the undanceable
and sleeps with the unattractive?” Note: I
only associate with overly dramatic pre-
tentious people.

Well, there are countless reasons. Here
are some of the most widely used’ ones
I’ve heard:

You might not like being drunk. Per-
haps it’s a health issue,lor you simply
don’t like the taste. Maybe you’re preg-
nant. Or you’re playing famed Mormon
Marie Osmond in a biopic, and you’re a
method actress. Perhaps you’re taking
medication for your skin that can be fatal
when mixed with alcohol. You feel cocaine
goes better with sports watching. Maybe
you’re a recovering alcoholic. Or you’re
playing famed Mormon Donny Osmond
in a biopic, and you’re a method actor.
Perhaps you simply don’t have any desire
to drink alcohol.

No matter the reason, dQ_n’t get pres-
sured into drinking something you don’t
want to. Sure, it might feel a little awkward
when everyone has those cool long-neck
bottles or when you see how few Poland
Springs commercials air during the Super
Bowl.

But that’s okay. Regardless of what
commercials or bar patrons might say,
not drinking alcohol doesn’t make you
any less of a sports fan or a dude. It might
make you a permanent designated driver,
but that’s it. _

So non-drinkers, don’t worry when
you’re around people who react like the
guy from the, Red Stripe commercials when
it’s time to start drinking. Ask for a water,
laugh off some verbal jabs, and enjoy the
game. There’s always the chance that you’ll
be the only one to remember it.

She would have only needed 46 shots,

but in the middle of the third game, the ball
swirled around the rim of the cup. Drennen

, quickly reached forward and tipped the ball
out of the cup with his right index ﬁnger.

Conroy shouted in frustration.
“I ﬁngered it,” Drennen said. “Guys ﬁnger,
girls blow. House rules.” '

But on the next shot, Conroy made the"

same cup on a perfectly placed shot.

“Finger that, Shane Drennen,” she
said. I ‘

Drennen made 10 of his 48 shots on th
evening for a shooting percentage of 21.

After the series, Drennen asked Conroy
if her back hurt. .

he said. i .

Murrman, who returned from Iraq in
September, shot_a dismal 7 percent from
behind the table. He only made three of his
46 attempts. _

He was the worst shooter of the four

I contestants, but Mader didn’t beat him by
much. She made four of her 45 shots for a A

shooting percentage of 9.
The‘ series-deciding game looked des-

C tined for overtime,‘ as both teams opted for ‘

a “power—I” formation, putting their three

remaining cups in a straight line, or a “coke
line,” as Mader called it.-

The Championship of the Alley was
founded in 2010, when the Shockers and
the Hairy Beavers realized they needed to
come up with a name for their alley beer
pong games. '

The Shockers were elated after the win.
Conroy leapt into her boyfriend’s arms, and
the two shared a celebratory kiss. '

“I didn’t graduate with honors,” Conroy
said. “But at least I won alley beer pong.”
