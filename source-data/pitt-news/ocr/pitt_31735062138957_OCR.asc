BYRON KING SPEAKS .
TO THE STUDENTS

(Continued from Page 1)

This aroused me a little
and I replied that I was glad to getto
Philadelphia, as it was such a nice.
quiet little town to rest in.”

l
The fact that material gain is not

the greatest thing to look forward to
in life waslclearly brought out by the
speaker. He said, “Service is the
great thing. To live to help others
to live is the greatest thing a man
can do in this world. If I were to be
given a million dollars to—rlay by sim-
ply signing my name to a paper, with
the condition that I must look after
the investing of that money. I would
refuse the million. I, want -to have

time to get in touch with liumanity,

and do not care to spend my life
looking after a thing that will beneﬁt
only myself.

Dr. King told of his trials and hard-
ships when he first came to Pitts-
burgh many years ago. Said he:
Wheii I came to Pittsburgh I could
not speak well at all. I stanimered
and was at a disadvantage in ‘many
ways. My only wish was to be able
to speak and my wish was fulﬁlled.
I believe any one can attain what he

desires in this life if he will only bend

FIRST GAMES PLAYED
IN NEW LEAGUE

Economics and Mines Defeated by
College and Research—Great
Umpiring.

“Play ball,” yelled the official um-
pire for the
league, and the Pitt baseball season
was on in earnest. It was just about
three o’clock Monday afternoon when
the deep voice of the umpire called
the Economics men and the College
men to battle at Ormsby park. This
game was the first real contest of the
season, everythingiin the way of
practice before having been indoors
or one or two working-a little out-
side.‘ Coach McCreery sat on the
bench lines, taking in every move-
ment of the two teams.

Asoft ﬁeld made the ﬁelding of
both teams a little slow. Not many

new inter—department

sensational stunts were pulled off, but:

both teams ﬁelded in fair shape, con-
sidering the fact it was the lirst time
the players had been out. i

A tendency to try to knock the
cover‘ off the ball and over anxiety to
make a ‘hit caused many of the play-
ers to walk back to the bench with <1
disgusted look. But as Coach Mc-

A large number of candidates an-

always been kind to Pitt athletes as
he has ordered special kwork done each
