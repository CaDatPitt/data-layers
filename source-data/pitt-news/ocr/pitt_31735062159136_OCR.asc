5,000 American Youths
Start On Pilgrimage 
To Insure Rights S

By RAY C. MMBINTYRE

‘When upwards of 5,000
American young people of all
1' :1 c e s , nationalities, creeds,
classes, and, it is suggested,
“previous conditions of servi-
tude” make their onslaught
against \Vashington on March
10, 11, and 12 in a Youth ’s Pil-
grimage sponsored by the Amer-
ican Youth Congress, the del-e-
gates will, if one is to judge by
their program, attempt to give the
lie to an ancient tradition that
America is the land of ideal free-
dom and opportunity.

They will endeavor to convince
the worthy senators and represen-
tatives that the present NYA pro-
gram is inadequate to meet the
needs of American Youth today,
and will try to persuade these
gentlemen among other things
that the American Youth Act,
which would “broaden the NYA
to give more jobs, educational and
vocational training to young peo-
ple,” is desirable, even necessary
—almost compulsive, as a matter
of untarnished, unpleasant every-
day fact.

One Of Three

And in support of their pro-
gram the youth representatives
will undoubtedly bring up such
mildly appalling little bits of in-
formation as that provided by the
Division of Social Work at the
University; that for every three
youths in America of high school
age who are attending high school,
two are not attending.

Startling also will be the illu-
minating disclosure that from ﬁve
to eight million youths of ages
from 16 to 25 are neither in school
or at work. Three to four million
of these are of high school age,
while 22 per cent of the idle
group have never had work.

Furthermore, 2,225,000 neophy-
tes each year enter the competition
for jobs, ﬁve per cent having ﬁn-
ished college, 45 per cent high
school and vocational schools, and
about 50 per cent having dropped
out of high school before gradua-
tion.

In face of the drastic need said
to be made evident by facts like
these, it is pointed out that the
NYA is now working on an appro-
priation of 50,000,000 dollars.
Those who would see this sum en-
larged indicate a discrepancy be-
tween the amount here spent and
the 800,000,000 or so dollars be-
ing, in their own language “tossed
away on battleships.”

Oppose Reduction

Because the 75,000,000 dollar
appropriation originally made by
Congress to the NYA, was cut
down by one-third, the American
Youth Act votaries insist that im-
mediate action must be taken by
those affected to forestall any
further reduction.

Other bills on the roster for
consideration are: the Swennen-
bach-Allen Resolution, under
which unemployed unable to ﬁnd
work in private industry would
be guaranteed work on WPA proj-
ects; the Harrison-Fletcher-Black
Bill, providing funds to assist
states and territories in public
education; the Bernard Bill on the
CCC calling for demilitarization of
that agency; and the Kye—Kvale
Bill, refusing public aid to edu-
cational institutions countenanc-
ing compulsory ROTC. .

The Pilgrimage will oppose the
Sheppard-Hill and all industrial
mobilization plans which, it is as-
serted, will “provide for a war-
time dictatorship of industry, ed-
ucation, unions and the press.”

Panhel Contest
Closes Today

Entries for the Panhellenic
Song Contest must be in the of-
ﬁce of the dean of women by 5
o’clock this afternoon, announces
Ruth Custer, C39, chairman of the
song committee.

Songs are to be of two types:
one formal and one informal. Each
fraternity may submit not more
than two’ songs.

Six faculty members will serve
as judges: Miss Thyrsa W. Amos,
dean of women; Carl’ B. Cass, as-
sistant professor of English; Theo-
dore M. Finney, director of music;
Dr. Lotte Lohstoeter, assistant
professor of modern languages;
Miss Ellen Geyer, professor of
English and education; and Dr. Al-
fred Wolfe, associate professor of
biology.

Winning songs will be mimeo-
graphed for the next mass meet-
ing, March 21.

tunities in Rural Nursing,” Miss

ing and director of the Mary Mc-
Clellan School of Nursing at Skid-
more college, will address a lunch-
eon meeting in Heinz House at

The purpose of Miss Gelinas’
talk is to help orient nurses and
prospective nurses working on de-
gree programs at the University.

Dr. Charles E. Prall, dean of the
School of Education, who has ar-
ranged today’s program with the
help of several cooperating agen-
cies, announces that the luncheon
is open to anyone interested in
nursing education.

Peter Bent Brigham Hospital
School of Nursing in Boston, and
holds a master’s degree from Co-
lumia university. She has also
served as an instructor and as a
director of nursing education at
[several institutions prior to her
present position, and is active in
national and state nursing associa-
tions.

Some of these students are grad-
uate nurses pursuing part-time-
in-service programs; others are on
a cooperative course arranged be-
tween the Magee hospital and the
School of Education; still another
group is enrolled in a recently in-
augurated ﬁve-year curriculum in
the College.

Ttickets for the luncheon may
be obtained “at the oﬁice of the
School of Education or from Miss
Louis M. Austin, instructor of

cents as was erroneously reported
in Friday’s News.

Players Book
Social Affair

 With Debaters

Although they have been to-
gether in the same office for sev-
eral years, Pitt Players and Men’s
Debating Association have never
met socially.

The difficulty is to be remedied
soon, according to an announce-
ment today from the respective
heads of the groups. Date for the
remedy is_ Wednesday, March 16,
and the scene is to be the ﬁrst
combined Pitt Players-Debating
Association tea dance.

As site for the tea dance, the
dramatic and debate groups are
to have the Hotel Schenley ball-
room. Helen Ackerman, C38, chair-
man of the committee in charge
of arrangements, said that her
committee was planning the larg-
est ﬂoor show on record for a tea
dance. This would include, she
said, “The Commodores,” a trio
of harmonizing young gentlemen.

In addition to being the ﬁrst
dance sponsored by the combined
Players-debate groups, Miss Aker-
man said the dance would witness
several other “firsts,” to be an-
nounced later. The orchestra for
the dance has not yet been se-
lected.

Members Of Faculty Indicate
Spring Revival Of Local Trade

By IRVING KAUFMAN

Although business conditions
continue to wallow, facts and
opinions gathered in separate con-
fences with informed observers on
the faculty indicate that the re-
cession is leveling off and that a
spring revival is likely.

Dr. Charles S. Tippetts, dean of
the. School of Business Adminis-
tration, and Dr. Marion M. Mc-
Kay, professor of economics, ad-
vanced opinions and discussed
facts to substantiate these opin-
ions.

ONLY 9 MORE DAYS
To ORDER YOUR
1938 OWL

Although declining to prophe-
sy, Dr. Ralph J. Watkins, director
of the Bureau of Business Re-
search, pointed out the magnitude
of the recession and then gave
statistics which indicate that it is

leveling out.

Discussing favorable factors,
Dr. McKay listed the possibilities
for a spring recovery under four
main headings. These points are
(1) the coming spring season; (2)
governmental attempts to loosen
credit; (3) the anticipated housing
boom; and (4) gradual reduction
of overstocked inventories.

Dr. McKay pointed out that the
spring season usually is the time
for the revival of heavy indus-
tries. In connection with the sec-
ond point, governmental efforts,
he discussed the new allotment to
the WPA, and the resumption of
loans to industry. by the Recon-
struction Finance Corporation and
by the Federal Reserve Banks.

Outstanding among the unfav-
orable factors discussed by Dr.

named are Ruth Custer, C39, wo-

Undergrads

Phi Kappa Leads
Other Chapters
With Seven Men

: Forty-two men pledged to 13
University fraternities during
silence period last week, it was
announced today by Robert R.
Corley, assistant dean of men.

Phi Kappa led the list with
seven pledges, while three other
fraternities, obtained ﬁve pledges
each. These three were Kappa
Sigma, Kappa Alpha Phi, profes-
sional business fraternity, and Sig-
ma Chi.

Pledging results showed four
men each for Phi Gamma Delta
and Pi Kappa Alpha, and three for
Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Added to
Pi Lambda Phi, Phi Epsilon Pi,
and Theta Chi were two men for
each. Delta Tau Delta, Phi Delta
Theta, and Sigma Alpha Mu each
pledged one man.

LESS THAN LAST YEAR

The 42 pledges this semester
represent a decrease of eight from
the total of last February, when 50
men were pledged. However, the
total is still higher than that of
any other mid-year period since
1933, when 52 men were pledged.

This year the 13 social fraterni-
ties issued 127 invitations to
pledge, and had over 33 per cent
accepted. The total accepted in
February, 1937, was slightly under
30 per cent.

In 1934 and 1935, fraternities
pledged 35 men during the mid-
year rushing period. In 1936 there
were 39 and last year there were
50. Sigma Alpha Mu led the fra-
ternities last year with ten pledges.

To Hold Local

Youth Conclave

lGroup Will Organize
Support For March
To Washington, D. C.

Pitt Peace Council will sponsor
an open meeting tomorrow at
12:30 o’clock in 129 Cathedral, to
discuss needs of local youth, and
to organize support for the pil-
grimage to Washington to be held
under the auspices of the Amer-
ican Youth Congress.

Dr. Marion Hathway, associate
professor of social work at the
University, and Miss Sara Filner,
secretary of the Western Pennsyl-
vania division of the American
Youth Congress, will speak on the
present status of youth and will
outline ways of improving their
lot.

Both speakers will place special
emphasis on local conditions, pre-
senting ﬁgures on educational
standards here. “We have plen-
ty of room for improvement,” Dr.
Hathway said yestrerday, “but
certainly a policy of disinterest is
not the way to do it. Such a meet-
ing as this is indeed an encourag-
ing sign of student concern.”

Special effort will be made to
gain the support of students to
join the youth pilgrimage to
Washington. Members of the Pitt
Peace Council, The Pitt News, and
the YMCA have already indicated
they will participate.

The American Youth Congress
predicts an attendance of approx-
imately 5,000 delegates to the pil-
grimage.

pha, in charge of decorations.

The kites will be decorated with
spring flowers and apparently
supported by March winds. They
will be attached to the all-point
trophy to signify striving of the
fraternities for the award. The
ballroom will be lighted with in-
direct lights to create a "spring-
like atmosphere.

Spear is an experienced decora-
tor, having been in charge of dec-
orations for the Yuletide festival
last Christmas and other school
dances.

tra, featuring Eddie Scope as vo-
calist, will play for the dance,
from 10 to 2 o’clock. Ray Nord-

The Red Feather
Turns Pink

ESULTS of this years Community Fund
drive were announced through the News
as “highly satisfactory.” The original quota,
according to the tabulation of cash and pledge
contributions, had been passed, and it was be-
lieved that students had become aware of their
responsibility. It was declared that their re-
sponse was unusually commendable.

But, unknown to the student body, is the fact
that after each drive the directors of the Fund
on campus spend several weeks in completing
the records of contributions and in obtaining
the moneys promised by the pledges.

According to information received today, it
is discovered that the original ﬁgures as re-
leased are inexact. It is discovered that, since
a large number of the pledges have back-
tracked, the quota has not’ been reached.

l'<‘r-.rtl1er1i1ore, we learn that, following the
l‘Ill’)lll'cll«l()ll of cash in hand and pledges, a
budget was made out to the organizations on
campus sharing in the proceeds of the drive.
And now, since a significant number of students
who have pledged have not contributed, the
beiieﬁciarics of the Fund may be forced to slice
their budget.

There may be several explanations. Possibly
the students have forgotten. Possibly they
have changed their minds and their philan-
thropies. Possibly they never intended to re-
mit for their pledges, but, under the enthusi-
asm of wearing the red feather, decided to
pledge for the sake of appearances.

The News is not printing the names of the
people who pledged but who did not remit.
The News is suggesting, simply, that pledged
donations may be turned into the treasurer’s
office or at the Y ofﬁce at G26 Cathedral at

01108.

This ’n’ That:

We are always noticing resemblances between
people. Our latest is one from the cover of the
Ladies Home Journal, for February. It looks re-
-markably like Rosemary Lutz—and the model is
"very pretty. So what ? ? ? . . Headline from a

Journal in Terrific Buying Spree” . . .

Did you know or do you
remember that Homer (Play-

“(Advice to the Lovelorn) Hal-
lam of the Sun-Tele were linked
or rumored to go to one of the
bigger dances on campus, which
fell thru . . and to top things

that her name not be linked with

Gray Weller is currently drifting with a. P.C.W.
lady, who answers to Weller’s coos as Berle Bahr,

mained at home because of her pater’s illness.

D. C. Shultz, the kid in the three—cornered pants,
looking nice and rosy at the C. A., with the very
nifty Harriet Glasser . . . Tommy Smith, Panther
chief, has abandoned the Wisconsin throb and the
Northside nurse--perhaps, just perhaps—-for fashion

You’ll ﬁnd out little about Mae West in Every
Day’s a Holiday that you didn’t know before, least
of all why she rated a $350,000 income last year.

Miss West struts and insinuates her way through
the familiar beery tale of a woman who lives by
her wits and has a kind heart. She skips town for
a while (you know how those things are) but she
comes back, disguised as a favorite of the French
stage. '

Afterthis, she comes through for her man Ed-
mund Lowe and the mustachioed Lloyd Nolan is
foiled again. Mixed in ‘throughout are some excel-
lent comedians——Winninger, Catlett, and Butter-
worth——who do their best to sustain the comedy
interest.

Frankly, I .had a hard time keeping track of the
plot. I kept wondering whether or not it is true
that Miss West’s umph is really padding. And you
know how disconcerting a thought like that is,
especially in her case.

(I think I shall drop around to the Casino, which
is currently advertising Frank Wallace, the man
who sued Mac to prove that he was her legal hus-
band. The ads say: He tells all—Mae’s Loves, Ro-
mances, Heartaches, Intimate Details of Her Life
Never Before Exposed! Ladies, Here’s Your
Chance to Get The Real Lowdown on Diamond Lil.)

The Stanley stage show is all right. It features
Barney Rapp and his New Englanders and Billy

Gilbert, a funny man who sneezes for a living.

This show has a “family” program for people who
are not rich, and not poor, who just enjoy them-
selves with their little circle of friends. One ﬁlm,
Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo, ﬁnds Cholly Chan
among the roulette tables. With the help of his
Number One Son and a French gendarme (who
understands English), Chan traces the murderer
who has stolen $1,000,000 in bonds.

Chan is losing his grip, though. It is not until
the very end of the pictures that he discovers how
a pretty blond, who gave up her job as a manne-
quin in London, can wear rhinestone shoes and dash
around in a Hispana-Suisa, on an “invisible in-
come.” A

The other picture, Borrowed Trouble, tells of the
efforts of the members of the Jones family (all eight
of them) to reform a kid who lives above a pool-
room and cuts school.

Hollywood makes a lot of these pictures to ﬁll

out double bills.

Let The Workers Speak
“Your Majesty,” Daphne began, “Your Majesty, I per-

sonally think you’re rather foolish about it all.

You know

you’re not going to accomplish anything.”

“VVell, Daphne, I’m not so sure that we won’t.

After all,

when you bring all the little workers of the country together

for consultation, it at least ought to be interesting.
Daphne disjoined her mandibles and yawned.

The Queen Ant smiled. “No,
really, I don’t. But at any rate
the workers will keep quiet after
we give them a chance to speak.
And we might have some peace
for a week or two.”

The meeting was called to or-

Queen’s reception hall, just off the
main legislative Catacomb. Sev-
eral hundred workers, short and
scrawny people, were seated to-
gether, jibbering in monotone.
Presently the chamberlain bowed,
bellowed: “All rise for her Majes-
ty, the Queen.”

ANTENNAE WAVING

The workers rose. The Queen
smiled and said: “We shall begin
at once. Let all grievances be
aired, that we may seek methods
and means of bringing harmony
to the peoples of the realm.”

At once the assembly lost its
restraint. The workers, in a rush
of excitement, began furiously
waving their antennae and shriek-
ing for attention. The Queen
boomed:

“It will be necessary for us to
have quiet. Let the workers ad-
dress the chair.”

The workers continued waving
their antennae for attention. The
Queen nodded to one emaciated
little fellow. . “Here, what do you
have to say?” she said, recognizing
him.

The worker stood up. “Your

“Thank you. Is there anybody

fat worker, wearing horn-rimmed
glasses. He was sitting alone in a
corner, smoking a corn silk cigar-

ette. He stood up when the
Queen motioned to him.

“Really, Your Majesty,” he

murmured dully, “there might be
a number of things to do, but I fail
to see where we’re going to do
anything with all this noise. Now

their time. Screaming all at

once, they made it impossible for
the fat worker to continue. “I’m

out.

The meeting at once broke into
battle royal. The workers lined
up on opposite sides of the cham-
ber, were engaged in throwing ink
wells and portfolios at each
other. No one noticed the Queen
when she walked out.

“Yes, Daphne,” she said when
she had reached her chamber and
had taken off her legislative gown.
“Yes, Daphne, the meeting was a

“They’ve all had their voice,”
she said, smiling. “And now, if
you will, bring in that expert.

“Bring him in and we’ll see if we

Years Ago, Was Exact

By Leonard Levison

Prediction, Fourteen

 

 H95
*

Glenn Cunningham ’s jog around at Hanover track l.ast week
reinstated into topical conversation that aged rhetorical ques-
tion, now fast losing its rhetoric, “Is a four—minut.e mile

possible?”
Cunningham surprised even

himself by his time. He bet-

tered his own indoor record by¢
four seconds, which according to
Harry Hillman, the Dartmouth
track coach who arranged the rec-
ord run, is just as it should be.
Hillman had claimed that the
Dartmouth set-up was four sec-
onds faster than any other indoor
track in the world. Cunningham’s

rebuttal removed any skepticism.
>24 9': 31¢

Nurmi’s Mark

But, there is another dramatic
element that should not be disre-
garded. It goes back to 1924 when
the Olympic games were held on
the red clay Stockholm track and
Paavo Nurmi was the Cunningham
of the day.

=l= =14 >l=

During those games, the Phan-
tom Finn paced around the mile
in 41:10.4, creating what at that
time was an amazing wor1d’s rec-
ord. The boys who were credited ‘
with knowing something about
track, made the brazen prediction
that such a mark would stand for
more than twenty years.

=i< * *

And there was no contradiction,
with one exception. Mr. Nurmi,
himself disagreed. “I’m not a nat-
ural miler,” he said, “because I
lack a real speed burst. My mile
record was made possible by plot-
ting out a uniform time schedule
and sticking to an even pace. Ac-
tually this mark is not a good one.
Faster men will beat it repeatedly
when they learn to spread their
effort over the route.”

31¢ >3 *

On The Nose

When asked the stock question
about the four minute mile, Nurmi
made what has turned out to be a
signiﬁcant statement. “While I do
not regard a four minute mile as
beyond human capacity, I think
the most probable record will be‘
4:O4.4”

>l= * #9

Nurmi said this in 1924. Thurs-
day, March 3, 1938, Glenn Cun-
ningham, running in the Dart-
mputh ﬁeld house, burned around
the mile distance in 4204.4.

=l< * >3

The Nurmi words that day four-
teen years ago startled the experts
of the day. Thus, Cunningham
upheld another man’s belief.

3 0 $

There was one track expert’s
prediction that was only half ful-
ﬁlled by Cunningham’s perform-
ance. The expert was Cunning-
ham. A few weeks ago the sturdy

Kansan ventured the prognostica-
tion that some day, someone would
run the mile in 4:04. This wasn’t
as accurate an estimate as Nurmi’s
and it had one other defect. “It
won’t be me,” he said. “San Ro-

mani is. our coming miler. He
might do it.”
='5 =3 *
All of this leaves our “four

minute” question still in the rhet-
oric. In answer, we offer one of
the most scientiﬁc theories yet
promulgated. It was presented by
a gentleman who should know
something about running the mile.
He is Jack Lovelock, the lithely-
built New Zealander, who runs
with an effortless style. Lovelock
held the record for a short time,
after his 4:06.7 time in the Prince-

ton invitational meet. He also
beat Cunningham out in the

Olympic games in Berlin.

=14 v‘.<

V Medical Approach

Retired now to the medical
practice, Dr. Lovelck presents a
medical answer. “The chemical
cycle of fatigue eventually reaches
a point where lactic acid ties up
the runners’ muscles,” states the
doctor-runner, “unless we develop
a man with super-lung capaci.ty,
the human time limit will prob-
ably be around 4:02 for the mile.”

‘vi: $ *

This being the most intellectual
approach thus far, we will end the
discussion with it. One thing to
remember is that to run a four-
minute mile, a runner must aver--
age approximately 15 miles an
hour, covering approximately
seven and one-half yards a second.
And according to the ﬁgures, a
hundred—yard dash man only goes
ten. yards a second.

>x~ =15

5 One Naye

Remember also, that while
Lovelock’s diagnosis is scientiﬁc-
ally sound, there have been other
miscalculations made in the realm
of track that have had as equally
as secure a premise. It is signiﬁ-
cant though, that those closest to
the subject agree. Cunningham,
Nurmi, and Lovelock have ex-
pressed agreement.

:l= =1:

Only A. G. Hill, coach of Eng-
1and’s Sydney Wooderson, who
still holds the record until Cun-
ningham’s is made official, is in
dissent. He thinks his protege can
do four "minutes on the Princeton
track.

impression that the
peruse the athletic columns reg-
ularly. Else, why the lovely full
View picture that invariably
graces his “Goal-lines” column.

However, the cute little brunette
that haunts one of the Commons
Room pillars justiﬁed the sports
editor’s picture. No, of course, she
never read his stuff, but she
thought he looked “‘awful nice.”
Her accomplice admitted that she
used to read sports as a freshman,
but she “caught on” before her
second year at Pitt.

NO TIME

“Caught on to what?” was the
wary query. “Caught on to the
fact that sports were usually on
page three. This girl has devel-
oped the brutal knack of reading
page two, and deftly ﬂipping over
to page four, without being sub-
jected to anything on page three.
She was proud of her accomplish-
ment.

The soft remark of the next girl
was a little more encouraging.
“Sure I read the sport page when
I have time,” she said.—“How-
ever, I never have time.” That
last sentence broke up a budding
friendship.

BLONDE ANSWERS

By this time the assignment
was beginning to sour. But no
consensus of opinion is quite com-
plete without a blonde, and so the
matter was discussed with a very

fairer sex¢

nice number. ,A tradition hang-
ing over from the wild 20’s usually
hits that blondes are often dizzy.
Mindful of this whackiness, the in-
terview started.

This time the approach was dif-
ferent. No blunt questions about
reading sports. Had she gone to
any football games? Oh, yes.
Had she gone to any Pitt games?
Certainly. Did she see basketball
games? Sure. Hockey? Yes.
Baseball? Sometimes. Boxing?
Once in a while. With this ideal
set-up, came the all-important
question, did she read the Pitt
Sport Page?

BLONDES DIZZY

these athletic events, but didn’t
know a football from a basketball.
Her boy friend liked sports so she

By s. s. KALWARY

The local picture of the bas-
ketball season just completing
its turn is not the kind of paint-
ing any ﬂoor tutor would like
to have gracing his office wall.

HIGH~CLASS PLAYERS

Despite a new low in the
court sport for the school on
the Bluff, and less than a .500
percentage for the Blue and Gold
Oaklanders, and just a fair cam-
paign for

the Schenley Park

S c o t c h m e n ,
there were stars
in the Pitts-
burgh league.

If it weren’t
for the high
class players de-
veloped in this
district every
year the game
of basket shoot-
ing would pro-
bably die out,
for the facilities
are poor and the
officiating mis-
erable. The enthusiasm here for
the bucket sport can be attributed
only to the splendid athletes per-
forming on the hardwood for
Pittsburgh’s three collegiate rep-
resentatives, Pitt, Carnegie Tech
and Duquesne.

“Babe” Stark, who played the
leading role on Maxie I-Iannum’s
snappy Tech team, is awarded the
center position. The wiry, cool,
ﬁrst year pivot man was largely
responsible for Carnegie’s better
than usual showing. Stark is a
good ﬁoorman — an aggressive
player, always ﬁghting. “Babe”
almost invariably takes the ball off
of the bank board when a shot is
missed, and, like Pitt’s Zeleznik,

 

- always follows up his shots.

JOHNSON TIRELESS

Pitt’s Captain Bob Johnson is
one of our guard selections. John-
son is a tireless worker on the de-
fense and knows well the tech-
nique of that department of play.
He is a pretty good shot, and
usually connected with one or two
ﬁeld goals in the pinches when
points were needed. Bob is an in-
telligent operator, and a depend-
able passer and dribbler.

The other guard post goes to the
Plaid’s captain, Billy Miller, who
was the most consistent ball hawk
for the Hannum crew . He is with-
out any question the smartest ﬂoor
artist in the city. He knows how
to follow and gain possession of
the leather without weakening his
Miller is a fast,
sure dribbler, and a durable per-
former.

Pitt’s Myles Zeleznik and Du-
; quesne’s Bob O’Malley are our
jﬁrst team forward appointments.

any angle of the. court. He is an
adept feeder, too. “Zilch” is quick
on the start and can travel at»ter-
riﬁc speed with a low dribble that
carries him into the scoring areci,
where he can pass the ball to a
teammate to take a shot, if he is
unable to do so himself. In this
respect he is like Billy Miller.
LONG SHOT
O’Malley, co-captain of the Duke
squad, is one of the neighborhood’s
best long shots. He’s a dangerousl

offensive gun, and, considering that!

he worked with an inferior club,l
possessed an uncanny ability for
checking goal drives. He’s a big
boy, and a typical,.Red and Blue
scrapper. _

Elected to the second team
berths are Spotovich and Garcia,
Pitt;'Combs and Greenberg, Tech,
and Kreiling, Duquesne. The lat-
ter two dribblers were the strong-
est contenders for the front line.
Both Kreiling and Greenberg were
edged oﬁ of the ﬁrst slate for the
same reason; small stature and in-
consistency. F‘

It seems that only the na-

he classiﬁed as suitable opposi-
tion for the undefeated Pitt
swimming team. Friday evening,
in the unfamiliar environs of the
Pittsburgh Athletic Association,
Coach Pat Corr’s swimmers con-
tinued their daily practice routine
of swimming against time.

Of course the Temple Owls were
also in the pool, but as far as op-
position was concerned the Pan-
thers were swimming against time.
Oh yes, there was a score. The
Panthers
Owls’ 11.

Temple was able to get two sec-
onds, and then as the racing lanes
of the PAA tub permitted only
two entries from each school,

in the other events.

It should also be added that they
ﬁnished second in the relay events.
These races, by the way, had a
Saffron-Spanos Cap and Gown
touch. By the time the last man

in his street clothes. That should
offer some idea as to the diﬁerence

between the two teams, even‘

though it is a slight hyperbole.
The brothers Lederstein again
monopolized the ﬁrst place rib-
bons. Milt won the 220—yard
event, and then in a surprise shift,
grabbed the 100-yard sprint, just

touching out Walt Nowatny. Hy— :

mie, substituting for sidelined
Captain Tom Anderson, won the
220—yard breast-stroke, an event
in which he »hadn’t participated
this year.

Other ﬁrst places went to Now-
atny in the 50-yard free—style,
Brown in fancy diving, backstrok-

It’s the same old story!

Kappa Sigma remained the only
undefeated team in the league B
today as a result of their 21-7 tri-
umph over Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

Each team played the game
minus their key man. Johnny
Michelosen, Kappa Sig, watched
the game from the sideline and
Frank Patrick, SAE, failed to put
in an appearance. Both men are
ineligible because of incomplete
grades.

Theta Chi had little difficulty in
trouncing the Sammies, 30 to 9.
The Theta’s are the only team left
to play the Kappa Sigs. Kappa
Sigma defeated them last year for
the Interfraternity league cham-
pionship and this year the Theta’sl
are out to revenge this setback.l
Providing the Theta Chi’s can take
the champs, they will throw the
league into a triple tie, involving]
themselves, Kappa Sigma, and
Sigma Alpha Mu, since little dith-
culty is anticipated in their re-
maining games.

In the third tilt played in League
B, Phi Delta Theta’s ﬁve was too
hot for the Pilams to keep pace.
The Phi Delts won by the decisive
score of 20-5.

Phi Delts protested the Kappa
Si,g’s victory of last Wednesday,
and the game will be replayed at
a later date.

Cleveland Tie Drops Pitt lcers

To League’s Second Position

Following the 3-3 tie
Western Reserve last Thursday
night in Cleveland, the Pitt hockey;
team’s outlook for the O-P league

championship is one of hope and
determination; hope that Du-
quesne will lose one game—just
one game, and determination that
they will cop the rest of theirs.

The Pitt—Redcat tie and Du-
quesne’s corresponding win over
John Carroll, put the Panthers
one point behind the ﬁrst place
Dukes, who have four more games
to play.

Pitt has three more games with
Tech, Fenn, and John Carroll. The
Panthers are fairly sure of taking
the measure of weak Fenn and
Tech, who lack reserves, but the
ﬁnal game of the season with John
Carroll is sure to be a wow-—close
and furious.

McKay was the uncertainty of the ‘

governments regulatory policy
toward business.

Dr. Tippetts advanced, in the
main, the same points as Dr. Mc-
prefaced his
views with the admission that
“there is no way of telling deﬁn-
itely how long the new depression
will last.”

He mentioned that “the banking
situation is far better than in 1931
and ’32,” and that “the govern-
ment’s attitude towards business
seems to be improving and busi-
ness men are slowly beginning to
feel that there will be few if any
additional measures of a wide-
spread reform nature enacted.”
Dr. Tippetts concluded his survey
with the statement that “these
(factors) should all eventually

make an improvement in business
conditions.”

With the use of a chart showing
business activity in the Pittsburgh
district for the past 80 years, Dr.

- Watkins showed that the recession

is, in reality, the second worst de-
pression to hit this district. The
chart revealed that, except for the
second half of 1931, the adjusted
index of business activity never
dropped as low as it has now.
