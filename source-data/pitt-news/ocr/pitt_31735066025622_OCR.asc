The scoreboard at Pitt Stadium lit
up yesterday with the words "The
Future is Today, January 21, 1998."

Moments later, Pennsylvania
Governor Tom Ridge received cheers
and applause as he armounced the
state's intention to grant Pitt $38 million
to construct a new convocation center
and an additional $100 million for carn-
pus improvements.

Among these improvements
include a new multipurpose academic
complex located on the comer of
Forbes Avenue and Bouquet Street

In addition, the grant will pay for
upgrades and renovations to existing
buildings, including a multimillion-
dollar renovation of the Fitzgerald
Field House slated for the spring.

Instead of giving Pitt $38 million
at one time, the state will allot the
University money as the bills come in,
according to Pitt spokesman Ken
Service. The remaining $100 million
will be available in the same manner at
$20 million a year for the next ﬁve
years. »
Pitt has received only $7 million
from the state in the past few years,
Ridge said.

Marshall Goodwin, president of
the Oakland Business and Civic
Association, was unavailable for com-
ment. He has long been critical of Pitt
using tax dollars for improvements
without providing much-needed new

Service said the convocation cen-
ter is expected to cost around $52 mil-
lion, so Pitt will have to come up with
an additional $14 million.

As for the academic center,
Service said, the University will raise
as much money as possible from out-
side sources to build it. Whatever Pitt»
cannot raise will come out of the $100

Clinton denies affairs;
says he keeps no secrets

Across the Nation

WHITE HOUSE — President Clinton
says he hasn’t had a sexual relationship
with a former White House intern who
reportedly has been recorded saying
that there was such a relationship.

Clinton, in an interview with the
PBS program “The News Hour With
Jim Lehrer,” also insists that he never
told anyone to say anything other than
the truth. This is despite reports that the
former intern has said Clinton spoke
with her about covering up the affair.

When asked about a White House
statement today that denied that there
had been any “improper relationship,”
Clinton said this means that “there is
not a sexual relationship, an improper
sexual relationship, or any other
improper relationship.”

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Both the
prosecution and the defense attorneys
agree that Theodore Kaczynski has the
right to represent himself.

In court documents filed today in
Sacramento, Kaczynski’s lawyers
argue that the judge has no grounds to
block him if he wants to represent him-
self.

The judge has indicated that he’s
leaning against allowing Kaczynski to
act as his own lawyer because he failed
to make the request before the jury was
selected. I «

He plans to rule on the issue tomor-
row morning before opening state-
ments are made in the trial.

_ The two sides earlier agreed that
Kaczynski is competent to stand trial
—- despite a psychiatrist’s report ﬁnd-
ing that the accused Unabomber suffers
from paranoid schizophrenia.

WASHINGTON —— America Online
says it should have never revealed the
identity of a sailor who is now facing
expulsion from the Navy'for homosex-
uality.

In a» statement released before a

court hearing today about the case,

AOL says an ‘employee broke company
rules in telling a Navy investigator’ that
Senior Chief Petty Officer Timothy
McVeigh was the author of a “profile
page” describing himself as gay and
interested in young men.

The company adds that the caller
from the Navy violated federal laws
and AOL's established procedures for
requesting information about its mem-
bers — because the investigator didn’t
say he was with the Navy.

McVeigh is fighting the Navy’s
attempts to give him an honorable dis-
charge. His lawyer adds they haven’t
ruled out a suit against AOL.

NEW YORK — Scientists say they may
have found one of the ways the AIDS
virus gets around the body’s immune sys-
tem.

Researchers at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology report in today’s
issue of the journal Nature” that a single
HIV gene called “net” apparently keeps
infected cells from releasing proteins to
alert the immune system.

The test-tube study suggests that if
doctors can ﬁnd drugs to block the gene,
this could help control HIV infections.

Previous studies show the suspected
gene plays a role in AIDS infections.

WILMINGTON, Ohio — A prisoner in
Ohio says his brother was involved in the
bombing of a federal building.

But Cheyne Kehoe is refusing to say
anything more about his brother, Chevie,
and his possible connection to the
Oklahoma City bombing.

Last week, an FBI spokesperson said
the bureau was investigating claims by a
fonner motel manager in Spokane,
Wash., who said Chevie Kehoe may have
known in advance about the Oklahoma
City bombing. The manager said Kehoe
anived before the bombing, asked to
watch CNN and appeared happy when
the blast was reported.

Chevie Kehoe is awaiting trial on I
federal charges in Arkansas, where he and‘

two other men are accused of planning a
revolt against the U.S Government.

He’s'also charged with taking part in
a shootout with police in Ohio which was
captured by a police,car’s video camera.
His brother has been convicted in the
same shootout.

HARRISBURG, Pa. — The House
Education Committee endorsed a bill yes-
terday to require all Pennsylvania teach-
ers take professional—development cours-
es every five, years to maintain their certi-
ﬁcation.

The bill, which the panel endorsed 23
to 2, now moves to the House
Appropriations Committee.

Should the bill become a law,‘ all
state-certiﬁed educators of primary— and
seconda1y—school children would have to
complete 180 hours of professional-
development courses or academic cours-
es approved by the state before their
teaching certiﬁcates could be renewed.

The state would pick up the tab, and
teachers who fail to comply would not get
their certiﬁcates renewed. I

The bill, sponsored by Committee
Chairman Jess Stairs, a Republican from
Westrnoreland, would link current school
district programs for professional devel-
opment with state money to help teachers
meet the new continuing—education
requirements.

$100 million granted for

campus improvements

Elaine Clifford

For The Pitt News

Pitt scientists will no longer
need to perform their cutting-
edge research in some of the old-
est buildings on campus.

To fund a proposed $32 mil-
lion science building, Pitt says it
will raise money from private
sources then dip into the $100
million the state granted for cam-
pus renovations.

Governor Ridge yesterday
armounced $138 million in fund-
ing from the state to be used in
projects on Pitt's campus. A new
convocation center will take $38
million from that amount and the
rest will go to changes in existing
buildings. _

Pitt can’t say when the new
building will be constructed. a -

"There aren't even blueprints
at this point. All we have is com-
puter imagery," said Pitt
Spokesman Ken Service.

The academic complex plans
include a proposed location at the
southwest comer of Forbes

Avenue and Bouquet. Street,
across the street from Miami
Subs and The Bee—hive.

Some of the buildings cur-
rently located on that University-
owned land include: the Pitt
Police Department rninistation,

the University Volunteer Center, .

and The Pit Theatre, known
locally for its Friday Night
Improvs, a weekend comedy
show. These buildings must
come down to make way for the
project.

Science department ofﬁces,
classrooms and retail space will
fill the academic complex. Most
of the science departments —
biological sciences, chemistry,
physics, neuroscience and psy-
chology —— will move in, along
with a new College of Business
Administration.

Many of those departments
are currently housed in Thaw,
Old Engineering and Allen

halls— three of the oldest build-w

ings on campus.
Service said that moving

for the remaining ones and allow
them to operate more efficiently.

The $100 million won’t
come in a lump sum; the state
will give Pitt $20 million incre-
ments every year for the next ﬁve
years.

Pitt said it will make various
improvements around campus

- with the money it doesn’t use for

the science building.
The most extensive of these
renovations will be the expansion

of the Fitzgerald Field Houseand
Trees Hall. Changes in the
Cathedral of Learning include
improvements to the elevators,
the ﬁre-suppression system and
the installation of air conditioning
throughout the building, accord-
ing to Pitt. ' _
Service said that money
would also go into modernization
of classrooms all over campus.

"We’re in the process of cre-
ating additional funding for dorm

Office ‘ of Residence Life, who
review and solve residence

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge
emphasized that the new convocation cen-
ter was an educational, job—producing pro-
]eCt. _

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg spoke of
the University's growth in the Oakland
community and on its regional campuses.

Men’s basketball Head Coach Ralph
Willard saw nothing but unbridled potential
for recruiting and the chance to change the
whole image of the University.

Yesterday's armouncement that the
University of Pittsburgh secured $38 mil-
lion in state ftmding began the long—awaited
process of building the convocation center.

Most 'of the attention the center has
received revolves around the Athletics
Department's potential uses of it, but the Pitt
Program Council has some suggestions,
too.

"The center will deﬁnitely give us a
venue, something that the campus has
lacked for four_ years," said the PPC's
Lisabeth Dixon. "This facility will give this
campus unity. It opens the door to a range of
possibilities and it gives the students a rea-
son to stay on campus and to congregate
somewhere. It deﬁnitely develops our Pitt
pride."

"The convocation center will provide
more opporttmities in the evenings as a con-

"And it will keep people out of the bars!"
Although Collins
will graduate before

is a reality, he said he
believes the facility
will help the caliber of
recruiting.

"It will help the
younger athletes, and

letes here, so there will
be better recruiting
beneﬁts, deﬁnitely,"
said Collins._ "It will
broaden our whole
aspect as a big-time
athletics school."

PPC Director Tom Misuraca,, speculat-
ed about several ideas for PPC events. But
he couldn't give speciﬁc details yet because
of contract stipulations with the Athletics
Department andthe fact that no dates are set
for construction.

"It depends on what we the Program A

Council are allowed to do," Misuraca said.
"If any events are to be held through the Pitt
Program Council, such as a concert, we_
have to go through the agreement. We ‘don't
know if that agreement still holds, and we
haven't discussed it yet with the new athlet-

‘ic administration.

He Said

"The athletic department has been facility-
poor, and it is amazing
that they have done so
"much. with what they
have."

Misuraca was a
member of the original
committee that spoke
to event promoters and
other stadium autl1ori—
ties and contractors
regarding features
needed to make the
convocation center a
success.

Misuraca wasn't
at the official press
conference that
unveiled the University's plans for the new
convocation center, but he realizes that the
facility will primarily be used for athletic
events — "What it should be used for," he
stated. - _ -

" e would love to schedule some of

our events in. the convocation center," ‘

Misuraca said. "There are no dates for
events yet and you can't make any booking
plans without an opening target date, but the
ideal opening event would be to open the
facility with a concert."

Dixon added that other schools such as
Cleveland State and Penn State opened

concerts. But using the new facility for
events such as concerts and expositions
would also mean making the necessary
technological adjustments to the building.
"There are a large number of things that

. can be done in this facility, from concerts to

circuses. Whatever is imaginable can be
allowed and it will.be beneﬁcial to the Pitt
population. But in order to make the convo-

~ cation center a multipurpose facility, not

only are the basics needed, but reinforcing
features are needed, such as dressing-room
facilities, extra loading docks, even posi-
tions up high and at a good stage angle for
spotlights." ~

No one can speculate whether those
features will be built, but Misuraca visual-
ized the center as a rallying point for the
campus. He compared the opening of the
future facility to the opening of Jacobs Field

in Cleveland or Oriole Park at Camden '

Yards in Baltimore.

"You can't buy a seat in Jacobs Field.
They're sold out for the entire ' season.
Hopefully that will happen here at Pitt."

Misuraca also considered the impact of
buildingthe convocation center on admis-
sions recruiting. '

"It will attractstudents. It's not just a -
letes who will come to this school, but the
average Joe and Jane student will want to
come to Pitt With the athletic program on

the rise, it makes everyone excited" _ ~ f

million from the state.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said he
doesn't think Pitt will have trouble raising
enough money.

"The excitement we saw today, I'm
conﬁdent, will provide the excitement we
need to get funding from the people," he
said.

One priority the funding wiH not
address is Pitt's need for additional housing.

Nordenberg said the commonwealth
capital fund, which is the fund providing the
money, does not contribute moneyfor hous-
mg.

He added that any housing money
would have to come from other sources.

Service said housing cannot be covered
by state money because it is an auxiliary
enterprise of the University. It brings in its

FROM PAGE 1

own money, so Pennsylvania won’t provide
funding for changes.

He said the University will be simulta-
neously moving ahead on three fronts,
namely academic, athletic and housing.

"It [housing] was kind of left out
today," Service said. "But, it's deﬁnitely a
priority." . ’

Service said the convocation center is

' only in the planning stage and will likely

take ﬁve years to complete.

It will be only the second major athlet-

ics irnprovement to the campus since Trees
Hall was built in 1963. Since then, Pitt's
Athletics Department has doubled and the
University's enrollment has increased by
10,000.

The center will be located behind Pitt
Stadium, connected to both the stadium and

the Fitzgerald Field
House with Allequippa~
Street tunneled under it.

Pitt said the facility
will have a seating capac-
ity of around 12,500 and
will provide new oﬂices,
a practice gym, exercise
rooms and the home
court for both the men's
and women's basketball
teams.
The multimillion-
dollar renovation of the
Field House begins this
spring, and when com— ‘
plete, the building will house volleyball,
wrestling, gynmastics, and track activities
and competitions.

Only the swimming team will remain
in Trees Hall after these sports move out.

Nordenberg said

academic center, Pitt is
expected to create 200
University jobs.

Steve Pederson,

said: Pitt will soon take
bids for names for the
center. He. said the center
will likely be named
after a company that
pays for the right.

During his
speech, Ridge said Pitt
has great personal signiﬁcance to his family.
His brother is a Pitt law school graduate, and
his wife earned her master's degree in
library science here.

He went on to say he was excited about
the new leadership that Nordenberg brought
to Pitt. V

"By helping Pitt achieve," Ridge said.
"We help Pennsylvania achieve."

Later, Pitt's SGB President Alyson
Wallach, and the captain of the men's bas-
ketball team, Vonteego Cummings,
addressed the crowd.

Wallach said it's a "truly great day" for
the student body. She thanked Ridge and
said he will be remembered forapproving
the key funding to build the convocation
center. -

Cummings presented Ridge with a Pitt

‘basketball jersey with Ridge's name onthe

back and the number "1." ,

Loud applause erupted when Ridge
held the jersey up and the Pitt band broke
out into "Hail to Pitt."

Wallach later said the SGB had nothing
to do with getting the money from the state.
Nordenberg did it all, she added.

But, she said, she hopes to get more stu-
dents involved in the future of the convoca-
tion center.

"We hope the students will be involved «

in the planning of the many facilities that are
about to surface," Wallach said.’
Nordenberg said Pitt has grown from a

log-cabin academy, built on the edge of the

American ﬁontier, to an internationally rec-
ognized University. '
"By looking on to our potential, we
have helped produce literally hundreds. of
thousands of thousands of happier lives," he
said "Taken individually, each of these tri-

umphs is heartwarming. Collectively, they '
. are the hallmark of a great university."

"And the University of Pittsburgh is a
great University," he added.

Moving on to more
pressing matters 

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg,

Congratulations.

You seem to have pulled off a miracle, getting
Governor Tom Ridge to release Pitt from your prede-
cessor’s 1993 mistake.

When Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor signed a
deal with then-Govemor Bob Casey five years ago, he
substantially impeded progress on our convocation
center.

O’Connor accepted a $13 million pledge of sup-
port from the state, provided the money was made
available immediately, instead of the $30 million that
we knew we needed. Supposedly, he wanted to get the
project moving.

But there’s such a thing as critical mass when it
comes to money, and $13 million didn’t start any‘
chain reactions. Instead, we lost ﬁve years on the pro-
ject. . ,

So, Mark Nordenberg, Pitt owes you a big round
of applause for convincing Ridge to tear up an agree-
ment that neither you nor he signed. Well done.

But now we’d like to ask you to focus on some-
thing else: residence halls. ' ' -

We don’t want to sound like a broken record, but
Pitt students really need a new dormitory. We could
use a few, in fact.

Enrolhnent numbers took a huge leap this year,
and your administration is working on efforts to

' improve undergraduate retention.

If those efforts work, and if the convocation center
makes Pitt even more appealing to potential students,
overcrowding will become such a problem that knock-
ing down a few walls and putting in extra bunk beds
just won’t be enough to compensate.

Speaking of critical mass, the number of students
in residence at Pitt has already reached that point. It

seems to be in deﬁance of the laws of physics that '

nothing has exploded yet.

So think about it: Do you really want proud par-
ents and campus visitors attending basketball games in
the new convocation center to walk outside and see
dilapidated dorm buildings with their kids pressed up
against the windows?

. Probably not. So let the engineers and the athletics
directors worry about the convocation center from
herle on out, and ﬁndwyour basketball fans someplace
to 1ve. .

Please do not mistake
today’s advertising insert enti-
tled “She’s A Child, Not A

When this same supple-
ment appeared last year, we
received many phone calls and
visits from angry readers
protesting that The Pitt News
ran such a thing.

. You’ll notice that the insert
is labelled in the upper left-
hand comer as an “advertising
supplement.” The’ Human Life
Alliance of Minnesota

Education Fund Inc. bought a

paid advertisement from us —
an option that is open to any
person, organization or private
company that is willing to pay.

Had we received a pro-
choice supplement in lieu of or
in addition to a pro—life ad, we
would have accepted that as
well. .

In order to provide a free
student newspaper, The Pitt

tisements. They are the—curren-
cy with which the paper is
printed. ‘

The Human Life alliance is
not connected with The Pitt

I’m amazed.

In all this academic year,
only two people have written
about abortion for The Pitt
News. Both of their columns
are on the next page. '

I expected a ﬂood of writ-
ers and letters to the editor
about this most common
debate topic. It’s good to see
that I was wrong. Too much
would get awfully boring
awfully fast, except to the few
who send letter after letter of
counterarguments;

Last year’s opinions edi-
tor actually had to call a

. moratorium on the subject. It

was filling far too many pages
of this newspaper.

to you all at once

Here are the only columns
I intend to print on abortion
this school year. Unless some
amazing developments make
the subject newsworthy again,
I tend to believe today’s 25th
anniversary of the Supreme
Court’s decision on, Roe vs.
Wade will be the only occa-
sion to warrant the discussion.
' Hopefully, readers will
find the arguments here to be
somewhat different
those we all know already and
find all too familiar.‘They’re
not the typical “It’s morally
wrong vs. It’s a woman’s
choice” debate that probably
everybody cangive both sides
of in his sleep. 3
Instead, the pro—life argu-
ment centers around what has

The action which shows com-
passion for a human being

Abortion has always been
a sensitive issue. Hopefully,
this point/counterpoint will
inspire people to consider the
topic in different ways than
they have before. We don’t
expect to change any minds,
but we do hope to make them

POINT/COUNTERPOINT

New medical techniques make
abortion seem like no big deal

Carrie Hagar

Columnlst

New medical techniques have made
abortions easier and faster than ever

before.

Tl1ey’re allowing much earlier abor-
tions, giving mothers less time to think
about their actions.

By blurring the lines between abor-
tion and contraception, science has made
the process seem more removed, less
personal than it should be.

One new technique uses a hand—held
syringe to end the pregnancy rather than
using the traditional vacuum pump.
Doctors call these “medical” abortions
instead of “surgical” ones, making it
sound like a routine medical procedure

If women can lead themselves to
believe an abortion is just a routine med-
ical procedure, they might convince
themselves more easily to have one than
they otherwise would.

Of course, whether an abortion is
called “medical” or “surgical” doesn’t

  

medical affairs at the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America, said,
“For most women, the sooner they know

they’re pregnant and the sooner they '

decide what they’re going to do, the bet-
ter. With these very early abortions,
we’re talking about a
whole gestational sac
that’s the size of a
match stick head. It’s
nobody’s .picture of a
little baby sucking its
thum .” .

Basically, he is
saying that since the
baby is only the size of
a match stick head, to
hell with it. That is
such an inhumane
thing for a doctor to say. Doctors are sup-
posed to save lives, not think of better
ways to end them.

It gives women a distorted view of
what is really happening. If a doctor tells
a women her baby (actually doctors
don’t use the term “baby;” they prefer
the less personal term “embryo”) is only
the size of a rrratch stick head, she’ll feel

less compelled to think twice about end- '

ing its life.

   

 

Laura Echevarria, director of media
relations for the National Right to Life
Committee, said, “Scientiﬁcally speak-
ing, there’s no difference between a fer-
tilized egg and what you have three
weeks later. Saying it’s okay to kill it in
the early stages because you’re more
comfortable with that is completely arbi-
trary.”

Just because these early abortions
are more convenient doesn’t mean they
are morally or ethically right. It shouldn’t
be convenient to end the life of an
unborn child. ,

So-called “moming after pills” just
became widely available last year when
the FDA armounced they are a safe and
effective way to end a pregnancy (that is,
safe for the woman, not the child).

These pills, which are extremely
high—dose birth control pills, can be
taken up to 72 hours after unprotected
sex, ending any pregnancy that had start-

' ed.

In some states, through arrange-
ments with doctors, pharmacists can dis-

, .p ogres:

made in the ‘fl’ against abortro The
proportion of Americans who believe
abortion is acceptable in all ‘cases is
slowly declining, perhaps because peo-
ple are ﬁnally realizing that abortion is
murder. Last year, 16 states passed legis-
lation banning partial-
birth abortions, which
end the life of a baby
in the third trimester
by pulling it out by its
feet up to its neck,

     

brain, and crushing its
skull. It’s hard to
believe that this proce-
dure is still available
in more than half the
country.

The ﬁght against abortion is far from
over. In the 25 years since Roe vs. Wade,
countless lives of unborn children have
been lost. We can’t make up for the
atrocities of the past, but we can try to
make a brighter future.

Carrie Hager doesn’t believe women
who say abortion is easier than adop-
tion. "Giving a better life is much easier
than ending a life. -

Life without love can be

worse than no life at all .

then suctioning out its _

Manara

“Abortion is not, and should never
be, a crime. Bombing abortion clinics,
however, is terrorism.” ‘

I once passed a sign that said this,
and I remember staring at it for awhile. I
thought about how
dimcult the decision
must be for the
woman who needs
an abortion. I tried to
picture what it felt
like to be a woman
who‘ knows that
physically, ﬁnancial-
ly or psychological-
ly, she is unable to
carry a baby to tenn.
I imagined her_ con-
cern, her anguish,
her thousands of rea-
sons, her ﬁnal decision. . a "

Then I realized that this intensely "

personal decision is not left to the

      
 

"'neigIr' r’s"down th'e‘bI' ‘k.

Prior to Roe vs. Wade, the perils a
woman would encounter trying to get an
abortion were heart wrenching. Women
who couldn’t give birth to their children,
for whatever reason, were forced to
spend days, weeks, even months search-
ing for someone to help them.

Sometimes they were lucky and
received the illegal abortion from a doc-
tor. But that was rare. Most ‘were per-
formed by people who had nevertbeen to
medical school, didn’t sterilize any
materials, had the women blindfolded"
and misled so that they couldn’t be
traced if anything happened to the
women. The ﬁlthy conditions, deeply
affected women’s psyches, and they
affected their families’, too. When she
got a horriﬁc infection from the dirty
catheters, rusty knives and instruments,
it would destroy her and all her loved.
ones.

Most of the women had husbands
and children at home. Today, about half
of the women who undergo this proce-
dure have at least one child already.
They have abortions to save their tiring

bodies, to prevent even harsher poverty, ',

to stop suﬂering before it occurs.

She said

    

The illegal abortions killed thou-

sands of women, leaving children moth-

erless, husbands widowed. Hundreds of
children were put up for adoption, ripped
from the only families they knew,

because the single fathers couldn’t take,

care of the four, ﬁve, six children left at
home. And, prior to the 1970s, women
I weren’t allowed to get
birth control if they
weren’t married, and
even if they were wed,
they. needed their hus-
bands’ written consent.
They were, by law,
forced to have children
without help to prevent
the pregnancy. Women
couldn’t talk to their
husbands or doctors or
friends, because abor-
tion and sex were taboo.
. . In the end, because of
the silence, women died.

Today, in a world of more than ﬁve
billion people and steadily growing, with

criminals were born of unwanted preg-
nancies. As sad as it is for the women
who have to go through unwanted preg-
nancies, it’s even sadder for the children.

Going through life without love,
being abused, neglected, abandoned, is
not fair. It is not even fathomable to me
how somebelieve that we should protect
life at any cost. The quality of life is
somehow forgotten, when it ought to be
the main concern. What ‘should be an
issue now is how we alleviate the ‘suffer-

‘ing, instead of trying to force it to con-

tinue. .

As proven 25 years ago, a safe, legal
abortion is a woman’s constitutional
right. It’s not something that needs to be
begged -or pleaded for. Abortions have
been performed on every type of
woman, on doctors, on lawyers, on the
strongly religious. (In 1955, almost one
in four American women had an illegal
abortion by the time she was 45.)

' It is not a question of judgment. It is
a question of compassion.

Jessica Manara believes its not our
right to subject children to unwanted
lives. V '

senseless. The assertion that we can
recruit requires the assumption that het-
erosexuals are so insecure in theirown
sexuality that they can be changed. That
simply doesn’t make sense. The common
tactic of citing any effort to teach toler-
ance to children as a conversion of them
_is also baseless. Are we to believe that

heterosexuals are
bound to become gay?
_ Paul Clark also
demonstrated‘ an igno-
rance of the basic foun-

namely the U.S.

Amendment assures all
citizens that they

' should never have to choose to live in

a common religious belief. No one has to “

choose between being gay or being reli-
gious, anyway. This is just the common
assumption of the narrow-minded who
use their personal faithas justiﬁcation for
prejudice.

Clark also uses the tired oxymoronic
phrase “special rights.” When a law is
designed to encompass all sexual orienta-
tions, it is not a special privilege, and
regardless of whether or.not health care is
a right, being treated equally is. A person
does not waive his fundamental rights by
falling in love.

I was also disappointed in the article
offered by James Maude. I would have
hoped that a condemnation of homopho-
bia would have consisted of more than

parodies of demagogues in between.

Mayc maced:
Wizard Webber
faces charges

As many players around the NBA
have ﬁgured out over thepast ﬁve years, it
takes a lot to stop Washington Wizards
forward Chris Webber.

Looks like the Prince George’s
County Police Department has found the
perfect defense: pepper spray, a.k.a. Mace.

That’s what it took to subdue the 24-
year—old Mayce Edward Christopher
Webber 11 after he was stopped for speed-
ing Tuesday around 9:30 a.m.

Painful irony, huh?

Webber was on his way to a 10:00
a.m. practice at the MCI Center, located in
downtown Washington, and was reported-
ly going 70 mph in a 50 mph zone.

It was a routine tralﬁc stop that quick-
ly turned the day of an NBA superstar
upside down.

It didn’t do too much for the already
tarnished image of his team, either.

Webber was cited for nine misde-
meanors, including assault, resisting
arrest, possession of marijuana, driving
under the inﬂuence of marijuana, and ﬁve
other trafﬁc—re1ated offenses.

The police said that Webber didn’t
have a driver’s license or registration for
his 1998 Ford Expedition and that his only
form of identiﬁcation was a credit card.

When the former Michigan star failed
to cooperate with police, he allegedly
assaulted them and they responded with
pepper spray.

Webber was handcuﬂ"ed and taken to
the Prince George’s District III Police
Station.

The vehicle was impounded and
searched.

The police found the remains of a

‘marijuana cigarette in the ashtray as well

as traces of marijuana leaves, ashes, stems
and seeds in the rear of the vehicle, behin
the passenger seat. _ '

Officials also said that the Ford
Expedition was equipped with customized
“hidden” compartments and a mechanism
that can. be used to obscure its license
plate. '

Although there were no traces of alco-
hol in Webber’s system, a drug recogni-
tion expert determined that Webber was,
in fact, under the inﬂuence of drugs other
than alcohol based on his pupil movement.

Webber will likely be tried in a district
court some time this spring, with the
biggest obstacle being the second-degree
assault charge which carries a maximum
penalty of 10 years in prison and a $2,500
ﬁne. -

That the Green Bay Packers are in the
Super Bowl again this year is no surprise.
In fact, to some people, the only smprise
would be if they were to lose. Way back in
the preseason, there was speculation that

Of course, the Packers can run the ball,
too, this ‘year, which makes them even
more dangerous than in the past. Ironically,
it took an injury to last year’s leading rush-
er, Edgar Bennett, to bring this year’s star
into the spotlight.

Dorsey Levens had always been on
the ‘ﬁeld as a blocker or pass catcher. This
year, he proved that he can be a runner.
Levens ran for 1,435 yards this season,

also committed. '

Demetrious Rich has given Pitt a ver-
bal commitment, and has already played
at Pitt Stadium. Rich played at
Wilmington High School, which played
South Park in the Class AA championship
at Pitt. Rich was a second team all—state
selection in the small—school division.

“[Rich] has blazing speed and quick-
ness. He’s really just learning the game
because he has played it only two years.
He’s just getting his conﬁdence,”
\V1lmington Coach Head Terry Verrelli
said.

Pitt also landed one of West
Allegheny High School’s two star
recruits. Standout Ben Herbert made a
verbal agreement with VV1sconsin. Pitt,
however, made one with Brandon Dewey.

“I just felt really good down there at
Pitt when I visited,” Dewey said. “I like
how close [Pitt is] to home and how my V
family can come see me play,” Dewey
offered. Dewey was a third—team all—state
selection at defensive end.

Pitt strengthened its ties to its neigh-
bor by receiving verbal agreements from
two defensive backs from Ohio, both of
whom can list “defensive player of the
year” on their resumes. _

its begin. Pitt holds six separate visits, also
called recruiting weekends, of which three
are held in December and three in January.
Players are limited to ﬁve ofﬁcial visits to
Division—I colleges; those ﬁve visits can be
broken down to one visit to ﬁve different
colleges, ﬁve visits to a particular university,
three visits to one college and two visits to
another, and so forth.

Although Cignetti says that more than
three—fourths of this year’s recruiting class
have already committed to Pitt, every year
there are the isolated few who are still unde-
cided about their football future. A

“Ninety-nine percent of the prospects
have made their decision a week before the
signing date,” Cignetti said. “Very few
make their decision way before or a week
beyond the deadline. Ifa recruit hasn’t made

 

up his mind and the signing date is coming
up, it’s our job to reinforce the positives of
our school and our program. We have to
look for that key that unlocks the proverbial
door.”

As stated before, recruiting is not mere-
ly about getting a 17-year-old to sign a piece
of paper. Commitment is emphasized and
reiterated to every recruit who goes through
the recruiting process, and familiarity with
the program is the key to picking up a hot
recruit. .

“I liked Pitt because I was familiar with is

the program,” said Kopp, who was also
recruited by Notre Dame and Northwestern.
“I didn’t want to go to a Penn State or a
Notre Dame because I didn’t like the high-
and—rnighty attitude that those schools had,
looking down on other programs. Pitt was
moving up, and I liked that aspect of the 
gram”

Willard said. “It will change the whole
perception of the University of
Pittsburgh. It will not only be a tremen-
dous boost to our program, but all other
programs as well.”

Willard’s diplomacy notwithstand-
ing, the primary beneficiaries of the
project will undoubtedly be the men’s
and women’s basketball. teams, who
have a new prize to offer potential
recruits.

“So many schools have put up new
buildings,” Willard said. “It will be a
tremendous shot in the arm recruiting-
wise. No longer will we lose these kids
because of the facility. This is going to
eliminate that.”

Willard has felt such a lack through
all of his recruiting campaigns. Before,
he could only offer promises with little
backing. Now, he can provide details to
anyone who will listen: ‘$38 million
from the state. A proposed site behind
Pitt Stadium. A new agreement between
the commonwealth and the University
that provides for capital-fund increases,
among other funding measures. A
promise with teeth.

As Pitt Athletics Director Steve
Pederson said, “It will become less of a
vision and more of a reality.”

Cummings was ﬂoated one of the

THE PITT NEWS

former promises while being recruited
by Willard, but notes that he chose Pitt
not for the stadium, “but for everything
else.”

“I think they’ll get better players
with the new facilities,” Cummings
said.

The Cost Center, which houses ten-
nis courts and an artificial turf practice
field, was the last recreation-based_
structure built at the University. The
older athletics—based structures, includ-
ing Trees Hall and the Fitzgerald Field
House, will undergo renovations as the
convocation center is built. .

Wil1ard’s old home, which is also
the home for the gymnastics, wrestling,
volleyball, and indoor track and
women’s basketball teams will no
longer house both basketball squads.

The other squad in question, Kirk
Bruce’s women’s basketball team, was
not represented at the conference,
because it was en route to Wednesday’s
game at Boston College.

And aside from Cumrrtings, the
men’s team was barely represented.
Willard sat surrounded by writers,
Athletics Department officials and
Panther fans.

For the first time in years, he was '

out of the convocation—center spotlight.

And happy about it.

“It’s fantastic,” said the coach. “I
can’t wait to get things started.”

The possession-of—marijuana charge
carries a maximum penalty of one year in
prison and a $1,000 fine.

This arrest marks the third time in 14
months that a member of the VVizards has
run into trouble with the law.
Unfortunately for the Wizards, these hap-
pen to be their three top players.

In November 1996, Webber’s former
teammate at Michigan, Juwan Howard,
was arrested and charged with driving
while intoxicated. Howard agreed to enter
a rehabilitation program in exchange for
the charge being dropped.

Point guard Rod Strickland ‘was

FROM PAGE 12

charged with driving under the inﬂuence -

and disorderly conduct in September after
making anillegal U-tum.

After all this, one would think that
Webber would be in serious trouble with
the NBA as well as the Prince George’s
police, but lucky for him, his employers
are cool about the pot, man.

The NBA could make an All—Star
team out of the superstars who have failed
to balance their stardom with responsibili-
ty over the ‘past few years. -

Philadelphia 76ers guard Allen
Iverson was charged with a weapons vio-
lation and possession of marijuana last
August and faces two years of drug test-
mg.

Thursay, 22 January 1998 1

Iverson sat out one game. .

Portland Trail Blazers forward Isaiah
Rider was charged with an illegal cellular
phone in California and possession of mar-
ijuana in Oregon.

Rider was forced to miss two games.

Oh, by the way, the NBA doesn’t list
marijuana on its list of controlled» sub-
stances, which includesonly cocaine and

- heroin.

The United States of America does,
but the NBA does not.

. Move over Bill Clinton — David
Stern calls the shots when it comes to guys
who can put a ball in a basket.

Sounds fair to me.

Before this setback, Webberhad been
having a career season so far. '

He led the then Bullets to their ﬁrst
playoff appearance in nine years; he was
selected as a member of Dream Team IV,
which will play in the World
Championships this summer in Greece;
and he is the tearn’s top scorer and
rebounder and has scored 20 or more
points in the Wizards’ last 12 games.

Webber will likely face tough crowds
and media scrutiny until the next young
star does something stupid. The only thing
