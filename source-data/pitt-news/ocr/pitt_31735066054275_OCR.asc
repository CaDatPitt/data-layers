In addition to creating a more fun and
livable campus for students (see Part 2 of
Quality of Life series), the provost’s ofﬁce
Wants to help undergraduates succeed acad-
emically here at Pitt. '

For students who tremble at the thought
of sitting through biology, physics and
chemistry courses, the Learning Skills
Center may have a solution. The
Supplemental Instruction program will pro-
vide tutorial assistance to students in courses
that traditionally have high failure rates.

Approximately $175,000 from the
provost quality of life funds will be allocated
for programs like SI and the LSC computer
labs, as well as for development of disability
services, according to the provost’s report.

The success of SI can clearly be seen
statistically as well as by student response.

Jessica Staniszewski, a Pitt junior, took
organic chemistry during the spring term last
year.
, "The S1 sessions were very helpful. It’s

rom provost

good to hear material reiterated by someone
else. You get a dilferent angle,” Staniszewski
said -
The instructors for SI are all undergrad-
uates who have taken the course before and
who must apply for the position of SI leader.
Each leader undergoes a t:raining program
for the course they are teaching. The pro-
gram trains undergraduates because S1 is a
peer helping program

This fall, between seven and eight SI
leaders will be teaching recitations in select
science courses. Business calculus, a new
course recently added to the program, will
also have an S1 leader.

The LSC already olfers services for
reading, math and study skills. Also avail-
able for students are individual and small
group sessions for time management, test-
taking techniques and lecture note taking.

The Disability Resources and Services
office receives $50,000 of the $175,000 allo-
cated. Marcie Roberts, the coordinator for
the services, says the money will be used
mostly for a learning disability specialist.

Eﬂ°ective Jan. 1, 1997, the Graduate
School of Public and Intemational Affairs
will have -a new dean, leaving only six more
positions to be ﬁlled at the top of Pitt’s adrnin-
istration.

Carolyn Ban, who was selected for the
position last week, will be replacing Martin
Staniland, whohasbeenservingasinterim
dean of GSPIA since March 1995.

Ban is currently a professor in the
Department of Public Administration in the
Graduate School of Public Affairs at the State
University of New York at Albany. .

Ban was one of four candidates selected
by the search committee, headed by Morton
Coleman. Making the ﬁnal decision, Provost
James V. Maher chose Ban for professional
and scholarly reasons.

“Looking at her past successes, I think
we have a good clean. She will do we ,” said
Coleman.

In his announcement, Maher cited Ban’s
research accomplishments and adrninistra-

 

GSPIA dean is latest replacement

tive experience as the reason for her appoint-
ment. ,

Maher said that GSPIA was a profes-
sional school with a signiﬁcant impact on the
University, and that Ban’s very good back-
ground and scholarly activity made her the
best choice. .

“Throughout her professional career,
Ban has produced a steady stream of excep-
tional scholarship focusing on human
resource management and administrative
reform,” Maher said. “She also has adminis-
trative experience in both academic and gov-
ernrnent settings. I ﬁrmly believe that Dr. Ban
is ideally qualiﬁed to lead the development of
the University’s Graduate School of Public
and International alfairs, and I look forward
to working with her as she builds upon
GSPIA’s past successes.”

A graduate of Smith College, Ban

received her master’s degree from Harvard 1

University in regional studies of the Soviet
Union, and her Ph.D in political science ﬁorn
Stanford University.

She had been on the faculty of SUNY at

Faculty Assembly discusses
10-year construction plan

Marc Nuzzo

   

The Faculty Assembly met Tuesday
afternoon to discuss the University Budget
and Planning Committee’s armual report
known as the Capital Planning Document

Throughout the discussion, University
Senate President Keith McDufﬁe men-
tioned the need for the Senate to have input
on the report. He asked the Faculty
Assembly committees to have their input
back to him by Sept 23.

“One of the biggest challenges facing
the assembly is maintaining a share of gov-
ernance,” said McDuﬂie. He also added
that the provost and the chancellor were
supportive of the faculty having a say in the
governance of the University. V

Pitt hopes to utilize a large portion of
its current real estate more eﬁectively
before expanding any further. The Capital
Planning Document, a 10 year plan intro-
duced to the assembly by Robert Pack, vice
provost of _ academic planning and

 

resources management, focuses on several
major undertakings. The plan is designed to
assess the ﬁnancial needs of the University
and meet them.

“Though the details of the [Capital
Planning Document] may change, the
emphasis will remain the same,” said
McDuﬁ"1e.

One of the main parts of the document
calls for $361 million of University funds
to be budgeted for the renovation, preser-
vation and construction of facilities.

“Most interesting, I think, is the prima-
ry investment in student oriented facilities,”
Pack said. “It is the view of the committee
that we’ve allowed buildings most used by
our students simply to deteriorate. We can
donothinglessthanthisifwearetoremain
competitive with those institutions whose
competitors we are.”

Another concept introduced at the
assembly, the Capital Planning Report, will

. provide for the construction of a multi—pur-

pose academic complex along Forbes

U.S. launches second attack
against Saddam Hussein

Around The World

WASHINGTON —- The United States
launched a second attack against Saddam
Hussein’s southern air defenses just hours
after President Clinton vowed he would
“make Saddam pay a price” for sending
troops into the Kurdish enclave in northern

The United States ﬁred the new salvo
less than a day after the administration used
27 cruise missiles against Iraqi military tar-
gets. Oﬂicials described the second strike as
designed both to complete the earlier nris—
sions and to underscore the message to
Hussein that he must end his military moves.

In other moves to punish the Iraqi
leader, Clinton ordered a 60-mile extension
of the area of southern Iraq where the United
States and its allies had forbidden the use of
Iraqi aircraft after the 1991 war. The zone
now stretches from the Kuwaiti border north
to the outskirts of Baghdad. Administration
oﬂicials said the agreement to let Iraq export
oil to raise currency for food and medical
supplies was now “frozen.” The New York
Times

MOSCOW — In the grimmest assessment
to date of the toll in Chechnya, Aleksandr
Lebed said today that about 80,000 people
had been killed in the ﬁghting and that some
240,000 had been wounded.

The estimates by President Boris
Yeltsin’s security adviser far exceed many
casualty projections, which held that 30,000
to 40,000 people have been killed in 21
months of war. But some human rights orga-
nizations said I.ebed’s ﬁgures are more up to
date. 4

Since Lebed signed an accord with
Chechen military commanders, his task has
been further complicated by Kremlin
inﬁghting. Lebed has been chided by
Kremlin rivals, who have complained that
the accord makes too many concessions to
Chechen rebels. Yeltsin has yet to endorse
the agreement. The New York Times

UPMC experiments may yield breakthrough in stroke treatment

_isa Grzyboski

.-I
-‘-... .

   

In previous years, the only option
available for stroke patients was
surgery and, afterwards, extensive
rehabilitation. However, within the
last few months, important break-

I throughs in stroke research have

emerged at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center.

The University of Pittsburgh

f Medical Center Stroke Institute is one
of 50 medical centers currently partic-

 

ipating in an international study on a
new drug that is thought to lessen the
effects of stroke after stroke onset.
The new drug, Lubeluzol, that is
being tested by UPMC, was created to
protect the brain cells surrounding the

i 0 center of the stroke impact when deal-

ing with what is known as an occlu-

A, sion stroke.

In the event of an occlusion
stroke, a process called ischemic cas-

~ cade occurs during which poisonous

chemical reactions affect the brain

' and rapidly spread outward destroy-
. ing thousands of cells. The drug
' Lubeluzol serves as an obstacle and

halts the expansion of the reaction
which allows for a much greater
degree of cell recovery and a better
possibility of the patient leading a

normal life in the future

Guided by the UPMC Stroke
Institute Director, Dr. Lawrence
Wechsler, the UPMC is undergoing a
clinical study that is testing whether
the Lubeluzol treatment will improve
the patient’s recovery if administered
within eight hours of stroke onset. In
earlier tests, the new drug was found
to be effective.

The only drawback to the drug
appears to be that if Lubeluzol is
given any time after
the eight hour time
period, the patient
will not receive any
of the benefits that
the drug has to
offer.

That eight hour
time limit makes it
even more impor-
tant that people are
taught to catch the
signs of a stroke
early and proceed to the hospital for
the appropriate medical attention,
according to Carol Barch, the clinical
coordinator of the UPMC study.

The UPMC has been participating
in much community involvement and
many activities geared to educating
the public about strokes and stroke
prevention in conjunction with their
study.

If someone were to ask what the

 

third—leading cause of death and the
number one cause of adult disability
within the United States was, most
people would say cancer, heart attack
or AIDS. In fact, it is surprising for
many to discover that the answer to
the question is strokes.

It has been calculated that this
year, more than 550,000 Americans
will suffer a stroke and that out of
those people, more than one—third will
experience long-
term, painful
impairment, espe-
cially of the
body’s motor
functions.’

Members of
the educational
team continually
stress the impor-
tance of following
good eating habits
and exercising on
a regular basis since heart disease and
high blood pressure are linked to an
increased risk of stroke.

The staff also urges people to be
on the alert for what is known as a
TIA, or warning stroke. People expe-
rience the symptoms of a stroke in a
TIA but many do not report their dis-
comfort because the symptoms go
away for a short time.

The UPMC Stroke Team strongly

urges all people who feel one—sided
weakness or numbness of the body,
sudden blurred or decreased vision in
the eyes, sudden severe unexplainable
headache, and extreme dizziness and
loss of coordination to immediately
contact the hospital before a stronger,
more intense stroke occurs.

The UPMC also frequently visits
areas where there is a high concentra-
tion of elderly people in order to
speak with them about the importance
of ﬂoor monitors in their homes, to
create neighborhood watch programs,
and to distribute publications and
pamphlets discussing stroke safety
and precautions.

“All of these programs are very
much needed, because Allegheny
County is the second oldest county in
the state,” Barch said.

It is very appropriate that the
county with the second highest elder-
ly population in the state of
Pennsylvania should have what is
quite possibly the best stroke institute
on the East Coast.

The UPMC Stroke Institute has
taken an important part in recent
stroke developments and break-
throughs as seen with the drug
Lubeluzol, and another drug known as
TPA, which was approved in June of
1996 as being an effective deterrent to

State rep is disgusted with FA IegisIaIure's Irealment of schools :

_|-jlillary Stevenson

   

State Rep. Mike Veon (D—Beaver
Falls) is disgusted with the level of sup-
port that the state legislation has given to
Pennsylvania’s colleges and universities.
Veon said the state has been more talk
than action when it comes to funding our
schools.

Veon will introduce into the state leg-
islation on Sept. 23 a bill that would
guarantee full scholarships to students of
Pennsylvania high schools who graduate
in the top 10 percent of their class.

The proposal, dubbed the Hope
Scholarship Program, comes on the heels
of President Bill Clinton’s request for

.~-sq-,.-_-.,_.,....~...,~....-.r_. -,—: ._.--~

states to make higher education a reality
for more of their residents. It is modeled
after a program started by the state of
Georgia in 1993.

Pennsylvania has the second most
expensive state schools in the country.
Due to recent budget cuts many of these
schools have seen a rise in their tuition
while community colleges have wit-
nessed cuts in their budgets.

‘The Pennsylvania legislation has

not been willing to put its money where

its mouth is,” Veon said. “The bottom
line is this: other states provide more
money for their education systems. We
rank 47th on the list of states who provide
support.”

Veon said the program is meant to

meet three goals: one, to provide scholar-
ship opportunities for students; two, to
decrease increasing debt faced by future
college graduates; and three, to provide
an “incentive for high school seniors to
do well, work hard, get good grades and
to graduate.”

The scholarship would cover tuition
and fees for any qualifying student who
attends a state, state-related or communi-
ty college, and maintains at least a 2.0
grade point average.

“We want to include as many stu-
dents as possible in this program,” said
Veon. “That is why the cost of room and
board is not covered by the scholarship.”

An estimated 12,000 students per
year would be eligible for the award at a

Although a funding mechanism for "V

the proposal has yet to be decided upon,
Veon said he would like to see the state’s 3
General Assembly redirect portions of
the non-preferred funding in the state 5
budget to the scholarship program. *
Currently, non-preferred funding goes
partly toward the support of state univer- .
sities and select private schools such as
the University of Pennsylvania.

While some components of the bill .

still have to be finalized, Veon said the ‘-
scholarship program is only the begin-

ning of his efforts to assist future college =
students and their families with the ﬁnan— '

ing college.

Strokes

strokes within three hours of stroke
onset. __
However, the UPMC Stroke
Institute’s critical involvement is 5
nothing new. The UPMC has worked 
in the stroke research field for over a if

V cial burden they may face while attend- I

 

decade under such doctors as Roger 

Simon,

who first described the .

process by which brain cells die after 3
stroke in 1984, Doctors Yonas and 

Jungreis who strengthened the Stroke
Institute throughout the 1980s, and

now Lawerence Wechsler, who is .
overseeing impressive new gains in 1?

stroke medicine and therapies.

While many of the programs and 7'
studies occurring within the UPMC 5,
Stroke Institute are centered on elder- -
ly patients, this by no means suggests 1
that younger people cannot experi- ;

ence a stroke.

People of all ages can feel the 
effects of stroke including young 1.!
children and teenagers. While the 

most common type of stroke among 4*

children and young adults is AVM,
alterial Venus malformation, a type
that is recoverable only through
surgery, it is not improbable that
some children and young adults can
experience occlusion strokes.

Women who take birth control
pills on a regular basis, for instance,
have a higher risk of occlusion
stroke.

Also, according to Carol Barch, ’

the UPMC Stroke Institute is interest— I
ed in educating young adults about 
stroke not only for their health rea- ;
sons but for their parents’ health as 
well. ~

Many times, older parents will 1‘;

contact their sons and daughters if
they are not feeling well. If their chil-
dren can catch the symptoms of a

stroke in time and get their parents 

the medical attention they need, that 

is one less stroke victim and one
more stroke survivor. V

Facully dean looks to decenlralize admisiralive power

Lisa McCIenclon

 

Professor Frank Giarratani spends his
days analyzing why things are located
where they are. He is a professor of region-
al economics, which deals with the spatial
distribution of economic activity for busi-
nesses. This could prove to be an asset to his
new position as associate dean of faculty
affairs.

“I have the easiest job. One of the rea—
sons this is, is there has never been another
associate dean for this position. This is a
new position,” Giarratani said. “All I have
to do is not mess it up.’It’s not like I have to
improve the faculty. We’ve got a terrific fac-
ulty. It’s one of the jewels of the University.”

Giarratani earned his Ph.D. in econom-
ics from West Virginia University in 1975.
Four years later, he began his career at Pitt
in the Economics Department. Now he is
interested in turning over the decision—mak-
ing to each particular department involved.

According to Giarratani, the centraliza-
tion of decision—making in the University’s
administration doesn’t work because there
is too small of a group of people trying to
make too many decisions.

Also Giarratani said he believes that
decisions involve knowing all of the rele-
vant information, and no one knows better
than the people in those departments being
affected by a particular decision.

“The more that you can push the deci-
sion—making down to where the information

 

is, the better off that you are going to be,”
Giarratani said. “I want to promote the
decentralization of decision—making at Pitt
as much as possible.”

In recent years, he has been working on
a collaborative project, funded by the Sloan
Foundation, on the economic restructuring
of the American steel industry, which result-
ed in the publication of his recent book “The
Renaissance of American Steel.”

As a member of the provost’s ad hoc
committee, he has helped to review and
improve both the undergraduate and gradu-
ate parts of Arts and Sciences.

“What I have to do is to identify ways
to help the faculty,” Giarratani said. “The
most important thing I intend to do is knock
on doors.”

‘ she was a guest scholar at the Brookings

Prior to joining SUNY at Albany, Ban

‘served as division chief of the Civil Service

In the course of her career, she has headed

large scale evaluations of public sector programs
and provided consulting and training services to
federal and state agencies and to the World Bank
and the Morozov project in Russia. She is also the
author of “How Do Public Managers Manage?,”
“Bureaucratic Constraints,” and “Organizational
Culture and the Potential for Reform” as well as
various articles for many journals.

Ban’s appointment leaves only six empty
places in the Pitt administration. The search com-
mittee for a new business school dean was recon-

 

stituted in August, after three finalists were named
in April to possibly replace H.J. Zoﬂ°er, who
resigned last summer.

Medical School Dean George Bemier also
resigned last summer. Pitt’s chief fundraiser,
Larry Weber, left open the post of vice chancellor
for institutional advancement last October. In
February, Ben Tuchi, senior vice chancellor for
business and ﬁnance, resigned. The position of
senior vice chancellor for the health sciences also
remains open, as does the position of vice chan-
cellor of student and public affairs due to Leon
Haley’s resignation in July.

Assembly is

Avenue to house Computer

Information Services, the administration

and support staff of College of Business

, Administration and ﬂie Psychology depart-
ment.

Another project outlined in this pro-

i posal was the construction of a convocation

and

"center. Varsity Athletics would move into -

the convocation center and free up Trees
Hall and the Fitzgerald Field House for
other students.

The University Senate hopes to draw
more state funding for these projects as well
as individual ﬁmding for the construction of
a $6 million addition to the Hillman
Library.

Pack said that the University has
always anticipated money ﬁom private
sources and that Pitt was in discussion with
one source about a possible donation.

 Revenue created by tuition increases
§ will also contribute to the monumental
I ftmding required for these programs.

5 The other 60 percent of the proposed
I budget calls for renovations and preserva-

tion of buildings such as Belleﬁeld Hall, the
Masonic Temple and classrooms through-
out the carnpus. ‘

Plans for the Masonic Temple include
putting the offices of admissions, govem-
mental relations, alumni affairs, and gov-
ernmental relations in the building.

The proposed renovations of Belleﬁeld

for the FAS arts project will not happen, and I

there will be no separate building for the
College of Business Administration.

Another focus of the Capital Plan is to
increase the current undergraduate housing
ﬁom 5,000 to 6,000 beds on the Oakland
campus. ,

The Capital Planning Document was
developed for the Board of Trustees which
demanded a solid plan for Pitt’s ﬁiture
before it would proceed with fundraising.

“The University has been dead in the
water in terms of external funding for years
now,” McDuﬂie said. He said that meetings
had begun with a consulting ﬁrm over the
best ways to handle fund raising.

Other issues discussed at the Faculty

Assembly meeting was a report delivered
by Professor Nathan Hershey on the issue
that vendor parking on the Pitt campus be
discussed.

The expanded executive committee
had brought up the topic in the interest of
the great expenses Pitt will be undertaking
to improve the aesthetic beauty of the carn-
pus. Certain safety considerations and the
enforcement of proper parking laws also
generated discussion in the matter.

Professor Philip Wion quoted a letter
from Chancellor Mark Nordenberg which
stated that a 3.5 percent increase from
raised tuition resulted in a 2.5 percent cost
of living increase in faculty pay. There is a
1 percent pay increase based on merit as
well, as a result of the budget which was
passed this this June.

In new business, Professor Mark
Ginsberg raised two issues. The first was
that the part time faculty had applied for
unemployment, but the University had
developed a system to challenge the appli-
cations for unemployment. The second was
developing a new procedure for settling
grievances and conducting mediation
between supervisors and employees.

Move over Hitler,
here comes Hussein

With the Evil Empire being evil no more, we
need a perennial villain in order to defend truth,
justice and the American Way. Fortunately,
Saddam Hussein was able to step into the formi-
dable shoes of Soviet Communism. What we
have been wondering is why this problem wasn’t
solved the first time.

When we started the Gulf War, it was to pro-
tect the Kuwaiti from the advances of the Iraqi
Army under the command of Saddam Hussein.
He was likened to Hitler. It was our duty as the
only surviving superpower to see that he be
stopped. Yellow ribbons were hung proudly and
patriotism reigned. We were going to kick the
bad guy’s butt. George Bush asked us to rally
and got the highest approval ratings of his presi-
dential career. He was the fearless leader who
took us to victory, or so we thought.

Apparently, the only things Desert Storm.

accomplished were to give Gulf War syndrome
to our service people and to make Colin Powell
popular enough to be courted as a presidential
candidate. Saddam Hussein is back, and it’s the
same old song and dance.

President Clinton has approved economic
and military retribution against Saddam Hussein
for using his troops to push into Kurdish territo-
ry. Will we see some results this time? We need
leaders with the strength to see a crisis and take
the measures necessary to deal with it. These
measures may not be pretty, but they are effec-
tive. Leadership isn’t about ribbons. It’s about
action. ‘

How many lives would have been saved if
things had been taken care of the first time? If we
entered the Gulf War to protect theqKuwaitis as
was claimed, and notisolely to protect our oil
interests, these current transgressions being
made by Saddam Hussein are a failure on our
part.

It is time for our leaders to stand up and be
counted. This problem isn’t going to go. away

with rhetoric and posturing. We can’t rally-

around the flag and hope for the best. As citizens
of this country, it is our duty and our right to
question our leadership. Could this current situa-
tion have been avoided through past action? And
if so, why wasn’t it? Was it simply that our elect-
ed officials wanted a villain to keep in reserve
for when their approval ratings needed a boost?

We demand that the job he done right this
time. Throughout time, great leaders have made
tough decisions with promising results. If our
current leaders need to hit the history books to
learn how, we suggest they get to it.

Welcome to the Nation of Speed Junkies

 

All racquet sports are not creat-
ed equal. Tennis is a sport of poise
and grace, made for royalty to play
on their well-kempt lawns in crisp,
white attire. Tennis can be a
metaphor for life at its ﬁnest.
Racquetball, on the other hand, is
placing someone in a cage to show
off their yuppy prestige and aggres-
siveness.

Perhaps the most glaring differ-
ence is the arena in which each is
played. Tennis is meant to be played
in the open air and sunlight. Even
indoor tennis courts are spacious.
One is meant to take his/her time and
enjoy the day as much as the game in
tennis. Racquetball courts are ﬂuo-
rescent lit cubicles. Instead of getting
into the open air and escaping from
our unnatural everyday working
world, one stays in a dungeon of
cement to play racquetball.

Tennis is» a game to be played

with respect and manners, qualities
that do not show themselves very
often in today’s society. There is
something to be said about a game in
which each player is to treat their
opponents with dignity. Though it
might not always come to pass, as
John McEnroe comes to mind, ten-
nis is meant to be a game of pleases
and thank you’s. In tennis, it is in
poor form to not be gracious.
Though aggression plays a part in
tennis, it is to be subtle.

There is an art to the game of
tennis which is completely lost in
racquetball. Gone is the precision
drop shot and well—placed serve.
Instead, one is simply to beat the ball‘
against a wall. There is no give and
take. as in tennis. In tennis, it is you
against your opponent, and the way
to win is to out-ﬁnesse the other per-
son. It is not about brute force.

Racquetball is a symbol of what
our hedonistic culture has become.
We are a nation of instant gratiﬁca-
tion—seeking powermongers. Instead

 

of spending an afternoon in a game
of tennis, we would rather up every-
thing out of tennis that makes it great
and spend thirty minutes trapped like
rats with balls ﬂying at us from all
sides. Gone is the tradition and
pageantry of tennis whites meant to
leave one’s eye to pay attention to the
skill and beauty of the game, not the
player’s greatness. It has been
replaced by bright colored spandex
to draw attention to ourselves like a
giant billboard.

It is not to say that tennis is the
only victim of our race to inake
everything bigger and faster. We
have lost our ability to stop and smell
the roses. It is better to race across the
country m a jet than to take the time
to take in the sights from the window
of a train, and it is easier to turn on
the T.V. than to pick up a book for,
horror of horrors, entertainment.

We have become speed junkies. C

The fact that we would take an activ-
ity like tennis and turn it into rac-
quetball stands as a testament to that.

Political Conventions lead to voter disenchantment

 

 

The Democratic
Convention came and went last week
and, predictably, it was all the rage in
the media. Bill Clinton gave a ﬂamboy-
ant campaign speech and landed right
where he wanted to be, on every front
page in America. He outlined plans for
part two of his administration, mere
hoopla and rhetoric which add up to a
big pile of empty words and worthless
promises.

Bob Dole did the same thing earlier
in the summer. Ross Perot has been
doing it on and off since 1992 and
might keep doing it forever. Shouldn’t
we be noticing a pattern here? Every
candidate is busy spewing promises
about taxes and jobs, the standard elec-

‘ tion issues. At the same time, however,

they fear making a political mistake and
so refuse to remark about the real issues
confronting America. Who can think of
anything worse than a candidate alien-
ating part of the the potential voting
population because he took the wrong
stand on, say, abortion? What does any
of this accomplish? Nothing. No matter
who gets elected, the promises and the
real issues go unmet.

What happened to health care
reform? We heard about nothing else
during the 1992 political song and

National.

dance. But what kind of issue is it now?
It gets mentioned from time to time, just
to assure us that it hasn’t been forgot-
ten, but where’s the action? Politicians
make the claims they know the public
wants to hear. Then, when they land in
Washington, our forsaken system
allows them to focus on pork barrel
deals and back room kickbacks. The
agenda of the American people, the real
agenda, gets ignored. 

What does it mat-
ter who gets elected?
It’s always the same
story no matter who is
in the oval office.
Naturally, there are
plenty of reasons,
excuses, really, why
this is. Each president,
we are supposed to
believe, walks into the
White House with the
best of intentions.
Sure, they realize that
none of their predecessors have been
able to accomplish their lofty goals but
think, for some reason, that their adInin—
istration will be different. They work as
hard as they can, but are confronted
with a stubborn Congress that refuses to
cooperate. The old boy network ‘on
Capitol Hill makes sure nobody gets
hung out to dry.

This may be, but every political

candidate, from a presidential hopeful
to a grass roots newcomer aspiring to
win a seat in the Senate preaches on the
same issues. It would seem that, as they
all agree on what needs to be done, they
could manage a little progress. After all,
that’s why they got elected in the first
place. And if our system of government
just can’t facilitate the cooperation we
so obviously need, maybe it’s time for
us, the people, to over-
haul the system. It’s
200 years old. With all
that’s changed since
our forefathers wrote
the Constitution, is it
really so difficult to
believe that it just
doesn’t work anymore?
No one, from politi-
cians to the ‘public,
seems to want to listen.
No one seems to want
to vote anymore.
Would the candidates
vote if there wasn’t a camera crew fol-
lowing them around for publicity shots?
Who’s responsible for our country these
days? It seems like the controls in
Washington are set for automatic pilot
while everybody tries to pretend every-
thing is fine and hopes all the problems
will fix themselves.

My point is simple. When our
country was founded, each person had a

vested interest in how the‘ government
was set up and they made their opinions
known. There was good reason for such
behavior. Our forefathers came from a
land of tyranny, wanted to live in a
country where individual rights were
respected and protected. These words
should still be true today, but are not.
Americans have become jaded. We
have come to take liberty for granted
and turned our collective backs on
Washington.

Look what has come from that.
Politicians, being cunning individuals,
have noticed the peoples’ absent atti-
tude and taken advantage of it. Their
pockets are getting padded and the gen-
eral public is getting hung out to dry.

Our futures are being jeopardized
by all of this ignorance. Issues need to
be faced and decisions made. If the
country someday falls completely apart,
it won’t be the elite upper class, from
which most politicians come and like to
protect, that suffers. It will be the com-
mon people, the middle and lower
classes. Chances are that’s you and me.

Who cares if it’s a Republican or a
Democrat who gets elected? The impor-
tant things won’t get done anyway. We

- need to worry more about making the

system work. I don’t care who does it,
just as long as someone finally does.

Pitt free safety John Jenkins is the Panther’s most experienced defensive
player and the vocal leader of the defense. 1

bewildered
Piﬂ defense

 

If you’ve seen John Jenkins
walking around campus lately, you
may have noticed the extra weight he
is carrying around with him.

It’s not that Jenkins is taking
extra classes this semester. And the
extra weight is not from his rigorous
off—season training.

No, Jenkins is carrying around
the load of the whole Pitt defense
with him.

Jenkins is one of the leaders of
the Pitt defense, and as the starting
free safety, he carries around a lot of
responsibility.

“It’s an awkward situation,”
Jenkins said. “Everyone looks to me
for the calls and checks. That adds
focus on the secondary. It’s very
intense.” _

That intensity is what has led
Jenkins to become a very dependable
player for Coach Johnny Majors.
Jenkins had a solid and largely unno-
ticed season last year. Jenkins led the
team in interceptions last year with
four and was also the team’s fourth-
leading tackler with 54 stops (34
solo), impressive statistics from a
1995 team that yielded an average of
29.9 points per game.

After surrendering a whopping
34 points to West Virginia last
Saturday, some Pitt fans are wonder-
ing if this year will be more of the
same.

But Jenkins has remained posi-
tive.

“I think the defense will improve.
We have talent.” Jenkins said. “These
young guys have some experience
but we have to stay focused. This
year, it’s more serious.”

The “guys” Jenkins is speaking
of are the Panther secondary. Along
with Jenkins,,they include strong
safety Curtis McGhee and defensive
backs Chuck Brown and Rasshad
Whitmill. These players are focused
on improving from last year’s mis-
takes.

Staying focused was certainly a
major problem for the Panther

defense in 1995. Repeatedly, the
Panthers were burned for big plays
that turned competitive contests into
blow-outs. Jenkins last year was
called on to make many of the solo
tackles behind the defense. In order
to stay competitive this year, the
Panthers must eliminate the big
plays.

Case in point was the fourth play
from scrimmage for West Virginia.
Rookie Amos Zereoue bursted down
the left side of the ball for a 69-yard
scoring run and an early 7-0 lead.
The game that followed Zereoue’s
run was not pretty.

“There was a lot of blown assign-
ments [against West Virginia],”
Jenkins noted. “That puts a lot of
stress on the safeties.”

“We made a lot of mental mis-
takes. We had people lined up
wrong,” Jenkins said. “There was a
lot of mental things that went wrong.
That’s what we tried to stress all
camp-long.”

But when asked if the threat of
the big plays caused him to play
more cautiously, Jenkins acquiesced.

“You can’t play cautious,”
Jenkins responded. “You have to
trust your reads and trust the players
around you. Open field tackles are
my job.”

And there’s every indication that
Jenkins will do his job well. The
sociology major did an admirable job
last year as the sophomore stop gap
for the Pitt defense. He started all 11
games at free safety in 1995 after
playing all 11 games as a reserve
defensive back- in 1994. In that year,
he registered 24 total tackles (16
solo) and earned his first varsity let-
ter as a redshirt freshman.

But Jenkins’ success did not
come as a surprise to the Pitt coach-
es. Jenkins came out of high school
as one of the top athletes in the
WPIAL, earning school MVP awards
in football, basketball and baseball
for nearby East Allegheny. In high
school, Jenkins played both wide
receiver and defensive back. Jenkins
shattered former Panther star Gordon

Keith Hoetzlein ejected for Big East
opener Sunday against Providence

The Pitt soccer squad is only
two games into the season, and
already, they have two streaks to
worry about.

First, the team’s 2-1 victory
over SUNY—Buffa1o Wednesday
night gives the Panthers a two-
game winning streak to startthe
season as they head into Big East
competition for the first time
Sunday against Providence.

Second, Dean Astorino’s laser-
beam shot past Buffalo goalie
Christian Barletta gives the Pitt
senior a two—game scoring streak
— another number the team ‘wants
to see increase after Sunday’s
matchup.

“He takes some pressure off me’

and the rest of the team,” said Pitt
sophomore Drew Kopp, whose
penalty kick would prove to be the
game winner against the Bulls.

Kopp’s shot put the Panther
lead at 2-0, after a first half that
was dominated by the Bulls’ offen-
sive push.

Early in the first, Buffalo mid-
fielder Brian Cruickshank got off
the first clean shot on goal, but was
denied by Adam Spitzer for the
goalie’s first save. Cruickshank’s
teammate Tim Merrick came back
with a wide—open shot moments
later, but sailed it wide and over
the crossbar to end the scoring
attack.

The ball stayed near midfield
for the rest of the half and the
beginning of the second, until a
Panther offensive push resulted in a
near—miss from Pitt defenseman
Bret Stezoski. The Panthers kept
the ball in the attack zone until
crisp passing from forwards Kopp
and Keith Hoetzlein finally set up
Astorino for the score.

“We didn’t finish our chances
early,” said Head Coach Joe
Luxbacher. “I don’t think we were
making good decisions, [but] early
in the season,  the key is to hang
close, and find a way to win.. We’ve
done that. It’s good to start 2-0.”

Jenkins 

Jones’ school record of 14 intercep-
tions by collecting 23 career inter-
ceptions.

For the past two seasons, Jenkins
has also been an integral player on
special teams. Last year, he averaged
11.2 yards per punt returns. This
year, Jenkins will be the primary punt
returner and may also handle some of
the kickoff duties.

That’s a heavy workload for one
player to bear. But as a redshirt
junior, Jenkins’ responsibilities go
beyond playing safety or even return-
ing kicks. That is because Jenkins is
considered the vocal leader of the
defense, an intangible that can not be
measured by statistics, but can be

 
   

seen by the coaches and astute fans.
Often, Jenkins is seen trying to pump
up teammates, his voice being heard
above the crowd.

A knock against the Panthers last
season was their lack of intensity. In
the second half against West
Virginia, the Panthers looked lethar-
gic.

But Jenkins doesn’t see team
intensity as a problem.

“We had intensity all through
camp,” Jenkins said.

Another positive going into the
Kent game is that the Golden Flash
are not nearly the caliber opponent
that West Virginia was.

But according to Jenkins, that

doesn’t matter. ,

“It’s gonna be the same mentally.
Whether we’re playing Kent, Notre
Dame, Tennessee, whatever, we’re
going to be mentally tough,” Jenkins
said. “It’s a matter of regrouping and
knowing that we have 10 more games
left.”

Jenkins certainly has the right
attitude following the first game, and
when asked how the Panthers could
bring back enthusiasm to the campus,

Jenkins gave a simple and straight— V

forward answer.

“Win,” Jenkins said. “Period.”

Against Kent on Saturday, John
Jenkins will certainly do all he can
do to do just that.

t  fer, won't

"help their

defense
Saturday
against Pitt.

Will Dick Bender give Kent more flash?

 

even more wrong than swearing at
Grandma or swiping change from the col-
lection plate. Those things are wrong.

Like feeding a seagull an Alka—Seltzer
tablet or tying two cats’ tails together and
hanging them from a clothesline, last
week’s prediction was way off. But don’t
kid yourself into believing that you knew
the Panthers would get an old—fashioned
whooping from West Virginia. Almost
everyone on this campus thought, or want-
ed to think, that Pitt really did have a shot at
winning its season opener. It’s over and
done with and we can’t go back and change
anything. All we can do at this point is thank
the football scheduling gods for the name
“Kent” on the schedule this Saturday.

Pitt is favored by 30 points this week-
end and there is no way the Panthers can
lose. Granted, West Virginia came in here
and sent a message to the team, the fans and
even a couple sheep out near Cranberry, or
so I hear. But Kent is different. These fools
lost to Miami of Ohio 646 last week. They
are also one of the few teams that has been
consistently worse than the Panthers over
the past few seasons. In 1995, the Golden
Flash went 1-9-1 and have managed to win
only eight games in the past seven seasons
(8—68—1).

There is no point in wasting your time,
my time, or anyone else’s comparing the
players on these two teams. There is not one
player on the Golden Flash squad better
than any second-teamer the Panthers throw
into the ﬁre week in and week out. It’s
frightening, but it’s the truth.

Don’t believe the garbage about Pitt
fans drowning their sorrows after last
week’s loss. The fact is, most fans were
drunk when they got there, drank more
while they were in the stadium and pro-
ceeded to get even more liquored after the
game. Pitt could have won 70-0 and it
wouldn’t change a thing with the blood
alcohol level of the fans. Moral of the story:
unforttmately, the only real way to enjoy a
Pitt game in recent memory has been to hit
the bottle a tad. Sony AA, but this week will
be no different. '

I’ve decided to delve into the innards of
this matchup a little differently this time,
and maybe it will give everyone a little bit
more stupid stuff to talk about as they get
their drink on Saturday. _

Pitt has been around for over 200 years
and the football team has been getting its
groove on since 1890. Kent, on the other
hand, began as- Kent Normal College in
1915 and became-Kent State University in
1935. Only in the last couple years has the
institution dropped the State ﬁom its name,
probably because of the honible incident in
the early ‘70s that was dubbed simply the
“Kent State Massacre.” I lmow, I know, it’s
an easy joke to go on but I have a little more
couth than that.

The Panthers are one of the most suc-
cessful college football teams in history,

while the Golden Flash have had only 24.

winning seasons in 81 years. Other than in
the late 1940s, the only time Kent State was
good came in 1973 when the only player
anyone ever remembers ﬁom Kent State
was there: #99 Jack Lambert. Lambert went
on to be a star with the Pittsburgh Steelers
and wear #58, but while in college ‘”Ihe
Stork,” as he was so affectionately called,
ruled‘the defense with an iron ﬁst. Now he’s
a park ranger outside of Pittsburgh.

The only other Flash players to have
their jerseys retired are “Big” Jim Conigal
and Eric “Silk” Wilkerson; “Who are they?”
you ask. Exactly my point. Advantage:

Pitt
One of my favorite comparisons for a
game as lopsided as this one has always
been the name game. Put simply, which
team has the guy with the coolest name. The
Panﬂiers have some nifty ones locked away
like Waldemer Zeig (1904—l907), Octavius
Uansa (1927-1929), and the Stoner broth-
ers, Fred and Reynold from the early 70s.
All the Flash could muster was John
Massirniani, Howard Wolfgram and James
DeOreo. However, Kent State has the upper
hand this weekend in the name game. V
Pitt isn’t too bad with the likes of
Charlie Brown and E.C. Varoutsos, but
none can beat 6-3, 260 pound defensive
lineman for the Flash, Richard Bender.
Think about it. Advantage: Kent
Sometimes it takes teams a while to get
used to the live action —— maybe a game or
two. VV1th this being the case, the second
game of the season often plays a big part -in
how the year will unfold. Kent hasn’t been
a very successful squad in the second game
over the years. In fact, since their inception
in 1915, the Golden Flash are 24—45—3.
On the other hand, the Panthers are a
big second—garne team compiling a 53—32—8
since putting on the pads for the-first time in
1890. Not bad, not bad at all. Advantage:
Pitt
Finally, there is one little quirk that
guarantees a win for Pitt. While leaﬁng
through the Kent media pamphlet this week
I stumbled upon a strange and frightening
fact that would make Ben Franklin turn
over in his grave. In 1991, Kent hosted
Cincinnati in the only night game ever at
Dix Stadium. No lights — what is this:
junior high? Big Dick Bender and his merry
bunch of Gremlins will have a hard time
adjusting to the vicious lights that drown
Pitt Stadium at dusk. This is what the
Panthers need every week Pitt 31-13.

S An in-depth look at Kent

1

Mike Kovak

 

The mere fact that the Kent football
program is in a struggle to obtain Division
I NCAA certification should be an indica-
tion of just how bad their team is on the
field.

The Mid-American conference pat-
sies, fresh off a drubbing at Miami (Oh),
are headed by Coach Jim Conigall, who’s
compiled a 3—l9—l record in tl1ree~plus
seasons at Kent.

One interesting tidbit about Kent is
that they boast two of the ten shortest
players in Division I football. Sophomore
wide receiver Kahlil Byers ranks as the
shortest player in college football — tip-
ping the charts at 5-foot-3. Defensive back
Ben Durant stands m at 5—foot—6, placing
him in a nine—way tie for eighth place.

The Golden Flashes are lead by
junior tailback Astron Whatley.-During his
ﬁrst two seasons at Kent, Whatley has
amassed 1,981 career rushing yards..He
holds Kent’s freshman rushing record
(1,003 yards) and ranks second in sopho-
more single—season rushing (978 yards).
He needs only 275 yards this season to
move into the school’s top four all-time
rushers. J

On offense, Kent returned eight

starters from last year’s 1-9-1 squad.
Much like Pitt, Kent has three quarter-
backs that could be called upon at any
minute. The starter is sophomore Matt
Goebbel, who completed 75 of 164 pass-
es for 792 yards last season. Seniors Mark
O’B1ien and Lance Reisland have also
seen signiﬁcant playing time.

The receiving core is headed by
Lance Hansen and Kantroy Walker. Both
guys had 328 yards receiving last year,
Hansen on 23 catches and Walker on 28.
Look for sophomore, and Shadyside
Academy grad, Eugene Baker to play as
well. He led the Golden Flashes in receiv-
ing during fall camp.

Kent believes they have a good tight
end in senior O.J. Santiago. He’s big, 6-
foot-7 and 270 pounds, can block, and is
one of the team’s leadingreceivers from
last season, hauling in 28 catches for "297
yards and two touchdowns.

On defense, Kent retums six starters
ﬁom last year, including four of the top
ﬁve tacklers. Junior linebacker Justin
Sanford led the Mid-American confer-
ence with an average of 13.9 tackles per
game. Senior Joe Karr registered 125
tackles last season, good enough for third
on the team. Unfortunately, Jack Lambert
graduated from Kent in 1973 and is ineli-
gible for this game.

An in-depth look at Pitt

Offensive Iinea question mark after
poor performace against WVU

Geoff Mock

 

They are the most overlooked, under-
appreciated players on almost any foot-
ball team. They don’t have the automatic
spotlight that a quarterback or a running
back enjoys. They rarely even get to make
the kind of big plays that can make any

defensive player famous. They usually,

only get noticed when something goes
wrong.

Last weekend against West Virginia,
it was painfully obvious that something
went wrong for the Pitt offense.

Coach John Majors has already said
that the quarterback play was not the
problem in that game. Nor can the blame
be put on the running game. Everybody in
Pitt Stadium knew that Billy West would
get the ball early and often. He still man-
aged a respectable 4.2 yards per carry.
The receivers didn’t have a great game,
but it was well-known that they were a
thin group. That leaves the offensive line.

There sirnp1y_shou1d have been more

offense for the Panthers. Against West
Virginia, a team whose defense was sup-

posed to be suspect at best, the Pitt‘

offense, supposedly a strength, should
have been able to muster more than 101
yards of total offense.

The offensive line allowed eight
sacks last week. During the whole 1995
season, Pitt allowed only 14 sacks. You
could argue that Matt Lytle was too quick
to leave the pocket, which caused some of
the sacks, but still  eight sacks?

‘That was not our greatest effort,”
Pitt center Reggie Thomas said. “We’re a
better line than you saw last wee .”

Pitt also had only 27 yards rushing.
That works out to less than one yard per
carry. Having ineffective running backs is
one thing, but to get that little yardage is
usually the fault of the big men up front.

The most troubling thing about the
offensive line’s performance is that they
were supposed to be one of Pitt’s
strengths this season. It was well known

-v O-UNE, PAGE 18 mm

 

 

THE PITT NEWS _ .T|1ur$duy, September 5, I996

 

 

FROM PAGE 17

 

O-line

that Pitt’s defense, which lost seven
starters from last season, would have to
be revamped. The “quarterback contro-
versy” has been well—documented.

The offensive line was supposed to
be different. Four of five starters returned.
They are the veteran group. The season is
less than 10 percent complete, so it still is
too soon to give up on the linemen or
anyone else on the team. The line certain-
ly isn’t giving up on itself. Still, if anyone
has to adjust something before this week-
end’s game against Kent, the offensive
line is it.

First of all, they need to keep quar—
terback Matt Lytle comfortable in the
pocket. A healthy portion of those eight
sacks were not a case of the pocket cav-
ing in, but often the sack was only one
thing happening among a ﬂurry of activi-
ty in the backﬁeld.

“We’re not going to do a lot differ-
ently. We’ll clean up our schemes a little
bit. We need to put a little more effort in
this week,” Thomas said.

The line also needs to play a part in
breathing life into the running game.

“We need to open up holes for Billy
West and Dwayne Schulters so they can
get eight or 10 yardsf’ Thomas said. “We
didn’t perform well there last wee .”

Despite last week’s debacle, Thomas
sees hope for the line.

“The coaches have been working us
hard this week,” he said. “You will see
improvement. I guarantee it.”

minutes after Astorino scored, but
another Pitt rush cornered the Bulls
near the 25-minute mark. A Bull
player inadvertently touched the
ball with his hand while in the
g0alie’s box, resulting in Kopp’s
penalty shot. The sophomore sent
the ball high and over Barletta’s
right shoulder to widen the lead.
“We should of had more goals
than we did,” said Kopp, who led
the team in shots in Saturday’s 1-0
win over Duquesne. “Those will
come later. We’re nowhere near
playing as well as we want to yet.”
The Panthers slowed Buffalo’s
offensive desperation after Kopp’s
goal, preserving a shutout until
Merrick got a free kick opportunity
with only a few ticks left. His kick
sailed clearly to Bulls’ freshman
Jason Ballock, who beat Spitzer
and finished the night’s scoring.
“We were playing hectic,” said
Luxbacher of Pitt’s last—second
allowance. “I made a lot of substi-

in there, they’re nervous. [The
Bulls] get back in the game, and
Adam Spitzer loses a shutout on
basically a needless foul.”

After the goal, with the out-
come already decided, the Panthers
continued a third streak when
Hoetzlein was carded and ejected
from the contest. He will miss
Sunday’s Big East opener. Pitt
senior Mike Dyer started this nega-
tive streak with a similar ejection
Saturday that kept him out of
Wednesday’s lineup.

“He made a stupid foul,” said
Luxbacher of Hoetzlein’s late sin.
“Keith is out for Providence. I’ll
bet he’s thinking about that right
now.”

Also out for the game against
the Friars will be sophomore stand-
out Travis Kruse, who is still suf-
fering from a knee sprain. His
absence will speed up the develop-
ment of Matt’s brother, Jeff Dyer,
who has started in Kruse’s place so
far this season. ‘

There are three people in the band
7 Goats. Their motto is “We
Specialize in Making Things Up.”
The first time I saw 7 Goats play at a
field show in ‘94, I was seriously
impressed. After a semi-altercation
with one of the other bands on the
line up concerning who would play
first (the whole thing was a simple
misunderstanding), the Goats took
the stage and launched into a six-
minute set of pure, unadulterated
noise. It was the sort of thing I
expected to hear on the Lower East
Side perhaps, but not in the middle of
Plum Boro. Drummer Kevin Shea

seemed to hover in mid—air while his.

arms ﬂailed about, furiously assault-
ing his drum set. Scott.Prarie creat-
ed further rhythmic noise on his
three—stringed bass, meshing well
with the barrage of sound that Mark
Tierney was wrenching from his sax
and guitar, almost simultaneously.
Their set consisted of one piece of
music, and ended in pieces, with their
equipment in shambles. They satiri-
cally thanked the other band for their

patience and began packing up their
stuff. i

This gives a decent indication of
what you can expect to see/hear when
7 Goats release their new CD,
Floating Deer Head, at Tobacco
Roadhouse on Sept. 11. The only
thing is, Tierney, Shea, and Prarie are
some of the nicest, friendliest musi-
cians in Pittsburgh, and the pissed—off
atmosphere that I experienced on that
summer day two years ago was not at
all typical of the 7 Goats’ Vibe, but it
was a great introduction toone of
Pittsburgh’s most unique PUNK
ROCK outfits.

Scott Prarie formed 7 Goats after
returning to Pittsburgh from Dayton
in 1993. This was just before the big
Dayton—as—hip—music-scenester—town
thing hit the media. Scott had been

playing in Dayton with his pop

group, The Hopefools, which includ-
ed guitarist Dale Phelps and part-
time Guided By Voices’ drummer
Don Thrasher. Both Hopefools and
7 Goats have released a number of
cassette recordings on Dayton’s Gas
Daddy! G0!! label.

Scott describes 7 Goats as “an
attempt to gain freedom from the
ignorance and limitations of old
habits and beliefs.” After I write
down this phrase, he tells me that it’s
something he picked up from his
Tarot cards this morning. The card,
apparently, had been‘ the Tower of
Destruction, and Prarie, having just
pulled the muscles in his back, was
being forced by me to make sense of
his life, his art and his Tarot.

“Our music is really about dredg-
ing out,  making conditions to tell
the truth  It’s all a process, really,”
Prarie begins. “It’s about continually
checking-in, and staying checked-in

' to /your emotional state and then plac-

  

Here we see our hero Scott Prairie mssaging his backside after routine
post-mixing S&M subiection (as interpreted by Kevin ”T he Twinkie" Shea).

ing it out. It comes from something
called out—picturing, which is a visu-
al art term.”

He cites “new dance,” which is
m_ore contemporary than modern
dance, as one of his main inspirations
in life and art. ’

“This isn’t unique," all this stuff
describes the principles of non—jazz
improvisation. We are basically an
improv band.”

The new CD was recorded using
six different sources, ranging from
lo-fi boom-box recordings, four—track
and A—DAT, to 24-track studio
recordings. Each sound snippet was
carefully chosen from close to a hun-
dre'd hours’ worth of material, and
represents a single piece of art that is
very different from the band’s life
performances.

Gathering Storm:

America ’s Militia Threat

by Morris Dees with James Corcoran
Harper Collins, $24.

I had a girlfriend once with a particular theory
on men and guns. She bet that the number of guns a
man owned was proportionate to the level of the
penis size inferiority complex he felt. More guns

_ meant less meat. According to her, gun ownership

was just a misplaced phallic thing. Of course I
could laugh, because I didn’t possess so much as a
plastic squirt—gun.

But while her little theory is probably too sim-
plistic (I’m sure there’s a John Holmes somewhere
in the militia movement), Morris Dees does tap into
the psychology of arms and the man. Dees quotes
author and fellow militia expert James Gibson’s
explanation of the average militiaman’s mindset
saying, “‘I’m not Rich. I’m not powerful. The news
media doesn’t call me and ask me what I think
about things. I don’t have scores of beautiful
women after me. But, by God, I can kill anything
that moves within 35 yards of me and have a good
time doing it.”’

Dees implies that when the government enacts
laws like the Brady Bill or assault weapons bans,
they arouse a misplaced castration anxiety among
this country’s most rabid pistol packers. This leads
more and more American males, whose lives were
previously devoid of ideological activity, to fall
into the hands of militia movement leaders and their
high priests of racist, separatist rhetoric of the ultra-
conservative Fundamentalist Christian clergy.

Dees, as chief trial counsel for the Southern

THE PITT NEWS

Poverty Law Center, is on personal terms with most
of the players in the various factions of clansmen,
preachers, Nazis, and ex—army tough guys that
make up the foul—smelling soup that is far—right
extremism. He’s put a few in jail and kept more
from enacting their bizarre schemes. In Gathering
Storm, the author shows us a letter where one of
these fools challenges Dees to an old—fashioned
duel.

It’s easy for a lot of us on the left to laugh at this
kind of intensely backward intellectual activity
among the radical right, but Dees makes certain we
should not be so complacent. After incidents like
Ruby Ridge and Waco, the militia movement’s
power and popularity culminated in the Oklahoma
City bombing, an event Dees painstakingly ties to
increased far—right activity. Timothy McVeigh and
Terry Nichols were present at several far—right gath-
erings —- pre-Oklahoma City — preaching hate and
guns in a date with destiny. The Southern Poverty
Law Center’s informants provide Dees and
Klanwatch with firsthand accounts of these hate
conventions that allow this book to illustrate the
specific environment that leads to violence.

More importantly, Dees shows how the politi-
cians of the mainstream right give these wackos a
newfound legitimacy. With supportive language
emanating from congressional leaders like Dick
Armey of Texas and others in Newt’s revolution,
many of the militia movement’s leaders admit in
letters and speeches obtained by Dees that they feel
a reinvigoration of their cause. The language of the
new right is a tacit endorsement of the militia
movement according to the movement’s leaders.

uIcu‘s

Republicanism and the unholy nuts who would
blow up federal buildings in the name of God and
white people everywhere is no more perfectly illus-
trated than in the case of Larry Pratt. Pratt, a former
Virginia politico and executive director of some-
thing called Gun Owners of America, dismisses the
NRA’s-second amendment defense efforts as basi-
cally candy-assed. His hard-line approach com-
bined with an ability to move within power circles
in the Republican Party make him more dangerous
than most of the folks Dees introduces us to in this
book.

Pratt is so close to the Republican power circles
that he managed to find a spot as a top official in
Bob Dole’s election campaign. At least until Dees’
revelation about Pratt’s ties to the same extremists
that gave succor and encouragement to the likes of
McVeigh and Nichols were revealed. You may

remember the brief headlines a few months ago .

when Dole was forced to can Pratt from his cam-
paign machine when these ties where made public,
but it seems obvious that Pratt’s relationships with
notorious hatemongers could hardly have been a
secret to Dole and those running his campaign.

The real value of Gathering Storm is just this. It
not only details the histrionics and rhetoric of the
most dangerous organized factions of anti—goVem—
ment zealots, often in their own words, but also
illustrates their rise and inﬂuence among the politi-
cians and power brokers inside the Republican
party, making it harder and harder for us to laugh at
the idea of Newt Gingrich’s picture on the new two
dollar bill to be printed in the year 2050.

“Show of Evil”
written by William Diehl
published by Ballantine Books

Author of silver screen hit Primal Fear, William.

Diehl released another spine—tingling mystery of mur-
der. Set in Chicago, Diehl uses lawyers and detective
characters to entertain his readers with a romantic
melodrama. Aaron Stampler is the estranged mental
patient who was found guilty of murdering a bishop,
and escaped the electric chair ‘because his lawyer,
Martin Vail, convinced the court that he was insane.
Four years later, murders of the same grotesque nature
are happening again. Vail is now the district attorney
and he is close to discovering the truth behind the
case.

The book’s beginning is a little slow because Diehl

nu: pm NEWS.

takes a lot of time describing the romantic strength of
all the characters, most of them being dynamic

lawyers. The murders that take place are gruesome and

frightening and can make a reader’s stomach turn. I
wouldn’t recommend reading these parts after supper.
Diehl doesn’t hold back when it comes to tossing a

little violence into his novel. There is plenty of action ~

in the second half of the book to make up for the
book’s slow start. The clues the characters encounter
lead to Stampler, but he has been institutionalized dur-
ing the recent murders. The characters begin a danger-
ous investigation that takes unsuspected turns and
twists. “Show of Evil” is a thriller that has potential
melodramatic qualities that could propel Diehl’s work
back into the cinemas.

Cypress Hill
Unreleased and Revamped (EP)
Ruffhouse/Columbia

Cypress Hill’s distinct formula
of hit—making has made them popu-
lar with both alternative and rap
fans. Lead rapper B—Real’s nasal
rhymes, DJ Muggs’ eerie beats, and
a dose of some good weed add up to
music that is appreciated by beat-
junkies and potheads alike. Three
albums deep into the rap game,
Cypress faces a critical dilemma:
just how many songs can be written
about the powers of marijuana? In
search of some originality, the
group decided to part company with
the predictable Sen—Dog, who was
Ed McMahon to B—Real’s Johnny
Carson for the first three cam-
paigns.

Unreleased and Revamped is a
step backward in the search for
something different. With only one
song that was previously unre-
leased, this collection of remixes
sounds all too familiar. Remixed by
some of hip—hop’s better producers,
including Q—Tip, Prince Paul,
Diamond D and the Fugees,
Unreleased and Revamped is not a
bad album. It merely sounds like
every other Cypress album.

The Fugees’ Wyclef does an
exceptional job on his standout

remix of “Boom Biddy Bye Bye,”
on which Lauryn Hill’s soulful
background efforts complement B-
Real’s nasal whine perfectly. Guest

appearances by Erick Sermon,
Redman, and MC Eiht add spice to
the “Throw Your Hands in the Air”
remix, but other efforts pale in
comparison to the originals.

“Hits From the Bong,” the ston-
er anthem which became a cult
classic with its catchy lyrics and
well—‘placed samples, should never
have been remade. If it ain’t broke,
why try to fix it? “Whatta You
Know,” the one previously unre-
leased song, is boosted by a track
which is downright scary behind B-
Real’s hard—edged rhymes. In a
weed—induced state of paranoia, he
raps, “Whatta you know, the moth-
erfuckas all blastin’/fo’—five
equallin’ time for subtraction/slot
action, no question/.45 slug is bad
for your complexion.”

Die hard fans of Cypress Hill
will not be disappointed with
Unreleased and Revamped. It
remains to be seen however
whether the group can produce a
creative album full of new material
or whether they will struggle to
keep their ‘ heads above

_(bong)water.

“Maybe next time, we’ll do a full
live recording, rather than a fillet,
like this time.” Prarie continues, “We
want to use this CD as a sort of call-
ing card, to send out, as a means to
get more live shows elsewhere.”

The members of 7 Goats are no
strangers to travelling. Shea also
plays in two of Pittsburgh’s other fine
avant-acts, Storm & Stress and The
Micah Gaugh Trio (formerly 40
Stories), and is commonly regarded
as ' one of the finest drummers in
town, especially in jazz circles.

Prarie, who was classically
trained on the French horn, is heavily
involved in contact improv dancing
and plays regular solo shows, usually

THE PI'I"l' NEWS

at Tobacco Roadhouse. He mentions
possible plans for having a regular
night each week where like—minded
bands could play music, to add some
sort of consistency to the scene.
Bands like 7 Goats, the
Johnsons, the Crawlin’ Low Band,
the whole Rickety Rock thing
(which includes Dead at 24, Tiny
Little Help, the Viragos, and Anita
Fix), and many others are familiar
with just how rewarding certain
aspects of collaboration in art and life
can be. Prarie would like to see a
place where people could go to expe-
rience such mind—blowing acts, and
be able to escape the narrow indie-
mindedness and snobbery that afflicts

so much of the Pittsburgh scene.

A good place for interested par-
ties to begin investigating this new
phenomenon would be the 7 Goats’
CD release party, with the Johnsons
and Matt’s Punk Band From Across

caught the Johnsons live cannot even
imagine what they are missing, and
Prarie describes Matt’s punk band as
being “really, really good, they play

The whole thing kicks off at 9
