.against Georgia Tech and Lafayette.

But the spectators felt that Pitt
hadn’t.“let out” as they could and that
it would have been a “ﬁnk-e" if we‘
had lost. As years of these condi-
tions went by the team suporters suf-
feredga sort oflethargy so far as_
spirit" was concerned and it just took
an upheaval like this year’s to show
the stuff Pittites are made of.
Great Support.

The splendid way that Pittites sup-
ported the team this year through its
reverses will go down in athletic his-
tory something to be proud of.
Never have the students shown the
spirit they dicl this year. The demon-
strations before the Syracuse game,
‘following the Lafayette defeat, and
& J. had.
trimmed  showed that we are good
losers and good stickers when defeat
comes our way. All the Pittsburgh
newspapers commented on this, and
were loud in their praise of the reju-
venated Pllt spirit.

The same spirit was shown by the
alumni and it took more than three
defeats to dampen their spirit at the
State game. The gathering of “grads”
at that game was the largest on rec-
ord and every mother's son of them
rooted hard for at least a tie with the
Although the day
was a terrible one for anyone to be
outdoors, a crowd which slightly ex-
ceeded that at the W. & J. game
packed Forbes Field and stuck until
the last play of the game. Pittites
came from all parts of the country for
the‘ game and went home satisﬁed
that they had seen a real game and
that the Pitt team of 1921 ought to
go down as one of the gamest thati

PITT MAN HAS LONG ‘
JOURNEY FOR W.-J. ‘GAME

 

How would you like to drive an
auto 600 miles through the slush,
‘snow and mud to witness the W. & J.
game and then see Pitt lose? That
was the experience of Wylie W.
Swope, Ex Engr. '17, who traveled
from Saltville, VVa., near the Tennes-
see line, to Pittsburgh, only to see
the Red and Black triumph -over the
Blue and Gold. Swope, with three
other passengers, left Saltville Tues-
day at.5 P. M., -and arrived t P'tts-
burgh Thursday at 8 P. M., an he
reports theey struck all kinds of
weather conditions en route.

Swope is employeed with Kreusler
& Co., engineers, that coming having
the contract--for dismantling a Gov-
ernment chemical plant at Saltville.
The work will take many months yet
to complete. ,

It may be news to Wylie’s friends
to learn that he has been married for
15 months, his wife being the former
Miss Alma Volbrecht of East Liberty.

 

S. J. S«NEE, LAWS, '02,
ELEVATED TO BENCH

Attorney Sylvester J. Snee, elect-
ed judge of the county court. at the
recent election, took his place upon
the bench Saturday, after the oath
of office had been administered by

-. President Judge Richard A. Kenne-
Ady.

The ceremony took place} in
the assignment room of the county
court.

The "room was crowded- with

friends of the new judge and upon
the bench, -banked with ﬂowers,
were the judges ‘of the county court
and Judges Thomas D. Carnahan
and: Stephen Stone of the Common
Pleas bench, who are sitting in
Quarter Sessions court this term.
Many county oﬂicials were in the
audience.
' Juedge Snee did not take office by
virtue of his election, but by ap-
pointment of Governor Sproul. The
increased population of the "county
entitled the county court under an
act of assembly to an additional
judge. Governor ‘Sproul did not ﬁll
the place until after the election,
preferring to wait to appoint the
choice of the electors of the county.
Judge Snee will hold office under
the appointment until January 2,
1922, when the term to Which he
was elected will commence and with
the four other county court judges
who were elected with him at the
last election, he «will be sworn in
again.

Judge Snee graduated from the
University Law School in 1902. He
resides at 235 Alice street; Mt. Oliv-
er.

 

' H. C. GEORGE, ’D6, IN TOWN‘

One’ of the far distant Pittites
who attended the Pit.t-State "game
Thanksgiving was Harold -0. George,
E. M., 1906, who resides at Platte-
ville, Wis. Mines: students of the
early days» Will recall him as one
of the first instructors of that school
at the time he was working for his
Mines degree. Incidentally George
married a Pitt “co>- ed,” the former
Miss Laura Painter, who received
her A. M. degree in 1907.

Two ﬁne children are now meni-
bérs of the George family, and as
is the case with all fond fathers,
George had a _snap shot of Mrs.
George and the two “kiddies” which
he proudly exhibited to ‘.‘Ye Editor”-
the day before Thanksgiving when
he called to pay his respects.

George is employed with the U.
S. Bureau of Mines and worked in
a,, business trip to Pittsburgh to see
the great game with State.

Harman, playing his last game for
Pitt, made a number of good tackles-
and all in all had a. ﬁne day. I

 

  

 

* Those who ‘were’ not at the dance
last iWedne‘-sday evening Awere the
losers. Ask those whovwere there!
And_then make up your mind not
to miss the next one. The weather
man treated us better than for the
past two years and gave us a nice
mild: evening. 'The'music. men were
spoken of "With none but compli-
mentary remarks. The girls who
came brought with them the desire
and spirit for a good tiIncL—also good
dancers. ‘And what else is neces-
sary for a good dancing gparty?

During the» evening Miss Erecil,
’:i31. sang accompanied Etheiyn
B1’--.'>wn, ’21, also Mrs‘. Peg Davis
Loomis, ’l8, accompanied by "Helena
Fmm, ’20. It is a good" thing for
the 1921 class that Miss Frech and.
Miss Brown were there to uphold its
reputation. Otherwise we might
have wondered if there rarely was
a. class of ’21l However no one
who was at the dance doubts it now’
as the numbers given by Miss Frecii
and Miss Brown were delightful.
particularly the second, a lullaby‘ in
Southern dialect That evening was
not the first occasion in which we
had heard Peg sing, but it was the
first in a long time, for she has
been busy with her -baby daughter.
Nor in that time‘ evidently has her
voice been idle, for time and again
was heard the remark that Peg
had never before sung so well. In
fact it would seem that the Class
of ’18 quite walked off with the hon-
ors of the evening, for it showed
also _the la.rg‘est number of grads
present. Credit for this is due not
least of all to Mrs. Mary Johnson
Baird, who worked unceasingly for.
the dance and specially with her
class. And in the same connection
special mention is made of Helen
Donaldson. ’16, Helen McLeod, ’17,
and Betsy Rohrkaste,. '20.

O I I é

Every one was delighted to see our
married folks coming back again,
among them: Mrs. Florence Miller
Willison, Col., ’18, Mrs. Ruth Har-
vey Stubblebine, ICOL, ‘I5, Mrs. Helen
Frost Dice, Col.. '16, the husbands

of whom are Pitt men, Mrs. Mar-
garet Davis Loomis, and Mrs.

There was much greeting and
handshaking———and that's not all——
all evening, but particularly when
Al Musser, '17, and Meta Ebeling,
’20, arrived. - - .

at the dance, is working in the of-

We surely missed Lucille and

recreation and exercise aside from
golf, tennis, dancing and pushing of

siderable crocodile hunting. However,
so far it has been chieflyihunting, for,
like the old clam digger. we have not
seen a “blankety blank” crocodile. The
best in this line which we have done
so far was to shoot.at, kill and bring
home six aligators between six and

ing of the Menorah Society held last
night in Room 301, Alumni Hall. He
‘spoke on “The Jewish Heritage.”

achievements of noted Jewish au-
thors, scientists and diplomats, and
pointed to their work as the guid-
ing star for the present generation.

After his speech, an informal dis-
cussion was held. Many questions
were asked but most of the discus-
sion took the form of opinions of
the members on “The Jewish Herit-
age,” especially along the line out
the Jewish problem in modern times.

1 TD PRACTICE TDNIDDT

Freshman basketball practice starts
today. The candidates will meet
Coach McMaster at Tree Gym at_4:30.
it is likely that no practice will be
indulged today but the coach has a
number of very important instruc-
tions to give the candidates.

Probably about seventy—ﬁve fresh-
men will report to Coach McMaster.
Naturally those who report today
will get the jump on the others.
There is an abundance of good ma-
terial in school and competition for
a number of posit-i'o‘ns should be keen,
with the result that many former
high and prep school stars may have
their troubles even getting on th
squad. . ‘

“Al” Eysell has been appointed
freshman manager. “A1” has a lot of
ability and his appointment is the
reward of hard and willing Work dur-
ing his apprenticeship. He is a junior
in the School of Mines and is an S.
A.- C. Eysell has a very attractive
schedule for the freshmen almost
completed.

The freshman squad is fortunate
in having a coach of the capabilities
of Dr. “Lon” McMaster. McMaster
was a star on the famous Pitt team
of 1916 and knows the game thor-

 

-man in track for three years, cap-
‘taining the team in 1916. He is now
a practicing dentist and is one of the

A dream of Oriental magniﬁcence
and romance brought to life, is the
best phrase describing Pola Negri’sl
wonderful photodrama, “One Arab-2;
ian Night,” which is to be presented
at Pittsburgh’s Million Dollar Grand‘,
all next week, starting Monday morn-?
ing, December 5. Miss Negri, who’
sprang into world fame with her!
great photoplay of the French revo-1
lution, “Passion.” is said to have ai
role in “One Arabian Night” surpass-I
ingintense interest. fascination and,
emotional appeal that of Du Barry:
in her previous success. She is seem
,as a desert dancer. who becomes-
‘quecn of a mighty shie»k"s harem.

For massive settings, colorful cos-l
tumes of gorgeous materials, fast;
,moving action, brilliant situations,§
ideep human interest, ensembles of!
tremendous size, intrigue and pas-'
sionate love of the Far East, “One.
Arabian Night” has never been sur-
;passed. It is as a tale lifted bodily
(from the “Thousand and One Nights
performed by the
woman whom many have called the
world’s greatest screen actress, who
has the support; of a splendid com-
pany. Ernest Lubitsch, the creator of
Passion,” was the director.

When the story opens Miss Negri
is seen as the lithe and youthful
dancer in a band of traveling mounte-
banks. They enter the ancient city of
Bagdad and attract thousands of col-
orfully clad citizens as they wend
their way through narrow streets to
the central square. In the palace an
interesting event is being enacted.

DAVIS THEATER

Keith. vaudeville at the Davis

Theatre next week, beginning Monday.

afternoon, December 5, is to intro-
duce a multiplicity of stars in a va-

riety of amusing and artistic special- .

ties. It is to bring back after several
seasons’ absence, Miss Beltlc Baker, the
incomparable so-ngstress. No artiste
in the theatre today enjoys a greater
Iopularity than this brilliant and
versatile interpreter of character
songs, whom Pittsburghers have not
had the joy of seeing and h_ea—ring
during the past two seasons. Fresh

from brilliant triumphs in New York,‘

VVas‘hi.n\g'ton and Philadelphia since
her return to the stage, Miss Baker
will give a recital bf exclusive num-
bers, covering a wide range of char-
acter types and blending a -bit of
pathos with her humorous studies.
Her voice is mellow, has broadened,

and she is everywhere arousing even

greater enthusiasm than at any pre-
vious time in her career.
Miss Josephine Victor, a star from

-the legitimate theatres, is another of

the week's notable attractions. Aided
by Hart-‘ly Power and a strong sup-
porting cast, she wi-ll present a new
one act romance in four scenes by
Harry Wagstaﬂ’ Gribble. It is en-
titled “Juliet and Romeo,” and is de-
scribed as a delightful modernization
of master Will Shakespeare's master-
piece. M. Victor made her pro-
fessional debut in the production of
“Nathan Hale,” and was later with
Bertha Kalich in the “Kreutzer Son-
ata.” She has since played with Wil-
ton. Lackaye, Thomas Jeﬂ'.:son,
Maude Adams, Leo Detrichstein and
became a star in Eugene Walter’:
play, “Just a Woman." Her most
recent achievement was in the prin-
cipal role in Galsworthy’s “The Skin
Game.”

 

“Tiny” Maxwell gives Pitt the de-
cision on points—-sounds like a box-
ing bout decision.

“Jo” Thompson, one of Pitt’s" most

and proceeded to put the thought into
every A student’s heart «that Pitt‘
couldn't be licked. “Pitt teams have
been beaten, but they have never been
licked, and they never will be licked .
if you studnts back them up in ‘the
way you should.” _ . ‘I g .

“Dan” 'Kovar outlined the zlroute
which the monster parade would take
that evening. Each’, school Was. told
where to meet and like marshals, of .
-the parade were asked to draw lots
to ‘determine which -school should lead
the procession.’ “Smirtty,’f head-cheep
Ieader, was appointed as chief mar-
shal for the parade. _ l V "

iDr. Riddle gave a short talk and
wound up by leading the students in
an I“Alle_-ge-nee.” I P

All of Pitt's yells‘ were rehearsed
and the meeting closed with the sing-
ing of Alma Mater. ‘

At 7 o’clock the students from the
College began-assembling at the rear
of Alumni Hall. The “Dents” met
in ‘front of the inﬁrmary,‘ the Engi-
neers of Thaw Hall steps : and the
students from Economics School gath-
ered at State Hall. Shortly after 7
the groups got together and the, big-
gest parade ever held by_the stu‘dents
of.--the University started on its way
downtown. “Best State” signs were
to be seen everywhere. ~T.he band
was there to head the procession and
the students -had, in their possession
noise-producing implements of all va-
rieties. . ‘

You ask where all those Pitt Pep
Producers came from that were gath-
ered at the Court House on Fifth
Avenue? As if the Evening School
of Economics, Accounts and Finance
intended to be left out of showing‘
some of their true Pitt spirit.

While the students of-‘ the day school .
were enroute to the business section
of the city from the University
campus—the Evening School held‘ a
preliminary thusei at the Court house
—-just to.get in -practice for the big
demonstration that soon followed.

It’s the -old Pitt spirit that counts,
you know-whether you go to sclio’o‘l5
during the day 0:1‘ at night--and those

‘rlzwilight studes’ surely, showed that -

nothing was lacking in the Evening
School -along that line (except a sure
ﬁgnuﬁ official cheer leader)‘. .

 Besides the Evening School stu-
dents many co-eds joined the parade
at the Court. House. The stentorian
voices of the‘ men were then re-in-
forced by the thin piping yells of the
exuberant, co-eds.
tainly gave some demonstration of -
real pep. More girls than have ever
turned out before were out to fight“
for Pitt that night and help turn
back the Lions. ‘It was a treat to

turn out in such great numbers and
with such spirit. Pittsburgh’s 0

pro Mded downtown district was treated ‘

to  e . peppiestadisplay of real col-
lege spirit it has ever seen. The
busiest section of the city rang with .
Pitt" yells and cheers. Everyone as-
-sembled in front of the William Penn
Hotel and after some more \ear-sxp1it-
ting yells the parade broke up with
different groups going off by them-
selves to‘ continue the celebration. I

Kerrls Team Recognized by
Many as Greatest Cub-.
-Team in Country

 

 

seasons a Pitt Freshman football
team has ever had witha decisive vic-
-tory over Bellefonte Academy, Pitt
followers in general believe that they

have at least annexedone champion-
ship in football this year. Indeed, the
iearlings have given good account of
themselves, both as individuals and
in each of their seven
games, much of the credit for which
must be given to the hard working
coach, Andy Kerr. There is no doubt
but what “Pop” Warner will have
some excellent material to work" into
shape for the Varsity next year, as
has been the case in past years with
men who began their University foot-
ball under Kerr.

The first game of the season dem-
onstrated what a ﬁghting team the
“Panther Cubs” had when they
crushed the heavy Slippery Rock or-
nial squad by a 26 to 6 score. Then
followed an easy victory over the
West Virginia Freshmen; next the
Syracuse Freshmen were eiico-untered_,
who_ put_up the boldest front and
gave the Fresh a harde-r ﬁght for vic-
tory than any other opponent met,
either previously or later. ~ The Cor-
nell Freshmen were no match and
were far outclassed in every depart-
ment of play by the proteges of Kerr;
the Penn State Freshmen put up a re-
markable game but were unable to
penetrate. the wonderful defense pre-
sented. In the Kiski game the Fresh-
men showed that -they were the mas-
ters, and the boys from Saltsburg
were more decisively beaten than the
score would seem to indicate. Belle-.
fonte presented. a weakened team. in
their encounter here, but it is doubt-
ful whether she could have done bet- .
ter with all her regulars in, forthe‘
onslaught of the yearlings could
hardly have been stoppedexcept by 31
team much superior. In these seven
games the Freshmen scored 144;‘
points as compared to- 25 scored by,
opponents, their goal line being‘?
crossed only four times and never
twice by the same team..Games and
scores were as follows»:

Sehenley High School, proved himself
a capable leader and an excellent
player and with lg.-ewis and Carnahan,
also guards, Coach Kerr had three of
the best and largest men in College
Freshmen circles. In Bohren, the
Yearlings had a ﬁeld general in whom

ﬁdence and with him in the backﬁeld,
along with .“Ho'cts” l5‘1an8g§n at Q1131“
terback, Bruder paired with Bohren
at a half, and Johnson at fullback;
the backﬁeld was one which was
speedy and clever and wrought terror
in the ranks of its opponents. Ash-
baugh at center was -steady and is
deserving of much credit. Akms and
Murdock at tackles were powerful and

“with Frank and Gw'o‘sden on ends.

they had been playing together :0?
years instead’ of Ollll’ 3 few mom 5'
Gwosdeifs trusty right foot ‘must, be
mentioned, for the greatest victory of
the vear was won by means of it;
only two goals from touchdown were
missed thg entire season. The whole
team was strong both offeiisively and
defensively. *

enough praise can be given. for in
spite‘ of difficulties they persevered
and ‘helped in no small measure to

When one takes into consideration
the fact that on the entire Freshmen

team there were representatives of f

many prep schools with as many dif-
ferent systems 'o'f coaching, we can
realize only partly the tremendous
task which Coach Kerr assumed in
attempting to whip into shape’ a‘ win-
ning aggregation, having no nucleus
whatsoever around which he might
start to work. His success with Fresh-
men teams here at Pitt places him
on a par with the best football coaches
in the ‘country and too much credit
cannot be given him for this season's
xvorlr and the‘ ﬁne record which the
Freshmen have made. » V j _ .

The two"‘“p_ena1ties were the results of
Pitt’s being off-side twice‘-early in
game. . S   3”
Both ele-‘vans were edged sharply
for the game, but P«itt,'_everyone will

admit, was more keenly on edge,
“Pop” Warner did Snot... take his men,

tb the wilds of Saltsburg for no good

purpose. TheyS~ were taken: ther_e“i*oS

get into theibest possible condition, to

learn some additional football, and to 2

get properly tuned for the game. The
results of the trip were successful.
Pitt held scoreless a team that had

scored less than four touchdowns in‘-

only two games, in the Harvard and
Navy. tilts; in which contests they had:
scored. 21 and 13 points res-pectively.
In spite of thefact that the g'a‘méL
ended without a decision. there is
the consolation that we won a moral
victory ‘and that . we loutyelled "and?
outplayed our rivals. , S r S‘
There is ndgquestion about the
moral victory. We went into the game‘
as the under-dogs, but entered deter-
mined to keep our opponents. from;
winning. And we did succeed in keep-
ing them from winning. What more
can be expected against a team that
was an overwhelming favorite over
our team that had already lost three
games? , . S ’
Our students showed pep and ﬁght
at all’ times._ We gave to everyone
present good exhibitions of Pitt
spirit. - S ' . -
Everyone is wondering why Pitt
did not win. -It is recognized‘ by ev-
erybody that Pitt outplayed State.
The statistics of thegame prove this.
We made seven first downs «to. their
four; we gained many more yards
than they; *and we were on the of-
fensivennost of the time. The only ad-
vantage Penn ’State had over us was
in punting. ' - S
We made several drives which, it
seemed, would be stopped only after
the Blue and White goal line -been
crossed. But, in each case, Penn Stat!
managed to stop it. S ,
Once Anderson got away on an oi?
tackle play,_ eluded three of the sec-
ondary defense men, and had only
Killinger between him and the goal.
But Anderson had »not[gLot his bear-
ings yet, _.and'he» was nipped by the

terback. ‘
team outplayed the other, was played

mostly in Pitt’s_ territory, while the
second half, which was decidedly

*Pitt’s, was played mostly i.n,S,tate’s

territory. The kickoffs‘ probably made
the difference, for Pitt received the

in the second half. .

Pitt gained. more gro«und_du‘ring the
ﬁrst two ‘quarters, but they, never-
theless, were.ha'PPY when the first
half, ended. The ball "was in Penn
/State’s possession on the Pitt 23-yard
iline when the half closed, and it was
only the second down.  S ’ Q  L

It was not Penn State's superior
playing that brought them so close to

- our goal, but .a‘ rapid .succession "of.

three Sfunrbles. From the State.S -40-
yard line Killinger punted to" Davies.
Dav-Lies picked up “the treacherous
spheroid on his-.7S5-'yard line-L and re-

tackled. As he fell to the ground, the
slippery ball shot -out from him and
landed a few yards ahead of him. A

play State in turn fumbled and Kelly

was not to‘end yet. ,, Colonna, on’ the
covered. S ‘ L v
p , State was new in a scoring‘ posi-
tion. The Pitt line held, however, and
State lost the ball on downs to Pitt
on the 14-yard line, when their for-
ward pass was blocked. .
Davies immediately Spunted out of

‘S very next play, fumbled -and State re-

» danger. »Ki1linger, who caught the

‘punt on the Pitt 40-yard line, fum-

Pitt was alarmiSnglyj'cIose to‘ Penn

2 Panther Season a SllCCesslS  
   L In Spite of Three

Defea

and W.  

 Partially wiped Out by Splendid Showing Again:-.t s ,
Team ‘WasL Best in Syracuse and State Games S-

l The annual. Thanksgiving Day ~l‘3at- I end of the wages.. With  hneu: 

tle with A Penn State rang down the
curtain of a successful L season-—-suc-
Lcessful in spite of the ‘defeats ad-
ministered._ to the Panthers. The
great battle staged by the -‘Panthers
in eholdinfgv the pre-Thanksgiving
champion State;-Lteam even and Cactu-

Sally : outplaying the Mt Nittany

Lionp L wiped - the previous defeats
from’ our memories. Whatever mis-
had before
Thursday were ‘annihilated by the
great demlonstration on_Turkey Day.

The .Pa,nthers closed the season in
a blaze of glory. They accomplished
the supposedly impossible in winning
-—yes_, Lwinni,ngL in spite of the tie
score-.-;frox,_n the heralded. champions.
Pitt accomplished what no other team
had 'd*_o=ne , this seas“on—-outplaying the
Staters and. preventing them from
scoring. Harvard held ‘State even at
21-21 but Pitt went a step farther
in outplaying the Center Countians
ina no score>contest.Z Pitt, the under-
dog, on the small end of 2-1 bets, up-
set the dope with one grand smash.
The Panthers, have certainly muddled

the championship dope for» the East...

SFollowingI the custom for the last
several years, the “Panthers condi-
tioned at Camp Hamilton and en-
tered the initial fray in ﬁne mettle.
The Panthers rode rough shod over
the first victims, Geneva; 28-0. How-
ever, the victory was rather costly
in the way of injuries. The accidents
of, this game put "a serious crimp in
Pitt’s chances for the remainder of
the season. But the game demon-
strated that we had some very de-
pendable material for the season."

The following Saturday the Pan-

thers «received the first set-back of

the season when they were forced to
bow before Jock S‘utherland’s Lafay-

ette team, 6-0.’ The Eastonians L-were

barely able to push over a touchdown

and a break of fortune saved their

victory. Lafayette has gone through

the season without a defeat and is

mentioned for the title in the East.
The Panthers did not playtheir usual
-strong game, being forced’ to present

a patched-up lineup.

But Pitt cam,eSbackL strong onthe
nextone, which they annexed 21-13
over West Virginia. The. Mountain-
eers put up the best game in several
years, aided by some wonderful work
by. George Hill, in holding the Pan-
thers —as -they did. In this contest the
versatility of the Panthers’ play was
the notable feature, that augured wel
for the remaining games. S
. The ‘following Saturday Pitt nar-
rowly averted defeat at the hands-

of Cincinnati. The Panthers held the

Ohioans cheaply and barely managed
to push over at 21-14 victory. . The

stellar work of Hewittmust be noted.

He successfully retrieved the almost

departed. victory by his two succes-

sive touchdowns. However, the game
had its effect in putting the Pan-
thers in a ﬁghting mood for the Syra-
cuse game. i 

In this game the‘ Panthers fose to
a height. that was not to‘ be ap-
proached until ' the battle with State.

In defeating Syracuse 35-0 the Pa -

thers gave the greatest exhibition of
football of the-season. As in the State

game the Panthers were on the small”
