To Succeed

    Workmaster

At a meeting of Student
after-
noon Tom Ryan was elected to
succeed Stu Workmaster as
senior congress member.

Tom_ has been active in

«many activities since transfer-

ring from Kenyon College last
year. At Kenyon he was a mem-
ber of Delta Kappa Epsilon fra-
ternity. At present’Tom is presi-
dent of Stray Greeks at Pitt, and
a member of Interfraternity Coun-
cil. _

Last year the newly elected rep-
resentative was chairman of the
annual fraternity IF debate, and
also" at that time was instrument-
al‘ in organizing the Stray frater-

P nity groups.

‘Other. business. touched upon at

 the -mid-week meeting’ included a .
‘  discussionof whether all-out dem;

o_nstrati'o'ns were necessary after

each grid victory. After some com- ‘

ment by members it was decided
‘to table the matter until Dean of
Men Theodore W. Biddle could

~,-.-meet with congress next .Monday.
 President Larry Burwinkle an-

nounced the appointment of Con-
gress member Dave Fox as per-
manent social chairman to re-

Paul Brown Outof Running  

For Athleic Director Post

Paul Brown will not be consid-
ered for the vacant athletic di-
rectorship here. The general man-

ager-head coach of the profes-

sional Cleveland Browns, report-
edly dissatisﬁed there, had been
linked with the Pitt vacancy.

There was no explanation or
qualiﬁcation by the authoritative
source of this information.

It is believed, however, that
Brown would desire a combina-
tion post of director-head ‘football
coach, and that his salary de-
mands would exceed the present
Pitt level.

The salary question is especial-

ly significant, in View of three‘

things: needed Stadium repairs,

Stadium bond interest, and_ the‘

small crowds at all but the Notre

-Dame game.

Furthermore, Brown might have
wanted more dictatoria.’ control

than present policy allows the’ ‘

athletic director.

Most recent of the many rum-
ors regarding the‘. successor- to
James (Whitey) Hagan is that all
those who formally ‘applied for
theijob have-been eliminated from
consideration. , _

If ‘true, this should not cause
too much eyebrow-lifting. Of

nearly 50 applications _received
from. all‘ parts of 1 the United

States, many are from lesser lights
who ﬁgure that there is nothing
to lose by applying, even if they
are not qualiﬁed.

Frank Carver, athletic publicist
during the Hagan regime, has

been interim director since July
1 of this year. Carver, however,
has eliminated himself from any
«consideration for the position with
a statement of ‘negative interest.

Hagan was reported by The
Sporting News in line for a man-
agerial post in the New York
Yankee baseball chain. It is_ pre-

~ sumed that the job is an admin-

istrative position as general man-
ager of a farm club.

A University source discredit-
ed this report, however.

With the selection hanging ﬁre,
the Athletic Committee has not
met for over ﬁve weeks.‘ However,
one Committee member said that
there “was a good reason” when
interrogated. ‘

What this means opens the way
for more speculation. One ob-
server believes that a sub—com-
mittee or representative of the
eight—man Committee may be car-
rying out negotiations with a pos-
sible nominee for the vacant di-
rectorship.

tion designed to help_private Ne-
gro schools and their students
through ﬁnancial difficulties.
William, E. Cotter, national
chairman of the fund states that
“It is most heartening to receive

the gifts of other college stu-

dents,” and adds “We realize that
the need for education does not
have to be ‘sold’ to college stu-
dents. Therefore, the presentation
of the case of the fund to the

University of Pittsburgh is simply.

a question of giving the other fel-
low an opportunity for education
so that he can serve his people
and the nation as a whole.”

The U.N.C.F. is one ofthe sev-
en organizations, in addition to

' the, 92 Community Chest groups,

aided by the Pitt Chest Drive.

CARE, Men’s Loan Fund, ,Wom-
en’s Loan Fund, Pitt-in-China,
W.S.S.F., and the Chest Reserve
make up the other six organiza-
tions.

Abby Clark, chairman of the
drive emphasizes that “Instead of
having seven or eight separate
campaigns, we have combined
them all into one. Students should
keep this in mind and give as
generously as) possible. We are
hoping for an average contribu-
tion of $2 per person.” ’

Dorm Opening

V Extensive and unplanned reno-_

Biddle, dean of men, explains why

DeSoto Hall did not begin housing"

Pitt men on Oct. 15 as originally
announced.

‘ By Dec. 1, says Mr. Biddle, iris

hoped that plumbing, heating, and.

electrical improvements will «have
been completed and the Hall ready
to open. Along with new furni-
ture and other equipment the
renovations are expected to make

Pitt’s ﬁrst dormitory a comfortable
"if not deluxe place in which to

live.”

DeSoto Hall is the former Pal-
mer Hotel on the ‘corner of Fifth
Avenue and DeSoto Street. Under
the supervision of Dean Biddle, it
will provide 50 low-cost,_ single
and double rooms for men stu-
dents. Announcement concerning
applications for rooms will be
made in a few weeks.

ALMOST LIKE OLD TIMES.

Quite a few wolves (both inside and outside the University)
who have bee11 howling for the not-too-well-cultivated scalp of
Head Football coach Mike Milligan must have received a rather
nasty shock last week at a couple of headlines that appeared in
the downtown papers.

One said, “Mike Miligan Named Coach of the Week.”
The other read, “Pitt Rated Fourth in East.”

Not so long ago—just after the Notre Dame, in fa'ct—the
gloomy prophets. were forecasting ‘another disastrous season
for‘ the Panthers. And a good many people said openly that
Mike was on his _way out.

But all that has changed in three weeks. With the team
winning regularly and the boys showing constant, if not spec-
tacular, improvement, the two" defeats that opened the year
and the debacle of last season have been forgotten.

We ’d like to believe, as the downtown scribes are report-s

ing, that Pitt has reached the end of the comeback road. But‘
.-that ‘goal is still far in the future. We’re sure Mike and the

boys know that, too. ,

But the last fewpweeks have certainly started us onthe
way. For putting us on the right road as well as for the recog-
nition they themselves have. received both Mike and the team

deserve a big hand. They’ve.worked hard and overcome a lot

of handicaps and discouragements to bring winning football
back to the University. \ _-- ._

Right now it looks as though they’ve_ done a lot better
than anyone ﬁgured they would. ‘

BEHAVIOR GOOD—BliDDLE

To the Student Body,
via Editor, Pitt News: "

On Monday morning at the Victory Celebration in Memorial
Hall I asked that you be considerate in your celebrating and
not be destructive of property. I asked speciﬁcally “that you
not celebrate your victory at the expense of others.”

I know something of your activities on Monday for I was
with you for most of the morning. I saw little to criticize.
I am also pleased to say that thus far we have received no
serious complaints of your activities anywhere. ‘

To my mind, you—the student body—have done your part.
By staying within bounds and not celebrating at the expense
of others you have proved that great Pitt football victories

. can be pleasant events for all concerned.

A sincere thank you for the right Pitt spirit.

Carnegie Tech, for all of its
pretended learning and general
artistic nature, is composed of
selﬁsh, ignorant products of its
system. After very little. research
it is not a difﬁcult task to label
the lads of plaid thusly. Two years
running we have Victoriously
marched up Forbes and freed the
Tech students from~ the rigors of

i a day in class. WE have loosed

them for a total of 16 hours from
the stilted, cultured mouthings to
which they are exposed.

But do you think that these
peasant riﬁ and raif would re-
turn the favor? When you do a
favor for a man the least the ig-
norant could do would be tosay,
“thanks.” I realize that the pos-
sibility of Tech ever .winning a
game is just about as remote as

Africa but still I think it ﬁtting

and proper on their part to just
sort of drop around some Monday
morning at’ about 8:30 and say,
“Thanks.” '

I have no idea what excuse they

could use for a little victory-gait- '
ed march down the Street of '

Forbes but it would be the man-
nerly thing to do. If memory
serves me correctly it has been a
very long time since the kids of
Car have made ten ﬁrst downs in
a tussle of crash and mangle. But
‘any old excuse‘ will do; surely a
school schooledin the niceties of
civilization will feel honor bound
to satisfy this demand of etiquette.
We will beexpecting you, dear
old Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology. -

On Coffee Price

.I see that for all of my passion-
ate pleadings -‘and derogatory de-
nouncements ‘ on the subject the
price of coffee remains the same,
eight cents per. I take this oppor-
tunity to say to the Tuck Shop
tycoons, “BAI-IHH.” And the same
goes for your coffee. I read a small
insert in this newspaper a couple
of weeks ago that the Students
‘here atithe University are being
served a special brand of coffee,
named after’ our own glorious
alma mater.

This distinctive bean is called
“Thespecial Pitt Blend.’ The cof-
fee tastes exactly as itsvname im-
plies, straight from the pit; Per-
sonally, I would just as soon drink
a cheaper brand of coffee, if that’s
possible, because in my present
ulcerated condition, acid would be
as welcome.

Once again I say, “Garbage to
Student Congress for white-wash-
ing this capitalistic plan‘ of big
business- which makes my pants

burden of superﬂuous pennies.”
But as I understand it, the Gar-
ment Workers of America are be-
hind the whole affair.— It seems
that the pants pocket repair busi-

. ness has jumped 63 percent here

in Pittsburgh.

These ﬁndings prove. that the
Tuck Shop managers are only lit-
tle people in the workings of a
gigantic machine. So, fellow stu-
dents, don’t be too mad at Tuck
Shop prices; we" must remember
that it is being run by little peo-
ple, very little people.

On The Panther

The PANTHER is out Monday.
This is the oﬁflcial magazine here
at the U. of P. Last week, there
was a big old college newspaper
convention in Columbus, Ohio. It
was apparent from the general
conversation at this Ohio conven-
tion that a goodly portion of the
country wondered how it was pos-
sible for little college boys to print
such ﬁlth and not be run out of
town on a rail.

  Music Notes

By JERRY NEWBERG

. leases.

This month an extensive advertising campaign for the new—
Columbia long playing record (LP) has been hitting simulta-.
neously all over the nation. These remarkable records, contain- a
ing up to 45 minutes of music on a 12-inch disc, with their a?

rich and glowing clarity of reproduction, have won the unre-

served praise of critics and public alike. The silent surfaces of‘

the nonbreakable Vinylite discs, the elimination of storage

and replacement problems and the amazingly low cost‘ join-

with the superb quality of the reproduction in producing ‘a
record unequalled in listening pleasure.

Of course there ’s one catch-—you need a long play phono

attachment. Most of the new radio-phono models are equipped

with both the standard and new long play phoho unit. How-

‘ever if you don’t want to get a new phone you can resort to

a special player which can easily be attached to any radio, or
radio-phono combination.‘

Because these LP records can’t be played on regular
phone units their popularity will be retarded until these
new units’ become standardized. Another. disadvantage of
the LP record is that some of the selections onthe record
may not be appealing and in order to ehminate those tunes
you do not wish to hear it would be necessary to operate the
record player manually, therefore. defeating one of the
outstanding features of the LP records. This applies to
popular tunes in general. As for symphony and Broadway
musical scores the LP records can’t be beat.

Prohibitionists

At last! ~On Monday the Pan-

date number one is Charlie, ele-
vator operator extraordinary, who
will be President and head of Vet-

eran’s Housing. John Morrissey
has been selected as vice presi-
dent and will also be Church Sup-
per and Sunday School Recrea-
tional Coordinator.

Rege Cordic will be _Governor
and Chief F.I.B. Under Covers
Man. In Monday’s issue of the
Panther there will be ~-a detailed

account of these candidates’ p'ast,,

present and very improbable fu-
ture.

In addition, there will be the
usual Panther Overseas Page. This
page will contain news of vital
interest to Panther readers in
Russia and communistic— sympa-
thizers of other localities. Another
feature will be the new Queen of
Hearts as well as the very latest
in women’s autumn out-door
wear. 1’

As Players OpenSeason

Measuring up to a long-run
Broadway show and an Academy

_ Award motion picture is a pret-

ty big order for any college the-
ater group, but Pitt Players come
close to doing just that in their
current production of “The Phil-
adelphia Story.”

The play opened last night in
Foster Memorial Hall and con-
tinues tonight and tomorrow at
8:30 ,p. m. The ﬁrst Players list-
ing of a four—show season, the
‘Story’ as given by Harvey Pope’s
dramats should be a ﬁne indica-
tion of a dramatic season Pitt the-
ater-goers won’t want to miss.

As usual, Martha Morrison
came through with an outstand-
ing performance, this time as
Tracy Lord, a confused, some-
what spoiled Philadelphia social-
ite. Divorced from C. K. Dexter
Haven, a Main Line playboy, Tra-
cy is about to marry George Kit-
tredge, a Frank Merriwell sort of
character who has risen from a
coal—miner to owner of a gigantic
mining corporation. ‘

The day before the wedding,
Haven, ‘ably portrayed by Gene
Bartolacci, shows up and punc-
tures his ex-wife’s inﬂated ego,
making her wonder whether her
impending marriage won’t be as
much of a, mistake as her ﬁrst.
This sets the scene for magazine-
writer Mike Connor, who gets‘
Tracy drunk, takes her for an
early morning swim, and deliv-

ers her to her room ‘in a blanket.
Played by Mel Silver, Connor is
a sensitive writer who hides his
true nature under a false, wise-
‘cracking exterior. It is he who

ﬁnally sets Tracy on her feet in.

an hilarious, yet touching, cli-
max. '

As Dinah, Tracy’s teen-age sis-
ter, Anatilie Gefsky does some
scene-stealing with a littlehelp
from Cecelia Boodman, portray-
ing Connor’s photographer side-
kick, Liz Imbrie. Bartolacci, as
Dexter Haven, starts off slowly,
but turns in an excellent per-
formance, as does C. Worthington
Fowler II, who makes a first-rate
characterization of a second-rate

part as Sandy'Lord, Tracy’s broth-
er. .

The Clevelanders’ aerial attack represents their most po-

tent threat in tomorrow ’s game.

That is where Botti, a reserve

quarterback on the Pittsquad, comes on stage.

In a role that changes from

Week to Week, the Connellsville

passer this week emulated Red‘
Cat throwers Adrian Castilla and
James Mahon.‘Both are quarter-
backs. —

Since the middle of September,
Botti has thrown the passes of
Doak Walker, Frank Tripucka,
Bill Hickey, Jimmy Walthall, and
Nick Sebek from Monday through
Friday. 

Yost Moves Up

Injuries to Guard Bernie Bar-
kouskie and Center Don“ Fisher
have advanced Chuck Yost and
Len Radnor to the starting lineup
tomorrow. Radnor was the regu-
lar pivot last fall" and sophomore
Yost has been impressive in games
and practice scrimmages.

Thirty-seven men will leave to-
day for Cleveland. Making the
trip are Ends Skladany, Gerem'-
sky, McPeak, ~DeRosa, Sumpter,
and .Samer, Tackles Bolkovac,
Mihm, Plotz, Coleman, F. Thomas,
Green, and Forsythe, Guards Bar-

kouskie, Yost, C. Thomas, Boldin,
Kisiday, and Pierce, and Centers
Radnor, Steingraber, and Radose-
vich. ,

"Also on the travelling squad are
Quarterbacks Mel_illo, Cummins,
and Fuderich, Left Halfbacks Cec-
coni, Lauro, Lee, and O’Bara,
Right Halfbacks Robinson, Abra-
ham, Smodic, Hardisty,__ and Rad-
er, and Fullbacks Becker, De-
Pasqua, and Cherol. \

ern Reserve has Coa‘ch-of-the-

But even conservative Howard
Waite, veteran Pitt trainer, an-
ticipates a lop—sided victory.

Only four times in the past ten
years have the Pitts exceeded 30
points in one game. In ’43, Tech
succumbed, 45-6. Bethany wal-
lowed, 50-13, in ’44. The next
year Bucknell was drubbed, 38-0,
and in ’46, West Virginia fell, 33-7.

“I’ll meet you at 2 p. m. Tuesday one mile from Stoops Ferry
on the side of a hill,’’ proclaims D. Leet Shields, instructor in In-
dustrial Engineering, and his students in “Production Planning” are
off on their semesterly invasion of the Homestead Valve Company
at Coraopolis, armed with pencils, note paper, and an inexhaustible

stock of questions.

The inquiring visit is made at a point in the course where the

novice planners have become tem-6

porarily bogged down with pro-
duction problems.

W'ith only a few blue-prints and
samples of the ﬁnished product as
guides, the engineers begin setting
up a theoretical cast iron valve
plant. As the work progresses,
they consult textbooks, various
references, and advertising litera-
ture from plants in operation. At
the end of the semester, each stu-
dent has completed a plan in his
workbook.

In making his plan, the student
is faced with numerous considera-
tions. He must calculate a com-
plete list of equipment, including

the number of furnaces and lathes
required in the process. He must
determine the number of e1n—
ployes and work turns needed to
man the equipment beside esti-
mating the necessary floor area.
The purpose of I.E. 3, “Produc-
tion Planning” according to Mr.

Shields is “to show by practice just

what is involved in planning the
production of a speciﬁc item.”

A recent phone call from a
graduate engineer "employed in a
local plant bore out Mr. Shields’
faith in the practical value of the
course. “I do nothing but IE. 3,”
quoted the grad.

Meta! Gets

Installation of a new torsion
machine for the testing of the
strength of metals was announced
this week by Professor James B.
McDonald.

Professor‘ McDonald stated that,
“Primarily the purpose of the ma-
chine is to measure the yield point
and alternately the strength of a
metal bar.”

Placing a metal bar into the
machine, so that each end of the
bar was gripped tightly by clamps,
Professor McDonald demonstrated
how the torsion machine worked.
He stated that the machine would
hold one end of the bar and twist
the other end around until the
bar broke. The machine would

then measure the tension in inch-
pounds and the angle of twist in
degrees.

“The maximum load of the ma-
chine is 120,0‘O0 inch-pounds. It

will test a rod from about 6 inches
to’ 5 feet in length, and is power-
ed by a 3 h. p. motor.
