2000 Get Chest X-Ray;
Unit Held Over For '
Another Day.

Pitt students will have another day to get their free
TB chest X-Rays, according to Dr. H. C. Carlson, head of
Men’s Health Service. Because of exceptional student re-

sponse to the survey, arrangements were made late Wed-
nesday evening to hold the
equipment over until this after-
noon.

Almost 2000 students had tak-
en advantage of the X-Ray pro-
gram when the equipment clos-
ed down at 4 p.m. yesterday. An
average of 500 students a day
took the test at the survey sta-
tion located in G 47 Cl. on the
ground floor near the Student
Desk.

The X-Ray equipment will be
operating today on the same
schedule followed during the
week: from 9 a.m. to 12 noon and
from 1 to 4 p.m. The X-Ray
only takes 12 seconds.

Student Congress, which is
sponsoring the survey, expressed

bers take advantage of the tests.”
Only a handful of Pitt instructors
and administrators had taken the
X-Ray by last night.

Spring Prc.-?Reigis‘tration.

Red tape, will return to spring semester registration "in February when the Uni-
versity discontinues its policy of pre—registration. Students will no longer be able to pick
up class cards for the second semester of a two semester courseas they have in the past.

The ruling means that students will follow the identical process they underwent
in September. In the .past many students were able to skirt the class card line alto-
gether.

According to E.'A. Batchelder, the move was made because many of the students»

who picked up the second semester cards failed to take the course. He said some of

thesepeople did not return the cards, thus leaving vacancies which could have been .

ﬁlled.

He also pointed out that some students failed the first semester courses and drop-

Tratner, who said he was “under the impression that Freshman Council is under .

he had no business there."

The fact that Men’s Council’s constitution denies attendance to their meetings by

Controversial Loyalty Oath Bill
C  mes Up for Third Round Tuesday

The battle lines appear clearly drawn in the ﬁght over the Pechan “Loyalty” Bill,
now up for its third reading in Harrisburg before the House, Tuesday.

The controversial act, passed by the State Senate in April, has been revised by
a House committee. The original bill called for oaths from employees of state supported
institutions (Pitt gets state money). As the proposed act now stands, teachers in the col-
leges‘ are exempted from the oath although public school teachers and state officials
would be subject to it.

Instead, college presidents must report yearly on steps b ing taken to keep “sub-
versive persons” off the faculties. No concrete standards of logalty and subversion are
given the act. c ‘ '-

Boys Traveled Halfway Around
World "Before Meeting Here

By LEO MOSS

In 1939 two boys, Fred Tausig and Werner Feig ﬂed
their homes in Vienna to escape persecution. In Shanghai
they met and went to school together.

After the war they again separated and each traveled
halfway around the world in different directions.
months ago they met by accident in a fraternity house at

Pitt.

Werner lived in Breslow, Germany, before the war.
He was only six years old in 1939 when his father was
taken to Buchenwald. The Nazis offered to release him if
his family could show proof of a way to get out of Europe.

A Diﬂicult Decision

It was a tough problem. Australia offered to take them
in if they renounced their Jewish religion. They refused,
and the only other choice was Shanghai, China, then the

“hell—ho1e” of the East.

The Feigs chose Shanghai and found it bad, but not as

bad as the stories.

Fred Tausig was seven when he left his home in Vienna.

The same decision lay with

Shanghai, hoping that things thereé

were not as bad as they heard.

The two boys grew up in
Shanghai. They went to school
together under a Senior Cam-
bridge School Certiﬁcate.

Back to Vienna

Fred ﬁnished high school and,
after the war, went back to Vien-
na. He was ﬁfteen years old when
he enrolled in the University of
Technology.

After he graduated, he applied
to the World Students Service
Fund, an organization that brings
refugee students to America.
Luckily a Pitt fraternity offered
him sponsorship, and he left for
America to do graduate work in

Loyalty Oath Bill Up
For Third Time in House

(Continued from Page 1)

University Professors, commented
that:

“The members of the Pitt chap-
ter of AAUP are solidly opposed
to the Pechan Bill. This opposition
is in line with the policy of the
national group . . . The AAUP is
the recognized spokesmen for the
University teaching profession on
questions of academic freedom.”
Dr. Laufer also told the News
that: ‘

1. Professor Putman Jones,
chairman of the Committee on
Academic freedom, is going to
Harrisburg on Dec. 11 to co-
operate with other groups
against the bill.

2. Professor Francis Tyson and
William Tacey are trying to
secure an appointment with
Gov. Fine later next week to
e x p l a i n the Association’s
stand.

3. The local AAUP chapter is
sponsoring letters, urging op-
position, to individual mem-
bers of the House signed by
substantial numbers of Uni-
versity people residing in the
respective member’s district.

Chief backers of the measure
have been the American Legion
and other veteran groups. The
Pittsburgh Press has been sym-
pathetic to the loyalty proposal
while the Post Gazette has fought

the act vigorously.

- Backers of so called Loyalty
legislation have generally ex-
pressed an “If you’re loyal, what
are you worried about?” attitude.
Opponents have alleged such leg-
islation to be dangerous in a free
society.

The American Association of
University Professors asserted, for
instance, that loyalty legislation
tended to “. . . sap the strength
of American education, American
thought, and American institutions
by requiring conformity to official
orthodoxy of -opinion and con-
duct.”

Backers of “Oath legislation”
deny this to be the case.

Regardless of the merits of the
arguments, it appears that the
Pechan Bill will pass in any vote
before the House or Senate. If it
is to be defeated, it must be kill-
ed in committee.

As one prominent University of-
ﬁcial put it, “If anyone votes
against the bill in a record vote,
he runs the risk of being called a
Communist.”

WHAT’S SO DIFFERENT
ABOUT ENGLEWOOD, N. J.?

In Englewood, the local telephone exchange looks pretty much
like the telephone building in any other town.

And EngIewood’s telephones seem just the same as the twenty-
seven million other dial telephones in the country.

But there’s a difference . . .

You can pick up a telephone in Englewood and dial San Francisco
telephone numbers direct!

In fact, you can dial any one of eleven million telephone numbers
in thirteen widely scattered areas from coast to coast.

That’s what makes Englewood different — the new kind of Long
Distance telephone service on trial there by the Bell System.

Long Distance dialing is another example of the Bell System’s
constant search for ways to provide you with ever-better telephone

service.

Pint-sized quarterback Jack Hackett of Miami
and Pitt’s Bobby Bestwick show off their talents
tonight when the Panthers conclude their 1951
grid season against the Hurricanes in the spacious
Orange Bowl.

Both Pitt and Miami coaches ﬂatter their re-
spective T generals as the ﬁnest passers in their
schools’ history. It will be interesting to see who
outheaves who.

Grady’s Fins Hopeful  

Of Banner Season

By RUSSELL FRANKE
All things point to a banner
the coming season.

“This is the strongest team we have ever had,” is the

word from Coach Ben Grady, whoé
has been putting the boys through
drills at the Trees Gym and

Coach Grady bases his belief on
both team balance and previous
accomplishments of his individual

year for Pitt swimming in

cl Tonight”

after their third straight grid win of the season.

Hackett, 152-pound senior from McKeesport,
owns more passing records than any other gridder
in Miami’s history. Everytime he throws the pig-
skin his passing marks are buried deeper into the
books.

Pitched ’Canes to Win Last Year

The “Hatchet-man”
for: most passes completed, most yards gained by
passing, most passes thrown, and touchdown
passes thrown.

In a game played with the'University of Flori-
da recently Hackett’s passing gained 226 yards—a
new record for a single game.

All this was accomplished over three years in
which time Hackett missed nine complete games
because of injuries. .

Last year at the Stadiugn Hacket pitched 16
complete passes for 26 attempts to lead the ’Canes
to a 28-0 win in the ﬁrst intersectional clash be-
tween the two schools.

Bobby, Chris in Last Games

Miami will be watching a different Bestwick
tonight than the Bestwick they saw last year.

The 174-pound senior from Shaler Twp. has
been recognized in Eastern football circles this
year as one of the ﬁnest passers in the section.
In fact, Bobby, who has completed 94 of 167 pass-
es, ranks second in the East completing 56% of
his throws.

Bestwick has set nine all-time Pitt records and
could enter three more into the books in his
ﬁnal collegiate game tonight.

Chris Warriner, Bestwick’s favorite receiver,
also will be out to further his record—bustin’ feats.
Chris, a senior from Tarentum, has set six all-
time records and could add two more beside his
name. \

Campbell, Cimarolli To Start

Coach Tom Hamilton, who once again becomes
Athletic Director Hamilton after tonight’s ﬁnale,
has revised the backﬁeld combination.

Jim Campbell, 190-pound senior, will operate
from right half as the power-man in the Pitt
backﬁeld. Campbell has been the leading ground
gainer since being installed into the lineup during
the second half of the Ohio State game.

He is the only Panther to score two TD’s in a
single game this year.

Lou Cimarolli, 165-pound sophomore from
Bridgeville, is slated to return to his left half
post. Billy Reynolds, junior back, will play both
offense and defense spelling Cimarolli on offense.

Pitt’s frosh basketball team,
1951 edition, will be unveiled
on Tuesday, Dec. 11 when
they lift the lid on the winter
sports campaign at Washington
and Jefferson.

The Frosh quintet is hopeful of
picking up where their prede-
cessors of 1950 ﬁnished on a three-
game winning streak. Last sea-
son’s yearling ﬁve closed with a
70-51 triumph over State’s Nittany
Lions to post an impressive 10 and
3 chart.

A new hand will guide the for-
tunes of the Panther Cubs, as for-
mer Coach Bob Artman has been
replaced by another former “ice
cream eater”, Dodo Canterna, who
starred for the Blue-and-Gold in
the ’47 and ’48 campaigns.

Nine members of last year’s

frosh dribblers are now playing on
Doc Carlson’s varsity including
pacesetters Dutch Burch, Alex
Novakovich and Bob Brown.

The new Panther basketeers,
although untried, do present a

favorable array of talent, at least ‘

on paper.

Currently running with the ﬁrst
ﬁve are two All-State Catholic
high school nominees, Ed Pavlick
and Joe Resetuk, who made up a
formidable one-two punch for

Who says Pitt doesn’t have winning football?

There is one student at Pitt who would defy anyone
to say that he hasn’t been playing winning football right
here in the Intramural football setup. He's Bobby Wicks,
a halfback on this year’s All-City IM champions, the Psi

. Omega dental fraternity.

" The slim, l40—pound Psi Omega star has set an amazing
record in IM football since he en-6
rolled as an undergraduate in 1945. '

For Bobby has played in 53 games
since then.

52-Game Winner

Now, there is nothing spectacu-
lar about this, but when it com
down to win
ning 52 of these
53 games, it’s
ditferent story.

And that is
inst what Wicks 5
has accomplish

 

 

 

 

three years h
h a s displayed
his talents with
t h e Psi O’s,
w h i c h h a v e
amassed a 30-game winning skein.

Lost to PiKA’s

Before this he played for the
Locals, an independent team which
won the All-Campus champion-
ship in 1948. This outﬁt lost to the
Tech champs, but fortunately for
Wicks’ record he missed the game
because of a torn ligament.

This was the only IM contest
which the 24-year-old Dent
student missed in the ﬁve years
that he has been playing I
football. ‘

In 1947 the Locals were unde-
feated going into the IM cham-
pionships, when the PiKA’s nosed
them out of the running in the
elimination series, 7-2. This ‘tilt
marked the ﬁrst and only time that
the ‘reversal’ was put on a club on
which Wicks was a member.

He’s IM’s Outstanding Player

anon where he played regular

 

Wicks

IM All-Star Team

Wicks Most Valuable

Fraternities continued to dominate the campus all—star
team, but it was the independents who came away with the

A
V

individual honors.

Bobby Wicks, the Psi Omega's
‘all everything’, was the unanimous
choice for outstanding back and
Pitt intramural player of the year.
The Castoff’s Gil Bucci was
awarded the outstanding lineman
after a close race with Don Clark
of Sigma Chi.

Three Sigma Chi’s

Of the two teams selected the’

fraternities placed eight men.
Sigma Chi, fraternity champs, led
the frat choices with three men,
two on the ﬁrst team. The Castoﬁs
and the Psi O’s made up the inde-
pendent selections, each gaining
two positions.

The choice of Wicks as out-
standing player of ’5l marks a per-
fect ending to one of the best
players in Pitt intramural football
history. Wicks was chosen to the
all—star team in 1948, and in 1949
as a ﬁrst team back. In 1948, as a
member of the campus champion
Locals, he’was also chosen as the
player of the year. No such award
was offered in ’49 and no all-star
team was chosen in 1950.

halfback for two years, is deﬁ-
nitely the outstanding IM football
player this year.

When commenting on his
playing this year, Wicks mod-
estly says, “George Walk was
our best ball player.” Yet the
[M sports writers picked him as
a. ﬁrst team member of their
All-Star team. .

In 1948 and 1949 he was also
honored as being an All-Star. Last
year he didn't make it because the
big snow was the chief worry of

the IM department and no All-,
Star team was picked. i

“A Perfect Gentleman” ,
Leo C. Bemis, IM Director, calls ,
Wicks “a perfect gentleman on and 
off the ﬁeld.” Dave Devey, Sigma|
Chi’s ace passer and a member of i
this year’s All-Star team, sums up i
Wicks’ ability in three words— 3
“He’s some player.” 3
The fourth year dentstudent. §
although only 140-pounds, did I"
have designs on playing for the 2
Varsity. He says, “I was too I
light for the single wing when I
ﬁrst came here, but when the T
was installed, the only thing that
kept me from trying out was my
heavy dent schedule.”

There are probably a lot of guys
who wished Bobby would have
taken one of these snap courses
that the University has, so that he
would have never donned a Local
and a Psi Omega uniform. .

Yes, Wicks has some story to
tell. It’s amazing and hard to be-
lieve but Bemis will vouch on the
football record of 140-pound
Wicks, who wears glasses as he
passes because he can’t see his re-
ceivers without them.

Bucci Best Lineman

Gil Bucci, the lineman of the
year,’was one of the chief reasons
for the Castoﬁs successful climb
into the ﬁnals and championship

DTD Wins “B” Opener;

Arnold

Downs YMCA

By JACK DAVEY

Delta Tau Delta opened their season with a one-sided
victory over Phi Epsilon Pi, 37-19, in its ﬁrst “B” game of

the year, Wednesday night at Trees Gym.

Art Mcsorley was the big gun
for the Delts as he poured four
ﬁeld goals and three free throws
through the net for an eleven
point total. George Aitcheson fol-
lowed up with seven more al-
though hampered with a weak left
hand which was broken during IF
football season.

Jimmy Silverman tapped in
eight points for the Phi Eps and
was a consistent standout on de-
fense along with Buzzy Mayer.

The game was tied at 17-all
with only four minutes left when
the Delts suddenly caught ﬁre and
dumped in 20 points while the best
the Phi Eps could do was a pair
of fouls.

It was the ﬁrst defeat of the
season for the Phi Eps while the
Delts maintained their perfect
record in “A” and “B” leagues.

IM Director Leo Bemis an-
nounced that all games scheduled

for today have been cancelled, but _

IM action will resume Monday.

Noah’s Ark, which delivered civilization from drowning,
has a modern counterpart in ARK, which will deliver
Korean refugees from the bitter winter of that war-torn

success.”

Student Congress recently ap-
pointed a committee to head the
drive. In charge of organization

Need Warm Clothes

Mrs. Batz said there is a par-
ticular, need for warm clothing of
any shade. “Koreans prefer dull
colors but would wear a bright red
coat to keep out the penetrating
cold.”

ARK was formed when ten or-
ganizations of the American Coun-
cil of Volunteer Agencies for For-
eign Service, Inc., combined
through the co-operation of the
U. S. State Department under the
chairmanship of Douglas Fair-
banks.

LEADING LADY Sue Delphey has been cast in the leading role
of “Oedipus Rex.” In Greek tradition, she is wearing a “chiton”

Oedipus’s wife and mother. (Photo by Gorby).

Players Will Use Authentic » 

Greek Costumes

For the last few weeks,
been delving
Greek history to discover just how
the ancients dressed duringthe
ﬁfth century B.C.

Contrary to common belief, the
Greeks did not wear white. They
went in for rich combinations of

cotton, and some silk or satin.

Heavy Material Not Used
Heavier materials like velvet
and brocades were not used be-
cause of the heat in their Mediter-
ranean country.

According to Miss Theresa Mra-
vintz, wardrobe mistress, all the
costumes, for “Oedipus Rex” are
being made by members of Play-
ers. “We are trying to make them
as authentic as possible,” she said.

Following the Greek tradition,
all the royal family and the
wealthier characters will be
dressed in chitons —- long tunics
which reach the ankles—~covered
with a short cloak. Commoners,
like the messenger and the herds-
man, will wear short tunics.

Barefoot Players

The sandals used in the play are
being specially fashioned by hand.
It was the custom in Greece at
that time to go barefoot in the
house. Only the wealthy wore any
type of shoe, and then only in the
streets. Many of the characters in
the show, therefore, will be with-
out shoes, Miss Mravintz explain-
ed.

To stimulate the curly hair pre-
valent then, the men in “Oedipus
Rex” will undergo a session with

Class’ Aids

German Students

By DON SHARAPAN
The members of an elementary German class are tak-
ing upon themselves the job of assuring some needy college

students in Europe a merry

Christmas.

Following a suggestion by one of themembers of the

class, the students volunteered to
contribute .clothes and other mis-
cellaneous items.

.The next day eight boxes of
clothes, coffee, and other odds and
ends were collected.

The instructor, Mrs. Lore B.
Foltin, said that the articles are
being sent to universities in Ber-

‘ L lin, Vienna, and Heidelberg.

Her students, she said, wrote
letters to the president of each
school asking’ that the packages

. be_ distributed to needy students.
Mrs. Foltin pointed out that -“in '

‘Germany, just because "a person
goes to college it ‘doesn’t mean
that he’s able to afford clothes.”

Mrs. Foltin explained that all
26 of her students had a part in
the project. “I think the United
Nations’ could learn a lesson in
spirit and fellowship from the stu-
dents that contributed to this
worthwhile project,” she said.
VOne of the students, Richard
Cohen, a sophomore in the col-
lege, said, “This is a perfect ex-
ample of Christmas spirit.‘ After
it was mentioned we allithought
it was an excellent idea. ,

“Nobody told anyone else what
they brought in,.and after every-
thing was collected, we each con-
tributed a dollar for postage and

to buy some other gifts.”

C Independents To Back

(Continued from Page 1)’

T winkle said that Men’s Council
would “probably go along with
the idea.”

‘ He added that he thought “it
would be a good idea for all the
different groups to get together

‘ and discuss the proposal at its

next meeting.” 9
Student Congress head Cyril
Wecht also went along with the
T idea and said that “the matter will
be brought before Congress at the
next meeting.”
’Wecht. thought such a committee
s h o u l d discuss our University
.. problems.

Like Burwinkle, '

C Brotherhood Move

Wecht also stated that there was
“a good possibility that Congress
might take the initiative in form-
ing such a committee, providing
the PIA does not do so first.”

Alan Rueben, head of the col-

Conference of Christians and
Jews, said his group “would” be‘
glad to :=~participate.”

Women’s Self Government As-
sociation-head Nancy Tear said
the Association “would be inter-
ested in discussing the issue.”

Student leaders of the other
groups mentioned in Weinstein’s
column could not be reached for

comment.

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests

' Hysteria reigned from the moment he heard the
details offthose quick-trick cigarette mildness tests.

First he giggled . . . then he guﬁawed . . . ‘

Wound-up rolling in the aisle! He knew that the
“single sniff” test or the f‘one.. puﬁ” test didn’t
prove anything! Millions of smokers have

reached the same conclusion — there’s just one

test_that really proves cigarette ﬂavor and mildnessl

It’s the sensible test .  the 30-Day Camel
Mildness Test, which simply asks you to 
Camels as your steady smoke — on a pack-after-pack,

day-after-day basis. No snap judgments! Once

you’ve enjoyed Camels for 30 days in your “T-Zone”
(T for Throat, T for Taste), you’ll see why . . .
