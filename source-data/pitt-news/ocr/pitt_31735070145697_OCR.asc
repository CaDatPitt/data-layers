Pitt students reflect on their _flTSt snow make-'u,p day

Milton Eldridge
For The Pitt News

The classes held on the ﬁrst Saturday

snow make—up day seemed to vary in
importance.

Pitt student Pam Derck said her
philosophy professor chose to hold

class Saturday, but she felt as though ‘

the professor made the class manda-
tory without actually doing so.

“He said it wasn’t mandatory but
said we would be covering material es-
sential to the ﬁnal,” Derck said. Derck
attended the class.

Many of the missed Monday class-
es met on Saturday, while the canceled
Tluesdayaclasses will meet on.April 17.
About 70 percent of professors with
Monday classes requested rooms to

hold classes missed during Snow-
pocalypse, the historic snowstorm
that hit in February and caused Pitt to
cancel four days of classes. The Ofﬁce

of the University Registrar e-mailed‘

professors asking them to respond
by Feb. 18 if they didn’t want to re-
serve a classroom on the two make-
up days. 4

The registrar received room re-
quests for 1,062 classes out of 1,517 for

- this past Saturday and 1,159 classes

for Saturday, April 17 out of 1,590.

. Pat Wehman, who works in the
registrar’s office, said the office
wanted to know how many teachers

were not holding Saturday classes .

to determine how many classrooms
would be available. The room request
doesn’t make sure the teachers make
up missed work, it just indicates the

N o passing on Passover Seder dinners withHillel

Amy Friedenberger ’

Staff Writer

Passover Seder is traditionally an
intimate event with close family
and friends but manyjewish stu-
dents who are away from home
don’t attend Passover Seders. In-
stead of focusing on what they’re
missing —- the family connection
— the Hillel Jewish University
Center is encouraging students
to host their own Seders.

Hillel students and staff will
hold at least 18’ Seder meals
across -the city tonight and to-
morrow night.

The Hebrew word Seder
means “order” and refers to the
religious service of the same
name. Jewish followers observe
the service and meal on the‘ ﬁf-
teenth of the Hebrew month
Nisan. The Seder marks the be-
ginning of Passover, which com-
memorates the biblical event of
the Hebrews’ escape from Egypt
and runs today through April 6
this year.

The Hillel—sponsored meals
will take place in the Hillel
JUC, located on Forbes Avenue,
apartments, dormitories, frater-
nity houses and the William Pitt
Union. About 370 students are
signed up for the satellite Sed-
ers.

The Hillel JUC hosted about
100 to 150 Jewish students
from Pitt, Carnegie Mellon and
the city’s other universities last
year, said Pitt student Carly Adel-
mann, a HillelJUC intern who is
organizing the group’s Passover
program.

“Having 100 to 150 people

at a Seder is not the same as a
traditional family Seder,” Adel-
mann said. “We took the idea of
family and broke it up as a more
intimate experience.”

Hillel JUC sponsors the Sed-
ers, providing food, tables,
chairs, training and Haggadahs,
the religious text that sets out the
order of the Passover Seder.

“Hillel made it really easy for
students to host their own Sed-
ers,” said Brianna McDonough,
Jewish life chair for the Pitt Stu-
dent Board of Hillel. McDonough
will co—host her ﬁrst Seder at Hil-
lel tomorrow night.

While some of the Seders will
be traditional, a few will have
non—traditional twists, like a veg-
etarian Seder hosted by Carnegie
Mellon student Aaron Weil.

Adelmann chose to forgo the
catered food that Hillel offers
to hosts and will cook her own
meal instead. She plans to do an
around-the-world Seder in her
apartment. She will serve qui-
noa, which is a grain-like crop,
meatballs with spaghetti squash
and curry potatoes, among other
foods.

But most students will host
traditional Seders.

Pitt student Benjamin Robin-
son will hosta traditional Seder
in his Forbes-Craig apartment.
Seder dinners can last between
45 minutes and several hours.

Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority
will host a sisterhood Seder in
its suite and Zeta Beta Tau fra-
ternity will host a traditional one
in its house.

A Seder retells the story of
the escape  the Israelites from
slavery in ancient Egypt. The

host retells the story through
the Haggadah. ‘

After the Seder, a meal is
usually served. It traditionally
consists of gefilte ﬁsh, matzah
ball soup and a brisket or chicken
dish. The meal is usually up to the
discretion of the host. C

Students could sign up fora

Seder on the Hillel website and ..

choose which Seder they wanted
to attend. The deadline to sign up
was Mar. 24.

Hillel will still have its tra-
ditional Seders on the first two
nights of Passover at the Hillel

Geriatrics isn’t the ﬂashiest ﬁeld in medicine
when compared to emergency surgery or cut-
ting—edge neuroscience, but the six University
of Pittsburgh graduate students who meet inla
lofty Cathedral of Learning conference room
don’t seem to care. .

In fact, the six master’s students from Pitt’s
Graduate School of Social Work are dedicatedto
the world of geriatrics, and they are translating
that dedication into a project addressing com-
mon misconceptions of hospice ‘care.

Mara Krotec:

Students involved with the project include
Krotec,Jen Marasco, Lynnae Stern, Tami Marie
Krzeszewski,Joe Osiecki and Christopher Mess-
ersmith. Most of their work to-date consisted
of interviews with medical professionals and
condu_cting statistical analysis.

They operate under a series of grants from
the Hartford Partnership Program for Aging
Education and receive regular oversight from
Beth Mulvaney, a social work ﬁeld adviser at

‘Pitt. . .

sician’s referral to hospice as a death sentence
—— as the en 3’, » , ‘

The goal of their project, which the students
developed independently from professors and

advisers, is not to raise the number of hospice ,

referrals but to increase public awareness about
whathospice care entails.

Entering a hospice is a constructive pallia-
tive decision, which shifts the emphasisaway
from developing a cure toward the management
of symptoms. Hospices are typically recom-
mended for patients with a prognosis of less
than six months, or whena physician decides

T active and aggressive treatmentwill do nothing-
but hasten a patient’s death.

dents over the -past several months, Mulvaney
said; These include ﬁeld instructors, directors,
administrators and local community members
from within the Hartford Partnership.

The decision to enter a hospice is usually
made after a recommendation by the primary
physician, which is why the students’ project is
primarily targeting professionals in the medi-
cal community. Currently the average stay in
a.hospice is only 12 days, in spite of the fact
that hospice beneﬁts are available for up to six
months. P '

“We are pusliingto startthe hospice conver-
sation with doctors and other professionals,”
Osiecki said. “The more we talk about-hospice
care, the more beneﬁt patients will be able to
get out of it. Ifwe can raise the average hospice

Pitt could maintain its usual number ofMondays

up Wednesday classes because the University has
its usualnumber ofwednesday classes even with
the one missed in February, Heron said.
“These Saturdays were chosen because they
had the least amount of classes and scheduled
events,” Heron said referring to March 27 and
April 17. Heron said she is not aware of any re-
percussions for professors who chose not to
make up their classes. ‘

Arlen did not attend the Saturday class.
Arlen also has a professor who chose to

minutes to make up for lost time. Arlen said‘
the class voted for this option over holding a

John Twyning, chair of the English Depart-

any other class cancellation.

“There is always an expectaﬁon to make up

Patrick Bertolio, like many other students,

dreads attending class the Sat11rday before ﬁnals. .

Bertolio, an engineering major at Pitt, will have
to make up his physics class on April 17.

“It’s physics. The Saturday class isn’t manda-
tory, but if you miss one day of physics you miss a

ﬁnals, the professorwill most likely be reviewing

material for the ﬁnal as well, he said.

Eric Kane of Delta Tau Delta fraternity
said he didn’t mind pretending to be Cap-
tain Hooklfor the night for their Peter Pan
themed event.

“I like Captain Hook. I’d rather be him,”
Kane said. -

Each pairing chose its own theme.

“Greeks are very excited and motivated
to win,” saidjoe Ayala, Greek Week Overall.
“Many Greeks start thinking about this in
the fall.”

The Greeks found out their pairs back in
October through a selection process based
on rankings and GPAs. Some sororities and
fraternities have held tryouts to determine
which of their members would perform in
Greek Sing. ' -

As the months passed, pairs tried to
perfect their choreography, costumes, set
design and singing. Fromjanuary until the
ﬁnal night, many pairings have held intense
practices. V

Matt Biedron, a dancer for Phi Delta
Theta fraternity, said that their practice
schedule stepped up in the past week. For
the six days before the competition, they
practiced ﬁve hours or more each day, he
said.

He still enjoyed the experience.

“It’s great to hang out and meet-these
people you are working with,”’Biedron
said.

The practice paid off for Biedron and
many of theiother greeks. All the pairs
brought laughs, cheers and whistling from
the crowd, such asﬂwhen Alpha Delta Pi
sorority, Triangle fraternity and Alpha Ep—.
silon Pi fraternity danced to Miley Cyrus’
“Party in the USA.” 

Chantz Anderson; who was part of the
Delta Chi and Sigma Sigma Sigma vampire

' He said he “wasn’t scared at all. .I did
this last year, and you can’t‘see the crowd
because it is mostly dark anyway.” i

Cominksy said she was very pleased with
the event. “It was the best Greek Singl have
ever seen. All the acts were amazing and the
talent that exists in these organizations is
something to behold,” she said.

stay to even 20 or30days, thatwould be a major
success.”

A social worker is responsible for arrang-
ing a diverse array of beneﬁts while a patient
undergoes hospice care. The beneﬁts include
easier access to medicines and other services
to improve the quality of a patient’s day—to-day
life. The social worker operates alongside nurses
and physicians to make whatever time a patient
has left as comfortable as possible.

Counseling services are also arranged for

family members and can continue even after
the patient dies.

“We live in a death-phobic society,” Mulva-
ney said. “Too many patients and physicians
see hospice referrals as a resignation to death,
as giving up too early, and so they are blinded
from the beneﬁts.” 

Through intensive hospice care and the alle-
viation of symptoms, some patients even begin
to rebound -— in which case the decision to
enter hospice can be reversed and aggressive

7

treatments can begin again.

Mulvaney was quick to point out that pa-
tients do not typically rebound after entering a
hospice, but it is importantfor patients to con-
sider the potential beneﬁts of palliative care.

“It is often difficult for patients and their
families to develop the distanced perspec-
tive needed for appropriate hospice referral,”
Marasco said. “Which is exactly why ourproject
is a vital one. We need to foster the conversa-
tion.”

Tablesturn for
primary care

The primary care physician is a rare
sighting. Sexytelevision shows are
about emergency room work and
surgeries, not regular checkups and
preventative care. It isn’-t just the
glamour that urges medical stu-
dents to gravitate toward highly
specialized ﬁelds. These special-
ties are also tagged with a high sal-

ary, and the primary care doctor is T

among the least paid.

A student makes sacriﬁces to
reach the physician’s level. Between
long education, high graduating
debt and excessively long work
hours, a physician comes a long
way by the time the letters MD or
DO can be found behind his name.
Therefore it is of no surprise or con-
cern that one following the path
would seek complementary reward
— the salary.

V The primary care ﬁeld, encom-
passing family medicine, pediatrics
and internal medicine, is not the
ﬁrst place to turn. Indeed, family

' medicine, with the lowest average

salary also had the lowest percent
of ﬁlled residency spots in 2008
— 42 percent according to Science—
Daily.com, a popular science news
website. '

But the wave of health care re-
form that passed last week forever
changed the prospects for the ﬁeld.
Under the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act, primary care

' physicians will receive increased

Medicare payments. All other ﬁelds
face a 21 percent cut in Medicare
payments from a separate bill. Ad-
ditionally, the act applies aMedicare
payroll tax for single people making
more than $200,000 or couples

r making more than $250,00_0 —

the kinds of numbers that generally
don’t apply to primary care now.
Primary care is becoming more
lucrative and will become more
popular. It has to. And this is a
change students should pay atten-
tion to. _ _ ‘ '
According to the American
Academy of Family Physicians, pri-
mary care is really the “base of the
health care workforce pyramid.”
Currently, the physician proﬁle is
only 31 percent primary care and 69
percent other specialties. This num-

ber has to increase for the health
of the nation to improve; primary
care directly affects the status of
the United States in terms of infant
mortality and overall death rates,
according to ScienceDaily.com.
Incentives to achieve this are

. sprouting. Texas Tech University’s
- Health Sciences Center School of

Medicine recently announced a
three-year degree in family medi-
cine, a primary care ﬁeld. The cur-
riculum is shorter than the tradi-
tional four years of medical school
and gives students a new reason to
enter primary care. The quality of
education stays the same, because
the fourth yearof medical school

traditionally serves to prepare'stu-

dents for specialty ﬁelds.

Additionally, the Liaison Com-
mittee on Medical Education, the
national organization that vets
many medical schools, has accred-
ited Texas Tech University’s new
program, speaking to its quality. For
perspective, this committee also ac-
credits the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine and Harvard
Medical School.

Going to medical school for
three years will cut tuition costs
for people who want to become pri-

mary care physicians. Texas Tech A
will also give a $13,000 scholarship '

to students to cover tuition and fees
for their ﬁrst year. Another medical
school also has a similar three-year
program: Lake Erie College of Os-
teopathic Medicine, in Erie, Pa., of-
fers a program to graduate primary
care physicians.

Entering this ﬁeld is becoming
more and more incentivised. The
country is responding to primary
care physician shortage on many
levels and the 31-69 ratio will in-
crease.

Surgery and emergency medi-
cine will always have that fringe of
appeal to the public. The time sen-

‘ sitive manner of the work makes it

enticing. Although these specialties
will not leave the television screen

‘ anytime soon, primary care will

comprise a greater portion of phy-
sicians. Medical students should

gear up for competition in a ﬁeld _

that was yesterday’s underdog.

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Yahoos unreasonable, not
ays the arguments

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

Although Google might be the dorr1i—
nant search engine, there is still room
for a yahoo in politics. Yahoos, not the
company but the people, infect the
body politic, whether itis those outliers
onthe Left who believe 9/11was a gov-
ernment conspiracyto send everybody
in the country to Guantanamo Bay, or
some of those on the Rightwho insist
that teaching evolution is part of a lib-
eral conspiracy to destroy religion.
Tryingtobeareasonable personin
an atmosphere of unreasonability is a
difficult task at best. A person is often
ostracized formakingsome ofthe same
arguments made by those portrayed
as wﬂd—eyed extremists, even if you
make these arguments thoughtfully.
For example, whenarguingagainst gtm
control orthe healthcarebill, Ihave had
to explain why I am not a crazy-eyed,
gun—toting crypto-Nazi paid by health
care companies to terrorize members

of Congress.

Certain arguments areautomatical—
ly seen as less credible simply because
extremists use them as talkingpoints.
Never mind that, say, columnistGeorge
W111 makes the same argument more
reasonably. This isthe logical fallacy of
the ad hominem attack —-justbecause
somebody might have extreme ideas
doesn’tmeanthatthey aren’t occasion-
ally right. Furthermore, the persontalk-
ing to you should not immediately be
dismissed as a nutcase because they
use a nutcase’s talking point.

Unfortunately, the syllogism “Point
Ais anargument made by nuts. There-
fore, everybody who says A is a nut”
carries alot ofweight. This is problem-
atic because itends debate, and because
some arguments have merit, regardless
of who makes them.

Take, for example, the anti—evo-
lution crowd. I ﬁnd them armoying.
They generally don’tunderstandwhat
the theory of evolution says, or what a
scientiﬁc theory even  The general
premise of intelligent design, as far

as I cantell, is that the universe deﬁes
explanation, so we should just sayGod
did it. Takingthis to its logical conclu-
sion, science in general is a big waste
of time.

Butas muchas I disagreewith such
conclusions, intelligent design propo-
nents have at least one good argument.

correct, and generally “critical think-

SOME UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM

Students’ wallets the immediateissue

Jacob Brown
Columnist

 

Along with the 2,7o0—page health
care bill that unfortunately made its
way through the halls of Congress last
Sunday, anotherpiece of'impoitantleg-
islation rode in on its coattails.
Underanaddendum ofthe reconcil-
iationbillthatwentthroughthe House,
the Pell Grant for college students is
set to receive a $36 billion injection,

raising its maximum payout per stu- V

dent from $5,350 this school year to
$5,550 next year, leveling at $6,000
by2017. The riderbillalso callsforend—
ingthe Federal Family EducationLoan
(FFEL) guarantee program that Sallie
Mae, among other private banks, uses
to insure student loans.

Initsplace, thefederal government
will support Stafford Loans directly
instead of through third parties like
Sallie Mae. Accordingto the indepen-
dent Congressional Budget Office, the
elimination of the FFEL program will
yieldsavingsof $61 billion overthe next
10 years.

On the surface, this all looks like
some really good lemonade to be
made from an almost $1 trillion pile
oflemons. Theﬁnalverdict upon Pitt’s
administrators.

This expansion should cut over- -

head for students, who are charged

$112 billion in student loans.

_ It’s a natural path toward consoli-
dating overspending on government
bureaucracy. However, Sallie Mae Com-
munications Ofﬁcer Patricia Christel

service fees amounting to $134 more

per $3,000 loan through FFEL lend- V

ers than private lenders, according to
aJanuary2009 article publishedinThe
Nation.

Yearly, that totals more than $4.4
billion ofloan money thatgoestoward
bank fees instead of helping students.
Also, the U.S. Depai1:mentofEducation
repoited in its 2011 projections that it
would have to relieve FFEL lenders of

of its 8,600—member staff when “our
coimtry can least afford to lose tl1em.”

“Congress could have achieved its
reform andsavingsgoals inawaythat
helped botlistudents andworkers, but
instead chose not to,” she said.

She’s right to worry about the jobs
her company provides. But as a stu-
dent, easingthe burdenthatcomeswith
the investment of a college education
takes top priority, and every dollar

saved helps. _

This bill should actually give some
tangible beneﬁts to students when it
goes into eifect injuly. But if Pitt were
to increase its in-state tuition justtliree
percent, it would effectively offset any
advantage gained from the Pell Grant or
the adjustmentinservioe fees, account-
ingfora $430 tuition increase.

Back in November when I was in-
vited to speak at the tuition tax hear-
ingwith City Council, I made a point -
to mention that there are a signiﬁcant
number of students, not padded by
parental wallets, who are struggling
ﬁnancially through college. ‘

Aiterl spoke, currentSGBPresident ‘

Charlie Shull tookhis turn.Despite the
fact that the tuitiontax is off the table,
Iwonder if ouretforts were useless.Pitt
has historically increased tuition rates
faster than the rate of inﬂation. Last
yearthe University nobly halted tuition
increases to align with the 2008 inﬂa-
tion rate of3.8 percent. But ithasraised
rates inthepastﬁveyears ashighas
6.49 percent. The University trustees
have decided to postpone the armual
tuitiontalkuntil the summerthis year;
coincidentally the same time the new

lawsbegintotakeeifect.

Iftuition were to rriirror the inﬂa-

tion rate again for next year, our rates

should go down 0.4 percent instead of
up, accountingforthe nation’s negative

BecausePittaskedustoﬁghttokeep

to raise‘ tuition inspite ofthe Pell Grant
changes and the asinine city proposal
we fought against last year.

Students, more than ever, are fac-
ing ﬁnancial hardship through this
recession. ‘

I’m not a fan of government hand-
outs, but education, especially from

publicly—funded institutions, ought to -

be more accessible to anyone whohas
the academic credentials to be there.
And it oughtto be affordable, too.

So out of $938 billion, at least the
government allocated $36 billion of it
properly. I doubt working to ﬁx health‘
carewill solve anyofourcoiint1y’s more
immediate problems, but working to

Throughout the decades, cinema
has amassed an unbeatable ros-

King Kong to Alien, Mothra to

able in at least one- respect: making
ridiculous villains.
Unfortunately, I fear‘ even this
capacity has waned in recent years.
Where is today’s “Creature from

is today’s “The Thing” (1982)? It

seems like the only place you can
ﬁnd lovable camp nowadays is the
SyFy channel (see “Mansquito”).
Still, as the'3-D beast spectacle
‘.‘C1ash of the Titans” hits theaters

, According to Gosik, this also
helps the theater make the pro-
duction unique to that particular
creative team.

“You don’t want to go into
it trying to copy the movie,” he
said. “That is somebody else’s
performance, not yours. We’re
fortunate in that our script ﬂesh-

es out [my] character more than ‘

in the movie, where they just ﬁnd
him and he comes along. You get
backstory.”

The backstory includes a ro-
mance that ends with the Wicked
Witch casting a spell on the Tin
Man and replacing his parts with
tin, Gosik said.

“It was a revelation when I
read that,” he said. “He really is
a real person. Approaching him
that way and ﬁnding honest emo-
tions, not being a caricature of a
walking statue, helped me come
at it not from 1939 but in 2010.
His quest to ﬁnd a heart is very
special to me.”

The Tin Man travels with Dor-
othy looking for a heart, only to
be told by the Wizard of Oz him-
self he is lucky not to have one at
the end of his journey. The Tin
Man, however, says something
that strikes Gosik.

“There’s a moment where he
says ‘I still want one,”’ he said.
“For me, that is the message of
the show. You have to risk having
your heart broken. To me, playing
that part isreally afﬁrming.”

way — that there’s something
wro ng with them. What you come
to learn is you are good enough;
the thing you think you lack has
always been there, you have to
see it in yourself,” he said.

Gosik also hopes that children
who see his show will react the__
same way he did when, in the sec-

ond grade, he saw his ﬁrst mu-

sical, “Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat,” with
his mother. _

“I fell in love right there,” he
said. “This is my ﬁrst tour and I’m
glad to do it because of the kids.
I hope there are kids who react
the same way I did and that I can
spark a love of theater, as actors
or audience members.”

song with a name as intimidating as the music
emanating from the TV speakers. That song
was “Clint Eastwood.”

the songs are instantly catchy and demon-
strate something the band appears to have
developed immunity to: slump albums.
Gorillaz’ distinctively diverse style is per-
haps the album’s biggest hurdle. Covering
such awide range of styles with only 16 tracks
doesn’t damage any of the songs’ integrity,
but it’s a bit overwhelming to take in as a co-

hesive experience. Some of the wonderful A .

trademarks of a sound are lost, and Damon
Albarn’s voice occasionally seems to be hid-
ing in the track. A K

Gorillaz may be a virtual band, but the

craft one of the most emotionally potent
monster ﬁlms of all time. Of course, it would
still ‘fall ﬂat without a memorable baddie.
Thankfully, the faceless, ﬁsh—like creature
spawned from the chemical refuse of Se'oul’s
Han River delivers on the most fundamental
promise of the genre: a freakish villain to
haunt a generation.

Gollum (“The Lord of the Rings: The Two

- Towers”): “Lord of the Rings”‘broke ground

in several respects, but one of its most over-

looked achievements is the complexity of
Gollum’s character. Through equal amounts

of deft acting and CGI wizardry, the geniuses

at New Line Cinema managed to somehow

make a morally, ambiguous lmonster.~Re—,
ally, up until halﬁvay through “Return of.
the King,” I didn’t know whether Gollum

was truly evil or just ugly as hell and slightly

schizophrenic. "

‘ Clover (“Cloverﬁeld”): Many people were
disappointed with “Cloverﬁeld” because it
didn’t live up to its trailer’s cryptic genius.
And though it’s true that, gimmicky hand—‘
held camera aside, “Cloverﬁeld” never strays
from monster-movie convention, it has a
creature to rival the greats: a sprawling, spi-
der-like monster that periodically poops out
little spider monsters. In my opinion, that
alone makes this movie worthwhile.

The Smoke Monster (“Lost”): Okay, this
is actually from a TV show, but I couldn’t
resist giving a shout—out to the infamous
smoke monster, perhaps the most inventive
villain to grace the small screen. Its freight-

_ train speed, superhuman intelligence and

awful mechanical grumble make it, at least
in my mind, the aspect of the show most
likely to endure if, God forbid, it ends in. a
convoluted mess. ' 1- - '

‘The Flying Dinosaur Things (“Pitch

Black”): Believe it or not, before “The Paci—'

ﬁer” Vin Diesel used to be sort of hardcore.
In the midst of that brief golden age was
“Pitch Black,” a ﬁlm made legendary by the
nocturnal winged aliens that swarm a team

(during an eclipse. Don’t,worry — in this

movie, Vin Diesel can see in the dark.’The
rest of the crew, however, is not so lucky. .
Rasputin (“Hellboy”): I’m a huge fan of
any man .with the audacity to grow a foot-
long beard, so Guillermo del Toro’s choice of
Rasputin as asort of all—powerful cosmic ad-
versary sits well in my book. Rasputin’s ter-
rifying enough, but a Rasputin who doubles
as a tentacled overlord? Too evil to resist.
The Balrog (“The Lord of the Rings: The
Fellowship of the Ring”): All three “Rings”
ﬁlms are rife with fantastical creatures, but
nothing, in my opinion, can beat the Balrog,
a gargantuan, winged, horned lava beast
from Hell  or something. I’m still vague
on its purpose, or place in the story, but one
thing is clear: it’s the epitome of evil. What
more could you ask for from a monster?

No scenes wasted in ‘A Prophet’  

Prophet 4 14

Jordi . .

Soon, Cesar arranges Malik’s temporary leaves
from jail so that he can do work for the prisoner.
But unbeknownst to Cesar, Malik is putting to-
getherhis ownbusiness while doing Ce_sar’s work
on his visits to the outside.

Malik’s rise to the top symbolizes the Ameri-
can dream —— it’s just taking place in France. A
strange mixture of smarts, luck and good timing
contribute to his successes. He’s lucky (or cursed,
perhaps) thattheArabhehastoﬁrstkillﬁnds Ma-

Pitt drops 2
to Providence

Michael Furlong
For the Pitt News

Despite taking leads in both con—H

' tests, the Pitt softball team could

not hold on.
The Panthers dropped two

‘games to conference opponent

Providence College during a Satur-
day doubleheader at Trees Field.
The softball squad entered the
showdown against Providence with
a 13-11 record on the season. Provi-
dence came into the game with just
a 6-13 record. It was the opening

. Big-East series for both teams.

After the losses, Pitt Head
Coach Holly Aprile said, “We did

not play well. We didn’t hit the ball;
we are remaining inconsistent at
the plate and because of that, we
are unable to win games without

scoring any runs.” 4

In the ﬁrst game of the double-
header, junior pitcher Cory Ber-
liner was effective throughout most
of the outing on the mound, setting
the Friars down in order in the ﬁrst
three innings and giving up just
two runs in 5.2 innings. The effort
wasn’t enough, as the Panthers
dropped the ﬁrst game 7-2.

Pitt (13-13) took a 2-0 lead in
the bottom of the third inning af-
ter junior centerﬁelder Reba Tutt

 59 games. game lead on the'Nets. Mark your calen- Some joked that Charlotte has to pin don’t have a curse. l

~<.:-.

Unfortunately, the 2010 Nets’ .123 win-
ning percentage puts them just 48 games
behind Cleveland in the Eastern Confer-
ence. They were eliminated from playoff
contention almost a month ago. Not even
the Pirates get knocked out that early.
Come on, even the Knicks are still alive.

Washington, the team directlyahead
of Newjersey in the East, is on a 15-game
losing streak. The Wizards haven’t won
since Feb. 28, yet they still have a 131/2

dar: the two teams play April 4.

Of course, Washington’s 15—game losing
streak pales in comparison to New_]ersey’s
18—gamer to start theyear. It started out
as a funny sports story, but it grew in-
creasingly embarrassing. When the Nets

ﬁnally won a game — against Charlotte,-

97-91 —— in December, the coverage went
away, but that didn’t stop the Nets from
putting up two more double-digit losing
streaks before January ended.

a scarlet “L” on its jerseys for the rest of
the season.

There’s no shame in being a Nets fan,
though. Every franchise has its down year.

’ Newjersey is simply ﬁlling the role of the

laughably bad sports team for now. The
Chicago Cubs stepped in for a while, but
then they spent money. Philadelphia in

,. general did nicely for about 20 years, but

then the Phillies ruined everything.
There’s only one problem. The Nets

 

 

Everyperennial loser has a curse. The
Boston Red Sox had the Curse of the Bam-

bino rule strong for 86 years. Philadelphia T‘

had the Curse of Billy Penn, which doomed
the city for building a skyscraper taller
than city hall. Chicago still u,ses'an actual
goat as a scapegoat.

It can’t simply be the Nets’ fault that

the Nets are 9-64. Some ghost, some an-
gry beer vendor, some hex from a dis-
gruntled usher is to blame. What doomed
the Nets? '

Let’s look at the roster ﬁrst. The Nets
start Devin Harris, Yijianlian, Brook Lo-
pez, Trenton Hassell and Courtney Lee.

Lopez is known for his time. at Stanford
with his twin brother Robin. The Nets,
though, only have Brook on their roster.
Could this be the Curse of the Separated

I Twins? Sadly, it isn’t that simple. The
» . Phoenix Suns have been ﬁne with only

Robin. V - _
Formercoach Lawrence Frank led the
Nets to an 0-16 start before he was ﬁred,

but the blame doesn’t lay on him for the A

Nets losing more games than some MLB
teams. Most members ofthe media ac-
knowledged New Jersey’s talent-lacking
lineup at the time of his ﬁring. ~ ’

But you can’t ﬁre the players, so
maybe the curse is in the front ofﬁce,
with general manager Kiki Vandeweghe
jinxing the franchise. _

The team hired him in 2007, the
last time it posted a winning record.

After-all, Vandeweghe never won an

NCAA Championship oran NBA cham-
pionship as a player, and he also once
drafted Nikolo_z Tskitishvilififth over-

_ all. Sounds like a curse. A
Or maybe the curse goes deeper.‘

Technology is everywhere these days
— did a disgruntled television;pro—
ducer curse theiteam that airs on his
network? It sounds nice, butunfortu—
nately the Nets play on the YES Net'-
work, home tothe 173:time world
champion New York Yankees.

A curse on the home arena -— like
the Cubs’ Curse of the Billy Goat —
also fails for this reason. The Devils

had no problem winning three Stanley ‘

Cups‘ playing in the Izod Center, for-
merly the Continental Airlines Arena.

It also doesn’t explain the Nets’ 4-33 .

road record. p y .

In the end, any good curse comes
from the top. The Nets are owned by
a business group that includes rapper

Jay-Z. With no other reason why the ’

Nets are playing so poorly, I have to
look at some of his rap lyrics, which
mightlhave inadvertently done the

trick: I got 99 problems_, but a strug-

gling basketball franchise with no
leadership or talent ain’t one. '
Sounds like avjinxpto me-.»
