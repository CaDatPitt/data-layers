5th in Series,

"The Student Council of Re-
ligious Organizations is "spon-
soring the ﬁfth monthly "pro-
gram on religious traditions
represented on campus.

. This month’s program will
feature Dr. Walter Harrelson, dean

of the divinity school, University

of Chicago. Dr. Harrelson will
speak to students and faculty at
noon this Wednesday on the topic,
“Man’s .Quest.for God.” An in-
formal discussion hour will fol-
low at 3 ‘p.m. «

A‘ Dr. Harrelson, an ordained Bap-
tist’ minister, completed \under-
graduate studies at Mars Hill Col-
lege, and at "the University of
North Carolina, where he received
the A.B. degree in 1947.

He studied theology’ at Union
Theological Seminary in New
York, receiving the degree of
Bachelor of Divinity and Doctor
of Divinity and Doctor of Theo-
logy. He also took advanced
work at Harvard and at Basel
University, Switzerland.

Before hisappointment in 1955
as dean of the divinity school, Dr.
Harrelson held the posts of in-
structor in philosophy at the Uni-

-versity of North Carolina; tutor,
assistant, and instructor in The

Old Testament at Union Theo-
logical seminary. A
‘He was also professor of The
Old Testament at Andover New-
ton Theological School in _Mass-
achusetts, and associate professor
of the Old Testament at Federat-
ed Theo1ogical.Faculty.. *
Dr. Harrelson’s publications
“are largely in the ﬁeld of biblic-
al studies, although he‘ has lec-
tured and written considerably
‘ on subjects of a more general
nature in Christian theology.

Among his publications are

_ “Jeremiah, Prophet to the "Na-

tions,” (1959), and a number of
special studies published in the
Journals, of Religion,‘ Religion in
Life, ‘Biblical "Research, _ Interpre-

This seems to be the general
feeling. that has swallowed and
surrounded the student body. Jar-

'rell’s report suggested that al-
though SGA members are in a‘

' position to stimulate ' interest,
especially now at elections, the
responsibility does not lie entirely
in their hands.

Other organizations and espec-
ially the student body, itself, is
obligated’ to take interest in their
university and to help when they
are needed. . _ I

The lack of co-operation of

behind-the-scene parts of every
activity or organization is ap-
parent. However, the .work is
being done—don‘e by a ‘minority

Jarrell went on. to say that the
administration « is ' willing , to do
anything within reason, and that
this is apparent since they are do-
ing more than their share" of the
work. ~ I _ .

Bob Fulton withdrew his mo-
tion that ‘S§'A adopt the proposal
of the judicial committee con-
cerning the by-laws to the con-
stitution. He- said that until the
new government is in office, there
is no official procedure to begin
action;

After the new government is
in office, and their structure has

Ask Fairness ’

On Tuition

“Students are deﬁnitely en-
titled to know how much
their college education will
cost. This "vital knowledge is
withheld until they are al-
most forced either to remain
at a school where. they feel the‘ .
tuition is exhorbitant or to leave - ’
college altogether.” p ',

In the above campaign state-
ment, Chuck Isler and Phil Wil-
1iam_s challenged the university to
ﬁnd a manner of making tuition

increases more fair to university I
students. Isler and Williams, are.

candidates for‘, president and vice  it

president,» ' respectively, of ' the _ '
student body. 
“Students in their junior and: S;
senior years n are held captive iv
here, for to transfer /to another
school, to. make new associa-_
tions, to learn new requirements
and possibly to lose hard-earned
credits, is a burden that few are '
willing to undertake." ’ l .
Two possible solutions to the ’
problem have been proposed by‘
Isler and Williams. The ﬁrst in‘-'
volves the publication of any
planned tuition increases four or
ﬁve years in advance of the time
they will ‘go into effect. ‘ ‘_
Since speciﬁc increases in costs
cannot be accurately predicted,
this proposed solution would prob-
ably be regarded unfavorably by
the administration, the pair said.
The second means of alleviat-I
ing the problem," _they feel,-
would be fair to both the stu-
dents and the university._Upon
admission to the ‘university, as ..
a freshman or otherwise, the
student‘ would enter_ into an
agreement with the administra-
tion" that while he remains ‘a
full-time student, he [will pay~
only the original rate. V’

, Letters.To The Editor

Spirit There, Seats Not _

For Mounty Came
Editor, the Pitt News:
I’m typing this letter at 8:45
on the night of the Pitt-West
Virginia tilt in the S.U. We did

go to the game. We had been

hearing. a lot about the lack of
student support, but this was not
the reason we went.'We happen
to like basketball. ‘

We picked up our tickets at
the student desk and noticed
that special pains had been tak-
en‘ to keep student attendance
low. As we waited at the gate, I
saw a boy in my economics class
denied admission. He had his
ticket, but had left his student
identiﬁcation card in the dorms.

We got in, but it didn’t do us
much good. ‘There were no seats.
Most of the student section had
been sold as reserve seats. We
found ourselves packed amongst
other students who’ were forced
to stand in the entrance . . . the

. entrance which a policeman kept
walking through to widen a path
for ticket holders.

.’We weren’t actually forced to
leave. We would have sat be-
hind the bleachers and li_stened
to the crowd yell. We left.

There were many people,
though, who did not have to
leave. These people are com-
parative strangers to the uni-
versity. They paid a dollar
apiece to see that game. Is our
university fee a farce? I’m be-
ginning to think so.

The large amounts of money
the university pays for athletic
scholarships and equipment is
evidently not for the beneﬁt of
the student. Is this What we are
being. accused of. not supporting?
Where else is the individual stu-
dent given so little considera-
tion? '

Is the university in such dire.

Student Voices Opinion

About Political Radicals

Editor, the Pitt ‘News:

The, chill winds whipping

around the Cathedral bring with
. them again this year the stink

of radicals sounding off about
.the inadequacies of S.G.A. and

student politics. »

As sure as the appearance of
jolly St. Nick at Christmas, at
election time these radicals pull
out their bags of tricks, get up

on their soap boxes in the Tuck
Shop, in fraternity houses, and
at S.G.A. meetings, and talk
through their beards. 4

Unfortunately, there is no es-
cape from these eloquent radi-
cals. At the slightest drop of
your guard you may see a blond,

blue-eyed dissenter heading your

way with his,mouth going a
mile-a—minu'te and saying noth-
ing. '

Even while leafing through
these honorable pages, looking
for the “Little Man on Campus”
cartoon, I run into letters by_
these radicals.

This year the integrity of Mr.
Isler and Mr. Williams is being
questioned. Next year, who

_knows ‘what these status seekers

will disagreewith. A
However, I must agree with

' Wednesday. ‘February 8.’ 1!)6o-’—'1'iHE PITT.‘ li~1EWS—'P}tge 3

‘them on one point. One ‘-parti- «

cularly vehement radical stated
in the Jan. 27 issue:- “Student
government will never get off
its feet.” Why? Because of the
chill.winds whipping ’round the
Cathedral ‘with their stink ‘of
radicals.

Instead of talking about the
inadequacies of S.G.A. and stu-
dent politics, why not actually
do something about them? Say,
at a “Turner for President” rally
or, as a case at random, in the
judicial committee. Maybe in
this way Pitt can get the kind
of student government is evid-
ently needs so badly.

And in closing, dear Mr. Edi-
tor, I admonish you for. printing
such radical ramblings in your
paper. You are very -naughty
and should have your hands
slapped. A

Carnegie Tech
Battles Panthers
For City Title

By TED COLTON

 

 

The mytical City League championship will be on the
line tonight at the Field House when" our fearless Panthers
take on the- Little Tartans of Carnegie Tech. This year is
Tech’s big chance to knock off their city rivals and winvthe

‘ mythical title. » .

‘They have conquered once mighty Duquesne for the

.‘ﬁrst.time in 22 years. They will be out gunning for the

  

 

‘that they are better than their major rivals.

Panthers in the worst way. This is their big‘ chance to show
Bill Soﬁa will be the big gun for the Tartans while
Mike Flynn has been compared to Jerry West, All—American
from West Virginia, because of his clutch performances when
the games are close. They also have Andy Komer, George
Frazier, and Stan, Skalka, all pretty fair basketball players.
Should the Cats drop this one to the Tartans, our.
basketball season will hit a new low. A major university
like Pitt just “ain’t” supposed to lose to our little cousins‘
from across the road. But fear not, for Coach Bob

- 3 Timmons has the Panthers on the move.

They have conquered mighty Dartmouth, Ivy League

‘champs, and lost to fourth ranked West Virginia by only ten

points. Although their record stands at 7-9 they still have

 a chance to make the season a success. They need two wins"

over Tech; win the rest of their home games and upset either.

Tankers Meet

NYU Violets

The swimmers of NYU will be
invading Panther home territory,
the Carnegie Tech pool, this Sat-
urday night at 8:00 p.m. A ‘

The Violets dropped last year’s
meet to the Aquatic Cats by a
score of 62-24, but Coach Ben
Grady "predicts a close tussle.

The Violets will bring three
three returning lettermen with
them; Glazer, Ashare, and
Lathe'r.
and 100-yard freestyle, but will
be no match for Jim Emert.

F rosh Hoopsters
Host Tech F rosh

Tonight at the Field House,
Coach Carl Peterson’s freshmen
hoopsters will attempt to snap a
three game losing streak. Their
opponents for this evening’s con-

Glazer swims the 50 '

test are the Carnegie Tech frosh.
‘After ten games the Panther
yearlings show a record of ﬁve
victories and live defeats. In-
dividual scoring honors go to Ben
Jinks who has averaged 19.7
points per game. Mostof the in-
side scoring has been handled by
- the Cub’s two big men, John
, Maczuzak and’ Billy Law.
Jump-shooting John Larkin and
George Dewey have been doing
the ‘bombing from the outside.
Coach Peterson’s teal leader and
. play caller is 5’-9” bockcourtman
Howdy Dapper.

However, Ashare placed second
in the 200 individual medley last
year ahead, of Panther hopeful
Pat Fitzgerald. Lather could be‘
a darkhorse but as it stands now
Grady doesn’t expect much
trouble from him.

Coach Ben Grady is pleased
with the performance of his 400-
yard freestyle relay team, which
turned in its best time of the sea-
son against Ohio last Saturday. He
predicts, “If we can get within.
41 or 42 points before the ﬁnal
race, I know they can’t beat my
relay team and we would win.”

Panthers to Oppose .0 Tartans  
Tonite; Play Benefit Saturday

A

By JACK SMITH
-Back from their ﬁrst road win of the campaign, the
Panthers will meet Carnegie Tech tonight’ at the Field House.
Since this game is part of the inter-city rivalry, anything

can be expected.

Coach Mel Cratsley has a fast moving team that shoots
well and presently holds ﬁrst place’ with Westminster in the

West Penn Conference. Tech plays
a tight defense and, on offense,
will,shoot from the outside.

“They have a rough team,”
Coach -Bob Timmons said. “We
have to stop Bill Soffa and their
other outside shooters who, if let
loose, will kill you.” Other Tech
starters to watch are George Fraz-
ier and Andy Komer.

Triple-Header Slated

A wrestling match, a wheelchair
basketball exhibition and the
Panthers game with New York
University will be the program
Saturday night at the Field House
in a triple-header. The proceeds
go to the Easter Seal Society for

’ Crippled Children.

NYU Drills

_ Early,in the season NYU, pre-
sently holding a 10-2 record, pos-

sessed the speed and shooting‘

ability but couldn’t control the

boards. Rossini then started a
weekly drill known as “Bloody
Friday.”

In this drill eight men are
placed under one basket. A
manager then throws the ball
up against the blackboard and

V the players 'in+an every man

for himself, no fouls called—

. game try to put the ball through

the hoop. Usually the man with
ten baskets wins.

“This drill" has not only helped -‘

our rebounding,” Rossini said, but
it has made the boys conscious of
positioning for rebounds and giv-
en them a desire to play better
defensive’ ball.” ‘
Sanders All-American

- NYU’s All-American candidate
Tom Sanders is their most potent
threat. Sanders 6’-7” is the team’s
leading rebounder and shooter,
averaging better than 21 points

per game. Sanders runs well and-

excells on defense. ,
Other Violet starters are Al
Barden, 6-5, Ray Paprocky, Russ
Cunningham and Jim Reiss.
Cunningham usually controls
the game and works the ball.
“We have a good team,” Ros-
sini said. “If our rebounding was
a little better we could give any
team in the country trouble.”
NYU is expected to use a man-
to man defense. On offense neither
a zone or press has bothered the
Violets. This doesn’t leave the
Panthers much to throw "at the
New Yorkers, except a home town
crowd. 5

Panther Flying Rings.
Ace HasSights on Title

By LARRY HAGGERTHY
The main objective of

Panther gymnast Dave Hirst ‘

is to win the 1960 EIGL and
NCAA ﬂying rings champion-
ships and thus keep a Blue

and" Gold tradition intact.

In 1957 and 1958 the Eastern
and National ring titles went to
Hirst’s roommate Tom Darling.
The boy’s-friendship began a few
years ago when they both attend-
ed Lincoln High School in Phila-
delphia; Just two weeks ago
against Navy ‘at, Annapolis Hirst
broke Darling’s _all—time Panther
ring record of 285 by registering
288 points. -

Hirst tied for second in last
year’s NCAA tourney and also
ﬁnished second in the ‘Easterns.
Hirst was undefeated in dual com-
petition but lost in the Easterns
to Army’s John Aaronson and to
Jay Werner of Penn State in the
Nationals. A

After graduating from high
school, Hirst passed up lucrative
offers from such gym powers as
Penn State, Syracuse, Temple,
,Michigan State, and Florida
State to enter Pitt.

“I knew a lot of the guys on
the Pitt team from Philadelphia
and ‘decided that was the‘ school
for me after several visits to Pitts-
burgh. I'm real glad now that I
made that choice because everyone
has been _good to me here,” Hirst
said. . r

As a sophomore, Hirst broke

the all-time Panther scoring re-
cord of John Hammond by tally-
ing 111 points. His top three
events were the rings, parallel
bars’, and tumbling. He. was seen
ond and third on the rings _in
the_ Easterns and Nationals re-
spectively. ‘
Hirst was all set to lead Coach
Warren Neiger’s gymnasts to a
possible -Eastern team title in 1958
when he tore the triceps in his
left arm in pre-season" practice.
He was forced to miss the entire
season and thus ended any Pan-
ther chance for the EIGL title.

Raqueteers Face
Dickinson Team
Away on Saturday

Coach Bill Summers’ squash-
men will jburney to Carlisle, Pa.,
Saturday to play the Red-Devils
of Dickinson in their third squash
match of the year.

The raqueteers now sport a 2-1
record with victories over Ford-
ham and Penn, while losing.only
to Army.

This is Dickinson’s ﬁrst year of
playing squash and the Panthers
look for an easy victory. Dickin-
son lost to Penn 6-3, whereas‘ the
locals beat Penn by‘ the -same
score. .

With Morry Oliver ineligible
Knobby Knouse must move up to
the number three spot and his
teammates below him on the
squash ladder must each advance
a position.

Matmen Set  
For Match
With Army *7

By ran COLTON

_ Can the Panther. m-atmen
bounce back after their ﬁrst‘
defeat? _ That's what Rex
Peery wants to know as he
prepares his grapplers . for
their upcoming meet with —.
Army Saturday at the Field House.
The match will start at 6:30 p.m.

and will preceed the Panther-'9" V-5'?“
NYU basketball game. :‘

Army will be rough in the high-
er weight classes and the Cats
will have their work cut- out for
them. If they are going to win,
theywill have to capture the ﬁrst
ﬁve classes. After that Army will
present a strong array of heavy-
weights. —' 1

Al Rushatz is Army’s best man.
He will" probably be wrestling‘ at
177 and will draw Len Vuocolo~ ~=—
as his man. Rushatz beat Vuocolo
up at the Wilkes tournament but, .
Len is ‘looking forward‘ to _meet-

‘ing him again. “He can be had,”

commented th e Panther f 177

pounder. A,
Other standouts for the Cadets
are Bob Eckman, 167 pounder.
and, the Miller boys, William
and Harry who will wrestle at
191 and heavyweight respective-
ly} T O’ - - I I
In the light weight divisions the
Panthers should take the ﬁrst four """
classes with Dick Martin, 123,
Larry Lauchle, ‘130, Daryl Kelv-
ington, 137, and John Zolikoif at
147. This may leave the outcome
of the meet in the hands of August ‘
Arrigone who will be the Cat 157
pounder. If_ Arrigone can win the 
Blue and Gold will have the meet ‘
won. ’

The rest of the Panther line—up
will consist of Joe Schmitt ‘at 167,
Vuocolo at 177, Tom Hall at 191 M’
and Bob Guzik will wrestle heavy-
weight. .

.Four undefeated records will

be on the line" Saturday. Martin,
Lauchle, Kelvington and Zoli-
koif have yet to be beaten in
dual meet competition this year.

Martin will be returning to ac- ‘
tion after a two week absence. He J
has been ‘bothered with a cluster
of boils on his knee. But the boils
are almost gone and he should be
able to‘ wrestle by Saturday. The
Peerymen now have a 3-1 record ~
with ﬁve matches remaining on “r '
the schedule.
