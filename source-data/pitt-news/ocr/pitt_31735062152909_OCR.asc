on GUARD REUNION
wAs GREAT success

Musical Club of Early 90’s Meet
at Elwyn Park and Make
Merry to Queen’s Taste.

LAUGHLIN CHIEF COOK.

The Old Guard reunion held at
Elwyn Park, in the South Hills,
Thursday, June 10th, was a howling
success in more than one respect. It
was a success because “Punch” Laugh-
lin broiled a beef steak that made the
mouths of the old boys water and, like
Oliver Twist, call for more. It was a
success because Bert Smyers, “Clap-

 

 

per Bert.” Calvert, “Wal1ie” Riddle,
“Al” Hamilton, “Charlie” Locke,
“Sam” Stewart, “Billy” Berger,

“Jack” High, and other high lights
were there, and it was a success be-

good time, sang with much gusto, and
threw all dignity and stiffness to the
four winds. The stiffness came back
in double quantities the following day,
of course, and as aresult of baseball,
volley ball and other strenuous sports
engaged in by those whose occupation
has been making money and pulling
olf big busines sdeals. But that didn't
matter. "It was a success, neverthe-
less, and will be long remembered by
all who attended.

The “Old Guarders” arrived at the
park about 12 noon and spent the en-
tire afternoon. The athletic feature
was the ball game. It ﬁnally broke

up when “Ump. Charlie” Locke called

a man out for hitting a ball into the
creek. “Clapper” Smyers at this stage
of the game started to froth at the
mouth to such an extent that it was
deemed wise to call off hostilities be-
fore blood was spilled. Locke. was
armed’ with a bat and Smyers w
going for him when “Punch” Laug
lin cried out “Let 'us have peace.”

Smyers is ordinarily-a rather peace-
ful sort of an individual and we are
unable ‘to account for this sudden
burst of temper unless it was due to
the way he was togged out. On his
dome was a red cap of the vintage
of ’76 and surrounding his neck and
falling in graceful’ lines down the
front of his shirt was a lurid necktie
of blue and gold colors. It was some
necktie and caused some comment in
the bleachers. It must have been this
sporty decoration that got Bert into
trouble.

The “Old Guard” is made up of
members of the musical clubs back in
the early 90’s and is a permanent or-
ganization. A reunion will be held
annually.

Prof. Fetterman is -azlmember of

“old guard” boys call him “Doc.” "

As far back as the oldest inhabi-
tants can remember “Bert” Smyers
has been Treasurer of the General
Alumni association and a rival con-
didate would have about as much
chance to oust him from the position
of guardian of exchecquer as there is
for the moonto turn to green cheese.
He is a member of the “Old Guard”
and_ a right loyal one he is, too.

Mr. Smyers is Secretary of the
Pittsburgh Trust Co. and is a product
of Indiana county. He received his A.
B. from W. U. P. in‘ 1893 and entered
the service of the company of which
he is now secretary.. To keep himself

Class Reunions Bring Former
Students Together. —— Lun-
cheons, Banquets and Other
Aﬁairs Held. '

MANY “TAKE DAY. OFFJ’

The class reunions this year have
been attended with much enthusiasm
and with a good start made much
greater activity can ,_be looked for in
the future. X

Many of the classes will have spe-
cial table reservations. at the com-
mencement banquet at the Hotel
Schenley this evening. Yesterday was
alumni day and hundreds of graduates
visited the campus, registered at the
alumni tent, and were shown around
the buildings, and over the campus by
the student guides, under the direction
of the alumni workers. Many follow-
ed the suggestion to “take a day off”
and spent the time on the campus, ad-
,miring the buildings, equipment and
general surroundings of the Schenley
Farms. Fraternities entertained their
alumni with special luncheons and, al-
together, everyone had a good time
and went home , with more spirit and
“pep” for Pitt. '

The class of 1910 had a banquet
last night at the Pittsburgh Athletic
Associatioii, with Dr. “Uncle Dan”
Carhart as the honor guest. The at-
tendance was good and all the famous
1910ers were back. One of the nota-
.bles who attended was R. W. Richards,
better known as “Tex,” who led a
varsity football team that was not
scored on. Richards is located in ‘But-
ler, Pa., with the Standard Steel Car
Company.

The 1914 men will attend the com-
mencement exercises in a body to-
day and at 1 ‘P. M. will have a class
luncheon at the Hotel Schenley. In
the afternoon they will take in the
varsity-alumni ball game and to-
night will be at the annual commence-
ment banquet. Mark A. Follansbee
?n_d R. E. Grove are boosting this af-

air. ‘

Men of 1907 were stirred up by Prof.
J. S. Lambie and had a luncheon at
the Schenley yesterday. Many mem-
bers of these classes “came back.”
The class of 1912 had a gathering
and dedicated their class memorial on
the campus.

The class reunions are a ’ “go.”

busy, he read law on the side and was
admitted to the bar in 1896, although
he ihasnever had to fall back on that
profession for a living.

When at W. U . P. he was mixed up
in everything, athletics, etc. He was
quarterback of the ﬁrst football team
the University ever had. He is a mem-
ber of, the Duquesne club, Phi Zeta
Phi Fraternity, and a dozen or more
other clubs. We could write a book
about “Bert” but have to cut off for
lack of space. Some time we’ll tell
his life story in these columns. It
would read like a Horatio Alger book.

It was a distinct compliment to the
tireless energy and loyalty of Prof.
Alexander Silverman that he should
be re-elected‘ to the chairmanship -of

TO BE INFORMAL AFFAIR.

The annual commencement day ban-
quet will be held to-night at the Hotel
Schenley at 6:30 and a record break-
ing turnout of alumni, students and
friends of the University is expected.

< The banquet is to be a strictly infor-

mal affair. Ladies are cordially in-
vited to be present. It islnot an in-
vitation affair and any’ one who is in-
terested in the University of Pitts-
burgh is welcome. to come.

The principal speaker will be Am-
bassador George W. Guthrie, of the
class of .1866. Mr. Guthrie is a for-
mer president of the General Alumni
Association and a “grad” of the Uni-
versity who has ever been loyal to
alma mater. -His rise in the world of
civic and national politics has been
watched closely by the sons and
daughters of the University and an
ovation will be tendered him to-night.
It was ﬁtting that he should have
been selected‘ as a speaker at the an-
nual commencement festivities of the
alumni and undergraduates of Pitt. -

In addition to Chancellor McCor-
mick, who will tell of some of the
plans of the University for the future,
J. Clare George, ’15, who will speak
frgm an undergraduate’s standpoint,
there will -be three other speakers.
One of them will probably be Howard
Heinz, the “live wire” son of H. J.
Heinz, who has given Pitt money for
a student building. At the time the
PITT WEEKLY went to press Mr.
Heinz was unable to give his ﬁnal
word as he is a very busy man and
other activities have made him cau-
tious as to his 'health.. The chances
are, however, that he will be at the
speaker’s table. Mr. Heinz’s activities
in the three million dollar campaign
are well remembered and Pitt men
certainly want to hear -him again.
Two of the University’s noted guests
for the University exercises will be
the other speakers.

George  Kirk, ’12, will be here
from Washington, D. C., to lead the
cheers and songs and music will be
led by Gus A. Schnabel, ’15.:’”Presi-«
dent  C. Coffin, ’83, ‘of the General
Alu_mni_ Association, will conduct the
chain ritual for members of the senior
class, and J. Clare George, ’15, will
be the link bearer. The toast master
will be Harry S_._Calvert, '93, who is
noted for_his ability to put “pep” into
such affairs.’

The rate per plate is $2.00 and all
seniors who attend will receive a paid
up membership in the Alumni Asso-
ciation and the PITT WEEKLY With-
out charge to Jan. 1, 1915. Reserva-
tions can be made up to 5 P. M. at the
alumni tent and tickets will also be
on sale in the corridor of Memorial
Hall commencement morning. If you
are coming, make reservations before
the evening, if possible, so arrange-
ments can be made for handling the
crowd in advance.

sity back in the “dark ages” of 1906,
believes whereof he speaks when he
makes this broad statement as he re-
calls distinctly the many long hours
which_ Prof. Silverman put in on
alumni and athletic affairs in addition
£0 his regularwork as a faculty mem-
er.

Prof. Silverman was graduated
from the college in 1902 with the de'—
gree of _Ph.B. He_took his Master's
degree in 1907. Later he pursued
post-graduate work at Cornell, after
which he returned to his alma mater
and has been a member of the faculty
ever since. By hard and coi_iscientiou_s
work_ he has advanced to the position
of director of the Department of
Chemistry. Prof. Silverman is an ex-
pert in many subjects, and one of
them is_ “Glass.” He is winning coun-
try wide recognition for his re-
searches and inventions in this com-
mercial product and only recently was
called to Cornell, Yale, Columbia, and
other large institutions for special lec-
tures on the subject.

The University, the Alumni’ Asso-
ciation and other departments of Old
Pitt owe much to Silverman. ;

an 1895 graduate of the medical
school, has been placed in charge of
the Windber Hospital at Windber, Pa.,
and is now busy reorganizing the en-
tire institution, with a view to making
it one of the model hospitals of its
kind in the United States. The build-
ing and equipment are a gift to the
town by Mr. E. J. Berwind, the well
known coal magnate, the hospital
being situated in the center of one of
the great coal mining communities
of the country. Dr. McHenry. there-
fore, has unusual opportunities before
hiim. Pitt authorities who are fa-
miliar with Dr. McHenry’s capabili-

KERRWILL  
  GUIDE FRESH
.N_E_)_TT FAIJ.

The University" athletic authorities
have made another ten strike in se-
curing as the new coach in Freshman
football noneother than Prof. Andrew
Kerr. already employed as Varsity
tr}. ‘coach, The new appointment
will takeeﬁect in the coming fall.

This means that Mr. Kerr will give
up the work of coaching at, Central
High, and devote all his energies to
turning out classy athletic teams for.
Pitt. ‘His football duties will not be
ended until Dec. 1, and only a few
weeks intervene between -that date
and the opening of track activities
in the winter, so that his service to
the ‘University will be throughout
nearly the entire year. ’ I

The latest’‘‘‘* addition to Pitt’s‘ coach-
ing staff is a graduate of Dickinson.
in the class of 1900. He was an ath-
letici performer-during his course- at
Carlisle‘High, Conway Hall, and Dick-
inson College, competing actively in
every one of the four .major sports.
He was especially noted as a sprinter.

From 1900 to 190.6 Kerr was athletic
coachat Johnstown High, ,where he.
took delight in beating all the teams
of this section, including representa-
tives of this city. Comingtoi‘ Central

almost immediately on J ohnstown and
has throughout his connection with
the local school kept athletics there
on at very high level. Even so, ath-
letics are in a sense his “sideline,”
since_he is employed as head of the
mathematics department in Central
High. It is likely that he will ‘be
transferred to Schenley High as soon
as the new building is. completed, so
that he will be within a few minutes’
walk of. the iUniversity campus.

It is as a developer of star perform-
ers that Kerr’ has made his strongest
reputation. “Speedy” Rush, who goes

ton, this year, has nothing on the Var-
sity’s new acquisition in this particu-
ar. Kerr has developed .probably
more big varsity performers than any
other man in the United’ States.
Among them are Captain “Jack’.’;
Lindsay, of Pitt’s 1911 team; “Jim”
Munns, Cornell’s leader last fall;.
Frank Glick, the present q Princeton
"football captain; Leventry, the Cor-
nell tackle; Isadore Shapira, Pittfs
lineman; “Red” Bcbout, guard for
former State teams; Lyons the Michi-
gan .end; Karl Gass, another‘-Cornell
crack; John Baker and Dan McGeary,
basketball leaders of this district;
Rosenthal, Lambing-and Thomas, all.
Pitt track men;1 “Bob” Martin, a Yale
performer in -track and football‘; and
many others. No other coach could
hope to duplicate thislist. P

L Never before has Pitt been in such
need ofqa man like ‘Kerr, for the in-
struction of the Freshman aggrega-
tion. In 1916 will go-into effect the
one-year’ residence rule, which re-
quires that a student be in the Univer-
sity one year before he can compto
in intercollegiate athletics. This rule,
throws upon the Freshman team of
one ,year the great burden of provid-
ing men for the following year’s Var-
sity; and ‘it will be up to Kerri’,to' de-
velop Freshman‘ material which will
satisfy such a’ demand. Every Pitt
man is conﬁdent that he will measure
up ’ to the. requirements and will fill
the bill in every way. .

KJAND FIELDS‘ RECORD

Keeping up with the ﬁne records
made in the other lines of sport at
the University this year, the Varsity
trackteam has made a great showing.
Besides winning several meets, the
men have lowered»no less than six
records that stood on thegbooks at’ the
beginning of the season. Several of
the records broken were on the books
for some time, and the feat of the
men in lowering or raising them, as
the case mightbe, is all the more com-
mendable. ' »

“Jimmy”-. Burwell, the Washington
speed boy, lowered the 440-yard
record by 2-5 of a -second when he
negoiated the distance in 59 3-5
seconds. The former record ,of 51
seconds had been on the list for ﬁve
jlrzears andwas held by Harry Earle

oss.

for the -two miles, was lowered by
Livermore, a Freshman in Dentistry,
who made th edistance in 10 minutes

University record for the half-mile,
by making the distance in ;2 minutes
ﬂat. “Matt” Marshall, last year’s
captain, formerly held the record at
2 minutes 24-5 second. V

“Johnny” Sheehan and Louis Mc-

in~the broad jump and the pole vault
respectively, both bettered their own
marks made last year. E Shéehan

record by over a foot. Against.Car-

By H-. P. J.

The last; week.of school has been
fraught with much‘ anxiety for the in-
nates of the Track House. Every
day or so one of the fellows packs up
his trunk andhits the”trail for the
brush of his home town’ or neighbor-
hood- Incidentally he may use for
trunk ballast some’. articles that some
one else had the misfortune to prize.
After the first painful experience the
fellows who had ‘any choice posses-
sions‘ remaining began to exercise
their Sherlock Holmes tendencies in
refutation of any future emulator of
Gentl’eman‘Rafiies. . ’

“Bugs” cO’Donnell has a near-white
pair of trousers he values highly and
which he watches with an eternal vig-
ilance. “Yum” Grumbling and “Petie”
Heil each have a pair of ‘trousers
which once were white which have en-
deared themselves to their owners and
which are guarded with the same
studied care exercised by a smoker
in watching over his richest colored
meerschaum. “Foxy” Miller is pos-
sessed of the third—part of the crown
of an old grey felt hat, a relic of
Camp Windber, that “Foxy” uses as
an accessory to that ever nicely-lying
‘pompadour, and guards with the same
zealous care that his compatriots se-
cure a military secret. When the last
tnunk is packed and the last one of the
occupants of the house “Homeward
wends his weary way,” then only will
this careful espionage ofvalued pos-
sessions relax and the owners rest in
peace. .

A large number of the men at the
Training House are students of the
Dental ‘School and they never .‘for a
moment permit their companions to
forget that fact. First it was the
school quizzes which caused great con-
cern and then it was the‘ State Board
torture which was of. such importance
to these dental denizens of Mt.‘ Olym-
pus. Their daily communions were
conducted in a strange language made
up of strange characters, more pecu-
liar combinations of ﬁgures and words
that would have broken the jaw of
a lifelong resident of Przemysl or
Schenectady‘. , L ‘

Scarcely smaller in number than the
Friesell men are the so-called ‘fort-
unates from the. School of Economics.
Theirs too is a strange tongue, savor-'
ing of trial balances, the deeds of the

theories of‘ Beard or the lucid reason-_
ings of Seager. Theirs the gentle
joy to write voluminous note books"
and subscribe’. themselves‘ to number-
less English themes, not to ’mention
the hours of daily supergrind over the
books of -powder-dry . . accountancy.‘
These two delegations,‘ combined with
a sprinkling of Miners and one Col-
lege man make up the coterie whose
privilege it is to revel in the certain
joys of the Track House “Eats.” ,
It ‘were impossible to discover a’
bunch of men the size of that under
the limelight, each fellow of which
was possessed of more pronounced
personal ’characteristics. There was
“Steve” Dillon of therough but kindly
manners. “Steve” wore a forbidding
mask, but underneath there ‘was a
heart that was right. He left school
to’ take a berth with a professional
baseball club, but there was none
could bang the joker on the table with
more force or drive the pill further
from theuhome plate. f Among his
other virtues “it must be -said that
“Steve.” never was late for _a lineal.

our land, anative of the beleagered

BEST YEAR

Taking stock isn’t a popular amuse-

.ment for the fellow with nothing on

-his shelves. Striking a trial balance
doesn’t appeal to the gentleman with
-a large cash deﬁcit. But you can
give’ odds that the bank with‘ a big
-surplus on the right side will publish
a statement which will show that sur-
plus in the best possible light.

So it is with the, Pitt man today,
as he looks back on the past year of
achievement and forward to the com-
ing mont‘ charged with even great-
The meter for the
Blue and Gold has hardly a care; be-
side him, the average optimist is but
a poor, cheerless mortal. And there

is no reason for denying him the

privilege, in view of the record main-
tained by his pets during the past few
months, and the record he hopes they
will establish in the years to come.
Everybody knows it was back in
1904, when Pitt was WUP, that the
ﬁrst big football team gave the Uni-
versity a boost. There have been
several other good years since that

s time; but it remained for 1914 to set

a mark to shoot at in the future, with
“Red” Smith’s team setting "a record
of eight wins and one defeat, that
defeat being by the margin of a hair
and the weight of a ﬁnger.

- Beginning with the last Saturday in
September. when Cornell’s hopes fell
victim to the Blue and Gold onslaught,

A . the course of the Varsity machine was

almost without a bump. The game

, with Westminster gave the followers

of the team a chance to see the
eleven in the midst of a slight slump,
but the next week’s win at Annapolis
more than made up for this momen-
tary shock.

Next came the games with Carlisle

. and with, Georgetown, and two more

entries were made in the winning
column. Dickinson was led like a
lamb to slaughter, one week later. W.
& J. gave the Varsity its only back-
set of the season, but the margin be-
tween victory and defeat was so
slight,that there could be little dis-
satisfaction with the team’s perform-
ance. The Tech contest brought with
it signs of poor form, and the ensu-
ing two weeks were spent in resting
up the gladiators for the Turkey Day
battle, which resulted in a glorious
triumph over State, closing the season.

Pitt’s success in football was large-
ly due to the acquisition of several

' new men and the making-over of

others. The team which took the

' ﬁeld in most of the games was quite
different from that of a year before,

though many of the 1913 letter men
were left. The chances taken by the
coaches -in making these shifts were
big, but the results always justiﬁed
them. Among the principal factors
which contributed to victory were the
development of high-class ends in

-Herron and Carlson; the addition of

Hastings, ‘Miller, Hanley, Fry and
others in the backﬁeld; and the mov-
ing of Peck from halfback to center,
which involved the exchange ‘of a
good halfbadk for a world-beating
pivotal performer.

The other prime cause was the al-
most perfect condition of the perform-
ers at the beginning of the season.
Cornell, which established one of the
best records in the East. was defeated
on this point alone; and there was no
‘game in which Pitt’s physical form
did not count.

_._0.._
BASKETBALL.

Beginning the basketball season

~with a squad largely made up of new

men, Pitt’s pace at the opening of the

ﬂoor program was much slower than

at-the ﬁnish. Early defeats handed
Tech, State and Gettysburg helped to
develop the Varsity’s appetite for vic-
tory, and this was increased further

'—‘by triumphs on foreign ﬂoors over
' Lafayette and Rutgers.

Army was
too much for the quintet, Oliphant
proving altogether too strong for the
Pitt defense.

Two games, with Washington &
Jefferson resulted in two more happy
evenings for Pittsburgh fans, partly

 atoning for the defeat by Allegheny.
‘ Tech lost again to Our Own and Juni-

ata fell the second time. The trip to

‘State, however, resulted in a defeat,
A and the two ﬁves went into a tie for

the sectional championship.
This was setled by means of a third

. , game, played at Duquesne Garden,
 wherein Pitt by a lightning-fast ﬁnish
.- took the game and the distr.ict title.
-  All this was but a prelude, however,

to the ﬁnal excitement when Ochsen-
hirt led his warriors against Swarth-
more at Philadelphia, returning with
the Swarthmore scalp and the cup em-
blematic of the State championship.
, With this appropriate close, the
season passed into history as the best
ever, a ﬁt accompaniment of the foot-
ball record. Of the eight who made
up this victorious crew, only two will
not return, and the chances for next
winter are just as bright, if not a
triﬂe more sunlit than were the pros-
sheets a few months back. Pitt’s big
loss is in Captain Ochsenhirt, than

T i whom no better still guard ever lived;

and this, too, though Graham’s form
was the finest ‘of his career. Lubic’s

' I .foul shooting played a large part in
' title-winning, the captain-elect main-

taining an average of something like
.750 on his tries from the chalk mark.

MINOR SPORTS.

Minor sports received the usual at-

’; tention, wrestling and swimming be-
ing the attraction in the winter and

three aggregations, put up a winning

«record, but all were good contenders

CAPTAIN RECOVEBS

Notithe least welcome announce-
ment of this late spring season is the
statement that “Chalky” Williamson,
captain-elect of next fall’s football
warriors, has almost completely, re-
covered from the effects of his’opera-
tion, undergone some months ago.
“Chalky” was out in baseball uniform
last Saturday afternoon, and hurled
the horsehide around "for a -short time
before the W. & J . battle. He looks
as trim and scrappy as ever, and
claims that next fall will be his best.
Having seen Williamson in action in
other years, it’s easy for us to pull
for his dope to comeltrue.

improved upon; but an exceedingly
wet spring, a short schedule and a few
cases of bad management kept the
percentage of victories down. The
outstanding feature of the season was
the double win over Penn State on the
Center countians’ home grounds, this
feat being performed after State had
won 19 out of 21 games played earlier
in the season. Good pitching was a
constant factor in Pitt’s baseball sit-

V uation, but weak hitting was the ﬁy

in the ointment. One cannot but feel
that 1916 will bring rejuvenation to
the diamond forces, and that the tos-
sers will “come through” -in the de-
sired fashion. ‘
__.0__ «

TRACK SUCCESS.

Considerable attention is devoted in
another column to the record of the
track team, especially with regard to
new marks on track and ﬁeld. Six of
the ﬁfteen University records were
fractured during the spring, ‘the two-
mile mark going down twice. The
best individual performances in this
regard were Sheehan’s establishing
the new broad-jump record, beating
his old distance by more than a foot,
and Burwell’s surpassing of Ross’
long-standing record in -the quarter-
mile. Livermore, who lowered the
two-mile time twice, was with Suther-
land the best new man on the Pitt
roster. Sheehan was high scorer for
the team, with Burwell second and
McMaster third. .

Meets were taken from Tech and
W. ‘& J., and lost to State and to Syra-
cuse. The annual /intercollegiate meet.
the big track feature of the year,‘ had
to be called off because of a flooded
track. Already a meet has been sched-
uled with Syracuse in Pittsburgh for
next spring, and other additions may
be made to the cinder-path prograam.

Littleneed be added to the forego-
ing statement. It is quite plain that
Pitt’s path in the future is to be mark-
ed with success, as has been the case
in the past. The ‘requirements as to
eligibility, etc., are becoming more
strict each year, and the athletic: type
tends constantly to ‘improve. ‘The

FRESHMEN wmn up
SUCCESSFUL SEASON

Considering the standing of the
Freshman teams at Pitt, the Univer-
sity year just ended has been a suc-
cess as far as the ﬁrst-year athletics
are concerned. ‘

The autumnal activities of the’Fresh-
man aggregation were under the tute-
lage of Earl F. Ammons, the varsity
full-back of the ’13» team. In this
selection the Freshmen were particu-
larly fortunate, for Ammons is pos-
sessed of a capacity for designing
movements for bodies of men that
would make a Moltke or Napoleon
turn green with envy. Ammons faced
a very difficult proposition. He was
given an aggregation of athletes who
never had played together before and
delegated to pick therefrom a winning
team. This task he accomplished with
consummate skill, considering that it
was his ﬁrst attempt at the coaching
game.

The larger portion of the teams
scheduled by Manager Bradford were
taken into camp by the juveniles.
They succumbed to the rushes of the
representations from Erie and Greens-
burg, but administered a humbling to

gations, besides taking games from
a number of the strong local high
school elevens.

By the end of the season Ammons
had arrived (at the conclusion that
there were sixteen men «upon whom
he might rely to perform favorably
under most conditions and to them
were awarded numerals; they are as
follows: Shapira, Bond, Kendrick,
O’Donnell, Hilty, Connors, Ammons,
Moyer, Ketchum, Riggs, Stahlman,
Meadows, McClelland, Opel, Squires,
and Kavanaugh. Of these Kendrick,
Stahlman, Connors and Hilty are real
Varsity material.

The ﬂoor season proved to. be as
much of a success as had been that of
the Football squad. Under the able
leadership of Landis they met and per-

formed creditably against all of the

quintets they were scheduled to play.

In view of the success of Ammons
as a football coach he was given the
oversight of the Freshman baseball
squad. Carlson, the Bellefonte star of
last year, was made captain and the
season progressed apace. The victor-
ies over Ben Avon and Shadyside were
among the notable accomplishments
of the ﬁrst year tossers, but the really
good work of the team was done
against Indiana and Kiski nines.
Among the men of thissquad Forney,
outﬁelder; McMurray, ﬁrst baseman;
and Kennedy, pitcher; indicate that
they have the true’ baseball talent and
are possible additions to next year’s
Varsity. - ‘

tion has been "made to Pitt Freshman

CRIOOERS CAMP AT

 

The natives of Windber, iPa., are
anxiously awaiting the second week of
September when the husky athletes
of the University of Pittsburgh come

E‘ into their midst to prepare for the

hard schedule that has been prepared
for them. The idea of a pre-season.
training camp has only been a recent
innovation at Pitt, but the success
that attended the work there last fall
has ﬁrmly convinced the athletic
authorities that it is the best course
to pursue. .,

Camp Hamilton, as the place is
known in honor of A. R. Hamilton, ’94,
is situated in the mountains in one of
the most healthy parts of the state.
Far away from the dirt and smoke of
the city,_and living out in the open,
the young athlete has all the oppor-
tunity in the world to get into good
condition. The results in the ﬁrst
games of past seasonsshowed that
Pitt’s men were in far better condition
than were any of their opponents.
This not only wins games but insures
the players to a large degree against
some of the injuries that often arise
from undertraining.

This fall real training will not com-
mence until the second week of Sep-
tember, when for two weeks the men
will be under the watchful eye of the
old fox, Glenn Warner. Then another
week of practice at Forbes Field, and

‘Among the teams that will have
their pictures entered this year are
the Varsity football team which de-
feated Penn State; the basketball team
which conquered both Penn State and
W. & J. inthe series played; also the
Varsity baseball team, winner over
State in the annual series. J. B.
Sutherland by breaking the Univer-
sity Discus throw record is likewise
added. A. R. Livermore set a new
record in the two-mile and his picture
will be among the honored few. Other
record-breakers are Sheehan, Mc-
Master, Burwell and Grumbling, all of
whom were entered on the honor roll
a year ago.

 

on with but one defeat and a total of
thirteen victories, a record which en-
titled the team to the sectional cham-
pionship. Landis, coached this squad,
too, and was instrumental in the vic-
tories scored by his charges. It is
probable that this team will remain
as a Freshman squad as a mere tem-
porary contingency, for it is probable
that it soon will be given a regular
{and merited place in Pitt Varsity ath-
etics. ‘

‘ Any resume of Freshman athletics
under the present regime is confronted
by the fact that little interest is man-
ifested in them outside of the ﬁrst
year class. There can be no real in-
terest in a aggregation," the main ob-
ject of which is to jolly the local high
school teams by giving them some-
thing of a higher repute to try to
defeat. After next year, however, all
will have changed. With the one-year
rule in effect the Freshman teams will
become something of a barometer of
the next year’s Varsity strength and
then ﬁrst-year athletics will enter a
new interest-commanding era.

the men will be ready for the first
game of the season. A new idea to
be tried this year is to have the
Freshman football team practice on
the same ﬁeld with the Varsity. This
will enable closer observation of the
ﬁrst-year men and will also allow the
new men to see what the Varsity is
doing. , This is the system used at
many of the leading colleges and uni-
versities and works well.

Most of last years Varsity men will
again report for the team this year.
The number lost by graduation this
year is relatively smaller than it has
been for several seasons. “Chuck”.
Reese the husky'guard will be back
in school again this fall and will
probably be out again. About six or
seven of "last year’s Freshman squad
will be taken up to camp this fall.
The ones chosen will be informed
later. Besides these, there are quite
a few prep school athletes in this vi-
cinity who will be given a chance to
show their mettle. This is the last
year the Freshmen will be eligible for
Varsity teams, the one-year rule tak- _
ing effect in 1916. '

NEW COACH PLANS
FOR COMING SEASON

Coach Warner has ordered “tents up”
for the second week in next Septem-
ber; and with this call every student
realizes that September isn’t far off.
Warner is spending the summer at
his home in New York State, where he
is plotting Pitt’s 1915 campaign, which
will be one of the most rigorous in
history. With eighteen or nineteen
Varsitymen returning to school, and
with the additions sure to bemade to
the squad, prospects are bright for a

real winner [under the new guide.
