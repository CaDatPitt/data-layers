  Chancellor Testifies

Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld, testifying as chairman of
the Governmental Affairs Institute, urged the federal govern-
ment to continue its support of the Leaders Exchange Program
atia House Foreign Alfairs subcommittee meeting last Tues-

The Exchange Program, being examined as part of a st_udy

’ ‘to determine “whether the United States has an over—all strate-

igy for employing ideological weaponsto win the cold war,”.

involves reciprocal visits between governmental, professional,

and business leaders of the'United States and other countries,
with slightly more emphasis on foreign visits to this ‘country.

Litchﬁeld himself helped establish this program in postwar,

Germany when ‘the need became apparent for Germany’s new
leaders to examine American methods.
Decision Makers
“From a practical point of view, the inﬂuence of these
exchange leaders dates from the day they step off the plane at
home,” the Chancellor said. He described the leaders who
participate as “the present decision—makers” of their countries.
Over 5000 such leaders. have already come to this country
since the start of the program. _ _ ,

. Litchﬁeld stressed the importance ‘of choosing the par-
ticipants of the program wisely to make sure that they are
from the groups whose leadership is most needed in the
foreign countries. They should include engineers and eco-
nomic planners, he recommended, for too_often the maJor-
ity of participants are military men of narrow interests

He suggested that follow-up visits be planned and, that
private organizations bear more of the costs. Despite, the fact
that the United States has not paid for pa lot of the travel,
hefeels that higher contributions by foundations and other

. private brganizations would underline the difference between
our program and the Soviet Union’s.

Co-ordination -of the many federal exchange and informa-
tion programs in order to prevent duplication would also con-
tribute to the improvement of our over—all program.

Theformer Pep for Pitt-com-

Meredith.

Meredith, ﬁrst Negro to be graduated from’ the Univer- ,4

sity of Mississippi, accepted an invitation to speak at the

series when informed of Rev.

King’s cancellation. He will''_

discuss “Crisis in Race Relations.” '

The 30-year-old Mississippi native was the key ﬁgure 
in a national crisis evolving fromo '

an attempt to integrate the Ole!
Miss campus. Soliciting the as-
sistance of the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of
Colored People, Meredith -won a
court ﬁght and the right to attend
classes at the University’s Oxford
campus in October, 1962. He trans-
ferred from Jackson State College
(Miss.), a Negro institute.

Bearing the brunt of ridicule
and continual threats "on his life,
Meredithunaintained, “I was sure
that- if Iwere killed, somebody
else would take my place’ some-
day.‘ I do what I do because I

His aim to receive a B.A. at
Ole Miss has been realized. Now
he is thinking of enrolling in
law school in Washington, D.C.,
next year. His wife will be a
graduate student this fall at
Howard University (D.C.).'

Meredith. insists that "he has
tried to remain detached, objec-

troubles posed in the struggle for

' The comparison of fraternity
QPA to the “all mens” QPA is
misleading, Bebko said. In . the

An increasing academic

’Despite these negative aspects,

In The Spotlight

Currently on View in American
movie houses are three of the
finest cinema talents extant in
three of their most interesting
motion pictures, Paul Newman,
J a c k Lemmon and Marcello
Mastroianni.

Paul“ Newman, late of Shaker
Heights, Northwestern and Yale
Drama‘ School, is in the south

‘again (i.e. Texas). He is playing,

his usual rebellious self in the
role of a heartless, selﬁsh stag,
who spits in society’s eyes and hits
the target every time. Nothing has
clearly changed in Newman’s rise

‘to the peak of the American Un-

dershirt School of Acting.
In “Hud,” ' the rebel drives a,
pink _'Cadillac convertible (the
picture is in black and white,’
but we are told that the Caddie
is pink), drinks six-packs. like
they were going out of style,
and tries to seduce every skirt
within seducing distance.

Hud ‘is a wise-cracking ego-
maniac who bears a striking re-
semblance to Eddie Felson, Chance
Wayne and Ben Quick. If those
characters sound familiar then you

truly. All are rebellious, wise-
cracking, cock-‘sure and_ heartless
aliens from society and are the
main characters of “The Hustler,”
“Sweet Bird of Youth,” and “The
Long, Hot Summer.”

Newman’s Hud is, the ﬁnest

piece of cinemacting so "far this '

year and the ‘picture is as tough,
honest and striking as Newman
himself. A . ’
While, Paul Newman is con-
stantly at war with the ‘movie-_
goer, thereseems to be a love saf-
fair on thepart of -the public with
Jack Lemmon. Harv’ard’s gift to
ﬁlmdom can currently be seen in
“Irma La Douce,” a dissappointing
version of a comedy that was ‘be-
guiling andbubbly as a musical on

the stage. But no concern of ours
is the movie. Lemmon is the star
and he can do no wrong.

Perhaps the finest all around
talent on the screen, Lemmon’s
facial grimances of pain, sur-
prise, thought, naivte’ and his
exquisite double takes and gog-
gles have endeared the actor to,
the public. _

‘The Anniversary’

By NANCY DELANEY
Even a little slapstick is a dan-
gerous thing — but a very little
can be funny. It can be, that is,
if it’s likegthe Pitt Players’ pre-
sentation of Chekovfs The Anni-
versary last Thursday evening: a
CAPITALIZED comment on the
‘insanity of life's lower case in-
cidents that come to a period after
a half hour or less. »
In this one act play, the little
gray-haired bookkeeper, dis-
gusted with the incessant chat-
tering of the boss’s wife, chased
her three times ‘around the room
with a feather duster before ev-
eryone ﬁnally bumped into each
other and passed out on the

none-the-‘less.

The high, cracking voice and
hunched-over back of the book-
keeper, Kuzma,-were staged with
humor and precision by- Richard
Zirke. When ' Zirke waved his
feather duster, crying, “Out, out!”
he was laughed at, not because
Zirke was funny, but because
Zirke was Kuzma.

Knew the Character
William H. Kingsley, playing
Audrey Andreyevitch Shiputchin,
Kuzma’s boss in a Russian bank,
knew the character he was playing
“as sure as my name's, Shiput-
chin.” And for the duration of the
play, it was. - “

Kingsley, who also directed the
play, bounced as he walked, and

and raised his eyebrows, and

Prof. Schwartz Heads Program

Professor Meyer Schwartz of the Univerhityls Graduate School of Social Work has

' been appointed director of a‘nation”al research program to ﬁnd the -best way to educate

professional community workers in the prevention and control of juvenile delinquency.
The appointment was rnade by the Council on Social Work Education and approved
by the President’s Committee-‘on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime. -
The program will operate under a grant from the Department of Health, Education,

and .Welfare, in cooperation with¢

the President’s Committee.
Stimulate National Efforts
It is expected to‘ stimulate ‘na-
tional. efforts -to provide commu-
nities W i t h broadly—educated

,workers who can-‘ help them plan

and carry out services to combat
juvenile delinquency, according to
the information released by the
University’s Public Relations De-

, partment.

According to Schwartz, head
of the ‘University's q graduate‘
program in Community Organi-
zation, “We know that juvenile
delinquency has multiple causes.
Poor housing, unemployment,
family status, and a person’s
expectations about life are in-
terrelated factors that have to
be dealt with.” '

He feels that the President’s
Committee is aware of this and
believes that the nation doesn’t

have enough" trained social work-

ers to handle any solution large
enough to be '-really effective.
, Hopes‘ To Enlarge‘ Group
By comparing‘ ‘what "community
workers face ‘on the job with what’
they learned in the classroom, he
hopes to» improve their training,
and to enlarge their numbers.
. Aided by, consultants at other
‘. universities, Schwartz intends to
carry on his ‘teaching duties.
Administrative work on the
project will be handled in New
York by a staff person from the
Council on Social Work Educa-
tion, ’ -
.Schwartz’s‘ associates will be:
Dr. Stanley »Budner of Columbia
University, chief research consult-
ant; Professor Arnold Gurin of

, When placed into the fraternity mould —— even though
-discriminatory clauses have all but disappeared from na-
tional and local charters — we ﬁnd people joining groups
containing members almost solely of their own race or
religion. A true mixing of cultures for the betterment of
the individual is almost non—existent.
What remains, then, is a system with ideals of brother-

Butin the age of the individual, it is simply not enough.
Only when the fraternity system here at the University

The People's

The Right to Discriminate.  ..

    

Choice

That one last question at the “What About the -

Greeks” forum on September“6 was the hot one
the. panel had anticipated and most of the audi-

ence hoped someone else would ask: “So what_

about discrimination « in the
fraternity system?”

And Greek Gussie Smith
explained calmly into the mike
that her group had, in effect.
chosen to discriminate at least
since she had been at-ﬁliated
but 'were certainly not bound
by any national or chapter pol
icy with such a clause. '

Indeed, no student organi-
zation with such a discrimina-
tory provision would be able W
to stay a part of the University after Jan. 1, 1965.

This ‘germ could have blossomed ‘ into the
brawl scene moderator Bernard Adams spoke of
in his introduction when he displayed the punch
of ‘his elbows andeffective length of his arms for
breaking up any ﬁghts between opponents. But
the cafeteria was open for dinner already and the
discussion disbanded. I

Out of that whole nebulous discussion, that
one idea that Gussie threw out stuck with me.

For this same right she spoke of,.that freedom
to select diﬂ’erent kinds or the same kind, that
status Q110 at the University which will be legally
enforced in 1965, was cited in a recent pamphlet
as inevitably destroying the fraternal system. ~ W
Appeal from Pasadena '

This appeal against a similar anti-discrimina-
tion ruling was printed by the Pasadena Con-
ference, a group of national and international
fraternities and sororities in the interest of the
Greek system in California.

In a sense, this Pasadena Conference foresees
indiscrimination rather than non-discrimination,

   

' the end of that right to select. It declares: _

“Such restrictions on the right of individuals
to associate freely, within limitations of their own
choosing, and to seek to achieve homogeneity of
membership through common ideals and interests,
are not consistentwith the best. principles of
democracy.” , ’

This whole statement, of fallacy, in a sense

calling freedom restriction, seems unaware of the
two types of discrimination — the bad which the
system had to get rid of, the good which it
still maintains. .
There was a discussion of individual choice
in the Ohio State University Monthly last spring

which viewed “man’s innate predeliction to choose

his closest companions.” Fraternities and sorori-
ties have evolved from this
selection. Just as man chooses his best friend be-
cause of common interests, common purpose,
common views of the world, justas he chooses his
mate, so a fraternal system extends this into an
organized "group... ' B

‘ To Choose a Friend

A The fraternity man is choosing his friends, and
so, literally is discriminating because he is’ pick-
ing one and not another. _ , '

But this kind of discrimination all men do,
Greek or independent, college students, kids with

- a nickel for candy, or the country club set. We

cannot possibly say that choosing_ an individual

on his merits is bad. Indeed, as that Ohio State

article points out, the whole purpose of education

is to teach one to be discriminating —- to know .

what music we like, what books, and, in truth,
what people. '

Then that word is crudely extended to apply
to dis'eriminatin'g between groups, man choosing
not on individual merit, but judging by carica-
ured generalizations. And here it is that the
process has gained its distorted, connotation.

Laws such as the one in California and the
one issued by our own school_are merely elimi-

, nating the unfairness of that last distortion. In-

deed, the right to choose individuals is extended
by removing the race and religious barrier. ,

The groups are still in control‘ of their choices
—— not being allowed to discriminate_is not the
same thing as having ‘to take in‘ certain people.
They will still be discriminating in its true sense
—- naturally between individuals, not indiiferently
between groups. B A

This Pasadena Conference does not have a
logical argument‘ because the groups are more
than ever “within the limits of their own choos-
ing” and, whichever way it goes, that choice is
democratic. '

Varsity Capers

Law and order ﬁnally prevails at Varsity’ Hall.
It has never been there before.

‘Captain Ray and hislburgeoning University
police force have‘ moved in, and things should
prove pretty dull for. the old
building.\ . - ' ,

In 1 case you i don’t know,
Varsity Hall is that two-story
building out behind the Sta-
dium, the one slowly sinking
into‘ an abandoned coal mine.
It was built in 1912 and.it may

plenty of hamburgers, who -
have lived there since.

Up until this year it has
been a housing unit of the athletic department.
They. used to keep the freshmen football teams
there until they bought Schenley Hall.

Then they‘ turned it over to. the wrestlers,
trackmen and a few football players that were
tax write-'offs. Itthas been known by such names
as ‘The Animal House,” and “The Zoo.”

When the Storm Broke

It was during the stay oftheifrosh football
players that allihell broke loose in Varsity Hall.

Some of the youthfultoughs, far away from
the eyes and ears of any disciplinarians, used to
climb in the windows after 11 p.m. so they
wouldn’t arouse a grad student who dozed near
the main door and posed as a counselor. Some of
the Mickey Spillane types just put their shoulders
to the doors and proved they could knock some-
thing over. _

Always alert for a new gag to hearten the
dreary penthouse, they’d stuff the pillows with

 

fresh eggs. And the victims would get revenge‘

by spreading mustard under the ‘sheets of his
friend. ‘

Rock and roll shows were the big things a
few years ago at Syria Mosque. The players used
to go down and terrorize the crowd, and then

By Jim O'Brien

The best gag at Animal" Farm in the last
decade backﬁred into an even .better gag. Some
of the tenants in one end of the building decided
to scare the guys in the other wing. , ‘

They kept their plot a secret ‘for afew ‘days
before carrying it out.‘ Then one night a few fel-
lows slippedout the back door and disappeared
into the hillside.

A few moments later these same rogues were
sashaying about the cemetery behind Varsity Hall
cloaked in’ spooky white bed sheets.. But, aha,
there was a counterplot. I ‘

As they zig-zagged about the headstones, sud-
denly _they saw bodies rising from the mounds

the boys from the other side of Varsity Hall
had a good laugh. '

on the other guy.”

Now all of the football players live in the new
dormitory towers, complete with ﬂoor counselors

-here and there, elevators with intercoms that can

be returned to the mail ﬂoor upon hearing any

New Adviser to ,Druids

By PATRICK A ANTHONY

Executive Committee of Druids
has named Jack B. Critchﬁeld, di-
rector of student aid, advisor to
the group. The announcement

,,/_ comes as a pleasant surprise to

many closely associated with
Druids as well as to its new ad-
viser.

“I am certainly honored. sur-
prised and pleased to be asked to

serve in the capacity of adviser to f

Druids,” he remarked.

Critchﬁeld succeeds N. Ronald
Pease, former adviser to Druids

.— and now Dean of Men at West-

minster College.

Honorary Member

Druids, a sophomore and junior
male activities leadership honor-
ary, tapped Critchﬁeld as an hon-
orary member in 1960. At that
time he was University assistant
director of admissions.

.He began his administrative
work at the University in Feb-
ruary, 1959, when he was ap-
pointed assistant in admissions
and financial aid.

,After receiving his M.A. from
the University in August, 1960,
Critchﬁeld was named assistant
director of admissions and served
in that capacity until June, 1961.

Took Year’s Leave

Following a year’s absence in
order to accept a position at West-
zminister, he returned to the Uni-
versity in August, 1962, and be-
came director of student aid, the
post he now‘ holds.

The likeable, young admini-
stra-tor is working toward a doc-
torate in higher education ad-
ministration, which he hopes to
complete in 1964.

“I don’t believe it’s an adviser’s
duty to run the show in any ‘or-
ganization,” Critchﬁeld s a'i d.
“Druids is an organization of stu-

underclassmen with
and incentive needed to partici-

JACK B. CRITCHFIELD “
“Honored, .S‘ufrprised . . . Pleased’

dent leaders and they can do the
most good without outside inter-
ference.”

Act As Buffer

He added that he would act as’
a “buffer” between the student

organization and the administra— '
Ation, expressing an eagerness to

assist the group

in matters of
counsel. "

Officers of Druids are: Joseph
Seiger, president; Alan Seijas,
vice president; Alan Schlosser,
‘recording secretary; John Vrana,
corresponding secretary, and
Warren Cohn, treasurer.

Plans for the term include four
luncheons, a general tapping meet-
ing and an activities "counseling
service for underclassmen. The
latter, a new program'instituted
by Druids, is designed to provide
information

pate in activities.

are our strongest points. Weseems to be real
good personnel wise at these positions.”

With three letter winners at center and

six at guard the coach has just cause for his ..

optimism. His hopes aren’t as high for the rest
of the line, but there is not a trace of pessimism
in his voice as his talks of his tackles and ends.
“After Ernie Borghetti and John l\/laczuzak
our tackles are inexperienced,” Michelosen said.
“But the new boys have showed enthusiasm
and desire to play. If they can keep this attitude
up during the entire season_l feel our tackle
situation will be adequate.” .
Despite six lettermen returning at end the
position remains one of the ‘major question
marks of the team. None of the terminals have

_ displayed the consistent all-around ability that

until recently was a hallmark of Panther teams.

Michelosen said, “We have ﬁve senior ends
who h.ave been learning for two years. We are
hopeful that this year they will come into
their own.”

The caliber of ends in recent years has
been one of the reasons for a weak passing at-
tack. Not since Ivan Toncic called signalshave

the Panthers mustered a feared passing attack.

Another reason is the team has not come up

with a quarterback of Toncic’s stature. _
Michelosen is hopeful that this is the ‘year.
“We have three boys (Fred Mazurek, Kenny
Lucas and Fran Novak) who have been work--
ing well at quarterback,” l\/Iichelosen said. “It’s

. been a real pleasure the way the boys have

been passing and catching.”

The backﬁeld, according to Michelosen,
“has two well balanced units with men capable
of going all. the way at any time.” The coach
said, “The move of Paul Martha to left halfback
seems tobe a good one. He appears very much
at home there. Rick Leeson is bigger and
stronger this year.”

UCLA will be a worthy opponent. Accord-
ing to Michelosen they have 126 men to choose
from; a 55 man varsity and 71 redshirts. With
this type of selection UCLA coach Bill Barnes

Scrubs Thrashed in Scrimmage

By AL BL’UlV[KIN'

The Panther football team
went through its last rehearsal
for the 1963 season Saturday
with a full—scale scrimmage

at Gateway High School in

Monroeville.
The ﬁrst three units ganged up

' on the fourth and ﬁfth units as

Coach John Michelosen again
stressed offensive patterns against
UCLA defensive formations.

The scrimmage was held in
Monroeville because Trees Field
is too small and ground crew sup-
erintendent H o r s e Czarnecki
would not permit the gridders to
chew up the Stadium sod. V

Quarterbacks Under Wraps

Michelosen kept his. _quarter-

, backs under wraps. Unlike last
week’s scrimmage at the Stadium

the quarterbacks ‘u s e d fairly
stereotyped plays.
' The ﬁrst three units, called
the “Whites,” squashed the
Blues or UCLA team, 39-0. The
ﬁrst unit scored three times. the
second scored twice, and the
third unit tallied once. .
Fred Mazurek, the starting
quarterback, threw two touch-
down passes, a 24-yarder to half-
back John Ozimek, and a 3-yard
ﬂip to end Al Grigaliunas.'Ma-
zurek also ran for a 28-yard
touchdown.
Lucas Leads Drive
Kenny Lucas also starred. The
sophomore drove the second unit
88 yards for a score. He passed
for most of the ﬁrst seventy yards,
before switching to _a ground at-
tack. Fullback John Telesky ﬁn-
ally barreled overvfrom the one" to
post the touchdown.
I c The ﬁfth touchdown came -‘on_
7 1.,» -’-"1 l .‘.1'

a four-yardrun by Bob Roeder
after a completion. from Lucas
to Bill Howley and a pass from
Eritc Crabtree to Lucas on the
quarterback eligible play. The
final score was posted by the
third unit as a result of an 11-
yard gallop by halfback Dale
Stewart. .

There were two casualties dur-
ing the rugged workout. .First-
string center Paul Cercel jammed
the big toe on his right foot and
left the ﬁeld for x-rays. If the
toe is broken, Cercel could be lost
to the team for as long as six
weeks. Halfback ‘Dale Stewart
reopened the cut he suﬁered last
week and had to have stitches
taken again.

But Likes to Play Both Ways  

 By MARV zmmowrrz

Ray Popp, Panther left
guard, prefers defense to of-
fense. Both he and guard

coach, Steve Petro, agree that
his preference is reﬂected in
his better performance on

"It’s like defense is more fun,”
Popp said. “There’s much , more
-to it. On offense, you know be-
fore a play starts exactly what,
you are supposed to do. On de-
fense you have to watch the
guards all the time. They tell
you what you have to do. They
almost always give the play
away at the snap of the ball.”

Popp’s chair creakedunder his

. 210 pounds as he leaned forward to
further elaborate. “On offense,
the guards have to take it. They
can’t do anything but block. De-

Three Teams Hold Lead

,In Fraternity Softball Loop

The defending champions Phi‘Epsilon Pi started where
they left off last year by trouncing Sigma Chi 11-4 and edging
Zeta Beta Tau, 9-6. Pitcher Bob Schacter, the winner in
both games, also did some lusty hitting in the first game

_with a homer and a double. Second baseman Dave Hoff-
man led the attack in the ZBT game with a three hit splurge.
Pi Lambda Phi, last year’s run-°

1"-‘nerup, displayed a potent offense

in winning their two games. They
defeated Sigma Alpha Mu, 11-4
Tuesday and humiliated Sigma
Chi, 25-2, Wednesday.
Lasky Leads Hitting _
Rich Lasky and Fred Berlin

homered to lead Pi Lam over the .

Sammies and Carl Del Villagio,
with "a homer,’ and -Lasky, with

«-‘ﬁve hits, paced the Pi Lam on-

' .slaught on sigma . Chi. Stu Patz_

was the winning pitcher in both
games.

The Delta Sigs also kept pace
by downing ZBT 8-1 and top-
-ping the Sammies 3-2. John
Pignetti and Hank Bomberger
had two homers each as the
Delta Sigs scored all their runs
on homers, hitting eight.

The Sammie game was the
same for the Delts Sigs as all
their runs werescored on homers.
Pignetti hit one and Ralph Cappy
contributed the other with a man
on base.

Football-like Scores

Only two games have been
played in the “B” league and
Delta Tau Delta and Phi Kappa
Alpha share the lead. Both games
resulted in football-like scores as

~crrors and hits were featured in

each game.

The Delts led by l5 runs go-
ing into the next last‘ inning,
but Sigma Alpha Epsilon came
back for 115 runs in the last two
innings to almost overtake them.
The Delts, however, were scor-
ing ﬁve times in the last two
frames.

Jack Coury led the Delts with

—~ isix hits all singles and "John Gil-

fol-
lowed with three and a home run
apiece.

Held Out Last Year _

The junior guard, who was
h.eld out of action last year due
to an injury, was running with
the first unit until he pulled a
muscle in his "right knee. “Any
someone gets hurt,
‘drop ‘to about the third team,”
Popp explained. “That’s only fair.
After all, why should a guy who
is hurt ‘work out with the best
unit?”

“Now I have to work my way

back up to the starting team.”
Although Popp is injured, the
left guard position is still‘
strong, according to Petro.
“Jeﬁi Ware and Bernie La-
Quinta are both good boys. But
with Popp hurt, we’re not as
strong as we were before.”

“It would be nice to have all
our guards healthy for the UCLA
game,” Petro said. ,

Popp feels the same way. He
placed his hand on his injured
knee. “I hope I’m ready for the
opening game,” he said. “UCLA
is supposed to be good this year.”

Then he,turned his attentions
to the football team in general.
“I think we’re improved over
last year,” he said. “We have
more ‘experience, and there is
more spirit on the team. I think

’ we’ll be pretty good.”
