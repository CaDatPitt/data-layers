Business Gain 3

Business in the Pittsburgh district
continued its advance last week but
at a slower rate than in the preced-
ing week, according to the Univer-

Sity Bureau Of Business..Research.. ..-sder; the sponsorship of the Allegheny’

The bureau’s index of general
business rose to 120.9 per cent of
the 1923-25 average, a gain of 2.5‘
points over the week ending Octo-
ber 14.

Many of the major industries are
nearing capacity in their operations,
and the usual seasonal peak in some
industries has passed. Therefore,‘
some let-down in activity in coming
weeks would be in line wth past ex-
perience, the Bureau reports.

Coal producton and river traffic de-
clined, but rail shipments increased
to new high levels for the year. De- ’
partment store sales declined some-
what less than seasonally while new
motor car registrations were above
normal. ‘

This conference, the ﬁrst of the
year, is open to both men and W0-
men, is part of the program‘ of the
vocational guidance committee of
WSGA. The committee, under the‘
direction of Elizabeth Richards, Ed41,

will address Un.iversit_V students
today at 12 :30 0"(3lo(.*l{ in Stephen
Foster Memorial Hall on the sub-
ject of “Central European Cur-
rents that Lead to War.”

Dr. Jan Papanek, special secretary
to Dr. Eduard Benes, is scheduled to
speak to the student assembly. Fol-
lowing this meeting, Dr. Papaneklwill
discuss with members of the faculty
in the dining. room of the Faculty
club the part which the Czechoslovak
people are playing in support of the
Allies in the present war.

University Speaker ,

Last evening Dr. Papanek spoke to
a mass meeting of Czechoslovaks in
the Pittsburgh district staged in com-
memoration of the twenty—ﬁrst anni-

versary of the independence of
Czechoslovak republic.
Previously, he has spoken three

times at University functions, last
October at a meeting of district his-
tory instructors, at the dedication of
the Czechbslovak room in the Cathe-
dral and at the opening Inquiry
Forum discussion last October. ,

At this meeting last year, Dr.
Papanek spoke on “The European
Crisis” and made this prophetic state-
ment, “We will see that the bill
Czechoslovakia paid will not be. for
peace, but merely, for a postpone-
ment, to a later conflict.” He went on
to say that his country was betrayed,
but not broken, and then gave a‘de-
tail.ed account of the history, cul-
tural achievements and international
relations of Czechoslovakia.
Consul in Pittsburgh

Dr. Papanek was born in Brezova
pod Bradlom, Czechoslovakia, and
drafted into the Austro-Hungarian
army in 1915. He was one of the».
first organizers of the Czech Legions.-.
in Italy, and edited the Legion’s news‘-
paper, V Boj, during 1918 and 19195”
in Italy.

He has had much experience 
diplomatic service, beginning as com-
mercial attache in Budapest. He
moved from there to the position of
commercial. secretary in Washington,
and then served in the ministry of
foreign affairs in Prague. Dr. Papa-,
nek was appointed consul in Pitts-
burgh in 1935, and served in this ca-
pacity until he became Dr. Benes’
secretary last November. He is now
the official head of Czechoslovak af-

fairs while Dr. Ben-es is in London. A

Inquiry .l5‘<.n:um. _ _ '

through  tcrriﬁ-c depression, a revolution in polit-

to one that o-ccurs'whilc a.nothcr»wa1° is on.

But for Dr. Barnes and for the Univcrs‘ity, this
ten years is different in another way. The last
time he came to speak he was forced off campus
and had ‘to speak on a- parking lot on Bayard
street. For conducting this 1ucetl.ng two’ students
were expelled from school., and in the resulting
.agitatlo:n. an instructor was dismissed. Suit was
brought ag:=.lI1st the University by the Civil Lib-
erties Union. and the American Association of Uni-
versity Professors made a report of condemnation.

For the last time Dr. Barnes spoke here was at
the time of the famous “Liberal Club”..i11ciclent in
1929.

’l‘cu Vvc-2.1's is 31 long time and few remember the
details, but the downtown papers and the New

Club had 2:: University charter to conduct meetings.
for unprcju(liced discussion and open inquiry. The
week before Dr. Barnes was to speak a leaﬂet came
out on campus calling for the pardon of Mooney
and Billiiigs. Presumably this paper was from the

Conc.calin,e; this fact from the faculty advisory
board, Arthur McDowell, ’32, and ‘William Albert-
son, ’31, rcpI'escnti11"g the club, got the board ’s. per-
mission to have Dr. Barnes speak on the Mooney-
Billings case.

The University, in the person’ of Bill Daufcn-
bach, forbade any attempt at meeting on -campus,
and after two attempts to do so, the group ﬁnally
had to ‘take the audience of 75 students and 25
faculty people down to the parking lot wherc»Dr.
Barnes spoke from the running board of a car.

For the whole affair, McDowell and Albertson
were expelled. from school. It was never clearly
stated why Frcclc1'ick \Vol.tman, instructor in phil-
osophy, was dismissed at this time too. He did not
belong to the club, but was only a sympathizcr.
His charge that he was dismissed because of activi-
ties as secretary of the American Civil Liberties

lnion, and bccallse of an article condemning the
coal. and iron police was never publicly refuted.

‘But his connection with the Liberal Club was
never cstnl.‘»lisl’1e<l. The Civil Liberties Union. re-
tained lleimv Ellenbogen, now judge of the Com-
mon Pleas, to defend the two stlldcnts and to have
them reinstated. The courts refused reinstatement;
and the B<:r»ar~:l of Trustees upheld the expulsion.
Among‘ the inicrcstiiig questions tliat Albertson
had to answer in his defense before the board was
one i.n<{uirlng  to whether coliiimmlsts had the
right to go to s.:-hool. There was no statement in
the ipapcrs as to what this had to do with the case.

J The Aincrlcan Association of l’n.'ivcrsit._v Profes-
sors sent .l‘)r. George Sabine and Dr. Alexander
Wittke of Ohio State to the University to make an
investig'at,i<.in. ..Pointing out that they could have
no quarrel with the University’s right to discipline
the students for their actions, they did say, in their
report, however, that the grounds for that action
wereaopen to co*nde-lmnation. A simlilar appeal had

Common Sense .
By ‘Senator’ Ziskind
Colonel Lindbergh will .80 down in history "as the
greatest aviator and diplomatic blunderer of‘“=al‘l~ time:
The Colonel, as you know, has darted out of his seclu-
sion long enough to deliver two radio addresses on

to hiding and camera dodging. His ﬁrst Speech, of
course, ‘was splendid‘ ‘because it reechoed, in beautifully
written Anne Morrow phraseology, man’s righteous con-
tempt for warand .the duty of Western Civilization to
carry the torch of freedom. .

In his second address, however, when he took a
stand on controversial political issues, he spoke as a
second rate Congressman from Podunk. He took 5 it
upon himself, here, to redlvide the British Empire, in-
corporating Canada into the vast boundaries of the
United States. ‘He spoke derisively of our Canadian

~ neighbor because she considered herself a part of the
British Empire and declared war upon Germany.
Cénada, he insisted, is endangering our peace since
we have sworn ‘to ‘defend the Western hemisphere
from alien attack. . , _

The poor, bewildered Colonel was swamped with
tworld protest and resentment." The fact that he accept-
ed a gold. medal from the Nazi Governmentwas imme-
dlately seized upon as an_ explanation of his curious ex-I
pressions. “Dorothy Thompson—who thinks that the
present lwar ‘is a personal affair between herself and
Herr I-Iitl"er——Walter Lippmann, and Mrs__. Roosevelt—tore_
the Co1oné1’s words to shreds, and mercilessly, through
‘the application of cold logic, reduced his speech to a
state of super absurdity. . .

.But I, for one, shall refrain from expressing shock

or abhorrence over the Colonel’s remarks. Rather I
should satisfy myself on the knowledge ‘alone that it
was the Colonel, The Great Aviator speaking-—not an
international expert. And soothed with philosophical
pleasantry, I should rest at ease, for I should be ob-
serving 3. resubstantiation of Plato’s great thesis of
' the division of’ labor: Let each man do the thing for
which he is best adapted and let untouched the, things

Pit‘t"’s ‘towering mights of a basket-
ball team are sprucing up for the
coming season, Should anyone wan-
der into the domains of Pitt,Stadiu’m’s
ﬂoor, they would ﬁnd a very serious
group of young -athletes, putting the
old “college —try”" in“.all their scrim-
niages.

;“'Doc” Carlson’s “sophomore glam-
our boys” are now juniors, somewhat
wiser and perhaps, a bit better, point-
ing toward the coming season with
but one incentive. Their fondest de-
sire is to improve on last year’s
medioc1'e, if not poor, record of wins
and losses. As a secondary motive,
they wish to restore some of the
cheerful doctcr’s hair, and his famous
nickname c-f"‘Win ’em all.” i

All of the ex-sophomores but two
are back in the Pitt fold, Larry Pati-
rath and Al Reeves, the absentees.
Returning to aid the “Doc” are S.tral-
oski, Port, Kocheran, Milanovich,
Klein, Pataky and Vujnovic. Other
jacket wearers returning are seniors
Johnson and Scherer.

Several new faces“ can --be seen cut—}
ting capers around ‘the hardwood.
Charley Ptacek, one of the most bril-
liaant players this district has pro-
duced, will display his wares for the
ﬁrst time this year. The ex-Con-
nelly Trade star coached the success-
ful freshman team last year in the,
absence of “Doc” Zehfuss. 3

Four of last years highly touted
freshman cagers are delivering the
ball through the hoop with regular-
ity. They are Ziolkowski, Egan, Col-
lins and Levin, the same boys that
gave early birds at the Stadium court
such ﬁne exhibitions.

The team is rapidly approaching
prime condition, ready and rarin’ to
sink their fangs into hapless oppo-
nents. They are a big, fast, and rug-
ged group of athletes. On paper,
they look as potentially great as they
did last year at this time.

Ptacek will stabilize the ﬁve with
his cool, clean passing and his smooth
defensive play. The Panther never
lacked offensive skill; at times, they
were uncanny. In fact, they won

ilvlorgantown, VV. Va., October 29.
-Figures do sometimes lie, if the
25-0 defeat handed the Pitt fresh
gridders by the West Virginia year-
lings yesterday may ,—be taken as an
example. ' _  , . ii
The freshmen played good ball and
didn’t deserve to lose by more than
one touchdown. They exhibited a
strong defense, and while the attack
was not especially ‘powerful, it was
considerably better than that shown,
against.Penn State in the ﬁrst year-
ling game. ‘
Long punts due to a stiff wind
blowing through the open end of

Mountaineer ﬁeld marked a-scoreless ~

ﬁrst half. The Mountaineers had the
wind at their backs in the initial
quarter, forcing the little Panthers

to stave off repeated onslaughts. In A

the second quarter, Pitt began a 56
yard drive on its own 22, but lost the
ball on a fumble. ‘

West Virginia tallied twice in the
third period. On the second play
following the recovery of a Pitt ‘fum-
ble, Fryer raced 55 yards for a
touchdown. A line buck try for the
extra point was not good. i

A quick kick by Fryer bounced
crazily’--out of bounds on the, Pitt
one yard line just before the end
of the third quarter. "West Virginia

, blocked ‘Saksa’s attempt to kick out

and recovered on the one. Lassak

carried -the ‘ball over, but the try

for ’-the extra point was blocked.

Pitt engineered a 40 yard drive in
the last period, featured by a 20
yard pass from Malloy to Klotz, but
lost the ba-ll on downs on the enemy
30. Interceptions of passes thrown
by Pitt reserves paved the way for
13 West Virginia points in the ﬁnal
quarter. .-

A Mountaineer interception, fol-
lowed by a pass from Fryer to Nar-
ick, scored the third Mountaineer six-
pointer. The try for the extra mark-
er failed. Hackney tallied from the
one-foot line in the ﬁnal minute of
play, after a 45 yards run-backlof an
intercepted pass by Mangus. Ham-
ilton place—kickeci the ﬁnal point.

Bob Malloy, Walt Wascovich, John-
ny Gurczenski, and Larry Klotz play-
It is im-
possible to pick out an individual
Pitt star, but the entire ﬁrst string, as
well as several reserves, gave ﬁrst-S
rate performances. Tex Hinte was
the acting captain for the Panther

acquaint both salespeople anad cus-
tomers with useful information
about merchandise. The set includes
twenty-six pocket-size booklets in
outline form.

possible peace,. a peace which the
editors of the Weekly thought" could
not be brought about because to bring
it about there would :01’ necessity have

to be loss of honor on one sideor then
other.‘ "The""Chfis‘tfiias”7e”ditofi'al’ “on”

the war said, “Belligerents and neu-

trals, military men and book worms,‘

labor andcaptains of commerce, all
are weary of ﬁghting, and would ac-
cept peace with alacrity if they could
do so without ‘compromising their
own or their fatherland’s honor.”

There was, further, a note of
pessimism for the future success of
any Hague tribunal. The editorial
continued, “The supreme lesson of
the past sixteen months consists in
the nulliﬁcation of the principles
which lay at the foundation of the
Hague Tribunal. Never again will a
voluntary federation under the pres-
ent system of armaments produce
practical results in the arbitration of
international disputes.”

As a solution to the problem, they
agreed with Taft and Hamilton Holt
on a League of Peace with police
power.

The editors of the Pitt Weekly ap-
parently did not think the war could
continue very much longer. They
said at the close of the Christmas
issue editorial, “The dying of the
bloody twelve—month of 1915 has in
it the seeds of ‘Peace on earth; good
