about hazing

’ JUSTIN MCCLELLAND
Staff Writer

The Greek system is dying, a Victim

of bad press, public misconceptions and '

the stupidity of some of its own mem-
bers, according to Mitch Crane, former
—West Chester, Pa.,, judge and proud Pi
Kappa Alpha member. ' -
, Crane met with an assembly of Pitt
. Greek members last’ night to discuss
changing the attitudes and perceptions
of the Greek system by focusing not on
the partying aspect of Greek life, but on
the values and beliefs on which the
Greek system was originally founded.

“The number of pledges nationwide

, has dropped for six years,” said Crane in
 his speech, noting this.is-the. longest
drought of pledges in Greek history,
even though the number of college stu-

‘ G dents ‘continues to rise.
' “If we.didn’t kill our guests, rape
‘ ' our dates and force our new members to
drink into stupors, I wouldn’t be here
today.” i . ’ ‘
- The solution, according to Crane, is

for each member to become more
responsible and liable for his or her
actions, a choice of action he referred to
as risk management. ‘

“No one is knocking down our

doors to see what happens inside our
houses,” Crane said. “Risk management
is not about eliminating, it’s about man-
aging..lt’s about‘ making sureno harm
comes to our guests and our members.”
, Crane mentioned that a fraternity
house is considered the most dangerous
place on a campus for a freshman
woman. He discussed an incident in
Florida with a freshman who was raped
after ‘attending a fraternity party. Even
though the perpetrator was not a brother
of the chapter that held the party, the fra-
ternity was still sued and found guilty.
The law, explained Crane, states an

organization is responsible for its guests

and friends of any guest -at its party. The
fraternity was liable“ "for serving an
underage student alcohol and not notic-
ing‘ the foreseeable danger of letting her
leave by herself. «

am As‘ anyone who has ever tried to ﬁnd a
iwfjob already knows, it isn’t easy to become
 gainfully employed. The task is even more
 diﬂicult for many welfare recipients,
 j because of troubled histories, uncontrollable
1 1 ’ situations at home or lack of training.
, Because of recent welfare reforms,
these recipientsare required to ﬁnd employ-
ment within a  1

 
  
   
  
 

help them.

.5 The "National Student Partnership is a
service organization dedicated to helping the

pi unemployedﬁnd work ﬂiey can enjoy and

continue doing. - 1 .

‘ Current NSP director, junior Greg

O’Loughlin, has been with the organization

' since the founding of the Pitt chapter in the
fall of 1998. ‘ ’ 1

‘There is a deﬁnite need in Pittsburgh

A group of Pitt  is working to

for an organization like NSP,” O’Loughlin
said. "This organization was created as a
stepping stone for people coming oif wel-
fare. Our target clients are people in need.”
NSP members form a partnership with
three other students who focus on helping
one client ﬁnd a job. One of due students acts

as a primary contact, sitting down with the

client and collecting information about
them. . ’ .
“We ask them about their future goals
and ﬁnd out about [them] and what matters
to them personally. If they don’t have a
resume,.we get them one,” O’Loughlin said.
The other two partners build a database
of jobs that may interest the client. This
means talking to area businesses or even

- looking through the classiﬁed section of the

newspaper and‘ making phone calls, the
director said. .
NSP also helps senior citizens dissatis-

ﬁed with their current employment ﬁnd bet— ,

ter jobs. Oneclient, a 51-year-old woman
with no computer ‘skills, was ‘miserable

 

working for Mellon Bank She had 14 more
years of work before retirement,
The organization contacted~Jubilee

Kitchen, a halfway house that offers com--

puter training. “We enrolled her in a class,
ﬁxed her resume and she had a jo ‘,”
O’Loughlin said.

NSP has helped ﬁve clientsﬁnd jobs

since its inception. Thatnumber may sound ~
‘low, but all NSP members are volunteers,
balancing their time between classes, jobs

and their NSP duties. g _

NSP member Courtney Anderson said,
“I’ve gotten more involved in the communi-
ty since joining. I have a better understand-
ing of poverty and I feel like part of the city.”

“Unlike other organizations, you can
’ get something out .of NSP besides ‘these are

my 50 ﬁiends,’” member Kelly Sabo said.

“‘You know you are doing something and

helping other people.” _ .
“Not to put down other organizations,

.but the difference is you are taking on a real

responsibility,” O’Loughlin added. “But I’m

   

glad I’m doing it You know you are taking
your college career places.” . . '

“And we don’t just make phone calls.
We have fun, too,” Sabo said.

_ NSP was founded by two Yale students
in 1998.

“According to critics, it was just some
college kids with a lot of money having a
good time. They said we were too young
and irresponsible to make much of a differ-
ence,” O’Loughlin, said.

Today, NSP has 21 chapters spanning
from Providence, R.I., to San Diego, Calif.
The organization has received thousands of
dollars in grants from Washington, D.C., to
help continue its work.

Pitt’s chapter is expanding along with

_its national headquarters. NSP Pittsburgh

currently has 31» members.

“There have been times when we
thought we were going to fall apart and
times we thought we were going to mush-

room,” O’,Loughl_in said. “But we believe it -

 deﬁnitely mushroom someday.”

The Pitt News

After being cramped in the back seat
of a car for nearly four hours, the thought

of hauling her clothing, books, a televi-
; sion and a stereo up to her.Holland Hall

dorm room made Autumn Miller sick.
But thanks to this year’s Arrival

Survivalvolunteers, as well as. others in_

charge of housing and residence life, the
move went much more smoothly than
Miller expected.

9 “There seemed to be more parking
this year than in other years,” said ,Miller,

' a junior spending her second year in

Holland. “That sped up the moving

‘1 process a lot. The Arrival Survival people

I saw seemed knowledgeable.”
‘ . » The Arrival Survival program,
designed to assist students and their fam-

‘ ilies moving into dorms, has been coordi-
nated by the Student Government Board ‘

for the last two summers.

Dave Lander, the SGB Arrival
Survival coordinator, said that planning
and recruitment of volunteers began in

February.

“I think this year the program was
slightly better than last year,” Lander said.

_  “There weren’t any major problems last

 year, but the fact that I plarmed so far
 ahead made everything easier. We had
is‘ around 400 volunteers this year and only
 150 last year.” ’

The volunteers, who were easily rec-'

 ognized in bright orange Arrival Survival
$7 T—shirts, were ‘stationed at every residence

 hall and property management building,
as well as in parking lots and in the ID

center. Because so many students volun-
teered, others helped the Pitt police and
the parking and transportation depart-

 ment. Some decorated the campus with

Pitt’s housing services was another

; responding quickly to minor problems in
dorm rooms, such as broken fans or

d lights.

Andrea Castlegrande, a junior who

 just moved into the Bouquet Gardens

tell someone and a repairman came with-

, in a half hour.”

Denine Rocco, the interim director of

’  the housing ofﬁce, agreed that Housing

and Residence Life helped make this
year’s move-in one of the smoothest she
has seen during her nine years at Pitt.

. p Helping incoming, freshmen and

Arrival Survival

transfer students adapt is perhaps where

student volunteers are most helpful.
Even Miller, as an upperclassman,

said that the volunteers and housing

directors helped her a great deal in adjust— \

ing back to dorm life.

“Even though living on campus is a
little more restraining than living in an
apartment or house, it is still more conve-
nient,” Miller said. “Here, there are peo-
ple to help you with everything. I deﬁ-

nitely wouldn’t have got this much help s_

moving ifl were living off—campus.”

 

nothing happens to him or her, no one
will care. Is it too much to make sure

people donfrdrink-too. much, to protect »-

our guests and to sever people who the
frat realizes are damaging [that frater-
nity’s] credibility on campus?”

Crane added that even a fraternity
cleared of charges will incur court fees
and be saddled with a negative label.

Crane has been speaking to frater-
nities and sororities nationwide for
more than a decade, ‘ promoting
changes within the Greek system
before they are forced by college
boards and legislation.

“I understood the main problem
with the Greek system was stupidity,”

  -  ‘ t “ FROM‘ PAGE 1  '0 Crane said after his discussion: “Ivhope

by_ talking with current members we
can‘ re—establish Greek pride.”
Crane alsoargued that many haz-
-..i-ng. - methods.--the Greeks «employ are
outdated and counter-productive to the
values and brotherhood the Greek sys-
tem was founded on.
“How does forcing someone to
drink into oblivion promote brother-
hood? Hurting your pledges doesn’t

promote loyalty, it just makes themi
. hate you.” '

Crane advocated that the Greeks
should refocus on the notions of loyal-
ty, values and friendships.

Amnesty to host
human rights speaker:

BENJAMIN RUBIN

The Pitt News

Pitt’s Amnesty International will
host renowned Burmese human
rights activist and speaker Ka Hsaw
Wa, recipient of several prestigious
international human rights awards,
on Sept. 21. —

' Wa received the’1999 Goldman
Prize for Asia, the Conde Nast
Traveler Environmental Award and
the Reebok Human Rights Award.

As the director and founder of

EarthRights International, Wa has
made many efforts to help create
global awareness. of the social jus-
tice and environmental violations in
Burma.

Aided by Burma’s military gov- ,

ernment, Burmese, American,
French and Thai oil companies
destroyed the Tenasscrim rainforest
in Burma to build the massive
Yadanapipeline to bring off-shore
natural gas to Burma and Thailand.

Burma’s government also forces
peasants to work on the pipeline
without letting them or any other cit-
izens protest its construction. In the
process, the government causes
many villagers to abandon and relo-
cate their homes. ’

Now, Wa is coming to Pittsburgh
to let people know about problems
in Burma and what they can do to
help. A

Wa’s lecture is one of many
events Pitt’s chapter of Amnesty

i

International scheduled for the year.

Last spring, after the inception;
of the student group, co-presidents‘;
Cynthia Kinnan and Lindseyﬁi
Liprando helped organize letter-pi
writing campaigns and petitionsif
regarding human ‘rights violationsé
worldwide. - _ 
They also planned a prote'st'in§
conjunction with local high schooli
chapters of Amnesty International tog
raise awareness about governments}
who force minors into the mil’itary.§
In some nations, some of these chil-E
dren were as young as 6 years old. 

Educating people about human}
rights is one of Amnesty’s predomia;
nant goals. Additionally, Amnesty:
International protests the death;
penalty, works to preserve natural;
resources, free political prisoners:
and support women’s rights. 

Because Amnesty International;
is an advocate for so many different?
causes, the Pitt chapter focuses on{9
topics of interest to Pitt students;
who are active in Amnesty. ‘ 

They also work with journalistst

5'

and writers whose governments have§
silenced them “unjustly” as part of;
Banned Books Week. 3'

The Pitt chapter is part of an

temity for the booze and hooking up,”
said Crane to a round of chuckles, “I’m
here because I remember what being in
a fraternity meant to me and the lifelong
friendships I made from it.”

Change is necessary, said Crane,
because “we believe in the Greek sys-
tem. Wild drinking is fun, but not worth
the consequences of losing the chapter.”

The meeting was organized by the
Inter-Fraternity and’ Pan-Hellenic
Council. 4 » -

Jeff Webber, vice president of pro-
gramming and Sigma Phi Epsilon
member, was impressed by the judge’s
statements.

“Fraternities and‘ sororities are

founded on principles of respect and
making lasting friends,” Webber said
after the assembly. “Movies like
‘Animal House’ — and that’s one of my
favorite movies — are not really reﬂec-
tive of what really matters in a frat.”

Webber hopes Crane’s remarks will
stir a change throughout Pitt’-s Greek
system. A

“I’ve never witnessed any severe
problems in our hazing process,” said
external vice president and Pi ‘Kappa

The difference between proper ini-

tiation and hazing is that hazing serves >

no educational purpose and places the
recipient in physical or mental danger.

“Before requiring something of a 

pledge, ask what’s the purpose of the

action and if it’s dangerous,” Crane
said. “There’s a difference between
knowing the history and values of a

crap,” he said, in reference to a popular

drink a mixture of various vile liquids.
Crane believes that the Greek sys-
tem can still be a vital part of collegiate
social life.
“The solution is to manage risks
and take proper precautions so the fra-
ternity or sorority won’t be harmed.”

Bush’s use of profanity is
ultimately forgivable

A In the last couple of days,
Republican presidential nominee
George W. Bush has come under ﬁre
for telling his vice presidential candi-

date, Dick Cheney, that a New York
Times reporter was a, well, synonym -

for a certain bodily orifice. While
Bush’s comment was unprofessional
and inappropriate considering the
setting — on a podium at a high
school, near microphones — it is not

‘ scandalous and the hoopla over it

should and will quickly subside.

The reporter, Adam Clymer, had
previously written articles that
Bush’s campaign deemed critical of
the presidential hopeful. It is thus
understandable that Bush’s feelings

.. toward Clymer would ‘be less than

affectionate.

But instead of making a veiled, V

semi-public remark to Cheney, Bush
should have confronted the reporter

7 directly and defended his record in

Texas, the area about which Clymer
had reported. After all, Bush often
points to his popularity in Texas (he
was re-elected with 70 percent of the
vote in 1998 and even has the
endorsement of many of the state’s
prominent Democrats) and the posi-
tive aspects of his recordas governor.

Perhaps most importantly, the
timing of this remark was poor, as

Bush faces criticism that he is afraid
to debate and that his campaign
prizes style over substance, while
Democratic candidate Al Gore touts
his campaign as being substance
over style.

Furthermore, Bush missed the
opportunity to make up for hisllapse
in tact when, instead of issuing a
direct apology for the remark, he said
he was only sorry that the rnicro—
phone picked it up. In doinglso, he
continued to sidestep the issue
instead of owning ‘up to hismistake.

However, by no means will this
use of profanity hurt Bush’s shot at
the presidency. Many Americans do
not like reporters and consider ﬂrem
to be too pushy. (Many have proba-
bly even used the same term as Bush
did in reference to some in the jour-
nalistic profession.) In an ironic
twist, he may even gain some sup-
port. Plus, he was being frank and
candid to Cheney, something many
say he has not done in the past with
the public.

There are more substantive
issues on which we should focus in
the two months before the presiden-

. tial election. These issues, and not

mere name-calling, should determine
who leads our country for the next
four years.

WEDNESDAY, SEPIEMBER 6, 2000‘

Oh, to be a Sojourner on the campus of Pitt Johnstown.

This weekend, I ventured home with
two of my roommates, and home to these
gals is Johnstown, Pa. I was pretty excited
about this excursion for a few of ‘reasons.
Namely, because I just like road trips;
because it’s fun to see where your friends
grew up; because having a mom, any ‘mom,
cook for you is never bad; and‘ ﬁnally
because I would be afforded the chance to
check out the University of Pittsburgh,
J ohnstown campus.

Usually I like to think of us as the only
Pitt around, but that is far from the truth.
There are Pitt campuses in Trtusville,
Greensburg, Bradford and J ohnstown, and I
have always been curious about them. Do
the students at ﬂiese colleges feel generally

happy, or do they wish deep down that they

went to Pitt in Pittsburgh? In the same way
that most children secretly think that they are
the parental favorite, does each Pitt campus
feel that it is the ultimate best? Do the other

' Pitt’s have anything that we don’t have?

My roommate Amanda and I trekked
bravely and curiously’ onto the Pitt
Johnstown campus with these questions in
mind. It was about 6 p.m. on Friday evening
when we pulled into .. the parking lot in
Arnanda’s beloved Mustang, which we call
Abe. Already somewhat hip to the ways of
UPJ,Amanda1ed-meinthe direction ofwhat
was fabled to be the hub of campus.

Walking on a sparklingly clean, tree

lined sidewalk, I felt sort of peaceful and sort '

of unnerved. Not a soul was in sight, yet the
campus was very aesthetically pleasing.

Three attractive brick buildings were per-
fectly positioned around a massive ﬂag pole
encircled by a grassy knoll. Lush green
mountains peaked across the
horizon, and the sun was slowl
beginning to set. ~

I was starting to feel
increasingly weird about the
lack of human activity, but
thankfully Amanda and I spotted what had
the appearance of a _student union. As we
approached the building, we breathed a col-
lective sigh of relief as we spotted people —
lots of people in fact, as we could see tables
of kids enjoying tasty fast-food.

We explored the union with all the con-
ﬁdence of typical freshmen. Meandering
rather aimlessly, we came upon on the infor-

The women’s volleyball team
opened its first home stand of the
season in impressive fashion with a
shutout of Duquesne last night at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

The 3-0 win was the Panthers’
third in a row and runs their overall
record to 4-1.

“We were a little nervous,” said
new Pitt head coach Chris Beerman,
including himself in the nervousness
after his first home game. “We were
really trying to impress the fans, and
we settled down and put on good
pressure on defense.”

A total team effort silenced the
Dukes in a little more than an hour,
but the real stars of the night were
Pitt’s strong and tall hitting line up
front, which had a considerable
height advantage on the Duquesne
line.

Throughout the night, the Dukes
could not solve hitters Jennifer
Nickels, Stacy Renick, Marcia
Thiesen and Heather Haff, who all
ended up with at least nine kills and
contributed to a very high .404 hit-

ting percentage.

Haff, a junior transfer from
Kansas State University and a gradu-
ate of nearby North Allegheny High
School, had a stellar homecoming
with 11 kills and a .611 hitting per-
centage..

“We didn’t know much about
[the Duquesne team],” said Renick, a
senior» outside hitter. “We went in
saying ‘play hard’ and expecting
anything.” ‘

Knowing little T about the
Duquesne team didn’t seem to have
much effect on the Panthers as they
cruised to a 13-0 lead in the first
game of the night.

Pitt rattled off five points before
the first sideout and continued to

take advantage of Duquesne’s slow .

start with junior Alexandra Lacenere
supplying an ace and‘Nickels manag-
ing four consecutive kills.

Eventually Duquesne did get on
the scoreboard, but it was too late as
Thiesen provided the final kill, end-
ing the game at 15-4 in favor of Pitt.

“It was too easy in the first
game,” Beerman said.

Cross country season

SHAUN GRIFFIN

Staff Writer

In the company of one of
the best cross country teams in
the Big East, Pitt put on a good
show against West Virginia as
well as Youngstown State at the
Hillbilly Shootout in
Morgantown, W.Va.

“This meet was a great
measuring stick,” said head
cross country coach Waddie
Freeman.

Both the Panther men’s and
women’s teams lost to the
Mountaineers, but both beat the

Penguins in the double dual -

meet scoring system. Each
team was scored separately
against the other two teams to
determine wins and losses.

“It was a step in the right

direction for both the men’s  S

1

women’s programs,” Freeman
said.

Both teams received good
times from seasoned veterans
and freshmen nmning in their
first meet.

“The men were very com-
petitive with the West Virginia
team and I give a lotof credit to
the women for hanging in
there,” Freeman said.

Freeman called . the
Mountaineers one of the top
three teams in the Big East
Conference and also said the
course was very tough.

Despite missing two run-
ners, the women still managed
to put in some good times. They
were led by Amanda Schmidt,
who finished ninth with a time
of 19 minutes, 28 seconds, with
an average mile time of 6:31 on

WEDNESDAY, Srmmszn 6, 

You will see tbe Subway Series in October

It’s September, which means
everyone from Peter Gammons to
your grandma is giving their predic-
tions for the final few weeks of the
baseball season.

The big question of late is whether
Todd Helton will hit .400.

’ My answer, as it has been all sea-
son, is a definite no. Even with
Helton playing a good number of the
Rockies’ remaining games at hitter-
friendly Coors Field, I do

not believe he will
accomplish the feat. The
wear and tear of playing
the last five months will
most likely catch up with .
Helton, and although he
will still finish with an
impressive average, it will not
top .400.

Although it is impossible to
compare baseball today with base-
ball in 1941, the year Ted Williams

 

hit .406, I’m old-fashioned and ’

would like to see Williams’ record
stay in tact. If the record has to be bro-
ken, I would prefer it be done by
someone who has consistently been
one of the top hitters in baseball —
Tony Gwynn. » ,

Williams is one of the greatest hit-
ters the game of baseball has ever
seen; Helton is not, yet.

Another popular question —— can
‘Carlos Delgado win the Triple
Crown?” While the idea is certainly
more feasible than Helton hitting
.400, I do not believe Delgado will be
successful in his quest, either.

Why? Because the players he is
trying to overtake in each category are
just too powerful, plain and simple’.
Batting average would be the most
likely category for Delgado to cap-

ture, with mere percentage points
separating him from

 
 
  
   
   
  
 
 
  
 
  
  
  

and Darin Erstad. But
Garciaparra and Erstad
are both phenomenal
 hitters, and either could

 easily walk away with the
F title as well.

  Nomar Garciaparra

likely continue dri-
ving in runs for the

Karen remainder of the
season, I don’t antic-

 ipate Edgar Martinez
or Frank Thomas slowing their output.
Delgado will have a very tough‘ time
overtaking them in the RBI category,
and will also fail to overtake Thomas
and Troy Glaus in the home run race.
Glaus is quietly‘ having an outstanding
season for the Angels, while Thomas
has returned to “The Big Hurt” that

Yastrzemski will remain the only

‘player since 1967 to capture the

honor

Of course, there is speculation
about which teams will stillbe playing
come October. Without explanation,
simply because it would take too long,
I give my picks for the postseason: V

National League: East — New
York Mets, Central -—A St. Louis
Cardinals, West —-— San Francisco
Giants, Wild Card — Atlanta Braves.

In the American League: East -—
New York Yankees, Central‘ —
Chicago White Sox, West — Oakland
A’s, Wild Card ~— Boston Red Sox.

The Mets and—Yankees will win
their respective divisions and then
clash inia true Subway Series. The
Mets will be victorious in six.

I have always found itidifficultto
determine who the recipient of the
MVP Award should be. Itiis impossi-
ble to compare the players to one
another, as each has a unique situation

. and role in his ball club.»

I feel that the true MVPs this sea-
son ‘are Jim Edmonds in the NL and

‘Frank Thomas in the AL. Both have

led their teams from nowhere to the
top of their divisions, and consequent-

ly the playoffs, while putting up
respectable numbers.

Statistics alone are not enough to
earn MVP honors. Baseball is a team
sport, and personal accomplishments
are meaningless if the team does not
win. I

So‘far this season, no pitcher has

managed to throw a no-hitter. A num- V

ber of players have come close,
including Pedro Martinez and Kris
Benson, who threw one-hitters on the
same day. So will there be a no-no in

2000? I have to say yes, and it won’t

be a pitcher you’d expect, like

\ Martinez. I’m going to go out on a
» limb and say that before the season is
over, Darryl Kile will throw a no-hit- ’

ter. _ “

y This is not a prediction of any sort
but rather a follow-up to comments
that I made in a column in February. I
said that the Reds should not have

traded for Ken Griffey Jr. andthat he '

is a whiny crybaby. Now some people

might not saythat the trade was a bad .

move for Cincinnati, but Junior has
certainly not had the. impact he was
expected to have. Last season, the
Reds won 96' games and just missed

'_ postseason action,~falling to the Mets ‘

in a one-game playoff for the wild-

Bucknell did not go over well with
Sturk.

“The Bucknell game is one we
shouldn’t have lost and I’m really dis-
appointed in that,” Sturk said.

The game was at a stalemate for
the first 75 minutes as the Panthers
and Bison battled fiercely under the
hot temperatures and muggy weather.

But a goal "by Kristie Simon on a
penalty kick took the Panthers out of
their game and led to two more goals
by the Bison in a span of less than

three minutes.

“The penalty kick called against

us took the life out of us,” Sturk said.
“We tried after that, but we didn’t
have the gas to go.”

Climate will once again be a fac-
tor this weekend when the Panthers
ﬂy to Arizona to take on Arizona and
Arizona State. 4

“Arizona is very doable, but
Arizona State is very _good,” Sturk
said. “I’m concerned about adjusting
climatically. With drier air, it is easier
to dehydrate.”

The Panthers’ record fell to 1-3
after this weekend but‘ Sturk is still
optimistic about the rest of the season.
’ “Overall, based on the chemistry

, and attitude we showed during the

game, we’re going to be all right.”

have caused the Panthers to let down

their guard 21 little, and the Dukes’

jumped out in front in the second
with three aces in a row.

“The team did well except for a
little lapse at the beginning of the
second game,” Ren’ick_ said. -

Sophomore setter Carrie Norris
jumpstarted Pitt with a sneaky, unex-

_ pected kill, and the Panthers never

looked back.

“Carrie started out a little tenta-
tive, but ‘got more aggressive,”
Beerman said. i
' Norris spent the night all over
the court, diving for an impressive
nine digs and setting up the hitters

' by tallying 35 of the team’s 40 set-s.

The Panther hitters continued to
dominate with Renick getting the

P _ final 1:111, ending the..game~in a 15-8
f 1' Pitt victory_. _ I A

"In the third game,
finally started to get its offense
going, staying with Pitt for-the first
seven or_ eight points. _

, “Duquesne is a youifg team and
they’ll continue to get better,”
Beerman said. ‘ ' 1

Once again though, the Pitt hit-T

ters proved too much for the Dukes
by adding to their kill totals, ending

.. the night in a 15-9 victory to com-

plete the sweep.
,“We’re at ‘a good level right

~ now,” Renick said. “We always’ want

to be higher.”

The Panthers will get their
chance to move higher when they
face some of the stiffest competition
of the season this weekend at the
Pittsburgh Invitational.

“Arkansas is a perennialTop 301

team,” said Beerman, who also‘

talked , up the other opponents:
Indiana University and Miami
University (Ohio.) *‘ ‘
.“There will be some great
matches and somehigh level volley-

‘ ball.”

the 4,800-meter course.
“It was the best race since she’s
been here,” Freeman said. ’
Schmidt had been hampered by leg
injuries in the past few months, but said
she felt good to get the first meet of the
year past her. _ - P

“I have a lot of work to do still,” said
Schmidt.

She also noted that ‘team chemistry
would be essential to the team’s future
success.

. f‘We need to stick together to run
well as a team,” Schmidt said.

Other _ notable finishes for the
women included Sarah McMillian,
Misha Bilyeu and Beth Rocks, who
came in 11th, 17th and 19th place,

respectively.

The men were led by senior captain
Mike Head, who ﬁnished fourth on the
8,100-meter course with a time of 27:43
and an average mile time of 5:30.

“It was OK for the first meet,” said
Head about his performance. “I fell
asleep a little on the course.” V .-

While satisfied with his perfor-
mance, Head expects faster times and
higher places for himself in the bigger
meets to come. Head’s goals include fm-
ishing in the top 10 in a meet and assert-
ing himself as a contender for a national
championship.

Head also praised freshman Mike
Diano, who was not too far behind, tak-
ing sixth place with a time of 28:01.

. Diano was a little harder on himself,
saying he has a lot of room to improve.’

“It was pretty good, but I expected

better than sixth,” Diano said, “I want to
lower my time "signiﬁcantly and do well
as a team.” -, S

Rounding out the top 20 finishes for
the men were Justin Wiley in eighth,
Lucas Dunlap in 14th, and Jessie
Chalfant in 19th place.

With such young, teams, including,
three of the six runners on the 'men’s side

being freshmen, Freeman saw this past,_

weekend as a good meet to get the',’new—1
corners started. H"

“[The freshmen] got their feet wet a
little bit,” Freeman said.

. The Panthers’ second meet will be
Saturday, when Freeman will be sending
smaller squads to the Duquesne Quad
Meet held in Schenley Park with the
larger, more important Penn State
Spiked Shoe Invitational being held the’
following weekend in State College, Pa.
