WASHINGTON, D.C. — David
Souter was the focal point of
yesterday’s rally in Washington,
D.C., where concerned activists
lobbied against his conﬁrmation
to the Supreme Court. “No
matter whether he is pro-choice
or pro—life, Judge Souter is a
crap—shoot vote on women’s
lives,” said Pittsburgh activist
Jeanne Clark.

Clark, Pennsylvar1ia’s National Organization
for Women representative in Washington D.C.,
joined about 200 people for the rally in the
Capitol. The lobbying effort, sponsored by NOW,
also attacked the Senate Judiciary Committee for
not being thorough enough in its investigation of
Souter. '

“With this selection, Souter could serve up to 30
years on the court,” said NOW President Molly
Yard. “We have to know more about [him].

“We cry for the lives of women who will be
desperate if Souter is approved by the SJC,” she
said.

Yard also criticized the SJC for its handling of ‘

a panel of abortion-rights activists during Souter’s
testimony. When Sen. Joseph Biden (R-Del.)
addressed the panel and said “Good morning,
lovely ladies. I have no questions,” Yard shrugged

her shoulders and rolled her eyes. Yard said that J

her reaction was called “rude” by Sen. Alan
Simpson (R~Wyo.).

“How many times has Sen. Simpson opened a
meeting by saying, ‘Good morning, gentlemen.
You're looking lovely this morning?” She added
that Simpson had, in the past, been a pro-choice
advocate. “He said that he has been pro-choice,”
she said. “But he is not pro-choice [anymore]. He
is pro—life.”

Eleanor Smeal, president of The Feminist
Majority, said, “Souter would be the deciding vote
against Roe lvs. Wadel,” she said.

Smeal encouraged the lobbyists to talk to their
respective senators and urge them to bring Souter
back for more questions. She stressed not allowing
him to evade the right-to-privacy issue.

“Tell them not to take no for an answer,” she
said.

WASHINGTON, D.C. —

College students dominate rally

Many of the

supports women's» rights. “These rights may
be hindered if Souter becomes a justice,” he
said.

Kelly Digby, a senior at Chatham College,
said that she was concerned about Souter’s

participants in yesterday’s rally were young
women and men concerned about a possible
threat to abortion and birth-control rights.
Over half of the group was made up of
college students who had skipped a day of
classes to be in Washington D.C.Joe Mitchell,
a Pitt junior, experienced many hardships to
get to the rally. E S
' “We were supposed to leave at 4:30 [a.m.],”
he said. “But the bus’s headlights broke, and
we didn’t leave until 5:00 [a.m.].” The bus,
which transported about 20 people from the
Pittsburgh area to the rally, did not arrive at the
protest until 10:45 a.m. —— 45 minutes late.

nomination. “He is insensitive to the issues
such as bisexual and gay rights and
discrimination,” she said.» “Souter is not a good
choice.” '

Several schools were represented by large
contingents of students. Smith College
lMassachusettsl brought approximately 40
students to the rally. Students from Warren
Wilson College lAsheville, N.C.l said that they
brought 47 students, 11 percent of the school’s
total enrollment.

Fall brings dmn/zoztz'c change in Oakland business sales

By Rebecca Wilkins
For T be Pitt News

As almost 29,000 students returned to

campus this month, many local
establishments experienced a dramatic
increase in business.

The Original Hot Dog Shop is one of
such businesses. The “O” relies heavily on
students for its business, with almost 75
percent of the restaurant’s clientele
consisting of students, according to
employee Terry Simon. Simon said that
when the fall semester begins, business
may increase as much as 50 percent.
Football weekends, the busiest time for

the “O,” attract an even larger clientele.

In addition to its famous hot dogs and
french fries, the “O” sells a large variety of
beers from around the world, which Simon
said are an obvious student attraction.
Sales of souvenir T-shirts and the opening
of a new barbecue section have also
helped to increase student business this
year, Simon said.

Denise Graham, manager of Gus Miller’s
Newsstand, said that it also depends on
students, who account for approximately
70 percent of its clientele. Graham said
that the store is a lot busier now that
school has started, but that the football
weekends affect business only slightly. A

broad selection national and international
newspapers attract students to the
newsstand, Graham said.

The Pitt Shop, a new store specializing
in clothes with Pitt logos and designs,
counts on university parents as well as
students, according to manager Dennis
Crovella. Panther fans alsosupport the Pitt
Shop. Commenting on the first football
Saturday of 1990, Crovella said that
“business is definitely stronger today."

At the Essex, a card store that sells a
variety of cards, posters and novelty items,
only half of the clientele consists of
students, according to manager Rich
Forsyth. Forsyth said that professionals

from the university and hospital ‘areas
make up the rest of the clientele. Unlike
the previous establishments, business did
not experience a dramatic increase at the
beginning of the semester. Forsyth said
that the football season does not help
business either: “Football Saturdays are
slow days for us,” he said.

At the University Beverage Center only
30 percent of the customers are students,
said employee Jill Barvick. Barvick said
that most of UBC’s clientele are residents
of the Hill District. Barvick agreed with
Rob Bazala, one of the owners, that
business stays about even when students
return to campus.

Souter

Continued from page 1

She said that by putting Souter
on the court would be like “going
backwards another 100 years for
women’s rights.”

“Our first job is to delay the
vote [to confirm Souterl,” Smeal
said. “We don’t know the truth
about him. What is the rush?
Can't they just read the record?”

Smeal blamed the low turnout
on the fact that the rally was held
on a weekday. “This is a working
day. Many women who wanted
to be here have to be at work. But
the senators are here, and it’s
only two days until they vote,”
she said.

After the rally the protestors
marched into the Capitol to be
briefed by NOW representatives

before talking to the senators.

Approximately 20 people from
Pennsylvania then met with an
aide of Sen. Arlen Specter,
showing their support for NOW
and their complaints about Souter.

Chris N iebrzydowski, president
of the NOW chapter in
Pennsylvania, told Specter that
Sou ter’s confirmation was a matter
of life and death for women.
“-Somebody has to be accountable
for our lives,” she said. “I don’t
want women to die like they did
before Roe vs. Wade. Many of
these women don’t remember
that, but I do.”

Niebrzydowski added that
Souter’s testimony was not
thorough enough. “The
questioning that Souter was put

through was wimpy. The
questions were superficial, and
Souter’s testimony was wimpy.
There were too many questions
and not enough answers," she
said. 8

Specter’s aide said that Specter
believed that the questioning was
serious.

Specter’s aide acknowledged
the testimony of the lobbyists but
said little during the meeting.

Specter was also charged by
the group with being too worried
about the upcoming election.
“Sen. Specter is counting
numbers,” Clark said. “We
thought we could count on him.”

Brooks Faure, a freshman from
Lehigh University, agreed.
“Specter is copping out,” she said.

“The elections are coming up,
and he’s counting numbers.”
Niebrzydowski criticized the

SJC for its handling of the hearing.
“The majority of the people have
no idea who David Souter is, ” she
said. “It is no accident that the
testimony was not televised
nationally, nor that the panel of
women, thestrongest opposition,
did not appear until the committee
was ready to leave.”

Faure was disappointed
Specter’s failure to attend the
meeting. “I realize he is a busy
man,” she said. “Butwe are a part
of his constituency. I would have
preferred to speak with him
firsthand. I just hope that the
message gets across.”

being very supportive [by] funding
us.”

Chris Luallen, a student at
Warren Wilson, said he was
disturbed by the low male turnout

at the rally. “I think that women
have more to lose [from the loss
of reproductive rights], but I still
think that more men should have
come. I’m kind of disappointed
that more didn’t,” he said.

“Wholeness starts with ahfaith
in God, which has to be an integral
part of every person’s life,” Sette
said. '

UCO, which promotes “unity
within the body of Christ,” is a
fellowship for Catholics and
Protestants despite their
differences, Sette said.

“What we agree on is much
greater than what we differ on,”
he said.

According to Sette, students try
to “fill a void with academics,
parties, social life, etc.’, when the

‘ultimate [satisfaction] is God.”

“When we commit our lives to
Christ in a daily, ongoing way,
[he] makes up for our
shortcomings, our insufﬁciencies.
[This] in turn provides joy,
contentment, fulﬁllment,” he said..

Carnegie Mellon University
computer-engineering major Eric
Ewenco said he enjoys the group’s
emphasis on personal
relationships with Christian
friends.

“Since joining the group, I’ve

Chabad . House, a Jewish

to learn history and religion and
to experience holidays and

Latchaw, a volunteer at Chabad.

Chabad has been serving the
CMU and PittJewish communities
for years with religious services,
meals and counseling, Latchaw
said.

Chabad is run by Rabbi Shmuel
and Sara Weinstein along with
student volunteers like Latchaw,
from the Weinsteins’ home in

“A philosophy of Judaism is to

“It helps megrow in my faith,”‘
she said. “I find the group setting

The Newman Oratory is named
after the late Cardinal Newman,
whose goal was to encourage
“the intellectual to be more

to be more intellectual,”
according to Summer.

The Rev. Gregory Si-nclair,
adviser for the Chi Alpha Christian
Fellowship, agrees with Summer
that a group setting is important.

“Chi Alpha provides group

Sinclair said.

He said that freshmen have
special problems to deal with.

“One thing about first year that’s

said." ' .

“Sin can be ‘fu-nl,’ but it’s like a
student loan; you enjoy it for a
while, but sooner or later you
have to pay for it,” he said.

At the office of B’nai B’rith
Hillel, students work to educate
the campus about Jewish
concerns. Here, President Allison
Bergman oversees the
organization. Bergman, a
sophomore majoring in religious
studies, believes students should
search for the spiritual part of
their lives.

“We’re not just a religious group.

Steeler defense can hold its head high — again

By Michael Milliron
Sta_ﬂ"lVriter

Scripts of Steeler games are as
predictable as episodes of the
“The A—Team” these days.

CryBubby Brister leads an
offense that fumbles, bumbles
and stumbles. The defense and
special teams are continually
looked upon to come up with
some sort of unconventional
innovation that might enable the
Steelers to win. Captain Kirk once
said, “The best defense is a good
offense.”

If the Steelers want to help
their defense, it is time to start
offending.

Going into Sunday’s game
against the Raiders, the Steelers’
defense had given up a mere 22
points and registered 11 sacks in
two games. However, this would
be the defense’s sternest test of
the season thus far. Offensively,
Los Angeles has gone back to
“Raider football,” which means a
down-your-throat, power-
running game and incredible
speed on the outside to burn
deep. Even without Bo Jackson,
the Raiders possess enough
weapons to be considered a
superpower. Marcus Allen, Greg
Bell, Mervyn Fernandez, Willie
Gault and Tim Brown are enough
to scare any defense.

Though the Steelers did not

b win, the defense again did its job.

They cannot be expected to
provide points for a sluggish

Aaronjones (97) and Donald Evans (66) helped to hold the Raiders to 273 yards, in addition to having a great outing vs. Houston last week.

offense every week. There was
no disgrace in surrendering 20
points to a team like Los Angeles.
The Raiders were held to 273
total net yards, with 66 of those
coming on one play. Other than
Fernandez, no Raider pass catcher
had more than one reception
longer than seven yards.

The special teams set the tone
for a hard—hitting game. After
Gary Anderson’s field goal,

reserve defensive back Garyjones

delivered a bone-crunching hit

on the ensuing kickoff. The
Steelers had trouble stopping
Allen on the Raiders’ first
possession as he gained yardage
up the middle, off tackle and
around end. A 15-yard personal-
foul call against the aggressive
Rod Woodson did not help
matters any. The drive ended
with Jeff Jaeger kicking a 40-yard

field goal, tying the score at three.

A key play occurred in the next
Steeler defensive series. Following
a Brister intefception, Jay
Schroeder dropped back and hit
Fernandez on a hard slant, good

for 12 yards. Davidjohnson was

giving Fernandez a nice cushion,
and the Raiders took advantage
of it. This play was a sign of
things to come later on. This
drive ended quickly, however,

Throwing for ’disc'tance  ,
Pittsburgh F1viI1gDisC SOCi€tY holds frisbee championships

By Spencer Borisoff
For The Pitt News

They were way up in the sky. Not birds.
Not planes. No, not even Supermen.

Discs and Frisbees of all shapes and
sizes filled the skies at Schenley Park last
weekend as the Pennsylvania State Flying
Disc Championships were under way.
Aside from Schenley’s vast open areas for
disc tossing, the park also boasts a complete
-18-hole Frisbee golf course, which has
become immensely popular of late.

The tournament, sponsored by the
Pittsburgh Flying Disc Society, was
comprised of seven different events. The
overall championships, however,
depended on the players’ finishes in only

six events: disc golf, speed golf, maximum »

time aloft, accuracy, freestyle and distance.

Steve Kohman, last year’s speed golf,
freestyle and third—place overall champion,
tossed his way to become the men’s
overall champ by placing second in disc
golf, third in distance and sharing first-
place honors with his teammates in the
freestyle event.

Kohman attributes his success far back
to his childhood. “I’ve enjoyed throwing
things since I was a kid,” he said, “whether
it was pitching a baseball, tossing snowballs
or throwing rocks at trees.”

Jack White and Keith Clark took second

and third place, respectively, in the men’s
overall competition and likewise took
home some of the $1,210 purse which
largely came from player—entry fees.

Sandy Steger won first-place honors in
the women’s overall competition, largely
due to a first-place finish in distance and
disc golf, while Cory Baach and Lynn
Giroux took second and third place,
respectively. ,

Kohman and Steger, the men and
women’s overall victors, were awarded
the Pryor Hendrix Cup, a trophy dedicated
to the person who excelled in all Frisbee
events and was the complete disc athlete.
Hendrix and his wife were tragically killed

1 in a plane crash last year.

According to J. Gary Dropcho, the
tournament director and first-place finisher
in the maximum-time—aloft event, the
Pittsburgh Flying Disc Society has been
active for eight years in an effort to promote
the playing of flying—disc sports and games.
The organization publicizes Frisbee sports
through tournaments, clinics and other
various events. Tournaments are held in a
different city every weekend as well.

Kohman sums it all up. “Frisbee is a
rewarding sport because there is so much
variety. Different events attract all different
types of people. The camaraderie in the
sport of Frisbee is tremendous."

with the Steelers holding on thir
down. '
After a Brister fumble, the
Steeler defense found itself on
the field again. The Raiders went
to a gadget play on first down,
but the Steelers were ready for
Raider trickery. Allen attempted
a halfback option pass to Gault,
running a deep cross pattern.
Much to Allen’s chagrin, Woodson

The ‘Raiders took the second-
half kickoff and came out
throwing. Johnson, even with
deep help, could not contain
Fernandez. He worked
underneath and medium sideline
routes for gains of 17 and 15
yards as the Steelers played him
for the longball. Luckily, this drive
ended when Willie “No Hands”
Gault dropped a pass from
Schroeder on third and 14. The
drive ended with a 45-yard field
goal by Jaeger.

After yet another Brister fumble,
the Raiders had possession again.
Schroeder came back throwing

' but found no one open, as Steeler
pass coverage was superb. Camell
Lake made an excellent play to
bat down a Schroeder pass on
third and 10.

Despite not giving up any long
runs, the Steeler front seven
continued to get pounded by a
mammoth Raider offensive line
that averages about 285 pounds
per man. The Steeler defensive
line averages 270. Starting ends
Keith Willis and Donald Evans
managed only one tackle apiece.
No Steeler defender got to
Schroeder all day.

The Raiders grounded out 125
yards on the day and were able to
get short yardage when they
needed it. Inside linebacker Hardy
Nickerson was the only Steeler to
have more than five. tackles.
Considering how the Raiders were
running, the pass coverage was
solid. Fernandez can beat any

 
  
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
   
  
  
   
 
   
  
 
  
  
 
   
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 

defense if given time to get open.

Unfortunately, A the fourth
quarter marked the beginningof .
the" end for the Steelers. The
Raiders went on _ to score “two
touchdowns, putting the “game
out ‘of,’ reach. Allen ‘seated from“
one yard out, capping-"‘off;‘.a= 13- ’
play," A59-yard drive. Fernandez
again had the. key play, taking. in
a 21-yard pass from Schroeder on
a second and 14 situation, burning
Johnson once again. ,

The Raiders got the ball back
again, and the end result was the
same. Schroeder dropped back
on third and 7. Dwayne Woodruff
had Fernandez short, while Larry
Griffin had him deep. Woodruff
bumped Fernandez inside, with
Griffin taking a step inside,
thinking that he was running
another hard slant. Fernandez
proceeded to take one step in,
then went out as he ran an up
pattern. Griffin was out of
position, enabling Schroeder to
hit him in stride as Fernandez
went in from 66 yards out.

The Raiders played
conservatively on offense. That is
a luxury you can afford when the
opposing team cannotscore. The
Steelers did not force many
turnovers or make many big plays
because the Raiders did not need
to take any chances on offense.
Schroeder only attempted 19
passes. T

The Steeler defense is fine and
will get even better, butyou need
some offense to win in the NFL.
As Steeler Coach ‘Chuck Noll
pointed out, “Physically, we were
in there, but it wears on you  it’s
tough to hang in there when your
offense isn’t productive at all.”

Maybe Noll knows what he is
talking about, however, actions
speak louder than words.
