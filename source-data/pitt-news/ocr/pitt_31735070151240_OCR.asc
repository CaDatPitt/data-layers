Four Pitt football players face May 28 court
appearances after recent run-ins with the
law. ‘ , I

Police issued summons for possession of
drug paraphernalia to junior tight end Drew
Carswell,junior defensive back Eric Williams
and junior defensive tackle Khaynin Mosley-
Smith on April 26 after searching a house
on the 3300 block ofjuliet Street in South
Oakland where the three players were pres-
ent. Police allegedly found heroin and drug
paraphernalia after searching the residence,
according to the criminal complaints. Pre-
liminary hearings are scheduled for all three
players in the Pittsburgh Municipal Court.

Freshman quarterback Tra’Von Chapman
also faces criminal charges after ofﬁcers from
the Kent ‘Police Department in Kent, Ohio,
arrested and charged him with one count of
assault and one count of unlawful restraint,

according to court documents. _

According to court documents, Chapman
has been released on his own recognizance
after his father, former Kent State assistant
coach~Thad]emison, posted Chapman’s bail.
He’ll appear in court for preliminary hear-
ings at the Kent branch of the Portage County
Municipal Court.

The Kent Police Department declined to
comment on the case.

None of the four players responded to
emails requesting comment.

Pitt head football coach Paul Chryst an-
nounced on April 30 the dismissal of Carswell
and Williams from the team. Mosley-Smith
and Chapman remain on indeﬁnite suspen-
sion, according to a statement from the Pitt
Athletic Department.

The Pitt Athletic Department could not be
reached for comment on why Mosley-Smith
received only a suspension despite receiving
the same charges as Carswell and Williams.

Former Western Psych employee seeks
 damages from Pitt, UPMC in lawsuit

Gideon Bradshaw
News Editor

A former employee of Western Psychia_tric Institute and
Clinic who was injured in last year’s shooting and her
husband are now seeking damages from Pitt.

An attorney for Kathryn and John Leight presented an
amended complaint April 29 before an Allegheny County
court. According to the amended complaint, which is
more than 80 pages long, the couple is suing Pitt. They
also included UPMC and its affiliates the Re:Solve Crisis
Network, University of Pittsburgh Physicians and Susan
Shick, the mother of the man who carried out the shoot-

ing. In theioriginal complaint, the Leights sought damages:

only from the estate of the shooter. ,
On March 8, 2012, John Shick, who had previously been

evaluated at Western Psych and whom physicians had iden— -

tified as schizophrenic, entered Western Psych with two
semi-automatic handguns and opened fire. He shot one
person fatally and wounded six others, including Kathryn
Leight, before Pitt police officers fatally shot him.

Leight suffered two gunshot wounds in her chest and
abdomen, which pierced one of her lungs and damaged
other internal organs. These injuries have required mul-
tiple surgeries.

. “She greatly appreciates that her life was saved due to
the prompt medical care,” said attorney Mark Homyak,
who is representing Leight and her husband.

But the shooting has left its marks.

In addition to Leight’s physical injuries, she has also
suffered from post—traumatic stress disorder since the
incident. S. ,

Unlike the first complaint, which Homyak filed lastjune,

the amended complaint draws exten-
sively on events from Shick’s medi-
cal records. Homyak said he obtained
the records after serving a request to
the attorney for Shick’s estate, David
Rosenberg.

Rosenberg did not respond to a re-
quest for comment.

The Leights are seeking damages
from Pitt, alleging that the University
failed to ensure that UPMC implement-
ed suitable security measures at West-
ern Psych. Even though Pitt, which
owns Western Psych, had delegated
management of the clinic to UPMC,
the University was still legally respon-
sible for providing adequate security.
The complaint argues that Pitt could
have reasonably expected patients’
behavior to pose a danger to Leight and
taken additional measures, including
security guards and a clear, protective
barrier at the receptionist’s desk.

Pitt spokeswoman Cara Masset said ‘
that the University does not comment
on pending legal cases.

The complaint alleges that UPMC
maintained inadequate security at
Western Psych, although it could ex-
pect “that the conduct of some of the
Western Psych patients‘ entering the
lobby posed an unreasonablerisk of

should have taken steps to have Shick
involuntarily committed but did not.

University spokesman to retire this month after 14 years

Em Maier
Assistant News Editor

After 14 years on the job, Pitt Vice Chancellor of Com-
munications Robert Hill will retire May 31.

According to a press release from Pitt’s Office of Pub-
lic Affairs, Hill supervised all communications related
to the University, including national media, marketing,
University publications and its online presence.

Under Hill’s tenure, the Office of Public Affairs ex-
panded, earning national and international recogni-
tion for its publications. In 2000, he founded the Pitt
Chronicle, the University’s first official weekly publi-
cation. He also published numerous other University

materials, including the annual “Report of Chancellor
Mark A. Nordenberg,” the “Economic Impact Report,”

the “Community Impact Report” and “Blue, Gold, and
Black.”

Hill’s accomplishments include creating the most
successful fundraising campaign, which grew from $500
million to more than $2 billion duringqhis time. Hill,
whoicoined the University motto, “Truth and Virtue”
also worked with Nordenberg to promote and support
the Booster Booster program, which helped with the
second immunization of measles, mumps and rubella
for Pittsburgh [Public School students. '

Nordenberg and Hill also partnered in other projects.
They established an annual Black History Month Pro-
gram and hosted the premieres of two documentaries,
including “K. Leroy Irvis: The Lion of Pennsylvania and
“Gold 8: Black: From Doorway to Distinction.” “Vice
Chancellor Hill has brought a unique set of talents to
hisjwork, and together we have shared many satisfying

victories,” Nordenberg said.

Before arriving at Pitt, Hill worked for a numberof
years as Vice President for University Advancement
at California University of Pennsylvania. But much of
the early portion of his career was spent at Syracuse
University, where he served as Vice President for Public
Relations from 1988 to 1998. 9 i ‘ '

Hill is leaving with a bounty of awards from the Uni-
versity and the larger Pittsburgh community. These
include awards from the .International ASSQCiat‘10n‘Of,’

schizophrenia when he was 23. Au-
thorities in both New York City and
Portland, Ore., had Shick involuntarily
committed on five separate occasions.

One ofthese commitments began in
April of 2008 after Shick flooded his
New York City apartment. When fire-
fighters arrived, he threatened them
with a knife. Police then forcefully
restrained him, and a court ordered
psychiatric treatment for him.

In addition to getting involuntarily
committed in New York City, Shick was
also committed in Portland, Ore., after
he tried to attack an airport security
guard with a flashlight.

In the portions ofthe amended com-
plaint that detail Shick’s behavior, a
pattern emerges. While Shick was un-
dergoing treatment, he remained sta-

ble. When Shick felt stable, he would‘

stop taking psychiatric medication,
resulting in delusional and aggressive
behavior. T
He entered graduate programs
at Portland State University and
Diiquesne University, but left both

programs after less thanya semes-'

ter. At Duquesne, at least five women
complained that Shick harassed them,
according to the amended complaint.

‘Shick, as part of his illness, fre-
quently sought care from physicians

     

May 8, 2018 I The Pitt News I vwvvv.pitinevvs.c0m

for legitimate or perceived ailments
while denying that he suffered from
schizophrenia. Instead, he often
claimed that his symptoms stemmed
from physical causes. Consequently,
he saw a range of different specialists
for a broad spectrum of complaints,
ranging from a potassium deficiency
to erectile dysfunction.

Between his move to Pittsburgh in
June 2011 and the shooting at West-
ern Psych, Shick saw more than 15
different doctors affiliated with the
University of Pittsburgh Physicians
and UPMC, including psychiatrists at
Western Psych and mobile teams from
Re:Solve visited Shick’s apartment
twice in February. Several doctors,
including those who eventually told
him they would no longer treat him,
expressed concerns about his mental
health to one another.

Also in a February‘ 2012 letter,

Shick warned one of the doctors he _
was seeing at UPMC Family Medicine .

in Shadyside to be careful that month,
according to the complaint.

He also sent emails, characterized
in the complaint as “grandiose, con-

fusedand disjointed,” which identified, 

UPMC doctors by name and criticized
the care they provided in numerous
medical departments aswell as other
physicians in the U.S. and one in India.

Later that month, at UCLA gas-

-troenterologist who received one of

these: ‘messages emailed a UPMC doc-

tor whom Shick identified, express-
ing concern that Shick was probably
a paranoid schizophrenic. He also cop-
ied Shick’s email into his own.

“I wondered ifyou remembered this
gentleman, or have any insight about
what he is trying to do, or whether
he poses a real threat to you, me, or
anyone else he is contacting,” the doc-
tor wrote in his email, which the com-
plaint provides in full.

The UPMC physician who received
the UCLA doctor’s email thanked the
doctor and forwarded it to his col-
leagues. During this exchange, the
UCLA doctor noted that Shick also
sent him a written letter in which he
criticized UPMC and its personnel and
accused them of denying him treat-
ment. The UPMC doctor said he would
contact the “risk management/legal
department.”

Although the amended complaint
is uncertain abouttwhgther the doctor
c—onta’c':ted’ that department, it notes
that UPMC “failed to investigate and/
or take any action in regard to Shick.”

The team from Re:Solve visited
Shick’s apartment for the first time
after a.UPMC-doctorisaid he was afraid
that Shick’s psychotic behavior posed
a threat. A team went to Shick’s apart-
ment again after his mother asked a
Re:Solve employee to encourage Shick
to agree to hospitalization.

According to the amended com-
plaint, the doctors and other profes-

8

sionals who saw Shick during this time
could have had Shick involuntarily
committed but ultimately did not.

The Leights are also seeking dam-
ages from Susan Shick, the mother
ofjohn Shick, who was sailing in the
Bahamas at the time of the shooting.

In the amended complaint, the
Leights allege that she failed to in-
form employees from Re:Solve and
University of Pittsburgh Physicians of
her son’s history of violence when he
refused to take his medication, even
though she was aware of previous oc-
casions when authorities had him in-
voluntarily committed.

The complaint alleges that Susan
Shick knew that close family support
could help control her son’s symptoms.

“Nevertheless, Susan, attempted to
take control of her son’s life from a
distance, while she continued to live
extremely geographically far from
him,” the complaint says.

It also notes that several UPMC phy-
sicians attempted to contact Rezsolve
about filling out the paperwork to have
Shick committed, but Re:Solve did not
follow up with them to ensure that they
completed the paperwork.

In a March 2012 post on The Log of
Moira, a sailing blog that Susan and
her husband, Larry, maintain, Susan
Shick said that her son had been ver-

bally abusive and alienated, although
“never physically threatening.”

Last June, in an update to the post
from March, Susan Shick added that
in order to have her son committed
in Pennsylvania, she and her husband
would have had to provide evidence
that he posed a physical danger to
himself or others.

“We were not able to provide any
evidence to meet the standard that
Pennsylvania demands,” she wrote.

Susan Shick did not respond to a
request for comment made through
her sailing blog.

Homyak, who is representing the
Leights in the case, said that he has
not specified the amount of damages
he will seek for the Leights because
state law prevents him from doing so.

Court records show that UPMC,
Re:Solve and University of Pittsburgh
Physicians have responded to the suit,
entering an appearance and naming
John Conti andjeffrey Wetzel as their
attorneys. Pitt has not yet responded.

. Homyak said that, as of Tuesday, a

process server working on behalf of
his firm has been unable to locate Su-
san Shick, whose last known location
was in the Bahamas, in order to serve
her with the amended complaint. I

  Prostitutio .   poses valid claims:" 
Sex work is legitimate work

Christy Lampe
For The Pitt News

Prostitution is typically considered a crime worth
ﬁghting: It objectiﬁes women and can damage the
psyche of those who participate in it.

But prohibition of prostitution in the United
States simply won’t stop this. Prostitution is a
victimless crime because much of the danger-
ous activity doesn’t come from engaging in the
activity itself, but from the activity being illegal.
To the extent that there are victims from prosti-
tution, the government’s prohibition is more to
blame than’ the act of itself because sex work is
legitimatework. . -

The problems in the 'industry3farise;from the

vulnerability ofthe workers engaged in prostitu-
tion. Currently, women seek protection from be-
ing “ripped off” or abusedin thecact by working
under an employer, or pimp. But thésepimps often
exploit their female‘ employees b‘oth1ﬁjnancial1y
and physically. , 7 ~ 4 r

 

By legalizing prostitution, women would have .

little need for a man’s protection,and>it would
severely diminish the role»ofpim‘1§s.,> ‘

 

would curb the number of rape—related crimes. A
study from Northeastern State University estimat-
ed that if prostitution were legalized in the United
States, the rape rate would decrease by roughly 25
percent, or approximately 25,000 rapes per year.

~ Furthermore, prostitution is little more than
an argument of women’s rights. Yet in order to

make this argument, I must ﬁrst make a clear‘

distinction that I am referring to prostitution and
not sex trafficking. Prostitution differs from sex
slavery or human trafficking in that it involves no

unwillingparticipants or individuals coerced into

the act of sex. -
There is also a greatdeal ofghypocrisy when it
comes to the laws of prostitution. Consider this
situation: A man pays a woman $500 to have sex
with him..This would be deemed illegal in the
United States. But now suppose he still pays her
$500 to have sex with him, __but sets upa camera,
ﬁlms the act and then posts the videoon the In-
ternet. This is entirely legal —‘ in fact, he is an

entrepreneur in the $3.9 billion pornography industry.

Or, consider another example from the modern dating
scene: Suppose a man isn’t looking for a girlfriend, a friend
or any sort of company for that matter. He simply wants
someone to have sex with without forming a connection
or attachment. What does he do? The man will likely meet
an attractive, but perhaps vulnerable woman and convince
her he is interested, lie to her and take her out to dinner
a couple of times. But once he ﬁnally gets her into bed, he
never calls her again. This leaves the woman feeling used
and hurt. In effect, the woman has been exploited, as she
decided to have sex for a man who left her with the false
promise of a relationship. At least a prostitute is fully aware
of what she is getting herself into.

Or, bring to mind the popularized idea of having a “sugar

 

daddy.” If a woman has sex with a man because he buys her
designer jewelry, expensive purses or even pays her rent,
she is not breaking any laws. Yet the moment the woman
accepts money, she is. There is no consistency within our
laws today.

For some women, prostitution might be the preferable
way of earning a living, and what gives government the right
to tell them what they can or cannot do with their bodies?
To deny women this opportunity is not fair.

Additionally, from an economic standpoint, prostitu-
tion is a largely unexplored, multimillion—dollar industry
that could add to federal tax revenue. The average annual
income of an employee at one of Nevada’s legal brothels —~
working only one week per month —— is at least $100,000,
according to an article published in The Times of London.
Under current tax laws, this would generate nearly $20,000
in annual federal income tax for each legally licensed sex
worker. This would be in addition to fees the government
could impose for obtaining a proper license.

Sure, there would need to be regulation for this industry.
Age requirements would be necessary and, like the cigarette
industry, the government could prohibit advertising or so-
licitation in order to protect those that might be offended,
while simultaneously allowing customers to ﬁnd what they
are looking for on the phone or Internet.

Legalized brothels could provide health care for their
prostitutes as well as a clean and safe work environment.
These women would no longer need to walk the streets to
ﬁnd their clients. Smartphone apps could be made available
with ratings for each brothel to encourage competition and
safe practices.

Legalizing prostitution is not the same as endorsing it,
and I am not endorsing the act of selling sex. But I believe
it would create a lucrative business. After all, it is one of the
longest—standing businesses in the world. R

IMPULSE

Former Pitt News cartoonist ﬁnds Internet success

Jeff Ihaza
Stqff Writer

Ardent Pitt News readers might remember a
comic featuring the misadventures of a boy
named Douglas and his friend Business Cat a
few years back. That comic, titled “Our New
Electrical Morals,” is now the latest cartoon
on the online channel Cartoon Hangover.

The cartoon’s creator, Mike Rosenthal,
graduated from Pitt last year and currently
studies television production as a graduate
student at Boston University.

Rosenthal started submitting comics to
The Pitt News in 2008, beginning with a
short titled “King Jember,” a comic about
a king who just can’t seem to get the whole
“ruling over people” thing right. Rosenthal
then moved on to new material with more
advanced graphics in his comic “Mr. Map’s
Ice Cream Show,” the slightly morbid story
of an ice cream shop owner who is continu-
ously harangued by young customers.

“No wonder your wife left you,” one of
the characters says to Mr. Map after learning
of his grape ice cream.

Shortly after “Mr. Map’s Ice Cream”
stopped running, Rosenthal began sub-
mitting the “Our New Electrical Mor-
als” cartoon. The cartoon consisted of a
back—and-forth between Douglas and his
proﬁt-minded friend, Business Cat, as they

engaged in a reduction ad absurdam of dif-
ferent topics. ‘

Another Pitt alum and former Pitt News
contributor Noah Levinson played a crucial
role in getting the oﬁbeat comics to print.

“The layout editor at the time would
come up to me and say, ‘I don’t get these
comics, but I think you would,’ and I would
email back and forth with Mike making
small edits,” Levinson said in an email.

The two shared a pen-pal—style rela-
tionship for some time before a professor,
identifying the pair’s similar writing styles,
arranged for them to meet. From there they
collaborated on a number of screenplays
and short ﬁlms. .

“We sort of hit it off and just knew we had
to work on stuff together,” Levinson said.

Levinson,lwho now works as a writer in
New York City, says Rosenthal has always
been a work horse, diligently updating his
portfolio with new endeavors.

This diligence is what caught the atten-
tion of Cartoon Hangover, a part of Fred-
erator Studios. Though Frederator is best
known for shows such as “Adventure Time”
and “The Fairly OddParents,” the studio has
produced 16 different television series since
its founding in 1998. Rosenthal says he sub—
mitted a cold spec, or unsolicited script idea,
for them during his last few months at Pitt.

“I emailed them out of the blue, and they
responded saying they didn’t take specs but

would accept a longer script,” Rosenthal said

He then returned with his undergraduate
research project from the previous sum-
mer, a 30-minute short ﬁlm script, but the
company rejected him again -— this time
his work was too long.

Finally, Rosenthal made a ﬁve—minute
short based on the characters he thought up
for The Pitt News and, as he puts it, “They
went for it.”

After all of their communication, the
producers at Cartoon Hangover were sur-
prised to ﬁnd that Rosenthal was still an
undergraduate.

“The ﬁrst thing they asked was what my
schedule looked like. I told them I was get-
ting ready to take my ﬁnals, and they didn’t
really know what to say,” Rosenthal said.

Rosenthal now works with a team of
creators, making his ideas come to life.
“Our New Electrical Morals” layout de-
signer Kenny Pittenger divides his time
between Rosenthal’s cartoon and designing
the backgrounds for the latest SpongeBob
Squarepants ﬁlm set to be released next year.

“Working with Mike has been a real
pleasure. He knows exactly what he wants
and doesn’t want, thank goodness, so, even
though it took the better part of a year from
start to ﬁnish, the process of making this
short went pretty smoothly” Pittenger said
in an email.

, The show is another in a growing trend

of cartoons appropriate for adults. The days
when cartoon—watching was relegated to
kids eating brimming bowls of cereal on
Saturday mornings are over. Shows such
as “Adventure Time,” “Archer” and the
programming on Cartoon Network’s “Adult
Swim” have re—established the idea that
adult humor can ﬁt into an animated format.

’ “Well, when animation began, it was
geared toward an adult audience,” said Pit-
tenger. “Somehow, along the way, it became
associated with children’s entertainment.”

“I think the resurgence of animation for
adult audiences is a positive thing, and the
Internet is a perfect vehicle for that. Ani-
mation is just another method of storytell-
ing, and I think it’s very limiting to look at
it as something that is only for kids,” he
continued.

Rosenthal has always been passion-
ate about cartoons, and he sees no reason
for them to be reserved for children. His
favorite cartoon right now is “Adventure
Time,” which he describes as “just great.”
Rosenthal says the character of Lumpy Space
Princess is one he’d like to see developed.

“There’s just so much they could do with
LSP, and I hope they do it,” Rosenthal said.

The ﬁrst episode of “Our Electrical Mor-
als” is online now and already has nearly
200,000 views, so Rosenthal can continue
to develop his own characters of Douglas
and Business Cat in the future. I

Fitz and The Tantrums lack soul on sophomore album

John Lavanga
Impulse Editor

More than. Just a Dream
Fitz and The Tantrums

Grade: C+

A few years ago, Los Angeles’ Fitz and The
Tantrums exploded onto the scene with an
album comprised of an intoxicating blend
of modern pop sensibility and Motown-
inﬂuenced soul titled Pickin’ Up the Pieces.
The band originally came into existence
when Michael “Fitz” Fitzpatrick bought an
electronic organ and teamed up with old
friend and saxophonist James King, who
recruited talented and charismatic vocalist
Noelle Scaggs. Their ﬁrst album, combined
with their stunning live performances, cata-
pulted the band into the national spotlight

On their new album, Fitz and company went synthy. photo courtesty of Fitz and the Tantrums

“cool kids” were listening to.

What was perhaps most impressive about
this debut was the way that Fitz and The
Tantrums managed to breathe new life and
energy into a track list that would have ﬁt

band’s dapper outﬁts are reminiscent of
The Temptations, there’s a modern ﬂair to
the cuts and the color schemes. The back-
and-forth between vocalists Fitzpatrick and
Scaggs certainly felt rooted in the past as
they belted out stories of heartbreak, af-

delivered the lines with earnestness and
emotion, which made it feel as though Fitz
and company had lived through their songs.
Grooving bass lines anchor the musical
stylings while King’s energetic and colorful
saxophone work emotionally punctuates
them. The band also draws on a number of
musical genres for maximum effect. King
himself noted that his opening riff on the
track “Dear Mr. President” was inspired
by British electrorock legends Depeche
Mode. In short, the album is neo soul at
its ﬁnest, and after three years of wowing
crowds across the country, the band has
established itself among the elite outﬁts of
the burgeoning genre.
When placed in this context, it would
be difficult for any album to live up to the
high expectations of the music world, but
the band’s sophomore release, More Than
Just a Dream, is more than just a mild dis-
appointment to anyone with an affinity for
saxophone and soul. Within the album’s 12
tracks, Fitz and The Tantrums make a depar-
ture from the neo soul genre entirely, opting
instead for a lusterless, synth—he“avyg pop

Hip-hop’s throwback kid

Patrick McAteer
Editor in Chief

By the time 18-year-old Brooklyn native
Joey Bada$$ was born, hip-hop’s golden
era had reached its twilight years. Classic
albums such as The Low End Theory by A
Tribe Called Quest and 3 Feet High and Ris-
ing by De La Soul challenged preconceived
notions of what hip—hop was and forever
raised the standards by which listeners
deﬁned great hip-hop. —

It was an era deﬁned by musical inno-
vation, a refusal to bend to the whims of
record companies, and styles deﬁned by
the neighborhoods in which the artists were
raised, particularly in New York City.

Today much of this attention to detail
has fallen by the wayside. Hip-hop and
rap have undoubtedly grown immensely
in terms of popularity, but much of this

' is the result of a rise in shoddy song writ-

ing, with meaningless lyrics and simplistic
beats. It’s hard to place the works of Waka
Flocka Flame in the same category as Nas’
legendary albumqlllmatic.

, Enterjoey Bada$$.

Bornjo-Vaughn Virginie Scott, Bada$$,
a ﬁrst-generation U.S. citizen whose par-
ents hailfromjamaica, ﬁrst began writing
poetry and rapping at age 11. Early in his
high school career, he and a few of his class-
mates formed the Progressive Era Crew, all
of whose members appear regularly on each
other’s respective tracks.

Since releasing his ﬁrst mixtape 1999
last summer, Bada$$ has drawn ‘rave re-
views from critics and his online fanbase
alike. But what’s most impressive about
the high school senior is his appreciation of
hip-hop’s history, which pours out of every
track on his debut project.

Take, for instance, “Survival Tactics,”
a track that implicitly pays tribute to the
hardcore rap group N.W.A. with_ its blunt
lyrics, including one of the most power-
ful openings to a song in recent memory:
“N *ggas don’t want war / I’m a martian with
an army of Spartans / Sparring with a knife
in a missile ﬁght.” He combines combative
lyricism with aﬂow similar to that of Black

Thank you to The

_4l2-687-7777 (Hex up 8 couannol
2-421-934 I 1

Thought, frontman of The Roots, exhibiting
a dynamism that’s well beyond his years.

The most endearing quality of his collec-
tive work thus far is its variety. If “Survival
Tactics” is a 10 on the scale of intensity,
“Waves,” another single off 1999, is a one.
The song features a more introspective
Bada$$, with lyrics such as “since nine
ﬁve, momma been working nine ﬁve / And
I know the landlord fed up with our lies /
So we pray to the gods, the Jahs and the
Allahs / To keep us safe and watch over our
lives.” It’s lyricism that’s poetic, but also
very conscious — a N as-like quality that’s
largely absent from modern hip—hop.

Bada$$ combines this deep lyricism on
“Waves” with a light, airy backing track that
sounds as if it were produced by A Tribe
Called Quest’s Ali Shaheed Muhammad.
You can almost picture yourself walking
down a New York City street at dusk as the
song proceeds.

The level of maturity demonstrated
in both songs resulted in 1999 receiving
a number of accolades, including being
named the Top Mixtape of 2012 by HipHop-
DX.com and the 38th best album of the year
by Complex Magazine. This critical acclaim
has led to recent collaborations with Pitts-
burgh rapper Mac Miller on his mixtape
Macadellicas well as a spot on A$AP Rocky’s
debut album, Long. Live. A$AP. X

The bar has been set high for the young
artist. With his debut album, B4.Da.A$$,
scheduled for release injune, Bada$$ is sure
to gain a wider audience in the near ﬁiture.
Of course, having the title of New York City’s
next big-time hip-hop artist brings with it
an enormous amount of pressure, but if his
sentiments in “Survival Tactics” are any
indication, Bada$$ is ready for the chal-

lenge —— or any challenge, for that matter. I

Panthers earn  
tournament berth

Nate Barnes
Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt baseball continued its winning ways in the Big East
this past weekend, sweeping a series for the ﬁfth time this
season in conference play on the road against George-
town. The wins propelled Pitt into a tie for ﬁrst place in
the Big East standings as the Panthers approach the Big
East Tournament. _ W

The Georgetown series also marked the ﬁfth time that

the Panthers swept a Big East opponent in 2013, improving .

on a school record after breaking the previous record of
three with a victory over Cincinnati at home April 27-28.

The Panthers currently ride a 12—game winning streak
after South Florida won over the ﬁrst weekend of April and
are now tied with the Bulls for ﬁrst place in the Big East.
Additionally, the three wins sealed a Big East Tournament
berth for the Panthers.

Pitt (36-11, 15-3 Big East) outscored the Hoyas (25-21,
5-13 Big East) by 27-8 over the series and saw the starting

The weekend also saw Wotherspoon and outﬁelder
Stephen Vranka named to the Big East Honor Roll. As a
whole, Pitt maintained its No. 17 ranking in the Collegiate
Baseball Newspaper poll and earned its ﬁrst ranking since
2010 at No. 24 in the recent Baseball America poll, making

_ for its second ranking in program history.

Mildren, who is 9-2 on the season, earned his confer-
ence-high ninth win Friday with another stellar perfor-
mance as the staff ace, pitching eight innings while allowing
three runs on eight hits and striking out six Hoyas.

“I felt good, ran into a little trouble in the seventh in-

Mildren’s effort on the mound held Georgetown’s offense
in check long enough for the Panthers to establish a 5-0
lead after six innings before the Hoyas touched Mildren
for three runs in the seventh inning.

At the plate, designated hitter Boo Vazquez, hitting a
team-high .353 after the weekend, powered the Pitt offense
as he went 5-for-6 with two doubles and four runs batted
in. Vazquez staked the Panthers to an early lead when he
brought lead-off hitter Stephen Vranka home from second
base with his single to center ﬁeld.

Vranka doubled to begin the game, one of his two on
the day. Vranka ﬁnished 3-for-4 with two walks and scored
three runs out of his lead-off spot.

After Georgetown came within two runs in the bottom

 

of the seventh, Pitt responded immediately in the top of the
eighth to increase its lead from 5-3 to 7-3. Third baseman
and team captain Sam Parente delivered a one-out single
through the right side, which scored Vazquez and Steven
Shelinsky from second and third bases.

Vazquez gave the Panthers another insurance run in

The Big East Track & Field Tournament went
as planned for a number of Pitt participants
this past weekend, as multiple Panthers took
home conference titles.

Following a 200-meter dash win, junior
Carvin Nkanata anchored the men’s 4x400

r~;-rrelay team to a conference title. Nkanata

was later named the Most Outstanding
Performer at the Big East Track and Field
Championship in Piscataway, N._]., following
his successful relay performance while also
setting a new career best time of 20.83 in the

,.,_,200-meter dash.

The four-man relay team of junior Micah
Murray, junior Brycen Spratling, freshman
Olivier Philogene and Nkanata ﬁnished clear
of the rest of the 11-team ﬁeld in the 4x400,

winning the race by more than two seconds.
Spratling later set a new school record in
the 400—meter dash, sprinting to an overall
second-place ﬁnish in 45.94 seconds.
On the women’s side, senior Elizabeth

Kline’s heptathlon victory solidiﬁed her_

status as the best all-around women’s ath-
lete in the Big East. Kline’s victories in the
100—meter hurdles (13.90 seconds), long
jump (5.79 meters) and the 800-meter run
(2.13 minutes) catapulted her to the title in
the two-day, seven-stage event. In the fall,
Kline also took home gold in the pentathlon
in the Big East Indoor Championship Meet.

A new conference for Pitt brings addition-
al postseason opportunity, as the Atlantic
Coast Conference announced its 2013 bowl
schedule, which includes eight guaranteed
bowl slots and one additional conditional
contract. The ACC champion will play in
the Discover Orange Bowl, the conference’s
official Bowl Championship Series tie-in, if
the ACC champ does not reach the Vizio BCS
National Championship Game.

The Orange Bowl matches the ACC cham-
pion with one team receiving an at-large bid.
The game takes placejan. 3, 2014, at Sun Life
Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla. ESPN owns
the television rights to the game.

If two ACC teams are not selected for the
BCS, the Chick-ﬁl-A Bowl will host the next

selection of ACC teams, which will play an
opponent from the Southeastern Confer-
ence in Atlanta, Ga., on New Year’s Eve.
Following the Chick-ﬁl-A Bowl, the Rus-
sell Athletic Bowl owns the next choice,
which matches the third-place ACC team
against an opponent from the newly re-
named American Athletic Conference —
formerly the Big East -— in Orlando, Fla.,
on Dec. 28. .
The 80th annual Hyundai Sun Bowl owns
the third selection of ACC teams after the
BCS and takes place New Year’s Eve after-
noon at Sun Bowl Stadium in El Paso,‘ Texas.
The fourth selection of an ACC team he-

Success is certainly not something new for Pitt’s right-handed

pitcher Matt Wotherspoon.

The Mountain Top, Pa., junior, who idolized Roger Clemens
‘growing up, posted a 1.59 ERA over his ﬁnal two seasons at Crest-
twood High School. ’ .» A ' 9

Wotherspoon led Crestwood to the 2009 Wyoming Valley

Conference andlLeague Championships. He was a two~time se-
lection for the Wyoming Valley Conference All-Star team and a
three-time member of the Pocono region Keystone team in the
Keystone State Games.

1 It was during one of the Pocono regional games that Pitt as-
sociate head coach Danny Lopaze ﬁrst saw the tall righty live for
the ﬁrst time. After another visit from Lopaze and a tour of Pitt,

; .-~-Wotherspoon decided to continue his pitching career at Pitt..; V
' “Coach Lopaze saw me at a-high school tournament andvliked  Z A

what he saw,” said Wotherspoon. “Next, he went to one of my

 high school games and expressed interest. I visited, and I really

liked the school, all of the coaches and all of the guys on the team.
' After-that, I committed, and it’s the best decision I’ve ever made.”
While Wotherspoon struggled a bit his freshman--year; there
was one performance on a cold March day during a critical Big
East series against Connecticut'— a team that ﬁnished 45-20 and
made noise in the NCAA tournament — that took manager Joe
Jordano and the coaching staff by surprise. 
“One of the glimpses I had of what Matt could do occurred
during his freshman-year. Our ball club was struggling, coming
off of back-to -back losses against UConn, a team that was in the

  Wotherspoon’s maturity key for Panthers

top ten or so. We really needed a win badly, and Matt took the
mound that day and tossed seven shutout innings, picking up a
big win for our ball club. That start for our staff proved that he
has the stuff to be pretty special,”Jordano recalled.

The righty held the potent UConn lineup to just three hits while
striking out seven Huskies that day. In the process, Wotherspoon
picked up the ﬁrst conference win for the Panthers and his ﬁrst Big
East win, improving his overall record to 2-0 on the young season.

Following the UConn game, the freshman season rolled on
successfully for the 6—foot—1 right-hander. He ended up winning
three more decisions, catapulting him to an overall record of 5-2
with a modest earned run average of just 3.78. In 15 appearances,
the freshman struck out 31 batters in 50 innings of work.

Wotherspoon was poised for a huge sophomore campaign

after starting off the 2012 season with a 13—strikeout performance
against Michigan State, a squad that was predicted to win the Big
Ten last season. i K ,
He only allowed one run over the full nine innings against
Michigan State. Thewin improved his record to 2-0, marking the
second-straight season he started with two consecutive victories.
The performance garnered Big East Honor Roll mention for the
ﬁrst time in Wotherspoon’s career.

 But after the strongiperformance against Michigan State,
Wo'therspoon’s season did not go. as originally planned. The very
next start, Wotherspoon earned a no-decision against Hartford
after he allowed six runs in just ﬁve innings of work.

BOWL CAM ES

and features another matchup between teams"
from the ACC and the AAC on Dec. 28.

The Franklin American Mortgage Music
City Bowl in Nashville, Tenn., at Vanderbilt
Stadium will see the ﬁfth-selected ACC team
square off against another SEC team.

Choosing sixth is the AdvoCare V100 Bowl,
which also occurs on New Year’s Eve. This
bowl matches the third contest between ACC
and SEC teams at Independence Stadium in
Shreveport, La.

The ﬁnal selection from the ACC will play
in the Military Bowl presented by Northrop
Grumman in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 27 at
Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium.

The conditional bowl contract includes a
potential bowl game for an ACC team in the.
Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl if either the Pac-12 or
Brigham Young University are unable to fulﬁll
their commitment to the bowl game, and the
ACC has an available, bowl—eligible team. The
game will take place at AT&T Stadium in San
Francisco, Calif., on Dec. 27.

The only bowl game mentioned above in
which Pitt has participated is the Sun Bowl.
Pitt lost 3-0 to Oregon State in 2008 and
defeated Texas A&M 31-28 in 1989. I

second inning, a total that proved enough
(to defeat Georgetown since Pitt pitchers
allowed only three runs later in the contest.

Wotherspoon, who is 7-1 this season, ﬁn-
ished his day after scattering one run and ﬁve
hits over seven innings of work and striking
out six batters. _

In the second inning, shortstop Dylan
Wolsonovich delivered his second home run
of the season in the second inning, a three-
run blast to left—center ﬁeld. The redshirt
freshman ﬁnished 4-for-5 with three RBIs
and three runs scored.

Pitt tacked on another run in the third,
two in the ﬁfth and another one in the sixth,
giving the Panthers a 8-0 lead before the
Hoyas could get on the board.

Pitt 6, Georgetown 2

Aldenhoven, 7-0, maintained his perfect
record Sunday as he pitched the Panthers to

baclean sweep of Georgetown, working seven
innings and allowing two runs, one of which
was unearned. Aldenhoven’s performance
also lowered his earned run average to a
team-best 2.13.

Offensively, Vranka carried his hot hitting
through the end of the weekend with his
seventh home run of the season in a 2-for-5
day at the dish. Vranka’s hitting continues
to improve his numbers after starting the
season hitting in the low .200s. His average
is now up to .304 alongside his seven home
runs and team-high 17 doubles.

“Just taking a new approach, just kind of
being more hyper at the fastball,” Vranka
said about his improvement over the season.
“I’ve just been seeing the ball a little better
and being a little more patient too.”

But for the ﬁrst time all weekend, the
Panthers faced a deﬁcit in the second in-
ning after the Hoyas’ ﬁrst baseman _Steve
Anderson scored on a throwing error by Sam
Parente at third, putting Georgetown up 1-0.

Aldenhoven prevented the lead from
growing any larger, and Pitt scored two in
the fourth to take the lead on a two-RBI
double by Parente, who atoned for his mis-
cue in the ﬁeld.

Pitt tacked on runs in the ensuing in-
nings. In the ﬁfth, Shelinsky singled to cen-
ter to bring catcher Elvin Soto home after
his lead- off double. Vranka then hit his home
run in the sixth, and Evan Oswald drove
Shelinsky in from second with a single in
the seventh, pushing the Panther lead to 6-1.

The weekend domination kept Pitt on
its torrid pace, one that will likely land the
Panthers in the College World Series for the
ﬁrst time inJordano’s tenure. But the future
doesn’t concernjordano, as the team still has
two weeks of baseball left to play.

“This is what we call our postseason run.
It’s like a new, new beginning today,”]ordano
said. “It starts the next ﬁve games at home
and will obviously continue to the Louisville
series and then into the playoffs. We’re going
to continue to focus on very simple things
that we’ve been doing all year, but having a
renewed energy and a renewed focus.” I

WOTHERSPOON

Wotherspoon followed the Hartford start
with a loss in his next game and earned no-
decisions in his two starts after that.

Coming into this season, Wotherspoon
knew that control was going to be para-
mount if he wanted to improve his poor
ﬁnish to the sophomore campaign, in which
he ﬁnished 4-4 with a 5.03 ERA.

“The main difference this year is my
walks,” said Wotherspoon. “My freshman
and sophomore years, I struggled with my
control, but this year I’ve been attacking
the zone and throwing strikes.”

As a result of the improved control,
Wotherspoon has already earned seven
victories this season —— the second most
on the team — and has been named to the
Big East Honor Roll twice.

Wotherspoon has already struck out 65
batters in his 87.1 innings of work, ranking
him ﬁrst on the team in strikeouts, second
in innings pitched and second in complete
games. .

“This year he continues to pitch well for
us,” said Jordano. “Each time he toes the
rubber he seems to get better.”

Wotherspoon has lost just one game this
season, and catcher Elvin Soto thinks he
knows why.

“The biggest thing about Matt right now
is his maturity,” Soto said. “He’s maturing
and changing after every single start. He’s
becoming more of a pitcher now rather than
a thrower. The stuff was always there, now
he’s got a swagger on the mound thatmakes
him extremely fun to watch and catch.”

The only loss of the season for Wother-

spoon was a rain-shortened, seven-inning
affair against Wofford in March that Pitt
ultimately dropped 3-2. Since that game,
pitching coachjerry Oakes seems to think
that Wotherspoon has really improved the
mental aspect of his game and, as a result,
he is starting to see more success.

“His mental side of the game is get-
ting better every week,” said Oakes. “Two
months ago, Matt would struggle to get
through tough situations in the game. We
work on it together every week, and he is
getting better every week on learning how

to pitch. Two months ago he struggled to
learn how to pitch at times, and he would
just throw.”

As a result of these changes to his game,
Wotherspoon and the Panthers are enjoy-
ing success. The team already has 36 wins
overall and 15 conference wins, which has
the Panthers tied atop the Big East with the
University of South Florida.

Despite the success, Wotherspoon and
the Panthers are not looking ahead to what
might come next, instead, the team is wor-
rying about the remaining games on the
schedule before the Big East Tournament.

“We don’t focus on anything that has
already happened. We only worry about get-
ting better and improving every day,” said
Jordano, who is in his 15th year at the helm.

Despite not looking ahead, these Pan-
thers certainly threaten to do some damage
inthe second season. Wotherspoon, junior
Ethan Mildren and junior Rhys Aldenhoven
— the top three starters for the Panthers ——
are a combined 23-3 on the season. All three
pitchers have earned run averages below
three, and all three starters have thrown
at least 70 innings while holding opposing
batters to a batting average below .250.

As a result, the team has set high goals ,

for the remainder of the season.

“We’re playing to win the Big East Cham-
pionship. We want to win it the very last year
that we’re playing in it. After that, we want
to make it to a regional,” Wotherspoon said
when asked about the team’s goals.

The team opens a ﬁve-game home stand
against Ohio, Villanova and Kent State be-
fore the team travels to top-ranked Louis-
ville in the ﬁnal series of the season. But
Wotherspoon and his teammates are not
looking ahead to the MLB Draft or any-
thing that does not involve the success of
the team.

“A couple of agents and advisers have
reached out to me, but Major League Base-
ball is not really something I’m thinking
about,” said Wotherspoon. “Right now,
I’m just focusing on the rest of the season,
and the goals we’ve set.” While there is still
plenty of baseball to be played, Wother-
spoon and the Panthers might have a shot
at making some noise in the next month. I
