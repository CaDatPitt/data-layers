Gradua'teSchool of Business gets grant

By Dean Bartholomew_

For The Pitt News \

Westinghouse Electric Corpo-
ration and the University of Pitts-
burgh recently announced a joint
project to develop a computer-
ized management system. The
system will schedule the
resources of Westinghouse’s
Energy Systems Service Division.

The six-month project will in-
volve the development of a
scheduling system which will op-
timize the assignment of highly-
skilled personnel to field assign-
ments around the world. Equip-
ment and material resources will
be assigned to these field projects
in a follow-up program.

The project is being funded by
a $10,000 grant from Westing-
house and will cover the ,de-
velopment costs and administra-
tive expenses involved in the
project.

The project is being directed by
asociate professors Pandu
Tadikamalla and Gajanan Hegde.
The main work of the project,
however, will be done by 11 stu-
dents from Pitt's Graduate School
of Business. They will be de-
veloping the scheduling system.

”We are just the directors,”

«Tadikamalla said. ’’It will be the"

students themselves who will in-
teract with Westinghouse officials
to complete the project.” _

The 11 graduate students
designing the project have been
divided
modeling group, headed by Eric
Kok, and a data processing group,
headed by Phil Heal.

”The modeling group will be
using linear programming to de-
velop an optimal. scheduling sys-
tem,” said Kok.

”The dataprocessing group
will sift through all the informa-
tion we collect and take what we
need out.of it,” Heal said. ”Then

' we'll try to develop some type of

model with the linear pro-
gramming.”

Because both groups are
presently working independent-
ly of each other, a liaison be-
tween the groups is needed. Amy
Kandra will serve as project coor-
dinator, bridging the gap be-
tween the groups.

’’Basically my job will be to in- _

teract with the modeling group
and the data.-processing group to
keep everyone well informed,”
said Kandra.

The Westinghouse project is

projects are not designed for
everyone. _ '

”The criteria for choosing the
students [were] based_not only on

their G.P.A. but on their specific
skills as well,” said Tadikamalla.

Hégde added, ”We tried to get

McFarlane overdose

By Rita Beamish ‘P

Associated Press “Writer

WASHINGTON — Police have
that ‘Robert C.
McFarlane, the former presiden-
tial adviser whose mission to
Tehran was at the heart of U.S.
arms shipments to Iran, tried to
take his life with an overdose of
Valium, a police source said.
McFarlane, 49, remained
hospitalized at the Bethesda
Naval Medical Center in good
condition, said hospital spokes-
man Lt. Russ Sanford.
McFarlane was taken to the
hospital near his home in subur-

ruled suicide attempt

ban Maryland after he swallowed

. 25 to 30 Valium pills, said Detec- '

tive Lauren Acquaviva of the
Montgomery County Police
Department.

Police would not discuss the
case, but a source close to the in-
vestigationfwho spoke on condi-
tion of anonymity, said detectives
had concluded that the overdose
was a suicide attempt.

”l’m not commenting,” said

Montgomery County police"

spokesman Harry. Geehreng. ’’I
don't think it's any of your

who dealt with Van 'Mastrigt’s

high school principal at South-
Park High in an attempt to admit '

Van Mastrigt to CMU under the
early_ admission program.
”He was; very agreeable and

very nice.-There's no reason {or v

”He was always really nice. I '

He was a very open person. He —

didn't have a lot of friends, but
the ones he had were close,” said’
Boyce.

Floyd Nevling, county homo-

Former CIA director calls Reagan ’Out of touch’

EDINBORO, Pa. (AP) ~ Form-
er CIA Director Stansfield Turner
said it's ”inconceivable” that
President Reagan didn't know his
National Security Council’ aides
were supplying money to the
Nicaraguan Contras.

”Mr. Reagan is out of touch, I
believe. He's so accustomed to
his magnificent touch with the
country and the Congress that he
is unable to accommodate in his
mind that he has really lost
touch,” he said.

Turner, who headed the CIA
under President Jimmy Carter,
also called on Reagan to fire
some top aides, including Chief
of Staff Donald Regan and Secre-
tary of State George Schultz, to
begin restoring credibility to his
troubled administration.

”lt’s inconceivable to me that
Reagan didn't know Col. (Oliver)
North and Admiral (John M.)
Poindexter were getting money
to the Contras through a lot of
devices. It's inconceivable that he
didn't know some of those ways
at least bordered on illegality,”
Turner said Monday.

The 63-year-old former Navy
admiral made the remarks at a
lecture and press conference at
Edinboro University, about 90
miles north of Pittsburgh.

Turner speculated that Rea-
gan’s ”frustration level went right
off the scale” over Americans
held hostage by militant Moslem
groups and led him to get ”car-
ried away into ideas that were
naive and of questionable le-

gality.”
Airline says it will pay

a record violation fine
WASHINGTON Eastern
Airlines has agreed to pay a
record $9.5 million fine for safe-
ty violations found in a 1985
government inspection after fight-
ing the enforcement action for
nearly a year, Transportation
Department officials said
Tuesday. .
The fine was sought by the Fed-
eral Aviation Administration in
early 1986 and when. Eastern re-
fused to pay, the FAA turned the
matter over to the Justice Depart-
ment for possible legal action.

NEWS BRIEFS

ASSOCIATED PRESS

Under the agreement, Eastern
will pay $1 million immediately
and $8.5 million by the end of
1989.

The Transportation Department
said in a statement that Eastern
has agreed to pay the full $9.5
million, by far the largest civil
penalty ever assessed against a
commercial airline for safety vio-
lations.

Youths in custody for

racial attack of black

NEW YORK — Police yester-
day took into custody 12 youths
indicted in connection with a ra-
cial attack that left a black man
dead, and news reports said some
of them have been charged with
murder.

”I understand they're all in,"
said Lt. Thomas Fahey, a police
spokesman, as the youths
charged in the Dec. 20 attack
were being processed. ”Upstairs

they're working on a list of names
and charges.”

The attack took place on Dec.
20, when three black men whose
car had broken down in the most-
ly white Howard Beach section
of Queens were chased from a
pizza parlor by white youths
brandishing a bat and a tree limb.
One of the men died when he
fled onto a highway and was hit
by a car.

Reports of Khomeini’s

ill health questioned

NICOSIA, Cyprus, — Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini spoke in pub-
lic Tuesday for the first time in
almost 12 weeks and said his
people demanded ”war/until vic-
tory” against Iraq.

The address by the 86-year-old
Iranian leader at a mosque near
his home in north Tehran came
on the eve of the eighth anniver-
sary of the revolution that toppled
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.

Although some Western media
have reported Khomeini’s health
was declining, he spoke in a
strong and steady voice during

Pitt's decision to black out Monday night's basketball game?
between Pitt and Syracuse within a 35-mile radius of the city
was unfair, inconsiderate and embarassing to the university.
~ The decision, obviously, was a business decision. Associate
Director of Athletics W. Dean Billick said the university had
to keep in mind those fans who had already purchased tickets.
The game did not sell out quickly enough, thus, a blackout was
declared. What Billick failed to mention was that many Pitt fans
did not realize the game was blacked out until Sunday and Mon-
day —— after the game had sold out.

The game would have sold out anyway — even if it were
not blacked out. _ - l

. Perhaps the athletic department was paranoid from the huge‘
mistake it made two years ago. with-the football program.

- LPitt:had entered an agreement with Television Enterprise Net’-' 

work during the 1985 season — Foge Fazio’s last as head coach
— to have the school ’s football games televised locally. What
the athletic department did not realize was that some of those
games would be home games.‘Consequently, several Pitt home
football games were televised locally that season and attendance
dwindled.

Having a successful, major college basketball program is more
than just wins and losses. Public perception of the program,
from its team manager to its power forward to its athletic direc-
tor, is vitally important. The Pitt-Syracuse game on Monday night
left some good memories in the minds of those who had tick-
ets and saw the game, but it left a bad taste in the mouths of
students and area fans who could not see the game until 1 p.m.
yesterday afternoon when ESPN replayed the broadcast.

Shame to the athletic department for denying everyone else
the opportunity to see such an historic game in this school's
basketball program. '

I didn't wantto, butl did 

I have never attended ‘a Pitt
basketball game. "I have never
really been a fan of basketball on
any level. I have nothing against
the sport; it just never held any
real interest for. me."

Working at The Pitt News, it is
inevitable that I should become
at least exposed to the sport. Half
of the people who work here are

.- .$h.eItelred in the. news, {depart-
ment, however, I'd managed to
remain-detatched. Or at least I
thought I had.

It crept up on me slowly,‘

without. any warning. It began
with the simple act of tossing a
crumpled piece of paper into the
wastebasket. From‘ out of no-
where, a hand would block the
shot. A pass to the assistant edi-
tor -— then back to the desk edi-
tor who would slam it into
another wastebasket.

I should have suspected that
the syndrome was growing more
severe when a Nurf basketball
hoop appeared over the bulletin
board. Like an epidemic, it
spread, throughout the news-

would all haveended there if it
hadn't been accompanied, by

[another phenomenon: Pitt was

on_a roll.
My friends would watch the

’ games on TV while I read. Un- I

beknownst to them, I would
secretly look up from my book
every now and then and actually
become interested in the game.

And then one day I cheered.

It was just a small cheer. It was
provoked by a shot by Rod
Brookin. They tell me it was a lay-
up. They tell me it was the Georg-
etown game. I don't remember
very clearly. I do remember very
distinctly that it was Rod Brookin,

and it -was a beautiful shot. ~

The extent of this syndrome’s
effect hit me on Monday night,
when I found myself huddled
with three other people around a
radio, listening to the Syracuse
game. I didn't miss a word. And
this time, I really cheered  often
and loudly.

dWhat it a_I_l comes down to. is

es_and failures of the 15 men on
Pitt's-basketball team incite pride
or ‘disgust in the rest of us? The
vast majority of the students have
absolutely nothing to do with
Pitt's position in the Big East con-
ference, but how many of you
found yourselves today saying
”We’re in first place"? And of
those of you who did, how many
of you would be attending games
if Pitt were in last place?

It's probably a dilemma as old
as organized athletics itself.

All I know is, now that I finally
do want to go to a basketball"
game, I probably couldn't get a
ticket if my life depended on it.

Reagan should be remembered for forgetting us

Reagan's America

All right, who is this lack Burk-
man fellow? And why is his arti-
cle ”Reagan — more than talk”
in The Pitt News? I don't think
that this guy is a student because
he totally ignored Reagan's poli-
cy toward education. Sure, the
president is more than talk. Do
you remember when he attempt-
ed to abolish the department of
education early in his first term?

If you have ever read the Week-
Iy World News, then you would
be familar with Ed Anger’s
column ”My America.” Give it a
look and decide for yourself if Ed
deserves the space in the News
more.

Mr. Buck concludes in his arti-
cle that "the president's imagery
has played a signifigant role in in-
fluencing American people to
think positively, to think of the fu-
ture." What about the present?
Mr. Burkman asks several ques-
tions in his article, and one is:

”Why are more college students
looking to the future with hope?"
Why are they? So that they can
graduate, get a good job and start
paying back their student loans?
Or because President Reagan will
be out of the White House?

Basketball blackout I

[...j As I learned from an article
in The Pittsburgh Press, the [Pitt-
Syracuse] game [would] be
‘blacked out for a 35 mile radius
of Pittsburgh. We can thank the
Pitt athletic department for this.

Dean Billick, assistant athletic
director at Pitt, said that the game
was moved to the Civic Arena so
more fans could see the game.
But by blacking out the game, in
actuality, less fans would be able
to watch Pitt in its most important
game in years. I was one of the

LETTERS

many unlucky ones unable to ob-
tain a student ticket. So I called
the Civic Arena on Sunday, and
a recorded message informed me
that the only seats still available
were located at nose-bleed alti-
tudes. Thanks, but no thanks. Mr.
Billick also states in the article
that the blackout will stand be-
cause ”we have an obligation to
the paying customers, too.” Ar-
en't I a paying customer, Mr. Bil-
lick? I pay several thousand
dollars a year to attend this
school, doesn't that count? Does
the Pitt basketball team belong to
Pitt anymore? The athletic depart-
ment is always crying for greater
student support for the school's
sports teams. So finally, when stu-
dent interest is at a peak, the ath-
letic department turns around
and stabs everybody in the back.
C'mon fellows, do you want stu-

’ dent support or don't you? By the

Pitt athletic department opting to
have the game blacked out, it
reinforces the notion that college
sports are around for only one
reason, money. [...]

Imperfect America_j.I__

_\As I observe the daily news,
Dan Rather (CBS), I inadvertent-
Iy witness what appears to be rad-
ical behavior. Now, being an
American, I think to myself, ”Oh,
those Iranians, they're crazy!" But
the interesting part of the matter
is that the joke is on me! My in-
ference is the same ignorance in
which all of us possess. The KKK
(Ku Klux Klan to those of you
who are in the same boat as me)
is parading the streets of some

small town in the South. The I

town is irrelevant. The ideology,

however, of these lunatics is not.

- Now, we all know what a deli-ti} Q

Cate subject this is but, obvious-
ly, one must not mistake freedom
for the voice of deliberate hatred.
This group is confused and, evi-
dently, they belong in, well, I
would say another country. But
why endanger the spirit [of] less
critical nations? -

We all have our scapegoats, A,
and it is just a shame it has to be "

people whom we affiliate with

every day. The ”funny” part

about it is that one would think
that as a person becomes more
educated, these silly tendencies
of bigotry would vanish. I am sor-
ry to say that this is not the case,
and take it from a white Jew, peo-
ple just don't seem to learn from

past mistakes. This is rather un-.,.,
fortunate for those of us who are‘?

Dreams, inspiration, intuition,
these phenomenon are the relics
of our primal, evolutionary past,
and they guided our survival for
millenia. Religious symbolism,
like other forms of entertainment,
gives comfort to the conscience
and makes the soul quite snug.
The belief and the faith of reve-
lation are highly prized aspects of
religiouslcharacter. There will be
some aspects of this which would

_ seem unreasonable, primarily the

violent aspects. When dreams
turn violent, they should be con-
fined to the realm of entertain-
ment and excluded from political
power.

What is to be discouraged is re-
ligious fundamentalism and vio-
lent art ——‘ not that which is
entertainment, which is good fun,
but its pursuit of political power.
This rejection stems foremost
from the dictatorial approach to
religion and politics, which
characterize the Bully Pulpit of
Christian Fundamentalism, the
hypnotic Svengalis of punk rock
para-military cults, as well as
some of the rock-world politicos.
Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry is so
violent, that I suspect he should
have been kept out of office. Pat
Robertson's leaps of faith, requir-
ing a suspension of belief, display
a general arrogance in their
detatchment -from the practical,
the workable, and indeed, the hu-
mane, but it is in the visible pur-
suit of political power that it is
most in need of criticism.

The primitive and dreamlike
nature of religion and political
idealism seems particularly
salient in a generation navigating

world. It is not only drug testing
that should be considered before
granting admission to the Feder-
al Government but also entertain-
ment history. Has the prospective
office holder ever used violence
in film? If entertainment is a
reflection of dreams and dreams
translate into reality, then con-
siderable evaluation of dreams

. should precede appraisal for pub-

JAMES cnAnv

lic office. It is on the issue of the
bomb that the revelation theories
of the Fundamental Primitives or
the doomsday promises of Sofex
seem most intent on subduing the
hard-earned rationalism of civili-
zation to sleeping-sickness. On

the issue of the bomb, the howls .

of doom-sayers are especially
animalistic, primitive, dreamy
and absurd — perfectly OK in en-
tertainment but not public office.

The bomb, to the Fundamen-
talist, is either proof of God or
proof of Satan. Its great power
provokes images of Armageddon,
the Inferno and the spectral
shadows of the nightmarish
abyss. If the bomb has any pur-
pose, therefore, it is to put man
back on track with the laws of
God, to demonstrate, irrevokably,
that power belongs only to love
and that love will guide us into
whatever particular dream seems
most expedient on a given day.

Whether the sourcebook is the ,

’ Koran, the Bible, or the Beatles’

 the stormy watersof the nuclear ‘

White Album, no doubt there's
an excuse for knifing somebody
if you look at it tvvistedly.
David Bowie’s experience of
fame and- the mental strain in-
volved, and his use of the nuclear
bomb invideo promotion raises
the spectre of idolatry from. the
books of Vishnu..In Vedic mysti-
cism, the god Shiva comes to
dance the cities into ruin. Shiva
is the spirit of destruction before
rebirth, the sledgehammer of sex
and warfare. For example, in
David Bowie’s pirouettes across"
the dance floor, a trick of the light

presents the iconography of a di- '

abolical priest. The effect is the
same when you are listening to

‘Kiss. The music's tribal insis-

tence, rhythm and heat can, if
you cross your eyes, seem to take
on the voice of the fire and brim-
stone preacher, whose anger and
bombast are fearfully pitched- to

Fickle fornication

Q. It all began to go to pieces
when we joined a health, raquet
and tennis club this past summer.
My girl and I had been going
together three years, and we

I planned to get married in the

near future. At first she hated
everybody on my tennis team, es-
pecially X. Then while I was play-
inggtennis, I noticed that she
would be talking to X, and the
next day they were playing
together and, after that, she liked
everybody on the team. So we
broke up, and she was going with

g X and still is dating me.

We do things together, we
sleep and have sex together, but
we're not as close or comfortable
as before. I know she stays over-
night at his place, but she says
they don't have sex. She says we
might get married after she finish-
es -college and asks me to take
her shopping, to restaurants, to
drive her to school. She'll track

me down wherever I am — at .

work, the club or home. Some-
times I ,wish she would not do
this. The biggest problem is that
I love her .so much.

A. We will not worry about
whether she and .X have sex
when she stays overnight with
him —OK? It is not a question of

someone who loves her deeply.
I can see that you are hard to
give up as a chauffeur, and no
doubt you buy her a nicer lunch
than she would have on her own.
There you are, patiently waiting

‘whenever she needs you, even _

for sex when she isn't discussing
Peruvian stamp issues with X.
You are a‘ great kind of guy; I
could have used one like you at
several points in my life.

You love her, and that is beau-
tiful — but going nowhere. If you
wait for her on the present plan,
by the time she gets her degree
you will have used up three sets '
of tires driving her wherever she
goes, and she will say, ”I’|l al- A
ways love you;_ there will always
be a special place in my heart for
you,” and the next thing she has
a big job and has hooked up with
someone named Y, and they both
have cars, so you can find a new
passenger to take places.

drive out the demons ofcommon
sense and sanity.

Naturally, it is not my position
that such fearsome art should
bring down upon the rock world
the wrath of a crusade, nor the
PMRC, congressional committee
on censorship. I mightfeel that
way if the bands were illegally
broadcasting nuclear launch
codes. There may even be some
creedence to the dream of Shiva,
and I welcome the free associa-
tion of Satan and nuclear war, on
the part of adolescent poets in
Christian theology. Such dreams
serve to question the arrogance of

"planners whose whole federal

economic scheme for survival re-
lies on weapons which have no
future, but which activate the
male hormone and the lust for
power.

The conclusion to which my
unorthodox speculations have
taken me is that dreams have a
transformative capacity —— and

v the capacity to delude. I strongly

blame the deluded for misleading
the young. Among the deluded,
I include Fundamentalist Christi-
ans, who have made us apathet-
ic toward Armageddon ' by
marketing it as an inevitability.
Such folly is beyond punishment.
I also hold‘ the entertainment
mediums which advocate vio-
lence, not as cathartic, but as a
sport, responsible for the power
of suggestion that they are har-
nessing. By holding them respon-
sible, I do not seek to judge.
Those who advocate violent sport
for entertainment are different
from the violent themselves. For
this reason, violent speech should
only be considered wrong when
the speech is demonstrably in-
tended for political purposes.
This may appear like an overly

’hard—line approach to freedom of

speech. So be it. I think the alter-
native would find us with mani--
acs in office. Whatwe listen to
and say and what "we do are
different. I do not condone or ad-
vocate violence. “Hence, kill
everything. I ‘

fa rce I

a new passenger now? Because
you need her and she certainly
can use a guy like you. Look for
someone who has a special place
for you in all the rest of her life.

Once you have a new pas-
senger, you just won't be availa-
ble for driving this college girl
around. Even nice guys some-
times have to say, "Gee, I'd love
to, but I'm all booked up.” This
immature girl you have been in-
volved with will, I suspect, real-
ly be outraged that you have
something else to do, and she
will demand ‘to know what you
are doing. Just say, ”Maybe
another time.”

I have said that your girl, or X's

‘girl, whichever, is using you. But

you are using her e for sex. She
may feel that she is giving you
something for all your patience
andtime and wear-and-tear. But

.you are deeply dissatisfied, _and

sooner or. later (I say make it
sooner),.you will begin looking
for someone who gives love for
love, pleasure for pleasure, help
for help, and not to save carfare.

But don't try to replace X's girl
-- like an appliance. Instead,
move around in new social cir-
cles, and make friends with wom-

. en first. Stable friendships do

ripen into stable relationships.

real jukebox hero

Ever since I was a kid I
have been crazy about juke
boxes. At times I think my
life has amounted to noth-
ing .more meaningful than
seeking out the best juke
box in the United States. I
am constitutionally unable
to walk into a bar or restaur-
ant without putting money
into the juke box. A

  

When I was growing up,
there were three major
brands of juke boxes. There _
was Wurlitzer, of course. There was Seeburg. But the brand of
juke box I loved best was the one with the greatest name of
all: Rock-Ola. —

Even as a juke boxaficionado, I couldn't tell you the stylistic
or structural differences between the major brands. I adored
Rock-Ola juke boxes’ simply because they were called Rock-
Ola. I naturally assumed that they were named in honor of rock
’n’ roll; Rock-Ola, obviously, was a combination of the terms
”rock ’n’ roll” and ”Victrola._”

All through my life I have lived with that assumption. All
through my life I have regarded Rock-Ola as the coolest and
cleverest product name of them all.

And then last week I found out the shocking truth.

There was a guy named Rock-Ola. The fact that he manufac-
tured juke boxes was purely a coincidence. Rock ’n’ roll had
nothing to do with it. '

He is still alive. His name is David C. Rockola, he just

celebrated his 90th birthday, and he is chairman of the Rock-
Ola Manufacturing Corp., which used to be located in Chica-
go and is now located in suburban Addison, III.

This is a person I had to talk to.

”A lot of people thought Rock-Ola was named after rock ’n’
roll," Rockola told me. ”The fact is, when I started the busi-
ness in—-1926, we were the Rockola Scale Co. But everyone mis-
pronounced the name. So I put thehyphen in it so that people
would say the name correctly. I think it was in the year 1930
that the Rockola Scale Co. became the Rock-Ola Manufactur-
ing Corp.” - .

The company still produces juke boxes, as well as coin-
operated vending machines. ”There are Rock-Ola juke boxes
in every state in the United States, as well as 52 foreign coun-
tries,” Rockola said. ”Sweden, Spain — they all know the name
Rock-Ola. In Brazil, machines that play records aren't even
called juke boxes. They're called Rock-Olas. It's generic.”

Even though his name has become almost synonymous with
rock ’n’ roll, Rockola was never a big follower of rock ’n’ roll
music. After all, he was 60 years old when it first became
popular. _ _. . . _

”I wasn't really a fan, but I was quite familar with it,” he said.
”Natural|y, with all the records in all the juke boxes, I could
hardly not be aware of it.”

At 90, Rockola is still active. He is up at 5 am. every day,
and most.days he goes to the Rock-Ola plant. He is aware that
although he does not have a famous face, he has a famous name,
and he does the best to maintain his privacy.

”Half the timewhen I go to a restaurant, I'll make the reser-

. vation in the name of ‘Simpson’ or ‘Rogers,’ ” he said. ’’I’d rather

not have them know who I am and ask a lot of questions about
juke boxes.” —

Fortunately for Rockola, he has always enjoyed listening to
music. ”It would be too bad if I didn’t,” he said. ”I like any
kind of ‘music. No particular favorites.”

4 ”I’m not much ofa dancer, but I do like to sit an listen‘. One
thing about rock ’n’ roll -— I don't think that the younger peo-
ple get the kick out of it that they used to. I'm not sure what
it is. I just get that impression.”

He realizes that 90 is pretty old to still be going to the office,
but he has no plans to retire. ”I have operated machines all
through my life,” he said. ”I know machines, and I know how
to produce them.”

Even though he has been around. juke boxes for his entire

career, he does not have one in his home.

"When I built the house, I made provisions for a juke box,”
he said. ”I had speakers installed in the ceilings of every room,
and I had the wiring put in. But at the last minute, Mrs. Rock-
ola said no. She said, ‘You get enough of juke boxes at the fac-
tory. We~don’t need one here.’ So I ended up not having one
delivered.” . , 5

WASHINGTON — Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop told a
House panel Tuesday that he be-
Iieves. network television adver-

tising of condoms would help -

prevent the spread of AIDS.
Koop did not mention condom
advertising in his prepa_red

presentation to the health and en-‘

vironment subcommittee of the
House Energy and Commerce
Committee, but supported it
when asked by.Rep. Henry A.
Waxman (D-Calif.) the panel
chairman.

“The threat of AIDS is so great
that it overwhelms other con-
siderations and advertising,”
_Koo_p said.

June E. Osborn, dean of the
School of Public Health at the
University of Michigan, followed
Koop and said the use of con-
doms to prevent the spread of
AIDS ”stands out as a realistic
strategy of great importance, and
we should be using all available
media and avenues of communi-
cations to convey that important
fact to the public.”

She said AIDS ”threatens ‘a
whole new generation of adoles-
cents, among them possibly your
children and mine — and soon
no one in our society will be un-
touched by the pathos associated

- with this dreadful disease.

”Matters will get at least 10
times worse in the next five years,
even if we do everything right
and bring further spread of the vi-
rus under control,” she said.

Under questioning, Koop ac-
knowledged that condoms are
not a foolproof means to prevent
the spread of AIDS, just as they
are not a foolproof contraceptive.
But he added that ”with all the
failures and drawbacks, it's the
only thing we have in the way of

a barrier.”

_ He said he envisioned condom
advertising that would promote
health, not sex, and that it would
be helpful to structure some ads
to appeal to specific groups at
risk.

For example, he. said that 25
percent of AIDS cases are among

blacks, although they make up '
only 12 percent of the popula-

tion, and that 14 percentof the
cases-are among Hispanics,
although they make up only 6
percent of the population.

AIDS is a contagious disease
that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of
resisting other diseases and in-
fections. _ I

Although the chief victims of
AIDS have been homosexual
men and intravenous drug users,
the disease is spreading into other
groups. Health officials estimate
that heterosexual contact is
responsible for 4 percent of cases
and that I to 1.5 million Ameri-
cans have been exposed to the
virus. ‘

Civilrights
reforms    
advocated
by Berry

"By Lisa _Hallman

For The Pitt News

Dr. Mary Frances Berry, Profes-
sor of‘history and law at Howard
University in Washington, D.C.,
said there is a greater need for fur-

ther commitment to the civil
rights movement. Berry present- _

ed the second lecture in the Black
Action Society's lecture series

Monday in honor of Black Histo-

ry Month.

Berry, a commissioner on the
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
since 1980, said blacks have only

-had real legal freedom for the

past 22 years and that cameonly
as the result of struggle.
According to Berry, the civil

rights ,.,si_tua,t_io_n_ has worsened _,
since the late 1970s and more re--

cently, under the Reagan ad-
ministration. She said this has
been evidenced by‘ the attack on

three blacks in Queens, N.Y., and

the Ku Klux Klan demonstration
in Maryland on Martin Luther
King Jr.’s birthday.

Berry, former assistant secretary E

for education in the U.S. Depart-
ment of Health, Education and
Welfare, said blacks -are sti|l.por—
trayed in a bad light, even as we
celebrate the bicentennial of our
Constitution.

”We haven't made the
progress we should have,” Berry
said. She said blacks have
suffered a ”lack of freedom” for
over 300 years.

The civil rights issue can im-
prove, but citizens must take
responsibility, said Berry. She

also said the government needs

Report claims contras usingi

selective killing against ’foes’

By, George Gedda

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — The Nicara-
guan Contra rebels engage in
”selective but systematic killing”
of perceived opponents and in
the widespread kidnapping of
civilians, including children, ac-

- cording to a report released

today.

Americas Watch, aliberal New
York-based group, also said the
Nicaraguan government must
make‘ greater efforts to investigate
alleged abuses by the military
and to try those responsible. The
report said the Sandinista govern-
ment does not engage in a pattern
of violations of the laws of war.

The 166-page report calls for a
halt in U.S. funding for the Con-
tras and accuses the Reagan ad-
ministration of distorting the facts
by portraying the Sandinista
government in the most negative
terms and the insurgents in the
most favorable light.

”No attempt whatsoever is
made to moderate such portray-
als in the light of actual perfor-
mance,” the report said.

At a news conference, Ameri-
cas Watch vice chairman, Aryeh
Neier, said the group was unable
to detect any improvement in the
human rights performance of the
Contras.

However, he declined to say

.. whether the Sandinistas ‘or the

Contras are more guilty of rights
abuses. To take such a stand, he
said, would tend to diminish the
importance of the abuses com-
mitted by the side found to be

less guilty.

The study is the 10th by Ameri-
cas Watch on the subject of hu-
man rights in Nicaragua. It covers
the period from February-
December 1986 and was based
on a number of fact-finding trips
to the country. ’

\Americas Watch was estab-
lishedin1981 to monitor human
rights in South and Central
America and the Caribbean.

The Reagan administration has
accused Americas Watch of be-
ing biased in its previous reports
on human rights performance in
Nicaragua and elsewhere.

While criticizing both sides in

the Nicaraguan‘ conflict, the
report suggests that most of the
atrocities over the past year were
committed by the Contras.

The report said the Nicaraguan
government engages, as a matter
of policy, ”in abusive interroga-
tion tactics against prisoners, in-

cluding psychological pressure —

and threats used to secure their
confessions.” -

However, the government re-

cently has undertaken some ac-
tions that may put a stop to other
practices, including the use of
small cells, sleep deprivation and
food and water deprivation, the
study said. .

PROVIDENCE, R.l. — The '
man in the merchant marine
garb has just suggested to the
12 of us stranded at Newark
International Airport that we
start a riot.

We are standing around
Gate .48 wondering how we
lwillfind our way to Provi-
dence as the jet assigned to

carry us there leaves the

ground and streaks toward '
New England.

Flight attendants scramble for
a supervisor to find the answer
to our plight as patience

_ wanes.

One man stabs at his all-
purpose computer and__tells us
there are no more flights going
to Providence on any airline.
Our only choice is a flight to
Boston and a bus down to
Providence’. ‘"

Welcome to Continental
Airlines. ,

If the Wright brothers
knew what Continental
Airlines would do to the
process of flying, they might
have stayed in the bicycle
business and saved us all the
trouble. Lord knows a bicycle
would have been faster.

With all due respect to Con-
tinental, they have just taken
over the once-proud People)?-
press Airline. With all dis-
respect to Continental, they
have done a rather poor job of
it.

Our savior was a female
flight attendant with a name
tag identifying her as.S. _Cardil-
Io. Her answer to our woes
was a small airline located
down a dark corridor of the

We took it to a basketball

We took off with the

fighting his way‘to the cockpit.

We had gotten on the plane
before he did.

pick up the luggage after we
had gone through a complex
process of investigation to find
out where it was. '

This involved several phone
calls to Continental. During
one call, Chris Sepesy turned
to me and said, ''I'm talking to
Omaha, Nebraska.”

In the end, we did get to the
Civic Center in Providence to
cover a rather uneventful
basketball game.

The cab drivers that took us
there knew the name of the
airline before we could say it.

"We have no luggage, and
we're several hours late,"
Chris said to the driver.

2 "Continental?" the driver

‘-3.

B said. ''I just gave a ride to a

guy who lost his luggage with "
them.” ’

I'm probably writing this
only because there is nothing
more frustrating than a poor
‘airline. The fact is there is ab-
solutely nothing you can do
but wait for them to guide you
to the right place.

In the meantime, we'll-just
think about C0ntinental's fasci-
nation with Newark. You fly to
Newark regardless of where
you're going —— even points
west of Pittsburgh.

The high-tech world has
given us many wonderful
things. ‘But people still run it,

PA SATsc0res up nine points

those of many other states-, the
U.S. Education Department said

Pennsylvania's 894 average
was up one point over 1985,
when the state ranked 13th.

The'1986 national average was
906, the same as in 1985. New
Hampshire (935) and Oregon
(930) led the nation, while South
Carolina (826) and North Caroli-
na (835) were at the bottom.

In a statement accompanying
the state-by-state statistics, Educa-
tion Secretary William Bennett
noted Pennsylvania has hiked its
SAT scores nine points since

available, Pennsylvania's high
school graduation rate in 1985
was 77.2 percent, placing the
state 14th in the country. The
77.2 percent was the same as in
1984. The U.S. average was 70.6
percent.

In percentage of impoverished
children between ages 5 and 17,
Pennsylvania placed 28th, with
13.2 percent. The national aver-
age was 15.3 percent. But the
Education Department cautioned
that those figures were from
1980.

The state Education Depart-
ment in Harrisburg had not seen
the new figures and had no im-
mediate comment on how Penn-
sylvania fared, spokesman Don
Bowie said. With a new adminis-
tration led by Gov. Robert P.

 

 

Casey, the state is likely to have
a new set of education initiatives
for the coming year, Bowie said.
Several states that ranked near
the top in SAT performance also
placed high on the list in local
money used for schools. For ex-
ample, New Hampshire (90 per-
cent) led the nation in local
money as a percentage of over-
all state, federal and local educa-
tion contributions.
Pennsylvania's 49.4 percent
was 24th in the country in local

contributions. Of the remaining 1

50.6 percent of the school
money, the state provided 46 per-

cent and the federal government

4.6 percent.

In average teacher salaries,
Pennsylvania's $25,853. was
ranked 17th. The national aver-
age was $25,313.

‘ A

ous form of diabetes and when,
experts say.

While a battery of blood tests
would be used at first in close
relatives of‘diabetics, they could
apply to the public once scientists
find a treatment to prevent the
disease from appearing, said Dr.
Noel MacLaren, pathology
professor at the University of"
Florida College of Medicine at
Gainesville.

' The prospect of such a screen-
ing test, being pursued in many
laboratories, already has doctors,
the public,‘ government regulators

and venture capitalists calling the’

American Diabetes Association
foradvice.

”|t’s an incredible amount of
interest and controversy,” said

Richard Kahn,~the association's.»

assistant executive vice president
for scientific and medical affairs.
Currently the association op-

_poses random population screen-

ing, he said Friday.

No cost—effective screening
method has been found, he said,
and ”it’s not clear that there is a
safe, effective and inexpensive in-
tervention strategy” to prevent di-
abetes from appearing.

One concern, he said, is that
the tests might falsely predict di-
abetes for some people, subject-
ing them needlessly to the risk oi
serious side effects of attempts to
head off the disease.

The work focuses on insulin-
dependent diabetes, which usual-
ly appears in childhood or

adolescence and afflicts about 1 L
million of America's 11 million

diabetics. It requires daily insulin
injections, because the body does
not generate insulin to control
blood sugar levels. -

That results from a misguided
attack on insulin-producing cells
ofwthe pancreas by the body's im-
mune system, scientists say.

The attack starts long before

"symptoms of diabetes appear. By

the time the disease is diagnosed,
maybe 90 percent of the insulin-
producinglcells are dead, MacLa-
ren said Friday. _

So he _is studying blood tests to

find signs of diabetes that appear
before the disease itself.
‘ In three years, enough should
be known about various ex-
perimental tests to allow better
predictions than they give now,
he said.

Big time
Pitt beats SU,
alone in first place

By Joe Zeff

Associate Editor

Sherman Douglas had eight
seconds to rearrange the Big
East basketball standings Mon-
day night at the Civic Arena.

Syracuse trailed Pitt 63-61,
as,Douglas brought the ball
down the court. He drove the
sideline and passed to team-
mate Greg Monroe, who stood
unguarded at the corner. Pitt's
Rod Brookin started toward
the ball, but not before Mon-

A roe released his shot — an un-

obstructed three-point attempt
which would settle a first-
place tie between the confer-
ence leaders.

The ball bumped the front of
the rim as time expired, leav-
ing the Panthers without a
roommate atop the Big East
standings for the first time this
season.

’’If Monroe would have
made that shot,” said Brookin,
”l'would have hadto go to the
bathroom real bad.”

Instead, Brookin had to go
to the interview room, where
reporters from across the East
Coast wanted a word with the

v Panthers, ranked 10th in the
« latest AP rankings with 20-4

and 9-2 records. Syracuse,
19-4, 8-3, is the ninth-ranked
team in the country.

The triumph was not
without its tribulations, as the

Panthers made 39 percent of

their shots.

’’I don't think we shot that
poorly all season,” Pitt coach
Paul Evans said. ”Whenever
you win a game like that and
shoot the way we did, you're
very fortunate." ,

Jerome Lane, a 6-5 forward,
led the Panthers with 21
points and 14 rebounds. He
had 26 points and 15 re-
bounds when Pitt defeated
Syracuse, 84-70, -two weeks
ago at the Carrier Dome.

’’I think this makes us the
favorite to win the confer-
” Lane said. ’’I don't
think we're going to slump.
We" played bad tonight, and

Charlie Smith, or we can't win

- tage of that.”

we still won, so just think
when we're at our peak. -
We're going to blow teams
out.” '

It looked as if Syracuse
would blow out Pitt as the
Orangemen led 10-3 after five
minutes. Rony Seikaly, a 6-10
center, scored the opening six
points on offensive rebounds.
Seikaly finished with 19 points
and 11 rebounds.

”Seikaly was kind of in-
timidating me,” Lane said,
”because he was much taller
than me.”

But Brookin, a freshman,
helped resuscitate Pitt with
seven points during the first
half. He made two jumpshots
to start a 10-point scoring
streak, during which fon/vard
Demetreus Gore hit a 17-foot
jumpshot with 3:50 left to give
the Panthers their first lead,
21-20. J .

Five points ahead at half-
time, Pitt concentrated on
stopping Syracuse inside, "leav-
ing Douglas and Monroe open
to combine for 20 second-half
points. The Orangemen
regained the lead 43-42 with
12 minutes remaining.

Lane responded with eight
points in five minutes, includ-
ing three baskets that followed
offensive rebounds. Lane, who
leads NCAA Division I re-
bounders with 13.1 a game,
finished with 11 offensive
boards.

”The one thing with Jerome
Lane,” Syracuse coach Jim
Boeheim said, ”he’s a great re-
bounder and a great athlete,
but we have to double-team

the ballgame. We've got to
leave him open sometimes,
and he's going to take advan-

Lane did.

”When it comes to big
games,” Lane said, ’’I’m ready ‘
for them every time.” 1

He made one of two free
throws to tie the game 61-61
with 1:23 remaining. Smith
added the winning points —

”We played bad,” said sopho-
more ‘forward ierome Lane,
whose rebounding prowess is
worth much more than the price
of admission.

Lane once again controlled the
game inside, scoring 16 second-
half points (21 for the game) and
grabbing 14 rebounds, including
an incredible 11 on the offensive
end. . ‘

But besides the consistently
strong play of Lane, Pitt didn't
have another player with a great
individual night —— although
center Charles Smith came close

. _ scoring 12 points and adding 12

rebounds and seven blocks.
But, with this talented team,

, great individual efforts are no

longer needed to claim victories.
With Aiken and Gore combin-
ing for~only 11 points and the

team shooting a horrendous 39.3 A

percent from the floor against a
team with Syracuse's ability, one
would think the Panthers might
just crumble.

”When you win a game that
close and shoot the way we did,
I think you're fortunate,” said Pitt
coach Paul Evans.

Boeheim has another theory as
to why Pitt was ab|e_to win this

-game and 19 others previous to

it this year. ”They’re a year older.
They're making the shots at the

end [of games] now. You can't .

win games in the Big East when
your freshmen and sophomores,”
said Boeheim. ”A tremendous
amount of pressure was put on
this program -— two years too ear-
Iy. The Pittsburgh media's expec-

tations were totally, totally’

unrealistic.” 4

But, while Boeheim likes to
talk about Pitt's maturity and un-
realistic hopes of the past, the
Panthers like to speak of a win-
ning attitude, which is known to
infect teams that win close con-

tests, as Pitt hasdone so far this‘
season against Kansas, Akron, Se-

ton Hall, Villanova and now
Syracuse. - ,

”We’re playing to win instead
of [playing] not to lose,” said
Gore, who only had six points on
the night but one beatifully or-
chestrated, leaning, driving layup
over 6-10 Syracuse center Rony
Seikaly. — _

”We did what it took to win,”

,.,~AL.,.1«..[. .,.. .,. -,......,.,..... ,

added Gore. ”We’re concentrat-
ing more [this year].’' '

But, the one man who had the
most to concentrate on was
Smith. With 12 seconds left and
the score tied at 61-61, Pitt fresh’-
man forward Rodney Brookin
missed a 10-foot baseline jumper.
Smith grabbed the rebound and
was subsequently fouled, sending
him to the foul line for a one-and-
one with eight ticks Ieft on the
clock. _

A chance for redemption for
the All—American, who was a goat
three weeks before at Fitzgerald
Field House when he missed a
10-foot jumper with three sec-
onds left -— a shot that would
have beaten St. John's. Following
that game, Smith proceeded to
skip the post-game interview
session.

Tl_'l‘E PITT NEWS, Wed.nesd<:Iy, Februarylll, I987

Boeheiim thinksmaturity is key for Pitt.

 

Core, for one, knew _ Smith
would come through on this cru-
cial one-and-one. ”There was no
question. It was money,” said
Gore. ”Charles told me he never
had any doubt.”

Said Smith, ’’I wasn't nervous,

‘ bécauséﬁfi would have been, I

probably would have missed.”
Smith was 4-14 from the field
in that humiliating loss to St.

.John's, and he missed. the one

that could have won it. Monday
night he was an equally dismal
4-13 from the floor, but he scored

the two clutch _points in the big-’

gest game Pitt's ever played in the
Big East. ‘ .

Now, the Panthers control their
own fate. With five regular sea-
son games left, Pitt could very
well be looking at a Big East regu-

The Pitt Panthers may be in first
place in the Big East Conference
at the moment, but don't count
Syracuse, St. John's and George-
town out of the race for the title
just yet.

Pitt head coach Paul Evans is

worried about one team in par-
ticular. ”St. John's has a hell of an
advantage. They have most of
their remaining games at home,”
said Evans. . . . .
v After defeating ~Seton'Ha|l' in
East Rutherford, N.J. last night by
a score of 60-5 Z the Redmen (8-4
in Big East play) have six games
left — and all of them are at
home.

The Redmen host Pitt on Feb.
28 at Alumni Hall in New York
and that game could very well
decide the Big East regular season
champion.

* * *

Pitt played its last three games
in only six days. Taking into con-
sideration that two of those
games were on the road and all

_ three went down to the wire, the

Panthers have reason to be fa-
ﬁgued.

Evans gave the players Tuesday
off, and said they would only go
through a light workout today.
Said Evans: ”It’s a blessing. Hav-
ing two days off will be nice.”'

* * *

Panther center Charles Smith

broke his own Pitt shot—blocking -

record in the Syracuse game.
Smith had seven blocks against
the Orangemen, increasing his
season total to 86. Last year Smith.

NOTEBOOK

set the Pitt season record with 81

‘blocks.

* * *

Quote of the Month: When
Pitt forward Jerome Lane was

asked what team in the Big East-

worried him the most he said,

. . "G.€.0r8,E’.'I.QW.“.SCa.T€§.U5 the most
because we want to beat St.

John's and Syracuse so bad that
it ain't even funny.”

I haven’t quite figured out what
that means, but I'm not complain-
ing. With the way ”Rome” is
playing, no one can argue with

 

  Big East titlechase isstillfar from overl

anything he says.
* * _*

Pitt's seven—game win streak is
the team's longest since the
1978-79 season when the Pan-
thers rattled off nine consecutive
victories.

* * *

Although there are still three

weeks left in the regular season, ' 

the nominees for first team All-
Big East are in (at least in this
writer's poll), and here are the
results: Guards — Mark Jackson
of St. John's and Billy Donovan
of Providence; Forward.s.%'. Reg-
gie Williams of Georgetown and
Pitt's Lane; Center —- the Pan-
thers’ Smith.

By Matt O'Hara
Staff Writer

Pitt Lady Panther basketball
‘head coach Kirk—Bruce decided
Monday to suspend junior point
guard Valerie Halesworth for the
remainder of the season.

. \ Neither Bruce nor Halesworth
would comment on the reason
for her suspension. Bruce and

Halesworth would only say that
the decision was ”best for the
team.”

Added Bruce, ”I have 10 girls
who want to play, and that's
about all I want to say about the
Halesworth thing.”

”He’s the coach, and if he
thinks this is best for the team, I
wish them luck,”
Halesworth.

Halesworth’s suspension actu-
ally started last weekend, when
she was held off the team trip to
Syracuse for a Saturday afternoon
gam 3. I

The loss of Halesworth, one
of the team's best players, can
only cause more problems for a
-team that is 5-17 overall and 0-12
in the Big East.

- Halesworth started 17 of 21
games this year and was averag-
ing 29.5 minutes per game.
Halesworth was also averaging
8.8 points per game and had 89
assists but a staggering 103 tur-
novers.

At the beginning of this season,
Bruce told The Pitt News ’’I am
really looking for Valerie to run
the team.”

”Coach said he wants me to be
an extension of him on the floor,”
said Halesworth during an inter-
view recently.

Now, however, Bruce is not

said '

even sure if Halesworth will be
welcomed back next year. I

Perhaps Bruce is dissatisfied
with Halesworth’s execution of
her role as a tri-captain, a position
voted on by team members.

Whatever the "reason,
Halesworth is no longer on the
team. She does plan on returning
to the university next year,
regardless of her status with the
Lady Panthers.

Bruce recently said that the
team is trying to get some
momentum going into the Big
East Tournament (Feb. 26 -to
March 1 at Villanova University).

The loss of Halesworth has trig-
gered different reactions among

. her teammates. Unfortunately, no

one wishes to comment, because
as one player, who asked not to
be identified, said, ”We’re going
through enough right now.”

Bruce started freshman Karen
Threatt against Syracuse in place
of Halesworth, and he said he
plans to go with her the re-
mainder of the season.

Ha|eworth’s suspension marks
the second player to leave the
team this year. Jenny Tyner, 6-5
senior center, voluntarily quit the
team on Jan. 9. Tyner was appar-
ently upset over a lack of playing
time.

The Lady Panthers are current-
ly headed for their worst record
in the team's 13-season history.

Among the Big East teams re-
maining on Pitt's schedule
(Boston College, St. John's, Seton
Hall and Providence), the aver-
age margin of loss from previous
meetings this year is 26 points.

Wrestlers defeat Kent State at fieldhouse

By Vince Carey

Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther wrestling team
manhandled Kent State, 30-15,
last night in front of a small Fitz-
gerald Field House crowd.

The win improved Pitt's record
to 10-2 overall and 2-2 in the
Eastern Wrrestling League.

’ ’’It was a good performance,”
said Pitt head coach Rande Stott-
lemyer. ”We started off kind of
slow, but the. middle was very

good. Another reason for the big

win was that our guys are used to ‘

better competition. We couldn't
take them lightly, but we have
wrestled better teams."

The Golden Flashes started off
well by taking the first two
matches. At the 118—division
KSU’s Mark Adkins faced Pitt's
Matt Rizzo in a hotly contested
bout. It was close all the way to
the, end. With one minute’ left in
the match, Adkins was awarded
two points — enough to claim the

win.

Pitt's Brian O’Korn lost the next
match and Kent State had a 6-0
lead. A calm swept over the
crowd as another loss loomed on
the horizon.

The high flying Flashes were
then brought back to earth when
Pitt's Alan Utter took the next
match, putting the Panthers on a
roll that would eventually capture
the meet. '

”The middle of our line-up
wrestled very good tonight," said

 

WE ’ VE A DDEMD A V out  

Morsholl Clark/The Pitt News 

senior Eric Wertz. ”Pat [Santoro],
Gary [Bolin] and Jeff Turner did
a real good job.” '

At the 142-division Pitt's San-
toro wasted no time in taking care
of his opponent. Behind 2-O, San-
toro erupted and pinned his man
with only less than two minutes
gone in the match. This gave Pitt
a 9-6 lead and it never looked
back.

The most exciting match of the
night took place next. Pitt's Gary
Bolin [13-3-1 on the season]
squared, off with KSU’s Dave
Yerse -[20-7-1 on the season].
Both wrestlers came out fighting,
and it was tied at the end of the

first period. Bolin led by one at.

the end of the second and this set
up an exciting third period.
-Both wrestlers started offthe
third period strong, as the lead
went’ back and forth. Then with
one minute remaining Bolin took
an 8-4 lead. It stayed that way un-
til there were only 10 seconds
left. Bolin went on the attack and

was able to get Yerse on his back.

Time was slipping away as Bolin
tried to pin Yerse. It didn’t_ look
as if he was going to be able to
do it. Then, with a sudden burst

of strength, he rolled the guy over '

and was awarded the pin at the
buzzer. _ . . ..

.where to apply. This list includ-
ed good academics, Division I
gymnastics and a school close to
home.

”There was just nothing in
New York which met all of my
priorities,” said Aser. Thus, she
had to drop the idea of going to
a college close to" her home from
her list.

But the fact that Pitt would give
her a full scholarship did help

sway her decision to attend the
school. ”I give a lot of credit to
Donna Sanft [the gymnastic
coach in 1986] who decided to
offer me the scholarship,” she
said. -

Coach Yohman also is happy
for this decision. ”Trish started
out this season a little slow,” she
said. ”But now she's picked up
speed and confidence. I'm con-
fident she'll pull through the rest
of the season.”

Wrestling

continued from page 17
Bolin. ”l was a little tense at the
start, but I started to relax as the
match went on. This was a good
warm up for the Penn State meet
on Saturday.”

Pitt's Jeff Turner was able to
pull off the third straight pin of the
night at 1.58. Going into the third
period, Turner was behind 3-2,
and it didn't look as if the Kent
State wrestler was going to give
him a chance to make up that
one point. Then, with 40 seconds
left, Turner spun his man over,
and 10 seconds later was award-
ed the pin. The Panthers now led
21-6.

”I felt good out there tonight,”
said Turner. ‘'1 have been work-
in‘g hard and it showed tonight.

-Aser striving to meet her personalgoals

Aser’s goal for this season,
other than competing in the all-
around, is to take an All-East title
at the regional finals in April. In
the last two meets in which the
Lady Panthers have competed,

Aser placed first on the floor rou-

tine each time. She is quickly
closing in on her goal.

Aser, along with the Lady Pan-
thers Gymnastic team, will com-
pete on Saturday at Temple
University.

I just went out and wrestled as
hard as I could. I got a little tired
at the end but was able to pull it
out.”

Pitt took the next two matches
rathereasily. Wertz, wrestling at
one weight class higher than
usual, blew his man away, win-
ning the 167-lb match, 17-3. This
win gave the Panthers five team
poin_ts and put the team score out
of reach. .

’’I had a little bit of a cold
tonight,” said Wertz. ”That’s why
I moved up a weight. I ran out of
steam at the end because of it.”

Panther Mike Tongel con-
tinued Pitt's dominance, winning
the 177-Ibmatch, 13-2.

KSU took the final two matches
of the evening to make the final
score 30-15.

Cheerleaders adjust to difficult situation  

By G.B. Patterson
Staff Writer

if you were at the Pitt-Syracuse
game on Monday night, you saw
the Pitt cheerleading squad at hal-
ftime perform the routine that
gained them national recognition
as one of the top cheerleading
squads in the nation.

Last month, the Pitt squad
traveled to Miami to compete in
the U.S. Collegiate Cheerleader
Championships. You've seen this
event before on ESPN. This com-
petition is an invitational event
where only the top cheerleading

squads from around the country. '
try to outdo each other in a com- ,
. bination of cheers, dance, gym-

nastics and partner stunts.
The Pitt squad was fine—tuned

' when it left the Pittsburgh Inter-

national .Airport at 8:32 on a
Thursday morning.

The squad arrived in Miami
and began to practice the routine
on which they had spent 10 to 15
hours a week for the past two
months.

 

This was it. This was the Na-
tionals. This was the only time
the Pitt squad could gain any
recognition for all of its efforts.
You see, Pitt doesn't have athlet-
ic scholarships for cheerleading,
as do most colleges which have
squads that compete on a nation-
al level.

On Friday, each of the squads

. selected for competition gave a

demonstration at the Miami Sea-
quarium, the host of the event.
Then the squads were given time
to practice their routines and get
used to the stage where they
would eventually perform. '
After the day's events were
through, all the competing
squads returned to their hotel
with the.unofficial word that Pitt
was the squad to beat.
Saturday, the day of the actual
competition, couldn't have been
better suited for the event. It was
sunny and 86 degrees. There
were hundreds of people sur-
rounding the stage, most of
whom were either cheerleaders
themselves, coaches or part of the

The competition proved to be
outstanding, and the Pitt squad
accomplished more than any of
its members had ever hoped.

Specifically, Pitt was the third
group to perform. They came out
to a riotous crowd and set them-
selves. The music came on, and
the crowd was cheering along
with the squad as they made it
through the first major transition
of their routine. Then, it
happened.

The music shut off, and the
squad was left standing. One of
the guys had blown out his knee
catching his partner. It. was all
over. Everything for which the
squad hadworked was now un-
attainable. The other squads gave
both shouts of encouragement
and sighs of relief.

The shocked Panther squad

‘made their way off of the stage‘

and met their coach. Some mem-
bers sobbed.‘Others were silent.
Coach Theresa Nuzzo hadn't
given up. She asked the squad
what they could do without the
injured member, if they could
change the routineand perform
it again.

Suddenly the Panther squad
came back to life, and all of those
who had thrown.in the towel in-

events. ,

stantly realized that they could
come back. They modified the
routine for which they had prac-
ticed for so long in only 10
minutes. The judges allowed the

Pitt squad to return after the last
squad completed its routine.
Pitt came out, the entire place
erupted, and the Panthers wowed
’em. They made it through their

routine, modified as it was, and V

were given the loudest cheers of

the day. ‘ _

No, Pitt didn't win. A squad:

from Wichita won. But Pitt beat ,

the odds, came from behind,
pulled together — all that kind of
stuff.»Fathers call what they did

”building character.” Ernestjﬁw

Hemingway called what they did
’’grace . under pressure.”
Whatever it was, it was great.
There's no realistic way to con-
vey the feeling of what the Pitt
cheerleading squad did in Miami
without actually~being there.

Sure, they came back from adver- A . '

sity and excited a crowd. But it ‘

wasn't so much what they did, as

the mere fact that they did it.'And ’

they won more than a trophy.
They won a feeling that can be
experienced only once, if ever, in

a lifetime. To move from total '_

physical and mental dejection to
complete jubilation is what the
Pitt squad did, which may have
been even better than winning.
