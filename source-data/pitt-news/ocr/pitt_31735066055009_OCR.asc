Dalai Lama in Piﬂshurgh

Lisa Grzyboski
Staff Wrlter

The lines of people began ﬂooding
Sixth Street in front of Heinz Hall in
Downtown Pittsburgh to see the Dalai Lama
long before the suggested 7:30 am. arrival
time on the ticket. ’

Pitt juniors Ilene Ravich and Jenny
Rising were two of the more than 2,680
waiting to enter the hall on the bitter cold
Thursday moming. They caught an early

A bus Downtown, hoping to beat the bnmt of

the crowd waiting for security clearance to
the event. After all, it’s not every day the
spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism comes
to town, and they didn’t want to miss a sec-
ond of his teaching.

“Whatever he has to say will be mean-
ingful,” said Rising. _

Both women are interested in practicing
Buddhism and co11ldn’t wait to hear the
Dalai Lama’s insight into the Heart Sutra —
one ofT1betan Buddhism’s most sacred texts
and one Buddhist scholars have spent cen-
turies attempting to unravel.

“The [Buddhist] philosophy is interest-
ing,” said Ravich. “It is very peaceful, not
forceful in the "least. Whenever I’ meet a
Buddhist, they don’t try to press [their
beliefs] on you. They don’t try to force pam-
phlets in your han ”

The peaceful recorded prayer chants set
the scene as ticket holders entered the ornate
hall. Buddhist monks dressed in robes sat
cross-legged upon cushions on the stage,
meditating to the deep-ﬂrroated, extended

“Om” and the wafts of sweet-smelling
incense occasionally spiraling upward to
people inthe balcony seats.

Shortly after two bomb—sniﬁ"er dogs
checked behind stage, under cushions and
beneath the large prayer rug decorating the
center portion of the stage, the spiritual and
political leader of Tibet ambled onstage to
begin his lecture.

“Firstly, I want to speak a few things,”
said the 14th Dalai Lama in broken English.
‘My main effort wherever I go is to make
clear the value of human beings.”

The title “dalai lama” means “ocean of
wisdom.” Tibetans believe the bearers of this
title are manifestations of the Boddhisattva
of Compassion, an enlightened being who
chooses to be reborn repeatedly to serve all
beings.

Before. his teaching on the Heart Sutra

' began, the Dalai Lama focused on the need
‘ to ﬁnd happiness and tranquility in life, as

well as the importance of looking inward for
compassion and forgiveness. The 63-year-
old also said it’s better for people to have

some kind of faith, whether it is Buddhism, I I

Christianity or another belief system, than to
believe in no higher being at all.
“Unexpected tragic things happen,” the
Dalai Lama said ‘‘[They]- cause people to
look to-deeper things  spiritual things.”

The -Kappa Sigma fraternity on
Friday filed its appeal of Pitt’s deci-
sion to suspend it for one year for vio-
lating" the University’s policy on off-
campus fraternity housing.

The University enacted the policy

in February after numerous arrests and

difﬁculties with other fraternities.

“The policy says that any student
organization that wishes to have a
house to live in or a facility to hold
meetings must be located within cam-
pus boundaries,” said Pitt spokesman
Ken Service. .

In August, Kappa Sigma moved

into its house on 245. North Dithridge
St., knowingly violating the policy.
' Kappa Sigma President Nick
Moraites said, “Our stance was that,
yes, we were violating [Pitt’s] rule, but
they do not have the right to make that
rule.”

I The house is zoned by the city as a
fraternity house, said Moraites. He
said that any fraternity has the right to
live . at the residence and that the

University is violating that right. Only

fraternities can live in the house unless
its re-zoned by the city zoning board.

Moraites said Greek adviser Kerry ‘

Daley notified him Monday that the
fratemity’s status had been revoked.

Pitt suspended
the Kappa
Sigma
fraternity for
living in this
North Oakland
house. The
fraternity filed

its appeal on
Friday.

Moraites said he was contacted
because the University wanted to
announce the decision to the media.

Because the fratemity’s status has
been revoked, the chapter can no
longer promote itself on campus,
recruit new members on campus prop-
erty, or use office space in the William
Pitt Union.

Because of the suspension, Kappa
Sigma can not participate in any Greek
events on campus, including

_ February’s rush.

“It’s really to our advantage,”
Moraites said. “We can rush on our
own, whenever we want. We don’t
have to wait until the University tells
us we can.”

But Kappa Sigma no longer has
the privilege of free advertising
through the Greek system and will
have to pay for advertising space if it
wants it.

Dennis: Donham, the vice chancel-
lor of student affairs, said the
University is unable to comment on
the situation because the fratemityt has
ﬁled an appeal and anything he has to
say on the subject could be interpreted
as prejudicial.

I “The fraternity has a right to a fair
hearing,” Donham said.

Kappa Sigma filed the appeal

Whether the candidates for stu-‘

dent government can represent all
sectors of Pitt’s diverse population
without-bias_ has become an issue in
this year’s campaign, as evidenced by
repeated questions to the effect during
the Meet the Candidates forum last
week.

Several candidates are members
of special-interest groups, some of
which consist of mostly minorities,

‘leading some students to wonder

"whether those candidates, as leaders,
will be able to focus on the student
body as a whole.

On the other hand, some ques-
tioned whether candidates who were
not affiliated ‘with minority groups

would be able to address minority .

concerns.
Board candidates Nicole
Showalter and Raymond Murphy are
running on the same slate, “Evolve.”
Showalter is president of the Campus
Women’s. Organization, and Murphy
is president of the Rainbow Alliance.
“I definitely always have the con-
cerns of women in mind,” said

Showalter, who has labored all semes-
ter to rebuild a struggling CWO.
Toward the end of the forum,
Murphy remarked that approximately
two-thirds of the Oakland campus

UPMC doctor develops
carpal tunnel treatment

Kelly Ruane
Staff Writer

A new technique is being used to help
relieve pain for people who suffer from
severe recurring carpal tunnel syndrome.

Orthopedic surgeons at the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center are perform-
ing a new procedure in which‘ a person’s
vein is wrapped around the nerves
involved with carpal tunnel syndrome to
insulate them from
recurrent compres-
sion and development
of painful scar tissue
formed by earlier
unsuccessful surgical
procedures.

Carpal tunnel
syndrome is the most
common type of com-
pressed nerve condi-
tion, according to Dr.
Dean Sotereanos,
associate professor of
orthopedic surgery at.
UPMC.

The condition
affects one in 10 peo-
ple and includes
symptoms such as

well as numbness and
fingers, wrist and

shoot through the
upper arm.

Pain associated with carpal tunnel
syndrome can become worse at night or
with increased activity of the hand. People
who suffer ﬁom this affliction are usually
people who perform repetitive and force-
ful movements, such as typing, with their
hands for long periods of time.

Carpal tunnel syndrome can also be
the result of a broken or dislocated wrist
bone, arthritis, thyroid conditions, dia-

A betes or, in females, various hormonal

changes.
Carpal tunnel syndrome develops

-, ﬁom compression of the median nerve,

which runs through the carpal tunnel to
the forearm, ﬁngers and hand. There are

 

He Said

tendons in the tunnel that are surrounded
with synovium, a smooth lubricating
membrane. When these tissues become
swollen and irritated, they compress the
median nerve, causing pain, tingling and
numbness.

For patients who continue to have
‘symptoms after treatments such as anti-

inﬂammatory steroid injections or wear-
ing a splint to rest the hand, the ligament
above the carpal tunnel can an be cut to
' relieve pressure. This
is a traditional proce-
dure.

“[Carpal turmel
syndrome] remains a
challenging problem
for surgeons,” said
Sotereanos.
“Between 14 and 32
percent of surgical
patients have recur-
rent symptoms and
require repeated
surgeries.”

Sotereanos and
his team perform the
vein-wrapping tech-
nique to try to get the
best results on
patients who have
had at least two
failed surgeries for
carpal tunnel syn-
drome.

During the
operation, the nerve
is freed from border-
ing scar tissue. A piece of the saphenous
vein, a vein close to the skin’s surface in
the lower leg, is taken and wrapped in
candy-striped fashion around the nerve.
This serves as an insulator from existing
scar tissue and prevents more from form-
mg.

Sotereanos and his team are the ﬁrst
and only surgeons in the world to perform
this technique using the patient’s own
vein.

, “Since initiating clinical studies for
this procedure in 1993, we have per-
formed the operation on 22 patients at
UPMC, 80 percent with good toexcellent
long-terrn results,” Sotereanos said.

Himalayan foothills. He was 15 when called
upon to assume his role as head of state after
China invaded Tibet’s sovereign borders.
Nine years later, after all attempts at peaceful
coexistence with the Chinese failed and on
the heels of reports of possible arrest and
irnprisomnent, the Dalai Lama ﬂed to neigh-
boring India in the middle of the night, never
to retum again.

But Tibet’s relationship with China was
not the topic of conversation at 8:45 in the
morning. People would have to wait until
later in the day for that. Instead, his morning
teaching centered on cultivating the knowl-
edge necessary to happiness. -

Speaking through a translator for most
of the spiritual lecture, the Dalai Lama said
that because everything comes into being as
a result of a set of causes and conditions,
nothing is independent in nature.

“The Buddha states that the person who
understands this interdependence is
releas ” the Dalai Lama said. _

He said that at the root of all negative
emotions lies a person’s self-ego. People
must let go of their selves and begin to think
of themselves not only as a small part of the
larger community but also as empty of their
own individual existence. The Dalai Lama
hastened to point out this does not mean per-
sonal identity doesn’t exist, but rather people

FROM PAGE 1

must put forth effort to reverse the consump-

tion of self.

‘He said compassion enhances people
and prepares them to become members of
the Buddhist family. For people to truly ﬁnd

liberation in compassion, they must aspire to
lessen others’ suifering. The only way to do
this, he said, is to understand the nature of
suffering and develop a sense of connected-
ness and ‘closeness to others.

“From the Buddhist point of view, even
though something may be pleasurable. and
desirable, it is still suﬂ"ering because there
still lies the possibility of dissatisfaction or
culmination of dissatisfaction,” the Dalai
Lama said. “The more ‘
a person pursues these
desires, the more he or
she becomes disillu-
sioned.”

He likened this
level of suﬁering to
buying a new car. At
ﬁrst, the owner takes
exceptionally good
care of it But as time
goes on and the person
gets used to it, the joy
is no longer there, and
the person actually

begins to doubt if the and ask him questions.

bigger and better things to ﬁnd the same sat-
isfaction. ;

The most intense level of suifering is
that of conditioning where a person is con-
stantly under the power of negative emo-

' l1OI'lS.

“So long as we are under the control of
negative emotions, we are suffering,” he
said. “Freedom from conditioning is true lib-
eration or cessation of sulfering.”

He went on to discuss the need for a
gradual approach to spiritual training and the
teaching of an abstract lesson on the connec-
tion between emptiness and form. He ended
his morning teaching by instructing every-
one present to “be good human beings.”

After the lecture, Ravich and Rising
couldn’t stop talking about what they
thought of the Dalai Lama and his teachings.
“It was different from what I thought it

Rising. “I thought

not.”

“Challenges and Ethics for the Next

Lama’s morning teaching and also bought a
ticket to his third lecture months ago because
of its political nature. ‘

“I came because of human rights,”
Belsky said. “I have an interest in human
rights, and in Tibet, I think it’s a situation
where they’re clearly being violated”

The Dalai Lama addressed over 6,000
people in tlnee events during his one-day
Pittsburgh stop. '

“He represents 25 percent of the world’s
population who are Buddhist,” said Judy
Nees, director of administrative affairs for
the World Aifairs Council, one of the organi-
zations that sponsored the Dalai Lama’s
visit. “You can imagine all the Buddhists in
this country, and there are 10 Buddhist
groups in Pittsburgh. I think it would be the
same thing if the Catholic pope came.”

Monte Broaded, coordinator of Pitt’s
Chinese studies program, thinks the Dalai
Lama’s popularity stems from something
more than his position as the spiritual leader
of Tibetan Buddhism.

“Tibet has been inserted into American
popular consciousness for a number of rea-
sons,” he said. “Richard Gere, for example,

‘ has taken up Tibet as an issue. There have

been many Hollywood ﬁlms recently about
the Dalai I_ama.'The Dalai Lama also
received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987.”

As for the question of the Dalai Lama’s
eventual return to his homeland, Broaded
said there are many factors to consider.

‘Thereisnotsomuchathreatonhis
life, but rather on his capacities to act as he
would like as the political and secular leader
of Tibet,” Broaded said “He would also like
more religious freedom.”

plans to step down from her BAS
office if she wins the student-govem-
ment election. Esrick McCartha, the
vice president of BAS, would step up
to fill the position, she said.

Ogunleye said that as BAS presi-
dent, she has worked extensively with
any student group on campus that
needed help. For example, she has
worked on projects with the CWO and
the Rainbow Alliance, neither of
which has dealt in depth with African-
American issues.

“We do not discriminate who we
work with,” Ogunleye said of BAS, a
theme she said she would carry into
her SGB presidency.

' Candidates who have not been
steadily affiliated with special-inter-
est groups also had to face scrutiny of
their ability to govern all students.

One member of the audience read
a question from a sheet of paper
accusing board candidate Julie
Radford of racism. The question

FROM PAGE 2

 

referred only to rumors and not to any
specific examples of racist behavior.

A visibly surprised and hurt
Radford retorted that any rumors link-
ing her to racism were blatantly false.
Radford, the chairwoman of SGB’s
Governmental Relations Committee,
listed initiatives that proved she is fair
to all groups. As the director of Pitt
TV, for instance, she has helped both
the CWO and the Rainbow Alliance
organize advertising.

Presidential candidate George
Mongell pointed out that as chairman
of SGB’s Academic Affairs
Committee, he has worked with BAS
on academic issues. .

Joan Snyder, a candidate for
board running with Mongell and
Radford on the “Your Voice” slate,
said she wants to develop weekly pro-
grams that bring student groups
together to work on team—building,
promote diversity and increase cam-
pus unity.

All Pitt students share a common
goal, she said: “We all want the best
college experience that we can have.”

No matter how stupid, Pitt’s
housing rules must be followed

Pitt suspended the Kappa
Sigma fraternity last week for
violating its off-campus housing
rule. Because the fraternity
moved into its off-campus house
in August, after the policy was
enacted in February, it was in
direct violation of the rule, which
was set up by Pitt to try to estab-
lish more control over Greek
activities.

Whether one agrees with
Pitt’s policy or not, the suspen-
sion is the right course of action.
Kappa Sigma broke a rule, know-
ing that it broke the rule, and for
that, the suspension was appropri-
ate.

If Pitt’s rules are to be taken
seriously, they will have to be
enforced. Kappa Sigma will
appeal the decision, but it is point-
less to have a rule and not punish
those who break it.

Of course, the rule pertaining
to off-campus housing is ridicu-
lous. If Pitt has no on-carnpus
housing for its fraternities, why
restrict them by mandating that
they not move off campus? .

Pitt said there were too many
fraternities living off campus, and
one of the reasons they’re being
restricted is Pitt’s concern over

, which allows

the way the fraternities conduct
their activities. Kappa Sigma was
not known for rowdy, drunken
behavior, though. The fraternity
members were actually praised by
most of their neighbors. The fra-
ternity contributed positively to
its community. But since Kappa
Sigma was not protected by the
policy’s “grandfather” clause —-
fraternities that
were living off campus before the
policy was put in place to stay
there —- it will no longer have the
luxury of living off campus.

In other words, Pitt wants to
tighten the leash on the fraterni-
ties and keep a closer eye on them
——- for the sake of telling parents
that the University where they’re
investing four years’ worth of
tuition maintains a strict policy on
student conduct, especially with
regard to alcohol consumption.

Although Pitt’s new policy is
hardly ideal for a fraternity, it is a
rule that should be abided never-
theless. Student groups that wish
to be affiliated with the
University have to follow its
rules. To operate under Pitt’s
umbrella, Kappa Sigma has to
follow Pitt’s rules, no matter how
ridiculous they are.

When "hypocritical" is not strong enough a word

Here’s the g;rand—prize question, readers:
Which country in the Middle East has a histo-
ry of mistreatment of minorities within its (as-
yet-undeclared) borders, aggression against its
neighbors, and refusal to withdraw from ill-
gotten territory in violation of UN resolutions,
and furthermore is the only country in the
region in possession of nuclear weapons?

It has been 12 years since Mordechai
Vanunu leaked information on the Israeli
nuclear-weapons program to a London news-
paper. After doing so, Vanunu was lured to
Rome and kidnapped there by Israeli Mossad
agents. He has been in prison ever since and
was in solitary conﬁnement until March of this
year; at more than 11 years, it was the longest
known time spent in solitary con-
ﬁnement by any prisoner in the

Vanunu, the courageous whis-
tle—blower, continues to rot in an
Israeli dungeon even as his country V
demands the release of a common spy whose
name does not deserve to occupy the same sen-
tence as Vanunu’s. (Israel’s request for the
release of Jonathan, Pollard has been greeted
with derision even by the sycophants at The
New Republic. Bill Clinton has nevertheless
promised to take it seriously. For your amuse-
ment, try to imagine the reaction which would
have greeted a hypothetical request by the
Soviet Union 15 years ago for the release of a
spy in exchange for Soviet “redeployment”
from a whopping 13 percent of Afghanistan.)

There must be a stronger adjective than
“hypocritical” to describe the insufferable pos-
turing of the United States, its allies and their
cretinous propagandists in the mainstream
media. Yet the thesaurus fails one in such
instances. Take some time to ponder the
depraved mentality of an individual who is
outraged when Islamic Jihad sets off bombs in
Tel Aviv in retaliation for the crimes of the
Netanyahu government, yet ﬁnds nothing
morally repugnant at the thought of the United
States dropping thousands of times as many
explosives on Baghdad in ostensible reply to
the crimes of Saddam Hussein. You, too, will
ﬁnd all the words in the English language inad-
equate. ,

The very real crimes of Saddam Hussein
have been exposed, suppressed and rediscov-
ered for the past two decades as the propagan-

da needs of U.S. elites have ﬂuctuated. The
Iraqi Kurds — who have more cause than any-
body to complain of the Iraqi regime’s
weapons of mass destruction ——- have been
sacriﬁced numerous times to U.S. “policy”
needs. As the Pike Commission of the Senate
found in 1976, the United States — with the
assistance of Israel and the shah of Iran —

trained and equipped Kurdish insurgents in .

northern Iraq beginning in 1973, not so the
Kurds would ultimately prevail, but only so
they would cause trouble for the regime. When
the shah and Saddam came to an understand-
ing in 1975, aid to the Kurds was abruptly ter-
minated, the regime carried out a bloody
crackdown, and the United States refused so
much as humanitarian relief for
refugees.
During the 1980s, the
United States supported Hussein in
his war against Iran, and when the
Iraqis dropped chemical weapons
on the Kurdish village of Halabja on March 16,
1988 —— killing some 5,000 people — the
United States claimed the attack had been car-
ried out by the Iranians. It was only when
Hussein became an oﬂicial enemy" again that
the United States discovered the propaganda
value of decrying his gassing of the Kurds. Just
in case any more proof of U.S. double-dealing
were needed, the United States currently sup-
plies the Turkish military in its brutal coun-
terinsurgency war against its own Kurds and
permits Turkish aircraft to cross the Iraqi bor-
der in violation of the “no-ﬂy zone” in order to
hunt down ﬂeeing Kurdish rebels.

It might be worth your while, then, to call
the State Department and ask for an explana-
tion of why Uncle Sam is making such a fuss
about weapons inspectors being foiled in Iraq
while its closest ally keeps one of its own (vol-
unteer) inspectors behind bars. Even better:
When the U.S. military visits ﬁery death upon
the people of Iraq, take the time to question
your public servants as to why no one has ever
thought to assign inspectors to ﬂie only nation
that has ever actually used nuclear weapons in
warfare. The experience, I would dare to con-
jecture, will be beyond words.

John lacny thinks it small consolation to the
Iraqi people that US. pilots are “only follow-
ing orders.”

Christians and capital punishment::t|1e ultimate temptation

Michael J. Mazza

Columnist

The case of Mumia Abu-Jamal has
focused tremendous international interest on
the death penalty in the United States. Abu-
Jamal, an award—winning Aﬁican-American
journalist, was convicted of the murder of
Philadelphia police ofﬁcer Daniel Faulkner
July 3, 1982; he was sentenced to death by
Judge Albert Sabo. ' ;

Sixteen years later, Abu—Jamal remains
on death row; awaiting execution. Over the
years, his cause has been advocated by sup-
porters who claim he is innocent of the
charge of which he was convicted; they have

‘sought to secure him a new trial. In fact,

Abu—Jamal’s own petition to the courts after
his conviction alleges no less than 22 sepa-
rate violations of rights and procedures that
occurred during his_ﬁrst trial!

Is Abu-Jamal truly an innocent man? I
do not know; but I do know that the words
of both Abu-Jamal and his advocates have
raised doubt in my mind as to the justice of
his conviction. I believe he deserves a new,
fair trial. ,

Those who scoﬂ° at Abu-Jarnal’s claims
of irmocence would be wise to consider the
case of Jeffrey Blake, another African-
American man who was convicted of mur-
der. After eight years behind bars, Blake was
set free when new evidence exonerated him
of the crime of which he had been unjustly
convicted. Acting Justice Robert S.

Kreindler of the New York State Supreme
Court apologized to the newly freed man for
the tragic failure of the criminal justice sys-
tem. A

Of course, if Blake had been speedily
executed after his conviction on charges of
double murder, he and his family would not
be getting this second chance. The story of
this man should be a wake—up call to advo-
cates of capital punishment.

One thing that has always disturbed me
is the support that so
many American
Christians have for
the death penalty,
despite the ever-pre-
sent risk of taking
innocent lives
through this practice.
It is true millions of
Christians actively
oppose the death penalty in this country, and
they should be commended for their
activism. Nevertheless, the loud-voiced
spokespeople of the Christian right continue
in their advocacy of capital punishment

Christian televangelist Jerry Falwell, in
his 1980 manifesto “Listen, America!” set
the example for today’s Christian right when
he declared, “The death penalty is a detenent
to crime.” He also cited the -ﬁrst chapter of

Pa11l’s letter to the Romans as proof “that O

God has given government the responsibili-
ty and authority to punish by death.”
Eighteen years later, leaders of the

 

Christian right spout Falwell’s party line. On
Nov. 5, for example, Christian Coalition
Executive Director Randy Tate appeared on
the ABC television program “Good
Morning America” to discuss the recent
elections; he boasted that one candidate
backed by the Coalition won a seat in
Congress because of his pro—death-penalty
position.

The support that white  like
Falwell and Tate have for the death penalty
is disturbing when
one considers that
this ﬁnal solution is
disproportionately
applied to African-
Americans; how
many of those exe-
cuted are, like Jeﬁiey
Blake, innocent
men? How many

more innocent Aﬁican-Americans is the»

Christian right willing to murder in order to
increase its own political power?

Of course, white supremacy and right-
wirrg Christianity have always gone hand in

. hand in America. The spiritual forefathers of

Falwell" and Tate are those  who
defended slavery in the 19th century; they
too were willing to sacriﬁce black lives on
the altar of political aspiration.

And this brings _me back to Mumia
Abu-Jamal. As I have noted, he is not just a
deathrowinrnate;heisalsoawriterof
rhetorical skill and moral vision. Pro-death-

penalty Christians should read Abu—Jamal’s
latest work, “Death Blossoms: Reﬂections
from a Prisoner of Conscience.” Written on
death row, “Death Blossoms” was published
in 1997 by Plough Publishing House of
Farmington, Pa.

In this book, Abu-Jamal calls upon
Christians to assume moral responsibility for
the crimes they and their forebears have
committed against humanity. Read Abu-
Jamal’s words:

“Until those who today call themselves
‘Christians’ acknowledge the carnage that
has been canied out in his [God’s] name, it is
hard to see how they cannot but continue to
commit deeds of devastation and evil. In his

name, they go on ﬁghting wars of avarice, \

campaigns of greed, legalized land-theft and
regulated robbery; they go on ﬁring their

‘ holy hatreds against the rest of the worl .”

He continues, “In the very shadow of
the cross, they continue to pillage and rape.
And in the name of one who, they claim,
came ‘to set captives free,’ they continue to
enslave.”

Will the  of America hear’

Abu—Jamal’s words? Will they continue to
be seduced by the false idol of capital pun-
ishment? W111 they stand by silenﬂy while
anoﬂrer human being is put to death?

I, for one, refuse to be silent.

graduate teaching fellow in Pitts English

  How freshmen get their groove back

Jason

Slesinger

Nothing makes me giggle more than a
good, humorous story. I can imagine myself
in 60 years, sitting around acarnpﬁre, telling
the following tale to my grandchildren. Their
eyes will light up, and their marshmallows
will burn because they’ll be paying strict
attention to every word. Of course, I won’t

_ tell them this story is based on a humorous

anecdote told to me by Pitt News Opinions
Editor James Maude. For all intents’ and pur-
poses, the tale you are about to hear is true.

“Stan,” a starry-eyed reporter wannabe
comes to Pitt with dreams of writing the
story that will propel him to an instant edi-
torship. He arrives with his parents at fresh-
men orientation, ready to start a new life and
leap into the great unknown, though he is
from Great Unknown, Pa. OK, so that joke
wasn’t too funny, but imagine it being told to
or even dirty —— old man;
then you’d be obliged to laugh.

“Beverly,” a young blond woman ﬁom
another Great Unknown, Pa., comes to Pitt
with dreams of doing something or other.
Beverly goes to freshmen orientation with
her parents, too. Together, they roam the
streets of Oakland, grimacing as they pass
the nefarious hang-outs of Pitt denizens and
miscreants. They smile, foolishly believing

Pitt upperclassmen will eagerly be Beverly’s
ﬁiends. Parental naivete is a wonderful
thing. i ‘ .
Like two Soviet blocs, the two families
meet. While Stan and Beverly get their Pitt
IDs ﬁom the ID Center, the parents bump
into each other and talk about their oﬁspring.

“Stan wants to be a joumalist,”‘says
Mrs. Sanders. “IfPitt onlyhadawritingpro-
gram that could teach someone beyond the
jack—a-knapes level, though.”

“Beverly wants to be a doctor,” says
Mrs. Simmons. “She’s a bright girl, and Pitt
has an amazingly good medical school. As
far as I’ve seen, there’s no way this place
could possibly persuade her to get a tongue
ring and a tattoo.”

The parents gloss over things to be.
(Awwww.) Reality has to set in, though.
Near them, waiting in line (albeit mistaken-
ly) at the ID Center are two of Pitt’s more
notorious students (you may have heard of
them, in fact): Adrian Kimble and Schlong.

“‘S’like, I’m invincible!” shouts
Schlong. “If you shoot me, I’ll f——in’ like
get back up and keep comin’.”

The parents look over, quite wonied by
the scnrffy Schlong and his Che Guevarra-
esque ﬁiencl .

“Yo, what’s up?” asks Schlong. “I’m
Schlong, and this is my hombre Adrian.”

“Oh, hi,” replies Mr. Sanders.

“Hey you guys, since you’re waiting
here, I’ve got a joke,” says Schlong. “‘S’like,
thisguywalksintoabar,andallthisstuﬁ°
like that, and he says to the bartender, ‘Dude,
I’m ﬁiggin’, like, sick of my beer. I want a
ﬁiggin’  that’ll rock my f——in’ world,
andallthisstulflikethat.’Thebartender
mixes up this drink, and ‘s’like, the dude
drinks it and is f—-ed up. He goes home,
and ‘s’like comes back the next day. The
bartender says, ‘Dude, you look like s-—t.’
The dude says, ‘Bartender, that drink f—-ed
me up, man. ‘S’like, I was blowing chunks,
and all this stulf like that.’ The bartender
says, ‘So? That happens to me all the time.’

The dude answers, ‘No man, Chunks is my I

97!

dog.

The Sanderses and the Sirnmonses are
not too impressed with the joke. Before they
have time to respond, Adrian says, “Schlong,
this is not the University Beverage Center.
This is. the ID Center. Whetting my appetite
with thoughts of revolution, not vodka,
made me makethis mistake.”

At this time, Beverly walks out of the
ID Center. Schlong’s eyes ﬁght up, but he’s
hastily dragged away by Adrian.

Sensing some semblance of order, the
Simmonses. introduce Beverly to the
Sanderses. Thoughts of hooking up Beverly
and Stan ﬁll their heads. The parents, collud-
ing with each other, try to get Stan and

Beverly to talk on points which they feel
they have a lot in common. Parents never
realize scoring is best done when the parents
are not around. .

Fast-forward past several lunch and din-
ner meetings over the orientation period. All
attempts to hook up Beverly and Stan fail.
Parents should not attempt to hook up their
kids; in a state in which parents were not
involved, maybe Stan and Beverly could’ve
been a cute couple. But alas, it was not
meant to be. ,

EPILOGUE: Stan became a relatively
well—known writer and photographer for the
Pitt News. Beverly got the tongue ring and
the tattoo and dated a Peter Pan ﬁgure who
couldn’t get his act together (because he
couldn’t face the Captain Hook shadow ﬁg-

ure). They do occasionally see each other, if-

you see two young kids sitting in a cafeteria,
across the table from each other, yet both in

a totally different time ﬁame, then you may -
well be witnessing the after-effects of par— .
ents trying to meddle with the love lives of ‘

their children.

Pin still has
hope, but not
for this year

The Pitt Panthers are not going to a
bowl game. This should not have come as

a surprise to either the Panther faithful or ,

almost anyone else who follows college
football.

But the impossibility of postseason
bowl play does not mean that the Panthers
should have given up on the season.

Saturday’s game was clearly not the

best effort put forth by the Pitt football ‘

squad. The Panthers not able to convert on
big plays, and they were not able to stop
Boston College’s offense consistently.

The tough—as-nails Pitt defense witl1—
ered in the heat  er, warmth  er, the cool
fall afternoon. . \

The team has played much better
most of the year, but Saturday, it showed it
is vulnerable to a good running attack. BC
amassed 178 rushing yards, 179 of which
were gained by Mike Cloud.

Wait, a discrepancy, you say. No, not
really. Cloud ran for 179, and Scott
Mutryn gained minus 1.

When BC was not running it, was
completing big passes.

Pitt’s offense was not much better;
actually, it was much worse. Lytle and his
legion did not score a point for 52:12 at
one point in the game.

The ﬁfth-year senior ﬁnished with
307 yards passing. True freshman
Brandon Wﬂliarns led the Panthers in
rushing with 65 yards. This may not
seem that bad for the Panthers, but their
offense was downright inept.

They could not move the ball, and
they could not make a big play. This made
it very diﬁ"1cult for Pitt to have a shot in
hell of winning the game.

As one sportswriter put it, “The best
moves by any Panther came from the
swing-dancing bandmembers.” ’_

As I was leaving the game, I was quite
frustrated with the state of Pitt football.
After seeing the excitement of the basket-
ball team, I had high hopes for the pigskin
boys. But, as they have most of the season,
they disappointed. '

Pitt has lost ﬁve games in a row to
earn a stellar record of 2-7.

After last year’s bowl bid, people
thought this program had already turned
around, but it looks like it will take a little
more time.

Although I was down on the program
after the game, head coach Walt Harris
restored my faith at the postgarne press
conference.

He explained that he tried to down-

The Cosby show gets rave reviews vs. UMBC

Patrick Robertson

Sports Edltor

Kellii Taylor and Attila
Cosby decided to have a Friday
night party at Fitzgerald Field
House.

They were kind enough to
invite their teammates, the
University of Maryland-
Baltimore County basketball team
and 5,137 Pitt Panther fans to join
them.

The Panthers, behind strong
performances from Cosby and
Taylor, beat the Retrievers, 84-56.
to start the season at 1-0.

“They physically dominated
us, and it started at the guard play,”
visiting coach Tom Sullivan said.

Taylor ﬁnished the game with
a career-high 21 points to go along
with Cosby’s 19 points, 12

rebounds and school-record-tying '

seven blocks.

Pitt came out a little lethargic
inthe ﬁrst half, going down 16-11
atone point. UMBC was pacedin
the early going by four points
from both Isaac Green and
Kennedy Okafor, who led the
Retrieversf 8-0 ﬁrst-half rtm.

The rest of the first half

belonged to the Panthers, who 

came back on a Cosby layup and
a Taylor three-pointer.

Pitt widened its lead to 41-34 -

at the break Taylor led the scor-
ing parade at halftime with 11,
followed by Isaac Hawkins with
nine and Cosby with eight.

The Panthers — who are still

'without Vonteego Cummings,

Stephen Flores and freshman
Chris Seabrooks due to injuries
— made up for those players’
absence with a big second-half
run.
UMBC came out strong at
the beginning of the half, cutting
the Pitt lead to 46-43 at the 16:46
mark on a three—pointer by

Terence Ward.
Pitt then exploded for a 26-6

rim over the next eight minutes. 1

During the run, Hawkins had

eight points, while Cosby added

four points and four blocks.
Taylor would not be left, out,
notching 10 points and three
steals.

Kevin Lilley

Senior Football Writer

Matt Lytle and Juan Williams combined
to capture the essence of Saturday’s Pitt-
Boston College game on the Panthers’ ﬁrst

—play from scrimmage.

On ﬁrst down, on Pitt’s ﬁrst oﬁensive
play of the game, from the Pit 22-yard line,

Lytle took a deep drop and ﬁred a rocket to

Wrlliarns, who had slipped behind BC’s line-
backing corps. The tight end grabbed the
pass for a 22-yard pickup.

. And then, he fumbled it.

Adam Newman recovered the loose
ball for the Eagles, who then drove 44 yards
in 1:01 for the game’s ﬁrst touchdown. The
Eagles (46, 3-3 in the Big East) went on to
defeat the Panthers (2-7, 0-5), 23-15.

“We just have too many mistakes,”
Lyﬂe said “Mistakes hurt you. 'I'hat’s been
the outcome of the last however many
games we’ ve had”

The loss was Pitt’s ﬁfth in a row and its
third straight defeat at Pitt Stadium.

While the Panther streak continued,
BC’s six—garne skid came to an end, thanks
to the Pitt turnovers and the rushing of Mike
Cloud, who broke both the Boston College

and the Big East single-season rushing
records in Saturday’s contest

Cloud ﬁnished with 179 yards on 37
carries, bringing his season total to 1,547
yards. Chuckie Dukes’ BC-record 1,387

The Eagle senior ran for only 6 yards on
BC’s ﬁrst touchdown drive, letting quarter-
back Scott Mutryn and the Panther defense
do most of the work Mutryn scrambled for
6 yards on a third—down play to prolong the
drive, and Pitt comerback Hank Poteat drew
a pass-interference penalty on the following
play to move the Eagles to the Pitt 17.

Mutryn hit Anthony DiCosmo for a 17-
yard score to ﬁnish the drive, as the receiver
ﬂew past Tray Crayton and made an over-
the-sho11lder catch in the corner of the end
zone.

Lytle answered with a 79-yard scoring
drive, ﬁnishing the seven-play march with a
20-yard quarterback keeper. He ﬁnished the
contest with only 15 yards rushing, however,
thankstothreeEagle sacks andafumble.

“I have a lot of respect for the work ethic
that he’s employ ” Harris said of his start-
ing quarterback, who ﬁnished the game with
307 yards passing.

The score remained knotted until the
8:11 mark of the second, when Pitt long
snapper John Parker larmched a snap over
the head of punter Greg DeBolt. DeBolt bat-

Asslstant Sports Editor

Early in the second ‘quarter of

this season.

In fact, only four defensive starters
— Marlin Young, Kenny Pegram, Phil
Clarke and Tray Crayton — will gradu-
ate this year. And it’s in the defensive
backﬁeld where Pitt appears to have the

' most depth. :

leaping grab to pick off a Scott Mutryn
pass. T _ T I
 Pitt was still in the game at that

But there are a couple other reasons ~

been among the nation’s top 20 most of '

First is that it would end up being
one of the only Pitt highlights all after-
noon as the Panthers ended up dropping
the contest to the Boston College
Eagles, 23-15, to remain winless in the
Big East.

Second, it was Poteat’s sixth inter-
ception of the year. Not only does that
place him atop the Panthers’ roster in
interceptions, but it also ties him for
first place in the country.

. The Panthers’ season has fallen
apart, and the attention of most fans has
shifted to the always elusive “next
year.”

The solid play of Poteat and the
Panther defense in this otherwise dis-

mal season is a valid reason for _some .

optimism.

I Poteat, a former running back, has
played impressively all season in the
Panthers’ defensive backﬁeld.

But as strong as he’s looked in the _

‘ secondary, he’s looked even better on
I the kick- and punt-retum units. He con-

tinued the trend yesterday, bringing

2 turnovers. If

Current Panther starting safeties
Seth Homack, who leads the team with
26 tackles, and D.J. Dinkins, who is
arguably the best athlete on the team,
will join Poteat in the Panther sec-
ondary again next year.

Chiffon Allen has looked impres-
sive when he has played, and he will
probably step in at the other comer in
1999’. '

The linebacking corps will lose
Clarke, but the rest of the group —
including Amir Purifoy, Karim
Thompson, Nick Cole, Cody Miller and
Bryan Knight — is young and impres-
sive. ’ - '

The defensive line will return
Demond Gibson, Julian Graham, Ken
Kashubara, Trey McCray and Brandon
Dewey. and should still be strong.‘

But that’s next year.

Thisyear, the Panthers find a way
to lose" every week. If it’s not sacks, it’s

fast break.

sprinted down the ﬂoor. Just as the defender
came up beside him, Taylor shocked every-
one in attendance by skying his six—foot,
one-inch frame, along with his injured foot,
through the air for a dunk that sent the Field
House Fanatics into a frenzy.

“My foot feels ﬁne. It feels great to just
play,” Taylor said.

He missed almost all of last season due
to an injury that prompted doctors to insert
a metal pin ir1 his foot.

Cosby helped Taylor put the game out
of reach by cleanly blocking three shots on
two Retriever possessions. He came from
the weak side on all three to swat the shots
out of the air.

“'Ihey [Pitt] dominated with their ath-
leticism,” Sullivan said of the run and the
game.

These three blocks led Cosby to a
school-record seven blocks on the night.

Cosby said, “It is nice to be up with all
of the others in the record book”

Cosby, who played 39 minutes a game
asafreshmanlastseason,hasmatureda
great deal since last year.

.“I feel like I am out of the freshman
burden,” he said '

His coach still believes Cosby has a
long way to go before he is a force on this
team.
“The biggestrleap he has to make this
year is mentally,” Willard said.

Cosby and his Panther teammates will
face the Red Flash of St. Francis (Pa)
Tuesday at Fitzgerald Field House at 7:30
pm. '

He also added that he is playing play-

This, according to Harris, means they have
not had to go through the tough times to
understand howthe world works.

No coach will ever be able to take a‘
ﬂoundering program like Pitt and turn it
around in a year or two.- 0

Harris was lucky that he had an

last year. After that senior class left, there
was not much of the team that could step
up and take charge. That is evident.

safety, preventing BC from recovering for a
touchdown but giving the Eagles a 9-7 lead.

The Eagles returned the ensuing free
kick to the Pitt 48-yard line, and six plays
later, Mutryn victimized‘ another Panther
defender.

The quarterback ﬁred a 30-yard scoring
strike to Dedrick Dewalt, who slid by Chuck
Brown to make the reception. BC held its
16-7 advantage until late in the third, when
the Eagles drove 35 yardsfor their third
score. -

Cloud ran for 28 of those yards, includ-
ing the drive—capping 9-yard touchdown nm.

.“He just kept cutting it back,” said Pitt
linebacker Nick Cole, describing Cloud’s
rushing style. “At the point of attack, we
were all right He just cut back a lot.’’

Pitt could not close the gap on its next
two possessions. The ﬁrst ended with a

DeBolt punt, and the second —— an eight-
play drive that ended on the BC 20-yard line
— brought the crowd back into the contest 
but not for a healthy reason.

On second-and-1 from the 20, Lytle
threwaslant-inpattemtoLatefGrimthathit
the receiver square in the chest.

Just as the ball did so, however, BC
defender Pedro Cirino hit Grim square in the
face, slanting in from the opposite direction
and janing the ball and Grim’s conscious-
ness out of the receiver’s hands.

“That was a hell of a collision,” Harris
said. After the contest, Grim passed the
coach’s physical — Hanis asked the receiv-
er what his name was, and he answered,
“Latef.”

“So he’s O ” Harris said. .

Grim recovered and jogged off the ﬁeld,
but the Panthers could not advance any far-
ther. Pitt did score on a 99-yard drive in the
garne’s closing minutes but lost an onside
kick to the Eagles to ﬁnish the contest.
