All-student elections Wednesday showed a heavier turn- v—
out of voters than has been seen at Pitt for several years.-
The reason for the surprising interest in the voting was
attributed to the return of s1ates—-namely the two factions

of the disrupted Interfraternity Council which assumed the

names "of Pitt and Panther.

Much of the voting following the

Competition for the now com-

A capsule rundown:  _

Panther Nine Invades
Ohio U. for Two Games

By STEVE BUTCHOCK .

The Pitt baseball team is on the road again for a. pair
of games today and tomorrow against’ Ohio University in
Athens. It will be’ the second successive weekend that the
Mittmen have ventured on to foreign soil.

Off their showing against Quantico, the Panthers will

undoubtedly be favored, but C,oach° . .
aces, on the mound, with Jim Mil-

Sarge Mitterling won’t admit it.
His only comment is, “They’ll be
tough; they always have a good
team.” ' ’

The nice weather the past few

days has enable the Mittmen to-

practice on the
Schenley Oval
Diamond. This
should sharpen
up the ﬁelding‘
of the team,
thus giving the
pitchers the in-
_ﬁeld'support
that was lack-
ing in_ the ﬁrst
two games,__
“The t e a m
has some bright
spots,” Sarge points out, “but it
' also has a few shaggy spots.” The
‘biggest problem facing the coach
now is the right ﬁeld spot. He
plans on using Tom Bigley in the
outer garden until Tony Simile or
. one of the other boys begins to

"Emery 

' hit with authority. Bxigley is ex-

pected to share catching with
Milt Emery, the power-hitting
veteran.

The addition of Bigley gives
Pitt a “murderers row” of power-
boys in Dick Dietrick, Emery, and
Bob Kyle. -’

Mitterling plans to start Doc
Shanafelt and Don Miller, his two

Pitt-WUU Series p

'  Home-and-Home

' Athletic Departments at West
Virginia and Pitt have announced
the arrangement of‘ a home-and-V
home football series, beginning
when the two schools open their
seasons Sept. 22, 1956‘ at Morgan-
town. '

Unofﬁcially, however, the ser-
ies could be dated from this fall's
contest at Mountaineer Field.
