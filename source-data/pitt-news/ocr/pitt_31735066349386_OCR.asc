New Vote Unnecessary,  

Gronsky Appeal Claims

BY BILL MOORE

Claiming there ‘was not’ enough
evidence presented to warrant a
new election, former, Student‘
Government Board (SGB) Presi-
dent"-elect Joe Gronsky has appeal-
ed a ruling made Tuesday by the
Student Government Elections

"~."’Committee (SGEC) to invalidate

last week’s voting.

The l SGEC,- reacting to, an
official complaint by presidential
candidate Barry Weisband. ruled a
new election would be held
Tuesday, and invalidated ‘the
election Gronsky won by 32 votes.

Yesterday, Gronsky filed an
appeal that will put the question in
the lap of the Student Government
Judicial Board (SGJB)-and possibly
postpone the second election.

"1 don’t think the evidence
_presented was good enough to go
all the way to-a new election,”
Gronsky said.

Weisband, who pulled 609 votes
to Weisband’s. 641 in the first
election, claimed that election was
invalid because of irregularities
with the voting machines. Slips of
paper used to correct the spelling
of another candidate’s name moved
in the machine to cover his name,
Weisband claimed.

“Anyone has the right to appeal
any decision by the Elections

Committee,“ he said after learning
of Gronsky’s appeal. “I just hope
the matter is cleared up as soon as
possible so the Student Govern-

Black feminist protests

“Aunt .|emima",Portraya| Hit  

; BY GEORGENE KALEINA

Black women have been portray-
ed through history on twd negative
sides as “docile, unattractive Aunt
Jemimas and sexless, matriarchal
women,” feminist Willie Mae Reid
said during well-attended Wo-
men’s Cultural Festival lecture in
the Student Union Ballroom last
night.

Reid, Socialist Workers’ Party
vice-presidential candidate,
from slavery to the present, black
women have been the most abused

K of the oppressed.

“In slavery, we were raped,
abused and robbed of our
households,” she said. “Even now
we are the lowest-paidpeven for
men-ial jobs in the labor market.

.“The liberation movement
should not be seen by, us -as a

mechanism to get closer to white ”

women, but just the opposite,”
Reid said. “It’s the issues raised by

“Wooden Keg Addition to Open

BY BRUCE WALDHOLTZ

The Wooden Keg's,restaurant
addition will open for lunches on
Monday, but won't serve alcoholic
beverages until later in the week,
according to owner Barney Silver-
man. _

The addition, a restaurant called
“C.J. Barney's,” is awaiting
approval of a liquor license
extension from the state ‘Liquor
Control Board (LCB) in Harrisburg.

,$:~~The restaurant’s opening has
" been delayed more than a month

because of a petition ﬁled with the
LCB by Oakland Development
Incorporated (ODI), a coalition of
14 community groups and four
institutional members—Pitt, the
Health Center, Carlow College and
the Chamber of Commerce.

The petition was drawn up at an
ODI meeting in November; when
the group learned of the expansion
in a Public Safety Committee report
from Jay Roling, Pitt's ODI
representative.

The vote on the petition, which
requested that the LCB hold public
hearings on the proposed expan-

, ’Barney1’s will open,

 

finally, afterpa confusing protest. M

6 -I . ,

sion, yielded six votes of approval
and four abstentions. The four
institutional groups were the
abstentions. '
Roling said he learned of the
expansion in a letter from the LCB
asking if Pitt had any objections to
the requested license extension.
The LCB is required bv law to send
such a letter to any educational

institution if the extension would

come within 200 feet of the school.

Roling informed the LCB that
“while Pitt cannot come out in
favor of opening more bars in the
area, it cannot oppose a business-

man's right to expand.”

ODI, however, complained the
extension would bring in “undesir-
able", people, further contributing
to the problems near the corner of
Forbes Avenue and South Bouquet

Street, adjacent to the Keg, and
termed a “trouble spot” by OD_I’s

Public Safety Committee.
A Jan.

  

15 meeting between
Roling's Public Safety Committee
and the Keg owners ended in an
inspection of ,the restaurant. the
committee agreed that it had been
incorrect in its impressions and

§iF!8¢r_ photo ‘

    
  
 

establishment. The committee de-
cided to withdraw its objections to
the license. Silverman and mem-
bers of Roling’s committee agreed
“there had been a serious lack of
communication over the matter.”
The LCB hearing requested by
the petition was held Tuesday,
when ODI withdrew its complaints.
The hearing results were forward-

‘ ed to Harrisburg and will be acted

on next Tuesday. The license
request, however, may not reach
Pittsburgh until late Tuesday
night, or even later in the week.
The restaurant will serve alcoholic
beverages the day the license is
received, Silverman said.

School Strike
May Cause
Entrance Mess

BY LISA RUBYENSTEIN

Pittsburgh high-school seniors
- applying for admission to Pitt in the
fall may face difficulties as a result
_of the ‘recent Pittsburgh teachers’
strike, according to Dean of
Admissions Kenneth Wenger.

Students whose acceptance to
Pitt depends on the results of their
mid-year grades may have prob-
lems, Wenger said.

“We don’t know what the
schools are going to do about the
mid-year grades, and until the
Board of Education makes a
_decision about the calendar, we
won't know whether we'll be able
to use mid-year. grades in ‘our
decision," Wenger explained.

Wenger said 30% of the
applications are held until such
grades are received.

Depending on the Board of
Education's . decision . about. the
calendar, the Admissions’ Office

A request by the Greek Week
Concert Committee to use money
allocated for an on-campus concert

to subsidize student ticket pur- .

chases for an off-campus concert

was turned down last night by the

Student Government Board (SGB).
Greek representative, unhappy

. with plans for a concert featuring

Maria Muldaur at the Syria
Mosque, asked that they be
allowed to use a portion of the
$12,000 allocated to them to allow
students to attend a concert
scheduled at the Stanley Theater,
downtown, featuring the Marshall
Tucker Band. . 2 4

The SGB voted 3-2 not to
approve the Greeks’ request.»

, Student Government Allocations
Committee member Patty Cooper
argued against approving the
request. “It would be a dangerous
precedent to setat this time,” she
said.

While the _Muldaur
would be handled by the SGB
Programming Committee, as Greek
Week concerts have been in the
past,lthe Marshall Tucker Band
appearance is sponsored by Di-

Cesare-Engler Productions, Cooper

explained.

“This undercuts the whole
purpose of the Programming
Committee’s existence,” she said.

Greek Week representative Gary
Evans disagreed with Cooper's
arguments, claiming no precedent
would be set. “There is no time,"
he said. “We can't be fooling
around much longer. .

“This is just something we have
to set up for the situation we are in
now, not any sort of a precedent."

.Ev-ans also objected to. the
Allocations -Committee ‘suggestion
to move the Greek, Week-Engi-

'neers’ Week co_n'cert_to a later date. ’

Though Cooper argued it was

during Greek Week, Evans claimed
holding the Concert during either-

' The Greeks had planned to
charter buses to and from the
Tucker concert. .
Evans said they hadreached ‘an
agreement with .the DiCesare-
Engler Productions to purchase a
large number of the seats. The total
amount needed for the concert and

buses would be $7,000, according V

to Evans.

Asked to comment on the appeal,

SGEC chairman Lee Moses said

only, “I sort of expected it.”
Now the SGJB must decide to
uphold or to overtum the SGEC

‘decision; but it ﬁrst must decide

the proper procedure for hearing

both sides of the case.
Coordinator'of Campus Judicial

Systems Alden Bowen said he will

ask Gronsky to expand his formal

appeal rationale.‘ “I would like to
see his_objections set down with
greater specificity," he said. _
The SGJB will decide Friday
when it will hear the case, and

pp p Gronsky Appeal Claims

hopefully reach a decision before
Tuesday, when the second presi-
dential elections are scheduled.

The SGJ B code does not provide
for an adversary proceeding, for
which the Gronsky appeal will call.
That, too, will have to be worked
out, Bowen explained.

If the Judicial Board approves

the SGEC_ ruling, and if time‘

permits, tl‘l’é"it'e\v election_will be
on Tuesday with only the four
original presidential candidates-
Gronsky, Weisband, Larry_ Chaban
and Mark Satinoff—eligible.

Inauguration of the SGB mem-
bers and the eventual presidential
victor may be held a week later
than originally scheduled.‘

Representatives from SGB, the

discussed the current proceedings

‘of the ad hoc Committee on Ticket

Distribution, which has been
working on a proposal for revamp-

system. -
Commuter Association President

Larry Chaban, strongly supporting
a no-pay system for student tickets,
presented the student leaders with
his distribution proposal.

I-Ie argued for a free distribution
of tickets to full-time students who
request them by June 1. This
theoretically would allow the

public.

Admissions Problem

_ “If the school district holds the
regular nine-week session, we may

“not, receive‘ the mid-year grades

until March," Wenger said. “I
don't like to only use the first nine

. weeks’ grades, but I don't like to

penalize the students.."
A Board of Education explained
"the new school calendar was being

-prepared and would be made.

Schenley High School guidance
counselor William Bochicchio said
he doubted the strike would have
any effect on students’ acceptances
into college. ,

“Most students were informed
that their transcripts would be
available to them during the strike.
Therevwas always a clerk available
to aid with transcripts," Bochicchio
said.

white women that blacks must rally
for.” '

Reid 'said the passage of the
Equal Rights Amendments (ERA)
would provide an extra tool for the
“fight." “The law will be behind
us for the first time, and we must
demand the legalization of equality
followed by the demand to
implement the equality,” she said.

, “If we want change, we have to
fightrfor that change and when we

ﬁght, we want to win,” Reid said. -

“So, we need numbers and have to
unite with all whites and’ blacks to
win." ’
Black women have been “deter-
mined, bold and aggressive war-

riors,” according to Reid. She said
she considers Harriet Tubman,

Provisions for freshman students
and date-tickets also were made in
Chaban’s proposal.

No. formal vote was taken on
Chaban’s system, but the large
majority of those present said they
still wanted ’a no-pay system.

The Board approved an amend-
ment to the SGB bylaws allowing
for a one-week postponement of the

I inauguration of the newly elected

SGB members, pending settlement
of an appeal by victor Joe Gronsky
of a decision to rerun the election.

“All women alive are part of the
women’s liberation movement,
even the oneswho hate it,”’author
and feministlKate Millett said to a
standing-room-only crowd in the
Student Union Ballroom Wednes-

A day.

“Ultimately, it’s the ones deeply
involved in the workthat put their
hearts, blood and love into it, but
it’s for all women.” Millett said in
the kickoff speech of the Women’s
Cultural Festival sponsored» by the

_ Undergraduate Women’s Union.

She said women always have

. been a “subject people” and are,

', the last oppressed to become free.

Millett said. “It's our job to bring

who organized the Underground
Railroad for slaves, one of the best
fighters of the movement.

“My concern is that I want the
nation to know I have rights and I
expect them to be respected," Reid
said. “There are laws protecting
those rights on the books that I
expect to be followed.”

She deﬁned real victory as “total
and complete change of society.”
“I want a brand new society which
will come about
action-—pressure for ‘ change is
needed to do that,” she said.

“It .is going to be mass action
which will assure that those black
school children in , Boston have
equal access, that will legalize the
equality of ERA and that will

change in the future, and yet‘ we
must sift out our past.”

‘ Millett spoke on the first
movement of women, which
involved the abolition of slavery.
“ln abolition, we first won the right
to speak, because before that we
couldn’t even speak except at
Quaker meetings. \ .

“After this, a philosophy devel-
oped among women -to stick
together,” Millett said. “For two

Reid also saw the “ruling rich”
as manipulating the divisions
between blacks and whites, and
men and women. “It’s all part of
the game by the ruling rich to keep
the classes confused even though
we are the majority,” shesaid.

Reid called her plattorm tor the

would “deal concretely and per-
manently with problems facing
people economically, politically as
well as socially."

minute these women showed up in
public, they were thrown into
prison.”

“We were responsible for
bringing the idea of America to the
light,” Millett said. “It was a good
idea and still is, but it was poisoned
from the start with. slavery, and
still is with racism and prejudice.”

She said it was the “mission,
responsibility and honor of women
to bring about the education of the
oppressed. _

“We are bringing about our own

said.

Phyllis Chesler, psychologist and
author of Women and Madness,
also spoke.

Chesler said women’s fight for
the right to education was very
hard, so they should not abuse it.
“I learned this on my own with
women and from women.

“Most women never move.

toward what is better because we
fear the worst, such as rape and
prostitution,” Chesler said. “The
long road to our freedom, I’m
afraid, is going to be well-paved
with good intentions, but will be

“I didn't move onto power or to

She cited her successful lawsuit
against the‘ Hearst Publishing
Corporation for errors in the
paperback version of her book
Women and Madness. “I found it
was expensive," and when you go
into suing such a big corporation,
you go into the battle alone," she
said. “You also know that your

  Second Time Around

The ruling handed down by the Student Government Elections
Committee (SGEC) calling for a new election of the Student
Govemment Board president was by no means an easy decision, but
one that is justiﬁed nontheless.

The petition filed by presidential candidate Barry Weisband, who
claimed his name was obscured on two voting machines in the Student

a new election, especially since Joe Gronsky, the leading vote-getter,
surpassed Weisband by only 32 votes.

With such a slim margin, .even the slightest malftmction in the voting
process could have prejudiced the results.

A hard-fought campaign with major conﬂicting power blocs and a vote
that goes down to the wire—twice—-will make this a virtual certainty.

While this is amusing for those who view politics as sport, it can
become hell for those who must work within Student Government as if
it were more than just a game.

With neat justiﬁcation, we can say surely that a new election is ‘

needed, but it’s with a wringing of hands that we welcome it now at a

time when student participation is at its lowest ebb.

A Refreshing Attitude

Students who deal daily with administrators know that all Pitt

that the administrator stereotyped is not all that farfetched, students

Take, for instance, Housing Director Don Hughes; _

While some" admil1i'strators choose to run their ofﬁces like armed
camps, Hughes has been receptive to student concerns.

main and board hikes for the coming year. When he was asked for the

A dubious homestretch

Ah, But to Be President

BY BILL MOORE

Ted White, in his book,Breach of
Faith, and Ted Windt, in his Pitt
course “Presidential Rhetoric”
make one point about Richard
Nixon. Despite his obvious short-
comings, they say, Nixon had
enough concern, for the nation not
to contest the 1960 election when
he was narrowly defeated by John
F. Kennedy.

Two swing-statesl—’lllinois and
Texas—had obvious irregularities
in the vote tallying, and Nixon had

a good reason to ask for a recount.
Instead, realizing the tediousness

' of the process and the need for a
smooth transition of power, he
accepted defeat and went off to
California.

Barry Weisband,, narrowly de-
feated by Joe Gronsky in a Student
Government Board (SGB) presi-
dential election with obvious
irregularities, decided differently.

Now Gronsky must run again.

There are differences, obviously,
between the two elections. For one
thing, rerunning an SGB election
is markedly less difﬁcult than‘
rerunning a national election. Also,

Letter

and ‘this becomes clearer every
day, leaving the SGB leaderless for
a few days won't throw the student
body into panic.

Still, whoever wins next week in
Round Two of the presidential
election will have to serve his term
with a questionable mandate. And
it would be unfair to ignore the
disappointment Gronsky must feel.
He was pleased to win and wasted
no time preparing to assume his
duties next week. '

Tlle obvious villain in this tale of
woe would be Weisband. But,
again, it would be unfair to ignore
the disappointment he felt when
ﬁnding out he lost an election by a
mere 32 votes.

To find how
elections were run, and that some
students may not have been able to

ﬁnd his name on the voting-

machines, certainly didn’t cheer
him up.

Gronsky and Weisband ran
vigorous campaigns. Both wanted
the office very‘ much. Both _ are
qualiﬁed. And both pulled a good
portion of the total vote. ‘

shoddily the

To ask Gronsky to shrug his
shoulders and say, “Fine, l’ll just

much. To ask Weisband to shrug
his and say,.“Fine, I'll ignore the

too much, too. ‘ -

The villain, in fact, is neither
Gronsky nor Weisband. The villian
is an inept, unorganized, over-bur-
eaucratized Student Government
Elections Committee (SGEC) that
misspells names, corrects, them
haphazardly, forgets to correct
some. notices the paper used for
the corrections falling off the
machines and then neglects to do
anything about it, and then runs a
mockery of a hearing at which the
only people with any relevant‘
testimony were the SGEC members‘
themselves. ART:

The list of SGEC “oversights"

can go on and on, but the point is
obvious.

‘In future SGECS feel a compul-
sion to,mimic the complexity of
‘‘real'’ elections, the least they can
do is do. it right. If they can’t, bring
back the paper ballots.

Opportunities with a Union

Professor Arnett’s moderate and
reasoned letter of Jan. 26 kicks of

” the organizational campaign for

faculty collective bargaining on a
high note. Two questions are
raised: Is this the time for
collective bargaining and is collec-
tive bargaining necessary? I would
like to respond to both questions

that choice entails at the present.
Personally, I fear that if collective
bargaining is not elected now, the
opportunity may be gone and
untold damage done in the process.
I_ do not choose to‘ base my
argument on fear for the future,
however, since the present evi-

funds estimated to be greater than
$1 million for renovations.
Furthermore, the administration
has promised to make more space
available through further disloca-
tions and renovations at the
expense of millions of dollars.
Most importantly, the adminis-
tration imposed its choice of leader

Following this display to the
faculty. the new chairman presen-
ted himself for questioning at a
meeting of graduate students. One
of the graduate students asked,
“Will the new department continue
with the former practice of having
graduate students attend staff
conferences?" The chairman
responded that he might invite
them when something relevant to
their interests was to be discussed.
The questioner went on to state
that graduate students shared the

expect to escape if the administra-

is successful.

will hopefully continue to be
colleagues no matter which point of
view prevails or which union wins.

Timing is, indeed, a chief
concern. For three years members
of the present Pitt Professional
Union (PPU) have urged that the
time has come for collective
bargaining. A year and a half ago
more than 30% of the so-called

Provost area faculty agreed with ‘

the PPU—position and signed cards
calling for the right of collective
bargaining.

Now, the crucial question is,
does a majority of the faculty in the
provost area agree. This is not so
much a-matter of which bargaining
agent should represent us, but
whether any bargaining agent is
desirable at this time. Of course,
those of us in the PPU argue that
the American Federation of Teach-
ers (AFT) with which we are
affiliated bargains best and has
for
education and teachers wherever it
has contracts. But, many of us in
the PPU recognize that if collective
bargaining is at issue, as it may be
in a runoff between some other
bargaining agent and the no-agent
option, we will happily vote for the
competing agent rather than see
collective bargaining defeated.

Professor Arnett’s letter does not
claim that collective bargaining
may not be appropriate at some
later time, but merely that this is
not the time. The future, however,
is imponderable. No one's crystal
ball is, after all, any better than
anyone else’s. What we have for
certain is only the present, and the
real issue is whether an opportun-
ity that is real and exists today
should be thrown away. The fact is
that we have a choice now, and we

The issue of whether to have
collective bargaining or not rests
exactly where Professor Arnett
says it rests, on the question, is the
faculty in an adversary relationship
with the administration‘? Recent
events in the merging of the former
biology, microbiology and biophy-
sics, and biochemistry departments
into the collective life sciences
department clearly show that the
faculty is most certainly in an
adversary relationship with the
administration.

First, this .merger was roundly
opposed by the vast majority of the
faculties in these departments,
mainly, it seems, on the grounds
that the three departments had
different teaching missions which

’ the merger would‘ obscure to the

disservice of students. The
administration, nevertheless, im-
posed the merger on us.

Second, present space and
facilities did not permit the merger
without the expense of vast sums of
money and the "dislocation of
existing teaching laboratories in
favor of research laboratories. The
administration, nevertheless, im-
posed the merger and allocated

administration's candidate lost an
informal vote that we conducted.
Here is the nub of the issue——the
administration has created the
adversary relationship where none
might have existed before. The
administration has imposed a
“foreman" on us, not a depart-
ment chairman as the title would
have you believe. The PLRB has
recognized this relationship be-
tween chairman and foreman and
has excluded the so-called chair-
man from the bargaining units in
the Provost's area. As faculty, we
too must acknowledge that the
adversary relationship is real and is
here and now.

Our new chairman has had his
first faculty meeting. He began by
saying that he did not have time or
inclination to see faculty members
in conferences, and advised us that
any necessary communication with
him could be conducted by mail.
He thought that parliamentary
procedure might be in order for
conducting faculty meetings, but
then set this thought aside. He
-announced that he intended to be
unavailable to faculty who have
complaints or problems and that he

A Reader Reviews

I found Doug Gebhard’s review
of Morning Song’s performance to
be very disappointing. I find it
hard to understand what their.
being from State College has to do’
with anything. Having seen and
spoken with them several times, I
have‘found them to be sensitive
and extremely talented musicians.

I have everyfaith that Morning
Song will make it. It might take a

while, but talent like this cannot be
ignored. For the many of us that
share my sentiments, we can help
Morning Song succeed by coaxing
the radio stations to give their
album as much airplay as possible.
All of us that truly love music and
new talent will be rewarded in our
efforts.

  Five Easy Ways to Despair  

BY JOHN METCALFE

A few Sundays ago, a columnist for our only

Sunday newspaper explained just why the world was
going to hell so much faster now than it had been
when he was a lad. He knew the cause; the
universities were teaching despair. They were

~ teaching the young (or those of them who could pass
the College Boards) that nothing—-including our "

leaders and betters—could be trusted, and that
students might as well give up and wear funny
clothes and grow hair all over their bodies. He was
mistaken.
-Universities teach no such thing. Not even Pitt.
_ They only furnish examples and methods.

With any luck, the student who comes to Pitt»\wiil'5";

learn to examine and evaluate events in the world
around him;'it is also likely that such a student will
take a greater interest in current affairs and_ news
than might‘ otherwise have been the case.
Put simply, the college student is likely to know
. what is going on in the world and to have some idea
what all of this means. '

Let me return to our mythical student. If he knows

how to read and has been here for a couple of years,

» he will have noticed the following developments:
1. A state Senator, now known as Mr. Frank
' Mazzei (I have looked it up--if a senator is removed
. other -than by, retirement or defeat, it is.no longer
necessary to address him as “The Honorable”), was
removed from office following his conviction on
charges of extortion. He had never denied that he
received? the money in question—a_ mere $20,000-

 ‘but’ claimed that it was a valid political contribution.

.  He described the whole transaction as “business as

usual,” and dismissed certain discrepancies in his
«story of how and when he had gotten the funds as
irrelevant. "He is now a guest at a comfortable though

. remote camp in central Pennsylvania. _’
2. The Governor of Pennsylvania, the Honorable

the State Police has been recommended for
’ prosecution in connection withcertain irregularities
in the prosecution of State policemen charged with
traffic offenses committed while under the inﬂuence

\ _of alcohol. The Governor has chosen to retain or ﬁre

_the chief on the basis of lie-detector tests. Such tests
are not acceptable as evidence in court. If he should
fire the chief, the chief would be effectively immune

, from prosecution. If the chief remains in office, there

would be a strong presumption that he must have
passed thetest. In either case, the prosecution
originally ‘recommended would be severely tainted.

» . The Honorable Shapp would like to be President.

I ‘ ‘Milton Shapp, is faced with a dilemma. His chief of

3. About two years ago, the Honorable Peter
Flaherty, the Mayor of Pittsburgh, attempted to stop
the construction of the new Law Building. He found
that the University was encroaching upon a peculiar
sort of City property known as “paper streets.”
These were streets which appeared nowhere in the
world except on certain city maps. They were streets
which had never been built, would never have gone
anywhere, and could never have been of much use to
the average resident of the city. , After some

expensive delay, the matter was settled, to the relief

of all and the satisfaction of the Mayor.

4. One of the largest corporations in Pittsburgh,
indeed, one of the largest corporations in the world,
Gulf Oil, came under investigation for illegal political
contributions in this country and abroad. The
corporation refused comment for a long time, before
pleading “nolcontest” and sacriﬁcing a medium-low
level executive. Alas, after the tines were paid, the
medium-low executive was summoned to further
hearings and investigations, and he spilled the
beans. Interest -mounted asimillions upon millions of
dollars which had been reported to neither the
taxman nor the stockholders were found to, have been
passed out. At last the chairman of the board was
asked‘ about all this. He said he knew nothing. It was
encouraging to see that the internal investigation
came up with a defense against the standard defense
(in this Watergate era) of “overzealous underlings.”
The in-shop investigators chose to accept ignorance,

not as an excuse, but as evidence-of incompetence.

Bob R. Dorsey, the Chairman of the Board of the
corporation, was tagged with the full responsibility

‘ forthe action of his underlings, however zealous.

Mr. Dorsey denied responsibility. He swore he
would neither resign nor be forced into resignation.
At the end of a board meeting which ran late into the
night and well into the morning, he resigned.
These, of course, are only localexamples of the
sort of information a Pitt student might be presented
with, and might feel an obligation to interpret. He
might come to believe that those who are often called
his betters are actually only_his superiors; that they
enjoy only the advantage of position over him. He
might even admire himself;
tempted by power, he had never been corrupted by
it. .
At’ the very least, he would accept the morality of
his leaders for what it is. They conduct “business as
usual," and they are not noticably worse than those
they rule. Or he might wonder why these four stories
struck him so forcefully. .
In each case, the principal character is, or was, a
Trustee of the University of Pittsburgh.

ISRAEL WEEK ACTIVITIES

Next week will be Israel week on
_campus. It will run from Tuesday
until Saturday and will consist of

‘tion booths, homemade falafel,
music, dancing, Israeli feature
ﬁlms and a gala ﬁnale evening.

On Tuesday, the action will be in
Skibo Lobby at Carnegie-Mellon
University. On Wednesday, Thurs-
day and Friday, the Pitt Student
Union will be the scene of Israel
Week activities.

The purpose of this week is to
bring an awareness of Israel—the
way th'e'people live, learn, work
and play—to the campus communi-
ty and the Pittsburgh community at
large. \ .

Exhibits will be open from 11
a.m. until 4 p.m. every day, and
felafel will be sold from 11:30 a.m.
until 2 p.m. The campus activities,
including the Israelifeature ﬁlms,

an-p_.KasabIan, I Love You Rosa, Three

/is Days and A Child, and I Was Born

In Jerusalem, are free and open to
the public.

“Israel in Song, Dance and
Drama," with Gadi Elon, Israeli
actor and singer, will mark the
ﬁnale of Israel Week on Saturday.
Beginning at 7:45 p.m., there will
be an arts and crafts sale. The
program, which starts at 8:30 p.m.,
will be in the Oakland Jewish
Community Center Auditorium,
315 S. Belleﬁeld Ave.

Admission is $1 for students, $2
for nonstudents.

Israel Week wil be sponsored by

cringed back against the wall of the

The footprints in the snow this
year are funny-looking—sort of like
little snowshoe prints.

But they're not from little
Eskimo feet—they’re from Earth
Shoes, or any of the imitations of
the original Kalso brand, negative-
heeled shoes. Nearly every major
shoe store chain in the area now
carries its own version, ranging in
price from $8.99 to $26.99." The
“ofﬁcial” Earth shoes,co,s.t $35 a
pair; the Canadian-made Roots
brand is similarly priced.

Many students tramping around
campus in the shoes probably think
they're doing “something good for
their feet, but the low-heeled
shoes may not be as great as they
think. ‘

Gary Harger, the owner of _a local

' Earth‘ Shoekfranchise, claims the

shoes are better for feet because
they redistribute the weight for
“balanced heel-to-toe walking."
But a Mount Lebanon podiatrist
has said the negative-heel shoe is
deﬁnitely not for people with back
problems and may be harmful to
people with rigid muscle tone.
On the other hand, for people
with very arched feet, (their calf

muscles are shorter than normal). .

the recessed heel has the positive
effect of stretching the calf muscle.

Greek Week, according to Greek
Week cochairman Mark Katz.

“The themeof Greek Week is

‘American Firsts,’ and’ that will
naturally touch on the historical
view,” he said. “We will have a
showcase dealing with Greeks 200
years ago.” ‘

There are 14 sororities and 21
fraternities at Pitt, and their

"    n In 

o forGreek Life

hundreds of members have as
many reasons for joining as their
“independent" counterparts have
for not- joining. ‘

The Pitt News talked with four
students, two independents and
two Greeks, to get a small sample
of some of those reasons.

Jim Gervase, a ﬁfth-year phar-
macy student and membe_r.of Pi
Kappa Alpha, decided to join the
Greek regime eight semesters ago.
Melissa Swoager, a sophomore,

- joined Alpha Delta Pi in an attempt
to “meet new*-people.”

_On the other side of the system,
Richard Giles, an English writing
major, chose to remain indepen-
dent of what he calls “organized
friendship.” Rhetoric and com-
munications major Sam Panno
considers fraternities a case of
“social hierarchy.”

~ Gervase said that when he first
came to Pitt, he had no intention of

. — joining a frat. “I started going to

frats for the parties. Everyone
goes to .the parties their ﬁrst term.
I realized the two times I had fun
during the semester was at the
parties.”

Parties are the frats’ way of
drawing students in, Gervase said.
-“After spending some time at the
frat, watching a football game or
something, you really get to know if
you’d like it. You really can’t get to
know people at a party.” p

Gervase said fraternities provide
the best opportunity for getting to
know people at Pitt, more so than
living in the dorm, where he said
the only thing students have in
common is living on the same ﬂoor.

“In a frat, although the term
‘brotherhood’ is overused, that's
what it is. It’s a good feeling to
know you have 52 friends. I don’t
think you have the opportunity
outside to get a group of guys to

' stick together...like if you have car

trouble, you know there is someone g V

to help you.” A

Gervase said living with a group
of -different people is a good aspect
of frat life. “You have to learn to
put up with people you may not get
along with,” he said. _

The common belief about the
way initiation in a frat is run is a
misconception, according to Ger-
vase. “You want the guys to think
you’re going to do a lot to them, but
we usually don’t,” he said.

. - There have been initiations intc
frats which have ended in tragedy,
such as one in which a student died
when he was left blindfolded in a
mine in Indiana, Pa. Some
initiations have not been so tragic,

. but have been harsh, SIICTI as
branding signs‘ on the pledges
arms. Then there was the case in
which one pledge suffocated in a
sand grave that collapsed over
him.

_ “Things like that don’t happen.
at Pitt, because, if they did,
everybody would hear about it and
the frats would be thrown out of
here,” Gervase said. “However,
some frats do terrible things that
the University shouldn’t tolerate,
such as branding the signs on the
arms.” ’ '
“The pledge class usually has to

' do things such as clean the house.

and they’re tired by the end of the
week, but we don’t do bad things

Gervase rejected the “Buying a

Hey, Got A Dime?

papers?

Aha! I had it. The poor chaps had
probably spent their last dimes
buying milk for their eight hungry
kids. Having been taught to share
and share alike, I decided to give
the papers away———free of charge. It
was the least I could do.

A pleasant-looking gentleman
came walking towards me, a.
cigarette dangling from the corner
of his upper lip; -

“Morning sir. Would you like a
copy of Socialist Weekly?

“No thanks." ’

“But you don't understand sir,"
I pleaded. “You can have it_ for
nothing. I'll give it to you."

He shook his head. “It's not that
I don't want to pay for it son," he
laughed. “I just wouldn’t have the
time to read it. I—stai't work-in ten
minutes."

A Well, Ithought, at least he had a
legitimate excuse for not...Of all
the low-down ' tricks. He had
stopped a little further up the
walkway, bought a fat Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette from a paper box, and

‘slipped into the gates of the steel

mill. No ‘time to read my paper,-
huh?

That's when it dawned on me. It
wasn't that these guys didn't have
a dime to buy my paper. It wasn't
that they 'didn't have the time to
read it. The truth of the matter was
that they didn't want to be seen by
their cronies carrying around a
Socialist newspaper. But there was
a way to remedy that.

“Socialist Weekly? That’s one of

l strode up to the yellow
Post-Ga/.ottc box, and shoved a
nickel and a dime into the slot. Just
in time. There was only one
newspaper left. '

After stuffing a stack of Socialist

‘Wccklys into the middle of the
Gazette, I returned to my spot in
front of the gate. After all, what
was I going to do with all those
Socialist papers? They're too small
to line bird cages with. and too big
to use as handkerchiefs. '

Post-Gazette, Sir?” I piped up
sheepishly, as a mill worker passed
carrying his lunch pail.

He obviously thought I was an
overgrown paperboy trying to earn.
spending money for baseball cards
and ice cream. “Sure son,"
griimed, and handed me 15 cents.

Quickly pocketing the cash, I
took off faster than a mule that's
just been bitten in the rear by a big
green horsefly.

Giles differed with Gervase on
that point. “It does seem that
you're buying a friend,” Giles -said.

“Frats also seem artiﬁcial. It's a
lot of people that get together who
are insecure and need an organized
group to get through.

“I - will admit I was biased
against frats when I came to Pitt,
because it seemed to be organized
friendship,” Giles added. .“Frat
brothers also seem to look down on
people who choose to remain
independent of them.”

 He said another aspect of frats

- ‘/"that he sees as “childish” is the

“wars” between frats. “That's so

stupid, because we're all students I

.in the same position of going to
school," he said.

Swoager said she joined a
sorority after running into a lot of
snobbery on campus. “Until I
rushed it was like being in high
school...the friends I managed to
make weren't permanent,’.’ she
said. “My parents also inﬂuenced

‘ me because they associate going to

school with being in a sorority.”
“I also know now that there are

people that I can count on,”

Swoager said. “It's like the

phrase, ‘I don’t like everyone of my _
_‘§SlSt€1‘S but I love everyone of
E _ tiiﬁm.

I’!

Swoager disputed the belief that
“You can tell a sorority woman by
the perfect hair, makeup and
clothes.” “I don’t know where
people get that sterotype—I’m a
woman and want to look like a
woman,” she said.

Pa., viewed the fraternities there
as “artificial and phony. “When I
went to a few rush parties here at
Pitt, I realized they were the same
as at Allegheny,’.’ Panno said. “I
also find it hard to believe that you
could ‘love’ 52 people.

“I. guess it’s also important

about the type of people frats

appeal to,” Panno said. “Some
people enjoy huge, blasting parties
and some enjoy sitting around
having a few beers with a few
friends. _ ‘ V

“I found it very" satisfying to
come to the city and make friends
on my own without a frat’s help,”
he said. “I know I’ll stick with the
same friends through school and

they’d stick by me when I needed ‘

help.”

Panno said he didn’t like the
“class situation” in fraternities. “I
don’t like that type of social
hierarchy,” he said. “You' either
belong or you don’t belong-
there’s no middle ground.”

The opening of the new Law
Building this month could signal a
rise in the prestige of Pitt among
the. country's law schools, accord-
ing to Law School Campaign
Manager Robert G. Wydo.

A recent University of Denver

survey ranked Pitt among the top
.30 of 160 law schools in the
country, and Wydo forecasts a rise
in Pitt's ranking to the top ten by
the 1980s.

“We're confident that our school
will climb into the top 10 in the next
decade," Wydo said. “Because of
the facilities we now have. we're
attracting better faculty and higher
caliber of student.

“We've been able to attract four
new faculty members as a result of
expansion. and applications for
admission have risen,” Wydo
added. “We're "getting a reputa-
tion as one of the hot law schools

among professors, a school that's _

on its way up."

According to Wydo, Pitt law
student profiles, based on under-
graduate _QPAs and Law School

Admission Tests, are about the '

same as the University of Michigan
School’s. Michigan is considered
the seventh-leading law school in
the nation. / ' '

However, a check of this year’s
PI-claw Handbook proved the
»Michigan profiles are significantly
higher. -

“Students consider Pitt one of
the best law schools in the area, so
applications are increasing stead-

, ily," Wydo said. "We have room

for 700 students, but it is doubtful
we'll reach that ﬁgure due to the
shortage of jobs right now. We'll
probably keep our enrollment at
around 550," Wydo said.

The new building dwarfs the old
arrangement on the 14th floor of
the Cathedral. Four large class-
rooms and -five smaller seminar
rooms can accommodatea total of

over 800 students at once, as
opposed to the total ﬁve rooms in
the Cathedral, which served only
about 500 students. For the 525
students currently enrolled, this
makes for greater ease in schedul-
ing and less chance of being shut
out.

Office space is adequate, with
some empty ofﬁces awaiting the
arrival of new faculty in the next
few years. - ~

The core of the top three floors in
the ﬁve-story building serve as the
library, compared to the cramped
quarters on the fifth and 14th floors
of the Cathedral last term.‘ The
library alone is larger than the
entire old law complex.

The expanded library contains

Unions for Military Proposed

BY MARILYN ZRUST

Labor unions have found their
way into almost every occupation
except the armed forces. Recently,
the Association of Civilian Techni-
cians (ACT), the National Maritime
Union (NMU) and the American
Federation of Government Em-
ployes (AFGE) have proposed
unions for the military.

The AFGE currently represents
300,000 due-paying members and
bargains on behalf of 750,000
federal employes, many of whom
are in the Defense. Department.
Affiliated with the AFL-CIO, the
AFGE is anxious for military
membership. AFGE President
Clyde M. Weber said the union
could represent members in
courts-martial, ﬁle suits to protest
unfavorable military administrative

action and work to improve
salaries.
The ACT represents civilian

employes of the -National Guard,

and the _Air Force and Army‘

Reserves. Because the civilian
members must be guard or. reserve
members, the ACT already is
considered a military union.

Merchant seamen and civilian
crews serving under Navy officers
aboard tankers and supply vessels
are represented-by the NMU.

While still in its early stages, the
idea of unionization has aroused
opposition. Though the military in
the Netherlands, Sweden and West
Germany have union representa-
tion, U.S. officials do not feel
unionization would be in the best
interest of the armed forces.

“We'd ﬁght it to the death,”
said one Pentagon spokesman.
“There’s no way you can have an
army that way."

The armed forces have made
many major changes within the
system during the past few years,
according to Colonel James Bam-
bery, ROTC commander for the
Pittsburgh area.

L ._ Bambery questioned the purpose
behind the attempts for unioniza-
tion.

“The Army today is not the
Army of 10 ‘or 20 years ago,"
Bambery said. “It has kept pace

with society and has done it without’

the aid of a union.”

‘‘In the functions of the armed
forces in peace and war, and in
preparing for conflict," Bambery
continued, “the presence of a
union would be an obstacle to
authority.”

Cadet Staff Sergeant JFred
Forsythe and Cadet Second Lieut-
enant Bob Pellegrini, two Pitt
ROTC students, also are not in

'favor of military unionization.

struction of discipline as we know
it," Forsythe said. “In the
situation of a national emergency
this could not be permitted.
“The permission to bargain for
wages might act as an inflationary
agent which could eventually lead
to an increase in taxes," he said.
Pellegrini also was concerned
about the decline in authority.
“The idea of the Army’s ranking is
to have ‘ one boss," he said.
“Unionization would set up a
second chain of command. One
might end up torn between two
commands."

Death Taboo
Explored ln

C-MU Lecture

BY MARILYN ZRUST

Attitudes about death, dying and
its pragmatic consequences were
explored Tuesday night in the first
of six such lectures at Carnegie-
Mellon University (C-MU).

The writing of wills and donation
of bodies to science are among the
topics the series will raise to help
individuals deal with death.

Tuesday night’s speaker, Daniel

' McGuire from the theology de-

partment at Marquette University,

related the American perspective

of death to that of other cultures.
McGuire, the author of Death of

“Strikes would mean the de- 

~‘x‘*»_.;,_‘.,
._ \‘ y »

6:.
-,..

i/‘

Chance, Death by Choice, said of _

talking about death: ‘‘I never get
tired of it." Despite the taboo, it is
not a subject to be avoided, he said.
‘Medicine has increased the
average person’s life span from 18
years in prehistoric times to 78
years, McGuire said. Still, he feels
that medical technology often

offers only a half-cure that puts 

many people in a better-off-deadly‘

situation.

Death should be allowed at a
more humane time, McGuire
suggested. “When a person is
beyond healing, he is no longer a
candidate for medicine. We have a
moral right, in certain circumstan-

’ ces, to end our lives.”

When questioned about the
morality of euthanasia, McGuire,
quoting St. Thomas Acquinas,
said, “Humans act right or wrong,
good or bad, according to circum-
stances.”

, Americans may be erasing the
taboo on mercy-killing, he said. A
1950 Gallop poll showed that only

. __ 7
,,_r~".

33% of the public approved of it,¥¢i%

but a more recent pollshowed a

~ 20% increase. .-

He listed three grounds on whic
some people disapprove.

Proponents of the “domino” or
“wedge” theory insist, “If you
allow this one case, the wedge is
driven in’and the dominoes fall,”
McGuire explained.

The second objection is the
accusation that mercy-killers are
“playing God.”

The third objection, the hope
.that someday there will be a cure,
is unfounded, McGuire said,
because “medicine is so secretive
that arrivals of cures are not always
known.”

“There are times when ending a

life is the best thin -that life 
g 

offers,” he concluded. ‘ _
The ability to face death, “gives
us peace in the face of death.”
The second lecture, on Tuesday,
will focus on facing death.

Arthur Miller was called before
the House Un-American Commit-
tee in 1956 and refused to
participate in this modern day
witch hunt. With these proceedings
in mind, he fashioned a powerful
drama, The Crucible, in which the
heroes refuse to admit to crimes
they didn’t commit. Composer
Robert Ward seized on the idea of a
musical form of the play. In 1961
the opera, The Crucible, premiered
in New York, City. Last night the
opera premiered in Pittsburgh with
as much success as its first
performance in the “Big Apple.”

The entire production reeked of
suspicion plus. The ' eerie\back-
drops, the shells of buildings that
were just enough to convey the
ideas intended, and especially the
music projected the haunting
feelings. Barbara Karp’s direction
seemed inspired as the fever of
accusations spread over the entire

" -“I’m waiting for a day when-

Thus began Ruby Dee's repertoire.

uee, an actress, has appeared in
olavs such as Purlie Victorious and
A Raisin in the Sun. Reading from
the works of black writers such as
Langston Hughes, she captivated
those assembled in the Student

Billed as a strong spokeswoman
for the black liberation movement,
Dee is particularly concerned with
the promotion of black writers and
black literature. “I didn’t become
familiar with any black writers until
after college,” she said. “They
were not included in the antholo-
gies, in the general studies of
American Literature. It’s been a
deprivation for the black people.
The are a people cutoff from their

ed.

At points when the cast and
chorus performed, the pace of the
show was kept on its toes. The
denouncing of Abigail Williams by
John Proctor, and the hanging
scene at the ﬁnale are two
examples of effective staging and

suspenseful drama.

Ward’s composing left nothing
to be_ desired. ’Wagerian tones
blared from the orchestra and the
singers competed with the ensem-
ble several times. Perhaps Ward
could have toned the music down in
certain dramatic places where the
musicians got carried away.

Ward did conduct this perfor-
mance and the cast responded to
his touch with more vigor’ than
ever.

Individual performances ranged
from dynamic to weak. Dramatics
rated highon the bill, as some of
the best character-acting came
from MildredpMiller and Gwenlynn
Little. Little’s voice matched her

dramatic talents but unfortunately
this was not the case with Miller.
For some reason her voice couldn't
quite make it. She has a stronger
voice than last night’s performance
led you to believe, and upagainst a
vocally excellent cast, she was dis-
appointing.

Physical presence conveyed by

,Judge Danforth (Alan Crofoot),

the Reverend John Hale (Will Roy)
and John Proctor, (Julian Patrick)
beamed out at the audience.
Patrick was in his glory and reveled
in the role, as did anyone watching.
His part is the hero’s, and Patrick
came off as the virtuous man Miller
intended (perhaps a bit of
autobiography here?).

The servant Tituba portrayed by
‘Hilda Harris exhibited some ﬁne
acting talents as well as a voice
similar to that of Leontyne Price,

excellent portrayal of one woman's
paranoia. It is the story of a_ woman
who is convinced someone is going

ex-husband, her married lover, the
obscene phonecaller that whisper-

evening. Or perhaps it could be the
old, fat woman who was the family

Who would pull the trigger, or

portraits and witty animal carica-
tures posed in letter shapes. She
crowns a splendid display of design
ability with the “Flight of the
Carpet-Bird” series.

“The Carpet-Bird” skirts her
wings for takeoff in the representa-
tion, followed by two gliding
sketches in which the bird itself
revels in its beauty and composi-
tion. The last sequence shows the
bird, throat exposed. collapsing
into a bed of flowers. Though done
solely in‘ charcoal and ink, Broker
conveys the dazzle of her creation.
In fact, the viewer feels the
addition of color unnecessary, if not
too much.

“Capture of the Carpet Bird” by Karin Broker is now on display at i
the King Center Exhibition in East Liberty.

 (Continued from Page 12)

-threatening faces at dark windows

to lend credence to Mrs. Hexam’s

~ fears.

Throughout the story, the reader
can never forget the internal battle
waging. in Mrs. Hexam’s mind.
There is fear in her mind, not just

the fear of the unknown—of what

may happen, but the more complex
terror that the shadow she fears"-'
does not exist at all.

That is the battle within the

. book, the question of a paranoia
that may never be fully resolved.

- The Shadow Knows is a superb
book, but not one to read when

- alone in the house and the wind

howls outside.

was upset by Edinboro state 64-56

Wednesday night at the Field

House. The loss marked the first
Pitt defeat of the regular season,
leaving the Pantherettes’ record at
7-2.

Edinboro (13-3) took 1an early
lead over an uncommonly sloppy
Pitt squad. The Scots, who actually
played the game wearing kilts, play
a one-on-one game -the Panther-
ettes were unable to cope with.
The Pitt defense was still intact but
couldn’t contain the extremely
quick Edinboro offense’ with its
superb dribbling. The Panther-

"ettes’ offense was virtually non-

existent and Edinboro led 28-19 at
the half.

led by as much as 14 points until

Basketball fans, will have a treat
this weekend when the Panthers
and the Duquesne Dukes host the

 Catsﬂeady for“Classic” showing

tonight, and Pitt and the University
of Pennsylvania will cap off the
evening with what should be a
good, close game.

Penn, which has a tradition of
powerhouse basketball teams, is
off to its worst start in six years.
The 6-7 Quakers have been
plagued with injuries, the most
damaging being a knee injury to
6-11 senior center Henry Johnson.
He’s out for the season.

Last year’s standout starter, 6-8
John Engles, suffered through two
preseason knee operations and is
still feeling the effects of a slow
recovery. Nonetheless, Engles is‘
averaging 15.6 points and seven
rebounds a game.

average. Throw in 6-6 forward Bill --

5:.

Jones, a 10-point-per-game scorer,
and you're putting up the one thing

with which the Panthers have had 1

trouble with all year—that dom-
inating forward wall.

Rebounding, especially defen-
sive rebounding, could well be the
deciding factor in tonight’s contest.
If you give three double-ﬁgure
scorers a second shot from three
feet away, you’ve got troubles.

Penn is a long way from its teams
of old. The Quakers have won six
consecutive Ivy League crowns,

of those seasons.

Kelly No Phillyﬂeject  

BY CRIS HALL

Despite the recent controversy
concerning the use of the term
“scholar-athlete,” there is no room
for debate when the title is used to

-describe Willie Kelly. 1

Kelly, like most of his Panther
teammates, is on a scholarship. But
his is academic, not athletic.

A senior history major who hopes
to ﬁnd a’ job teaching high school,
“Willie from Philly” has meshed
athletics and academics into what
he considers a good experience at
Pitt.

“Sure, athletics hurts your
grades—there’s practice every day
and sometimes you're on the road
three days a week. But you get so
much out. of it——-enjoyment, tra-
vel——that you don’t mind. I know
l’ve gotten a lot more out of it than
I thought i' would.”

Kelly entered the Pitt basketball
program as a walk-on from
Overbrook High School, home of a
very tall, ganglv kid named Wilt

Chamberlain. In addition to his
coming from the same tall and
lanky mold, Kelly reminds one of
“The Stilt” because of his
number—Kelly chose Wilt’s num-
ber because“‘Chamberlain was my
athletic idol." ‘ -
His reasons for attending Pitt

included the school’s* athletic.

reputation and the fact it was a big
“city” school. He has not been
disappointed. ‘

ever could have while here."

season, Kelly is enjoying his ﬁnest
year as a Panther in this, his ﬁnal
season. Nicknamed “Willie the,
Rejector” because of his often-
spectacular shot-blocking, Kelly
has been a ﬁxture in the Panther
starting lineup of late.

Playing “swing forward” posi-
tion in Pitt’s offense, Kelly has
contributed 7.5 points per game to
the Pitt attack, while under the
boards, he has an average of 5.6
rebounds percontest. The unlikely
star also leads the Panthers in
shot-blocking, with three times the

‘ total of Larry Harris, his nearest

competitor. _

With only 180 pounds to call his
own, the 6-6 senior could be at a
disadvantage underneath, but Kel-
ly holds his own. “I like to1thiAnk of

Tennessee State.

Pitt has many other key runners
to watch. Karl Farmer, who was
ninth in the 440 at the NCAAs, will
run his speciality, while Dan
Schuerle and Kevin Carpenter will
set the pace in the 50-yard hurdles.
Willie Walker is a valuable asset in
the sprints and mile relay.

Pitt is well-balanced and boasts
talent in every event. Bob Lee and
John Heiser in the long distance
races, along with Tom Herrmann,
Ron Wirick, Rich Moore and Ron
Morris in the relays, round out the

1" Panther running attack.

The high point of the field events
will be the long jump competition.
Six jumpers have already sailed
beyond the 24-foot marker. John
Davenport and Neville Sinclair of
Maryland have both gone 25 feet
plus. Sam Onwuli from Hagers-
town Junior College also is
expected to be a top competitor.

Sophomore Keith Taylor will
show his versatility by competing
in the high jump and triple jump.
However, competition will be stiff
in the high jump. The Maryland
jumpers have both cleared 6-10_.

may be because of three vaulters
who have cleared 16 feet: Bill

Gifford (PSU), Keith Neff (Virginia

Freshman Eric Drescher will be
throwing the shot, hoping to better
his best of 54 feet when Tom
Anderson (Michigan) challenges
reign in the Field House.

The relay events will see Pitt,
Baldwin-Wallace and Maryland in
a rematch of last year's close race
in the mile relay, always a heated
event when archrivals Pitt, West
Virginia and Penn State start
together. However, Mt. St. Mary's
and Delaware State are not to be
forgotten.

“I think we will do well at the
Invitational because of the out-
standing team quality. Plus, there
will be a home crowd situation that
will help, and our players are
getting up for this meet,”
Agostinella said.

“The philosophy of the track

point out to our athletes what they
do well. If you have a negative
program and keep pointing out the
negative things, then the kids
practice them.

“I have found the positive
program to have the best results for
the team, and it is most satisfying
for the athlete. When youreinforce

starts to practice them.”

Dr. Kildare would fail miserably.

The entire M-A-S-H unit would
be sent screaming and laughing
hysterically after trying to save this

The patient is the Pitt wrestling
team's starting lineup—a lineup

in the past two weeks. And a lineup
that has to be decided by tomorrow
night, when the Panthers host
Millersville State at the Field
House at 8.

The starting roster has been in
the sickbed since Pitt’s last match
(a 20-19 win over Bloomsburg
State). But now, it's been moved
into the emergency ward.

“We’ve had lots of ﬂus and
injuries this week,” Head Coach
Dave Adams said.

Lotsand lots of injuries; not only
have Rande Stottlemyer (back
injury) and Skip Bolin (emergency
appendectomy) been scratched
from tomorrow night’s lineup, but
also Ray Dallatore, George O’Korn

believes he has an antidote for his
team.

' “We’ve had a series of elimina-
tions to see who will start,” he

-explained. “The best man avail-

able at that certain weight will
wrestle tomorrow."

The best man better be
available; Millersville State is a
team not to be taken lightly.
Sporting a 7-2 record, State makes
everyone sick with fear, including
134-pounder Andy Zook, 167-
pounder Kurt Clark, 171-pounder
Dennis Fenton an"d‘ "190-pounder
Eric Guyll.

But Adams’ confidence
higher than a fever. ‘_

“We had to do the job last week
(against Bloomsburg),” Adams
claimed, “and we’ll have to do it a
gain this week. This match will
determine how good a team we
really are. We’ll make a very’ good
showing.” ~

Adams has reason to be
confident. First, his Panthers are
10-1 overall this season, with a 2-0
record in the Eastern Wrestling
League, and nationally ranked.
Second, Pitt dominated Millersville
St. on the road 28-13 last year. So,
if they won so easily last year,
what’s to stop a repeat of that
performance this season?

"lt’ll be a real tight match,”
Adams explained. “Injuries always
make it a different story. But
we're going to have to buckle down
and wrestle. Like Chuck Noll
always says, ‘whatever it takes.’ ”

And it will take a lot. Hard work,
aggressiveness, ‘and confidence-
that’s the best prescription for a
win.

' I ~, BY STEVE SYBERT

 Ever notice how the worst kid on
‘aff little league baseball team is
placed in right ﬁeld? Or the least
‘talented member of a .san.dlot
football team on the offensive line?
"?-The same is true for a beginning
hockey player who, when outshone
by his "sharp-shooting teammates.
is tucked neatly away from the
_action as a defenseman and sent
chasing the puckowhen the other
«team has possession.

‘right-ﬁelder becomes the guy with
the strongest throwing armeand the
‘offensive lineman finally gets
credit‘ for springing a halfback free.
"And. the hockeyrdefenseman starts
- -making game-saving plays to quell
" accusations against him too.

, Russ’ Stump of the Pitt Hockey
Club is one such defenseman. He
~ »w'asn’t put on the back line by some

fpositxion because there is a deﬁnite
job to be- done.

he-‘said, “because I was bigger and

 playing with and I have always

: B Since his start in hockey at age
 ..l53‘, ‘Stump has acquired the
4;; r E reputation of being a defenseman’s
‘ 'defens,eman,” sort of a Dave
_, ‘Burrows type. If you’d read in a
J ihockey instruction book, “A

;‘ that defenseman.

“I play all defense more or less

 “Burrows is a fantastic defense-
man. You hardly ever see anyone

offense-minded, but he gets his job
done too by bringing the puck out
of the zone. It’s hard to say who is
‘  better, but I like Burrows because

penalty-minutes better measure his
aggressive role as the Pitt goalie’s
best friend.

“My job is to get the puck out of
our zone as fast as I can," said the
sophomore back-liner. “Ihave to
get it to the wingers and not
playaround with it like some guys
do." -

In the course of a game, a

' defenseman takes much‘ physical

abuse. Only the goalie, somewhat
aided by more equipment and
padding, is under a ﬁercer attack.

“The worst part of defense is

getting zinged on the sides of the _

ankles," Stump said. “When a guy
winds up, _if you put your legs
together, theﬁpuck will bounce of
the front of your shin guards, but
then it can also hit the top of your
feet and that doesn’t feel so good
either. But you don’t think about
those things when you’re out
there." -

Another thing a defenseman
doesn't think about is the conse-
quence pf putting his body in the
path of a ﬂying puck- Keith
Magnuson of the Chicago Black
Hawks didn’t think about it until
one smashed into his jaw several
years ago.

“You’ve got to be goofy to drop
in front of a shot,” Stump said,
“but you do it by instinct, not
thinking about what could happen
to yourself. I’ve never taken a puck
in the face, but once I got plastered
by the blade of the stick» on a guy’s
follow-through and was knocked
out."

Stump had his teeth rearranged
by a “cheap shot" from a Gannon
player in last year’s brawl-ﬁlled
contest, but looks at such happen-
ings, like most hockey players, as
part of the game. He will dish out
punishment to opposing players in
return and all for the sake of a little
rubber disc.

Last year, the future looked as
bright as an Olympic medal to the
Pitt gymnastics team: Head Coach
lg Perez had one of the most
promising squads in the country
with Rob Pasterick, Don Stevenson
and Gus Papantonio ready to serve
as all-arounds their junior year.

But it wasn't to be. Pasterick
and Papantonio were lost to
preseason injuries, and Stevenson
was hurt, he could compete in only
four events.

them in freshman Doug Smith and

Frank Klein—the latter a sopho-r

more economics major who has
made tremendous strides since his
rookie season and now ﬁnds much
responsibility weighing on his
shoulders as he balances on the
high bar.

Klein’s progression is all the
more remarkable, when you
consider that last season was his
ﬁrst with an organized team.

“The thing about Frank is, when
he came here as a freshman, he’d
never been on a gymnastics team,”
Perez said. I “As a result, he did not
work all-around--he A did the high
bar. He worked basic moves on the
other apparatus.
thingis, when the time came, he
was ready.”

Although 1975 provided Klein
with his ﬁrst actual competition,
gymnastics had fascinated him
since his days. in junior high in
Binghamton, ‘ N.Y. Sokol, a
Czechoslovakian organization that
stresses physical ﬁtness through
gymnastics, (and a group in which
Klein was active) started a program
for a couple of weeks and, after

' that,’ Klein was hooked.

As Main Endwell High School
had no competitive gymnastics
program, Klein and a few friends
started their own team, coached by
one of the member's father.

Perez shifted his‘

The ' amazing »

As a member of the Pitt team,
Klein’s basic requirements for a
gymnast are simple. ‘

“There ' are three important
things,” he said. “One is to be
light, extremely light; you can’t
have an ounce of fat on you. The
second thing is strength and the
third is ﬂexibility.”

While his coach cites being able
to cope under pressure as“ the
greatest improvement Klein has
made, Klein himself sees handling
the fatigue that hits aigymnast
toward meet’s end as a major
accomplishment. _

“You try to improve and keep
cool,” he said. “You try to work
out of errors and don’t let it affect
the rest of your performance.

“You can’t get any better than
the people you see around you-—-it

‘ coach—just being around him you

can feel it."

The unfortunate St. Petersburg‘

incident, in which team members
were accused of illicit tippling, not
to mention the dismal Panther
season, has not dulled Kelly’s
optimism. “This is going to be one
of the top programs in the
country,” Kelly predicted——but he
warned, “Often one program is
sacriﬁced for another, but that

hasn't happened yet. Pitt is going ‘

in its basketball and
programs two national

to have
football
powers.”
No matter how big the program
gets, Kelly maintains an interest-
ing perspective. “The fans are just
as important as the players. That's
what we’re out there for—the
students. _
“I’ve from

helps to see the people who are , '6.
tops in their field. Temple was a 
good match; I learned a lot.”

Klein’s ﬁrst event, the high bar,
remains his favorite because “it’s
the most fun; you’re the most free,
and you’ve got a lot of movement
and hardly any restrictions.”

“I spend three to six hours daily
working out,” Klein said.
“There’s a lot of personal
satisfaction in gymnastics—you get
as much out of it as you put in it.

It's a hard sport; that's probably
why I’m in it.”

And preparing for Saturday’s 7

does Klein remain true to his; ;-?3?\:

CIGARETTE TAX THE ONLY
HIKE C
HARRISBURG (AP)—The

Shapp administration will ask for
an increase only in the cigarette tax
when it presents the 1976-77
budget to the legislature‘ next
week. -

Richard A. Doran,
assistant tO Gov. Shapp, told the
new
budget will be balanced without
any hike in the state personal
income, corporate income orsales
taxes. M

Only cigarettes will be higher, at
a nickel more a pack, increasing
that tax to 23 cents.

“The budget is balanced without
any. gimmicks and without any
game’-playing,” Doran said.

Another source in .the state’s
Budget Office said the new budget
would provide only modest in-
creases in spending for day-care

centers, the aged, the state-;;ﬁ

colleges and other programs.

And no‘ hikes -are reported
planned in welfare grants or the
state’s subsidies
