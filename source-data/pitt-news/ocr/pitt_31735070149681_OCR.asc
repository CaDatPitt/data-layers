  -tolow voter

tumout in
Oakland

By'Michael Ringling
Staff Writer

A Compared to other districts in Al-'

legheny County, Oakland voters
don’t show up in large numbers at
the polls. ' _
In the 2008 presidential gen-
eral election, Oakland voters turned
out in signiﬁcantly lower numbers
than the rest of Allegheny County.
Oakland saw 48.4 percent of its
4,405 registered voters at the polls,
whereas Allegheny Countysaw 68.8
percent of its 956,114 voters. _
These poll numbers mark a na-
tionwide trend among one of Oak-
land’s main demographic groups:
low voter turnout among 18- to
24—year—olds. ‘

Kristin Kanthak, a Pitt political-

science professor, said that many
factors play into a demographic’s
turnout. She said those factors in-
clude the Voter’s marriage status,

education level and whether the

voter has lived in the same place
over the course of many years.
“All the things that make you
more likely to Vote, [students]
have less of,” Kanthak said. “-It’s
not there’s something wrong with
Pitt students. It’s that students [in
general] don’t vote.”
. She said that it is more diﬂicult
for young voters to ﬁnd out where
their polling place is, ﬁnd the poll-
ing place itself and ﬁnd transporta-
tion to the voting booth. Students

_ can ﬁnd most of this information

online, through Pennsylvaniefs De-
partment of State. ' '

Zach Wahls just likes to call it mar-
riage. ‘

' “My moms aren’t gay married. I
don’t come home and say, ‘Oh! My
gay moms are home.’ They don’t
live in a gay house or drive a gay
car,” Wahls said.

Zach Wahls’ remarks were part
of his hour-long lecture, “What
Makes a Family,” on Thursday

~ night in the O’Hara Student Center.

Active Minds.

Wahls became an Internet sen-
sation after testifying in the Iowa
House of Representatives on Jan.
31, 2011, during a public forum
for the House Joint Resolution 6,
a resolution proposing an amend-
ment in Iowa’s constitution that
would only recognize marriage be-
tween aman and a woman. There,

the spoke about marriage equality
. and his own upbringingby two

lesbian moms.

Two days after his testimony,
his Video on YouTube went viral
with more than 2 million hits. To-
day, the speech has more than 16
million hits.

Wahls, who travels around

the country to tell his story while

juggling engineering classes at the
University of Iowa‘, spoke about
how the LGBTQ community today
faces marriage restrictions simi-
lar to the ones interracial couples
faced 50 years ago.

He said that he was conceived
when Terry, his mother, used arti-
ﬁcial insemination in 1990. Wahls
said he does not want to meet his
biological father.

Growing up with "two moms
hasn’t negatively affected him in
anyway, he said, although he con-
fessed it had made him a little more
considerate. _

“I’m really good at ‘putting the
seat down,” Wahls said. “And I can
ask for directions.”

He said that his mothers in-

Internet sensation Zack Wahls talksgay rights

stilled him with courage, discipline
and strength —-, values that are not
exclusively masculine, he said.

“I didn’t have a dad, but I don’t
think that was an emotionally trau-
matizing experience,” Wahls said.
“Having a momand dad is not vital
to everyone’s success.”

But in middle school, students
called him names like “faggot.”
Wahls noted a lot of teenagers are

‘rejected by their family when they.

come out, and are often told they
are perverted or have a mental
disorder.

“More than 40 percent of all
homeless kidsin this country are.

According to the United States Census

’ Bureau, 89.6 percent of the 146,311,000
- registered voters nationwide voted in the

2008 general election. But only 83 percent
of thosepeople registered in the 18-to-24
age range cast a ballot; This number was the
lowest percentage of any age range that the
census recorded. 9

registered: voters — the 18—to—24 age range
increased" itsvoter turnout from 46.7 percent
in 2004 to-48:.-5 percent in 2008.

- Professors and students alike gave reasons
for thelow youth voter turnout, as well as the
possible effects it has on elections.

in comparison to older demographics plays
a role in how candidates-campaign.

“[Candidates] are going to spend time _

to vote for [them] ,” Dancey said. “Potentially,
elected ofﬁcials might be less concerned with
young people if they don’t vote.”

Iy Tracey Hickey
Columnist

  

Today, I’m going to teach you the I

art of intervention. .

_ ‘ I’m not talking about “Interven- A
tion,” the A&E reality show where

the friends and ‘family of addicts
confront their loved ones in the
most dramatic possible fashion.
I’m talking about those situa-
tions where a friend, roommate,
resident, signiﬁcant other or mere
acquaintance seems to be in big

trouble, and you’re not qualiﬁed 

to give them the help they need '—_
and don’t know how to convince
them to get it. _Have you ever known
someone whose boyfriend or girl-
friend seemed to make decisions

for them, or a couple who said they _

‘were madly in love, but called each

‘ other horrible names whenever

they fought? '~
Ever. doubted a friend’s expla-
nation about how he got those

_injuries, or wondered whether

someone was really joking about
killing himself? Have you ever been

‘in the women’s bathroom and heard

someone throwing up, and couldn’t
shake the feeling that she was doing
it on purpose?

Most people will ﬁnd them-
selves in circumstances like this at
some point. These situations are
frightening because they put lay-
people —— people.with no training

s

or experience dealing with this kind
of fragile situation —' in positions
where they feel obligated to speak
up, and where their actions may
“ have enormous impact. _

Done correctly, this kind of in-
tervention — the act of one per-
son saying to another, “I’m worried
about you, and I think youmight
want to seek some help”'—' can
literally be lifesaving. And on a
campus as big as Pitt’s, it’s critical
for students to look out for each
other’s well-being and learn to
speak up when something doesn’t
look right. ,

I’ve been on both ends of this
kind of outreach on more than one
occasion, and here are afew things
I’ve learned. . ' _

Firstof all, do some research.
Nobody expects you to be an ex-
pert on their problems. If you were
a licensed therapist, you wouldn’t
need to be reading this column,
but a little bit of browsing on repu-
table websites goes a long way. If
you think a friend could be suffer:
ing from depression, researching
their condition enables you to talk
to them about the symptoms they’re
experiencing beyond, “You seem
really sad lately.” ’

Likewise, a little bit of reading
‘on the cycle of relationship abuse
can mean the difference between
sounding as if you just don’t like
your roommate’s girlfriend, or be-
ing able to articulate: “After you

tiate an intervention

. ' have these horrible ﬁghts where she
screams and threatens you, she’s
always really sweet for a little while,
but things go right back to the way
they were after three weeks, and
she does it again.”

The conversation should be pri-
vate. This shouldn’t need to be said,
but it’s critical. '

I struggled with self—harm to-

. ward the end of my senior year of
high school. Unlike most, I rarely
tried to conceal my injuries, un-
less I was at _home with my family.
At school, I didn’t expect anybody
to notice, and anyway, it was hot
out. ' _

Needless to say, this didn’t quite
work out. More thanone person
realized that I appeared to have
been attacked by the world’s most
methodical cat, and more than one
person asked me, loudly and in
front of an entire classroom, what
the hell I did to myself. ,

I lied to every one of those peo-
ple, and I didn’t feel bad about it
either. Irationalized that if these
concerned souls had wanted an
honest answer, they would have
pulled me aside and asked about my
injuries privately instead of singling
me out in front of a group.

Contrary to the traditional “In-
tervention” model, I also don’t rec-
ommend recruiting other people
to help you get your point across.
Nobody likes to be ganged up on,

    Technology won't el

Meet Adam. He’s a scientist who
uses logic, formulates his own hy-
potheses, tests those hypotheses
and compiles results — all on his
own. His hypotheses about the

functions of certain yeast genes, ‘

for instance, derive from his own
reading of the yeast genome.

Oh, and he’s a robot. Did Ifor- .
get to mention that?

In a 2009 article in Science
magazine, researchers presented

their creation, Adam, as proof

that science had become auto-
mated. The researchers gave this
combined robot and computer
the logical language necessary to
reason on his own. They gave him
all the known genetic information
about yeast. They put yeast cells
in his little freezer. Then, they
informed him of 13 genes that sci-
entists had not yet discovered a
function for.

Of the 13 mysterious genes,
Adam successfully determined
the function of‘12.- The Science ,
article details how the research-
ers used‘ their own methodology
to conﬁrm Adam’s work.

What are the implications of
this development? Will this tech-

nology deprive sc_ience of human

agency? Is this yesteryear’s light
microscope, or does a robot
carrying out entire experiments
mean a certain threshold has
been breached, and that, at some
point, scientists will become ob-

method by which'the cell per-
forms quality control on protein
manufacturing.

The Pitt News: What do you

make of this recent development? - 0

Does this mean science is becom-.
ing automated? '

Brodskyi There is a genera--

tional trend. Each generation of

scientists has looked at the previ— ‘

ous and has been impressed by
how hard it was and how easy it
has become. For example, when I
was a graduate student, ‘it would
take one’ month to sequence a ge-
nome. Now itnever takes more
than 24 hours. In the generation
before mine, a_ graduate thesis
could consist of purifying a re-
striction enzyme —— an enzyme
that cuts the DNA molecule at
-certain positions —- and now, you
simply order it from a company.

TPNE Does such rapid, au-
tomated technology take away
from human agency in scientiﬁc
research? -

Brodsky: We are not letting
go of that creative touch. Great
moments in biology have come
from people that have thought
completely outside of the box.

Sometimes, biology is illogical '

and so not suited for a cornputer’s
reasoning. For example, a scien-
tist, through a brilliant experi-
ment, discovered jumpinggenes
—— genes that move around in a
genome. No computer could have
done this. ’

The computer uses 'mecha-
nisms that are deductive and
reductive. This results in the
simplest conclusion — Occam’s
Razor. The simplest conclusion is
not always the case in biology. Bi-
ology doesn’t always reduce to the

simplest explanation, nor does it
always follow some sort of logic.
The illogical, the surprises keep
me getting up in the morning.
TPN: What do these sorts of
developments mean for you?

Brodsky: It means people like _

me have to comeup with hypoth-
eses faster. b V -

TPN: What do you foresee in I

the future?

Brodsky: I look forward to a

day when I will become interested ‘

in a gene, andclick a button to see
if it appears in the genomes of
5,000 people with a disease, and
in the genomes of 5,000 people
without a disease. This can lead
to personalized medicine. Also,
such a database c_o.ul_d allow‘peo-
ple with hypotheses don the effects
of a gene "to easily test them.

Brodsky also noted the /ability

of humans to pick up on nuances. ‘

If a robot read a body of statistics
and found a characteristic devia-
tion from a mean, it would write
it off as an error. A human might
be intrigued if such a deviation
appeared repeatedly. Perhaps
it would be a clue to something
overlooked. _
Brodsky also mentioned that

there are already computer pro— ~
grams meant to simulate doctors. ‘

Patients type in their symptoms
and information, and the com-

puter, using algorithms and alda- '

tabase of diseases and symptoms,
churns out a diagnosis. It’s been
demonstrated that such programs
are much more accurate than real

. doctors’ diagnoses. A .

- But again, thei:e’s somethin
_missing: nuance. Doctors can
usually tell when patients are ly-

c

ing. They can also tell if they’re
hiding ‘something e something
typed text cannot convey. Some-
timesa speech pattern or set of
mannerisms implies a mental ill-
ness. Computers cannot yet pick
these up. ' ’ ‘

I think we can answer some
of my initial questions ‘now. _Cer-
tainly, such technology portends
increased efficiency and accuracy
in the future, butwill comput-
ers replace scientists and doc-
tors? It doesn’t seem likely. It’s

« human nature to be curious, see I

 

5

iminate the need feihuman scientists 

patterns and sometimesthink il-
logically. It’s also in human nature
to connect with other humans,
' help them through a diagnosis

and understand them beyond a V

paragraph of symptoms.

‘Technology continues to ad-‘

Vance science and medicine, but

it will never replace humans in

those disciplines —— it’s just a gen-

erational tool for professionals

BigEast compete in the Big Dance

By R] Sepich
Staff‘ Writer '

It is an impressive feat that the Big
East men’s basketball conference,
despite having a down year talent-
wise, was still able _to produce nine

NCAA Tournament teams — more ‘

than any other ‘conference in the
nation. ’

But before Connecticut’s mem-
orable run to a national champion-
ship last season, Big East teams
struggled to ﬁnd success with the
pressure—packed, one-and-done
style of the NCAA Tournament.

With Syracuse, the conference’s
best team, now without its best in-.
ferior defender for the duration of

the tournament, and the remaining

cluster of Big East teams plagued
by inconsistencies, it’s difficult to
envision a scenario where any Big
East team could make a legitimate
run at the title. .

‘But that’s exactly what makes

' the NCAA Tournament so captivat-

ing — anything and everything

will happen. ' A
With that being said, here are A

my likely—to-be—doomed predic-
tions for the fates of the nine Big
East teams competing in this year’s

I NCAA Tournament:

Syracuse — No. 1 seed, East
Region — TheOrange’s national
championship dreams were dealt a

huge blow this week with the news

that starting center Fab Melo’s ac-
ademic suspension from earlier
this season would be reinstated for
the NCAA Tournament-. Syracuse’s
only regular-season defeat came
during Melo’s original suspension,

‘and there’s no denyingthat the Or-

ange will miss his shot—blocking
defensive presence. Head coach‘
]im'Boeheim’s team still has plenty
of -talent and depth to go deep in
the tournament, but a national title
might now be beyond Syracuse’s
reach. Prediction: Elite Eight loss
to Florida State. 1
Marquette — No. 3 seed, West
Region — Following a surprising
trip to the Sweet Sixteen in last
year’s tournament, the Golden
Eagles believe they have all of the
ingredients in place to produce
similar success this time around.
With an attacking style of play and
a senior-laden backcourt led by

..Darius Johnson—Odom and Big-

 

Steveicfarﬁﬁn (31 I AssistantVisu_al Editor R

Travon Woodall splits two Louisville defenders. The Cardinals are
' la 7in‘ in the NCAA Tournament this week.

East Player of the Yearjae C_rowder,
Marquette enters March Madness

‘somewhat under the radar once

again. A polssiblevsweet Sixteen
match—up with Missouri has the
potential to be one of the best

‘games in this year’s tournament,

Prediction: Sweet Sixteen loss to
Missouri. _ g I 4 -
Georgetown — No. 3 seed, Mid-

west Region -+ The Hoyas’ recent

NCAA Tournament history makes
their future probably the hardest
of all the Big East teams to pre-
dict. Since their trip to‘ the 2007
Final Four, the Hoyas have only
won a single tournament game,

. and they have been knocked out

by lower seeds each year —— includ-
ing a humiliating opening—round

loss to No. 14 seed Ohio in 2010. '

Georgetown will avoid another
ﬁrst game exit this time around,

‘ but it shouldn’t be too long before

the Hoyas are sent home. Predic-
tion: Round of 32 loss to San Diego
State. 1 4

Louisville —— No. 4 seed, West
Region — This year’s Big East
Tournament champions will hope
their momentum carries over to
the Big Dance like it did for Con-
necticut last season. Point guard

Alix Croop: From Pitt”

  toCirque du Soleil

By Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

Alix Croop is a perfectionist._

In gymnastics, that quality
serves her well. But as a member of
the Cirque du Soleil entertainment
company, the former Pitt gymnast
ﬁnds learning to relax a bit of a
challenge. ' '

Croop, who graduated from
Pitt in 2009 with a Psychology de-
gree,is now living in Las Vegas, 15
minutes west of the strip withtwo
members of the Cirque du Soleil
cast. For the 24-year-old, changing
her attitude about performance has
been a challenge.

“My coaches here told me you
kind of have to get away from the

' gymnastics-type me-ntality,”.Croop

said. “You’re not performing for
a score, you’re

tainment world, has seen Croop
grow from her early days at Pi‘t't‘(”
into the professionalshe is now.
“From the day we got her, we

realized that Alix was a rare breed,”
‘Rowe said. “Very passionate, dedi-

' cated, determined, committed to

the sport.”

When Croop decided she
wanted to give Cirque du Soleil a
shot, Rowe was the perfect person
to Consult. He had spent time in-
volved in theater and performance,
so he felt he could help Croop train
for her audition. Finding time ii;
Croop’s schedule proved difficult.

“We came into the gym two or
three times a week at 8 o’clock in

' the morning for a couple months,”

Rowe remembered. “She. was jug-
gling work, school, her internship
and all this stuff and at the same
time, still found time tocome to do

work at eight in

performing to
entertain these
people. I have
to relax a little
bit more when

“You’re
  ' worker, Croop

quite a chal- . i “Alix was
lengeforme so   a role model,
far.” A ‘ a supporter,
Pitt gym- * a person kids

nastics coach Debbie Yohman re-
members Croop for always wanting
to please her coaches and always
trying to get better. '

“She was also a perfectionist

and very hard on herself,” Yohman ‘

said. “A lot of the time we spent

telling her to take a little bit easier .

on hersel .” .

When she was competing for ' '

the University of Pittsburgh,
Croop was a top talent. During.
her senior year,’ she was the East
Atlantic Gymnastics League bar
champion, qualiﬁed individually to
regionals in all three of her events

— (bars, beams and ﬂoor) and tallied

a career-high 9.9 score on'Senior
Night. I A .

‘‘She was one of those almost
obsessively’ compelled athletes that
ate, dreamed and breathed gym-
nastics,” -Pitt gymnastics coach
Mike Rowe said. “When she wasn’t
in the gym, she was on YouTube
looking at routines.”

Rowe, who played a major role
in Croop’s transition to the enter-

would go to when they were down,”
Yohman said. “I think from the day

. she started here she was just some— _

body everyone looked up to and
ad_mired.” ._. 

It wasn’t always easy for Croop,
either. After sufferinga knee injury
her freshman year, Croop fought
an uphill battle. ,

“She was a natural leader,” Rowe
said. “Al is a person that is going to

talk about goals and aspiratioriisﬂ

about the team, and like I said, she
wants to follow through until the
end. It wasn’t really a transition
for her into being a leader, it was
natural.” V
While not all gymnasts go intea

the performing arts, Yohman says
that Croop had a quality that made

"her special. .

“One of the things that made
Alix stand out was that she was just
so elegant,” Yohman said. “She hag“
these gorgeous lines and she was“:

i just pretty to watch. The kind of

things you think of when you think
of Cirque du Soleil.” I

The men’s and women’s track andﬁeld

honors from the NCAA championship and

H’. shattered several long-standing Pitt and

_ The men’s team placed third overall in
the Big East Tournament in late February,
which featured a record—breaking perfor-
mancejby sophomore Brycen Spratling in

by setting the fastest time not only in the
American collegiate category, but also in
the world, at 1:O0.63._ ‘ ‘

performance in the Big East tournament.
We ﬁnished eighth.or ninth the year before,

so it was a big improvement,” head coach_

Alonzo Webb said. .

“Typically, we train four days a week and

  said. “We’re leaving for North Carolina for

 gs‘ Webb cites the team’s lack of an outdoor

facility" in which to host meets as arcad-
block to competition and a major reason
the team must travel so much.

_ “We’re on the road a lot. It makes it tough
on the kids, but they’ve been pretty resil-

ient. It‘ is way different than most "schools '

with facilities that don’t have to travel every
weekend,” he said. .

have seven All—Americans this season. That

is the most All—Americans in the historyof ‘

Pitt on the men’s side, and we wantto try
