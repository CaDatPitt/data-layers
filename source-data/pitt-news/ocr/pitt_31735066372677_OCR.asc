Moral Majority’s
Motives Debated

By MARGARET ATTWOOD
Birch Bayh, former,U.S_. Senator
and Cal Thomas, national spokes-
man for the Moral Majority,
debated issues of abortion, defense,
religion, the misrepresentations of
liberals and religious fundamen-
talists, last night at 8:00 in the
David LawrenceAuditorium.
Thomas opened his address by

. saying that although he and -Bayh

disagree «politically, they don’t
necessarily have to dislike each
other personally. _ -
“I have great admiration for
Birch Bayh,” Thomas said. “He
has led a dedicated ‘life, unfortu-
nately he was wrongmosat of the
time.” V S _

. Thomas claimedthat the Moral
Majority has beengreatly misre-
presented. by the liberals. The real
intentions of the Moral Majority

and its founder Jerry Falwell are to-

address the excesses of government
which has regressed from “in God
we trust” to “We trust in the State.”

He said the Moral Majority
“people are those who in the past

‘ have been politically apathetic, but

who perceive a change in values
that is undermining the country.”

The modern understanding,
according to Thomas, of the sepa-
ration of church and state but not
in separating church from the
state. He claims that-the founding
fathers by stating that we have cer-
tain inalienable rights, understood

Speaker
Chosen

By N_\lKE MALLINGER

Phillip Hauge Abelson,
physical chemist and editor of
Science Magazine, has -been
chosen as the speaker for Pitt's
Honors Convocation. ,

He will deliver the keynote
address at the honors ceremony
to be held March 10 at 3 p.m. in
Carnegie Music Hall. ‘

Abelson has received special
recognition for outstanding ser-
vice by the Navy, Mellon Insti-
tute, UNESCO and the
American Medical Association.
He holds honorary degrees
from Yale, Southern Methodist,
Tufts and Puget Sound univer-
sities.

was founded upon Christian-
Judaic thinking.

“We suffer under aflawed read- .

ing of the First Amendment and
religious freedom is not what mod-
ern judges believe it to be,” Tho-

~~ mas said. .

According to Thomas, the Moral
Majority is exercising its right to
speak out. ‘ . -

"We have no right’ to impose our
views on everyone else, but the lib-
erals cpass laws and force us to
adhere to their
explained. “Murder, stealing and
rape are all moral issues but the
people who do these things say
their rights have been abridged.
Laws promote general welfare.

“All law imposes one person’s ‘
morality upon another. We believe “

that the Christian-Judaic morality
base has the best track recordfor
governing a nation.” ~

“People say we are arrogant,”
said Thomas. “We are standing on
principles. One man’s arrogance is
another man’s steadfastness. I’d
rather be right and arrogant than
wishy-washy.” - ,

Thomas denied that the Moral

Students can’t escape the effects

_ of Reaganomics. The administra-

tion's cutbacks on higher educa-
tion funding have already reduced
the amount of student aid availa-
ble, and according to Pitt’s Student
Aid Office, obtaining loans and

grants will be even more difficult-'

for the 1982-83 school year.
“Depending on when applica-

tions were filed for this year, some

students may have already felt the
consequences of the first wave of
cuts, which went into effect last
October,” said Suzanne McCul-
loch, associate director of student
aid at Pitt. “Whatever the case,
everyone will be affected by them
next year." A

In addition to last year’s cuts,
some programs face more restric-
tions next year.

The maximum amount of aid
available through Pell grants,
which were formerly known as
Basic Education Opportunity
Grants, was cut from $1,750 to

PHEAA grants through the state
Student Incentive Grant program
was reduced by 5 percent last fall,
and may be totally eliminated next
year, according to McCulloch.
This would make PHEAA grants
more difficult to acquire and

would lower the maximum grant

available, she said.

Funding for a third type of grant,
Supplemental Education Oppor-
tunity Grants (SEOG), was cut by
40 percent last fall. It is unclear at
this point if the federal government
will place greater restrictions on
the SEOG program, but the effects
of last year’s cut will be felt next
fall, McCulloch noted.

Student loans have also been
affected by budget trimming.
Funding for National Direct Stu-
dent Loans (NDSL) was reduced by
$100 million last year. No new cuts
are forecast for next fall, but the
effects of the original reduction
will make NDSLS much harder to
obtain for the I982-83 school year.

A major topic at Pitiithat has
received vastamounts of ink lately
has been faculty involvement in
university decision-making.

In light of curriculum reform,
the merging of the American Asso-
ciation of University Professors
(AAUP) with the Pitt Professional

Union (PPU) to forming United‘

Faculty, and shrinking state aid,
the university will be faced with a
need to adapt to changing times.

Differing opinions exist
throughout the university on the
degree to which faculty involve-
ment currently exists, and how
much it should exist in the future.
In” view of this, The Pitt News
asked several, faculty members to
offer their opinions.

5 There Enough Faculty Participation

Philip Wion

United Faculty Co-Chairman

Cronau Photo

Dr. Philip Wion, an English
professor and co—chairman of the
newly formed United Faculty (the
other chairman being Richard
Thorn) said that some faculty

 ./(“Ky /‘jg /\’ \.\'

members feel “fragmented”
because their attempt to influence
tlecision-making is sometimes
neglected.

“I can remember a time not long
ago when there was a huge turnout
for senate meetings, but this. is not
as evident now,” Wion said. “A lot
of faculty began to feel that the
senate and other bodies, because of
their advisory status, did not have
influence on important decisions.”

When asked how to increase
faculty involvement in decision-
making, Wion said the answer is
collective bargaining. ~

“Under collective bargaining, a
high degree of facultyiinfluence
will be seen because an organiza-
tion like United Faculty has more
leverage,” Wion said. “Collective
bargaining can also strengthen the
University Senate and other bodies.
The vehicle for leverage is a written
contract.”

Wion said he is optimistic
because “hopefully” United
Faculty will gain collective bar-
gaining rights and thusincrease
and reinforce faculty interest and
involvement. '

Dr. Wilfried Daehnick, a physics

awareness is weak because a “lack
of communication exists.”

“A special topic interesting to
many faculty members will bring
about large attendance, but faculty
attendance at University Senate
meetings is consistently low,”
Daehnick said. "The Senate has
approximately 2,000 members, and
yet sometimes less than 100 show
up.” . v
Daehnick does not believe the
senate represents a strong faculty
voice, but he said this is partly due
to faculty pressu_res of time and
other obligations.

“If the attendance at senate meet-
ings is very low, this may only
mean the faculty is not worried
about anything,” Daehnick said.

“But the danger is when things are ,

perceived as being wrong. Enough
faculty should be concerned all the
time so as to prevent any future
troubles."

‘According to Daehnick, the
senate is at present discussing reor-

ganization. _ I
“I often find people who say we

as faculty have no power, but I do
not agree. If the faculty speaks with
a clear voice, the actions of the
administration will be influenced.
For example, faculty initiated early
retirement and medical insurance
plans. Every time an individual
speaks up, the administration can't
always act,” Daehnick concluded.

Bayh, Thomas Debate Moral Majority Stands

continued from page one

graphy and we are called censors.”

Thomas. described the Moral

Majority platform as being:’ pro-
life, 'i.e. opposed to’ homosexual
lifestyles, pro-morality, and pro-
America.
, “‘One _thing is worse-than war-
silence,” said Thomas. “We may
not always ‘be right, but we are not
guilty of being silent.”

In his rebuttal Birch Bayh said
people need to look at the real
world and not simply a philoso-
phical ideal. '

“When I gave my first speech on
the implications of the political
right,” Bayh said, “I had to first
take a deep look at my own motiva-

' tions. I» was targeted by the Moral

Majority and had to be sure that I
could be totally objective in my
assessment.

f‘I love our democratic institu-
tion and democracy. The Moral
Majority has a right to speak out
and I appreciate that right. I wish
the whole spectrum ‘of ‘Christen-
dom would speak out more.”

According to Bayh, the Moral
Majority believes that they have
changed the complexion of the
U,S. Senate.

"The ave-rage congressman
thinks he is 10 feet tall,” Bayh
explained. “It is important that the
president and congress not feel they
have to make inordinate conces-
sions to the Moral Majority. They
do not have the power they claim,
but if they are perceived as having
it, the effect is the same.

“It’s important to put this myth
to bed.”

Goldwater, said Bayh, believes

the Moral Majority is more like a
fascist group than a conservative
one.

“I’m speaking out against them
because some of their ideas are so
way—out that they threaten demo-
cratic institutions,” Bayh said.

Bayh claimed that the Moral .

Majority practices gutter politics
and the average citizen doesn’t like
their tactics. He also claimed that
Falwell and others appointed
themselves the Moral Majority and
that they neither represent moral-
ity nor the majority.

“People look at them and say, ‘if
it walks like a duck, quacks like a
duck and has feathers like a duck,
then it must be aduck’,” Bayh said.

“I’m concerned about people
who say they speak for God. If you
don't follow me you know where
you’ll end up.

“I don’t know what God-looks
like, but I don’t think he or she has
a right or left wing political per-
suasion. I believe there's room for
all at the Pearlv Gates.”

Bayh spoke of his own religious
experiences, calling himself a
Born Again Christian. “I hear little
from the political right that con-
veys the kind of Christianity that I
grew up with,” he said. “I see little
of the love, charity, and attitude of
the Good Samaritan. I’m uncom-
fortable with their brand of Chris-
tianity."

During the 1980 election, Bayh
claims that the Moral Majority
passd out literature from pulpits
and went door to door, claiming
that he fostered homosexuality and
favored experimentation on live

, aborted fetuses.

“Tolerance distinguishes this

country from others. They say they
believe in the family, in morality
and in God.” Bayh said before pos-
ing questions to the audience.
“Does that mean I don't? Is it possi-
ble for one group of people to take

Have you wasted time interviewing with companies that came to your
campus with no intention of hiring —— companies that sent rejection
letters to everyone they talked to, or maybe even cancelled the interview
the day before it was scheduled?

We don’t think it’s fair. That's why the Equipment Group of Texas

Instruments wouldn't offer interviews unless we had something else to
offer, too -— CAREERS. We're as serious about hiring as you are about
getting started in the business world.

We’re looking for engineers and computer science graduates to work on

too? That intolerance is danger-

Bayh also added that the fact
Evangelist Billy Graham has
expressed concern over what's

going on with the Moral Majority
has caused him great concern.
“Where was Falwell when blacks
couldn't vote, and couldn't buy
housing?" Bayh asked. “Was this

not a moral issue? And yet they say

we are immoral."

Council passed a resolution cal-

committee to participate in the
selection of speakers for the
Honors Convocation and

Steps for the actual formation

The controversy arose

major role in the selection

narrowed, through personal
interviews, the list of possible
convocation speakers down to
eight names. _ 5.

At the committee's last meet-

ing on Jan. 22 a list of possibili-

ties for commencement speaker
possibilities was compiled and
submitted to the chancellor,
committee-
member Professor Richard
Pratt.
At the next committee meet-
ing, Pratt said he hopes the
committee will formalize and
put in writing the selection pro-

cess, continue to solicit com-

ments from the various sectors
of the university on the final
choices, and decide how the
committee itself should be
designated.

“At this point the committee
is ambiguous,” Pratt” ex-
plained.“It does not fall under
the heading of the Senate Coun-
cil or that of any other
organization.”

SGBMembers Tour Student

By LAURIE MacI.EOD

Several Student Government
Board (SGB) members who
toured Pitt’s Student Health
Service (SHS) Tuesday said
limited space is a major prob-
lem of the service.

Board members Robbie The’,
Rebecca Veronis, Chip Roth

and Greg Powers along with

Franklyn Carter, chairman of
SHS, toured the health service.

The purpose of the SHS tour
was to get an idea of procedures
and problems so ‘the SGB can
compile a survey for students.

This survey will reflect the
students’ attitudes toward the
SHS.

Robbie The’, the liaison to
vice chancellor for health scien-
ces, said the membes were
shown -the limited space in the
Wellness Resource Center,
located in Holland Hall, and

The Wellness Resource Cen-
ter offers first aid training for
Peer Medical Aide Program
(PMAP) students and holds
group counseling sessions.

“Space is crucial to them, and
any counseling or training is
done- in a small area,” The’
said.

The clinical area is also
pressed for space according to
The’.

He said there are small corri— -

dors and examination rooms.
Student records are kept in a
confined area, and only one per-
son has access at a time.

The’ stressed the need for
space and said the conditions
were “not conducive to practi-
cal work.” _

Franklyn Carter

said the

more space because there is not

enough storage or examination
rooms, and the people are work-
ing too closely.

The health service is in the
process of trying to attain more
space but not as rapidly as Car-
ter would like.

Carter said he requested addi-
tional space from the univer-
sity, but he has not received a
reply to that request.

SGB member Chip Roth said
he believed the SHS was work-
_ing efficiently with the space

provided.

Roth was concerned with
SHS budgets and seeing that
student health fees were not
wasted.

Carter said students are get-
ting the best deal for their
“health dollar.”

The’ felt it ironic that SHS is
under the direction of Dr. Con-
ney Kimbo, chancellor for stu-
dent affairs, rather than Nathan
Stark, chancellor for health
sciences.

The’ said that is what people
in the health sciences were
trained for.

“This way we could get
proper administration, direc-
tion and budgeting," he said.

Kimbo told The’ that Student
Affairs directs the program
because it deals with students.

The’ said the members were
unable to ask staff and patients
questions on the tour so many
issues were left unanswered.

Cutbacks Hurt Students

continued from page one

Ioans won’t necessarily be guaran-
teed any more. Though formerly
available to all students, families
whose income exceeds $30,000
must now demonstrate financial
need to obtain the loans.

McCulloch explained that

“financial need" is determined by
family size and the number of stu-
dents a family has in college. By
next year, the financial-need res-
triction may be extended to" all
applicants regardless of family

income. ,
If it’s any consolation, the work-

study program hasn’t seen any sig- ,

nificant cutbacks in the past year,
and no work-study cuts are forecast
for thecoming year.

\

Doctoring Med
School Facts

We were happy to read in yesterday’s University Timesa
‘story reporting that Pitt’s School of Medicine, according
to Dean Donald Leon, was “a ‘healthy’ program despite
some outside constraints." . ’

This assessment, the Times story says, is part of a pro-
gress report to the Liason Committee on Medical Educa-

. tion (LCME), which had asked the medical school to
prepare the report as part of the requirement for maintain-
ing its accreditation into 1984. _

Dean Leon, it is remembered from last term, has had his
share of problems in reporting the status of the medical
school in so-called confidential reports, notably the one he
prepared for Gov. Dick Thornburgh last September. So it ‘
comes as a welcome relief that the dean was cordial

in enough to let the university community in on the sub-
stance of this report. ‘ I n ' _

But we have to admit that we have some problems in
believing what the dean says anymore‘, both in print and in
conversation, given the fact he seems to reserve his most
critical judgement of the medical school for private and
confidential reports.

The same goes for Chancellor Wesley Posvar who has
been known to paint glowing pictures of the status of the
medical school-—only to have those statements later
refuted by the actual facts. ‘

Witness this statement made by Posvar at a July 12
Senate Council meeting: “We can refute each and every
negative comment made about the School of Medicine.
The rpost important. problem confronting the school is
not money,” Compare —Posvar’s story with this statement
made by Dean Leon in his report to Gov. Thornburgh: “If
the problems of academic space, budget and tuition are
not solved promptly, the school’s accreditation status will

' be at risk and a major Commonwealth resource will be ~
jeopardized.” . I ‘

Who’s to be believed here, the dean or the chancellor? It
would be nice to think that within the academic world-
problems such as departmental communications and

' other intangibles outweighed the medical school’s deficit
of $2.8 million for this year and tuition rates that are the‘
highest in the country for public medical schools. '

Unfortunately for Chancellor Posvar, who, as the head
of a university with an operating budget larger than that

' of the city of Pittsburgh, should know better than to make
statements like that, tenuous finances in the medical
school are a greater cause for alarm than communications
problems. v ‘ —

Farther along in the Times article,.we read according to
Dean Leon, that the progress report's section on finances
“paints a picture, conservatively, of the school’soptimism

' for solid funding.” ‘

Well, that's certainly nice to know.nThat is if you can
believe it. Once again, however, we’d have to have a hard
time swallowing that statement. I V ~-

After all, wasn’t this the same dean who, in a June 17
letter to the editorpublished in The Pitt News, wrote as a
criticism of a previous letter by Dr. Robert Glew:

“Professor Glew further asserts that tuition levelsof
$13,000 per year per student for next year are being consi-
dered. This statement is quite without foundation. . .The
planning guidance for next year’s tuition. . .does not
approach the figure alleged by Professor Glew.”

If the dean isn’t already aware of it. tuition for out-of-
state freshmen in the medical school is $13,350 for the
current year. Come now dean, who’s kidding whom here?

All the previous statements are listed simply as evidence
that both Dean Leon and the chancellor have not always
been up front in reporting—-publicly—the status of the \
medical school. It is for this « reason that we hope the
university, and the LCME, digs a little deeper than the
dean and the chancellor for accurate information on the
medical school- - '

Dear Editor: 1

As a‘ former concert chairperson
at Alfred University, a small four-
year liberal arts school in central
New York state, your article on the
lack of major concerts at Pitt (Jan.
25, “Why Aren't There Major Con-
certs at Pitt?”) has prompted me to
write. Based upon my experience

, in the fields of concerts, albeit a

number of years ago, I find the
answers given by Pitt Program-
ming Committee (PPC) personnel
slightly short of incredulous. For
example; Ed Kelly states that the
university lost a “substantial”
amount of money when they
booked the Atlanta Rhythm Sec-
tion and Pablo Cruise. Back in
1976-77, the Atlanta Rhythm Sec-
tion and Pablo Cruise were inex-

. pensive to book at $9500 plus lights

and sound and $3500 plus lights
and sound respectively. Even with
inflation, the amount of money
spent for these two groups could
not have strained the concert com-

‘ Vmittee resources.

Speaking of concert committee
resources, I for one would like to

Where Do the Trolleys if  

BY I'M KEAR.N.EY

In his memoir, The Oak and the
Cal], Alexander Solzhenitsyn
recalls a conversation with his edi-
tor at Novy Mir, the journal in
which his few published works in
the U.S.S.R. appeared. The editor,
poet, party member and Central
Committee member Alexander
Tvardovsky used the phrase “Do
you think I would get on a trolley

without a token?” Solzhenitsyn ‘

recalls thinking at the time that
Tvardovsky must have learned the
phrase at a “party cliche’ work-
shop”, to keep the literary-world
party members up on the expres-
sions the commoners were using.
He doubted if Tvardovsky even
knew ‘where the trolleys stopped.
Whenever I hear Ronald Reagan
or one of his administration
members mentioning their safety
nets or their concerns for the poor, I
can't help but think of Solzhenit-
syn’s comments. I have a sneaking
suspicion that Reagan and his men
really believe what they’re saying,
just as they think the populace’s
complaints are magnified by a lib-
eral press that only wants to take
potshots at them. It is their view
that people hve grown too accus-
tomed to governmental transfer
paymentsiand other services, and
the cries are cries of discomfort and
not of pain. When the president
said that if people would look in
their papers thy would finds lots of
advertisements for jobs, it is hard to
believe that he has any inkling
what the unemployed are up
against. Recently on the news,
there were reports of 2,000 appli-
cants for 300 jobs in one city, and
an astounding 4,000 applicants for

   

Concert Programming ‘lncredulous’

know exactly how much money the
concert committee was ‘allocated
for this year. How much was spent
to book the two groups I have men-
tioned? How much to rent the Syria
Mosque? How.much for lights and
sound for the two groups? How
much money was actually “lost" in
producing this concert?

As for Kelly's other comment
about “agency and promoter heat”
preventing advertisement of the
concert, what evidence does he
have of a conspiracy to prevent this
concert? In my experience as a con-
cert chairperson, I had to vie for
groups and ad spaces in both the
Rochester and Buffalo, N.Y.
markets. At no time did I find less
than total support for whatever
concerts I was holding. Agencies
that represent groups, especially
ones that have not had a hit in a
long time like the Atlanta Rhythm
Section. and Pablo Cruise, welcome a
with open arms the opportunity
for their groups to be heard. Prom-
oters such as DiCesare-Engler

. could care less about a concert such

as one of this stature. Perhaps one

 

invisible hand of the market and
the spirit of voluntarism in their
most naked forms. Can the presi-
dent really think that people would
stand in below-freezing tempera-

tures for five pounds of cheese just,

to get a handout? Are he and those
who advise him so cynical to
believe that it is a snow-job orches-
trated by the Democrats?

On the other hand, I believe that
Reagan was given a mandate to cut
such programs and balance the
budget. I believe that when he
spoke of cutting the budget, the less
fortunate, working-class people
thought he would purge excess
bureaucracy, welfare cheaters,and
remove from the books bothersome
and unnecessary regulations. What
they didn’t expect was a wholesale,
clean sweep of virtually all pro-
grams. I

Student aid, OSHA and entire
departments are being swept away.
The voters who turned to Reagan
to save our morals. to ban busing

88 jobs in a second, The soup kt- an aortion, an to reinstate pray-
’ chens that are springing up all over

our nation are evidence of the"

of the reasons for 3,000 students
attending this concert rather than
13,000 was that bot.h of these

groups are considered, as they were

in 1976-77, to-be “over the hill.’T
Let me close by pointing out a
few facts of the concert profession.

First, good concerts are only pro- .

duced when there is consumer

- want forthe artists booked, there is

a diversity of artists ‘booked and
there is an organized media cam-
paign for the concert. Second, you

are never going to attractan artist

such as Bruce Springsteen with the
resources that you have available.
Nor should you try. Instead, leave

concerts of this size to a DiCesare- ‘

Engler. Concentrate instead ‘on
national groups that are up-and-
coming or are one step below “the
big time.” Good concerts can be
produced that will not only satisfy
the student body, but also allow a
concert committee to at least break
even, if not turn a profit. Tshould
know, I used to manage to do so on

a budget of only $12,000 per year. ,

ers and their various interpreta-

‘ tions of God into our lives didn’t

expect to be “put on the back-
burner” either. ‘They all liked this
charming man, and they turned
their trust into votes.

I am, as are most students, one of
the fortunate ones. I work, I

attend school and I’ve got at least ,

some control over my future. But at
times I feel some resentment. When
I hear of employment offices being
closed, for example, when I read of
the Reagans’ flying in chili from
Los Angeles especially for a party,
or when I read of policies that I feel
only alienate the people not “in”

the inner circle. Yet, I’m not in .

such a bad predicament—but do
those 4,000 unemployed persons
standing in that line for work feel?

It seems hard to ruin the econ-
omy of a nation so large and strong

The Pitt News, Friday, January 29, 1982

-—Page 9

Dear Editor: .
When agreeing to talk to your
M correspondent, Seth Lubove, about
‘t- my tenure process, I was hoping
that my particular experience
could expose some of the basic
weaknesses in the tenure process. It
could thus become a springboard
for at least discussion and possibly
even reform of the tenure system as
it operates at the University of
Pittsburgh. And it is in that spirit
that I am writing in response to the
original article and to the subse-
quent editorial that appeared in
The Pitt News.
I am grateful to Lubove for so
thoroughly digesting and report-

”,.i,ng the interview that I gave to

r‘-

I nlim. However, I had hoped that-he
would personally interview some
of the students whose names I gave
him, so that the article would not

reflect only my views but also the ‘

student opinion of my teaching
and service to the university. I was
also disappointed that he found me

to be bitter about the reasons for —

denying me tenure. I have found
bitterness to be a destructive atti-
tude to project towards any diffi-
culty, and I consider myself to be
creatively reacting to a situation
that may possibly bring more diffi-
culty to the university and the
music department thanto myself.
, I am happy that the]an.20 edito-
K ‘E » ,.
?«t:-,;§~I,(“Tenuos Tenure ) places my
tenure difficulties_within the con-
text of previous tenure decisions at
Pitt, indicating that this particular
situation is not racial or overtly
political. As a result, it more blat-
antly exposes the real weakness of
the tenure process. I note that you
suggest I might have more effec-
tively fought the tenure process
during tenure decisions other than

. 35

my own. I do not believe that I
could have viably fought the pro-_

. cess until I had obtained tenure and
become a part of the tenures

“elite.” In other words, short of

some type of concerted movement,

I do not feel thatl, as a single indi-
vidual, could have had significant
influence upon the system before I
was a part of it. -

What are the

issues I had

' intended to fight but did not have

an oppurtunity to do so, but which,

L my case has exposed? The first and

most obvious issue is the extreme
emphasis that Pitt places upon
research. I was not a typical
publish-or-perish case. I had 31
publications to my credit. I do not

. know the magic number that Pitt

requires, but clearly some of my
critics expected more, and they
would have been more than satis-
fied had one of these publications
been a book. . _

In any case it is clear that if I had
not published enough, then this
aspect of tenure evaluation has
been awarded ridiculous impor-
tance. Truly, any great university
needs research and publication,
but should this be the primary cri-
terion for evaluation? And is it not

l

possible for some to be better at
research and others to better at
teaching? I was probably not Pitt's
best teacher, but all of my students
would admit that I was a good
teacher and that I spent a great por-
tion of my timein working with
students and in helping them to
learn and achieve their goals.
Related to my teaching accom-
plishments were my curricular,
administrative and program con-
tributions to my department and
the university. Is there no way at
Pitt or at any.university for the
pluses of a person’s performance. to
outweigh the minuses?

The second major issue is in the
evaluation proess. In my particular
case, some Pitt professors found the
quality of my scholarship to be
inadequate, but a broad consensus
of my national and international
colleagues were unanimous in
refuting the criticisms of the Pitt
evaluators. In fact, some of the out-
side evaluators were shocked at the
ignorance and lack of knowledge
that the Pitt evaluations revealed.

But the appeals panel felt that the _.

outside evaluations were not of suf-
ficient weight to merit a re-
examination of the case. Can

     

quahty ever be built upon institu-

tional arrogance ‘that ignores
knowledgeable outside opinion?
Perhaps the interdepartmental
review committees should review
opinions rather than exercise their
own opinions, which may be
biased by the nature of their partic-
ular disciplines.
I am also convinced that the eval-
uation process ignored informed
student opinion. Nine students
very emphatically testified to the
appeals panels that my teaching
was outstanding, and yet that
panel reported that the dean’s orig-
inal disparaging report of my
teaching was not inaccurate. Was
the appeals panel so steeped in the
existing tenure system or were they
coerced by the dean to not recco-
. mend that a new review process be
initiated in my case? I am con-
vinced that the evaluation process
was inadequate in my case, and I
assume that this could also be true
in other cases. It appears that more
emphasis should be given to

departmental, national and stu-
dent opinions. ,
And finally, I seriously questio
whether the “either-orness” of the
present system is in the best intersts

Mouth

of either the university or the “yic-
tims” of the tenure process.
Tenure, at its best, makes it possi-
ble for a university to preserve,
promote and protect the best of
professorial talent. It also gives

quality professors security in the

face of possible mercurial adminis-
trative decisions and academic free-
dom to pursue their careers in the
way that they feel will best serve the
university and society. However,
the university would benefit from a
more flexible application of the
tenure process. Why must all pro-
fessors either get tenure or be fired?
Is there not room for more non-
tenured appointments? Is it not

‘possible for a professor who has

made a greatr contribution to the
university but who does not merit
tenure to bo offered a non-tenured
appointment? The ‘university
would then not get locked into a
situation where a department has
too many tenured professors, and
non-tenured professors would be
relieved from the extreme pressure
that they must either publish
according to certain criteria or per-
ish. Tenure would thus become a
reward for meritorious service. -

It seems to me that these and
other tenure-related issues should
be actively debated. If the publicity
generated by my negative tenure
decision can focus upon these
issues, then perhaps there is /still
some redeeming quality that this

situation can contribute to the pro-

cess of academic viability and
justice.

Important Pitt
Facility

Dear Editor:

I am writing in response to
Cindy McDovell’s letterrof the Jan.
6 edition of The Pitt News. The
writer made several valid points in
her letter about the needs of “differ-
ent” University of Pittsburgh stu-
dents. However, your editing staff
made quite ,a blunder in its choice
of a title for the letter——-“Pitt Needs '
Day Care Center."

The Campus Nursery Center is a
licensed nursery school/day-care
center facility that has been located
on Pitt’s campus for 11 years! We
serve 30 preschool children and are
open from 8:00 a.m. until 5:30 p.m.
daily. In addition, we train gradu-
ate students and student teachers

from the university. \
D As the campus’ main-newspaper,
it is your responsibility to know

Pitt- wvu: ARunnin g Feud

By AMIN GHOSSEIN‘

' Don’t be surprised if the West
Virginia Mountaineers forego the
bus trip to Pittsburgh, andjust run
to the Field. House for tonight’s 7

ii p.m. shootout with Pitt at the Field

House.'You see, running is what
the Mountaineers do best,‘ and do
often. ‘ t
Actually, running is all WVU
does. It’s worked pretty well so far
considering West "Virginia is a
gaudy 15-1 and ‘has their state
enthralled with basketball—and
why not? '
When WVU head coach Gale
Catlett was looking over his team
before the season began, he must
have envisioned The Machine. The
Machine is his basketball team
which consists of eight players of
equal ability, and effectiveness.
With such a veteran casttand a
dynamo in Greg Jones, the blue-
print for success must have lit up in
Catlett’s mind: Pressure, fastbrea-k
and win.

By SEAN BARNES

A matchup between the West
Virginia Mountaineers and the Pitt
Panthers always brings the roof
down, and this season’s men's
swim meet will be no exception.
West Virginiaand Pitt have been
dreaming all season long of tomor-
row’s high-energy meet in Mor-
gantown, which will pit old rivals
against each other in every event.

Looking at the current Eastern
rankings, it appears the meet
should go to the Mountaineers, but
one must look deeper. Most of West
Virginia's fastest times this season
came from its meet with Penn
State. The West Virginia team
shaved and went for broke when
they hit the water against the Nit-
tany Lions. ‘

Pitt (loach Fred Lewis, converse-
ly, stuck to his originalseason plan
and won’t have the Panther team

Attention! .

Tonight’s Pitt-WVU game
will start at 7 p.m. not at 8
p.m. as originally sched-
uled. With a huge crowd
expected, students are
advised to get to the Field
House early to ensure get-
ting a good seat.

WVU boasts wins over Ohio

State, Virginia Tech, and a perfect ,

record (5-0) in the Eastern 8. The
only blemish was an early season
loss to Marshall. So good have the
Mountaineers’ fortunes been that
Catlett has changed his mind about

shave until Easterns.

Even comparing W.VU's shaved
times against Pitt"s regular times,
Pitt is only off by an average .25
seconds per lap. So even if WVU
shaves for tomorrow’s meet, they’re
going to have their hands full.
Also, if the team does shave, to
know they must then shave down
again for Easterns could destroy its
psychological advantage.

WVU, even with its deep lineup,
can't touch Pitt’s Sandy Pidgeon in
the breaststroke, nor Ed Bergan in

A the backstroke. But along the same

line, Pitt shouldn't touch WVU in
the butterfly or diving events. The
entire meet will be a very hotly-
contested battle with the winner
emerging as the favored team to
win Easterns. ‘

Lewis and his swimmers are
psyched for a good showing, and a
good showing will be necessary to
impress the many recruits that will

leaving the Eastern 8. {Why leave

something that offers its champion-

an automatic NCAA tourney berth,
especially with Pitt bolting to the
Big East? Just call it West Virginia
and the Eastern 6 next year, Catlett‘
must figure.

It’s been no fluke that West Vir-
ginia is 15-1. With the super-
talented Jones (15.1 ppg) running
the fastbreak, and super-beefy Phil
Collins clearing the boards, the
Mountaineers are the league’s top
scoring team at 79*points a game,
and the league’s best rebounding
team with a 39.9 per game average.

Noiwonder their fastbreak is so
effective. With Russell Todd (6;-1
rebounds a game), Collin-s, and

backup center Donnie Gipson pul- E

ling the rebounds down, Jones and
company can just start running.

When they're not fastbreaking,.

own pool would be a potential sell-
ing point.

Pitt’s diving coach Julian Krug
and his diver Rex Nordheimer will
face two of the East’s‘best divers,
but diving is an event judged, not
clocked. An excellent showing by
Nordheimer, and a missed dive by
West Virginia could turn the div-
ing event around.

The West Virginia grandstands
will be packed, the crowd noisy,
and the times brisk at tomorrow’s
meet, a meet that will bring the
winners a euphoria only. true
champions understand, and plant
a seed of revenge in the losers that
will make Easterns a mean two-
team meet.

WVU will have the home advan-
tage for this contest, but the tables
will be turned when Pitt hosts the
Eastern Regionals on March 4-6 at
the Trees Hall Pool.

they start running, well, whatfs
that song Don Meredith sings late
Mondaynight? You get the point.

Funny thing though, Pitt head
coach Roy Chipman is not only left
unawed by the Mountaineers, he is
also unafraid of running with
them;

“We'll run with them. Not thatl
want toget into running game, but
we can run with them,” Chipman
matter-of-factly said. '

Chipman’s boldness could be
founded on the fact that West Vir-
ginia’s strength—its ‘guards — is
also his team's, strong suit. In
Dwayne Wallace, George’ Allen,
Darrell Gissendanner and Billy
Culbertson, Chipman has four
guards who can handle the basket-
ball adeptly and run too.‘

Men’s Invite
Draws East
Track Elite

By BARRY ZASLOFF

Twenty Eastern schools, includ-
ing Pitt, will participate in the 13th
annual Pitt Indoor Track Invita-
tional tomorrow and Sunday at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

Pitt assistant coach and meet
director Mel Boyd labeled the
upcoming meet "one of the best in
the east. Any time this many
schools get together, it has to be
a quality meet.” . .

Among the participants, Boyd-
expects Pitt, Eastern Kentucky,
East Tennessee, and Delaware
State to be the strongest. Although
team scores won’t be kept, runners

will compete to qualify for

NCAA Nationals March 13-14’ "
the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich.
Boyd is hopeful that several '

Panthers can qualify, calling this
year's Pitt squad “the best team I’ve
seen here in 10 years.”

Garland Brown, Greg Conover,‘

Terry Gallagher, and Darren
Geary, otherwise known as Pitt’s
2-mile relay team, have already
qualified for Nationals with a
nation-best time of 7:27.7 at East-
ern Tennessee a few weeks back. In
the invitational, each will try to
qualify in the open 800-meter
event.

Of other interest will be the per-
formance of Roger Kingdom, a
freshman running back for the Pi;
football team who will run the Bl)-
yard high hurdles. Kingdom was a
Georgia State decathalon champ in
high school, but he just began
practicing with the track team last
week. ‘

In other events, Rick Asbérry, an
ex-Pitt football player, runs the 50-
yard dash, Brian Pollack the 440-
yard dash, Mario Joyner and
Dwayne Defoor the 600-yard dash
and Todd Colas and Greg Conover
the 1000-yard dash.

Among the visiting individual
standouts are Ken Glover from
Eastern Kentucky, who boasts a 7-4-
in the high jump and Ian Dailey of
Maryland-East Shore, A who . 3
already easily eclipsed the l:l0  
necessary to qualify for the Nation-
als in the 600-yard dash. Dailey has

already run a_1 :09 time this year.

Lewis

--Leads Pitt
Over WVU

By MARIE HUFF

Pitt Lady Panther basketball
coach Judy Saurer fit all the pieces
of the puzzle together Wednesday
night, and the picture was a show-
stopper. The Lady Panthers
snapped a three-game losing streak
-with an impressive win over West

' *1 irginia University, 75-43.

With the win, Pitt’s record goes
to 11-7 as they prepare to spend the
weekend in Philadelphia. The
Lady Panthers will battle LaSalle
College tonight and Cheyney State
tomorrow night. 3

It appeared as though West Vir-
ginia would be able to play nip-
and-tuck ball with the Lady
Panthers in the opening minutes of
the game. Carol Dugan started
things for Pitt with a 12-foot
jumper, and Jennifer Bruce fol-
lowed with a free throw and a
basket, but Cathy Parson con-
nected on two baseline jumpers to
bring West Virginia within one

a 5 int, 5-4.

.1’ n the next seven minutes, the
Lady Mountaineers, under con-
stant pressure from Pitt’s hound-
ing defense, managed to put in
only one bucket. The Lady Pan-

thers, on the other ‘hand, scored.

consistently on feeds inside. Center
Gail Augnburns started the streak
with a turnaround jumper under-
neath and Debbie Lewis kept the
West Virginia defense tentative,
hitting a jumper from the top of
the key and then driving for a left-
side layup.

The next two times down court
Lewis went back inside, but this
time passed twice to Bruce, who
canned two shots to give Pitt a 15-6

‘lead midway through the half.

With five minutes remainin_g in
the half, Pitt still maintained a
nine-point margin 19-10. This
time, the spotlight was on the Lady
Panther guards. Freshman Ste-
phanie Collins swished a_l5-footer,
and Dugan popped one from the
corner. The next time down the
floor, Beth Tarasi hit one from the
corner. ~ Freshman Becky Maziarz
then converted a three point play.

Lewis canned another jumper
from the top of the key, and ended
the onslaught by stealing an
inbounds pass and laying it against
the glass uncontested. Pitt owned a
comfortable 32-18 lead at halftime.

“We felt that they couldn't shoot

4» rider pressure," said Saurer. “Par-

# and Bradley were going to get
i eir points, but we noticed that
the other players liked to shoot
uncontested, so we played them
tight.”

The move paid off. Parson and
freshman Olivia Bradley each had
nine points at intermission. How-
ever, they were the only two Lady
Mountaineers in the scoring
column for the first half.

In the second half, Pitt sealed the

' victory in the opening three min-

utes. Lori Lewman, Aiighbnrns,
Lewis, and Dugan each had a
basket to like Pitt’s lead to 40-18. If
that weren't enough, the Lady
Panthers held West Virginia to

 our points from the 13:21 mark to

til‘ 4:46 mark. In that timespan,
Pitt rattled off 23 points 10 lakt‘ 2!
commanding 65-35 lead. ‘
Saurer wasted no time in clear-
ing the bench and giving the
reserves some playing time. And
once again, the Lady Panthersjin
relief were effective. Led by junior

“We don’t believe we can win,”
said disappointed Pitt Head Coach
Rande Stottlemyer following the
Panther 29-12 defeat to Cleveland
State on Tuesday. “We are better
than we wrestled, but we can't keep
making excuses, we got to do it.”

The Panther intensity was lack-
ing as all the team could muster
was two decisions and a pin against
Cleveland State’s four decisions-
two superiors, and one major— to
.win. the Eastern Wrestling League
match.

Terry Urry kept Cleveland’s
momentum going as he came back
from an 8-2 first period deficit to
defeat Pitt’s Joe Throckmorton 13-
12 in the 126 pound match.

At 134 pounds, it was Tim Din-
ger in for injured Craig Richey,
who put the Panthers on the score-
board by defeating “Viking Jack
Carson, 4-2.

mg again, by downing Panther Jeff
Gordon,‘ 13-5, at 142, and at 150
pounds, Randy Cole made it two in

'1 a row for Cleveland State by stop-
ping John Settinari, in for Pitt’s
injured Mike Bond, 16-4.

At 158 pounds, Pitt’s Jeff Jelic
broke a 2-2 tie in the third period by
escaping and taking down Phil
Kennedy on his way to a 6-2
victory.

6 Cleveland State’s Mark Johnson
defeated Pitt’s Eric Harris, 6-1,‘ at
167 pounds.

The only pin of the night came
when Pitt’s Frank Rich reverse-

_ halved Viking Mark Sanders with
19 seconds remaining in the match.

It was all Cleveland State after
that, as Vince Sakas beat Pitt’s
Mark Rich 5-1, and Jim Milo
squeaked past Panther Dan Kas-

dwell on the past as it faces a strong
Lock Haven State team this Sun-'
day at the Pitt Field House. Lock
Haven enters the match with a 10-1
record.

“Lock Haven is tough,”. said
Stottlemyer, “but we can beat them
if we wrestle like we can, and not
like we have been. Every match is a
toss up, so it could go either way.”

The match will start with Lock
Haven slightly favored in the first
match with an experienced Ken

at 118. From there, every match
will be a dog fight. -

At 126 pounds, Throckmorton

Jelic (9-20) goes for his tenth win

Condon,

Stars of

By SEAN BARN ES

Two of the brightest new stars to
emerge on Pitt’s Eastern Cham-
pion swim team are freshmen Greg
Murphy and Doug Condon.
Murphy has already swam times in
his two long-distance freestyle
events that rank him in the East’s
Top eight. Condon's breaststroke
style has been directly influenced
by teammate Sandy Pidgeon, a
former Eastern champion. Condon
will be going for a 200-yard breast-
stroke time tomorrow at West Vir-
ginia University that will push
him into the No. 3 ranking in the
East.

For Panther head coach Fred
Lewis, these two young men are
just what he ordered. When Pid-
geon graduates, both swimmers
will be counted on to replace him
in the long-distance and breast-
stroke events—-two current strong
points of the Panther team.

, Murphy, a graduate of school-
boy swim power Kiski Prep, swam
under Lewis for the.Pitt Aquatic
Club for five years. It was on the
PAC that he saw what college
training would be like and he loved

it. Before graduating from high ,

school, Murphy anchored a junior

(national medley relay of PAC

teammates Ed Bergan, Condon and
Mike Lehto that went into the meet

 
 

The Pitt N(‘\\‘s. l"ritl;iy. _lanu;u‘y 20

Murphy:
Future

ranked second to last and came out
with a second~place finish.

As a senior, ‘Murphy was All-
America in both the 200- and 500-
yard freestyle events. It is this
long-distance talent that earned
him his scholarship at Pitt. Amaz-
ingly, Murphy and Cordon were
rivals at age 13, as both swam a fast
I00-yard breaststroke. for different
teams.

Condon, a breaststroker from an
early age, received excellent train-
ing with the Greater Pitt Swim
Club, near Penn Hills. It was here
he saw some of the best swimmers
in the East, including Pidgeon.
During hisjunior year at Highland
High School, Condon joined the
PAC to see just how college work-
outs would be. He ,excelled
quickly, along with Murphy, on
the medley relay that took second at
junior Nationals in Ft. Lauder-
dale’s Hall of Fame pool.

Condon’s brother is a back-
stroker and engineering student at
CMU. Although he is also an engi-
neering major, Condon feels that
backstroke, and CMU aren’t for
him. His pride‘ for Pitt is very
evident.

“I like Pitt’s team unity,” he
said. “You-still feel individualized
in practices,’ yet the team pride and
team drive is something that can’t

was football.

Well, it is funny how drasti-
cally things change, because
this April Roxanne will not
only be graduating with a B.A.
degree in history, but also with
-a scintillating engagement ring
from, you guessed it, No. ob,
Sunseri.

The marriage of two of Pitt's
most gifted athletes could be
given the billing of an “All-
American Wedding.”

For Roxanne, the first of the
slew of injuries she has suffered
throughout her career may have
-been her “big break.” While at
the Pitt Stadium trainer’s office
having her foot examined for an
allergic reaction her cast was
causing, she met Sunseri for the
first time. V

Roxanne admits, "It really
wasn’t love at first sight, but
things just happened.” Sunseri,
sitting next to Evans, laughed
at the reply.

“Hell no it wasn’t love at first
sight,” Sunseri needled, “I had

' to work on it.”

The enormous amount of
Dublicity that Sunseri gets

Sal Sunseri I

really does not induce any jeal-
ously because, Evans said, “He

deserves every bit of the public- -

ity he gets.” Despite her relative
lack of publicity, Evans is just
as accomplished in’ gymnastics

l as Sunseri is in football.

Evans started gymnastics at
the age of 12 at'the world-
renowned Berks Gymnastics
Academy, in Reading, Pa. This
club has produced many
Olympic-caliber gymnasts
because of its demanding stan-
dards. Her daily training regi-

»men consisted of four-hour

workouts in the afternoon, and
three-hour sessions each night.
The pressure to. do well and
produce was always present,
explained Evans.

“If my coach thought I was

overweight by a pound I wasn’t

allowed in the gym until I lost
it,” said Evans.

But all the hard work Evans
put forth really paid off. She
achieved several distinguished
honors in high school, includ-
ing: state All-around Cham-
pion in 1977, uneven bars State
Champion 1978, and A.A.U.
All-around Champion, just to
name a few. .

“I decided to come to Pitt
because I really liked the coach
and I thought it would be a
great opportunity to help build
a young program,” Evans said.

As a college freshman, Evans
earned All-East honors and it

looked as though there was no .

place to go but up for this
potential superstar. However,
despite her very strong, flexible

' and naturally athletic talent,

she has been plagued by a recur-
ring injury, achilles tendonitis.

Within the last three years,
Evans’ left foot has been in and
out of casts. In fact, she has
worn a cast so often that she has
a closet full of shoes for only her
right foot.

“The doctor this summer
told me that I really shouldn’t
be doing anything as far as
gymnastics - goes, but I just
couldn’t give it up like that,”
commented Evans. Although
she is limited to only one event,
the uneven bars, she has made
the best of it, and has become
one of the best uneven bar
workers on the team. ,

While some athletes dislike
the routine of I training, Evans
says she enjoys it. “Practice is

Both Condon and Murphy are

swimmers, but the tough, less-

dual meets——doesn’t allow much
experimentation by Lewis.

‘Both swimmers’ strengths seem
to be increasing at every practice,
and both commented that the Nau-
tilus lifting: program under Lewis
has toned them up to the point
where they can endure more pain
that the heavy practices bring.

“I love the pain of training,”
says Murphy, “because I know how
much its helping me.”

B_oth Murphy and Condon are
expected to make strong showings

By TODD ERKEL
Ordinary People last years’ biggest
success was a movie that made people
laugh and cry and say "Yeah, I've felt
that _ way.” It was a well-made

‘movie—good acting, crisp cinemato-

graphy, but that really didn't matter.
That's not why we went to see it
again and again. That's not why it
won the Academy Award, they're sel-
dom given on that basis. The story
need only be told and the medium
becamealmost incidental.

Whose Life Is It Anyway?, like Ordinary
People,is such a story. The film comes
at the gut with an arsenal of good
feeling and,sigh, human spirit.

How does a movie about a talented.
sculptor who, after a violent auto
accident is left a quadriplegic, deliver
an enjoyable, let alone exhilarating,
experience? The quick jump in time
from the accident to six months of
intensive care later spares us the
sight of a trauma patient mined with

tubes, the din of the E.E.G. monitor
foreboding death with every blip.
However, the force that rescues »the

-story from morbidity belongs to

Richard Dreyfuss who plays the lead,
Ken Harrison. .
Dreyfuss’ Harrison takes us down

A the path of a quadriplegic——a path of

numbing sameness in which the only
decision left to make is whether to
continue on. Harrison's answer to
this question is no—-no more dialysis,
no more valium, no more. He wants
to be discharged and left to go home
where he can meet the inevitable on
his own terms.

That such an action, which eve-
ryone including Harrison agrees
would be suicide, makes sense is trib-
ute to Dreyfuss, whose articulate,
witty, and uncomprimising portrayal
of Harrison takes over your heart and
plays havoc with reason. Although
backed by a strong supporting cast, it
is Dreyfuss who dominates, using

what little faculties (face and voice)
are left him with a mastery of his
craft. Even the ever-present mugging
that has become idiosyncratic with
Dreyfuss serves to remind us that the
handicapped are placed on a stage by
our attitudes toward them.

This uncomfortable feeling we
have toward the handicapped and the
lack of honesty that masks it is but
one of many conflicts raised in Whose
Life Is It Anyway?. A doctor's commit-
ted responsibility to the preservation
of life clashes with the idea of the free
choice of the person, sick or well. The
quiet, yet powerful performance of
the supporting ensemble takes hold
here as John Cassavetes and Chris-
tine Lahti depict the differing opin-
ions of Drs. Emerson and Scott
respectively. Without a whimper of

"doubt, Dr. Emerson holds tightly to

the very principles that made him a
doctor. Dr. Scott, like we, becomes
entwined in the catch—22 that can't

V""'¢b.
b‘,.;5VA4g

help Harrison to live, yet won't allow
him to die.

Conflict gives way to legalities and
politics and the movie begins to drag.
If Emerson can ’'I owe you one" his
way for two psychiatrist’s signatures

(stating Harrison is depressed, then
the patient remains hospitalized.
Harrison's attorney counters with a
request for writ of habeas corpus. Dr.
Scott counters with melodramatic
attempts at changing Harrison's
mind.

It all culminates in an informal

McMillan plays Judge Wyler with the
_detail that marks so many of his char-
acter pieces. Whose Life Is It Anyway?
doesn't attempt to answer all of our
questions nor does it offer hand-
shakes all around. Ken Harrison had
only one decision to make and it was
his own. He wasn't seeking our opin-
ion, he merely wanted the ballot read-
ied so he could vote...

By IANE HOLAHAN

When you compare Francois,
Truffaut's The Woman Next Door
with most of today's film's, it
stands out as meticulously well
crafted , but compared to the
rich catalogue of Truffaut's past
it comes out as a frustrating
disappointment.

One of his trademarks--the
understatement and matter of
fact attitude works at cross pur-
poses with The Woman Next Door,
and turns it into an unemotional
and at times uninteresting film.
This is particularly frustrating
because the story so obviously
needs passion and excitement to
keep it afloat, but all we get is a
well made film.

There is nothing wrong with
a well made film, but by now
Truffaut can do that in his sleep.
It may be unfair to demand
more from Truffaut than from
other directors, but you go to

  

his flms with high expectations,
so the disappointment is felt
more.

The story is filled with
potential—a couple is accidently
reunited when the woman,
Matilde (Fanny Ardant) moves
in next door to Bernard (Gerard
Depardieu) seven years after
their troubled affair has ended.
Both are married to others, but.
supposedly their passions get
the better of them and the
whole thing ends in tragedy.

Supposedly because we never
get any feeling that the couple
has lost control of their senses.
Ardant, who for some unexplai-
nable reason has been hailed by
Truffaut as "the eighth wonder
of the world,” is about as warm
as a cold fish, and as interesting.
Depardieu on the other hand is
one of those actors who fasci-
nates you, but you are never
sure why, and he is perfect for
the role of Bernard. But when
the two play off of each other

nothing happens, and you're
left trying to figure out why
Bernard would even consider
giving up his happy life with his
wife, who seems ‘much more
interesting than Mathilde. This
throws the whole balance of the
film out the window, and Truf-
faut fails to ever retrieve it.

The film does succeed in por-
traying life as it is, as though we
undraped a curtain around a
group of people, but only in the
first five or ten minutes, after
that it's all melodrama and soap
opera. At least soap operas can
excite you and make you want
to turn‘ in on Monday again, all
this film does is make you keep
on looking at your watch to see
what time it is.

Truffaut has proven time and
time again that he can turn the.
ordinary into the extraordinary,
but The Woman Next Door, despite
a few sparks from Depardieu, is
in a word: dull.

Many have fallen, their dreams

"The winner of the Elvis
bubble—gum cards, 203...this is
official Elvis wine and the
winner is 901, oh God it's Char-
lie.” ”I didn't fix this,” says
Charlie. ”We'll ‘all meet at my

cial Elvis tote bag, Elvis pictures,
Elvis posters—-it went on for

_ nearly an hour. Throughout I

group of women self-

proclaimed as ”Elvis' Little Bud-

raffled and chanced until the
myth that was the greatest per-

former ever to straddle the mic-
rophone was cheapened to a
heap of self-serving artifacts
that symbolize I,’resley's ulti-
mate distruction.

E.L.B. had organized the day,

(
77‘ U
‘4d4yAyY(‘,

\_

January 8, to honor Elvis on
what would have been his 47th

birthday. The irony here, seem- 

ingly missed‘ by all was that it
wasn't his 47th birthday and
why it wasn't nobody seemed to
care. A bronze plaque, bought
with funds raised by E.L.B., was
unveiled inside of Gate 1 at the
Civic Arena. At the ceremony,
E.L.B. plodded along through

superlative, upon superlative of
their Elvis memories. It was all
too hokey—as hokey as
sequined jumpsuits’ and dia-
mond rings. E.L.B. cried in uni-
son as Elvis’ ”My Way" closed
the unveiling. Again the irony
was for naught. He didn't do it
his way, if he had he still would
be...

A special one time showing of
the Presley estate funded docu-
drama ”This Is Elvis” followed
at the Chatam Cinema. It was
here that the scenes of drolling
excess described earlier took
place. Given Pittsburgh's pro-
vincial view on the taking of
chance, it's doubtful "This Is

Elvis’ will ever return. Never-
theless, it is deserving of some
mention. "This -13 Elvis”

attempts to frame a lifetime.

with the use of both staged
scenes and documentary foot-
age. Its success can be argued,
but its attempt is a grande
effort. Dialogue is economized
in favor of narration which is
handled with an almost eerie
eerie similarity by singer Ra‘
Donner. '_

For the unfamiliar of the new
generation, ’’This Is Elvis" can be
informative and nicely offsets
the vomit of one Albert Gold-
man. For others, the movie is
sweeping memorabalia of all
sorts, including highlights of
Presley's screen appearences
(e.g. the death scene from Love
Me Tender , his first film. Rare
footage such as a file film that
resulted out of\the often Puri-
tanical views heldat the time
regarding shaking and swagger-
ing, especially by God lovin cau-
casins was seen. Along this vein,
the ever’ present "hick mayors"
provided a nostalgic laugh but in

it

       
  

 
 

the end, This ls Elvis is a sad
story.

This Is Elvis is at times a great
movie but where Goldman tee-
tered in disgust, ‘This 15 Elvis»
totters fro; 1 a bias all its own.
Head honcno and chief leech
Colqnel T.Parker acts as techni-
cal advisor, "nuff said.”

Nevertheless, the movie
deserves a commercial run and
if for nothing else, we can thank

”Elvis’ Little Buddies” for pro-'
" viding an opportunity to see it.

Much like the legend they so

cling to, E.L.B. '
One night a woman

approached Elvis and presented

him with a small crown on a pil-
low. He asked, ”Whats this?”

She said, ”Its for you. You are‘

the King.” Elvis said, "No
honey. Christ is the King. I'm
just a singer.”

At one time, Elvis has his
priorities in order. 'When he lost
that he lost everything. These
fans have lost or maybe have

never had there's and thus they

have nothing.

For Crushecky, the highlight of
being in the band is recording. Blmul
L)»: [In Rmls, their third album got
good reviews, but was lost in the bar-
rage, a casualty of tight markets and
superstar releases.

”We released the album at the
worst possible time. We ran into
some difficulties at the studio we
were working in. There was a mal-
function which shut it down for two
weeks. We were supposed to release
the first of September and it didn't
come out until the first of October,
and by then all the superstars had
hit-the Stones, the Police and the
best of everything for the Christmas
rushX’

(lrushecky readily admits that
there is a lot more desperation on
H/.~  Ow I 1:. .:'~T-r.t'—. than the previous
albums, and it is easy to project this
onto the band, but (Lrushecky won’t
have any of it. (iranted, after three
albums, all of which got critical
acclaim but disappointing sales fig-
ures, it's easy to begin to wonder
what this band could do to generate
some substantial move forward. If
making terrific albums, touring as
much as possible and keeping your-
self open to the press doesn't do it,
what will?

But (lrushecky does not see things
in negative terms. The fact that the
albums are not selling is almost a
nonissue. "If we felt stagnant .md
were covering the same ground over
and over and over again it would
probably be time to quit, but we don't
feel that. I never get tired of playing
our songs, and I think thealbums are
getting better and better. From the
point we started at to the point
where we have gotten, there's been a
lot of self-satisfaction. I've said this
to a lot of people; we really couldn't
have started any lower. Just to make
one album was a dream but to have
three is icing on the cake as far as
we're concerned.”

(§rushecky’s hard time stories are
certainly in the past, but they are
close enough to prevent him from
losing his perspecive. ”'I‘he Decade
was the first club that ever hired us
and didn't fire us. We got fired for
every reason in the world  we
didn't draw an_v people or we drew
too many people. ()ne time, we were
so desperate for jobs we sat down and
learned about six cover songs, and we
played ’em terrible and we hated
’em.We lasted about two weeks
doing that," laughs (lrushecky.

"We didn't have roadies or equip-
ment and I had a day job then at

Western Center, which is an insti-,

tute for the mentally retarded. We
would have to go to the bar at 8:00
and set up the equipment, play three
sets, then tear things down at 2'00,
drag it back to my house and unload
the van. You didn't get to sleep until
4:00 and had to get up at 7:00 and go
to work the next day. We did that for
about a year and a half.”

Grushecky’s final words from
high atop the Decade are about pink
cadillacs, playing Vegas and probably
the most appropos quote from any
prisoner of rock and roll; ’’It’s too
late to quit now, that's for sure.”

So maybe these days are a relative
pleasure for Crushecky, even though
he hasn't got the one thing he wants
most; a hit record. Then again, with a
band so full of paradoxes who knows,
maybe this time next year every-
thing will work. Those things
happen and nobody really knows
why.

   
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
   
   

        
     
   
    
    
   
   
     
     
    
     
    
   
     
 
     
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    
    

 



Get What

ou Want... 6

BY J. D. KLEINKE

"I'm going to see Mick and the
Stones tonight!” boasted 14-
year—old Janie to her wide-eyed
friends on the school bus.

Three fights with her parents
later, she and two of her class-
mates were strutting into the
tense and smokey air of the
Boomtownﬂrena.

They hummed with anticipa-
tion. All big Stones fans, they
adored Keef and Woodie, and of
course, Mick. They loved Tattoo
You, Some Girls, and especially
the band's earliest album, Hot
Rocks.

"I CAN'T GET NO!" they
chanted from their seats, half-
way through the poorly—rolled
joint Janie had cleverly
smuggled in in the shirt pocket
behind her alligator. The open-
ing acts came and went, and Jan-
ie's spirits soared higher.

The lights finally dimmed;
and a stage basked in cartoon
color turned to face a sea of
screams, revealing the Greatest
Rock And Roll Band In The
World.

Out ran Mick. Janie thought
she would wet her pants.
"Under My Thumb." "Respecta-
ble." Keef hunched over his gui-
tar. ”She’s So Cold." Woodie
tumbles into Mick. "Brown
Sugar.” It was better than she
had ever expected; Mick was
king. He danced and pranced,
swaggered and swayed. He was
a rock and roll wet dream.

Janie and her friends walked
out bubbling, armed with
starchy new T-shirts. Tomor-
row's homeroom show-off was
well worth the twelve bucks.
Besides, it was a super concert.
Definitely the best they had
seen since REO Speedwagon.

~k * * * vk

Johnny's interest in the Rol-
ling Stones was only natural.
When he was in Junior High, the
world was saturated with all
those faceless dance bands and
teen idols-until Chuck Berry.
Johnny loved that music, that
beat; but it wasn't until the
Stones’ first R&B records came
out that he fully appreciated the
rhythms Berry was pioneering.

Richards wasn't ripping Berry
off, as his friends insisted; he
was glorifying him. And the
Stones were tight.

Walking into the Boomtown
Arena, images of the five times
he had seen them colored John-

You Can't lways 

 

ny’s gin-induced memofy. The

exodus of drunken good timers ,

in '78 and '75; the burnt out lat-
ter day hippies in '72; the near-
riot in '69, and the paltry,
unappreciative audience in '65.

The air smelled different
tonight. It was warm, friendly,
festive; but altogether more
sober than ever. Johnny sat
patiently, sipping his stash of
gin, each cut of Aftermath danc-
ing inside his head.

In what seemed like record
time, the amplifier buzz kicked
in as light drenched the most
lavish stage Johnny had ever
seen. Richards looked old. So did
keyboardist Ian McLagan.

"Under My.Thumb" and the
barrage of singles that followed
were probably sloppy, Johnny
thought; but it was almost
impossible to tell. Wireless gui-
tars and an overmix of Jagger's
mike killed three-quarters of
the rhythms Keith worked so
desperately to bash out. The
sound was bad.

Johnny felt really gypped. It
was all a sour joke. ”Satisfac-
tion" accompanied by an ava-
lanche of balloons, he
recounted, walking into the
midnight chill. And Jagger's
stage antics were getting tire-
some. Too much to ignore this
time, he thought. Why did they
even bother bringing guitars?
All Richards had to do was
smoke and look mean and
Jagger could have puked on the
stage, and everyone would have
loved it. Almost everyone.

One by one, working back-
wards, he bought and savored
each album. Let It Bleed was on
the first time he got stoned; Beg-
gar's Banquet, the first time he got
laid. Wherever he was, they
were there too. Whenever he
wanted to tell the world, in the
profound way that is uniquely
adolescent, to fuck itself, the
Stones did it for him.

Jimmy had read about Stones
concerts for years. They were
events; rallys for the young and
angry; riots for a frustrated
generation. That music talked
to him; ”Street Fighting Man,"
"Dead Flowers," "Gimme Shel-
ter." They were not happy
songs. They were" realistic
songs.

Jimmy's seat was in the back
of the arena. But that mattered
little; he knew that people blew
past security, charging the stage
like at no other concert. It was
the Stones’ world, and in the

 

 

Stones’ world the only order

was rhythm and the anarchy it
provoked.

him—pushed to the edge, ready
to explode. The Stones did that
to you.

The lights dimmed. /Years of
anticipation choked Jimmy's
blood. "Under My Thumb." He
was down the first aisle, twenty
feet from the stage, jumping
and thrashing his arms to the
beat. Someone grabbed him
from behind. He knew it was
the crowd, so he pushed back.

It wasn't the crowd. A second
security man grabbed and tore
his collar, pulling him up the
steps of the aisle. The hundreds
nearby just watched. They were ‘
rather stoned and quite happy
with their seats.

Outside, he wished he hadn't
pushed back. His mind wan-
dered in and out of the rhytmic
thud that shook the roof of the
arena. It seemed infinitely far
away.

He wished he had stayed
home and listened to his boot-
legs of the '69 tour. He wished
some of the assholes in the
imitation leather jackets sitting
up front had helped him out.

Then he thought about Brian
Jones, and Altamont; he
thought about the public ban-
nings and the propaganda, and
about his idealized Street Fight-
ing Man and his countless argu-
ments with people about the
band, and life in general.

But it was 1981, and there
was plenty of booze and quaa-
ludes to go around, so none of
that really mattered anymore.

Twennynine with Lenny White

Anyone who questions
whether the recent surge of
black-pop music is a force in the
record business would do well
to tune . into next month's
Grarhmy Awards. While acts
such as The.Rolling Stones and
REO Speedwagon will be con-
spicuous in their absence, the
likes of Quincy Jones, George
Benson,’ and Lionel Ritchie will
no doubt dominate the
proceedings.

/ The diversity of the genre of
popular black music \whether
given the title R&;B, soul, or
black-pop materializes in three
recent releases by Lakeside, The
Whispers, and Twennynine
with Lenny White.

Lateside’s Your Wish Is My
Command on first sight appears
to be a trip in the exotica of

A ancient Arabia. Get beyond the

cover design and all mystery
turns to monotony. While it is a

is listenable but that's it. It's all '

musical qualudes and "have you
played Atari today?" from

‘there. Lakeside should be sent-

enced to tour with The Brady

on a‘ /cdvéf of the I3.e‘atl_es-_"I ,

Granted BWW might not be
for everyone, but if you have a
sense of humor and are willing
to give them a chance, there's

enough good material here to

appeal toa wide audience.

i Main attraction on vinyl, as
well as onstage, is Annabella
Lwin, the band's exotic song-
stress. Not yet old enough to
have developed her voice to its
full potential, she nonetheless
gives the older girls (Harry,
Hynde, Benatar, et al.)a run for
their money. Just listen to her
fierce, popsy warbling on tracks

«. like ”(I’m A) T.V. Savage,”

"Mickey Put It Down," and
”Golly! Golly! Go Buddy!” and

 

Wanna Hold Your Hand”

In contrast, The Whispers’
Love Is Where You Find It depends
on the basics that lend to musi-
cal longevity, this is album
number 13 for the group.

Thegalbum is rather uniquely
tracked, side A for dancin’ and
side B forromancin’. The best of
dancin’ are ”In The Raw,” the
first single that nears the funk

you'll get the picture; what she
lacks in maturity, she more than
makes up for with sheer exub-
erance. Her age works to a defi-
nitehadvantage for BWW’s
repertoire, too: their songs are
mostly ambiguous teenageqlust
anthems, so who better to sing
them than the real McCoy?

So who cares if the words
don't make any sense? The
music does and that's what
really counts.

DOLL BY DOLL

. Doll By Doll

MCA

In Doll by Doll, MCA probably
hopes that they have another
Dire Straits; that's to say, an
intelligent straight rock band
that will have wide appeal.That
may be a bad bet since intelli-
gence is neverparticularly well-
regarded in pop music. At any
rate, this is aldamn good record.

The topic here is love: New
love, dying love, love for the yet
to be born, love for one who has
died. Love is the most over-
worked .~'subject in popular
music, yet these come off as
fresh.

Another aid is that these guys
seem to be able to play almost
anything they choose. ”Caritas”
is a screaming rock-e_r;_. ”Soon
New Life ”manages to come off
as Caribbean by making a man-
dolin sound like steel drums,-
”Main Traveled Roads” is a
straight folk piece with an
almost dirge-like tempo. These
three songs are back-to-back on
the first side, so one gets an idea
of the jumps in the mood and
style these players make.

Finally, there's lead singer
Jackie Leven. This fellow is one

 

but lacks the punk of a Rick
James and ”Turn Me Out," a
slick number. with the added
complexities of horn and string

" arrangements. When flipped to

romancin’, The Whispers’ R&B_
balladry has few peers. Best
among them is ”Say Yes” whose
smooth harmonies and rain-
drop percussion gives you
instant ”last dance, where's my
girl?" atmosphere.
Twennynine with Lenny
Whiteis Just Like Dreamin finds
common ground between
today's punk-funk rhythm and
vocal standards set by early
”Temps” and others. Unlike
Your Wish or Love Is Where" You

Find It, just Like Dreamin never lets .

up its intensity. Class.musician-
"ship laced with fusion riffs sets
it apart from the blase of The
Whispers and shows Lakeside
and its exotica for the amateurs
they remain. It is all right, from
the silk of ”Rhythym” to a
splash of reggae in "Don't Look
Back” to the ahh—diIeamy single,
”Just Like Dreamin.”
Versatility reigns as the six
member (four male, two female)
Twennynine share the vocals,
promenading in and out of cho-
rus and bridge on nearly every
tune. Iusi Like Dreamin is one fine

that deserves the title ”vocalist.”
Most front people just sing.
This fellow sounds like he
means it, and that means a lot
more than just being technically
good —- it means sounding like

Maybe these guys wouldn't
bring off live the style that they

AQUA DREAM
McGuffey Lane
Atco

McGuffey Lane had two
chances last year to show the
public what they had to offer.
One was touring with the Char-
lie Daniels Band. The other was
capturing their clean, country-
rock music on a self—entitled
debut album.

Their second album, Aqua
Dream, has still more to offer; it
has a little of everything. ”Don’t
Think About Me (When I'm

— Gone)" and ”Start It Over"
sound a lot like the material on
the first album. ”Fal,lin’ Timber"
is a sad song with Top-Forty
potential while ”A New Begin-
ning” and ”It Comes From The
Heart” are rockers with country
touches blended in.

The sextet are efficient at
bringing their music across.
They work well with their
instruments (listen to "Bag Of
Rags"), and ”Dream About
You” contains some fine
harmonizing.

McGuffey Lane's Aqua Dream
is a good album. Fans of Pitts-
burgh's Highway Ghost and
other similar bands should find
it very appealing.

ing, despite its claim to be ”new”
is'the same old stuff. Last year it
seemed fresh and inspired, but
now it just seems repetitive and
boring. There are no stand-outs
like the aforementioned,
although "Stand And Deliver”
isn't too bad. Most of the cuts
are rather pathetic; I guess it's

hard to keep writing lyrics to

the same music. ..

As for the new image (the

TAKE NO PRISONERS

_ Molly Hatchet

Epic ‘ ~”
I Take No Prisoners, the ”almost"
new Molly Hatchet album,

, reminds me of a James Bond

novel; lots of loose women, hard

drinking and electronic-

wizardry. Take No Prisoners, just
like the Bond books, is also easy
to predict.

There isa lot of the first three
Hatchet albums on Prisoners. The
electric guitar magic supplied by
Hlubek, Holland, and Rolandis
in the same style; Thomas and
Crump still give a steady beat,
and Farrar still sings about par-

ties and rock ’n roll. But like Ian ‘

Fleming, author of the Bond
novels, these guys always keep a
couple of steps ahead of
monotony. -

Best cuts from the disk are
”Bloody Reunion,” ”Loss of
Control,” and‘ ”Don't Mess
Around." Another good tune is
”Lady Luck”; it has all the mak-
ings of a Hatchet regular, and a
slight twist, there are horns and
a piano in the background for
color. A

All the songs on Prisoners are
up—beat and tight; the band is
sharp enough to split hairs, but
still there is no catalyst here to
make this album a stand out. If
you liked past Molly Hatchet
albums, the self—titled debut,
Flirtin' With Disaster and Beatin'the
Odds, Take No Prisoners should
find a spot in your record
collection.

LIVING IN A MOVIE
Gary Myrick and the Figures
Epic

Gary Myrick is in the wrong

end of the music business. His
second album with the Figures,
Living In A Movie, is testament to
the speculation that maybe
Myrick should be ”writing
music for the movies" instead.
Myrick and the Figures were
added to Epic Records roster
during the 1979-80 blitz to sign
any band that so much as wore a,
skinny tie or sounded avant-
garde. About two years later,

Myrick seems to be a survivor—- .
at least so far. His first album, I

Gary Myrick -and the Figures, was
promising and even had a semi-
hit single with/’She talks in Ste-
reo” that was, believe it or not,
semi—popular in Pittsburgh.

With Living In A Movie, Myrick
seems to be in a holding pattern.
The album seems to be largely

I in the same vein as the first one

§.
" 

lectronic keyboards matings
that evoke a futuristic techno-
sterile coldness. The effects of
Myrick’s music is dichotomous.

On cuts like "Tattooed On My _

Forehead,” ”No Crisis," “ and
most of side two Myrick’s guitar

" work is strangely stirring.How-

ever, with songslike ”Penetrat.e
My Heart” and ”Romance" the
end result is one of monotonous
droning.

Myrick’s lyrics are another .

story. The penmanship just
doesn't hold up. Sure, song lyr.- I
ics aren't poetry but these aren't
even lyrics. It's hard to tell
whether he's trying to be
abstract, artsv, or whether I19
just doesn’tgive a damn. Unfor-
tunately, most of this stuff. is
drivel. '

Nonetheless, once past the
numerous cliches and galactic
beatnik phrasings of the lyrics,
Gary Myrick’s music has the
potential volatility of a spark in
a Hormel Chili Shack. Where's
the spark?

Conclusion: If Gary Myric
wants to be successful he should
a)'have someone else write his
lyrics; b) try real hard to write
better lyrics; or c) take up writ-
ing instrumental movie
soundtracks.
