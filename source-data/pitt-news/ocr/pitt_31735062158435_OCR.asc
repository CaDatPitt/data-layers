Civil Service Commission Sets

A new student trainee exami-
nation for use in selecting college
students and high school grad-
uates for work-study programs in

various federal agencies has been
announced by the United States
Civil Service Commission.

The training programs are in
the scientiﬁc, technical, agricult-

ﬁelds. Some positions are located
in Washington’, D.C., and the near-
by area. Others will be ﬁlled
throughout the country.

Trainees will be paid $3,255 to

$3,755 a year during the-periods
in which they are employed. Stu-
dents must be enrolled in, or ac-
cepted for enrollment in, a curri-
column- in college leading to a
bachelor’s degree in one of the
ﬁelds included in this training
program. A written test will be
given.

Further information and appli-
cation forms are available at many

try, and at the United States_'Civil‘
Service Commission, Washington
25, D.C. Applications will be ac-
cepted until April 2, 1959.

Yes, we’\_'e done it! The In-
stant Sport Shirt is a reality.
lVith the new Van Heusen
Vantage Sport Shirts, all you
do is add water . . . and
presto . . . a fresh, handsome
sport shirt springs to life be-
fore your very eyes. And a .
sport shirt .that’s all cotton!
Is it a miracle? Is it a powder?
Is it a pill? A grind? Read on.
You see,» the new Van
Heusen Vantage Sport Shirts
work this way. First, you buy
one (this is terribly impor-
tant), then you wear it for a
while. Then you remove it
from your pampered body,
drop it into the sink, and
ADD WATER. In_ moments,
a new sport shirt begins to
appear, a sport shirt as fresh
and new-looking as the one
you bought in the’ store.
Amazed, you remove it from
the water, hang it up for a

 

\

bit, and it’s ready to wear.
Friends will ask, “How do
you manage to afford a new
shirt every day?” You will an-
swer,“I was left a huge sum of
money by an aunt in Texas.”
And we will not. divulge your
secret! -
The all cotton Van Heusen
Vantage Sport Shirts that
drip—dry so quickly (tumble-
dry automatically, too) and
wear so wonderfully are avail-
able in a wide range of checks,
stripes and solids. All have
sewn-inistays that can't get
lost and keep your collar al-
ways neat. They cost a mere

. $5.00. (It’s time you wrote

home, anyhow.) And remem-
ber, all you need do is ADD
WATER. If you haven’t any
water, we’ll send some FREE.

And so is the need for up-to-the-minute telephone communications.
That's where Gen Tel comes in big. To meet the growing need for
telephone service, we're installing 750 new phoneseach day, invest-

said via Edward R-. Murrow’s
novel program, “Small World,”
that there is little chance that a
clean bomb would "be used -‘by

Closed CiirciuitCoron,ari.es¥

By Joseph Ungor
University pre-med students were recently in-
vited to a special movie up at the Health Profes-
sions building. a ,'
yearls closed circuit tele-
vision broadcast which attempted to show to doc-
tors_ throughout Zthe-‘couﬁtrypsome of-the latest ad-

zheart disorde1's3“4" ~ .

’ A mdderator;"’ahd-._;;La panel of
eminent physicians, ‘many ‘of .
them \’ clinic and med-school
‘heads, sat in front of a large

_ television mo'nitor. Siimetimes '
the monitor _re_rnairied blank as
the men carried on discussions
of the" merits-or drawbacks of
certain treatmentsp ' . _
For instance, a great arhount of time was spent
_ talking ‘about the "positive value of the widely em-
‘ployed fat‘.-free diet. At- such periods, thelanguage
often dipped into a‘ somewhat technical‘ vein, and
' the in'experien_ced‘a'udien'ce became acutely!‘ aware
of a'lou'd, grinding squeak in the projector. "
But at other times, events of a more immediate,
and‘ dramaticnature took place.’ One of the panel
members would describe the operative technique he

i preferred for the treatment of a problematic con-

dition.

. Then the monitor would pick up ./this speciﬁc
type of operation, (complete with sound) being
performed at that éxactmoment in the physician’s
representative clinic‘ or hospital, while the
physician gave a running account of the pr_o—
cedure. ‘ '

Afterwards, the other panel members would
:pass judgement on the operation. And the judge-.
ment was not always favorable.

Once, in particular, the words of a member
were so unfavorable as to be purposefully rude. A
method aimed at stimulating increased vascula-
tion of the ‘heart was presented over the_monitor.

~ The heart was exposed through an suitablechest

Then, ‘ instead of'."some, type'."o‘f_fd'elicate’.-

 

stringent policy on information about clean bombs‘
is rather obscure. It would appear to the layman
that this information, should a Russian general be

p in a good mood when the ﬁring begins, might

save a few million American lives.
But then, Russians are rarely in good moods.

An Academic gcontroversy

. ‘ \
A ~ Another controversial question which was again

»brought .up on this program was the academic

exercise about whether ’twould be better to have
the total destruction of the human race, or the
whole world living under a “poor” form of gov-
ernment.  _ A
Russell takes the very logical viewpoint that it
would be far better to have the human beings
ground who might eventually. effectta changein
government rather than sack the whole human
race to limbo. ’ ‘
. Many tend to disagree with this View thinking
that it would beva‘ horrible thing to live in a

,Communist world or some “1984” type creation.

And I‘ would agree that Democracy ‘is preferable.

‘But it could be that some Soviet party mem-
bers are just as determined that living under a
“Capitalistic” from of government is_objectionable.
And to .-that individual, it might be every bit as
bad. _

So whether an All—Earth Democratic or Com-
munistic form of government should be extant, it
seems ridiculous that people cannot agree, however
academic-the question, on‘the fact that life itself
is the most valuable “principle.” '

The U. S. Government must begin thinking in
terms of .i'nternationalism. Whether we like it or
not, we are going to be responsible to a great ex-
tent, for the future of people irimany lands, under
m‘any“diﬁerent ideologies. - .

_ ‘.We’d better learn to live with it, or‘ many of us
may have to die with it. '

Fine, For_..A Dog

When asked his opinion of this technique, one
of the physicians immediately and wryly began,
“Its ﬁne-——if you’re working on a dog . . .” Gen-
erally, ‘however, theldigalopgue wasmore restrained
and objective. . " i _  1-  ‘

Possibly the most engrossing part of the movie
was the portion concerning a highly‘ involved op-
eration that ran into complications. Not only was
it engrossing, it was moderately frightening.

_, The operation entailed both a stoppingof the
heart,and a severing of the’ aorta. A mechanical
heart hagpd, "of course, been connected to- maintain
circulation.’ Here, as all his actions ﬂashed across
the monitor, the performing surgeon conversed in
a casual tone with the distant panel moderator.

-.“I see you have the heart nicely quiet,” said
the moderator. A ‘ ‘ - ’

_“Yes,”but ’don’t worry. I’ll get it started again,”\

‘.answ ered the surgeon. »

‘_‘I’m sure, you will,” said the moderator with n
hint of attempted. facetiousness. ‘ ‘ ’

_B_lood Began To Spurt

The surgeon worked on. Suddenly the unex-

"pected happened, and_ blood began to spurt into

the opening. *-

. "‘Can’t'”you do something?” asked an agitated
voice somewhere within the room. “He’s bleeding
like hell out of the aorta.”
The surgeon began searching for. the source of
his difficulty. : _ , _
At this point the moderator took‘ over, and. he

. handled the situation quite deftly. “I see you’re

having trouble, so we’ll have to return later on in

the program,” he said. Then he switched off the.

monitor.- _ - _,

Go. Team, Go   is
For What?  

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

 

And suddenly it is as if the season had never begun. The air of '
‘ high expectancy and taut nervous energy has vanished with another
unhappy affair with Syracuse. The last three games on the schedule,
onceiviewed as an inviting ﬁnale to a torturous season, have lost their
luster. The last weeks now assumethe prospect of a job which must
necessarily be completed.’ . ‘« ‘
A single, bitter loss to The Orange produced this “shortened”
schedule; but why? Not because the defeat was a startling reversal of
form, not because the Panthers played a poor game, not because
-Notre Dame, Nebraska,“ and Penn.State have decided to roll over
and play dead for us. _ C

"E Rather, the goal of the Panthers has been__ put just about out of
‘reach. That goal would naturally be a bid to? play in a bowl game—‘
either the Orange or the Cotton. The coaches, and perhaps even the

players, will deny that this is the” aim of this year's team.

Last year’s squad,‘ replete with publicized nick names and a raft
of avid drum-beaters, was a major disappointment. to the ‘fairest of
critics. Secondly, Pitt/has fared rather badly for several years with
the nation’s pollsters who accused- them of dropping the big ones.
The last of the major. reasons is that the team would liketo show
the Pitt student body that they, indeed, deserve better support than
the latter has troubled itself to display. _’ \ '
‘Psychologically, these three reasons for shooting, go-for-broke,
ata bowl bid are indefensible. They provide strong motivation for
all the performers. However, it is to be doubted that the sole ob-
ject of college football is to win. This idealistic criticism has been
batted about before, but use has little impaired its validity. To seek
the f‘bubble reputation’’ has been a. constant sin ‘of the so-called_
.“mighty” in all sports. ’ ' I ' ' ‘ - '
This objection to a fanatical desire to win and establish the
fact of football supremacy-‘may eliminate the ﬁrst two reasons for the
team’s determination to excel, but by no means explains away the
’third. This year’s Panthers have played ﬁne imaginative football
(mostly in the second halves, it is true) and yet’ the sound from the
never—full student section is never more than an appreciative vvhimper.
- -- =l= =4: =l= =l= Ii:
‘ Professionaliathletes may be able‘to subsist without visible and
vocal support, but collegians néver have. Again the cynic. may say
thatthe “rah-rah” stuff is for the birds, and anyone who advocates
spirit is ‘a namby—pamby. Perhaps he is right in the ﬁnal analysis,
after the four years are over, but he must not expect his team to
win many football games.  -
The difference between the good and the great is often a matter
of sweat expended. People are not prone to exert themselves if they
.don’t think their peers will appreciate their ‘effort. The feeling that
_ the average fellow in Math 22 gives adamn whether he does a good
job on Saturday can signiﬁcantly boost a player's drive.
The team has had little emotional fodder to go on -‘during any of
their seven games. After generally poor beginnings, UCLA being a
notable exception, it has been the lot_ of ‘the coaches to, do a fast job
, of “hypo—ing” morale between the halves. This is notpa healthy situa-
tion for any proud university’s team. ' ' »

driven back. Blame’ not poor plays or bad coaching for the near-

 ill Mack Returns to Home Grounds *

George Izo, the lad who collaborated with Aubrey Lewis?
on a 76-yard touchdown play to down the Panthers'l3-6 at
South Bend last year, has ﬁnally won the starting quarter-
back position from Bob Williams for Saturday’s game at the

Actually Izo received the starting nod from Coach Terry

er with Navy at Baltimore and he
responded with a performance
that led the Irishyto a relatively
easy 40-20 triumph over a sup-
posedly strong Navy eleven.

The top star of the day against
the Midshipmen however, turned
out to be a sophomore halfback

“Red” Mack the -6-foot 175-pound
star from "Hampton Township
High School tallied two touch-
downs in Notre Dame’s victory.

Mack was _ an unheralded-
sophomore when the season he-

he“ deserved -the starting left

halfback position by scoring. on .
long runs in Notre Dame’s~ first

two games against Indiana and

SMU.‘.

Mack-originally wanted to come
to Pitt for his college training, but
failed to meet the entrance re-
quirements there.
Coach Brennan’s squad has
compiled a 4-2 record to date. The
Irish have downed Indiana,
Southern Methodist, Duke, and
Navy while- losses came at" the
hands of Army and Purdue. The
win over Navy lifted Notre Dame
back to the top ten in the weekly
football ratings. '
The Irish lost twelve lettermen
from the 1957 teafnwhich‘ had ‘a
7-3 chart with all defeats at ‘the
hands of teams ﬁnishing high in
the national polls. ' -
Twenty—ﬁve' lettermen have.

Cecconi Charges Fresh Team.

Still in High School,C1oryi Days

By JACK SMITH‘ . 

From all appearances the fresh-
man tootball team has slumped

into a state of complete lethargy}.

“I know we are potentially better
than your past two performances
have shown,” said Coach Lou Cec-
coni, “but for_ some ‘reason, the
team is not putting out.”

An apparent change has taken
xplace since the freshinen’s ﬁrst
game with West Virginia. Since
that contest, which the Panther
cubs won 35-0, there has "been
an overall slump in all positions.

’ This noticeable? changeis most
seen in the. backﬁeld. There has
been a lack of running and block-
eing, especially among the starters.

According to Cecconi, “We’re

just not the same team. If some of _

the boys would forget about the
glory’ that they gained in high
school, and remember that they
are men now, they would play
the kind of ball they are capable
of.” .

Cecconi was quick to point out
the ﬁne play of lineman Regis
Coustillac and back Regis Welsh,
who is not even a scholarship
player. “There are bound to be a

few changes in this week’s line-
up,” Cecconi said.- ' “”

The Panther Cubs are scheduled
to play Kent State tomorrow’ at

Pitt Wildwood Club. Last year the,

frosh downed Kent, 44-0.

The Yogi results which are

As usual, Coach John Michelo-

the same outﬁt that beat us last

score in the ﬁrst half sothat we
would not have to exert ourselves
so much after the halfti1né‘inter-
mission. We move the ball well in
the opening half, but we just can”:
