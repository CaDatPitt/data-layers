DiMaccio Proposes Allocation Process Change

By MIKE KANE

Pitt News Staff Writer

I

Student Government Board presidential candidate Drew
DiMaccio proposed a constitutional amendment at last
night’s , Inter-Fraternity Council meeting that would
reserve 15 percent of the student activities fee for the seven
student governance groups.

He also asked the council to endorse the amendment, a

move the council tabled until their next regular meeting on
Jan. 23, the second day of SGB elections.
Engineering Student Cabinet member Bernie Popko said
the Cabinet unanimously endorsed the amendment
Monday. Stan Galanski, DiMaccio’s opponent in the
presidential race, said he is “strongly opposed” to the
proposal. .

DiMaccio announced the proposed amendment during a
meet-the-candidates session that was on the agenda of the

“Fifteen percent of the student activities fee will be
aired directly for governance groups. Of the 15 percent,
one percent will be given as a blanket (grant) to all seven
groups, which will amount to $2,000 per governance group.
The remaining percentage will be distributed proportion-
ately,” said DiMaccio.

"‘It’s a revolutionary way of budgeting money to the
governance groups. It’s a way of eliminating politics and
promoting ﬂoating budgets to governance groups. It puts
them in a nondiscriminatory line,” said DiMaccio.

After the meeting, Galanski said he is opposed to the
proposal because it would be hard for the student
government to monitor how funds would be spent.

“It’s not an equitable base of funding because what you
have is a situation where you’re allocating student money
without any regard for how it will be spent,” Galanski said.

“It’s irresponsible to allocate money without concern for
how it will be spent in terms of programsand services.”

The governance groups now are allocated money the
same way any other student organization receives funds. A
group requests a certain amount of funds from the student
government Allocations Committee and the committee
decides if the groups deserve the money requested.

The Allocations Committee then recommends how much
money the particular group should receive. SGB reviews
the committee’s recommendations and can either accept or
reject them.

Petitions for the proposed amendment are being
circulated now, DiMaccio said. Six hundred signatures are
needed to place the amendment on the ballot for this
month’s elections.

If the amendment is successful, it would mean the
governance groups would be allocated approximately

Ofﬁcers of the residence hall
councils met last night with JoAnn
Gibbs, assistant director of the
Ofﬁce of Residence Life, to draft a
list --of recommendations to the
housing ofﬁce that would tighten
campus security.

“People, especially girls, are
afraid to go anywhere around the
campus at night by themselves.
That’s not fair, “Inter-Residence
Board President John Rossick said.
“I think we should advise the
housing ofﬁce about the recom-
mendations that we have so that
the residents can have peace of
mind.“

Several students at the meeting

Senate Council adopted Monday
a recommendation by its Task
Force on Faculty Proficiency in
Spoken English that outlines
procedures for determining and
solving faculty problems with use
of the English language in
classroom lectures.

Chairman Prof. George Shames
said the task force was charged by
Senate Council to investigate
whether the university does have a
substantial problem with “the
inability of certain instructors to
express themselves in English,"
and to report guidelines for
alleviating such problems.

Given the number of complaints
made to department heads and

Snatchers,” is probably a better bet.

deans concerning an ‘ English
language barrier between some
faculty members and students

(including faculty members to

whom English is the native
tongue), the task force report
presented by Shames to council
recommended the ‘following:

Determining whether prospec-
tive faculty speak English proﬁ-
ciently. Prospective faculty without
sufﬁcient English ability who are
highly qualiﬁed otherwise would be
referred to the Ofﬁce of Faculty
Development and other related
offices for help in dealing with the
problem.

Periodic review of present
faculty by deans and department
chairmen to maintain a high level
of language proﬁciency. Any

instructor found to have problems
speaking English would be referred
to the Ofﬁce of Faculty Develop-
ment and, in extreme cases,
relieved of teaching duties until the
problem is corrected.

Having at least one section of a
course being taught by an English
language proﬁcient when several
sections of a course are offered.

—Establishing an individual in
each dean's office to deal with such
problems. Students would be
encouraged. to approach the in-
structor ﬁrst with complaints.

If consultation with the instructor
does not alleviate the problem,
then deans or department chair-
men would either direct the faculty
member to the Ofﬁce of Faculty
Development for help while he or

she continues with class instruction
or remove the instructor from
classroom duties while he is
conquering English language prob-
lems. Whatever the course of
action, students would be per-
mitted to change course sections.

After debate by Senate council
members, Shames emphasized that
removal of instructors from class-
rooms will only occur under
extreme circumstances, and any
heads on both undergraduate and
graduate levels.

According to Senate council
president Dr. David Engels the
approved recommendation will now
move through formal procedures to
the Provost, Chancellor, and deans
of the university.

Resident Students Recomend
Dormitory Security Changes

(Continued from page 10)

closely watched by desk attendants
or campus police.

Gibbs said that such a monitor-
ing system might not be successful
because it would be impossible for
a single desk attendant to monitor a
building such as the Towers with a
single viewing console. She said
also that the television monitoring
system installed at Lothrop Hall
was stolen recently.

The group said that 24-hour
security would help tighten resi-
dence hall security. With this
measure, the group asked also that
access to the ground floor of the
Towers be completely eliminated.

Gibbs said that elimination of
free access to the ground ﬂoor
would cause problems for groups
such as the Pitt Photo Club, which
has its darkroom facilities in the
basement of Tower B. She added
that beginning this week the
Towers laundry room will be closed
after 8 p.m. until further notice.

Several members of the group
expressed the desire to see
washers and dryers installed on
every floor, a measurethat would

eliminate the Towers laundry
room.

Tim Kearney, Inter-Residence
Board representative from Mc-
Cormick Hall, said that an
attendant should be stationed in
the laundry room. The group
agreed with this but Gibbs added
that if a security person was
stationed‘ in the laundry room, the
person must be trained profession-
ally in residence hall security.

Several- group members were
concerned with the attitude of
residence hall attendants toward
checking student identification
when people enter the dormitories.
Many of the students said they
believed that the desk attendants
do not check the residence hall
identiﬁcation cards closely enough,
if they check them at all.

“The question here seems to be
how we can get the students to
cooperate with the desk atten-
dants," Gibbs said. She cited
incidents of students arguing with
the attendants or not wishing to
show identiﬁcation when entering
the residence halls.

One of the recommendations by
several resident students advo-

cated an escort system for females
in the residence halls.

Under the escort system, any
female student walking alone to
any part of the campus could
consult a list of volunteer male
students who would escort them to
their destination. Both the male
and female students would be
required to sign a sheet and show
identiﬁcation before leaving.

'l‘he students asked also that the-

Residence Hall Judicial Code be
changed to make any violation of
security measures, such as refusal
to show identification when enter-
ing a building or use of a false
identification card, would result in
a summons to appear before the
judicial board.

Gibbs urged the group to
undertake a massive residence
hall-wide poster campaign to warn
students of the consequences if
they did not obey security
procedures.

Gibbs advocated the installation
of an emergency phone in the
laundry room that would link
Towers residents directly with the
campus police.

money. The groups were allocated
approximately $22,500 this year.
Since total allocations from next
year's activities fee ﬁgures will
drop slightly because of declining
enrollment, the increase in gover-
nance organizations’ allocations
would be at the expense of other
student organizations.

However, according to figures
suplied by Popko from the
University Office for Institutional
Research, which compiles statisti-
cal research for the University.

approximately 500 to 8,000 stu-
dents belong to one of the
governance groups, which are the
Black Action Society, the IFC, the
Inter-Hononary Council, the En-
gineering Student Cabinet, the
Panhellic Association, the Nursing
Student Organization, and the
Resident Student Organization.
One student may belong to a
number of governance organiza-
tions, however.

DiMaccio said he realized there
would be students who belong to
more than one group. “In any

governance group, no matter
where the allocation goes, there is
overlapping. ”

The amendment would increase
the allocations to every governance
group except the Black Action
Society, which will lose approxi-
mately $4,000, according to ap-
proximate ﬁgures presented by
Popko. who is also an SGB
member. The Nursing Student
Organization, which requested only-
$475 last year, would enjoy the
greatest increase. from $325 to

V A Change
for the Better?  

A. At last night’s Interfraternity Council meeting,
Student Government Board presidential candidate
Drew DiMaccio proposed a constitutionai amen-
dment that would relegate 15 percent of the student
activities fee to governance groups. ‘

groups, which received $22,500 last year, would be
allocated approximately $40,000. Each group would
receive one percent of that total.

“One percent will be given as a blanket (grant) to.

all seven groups,” DiMaccio said, “which will
amount to $2,000 per governance group. The
remaining percentage will be distributed propor-
tionally (among other student organizations.) It’s a
revolutionary way of budgeting money to governance
groups.” . .

Revolutionary, maybe, but not totally fair or just.

The increase would benefit some governance
groups, such as the IFC and the Panhellenic
Association. The Engineering Student Cabinet,
which usually receives much less than it requests
from theI:‘Student Government Board, would also
stand to benefit from the amendment.

But, by DiMaccio’s plan, the Nursing Student
Organization would receive the ludicrous sum of ap-
proximately $3,800. What would a student
organization, which last year requested $475 from
the SGB and received $325, do with all that extra
money? The nurses were obviously satisfied with
$500 or less annually. »

Also, the Black Action Society, which now receives
more money than other governance groups, would
take a substantial cut in funding. It is naturalto
assume that BAS leaders will be strongly opposed to
such a proposal.

And what would happen to the various SGB com-
mittees and student organizations? They would suf-
fer considerable damage and many could be forced to
dissolve altogether. '

Page 4—Wednesday, January 10. 1979

The IFC tabled .a vote of approval on the amen-
dment for two weeks (until Tuesday of election
week), but will probably receive the 600 signatures
needed to appear on the ballot because the
engineering cabinet has already indicated its support
and there are a number of engineering students.

But, the amendment, if it appears in its present
-form, should not be approved by the student body
during election week. The plan is sketchy at best,
and until DiMaccio and others can assure student
organizations they will not be shortchanged in the

‘ allocations process next year, it cannot be accepted.

The current procedure for distributing money to
student groups has its faults, but an amendment
more complete and concrete than DiMaccio’s must
be proposed before these faults can be corrected.

some misconceptions... .

A recent issue of The Pitt News
attributes to the CAS Dean in
Council remarks about the School
of General Studies that need
correcting.

It simply is not true that
“prospective CAS students are
subjected to an admissions process
while there are no requirements set
forth for the admission of a student
to'SGS classes.” ,- ,

SGS has an admissions process
different from that of CAS'and for
good reason. Because most new
’S,GS students have been out of high
school for ﬁve to ten years and may
have become quite differently
motivated than they were earlier,
they are not required to submit
SATs and somewhat less weight is
given to high school class rank.

But every one of them is
evaluated for evidence of ability to
handle college study. Some are
rejected and marginal ones are put
in provisional status requiring less

, than full course loads in order to
demonstrate their ability in their‘

first 18 or so credits.

All SGS students must maintain

.a 2.0 QPA or be put on probation,

again requiring a reduced load
while they try within a reasonable
time to bring up their QPA, and are
dismissed if they are unable to do
so by . that more concentrated
effort. .

‘ . It is perhaps worth noting also

that SGS students are required to
fulfill an even more exacting
degree-structure requirement than
are CAS students, including a
public speaking (speech) course,
two composition courses, a / se-
quence of courses in math, logic or
foreign language, and 12-course-
distribution credits in each of the
three areas and nine more at the
upper division level. By the time
SGS students also have completed
their majors (the biggest profes-
sional major, business, being at
least as demanding as anything in
CAS), they have had to prove
themselves fully the equals of any
other Pitt students.

The concern expressed over
cross-listing unfilled CAS day

courses for SGS students also is
false. The implication clearly is
that mixing SGS students with CAS
students in the same classrooms is
somehow bad for the latter. The
facts are that SGS and CAS
students have long been freely

mixed in day courses in the third

term and spring and summer
session classes, thagts much as 10
percent of the fall and winter term
enrollment in SGS evening classes
consists of CAS students, and
that CAS itself cross-lists. about 70
SGS evening courses a term. It is a
little difficult to understand why
such mixing is bad before 5 p.m.
but acceptable after 5 p.m. or is
bad from September through April
but all right from May through
July.

To get to the basic misconcep-
tion, though, the implication that
quality is what is at stake here, is a

. . . . and contradictions

As a part-time student enrolled
in the School of General Studies, I
was appalled by your front page
article of Dec, 6: “SGS, ‘CAS Deans
Differ on Methods to Boost Rolls.”
In this article,’ CAS Dean Irwin
Schulman stated that evening
classes at Pitt constitute only a
“community service," and he
seemed to believe that allowing
SGS students to cross-register into
CAS classes would somehow
undermine the function of the
University which, in his words, is to
provide “...a liberal arts education
for undergraduates. . . ’ ’

I hold a full-time job, and to
increase my knowledge and mar-
ketability in my chosen field, as
well as to broaden my personal
horizons, I would like to earn a
bachelor's degree. My question is
this: Is Dean Schulmah saying that
I am getting an inferior education
because I have to attend evening
classes? And, if so, doesn’t that
contradict what he claims is the
function of the University? And if
SGS is in fact inferior in quality to
CAS, then why does the

 SGS faculty attempt to claim

otherwise?

Last spring, the SGS student
cabinet and faculty initiated a
campaign to change the name of
the school, because, as I under-
stood it, the present name connotes
a limited curriculum and doesn’t
offer undergraduate degrees.
which it indeed does.

As I recall. no one came up with

. remarks

with, SGS students can be a

challenging. experience which,

might help satisfy a concern Dean
Schulman expressed elsewhere
(University Times, Nov. 30) when
he referred to his “first class
scholarly faculty...not matched by
the quality of the student body we
have assembled.”

‘\

Steele Gow, Dean

a satisfactory alternative. Could
this possibly be because SGS
doesn’t offer the same type of
curriculum as a full-time liberal
arts university, and to imply that it
did would be misleading? At the
time, I offered the suggestion that
both divisions simply be called the
University of Pittsburgh, assuming
that they were basically the same
programs, and the only difference
was thatone was a “day” school,
and one was a “night school.
Apparently, the differences are
greater than this.

Dean Schulman’s condescending
infuriate me, but the
thought that they may be true is
even more upsetting. I want the
best possible education I can get,
and I don’t think the fact that I can
only attend school part-time should
prevent me from getting it. But if I
can only get the kind of quality
education I want by attending day
school, then I don't think it's fair of
the School of General Studies to
lead me to believe that what they
offer is the same thing.

Maybe the two schools, SGS and
CAS. could put their respective
heads together, and put the needs
and desires of the students ahead
of any University politics that may
be involved. Maybe then I could be
assured that I was receiving the
best possible education from either

. of the two schools.

‘Body Snatchers’ Remake — Absorbing Sci Fi

By JIM LEWIS

Pitt News Staff Writer
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
Directed by Philip Kaufman

In these days of star-studded,
expensively technical, overly-gala
remakes of humbly-good old
movies (remember “King Kong?’’)

-, it is refreshing to see one that

stresses the arts of direction,
ﬁlming and screenwriting like
“Invasion of the Body Snatchers.”

Director Philip Kaufman creates
an absorbing sc_ience—~ fiction
mystery, based on an earlier
engrossing ﬁlm of the same title,
mixing the grandiose special

effects with a plot:-—something few
movies are utilizing nowadays.

Health inspector Matthew Ben-
nell (played by Donald Sutherland)
and Elizabeth (Brooke Adams) ﬁnd
there is more to her husband
Geoffrey’s coldness than meets the
eye.

Joined by psychologist-author
David Kubner (Leonard Nimoy)
and mudbath owner Bellecic (Jeff
Goldblum) and his wife (Veronica
Cartwright), the twosome struggles
against the unusually-emotionless
San Francisco community to prove
that ugly-looking pods are some-

how responsible.

W.D. Richter’s plot twists and
turns, and Michael Champan’s
(“Taxi Driver,” “The Last Waltz,”
“The White Dawn”) camera work
compliments the mysterious hap-
penings.

The movie is done differently
than its original, which pitted one
man against the evil pods and the
affected masses. The new “In-
vasion” is complete with costly
special effects—the pods travelling
through space to Earth,_the growth
of a human-like body skin layer by
skin layer, a crumbling dead
body—that seem to accompany

ENTERTAINMENT A

Seger Shines atArenaShow

By KEITH BRIAN

, Pitt News Staff Writer
On Dec. 29, more than 16,000
Pittsburghers went to the Civic

Arena to see if “Rock and Roll ,

Never Forgets,” Bob Seger style.
Seger’s Silver Bullet
Band burst on stage. playing that
tune.

With the microphone in hand,
Seger rested one foot on the
monitor in front of him when he
sang “Traveling Man” next.
Before going on to “Beautiful
Illusion,” Seger asked the audi-
ence, “Are you out there Pitts-
burgh?” A resounding roar
answered him.

With his right hand curled into a

,f1st above his head, Seger leaned

back on his heels, shook the
shoulder length hair from his face
and screamed “All the way to the
Super Bowl!” The resulting cheer
put the reigns of powerinto rock ‘n’
roll; “Old Time Rock and Roll,”

- that is.

Playing on words as well as city
pride, Seger introduced the tune,‘ ‘I
don’t know about you Pittsburgh.
But I ’Feel Like a Number’.”

The tempo then slowed when
Seger returned to the piano

bench. A soft melody cooled the
furor that had risen in the dome.

Two women entered stage right
and took places behind micropho-
phones for back-up vocals on “Still

The Same.” The air over the ﬂoor
had the electric-atomosphere that
usually permeates a concert, but
the spirit had not peaked’ and Seger
knew it.

Robyn Robbins had started the
set with a saxophone, then
switched to an acoustic six-string
for “Beauti ul Illusion,” but now
he held a trumpet as the band
started into their hit from the
summer “Main Street.”_ That
trumpet added a piece of extra
energy; the high notes sparked the
electricity into a positive ﬂow.

The music lifted and soothed
but the essence was in the poetry.

Seger’s calloused voice mesmeriz-
ed his followers with the phrase,
“Take it calmly and serene, It’s the

famous ﬁnal scene.”

The crack of thunderous ap-
plause brought an avalanche of
hard rock. The tune “Fire Down
Below” had Seger running from
one side of the stage to the other
beckoning the crowd to sing along.

Sixteen thousand livid Pitts-
burghers is dynamite, but the
chant, “Pittsburgh in the Super
-Bowl,” followed by “Rambling,
Gambling Man” let loose an
explosion that shook the wells in
Houston. This had becomeia pep
rally for the AFC Playoff that
followed the next day at Three
Rivers Stadium, and “Catmando”

was the last ﬁght song of the
concert.

Seger reappeared, armed with.

an acoustic twelve string for the
start of the encore. A minute
network of white spotlights en-
tangled the band on stage. The
strumming chords, revealed
“Night Moves.”

When he sang the words
“Summer Nights,” theroof be-
came a swirl of spinning lights.

Their source was two huge dance 

balls spinning in opposite direc-
tions. As the song wound down,
the spinning lights stopped.

After that spectacular display of

photons it seemed only ﬁtting that A

the next a song by “Hollywood
Nights."
building up steam for “You Cant
Stop'A Train.” Amidst changing
colors and solid rock, the saxo-
phone player left the stage. A
He started the chanting line,
“Shake it, baby, Shake it.” The
house grew dark again as the
intensity on the stage mounted».
Suddenly, four spotlights focused
on a spot halfway up the stands on
the stage left side of the arena.

Robbins stood amongst the/

crowd, and a circle of , smaller

’ spotlights encircled him. The

sweet tenor voice of the instrument
seeped through the cracks in the
ceiling warming Pittsburgh.

The tempo was rolling, .

every commercial “major” feature
movie.

But Kaufman wisely doesn’t let
the effects steal the show. Instead,
the actors and plot carry the
audience to the end, which seemed
to many in the audience like a very
bad joke.

The only problem with the movie
is that it dwells too much. on the
actual escape from San Francisco
by the group. Most of the
two-and—one-quarter hour film
shows the ﬁvesome being chased.

Setting up the mystery also takes
too long, but a careful viewer can
catch the subtle clues presented

Page 6—Wednesday, January 10, 1979

during that time—the offering of
plants as gifts, the continuous
presence of garbage trucks, the
missing minstrel—that contribute
to later action.

The movie even takes time to
make a social statement—the
comparison of the emotionless
victims and the life found on a strip
district the group passes while
escaping.

Despite its error of a little
over-explanation, “lnvasion of the
Body Snatchers” is a good artistic
effort. Even for a sequel.

Travolta Film Drags, ‘Moment by Moment’

John Travolta

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Pitt News Entertainment Editor

and he is constantly and flatteringly revealed in various

stages of undress.

There’s an old 1960’s movie relegated to an occasional

 

late late show called “The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone”
that dealt with an affair between an older woman and a
young man (Vivien Leigh and Warren Beatty) who looked
embarrassingly like mother and son and ended up with the
young man being exposed as a gigolo and the woman left
still older but wiser. A

Now, there is another young man-older woman romance
where the leads look even more embarrassingly like mother
and son but it features a 1970’s ending of happiness and
acceptance and forty carats worth of liberated blessings
because it's not only all right, but chic for older women to
have affairs with young men now.

But don’t use “Moment by Moment” as evidence. It
drags on, moment by moment. i

This ﬁlm has been proclaimed a triumph for that latest
screen cliche, the sensitive man, embodied by the screen's
hottest sensation, John Travolta. Teamed in an odd
coupling with Lily Tomlin, Travolta is the only point of
interest in “Moment by Moment."

Travolta portrays Strip, a young hustler who has starred
in porno flicks for quick money. Travolta's Strip is
sensitive: he is the character who stresses love and
commitment rather than Tomlin's Trisha, a bored Beverly

.Hi1ls matron who looks to be out for a few quick thrills.
Travolta’s strip, however,‘is what the cameras focus on

It’s hard to see what Strip sees in Trisha. She moves
about in a slow motion seconal stupor, speaking in a dull
monotone. .

It’s hard to see how the audience is supposed to believe
the affair, despite the passionate interest Travolta
manages to convey in a voice three octaves higher than
Tony Manero’s and Vinnie Barbarino’s.

The strong physical resemblance between Travolta and
Tomlin, from their unisex layered hairstyles on down, hurts
the credibility, and Tomlin Cuddles and caresses Travolta
like a negligent mother handling an infant rather than a
passionate lover.

Passion may be the key word why “Moment by
Moment” fails—Tomlin can’t match Travolta’s level and
apparently doesn’t try. She comes across like a missionary
or an evangelist, expressing a sort of detached zeal rather
than emoting. She played a similar role in “Nashville,"
and played it well, but the young man-older woman scenes
with Keith Carradine there were short and came to a
predictable ending. She doesn't have the power to carry
the theme through an entire picture.

But Travolta. high voice. exploiting body and all, gets his
point across. The problem is. Tomlin doesn't. so neither
does_j‘Moment by Moment."

It’s likely Pitt would whip Cincinnati at
basketball (Field House, 8 p.m.) no mat-
ter which of Tim Grgurich’s top eight or
nine players started, but his apparent
choice of freshman Dwayne Wallace to
replace Pete Strickland at first-string
guard tonight still is worthy of note.

Pitt’s pfoblems this season (at last),
have been found mainly in the closing
‘minutes of basketball games the team was

Wrap Up
L ycoming

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer

Lycoming head coach Budd
Whitehill found one word for his
wrestlers’ performance in their
25-8 loss to Pitt at the Field House
last night. .

“Terrible,” he smirked. . “No,
I’d better not say that. Sluggish—
that’s a better word. We looked
sluggish, not terrible.”

Panther head coach Dave Adams
was more pleased with his team,
which won its first dual meet» after
two losses.

“l was pretty well pleased,” he
said. “We- were scrappy,
aggressive. We went right after
the guy; we were right on top.”

Pitt jumped on the Warriors (1-1)
Quickly; 118-pounder Glenn Max-
well and 126—pounder Jose
Martinez each won. Maxwell
decisioned John O’Shea, 15-8, and
Martinez decisioned Russ Granato,
9-6.

After 134-pounder Jeff Gordon’s
7-5 loss to Rich Urmstead, the
Panthers swept the next three
bouts-142-pounder Seve Gouletas
decisioned Chris Shaner, 5-3,
150-pounder Ed Bredniak decision-
9-5, and
158-pounder Tom Jones super
superior-decisioned Mark Beier-
shmitt, 17-5, to give Pitt a 17-3
lead. I '

Skip Bolin, in his first 167-pound
match since a ﬁnger injury in a 5-5
tie against Eastern Wrestling
League champion Dom DiGioac-
chino, tied Tim Spruill, 5-5, to keep
the Panthers well ahead, 19-5. The
only other point-getting perfor-
mance for Lycoming was Ed
Allen’s 7-6 decision against Pitt
190-pounder Pat Connor.

Meanwhile, 177-pounder Jim
Gordon came from behind to edge
Chris Tremel, 4-3, and heavy-
weight Steve Smocharski ﬂattened
Dick Driver, 5-2.

“Talent was a big difference,”
Adams claimed. “The score
helped show it.” -

The Warriors, a Division III team

that finished ranked eighth last

season, had won their first match
against Kings College and placed
fourth at the Bloomsburg Invita-
tional, beating Virginia, Kutztown,
Duke and Morgan State, but such

statistics were little help to their
conditioning.

“We probably out-conditioned
them at this time,” Adams said.
“Our conditioning is at the point
where we anticipated it to be——
although it’s not where we hope to
get it.”

“Pitt’s young and looks like it’s
coming along,” Whitehill agreed.

The victory was the Panthers’
third straight against Lycoming,
including a 21-14 road victory a
year ago. All three wins occurred
immediately after Christmas break,
a dreaded vacation for head
coaches whose programs stress
conditioning.

‘ ‘We know that we’re not coming

.back from Christmas vacation in

great shape,” Adams said, “so this
is the match for us to get back into
shape.

“Not that Lycoming isn’t good.
Their team fights on the same level
with Bloomsburg, Lock Haven and
Clarion,” he added. “And that’s a
very good level to be on.”

Pitt’-s next match is Saturday at
Millersville, where the Marauders
have earned Division II’s number-
one ranking and much respect from
Division I teams.

' “Millersville’s got a good
team,” Adams said. “They should
be better than Lycoming.”

Men, Women Gymnasts Meet West

By KAREN KADILAK ‘
Pitt News Staff Writer

While injuries are not plagueing
Pitt’s men’s gymnastics team, the
women’s team will not be
completely healthy when it opens
its dual-meet season tonight
against West Virginia at Trees
Hall. But that doesn’t particularly
worry women's coach Donna
DeMarino Sanft. K

“I’d rather have our girls
recuperating from injuries now than
later in the season when we’re
peaking for the Eastern regionals
(championship)." Sanft said.

lnj ured are Myra Bachuchin (foot
surgery), Jill Morris (knee sur-

gery), Diane Debich (hand sprain),
and Roxanne Evans (ankle sprain).
All except Evans are doubtful for
tonight.

Because of the injuries, Pitt will
not have a full lineup, using four or
ﬁve girls in each event instead of
the ordinary six.

“Using four or five girls, we
can't afford to make any errors,”
Sanft explained. “When you have
six girls competing, you are
allowed to make two mistakes in
your routines.

“Having four. we can't make
any," Sanft continued. ‘‘It creates
extra pressure for the girls."

According to Sanft, Bonnie

Tressler and Holly Martino prob-
ably are the healthiest and most
consistent Pantherettes. Both will
compete in the all-around com-
petiton.

“We aren’t depressed or down
that some of our girls are injured,”
Sanft said. “None of the injuries
are serious enough that we should
feel that way.

“Our girls know we’re going to
be dynamite when we're healthy.
We aren't going to cry over spilled
milk. We have to maintain a
positive attitude.”

On the other hand, the men's
gymnastics team (0-1) is relatively
healthy. The Panthers also meet’

West Virginia tonight at Trees
Hall.

“We have a few injuries here
and there, but that’s to be expected
in a sport like this,” coach Frank
D’Amico said. “We’ll go with a full
lineup."

Pitt lost at Syracuse last month,
197.15-191.6, but D’Amico was
happy because his team set a new
team record for points scored.

“Later in the season, we
probably could have beaten them,”
D’Amico said of Syracuse. “We
had a lot of hard tricks we could
have used in our routines, but we
didn’t want to use them in our first
meet.”

 

 Swimmers

Dunk
Buckneﬂ

By CRIS HOEL \

Pitt News Sports Editor
Pitt’s swimmers raced past
Bucknell, 75-38, yesterday at Trees

Pool while seven teammates paid a '

one-meet’ penalty for missing a
weekend practice. The suspended
group, comprised mainly of the
team’s better swimmers, was not
missed much by the Panthers, who
cruised to victories in most events.

‘Two Panther freshmen each won .

a pair of races: Sandy Pigeon was
first in the 200-meter backstroke
and the 200-meter individual
medley and Rick Carter’s wins

7 came in the 50- and 100-meter

freestyles.

Sohpomore Jeff,Trew and junior
Dale Pﬂaumer ﬁnished one-two in
three events. The Panther/pair
won the 1,000-meter freestyle and
the meet’s next event, the
200-meter freestyle. A similar
ﬁnish later was the result of the
500-meter freestyle. '

Pitt also finished first and second
in both diving events.

Among those Panthers sus-
pended by coach Fred Lewis were
senior Mark Shuman and sopho-
mores Mickey Termin and Stu
Swanson. ,_

“All the guys who didn’t swifn
were good,” a Panther said, “but

Saturday’s practices were the straw
that broke the back. The coach had
warned us about missing practice
and he just decided to crack down
one day.”

That was Saturday and any
Panther who did not attend Lewis’
pair of practices that day was not
permitted to swim yesterday.

“I think it (the decision to
suspend) was good for us,” the
swimmer said. “We’re just

fortunate it came against someone‘

like Bucknell
anyway. ’ ’

 we killed them

Virginia

D’Amico believes the Panthers,
6-3 last season, will set yet another
school record for points scored.

“We're aiming for a score higher
than 191.6,” D’Amico said. “We
want to continue to improve our
scores. We hope to score 200 points
against Penn State Saturday.”

Leading the Panthers are soph-

(Continued from page 9)
Pitt’s followers because the team has
lost four (and blown three) games since
finals. W

Suspicion always is justified when a if

team finds leads difficult to protect,
and Pitt "certainly has been a “come-
from-ahead” team during recent years.
But it is too early, though Pitt has yet
to defeat an opponent that has had
home-court advantage, to be
dismayed. Pitt will win more basket;
ball games this season; the victories
even may be numerous.

Pitt will play at Fitzgerald Field
House 14 times this season. Only
Rutgers might be favored to beat Pitt
on the Panthers’icourt. And while
anyone betting with Pitt on the road

‘ should do his dribbling in a rubber

room, the Panthers might win a few of
their away-from-home dates.

This team could become a good one
as the season ages. It has the potential
and the statistics. What it needs now is
the performance. I

>Coaches are fond of saying foot-
ball games are won the field, but
Jackie Sherrill well may discover that
many can be won in a living room.

The particular living room is that
ofCentral Catholic quarterback Dan
Marino, one of the nation’s finest high
school throwers, who must be the most
important Pitt prospect since a 160-
pound runner from Hopewell High.

I Marino (6-4, 200) will make trips to
six schools. Pitt, Arizona State and

Michigan State seem to be the front-
runners in'fh/e race to become four-year
employer of Marino’s services. Pitt
was ahead of its rivals several weeks
ago, but its lead is not so sure now.
Clemson, UCLA and Florida, which
Marino also will "visit, are said to be
out of the bidding.

How good is Marino? The Pit-
tsburgh Press names a local most
valuable high school player each year
and this year’s choice was not clear-
cut. Several players performed better
than Marino this season, but his ability
made him a candidate for the award.

A similiar situation occured in 1973,
when a pair of players, each of whom
attended Pitt, were considered for the
award. It went to the player who, ac-

/’

cording to the judges, had a better
year. His name was Mark O’Toole.
The overlooked, but more talented
player, was Tony Dorsett.

So Dan Marino was named most
valuable player by the Press recently,
“It had to go to him,” said. a Press
sportswriter. “I didn’t want to read in
four years that I’d passed over a guy
who won a "Heisman Trophy. And
Marino could. ,

Marino alsocould play quarterback
for Pitt soon. UCLA, Arizona State
and Clemson, each of whom were bet-

ter than Pitt this Past season, told_

Marino he would start as a freshman.
jackie Sherrill probably would not
promise Marino a first—year job, but he
just as probably would think about it.

Pantherette
Hoop Record
Now 4-8

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The women’s basketball team
evened its regular season record at
2-2 after its 61-55 loss to
Northwestern University, the
team’s second straight defeat on
the road. The Pantherettes have
struggled through their last three
weeks of play beginning with a
sixth-place ﬁnish in the North
Carolina Invitational Tournament
over the holidayibreak.

The Pantherettes lost star guard
Debbie Lewis with a broken foot
she received in a game against
Charleston. Head Coach Jean
Balthaser discussed the problem of
ﬁlling Lewis’ spot in the lineup.

“When a team loses it’s starting
guard it can be a major loss
because of the control she assumes
over the team.” said Balthaser.
“We are still looking for someone
to ﬁll the job so we are trying out a
number of different players. So far
we are using Kathy Paczkowski,
Peg Dugan and Dana Elder, with
Paczkowski having the"'edge.” _

In Saturday's game with North-
western and Pantherettes were
able to come within three points

. with 28 seconds remaining when
they scored 10 straight unanswered
points. Despite the strong effort,
the Pantherettes had to resort to
fouling to try to gain control of the
ball. This failed and Pitt lost.

Pitt's Carol Dugan and Wanda
Randolph, who played much of the
game in foul trouble, were high
scorers with 14 a piece and
Paczkowski rounded out the double
ﬁgure scoring with 10. Randolph
was high for the Pantherettes in
rebounding, pulling down 13.

The Pantherettes ﬁnd them-
selves struggling with an overall
4-8 record and approaching the
toughest part of their season when
they return home tonight to face La
Salle.

The Pantherette coach is opti-
mistic about tonight’s contest.

“We have been playing well in
spots and the girls are starting to
move the ball a lot better. We must
concentrate on our turn-overs in
the games ahead,” Balthaser said.

“We are at the point now where
we aren’t very consistent in our
play,” she added, “although our
defense has managed to keep us in
the ball game when our offense
hasn’t been very productive.

“We believe that the slump we
are in right now can be helped by
playing on our own court, so we are
anticipating being at home against
La Salle."

The Pantherettes will be able to
ﬁnd out how much luck their home
court can bring tonight at the Field
House in a game prior to the men's
game against Cincinnati.
