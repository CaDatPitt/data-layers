Kipling to the contrary, East met West Tuesday night
at the opening of “International Capers”~ and every show
and booth made the twain. —

I Breezy gusts of wind and near freezing temperatures

'couldn’t keep the crowds away, and for a few cents you

could dunk a_ shivering politico in a tub of water or ﬁnd out
how the other half lives- in any part of the world. If you
were cold, and who wasn’t you‘ could buy a hot chocolatif
or a crisp cup of independent french fries. Cute lassies-in
one booth kept lads from getting teed off when they didn't
get the golf -ball in the hole and equally cute misses in an-
other booth posed prettily for those who wanted to toss
rings.‘ _
One of the outstanding things about the shows, which
are -near" professional, is the chorus lines. The girls give
their routines a snap and precision that puts the productions
abpve many TV numbers. - ,

You don’t have to spend $20,000 for a world tour, just
spend a ‘few cents tonight—the closing night——and you’ll
ﬁnd yourself in the middle of. a world carnival that looks
like the United Nations’ annual picnic. ‘

The ten shows havetravel folder fronts, but like the
travel folders you have to get inside to ﬁnd out what it is
all about. .For the skeptics, here is a short summary of
the shows and booths as we saw them:

BEDLAM~ IN BAGDAD——-A fast-6

the boys are ably assisted by a
bevy of chorus girls. The shadow
dance shows an unexpected or-
iginality to an already original
show. (Zeta Tau Alpha, Kappa

“FRENCH FRIED” -— Strictly
from the “Left Bank” with color-
ful artists, scantily-clad can-can
gals and provocative dancers.
Good balance of music with plot
that revolves around “Lucky
Pierre” and life in Paris as it
should be. Artists, dancers and
chorines are lively, luscious and
bosomy. (Alpha Epsilon Phi and
Delta Tau Delta.)

“COME” BACK ‘LITTLE
PAISAN” —- Fast moving, good
dialogue with real quality in danc-
ing and singing to. set lively tempo.
Comedy team adds good touch
with enough slap-stick to add rio-
tous climax. Sinooth orchestra-
tions ﬁne for accompaniment and
background? (Theta Phi Alpha, Al-
pha Phi Delta.)

“SOVIET SCANDALS’v’——Clever-‘
ly 'cpnSt;‘uc_te.d satire on the Red

for fans of Jackie Gleason. Good
phonomimicry and a surprise end-
ing keeps the audience laughing.
(Kappa Kappa Gamma, Pi Kappa

TONGO——A change of pace from
the" usual other shows. Uses off-
stage narration and a Hollywood
plot to achieve desired effect. Out-
standing ballet dancer and voca-
list. (Chi Omega, Delta Sigma

HOLY COW——Opens with, an
exchange of patter and continues
to amuse with broad humor. Come
with a sour face and you’ll leave
laughing, but come with your
grandmother and you’ll leave be-

CHILE CON CARNEY——A Span-

of spicy dancing and saltyhumor
combine to-make this solid fare.

Coach Red Dawson, in his third year ashead coach here,

Mittmen Risk 5-Game ''
Win Streak at Juniata

Pitt’s high-geared baseball nine will be seeking their

Debaters Out-Talk Four

The team of Dan Levitt and
Hershal Taxey was named the best
two-man team at the Fourth An-
nual Tech Tartan Debate Tourna-

ment recently, after out—talking
four other college teams.

Levitt and Taxey are both soph-
omores in the College. This is their
ﬁrst major tournament triumph.
Taxey placed fourth in a tourna-
ment at Arizona State earlier this
year. -

Probably not. As far as we know, there isn’t such a term.
Even so, the terrain of a manufacturing plant may have
a vital eifect on the design and location

ing equipment.

It certainly did in the case of our Belle, West Virginia,
plant, which is just across the road from a ﬂat-topped

hill, 750 feet high.

-Perhaps you’d like to match wits with Du Pont engi-
v neers, for we feel that this problem was interesting-—

and its solution ingenious.

Brieﬂy‘, the situation was this: Carbon dioxide was to
be removed from a mixture of gases by bringing them
into contact with water in “scrubbers” operating at 450
psi (gauge).The inlet gases contained about 25% CO2

While prices seem to be going up
on just about everything these
days, Pitt Players has announced a
s p e c i a 1 performance of “Yes
M’Lord,” their newest production,
with tickets selling for 50 ,cents,
' one-half the regular price.

This preview performance, open
to all Pittstudents, will be held
Thursday evening, May 13.

For the other plays presented
this season, preview performances
held on Thursday evenings were
open‘ only to designated campus
organizations. This arrangement
was made as an incentive to en-
large the size of the audiences and

tions.

Now, because of a very success-
ful season which saw more than

1,000 people who attended “The

economical closed system for this scrubbing water‘? After
you’ve thought out your solution, you might like to
, compare it with the one given

,-

Du Pont engineers made use of the precipitous te -

rain in this way: pressure on the water leaving the
scrubbers was sufﬁcient to force it up to the top of the

. hill for CO2 recovery. The returning Water thereby pm-

by volume. Because of its greater solubility, most of the
CO2 would leave the scrubbers dissolved in the water.

It was necessary to reduce the pressure of this water
to atmospheric and recover the dissolved carbon'dioxide,;_
since CO2 was needed for use in a chemical synthesis.
The degasiﬁed Water then had to be pumped back into

the pressure‘ scrubbers, to repeat the scrubbing cycle.

energy saving. ’

Do unusual problems such as this one challenge you
and stir your enthusiasm? If they do, we think you’ll be
interested in technical work with the Du Pont Company.
