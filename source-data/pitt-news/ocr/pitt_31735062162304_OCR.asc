ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER

WASHINGTON AP--The White
House informed the House Ju-
diciary Committee Tuesday it
wants to wait until after the Easter
recess of Congress before deciding
how to respond to a committee
request for tapes of 42 presidential

' conversations.

James D. St. Clair, President
Nixon’s defense éounsel in the
impeachment inquiry being con-
ducted by the committee, indicated
in a letter that additional materials
would be furnished after Congress
returns from its Easter holiday in
April 22 that “will permit the
committee to complete its inquiry
promptly.” V _

The committee had set a
Tuesday deadline for a reply to its
request for the tapes. But a White
House official, who declined to be
quoted, insisted the only thing
expected of St. Clair was to spell
out at this ‘time how the White
House\ intended to go about
considering the request.

In a letter to committee special
counsel John M. Doar. St. Clair
said Nixon “has directed me to
advise you that a review of the
materials in‘ question is under
way." The letter continued:

“We expect that the review can
be completed by the end of the
Easter reeess,‘and that the
additional materials furnished at

Proposed For  

Pgh. Government

BY CAL RITCHEY

The city's government would be
more effective if the proposed
“home rule" system is adopted by
voters in November. according to
Ben Havller, Consultant on Public
Information for Pittsburgh's Gov-
ernment Study Commission.-

Pittsburgh is currently governed
by the state legislature under laws
dating from 1886, Hayller said.
These laws give the state the right
to make certain decisions which
affect only Pittsburgh, such as
establishment of city departments.
or taxation. Havller noted.

“For example, under our present
system the city cannot raise
taxes,” he said, “The city must‘ go
to the state and ask permission.
The city cannot invest excess funds
in stocks and bonds, or form a
Department of Transportation--one
of our pressing problems at the
moment.

Democratic   Party Sweeps

Pitt's Vote Registration

BY BILLHADUCK

Student disgust with Watergate
and the Republican party in
general was responsible for a
Democratic party sweep of Wed-
nesday's voter registration at Pitt.
according to College Young Demo-
crats (CYD) President John Rohe.-
“‘Democratic registration on
campus had always been higher
than Republican,” Rohe said, “But
now we outnumber the Republi-
cans eight to one. Obviously
students are getting more aware of
problems in government like
Watergate and therefore see an
opportunity to get involved in a
clean-up _iob.

“The Democrats are also saying
things the students agree with.
Shapp is against capital punish-
ment and he wants to raise
assistance to the poor."

College Young Republicans
(CYR) Secretary Alexis Sullivan
said her organization had expected
the minimal Republican registra-
tion. “We're not surprised."
Sullivan said. ‘

She said, however, it was not the
Republican party per se the
students were reacting against.
“The Republican philosophy itself
is not repulsive,” Sullivan said,
“it's the highest levels that have
done the damage to their party.”

Exact figures were 191. Democrat

Rohe attributed the relatively

reservations about the measure

he was signing it because “raising
the minimum wage is now a matter
of iustice that can no longer be
fairly delayed."

The measure raises the mini-
mum wage for 36 million workers
covered under the 1966 minimum
wage law from $1.60 to. $2.00. on

The Monroeville Times-Express
is switching from weekly to daily

created by the strike which has no
end in sight. “We have no idea
how long it willibe," the Press
source‘ said. ’

According to published reports,
Teddy Kozza, president of the
striking local, said the union was

_prepared to stay out six months to
back its demands for a new
contract.

But, he added. the legislation

good than bad and I have
concluded that the best interests of
American people will be served by

The last legislation raising the
minimum wage was enacted eight
years ago.

The additional coverage goes to S ,

employes, 1 million. domestics and
additional retail store employes.
service industry employes and farm
workers.

The minimum wage increases

Pgh. ‘Home Rule’ Proposed

(Contizzzzerl from Page 1)
Havller said. “First. there is
something wrong when a repre-
sentative of say. Lackawanna
County. in the other end of the
state, must -rule on a problem
which involves only Pittsburgh.
Second. these local issues. should
be debated in Pittsburgh. not in
Harrisburg." _

The city's present governmental
structure——a "strong mayor—coun-
cil." according to Hayller--would
be basically unchanged if home
rule is adopted, he said.

“Pittsburgh would continue to
have a strong mayor-council
set-up,” Hayller said. “The new
government, however, as the Study
Commission envisions it, would

incorporate a large number of good

government laws.

“For example. five days before
an election all candidates would
report campaign contributions. All

"elected officials would have to

disclose their ﬁnancial interest--not
the amount of interest, iust the
interest--in any corporation. Both
of these measures would help
prevent conflict of interest.

"Community advisory boards
would be set up which would give
city neighborhoods the right to
elect an advisor who would work
with the city on problems affecting
that particular neighborhood."
Hayller said.

“For example, if there was a
problem with zoning, garbage
pickup, police or fire protection. or
anything else, these neighborhood
officials could represent theii
neighborhoods with a direct line to
city officials.

“The West End is one example
of this." he added, “Of the nine
city councilmen who now help

govern Pittsburgh. and who are
elected at large fromthe city. one is
from the South Side. one from the
North Side. and the rest all live
between the rivers. These
neighborhood representatives
could help these outlying neigh-
borhoods with some of their
problems which we never hear
about."'

Allegheny County is also facing a
similar referendum on May 20,
according to the League of Women
Voters’ Marilyn Prouty. Like

Pittsburgh, the County is currently
governed by the state legislature.

If home rule is adopted. the three
county commissioners who are
presently responsible for governing

the county would be replaced by an '

elected county executive and by
seven county representatives elec-
ted by district. Prouty said.

According to Pennsylvania law.
,ifeither'referendum is defeated. it
cannot be resubmitted for five
years. -

Univ. Starts New Bulletin

out,” Coble said, “We’re going to
try to get out ‘information on a
timely basis and it’s to be brief,
basic information.

“It's not designed." he contin-
ued. "to supplant any other
periodical. Its not a question of
the University Times not being of
value. the Pitt Update is envisoned
as a periodic thing to get news out
which has an immediate value."

Coble said each issue will be
printed on a necessity basis. and
the Update will not be a regular
issue. but will be available to any
department which needs to imme-

diately clarify issues or informa-‘

tion.

‘,‘It can be useful in a situation
where there is a lot of speculation
and it’s not a question of putting
out a biased opinion, or an editorial
statement,” Coble said.

Coble said funding for Pitt
Update is coming from the News
and Publications Department allo-
cation‘, which normally handles
University information processing.

Director of News and Publica-
tions Joesph Colangelo estimated,

cost per publication of Pitt Update
as $150 per printing.

‘‘I don’t think the distribution

amounts to anything. We are using
the regular mailroom crew. No one
is hired speciﬁcally for putting the
Pitt Update out, we just have an
editor who does a couple of other
things also.

“Apparently people felt a need
for a publication which could be
distributed in a matter of hour and
was college-wide." Colangelo said.

Colangelo characterized Pitt
Update as a “Bulletin board in
print.” _

The current issue of Pitt Update
carries a story about the appoint-
ment of Dr. Thomas J. Galvin as
Dean of the Graduate School of
Library and Information Sciences.

When asked why this appoint-
ment necessitated an issue of the
Update, Colangelo said he was not
in a position to make a determina-
tion. .
Coble said the appointment was
long-awaited by the campus

community, and therefore was
deemed important enough for
publication.

Tuition Process‘Simplifed In Student Accounting

In an effort to save time for our student customers, we are testing a new
invoice payment system this term. The University wants to keep the lines
short, save time for students with simple transactions, and give expert
direction to students with problems. There will still have to be thousands
of transactions processed during the first due date of the term, but with
a little cooperative effort we will be able to better serve the students.

As you can see from the diagram, we would like to have incoming stu-
dents use the Forbes and Bellefield entrances on April 10 and 11. All
students should go directly to the Student Accounting Information

Checkpoint counter in the central ground floor lobby of the Cathedral of

If the bill, aid/loan certificates and checks equal the amount due on the
invoice it can be put in an envelope and deposited, provided the student
is sure about his bill, documents, or check. No cash in the mailbox,
please. These will be processed and paid copies/validation certificates

Students who have not previously picked up aid certificates will be able
to get them near this checkpoint. From this point students with cash pay-

Urban Studies Relief

V Despite the administration’s public relations commitment to the
 studies program, the urban studies major_ is being stiﬂed in its
'1-“attempt-to grow into what could be an academically sound program.
"Urban studies instructors recently submitted a budget proposal to
i‘Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome Rosenberg. They requested
7*funding for a senior faculty member to direct the major, the
~’;appointment of a full time advisor, and increased faculty relief time
Zfromiacadernic departments.
I jVRosenberg granted only the funding necessary for an academic
advisor because of the tight budget situation. Participants in the urban
‘studies program, both students and_ faculty members, contend the
 studies program cannot function effectively with only an
academic advisor.
Presently all urban studies faculty volunteer their time and efforts to
‘sustain this program.
I To fully develop into a worthwhile curriculum, however, the urban
studies program desperately needsassistance by way of increased
.fau|lt_y time especially from senior faculty.
It is unfair to urban studies students for the University to supply only
junior faculty to operate the program--junior faculty who by nature
"must spend considerable time seeking tenure.
This decision by Rosenberg is yet one more indication of the
University's unwillingness to fulﬁll its commitments to the students.
7 Five years ago the University established the urban studies major as
an example of relevant urban education. Today the University claims it
is ﬁnancially incapable of promoting an- adequate urban studies
program.
 Furthermore, the urban studies program has become the public
relations ploy of the administration. Only when it suits their purpose
‘does the administration boast of their great efforts to provide relevant
education to_ the students of an urban campus. Yet when the time
comes to indicate the sincerity of that commitment in terms of money,
Pitt falls far short of providing adequately for an/urban studies major.
We urge Dean Rosenberg to consider his decision. The University
_  should be able to ﬁnd money to continue a worthwhile and relevant
17  academic program.
Furthermore we urge the chairmen of the social science departments
 to dedicate themselves to the promotion of an adequate urban studies
 program. Only a program which receives the full support of the
 chairmen can succeed in providing relevant urban education at Pitt.

Supporting Arsenal

Two weeks ago this newspaper urged all those in positions ‘to
encourage the continued existence of the Arsenal Center in
 Lawrenceville to maintain the worthwhile community service and
., progressive educational program, yet it is apparent that demand has
 gone unheralded. ' '
 The Center provides practical training for Pitt students who work in
;‘.{the child care program and Pitt faculty members use Arsenal as a
, research area. Eight schools and departments in the University are
 served by the Arsenal Center. . .

The University has not yet reconsidered its decision to withdraw
 faculty and staff support nor its refusal to provide the sufﬁcient amount
ijof funds needed to maintain Arsenal’s operations for the ﬁscal year
; V’74-’75. And it is apparently clear the administration has no immediate
7 plans to reconsider this unfortunate decision.

_ P The Pitt News also urged the Student Government Board, the
 representatives of the students, to petition the University to resolve
9 this issue. The SGB has not been responsive to this request.
 However, the Board will meet publicly tonight. According to Mike
« Furick, ASG President, the Arsenal issue will be on the agenda. We
' must urge our student government representatives again to support
 the efforts of the Arsenal Center to rnaintain_ its operations. They
 should petition the University administration to continue its association
 * with Arsenal in order to prevent the closing of a valuable research
3 75 center.

 Once again we are compelled to state unequivocally that the
 University has a moral responsibility to maintain the existence of the
‘ . Arsenal Center.

‘Toward Impeachment

Though President Nixon has proclaimed his intention to provide the

, 9 House Judiciary Committee with the necessary infomiaion to complete

Swan Song

George Zrust’s Last Hurrah

BY GEORGE ZRUST
Sooner or later, all of us must sing
a swan song. This is mine.
After almost two years of writing
—a column (and also doing some

. reporting) for the Pitt News, my

time has run out. Graduation
looms in the near future, and I
(sniff) must say goodbye to the
University of Pittsburgh, and all
associated with it.

There are many ways a writer
can say goodbye to his readers: he
can cry, and be sickly sentimental,
saying how much he loved his job
and his faithful audience. But
newsprint is cheap enough paper to
begin with, and tears only rot it
faster.

Or the writer can bathe himself
in self-esteem, pointingout all that
his powerful commentaries have
accomplished. This I would like
very much to do, if I could do it
honestly. On to the next
alternative. " _,

Or, among the many other ways
a writer can bow out, he can lean
back and pontiﬁcate. I think I’ll
pontiﬁcate.

I must ﬁrst of all admit that the
whole experience of being an
commentator has been interesting
indeed, if for no other reason than
to seevhow really stupid so many

  Letters

Urban Studies

Dear Editor:

It has been the normal course of
events at the University where a
commitment is made to students
but never followed through, or
even worse, where a commitment
is started but then dropped after a
period of time.

The most recent example of this
is the dilemma of the Urban
Studies Program. The commitment
first came from Chancellor Posvar
when he announced (through
media, such as the Pitt Magazine)
that one of. the University's goals
was the fulﬁllment of its “urban
mission." This commitment was
made more speciﬁc when» the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS)
voted to institute the Urban Studies
Program as a major. One would
normally assume that, if the FAS
were interested enough to institute
the major, they would have
provided the means by which the
program could function efficiently.

With the Urban Studies major,
this is not the case. In the ﬁve
years of its existence, it has not
received funding from the FAS. No
amount of rationalization can
excuse this breach of commitment.

We. of the College of Arts and
Sciences Student Cabinet feel that
the University (particularly the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences) must
follow through on its responsibility
to the Urban Studies majors. It is
imperative that the Urban Studies
major remain a credible program.
Only through FAS support will this
be possible.

Sincerely,
William Voharas, Chairman
CAS Student Cabinet

The Zinger

Dear Editor:
With the‘ school year drawing to

people are.

I speak of the letters I have
gotten, reacting to pieces I have
written, and in one particular
instance, a cartoon that-I drew.

In a sense, I “attacked" these
people or groups. But it was not an
attack ("self-esteem, again) in the
respect that I ruined lives or
damaged reputations--it was mere-
ly that I pointed out some dumb
move or two by the subjects.

Apparently it is sacreligious to
do so.

I don’t make claims of the fine
deeds done by my writing. The
people I speak of continue to do
the same stupid things, and no
amount of criticism in ink will
change them. But at least I made a
few defend themselves in ways that
proved exactly what I had said.

V Even though I have touched on
many subjects in the last two years,
there are many I have not covered,
naturally. Therefore, hoping
perhaps someone else will be able
to use some suggestions for column
topics, I pose the following
questions:

Why has the University chosen
to ‘waste so much money on
something as totally useless as the
football team? To bring “honor
and glory” to Pitt? To build a few

strong bodies a few expensive
ways? To satisfy nostalgic alumni
who still live in the days of Jock
Sutherland?

Also, why does the University
give students such a hard time
when it comes to paperwork? Is it
fun to cancel a student's registra-
tion and frustrate him or her by
seeing how many ofﬁces the
student can visit and how many
times he or she can be laughed at
by mannerless Pitt employees?.
“Veritas Et Virtus," is the slogan.
And lastly, why did Szabo

administrators give me such a _

run-around when I asked about the
prices of their so-called hambur-
gers? Are you by any chance
allergic to soy bean?

Every Szabo person I talked to
during this fall, 1973 encounter
contradicted the other in some way.

Does Szabo discriminate against
people who aren’t shifty-eyed? Or
is it merely true that everybody in
charge of the University food
service is so crooked that he or she
can’t sleep in a straight bed?

Enough, though.‘ I only hope
that my loyal readers (bless every
one of your 17 souls) will continue
to look for me. I’ll turn up
somewhere.

I promise.

To The Edﬁori

an end. we feel it is about time that
somebody says something in
defense of George Zrust and his
articles. For as long as he has been
writing for the Pitt News, he has
regularly been the object of sharp
criticism and disgusting attacks by
a bunch of literary know-nothings.

Frankly, we do not understand
this. His essays are refreshing,
witty, and thought-provoking, and
we look forward to each issue for
more of his fine work. Granted, at
times it seems he must surely be
scraping the barrel for topics to
write about, but then one must
make allowances for liberal arts
majors.

Keep zinging it at ’em, George!
We, for two, are behind you. '

Pseudonyms

Dear Editor, _

The April Fool’s issue of the Pitt
News caused comment at many
levels, some favorable, and some
not (as the letter which appeared
April 3). I am not writing to pass
judgement on the journalism, or
the humorous effort behind it, but
rather to register a small com-
plaint.

The use of ﬁctitious names by
your writers for‘ the sake of
anonymity in respect to the
material published was an under-
standable act, but one author in
particular which caused conside-I
rable comment in the previously
published letter is of specific
interest to me. “Lois Lane's"
questionably humorous account of
the sinking of Benedum Hall
evoked quite an argument from
Mr. Buzonas, some of it personally
orientated. My complaint? Just
this.

I write for the Magic Bus, Pitt's
commuter newspaper published
bi-monthly, and in every issue

printed so far this year, I have _‘

. /,

submitted at least one article under
the “nome de plume" of Lois Lane.

This ﬁctitious name. being quite
similar to my own, has up to this
point been exclusively utilized in
campus publications by myself.
Though I am not staking claim to
the rights to use it, I would like to
clarify that the Lois Lane of the Pitt
News and that of the Magic Bus are
two separate people‘.

The many comments that have
been directed my ‘way about the
article I supposedly wrote for your

paper have promoted this letter of

explanation. lam anxious to clear
my name of any implications that
the article, with its ﬁctitious
author, would carry. Please be
more selective of your writer's
anonymities when the next" April
Fool’s issue is compiled.

Thank you,

Stupidity.

To the Editor:

I fully agree with M.C. Pilecki's
criticism of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences with
respect to the Best Foreign Picture
category. The rule of having this
year's foreign ﬁlma nominations
ineligible for competition in other
areas is totally ridiculous, pointless
and, at times, confusing. Day For
Night, this year's Best Foreign
Film was definitely the best picture
of the year--“in any language,"
but was prevented from being
nominated in other categories by
this stupid rule of eligibility. As
Pilecki pointed out, this ruling
“emphasizes Hollywood's image
_as backwoods provincials who fail
to understand what is outside their
backyard."

The announcement of Arsenal’s
closing caused an onslaught of
citizen protest in the Lawrenceville
district. Parents wrote individual
letters to the Chancellor stressing
the center’s importance to the
community. The school’s Mother’s
Committee recently finished col-
lecting letters from the children to
Posvar telling of their feelings for
the school and asking him not to
close it.

Several mothers expressed frus-
tration regarding their efforts to
keep the center open.

can't seem to penetrate his
(Posvar's) wall. There's been so
much community response and it
has had so little impact," Hartge
said.

The parents have not given up
the battle yet. however, and their
‘loyalty to the school remains as
intense as their childrens'.

“There is no other place like it.
If it closes there is just no other
pre-school or kindergarten where I
could send my kids that would
compare to it.” If the school does
close, Hartge says_she’ll keep her
children at home. . “I’ve learned a
lot from my contact with the center
and I know I could do a better job
than some of these other day-care
centers...so many of them are only

babysitters.”
Aside from the service Arsenal
provides to the children and

parents it also serves as a training
center and demonstration model.

Graduate students from several
Pitt professional schools have
practicum placements at Arsenal.
In addition, data for masters and
doctoral theses is often gathered at
the center.

Tittnich feels the loss of the
center's training component is
equal to the loss the parents and
children will suffer.

‘Papillon’ Finally Opens

McQueen.

BY M. C. PILECKI

Don't believe movie hype. An ad
campaign is usually expected to
glorify a film's assets and forget
its faults. Butonce in a while, after
you finally do see the current
greatest movie ever made, you
walk out of the theatre mumbling,
“they advertised the wrong flick."

It happens. A movie’s publicity
will be so far removed from what
the film is really about that you
begin to think the studio’s ad
department is plugging the wrong
thing. Take Papillon for example.
From the hype you may think it’s
an escape story, a colossal
adventure starring Steve McQueen
and Dustin Hoffman.

Wrong.

Sure, there isan escape adventure
but it’s only part of the story. And
Steve McQueen is certainly the
star, but why Hoffman shares top
billing- is something more easily
explained by the guy’s salary than
his secondary role in the film.

The film is a sometimes gripping
biographical account of Henri
Charriere‘s best-selling autobio-
graphy of his escape from the 19305
French penal colony in Guiana. His
nickname, “Papillon” (butterﬂy in
French) derived from his striking

determination to live free or not at
all.

McQueen is a natural for this role.

He made his name portraying the
defeated, maligned rebel who
refuses to give up in the face of
hardship, logic or sanity. His name
is carved in box office lights by
doing the strong and silent bit in
fighting and usually losing against
any and all forms of authority. from
a reproaching step-mother [Baby,
the Rain Must Fall] to Nazi POW
camp officers [The Great Escape].
And the few times he truly wins.

especially sweet, and a reafﬁrma-
tion that there is some justice in a
wretched world.

He etched the character so well it
became mated with his off-camera
image [or was it the other way
around?l so that a McQueen
"performance didn’t seem like
acting. Perhaps, but even at his
most unimaginative he was never
dull, riding motorcycles over
barbed-wire fences or careening
through the streets of San
Francisco, all with the same moody
expression in his steely blue eyes,

rounded out by an almost stock set
of mannerisms.

This is the McQueen playing the
title role in Papillon, but with
greater depth and power than one
would have thought possible from
him. All the favorite mannerisms
are there, the overwhelming screen
presence is there in Papillon but in
addition there's an underlying,
infatiguable strength of a man who
will not forsake his freedom nor his
honor despite all possible physical
persecutions.

The most outstanding sequence is
his first stretch in solitary
confinement. the ‘result of an
aborted escape attempt prompted
by his rescuing a fellow prisoner.
McQueen’s superhuman survival
of inhuman punishment, reduced
to eating insects to stave off
starvation, is an absorbing, stellar
portrayal of proud human suffering
unshaken in principles.

This is deﬁnitely McQueen’s
finest performance to date, and it’s
strange that it will not have a
chance to garner him ‘his first
Oscar. Unfortunately, this apex of
his career occurs in what otherwise

NRA Cites Constitution Against Gun Control

BY TOM VERBISH
“Guns ..don't kill, people do."

 said Richard Makovich, a 15-year

member of the National Riﬂe
Association (NRA). Makovich, a
loan officer at a local bank in West
Newton, 27 miles southeast of
echoed a sentiment

Despite this claim however, guns

 ‘dd kill. At a rate of nearly 20,000
‘ Americans a year.

Yet the prospect of Congress
passing an effective gun-control

 bill appears remote.

Since the assassination of Pres-

 ident John F. Kennedy in 1963,
‘Congress has only enacted the
 restrictions ofthe 1968 Gun Control

Act which, despite the controls
“long guns." riﬂes,
shotguns and mail order guns,
experts claim.has failed to cope

I with the problem of handguns.

The National Commission on the
Causes and Prevention of Violence
has reported handguns are invol-
ved in 75% of all gun killings,
although they account for only 25%
of all privately owned ﬁrearms in

if the country.

“Most killings are the result of

 , disputes between people acquaint-

 

ed with each other." said Franklin

E. Zimring, director of the
commission where spontaneous
violence is generated and the

weapon is used to win a ﬁght or
wreak vengeance or iniury, whe-
ther or not this means that death
will result...

“There are exceptions to this
pattern-—coldblooded assassina-
tions that are beyond any weapons
control--but the great maioritv of
homicides, and the bulk of the
recent increases in homicide, are
precisely the kind of killings that
can be sustantially reduced by
getting guns out of the hands of
potential attackers." B

Opponents of gun control cite the
Second Amendment of the US
Constitution, which declares: “A
well-regulated militia being neces-
sary to the security of a free state,
the right of the people to keep and
bear arms, shall not be infringed.”

Traditional anti-gun control ar-
guments claim people have the
right to bear arms for pleasure and
self-protection without government
interference. criminals will get
guns despite gun controls, all gun
control proposals--whether they
advocate registration, licensing,

It's new.. It's original.

record keeping, or anything else-—
arc_ undesirable because they will
lead inevitably to other more
restrictive measures.

Maxwell E. Rich, former execu-
tive vice president of the NRA, said
in a Newsweek interview, “The
District of Columbia has had a
registration requirement of all
firearms since 1968. In 1971, the
Metropolitan Police Department
recovered 3.908 handguns, ap-
proximately 96% of which were
unregistered.

“There is no problem caused by
the handgun in the hands of 99% of
the people, but to eliminate the
handgun...in a hope of eliminating
it from the 1% criminal element--
which is already prohibited from
possession of any firearms under
existing Alaws--is punishing. the
wrong party.” ‘

Long-time gun control advocate
Senator Edward M. Kennedy
(D-Mass.) is convinced gun regu-
lations can work to reduce the
misuse of firearms.

“Strict gun restrictions will aid
in disarming any who fail to

register their weapons or obtain a

license for ownership,"';Kennedv
said recently in a Senate address.
' “Indeed, the enforcement of
licensing and registration laws
serves to isolate precisely those
citizens who flout the law.

“For enactment of such legisla-
tion makes it a crime _merely to
possess an unregistered firearm.
Commission of a crime with such a
weapon compounds the wrong of
any illegal act."

The failure of the federal
government to act decisively on
gun control can be directly tied to

\....u......

the NRA, which has often served as
the national gun lobby.

The NRA numbers more than a
million dues-paying members and
draws additional support from the
country’s 21 million hunters and an
estimated 60 million households
which have guns.

It was founded in 1871 by some
officers of the New York National

, Guard, distressed by the ineptitude

of Northern riflemen during the
Civil War. _

The Association operates out of
Washington where it employs a
staff of 250, maintains communica-
tions with 11,500 affiliated clubs,
works on programs in marksman-
ship and firearms safety, plans and
sponsors thousands of annual
shooting tournaments.’ and pub-

lishes the magazine, American
Rifleman.
As the governing body of

competitive rifle and pistol shoot-
ing in the US, the NRA sponsors
the National Matches, a maior
annual tournament for gunmen.
Because of its semi-official

‘status, the Association also selects

the rifle and pistol teams who
represent the US in the World
Olympics and the Pan-American

. games.

The NRA is backed by assets of
$19 million and an annual budget of
almost $8 million.

Sturn-Ruger, Daisy] and gun
dealers [New York’s Abercrombie
& Fitch, Interarmco in Virginia],
which do an estimated annual
business of $1.5 billion,” according
to US Representative Michael
Harrington [D--6th District, Mass.]

According to a recent article in
the Nation, “The gun industry's
financial support is essential to the
NRA. since 22% of the.NRA's
annual income flows from manu-
facturer and dealer advertising in
American Riﬂeman," he argued.

By using its enormous following
and resources. the NRA has been
successful -in blocking all federal
legislation calling for the registra-
tion and licensing of privately
owned guns. With its encour-
agement, gun enthusiasts flood
Congress with protests every time
firearms restrictions come up.

American Rifleman, in an article
reviewing the 1970 elections,
began by quoting Maryland's
Joseph Tydings. a spokesman for
control who had iust lost his fight
for re-election’ to the Senate, as
saying, “I suppose this will
discourage others from taking on
the gun lobby."

Attempts to regulate the use of
firearms is nothing new in this
Massachusetts tried in
1692 to bar carrying offensive
weapons in public. Surveys show
more than 20,000 state and local
laws dealing with guns.

Why, one asks, are guns so
prevalent in American society?

Hunting, of course. has been the
traditional reason for civilian
ownership of ﬁrearms. Indeed,
hunters own the maiority of
privately held rifles and shotguns.
These weapons, however, are not
involved in most gun crimes.

Historian Richard Hofstadter, in
America as a Gun Culture, writes,
“For millions of American boys,
learning to shoot and receiving the
first real riﬂe of their own were
milestones of life, veritable rites of
passage that certified arrival at
manhood.”

This is still true in many parts of
the country--the South, the Mid-
west, the Far West--wherever rural
influences’ are pronounced,

According to Carl Bakal, a
long-time writer on the gun
question, 59% of individuals in the
South own a gun, compared to 34%
in the East. ,

In ‘addition, millions of Ameri-
cans genuinely fear their neighbor-
hood streets after dark, and the
notion of defending oneself and
one's family, or “fighting back,"
has gained great appeal.

This despite Zirnring’s evidence
that, “The handgun in your house
is more likely to kill you or a
member of your family than to save
your life."

Distrust of the government forms
os gunowners'

licensing of guns.
“When a nation is a free
nation,"‘said Makovich, “by and

for the people, that nation,
seemingly. should not ‘fear the
people.

scheme behind its efforts to control
arms.

"The first step of a dictator or
police state is to control ﬁrearms.
The people are then at the mercy of
the state."

Recent evidence of the govern-
ment's illegally wiretapping news-
papermen and its own officials.
misusing data-bank information,
burglarizing private offices and
spying upon dissident groups, does
nothing to alleviate the gunowners'
suspicions.

Another contention of the gun-
men is the existing gun laws are
not enforced by the courts.

Makovich said, “There_ is a
penalty on the statutes of Pennsyl-
vania law, calling for a minimum
sentence of five years, for any act
ofviolence with agun. It is rarely
enforced.”

Pittsburgh Police Superinten-
dent Robert E. Colville agreed.

"lf existing gun legislation was
enfor-ced there would be no

 

n Conhol

difficulty.

“However, the US is a gun-or-
iented society. This is reflected by
the iudges' decisions which only
represent the will of the people."

A study conducted by the New
York Police Department which
appeared in the New York Times
last September indicated few gun
offenders are jailed in that state.

It reported “The chances that a
person arrested for carrying a
loaded pistol on the streets of New
York City will escape conviction
and imprisonment have increased
in the last two years.

Colville sees part of the rise of
gun ownership as psychological.

“An example is what happened
shortly after the civil disorders of
the late ’60s. People in the suburbs
started arming themselves for an
invasion that never came.”

(Continued from Page 7)
is a rather dull, plodding flick, not
helped much by the pretentious
performance of Dustin Hoffman as
the foppish fellow prisoner Dega.
The‘ film itself can't decide

whether it's another prison epic--
the type of thing that was done to
death in the 40s and 50s--or an
introspective focus on one man,
where it really excels. The film
starts. stops, and starts again.
Luckily McQueen is on screen for
practicall_y every scene (two points
for the director) although he's often
inhibited by supporting characters.

Chief of these is Hoffman, who
made his fame cashing in on an
identity crisis he made famous with
The Graduate, and he tries to
never repeat the same role to avoid
a stereotype. But he has. of
course, created .1is screen image in
spite of hims If, and no matter
what the role .s he's still the same
whiny kid from New York, never
exactly sure what he's doing.

This time he’s a convicted forger,
trying to use his ill-gotten wealth to
get himself and hired protector and

eventual friend Papillon out of
prison. His character is never more
than a caricature of the rich-guy-
finally-caught, and Hoffman
shamelessly overplays it for a too
comic effect.

Never is Dega a sympathetic or
even likeable character, not even
when he attempts to help his
friend. His character, relying too
much on money and too little on
inner strength, is never properly
presented. And his friendship with
Papillon is not seen as overly
important. Fortunately, he does
not deal‘ with the film’s major

scenes, and is mainly just an,..,,

overblown secondary character
used for box office appeal and to
provide a contrast for McQueen’s
strong Papillon.

So. don't expect to see another
Steve McQueen adventure story
when you line up for Papillon.
Instead, expect the picture of a
man strong enough for any test,
right to the end when all hope
seems past, and see McQueen
paint that picture better than any

‘he's’ ever done.

Lewis Preps Squad For Season Openef

a pre-season «baseball story to-

Pro Soccer Circuit

by John Morahan

Most soccer players don't even
dream of playing pro. Their visions
extend to the sandlot ﬁelds around
their area. and maybe, iust maybe
collegiate ball. And it used to be no
American was good enough to play
professional soccer. But all that's
changing...and Pitt's got its ﬁrst
pro in Joe Luxbacher.

Luxbacher, who for the last three
years has been the scoring thrust of
the Pitt Soccer team, is turning pro.

He'll be playing the forward
position for the Philadelphia Atoms
of the North American Soccer
League (NASL).

The Atoms, league title winners
last year. will conduct the ﬁnal
signing as soon as Luxbacher
ﬁnishes out the term and returns to
Philly.

Luxbacher, an an amiable guy, is
finishing out his senior year with a"
B plus average and a. major in
biology. He’s quite modest over
his successes--Pitt’s all time

scoring record [34 goals] 'anda
member of the All-East team twice
withstanding.

Luxbacher, who was not drafted
by the Atoms. turned pro the hard
way--free agent ask. He has had
tryouts with Dallas and Boston, but
in Pliilatlelpliia he's found a home.

The NASL. in its infant stages
and still growing, is recognized as
the major soccer league in
America. The maiority of the
league is composed of Europeans
and a roster of 18, Americans
representing a minority. The
league eventually hopes to become
American-player oriented and they
see college players as the ripe crop.

The’ league has only one major

, Luxbacher

flaw--money. With a small budget,
player salaries are extremely low.
“You really have to love the game
to play professionally,” is Lux-
bacher’s comment on the ﬁnances.
Player salaries are subsudized with
outside jobs. “There are sacri-
fices,” says Luxbacher, “but they
are worth it.” _

The league's standard of play is
generally a Euro-American com-
bination: rough and physical.
Finesse has its moments but
having a tall, strong, striker is
essential. Luxbacher has the
qualifications.

“l'm.really looking forward to
the experience. They're a great
bunch of people and I'm expecting
to have a lot of fun."

Luxbacher joins some other

Aaron, climaxing a chase that has

covered 21 years. It brought
booming cannon shots and flying
balloons before 53,775 fans in
Atlanta Stadium.

The feat brought a telephone call
from the White House.

“The President phoned and
congratulated me," Aaron told
reporters afterward. “He invited

me to the White House, but didn't
set a specific time." Aaron is a
reserved, softspeaking product of
the Deep South. He faced racial
problems early in his career but
refused to harbor any bitterness.

“Times were that way then,” he
said of segregated hotels and
all-black boarding houses. “Base-
ball has been good to me, and I’ve
been lucky.” , ..

Asked at a post-game news
conference if he thought he now
might be considered the greatest
player who ever lived, Aaron
balked at such a boast.

BY HAL BOCK' ,
' AP SPORTS WRITER

Seventy-eight games went out
the window when the National
Hockey League begins the annual
chase for the oldest trophy in North
America--the Stanley Cup.

“Forget what's gone before,"
said Scotty Bowman, coach of the
defending champion Montreal Ca-
nadiens. “This is a brand new
season.”

Bowman’s Canadiens will face
the New York Rangers beginning
Wednesday night. Two other
series also start Wednesday with
Toronto at Boston and Los Angeles
at Chicago. Atlanta and Phila-
delphia get a jump on the others,
opening their series tonight in a
nationally televised game.

In World Hockey Association
playoff action Monday night. the
Houston Aeros defeated the
Winnipeg Jets 5-2. New England
plays Chicago and Cleveland meets
Toronto tonight. l

What's gone before in the NHL
has been a crazy. mixed-up season
for many of the teams going into
these best-of-seven quarter-final
series.

revealed Lewis.

Returning from last year's squad
are six people who have batted
better than the team average of
.339. They are Scott Suffrin .447;
Milan Popovich .400; Dan Slain
.388: Rich Monroe .382; Joe
Groetsch .380; and Pete Martorelli
.371.

Scott Suffrin's .447...well let's
iust say that's not “too bad."
When I asked coach Lewis how
Scott looked after having played
down South last summer. he

quickly informed me that, “we

“I think I may be one of the
best,” he said. “But Joe
DiMaggio was one of the greatest,
and so were Willie Mays and Jackie
Robinson. But I don’t think Henry
Aaron is fourth. He may be second
or third.”

Aaron's record homer came off
Al Downing of the Los Angeles
Dodgers, who like Aaron wore
number “44",on his back.

“It was a fast ball, high and
inside," Aaron said. “It hung a
little." Atlanta won the game 7-4.

Before the game, Aaron was

honored in a lavish ceremony that
featured bands, cannon blasts,
balloons and fanfare. Pearl Bailey
sang the National Anthem.

“Ain't seen nothing like this
since the burning of Atlanta," said
Miss Bailey. “All we need now is
to see General Sherman and the
Union troops come storming in
from left field.”

first-round opponents, the Rang-
ers, had a poorer defensive record

than their neighbors, the New York '

Islanders. The Rangers gave up
251 goals compared to 247 for the
Islanders. The Rangers gave up

Philadelphia goalie Bernie Par-

each had a chance to win outright
the top defensive award, the
Vezina Trophy. Each blew that
chance on the final weekend--Par-

Saturday, and Esposito when he
gave up four goals to Detroit
Sunday.

Instead. they ﬁnished tied, each
team giving up 104 goals, and~will
split the $1,500 prize.

“The Vezina is a worthless
trophy,” said Philadelphia Coach
Fred Shero.

He might not have said that if it
was his $1,500 at stake.

Philadelphia and Chicago made
the playoffs with essentially one
goalie, l?ai'ent'for the Flyers and
Esposito for the Black Hawks.

Levish are also returning perfor-
mers from last year's 10-3 club who
are looking for a better hitting year
after slumping into .250 and .181
respectively.

Coach Lewis appears to have his
biggest weakness in the outfield
with Scott Suffrin being the lone
returning Ietterman. The weather
hasn’t permitted defensive work

, for the outfielders. Let’s hope that

not too much gets beyond the
infield, or better yet perhaps the

pitching is really stronger than

E Penguins Finish Fifth;
“Wait ’Til Next Year”

BY CONNIE GIEL

Even though this was a year for
club records. the Pittsburgh
Penguins have again found them-
selves locked out of the Stanley
Cup Playoffs.

Struggling gamely nonetheless
for a respectable ﬁfth place, the
Pens wound up the 1973-4 season
in a whirlwind ﬁnish that has the
fans gloating optimistically, “Wait
till next year!"

With superstars of old perform-
ing' above and beyond the call of
duty and the eight rookies on the
team compiling pretty decent
records of their own, the team has
effectively utilized the trades that
revived the sinking team early in
the year.

Musclemen Steve Durbano and
Bob “Battleship” Kelly came to
Pittsburgh in mid-January from St.
Louis with pugilistic reputations
already established; all theyihad to
do was skate a bit and brandish a
few high sticks to satisfy the home
crowds.

But, fortunately, they accom-
plished much more; making them-
selves practically indispensable.

SUMMER

Durbano’s better-than-average
skating and puckhandling ability
delighted the fans and Penguin
management alike, who had
expected little more than brawn;
instead, they had dealt for brains
as well.

Although “Battleship" found
himself side-lined for the latter part
of the season with both bruised
knuckles and, later, pulled neck
muscles that landed him a berth in
the hospital, he too has become a
household word among Pittsburgh
hockey lovers. The musclemen
have as much crowd-drawing
appeal as their high-scoring team-
mates.

Waylaid by a pesky charley horse
for the last three games, the Pen’s
leading scorer Syl Apps still
managed to hang on to seventh
place’, -with 85 points, in the NHL
scoring race. Apps finished behind
Phil Esposito, Bobby Orr, and Ken
Hodge of Boston; he slipped from a
hard-earned fourth place while
sitting out the final games and lost
it to Wayne Cashman, also of
Boston, who gained 89 points.

team or won the games.

The club awards. announced and
presented on the last home game
(-April 6 against Philadelphia, a 6-1
win for the Pens), elicited much
ooohing and aaahing from the
astounded fans. The winners were:
leading scorer, his third in four
years. Syl Aps; top goal scorer,
Lowell MacDonald; Rookie-of-the-
Ycar. Ron Lalonde (no winner last
year, Dave Burrows copped it in
1971-2. and Jean Pronovost won in
1968-9). Unsung Hero, Captain and
veteran center Ron Schock; contri-

MacDonald (last year former
General Manager Jack Riley won);
and Player's Player, Jean Prono-
vost, who also won the 1970-1
award and shared it with Dean
Prentice in 1968-9.

The MVPlhonors were split four
ways among Apps, MacDonald,
Pronovost, and 1973-4 All-Star
defenseman Dave Burrows, who
won it last year. The Three-Star
awards were, deservedly, given to
Apps. MacDonald, and Pronovost.

In more NHL awards, Syl Apps
was chosen as the second best
player by the NHL coaches, with
Stan Mikita of Chicago polling top
votes. The coaches also picked
Dave Burrows as one of the most

improved players.

talents--stamina. agility, gentle
disposition, and high degree of
intelligence and willingness to
learn. Justin Morgan was perhaps
the most important single horse
ever to be foaled on the North
American continent. Since he was
the first distinctive American breed
his blood has inﬂuenced every
other American breed that exists
today. The Morgan brings
pleasure and pride to those who
own and view them.

“The peacock of the horse.

world" is the phrase aptly used to
describe the American Saddlebred.
The long, graceful neck with fine.
lofty head and alert ears; the short,
straight back and level croup with
high-set tail; the powerful, sloping
shoulder and depth of chest and
heart girth; trim legs that show
strength are but a few details of the
Saddlebred. It is universally
agreed that the Saddlebred has
attained a pinnacle of fiery
elegance among all horses.

, “Thorougl1bred"--a magic word
in the horse kingdom. Since time
immemorial. man has revered
speed in a horse. The Thorough-
bred, the only breed of horses
developed solely for the purpose of
racing under saddle, is the product
of the English horsemen’s ingenu-

  Stallions Grace Arena

itv for molding equine form and
spirit for a definite purpose.

The Palomino horse, with its
golden body and snow-white mane
and tail is one of the most
beautifully colored of all horses.
The history of Palominos traces
back into antiquity. Many
explanations have been given for

the name, but nothing has ever 7

been substantiated. Some say that
Cortez introduced the Palomino to
the New World.

The Arabian is perhaps the most
highly developed of all horse
breeds and is unquestionably the
oldest living pure strain handed
down to modern times. The exact
period of history in which it
originated is not deﬁnitely known,
and the details of its earliest
domestication and development
have been heatedly debated over a
long period.

In the two hour presentation of
"The Wonderful World of Hor-
ses." the gates of the past are
swung wide to allow all of these
beautifully trained horses to come
into view. They hold their heads
high. for they are proud. proud to
obey and proud to please. They are
all thoroughbreds in every sense.
