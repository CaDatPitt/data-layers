Student Opinion Survey Shows
Optimism on Peace Prospects

By Student Opinion Surveys

AUSTIN Tex., Dec. ll.-—American
college students have registered a
highly optimistic View that the
United States can stay out of the Eu-

in favor of a national referendum of

Although Dr. Leland D. Baldwin’si'
latest book, “Delectable. Country,” has 2
a distinctively local setting, it has be- i
come one of the country’s best sellers. 
Soon after its release in Oc't0be1.‘,,
the novel became immensely popular]
in Pittsburgh. From here the popu-l
larity of the novel spread eastward
and is now being widely read in the
west.

Making its ﬁrst appearance on the
best seller list of “Books,” a literary
supplement of the New York Herald
Tribune. the popularity of the novel
in the Pittsburgh and New York dis-
tricts was first evidenced when it
placed high on the list at th.e‘begin-
ning of November.

As well as being one of the coun-
try’s best sellers, “Delectable Coun-

and reviewers of “Books” __as one of
the outstanding books published since
August of this year. It is credited

The Trustee Investigation:

Some Issues Involved

In referring to the report of the Board of Trustees and its state-
ment of “growing pains,” it is necessary for students to note the
topics which the trustees included in their study. The Board will
probably continue discussion of this report at next week’s meeting.

Defects in the University ’s condition, according to the trustee
committee, include faulty organization and management, underde-
velopment of library, laboratory, am “club” facilities for students,
the lack of a code of tenure for the faculty, the “inept” management
of the change in athletic policy, and unsatisfactory relations with the
press.

’ Chancellor Bowman answered these charges of the trustee com-
mittee by pointing out the progress which the University has made
in physical ‘facilities and academic standards since his administra-
tionbegan. The trustees’ comment on faculty tenure he described as
“ready-made a.rguments on one side of the issue.”

 j '3 This report of the trustees and the Chancellor ’s answer are now
in the hands of the executive committee of the Board. Obviously,
careful*ip*'l‘anniiig is needed before action can be taken on these issues.

But until the necessary plans can be completed, the Board
should keep the students and faculty of the University informed
about what is being done. _ A A

Much of Pitt’s unfavorable publicity has arisenibecause of lack

«iof-‘in-fornIati.on as to what is going on. The University cannot afford
‘ iioiyignoreﬁthis situation, which has been publicized so Widely.

rt. Norman Ochserihirtis Address
At‘ Varsity Letter V Club Banquet

'- -4 Following “are excerpts from the speech delivered by Dr.
Norman C. Ochsenhirt, president of the Varsity Letter Club at
the banquet Monday night honoring the 1939 team:

Tonight there is one subject which I feel should be brought to the at-
tention of every one—-that is the question of honesty in intercollegiate ath-
letics; ‘ I might say here that any statement made tonight can be veriﬁed by

'fac_ts_'in possession of the Varsity Letter Club.

 Pitt, unfortunately and unwisely, has become the target for every
university and college in the country regarding subsidization of athletes.
Recently, we were perplexed to read in the Pittsburgh papers that since
Pitt had learned its lesson and had become pure in its athletic policies, a
certain university would now engage them on the football ﬁeld.

' "In defense, we know that Pitt is trying to adjust the Code Bowman,
whichisi being ‘broken every day, to conform with a situation peculiar to
our University and Western Pennsylvania. It might be well for some of
ou.r_jn'eighboring institutions, that have taken shots at us, to look to the
cleaning of their own backyards before glancing over the fence to criticize
ours. ' a

Big Ten, Ivy League Subsidize

Practically all universities and colleges participating in intercollegiate
sports subsidize athletes in some degree. Some members of the Western
Conference, the Ivy League, and hundreds of others continue it today to a
far greater extent than Pitt ever has at any time of her history.

 Pitt has yet to change the place of residence of any of its athletes so as
to enable them to obtain free tuition and farcical, political jobs on the State
payroll.

‘, The athletic departments of these institutions have been the chief of-
fenders of this intercollegiate hypocrisy. Even in the days when Pitt was
prepared to offer substantial inducements to promising athletes, we found it
irrfpossible to"cc’mpete" in that respect with many of the schools Who, today,

have undertaken to criticize our records under the pretense of purity in
their own.

Let us be the first to admit that our poor public relationsipolicies have
been ‘responsible for placing us in this vulnerable position but, neverthe-
less, that does not excuse the hypocrisy of those who pretend to be what
they are not, namely, the standard bearers of non-subsidization policies.

It was stated at one of the conferences between the Varsity Letter Club
—~-committee and University authorities last year that we were going to model

«our policies after those of a certain well known conference, supposed to

.hare;.ps I'epl1‘tati‘0n‘??iiQr purity, but which maintains under its major-domo
““a» coi~p‘s—- -of detectives” to continually investigate the member institutions‘
of this conference. *

‘Degraded State of Dishonesty’ ,

' if Intercollegiate athletics have reached a degraded state of dishonesty
when it is found necessary to investigate athletic departments of our
colleges and universities that should be the‘ standard bearers of truth and
honesty .

 Gentlemen, agreements between athletic departments and the students,
as,‘=wMe'll as between athletic departments of diﬂferent schools, too frequently
a:e,sma.ae l.oz_g;ly»;to be broken in bad faith. ‘ _ ’ ‘

 Intercollegiate athletics has become a big business, whichiin many in-
stances is conducted by methods which, if used in industry today would
result in the blacklisting and failure of the industry using such dishonest
methods . . . . . ’

‘Let "U s Be Honest’

If we are to continue to have subsidlzation in college athletics, and
without much question we are, let us be honest about it. Let our athletic
codes be honest about it. Let our athletic departments and University
oﬂicials be honest about it and not pretend to be doing. one thing while

The Pitt News

    

»‘The Museum of Modern Art on 57th street in New York, which always
Seems t0 Preﬁent the last word in exhibitions, has loaned a ton or so of
abstract art-paintings, sculpture, photographs, and dinky—widgets——to the
department of ﬁne arts. '

We are now ready to report on a biased and otherwise prejudiced study
of the hangings.

On the right as you enter the gallery, you will see some black wire
and tin which jerks and juts at all and
assorted angles. This is a “Mobile” by
Alexander Calder. When you are sure no
one is looking, give the thing a slight tap-~
jump back and watch. Don’t let on where
you got the idea to touch the thing. They
usually don’t like people to ﬁnger the ex-
hibits.

The Mobile kind of resembles Donald Duck
in a dress tin skirt.

Hanging on the back wall is Kasimer
Malevich, who wrote: “In the year 1913 in
my desperate attempt to free art from the
ballast of the objective world I ﬂed to the
form :of the square and exhibited a picture
which was nothing more for less than a
black square upon a white background. . .

Presented here, with the shaded block
representing red, is l\/lalevich’s “Red Square
and Black Square.” _,Yep. _ , .

, _Picas'so’s “Composition in Dark Green and
Blue,” not to mention bright yellow, red-
orange, black, andpurple, is one of the
favorites inthe -group. The notation notes:
“Synthetic Cubist painting.” The explanation states: “Quasi-geometrical
shapes are replaced by slightly curvedforms.” Me, too.

But probably the best work in the exhibit, at least the one which
causes the most fume and fuss is Picasso’s “Head of a Woman.” . It is a

- yellowish pink and green," brownish gray and

black bludgit in a goldish frame. ,

, ,1 , The teeth seem to worry some people, since they

4’ ' appear slightly unconventionally arranged, (see

6,’ .

donald duck?

cut), and although you can’t be sure, the mouth
seems to come out the side of her cheek. Her
tongue points out unashamedly i.nto a painted
frame. .

There are two main schools of thought on the
subject: men like this painting and women don’t.
But to say more, it is, isn’t it?

Perszonally, we think it smells just more than
-faintly (don’t stop here) like a Picasso version of
Whistler’s “Mother.” But don’t quote us. The
sketch below should giveyou some ideas.

After spending several aftertrloons watching peo-
ple wander about (one man paced up and down
before Braque’s “Violin” for ﬁfteen minutes, head
bowed, hands clasped), climb on stools (one
young lady hung down from a shelf, peered at us through stringy black
hair and then collapsed), and give learned comment (why, my two-year-
old brother does better than that), we feel that the following sugges-
tions may help relieve some vlsitor’s haggard appearance.

1. If you can walk on~ " . .
your hands, unhesitatingly
do so at the entrance to the,
gallery, and move care-
fully along the wall. This
saves wear and tear on
your neck which you’d or-
dinarily twist and stretch
to make sure the art de-
partment didn’t hang the
paintings up-side down.

2. Take a blank note-
book along with you, and
refer to its blank pages
from time to time, thus
making certain of the ex-
planations and comments
on the work.

3. Throw yourself into .  .-
the work at hand. Don’t picassois mm, and green
miss a painting. B , _

4. Chew gum vigorously-—the faster the better._ This will distort
your own appearance, and you will make the exhibit more interesting
to others.

5. After you have completed your observations, draw two deep

, breaths on the house, gulp a
couple of times, and pretend
you understand what its all
about

6. This completed. stalk
over to a sunny window ledge,
grasp the sill with both of your
hands, then leap out the seventh
floor window.

If you are lucky some ab-
stract arti.<.:t may be passing by
4-and‘ get a picture of a marsh-
mallow getting a rnaﬁic“u1'e.

To add to the confusion, we
might mention that the depart-
ment has placed two excellent
volumes on abstract art on the
ledges below the hangings.

Don’t get us‘ wrong: we reall__y
like the exhibit. Equip your-
self now, and go have a look.

Editor, the Pitt News:

Kalwary is our friend, and we love
him; but so is McElwain. and we
love him too. That is why we hate
to see each of them getting his
.friends to write “Letters to the

If the boys will only forget their
differences in regard to the football
situation——-the season’s over, any-
how——we will be overjoyed to spon-
sor a reconciliation. We W2-mt them
to kiss and make up. ,

VVe will supply a photographer for
the osculatory reunion, and we.

FROM THE

SIDELINES

By BILL McELWAIN
Sports Editor

IT WOULD SEEM that several people have taken exception to
what we said last week about Pittpourri conductorKal Kalwary. In
fact, the editor is complaining about the volume of mail coming into
the ofﬁce. He always steams open the envelopes’ so that they can be
used again, and he has been severely burned twice in the last week.

Under the circumstances, it would be impossible to answer all
the letters by return post. (The business manager is hiding his
stamps). But we thought that the next best thing would be to de-
vote a line or two in this column to each of Kal’s friends,

First, there is Katherine McClintock of Pennsylvania College for
VVomen. She says Kalwary is prettier than we are. This is unde-
niably true, but we must remind Miss McClint'ock that brains and
personality must also be taken into consideration. (Ed. Note--That
leaves Kalwary ahead of McElwa.in on three counts).

Good Point, Tim

Tim Raker says, “Less McElWain, more Kalwary is what 1 a1.
ways say. What do you always say?” We give Mr. Raker credit
for asking a very sensible question, but answering it leaves us
stumped. Since we wrote that column about Kal, we really haven’t
had a chance to say anything. No one but Phi Eps will speak to us.

To Raymond J. Hinclrichs, who corrected us on our version of
the Battle of _the Commons Room, we can only reply that, while Kal
may have given the Duquesne ROTC a lesson in applied military
tactics, he wasn’t wearing those smoked glasses next day purely for
purposes of anonymity. , A 0

Dave Boies also thinks that weare _on the wrong side of the
fence. He not onlydoesn’t like what we said about Kal, but seems to
be nursi.ng a peeve about Dr. Sutherla.nd’s resignation. Right there,
we draw the line. We had nothing to do with Dr. Sutherla.nd’s resig-
nation. . ‘ .

Iniaddition, Mr. Boies thinks we must be very young. There he

has us. We are young and our birth certiﬁcate proves it. But so
are Shirley Temple and Baby Sandy, and look at the success they ’re
making. . ‘

Thanks, Bub ,.

The next letter may have made a point, but we’re not sure. It ’s
signed by the misses Russell, Weber, Perring, Roughton, and VVelday
and announces, “VVe fraternity women. think that Kalwary--in or
out of the Tuck Shop-—-is okay.” ‘We too like Kalwary, but since we
have seen him out of the Tuck Shop so seldom, we would hesitate to
repeat the young ladies’ sweeping statement. I

Burgin Digby pays us a compiliment. Until he told us we were,
we never beleved that anyone could be -a Red, a Nazi, and a Fascist
all at the same time. It ’s.a nice trick.‘ Mr. Digby states that a stu-
dent who has participated extensively in activities is entitled to voice
an opinion. ‘Ne think Kal is doing very well in this respect.

To VVilliam Ryan, may we say that we are cutting Journalism
81 regularly and that for a time we were teaching Orientation 1. On
the whole though, we must agree with Mr. Ryan who says, “Mr. Mc-
Elwain’s undue criticism of Mr. Kalwary obviates a public apology.”
That ’s precisely what we think. ’

‘We congratulate Kal on his many loyal friends, but we suggest
that they cultivate their sense of humor.

bers today were proudly displaying
17-jewel, gold cased wrist Watches,
the visible proof of their having been
chosen on The Pitt News A.ll-Ameri-
can team.

‘ The teeth was the unanimous choice
of The Pitt News All-American
Board, composed of Bertram I. Jaffe,
approximately C40. The boarcl’s se-
lections were based on rules previ-
ously set down by Pitt News sports-
writer-at—large Bill Mazefsky, C40.

The watches, manufactured by F.
W. Woolworth Company, prominent
local jeweler, have been presented to
R. X. Graham, halfback and the man
who keeps Maxine Holbrook from
getting anything done: , R o b e rt

Machesney,‘halfback in charge of ig-
noring student publications; and Jack
Hoeveler, C40, plunging fullback for
the you-know—what magazine.

Other watches were given to Rob-
ert C. Adams, C40, quarterback who
directs the attackof The News; ends
William McAlpin McJunkin and An-
drew Ferguson, both either C or BA
something or other and permanent
guests of mouthpiece Frank Carver;
and Mazefsky who was chosen at
tackle out of professional courtesy.

The other four members of the
team, including ice man Joe Srnaltz,
the bartender at Frankie’s, and two
Brinks guards, weren’t around to re-

ceive their awards, so J affe took them.

Writers’ Eleven

Harmon Bests Kinnick
In Race for Captain
Of Number One Team

Keeping pace with the ﬂood of All-
American teams that annually sweep
the nation, sport writers of various
collegiate publications have voted for
the players they deemed worthy of
All-American rating.

Sixty-seven sports writers repre-
senting colleges and universities in
36 states, took part in the poll con-
ducted annually by Bob Kunkel of
radio station KGHL in Billings,
Montana. , 

Selected for the end positions were
Ken Kavanaugh, pass receiver de-

luxe of Louisiana‘ State, and Bud’

Kerr, stellar wingman of the Notre
Dame “ﬁghting Irish.”  —

Undefeated and untied"Texas A&M
placed Joe Boyd at a tackle to team
up" with Nick Drahos, Cornell stand-
out. - « ‘ V ~ v

The guards, are Harry Smith of
Southern California ‘and Bob Suf-
fridge, half of the Molinski-Suffridge
combination from down Tennessee
Way. ' ' 9

Northwestern’s Johnny Haman was
picked to fill the center slot, winning
over Kodros of Michigan and Schiecl
of Santa Clara.

The backs were Tom Harmon, se-
lected as captain, from Michigan;
Niles Kinnick, Iowa’s iron man and
passer extraordinary; George Cafego,
brilliant Tennesee back who has
helped the Vols maintain their unde-
feated, untied, and unscored upon
record, and Paul Christman of the
University of Missouri.

“Dandy” Dick Cassiano led the
Pitt players by copping a place on
the second team. End Johnny Dick-
inson was placed on the sport writ-
ers’ ninth team. Tackle Ted Konet-
sky, and guards Rudy Gradisek and
Hal Klein were given honorable men-
tion. Other Panthers receiving nom-
inations from the scribes were ends
Joe Rettinger and John Stahl, and
tackle Frank Kristufek.

Each sports writer submitted two
complete teams of players. To re-
ceive honorable mention a player had
to be selected on a ﬁrst team on one
ballot, or on two second teams.

Zephyrs Favored
To Top Evening

School Cagers

Although the approaching Christ-
mas recess curtails the Thursday and
Friday cards to some extent, a full
schedule promises plenty of action
in the various intramural depart-
ments today.

The fraternity cagers are idle to-
day, but there are several high class
independent ﬁves playing. The
Zephyrs, one of the Paul Zehfuss’
independent units, will take the ﬂoor
for the first time, having scored a pre-
vious victory on forfeit.

This group of frosh cagers is re-
puted to be much the classier of the
two, and should win in a romp over
the evening school. Word from the
basketball coaching staff declares that

First Test in Panthers
At Indianapolis Friday

Indiana Collegiate Champions to Send Veteran
Ball Club Against Touring Pittsburgh Floormen

The Butler Bulldog’s visions of a possible national title will
either prove a reality or whirl into a delusion when Tony Hinkle’s
Butler team mixes shots with the Panther basketeers at the Indian-
apolis ﬁeldhouse Friday evening.

Last year’s Indiana Collegiate basketball champions, the Butler
cagers hope for a repeat and back up their aspirations with nine re-
turning lettermen. They were on the¢* _ _ i _
long end of 14 games and were de_ guards. Dietz and Steiner tallled
feated but six times last season.

Approximately 35 candidates show-
ed up for Coach Hinkle’s ﬁrst call for
talent, nine of them lettermen, the
others ambitious sophomores and
basketball minded students.

Hinkle’s main problem to date is
to_ ﬁnd capable replacemenlfis for
George Perry, center, and Bill Geyer,
forward,'who were lost by graduation
last year. Perry, although bothered
with a trick knee throughout the sea-
son, played .a smart pivot game, and
Geyer was a sparkling shot under the
basket.  .

Bill‘ Hamilton, a southerner from
Louisville, is the leading candidate
for the post vacated by Perry.- = Close
behind are Loren Joseph, a senior,
and Jack Clayton. Others providing,
competition are sophomores John

This year introduces Butler to a 22
game schedule, one that will pit the

Page Predicts Dismal

Future for

Self-Interest And
Imperialism Brought
War, Says Author

American youth faces a dismal
future, a future of unrest, dissen-
sion, and bitterness that will spell
disaster whether or not this coun-
try enters the present European
war. -

This black picture of “things to
come” was painted Monday by Kirby
Page, noted authority on interna-
tional relations in an Inquiry Forum
address in which the author struck
out bitterly at the seeds of national
economic self-interest and imperial-
ism, which Mr. Pagesees as the roots
of today's “world of ‘self-centered-
ness’ and violence.”

Considering the question of pos-
sible American intervention in the
European conﬂict, Mr. Page declared
that another war for America would
send the federal debt mounting at the
rate of two and one-half billion dol-
lars a month. “We don’t even know
what high taxes are,” Mr. Page de-
clared.

But even America’s non-interven-
tion promises little less than utter
ruin for America, Mr. Page believes.
“We will be disastrously affected even
as a neutral,” he declared, “we are on
the verge of a war boom, and in three
years our industry will be geared to
the European war machine.” ‘

“What does this war boom mean?”
he asked. “It means ruin. It means
unemployment on a scale never be-
fore realized in America, unemploy-
ment that will inevitably follow the
collapse of the war bubble.

“Today’s University students have
come into an hour of storm which
they will be fortunate to outlive,” Mr.
Page said. Their objective, he con-
tinued, should be to broaden their
understanding of the roots of the
present war which are self-interest
and international imperialism. These
forces have been surrounded with a
“halo of religion and education for
generations.” They must be replaced
with a sense of international cooper-
ation—-“not cleavage, but unity,” Mr.
Page declared.

Asked to comment on the foreign
policy of the present administration,
Mr. Page declared that Roosevelt’s
“belligerent outbursts” and “inherent
hatred of Hitler” was sending Amer-
ica perilously close to the brink of

catastrophe. “Congress, however, is
overwhelmingly against war,” he
added.

Short Gets Appointment

W. Irwin Short, assistant professor
of civil engineering, has been ap-
pointed to the committee in charge

ican Road Builders’ association, an-
nounces Adelbert Doefendorf, Uni-

Mr. Short, a graduate of the Mis-
souri School of Mines and of the
University has been a faculty mem-

quantity already collected in the al-
cove at the south end of the Com-
mons Room, near the bookstore.

Bald:/vin’ss Book

Continued from page one

historical romance of the days of the
Whiskey rebellion.”

When his book was accepted by the
publishers, Dr. and Mrs. Baldwin
were touring Europe. Upon reach-
ing Munich, they found a publisher’s
contract waiting them. They were
advised that the book was being set
in type.

First edition of the book was
planned for October 11. The Bald-
wins intended to be back in plenty
of time for the event but the Euro-
pean war delayed their departure
from foreign soil.

They had planned sailing from Ire-
land on the Mauretania, but because
of the Athenia disaster, this ship can-
celled its stop at Cobh, Ireland.

Forced to drive across the country
to catch a ferry at Wales and then to
speed to Southampton, the Baldwins
met another trick of fate when a
British army truck, its driver blinded
by smoke from a brush fire, rammed
into and demolished their car.

A staff car supplied by the military
commander of that area enabled them
to catch the Mauretania at South-
ampton, and they arrived in America
late in September.

Dr. Baldwin explained that he does
all of his writing in longhand and has
no set schedule for writing. When in-
spiration strikes him, he writes and
often continues throughout the night.

The novel, recommended by the
Book—of-the-Month Club and the
Literary Guild, is now in its ﬁfth
printing.
