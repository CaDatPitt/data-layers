Fraternity system
receives evaluation

By Michele Kiraly
Staff Writer -

Representatives of the National In-
terfraternity Conference visited Pitt
this past week to evaluate the Inter-
fraternity Council and the fraternity
system.

Sponsored by the IFC and the Office
of Student Activities, the NIC evalua-
tion will offer specific suggestions and
recommendations for overall improve-
ment of the fraternity system from an
objective team of experienced experts
in fraternity programming and
rrianagement.

“We’re trying to do some fine tun-
ing in order to make the outstanding
experience of being part of a fraterni-
ty even better,” said Wilfred Butler,
executive director of Delta Upsilon
fraternity and NIC evaluator.

“We’ve talked with alumni, staff
members and IFC representatives and
received a good overview of the fra-
ternities on this campus. Now, we
can develop our perceptions of the
organizations from what we have seen
and heard,” said Jonathan J. Brant,
executive director of the NIC and a

Philippine

team evaluator.

Both representatives commended
Pitt’s fraternity organizations for their
eagerness to be in the forefront of the
system since it was they who encour-
aged the evaluation. . '

In addition, the team will evaluate
the fraternity system in such areas as
organization structure, scholarship
achievement, program planning and
implementation, communications and
member needs.

Butler and Brant are experienced
evaluato_rs as they have traveled to
many college campuses throughout the
country. Butler alone has visited over
300 colleges. “I bring my own frater-
nity background and experience, hav-
ing worked 22 years for Delta Up-
silon,” he said.

Although an official report will not
be available for several weeks, the NIC
team composed one general recom-
mendation.

The team encouraged Pitt’s IFC to
create an Alumni Interfraternal Con-
ference. This organization would con-
sist of key alumni from each chapter
and they would meet regularly to share
their views and experience on frater-
nal matters.

elections

shake the countryside

By Michael Ashford

Assistant News Editor

Tensions were high amid reports of
politically motivated violence in the
Philippines yesterday as President Fer-
dinand E. Marcos and his opponent,
Corazon C. Aquino, officially ended
their presidential campaigns one day
before the election, as had been agreed.

The election will decide the fate of
Marcos’ dictatorial rule and much
more. The government under Marcos
faces the instability of a strong revolu-
tionary force, which has established
itself among this island nation’s outer
provinces. '

Aquino has pledged she will set up
a dialogue with the rebel forces in an
attempt to bring an end to ongoing
clashes between government troops and
rebel forces if she wins the election.
Marcos, on the other hand, has accused
Aquino of being a communist herself,
alluding that if the elections outcome
goes against him, there will be civil
war.

In a recent development. the New
York Ti/nc'.s' reported yesterday that an
inlluential archbishop in the nation‘s
capital, Manila. has indirectly endorsed
Aquino, calling her “an honest and
sincere woman who will also make a
good president.“ Marcos had ordered
the Catholic church not to involve itself

in the elections earlier this week.

Eighty-four percent ofall Filipinos are
Catholic. A .
Both candidates ended their cam-

paigns this week with demonstrations
in Manila. Marcos accused Aquino of
inviting a communist uprising at his ral-
ly and said, “You have sowed an at-
mosphere of hatred, anger and revolu-
tion. Now I say to you, the government
ofthe Philippines is not defenseless."

Aquino’s closing demonstration on
Wednesday drew hundreds of
thousands of supporters, according to
the New York Times. From her office
she released a final statement that read:
“As the old dictator lurks in his palace
with his cronies and his false medals
for comfort, I warn him: Do not cheat
the people on Friday.”

Fears of electoral corruption have
plagued the election since the campaign
began 57 days ago. The Philippines has
a long history of manipulated
ballotting.

Marcos reneged on an earlier pro-
mise to keep the army in their barracks
on election day. Government troops
under the command of his cousin and
confidant, Gen. Fabian C. Ver, were
put on 24-hour full—alert yesterday and
will be deployed to ballotting cites
around the country today. The deploy-
ment has raised long—standing fears that
ballot boxes will be corrupted.

In hopes of assuring fair election out-
comes. several observation groups ar-
rived in Manila this week to monitor
voting. They include 20 American
observers from political think tanks and
the press, as well as several Con-
gressmen. The U.S. delegation is
chaired by Sen. Richard G. Lugar of

Group to examine B.S./B.A. program

“By Nancy Quick
Staff Writer

As part of the second phase of the
University Planning Process, a Com-
mitte on Baccalaureate Education has
been established at Pitt to examine and
make recommendations regarding the
structure, content, quality and policies
of “our current baccalaureate degree

programs,” according to Assistant Pro-

vost Jack Daniel.

Daniel, in a discussion paper pre-
sented to the provost last fall, said,
“The national context as well as the
university’s concerns with its bac-
calaureate degrees suggest that this is
a very appropriate time to conduct a
systematic examination of our bac-
calaureate degree experiences, and to
redefine them as appropriate."

The committee. organized by Pro-
vost Roger Benjamin, is divided into
five subgroups. Each group reviews
one of five aspects of the university
structure:

0 Minimum Basic Skills and General
Education Requirements —— Reviewing
the adequacy-of minimum requirements
throughout the university.

0 Admissions — Reviewing stan-

dards for admission.

0 Undergraduate Program Articula-
tion — Reviewing the efficiency of
movement from one aspect of the
university to another: from one school
or college to another, from regional
campuses to Oakland, from high school
to university, and from other univer-
sities to Pitt.

0 Periodic Review of Undergraduate
Programs -— Establishing a set of
recommendations for criteria and pro-
cedure of such a review.

0 Articulation Between Undergrad-
uate Support Programs and the General
Undergraduate Ambiance —— Review-
ing ways in which the general
undergraduate academic environment
can be improved.

The recently completed first phase of
the University Planning Process estab-
lished some of the following recom-
mendations concerning undergraduate
education. An Honors College is to be
established for undergraduates. By the
end of fiscal year 1986, all instructional

units will have mandatory student and

peer evaluation of teaching. The
Graduate School of Business will sub-
mit a proposal for an undergraduate
degree in business administration. A
School of Health Sciences will be

created to encompass the Schools of
Health Related Professions, Nursing
and Pharmacy. The creation of a Com-
mittee on Baccalaureate Education
comes as one of the first-phase recom-
mendations and constitutes a second
phase of the planning process.

Committee members were recom-
mended by deans, heads of regional
campuses and members of the Pro-
vost’s Advisory Committee on
Undergraduate Programs. Each sub-
committee includes at least one student

member.

The full committee has met once,
and will be scheduled to meet two times
a month by the end of the term. Sub-
committees have each met one or two
times, and will have ongoing meetings,
consulting with students, faculty and
staff when appropriate. I

“The reports of national commit-
tees," Daniel said, “have revealed
basic deficiencies in undergraduate
education and an inadequate degree of
coherence in the undergraduate cur-
riculum. There is a call for ‘excellence
and equity’ and a growing belief that
academic standards are too low. The
Committee on Baccalaureate Education
has been created to review these con-
cerns.

J arvik-7 recipient

continues to improve

By Michelle Zollner
Staff Writer

Surgeons at Presbyterian—University
Hospital yesterday said the condition
ofJarvik—7 mechanical heart recipient
Joseph Burello has improved and his
name is now listed on the transplant
candidate list.

Thitty—nine—year—old Burello, of New
Alexandria, Westmoreland County, re-
mains in critical condition in the
hospital’s intensive care unit. How-
ever. according to hospital spokesman
Thomas Chakurda, Burello’s condition
has stabilized since the operation.

Burello underwent the Jarvik—7
transplant five days ago  an interim
procedure until he wasstabilized and
a compatible human heart donor could
be located.

In addition to suffering from heart
problems, Burello also suffered from

Burello has been kept on a respirator
which doctors say is helping clear his
lungs of fluid.

Burello’s name was not released until
Wednesday in order to protect the
family’s identity.

Chakurda said the hospital is op-
timistic about finding a heart donor.
However, they cannot specify the ex-
act time when the transplant will take
place.

According to the Pittslmrg/’i Pre.x'.s'.
Burello raises thoroughbred horses in
his backyard.

“He looked like a college gradu-
ate. There was not an ounce of fat on
him, ” one of Burello’s friends told the
Pittsburgh Press. Another said Burello
went to the doctor in July and was told
he had the heart of a 16-year-old.

Burello also has two sons. ages 7 and

Tyranny
In The Philippines

President Marcos of the Philippines, as
agreed under heavy pressure from the United
States, will hold a special election today to
determine the future of his presidency. There
seems little chance, however, that the elec-
tion will be fair and free as promised.
Evidence of corruption and coercion has been
more than rife. .

- Take for instance Mr. Marcos’ refusal to
resign his office despite a constitutional re-
quirement that he do so prior to a special
election. Further, Mr. Marcos has tapped
into the national treasury in order to buy
votes, and he has monopolized air time on
state—run television to the exclusion of his op-
ponent. Finally, the election will be super-
vised by the military headed by the notorious
Gen. Fabian Ver to ensure through intimida-
tion that which cannot be bought.

That Mr. Marcos will win the election is
nearly a foregone conclusion. But should
President Reagan fulfill his promise of no
further aid in the absence of a legitimate elec-
tion, Marcos’ triumph is sure to be a hollow
one. Marcos’ tyranny is being severely
challenged by increasing guerrilla
insurgency. A victory for Marcos is likely
to intensify military confrontation, thereby
adding the final doleful touch to the tragedy
of Marcos’ 20-year reign.

Requiem

We don’t know who fired the shot
that brought his life to a violent and
premature conclusion. It may have
been a policeman; or it may have been
one of the ghetto kids who somehow
got his hands on the Weapon of the Op-
pressor. Whoever it was, the fact re-
mains: The child is dead. H_e’s another
victim of apartheid’s senselessness.

I say “another victim,” but for me
he’s more than that. He was only four
years old  and he was my nephew.
I had never gotten a chance to meet
him, but I had heard the stories: He was
so playful, lovable, cute.  And now
he’s dead.

I heard the news this morning; I was
stunned —- then I was mad. For God’s
sake, the child was playing harmless-
ly in his backyard. He’ll play no more.
Why? How can something like this
happen? It happens every day  in
South Africa. How many people have,
in the past week alone, been driven to
ask the same empty, futile questions
which I find myself asking tonight? So
many  too many.

lt’s funny how no matter how bleak
the situation, we always try to find a
positive aspect within it. Maybe that’s
why I started to think to myself that
maybe my nephew will be happier
wherever he is now than he would have
been, growing up black in South

Africa. Where he is now, is he destined
to an existence in which the color of
his skin will determine every single
aspect ofhis life? Will he be restricted
to a desolate ghetto and be forced to
carry a pass-book? Will he be subjected
to constant harrassment by officials,
summary detention and torture?

He’s dead, and yet I feel we
shouldn’t mourn for him. He was black
in_South Africa. He was only four
years old. He faced a future of constant
misery and injustice. But he’s happy
now.

Apartheid, you killed him, but now
you can harm him no longer.

Boon To Students

Recently, editorials and cartoons in
The Pitt News have suggested that the
new supercomputer at Pitt and CMU
is being financed at the expense of
students. That is simply not the case.

The new facility should be a real
boon to students, especially those who
can benefit from increased familiarity
with large—scale computations. Pitt will
also be a better place for students
because it will develop new strengths,
and be more successful in recruiting top
faculty.

To measure developments at Pitt ex-
clusively in terms of their immediate
impact on undergraduate teaching is to

   

confuse the mission of the university
with that of a community college. That
is no service to Pitt students.

Poor Sport

When I turn to the sports section of
The Pitt News I like to read about
sports, not about Bob Travers’ little
league career or his hippie high school
friends. Who cares how far he ran
yesterday or how far his waistline
bulges over his belt? Certainly not I.
Why doesn’t he stick to writing about
sports and spare us the history of his
putrid life? And Bob, if the student sec-
tion is too rowdy for you, why don’t
you buy season tickets and sit across
the floor with the senior citizens? One
last thing: If we make you embarrassed
to be a Pitt student, then why don’t you
get the hell out of our school? The
university and The Pitt News would
definitely be better off without a jerk
like you. And the worst part of it is,
you’rc not even a funny jerk.
P.S. Ifl was in the sixth grade and you
were in the first grade I’d kick the s-——
out of you.
Name Withheld Upon Request

Not In Kansas/Kevin Bold

I had lunch with a fellow space
enthusiast at CMU the other day.
After making up for some lost time,
as I had not seen him since
December, the conversation shifted
to the space programs future. We
arrived at the conclusion that after
waiting for a few months, the anti-
space people would crawl out from
under the woodwork and begin
again their task of eroding the space
program.

We certainly underestimated
them. Already I’ve heard some
people renew the call to “spend
money on Earth instead of in
space” — as if, to paraphrase
science fiction author Ben Bova, all
we’ve ever done in space was to
take up big sacks of money and put
it in orbit. (That’s not true, but even
if it were, it wouldn't be a bad idea:
It would at least decrease the money
supply and help contain inflation.)
Money spent “in space” is really
money spent on earth, and in the
long run, it’s been good for the
economy. Ten years ago Chase

Econometrics did a study on the

What The Meek Inherit

space program’s effect on the

economy and concluded that for

every billion dollars invested in the

space program between 1975 and

1984, there would be 800,000 new

jobs (“Jobs. Not Space” — hah!)

and an increase in the GNP of $23

billion. And that was just for

starters. I’m tempted to rattle off a

list of the “spinoff” technologies,

but space (no pun intended) does

not permit. Besides, most of you

are already familiar with the

Fashionable Irreverence/George Kresak I

Delayed Gratification

Mr. Reagan's program of social

justice is a metaphor for the awful, con-

suming philosophy of Jack London's
Wolf Larsen in “The Sea Wolf.” The
meek are about to be trampled into the
earth with little regard for the strictures
of God or the imperatives of eternal
salvation. No remorse. no regretszjust
the infinite frenetic triumph of the
strong and ruthless over the humble and
“wntrodden.

In urgent need of a force—fed spoon-
ful of a proper dose of humility, I
entered church last Sunday for the first
time in eight years. I chose a Protes-
tant church, my fear-laden perusal of

Jonathan Edwards “Sinners in the
Hands ofan Angry God” having con-
vinced ine that it served the most
wrathful. awful God of all. A raving.
vengeful God. thought I, might bejust
the thing to reduce me to a trembling
state of salubrious subservience.

Sliding into the rear pew, I frowned
at the stinking, foul—breathed old
derelict then beside me gleefully wring-
ing his hands. “Maggoty—headed. old
wretch," said I in a whisper of feign-
ed piety, unable to suppress the in-
sidious wrench of irreverent mischie-
vousness even in this holy place.
“What wicked effrontery is this?
Darest thou grin so stupidly in the

house of the Lord? Thinkest thou to
mock God Almighty‘? Think better
upon it, blasphemous demon. and put
your countenance dour. your demeanor
grave."

Shaken from his reverie. the wine-
soaked old sot turned to me resentful-
ly. “Nay." said he in a croaking voice.
“I mock not the Lord. but rather in my
inner rhapsody I laud God and His
beneficence. ’ ’

“Ignorant fool," said I, abruptly
dropping my pious ruse, “has drink so
addled your brain that you do not com-
prehend your own destiny? What have
you to thank God or anyone for? Fate

has left you forlorn and hopeless. not
even human dignity is left you. Only
in death when your withered carcass
has become rotten with maggots shall
your suffering end.”

“Preciselyf said he, the denial of
God’s existence implied by my words
eluding his obtuse mind. “In death‘s
bosom shall I receive my just reward.
Then the Lord shall call me to His side
and with unabashed delight shall I look
upon the eternal sufferings of the pro-
ud and avaricious condemned to Hell.
Than shall I know revenge upon those
who have made my stay on earth a tor-
merit.”

“Some retching feeling akin to pity

Simply Speaking/Tim van, Gelder

For six months now. the Soviets have
adhered to a voluntary, unilateral
moratorium on the testing of nuclear
weapons. In less than two months. that
moratorium will cease — unless,
sometime before then. the United States
also volunteers to halt testing. _g.

But why should the United States join
a testing moratorium? The answer is
simple — a comprehensive ban on
nuclear testing is probably the single
most effective means of putting a halt
to the spiralling nuclear arms race.
Moreover. if we accept the rhetoric of
the Reagan administration at face value.
an end to the arms race is a top national
priority. It follows that we should do
everything in our power to bring about
an end to nuclear testing — which in-
cludes, immediately and most obvious-
ly, joining with the Soviets in a
moratorium. '

If we want to end the nuclear arms
race. a comprehensive, multilateral test
ban makes perfect sense. The arms race
is notjust an accumulation of warheads.
More importantly, it can be seen as an
accumulation of weapons S_VSf€I7IS each
one more powerful and threatening than
the last. When one side introduces a new
weapons system, the other side feels
compelled to match it. and so the escala-
tion proceeds in quantum leaps. The
reason a comprehensive test ban would
be so effective is that it strikes right at
this central problem. No significant new
nuclear weapons system can be
developed and deployed without exten-

sive testing: and without new weapons
systems. the drive to acquire new
weapons is stifled. Not even Caspar
Weinberger wants more Polaris or Titan
missiles.

Moreover. a limit on the ever-
increasing abundance of different
weapons systems would greatly reduce
the difficulties involved in negotiating
arms reductions agreements. One reason
arms control treaties are elusive is that
neither side can agree just which
weapons should be cut. With new
weapons systems constantly coming on
line, the uncertainties introduced simply
make the problem worse. A moratorium
on weapons testing would substantially
reduce the problem of potential arms _
agreements becoming outdated before
they are even signed.

If the arguments in favor of joining
the Soviet moratorium are so compel-
ling, why does the Reagan administra-
tion appear to be deliberately and stead-
fastly ignoring this crucial opportunity?
As is so often the case, there are two
sorts of reason — the official ones and
the unofficial ones. The official reasons,
it turns out, are uniformly unconvinc-
ing. The one most often cited is that we
need to continue testing in order to en-
sure the ongoing reliability of existing
stockpiles — for, after all, effective
deterrence requires that our weapons be
able to do their job, if needed. But the
argument is simply disingenuous, given
that well over half of the nuclear tests
carried out by the United States are not

U.S. Nuclear Testing And The Soviet Moratorium

performed to ensure reliability at all. but
rather for the development of new
weapons systems. Moreover. if all
testing was abandoned on both sides. the
resulting loss of conﬁdence in reliability
would only strengthen security. not
weaken it. Why‘? Because if reliable
warheads are needed for deterrence.
they are needed even more for a first
strike; thus increasing loss of confidence
only means increasing reluctance to
make a first strike.

If the official reasons for rejecting a
test ban are unconvincing, the unofficial
reasons are alarming. It is clear that if
you want to develop new weapons
systems. you have to preserve the ability
to test. But the other side of this unpleas-
ant coin is [that] if you are opposed to
the banning of nuclear testing. most
likely that is because you are commit-
ted to the development of new weapons
systems. This, unfortunately. is the real.
underlying reason that the administra-
tion refuses to consider a testing
moratorium — it would cripple our own
ongoing weapons development pro-
grams. In short, the very effectiveness
ofa test ban in reducing the arms race
may be precisely why a ban is being re-
jected. Banning nuclear testing means
limiting the” arms race. and that is not
something that administration hawks
like Richard Perle are ready to accept.
at least in the foreseeable future.

Instead of a ban on nuclear testing.
the administration proposes deep and
verifiable cuts in existing stockpiles. A

moment’s reflection. however. reveals
how this is no real answer to the arms
race. Deep cuts in existing stockpiles
does not by itself prevent the deploy-
ment of any threatening new weapons
systems. and does not require curtail-
ing the billions that are annually wasted
on the production of weapons of mass
destruction. Far from being a response
to the arms race. the Reagan proposal
in effect just offers to trade redundant
older weapons for newer. more
dangerous and more expensive varieties.

If it rejects the goal of limiting the
development of nuclear weapons. the
administration would nevertheless
prefer —— for obvious reasons — that this
information not be widely publicized.
The trouble with the Soviet moratorium
is that it highlights the difference be-
tween the administration‘s rhetoric and
its real policies. This is why the ongoing
Soviet moratorium is so very embarrass-
ing for the Reagan administration, and
why it is being conveniently ignored in
public debates on arms control issues -
and. unfortunately, in the media as well.
Hoping the whole issue will be quietly
forgotten, the administration is just
biding its time until March 31. That is
when the Soviets will be forced to
resume testing. lest they get too far
behind. That time is now less than two
months away. Clearly. it is up to Con-
gress and the general public to make
those two months as uncomfortable for
the administration as possible.

and the disapproving stares of the con-
gregation compelled me to choke down
an extensive discourse on the evils of
religion. Let him have his solace,
thought I, stinking of compassion.

Mr. Reagan is a land—lubbing Wolf
Larsen, captain of a seal—hunting vessel
by dint of his superiority. Wolf Larsen
knew he was dying and the madness of
his devouring will impelled him to the
destruction of his ship and crew. Im-
portunities will not dissuade Mr.
Reagan from his lunatic course of
ultimate mayhem, so clutch desperately
to religion and the promise of bliss in
the sweet by and by.

Female athletes to be honored

By Leeli Davidson
Staff Writer

Next month. Pittsburgh will be the
first U.S. city to honor its female
athletes in an award ceremony that will,
among other things, honor Pittsburgh
area women swimmers and runners,
coaches and lifetime achievers.

The “Celebrate Women in Sports”
award dinner, presented by the Pitts-
burgh Chamber of Commerce, will be
on March 19 at 7 p.m. at the Hilton
Hotel. Five hundred people are ex-
pected to attend the award dinner,
which is part of the “Greater Pitts-
burgh Chamber of Commerce Sport
Showcase Series.” In this series, the
chamber of commerce holds an annual
luncheon for the Pittsburgh Pirates, as
well as arranging events for the
Penguins and the Pitt Panthers.

Eligible for the awards are women
athletes from the Pittsburgh area, from
novices to Olympic gold medal win-
ners. The competitors must either be
nominated by an organization, such as
a sports club or university, or by a
private individual. The nomination
deadline is Feb. 7. The chamber of
commerce has sent out 245 nomination
packets.

The committee organizing the
"Celebrate Women in Sports" event
includes several Pitt faculty members.
A panel of six judges will choose the
winners.

Alan R. Kugler, the chamber of
commerce‘s communication manager,
said that the purpose of the award din-
ner is "to recognize and honor Pitts-
burgh area women athletes who par-
ticipate. and achieve in the athletic
arena.”

Of the award ceremoney, Kugler
said that the chamber of commerce is
“hoping to establish this as an annual
event.”

On the night of March 19, ﬁve types
of awards will be bestowed on women
athletes. Comprising the major

categories are the sports award, the past
achievement award, the athlete of the
year award, the coach of the year
award and the lifetime achievement
award.

The sports award consists of 10 dif-
ferent categories, covering the wide
range of physical activities in which
women athletes participate. Three of
the 10 categories in the sports award
are: the “speed endurance” award, the
“individual vs. individual” award and
the “physically challenged” award.

The “speed endurance” category in-
cludes sports such as marathon running
and cross country skiing. The “in-
dividual vs. individual” category in-
cludes fencing and badminton, and the
“physically challenged” category is for
physically handicapped athletes.

The past achievement award is the

second award on the agenda. This‘

award will go to “one athlete who has
shown outstanding achievement in her
particular sport prior to the year
1985,” according to the chamber of
commerce.

The third award, athlete of the year,
pits sportswomen of roughly the same
age against each other and consists of
four categories. A winner will be taken
from the high school, college, indepen-
dent and masters categories. The in-
dividuals in the independent category
are, said Kugler, “any competing
athlete[s] under 50 years of age not in
high school or college." The masters
category is for those athletes who are
age 50 or older.

The two final award categories are

the coach of the year award and the
lifetime achievement award. The
chamber of commerce said the coach
of the year award will go to “the
female coach who has made an out-
standing contribution toward women‘s
sports.” The lifetime achievement
award will go to “a local woman who
will be selected for having devoted a
lifetime to the advancement of
women's athletics.”

Besides the awards ceremony, at the
“Celebrate Women in Sports” dinner
there will be a parade of champions.
Kugler said that the “parade of cham-
pions is to feature women athletes who
are representing their sponsoring
organization and their organization’s
participation in women’s sports.

High schools, universities and sports

clubs will be asked to choose one
female athlete to represent them in the
parade of champions. An athlete can
be in both the parade of champions and
the award program.

Pitt has a committee whose function
is to nominate women university
athletes for the awards program and the
parade of champions. The committee’s
members number about 13 and include
coaches and professors. The six
women’s varsity teams that contestants
may be chosen from are: basketball,
gymnastics, swimming, tennis, track
and field, and volleyball.

Kurt Bruce, head basketball coach at
Pitt, discussing whom the committee
will nominate, said, “We are trying to
get somebody for every category.”

Excitement runs high among pro-
fessors about the first—ever female
athlete awards program. Frieda Goff,
facilities coordinator at the women’s
athletic department, said: “I think this
will make the Pittsburgh area aware of
the achievement of women athletes.
Women work just as hard as male
athletes, but they are not recognized as
often for their achievements.”

Carol Sprague, assistant athletics
professor, who is also on the universi-
ty's awards committee, agreed with
Goff. Sprague said that the winning
women athletes will “provide role
models for a younger generation of
female athletes."

Marigold Edwards. professor of
health and physical education, was
critical of the situation of women
athletes in Pittsburgh. “Pittsburgh gets
the reputation of being a sports city,"
said Edwards. “But it’s a spectator
sports city and a male one at that."

Edwards went on to say she hoped
that the awards program would inspire
women who don’t participate in any
athletic activity to begin involving
themselves in sports. Edwards said that
the emotional benefits of physical ac-
tivity were just as important as the
physical benefits. Sports, said Ed-
wards, “raises one’s sense of esteem
and confidence, and women could use
that raised.”

The public is invited to the
“Celebrate Women in Sports” dinner.
The price of attending is $25 per per-
son, and further information can be ob-
tained from the chamber of commerce
at 392-4507.

The Pitt News, February 7, 1986

The Pitt Program Council will
sponsor an appearance by Suzette
Charles, Miss America 1984, on
Tues., Feb. 11. The lecture will be
held in the assembly room of the
William Pitt Union, Fifth Ave. and
Bigelow Blvd., at 8 p.m.

Charles was the winner of the
talent competition at the 1984 Miss
America contest and the first
runner—up in the pageant. After
America heard her rendition of
“Kiss Me in the Rain,” Charles
was besieged with offers, went on
to become an opening act in Atlan-
tic City and made appearances
across the United States and around
the world. She was rehearsing a
new act to debut at the Sands in
Atlantic City when she learned that
she would assume the title of Miss
America for the two remaining
months of the 1984 reign.

Charles has been a performer for
most of her life. At seven, she won

Miss America to speak

the title of Little Miss New Jersey
and, through her teens, she ap-
peared in many commercials and
educational TV programs. She
played the role of Chrissy in the
movie musical “Hair.”

While attending the Performing
Arts High School of the Phila-
delphia College of the Performing
Arts and Temple University,
Charles continued to pursue her
singing career. In 1981 she was
named a Presidential Scholar for
her outstanding musical and
academic achievements.

Charles hopes to start work on an
album, wanting to emerge with her
own particular style; not as a Miss
America who sings. but as a singer
who became Miss America.

Tickets are available through the
Pitt box office and are free to Pitt
students. For more information,

Election

Indiana and co—chaired_ by Represen-
tative John P. Mutha ofJohnston, Pa.

The U.S. group accompanies a
45—member international delegation
and two civilian Filipino organizations.

The civilian election monitors have
already reported that the government
election commission is not cooperating
with them and that false election ballots
have been distributed throughout the
country to ensure Marcos’ victory.

In an article last Tuesday, the New
York Times reported that Marcos had
begun wielding his extensive power to
influence the elections outcome. Mar-
cos maintains virtually total control of
the technicalities of the election process
and has used his control of federal
agencies for his benefit. Such reports
range from mass mailings by the inter-
nal revenue service on Marcos’ behalf
to traffic violation arrests of opposition
supporters.

U.S. interests in the Philippines date
back to the turn of the century when
the Philippines became an official U.S.

territory. But those interests have
become more defined since the end of
World War II, when the Philippines
became an independent state. and ex-
tensive business and trade ties between
the two nations have built up over the
years.

In addition. two U.S. military bases,
Subic Bay Naval Station and Clark Air
Force Base. are considered of vital
strategic importance to a U.S. presence
and posture in Southeast Asia.

Perhaps of primary concern to the
Reagan administration is the realization
that Marcos’ brutal rule has contributed
to the success of the insurgents in the
Philippines. In this analysis, political
corruption, blatant human rights viola-
tions and economic undcrdevelopment
have undermined Marcos‘ legitimacy.

Reagan, using the leverage of
withholding aid to the country. had
recently urged Marcos to reform his
government. Questions of Marcos’
legitimacy incited him to call for the
elections of today, a year earlier than
he originally intended.

U.S. and Philippines have long relationship

The United States has been closely

Relations between the two rest on the

tion in economic development, and
healthy trade and investment.

The United States is still both the
primary source of foreign investment
in the Philippines and the largest
market for Filipino goods. The Philip-
pines also houses the two largest

Money has been with us. since the
dawn of civilization and has pervaded
all facets of life. Not a day goes by
when we are not somehow affected by
money. Not that we need to be re-
minded of this, but the Pittsburgh
Center for the Arts, located at 6300
Fifth Ave., is doing just that — re-
minding us all that money has become
an all too important part of our lives.
Thirty-five works of every sort, from
painting to pottery, collage to
assemblage and even “living”
sculpture, make up this year’s Group
A exhibition, now showing until Feb.
23. While the media are diverse, all
works in this show have one common
theme — money. j

Among the many pieces exhibited
here is David L. Learn’s “Endan-
gered.” This assemblage reminds us
that in our insatiable desire for money
we are destroying our environment.
The piece is set in a green frame, the
color of both money and ecology.
Within this frame is an eagle’s foot, its
talons greedily clutching a dollar bill.

 

its purpose is twofold: As our national
symbol, the eagle represents we, the
people, while the eagle’s foot, here

reduced to a mererearview mirror or- ,

nament, represents the plight of the
eagle as its own species. Also within
the frame are a torn dollar, a
newspaper clipping regarding the
dumping of waste and the word
“poison.” Resting atop the frame are
trees, a songbird and the word “en-
dangered.” Learn’s work is self-
explanatory, effective and not for sale.

if you’re looking to purchase a work
of art, look at lrene Pasinski’s “The
Almighty,” a simple but successful
piece. A gargantuan black and white
replica of a $100 bill is cut into five
pieces which are mounted on the wall
in such a way that it appears to have
been shattered. Each of the pieces
contains simple statements written in
colorful markers. “How Much,” “Not
Enough” and “Mine?” are declara-
tions of our rapacious nature, while
others such as “Pretty” and “Good Ol’
Uncle Ben” are meaningless but serve
to deface the almighty dollar. This work
is a lighthearted social commentary

with a $400 price tag.

Webster defines avarice as the ex-
cessive desire for wealth or gain.
Dorothy Hutchins Forman embodies
this spirit in her wall-hanging sculpture
“Avarice.” We see the head of a terri-
ble green and gold cheesecloth mon-
ster jutting from the wall with insectile
eyes of coins, its tentacles at its mouth,
gorging itself with paper money. One
doesn’t need much contemplation to
understand what Forman is saying.
lronically,_ she appears to be among
the least avaricious of the show; her
work is only $215.

At the opposite pole is Alfred
Chancey, who stands to gain the most
with his bronze sculptures “Green-
back” and “Bullish Merger in the
Swineheard” which are priced at
$2,000 and $6,000, respectively.
Unlike most of the show’s participants,
Chancey does not choose to make a
statement about money, but rather he
creates visual puns. “Greenback” is
a relief depicting the muscular backs
of three men. The bronze is appropri-
ately colored green. His other work in
the exhibit shows the copulation be-

tween a sow and a bull. Chancey
manages to capture both the over-
whelming ecstasy of the bull and the
pig’s unyielding resentment through
his rough and unrefined manipulation
of the medium.

Perhaps the most successful piece
in the show is Adrienne Heinrich’s
“Trust in Me.” This installation con-
sists of a scarecrow-like figure,
shrouded in torn and weather-worn
garments, its hollow head made of
shredded dollar bills. lts wooded
skeleton is mounted in a semicircle of
stones which encompasses a back-
drop mounted on the wall behind it.
Done in soft greys and browns, the
backdrop adds to the viewer’s sense
of gloom and despair. The scarecrow
is a warning not to step over the boun-
dary of stones and into the clouded
storm that lies ahead. The message is
clear — the overconcern with money

To Adam Eisenstat, ‘

I take great umbrage with the
postulations of your “Rock ‘n’
Ramble” in Showcase, Jan. 24. In one
fell swoop you manage to reduce Live
Aid to a People Magazine papparazzi-
fest and Bruce “Walk on the Water”
Springsteen to the Joe Magarac of the
Wheat Belt.

The motives behind Geldof et al.,
could hardly have been based on
“Man, I be needin’ some publicity-type
action, pronto!” to prompt such action
from musicians and music fans
everywhere. While some have referred
to it as the “ ’80s Woodstock,” I prefer
to think of it as something altogether
different. Woodstock was drugs, mud

and the Flower Children’s last flatula-

letter 4

tion in the face of the Establishment (of
which they have now become and pro-
mote under the guise of the “en-
trepreneurial spirit”). At least Live Aid
was honest in its pretensions — have
a big concert, donate some money to
a good cause and create an Event.

As to Bruce — well, yes, he’s gone
full-blown in his workin’ stiff persona.
Yet, who’s to say it isn’t as much the
fault of the American public? They
wanted what their big brothers and
sisters had already gotten from Bruce
— 21/2-3 hours of rock ‘n’ roll American
style.

Woody Allen: pursuing the perfect cfion

By Matthew Yokobosky

Ever since Woody Allen debuted his
Annie Hall in 1977, he has been
synonymous with romance, death and
comedy. During his early years as a
comedian in the 1960s, Woody
discovered that the key for developing
audience understanding was through
the comedian’s/actor’s ability to per-
form through his own personality; in
that, if one performed as a comedian
rather than as a man extolling humor-
ous notions, he was essentially relying
on a plastic exterior to discuss realistic
situations. Comedy thus became
Allen’s vehicle for contemplating the
perils of life’s and love’s idiosyncracies
while allowing the audience to laugh
with him about his relationships and
obsession with death. For Allen, the
meanings and reasonings of daily in-
teraction must be realistic.

Opening tonight, Hannah and Her
Sisters examines the similarities be-
tween Hannah (Mia Farrow), Holly
(Dianne.Wiest) and Lee (Barbara Her-
shey). Filmed in chapters, each begins
with a quote titling the scene and
alluding to its particular significance.
In the first scene, “God, She’s
Beautiful,” the anxieties and securities
of the main characters establish the
importance of their roles within the nar-
rative. Hannah reveals maternal stabil-
ity through her marriage to Elliot
(Michael Caine) and their children; Hol-
ly thoroughly labels herself as an

unstable “single” looking for a hus-
band; and Lee quietly acknowledges
her attraction to the sexually overt
Elliot. From this quick introduction of
the main characters, the central story
line unfolds, developing anticipation
within every audience member.
When the name Woody Allen ap-

pears, you can almost be assured that
Allen himself has sewn a tailor-made
role into the plot. The third chapter,
“The Hypochondriac,” begins with
Mickey Sachs (Allen) as a television
producer being harrassed by his har-
ried staff. At this time, Mickey begins
to display his neuroses inhumorous
detail. From his initial plea for an ex-
amination, through his self-convinced

prognosis of a brain tumor, to his con-

firmation of impotence, Allen makes‘

light of serious health disorders and
recognized public fears. During a later
segment, Allen details his bout with im-
potence with Hannah’s and his friendly
appeal for a sperm donor, as if to say
that artificial insemination is just

another everyday occurrence. Why
shouldn’t your best friend donate his
sperm to your wife? is it immoral or
absurd?

Throughout Allen’s career, we have
become comfortable with his Jewish
religiosity and female rearing, as his
fear of death and sensitive portrayals
of women are recognized traits of the
self-exhibiting actor/writer/director.

Midway through Hannah and Her
Sisters, the chapter reads, “The only
absolute thought a man can have is
that life is meaningless — Tolstoy,”
upon which Mickey decides to become
Catholic. He tells his parents; his
mother cries. He decides to eat “that
wafer” and after returning from a com-
pulsory shopping spree, arrives home
with a crucifix, a picture of Christ, a loaf
of Wonder bread and a quart of milk
— symbols of the publicized worldthat
we believe are actually superior. But
after a brief interest in Hare Krishna,
Mickey realizes that it's better to live
now than to regret later. in a final se-
quence, “Why you wanted to drop out

of life,” Mickey states, “What ifthere’s _
no God and you only live once —— may '

as well enjoy it,” directly commenting
on those who complain and despair as
a resort from experiencing the follies
and foibles of living. Are our lives
self-designed?

In Annie Hall, Alvy Singer (Allen)
comments, “There were two Jewish
women eating lunch in a restaurant.
One looked up and said, ‘The food
here is terrible,’ to which the other
replied, ‘and such small portions’ ” -
Woody’s definitive definition of love. In
Hannah and Her Sisters, five relation-
ships are uncovered, each one bear-
ing a -resemblance to the others.

(Max Von Sydow) and Lee, Lee and

it could be the worst movie l’ve ever
seen. It was nearly, but not quite the
worst. What it wasn’t, however, was
funny. How, you may ask, could a film
starring Robin Williams not be funny?

   

 

 

Fiobin Wllliams

Well, it’s very simple. The script, for
one, and the director probably could
be held responsible in this case.
First of all, the story: Robin Williams
plays Jack Dundee, a banker who
wishes that he could live just one mo-
ment over again. Jack is obsessed
with a football game in which he drop-
ped the ball that could have scored the
winning touchdown. |t’s not just ‘Jack
who’s obsessed with that fateful day
12 years ago; the whole town seems
to know about his error, and no mat-
ter what he does he just cant’ seem to
live it down. Poor Jack. Nobody seems
to sympathize with him, much less
forget what he did. But then Jack
comes up with a plan. He decides to

it turns out that the two high schools
that played the game were archrivals.
Taft, the town where Jack's from, is a
working class town that’s had more
than its share of bad luck in the form
of natural disasters and disasters that
aren’t so natural. The big game
against Bakersfield was one of those
disasters.

The idea of playing the game again
is not embraced with great en-
thusiasm. Reno Hightower (played by
Kurt Russell), the greatest quaterback
Taft had ever seen, opposes the idea
strongly. Hightower, now painting vans
for a living, was the only quaterback in
Taft’s history to wear white shoes. “So

When Hannah and her sisters final-
ly meet alone in a restaurant, they
carefully argue the merits of their lives
but end in heated debate. What makes
the scene particularly exciting, though,
is Carlo Di Palma’s photography. With
the use of a circular track, the camera
dollies around the table and perfectly
entraps the sisters’ every interruption
and objection. Allen has stated in
numerous interviews that he prefers
not to disturb the fluid motions of the
camera and speech with editing, mak-
ing this scene technically and struc-
turally perfect.

hint may be found in its price — $525.

The theme of money has such
powerful implications that when one
sees an art show or anything dealing
with money he has certain expecta-
tions. He expects to hear and see
potential social criticisms. He expects
a highly emotional experience and he
and the material things life has to of-
fer is a certain death. Yours for $2,000.

In a lonely corner is “This is Embar-
rassing!” by David E. Nowicki, his
tribute to sexploitation. It is a box neat-
ly covered with a multitude of female
crotches and overflowing with money.
Various comments such as “This is
not art” and “By American,” along
with pictures of the presidential seal
and the president himself are pasted
to the exterior of the box. The box also
plays a barely audible recording. The
message of Nowicki’s work is so ob-
vious that the only thing left to guess
‘is how much money is in the box. A

 

expects to leave having learned some-
thing. All things given, this exhibition.
most definitely gives its viewers the
unexpected. The messages are there
but we don’t hear. in general the art

leaves us unemotional and indifferent. .

It doesn't force us to think about the

problems that money creates; rather,»

this unmoving art is content to let us
acknowledge the problems and simply
turn our heads unconcerned.

A major problem with the show is the
incorporation of money into art without

being too obvious. This seems to be »

an insurmountable stumbling block for
many of the artists. The second prob-
lem is the theme itself. While most of
the works do convey some criticism of
our society, these criticisms are
already cliches and, therefore, the art
seems trite. Money has been around
too long and its evils are all well
known. As far as money goes, what
has been left unsaid?

Dundee’s wife Elly (Holly Palance)
is not too thrilled about the game
either. In fact, she tells Jack that if he
plays that game once more he won’t
be sleeping with her in bed ever again.
Poor, dear, Jack.

But Jack, with the help of some
rather sneaky tactics, convinces the

' town to play the big game one more

time. He convinces the players to do
it. The complications arise when a
bunch of overweight, out-of-shape,
past—their-prime jocks decide to play
some football. Perhaps the film’s fun-
niest moment comes when Dundee, as
part of their workout regimentation,
leads the team through a rigorous

It would be wrong not to designate
this film as a “must see,” but perhaps
a lesser classification would be more
appropriate. Though the film does con-
template many delicate social issues,
it appears slightly too designed and oc-
casionally contrived. Allen’s role, while
lending humor to the script, is thinly

. linked to the film’s title, as if his inclu-

sion was an afterthought. Likewise, a
few irrelevant passages of dialogue
seem added to give the cameraman
the opportunity to create gliding
sweeps of footage; but nevertheless,

But that’s about as far as the humor
extends. There are several potentially
funny moments that just fizzle on the
screen. Although Williams and Russell
do their best with the material given,
there is just not enough depth or
creativity for the audience to laugh,
empathize or even grin. It seems like
squandering their talents, especially
when one recognizes these two per-
formers were chosen for box office ap-

tional personas. Though these are
minor discrepancies, one does an-
ticipate a flawless novel when the
signature is Woody Allen. A viewer ex-
pects and respects his encompassing
and exacting design and direction not
to be fooled. Though in comparison to
Hollywood’s usual glut of under-
developed films, Allen has possibly
over-perfected the art of filmmaking. It
is thus my decision to simply state,
“Woody Allen perfectly penned and
framed a portrait of Hannah and Her
Sisters.” »

Don Juan:a romantic ballet forValentine’s Day

By Dave Zuchowski

Starting Thursday, Feb. 13 and con-
tinuing through Va|entine’s week the
Pittsburgh Ballet Theater will stage
Don Juan, set to the music of Mozart’s
Piano Concerto No. 27 by
choreographer German Zamuel, who
is also PBT’s principle ballet teacher.
The program also features a Balan-
chine masterwork, Raymonda Varia-
tions and Stravinsky’s Petrouchka. The
Pittsburgh Ballet is offering a special
Valentine’s week price to students of
a 20 percent discount on prepaid,
bought-in-advance tickets and a 50
percent reduction for the Thursday
performance only, on tickets purchased
one hour before curtain call.

Don Juan is a collaboration of two
Pittsburgh artists, Irene Pasinski and
Kathleen Zambicki. Pasinski, an artist
and industrial designer, head of lrene
Pasinski and Associates on Centre
Avenue in Oakland, tells of her involve-
ment in the ballet. “As part of the 75th
Anniversary of the Associated Artists
of Pittsburgh, l headed a committee to
arrange an effort to have our visual art-
ists work with the other arts organiza-
tions in Pittsburgh, mainly dance and
theater groups. I wrote to all the artists
and members of AAP asking for
volunteers, and the ballet effort grew
out of this activity.” Pasinski is the set
designer for Don Juan, and after con-
sulting with Zamuel and Zambicki, the
costume designer, the trio determined
to give the ballet a stylistic air lying
somewhere between abstraction and
realism. Zamuel’s metaphor for the
ballet is a chess game as a love game.
Don Juan loves to play chess in this
tongue-in-cheek production, and
Pasinski uses the color scheme of a
chess board, red and black with some
gray and gold, in her scenic design.
She constructed a huge heart in the
background in a chessboard motif, a
visual reminder of the game being

emphasis. Her initial sketches were
reviewed by Zamuel and Patricia
Wilde, PBT’s artistic director who
thought that construction costs in time
and material would exceed $7,000,
and excessive amount for one of the
three ballets to be performed on the
same program. So it was back to the
drawing board for revision and
redesign. Zambicki labels her
costumes, again done in the red and
black hues of the chessboard, as
classical-contemporary, uniting a
realistic representative of the 18th.cen-
tury time period with an up-to-date
modernity.

PBT’s Don Juan has been given a
satirical twist by choreographer
Zamuel. As explained by PBT’s public
relations manager Georgeanne Bisset,
“The ballet is based on the famous
legend of Don Juan, and the
choreographer’s ironic attitude to the
tragedy envisions Don Juan not as a
rake and rogue, but as an avid
chessplayer. Women will not let him
alone, but constantly pursue him and
contrive to involve him in their amorous
desires. He eventually succumbs to
one of the damsels, and his punish-
ment for succumbing is to live eter-
nally.”

The role of Don Juan will be danced
by Pablo Savoye. in a discussion
with him about the character, he
disclosed that he sees Don Juan as an
introverted intellectual instead of the
feisty womanizer represented in
literature and the opera. Women pur-
sue him because of his physical attrac-
tion, but he’s basically indifferent to
their advances. He eventually
weakens and falls before Dona Anna,
whose intellectual prowess appeals to
him. ‘

Pablo describes Don Juan as

ing and acrobatics by the principal

IN THE BOOM BOOM ROOM
Studio Theater

By K.R. Van Aken

The Studio Theater’s production of
David Flabe’s In The Boom Boom
Room handles an aspiring young
dancer’s efforts to find her identity and
achieve her dreams in the cruel, seedy
atmosphere of a Philadelphia go-go
joint called The Boom Boom Room.
Chrissy, who begins her climb to danc-
ing fame during the glitz and glamor
decade of the ’70s and the “me”
generation, is brimming with dreams,
hope and ambition. Kelly Johnson as
Chrissy performs her difficult role with
powerful intensity and sensitivity.
Dancing is the one element in
Chrissy’s life which provides her with
an outlet for her creativity and gives
her satisfaction. However, she quick-
ly falls prey to her own doubts and in-
securities as she is sucked into the
seamier, exploitative side of urban life.

Trying to conform to the flawless
feminine ideal depicted in glamor
magazines, Chrissy begins her
desperate search for a man who will
love, understand and protect her. In-
stead, what she unearths is Eric, a
neurotic, self-absorbed product of
therapy (played with wonderful preci-
sion by Harry Bouvy), and Al (another
excellent performance by Richard
Keitel), an ignorant, footloose racist,
who has been left emotionally scarred
by poverty and a failed marriage. Both
of these men are focused so intently
on their own needs and frustrations
that they, like almost all the characters,
are indifferent to Chrissy’s growing
anguish at her inability to find her iden-
tity. She is constantly referring to her

horoscope in a futile attempt to put
order and meaning in her life.

But the stars are incapable of put-
ting Chrissy’s present or past in
perspective. Obsessed with the idea
that her mother tried to abort her, the
very roots of Chrissy’s self are at--
tacked. Her home life contributes fur--
ther to her pain and confusion; it is in-.
timated that her father, marvelously‘
portrayed by Timothy Meyers,
molested her as a child.

The working conditions in The Boom
Boom Room underscore the sor-
didness of Chrissy’s life. Dim, smoky
lighting, a mirrored sphere, infectious
soundtrack of ’60s and ’70s pop music
and tight polyester sequined costumes
help create the seedy atmosphere of
a go-go joint. The set is relatively sim-
ple, painted in bright purple, pink and.
orange. Scenes often flow rapidly into
each other with a a dreamlike quality.
Two of the five go-go dancers are posi-
tioned in the audience, effectively in-
corporating and implicating us in the
increasingly degrading circumstances
of Chrissy’s life.

Scene after scene of hysteria, pain,
confusion and rage have a numbing ef-
fect, inspite of Kelly Johnson’s intense
performance. Rabe has created too
many interesting characters to whom
he gives too many extended
monologues. He has crammed so
many details and so much action into
the play that finally the audience, as
well as Chrissy, are overcome by the
vulgarity, sordidness and obscenity of
it all.

/n The Boom Boom Boom will be
performed through Feb. 9. Shows
begin at 8 p.m. Admission is free to Pitt
undergraduates. The show contains
explicit language and nudity.

Reflecting

THE GLASS MENAGERIE
University of Pittsburgh Theater
By Erica Helbling

When it comes to Tennessee
Williams, l’ve never been disappointed
yet, and the current University of Pitts-
burgh production of one of his earliest
plays, The Glass Menagerie, proves no
exception. Less eerie than Suddenly
Last Summer and less steamy than Cat
on a Hot Tin Roof, Williams never-

» theless reaches to the very soul of his

characters in Menagerie. This, after all,
is an autobiographical play, in which

' Williams renders a less than idyllic

family portrait.

Amanda Wingfield and her two off-
spring choke in an economic and emo-
tional vise as each tries to cope in his
own peculiar way. Laura retreats
behind her collection of tiny glass
animals, whereas her brother Torn
seeks solace from his mother’s
hailstorm of criticism in the
movie theater. But as the powerless,
deserted wife, Amanda Wingfield at-
tempts to fuel her chi|dren’s ambitions
so that all three might escape from
their bleak existence, in post-
depression St. Louis. She is not even
marginally aware that her manipulative
ramblings will only drive her children
further away, leaving her with a heap
of shattered hopes.

The play rolls from Tom Wingfield’s
memory of events that led him to leave

his mother and sister, as his father had
done 16 years earlier. Mark Gruber
plays Tom with just the right amount
of irony and contempt, and under the
able direction of Kathleen E. George,
he steps from his reminiscing

mother’s economic
pressures.

Nona Gerard as Amanda spews
words with bite and wit, Southern
charm and pretensions as- only a

Katherine Hepburn could. Amanda’s

parasitic,

 

Laura( Tammy Bozs) and getleman ca//erw(AChristopher Jones)“

 
   

monologues into the actual scenes of
the play with the ease of a hat change.

Tom supports his mother and invalid
sister with his meager earnings as a
warehouse clerk. For him, the fire
escape outside the apartment sym-
bolizes a temporary freedom from his

litanies hover on the fringe of illusion
and reality. Her retreat to the “good old
days” of gentlemen callers serve to
mask her present-day isolaton and
helplessness. When business school
turns sour for her daughter Laura,
Amanda persuades Tom to bring a

on a glisteningGIass Menagerie

gentleman caller for his sister. There’s
no stopping Amanda now. Her feverish
preparations for the dinner guest mir-
ror her pent-up frustrations, now turn-
ing into new possibilities.

Jim O’Connor, the gentleman caller,
is the American dream personified. He
brims with confidence and enthusiasm
not even shy, lethargic Laura can
withstand. Christopher Jones might be
a bit too exuberant in this role, making
Jim less credible than he could be. But
in this very enjoyable production only
Tammy Bouzos seems miscast.
Laura’s glass ornaments underscore
her fragile character, thus this role
demands an actress of delicate
features to convincingly convey her
emotional state. After all, Laura pro-
jects her feelings into her animals.
When she tells Jim that her unicorn
feels like a freak among the other

horses, she speaks of her perceptions
about her own handicap. When Jim
establishes contact with his pep talk,
his kiss, he enables Laura to feel
human emotions previously foreign to
her, yet the poignancy of this" scene
never becomes fully realized.
Whether you‘ve never seen a Ten-
nessee Williams play, some or all of
them, you must add The Glass
Menagerie to your winter theater list.
Menagerie will run Wednesday
through Sundays at the Stephen
Foster Memorial through Feb. 16.

EASY PIECES
Lloyd Cole and the Commotions
Geffen Records

It seems that one of the major
fashion trends‘ of early 1986 is un-
fashionability. Less is more, and the
word is understatement. In popular
music, Sade or the Smiths come to
mind. The Smiths are a group led by
a man who once wore a hearing aid on
stage even though he has no hearing
loss. Morrissey’s goal was to present
himself as unfashionable as possible.
Listeners might then be drawn to the
band’s music and not their haircuts.

Lloyd Cole seems to have a similar
goal. First of all, he and his band hail
from Scotland and everybody knows
Scotland’s definitely not a happening
place. I mean, Bono (and ldon’t mean
Sonny) has made Ireland very cool, but
Scoﬂand?

As you might have guessed, on Easy
Pieces Cole plays it pretty straight.
Even though his instrumental lineup is
slightly expanded from his debut
album, his producers, Langer and
Winstanley, have helped deliver a
more accessible follow-up.

This accessibility is obvious as soon
as you drop the needle. “Rich” opens
with a clipped horn riff and a bouncy
melody which mocks the song’s
somber subject matter. The lyric is
about a guy wearing “newspaper
grey” whose wealth and power
became more important than his girl.
As the song ends with Cole repeating

 

The land of bland

ASTRA
Asia
Geffen Records

Random thoughts on a random
album:

it only seems natural to expect
something of merit from a band with

over 50 years of collective experience
in the music business. But instead they
offer the third in a series of piddling,
uninspired albums that begins with the
letter A.

Asia is sporting a new lineup, having
replaced Steve Howe with Armand
Meyer, formerly of Krokus and Cobra.
Actually, Steve Howe didn’t leave. He
just got a haircut and changed his
name to preserve the remnants of his
integrity; because whoever is the
guitarist, he will still be playing the
same drivel that was on the previous
albums. '

everything,

ya’ J know

Baby you’re a rich man over those
catchy horns, you’ll ask yourself if
you’ve heard that line before. The
answer to that question is “The
Beatles” and that type of deja vu oc-
curs again on “Grace.” This track
features a guitar solo that sounds just
like the kind George Harrison would
have played 20 years ago on Revolver
or Rubber Soul.

Easy Pieces hits its peak on side
two’s opener, “Brand New Friend.”
When Cole sings about Walking in the
rain with Jesus and Jane/ Jane was in
her turtleneck, the results sound like
Lou Reed meets The Spinners. A mix
that must be heard to be appreciated.

The only time the album drags is
when Cole tries to evoke compassion
for the title character in “James.”
James has a poor complexion and
greasy hair and fails to win over the girl
of his dreams. The music is dirge-like
and the words sound like Morrissey on
a bad day. But this is the exception.

l’ve got a feeling that Lloyd Cole
probably won't get a seat next to
George Michael at the Grammy
Awards later this month. This un-
fashionability thing isn’t that big yet.
But if the trend continues to grow,. a
refreshing album like Easy Pieces just
might have some impact on record
buyers. I hope so, since Lloyd Cole
and the Commotions does sound great
on a car radio.

JOHN MCCOMBE

Carl Palmer’s modern “four on the
floor’-’ drumming has degenerated in-
to a lobotomized thump.

John Wetton and Geoff Downes
once again get all the credit for

songwriting, or the lack thereof.
Though, it shouldn’t actually be called
songwriting. it’s more like self-
plagiarism of their past, not only
sponging off old Asia albums, but also
the bands they used to play in. Some
of the more obvious rip-offs are as
follows:
Dig for victory,_ go for gold

I don't wanna die before I get old. I

Pete Townshend) “GO” (ASIA)

achieves his lofty goal of making every
bandhe produces sound like Journey.

To my surprise, The Process of
Weeding Out is not merely another
small drop in Black F|ag’s ocean of

abrasive frivolity; it is, however, an
adventurous, just slightly indulgent,
treat for the more stalwart and hearty
among us.

dark message from a seething block
of instrumental jazz.-core. The ex-
clusively instrumental approach here
is surprisingly refreshing in the face of
former vocalist Henry Rollins and his
nihilistic soapbox. '

I would have liked to see what was .

left of Ginn’s guitar after this jazzy ses-
sion finally ceased; but I rest assured
that, despite any damage, he’|| con-
tinue to play it for years to come. His
continual twisting, tearing and ripping
of strings or “Ginn notes” may put
mileage on his instrument but it also
makes for hours of pleasant anxiety.
Yes, the cunning ‘sound that these
folks produce is worthy of note. In fact,
it often sounds like B.B. King in the
midst of a Jimi Hendrix Experience,

Drummer Bill Stevenson in
“Weeding Out” makes his second
mark on rock history by skillfully lulling
his acclaimed American Power Pop
percussion into a non-stop, deafening,
jet-propelled succession of drum rolls.
This guy will leave Neil Peart fans
gasping for air.

Kira, with lots-o-sweat and deter-
mination, pulls these two hardcore
masterminds together, for a wild ride
from Newport to oblivion. Her bass per-
formance isn’t as spectacular as her
colleagues’, but it is tasteful and  well
 it does the job.

For Black Flag, this is another big
step, and if the rumors hold true,
perhaps their last. But for National
Record Mart, it’s just another likely vic-
tim of the process of weeding out.

The album begins weakly enough
with “Manic Monday,” the biggest
piece of sugar-coated trash on the
album. Penned by Prince (a.k.a.
Christopher), all one can ask is “Why,
ma?” A: money. One would be in-
clined to believe that the rest of the
songs on the album could only get bet-
ter than this rather inauspicious begin-
ning. And they do. A little.

‘‘In a Different Light” is a spunky,
raunchy song with a pleasant chorus.
“Walking Down Your Street” has the
kind of lyrics that cause militant

be mildly interesting. The jangly man-
dolin inserted into _“Ode On A Grecian
Urn” works well, and the “Victory”
engaging chord progression, played
on a guitar that sounds as if it were
recorded from an overseas phone
hookup, proves listenable. The
album’s finale, “Mister White,” con-
tains the album’s most skillful lyrics,

But at least its insistent melody will

“Walk Like an Egyptian,” written by

dance beat. The lyrics combine Mid-

by the song about Jim Jones) and ap-

Written by the ever-popular adult
contemporary schmaltz team, Burt ‘n’
Carol, this song was originally re-
corded by Rod Stewart for the sound-
track to the movie Night Shift.’ Funny,

then, that Dionne Warwick should try
to just sort of plug in a new meaning:
The song suddenly is full of AIDS
metaphors. I don’t buy it. I mean, l’m
glad that the proceeds are going to
benefit AIDS research, a cause that
too many people try to downplay orig-
nore, but l’m offended by the cavalier
way that people have been using
music for social causes. Music is sub-
jective, and you can’t just dictate
meaning arbitrarily. I’d be even more
offended if this was a good song,
which, fortunately, it isn’t. Obviously,
I have yetgto resolve my philosophical
difficulties with the recent wave of
aural altruism that has infused popular

music, but l’l| let you know when I do.

and at such a breakneck pace that
they sound as if they’ll explode at any
minute. They do this, I suppose, to
hide the fact that their songs are pret-
ty dull, when you get right down to it;
but, as with most dance-old bands, the
song doesn’t matter —— it’s the beat
that counts, right? Sounds reasonable

Dire Straits: Walk of Life

Brothers in Arms, contrary to popular
belief, was not one of 1985's best
albums. It was fair to middling, OK at
best. The idea that it is still producing
hits a year after its release makes me
want to quit record reviewing and go
on a murder spree. “Walk of Life” has
been around for ages, so why is it just
entering the Top 10 this week? Don’t
get me wrong — this isn’t a bad song.
Neither is it a good song. It is pleas-
ant, listenable, uninspired, bland and
average, as is all of this band’s music.

Fa|co’s “Der Kommissar” was one

than a rather sleazy teutonic birdbrain
who was lucky enough to come up with
one catchy guitar line and have a hit.
Now Herr Falco has returned with a nu
— sorry, new — album featuring an
absolutely repulsive single that tries, a
year too late, to cash in on the Mozart
craze. While I like the fact that it
repulses me (it’s always refreshing
when something on the radio evokes
any response), the song is ultimately
just more evidence that the fate of any
innovation in music — in this case,
computer technology, sampling
machines and Trevor Horn ultra-
production — is exploitation to the nth
degree.

about dressier blues, what color suits
do execs in every corporation sport?
Good of’ blue.

By G.B. Patterson

Believe it or not, spring and summer
are just around the corner. And with
them will come the latest in fair-
weather fashions. After hours of tough
gossip and hard-nosed research, I've
fathomed the scoop of future seasons.
Simple blues will make a comeback.
in the USA, blue has been and con-
tinues to be the color. It is no surprise
then that new fashions have again
adopted blues, shades and tones that
have been classic over and over, sum-
mer to summer.

Think about your wardrobe. It does
not matter if you are male or female,
you can probably name 10 things you
wear on a regular basis that are peri-
winkle, royal, baby, midnight or navy.
The first item that might come to mind
is blue jeans. Sure, bleached jeans
were hot, and more recently print jeans
were the rage, but we all know what
kind of jeans will always be
fashionable —- blue jeans, the same
ones the president and the Spring-
steen wear.

The next piece of blue wear that we
all possess is the navy blue blazer.
This garment is the foundation of
men’s semiformal attire. Women utilize
the navy blazer, often with a matching

white on blue and blue on white will e _

l could go-on and on about the fine

. qualities of the color blue, but I think

 

 

The best attribute about blue is that
almost everything matches nicely with
blue. In the coming seasons, blue and
white will be an eye-catching combo.

you get the gist. What should be asked
is: Do we really appreciate blue,
dearest blue? What if blue wasn’t so
easily accessible in the rag trade?

At thestart of this column, I stated

that blue is the color of America, you
know — blue jeans, apple pie, mom
and Ron. Think for a minute if our
primary color staple were switched
with that of another country, say  In-
dia. Their dominant color is pink. They
wear shocking pink the same way we
wear blue.

Imagine yourself waking up in the
morning and slipping into a pair of cor-
al jeans and making your way to class
at Pitt, where the school colors are
fuchsia and gold. That afternoon you
have a job interview. What do you
wear? A rose suit, of course. That

evening you go down to the Civic

Arena to see a Springsteen concert.
lt’s sold out, and there he is. He looks
so cool in his white T-shirt and mauve
denim. 

But back to blue —— it’s the color to
wear thisspring and summer. And it’s‘
an easy color to blend with almost

' everything. One final note — if blue

were to be replaced by pink, then
sorority girls and preppies wouldn’t be
so readily noticed in our blue world,
making pink more accessible for those
who prefer not to conform.

Blue, blue electric blue, that [is] the
color of my room, where I shall [now]

go.

Things that go titter and
tatter all through the night

AND THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN
THE NIGHT
Laurel Highlands Regional Theater

By Susan Washburn

Take shelter. Protect yourself from
“it.” Find a friend And Things That Go
Bump in the Night may not be so
tedious. The playwright, Terrence
McNally, attempts to expose the
sinister evil and despair present in a
world where a nameless fear threatens
all. Unfortunately, And Things That Go
Bump in the Night loses its impact for
two reasons: the constant re-emphasis
on despair and the length of the situa-
tion — constant verbalization was not
necessary. Also, it appeared as if
McNally was attempting to convey too

many messages at once. The first two _

acts ran nearly an hour apiece.

The cast is not to blame for the
length; the pace they set was ap-
propriate. McNally should have further
narrowed his topic and credited the au-
dience with having some idea of what
was happening on stage without so
much explanation.

As for the Laurel Highlands
Regional Theater’s production of this
work, there were several highlights
and a few faults. Superb performances
were given by Roger Emelson and
Janet Robb. Roger Emelson portrays
an old thespian who is able to overlook
despair and find contentment in the
beauty of literature. He even attempts
to write his own book. Emelson plays
the part of this idealist with a quiet in-
tensity that is both appropriate to the

character and believable to the
audience.

On the other hand, Robb’s intensity
is anything but quiet. She enters the
stage full force and continues to
dominate throughout the entire pro-
duction. The show would not have
been complete had Robb come on less
strongly. The part requires an able ac-
tress who can exhibit emotions rang-
ing from a dominating contempt to a
desperate fear of death; Robb conveys
the whole range accurately.

Art Deconciliis was less dynamic
than his counterparts, Robb and
Emelson, but his character is quite ac-
ceptable. However, he does need to
vary his tone a bit more duringlhis
scene of conflict — when he must
decide whether he should go to the
above world and face “it.” Annie Ver-
nino’s portrayal of a 13-year-old girl
was quite strained and unnatural. Also,
her physical appearance did not sug-
gest a young girl -—_she looked too old.
Anthony Da|e’s performance as the
“friend” also seemed too unnatural.
He was supposed to be utterly
destroyed by the maliciousness of the

‘ AND SAVE AN ADDITIONAL

Showcase,’ Feb?uaFy' 7,. "1986-3'

 
  

By Adam Eisenstat

Last fall I traversed Europe for three
months at a blitzkrieg pace befitting
the postgraduate cliche these con-
tinental swings so often amount to. All
in all it was a wonderful time, a cultural
crowbar, a Beirut of the brain.
Europe, cheap and
character-laden as it may be, is a
veritable wasteland as far as my
chosen diversions of stage and screen
go. But Northern Europe, especially
Germany, Amsterdam and London
(skipped France) is just the opposite.
Too much for any culture vulture to
handle. When I got back from the
South, I really gorged myself, so here
follows some random retching and
outright blown chunks of Euromania.

I made my way south mainly through

"“’Germany where nationalities and

character traits are revealed at
stoplights. Foreigners, nihilists and
assorted radicals cross against the red
light if there’s a clear space. Good Ger-
mans on the other hand stand stock-still
on the corner, even if there isn’t a vehi-
cle within 100 yards. The trains are on
time to the very minute. They really
have dirt under control there too. Some
bloke who gave me a ride later in
Ireland said that if you go to a decent
hotel in Deutscheland with a dirty car,
they give you a hose and tell you to go
out back and wash it. He said having
a dirty car is against the law there.

I stopped at Berlin and went over the
wall (for a fee) and imbibed some of the
thick gloom of communism that has
spread over this showcase of socialism
for the West. More soldiers and police
in the streets than civilians. At the
Monument to Victims of Fascism they
do a goosestep changing of the guard.
is there a paradox here? The guards
with submachine guns stand in front of
government buildings and look so
deadly serious it's funny.

At one point in my three or four hour

"Adam’s Continental Blitzkrieg Part

trek around East Berlin l was sitting on
a bench with my feet up, drinking a lit-
tle bottle of Schnapps I had just bought
when some shrew came by and
started screaming at me. I just smiled
a wide grin and I heard her say, among
all the babble, the sole German phrase
I knew — “You don’t understand do
you?” My smile widened. Another time
I was dozing on a bench, not sprawled
mind you, just dozing. A policeman
woke me up and checked my passport.
“No sleeping” I think he said. Later I
took a leak in some bushes and con-
sidered it a political triumph.

violence, but I was impressed anyway.

When Wartoke, Frank Zappa’s or-
ganization for the betterment of rock
lyrics was ‘noticed, the year was 1985
and Congress had convened a session
on the subject of sex and violence in
rock lyrics. Censorship, Wartoke in-
sists rightly, is the desire to enforce ig-
norance. The tragedy of Wartoke’s
position is that vile, anti-moral lyrics
are patently offensive, regardless of
our right to censor them; too many
musicians have turned away from the
non-violent protest songwriting that
made the ’60s an era of joy and tears

On June 8, 1963, in Carnegie Hail,
Pete Seeger performed “A Hard
Rain’s Gonna Fa||” — and that hard
rain fell over Cambodia. A poster in the
defunct Shadyside Variety Store ll
said, “Chicken Little Was Right.” (The
sky fell in Southeast Asia.) Zappa, on
a toilet, chimed in his two cents in a

poster titled “Phi Zappa Krappa.” And, ’

needless to say, people were of-
fended, and they howled for misguided
youth to return to being docile and obe-
dient. All we were saying was give
peace a chance.

Today all we seem to be saying is
give us a chance to put our heads in
the sand and forget about it. I hate be-
ing didactic about an era that is prin-
cipally fun, but when I hear my favorite
radio stations playing music about
punching out nuns, I want to vomit.
The sensitivity of songs about peace
drew us together. And I wonder why
we entertain ourselves with puke these
days.

Formal protest in rock was not about
bitterness, it was about promise.
Nobody forgets, You may say that I’m
a dreamer/ But I ’m not the only one, yet
in hindsight most people probably do
think John Lennon was the only one.
He wasn’t. There were others like
Dylan, Seeger and Black Sabbath
(“War Pigs" by Sabbath is still one of
the top five heavy metal protest tunes);
and there were dozens of Woodstocks
before the tragedy at Altamont, which
pretty much blew the outdoor festival
as a peaceful event. The future of pro-
test rock shouldn’t be governed by
creed, but nevertheless, should re-
spond to prudence.

 

Prudence is the desire to sing rein-
forced by the knowledge that peace is
beautiful and something more. Peace
is the source of solutions, not the
resun.

The Free Peoples’ Store, now
Essex, was operated by a crew of hip-
pie volunteers, a very maternal group,
who were seeking independence and
maintaining quality products at very
low prices. This practical element of
youth culture was very important. Pro-

test is worthless without viable
solutions.

To criticize the youth movement, not
for acid tests, sexual excesses and so
on, but rather on the scarcity of prac-
tical idealists, is to acknowledge the
problems in the culture, while under-

standing that those youth were moti-
vated by a valid wish for healing, a
hope for real improvements in our
lifetime.

Ennui, boredom and complacency
are the masks of fear in our culture,
just as pride, arrogance and anger are
the masks of criminality. The hope for
better work, a more equitable society,

civil liberties, peace and justice will

never be lost.

The future of protest rock, sad to
say, is heading toward belligerence
and vileness for a time, but probably
will pass into a more hopeful rebirth of
the imagination, because the fact is
that freedom has yet to be found, and
it won’t be found in violence.

West: A challenge for the students

The Pitt News, February 7, 1986

\_ word ‘athletic’
 tionary. there would be a picture of

I remember the first time I ever saw
Villanova freshman Doug West play
basketball. It was last spring in the
prestigious Dapper Dan Roundball
Classic at the Civic Arena.

The Roundball Classic showcases the
best prep talent in the nation. Last year
was no disappointment.

I recall, Pitt was well represented.
Jerome Lane was there, so was Steve
Maslek. This was the same night that
I found out Tico Cooper would com-
mit to Pitt. Not a bad evening.

As the players warmed up for the
main event, a game which pits the
Pennsylvania All—Stars against the U.S.
All-Stars, Jerome Lane put on a show.
I said to a friend, “If you look up the
in Webster’s Dic-

Jerome Lane." By the end of the even-
ing, however, it would be the Doug
West Show.

West, you see. had a bevy of two-
handed gorilla dunks along with some
real nice inside moves. He really ex-
cited a sparse crowd.

When it came time for the media
members at the press table to pencil in
their choices for Most Valuable Player".
the majority of them voted for West.
In turn, he walked away with the MVP
trophy to add to his collection. He was
a Parade All—America, and was named
first team All-State.

As a member of the media, and I say
that loosely, I too was permitted to cast
a vote for MVP. Did I vote for Doug
West? Are you kidding?

It is still plain in my mind. In the

'3 Roundball Classic, West kept getting

these dunks off fast breaks and also had
some wide open jumpers. It seemed to
be the same kid everytime that was hit-
ting West with some fantastic passes,
setting him up for the points and the
glory. His name was Jerome

The Pitt basketball team was only 3-3
after their first six Big East Conference
games. But in all of the losses, the Pan-
thers played well, despite facing the

likes of St. John’s, Syracuse and

Villanova on the road. With four con-
secutive conference games at Fitz-
gerald Field House, this was supposed
to be the homestand for the Panthers
to make strides into the top of the Big
East.

But all things are not meant to be.

Something along the way to eliteness
went wrong. After Pitt nipped Boston
College, the Panthers blew a big lead
to lose to St. John’s. Then, last Satur-
day, Seton Hall flew in at 0-7 in the
league. but they left town a victor after
having shocked and embarrassed the
Panthers.

After the game, Pitt head coach Roy
Chipman said it was his worst defeat
ever at Pitt. So, to prepare for tonight’s
matchup with defending national
champs Villanova (16-9, 6-3), Chip-
man outlined a “get tough” policy in
order to get the players ready. '

Richardson.

Richardson, who goes by the
nickname “Pooh,” is a native of
Philadelphia. He told Rollie
Massimino, Roy Chipman and a host
of other Big East recruiters that Dick
Vitale is wrong. The Big East, in
Pooh’s mind, was not No. 1. Today,
he is the starting point guard for the
UCLA Bruins. Needless to say, I voted
for Pooh. I still think Richardson
should have been MVP.

One year later, this same Doug West

basket . . .

has had more of an impact on the Pitt
basketball program than Charles Smith
did last year. And he doesn’t even go
to school here.

It is safe to say that in the ﬁnal days
before Chipman’s resignation, the

Jim Urban

straw that broke the camel’s back in-
directly was West. All the repercus-
sions that came about after an article
that appeared in a Lexington, Ky.
newspaper contributed to his resigna-
tion. The article reported that West
claimed that a Pitt booster, Dr. Joseph
Haller, offered him $10,000 to enroll
at Pitt.

Chipman pointed to an incident that
was the ﬁnal straw when he resigned.
He said his son wondered if his dad was
going to jail for illegal recruiting.

to rattle Doug West

1. Wave money at Doug West
everytime he steps on the court.
That should catch his eye.

2. Everytime Doug West touches
the ball, yell D-O-U-G-I-E as loud
as you can for as long as you can.

3. Bring signs that resemble
enlarged personal checks. Make
them out payable to Doug West, for
a sum of about $15,000.

try again. ’ ’

With Pitt only 4-5 in the Big East,
this could be a do—or—die game for the
Panthers, and Chipman knows it. If Pitt
should lose, the season could be kissed
goodbye. But a win would move the
Panthers to within one game of fourth
place behind Villanova, and it would
generate some of the confidence that
the Seton Hall loss took away. Chip-
man has closed practices and granted
the press no interviews of his players.

“We closed our practices to get the
atmosphere ofjust us and the kids,"
said Pitt assistant coach John Calipari.
“It seems to have worked _in practice.”

With the closed practices, Calipari
said he believes that it will be easier
for the team to concentrate on a
weakness that has plagued them in the
past two losses.

“Offensively, we won’t make any
changes,” Calipari said. “We are one
ofthe top 15 shooting teams in the na-
tion. But we need work on rebound-
mg.”

Calipari said the Panthers have re-
bounded well offensively, but on
defense, teams are getting too many
second and third chances.

“Our problem has been a lack of in-
tensity on defense,” Calipari said.

“We need that intensity to win. Teams
have shot better in the last few games
because when they miss shots, they’re
rebounding the ball and getting easy
layups.”

' Villanova outrebounded Pitt 35-28 in
their 74-70 win at the Palestra on Jan.
18. Senior Harold Pressley pulled
down a game—high nine boards. It will
be both Charles Smith’s and Keith
Armstrong’s duty to contain him.

Rebounding is the key to beating the
Wildcats, but Calipari said it’s not the
Panthers’ only worry.

Villanova’s guards combined for 44
points against Pitt in the first meeting.
Kenny Wilson, a freshman point guard,
looked fabulous against the Panthers in
driving the lanes for 22 points. And off-
guard Harold Jenson was deadly from
the outside, as he, too, scored 22 points
on a eight—for-nine shooting perfor-
mance from the field.

“We have to prepare for their whole
team,” Calipari said. “Wilson had a
pretty good game against us last time
and we’re going to look to stop his
penetration. But you can’t just prepare
for -one player. If you stop Kenny
Wilson, Jenson will score 30, and if
you stop him, Pressley will score 30. ”

Wildcats into action tonight against Pitt.

Since that time, West has denied
comment on the allegations, and Haller
has ﬁled suit against West for defama-
tion of character. No surprise also, the
NCAA camped out in Oakland for
about two weeks late in the ﬁrst

semester, but nothing has been ofﬁcial- .

ly determined.

The thing that scares me is the fact
that the NCAA may still administer
sanctions against the Pitt basketball
program. The effects of Doug West on
the Pitt program may be long term -—
as in two years probation.

In the sense that what comes around
goes around, it is payback time.

I am issuing a challenge to the
students of the University of Pitts-
burgh. Tonight is your chance.

Pitt should have the same effect on
Doug West that West had on Pitt. Keep
it clean, and remain within the stan-
dards of good sportsmanship, but get
inside West’s mind to the point where
he believes that Fitzgerald Field House
is the toughest court to play on in the
entire country. It can be done.

West has started off and on all year
for the Wildcats, but do not expect him
to start tonight when ‘the two teams
square off at 8 p.m. Massimino may
not start West in an effort to keep the
fans off his back. On the other hand,
Massimino may start West in an effort
to show Pitt fans that Villanova will not
be intimidated. Nice try Rollie.

When it is all over tonight, Pitt may
walk away with a victory that can turn
the season around. The fans have
played a large part in some big wins
at the ﬁeld house in the past. Tonight
presents that same opportunity.

Bring plenty of money and wave it
everytime Doug West walks on the
court. That should catch his eye. After
the game, toss it my way. After all, if
there is one thing that journalists are,
that’s underpaid.

Wrestlers face

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh wrest-
ling team has quietly made a name for
itself among the ranks of the Eastern
wrestling powers this season. The Pan-
thers have remained rather silent.
despite the fact. they have marched
through their schedule disrupting the
season of several high—powered
opponents such as WVU, Lehigh, Lock
Haven and Navy. Pitt has survived
such a rigorous task well enough to
boast a 7-0-2 record.

The same cohesive Panther squad
will put that unbeaten record and their
No. 20 ranking on the line against the
toughest opponent they’ve faced thus
far. Pitt will make a mountainous trip
to Happy Valley tomorrow to face the
fourth—ranked Nittany Lions of Penn
State.

When the Panthers arrive, the valley
will not be happy to see them; and the
match is sure to be an action packed
cat ﬁght. Both teams are currently tied
for first in the Eastern Wrestling league
standings with 2-0-1 records, along
with Clarion.

So far this season, the Panthers have
proven that as a team they can beat
anyone. For Penn State, it will take a
big effort to hold off the tenacious Pan-
ther attack and no one realizes that bet-
ter than Penn State head coach Rich
Lorenzo. A

“I know they’re capable of beating
us if we aren’t careful,” Lorenzo said.
“If we don’t get all out performances
by all our guys we could ﬁnd ourselves
having trouble with Pitt.”

Pitt head coach Rande Stottlemyer
knows his team is roaring and ready to
go; and why not, the real pressure is
on Penn State. Stottlemyer is aware of
Penn State’s ability and feels his team
is ready to meet the Lions head on.

“We’re looking forward to the
challenge. They’re ranked fourth in the
nation, and that’s not something you
shy away from. They are very strong,
and they have several of the nations top
wrestlers.’ ’

Prior to the Pitt match, Penn State
is wrestling‘ a preliminary match with
the always—tough Michigan Wolver-
ines. No one knows for sure how well

I

the Nittany Lions will react. but both
coaches are certainly hoping inwilcl
work to their advantage,

“We're going to use it in a positive
sense," said Lorenzo. “We’re hoping
will get warmed up and wrestle well
again in the second match.

“We won't lose because of the
Michigan match. that’s for sure, but
rather because Pittsburgh will have
earned the win.”

Stottlemyer is hoping the double
match can help his squad instead. He
said,“I hope it will work to our advan-
tage. It will be interesting to See what
happens. Penn State is tough and it may
help them, but my feelings going in are
different.

"If it‘s a close match they may
become mentally and physically drain-
ed. It‘s the mental drain that could
really hurt them.”

No matter how Pitt should win. the
victory itself would be great. Co-
captain Kyle Nellis is ever so optimistic
and realizes what a great opponent
Penn State will be.“We definitely have
a shot at an upset. Believe me, it would
be a great upset. But. it’s not out of our
reach.”

A victory is not out of this
determined groups reach at all, but it’s
certain to be an up hill climb for a win
to come about. Many of the Panthers
are ready for the challenge.

Senior Eric Wertz has a clear
message for Penn State if they’re not
already aware of its context. “The
match will be tooth and nail. When its
all over with, they’ll-know they’ve
been in a match. This team won‘t stop
going at them,” said Wertz

So far the Panthers have not been
stopped, though they've been slowed
a bit. For the Panther victory wagon
to keep moving tomorrow, it will take
a combined team effort. The oppor-
tunity has risen, now the Panthers must
steal it away from Penn State.

“We definitely have a shot,” said
senior Joe Bond. “We have the
momentum. We have the opportunity,
before us, to beat Penn State.”

“Our guys know it will be tough,”
said a confident Stottlemyer. “They
know they have to wrestle their best
matches.

“Who knows, Saturday may be our
day.”

Panthers head to Olympic Invite

By Roy Bigler
Staff Writer

The men and the women of Pitt’s
track program will once again be split-
ting up into several different squads this
Saturday in order to attend more than
one meet.

The men will be divided into a group
consisting of Lee McRae, Rodney

Giles, Bob Weiner, David Moore and

Joe Daniels. They will be attending the
Olympic Invitational at the
Meadowlands in New Jersey, while the
rest of the team will be competing in
the Hardees Invitational at the Univer-
sity of West Virginia in Morgantown,
W.Va.

According to men’s head coach John
Vasvary, there are two reasons that he
is taking this select group to New
Jersey instead of to West Virginia.

First is the fact that this will be the
track where the Nationals will be held,

and Since both McRae and the two—mile
relay team will be competing in the Na-
tionals, this will give them a chance to
run on the track before the meet
arrives.

Secondly, Vasvary would like to ex- 1

pose his runners to the best competi-
tion that he can in order to improve
their performance. In addition, there is
added incentive for taking McRae to
the meet — to give McRae the chance
to be exposed to more people. “Despite
the fact that he is one of the fastest men
in America, he is relatively unknown,”
said Vasvary.

As for the Hardees Invitational,
Vasvary’s objectives here are relatively
simple; he just wants to set a new
record in the indoor shuttle relay. He
would also like to use the meet as a
building block for the conference
championship which is coming up at
the end of February.

“We are now starting to make our
big push for the conference meet,”
Vasvary said.

Joining the men in Morgantown this

weekend will be the Pitt women. This

will be the first action they have seen
in two weeks, and head coach Steve
Lewis said he thinks that the rest has
done them well.

“We had .a few injuries, but are
hoping to put them back on the track
this weekend,” Lewis remarked.

This will be the first time that the
women have gone to the Hardees In-
vitational with Lewis. He will be taking
the entire women’s team of 15 athletes
to participate in a wide variety of
events.

Lewis has several things that he
would like to see accomplished in this
meet. He is trying to make an evalua-

objective is going to be to help the
sprinters increase their output.

“We are going to give the sprinters
a tune—up by running them in the events

many of them had not been in,” Lewis
said.

As well as doing this, he is hoping
to put a shuttle relay team together, to

to take a look at the production of the

“The field will be very competitive,
and it will take a quality performance
to get to the front,” Lewis commented.

NFL Roundup

By Thomas Danyluk

A look back and a glance ahead

With their 46-I0 mutilation of the
Patriots in Super Bowl XX. the
Chicago Bears further displayed the
NFL’s long-time motto for its cham-
pionship game: Always expect the ex-
pected. Commissioner Pete Rozelle
should have bequeathed the Lombardi
Trophy to the Bears immediately
following their 21-0 rout of the Rams
in the NFC Championship. then flown
to Miami to give Ray Berry‘s cheinical-
ly dependent Patriots the NFL’s Good
Sportsmanship Certificate of Approval.
The Pats weren’t in Super Bowl XX for
a royal second ~ a Super Bowl, a
Super Bowl. my kingdom for an ex-
citing Super Bowl. Here are a few last
items before NFL Roundup takes a
seven-month time out.

The newest corps of NFL head
coaches has marched into duty. In
Houston. former defensive coordinator
Jerry Glanville has taken the rein ofthe
Oilers. replacing the expendable Hugh
Campbell. Glanville should turn this
struggling outfit into a contender with
his ungentle defensive schemes. .Ierry
Burns has been awarded the Minnesota
position. formerly held by the legen-

dary Bud Grant.

The Saints dipped into the USFL’s
assemblage of coaches and came away
with ex—Baltimore Star chieflim Mora.
Mora knows how to win and just may
instill some spunk into the nethermost
of NFL franchises. but it will take
divine intervention and a capable
quarterback to bring New Orleans back
from the dead.

The most publicized of this newest
wave of head coaches is former
Chicago Bear defensive coordinator
Buddy Ryan. Ryan. the mastermind of
Chicago’s 46 Defense. slipped out of
the Windy City shortly after the Super
Bowl to take the head position at
Philadelphia. Rumor has it that he‘s
now trying to sign cornerback Todd
Bell and linebacker Al Harris. two
brawny Bear free agents who know the
system well. One thing is for sure. the
Eagles will know how to play
roughneck pressure defense in l986.

Two other changes of interest: San
Diego recently named Ron Lynn as
defensive coordinator —~ does he have
his work cut out for him — and former

A great American
hero: Evel Knieval

This seems to be a time for heroes.

A few weeks ago the United States
paused for a day to pay tribute to Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.. and later this
month the nation will honor all great
Americans with a national holiday on
Feb. 21. Columns have filled these
pages in recent weeks with thoughts on
heroes fallen and those who never
were. On the icy morning oflan. 28.
seven more men and women, in a
single moment frozen in time. joined
the exalted ranks of those whom we call
heroic. Indeed, they are heroes of the

‘ highest order. forever young and lost

eternally into the mighty sky that
beckoned them.

There is little doubt that those peo-
ple mentioned above are supremely
qualified to be called heroes. King. the
astronauts, Lincoln and Washington
are now legendary ﬁgures who will
become even more mythical as the

Bob Travers

years pass. But often the qualities of
a hero are not so well defined. not as
obvious to the outsider. It is quite a
curious group of athletes who have
become heroic figures over the years
while having done remarkably little to
further their sport in any positive
fashion.

1,... Consider William "the Refrigera-

tor” Perry. Terry Forster. Bob Eueker
and the 1962 New York Mets. These
people appealed not because they were
extraordinary athletes but because they
touched us on a more basic level. one
we could relate to. We can't all win like
Tom Seaver. but we can screw up like
Marv Throenberry. These folks. anti-
heros if you will. have become a part
ofAmerica's sporting folklore. points
of reference a population of overweight
and under—talented fans could
understand.

One of my all—time favorite heroes
was like that. In my personal Hall of
Fame. along with the names of Roberto
Clemente, Willie Stargell. Franco Har-
ris and Syl Apps is the name of Evel
Knieval. And I wasn‘t alone. The Evil
One had built quite a following during
the ‘70s. Nobody was more taken in
by his daredevil stunts than my friends
and I.

Evel was the perfect hero for a young
boy with unspent energy and a mis-
chievous imagination. He never had to
“be careful" about anything. He was
the embodiment ofthe happy-go-lucky
adventurer. living at the edge of life
and never being more than a moment
away from death. But being so close
to death is exactly what made him so
alive and to us so exciting.

We all tried to be like him. In a scene
played out on dirt roads. driveways and
parking lots all over America. kids

would set up wooden ramps and find
something to hurdle their bikes over.
For us the jump was usually a pile of
leaves. rocks and sticks culled from the
woods around our houses. One night
we lit a pile of garbage on fire and were
planning to jump that. Unfortunately.
some parents saw the ﬂames and put
a quick halt to our stunt. Nobody would
have ever told Evel Knievel he couldn’t
jump something.

Jeez. we were stupid kids. Then
again, getting hurt never mattered to
us very much. Getting hurt while at-
tempting a jump was a noble wound.
something that would make mothers
cringe. but would make Evel proud. So
we told ourselves. Evel Knievel, they
said, broke every bone in his body. He
was still alive, after all. The thrill was
the same thing — and the danger. Get-
ting hurt was half the fun.

So week after week we set up our
“jumps” and watched the summer
nights blend easily into crisp autumn
afternoons. We would fling ourselves
repeatedly over the abyss. usually
crashing. rarely getting seriously hurt
and never wondering about life beyond
the neighborhood. And there was a cer-
tain success in safely landing on the far
ramp. wheels slamming back onto the
earth. But mostly it was just fun.

Like most other things in the ’70s.
Evel Knievel finally went too far. On
an April afternoon in the middle of the
last decade Evel tried tojump over the
Snake River Canyon in a souped—up.
manned missile. It looked like
something out of “Speed Racer meets
Star Wars." Well. the story was that
the parachutes on the missile—thing
opened too early and Evel went
harmlessly floating downward onto the
banks of the River Snake. After that it
was all downhill for Evel. He did some
time for assaulting someone with a
baseball bat a few years ago and the last
I heard he was trying to pass himself
off as a “serious artist.” I have a feel-
ing he‘s into the velvet prints of Elvis
that you see in K—Marts.

But for a time. in a more innocent
age. he touched a nerve in me. One that
called out to always be challenged.
always searching for the next achieve-
ment. the next miracle. It is that nerve
that many of us share. It‘s the one that
allows us to climb into machines that
will speed around concrete circles up-
wards of 200 mph. It is the feeling that
we need to risk our lives sometimes to
prove that we are still alive. With the
numbing atmosphere of the daily
routine drowning our creativity and
destroying our dreams, we need to
break out sometimes and take a chance.
Anyone who has answered the call to
a greater glory. anyone who has met
a challenge. is a hero. He is a hero and
a shining example of how a life is
meant to be ‘lived. Thanks. Mr.
Knievel.

Panthers swimmers hit the road

By Teresa Varley
For the Pitt News

After a week off, Pitt’s men’s swim
team will barely get a chance to come
up for air this weekend as they travel
to Cleveland State on Friday and Ken-
yon on Saturday to close out the regular
season.

The Panthers are currently 4-4 on the
season with victories over Virginia,
Kent State, Marshall and St. Bonaven-
ture. The Panthers’ losses came with
LaSalle, Penn State, West Virginia and
Villanova.

Friday’s meet against Cleveland

State will put the Panthers up against .

some tough individual competition.
Aidan Towey, a freshman distance
swimmer from East Germany, will lead
the Viking attack. He will be assisted
by Harold Wagner, last year’s Eastern
Champ in the l00—yard butterfly.

The Vikings are 5-6 this season with
victories over John Carroll, Case
Western Reserve, Notre Dame, Ohio
Wesleyan and Dennison. They lost to
two teams that the Panthers defeated,
Kent State and St. Bonaventure, and
also to Penn State, Ohio State,
Michigan State and Ohio University.

“There will be some good individual
events,” said Pitt head coach Fred
Lewis. “They don’t have a lot of
depth, though. They are not going to
be as tough as the last four meets we’ve
had.”

The Pitt divers, who have not been
seriously challenged this season, will
face some tough competition as they
go up against Rich Karbon, the three-
meter Eastern Champion in 1984. But,
as in all of the Panthers’ meets this
season, the divers have given outstand-
ing performances and should do so.
once again.

On Saturday, the Panthers will travel
to Kenyon to take on the 5-2 Lords.
They have posted victories over San
Diego, Miami, Dennison and South

Penn State

Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers were trounced by
the 14th-ranked Penn State Lady Lions
90-51 on Wednesday night in a non-
conference game at University Park.
The loss was Pitt’s worst defeat since
1978 when they were beaten 97-55 by
national power Old Dominion.

The loss dropped the Lady Panthers
record to 9-11 while Penn State im-
proved its record to 16-4.

Head coach Kirk Bruce was
dismayed by the loss. “We ran into a
hurricane,” said Bruce. “They played
a great game and they had it in high
gear. We didn’t play well. We let them
get too many uncontested baskets in-
side and we weren”t patient enough on
offense. We didn’t want to get into an
up—tcmpo game, but we did."

Kim Tirik led the Lady Panthers with
19 points and five assists. Tirik is cur-
rently seventh on the Pitt all—time scor-
ing list with 803 career points. Kim
Gannis scored 12 points, but shot a
miserable 4-13 from the field. It was
Gannis’ 20th straight game in double-
figure scoring for the Lady Panthers.

Vicki Link, Lisa Falcon and Denise
Chapman scored 14 points each for the
Lady Lions. Sophomore Suzie McCon-
nell dished out 13 assists and added 8
points for Penn State. _

and Ohio State.

“Kenyon will be tough in every
single race,” Lewis said. “They are
very strong in the 50- and 100-yard
freestyle. At the Michigan Invitation-
al they swam faster times than us
shaved. Also, their times shaved rank
faster than us.”

Competing for Kenyon in those
events will be sprinter Jim Born, who
has qualiﬁed for the NCAA Division
I championships. Born’s best time in
the 50 freestyle was 20.1 while his time
in the 100 freestyle was 43.47.

“Pitt has a strong team,” said Ken-
yon coach Jim Steen. “There should
be some good, competitive races. They
are a very fine team.”

dismal 20-57 from the floor (35 per-
cent), while Penn State hit on 40 of 66
field goal attempts (61 percent).
“They shot very well,” said Bruce.
“They came down court and put the
ball up quick. I don’t know if it_ was

our defense or just the fact that they ~

were shooting well.”
The Lady Panthers conclude their

. three—game road trip tomorrow after-

noon against Big East rival Boston Col-
lege in a 2 p.m. game. The Eagles
defeated Pitt 69-57 on Jan. 9 at Fitz-
gerald Field House.

According to Bruce. that game was
closer than the score indicated. "We
were only down three points with a few
minutes left in the game, but we made
a couple of turnovers and [committed]

Along with sprints, Steen feels his
team’s strengths are in middle distance,
in which Dennis Mulvihill is one of the
top competitors. He said they are fair
in diving and in the butterﬂy, but are
weak in the breast stroke.

As in a lot of previous meets, the
Panthers will rely on Donald Martin
and Rick James to spark the team’s at-
tack. The diving corps, made up of
Todd Mulzet, Jack Shuten, Vernon
Yenick, Chris Blair and Mike McCal-
ley, will also have to come on strong
this weekend.

The Kenyon meet will be the last
dual meet for the Panthers. They will
be competing in the Big East Cham-
pionships, which will be held Feb.

19-22 at Pitt’s Trees Pool. ’ "

some fouls that hurt us.”

Boston College comes into the game
with an 11-10 overall record and a 5-6
Big East mark. The Eagles lost
Wednesday night at home to Prov-
idence, 77-71.

Senior forward Marie Grant leads the
Eagles with 14.3 points and 8.9 re-
bounds per game. Sophomore guard
Ann Odoy averages 11.7 ppg and 5.1
rpg while junior center Kathleen Sweet
chips in with 11.3 ppg and 6.4 rpg.

“They’re a real physical team,” said
Bruce. “They pride themselves on a

tough man—to-man aggressive defense. .3;

Our man—to-man offense _is going to
have to get a whole lot better. We’re
going to have to be ready to play and
we’re going to have to do some blue-

The Pitt News, February 7, 1986

As I see it

By Jim Brueckner

Drugs and athletes: The wrong combination

I admire Patriots head coach Ray-
mond Berry. He is one of those in-
dividuals for whom we have the saying,
“Ifthere were more men like him, the
world would be a much better place in
which to live.”

Unfortunately, you also have men
like the Sullivans in the world. Con-
sidering all that I’ve heard about the
family that owns the Patriots, I thank
God that I have never known the
misfortune of those who have been
unlucky enough to actually meet these
classless people. They are not exactly
the Rooneys.

Super Bowl XX was a textbook ex-
ample of the current drug problem and
its potential effects.

Because of my dislike of the
Sullivans. I was not only rooting for
a Bear victory, but I prayed for a
blowout. As the fourth quarter began,
I was cheering for more.

My prayers were answered, but for
all of the wrong reasons. It wasn’t that
the Bears played a great game. If you
watched closely, you know that the
Patriots were lucky to only lose by 36
points. Both Payton and McMahon had
“off” days.

The Patriots were soundly defeated
because of drug use.

But onehof the major problems with
drug use in sports is that few men have
the courage that Berry exemplified
when he came forward about the drug
problem with the Patriots. Sadly, many
teams have owners like the Sullivans
who are uncaring and unconcerned
with the personal welfare of their
players. They would rather that the
whole matter just be conveniently
overlooked.

Drug use in sports is a serious prob-
lem and it’s about time that we take
drastic actions. Football season is over
and they have six months before the ex-
hibition season to deal with their prob-
lem. Let’s take a look at the world of

baseball.

Peter Uebberoth has promised to
tackle the drug problem currently
festering in America’s greatest institu-
tion since motherhood.

The major concern about drug use,
more than any other of its drawbacks,
is its exposure to the young athlete.
They are exposed to an element in
sports at a time when they are striving
to emulate their favorite athlete”s every
move. While it’s true that it is wrong
for these young athletes to be emulating
every move of their heroes, that is no
excuse for the league offices to give up
the fight. -

The fight that I’m referring to is the
most important fight in sports history
— the tight for mandatory drug testing.

It is what we need and athletes will
always be under suspicion until we
have it. What I can’t understand are
athletes like Larry McWilliams. He
must consider Pirate fans to be naive
morons. He has placed himself under
heavy suspicion because of a comment
made last season. He stated that he’s
not on drugs, he knows it, his family
and friends know it, so he’s got nothing
to prove to anyone else. Not only does
he now create suspicion for himself,
but he’s also saying that he has no
regard for the people who are paying
his salary. I hope that he gets booed
every time he takes the field in Three
Rivers Stadium. (Hey Syd, maybe he
won’t have to take the field in Pitts-
burgh. Hint. Hint.)

The sad part of it all is that
McWilliams may have never touched
drugs in his life, but you’d have a
rough time convincing me and a lot of
other people of that. Why would an in-
nocent man refuse drug testing? If I
were a player, I would beg for it to
clear my name. In fact, if I were of
George Brett or Don Mattingly stature.
I would threaten a holdout unless my
teammates agreed to a test.

We also need managers who can take
charge of their teams. I wonder why
manager Pete Rose, in one year, took
the Reds from being the worst team in
the National League to being a team
that was in legitimate contention for the
Western Division title up to the last
week of the season? I wonder why ad-
mitted drug abuser Dave Parker turned
his career around after Rose joined the
team? Say what you will about Rose’s
obsession with winning and being a
self-admitted sore loser, but these
qualities are what have kept him away
from drugs and in incredible shape.
This attitude has rubbed off onto his
players.

O.K., let’s face the music.

It’s almost impossible to believe that
Chuck Tanner didn’t know what was
going on with the. Pirates’ past drug
problems. Drugs were the main reason
for the Pirates’ downfall. The talent
was still there, but it was strung out on
cocaine. What really bugs me is that
Tanner never really did anything about
it.

Telling a player “not to talk to that
gentleman over there” is a waste of
time. Can you imagine Rose saying that
if a dealer made his way into Riverfront
Stadium? He’d have kicked his ass and
thrown him out personally! And you’d
better believe that any player seen
talking to the dealer would be
threatened with a suspension if ever
caught in the dealer’s presence again.
How can you even consider handling
the problem any other way? Managers
have to crack down if no one else will.

The major obstacle to solving the
drug problem in the major leagues is
named Donald Fehr. He is supposed to
be the player’s legal representative. He
is supposed to be looking out for their
best interests. My opinion of Fehr? I
prefer Hitler. Hitler was a more com-
passionate and selﬂess individual. He
cared more about his fellow man. He

respected the sanctity of human life
more than Fehr. I think Fehr would
push his own mother in front of a bus
if it meant a few bucks. I wonder if
she’s still alive?

However, I would like to state
something about an issue that is sure
to become a controversy. While I think
that it is time to crack down on drug
users, we do have to make one excep-
tion. The players involved in the drug
trials here in Pittsburgh cannot be
punished. They came forward and
damaged their own reputations in the
hopes that it would be for the good of
baseball. This gesture should not be
repaid by a suspension or a fine. On
the other hand, I think it is only fair
that they are also made an exception in
that they begin mandatory testing this
season even if no one else does. This
seems to me to be fair to both sides.

This whole situation reminds of an
excerpt of the Merle Haggard song
“Are the Good Times Really Over?"

1 wish coke was still cola.

And a joint, was a bad place to be.

Cassidy an unexpected find for Pitt

By Brooks Thomas
For the Pitt News

Success isn’t always measured by
how fast you can run or how high you
can jump. The University of Pittsburgh
women’s swimming team is full of suc-
cess stories. The team is riding a 20-
meet winning streak dating back to last
season. Sue Hickman is striving to
become the fifth Lady Panther ever to
reach All—America status four straight
years. Marian Cassidy may not be an
All-America, but she is one of the big-
gest success stories on the team.

Cassidy. a sophomore from Wil-
mington, Del., was discovered by head
coach Dave Belowich at a Junior Na-
tional meet.

“I was down visiting a friend who
coached the Wilmington Aquatic
Club," said Belowich. “I was watch-
ing his team compete in a relay. It was
late in the morning and it was the last
heat. It wasnt anything of real conse-
quence. I saw this girl who anchored
the free relay for them. I didn’t know
who she was but, boy, did she move.
It was a tremendous performance in
what was not an exceptional relay. I
asked my friend Steve after the meet
who that girl was. He got puffed up,
and replied by saying that was his
sister."

Belowich continued to monitor
Cassidy’s progress throughout her
junior and senior years at Ursuline
Academy. Her hard—working attitude
and physical tools convinced Belowich
to recruit her. At first Cassidy wasn’t
too impressed with the University of
Pittsburgh.

“Coach Belowich was the main
reason I visited,” said Cassidy. “I real-
ly didn’t know anything about the
school, so he invited me up for a visit
and I said, ‘Pittsburgh, oh yuck!’ He
did have a genuine interest in me, so
I figured I might as well give it a shot.
When I came up here for my recruit-
ing weekend, it was completely op-
posite of what I had pictured. I liked
the school, swimming program and the
girls on the team.” .

Cassidy is an outstanding freestyler,
according to Belowich, and placed in
several events at last year’s Big East
Championships. She not only has great
athletic ability but she is also a team
leader. “Marian is a very giving kind
of individual,“ Belowich added.
“That’s part of our team concept. Like
in many other years, the energy level
of the team is greater than the sum of
all its parts. She accepts challenges
very well. She trains hard. She gets
along with the other members of the
team. Marian is what you want and a
real good person to build a team
around.”

Not only did Belowich land a tal-
ented swimmer when he signed Cas-
sidy, but he also got an exceptional
student. Cassidy never received a grade
lower than a “B" in high school which
helped her earn a Provost Scholarship.
The scholarship is maintained if the stu-
dent ean carry over a 3.0 grade point
average or better. She is majoring in
biology and plans to continue her
education upon graduation.

Belowich recalls a time when Marian
needed an “A" in calculus and a “B
plus” in English writing to retain her
scholarship. On the first day of her
English writing class, her instructor ad-
vised the students that she had never
given out an “A” before. At the con-
clusion of the spring semester, Cassidy
hunted down and telephoned Belowich
at swimming camp in Virginia with the
good news. She had gotten an “A” in
both courses.

The coach and his student share a
special relationship. “We get along
very well," said Cassidy. “He has a
lot of the same interests as I do. I ap-
preciate his school related concerns that
he puts forth to me and the rest of the
team. It means a lot to me to have a
coach that is concerned about that.”

The Lady Panthers are ranked No.
1 in the East. Cassidybelieves that
much of the team’s success is attributed
to teamwork.

“We’re doing a greatjob this year,”
Cassidy pointed out. “It’s really neat

 

how close we can all get when we come
to the meet. Against Penn State, it was
an incredible experience for the whole
team. Everybody gave it everything
they had. Whether you’re scoring or
not, everyone was cheering and pull-
ing for each other. Beating Penn State
was one of the most memorable mo-
ments of my career.”

If Cassidy doesn’t make All-America
it won’t bother her. She is a team per-
son all the way. As long as she gives
100 percent and the team keeps winn-
ing that will suit her just fine. You
can be sure of one thing, if Cassidy is
giving 100 percent, the team will be
winning’ and Coach Belowich will be
very pleased.
