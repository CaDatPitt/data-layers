For Evidentuary Hearing

by SCOTT MacLEOD

Dr. Nan Pendrell was in Pitts-
burgh last. week to attendan evi-
dentuary hearing in her civil suit
against Chatham College.

Pendrell is the former Chath-
am professor released in 1972
in what the college termed "a
normal retirement procedure."

Since that time she has filed
suit in Federal Court of Western
Pennsylvania charging the school's
administration with age and sex

descrimination and refusal of due '

process of law.

An evidentuary hearing is a pre-
trial investigation used to deter-
mine certain admissible evidence
and correct process procedure.

In the Pendrell case, the evi-
dentuary hearing will decide
whether or not Chatham is a
state related institution. The
school authorities claim it is not.

By the recognition of the state.
Chatham is not legally state re-
lated. but is instead a private
women's college, However.
Pendrells attorney's James Lo-
gan and Hymen Schlesinger
have set out to prove that Chath-
am. like many other private in-
stitutions. receives a substantial
allotment of state appropriations
and benefits. and therefore.
should be reclassified as a pub-
lic school. ‘ ‘

In the evidentuary hea-ring last

week, Pendrells lawyers cited’

Land Zoning Use. Property Ex-
emption,~ and use of ‘ Municiple

services as Chatham’s state bene-
fits.

Sources close to Pendrell men-
tioned the construction of the
multi-million dollar Mary Chase
Mellon library as a direct state
appropriation to a state school.

. in this case Chatham College.

Pennsylvania is helping consid-
erably with the financing.

The sources also mentioned
that these allowances are com-
mon to all private institutions. but
that ruling is unconstitutional.

A victory in Pendrell’s eviden-

tuary hearing would set a prece- _ .

dent in private institution suits
across thenation. It would mean
reclassification of most private
colleges and universities.

For Dr. Pendrell, victory would
mark a fine beginning in» her
suit against Chatham‘College. A
favorable decision handed down
by the Honorable Judge Tietal-
baum will move Pendrells case
into Federal Court. with _the
possibilities of a jury trial.

Students Fight City Meters

by DAVE MAJERNIK

A group of students from the
School of General Studies are

feuding with city officials over

the time limit of parking meters
surrounding the Cathedral of

,« Learning.

The evening students contend
the two-hour meters are a hard-

 

ship because their classes last
two hours and 40 minutes. Conse-
quently. students using these me-
ters must either leave during
class to feed the meters. or risk
the chance of being ticketed and
paying a $2 fine.

Self-awareness. body discipline. and the quest for higher levels of
consciousness are only some of the phenomena that man has occupied
himself with for years in order to better understand himself.‘

More recently. a heightened interest in ESP. psychic phenomena.

and encounter group sessions has resulted in scores of books. maga-.

zines. lecturers. and television series all dealing with the man'y facets
of the sometimes mysterious "psychic sciences."

January Foundation, Inc., is a local organization that is a kind of
central point for all of the information being distributed about our inner
selves and much of the hidden powers we possess.

According to Scott Ogdenfexecutive vice-president of January
Foundation. "The organization is established for educational and in-

"These "Life Sciences" refer to acquired knowledge. techniques
and abilities inherent in the human psyche and how to motivate. devel-

formally charged with rape.

The suspect allegedly forced his
way into the Tower C room of a
Pitt coed shortly before 1 a.m.
Saturday and attempted to assault
her sexually. The woman succeed-
ed in forcing Walker from the
room and locking the door.

Walker allegedly knocked on
another door further down the hall
on the same floor. When the vic-
tim opened the door he is report-
ed to have grabbed her by the
throat until he was able to gain
entrance.

Once in the room. Walker al-
leged to have raped the victim and

forced her to commit other sexual
acts; she was told that a failure
to cooperate on her part would re-
sult in her death.

Before leaving, the suspect ex-

pressed a desire to return. The_

victim, in hoping to set a trap for
her attacker, encouraged him to
call her the next day.

Walker allegedly left the wom-
ans room at 3:30 a.m. Saturday
morning. She remained in the
room until the following morning
until she heard activity on the
floor. She then ventured.into the
hall and telephoned the Campus
Police.

Local Group Organizes

Ex-ACTION Members’ Skills Utilized   P

The Independent Foundation
ilFi. a national organization that
represents former ACTION volun-
teers. held its first meeting in
Pittsburgh to organize involve-
by former volunteers in
solving local social problems.

IF. a non-profit organization
based in Washington. D. C.. met
with former ACTION (Peace
Corps and VISTA) volunteers and
representatives of Environment:
Pittsburgh (E:Pi to form a lia-
son relationship to deal with local
environmental issues.

The environmental project
would combine the skills and ex-

perience of the former volunteers

with those of local environmen-

 

Webster Knight. national spokes-
man of IF. explained that the idea
of IF originated in 1969. when
several former Peace Corps vol-
unteers realized that 97.000 for-
mer volunteers were home from
their assignments and that their
training and skills shouldnt be
wasted.

He explained that "projects in

:other cities dealing with such is-

sues as consumerism. day care
centers. free clinics. and tenants‘
rights unions have been success-
ful in operation with the help of
former volunteers."

Bob Kambic, local co-ordinator
of IF, along with David Marshall

of E:P, .agreed that former vol-

‘I:/.

chairman of the parking task
force, charged at a Parking Me-

_ter Symposium June 6 that the

city has changed only '54 of 278

change to four-hour meters.

However, City treasurer Joseph

“He (Greenberg) is not going

to get anything done unless he

Cosetti contended that he would ,3

tant issue.

‘‘We’ve had a lot of experience
with meters,” said Cosettil “Of-
ten when we change the time of
meters, it does not benefit the
group requesting the change.”

He said that if the meters around
the Cathedral were changed to
four hours. Pitt statl members
would probably start using ,_ihem
and then General Studies students
would still nol be able to park
there. _ P

Cosetti suggested the Univer-
sity provide shuttle bus service to
the school—owned parking lots in
Panther llollow and on Allequip-
pa St.. and that those lots be pa-
trolledat night by campus police

to insure the security of the stu-’

dents.

Providing parking facilities for V

all Pitt evening students, he said,
is not the City’s responsibility.
Manystudents, who could use pub-
lic transportation, insist on com-

ing to Oakland in automobiles,
thus adding to the parking prob-_

lems. The City is not going to en-
courage such an attitude, he said.

sponsible administration._

 Republican Senator Richard
 . Schweiker of Lansdale. Penns_vl-

 vania.

"SCHWEIKER. Well, I think

to political pressures in any ad-

these “future Water-

sonal
it?

SCHWISIKER. Well. there is no
doubt I'm on the list because
I've been my own man. l‘ve al-
ways voted my beliefs and con-
victions. I think the real tragedy
of Watergate is that we had
White House staffers who spent
more time putting together hate
lists and figuring how they were
going to come up with petty re-
prisal schemes as opposed to ad-
dressing themselves to they real
problems like high food prices.
inflation. health. education. and
energy. I think we have come an
awful long way from the cam-
paign slogan of 1968 where we
said "Bring.Us Together‘. Its
tragic that we didn't sit down-
Senators. Congressmen. White
House personnel—t-o work out the
problems jointly. They‘re that
serious. _

Why didn’t the Senators, Con-
gressmen and White House per-
sonnel sit down together?

SCHWEIKER. Well we actually
tried to on any number of occa-
sions but the White House didn't
want to work that way. We were
denied access to the ‘President:
we were not consulted in ad-
vance on bills that would come
out of our respective committees
on mattersof policy that effect-
ed our respective committee as-
signments so that we were thwart-
ed in every way in terms of dir-
ect communication and in terms
of sitting down jointly and work-
ing these problems out together.

political]; implications of

What are the political implica-
tions of that black list for you

' personally?

SCHWEIKER. I do not know
if there are any real personal im-
plications. I do see a change in
attitude at the White House now.
Mel Laird who was formally a
Congressman has gotten rid of the
paranoia and the fear and the

persecution complex envisioned by

some of’ the White House staffers.
So I think he's turned over a
new leaf. This has begun to
open up communications so I
don‘t see that kind of thing hap-
pening in the future. As far as
my own situation is concerned.
I don‘t think its really had much
effect on me personally. because
White House liason and relation-
ship with the Hill waslso bad and
did such _a miserable job that
they didn‘t descrimminate be-
tween the guys in the white hats.
and the guys who are on black
lists. They were equally bad to all
Senators. Republicans or Demo-
crats. good guys or bad guys. so

-I didn’t see’ that much difference

in the treatment I got than the
treatment the people who went
100 percent down the line got.

How are the people back in
Pennsylvania going to react?
Will they distrust you because
you are an “enemy” of the White
House?

SCHWEIKER. Well. I think
this just reinforces my whole phil-
osophy and political profile. I
got started in politics as an in-
dependent Republican. I had to
win a primary withoutparty sup-
port to get my credentials as a
Congressman. When I ran for the
Senate in 1968 I said I would be
a man of independent judgement.

"So this list has confirmed the fact

that I've lived up'to my cam-
paign promises and lye been the
kind of guy I said I would be.
which is my own man.

The President has said that it
would “constitutionally inap-
propriate” for him to -appear be-
fore an investigative committee.
How do you feel about his deci-
sion in light of Chief Justice

. John Marshall’s decisionin 1807?

— may

 

SCHWElKl:3R. Well. I think
theres two aspects of it. the le-
gal and the political. There is pro-

bably a debateable legal case
which you could make either
way. But I think far more im-

portant to me is the political as-
pects of it. We have a nation
that is beseiged by a crisis of
confidence in its leaders. The only
way to get the political initiative
is for the President to take it
upon himself to come to the coin-
mittee and appear. Unless he does
that we are going to fiave a con-
tinuation of this political confi-
dence problem. So. I certainly
feel strongly that for his own
political sake and for his own
leadership credibility problem
he should ignore what ever poli-
tical ramifications there are a_nd
come to the committee.

What are those legal ramifica-
tions?

SCHWELIKER. They are pro-
bably debatable. Abraham Lin-
coln saw it upon himself to come
to the House of Representatives
in 1862 on a matter. I think you
can read these either way. I do
not think there are valid legal
reasons for withholding docti—
ments and papers that have bear-
ing as evidence in this case. That
is stretching the imagination in
those terms. The matter of the
President appearing is probably
more debatable. but I don‘t
think the problem is a legal
matter. but a political credibil-
ity matter.

Do you think the ‘President
will appear?

SCHWEIKER. So far its dis-
couraging. Again. I think with
new people. a new group of ad-
visors around the President. he
well change his mind—:
but that's only guessing.

Senator Schweiker, if the Pre-
sident were impeached or brought
before the Watergate Commit-
tee by subpoena, would it weak-
en the Executive arm of govern-
ment?1

SCHW'EIKI:JR. Well. I feel this
way. As a United States Senator.
under the Constitution. if charg-
es are brought against any Pre-
sident or this President in parti-
cular. I‘d have to make a judge-
ment about that. in terms—of not
being a legislator any more. but
a judge." So I have scruptuously
refrained from answ_eri_ng all
questions about impeachment
because I think that would pre-
judice my role as a judge if I'd
have to exercise it. I would
honestly decline to answer that
question because I don‘t want to

prejudice a judgement I might

have to make about the Presi-
dent.

Theoretically, if the President
were to be placed in a position

of being subpoened or impeach-_

ed, would this create an imbal-
ance of power?

SCHWEIKER. Let me say this.
That has already happened in the
Watergate affair. In other words.-
we have at last imposed some
limit on the Cambodian bombing.
I didn‘t vote for the compromise
because I felt one day of bomb-
ing in Cambodia was not proper
and was not legal. But the fact

 

‘l. . . but the White House
didn’t want.to work that way.”

that Congress has at long last.
voted a majority to cut off all
military action in Indochina is
significant. I think a number of

things have indicated that the

balance of power has already be-
gun to shift. So I believe that
Watergate. regardless of what
happens; after this. has already

 

begun that process. ‘which I
think is healthy. Since World
War II we've been going too
much for Executive power and
Congress has been advocating too
much of its own powei

cutive Crisis

 

of’ candidacies and probably no

one has an inside track. It is

healthy and good for the party

to fiave an open contest and a
hard fought fight for the nomi-

 
 

‘‘I think that Watergate has caused all of us to perhaps exert
more leadership in the party,/with the leader of the party now
in the White House.”

  

As you know Senator, some
people have accused some Demo-
crats and the news media of be-
ing too critical of the. Nixon ad-
ministration in this time of crisis.
What is the media's role in
this situation and how do the
Democrats play the role of the
loyal opposition?

SCHWEIKER. By and large. I
feel both the media and the dem-
ocrats have handled the, situation
fairly. I think the only reason
the media has been able to make

the revelations that it has and _

come up with the news scoops and
stories is because the Administra-
tion has been restrictive and has
closed access to these facts and
relevant discussions. If the Ad-

ministration from the beginning,

of Watergate had been an open
book and had permitted free and
open access to the facts and re-
levent data to Watergate. the news
media wouldn't have anything to
write about today. So to a great
extent it has been brought about
by the "sweep-under-the—rug-ap-
proach" of the Watergate affair.
I think that's a tragedy. People
are very understanding and
charitable and if they‘re given the
facts in a clean. straight-f'oi=
ward approach they'll make a
judgement that will be very
charitable.

Senator, now that the Repub-
lican party is in the wake of a
crisis, is this the time for you to
move forward to be a leading re-
publican by 1976?

SCHWEIKER. I think that
Watergate has caused all of us
to perhaps exert a little more
leadership in the party with the
leader of the party now in the
White House. We have to be out-
spoken. We have to be direct.

”"‘We have to tell the people in the

country where we stand on Wat-
ergate. We have to tell the peo-
ple what our ideas on the future

of"’the country are. what prob—_'

lems we ought to be solving. I
think that frankness and caiidor
here is extremely important if
we are to restore the credibility
of the Republican Party to the
electorate. At this point I, think
the Presidential race in ‘T6 is
wide open. Anything goes in terms

sand we've only

nation in
gate probably has caused this.
It's one of" the indirect benefits
of the tragedy. ’

You have been described as a

 

. “practical idealist.” If you- are

re-elected to the Senate for -six
more years and possibly six more
after that, "what are you hoping
to_accomplish?

SCHWEIKER. Well. there are a
number of problems here. but
one of the most important is re-
storing the faith of the American
people in our political process.
We have to eliminate the poli-
tical fund raising and chicanery
that went_on in the Watergate so
the people feel once again that
they are part of‘ the political
process and so they feel that it's

just not a few big rich contribu- -

tors who control things. We have
got to open up our election pro-
cess so that every body partici-
pates widely. We must getinto
solving our energy crisis prob-
lems. which we haven't; our
health and education problems
— I‘m on the Health Committee
scratched the
surface on the costs of medical
care and things .like this. So.

' there is a "whole realm of prob-

lem_s and programs that we’ve
just begun to get started on.

Senator Schweiker, do you
-have anything you would like to
add?

S(,‘HWEIKI:)R. Well. I think

its vital to tell the students that
in spite of Watergate our politi-
cal system is working surprising-
ly well. It's important to point
out that it was a free press that
kept the Watergate issue alive

until the facts became widely-
.known. All the American institu-

tions were functioning properly
outside of the Presidency to
make up for the deficiencies of
the White House staff. That is
the encouraging sign about 'the
Watergate episode. I think it
means. '.too.. that young people
should not be discouraged by
Watergate. but it should offer

them a stimulus to participate 4

more in the system. to do a bet-
ter job than we"ve done in clean-
ing up and reforming and cliang—

. ing our system.

Letter To The Editor

Dear Editor’:

This letter is an appeal to all
the democratic torces in the aca-
demic and civil communities
against gross violations and abus-
es by Dean Jerome Rosenberg
and Chief Fela Sowande in col-
lusion with some reactionary
laculty members of the Depart-
ment of Black Education Re-
search and Development.

The lirst violation is that of ex-
ercise of my democratic right to
vote. By 11-4 vote the l'acult_\'
ol DBCl:1l{D recommended Mr.
Curtiss Porter against Chiet Fela
Sowande to become the acting
Chairman of the Department.
Dean Rosenberg overturned the
decision and installed the Chiel
thereb_\' ignoring my in—put and
denying me the right to opinion
since I voted with the majorit_\'.

This gesture not only under-
mines my integrity, but is also a
violation of the autonomy of
academic departments regarding

hiring, promotion, and rank-at

democratic practice which has
now become the convention in
higher education institutions all
over the United States including
the University of Pittsburgh. ‘

Dean Rosenberg and Chiel
Fela Sowande have also violated
academic and human standards
by proposing to force all teach-
ers in the department to teach
t‘air_v-tales. sophistry. and m_vsti-

cism such as reincarnation. This .
program was published and cir- .

culated by Chief Fela Sowande
under the title: “Educational
Philosophy of the Department of
Black Studies of the Universit_\'
of Pittsburgh."

They have also proved to be
racist autocrats since they have
imposed on us and have planned to
impose teaching ignorance in-
stead of knowledge on us. In the
above mentioned program, for ex-
ample, we ‘find on p. 7 such ra-
cist cliches as: “Black people
are more motivated by feeling
than by thought”, ‘‘Black people
think with their intestines”. The
above gross abuses and. violations
not only against me and the
black people, but against the
rights, decency, truth and know
ledge of humanity must not be
left unexposed and insufficiently
dealt with. Workers and students
whose interests the university is
supposed to serve must ask why
their money is being “invested”

in teaching mysticism, sophistry ‘E

and racism, and why minority

lackeys and quacksin the depart-,

ment support this.

BALTIMORE (AP) —\ An off-

. track loss by super horse Secre-' ‘
tariat may .be remembered as

long as his 1973 c1ean_sweep of
racing’s'Tr_ipleCrown,. ' ‘

The great Man 0‘ War was dealt

his onlyidefeat by the aptly named.

Upset in 1919, and the only blot
on_Native Dancer’s record wa/s"a
1953 loss to Dark Star.

Secretariat has been defeated
a couple of times during a specta-
cular "two-year career, but his
most famous setback may have
come at the hands of the Mary-
land Racing Commission.

Following. two [hours of testi-
mony Tuesday. the five-member
commission blocked a move to
change the listed time for the

‘May 19 Preakness and give Sec-
.‘ retariatthe record. - '

After viewing videotape evi-.

dence presented by. the Colum-
bia Broadcasting System, the

" commission acknowledged that

Secretariat probably_ rang‘ faster
than Canonero II, who’set the

i Preakness record in 1971.

‘In a unanimous opinion. how-

‘ ever. the commission svaixdjit was

 

  
 

"bound by its rules and regula-
tions which provide’ that the of-

ficial time of any race is -that.

which is. clocked by_ the official
timer.“' ~ '  ‘

The Visumatic electronic timer

at Pimlico’ clocked Secretariat
for the 1-3/16 miles in 1:55.‘ but
twodays later. the stewards. low-
ered the official timeto the 1:54-
25 recorded ‘with a stopwatch

— by E. T. McLean. Jr.. Pimlico‘s
— officialtimer; »

But that didn’t satisfy what the
commission apparently regarded
as outside interests. -

Two clockers for the Daily Rac-
ing Form reported soon after the
Preakness that they had timed’
Secretariat in 1:53-2,-5. well be-

low Canoneros 1:54. V
Then. after Secretariat became 1

the first Triple Crown winner in
25 yearsby adding the Belmont
record to the one he already set
in the Kentucky Derby. many per-
sons clamored for a review of the
controversial Peakness time-.
‘Penny’ Tweedy, owner’ of the
Meadow Stable’ colt who has been

syndicated -for_a_ record $6,080,-

000, made a formal request after

The same tape and additional
evidence was presented at the
hearing by CBS. ,

Bill Creasly. executive produc-
er of the Sports Illustrated show
for CBS-TV. said therejwas no
‘attempt to establish an exact
time for Secretariat but merely
to prove that he ran faster than

Sandy Grossman of CBS‘ ex-
plained the technical aspects in-
volved, and contended that-Secre-
tariat had run fasterrby four-fifths

J. Newton Brewer. chairman

of the racing commission. said

there was noquarrel with the

CBS presentation but noted tfie

network _"has no official

Later.. in its statement. the
commission said: “It was ac-

posi-

knowfedged by several of thewit- -

nesses including those persons.

Movie Rundown

\

by M. C. PILECKI
What good is a scarecrow‘? Does
it really scare crows‘? Nah. it
makes them laugh. and don't

 bother a farmer that gives them a
A , few laughs.

Well. that's how Lion (Al Pa-
cinoi explains it to his new—found
Max

(Gene Hackman i. It's also a good
description of Lion. who seeks to
‘avoid trouble. -including respon-
sibility. by making people laugh.

A i just like a raggedy old scarecrow.

He forgets that the scarecrow is

— torn apartby wind. weather. and

even the crows. He has control
over none of it. and even his fun-
ny appearance. his only defense.
is of no use.

That's a fairly quick summa-

‘ tion of the Chatham Cinemas lat-

est offering. Scarecrow.

Max is a pugnacious ex-con on
his way to Pittsburgh (right) to

_open a car wash and fulfill a

dream.‘ For the nine years that he

 " ‘has been “asleep,” like a Rip Van

Winkle, in prison he has saved his
money and made detailed plans
While

tin, he meets up with Lion. He
makes him laugh and gives him
his last match, so Max feels he
"has found some one to trust.

Page 8—THE PITT NEWS—Thursday, July 12, 1973

The film concerns how Max
learns to become a "scarecrow."
how he can avoid his too-frequent
fights by making a few laughs
and how he finally. learns to trust
others. On the other hand. Lion
is returning to visit the wile he
deserted in pregnancy and to see
his five-_vear-old kid for the first
time. The responsibilit_v he avoid-
ed for so long finally takes hold of
him and crushes him.

Hackman gives a remarkable
performance showing the evolu-
tion of Max. He very ably portrays
a man groping to cope in a socie-
ty that has changed without him.
His Max is a nitty-gritty char-
acter with a long hidden streak of
warmth that invites audience in-
volvement. ‘

Although the character of Lion
is not defined as well, Pacino ex-
pertly handles what material he
has. To those who remember the
stern Michael Corleone of The
Godfather. Pacino’s brilliant
comic performances may come
as a surprise.

  

Director Jerry Schatzberg (who
directed Pacinos first film Panic
in Needle Parki has made a very

sensitive movie of the "'down-and- _

outers" of American society.
keeping it sympathetic to middle
class audiences without hokiness.
For authenticity. much of the
film. which was shot on loca-
tion. was photographed by hidden
cameras blending the two stars in
with the “real people“ of their

surroundings. For one scene in a _

Denver bar. local derelicts and
winos were enticed by free beer
and a days pay to be an "audi-
ence" for Max‘s striptease. re-
vealing a change in character as
well as other things.

A little more "unreal“ is Fran-
cois Truffaut's new movie Such a
Gorgeous Kid Like Me at the
Shadyside Theatre. Truffaut man-
ages to poke fun at comtempor-
ary “culture.‘v' especially popu-
lar music and film. in this irre-
verent piece. 1

give him a free ride. His train is

number one is not as cruel: he
doesn’t really want to , kill, it
seems, he just wants to wreak as

As a whole. the movie is boring
