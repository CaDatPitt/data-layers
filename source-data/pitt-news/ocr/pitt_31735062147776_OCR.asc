sate ' last Cwednesday it was --‘decided
that the Freshmen should resume
wearing theirécaps soon. Practically-
al1":the senCatCors favored the plan of
-issuing an porder-Cgthat the Freshmen
continue wearing their caps,» although.
several disagreed as to.-the means by
which this decision was to be en-
forced. Only one co-ed memberj de-
clared herself opposed. to making the
Freshmen -wear their little caps ‘dur-
ing the cold winter months.)

‘Owing to me‘-. fact that the Fresh-
men, Cinthe belief that such-was the
custom‘ at Pitt, had already Cdiscarded
theirj caps for the winter, several sen-
ators, hinted that it would be ,a diffi-
cult “matter. forjthe SophsC'to make
them Wear? theirCcapjsCagainC.C It was
suggested that the Senate give the
Sophomores two -weeks’.-time in "which
to enforce the decision, -and that‘ an
“open season” be deCclaredC if they can-

in the Senate were of the o_pinion~ that
this ultimatum to the Sophs -should
not be announced opé“n_ly: because the
Freshmen, knowing that the Sopho-
mores were under trial, would be
given anCCincen~tive to _ rebel, ? which
state for affairs wa-snot at all "unde-
sirable, according to some senators.-
The. Cmajority of the Senate were
stronglyj in favor of giving the an-
nouncement. to the Sophs full public-
ity: , 7' C ~‘ ‘ C C ~

Anothen.motion passed at this meet-

ing was that one *cheerlea~der in uni-

form be present at all -regular games,
of the University. The ‘investigation
of. the - proposed Freshman amend-
ment to hold a primary eletcion was
deferred to a_ committee. The discus-

Dr. George W. M-clsaren, Dent., ’19, _

of All-American backﬁeld fame, who
is _now Athletic Director  football,
track and -basket ball coach at the
University of Kansas, Fayetteville,
Ark, comes through with a newsy
letter, telling something of his re-
cent activities. He also sent acopy.
of the Arkansas Traveler, the offi-
cial paper of the University of Ar-
kansas, and one doesn’t have to read
very much in it without discovering
that they ﬁgure George is about the]
“whole works” at Fayetteville. The
paper contains a. ﬁne picture of
George, .with a. writeuip in which
they tell how much they like him,
not only as a coach but as a gen-
tleman and one with the right ideals
as regards college athletic activ-
itiest, .

The Arkansas team, coached by
McLaren, was rated. second in the
Southwestern -Clonference, Texas A.
»& M., the team which. handed an un-
expected defeat to Center College
in a post season game, being ranked
ﬁrst. I

McLaren has not decided whether
he will remain at Arkansas and
would consider a good position with

that he. could combine a coaching (po-
sition ,with a dental practice. He
says the prospects at Arkansas next
year are exceptionally bright as they
had a Freshman team of 60 candi-
dates with some good boys amon

them, at least ﬁve of. them looking
like sure regulars. ‘

- Dr. Vaux was endorsed by practic-
ally the entire medical profession of
the -County and’ recommended to the
mayor for appointment to the posi-
tion of Director of Department of
Public Health. The mayor, quick to
realize the importance of such a po-
sition and the" need of an experienced
Medical Officer, appointed Dr. Vaux
with, practically no opposition.

town, moved on January 1 to new
offices, 421-2-3 Park Building, the
very suite occupied some years ago
as athletic and alumni headquarters.
The Park B"ui1=d'in-g office is now the
center of activity for George Ketch-
um, '17, 'Carlton Ketchum, '16, Nor-
man _MacLeod, ’17, and  J.

William R. Hovis, ’16, and Warren
‘B. -Dygert, ’10, making a total of
seven Pitt graduates. Incidentally,
the ﬁrm has two other Pittites, Har-
ry Lessig, Ex., ’18, and Leroy Fleck,
an -undergraduate, temp-oirarily en-
gaged in some special activities un-
der their direction, and the legal,
medical, dental and other needs of
the‘ whole outﬁt are invariably cared
for by Pittitesz. -Some other, much
larger ﬁrms, may have more Pitt men
on its rolls, but none has a better
percentage-—you can’! beat 1002 per
cent. George Ketchum, who devotes
most of his energies to the work of
the Citizens.’ Committee on City
Plan, has just been made executive
secretary of that organization after
about three years’ service as public-
ity manager. ,

Pitt men know Carlton Ketchum
best through his! direction of the
two -big Alumni -Hall alplpealsi. Other
campaigns directed by the Ketchum
organization in the past" ‘couple of
years include the Western Pennsyl-
vania direction of the European Re-
lief, and the two Jewish Relief cama-
paigns, the second of which is now
on. and the political publicity for the
Leonard Wood League and’ the Her-

cally they have directed such suc-

TIA short time ago we (published on
the Alumni Page a picture of the
1900 varsity football team which won
honors for old W.‘ U. P. It was fur-
nisihed by Wilbur D. Hockehsmith,
’01, -and caused considerable com-
ment on the -part of the men who
followed athletics twenty years ago.
There were /two men on the picture
who could not be identiﬁed by Mr.
Hockensimith, but we have a letter
from our old friend, Dr. J. H, Cress-
rown, Dent., ‘Oil, 501 Wick Building,
Youngstown, Ohio, givingthe desired
information. Dr. Chessrown played
center on that team, and those who
know of his ability call Bob Peck a
second Chessrown.

The Alumni Secretary sent marked
copies of the paper with the pic-
turesu to all the old timers of the
team, and here is Dr. Chesasrown’-s re-
ply»: .

“I received the papers 0. K. This
is the picture that I don’t have,
1900 team. I would like to have a
copy of this picture, and if you will
give me the name and address of
the fellow who owns the—-original, I
will take the ‘matter up with him.

“The ‘unknown,’ the one in back
row, or standing, is Emil Fryer, who
graduated from Dental School in
1901., and he was. located on the
‘South Side, Pittsburgh. -He prac-
ticed only a fevvv; years‘ and the last
I knew of him -he was» traveling for
some jewelry -company. The other
‘unknown’ in second row is Jelly, al-
so a graduate of the Dental School
in 1902 or,190*3. ' Some one may have
told you about these fellows, but for
fear they have not, here it is.”

The secretary is arranging to get
a copy of the -picture for him through
Wilbur Hockensmith. If any other
members of the team vwould like it
copy they should advice the alumni
office, and we will arrange.

been named head coach of athletics

 

sity. It will be an all year around
position and Dehart will take charge.
there next fall, with the Opening of I
the football season. Newspaper dis-
patches say that the appointment of
Dehart was made after a committee
selected to select: a new ‘head coach
had looked over a. score or more of
cahdirlates.

Dehart was in the alumni office
last week, on returning from Lex-
ington, where he signed. his contract.
He says prospects as regards mater-
ial 'aren’t very bright at W. & L.,
but that they have a fine s~c:hoo1,~good
spirit and he -is conﬁdentthat he
can “deliver the goods” for them in
time. They have a very hard sched-
ule in football to start with, Vir-
ginia, West Virginia, Georgetown and
other strong teams being met. They
also have_ the one-year residence rule
in effect so that he cannot ﬁgure on

ATTIIAIITIVE PRIIERAM
, AT AIIJMNAE LUNIJIIEIIN

The promise on the card ‘announc-
ing the luncheon to be held at the
Chatham, Saturday, January 14: “We
are going to be prompt for we are
having a mighty ﬁne time. Mary
Aiken says so, and she knows, be;
cause she is the ehairman,” was ful-
ﬁlled on said date-. The chairman of
the program committee, Mary Aiken,
Col., ’19, who is also on the Wom-
en’s Year Committee, warned us
early that her policy was two-fold:
‘to start the luncheon on time, and
to introduce to us new people on
the program. ,Let it be said to her
-credit.‘ that she carried out her pro-
gram as planned.

Mary Thompson and Mollie David-
son represented the Law School and
did it so well that other depart-
ments had to admit it as one of the
“performing” schools of the Univer-
sity. Mary recited a favorite: “In
the Usual Way,” the sentiment and
humor of which were much appre-
ciated. For those who know the
Davidson’-s as a. musical family, only
mention of the name is enough to
tell him we enjoyed it when Mollie
played. To others, we say, you
should have been there. Quite a lo-
cal .touch was gi'Ven when Laura
Riley read several of Bill Allen's
poems. among them: “When Shady
Avenue Was Shady Lane,” and
“We.” William H. Allen has been
written up many times: in these col-
umns, so that those, who do not
know him» from the 1915 class, know
of him._ In fact the whole country
is getting to know pf him because of
his Writings since the war. So we
felt a special pride in hearingthese
particular poems read aloud, and to
Laura we should say that they lost
nothing in the reading, ,-but rather
gained.

- Edna Wigton, Col., '19, accompanied
by -Carmelita ‘Crowley of the same
class, delighted us with a vocal solo.
Dorothy Paulin, our «chairman, show-
ed us another‘ of her versatile ac-
complishments when we sang to pop-
ular tunes words she adapted to the
luncheon, among them one to the
tune of Ach Du Lieber Augustine,
with toasts to our chairman of the
day, Mary Aiken, our own -Dean
Amos, Alma Mater, those» -present and
specially to those absent, wishing
they were there. ‘

And last but not least was an un-
expected feature in a talk by Miss
Lucile Atcherson of Columbus, Ohio,
graduate of Smith College, and Ohio
State Univens.ity,_ for ﬁve years
executive secretary to Miss Anne
‘Morgan, in her relief for devastated

FRENCH ﬁﬂl’-ERNMENT

Louis Broido, 1917 graduate of the
Law School, who won unusual fame
at Pitt for his activities in the ﬁeld
of public speaking and" debate, has
just received word of his decoration
by the French government as a Chev-
alier of the Legion of Honor for his
service with the-United States Liqui-
dation Commission in France. Noti-

bon and medal of the order, through
the French Embassy at Washington.

this city and is the son of Morris
Broido of 15327 Beeler -street. Hewent
overseas with Base Hospital No. 27,
composed chieﬂy of Pitt graduates-
He served eight months with the hos-
pital units and was then commission-
ed a lieutenant in the quartermaster’s
corps. While with that branch of the
service he was assigned to duty with

_ the rents, requ.i‘s.itions and claims de-,

partment.» Serving in this capacity,
he assisted in the renting and adjust-
ing of claims of many large hotels
and other properties used during the
war as hospitals. Later he was pro-
moted a ﬁrst lieutenant.

After the signing of the armistice,
Broido was’ detailed to the‘, United
States liquidation committee at Paris,
and assisted in the settling of general
accounts between the French and
American governments. These total
millions of dollars. He was later sent:
to Italy to perform the ‘same service.
While it is not stated in the letters re-

for the work he .did while with the li-
quidation committee.

IAFAYETIE IIIINIIIIS
 “JIIIJII” WITII LETTER

Dr. J. B. (Jock) Sutherland, De-nt.,
’18, who has won fame as head
coach of the undefeated Lafayette
College football ‘team, has gained a
d-istinctio-n that has never "before
-come to ‘~a Pitt graduate. That is
to, be awarded varsity athletic insig-
nia from‘ two institutions. “Jock,”
as everyone knows, was a. king pin
in athletics at Pitt, winning his var-
sity letter in football in 1914, 1915,
1916 and ‘1917 in track in 1915, 1916,
1917 and" 1918 and wrestling in 1916.

Now, as a reward for turning out
the great team at Lafayette, he has
been awarded their varsity “L” -by
the college varsity “L” Club. This
is the second letter given “Jock” in
his three years at Lafaye-tte. It is
one of the few instances of a col-
lege star who ﬁnished at one school
and who was given such recognition
by another. No one knows how
“Joc-k"’ is going to -combine the “P”
and “L” on his sweater but that is
a problem for him to ﬁgure out.
Newspaper reports are not clear
as to whether “Jock” ‘has signed to
coach at Lafayette for another year
but it is: a pretty safe bet that he
has because the Easton authorities
have a high regard for his ability
and a’ Lafayette football team of
these days without “Old Jock” at
the helm would ‘be like ‘-Hamlet with-
out the ’ melanvohonly Dane. Right
now, “Jock” is a member of the
Pitt Dental faculty. '

 

the effect that those present at the
luncheon ~considen*ed the diplomatic
-service should -be opened to. women,
and that if Miss At-cherson qualiﬁed
in the civil service examination, she
should «be given a proper appoint-
ment.
