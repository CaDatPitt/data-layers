The Pitt Men’s Study was
awarded a $10.3 million grant to
study the natural history of HIV
infection in homosexual men.
The National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases and the
National Cancer Institute gave
Pitt the grant.

According to Dr. Charles
Rinaldo, principal investigator of
the study, the grant is being used
to research rates of infection
among gay men, the largest HIV
risk group. “We are studying why
some homosexual men get

anal sex.

Scientific discoveries prove that
gay men who engage in anal-
receptive intercourse are at a
greater risk of acquiring the HIV
infection, Rinaldo said.

These and other studies are
important to research because

some gay men may be infected -

while not at high risk for the
disease, he said. i

The grant allows for the

Rapper KRS—One decries.Amerz'ca’s ‘barbaric society.’

By Brian Berger

and Rob Pugliese
T be Pitt News

Flawed education, a corrupt religious

' system and a lack of common sense have

led to a “barbaric society,” according to
KRS—One, rap singer and founder of the
Stop The Violence movement.

KRS—One, whose real name is Kris Parker,
is the leader of the rap group Boogie
Down Productions. He lectured Thursday
evening at Duquesne University onhis
new project, Human Education Against
Lies. During the lecture, entitled “HEAL

yourself,” KRS—One spoke about
“huma-ncentricity” and “CSDS,” or
common—sense deficiency syndrome, to a
crowd of about 500 people.

KRS—One, which stands for “knowledge
reigns supreme over everyone,” said the
HEAL movement is about building self
and healing the consciousness of the
masses. CSDS is “the first disease that is
killing humanity, and correct education is
the best medicine,” he said.

According to KRS—One, flawed education

teaches people to memorize rather than to
think.
“Intellect is not memory,” he said. “You

are getting your degrees in memory, not

intellect. No one is an intellectual in this
educational system. We all know
Christopher Columbus did not discover
America, but in order to pass history you’ll
write that Christopher Columbus
discovered America, and you’ll pass history
because of this lie.” .

When KRS—One was brought to Pitt by
the Black Action Society in April 1990, he
spoke from an Afrocentric point of view.
This time he lectured from a “humancentric”
stance. i

‘‘I’m not pro—black, ‘cause that’s stupidity.
I’m not pro—white, ‘cause that’s stupidity.

I’m pro—human. Before you are a race,
religion or an occupation, you are a human
being,” he said.

He called forchange and revolution in
education. “When you ask the wrong
question, no matter how logical the answer
is, its still wrong,” he said. “We have black
scholars asking the wrong questions: Who’s
the first man? Who’s closer to God? Who’s
closer to the devil? This is stupidity.”

Discussing the Bible, KRS—One said “If
you don’t know the history of the author
you’re reading, you don’t know the book.
You’re reading in blind faith.”

Gospel Ni ghtsymbolic of AfI‘ican-American struggle

By Christine Hanna
Staff Writer I

Gospel Jubilee kicked off
Black Week 1991 last night as a
symbol of the beginning of the
black struggle, according to
Black Action Society member
Steve Pipkin.

“I think a lot of people are

very excited starting off lBlack,

Week] with a religious event.
It’s where black people found
their strength. It’s a good place
to start,” Pipkin said.

Pitt’s gospel choir, Some of
God’s Children, and special
guest, the Howard University
Gospel Choir, performed to a
packed William Pitt Union
Ballroom.

“Programs like this merge the
community and student body
together. It’s really pleasant ——
a real togetherness. I wish we

had more of these events

throughout the semester,” said

Clinton Robinson, a member of I

the BAS‘ community—outreach
committee. , H A

BAS chairpersonMarta Effinger
said Gospel Night ‘always starts
Black Week “because the
community and students join
together. It’s a good time for us
to look back on our heritage.”

The Howard Gospel Choir has
performed at the White House,
the prime minister’s estate in
Barbados, the Kennedy Center
and the Smithsonian Institution.
The Howard choir has also
earned first—place honors at the
Black Caucus of Music Educators’
National Conference and
performed with Stevie Wonder
and Patti LaBelle.

Pittsburgh residentjustin Finch
said he always wanted to hear
Howard sing, and Gospel Night
also gives him the opportunity
to hear music from different
areas.

After Howard performed,

coordinator Brian‘ Bolton said,
“Howard was very inspirational.
It moves you deep inside.”
Slippery Rock Gospel Choir
of Slippery Rock University,
Bethany Baptist Gospel Choir

andRESOUN D of Pittsburgh and -
the mime group Hands in Praise»

were the other organizations
present.

BAS programming chair-
person T iwanda Taylor said the
program was spiritually uplifting
for students and the community.
She “couldn’t even put into
words” how the Howard
Choir had affected the
audience.

Student Government Board
President-elect Gil Golden
attended Gospel Night and said
Effinger had suggested that he
attend Black Week events.
Golden reaffirmed his support
for the proposed black cultural
center.

Storyteller tradition ins pir

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

Author Paule Marshall credited
her success as a writer to a rich
tradition of women storytellers,
“the poets in the kitchen.”

“They were

aware of it, they were teaching
me to write,” she said.

Her lecture Saturday was
sponsored by Pitt’s black studies
department and the Kitabu Kilabu
and Sojourner’s Truth reading
clubs.

She advised aspiring writers to

“write it down. And even if they r

can’t bring themselves to write it
down, tell it to someone.”

Marshall said her experience
as a feature writer and researcher
for Ebony helped her gain
discipline. ‘‘I couldn’t sit around
and wait for inspiration. I had to
turn out copy every day,” she
said. '

She discussed the techniques
she used to complete her four
novels. “Once I've finished a
book, I’ve spent so ‘much time
with it, so much blood, sweat and
tears, I'm ready for the next thing
to come along.”

She also said one of the benefits
of being middle—aged was
“accepting yourself as you are.”

Marshall has received the John
Dos Passos award and the
American Book Award but “One

 Panthers capture elusive sixth victory

By Ryan Buncher
staff Writer

The Pitt football team that won
its first ﬁve games showed up
again, as the Panthers beat Rutgers
22-17 Saturday.

“I remember standing up here
after we beat Maryland. Everyone
would have thought that very
quickly we would get. [win]

Paul Hackett. “We h_ad some
‘tough battles along the way. You
have no idea out there how good
it feels for this group of men to
get number six. [A winning record]
was our goal from day one.”
Pitt seemed ready to take it
early on, as they moved the ball
to the Rutgers 52 with strong
running by Jermaine Williams.
The drive ended on a third-down
run by Curtis Martin, when he
was rudely greeted in the

his first play back after the toe
injury he suffered against Notre
Dame. » '

The Panthers were able to ﬁnish
the job on the next possession.

the right side for a 58-yard
touchdown..

Volleyball keeps Big East regular-season crown

By Ryan Buncher
Slaﬂ" Writer

Villanova was supposed to give Pitt a
serious challenge for supremacy in Big
East volleyball this season. Both teams
entered yesterday's battle for the regular-
season title with perfect 6-() records in the
conference, but the defending champion
Panthers were 20-6, while the Wildcats
were 27-2.

“'I'hey were tied with us in the Big East
for first place, so we wanted to get started
and show them who’s really number
one,” said senior co-captain I)ee MacAulay.

The Panthers wasted no time doing
that, winning 11 straight points before
even allowing a side out on the serve of
senior outside hitter Shelly Seanor, who
had three service aces in the match. Pitt

ran it to 14-0 before giving up a point and
won the game 15-1.

“They looked like they were so afraid to
play in the very beginning,” said head
coach Sue Woodstra. “I know they’re a lot
better team than [for] us to be able to beat
them 15-1.”

Villanova head coach David Barkley

tried to encourage his team by saying it
was just one bad game, but the next two
were not much better for the visiting
Wildcats. Pitt trailed early in the second
game, 1-4, before taking control of the
match with 10 straight points. Pitt eventually
went on to win 15-8.

Game three was more of the same. The
Panthers trailed 1-5, then rolled off nine in
a row, eventually winning 15-8. The point
that tied it at 5-5 was a booming shot down
the middle by outside hitter Ann Marie

Lucanie.

Lucanie had a match-high 12 kills to go
along with eight digs and a .545 hitting
percentage. MacAulay had the match high
in digs, with nine, and had five kills and a
.855 percentage. The other co—captain,
Sue Zonneville, had eight kills and a .667
percentage. T wo-time conference player
of the week, junior Pam Clifford, led the
Wildcats with eight kills, a .458 percentage
and four digs.

The Panthers had an outstanding
percentage of .553, compared to .159 for
Villanova. Pitt also had a wide margin in
digs, 45 to 18.

“We played really smooth," MacAulay
said. “Our serving was definitely on, which
is a big help. Shelly served a great game
[Game 1].”

The victory gave the Panthers‘ their

second straight regular-season Big East
championship. This is only the second
year that the conference has had a full
round-robin schedule in the regular season.
Pitt will go for their second straight
postseason title Nov. 25 and 24 at Fitzgerald
Field House.

The Panthers do have some business
beforethen. West Virginia University comes
to the Field House tomorrow night, and
Pitt will be in the Florida State Tournament
this weekend. Temple and Alabama-
Birmingham are the other two teams in
that tournament.

Tuesday’s match will be the second

_ meeting of,the season with West Virginia.

In the earlier meeting at Morgantown,
W.Va., the Mountaineers won the first
game 15-8 before Pitt came back to take
the next three 15-11,'15-5, 15-10.

‘Magic’ not gone for fans of Earvin Johnson

When the news about Magic
Johnson testing positive for the
HIV virus hit the newsroom last
Thursday afternoon, I
experienced the same reaction
that many others did when they
first heard: disbelief.

There was no way a person as
popular and as powerful as Magic,
someone who made everyone
else around him better, whether
on the court or off, could have
something so terrible happen to
him.

As I ran to check the Associated
Press wire, I was shaking. I just
could not believe what I had
heard until I saw something to
verify it. I thought that this was
just some kind of cruel hoax,
someone’s idea of a tasteless joke.

I--Iowever as I glanced over the
sheets spewing weather reports
and rattling off other seemingly
trivial information, my eyes finally
hit what I had hoped I would not
find. I'll never forget the words
on the title of the newsbrief —
“Magic Johnson AIDS.”

The way I felt at that moment
cannot be described in words. I
could not speak or even move. I
was just stunned. It was like
losing someone you loved. It was
like Magic had died. While I
never knew Iiarvin “Magic”
Johnson personally and never
even saw him play in person, I
felt like I had just received news
that an old friend had been taken
away.

I remembered back to the

summer between sixth and
seventh grade. I was 11, and it
was my first real exposure to the
NBA Finals. I liked the Celtics at
that point mainly because that’s
who my dad pulled for. The Celtics
were playing the Lakers for the
championship that year. While

Rob Mazur

Magic was playing for Los
Angeles, I remember noticing the
way he led the team, how
everyone seemed to do what he
told them. Even a player with
almost twice the experience in
the league like Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar went where he told them
because they knew that the ball
would be where it was supposed

to be. That was impressive. While
Boston tried to stop him with
occasional success, they still
respected him. .

That’s what I gained for Magic,
too. Many called me a
“bandwagon fan” for jumping to
the Lakers’ side after the Lakers
took the title that year. But I
wasn’t just pulling for the Lakers;
I was pulling for Magic.

As the years progressed the
Lakers won two more titles under
their “Showtime” offense, led by
Magic. The fast-tempo game they
played was both a crowd pleaser
and an effective tool against
slower opponents. The Lakers
became the first team to win
back-to-back titles since the 1969
Celtics. However as respect for

the Lakers grew, so did my respect
for Magic. I began to realize he
was more than just an on-court
celebrity. He was an off-court
giant as well. I '

Magic did more than worry
about basketball games; he
worried about others. He and
McDonald’s co-sponsored a
charity basketball game to raise
millions for the United Negro
College Fund. He worked with
kids from theginner cities, like
those from his own hometown of
Lansing, Michigan.

The years began to catch up
with Magic, though. Showtime
began to slow down, though the
Lakers kept winning. Magic still

Magic’s contraction of HIV
brings heightened public
awareness to a deadlier opponent
than any basketball team. People
now realize that even if they are

heterosexuals, they are not
beyond the possibility of being
infected with HIV.

Even though Magic’s playing
career is over, his life is not. Now
he moves on to a different role.
As Johnson himself said,
“[Basketball] was a big part of my
life, but my wife is healthy and
my life goes on. I plan on living
for a long time, and I guess now
I can enjoy some of the other side
of living.”

Continued from page 4
attempts after long kickoff returns
on the next two drives, with
Rutgers making theirs, a 24-yarder
by John Benestad, and Pitt kicker
Scott Kaplan missing from 31
yards out.

A 19-yard punt return by
Marshall Roberts set up Rutgers
in Pitt’s territory early in the
second quarter. Scarlet Knight
quarterback T om T arver hit Jim
Guarantano for 12 yards to the
Pitt one on third down, one of
only three third downs Rutgers
converted all day. Tarver went in
on a quarterback sneak two plays
later to give Rutgers a 10-7 lead.

DietrichJells helped Pitt answer
with a 20-yard reception and a

12-yard run on a reverse to help A

‘set up a 38-yard field goal by
Kaplan. The Panthers then took
the lead on their next possession.
Van Pelt ran it in from the Rutgers
five for a 17-10 lead.

The offense kept going in the
second half, taking the kickoff
and going 77 yards to Rutgers’
three-yard line before settling for
a 20-yard field goal by Kaplan.
Jells and tight end Rob Coons
each had 20-yard receptions on
the drive.

The lead stayed at 20-10 until ‘

the fourth quarter. Pitt punter

Leon Theodorou had his punt
blocked by Rutgers running back
Chris Behnke. The defense shut
the Scarlet Knights down for three
plays, including two sacks.
Rutgers ran a fake field goal on
fourth down, and holder
Guarantano found backup tight
end Tim Pernetti for a 21-yard
touchdown to bring Rutgers
within three. _

Something that hurt Pitt in two
of its losses, against Syracuse and
East Carolina, was running the
clock out late in the game. They
got the ball at their own 31-yard
line with 5:15 left. The ensuing
drive went 12 plays down to
Rutgers’ six, ending on a fourth-
down, pass-run option play. More
importantly, it took 4:48 off the
clock, leaving the Scarlet Knights
only 28 seconds for a last—gasp
drive. Martin ran the ball six times
for 39 yards on the drive.

“I thought Curtis did a greatjob
with his body late in the fourth
quarter,” Hackett said. “I think
that was the key.”

The offense didn’t seem to need
much work on moving the ball
up and down the field. The
running game was effective at
times even before the last drive.
Williams carried the load in the
first half with nine carries for 38

yards. His only carry in the second
half went for no gain. Conversely
Martin struggled in the first half,
gaining only 10 yards on seven
carries, but came on with 16
carries for 85 yards in the second
half.

The passing game was there all
day. Van Pelt completed 21 of 34
passes for 335 yards, one
touchdown and one interception.
Moore caught five passes for 91
yards, including the 38-yard
touchdown.

His season-reception total is
now 48, a new Pitt record for
tight ends.

The Pitt News

Do you watch “Hee-Haw?” Is
the Nashville network your cup
of tea? Is leather, long-hair, snuff
and tight denims your decor on a
night out’ Then the United States
Hot Rod Association Camel Mud
and Monster Truck Racing Series
event this past weekend was not
for you. Over 10,000 people in
the two nights felt the power and
excitement of the events once
called “mud bogging.”

The event returned to the
Pittsburgh Civic Arena for a two-
night show featuring the huge,
popular monster trucks and the
up—and—coming mud racers.

The four fastest times from the
first round of mud racers advance
to the Camel Shootout. The four
fastest drivers then make one
more run through the pit with the
fastest of the four being declared
the winner. Drivers often

_ complete the course in less than

two seconds with winners
determined by thousandths of a
second. 9

"Super Trooper" outdistanced
the rest of the mud racing field,
finishing with a time of 1.831
seconds for his record /18th win
on the mud—racing circuit, the
most by any driver ever. “Mud
Patrol” finished second with a
time of 1.903 seconds. “Let’s
Boogie” came in third with a time
of 1.907, followed by “Ground
Zero” at 2.019.

The objective for the crowd-,  9

clear the row of seven crunch
cars in the fastest time. The six
competitors were
Outlaw,” ; “Equalizer,” ; last year's
champion “Bearfoot,”; “Grave
Digger,”; current points leader
“Taurus,” and the ever—popular,
original monster truck, by which
all other monster trucks are
judged, “Bigfoot."

After the four fastest times were
decided, the trucks were ready
for head—to-head competition.

Taurus, who recorded the fastest '

time, went against Grave Digger,

and Bearfoot and Bigfoot were ,

matched up.

In the first race Taurus grabbed
a faster start and blew away Grave
Digger. What hurt Grave Digger
most was it got too high off the
ground (approximately 25 feet),
and by the time it landed, Taurus
had crossed the finish line. In the
second... race both Bigfoot and
Bearfoot got great starts and
finished at the same time in a
dead heat, forcing both trucks to
race again. After Bigfoot refueled,
it blew away Bearfoot in the
sudden—death race.

In the final race Taurus and
Bigfoot lined up in a classic Ford-
versus-Chevy matchup. With the
crowd on the edge of their seats,
the trucks exploded for the start
position and finished in what
looked like another dead heat.
After a few seconds pause, Taurus
was crowned champion of the
event.

clinic is like a doctor's office. The
men voluntarily comein every
six months for a physical and to
answer questions, and some join
in a psychological assessment."

Although the HIV infection can
damage the brain, Rinaldo said
tests have shown men who are
HIV-positive are psychologically
normal compared to men who
are not infected. “The brain is not
damaged until someone is in the
full-blown stages of the AIDS
disease,” he said.

The second area of study is the
lab, where blood is sampled every
six months to check for infection.
“If any of the men in our study
develop AIDS, we see how their
immune systems are holding up,”
he said.

According to Rinaldo,
researchers are able to check on
the immu ne system by monitoring
T-cell levels in the blood.

“These cells are destroyed by
the virus, and if T-cell levels
continue to drop off, the immune

system becomes weak,” he said.
The final area of the study is the

data—management system, where
all the research information is
organized and analyzed.

The Pitt Men’s Study joins other
university research groups to form
the Multicenter AIDS Cohort
Study, the longest continuous
study of gay and bisexual men in
scientific history.

The four—year grant is a
continuation of the Pitt Men’s
Study, which began in 1983 to
study the natural history of HIV
infection in gay and bisexual men.

“AIDS researching changes
daily,” Rinaldo said. “The effects
of drug treatments change the
natural history. We hope for a
vaccination or drugs to slow the
disease down.” Vaccine trials may
be conducted in the future, he
added.

“One of the major successes of
the grant is that we have been
able to work closely with the at-
risk community, who have been
very cooperative,” Rinaldo said.
“Without the support of the
government and the gay
community, we couldn’t have
done the study.”

Continued from page 1 .

Faith should come from within, he said, “If you want to talk
to God, go to a quiet room, meditate on self, meditate on God,
meditate on life.”

The evils of technology was another focus of KRS—One’s
lecture. “Many of our idiotic scholars are running around
saying we’re civilized because of the tools we create. This is
stupid. Technological barbarians create new and better ways
to kill. The barbarian’s concept is to kill and take, not study,
debate and argue points.”

Another problem is the inability to relate to the right enemy,
he said. “We always root for the wrong people due to lack of
education.”

KRS-One used the example of the war in the Persian Gulf.
“You got black people leading black people to kill other black
people for white people. This is crazy.”

He summed up the economic system of America: “Capitalism.
Pimps and hoes,” he said. “You’re either sellin’ or bein’ sold;
take your pick.. Under the capitalist system, all men and
women are slaves. This government is not racist. This
government is greedy and miseducated. It's about money; it
ain’t about nobody’s color.” «

In 1988 he pioneered the Stop The Violence movement,
which was aimed at eliminating violence as well as educating
people about the staggering number of black-on—b1ack violent
crimes. ' 

His most recent project, HEAL, has just released an LP,
Civilization 225. Technology designed to unite all humanity
against the lies that permeate our society, he said.

Each March they are sent home.

“Because it is an agricultural
community and there are lots of
immigrants, sooner or later, with
enough risky behavior, [AIDS]
will ﬂourish,” Ellerbrock said. The
virus came to West Palm Beach in
the early ’70s and spread rapidly.

But since 1986, Jamaicans
entering the area have been
screened for AIDS, and less than
10 per year have the disease and
are not permitted to work.

The preliminary study done by
CDC revealed that many West
Palm "Beach County residents
knew the three major modes of
AIDS transmittal.

But “it is “one thing to know
how the disease is spread and
quite another to think you need
to take precaution," she said.

The study of the West Palm
Beach area will continue, but no
clear evidence about how the
disease is spread is available.
After asking the audience for its
suggestions, Ellerbrock said, “No
idea is too outlandish.”
