Callers make threats

against Farrakhan, Pitt

By Dan Bates
News Editor

Angry phone callers are reportedly
making violent threats in response to
Nation of Islam leader Rev. Louis Far-
rakhan’s planned visit to Pitt on
Nov. 14.

According to Student Activities
Director Andrew Smith, several
anonymous phone callers have “al-
luded to the fact that there may be
violence” when Farrakhan does speak
at Pitt.

Smith said the administration has
received at least four or ﬁve calls each
day concerning the plarmed visit.
However, most callers are merely
seeking information or expressing con-
cern about Farrakhan and his visit to
Pitt, Smith said.

“When I explain to them [phone
callers] the particulars and we talk
about the freedom of speech issue in
the U.S. Constitution, they under-
stand,” Smith said. “They still wish
to express concern about it, but they
are acting as intelligent pwple. should.
There are no problems with those
phone calls.”

The more problematic phone callers,

Smith explained, are the ones who do
not ,want to express their concems, but
instead threaten to harm either Far-
rakhan or a building on campus.
However, Smith said he sees no in-
herent dangers from the threats. These
threatening callers are merely “trying
to make us afraid.”

Smith said he was disturbed that
there are a number of people in the
community who are ‘ ‘willing to throw
away freedom of speech just because
they don’t like what one person has to

“say.” He  that after we limit

freedom of speech once, we set a’
precedent. “Who will then make the
decision of what might be dangerous
for us to hear?” added Smith.
Students are not going to be unduly

swayed anyway, Smith said. ‘_‘That’s ‘

what an education is for. You are here
to hear different types of ideas,” he
said. »

Admittedly, the ‘mounting pressure
stemming from Farrakhan’s, visit is
stronger than any previous complaints
about speakers in the last 18 years,
Smith said. However, he said he would
certainly defend the right of the Black

Action Society _to ask Farrakhan to. ‘

speak at Pitt.

World Food speakers
stress domestic hunger

By Jack Burkman
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh yester-
day held a day-long series of lectures,
panel discussions and ﬁlms at Forbes
Quad in an effort to draw attention to
the problems of hunger at both a
domestic and an international level.

The proceedings, which included a
live teleconference from Washington,
commemorated the sixth anniversary of
World Hunger Day.

Pitt is one of 190 colleges and
universities nationwide which ad-
dressed the hunger issue. The univer-
sity, according to Chief Program Coor-
dinator Cynthia Vanda, has a profes-
sional as well as a humanitarian interest
in this problem.

Said Vanda, “Many students and
professors are involved. Exchange
students from Third-World countries
often come here to acquire badly need-
ed agricultural skills.” '

The program’s purpose was to make
individuals aware of the magnitude of

. the hunger problem, at home and
abroad. Brigid Lund, coordinator of the
slide presentations, pointed out that “if
the major newspapers were to publicize
the hunger situation as they did other
issues, daily headlines would report a
minimum of 35,000 dea 

Lund also said that the American
media, even when it does draw atten-
tion to the problem, most often brings
into the limelight the phenomenon of
famine, which, though highly
dramatic, accounts for scarcely better
than 10 percent of all hunger-related
fatalities.

The second phase of Lund’s program

_ pertained to domestic hunger problems.

According to Vanda more than 100,000
persons right here in Allegheny County

suffer from acute hunger, which is the
temporary lack of food. And studies,
as Lund pointed out, “have revealed
that area doctors are seeing increasing
numbers of people who suffer from
malnutrition.” Intensifying the pro-
blem, implied the National Anti-
Hunger Coalition’s “Special Report on
Hunger,” have been cuts in social
spending by the federal government.

Though domestic problems were
stressed, the majority of yesterday’s
proceedings centered heavily upon the
causes of hunger in underdeveloped na-
tions. According to Vanda, the causes
of hunger and famine are of a social,
economic and political nature. Striking-

p ly, Vanda attributes a considerable

amount of hunger to sexism. The pro-
gram coordinator and former peace
corps member alleged that Third-
World societies have offered most of
what little technical education they have
to men.

“Women, however,” Vanda said,
‘ ‘handle most of a family’s nutritional

. dealings. The survival of the family is

very much’ dependent upon females. I
believe the entrance of women into the
mainstream of societies in Third-World
nations would help the situation.’ ’

As noted in part by the midday panel '

discussions, part of the hunger problem
is also economic. According to Van-
da, who spent six years in Africa, the
vast majority of ﬁnancial resources of
underdeveloped nations have been
devoted primarily to high-level
modernization.

Loans and gifts from the West have
been used to construct extensive
transportation systems and the like.
Both Vanda and several panelists,

however, made plain that 'I'l1ird-World

BAS plans

By Michael Adebimpe
For The Pitt News

All is_ now set for the upcoming
Black Week at Pitt.

According to a statement from the
ofﬁce of Hudson Prirnus, the chairman

. of the Black Action Society (BAS),

many activities have been plarmed to
mark the “golden” celebration of
Black Week. Black Week begins the

’ ﬁrst week of November.

The activities include a general
review of black history and culture, a

and several of the football players will
be on hand to cheer on the participants.
Every person donating‘ blood,

. whether student, faculty, staff or

average man off the street, can cast a
vote for the Pitt team. Also, every Pitt
student who donates blood will be eligi-
ble to win a pair of Pittsburgh Penguin
or Pittsburgh Spirit tickets. The names
of the students will be entered into a
rafﬂe and 50 students will receive two
tickets during the drawing.

The blood drive challenge is a na-
tional event which began nearly ﬁve
years ago at a Michigan-Ohio State
football ‘game; The Pitt-Penn State
competition is tied at one each. In
1983, Pitt donated 4,914 pints of blood
and Penn State donated 4,499 pints.
Last year, Penn State donated less pints
than the previous year but still manag-

spokesman in Belgrade said Palestinian
leader Mohammed Abbas holds
diplomatic immunity.

In the investigation of the Achille
Lauro incident, the preliminary autopsy
of American Leon ' er was
completed in Rome yesterday. The
autopsy confirmed the captive
passenger received bullet wounds in the
head and chest. Klinghoffer’s left leg
was mutilated and his right forearm
was torn off, possibly by ﬁsh, after his
body was thrown off the ship.

Another casualty of the hijacking in-
cident is the 26-month-old coalition
government of Italy, under Prime
Minister Bettino Craxi. Craxi offered
to resign and to dissolve the govern-

ment because of charges of his '

mishandling the Achille Lauro

Unisex insurance

(HARRISBURG) — More testimony

over unisex insurance rates in Penn-

hills which would allow insmance com- '

panics to continue using gender as a
basis for setting rates. Critics of the
legislation said its language is so broad
that it would also encourage insurance
companies to use other factors such as
race and religion in determining rates.

tunnel shutdown

(Pl'I'I‘SBURGH) — State police said
they will cite an Arkansas truck driver
for driving too fast for conditions
resulting from yesterday morning’s ﬁre
in the inbound lane of the Fort Pitt
Tunnel.

The ﬁre occurred shortly before 7
a.m. when a tractor trailer driven by
Keith Glassbum of Clinton, Ark.,
struck several cars and then plowed in-
to the rear of an automobile in the tun-
nel. The car’s gasoline tank ruptured
and exploded, setting off an intense
ﬁre. .

The driver of the car, 59-year-old
James Frazer of Scott Township, and
Glassburn and his wife, Rebecca,
evacuated their vehicles without injury.
State police said only one person was

. injured.

Margaret Brown of McDonald, the
operator of one of the cars involvedin
the accident, was treated for minor m-
juries at Mercy Hospital and released.

Both the inbound and outbound lanes
of the tunnel were closed. However,
the outbound lane was reopened about
noon, and the inbound lanes were re-
opened around 4:30 p.m.

Visiting prof urges better

By John Burkman
For The Pitt News

The study of international affairs is
rapidly becoming a necessary compo-
nent of a well-rounded undergraduate
education. That is the view, at least,
of Dr. Linda Fruzzetti, a recent guest
lecturer at Pitt.

During the course of six days,
Fruzzetti addressed the departments of
Religious Studies, Anthropology, and
Asian Studies and the Graduate School

'1 of Publicand International Affairs.

.
.‘\'

Fruzzetti, a native of Sudan, is a
North African agricultural expert, a
renowned researcher of women’s
studies in India and a savant in the area
of Mideastern politics and
socioeconomic systems — all of this in
addition to being a professor of social
anthropology at Brown University.
Fruzzetti is also a member of the
University Field Staff International,
which is a consortium of faculty
members who deliver speeches on in-
ternational topics at various institutions
» of higher learning. —
Fruzzetti said she feels the complex-

Black Week

continued from page 1
Week is not only for black students.
“We carmot refuse any white or any
other ethnic group from participating
in Black Week,” _he said. “If they want
to come in, they are welcome to.”

Rashid T. Soundiata, chairman and -

\ active member of the political action
committee for BAS, also agreed that
‘ ‘the BAS will not refuse any non-black
student from participating in the Black
Week activities.”

‘ ‘We intend to make sure that black

ity of the present world situation should
encourage universities .‘ ‘to emphasize
foreign cultures and international af-
fairs.” While she was very impressed
with Pitt’s departments in both of these
areas, she urged university leaders to
continue upgrading their programs.

According to Fruzzetti, recent world
developments evince the importance of
breeding a generation in tune with in-
ternational affairs. For example, she
said she feels the undergraduates of to-
day must be equipped to deal with a
Middle East that is likely to become
progressively more complex and
violent.

‘ ‘Incessant terrorist activity , ’ ’
Fmzzetti said, “has disturbed the
semblance of order in the Mideast to
the point where it is now all the more
difﬁcult to discuss the situation.”

Middle Eastern affairs,_however, are

not likely to be the only area of con-
cern for future generations. Today’s
students, Fruzzetti said, must also be
familiar with the political and an-
thropological systems of northeast
Africa, because this barren region is
likely to be the site of continued food
shortages and economic unrest.
Famine, she said, must be prevented
for both political and humanitarian
reasons. Constant famine could lead
“to the destabilization of the region”
and subsequently lead to a number of
problems for the West. She did applaud
the recent efforts of the United States
to relieve the famine-stricken nations.
Fruzzetti strongly urged world
leaders to band together as '. sot: of
“global community” in combating
problems. She said she ‘perceived in-
ternational unity to  a major step to
establishing a better, peaceful world.

students get their fair share of resources
on this campus, and make the at-

‘mosphere more comfortable for

them,” said Soundiata. “If in the midst
of all of that, other non-black students
want to be part of it, we’ll be glad to
let them in.”

Both Prirnus and Soundiata said they

believe that this year has been a suc- -

cessful year for BAS. Soundiata said,
“Our greatest achievement is simply

longevity, we are just as strong now as ’

ever." He continued, “We are spon-
soring ﬁve candidates for the Student
Government Board elections this year,
as opposed to one or two in the past.”

Soundiata also pointed out, “The re-
cent protest against apartheid in South
Africa is another major achievement of
the BAS. ’ ’
p ‘ ‘We want our voice to be heard and
our presence to be felt in this campus
and we are achieving just exactly that, ’ ’
added Soundiata.

Criminal Act ‘

The international arena is, by nature, anarchistic.
Lawlessness and violence are, unfortunately, a fact of life.
In an attempt to remedy this situation and impose order over
chaos, world leaders have, in‘ the past, worked to establish
a variety of international organizations which have been en-

trusted to establish and enforce international law. Signiﬁcant- ‘

ly, these organizations’ give states a legal authority to which
they can appeal in seeking peaceful solutions to international
disputes. In other words, they offer states an alternative to
violence. .

While often weak — if not impotent (the means to punish
at the disposal of these organizations are liinited, and fur-
ther, sovereign states are  to submit to any authority
other than their own) — these organizations have made many

I important inroads. The World Court, for instance, was in-

strumental in assisting the United States to peacefully resolve
the Iranian hostage crisis. By ruling against Iran, the World
Court enabled the United States to garner worldwide sup-
port for the imposition of economic sanctions. '

Since the time of its creation during President Harry
Truman’s term of ofﬁce, the United States has" been a
dedicated participant of the World Court. The United States
has admirably striven to lend credence to the World Court

by setting a law-abiding example for the rest of the world.

But that's all in the past.

Recently, President Reagan chose to withdraw the United
States from the compulsory jurisdiction of the World Court.
This impetuous action comes in anticipation of the Court’s
imminent negative ruling on the United States’ blatantly il-
legal mining of Nicaragua’s harbors.

The president seems to believe that he and the United States
are above reproach. Apparently, to his thinking, anything

i A is legal inthe name ofdemocracy, and any crime is forgivable

so long as it helps to halt the spread of communism. The
president’s action makes it clear that he refuses to subject
the United States to any precepts of international law that
fail to recognize this principle.

What are the implications of the president’s withdrawal
for the United States? By turning our backs on democratic
values and traditions, we are undermining our position as
spokesmen for morality in the world. Also, we are under-
mining what progress has been made in establishing prin-
ciples for international law and encouraging lawlessness.

On the positive side I can think of nothing. Can you?

On behalf of all the College of Arts

the Student Government Board and
‘more speciﬁcally, President Luke
Kluchko, for an inspired effort in reac-
quiring the accreditation of AFROTC
junior and senior courses. .

Up until April of 1985, a CAS stu-

dent taking AFROTC courses did not ,

receive credit toward a degree. In ef-
fect, inorderto graduate on time, CAS

‘students would have to take extra

classes in order to compensate for lost
AFROTC credits. _

In 1968, the war in Vietnam caused
a lot of anger in our homeland. In the
same year, a majority of the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences . decided to
withdraw accreditation for AFROTC
courses possibly over some emotional,
non-academic issues. No matter what
their reasons were for their actions, I
wish to thank the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences for allowing our case to be
reheard. But special thanks goes to the
Student Government Board and Presi-
dent Kluchko who spoke at an FAS

of his ﬁnal examinations.

Selectivity

Once again the Pitt Chaplains
Association has publicly expressed its
highly selective indignation over social
injustice in the world. Notwithstanding
the historical accuracy of the Rev.
Robert G. White’s Oct. 9 rnissive on
South African apartheid, the statement
is alarming for what it seems to omit.

  Letters to the Editor

Do my religious colleagues seek, for
example, “to provide freedom and
justice for all South African people of
color’ ’ alone or for all South Africans
irrespective of race? By describing the
‘ ‘white-controlled government’ ’ of the
Republic of South Africa as “demonic
and evil,” do the Rev. White and the
Pitt chaplains preclude any liberal
“compassion” for those currently in
power? ‘

In any event, the moral impact of the
chaplains’ indignation is surely
mitigated by their failure’ to
demonstrate similar vexation over the
more grievous, long-standing atrocities
perpetrated by the Soviet" government
(dare I say ‘ ‘evil empire? ’?) against its
own people as well as those of
neighboring nations (most notably
Afghanistan). Where is the prophetic
moral witness of the Pitt Chaplains
Association on behalf of those op-
pressed peoples? Where is the sum-
mons to fasting, protests, letter-

7 writing, ribbon-wearing .and ﬁnancial

generosity for the noble Afghan peo-
ple? To be sure, such moral incon-
integrity of the chaplains’ particular
position on apartheid. But their selec-
tive indignation does call into question
the integrity of the Pitt Chaplains
Association itself.

If they wish to be taken seriously as
moral spokesmen on this campus,‘ the
Pitt Chaplains will have to divest
themselves of any hidden agendas.

  Speaker Assailed A

I was not shocked or surprised to
see a title of a front page article,
“ ‘Left-brain’ people dominate the
world, lecturer says." The surprise
was that it came from a university
newspaper and not the National
Enquirer or similar tabloid. Respon-
sible journalism dictates that the
article’s author, Ms. Zollner, or her
editor should have checked with at
least one psychology professoror
opened one introduction to psychol-
ogy textbook to verify the outrage-
ous claims attributed to the lecturer,
LaDonna Bates. Yet the Pitt News
article was presented without com-
ment, in the style of what I inter-
preted as a straight news story (front
page yet!). This does a disservice to
both the researchers in the field of
neuropsychology who try to sort out
fact from fiction and to the unini-
tiated reader who will come away
from this article believing such fan-
tasies are true.

I know from direct sources that
the lecturer, LaDo.nna Bates, has a
number of fine credentials as a social
worker, -writer and lecturer. But

expertise in neuropsychology ; —_

brain research — is not one of them.
She has undoubtedly read _a great

deal in the field, but I doubt that she
ever "met, let alone “worked with.”
Nobel laureate Roger Sperry. The
other person, Barbara Vitale, from
whom Ms. Bates had received
“information and inspiration” is like
herself: widely read on the subject
but not a neuropsychologist and,
quite frankly, incorrect on a number
of her unvalidated conclusions.

I am sure that Ms. Bates, like Ms.
Vitale and like a frightening number
of others, strongly believes they are
correct in their observations and
conclusions; they feel validation will
come in due time. -It is my conclusion
that the principle “a little bit of
knowledge is dangerous" is at work
here. It would be a never-ending bat-
tle to crusade against such individu-
als. As long as there are people who
believe in phrenology, there will be
phrenologists; as long as there are
those who believe in astrology, there
will be astrologists. P.T. Barnum
has proved over and over that there
is a “fool born every minute."

But I can condemn a university
newspaper for pprpetrating these
myths. A news organization in a
scholarly institution such as the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh has the respon-
sibility to place its “news” in context.
I would challenge Ms. Bates to pro-
vide, or Pitt News’_ Ms. Zollner to
find, any scientific evidence for the

‘descriptions or claims reported in
the article. I appeal to the editor of
The Pitt News to provide a follow-
up, front-page article disclaiming
Ms. Bates’ personal observations as
being unfounded on scientific fact.
There are plenty of valid, interesting
and important cognitive functions
that can be attributed to processing
by the right and left cerebral hemis-
pheres as demonstrated by a host of
reputable researchers in peer-

reviewed journals. Ms. Bates‘ obser- i

vations are not, to my knowledge,
among them.

Intervention in Afghanistan and Nicaragua 

Consistency may be a hobgoblin of
small minds as Thomas Jefferson sug-
gested, but surely inconsistency does
not make genius. Frequent inconsisten-
cy (or hypocrisy in moralist terms) in
political debates is revealed by con-
demning an adversary for precisely the

same activities that one is engaged in I

or advocating. Many people who are
critical of the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan were elated with the U.S.
invasion of Grenada and heartily ap-
plaud U.S. policy in Nicaragua.

It seems only ﬁtting that we judge all
states by the same code of conduct. It
only adds to the confusion and con-
tributes to the distortion of the issues
to claim that either side is evil. The
parallels between the Soviet involve-

ment in Afghanistan and American in-
volvement in Nicaragua are striking to
any reasonable observer.

Some, like Zbignew Brzezinski, go
as far as to argue that because of these
similarities an opportunity for a quid
pro quo exists. We can trade
Afghanistan for Nicaragua. We can in-
sure that Nicaragua will not oppose our
regional interests by insuring that
Afghanistan does not oppose the
Soviets’ regional interests. It is as if we
b%th remove the thorn from the other’s
51 e.

Yet Brzezinski goes too far: In the
name of realpolitick he offers
something we do not have for
something the Soviet Union does not
have. The opposition to the Soviet

Union is indigenous. Be it for religious

.reasons or purely political ones,

Afghan guerrillas and sympathizers

' ache for national self-determination. ,

We may arguably be arming them, but
we surely do not control them. Similar-
ly, the Soviet Union does not have
Nicaragua to give. The Sandinistas and
their political allies did not overthrow
Somoza to replace him witha Soviet
dupe. Like the Afghans, the people in
Nicaragua desire national sovereignty.

Moreover, even if we could make
such a trade, why should the Soviets
agree to it? In both their support of the
Sandinistas and their domination of
Afghanistan, the Soviet Union supports
the political status quo. On one hand,
the Sandinistas have been in power for

six years, andontheother, Afghanistan
has had a pro-Soviet regime throughout
the post-World War H period. The
status quo carries great weight and
authority in international circles.
Changing it is usually associated with
instability and revisionism.

Furthermore, even the mere sugges-
tion of such a deal, no matter how far-
fetched, is irresponsible. By selling out
those that President Reagan calls
freedom ﬁghters, American credibili-
ty among friends and allies is effective-
ly undermined.

Instead, at the upcoming superpower
summit, the United States should bold-
ly propose the establishment of a non-
intervention regime whereby both

superpowers would refrain from send-
ing any oftheir armed forces, 
clandestine paramilitary groups (like
the KGB or CIA operatives responsi-
ble for mining Nicaragua’s harbors) in-
to any Third World country, even if in-
vited. This mutual self-restraint would
contribute to the stabilization of many
volatile regions, including the Persian

Gulf. The United States and the Soviet
Union each have an interest in keep-
ing the other out of the Third World,

and the Third World supports the ex-
clusion of both superpowers. Conse-
quently, a non-intervention regime
would reﬂect converging interests of
the East, West and South. This would
serve to depolarize and  the
world.

Simply Speaking/ Jeff Thompson

The Importance of Using Your Vote

It’s that time of year again. Fall is
in the air and Congress is back in ses-
sion after summer recess. Many issues
face the legislators, both in Washington

and in Harrisburg, and many of them -

concern you, the student, so you should
keep youself well informed. And most
importantly, use that political leverage
which helps to make things happen:
your vote. It’s the most useful inﬂuence
you have over policy, and when com-
bined with others it makes policy.

‘ Inwashington right now, adraftbill
is being prepared in the House Post-
secondary Education Subcommittee

concerning the Higher Education Act.
Title N of this act concerns student aid
programs suchasthePellGrantandthe
Guaranteed Student Loan Program.
Panels of students have been testifying
both to the House and the Senate sub-
committees on higher education as to
the necessity of govemment-sponsored
student aid for their access to higher
education. As you may already know,
our secretary of education is in favor
of cutting down on such programs.
Many students will be hurt if this hap-
pens. If you are one of these students,
you should, and do, have something to
say.

Senator Arlen Specter is on the
Senate subcommittee having to do with
new appropriations, including student
aid.

Another major issue which promises
to stay in the headlines quite a while
is that of tax reform. One aspect of the
plan is to eliminate the deductibility of

‘stateandlocaltaxeslfthesetaxesare

made non-deductive for federal income
taxes, people who are currently pay-
mg more state taxes than they need to
(in order to deduct that extra amount
from their federal income tax) will pay
fewer. State and local governments

would then be forced to cut allocations
for many services, including education,
in order to make up for the lost
revenue.

Many people will recall the Grove
City decision of the Supreme Court in
early 1984. The court maintained that
it was not unconstitutional for federal
funds to be used to subsidize colleges
and universities which practice
discrimination in their entrance
policies. Federal funds can be used at
any institution which practices
discrimination, as long as the actr@_
recipient of the funds does not

discriminate. For example, if univer-
sity X has policies prohibiting the ad-

mission of certain types of people, any ,

departmentwrthm’ ' thatuniversityisstill
eligible for federal research grants so
long as that department does not itself
practice discrimination. The large-scale
holeinthisisbothobviousandsurpris-
ing. The Civil Rights Restoration Act
of 1985 will, if passed, ensure that
federal funding will not go to such
schools.

The issues are there. The informa-
tron is there. It is up to you to make
use of them. Use your vote.

Much of every boy or girl’s
childhood is devoted to playtime, they
develop their bodies and minds, build
friendships and stretch their imagina-
tions. And it's fun. But for a handi-
capped child, conventional playground
equipment and toys are often useless
and beyond his physical capacity.

The Western Center in Canonsburg,
Pa. and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity at Pitt
will team up for a 24-hour wheelchair
“Push-a-thon” through Pittsburgh
Nov. 1-2 to raise money for specially
designed play units for the severely

one is always an improvement on the

$17,000 — according to Amygdalos.

Amygdalos cited the need to make
Pittsburghers more aware of the pro-

unit for this area. He said he hopes for
local visibility and support as the
“Push-a-thon” takes off from the

VOL‘ 3. No. 3  October 18, 1985

By John Young

The Romantics play unpretentious,
upbeat songs written with a smart pop
sensibility. And they've been‘ doing
that since their inception.

“When we started out back in l977,
we had a definite idea of what kind of
sound we wanted to come across with,
and we’ve never really forsaken that,”
explained lead vocalist and guitarist
Wally Palmar during a phone interview
Monday. “We’re not trying to pull
anything over anyone’s ‘ eyes. Our
‘songs are pretty much straight ahead,

they're danceable and they're fun for-

us and hopefully fun for the listener,

too.” - “ -
Since the band formed in Detroit, its

members are influenced musically by

Pro Pp  _  
  Roman tics promise rock-n-

everything from the Motown sound to
the acts of the British Invasion.

“Everything that we were exposed
to kind of stuck with us, and we're able
to show it in the songs we write,”
Palmar said, talking from Detroit, still
the band's home base.

The group is currently touring in sup-
port of their latest Nemperor release,
“Rhythm Romance.” They've been
playing dates for the past two weeks;
concentrating on shows at college
campuses, along a hotbed of support
for the band. This Saturday, the
Romantics perform at the Carnegie-
Mellon University gym at 8 p.m.

This tour comes at a critical time for
the band. Drummer and sometime
lead vocalist Jimmy Marinos left the
band last year, leaving Palmar,
guitarist Coz Canler and bassist Mike

Skill with a gap to fill. They chose
David Petratos to take Marinos’ place,
and the newest member of the Roman-
tics seems to be working well with the
rest of the group.

“David’s doing a very good job,”
Palmar noted. “lt’s kind of different for
us live, obviously, playing with a new
drummer ‘cause we had the same
drummer for seven years. But things
have come together very well.”

Petratos has even taken over the
lead vocals on number. of songs
Marinos sang. “We wanted to give
Dave achance, and he lived up to it,"
Palmar added. “David is a good singer
and he’s been doing a good job."

The Romantics have responded to
a number of changes both inside and
outside their group since forming. One

placed on videos as a means of pro-
moting the band. Palmar feels the clips
have become as important as touring
for insuring big sales of singles and
albums. The medium is one the band
enjoys, though, and as established ar-
tists they now have more control over
their videos. ~

‘‘If anybody knows how we should
look and how we should come across,
the band does," Palmar said. “So right
now we're in a position where we have
a little more say-so and we're looking
forward to it, especially since we're
filming a new video for ‘Mystified’ in
about two weeks.”

Patsy Cline story turns “S

By Matthew Yokobosky

In recent years, the theme of coun-
try attitudes and lifestyles has invaded
popular culture. As film is a reflection
of society, movies like Urban Cowboy
and Places in the Heart have become
box-office successes. Country music,
as an extension of this movement, has
also gained attention, and consequent-
ly,_all of the legends who helped create
this musical genre have been
remembered and praised for their con-
tnbutions. As such, the newest coun-
try film to reach theaters is Karel

.Fleisc’s Sweet Dreams, a portrait of

Patsy Cline. ,
Starring Jessica Lange, Sweet
Dreams recounts Cline’s triumphant
struggle for success and wealth in the
entertainment industry. Unfortunately,
the film makes a greater spectacle of
her turbulent home life rather than her
talent. in the vein of Coal- Miner's
Daughter, ‘ we see Cline’s broken
home, her early marriage, her second
marriage and her constant battle as a

battered wife. Though this chain of '.

events does help to_keep the film kick-

ing, it never quite makes a statement

about Cline’s overzealous need of at-
tention or how her domesticiproblems
influenced her career. Why does she
keep returning to her abusive hus-
band, and what exactly happened dur-
ing her childhood to cause her pater-
nal hatred? ’

Jessica Lange, Oscar winner for

Tootsie and nominatio_n_s_ for Frances

After Hours:

By Robin Shepherd

Things just aren't going well tonight
for Paul, a mild-mannered Manhattan
word» processor-operator. Out of
loneliness, he has taken a cab down
to Sollo to see Marcy, a girl he met
earlier in a coffee shop, only to have
his last $20 ﬂy out of the taxi’s window.
Upon arrival, he meets Kiki, Marcy's
spacey sculptress roommate, and
begins longing to return to the safety
of his own apartment.

Alas; it ill» not to be as his evening
turns into one misadventure after
another, introducing him to a variety of
bizarre characters and culminating in
a terrifying manhunt through the dark
city streets. '

and Country, portrays Cline as a hard-
assed, lusty, western siren, presenting
her in -a very three-dimensional man-
ner. She dances in parking lots, jails
her husband for brutality and even
convinces-her mother to become a
talent scout to get herself on the Arthur
Godfrey Show. Lange, who often
seems to play herself, abandoned her

usual soft-spoken charm and adopted

Cline’s Tennessee twang, flirtatious
walk, occasionally battered face and
uninhibited desire for love to emerge
as a convincing country legend. Lange
is progressing as an actress, and
Patsy Cline may be her best
characterization to date.

As for Ed Harris, who plays Cline’s
second husband Charlie Dick, he ap-
pears to be graduating as a screen ac-

 

tor, though at a snaiI’s pace. His
previous work in Phillip Kaufmann’s
The Right Stuff and Jonathon
Demme's Swing Shift was all too
planned and unnatural to accredit his
efforts as spontaneous or well-
executed. in addition, Harris’ face,
while having a good structural com-
position, never changes its “nice guy"
expression, making him look like the
same character in every movie, except
with a different mood or attitude.
Nevertheless, one positive aspect of
Harris’ portrayal of Charlie was his
dialogue which, like Lange's, was
filled with numerous colloquial phrases

like “bumpin’ uglies,” which added a

spice to this sparsely intellectual
drama.
On the whole, Sweet Dreams suffers

eet Dreams” sour

  

from Cline’s too-brief life history and

career. Perhaps if a detailed account ‘

of her youth was added or lnterspllced,
the film would have played up her
peculiar tolerance for men's incon-
sistencies as well as addressing why
Cline remained a prisoner to domestic ‘
life rather than concentrating on her
lifelong goal of success. Lange’s per-
formance will most definitely. be
recognized when Oscar time ap-\
proaches. As for the film, it will only
become a memory of Patsy Cline and

not a landmark of her achievements as -

a short-lived country superstar/legend.

Sweet Dreams had me singing Cline’s 

infamous "l’ll Fall to Pieces" as I ex-
ited from the theater. i only wish that
the film itself was as great as the
musical legacy Patsy Cline left behind.

one misadventure after another

Sound like one of your worst
nightmares? Well, tapping into these
fears is the premise for After Hours, the
latest project by director Martin

Scorsese of Raging ‘Bull and “Taxi”

Driver” fame. Besides its familiarity to
city-dwellers, newcomer Joseph Min-
ion’s screenplay captivates audience
interest through its original and
decidedly offbeat humor.

A film this “extreme and controver-
sial,” as admitted by co-producer Amy
Robinson, needs better than average
acting performances to maintain its

credibility. Fortunately, the large cast, ,

displays a universal talent and an ob-
vious enthusiasm for the material.

HERE'S TO FUTURE DAYS
Thompson Twins
Arista

The Thompson Twins first hit the
American pop charts in the spring of
' 1983 with their dance-synth hit “Lies,”

. but they did not gain national fanfare

until their third album Into the Gap was
released. Their fourth ballad, “Hold Me
“Now,” was overplayed coast-to-coast,
solidly recognizing their new status as
superstars. On their current album
titled Here's to Future Days, it appears
that they’ve finally combined their
talents for writing thoughtful lyrics and
well-balanced rhythms to emerge with
'-ne of the sleekest albums this year.
Produced by Tom Bailey, Alex
Sadkin (Grace Jones) and Nile Rogers
(Madonna, Duran Duran, Bowie),
Here's to Future Days explores the
combination of dance tracks with
clever wording and confidently mixes

V the two with a musical expertise rare-

ly heard in today's market. “Lay Your
Hands on Me," their first single, is
reminiscent of “Sister of Mercy,”
though it utilizes Bailey's subtle piano
and Alannah Currie’s softly tender
lyrics to become one of the many gems
on the album. The phrase, ‘‘I see your
face and sense the grace and feel the

  Thoss fine tune  
  and head for charts

magicin her touch,” while lyrical on its
own, is emphasized by matching
instrumentation.

The last noteworthy remake of a
LennonlMcCartney composition has
not been heard since David Bowie’s
1976 “Across the Universe.” But now,
a decade later, The Twins’ version of
“Revolution" promises to hold the ti-
tle for many years. While retaining the
original power and verbal strength,
they have introduced Rogers-
influenced electronic sequences and
Steve (Billy idol fame) Stevens’ riveting
guitar to update the classic anthem.

The other songs on the first side are
mainly dance-oriented pop hymns.
Nevertheless, through clever mixing
and the help of Stevens and the East
Harlem Hobo Choir, the songs con-
sistently keep your feet pounding out
every antsy beat.

On the flip side, we hear a digres-
sion back to their first two albums. It's
a rejuvenation of their earlier unsuc-

cessful material, creating a smoothly ’ ~

bouncy collection of songs. The
scheduled second release “King for a
Day” opens this side, and while mild-
ly cute, it’s full of fun and assured of
gaining the under-21 audience.

The last track is more artistically ar-
ticulated and more musically sound.

“You Killed the Clown” begins and
ends with a full-bodied saxophone
solo. Its chorus and background
xylophone recall Elton John's version
of “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds”
yet does not rely on John's previous
fingering for strength. As always, The
Thompson Twins build on previous

\ material, but it is developed as a

means to update and expand rather

than a cop-out.

Here's to Future Days combines
many different musical backgrounds
and styles into one unified album.
Whether it’s their references to
previously successful works, ethnic
Japanese rhythms reminiscent of
Y.M.O. and "Kamakazee," or futuristic
synthesizer solos, this musically

  

literate group succeeds in every
aspect. After Bailey's collapse from ex-
haustion while completing this album
in Paris, he swore that he'd produce
their best work to date, and he kept his
promise. “Lay Your Hands on Me” is
an assured hit, while the rest of the
record remains as an exhaustibly in-
fectious box ofaural candy. As the ti-
tle song declares: Here's to future
days, here's to future ways. As such,
the airwaves appear destined to be lit-
tered with The Twins’ tunes. You know
how America likes to wear out a good
album. '

BACK INTO BLUE

Quarterflash
‘Geffen Records

Mix together banal, cliched lyrics, a

thin instrumental sound and an

onslaught of bland synthesizer tracks,
and you're likely to come up with an
album similar to Quarterﬂash’s Back

_ Into Blue. But just to keep things in-

teresting, add some occasionally con-
vincing, relaxed singing and a pair of

 

likable love ballads to frustrate the
listener prepared to dismiss the entire
record as a waste of time.

— Steve Levine, noted for his work with
Culture Club, produced the latest
Quarterflash record, and he clearly
demonstrates his penchant for using
synthesizers. The overriding use of

£~- keyboards reduces Marv Ross’ guitar
work to faint rumblings and almost
completely hides Rich Gooch’s bass
playing. Drummer Brian David Willis’
playing comes to the forefront.
however. The electronic sound of h
drums fits in well with the album
high-tech leanings. ,
Surprisingly,'despite the numerous
-synth tracks Levine inserts, the in-
strumental sound is not particularly
full. Vast separation exists between the
individual instruments, and they rare-

ly form one compelling, collective

sound.

. Although Quarterflash has a new in-
strumental sound, singerlsaxophonist
Rindy Ross. remains the group's

‘centerpiece. Her voice on Back Into
Blue is at times appealing. Her leaps
into sweet falsetto singing on various
short phrases add warmth to her
delivery. But all too often, she strikes
the tough girl pose and winds up
sounding silly. At least her sax breaks
still pack a punch. _ -

Finally, the songs on Back Into Blue
are standard fare for the band. In some
cases they appear to have mastered
writing romantic ballads. “Walking on
Ice" and ‘'I Want to Believe It's You”

und convincing as Ross sings them.
But most of the songs turn out to be
dull, cliche-ridden tracks aimed at AOR
radio listeners. “Just For You" with its
Berlin posings and the laughable
“Welcome to the City" stand out as
the album's worst offerings.

Quarterflash has moments on Back
Into Blue where they sound ready to
break out of the mold of a standard
pop/rock band. But in the end, they re-
ly on too many tried and true formulas

of radio rock, abandoning their at- ’

tempts to sound original.

GET OUT OF MY ROOM
Cheech & Chong
MCA

After five years on the screen,
Cheech and Chong came back to vinyl
with Get Out Of My Room! Mixing both
music and comedy, this album delivers
the same old hilarity but, surprisingly,
without all the drug references. Bring-
ing back the well-known characters of
Blind Baby and Tyrone Shoelaces and
adding new chuckles with Juan Coyote
and Warren Beatty, this album un-
doubtly reaches their fans’ funny
bones. _

The first cut on the album is “Born
In East L.A." With all its sarcasm,
Cheech explains it was inspired by a
true story: “Yes, it is about a U.S.
citizen who was deported by the

~ Department of Immigration and spent
several days  Tijuana before being

.4

re-admitted to the country of his birth."

Chong adds, “Born in East L.A. ef- ”

fectively but gently bursts’ narrow

. stereotypes of what constitutes an

American.” V

“Born in East L.A.” is one of five
videos planned in conjunction -with
tracks from the lp. The others are ‘‘I’m

Not Home Right Now,” “Get Out of My '

Floom,” “Love, is Strange” and .a
much-umentary spoofing the making
of these videos. ‘

Chong vinyls yet, grab‘ this one before
it’s banned. ~ .

COLD—IRON

Nick Gilder
MCA

. The last time I heard or saw Nick‘

Gilder was when he opened for the

» Outlaws in 1978. As soon as Gilder,
wearing black spandex pants and a
blue-sequined jacket, walked out in
front of the audience, filled with
southern-rocking rednecks, one got
the immediate. impression that the man

‘responsible for getting him this show
was now laughing about the awful joke
he had played on the unsuspecting
Canadian.

Gilder didn't even reach the chorus
of “Hot'ChiId in the City" before he
was pelted with beer bottles and
cascaded with abuse. But the thing I
remember the most about the show is
that I left the arena thinking that Gilder
was a man of character, for when he
was forced to stop playing, instead of
flipping the audience the finger as I
surely would have done, he thanked
them very much, and looking meek but
dignified, walked off the stage with his
head held high.

' A few months after that, however,
Gilder disappeared from the music
scene. He has only completed his sec-
ond album since then, his .same-

named debut for RCA. The press
release seems to blame this seven-
year lapse in his career on his image
at the time, saying that “despite his
success with ‘Hot Child’ or perhaps
because of it, some of Gilder’s
business arrangements went sour."
Gilder must have either believed this
or let the record company's hype "per-
‘sonnel convince him so, because more
than anything, this record is a con-
scious effort to renounce the past and
to give Gilder a more masculine image.

For instance, on this "cover he no
longer looks like a skinny glam-rocker.
He's clad in a leather jacket and a flan-

A nelshirt, and is pulling a thick red rope

with his muscles straining and his face
wearing an expression of rugged
concentration.

In addition, the release plays up the
fact that Gilder has survived the years
by writing songs for others, including

“The Warrior," a big hit last year for’

Scandal, while downplaying the fact
that all the ‘songs he has written have
been sung by women. .
Perhaps this is the reason he
doesn't sing falsetto on this album.
Maybe he's afraid he'll be mistaken for

. a woman or, even worse, a fag.

Instead he uses something that the
press release mentions over and over
again as his "new-found vocal power.”
They even go to the trouble of de-
scribing it as "full-bodied, but witha
rough edge that suggests feelings that
reach ‘deeper than mere rock-and-roll
posturing.” .
' However, what his voice really
sounds like is a second-hand Bryan
Adams, but a lot worse. At least Adams
sings in this bland over-melodramatic
fashion because hehas no choice.
With Gilder, I know better. Gilder tries
to sing like something he's not and as
a result, nothing on this album comes
close to being half as good as “Hot
Child” was. In fact, this record is little
more than a collection of insincere love
songs.

If Gilder opened for the Outlaws
now, I still think he'd be chased off the
stage, but not as before. He's suc-
ceeded in sufficiently forsaking that im-
age. This time it would be merely
because his music really sucks.

And some not-so-goodies. Kinda

do, you can play Spot The
Gratuitous Sexist Remark which
I have hidden in one of the
reviews. Actually, ,it’s a fairly
harmless comment that should
only bother Wham! fans. (Oh,
what a giveaway!)

Arcadia: Election Day  
Arcadia is what is left of Duran

Duran after two out of three Taylors'

defected and formed the much more
interesting Power Station. This band's
forthcoming album is titled So Red the
Rose, but if this single is any indica-
tion, it should have been called So
Dead the Doze. The last (and only)
good record Duran Duran made was
Rio. Everything since has been a co-
lossal bore. “Election Day” further ex-
plores Simon Le Bon’s fondness for
obscure lyrics, tuneless melodies and
frankly weird harmonies, but it's not
even bad enough to make you look up,
and boring is worse than bad. At least
bad can be interesting. I suspect the
teen-age girls aren't going to scream
for these guys much longer if they
keep churning out crap like this.

John Cougar Mellencamp: Lonely OI’ ‘

Night .

I've said it before, and no one
believed me, so I'll say it again a little
louder: This guy’s new album is very

good. As I might have predicted, the
best songs ("Small Town," "From a
Laugh to. a Tear") have not been
released as singles, but “Lonely OI’
Night" will do. Mellencamp’s
songwriting technique is crude — his
credo seems to be “Always use
straight major chords and nothing
tricky” — but, at times, it is effective.
(Actually, this song" has an E-
suspended-fourth chord in it, but don't
tell John. He probably doesn't realize
it.) Anyway, “Lonely 0|’ Night" is
good, hearty American country-rock,
free of any ridiculous patriotic slogans
or excessive sentimentality. Mellen-

Even though this song is a grab-bag

melody. Still, it's pretty stupid, as

and were ashamed to have recorded
it. “Alive and Kicking,” released in ad-
vance of Simple Minds’ forthcoming
album, shows what they can do when
left to their own devices. The song
picks up where the band left off on
their 1982 album, New Gold Dream.
(1983's Sparkle in the Rain, according
to vocalist Jim Kerr. was an interesting
but limited digression.) It begins slow-
ly, moodily, with droning synthesizers
against a basic rhythm backdrop, just

. the right amount of distorted guitar

‘way in the background and Kerr
growling in his chesty baritone. Then
it builds, piece by piece: Backing
vocals are introduced, Kerr's singing
turns impassioned, and the whole

band blows into a chorus that makes —

the hair on the back of your neck near-
ly jump out of your skin. Few groups
have mastered the kind of sustained
power that Simple Minds can generate
effortlessly. A helluva good tune.

The Smiths: The Boy With the Them in

The fact that the Smiths are all gay

' The fact is, only a handful of groups

on either side of the Atlantic can match

The Smiths for sheer musicality and .

melodicism, and I can't think of anyone
who can beat them. Morrissey's voice
. is certainly an acquired taste, but as
long as The Smiths continue to pro-
duce singles as heartbreakingly
beautiful as this one, I'm not going to
nitpick. Here Morrissey adds a- few
new tricks (yodeling?) to his falsetto
bag of tricks, but the song is firmly in

  IIIE IBIIIISIIEII

By Dave Zuchowski

David Stock is a composer and the
conductorlfounder of the New Music
Ensemble, one of 10 top groups of its
kindin the country. As a composer, he
has received commissions from the
Pittsburgh Symphony, American Vlﬁnd
Symphony and the Pittsburgh
Chamber Music Society. Currently on
the faculty at the University of Pitts-
burgh, Stock agreed to talk with us

' 9 about the ensemble, his work, the

state of new music in general and its
growing young audience.

Show: What chronological period
constitutes “New Music?"

Stock: A great deal of what we play
is really recent — I mean the past 10
years. But we feel that the whole 20th
century is our province. We usually
play in each concert a work from the
earlier part of the century. But you
know that's old by now '— it's “old New
Music." Our main interest is America,
but we occasionally play works by
foreign compomrs. We feel that music
starts at home and starts in our own
time. If you look at most concert
organizations, such as symphony or-
chestras or choruses, you ll find, its
just the other way around — their
repertoire is momly by European com-
posers of the past. So we turn around
and do American composers of the
present or the recent past.

Show: Are there any composers to-
day writing music in the style of, say,
the Baroque or Romantic Era?

Stock: People are writing today just

about every kind of music you can

think of. I don't know how successful-
ly, necessarily. I think it's impossible
to recreate without getting into kitsch
— you know, a past style. I mean, peo-
ple talk about composing in the style
of Bach or composing in the style of
Brahms. I don't think that's compos-
ing. I think that's arranging. It's a very,
very tricky aesthetic and political ques-
tion, but I don't think it's really compos-
ing. There are people who think of
themselves veryconsciously as neo-
romantic composers andsometimes
with a certain degree of success. I
think the ones that are less conscious
about it are maybe more successful at
it.

What we've found, certainly in the
last 10 years or so, is that more and
more composers. have wanted to re-
establish the tie with the audience. I
think we went through a period when
composers who looked for a large au-
dience were looked down on by their
colleagues. I think we've come through
that now. I think there's a lot of people
writing very difficult kinds of music who
really want to appeal to a good-sized
audience.

Show: What about the current
American audience acceptance of new
music?

Stock: It's very variable. There are
-some things that go down very well,
and there are some things that are
more difficult. It also depends on the
audience. If you're talking about the
large audience of the symphony, there
are only certain types of pieces that will
have instant appeal, but, you see, ‘art
isn't just about instant appeal. I mean,
there are great pieces which takea lit-
tle longer. Every composer has to find
his own way to the point that balances
what an audience wants and what he
wants to create. .
. We've built a very solid audience for
the NME concerts. It's not a very large
audience by symphony standards.

- What we do, though, is so different

from what a symphony does. We are

in the moment; we're now. And I think
there's great appeal there for young
people. In many cases they just
haven't discovered us yet. «

All the rock people know about elec-
tronic music and synthesizers, and
usually, each year, we have something
with electronics at every concert. Most
of them have heard of Phil Glass or
Steve Reich, and we occasionally play
their music or music that's influenced
by them. Anybody with an open mind
or spirit of adventure will like our
concerts. M

I should mention that we are offer-
ing the students a discounted
subscription — $15 for the remaining
six concerts. If they want to take ad-
vantage of it, they can call 244-9996,

St” **

and if they say they read about it in The
Pitt News, we'll give them a special
secret bonus. _ .

Show: How do you go about selec-
ting your repertoire for each season?

Stock: Well, there's a committee of
composers from the Pittsburgh
Alliance of composers and performers
from the group, and each year we sift
through the huge stack of scores that
people or publishers send us. I find
things. I find composers I'm interested
in and ask them to send me their work.
So tons of music just pass before us,
and we pick those things we find best
for our group and our audiences.

Show: The number of musicians in
the group varies from 5 to 15, depen-
ding on the concert. Are they usually
the same musicians from concert to
concert, or do they vary?

Stock: Well, there's a core group,
but when we need extras, we try to
keep the same ones. I mean, when we
need a second ﬂute — we normally
have only one ﬂute in the group — we
try to always hire the same second
ﬂutist’.

Show: I also notice you usually have
a guest artist at each concert.

Stock: Yes, we usually have at least
one guest soloist, and they are legen-
dary performers. Bertram Turetski is
known worldwide as a bass player.
Joan LaBarbara is known interna-
tionally as a pioneer in vocal tech-
niques. For our next concert on Oct.
21, Kate Young, probably known bet-

ter in Pittsburgh as an actress. will be
performing with us, where she will be
reciting, acting and singing. On Nov.
18, John Sampen, the saxophonist,
will be premiering a piece especially
written for him to play with the NME.
John, again, is a nationally recognized
sax player.

Show: How do you network out the
guest artist you want to bring in to per-
form with the NME?

Stock: That's no problem. There are

more people out there that we know of _

than we could ever bring in. Just in
singers alone I have a waiting list, so
to speak. Susan Bellam, who sang
with the New York Opera, and Lucy

     

\_~\)
xi

Shelton, who-sang all over the coun-
try — we want to bring them in to sing.
Part of it is the way our culture is
geared. There are superstars and then
there's everybody else, and, a
superstar is somebody who's been on
Johnny Carson. We're ireallyﬂooking
for top quality and forgetting about the
hype. The situation is unfortunate
because there's a lot of wonderful
talented people who go by the way.

Show: What's going on in Pitts-
burgh as far as new music
composition?

Stock: There's a certain number of
composers here who are active. The
focus is the Pittsburgh Alliance of

‘Composers. Byron McCulIoh of the

Pittsburgh Symphony has been the
president of the group for the past

three years. There are people who I

teach at the universities as well as re-
cent graduates who compose. Among
the better known are Lou Coyner, who
teaches at Chatham, and Leonardo
Balada, who teaches at Carnegie-
Mellon. Marilyn Taft Thomas, who also
teaches at CMU, is making herself
known in the computer music ﬁeld.

Among the younger people, several
recent graduates from the University
of Pittsburgh, James Lovendusky and
Rezi Vali, are both very active as com-
posers. We are taking a piece Loven-
dusky wrote for us on the fall tour.
Stephen Block, who got his Ph.D. from
Pitt, wrote a couple of pieces that we
are taking on the fall tour and the tour
to New York.

Show: What are your feelings about
rock music? ‘ ‘ '

Talking Stock:Ensemble prepares for opening

Stock: I like a lot of it. I have two
teenage daughters who are 17 and 14,
and I like some of what they listen to,
but I guess they have very good taste.

Show: Could you give me an
example?

Stock: Well, the most recent record
that I go ostensibly for myself that is
practically worn out is Sting’s new
album.

But I think that a great deal of what's
played on commercial radio is trash. I
think it's very, very big business. My
favorite analogy to it is fast-food ham-
burgers-. Now, fast-food hamburgers
are all right if you want a quick meal,
but if you ate nothing but hamburgers

three meals a day [and] seven days a
week, you wouldn't develop any taste;

. you wouldn't be able to appreciate a V
fine French or Chinese meal. Music is

the same. If all you heard seven days

a weekwas, vapid commerical stuff,‘
. you would never develop a taste for

anything better.

Show: On the other side of the coin,
how do you feel about older classical
music —- Brahms, Mozart, Bach?

Stock: These are our great
predecessors. I love the music, but I'd
never go to a concert to specifically
hear a piece of the standard orchestral
literature. I mean, to go out of my.way
to hear So-and-So's version of
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony or
Brahm's Violin Concerto sounds in-
sane to me.

Show: What about New Music
Opera?

Stock: Opera's very complicated.
Right now, the most successful opera
composer in American is Phillip Glass.
I have unfortunately never seen any of
the operas and have only heard snip-
pets of them. But in terms of getting
the works produced on a large scale,
he's the most successful. And the fact
that he has had success in an area
where no one really has — and certain-
ly no one ever has in a style that is not
just a rehash of past worn-out styles —
bodes well for the future. What I keep

’ hoping is that we will have cross-over

opera that will really work. For exam-
ple, Stephen Sondheim is a person
who has worked in _ the Broadway
theater. Now some of his work is be-
ing done in the opera house. I would
rather see him write something that
was specifically geared to the opera
house, whether he used opera singers

or not, because Broadway singers -‘

might be very effective. Also, I'd like
to see someone from the upper
echelons of the artistic rock world find
some workable way to make viable
music theater. I'm sorry, Andrew Lloyd
Webber does not do it for me. He's the
most financially successful composer

, ‘in the world, but I think what he writes

is amateurish junk. He's very good at
putting shows together, but he's not
very good at putting music together.

Show: Now the NME is in its 10th
season. How have you grown and
changed-over the years?

Stock: When we first started, we
worked on an absolute shoestring. In
our first season, our budget was
maybe $5,000. Now it's $130,000 a
year. Only a miniscule amount of that
is funded by ticket sales. We have to
work very hard to raise money — all art
does. We have to work even harder
than most because we're seen as be-
ing something away from the
mainstream. But we are the
mainstream. When the history of music
and art of the 20th century is written,
it will be groups like ours that will be
most noteworthy, not the large well-
financed operations. They're afraid to
take too many risks. We exist only to

take risks.

Studio opens

A strange and very alluring pair of
one-act plays by Sam Shepherd and
Joseph Chakin opened the Studio
Theatre's season last weekend — just
the sort of experimental theater you
like and might even expect to see on
an academic stage. Tongues and
Savage/Love are just the sort of in-
timate drama that suit the tiny, box-like
theater deep in the basement of the
Cathedral of Learning.

I’d like to describe Tongues as a play

about life, death and everything in be-'

tween, which would be the safest thing
to say about it. But because there ap-
pears to be no real plot in the conven-
tional sense, it’s difficult to put any

defies convention. For close to 45
minutes, one man (Jean Pierre Nutini),
seated in a straight chair facing the au-
dience, talks. Of course, it's much
more than that: He communicates with
vocal characterizations and without
ever moving from the chair. To inten-
sify the drama of his speech, the
speaker is accompanied by the
sometimes eerie, sometimes violent
rhythms of raw percussions — wind
chimes, wooden blocks, cow bells,
bongos et al.

With this combination, the “play"
becomes a poetic series of vignettes

death — enacting a sort of “life

a word, Tonight I'm learning its
language.

If there is a leading character here,
it is not the speaker, but the speech,

making Tongues a metaphor for the -

Scorsese's direction manages to‘
keep the focus of the film in perspect-

as this has the danger of falling into

Unique touches, such as a loudly tick-

Orson Welles: 1915-1985

“By Stephen Morrison

One night when I was about 12, after
everyone else in the house had gone
to sleep, I defiantly stayed up late wat-
ching whatever was on television. It so
happened that the late movie that
evening was a film about which I had
heard people whisper, entitled “Citizen
Kane." I thought it was ‘interesting
enough, if a bit bombastic, and I fell
asleep about halfway through. But
somewhere in the back of my brain it
made an impression. '

Several years later one of my high
school English teachers was amusing

. herself one day by asking various

’ students in the class what they con-
sidered to be the greatest movie ever
made. While the other kids gave ob-
vious replies like "Gone With the
Wind," “The Sound of Music,” “The
Godfather" and so on, for some
reason I blurted out “Citizen Kane,"
and the teacher was impressed. She
had never seen the film, but one thing
led to another, and by the middle of the
following week we were watching it in
class. My teacher's verdict? ‘

“You're right," she said. “This is the
greatest film I've ever seen.”
“Citizen Kane" was made in 1940,
and its mastermind was Orson Welles,
one of the most baffling and enigmatic
figures in motion picture history. He
was 25 when “Kane" was made,
already famous from his stage and
radio work, but by the time he was 30
his Hollywood career was finished —
he was blackballed. Without major
studio backing, Welles went on to a
haphazard succession of minor films,
highlighted occasionally by small suc-
cesses like “Macbeth," “The Lady
-from Shanghai" and “Touch of Evil."

The remainder of his career was a
sorry procession of unfinished pro-
jects, fat jokes and wine commercials.

Why did Hollywood oust one of its
greatest geniuses? How could the

Furthermore, the public of the '40s
had other things to worry about than

_ an eccentric film director's aesthetic

musings. As The New York Times then
said in reference to “The Magniﬁcent

single most important ﬁgure in the film
Industry In 1941 fade into oblivion by
the end of the war?

Following “Kane," Welles’ next
three projects were a series of
disasters: "Journey into Fear" was
opaque and confusing; “The Magnifi-
cent Ambersons," a beautiful ﬁlm, was
misunderstood and condemned; and
“lt’s All True," an ambitious documen-
tary shot in Latin America, went-far
over budget, endedin complete chaos
and was destroyed by RKO.

Ambersons,” “In a world brimful of
momentous drama beggaring serious
treatment, it does seem that Mr.
Welles is imposing when he asks
moviegoers to become emotionally
disturbed over the decline of such
minor-league American aristocracy as
the Ambersons represented in the late
1870s." -

Even so, the fact that Welles could‘

never really revive his career, let alone
make another great film, is a shameful
comment on the American film [in-

dustry. According to Thomas Weiner
in the -September 1985 issue of

, American Film, “No major director has

had to live with the number of unfin-
ished films that Welles has, a record

. that has reportedly kept him from ob-

taining Hollywood financing for nearly
30 years.” .

Orson Welles died last week at the
age of 70. His tarnished reputation is
belatedly given a measure of vindica-

tion in Robert L. Carringer's new book, '

“The Making of Citizen Kane.” For 44
years a controversy has raged over the
authorship of that film's screenplay:
Welles and Herman J. Manciewicz
.have both claimed sole credit. Car-
ringer at last clears the air once and
for all: “Manciewicz [with assistance
from [John] Houseman and with input

from Welles] wrote the first two drafts. -‘ 1-

 Welles added the narrative brilliance
— the visual and verbal wit, the stylistic
fluidity and such stunningly original
strokes as the newspaper montages
and the breakfast table sequence. He
also transformed Kane from a card-
board fictionalization of [Randolph]
Hearst into a figure of mystery and epic
magnificence.”

It is ironic that only now that the man
is dead are his contributions to his own
work finally acknowledged. Orson
Welles is no longer around to defend
himself. His record will have to stand
or fall on its own merits, and three up-
coming biographies should shed more
light; but Hollywood, for all its latter-day
liberality, has its conscience to live
with. In exiling Orson Welles, it
supressed a man of far-reaching ar-
tistic vision and genius, a man whose
legacy will be remembered long after

the Hollywood movie studios have
fallen into decay and crumbled to dust.

A.B. Brown says C.U. Later as Pit

'~ _ By Patrick Good

For The Pitt News

The life of a head coach never gets
any easier and this week is evidence of
that fact. Pitt Panther head coach Foge
Fazio, in the midst of preparing his
3-2-1 Panthers for a very tough Rutgers
team in Giants Stadium tomorrow, has
had to ﬁght adversity time and time
again. He now ﬁnds himself in one of

«his-toughest positions to date.

Most of his current problems are on
offense where the biggest name has
been injury. He is currently down to
his third and fourth tight ends on the
depth chart and may have to start either
his second- or third-string quarterback
to replace ailing starter John Congemi.
In reference to the quarterback situa-
tion, no word has come about who will
actually start and it may not be known
until game time. Throughout this
season the offense has suffered various
injuries at every position; just lately in-
juries have forced Fazio to have third-
stringers lining up at the wide-out
spots. b

You can attribute a combination of
things such as good recruiting, ex-
cellent athletes, and good coaching to
why the team hasn't suffered too bad-
ly, yet. When I say yet, I'm referring

to the fact that Coach Fazio only has
ﬁve running backs left on his available
roster. —

Why only ﬁve, you may ask?

Well that is because Fazio had to
make the disturbing announcement that
two freshmen rrmning backs left the
team earlier this week. Freshman red-
shirt A.B. Brown and ﬁrst year tailbmk
Eugene Napoleon have left the team
because of what Coach Fazio said
“were strictly football-related
reasons,” and “a lack of playing
time.” .It will be the lost services of
Brown that may hurt the team the most
as he was the immediate replacement
for starter Charles Gladman. Fazio had
this to say about Brown: “That kind
of surprised me, because I thought that
he had a chance to play, and he played.
He was the back-up tailback.”

So far this season, Brown has ap-
peared in every‘ game and was the
starter in the West Virginia and South
Carolina games while Gladman rested
his injury. According to Fazio, “If
Charles (Gladman) got banged up or
hurt or tired early in the game, he
(Brown) was always the ﬁrst to go in
the game.”

Last week against North Carolina
State, Gladman retumed to his position
even though as Fazio remarked, “I
thought in the two games [Brown]
started, he played very well.” Fazio

also said this of Gladman, “We
proved what kind of talent he has when
hewent into the ball game against N.C.
State.” ,

It seems Brown was the only person
who failed to realize Gladman was the
starter when healthy, and that Brown
was" only a replacement. Fazio ex-
plained, “It was understood by
everybodythatcharleswasthestarting
tailback, because he had earned it, you
just don’t lose it (starting position).”

A.B. Brown was once regarded as
one of the top backs in the country
when Pitt recruited him out of Salem‘
High School in New Jersey. In three
seasons be rushed for 4,017 yards
before joining the Panthers a year ago.
While at Salem, Brown set school
records his senior season by gaining

' 2,012 yards and scoring 21 touch-

downs; both single season marks held
by former Penn State great Lyndell
Mitchell.

Backup quarterback Joe Felitsky, the
probable starter if Congemi doesn’t go

against Rutgers, had this to say when

asked if the departures will have any
effects on the team, “I don't think it
will have any bearing on our football
team. We have two great running backs
inCharles GladmanandBrianDavis.”
He then added, “I feel it will make
them play that much harder.”
“This is a hard week especially.‘

We’re playing Rutgers, and both boys
are from New Jersey. ” Like any head
coach in this position, Fazio knows his
team must go on. “Naturally they hate
to see any oftheir teammates leave the

_ ship, but they've got to go on. Hey, we

have a mission to do, we have a battle
to go on to, and they can’t think of
anything but playing good football."

Eugene Napoleon, the other Pitt run-
ningbacktoleave, is alsoaNew Jersey
native. Napoleon, like Brown, brought
excellent credentials with him from St.
Joseph’s High School in Jersey City,
gaining 3,605 yards in three seasons
while scoring 36 touchdowns. He was
named to three High School, All-

. America teams. His high school coach

Frank Gargiulo had this to say when
Napoleon ﬁrst came to Pitt, “I think
he’ll fit in well at Pittsburgh;” also
adding, “ifthingsareright, hecancer-i
tainly help Pitt’s program." .

Apparently things weren‘t right for
either Napoleon or Brown who both
opted to leave the Pitt program behind.
Today both young men ﬁnd themselves
searching for a new university and
another football program that's better
suited, at least in their eyes.

That may not be the case in Fazio’s
eyes, as he enters the Rutgers game
withjust two tailbacks inGladmanand

Darnell Stone. The only other available

Japan destroys
USA; Pitt wins
third straight

By Patrick Good and Ran-
dy Miller _ ~

Staff Writer

The biggest crowd to see a women’s ’

athletic event on the University of Pitt-
sburgh campus witnessed a ﬁne exhibi-
tion of international volleyball last night
as Japan defeated the U.S. National
team three games to one. .
The US fought back from 7-0 and

13-4 deﬁcits to win the opening game‘

15-13.

Japan won the ﬁnal three games to
take the ﬁrst match in the seven-game
nine-day eastern tour. ,

“We certainly didn’t play verywell
tonight,” said US National team coach
Terry Liskevych. “This was our worst
match in the last three months.”

The US won the opening contest with
an impressive_power game that includ-

ed ﬁve spikes -by 6-1- middle blocker I
Caren Kemner. --

Server Bev Robinson contributed
seven service winners with her sinking
line-drive serve. , .

The Japanese won the  three
games 15-5, '15-6, 15-8, with strong
ﬁnesse play. '

“Japan capitalized on our mistakes,”
Kemner said. ‘ ‘I feel we will progress
as the tour goes along.”

The US team must improve to ac-
complish what the 1984 Olympic team
did in winning the silver medal.

“We have a lot of work_ahead of us,”
Liskevych explained. “The main goal

of this tour is ﬁnding out who will be '

on the team in 1988 and who won't be.
We'll be alright. The last time we
played them we beat them three straight
games. ’ ’

Another pitfall for the US is ex-
perience. “Our squad is made up of all
newcomers,” said Liskevych. “Their
team retumed seven players from their
Olympic team.” ,

Many of the 4,087 excited fans in at-
tendance cheered loudly as Kerrmer
continually smashed winners into the
Japanese court.

Liskevych, however, felt she could
have played much better. ~

‘ ‘Tonight Caren Kemner didn’t play

‘as ‘well _ as she is‘ capable of,” '

Liskevych said. “She has played a lot
better in the past and she’ll have to have
better games for us to improve.”
Kemner agreed.“I need a tougher
serve and my defensive blocking isn’t
too good ——.it needsimprovement.”
The improvement can begin tomor-
row night as the two teams square off
again, this time in Philadelphia.

In the preliminary match, Pitt scored
a two-game victory over Big East rival
Providence. The Lady Panthers bat-
tled back in both games and defeated
Providence, 15-10, 18-16.

TVexposure has Pitt football officials irritated

By Randy’ Miller
Staff Writer

Last season, the Pitt athletic depart-
ment made a decision they believed
would promote the Pitt football team
even further. After all, the team was
coming off a ﬁne 8-3-1 season, and
fans couldn't get enough of Pitt foot-
ball. Of course, they could go to home
games and watch the one or two away
games that were televised, but why not
make a deal where more away games
and maybe a couple of home games
could be televised?

On paper, it looked like a good
move. However. a year and a half after
a deal was made, things haven’t worked
out as expected.

In the past two seasons, all but two
,of Pitt’s football games have been
televised, creating a stir in the school’s
athletic department over whether they
are overexposed.

“We belong to two separate
packages,” said Dean Billick, Pitt’s
associate athletic director. “The CFA
[College Football Association] package
is the national one. We are allowed to

“You can turn on your television at noon and watch
football until midnight. There is just too much football

on TV.”

— Coach Fazio

play three times a year on national
television, or six times in a two-year
period.”

Pitt receives $260,000 per national
appearance. Already this season they
have played four games before national
audiences.The season opener against
Purdue was aired on ESPN , and the
USA Network aired games against
Boston College, South Carolina and -
N.C. State.

“We need the national games to
balance our budget,” Billick explained.

The second package which Pitt
belongs to is controversial. Last year
Pitt signed a one-year deal with KATZ
Sports, a company whose method of
operation is based on syndication.

KATZ signed approximately 10
eastern schools to contracts, and it
televises games‘ in each school’s
market, which include Boston (Boston
College) and Chicago__(Notre _l_)arne)

among others.

KATZ folded at the conclusion of
last season, but Pitt then signed a two-
year deal with TEN (Television Enter-
prise Network).

“We would like to have three or four
games on a year,” Billick said, “but
they have televised mostly home
games.”

“The away games just never
materialized,” said Dr. Ed Bozik-,
director of athletics at Pitt.

Pitt was hoping to have one home

game and two away games on the 

syndications. With all-the home games
being televised it has started to hurt the
attendance at Pitt Stadium. Only
34,000 attended Pitt’s homecoming
game last Saturday, which is usually a
big fan attraction.

“IfI had to make the decision over
again, I wouldn’t do it.” Bozik said.
“It has deﬁnitely hurt the gate and it

prohibits us from playing night games.
If there is some way we can get out of
it for next year, we will.”

The network schedules its games
beginning at 12:10 p.m. which takes
away the possibility of playing more
night games at Pitt Stadium. In the ﬁrst
ever night game at Pitt Stadium, 50,103
fans showed up to cheer the Panthers
to an exciting 31-30 win.

‘ ‘We are presently doing a case study
survey on night football,” Bozik said.
“We believe Pittsburgh is a good
Saturday night "town. We won’t have
to compete with anyone on a Saturday
night.

“I love night games,” said Keith
Tinsley,‘ a junior comerback on the
Panther squad. “It is a different at-
mosphere. The players and the crowd
are more intense. Those noon games
are kind of early to be playing foot-
ball.”

Billick believes the games on the
TEN could lower attendance by up to
7,000 fans per game. The attendance
of nationally televised games is not af- ‘
fected because a top-notch opponent is
usually the opposition.

‘ ‘Cable has the ability to black games
out if the game is not sold out,’ "Bozik
said. “With syndication there is no
threat of black outs. Home attendance
is still the most important source of
revenue.”

Thus far this season, Pitt had aver-
aged 41,227 per home game. Not bad,
but in a 56.000 seat stadium. a team
with Pitt’s tradition would expect it to
be higher.

“I talked to some good friends, big
Pitt fans,” Pitt Coach Foge Fazio said,
“and they said ‘Coach, noon is too ear-
1y. I can sit home and watch both the
Pitt and Penn State games and never
leave the house.’ What would you
do?”

Television doesn't even -help
recruiting anymore, Fazio argues. “At
ﬁrst, it helped us bring some people
in,” Fazio said. “But not anymore.
Now every team is on TV. You can
turn on your television at noon and
watch football until midnight. There is
just too much football on TV. The
minuses outweigh the plusses right
now. Overexposure isn’t healthy.”

As I see it

By Jim Brueckner

 Wor1d Series provides great memories

With the World Series just over the
horizon, we have been getting our an-
nual overdose of the same stories over
and over.

I am a great fan of baseball lore.
There’s nothing that I enjoy reading
more than tales of ballplayers of the
past and their exploits on the diamond.
But one thing about the stories that ap-
pear in the newspapers at World Series
time really bugs me,

You know that noise made by ﬁnger-
nails on a chalkboard? That's how I feel
whenever I pick up a- newspaper around
this time and see it ﬁlled with stories
about Don Larsen’s perfect game, Bill
Mazeroski’s home run or Mickey
Owen's dropped third strike. ‘

We hear the same stories over and
over. Why are so many of today’s
sportswriters so lazy? Why can’t they
spend a few hours digging up additional
classics from World Series history?

I recently undertook this venture and
have elected what I consider to be the
12 most underrated or overlooked
games and achievements. I had already
known some of the stories, but I also
had some pleasant surprises.

Here is my history of some of the
classics of the Fall Classic.

The most talked about World Series
game is Larsen’s perfect game. But In
1905, there was another pitching a-

. chievement that in my opinion has not

been topped in the 80 years since, not
even by Larsen’s perfecto. In that year,
New York Giant Christy MatheWSOIl.
hailed by many as the greatest pitcher
ever, hurled 27 consecutive scoreless
innings. Those three shutouts are even
more impressive when you consider
that the second game was pitched with
three days’ rest and the third with on-
ly two days’ rest.

In game two of the 1916 Series, the
Boston Red Sox beat the Brooklyn
Dodgers 2-1 in 14  George, the
Red Sox pitcher, went the distance and
limited the Dodgers tojust six hits. His
friends usually called George by his
more popular nickname, Babe. Babe
Ruth, that is.

The seventh and deciding. game of
the l924Serieshastorankasthemost
bizarre or hard-luck game in Series
history, depending on where your
loyalties lay. The New York Giants lost
to the Washington Senators when three
of the Senators’ four runs were scored
on a play that could not possibly have

Volleyball team hosts Penn State tonight,

occurred twice in the same game,_but
did. On two separate occasions, easy
ground balls were hit to Giants third
baseman Fred Lindstrom but hit a peb-
ble and bounced over his head, allow-
ing the runs to score.

The seventh game of the 1926 Series
had a classic confrontation of the young
warrior against the seasoned veteran.
With the Cardinals leading 2-1 in the
bottom of the seventh inning, Yankee
second baseman Tony Lazzeri came to
the plate with the bases loaded. Lazzeri
was one of the most feared hitters in
baseball. Alexander was one of the best
pitchers .. . about seven years before.
He was 39 years old and had already
won game six. Yet here he was in the
next game with the Series riding on his
tired old arm. Alexander turned back
the clock as he struck out Lazzeri and
held the mightly Yankees hitless in the
eighth and ninth .innings to win the
game and the Series.

The 1927 Yankees are men of
legend. But in 1928, although they
were back in the Series, they were not
the same team. They were riddled with
injuries. They would have to place their
fate entirely in the hands of Babe Ruth

- and Lou Gehrig. This pair, the most

famous one-two punch in history, did
not let their teammates down. They
sin e-handedly destroyed the Car-
dinals in four straight. Ruth hit .625
with three home runs, while Gehrig hit
.545 and added four homers in four
games.

The initial game of the 1929 Series
was the stuff that Hollywood directors

' would eat up. Manager Connie Mack

(Philadelphia A's) had told pitcher
Howard Ehmke that this would be his
ﬁnal year on the mound. When the A’s
reached the Series, Ehmke told Mack
that he had only one request before he
retired. He had never pitched in a
World Series game and he wanted just
one chance. Mack gambled and put
Ehmkein against the awesome-hitting
Cubs. The Cubs had the likes of Roger
Hornsby, Riggs Stephenson, Kiki
Oryler and Hack Hornsby, who had hit

' .380, .362, .360 and .345 respective-

ly. So  you guessed it, Ehmke beat
the Cubs 3-l. He also had 13
strikeouts, which at that time was a
World Series record.

As if that weren‘t enough, there was
more drama to come from the A’s in
the 1929 Series. In ganre four, the Orbs
were leading 8-0 going into the bottom
of the seventh inning. The A's scored
an astounding 10 runs in that inning and
beat the Cubs 10-8.

Everyone knows that the Yankees at
one time absolutely dominated
baseball. They won more World
Championships than any other team.
But do you realize just how dominating
they were during a certain four-year
period during the 30s? The Yankees
won four straight Series (1936, 1937,

‘ 1938, 1939). During that stretch, they

won 16 of 18 World Series contests.

During the 1947 Series, we saw a
classic “almost” story unfold. In game
four, the Yankees were leading the
Dodgers 2-1 in the bottom of the ninth.
Despite having control problems all
day, Yankee pitcher Floys “Bill”
Bevens was one out away from a no-
hitter. The Dodgers had two men on
as a result of walks. Cookie Lavagetto
batted for Eddie Stanky, and the stage
was set. With Bevens a mere one out
away, Lavagetto lined the second pitch
high off the right ﬁeld wall for a dou-

.ble,andbothrImnersscoredtowinthe

game for the Dodgers. Bevens never
pitched again. Nippy Jones was the
central ﬁgure. It was to be his last
rnajor-league game, but it proved to be
a most memorable one. In game four
of the 1957 Series, the Milwaukee
Braves were batting against New York
Yankees pitcher Tommy Byme. Jones
was the batter in the 10th inning. A
pitch hit Jones in the foot but went un-
noticed by the umpire. The ball
ricocheted off the grandstand, rolled
and stopped right between Jones and
the umpire as they were arguing. Jones
picked up the ball and showed the shoe
polish on the ball to the umpire, who
then reversed his decision and award-
edlonesﬁrstbase. Thatshoepolishled
to the Braves’ game—winning rally.

The 1960 World Series is best known
for Bill Mazeroski’s dramatic home
run. But what-I ﬁnd positively stagger-
ing isthefactthattheYankees, despite
losing the Series, outscored the Pirates
55-27 !

In the 1977 Series in ganre six, Reg-
gie Jackson put on the perfect power
show.» After a second-inning walk,
Jackson took tluee swings andhit three
home runs. You can't do better with
three swings than that. 7 I

. Baseball has more great stories than '

any other sport. The-World Series has
been tabbed the Fall Classic because
It has many classic memories. While
it is true that Larsen and Mazeroski will
remain heroes forever (and rightfully
so), let us not forget the others who
have lent their names and their
memories to the long and fascinating
history of the World Series.

Georgetown tomorrow at ﬁeld house

By Kelly Butt
Staff Writer

_ The Lady Panthers volleyball team
is entering the ﬁnal stretch of the
regular 1985 season. With an 18-5
slate, the team is very eager to have an
unblemished conference record. They
will get the chance to prove their play-
ing calibre this weekend. '

Pitt plays host to arch-rival Penn
State tonight at 7 p.m. in Fitzgerald
Field House. The Nittany Lions are
ranked No. 7 in the country. Coach
Collier said, “This will be a tough
match for us to prepare for. The team
already suffered a disappoinﬁng loss to
PSU earlier this month. We've worked
on several areas and should show irn—
provement. This time around, we
should be prepared for Penn State.”

Pitt was defeated in three iquick
matches at State College in early Oc-

tober. The Lady Panthers are deﬁnite-

-1y looking for a victory tonight. The

match should be an exciting spectator
match. Pitt also wants_ to split their
game with PSU. Last year, the Lady
Panthers were defeated by the Nittany
Lions in the early part of the season.
In the second game, Pitt dominated the
action and came up with the win. They
are hoping to do the same this season,
asthe end result of this game should
have a signiﬁcant effect on the national
rankings.

Pitt will take on Georgetown tomor-
row night at 7 p.m.- in the Fitzgerald
Field House. The Hoyas will bring a
much improved team to Pittsburgh.
Coach Collier stated, “Georgetown,
deﬁnitely has the potential ‘to play with
Pitt. They want to establish that they
can beat us. We want to establish that
they can’t.” _

The Hoyas are running a very close

second to the Lady Panthers in the Big
East title chase. When Pitt traveled to
Georgetown earlier this month, the
Hoyas played an extremely tough ﬂoor
game. The Lady Panthers played the
allowed maximum of ﬁve matches
before bumping off the stubborn
Hoyas. Pitt won the ﬁnal match 15-12.
Tomorrow’s game is the last Pitt will
play at home thisyear, and it should
be an intense, hard fought one.
Coach Collier "summed up the
weekend by saying, “This should be
one of the most exciting weekends of
Pitt volleyball ever." Last night the

.Lady Panthers faced Providence,

whom they defeated in the Big East ti-
tle game last year, and the USA-Japan
match ‘which followed was played
before a large crowd. Tonight the Penn
Staters will be at Pitt, and tomorrow
Georgetown will face the. Lady Pan-
thers.

r1£e'pi:2‘-News ‘-"()ctober"'18,"l985"

By Randy Miller

Pitt basketball team looks very promising

It is kind of early to make predic-
tions, but here goes: The Pitt basket-
ball team, which will open the season
inlessthanamonth, willﬁnishnoless
than second in the Big East Conference
this season. ,

Pitt has the talent to win the con-
ference outright, but it will take time
for the team to mature. Five
underclassmen should start for the Pan-
thers, who are hoping to improve on
last season's 8-8. Big East‘ record,
which was good for fourth place. Pitt
was 17-12 overall and earned a posi-
tion in the NCAA Tournament. ’

“For the ﬁrst time, four or ﬁve
teamshaveachancetowintheBigEast
tournament,” said Pitt Coach Roy
Chipman. “We’re about as excited as
we’ve ever been to start a season and
that’s mainly attributed to the fact that.
Patrick Ewing left Georgetown.”

Ewing wasn't the only big name
leaving for the NBA. St. John’s lost
All-America guard Chris Mullen; and
national champion Villanova lost three
key starters, including center ‘Ed
Pinckney.

Georgetown and Syracuse will still
be strong, but the door is open for Pitt
to step in and become a ‘national
powerhouse. Pitt, who will open the
season with a Nov. 16 exhibition game
against the Puerto Rican National Team
at the Fitzgerald Field House, will
again be led by Charles Smith.‘

The Lady Panther tennis team trav-
eled to West Virginia on Wednesday
‘for their last regular season match car-
rying a winning record under their belt,
but it was not enough to stop an
undefeated Mountaineer squad, as the
Panthers dropped the match 9-0.
The match featured a duel at the No.
1 singles spot between senior Miriam
Goltz and West Virignia’s Parade All-
’ America Patti Pritt. Goltz took the ﬁrst
set from Pritt, 6-4, and slipped in the
second, losing 6-1. .
“I was a little intimidated at ﬁrst,”
' Goltz said of playing an opponent this
highly touted. ‘ ‘But once I settled into
the match and started winning some

ward, led the team in scoring last
season while winning the conference’s
Rookie of the Year award. This season,
Smith is a legitimate All-America can-
didate, as he can do it all. For a big
man, Smith can shoot from the outside
and can dribble the ball upcourt. If
called upon, Smith could play the point
guard position.

“Smith is a lot bigger and stronger
this season,” said Chipman. “I-Ie went
from 195 lbs.to 227 1bs.and the weight
increase will help him.”

Smith, this season, «will have capable
teammates to assist him in the scoring
load with promising newcomers
Jerome Lane and Tico Cooper joining
him in the front court. -

Cooper is a junior transfer student.
who is a tough, rugged player. He can
dominatet1ieboardsandhasgoodscor-
ing ability, something Pitt desperately
needs from the center position. ‘

Keith Armstrong, who started at
center the past two seasons, is an
outstanding shot blocker and good re-
bounder, but his offensive abilities
don’t compare to those of Cooper.

Lane is the other newcomer expected
to play a big rolefor Pitt. He will be
a fan favorite as he is lightning quick
and can shoot and rebound.

Senior Darryl Shepherd isn’t about
to relinquish his small forward starting
position. Lane is one freshman who

will force Shepherd to be a role player. ~ ,

Shepherd is still the best pure shooter

- In the third set, Goltz captured a ser-
vice break and served for the match at
5-4. She then jumped to a 3-1 advan-
tage in the game, holding three match
points, but was unable to close her op-
ponent out.

“Alllhadtodo was putaﬁrst serve
in and move to the net,” Goltz
reﬂected. “I don’t know what hap-
Dened. ”

The set continued into a decisive
tiebreaker which Pritt won, 7-3.

Goltz, however, was able to take
consolation in raising the level of her
play as the Lady Panthers face their

._tougher competition. Also, she is

‘\.ecoming more optimistic regarding
;he Big East Championships.
“Knowing that I had three match
points against a Parade All—America
really makes --me think that I have a
good chance going into the Big East. ”

on the squad and will see plenty of ac-
tion, but Lane is going to be a great
one. _

“Lane’s a very versatile player and
he has great ball-handling’ skills,” ex-
plained Chipman. “Hopefully he will
make the same impact on the team that
Charlie [Srriith] did last season.”

The guard position will be solid, as
incumbents Demetreus Gore and Cur-‘
tis Aiken return as the starters. Gore,
a sophomore, became a fan favorite last
year with his exciting play that includ-
ed spectacular slam-dunks.

Aiken will run the offense with
assistance from freshman Mike Good-
son. Both are expected to get playing
time, but Aiken is the key. Aiken hasn’t
given Pitt the offense he gave to Ben-
nett High School in New York, where
he averaged 40 points per game, but
he has provided leadership.

“lf Aiken can do the job at point
guard,” Chipman said, “we’ll be in
good shape.”

It -appears all areas are solid, in_-
cluding depth. With Shepherd and
Armstrong coming off the bench, Pitt
will have experience and talent
substituting. Goodman has outstanding
ball-handling abilities; and seniors Joey
David and Matt Miklasevich will play
a role. Also, forward Marlon Ferguson
has skills that could land him starting
positions on many teams.

“It looks like it's going to be a big
year for us,” said Chipman.

Panthers .

and strong doubles play at the No; 1
and No. 2 positions.
Coach George Dieffenbach ‘felt that

this match was excellent preparation -
for the Big East and is hoping that this 7

will be the year that the Lady Panthers
will make their move.

Pitt soccer team
hosts Georgetown:

The Pitt soccer team will look to
solidify its hold on ﬁrst place inthe
Southern Division of the Big East
Conference when they host the
Georgetown Hoyas at 1:30 p.m. on
Saturday at Pitt Stadium.

Head coach Joe Luxbacher and
his Panthers are currently 8-_1-1 on
the season, with a 2-0 record in
conference play. Pitt is tied for ﬁrst
place with St. John’s.

Georgetown is 6-6, 1-2 in Big
East play. '
