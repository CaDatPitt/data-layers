Boston Conference...

I . ‘ A VYBILL MOORE ' A -
Boston University's” enormous Hayden Hall was packed to the gills

with screaming, rampaging, students spouting political rhetoric to '

anyone unable to escape" their eager grasp. _
Flyers calling for support of yvirtlually every cause conceivable littered
the Hall, the university, and Boston--if not all of New England.

No one slept. -No one ate.’ Hardly anyone smiled. They meant A

business. ..
Sounds a bit like the 1972 Democratic National Convention.
. The similarities were startling. Granted, pastel balloons and red,

_ white and blue hats didn’t crop up at the National Student Conference

Against Racism held in Boston last weekend--but political
maneuvering, strong-arm tactics, bloc voting, and the rest of what’s
disgusting about the American political process was widespread.

A tall, charismatic, cigar-smoking gentleman, affectionately dubbed
“Boss-man,” choreographed the whole event. He was the field

-marshall, the subtle coordinator of the silver arm-banded Student

Guides. 4 .

Boss-man assumed his important position at the front of the Hall from
the outset. He stood, surveying thescurrying conference-goers, trying
to anticipate trouble, and indiscreetly signalling his fellow Guides.

“A flick of his cigar ash would send 15 people rushing to the back doors
to make sure no one came in but registered conference participants. A
‘quick jerk of his denim-clad elbow would turn off the microphone
dominated by subuversive‘ forces. '" 0

BOSTON—-Nearly 2,000 students
from across the nation convened

here this past weekend for the A

National Student Conference A-
gainst Racism, formalizing the
structure of a permanent anti-rac-
ism organization and beginning
work towards a massive Boston
demonstration planned for May~17.

The Conference was called as a
show of concern and’ organizational
‘brain-storming’ session for the
student movement to combat rac-
ism across the country, with a
special focus on the Boston busing
controversy.

The Conference participants voted
approval of three major proposals
—an organized campus movement
aimed at combating racism and
segregation, the massive anti-rac-
ism demonstration planned for
Boston in the spring, and the
formation of the National Student
Coalition Against Racism to co-
ordinate the actions coming out of
the Conference. «

The campus movement formulat-

, ed in Boston during the three-day

session calledpfor “dedicated ac-
tion” ' aimed at insuring racial

equality in college admissions,‘
_ ﬁnancial aid, and academic con-

siderations.

Tutoring and counseling of stu- H"

dents affected by busing and
racism, and teach-ins. and forums
concerning the issue, were also
called for in the campus proposal.

Toke Pitt News Elections

BY RITA VITOLO

Matthew Kennedy was elected
editor-in-chief and Patti Prozzi and
BJ Dunmire ﬁnancial and advertis-
ing managers of the Pitt News in
last night’s elections for the 1975
staff.

Kennedy took the election with 20
6/7 votes over 15 1/7 cast for his
opponent, current Pitt News pro-
duction editor Gene Grabowski. T

Running for the ﬁnancial ‘mana-

gers’ position were Alan Cousar'

and Sondi Pripstein. Dunmire was
unopposed for the advertising
manager position.

During his campaign speech,
Kennedy proposed starting a
monthly Pitt News magazine inclu-
ding nonfiction writing in a maga-
zine style, providing a forum for
writers and readers not now avail-
able at the University.

“The atmosphere of the election
and the way it ‘ was conducted
indicated the Pitt’ News " has ‘put
politics behind it and is ready to

' ‘ pay more attention to the profes-
sional and educational aspects of ’

thepaper,” Kennedy said after the

» victory. 7 -
Money proved to be a key issue in

this year's campaign, with both

candidates advocating tighter edi- ,

torial communication in business

.ofﬁce affairs. Building respect in

attitudes of its editors and writers

New Allocations Criteria

Approved   by SC   Board

BY HARRIS LEVY

New guidelines for the Student.

Government (SG) Allocations
Committee were approved by the
SG Board in a special meeting
yesterday. '

The new guidelines, formulated
by previous SG Board and Alloca-
tions Committee members,

cause of her difficulty.

Since her tuition payment for this winter term was due
last December 10, Darlene Hayes has had a running battle
with the University’s Office of Student Accounts.

Her invoice, she thought, had been paid as usual with a
grant by the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation(BVR), but
almost every week this term she’s received either a new
invoice or a notice warning her of academic cancellation!

Hayes went to the Student Accounts office, explained her
problem, and was assured that BVR would be properly
billed for the tuition. Yet she continued to receivepthe
regular notices, and last week her registration was
officially cancelled. -

Since the University has successfully billed BVR for her

tuition in the past, she suspected‘ it was Pitt’s new
computerized billing system that was to blame for the
oversight, but University officials said computers were not

 

Even so, Hayes contended, by streamlining its billing
process, Pitt has become more impersonal than ever,
alienating many students like herself.

“If a problem like this arises,” she said, “the're’s no one
to talk to. Previously, I could go to someone in the‘ Student
Accounts department and have it cleared up--person to
person.”

While the University has indeed found it financially
necessary to streamline its billing procedure and cut a few
personalized frills, it has also institutionalized a friend for
the victim-student—the office of the Ombudsman.

Bitt’s Ombudsman is Leland Deck. He is the last resort
for students who cannot get satisfaction from the Office of
Student Accounts. He has no real authority, just a lot of

' knowledge of how the system works, and he’ll personally
, accompany a.student to the financial offices to clear up a a

stricter than earlier regulations,
according to Committee carry-over
member Pat Cooper. “The reasons

are inﬂation and tight money.

We’re going to gear funding this
year to things that give students a
visible return for their money,” she
added.

problem. And best of all, he has resolved more than 80%

“I’m here for the lack of humanism in this bureaucracy,”
said Deck. ‘‘In most cases, students don't present‘ their‘
problemsvery well to the Student Accounting OffiCe..S0 I /

In the case of Darlene Hayes, Deck suggested she make
an appointment to see him as soon as possible an_d

“What usually happens is the student receives notice of his -
ﬁnancial aid and believes the University has received the
same kind of notice about the aid. But unless the student_
presents proof of the loan or grant, he is billed for all costs

This may be Hayes’ problem. Whether it is or isn't-
though, she, and other students with similar problems,_ are

editor in the Pitt News’ annual
budget dealing with Student . Gov-
ernment’s Allocations Committee.
“‘We‘ have to recognize Student 
Government’s need and demands; 
and reach a compromise which best f
approaches the aims of all par- 
ties,” Kennedy said. “Butthere 'is_ _.
no way we can compromise: the
editorial independence of the. pa- ' ’

Approved by SG Board

(Continued from Page 1)

According to Cooper, a new
provision concerning fund-raising
and dues compensates for the
guidelines’ strictness. “Any dues
and fund-raising projects not gen-
erated by money from the activities
fee won’t be under Allocations
Committee jurisdiction,” Cooper

‘ said.

SG President Larry Platt said,
‘‘All this does is legitimize policies
used in, the past.” A provision
which guarantees all recognized
student organizations funds for
bffice supplies, membership
drives, general mailing expenses,
and duplicating expenses is impor-
tant, according to Platt.

“The guidelines are written in an
absolute sense, but they can be
waived. For instance, if -it would
affect a signiﬁcant number of Pitt
students,” Platt said. .

The Board approved Lynne Cron-
feld as the seventh Allocations
Committee member to replace
Jerry Leff, who resigned. ,

SG Board member Steve Tarnock
voiced satisfaction with the new
regulations. “The guidelines are a
lot better because they don’t give
groups any leeway,” Tamock said.
“They’re more deﬁnite thaniin the
past.”

  Perspective

though the new rules were an
improvement but took issue with a
provision in the Allocations Com-
mittee bylaws which gives the Vice
Chancellor of Student Affairs ﬁnal
veto power over all SG allocations.
“My objections are based on the
fact that student money should be
controlled by students,” said Sat-
inoff, who said the provision would

‘be investigated.‘

A regulation concerning non-uni-
versity accounts was among the 25
new regulations. It states that
“Any non-university account must
be reported to the Student Gov-

'ernment and the Allocations Com-
mittee.”

Board member Mary Schwarz
said, “We just want to know where

people have money other than what’

they were allocated.” .
Assistant Director of Student Af
fairs Lory Seman said the provis-
ion was for activities of debatable
value. “In those cases, if you have
money elsewhere we suggest you

use that,” she said.

After the Board approved the
guidelines, Student Activities and
Allocations Committee officials met
with business managers from stu-
dent organizations.- “The meeting
was to explain new and old
procedures and to give them an
overview,” Cooper said. I

Participants in the Conference
were urged to return to their
campuses and begin organization
of local coalitions aimed at carrying
out the Conference goals. I

The-Conference also approved the
proposal for a May 17 march in’

1“-.Boston to show support for de-

segregation of schools. “On May
17, 1954, the Supreme Court ruled
that ‘separate schdols are inher-
ently unequal.’ That was nearly 21
years, ago.‘ Today, the Boston
schools are still segregated...The
Boston Branch of the NAACP has
called for a massive, peaceful and
— legal march in Boston on May 17
for desegregat'ion..'.The National
Student Conference Against Rac-
ism supports this national march,”
the Conference proposal said.
Organizers said they hoped to
attract approximately 20,000
marchers for the May demonstra-
tion.

 

it was decided to hold a second
Conference during Fall 1975 to
review the work of NSCAR and
plan further actions.

Further proposals to endorse and

support various anti-racism move-
ments in Boston and across the
nation were also approved by the
Student Conference.

Once again the Chancellor has
made available to the students and
faculty of the College of Arts and
Sciences twelve undergraduate
teaching fellowships for the Fall
Term, 1975-76. These awards are
worth $500 each. In addition, the
department in which the. particular
course is taught may choose to
award academic credits to the
teaching fellow, presumably
through independent study. Appli-
cations for these awards should be
sent to Dean Robert Marshall in’
917 Cathedral of Learning by
March 3, 1975. Announcement of
the awards, as ‘granted by an
appointment committee, will be
made on March 10, 1975.

fellow in the course, and specifying
how the fellow is to be used as a
way of inﬂuencing the course’s
purposes or the students’ experi-
ence or the faculty’s own develop-

2. The student should submit a
two or three-page statement
explaining both what his or her
purpose, in terms or personal
development, is in applying for the
fellowship and what the intended
effect on the course is.

3. One letter of recommendation
of the student's qualifications for

serving as a teaching fellow should '

be submitted by a member of the

- Faculty of Arts and Sciences other

than the faculty sponsor.

Perhaps the major accomplishment of the Conference was the
mobilization of a signiﬁcant number of students around a vital national
issue. This is the first showing of such strong support among students
ma long time, and it’s a good sign. We can’t go back to the 60’s,
ut .neither can we remain stagnant.
Actually, it was not the purpose of the Conference to plot speciﬁc
methods of combatting racism. That will be the job of the local
rganizationsi which will hopefully sprout from the feeling of unity

The effects of racism here are

underground. The violence is psychological, but it’s just as damaging.
till, the impetus isn't there to stir those not directly concerned.
None of this should deter those students attending the conference

moven1er1t.' That movement succeeded mostly through determination
and conviction, not through traditional organization, and it managed to
set a political mood which enlightened the nation. No reason it can’t be

sciences was dropped from the
curriculum, or even denied credit
on the basis that is conceivably
could lead to the destruction of
mankind (which is a far more
realistic view) people would be up
in ' arms. Yet this actually has
happened to ROTC courses,
because of a negative attitude
which has been implanted in our
minds by the press against, quote,
‘ ‘militarism.’ ’ A
War is an ugly fact. We cannot
evade its presence by _placing
ourselves in an artificial, sterile,
idealistic world. None of us wish for
it -- but in the event it breaks, we
have to be prepared to defend our
values, and perhaps our very

existence. ROTC cadets are not

“trained to kill,” as some militant
arm-waving factions would lead us
to believe. "They are trained in
leadership -- a much-needed asset
in these apathetic times.

Let’s not forget, too, that Pitt is
receiving State funds and many
research funds here receive Feder-
al grants. Are we to‘bite the hand
that feeds us?

Some would like us to believe that
our society is totally wrong (then
why are they living here?). Are
those that oppose ROTC afraid to
see a little good in our govern-
ment? In the rush to criticize
sometimes we forget about the
privileges we’re about to lose.

Yes, we do have, by the
Constitution and Bill of Rights,_ the
privilege to criticize. But I think it
lacks sense to usurp the system by

.'which we are fed. It seems the

faculty wants to have its cake and
eat it, too.

Are we Americans? Think about
it. I invite comment.

  ROTC:

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

Whenever the military is involved
in an issue, emotionalism seems to
pervade; and the current contro-

'versy. over the accreditation of

ROTC courses at Pitt is no
exception. Proponents of credit
claim that it is an abridgement of

academic freedom to deny credit,

that ROTC courses take just as
much time and effort as other
university courses.

The opposition charges that ROTC
students get enough monetary
beneﬁts to make up for the loss of
credits. Further, they claim that
courses which “teach people how
to kill” do not belong on a
university campus. Both of these
positions warrant a reexamination.

The military wants people with a
broad based liberal arts back-
ground in order to avoid the
creation of a force specialized only
in killing. This is sufficient
justification for the existence of
ROTC. The dilemma, then, is how
to attach ROTC to the campus
without destroying the concept of a
“liberal arts’? ’ education.

It is clear the majority of ROTC
students do not receive a substan-
tial amount of salary aid. This is
extended only to upperclassmen,
and even then, is not always
enough to meet the individual’s
ﬁnancial needs. Therefore, some
motivation for students to stay in
ROTC is needed.

‘ Credit from.the College of Arts
and Sciences, however is not the
Military science is an
exact technical skill which can be
used only by those in or connected
with the military. Courses on the
development of the military and its
effect on American society are
available from the history and
political science departments.

Courses in military tactics,
weapons, military leadership, drill-
ing, etc., do not belong in a liberal
arts curriculum for the same reason
that an advanced course in
chemical engineering does not.

The logical solution, then, is to
either create a_ separate school of
military science or reevaluate the
military’s obligation to students
enrolled in ROTC.

The creation of a separate school
of military science is unfeasable at
this time for several reasons. First,
the University cannot afford to fund
a major new division, especially
when so many other departments
are crying for money. Also, Pitt is
lacking in" several areas which
would better serve the demands of
the students, business and journa-

lism, for example.

Funding of a school of military
science by the military would
create a whole new set of problems.
For example who would have
jurisdiction over the instructors,
the University or the military?
Who would choose the department
head? And could a military
instructor be granted tenure in the
University or not?

Finally, the creation of a school of
military science within the Univer- ‘
sity could create a micro “West
Point,” in that students would be
exposed mostly to military struc-
tures and ideas, which is just what
the military wants to avoid.

Separate or Equal?

So the onus is on the military to
find some way to adequately
compensate ROTC students for
their time and effort. If the military
wants officers with a liberal arts
background, it should be willing to
pay them, and not at the expense of
the university involved.

Aid should be offered all ROTC
students, either. in the form of
scholarships or direct salary. In
fulﬁllment of their obligations for
this aid, ROTC students would
attend non-accredited courses.
This situation is similar to holding
down a part time job while
attending classes.

The difference between this
situation and the one which exists
now is a matter of degree. Aid to
ROTC students should be greater
and more complete than it is now.
Giving credit for ROTC courses is
only a halfway measure, and an
injustice to both the University and
ROTC students. ‘

"A Vote of Praise

To Lorry Seman

Dear Editor, I t
It was 7:30, Wednesday eve,

‘when the ﬁrst regular Student

Government Board meeting com-
menced. At 7:35, the President’s
report was ‘halted, in order that
Lorry Seman could say a few
words. These words crested a
silent mood ‘amongst the Board
members, one of sadness and
regret. “Effective March 1, I will
be resigning and leaving the
University.” .
With respect to our position as
Board members, we have worked
‘with Lorry for only one month. Yet
in this short time, Lorry has come
to be very special to all of us. Only
ﬁve feet tall, our image of her has
rapidly become a dynamic one.
Whenever we need assistance,
whether it be a personal matter or
an interpretation of policy, Lorry
has been able to help. She has
guided us, watched us make
mistakes and aided us in under-
standing and correcting those
mistakes.

The Student Government Board
unanimously votes that Lorry

 

Seman is a beautiful person, and
we hate to see her go. Best of luck
to her always, and Lorry, we love
you. t .

‘Pitt Organizations

Suffer’ For Size L

Editor:

I address my comments to the
Committee on Student Organiza-
tions (CSO):

I was upset to read in the January
31 issue of the Pitt News that the
CS0 voted to recommend to
Student Government Board (SGB)
to withdraw recognition from 32
Pitt sponsored organizations. I was
further disturbed to read that CSO
claims to have successfully con-
tacted (in person, yet) these
organizations after the January 11
deadline for filing proof of
membership.

The Association of Undergradu-
ates in Education [AUE] was never
contacted by CSO either before or
after that deadline. The AUE
received not letter explaining the
situation. Losing recognition by the
SGB would be detrimental to all of

 Pitt’s undergraduates in education.

 

No recognition would result in no
allocations which ‘would prevent
the newly opened Student Advising
Center [2717 CL] from operating
and serving undergraduates in-

terested in the School of Educa- .

-tion’s programs.

I feel it is unfair not only to the
AUE, but to the undergraduates in
the School of Ed., to have
recognition withdrawn because of
the CSO’s failure to contact the

‘AUE. Furthermore, I’ ﬁnd it
difficult to believe that 32 separate,
unrelated organizations would fail
to file proof of membership had
they been “successfully con-
tacted" by the CSO. Reading the
list of organizations in danger is
reading the list of 'Pitt’s small
member organizations. CSO
wouldn’t be picking on us because
-of our size, would it??

{Continued from Page I)

But Boss-man, as manipulative as
he seemed, was the savior of sorts
for the weekend.

When a faction of about 30 Maoist
politicos scooped up the ﬂoor
microphone and demanded three
10-m-inute extensions of their
5-minute speaking time, it was
Boss-man who averted a near-riot.

Late Saturday evening. The 1,500
perspiring youths were exhausted
from their bus, car, or plane-trips
ﬁoni Pittsburgh, Houston, LA, and
God-only-knows-where. People
were beginning to express concern
at the lessening of the air of
cooperation which had begun the
conference.

The all-day workshops had just
ended, and almost everyone was

' intently excited about telling the

masses what they had decided. It
was, in the strongest sense of the
word, potentially explosive.

“We DEMAND the right to
speak. We are sick of this fucking

from the balcony--“SIT DOWN!
SIT DOWN!

She didn’t sit down. She didn’t
even consider it. Instead, her 30
comrades crawled out of their holes
and circled the mike. They ignored
the “SIT DOWN” cheers.

This was where Boss-man stepped
in, or rather motioned in. He
pointed to the man controlling the
microphone and, ever so subtly,
turned up his thumb. The
microphones immediately switched
on.

“This Conference is" being man-
ipulated by Trotskyite Socialists--
(supposedly the ultimate insult to a
leftist)--and we are sick of it. I
want to tell you people in this room
you are being tricked, you are
being duped. You think you are
combating racism, but you are
actually working for the same
forces that cause it,” a black man
screamed, shattering more than a
few eardrums.

  -weanesaigpebiuary:9,’ 1375-f—THE Pl'I’.T Ews, Pa‘

Boston Conference: Not All Was Perfect  

He toned down slightly once he
realized the mike was on. “I’m not

gonna be organized by no fuckin"

white brother,” the vehement
anti—racist proclaimed.

Similar demands erupted from the
group spokesperson for about 30
minutes, including one that the
Conference denounce busing. The
latter demand brought out a second
rallying-cry from the insulted
majority--“KEEP THE BUSES
ROLLING. STOP THE RACIST
DRIVE.”

But the balloons never came, and
the Maoists left. “All progressive
people interested in REALLY
combating racism meet us outside
and we’ll start a real Student
Conference Against Racism,” one
of the vocal members roared. They
left. Two, maybe three, others
followed. That was out of the way.

Afterwards, many old-line leftists
said such demonstrations were
mandatory. “Hell, someone used

to pull this crap /at every anti-war
rally ever held. All we can do is try
to stop violence. I’m just glad they
left,” someone said outside the
Hall. '

It was downright boring from then
on--that is, until the next day.

Sunday it was the Spartacus
Youth League's turn. They

‘ demanded the Conference adjourn,

happily board the waiting buses
they had lined up, and roll over to
the crisis-ridden South Boston to
picket the home of some Boston
School Board_director.

Not a bad idea, but upwards of

2000 Southies, intent on segrega-_

tion, were already waiting to crack
some sense into their skulls if they
even neared South Boston.

Similar shouting, cheering, de-
manding, cursing, and all the rest
occurring the night before, began.
Disunity was again a threat, but
Boss-man kept his cool and averted
any ugly incidents. ,

When the time to board the buses

   
    
    
  
  
   
 
   
   
   
   
  

came, with no decision still reached-
by the Conference, the word c_am'e'._’
that Boston Police weren’t about to’ I
let them go -in spite of themselves. .

It seems the cops weren’t up "for, ~-
watching any skullbusting or blood ’
mopping for two days, so they I
pulled 15 police cars into a circle
surrounding the buses and waited. ,

To insure calm, three police. .
lieutenants came into the Hall, the‘
first sighted all weekend, just to’ ’-

The Conference near-unanimous-- ;
ly voted down the picketing idea.‘ .

No one went to South Boston, 3
unless they walked. " .

6.6 per cent, with white collar
unemployment well below that.

The demand for steel, coal and
other raw materials, and locally
produced capital goods remains
high, and the retail trade picture
here is among the brightest in the
country.

‘‘In comparison with the rest of
the state and the nation, Pittsburgh
remains a sturdy beacon in these
hard times,” said Charles J.
Hamilton, district manager of the
Bureau of Employment Security
(BES).

A Pitt News survey of local
businesses conﬁrmed that while
some have fewer entry level
positions open to liberal arts
graduates than last year, most
ﬁrms indicated their needs are
nearly the same.

Despite the healthy retail scene,
Kau£mann’s cited an abundance of
management trainees and eco-
nomic uncertainty in explaining the

resumes till April. It was hiring at
this time _last year.

Pittsburgh National Bank pointed
to the effect of‘ falling interest rates
on its management training pro-
gram whichhas been cut back from
last year’s high.

sales where the job market

V continues very active, particularly

in the insurance industry. When
contacted, divisional sales manager
Raul Aguilar of IDS, Inc., extended
an eager invitation to anyone
interested in insurance and securi-
ties sales. He said his company’s

needs are greater than last year‘

and predicted ﬁrst year earnings of
$8000 to $30,000.

Other sales positions are more
exclusive. PPG, for example, said
% of its sales force is composed of
engineers and chemists with the
remainder usually having business
related ‘degrees or industrial sales
experience.

Of course, few MBAs or engineers
are expected to get shut out of jobs
this year. Liberal arts majors

without any vocational training in

such ﬁelds as accounting, compu-
ter work or writing, and without
any experience in business or social
service face slim pickings if they
pass over sales and civil service
openings. ’

All liberal arts candidates seeking
positions in business will be
competing against.business majors
from other universities for the
limited. number of slots open to
them. Yet according to the hiring
projections of the ﬁrms surveyed,

many will compete successfully.

Nevertheless, some companies
are bypassing Pitt on their
recruiting drives because there is
no undergraduate business major
offered here. Companies like
Westinghouse Electric, though not
out recruiting liberal arts people,
are taking applications. When
administrative, marketing and per-
sonnel openings develop, they may
be filled by an impressive
candidate without a business
degree.

    

Under the affirmative action
banner, some major corporations
like US Steel are actively recruiting
those who'opted‘ for the liberal
education only at predominantly
black and women’s colleges. While
the white male CAS graduate may
feel snubbed because he has to
take the initiative to interview‘ with
these ﬁrms, it is still true that too

Gomic Book Dan ventian Brings
Zap! Pow! and Slam! to Pitt

BY YAIER LEHRER
Comic books, that escapist med-
ium that has caused its share of

wxstrife between parent and child,

had its heyday in Pittsburgh when
pilgrims, otherwise known as
Comic Fans, made the trek to
Pittcon ’75 --Pittsburgh’s comic
fans’ convention -- this past week-
end. A
The Fans were treated to a
weekend of buying and selling,
speakers from the comic industry,
along with Buck Rogers and Flash
Gordon flicks. Approximately $13-~
14 thousand exchanged hands at
Pittcon ’75 as fans eagerly gobbled
up hordes of Spiderman, Super-
man, Conan, Swamp Tliing, Fan-
tastic Four, and countless others.
Many of the fans are looked upon

‘ with disdain for such “childish”

things, but contemporary literature
students had better start brushing
up on their Batman, because comic
books have most deﬁnitely arrived
as a valid form of art and literature.

“There is no question that comics
have had a great impact on the

world,” said Len Wein, editor-in- ’

chief of Marvel Comics. “Colleges
are offering courses in comics while
the Electric Company has begun

publishing Spidey Stories to teach ,

kids how to read. Not only that, but
the ‘Louvre has a special room
devoted to comic book art.” '

Wein, although seeing the impact
and value comic books have, has no
altruistic motives for writing comic
books. He just does it because he
loves it.

‘Working with comics is not just a
job to me,” says Wein. “It’s my
life.” '

These may seem like strange
words coming from a man of Len’s

 years (he’s at least over 20) but

they have been echoed by most

people ever associated with the

comic book industry.

Most of the writers now classiﬁed
as the New Breed of comic book
writers started out as fans. Len
Wein used to draw comic books
while his friend Mary Wolfman,
now editor of the Marvel black and
white line, wrote the stories. The
stories weren’t bad but the artwork
just didn’t make it. Len, who would
have then done anything to break
into comic books, became a writer,
and is now one of the best in the
business.

Jim Shooter, writer of the Super-
man series, started out in comic
books when he was only thirteen
years old.

“I was reading a comic book one
day and decided that I could write
better than that,” Shooter said.
“So I sat down and wrote a book
and did all the pictures and sent it
in to DC comics. A little while later,
I got a letter from the editor telling
me that they would give\ me $200
for the story and that I should write
"some more stories for them, and
I’ve been doing it ever since.”

This New Breed of writers and
artists have taken the comic book
and turned it into a true art form.
At times they have even gotten too
good for their‘own good.

“It’s really strange, but great
artists like Jim Steranko and Neal
Adams just don’t sell,” says Wein.
“Their artwork is over the heads of
the average reader. Barry Smith’s
Conan the Barbarian was cancelled

for a week and a half, but when .

someone else took over sales
jumped up considerably.”

So while the art form is part of the
comic book industry, the art is
necessarily compromised by the
fact that comic books are also a
business and when the art fails, the

p ‘business must takeover. If a book

is artistically meritorious but
doesn’t sell well, it will out of
necessity be cancelled, while a less
artistic book that sells well will be
kept on.

The trick is to come up with a book
that is artistically well done and is
also a good business investment,
Len Wein’s Swamp Thing being a
perfect example. Wein’s stories,
along with Bernie Wrightson’s art,
have combined to bring about one
of the most successful comics in the
business. It sells well, and it is also
one of the best comics on the racks
today. In the recent ACBA awards
[comics’ equivalent of the Academy
Awards], Wrightson won the award
for Best Penciller, while Swamp
Thing won as Best Continuing
Feature. _

Selling the comic book is‘ the
ultimate desire of those in the
comic book industry. Just because
something doesn’t sell doesn’t
mean it isn’t any good, but the
company can’t affort to pay for the
sereis. The only exception to this is

the Denny “O’Neil,-Neal Adams‘

version of Green Lantern and
Green Arrow.

In the Green-Lantern-Green-Ar- “
row series, Adams and O’Neil
covered social issues from pollution
to a controversial series on drugs, I
in which the ward of Green Arrow
is found to be a heroin addict.

“0’NeilI and Adams had a deﬁn-
ite statement to make in ‘ their
comics,’? says Wein, “DC was
going in the hole on the series, but
they tried to keep it alive, and if the
drug series stopped any one kid

from getting into hard drugs, then ‘

the whole thing was worth it.”

While the DC comics "line allowed
the GL-GA series to go on and did
not stiﬂe the creative instincts of
Adams and O’Neil], Jim Shooter,
who authors Superman, has had a
totally different experience."

“Every story I write has to follow
a certain formula or it won’t be
published,” says Shooter. “I have
to have one Steve ‘Lombard prank,
A Clark Kent identity thing, and it
has to have plenty of Superman’
action. It’s really an accomplish-
ment when I can get away with a
small experiment, in one of my_

u
- . . : n 9 a

Wein, who is an editor, has a
totally different viewpoint when
working with the writers at Marvel
comics.

“I don’t want to influence my
people,” he says. ‘‘I figure that if a
writer is working for us, he’s a
professional and deserves his crea-
tive freedom.”

“I like the Marvel system,”
Shooter says. “It’s the only place
you can get art. At DC, writing is
more a craft or knack than any sort
of art.”

Shooter is right that art has in the
past been far from the DC scheme
of things, but they have started to
make some advancement in the
comic book industry- with such
books as Swamp Thing, The Sha-
dow, Tarzan, Rima, and whole new
lines of comics that promises to be
a whole new look for the DC
comics.

“The problem with DC,” Shooter
says, “is that they work from an
issue to issue basis and only work
on selling one issue at one time.
While we can only write one story
per issue, Marvel, with its religious
following can afford to draw a story

out over a few issues and therefore
get better character development
in their stories.”

“I Ieamed to read from comic
books,” he said. “When you’re the
kid that everyone picks on .at
school, comic books are a great
escape, as well as for any other kid.
You see a lot of kids running‘
around with a towel tied around
their neck as a ‘cape and pretending
that they’re Superman.”

Shooter writes basically for kids,
but the escapist medium exist for
anyone wanting to escape from the

rat race of everyday life. For $.25 ._

(it used to be ten) a person can ﬂy
with Superman, swing through the
city of New York with Spiderman,
or leap like the Incredible Hulk.

For $.25, a person can’t even
escape downtown on a bus. But for
those same $.25, a person can
escape to a whole new world, one
where he doesn’t have to. worry
about Gerald Ford’s IQ, an overdue
mortgage payment, or the end of
the world.

It’s a brave new ‘world, where
everyone canbelong.

Decreased funding, particularly at
the federal level, is hurting science
and social service agencies, but
limited employment opportunities
for the inexperienced do exist. As
in any field, regardless how

discouraging the prospects, the
interested candidate should apply
because openings develop sud-
denly and are often filled without
publicity from the pool of available
applicants.

Professional counselors strongly
recommend that the liberal arts job
seeker explore civil service possi-
bilities and take all the relevant

tests. The federal government is
the nation's largest single employ-
er, and jobs in many categories can
also be found at state, city and
county levels.

For federal or state employment,
the candidate often must be willing
to relocate, although that require-
ment is not uncommon in private
industry.

Underclassmen who seek summer
work are advised to make their
choice according to their career
plans. One source available for
examination at the placement
center is the “College Placement
Annual l975” which specifies
those employers of the over 1400 it
lists who offer summer positions.

The following advice from two
independently interviewed person-
nel officials was offered to
underclassmen enrolled in aca-
demic studies programs: “Get out
of liberal arts.” However, as BES
spokesman Michael Acquaviva
pointed out, just a few years ago
the great demand was for the
generalists and engineers were
walking the streets.

For those who see graduate
school as a worthwhile step in
career preparation, one counselor
had this to say: “First, evaluate the
market in your area of interest. If
it’s soft in that field, as in teaching,
more schooling may just compound
your problem.”

The services offered by the
Bureau of Employment Security
make it one of the most valuable
agencies serving the job hunter.
Graduates who will be returning or
moving to locations outside of the
city or the state can get current
information on job availability
around the country at the employ-
ment office. -

At last count, there were 1700 Job
Bank listings in the four-county

area. Lawrence J. Schuster, mana- E

ger of the professional/clerical/
sales ofﬁce of the Pittsburgh
bureau,,noted he has more jobs
than any private agency and
there’s no fee. Employment coun-
seling is backed up by vocational
guidance counseling, and a variety

of tools are employed to assist the

applicant 0 in reaching a career
decision or ﬁnding a job or both.

The bottom line on employment
for the liberal arts major? There are
jobs, but be prepared to work - to
really work - for them, to shelve
your salary requirements and to
put your “future” into a holding
pattern if necessary to get a foot in
the door. For while colleges have
been pushing grades upward and
failing out fewer students, that last
course shows no mercy.

Mmfgh. Symphony Presents
Well-Rounded Concerts,

BY JIM OPPENHEIMER
The weekend of Feb. 14, 15 and
16, the Pittsburgh Symphony Or-
chestra, under the direction of new

* assistant conductor Thomas Mich-

alak, presented an interesting con-
cert. The range of_ works being
performed was about as diverse as
one could have wished.

The program began with Rossini’s
Overture to La Gazza Ladra, one of

.f‘}_better overtures of Rossini, and

a- spirited work for beginning a

concert.

' The second work on the program
was The Unanswered Question, by
Charles Ives. This is a fascinating
work for strings, trumpet and flute

'quartet. The strings, which play

very conventionally in a steady
tempo, symbolize the passage of
time, life, or what you will; a solo
trumpet, playing notes in extreme
dissonance to the strings, asks the

question of “why we exist”; and a .

quartet of reeds (ﬂutes, in this
case, although Ives didn’t seem to
care too much what instruments

yﬁﬁere used) interjects a “search-

A.

mfg” motif, becoming more and
more insistent as the piece nears its
conclusion. This portrays the ef-
forts of humankind to answer the
riddle of our own existence. I found
the work extremely effective.

The ﬁnal work in the first half of
the concert was the Concerto No.
24 in C Minor [K. 491] by. Wolfgang

 The piano soloist was
1 Alexis Weissenberg in this melo-
dious three-movement work. Un-
like most of Mozart's concertos,

V this work uses a fairly extensive

 

 

orchestra, and as a result, the
orchestra plays an important role.
In comparison to his other concer-
tos for piano, this is like a
symphony with a very important
piano‘ part. It is‘ an interesting
 rk. The soloist gave a good

“-performance, undaunted by pas-
sages calling for considerable tech-
nique. The playing was clear.

After the intermission, the concert
continued with Debussy’s Three
Nocturnes, subtitled “Clouds,”

' “Festivals,” and “Sirens.” These
three movements are devised to
portray general ideas I concerning

. their titles. It is quite easy to
imagine a huge cumulus cloud
passing over, in the middle of

“Clouds,” and in one section of
“Festivals,” there is an obvious
allusion to a festive procession. We
can hear the crowd slowly ap-
proaching, and then gradually re-
ceding into the distance again.

“Sirens” is a musical description
of the female creatures of Greek
mythology which sat on rocks and
sang songs which drove sailors
mad with desire, luring them to
shipwreck and death. The orches-
tra was augmented by the women’s
voices of the Mendelsohn Choir.
The singing was dreadful, and
completely ruined the movement. I
knew the Mendelsohn Choir -was
amateurish, but here, I could not
believe my ears.

The ﬁnal work of the concert was
La Valse, by Maurice Ravel. This is
a tribute to the Viennese waltzes of
Johann Strauss. It begins with the
three-beat rhythm of the waltz, but
the music is very fragmented, and
it takes a little while before the real
waltz rhythm becomes clear. It is as-
if the waltz was materializing out of
a fog. As the work progresses, the
waltzes take on the sweeping,
grand scale of the Viennese ball-
room. One could imagine the swirl
of long skirts, the rhythmic move-
ments of the dancing couples. A
brilliant piece, ending this concert
on a joyful, exhilerated tone.

The next concert will be March 7,
8 and 9, conducted by Andre
Previn, featuring Berlios’ Overture
to Beatrice and Benedict, Rach-
maninoff’s Symphony No. 2, and
yet another piano concerto by
Mozart. Alicia de Larrocha will be
piano soloist.

A Couple of Swells is a
smash, the best
showcase this season for two of
Pittsburgh’s most talented per-
formers. The familiar [but not
overpopularized] showtunes were
brought off in a smooth stylish

fashion.

The show’s costars Lenora Ne-

energies to combine blissful

better.

It might seem inevitable to draw
comparisons between the two

nicely avoided; each performer has
her own forte.

Nemetz sets the pace as singer-
dancer-comedienne. She exploded

An Urge for Wosleful Reading

BY TOM WASELESKI

I Maigret Goes Home

by Georges Simenon I
Penguin Books, paper, 139 pp.,
$1.25

Of all the books I've read so far in
this young term, Maigret Goes
Home has undoubtedly been the
biggest waste of time (excluding
texts, of course). It could’ve been
worse, though, since a hundred
and thirty-nine pages isn’t all that
much reading. But out of journalis-
tic honesty, a guilty conscience,
and sincerity to my editor, I stuck it
out to the very last paragraph.
What attracted me to the book
were the “sucker lines” on the
back cover. Sucker lines are the

, ‘words a publisher uses to sell a .

book--and if you fall for them
you’re a sucker. Like me. The
hook: “It was murder--murder with
six suspects. But none of them
could ever be punished. Legally.”

about him, “He has published over
180 novels in his own name.” And
so I thought:either this guy is about
five hundred years old or he writes
crap. .

He doesn’t write crap, he master
it with a ﬂair.

The story is a run-of-the-mill
mystery, and though I don’t par-
ticularly take to mysteries I thought
this novel would be a change of
pace from the more introspective
things I’ve been reviewing. After
all, the guy’s been published in
thirty-two languages. He’s got to
be good.

About thirty pages into the story I
realize I've come across every
cliche in the book. That’s why this
author’s in thirty-two languages
--he’s easy to translate.

The main character, the French
inspector Maigret, is no Sherlock
Holmes, and as you’ve gathered, I
don’t regard author Simenon as an
Arthur Conan Doyle. Maigret
doesn’t even devise a plan to reveal
the culprit; one of the other
mediocre characters does.

The only grounds for suspecting
anyone lies in their personal gain
from the countess’ will.‘ Thus we

have a not so unique line-up: the‘

countess’ son, her official secretary
[unofficial lover], the estate’s chief
steward and his son, the woman’s
doctor, and her priest.

Author Simenon must be given A

credit for not suspecting the coun-
tess’ late husband, for he also

could’ve gained by her death. But .

he’s been dead for years and
Simenon was very perceptive to
notice that. Bravo.

‘The only worthwhile part of the
story is its climax, which reads like
something out of Edgar Allen Poe.
The countess’ son has invited his
fellow-suspects to a_ late dinner,
and with everyone seated at a
round table, he places a revolver in

the center and prophesies that the ,

real murderer will be dead by
midnight. A war of nerves ensues.

I have to tell you the end of the
story because this book is really
trash and I wouldn’t want any of
you mystery lovers to blow money
on it. Midnight comes and the
steward’s son picks up the revol-
ver. and blasts the countess’ son
through the chest a few times, then
makes for the window. But he’s not
quick enough, and gets tripped by
the dead man who now jumpsup
and says ha-ha I fooled you, they
were only blanks and you were my
mother’s murderer because you got
so nervous. He then turns to
Inspector Maigret and says he
wants the cop’s day’s pay and then
turns to the author and says
Maigret had no place in the whole
damn book and how he should have
been the main character--title and
all.

It’s never stated by the Inspector
or anyone else why the murderer
can’t be punished legally, but it’s
repeated over and over--I’ guess to
stress the irony of the situation, for
which I find no_ base. As if we
had nothing better to read.

   
   

‘Who said you could steal

my wife's underwear?’

BY DOUG GEBHARD

This piece is dedicated to all my friends who enioyed my column on
rock n’ roll...so please excuse the indulging in friendly matters.

This may be one of the few times I may directly attack some of the Pitt
News readers but as you will see, it is unavoidable. I’m going to be -
talking on the Led Zepplin show and the re-release of Bustin’ Out by
Pure Prairie League. If you have a weak stomach or would like to
become outraged you’ve got your choices of putting this down now or
heading for the Penthouse calender and the I/{leenex box...now.

I’m of the ﬁrm conviction that Led Zepplin is washed up. Anyone who
thinks that their performance was anywhere above fuckin’ lousy is
fuckin’ nuts. Facts: Robert Plant’s voice was inaudible and had traces
of really serious throat problems, Jimmy Page repeated licks and
missed runs throughout the show, John Paul Jones cannot play the
electric piano-—he has no feel for rhythm, Bonham’s drums were
poorly miked and last but not least “the P.A. system ate it.” It was
billed as the biggest and best in the nation. What a joke. The Dead’s
was ‘ten times that size and twenty times better. The system that
toured with CSN & Y this summer was better...and smaller. If you
thought that Zepplin’s sounded good, I think you’re probably out to
nch

   

The crowd...well kids what can I say? Really, I’d give my right
testicle for a good crowd at the Arena_these days. They are as few and
far between as a cheap whore. One down and one to go.

Pure Prairie~League have been around for over ﬁve years. Bustin’
Out was released in 1971 and is all of a sudden making it big. You
know why? It’s very hip to be into c/w rock. Look at the New Riders
gig this summer. They are horrendously terrible but not one soul has
said a bad word about them. Christ, if they’d been into them they
should have seen ‘them with the Dead back in 1970 when Garcia was
playing steel guitar, not that steel-fingered rotten Buddy Page. And
what’s worse, people said he was the best they’d ever heard...I’d be
willing to bet that he was the first and only they’ve ever heard.

And these guys. I’ve had both of their albums since their release. If
you want to hear a good one get the first L.P...don’t listen to the RCA,
graft-work on the radio and don’t get caught up in the hipness of it all.
Listen to some real good c/w rock...make a decision for yourself.
Instead of buying Fullfillingness First Finale try Tracy Nelson, or the
Cowboy’s first two albums, or'Workingman’s Dead and try Waylon
Jennings...but try. Please try.

Like Ninety-Two in the Shade,
The Sporting Club is about a young

strives to outrage the other

Both of these albums have the
common denominator of un-

_ﬂood. And, unfortunately, both

fglfould be better...they ‘ have the

talent captured on vinyl, but with
two poor engineering jobs and
production oversights they lack the
punch that both of these artists are
usually associated with.

The Getz album is somewhat of an a

historic collector’s item- You will
notice that Stan Clarke, Tony
Williams, Chick Corea and Airto

‘  sidemen for Getz’s work.
. 5 This ‘union came about in 1971

when Getz travelled to England
and met up with Corea and
commissioned him to a series of
gigs. The album was a result of

shows in ‘ New York which Getz
seemed to like very much.

V tomorrow and Friday.

The driving force on this album is
quite evident...Corea and Clarke
take away the show from the horn
work Getz obviously thought would
enthrall his audience. Though
adequate, his playing seems more
stinted because of the overpower-
ing backup personnel. This fact in
and of itself creates a tension not
common to Getz’s style...the cool
ﬂavorful liquid style associated
with Stan Getz. ‘

Corea wrote ﬁve of the six tunes
and features some of the strongest
playing he has to date. Clarke at
the time of this recording(1972)
was twenty...a “stripling from
Philadelphia” and is an interesting
contrast to his own solo effort
recently released.

‘Where Fortune Smiles is very
similar to Extrapolation mainly
because of the personnel but also
because this was McLaughlin's
transition period...from the Han-
cock sideman and traditional
guitarist to the more spacier and
free-form player that we know of
today. His speed was always the
talk of the local musicians and his
chording was regarded as ﬁller, but
not until he hit the stage as solo
artist did people really stop and
look. A

I think it is fair to say that the
reason this album was released is
primarily economic. Jazz is a
viable economic gold mine.
Mahavishnu most certainly has a
following and releasing older tapes
will bring in the bread.

Give‘ Me A Break, Bill House, RCA

(BELI-0786)! ! ! !!

Who is Bill House and why does

   

he wear all white on the album
cover? I’m really sorry but I can't
answer those questions because
I’m too busy trying to ﬁgure out
how for Christ's sake this guy got
where he is...he should be with a
better label. He's good.
Sounding a little like Boz Scaggs
and a little like my friend Ed when
he’s drunk, Bill House weaves a
nice blanket to hide under when
you’re down in the mouth...he has
a command of lyrics and melodies

that seems to be so overlooked"

when new artists are broken.
There isn’t a thing wrong with this

album. It sounds real pretty,-‘plays’

real goodand tastes really ﬁne with
a little Lambrusco. The mellow
parts won’t bring you down far
enough to the bottom so you can’t
get back up, and the up parts'won’t
send you out on to some gaseous
conﬁguration that’ll let you ﬂoat
too high.

Musically this is a very tight band
that moves around all the popular
musical themes...a little country, a
little blues “You’re No Better Than
A Common Thieve,” a little bosa
nova “The Damage is Done” and a
little good ol’ funk “We Could Be.
So Good Together.’’,

The term appealing would be a
misnomer...it is extremely appeal-
ing to the ear and senses but not so
appeasing to the commercial
expressions of. the recording
industry. With a simple’ rhyme
scheme hesets up within one song
a complex musical format that
resolves itself in the form" of a
simple sounding tune.

So aside from‘ playing good,
writing well- and sounding good
what else can Bill House do? He
sings with a sweet melodic ﬂavor.
The voice matches the song...and
singing sweetly through the soft
songs_ on RCA, Bill House will steal
vour heart....sweetsie.

capsule made by the club's
founders.

Stanton’s restless energy and
grand inventiveness are reminis-
cent of heroes of other ﬁne recent
novels. He has the ability to grab
people’s attention like McMurphy

One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s ‘Nest.

and Samson Shillitoe A Fine
Madness.

Quinn’s recollections of Stanton:

Stanton experimented with hair-
cuts, wore outﬁts, caught himself
and paused at mirrors, dark
windows; once asked people who
they thought he was. At thirteen
he bought rumba lessons with his
allowance and wrote Captain
Costeau requesting citizenship in
the ﬁrst underwater city.

Much of the book is devoted to
Stanton’s complex relationship
with the more subdued Quinn.
Stanton and Quinn are foils like
Phineas and Gene in John
Knowles’ A Separate Peace. The
interaction between Stanton, Quinn
and Stanton’s mistress Janey rivals
the relationships. in John Barth’s
End of the Road and The Floating
Opera with its constant, subtle
shifts and developments.

In this ﬁrst novel, one can already
find the unique qualities of
McGuane’s ﬁction--the realistic

detailing of outdoor scenes, _the
inventive images, the intricate plot

' where each strange event develops

out of the one before it and a grisly
sense of humor.
McGuane is especially skilled at

creating minor characters to .

contrast with his heroes; here he
presents the ridiculously staid
members of the sporting club and
caretaker Earl - Olive and his
Deliverance-like friends.
‘The message of the time capsule
ties in with a major McGuane
concern; the transfer of the land to
people who don't appreciate it and
use it properly. In this area, The
Sporting Club preﬁgures his The
Bushwhacked Piano(1971).

First novels too often sink into
obscurity. lt’s good to have this

one back because The Sporting q

Club deserves a place in the
landscape of current American
ﬁction.

BY 'I_‘0M HALL

Pitt's Men’s and Women’s swim
teams scored double victories in
dual meet action Saturday over
Cleveland State with scores of
67-46 and 78-43 respectively.

In men's competition, Jerry De-
Muro set Cleveland State pool
records in the 1650 and 1000 yard
swims. Jerry’s time of 16:18.20 in
the 1650 also set a new Panther
team record for the event, as well
as qualifying him for the national
trials to be held at Cleveland State
in March. .

“I don't think there is any limit to
the progress DeMuro is making,”
coach ,Al Coffey said. “A lot of
' people said that he was too small to
be a long distance swimmer, but
Jerry is going out and proving all
those people wrong.”

‘‘I attended a national swimming
meet at Cincinnati the following
day.” Swim Coach Dick Bradshaw
said, “With the time Jerry had at
Cleveland State, he would have

, ﬁnished second in the 1650, and if

he had been in the race, he
probably would have won. His
talent and dedication‘to the sport
are remarkable.”

Also in the limelight at Cleveland
State, Carlos “Tonto” Santiago
won the 200 yard backstroke in

’ 2:00.2, setting a new pool record.

Eric Shultz won the 100 free in
50.3 seconds, John Templin won
the 200 yard breaststroke with a
time of 2: 18.66, and Pitt captured‘a
ﬁrst in the elusive 400 medley relay
in 3:47.24. In all the tankers won
nine of 13 events.

The diving team, however, did not
fare so well. Jeff Miller won the
one-meter diving with a score of
264.25. “Jeff is getting much
better, and showed excellent form
in the one-meter diving. He is still
short of qualifying for the nation-
als, but he still has one or two more
chances to do it,” said Coffey.

Dave Reeder copped the second
spot in the three-meter event with a
277.95. _"Dave’s performance
wasn’t what I expected from him,"
Coach Coffey said. “The divers
..have been plagued with illnesses
recently, and it has "hurt the whole
[Call]. '

Tom Fatyol has been seriously ill,
and he’s still weak, but he’s started
practicing again. Jack Garrow is
getting stronger, but he too is just
recovering from the flu.”

“We beat a good team in Cleve-
land State,” Coffey stated. “They

‘are recruiting heavily, and their

facilities, along with hosting the
NCAA’s, should make them a
national small college powerhouse
in the next couple of years.” i

The Women’s Swim Team, com-
ing off a tremendous win over
Slippery Rock (the first win ever for
the women’s team there) recipro-
cated by thrashing Cleveland State,
taking eight of fourteen ﬁrsts and
eleven of twelve seconds.

“We have about ten girls who
have qualiﬁed for the Eastern
Championships, and about ﬁve
who have qualiﬁed for the Nation-.
als” said Women’s Coach Kate
Matheson. -

Icers Overwhelm (.’Il’lU,
Alone In First, Place

BY STEVE SYBERT

Carnegie-Mellon put a scare into
the Pitt Hockey Club last Saturday
but that’s about all they did as the
undefeated Panthers skated away
with an 8-3 victory.

The Tartans took an early edge in
play and jumped out to a 3-1 first
period lead. Pitt played raggedly
at the start, failing to get off a shot
on goal until midway through the
frame.

Dave Cornelius opened the scor-
ing for CMU at 4:25 despite being
checked by Pitt defenseman John”
Finney. Five minutes later, Matt
Goldsmith gave the Tartans a 2-0
margin after taking a pass from the
corner with the Panther defense-
men out of position.

The Cats got on the scoreboard at
the 12:22 mark with Denny

Browne’s powerplay goal, but
CMU’s Mike Kenworthy came
right back with a rebound tally

following a spectacular save by Pitt ‘

goalie Johnny DeFazio on Corne-
lius’s breakaway attempt.

Between periods, Captain Charlie
Hagins /had the team take ﬁve
minutes to pull itself together, an
idea which was successful as Pitt
went on to score seven unanswered
goals.

Rick Vernon, the Western Penns-
ylvania Intercollegiate Hockey As-
sociation’s top scorer, started the
Pitt comeback with his first two
goals in still another hat trick
performance.

With 1:56 gone in the second
period, Vernon slapped a 30-footer.

Virginia Cavaliers.

It was a game that Pitt probably
shouldn't have won. They were
dominated much of the game by
the tight defense and deliberate

offense of the Cavaliers, ﬁnding"

themselves down by, ﬁve points
with just a couple of minutes
remaining. A late surge by the
Cats put them into thelead 61-60
with just seconds on the clock. But,
they couldn’t contain the Cavaliers
with just 13 seconds left and
Melvin Bennett, who played per-
haps his most outstanding game of
the year, was forced to foul himself
out of the game. Wally Walker
went to the foul line with two shots
and quickly knotted the score
sending the game into overtime.
The Cats had been down by as
much as ten points’ in the second
half, and their battle to gain a tie at
the end of regulation play was more
than could be expected of the
cold-shooting squad. But if their
first comeback was considered
spectacular, their second can not
be justly described. _ A
The Panthers fell behind in over-
time when Dan‘ Bonner, a Pitts-
burgh native, hit for four points
before the Cats realized the clock

‘had started. Things didn’t im-

prove after the ﬁrst several min-
utes with the Cavaliers trying to the
hold_ the ball and get out with their
lives. But Pitt wasn’t willing to
waste their super performance of
the second half despite a ﬁve point
deﬁcit with just two minutes to
play.

Kirk Bruce, who was ‘closely
guarded throughout the game, hit a
jump shot to keep the Cats in
contention. Jim Bolla was fouled in
the process of shooting and went to
the foul line to make one of two
shots. Lew Hill missed a chance at

tying the score with a tough lay-up _

and then went to the foul line to

make one of two, bringing Pitt

within one. A -
Meanwhile, at the other end of the

floor, Virginia was unable to main-

to the foul line twice, both times
following fouls against Tom Rich-
ards. But, Boninti was unable to
make the clutch free throws ena-

bling Pitt’s “super” Starr to once‘-~/3

With just seconds on the clock,
the Panthers inbounded the hall
after the Cavaliers had thrown it
away at mid-court due to the
‘devastating full-court _press of the
Panthers. Richards took the in-
bounds pass and crossed the center
stripe. He then passed the ball to

Grapplers Gain Split

In Weekend Tri-Meet

BY JAN MATTHEWS

“Splitting a double-header is like
kissing your sister.” I

This timeworn cliche does not
apply to Pitt’s wrestling action over
the weekend. '

After losing a close match to
Syracuse, 21-18, the grapplers
destroyed the Marauders of Mil-
lersville, 28-13.

Coach Dave Adams was in no
mood for an incestrial relationship.

“No way are we happy to come
out with a draw,” he said. “We are
disappointed that we did not win
both.”

Syracuse had no such disappoint-
ment. The Orangement also de-
feated Millersville to go 2-0 for the
day. Coming in with a record of
12-2, Syracuse had little trouble
against the Panthers.

After Kevin Nellis picked up a
decision in the opening match, the
Orange won the next six to take a
commanding 21-3 lead.

Pins by Bill Bailey and Carl Roba
in the last two matches only made
the score close. '

All-American George Bryant,
wrestling in the 126 pound class,
was involved in the pivotal match.

After taking command of his
opponent, Randy Gillette, he al-

lowed Gillette to get the advantage '

for a fall. _
Also hurting the Panther cause

was the loss of another All-Amerb
can, Rande Stottleiiieyer.

is not as experienced as Rande,”
explained Adams, “and it showed.

‘ We would like to think that it would

have made a difference.”

Millersville presented more of a
problem to the matmen than the
score indicates.

The Marauders opened up a 10-6
lead halfway through the match,
but Pitt came back on the strength
of pins by Danny Levine and Craig
Evans to take a 22-10 lead.

Adams was impressed by Millers-
ville. _

‘‘I said it before, and I still think
they are the third best state college
team in Pennsylvania, just behind
Clarion (who defeated Pitt) and
Slippery Rock.”

Unfortunately for Pitt’s wrestlers,
cliches do not tell the whole story
sometimes.

PINS AND POINTS: Levine wres-
tled in spite of his injury. George
O’Korn, his back-up, came down
with the flu. Levine lost his first

match ofgthe season, he is now ,

4-1...Roba picked up two falls...
Nellis continued wrestling impres-
sively, with a pair of wins...Bryant

came back with a superior decisiopQ:. _
(worth four points instead of thew-1“

usual three) after being upset by

tionally , ranked Penn State has
been switched from Saturday to
Sunday at 2:00 pm...Adams is
looking for a big student turnout.



“Greg Soergel, -his replacement, ‘:4

BY JIM SPANOS

John Endsley was drinking a can
of Pepsi, about eight feet of Ace
bandages taped around his right
thigh. The Pitt JV team had just
defeated arch-enemy West Virginia
75-64 for their tenth win of the

- /égyason, and Endsley was beaming.

He had scored 21 points.

“I wanted to beat these guys,
because there’s always a big rivalry
between us,” Endsley said. A
similar feeling of delight had
overcome Robert Haygood, Frank
Boyd, Mark Disco, Terry Knight

and Scott Stephens, since the
Panthers had avenged an opening
loss against the Mountaineers in
Morgantown.

The scope of what these guys felt
after the game, in fact what they
have felt all season long, encom-

play varsity ball. A

They are an integral part of every

leading rebounder with 15, six
ahead of anyone else.

Bruce continued to pour in the
shots. He hit just three ﬁeldgoals in
the first half but managed to total
20 for the game, with four in the
overtime. Starr only managed eight
points but half of his output came
in the crucial overtime. Richards
came up just short of his average

Pitt to a close conclusion as so
many teams have so far this year.

for a starting guard position next
year, but from the tone of conver-
sation in the locker rooms, signs of
conflict just don’t exist.

Frank Boyd sat motionless on his
stall by his locker, and talked about
Pitt basketball. -

“They tried,” Boyd said of "the
just defeated Mountaineers. He
continues: ‘5We knew we_ were
going to win. You know, we’re a
together bunch of guys, we have a
lot of fun togehter. I hope I can play
varsity next year, but I have to
work hard Over the summer.”

Assistant coach Fran Webster
said that Boyd “has the best shot
next year ‘at filling‘ in at Kirk’s
(bruce) position, “but is quick to
point out that “all of these boys
(Boyd, Nedrow, Knight, and Hay-
good) have a very good chance of
playing varsity ball next year."

Haygood, a sophomore who plays
quarterback for Majors and Co., is
averaging 20 points per game,
scored 18 "against West Virginia.
Before giving his opinion of the
situation, he laughs, glances over
at Boyd, then . answers calmly,

“The competition is good for the
team. It’s a long stretch and you’

need a lot of guys who can play.
The good thing about this team is
that everyone on the team comple-
ments each other.”

A man'who has done more than
his share thus far is Terry Knight,
whom Webster feels is destined to
have an outstanding career at Pitt.
“He’s- a great ballplayer,‘ and
Terry’s' going to come on real
strong next year,” are the exact
words Webster uses. This year
Knight is leading the team /in
rebounding and against WVU he

poured in 14 points.

Nedrow has been hammered by
an injury and a bad internal
infection, and he's trying to get a
medical redshirt, which would give
him three more years of eligibility.

Basketball teams, like individuals,
have a personality which gives
those persons around them certain
impressions. Vibes, if you wish.
This Pitt basketball team, JV as
well as varsity, has an unselfish,
mature character exemplified by a
healthy attitude about eacth other,
as Mark Disco makes apparent.

“I’m happy with mynlife at Pitt.
As long as I feel I'm helping the
team, l’m.happy.” Disco, you must
understand, is a junior who’s seen
little varsity action; but “Disc”
understands his situation. “There
have to be guys behind the guys on
varsity, and I’m just glad to be a

   

part of the team.”

The “Biggest” part of the team is
6'11” sophomore center Scott Ste-
phens. “It's been a real good
year,” Stephens proudly announ-
ces. “That was nice beating West
Virginia. Next year...wel1, I need to
work on my quickness, jumping
ability, and running over the
summer. There’s a real good
attitude on this team. We clown
around a lot together.” I

Endsley is quick to point out that
Stephens‘ is the only clown on the
team, to which Stephens has no
reply. Two players of which little
has been said are _Wayne Talbott
and Dom Berardinelli. Talbott, like
Nedrow, has been injured through-
out the year, and is applying for a
redshirt. Bernardinelli is a walkon
who scored four points against
West Virginia.

BY RICK STOUFFER
Associate Sports Editor

Gordon Jones is Pitt’s
football recruit of the year.

Gordon Jones also has a split
personality. His 6’2” 178 pound
body conceals two entirely different
people.

The ﬁrst person is the one
encountered when you talk to the
guy. He walks kind of slow and

first

talks a bit slower but you don’t-

mind. Whatever he says is not
conceited garbage, it's straight
talk.

“Up until the fourth grade I lived
in Buffalo. I started playing
football there at the local Boy’s
Club. Then when I moved to North
Versailles I started in Little League
ball.

Listening to his slow waltz-like
words it’s hard to believe when this
kid f_rom Pittsburgh’s suburbs gets
on a football field, any football field
he is napalm. In other words, too

. hot to handle.

Looking at his statistics it is hard
to imagine a better senior season.
Playing offensive split end Jones
caught 43 passes, gained 916 yards
from those completions, gained 90
yards rushing on six"carries, and
caught 15 TD passes.

 A   lat defense

.' esa.gyi._;14f?:bruary..‘I9.;i97.5 - ’

either. He intercepted ﬁve passes
and ran’ two for touchdowns,
recovered four fumbles running
one of those back, and returned
punts 247 yards with a six pointer
thrown in for good measure.

If statistics aren’t your idea of

excellence look at his honors. First

team All-State on both the UPI and
AP lists, Big 33 nominee, MVP in
the AA Keystone Conference,
All-Star for both offense and *

defense for the conference’, WPIAL
coaches All-Star, and last and
certainly most, High School All-
American.

Recruitment was an everyday
occurrence for Jones as the na-
tion’s football factories came court-
ing. Notre Dame, Ohio State,
Michigan State, Purdue, WVU,
and Pitt were chief competitors.

“I chose Pitt for four main
reasons,” said the lanky Senior.
“It’s close to home, I liked the area
when I went downtown for camp, I
think I can get help if I have
academic problems, and I like the
social life of a big city.

According to Jones’ coach at East
Allegheny, Mister Botta, great
words are nothing but cliches when
describing his top player.

“A strong point in my mind for
athletes is their ability to take
advice and not argue and in this
way Gordon is one of the best I’ve
ever coached. Once he is made to
realize an idea he will ask ‘no
questions but will turn around and
do it. Easily coached is really an
understatement. ’ ’

Jones’ easy going manner off the
field affects all who come near him.

“I know it sounds like old hat but
everybody likes Gordon,” Botta
continued. Even opposition

' players hold him in respect.” Until
5 he burns their uniform off.

With 1006 yards (almost half of
his team’s total offense) Jones does
not rely entirely on blinding speed.

“Gordon’s forte is quickness
rather than speed,” said Botta-.
Couple this with huge hands and
great leaping, ability (he has a
vertical jump of about 37 inches)
plus his exceptional ability to run

after catching the ball and you can
see why his play is so great.”

With all the impressive stats and
honors will Jones be the Tony
Dorsett of offensive ends at Pitt?

‘‘I’m expecting a lot of tough
competition my first year (from
Karl Farmer) but I’ll work hard and
should see a lot of action.”

Botta believes Jones might not "be
the sensational player he can be the
ﬁrst year. “It’s- hard to tell when

ones: A Split Personality

Gordon will blossom. He’s capable
of immediate success but that
doesn’t mean it will happen. He
will deﬁnitely learn a lot from his
competition. And he will im-
prove.”

Then at 6:49 Vernon began .a
Panther barrage of three goals in a
minute and 22 seconds by ﬁring a
powerful shot which dribbled into
the net after being knocked down
by Sciulli.

Jeff Saunders scored what turned
out ot be the winning goal at 7:43
by flipping a close-in shot through
a maze of players and into the net
for a 4-3 Pitt lead.

Twenty seconds later, Vernon

took off on another one of his solo

rushes, skated around two CMU
defenders and beat Sciulli for his
third goal of the game.

In third period action, the Pan-
thers failed to relent. Bill Gedeon,
on a partial breakaway, blasted in a
30-footer with 2:34 ‘gone to make it
6-3.

Life is but an arena, and we’re all
players. This bit of abused
philosophy is tucked in the head of
Pitt’s Denny Browne.»

You wouldn’t know it to look at
him, but Browne is a hockey bum.

r./"‘,.',l.‘.o hear him talk, you’d think a year

began in October and ended in
May, dates coinciding with training
camp and championship playoffs.
Political science major and senior
year notwithstanding, hockey
comes first.

Browne’s an American living the
traditionally Canadian dream of
hockey, hockey-, hockey. Where
there is no ice, improvise. No stick,
use a broom.
recruit someone off the street.
Marry a female hockey player to
provide companionship and com-
fort on and off the ice.

The twenty-three year old tries to
keep his passion casual and
But any prolonged
conversation with him turns inevit-
ably to talk of hockey.

.Ask him of his ice experience.

“Well, I’ve been playing for eight
years--ever since the rink in South
Park opened. Iplayed in the PAHL
(Pennsylvania Amateur Hockey
League) from day one.” Browne

No teammates, -

warms to his tale and speaks more
rapidly. “I’ve been with the Pitt
team for five years, since we got
started. You might say I'm one of
the original guys who founded the
team.”

The extended stints were not
without recognition. The league’s
coaches have always included him
in their voting for the annual
All-Star teams. Browne now plays
left wing on Pitt’s most productive
scoring line. The present “Goals
Incorporated” line ‘of Browne,
Charly Hagins- and Rick Vernon
was preceded by the “Lush” line of
Browne, Bill“Glanville and the late
Phil Clarke.

“The names kind of say it all.
Before, we were just guys out for a
good time. Hockey was a lot of fun,
something we all loved to do. But
now, things have changed a little.
Pitt’s been the champion for ﬁve
years, and we’re all pretty serious
about keeping it that way.”

It goes unsaid that if Browne were
truly serious about hockey, as a
career, he wouldn’t be at Pitt. The
“team” is actually a club without
formal athletic status. The league
(Western Pennsylvania Intercolle-
giate Hockey) is weak and limited.

“This league’s no good for us.
We have no real competition. I

keep playing on the same level. I
can’t get any better.”

The alternative, of no use to
Browne because he'll graduate this
April, is to have the Pitt Hockey

-Club go varsity. With the change
would come all the related benefits
and problems.

“I really think it would be worth
the hassle, though. Some of the
guys on this team are good--real
good--and they could cut it in a new

* league. When we’ve played teams

like Iona, Nassau, Brooklyn and
Villanova--teams with their own
risks--we’ve /done well. I think that
says something about our quality.”

Browne is concerned with the
development of the current Pitt
team. “The ﬁrst line gets the most
ice time; the second line gets less,
but more than they had been
getting; and the third line hardly
gets on the ice at all. That’s gotta
change if we want to make sure
that next year’s team doesn’t
collapse when some of the guys
graduate.”

His own development was under-
standably a cause for concern until
recently. He said before the
February 6 game with Johnstown,
“I haven’t been able to score at all.
I've been missing a lot of shots.
Once I even missed an open net.”

  Browne Completing All-Star Career  

The growing alarm of stagnation
disappeared after the game, in
which Browne scored five goals and
three assists for eight points on the
night.

The deluge of goals has slowed
down since then, but Browne is still
third in total and league scoring for
Pitt. His over-all record is 14 goals,
17 assists and 24 penalty minutes.
Only his linemate,Vemon, with 54
points, and Bill Gedeon, with’ 40,
surpass him.

Last ‘year, Browne was ﬁfth
among the league scorers with 19
points. He was twelfth highest in
penalty minutes with 18. Browne’s
ten goals and nine assists made
him second in Pitt scoring. While
many of the league players have
boosted their totals this year,
Browne’s record will probably net
him a spot near the top of the
charts.

Pitt’s season ends in mid-March,
but Browne’s will continue indeﬁn-
itely. “A bunch of guys and I get
together every summer--we’re
actually a team with uniforms that
somebody donated to us--and play
at Monroeville. We’re called
‘Frank’s Lunch’ and we still meet
Thursdays and Saturdays to
skate.” ‘
