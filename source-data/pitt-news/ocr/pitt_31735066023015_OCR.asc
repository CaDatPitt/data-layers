New SGB Members Escape To Orientation Weekend

.Bv MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer
‘Approximately 20 persons from
Student Government Board, the
Office‘ of Student Activities and
SGB’s Allocations Committee are

escaping this afternoon from

Oakland to Monroeville for a
retreat weekend that has as one of
its purposes a quick orientation of
new student government members
to the operations of that office.
The weekend at Our Lady of
Hope Retreat Center will cost at
minimum $1,020 paid through
SGB’s general account that is
funded solely by student activities’
fees. That sum reflects a 3536 per

gerson fee for room and board and

a $100 stipend for each of three
persons from the- schools of
education and community; and.
mental health who will instruct .10 ..

the Task Force on the student
activities fee and former board
member.

“In the first Task Force meeting
we discussed and determined that
there was a necessity for a fee
increase,” DeMatteo said. “We
then movedon to the question of
how much the increase ‘would be.”

“I don’t think there’ll be much of
a problem having the proposal
passed by Student Government.
The problem we might encounter is

seminars during the weekend. Not
included will be fees.for transport-

. ation _and other costs that may

become necessary.

Despite the price-tag, SGB
President Bill Abraham, Student.
Activities Director Andy Smith and
his assistant Jack Brown, believe
that the retreat will produce
numerous beneﬁts for the board

and its roughly 100 ‘protectorate’

student organizations.

Brown said yesterday that the
seminars planned ‘for the weekend
will help the board strengthen
managerial skills necessary for
efﬁcient operation; learn how to,
keep sight of goals and priorities,
and distribute knowledge of how

students, administration, faculty,

and staff operate. All this, Brown
said,‘ will‘ make SGB “_a better

voice,_ a ‘more effective, student]

 

with the Board of Trustees. It’s the
responsibility of Student Govern-
ment to take the next step.”

The Allocations Committee turn-
ed down some requests in the past
for funding certain organizations’
programs through student activi-
ties’ money, according to DeMat-
teo. _

between groups as we did last

I Student Government. Board Pres-
ident Bill Abraham, in his

. inaugural address Tuesday, told

his newly elected board that it must
meet the challenges of 1980 with
_ “ingenuity, innovation, and in-
sight.”
“The world is moving into a new

‘decade and with it, we are moving
p intoa new era,” Abraham said.

~ ‘ Abraham addressed the board at
3its inauguration dinner before ‘a
group of administrators, student
leaders and guests in the Student
Union Ballroom.

Teamwork will be the key to a
successfulyear for the new board,
according to Abraham. .

“We must takethe "established
system to the limit, and sometimes,
outside that system (to accomplish
the board’s goals),” said Abraham.

Some of the new board’s goals,’

according to Abraham, ‘are:
—Backing an increase in the
student activities fee,

organization,” with effectiveness
ﬁltering down to groups that the
board oversees during process like
annual allocations. Goals of those
organizations might be realized, he
said, by following proper techni-
que. I -
Allocations will be one’ of the
priorities of the weekend-long
seminar, with orientations made to
the budget and hearing process
that/'rs— conducted, throughout

The Allocations Committee has

_recently been reviewed with its

procedures and members revamp-
ed and reappointed, due to
criticism in the past that centered
aroundcommittee recommendation
for organization funding. Those
recommendations were said to fall
short of ;certain jorganizations’

The proposal is “strictly a
recommendation to the Board of
Trustees,” she added.

SGB President Bill Abraham
says he is not worried excessively
about student backing of the
proposed increase.

V’ ‘..‘I’ve discussed with Andy Smith
what would be possible administra-
tion reactions to the proposal,”
Abraham said. “The Task Force

SGB President Bill Abraham said
that although the retreat still must
prove its merits as well as warrant
its cost, he is optimistic about the
results. -

“I thinkit’ s important to realize
that this (the beginning of a new
administration) is a very crucial
time for the board, ” Abraham said,
adding that SGB members are not
familiar with the channels of .
communications through”, which
they must proceed to produce
results, and which persons at the
university are keys to progress.

“In the past it has taken weeks,
months, for SGB members to get

that such delay means that there is
less time to accomplish goals.

‘Pitt's fraternities have been
described by local residents as loud

and drunken, often leading to

-Those same residents may-
change their tune, because Pitt’s
Delta Tau Delta fraternity is

. causing another public display, a

display of charity.

The brothers of Delta Tau Delta
are walking from Morgantown, ,
W. Va., to Pittsburgh starting
Friday at 10 a.m. and ending at 5
p.m. Saturday to collect money for
the Heart Fund. . .

program council ﬁnancially, since
the proposal stipulates that 35
percent of the Student Activities
fee will automatically be used by
the council.

The current program council
contract would be voided if the
proposal is approved, Abraham
added.

“They (the board of Governors)

I will also take care of checking for

representation of programming,”
Abraham said. “What I mean by
this, is that they will attempt to
make sure that there is a diversity

"of programming catering to the

majority of Pitt students.”

“If a healthy campus atmos-
phere is to prevail, we have to be
diverse enough in programming

average of 20 miles,” said Bill
Simon, chairman of the Delt charity
committee.

Along the way back to Pitts-
burgh, the brothers will be
stopping at grocery stores,
department stores and shopping
malls to collect money for their goal
of $8,000.

“We have 45 active brothers and
they are all participating in the
walk, so we have 100 percent
participation, ” said Simon.

“The walk will end with all the
brothers meeting at Forbes and
Craft (Avenues) for a parade up
Forbes,” said Simon.

Meeting the brothers for the
ﬁnal trek up Forbes will be Pitt
alumni and the WFFM Bird.

that, one way or another, the
student body will get involved,”
Abraham said. “It’s hard to appeal
to everyone without a series of
diverse programming.”

It appears likely that the ‘SGB
will approve the proposal Tuesday,
sending it to the Office of Student
Activities for further approval. If
Student Activities approves the
proposal, it will be forwarded to
Vice Chancellor for "Student Affairs
Conney Kimbo, according to Andy
Smith, Director of Student Activit-
res. \

“From there it.would be sent to
the Senior Vice Chancellor Jack
Freeman,” said ‘Smith.

Many organizations’ budgets
were cut in the past due to the lack
of available funds. An increase in
the activities fee would help_

“Planning for the walk started in
September with the selling of
coupon books to pay the expenses
of the walk,” Simon said.

The brothers’ preparations for
the walk-a-thon included contact-
ing l2 police chiefs from various
townships for solicitation permits.

“I met with all the police chiefs
in person to discuss the walk in
depth,” said Simon.

The stores‘ acting as collection
points were also contacted for their
permission.

“The Heart Fund is supporting
us 100 _percent,” said Simon.

"‘They gave us heart-shaped candy

to give out, posters and banners.
“The idea for the walk-a-thon
originated at Thiel University,

alleviate this problem and provide‘

additional monies to “funds the
kind of activities that Pitt students
deserve,” according to Smith.

The increased activities fee may
concern some administrators and
students since it would increase the
cost of education for Pitt students,
Smith said. However, it is needed
to “catch us up to where we should
be,” he added.

According to. the proposal, the
money acquired from the increase
will be distributed as follows: 50
percent to the Student Government
Allocations Committee, 35 percent
to the program council Board of
Governors, anf 15 percent to the
Student Publications and Media
Board. - €

Some of the areas the additional
money would be used for include

where they have been having one-
for 16 years with great success.
We got the idea from Allegheny
(College), who also walks. In their
ﬁrst year; they raised $6,000,” said
Simon.

The brothers decided to .have
collection points and collection cans
instead of sponsors for the walk-a
thon because of the difﬁculties with
collecting the money after the walk.

“Collecting money with the cans
means we will know exactly how
much we received right away,”
said Simon.

The funds collected will be
announced at the celebration party
Saturday night at ‘the Delta Tau
Delta fraternity.

saving Backspace, Pitt’s nationally
acclaimed journal from possible
extinction, and paying for a
program council concert series,
according to Smith. I ’

Abraham, Smith and DeMatteo
are conﬁdent that the proposal will ‘
eventually be approved. Also, they
all believe the proposed increase
will be placed before the student
body in a referendum vote for ﬁnal
approval.

If the increase is decided by
referendum, Smith, Abraham and
DeMatteo will depend on student
leaders to lobby for its passage.

“I’m‘ kmping for its approval by
the fall term,” said Smith. “I’ll
beg, plead, barter but most of all,
urge its approval.”

Pittsburgh - LA. Mayors Make Wager

By.Thc Associated Press

The mayors of Pittsburgh and Los Angeles made a
face-to-face friendly wager Thursday over the outcome of
Super Bowl XIV—but they never left their respective cities.

The two were linked via a picturephone meeting service
by Bell Telephone of Pennsylvania and Paciﬁc Telephone
in California, 3,500 miles away.

Los Angeles Mayor Thomas Bradley told Pittsburgh
Mayor Richard Caliguiri he had already invited the Los
Angeles media to partake of his expected winnings, a case
of Pittsburgh’s Iron City beer and a case of kielbasa Polish
sausage.

Bradley bet a case of oranges and reminded Caliguiri
that he has already won a case of buckeyes by wagering on
the Southern Cal-Ohio State contest in the Rose Bowl.

Caliguiri countered that he already has won a case of
three-alarm Texas chili from Dallas, a 55-gallon drum of oil
from Houston, and that Pittsburgh’s city ﬂag ﬂew over
Cleveland twice.

The Pittsburgh Steelers meet the Los Angeles Rams in
the Super Bowl at Pasadena on Jan. 20.

Hostages Held for Iran Ship Demand
B The Associa ed Press
A pregnant woman and hef two children were held at

gunpoint for the second day Thursday by a man claiming to
be a Moslern prophet who demanded a ship to take him to
Iran, police aid. ‘ 1

Heavily armed police surrounded a 2‘/2-story house in

the city’s Beltzhoover section where Samuel Andrews. 27,,‘

an unemployed security guard, held the captives since 5
p.m. Wednesday.

“This is the year 701, the day of judgment, and I have
been ordered to act by Allah. I am doing this for’ the
people,” one ofﬁcer quoted the gunman as saying.

Although the man, who calls Andrews his “slave
names” and refers to himself as Sampson Solomon
Mohammed, fired. at least a half dozen shots since the
siege began, there were no injuries, authorities said.

The hostages, Arlene Ware, 22, and her children, ages 4
and 2, reportedly were in good condition, police said.

Andrews, armed with a high-powered pistol and said by
neighbors to have a cache of weapons, began a telephone
dialogue Thursday morning after refusing to speak to
authorities earlier.

“He calls us. We call him. He answers. We answer.
We're doing everything we can to make sure no one is
harmed,” said police Lt. John Vuch.

The ofﬁcer said two of Andrews’ cousins asked him to
surrender, assuring him that he wouldn't be hurt:

“He refused to do that. They asked him to release the
hostages and he refused to do that, too. He kept referring
to the woman as the daughter of the ‘yakuub.’
I understand that’s the Islamic word for Satan, ’ ’ the ofﬁcer

Pa. Farmers Feel Effects of Grain Embargo

Bv The Associated Press

HARRISBURG—Agriculture officials said Thursday that
the effect of the grain sale embargo against Russia is
already being felt among Pennsylvania farmers.

Pennag Industries Association said some Pennsylvania
farmers already’ have cancelled fertilizer orders for next
spring, and are holding back on placing seed orders.

“Farmers are ialready thinking about their spring
planting, and any disruption in future markets have an
effect on their planning,” said Chet Heim, state depgty
agriculture secretary. . "“

President Jimmy Carter has halted the sale of 17 million
metric tons of grain that was to be delivered to the Soviet
Union by next September. P

Carter has promised that the U.S. government would
buy the grain that would have been paid for by Russia.

In the meantime, trading on the commodity exchanges
was slow. ’ ,

Philip Van Lieu of Dillsburg, a sales manger for Todd
Hybrid Sales, said farmers are reluctant to place seed
orders for spring planting.

A predicted 25 percent drop in grain prices would wipe
out the farmers’ profits, Van Lieu said, adding, “I feel by
planting time, things will straighten out. '

‘ ‘They can’t afford not to farm. but then they can’t afford
to lose money, either,” he said. .

Pennsylvania doesn’-t have as many large grain growers

as the Midwest, but it has large feed manufacturers and 

cattle and poultry farmers who use the grain.

The board will have to educate students on the
benefits that a higher acti'.'iLics fee will produce.

Accompanying the arrival of a new year are
reflections on the past, countless resolutions, and at
Pitt, a new Student Government Board. The 1980
board assumed office last Tuesday, and it has already
begun its crash course in representing Pitt’s
undergraduates. '

‘ An equally difficult job will be the annual hearing
 and budget process for student organizations. It is a .

complex process, and often some groups become

irate over what they see as inadequate funding for
their organizations. In order to survive the rigors
involved during the process, the new board must
treat each organization fairly, examining each budget
closely for its merits and drawbacks. gt:

SGB president Bill Abraham, a relatively
inexperienced sophomore, must. overcome his naivete
‘(concerning the workings of the vast university
bureaucracy) to lead an equally inexperienced board.
The job will not be easy considering the number of
issues and problems the board must address.

In addition to the increase in the activities fee and
the annual allocation/budget process, the board
must push for university‘ support for the renovation
of the student union and the construction of an FM
radio station. Both projects have been in the
planning stages for a long time, and action is needed
now to institute them.

The most important issue at hand is increasing the
student activities fee. The $12 a term stipend, in
existence at its current rate for more than 10 years, is
barely enough‘ to fund Pitt’s student organizations.
A task force, formed last term to prepare a proposal
to increase the fee, has completed its work,
recommending a new fee of $24 per term.

The Abraham administration will be judged by the
students and this newspaper, on how it handles these
and other problems. But the new board must be
' . . given a chance to get its feet ‘wet’ before any
If the SGB passes the .proposal(as it Pl'0b3b1Y judgements are made.

will),the boardmust convince university authorities
‘and the studentbody that the increase is warranted.
Persuading students, already strapped with rising
tuition and inﬂated living costs, will be difficult.

.Pii’r°'s Progressive Past

0

Editor '5' note: Thefollowing article was
submitted to The Pitt News by
Qhancellor Wesley W. Posvar. Al-
though it was intended to run can-
currently with a Pitt News series on the
l970’s at Pitt, changes in scheduling
have forced us ‘to publish it separate.

Shakespeare's noted phrase
from The Tempest, “What’s Past
is Prologue” applies most aptly to
any university, particularly this
one.

We are an institution fundamen-
tally shaped by the past, but deeply
concerned with the future of
society. At Pitt, we take this
responsibility very seriously. Care-
ful planning accomplished during
the. 70s has helped ready this
Institution for ﬁnancial constraints
and also for signiﬁcant progress in
the 305; signs of that progress
already are evident.

On the national level, higher
education in the 1970s was put
under tremendous pressure; it was
at first a period of critical
reappraisal—-much of it creative,
but some of it suspicious and
disruptive; later. the decade was
beset by inﬂation and the necessity

for budget stringency and re-
trenchment. Continued inﬂation,
coupled with declining educational
markets and ﬁscal constraints will
pose additional challenges to the
ingenuity of our faculty and admin-
istrators in the coming decade.

I am conﬁdent that we shall meet
these challenges. By the later
1980s, I expect that the research
university will be seen even more
clearly than today as a prime
resource for this country’s indus-
trial health and economic progress,
as well as cultural enrichment.

Already, business and education
are engaged in dialogue and
becoming ‘poised for joint projects
that could give this country some of
the far-reaching answers it needs
and that could move our campuses
to a productive role like that they
enjoyed following World War II.
This University is a member of a
new coalition involving top aca-
demic and. corporate leaders called

the Business-Higher Education‘

Forum, which is part of this
momentum. Energy "research,
development and conservation are
among our ﬁrst order§ of business.

 

ReadiesUniversiiy ForThetl98iO"s   I

There are other national predic-
tions, easy enough to make,
because of the shadows before
them—the changing nature of
student bodies both in numbers
and constituencies (and their
changing needs); continuing ﬁscal
pressure; the mounting importance
of providing opportunity for tal-
ented young faculty; and changing
manpower needs and the corres-
ponding effect on many ﬁelds of
academic specialization. Next I
shall look inwardly at how this
institution will fare inthe 80s and
mention a few‘ of the developments
this University community may be
experiencing in the coming ten
years.

Students-. The total student body
is likely to shrink in size, but we
shall attract’ a broader range of
students and expand certain
advanced programs. '

As for examples, engineering
should increase its graduate
enrollment; a new undergraduate
major in business will accommo-
date up to 400 full-time students;
the School of Law can expect a
stable enrollment; the demand for

information scientists will increase.
In all the health sciences demand is
predicted to remain high with the
problem being that of opening new
opportunities with limited resour-
ces. .

I believe our accelerating honors

_program will greatly -stimulate its

enrollees and faculty and help
enrich the experience of much of
our student body. Our programs
for equal opportunity will increas-
ingly stress excellence as a critical
factor in attaining social justice.
We shall have more students in

mid-career and mid-life, both in '

our ‘ part-time courses and in
academic programs tailored for

individuals seeking challenging

opportunities to follow their intel-
lectual inclinations. _ ’

Our foreign student population is
likely to increase further, reflecting
in large part our growing inﬂuence
abroad as a quality institution.

Physical Plant. The emphasis
will be on renovation and moderni-
zation of the‘ older parts of a
physical-plant that is now largely in
place. Foremost needs are for
renovation of the student union and

 

the ﬁeld house, and new or
refurbished facilities for business,
mathematics, medical research
dental clinical service, and studio
and theater arts. Some of these are
likely to be funded in the next few
years, either by state, university or
private funds.

Programs. The University willgw

continue to strengthen our core
program in the arts and ‘sciences
and in the professions. At the
same time, more multidisciplinary
programs for undergraduates and
graduates are anticipated. - Some
professional options will be devel-’
oped within the liberal arts
programs, but the concept of the
liberal arts will be reinforced,
perhaps with. newly formulated
core-areas of study.

More interdisciplinary coopera-
tion in the 1980s will improve our
ability to contribute to the solutions
of pressing national concerns. The
tendency of disciplines to overlap is V
becoming more pronounced. For
example, social and behavioral

scientists now must be concerned
with public health along with

(Continued from page 6)
doctors, for the leading causes of
faltering health or early death are
behavioral excesses in smoking,
eating or drinking.

Signs of -increasing interdiscip-
linary activity here are evident; key
faculty express an urgent need for

it; our planning encompasses it in -

many areas, ‘among them neuro-
sciences, biomedical engineering,
pharmacology and synthesis of
chemotherapeutic agents, surface
science, urban and public policy,
global security, and information
science and knowledge use.

There are many more, and I
realize that I surely make important
omissions; with that caveat, I
would like to cite a few of the
dramatic thresholds that we may be

approaching as we enter the 80s,,

each of which could affect our

programs not only in research, but
also in teaching and public service:

We are learning about human
understanding at an increasing
rate. We are beginning to
comprehend objective distinctions
between an intelligent expert in a
discipline ‘and a skillful beginning
leader. Anew science of human
intelligence may even be emer-
ging, and this gives promise of
improving human intellectual po-
tential. This new science may
eventually change our vision of the
education process to the extent that
germ theories of disease in the past
century changed the practice of
medicine.

Foremost on everyone’s mind is
energy. This decade may bring a
“breakthrough” in some area of
basic research, perhaps in ways to
store solar energy, perhaps" in safe

use of fusion energy. The ramiﬁ-
cations would be staggering,
affecting not only our economy but
all global relations.

Human aging probably never
will be fully reversible (if that is
desirable), but we will surely make
some progress in how to extend
life, how to enrich it and how better
to understand its meaning and its
potential. The number of older
persons will grow substantially in
the coming decade, both nationally
and in the Western Pennsylvania
region; their special needs, medical
and social, must be met far better
than in the past.

At this University there is study
of means to prevent or reserve
human deaths that occur ‘prema-
turely or through accident; it is
estimated that half of the deaths in
industrialized countries are pre-

mature and some of them could be

prevented if means were developed»

to stimulate and maintain cardio-
vascular and pulmonary function-
ing under emergency conditions.

What is past is, truly, prologue.
At this moment our own University
astronomers are looking for new
planets, our anthropologists are
seeking further evidence of our
beginnings, while our philosophers
and classicists search for new
meanings to our lives based on
what has gone before. At this
institution, our liberal arts heritage
will continue and will be enhanced.
The humanities and the arts are the
core of our academic enterprise;
they stem from our history and they
will guide us into the future.

Throughout history, institutions
of higher learning have had an
unusual continuity of purpose.

They have survived and grown
through fundamental changes of
empire, political system and social
structure. They have been centers
for the generation of most of the
ideas and discoveries responsible
for human progress. I

In all likelihood, the most
important developments of the next
decade are unforeseen. We can
expect that some great discoveries

will emerge and, as -in the past, '
they will emerge from a climate in '

which ideas can be challenged and
minds can grow, where research
can thrive and where leaders can
develop.

When we commence our third
century of existence as an
institution of higher learning on
February 28, 1987, we should have
even greater reason to be proud,
confident, and convinced of the
worth of our purpose.

Sydney Harris, in his column on

. American colonialism (“Paying the

Price for Colonialism,” Pittsburgh
Post Gazette, Oct. 15), wrote
disparagingly of the U.S. and our
“feeble imitation of European
colonialism.” Harris says we, and
the countries of Europe, took what
we.wanted"“like gangs of criminals
disguised as patriots.”

These harmful and erroneous
statements of an inﬂuential writer
can hurt us at home and abroad.
Consequently, a refutation is
imperative. -

McKinley, when working with the
problem, said: “The Philippines
are ours, not to exploit, but to
develop, to civilize, to educate, to
train in the science of self-govem-
ment.” _
The brilliantly educated states-
man and benevolent humanitarian
William H’. Taft——later president
and chief justice of the Supreme
7Court-—was appointed civil govern-
or of the Philippines. In_ his

inaugural, Taft said, “We hold the 4

Philippines forthe benefit of the
Filipinos.” Later, independence
was granted to'the Philippines. -
In 1876, the U.S. signed a trade
agreement with Hawaii that was
favorable to the Hawaiians. An era».

of prosperity followed. Hawaiian
businessmen asked that Hawaii be

In 1898 Spain ceded Puerto Rico
to the U.S. In 1902 it became a
territory. "Today Puerto Ricans

These signiﬁcant historical facts
prove that Mr. Harris’ statements
are not true. Compassionate
Americans sent enlightened men to
distant lands to help and to serve.

Hot-Shooting Panthers Melt GW, 82-61

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer
No one thought it would be easy.
And in reality, "it wasn’t.
But when a basketball team makes
almost 80 percent of its ﬁeld goals,
as the Panthers did Wednesday
night against the George Washing-
ton Colonials, it evidently helps.
Pitt now leads the Eastern Eight

’ with a 3-0 league record after

beating GW, 82-61 at the Field
House.

Despite the absence of Panther
team scoring leader Sammie Ellis,
who is out with an ankle injury, Pitt
pressured the Colonials and their
ﬁne center Mike Zagardo into a
state of confusion and ended up
with three players in double

' ﬁgures. '

“I put defense ahead of my
offense," said junior transfer
Lennie McMillian, who produced a
season-high 16 points in his ﬁrst
starting role at Pitt.

Guard Dwayne Wallace also
collected 16 points, while Carlton
Neverson added 14 for the
Panthers. Neverson, in foul
trouble throughout much of the
second half, was effectively re-

of the

substitutute guards: John Ryan,

J Darrell Gissendanner and Scott

Grevey. /

Just about everyone expected
the game to be close, after all,
Ellis’ absence, Neverson and
center Sam Clancy's foul trouble,
plus the Colonials’ height advant-
age were to be considered. In the
end, Pitt outmuscled GW, 32-22 on
the strength of Clancy's 14
reboimds.

Clancy needed just eight points
in Wednesday's game to move onto
the Pitt top-ten all-time scoring list.
With 11:27 left in the contest he
achieved this in typical “Slam
Bam” fashion: a lofting pass from
Ryan was alley-ooped in a play that
brought the already-cheering fans
to their feet. -

“The crowd went wild and 1'

heard them. That’s when I knew I

” said
the 6-6 junior, who ﬁnished the

' game with nine points. ‘‘I never
thought I would be on the all-time
scoring list, but right now I just
want to contribute as much as
possible to the team.”

Clancy, experiencing a case of

the ﬂu, suffered chills after the
game, but earlier combined with

NEW YORK—-Willie Stargell,

knows how to get good position on
his opponent.
ﬁlms, we decided the best way to
contain him was to get in front of
him. Our defense was just great
tonight.”

The Panthers jumped out to early '

leads of as much as nine points in
the ﬁrst half, but saw the margin
dwindle to four at intermission,
39-35. For all intents and
purposes, however, the game was
over less than four minutes into the
second half, as the Panthers began
their amazing shooting exhibition.

By shooting almost 60 percent in
the ﬁrst half, Pitt ended up with a
.698- percentage «for the evening, a
feat easier said than done. Not
bad, considering nobody even said
it.

Through ‘the pounding stretch
drive of September, when the
Pirates were locked in a day-to-day
battle for survival with Montreal in
the National League East Division,
Stargell steadied the team. He
batted .281 for the season, hitting a
club-high 32 home runs and driving
in 82 runs, most of them crucial.

As important as his tangible
contributions were on the ﬁeld,
Stargell was perhaps more valuable
in the clubhouse. Heis captain of
the Pirates and the team looks to
him for leadership. He supplied it

First there were Stargell’s stars,
little gold, paste-ons which he
awarded to teammates in recog-
nition of their contribution, to the
team’s effort. The stars became
merits of honor that Pirate players
proudly pasted on their caps, a
tactic that apparently bound them
in pursuit of their goal.

Then Stargell and some of his
disco-loving teammates adopted a-
popular Sister Sledge tune, “We
Are Family," as the Pirates’
personal anthem. They felt the
words described the relationship
between the occupants of._the
Pittsburgh clubhouse. “We really
feel like we are a family,” Stargell
said. And if they are a family, then
Stargell is “Pops,” the senior
citizen who gave the family

Lady Hoopers Beat Raise Record to l 2-4   i 

By MARIEHUFF
Pitt News Staff Writer

The women’s basketball game
Wednesday night was a typical
Pitt-West Virginia contest. The
Lady Mountaineers never gave up,
but the Pantherettes walked away
with an 80-67 win. The victory,
Pitt’s third straight, raised their
season record to 12-4.

The Pantherettes jumped out to a

quick 12-3 lead before WVU knew”

what happened. The Mountaineers
then staged their first of two
short-lived comebacks as they
closed the gap to 35-31 at halftime.

Pitt came out in the second half
and rebuilt their lead to 14 when
West Virginia roared back.
Swishing the nets from 10 to 20 feet
out, the Mountaineers chopped the
Pantherette lead to four. -However,
the remaining-12 minutes belonged
to Pitt, as they led by 21 points at
one point in the game.

Penny Welsh scored 26 points,
aided by Debbie Lewis with 20.
Janis Drummonds was the high
scorer for WVU with 13 as ﬁve
Mountaineers hit double-digit ﬁg-
ures. ~ '

But Gail Aughburns was ob-

viously the player‘ of the night.’

Aughburns pumped in 17 points

while grabbing 15 rebounds and.

blocking two shots. _

“Gail was outstanding,” said
Coach Jean Balthaser. “She has
been consistently playing well, but
this game has to be her personal
best.” I ‘

The Pantherettes travel to New
York tomorrow to challenge
Queens College. Queens, ranked
sixth in the east, will have a
deﬁnite height advantage (their
tallest is 6-foot-7).

“We are really psyched for them
(0ueens),” remarked Balthaser.

“Currently we are ranked seventh,
and a big win would help us a lot.”

HOLIDAY FLASHBACK: After
opening their season with a 55-54
loss to Morehead State, the young
Pantherettes strung together a
record eight-game winning streak.
The streak included an upset
victory over Penn _State, marking
the first time Pitt has won its own
invitational.

her in second-place on the Pantherette all-tIme
scoring list. I

The ﬁnal win of the streak, an
81-71 decision over 17th ranked
(nationally) Northwestern, proved
to be disasterous for Pitt. Carol

Dugan, the Pantherettes’ shooting

guard (10.3 points per game this
season), was lost for the year with a
knee injury.

Stunned, Pitt went to the North
Carolina Classic two days later.
Coach Balthaser said, “We hadn’t

had time to mentally adjust to the
loss. Carol is a tremendous
defensive player. Losing her, we
lost size and- quickness.” The
result was a win over Northern
Kentucky sandwiched between
losses to Mercer and Indiana.
The Indiana loss, coupled with a
68-65 loss to fourth-ranked (nat-
ionally) Texas, are the only back-to
back losses this year’. ‘Wins over‘

3 Faces Big PSU Test

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer

While the women’s gymnastics
team is battling for position among
the nation’s_ top ten, the men will
be testing a young, but not
inexperienced squad against Penn
State, according to coach Frank
D’Amico. .

“We do have a young team and
while we may be considered
inexperienced on the collegiate
level, _these guys have had a lot of
other experience,” said D’Amico.
“About 95 percent of our team is *
made up of freshmen and
sophomores. ’ ’

The coach named senior team
captain Ken Lunds as one of the
all-around performers for the
Panthers tomorrow.

“Ken has really developed into a
good all-around gymnast,” said
D’Amico. “He has class, style and
grace, A and best of all, he is
consistent. ’ ’ '

The eighth-ranked Nittany Lions
should also have their hands full
with Bob Besong who is Pitt’s
number one man in the floor
exercise, high __bar and __ring_§,_

according to the coach.

“Bob could and should take all of I I

Penn State’s men in those three
events,” D’Amico said.

D’Amico said that the Panthers ..

have come a long way in the
sidehorse event which in the past

has been Pitt’s weakest, event, «
is one of,

Today, he said, it
the strongest. '

It is one of the strongest because '

of two specialists in the sidehorse,

Nooch Capani and Byron Johns.. V

The two have added much-needed
depth to the squad.
“Both Byron and Nooch have

worked real hard in the last year*.__ 

and have blossomed into strong
competitors,” said D’Amico. '
“When your sidehorse team is
strong, your whole team is good.”

The coach mentioned one fresh-
man walk-on performer who is

doing a good job and is a deﬁnite ' 5' I

asset to the team. He said that

David Schandelman, who works the .

rings, high bar and vaulting. is a
good name for the future. I‘

best in the school’s historyqand also

The classic match-up of Pitt-
Penn State, both nationally-ranked,
takes place again tomorrow at the
Pitt Field House. However, the
contest will be about as far from the
football ﬁeld as it can be when the
ninth-ranked Pantherette gymnas-
tics team takes on the second-
ranked Lady Lions.

Both teams are undefeated and
Pitt has nver defeated Penn State,
but the Pantherettes usually save

‘their best performances for the

' ‘Lions. Pitt ‘achieved their highest

iDurkin;
Speich, McGinley and Karen

score, and the highest in the
history of Pitt gymnastics last year
against State. Pitt’s highest score
thus far this season is 133.15 while

' the Lions have reached 136.65

According to Pantherette coach,
Donna Sanft, she and the team are
very excited about the meet. She
said it will be taped for a national
broadcast later in the year.

“We have teams and judges of
exceptional quality, so the scoring
should go pretty quickly,” she
said. “Also, if the meet is a great
success in the Field House, there is
always the possibility of future
meets there.”

Starting for Pitt in the all around
competition will be Holly Martino,
Bonnie Tressler, Roxanne Evans
and Babie Flock. Evans and Flock
are both coming off injuries and
Evans will be starting in her first
all-around for the season.

Other Pantherette competitors
are: in the vault, Gretchen Speich,

Vicki McGinley and Kathy Durkin;

in the uneven bars, Speich and
in the balance beam,

“The vault should be one of our

the best team I've ever coached,”
said D’Amico. “one thing that may
hamper our performance is. the
change in this year’s rules.”

That change D’Amico referred to
is that last year, the team score was
taken by adding together scores
from the top four out of six events.
This season, the team score will be
the top ﬁve out" of six. That,
according to the coach, will mean
the team with the most depth will
score the highest. V

“We are excited about compet-
ing in the Field House,” D’Amico
said. ‘ ‘It’s the first time there in 25
years.” .

“I’m expecting a lot out of these
guys and I think I’ll get it,” he
added. “This team has the best
attitude of any I've ever coached.
Our goals are for a top 20 finish and
to get a couple of the guys to I
nationals.” - . ‘ .

Students are reminded that
admission to all remaining Panther -
home basketball games will be by
ticket only. Student tickets can be
obtained through the Student Union
Ticket Office with university ID.
These transfer tickets must

admission to all games, including
the Duquesne and Duke contests,
which have been sold out to the
public. A limited amount of
transfer tickets will be available to
students before each game.

“Babie has the potential to be our
best vaulter. but because of her
knee injury, she will be hampered.
Right now, Holly is the strongest
vaulter with a team high score of
8.9.” .
According to the coach, Evans,
with an 8.9, is the best performer in
the uneven bars, while Bonnie
Tressler tops the team in both the
balance beam and ﬂoor exercise.
“Surprisingly, the beam is one of
our strongest events this year,”
Sanft said. “Last year, we had a

 

really hard time with that event.
We're hoping we can pull through
with a big score.”

According to the coach, the team
is looking for a score of 135. Last
season's high score of 133.4 was
also a Pitt record and she feels that
Pitt could conceivably top the
mark.

“If people would just come to see
this meet. I’m sure thev’ll be back
the rest of the season,” Sanft said;
“Once exposed to gymnastics, a
spectator. will usually be back.”

_ Experienced Women Gymnasts Host Penn State  

FINAL FLIPS: Pitt has two other
big meets in January including a
dual meet with 11th-ranked Michi-
gan State and the Windy City
Invitational which includes in its
field seventh-ranked Nebraska,
number eight Louisville and
12th-ranked Louisiana State. . .Penn
State’s Ann Carr is back after she
was out with an injury last season.
Reports are that she is once again
fantastic...Pitt’s Myra Bachuchin is
out with a knee injury and is
doubtful for the rest of the season.

  They Love Their Blue in Houston -Win, Lose or Lawsuit  

Love Ya Blue?

Anyone familiar with Terrible Towelism must
surely recognize the battle cry of the now—out-of-it
Houston Oilers. And while the AFC wild—card
team’s powder—blue, plastic Love Ya Blue cards were
but a small dot of pastel among a sea of black and
gold Sunday afternoon at Three Rivers Stadium, it
was obvious that Oiler Mania does not end with this
token of enthusiasm.

Texas, well-known for its “we do things big down
here” snobbery, is a state with a passion for football
in its two largest cities, Houston and Dallas. And
while Houstonians finally got the bragging rights in
Texas when the Oilers defeated the Dallas
Cowboys, the recent matchups between Houston and
Pittsburgh have also become matters of civic pride.
And when you talk about pride in_Texas, watch out.

T-shirts bearing the slogan, “If I’m good and say
my prayers, when I die, I’ll go to Texas,” can be

found in almost any T-shirt shop. This hubris, of V

course, extends to the Oilers. “And on the‘ eighth 1
day, God created the Houston Oilers,” is a popular V
slogan, while references to the team’s star running
back include: “God created all men equal, except for
Earl Campbell. ’ ’

  On the Run

. By MARIA SC/ULLO

 

The Love Ya Blue T-shirt had been a hot item all
during the playoffs. However, after Houston’s unex-
pected win over San Diego in the AFC semifinals, the
T-shirts became to Oiler fans what the Terrible Towel
is to this city. Houston radio station KILT even went
as far as to announce frequently, “Love Ya Blue time
is now...”, and the “Love Ya Blue weather forecast
1s...” . ‘

On the subject of weather, Houstonians gave more
attention to the Pittsburgh forecast during Steeler
game week than they did to the Houston weather
report. After last season’s slip-andlslide icebath at
Three Rivers, Oiler fans were praying for a warm
spell up North but were agitated daily to hear that it
was cold and snowing. Most fans seemed to agree

that weather would be a factor, with or without :1’

healthy Campbell or Dan Pastorini. _‘
But in the end, it was not the weather seemingly at

-Sunday,

/ ‘a

fault for the Oiler loss. A bobbled touchdown catch
(or was it?) in the third quarter will remain a point of
controversy among fans, at least until next season..

Last year, when Houston lost in the playoffs, the

team was greeted by 47,000 screaming fans. Last
55,000 Oiler fanatics crammed‘ the
Astrodome, with some 10,000 left outside. All this to

honor a beaten team. In 1978, when the Steelers lost’

to Denver, the airport was a fiaction of this. This
comparison is not to degrade Steeler fan support but
serves to emphasize the extent of Oiler Mania.

Of course, there is such a thing as carrying sports
loyalties a bit too far. William R. Pabst and Dianne
Simons have filed a federal court suit asking U.S.
District Judge Carl 0. Bue for a temporary restrain-
ing order and preliminary injunction against the
NFL, after the referees’ call of the bobbled pass play
seemingly cost the Oilers the AFC title. They would
like the Jan. 20 SuperBowl game stopped.

Houston is finished, at least for the 1979-80
season. But youscan bet fans will be singing along to
the opening chant from Lee Ofmann and Griditz’
Oiler fight song, ‘_‘Look out football, here we come,
Houston Oilers number one! ”, all winter, loving and
agreeing with it every minute.

The play is set around the turn of the century, for the most part in Pittsburgh, and it focuses on two

. dynamic women. Lillian Russell was one of the most famous actresses of her era and a legendary beauty.
Willa Cather was perhaps the first great woman novelist America has produced. Lillian led a comic-opera
life with four marriages and a notorious friendship with Diamond Jim Brady. Willa gave her heart to no man
and treasured the privacy afforded by a small circle of women friends. Their paths crossed in Pittsburgh,
where each spent a crucial decade in her life, and the city emerges as the third main character in the
play. A spectacular musical documentary in the tradition of Stee//City. ' I
