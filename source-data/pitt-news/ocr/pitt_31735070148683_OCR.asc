man offensive lineman Matt
Rotheram andjunior receiver

season—ending injuries in Pitt’s
35-20 win-overliﬂonnecticut at
Heinz Field. V .

“We are incredibly disap-
pointed for these three young
men,” Todd Graham said in a Pitt
press release. “They have put so
much work into our program,
and it’s heartbreaking to see
their seasons end prematurely.
Even from the sidelines, I know
they are going to remain impor-
tant leaders who ‘will continue
to make an impact as we strive
to reach our goal of a Big East
Championship.”

Ray Graham suffered a knee
injury on Pitt’s first drive of the
game and will need surgery.
He entered Wednesday’s‘game

For actors,job’s all in a night’s scare

Breanna Durham
- " A: For The Pitt News

Whenjeff Slagoe feared haunted
houses as a child, it was the ac-
tors that terriﬁed him.

Finally Slagoe decided enough
was enough. He volunteered to
do the scaring at Hundred Acres
Manor a few years ago, and he
has since conquered his fear. In
fact, he loved the experience so
much that he decided to make
it his_ day job‘. Now he’s thezone

manager and an occasional actor I

at Hundred Acres Manor, located
in Bethel Park, which concludes

~ its scaring season this Sunday.

Slagoe is one of about 150
staffers at Hundred Acres ‘Man-

or. The volunteers who do the
scaring range from 14—year—olds
to the middle—aged, and some
have been acting for years. The
actors take their jobs seriously,
putting hours into rehearsing,

slathering on makeup and put-_

ting on costumes —— allito pro-

. vide seconds of sheer terror for

their guests.
Domenick'Deutsch, whose
mismatched blue and brown
eyes glowed eerily from special-
effects contacts, started acting
at Hundred Acres with his high
school_drama club to raise mon-
ey for the charity. After acting
with the drama club for several
years, Deutsch decided to vol-
unteer on his own. But he said
that doesn’t mean hedoesn’.t still

get scared.

“I was walking by one of the
actors, and she scared the living
hell out of me,” he said.

Deutsch works at the haunted

house while attending the Art

Institute of Pittsburgh for digital
film and video production.

-- For Jenna Dobiek, a sopho-
more in high school, it’s all about
transforming into the physical
character. She usually dresses
up in ragged Victorian attire, but
her costume can vary depending
on what she is assigned to do
that night. A

“I absolutely love getting my
makeup done. Like when we’re
not open on weekdays, I will
come down here, and I will have

the main director do my makeup

personally because I love being
scary,” Dobiek said.

But those costumes aren’t
always comfortable. Putting on
makeup and costumes can take
hours because of the details,
which range from fake open
wounds and blood to intricate
costumes. ‘ A

Giuseppe Capolupo, also

known as the Gingerbread Man, A

has his own gauntlets made out
of aluminum sheet, rivets and
metal wiring.

He wears a mask that’s
hinged at the jaw and moves as
he speaks. That mask, a pair of
bright special—effects contacts
and an ever-changing accent —

Pitt’s campus reﬂects on

Danny Zaidi
Staﬁ Writer

After one of the longestwars in U.S. history, the
troops are coming home. “ _

Lastweek, President Barack Obama said that
American troops will be out of Iraq by Dec. 31,
in line with his campaign promise. But the deci-
sionwasn’t metwith unanimous praise. On Pitt’s
campus, the announcement proved divisive, as
ROTC students and a political science professor
contemplate Obama’s decision.

The announcement signiﬁcantly alters many
ROTC cadets’ expectations forthe ﬁxture, espe-
cially because they mentally prepared for the
possibility of being deployed to Iraq.

Senior Seth Kerr, a cadet S3 operations of-
ﬁcer in Pitt’s ROTC, said that during his fresh-
man and sophomore years, being deployed to
Iraqwas a “very real possibility.” Now, after the

ploying troops one or-two years after I gradu-
ate,” Kerr, a political science major, said about

Obama’s decision to continue to keep troops in '

Afghanistan. .
Other ROTC members said the decision
surprised them and that they feel there is still
work remaining in Iraq — speciﬁcally, having
American officers stay to help stabilize the Iraqi
political system.
Bryan Szczur, a junior Army ROTC cadet, said

he felt neutral after Obama’s announcement. ; j '
“At ﬁrstlthought, ‘OK, that’s good.’But   3

think we should have kept themtherle alittle bit.
longer. That’s why I was sort of conﬁised atﬁrst,”
the marketing major said.

Szczursaidthatwhenhejoinedtheprogram .

two years ago, he did not expect the U.S. to with-
draw from Iraq so soon.

Inhis address ﬁomwashington, D.C., Obama
said that the U.S. will continue to help Iraqtrain
and equip its forces, “justaswe offer trainingand
assistance to countries around the world.”

Obama said he will continue to work with

“We’ll partner withan Iraq that contributes

Actors switch personalities

Haunted < 1

British, but always deranged -—
make him a popular character at
the attraction, Capolupo said.

Capolupo, 24, began working
at the haunted house when he
was 13 because of his love for
the macabre. He develops his
characters from all of the hor-
ror movies that he’s watched as
a child.

“You get to completely change
the ball game, put on completely
gory costumes that completely
change your personality and
morph into this creature from
another galaxy and just have an
absolute blast with it,” Capolupo
said. He said a highlight of the
job is triggering visceral emo-
tions from the people who pass
through the haunted house by
getting inside their heads.

As guests stand in the line,
Capolupo gets up close and
personal as he creepsaround
them. When guests reach the
door to the haunted house, he
turns into a guide. As guests try
to find their way through the
haunted attraction, Capolupo
disappears and reappears when-
ever he pleases, often singing a
slow tune.

He said that he especially pays
attention to naughty children
who don’t have manners. About
two years ago, a little boydared
to use foul language and taunt

him. That night, the Gingerbread

Man found a target. . -

By the end of the night, he had
found the boy, revved up the-fake
chainsaw and chased the kid into
the corner until he was crying
and apologizing.

“Yep, that’s right — payback,”
he said jokingly. “Payback always

gets them, and I’m sure that lit- '

tle boy will remember me for a

veri‘.orm/ireiess A

FORGET THE

couple of years.”

Capolupo said that he doesn’t
want to torment people into
nightmares, but if they do have
nightmares, he’s doing hisjob.

“I’m actually one of the nicest
guys,” Capolupo said.

Hundred Acres Manor’s ac-
tors have varying reasons for be-
ing there and different stories to
tell. Many of them started out as
visitors and came back to work
for the haunted house, which do-
nates proceeds to the Homeless
Children’s Education Fund and

Animal Friends.

Ethan Turon, the special ef-
fects director and operations
manager, feels that the volun-
teers have to have a passion for
the industry and believes that
haunted houses have great po-
tential for business. He said that
working at a haunted house sets
him apart from people.

“You pick up a pen and could
write a book, I can pick up a
paintbrush and a machete and
scare the hell out of people,”
Turon said. I

SGB candidates kick
off election season    

Mary Mallampalli

Staﬁ Writer _

Seventeen students are officially
running for the 2012-2013 Board
—— 15 for the eight board member
positions and two for president
— although students may still ﬁle
for late candidacy up to one week
before the election. Three students
have applied for late candidacy for
Board positions so far, but their
names will not be released until

. they ﬁnish the process.

Current board members John
Hasley andjames Landreneau are
running against each other for SGB
president. .

Campaigning begins today, and
all candidates may solicit students,
receive endorsements, raise funds,
hang banners, advertise electroni-
cally and distribute T~shirts, ac-
cording to SGB’s election code.

Landreneau, a senior, said that
he wants to use these elections as a
continuation of his effort to create
a more approachable Board. Often,
he said, students perceive SGB’s
role as only allocating money to
student groups.

“But the rabbit hole goes a little
deeper than that,” Landreneau,
who wants to pursue a more trans-
parent Board if he’s elected, said.

. Hasley, a senior, said the best
part of campaigning is hearing
the many perspectives of Pitt stu-
dents. _

“I mean, you really don’t get

‘ that perspective any time in your

term because, you know, you’re not
out there, going to meetings with

, people as much. So you really get

to hear about what students want,

. and hopefully as you get elected,

that shapes your actions on Board,”

Paper campaigning, the phase
during which candidates are al-
lowed to distribute posters, ﬂyers,
buttons and stickers, begins Nov.
15 at midnight. The election starts
at 8 a.m. on Nov. 17.

Along with weighing in on a
fresh list of board candidates,
students will vote on a potential
change in the voting system. The
referendum will allow students to
vote for eight board members and
one president in next year’s elec-
tion. Currently, students select ﬁve
board members and a president.

“I have very high hopes that
[the referendum] will pass, I don’t
see why students wouldn’t want to
allow themselves to vote for eight
candidates,” Kari Rosenkaimer,
elections chair for SGB, said.

STICKING MY NECK OUT

Abortion bill costly, damaging

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

It’s been a had few months for
reproductive rights.

On Oct. 13, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed the “Pro-
tect Life Act” — sneer quotes
intentional ——- a bill which not
only bars women from purchas-
ing insurance plans that cover
abortion under the Affordable
Care Act, but also allows doctors
the option of denying lifesaving

, care to a pregnant woman if pro-

viding said care could harm the
fetus she’s carrying. As if that
weren’t enough, the Pennsyl-
vania House of Representatives
is expected to vote on Senate
Bill 732, which would require
freestanding abortion clinics
in Pennsylvania to comply with
Ambulatory Surgical Facilities
guidelines‘ — an insidiously
reasonable-sounding measure
that would close down every
freestanding abortion clinic in
Pennsylvania for extended peri-
ods of time and double the cost
ofthe procedure.

SB 732 is being billed as the
state government’s response to
the horrors unearthed in the
illegal Philadelphia abortion
clinic of Dr. Kermit Gosnell.‘
Gosnell is charged with the
murder of 41-year-old Karna-
maya Mongar, who died from an
overdose of anesthesia allegedly
applied by an unlicensed assis-
tant, andseven infants "whose
spines Gosnell, again allegedly,
severed with scissors after they
were born alive.

But despite what proponents
of this measure would have you
believe, pro-choice advocates
who oppose the bill don’t want
abortion to be unregulated, and
they don’t think what happened
in Dr. Gosnell’s clinic was OK —

not even close.

We are, however, aware of a

O few facts.

Fact 1: Abortion providers
in Pennsylvania already comply

with up to four different sets of -

guidelines, and‘ all the facilities
currently in operation have-been

praised for their high standards»

" *a-uw~.s'.s-e-.sw':\s$'gs'\-.s‘s_'n‘.wi~»-uaﬂw.-.’.

of safety and care.

Fact 2: Facilities that perform
other minor surgeries such as
oral surgery, foot surgery and la-
ser eye surgery are not required
to comply with ASF guidelines.

Fact 3: ‘ASF guidelines are
cumbersome, expensive and

_largely irrelevant to patient

safety in abortion cases. SB
732 would require freestand-
ing abortion clinics to as much
as quadruple the size of their
operating rooms and install
hospital—grade elevators capable
of lifting a small car, with no
proven safety gains to justify
these expensive measures. Some
clinics would have to relocate
to comply with additional zon-
ing requirements. And although
every licensed clinic has a regis-

tered nurse present when abor- ‘

tions are being performed, SB

_732 would require that an RN

be in attendance “‘at all hours
when patients are present.” This

means that all abortion care

facilities, many of which only
perform abortions one or two
days per week, would have to
hire an RN to oversee the regular
gynecological exams, STD test-
ing and birth—control consulta-
tions that constitute more than
90 percent of the services they
provide.

Fact 4: Because no public
funds can be used for abortion,
theycost of hiring a full-time RN
and installing a hospital—grade
elevator cannot be reimbursed
by Medicaid. ‘

‘Fact 5: SB 732 would likely
force” every freestanding abor-
tion clinic in Pennsylvania to
shut down until it redesigned
its facilities; in other states, this
has taken over a year. Because
they can’t bill Medicaid, the sur-
viving clinics would have to in-
crease the cost of an abortion by
up to $100_0. Milder versions of
SB 732 have permanently closed
all but four of the previously
safe-certiﬁed abortion clinics
in Texas and forced the only out-
patient provider in Mississippi
to turn away between 600 and
700 womenin the 18 months it
took to redesign the facility.

Fact 6: When safe abortion is
illegal, unaffordable or difficult

to access, women desperate to
end their pregnancies some-
times take matters into their
own hands. And these women
often die. The National Organi-
zation for Women website has a
page listing the names and bi-
ographies of some women —
largely impoverished women of
color — who died from botched
at-home abortions. They under-
took measures themselves either
because the procedure was out-

3 lawed or because they couldn’t

afford to go to a clinic.
But there’s one important
woman they don’t list.
Karnamaya Mongar, Gosnell’s
adult victim, was a refugee from
Nepal. Like most of his patients,

‘ she was a poor immigrant wom-

an with limited access to real
healthcare -— a woman with few
alternatives. In other words,
Gosnell’s “Women’s - Medical
Society”«is w_l__1_at jpeppjlewgurn
to when you make it difficult
for women whowant abortions
to get them legally  which is
exactly what the Pennsylvania
Senate is doing, in the name of
Karnamaya Mongar.

Here’s another fact: During
three inspections under Gov.
Bob Casey’s term, Gosnell’s
clinic was deemed seriously
flawed, yet no move was ever
made to shut him down. A doc-
tor at the Children’s Hospital
of Philadelphia even hand-de-
livered a complaint about his
practice to the Pennsylvania

7 Department of Health, and still

nothing was done. Gosnell’s ille-
gal operation wasn’t allowed to
continue because abortion regu-
lations weren’t strict enough; it
was allowed to continue because
the Department didn’t enforce
existing laws. And if you think
that fact is unrelated to the ma-
jority of Gosnell’s clientele being
penniless immigrant women 
well, that makes one of us.

If you want to keep women
safe, enforce the laws on the
books and avoid new restric-
tions that could shut down safe
and legally operating clinics. If
you still support SB 732, that’s
your right —— but please don’t
say it’s because you’re concerned

about womenfs health.I

If you’ve read the The Pitt News in the
past couple of weeks or if you saw the
giant banner hanging from the Cathe-
dral of Learning, you’re aware of the
late William S. Dietrich H’s $125 million
donation to our University. That money
is going to spur some serious changes

in our community, even if many of us '

won’t be here to enjoy them.

Of course, Pitt can’t spend Diet:rich’s
donation indiscriminately. In case Uni-
versity oflicials are taking suggestions,
however, the following is a wish list
ofUniversity-implemented initiatives
that any student could support.

More Fraternities

I don’t know about you, but ifI go
one block without seeing someone
wearing khaki shorts, a snapcap, the
latest Sperry fashion item and ahoodie
with Greek letters on it, I break down
and cry. A college campus can always
use more bros. Unforumately, only
about 10 percent of Pitt students are
involved in Greek life, so it’s time for
usto expand the number of fraternities
and sororities on campus. If nothing
else, it’ll give underclassmen another
basement ortwoto dance inon Thurs-

day, Friday and Saturday nights.

Letters to the editor

To the Editor,-

Mark Kozlowski’s Oct. 24 column,
“Capitalism still the most desirable
economic system,” is ﬁlled with inac-
curacies and untruths. The piece brings
nothing new in the attempt to discredit
socialism. His arguments have been re-
peated time and time again, and there
is no shortage of material available that

lreﬁites his many hollow claims.

Kozlowski references these stale
discredited arguments in an attempt
to demonstrate the failure of social-
ism, yet makes no attempts to seri-

ously consider _or address the failure ,

of capitalism.

Just last week, ﬁgures published
by the Social Security Administration
revealed thatarnajority of Americans

I earn near—povertywages. The median

incomefor2010 was $26,364, hardly
greater than the ofﬁcial poverty level
of $22,025 for a family of four.

The anti—capitalist sentiments of
the Occupy Wall Street movement

are not the result of some misunder-
standing of capitalism, as Kozlowski
insists. They are the result of an un-
derstandingthat capitalismhasfailed:
the realization that a system inwhich
so many face poverty and devastation
isﬂawed. _

The solution to these problems is
asystem thatworks in the interests of
the whole of society, not for the proﬁts
of a narrowrulingclass. This requires
thatfactories and businesses be placed

under the democratic control of the .

working class, and a guarantee of ba-
sic social rights such as the right.to
a well—paying job, quality education,
health care and housing. This is the
program of socialism, the alternative
to the capitalist system of overwhelm-
ing poverty and exploitation.

Sincerely,

Kevin Foley

To the Editor,

Contrary to what Mark Kozlows—
ki suggested in his Oct. 24 column,
the Occupyihmovement is not com-
promised of radical anarchists and
communists, but genuirie, law—abid-
ing, tax-paying Americans who are
simply quite alarmed at the growing
income inequality in our country.
Their aim is not -a total upheaval of
the capitalistsystem, but progressive
reforms aimed at ensuring a more
equal society — a necessity for a
healthy, functioning democracy.

Even if income inequality in this
country were merely a product of
skill and education disparities driven
by incentive-based opportunities,
would it justify the top 10 percent
of Americans earning an average
of $164,647 a year while the bot-
tom 90 percent earn an average of
$31,244? The fact of the matter is
that‘-incorrie inequality inthe U.S.

FOOTBALL

Sunseri steps up for Panther offense

Chris Fanelli

Staff Writer

It might have taken until the
eighth game of the season, but
Pitt quarterback Tino Sunseri
seems to have found his groove.
He passed for a career-high
419 yards against Connecticut
Wednesday night.

After star running back Ray
Graham went down with a knee
injury, which will require surgery
and keep Graham out for the rest
of the season, Sunseri adapted
quickly and led the Panthers to a
35-20 victory at Heinz Field.

“I was really pleased with
Tino and how he managed the
game —— 419 yards passing,”
head coach Todd Graham said
after the game. “That’s a good
night.”

.Sunser.i’s-419 yards set a,Hei—
nz Field record for a collegiate
quarterback and tied for fourth
in Pitt history. Former Panther
Rod Rutherford threw for 419
yards at West Virginia in 2003.

Sunseri’s previous career high

- was 307 yards passing against

Rutgers on Oct. 23, 2010. But
Sunseri didn’t realize he was
putting together a historic night
when playing on Wednesday. ‘

“As a quarterback, you’re just
trying to make sure you’re mov-
ing the ball down the field,” Sun-
seri said. “You can’t worry about
anything else.”

Ray Graham’s season-ending .

injury is a brutal blow to Pitt’s
offensive attack. Tailback Zach

Brown — more of a power run- _
ner than Graham —— must step _

up in his absence, but, perhaps
most importantly, Sunseri needs

to continue to playaswell as he.

did Wednesday night. ,

The passing attack just be-
came infinitely more important
to the Panthers’ chances for a
-Big East Championship. The of-
fensive line took a‘ hit as well,
as Matt Rotherain fractured his
ankle against‘th'e‘Hiiskies. The
injury requires surgery, and he’s
out for the year.

For the remainder of the sea-
son, the injury-plagued offensive

line must find a way to provide.

Sunseri enough time to make de-
cisions, and Sunseri must get rid
of the ball quickly and effectively
like he did against the Huskies.

This strong performance
comes after weeks of irregular
play that caused some to doubt
Sunseri’s ability to A play the
position as Graham switched
between Sunseri and backup
quarterback Trey Anderson
against Utah. During the bye
week between the loss to Utah
and Wednesday night’s game
against_Connecticut, the coach-
ing staff announced that there
would be no more quarterback

’ musicahchairs. Graham said the

Panthers would stick with Sun-

seri because he gave them“the_, _-

best chance to win.

-Sunseri stepped up and. de-

livered. .

' Thecoachesg’ plan to simpli-
fy the offensive scheme for the 

quarterbacks worked, as Sunseri
went from combining with An-
derson for just 50 passing yards
against Utah to putting up 419
yards against Connecticut.

“I think we were trying to do
too much stuff [before], and that

caused the problem,” Graham
said. “We simpliﬁed things.”

Entering the season, fans ex-
pected impressive offensive out-
ings from the Panthers. After. the
win over the Huskies, Graham
said Pitt’s performance exempli-
fied the kind of offensive attack
he’s used to seeing.

“I was surprised that [419
yards] was a record,” Graham
said. “We went back to the draw-
ing board, and some things I
thought really helped‘ him. The
rhythm was really important,
and I think we kept them off
balance.” 1 j

The simplified passing at-
tack let Sunseri spread the ball
around more than ever, andas a
result, seven‘ Panthers finished

‘with more than 35 yards receiv-

ing. By using a good mixture

‘ T of screen passes and crossing. .
, routes underneath, Sunseri set

up his wide ‘receivers in space
and let them make plays with

 their feet. And by checking down
I consistently, he avoided the ma-
 ’ jority of the sacks he took in pre-
 vious gamesand played smarter, ,
 simpler football.

The way Sunseri played

didn’t go unnoticed by his team-
mates.

“[Sunseri] played really well,”
wide receiver Mike Shanahan,
who caught both of Sunseri’s
touchdown passes, said. “He
gave us chances. You really can’t
say enough about him.”

Sunseri not only controlled
the game in the air; he also made
an impact on the ground. He led
the team with 40 rushing yards,
as he was able to scramble out of
the pocket and. make defenders
miss with an array of pump fakes
— fakes Connecticut had to take
seriously since he was throwing
the ball so well.

Sunseri also had an 8-yard
touchdown run on the Panthers’
first drive of the "game.

Because heresponded to his
dismal performance against Utah
and Graham’s» injury with the

. best game of ltisjcareer, Sunseri

showed that the Panthers could
still have a chance in the ever-
changing Big"Ea’st race.

And now that Graham’s _out
for the season,fit’ll be on Sunseri
to make surethe offense, puts

up the pointsv_*it needs tofl<‘eep

ABIG EASTBREAKDOWN

 

Cincinnati 

takes over
top spot

Roger Sepich
Staﬁ" Writer

Last week, I warned the West

Virginia and Rutgers football Q)

teams about their,__dangerous
Friday night road games. '

But in typical Big East fashion,
the teams still lost to Syracuse
and Louisville, respectively.

Only one team -— the Cin-
cinnati Bearcats — remains
undefeated in conference play,
yet seven of the eight teams in
the conference still believe they
have a decent chance of earning
the Big East’s BCS bid.

So with two more conference, 1

games on the slate thisweekend,
here’s my attempt at ranking the
teams in the ever- changing land-
scape that is Big East football:

1. Cincinnati — Being the only
team without a loss in the con-
ference is enough of an accom-
plishment to earn the Bearcats
(6-1, 2-0 Big East) the top spot
for the first time this season.
They’_ve beaten two of the worst

teams in the conference, Louis— 

ville and South Florida, but win-
ning is really all that matters in
the Big East. A touchdown for
clutch quarterback Zach Colla-
ros with 12 seconds remaining

gave Cincinnati a winagainst 

South Florida last weekend.
The Bearcats are guaranteed
to stay atztheptop of the stand-
ings because of their bye this
weekend. ‘

2. Syracuse — The 0range’s "

(5-2, 1-1 Big East) complete
domination of West Virginia in
their 49-23 upset is enough to up
Syracuse to the second spot in
my rankings. Quarterback Ryan

Nassib has been good all season, *1

but his performance last Friday
bordered on perfection. If the
Orange can prove last weekend
wasn’t a ﬂuke with a road vic-

tory at Louisville this Saturday, they will
make a statement to the entire conference
that Syracuse is a real contender for the
championship.

Friday night doesn’t look goodon the

ily should’ve won; Three turnovers and

I twomissed field goals cost them what I '

would’ve been a crucialvictory. Rutgers
gets the perfect opportunity to respond
this Saturday when it hosts West Vir-
ginia in a game that could go along way
toward determining who wins the Big
East this year. "

4. West Virginia — After spending most
of this season as the heavy favorites to win
the Big East title, the Mountaineers (5-2,
1-1 Big East) collapsed against Syracuse
Friday night and looked vulnerable offen-
sively and defensively. It might have been
a fluke, but West Virginia can’t play many
more games that way if it wants to go on
and win this conference. Fortunately for
the Mountaineers, they still determine
their own destiny. That could all change
if they don’t come away with a victory‘ at
Rutgers this Saturday.

5. Pittsburgh? After back—to-back of-
fensive debacles that resulted in losses
to Rutgers and Utah, the Panthers (4-4,
2-1 Big East) exploded for more than 500
yards and 35 points in an important win
over Connecticut Wednesday night. Pitt’s
inconsistency. remains a big concern, but
Panther fans will have renewed hope that
this season isn’t lost if quarterback Tino
Sunseri can repeat his career-high 419:
yard performance — despite running back
Ray Graham’s season-ending injury.

6. Louisville — Earlier this season, I

‘ wondered whether the Cardinals (3-4,

1-1 Big East) would win any games in the
Big East, but Charlie Strong’s team proved
me wrong with its 16-14 upset of Rut-
gers. I still don’t expect much from the
Cardinals moving forward, but this team
might still have a slim chance of pulling
off a few more upsets and sneaking into
a bowl game.»

7. Connecticut-:— The ‘Huskies (3-5,
1-21Big East) couldn’.t‘ back. up their win

over Sou-th 'Florida"with another upset .

at Pitt. Despite Connecticut being the

defending conference champion, its title-
chances are all but over this season and

even a bowl game seems like a stretch.

On the bright side, freshman running '

back Lyle ‘McC‘ombs rushed for 100 yards
for the fifth time this season at Pitt, and

he should be the Huskies’ go-to—guy for ‘

years t0 COIIIC.

8. South Florida — It only took the
Bulls (4-3, 0-3 Big East) three ‘weeks to
complete their seemingly annual first-
to—worst fall in the Big East standings.
Before Pitt demolished them, the Bulls
looked like real contenders for the con—

ference title. Losses to Connecticut and

then Cincinnati this weekend ended that
dream, and now a needed bye week will
give Skip Holtz’s team the opportunity to
regroup with the hopes of at least making
a bowl game this season.

Offensive Player of the Week: Ryan
Nassib, Quarterback, Syracuse - The
senior passer played a huge role in the
Orange’s blowout of West Virginia. Nassib
passed for four.touchdowns and ran for

game at Louisville this Saturday, it will
be Nassib’s job to make sure the Orange
don’t suffer a big letdown.

Defensive Player of the Week: Chandler
Jones, Defensive End, Syracuse — As im-
pressive as Syracuse’s offense was in that
game, its defense played a huge role in

limiting the potent West Virginia offense

tojust 23 points.Jones, who ﬁnished with
six tackles and two sacks in the game,
played a huge part in helping the Orange

put pressure on Mountaineer star quar-
terback Geno Smith all night.

Coach of the Week: Doug Marrone, Syr-
acuse — In his third year on thejob, Mar-
rone has done wonders with the Orange.
Taking over a once—proud program that
had become a perennial cellar-dweller,
Marrone has completed the turnaround of
Syracuse football. Last Friday’s win over
West Virginia surely was one of the most
memorable moments in recent history

for Orange fans.

What to watch for in week nine: Who 

can rebound? — Avoiding losing streaks
is crucial for teams expecting to win the
Big East and that is what both West Vir-
ginia and Rutgers must do this weekend.
Their matchup in Piscataway is easily the
biggest conference game of the weekend
and the winner will come out of the show-
down feeling a lot more conﬁdentvabout
its title chances.

Ray Graham stands on the sideline after
injuring his knee against Connecticut.

Rotheram fractured his left ankle and will
also undergo surgery. He played in every game
this season, starting against Utah at tackle and
against Connecticut at guard.

Saddler, who played in all eight games and
started seven, fractured his sternum following
a 40-yard catch in the ﬁrst halfthat helped set
up the Panthers’ third touchdown.

He ﬁnished the year with 19 catches for 207
yards —.— a 1o.9—yard average per catch — and
a touchdown. “I know each will attack their re-
habilitation programs with incredible commit-
ment and be back betterthan ever next season,”
Coach Graham said. “That’s the type of people
and competitors they are.”

The Panthers have now lost six total players
to season-ending injuries this year.

Sophomore safetyjason Hendricks and red-
shirt freshman wide receiver Salath Williams
both suffered shoulder injuries against Utah.
Senior offensive guard Chrisjacobson injured
his knee against Iowa.Jacobson could receive a
sixth year of eligibility if he’s granted a medical
hardship waiver.

The Panthers’ next game is Nov. 5 against
Cincinnati at Heinz Field. Kickoff is set for 7
