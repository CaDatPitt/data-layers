by LARRY PANSINO

A series of fellowship informa-
tion sessions sponsored by the
University "Center for Interna-
tional Studies and the University
Counseling Center will be held
March 27-29. The purpose of "Fel-
lowship Week" is to encourage
those undergraduates and grad-
uates with interest in these en-
dowments and the potential to
win them, to submit applications.

"We‘ve found that a lot of stu-

-.f"dents are not aware of the oppor-

tunities in fellowships." said Pa-
tricia Roberts of the Counseling
Center. "This lack of ‘knowledge
is due to faulty communications
between faculty and students. to
the bigness of the campus, and to
students’ misconceptions of the
quality of their education here at
Pitt.

“Many students have the mis-
conception that Pitt is~a second
class university, especially the
students who come here from
nearby homes. It's like an exten-
sion of high school for many of
them because they made no large
geographic move. Schools close to
home always look more inferior.

\ "Actually, students here are re-.

ceiving a very good education.
The quality is certainly up to the
standards of fellowship grantors.“

Roberts said requirements for
specific fellowships vary_ but a
quality point average (QPA) of
3.00 or better is necessary.

The most prestigious fellow-
ships prefer a QPA near.3.75, but
Roberts said these requirements
are somewhat flexible. Other fac-

, tors include motivation, prepara-

tion, recommendations, and suit-
ability for the individual program.

The first session is planned for
undergraduates. especially sopho-
mores and juniors. It is scheduled
from 2-4 p.m. in the Graduate
School of Public "Health auditori-
um.-

Dr. Robert Newman. chairman
of the University Committee on
National Fellowships, will advise.

grants will also be discussed.
The second session islimited to

_ graduate students. It will focus on

fellowships for study abroad.
Meechem, Steve Blank, and Carl
Beck will advise at this session
from 2-4 p.m. in the GSPH audi-

. torium.

The final session is a general
workshop
for the referral of any student to
the proper fellowship programs.
This session will be held from 11
a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Lower
Lounge of the Student Union.

Pitt Graduates Discusses

Airtorce Opportunities

College graduates who are join-
ing the Air Force today are look-
ing for military careers. accord-

‘ A ing- to T, Sgt. Dick Allen.

Allen visited the Pitt campus
with Lieutenant Glenn Rhoades. a
recent engineering graduate from
the University. Rhoades recently
completed his officer training and
is beginning flight school. He is
looking toward a possible career
as an astronaut.

' Rhoades and Allen discussed

, career opportunities for college

grads in the Air Force. These are
limited to flying jobs as pilots or
navigators as ROTC graduates
have swallowed up most of the non
flying jobs.

Officers will be giving up a $20..-
000 a year salary plus benefits if
they leave the service after their
normal tour of duty. This inspires
them to make a career of it.

The University has always been
a good source of recruits. Allen

said. Approximately 60 Pitt grad-'

uates enlist per year. Many. such

as Rhoades. join after being out‘

of school and faced with a tight
job market.

Rhoades sees a future in the
space program and is optimistic
about its continued life. Despite
cut backs, he feels that both gov-
ernment and private industry
have made such a financial com-

mitment to the program that the-

adverse impact on the economy
would _be too great if the space
program were to be discontinued.

With the defense budget possibly
dropping and technology improve-
ments allowing for space equip-
ment to be reused. the cost of the
program will decrease somewhat.
and more funds will be available
as well.

Rhoades earned his undergrad-
uate degree in electrical engineer-
ingand will attend flight, school

A seems unresponsive to problems

of the black and the poor. largely
resulting because of other law-
makers‘ ignorance of-those prob-
lems. -

“If they, white legislators, were
more aware of what your prob-
lems might be,” Said Sen. Free-
man Hankins, a 13-year veteran,
“if they had to live with it for
awhile they could understand
what you're facing and the prob-
lems you have to fight for in or-
der to achieve some type of equal-
ity or some type of necessary pro-
grams in the black community.”

Rep. James D. Barber. a legis-
lator for four years. says he reg-

. ularly invites white legislators to

his West Philadelphia home to
see the neighborhood his consti-
tuents live in. and to perhaps over-
come their blindness to black
problems.

,-"Many legislators just vote

against bills because they don‘t'

understand them .— what they're
for." Barber said.

If there was one good thing Hur-
ricane Agnes did it was to show
legislators the daily living condi-
tions in which many ghetto blacks
live, Barber said. “We have three
Agnes’ everyday,” he said. “Now,
quite a few of them understand.”

There are 12 blacks in the 252-
man legislature—10 in thellouse
two in the Senate. All are Denic-
crats and all from Philadelphia
and Pittsburgh. Blacks comprise
about eight per cent of the state's
population.

Thus. trying to pass legislation
aimed primarily at helping poor
‘blacks or whites is not an easy
task. the blacks said.

Hankins tells of legislation be
sponsored that would prevent an
insurance company from can-
celling fire or home owners insur-

ance of persons indiscriminately-

only because the whole neighbor-
hood is considered a bad risk. It
failed to pass, he said,- because it
primarily “covers an area like
mine’f’t—predomina_tely black and

poor. I

"Legislators don't know the im-
portance of legislation like this
because they don't deal with it
everyday." Hankins said. "‘So
they have a tendency to be some-
what against it.“

The blacks also mention hous-
ing. education, prison reform. and
youth. as issues the legislature
does not deal with head-on be-
cause they‘re largely black prob-
lems.

In an effort to present their side
of an issue, the blacks formed a
Black "Legislative Caucus, count-
ing on strength in unity. But in-
fighting between the ‘.‘old-guard”
and the younger _ more activist
members has hurt any chance for
success.

The split shows the diversity

Draft Resisfer Kendall Speaks of Prison Term

by KARL BALDYS
"Whats interesting is that af-
,'ter burning my induction papers,
fl getting a lawyer. going to court,

A -and finally to jail, no one has sug-
gested to me that the war is just."

I said Timothy Kendall.

 ' Kendall stopped at the Intercul-
rgt.-;~-.ii House on Dithride St. to talk
with some of the members about

, l-.'::. recent two year tour of duty

1 in a federal prison in Allenwood.

f ,i»._"a. The crime he committed was

i}=ir'elﬁusal to enter the armed forces.

vi — Question: Why didn’t you leave

-. the country?

 . ‘Answer. Kendall: Well, I don't

3, ’tli”mik' leaving thecountry would
have accomplished anything. at

(p.lcast that's. how I felt about it at

- the time. I think I could have ap-

. plied for conscientious objector
statusand gotten it.

iv’_»‘4At thelitime he was called for ‘

"".the .draft.. Kendall was a Universi-
..ty of Notre Dame theology stu-
' -dent. He was active in what he
called the "Catholic Left" and felt
ifma. kind of kinship with the Berri-
. igans, and  . A. the priests and sis-
'_.ter's who were speaking out
A. against the war.“

He decided while still in college
that the draft was unfair. As he
put it, “I think it’s obvious that the
poor are the first ones to go. I
realized that a 2S deferment was
the only thing keeping me out of
the draft and in a sense I was
paying for it.” So Kendall tore up
his draft card and waited.

About the middle of his senior
year. the draft board sent him a
reclassification. He refused to
honor it and handed the envelope
back to the postman marked "lic-
turn to Sender." _

“As a theology major I saw it
as a moral responsibility to act
rather than to consider the war

and the draft. merely an academ- ,

ic exercise.” Kendall added,
“That doesn’t mean I condemn
people who submitted to the draft.
I feel sorry for those who didn’t
stop to think about it.”

Eventually thedraft board sent
him an induction notice. He public-
ly burned the letter. after reading

' it, in front of aecrowd of about 150 .

people.-

Several months later.. on grad— .

uation day. his mother told him
Federal agents were looking for
him. So. he went to his hometown

officials and was immediately

arrested.
Q: Did you feel a part of some
kind of movement, any political

group?

Kendall: Only on the periphery.
It was a political protest. but I felt
a moral obligation. At the time I
was taking part in a seminar on
non—violence and felt that could
effectively bring about change
politically. I was on the fringe of a
group called the Coalition for. Po-
litical Action. . . . In a real sense.
“The Movement‘ hasn‘t been a
cogent force for several years."

Kendall spent most of his two
year sentence (commuted from
four years by the sentencing
judge» at the minimum security
prison in Allenwood. But that was-
n’_t the only jail he had been kept
in.

"‘I spent about a week in the
Washington, D.C., jail. . . . Crowd-

ing, filth, cockroaches, rats, vio-'

lence, that’s how I’d describe it.
I was physically assaulted there
for refusing a homosexualand he
messed upmy face a«little.”

He continued. “Racial tension
inprisons is at fever pitch at all
times. A riot could break out any
time and the other guys knew that.
So. when they saw a one on one
fight. they left it alone." '

He also spent some time in
Lewisberg. "I expected to be har-
rassed there. especially after my

stay in D. C. But. there really
wasn't much of that at all. Al-
though. I think a lot of people
would be surprised at the political
attitudes of the prisoners. Most
of them were pro-administration
on the war. as well as domestic
policies. I guess they figured ‘I

had to get off my ass and steal. ..

what's
else.“

wrong with everybody

Phil criticized the ineffective-
ness of the parole board. He said
the board was run from a central
boardjin Washing-ton and that one
was inadequate for the number of
prisoners. '

He said the jails were over-

crowded and generall._v unclean.
"Drugs were prevelantﬁl saw
more marijuana in there than I
ever saw on the street.

He talked about violent crime
as if it were an everyday part of
prison life. especially coupled

with sexual assault. In general.‘

normalized channels for com-
plaints were ineffective.‘ "Going
to them with your problems was
a waste of time.

7 Q:-What will you do now: Do
you think this will seriously ham-
per your career?

Kendall: I just got out a few
weeks ago..Right now I'm travel-
ing to see some relatives and
friends. Eventually I'lll apply to
music school. I've always wanted
to study music seriously. In the

arts I shouldn’t be as inhibited as
in other fields. I cou1dn,t.go into a
profession now, like medicine or
law. But I think it was worth it. I
don‘t think I.could live with my-
self if I hadn't done what I did. "

Letters to the Editor

The Man Advantage

_ . Editor, The Pitt News:

article “The Man Advantage” by

Bart Mack which appeared in

your paper this past Wednesday. s

In myopinion, this is the poorest

 a‘ matter of fact, Armstrong

 f_l,ias, from time to time, officiated

-The "statement concerning Arm-

one towonder whether the Pan-

‘  is no less childish. Jim Armstrong

As to the complaints of the high

 an inherent trait of these juvenile

Walk for Dollars

Editor, The Pitt News:

On March 10, 1973, Phi Kappa
Theta fraternity and Delta Delta
Delta sorority walked from West
Virginia, along route 50 to Market
Square in downtown Pittsburgh.
The walkers were sponsored by
Pittsburgh businessmen.

The money raised, over $1,000,
will go to the Kidney Foundation

of Western Pennsylvania. This-

money will be used to treat kidney
disease, which is a major killer
among young people between the
ages of 20-30 years of age. This
drive is part of a major effort on
the Pitt campus by the Greek sys-
tem for the Kidney Foundation of
Western Pennsylvania.

Special thanks goes to Bobby‘s

No ‘Puritan Ethic

Editor, The Pitt News:

I recognize a person's right to
disagree with my recent excori-
ation of the smoking menace.
However, I think the writer'of
the letter signed “Joe -Caneitz"
went beyond "mere -dissent when
he implied that my news pro-
grams are inferior and alleging
that I practice perversion. I‘m
proud of my newscasts and give
my best effort toward providing
the WPGH audience with a con-
cise,. complete and well—delivered
report of the events making news-
on Monday. Wednesday, and Fri;
day at 9:30 a.m. I write all my
own copy, while other newscas-

ters at our station simply read '

whatever comes from the wire
service.

I also take issue with the asser-
tion that I "have “Puritan hang-
ups." The writer obviously doesn-
n‘t know me very well, or he
wouldn't have made such a state-
ment. My opposition to smokers
practicing their habit in such a
way that it disturbs others is not
based on Puritan philosophy. I
contend that smoking is a health

‘problem in our society. and the

odor and litter smokersgoroduce
revulses more people than only
myself.

The writer chose the venue of
personal attack rather than raise
an honest disagreement with the
judgments and information I pre-
sented. Only when he suggests
separate classrooms for smokers
and non-smokers does he come

close to a concrete .suggestion. I:

also ask why he should be allowed
to smoke in a classroom because

his cognitive functions are en-

hanced, while for other people,
cigarette smoke may have the op-
posite effect. ’

Finally, the writer did not have
the courage to sign his own name.
“Joe Caneitz” is a pseudonymn, I
believe, for someone on the Legal
Awareness Committee, which I
regard as a- responsible organiza-
tion, or at least I thought they
were. I hope in the future people
will use the Pitt News to debate
issues as opposed to unsupport-
able personal attacks.

Roughing the
Quarterback

Editor, The Pitt News:

Football is a bruising game, and
even gifted quarterbacks are not
immune to the bone-racking tac-
kle if they linger too long with the
ball. The rules of the game de-

mand that the on-rushing line— .

backers cease their pursuit when
the quaterback has disposed of
the ball. The penalty for breaking
this rule is 15 yards and a first
down.

Perhaps this same rule should
apply to the rush President Nixon
has recently put on Pete Rozelle,
the commissioner for the National
Football League. The administra-
tion implied that if the NFL didn’t
modify its home game blackout
policy, during the recent ‘cham-

pionship playofffs, it might get-

creamed in the courts or in the
Congress. More specifically. the
administration would not disap-
prove of legislation taking away
the NFL’s exemptions from anti-
trust laws.

Most fans would probably cheer
the President’s attempt to put
their teams in action on TV, and I
think that a hard look is warrant-
ed at the antitrust privileges that
sports club owners enjoy. How-
ever, hitting Pete Rozelle after TV
viewing schedules were com-
pleted is similar to roughing the
passer. Perhaps_ it would be a
judgment call, but it’s possible
that the Pennsylvania Ave. line—
backer should get a penalty flag
on this Christmas blitz.

McGee Replies

by RALPH DEAN-
Dear Ellen Ganley:

When I read your letter (article) addressed to Jeff McGee in Mon-
day’s Pitt News I became amazed at the number of points on which
yourand Jeff actually agree; Jeff’s ruminations on women’s lib wa_s
meant to point up some of the trivialities and annoyances which have
been created, perhaps unintentionally, as by-products of that move-
ment. V ,

You couldn’t find a justification, beyond his, for the linguistic hor-
rors he mentioned. (The suffix—person, the title “Ms.,” etc.) The self‘-

confidence of the female is going to rise only as women achieve the’

real progress socially that is their right. Any gimmicky nonsense such
as this word-play that occurs along the way to that goal will have .little
effect compared to that justified pride. ‘

Jeff’s position on equal employment is yours almost to the letter.
As you both say, ability will always be the only justifiable employ-
ment criterion. The Equal Rights Amendment issue is just as agree-
able'a point it seems. ' ' '

The reason Jeff did not go into the ramifications of women’s lib’s
effect on family life is simple. He didn't (doesn’t) understand it. No
one can yet. Experience will provide the only answers here, as there
are too many variables to make predictions accurately. At least Mc-
Gee did not draw conclusions on the subject as the optimistic libbers
have (they dismiss biology altogether) or as the more radical males
have (they dismiss the power of social necessity).

It is obvious to the readers of your article (letter) how I know-so
mucli about Jeff McGee’s motivation and opinions. It does not matter
that you broke an old journalistic tradiion in violating the pen-name.
I would like to try to explain why it was used.

People become defensive and reactionary when confronted by
something they don't wholly understand, especially if that thing is as
potentially powerful as women’s lib is.- This thing is a gut-reaction is-
sue for males as well, remember. My cynical tone (which is your pri-
mary objection) is born from this reflex. . »

’ This was the first time that I have ever used a pen name. It is also

the first time that I have failed to be sure that my opinions and meth-
ods were justified. No coincidence, believe me.

Don’t construe this as an apology, however. Far from it. Your ,

letter was printed because it“ was one of the few replies (that I saw,
anyway) that did not use rather disgusting language and innuendo, and
did not resort to pitiful cliches and stereotypes.

The articles, and the replies especially, taught me a big lesson.
That rhetoric works both ways. And that there are reactionarys on
both sides of every ‘,‘issue.” They (the replies) have removed a little
of the guilt I feel_when I take a look at my own hangups. I'm not alone
in having them.

All causes and arguments are only as perfect as the people who
formulate them. When we realize this perhaps we will be able to take
our crusades a little less seriously, and by so doing bypass the emo-
tion and get right to the important points all such matters raise.

Loggins&/vlessina, Croce
Bring Down the House

by BARBARA GERAUD

Ken Loggins and Jim Messina played to an almost-sold-out Syria
Mosque on Wednesday and nearly succeeded -in bringing the house
down with their good-time rock ‘n’ roll.

Kenny came out first—he and an unamplified Ovation acoustic-
doing “House at Pooh Corner,” “Danny’s Song” (which he wrote for
his brother Danny’s baby), and “Long Tailed Cat.’_’ He has a much
more soulful voice than is evident on the records; more raw‘ emotion.
and a great yodel.

Then came the rest of the band: Larry Sims on bass, Al Garth on
fiddle and horns, Jonny Clarke on bass, and Merel Bregante on drums.
And, of course, Jim Messina, looking skinnier and much happier than
when he was playing with Poco. It was obvious he feels better about
this association than the piror one, though he doesn’t deride Poco; he
just outgrew them. . .

They bounced (literally-——nobody stands still in this group) right
into Jim’s “Listen to a Country Song,” followed by “Holiday Hotel,” a
love song to the Holiday Inns of America. ' _

“Angry Eyes” was next, much longer than the album version, and
with some harmonies reminiscent of early Buffalo and Poco sounds,
sending chills up the spine. It wasn’t an improvisational number, yet it
came across that way, a tribute to the group’s talent. Everybody got

. to do their solo bit, with Jonny Clarke’s electric flute shining brightest.

“Back to Georgia” and a new song, “Walkin’ Out the Door,” came
through quite rockin.’——Kenny bouncing around the stage like a nerf
ball. , I ‘

Then came the/biggie—“Triology” (“Make a Woman Feel Want-
ed,” “Vaheevalla,” and “Peace of Mind”), off their first LP. An ex-
quisite series number, it can’t be described by mere words——a big jam-
up, and mind—shattering harmonies on “Peace of Mind.” It had to be
heard to be believed. .

’ Opening the show was Jim Croce, doing basicallythe same show

‘ as last time, only with more emphasis on the rockier numbers, out of

deference to the obviously L&M-influenced audience. Establishing.an
excellent rapport with the audience, he and his guitarist, Maury Mueh-
leisen (who does a great stock-car imitation) did a solid, tight set, do-
ing songs from both his albums. ’

by VINCE: Di NARDO'
._ > Sports Editor
i_History's most renown writer to this day. Wil-
liam Shakespeare once wrote about a Soothesayer
if-aman obsessed with the date of March 15—in the
l,‘ay)jJulius Ceaser. This noble gentleman. white

»,-beard_»an all.’ made a ‘habit of informing Ceaser.
’the once powerful Roman Emperor. and the lesser

subjects of that once untouchable empire to "Be-
ware of the Ides of March."

Memories On ‘The

this one." he encouraged.

Now I'm not really a male chauvenistic what-
ever. but curiousity won out.

stranded Arizonian who was making a living dancing

After a brief chat a deal was made. She would ‘I

The catch being that the drinks were a mere $2.50
per.

,Well. I was a tourist on this sunny Friday af-

-ternoon wasn't I?

Not to be forgotten was the fact that I was to do ‘
.a job and that wasn't the easiest thing to do. The
Pitt football team waited til I got here to have the-

worst record" in its long history. And, only once did
I make a trip and come back witha winner.‘ That
was theflast trip—Penn State basketball game,-One
thing I found out, it is absolutely no fun covering a
losing team. More reason for the New Orleans epi-
sode. ‘ -

Despite this. I did my best to leave my mark.
How many sportswriters do you know that were
thrown out of the Notre Damelocker room by the
mighty Ara Parsegian? Me. I -

It happened like this: The Irish had just de-
feated the Panthers. 42-16. and Parsegian had tak-
en every opportunity to run up the score.

The reporters were busy asking Parsegian to
compare his stars and to tell them “how good this
kid from Ohio was.” After a lowly collegiate re-
porter asked Ara to analyze the game he was told:

"‘I don’t analyze games until the next day.”

' Here’s how the conversation went from there:

Collegiate reporter: “Coach Parsegian. how
did Pitt stack up against some -of the other teams
you‘ve played this year." , - —

Parsegian: “I don't compare teams either."

1.1.. of Mm.»

Well.

Collegiate Reporter: "Mr. Parsegian. .why
were you passing the ball with a 20 point lead and
five minutes to go in the game?“

Parsegian: "If you're trying to say we ran up
the score you’re wrong. Cliff Brown——the quarter-
back—hadn‘t done much passing and we wanted to
see him throw the ball. We were just running basic
plays.” '

Collegiate Reporter: "Is the double reverse one
of the basic plays at Notre Dame?“

Parsegian: "Who are you ’anyway?"

Collegiate Reporter: “I‘m from the Pitt News
in Pittsburgh. -
*Parsegian:"I thought so. would youtmind_leav-
mg.” I ' A

‘Of course. the whole year wasn't this much fun
(?).. During the course of the year. I spent c-lo_se to
350 hours working on the Pitt News—at ‘48 cents
each. And. I became tired of being called Victor. I

was always introduced as the sports editor of the"

Pitt News Vic . . . Victor. . . . Ah. yes Vince Di Nar-

do. All along I thought I was Vince Di Nardo. . .
sports editor of the Pitt News. Oh. well.

But with all the travel and all the learning. I

,had only to listen to former Pitt assistant coach

Bill Quinter to learn what my job was all about.

“Vince,” Quinter told me once, “to be a good
sportswriter, you’ve got to have big ones”—Quin-

. ter meant that it takes a lot of nerve.

_ To be truthful. I was to frightened at first to be
interrogative and it took me awhile to find out that
you can be friendly and frank at the same time. As
the year progressed the fear disappeared the job
became much easier. Why just the other day I look-

ed basketball coach Buzz Ridl in the eye and was ' L
. able to say. "Coach. if I can get. sensitive for a min-

ute, I’d like to ask you if you plan to be back as
coach next year?"

It’s been real.

just involves getting used to the

Pitching is an area where Lew-I
is has many prospects, and isn’t

of help from Mike Fedoris and
Al- u-Sylanski,” said Lewis. "A1
had a sore arm most of last sea-

be one of our top pitchers.”

The catching chores will be

handled by Guy Caporelli and

Pete Martorelli. “Caporelli, who
is a righthanded hitter, will pro-
bably play against lefties, and
Martorelli, who°bats lefty, will

play against righties,” said Lewis. A

“For now though, I just hope
the weather stays nice." he con-
cluded. ‘

At
Crossroads

by LYNN HARRIS

The fate of the Pitt gymnastic team is ver_y indefinite right
now. It's future depends on the replacing of six graduating sen-
iors with twice as many high quality recruits and thefinding of
a new head coach. as Warren Neiger has announced his retire-
ment.

Posting a~0—1O record this season. brings to mind another

athletic sport here at the University.
are different. _
. Unlike other sports here at Pitt the problem lies not only in
quality but in quantity. For gymnastics. one needs at least three
athletes competing in every event. Many times this year Pitt
has not had three competing and the opponent has had the reg-
ular three to five man team. To say the least this has hurt Pitt
immensely. ~'

But the circumstances

An example of this lackgof depth is clearly /illustrated in the
meet with Springfield in‘ which only two events had more than

two participants, those being floor exercise and pommel horse.
“As for quality, the team had a great deal of potential b/utit never

reached its peak until the last meet of the season with Army.

The solution to the problem is part financial and part ad-
ministrative. To sum up the financial end. the team has asked
for very little money in the past 10 years and since it is a minor

spprt here at the ‘University, has received little from the athletic _
department. -

The administrative part of this problem is very interest—'
ing. Never until this year under the able leadership of assistant
coach Ig Perez has- their been a file of recruits. Traveling all

over the East, Perez has come/up with a list of "outstanding pos- ~

sibilities. Many of the prospective candidates are from rgight
here in Western Pennsylvania, something new and different
from previous years.

After seeing the problem one asks himself “Why'hasn't

 ‘something been done?" This season is not_ unique. Since 1963
I ‘the Pitt gymnastic team has compiled a 3-7? record in ECAC
I ' meets. In any other athletic sport something would have been‘

done long before this.

What exactly is being done to alter the situation?
 Besides enlarging the scope of recruiting, measures have

V, been taken to set up a fund raising drive. It will be aimed mainly
at the slumni. This, too, is under the leadership of Ig Perez.

In addition, the athletic department must now make a de-

. »cision. Who will replace Neiger‘? A list of prospective candi-
‘ . dates has been compiled and among those people is Perez. Perez
_ 1' has been coaching five years. three at Army and -two at Pitt. He
4  is the first and only assistant gymnastic coach at Pitt..

_ The contributions he has made to the team include the con-
j verting of a storage room into an exercise room for the team.

 

' the ‘setting up of an AAU meet at Pitt. for later this month to at-
I tract interest in gymnastics in the surrounding area. plus his

work with recruiting and raising money for scholarships. These
are just a few of his endeavors. If he gets the job as head coach
-3" 7' there will be major changes made in the program.

 - To sum it up: Ig Perez has been the backbone of the Pitt
" jfgymnastic team since he came here. He can play an integrals:

; part in the building of a winning gymnastic program. I endorse
  Perez for the head coaching job. His knowledge of the sport and

 
 

 of the athletic department.

BART MACK
New Associate

During his career as a Pitt
News journalist Siegel has cover-
ed women’s ‘basketball, tennis,
JV football, and JV basketball.
Mack has covered intramural
eventsgsoccer, and hockey for
two seasons.

Siegel sees few major changes
occurring during his administra-
tion. "There probably won't be
too many innovations this year. I
think that the sports pages in the
past few years have been handled
well.

“We will, however, endeavor to
present all the sports news,” con-
tinued Siegel. “But this will de-
pend on the number of new re-
cruits we get at the paper. Lack
of writers has been a major prob-
lem for the Pitt News for the last
yearf’

The new editors are wished the
best of luck in their attempt to
carry on in the tradition of their
