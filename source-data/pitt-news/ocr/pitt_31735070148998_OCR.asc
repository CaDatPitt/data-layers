Bob teat case focuses on transgender couple

The FBI issued a subpoena on
Thursday to a transgender.individ-

ual who was expelled from Pitt in

January in connection to the string
of bomb threats on campus.

Seamusjohnston, previously a
computer science major and hon-
ors student at Pitt—Johnstown,
and his partner, Katherine Anne
McCloskey, 56, will be appearing
before a federal grand jury today
at 9 a.m.

FBI agents Karen Talarom and

I Kenneth Buford knodked on the

door of the couple’sJackson Town-
ship home and began a three—hour
period of questioning regarding
the bomb threats at Pitt. The next

day the agents separately served ’

the couple with subpoenas.

The subpoenas asked the pair,
who both work for the Social
Democrats — a socialist party
that also advocates for LGBTQ
rights — to provide ﬁngerprints,
handprintings and handwriting
samples to allow for comparison
and analysis.

“I ﬁgured they just wanted to A

talk, so I was very surprised when
they came back the next day and
said ‘We need your ﬁngerprints,
we need your computer, we need a
handwriting sample’ — that totally
ﬂoored me. You have no idea what

this feels like,”Johnston, 22, said, ~

adding that he is surprised the FBI
is investigating him. _

The agents also asked the in-
dividuals to voluntarily surrender
Johnston’s personal laptop as well
as McCloskey’s work computer.
McCloskey refused to hand over
the Social Democrats’ computer,
and Johnston also did not freely

give his laptop.
' Johnston said the couple re-
fused for a multitude of reasons --

the company computer contains, ’

conﬁdential membership ‘lists and
McCloskey demanded a warrant
before releasing the computer.
“On top of all that, it’s private. It
may come across as being selﬁsh,
but there isn’t anything for them
to ﬁnd. I’m not saying screw what’s
happening on main campus,”John—
ston said. “I’m worried for them.

Police chase
endsln
Oakland har

By Andrew Shull
Assistant News Editor

Crista Santucci thought it would be
a quiet Monday night behind the bar
at Pittsburgh Cafe.

But that changed when Pitt police

' and city police arrested a man in the

bar’s bathroom for stealing a car.

City police conﬁrmed that they,
along with Pitt police, made an arrest
at Pittsburgh Cafe after 9 p.m. Mon-
day night for auto theft but wouldn’t
release the name of the man they
arrested.

Rob North, the head of security
for the bar, was there for quiz night,
though he wasn’t working. He said
a man walked into thebar, patted
somebody on the back and walked
into the second ﬂoor bathroom.

Santucci said the man was “cor—
dial, cool and collected” before the
police came in asking Santucci if a
man matching his description en-
tered the bar.

North said oncethe police came
in, he got everyone out of the bar
except for himself and Santucci,
and the police placed the man who
had entered the bar earlier under
arrest.

“It was a very quick process,”
North said.

Shortly after, business resumed
at the bar.

Santucci said that unfortunately
for the man who police arrested,
he just missed the bar’s back exit,
which could have been a possible
getaway.

“He was two feet away from it
when he Went upstairs,’7 she said.

An anonymous bomb threat target-
ing Belleﬁeld Hall, Belleﬁeld Tower
and the Cathedral of Learning was
delivered to the email address of a

local reporter on Saturday at 2:25

p.m. . ., I - l . . _
But breaking with normal pro -
cedure, the University didn’t send
out an Emergency Notiﬁcation Sys-
tem alert.

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill said
in an email that the case of inac-
tion in regard to the alert was not a
change in policy by the University,
but rather it was incongruence be-
tween the time
that the threat

or weekend threat

Belleﬁeld Hall was asked to leave .

that building while the search was
underway, and no one was permit-
ted to enter either building until
the searches had been completed,”
Hill said.

. Rumors of the potential unre-
ported threats prompted people
to take to blogs gsocialmedia

" sites such as Reddit  on

Sunday. Commentators cited the
Pitt Police scanner and second and
third—hand accounts of the threats

‘ within their posts on the message

boards.

One commentator claimed that
several people were in the Cathe-
dral when the threat was received
and that the building was locked

. down, instead
of evacuated,

was issued and
the time that
University offi-
cials were noti-
ﬁed. The email
containing the
threats was not
forwarded to the

“So basically
that was another
hoax 

and students
were not al-

leave.‘

J Hill said
that this was
not the case.

“ N e ith e r

University until

8:50 p.m., nearly six and a half

hours after the email" was initially

received. »
“Because so much time ha

passed since the initial receipt of

the threat, it was not considered
to be imminent, and a general ENS
message was not sent,” Hill said.
Hill said that once the Universi-
ty had received word of the threats,
University officials promptly fol-
lowed basic procedure in clearing
the targeted campus buildings.
Since Belleﬁeld Tower is not a
Pitt facility, the University immedi-
ately forwarded the threat against
it to the owner of the building.
“The two Pitt buildings targeted
by the threat, Belleﬁeld Hall and
the Cathedral of Learning, were
immediately searched, and no evi-
dence of explosives of any type was
found,” he said.
Hill said that neither the Cathe-
dral nor Belleﬁeld Hall was heavily

‘ occupied Saturday night, which

aided in the speed of the completed
searches; however, some people
were asked to evacuate.

“A musical group practicing in

building was
‘locked down’ in the sense that
anyone was denied the right to
leave the building,” Hill said.

This weekend was not the ﬁrst
time that Pitt did not send out /an
ENS alert after receiving a bomb
threat. . .

During an interview on WPTS
last week, Hill saidthat on April
3, Litchﬁeld Towers received its
ﬁrst bomb threat, sent to the Pitts-
burgh_Post-Gazette at 2 a.m. Hill
said that while Pitt police were
processing the threat, another one
came through an hour after the
ﬁrst. Pitt then evacuated Towers.
An Emergency Notiﬁcation System
alert was not sent out concerning
the evacuation.

On April 7, Hill said that anoth-
er bomb threat was sent to one of
his “devices” at 10 p.m. Because he
was traveling, he did not see it until
24 hours later on April -8.

“There was no evacuation then,
but there was also no device that ex-
ploded,” Hill said in the interview.
“So basically that was another hoax
but somethingwe didn’t know about
until basically after the fact.” I

  Two campus buildings, one other  
receive threats Monday

By The Pitt News Staff

Tess Kolarik had just returned

‘from her morning run on Mon-

day when she found out that she
couldn’t get back into her dorm
room in Lothrop Hall. V J
So instead of waiting outside
the evacuated building, she took
refuge in Hillman Library. '
. “A couple friends and I_ got a
room in Hillman last night,” Ko-

larik said. “I didn’t have my phone, .

so I was hoping they would still be
there. Luckily, they were.”

At 9:20 a.m. on Monday, Pitt
sent out an Emergency Notiﬁcation
System alert to notify the campus
that Barco Law School Building,
Lothrop Hall and Holland Hall had
received bomb threats.

These threats bring the semes-

'ter’s total count to 97.

Kolarik noted that the threats
were getting in the way of her
schedule, even though she hadn’t
been in Lothrop for the evacua-
tion. _

“It wasn’t the worst-case sce-
nario, but it was still inconvenien ,”
she said. “I’ll probably have to skip

Johnston is a transgender in-
dividual, with both his driver’s
license and passport listing him
as a male.’

Jerome Cochran, executive vice
chancellor andla member of the
General Counsel of the University,
said Seamus Johnston was charged
in November with indecent expo-
sure, deﬁant trespass and disor-
derly conduct after he showered
and changed in a men’s locker
room on campus. . '

According a press release from
Johnston, the couple is considered
“persons of interest” in the bomb

threatcase, and the couple accused
Cochran of unfairly singling them

‘ ' out. A
A Cochran said that the investi— “
gation is being conducted by FBI ‘

standards and is not an attempt

by the University to intimidate the I

couple.

“It is not uncommon for indi-
viduals who become the subject of
a criminal investigation to attempt
to shift responsibility to others.
Apparently, that is happening in
this case. However, the University
has engaged in no retaliatory be-
havior. Instead, the investigation
in question is, being conducted
by the FBI in accordance with its
own standards,,”iC,ochran said in

Special agent William Crowley,

on this story. -

nervous, he is conﬁdent he will be
cleared of any wrongdoing.

“They don’t have any evidence
against us, so I hope it’s the end of
it. I really, really hope that. I’ have

to be realistic and realize if it’s to ‘

New research study brings 

light to ﬁnancial, risk issues

It turns out that the process of
ﬁnancing your education might
correlate to your risk—taking

behaviors, such "as binge drink- .

ing and smoking marijuana.
Researchers from the School
-of Family Life at Brigham Young
University lumped college stu-
dents into three categories:
those who received minimal
ﬁnancial support from their
parents, those who received
almost full support, and those
who worked together with
their parents to split costs in
some way.

Unsurprisingly, they found
that the college students who

were least likely to engage in

risky behavior were those who
primarily ﬁnanced their educa-
tion. These students were also
more likely to identify with the
' ultimate goal of their degrees:

their future, employed selves. '

The study involved 402 under-
graduate students,‘ recruited
from four universities across
the United States, along with
one of their parents.

This study brings to light
evidence of what we think is an
intuitive’ phenomenon. After
all, students ﬁnancially sup-
porting their educations could
have less time to engage in risky
behavior. Although correlation
is not causation -— and these
students are not acting in a vac-
uum, but rather dealing with
different upbringings, values

' and mind-sets —— we think it’s ‘

' worth while’ to examine ‘these
ﬁndings.
First of all, why is this the
case? ~ . -’ - ' ‘
We can use the ﬁnancial
crisis as a sort of metaphor
for how students behave ‘with
money. For instance, moral
hazard is in play when someone
uses another person’s money.
New York Times economy col-
umnist Paul Krugman deﬁnes
it as, “any situation in which

one person makes the decision’

about how much risk to take,
while someone else bears the
cost if things go badly.” These
risks, including drinking, binge

drinking, marijuana use and A

‘ works. V
Secondly, some might ask, _

smoking, all have the chance to

, effect negative consequences.

_ And then you have the bail-
out. If gooﬁng off during col-

. lege goes awry and leads to an '

extra year or two of tuition, for
example, parents can provide
a sort of security net for their
children. This can get slippery
'— it couldeven be considered

risky lending -—. and the stu- A

dents whose parents bear the

A brunt of their behavior might
not feel the true effects of their

actions.

In effect, this study fur-
ther demonstrates the way
the realm of risk and money

should parents alter the way
they ﬁnance their children’s
education? . ‘
We think there are far too
many factors at play to alter
one variable and expect a re-
sult. There is -no guarantee
that, if you take away ﬁnancial
§upport, risky behavior will

- stop. Perhaps giving students _
a bit of responsibility will help ;
. them make healthier decisions;

perhaps it won’t. »
Alternatively, we think tha

‘the way students behave on

their own in college is highly

reflective ‘of what they’ve'

learned before college. Instead
of slashing ﬁnancial support,
parents should work to imbue
the kind of work ethic in their

children they want to see long _

before college is even an is-
sue.

Finally, what does this mean ,
‘ for us students? ~
Just because you’re in one

camp or the ofher does_n’t

mean you have to subscribe to '

statistics. Of course, we allhave
friends who support and ne-
gate these research ﬁndings.

The important thing to take '
from this is that the value of an i

education can be hindered by
irresponsibility. And whether
your parents, yourself of a joint
effort is paying for your time
at'Pitt, there is a price tag for
your time here.
Make it worth it. I

THE SCHAFFADAVIT

Threat response iaasedi 

.
‘ 3

on beliefs, not science  

 

By Matt Schaff
Columnist

A If Pitt’s objective to hold safety

as its “primary concern” actually
meant ensuring safety before ad-
dressing other priorities, the Uni-
versity would close tomorrow. So

would any other institution that .'

applied the same prerequisite.
That’s because no “commitment
to safety” exercised by human be-
ings with ﬁnite resources can ac-

tually produce “safety” in its pur-

est sense. We live in" an uncertain

world characterized by constantly V

shifting, often unknown variables
that all affect the probability of
disaster; the only real escape from
threats to life — and all of its won-
ders — is not to have it.

Given how uncertainty exerts
particular’ inﬂuence on the cur-
rent bomb threat saga, the many
members of our community who
describe the University’s response
policies as interventions that
“make us safer” must think again.
Screening, notifying and evacuat-
ing might calmparents’ nerves and
reﬂect courageously on our admin-
istrators, but the/idea that anyone‘
addressing this ’tuation can wield
an adequate ‘grasp on the risk of a
violent event, let ‘alone the effects.

‘of policy on that risk, should be

thrown out. And if we can com-

, from other things we value — we

might be able to restore our Uni-
versity and aid in society’s broader
struggle to meet the challenges of
the internet age.

The ability to determine wheth-
er an event will‘ occur is indistin-
guishable from the ability to under-

stand its workings. Across many

disciplines, from psychology to_
stock market speculation, people
attempt to understand the world
by guessing at the factors they
think underlie events, assigning
weights (or probabilities) to each
factor and seeing how well_their
“models” seem to explain real-life
phenomena. Armed with models,
we try to predict the future.

Such model-based prophesying
works well when the objective is
to learn broad characteristics of

a system and when the factors are .

few and clearlyvobservable. An ex-
ample of “easy” prediction is your

a typical coin—toss scenario: “Heads

you get a dollar, tails you" lose a dol-
lar; calculate your expected value
after one day of ﬂipping.” With
the two factors and their weights

, self—evident (heads and tails, each
with equal weights and opposite .

results), the answer is unequivo-
cally zero dollars.

Once you start predicting nar-
row events that involve the behav-

     

ior of free people, such as violent
events on campus, the “expected
values” take on a new, sobering
level _of uncertainty. Take the au-
tomotive violence that, unfortu-
nately, every so often affects Fifth
Avenue. Although we might be able
to understand the general prob-
abilities of getting hit by a car on
Fifth _Avenue, we cannot possibly
produce a sure—to-be-accurate
prediction for the number of col-
lisions to occur in the next month.
To ﬁnd that, we need to intimately
understand every last contributing
factor, which could range from the
clarity of road signs, to whether
school’s in session to even the suc-
cess of the Pittsburgh Pirates years
before (some theorists would argue
that every particle in the universe
would actually have some say). To
eliminate all uncertainty from your
model, you’d have to possess.inﬁ-

- nite information about the nature

of Fifth Avenue car-pedestrian col-
lisions; that is, you’d have to be a
sort of traffic god. ,

Uncertainty might plague all
attempts at predicting events that
involve human interaction, but it
can be chillingly more virulent

, for certain attempts than others.

The Fifth Avenue collision exercise
might indeed be subject to uncer-
tainty, but it’s a pretty mild case.
Why? Because car-pedestrian col-
lisions happen often enough for us

I’m sick of it. Politicians talk-
ing this, politicians talking that,
and all the while the issues that
matter get thrown under the rug.
Taxes, blah; Iranian relations, blah;
health care, double blah! They tell

me to look at Europe, or unemploy— I
_ ment or a graph showing me how‘

happy I am under their rule, but
they never talk about what I want
them to discuss: ice cream.

Have you tried to_ get a scoop
of ice cream lately? It’s ridiculous.
‘Unfortunately, those who are sup-

posedly serving us in Washington _
just‘ don’t seem to care about the i'’;.
A plightof th_e average American.‘

Do you think that they miss out on
scoops of ice creamor go home to

__their childrenwith sorbet? .

-It started with the cost. How can

i the President and" Congress expect

me to continue voting when they
refuse to do anything about the
inﬂated cost of ice cream? From $2
a scoop to $3 a scoop to almost $4

a scoop, how do they expect me to
get to work in the morning? I wish
that it ended there, but sometimes
I need a milkshake. Every now and

‘ then, I want to have the chocolate-
. dipped waffle. cone. But with costs

increasing, there is no more room

for luxury in America.

Q It’s not that I want a free hand-
out of ice cream. I want to work

, for my ice.cream just like I always

have, when I at least,used to be
able to'satis_fy myself on a reason-
able salary. We are becoming a
nation of ice cream haves and ice
cream have nots. It’s the American
dream: study hard, work hard.and

 getfsome ice ‘cream. Unfortunately,
that dream is becoming a reality"

for fewer and fewer Americans. '
Then there is the entire issue of

ice cream freedoms. Do youknow

there used to be just two -kinds of

ice cream? There was chocolate,»
and there was vanilla. If you liked .

chocolate, you were a normal per-
son, and all the kids who ordered
vanilla were mocked. ‘Then, the

politically correct police decided’

that the vanilla kids needed to
be respected, so they introduced

- strawberry. Three ﬂavors seemed

a little excessive but were gener-
ally OK’. i t

Now when I walk into an ice
cream parlor, there are dozens
of ﬂavors. I can only pronounce

‘ about half of the vocabulary in the

place, and they even have to give
out free samples because so few
people can actually understand

V what ﬂavor they are about to taste.

Think about how the costs are be-
ing driven up!

But here come the old gelato
partiers to say that if one ﬂavor is
taken off the board, then freedoms
are under attack! And instead of
ﬁnding a way to compromise or
work toward an acceptable solu-
tion, everyone just blames each
other. ‘

There are two sides of the‘ aisle

I inside the beltway. There is one

problem plaguing this nation, one
issue that just needs a consensus

amlthe American Dream: Give me a scoop of freedom

to decide, yes, we can. Because
if there is one thing I like about
change, it is when it jingles in my
pocket on the way to the ice cream
parlor. But the two sides don’t want
to ﬁgure it, out, they just want to
put the fault on each other.

With all of the ﬁnger pointing
and blame games, there are inno-
cent victims included in this: me,
you and everyone who just wants
a good scoop of ice cream after a
long day. Because isn’t that what
being American is all about — life,
liberty and the pursuit of happi-
ness in a cone? '

So listen here President Barack
Obama and Speakei-‘john Boehner,
if you reallypwant to show people

' that you care about your constitu-
ents, then you will do something
' about ice cream in America. I don’t
care if you’re rallying cry is “Milk,

pings” strategy; I just want prices

to construct reasonably accurate
models, thereby getting a “pretty
good sense” (within an inevitable
error margin) of the identity and
weight of the contributing fac-
tors. To reduce road violence on
Fifth Avenue, we can then target
the “major factors” with policy, at
least in theory. '
But devising similarly -educated
policies to protect against a pos-
sible, devastatingly violent event at
Pitt (like a bomb threat coming to
fruition) is farmore difficult .—— the
current situation does'not afford us
an equivalent f‘pretty good sense.”

And the last 50 years provided only
two U.S. university bombings,
neither of which was preceded by
ﬂoods of emailed threats, for us
to learn from. Without any higher
education institution having ever
experienced Pitt’s unique set of
‘conditions, uncertainty is king.
At this moment, we cannot
expect anyone —— "investigator,
dean or chancellor — to identify
the relevant factors or respective
weights. With so little information
regarding the factors underlying
sensational campus violence, we
also cannot conﬁdently pinpoint
the direction that the bomb threats
or the University’s responses might
have moved Pitt’s “safety level.” Ac-
cordingly, no Pitt response policy
can be based on acceptably sci-

entiﬁc analyses. Instead, all our '

leaders have to work with are

‘under-educated guesses, in other

words, beliefs. .

There’s an unfortunate thing
about ﬁghting uncertainty with
belief—based policies: For every be-
lief there’s a counter-belief, often
of equal reasonability. Some say
the bomb threats indicate a will to-
do physical harm; others say the
threats’ so -far—empty- nature reveal
perpetrators who merely seek to
disrupt. Some say screening,‘ noti-
fying and evacuating has protected
students; others say the structural
and emotional disruptions ensuant
from the policies encourage more
threatening, potentially violent be-
havior. Essentially, whether we’re
less safe now or whether Pitt’s

policies “make us safer” depends
» on what you believe, not what you
- can prove.

The business of providing
saf_ety_from devastating outlier
events such as campus bombings

. is like playing chess blindfolded:_

To exist is to move pieces, and any
attempt to gain real understanding
of the happenings of the game or
the impact of your moves comes
at huge costs with only dubious
beneﬁts (which arrive asbeliefs,
not predictive models). If we try
to control the game, we end up not
making any moves at all.

Helen Keller, whose blindness
and deafness might have right-
fully prevented her from taking
on an uncertain world, intrepidly
discarded such fear—wallowing,

writing, “Security is mostly a su-

perstition  Life is either a dar- ‘

ing adventure, or nothing.” As Pitt
has demonstrated a willingness to
jeopardize its educational values
for the sake of an unconﬁrmable
sense of safety whenever some-
. one hits the send button on an
anonymous threat, we can only
hope Keller’s attitude will ﬁnd fu-
ture reception. Otherwise, we have
enslaved our hopes and fears to the
ever-present uncertain. I

Your average bottle of whiskey will
have .a label that’s some variation
of dark beige or dark brown, cov-
ered in block text that includes
pictures of waterfowl or old men
with moustaches. If you pick up
a bottle of Wigle Whiskey on the
other hand, you’ll see pastel col-
ors, Philip Wig1e’s playful, broken
noose and a few white letters that
proclaim its hometown of Pitts-
burgh, Pa.

Wigle Whiskey and its home at

the Pittsburgh Distilling Company
on Smallman Street in the Strip
District are making a splash as the
city’s ﬁrst and only craft distillery.
This new business is not the work
of a transplant from the better-
known whiskey countries to the
north or south but the work of a
Pittsburgh native who wanted to
do something different after he
left the legal profession.

“I had to learn a new craft,”
said Mark Meyer, who is the own-
er of the company alongside his

family: wife, Mary Ellen Meyer;
son," Eric Meyer; daughter, Mer-
edith Grelli; and son—in-law, Alex
Grelli. A family vacation through
the wine country of NewYork in

-~ 2010 sparked an interest not just
for Mark Meyer, but for the rest of A

his family as well. V
“We were visiting these vine-
yards thinking ‘What is an urban
counterpart to a vineyard?’ be-
cause you can’t grow grapes in
Pittsburgh very well,” Meredith
Grelli said. “So we started doing
some research while we were on
vacation and found this rich whis-

key history back home.”

The family went into hyper-
drive, planning and working to-
gether to make these ideas into a
sober reality.

“I really loved the idea of a fam-
ily business,” said Mary Ellen Mey-
er. “Our children went far away for
college and jobs, so we’re delighted
that they chose to return to Pitts-
burgh for this. We all have quite
different interests and skill sets,
and who would have thought that
whiskey-making would have pulled
those together? But it has.”

Each of those skills came in
handy. Mark’s experience as a law-
yer helped the company navigate
the extensive paperwork involved
in opening a distillery, including a
change to Pennsylvania state law
thatallows Wigle to, sell its prod-

ucts on-site. Eric used a passion

gained during-his timein Kyrgyz-
stan with the Peace Corps.
“He worked in a micro—distill-

ery there,” said Mary Ellen, “and,

gainedan interest in doing that
kind of work someday.” Almost

from the beginning there has been

another silent partner that gives

the whiskey its peculiar name.
“We found Wigle and just fell

in love with him,” said Grelli. The

l history of the region as an early '

epicenter for Americanwhiskey
production and the famous Whis-
key Rebellion led.the family to
a man named Phillip Wigle who
became a folk hero for punching
a tax collector. In the 1790s Alex-

ander Hamilton was trying to pay

the huge debts America had rung
up during the Revolutionary War,
and he decided the best way to do
that was to put an excise tax on

whiskey.‘

“You can imagine how well that
went over,” said Grelli. “One day
Wigle decided to go to the house
of the local tax collector and ask
for his whiskey taxes back.” While
some of the history is hazy, it’s
known that at some point Wigle
fought with the man.

The protests in this part of the
country escalated for years until
protesters opened ﬁre on tax col-
lectorjohn Neville. This prompted
a federal response, and President
George Washington led a force of
13,000 troops against Pittsburgh’s
roughly 400 residents.

“The reason it’s so prominent
in sixth grade history books is
because i_t’s the one time a sitting
president has led troops against
his own people,” said Grelli. Wigle
was eventually pardoned, the_un-
raveling noose on Wigle Whiskey’s
wheat and rye bottles alluding to
his fate.

Behind that noose,-the bottle’s
clear liquid hints to something
unique about this product that’s
more often thought of as having
an aged, amber hue provided by

years of careful storage in hard-
wood barrels.

“These are not moonshine,”
Grelli said. “What’s different-is the
essence of the grain is still in this.
In aged whiskey most of the ﬂavor
is comingfrom the barrels. It’s sort
of like light versus dark tequila or
rum, but it hasn’t really been done
with whiskey until recently. There
hasnit been a lot of experimenta-
tion, but now there’s a craft com-
munity that has sprung up and
willing to try these things.”

_ Along with small casks for
enthusiasts to age it themselves,
the Wigle is aging a great deal too.
“We’re aging half of the whiskey
we produce, so besides the wheat
and rye whiskey, we’ll have aged
versions in a couple of years,” said
Grelli. Whatever ﬁnal form the
whiskey might take, every batch
is made in smaller parts with or-
ganic grain that’s milled on-site
and distilled using a copper kettle
custom—made in Germany. Tall and
somewhat imposing with its‘ own

brassy orange sheen, the still was '

created by a ﬁrm that doesn’t just

Improv group it Steps
    acts spontaneous

Written by Larissa Gula
Photos by Huailei Wang

When a group of comedians spon-
taneously decided to “transform”
into zombies before a Monday
night show and chase their fearful
teammates around the Steel City
Improv theater, intern Connor Mc-
Canlus could only shake his head
and say, “You never know what to
expect during improv.”

These are words that improv
performers live by, especially in
Pittsburgh where the improv com-
edy scen,e;fonce tiny and disjoint-
ed, has transformed and surprised
lo_cals with the ways it’s changed in
the last few years.

_ Improv, short for improvisa-
tion, is the performed action of
creating something on the spot,
usually in response to another
person or to how the performer
feels. p ’ 4

A, In recent years, the number of

local improv performers has in-

creased in the area. While the city

once hosted the same handﬁil of, ‘

people jumping between troupes,
. several new improv show stages,

including Steel City, have now pro- -

vided regular performances and a
gathering space for more than 10
improv troupes.

Some troupes have two people,
such as Tragic Bliss, which features
Beth Meenan and Steel City Improv
house manager Donald Kingsbury.
Other troupes feature as many as
seven members, like the Hush
Hush Consensus.

Despite the number of troupes,
the overlap between groups is still

there. For example, Meenan also
performs in the Hush Hush Con-
sensus. ’ . -
“There are a number of people
associated with Steel City Improv
who do the Thursday night Im-
prov Jam downtown,” McCanlus
said. “There’s a lot of overlap with
Irony City. And a lot of people on
the college scenes ﬁnd their way
to those shows.” S '
Pittsburgh’s improv scene has
developed from the college set-
ting. The comedy show Friday Nite
lmprovs, or FN I, has been running
for 22 years on Pitt’s campus and is

2 "the?-longest—runningiéomedy show ‘

in the country, according to the

» show’s hosts. C

Originally, ‘FNIC was nothing
more than a small group of bored
graduate students who wanted to
learn improv, explained co—host
John Feightner. They would gath-
er on Friday nights, make up silly
games on the spot and test each
other’s performing abilities, try-
ing to make their buddies laugh
as they played for several hours
at a time. - '

Students began to bring friends
and classmates, and the small
group eventually grew too big to ﬁt
into the normal-sized classrooms
and dorm rooms. Participants be-
gan paying an entrance fee, saving
up so they could rent some space
on campus. '

“They then slowly built a show
where anyone could show up and
try out improv in a low-stake per-
formance space,” Feightner said.

Politics threaten Planned Parenthood, funding uncertain

Written by Kirstin Kennedy

If the Republican primaries have

said anything about Americans,
it’s how particular we are about
contraception and even fussier
about how we obtain it. With de-

V bates about the importance of

accessible birth control and the
threats to cut federal funding to
Planned Parenthood, women and
men alike have to wonder how pri-
vate their bedrooms really are. The
social issue is getting more and
more heated, and the average Joe
the Plumber andjane the, uh, Con-
traceptive Consumer are ﬁnding
their voices.

Republican candidate Mitt

the birth control debate

Nearly two-thirds of Americans support the new
federal mandate that private health insurance plans,
even those offered by religiously affiliated

Romney has stated in his official
values that he believes “through
the good heart of America” his
presidency would overturn Roe
v. Wade. If elected into office, he
plans to cut federal fundingto
Planned Parenthood. In February,
Rick Santorum conﬁrmed to CBS

‘reporter Charlie Rose that “[Con—

traceptives] are not okay because
it’s a license to do things in the
sexual realm that is counter to how
things are suppose[d] to be.”
Why does accessible birth con-
trol, family planning and preven-
tative health care seem to be such
a forefront of the Republican pri-
maries? After the 2008 election,
which focused almost exclusively
on the l issue of the ‘economy, it

According to political science
professor Susan B. Hansen, the
focus on the social issue of contra-
ception is a reaction to President
Obama’s attempt to require preven-
tive care in all private health care
plans. ‘She says that all of the Re-
publican candidates have pledged
to repeal “Qbamacare” and that,
if cut, such preventative services
will be left up to private insurance
companies. These services refer to
things like breast exams and can-
cer screenings. Even contraceptive
measures like birth control and the
Nuva Ring medically fall under the
umbrella of preventative care.

That means that a sizable
number of low—income
women are receiving
their birth control from
the federally funded or-
ganization. , .
Three percent of the
services that Planned
Parenthood provides are
abortions. The rest of
the organization’s time
is spent dealingwith pre-
ventative issues, such as

Pap tests, breast exams.

and birth control options,
as well as STI testing and

Planned Parenthood with
private insurance and 12
percent self-pay and are
uninsured, according to

. Rebecca Cavanaugh, vice

president of media and
public affairs at Planned
Parenthood of Western

Pennsylvania.

“All [regular] abortions are self-
paid,” Cavanaugh said. Planned
Parenthood’s abortion services are
often jarring to many pro-life tax
payers, but the facts about what
is and is not federally funded are
clear. “Abortions because of rape,
incest or life of the mother are
federally funded, typically with
Medicare, but Planned Parenthood
only performs routine procedure,
so abortions provided because of
threat to the life of the mother are
very rare and often turned over to
Magee Womanfs Hospital.”

Family planning at Planned Par-

enthood exists through foundation A

donations as well as individual do-
‘nors. There is also state and fed-
eral funding for preventative care,
meaning Pap tests, breast exams
and birth control. Cavanaugh also
noted that internal audits are of-
ten performed throughout Planned
Parenthood of Western Pennsyl-
Vania.

Supporters of Planned Parent-
hood wonder why politicians want
to cut the program after deeming
it unﬁt for government spending.
“The Hyde Amendment says that
any family planning organization
that receives Title 10 funding,
which is the funding that Planned
Parenthood gets, cannot be used
for abortion services,” Abby Mun-
dell, president and founding mem-
ber of the on-campus Planned Par-
enthood s_upport club‘ said. “So, if
you cut the federal funding, it’s not
going to cut abortion service. What
you are cutting is preventative ser-

vices.” Voices for Planned Parent-

hood, known as VOX, is Planned
Parenthood’s outreach to college
campuses. Pitt’s chapter of VOX
is a recognized SGB club.
“College students‘ are not go-
ing to stop having sex because
birth control isn’t available,” Al-
yssa Pascarosa, vice-president of

l VOX, said. She went on to consider

the dangers of abortions and birth
control methods which aren’t reg-
ulated. As a result,‘ VOX is active
in writing letters to legislators
and participating in projects of
awareness to the importance of
maintaining government—funded
family planning.

For anti-contraceptive protest-
ers, the issue of accessible birth
control isn’t strictly driven by
religious or political affiliations,
or so says retired mother of 11,
Sally Brunn. Brunn stands outside
Planned Parenthood early on a Fri-
day morningas part of the Forty
Days for Life campaign, a pro-life

organization that protests abor-
tions by, what they call a “40—day
peaceful public witness outside
the Planned Parenthood abortion
clinic” during the Christian season
of Lent.

“It’s not religious at all,” Brunn
said in regard to her morning pro-

_test. “It’s medical, and it’s freedom...

for women to know. Women are
exploited by abortion and chemical
contraception because they both
hurt women terribly. It gives you
cancer, for instance.” '
She goes on to explain that
pregnancy causes the breast glands
to create milk ducts, claiming that
when the pregnancy is stopped,
through abortion or the use of oral
contraceptives, the ducts mutate
and potentially cause breast can-

C61‘. 4'"

“It has been proven that a first
abortion or chemical contracep-
tion for any length of time before
you have had a child will give you
breast cancer if you are exposed to
it to begin with,”'Brunn said.

That is not necessarily true. The
American Cancerlsociety reports
that a woman’s risk for breast can-
cer increases slightly while taking
an oral contraceptive and that risk
diminishes when the woman stops
taking the contraceptive. The or»...
ganization also reports that there
is no correlation between having
an abortion and developing breast
cancer.

Still, Brunn and her fellow pro-
testers have stood and will con-
tinue to stand outside Planned
Parenthood of Western Pennsyl-
vania in hopes that their message
is heard. They hold signs with pic-
tures of mothers and children and
pass out information about their ’
organization. “It’s wrong to kill a‘-
baby at any point in its life because
when an egg and a sperm join, that
is a living child right there with all
the DNA that’s necessary for it to
grow up to be a person, an adult
person,” Brunn said. Forty Days for.,,,
Life makes a mission to stop abor-
tion, to close down facilities that
provide them and to deter doctors
who perform them.

Cavanaugh doesn’t see the
attacks on Planned Parenthood
or the stream of anti-accessible ‘

4 contraceptive legislation ending

anytime soon. While Planned Par- 1
enthood of Western Pennsylvania
is committed to helping women
and men, it cannot exist on its sup-
porters alone. i x:

“If federal funding is cut, we
will have to turn patients away,”
Cavanaugh said. E

“They chose us because .we
were urban and family, and they
liked that,” said Grelli. While not
the only~craft distiller in Penn-
sylvania, the Pittsburgh Distill-
ing Company is one of only a few

Pittsburgh, a location which is
central to the distillery’s phi-
losophy and practice.

“It’s been nice because it’s
introduced me to people who I
didn’t really see in my last voca-
tion,” said Mark Meyer. Local
bartenders, kitchen managers
and devoted fans have created
a community based around this
new local product.

“People have come in here

'5 because they want to see what’s

going on,” said Grelli. “We show
them what we do, and they get
excited about it. We haven’t had
to pound a lot of pavement. We
have some seriously skilled mix-
ologists in town that tasted the —
stuff and really wanted to put
it on their menu.” Restaurants
from Union Pig and Chicken to
Oakland’s Mad Mex have placed
it alongside national brands be-
hind their bars.

Through the whole experi-

ence, the family has become
closer with each other.
“Because we’re new at it,
and there are many varying
demands, we have come to
respect that everyone is work-
ing hard to make it work,” said
Mary Ellen Meyer. “Some days
are 6 a.m. to midnight. I really
don’t know how you could do -
a business like this if it wasn’t

. family.”

During those long hours, new
products, from a variation of gin
called jenivier to a spicier and
more robust rye whiskey, have
been developed with an eye for
Wigle’s customers.

“We have a number-of tasters
who come in and help us develop
our new products,” Grelli said.
Those testers, along with ev-
eryone who tours the old ware-
house, have been trainediiri the ,
art of tasting whiskey. Whether
you’re sipping on the spicy rye,
the smooth and sweet wheat or
even the bottle of swill many
have at home, the steps for tast-
ing whiskey are the-same.

“You want to put it on your
tongue and swirl it around so it
hits every part of your tongue,”
Grelli said. “There’s a southern
version of that where you al-
most chew it, and then there’s
the Wigle way where you just
drink it.”

_ IMPROV

FROM PAGE 9

While a number of those in-
volved in the show are Pitt alumni,
FNI, which is not affiliated with Pitt
or its theater department, is now
run by people who have already

" graduated -— the result of FNI’s
rental contracts and insurance.

FNI, which ended its season this
year early because of the ongoing
bomb threats at Pitt, differs from
a number of other improv stages in

 ,. Pittsburgh. The nature of the show

allows anyone to perform during
one of six or seven improv games
that provide structure for short
bursts of on-the-spot comedy, all
based on one-word suggestions

W from the audience.
’ "Ben Mayer, a Pitt graduate who .

currently works as a lawyer, has
hosted FNI since 1998. Through-
out the years, Mayer has catego-
rized more than 40 team games,
guessing games and story-telling

 .« games — just some of the different

improv activities.
Mayer’s favorite game to watch
is called musical improv. In this

game, performers create a silly
song on the spot within the con-
text of a scene that a member of
the audience suggests.

“A lot of the games are more or
less passed along between improv
shows and groups,” Feightner said.
“A lot of improv groups do play
more or less the same game un-
der a different name with minor
changes.”

Improv shows use the game

system for short-form improv or ~

short comedy scenes. But not ev-
ery improv show uses this system.
Steel City Improv, which opened
in January 2011, allows perform-
ers to try their hand at long-form
improv.

“You still take an audience’s
suggestion, but then you spark an
entire show on the spot off of that
one word,” explained Kingsbury.
“A single scene in long-form im-
prov can last over 20 minutes.”

While short—form improv has .

been long-established in Pitts-
burgh, long-form improv has
increased in popularity recently.
The Pittsburgh Improvjam, which
opened two years ago at the Caba-
ret, also provides a stage for long-
form improv.

“What I have noticed is a‘moVe
away from short—form shows to
long-form shows,” said Cabaret
manager Randy Kirk, who wanted
to provide space for long-form im-
prov precisely for this reason. “So
there are more improvised plays

or longer scenes with commit- '

ment.”

The appeal of long-formis that
“you see people... sustain actual
scenes,” Kirk explained.

“These are performers who can.
create something complex out of
one word over 20 minutes. It’s like
watching a play being created out
of nothing,” he said. A

While a long-form scene may

chronicle two people bonding dur-

ing their attempt to escape a cave

ﬁlled with demons, short-form -

may involve just two minutes of
raunchy and silly exchanges be-
tween two rival super—villains who
bump into each other in the doc-
tor’s oﬂice.

But these differences in com-
edy are why “it’s deﬁnitely good
that there’s a’ balance of both in
the city,” McCanlus said.

“Short-form is absolutely hi-
larious,” he said. “I look at it as
getting both dinner and dessert,

and everyone has a different palate
and-different tastes.”

It’s not just the local scene that
has evolved and changed over the
years either. The improvers them-
selves have changed their perfor-
mance styles over‘time as they hav
learnedtheir craft. '

Learning the art of improvisa-
tion used to be much trickier. Orig-
inally, performers hunted down

books in librariesand practiced’

in shows to learn improv skills.

Now, interested performers are ,

told tp invest in classes with Steel
City when possible.
Liz Labacz, an improvist and

_ co—host at FNI, described a good

improv scene as a conversation
between two performers who
listen and respond to each other;
although, she couldn’t describe
exactly how that conversations
works. '

“Both performers need to take
turns shaping a scene,” she said.
“It’s all about watching for people
the same way you do in a conversa-
tion. You just know.”

And even after mastering the

conversation of good improv, a A
number of improvers need to learn V
to break the habit of ‘creating re-r

peat characters and gags to us
on stage. , '

“I_ think that while every per-
former has a trick, or a safe zone,
you can’t plan anything, and you
can’t limit yourself,” McCanlus
said. “After a certain point, things
stop being improvised, and they
become planned, or they become
gags.” _

There are exceptions to every
rule though. Feightner uses sev-
eral ﬂexible stock characters when
performing.

“I play clueless, angry dad a
lot,’’ he said. “I play a lot of dumb
guy characters. I also love play-
ing little kids because I love the
crazy imaginations they have. I
love boastful or dumb characters
or kids.”

But whatever a performer’s style
and level of experience, the best
thing about Pittsburgh’s improv
scene is how it welcomes everyone
on stage, Kingsbury said.

“[In my opinion,] this is the best
place to be for improv,” Kingsbury
said on the communal feeling that
a smaller city like Pittsburgh of-
fers. “Improv is only going to grow
here, and I think we’ll surpass the

_scenes in Chicago or New Yor ”

Being a Newjersey Devils fan froni Philadelphia

who lives in Pittsburgh and havingto choose who
to hate more — the Penguins or the Flyers —? is
one of the harder decisions I’ve had to make in
my life. V

But as the Pittsburgh Penguins came undone
on Sunday afternoon, the world got to watch
Sidney Crosby turn into afull—ﬂedged punk, and
my decision got awhole lot easier. ‘ *

an enormous hockey crowd watching, Crosby
showed everyone outside of the Keystonestate
why heis either adored or despised between Ohio
and Newjersey. ‘

It started in the ﬁrst period when, with eight

minutes left and the Penguins down 3-1, Crosby ’

took afew cheap shots on Flyers’ goalie Ilya Bryz-
galov’s glove. Crosby, whose shotfrom behind the
net got stuck, wound up and smacked Bryzgalov’s

’ glove — hard — three times in a rowbefore Fly-

ers forward Claude Giroux wrapped him up and
pulledhimaway. ,

Then, moments later; Crosby pushed away
Jakub Voracek’s glove as theFlyers player bent
down to pick it up. His instigaﬁon wasn’t over

there, Crosby turned and grabbed an unsus-

pecting Kimmo Timonen —— a Flyer who is well
respected for not starting ﬁghts —- and began
throwing punches. . - -

' After the linesmen broke it up, Crosbfs cow-

walking away, Crosby exchanged words with

As the game progressed and the Flyers’
domination continued, the Penguins—speciﬁ-

‘ cally Crosby — played some of the most classless

hockeyl have ever seen. A
When the third period rolled around, emo-
tions erupted again, and the two teams left all in-
hibition at home in a series of scraps that showed
the true hatred betweenthem. Of course, Crosby

this series—was behind it again. .

On the Friday’ of the Sea Ray Relays,

‘* Spratling ﬁnished third in the 200-meter

dash with a time of 21.21 seconds. Murray

and freshmanjosh Mindlin turned in top-15

ﬁnishes as well with times of 21.59 and 21.83
seconds, respectively.

The Panthers also received continued

. ,production from their youth.

Freshman Joshua Thompson ﬁnished
sixth in the 11o—meter hurdles with a per-
sonal best time of 14.18 seconds. He also
ﬁnished in the top-10 of the 100-meter dash
with a time of 10.78 seconds. In addition,
sophomore Reginald Steele IV ﬁnished right
behind Thompson with a time of 10.85 sec-
onds. Steele also ﬁnished ﬁfth in the long
jump competition with a distance of 7.28
meters,

Seniors Dan Kwiatkowski and Kurt Barn-
hart ﬁnished fourth and seventh, respec-

xtively, in the open discus competition and
the invitational discus throw with distances
of 42.39 meters and 47.26 meters. Kwiat-
kowski hit the Big East qualifying mark of
15.98 meters in the shot put as well.

“I deﬁnitely think everyone went out
there and gave their all in the showcase of
the meet,” Spratling said. “I deﬁnitely think
everyone showed up and did what they had.
to do to be successful.”

On Saturday, the Sea Ray Relays featured
the meet’s showcase event, which included

 

April 17, 2012 I The Pitt News l vvvvvx/.pittnevvs.com

only the top heats in nine varying events.
Pitt had two relay teams and seven athletes
competing as individuals in the showcase.
Several of the Panthers’ times met Big East

~« qualiﬁcations.

Spratling and Murray were two of seven
Panthers competing as individuals on Sat-

urday. In addition, seniorjermaine Lowery -

placed ﬁrst in the 400-meter hurdleswith
a time of 50.86 seconds. _

Pitt’s 1,600—meter and 4oo—meter relay
team ﬁnished ﬁrst and third, respectively,
in the showcase.

Panthers Dontave Cowsette and Sam Neg-

— ley were Big East qualiﬁers in the 800-meter

event with times of 1:50:96 and 1:53:10,
respectively. I

A Pitt senior Cambryajones led the way for
the women’s team as she swept her 200-me-
ter dash competition with a mark of 23'.31
seconds at the showcase. Junior jonnique
Lawrence ﬁnished second in the 4oo—meter
showcase.

Jones and Lawrence were also ,a part of
the women’s 400-meter relay team that ﬁn-
ished second with a time of 45.07 seconds
and included teammates Jordan Hoyt and
Ashley Woodford.

“This year we’ve been trusting Coach
[Webb] more and knowing we’re going to get
the best outcome following what he says and
not asking questions,” Lawrence said.

The women had a productive day qualify-
ing for Big East top marks. Freshmen Brooke
Shasteen and Casey Meier’s respective javelin
distances of 38.21 and 40.52 meters earned

them eighth and ﬁfth place ﬁnishes.

Capitalizing on the team’s youth, fresh-
man Brittany Lightfoot threw shot put 13.76
meters and also qualiﬁed for the Big East
competition. V

Next up for the Panthers -this weekend
will be the Legacy Track Meet in Baltimore,
Md. Penn Relays, Big East Championships
and NCAA Regionals will follow.

“We expect to get a little bit better in
every meet we go to, and that’s been the
theme all year,” said Coach Webb. “The goal
is to have somewhere between 12 and 15 kids
qualify for the national championship.”

Lawrence said she is looking forward to
the meet this weekend.

“We want to win this meet like we did
last year,” she said. “We have more athletes
this year. We want to go out there and have
fun, and the performances will ‘take care of
themselves.” .

Spratling has several goals for the re-
mainder of theseason.

“I would like to win the Big East,” he
said. “It’s a good way to send out our seniors
that have been holding the team together.
After that I hope to have a good showing at
regionals and nationals.” _

However, the_season does not end at na-
tionals for Spratling.

“After nationals I’m hoping to qualify for
Olympic trials and see where that takes me,”

A Spratling said.

one in the stadium how the Flyers had been dis-
mantling the Penguins on the ice.

This game, to me, was proof of a few things:

1) - The Penguins simply don’t know howto
lose (orwin). After droppingtwo on their home ice
and then losing again Philadelphia, theyfve shown
that once they_’re down, thefll stoop to new lows
in order to upset people or cause injuries.

2) . Sidney Crosby is a joke. After renum-
ing ﬁom  concussion, the mega-star has been
nothing more than one of those little rodents in
a Whack-A-Mole arcade game. He pops up and
starts trouble, then retreats to hide behind his
friends when confronted. He either knows he
has a glass chin and can’t take a punch from one
of the Flyers’ tough guys, or this is just the way he
acts when he can’t get it done on the ice.

3) This season, the Flyers arebetterthan

the Penguins inalmost every way. I’ve heard peo-
ple talk in" Pittsburgh about how Bryzgalov is a

O bo1Iom—15 goalie inthe league. Well, Marc Andre

Fleuiy has let up 18 goals in three games. Giroux
has outplayed Crosby, and Hartnell has performed
betterthan Malkin. Iwouldn’t be surprised if the
Flyers swept the series on Thursday night.

Inthe meantime, Penguin fans will have towait
anxiously for disciplinary hearings today before
the two teams face off again Wednesday night. You
can ‘expect the Penguins tobeshort-handed and
the Flyers faithful to be inﬁill force on Wednesday.
I’ll be rocking my orange and black. 3‘ *

all year, I knew I was going to have to keep them
to a pretty low score today,” Wothersp oon said.
“Thankfully, we got a couple off him, and Iwas

_ able to keep them to one.”

Still pitching in the ninth inning, Wother—
spoon allowed a lead—off single, and the runner
was sacriﬁced over with a bunt.]ordano made
the decision with two outs remaining to put in
his usual ﬁrst-game starter, Matt Iannazzo.

’ The senior struck out the ﬁnal twobatters
and secured a big conferencewin for the Pan-
thers despite his unusual position.

“You come out throwing ﬁill throttle and
give everything you have,” Iannazzo said about
the different approach in a relief appearance.
“My team needed me in that role today, and it
worked out well. We got a big W.”

USF 6 Pitt 5

The Pitt offense got on the board ﬁrst with
three runs in the ﬁrst inning. DeFabio walked
to start the game, advanced around the paths
on an error and a wild pitch, then scored on a
passed ball.

Then, doubles by Parente and Casey Roche
scored Rick Devereaux and Parente, respec-
tively. '

South Florida earned a run back in the top
of the second on a passed. ball, but the fourth
irmingwas the biggest of the day for both teams

when the Bulls came through with four runs ' ‘

on three hits‘. »
Starting pitcher Ethan Mildren was pulled

by _]ordano_ in the ﬁﬁzh inning after allowing '

ﬁve runs on 10 hits.

“I was missing a lot of locations with my
pitches,” Mildren said. “I was struggling to
throw my off—speed stuff for strike one and
found myself falling behind in the count a
lot.”

Roche doubled again in the bottom of the
fourth and came around to score when Evan
Oswald grounded out to the shortstop nar-
rowing the gap to one run.

_].R. Leonardi, who earned the win earlier in
the week at Akron, came in for 2.2 innings of
work, allowing zero runs and no hits.

After the teams tradedruns inthe eighth in-
ning, South Florida held on in the ninth to pick
up the win in the second game of the series.

For the third—straight game against the
Bulls, Pitt jumped out to an early lead with
two runs on three hits, including a lead—off
home run by DeFabio.

The bats came through with another run in
the second inning when Mike Douglas scored
on an Oswald-sacriﬁce ﬂy.

The Bulls plated their ﬁrst run in the fourth
on a solo home run, but the Panthers coun-
tered with two more in the bottom of the inning
thanks to solo homers from Derik Wilson an
DeFabio. ‘

But then South Florida put together its best

Iannazzo was pulled following the rough inning
after surrendering six runs, ﬁve earned, walk-

Luke Novosel then pitched two scoreless
innings for the Panthers, and the Pitt offense
came through with two runs in the bottom of

in DeFabio and eventually scored on a single

Panthers with a double and was driven home by
the next batter, Soto, on a single. With a run-
ner on second and down a run, the Pitt offense
failed to extend the game and fell by a run to the
Bulls for the second time in two days.

“That was a very difficult game today. Our‘ "

team played hard, but we did not ﬁnish the
game,” Jordano said. “Give credit to South

- Florida for getting the big hits in critical situ—

ations, and they have proved why they are the
ﬁrst—p1ace team in the conference.”

The Panthers visit‘Kent State and host Akron,‘

this week before facing rival West Virginia in

“We are very frustrated as a team right now,”
Jordano said. “We must learn how to win. Every
