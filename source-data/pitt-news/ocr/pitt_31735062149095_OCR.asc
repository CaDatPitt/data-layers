Cathedral Houses
1 Downtown School

Move Of Night Classes Enlarges
Campus Population By 2,317

 

In order to present a more com-

plete educational program and to cen-
tralize all University schools and de-
partments, all. night classes in the
Downtown Division will be ‘moved to
the Cathedral, Monday. '
This decision by the University to"
eliminate the classes held in the
Chamber of Commerce building will
move 2,317 students out to the Oak-
land campus.

The primary reason, according to
John Weber, business manager of the
University, is that adequate facilities
w;ll be available on the campus that
will aid the students in their work.
Science laborator'es and the new li-
brary facilities will be opened -to the
,,evening classes. The facilities for
social activities’, ‘extracurricular’ activ-
ities, and athletics will also add to
the evening educational program.

New classroom assignments will be
given Monday with the evening stu-
dents’ using the same rooms as the
day students... The Law school ,will
hold classes ‘on the 14th and 15th
floors of the Cathedral. '

Until the Commons Room is com-
pleted, offices for the_Downtown' Di-
vision will be available, on the ﬁrst
floor, A temporary social room will
also be offered to the students on the
first ﬂoor.
The moving of the division’down-
town to the Cathedral will complete
the centralization of the University,
conﬁning _it to the Oakland district.
The immediate reason for the change
is one of economy. ' ,-

“There is no doubt that the next

The primary obstacles“ to a peace
program, Mr. Raushenbush maintain-
ed, are economic. As long as we think

of America as a “poor nation” which

must of necessity go_ gallivanting
through the world markets for foreign
trade, there will not be peace. Neither
will there be peace unless thereis a
profound economic reorganization at
home. Economic groups blocked the
maintenance of strict neutrality dur-
ing" the period from 1914 to 1917, just
as they blocked the enactment of
stringent. neutrality legislation this

among which were _'the phosphor-

the songs in a lighter vein insisting-
on-being bummed on the way home.
The onlycriticism‘ on this score was
that at times the orchestra did not
seem to play loud enough to support
someof the weaker voices; while on
one or two occasions, perhaps through
bribery on the part of singers, the
orchestra drowned out the last few
bars of other singers.
While the action seemed to drag
lightly toward the middle of the first
act, after the wheel-beds had made
several trips through the swinging
doors, the movement of the comedy
was far from lagging as the cast
swung into the mob scene of the sec-
ond act and before the effective back-
drop of the ﬁnal scene. -

Theodore Viehman, Gene Kelly, the
lyricists and composers, costumers,
and stage crews all seemed to have
connived (that’s' the" word!) with
Spanos and Saﬁron to make this

and Gown history. In short, the mass
of material, the large cast, and the
music and dialog and scenes com-
positely made your reviewer think of
the old stage gag where the Italian-
rope-twirler, a forerunner of the late
Will Rogers, used to say:
' “I shall now skip-a-da rope ten thou-
sand consekative times.” '
The Italian ‘then skipped the rope
eight or ten times, stopped, grinned,
and said, “Well, that gives a.-general
idea.”. '

April Issue Of Alumni Magazine
Discusses Earle Controversy

Information on the latest develop-
ments in the controversy between
the University and Governor Earle
again occupies a prominent position
in the April number of _the Alumni
Review, now being mailed to alumni
subscribers. _ -
An editorial in the magazine de-
fends the University and its Board of
Trustees and warns the Governor of
theconsequences which would result
from his cutting the school's appro-
priation. It points_ out that were the
Governor's threat carried out, it would
probably deprive more than 2 000 stu-
dents of scholarship aid, and force
the University to discontinue extend-
ing the privilege of deferred payment
to more than 3,000 others.
““We"hope,” the editorial says, “that
Governor Earle is sincerely interested
in the future of the University so that
he will cooperate with the Board ‘of
Trustees in an effort'to determine
what is bestxfor the -school, and w_e
hope that under no circumstances
will he penalize.the institution, its
faculty, and its student body to en'-
force his point of view."

Correspondence between the Board
of Trustees and the Governor is print-'
ed, the gist of which is that the Board
remains ﬁrm in its support of the pol-
icies of the University and its plan
for alumni representation. The state
chief executive, it is indicated," is.
adamant in us ultimatum that unless
15 alumni representatives are elected
to the Board, the University, will not
receive one cent of state appropria-
tion. ‘ 1 '
Pictures of the four alumni candi-
dates for two positions on the Board,
biographies of each, and regulations

former investigator for the S8118-LG. I 
Munuitions Committee; Dr. B. j'J..‘ - V

nard C. Clauses, pastor of the -First‘ -_,

and urged students to ally themselves y

Advocates ‘Change In System

Said Dr. Hovde:' "Peace, dignity,’
and strength are what we- must at-=
tain . .1 But there is at present an
war at home—the struggle of our
young ‘lost generation’ for an oppor-
tunity. to work Dedicate your
lives to changing this system so that ' 
we may have work for’, all. If this is“, ’ 
done, We will have peace.” ' ~- , v
Describing his audience as an “over-,,,.,
advertised group,” Mr. Raushenbush 
told how practically everyone had id-e,-.' ' '
«cided that death was the young per-_ ' " 1.

death at that. , . . ,
“You will ﬁght," he claimed. “But.
the question is why; and where; for, ,
whose beneﬁt; and whether you will _,
have anychoice in the matter . . . '
You will die because peace costs ‘too ,
much;- because we couldn-’t afford to ‘
lose our trade.” « 1

He told how absolute neutrality leg‘-
islation had been voted down in Con-
gress becauuse of a possible loss in«
foreign commerce,,’.and how Depart-'
ment of State andéarmy and navy oili-
cials were handiingﬂour foreign rela-
tions, especially in the Far East, with‘-
a “penny diplomacy”»attitude. The; .
speaker objected vehemently to , as, 5-.'= '
statement that college students could ~
be persuaded to ﬁght by interestedin-, '
dividuals with suﬂicient money in ,
four weeks. “I give them six weeks.” , A.
Mr. Raushenbush advised young .1
people, in the few moreyears they
have of it, to use that time in reor-,~ , .
ganizing society so that it would not’ ‘H 1 ~
be “poor” and thus perhaps postpone _
the end. . ., ,
Clausen Stresses “Hard Battlq"
Rev. Clausen then drewan analogy;
between the college student's enthu- .
siasm in athletic competition and his _, , _
degeneration after graduation into a.   -
weakling without ﬁght, , i _
Football games are insigniﬁcanté 
because you know that no'mattei“' .
how good your team is, it can always7‘ ,’ ',
be beaten by a better paid team and"  
coach. But there is no fun in beating‘

an unworthy opponent. Pick some- .
thing difficult and beat it, he insisted. .
He suggested economic readjust-
ments, civil liberties, and opposition‘

to all wars as a few of the things _
worth fighting for." ‘ ‘  .
Goldberg concluded the mectingby  
proposing: “What we can do about it.”  
The government is spending $125,006 _ ' -:

said; bills are being introduced to

“But some of us think of running -
away from it all. We can't all hide

And some of

deep down in our hearts that we can

ht EGARDLESS’ OF the justice or injustice of the re-
 cent action taken at the University, it is a pity
that the student body should lose the services of the
two -such able men as Dr. W._ M, Parrish and'Richard
 Murphy. It will be diﬁicult indeed to replace the man
who has done’ excellent work at the head of the public
speaking department for the last 12 years. Nor will it
A be _‘easy to ‘find a subs_titute'_for his assistantin coach-
ing-th.e debating team these past eight Y€‘€lI‘S- _
 Together these men have turned out debating teams
“year. after year which have been an excellent adver-
ti-sim'ent of the University. Dr. Parrish has acquired a
7n'ational~reputation for his work in public speaking. He
ftlas been on the board of the National Public Speaking“
Con-ference and has served twice as cliairman of the
‘Eastern division. _

_VVe who are students here should find it regrettable
that Dr.‘ Parrish felt that conditions at the University

avorite Roles In Pitt Delegation;

3,000 Track Performers Enter Two-Day Meet .

 

Ten Panther trackmen, invade the rebuilt Franklin Field track
today and tomorrow for the 42nd annual running of the Penn Re-

‘ ‘lays. The track is reputed to be one of the ﬁnest in the country, hav-
ing been built especially for the Relays at an expense of $6,500.

It is reported by H. Jamison Swartstchairman, that 3,000 run-
ners, jumpers, and weight. men, representing 480 colleges, universi-
ties, and prep and high schools, have ﬁled entries for the 67-event

program, Committees in charge cut
15_events from.last year’_s program to
insure more interest to the thousands
who are expected to be on hand start-
ing "with the ﬁrst College relay cham-
pionship at 3 -o’clock this afternoon.

Coach Olson has entered the Pitt
squad in virtually every relay event.
but will not decide until nearer meet
time just how many of those relay
calls he will answer, depending on the
strength of his boys in the early
events_ ,

Fassinger Lone Discus Entry

Gene Taano is being played up in
Philadelphia papers as “the boy to
watch in the javelin.” Taano, last
Saturday, astounded the scribes with
his nonchalanf ‘>10-font practice heave
while the cameras were grinding
away snaps of his style. He will
probably receive his stiffest competi-
tion from Clark of the University of
Richmond, who was credited with a
toss of 213 feet in the Junior Nation-
als last year.

Pete Bennett will have defending
champion Threadgill to match jumps
against in the high jump. These two
tied in last Saturday’s Pitt-Temple
duel at six feet, two and one-third
inches. This event, number 66 on the
program. is set for 2 c-‘clock, tomor-

The quarter-mile, distance-medley,
sprint-mecllc:.', and discus events will

cus for the Panther’s lone competitor
in’ the weights. .

F ormer Football ‘
Stars ‘Signed Up’
For All-Star Tilt

Bill Kern, serving his fourth suc-
cessive year as coach of the all-star
alumni team that tackles the present
crop of Panthers in the ﬁnal game of
the spring drills, spends much of his
time these days lining up a gang of
“vets” to toss at the varsity on May 9.

The game this year has been
opened to the public and Will be play-
ed in conjunction with the Pitt-Notre
Dame track meet als scheduled for
the Stadium that Saturday. Track
hostilities will start at 1 o'clock, giv-
ing way to the footballers who take
over the ﬁeld at approximately 3:30
o'clock. ’

An admission charge of 50 cents
will be made for all spectators, and
there is expected to be a large turn-
out for the affair. '

Hoe! Wil-I Be Back

Bob Hoel, varsity tackle on the 1933
crew, notiﬁed Kern that he was rarin’
to go, but would not be able to attend
the Thursday and Friday practice ses-
sions previous to the game. Hoel is
employed by a stock brokei-’s concern
in Chicago, but will “knock off work
to get back there with the gang.”

Captain Dick Matesic, leader of the
all-stars, ﬁgures that th: “old men will
give the youngsters all the defensive
football they can handle. They will
have to watch our halfbacks, too, for
offensively we might give them a sur-
prise or two,” the scrappy alumni
‘leader reported. -

Howdy O’Dell, who only‘ recently
_ coaching
duties at Harvard‘, will return to
Pittsburgh for the game, and with
him will come Jim MacMurdo and Rip
Collins, who .are at present working in
Boston, Massachusetts. ,r

Tar _Onder, ’33, a teacher at Jean-
nette, and Bob Hogan, ’33, a dentist
at Meadville, plan to participate, as

Soph -Sophties Are Not‘ So Soft;
Defeat Phi Delts, Kappa Sigs

Tagging on another surprise to the
year’s big list of upsets, the _Sophties
performed the unexpected in the In-
tramural basketball tourney Tuesday
by nudging out Phi Delta Theta, 29-
27, and in so doing winning the Intra-

~ mural cage championship.
Not given just consideration in pre- -

tourney reckonings, chieﬂy because
this was their ﬁrst year of activity in
the Intramural cavalcade, the Soph-
ties ended up in a share-the-ﬁrst-place
plan with the Newman Club in the
Independent League standings. Then,
in the championship play-offs, they
defeated the Newmans and went in to
show their class to the leaders of the
other Intramural leagues. ‘

On Monday" they concocted the big-
gest mix-up of the tournament form
sheet by handing out a severe lacing
to Kappa Sigma, 29-18. Kappa Sigma
was notonly the Greek champion this
year and defending Intramural champ,
but also the odds-on.favorite to re-
peat their Intramural conquest

Phi Delta Theta, Greek rm-.ncr-up
and League B titiist, came into the
ﬁnals on a similar upset. In Monday’:-3
semi-ﬁnals, they surprised the Chem
Engineers, 26-23, in two overtime pe-
riods.
were runners-up to the Kappa Sigs.

Whirling away to a lead in the ﬁrst '

few minutes, the Sophties ﬁnished the
ﬁrst quarter in front of the Phi Delts
by setting a 9-3 pace. The insertion
of Biff Glassford into the Phi Delt

lineup braced their scoring punch and V

the ﬁrst half was completed with the
Sophtie lead out to 14-11.

The Sophtie margin became inse-
cure in the third period when the Phi
Delts pulled up to 17-16. “Muzzie"
Marcus ﬂipped in a one-handed shot
from the side to make it- 19-16. 'But
just before the period ended, mild-floor
baskets by Glassford and Anderson
forced the Sophties to -surrender their
lead.

The Sophties pounced out of their

corner for the ﬁnal period with a hop‘

and a jump and opened up a ball-pass-
ing attack that fairly sizzled.‘

Symonds, rated at number one on

lowed with a 78.

-Bob Mease, playing at number ﬁve
for the second consecutive year, was
second to Symonds as he shot a 77 to
defeat Stein of Tech by a compara-
tively wide margin.

Other Pitt men to break 80 were
Johnny Wasco with a 78 and Bob
Baughman with a 79. Only Nevin Pal-
ley of the Tartans was able to match
this record.

Frank Souchak, end on‘ the football
