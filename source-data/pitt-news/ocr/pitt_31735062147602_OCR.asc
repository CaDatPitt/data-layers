Med Applicants
Face Interviews

Varied Standards Feature Plan,
Says Dr. Held, Landing It

According to Dr. Omar C. Held, per-
sonnel assistant to the dean of the
College, all applicants to the Univer-
sity School of Medicine must arrange
for personal interviews to be given
between April 15 and April 24.

Dr. Held pointed out that applica-
tion blanks may be obtained immedi-
ately, and arrangements should be
made for the interview with him.
After the interview, he continued, stu-
dents appear before the admissions
board of the School of Medicine.

Interviews with the admissions board
will be held some time in May. At
this time applicants will be accepted
or rejected on a basis of recommen-
dations of their science teachers.
scholastic record. and the scholastic
aptitude test, which all applicants
took last’December.

Dr. Held emphasized that the pres-
ent system of science recommenda-
tions has proved to be one of the best
bases of procedure. Rather than wait
until the student applies to a medical
school, the science teachers ﬁll out
rating bla.nks from year to year, based
on personality, character, and scien-
tiﬁc aptitude.

“Under this system,” Dr. Held con-
cluded, “we have increased the exact-
ness of these recommendations. Pre-
V1'01lS1)'. the grade was the only basis
upon which students could be judged,
after an absence from the teacher’s
class of several years. VVith this year.

are able to receive better recommen-
dations resulting in order and added
beneﬁt to both student and adminis.

tion of students under the leadership
of Miss Genevieve Blatt, graduate as-
sistant in political science.

Same Bands Sign
For Military Ball

Music of Stem, ‘Hot-cha’ Gardner
To Feature Dance On April 22

Harold Stern’s and “Holi-clia"
Gardner’s orchestras have been sign-
ed to play at the Military Ball the
night of April 22.

No, this isn’t a repeat of one of

tlieflood editions of The Pitt News,
and it’s not the work of an absent-
minded reporter. Stern and Gard-
ner really will play at the Ball, after
all.
---Howard’-“hutz; "C36, -chairman,‘ said
Monday that “the committee is at-
tempting to contact two bands every
bit as good as the ones we had if
they won't sign up.” He breathed a
sigh of relief Vvednesday, when he
realized that he wouldn’t have to go
orchestra-hunting after all. Lutz ad-
mitted: “It surely would have been
tough to ﬁnd two ba.nds as good as
these. I’m glad we don’t have to do
it.”

According to Harvey Goldstein.
C37, publicity man forl the dance,
Stern will play in the large gym,
while Gardner will be stationed in
Thistle Hall, both on the Carnegie.
Tech campus.

Plans a.re going forward as if
nothing had happened, Lutz says. No
local bands have been, or will be
signed. The favors, which became
such a worry to the’ committee as
flood waters bathed the city two
weeks ago, will ﬁnally be put to the
use for which they were intended.

Lutz made no statement on the
fact that the date for the Ball, April
22, is the same as that for the open-
ing of Cap and Gown (and also the
same as that of the peace strike),
but Goldstein retorted that since
Wednesday has been designated as
Graduate Night, very few students

will be inconvenienced, and, as for
the boys in the show, they could
easily attend the Ball after 11:30
o’clock.

Druid Petitions Ready
For Eligible Freshmen

Second-semester freshmen may take
out petitions beginning Monday for
membership to Druids, national soph-
omore honorary fraternity, according
to Frank Engel, E38, president.

The new men elected at this time
will be tapped a.s a regular part of the
Tap Day ceremony on May 1, during
Spring Festival Week.

Approximately 15 second-semester
freshmen will be tapped at this time,
and will be active during the school
year of 1936--37. A high rating in ac-
tivities, scholarship, and character are
requisites for election. ’

Petitions will be due soon after the
end of the Easter vacation. After an
interview with each petitioning can-
didate, Druids will elect tappees ‘by
the new procedure, used for the ﬁrst
time last semester.

First Senior Ball Mjzeting
Open To Class Members

Seniors will get a chance today to
aid in selecting the orchestra, ball-
room, favors, and decorations for the
ﬁnal major event of the school year
at the ﬁrst meeting of the committee
in charge of the affair.

“Any senior with ideas (they’re
hard to ﬁnd. they say) is invited to at-
tend our first meeting.” says Charles
Ebert. C. chairman. The group will
meet at 3:30 o’clock today in Room
821, Cathedral.

Preceding this ﬁrst regular meeting,

vLen Mahlvern’s Orchestra

To Play For Dance
At Grotto Tonight

The -year’s * champion‘ dance-leading
couple, Beverley Brown, C37, and Paul
Keiser, C36, will make their ﬁnal cam-
pus appearance tonight at the Col-
lege Association informal, scheduled
to begin this evening at 9 o'clock at
the Grotto Ballroom ‘on the North
Side.

A new band in University circles,
Len Mahlvern and his Society Club
Orcl1estra,_, will furnish the music.

Says dance-chairman Keiser, ‘‘Al-
though Mahlvern’s band is making its
first appearance on the campus, I un-
derstand, from authentic sources and
otherwise, that he has one of the ﬁn-
est bands in the district.”

Backing up his statement, Keiser
points out that Mahlvern has had ex-
tended engagements at school dances
and night clubs in Ohio and West Vir-
ginia. Locally, he has played at -the
Pittsburgh Country Club and many so-
ciety functions.

Declares Keiser, “The dance this
evening will be a spring sports dance.
Any style dress is permissible, or
‘anything goes.’ Fellows can wear
sweaters, light trousers and white
shoes. You don’t even need a coat."

Price ‘Is $1 A Couple

This year the College Association
has made it a policy to, hold dances
and charge only $1 per couple, and
yet have an orchestra that will please
everyone. The proceeds from each
dance are deposited in a loan fund
from which needy students may get
loans up to $50, without paying a pen-
ny of interest.

Remarks Keiser, “So far this year
We have aided many students, just as
the loan fund assisted hundreds dur-
mg the past few years to continue
their education.”

Although tickets will be on sale at
the door, tickets may still be obtain-
ed from the following undergradu-
ates: Keiser, Edwin Beachler, Doris
Evans, Ted Whitaker, Beverley Brown.
William Hughes, Lucy Conn, Anthony
Lﬂucas," Anne «June Elmei‘,"'"l'\7Iai"tlia
Fuller, Elinore Humphries, Gertrude
Sche-in, Charles Smullin, Raymond
Scheib, Sally Brunson, John MacDon-
ald at the Engineering School, Bill
Daufenbacli, dean of men’s ofﬁce in
the Cathedral, and the College office
in State Hall.

Concludes Keiser: “This is the last
chance to attend a campus dance be-
fore the Easter vacation rolls
around.”

SFA Social Body h
Plans To Publish
All School Events

As its latest project, the Student-
Faculty Association social committee
has arranged for publication of all
University events. This calendar will
be published in each issue of The
Pitt News and will also be kept on
ﬁle in the office of the dean of men,
Room 801, Cathedral.

According to William McQuade,
E37, chairman of the committee, the
following rules will govern this serv-
ice: regularly scheduled events need
be registered only once, but they will
be published according to schedule.

’Events must be registered by 4
o clock, three -days before the publica-
tion of The Pitt News in which it is
190 appear. The ﬁrst publication of
the calendar, will be in the April 6
issue of The Pitt News; therefore all
blanks listing events must be in the
office by 3:30 o’clock today.

McQuade said yesterday, “E-very ac-
tivity of every organization should be
published in this calednar, thereby
enabling all members, as well as other
students, to follow all the activities
of all organizations.”

Students To Visit
Van Gogh Exhibit

Elliott Takes Charge of Cleveland
Trip Under Fine Arts Group

 

 

From 30 to 35 University students
will embark for Cleveland from the
Pennsylvania Station at 8:30 o’clock
Sunday morning to view the fa.I11Ol1S
Van Gogh paintings on display there.

The trip is being sponsored by the
department of ﬁne arts, with Philip
C. Elliott, assistant professor of ﬁne
arts, in charge. The train will arrive
in Cleveland at 11:30 o’clock, and will
start back at 5:08 o’clook from the
Euclid Street st.ation.

In the coiijoining car, according to
Mr. Elliott, there will be a group of
Carnegie Tech students, if present
plans on the Forbes Street campus
carry through.

The life of the artist whose works
will be seen was one of tragedy. Van
Gogh was the son of a Dutch Protest-
ant pastor. After an unhapm’ boy-
hood, he tried his skill as a picture
salesman and French tutor, in neither
of which he succeeded.

For several years, he was a stu-
dent in a theological school, and then
an evangelist among Belgian miners.

At 28 years of age, he became a
painter. Gauguin, a. friend of his, and
he used to quarrel over art. They
differed entirely in their viewpoints.
On one ocasion, Van Gogh threatened
Gauguin with a razor, and in remorse,
cut off his own ear.

He ﬁnally went insane, and was
sent to a hospital. Not long after, he
committed suicide by shooting himself.

He represented the school of ex-
pressionism, or “pure, uncensored
spontaneity.”

Inquiry Hears other Ross  
Analyze Religious Freedom

 

America, according to Rev. J. Elliot
Ross, who spoke Wednesday at In-
quir.V Forum, began with a unique ex-
periment in the ﬁeld of religious be-
lief. No oﬁicial religion was set up,
a.nd no co(le of orthodoxy enforced
upon all citizens. And because of this
there has been freedom of religion in
the United States.

"Oiﬁcially,” Father Ross continued,
“we have not always lived up to our
standards. Sometimes the Masons
Were subjected to pressure by other
groups; sometimes the Catholics,
sometimes the Jews. But on the
whole we have been fairly constant to
the separation_of Church and State.”
. However‘, after the war this liberal-
IZIDS HJ0\'eme11t Was somewhat check-
ed. Especially was this true in Euro.
pean countries. “Instead of the state
recognizing the church. the state in
Germany, Italy. and Mexico represent-
ed itself as oninipotent. absolute. It
could do no wrong. It is the concept
of a totalitarian state, and the men
who founded the United States were
opposed to a concept such as this.”

In the past in America Father Ross
maintained, the liberty of conscience
of the individual was unquestioned.

During the Civil VVar, for example, the
military draft did not sweep into the
army all men, regardless of their per-
sonal opinions_on war, as happened in
1917. He cited the case of Professor
Macintosh of Yale, who was refused
his ﬁnal citizenship papers by the Su-
preme Court because he would not
take a blanket oath to take up arms in
defense of the country.

“These are indicative of forces
working for a more absolute state
than our forefathers intended,” he
concluded. .

When asked what was his opinion
03 loyalty oaths, Father Ross answer-
e :

“I suppose that, if you consider
teachers in state schools as civil oili-
cers, they should take an oath just
the same as any other government oili-
<‘1'a1S. However, I see no reason for
loyalty oaths. and I suspect that they
are part of the totalitarian idea.”

Fatliei' Ross warmly defended pri-
vate schools, holding that if a school
was supported by the state, the state
would ultimately exert authority over
it. He believes that a universal, state-
controlled educational system would
not be conducive to real freedom.

Election Etiquette

ITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT today of
 40 men and 20 women who will vie for

the 30 seats in the Student Faculty As-
sembly in elections on Friday, April 17, the
campus political race comes to a boil. From
now until the polls close two weeks from to-
day, there will be considerable conjecturing
and planning, while campus jargon will pick
up such words as “slate,” “coalition,” and
“ticket,” to leave them limp and overworked
in a fortnight.

It’s all very good fun, and so highly does
the spirit mount that by the election date
everyone is ready for a genuine Roman holi-
day. There could, in fact, be a most interesting
book written about problems and practices
of voting days on the campus. Spicy chapters
in this tale would tell of how registration cards
were battled for and how one fraternity group
took the ballot boxes home to lunch with them
and returned the boxes with a few additions
and corrections made inside.

In an effort to combat much of this, SFA in-
stalled a new system of voting last year,
whereby each student signed a card at regis-
tration and had that card checked off as he
voted. This year the task of inserting those
cards into the registration procedure became
something of a “let George do it” affair, and
George fell down on the job.

Now it appears very likely that this year’s
election will return to the old form of having
the voter present his registration card to get
a ballot. The difficulties here, it may be ex-
plained to the uninitiated, are that so many
people are anxious to borrow your registration
card.

_Two years ago, when the new deal mania
hit Pitt politics, deﬁnite attempts were made
to curb the card-borrowing practice. Less than
1S minutes after the polls opened, the ﬁrst
“irregularity” had been detected and immedi-
ately all wires of the grapevine telegraph
werebuzzing with the warning “Vote with
your’ ‘own registration card, or you’ll be
caught”

About half a dozen students ran into the dif-

jﬁculty of voting with someone else’s card or

having someone else vote on their cards. These
;spent- some anxious hours in the dean of men’s

-office worrying about the nature of the pun-

ishment to be meted out to them.

The moral of this little piece is “Hang on to
your registration card.” That’s a cardinal rule
in Pitt election etiquette.

I Editorial Of The Week I

~ The Idler’s Art in Education

The‘ average person thinks that the University’s para-

realize that a higher purpose of the University is to
teach individuals how to live better.

There are so many things in this world which are en-
joyable.- Mixed up with the splotches in life’s picture is
a lot of ﬁne color. And the reason a lot of us don’t see
anything bu-t the smudges is that we have come to think
that activity is worthless un-less it is required or is mate-
rially productive in an immediate sense.

Many of us were urged to think in these terms very
early, learned to play marbles for keeps when kids, and
never got out of the tendency to avoid that activity
which does not yield something which can be taken home
in the pocket.

Learning how to relax—-take pleasure in superﬁcially
unproductive activity—is one of the important lessons
of more pleasant living.

Onedoes not have to resolve to be a loafer, in the
highly prejudicial sense of the word, to leain to relax.
There is an art to good idling, the kind which gives your
sensibilities a chance to exercise themselves, affords the
setting for the cultivation of an appreciation for beauty
and the tendency to look for the inspirational rather
than the sordid things in the panorama of society.

The means to pleasant living these days cannot be
completely divorced from the dollar mark. But the stu-
dent who abandons or ignores the sources of beneﬁt in
the idler’s art for nothing but the search to make a bet-
ter living does himself an injustice. And what he gets
out of the University cannot be properly be termed a
higher education.

On Applying For A Job

i

Long-range applications for positions must be like
personal visits according to Theodore A. Siedle, assist-
ant dean of the school of education and director of the
teacher appointment bureau at the University. Address-
ing senior women in the School of Education, Professor
Siedle explained 10 cardinal points in writing letters of
application for positions.

“Since getting a position is ‘selling yourself,’ you will
have to use the methods of the brush salesman or those
of the college student who sells aluminum ware during
the summer vacations to work his way through college,”
Mr. Siedle told the senior women. “These folks make 10
to 20 calls and get kicked off steps or have the doors
slammed in their faces as many times before they make
one sale. Similarly, you will have to Write 10 or 20 let-
ters before you get one contact.’’

‘‘If I were to paraphrase a popular slogan,” he con-
tinued, “I would change ‘Don’t write—telegraph,’ to
‘Don’t write——make personal visits.’ However, since you
may be asked to put occasional applications in writing,
I shall try to show you what to do when you use a letter
as a means of increasing job opportunities.”

Mr. Siedle’s 10 cardinal points about writing letters
of application are:

1. Know the person to whom you are writing—his
peculiarities, his likes, and his dislikes.

2. Know the full name, initial, and correct title of the
person to whom your letter is addressecl——use them, and
by all means spell the name properly.

3. Select the proper stationery——a good grade of
white paper, size 81A;x11 inches should be used.

4-. Plan your letter carefully before you start to write.
Visualize your reader, remembering that you must ap-
proach each person in a different way, then write in an
easy, conversational manner. Be yourself. _

5. Frame your letter in an attractive manner and in
keeping with recognized practice. Be sure the mechan-
ical aspects of your letter———the parts and the punctua-
tion of them—are in keeping with recognized practice.

6. Typewiite your letter unless speciﬁcally requested
to write it in longhand. If you cannot use a typewriter,
have somebody typewrite it for you. Nothing looks
worse than a letter poorly written by an inexperienced
typist.

7. Restrict your letter to one page, and use an open-
ing that will attract attention and a close that will
clinch your appeal. Letters more than one page in length
are seldom necessary and infrequently read.
necessary and infrequently read.

8. Remember the ﬁve C’s of good letter writing——-
clearness, conciseness, completeness, correctness, and
courtesy; clearness without lengthy details, conciseness
without being abrupt, completeness without being ver-
bose, correctness without being superciliously meticu-
lous, courteous without being gushy.

9. Avoid business “lingo.” Your letter should be.writ-
ten in ordinary English. There is no such thing as busi-
ness English.

10. Sign your letter with ink and be sure that you do

sign it.

I Turns 0ut.‘Dud,’
Professor Grins

It was April Fools’ Day.

Harry Bash, C39, who sat in the
front row of his freshman English
class, bit the end of his pencil furi-
ously as he tried his darndest to write
an expository paragraph. Hilda ‘Beck,
C39, who sat beside him, wrinkled her
brow as she, too, tried her best to
carry out the assignment made by a
substitute teacher. In fact, the whole
group seemed to be writhing in
agony. ’

Suddenly, the entire class rose, fold-
ed their papers neatly on the pro-
fessor’s desk, and marched toward the
door. Just as Harry took hold of the
knob, the door was swung open from
the other side and in stepped VVilliam
G. Crouch, the regular professor. The
students turned meekly back to their
seats and Mr. Crouch picked up the
themes preparatory to class "discus-
sion.

All set to oﬁer the ﬁrst paper upon
the altar of criticism. he opened it
and there, written in big letters under
an unintelligible moniker, appeared
these words: “April Fool, grandma.”
The professor smiled as he leafed
through the ﬁle of papers, ﬁnding on
each one the appropriate greeting,
“April Fool.” '

“I guess the old college spirit still
exists.” declared Mr. Crouch good na-
turedly. “Well we can forget about
the assignment for today.”

Note 1: Mr. Crouch was delayed in
town after his car broke down.

Note 2: Mr. Crouch had a good sense
of humor.

1 Events Carded Tomorrow

 

20 High Schools Entered In 22nd Annual Championships;

Varsity, Frosh Natators Out To Set New Marks

Outstanding schoolboy natators
from 20 high schools will gather in
Trees pool tomorrow afternoon and
evening to participate, in the 22nd
University inter-scholastic meet. The
water carnival will begin promptly at
1:30 o’clock with trial heats in the 40-
yard freestyle event. 

With 14 out-of-town schools entered.‘
the meet is expected to be one of the
ﬁnest ever staged in W'estern Pennsyl-
vania. Erie Tech, defending title-
holder, leads a pair of schools from
that city, the other one being Erie

Strong-Vincent.
From Akron, Ohio, comes Akron
East, perennial contender for the

crown, St. Vincent High, and Hower
Vocational. Canton McKinley, win-
ner in 1933 and 1934, will bring a pow-
erful outﬁt as will North Canton.
Other
include Cleveland Heights, Butler,
Duquesne, Clairton, Turtle Creek, and
Homestead.

Fifth Avenue’s crack water team
heads the local delegation of six

schools, which consist of Allegheny,‘

Carrick, South Hills, Central Catholic,
and Taylor Allderdice. Coach Larry
Danver’s Fifth Avenue swimmers will
be among the favorites to take the
title.

Dobrowolski, Erie Tech star, will
return to defend his crown in the
100-yard freestyle; with him will be
three members of the championship
freestyle relay quartet.

Fifth Avenue’s state champion med-
ley trio, Lederste'i'n, Slobodian, and

Lupko, who ﬁnished third last year,

will be favored to take -the 180-yard
medley event tomorrow. This trio
broke the state scholastic record last
Saturday. Beacon, who took third
honors in the backstroke last year,
will be among the entrants tomorrow.

Wright, of Erie Strong-Vincent;
Souers, from Akron Saint Vincents;
Conger, from Akron West; and Ship-
hauer and Woyer of Akron East, are
a few of the other place-winners last
year who will be seen in action tomor-
row.

Finals in all events will be staged
in the evening along with the Pitt
championships. This affair was orig-
inally carded for last Saturday, but
lack of a sufﬁcent water supply forced
a postponement for a week. This
change proved a wise move, for it al-
lowed teams which participated in
the state meet last Saturday to enter
teams tomorrow.

In the Pitt championships, both
freshman and varsity swimmers will
seek titles. Captain ‘Russ Lindberg,
Tom Locke, Tom Anderson, and Red
McQuillan head a list of defending
titleholders. Lindberg will
crowns in the backstroke and 220-yard
freestyle events.

W. D-on Harrison, director of ath-
letics, will serve as honorary referee,
with Henry J. Blum acting as referee.
John T. Taylor, starter, P. T. Corr. di-
rector of meet, and other prominent
Pittsburgh sports ﬁgures will hold
down ofﬁcials’ jobs.

Olson Will Direct
Clinic Tomorrow

Track, Field Coaches To Gather
Here For Fourth Conclave

 

Coach 'Carl Olson heads 'Pitt’s second
annual track and ﬁeld clinic for the
beneﬁt of approximately 100 coaches
in the tri-state district tomorrow at
the track house. A training discussion
will open the seven-hour program at
10:00 o'clock, with the concluding
demons_trations scheduled for 4:00
o'clock.

Assistant Coach James Potts, Charles
Gongloff, Pitt Intercollegiate -javelin
champ.-and the varsity and freshman
track squads will take part in the
discussion and demonstrations.

A round table discussion has been
scheduled for the University cafeteria,
according to Olson, and will in all
probability be followed by luncheon
immediately following the showing of
motion pictures. ‘

The camera shots of both Pitt and
other collegiate track and ﬁeld per-
formers in action were taken by Potts
at championship meets. Some of the
ﬁlms date as far back as the 1932
Penn Relays.

At 10:30 o’clock, the group of scho-
lastic track mentors will hear about
the ﬁne points of “starting.” “Sprints
and relays” will be the most «impor-
tant items at 11 o'clock. The high
and low hurdle events will come in for
some attention at 11:30 o'clock.

Following the round table confab,
the high jump event will take over
the spot-light. Then, at 2:30 o'clock,
the coaches will discuss “broad jump-
mg.”

Talks on “shot puttting” at 3 o'clock.
followed by one on “javelin throwing,”
will lead up to the ﬁnal event on the
program, the demonstrations by mem-
bers of the squads.

Olson has planned the program “to
meet the needs of the majority of
men coaching track and ﬁeld in the
high schools of the tri-state area.”

Coaches who have already signiﬁed
an intention to participate include: A.
J. Evrhart, Uniontown; C. J. Coper,
Turtle Creek Union; Moe Rubenstein,
Ambridge; Hugh Lambie, Peabody:
Art lVIcComb, Aspinwall; W. E. Mc-
Clurg, Avalon: L. L. Russell, Langley;

Grid Candidates
Asked to Report

Second Football Call Issued Today

For Men To Increase Squad

Dr. Sutherland hung out a score of
“To Let” signs on a corresponding
number of the big steel-grey lockers
in the Stadium dressing room yester-
day. With the spring training drills
now well into the second week of con-
ditioning, the football coaching staff
is concerned with the unusual problem
of having a small squad of candidates
with which to work.

“This,” Dr. Sutherland explained,
“can be attributed to the many post-
ponements of the opening of the drills
due to unfavorable weather conditions
and the recent flood.” The first day
of practice was postponed no less than
ﬁve times before the squad could as-
semble for the initial work-out.

“However,” he continued, “now we
are faced with the problem of issuing
a second call for candidates. This
spring training starts with the funda-
‘me-ntals, and“ itvis an ex‘cellent'time
for prospective candidates to report
for instruction.”

It was also reported that candidates
who showed possibilities of develop-
ment would be invited to participate in
the early fall two-week session at
Camp Hamilton. ‘The camp is capa-
ble of accomodating more men than
the entire present squad of 45 mem-
bers, indicating that new prospects
will be given every opportunity to de-
velop into football material for the
1936 season.

Bill Kern, assistant coach, still re-
members those swell chicken dinners
and dishes of ice cream that the cook
serves every Sunday at camp and,
adding this to the football instruction,
they total a real experience for any
boy.

The squad at present can hardly put
four complete teams on the ﬁeld for
the signal practice that is at present
an important phase of the afternoon
sessions. In the past, Pitt squads have
carried at least ﬁve or six complete
elevens, sometimes having exceeded
100 men. .

Candidates should report immediate-
ly at the Stadium office for their
“suits” and locker assignments. The
drills will continue daily with the
exception of Sundays. Saturday prac-
tice has usually been called for the
afternoon, starting approximately at
1 o'clock.

Kappa Sigs, Phi Delt Fives
Win Frat Basketball Titles

Clicking with all ﬁve cylinders,
Kappa Sigma’s 1936 high-scoring ma-
chine rolled merrily on the way to its
second consecutive Greek crown by
lambasting Phi Kappa Tuesday, 48-20,
and clinching the championship of
League A. _ _

Last night League B’s toga was de-
cided when Phi Delta Theta knocked
off Delta Tau Delta, 27-22, in three ex-
tra periods to take the league title.
The Phi Delts meet Kappa Sigma
early next week for the Greek title.

Dietz To Address Forum

Monday's meeting of the Psychol-
ogy Forum will feature Dr. Alfred G.
Dietze, assistant professor of psy-

chology. Dr. Dietze’s* address on
“Are Individual Differences Really

Tonight at PAA

30 Eastern Conference Boxers
Entered In Tournament

Thirty boxers will be seeking indi-
vidual championships tonight and to-
morrow evening at the PAA when the
Eastern Intercollegiate Boxing Con-
ference holds its annual tournament.
The tourney was originally scheduled
two weeks ago, but the ﬂood washed
away the possibilities of having it
held at that time.

The bouts will get under way tonight
at 7:30 o'clock with preliminary round
matches, while the survivors from to-
night’s tussles will climb through the
ropes tomorrow night at 8:30 o'clock
in the ﬁnal matches. _

Mike Brutto, Mountaineer pugilist,
who copped the 115-pound National
Intercollegiate boxing title earlier in
the week, will be a heavy favorite to
repeat as flyweight king in this tourn-
ament. - -

The only champion to defend the
toga won -last year, Denver Welch,
West Virginia mittman, is expected to
receive stiff competition from Captain
A1 Paslowski, Pitt artist, who beat him
in the Pitt-Mountaineer duel earlier
in the season.

Abe Konick, Pitt, and Basso, W. &
J., lead the list ofrringmen-in the 135.
and 145-pound classes, while the ﬁght
for the 155-pound crown rates as a
toss-up. Dines, Pitt; Littlepage, West
Virginia; Reed, W. & J.; and Verga,
Bucknell, comprise the quartet of en-
trants in this weight division.

Brooks Ely, undefeated Tech mitt-
swinger, appears to have the edge in
the 165-pound class where his compe--
tition will come from Valentino, Buck-
nell, Leonard, Pitt, and Neilson, West
Virginia. -

Leading the candidates in the 175-
pound division is Skulos, W. & J ., while
Dickerson of West Virginia seems to
be the tops in the heavyweight class.

The entrants: 115-pound class—-
Brutto, West Virginia; Glenn, Tem-
ple; Stephano, Bucknell; and Wis-
niewski, Tech. 125-pound class—-
Welch, West Virginia; Paslowski,
Pitt; Parks, W. & J.; and Bailey,
Bucknell. 135-pound class—Konick,
Pitt; Conte, W’. & J.; Beck, Bucknell;
and Liebowitz, Temple.

145-pound class—Basso, W. & J.;
Blair, Tech; Ballard, Bucknell; and
Vacheresse, VVest Virginia. 155-pound
class — Littlepage, West Virginia;
Reed, VV. & J.; Dines, Pitt; Verga,

ginia; and Lin-de1'-ma;u, Pitt. Heavy-
weight——Dickerson, West Virginia;

Fresh Battle Culver

VVhile the ﬁnalists in ‘the Eastern
Intercollegiate tourney are battling
for titles Saturday evening, at the
same time up at the Stadium, the Pitt
freshman mitt team will be meeting
Culver Military Academy’s ﬁne boxing
team. The proceeds of the match will
be turned over to the Red Cross fund.

Coach Schricker plans to use Bon-
arati, Gray, Caruso, Ianuzzi, Bombe,
Halley, Lupinacci, and Lezouski
against the undefated military swing-
ers. »

The pairings: 115-pound——Weil, Cul-
ver. against Bonorati; 125-pound class

Golfers Begin Tri - Weekly

Practices On Alcoma Links

-Fairways, greens, and even sand-
traps taken three times each week is
the practice dose that Art Snyder, Al-
coma pro and newly-appointed Pitt
golf instructor, is giving his Panther
fairwa-ymen these days so that all
golﬁng ailments will be remedied by
the time the boys step up to the tee
for their opening match.

Drives are still in the process of be-
ing straightened out and putting
touches are yet being sharpened, so
that it is too early now to make any
deﬁnite predictions on what the start-
ing quartet will be. An almost certain
ﬁxture is Johnny Wasco, the only hold-
over from last year’s aggregation and
probably the most consistent per-
former in the group.

Another bright prospect is Art Sy-
monds, direct from the Stanford team
that even Lawson Little had a tough
time making a few years ‘ago. Sy-
monds is a senior transfer student
from the Palo Alto school and has
been turning in low-scoring practice
cards. Add Frank Souchak to this
list and then take your pick between
Morry Rosenbloom and Bob Mease and
you have a pretty good idea of Pitt's
golfing potentialities.
