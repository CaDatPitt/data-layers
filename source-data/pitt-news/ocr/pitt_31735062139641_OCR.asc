Greeks Complete
Week Of Silence
With 35 Pledges

Seidle Denies Unfounded Rumor
Of Fraternity’s Infraction
Of Rushing Rules

129 Receive Bids

The Greeks completed their si-
lence period yesterday afternoon
at 5 o’clock, ending an abbreviat-
ed mid-semester rushing period
by pledging 35 men.

One hundred twenty-nine bids

were extended to 92 rushees.

N. Robert. Seidle, assistant to the
(lean of men and fraternity adviser,
who has been interviewing the rush-
ees since Monday, said that the close
of silence period culminated in only
one unfounded rumor of an infrac-,
tion of the rushing rules being regis-
tered. A

Delta Tau Delta had been charged
with an infraction of the rushing
rules, the charge stating that the
Delts were guilty of pre’-rushing. The‘
rumor accompanying the charge said
that the Delts were to be ﬁned $100
and that they would be prohibited to
pledge any new men for 12 months.

Mr. Seidle said that this rumor is
absolutely without basis and vigorous-
ly denied. all charges.

The results of this year’s pledging
show a decrease of 144 men from the
number of men pledged the ﬁrst se-
mester of the school year '34-’35. The
total number of men pledged during
the whole ﬁrst semester was 179.

Mr. Seidle’s forecast on the number
of men that would accept bids was
35.

The results of the rushing are:

Delta Tau Delta: John H. Cheffey,
John Descalzi, George Siefers, Robert
O. VVilliams.

Kappa Sigma: John Hood,
Newman, Francis Filson.

Phi Delta Theta: Ross Garman, Wil-
liam Smale.

NewBus Ad Dean
Introduced Today

Tippetts To Address Assembly
During Free Fourth Hour

John

Students in the School of Business
Administration will meet their new
dean for the ﬁrst time publicly at a
general assembly this morning. Dr.
Charles S. Tippetts, the new dean,
will address the students during the
fourth hour in the banquet room of
Memorial hall.

All classes in Business Administra-
tion will be suspended during this
hour so that students may attend the
meeting.

Dr. Tippetts has annc-unced that his
address will be “a. good-will greeting
to all the stud_nts in the school.” He
will give a general outline of the his-
tory of business schools in America,
the objectives they have set up for
themselves, and the means they are
taking to achieve their purpose. He
will warn the students “against over-
specialization in one ﬁeld” and urges
them “to seek well-balanced, well-
rounded careers.”

The assembly was arranged by
M’ontford Jones, professor of ﬁnance
and acting dean before Dr. Tippetts
assumed oﬁlce, with a view to ac-
quainting the new dean with Univer-
sity students, faculty and organiza-
tions.

A number of other affairs have
been planned in honor of the new
dean. He will be introduced to mem-
bers of Alpha Kappa. Psi, business ad-
ministration professional fraternity,
at a dinner meeting on Thursday,
March '7; he will address members of
the Pitt Business Institute, business
administration student organization,
at a “get-acquainted meeting;” and he
will attend a smoker held in his honor
by the Business Administration
Alumni Association.

Cats Battle Tech
In City Title Tilt

Carlsonmen Seek Twenty-ﬁrst
Victory Over Tartan Cagers

A horde of -Scotchmen, clad in the
basketball equivalent of kilties and
bearing the banner of Carnegie Tech,
swoop into the Stadium tomorrow
night against Dr, Carlson’s Panther
cagers in one of the most important
games of the season.

To Tech, especially, victory over the
Panthers would serve as just the right
tonic to round out a mediocre Tartan
basketball season and avenge a string
of past Panther defeats longer than
one of Huey Long’s Congress speeches.
Twenty consecutive games, dating
from 1926, have found the Tartans on
the short end of the score.

The Panthers also have their rea-
sons for wanting this game. A victory
will lengthen their present winning
streak from 6 to 7 games, and also will
almost assure the Golden -Cats of their
third straight Eastern Intercollegiae
Conference title.

Coach Max Hannum will probably
send the same starting lineup tomor-
row night against the Panthers that
he sent against Temple Monday night.
This calls for Bill Spisak and Cy Fel-
ser at forwards, with Macalka perhaps
getting the nod in place of Fe1ser_ Big
Johnny Ewalt will probably start at
center and Captain Ted Rigg and Babe
'Patt will team at the guards. '

For the -Panthers, Coach Carlson
will again hand the usual ﬁve names
to the scorekeepers as his starting
lineup. Included in the ﬁve will prob-
Hughes and Ted
Rloderick, as forwards, Pete Noon, the
six-foot ﬁve-inch center, and -Claire
Cribbs and Ross Emrick. the Carlson
choice for the guard team.

 

60 Cap, Gowners
Survive Tryouts

95 Hopeful “Ballerinas” Unable
To Master Intricate Steps

VVielding his ax with as much im-
partiality as Mayor McNair shows in
chopping up City Council, dance direc-
tor Gene Kelly said “thumbs down"
on 95 aspirants of the dance, knocking
down the number of men still left in
the Cap and Gown elimination to 60».
Kelly said that approximately 20 more
would be weeded out of the 60 remain-
ing prospective chorines by Wednes-
day. ’

Kelly is well satisﬁed with the
progress of -Cap a.nd Gown to date.
At the last rehearsal of the chorus
Wednesday evening at the Y hut, he
commented favorably on the progress
of “In the Soup."

Kelly does not intend wasting time
in choosing the more complicated in-
gredients of “In the Soup.” Intricate
dance steps which featured the work
at the Tuesday and Vvednesday elimin-
ations proved to be the step-down for
65 per cent of the applicants. A com-
plicated, time step, a Schottische rou-
tine, and some intricate kicks were
the stumbling blocks on the weight-
reducing road to success in the terpsi-
chore. The next chorus work-out will
on Monday evening at 8:30 o'clock in
the Y hut.

In conjunction with Kelly's work
with the chorus, Theodore Viehman,
supervising director of the show, has
been holding casting tryouts for leads,
principal parts, and “spots.” Seventy-
ﬁve applicants for the cast turned out
for the ﬁrst castings on Wednesday
in Room 118, Alumni hall. Mr. Vich-
man said that a large percentage of
the applications show real acting abil-
ity and talent and that he hopes to
pick a few Barrymores, Gables, and
Hampdens out of the lot. Nobody was
eliminated until he had had a chance
at two reading with two different
parts,

Radicals Block
Labor Movement,
Williams Says

Unions “Do Not Fight
For Rights”

:___

“Communists are stymieing the la-
L 7!

bor inovemem.

“This is shown by their efforts to
incite the laborers in the various in-
dustries throughout the country to
radical movements,” David VVi1liams,
Pittsburgh representative of the
American Federation of Labor, told
the Inquiry forum Wednesday.

“If this group would put into pro-
gressive organization the energy it
expends in ﬁnding fault with it, it
would assist in the establishment of
better labor conditions,” he said.

Mr. \V’1lliams traced the ﬁght of the
AF of L in its attempt to raise the
status of the worker. He ﬂayed the
establishment of company unions and
government failure to pass legislation
assisting the federation.

The federation is composed of 109
unions, each with a degree of local
,auton0my. None of these is forced to
turn its business over to the AF of L
proper. The main authoritative body
in Pittsburgh is the Amalgamated As-
sociation of Iron, Steel and Tin VVork-
ers.

Commenting on the attitude of com-
panies in regard to labor, Mr. VVil-
liams said: “They have fought or-
ganization ever since I can remem-
ber and have used all their inﬂuence
against us. They have tried to re-
place our organization with company
unions. These are run at the ﬁrms’
expense, and are made up of non-
union men who will not ﬁght for their
rights.”

 

Strike Increase
Predicted

The American Federation of Labor
wants a showdown.

In securing it, strikes, militancy,
increased centr-.iliza.tion through or-
ganization into vertical unions and
probable formation of independent
unions not connected with AF of L
will mark the labor battle ﬁeld the.
next year or so. 

According to Jacob J. Blair, in-'“
structor in industry, it appears that
the AF of L is attempting to attack
President Roosevelt through Donald
Richberg. He believes they are en-
deavoring to maneuver the adminis-
tration into a stand on some deﬁnite
point by which labor hopes to gain the
support of the public. He said:

“The charge that AF of L does not
represent labor as a whole is correct.
Only one-sixth of the total number of
workers are included. Its inﬂuence
is perhaps somewhat greater than
mere size would indicate.

“Realizing this, the administration
has refused to allow the AF of L dic-
tate its labor policy. Naturally there
is friction.”

A.F.Of L. Speaker Claims Private’

[Thousands Cheer

 In Vain To See
 Fine Arts Show

Additional Movie Plans Announced
By Hovey After French
Films Draw 2,800

“The ﬁrst showing of artistic ﬁlms
by the department of ﬁne arts,” said
The Pitt News VVedne-sday, “was at-
tended by a capacity audience.” The
reporter’s observation takes its place
with the premature report of Mark
Twain’s death as the most gorgeous
of understatemcnts.

By “capacity audience” was meant
to be conveyed the impression of
2,800 persons jamming the Cathedral
with the largest crowd it has ever
held a.t one time.

At 7:30 o’clock Tuesday evening,
three-quarters of an hour before the
showing had been scheduled, a “ca-
pacity audience” of 250 had ﬁlled the
chairs of Room 817 and overﬂowed
into window ledges and ordinary
breathing space. By 8 o’clock, ele-
vator operators were refusing to car-
ry passengers to the eighth ﬂoor, and
corridors, both above and below, were
massed with more who sought an op-
portunity to see “Le Chien Andalou”
and “Poil de Carotte.”

According to Walter R. Hovey, act-
ing head of the department, a combi-
nation of factors probably brought
about such a huge attendance—the
fact that the ﬁlms were French, that
the people were sure of artistic excel-
lence, and that there was no admis-
sion charge. He said, “This seems to
p-rove deﬁnitely that Pittsburgh is
just as much interested in the artistic
as New York. It augurs well for the
possibility of the reestablishment of
a commercial movie house operated
from the artistic point of view.”

“However,” he continued, “this de-
partment has no plans for commercial-
izing our project. We shall continue
to hold a showing each -month. But,
since this is a ﬁne arts department,
we shall give preference to ﬁne arts
students and University students over
the general public, and we shall prob-
ably issue tickets. Of course we were
very gratiﬁed at the response. Our
future showings will be housed in a
larger room.” ,

The department has selected “Le
..'M,illion’ by Rene Clair a.s one of the
films for the next showing, if it is
available by then. The other picture
will be chosen from a list that in-
cludes “Sous Les Toits De Paris,”
Charlie Chaplin’s “Gold Rush,” Ru-
dolph Steiners “I-I20,” the Russian
ﬁlm “Road To Life” with an introduc-
tion by John Dewey, the surrealist
ﬁlm “Blood Of A Poet” by Jean Coc-
teau, and “Balais Mechaniques” by
Fernand Leger, the cubist.

 

Dents, Engineers
Schedule Dances

Webster Hall, Grotto Affairs Fill
Next Week’s Calendar

The Dents and Engineers take the
social spotlight next Friday with in-
formal dances at Webster Hall and
Grotto ballroom.

Engaged for the Dental Interfrater-
nity Council dance in the Oakland
ballroom is Teddy Brewer and his or-
chestr;-‘.. The Engineering Associa-
tion will feature Buzzy Kountz’s band.

Charles M. I-larnish, chairman of
the engineers’ dance, said that the re-
sult of the vote taken last week among
the engineers favored the selection of
a national orchestra for $1.50 a couple,
but the committee decided that the
tradition of Engineering Association
dances for $1 should not be broken.
“The success of this dance,” said
I-Iarnish, “will decide whether or not
national bands will be features of fu-
ture Engineering affairs.”

Buzzy Kountz and his orchestra have
played in Webster Hall, the Music
Box, and the Commodore restaurant in
Pittsburgh, and they have also had
engagements in Havana, Cuba, Cleve-
land, and Lake Placid.

The dance is open to all students of
the University, and tickets may be
bought for $1 in the dean of men’s
office, Room 801, Cathedral, in the
School of Engineering oﬂice, Thaw
Hall, and in the engineering seminars.

Teddy Brewer's orchestra, playing
for the Dental Interfraternity Council,
was recently featured over a coast-to-
coast hook-up on the Columbia chain
for a period of nine consecutive
months from New York. It was while
on Broadway that Teddy wrote “You”
are the song in my heart,” which he
now uses as his theme song.

Teddy and his orchestra have made
appearances over the East and Mid-
dle-West, playing in all the larger
cities. I-I.e has also played for the
major functions at Cornell, Colgate,
Illinois, and Purdue. Among other
major locations where Teddy has ap-
peared are the Bamboo Gardens,
Cleveland; the Village Barn, Empire
ballroom, and Young’s Chinese-Amer-
ican restaurant, New York city.

This is the ﬁrst time that the Inter-
fraternity Council has obtained a na-
tionally known band for its annual
function. Tickets may be obtained
for $2 at the Dental Inﬁrmary or from
the following persons: Karl P. Derr,
’35; Zelly Alpert, ’36; Ralph Deutsch,
’35; Jess Pennington, ’35; John Allen,
Jr., ’35; Dan Lonberger, ’36; A. Sebas-
tianelli, ’37; Walte1' H. Hart, ’37; Abe
Konick, ’37; or William Daufenbach
in Alumni hall. Derr and Alpert are
co-chairmen of the affair.

After Discard

Bulletin

Substantial concessions in
both the cost and the nature of
ﬁlms available for the campus
newsreel were made late yester-
day by the ‘Narner company
and the Executive committee
declared through Theodore NV.
Biddle that a further experi-
mental showing will take place
Vliednesday.

The campus newsreel theater will
be discontinued. The decision to
drop the project, begun two weeks ago
by SlFA, came after the last presenta-
tion on Vvednesday, when it became
evident that. because of the small num-
ber who had attended the two show-
ings, the receipts
would be insuffici-
ent to cover the
expenses involved.

At the two
screenings, which
were given at the
Schenley theater,

been selected by a
student committee
and which dealt

with subjects of

were presented. In spite of the fav-
orable impression left with students
who viewed the programs, only 254
students attended the ﬁrst presenta-
tion and 318 the second.

“The project was of an experi-
mental nature and was discontinued
because of the prohibitive expense
involved,” Charles Herald, C36, chair-
man of the SFA committee in charge
of the theater, explained.

“There will probably be no further
attempt, at least this semester,” he
added, “to promote a similar project.”

Published Report
Only Draft, Says
AAUP Secretary

Statement Still Awaits Correction,
Dr. Cook Declares In Exclusive
Interview With Pitt News

Must Yet Be Approved

By Special Correspondent

IVASHINGTON, Feb. 28—In an
exclusive interview today, Dr.
VV. VV. Cook, General Secretary
of the American Association of
University Professors, disclosed
to a representative of The Pitt
News that the Association’s oﬁi-
cial report on the dismissal last sum-
mer of Dr. Ralph E. Turner, associate
professor of history, will not be re-
leased until its publication in the
March number of the oificial Bulletin
of the Association, which will proba-
bly appear about March 20.

“The copy of the report that was
placed in Dr. Bowman’s hands for com-
ment was a draft only.” Dr. Cook re-
marked. “Even after his corrections
and those suggested by Dr. Turner
have been noted, the report as ﬁnally
written must be approved by our Com-
mittee on Academic Freedom and Ten-
ure and its publication authorized by
a majority vote of that Committee, or
it cannot be released as an official re-
port of the American Association of
University Professors.

The ﬁrst draft, the Secretary con-
tinued, is that submitted by the inves-
tigating sub-committee after several
months of collaboration in the prepara-
tion of its report. When a draft has
attained a form that is acceptable to
each member of the sub-committee,
and bears their unanimous concur-
rence, it is ﬁled with the Secretary.
I-Iis office then sends manuscript cop-
ies to the two persons immediately
concerned, with a request for factual
corrections and a statement that the
draft is a conﬁdential document and
not to be made public. It was one of
these copies that was made public by
Chancellor Bowman last week.

Report “Not Ready”

Dr. Cook emphasized that the report
in its present stage is not even ready
for the endorsement of the AAUP, The
corrections asked by Dr. Bowman and
Dr. Turner must ﬁrst be con-
sidered by the sub-committee, and
if they are believed to be valid,
the report is changed accord-
ingly. It is then circulated among the
members of the Association’s Commit-
tee on Academic Freedom and Tenure,
known as “Committee A.” The mem-
bers of this Committee make any sug-
gestions they deem appropriate, and ex-
press themselves individually on the
question of publishing the report. If
a majority favors publication, the re-
port as ﬁnally amcnded and approved
by this Committee is printed in the
next issue of the AAUP monthly Bul-
ietin. “Since a draft may be revised
in important particulars, any earlier
publication,” said -Secretary Cook, “is
premature and unfortunate for all
concerned.”

The members of the Committee on
Academic Freedom and Tenure, who
will pass on the report during the next
two weeks, are: Pr_ofessors Carl
Wittlte, Ohio State, chairman; Ralph
E. Himstead, Syracuse (chairman of

the investigating committee); J. P.
Lichtenberger, Pennsylvania; A. O.
Lovejoy, Johns lHopkins; Holland

Thompson, City College (New York);
W. C. Curtis, Missouri; ‘F. S. Deibler,
Northwestern; U. G. Weatherly, India-
na; Quincy Wright, Chicago; A. P.
Brogan, Texas; W. D. Hooper, Geor-
gia; S. A, Mitchell (President of the
AAUP); D. Y, Thomas, Arkansas; A.
M. Kidd, California; F. M. Padelford.
Vvashington (Seattle); and R. C. Tol-
man. California Institute of Technol-
OSY. Three are professors of history:
two. of law; two, of sociology; two, of
philosophy; two, of economics; one

each, of political science; English,
chemistry, zoology, astronomy and
Latin.

T IS possible to extract a creed
and a whole theology from ac-
counts of the two recent moving
picture ventures on the campus:
the SPA ncwsreel and tl.1e ﬁne
arts department’s restoration of
outstanding artistic ﬁlms. Vlfith
a subsidy, with generous advance
publicity, and with the good will
of a unanimous University, the
newsreel attracted between two
and three hundred admissions.
VvTltl'l equal good will and public-
ity, the artistic ﬁlms attracted
more than two thousand devotees,
who swarmed through the Cathe-
dral, put hopeless demands on the
largest space available, and, in
nine cases out of ten, went away
without seeing t.he two imported
pictures.

VVe believe as follows:

1. The further use of the 0&-
campus theater for newsreel
showings is unwarranted. If the
University Assembly have irre-
vocably taken up the idea of
ﬁlms, they should ﬁnd suitable
subjects and project them on a
smaller screen in such a room as
817, Cathedral. The space would
approximately ﬁt the audience,
and the admissions would possi-
bly ﬁt the cost.

2. The demand for ﬁne ﬁlms
should be supplied by the ﬁne
arts department of this Univer-
sity. The crowds, representing a
cross-section of Pittsburgh, who
tried to attend the ﬁrst showing
of foreign ﬁlms here in several
years, indicate a regular weekly
audience for this kind of ﬁlm.

The ﬁne arts department should
undertake, as a sort of extension
course, weekly showing of such
ﬁlms accompanied by lectures.
Enrollment in the course might
be by a small subscription. ‘Until
such a time as the Stephen C.
Foster memorial is ready for use
as an auditorium, the department
should rent Carnegie Lecture
Hall, the Twentieth Century Club
(non nobis solum sed toti mundo),
or, on a Sunday perhaps, the
Schenley theater.

VVe believe the department is
on the edge of an exciting experi-
ment.

 

Turner Petitioners Claim
University Hinders Action

Students sponsoring a reinstate-
ment petition for Dr. Ralph E. Turner
charged the University administration
yesterday with attempting to “keep
us moving,” although admitting no
student circulating petitions had been
asked to explain his actions and that
none of the petitions has been seized
or destroyed.

Over 100 names had been signed to
the petition yesterday and as soon
as 200 names have been secured it
will be presented to Chancellor John
G. Bowman. Sponsors said it would
probably be presented early next
week.

According to one of the Dc—titioners,
other students would sign the peti-
tion if they were not afraid of endan-
gering their scholarships or standing
in student activities.

Chess Club Tournament
Opens In Y Hut Today

The Chess club tournament. open
to all University students, gets under
way today in the Y hut. Arrange-
ments for the contest have been com-
pleted by Ben Goretz, C36, president
of the organization.

According to Goretz, membership
on the chess team and ranking in the
club will be based on points earned in
the tournament. ‘Information regard-
ingrules of the tournament is post-
ed in the Y hut. Anyone who wants
to enter the contest, and to become
a member of the club may still do so
by reporting to the Y hut office.

A tentative ch:-ss team has been
selected by Roger Ilsley, captain, and
Goretz. Other members a.re Sidney
Magram, Waldo Steiner, Albert Bran-
don, club secretary; Leonard Hepner
and Howard Goodman.

Club meetings are held every Fri-
day during activities period.

Memorial Scholarship

The Margaret‘ Enright Memorial
scholarship aw-.:rded each year by
Theta. Phi Alpha to a University
woman on basis of scholarship, lead-
ership, and activities, will be present-
ed by a Theta Phi Alpha alumnae on
Scholars’ Day, March 5. Students
wishing to apply may do so through
Miss Thyrsa. W. Amos, dean of women.

Lloyd Approves
Customs Rules
For Freshmen

By Alan Lloyd

HEN PRECISELY how would you;
go about installing customs?” he:

asked. I laughed and laughed and
laughed, like little .-kul:-rey, ‘"l‘l1at is a
sucker question,” I replied. “I wanted
you to ask me that all the time. This
is what I would do:

“First, let the new freshmen know
that the regulations are for their own
good——certainly they are no direct
help to anyone else.

will make the subsequent years richer
with friends, traditions, and spirit.
You know as well as I what emotional
appeal can be made on the subject.
Let the new students know through
our bulletins and pamphlets, through
the freslmian week lectures, at the
freshman banquet.

Let Doc Carlson speak to the men
and say, “Fellows, we’ve got a new
game here, a game you’re going to
like. It is a toss-up between being a
good sport and a baby.” Let the
Chancellor tell them how this school
is hoping to build new, richer tradi-
tions about these new people. Let
them feel that a great thing has come
to Pitt——-a. new group of students.
Make the measure one of pride, not
obedience.

“The second thing is to establish a
board of regents or judges to make
the rules and judge infractions. This
board must not be a bitter tribunal,
but a brotherly and fatherly talk. Let
the sophomores out——let the older
students, the interested faculty mem-
bers, the dean, be 011 this board. Dig-
nity, not belligerence, is the neces-
sity. And it would be a. duty of the
board to prevent hazing, for that
causes distrust and belligerence. If
the first class acts properly, I doubt
that they as sophomores will be the
vicious type that caused Pitt to drop
their customs years back.

“The third thing is to set up a
series of rules, with the reasons
given for their selections. I suggest
thepfollowing rules, and hope that
they may be considered soon:

1. To identify: Let every
freshman wear a blue and gold
cap when on campus, within these
limits: North, Center avenue;
West, Craig street; South, Forbes
StI‘6et; East. Meyran street.
These hats must be worn at all
public assemblies and contests,
and shall be removed before en-
tering any building.

This seems to be just. The campus
boundaries remove the metropolitan
restrictions, and since there shall be
no disﬁguration, such as hair-clipping,
no student need be embarrassed. It
is more than likely that freshmen will
be proud to wear their caps beyond
the required boundaries. The
boundaries are set‘, needless to say,
arbitrarily. The wearing of the caps
at public meetings is for recognition
and organization.

2. For participation and “get-
ting the right start”: Let fresh-
men attend at least half of the
major varsity athletics, unless ex-
cused by the dean, and all the as-
semblies of his school and of the
University. At such times, fresh-
men will sit in a group. and shall
not leave until the Alma Mater
is sung, and-until the upper class-
men have ‘left. The freshmen
shall know all school songs and
yells. Each freshman shall par-
ticipate in at least one activity.
This part‘ would not only keep the

student on campus more, but would
imbue the entire school with the re-
quired spirit. A unit of ﬁve hundred
or so freshmen at a football game
would be a marvelous aid to the
cheering section. For this, the songs
and yells must be. known, of course.

To put every student in an activity,

would be a large job, but at the pres-
ent time there is a group for almost
everyimaginable taste. Let discus-
sion and social and professional
groups enlarge their membership and
the result will be as good for the club
as for the freshmen. Let Quill Club,
John Marshall, the language clubs,
and the many others double their
size. If there is trouble ‘vith initia-
tion fees, let a settlement be made
with the school. Certainly in the
Cathedral plenty of meeting places
should be "available, with facilities
that will cut down membership ex-
pense.

3. To give dignity to the pro-
ceedings: Let subservience regu-
lations be made, such as use of
certain doors and sides of streets.
The removal of much congestion,

as well as the enchancement of upper-
class dignity, would be the result of
a few mild restrictions. The old idea
of not speaking to coeds, of buying
campus “passes,” and such should
never be tolerated.

Surely from these three principles
3. fair, inspiring set of custom regula-
tions can be installed here at Pitt
again. But—we cannot produce men
by paddling them!

National Honorary Society
To Meet Tippetts Today

Beta Gamma Sigma, national honor
society in commerce, meets today at
luncheon in the University club. The
occasion will be used to introduce
Dean Charles S. Tippetts to the so-
ciety.

The membership will vote upon
students from the junior class in the
School of Business Administration
who may have qualiﬁed themselves
for membership by virtue of their
scholastic records. The constitution
provides that "the maximum propor-

I tion of junior members to junior reg-

istration shall be limited to one-ﬂf-
teenth of such registration.”

The membership also will act on the
proposed amendment to the society’s
national constitution pertaining to
some of the deﬁnitions and classiﬁca-
tions of membership in the society.

A formal initiation ceremony fol-

lowed by a dinner will be scheduled,

for sometime late this month.

And they are,
good for the freshmen because they:

“Down With Hearst”
650 Miles An Hour

——— By Roman Lapica.

“Down With Hearst”
Some interesting “tacts" about Rus-
sia we-1'3 revealed to The Pitt News in

exclusive “Down with Hearst” inter-
views.
Declaring he could prove Hearst

“lies about Russia,” Robert XVhisner,
Westinghouse delegate to the Soviet
Union, said:

‘‘I saw more beggars in London in
30 hours than I saw in the Soviet
Union in 30 days.

"I met no hungry people there.
Everyone who works, eats.

“Every day thousands go to the-
aters. People who are hungry
don’t go to theaters.

“Workers above 55 are pcnsioned
in Russia. The average Working
day is seven hours. Men and women
are paid to go to school.”

Herbert Goldfrank, national secre-
tary of the Friends of the Soviet
Union who has just returned from
Russia, attacked Hea.rst’s “Anti-Soviet
l«‘orgery.” He asserted:

“The humorous story behind these
pictures of starvation in Ukraine is
that some of them have been iden-
tified as Polish war scenes.”

“Can you recall which ones were
identiﬁed?” he was asked.

“No, not offhand.” .

Mr. Goldfrank, discussing the “purg-
ing” of Russia following Kiroff’s as-
sassination, surprisingly charged that
the 114 condemned were arrested “be-
fore the slaying,” that the govern-
ment "knew of the attempted plot”
and that the prisoners were being
“held as liostages.”

Harvey O’Connor, author of MeIIon’s
Millions, left Russia momentarily to
spike Hearst as “the exploiter of war,
crime and lingerie.”

He blamed the failure of U. S. to
enter the ‘World Court on Hearst and
Father Coughlin, “Hearst’s mouth-
piece.” '

He deﬁned Hearst as “the advance
guard of Fascism,” cracked down on
the International News Service as a
“lying organization” and called Hitler
and Hearst “birds of a feather.”

Meanwhile San Simeon’s Sage re-
ports another increase in circula-
tion because of the Anti-Red cam-
palgn.

650 Miles An Hour

A speed of about 650 miles an hour
is the fastest man probably will ever
go at sea level in the pres‘ent,type of
ui1'cra'ft. _ . ' '-

This, according to Henry C. Pavian,
assistant professor of aeronautical
engineering, ably supported with
scientiﬁc proof and could have been
expounded “a hundred years ago.”

The professor, who came here from
California. where he learned to ﬁy,
said:

“If you double the speed, you
need eight times as much ‘horse-
power at sub-sonic velocities (be-
low the speed of sound). At super-
sonic spceds the power required
would be much greater.

“When you reach 650 miles an
hour, you approacn the speed of
sound. Above this rate, the air is
compressed, hindering further in-
crease in speed.”

Mr. Pavian saw little success in sub-
stratosp-here ﬂying in gasoline burn-
ing planes. He explained:

“Steam turbines are better ﬁtted
for use above 40,000 feet than gaso-
line engines. Near or above that
height, the volumetric efficiency of
the gas engine decreases to such
an extent that huge superchargers
are needed to blow oxygen into the
engine. These are heavy and cut
down power.”

War in the air, in Mr. Pavian’s
opinion, has been vastly overrated.
Attacking the eﬁectivcness of planes,
he said:

“A two-ton bomb dropped on the
Cathedral probably would knock off
the top two or three floors. A six-
inch artillery shell could do more
damage with a direct hit.

“The next war, if there is one,
will be fought much like the last
one.”

N 'l‘HF.' NIGHTTOVVN scene Joyce

has placed his characters in an
atniospliere of oppressive, sordid
vactiity. The terrifying atmosphe-.re of

lack of purpose and indulgence in
sensuality drags the characters to a
level which wars against life. The
utmospliere is so strong that Night-
town seems the victor; it succeeds in
establisliing death in place of even
mere existence.

But Joyce is not strong enough to
play his whole composition on the
basses; he drags in the sound of the
ﬂute. He has Mr. Bloom take Stephen
home with him; they talk. Mr. Bloom
is found to represent the scientiﬁc,
Stephen the artistic; and the happy
cooperation of the two is suggested,
for the Blooms recognize in Stephen
artistic considerations which are im-
portant to the world. Not only does
Joyce bring the scientiﬁc and artistic
together, he causes Mr. Bloom, whose
wife has been ztonsistently unfaithfiil
to him, to reassert himself; and there
is :2 suggestion that the domestic af-
fairs of the family will be improved.

But the sound of the ﬂute is thin
and weak. The earlier atmosphere of
decay has ‘been too strong, too un-
yielding to give way before a series of
sentimental maneuverings. It is as if
some supernatural hand—-it is really
Joyce’s hand——had reached down to
manipulate the characters.

Joyce’s Protective Armor-

Joyce is not to be strongly criti-
cized for his false sentimentality.
There are no writers of despair today
who are ready to face their basic
philosophy without the protective
armor of justifications, be the justiﬁ-
cations phrased in terms of art for
art, as with Picasso; or remembrance
of things past, a.s with Proust; or in-
tellect for the sake of intellect, as
with Paul Valery.

Joyce tries to save himself by jus-
tifying, as Edmund W*i1son says, man
and woman. He presents the fertile
Mrs. Bloom, who is ﬁnally attracted
t.o a man whom she considers to be,
in the profundity of his mediocrity, a
superior soul.

The surface frankness of Joyce's
representational method makes the
characters and action of Ulysses seem
far divorced from author manipula-
tion. The newness of the method has
_cau_sed .L11la_py,;__people to think, of the
charactersas actually put down by
nature. It has caused them to over-
look changes not only in mood but in
character, changes that, if set in a
more customary background, would be
immediately recognized. In considera-
tion of what goes before, we might
almost say that the conclusion which
Joyce has tacked on is satiric. But
Joyce is not satiric. He is arbitrarily
sentimental.

Supernaturallism And Sentimentality

Part, of course, of this sentimental-
ity comes from Joyce’.-; careful follow-
ing of I-Iomer’s Ulysses. When Homer
has ﬁnally placed his central charac-
ter in a. hopeless position, he intro-
duces all sorts of supernatural agen-

lope, excusing himself not at all for
achieving a. happy conclusion by un-
natural means. V-Vhen Joyce allows
all of his characters to become mired,
he resorts to his own manipulations

and in the guise of psychological

Expression Of Despair

By Herrymon Maurer

realism tries to pass off his happy
ending as a universal truth.

To understand why Joyce botliered
about modernizing Homer it is neces-
sary to recognize not only that he is
sentimental but that he is attempting
a. technical tour de force. Joyce-.’s fol-
lows Homer closely. The cllaracters
are the modern counterparts of
Ulysses and Teleniachiis and Pene-
lope. Each scene has its Honieric
parallel. In the scene at the hospital,
for instance, .lo_vce introduces a dis-
cussion of bulls and ﬁlls the chapter
full of 1'el’erc11ces to cat.tle to show its
relation to the sacred-cattle scene in
Homer.

That is, we are not only to grasp
Joyce’s ltnowledge of and reaction to
his characters; we are to admire the
mental gymnastics of the author; we
are to waste niuch time trying to ﬁg-
ure out precisely {O what incident in
Homer some passage refers. It may
be a great deal of fun to discover all
this, but it has no connection with
what Joyce is trying to say. It diverts
us from the matter at hand..
Intrusion Of Technique

Nor is this all that diverts. The
book is permeated by the a.ut.l1or’s
fondness for technique. There are in-
troduced into each chapter references
to organs of the body and references
to science and art. There are, in the
maternity scene, parodies on every
major English prose style, excused by
a possible symbolic connection with
the growth of the child from concep-
tion to birth. There is a great deal
of wit, wit in funny poems, even in
the respclling of riarnes.

But if we want to feel amusement,
if we want to feel a respect for clever-
ness——and technique unless it is one
with the content produces such feel-
ings-—we can wat-2.11 dancing monkeys,
or we can see how many words can
be formed from the noun anesthetic.
In Ulysses only too often the technique
intrudes. Some of the most despair-
ing passagcs trip along like children
running home from school. Even in
the midst of the Nghttown scene we
are moved to laugh. The effect of
Joyce’s prose is not a clear single im-
pact. Joyce lets us be hit twice. The
one blow makes us mourn; the other
makes us laugh.

Pitt Boxers Battle Badgers

Panthers Out To Add Third

Victory To Sea.son’s Record;

Wrestlers Meet Navy At Annapolis Tomorrow

 

By James

Fans who arrive at the Stadium at 7 :30 o‘clock tomorrow night
are likely to see one of the best collegiate boxing matches ever

pulled off in I’ittsb1n'gl1 when ti
punches with the V\"isconsin Bad

ie Panther boxers start swapping
gers. The match will take place

before the Pitt—’l‘ech basketball game.

Little is known of the powe
away in its ﬁsts because it is thei

r the \'\'isc-onsin team has packed
r ﬁrst. matcli of the season. How-

ever, judging from records made by“

the Badgers in other years they have
plenty. -

The Panthers hope to make this
match their third straight
the season. After dropping he open-
er to Syracuse the Panthers came
bac.-: and trounced VVasl1ington and
Jefi'erson and Temple, and tied Miami.

Two of the Panthers most gifted
boxers, Captain Jimmie G-iannatti and
Bernie Spiegel, v.7"-ll attempt to keep
their porter-.t records intact. Neither
boxer has lost a match this season.
Spiegel has won four bouts and lost
none and Gie.nnat.ti has won three and
lost none. Giannatti did not ﬁght in
the match with Syracuse.

Al Paslowski, 125-pounder, and

Cats Eon Count
With Owl Cagers

Cribbs Leads Panther Scorers In
34-25 Revenge Victory

 

 

The Owls of Temple university did
some pretty good hooting in their
:J.ame with the Panthers on the Sta-
dium ﬂoor Vvednesday night, but they
didn't play much basketball. The
ﬁnal score found the Cats ahead on a
34-25 count. The victory kept the
Carlsonmen in first place in the East-
ern Intercollegiate Conference title
chase.

After Jimmy Brown had counted a
ﬁeld goal for Temple in the opening
minutes to give the Owls a. lead,
Claire Cribbs started the Pitt scoring
with a ﬁeld goal and Skip Hughes add-
ed a foul to p-ut the Panthers ahead.
They stayed there for the remainder
of the game.

It was a pretty drab affair. They
called it basketball but almost any
other name would have served as well.
The Temple offense never did start to
click and the Cats were hampered
somewhat by the rough-house play
of the invaders. Casper was the only
man banished on personal fouls but
Juenger and Brown each came within
one violation of not ﬁnishing out the
game. Pitt made good on but 10 out
of 17 foul throw chances while the
Owl tossers missed out on only two
of eleven. '

After Skippy Hughes had put the
Panthers ahead by virtue of his foul
shot and a. ﬁeld goal, there was noth-
ing more to the game than keeping
score. Unless it might be. of course,
that sensational shot of Ted Roder-
ick’s just as the hands of the clock
were closing up on the ﬁrst half. Ted
stood beyond mid-ﬂoor and arched the
ball through the net with nothing
more than a swish of the net and a
gasp from the spectators.

Beginning in the second half where
they had left off, the Panthers kept
well ahead of the Philadelphians. Pete
Noon and Ross Emriclr were responsi-
ble for a large share of the second
halt‘, attack. Claire Cribbs was given
the nod as the leading‘ scorer of the
evening for the Panthers, sporting a
total of nine points in his list.

Hughes was not far behind with a
total of eight. Messikomer basketed
four fouls and three ﬁeld goals to
make him high-point man of the bat-

tle with 10 markers.
