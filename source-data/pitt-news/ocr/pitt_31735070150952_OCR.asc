The Pitt News Stay?’

Editor’s note: Last week, Student
Government Board Elections Com-
mittee chairman Aaron Gish ﬁled
an infraction complaint against
SGB President Gordon}.-ouderback
that mentioned Board members

aﬂiliated with a student group

known as the Druids. Because the
Druids are a secret society, little is
known on campus about the orga-
nization or its members.

This is the first of a two—part
series by The Pitt News looking
into who the Druids are and what
they do at Pitt. Part One provides
background into the formation,
activities and initial purpose of
the Druids in-an attempt to lend
context to their increasingly po-
litical involvement on campus in
recent years. '

A sophomore honors fraternity
formed by Pitt students nearly a
century ago has transformed sig-
niﬁcantly over the years, progress-
ing from a respected social delega-
tion in the 1920s into a sounding
board for elite student leaders in

' the ’70s. Most recently, it has be?

come a veritable secret society on
campus. 0

The Order of the Druids, origi-
nally founded in 1920 as an hon-
orary society to recognize “the
University’s outstanding men,”
according to a Student Organiza-
tion Resource Center webpage,
has generated everything from
admiration to suspicion among

the general student population at .

campus fascination with the group
has ebbed and ﬂowed, gradually,
fading between moments that

when cloaked ﬁgures made a rare

at last year’s Honors Convocation
as a former Druid.

Lately, visibilityof the now coed
organization has prominently re-

surfaced-, with societygmembers’ .

unannounced involvement, in
Pitt’s Student Government Board
becoming an element of discussion

‘ at an SGB]udicial Committee hear-

ing last week. But the Druids have
not always been anonymous, and
their inﬂuence on Pitt’s student
government has not always been
a source of contention.

Universities
express
concern  

over mayor’s

nonprofit tax

Pat McAteer
News Editor

A group of local colleges — including
Pitt — decried Pittsburgh Mayor Luke

Ravenstahl’s push to impose a nonproﬁt ’

tax on UPMC in an open letter sent over
the weekend.

The Pittsburgh Council on Higher
Education, a group that consists of 10
local institutions of higher education
in the Pittsburgh area, communicated
a sense of betrayal in the letter, saying
that they’ve cooperated with Ravenstahl
and the municipal government through
participation in the Nonproﬁt Sector
Support Task Force.

Ravenstahlformed the Nonproﬁt Sec-
tor Support Task Force late last year. It
consists of representatives from 30 non-
proﬁt organizations across the city. Its
stated goal is to determine how other
cities handle nonprofit institutions and
to make recommendations regarding how
the nonproﬁt sector within Pittsburgh
should support the city.

The formation of the task force was
mandated by the Pittsburgh Intergov-
ernmental Cooperation Authority, which
was formed in 2004 by former Gov. Ed
Rendell to combat Pittsburgh’s financial
struggles, according to its website.

The letter" also expressed concern over
the potential far-reaching effects of leg-
islation targeting large nonproﬁts within
the city of Pittsburgh.

“Your decision to bring a lawsuit chal-
lenging the tax-exempt status of UPMC,
while formally directed against only one
institution, has implications for the en-
tire nonprofit community, as statements

" made by other elected ofﬁcials make
- clear,” the letter said.

woman, said in an email that the mayor’s

of the Druids since his sophomore year at
Pitt, said he believes in the overall value of
the organization to the campus, as‘ a whole.

“They encourage good things of good
people that is always a beneﬁt to all, not
just the members,” he said. “Leadership-is
a skill that needs [to be] taught, encouraged
and mentored.” '

A bastion of campus leadership‘
Although few details remain about the
organization’s formation and early campus
involvement, it seems clear that leadership
and active participation in other on-campus
groups have served as core values of the
society since its inception. . "_ '
During their earliest years, the Druids
publicly hosted social events and special
guests including the chancellor and several
University deans. The Pittsburgh Press an-
nounced that Pitt’s 1928 homecoming dance
would be held “under the auspices of the
Druids” in an article from November of that
year. By the 19705, the group was still openly
acknowledged as an effort to bring leaders
together to promote scholarship, equality
and fraternity. ,
Thomas Bailey, of -the class of 1974, re-

calls that he was chosen as a Druid for his 1-
excellence in leadership within the student‘

government. He said he viewed the order
as an assemblage of leaders “looking to do
good things.” ‘

“I think [the Druids] are a good thing to

have, because it’s good for the leaders to get
together,” he said. »

- When Bailey was inducted into the group
during the early 1970s, the Druids upheld
leadership and scholarship as essentialval- p
ues for members. He recalled their meetings
at Gustine’s Restaurant —- now Hemingway’s
Cafe —— on Forbes Avenue, whenvthe mem-
bers, each with their ‘own campus niche,‘,,
would gather to support one anotheris ini-
tiatives. , ‘

Bailey said that during his time as SGB
president, he realized the need to revise the
SGB constitution to.have more oversight
of its ﬁnancial procedures. He said that he
and other members of the Druids openly
worked apart from non-Druid SGB members
to rewrite the constitution in order to ward ~
off potential problems. T

Howard received his'induction into the

. Druids in 1971 while he served on the Cam-‘

pus Judicial Board. During his time in the
group, members were “tapped” into the
organization based on their leadership po-
tential within their respective organizations.

“A member came and spoke to me,” How-
ard said in email, referring to _his tapping.
“He happened to be an RA in my Towers
dorm.” ' p ' ‘

H'oward’s induction also took place at
Gustine’s. Although he remembers the el-
ements of the ceremony, he opted not to_
elaborate on the details. T p_ _

. ~ While the Druids maintained rituals and

often worked in private among themselves, . S

Bailey said the organization was never “any
sort of Skull and Bones type of group,” refer-

_ ring to the renowned undergraduate secret

society at Yale University. But Howard noted 1
that the group still incorporated justiﬁed
and valuable’ elements of secrecy.

“Rituals are important in each of our lives

.. as individuals and as a society ’,’ Howard said.

“When we promise that the rituals remain
within the conﬁnes of the walls of the cer-'
emony, they should stay thatway. I believed
that 40 years ago, and I believe that now.” ,

The shift toward anonymous activity
_' It is unclear when the Druids ofﬁcially

. went underground. According to Dave Gau, V
a former Druid and current Ph.D. student at A ,_

Pitt, the group became secret in 1996.
According to a 2005 article in The Pitt
News, the Druids became a secret society '

in 2000 when they refused to complywith . A

the Student Organization Resource Center’s
requirement to provide a list of members -
and oﬂicers of the student group. As a result,
the Druids were no longer eligible for SORC ‘

assistance, including allocations and ofﬁce '’

space provided by the University. .

'_ . Shortly thereafter, the invitation—only
Druids tookhon-a muchmore private pres-‘
ence. And as the secrecy surrounding the

ulation and intrigue, media organizations on
campus took an active role in documenting
the society and its members whenever they
reappeared.

In 2002, members of the Druids marched
around campus wearing black, hooded
cloaks — one person carrying a large sword.

Shannon McLaughlin, the editor—in—chief
of The Pitt News from 2oo2 to 2003, recalled
how the members were cloaked in black
robes, some with sneakers poking out of
the bottom. '

In 2004, then—freshman Alex Capece
found a letter in his Litchﬁeld Towers mail-
box with a $175 gift certiﬁcate to The Book
Center. The certiﬁcate was signed: Druids,
Delta Chapter. That same year, then—soph-
omore Jennifer Anukem found the same
letter in her mailbox, which helped her make
sense of an odd message on her answering

machine. " ‘

“You have just received the Druids’ Ca-
thedral Fountain Scholarship. Congratula-
tions!” a mysterious voice said.

Both of the students were actively in-

volved on Pitt’s campus, with Anukem serv— '

ing_as vice chairwoman of political action for
Black Action Society, president of Collegiate
YMCA and Freshman Affairs chairwoman for
SGB, among other positions. Capece worked
at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, volunteered
at Student Health Services teaching CPR
and was an associate. member of the Delta
Chi fraternity. '
Anukem told The Pitt News then that
she didn’t know much about the Druids,

but didn’t think it was “a bad group at all.” .

After the 2002 Druid march, Dave Hart-
man, who worked as Pitt News editor—in-
chief from 2003 to 2004, and his staff spent

 

meeting. Bobby Mizia | Assistant Visual Editor

I three hours camped out in the Cathedral

because there was rumored to be a Druid
event taking place, but no more cloaked in-
dividuals ever appeared. Additional rumors
buzzed around campus that the Druids spent
quality time with the chancellor, but these
tales were never conﬁrmed.

5‘Speculation can make it grow into some-
thing very bigger than it really is,” Hartman
said. .

The Druids, also experienced a moment
in the spotlight in _the late 2000s when Pitt
Brieﬂy, a student news website, ran aproﬁle
on the group. 1

“That was a time when you always met in
the same place,” said Gau, a member of the
Druids at the time, referring to how the or-

‘ ganization began rotating its meeting places

after the Pitt'Brieﬂy story appeared.

In the comingmonths, Gau said, the
group dropped from 24 to 10 members as
the Druids cleansed those suspected of leak-
ing information to Pitt Brieﬂy.

“We were supposed to be underground

‘ before that, but then we became more un-

derground,” Gau said.

The debate over the value of secrecy

In their public years, the Druids were
composed of campus leaders who aimed
to create a cohesive dialogue among them-
selves and promote leadership on campus.

. But as they’ve retreated into anonymity,

their character and purpose, too, seem to
have become obscure°d.
McLaughlin compared the secrecy of the

order to the “old boy’s club” nature of the ‘
. ‘U.S. federal government: She lamented that

such secrecy contributes to the‘ image that
politics and student organizations are “kind
of an exclusive thing,” rather than receptive
of all members.

“In retrospect, I don’t know if it was sup-
posed to be a ‘Haha, in your face. You don’t

 ongend shes recaped their first semester on the Board atllast .nigh’s _

know who we are.’ or an actual formality,”
she said. _ ' . ‘
McLaughlin noted that general belief
held, that the organization was designed
to bolster the members’ professional lives
through networking and job opportunities,

‘ but her staff could never nail down whether
. the Druids had a philanthropy component

or not. .

“It’s probably with everyone’s best inter-
est to have some transparency,” she said.
“It’s hard to know who it’s beneﬁting.”

Her successor, Hartman, was far more
cynical toward the group. He said that he
was “aggressively and openly opposed to
them,” sincesuch a covert society was the
natural enemy of a newspaper.

_Greg Heller—LaBelle, who served as edi-
tor—in—chief of The Pitt News from 2003 to
2.005, presented an entirely different per-
spective on the group. While he remained in
the dark about the functionality of the group
like previous editors, Heller—LaBelle took a
positive approach to dealing with the society.

He noted that a fairly accepted piece of
“Druid lore” was the guaranteed spot for cer-
tain campus leaders in the group, including
the SGB president and editor—in—chief of The
Pitt, News. But according to Heller-LaBelle,
neither he nor the 2005 SGB president, Brian
Kelly, were members. ’

During Heller-LaBelle’s time at Pitt, the
Druids were not the sole secret society roam-
ing campus. Heller- LaBelle recalled a battle
between two obscure ‘organizations during
his time ‘at Pitt as the Druid’s “humorous

, schism with The ’Order of 875.” Kelly had

created his own group known as The Order
of the 87 to rival the Druids.

As a leader of the campus newspaper,
Heller—LaBelle said he empathized with
these secret groups and chose not to pry in
an attempt to unveil their purposes. He be-
lievedthat groups such as the Druids and The

cast their votes for six allied members

ber Board. In his original changes, Gish

’ expressed thata system that promoted

more diversity on the Board would make
for a better student government, and he
called for an elimination of the megaslate
system.

Gish met resistance from the Board
during hislinitial attempts at revisions.
After several weeks of contention between
Gish and Board members over the revi-
sions proposal, the Elections chairman
decided to persist with the changes, saying

he refused to compromise. His redevel— ‘

oped proposal introduced the removal of
the slate system. ‘ - , V

Gish presented his third version of
the proposal to revise the code during
the meeting. He presented his first pro-
posal during a meeting with the Board in
early March and his second during an-
other meeting with the Board on March

discussion or level-of" openness that you
canonly have if it’s not in public,” he said.

Continued evolution - .
, Although both members of the society
and non—members alike agree that there can
be beneﬁts to secrecy, the Druids’ political
involvement on campus has recently become
a divisive issue. ~
The infraction complaint ﬁled by. SGB
Elections Chair Aaron Gish against Board
President Gordon Louderback on March 31
brought the presence of the society’s mem-

bers on the Board back into the public light. .

While members of student governmenthave
been involved in the secret society since its
earliest years, their relatively recent shift to
complete anonymity adds a new dimension-
to their roles as elected officials.

Amidst all the murkiness and rumor that
has swirled around the Druids throughout
the decades, the group’s continued emphasis

on campus leadership has remained clear. .7

But the unproclaimed nature of the group’s

purpose and activities in recent years seems -
. to present a distinct contrast from the well-

established mission of the society in its ear-
lier years. '
“I haveserved in leadership roles in

many areas of my life  not for personal ‘

gain, but with a servant’s attitude,” Howard
said. “That was what was the essence of the
Druids.” I _ ,

the topic during the last public meeting of
the spring semester, which will take place
next Tuesday, April 16.

In addition to eliminating the slate sys-
tem entirely, Gish suggested the following
revisions to the rules involving endorse-
ments. '

According to revised section 208.02,
a candidate will be able to seek endorse-
ments from any Student Life—afﬁliated or—
ganization but not receive endorsements
from academic departments. Furthermore,
according to revised section 207.03, mem-
bers of student government who receive
stipends as a result of their afﬁliation with
the student government, such as commit-
tee chairpersons and Allocations Commit-
tee members, will not be able to endorse
candidates.

Gish also proposed changes to rules
governing other aspects of the campaign
process. V 1 ‘ 7

According to revised section 201.07, “A
campaign manager is a non-candidate who
serves as a representative of a candidate.”

Candidates may have only one campaign
manager, and he or she must be declared
in the SGB Petition and Application Packet
at the beginning of the election.

Gish also provided a deﬁnition for “so-
cial media” as it relates to the campaign.
He said that in the past, candidates were

confused about what constituted social ..

media. In revised section 201.08, Gish de-
ﬁnes social media as any online resource
a candidate uses during the course of the
campaign period. ’
Thoughthe Board voted to table the de-
cision regarding the proposed changes to

ber to dissent from the motion, because he
felt the changes to the code deserved more

Deposit insurance makes banking
system less responsible and stable

Christy Lampe
For The Pitt News

‘’ Recently, another bank failure was

announced on the tiny island of '
Cyprus. Banks in Cyprus are now
insolvent due to money the island
loaned to Greece. Accordingly,
Cyprus will now require a govern-
ment bailout from the European
Central Bank. However, because
of this bailout, depositors in Cy-
prus banks will lose money. In
other bank bailouts, depositors

. have remained fairly insulated.

But this insulation is causing
problems in the United States
— government-insured depos-
its are exactly why banks are so
reckless. Depositors knowtheir
funds are insured and that they
can recover their money regard-
less of how irresponsibly banks
behave. Banks then use this free,
government-backed insurance
to counterbalance ﬁnancial risks
associated with crazy ﬁnancial
schemes —- including people who
purchase a $500,000 home on a
$55,000 salary without a deposit.

The Federal Deposit Insur-
ance Corporation is the American

banking system’s longest-running
bailout program. The FDIC will
insure the ﬁrst $250,000 of sav-

” ings at any bank along with an

unlimited amount of money in
your checking account.‘ So if your
bank goes under, the FDIC will
cover any amount of money the
bank cannot afford to reimburse
its customers.

The evolution of the FDIC is
noteworthy. When it ﬁrst began
to insure deposits in 1934, only
a customer’s ﬁrst‘$2,500 were
insured. ‘Adjusting for inflation,
that is equivalent to $40,000 in
2010. At that time, the govern-
ment assumed that if you were
putting more than that into a
bank, you were intelligent enough
to choose a responsible place to
put your money. The FDIC began
to expand its insurance amount
each year. In 2008, duringthe
economic recession, the FDIC-in-
sured amount became $100,000
and now has reached $250,000.
So the original goal of the FDIC
went from protecting the aver-
age depositor from poverty to
ensuring that depositors never
need to worry about their banks’
behavior.’

But the real reason we have de-
posit insurance is not to protect
the depositors, it’s to protect the
banks. Banks keep a very small
percentage of their money on
hand, so if a signiﬁcant number of
depositors withdraw funds at the
same time, the banks would not be
able to provide all of the funds to
its customers simultaneously. One
reason people no longer hide their
money under their mattresses is
because of the tremendous con-
ﬁdence in the American banking
system, in addition to the govern-
ment-backed insurance deposit
program. Cyprus had deposit in-
surance, too, but their depositors
are still losing money.

Alternatively, the European
Central Bank may have chosen to
not take money from the deposi-
tors’ accounts and to honor the
full amount of insurance money.
But this would require printing
more euros, which could cause
hyperinﬂation. Even though the
depositors would have the same
amount of money after the bailout
as they did before, the purchasing
power of each bank note would

for the economy, since both bank deposi-
tors, as well as the “non—saving” public,
would be hurt with a devalued currency.

of 1929 through the beginning of 1933,
consumer prices declined by 24.4 percent.

The FDIC promotes risky behavior for
banks: The banks enjoy the coverage, while
American people pay the premiums. Con-
sider a world without deposit insurance,

search on their new plasma TVs than where
they will deposit their life savings. Today,
bankers realize that customers focus on
free services and not how much risk they
take. Accordingly, there is little incentive
for depositors to make wise investments.

However, without government insurance, .

This is likely the action the United States
would take when this inevitably happens
to our banking system. Essentially, the de-

Additionally, we need to remove the

are a creation of capitalism, but in fact,
they are the result of a big government.
Regulations act as a barrier to entry,
adding to the cost of overhead. This blocks

new entrants to the market, allowing big _

The Pitt baseball team rebounded from
arguably its most arduous weekend of the

..season with an emphatic 24-7 road vic-

tory over the Youngstown State Penguins
rat Eastwood Field on Tuesday.
After losing three straight games
against South Florida University, the
Panthers (21—9, 3-3 Big East) responded

Junior outﬁelder Casey Roche led the
charge at the plate, going 5-for-7 in a his-
toric hitting day with 10 RBIs and com-
pleting the elusive “cycle” of a single,
double, triple and home run’.

The Panthers didn’t start the game as

TAssER’s TAKE

4 Staff Wrz'ter

P Pitt News sports colum_nistDonnie Tasserwas

a redshirt senior member of the Pittwrestling
team this season. After 34 years as the coach
of the w_restling team, Rande Stottlemyer
recently decided to retire, so Tasser and cur-
rent and formerPittwrestlers reﬂected on the
impact Stottlemyer had on them.

His statistics are impressive: 34 years at
the helm, 304 wins (the most-in school his-
tory), 56 individual Eastern Wrestling League
champions, 33 All-Americans, three national

t Pitt wrestlers salute retirin

champions and three straight EWL team titles

, to cap off his coaching career.

But not even those illustrious numbers do’
justice to Rande Stottlemyer, who announced
Monday that he is retiring as head coach of
the University of Pittsburgh wrestling team.
The positive impact “Stotty” —— as we liked to
call him — had on so many of his wrestler’s
lives cannot be measured in simple statistics.

“It’s kind of funny to think about, but I’m
glad to say I was the very last guy at the very
last weight to wrestle under him at the na-
tional tournament,” senior heavyweight and
NCAA All-American Zac Thomusseit said.
“And I wouldn’t be here in this great position

right now if it wasn’t for him and the things
he has offered me. I accomplished one of my
lifetime goals of being an All-American with
him in my corner as my coach. '1 can’t thank
him enough for always being there for me.”
Because of his lengthy 34-year tenure,
Coach Stottlemyer had a rare opportunity

' to coach two generations of wrestlers within

the same family. Jeff Wilps was included in
Stottlemyer’s ﬁrst recruiting class and his
son, two-time All-American Matt Wilps, was
one of Coach Stottlemyer’s ﬁnal three seniors.

“I’m glad I was able to-be a part of Coach
Stotty’s last senior class,”_Matt Wilps said.
“It’s crazy to think that my dad was here for

g Coach Stottlemyer

his ﬁrst year and my brother [Tyler Wilps] and
I were here for his ﬁnal year. He has taught
me to value hard work and strong character
through his commitment to the program.

Stotty has had a big impact on me. He has had )3

.a big impact on everybody, and I’m happy we
could win the EWL for him in his ﬁnal year
as coach.” '

Coach Stotty’s~impact on his wrestlers has

- not changed over the years.
“Rande was the reason I went to Pitt,” said

Pat Santoro, a two-time national champion 

for Pitt in 1988 and 1989. “Many people don’t

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Louisville deserving national champions after epic ﬁnal

Mark Bradley
Atlanta J0ur7zaI—C07zs1f_z'2fulz'07z (M C T)

ATLANTA — It was all anyone could want
from a championship game, and it came at
a time when the sport needed it. A season
pockmarked by low scores and defensive
excess saved the absolute best for last —
an NCAA men’s basketball ﬁnal of great
playing, great coaching and, wonder of
wonders, great offense.

As if that weren’t enough, it also pro-

duced a great champion. The Louisville
Cardinals took everything Michigan had
to offer — and the Wolverines, at least on
offense, have a lot — and hit back harder,

winning 82-76. Louisville entered this Big 6

Dance as the team to beat, and it exited as
the team that couldn’t belbeaten.

“The toughest young men I’ve ever
coached,” Rick Pitino said afterward, and
after seeing the Cardinals override 12-point
leads in consecutive Final Four games and
overcome the loss of third guard Kevin Ware
to a broken leg, nobody rose to object. ,

Nobody else in the land could have beat-
en Michigan this starry night. Nobody else
could have stayed close. The Wolverines
made 52.1 percent of their shots, and in the
world of contemporary college basketball
that’s shoot—out—the—lights stuff. Louisville
saw its vaunted defense pierced from with-
out and within, and still it won.

The ﬁrst half was one of the wildest in
the history of title games. The Wolverines
played Louisville off its ﬂeet feet, chasing
the Cardinals out of their zone and then
spreading the court so expertly that the
nation’s best defensive team couldn’t stop
anything —— not Spike Albrecht from behind
the 3-point line or Spike Albrecht driving to
the hoop, and about here you were saying:
Spike Albrecht?

Yes, Spike Albrecht. His given name

is Michael, and he’s a freshman sub from

‘ Crown Point, Ind. He backs up Trey Burke,

the national player of the year. Before Mon-
day night, Albrecht’s collegiate zenith had
been the seven points he scored in the South
_Regional ﬁnal against Florida. He had six —
on two game-altering 3-pointers — over the

Syracuse zone in the ﬁrst half of Saturday’s
semiﬁnal, but that was nothing compared
to this. .
Albrecht scored 17 points in 16 ﬁrst-half
minutes on’ the sport’s biggest stage, and
his driving basket 3:56 before the break
put Michigan ahead 33-21. At that moment,

Bditotldlollclel

Albrecht had nearly outscored the NCAA’s
No. 1 overall seed by himself,’ and newly
minted Hall of Famer Pitino called a ﬂum-
moxed timeout, surely to ask his Cardinals:
“Really? We get Trey Burke out of the game
and we’re getting beat by Spike Albrecht?”

You’ll recall, however, that these same

Cardinals trailed Wichita State by 12 points
Saturday, and they managed to concoct
another massive comeback in even shorter
order. Luke Hancock, the backup forward
who’d undone the Shockers, hit four treys in
the span of four possessions to bring Louis-
ville within a point, and Montrezl Harrell’s
fast—break dunk off an Albrecht turnover —
Spike is human! —— put the Cardinals ahead.

Free throws by Glenn Robinson III gave
the Wolverines a 38-37 halftime lead that,
given their ﬂying start, seemed almost like a
deﬁcit. But the intriguing part about a game
separated by one point was that marked the
precise margin by which one reserve (A1-
brecht) had outscored another (Hancock).

It seemed inevitable that Louisville
would pull ahead in the second half, and
the Cardinals did. Michigan kept answer-
ing, and the back—and-forth nature of this
frantic game made you wish it could end in
a tie. John Beilein, the Wolverines’ clever
coach, would think of something and his
players would execute it, and then Pitino
and the ’Ville would counter.

But such is the force of Louisville’s tal-
ent and will that the Cardinals ﬁnally built

. a working lead oftheir own. A Peyton Siva

alley—oop off Hancock’s feed made it 67- 62,

and two inside rolls by Gorgui Dieng gave.

Louisville an eight—point lead. And then
came another 3—po_inter from Hancock,
this from the corner after a Russ Smith
pass, to make it 76-66 with three minutes
left. (Hancock would ﬁnish with 22 points
and become the ﬁrst sub ever named Final
Four MVP.) .
St_ill, this was the Michigan that had
spotted Kansas a 14-pointlead in the Round
of 16 and won in overtime. Burke" kept driv-
ing and -scoring. (He would ﬁnish with 24
points.) Inside the ﬁnal 30 seconds, Michi-
gan was within four. But the Cardinals held
their nerve and made their free throws and
delivered Title No. 2 to their Hall of Fame
coach, andnobody could say justice hadn’t
been served.
' Nor could anyone say the sport wasn’t
better for these 4o_ golden minutes on a
Monday night in April. This was the right

. game at the right time, the right game and

the right winner. I

know this, but I was about to sign with Penn
State when I went on.a late weekend visit to
Pitt. After spending some time with Rande,
I realized he was who I wanted to wrestle
for. And I learned so much from him — life
lessons, how you treat people, dealing with
adversity. Rande is a very special person, and
I’m thankful to have gotten the chance to not

Many of Coach Stottlemyer’s former
wrestlers have found success in collegiate

champion Keith Gavin has also coached at
Lehigh, as well as at his alma mater, Pitt. Ryan
Tomei has spent time at Northern Illinois and
North Carolina, and former All-American
Matt Kocher is currently an assistant coach
with the Panthers.

And that is only a partial list.

“When you see how passionate he is for
coaching, it rubs off on you,” Santorosaid of
Stottlemyer. “It doesn’t- surprise me at all how
many of his wrestlers have become coaches
themselves. And if they learned anything
from Rande, anything at all, they will make
a great coach.” A I

“Stotty put mein contact with my current

job,” said Victor Konno, a member of the
team from 2008-2012. “The man literally

knows everybody,and everybody loves him.-

Coach Stottlemyer is always willing to help,
no matter wha .” V

I remember going to a donor luncheon
hosted by Chancellor Mark N ordenberg with
Coach Stottlemyer prior to a football game
last fall. Coach shook hands with just about
everybody present, and I lost count of how
many people told me I was lucky to have him
as a coach. . I

And trust me, I consider myself unbeliev-
ably lucky for being able to wrestle for such

an extraordinary coach and person.

Coach Stotty impacted so many of his
wrestlers’ lives by doing the little things. He
constantly looks at the glass as half-ﬁill. Every
time I had a bad practice or had to lose a lot
of weight, Coach Stotty was there with posi-
tive reinforcement. Even on my worst day,
I couldn’t help leaving a conversation with
Coach Stottlemyer in a much better mood.

He simply has that effect on people.

Stottlemyer’s retirement from coaching
does not signal the end of his tenure at Pitt,
however.

’ Pitt announced that he will stay on with
the athletic department in the position of
Senior Advisor for Olympic Sports, assisting

ued in the eighth as Vranka doubled again
to score Soto and make the score 13-3.
After Hess walked, Roche delivered the
highlight of the game with a grand slam
over the left—field wall.

Entering the ninth inning with a 17-3
lead, Pitt tacked on seven more runs for
good measure. The Panthers scored on a
sac-fly with the bases loaded from senior
Ronald Sucre, an RBI hit-by-pitch from
Hess, a two-run double by Roche, an RBI
double from pinch—hitting senior John
Peluso, a sac-ﬂy off the bat of freshman
Bennette Hill and an RBI single from Soto.

Youngstown State responded with four
runs in the bottom of the ninth to avoid
a 21-run defeat. - —

Overall, Pitt’s offense produced 24
runs on 24 hits after the bats struggled
against USF. '

Besides Roche’s, other impressive of-
fensive performances included a 4-for-6,
three-RBI day for Vranka and a 4-for-5
hitting performance by Wolsonovich, who
scored four runs. Hess also crossed the
plate four times and recorded three RBIs.

On the mound, senior starting pitcher
Jeff Kelly lasted only 4 2/3 innings, al-
lowing three runs on six hits. Out of the
bullpen, redshirt sophomore Luke Curtis,
redshirt freshman Pete Macke and red-
shirt sophomore Joe Harvey combined
to works 1/3 shutout innings.

But the back end of the bullpen ran
into trouble, just as it did against USF.
Sophomore Dave Yakopec allowed two
Penguins runs to score injust one—third
of an inning pitched, and redshirtjunior
Jonathan Danielczyk pitched the final
two-thirds of the ninth but allowed two
more runs.

With the three—game losing streak
squelched by some high-octane hitting,
Pitt’s next challenge comes in the form
of another quality Big East opponent,
NotrelDame, in a weekend series at Cost
Field in the Petersen Sports Complex.
