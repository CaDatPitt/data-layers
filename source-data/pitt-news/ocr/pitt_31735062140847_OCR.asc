A  Conference
   Tries To Solve
 Frat Problems

Special war committee of the
National Interfraternity Confer-
_ ence headed by Cecil J. Wilkinson

— of Washington, executive secretary

of Phi Gamma Delta, is develop-

, ing ways and means to insure the

continuance of fraternities so long

as any men are available for un-
dergraduate membership.

The Navy has announced, and

V the Army indicated, that enlisted

1 men who are sent to colleges for

specialized training may join fra-
ternities.
‘From these soldiers and sail-
‘ors, from men who have not yet
, reached draft age, and from the
physically disabled, the college
fraternities expect to ﬁnd suﬁii-
cient members to carry on their
chapters. They expect also to
draw members from the ranks of
pre-medical, engineering, and
pre-dental students.

Men’s Council to Submit
Request For Reduced Fare

A committee to obtain reduced streetcar fares reported
at Men’s Council last Wednesday. Chairman Art Thompson,
C43, announced that the streetcar ofﬁcials have been ap-

proached.

Chinese Exhibit
Opens At Pitt

Yesterday the exhibit of Chinese
Ceramics opened on the seventh
ﬂoor of the Cathedral. The exhibit
room is ﬁlled with objects of Chi-
nese Art that have survived .down
through the centuries. There are
bronze statuettes, various forms of
bowls, and intricate designs on
wall scrolls. Examples of the Chi-

‘ nese art to be found in the exhibit

show the transition from crude
Chinese pottery down through the
discovery of the beauty of’ the
elongated ﬁgures and the use of
glazes to bring out the true cul-
ture of the Chinese people.

i1\iDebor, Pitt Man, Receives

 Decorations For Heroism

LIEUTENANT L. De8OR
Pitt hero

Another Pitt man has made
good. Lieutenant Lawrence Debor,
who was a senior at the University
in 1941, has received the Oak Leaf
Cluster for heroism in the South-
West Pacic.

This citation of heroism was

_ made on March 17, just two years

to the day that he entered the
Army Air Corps. General Harman
presented the award somewhere in
the /Southwest Paciﬁc to the Elev-
enth Bomb Group for its effective
work. Lt. Debor has been with the
Eleventh Bomb group four months.

Lt. Debor left Pitt three
months before his graduation to
join the Army. While here he
studied biology and was a mem-

' ber of the ROTC. After class he

worked outside of school and
therefore took no part in activi-
ties.

 By LES GILBERT

Dr. Stephen Wilson, assistant
professor in the .school of phar-
macy, is eonducting a major cam-
paign for the collection of all avail-
able quinine in the district.

After the Japs had invaded the
major quinine producing territories
of the world, Allied military lead-
ers became troubled over an im-
pending shortage of this vital rem-
edy for malarial fever. This worry
was quickly dispelled, however,

‘ twhen ample stores of quinine were

discovered lying dormant on many
drugstore shelves throughout the
country.

In an attempt to ameliorate con-
ditions, a nation-wide drive to col-
lect these supplies was launched.
Pharmacists. were asked by the

’ government to donate the valuable

drug to allay the suffering of Al-
lied ﬁghting men in zones where

C imalaria is prevalent. This territory

 is practically immune from ma-

laria, and therefore a heavy supply

1:7 of quinine had been lying idle on

district drug-store shelves.

Dr. Wilson and his committee
composed of Harry Watkins, '43 ;
Leonard Edelson, '43; Lownun
Gandet, '44; Robert Black, '44;

Andy Gusto,

  

ert Louis Stevens, '45, have cov-
ered a territory from Youngs-
town to Altoona in search of the
needed medicine. So far, the

drive has netted a total of 120

containers of various weights.

National campaign total has

reached over 40,000» packages
with supplies still coming in
from the different local commit-
tees. The packages are boxed
and shipped to the American
Pharmaceutical Association at
2215 Constitution Avenue in
Washington, D. C. Thousands of
druggists have already sent in
their quinine stock and have re- .
ceived government certiﬁcates in
recognition of their donations.
Four classes in the school of
pharmacy have been organized
to investigate the quantity of
quinine in this immediate terri-
tory and have succeeded in stim-
ulating the interest of Pharma-
cists in this national drive.

The highest amount collected in
this district so far was brought in
by Marvin Sneiderman, '44.

“This drive has only begun to
get under way. There is an enor-
mous amount of quinine in the
area, and it is our patriotic duty to
ship it to our ﬁghting~me‘n.-” stat-

   

Requests to the streetcar officials
are as follows: There should be a
ﬁve _ cent round trip fare from
the Shadyside builiing to the Cath-
edral; this fare should be available
to both engineering students and
students going to the railroad sta-
tion near Shadyside; there should
be a roundtrip fare of ﬁve cents
from Shadyside to Trees Gym.

Centre Avenue cars would be
employed for’ the latter, while
streetcar 75 or any other Fifth
Avenue car would be available
under the former proposal. It
was pointed out at the meeting
that anything above the cost of
printing tickets would be pure
proﬁt for the railway company
since students are not using cars
in traveling to and from Shady-‘
side at present.

The railway companies are now
considering the matter. No decision
has been reached at the present
time.

Also at the meeting Creighton
McClintock, C43, was appointed to
act with ESGC in their investiga-
tion of the Tuck Shop. Cal Levin-
son, BA44, was appointed to work
with ESGC on a social committee
to plan future social affairs for
cadets.

Army, Navy Give

Screening’ Test

Last Friday the Army and Navy
gave a qualiﬁcation test to all high
school and college students who
faced inductions into the armed
services. Object of the test was to
obtain a list of persons who would
meet the qualifications for officer
training. The test was given by
Dr. William R. Grove, assistant
professor of Psychology, and was
for both Army and Navy officer
candidates. '

Testing took place at Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial with three
hundred twenty-seven University
students participating. In order
to qualify for further college
training, a sulliciently high score
must be attained on the test,
the minimum being one hundred
ten points.

“Approximately eighty per cent
of the students here at Pitt who
took the test should attain the
minimum score,” stated Dr. Grove.
The test will not be the prime fac-
tor in choosing the candidates.
Ability to learn, appearance, and
other personal characteristics will
also be considered. Candidates who
have been potentially nominated
for further training will be notiﬁed
before the end of the prescribed
period, ending June 1.

A personal interview will fol-
low. If the candidate is approv-
ed after the ﬁrst interview, a
second, eliminatory, interview
will be held. After passing the
second interview successfully the
actual college training will pro-
ceed.

Further developments will be an-
nounced in the News. ' .

Freshman men who maintain a minimum quality poinl
average of 2.5 are eligible to be tapped for Phi Eta Sigma,
national scholastic honorary fraternity for freshman men.
Initiations are held at the end of both the first and second
semesters of the freshman year and membership is open to
freshman men in all schools of the University. Students who,
besides entering into the activities of the University, have
achieved a ‘good scholastic average during their ﬁrst year

in 1923. Since that date, the fraternity has grown to a na- '

tional organization of forty—three chapters and is now a mem-

Opinion Survey

Pitt Students

“The American Opinion Poll,"
which gives the students of the na-
tion an opportunity to participate
in a nation-wide opinion survey on
questions concerning post-war con-
ditions, has been opened to Uni-
versity students through the

 ,iLet's’Cooperate .  .

Just as there is always a day in spring when every tree

. has a couple sitting beneath it, so each spring ﬁnds a heart

and arrow drawn on a chair in one of the Nationality‘ hooms.

This year more than ever, because the second and third
ﬂoor classrooms are no longer available for use to the student
body, the Nationality Classrooms are being overworked.
Since the wear on these rooms is much greater than it has
ever been in the past, as a patriotic gesture, students are

asked to help cooperate in the maintenance and order of
them. .

At present, too, the janitors are overworked and they
are no longer able to clean the rooms during lunch hour
(when there are classes in them) or after classes are over.
Then, too, because we have no Spring Recess this year, the
nationality rooms cannot have their usual “spring house-
cleaning.” ~

It is a simple matter for the students to cooperate
with the Buildings and Grounds Department who are at
present pushed to capacity. Students can refrain from put-
ting their feet on the chairs. They can use the window pole
to open the windows instead of jumping, on radiators. Most
of the poles are discreetly hidden, but they can be found.

This is an appeal to all Pitt students! Nationality Rooms
should mean much to them and this is really an appeal to
take care‘ of their own property. Maybe some ambitious stu-
dents could organize some way to seethat these rooms are
-kept clean.—D.E.R.

MESS: Food, with an inferiority

side the University of Pitt. Usually
followed by a roll call to tabulate
results.

GUARD DUTY: The physical
guarding of buildings, soldiers, and
sundry Federal chattels from vari-
ous, varying cosmopolitan evils. As
every citizen knows, -guard duty is
a privilege reserved for . fellows
with dates on Saturdays and Sun-
days. _

CADET: This is what the 1,000
men here were referred to as one
day. Rumors have it that it hap-
pcned between 1:15 and 1:17 on a
Tuesday afternoon.

ZERO HOUR: The strained,
emotional moment when a cadet
climaxeshis brooding with the de-

cision to ask for a second helping H

of Salisbury Steak.

GIG: Sorry, but gigs don’t exist
at the Cathedral——so naturally, no
one here knows the meaning of
such a foreign term.

ing of sleep; generally believed to

counteract the building-up effect of —
calisthenics. A howling success— A

especially in the mornings.

H J. {When the Army moved into Pitt
there were a lot of changes made,
" hot the least of which was the one
i that transformed the faculty into
p officers and presented them with
- the unique, sensation of having
‘prompt, obedient students who did
everything they were told and ad-
‘ ‘dressed their instructors with a
respectful “sir.”

This change was probably felt
‘ most in the ‘ athletic. depa.rtment
where the army drafted all the
coaches and physical education in-
structors without so much as the
customary formal greeting from
the president or the. possibility of
a. draft board appeal. Instructors
Carver, Mitterling, Hartwig, Hoel,
'4Kliskey, and Cy Morgan were told
to wear a pair of Khaki trousers,
consider themselves as oﬂicers, and
start 0}’; a conditioning program
_ for the cadets.

A LS0 they started conditioning ca-
. ‘dots. The conditioning program
‘V .went‘along all right as far as the
. cadets were concerned, but the in-
structors had a hard time.
‘ . -There was, for ‘instance, the day
that‘ Nick Kliskey put the boys
through their paces. He got
through the exercises and was
' quite proud of the way he had han-
dled the commands. Then he dis-

 .4'/ac /Jwvwu

missed the cadets. Only no one
moved. The temperature was near
zero, and Mr. Kliskey had i" forgot-
ten to give the command for them
to retrieve their overcoats which
were folded in neat piles on the
floor.

Then there was also the
Frank Carver was giving out the
orders. It was pretty cold, and Car-
ver put his hands in his pockets——
but not for long. In a few mo-
ments there was an officer at his
side coldly (no pun intended) in-
forming him that his job was to
set a.n. example for the cadets, and
the cadets were not permitted to
have their hands in their pockets.

At present the cadets are being
drilled at the indoor track house,
the Stadium, Trees ﬁeld, Trees
gym, and the Cathedral gym. The
instructors reported that the ﬁrst
batch of cadets were pretty slug-
gish at first, but that the new
group snapped into things right
away. '

It is expected that Nick Kliskey
will soon take over as head of the
Army-training program, relieving
athletic publicity director-Intra-
mural director-competitive athletic
instructor Frank Carver. Kliskey
has been down at Maxwell ‘Field in
Alabama for a ten-day course in
Army training.

asts among the prisoners, the Pitt
shipment should go over big, for
over a dozen rackets were turned
in and approximately six dozen
balls. Baseball was not neglected
either. One boy brought in six bats
and there were all kinds of’ gloves
and mits and balls.

Apparently the Pitt students
were even willing to make sacri-
ﬁces. One ball was turned in that
bore the autographs of Paul and
Lloyd Waner. Another carried the
signature of Beans Reardon, the
national league umpire, with the
sad date, 1938.

There were six pairs of boxing
gloves, 2. golf set complete with
bag‘.
skates turned in. One fraternity
contributed a brand new football.
And if the prisoners ever decide to
get rough with their captors the
hockey sticks someone turned in
ought to come in handy as will the
six pairs of boxing gloves that
were given.

In addition to the‘ equipment al-
ready mentioned, there were soft-
balls, table tennis and badminton
sets, basketballs, mushballs, four-
teen decks of cards, and a game of
ﬁddlesticks turned in.

In all more than 100 pieces of
athletic equipment were received in
addition to a large number of
musical instruments.

Suspension of the freshman rule
has given Coach,” Mitterling at
least ten more candidates for the
diamond team. At present nine
freshmen and one transfer stu-
dent are trying for positions, and
probably many more will attend
practices since installation of the
war time policy.

Foremost. among the fresh is
Frank Novak, a powerhouse hit-
ter hailing from Greensburg High.
Last season, Novak was the lead-
ing batter for Mutual in the Stand-
ard League with an average of
.461 over the 32 game schedule. He
started the year as a catcher but
has since then moved to third base.

Transfer student James “Red”
Reber, muscular right—handed hurl-
er, pitched for Lafayette in the
‘summer of ’42. In the first practice
game this year Reber pitched three
scoreless innings, allowing only
one hit, a double in theright ﬁeld
stands by Eldor Thorsen. His
curve was working effectively, as
he fanned four in the three inning
stretch. *

Another ‘freshman showing prom-
ise thus far is Charlie Heberling,
‘pitcher from Perry High in the
City League. While in high school,
Charlib earned letters on the has-
ketball and football teams. As
Perry had no high school baseball,
Heberling pitched-for an independ-
ent sandlot team. V

Mitterling should develop a good

mound staff, as there is a wealth of ~

hurlers. Other freshman mounds-

men made eligible are John Mc- A
Closkey and John Kelly. Both Mc- '
Closkyyand Kelly pitched an inning .

in the initial game. McClosky was
particularly effective, fanning two

of. the four batters he faced. Kelly —
was hit for two runs on a single, .

walk, error, and wild pitch.

Red Patterson and Jim McCul-

lough, leading ﬁrst basemen, will
be threatened by a brace of fresh-
men. Cyril Plazak, ﬂashy ﬁelder,
Bernard Pawlowski, and Llewellyn
Jordan are trying for the first base
position. Plazak also catches while
Pawlowski plays the outﬁeld.

Others permitted to play by the
new ruling are outﬁelder Ed Citron
and catcher Freddy Bey.

Thus far, letterman Bill McKee
seems to hold the edge on the
pitching staff. He is, however,
closely pressed by Red Reber. Mc-
Closky, Heberling, and Kelly have

pionship, by the way, was annexed
by SAE. However, Director of In-
tramurals Frank Carver has indi-
cated that the spring program will
start up just as soon as he can get

a schedule arranged that will be
suitable to the fraternities.

Many of the boys now have late

afternoon classes, and this means"
that they cannot get up to the
Stadium until 5 o’clock. Several of
the houses have already disbanded
which also complicates the intra-
mural. future. There are at present
only eleven active fraternities on
campus. ~

Armed Services
Receive Foster

0 Song Sheets

By CARL EISENBEI8
Pamphlets, prepared by the stafl’
of the Foster Hall Collection of the
U_niversity and containing the
words to over forty of Stephen
Collins Foster's .most famous
songs, have been distributed by the
thousands to America's armed
forces all over the world.
Our boys in North Africa, Great
-Britain, Iceland, Ireland, Green-
land, Newfoundland, the West In-
dies, South America, Alaska, Ha-
waii, Australia, and New Zealand,
as well as members of the armed

;,. forces stationed at camps in the

U. S., have received the pamphlets
as gifts from Mr. Fletcher Hodges
and his staff at Foster Hall. Mr.
Hodges and his co-workers are -in
charge of the famous Foster Hall
Collection, an almost complete col-

. lection of material relatingto the

life and work of the composer.
Recently, a letter from Lien-
tenant Paul L. Jennings, a for-
mer Pitt man now located with
the armed forces in North
Africa, contained this bit: “Last
evening at song and prayer ser-
vice, the chaplain passed out
copies of the Stephen Foster
Song Book, printed on the Uni-
Versity Press. I immediately
took time out to explain to the
boys that we did something back
at Pittsburgh besides turn out
winning football teams."

One of the most recent requests
for the pamphlets has come from
the Japanese alien resettlement
Villages located in the rnid-west-
ern part of the country.

Over one hundred articles. in-
cluding baseball gloves, baseballs,
boxing gloves, pingpong sets, ice
and hockey skates, tennis rackets,
and musical instruments of all
types, even a zither, have been
turned in. Elaine reports that con-
tributions are still being accepted
in the YMCA office, 3009 Cathe-
dral. “‘Any article that is brought
in to the office will be considered
as part of the drive, and will be
greatly appreciated,” said Elaine.

Many valuable articles includ-
ing keepsakes have been contrib-
uted. The articles that were re-
ceived are already well on their
way toward making some intern-
ed prisoner spend his leisure hours
in a more pleasing manner.

Any type of musical instrument,
athletic. or other form of enter-
tainment equipment will be most
welcome.
