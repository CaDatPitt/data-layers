Pitt’s two food—service contracts
were officially put up for grabs yester-
day afternoon, and there might be a
new cook in the kitchen next year.

Marriott’s five—year contract ends
this summer. At the same time, the con-
tract that put Roy Rogers in the base-
ment of the Cathedral runs out.

The food—service companies com-
peting for these contracts met with
University officials yesterday in a
mandatory meeting at the Pitt’ Club.
That meeting ran all day and included

tours of the facilities on campus for the
potential bidders.

There are two contracts that are up
for bid. The first is the board-plan con-
tract. The company that wins this con-
tract will be the food—service provider
for the cafeterias in the dorms, Eddie’s,
and the Schenley Cafe.

The second contract is the one for
providing an eatery on the ground ﬂoor
of the Cathedral and in Mervis Hall.

While some corporations are bid-
ding for both the contracts, there are
several smaller companies bidding
only for the second contract.

The ”grandcladdy" of student gov’t

Riemer’s college journey leads him to Pitt and the 5GB

  
   
 
 
  

Think about where you were eight
years ago.

Most students would say they were
in middle school, discovering the oppo-
site sex, and struggling to be popular.

Eight years ago, Brian Riemer was
graduating from high school. At 26, he is
the oldest active Student Government
Board member.

“If [Board Member] Marquette
Bowman can be considered ‘the Dad’
around here, I guess that makes me ‘the
Granddaddy,”’ he jokes.

' Granddaddy or not, the junior indus-
trial engineering major doesn’t regret his
decision to come back to college to get a
degree.

But Riemer didn’t always think that
way.

Growing up in Monroeville, he
described himself as the chubby class
clown. When he entered Shadyside
Academy’s Senior School for high
school, he says he thinned out and was
fairly popular.

“I wasn’t involved in a whole lot in
high school,” he said. “But I did get into
trouble.”

  

 

After he graduated from high school
in 1989, he chose to attend Tulane
University in New Orleans. He admits
that he had no idea of what he wanted to
do with his life. Riemer then transferred
after only one semester to Pepperdine
University after he found himself getting
into trouble again. Riemer declined to
elaborate on just what “trouble” meant.

“At that point, money was never an
issue or a worry,” he said. “But that
changed.”

After three semesters at Pepperdine,
his family ran into money problems, and
his parents wanted him to come home
and attend Pitt.

When Riemer came home at the end
of the spring semester, he was offered
what he describes as a “great union job”
at Glenshaw Glass. He was in charge of
inspections and oversaw packing and
shipping. Riemer ended up staying at
Glenshaw for three years.

“Every semester, I kept telling
myself I’d go back to school the next
semester,” he said. “But I couldn’t
decide what to do with my life. One
week I wanted to be a chiropractor, and
the next week it was something else. I
had a new career choice all the time.”

fat-loss pill will be coming soon

Around the World

VALLETA, Malta — PLO Chief Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy met in Malta in a bid to salvage
mideast peace talks. They were joined by a
number of diplomats from other countries.

Both men offered moderate com-
ments —— expressing a desire to resume
negotiations. But there were no private
sessions and it appears they’1l leave the
Mediterranean Island with only promises

V to discuss the crumbling peace effort.

Yesterday’s meeting represents the
hi ghest-level get-together between the two
sides since Israel began a disputed Jewish
construction project last month in East
Jerusalem.

Across t_he' Nation

SAN FRANCISCO — If you’ve ever
wished you could just pop a pill instead of
using that stair-climber, wait a few years
and your wish might come true.

Several drug companies say they’re
having success developing a pill that
speeds up the body’s metabolism and sim-
ulates the effect of exercise.

The pill also breaks down additional
fat and ﬂushes it from the body.
Researchers say the super diet pill could be
on store shelves in the next ﬁve to 10
years.

But chemists wam it won’t let you get
skinny for bathing-suit season in a hurry.

They say it works slowly and works best
along with a healthy diet and regular exer-
cise.

Researchers will be offering some
details today at a meeting of the American
Chemical Society.

NEW YORK —— Philip Morris and RJR
Nabisco aren’t commenting on reports that
they’re trying to settle lawsuits over smok-
ing-related health problems.

The Wall Street Journal says the two
biggest cigarette makers are holding secret
talks with plaintiffs in the case.

According to the Journal, the huge
settlement would clear the industry of lia-
bility for health troubles caused by smok-
ing. In return, the paper says cigarette
makers would establish a multi-billion-
dollar fund. Smokers could seek payments
from the fund, but would then be banned
ﬁom suing cigarette companies for 25
years. Companies would also agree to cut
back on advertising.

The plan reportedly also would
require the companies to submit to regula-
tion by the Food and Drug Administration
and restrict advertising.

WASHINGTON — The government has
launched a “recall roundup” to get unsafe
products out of American homes.
Consumer safety oﬂicials are especially
worried about children’s products, such as
cribs, that have been recalled but may still
be in use.

KenYatta Rogers is not playing
Hamlet anymore. In fact, he’s hoping
to win a theatre competition and take
his career forward.

Rogers is a third—year theatre arts
graduate student at Pitt. If you fol-
low Pitt theatre, you might have seen
him last fall as Hamlet in William
Shakespeare’s classic play, or as,
well, Hamlet, in the production of
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are
Dead.

He’ll be taking part in the
American College Theatre Festival’s
national competition in Washington
D.C. this Sunday. Out of the three
times that Pitt has entered the com-

It was years until Rogers became
seriously interested in theater, but he
still laughs about the reason he
became involved in the craft.

“At first, it was because a girl I
liked was an actress. I followed her
into acting and the acting bug bit me.

“What kept me in acting is I felt
a need to communicate with many
people, not for the star quality. I’m
not interested in a bunch of people

just looking at me. I want to transfer

something to them.”

Rogers’ theatrical experience
ranges from stagework to industry
and training films to commercials.
His one national commercial is for
the United Negro College Fund. He
calls it the “Still 1 Rise” commercial

In a new study measuring per capita faculty research productivity, Pitt was
ranked 25:th in the nation among public research universities and was
defined as a “rising star” among them. The study findings are detailed in
the book, “The Rise of American Research Universities: Elites and
Challengers in the Postwar Era” (John Hopkins University Press, 1996).

Contract causes concerns among union members

veniamin Jackson

 

At the same time that Marriott is
in negotiations with Pitt, it is also
negotiating a contract with Local 29,
one of the unions representing their
workers.

Heydt said this is a yearly event
and is not motivated by the current
contract bidding.

“That’s not connected in any way
[with the current contract bidding],”
Heydt said.

In spite of Heydt’s assertion, the
uncertainity over the future of food
services at Pitt has caused much anx-

 

iety on the part of the rank and file
workers.

Union officials have contact-
ed the SGB, The Pitt News, and
WPTS radio to express their concerns
about the current negotiations.

According to Student
Government Board Member Ryan
Widenmiller, representatives from
Local 29 came to an SGB planning
session and stated their case. The
SGB took no specific action based on
this meeting.

According to union representa-
tives, the criteria that Pitt gave its
bidders in 1997 removed a clause that
would have required whoever won

The new clause only specifies

that the contractor must abide by
University policies and laws concern-
ing substance abuse, safety standards,
human rights, and citizenship
requirements.

“We have a legal responsibility to
recognize Local 29, and we will con-
tinue to negotiate with them,”‘- Heydt
said. He went on to say that Marriott

Because there is nothing in the
University’s criteria requiring the
contractor to keep the union, workers
said they are afraid that long-time
employees, some of whom have been
employed at Pitt for over 30 years,
will either lose their jobs or be forced
to take pay cuts.

Marriott 

The bids must be in by May 15.
Negotiations between Pitt and the var-
ious providers are expected to begin in
early June. The contracts will be
awarded on July 1, with the beginning
of the new fiscal year. Whoever wins
the contracts will take over on August
1.

 

Roger Heydt, Marriott’s general
manager, said Marriott will put in a
bid.

“Marriott does plan on bidding,
and I’m looking forward to being here
in the fall and employing the current
workers,” Heydt said.

Marriott had a five—year contract

that included a renewal option for a
sixth year. Pitt did not choose to renew =

the contract, but Heydt said that’s not
an indication of Marriott’s chances of
winning the current bid;

“I think the University feels there
are advantages to putting the bids out
now,” Heydt said. “If the University
was dissatisfied, they had other ways
of remedying [the problem]. I plan to
be here in the fall.”

Student Government Board mem-

ber Ryan Widenmiller also met with A

University officials yesterday to make
sure student concerns were being
addressed in the bidding process.

Earlier in the
Widenmiller’s Food Services
Committee created a list of student
suggestions for improvements in the
quality of food services.

According to Widenmiller, stu-
dents will not be directly included in
any of these negotiations. Betsy
Salade—Farina, Pitt’s director of food
services, said that student input had
come from the SGB’s suggestion list
and from meetings sponsored by food
services.

Widenmiller said students must
now wait and see what happens.

“We can do absolutely nothing,”
Widenmiller said. “We dissolved the
Food Services Committee after the
proposal was done because there was
no more work.”

Widenmiller said that he is still
keeping in touch with University offi—
cials to keep an eye on how bidding is
going. His concern now is finding
someone to keep track of the bidding
process through the summer.

Riemer 

. Riemer began to think seriously
about a career in engineering when he
was a laborer on the crew to expand the
plant. Even though he was responsible
for the “grunt work,” he really enjoyed
what he was doing.

“I thought it was cool because we
were actually building something,” he
said. “The engineers on the job with
their little white hats could step back and
say, ‘I created that.”’

It wasn’t until he was offered an
apprenticeship at the plant that Riemer
decided to return to college.

“It scared me,” he said. “If I had
accepted, that would be my life.”

Riemer admits that a fear of never
going back to college pushed him to
return. His friends who had attended col-
lege were also graduating, and the more
he thought about it, the more he thought
he should go back.

“It’s kind of funny because when
you’re making good money and all your
friends are broke college kids, you don’t
feel too bad,” he laughs. “But it was
hard, because I thought like the college
kids, and I thought like the guys at the

 

Vmill. It was time to go back.”

Riemer began his second attempt at
a college career in the fall of 1993, tak-
ing two College of General Studies night
school classes. It wasn’t until the fall of
1995 that he was accepted into Pitt’s
School of Engineering and became a
full—time student.

It was when he attended his first
industrial engineering social that he met
former SGB President Andy Wuertele,
who helped to spark his interest in the
organization. ,

“I told him I’d like to get involved
and do some things,” he said. “That’s
what got the ball rolling.’’

He became a member of the
Allocations Committee because of his
concerns about engineering monetary
issues and his curiosity about what SGB
was all about.

After being involved in Allocations
for a year, Riemer says that “the right
people found him” and encouraged him
to run for Board. He says that he felt he
might be able to make more of a differ-
ence if he was a Board member.

“I’m glad the slate found me,” he
says. “Without Brandi Miller, Jennifer
Molluso, David Eisenberg, and Mark
Friedberg, I don’t think that I would
have had the gumption to run alone.”

Riemer is currently the business
manager of SGB and frequently deals
with financial matters‘ and the
Allocations Committee.

“I know what they’re going
through,” he said. “Their job is follow-
ing the book, and they do it very well.
But our job [as the SGB] is to serve the
students, and sometimes the two don’t
mix.”

Riemer also finds it hard to juggle
his work as an industrial engineering

student and his involvement with the
SGB and other groups. He is currently
the president of the Institute of Industrial
Engineering Skills, the new president of
Alpha Pi Mu industrial engineering
honor society, and will be the treasurer
of Tau BetaPi next term. He is also a
member of Phi Sigma Pi, the Mortar
Board Society, and the Golden Key
Society.

“I get swamped,” he said, laughing
and looking at his appointment book.
“I’m having a rough semester. I’m not
showing my usual academic excel-
lence.”

Riemer doesn’t regret his decision to
pursue a career in industrial engineering.
He thinks that some people classify his
career choice as a gutsy move because it
is so challenging and difficult. Although
itpromises to provide security, he won-

 

ders if it is a “wimp move.”

“To be quite honest, I have a weird
philosophy on life,” he said. “I have a lot
of trouble doing things just for me. I’m
probably an engineer for the wife and the
kids that I don’t have yet. I think itis a
future thing. And I don’t want anyone

that comes along after me to have to
worry about money ever again.”

When Riemer graduates next year,
he hopes to get into business school at
MIT or Carnegie Mellon. He wants to be
a “business boy who wears Brooks
Brothers by day and Armani by night.”
His current motto is, “the 20s are for
learning, the 30s are for earning.”

However, he does admit that it will
be really hard to say goodbye to Pitt
when he graduates. Although he doesn’t
have a trust fund to stay here forever, he
thinks that with all the involvement that
he has here at Pitt, he has never felt
involved enough.

“When I first got here, I thought,
‘Who the hell are the SGB? How did

‘ they get there?’ Now I am one of them,”

he said, laughing. “Be careful what you
wish for.” - '

photography on his own for almost
two years. He and Covarrubias met
last fall at a Latin American
Culture Union meeting and started
talking photography. H e
returns to the table with a photo
album of a trip to Italy in hand. “I
like to look, I’m always looking,”
he says, as Covarrubias leans in
and the two begin to ﬂip through
the photos.

“That’s beautiful,” Magro says,
pointing to a picture taken inside a
church. “See, they’re missing part
of the altar, though,” he adds, cri-
tiquing the snapshot’s composition.

“We travel to do our job, and
it’s like a little vacation. We went
up to Erie this weekend and got
some -nice sunset shots,” Magro
says. “Oh, we’re going to have to
go to Italy,” he says to his partner.

“Ninety percent of photogra-
phers don’t know marketing strate-
gy for stock,” Magro says. His first
six months in business on his own
were terrible because he didn’t
know how to pinpoint his market.
He had received a Bachelor’s
degree in photography while in the
Army and served as battalion pho-
tographer. He knew he could turn
his passion into profit when he sold

a shot he had taken of a missile site
in Sinai, Egypt to a private buyer.
Magro later realized ‘how much
more money he could have made
had he sold a print
and not the origi-
nal slide. He
attended a photog-
raphy seminar in
New Orleans,
where he learned
to pinpoint his
market. He now
makes a living off
his talent and pas-
sion for photogra-
phy-

He considers
the stock photog-
raphy business to
be an open market because of pho-
tographers’ individual styles.
That’s why he saw Covarrubias as
budding talent rather than competi-
tion in his field.

“I might have close-ups, where
he might have wide-open shots,”
Covarrubias explains. “We might
shoot the same building from dif-
ferent angles.”

“Our styles are very different.
Sebastian’s a great photographer,”
Magro admits, “but he didn’t know
how the marketing system
worked.”

Covarrubias, a communications

“I didn’t think I

I didn’t want to do

says.

Magro let
Covarrubias in on the secrets he
uses to sell his own photography,
and now they send out their work
to magazines under one agency
name. The partners hope to hire
other photographers for Introspect
Images by mid-summer, marketing
their work for them and taking a
percentage of the profits for the
company.

“I’m still doing what I did
before, it’s just in a gallery now.”
Covarrubias says.

“Oh my god, I’m in love,”
Magro exclaims, pointing to an

white, that’d be so powerful.”

He makes sure to slip his busi-
ness card to the women when he
returns the photo album.

The stock photography done by
Introspect Images is generally
unsolicited work. Magro and
Covarrubias mail their photos to
specific publications and the maga-
zines subsequently pay the agency
for each photo used. The going rate
for one-time publication rights is
anywhere from $35 to $100 per
photo, and the shots can be resub-
mitted and reused by the maga-
zines. Magro usually receives
around $75 for his shots each time
they are used. Introspect
does some assignment work for
publications as well. The
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has asked
Introspect to cover Penguins
games, and Inside Sports used
some of Magro’s shots of Pitt’s
Homecoming game last fall.

While Introspect Images’ main
work is in stock photography, the
partners also do some service and
decor work as well. These prints
are framed and exhibited in a
gallery or sold to individuals for
home or office decoration. Some of

the photos can overlap categories.
For example, Covarrubias’ shot of a
silhouetted girl climbing bars on a
playground hung in their gallery
show. If the girl’s face had been
visible, he would have used the
shot in his stock work for maga-
zines. Introspect also does some
service photography for individuals
or organizations desiring portraits.
Introspect Images’ first art
show, titled “Urban Visions,” ran
from February 7-15 in Bloomfield
Artworks Gallery. “The show was
something put together more on
contrast of talent,” Magro says. His
pieces in the exhibit presented
Pittsburgh in silhouettes, while
Covarrubias’ shots showed the
city’s architectural beautyvup—close.
Bloomfield Artworks owner John
Mowder has received only positive
comments about the Introspect
show from gallery clients. The
show was Mowder’s first experi-

ence showing photography in his

gallery, and he said he enjoyed the
work of Covarrubias and ‘Magro.
Mowder, an artist himself, said of
the photos, “There is a lot of sensi-
tivity, and that’s exciting for me to
see.”

“I’d be considered an abstract

photographer,” Magro admits. “My

favorite subject is color in the sky.
I like to get silhouettes against a
color background.” Magro’s project
for the show was to capture the
sky’s color at sun-
set from his
B l o o m f i e l d
rooftop over a 6-
month period. The
subject of his
pieces was not the
city skyline, as
seen in the tradi-
tional shots of

from Mount
Washington. “I

to come in to the

explains that a photographer can be

‘trained to follow a certain formula

in composing stock photography
shots, but he has to have an eye for
things to be able
to shoot.

“We pick
subjects we like
to do and target
that ‘ market,”
Covarrubias says.
“For example, we
both like kids.”
Magro often uses
his 2-year-old
daughter as a sub-
ject, photograph-
ing her playing
around the house.
He sold a shot of
his daughter
asleep wearing
her pink Reeboks to the sneaker
company. The photo ran as a
Reebok ad in the Oct.’96. issue of
Inside Sports magazine.

and related items wholesale and
then send the film out to developers

against the local company that
enlarges the‘ slides into prints
because it- has lost the negative to
one of Covarrubias’ shots exhibited
in the show. The loss could cost
Covarrubias possible sales, not to
mention his reputation.

“I like to plan where I’m going
to shoot,” Magro says. “Of course,
things may change once I get there,
but I like to be somewhat pre-
pared.” Covarrubias’ style differs
from his partner’s not only in what
he shoots, but also how he gets the
shot. His tries for a more freelance
style.

“I just go ' on instinct,”
Covarrubias says. “Something pulls
me into each shot and they always
come out better than I thought. I
like to take shots of something you
walk by all the time, but make you
say, ’I never looked at it that way.’
I took a photo of a wire garbage can
in New York that looks really cool,
but it’s just a garbage can. There
was also a park bench in which the
surrounding area looked really
ugly, but the shot is focused on the
wood grain and it’s cool.”

Covarrubias says he looks dif-
ferently when uses different films.

Rogers

After the ACTF this weekend,
he plans to attend an intensive
workshop that a group called
“Shakespeare and Company” offers
in Massachusetts. “Shakespeare
and Company” also works here on
campus with vocal training for the
Pitt theatre.

Rogers chose Pitt’s masters
program because of Sarah Barker,
the head of MFA
training. He said
she had a commit-
ment not only to
make him a better
actor, but a better
person too.

Some might
think it’s surpris-
ing to have an
African—American
portraying a char-
acter like the prince of Denmark,
but Rogers said this is just one
more step in reaching out to the
audience.

“I don’t want attention because
I’m black. I want attention because
I’m an actor.”

Rogers felt that Barker was one
of the only people who could have
a cultura1ly—diverse class without
making him feel that he was the
token black student.

Stephen Coleman, head of the

 

THE PITT NEWS

 

theatre arts department at Pitt, has
known Rogers for three years.

“He’s a very talented and bright
young man. His greatest assets are
his intelligence and imagination,”
said Coleman. . ’

Coleman said he feels Rogers’
success is something he deserves,
and said it “reﬂects very well” on
the theatre program and Pitt.

“It’s a tran-
sitional step for
him, and he will be
able to go on to
better things,” said
C o 1 e m a n .
“Hopefully agents,
casting people, and

directors attend
these things in
Washington.”

“[Rogers] is
very serious—minded and has a lot
of energy for his goals,” said Bryn
Jameson, the director of
“Shakespeare In The Schools.”

Whether Rogers wins or not he
still plans to attend the
“Shakespeare and Company” work-
shop and push his career ahead.

Rogers describes his need to act
and pursue his acting career in
terms his mentor used: “This is my
ministry, and this is how I speak to
people.”

With black and white film, he looks
for texture and deep contrast. When
using color, he says he looks for
color differences. “A yellow next
to an orange would come out the
same tone of gray in black and
white,” he explains. Covarrubias
learned the possibilities in using
color film only recently, when he
started doing stock work.

“In school, they teach you tech-
nique, but they don’t teach you
how to market,” Magro says. Most
photographers then turn to studio
work. In a phone book listing under
photography, hundreds of entries
appear under service photography,
while only a handful of stock pho-
tographers are listed.

“There are a lot more maga-
zines out there that buy shots than
there are studios,” said Magro.
However, many prospective stock
photographers may send an entire
portfolio to a magazine, which
probably wouldn’t be interested.

An editor would be looking for a
specific shot needed to accompany
a story to run in the next issue.

“We target the market,”
Covarrubias, who is set to graduate
this year, explains. Introspect
Images sends 20 shots taken on a
playground to Parenting magazine
and has a greater chance of one, or
even several, of them being bought
and used in the publication.
Introspect also sells to Parents,
Inside Sports, and Outdoor maga-
zines regularly.

Magro has been invited to ref-
eree the Tae Kwon Do State
Championships to be held in
Pittsburgh in March. He is a
national champion and member of
the ‘91 U.S. Pan—American Tae
Kwon Do team. He is excited about
the opportunity and says he will be
refereeing with his camera around
his neck.

“If you have a dream, you

might as well go catch it,” he says.‘_

Students need to voice their
views in food service bidding

The battle to be the company to feed Pitt students has
begun. Bids will be accepted until May 15, and a final
decision will be made by July 1.

We would like to commend the Student Government
Board -on its work of gathering information from students
about what they want in food service on the campus and
in putting together a packet filled with that information.
The SGB did a ﬁne job of representing the students’
interests when it came to food services.

We would also like to commend the Food Services
Committee for holding student gatherings to get student
input. This is an example of a mechanism of the
University actually putting student concerns on the table
in the decision—making process. Hopefully, other com-
mittees throughout the administration will follow their
lead.

Marriott expects to get the bid and to be the provider
of food services again next year, but it is not the only
company in the running.

The University’s criteria in choosing a food—service
company include looking at what the company will give
back to the University — i.e.., Pitt wants kickbacks.
However, kickbacks to the University aren’t going to
improve student satisfaction with the food service itself.

Students, the time is now to make your voice heard
about what you want from Food Services. Make your
suggestions to the University, not Marriott. Contact Food
Services, which is headed by Betsy Sallade—Farina. They
are the ones making the decision, not Marriott, which is
just a competitor for the slot.

Now, it’s time for the students to get off their keisters.

The term “student activism” has been kicked about in
many forms this year. From Bigelow Boulevard to the
bookstore, it has come into play. Food service is one
complaint of much of the student body at Pitt. It isn’t an
issue that affects only a select few; it touches everyone.
Use your voice, and make your opinions on food service
heard. Make student apathy a complaint of the past.

Race relations atPil1 are improving

 

Second in a series of “parting
shots.”

Nearly 18 years ago, when I
graduated high school, I decided to
take what some may consider a
major gamble.

I wanted to ﬁnd out for myself:
Could a black person make it in this
allegedly racist world without the
support of the various black institu-
tions that most folls have tradition-
ally depended on?

So when I entered Georgia
Tech in the fall of 1979, and when I
ended up at Pitt a year later, I decid-
ed to bypass the black student
groups, ﬁatemities, and churches,
and build signiﬁcant relationships in
the mainstream of campus life.

Imaybebiased, butlthinkmy
gamble has paid off so far.

VV1th relatively few exceptions,

I’ve had little trouble being accepted

for who and what I was. I joined
Zeta -Beta Tau Fratemity in 1982
and Shadyside Presbyterian Church
two years later, and I’ve recently
been nominated for the board of
deacons —- this was the second time
I was asked.

So, what have I learned? That
we don’t know anywhere near as
much about white society as we
think we do.

This may surprise you, but race
relations have improved tremen-
dously since I ﬁrst entered Pitt. If
that sounds crazy, consider that in
the 1980s I never saw blacks and
whites talking to each other under
any circumstances for any reason,
with the possible exception of par-
ties over at my ﬁat. In fact, the psy-
chic separation that existed in those
days was so strong I could go a
month without talldng to another
black student. I heard that one black

student even told a white friend of
his, “I can’t be seen with you any-
more because my friends are getting
on my case.”

Today, however, I do notice a
lot more interaction, which I take as
a positive sign. On more than one
occasion, I’ve even overheard peo-
ple make plans to go out together,
which is especially signiﬁcant since
I’m generally on campus only in the
evening.

And the truth is, I am certainly
heartened with the way that things
are going in that area. Sure, there’s a
whole lot that needs to be done, and
it won’t happen overnight, but as
long as more people start looking at
issues of race and racism the way
we do today, I see real progress. The
evening before the Ku Klux Klan
rally, I participated in a long-
planned service at my church hon-
oring Martin Luther King, Jr.

And even conservative whites,
stereotypically considered racist by
acclarnation, are taking the lead in
ﬁghting racism. You may have
heard of the Promise Keepers, the
fast-growing evangelical Christian
men’s ministry which has made
racial reconciliation a top priority. In
fact, it may surprise you to learn that
nearly half of the board of directors
and speakers are “people of color”
— another good sign. And with the
tremendous response that the KKK
rally provoked, there just might be a
lot more people who reject racism
than we’re sometimes ready to
admit.

The question thus arises: How
do we, as black people, respond to
this unprecedented outpouring of
goodwill?

Unfortunately, too often with
cynicism. That’s understandable,
considering that hope has often
given way to the reality that racism
still lives. Some will even tell you

that it’s a permanent ﬁxture » in
American society.

Well, I don’t believe it is. It’s
just a matter of how tenacious we
are in really doing something about
it.

And in fact, I see exactly one
way to do so, by doing what I did —
build signiﬁcant, committed rela-
tionships across racial lines.

We all know that this spring
marks the 50th anniversary of
Jackie Robinson’s entry into major-
league baseball as the ﬁrst black of
the modern era However, there’s a
whole lot more to the story than
meets the eye.

For 9‘ openers, Brooklyn
Dodgers General Manager Branch
Rickey didn’t tap Robinson for that
honor because he was the best black
ballplayer around; he wasn’t. He
chose him because he knew he had
the ability to take the most abuse
without reacting to it.

But Rickey had another moti-
vation.

You see, he also wanted to cre-
ate a team cohesiveness and charac-
ter that would, and did, take the
Dodgers to the World Series. When
Robinson came up, some of his
teammates (whom Rickey would
get rid of) refused to play with him.
However, by 1950, he had so
endeared himself to them with his
stellar play and regal demeanor that
when opponents used racial slurs
against him, the rest of the team was
willing to ﬁght. ‘Nulf said.

Therein lies our challenge. Do
we have the guts to ignore those lit-
tle slights and not react accordingly,
knowing that in doing so we help
raise the moral integrity of the entire
human species? If so, we will give
new meaning to the old civil-rights
theme song “We Shall Overcome.”
Rick Nowlin hopes to overcome

someday.

have exempliﬁed excellent character, or are

Now when it comes to students I am
refening to the students who have either dis-

face it, most of the students at this school
either don’t know, don’t care, or are just too
socially inept. Many people classify leaders
as people in leadership positions. Well, I am
sony, but I don’t feel thatis what determines
leadership.

Many people are in leadership positions
because they went through the right motions,
were involved with the right organizations,
have held the necessary positions, and got to
know the right people. I have seen many of
these people throughout my four years here

Review ot Rushdie

 coverage is mixed

I would like to thank Melissa

§7Blackwood and Anne Estonilo for their ﬁne
articles on Salman Rushdie’s reading and
»-visit to our campus. I would also like to

respond to theApril 10 editorial and the con-

cem that students are excluded ﬁorri such

events.
Ticket distribution for the Rushdie event

I was diﬂicult and awkward due to the securi-
I ty requirements, but we went to great lengths

to be sure that students were invited — in

“fact, we were guided at every stage by our

comrriitrnent to make this event available to
undergraduates. This was the dean’s first
concem when I raised the idea of bringing
Rushdie to campus. The rriajoiity of the
available tickets went to students (both grad-
uate students and undergraduates), provi-
sions were made to admit students at the
door, and I would estimate that students
made up a good two—thirds of the audience.
Several undergraduate groups were invitexi
to the reception after the reading. Rushdie
commented later in the evening that he was
impressed by the students he had met and by
the numbers in the audience. Students were
invited, they were present, and they made a

ﬁne showing.

Mike Long's comments

I weremade in jest

I have had the pleasure to know Mike
Long for several years, and as his friend, I
must clear up a few misconceptions that
were presented in the article “College
Republican inﬁltrates SGB to promote cori-
servatism.”

First of all, I sincerely doubt Mike Long
is “threatened” by the homosexual lifestyle,
as stated in the article. Mike, along with
many other conservatives (including
myself), simply does not condone such a
lifestyle. . i
More importantly, many of those who
do not condone homosexuality DO NOT
harass or degrade homo-
sexuals. Mike is included
in this group. As long as I
have known him he has
NEVER referred to
homosexuals using
derogatory terms. His
comment during the
College Republicans
meeting was made in jest,
and he has since stated
that he was not speaking
for the Community Relations Committee.

So, to the members of CWO or
BiGaLA who say they have been “victim-
 by students on campus: I feel your
pain. I have been called names since kinder-

 

garten. However, do not dare lump Mike
Long (or all conservatives, for that matter)
into the group of homophobic, discriminato-

KKK debate neglected
some important points

The articles published by The Pitt News
over the past week have all neglected sever-
al extremely important aspects of the debate
over the Ku Klux Klan’s recent Pittsburgh
appearance.

First of all, fascism is obviously not a
peculiarly American phenomenon, as p.r.
taylor seemed eager to
maintain with her usual
combination of sarcastic
levity and arrogance. It
is, rather, a more com-
plex manifestation of
worker alienation, eco-
nomics, and the desire to
gain control over one’s
life. If the Ku Klux Klan
is composed of “com-
plete nutters functioning
on too much testosterone and too few brain
cells,” as taylor asserted, they do so, not sim-
ply out of their idiocy, but rather as a reaction
against a broader network of social and cul-
tural circumstances. (Incidentally, the same

may also be said of millenarian religious
cults such as Heaven’s Gate.)

Secondly, fascism will not pass silently
away if we choose to simply ignore it — wit-

. tress, for example, the iecerrt electoral suc-

cesses ofthe National Front Party in France.
Whileitmaybereassuringtothinkthatthe
K has outlived itself and that rriost
Americans are now immune to its message,
these are, in fact, very dangerous and tenu-
ous aigurnents in which to place one’s faith.
EvenwhenitissafetoassumethattheKlan
and its aﬁiliates are not viable contestants
either for public oﬂice or for mass political
support, one must continue to recognize fas-
cist elements as participants in a much
broader political spectrum. When Klan
speeches cease to ignite public outrage,
when Klan members are simply ignored or
dismissed as fringe reactionaries or “nut—
ters,” other aspects of public dialogue silent-
ly edge rightward as well. That is, when the
extreme right becomes even more extreme
and more vocal, it pulls the center along with
it in the absence of mobile and articulate
alternatives.

In this context, as in any, ignoring the
threat of fascism is inevitably more threaten-
ing than recognizing the volatile legitimacy
it aheady possesses. And one would hope
that joiunalists would be acutely aware of the
danger of silence, of the importance of mem-
ory and public dialogue. 4

makes the postseason for the
first time in four years.

For the first time since the
1991-92 season, the Pitt
Panthers men’s basketball team
found their way to the postsea-

that Pitt followed, but a solid
Big East squad did claw their

second round to Arkansas 76-

make postseason play.

Panthers, the Athletic
Department announced that
starting in spring 1998, Pitt will
compete in women’s softball.

When gymnastics star George Anderson
found out Pitt had discontinued its men’s _pro—
gram, a lifetime of gymnastics training ended.

Anderson was forced to decide between
continuing his athletic career at another school
or staying at Pitt. A

Anderson chose to stay at Pitt and, after
ﬁghting through a bunch of bureaucratic obsta-
cles, join the diving team. Since joining the
squad, Anderson has qualiﬁed for the NCAA
zones in only his second season.

Along the way, in an era of high—proﬁle,
two—sport athletes, Anderson has become one
of the most versatile Pitt athletes ever.

“I didn’t know much about diving,” said
Anderson, “but I wanted to be in a sport and

 

getting much.”

“I don’t think they justiﬁed why they did
rt.”

“It was like a punch in the face.”

- At the season-ending ECAC champi-
onships, Anderson said the program was noti-
ﬁed that it was in jeopardy because of budget
constraints.

“They told us we had at least two more
years. That’s all we hear 

Although he knew the gymnastics pro-
gram might be cut before his senior year,
Anderson had no intention of transferring.

After opening that letter, however, trans-
ferring becarne one of his options.

Anderson wrote a list of the pros and cons
of staying at Pitt, and made his decision a week
later.

a program.

The summer after his
freshman year, Anderson
retumed from another grueling,
four—hour workout at the local
gym to ﬁnd a letter from.the
University of Pittsburgh.

“We get letters from Pitt
all the time for tuition and
NCAA scholarship informa-
tion,” said Anderson. “I
thought it was just another let-
ter.”

It wasn’t.

This photocopied, repro-
duced letter said Pitt had'dis-
continued its men’s gymnastics

“I was devastated,” said
Anderson, a junior.

“They didn’t care who
they were dealing with. The let-
ter wasn’t even personaliz .”

The letter said that because of Title IX, the
University was adding women’s soccer and
dropping men’s gymnastics and men’s tennis
instead of adding more women’s sports.

“That’s not the purpose of Title IX,” said
Anderson.

“The University looked for another easy
way out. They were too worried about being
politically correct.”

Anderson, who said two of his teammates
weren’t notiﬁed and read the news in the paper,
found it difﬁcult to understand the University’s
decision.

“It wasn’t about money. All [the

University] did was pay for a couple hotel

rooms a few times and let us use a van.”
Anderson also said the University paid for

some of the equipment, which is still used by
the women’s team.

“It wasn't about what we were getting,”
said Anderson. “because we obviously weren't

“At that point I was alright
with stopping,” Anderson said of
his gymnastics life. “I didn’t do it
because I was getting money for
school or because I knew I had a
future in it.”

“My goal wasn’t to make
the NCAAS or ECACS. My goal
was to get better and achieve
monthly goals I set for myself.”

“I didn’t care if I was the
only one in the world doing
gymnastics. It was fun for me
competing against myself.”

This competitive nature,
along with ﬁnding a vent for his
frustration, is what drove
Anderson to join the diving
team.

“I just wanted to drop
everything and start over. I want-
ed to do something new to keep my mind off
gymnastics.”

“I just looked ahead at what I can do from
now on. Just being a student, there’s not much
you can do to change the fact that they dropped
it.”

There was a problem, though. Oval
Jaynes, Pitt’s former athletic director, said
Anderson could only join the team if they trans-
ferred his gymnastics scholarship to diving,
which meant a diving scholarship would be
taken away. In other words, he wasn’t allowed
to walk on without penalizing the diving team.

“I was trying to help the University, and I
had to ﬁght for it.”

Anderson read his NCAA binder, which
said that if an athlete’s sport was cut at the
option of the university, the scholarship can’t be

“When lithe NCAA] heard the story, they

were upset at the University,“ said Anderson.

Anderson

who noted that the N CAA’s letter was signed in
pen and not photocopied. “They said it was ﬁne
and wished me good luck.”

Although Jaynes was wrong, he never
called Anderson to apologize or wish him luck.

“I expected that,” said Anderson. “He did-
n’t have that great of a reputation.”

“I needed something to keep my mind off
Oval Jaynes,” Anderson said smiling, “and div-
ing was it.”

“I was taking it real personal,” said
Anderson about gymnastics? being cut. “I
wanted to show them I could be in a Division I
sport and exist and be a competitor.”

Anderson has done more than just exist.
He was Pitt’s No. 2 diver this year and was
named “Most Improved Diver” by Head
Diving Coach Julian Krug for the second time.

At the NCAA prequalifying zones,
Anderson ﬁnished ninth but thinks he can
make NCAAs next year.

“I hope I make NCAAs next year, but ifI
don’t it’s no big deal,” said next year’s top diver
and new team captain. .

“Even if I had a shot [at the NCAAs],
they’re not going to care at a job interview. I’d
rather skip it and do well on a test.”

Being an environmental-engineering
major, Anderson has skipped many practices to
study for tests and to complete projects. One of
the beneﬁts of diving over gymnastics is that
diving practice doesn’t take as much time and
is more ﬂexible.

“I knew I could concentrate on engineer-
ing more,” said Anderson, who GPA. is
around 2.9.

“I don’t have any regrets,” Anderson said
about staying at Pitt. “I’m going to get a good
engineering degree and get a good jo .”

Anderson became interested in pursuing
an engineering career in his sophomore year of
high school.

The state of New York offers a program in
which students can take extra classes in a par-
ticular area of study and receive a regents diplo-
ma. Anderson took classes in electrical, assem-
bly production, and industrial engineering,
drafting and computer drafting, and designing
factories.

“I had won the electrical-engineering and
production—engineering award, so I decided to
stick with it.”

Just a year earlier, Anderson became inter-
ested in diving.

“I didn’t even know diving existed until
my freshman year in high school. I didn’t think
it was a sport.”

“My friends on the swim team told me,
‘Why don’t you try it‘? You’ll probably be pret-
ty good at it,’” said Anderson, who was a three-
year letter winner at Liverpool High School.

While gymnastics remained his top prior-
ity, Anderson dabbled in diving and was pretty
successful. He finished seventh in one-meter
diving as a junior and l2th as a senior at the
New York state competition, although diving
was more of an extracunicular activity than a
passion. V

“My junior year‘. ljust fooled around with
it. I pretty much did gymnastics on the diving
board; that’s all I knew."

Diving was a challenge to Anderson
because its style contrasts with that of gymnas-

'I'I-IE PI'I"I' NEWS ‘I 7

 

 

tics. Being a gymnast requires power and
strength, while diving has an elegance and
smoothness to it.

“I couldn’t be as explosive as I wanted to
be.”

“In diving, you just think about what you
want to do and visualize it.”

Anderson, who began taking gymnastics
classes when he was six years old, visualized
becoming a Division I gymnast when he was
13. By the time he graduated from Liverpool,
Anderson was all—1eague, all—section, all-state,
and a two-event all-American.

Anderson got started in gymnastics more
as a safety precaution than anything else.

“My mom put me in gymnastics because
she didn’t want me to hurt myself,” said
Anderson, who grew up doing ﬂips off his fam-
ily’s couch in Syracuse suburb of Liverpool.

“I was climbing fences when I was two
years old and trying to do stuff on a little set of
rings on the swing set.”

A friend’s mom told Anderson’s mom to
emoll George at the same gyrrmastics school
that her son attended. A natural, Anderson took
immediately to gymnastics —— so quickly, how-
ever, that his ﬁiend became ﬂustered.

“By the second day he quit,” Anderson
jokingly said of his friend, who had taken gym-
nastics classes for almost a year.

“Gymnastics was fun,” Anderson said.
“Sometimes I didn’t want to go, but my mom
kept me in it.”

Even if he didn’t stay in gymnastics, a
busybody like Anderson was sure to ﬁnd some-
thing else to keep himself occupied.

Anderson played a year of baseball,
although he admits it required too much stand-
ing around and not enough action.

“I wasn’t impressed with it,” said
Anderson. “I didn’t see the point to it then, and
I still don’t see it.”

“I think it’s a law that everyone has to play
baseball.”

As the quickest kid on the team, Anderson
patrolled center ﬁeld.

“All I did was bunt and steal bases.”

When he wasn’t tearing up the dusty dia-
monds of summertime, Anderson was "playing
in a tennis league twice a week. ,

“It was something my mom made me do
to keep me out of trouble.”

He also played ﬁve years of soccer for
Arby’s traveling team.

“I never stopped going."

“I had gymnastics practice every day and
soccer practice two or three times a week, with
a game on Saturday,” said Anderson, who often
played pickup football with his friends after his
practices.

Ironically, Anderson will retum to the
same soccer ﬁeld this summer as part of his
internship with Lockheed-Martin, an environ-
mental engineering company. It seems that
there’s a pollution problem in that area, and
Anderson will assist in the cleanup. In fact,
he’ll be taking samples from the same field and
creek where he played growing up.

“I used to play in that creek, and my
cousins are- playing in it now. When I found out
[about the pollution]. I called my aunt and told
her they’ll come out glowing."

Their cousin already is.

running backs, Pepe Pearson and fresh-
man David Boston, each ran for three
scores. To add insult to injury, the
Buckeyes’ leading rusher was third-
stringer Joe Montgomery, with 109
yards. 2 

The Panthers managed to cross mid-
field only one time during the entire con-
test. A_ ‘
Johnny Majors commended John
Cooper and his team on their chivalryf
“I think they made an effort to keep

the score under 70 points, and we just
couldn’t do it. I’m not being sarcastic.
That’s just a fact.”

5. Mark Bodo and John Withrow win
all—America honors.

The Pitt wrestling team has been one
of the most successful programs at Pitt,
and this year two of their top Competitors
reached a level that only eight men from
every weight class ever reach in a sea-
son: all—America. '

 

' om: :4" LARGE om: worms 8 I'

Mark Bodo, a 190-pound junior, and
John Withrow, -a 167-pound senior, led
Pitt to an 18th—place ﬁnish in the nation-
al championships held in mid-March at
Northern Iowa University. This marked
the 11th time in the past 12 years that Pitt
has ﬁnished in the Top 30 nationally.

Bodo’s fourth—place ﬁnish gave him
consecutive all-America seasons, and
Withrow’s 33-9 record for the year pro-
pelled him to an eighth-place ﬁnish, still
good enough. Withrow also earned all-
America honors during the 1994-95 sea-
son at 158 pounds.

4. Maile hits for 40 against ‘Nova.

He was in a zone.

He was on ﬁre.

He was feeling it.

No matter what catchy phrase you
used to describe it, Jason Maile7s perfor-
mance on Feb. 12 was one of the most
amazing displays of pure shooting ever
witnessed at the Fitzgerald Field House.

Hy: Itt Medic: --

Bodo and Withrow keep Pitt's
wrestling tradition going.

“I got in the

said following the
game.

Maile knocked

ers, tying a school
record, en route to
his career night.

3. Men’s swim-
ming wins the Big
East champi-
onships.

It’s a Big East
tradition for the
winning team to
jump off the 10-
meter platform.
However, the 1997 championships were
marred by police and conference ofﬁ-
cials huddling around the platform to
prevent Pitt from celebrating their 12th
championship. Instead of taking 'the
jump at Rutgers, they were honored at
halftime of the men’s basketball game
against Boston College on Feb. 23.

“That was exciting for the guys,”
Head Coach Chuck Knoles said. “It
shows how Steve [Pederson] and the ath-
letic administration have supported the
swim program.”

leading the Panthers to the title.

“This is an extremely excit-

at the press conference. “I’ve
been at schools with great tradi-
tions [like] Ohio State,
Tennessee, and Nebraska. Now
I have an opportunity to be at a

tions.”

ball program to back-to-back
national championships in 1995
and 1996.

In his two years at
Nebraska, Pederson raised over
$20 million for renovations to
the stadium, an area where Pitt
needs great strides as well. On
top of that, Pederson helped
negotiate a major shoe contract
for the school and marketed
Nebraska apparel all across the
nation.

Pederson set
his goals high,

Coach Johnny Majors in
November, Pederson was faced
with bringing in a new leader to
help dig a team out of the cellar.

Walt Harris has his work
cut out for him, there is no argu-
ing that, but his track record
demonstrates a long line of suc-
cess —— and as recently as help-
ing the Ohio State Buckeyes to
a win over Arizona State in the
Rose Bowl.

Since he began coaching at
El Camino High School in
California in 1969, Harris has
been a part of winning pro-
grams. Some of these programs
include California, Illinois, and
Tennessee, where he worked
under his predecessor Johrmy
Majors as assistant head coach
and offensive coordinator.

When asked if Majors will
play a part in the new Ham's era
of Pitt football, Harris noted,
“The only thing Coach Majors
said is that he’ll help if asked.
He’ll be in the background and
will never be in my way. He’s
one of the guys I respect most as
a football coach. He gave me
my first opportunity as an offen-
sive coordinator at Tennessee,
and I respect and honor him for
what he stands for and what
he’s done at this school.”

There were rumors all over
Pitt’s campus and throughout
the Big East that legendary
Head Coach Johnny Majors

On Monday, Nov. 25,
Majors put all of those rumors to

“I will miss coaching, but I

“With a win over Rutgers in

During his first stay at Pitt,
Majors went 33-13-1 and won

The Backyard Brawl is coming to Pitt
Stadium this weekend.

No, it’s not some sort of football
scrimmage, but West Virginia’s track and
ﬁeld team will be making the trip up I-79
for this Saturday’s annual Panther Relays.

“West Virginia is bringing their full
team up here. We’ll have Big East com-
petition for this meet, which we haven’t
had for a while,” said Pitt Head Coach
Steve Lewis.

Assistant Coach Dave Sobal is the
director of the meet. About 10 teams will
compete here, including St. Francis,
Duquesne, and Canisius, in addition to
Pitt and WVU. That’s a relatively small
total compared to last year, when more
than twice that many teams came.

“That’s ﬁne with me,” Sobal said.
“I’d rather not put on a big meet on a
small track.”

The Panther Relays begin Saturday
morning at 9 a.m. with the men’s and
women’s 5,0()O-meter races. The ﬁeld
events begin at the same time starting with
the men’s shot put. The other events will
follow at Pitt Stadium throughout the
afternoon.

knows anything about bas-
ketball knows, that’s not
possible. Only the legendary
Jim Valvano, who did many
great things in his time, can
promise a starting position
to more than five players.
But hey, that’s an entirely
different story for another
time.

Michael Shin is the latest
prep‘ player to give Pitt a
national letter of intent, the
Panthers’ first since the
April 9 signing period
began. Shin, who averaged
17.3 points and 13.6
rebounds last season for
Monacan High School in
Richmond, Va., joins an
already impressive class. He
brings the latest 6 feet 8
inches and 230 pounds to the
field house.

One of the top recruits in
the country in both football
and basketball, Ryan
Humphrey, originally had
chosen Pitt as a candidate,
but the two-sport star from
Oklahoma will be a Sooner
next year.

Pitt still is in the running
for point guard Rashon
Burno, a 5-foot-8 defensive
whiz from St. Anthony’s
High School in Jersey City,

Shin, however, could be
an impact player for the

Panthers immediately. He
comes into Pitt as the heavi-
est player on the team now
that Blount took his frail
frame  somewhere.

The Panthers have
decent height on the front
line, but experience, girth,
and strength could be a prob-
lem when the meat of the

Big East schedule rolls
around in January and
February.

During the last off-sea-
son, Mark Blount and Gerald
Jordan both packed on
impressive, muscular
pounds, but Pitt can’t afford
to wait until the next off-sea-
son to have these fresh,
young faces burning red with
pain and strain in the weight
room.

I’m sure once these frosh
look at the likes of Jahadi
White, Zendon Hamilton,
and the rest of the big boys
around the conference, they
will think about adding a lit-
tle more than the freshman
15.

NCAA, however, restricts any
University-funded program from
raising funds.

“A few of the older swimmers
started this, but the NCAA stepped
in,” swimmer Michael
Speerschneider said. “Guys like
Matt Brady and Jeremy McClain
got it going.”

On top of raising money for the
hospital, athletes from all of Pitt’s
varsity sports visit twice a month
for at least an hour and spend time
with the patients.

“For the last 15 years, football
players have been visiting the kids,
and a couple years ago Donna Sanft
in the Pitt Athletic Department
started a program where athletes
from all the sports started coming,”
Denise Esposito, a child—life spe-
cialist at Children’s Hospital, said.
“This is really a great program.
These kids are so busy, and it means
a lot that they can give up some of
their time to visit.”

“Sometimes when they come,
that will be the only smile a child
might have that day, and it means so
much to them to have the older kids
there.”

Sanft took the program over two
years ago when Alex Kramer, an
administrative assistant to the foot-
ball program, retired.

“Just from the observation of
the patients, I can see that they have
a great time,” Sanft said. “They all
like sports and like to talk about
sports. From conversations in the
elevator with the athletes on the
way out, I see that they realize how
lucky they are to be in college, play
a sport, and be healthy.”

“Having a bad day isn’t about
losing your notebook or not having
your hair go right. It’s reality when
you have a bad illness. It affects all
of us, and we have to realize we are
blessed.”

The hospital plans to use the
money to purchase a new bumper-
pool table and arts and craft sup-
plies for the activity room.

Speerschneider also said that
the ideas for the program, which
has gone from breaking even four
years ago to the $700 this year, will
be passed down to younger mem-
bers of the team. He also expressed
his hope that it will grow even big-
ger and more successful next year.

, Nation its

True outsider
artist Fredrik Von
Hamilton . spreads
his timeless
message through
  his project,
Vampire Nation

Vampire Nation? An
ancient Egyptian community
of oppressed people? A
metaphor for the bureaucratic
brainwashing of our society?
Or ambient, celestial mixes of
music based on various ethnic
cultures? Fredrik Von
Hamilton has created all of
these things within his self—per-
petuated movement.
Hamilton’s vision of social
manipulation combined with
beautiful, ﬂowing music has
become his trademark within
the growing
Goth commu-
n i t y
Awareness
through music
has given
V a m p i r e

uniqueness
and has begun
to attract
attention from
more than the Goth kids.

Bridging the gaps between
musical influences, Vampire
Nation has its own vocabulary
for the particular sound that it
produces. Hard licks accompa-
nied by Native American and
Gregorian chants is what
Hamilton calls “coven funk.”
Classical ambience is the more
laid-back style which is called
“cold wave.” The music lies on
the edge of New Age and
industrial rock using the same
elements in different varia-
tions.

The music is only second
to the real force behind
:'\/umpire Nation. “The music is
about the book I’m writing,”
says Hamilton. “It’s not about

ghosts and ghouls, it’s about a
strong nation of people being
victimized and used for the
purpose of selfishness.” The
book includes the relevance of
the lost civilization of Galius to
the ramification of civil rights
today. Hamilton uses refer-
ences to his great-granddad,
who was a black slave revolu-
tionary, as part of his inspira-
tion.
“l’m

rewriting history,

  

    F r the

basically,” says Hamilton. “My
hands are guided by certain
gods.” His “gods” are the
ancient idols of Egyptian poly-
theism. Hamilton is a
thelomite, which is a person
who believes in these gods and
goddesses. He accredits his
education on the subject of
Vampire Nation to be from per-
sonal experience motivated by
the need to preach the truth.
His message includes this

 

notion that there are people
sucking the life out of other
people preventing them from
being their true selves, thus the

metaphor Vampire Nation.
Hamilton also hopes to one day
turn his novel into a screen-
play.

He has moved closer to his
goal by hooking up with St.
Thomas, a movie and record
label based out in California.

St. Thomas is attracted to the

  

    
 
 
 
  
 
   
    
   
  
  
  
  
 
  
   

darker side of entertainment
which includes Goth. They are
producing a documentary on
the national Goth culture where
Vampire Nation will represent
Pittsburgh’s contribution to this
underground world. The film-
ing starts at the
beginning of
April and will
feature two per-
formances which
will last l0 min-
utes. He is cur-
rently anticipat-
ing the release of
his CD on St.
Thomas, which
is due out this
summer. ‘
Although he is
getting a lot of
Goth attention, Hamilton does
not want to limit himself with
his recent success. “I”m not
locked in Goth, but the people
are not fickle and they stick to
what they like,” says Hamilton.
“It [Vampire Nation] grabs
people and touches their body
and mind to make you think.”

Also emerging as an Afro-
American artist, Hamilton’s
electronic darkness will be fea-
tured on Black Horizon, a
black TV show (in the undeter-
mined future). Last December,
Vampire Nation was also men-
tioned in a P0st—Gazette article
as one of the local struggling
black musicians.

His closing message: “Be
your own person without hav-
ing to conform; and follow
your own energy.”

for the upcoming CI) will be

performed at Laga tonight with
Lyeia and Chainsuck. Vampire

sette at the Eye of Horus.

 

“Goth.” It’s become a catch-
phrase as of late. If you’ve ever
watched The Crow, seen a Marilyn
Manson or Cure video on MTV, or
spotted the occasional person clad
head to toe in black, wearing gaudy
silver jewelry, and emitting a gener-
al aura of gloom around them, then
you’re already somewhat familiar
with the Gothic subculture. At least
you know how to spot it. But what
is it?

The roots of modern Gothic cul-
ture can be traced back to the music
of bands like. Joy Division, who
came about in the late ‘70s. Joy
Division’s punk—influenced style
was dark and full of angst. and
exemplified the inner turmoil of
lead singer Ian Curtis, whose sui-
cide shook the Gothic world. Other
bands of note include Bauhaus,
Siouxsie & the Banshees, and the
Cure, who all emerged in the late
‘70s, and also the Sisters of Mercy,
who arrived on the scene a bit later.

Gothic culture is odd in that, to
most Goths, it seems to revolve
mainly around the music.

“To me, Goth is strongly rooted
in music, and a regular once—a—week
club night is a great way to meet
other Goths or to socialize with
people who are interested in the
same music or aesthetic that you

or crucifix around his or her neck.
And don’t forget the fingernail pol-
ish and excessive black makeup
(equally applied to the faces of both
women and men).

“Fashion in the Gothic scene is
different from any other. I like
when men wear makeup and skirts.
Gothic men tend to have better
fashion sense than most women I
know” says Allison Bryan, a Pitt
student, “There’s nothing more
annoying than a guy who does a
better makeup job than we girls
do!”

Wednesdays at Club Laga on
Forbes is easily the main Gothic
event going on in Pittsburgh these
days. A garish gala of dark music
and androgynous fashion, its popu-
larity has been increasing. and it
now draws somewhere between 150
and 200 people each Wednesday
night. If you’ve never been to a
Gothic nightclub, you should check
it out at least once. Just ask
Kelly Ashkettle, Pitt student and
Laga DJ: “Goth night at Laga isn’t
as ‘different’ as people who haven’t
been there might think, especially
since industrial music has begun to
be embraced by the mainstream.

But there must be more to

“Goth is not really about death,”
says Ashkettle. “It’s about drama. I
think you’re likely to see people in
a Goth club dancing more passion-
ately and expressively than people
dance to other kinds of music. They
feel it more, I think, because it

ideal of beauty, or a realistic and
somewhat melancholy (but not
grave or pessimistic) View of the
world. This often comes across as
artsy-fartsy pretension and leads to
the stereotype that all Goths are
unapproachable and profess a “holi—

Goths, it’s merely a means of enter-

What’s Wrong With This Picture
Pitt Theatre
directed by Rich Keitel

Rich Keitel has directed many a show
in Pittsburgh, including “Jeffrey,” “Six
Degrees of Separation,” and the ‘theatre
event of the decade’ (as noted by Ted
Hoover) “The School for Scandal” last
spring. Billed as “Keitel’s Last Stan ” in
the press release, he has directed the last
Pitt mainstage of the season, and his last
show at Pitt is Donald Marguiles’ “What’s
Wrong With This Picture.” .

Marguiles’ light comedy deals with
modern Brooklyn and how a Jewish fam-
ily deals with the sudden loss of a loved
family member. Kei.tel was struck by the
play by the several coincidental connec-
tions with the play — he comes from a
Brooklyn Jewish background; he lost his
mother rather suddenly; his mother’s
name is Shirley like the 
mother in the play; and
perhaps most impor-
tantly, he empathizes
with the neurotic nature
of the family portrayed.

“What’s Wrong
VV1th This Picture” is a
Neil Sirnon-esque com-
edy that starts its story
with a Jewish family
observing the rituals of
shiva. The mother,
Shirley (Lamby
Hedge), has unfortu-
nately passed on after 
choking on moo shu pork at a Chinese
restaurant. Artie (Connor McGuigan)
opens the show juggling bagels while his

bereaved father, -Mort (David Doepken)-

sadly tries to cope» with the loss. Mort’s
sister, Ceil (Valentina Benrexi), and
Mo1t’s mother Bella (Felicia Ann Bradley)
try to get on with life and sort out what

needs to be done. Mort’s old father Sid‘

(Emilio Robles) watches TV and often
boasts "about procuring good parking
spaces. While Bella and Ceil try to help
Mort get on with life, Artie and‘ Mort
engage in some heart—to-hearts that get a
little strange. Mort persuades his son to try
on his mother’s most beautiful dress. After
some youthful protest Artie tries the dress
on and —— then — Shirley comes back!
She just comes to the door and walks in as
if nothing happened.

Mort is unbelievably overjoyed: Artie
hangs as any other 17-year-old would, but
the real treat is watching Sid interact with
the recently deceased. At the beginning he
acknowledges her and says that he’s
“sorry that such a terrible thing happened
to her.” Ceil and Bella are stunned and
Mort’s interest in life is thoroughly rejuve-
nated as he smiles and struts and shows
how happy he is to be alive. After some
playful interaction with the family, and
some damn funny moments with Sid, the
play turns to an investigation of the more

  

Thursday, April I 7, ‘I 997

 

serious aspects of death, life, and griev-
ance.

First of all, the fact that Marguiles has
the gumption and grace to quote the great
American poet Delrnore Schwartz in the
prologue to “What’s Wrong With This
Picture” is enough to make me want to see
a production of it. Keitel followed suit and
included in the program the famous quota-
tion from “The World is a Wedding” —
“In this life there are no beginnings but
only departures entitled beginnings...” and
set me up to expect to a quality—ﬁlled the-
atre experience.

Perhaps the mere - mention of
Schwartz biased my reactions to the show,
but the accomplislunents of the cast and
crew certainly lived up to the expectations
that a Schwartz quotation engenders in
me. Marguiles wrote a play that, if per-
formed well, will communicate humor
and sadness in a way that commands an
appreciation of the the-
atre. The technical staff
managed to design and
create a set that seemed
as realistic and speciﬁc
as possible. The direc-
tion and acting also
lived up to a high stan-
dard as the acting was
speciﬁc and clear. David
Doepken’s Mort was
believable and funny
opposite an energized
Lamby Hedge playing
Shirley. I enjoyed

 Felicia Ann Bradley’s
Bella, whose “Jewishness” was ingratiat—
ing and humbly accurate. Val Benrexi, a
Pitt sophomore, was very comfortable
with the role of Ceil while Connor
McGuigan’s portrayal of Artie was natural
and charming. Finally, Emilio Robles’
hilarious characterization of Sid was so
damn good that it never got stale.

“What’s Wrong VV1th This Picture”
marks the end of Rich Keitel’s career here
at Pitt, and he certainly has put together a
show that lives up to the artistic and liter-
ary standards of another great Jewish
American artist, Delmore Schwartz.

Whats Wrong With This Picture runs
tonight thru Saturday night at the Stephen
Foster Memorial Theatre, across from the
Carnegie, at 8 p.m. Tickets are $10 for

Steel Miners
Irony
Double Deuce Records

Sixteen songs by Pittsburgh’s premiere
PUNK ROCK players, the Steel Miners’
ﬁrst fu1l—length compact disc release is a
combination of material that was fairly new
at the time of its release, and older songs
previously available on various records
mostly released on Pittsburgh—based garage
purveyors Get Hip Records.

Each and every Steel Miners release is
100 percent pure quality product, and this
Double Deuce release is certainly no excep-
tion. On the ironically-titled ‘Burgh-centric
Imny, the band manages to showcase all
aspects of this highly complex modern rock
band. These guys don’t ﬂaunt their punkness
the way a band like, say Molly and the
Regicides (a totally kick-ass band, by the
way) does, but these guys are punk as fuck,
and there is no one alive who could dispute
this fact. I’ve never understood why there
has always been such a distinct fence put up

, between both older drinking punkers and the

younger punk kids and the really rockin’ Get
Hip—type bands like the Mount McKinleys
and the Steel Miners. Of course, I’ve never
understood any of the fences that exist
between virtually every clique of dope—ass
rockers in this town, but I’d better get back
to this review before I start quoting Youth of
Today lyrics or something.

If you’ve never heard the Steel Miners
before, then you probably should pick this

thing up real soon. You don’t even need to

have a record player to hear it! The whole
thing was recorded by Josh Roman atApo1lo
Studio, and it sounds damn good. Granted,
;neither Imny or its CD predecessor, the EP,
sound quite as good as the records do, and

none of these offerings could possibly live
up the the sweat—soaked spectacle of the

Steel Miners’ live performance. But what the
hell, none of you kids ever show up for their
shows anyway, so you may as well be able
to listen to the Miners in the comfort of yr
own homes.

Most of the songs are, as usual, written

|t’s finals week. Nothing like a
‘ little legal speed and some Rickety Rock
to set the pace. Check out all at these

The Sea and Cake
The Fawn
Thrill Jockey
The ﬁrst time I heard the Sea and Cake,

Iwas amazed. Itwas theﬁrstbandinawhile
that had struck me as being something new;
not new as in different or original, although
it was both, but in some other way as well.
The album was The Biz, their third, and it
contained some of the most beautiful, sooth-
ing songs I had ever heard. For a while, a day
didn’t pass that I failed to lie on my bed with
a smile on my face until it was through.
What struck me about that record was
the Sea and Cake’s ability to take a regular
four-piece band and, with the help of a key-
board, make songs so unique. They make
love songs that are not about love, as far as I
can tell. The lyrics are mostly undecipher—
able, and when they are understood, there
seems to be no cohesion from one line to the
next. Instead, they made me fall in love ——
usually with my bed, always with the music.
This one is no diﬂ’erent in that respect.

I’ve been back in my bed for about a week

the most part, the similarities end there. The

Oldham will be only Will Oldham, support-
ed by his vocal chords and a guitar (and
maybe an old, rusty drum machine?!).
Actually, one can never tell what he will do,
but I ﬁgure that the above description is a
good start.

Notthatthisallreallyrnatters.Asfaras
I am concerned, Will Oldham is/was Palace
andwillremainthatCallitwhatyou1ike,
but it is he who has remained constant
throughout name changes and different band
members, including this one. It seems to be
one more step in a direction in which he was
heading all along, whether he knew it or not.
It isn’t that the contributing musicians on
previous records had no input in the songs.
They always did, but it is always win that
gives them their special ﬂavor. This isn’t the
ﬁrst release of its kind, either. Their have
been several other Palace recordings on
which Will played solo. This single is simi-
lar to those, but it does have its distinguish-
ing marks.

First of all, these two songs do feature
Will alone with an acoustic guitar. (There is
no drum machine, but I do have reason to
believe that he pulls it out from time to time,
along with some funky disco times). You can
probably take the rest from there as far as

sound is concerned — it is basically straight-
forward folk music featuring Will’s soulful,
cracking vocals. These two are on the slow
and depressing side, and he has restrained his
singing somewhat to ﬁt the mood.

What makes this record, like any other
he has done, so attractive is not only his
strangely beautiful voice, but what he is
singing with that voice. These lyrics are as
ﬁneasanyWillhaseverpenned—arideven
better because a lyric sheet is included. I am
not one for interpreting lyrics much beyond
their face value, but I know of many people
who devotealot oftimeandenergytoﬁgur-
ing out what Will has to say. From my super-
ﬁcial analysis, I have infened about as much
as anyone could have from the song titles
alone.Iwillalsosaythatthesesongsﬁt
together quite nicely, offering a progression
or regression (as it could be looked at both
ways) on the theme of patience as it is
involved in an intimate relation. Beyond
that, there is unquestionably a gold mine of
ideas hidden in these songs, whether taken
together or separately. For those of you who
are into poetry, you will not be disappointed,
and neither will those already into Will
Oldham. Has he ever written a bad song?
