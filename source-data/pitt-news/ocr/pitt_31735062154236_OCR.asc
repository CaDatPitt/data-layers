(rave 3. charge to enact in connection

~ with the U‘niversity‘“p’aper. They are

in a measure the meansand the end
of the collegepaper. It is for them
that the publication is printed, and by
them is thequality of the printed
word determined; If the paper is to

i progress every student must take an "

interest in it. They must support it’
with copy» and ﬁnances. They must
criticize it and point out its mistakes.
.When this stage is reached the paper
will‘ rank with the. best in the United
States. ‘ . «v

To the staff it may be_,.said, keep
the column clean,‘ print the iriews of
the iUn‘iver‘siity, make the methods
above suspicion and choose men to
work on the paper for ability alone.
By, making this organization a truly
representative student

It is with -feeling of ‘regret and res
lief, that the present. staﬁ laysdown
"the. pen to those of the new board. A
feelingof regret thatfthe privilege’ of

tution that is in need of the earnest
effort of every student is at anLL;end.
On the other hand with some degree
of gladness that the troubles and ‘re-°

. At thistirne it is appropriateto give
notice that THE. WEEKLY 0 holds
nothing but goodvfeeling ‘toward all

University. In all expressions. censur-
ing anything concernedwwith student
affairs there was no motive save the
ever-present desire to be a construc-

 tive factor. f In such action it was all-

ways bac_kedL~up by facts to prove.’
iBeliLev:i_ng .thaLtt'he road, to perfection
is over a path of mistakes that have
been overcome THE'.V.VE'EKL.Y has
{censured things that deserve it, and
praised things that could stand praise.

in. it'hasLlabforedL'for others.  '

Wishing the new staff the greatest
success that has come to any preced-
ing staff, we hope that they will add
their quota-to the progress already
made byfour years of history.

ELECTION or ’CHEERLEADE_

_Now that the senate as a body has
dissolved, and the various senajtes of

duty to perform, let us hope that the
proceed to heir work speedily. t L if “
One of t e important things that
has been neglected up to the“ present
time is the .elec’cLio_n i.o_f»- cheer leader
for next year. To’let this gr longer
will mean that no ch.eerleader.:will be
elected. The Dental students will

sume a week orltwo in order to get,
all the votes in, it. means that -this
‘must be taken care’ of immediately.
The time for election. has passeda
month ago, so the duty for the Senate
or “Board of Control is obvious.
ANOTHER CONTESI
The recent contest for the locati

of the student building showed tha
thislis a veryisatisfactory method of
determining the will of the majority
of thestudents, so t~hLey~are asked to

iE’ditor Pitt Weekly:
‘ Dear Sir:--No one connected with
the University has failed to note and
comment upon the erection .-of tele-
graph poles on the campus this week.
The veryifact of their being placed
here in the midst of a so-called‘ en-
lightened community is petrifying to.
the most credulous. .  s 7‘
 These poles are a disgrace to the
Universityof Pittsburgh and a reflec-
tion ion the common sense and
aesthetic taste of/the student body. .
Thatit may be the intention that
these poles be but temporary has no
weight. We know what road good in-
teLntionsL are said to pave. These
three eyesores stick from the ground
like the tinesof. “Old Nick’s”lfork,
seeking to prod us on to some dire
folly. " “
7 De we ever} expect to beautify our
campus intoia place worth while?
Does the University stand for any-
thing aesthetic oi-artistic. Have we
come to the shame of teaching civic
pride and righteousness ingour class
rooms and perpetrating such a crime
just outside the door!

O On the Campus,
The Philosophy o£LA1umnisrn.

Alumnism, to coin a word, has «a
philosophy which is none the less real
,,and vital for being seldom fully ex-
pressed‘. ThiLsiphilo.sophy is epitom-
ized "in two, words, ‘ “force” La-ndL
“focus.” .It' believes in the maximuim
efﬁcient use, through un~ion,;of'._the
hungan units who have enjoyei:l;the

spread of -culture and forvintellectual
progress. It ldeLsire‘sL_.Lithiat“the foitces.

focused, ‘through co-operation, ~ upon
the problems‘ of the world -for Lithe.
beneﬁt of society at largeand of’;th'e
individual units. themselvesL.._-  ,5?

‘ Alumnism. is not “a cult of the"Zb"y-
Lgone.” It reveresj the past for its", ac-
«cornplishments and the lessons of its
experience, but it lights no votive
lamps upon the"alta’rsr of ancestral
worship. L Its activities. . are of the
present and for the jfutiire. The lore
of the antiquarY.it1’ie geneoLlogist.and
the historian Vhave’ -‘no ‘charm for it
save’ as‘ they contributed __;hought and
inspiration to its_rLli’vingLtswork.i,_ ‘,LLj
Alumnism is aﬂirmiative. ‘ It sta‘ndLs
for the constructive irealization. in
concrete form of its ideals. It Lngfufst
often question rand correct, but it

t Lne'v'eLr' destroys. _ Within it‘h“eL boundlsl

of ‘justice it is '-no respecter’  ‘gr-
sons. It.ho1’ds‘ the institution..w,iich

.-stant sacriﬁces-’ by many men, above

-tendencies and results rather) than in
transient exigencies. -. It is willing to
lose to-day .thLatL to-m'orrow’s~ victory
maybe more" complete. It is spatient‘
because it ispowerfjul.  7 
Alurnnism‘ is based upon“ obligation
and sentiment, but it is not senti-I‘
niental. It wills to return to society
a tithe of the harvest grown frornthe
seed which society freely gave, and
to preserve the kindly human associa-
tions which attended that growth,
that theﬁeld of" the ‘w.orl'd ma.y'Lbring

Alumnism bends all things ‘toyits
