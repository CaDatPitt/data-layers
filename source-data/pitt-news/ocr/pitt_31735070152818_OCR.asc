The Student Government Board election that
drew the fewest number of candidates has
triggered the highest number of resignations
in recent history. ' '
Board members ‘Ellie Tsatsos, a junior
studying biology and chemistry who was
appointed president pro-tempore, and Bran—
don Benjamin, a junior studying linguistics,
announced their resignations at Tuesday’s

public meeting in Nordy’s Place, marking the

second and third Board members who have
stepped down within the ﬁrst three months
of the 2014 term. '

Nites said Tsatsos and Benjamin had both
“brieﬂy discussed” their intentions to resign
during individual meetings with Nites on
Monday, ' ' I . ‘

“I wasn’t necessarily surprised,” Nites
said. “We had talked a little bit about their

. future on the Board.” _

Nites said he remains optimistic for the
future of the Board, adding that the three
Board member resignations that have oc-S
curred in the last month signal that there-
maining Board members must make internal
changes. ‘ S _ - 1 A S

Staﬁl Writer
Writing needn’t always be a private activity
for those looking to put pen to paper.

The Writing Center debuted its Writer’s
Studio -— a quiet space where undergradu-
ates can gather_to work on writing as a com-
munal activity —' this semester. The studio
occupies room_111.of the O’Hara Student
Center between 11 a.m; and 2 p.rn., and tu-
tors are available during that window to help
with writing.‘ a

‘According to Geeta Kothari, director of ‘
Pitt’s Writing Center, the public needs to ‘
change its perceptions on writing for the
studio to ﬂourish. _ .

“People have to stop thinking of it as a
solitary exercise, and that’s really hard, be-
cause there’s still the romantic notion of the -

writer and the garrett,” Kotharilsaid.
Kothari said the success of the center’s

-Graduate Dissertation Boot Camp sparked

the idea to open thelWriter’s Studio this se-
mester. During a week-long camp offered
three times a semester, graduate. students
expand, revise and seek advice on their writ-
ing. The center also offers a condensed, one-

day version of the camp during the fall and '

spring semesters.
The Writer’s Studio could give under-

graduates the same opportunity for devoted _

writing time that the center offered graduate

students, Kothari said. ' . ' ,
Robert_Stevens,~ a faculty tutor for the

Writing Center, said the Writer’s Studio dif— '

T fers from the basic offerings of the Center.

“If a student just has a quick question
about word choice, [they] can just stop in,

_get their answer and be on their way, where

the Writing Center is more of a process,”
Stevens said. - . ~ .

According to Stevens, use of the Writer’s
Studio by students has been slow so far, but

. he is hopeful that it will grow. f

The Writer’s Studio offers at least one fac-
ulty tutor available at alltimes to answer any
questions a student might have during the
writing process. According to Stevens, the
Writing Center plans to provide the studio as

an additional resource that doesn’t require a 7

25-minute appointment, as the center does.

Stevens hopes the new service will pre-
vent undergraduates from ‘fbinge writing,”
or writing an essay all in one sitting,_‘whi_ch
is something he has found many of his;stu-

. dents do.

' “We hope we can help students schedule .

 Wiri fosters undergraduate creativity, A Community  

writing and complete an assignment,” Ste-

vens said. “I  something like this will

help them to space out their writing.” '
Kothari added that the Writer’s Studio is

meant to be quieter than Hillman Library,
~ which canbe very conducive to getting work.

clone. . _

Joyce Lin, a junior accounting major, said
she prefers to write alone, but recognizes
the advantages of writing as a community._

“I think in a community, and [when]

people write together,» you could generate a

an idea that.you might never have thought

of by yoursel ,” Lin said.

Lin said she appreciates ‘having a tutor .7

available for writing help.
“I think having a tutor is better. After I
ﬁnish my writing, Igwill tryto ﬁnd atutor to

help me ﬁx my grammar mistakes,” she said. ‘

that led to his resignation, but rather the
limitations SGB set on his goals’.

“My issues aren’t workable through the
system as it is in place,” he’ said. ' N

In a statement of resignation to Nites and
the rest of SGB, Benjamin challenged the
Board to examine the loss of three members
this year and “reﬂect on what could be driv-

' V x ing such dedicated leaders away.”

Benjamin said the three resignations this

year reﬂect the Board’s heavy involvement .
in politics instead of working to restructure V

itself and detract from cyclical problems,
such as non—transparency and incomplete
projects. — '

Though the Board is currently revising
the Allocations Manual, Benjamin said he
felt the Allocations Committee members

and Board members involved did not make I

enough effort to include other voices from
campus. _

He said the Board too often got caught
up in “Allocations nonsense,” and spent the
majority of its time talkingabout money,

duringlplarming sessions. ‘A l T l 

tackle on campus,” Benjamin said in the
statement. ' « A ’ ,

Benjamin said there was ani“ove'rwhelm-
ing presence” of Board members in the Al-
locations process. ' ’ s

“We have an Allocations Committee for
a reason,” Benjamin said. “We take all too
much power on to ourselves to overturn their
decisions and take too many liberties with
what they spend so much time on.”

In the statement, Benjamin urged the
Board to shift its focus toward representing
students instead of involving itselftoo much
in the Allocations process. He said talking
to student groups requesting money solely
about allocations ‘only served to intimidate
and discourage. ' . ,

' “Remember that every decision you
make based on aﬂawed manual without
putting yourselves in their shqges, says to
these students that you’re a politician or a_
businessman, not a representative,” Benja-
min said irrthe statement. “When they ask
for money, ask what else, in addition, you

can be doing to represent them.”
_ , Benjamin saidhe and Tsatsosjdecidecl

g ' to resign together so  Board could. start
“We forget there are bigger issues to A

its interview process right away. He said he
made the formal decision to resign Monday

' night after presenting his issues with SGB to

Nites. Prior to his decision, Benjamins/aid
his reservations toward the Board’s involve-

ment in the Allocations process came up’

“sporadically” in meetings. ‘

Benjamin ran for Board on the Forward .

slate with Nites and Board member Sara
Klein .during the 2014 B_oard'election. He’
said Nites was both concerned and under-

standing about his decision to resign from ’

the Board.

Benjamin said that, as president, N ites
was “very fair,” but tended to be disorga-
nized. He said such disorganization — an

a inherent aspect of SGB — inﬂuenced his

decision to resign.

“We ran and we knew it was goingto be _

difficult,” Benjamin said. “At some point you
just run out of steam.” i ‘ ~. 7 .
_ While Nites said he might not personally

’ be thefnostaorganized person, some of the

feelings of general disorganization also stem
from “the quick nature ofbeing on Board,”

and the toll that multiple meetings andg7re- .
H sponsibilities take, on_rI.1emb'ers. , is "

‘Tsatsos said there were multiple reasons I

behind ‘her resignation, which primarily
resulted from a conﬂict in her fall semester
class schedule. _ i
Tsatsos said she must take a Tuesday
night chemistry lab next semester to gradu-

ate next spring. Tsatsos could have taken the —

class and remained on the Board if she used
her maximum number of absences, but said

. she-did not want to enter the semester with

that mentality. She said she has known about
her scheduling problem for two weeks, but
only decided to resign Monday night.

Tsatsos said she would not have resigned -

if not for the schedulinglconﬂict, but added
thatshe was “disenchanted” with SGB.

Expectations go awry

In her statement to the Board, Tsatsos .

said that she thought SGB was an organiza-
tion that would help her positively affect the

] student body. But. after joining, she “real— ‘ _
’ ized the amount of politics that come, with

the Board members have left. me feeling ‘

unsatisﬁed,” Tsatsos said.

The Board selected Nick Hufnagel, a ju-
nior majoring in French and urban studies,
to replace Radziwon at its public meeting
on March 4. Hufnagel competed against a
pool of 24 applicants who underwent pub-
lic interviews for the position. The Board

opened the applicationto students the night —

of Radziwon’s resignation on Feb. 27.
A declining fervor for this year’s SGB has
been evident since campaign season, which

_ had 11 candidates for Board as compared to" . ’ '
the 18 candidates drawn by the previous

campaign. ' B

Three slates, or_ groups of three candi-

 dates who run together, and two indepen—'
dent candidates contended for seats on the ’

2014 Board. Only two candidates who ran

'didn’t win positions. Nites said people be— _

come “disenchanted by the inner workings

of the student government,” every year, but V

the disenchantment can be found on m'ul—

“That is the nature ofbeing a student and
wanting to make change on campus and be-
ingapart of something larger than-yourself
and larger than student government,” he
said. “We are part of Pitt, and it’sla busi-
ness. It’s a university and there are politics
involved with that. That’s just a fact of life.”

N ites said that “just like anything,” there '

are always things that the Board-can ap— A

' disagreements and disorganization in terms’
of meeting times and scheduling among '

members. . _
-Tsatsos added that the amount of disor-

ganization within SGB hinders its potential

to be a productive organization.

“Rather than aiding me in getting my ini-

tiatives done, it has hindered me,” she said:
Tsatsos said it is impossible to accom-

plish each of the Board member’s three

. ' campaign initiatives, regardless of overlap

between their ideas. Tsatsos blamedthe
process of going through loopholes and
administration. 3 n '
“You just can’t do it, but not because you
don’t care,” Tsatsos said. ,
Tsatsos said she felt the Board needs
to not focus on small issues like the Board

members’-weekly reports.
“It’s okay to say no report,” Tsatsos said.

“We need to focus‘ on big picture, not who  e .j  , 5.  ,  .

Board, he declined to comment ﬁirther on
the resignations, feeling that it would be
unfair because “at this point, [he hasn’t]
spoken to the members who resigned or
the Boar ,” and he was not ﬁilly informed
to speak on the issue.

Bonner said he will speak with Nites and
the Board regarding the process of ﬁlling

will be theirs. T .
“I know they have learned a lot [about
the process] and I will discuss it with them,
but I want to leave that up to them on how
to.proceed from this point,” he said.
Nitessaid he will meet with Bonner this
Thursday to discuss the resignations and
plans for replacing the Board members.
Nites said he plans for the Board to hold
interviews similar to those conducted while
replacing Radziwon. ’ '
Nites saidthat he plans to make a more
organized process for ﬁlling the positions,
which will be completed in the next few

weeks. The Board will accept online ap-

. plications for at least a week, and then the
Board will make an appointment as soon

as possible. Nites said he will post the ap-

plication forms to the'SGB website as soon

as possible. - '
“It’s actually never been taken off the

‘ SGB website,” he said, referencing the ap-

plication that was available following Radzi-
won’s resignation. . l

The Board will then most likel'y inter-
view the applicants in two public rounds
and deliberations will be held in private as
they were upon the last selection process,

‘according to Nites. - .
“We need to be better prepared,more ’
_ open to compromising, more aware of the -
situation we are in and hopefully that will.

help to unite us,” Nites said.

"The position of president pro-tempore,
however, will be selected through an ap-
pointment and approval process. N ites said
that there is “not much guidance” on a sec-
ond appointment-process, but that he will
most likely appoint Board member Andrew
Abboud, who received the second highest
number ofBoard member votes in the 2014
Board election, to succeed Tsatsosi

‘ Typically, the president chooses to ap-

point the Board member candidate who
. received the most votes in the election as ‘

president pro-tempore, _as the highest-
vote receiver assumes the presidential role

' ' should the president not be able or willing

to fulﬁll the responsibilities of the position.
Abboud said that he would accept the
position, if appointed, and work to support
Nites as president.
“The most important thing is for me

‘ to give my support to Mike as he needs it,

because I do think he’s done a wondeijful
job  leading the'Board so far,” he said.
Optimism pervades '

The remaining Board members said they _
« are still optimistic about the remainder of

igiiations. _ j _

Board member -Mona Kazour said she
and the other members needed to continue
to faithﬁilly represent on—campus student
organizations. - ' V j_ l

“Don’t have any fear about this because
it’s not going to hinder us in any way,” she

their terms despite the recent string of res-

opportimity for improvement.

“I take it with a grain of salt and also a
grain of encouragementto be the student
group that you guys want us to be,” Abboud

said.

After speaking on behalf of the club base- .
ball_team in regard to its allocation request,
Mark Cunliffe addressed the Board, saying
that “disorganization is apparent” among
SGB. He continued, saying that two Board
members resigning does not sit well with
him as a student requesting assistance and
funding from the Board.

“When you try to reassure us that you
will still"do your job, it’s a little unsettling,”
hesaid. E A ._ ,3

way for them to serve the students, I fully

respect that,” he said.
Abboud added that Hufnage1’s quick

transition to his Board position makes him

optimistic about the impending transitions.
“This too shall pass,” he said. 4 ‘

Nites agreed, saying that he believes that B
“internally, [the Board] will function okay,”

but that they will need to approach public

meeting discussions with a willingnessto

work together and compromise. A
Compromises may be necessary in pass-

‘ ing Allocation requests that are brought

before the Board for approval or denial.-A
majority must be reached by the Board to
approve an Allocations request, meaning on
a full eight-person board, ﬁve votes are nec-
essary to approve allocations of the Student‘

- Activities Fund to student groups."
This rule still holds with a decreased num— ’

ber of Board members. - -
Five of the six Board members will have

i to vote unanimously on Allocation requests

in order for the requests to pass. _

“ Nites said “overall, [the Board is] on
track to accomplishingas much as last year’s
Board,” and that they are continuing to move

forward. Ultimately, N ites attributed the low- A

er interest in running for student government
and the high Board member turnover rate to
a natural cycle of student involvement in -the
organization. ' _

Despite the resignations, Nites said that
student groups should not be worried.

“Does it look bad that three people have
quit?"Sure,” he said. “But I think that’s just
the nature of having nine people run for eight
spots [on the Board] .” I

I Simon Brown
Columnist

My grandfather remembers the
Lawrenceville of his childhood as
the working—class, Irish—immigrant
neighborhood at the heart of “Hell
with the Lid Off,” as Pittsburgh was
known in its steel-smelting days.
Two generations later, Lawrencev—
ille is distinctly known as the “hip”-
pest neighborhood” in the city,
replete with micro—breweries and
ﬁxed—gear bicycles.

In addition to hip shops and
transportation, the young profes-
sional class now populating the
neighborhood brings about another
calling card of its culture: increasing
property values. ,

Over the past so years, the city
has evolved from rnanufacturing
hub to rust—belt shell to the sup-
posedly most livable “knowledge
economy” in the United Stgtes. This
transformation has been propelled
by outgoings and inﬂuxes of various

demographic groups. It is naive to
expect the cultures and characters
of Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods to
remain stagnant throughout the
changes, but neglecting commu-
nities’ commitments to streets,
schools and services by permitting
drastic cost ﬂuctuations will only
divide neighborhoods. A

Brooklyn ﬁlmmaker Spike Lee
recently sparked gentriﬁcation’s
trademark tensions in a 10-minute

, monologue passionately lament-

ing the changing neighborhoods
of his own childhood. His criticism
of “hipsters” claimingto “discover”
low—income, historically-black sec-
tions of Brooklyn and challenging

, the culture was quickly written off ’

as a rant. To some, his explicit talk

of implicit racial connections to

communities smacked of racism.
But Lee’s sentiments aren’t un-

' common, and they certainly aren’t

racist.
To those who have not grown

_ up in neighborhoods in which long

  

’ ocieties

its 3-

  

 

lyn, N.Y., is considered to

cultural histories are remembered
from generation to generation, his
response comes across as ignorant
of what professional young people
have to offer, at best. They bring
more disposable income, more
expensive retailers, -higher prop-
erty values and higher rents —- but
why is that bad, initself? Besides,
if property values increase, don’t
third-generation homeowners see
an equal increase in wealth?

If the story were that simple,
then Lee’s comments could be read
as an intolerant attempt to “keep
white people out” of neighborhoods
of color for no reason but distrust

In reality, the positive perspec-
tive on gentriﬁcation misses sev-

- eral economic consequences for
. low-income residents. The con-

siderable population of renters
in these neighborhoods see only
rent increases, while established
homeowners see increased prop-

erty taxes until they sell their homes. The
very idea that higher property values must be
good for native residents only bears fruit when
those residents decide to sell their homes and
move elsewhere.

Moreover, the economically—necessitated ‘

migration out of traditionally familial neigh-
borhoods can often displace residents from
easy access to their jobs — a fact only com-
pounded by the greater reliance on particular
public transit routes among lower-income
workers. All of these factors make the move
from Lawrenceville to “Upper.Lawrenceville”
less straightforward than it seems.

' — All these criticisms still simplify the un-
quantiﬁable connections between commu-

nities and neighborhoods to probabilities . _

and statistics. What is needed is a cultural

sensitivity both from those looking into and

out of changing communities. ‘ ' l '
For the natives of most suburbs, the deep-

1y—grown roots binding residents and commu-

nities appear foreign. The American suburb ‘

is largely the product of voluntary migration

— either from the post-World War II housing-

credit boom orthe post-manufacturingwhite»

ﬂight ofthe196os. V

Ihe ﬁrst and second generations of these
suburbanites now constitute much of the pro-
fessional class returning to the city—centers
of their factory-working grandparents and
great-grandparents. It makes sense that they
can’t so easily relate to deeply—rooted resi-
dents who see less-voluntary migration for
its inherent harms. ' — . ‘

And while Spike Lee may have faced criti-

cism for his blunt discussion of race, no one"

is ignorant of the fact that white ﬂight has a

distinct coloration. His Brooklyn neighbor-

hoods such as Bedford-Stuyvesant, as well as
our Pittsburgh neighborhoods such as the Hill
District, have acquired aunique meaning for

residents of color, whose ancestors created-

them as safe havens in otherwise unaccomo—
dating metropolises.

Ultimately, While racially-identiﬁed
neighborhoods may seem outdated ‘to new
city—dwellers growing up in a mythically
“post—racial” society, it is important to note
that they are still current for those who have
experienced intolerance. I ' _ _

s The 6-foot-7 freshman from Mason,
Ohio, s'uffere'd his" second loss of the
season after he was handed the ball as
Tuesday’s starting pitcher. Zeuch (1-2,
1.98 ERA) lasted four innings and al-
lowed three runs on three hits and a
pair of walks. _ , '
' He allowed two more to score in
the third inning when Munden again
reached base leading off the inning, this
time by working a walk after running
the count full. After allowing a-single
to Bobby Boyd, Zeuch struck out Billy
Fleming looking on three pitches, then
got clean-up hitter Ryan McBroom to
fly out harmlessly after falling into a
dangerous 3-1 hitter’s count.

Zeuch couldn’t come all the way
back, though, as he walked the next

Crisis at the Zoo: Students

Chris Puzia
Staff Writer

When Pitt Director of Media Relations Greg
Hotchkiss joined the school in 2002, the
Petersen Events Center had been open for
only three weeks.

But though it opened’ just 12 years ago, i

the Pete has drawn criticism for some of its
design features, which most notably prevent

the student section, the Oakland Zoo, from .

getting signiﬁcant television exposure.
“If I had been here when they designed

the Pete, I would have told them not to do’

it this way,” Hotchkiss said. “The building
was designed pretty poorly.”

While most student sections on televised
basketball games are shown at the top of the
screen, which makes them more visible, the
Zoo is instead located on the bottom, draw-
ing complaints from students. For Oakland
Zoo Vice President Nick Brenner, this hurts
the national visibility of both the team and
its student section. V

“I know a lot of people have talked about
the Zoo being shown on television,” Brenner,
a junior majoring in business, said. “It would
be awesome to get the Zoo more recognition
by showing it on TV constantly.”

However, H otchkiss acknowledged that
ﬁxing the problem would come at a huge ex-
pense, despite the fact that the poor design
of the building may result in less visibility
for the Zoo.

 

Because the Oakland Zoo cioesn’t ﬁreside behind the team benches, it doesn’t get much TV exposure.TyIer Pecyna [Assistant Sports Editor ,

“It would cost us about $1.5 million [to a

change the structure],” he said. “Because
of electric wiring, luxury suites and other

reasons, we can’t just pick up and move the
cameras. At the time theyxbuilt the Pete,
there was no Oakland Zoo, also.”

against Ohio State was canceled because of
temperatures that read in the mid 30s with
a chance of snow, but the sun was shining.

This most recent decision stretches the-

number of series that have been called off
to four. Three of those series were slated as
home games at Vartabedian Field.

This past weekend, the Panthers trav-
eled to Notre Dame for a three-game set
—- only to have the series canceled. Thea
said such letdowns have slightly bothered
the team.

“Sometimes we’re there, we’re game-
ready and it’s maybe not that cold out, the

sun’s out, but we can’t play because of the
rules,” she said, adding that rules state the
team would forfeit if it wasn’t game-ready
and weather permitted competition.
Thea said that the team remained out-
side the ﬁelds for about four hours wait-
ingfor the temperatures to rise, but they
neverdid. So instead of trying to snap a
six—game losing streak, the Panthers were
stuck inside their hotel doing homework.
By Sunday, they showed up at the ﬁeld
still in warmups with their bags packed
because they knew what was in store.
But while the Panthers are mired in a
losing streak that has the team at the bot-
tom of the ACC standings, Thea has been
on ﬁre all year. Her .368 batting average

ranks ninth in the conference and she’s

added three home runs, 11 RBIs and a .596
slugging percentage.

It seems as though the weather has
been the only thing that can halt her pro-
duction.

“It’s been truly something I’m not used
to, but I try not to think about it too much
and keep focused on the few pitches that
I’ve seen and review my video,” Thea said.
“I just keep thinking what has been going
good for me and what has been going good
for all of us.” I

The issue, though, is that not much has
even been happening for Pitt, and it might
cost the team a chance at the postseason.
The teams that ﬁnish in the top eight in
terms of win percentage in the conference

advance to the playoffs. Pitt has 28 ACC

games scheduled this year, but four of the
ﬁrst nine have already been wiped out.
With no foreseeable time to make up
the cancellations before the ACC Tourna-
ment, which begins May 8 in College Park,
Md., the Panthers have to quickly climb
out of their 0-5 start to conference play.
This weekend presents reasonable
hope to do just that when 1oth—place Vir-

excited to get on the ﬁeld after what might _

be a two—week hiatus, Thea said they’re not

a win,” she said.‘ “I deﬁnitely think this

~ ESPN and CBS have preferences that factor
' into the camera placement in arenas. The

stations like to show team benches and the
scorer’s table, and if the cameras _at the Pe-
tersen Events Center were switched, those
would "no longer regularly be on screen.

~ “You want to have the emotion of the
game caught on the benches,” Hotchkiss
said. f‘A'nd if they’re not, ESPN might sud-
denly decide they don’t want to show games

, herebecause of this,”

Butbefore the Petersen Events Center
hosted Pitt’s basketball games, thevemotion
and energy wasn’t ‘really there.

Pitt used to occupy the Fitzgerald.Field \

House, which seats about 4,000 people.

At the time construction on the new arena .

began," the Field House‘ did not even sell
out its games. . S A

Because of this, the athletic department "

at the time did not expectlaitt basketball and
its student section to improve so dramati-
cally, and did not anticipate sold— out games

' and a raucous student ‘section every game

at the Petersen Events Center.

“If the Zoo was in ﬁill force during the
last days of the Fitzgerald Field House, they
would have taken that into account when de-
signing the Pete,” Hotchkiss said. “Because

A they barely sold out the Field House, the

rationale was: ‘Why build seats for nobody
to sit in?”’

Still, Pitt is not the only major program
with its student section not caught on
screen. The University of North Carolina,
which has played at the Dean Smith Cen-
ter since 1986, places some of its students
behind one basket, but follows the routine

.of placing the benches and scorer’s table at

the top of the screen.

. Steve Kirschner, the senior associate ath:

leticvdirector for communications at UNC,
said seating students has challenged the
Smith Center for years.

“The Smith Center was built with en?
tirely private funding, so the seats behind
the _benches aregiven to the people who

funded the place,” Kirschner said. “‘We le- V
gally and physically cannot move students

much closer.” '

, Only about 400 students can ﬁt on risers
placed behind one basket, but the number
of student tickets sold at North Carolina

varies based on the importance of each

game. Against Duke, its biggest rival, 6,000 .

student tickets are reserved, but against
other opponents, that number is several
thousand fewer. The overﬂow of students
is then spread around the lower bowl or
placed in higher—level seating.

Kirschner says it yields the most com—
plaints from students,_which has led to fre-
quent attempts to improve student seating.

“[Like Pitt], our cameras face the two
team benches and scorer’s table, and the
seats behind them are not students,”’ he
said. “Every few years there is a push from
students to put students around the court,
but the people who built the building have
a right to those seats, sowe cannot.”

For some students, the nontraditional
seating setup is an advantage.

At Notre Dame’s Joyce Center, the stu-

L dents all stand behind one basket near the

opposing bench, and as a result do not get
much television exposure. But Senior As-
sociate Athletics Directorjohn Heisler said
the students love it this way. - .
“There was more of an interest in having
the students closer to the visiting bench,”
Heisler said. “Wefeel this creates a more

hostile environment. The student section
has not changed since the arena" opened in
1968, so there’s a little tradition involved,
as well.” ' '

While the student section has not moved
for years at Notre Dame, the benches have.
When thejoyce Center was originally built,
the benches were located on the same side

. as the cameras, unlike many other schools.

“A few years back, we hosted some NCAA

Tournament games, and the TV station »

wanted us to move the benches to the op-
posite side as the camera,” Heisler said. “We
ended up leaving them that way ever since.”

In addition to the student section, Pitt
has also received complaints about its capac-
it}: The Petersen Events Center seats 12,508
people, but some, like Brenner, say there are
simple ways to increase its capacity.

A horizontal line of championship ban-
ners hangs from a wall high above one bas-
ket, but at most arenas, these banners hang
from rafters. As a result, the banners at Pitt
occupy space that could otherwise be used
to add several hundred more seats.

50 banners that honor players and cham-

alongsidevideo ‘boards that also hang in
corners of the arena. A ’

At Notre Dafne’s Joyce Center, the bang-

ners hang from rafters, as well. Heisler said
the arena did undergo one change, which
involved switching its upper seats to chair;
backs and removing 'blea_cher seating. This

reduced the Joyce Center.’s capacity from’ '

11,000 to 9,000.-

Hotchkiss said having all chairbacks
and a lower capacity actually beneﬁts Pitt,
though, because it raises the value of seats.

“From a money standpoint, we want to

have demand,” hesaid. “Only about 20 or so '
schools sell out basketball tickets regularly, '
A and we are one of them. Because the demand

is so highfor season tickets, wecan basically
do whatever we wantwith seat licenses and

—— several thousand fewer than the Petersen

A‘ “It is much, much hotter in Cameron,

and not in great shape as a facility,” said
Hotchkiss, who worked as the assistant
sports information director at Duke from
1999-2000. “It’s abad arena, but nobody
notices because of its history and the Cra-
zies [student section].'It’s got such a great

So while the Pete has problems ofits own,
Hotchkiss says that sacriﬁces in capacity
and Zoo visibility must be made for other
b_eneﬁts.' _ .

“We could probably make another
$500,000 a year selling Zoo_ tickets to the

public, but the students are the priority,” he .

said. “The Pete is probably  the top 10 in
the country as far as basketball facilities go.
Trust me, I’ve been to most of them.” |
