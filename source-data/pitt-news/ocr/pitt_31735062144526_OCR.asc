Succumbs;

Chem Prof Well-Lilted

Kendall Siebert Tesh, Pitt chem-

. istry professor, died of a heart at-

tack in. his ofﬁce on Wednesday,
August 9th. The attack was en-
tirely unexpected, for Professor
Tesh, who was working at his desk,
was about to give an examination
to one of his classes. Students said
he appeared healthy immediate-
ly before his death, although for
several days he had been com-
plaining of pains in his chest.

In the fall of 1944, Professor
Tesh would have completed twen-

Penn State Department Head
Guest At Speech Party Here

Professor John F. Frizzell, dis-
tinguished head of the depart-
ment of speech at Pennsylvania
State college, will be the guest of
honor at the Women’s Speech-
Men’s Debate party to be given
this Thursday evening in Stephen
Foster memorial.

Professor Frizzell was an in-
structor-in English at Penn State
from 1902 until 1920, when he
left to take the position o.f ’prin-
cipal at the High School for Boys
in Reading, Pennsylvania. Then,
in 1926,, he -returned to Pennsyl-
vania State college as associate
professor of public speaking. It
was in this Capacity that he or-

fganized Penn State’s department
lof speech, “which in the period
5 since has been brought from al-
,most nothing to a nationally re-
spected and recognized depart-
lment.”

As a student in both high school

‘and college, Professor Frizzell was

always interested in public speak-
and this interest has been
sustained through the years he
has spent in education. He is one
of the founders of the Eastern

Public Speaking conference, “the
oldest and one of the most effec-
tive speech organizations in
America,” and is now its presi-
dent.

versity. He began teaching as an
assistant while still a senior in
1917. In 1918, he received the
bachelor of science degree from
the University of Pittsburgh, the
master of science in 1921, and in
1924, the doctor of philosophy.
While an undergraduate, Kendall
Tesh earned his education as see-
retary in the chemistry depart-
ment. During World ‘War 1, he
served as a second lieutenant at
Camp Suster, Michigan and Camp
Zachary Taylor, Kentucky. Upon
returning to Pitt in 1919, he ob-
tained an instructorship. He be-
‘came assistant professor in 1926
and in 1928, was made professor
and head of the Uniontown cen-
ter of the University. Professor
Tesh transferred to the headship
of the Johnstown center when the
Uniontown center was closed in
1933. He returned to Pitt as a
professor of chemistry in 1936 and
remained here until his recent
death.

Dr. Tesh is survived by his wife,
Flora Hitzfelt Tesh; a brother, in
Wilmington, Robert Tesh; a sister
in Erie, Mrs. A. H. Croup; and an-
other sister, Miss Sara C. Tesh, a
Pittsburgh public school teacher.

Regretting his untimely death
along with Dr. Tesh’s family, col-
leagues, and older friends is a
host of friends in the Pitt student
body.

Private Killed in Action

Pvt. Wilbert Moretsky, who
prior to his enlistment in the
Army on June 24, 1943, was a
bacteriology major at Pitt, has
been reported killed in action in
France. Pvt. Moretsky who had
been enrolled here in February,
1942, had been serving with a
medical detachment of the infan-
try unit until his death on Sep-

tember 20, 1944.

It’s a big election year, and tliroughout the country there
is one inevitable topic of conversation—Roosevelt or Dewey?
Streetcars and bars are breeding places for extemporaneous
stump speakers. There seems to be something about the sway-
ing motion of strap hanging and the swimming eﬁect of a “tall
one” that fosters deep political thought. Soft leather chairs in
private clubs also promote that chummy feeling that comes with
planning international strategy. But both of these settings,
while conducive to political gab, have their drawbacks: if in
streetcars, the riders are too strange, the clubs hit the other ex-
treme in that all the members tend to follow the same sheep.

The ideal atmosphere for political discussion is a spot where
the people know each other well enough to express themselves
freely and yet are sufﬁciently diverse in background and interest
to take vastly diﬁerent sides of the same issue. Here at Pitt
there are two almost perfect examples of such an atmosphere--—
those two beehives of intellectual and social activity, the Faculty
club and the Tuck Shop.

With less than a month till election day, political discussion
and expression has already reached a high pitch. At least, if
the campaign buttons and pamphlets, the hot discussions and
careful bets are any indication. Because of this great interest
and because of the importance of this war—year election, the Pitt
News has decided to run its Gallup poll, in an eﬂort to de-
termine political feeling at the University.

We are asking every student, faculty member, adminis-
trator, and all military personnel to clip and ﬁll out the ballot

at .the bottom of this page. Poll boxes will be placed on the
ground floor of the Cathedral, in Thaw, State, and Alumni halls,
in old Mellon institute, and at the Dental clinic to receive the
ballots. The votes will then be collected, compiled, and the re-
sults published in next week’s issue.

. The outcome of the poll should prove very interesting. So,

REALLY?

   

 

By Lee Mclnerny

For a long time, the Independ-
ent association has been a sub-
ject of great interest and contro-

versy here at Pitt. It is also
a rather delicate one to write
about, for someone is bound to
think I haven't given an unbiased
opinion of it. Nevertheless, since
some of the Independents tell me
they intend to carry on their pro-
gram this year, I feel a general
picture ought to be presented to
the student body.

The situation as it stands now
is that the Independent members
all have different ideas about
their coming program. Some of
them want more representation
in student government and activi-
ties; others insist, Jerry Stern,
for one, that they want to build
up the “Independent soci-ety on
campus into a social group, offer-
ing independents many of the ad-
vantages of a fraternity.” Politics,
as he put it, are out.

the Independent associatioin does
not, by any means, represent

every non-fraternity man and
woman on campus. It is a small
group and, at the time, is disor-
ganized. Foremost members with
whom I have talked have frankly
admitted that unless the coming
meeting, which ha-s only been ten-
tatively planned, helps to pro-
mote some system of unity, they
hope for nothing. They need cap-
able leaders; they need coopera-
tion—two things they don’t feel
that they have now. Ever since
1941, when the army draft-ed most
of their leaders, the Independ-
ents have been very sadly disor-
ganized. And that is th-eir opinion,
not mine.

So, according to the present, if
somewhat confused attitude o.f the
Independents, they intend to be-
come a deﬁnite social, non-politi-
cal group on campus this year. I
think with the proper leadership,
they can -do it,

ﬂettezu to
‘7/ze Zcldaa

I am one of the ex-Gls return-
ing to school after a rather pro-
longed absence. I attended Pitt
during ’39 and ’39, and although

I never thought after dropping out
that I would be returning to the
University, the recently-enacted
GI Bill of Rights has made that
very thing possible. Due to slight-
ly more than a year’s service with
the Army Air Corps, I ﬁnd my-
self back on campus again.

I guess we veterans felt a little
strange at ﬁrst, due to the disap-
pearance of our old crowd, long
since graduated, and our constant
amazement at the changes which
have occurred during our absence.
Everyone has been so friendly and
cooperative though, that I for one

have really acquired that “at
home” feeling once more. There
are so many changes; oﬂices

moved, new tuck shops, new ﬂoors
ﬁnished, so many more nationality
rooms completed, no more “foot-

tors, no band at the football games,
the new red and white uniforms
of the grid warriors themselves,
old familiar faculty faces missing
and new ones in their places, yet
it is still basically the same old
Pitt I knew before. The funda-
mental qualities of life at Pitt are
as unchanging as the Commons
Room itself, which still looks ex-
actly the same as it did half a
decade ago. The coeds are still
the prettiest in Pittsburgh too, and
one has only to walk along one of
the corridors to see the “Passing
Pageant of Pitt Pulchritude” go-
ing on as ever. These are my
random impressions on my return’
to Pitt, and incidentaly if I didn’t
say so before, it’s swell to be
back. .

1%; Speech Instructor Thinks
“Pittsburghers Are So Nice”

By Tillie Sanker

“Something new” in the speech department this semester is Miss
Virginia Cox. She comes to us from Larchmont, N. Y.

Miss Cox has only been in Pittsburgh since August but in that
short time she has come to like our “Smokey City” tremendously. She
thinks “the people are so nice here” and says, “The people here in

Pittsburgh take time to be courteous.
of New York. Oh, but don’t think:

There is not that rush! rush!

I don’t like New York. I do-—but
I like to relax, as you all seem to
do in Pittsburgh.”

She is a graduate of the College
of New Rochelle and the Teach-
ers’ College of Columbia Univer-
sity. Greatly interested in dra-
matics and journalism, Miss Cox
directed plays and worked on the
local paper while going to school.
Before coming to Pitt she taught
school in Stanford, N. Y. Here
this demure young lady teaches
public speaking, and voice and
diction.

Speech correction is her main
interest. She does not desire to
make all her students into actress-
es. Quite to the contrary, she
heartily dislikes affectation. She
wants her students to be sincere

and honest, without affectation.

Asked if she liked sports, Miss
Cox said, “I’m crazy about them,
especially horseback-riding and
swimming.” She also plays bad-
rninton, table tennis, and golf.

But most of all she likes people
and enjoys being with them.

When it happens that she is
alone her active heart won’t al-
‘low her to just ‘sit and do noth-
ing.’ She has sat for hours read-
ing, poetry in preference to prose.
Edna St. Vincent, Carl Sandburg,
and other present day writers are
among her favorites.

This youthful instructor laughs
at the old ideas of the prim

“school marm,” and wants whole-
heartedly to be just an ordinary
person, who loves fun and excite-
ment—-just one of us at Pitt.

Mica’s special insulating qualities are mighty important in

communications equipment. No equivalent exists, so war’s

huge demands caused a critical shortage.

Bell Telephone Laboratories’ scientists were assigned the

task of somehow ﬁnding more mica. They found it-—in the

very considerable amounts of raw mica which visual inspec-

tion had rejected. By developing electrical apparatus to test

the two most important electrical properties, they increased

the usable amount of mica by half and so stretched current

supplies of mica to ﬁll all military needs.

In many such ways the Bell System is serving the nation,

constantly meeting the needs of our ﬁghting forces for

dependable communications.

Pitt Vets Meet
At Smoker

World War II veterans, who
entered the undergraduate schools
of the University this semester,
were guests of the Pitt Veterans
club at a smoker and get acquaint-
ed meeting last Friday afternoon,
in the social room of Foster me-
morial. The event marked the
opening of a broadened program
of activities that is being planned
by the club.

President Larry Bogart, BA,
welcomed the veterans and an-
nounced the rules applying to
eligibility for membership in the
club. He stressed the purposes
of the club, namely: to help
orient returning «servicemen and
women to college life, to aid the
University in furthering the war
effort, and to provide a means of
bringing Pitt veterans together so-
cially.

Dr. W. G. Crouch of the Eng-
lish department told of his hum-
orous experiences with veterans
of the last war when he was a
student at Pitt. He also read an-d
interpreted excerpts from the
Broadway comedy of army life,
Over 21, by Ruth Gordon. Vet-
eran Dick Briney, professional en-
tertainer and comedy star of a
number of Pitt musicals before he
entered the service, closed the
program with his burlesque of the
reading of “the ﬁnancial report.”

After the program, refreshments
were served, and Mr. Theodore W.
Biddle, dean of men and advisor
for the veterans group, was on
hand to chat informally with the
vets.

YM Initiates
Member Drive

A drive to enroll all students as
members of the YMCA at Pitt will
be the goal of this year’s member-
ship campaign which will begin
during the week of October 23, it
was announced by Leonard Shorr,
chairman of the campaign.

Students are urged to join as
the Y plans of their most active
programs. One of the present ac-
tive groups is the Freshman club,
in which a series of discussions
are held, led by the more popular
faculty members and students,
who try to acquaint freshman
with college life. The Pre-M-ed
forum which has been one of
the most popular programs aims
to familiarize students interested
in medicine by conducting tours
to hospitals, witnessing hospital
operations, lectures by prominent
medi-cal ﬁgures and showing the
latest ﬁlms in medical science. The
newest discussion group is the
Upperclass club which discusses
anything from {public improve-
ment to international and domes-
tic problems.

“The scope of the YMCA” cit-
ed Leonard Shor, “is unlimited.
Many students have had little or
no experience in working in such
organization as the Y. The Y at
Pitt needs these students for they
possibly have some good ideas
which may be overlooked. The Y
wants their ideas and efforts to
make the Y what it should be for
the college student.”

Although the campaign is not
yet under way, application will
still be taken at the YMCA office
on the 8th ﬂoor.

One-Time Telegraph Operator

Now Pitt Finance Professor

By Lee Mclnerney

“President McKinley assasinated!

President shot!”

The words that rung out on the streets of Wisconsin had ﬁrst been
read in one town by an eleven year-old telegraph operator who is
now your professor of ﬁnance, Montfort Jones, a tall, husky, beaming

man who always looks vague when asked the color of his eyes.

He

doesn’t know; -he “never looked at them.”
The reason he’s your professor now (and this might surprise you)

is that he was only average in¢

penmanship years back. That Mr.
Jones admits, needs some ex-
planation. Once he had the chance
to become a train dispatch man,
and it was a very good one until
it was discovered he could not
write ﬂuently, clearly, quickly, as
is done in all the best movies. “I
could only write legibly,’ sighed
Mr. Jones". “After that disap-
pointment, I decided to go to col-
lege.”

.He graduated from Wisconsin,
did some teaching and graduate
work there, then came to Pitt in
.1915. He has been here ever since.

He likes Pittsburgh, the soot and
‘the dirt,

the trains that churn
through East Liberty station. Oh,
especially the trains!

“Deﬁnitely. I have railroad
blood in me,” he laughed. “Even
yet, I watch trains’ go by, stand-
ing on bridges while they pass un-
der me. When I have nothing to
do, I often go down to the station
and watch them come in.” He
swerved in his chair. “Fascinat-
ing, just fascinating.”

When asked if he had any un-
usual experience as a telegraph
‘operator. Mr. Jone’s mouth wid-
ened into a smile. “Yes, I had
quite a few. There was almost a
train wreck . . ” He broke off
suddenly, and smiled again. “Ah,
yes, I had quite a few.” ‘

As for the Pitt students he has
had in the past 29 years, he shakes

.h_is head wonderingly and says

with gusto that they’ve “certainly
been an interesting cross-section.”

and there were students, accord-
ing to Mr. Jones.

After this remark, he peered
hopefully over his glasses.

Teasing, he said, “Of course,
none of this is going to be print-
ed‘),

At least, it is hoped it was said
teasingly!

“Y” Goes to Conference

Representative to a YWCA con-
ference for ﬁve middle Atlantic
states this year was Illeana Hutch-
inson, C, member of the YWCA
cabinet. The conference, to which
Miss Hutchinson was elected in
June, was staged in Philadelphia,
October 7 and 8, for the purpose of
promoting the youth student Chris-
tian movement. As a member of
the policymaking group, she helped
plan for the coming year with gen-
eral emphasis upon a program of
intercollegiate associations.

IF Council Meets
To Set Activities

The ﬁrst meeting of the Inter-
fraternity council took place at
the Pi Kappa Alpha house on
Tuesday, October 3.

Following a suggestion by Mr.
Brittain, assistant to the dean of
men, the council decided that each
fraternity should appoint a rep-
resentative to lead a Friday chapel
service. The date for the ﬁrst of
these programs has not yet been
set.

The Inter—fraternity dance was
also discussed. Council did not
decide whether the dance is to be
formal, semi-formal, or informal
because most of the fraternities
have not brought up the subject
of dress at their chapter meetings
yet. It was decided, however, that
the dance is to be closed to fra-
ternity men in school now, those
fraternity men returned from
service, and alumni. George
Smith, C, president of Inter-fra-
ternity council, appointed John
Gallagher, BA, social chairman.
Council suggested that he secure
a name band or semi-name band
for the dance.

Quote from college students all
over the country.
If money talks as most folks tell,
To most of us it says, “Farewell.”

0am aéle/re--0am 7/re;-e——

Greetings from Pitt service peo-
ple over here and over there. In
spite of the difﬁculties and hard-
ships our former class mates have
gone and are going through, they
still take time to write the kind
of letters we love to get.

1st Lt. Ben Foote who is over-
seas with a New York APO, writes
that his outﬁt makes daily trips to
pound the enemy’s line of com-
munication. He says, “I’m getting
so used to the English channel
and the point where we always
make landings on the Dutch coast
that‘s it’s getting almost as much
of a habit as the Monongahela
used to be on the drive from Wil-
kinsburg down the Blvd of the
Allies.”

The ﬁrst American officer to be
on leave in Paris was Pitt’s Lt.
Jack Hoeveler. He hitchhicked in-
to the city and as luck would have
it, was with the -ﬁrst American
troops to enter. Jack writes about
the experience, “I came in with
a major in his jeep and rode the
glory road from Versailles to the
Arc de Triumph. We were the
ﬁrst Americans the French had
seen since the city was actually
taken by the French. We were
stopped all the way by hysteric-
ally happy people who swarmed

all over us, kissing us, cheering
and yelling “Welcome,” “Vive
L’Amerique,” applauding, crying.
We received the brunt‘? of four
years of pent up enthusiasm.”

Capt. D. J. Bailey who had an
enjoyable pass at Capri, a little
while back, describes it, saying,
“What a paradise! I’ve never seen
anything like it.” In general,
though, the Italian -climate is kind
of warm. The heat is so close and
sticky it just saps the ~ strength
and ambition right out of you.”

From Gulfport, Miss. Dave Bar-
bour writes, “The Navy istrying
to make a radio technician out of
men. Their methods are quite dif-
ferent from Pitt’s, particularly the
part about supervised night study.
We go and study, or else!” ,

A letter from Bob Page tells us
us that he has traveled 23,000 sea
miles to date. While in Africa, he
lived in absolute luxury. Bob /‘says
he visited a home which reminded
him of the ‘Syria-Lebanon room at
Pitt.

Women students are again re-
minded that the second floor
washroom and smoking room are
open for use. These rooms should
be used so that there may be less
conjestion on the ground floor.

’allons, Pitties, hope you’re feeling
tip-top

If you ain’t, come to the Howdy
Hop.

Poetic license for the above
atrocity is held by Phyl Krieger

opponent) the co-chairmen of the
Howdy Hop that’s being held Oct.
14. For a real composition in
verse, see the end of this column.

Notes from a frayed Psi O
house: During one of their intel-
lectual and fraternal bull sessions
someone mentioned that at one
time Mr. Heinz would have liked
to ﬁnance the Cathedral of Learn-
ing-—at which bright-eyed Gene
O’Donovan piped up, “Heinz
missed out on accounta he wanted
it built in the shape of a pickle!”

Speaking of -Psi Os, Garnet Mc-
Marlin has been dating one by the
name of Jack Lazadur. Her frat
sister, Helen Herman, besides get-
ting the rush from at least two
Pitt men that I can think of on the
spur of the moment, is also dating
the biggest hunk of man (a la
Westminster College) that I’ve
seen in many a day.

Latest campus puzzles are the
new Bill Humes-Jean Walther
deal and why the Fijis ﬁnally had
to get rid of their dog. Some say
the latter is because Reppert
didn’t put him through the proper
training course.

M. C. Dom, new freshman girl
and as pretty as a picture, seems
to have become a Delta dream gal
already.

Two latest furlough dates at the
Tri Delt house were Paul Fischer,
who made Pat Williams happy,
and Johnnie Jenkins, former PiKA,
who made everybody happy.

Latest Delt pin to go into cir-
culation was Jack Garnham’s-—-
the new owner is TPA Rita Lacey.

Chi 0 Nancy Jean Yant has the
Kappa Sig pin of an Army man,
but Audrey Bishop canceled out
the progress by returning a Theta
Chi pin.

Nancy McLa.ug1in’s man, Bud
Bell, who was reported missing in
action twice, is now safely home
on furlough and has received the
Purple Heart award.

Lola. Ward has ﬁnally settled
down to one man, she tells us, and
the one man is Bernie Cabetta of
med school. I'm closing now with

and Dick Barnhart

Attention faithful r-ead-ers—both
of you! The Howdy Hop, the ﬁrst
school dance of the year, the ﬁrst
since Spring Festival ’way back
last May, is coming up on Satur-
day night. This is the chance for
all you new freshmen to get start-
ed off right at Pitt. And you ad-
vanced freshmen, too. You haven’t
been to a dance here yet. Of
course the sophomores, juniors,
and seniors kn-ow how terriﬁc Pitt
dances are, and they’ll all be on
hand. It’s a good chance to see
all your old friends and to make
some new ones. The Urban room
on the seventennth ﬂoor of the
William Penn is the place, nine
to twelve the time, and Bill Le-
Roy’s orchestra provides the mu-
sic. So . . . we’ll see you at the
Howdy Hop on Saturday night.

Now -on with the dirt.

Smooth J. Matthews Smith, that
great Pittsburgh actor, outstand-
ing basketball star, talent author,
snappy song-and.-dance man, ra-
dio station operator, expert truck
driver, foremost floor scrubber,
smoke-ring blower extraordinary,
and who knows what else( what
else is there?) . but to get
away from this paid political ad-
vertisement and back to the sub-
ject, Smith, etc., has been swept
into the gay, mad social whirl
centerin gabout the Tri-Delts. A
side line is the ‘Tech dramats.
Wasting no time at Pitt, no
at all! . V

Q'uesti~on of the week depart»
ment: This concerns another
Smith. He’s being cagey about it,
but has George Smith parted with

his pin? T‘hat’s absolutely all we '

could get on the subject; you can
work. on it from there.

This week’s comment on the

ﬂamboyant advertising at the foot-
ball game on Saturday is from the
little boy who sells peanuts. “The
Sigma Chees are better than the
Pikahs, ain’t they?” And after all
that hard work, too.
Will John’s mother’s other leg
have to be amputated. because of
the kiddie-car collision at Bigelow
and Fifth? Should Mamie Schmaltz
continue her career or try to be a
real mother to her three deform-
ed children‘? Find out next week,

snappy songs -and stupid sayings.

Pitt"s successive string of three
straight victories over the Army
Cadets will in all probability take
a turn for the worse this coming
Saturday. Dating back to 1931
when Pitt trampled Army, 26-0,
then 18-13 in 1932 and ﬁnally
29-6 in 1935 there was a lapse of
eight years before the two teams
«were destin-ed to meet this year,
but under more favorable condi-
tions for Army.

All signs point to Army’s ﬁrst
victory over ‘the Golden Panthers.
The Cadets can boast of having
one of the top ranking backfields
in the country with such star stud-
ded names as Davis, Dobbs, Hall,

.K-enna, Lombardo, and Minor

along with other well known
names. With Army’s crop of stars
they are being lauded as the best
team in the East or in the land
this year.

The Jungle Cats have displayed
their talent three times at the
Stadium, twice coming out on top
against two weaker teams and
the other time losing to powerful
Notre Dame. When the boys from
Skyscraper U trod out onto the
turf of Michie Stadium, home
grounds -of Army, they may well
be sensing another Notre Dame
rout but this time at the hands of
the Cadets.

Last week Army humiliated
Brown 512-7‘ and the week before

  

_ made quick work of North Caro-
Alina 46-10.

With their present
string or two victories the West
Pointers can well add the riddled
Panthers to their victims by at
least four touchdowns, and send
the Panthers home only to pre-
pare for Illinois.

Lieutenant Col. Earl H. “Red”
Blaik, head coach of West Point,
will not take the Panthers too
light, but can be sure of an Army
victory unless the Jungle Cats can
do the unbelievable by making
the headlines in upsetting Army.

Last year the Cadets under
“Red” Blaik played a 10 game
schedule, winning seven, losing
two, -and t-ieing one. With a better
crop of players and more experi-
ence the Soldiers look like an
unstoppable ‘steamroller and do
not intend to leave anything stand
in their way, including Pitt.

Shaughnessy from this game on
is up against the stiffest compe-
tition that can be thrown his way.
Shaughnessy’s only defense on up-
setting Army will be to stop their
“T” formation from functioning.
If the Panthers can play ball as
they did in the opening minutes
of play against Notre Dam-e, they
may be able to do the impossible
but with Army’s top ranking gack-
eld plus a hard charging line it
seems that Pitt will have to go a
long ways to trounce their oppo-
nents.

Dairy Products

Army is counting much upon
Glenn Davis, Robert Dobbs, Tom
Lombardo, Max Minor, and Dale
Hall to carry the burden against
Pitt. With a strong line in front
of them the Army eleven looks
like an All-American team.

Army has participated in 457
games since they took to the grid-
iron and 310 of these games have
ended in victory for the Cadets
against 115 losses and 32 ties, a
percentage of .678. The boys from
Army are looking forward to
changing the win column from
310 to 311 after they meet Pitt.

Clark Shaughnessy’s Jungle
Cats are in good shape for the
coming game. Jack Itzel will
probably be back at the fullback
after being out of the Pitt-Beth-
any game beoause of an injured
leg. Fran Mattioli who was hurt
and taken out of the Bethany
game is also expected to be in
playing condition by Saturday.
Otherwise Pitt is in good physical
shape and is headed for a rough
road and a not too bright day
when they match “T” against “T”
at West Pointagainst the heavy
favored Army team which hopes
to change Pitt’s unblemished rec-
6rd of three straight victories.

First Lesson

Last Tuesday marked the open-
ing day of practice for Dr. H. C.
Car1son’s ﬂoor squad and if at-
tendance counts it looks like a
great season for the Panthers.
Thirty-ﬁve boys turned out for
the ﬁrst session and the doctor is
out to -choose the boys that really
are interested in the game and not
those that want to make an im-
pression on their be-st girl.

This season Dr. Carlson has di-
vided his boys into two classes:
those with mercenary motives and
out for personal gains and the
second group are the boys who go
all out to win by giving their best
to the proposition at hand. The
former group of boys are the ones
the doctor aims to keep off his
squad and feels that in the matter
of time the going will get so tough

Pall IF Sports
Program Slated

Autumn is here! Football spirit
is again in the air! Gay colors are
seen and loud cheers are heard
echoing throughout many sta-
diums. At ‘Pitt we have no color, we
have no‘ band, but we do have in-
ter-fraternity sports. These sports
tend to make up for the fact that
Pitt is no longer dominant in col-
legiate athletics. At present the
fraternities will engage in a
touch-football league. The games
will start promptly at 5 o’-clock on
the Trees ﬁeld. Those fraternities
entering are the Phi Eps, the Delts,
the Phi Delts, the Sigma Chis, the
Pi Lambs, the SAEs, the Phi
-Gams, and the PiKAs. Pre—s-ea-
son dope has the Phi Gams and
the PiKAs as heavy favorites
with the Phi Eps as a potential
darkhorse. Competition this sea-
son should be very tough since it
is the ﬁrst time in many years that
the Phi -Gams are trailing in the
race for the all-point trophy. Your
“news reporter” will have a brief
summary of all league games,
picking out the outstanding player
from each fraternity and giving
hi mthe credit that he rightly de-
serves. The rules for the league
games are: each team will be com-
posed of six men, three backs and
three linemen; everyone will be
eligible to catch a pass; games
will last one hour; officials will be
supplied by the athletic depart-

ment; free substitutions are per-

mitted so that everyone will have
a; chance to play. A new rule just
recently established is that at the
end of each game the captain of
the winning team must report the
score of Ray Reppert, C, athletic
chairman, or the game will have
to be played over. This rule will

,  carried out to the ‘fullest ex-

tent and no excuses will be ac-
ceepted if the captain fails to re-
port. the score. Here’s wishing all
the ‘fraternities a su-ccessful sea-
son.

By Sandy Lamp!

The immense bowl at the head of Bouquet street, commonly
called Pittt Stadium, will be empty Saturday as our exponents

of the “T” formation travel to West Point, N. Y., to meet an- ’

other team which utilizes the same system, Army. Although
Pitt’s head mentor, Clark Shaughnessy, has the title of the
“Master of the ‘T’,” this game more than likely will be an ex-
ample of the student besting the teacher.

Pitt will be up against the reputed strongest college team in
the country when they meet Coach Earl Blaik’s cadets. Army ’s
backﬁeld is truly a coaches dream . . . speed, power, and ver-
satility. Not only is the ﬁrst string backﬁeld touchdown auto-
matans, but Coach Blaik is two or three deep in every position
with capable performers. An example is Dean Sensan-
baugher, a reserve back, who last year was playing for Ohio
State. Pitt students will remember how this speedy back helped
run roughshod over the ’43 Panthers. He was as good as any
Pitt back on the ﬁeld on that fateful day . . . and yet this season
he is only used in a reserve role by Blaik.

Though there hasn’t been much publicity given to the Cadet
forward wall, it is to be taken as a supposition that the Army
line will be a tough block of granite for the red and white backs
to try and crack. For Army has come up, year in and year out,
with one of the strongest defensive teams in the land, and this
team is no exception. In their two contests so far the Cadets
have only allowed one touchdown, '

It might be that Bethany was weaker than expected, or
again it may be that the Pittoffensive thrust has found itself
and desired revenge for their merciless beating at the hands of
the Irish. Against Army Pitt will reveal what the other teams
and the student body should expect for the remainder of the
season. It is doubtful that Pitt will win, yet if they ﬁght from
the opening kickoff to the closing gun and put up a still battle
their followers will be well satisﬁed.

Although there was marked improvement in the play of the
Panther, the weak link is still their pass defense. Through this
medium Notre Dame rolled up their astronomical total of 58
points. Due to Pitt’s weak aerial stop~gap Mocha completed a
good many of his attempts, Bethany’s total number of comple-
tions being eleven forwards which were good for 228 yards.

On the other side of the ledger, it is to be said for Pitt’s
credit that their own passing offensive has been smoothed out
and should cause Mr. Blaik and company some anxiety. The
two best tossers on the team are southpaw Joe Kielb and Paul
Rickards. Last week with Kielb at the quarterback slot and

Rickards shifting over to one of the halfback positions we had

the advantage of two capable passers.

Still a black mark on Pitt’s~record is their opponents the
Panthers have been set back 382 yards due to infractions of the
rules. True, some of their penalties have been due to overcager-
ness on the part of the forward wall, yet too many have been
for rushing the kicker, clipping, holding and just plain un-
necessary roughness.

Bethany’s ﬁrst six pointer was the initial time that a team
from Bethany, West Virginia, has scored on Pitt in-the long
series of games which began in 1899. To add insult to injury
it was a former Pitt gridder that was the impetus in the Bethany
scoring spark, Joe Mocha. Mocha certainly played a big factor

in both of the visitors scores, and he was Mr. Big for the vis- A

itors. If Coach Shaughnessy had Mocha back this season to toss
the aerials, Pitt would be a power to beat.
The downtown papers seemed to relish the fact that Pitt

let Bethany score, but neither the team nor the -coaches seemed A

to be exactly depressed about Bethany’s two markers. For they

know what it is, to be hopelessly beaten and yet not score them-
self.
