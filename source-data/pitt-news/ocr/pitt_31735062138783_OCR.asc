CAP AND GowNf PLAY _ -

Great»Preparations Are Being Made
for the Coming Year—Wasson
and McCormick on the Job.

 

Energetic_-preparations are being
°;nade by the Cap and Gown Club for
The outlook is
bright and a very successful season
is anticipated.

The play decided upon for this year
is entitled “The Captain of the
Gliard,” and is the creation of W.
Chesney Benson of the sophomore
class. Critics pronounce it a clever
work, bearing the earmarks‘ of a suc-

,’ Vcessful comedy.

President Wasson states that the
“Big Show,” or homeprogluction of
the play, will be put on at the Mxon
Theater sometime before Easter. ‘This
is somewhat earlier than usual and
willbe ahead of the other amateur
productions in this city. Manager S.
B. McCormick, _'Ir., is arranging for .a
preliminary production in a nearby‘
town in order to try the play out.

Heretofore the V productions have
been confined to Pittsburgh and the
smaller towns of this vicinity, but the
time has now cbme for a broadening
of th-e ﬁeld. President Wasson, with
his three years’ experience in this line,
is an excellent man to pilot the club
successfully through this year of ex-
pansion.‘ ‘

The club has now -put on ﬁve very
creditable shows and is suﬂiciently ex-
‘-perienced to_ perform in the larger
cities with credit both to themselves
and to the University. The managers

Prof. Sheldon Speaks.
" at Weekly Assembly

 

At the weeklyconvocation in Me-
morial Hall, ‘last Friday morning, the
banquet’ room _was again comfortably
ﬁlled. ‘An opening hymn was ‘sung,
Chancellor McCormick led ‘in, prayer,
and several important announcements
were made, after which a few minutes

were spent in singing college songs, '

under -the leadership of Wagner, ’l4.

The add’res.s of the hour was made
by Prof. I-I.'D. Sheldon of the School
of Educatioin, on “Some Aspects of
Contemporary European Education.”
He spokeiofithe severity ‘of German
gymnasiums, contrasting it with the
la‘xity of our own schools, and show-
ing that American schoolboys have
many things to be thankful for.
Among the interesting features 0
German university life are duelling, a
general.fr‘eedom among the students,
and the scientific and intellectual at-
mosphere which vpervades them, re-
sul 'ng in a much broader and more
general culture among the: educated

H.

classes of Germany, than is‘ common \_

among American college r_nen.
“English education,” ‘Prof. Sheldon
said, “is characterized by a great. rev-
ﬁerence for everything’ that is old and
traditional. On the English universi-
tieis, athletics are participated in by
almostithe entire student body, and

a corresponding spirit is shown in‘

the other activities.”

Prof. Sheldon ended with a refer-
ence to the broad, democracy of our
own University. A

THE CI:-IATTER BOX

 

Andrnow, after‘ all those years of
preparatory Work, you have arrived.
You had deposited your family rec-
ords and those of your Revolutionary
anc_estor in the archives presided
over by Dr. Frost; youhave been

welcomed by the Chancellor and the ,

members of the faculty; you have
been sized up by the keen and eager

Sophom0res—why should we go on? ,

All this goes to indicate that you are
now a Pitt man and a full “blooded
one, we hope and pray. ‘
It might be of interest to ask you
why you have come to Pitt. The
University is anxious ‘to know
whether its students come because of
the standing of the University, its

:faculty, its alumni or the friendships

in st}.1dent»life it offers. We will pass
that by. What we do want to know
is what you are going to do while
here? P -

Yes, we know that the ﬁrst thing’

you want to do is to kill a few

i“Sophs” and W-e commend you for

the same. It -is good‘tha_t your young

blood tingles with'a desire to elim-

inate the ancient fo-e of all good
Freshmen. It is a sign  energy
that is in you, of your -’ ty to fall

  

in line, ofyour youth—you~r blessed,

youth. Thoseare all qualities that
we want you to keep. Try them out
on the “Sophs” that you may know
that those good things are within you.

Good, that is good! And you want
to play some football? Great! Sure-
ly we want you to do all those things
and if Pitt don’t give you the oppor-
tunity-——a great big opportunity, too
—kicl<, kick, until you get it!

There are a great many other

things you want to do, we know. We- a

will talk of them again. There  one
other thingiwe want to say before we
release your hand from this ‘first
greeting. Beyond all other consider-
ations you have come here to store
your mind’ with the experiences of the
race, to lea-rn methods,of ﬁrocedure-—
William James would call tlhem
“habits”,-—to learn above all how- to
think——to think corre_ctly—~that you
may know the way in which to value
the various elements of life. There

is one word that is the key to all of’

this—work, Are you ready to work?
We trust you are ‘so that when the
four short years upon which you are
entering have come to a close you
can say with R. L. S., “I know what
pleasure is for I have done good
work.” -

MORE CHEERING

One of the lamentable features of
the football games that have been
played this season is the lack of good
cheering at the «games. Even when
the team hasrbeen winning the cheer-
inegihas not been up to the standard
that it ought‘ to,,be, and when the
team was on a slump they ave re-
ceived very little support from the
stpdents in the stands and in the
cheering section. A Thishstate of af-

_ fairs ought to be remedied at once.

The team needs the“ support of every,
member of thestudent body, .‘and no

"matter ‘how far ahead the other team
may be, "_Pitt’sl rooters should not fall

down for one rnﬁiute in the matter of

Several very'g0od mass meetings

,have been held this week, at which

meetings the songs andveheers of the
University have _ been. rehearsed in
preparation for the Carlisle game to-
morrow afternoon”. As things look at
the present time the cheering at the
game "with the ‘Indians will be over a
hundred per cent. better than at any
other =tirn‘e this year. It will be re-
membered" that last year the Indians
won the game with Pitt "by a large
score and yet the cheering at' that

Pitt lost the game, the work of the
Pitt rooters at that game was the

University up to thegpresent time. Al-
most every other party in the political

ﬁeld to-day has a club in the Univer- _-

sity-’--at least the Democra”ts"and the
Progressives are making things lively
around the campus. Meetings age
held most every day by the Wilson
and the Roosevelt men, but so far
there has been nothing done towards
the forming of a Taft club. Surely
there are some students in the Uni-
versity thatare in favor of*having Mr.
Taft elected again. If so, now is the
time for a club to be formed."

These clubs will do the student
body a great amount of good and the

_speakers‘ thﬁat the leaders of the Wil-

son and Roosevelt anizations have
planned to bring to,the University

will well.-be worth listening to. 'The 1
more clubs that are put in the field

the better will be the result obtained.

There cannot be too many of these’

organizations in the University. '

FOOTBALL: isITUATIO‘N

There is no denying the fact» that A
up to the present tirne‘the football , _ . '
M The members of the board of .the

team this year has been a disappoint-
ment. The ‘team has not displayed
the kind of football that will win the
games that areon the schedule for
the latter part of the season, in. fact

the brand of.ba-ll that was played last‘

week would not‘ win one game in ten.
But there is no need for the. students
to take too pessimistic a view of the
situation, for we really , think that
things will turn out alright soon. We
are ﬁrm in the belief that the mate-
rial for a good team--a winning team
—is on hand and that before long Pitt
will strike her true gate and every-

of the latter part of the year. _

.There is no reason in the world
Why we should not defeat W. & J.
this year. After the Indianwlgame, at
Washington, it_ was thought that-the
Red and- Black was the only team in
the United States. but after the game
at State last week there were a few
of us ready to" say that perhaps the
team _from Washington 1 was not -a
world beater7after all. The Redskins
must have been away off color at the
Washington ,or» the ‘result of that
game would have been different than
it, was.
Pitt-Indian game may be, we feel sure
.that Pitt will be in shape to win from
.W. & J. next month."

After, many years of anxious wait-

ing for the annouhcement that the

dental school would be erected on the
‘University campus, the hope of our
dreams has comes to an end.— The

_’ .building which was dedicatedpin June
‘ ,is now in perfect condition and bids

fair to become the best known school
of the group. It may -also be said
that theldental school will. stand
among the foremost Dental Schools
of the country, or at least this~is the
aim of Dr. H. E. Friesell and the stu-

* dents. ‘

‘.The la-boratorie’s are ﬁlled with up-
to-date apparatus. . The inﬁrmary is
equipped with all the conveniences
possible, which makes the clinic /most
agreeable for the patients who are
treated there. The students are very
‘well pleased with -the new home and
,.will be with“ us in body .and mind in

‘ V _ the future.

‘The clinical work done at the
Dental School is of the best obtain-

’ able anywhere, and it is hoped that
students will take advantage of the*

opportunity offered‘ at the clinic. Ap-
pointments’-can be made at any time.

Changed.

 

The ’Varsity fail-edvto show im-
proved style last Saturday ‘at Forbes

_‘ -to swallow 2. bitter pill handed out by’
Bucknell University. Everyone inter- I

ested in Pitt athletics expected the
gridiron men to at least show some

‘improv-ementover the previous Satur-

day -but‘they were doomed to disap-
pointmen-t for the showing wasieven
weaker than before.

The worstpart of the exhibition

' ' was «that the Goldiand Blue players

were unable to solve an open forma-
tion -that‘ Bucknell used time -after
time. With this play the opposition

carried the ball to the Pitt goal line .

in the ﬁrst minute of playonly to be
stopped by the Gold and Blue line-
men when within a few feet of a
touchdown.
the same formation gave them a 50-

yard, gain and placed the ball on Pitt’s ‘

5-yard line. The line held Iour ‘downs

-and a score was ayerted. One would

think that after the same play had

been sprung a half «dozen times or

more the Gold and Blue kickers
would be “wise” but not so. In the
last ‘quarter with but a minute to play
Bucknell gained 40 yards with the for-
ward pass and on the next down
scored with the same old chestnut.
Hope this formation is not in the
Indian’s category as it is perfectly
good as.far as Pitt isicoricerned.
With the exception perhaps of Cor-
boy and Connelly the backﬁeld candi-
dates showed ‘up miserably. “Red”

Smith and Leahy putup a good game ..

in the line, but the rest were spunk.

Thegcoach of the freshman football
team is desirous that more men turn
out to try for the team than have

turned out up to the present time..

Practice is held daily at the new ath-
lletic ﬁeld. A good team_ can be
turned out, according to those in
charge of the work of getting a team

together, if a few more men will only

come out for practice.

Reports from the Fencing Club
show very good progress during the
last week._ A very good practice was

held Tuesday night and “the candidates ‘'

for the team to represent Pitt during

'0 the coming season are rounding into

good form. From present indications
Prof. Postgate, the instructor, will
have some trouble telling which three
men shall be on the team, as «they all
show up ﬁne. ‘ - 0

Negotiations are now on for a joint"

some time this
winter, but no particulars can ..as yet
,-be given.

It is earnestly hoped that quite a

few more new men will come out and

grasp this opportunityof learning the
game at such asmall outlay of time
and money. All indications point to
a promising year before the Pitt
fencers. .

BY PENN STATE

 

The overwhelming defeat adminis-
tered W. & J. by Penn State came _as
a decided-surprise“ to most followers

. of football, but the wise doipester-s had

prophecied the defeat,,but probably
by‘a smaller score; When, consider-
ing W. & J.’s strength, several fac-
tors imust be taken into consideration.
Theilndian ame‘ was not a, good in-
dication of their strength as the Red-
skins refused to “—ope'n 'up” and re-
sorted only to straight plays. Also
they were “off color” and‘ had the
poorest kind of luck. In the State
game W. & J. was facing a seasoned
eleven of 1910 and 1911 veterans on
their own’ ﬁeld and under other ‘un-
favorable conditions. The factithat
State scored three ﬁeld goals in the
ﬁrsst half was enough to kill the ﬁght-
ing spirit of ‘any team and cause a
general crumbling of defense later.‘ in
the game. State is probably better
than W. & J., but hardly 30-0 better,
.and ‘hadl the game been played in
Washington-,_th.e score.would proba-
bly have b.een 7 or 10-0,’ favor State.

‘dian game, and about 100>per cent.
wanted the Red and Black team to

that we do not love W. & J. theimore,‘

but merely wish to defeat a team with
a string‘ of viﬁtories to their credit.

I‘TALIAN CLUB HOLDS FIRST
MEETING OF THE YEAR

 

The Italian Club held its ﬁrst meet-
ing on Monday, October. 14th. Due
to’ the late announcement of the ﬁrst
meeting, few members were present;
accordingly no election was held, nor
any business transacted. _'The next
meeting will be held Saturday, Octo-’
ber*l9, at which you are requested to
be.present;. ‘ , ~ ‘
’ This club has been very successful
in its short career, bot'h socially and
intellectually. During the past year
it gave several entertainments which
were a credit to the University. In-
tentions ..:::re to eclipse the efforts of
last year, and we, ‘therefore, ask the
hearty co-operation of the students.
All interested in the Italian lan-guage
‘and literature are eligible for member-
ship. ’

ILLUSTRATED LECTURE.

 

At the weekly meeting of the En-
gineering students last Wednesday».

of the Westinghouse Electric and
Manufacturing C0,, gave a very inter-
-esting talk on the reduction of labor
in household duties.

After speaking for a few ngoments
had produced several
reels of moving pictures, illustrating
the modern appliances of electricity
in the’ home. I _ N
The ﬁrst picture thrown upon the

a foot‘-propelled machine. This was
followed by one showing the West-

sewing machine. The ‘contrast ex-
pressed in these ﬁrst -two illustrations
brought out very well the speaker’s
words: “Hard household labor is a
thing of the past. Electricity is tak-
ing the,place of physical force in
every line of work.’’ “

Like contrasts were shown of the
old and new way of.ironing. And
these in turn followed by pictures of

an electric stove, percola-tor, vacuum ”

cleaner, toaster," chaﬁng dis‘h,”etc.
Even the electric furnace was not'_for-
gotten. _ , _ ‘v
The lecture’ was concluded by sev-.
eral views of the Westinghouse fac-
tories, internal and external, especial-
ly those, showing the different steps in
the processes of making electric
motors and fans. ‘

 

Between the Bull Moosers and the
Wilsonians there ought to b‘e"e.nou-igli
of hot air distributed about the Uni-
versity to insure light fuelpbills this
winter. —
