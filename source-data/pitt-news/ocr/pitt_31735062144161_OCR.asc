Responds To
Pitt Benefit A

It’s over no-w——all but the pleas-
ant memory of a job well done.
When the ﬁnal curtain fell on “On
the Town” and the applause ceas-
ed,cPitt women heaved a proud
.si-gh. The Nixon theater was well
ﬁlled, and the audience had re-
-sponded enthusiastically to the
‘play. ‘Pitt women marked their
ﬁftieth anniversary at Pitt by the
success ‘of their Nixon beneﬁt.

The Beneﬁt may be looked upon
as “a ‘threefold success. Miss Rush,
dean of women, said, “I am more
than grateful ‘to the students. that
«helped. They did an excellent job.
While our -ﬁnancial success is not
to be spoken of lightly, for it is
an outstanding result, I am hap-
piest that so many people turned
-out to support the University and
Pitt women in carrying out this
project, the first of its kind at the
University.

Nan-cy Graper, student general

chairman, said. “We’ve never done
anything like this before at Pitt.
and for us the Beneﬁt was a great
experience. Best of all, we had a
wonderful time participating in
it.” The ‘Benefit was a success
popularly, for it added anote of
distinction to the ‘efforts of the
University and Pitt women.
. Financially, the Beneﬁt wastsuc‘-
cessful. Beatrice Rosenberg, ﬁn-
ancial coordinator of the project
gave the following report:

These ‘ﬁgures are still tentative.
The adswere outstanding in their
results. Bicky Feldman, chairman
of the «programand advertising
extends an “overall thank you to
the student body for their cooper-
ation which made our twelfth ﬂoor
beneﬁt a’ ﬁnancial success.” Mary
Vasilakis and Mae Boyer said that
they were proud to show such a
substa-ntial amount to be given to
the Twelfth Floor.

The Beneﬁt was a success coop-
eratively. Pitt ‘women have proven
their ability to organize into a co-
operative working group to fulﬁll
a project. Miss-. Irvine, who origi-
nated the idea of a theater beneﬁt,
wishes "to thank all the students
who supported the project, and
who helped to carry it out. '

Miss Rush explained how the
money earned is alreadyat work.
The -wing which will house stu-
dent headquarters, conferen-ce and
work rooms, and ‘a’ dressing room
with accompanying -shower room.
is,now u.nder completion by means
of this money. In this way the
Twelfth Floor will soon be acces-
sible to the women.

Nancy Gra-p-er, on behalf of the
student -chairman and committee
members, wishes to thank Miss
Rush. ‘Miss Irvine, and Dr. lsaacs
for their valuable advice, and for
the time they gave in assistance.

It looks like fun, but these Pitt students really mean business.
They are part -of the 37-member delegation to the Intercollegiate
Conference on Government holdingits annual ‘convention’ in Harris-
burg this week. : A

Pitt Political Delegation
Leaves For Harrisburg

Martin Rothman, chairman at the Pitt delegation to the Inter-
collegiate Conference on Government, has given last-minute instruc-
tions to the would be politicians before they leave for Harrisburg to-

morrow.

“Our bills must be passed and our own ideas incorporated

 every piece of legislation,” Martin stated.
Thirty-seven delegates will leave the University at 1 o’clock to-
morrow afternoon to attend the three-day session of the Model Con-

Y Conference

Scheduled

I The theme of the annual Pitt

,YM-YWCA conference, scheduled

this year for April 5, 6, and 7 at
Camp Carondaw.anna, will be that
of “student leadership,” with the
emphasis on training student lead-
ers from within the ranks of the
YM an-d YWCA’s.

’ The program planned for the
Week-end will be varied. Empha-
sis will be on sports and out-door
activities. Already planned are
hikes, volley ball matches, and
boating on the Conequenessing
creek. In the evening there will be

-social and square dancing, and one

night will be devoted to charades
and “home-grown” skits.

The cost of the conference will
be $3.00 plus transportation ex-‘
penses. Bus transportation may be
secured from the Harmony bus
lines which run into Zelienople.
From ther-e it is but a short walk
or ride to the camp.

The entire Pitt group will leave
Pittsburgh Friday afternoon at ﬁve
o’clock an-d will return after din-
ner on Sunday. Should some stu-
dents have Saturday classes, how-
ever, special arrangements for
partial attendance at the confer-
ence on reduced rates can be made
at either the YM or YWCA ofﬁces.

“It is important that all students
who plan to attend the conference
sign up ahead of time,” announced
reservation chairmen Bob and
Mary Lou Grape. “The reason for

‘this is that the camp capacity is

about seventy persons, and we
wotild like to have an equal ratio
pf YM and YW members.”

Phi Sigma Sigma

Phi Sigma ‘Sigma, social fra-
ternity for women, will have an
open house for veterans from 2:30
to 45 o’clock on. Friday, March 29,
at 420 Neville Street.

Chairman Zelda Kernis hopes
that’ “All the veterans will start
off the week-end at this vet get-

_ together.”

¢gress, whiclfi is the form

the con-
ventio.n has taken. ’

Each of the 30- Pennsylvania col-
leges and universities has prepar-
ed several bills, which will be
presented to the rules committee,
which in turn will sort them and
assign the «bills to one of the fol-
lowing committees: agriculture,
commerce and ﬁnance, education
and welfare, foreign affairs, gov-
ernment organization and inter-
governmental relations, labor and
industry, military affairs, natural
resources, veterans affairs and the
ways’ and means‘ committee.

During their stay in Harrisburg
the student-politicians will have
the. opportunity to imitate the
Washington bigwigs. Committee
rep_orts will be presented on the
floor of the forum, at which time
voting will take place in the gen-
eral meeting of all the delegates.

Highlight of the convention will
be the election of the speaker.
Schools will present candidates for
that ofﬁce to faculty advisors and
the men best suited will be pre-
sented to the general meeting for
election. Pitt’s candidate is Frank-
»lj.in Blackstone Jr., and candidate
for the office of secretary is Mary
Jane Kash.

The election will not take place
until Saturday morning at 9
-o’clock, allowing time for cam-
paigning. Pitt ha.s prepared lapel
tags and large placards in its cam-
paign to have Blackstone elected
as speaker.

 Sharing highlight honors will be
a dance in the ballroom of the
Penn-Harris hotel on Saturday
evening. Howard Gale, currently
featured at Saturday night dances
at the army separation center in
Indiantown Gap, will provide the
music. .

.Pennsylvania’s Governor Mar-
tin will officially open the session
on Friday morning and opening
speeches will be presented by two
Washington senators of the re-
publican and democratic parties.

Spririg Festival
Highliglitcil.
By Vet Revue

Highlight of Spring Festi.val ac-
tivities scheduled for May 8, 9,
.10 and l.l will be the evening’s en-
tertainment at the Syria Mosque
on Friday night, May 10. The fes-
tivities will consist mainly of three
p_arts—-an alumni smoker, the vets
revue, and a radio broadcast fea-
turing a national known radio per-
sonality.

This event and others to be an-
nounced later are in line with
Chairman Bicky Feldman’s previ-
ously announced intention of mak-
ing this year’s Spring festival
“the best in campus history”.

“Now that the war is over, we
really intend to show the world
just what Spring Festival time at
Pitt can really mean,” said Chair-
man Feldman. “Our plans are big
and we expect the results to be
just as big.”

‘Grover lVI-cCann is chairman of
the Syria Mosque affair, and John
Grimes is in charge of the Vets
revue. Both are members of the
Veterans asso-ciation. They serve
as publicity director and presi-
dent respectively.

‘Talent and initiative with dou-
ble emphasis on both are the pres-
ent needs of the revue, “George
Vet Scandals.” As currently proj-
ected, the plans call for a two
hour revue in conjunction with
an alumni smoker and the broad-
cast of a national radio program.
Bob Hope, Kay Kyser, and others
are being mentioned as possible
radio stars who will be at the Mos-
que in person.

Production is slated to begin
March 28, and veterans who can
write, sing, play, act, or do any-
thing else connected with stage
work are urged to attend tryouts.
Applications are currently avail-
able in the Pitt Players office on
the eighth ﬂoor

Accordfng to Chairman Grimes,
servicemen were known through-
out the war for the excellence of
the theatrical presentation put on
by various service groups such as
“This Is The Army” and “Wing-
ed Victory”. “Now that the war is
over”, he said, “we want to show
everybody what ex-service men
can do when it comes to putting
on a stage presentation. The revue
will be conducted on as thoroughly
a professional basis as possible and
will afford every participating vet-
eran an excellent. opportunity to
present his or her talents before
a large audience.”

The intensity of controversies over the inequalities of labor
and capital; Britain picking 011 Russia; and the United States
turning aggressor intthc Paciﬁc areas appear to question the re-
turn of a cooperative peace. . '

The continuation of this petty wrangling will inevitably
affect the diplomatic condition of present relations. From this
tendency,‘I assume people did without cigarettes and "butter
for four years that Russia would be free to obtain a -few more
quarts of oil; Britain to conquer Greece; and the United States
to exploit a luscious Far East. Perhaps it’s plausible.

Then again, to limit my point, the United States is pretty
busy junking plenty of unused war materials into this__lu‘scious
Far East, all for the purpose of exploitation in the, future, as
We exploited the Philippines and Philadelphia. Ma.ybe I’m
wrong, but instead of bickering like so many hens in a barnyard,
some of these enthusiasts should stick to our front door and Ztry
to clean up our mess. This seems a fairly reasonable request.

Several interested parties worked pretty hard to form this
country into a place where all manners of tirades could be un-
leashed against them. A «few more helped in its devclopme_n't.
‘No one can question that we have inherited a responsibility,’ to
keep their work going. Even though the Communist would
have us slaves to his doctrines, and chained to a dictatorship,
the States are still the States in my vocabulary. They need
healthy backing in this period of reconversion, both in domestic
relations and international affairs. Any semblance of a -solution
will require the desire for a lasting and effective settlement
between labor and industry; the United States and Russia.
Without some means of arbitrary arrangement brought about
by a well-meaning, conscientious council and supporters, people
did without cigarettes in vain -. .. .. again.

If there are those, who in the steadfastness of their pur-
pose, ﬁnd the humdrum routine of a free country uninterest-
ing andlacking in op_portunit.y, let them search for better in
the rest of the world. _',l‘l1e conviction thatt a way of life lies in
the import-ance of personal iiiitiativc is democracy. Tile con-
viction that a way of life lies in the iniportance of the deiﬁed
state is co1111111m_is1u. The problem in our dcmoclfacy is how to
have individuals and‘ groups operate together liarmoniously.
Belief in the concept that free men may live together peace-"
fully is founded on a cooperative theme. ‘X

When do we start refraining from childish criticisms of
honest 1nen’s opinions and divcrtour vigor into sound, “healthy
reconstruction of ideas? ,

Ah, me, Rush week is over. It
was so nice in the,«_'.§‘uck shop while

"it lasted. Everyibody wearing shoes
makes a difference. It's not true

that this column wasn’t rushed.
No sir, the Delts‘ wanted u.s to go
to the Phi Gams, the Phi Gams
wanted us to ‘go, to the SAE’s, and
the SAE’s wanted us to go to-—
well anyhow——~so what, we still
have our discharge pin.

3 It was interesting, watc-hingthe
frats -operate. The trophies and
the athletes were dusted‘ off and
set out to view“but« hot to touch.
The trap doors 'were_we_ll oiled as
were some of thegbod brothers.
And the vets were ‘well rushed. As
a matter of fact there was a ‘clus-
ter of ‘Greeks outside every vet
class that must have given the
impression of an over anxious
draft éboard.

Dohcrty Wears
Commendation

Master Sergeant James T. Do-
herty, Chief Clerk, ROTC and
manager of the rifle team, has
been authorized to wear the Army
Cvommendation‘"Ribbon based on
the Certificate. of Commendation
issued on September 20, 1945.

Sgt. Doherty received the Cer-
tiﬁcate of Commen£‘lation_in rec-
ognition of his service in having
made a suggestionjto the Army
suggestion committee which will
probably result in afsaving of over
half a million dollars for the
Army. ., .
= ‘The authorization reads essen-
tially as follows:

By the direction of the
Secretary 91’ War, Master Ser-
geant Jzggaes T. Doherty,
13000978, is,autho_r_-_lzed to wear

bon based ’ on [Certiﬁcate of
Commendation issued by the
Commanding General, Third
Service Command.

vernal Faculty

Two members of the faculty of

I the S;choo1,_9'6f Dentistry have re-

turned frorn”servic‘él'*lXrith the arm-
ed forces. Dr. Sidi R. Bononi. a
captain in the Army Dental Corps,
has resugied his post ’as"instructor
in oral ~surge'ry. Dr. A. ‘C. Young
Jr., a._li_eutenant in, the Navy Den-

, talcorps. .&has.'also-r_e1urne.d as in- _
structor in crown and bridgework.

Some of the frats really went
all out. One, in particular, we re-
member. Nylons were given to
rush-ee’s dates-— which is a good
way of making sure that the wom-
en are well “stocked.” Other frats
made much -of their houses--all
outside rooms, -baths outside, too.
But every fraternity c-onscientiou-s-
ly obeyed the rushing rules. It
wasn’t easy, but they did it. The
dictum “no women in the house
Friday night” was strictly adhered
to—of course, this made the lawns
a triﬂe crowded. Well, anyway it’s
all over now. It’ll be nice seeing
some of the familiar faces in class
again. Not inferring that any of
the frat men misses classes to
rush, but Dr. Is.aacs greeted one
with “Mr. Zilch, the class has
missed you.” The bedraggled
Greek replied, “Dr. Isa-acs, I’ve
missed the class.” ,

Do you have a roof over your
head? Would you like a roof-over
your head instead of an axe—-
hmml? Well the Pitt Vets associa-
tion is conducting a survey of
housing conditions and if you have
any particular problems commu-
nicate them to the V-ets associa-
tion.

Looks like the GI Revue will be
a big part of Spring festival. Might
be that if the show is right that
it will give Cap and ,Gown a run
for its.p1.ace on campus. Any GI,
male or female, who has been or
would like to be a part o.f a typi-
cal GI entertainment should give
this deal a buzz.

Can Drive On
For One .Weel{

The canned food drive has been
extended another week to give the
students more time to bring in

cans or money contributions. This
week large cans have been placed
in the tuck shops and the mess
hall to hold change that will buy
food for the hungry people of Eu-
rope and Asia.

Representatives from Women’s
Self Government Association,
Young Men's Christian Associa-
tion, Young Women’s Christian as-
sociation, and Women's Speech as-
sociation, collecting goods at the
ground ﬂoor booth, have reported
an intake of 25 cases and $84.29 in
cash. Friday was the -peak day of
the drive, when 137 cans were
brought in by individual students.
Co-chairmen Penn Burke and Ab-
bie Westermann say that if this
goal is reached every day of this
week, the quota of 5-000 cans will
be met. Emphasis is placed, how-
ever, on those who are unable to
bring in foodstuffs, but who can
«give money for their purchase.

Every organization on campus
has’-been asked to give generously
to this drive, and many students
and faculty members have also en-
rthusiastically co-operated.

Red Cross Results I F -

Com.plcte returns of the Uni-
versity Red Cross drive indicate
that Pitt students and faculty
members surpassed their set
goal by $1100. Students con-
tributed $1687.99 and faculty
members $4220.25, making ato-
tal of $5908.24. The goal set by
the University Red Cross fund
committee was $4800.

Wartime Teaching in England

By Jay Gluck

“-I guess you’d like to know
something of the opportunities for

education afforded the Gls over,-_‘ ‘

seas,”:_Dr. W. George Crouch said

‘- as he, leaned back in his office

chair and lit the two inch stub of
his cigar’.

The Shrivenham American uni-_
versity (the Army name for it):
where Dr. Crouch taught Speech
courses. from July through Def
cember, 1945, and gave a seminar

in the Romantic Poets of the Early ,
Nineteenth Century was a unique‘ .

university.

It was unique, first of all, in the
matter of location. It was only 23
miles from Oxford; 45 miles from
Stratford-on- Avon, Shakespearefs
home—-“A marvelous opportunity
for literature‘ and drama stu-
dents”; 50 miles from Bath where
there ‘ were old Roman remains
and spas; a two" hour ride from
Wi_n—chest.er and Salsbury; within
two hours of Stone Hinge where
there were archeological remains
of early British civilization; and
it_.was not far from Coventry’, a
manufacturing center which af-
forded a practical comparison of
British and American industry.

Shrivenham was very much like
anyAmerican university. A stu-
dent could get almost any sub-
ject he would ordinarily be study-
ing-at home and. could participate
in almost any extra curricular ac-
tivity. ” _[

~ The Shrivenham Symphony or-
chestra, for instance, was quite
well known. It was so good,‘ in
fact, that last year the musicians
were invited to London togive ‘a
concert over Thanksgiving. While
they were there they had an "op-
portunity to hear the London
Philharmonic orchestra under the
direction of Sir Thomas Beecham.
When the "Stars and Stripes was

no longer printed in England‘, the

Shrivenham newspaper was the
prime source of news for Gls on

campus. On Thanksgiving day the

university's football team played
the traditional Thanksgiving day
game against a team from a near-
by airbase. .

Dr. Crouch had a particular in-
terest in the Debate "tearn. At one
time his boys debated a girl's team

from St. Margarets on the perti-
ggnent
.-[more and more about less and

subject “Should we teach

less or less and less about more

and snore?” Dr. Crouch said,
“Those girls did very well!” The

"students in radio technique class-
“es ' broadcast every night from

their bwn radio station which was
a part of the Armed Forces net-
work in England. Some of their
broadcasts were beamed directly
to the United States. “This oppor-
tunity for practical work was in-
valuable”, was Dr. Crouch’s com-
ment. “The whole aim of this
university was to make the transi-
tion from military to civilian life
as easy as possible for the GI”,
he said.

At a party given by the vice
chancellor of Oxford for the
Shrivenham boys just before
‘Christmas he presented General
Thiele, commanding officer of
Shrivenham, with a 16th century
map of the Shrivenham area and
said how much he though the es-
tablishment of an American uni-
versity in England had helped
Anglo-American relations. As one
of the GIS said to Dr. Crouch,
“This is the best deal we ever
had.”

Although it was just a “good
deal” for the GI, for Dr. Crouch
born in London, England, it was
an experience he’ll never forget.
Besides seeing many relatives and
old friends he met several inter-
nationally known scholars who
wre part of the Oxford facul‘ty——
men like Nevill Coghill, who gave
Shakesperean plays outdoors in a

Flying Club

Over 300 students attended the
first oﬁicial meeting of the Pitt
Flying club last Friday. The pur-
pose of the meeting was to clear
several points concerning eligibili-
ty required to take the ﬂying
course, an-d qualifications set up
by the CAA for a pilot’s license.

Sam Heggi, the president of the
club, discussed the aims purposes,
and plans of the organization, af-
ter which he introduced the speak-
ers.

Dr. James S. Taylor, professor
-of mathematics and head of the de-
partment, spoke about the courses
open to students could enter in
commercial aviation. He has also
-been made head of the aviation
program at Pitt.

As one of the training ofﬁcers of

the Veterans administration, Mr.
Gerald McCann stated the require-
ments veterans must meet to be
eligible for the ﬂying course. He
‘said the deans of the various
schools at Pitt would have to ap-
prove taking the course based on
the relationship their major studies
had with ﬂying.
‘ Mr. Guy Miller, Miller Avia-
tion center, discussed the facilities
open to members of the ﬂying
clu-b. He stated there would be
clubrooms for pilots at the Coun-
ty and Bettis airports, and the
center would have Cubs, Aeron-
cas, Stinsons, BT—l3’s, and AT-6’s
available for use by club mem-
bers.

The next meeting is scheduled
for Friday, ll/larch 29, fifth hour,
Room G-24 CL. The same speak-
ers will be present.

rustic setting; C. L. Lewis whose
ﬁeld was 16th century literature;
and Allardice Nichol who was in-
terested in promoting an interna-
tional theater during the war to
give the actors of blitzed London
a chance to continue their art in
outlying districts. He met not only
scholars, but also the people of
England.

For a time Dr. Crouch lived with
some of the English people. 0!
them he said, “The farmers were
the most hospitable people I’ve
ever known. It was interesting tr
get their viewpoint on agricul-
ture.” To him the reaction of the
people was most important so he
went out of his way to meet all
kinds of people. For the British
women he had the greatest admir-
ation —— for their courage and
stamina during the war.

We kissed goodbye to the un-
paralled chow line when we re-
signed from the Army, didn’t we?
Don’t look now, fellows, but if you
get kicking around in the cellar
of the Cathedral of Learning some
day when that old feeling of wan-
derlust (th-e Army -called it loot-
ing) comes back, you’ll ﬁnd an
Army cafeteria. We had heard
about it but remembering the con-
coctions we had found. in our mess
kits w'hen we reached the end of
the chow line in the Army, we
kept just as far away from the
basement as our classes would al-
low. But we heard it was a pop-
ular spot around meal times so we
thought we would go dow'n to get
an idea of why the college vets
would allow themselves to be sub-
jected to anything that they ever
had anything to do with in the
Army. We found that there is as
much difference between the Pitt
Army cafeteria and the Army
chow kitchen as there is between
chili con carne (Army style) and
food.

Even sweating out the line is
different for if you were able to
stand in an Army chow line and
watch a flock -of pretty dolls go by,
you were at le-ast a general.

And what is this business about
having your food dished into vari-
ous compartments in your platter?
In the Army, chicken with all the
trimmings was hash. Here, it is
chicken with all the trimmings. (I
do not swear that they even serve
chick-en with all the trimmings,
but I can use it for an example,
can’t I?) And we found that the
dialogue between the disher—out-
ers and consumers varies consid-
erably from the stock Army,
“Come on, what ’er ya saving it
fer, the Captain?” and the answer,
“Shed up, ya fadder’s mustache
and move on.” Here it goes some-
thing like this, “Is that enough?”
and the answer “Whatjer say,
babe?” (Moral: you can change
a civilian but a doggoned vet is
a vet until he dies.)

What do you think about tak-
ing your chow into a spacious din-
ing hall, setting it on a table next
to a blond’s, and then sitting down
to eat it? It’s true, it happens
here!

Whil.e you eat your food, we can
call it that now, you do not have
to worry about whether the mess
water i.s going to be cold and
greasy for when you take your

tray to the proper place, you ﬁnd ’

that you do not have to wash it

at all. You simply give up your ‘

various implements to waiting at-
tendants an-d then go to the Com-
mons room and get better ac-
quainted with the blond.

For the coming summer the
Schools of Engineering and Mines
will conduct a regular undergrad-
uate summer semester. Registra-
tion will be June 13. 14. 15, ac-
cording to E. A. Holbrook, Dean 01
the Schools of Engineering and
Mines. ‘Classes will begin June 17
and the semester will end Septem-
ber 6. '

All freshman, sophomore, and
junior students will be scheduled
for a full—time load for the twleve

weeks with a minimum of twe_l_vei .

semester credits and a maximum
of fourteen semester credits. Sen-
iors will be scheduled at the op-
tion of their own department. The
chemical engineering and the pe-
troleum engineering department
heads have indicated that they
will offer a regular full-'time,pro-
gram of senior courses. Decision
has not been reached in the other
departments on senior subjects.

Block schedules for all present
full-time day and full-time after-
noon and evening fresh-men are
arranged for daytime sections
only. In other words, ali full-time
freshmen will be registered inday
sections, and not in evening sec-
tions, as has been necessary this
semester. _ 

Because of the necessity of car-
ing for a maximum number of
students, it is necessary that a
student attend the summer se-
mester if he expects automatically
to receive a permit to register in
September for the fall semester.

Tracksters
Training In
Stadium

By Al Roth

Tentative arrangements ﬁnd Carl
Olson and his Pitt trackmen pre-
paring to entertain an attractive
schedule this spring on the cin-
derpaths.

The Panther tliinclads who have
begun outdoor training sessions at
the stadium this week are eager-
ly looking forward to their first
full spring track program since
1942.

The first big attraction will ﬁnd
an, as yet, undetermined amount
of Blue and Gold thinclad quar-
tets entraining for Philadelphia
wherevthey will be entered in the
Annual Penn Relays on April 26
and 27. The Eastern Pennsylvania
affair is one of the top-ranking

.meets in the nation and attracts

the cream of the season’s, track
crop. '

Inasmuch as the Panther mentor
is not in the position to judge
whether or not he will be able t-o
derive a full track and ﬁeld squad
from the “fruitful resources now
in training, emphasis will be laid
on triangular rather than the con-
ventional dual meets.

"A. deﬁnite date on the Pitt cal-
endar is one of thesethr-ee sided
affairs which will pit the Olson-
men against the ranking number
one and two footrace squads in
the East,’ Army and New York
University. These ‘schools have
gained this distinction vby virture
of their performance in the IC4A
indoor championships earli-er in
the campaign, in which they ﬁn-
ished in the above mentioned or-
der. The meet has been set for the
Army home at West Point.

Another three team embroglio

* would ﬁnd the Nittany Lions of

Penn State playing host to the
Jungle Cats and Maryland. The
Lions and Cats have both agreed
and are, at present, awaiting con-
ﬁrmation from Maryland oﬂicials.

Olson is also working on a dual
meet. for his charges with the 10-’
cals to entertain at the Stadium.
However since the cinder path is
still in poor condition_ nad jump-
ing pits yet to be constructed, the
Panther track king does not feel
that it would be feasible to close
the deal as yet." 

Zeller Selected
On All-East Team

Hank Zellers, who led Pitt's bas-
ketball forces in scoring the past
season with 176 points in 14
games, has been selected to play
on the eastern team in the East-
West All-Star game in Madison
Square Garden, Ne,w_:-.York, Sat-
urday. He was named-by Joe Lap-
chick, St. John's coach, who will

 head the eastern stars.

It packs plenty of height, for a
6-feet-7 with these cagers.

Pitt News All-America
Basketball Team

By George J. P. Kiseda .

With an air of authenticity from having seen two of the players
named (neither of them this year), we herewith present the Pitt

for 1946.

This glint quint could give any outﬁt in the country the bum’s

coach could ﬂoor a unit averaging

make one of LaGuardia’s fire

chases resemble a cake Walk.

Four of the standouts are under
the six-foot standard—added proof
that Phog Allen, the Kansas mouth
organ, is. off the beam in his
charges that the little men don’t
have a chance in basketball.

Because of the abundance of
material, a 10-man squad has been
named, with no distinction be-
tween first and second teams.
Here they are:

Forwards: E r n i e Calverley,
Rhode Island State; Don Otten,.
Bowling Green; Max Morris,
Northwestern; and Leo Klier,
Notre Dame.

Guards: Ken Sailors, Wyoming;
Jack Goldsmith, Long Island; Sid
Tannenbaum, New York; and Billy
Hassett, Notre Dame.

Centers: George Mikan, De Paul,.
and Bob Kurland, Oklahoma A.
& M.

Only 5-foot-10, Calverley was

one of the fastest men in the game.
In 87 games during his four-year
career, he collected '1868 points,
averaging 21.5 per tilt. Otten,
who stretches to the 6-foot-111/2
mark, paced Bowling Green to 27
wins in 32 scraps with 470 points.

Probably the best man in the

In the matter of speed. it would’

Big Nine, Morris led the confer-

ence scorers for the second suc-
cessive season with 198 markers

in a dozen tilts. Klier-—whose
one-hand push shot has been

called the best in basketball-—
mustered 355 points in 21 games
‘for a new Irish record.

Sailors——once tabbed by "Chick
Davies the “fastest dribbler in the
nation”—-was the playmaker and
feeder on a Wyoming team that
lost but four games. .

A mere 5-feet-7, Goldsmith
made the big boys look sick with
his long-range set shots, averaging
17.1 per game.

Primarily a feeder, Tannenbaum
dropped in 251 tallies in 21 tussles,
was elected Gotham’s outstanding
player of 1946. At 5-feet-10, Has-
sett was the captain and bell-
wether of Notre Dame’s “Squeeze
Kids.”

The mighty Mikan was the
“player of the year” for the third
season in a row. The 6-foot-9
giant brought his four-year count
to 1870 points in 97 games, a rec-
ord for major competition. 1

A 7-footer, Kurland-_—e.xcept.ifor
a man of Mikanfs calibre-would
be.-.“player of the year.” The "sec-
ond biggest basketeer in the na-
tion, he was the only cager in the
country to top 600 points.

Sports Editor

It has been a long time since a head football coach at Pitt has
asked the various organizations on campus to have him attend a
meeting as a guest speaker. That’s just what Wes Fesler, our new
head coach, would like.

“Don't call me Mr. Fesler; Mike Milligan, Mr. Milligan; or
Doc Han-twig, Mr. Hartwig. We want to be known as Wes, Mike,
and Doe and whenever you see me on the campus or on the street,
say ‘Hi Wes’ a.nd even though I might not know your name I'll
answer back.” The above attitude is just what Wes would like

V to instill in the student body.

“We need the backing of the students, in fact the backing of
everyone and we hope to get it,” said the Pitt head coach.

One thing certain Wes, Mike, and Doc are off to a good start.

What Wes would like to do is make everyone a salesman. Your
job is to sell the athletes fr.om your hometown Pitt and Pitt in return
can sell these boys to the public. How does a manufacturer sell his
He doesn’t advertise it one day in the year but keeps that
name in front of the people at all times.

In place of the manufacturers product we can _put a football ‘_
player. If a high school star, let's say goes south and makes the
first string. who up north ever hears of him? Except for a line
or two in the local papers, he is completely forgotten. Now if that

H same grid star had played ball in the university in his district
the papers would be playing him up time and again.

This section around Pittsburgh is the most productive area for
football players. That is why colleges from all parts of the country
raid our ranks. The sad part of it all Wes stated, “Is that these col-

leges disturb the mental thinking of our district athletes. The boys
just look at the present instead of ‘THINKING AHEAD FOUR?
YEARS’.” Our ﬁrst thought at Pitt is to give the boys a good educa-'
tion, thatis why they come to college and secondly‘comes football.”
Whenever you see that hometown star ask him one question. '
_Where do you intend to make your home in the future? If his
. reply has him making his home in the district about Pittsburgh
and making plans to play football, basketball, orany other sport
in another part of the state or country—teil him to “LOOK
J AHEAD FOUR YEARS” when he will be goingout for a job.
The free advertising which he received as a district athlete is
sure to sell the boy over another athlete who starred in the south,
west, north,’ or east who received that one line of publicity in his

Dental Seniors
Intramural .

Cage Champs

The grand ﬁnale of the~Intra-
mural Basketball league was
reached on Monday night, with the
Dental seniors copping the title by
defeating the Educational Fresh-
men 23-19. The quarter-ﬁnals.
semi-ﬁnals and ﬁnals were all
played last week, and the thrilling
climax found the Dents and the
freshies locked in a nip-and-tuck
duel, with the freshies ahead at
the quarter, the game tied at the
half. the Dents ahead at the end
of the third quarter, and with a
minute and a half left to play in
the game and the score tied at
17-all. Norm Titlebaum, a Dent,
came through with a brilliant
backhand shot to put his team

ahead and go on to ﬁnally win the '

game.

For his consistency and brilliant
playing ability, the News wishes
to name Norm Title-baum as the
outstanding performer of this tour-
nament. In Monday night's see-
saw battle of the courts, Title-
baum, a 5’9” ball. of ﬁre. continued
to burn up the ﬂoor with his bril-
liant passing and continual scor-
ing. He kept the -ball going through
the hop at an extremely fast pace
for this low-scoring game, and

was the individual high scorer, ac- "

counting for 9 of his team’s 23
points.

In the quarter-finals, the Edu-
national Freshmen whipped the
Dental sophomores lay the score of
43-28. ‘

The semi-ﬁnals saw the Dental
seniors beating the Dental juniors
27-21, in what was termed the
“game of the week.” Titlebaum
was again the high scorer with
eight points to‘ his credit. This
game really proved what a smart
ball club the seniors have. T-he
iuniors ioutclassed the older fel-
lows by using .an exceptionally
fast ‘break, but the seniors de-
ployed two men "pack in enemy
territory as a counter measure,
and outguessed the juniors at all
times.

For Spring I 3 Now The Thing

By Jim

Spring, that turner of fancies
and producer of head colds is here
again. And——as it must be on all
campuses-spring fever is cur-
rently the feature of the Pitt cam-
-pus. Have you been experiencing
its symptoms personally?

Do Safyan's ties seem suddenly
drab to you? Have you lost your
vigor for crashing Tuck Shop
lines? Does Pearl Wciner no long-
er seem to ‘be her bouncy peppy
;clf? Do fair members of the op-
‘,.OSllLC sex no longer provoke your
stares? If so, the odds on you
‘iaving spring fever are just about
'1 surething. However, if that di-
ignc-sis is incorrect, well—ah,
you may as well face it — you’re
dead.

Seeking to scrape up a fair-to--
middlin’ amount of colloquial com-

then, Fitzroy Fahrenheit, the
scholar, tip-toed by. “Really old
boy,” he -confided, “Its all in your
mind. Just a psychological quirk,
you might say,” Mumbling some-
thing under our -breath that
rhymes with quirk, we left him
under a tree with a month old Pn-
lice Gazette and a bottle of 90
proof sasparilla. We keep cruis-
ing around a little while longer,
watching the starry-eyed ar-m-in-
arming of vari-ous inamorates and
inamoratos. Then, after a couple
of quick look—sees in the Tuck
shop (Where nothing exciting was
happening at that moment), we
decided to journey over to Schen-

 

ley park. We hear they have ﬂow-
ers or weeds or something there!
