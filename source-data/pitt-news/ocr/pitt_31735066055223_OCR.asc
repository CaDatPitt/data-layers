SGB supports voter education

By Tina Charkaway
For The Pitt News '

The Student Government Board sent the
Allocations Committee back to the drawing
board with a 4-3 vote at last night’s meet-
ing, sending the message that financial aid
and voter registration is a top priority on
campus. .

The Governmental Relations Committee
requested money to send four representa-
tives to Youth Vote ‘96, a conference which

I will be held at Harvard University, which is

centered on training students to educate
their individual campuses on election issues,
including that of education.

“We can’t lobby in a vacuum,” said board
member Keith Campbell.’ “This conference
will give us tactics to get out and vote, and
that’s what we need to do.”

The Allocations Committee denied the ',
GRC’s request claiming it wasn’t directly s

related to the committee’s fight against the
cut in student aid.

Board member Lee Bannister supported
the Allocations committee’s denial.

“We ask all student organizations to prior-
itize its funding goals, and I just feel it was
ranked as a low priority.”_ 5 .

The request has been returned to the
Allocations Committee for further review.

The board also clarified the policy con-
cerning alcohol and the shuttle system.

“It was thought [by shuttle drivers] that
any student under the inﬂuence of alcohol
would not be allowed on the shuttle,” said

Marc Friedberg. “The actual policy is any.
student under the influence considered a .

threat to either the driver or other passen-
gers would be prohibited.”

’ Recycling on campus was also brought to
the forefront. Matt Brady, president of the

'_ Recycling Club, petitioned the SGB to form

an environmental committee to educate and
raise awareness about environmental issues

H on -Pitt’s campus.

‘ “A few years ago the chancellor signed a
document stating Pitt would be among the

first 25 institutions around the globe to be at V

jed Matt Brady. “That really hasn’t»hap-'

Yesterday afternoon thou-
sands of people around the
country gathered to learn
about the causes and effects of
violence. Among them were
the 50 or sostudents, profes-
sors and community workers
who came together in IP56
Forbes Quad.

As Charles Kuralt, the veter-
an CBS news journalist, mod-
erated a discussion on the
issues of violence at the
University of North Carolina-
Chapel Hill, the messages
expressed went out via satel-

, lite to over 400 locations.

“Making the Connections,”
the first session of the telecon-
ference “Social Workers and
the Challenge of Violence
Worldwide,” brought together
a panel of 13 international
experts in the field of social
work and community organi-
zation. ’

In the first teleconference to
be sponsoredby the National
Association v of ‘Social
Workers, video clips of gender
persecution in India were jux-
taposed with
accounts -of, gang warfare in
Los Angeles. The poignant

they had agreed on a bipartisan
proposal on Medicaid, one of
the major stumbling blocks in
the budget impasse between
President Clinton and

now set by the federal govem—

House and Republican leaders
in Congress have been looking
to them for suggestions about
how to overcome the current

Pitt is not alone: man campuses
bottle with the ”gree question"

By Vicky Palombizio
Staff Writer

(This is the second part of a two-part series on
the animosity between greeks and non-greeks

on Pitt’s campus. )

Despite the animosity that has long been felt
between the Greeks and independents on cam-
pus, at least one person believes the two
groups are capable of socially interacting, but
not without a little work from both sides.

“One of the clearest findings in social psy-
chology is that people always perceive their
own group more positively than others,” said
social psychologist Keri Ryan. “The million-
dollar question in psychological research is
how to facilitate these two groups.”

Ryan said that Greeks need to think of them-
selves as part of a larger group. She said that
they should be proud to be members of the
Greek system, but they should also realize that
they are members of the entire student body as
well.

ties at IUP, agrees with Dr. Ryan. He said that
his perception of Greek-independent conﬂict
originates from one group feeling that the
other has more control on campus.

“There is no overwhelming tension between
Greeks and non-Greeks at IUP,” he said. “In
my experience, this animosity arises on cam-
puses where the student body perceives
Greeks as receiving special treatment.”

Appolonia said that many independents
don’t feel that they have a voice, so they use
the paper, especially the editorials, to speak
out.

Appolonia said that a fight broke out
between members of Sigma Nu~and Phi Delta
Theta a couple of months ago, but it was
resolved quickly by the judicial board. He
said that there were a few articles written in
The Penn, IUP’s newspaper, condemning the
incident, but the Greeks did not defensively
respond to the editorials.

“The administration at IUP suggests that the
students don’t use the editorial page as the bat-
tlefield,” he said. “Everybody’s dirty laundry

then they can
begin focusing on common goals,” she said.

Ryan, assistant professor of psychology at
Pitt, said that these two groups shouldn’t fear
losing their identity in the communication
process. She said that people can still maintain
their identity and work together to achieve
common goals.

“Greeks think that they will lose their identi-
ty by working with independents, and vice
versa,” she said. “But if an individual identity
is strong, regardless of which group one
belongs, it will not be destroyed.” ‘

Ryan said that students will be more inﬂuen-
tial if they work together because they will
have a broader base of support. She said that it
would also help to dispel stereotypes from
both groups.

“Greeks need to go out of their way to wel-
come others to their group,” she said. “This
will give people a more accurate perception,
because the other side can rethink the images
they have about these groups by comparing
rumors with experience.”

Ryan said that these two groups shouldn’t
try to adopt one another’s lifestyles, but they
should at least try and understand one another.
She said that many stereotypes originate from
ignorance and that these two groups are no
exception.

“You don’t want everyone to think the same,
because that would limit the diversity,” she
said. “But you also don’t want this.conﬂict to
be so extreme that these two groups can’t
work together to accomplish anything.”

Other Campuses:
IUP

Pitt isn’t the only campus in Pennsylvania to
experience Greek animosity. Other campuses,
such as Indiana University of Pennsylvania
(IUP), are currently ‘experiencing Greek ani-

mosity. However, unlike Pitt, IUP’s conﬂict-

exists among members of the Greek system_
rather than between Greeks and non-Greeks.

Terry Appolonia, director of student activi- .

gest that our stu-
dents are above yours because we’ve
smoothed over it,” he said. “These things
come and go, but Pitt’s situation seems like
it’s been aggravated over a long period of
time.”

Appolonia said that the fact that Pitt is a
large, urban campus creates even more ani-
mosity. Many students feel that going Greek
on such a campus isn’t imperative because

there are many other organizations for stu-_

dents to join.

Appolonia said that the Greek-independent
animosity on campus isn’t surprising because
these two groups are associated with strong
stereotypes.

“You have a lot of independents saying, ‘I
don’t need to buy my friends,’ and you have a
lot of Greeks saying ‘If you don’t, then you’re
a loser,”’ he said.

Penn State

Rick Funk, Director of Greek Life at Penn
State University, said that there is no major
problem with Greek-independent animosity on
campus because there are many other organi-
zations for students to join.

“I’m not going to say that there is animosity
between Greeks and non-Greeks, and I’m not
going to say that there isn’t,” he said. “I will
say that there are differences between people
who join the Greek system and those who
don’t.”

Although Funk did not want to define these
differences, he did say that -they do not keep
independents from obtaining leadership roles
as Dr. Ryan suggested.

“Here at Penn State, the campus is so large

that if someone is not Greek, it doesn’t pre-
vent them from becoming student body presi-

dent,” he said. “Everybody finds their niche
on campus.”

There are over 30,000 undergraduates at
Penn State, and approximately 15 percent are

Greek, as opposed to 18,000 undergraduates at ‘

Pitt with approximately 12 percent Greeks.

Violence—

victim of gang violence,
Decesare said. '

“What kind of man is made
of a child living in that envi-
ronment?” Decesare urged the
audience to ask.

The conference addressed
ways to pull communities out
of despair and poverty, the
precursors to most violent
acts. Jay Cayner, president of
NASW, said social workers
must work to empower com-

‘ munities, share learning with
. each other and address the

causes, not just the symptoms,
of violence.

Hubie Jones, a 35-year vet-
eran in social work and spe-
cial assistant to the chancellor
for urban affairs at the
University of Massachusetts,
was also a speaker at the tele-
conference. He stressed that
case managers, community
organizers and all people in
the field of social work must
come together.

“It’s about a life—long com-
mitment,” he said. “We’re all
a part of this ball game. We’ve
got to be working together to
make it happen.”

The second session of the
teleconference, “Seeking
Solutions,” will be held Friday
Feb. 9, 1-2:30 pm in the
LHAS Auditorium at the
Montefiore Hospital (7 Main).
Various sites will be connect-
ed to the home base in North

’ Carolina by telephone. Guests

at screenings around the coun-
try will be able to discuss
issues with the panel and
Charles Kuralt. A statement
from Vice President Al Gore
will be delivered to'the tele-
conference audience to end
the national event. A discus-
sion session on local violence
will follow with those who are
in attendance. '

Willie McCray, program
organizer for the Pitt—based
screening, said that the tele-
conference is helping to show
students of social work the
traumas of violence from
around the world instead of
just telling them about them.

“It’s a matter of bridging the
gap between people in acade-
mics and those out in the
field,” he said.

The board also announced
that discount cards, to be

Opinions
"Y" not child care?

Y-M-C—A! It’s fun to stay at the Y-M-C-A! Or at least it
used to be. But the Village People probably won’t find open
arms welcoming them in from the street on a cold night any-
more. In fact, the YMCA/YWCA has strayed far away from
its original purpose.

The YMCA used to be a place where a person could spend
the night if he had nowhere else to go. The Young
Men’s/Women’s Christian Association now, however, is that
only in name. The institution is presently little more than an
indoor country club for the upper-middle class, and the lat-
est move by the downtown Pittsburgh facility proves that.

The downtown YMCA has decided to close the doors to

" its day—care facility, which had provided child care for

working poor and welfare families in the area for the past
six years. The reason given for the decision was best stated
by Director George Babish: “Economically, we’re losing our
shirts.” (Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, Feb. 5)

Economically? The YMCA was not established as a prof-
it-based organization, but now the child-care center is clos-
ing because it is not financially sound. ‘

The YMCA is not the only one at fault for allowing the
child care facility to close. The Y is required to pay almost
$100,000 in property taxes to the city, county and school
district, while almost every other YMCA in the country is
tax—exempt. The facility might not have to close its child-
care programs if these taxes were not such a burden.

But the burden of guilt is not to be entirely removed from
the YMCA. Even though it is a non-profit organization,
membership to the facility is around $900 annually. There is
no spending the night there if you have no place to go. In
fact, there is no using some of the facilities unless you have
special memberships to use certain equipment (for which, of
course, you have to pay extra). Even if you are a member,
additional fees are charged for classes. Swimming lessons,
aerobics classes — none of that is included in the cost of a
regular membership. .

While the YMCA complains about the ﬂattened-out mem-
bership numbers, it is little surprise that many people cannot
afford this high price. A family of four would have to shell
out over $3,000 just for a family membership, _and if the
children attended any class it would cost more. Who can
blame people for not paying those fees? A country club
membership doesn’t cost much more than that. If the YMCA
wants to increase its membership base and bring in enough
money to pay all the bills, including the ones for the day
care center, it should lower its membership fees.

Either way, neither the city nor the YMCA should allow
the day-care facility to remain closed. There are already too
many children in the streets because no one wants them or
because their parents can’t afford to send them to private
day care. What is going to happen to them if facilities like
the YMCA’s shut down? They might “lose their shirts,” and
not just financially. . i

We won't have any of THAT here

My girlfriend goes to work
every day wondering if it will be
her last. Yet, noteven a month
ago, she was secure in her posi-
tion, making a nice hourly wage.

Did sheibecome a bad work-
er? Hardly. Is her employer sud-
denly bankrupt? As if. Then
what’s the problem?

The city is trying to shut down

the building.

Catherine is adancer down at
Penn .l’s Live"'Nudes, the adult
shop on downtown’s Liberty
Avenue. Recently, the city decid-
ed not to renew the’ building’s
permit. The case is being disput-
ed right now, and from what I
can tell (the owner won’t speak
to any reporter out of fear of bad
press), it doesn’t look good.

This is part of the city’s efforts
to “clean up” downtown. If
you’ve been downtown, you’d
have to admit it could use it.
But, once again, government
involvement is the wrong solu-
tion. Pulling and pushing levers
in order to shuffle businesses is
not the business of the city. It
affects more people than those
who want a prettier downtown.

A city’s downtown area is, no
doubt, one of its unpaid adver-
tisements. Reputations are built
there, for better or for worse. So
the fact that there are some very
nice areas of Pittsburgh does lit-
tle to counter the image of a
downtown which shuts down at
6 p.m_. As much as the city
would like to remedy this, how-
ever, forcing a social change and
using economic players to do it
(however accepted a concept
this may now be) is immoral.

First, businesses, like most _

things in life, exist in a cycle
with their environment. While
the smut shops cannot be sepa-
rated for the people who patron-
ize them, they also cannot be
blamed for them. In other words,
even though such a store attracts
ugly brain-dead half-grunts, it’s
silly to assume that getting rid of
this store will transform down-
town into Harvard Square.

Even if all of the “bad” busi-

 

Robert
Chesnavich

nesses were booted with more

“pure” entertainment establish- ,

ments replacing them, that still
wouldn’t solve the problem,
because entertainment of all
sorts in Pittsburgh has already

' settled in its base locations. The
’ North Hills is for mallrats, South

Side for drinking, Oakland for
underage drinking and Squirrel
Hill for  uh, bagels? In fact,
everything in a city as old as
Pittsburgh has settled down
where it is comfortable, and
that’s the entire point: To try to
order the social changes that
would “revitalize” downtown
would require a total reorganiza-

L tion of the city’s lifestyle. You

wouldthink that crazy and
wrong to try to do, but that’s no
more wrong than what it’s trying
to do now; it’s only more obvi-
ously wrong.

To beat down the point fur-
ther, imagine Live Nudes clos-
ing and then reopening in
Sewickley, one of Pittsburgh’s
more upper-class areas. Call me
crazy, but I just don’t see it
working. A business locates
itself on the assumption that it
has found a good base for
attracting its kind of clientele.
Blaming a business for guessing
right — in this case, Live Nudes
locating downtown —— is entirely
counter-productive.

lJust as it is not the mandate of
any citizens to have their mon-
eys or resources taken from
them to help any economic goal,
so is it not the mandate of any
business to have their livelihood
stripped away to help any social

_ goal..

But I can’t go any further on
this point, because I need to
address another before I close.

The other is Catherine, who"

may soon be unemployed. I’m
usually not one to complain
about the economic ramifica-
tions of a legal action; that
would seem to contradict a lot of
what I said above. '

But it is hypocritical of this

0 city to damage the welfare of its

law-abiding citizens to achieve a
social or economic “good.”
Catherine’s “economic good”
right now consists of getting
back to Pitt, and she has.one
realistic chance to do this: save ‘
up enough money at this job. I
won’t say how much she makes,
but let me put it this way: You
wish you made nearly as much
serving fries, which is exactly
what she will wind up doing

,_ again if she is forced out of here.

I’m sure someone will also tell
me about the “oppressive”
nature of her job. Tell you what:
You tell her how oppressed she
is  and then duck. It suffices to
say that she‘ enjoys  uh, “pleas-
ing” herself for pay more than

you do for free. She’ll be t

oppressed the day that some
higher power tells her that she
can no longer do this — in her
own best interest, of course.
And what about the “morali-

ty” of this work? Heh heh heh.

Don’t even get me started. Just '
read some of my other articles
and guess how I feel about it. '
Catherine has dreams of grad-
uating in psychology and help-
ing others. Exactly what sort of
message will the city be sending
if it forces someone like this into
a position where she will be con-
stantly exhausted just supporting
herself? Well, I know what the
message will be, and it isn’t the
one I was meant to hear:
“Govemment, get the hell out
of our lives.”

Oh boy, here comesanother ranked team

Wallace,

No. 78 ’Cuse
visit the Civic
Arena tonight

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Pull out your tiny Pitt
Panther pocket schedule
and you might want to cry.

The ranked teams are in
major abundance, and the
train keeps on rolling
tonight as the Syracuse
Orangemen are in town to
wrap up the Civic Arena
series.

Syracuse is ranked 18th
in the Associated Press
Poll, a spot surprising to
many —who picked the
Orangemen to finish in the
middle of the Big East
Conference.

The Orangemen have
rebounded from the loss of

Lawrence Moten, now in

the NBA, and the transfer
of last year’s "starting point
guard Michael Lloyd.
Senior John Wallace has
taken over as Head Coach
Jim Boeheim’s go—to—guy.
He brings a 22.4 points-per-
game average to Pittsburgh.
While the Orangemen
(16-6 overall, 6-5 Big East)
are rolling, Pitt (9-9, 4-6) is
reeling from an 88-55
pounding at Villanova
Saturday. ‘ i

“We still have a long way
to go,” is how Panther bas-
ketball Head Coach Ralph
Willard put it after Kerry
Kittles scored 31 points in
the Villanova beating.

Wallace is Syracuse’s ver-
sion of Kerry Kittles — an
All-American candidate
who excels offensively and
defensively. The 6-foot-8,
225-pound power forward
from Rochester, NY was a
first-team All-Big East
selection last year and a
second teamer his sopho-
more season. He’s third in
the conference in scoring,
second in field goal per-
centage and fifth in
rebounds. ‘

Todd Burgan occupies the
small forward slot, and,
along with Wallace, they
will keep Pitt’s front line of

"Chad Varga, Gerald Jordan

and Mark Blount busy.
Burgan is averaging 13.2
points and six rebounds a
game.

Burgan, a sophomore
from Detriot went to the
same high school in New
Hampshire as Moten, and
he is quickly becoming’ a
fan favorite in the Carrier
Dome.

The backcourt is run by
senior point guard Lazarus
Sims, who leads the Big
East in assists, with just
over seven per game. Sims‘
backcourt buddy is Marius
Janulis, a sophomore from
Lithuania. He’s taken over
for injured junior college
transfer Jason Cipolla, and

he’s second in the Big East .

with a .455 3-point shoot-

Syracuse’s center is Otis
Hill, a junior whose cousin
is Boston College standout
Danya Abrams. Hill is scor-
ing 11.7 points per game,
4.8 boards and is a big
presence in the middle.

Just like the Panthers, the

Orangemen have a schedule
loaded with ranked teams.
Four of their six losses
have come against
Georgetown, Villanova,
UConn and UMass.

This is the first of a C

home-and-home series. Pitt

surprises for the Panthers this season. Ziska

‘ “Brett is one of the most talented

Payne said. “We just have to get him in the

Freshman Montesano does it all for struggling Lady Panthers

By Kevin Lilley
Staff Writer

Now well into a disappointing season, the Pitt
Lady Panthers can do little else but look toward the
future. .

During a 20-minute scrimmage last Friday, fresh-
man Gina Montesano played point guard, grabbed
a rebound from center Latia Howard and stopped a
driving Stephanie Petho in her tracks.

Montesano may be the future the Panthers are
looking for.

Practice is one thing, but the 5-foot-9 guard out
of Mercy High School in New York has played just
as well when it counts. A starter since game one,
Montesano has shown her versatility and ability
while piling up some impressive achievements.

Her high school achievements read like a rap
sheet: Mercy High’s all—time leading scorer, MVP
of the Ronald McDonald Senior All-Star Game.
second-team All—New York State, honorable men-
tion USA Today All—American. It adds up to a top-
college prospect.

Recruited by Big East rivals Villanova, Boston
College and Notre Dame, Montesano came to
Pittsburgh first.

“Pitt was my first visit, and I just loved it right
away,” said Montesano, adding that a longstanding
friendship with Pitt Assistant Coach Bethann
Shapiro helped her with the decision.

“She’s like a big sister,” Montesano said.

After playing the point at high school, Gina
moved to shooting guard for the Panthers, adding
another aspect to her transition to the college game.

“I just adjusted to the position,” she said, “and let
J OJ 0 [Guzman] handle the ball.” ’

Montesano received a baptism by fire at the new
position. After one home exhibition and two away
games, it was off to the Civic Arena to face

Duquesne and All—American Korie Hlede in front
of 11,000 people.

“I was so nervous before the game,” adrriitted
Montesano. “I’ve never played in front of a crowd
that size before.”

Montesano gave the big crowd a show, holding
Hlede to a career—low 12 points while scoring 14
points in the first half alone.

“The game didn’t turn out as planned,” said
Montesano of her team’s eventual 55-53 loss, “but
it was a good experience.”

The City Game set the tone for the rest of the
team’s season, which also did not turn out as the
Lady Panthers would have liked. Montesano, how-
ever, continued her stellar performance, including a
20-point effort in a Panther victory over Boston
College.

“That was the first home game my mom came
to,” said Montesano, who relied on mother Nancy
for “a little extra motivation.”

The BC "game was also Montesano’s last stand-
out performance to date. She scored only six total
points against Villanova and Connecticut before a
slight rebound against West Virginia last
Wednesday.

“I’m disappointed, very frustrated with my play,”
Montesano said, “but I don’t care as long as we get
a ‘W’ at the end.”

The team always comes first for Montesano.
Despite the move from point guard, Montesano has
stayed near the top on the team assist chart. She
cheers from the sidelines during the blue-vs.-gold
scrimmage at practice. She cheers her teammates
during free-throw drills. She even cheers sprints at
the end of practice, on occasion.

Not surprisingly, Montesano views Pitt’s 3-16

performance from a team perspective. “No seniors _

should have to go out like this_,” she said. “’Ihere’s
no giving up. We’re going to continue on.”

Pih‘ women's soccer travels long road in fielding a team

By Connie Nigro
Staff Writer

(Editors Note: This is the second
of a two-part series on the cre-
ation of the new women’s soccer
team.)

Just coming up with the idea
for a women’s soccer team was
not enough. There were a lot of
things that had to be settled.‘ For
example, ﬁnances and space for
games and practice had to be
found. Also, Pitt had to find a
new team and someone to coach
1t. '

There are many ways to go
about hiring a coach. One of the
main things Pitt did was to adver-
tise in the City Paper and in the

NCAA News. Pitt also put togetl1—
er a search Committee to look for
and write letters to potential
coaches.

“Pitt is pro—aCtive in terms of
searching. We hope to have a
coach by mid—December,” said
Senior Associate Athletic
Director Carol Sprague. “If it was
an ideal world, it would have
happened by September, but it’s
not an ideal world.”

Some people believe that pick-
ingthe “ideal” coach can deter-
mine whether the team is suc-
cessful or not.

“If they hire the right person, in
three to four years-they’ll see
results,” said‘ Homer Bozorg, the
girls soccer coach at North
Allegheny.

At the beginning of January,
Pitt named Roland Sturk head
coach of the team.

Sturk was formerly the head
coach at Regis University, a
Division 11 school in Denver, Co.
He was named the National
Soccer Coaches’ Association’s
regional coach of the year in 1994
after guiding the Rangers to a
second—place finish at the NCAA
Division II Championships.

This is the second time Sturk,
47, will be coaching a team
through its inaugural season. He
did the same thing at Regis,
building the team into a con-
tender in six seasons, and that
was a major reason he landed the
Pitt job. '

next thing Pitt needs is a team.

“We’re testing new waters,”
Sprague said. “There’s a lot of
soccer talent in Western Pa.”

Sprague said Pitt will probably
have open try-outs for those girls
who are already at Pitt and will
start recruiting high school
seniors immediately.

“They should spend a lot of
time looking for the best
prospects in the area,” Bozorg
said.

The recniiting process can be a
difﬁcult one in its own right. For
the most part, it’s up to the col-
lege to find the prospects who
will beneﬁt the team.

According to Sprague, some of ,

Pitt’s duties are following up with
questionnaires, watching videos,
going to high school and club
games, identifying players and
following them.

The prospects can come from
out—of—state or locally.

“I would say the first possibili-
ty would be to look locally,”
Bozorg said. “But they’ll proba-

bly bring girls from outside and.

mix them /with the local
prospects.” _

Another aspect of the recruiting
process worth considering is how
to convince a girl with soccer tal-
ent that Pitt is the best school for
her. Finding the right girl is not
half as hard as getting her to
come here. A . -

“Good players lookyfor the
school that offers them the most,”
Bozorg said. “If she’s‘ a good
player, you need to get her and
offer. her a scholarship.”

Although the scholarship plays
a big role in which school a per-
son will choose, Sprague said that
athletics should never be the most

~ important thing but that acade-

mics should be.
“The fun’s in the playing,”

 

Sprague said. “Athletics are as
natural to me as exhaling and
inhaling, but it should never be
the driving force behind the deci-
sion.” '

Another thing about recruiting
is the competition between the
schools to get the best players,
especially locally. ,

John Sumoski, the girls soccer
coach at Baldwin High School
and an assistant coach at
Carnegie Mellon, said there will
be a lot of tension between Pitt
and Duquesne.

“They’ll lose players to each
other, depending on where they
recruit from,” Sumoski said.

Luckily, Pitt will only have
Duquesne to compete with local-
ly for recruiting since CMU is
more academically oriented than
athletically according to
Sumoski.

One encouraging thing is that
the recruiting process won’t
always be so difficult.

“Recruiting gets easier once
you start winning,” Bozorg said.
“Once you start establishing
yourself in the conference, people
start looking for you.”

The ﬁrst few years are always
the most difficult when a new
teamis introduced into an already
established program. ’

“Like any new program,” Pitt
mens — soccer coach Joe

\ Luxbacher said, “they’re going to

suffer growing pains.”

Growing pains is one way to
put it.

“It takes time. In three or four
years, they’ll have a good pro-
gram,” Bozorgsaid. “A good
coach, rich program and -a few
years -— that’s all it takes.”

Although the general consen-
sus was that a new program
would be difficult and take time

Soccer

°Fr0m page 8
to be successful, there was a lot
of optimism about the women’s
soccer program.

“I think it’s great. It’s going to
be successful,” Sumoski said.
“No doubt in my mind. They
have the numbers and the loca-
tions.”

Bozorg used the success of
other Pitt sports programs to
make his predictions about the
success of the women’s soccer
team.

“I personally feel it’s a good
move by the University of

Pittsburgh,” Bozorg said.
“They’ve been successful at
other sports.”

Although instant success

would be welcomed, Pitt doesn’t ,
have outrageous expectations for ‘

the women’s soccer program.

For its first year, 1996-97, Pitt
will enter as an independent.
Sprague said Pitt will have a reg-
ular inter-collegiate preliminary
schedule for games, but it will
not be able to compete in the Big
East.

New teams have to compete
for one year before gaining eligi-
bility in the Big East
Toumament, said J aynes.

After competing for one year
in the conference, Pitt will be eli-
gible to compete in the Big East
Round Robin Tournament at the
end of the 1997-98 season.

“We’ll try to compete for the
tournament,” Sprague said. “We
just want to be competitive in the
Big East.”

Looking into the future,
Sprague said she hopes that Pitt
has a solidly established program
even though it will still be in its
infancy.

Column-—

-From page 6
faithful with one_1ast hope
—— the Big East tournament.
A good showing of two or
three wins may be the last-
second push the Panthers
need.

One small problem: if Pitt
does level out at its current
conference post, it will earn
a ninth seed in the tourna-
ment and play Miami in
round one, The winning _
team gets the honor of play-
ing Connecticut and a near-
certain thrashing when it
needs it the least.

There is, however, an
escape plan. If Pitt finishes
two seeds above its current
number nine, the Panthers
would play a weaker first-
round opponent and move
on to play Georgetown in
the second round. And we
all know what happens
when Pitt plays
Georgetown.

So with a little luck, a lot
of math and some good bas-

ketball, there is still the out-

side chance at meaningful
basketball in late March.
Or, with no luck and bad
basketball, it might be
tough to cash in those NIT
stamps. '
