Corrections

In yesterday's story, “SGB oversees
 mentoring,” The Pitt News
 incorrectly reported why_board
member Nila Devanath had voted
against naming Patrick Moroney
the elections chair. The judicial
committee is responsible for
appointing the elections chair,
and Devanath said she voted
against Moroney because of a
"harmless mix-up” earlier in the
process. The Pitt News regrets the
error. ‘

“One thingwe never comment
about is our security,” saidJeff Fin-
kelstein, president and CEO of the
federation. “That is our policy.”

Though it looks like a fortress,
the building is home to a philan-
thropic organization. g

“The United Jewish Federation
is the central  and com-
munity building organization for
the Jewish community of Pitts-
burgh,” said Finkelstein. “We do
offer some programming and di-
rect service to the community, but
that is not our primary function.”

One of the-federations func-
tions is in the area of ﬁnancial re-
source development An example

“We just reached our 2008 goal

The federation also holds spe-

Morelli gaining superstar status at Pitt l

Jesus frosh, page 1

“People would drive a little slower
and just look up at the biidge and see
Jesus’ and this group of guys waving
at them,” said Morelli.

Morelli has become a serni—celeb—
rity in Tower B. There’s even a sign
on the door to floor 13 saying, “W/el-
come to Floor 13, Home of Jesus.”
On his door is a dry-erase board with
messages from numerous students

proclaiming, “Jesus, we’ve found‘

you!” or “Jesus, come to floor 15 cuz
we are sexy, xoxo.”

Morelli doesn’t need to woo the
ladies with his “Jesus” attire. He has a
girlfriend at Villanova. But of course,
he’s always  to help out his
ﬁiends on floor 13 in the pursuit of
love.

“We’ve also got a  on
our floor,” said Morelli, “just in case
the whole ‘Jesus’  doesn’t do

eno to get people to visit the _

ﬂoor.

As more and more students take
notice of this doppelganger Mes-
siah, it begs the question of whether
Morelli will keep this going all year.
He has looked the way he does to-
day since the seventh grade, but he

believes that the hype will die down
eventually. He does not intend for
people to continue to come up to

’ him and follow him through the halls,

asking for autographs and photos.

However, religious groups could
propel him into the limelight —— for
good or bad reasons. \X’/hile some
Catholic and Christian groups might
ﬁnd .Morelli’s impersonation offen-
sive, Morelli reminds everyone that
he is not reallyJesus, nor is he 
to convince people he is

“I just look like him,” he said.
Morelli is himself a Catholic and
goes to church every week

Although Morelli doesn’t turn
water into wine or heal people with
the touch of his hand (although both
would be useful on a college cam-
pus), he does go out and plays cap-

ture the ﬂag and ultimate Frisbee on _

the Cathedral lawn. He’s just a nor-
mal student who doesn’t believe in
conservative haircuts However, he
might have performed a miracle by
uniting an entire ﬂoor of strangers in

in conjunction with the Hillel Jewish University

Perhaps the federations most important
function is to host programs, which aim to
strengthen the Jewish community as well as the
entire Pittsburgh community.

One of these programs is a community and

the community informed about topical issues as
well as getting them involved in advocacy.

Another such program is the federation’s

well as outreach programs to educate and in-
form people about Israel and celebrate Israel’s
accomplishments

The annualJewish—Israeli Film Festival is an-
other event that the federation helps to coordi-

“This event features  ﬁrom docu-

$750,000 worth of federal fund-
ing, county ofﬁcials will expand
the ‘surveillance camera network
by purchasing an additional 40
mobile cameras and connecting

: them together in a closed-circuit
1 network. The surveillance net-

work is expected to help in iden-
tifying criminals and keeping
people safe in urgent situations
like ﬂoods or ﬁres.

Such systems are vital law en-
forcement devices in many cit-
ies. When London experienced
the tragic July 2005 terrorist at-
tack, law enforcement ofﬁcials
used their surveillance system -
known as CCTV —-— to track the
perpetrators of the crime.

Indeed, statistics have shown
that surveillance systems are ef-
fective tools in deterring crime.
A recent report by the California
Research Bureau analyzed the
effects of Los Angeles surveil-
lance cameras in preventing or
resolving crime. According to
the report, the average monthly
crime rate on Hollywood Bou-
levard. decreased by more than
10 percent following the deploy-
ment of surveillance cameras.

County Emergency Services
Chief Bob Full said the cameras
will not only be used to monitor
high crime areas, but also to aid
emergency responders in dealing
with ﬂoods, helping them decide
on how to approach an area hurt
by flood waters.

EDITORIAL   

ra-happy county

The beneﬁts are plenty, but
the plan is not perfect. While
statistics show that these carn-
era networks can prevent crime,
problems can still arise. Take the
fatal mishap by the London po-
lice injuly 2005: 27-year-old Jean
Charles Menezes was shot sev-
eral times by police who, follow-
ing him by camera surveillance,
believed him to be a suspected
criminal.

The question of privacy has
also been left unanswered. Ac-
cording to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, county ofﬁcials have
not yet decided on whether they
will write a privacy policy about
how the surveillance system will
be used. _

The Post-Gazette also re-
ported that ThreatViewer will
incorporate county police, the
sheriff ’s ofﬁce, city and munici-
pality police departments and
private entities with surveillance
cameras. But county, ofﬁcials did
not specify what these private
entities are.

In fact, ofﬁcials have been
very vague concerning the de-
tails of the surveillance network.
As it stands, we do not know ex-
actly how the plan will be imple-
mented.

Will authorities be watching
the live feeds at all times? How
high is the camera resolution,
and will the resolution affect
how useful the system is in de-
terring crime? Are the tapes ac-
cessible to private entities or just
public ofﬁcials?

This plan has positives and
negatives but, if implemented
responsibly, the program should
help the county more than hurt
it. But county ofﬁcials have an
obligation to inform the public
more about the plan before it
goes into effect.

Pro Wrestling underappreciated

by Drew Singer
Cmztrzﬁuti/2_q Witt)!‘

I address you today as an em-
issary — an intermediate between
the naive and the nameless, an am-
bassador between the unrnindful
and the unsung and, above all else,
a medium between the disdainful
and the disrespected.

Hello, my name is Drew Singer,
and I am a professional wrestling
fan.

In a poll conducted by Interna-
tional Communications Research,
based in Media, Pa., professional
wrestling ranked as the second-
most hated sport in the world, sec-
ond only to dog ﬁghting.

While it is socially acceptable
to watch practically every show on
television, professional wrestling,
for some reason, remains a taboo.

It wasn’t until a past «episode of —

WWE Monday Night  when
the entire company shipped off to
perform live for soldiers serving

_ in Afghanistan, that I came to ap-

preciate just how much more pro-
fessional wrestlers have to endure
than, well, everyone else.
Professional wrestling is an act,
of course, but what isn’t? Twenty-
two million of you are watching

“CS1” on any given Thursday

 

evening, yet no one changes the
channel because the actors aren’t
actually crime scene investigators.
“The Sopranos” are no more Ma-
ﬁoso than I am, and your beloved
“Sirnpsons” aren’t even real peo-
ple. Regardless, wrestling remains
the sole scapegoat for fabrication
of television.

If watching a full-grown man
named “Sergeant Slaughter” feud
with someone masquerading as
“The Boogeyman” just isn’t your
cup of coffee, no one’s making you
watch — but why the disrespect?

Professional wrestling is an art.

_And I don’t mean that in a broad-

minded anything—can-be-consid-
ered-art sort of way. Professional
wrestling is actually a legitimate
performance art.

“Cornmedia dell’arte,” or “the
comedy of professional arts,” as
it translates from Italian, dates
back to the 15003. Back m the dayg
traveling teams of acrobats and
jugglers, acting as established char-
acters, would perform their crafts
through a humorous storyline.

It’s that storyline that seems to
scare away many would-be fans.
“It’s scripted,” haters remind me.

Truth. Wrestling is, without
exception, entirely, 100 percent
scripted. But it is by no means
fake.

That fallacy is the foremost
reason why wrestling receives so
little respect. While Sgt. Slaughter’s
Cobra Clutch, for example, might
not be as painful as said Boogey—
man might suggest, it is no illu-
sion. These acrobatic actors often
endure painfully real injuries, as
only so much can be done to safe-
guard their increasingly impressive
maneuvers.

Throughout history, progres-
sive thinkers -—- especially in the
arts — have received nothing but
neglect until well past their time.
Perhaps we should pause and ask
ourselves, are professional wres-
tlersyet another shunned avant-
garde, who are, simply put, ahead
of their time?

Who will usher our era into
the future? As we await the next
generation of John Lennons and
George Lucases, will we make the
same close-minded mistakes as our

_ forefathers?

If the next epoch of Platos and
Picassos happens to carry pseud-
onyms such as “Psicosis” and
“Scotty 2 Hotty,” we should never-
theless be prepared to accept these
gentlemen as pioneers. I sure know
that I am.

Diddy's newest recruit drops debut

by Samantha Stahl
For T he Pitt New

Metropolis: The Chase Suite
Janelle Monae _
\X/ondaland Arts Society/Bad
Boy Records
Rocks Like: Bjork meets Outkast

  

H Metropolis.‘ T/9e C/Jase Suite,
 t ' the first of four “suites”
to be released by Bad Boy
4’ I Records newcomer Janelle
Monae, -takes listeners on a
space .age—inspired voyage with strong vocals
and mood—lifti_ng dance tracks.

Inﬂuenced by the iPod generation’s ten-
dency to listen to playlists rather than albums,
Monae decided to release a se1:i_es of smaller
albums (suites), tatiiét than £tt11.1engt1t CD5,
wanting to give fans a continual fresh set of
music without overwhelming listeners.

 

Included in this ﬁrst set of tracks is “Vio--—

let Stars Happy Huntinglll,” the song respon-
sible for Monae signing with Bad Boy Re-

cords. P. Diddy himself came across “Happy .

Hunting,” a bubbly song with strong percus-

. sion, on Monae’s MySpace page and sent her

a message explaining his enthusiasm about
her sound. It wasn’t until Outkast’s Big Boi’s

(with whom she was previously acquainted)
conﬁrmation that Monae believed P. Diddy
was personally contacting her. Before long,
Monae, who grew up in Kansas but trans-
planted to Atlanta to take advantage of the
1:iCl'1 cultural scene, was signed to Bad Boy

p with full creative control.

It’s easy to see why P. Diddy would want
Monae on his label —— the girl deﬁnitely has
talent. However, it’s much harder to.believe

that she’s on the same list of artists as “Mak- —

ing the'Band” artists Danity Kane and Day
26. If you’relooking for just another Top-40
hip hop song to add to your weekend playlist,
this isn’t it. e ~- g

Monae manages to bring refreshing ele-

ments of electtonica and soul to her jams. In ’

her punky. style, ;she’s far quirkier than most
of her label mates. Outkast’s inﬂuence is ap-
parent in her faster-paced songs, where her

belting vocals combine with catchy beats

and will surely leave you  Her slower
songs, while far from being flops but certainly
not her best, resonate with Bjork’ss eccentdc

crooning. Her voice, frequently compared"

to Lauryn I-Iill’s, is simply beautiful, and'on_
' tracks like “Smile,” she showcases a chillingly
' operatic_ quality. , - V ‘

Monae’s'suite concept is an interesting

one and allows. her to experimenticreatively. '

On a 26-minute album, however, every sec-

ond is precious. Monae welcomes listen-
ers to the album with “The March of the
\X/olfmasters,” a cyber-spacey spoken piece
explaining the story of a character named
Cindi Mayweather: “Cyborg number 57821
/ Otherwise known as Cindi Mayweather /
Has fallen desperately in love / \With a hu-
man named Anthony Greendown / And
you know the rules / She is now scheduled

I for immediate disassembly.”

A little strange, no? Though Monae’s de-
sire to make a f_ully themed album is admi-
rable, this ﬁrst track comes off as a waste of

space.

Fortunately, _ Monae picks up the ‘slack
with tracks like “Sincerely, Jane,” where her
live band adds another dimension to the mu-
sic, the chorus of horns taking the album to a
much,more  level.‘The swanky track

adds a touch of glamour to the suite and will

bring listeners to their feet. She asks repeat-
edly, “Are we really living / Or just walking
dead now?” The question will  through
your head long after you’ve turned the album
off. v i .

~ Though some tracks take the cyberspace
theme too far," Metropo/zit.‘ The Chase Suzie cre-

ates promise for her future releases. Hopeful-

ly she’ll learn to take advantage of her shorter

I album format and skip the ﬁller to focus on

the soulful dance tracks she does best. ‘ I

Notebook: Wannstedt gets fas' disgustl

by Adam Littman
Senior Staﬁ’ W/riter

It’s not the end of the world, much less

the season, for Pitt football after its first game A, A

of the year.

But judging by the reaction to the Panthers’
27-17 loss to Bowling Green Saturday, it might
have been hard to tell that: As the fourth quar-
ter winded down, boos and chants of “Fire
Warmstedt” rained in from the crowd.

“We expected to go out there and play
good and win the game, so when people are
disappointed, they are going to express it,” said
Wannstedt during his weekly press conference
Monday. “And that’s part of the business, you
know. You’ve got to be able to handle that”

Wannstedt also said he explained to the
team that this you’re—only—as—good-as—your-
last-game theory is prevalent in sports among
fans, and it’s best to just continue to focus on
the team’s next game.

“When things are good, it’s good,” said

‘ Wannstedt. “You’re going to get a lot more
"recognition than probably what you deserve,

I i by Pat Mitsch

and when  are bad, it goes the other way.
It’s all part of the game.”
Watmstedt even went as far as to say the

fan reaction to the game was “probably justi-

ﬂed.”

A win at home against Buffalo this week
wouldn’t just even out Pitt’s record but would
also help renew the fans’ hope after starting
off a season of high expectations with a loss.

Ready to run

The Panthers’ top offensive player last
year was running back LeSean McCoy, who
finished the first week with 71 rushing yards
on 23 attempts and one touchdown and live
receptions for 45 yards.

LaRod Stephens-Howling, the senior run-
ning back, also finished with 71 yards on the
ground on only seven attempts. P 5

“Nothing surprises me with LaRod. I’ve
been his biggest fan for four years now,” said
Wannstedt. “He’s a heck of a player.” _

Stephens—Howling only it had one rush-
ing attempt in the second half of last week’s
game, which Watmstedt said was partly be—l
cause the team was trying to get McCoy hisl
touches, as well. '

“There’s only one football,” said Wannst-
edt.

Wannstedt said he expects the Panthers to
continue to run the ball instead of trying out
a spread offense.

“We go with no backs and throw the ball,
we do some of those things,” said Wannstedt.

« Albany 2, Pitt 1

The Pitt men’s soccer team

opened its 2008 regular season
with a 2-1 loss to Albany Friday
(it the Robert Morris University
“i?Tournament. It was Pitt’s inau-
 ral entry in the Robert Morris
. niversity Tournament,’ which
-as being played in Moon Town-
4‘ ship.

 

1-: I

_i Claudio Dantas of Albany put

his team on the board in the 39th

_}-minute of the game after a nice

pass from Iolos Jankovic. Jank-
ovic saw Dantas streaking from
“the left side, put the ball in front
of him then watched as the Alba-

33)’

  junior chipped it into the net.

.. ., .. r-~ 3.-s

 Pitt oalkee er Eric Barnes
3 8 _P

—made a nice effort charging at
‘Dantas, but he couldn’t prevent
the goal.

I Dantas scored his second goal
of the game in the 49th minute
— right at the start of the second

half.

After a shot taken by Al-
bany forward Don Johnson was
stopped by Jordan Marks, Dantas
tracked down the rebound and
put away a point—blank header to
extend Albany’s lead to 2-0 in the
game.

Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher
didn’t blame the defense and said
that Pitt just caught some unlucky
breaks in the game. He added that
the players were playing hard on
both sides of the ball.

Pitt freshman "Sam Luffy put a
dent into the lead when he scored

V in the 83rd minute after stealing

the ball from an Albany defender.
Luffy rocketed a shot from 25
yards out that went off another
Albany defender, giving the goal-
keeper no chance of blocking the
shot.

Albany out-shot Pitt 13-12 in
the game. Pitt gave opportunities
to a platoon of goalkeepers as
Barnes played the first half, while
Marks played the second half.
Barnes made two saves, while

Marks added with three saves.
Luxbacher was disappointed
in the amount of quality chances
Pitt squandered in the game, say-
ing his team needed to capitalize
on some of the 12 shots it had.

Pitt 1, Rider 0

After a tough outing against
Albany, the Pitt men’s soccer
team notched its ﬁrst victory of
the young season while facing
Rider on Sunday, 1-0. It was the
second game Pitt played in the
Robert Morris University Tour-
nament in Moon Township.

E.]. McCormick scored in the
ﬁfth minute to give the Panthers
the lead. From there, nothing
changed.

McCormick scored after he
collected a shot taken from Matt
Baker from 30 yards out. McCor-
rnickcapitalized on the rebound,
ripping a shot into the net from
16 yards out.

It was McCormick’s seventh
career goal for the Panthers and

Baker’s ﬁfth career assist. The 1-0
win by Pitt was its ﬁrst shutout in
22 matches, with the last being a
1-0 victory over Georgetown in
2006.

Marks started at goalkeeper

for the Panthers and made one

save in the ﬁrst half. Luxbacher
subbed Marks out at halftime as
Barnes started the second half
and made four saves. 1

Pittsburgh dominated Rider in
terms , of scoring opportunities,
out-shooting Rider 17-6.

One ‘concern Luxbacher had
of the game was once again Pitt’s
inability to capitalize on a mul-
titude of scoring chances. Lux-
bacher said that Pitt could have
easily scored more than one goal
in the game and was walking a
thin line preserving a one-goal
advantage.

\With the victory, Pitt finished
second place in the four-team
tournament. Albany was crowned
champion after winning both of
its games.

Albany’s Dantas was named

tournament MVP, leading all‘
players in scoring with two goals.
Pitt players Luffy, Ryan Brode
and Conner Malone were named
to the all-tournament team.

Overall, Luxbacher said he(
was happy with Pitt’s perfor— 

mance over the weekend.

Luxbacher added that Pitt is a
fairly young team and lacks a con-
sistent scorer or a go-to guy, like
many other teams have. But he
said he feels, as though the team
has good leadership and hopes
to clinch a berth in the Big East
Tournament this year.

Pitt plays again Thursday, Sept.

4. It will be playing at Duquesne“?

and kickoff is set for 7 p.m.
Duquesne is coming off a

successful weekend at the West

Virginia University Classic.

‘Duquesne won its ﬁrst game of

the season while playing Bing-

’ hamton Friday.

It followed that game up with a
scoreless draw on Sunday against
No. 15 West Virginia, a game that
went into double overtime.
