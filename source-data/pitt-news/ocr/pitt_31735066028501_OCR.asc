Med library becomes
student friendly

Hillary Stevenson
Staff Wrlter

Students using the medical library will no

longer need to look for a place to sit or hunt for a
copier. A grant has helped the library expand their
seating, their collection and increase the number
of copiers students can use.
, University officialsannounced last Tuesday
that the library has received a $125,000 Maurice
Falk Medical Fund grant to aid in expanding and
renovating the Maurice and Laura Falk Library of
the Health Sciences. The project should be com-
plete by the end of the year, which is also when
the library’s 40th anniversary celebration will be
held.

According to Patricia Mickelson, director of
the health-sciences library system, the grant will
help put the finishing touches on a project that
began in August. She declined to comment on the
cost of the total project and added that additional
funding comes from the University. ‘

Telefact answers anything students ask

If you needed to know that the
Cathedral was built from 114,000 bricks,
has 2,259 windows and 743 steps, and
bears 278,784,000 blades of grass on its

lawn, all you would have to do is pick up ‘

the phone and dial.

Somewhere looming over campus is
the ultimate source. Telefact, or 4-FACI‘
as it’s more commonly called, was estab-
lished by the University in 1990 as a
resource for students to be able to obtain
quickly and easily almost any bit of infor-
mation they needed to know.

Since then, it has become, a valuable
part of the majority of Pitt students’ lives.

. When you dial 4-FACI‘ between
noon and 9 p.m. Monday through
Saturday or between noon and 6 pm. on
Sunday, a phone operator will offer you an
answer to almost any question you can
throw at him

"The only thing we don't give infor-
mation on is homework, health related
questions, legal advice and song lyrics.
That's for legal reasons," said Paul
Szoboda, Telefact’s assistant coordinator.

According to workers at‘ 4-FACI‘,
most calls are requests for phone numbers,
driving directions, and hours of various
facilities on and off campus.

"We also receive a lot of trivia ques-

tions, mainly pertaining to sports and

entertainment," said Yander.

Working diligently, Yander and his
fellow fact-ﬁnders ﬁeld questions from all
over the nation.

"We get calls from alurrmi throughout
the country wanting to know information
about the University, as well as from peo-
ple in the Pittsburgh community’ calling
with questions about proper grammar and
movie times," said Yander.

The 4-FACI‘ center is headed by stu-
dent coordinator Keith McMellen and
staffs about 20 students. Due to the unique
demands of this job, not just anyone can
work there.

Initially, applicants must pass a 60-
question exam aimed at measuring an
individual's resourcefulness, a survival
skill that 4-FACI‘ phone operators must
possess. -

"You have to be ready to deal with
any kind of question," says one senior
fact-ﬁnder, who wished to remain anony-
mous.

Crowding the shelves inside the 4-
FACI‘ headquarters are all kinds of books.
Among them: alrnanacs, dictionaries,
cookbooks, "Star Trek" trivia guides, a
Spanish dictionary, a chemistry book and
a Bible. .

"We do use most of them," Yander
admits.

The 4—FACI‘ers also have complete
access to the intemet, as well as a custom-

Young Pitt debating teanr lands
in finals at recent tournament

James Maude

.For The Pltt News

It’s no surprise that college stu-
dents love to argue. Apparently, Pitt
students are some of the best stu-
dents at winning these arguments,
though. -

One of the William Pitt Debating
Union’s teams came away from last
weekend’s King's College
Invitational Tournament in Wilkes-
Barre, Pa., having reached the final
match of a national-policy-debate
tournament. '

The junior debate team, consist-
ing of sophomore Brendan Delaney
and freshman Mark DeNardis, won
three of its six preliminary rounds. It
progressed through three elimination
rounds to the final match, which it
lost to Liberty University.

Three notable victories came at
the expense of Cornell University,
Mary Washington College and
Duquesne University.

"Liberty University is our new
nemesis. We've got their number —
we'll get them next time, we're sure
of that," said Assistant Coach
Maxwell Schnurer.

The national-policy-debate topic
for this semester is "Resolved: The
U.S. federal government should sub-
stantially increase its security assis-
tance to one or more of the following
Southeast Asian nations: Brunei,
Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam."

Gordon Mitchell, the director of
the team and also an assistant com-
munications professor, said the team
has been practicing hard since the
end of August, and because of this,

its members are doing well.

"Mark's performance was
remarkable, no doubt about it, con-
sidering he's only had limited debat-
ing experience in high school and is

Mitchell. ‘

Of Brendan's performance,
Mitchell stated it was a breakthrough.

"He finished fourth out of 64 indi-
vidual debaters,” he said. “This marks
his arrival as a major power in our
debating district."

Mitchell noted that Delaney and
DeNardis were both competing
against college teams with one to two
years experience at major tourna-
ments.

Additionally, two other junior-
team debaters, Chris Burdick and Eric
English, won three out of seven pre-
liminary matches at a tournament
hosted by the University of South
Carolina last weekend.

The two varsity debating teams -
made up of Almas Sayeed and Lisa
Corrigan, and Philip Elwood and
Andrew Stangl — won three out of

seven and two out of seven matches,
respectively, at the tournament.

Although these figures may not
seem that impressive, Mitchell noted
that Elwood and Stangl were first-
time freshman debaters, and that the
opposition at the tournament was
exceptionally strong.

Researchers say commercials aired
during World Series are violent

Across the Nation

CHICAGO —— Shootings, stabbings and
burning bodies-

Sound like a horror show? A new
study says it’s actually what was depicted
in some television commercials aired dur-
ing last year’s World Series.

Researcher Dr. Charles Anderson
says a child could have seen 14 overtly

- violent commercials while watching one

World Series game.

Anderson analyzed 15 baseball
games on ESPN, NBC and FOX. More
than two-thirds of the violent commercials
were TV promotions, and almost one—ﬁfth
were ads for big-screen movies.

Anderson’s study, published in the
Journal
Association, notes that the new TV rating
system does not include commercials and
that violent commercials should be a topic
in discussions on TV violence.

NEW YORK — 'Tl1ey’re not endorsing
homosexual activity, but U.S. Catholic
bishops are urging parents not to reject
their gay children.

In a pastoral letter, the bishops say
homosexual orientation is not freely cho-
sen and that God doesn’t love anyone less
simply because he or she is a homosexual.

They’re advising parents of gay chil-
dren to put love and support for them

of the American Medical 0

ahead of church doctrine that condemns
homosexual activity. The bishops say par-
ents must not reject their gay children in a
society full of rejection and discrimina-
tion.

The document was approved by the
administrative‘ board of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops early in
September and released Tuesday.

The letter still does not abandon
Catholic doctrine. It states clearly that sex-
ual activity between sarne-sex partners is
immoral. It does, however, draw a distinc-
tion between homosexual orientation and
sexual activity.

VANCOUVER, Wash. —— A party of
three left a Washington state bartender a
$30 tip. But that’s not all the money they
left behind.

The bartender says she found a
leather bag containing $60,000. The bar-
keep says she thought she smelled pot and
decided to open the bag. But inside was
another type of green — stacks of hun-
dreds, frfties, and twenties.

The restaurant manager called -the
Vancouver Police. A lawyer has told oﬂi—

resident's
clau ter should
not e off-limits

for journalists s

Jesse Oxfeld was ﬁred from The Stanford Daily stu-
dent newspaper for writing a column about new Stanford
student Chelsea Clinton. His editor in chief, Carolyn
Sleeth, had set a strict policy of not covering the presi-

The

- dent’s daughter, and she felt his column violated that pol-

icy. I
Her policy seemed to be designed for two purposes:
to keep writers from going “soft,” writing about every-
thing Chelsea does from dropping her books to dropping
a class, and to try to allow the girl to lead a “normal” life

I at that school.

While we understand and respect the editor in chief ’s
effort to enforce an ethical standard, it is a ridiculous one,
and it is a completely unprofessional policy. While she
may be trying to be a responsible journalist, her actions
are hardly responsible and certainly not journalism.

Chelsea is never going to live a nonnal life at
Stanford. From the moment her father paraded her up on
stage to wave at the crowds, she was destined to live in the
spotlight for as long as he held ofﬁce. People forget that
living in the media is her normal life. Everywhere she
goes, she will be stared at and talked about like nobody
else at that institution. Pwple will take an interest in her.
You can’t blame the media for that It’s human nature, and
if it’s anybody’s fault, it’s her dad’s.

The policy of not covering her disregards the fact that
Chelsea Clinton is newsworthy by virtue of being Chelsea
Clinton.

Now, we don ’t mean that Chelsea should be followed
day and night like the late Princess of Wales. We do mean
that doing a feature on Chelsea, or interviewing her for the

paper would not be out of line. In fact, it might make for A

interesting reading. As long as photographers aren’t giv-
ing chase on bicycles trying to get photographs of her
making out with whomever she is dating, then writing
about her is not bad journalism.

It would be bad journalism to ignore her.

Even. if Oxfeld’s column was gratuitous coverage of
Chelsea (it was actually about the media coverage of her
arrival), all his editor had to do was not run it. We do that
whenever something is deemed not newsworthy. Firing
Oxfeld was unnecessary and unprofessional, and as such
it was a perfect allegory for the poorly-thought-out “don’t
ask, don’t tell, don’t pursue” policy of that newspaper.

Don't flirt with girls half your age‘

lfI hear one more lame pickup
line from some “middle-aged” man
on the Pitt campus, I might scream.
Is there something about a college
atmosphere that leads people to mis-
takenly believe that they can greet
someone with a line like, “Hey,
baby, wanna come home with me?”
and actually get a friendly response?

After the third time I heard
someone say, “You look just like
my future ex—girlfn'end,” I started
keeping track of the pathetic come-
ons that so many people here at Pitt
seemtothinkareokay. I’marea-
sonably ‘friendly person. I’m per-
fectly willing to talk to anyone who
just says something normal. For
instance, what’s wrong with simply
saying hello? Creative isn’t neces-
sarily good, and most people don’t
even manage the creative part of it.
They just think they do.

I think the biggest problem is
thattherearesomanypeoplein
their late 20s and early 30s who try
to approach college students. Why
don’t these people stop and think?
Okay, here are a few guidelines for
those who are apparently incapable
of knowing when to try and when
not to:

-1.Youaretoooldiftheperson
you are trying to pick up is four or
more years younger than you are.

- 2. You are way too old if you
remember when Kermedy got shot.

- 3. You are too old and you know
it if your usual greeting is, “Hello,
little girl. Would you like to talk to
me?” The answer to this question
should always be “No.”

0 4. You are way too old if you have
kids older than the girl you’re trying
to pick up. If you’re competing with

your son for dates, it’s time to look
for older playmates.

Hopefully, these rules will help
out the age—irnpaired. Do not
assume, however, that even if none
of the above rules apply speciﬁcally
to you, you are safe. Remember,
statutory rape is a crime punishable
by imprisonment.

Another thing about stupid
pickup lines: Do you really want to
be involved in any way with a girl
who is willing to come home with
you, a complete stranger, just on the
strength of your line, which is prob-
ably something like, “Hey, nice
shoes. Wanna sleep with me?”
Anyone. who responds well to a
comment like that has problems, as
well as something nasty and conta-
gious.

Among other things that don’t
work, or if theyrdo, shouldn’t, is the
howling-animal approach. I thought
that most people would have real-
ized this by now, but I guess not.
Coming on to someone as if she’s in
heat and you’re a dog is not a good
thing. I’ve seen lots of females
doing this as well. .

Beggingisalsoabadthing. If
youare sohardupfordatesthatyou
need to beg, it’s time for you to take
a good, hard look at yourself and
your life. There is something called
pride, and everyone should have
some. Asking is okay; whining is
not. If you’re in doubt about which
one you’re doing, look at the person

- you’re talking to. Are they looking

around desperately, hoping to ﬁnd
someone who will help them escape
ﬁorn you, the maniac who’s been
talking for a good 40 minutes now
and won’t let up any time soon? If
so, it’s time for you to give up.
Abasic truth here is that trying

work out unless you truly are a
funny and creative person. If not,
you come up with lines like, “Are
youagoodgirlorabadgirl?”I
know someone who was asked this
question twice. This might be a
marginally acceptable question
from someone in the same age
bracket, but once again we go back
to aged men trying to pick up
teenagers. When someone your
father’s age asks this, it has over-
tones of . .. well, let’s not go into all
that.

Brief side comment: Although
“I’m so drunk” may be the mating
call of the Southern belle, when
coming from someone who is vom-
iting on the ground, it’s not excep-
tionally appealing. Trying to make
new friends when drunk rarely
works. Another minus about this is
tl1atifyouaretl1atdrunkbutsorrie-
how do manage to get the person’s
phone number, you won’t remem-
ber it .

One last comment I’d like to
make on this subject: Some of you
out there seem to have taken the
phone commercials a little too seri-
ously and far too literally. When
they say “Reach out and touch
someone,” they don’t mean reach
out and touch someone. It’s a ﬁgu-
rative thing. Walking up to
unknown people and touching is not
a very good idea. For one thing, if
I’m« the person you’re reaching out
to touch, you’re likely to get an
elbow in your midsection or a knee
in your groin, depending on how
involved in the touching you were

trying to get. Keep -your hands to

yourself.

Integration, not separation, is key to liberal education

It’s eight—thirty in the morning —
time for Statics and Dynamics. Statics, as
in lying in bed for another eight minutes
while the snooze runs out on the alarm
clock, and Dynamics, as in getting out of
bed and throwing on what passes for
clothing and getting to class. Class, as in
Statics and Dynamics. Confused yet?

Nine o’clock classes are second only
to eight o’clock classes in terms of tortur-
ous mornings. But that’s not the main
problem with my class.

That dubious distinction belongs to
— hate to say this, but it’s true —- the
incredibly boring nature of the subject.
Sure, there may be some people who
enjoy playing with vectors, and I don’t
have a problem with that. It’s just that
good old statics ‘n dynamics is about as
dry as it gets. But it certainly isn’t the only
one, or even the worst in this regard. That
honor goes, without any hesitation or
debate, to the various mathematics class-
es in which I have managed to ﬁnd
myself. This may come as a surprise, but
it really shouldn’t; I know very few peo-
ple who perform mathematic manipula-
tions for amusement or to pass a few
hours while the mainframe 111118 through
the latest program for ﬁnding the largest
prime.

But I’m not here to simply complain
about classes, although at this particular
moment in time tl1ere’s nothing I’d like to
do better (and yes, that strikes me as being
a problem).

I’m here to complain about the utter
lack of integration between "classes and
almost complete non-existence of any
attempt to rectify this. I ﬁnd myself leam—
ing in thermodynamics what I went over
just a few months ago in chemistry. I get
this terrible sense of deja vu every time I
see the principles of vector algebra‘ laid
out on the chalkboard and remember that
the classes I had before this which
involved vectors never stopped to explain
them, and the ones that explained vectors
never used them.

That’s what the classical school sys-
tem is all about — separate classes about
“separate” disciplines — the numbers in
one place and the letters in another and
the colors and squiggly lines in a pile
somewhere over there. And ne’er the
twain shall meet. Sure, you always hear
the words “mu1ti-disciplinary,” “diversi-
ty,” and “enrichment” being touted and
ﬂouted and generally bandied about. But
it usually means accounting with business
management, or computer engineering
with mathematics. We just love to split
our-selves into little right-brain, left—brain,
and no-brain groups. Even within a disci-
pline there is very little integration

between different areas. Students are
never taught to use the principles they
learned in chemistry in their design class-

es. However, the split is much wider ~

between the humanities and the scientiﬁc
disciplines. This manifests itself as the (I
am sure unintentional) stiﬂing of creativi-
ty in the disciplines generally considered
to be analytical, and the rejection of rea-
soning in the areas where creativity is
supposed to reign supreme.

I can count on a single hand the num-
ber of people in my very sizable design
class who can sketch with any reasonable
degree of skill. “Why should we be able
to?” they ask. “We aren’t artists.” Indeed.
These are the people who will be design-
ing many of the things in your future,
from toasters to cars. I highly doubt that
many people in my ﬁlm class can ﬁnd a
second-order derivative, or take the cross-
product of two vectors.

Although I am all in favor of the “to
each his own” school of thought, I have to
admit that a little more, uh, “forced diver-
sity” might not be a bad thing. Otherwise
we may just end up with a whole lot of
cars that look like something even an
‘80’s GM executive would be ashamed of
and tons of sculptures made out of plas-
ticine. I’d rather not think about that,
though.

Why is it so difficult to get the kind of
diverse training that I want at this

University? '

I love the reaction I get when I tell
people. I’m majoring in both engineering
and ﬁlm. It’s really not that weird. I just
happen to like technical stuff as well as
creative stuff, and you’ll know if you’ve
ever tried that the only way to take ﬁlm
classes at this University is as a ﬁlm
major. But it took me six months of run-
ning around in circles and playing with
forms to ﬁgure that out. Why does it have
to be so hard?

In the meantime, my engineering
classes are killing me. I want to solve
problems that have never been solved and
design things that have" never been
designed, but if you’re in engineering
you’ll know that isn’t what I’m doing. My
film class never gets into any technical
details, either, which would actually be
useful, as opposed to artistic or whatever.

Thanks to convention and .what
comes perilously close to intellectual
snobbery, my liberal arts classes are far
less useful than they might be, and my
“hard sciences” classes are fantastically
boring. Great.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I have 57
pages of problems to do before class
tomorrow. Why do I have this feeling that
this won’t be fun?

Owls can ’t catch
a break in the
tale of the tape

In 1995 the Pitt Panthers visit-

ed Veterans Stadium in
Philadelphia, and left the Temple
Owls with their first—ever win in
the Big East Conference, 29-27.

At that point the Owls had been
in the conference six years, and
Temple was by far the Big Least.
But Pitt played the role of the

understanding, compassionate
inner-state foe and handed the
game away.

Since then, neither of the teams
has really done anything to end
their suffering. That is, until now.

Fine, Temple is 1-4, but it has-
n’t been the doormat game in and
game out this season.

For the first time in a long time,

Pittsburgh needs this game to keep '

its bowl hopes alive.

true. I’m not leafing through the St.

now. I

gibberish is premature, but a man

Veterans Stadium.

Let’s take a look at the tape:

Quarterback: -

Temple would probably like to
be able to play two QBs against
Pittsburgh’s suddenly swarming
defense, but the last time I
checked, that isn’t allowed. I will
keep you posted, though, on any
last-minute changes.

Pete “The Stud” Gonzalez was
dubbed by Sports Illustrated two
weeks ago as one of the top per-

He’s a linebacker

“I don’t care about an
interception. I’d rather just
hit somebody,” said smiling

senior strong safety Curtis.

McGhee.

Last year, McGhee was

able to escape his safety shell
and play the last ﬁve games
of Pitt’s 4-7 season at outside
linebacker because of team
injuries. This year he is still
called a safety, but more

often than not he looks like a
linebacker.
At 5’11” and 180

pounds, McGhee’s size is
more suited for the defensive
backﬁeld, but he’s been mak-
ing plays in Panther oppo-
nents’ offensive backﬁelds.
He has three tackles for loss-
es and two quarterback hur-
ries to go along with his 44
tackles, which ranks him

' third on the team behind Phil

Clarke and Ernest Coakley
-— both linebackers.

“He’s done everything
that we’ve asked of him and
more,” said Pitt’s defensive
coordinator Larry Coyer.
“He’s exempliﬁed what this
program is trying to do.”

In the new Mad Dog

defensive scheme, McGhee \

plays just four yards off the
ball and to the strong side of
the offensive formation.‘
Pitt’s new defense is geared
towards stopping the run and
putting pressure on the quar-
terback — two of McGhee’s
favorite pastimes. _

“In this defense, every-
one just goes for the ball, and"
I love that.” said McGhee. “I
played more off the line last
year, and I didn’t get to make
as many plays.”

He led the team in tack-
les last year, but unfortunate-
ly, he was making those
stops 10 yards down ﬁeld

The Pitt Panthers have prepared near-
ly two weeks for the Temple Owls. The
game is still two days away. at

And the Panthers, according to Head
Coach Walt Harris, still have work to do.

An injury to defensive tackle Frank
Moore — who has four tackles for loss and
one sack in four games this season — has
forced the Panthers to further shuﬁle their
front, adding redshirt junior Kenny
Pegram to the mix.

Freshman Jeff McCurley and junior
Marlin Young are also newcomers to the
starting defense, replacing Jason Soboleski
and Calvin Robinson, respectively. Left
end Julian Graham, currently leading all
Pitt linemen in tackles, is the only returning
starter from the 21-17 win versus 

Harris called Moore his “top defen-
sive lineman,” adding that “in today’s
game, those are the hardest guys to come
by.”

The coach focused his comments on
Moore’s leadership, and on the conﬁdence

his teammates have developed in him over
the course of the season. He said this lead-
ership would be missed, especially by the
rookie McCurley. ,
Pitt’s substitute-ﬁlled defense will face

a Temple offense that is noted for its quar— F

terback rotation. Sophomore Kevin
Harvey will start behind the center, with
junior Pat Bonner seeing time in relief.

Harvey is an option quarterback;
Bonner is a drop-back quarterback By
switching signal-callers, Harris feels the
Owls will dictate the positioning of Pitt’s
defense. I .

_ “You have to play according to who’s
in there,” said Harris, who evaluated
Harvey as a potential recruit while at Ohio
State.

The coach did not say which quarter-
back the Panthers would rather seeunder
center, but did note that Harvey’s rushing
ability “can embarrass you.” ~

Jackson. First-time starter and converted

Despite Eric Kasperowicz’s impres-
sive showing against the Hurricanes on
Homecoming, redshirt junior E.C.
Varoutsos returns to his post at outside
linebacker. Ernest Coakley gets the other
outside post, and will look to add to his
team-leading four sacks at the expense of
either Harvey or Bonner.

While the defense shined two weeks
ago versus Miami, the Pitt kicking game
struggled. Harris, at his Monday press con-
ference, told the media that both place-
kicking and punting would be stressed at
practice throughout the week, but after
Wednesday’s session, the problems
seemed far from solved

‘Today, the special teams didn’t do
their job very well,” said Harris, whose
punters and kickers have been 
in workouts this week. “Every day is a new
experience for us.”

THE PITT NEWS

Resurgent Owls could plague Panthers

Geoff Moak
Staff Wrlter

Before you start laughing at
the Temple Owls, you may want
to think about them for a minute.
They’ve become a nemesis of
the Pitt Panthers lately.

It took the Owls four sea-
sons in the Big East before they
won their first conference game.
That was a 29-27 win in 1995
against Pitt. Temple almost beat
Pitt again in 1996,. but the
Panthers staged a huge fourth-
quarter comeback to win 53-52.
After that game, Temple Head

, Coach Ron Dickerson walked

into the press conference and
announced that he was resign-
ing. It’s all starting to have the
makings of a full-ﬂedged rival-
ry.

That may be going a bit too
far. After all, Temple has had
only one winning season since
1979, when Jimmy Carter was
president, the Bee Geestopped
the music charts and the Owls
went 10-2.

There’s a very real chance
of all that changing this year.
The Owls are ﬁnally no longer a
laughingstock. True, they are 1-
4, but they’ve saved their best

games thus far for Big East
opponents. They shocked
Boston College in their Big East
opener this season and took the
conference’s best team, Virginia
Tech, to the limit two weeks ago
before losing by 10.

Temple’s strongest position
on offense is tight end, which
means you can expect to see a
different type of offense than the
high—powered one that came to
Pitt Stadium last year. For one
thing,.most of the players from
last year’s offense are gone.

Most of the Owls’ offensive
production last year came from
senior quarterback Henry Burris
and his favorite target, senior
receiver Van Johnson. Last year,
Burris threw for nearly 500
yards against Pitt. Burris’
replacement this year, Pat
Bonner, won’t be putting up
those kind of numbers, but he is
a capable leader of the offense.

Running back Rarnod Lee is
the man primarily responsible
for picking up some of the
offensive slack. Lee was the
Owls’ leading rusher last season,
racking up 540 yards despite not
starting any games.

Temple’s defense is young.
Seven starters from last year’s

squad are gone, leaving holes
that need to be ﬁlled by inexpe-
rienced players. Ironically, it’s
been the defense that has kept
the Owls from being blown out.
If you don’t count the 52-10
drubbing at the hands of Penn
State, Temple has allowed just
over 25 points per game.

Much like Pitt’s squad,
Temple’s defense has proved it
can come up with the occasional
big play to win a game. A
turnover late in the fourth quar-
ter against Boston College
sealed Temple’s only victory
this year. That’s a stark contrast
to last year, when teams like Pitt
and Washington State regularly
staged late-game comebacks to
beat the Owls.

But the fact of the matter is,
Temple is still near the bottom
of the Big East in many statisti-
cal categories, not to mention
the standings. Temple’s scoring
offense and scoring defense are
currently ranked seventh in the
eight—team Big East.

Coach Dickerson has adopt-
ed “It’s possible” as the slogan
for his program. “It” may be
possible, but whatever it is, it
still -looks a long way off for
Temple.

The Panther coaches put And McGhee appreciates

McGhee in a position to make
plays, and so far he has. He is
often unaccounted for when
he blitzes, giving him chances
to tattoo opposing players.

In Pitt’s win over Miami,
the safety had one of the
biggest plays that went unno-
ticed in all the hoopla of the
21-17 win. Late in the third
quarter, after Pitt had just
botched a ﬁeld goal try that
would have given it the lead,
Miami took over with the ball
at its own 37-yard line.

On second and 10, the
Hurricanes handed off the
ball, and the runner was
immediately hit by Coakley.
Then, McGhee continued the
pounding of the ball carrier
with a knockdown blow that
shot the ball onto the turf and
into the hands of defensive
back John Jenkins. The Pitt
offense took over at its own

23-yard line, and four plays»

later, Pete Gonzalez scram-
bled for the game-winning
touchdown.

“He’s just a tough kid
who likes to make plays,”
said Coyer. “I really appreci-
ate having him.”

the new coaching staff.

“This team is so much
more disciplined and together
than last year,” said McGhee.
“Everyone wants to improve
and get better. The coaches
are into it, and we’re into it.”

At this point in the inter-
view, McGhee motioned to
the players still on the prac-
tice ﬁeld 15 minutes after
everyone else has left.

“Last year, guys would
leave practice as quickly as
possible, but this year guys
are doing extra work to get
better,” said McGhee.

Off the ﬁeld, McGhee
seems at ease with himself.
He’s conﬁdent, but not cocky.
Before a game he is reserved,
just listening to music. But
once the game begins, his
chatter is non-stop.

“I’m crazy on the ﬁeld,”
said McGhee. “To play foot-

. ball, you have to be different.

You have to play like you’re
on something.”

McGhee is deﬁnitely on
something — a mission.

the big hit. That’s what I‘
like.” \

once again a sinking ship —- going
down despite some early signs of
life. No one but Kevin Walker has
caught a TD pass for the Owls this
year. Temple has thrown for more
yards as a team than Pittsburgh, but
it has played one more game than
the Panthers.

Advantage: Pittsburgh

Defense

I have made the decision to not
even compare the two defenses.

The records and points allowed
say enough. The Pittsburgh defense
clinched two of the Panthers’ three
victories this season, registering a
last-second interception against
both Houston and Miami. Four
players have over 40 tackles
already: linebackers Phil Clarke
(48) and Earnest Coakley (47), and
hard—hitting safety Curtis McGhee
(44).

Former Mr. Everything Darnell
Dinkins has settled into his role as a
quality free safety behind the quick
healer John Jenkins —— the Big East
Defensive Player of the Week two
weeks ago. The fifth-year senior
recovered a fumble that led to the
game-winning touchdown against
the Hurricanes, and intercepted a

Ryan Clement pass with 1:25 to go

in the game to seal the win.

All this came after knee surgery
early in the season. '

Temple did hold Virginia Tech
to 23 points, but a loss is a loss, and
it has the knack for racking those
losses up.

Add another win to the list this
week, and Panther fans, get ready
for the second—most obnoxious,
pompous fans in the world (behind
Penn State) to invade our.\campus
—— the followers of the 1-3 Notre
Dame Fighting Irish. See you next
week.

Thursday, 2 October 1997

Welcome to a tour of the United
States. We’re looking at Western teams
this week. The Southeastern Conference
had its day in the sun two weeks ago.
This week, the best destination is the Big

‘ 12, where there are two games pitting

top—25 teams against each other. On the
way out west, we need to make a few
quick stops.

Pitt at Temple (+6)

Temple has been one of the most
chronically bad teams in the country. In
one of many Panther lowlights last year,
Pitt was a one-point underdog at home
against Temple. In just one year, things
are back to normal between these two
teams. What’s “normal?” At least com-
pared to Pitt, Temple is bad once again.
Pitt fans fully expect a win over the
Owls. So do the Pitt players, and so do I.
Pitt 35, Temple 17 '

Iowa (+4 1/2) at Ohio State

Not long ago, Ohio State was tearing
up the Big 10 with the likes of Eddie
George, Bobby Hoying and Orlando
Pace. Now it’s Iowa’s offense that domi-
nates the conference, and the country so
far this year. Hawkeye quarterback Matt
Sherman is the Big 10’s top-rated quar-

THE PITT NEWS

Auburn, Stanford head up Moc1k’s week-six picks

outscored almost 20 Division I teams all
by himself. For the seventh-ranked team
in the country, Ohio State sure hasn’t
been impressive yet.

Iowa 24, Ohio State 13

Kansas State (+21) at Nebraska

Both of these teams have been beat-
ing the snot out of teams like Akron and
Northern Illinois. But the Coriihuskers
have also beaten Washington, and they
did so by running effectively. Nebraska
has run the option on offense for years.
You’d think by this time, somebody
would be smart enough to ﬁgure out how
to stop it, but nobody has. If Washington
cou1dn’t, Kansas State sure won’t. Still, if
Kansas State is half as good as it looks
against the chumps it played so far, it
should keep the game within a few touch-
downs.
Nebraska 35, Kansas State 20

 

impressive team in the country so far has
to be Texas A&M. As is the tradition in
the Big 12, the Aggies spent September
beating up on powerhouses Sam Houston
State, North Texas and Southwestern
Louisiana. So this makes statistics that
are as artiﬁcial as Spam. At least the
Aggies have looked good, which is more
than can be said for Colorado. The
Buffaloes struggled against Colorado
State and got pummeled against
Michigan. This is just one more ranked
opponent that they’re going to lose to.
Texas A&M 28, Colorado 24

Washington State at Oregon (+7)

Like most of the Pac 10, the Ducks
are pass—happy. Unfortunately, they just
don’t have the personnel to match up
with the Cougars and quarterback Ryan
Leaf. Washington State also has the con-
ference’s best pass defense, which would
make things difﬁcult. even if Oregon’s
offense was better. Besides, a team called
the Ducks has no business winning any-
thing anyway.

Washington State 45, Oregon 28

11

better than Stanford. Stanford’s history
and tradition don’t match Notre Dame’s,
but the game will be played in the future,
and right now, Stanford’s immediate
future looks a lot brighter than Notre
Darne’s.

Stanford 21, Notre Dame 10

Alabama at Kentucky (+6)

Kentucky has the marquis player
here, quarterback Tim Couch. But
Alabama has the better team. The offense
is led by some guys named Kitchens,
Alexander and Alexander, which sounds
more like a law ﬁrm than an offensive
backﬁeld. They get the job done, though,
which is more than Kentucky can say
about its offense besides Couch.
Kentucky does not run the ball, so if
Alabama shuts down the passing game,
the Wildcats are in for a long day.
Alabama 38, Kentucky 21

This week’s best bet:
Auburn at South Carolina (+7)

The South Carolina Gamecocks are
an utterly unremarkable team. They have

, a mediocre offense, a poor defense, and a

Notre Dame at Stanford (+1)
Knute Rockne’s Fighting Irish are
favored by one in this game. I say that

stupid nickname. Auburn is a national-
championship contender with a -solid
defense, an all-star quarterback, and

terback. Runnin back Tavian Banks, Texas A&M (+3 1/2) at Colorado because it’s absolutel crazy to even su - somethin to la for.
