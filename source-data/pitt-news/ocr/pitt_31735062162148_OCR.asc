Debate Surrounds Bio Text 3fUdentsRally Beltincl,  

BY LARRY PLATT

Cries of racism and McCarthy-
ism surround the use of a Biology
138 text, Ecosystem and Man.

Both Students for a Democratic
Society [SDS] and black studies
faculty have criticized the course’s
main text, Man and the Environ-
ment by Arthur Boughey. They
charge the book is, “scientifically
inaccurate in many places, expli-
citly racist and advocating a
solution to the "problems of
mankind not unlike the one Hitler
proposed in Mein Kampf.

The course's professor, Bill
Coffman’, supports the’ book,
calling it: “The only compre-
hensive book of human ecology,"
and condenms those making the
complaint for-"not being able to
tell the difference between discus-
sing and advocating -an issue."

The purpose of the course as
stated in the class description is to
give an “ecological view of man
conceptualizing the place of man in
his biological world."

According to Coffman, the book
proceeds from the assumption the

GREENSBURG, Pa. AP--Robert
W. Duggan, three-term district
attorney of Allegheny County was
found shot to death on the lawn of
his sprawling country home in
nearby Ligonicr early Tuedsay, just

hours before a federal grand jury '

indicted him for income tax fraud.
Authorities said the 48-year-old

world is overpopulated and some-
thing must be done to resolve the
demographic crisis. It reviews
proposed solutions, no matter how
controversial, that have thus far
been presented on population
control. Such topics include the
forced sterilization _of men and
women, and fertility control on a
regional basis.

In a letter to the Pitt News, the
SDS charged a “dangerous prece-
dent" would be set by permitting
the use of such a textbook. They
added: “Such ideas provided the
ideological base for the Nazi
movement in Germany and is
presently being used to justify such
policies as the proposed bill in
Ohio, which would sterilize welfare
mothers with more than 2 children,
the case of forced sterilization of 2
black women in Alabama, and
performing psychosurgery (labo-
tomies) on prisoners."

Coffman quoted some of the
same incidents to support using the
text. “We can't hide our heads in
the sand," he said. “These are
issues that are being dealt with
every day."

The book comparatively analyzes
the‘ suggested solutions, Coffman
said, adding he has offered his
accusers the opportunity to hold a
recitation refuting ' points they
deem disagreeable.

Dr. Charles Ralph, chairman of
the biology department, was
worried that a “dangerous prece-
dent" might be set. “We want to
be sure the rights of a ‘professor are

protected in terms of his right to ,,

select what*he thinks is the best
textbook, and the right to present
ideas, no matter how unpalatable
they are to the community," Ralph
said. a

Social Work Colleague  

BY DEBBIE POPP

Students in the Graduate School
of Social Work will give additional
input into’ the academic review of
fellow student Franklyn Wepner in
an informal meeting Monday with
Dr. David Epperson, Dean of the
Graduate School of Social Work.

Rumor within the School that the
Academic Review Committee

that Wepner be expelled were
confirmed by a reliable source.

Approximately 20 students wait-A

ed for an hour on the 22 floor of the
Cathedral yesterday to meet with
Epperson.
unable to see the Dean because of a
conflict in his schedule.

Student concern in the academic
review seems to center on personal
interest in the academic freedom of
Wepner and the School's profes-
sional integrity.

Wepner’s professional skills as a
social worker and consequently’ his
status as a student are being
questioned on three counts by two
professors.

These counts listed in a letter by
Wepner's faculty advisor, Alan

. Landy, to the dean on November’
19, 1973 include: .

1. His class behavior characterized

as disruptive and domineering’

when asking questions.

2. His capacity to use himself in an
interpersonal context in a drama
therapy workshop.

3. His resistance to making
essential changes in the use of self
to indicate readiness to enter upon
field work.

In response to these criticisms

‘Univ. Ham Radio Station Model Cities Aids Oakland, Hill 

Tronsmifs Personal Notes

BY RITA VITOLO

“Tell him I love him and I miss
him and I wish he would write soon
if he can...”

Beaming tender messages from
Pitt students, like this one headed
for Philadelphia, is the service

I . project of W3YI, the University’s

ham radio association.
The station promises to transmit,

‘ ' free of charge, any message of 40

words or less anywhere in the
5 continental United States. The
receiver need not have access to a

 ham radio set.

“‘What we do, is collect the
messages once a day, and then one
of our licensed members sends
them out. Say you’ve got a
message for Philly. - We make
> contact, with an‘ operator in the
- area, relay the message, he takes it
down, and then he calls up whoever
it’s intended for and reads it to
him,” said project’ director Bill
“Milus.

“We’ll transmit anywhere
cross-country or cross-state. Local
messages we can handle pretty

I easy, we can usually make direct

contact--and by local I mean Philly,
Penn State main campus, they’re
easy to. get; New York City,
so,metimes Boston. Otherwise we
have to go through nets--networks
that handle message transmis-

sions.”

A more difficult but more
personalized “phone patch”
hook-up, connecting the station's
message sending equipment with
the receiver’s telephone (and
by-passing Ma Bell's phone rates)
can be managed by calling the
station and arranging a transmis-
sion time, Milus said.

One of the oldest organizations
on campus, W3Yl began sending
messages before 1920, in the days
of Marconi’s wireless and “spark
gap” radio transmissions, without
the advantages of modern voice
communication.

Today the club numbers 28
members, about 60% licensed by
the Federal Communications Com-
mission [FCC] to operate amateur
radio. FCC and international law
prohibit transmitting from a
non-commercial set for personalior
club profit. '

“We can't and won’t charge,”
said Milus. “It’s a service and it’s
free. We're supported by student
funding, by the student activities

The Model Cities Program,
designed to aid lower income
families in Oakland and the Hill
District, relies heavily on citizen
participation, according to program
worker Charles Morrison.

“The program began in 1966 as a

branch of the Mayor’s office,” said‘

Morrison. “Originally it received
all-money from the Federal

aware of the pending indictment.

Duggan, a ﬂamboyant, jet-setter
whose terms in office had been
marked by his hardline stand on
crime and corruption, also was
under state investigation for
alleged violations of the state
election code’ during his 1971
re-election campaign.

When word of Duggan’s death
reached Harrisburg, Atty. Gen.
Israel Packel released the text of a
letter sent to‘ Duggan last week in
which Packel informed the county
prosecutor that the state was
initiating a civil action against him
to challenge his right to remain in
office.

The state probe grew out of a

Department of Housing and Urban
Development [HUD].”

The program has a built-in
clause giving it operating money
until 1975. The projects will then
have to rely on other funding,
according to Morrison. i

There are currently 23 operating
projects in Model Cities including:
--A Medical Training Employment
Program training residents in
paraprofessional fields such as
technicians, full health and dental
care at Montefiore Hospital on a
sliding scale, two drug prevention
programs, and free ambulance
service. i

‘ --A summer youth employment

service giving area youths summer
jobs. . ‘
--The Model Cities Mini-Bus
Project providing a 10 cent fare
reduction for the Atwood Street bus
and charging only a dime for the
Model Cities Loop bus.

Other projects include free legal

service, and a revolving loan and-.-

grant program for home owners.
Elections for Model Cities

Commisioners, the highest elected
office in the program, will be held
March 23.

“Most people don’t realize how
important the commissioners are,”
Morrison said. “All Federal
money, regardless of what for,
must be channeled through Model
Cities.”

There will be five seats up in the
Oakland area. Anyone living in the
area, including Pitt dormitory
residents, may run for the office,
providing they are 17 and can show
proof of residency. i

“All work done is first submitted
by proposals from citizens or
agencies and then cleared through
a citizen committee,” Morrison
said. “These groups include
Housing, Public Safety, Health and
Welfare, Employment and Eco-.

inomic Development, and Educa-
'tion.

“The citizens have all the say on
which projects are worked on,”
Morrison continued. “The selec-
tions are very important and we
neediresidents badly,” he said.

List Narrowed in Search

For New GSPIA Dean

Candidates for clean of the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs are expected
to be invited to Pitt to be
interviewed by the middle of
March, according to Associate
Provost Donald Henderson, chair-
man of the dean search committee.
Henderson described the re-
sponse to various University
queries as “enormous” and said
“ourwproblem will be narrowing the
list down.”_

Dr. William Dunn, a member of
both the GSPIA faculty and the
committee, said an initial list of 215
candidates has been narrowed to
20. “There has been some
controversy about the committee
being behind schedule, but I think
we’re moving at a satisfactory
pace,” he said.

“It’s an impressive list of‘

candidates we have so far including
a number of familiar names,”

Dunn said. He would not comment
on who the familiar people were or
why they were familiar.

After they narrow the candidate
list to ﬁve, the committee will
dissolve and the ﬁnal choice for
clean will be made by Chancellor
Wesley Posvar and Provost Rhoten
Smith. Both Henderson and Dunn
were conﬁdent they would have a
new dean by fall.

WPIC Clinic Capes with   

Couples’ Sexual Problems 

not yet consummated their mar- M

BY CARL UHLMAN

A new clinic treating couples
with sex problems is available at
the Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic (WPIC).

_ “For the problems we handle,
our program is better than
psychoanalysis, the only other
thing that would be available,”
said Carol Anderson, director of
WPIC’s Family Therapy Clinic.
“With psychoanalysis, it could be
years before the sexual problem is
reached."

At the Western Psych clinic, a
therapist team, consisting of one

_man and one woman, attempts to

determine the source of a couple’s
sex problem by having each

- member detail such tings as his sex

life and his perceptions of his
partner, Anderson explained.

The early stages of the program,

help thelipatient discover new

-awareness, texture, warmth and

mutual support with the partner,
she said. “At ﬁrst, intercourse is
prohibited, since we are trying to

’ break old habits.”

Eventually, special exercises are
assigned for correcting speciﬁc
problems, she said. .

Typical difficulties include pre

mature ejaculation, impotence, ,

non-orgasm, and vaginismus.

Timidity and inability to enjoy sex
are also problems, Anderson said,
adding, “Some patients had been
married four or five years and had

 

riage.’ ’

Treated couples also learn:
anatomy and human sexual, res-',
ponse. “Most people who come to _'

1’

.us lack information, Anderson

said. “They usually don't have l_f
physical or deep psychological-
problems.” 3

The clinic is modelled afteriial
successful program’ founded by 
William H. Masters and, .'

Drs.
Virginia Johnson in St. Louis,
where the clinic's waiting list is_

one-two years, according to Ander-

son. ~ '
The program lasts about ‘ two

weeks if daily sessions are held,

she said.

The fee for the clinic is $50 per‘

session, although some patients
who could not afford the full price
have been treated.

couple who can’t pay the fee, ‘we
have to have some who can.”

The clinic opened in January and 
employs seven part-time therapist ._
teams, including an advisor trained '

by Masters and Johnson.

Presently, the program can treat 10 ‘
couples at a time, Anderson said,‘-a '
and future plans include a full-time g

staff to handle more cases.

. Recent publicity has brought a‘. 
deluge of inquiries concerningsthe ‘
clinic, Anderson said, and the staff - ~
is trying to accept all interested 

couples.

,Rationing.' A Naive Solution

BY DAVID LYNCH
Certain politicians and journalists

‘I,’ claim that gasoline rationing, in
, conjunction with continued price
I ‘ ‘controls on petroleum products and

tighter regulation of the oil
companies, is the solution to the oil

F shortage. Considering the educa-
I tional level of such people, they

exhibit a surprising naivete to basic
economic principles and an appar-
ent blindness to the political,

. social, and economic effects of a
measure so extreme as World War

II style. rationing.

' "Although rationing is an attractive
’ proposal for those politicians who

cater to constituencies which are

 predominantly unsophisticated in
_» their economic concepts and for
*whom the values of immediate

gratiﬁcation and social equality are
highly salient, those same politi-
cians would be wise to weigh the
long-term effects of such measures
as the Emergency Energy Act

‘ «[which calls for a price rollback] in

relation to drumming up support

I for this year’s election.

Rationing may equalize distribu-

I tion, but it would not be worth its

side effects. First, it will be costly,
(the REO estimates 1.5 billion

’ dollars) using funds that could be
‘ better spent on energy research.

Second, rationing would be difﬁcult

. to administer, given the current

distrust for government in the wake
of Watergate and the public’s
inevitable propensity to circumvent
such a system. Third, it would
cause economic and social disrup-
tion because, unlike its proponents
allege, the burden would not fall
equally on everyone, due to our
society’s heterogenous pattern of

 work and leisure activities. Fourth,

and most important, it will not
relieve the basic problem of short
supply.

The way for the government to
maximize the availability of con-
sumer supplies is amazingly
simple: remove price controls.
And ,along with them, all manda-
tory allocation and conservation

. measures. The price mechanism is

.the natural way of allocating

 resources, because the equilibrium

price the relative valuation of a
particular resource by the public
and allows producers and consu-

, mers to determine how much will

beproduced of a given product and
how it will be use. When price
controls are established below
equilibrium levels, consumer de-
mand is more than suppliers are
willing to meet at the controlled
price. The result is a shortage.

 
 

Senator Jackson and his friends
say that if we allow prices instead
of the government to allocate
gasoline, the burden of the fuel
shortage will fall most heavily on
the poor. However, nearly every

other economic problem---housing, «

food, unemployment--all fall
most directly on the lower levels of
society. Despite some well
intentioned idealism to the con-
trary, socio-economic stratification
is a fact of life for all human

‘societies, past and present.

Europeans pay over one dollar per
gallon for gasoline, with no
apparent ill-effects. That's be-
cause they drive more efficient
vehicles (most get over 25 miles per
gallon) and drive them less often.
Most major European cities have
excellent mass transit, and ‘the
entire continent is connected by a
highly developed passenger rail
system. We Americans, however,
insist on going everywhere in
petroleum guzzling monsters, both
on the ground and in the air.

The culprit in the oil shortage is
neither the oil companies nor the
Arabs. It is an American public,
spoiled rotten. We want our
cake-and-eat-it-too. That trans-
lates into wanting an unlimited
supply of gasoline at forty cents per
gallon to power our luxury
style-mobiles, but contempora-
neously insisting on unrealistic air
quality standards and a pro-Israeli
froeign policy.

Because of our life style and
values, the immediate removeal of
price controls would casue hard-
ships for many Americans until the
economy made the neccesary
adjustments. Therefore, when we
lift price controls, let‘s have a
petroleum stamps program similar
to the food stamps program. This
scheme would permit low income
individuals to purchase (or receive
free) stamps which in turn would
be used to buy gasoline and home
heating oil. The government would
reimburse the oil comapnies at
market price on the date of
purchase. Rrevenue for this would
be generated by tollbooths on the
Interstate Highway System.

The above scheme would be
superior to coupon rationing
because it would be less costly in
that it could utilize existing food
stamp distribution systems for
administration. It would also help
the unemployment situation by
providing jobs as toll collectors.

Few people know the costs and
technical problems of petroleum
production. Oil companies spend

.wells,

millions of dollars exploring for oil,
and millions more to drill for it
(often ﬁnding a dry hole), reﬁne it,
and distribute it. The large,
multinational oil companies are the
only economic entities with
sufficient capital and expertise to
dothis. The problem’is that the
easy sources of oil are fast nearing
exhaustion, and if Americans
desire a continued plentiful supply
ofoil, they must be willing, at least
temporarily, to pay higher prices
neccessary for the development of
new sources of oil such as offshore
secondary recovery, oil-
from-coal and shale oil.

However, when the government
controls prices and artificially
attempts to limit demand through
rationing, the oil companies have
no incentives to undertake nec-
cessary research and expansion.
Like it or not, we live in a capitalist
society, where the strongest
motivation for increased producti-
vity is enticing people to invest
resources in the hope of gaining
increased command over the goods
and services produced by the rest
of the system. '

Investment is not the province of a
small clique of rich barons, but of
millions of everyday Americans
who have found, and other who
could possibly discover, oil invest-
ments more attractive than other
uses for their money. Only by
helping the oil industry instead of
hurting it will we get more oil, and
therefore, rationing, price controls,
regulation, and increased taxation,
would only exacerbate the present
situation. I

‘Fine liiﬁoiter

 

ttéotitiee in iilﬁsgttﬁse

BY GEORGE ZRUST

Here's one for Ralph Nader:
coffee machines.

You probably won't know about
this form of consumer exploitation
unless you are one .of those people

who drink coffee for reasons other .

than just wanting to look like so
many other Americans.

More simply put, unless you are
a true coffee freak, of one degree or
another.

Those of us who require coffee‘

often must turn to a variety of
sources in order to keep rolling in
caffein: home coffee pot, office and
cafeteria urns, and machines.

It is only natural that the coffee,
however basic (or acidic) the
ingredients, will vary from source
to source. Coffee brewing is a very
delicate business.

People who drink other bever-
ages seldom have to worry about
this problem of inconsistency.
Coke, even if it is made from syrup
and carbonated water for dispen-
sers, still tastes like the real thing
almost invariably.

Milk, ever since the invention of
people like Louis Pasteur, is
seldom less than pure, wholesome,
and bone-building.

And tea, brisk or otherwise, is
always piping hot or refreshingly
cold, ready to calm nerves and
stain teeth.

But coffee--that is quite another
matter.

Coffee depending on the maker,
runs the gamut from excellent to
mediocre to motor oil [actually,

used motor oil--the sludgy crank-
case variety with all the mileage on
it].

There’s really no need to
describe the effects each has on a
coffee drinker.

It is just that I feel really
downtrodden--and gypped--when I
pay for coffee and instead get
something that would have the
Coast Guard after me if I dumped
the stuff in the river.

Until last week, I went quite a
while whithout encountering any
such hard stuff, with the result that
I forgot a lesson learned first-hand
in the past: don’t buy machine
coffee.

I bought machine coffee.

Pooey.

And this is where good old
consumer Ralph comes in.

As I stood before the machine, I
right away observed the “Extra
Cream” and “Extra Sugar”
buttons alongside all the selector
buttons. If anything will help poor
coffee, it's extra cream and extra
sugar.

I opted for the extra sugar. What
I got was a rank and most bitter cup
of bilge.

I would swear that those
“Extra" buttons are just a cruel
joke. Think about it logically: how
could the profit-oriented vending
machine company give you some-
thing extra for nothing unless the
stock product were deficient and
over-priced to begin with?

I can see Nader's ‘latest
handbook, on coffee machines:

(Unsafe At Any Drink.

Being that the basketball season

while the rest of the players got
four.

Nor do I think it justifiable that
Tom, Keith, Mooney & Mickey got
to leave practice 30 minutes after it
started and everyone else, inclu-
ding Kenny and Kirk had to stay. I
mean is Pitt so fantastic that they
can afford to let their players skip
practice? Obviously not. I can
actually quote one player as saying,
“We’d have the same record even
without Ridl. We‘ve had the same
talent for the last 3 years." You’d
think that Coach Ridl would have
noticed that after losing a 12 point

lead’to Penn State that Mooney and'

Mickey could be tired. Meanwhile
he had Bolla, McBride, & Fleming
on the bench the entire game.

I also think it should be noted
that sophomore Bob Shrewsbury is
the only sophomore (or junior or
senior and most likely freshman)
that is not receiving 1 cent of
ﬁnancial aid. It seems the more
you kiss the coaches backside, the
more you get. I hope Pitt takes a
GOOD look before deciding to hire
Ridl next season.

Name Withheld Upon Request

Symbolic?

To The Editor:

On Thursday, February 28, an.

article appeared in the “University
Times" announcing the institution
of a “new graphic identity system"
for the University. Principally, it
involves a change from the present
University symbol (the candle
within a shield) to a more
contemporary design. The new

design consists of .a circle surroun-

 

. CA8 '75

ding a shield which is ..divided
horizontally by a three-tiered
checkerboard pattern and which
contains three smaller chircles.
Contemporary? Perhaps. Repre-
sentative of the University? I doubt
it. At first I thought it had been
lifted from a “Blue Cross-Blue
Shield” advertisement. -

The symbol may be represen-
tative of William Pitt and Pitts-
burgh, but says nothing about the
University. The present symbol,
however, is immediately identified
with the University. It contains/the
Light of Knowledge (candle); the
goals of education (Veritas et
Virtus); the date of the establish-
ment of the University (1787); and
three lines that could be taken to
represent Pittsburgh’s three rivers.
Taken together they say University
of Pittsburgh.

The new symbol says absolutely
nothing about the University. I’m
not against change, but I’d like to
know why the administration
decided to do away with the
present symbol and replace it with
a “contemporary” design. I also
find it difﬁcult to believe that it
took Loewy/Snaith, the design
firm, two years to come up with the
new design, and that the University
actually paid to have this work
done.

A uniform identification system
is a deﬁnite necessity, but it could
have been achieved just as
effectively by using the present
symbol. The new University
symbol seems to be a clear-cut case
of University funds being abused
and misused.

Pitt Student Eeciecl Stote CYDPres.

BY BILL HADUCK_
Betty Nelson, President of Pitt’s

. College Young Democrats, (CYD),

was elected President of College
Young Democrats of Pennsylvania
at the organization's convention in
Harrisburg, Sunday.

It is the first time a Pitt student
has been elected president of the
organization, which is comprised of
32 local clubs on campuses across
the state. Nelson estimated there
are between 1500 and 1750
members included in the statewide
group.

“The number of clubs has
doubled since last year,” she said
when contacted in Harrisburg,
“even though it’s the year of
Watergate, and ‘politician’; quote,
unquote, is a dirty word.

“It's not that Watergate is
turning people _off. Watergate is
making people more interested in
the direction government is going
to take.”

People of college age have the
greatest opportunity to make the
change and become concerned
citizens said Nelson, who was
Executive Vice President last year
for the state organization, and is
currently president of Pitt CYD.

“I’m going to resign as president
of the Pitt club,” she said. “It
would take too much time and I

wouldn’t be able to do justice to ~

both clubs.” She said CYD Vice

Four Positions

Remain Open

in Anthro Study

BY TOM VERBISH

The anthropology department is
currently accepting applications
from both graduate and under-
graduate students for the summer
ﬁeld school at Meadowcroft Shel-
ter, an archaeological dig near
Avella, Pa.

Dr. James Adovasio, heading the
program, noted, however, “Chan-
ces for being selected now are
small. Only 4 positions remain
open of the 23 offered.”

This is the second year for the
ﬁeld school at the Meadowcroft
site, a collapsed rock shelter
inhabited as far back as 4000 B.C.
“It is unique as it is the largest
unexcavated rock shelter in wes-
tern Pennsylvania,” said Adovasio,
an assistant professor of anthro-
pology at Pitt.

“The rock layers are deep, long
and undisturbed. Also the yield of
plant and bone fragments has been
great. Thus the dig enables
students to familiarize themselves

with the mechanics of archaeo-.

logical recovery, data processing,
etc.” ' .
In excess of 30,000 bones and
bone fragments have been recov-
ered from the site, dating back to
the last glacial period.

Ron Carlisle, a graduate student
of the archaeology department,
said, “Several charred baskets

were found and are now undergo-'

ing a stabilizing process before the
clay surrounding them is removed..

“Judging from the radio carbon
tests they may be the oldest
basketry yet discovered in the
U.S." .

The summer field session, which
runs from June 19 to August 7 is
expected to be the last one at the
,‘Meadowcroft dig.

~ President John Rohe will probably

take her position.

Concerning the upcoming sena-
torial race, Nelson said, “I don’t
think Schweiker is unbeatable. I
think people are more concerned

senator.”

than just fancy rhetoric.

“One thing Schweiker hasgoing

Computer/vlojor Proposed Suspended License Driving Proposed

Al CA3 Council Meeting

A BY MATTHEW KAMBIC

Proposals to initiate an undergra-
duate computer science major and

' ,__.a joint major in computer science

and mathematics were discussed
yesterday at a College of Arts and
Sciences Council (CASC) meeting.

“Computer science is a very
strong and growing discipline
around the country,” said Orrin E.
Taulbee, computer science chair-
man. “There is a great demand for

R people in this field and only a small

number are being turned out.”
Pitt has a graduate program in
computer science, but the under-
graduateprogram is geared basi-
cally towards service courses
leading in the general direction of

’ the graduate program.

~ Taulbee feels many students
would be attracted to an under-
graduate program. “Indiana and

Taulbee said numerous universi-
ties around the country have
already implemented undergrad-
uate computer science majors.

The new proposal was ques-
tioned on many aspects, including
the need for more equipment and
possible staff increases. The CAS
Council was also interested in the
ﬂexibility of the program in serving
chemistry, physics, and math
students who might take courses in
the program to learn computer
programming for research in their
own fields.

The joint computer science--
mathematics major was discussed
briefly by Chairman of mathema-
tics, Wilbur E. Deskins. The
Council agreed to hold a vote on the
two proposals until they could be
discussed further.

The application would be turned

CHICAGO AP--The National
Safety Council reported Monday
that the number of trafﬁc deaths in
the nation in January dropped
dramatically from the same month
a year ago. The Council said the
fuel shortage had a great deal to do
with the 25 per cent decrease.

The Council reported 3,020

4,020 for January 1973. The
current January total was the
lowest for the first month of the
year since 1963.

said, and might respond by cutting

exceed their point allocations.

The point system requires license
suspensions of at least 60 days for
drivers who accumulate 11 points
or more for various infractions of
the vehicle code. Speeding up to 10
miles an hour above the limit bring
three points and 11 miles or more
above the limit brings six points.

When a driver is convicted of
exceeding the speed limit by 16
miles an hour or more, however, he
receives an automatic suspension
of at least 15 days along with his six
points.

A driver‘s total is reduced by two
points for each year his record

If one sees something wrong, he is

is in being co-opted by the system,

“You only get your feet wet
once."

Mist rolling off the cornﬁelds
over wooden dance floors on a slow
country evening. Long gingham
dresses, neckerchiefs and pig tails.
The mellow sugar sweetness of
country guitars and a steady
down-home country stomp.

Ron Walker is playing drums

tonight for a group called Joe.

Diamond's Country Band. He
doesn't play regularly for Diamon,
but Joe needed him tonight for this
job at Pitt.

“I used to play with them
regular, but the bookings were too
loose. So, I play with this other
band and drive a schoolbus. That’s
about it.” Ron pushes the wave
back on his hair. “I’d like to go
back to Nashville and try to record
again. I've worked with Bob Berry,
the Blue Ridge Gospel singers and
a lot of people.

“I ﬁgure you don't get what you
don’t go after."

There is no criterion of musi-

. cianiship that would make Diamond

a unique kind of band. But,
playing Folsom Prison Blues and
Red River Valley in the SU
Ballroom begins to attract the
public attention.

“I like country music. I like
traveling. I can’t see what you’ve
got by goin’ to J & L for twenty
years, eight hours a day, seein’ the

inside of walls. Shit, you could
walk over there and that chandelier

. would fall on your head and what

would you have out of life. I ﬁgure
movin’ around seein’ thing, meet-
in’ people is Iearnin’ about life.”
Ron’s been from Deadwater
Missouri to Pittsburgh and he likes
to talk about it.

“Country music is best in the
midwest. Really, Pittsburgh is
dead compared to some of them
towns with a main street and half a
dozen bars. They don't have too
many people but those places go
six days a week.”

Diamond is a three piece band
backing up Hezzy Reese, the hoe
down caller. “I’m from Washing-
ton, Pa.,." Hezzy puts down his
corncob pipe. “This just kind of
happened to me. I went to a dance
fourteen years ago and the caller
didn't show up.”

“Round to the left. Round to the.

right. Swing your partner in the
valley. Swing your partner four by
four." And the people like it.

The country music revival is
sponsored by COTA, the Com-
mittee on the Arts, a part of the
Student Union Board.

A small crowd of about one
hundred people swells into at least
four hundred as Ron -and Joe
Diamond pack up their instru-
ments. Joe talks business.

“Yea, I have a recording studio

Nashville. As a matter of fact, we

just recorded a single “Poor Side of

Town” and “Runaway” on the
Blue Diamond label.” That’s Joe’s
company. “We have a political
thing coming out soon by a group
called Carfax Abby. It’s about -
Nixon. It’s called “Hang On
America.”

“You said it's best we part, even
though it broke my heart."

And suddenly there's dynamite.
The Dixie Travelers, from Walshes
in the East Liberty Mall, sweep the
stage with a bluegrass barage.

» Little Maggie, Long Black Veil,

Bluegrass Stomp, and Dixie Break-
down excite the crowd to applaud

Davis and Simon: For A Casual Chat

KARL BALDYS and
ED HOLLIN_

A powerful sound system reso-
nates from an angular beehive of
speakers. It’s like the speaker is
standing right next to you,

standing right next to eveyone after .

the fashion of television or radio.
There is a mass intimacy with Clive
Davis, former president of Colum-
bia records.

Davis lectures with the casual
Paul
Simon is back stage, but he won't
play tonight. It’s a unique event
when Paul Simon doesn’t play and
when an ex-promoter lectures. '

“I don’t know if anything like
this has ever been done before,”
says Davis. ‘‘I’m not sure what
that indicates.”

Back to the days when Rock
albums were scarce. “When Elvis

Presley and Bill Haley were making A

it there were no real album sales. I
don’t think many people ever
expected what would happen.”

Davis slides into the discussion

 _ with a soft-spoken smoothness,

He reveals some of the high-
lights of his job with Columbia: the

signing of Janis Joplin; the signing _

of Blood, Sweat & Tears, the
watchful waiting with -Bob Dylan.

“The best way to make an artist
was through a hit single. Usually
an artist would hit with a single and
then go on to an album. It was rare
for someone to make it in concert,
on tour.”

Davis is more credible than Dick
Clark.

“If you’re an executive at a
record company, you don’t only
show proﬁts but increased proﬁts
year after year." ’ '

Davis was fired from Columbia
last June and sued for the return of
$94,000 of company money. He

"was also subpoenaed by a Newark

grand jury investigating drug and
cash payola in the record industry.

Are you bitter about leaving
Columbia?

“I'm sad about leaving Colum-
bia, not bitter.”

Are you going to stay with the
industry?

“Yes, some people are forming a
new company,...we don’t have a
name yet.”

Davis doesn’t spare Simon.

Paul Simon moves on, white pants,
ski jacket, sunglasses, nonchal-
ance.
Back to high school talent shows.
“I heard Art (Garfunkel) singing,
and I told him I thought he had a
really good voice. That’s how we
met.” The Simon and Garfunkle

team went to high school together. -
“When we ﬁrst started working _

as a team, our promoter thought
the world just wasn't ready for a
group called Simon & Garfunkle, so
we began as Tom & Jerry.”

Simon talks about recording
when Glen Campbell was still a
studio musician. Here’s to you
Mrs. Roosevelt.

“The Graduate was a kind of
plateau for Simon & Garfunkle. At
first we thought that we’d be doing
songs as filler between scenes or
something. I didn’t really write
Mrs. Robinson for the movie. I’d
written a song, a political thing.
that went ‘Here’s to you Mrs.
Roosevelt, the country needs
you more than you will know.’ We
changed a few things and‘ it fit.”

The crowd is responsive to Simon
even though he’s low-key and
almost shy. Nearly ﬁve hundred
people applaud and laugh with
Simon. Perhaps it’s small by
concert standards, but for a casual

. chat, it’s impressive.

Simon: “Art and I were one of
the ﬁrst groups to spend a lot of
time in the studio.
always asking us why our albums
were late.” V

Many people in the audience
were interested in why the team
broke-up. “I think the beginning
of the end was when Art did a part
in Catch 22. He asked me, before
he took it, and I said no it wouldn’t
bother me, -I didn’t want to get in
his way, we could stay together.‘
And then, as we spent less and less
time workin'g',The4t~e_n'si5n_bimt. It
did bother me.

“We were cutting Bridge Over
Troubled Water and ‘there was
supposed to be another cut. I
wanted to do a thing I wrote called
“Cuba Si, Nixon.No" and Art
wanted to re-do a Bach chorale.
Finally, Art made Carnal Know-
ledge and it ended."

Simon has a new album of his
own work which will be released
shortly. “Probably next week.”

Questions and answers. From
the audience comes a plea, “What

' is an artist who lives in Pittsburgh

supposed ‘to do?”

Davis: “He can’t stay here.”

never took off his sunglasses.

HARRISBURG AP--Up to 15
counseling centers for veterans
would be set up throughout the
state under a $400,000 program
approved Monday in the House.

The bill was sent to the Senate
after 179-6 House passage.

The bill was sent to the Senate
after 179-6 House passage.

The Department of Military
Affairs would run the centers,
designed to provide information to
veterans on education and other
benefits they may be missing.

Rep. James Romanelli, D-Alle-
gheny, one of the bill’s sponsors,
said that Pennsylvania ranks 3rd
among the 50 states in number of
returning veterans but 29th in the
nation in total beneﬁts the veterans
receive from a- variety of govern-
ment programs.

HARRISBURG AP--A bill

,designed to. avoid delays in

awarding state scholarships be-
cause of budget deadlocks passed
the Senate Monday, 40-6.

The measure provides that if no
appropriation is approved by May 1
of each year, the existing level of
funding would automatically be
triggered in for the new fiscal year
beginning July 1.

Currently, if the entire budget is
not passed by July 1, no ‘money is
appropriated for the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance
agency to award grants," thus
creating uncertainty for students.

HARRISBURG AP--A bill to
permit taprooms to remain open on
St. Patrick’s Day was defeated in
the House Monday, 95-89. The
holdiay falls on March 17, this year
a Sunday, when most taverns
apparently will be forced to close.

'. Ken Wampler and Julie Quinio appear in scene from University of
Pittsburgh Theatre production, The Marry-Go-Wrong.

The institution of marriage is a

1 topic for comic ridicule in Georges
.Feydeau's classic French farce,
-The Marry-Go-Wrong [Le mariage
. de Bari|lon],,to be presented by the

University of Pittsburgh Theatre,

beginning Thursday, March 7, at

 8:30 pm in the Stephen Foster
'  Memorial.

Subsequent evening
performances are scheduled for
March 8 and 9, March 14 through

3 .16, and March 21 through 23 at

8:30 pm. Matinees for high school

and community groups will be held
0 n Wednesdays, March 13 and 20
at 1 pm.

The opening performance on
March 7 has been designated
“Community Theatre Night.” The
University Theatre, in an attempt
to bring together those involved in
theatre in the tri-state area, is
offering special group rates and a
special program of activities.
Theatre groups attending this
performance will be given a tour of
the backstage area and will meet
the cast and crew. And, in the

 

“Marry-Go-Wrong" Opens

mood of the production, French
pastries and’ wine will be available
at intermission.

Community and high school
groups attending the matinees are
also eligible for reduced rates and.
for an extra fee, may obtain
playscripts and instructional pack-
ets. designed to aid classroom
discussion of the play. The packet
includes historical background,

‘notes from the director. discussion

questions, and projects to help
make the play a meaningful part of
the educational experience.‘

The Marry-Go-Wrong, directed
by Gillette Elvgren, assistant
professor of theatre arts at Pitt,
contains elements of slapstick and
farce combined with high comedy
of manners. The plot revolves
around a woman who is mistakenly
married to two men at the same
time. The three live in the same
house and try, absurdly, to observe
the monogamous rules of society.

Starring in the play are Jocelyn
Johnson as Madame Jambart, and
her two husbands played by Edwin
Rupert and Frank Serraof

Feydeau, who is probably best
known for his other works, Hotel
Paradiso and Chemin de Fer, is
considered a forerunner of the
theatre of the absurd and of
colorful, mindless situation come-
dies. The Pitt production attempts
to capture this spirit in interpre-
tation, costumes, and set design.

The technical staff includes

Lynne Hemingway, costumes;
Henry Heymann, settings and
props; Richard Knowles, technical
direction; and Kathleen Fallat
Conlin, business manager and
assistant director.

Tickets for the Marry-Go-Wrong
may be obtained by calling the
University Theatre box office at
624-4101, from 1 to 5 pm, Monday
through Saturday, or they may be
purchased at the door on the

eveining of the performance.
Community and student groups
planning to attend a matinee
should call the box office for
reservations or write to the
Business Manager, University of
Pittsburgh Theatre, 1117 Cathedral
of Learning, Pittsburgh, PA 15260.
Community Theatre groups wish-
ing to attend the opening night
performance should also call or

A Pynchon’s Finest: “Roinbow"

BY HARRIS LEVY

Gravity’s Rainbow

by Thomas Pynchon

760 pp. Viking Press
$15.00 (hardbound)

$4.95 (paperback)

Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity,
Rainbow is one of the most
ambitious books of recent years.

Pynchon, 36, is the author of two
other novels, V. (1963) and The
Crying of Lot 49 [I966]. Gravity’s

_ Rainbow was published a year ago,

but discussion of it is relevant as it
will probably be considered for the
National Book Award or the
Pulitzer Prize.

Gravity’s Rainbow shares them-
atic concerns with its two prede-

cessors but surpasses them in

scope, seriousness, imagination
and writing quality.
The main plot of Gravity's

Rainbow concerns the attempts of
several different groups and
individuals to find information
about the mysterious German V-2
rocket 00000. The book’s events
take place in occupied Germany at
the close of World War II. Many
less consequential plots interweave
with the main plot as Pynchon uses
several dozen languages and
dialects and creates several hun-
dred characters.

The book's most important
character is American officer
Tyrone Slothrop who is stationed“ in
London during the war: When he
was an infant, Slothrop was
conditioned by the renowned Dr.
Laslo Jamf to have erections in
response to‘ rocket firings.
Inadequately deconditioned, Sloth-
rop keeps a map of girls’ houses
that exactly coincides with the
locations where V-2 rockets have
landed. '

This similarity is noted by his
superiors and Slothrop is then
observed by government scientists.

Slothrop is compelled by his
relationship with the rocket to go to
occupied Germany in search of the
00000; the 00000 was distinguished
from other rockets by having a
special attachment called the
Schwargerat.

Slothrop gradually loses identity

as he is transformed into first,
Rocketman, and then the Pig Hero
through costumes. In other words,
Slothrop's personality
disintegrates.

Other important characters in-
clude Russian officer Tchitcherine
who uses the search for the rocket
as a way to find and attempt to
destroy his black half-brother,
Enzian. Typical of the book is the
fact that when Tchitcherine does
finally meet Enzian, neither of
them know it as they have never
met before; the signiﬁcance of the
meeting thus goes unnoticed.

Enzian is one of the leaders of
the Hereros a group of Africans
transplanted to Germany (which is
generally referred to _as “the

Zone”). Some of the Hereros are
incarnations of the death wish as
they want their tribe to die out;
they kill newborn Herero babies.

Enzian wants to find and recon-
struct the 00000 to show the white
people’s death wish in the form of

this powerful annihilating weapon.

Weissman [alias “Blicero”] is
the German officer who constructs
the special rocket and equips it
with its special payload. Without
revealing the identity of the
Schwarzgerat, let me note that the
00000 fuses life love and death.

Dozens of other fascinating
characters round out the novel as
Pynchon creates a dense network of
subplots that include Harvard, GE,

the remarkable plastic lmpolex G,

  

and German movies.

Pynchon’s wonderful stories are
matched by his astonishing imag-
ination and great writing skill. The
book is full of great set—pieces; the
life story of Byron the immortal
light Bulb suggests the possibility
of an international light-bulb
conspiracy. .

Pynchon recognizes the chal-
lenge that literature has had in this
century from comics, movies,
science and drugs and effectively
tries to meet it.

Pynchon’s writing derives much
from comic books and film.
Pynchon frequently uses spellings
such as “sez” and “Foax" (for
folks) to undercut the seriousness
of his enterprise. ‘ Pynchon’s
writing, like Vonnegut’s is very
self-conscious and includes many
asides. The book frequently
switches from narrative into songs.

Pynchon’s genius resides in his

many diverse forces on our world.

He is receptive to more inﬂuences

recognize the beauty in science as ' ’

than most authors. He
well as its potential for destruction.
Pynchon’s book is not easy
reading. The first couple hundred
pages are especially difficult as
events are frequently confusing.

Like the parabola which is

frequently used for comparison by 3

Pynchon, the book rises from
incomprehensibility into clarity and
at the end sinks again into
confusion.

The central element of the book ' '

is the rocket. Phychon uses the
rockets’ parabolic ascent and
descent as well as its sexual
implications. -

Pynchon’s depiction of how

  Pitt, St. Ja’s, Surprise Teams

BY RON SIEGEL

SPORTS EDITOR
It will be the showdown of the
surprise teams Saturday when the
Panthers meet St. Joseph's Satur-
day night in Morgantown, W.Va. at

. 7:10.

While pre-season optimists gave
Pitt a fair shot at the NIT, St. Jo's
was picked to ﬁnish last among
Philadelphia's big ﬁve. The Hawks
defeated LaSalle last Saturday to

S , win the Middle-Atlantic Confer-

ence, and the right to meet Pitt.
Saturday's game will seem like a

home game to the Panthers. Ticket

sales in Pittsburgh should be much

‘greater than in Philadelphia, and

that cursed West Virginia Coliseum
,should be friendly, for one game

V A anyhow.

  

BUZZ RIDL
Coach of Year

 

The game will defiinitely not be
televised in Pittsburgh. TVS is
broadcasting the game regionally,
but no Pittsburgh station will be
permitted to pick the game up, due
to NCAA regulations.

Not only in St. Joseph’s similar
to Pitt in the remarkability of their
being in the NCAA playoffs, they
also play the same type of
basketball.

“They switch a lot on defense,
and don't have a real big man,"
said Pitt coach Buzz Ridl at
yesterday's basketball luncheon.
“While we substitute players for
long periods, their subs only go in

to give the regulars a break."

Ridl was unanimously named
coach of the year by the Pittsburgh
Basketball Writers at the luncheon,
in recognition of the 23-3 season
Pitt posted this year.

For Billy Knight, the honors
have begun to pour in. “Mooney”
was unanimously named player-of-
the year at the luncheon, and also
made several All—American teams.
United Press International placed
him on the third team, while the
Sporting News picked the 6-6

‘senior to its second team.

The All-District team was also
announced at the luncheon, with
Knight being the only unanimous
selection. Another Panther that
made the squad was Mickey
Martin. . -

The team was rounded out by
Lionel Billingy of Duquesne,

and Penn State's Ron Brown.

It was Brown's desperation jump
shot that "snapped Pitt's 22-game
winning streak at University Park.

Knight finished the regular
season with a 21.7 points-per-game
average, and 1664 career points,
second on the all-time list behind
Don Hennon. He "would have to
average 36 points per game to
catch Hennon, and the Panthers
would have to advance to National
Championship in Greensboro,
N .C., March 23-5. It will be tough
for Pitt to get that far, but if Knight
is scoring 36 a game, it could easily
happen.

A Panther victory Saturday
sends the Cats to the Eastern
Regionals in -Raleigh, N.C. March
14-16. Pitt's opponent. in the 7:05
game on the 14th will be the winner
of the South Carolina-Furman
clash, with the Gamecocks heavily
favored.

Plenty of tickets remain for the
West Virginia game, the best seats
being sold at the Student Union
Box Ofﬁce.

“Tiger” Leads The Cheers

BY LEE GUTKIND

Tiger Paul Auslander. Pitt’s one
and only self-designated unofﬁcial-
ofﬁcial cheerleader, is 30 years
old, balding, and so lumpy-looking
that fat bulges from him like bread
dough in ten different places.
Standing on the sidelines, ten
minutes before game time, lis-

. tening to the crowd humming in

light, cheery anticipation, he
tightens the cinch of his gold lame
bathrobe, stares down at his black,
high-top, P.F. Flyers, then takes a
deep, an enormous breath, and
leaps, twirls and twists out onto the
boards.

If a frog could gallop, it would look
like Tiger Paul, sprinting, squat-

ting and leaping jerkily back and

forth over the playing area. At the
sight of him, the crowd comes
alive. '

And when Tiger sheds his gold
lame bathrobe, his blue and gold
Pitt letter sweater, his white shirt
and black concertmaster’s bow tie
dangling each item like a burlesque
queen from his pinky ﬁnger before
dropping it to the ground, ﬁve
thousand voices swallow the
stadium. '

“I get out on the court as fast as I
can, ” Tiger explains, “and I wind
the kids up, using my arms in a
windmill-like motion, first on one
side of the Field House and then
the other, getting everybody into
the action, round and round, I
pump my arms as fast as I can, as
fast as propellers, while they yell,
‘Let‘s gooooo...’

“Then I punch. I lash out as hard
as I can with the ‘old one-two‘ and
they yell, ‘Pitt!’

“It‘s really very rewarding, and I

put all the body English I can
muster into it. Sometimes I get
carried away. A couple of weeks
ago, I twirled my arms so hard that
I dislocated my shoulder. It's
worth it, though. I'll sacriﬁce
anything to help the Panthers win.

At the West Virginia game in
Morgantown, one of their coaches
told me I was the most important
man on the team."

When‘ the signal is given for the
start of the game Tiger concludes
his act with a bow, gathers up his
recently shed belongings, huffs
and puffs‘ off the field and collapses
on the sidelines like a bag full of
bagels. He will repeat his act in
moderate form, five or six times

_ more during time-outs and half

time. A strenuous undertaking,
but no one can doubt that it is

Terrible Luck Costs
* Tracksters At C4/I A

- BY RICK STOUFFER

Bad breaks, poor luck, call it
what you like ‘but it bit the Pitt
Tracksters over the weekend as
they tied for seventh at the Eastern
Track Championshipsheld at
Princeton.

“We just got some awful tough.

breaks," according to Assistant
Track Coach Smittie Brown. “If
things had gone a little differently
we could have been in fourth place
at least.”

It seemed the bad breaks started
before the team left Pittsburgh.
Freshman Don Betterly, usually a
standout in the mile relay, was
scheduled to compete in the 440 ‘at
Princeton but an injury suffered in
a previous meet kept him from
competing. ‘

Chuck Mozingo was another
casuality. Mozingo, always a top
competitor in the two mile relay or
the 880 run, came down with the flu
Friday at Princeton and was too
sick to race. “It wasn’t Chuck’s
fault that he got sick, it was just
one of those things,” according to
Brown.

Probably the worst break of all

_happened to high jumper Tim

Riley. Riley, who was hurt at the
Ohio State Invitational two weeks
ago because he missed the jumping
pit, missed the pit completely at
Princeton. H

“The padding had been moved
to one end for _the floppers,”
according to Brown, “but no one

1 had bothered to move it back for

Tim. He didn’t realize until it was
too late."

“His back just stiffened up on
him,” Brown continued, “and he
couldn’t compete anymore.” .

Rich Markley, always a top
runner in the 1000 yard run (having
taken ﬁrst at the OSU Pitt
Invitational) was knocked out of
competition in the semiﬁnals.

“Rich made the mistake of
making too many moves while
running his race,” Brown said.
Moving around on the track wastes
a lot of valuable time.”

Andre Harris, who has qualified
’ for the NCAA’s, had not run a race
in over a month, made it to the
quarter ﬁnals at Princeton while
freshman Jay Sharpley got to the
semiﬁnals. “Jay’s performance
was excellent for a freshman,”
Brown said.

Although it seemed as though
nothing went right for the
tracksters, there were some bright
points.

Rich Jackson, one of the Senior
tri-captains on the team, ﬁnished a
close third in the 600, only four
tentsh of a second behind‘ the
winner. Jackson, a great quarter
miler, proved he can go the longer
distance with the best in the East.

The distance medley relay team,
who had held the fastest time in the
East before the IC4A’s, finished a
strong fourth at Princeton behind
the record breaking time of
Villanove.

The team- of Jack Patrick, Tom
Moore, Bob O’Neil, and Nick
Martin (who excepting Moore are
all sophomores) seemed to satisfy
Brown.

“The guys really did a good job,
Nick (Martin) and Bob (O’Neil) are
really improving. O’Neil especially
is just coming into his own.” .

The big success story came from
long jumper Billy Rea. The Pitt
star broke .the oldest IC4A record
[32 years old established by Barney
Ewell of Penn State] with a leap of
25 feet 7 inches.

Rea had not been getting any
competition in his previous meets
with his best jump before Princeton
a 24 feet 84 inches at the Michigan
State Relays.

“Our performances were as good
as possible,” Brown said. “We
suffered some awful tough breaks
which we couldn't do anything
about.”

Bad luck hits every team at least
once in a while but Pitt's Tracksters
will spring back now that it's out of
their system, hopefully for the
Nationals.

performed with love.

How Tiger’ Paul acquired his
position with Pitt athletics is a
mystery to anyone you ask. He is
not a student, nor is he affiliated
with the cheerleaders or any other
University department or organiza-
tion. At each game, he just
manages to appear.

“One day, a couple years ago,”
said a Pitt alumnus, “this guy
leaped out of the stands in that silly
looking bathrobe and started to
lead a cheer. Frankly, the way our
teams have been going up until this
year, he was a welcome relief to the
tragedytaking place on the field."

Tiger Paul is a lifetime resident of
the East Liberty section of
Pittsburgh and a graduate of
Peabody High .,School. “I’ve
always liked sports,” he says, “but
in high school they wouldn’t let me
try out for any of the teams, I was
so short and skinny. I we_nt to the
football coach, the basketball
coach-, but none would ever give me
a chance. .

“That’s when I turned to
coaching. I had a team at the
Macabee Basketball Leagues at the
WHA some years ago, and we won
our division. Icoached Bill Knight
/there for a season. In the summers
teams and
umpired Little League baseball.”
-Saidia Pitt student from the East
End:“I remember Tiger as an
umpire. He was alwaysthrowing
people out of the games. One time
he fined me six cents for

swearing.

“Tiger knows his sports,“ said a
former member of one of Tiger’s
teams, “but he’s a terrible coach.
He can’t ‘communicate with his
players. He has no charisma on a
personal level, nor strength of
characterrthat commands respect
and attention. , /

‘‘He’s an awfully loyal person,
though. Once you meet him, ‘your
phone rings for ayear. He’s got
baseball, football, soccer, basket-
ball, hockey teams and he’s always
lookingfor people to play on them.
It got to the point that l was taking
my phone off the hook at the start
of each new season.”

After high school, Tiger enrolled
at Duquesne University, a little
taller and much heavier, “but they

still wouldn’t let me try out for their .

teams,” he says. “I hung around

“‘Wh0’s gonna win the NCAA?”

 

that school for a while, but I was
really down_in the dumps, so I quit '
and got ajob, and now spend all my
free time reading sports magazines
and coaching.

“I work for the Pittsburgh Press,
you know. I‘m a paperboy, but I‘m
not ashamed of it. People say,
‘Why are you, a nice, polite,
intelligent person of thirty deli-
vering papers?’ I tell them that it
just makes sense for me. I live at
home with my parents. I’m not
married, and my paper route is in

 

my own neighborhood, where I’ve
been my whole life.

“I don‘t have to wash dishes, or
clean up or doany cooking. My
mother does that all for me. I can
devote all my time to sports. I
don't need much money either,
only for tickets to basketball,
baseball, hockey and football
games. It doesn’t amount to much.

“People make fun of me, being a
paperboy, but I know exactly what
I'm doing. I just hope it’s not
degrading to the University. I

Tiger” takes avbrlef rest after one of his strenous timeout cheering.

He's always back on his feet when the game resumes.

mean, a paperboy being a
cheerleader for a college team.
Can you see the contradiction in
that?"

Of course, Tiger is both correct
and incorrect. There are worse
ways to make an honest living than
delivering newspapers, but his
position as self-designated unoffi-
cial-official cheerleader is some-
what in jeopardy.

“There was a move afoot to get
rid of Tiger earlier this year,”
confirmed one member of the
athletic department. I can’t name
any names, but some people
around here, coaches and admini-
strators both, don’t like him.
There’s been a lot of pressure from
the alumni, too, the people with
money. They think it’s rather
degrading to our image to have him
around. Frankly, I didn’t expect
him to last this long.

“Tiger does present us with a
problem, you see, especially. when
he shows up at any away game.

We don't have a legal responsibi-

in a moral sense. He's a

strange-looking person, you'll have
to admit, and an unfriendly home
_ team crowd really gets on him. At

' the Temple game last year, they
‘ tried to beat him up. And the
things they said to him, weren't
even human. That situation puts
us in a very awkward position.”

Now the game is over, the lights
are dimmed and Tiger sits alone in
_ the stands. Only a few fans
' M remain, mostly parents, relatives
' or friends of the team, waiting for

their heroes to dress and Tiger, his
‘chin resting on his fist, watches

them silently.

. Tiger has already packed away his

bathrobe and other parts of his

costume and changed into a rust
colored sweater and blue gabardine
pants. He’s ‘still wearing his high
top tennis shoes. When he talks,
the shadows from the ceiling of the
old building seem to walk across
'. his face.

“I like being the object of
attention," he sighs. “During the
game, it‘s all very exciting to me.
Everybody knows me and greets
me and watches me with smiles on
their faces. But it’s awfully sad,
when it’s all over. I mean, the
whole season is over, and except
for the NCAA eliminations, I have
to wait another whole year."

Tiger stands up slowly, shaking
his head and clapping his hands
softly together once or twice. He
‘looks very egg-shaped and un-
happy, the cuffs of his gabardine
pants droop like sad wet leaves
over his tennis shoes.

~“I really hope they let me come

back next year," he says softly,

sweeping his arm over the boards

and hoops and backboards and

bleachers below him. “Today I am

where I have always wanted to be

and I wouldn't want to lose it. As
cheerleading goes, I'm on top."
