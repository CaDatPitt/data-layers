000 Students Going
I n South Bend Trip

Tonight the big exodus to South Bend, home of the Fighting

‘Irish of Notre Dame, gets underway.

I .

Smitlifield and Carson Streets at

Two trains will leave the P. and L. E. railroad station at

11:30 p.m. carrying 962 students

and alumni to the Notre Dame football game.
Three others will also leave Friday for Notre Dame. The

B. & 0. system will run a special
sponsored by the Knights of Col-
umbus and the other two will leave
from the Pennsylvania station under
the sponsorship of adowntown news-
paper.

Included in this group are the
140 men that make up the Varsity
Marching Band. The band will travel
in a special five-car section at-
tached to the student train.

The band’s cars will be separated
from the rest of the train by a
baggage car.

Students and the band will make
the trip on a traincalled the "Young
Panther.” It will be composed of
eight cars plus those of the band.

i The alumni will ride on a train.

{named “The Old Panther.” It was '

foriginally planned to have the alumni
jand the undergraduates on the same
itrain, but two trains had to be em-
ployed because of the large turn-
out of graduates.

Eight chaperones will travel with
the student section: a railroad of-
ficial, the University policeman,

end-Off Rally Slated Tonight

Drink Issue °Not Job

eception Set
or Airport

Two pep rallies for the Notre
Dame game will be held over the
weekend, one tonight at the P&LE
station, and the other Saturday
evening at the county airport.

Tonight Pitt songs and cheers
will echo through the railroad sta-
tion, where a rally at 10:30 p.m.
will precede the 11:30 departure of
the student and alumni trains for
Notre Dame. It is for all students,
not just those who are leaving for
Notre Dame. This was stressed by
Dick Richards, Student Congress
assemblies chairman.

Win or lose, there will be a rally
when the team returns from Notre
Dame. The plane carrying the
players will arrive at County Air-
port between 8 and 9 p.m. Saturday
Last year when the team return-
ed from Penn after a 22-21 victory
it was met by a group of students
at the airport. Richards expects
that the same will hold true this
year, and that some of the students
who could not go to Notre Dame
will be on hand to greet the team.

He suggested that groups could
make up parties to go out in pri-

vate cars at 8 p.m. Saturday and
await the team's arrival.

Of Athletic Committee’

The University ,Ath‘letic Committee has by-passed Student
Congress’ request that something be done about drinking in the

Stadium.

At Monday’s meeting Don Ewart reported on the ‘committee's
reply to a letter submitted by Congress on Oct. 10. The letter
had asked the committee to investigate the drinking situation
in order to find possible solutions to it.

Referred to Administrators

The committee answered that the
problem of handling drinking in the
stadium is not Within its province,
since it is only a policy-making
body. It said that it is up to the
University administration to take
specific action on the matter.

Congress took no action on the
report.

A similar letter is being sent to
the University Senate, but it was
learned that consideration of the
matter is not on the agenda of this
Friday’s Senate meeting.

Finale Dance [leads Named

Earl Jacob announced his Appoint-
ments Committee's selection of

to be held Nov. 25. They are: Marie

Pitt Eyes
Upset of
Notre Dame

B)’ WILL. DOERGE

A victory over Notre Dame at
South Bend tomorrow would go a
long way toward making Pitt
football followers forget the dis-

mal record of the Panthers this
season.

Now is the time to whip the once-
mighty Irish, maintain Panther
rooters, for Notre Dame is certainly
not a power to be feared any more.
The Irish have a mediocre 3-3 re-
cord. Two of the weakest teams in
the Big Ten, Purdue and Indiana,
hold victories over them.

Pitt Coach Len Casanova will
be without the services of Halfback
Bill Sichko, who aggravated a rib
injury against West Virginia last
week. Dave Fyock will again re-
place Sichko as offensive left half-
back.

Game Sold Out

The game has been sold out for
several weeks, insuring a capacity’
crowd of 57,000 in Notre Dame Stad-
ium. Notre Dame is listed as a
14-point favorite over the Panthers.

Here's what Pitt has to do to
beat the Irish tomorrow - (1) Stop
the passing of Bob Williams, and
(2) Keep their ground attack rolling
like it did against West.Virginia.

Up until the Navy game last
week, Notre Dame’:s main offensive
weapon has been the pass, with
ground gaining relegated to a sec-
ondary role.

Williams Flips

Their passing, with Quarterback
Williams doing the flipping and End
Jim Mutscheller doing most of the
catching, has accounted for 877
yards and 12 of Notre Dame’s 15
touchdowns.

It’s no secret that pass defense
has been Pitt's biggest weakness
this season, so the Panthers have
their work cut out for them in
stopping the Irish passing attack.
Pitt has allowed 827 yards and 13
touchdowns by passing.

Playing in :1 rainstorm against
Navy, the Irish were forced to give
up their passing game for the most
part and rely on a ground game to
win, thus proving themselves to be
as good mudders as Pitt.

Irish Line Weak

Notre Dame gained 200 yards,
their second best rushing perform-
ance of the season. Pitt almost
doubled the Irish output by gaining
390 yards against West Virginia.

Opponents of Notre Dame have
done very well in picking up yard-
age through the South Benders’
sieve-like line, which has yielded.
1195 yards by rushing in six games.

Coach Frank Le"ahy sought to
remedy the situation by resorting
to the two-platoon system against
Navy, and the move proved instru-
mental in the victory.

Groom Was Exception
Leahy used separate offensive
and defensive units in the first

_ The Cathedral of Learning and its Nationality Rooms recently
made the front pages of every newspaper in "the oldest city in

Behind the sudden publicity was gratitude from Syria and
Lebanon. A group of U.S. citizens, led by a Pitt grad, had made
it plain that these two countries are tied to the U.S. by strong

bonds of friendship.

Symbols of these links were two

presentation speech to Prime Min-
ister Nazim Bey El-Koudsy on be-
half of the Pitt Nationality Room
Council was interrupted with wild
cheering. In accent-traced English
he explained that the Syrian and
Lebanese people wanted to show
they were happy because their “sons
and daughters who went to the west-
ern world and ‘made good’ went back
to the land of their forefathers.”
Active on NRC

Dr. Bitar was 1949 chairman of
the Nationality Rooms Council,
chairman of the Syria and Lebanon
Room Committee and also acted as
NIRC delegate to the 1949 UNESCO
conferenc c. He is a leader in the
Federation of Syria and Lebanon
Clubs of the eastern states, which
ordinarily holds its convention in
eastern U.S.

This year’s convention was
planned partly as an assurance to
the Iron-Curtain-shadowed people
of Syria and Lebanon that they still
had friends in the U.S.

An important personal reason for
Dr. Bitar’s trip was a visit with his
father. Mike Bitar, the Jenkins Ar-
cade dentist’s brother, also went
along. Mike, Gulf-station operator
from New Kensington, hadn’t seen
their father in 43 years.

Amazed dentist Bitar said, "My
father is 90 years old, but when I
saw him again he was chewing pea-
nuts with his own teeth, and he
wouldn't even let me look at them.
He showed me around the farm, jump-
ing fences almost like a boy of 17,
something I couldn’t do.”-

  Overset

By BOB THQMAS

It seems to me that this business
of sanctifying the Commons Room
has gone far enough.

TheCommons Room, for those who
don’t already know, is one of the
most beautiful and inspiring places
in the city, a great vaulted chamber
of stone and silence and marble on
the first floor of the Cathedral.

Also it is a crying waste of space
in probably the most compact uni-
versity building around. I

As far as I can see it has no
earthly use except to look at or
live in.

While anyone can look at the room,
different persons around the univer-
sity are making it as hard as pos-
sible to live inand put it to gainful
use.

Latest‘ Attempt Made

The latest attempt is that by
Commons Room Council or at least
that body’s vice president, Miss
Claire Zeligman. '

Miss Zeligman also wants to make

it as hard as possible for the students

to live in their Commons Room, that
is in the -sense that they would use
it for its avowed purpose of an in-
door campus.

She wants to hound them out and
ruin the campus aspects of the Com-
mons Room by making it illegal for
themto leave coats, books, lunches,
or other student accoutrements on
tables in the room.

Fina Proposed

Her proposal, presented to Men's
Council earlier, calls all these
things to be collected and carried
away to a ground floor room where
they could be redeemed on payment
of a ten cent fine.

So this is all wonderful. It will
clean up the room and it will be-
come a church again. It will not be
for the students, on which this

V school is founded after all.

The Lord knows there are enough
things around this students’ school

which are "hands-off” for these
same students.

We can’thave womencheerleaders.
We can't campaign for politics. We
can't dance in the Commons Room.
We can’t put a notice on the bulletin
board without getting permission, or
a personal notice of any sort. We
are not invited to walk on our own
campus grass.

Small Things Important

But these are small things,I guess,
and ones that will probably be re-
solved satisfactorily in time.

So along the same line I suppose
using the students’ Commons Room
for the students is a small thing.

But it is important. We wonder
why we don’t have school spirit.
Well, here's one reason. You can't
have spirit or warm feeling about
something which isn’t yours. A
school must be for the students.
Pitt is moving towards this realiza-
tion. For heaven's sake let’s not
backslide.

 

Learned Lit Profs

By MYRON KOPLEMAN

  

 

 

There is something about prof-

essors of literature that is re-
assuring to their students. I have
yet to meet one who does not con-
vey an impression of real learned-
ness.

Where, for instance, is the lite-
rature professor who does not
carry a brief case?

It matters not whether the prof-
essor has one or a dozen books to
lug around, he still must have his
brief case. Surely the thing is not
always full, for a literature prof-
essor's case is by nopmeans brief.
I have known literature teachers
whose cases could easily hold a
week’s supply of socks, under-
wear, neckties, and shirts.

Marital Troubles

Of course, this has its hard-
ships on the professors’ wives
who, rafter a breakfast spat, can
never be certain whether their
hubbies are off to deliver a lecture
on "The Implications of Faust’s
Goethe,” or walking out on them.

But then, I suppose one cannot

be a full-fledged member of the '

literati if he does not carry a brief
case. As a matter of fact, the sight
of a college literature class should
‘make any leather goods salesman’s
heart swell.

It seems that students who major
in the course must also carry at
least a junior-sized case. So if a

student passes you in the school »

hallway, casually swinging a brief
case i_n pendulum fashion so as to

belt you one in the thigh, you can
lay two tofive he is taking his major
in literature.

To Be Admired

Yet don’t think for a minute that
I am poking fun at these students.
I have only admiration for persons
who can contain themselves
throughout a lecture in literature.

It has been my experience that
literature professors will be lectur-
ing smoothly along when suddenly,
to prove a point, they will spring
something like this upon you:

“Recall, if you will, the fifth
canto of Dante's ‘Inferno’ --” This
makes me feel as ignorant as the
0. Henry character who found a
copy of Omar Kthayyam and casually
wondered if Ruby Ott was a good
looker. Yet as I glance around, my
fellow classmates with brief cases
appear to be having no trouble
whatever.

Some Consolation

To console myself in such si-
tuations, I like to think of Stephen
Leacock, who, in a poetic note to
his old professor, wrote:

“How gladly I would ask thee,
if] could,

One or two points I never under-
stood. .

You said one day that all our
judgments were

Synthetically a priori sir, --

I never doubted it, I never will.

I thought so then and I believe
it still,

Yet whisper into my ear intent
What did you say that a priori
meant?”

To which his teacher might, to
my mind, have replied:

Would you have me deliver in
commonplace English,

And leave barren the course that
is now so distinguished?

I have always used Latin, and
so let us let it,

For I learned the damned stuff at
ten dollars a credit.

 

  

Two Down, Two To Go . 

The departure of the Pitt Special trains and the band train to-

night mark the successful completion of two Pitt News-initiated
campaigns. Far from sitting back and complimenting ourselves,
we’d like to tackle some tougher projects, less popular, perhaps,
and less likely of immediate success. .

One such project, mentioned elsewhere on this page by Bob
Thomas, is one to ‘give Pitt backto the students.’ The oldfaculty
joke that ‘Pitt would be a fine place to work if they’d get rid of
the students’ is developing a few barbed realities that we’d like

to see removed.

5I=**

The second project (or campaign, or crusade, or whatever you
want to call it) is amuch broader one than we’ve attempted before.
Our efforts will constitute only a small part of a growing national
movement for college students to take the lead in ridding the
country of the curse of racial, religious, and class intolerance.

Call it a sensationalist crusade if you like. We’d prefer to
think of it as a policy, or even an ideal that the Pitt News en-

dorses.

The apparent gains, if any, will be small. We will probably
be criticized, even threatened (as we have been in the past)whe
individual groups get their toesstepped on. A

***

We feel, however, that there is a growing sentiment in the
nation, especially in its schools of higher learning, for a new
understanding among people of all classes, creeds, and colors,
and that the superficial bars set up by ignorance are ready for the

ax.

To this end we will use what means we have to suggest, sup-

port and publicize efforts to attain this common goal.

Letters to Editor

Editor,

I am writing in reference to the
list of major party candidates and
information that was printed in the
News Friday, Nov. 3. The article
states that the salary of a senator
is $25,000 per year. Actually, the
salary is $12,500 per year in addi-
tion to other involvments such as
a tax -- exempt expense allowance
of $2,500 (per yr.) and a travel
allowance of twenty cents per
mile of travel.

I realize that this inadvertent
error is one of little consequence.

However, the News has done such
an admirable job in informing the

On behalf of thelFreshman_Dance .

Committee, I wish to thank the Pitt
News for the fine publicity given

CO

the Homecoming Dance. Your
publicity added greatly to the suc-
cess of the dance. I also wish to
thank the Freshman Council for
the promotion of ticket sales, the
upperclassmen who acted as stu-
dent advisors, and the entire stu-
dent body for their grand support-,
without which this dance could not
have been successful. I sincerely
hope that the fine co-operation
given the freshman class will con-
tinue in the future. Thanks again.

Bob McGuire
Chairman of the Homecoming Dance

 

Editor
Pitt News

Since my college career at the
University is coming to an end, I
decided to mouth off once before I
leave.

For three-and-one-half years now
I have listened to such things as:
"We can't have a Christmas dance
in the Commons Room because it
is a most sacred place,” "We can’t
have girl cheerleaders or majorettes
because Miss Rushdidn’t have them
when she went to college in the
early nineteen hundreds,”etc. But
what I want to comment on. is the
band’s trip to Notre Dame.

I think there i's*no doubt that our
band is one of the best. The most
logical thing to do, therefore, would

be to show it off. But the Univer-
sityoffic ials send it to Northwestern
(‘which is farther away than Notre
Dame) instead ofrrsending it to
South Bend where the whole country I
could see it over television. Did
the school ‘perhaps have it planned
like this so that the students and
other contributors would bear some I
or all of the cost of sending it to 
1

South Bend?

I can only draw two conclusions 
from this: either the University of- 1
ficials are very clever, or they are 
very stupid. I would like to think it §
is the first, but from some previous
things they have done, I must con- .
sider both conclusions. . . .

Alvin Kinsel
College '51

Editor,
The Pitt News

Of course the Band should ac:
company the team to the Notre
Dame game. We hope our check will’
help accomplish the project. In’
addition to rewarding a splendid‘
organization, the trip and appear’
ance of the Band provides a good*
investment in the future of Pitt and
her students.

Best of luck and may the winning _
way continue. »

Panthers Braced for Notre Dame

 

IN ACTION TOMORROW - Quarterback Bobby Williams will be master-
l minding the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame tomorrow when they meet Pitt
Panther’s. Joe Bozek, a promising sophomore, will be at defensive end
for Coach Len Casanova’s boys.

IM CLINIC’ SET
There will be a combined meet-
ing and clinic for all intramural
basketball managers, officials,
and players at Trees Gym on
Wednesday at 4:30. Also asked.
to attend the meeting are the
managers of teams interested in
IM soccer and bowling.

Irish Harriers
Face Pitt

Pitt’s mediocre cross country
team, under coach Carl Olson, will
run against Notre Dame tomorrow
morning at 11 o'clock at South
Bend.

The Panther thinclads, losers in
their last two outings, must defeat
the Irish if they hope to finish the
season above the .500 mark. So far
they have won three and dropped
the same number.

The Irish, too, sport a so-so_»re-

cord. Without a senior on the squad,
Notre Dame coach Alex Wilson has

had to depend mainly on a flock of
sophomores.

Two sophomores, Bernie Luter-
ancik and Bob Pastorius, have
sparked the Panthers in recent
meets. Ken Mahanna, a junior, got
off to a flying start early in the
season, but couldn’t keep up the
fast pace. If these three boys could
show the form Olson expected of
them, then perhaps the cross country
team could come home with the
bacon.

Phi Eps (5-0) and Pi Kappa Alpha
(5-0) battled to a 12-12 stalemate.

Both teams had two opportunities
to push over the points after touch-
down but failed to do so from their
pass formations.

The Eps and the PiKA’s,, front-
runners in Section I of the Frater-
nity League, are assured playoff
berths in their quest for the IM
trophy.

The PiKA’s took advantage of
two breaks in the first half to
score their 12 markers. Marty Kohr
scored on a 25 yard passland Al
Locnikar went over from the five
on a pitchout from Ron Livingston.

The Phi Eps charged back in

son Capp is the only Panther to
score more than once.
Others who have tallied are Bill
: Sichko, Armand DiFonso, Bob
Bestwick, Bob Osterhout, George
Glagola, Chris Warriner, Nick De
Rosa, and Bill Reynolds.
I i h

Things certainly have changed
this year for the Irish. Once upon
a time, a third-string man on :2
Notre Dame team was eyed by the
pros as possible material.

Now, however, news releases
say that Captain and Center
Jerry Groom and End Jim Mut-
scheller have averaged 50 min-
utes per game as “iron men,"
due to the “lack of depth on the
Notre Dame squad.”

U i U

Naturally there are Pennsylva
nians on the Notre Dame team. Ten
gridders hail‘from the Keystone
State. Two are from Pittsburgh.

Joe Capp, by smashing over for two touchdowns last week, now

the second half for two touchdowns.
Mickey Steiner pitched to Cyril
Wecht for the first Ep TD. The
final score came with but a minute
to play as Sam Shapiro blocked a
PiKA punt. Two plays later Steiner
had completed a touchdown pass to
Al Finesman.

The Pitt-Notre Dame grid series
began back in 1909. The Irish, in
17 games with the Panthers, have
defeated the Blue-and-Gold 11
times.

In the good old days, between
1932 and 1937, Pitt took the
measure of the Fighting Irish five
out of six times.

The last seven modern grid con-
tests have all ended with the Notre_
Dame Victory March being sung.

The last meeting between the
two schools came in 1948, when

Johnny Lujack & Co. ripped‘ Pitt.

Irish Have ‘Iron Man”

Notre Dame’s captain and center,
Jerry Groom, is a stickler for ac-
curacy. Groom played ovér 59 min-
utes against Navy last week, and
press observers wondered if he

.hadn’t played the whole game. "Why,

no, I didn’t play the full game,”
said Jerry. “I was out for two ofthe

and center, doubling up. This tact-
ical stratagem enabled the Irish to
weather the early Navy storm and
go at full speed with theirstrongest
combination on the field atall times
in the second half. I

Irish Line outplayed

Navy’sline which outplayed Notre
Dame’s in the early going, could
not stand up for the whole distance
and gave ground in the second half.
Notre Dame did all its gaining in-
side the tackles while keeping its
own middle solidly plugged.

Pitt hasn't done too badly in
holding the opponents’ ground
attacks

after the Ohio State debacle, and
should give the Irish runners
trouble.

Petitbon Leads Attack

Johnny Petitbon spearheads the
running attack and has averaged
7.5 yards per carry, better than last
year's Six-yard Emil Sitko.

Pitt’s injurylist shows that Guard
Mike Boldin and Halfback Tony
Simile are fully recovered after
missing last week’s game, and are
ready to go tomorrow. Tackle Bob
Brennen and Halfback Armand Di-
Fonso are still listed as doubtful.

In practice this week, Casanova
has been laying off Scrimmages,
putting emphasis on light drills and
calesthenics. The team left this
.morning by plane for South Bend
where they have a workout scheduled
for this afternoon.

The Grade

Leahy Finally Makes

I  ‘mom NEWS-Friday, November 210, 1950-Page 6

  

By MIYRON KOPELMAN

Sports Editor

Professor Frank Leahy, the poor, misfortunate being who
teaches Football 1-AR at Notre Dame University, must be feeling

happy, for a change, these days.

It is human nature to be delight-
ed with one’s self when you pre-
dict a turn of events correctly.

~After many years of trying, Prof-

essor Leahy has finally made the
grade by foreseeing with marvelous
acumen that his students would be
lousy this year. Every year Fret-
ting Frank would make that predic-
tion," and every year his boys would
double-cross him.

At last the Coach must be a
happy man.

Feared Pitt

I can remember back in 1948
when Tears brought his team to
Pittsburgh for one of those games
which particularly worried him. The
Irish, you see, had won only 19
straight, while Pitt had been vic-
torious once in its last ten tries.

Two days before the game, the
following headline streaked across
a South Bend newspaper: "LEAHY
FEARS PITT.”

As matters turned out, Pitt prov-
ed so fearsome that Leady had to
play his scrubs almost half the
game to hold the score down to
40-0. After the whitewash ended,

from Poor Frank, remembering, of
course, to don my raincoat in the
event that I might have to venture
within gushing range of his glands.

Deiocfed

I found him sitting dejectedly on
a bench in the corner of the room,
his chin resting in the palms of
his hands and his eyes staring
blankly at the floor.

Tapping him on the shoulder, I
introduced myself and asked him
what he thought was the chief fac-
tor in his team’s 40-0 triumph. He
looked up at me, his eyes dead-
serious, and muttered:

"Luck 0' the Irish, m’ boy, luck
0’ the Irish.”

Wicks Sta rs
As Psi O’s Win

By DAVE GRUTJOHAN

After a grudge battle with the
Delta Sigs Monday evening at Schen-
ley Oval, the Psi O’s remained top
team on the Professional totem pole
as they won by a decisive 27-6
score.

Bob Wicks was the chief tormentor
of the Delta Sigs as he threw for
four touchdowns, one of them in
total darkness at the end of the
game.

Wick's passes were to Bud Rem-
aley, Bob Fotner, and two to Jack
Kerns. The Delta Sigs only touch-
down was a third quarter pass from
Joe Cole to Fred Ammon.

The first half showed signs of
the battle for blood developing into
a close game. But the final half
made it clear that no such game
was to be’ played.

One touchdown by the Psi O’s
in the third quarter and two more
in the fourth killed all chances for
a close contest.

Job Prospects for Engineers
Looking Up, Dean Reports

A serious shortage of engineers has developed and opportu-
nities are plentiful for Feb. and June 1951 engineering graduates,

according to C. H. Ebert, director

This shortage was not apparent
six months ago when the Bureau
was concerned about placing the

‘ 1951 graduates Ebert said.

"Now it appears beyond a doubt
that no placement problem will
exist,” he added.

A group of selected companies
have just conducted interviews on
the eighth floor for placement of
the engineer graduates.

These companies which include
RCA Victor, International Busi-
ness Machine, General Electric,
and Westinghouse, are now hiring
the graduates although they realize
they will lose them if they are
called to military service, Ebert
pointed out.

It was also stated that the
starting salaries for new engi-
neers have slightly exceeded those
of previous years.

Instrumental in causing the en-
gineer. shortage, the School of
Engineering has suffered an en-
rollment drop this year, the regist-
rar’s office reported.

Deans Back
Cleanup

Dean of Women Helen P. Rush have
thrown their weight behind the drive
by Commons Room Council to clean
up the Commons Room.

Dean Rush expressed her belief
that, “The condition of the Com-
mons Room shows a lack of social
responsibility by the students. Be-
cause the Commons Room stands as
a symbol of the University, it is
important that it be kept in a neat
and orderly fashion.”

A plan proposed by the Council
would include both publicity and
enforcement measures.

 

Eileen Success

At Box Office

"My Sister Eileen,” the recent

Pitt Players production, was a
"huge success,” according to
Leonard Briskin, business manager.

With a total attendance of 1250
persons, 1100 of which were paid
admissions, the outlook for the
season is very bright. This year's
attendance will probably exceed
last year's high figures.

The next Players’ production,
"Beggar on Horseback," is a
comedy. The show, directed by

Barry Farnol, will be given in the
middle of January.

ight are the famous keys of national honor societies.

No. 9 is an important newcomer. It’s the Bell System’s new keyset for
the ‘direct dialing of Long Distance telephone calls. And, though not yet

“national,” it already has “chapters” in more than 900 cities and towns.

By pressing these keys, your operator can dial calls straight through to tele-
phones in many distant places. Calls go through faster, more accurately.

Automatic dialing of Long Distance calls by operators, a development of the
Bell Telephone Laboratories, is being extended steadily. This new method of
putting through Long Distance calls is especially important right now, when

the nation is counting on telephone service to help speed the job of defense.

Two Seniors

Win Awards

The $300 Borden Scholarship
Award in Pharmacy was split be-
tween two seniors in the School of
Pharmacy last Monday morning.
Shirley D. Sussman and William H.
Gerdes were the co-recipients of
the award.

The presentation took place
Monday, Nov. 6, in room 324 C1.
Chancellor R. H. Fitzgerald
presented Miss Sussman and Mr.
Gerdes with checks for $150 and
award certificates at a ceremony
in 324 C1.

This is the third year this award
has been made, and the first that
it has had to be divided between

‘two people. In past years only one

student was named.
The Borden Scholarship Award

' is presented to the first semester

senior who has the highest quality
point average for all preceding
work.

Miss Sussman is a graduate of
Aliquippa High School and resides
in Aliquippa.

Mr. Gerdes graduated from
Springdale High School in 1944.
He is a veteran of World War 11,
having served twenty-nine months
with the eighty-second air-borne
division. He now lives in New
Kensington, Pa.
