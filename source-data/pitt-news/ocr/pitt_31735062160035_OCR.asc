Pitt Poll Finds

Registration Change
Meets Mixed Opinions

By ELINORE STONE

Last week, every student at
the University of Pittsburgh went
through an ordeal called regis-
tration.

When questioned as to the dif-
ference between this last regis-
tration and previous ones, the
reactions were varied.

In the opinion of Jim Leder,
College "53, Pitt is “regressing
instead of progressing” in its
registration system. “I think we
should go back to the old pre-
registration method. I found this

arrangement very confusing.”

REGISTRATION CASUALTY?—Nope, the student above

Lois Pounds, C o l I e g e ’54,
worked for the registrar’s office
and found it very “easy” to pick
up all her class cards.

Jim Cresto, College ’54, thought
there wasn’t much difference. “I
got all my cards and the entire
process took only two hours and
ten minutes,” he said. \

College senior Irving Green-
berg replied, “It only took me
three days to register.”

Another senior, Josephine Mus-
tari complained, “It took me

longer than when I was a fresh-
man.”

Critic Sees ‘Candida’- as Poor

if.) ilmpra ve Relations 

The newly-created position of vice chancellor is another
indication‘ of the University’s growth and of the increasing
complexity of the education business. Dr. Nutting should

.  help make this growth a smoother and more efficient opera-

tion; he should be able to free the Chancellor of many
onerous duties which have fallen on his shoulders since the

A  war ended. ‘

We hope that the other vice chancellor whose name

‘A  may soon be released will devote most of his time to stu-

dent-administration relations. For while Dr. ‘Fitzgerald’s
leadership has gained Pitt greater stature in the nation, it

sf .has resulted in removing the administration from contact
...with the student body.

Students are like most people. They like to see the
men who are leading them and, perhaps, even talk .to them.

A ‘ They don’t want to feel that they are just customers.

‘We hope the new Vice chancellors will make us feel‘
more at home. i

  Bra tllerllaotl Re visited ‘

With National Brotherhood Week beginning next’ Mon-

-7 day and Religion-in-Life Week following shortly after, the

Student Congress committee investigating discrimination
on campus-i-should ﬁnd plenty of moral support for its work.

The legislators might speed up their investigations-so
as to have a fairly complete report to give during next
Week’s activities.

~ go to make» that week a victorious celebration. ’,

We hope that the semester vacation has not proved’

too long a break in the probe. This sometimes happens

renew the_ ﬁn'e work they were doinglast January.

part of the plan must be in charge

of the University. So, since Pitt
is going to get a second vice
chancellor anyway, I am propos-
ing that he be specially desig-

nated “Vice Chancellor in Charge -

of Pep.”
Will Do Paper Work

This VCICOP can handle all
investigations, probes, searches,
undercover work, and most of
the tiresome paper work that will
be necessary to sell and ﬁrmly
implant PEP here at Pitt.

To further strengthen the posi-
tion of PEP at the University,
and to /disseminate its blessings
to the greatest number of stu-
dents, it will be necessary to re-
organize the offices of the dean of

,men and the dean of women

somewhat. ‘

It will be a simple turnover,
merely requiring the addition of
an “assistant dean in charge of
PEP” to each oﬂ'ice. This will be
a most important cog in the over-
all setup.

For the ADICOP must take
complete charge of properly ori-
enting all freshmen in ‘the glories
of PEP. There are'certain ways
by which this can ‘best be done:

Whether to be a specialist or a
“universal man” has been a
choice which students have had

choicewhich has become more

Not only has the matter of a

Registration is a fertile ﬁeld
"for the psychology department.
A few minutes every day at key

poinﬁts and they would get enough
human reactions to ﬁll two or
three books on abnormal psy-
chology. Of course, anyone who
isn’t abnormal at registration
isn’t normal because“ the ordeal
affects even the sanest students.

Take for example the simple
act of picking» up your /semester
grades. Do students take them
and quietly. walk away? No,
they’ve got to make some com-
ment like, “I’m going to commit
suicide!” Or—and psychologists
take note—the reaction of stu-
dents when they get all B’s:
“Look what I made,” they’ll say,
jumping for joy.

But when they get three C’s ».

— always, “Look what that idiot

As a matter of fact, at this last

It’s a ready built maze and they

having to buy so many rats.

Military Influence

The military inﬂuence rears
its ugly head in registration, too.
If you didn’t know better you
would think the planners of reg-
istration were preparing for the
invasion of Normandy. Special
telephones are i.nstal1ed in all
rooms; a room with the sinister
name of “coding” is set up on
the ﬁrst floor, and then there is
the “machine” room, and a “pre-
check,” and “ﬁnal check” point.

each must be innoculated with a
high-powered, fast-talking virus
which will insure a maximum of
PEP until the day he graduates.
(The assistance of the zoology
department will be necessary to
discover this virus.”)

3. At registration, each fresh-
man must be supplied with the
Handy Handbook of Handy PEP
slogans. The book can be,,con-
sulted for conversations,
speeches, classes, exams, and in-
formal bull sessions. Each fresh-
man must be _warned to memor-
ize the contents of the handbook.

4. The ADICOP must also take

the responsibility for organizing _

a Faculty Auxiliary to the PEP
Committee. The ADICOP will
also have to orient the FATTPC
in its prime function, that of in.-
troducing PEP to the classroom.

Turn ‘Em. Loose

After this intensive PEP orien-
tation program, the freshman
must be turnedloose at foptball
and basketball games to shout his
guts loose for the alma smater.

The din, I expect, will be ter- ~

riﬁc.

From time to time the special
PEP innoculations will twinge
in his veins. Once-or twice the
special Non-PEP vaccine will
throb in his arteries. But soon
the twinges and throbs will leave.

The school will turn quiet and
musty again.

Everyone will be happy.

the professionals are interested
more in security than theyare in

Yet it is the professionals who
are the most vociferous support-
ers of individualism. One of the
chief arguments against social-
ized medicine is that it is a threat
against the individual, that it
weakens the m‘oral_ﬁber, that it
expresses only a wishy-washy
yearning for security. i '

It would be difficult to prove.

that the doctor himself is not pri-
marily interested in security, that
he is not of thestrongest moral
ﬁber and that his opposition to

socialized medicine is not his own:

expression of a desire to main-
tain his security.

Rules of The Line

Standing in line is like a game,
and, as spch, has its rules. Ex-
perts .on the subject, those who
have suffered through! four or
more registrations, have set up‘
the following“ regulations:

1) You do not speak to those in
front or behind you. Fold your
arms, stare silently at the walls,
and move at the prescribed speed

of two and one quarter feet every I

ﬁfteen minutes; A

2) It is permissable to bring
books to read, or oil paints to
while away the time. Pocket
books with racy covers are not
permitted past the ﬁrst check.
3) Finally, you are not allowed
to break ranks and attempt an
escape. Any such action" will be
construed as pure cowardice on
your part, and if everybody else
must register, so should you.

A Lahar To Accept Football. Post

Soon

Only Salary*Holds Up

Dawson’s Line Coach

. By BORIS WEINSTEIN

When Pitt oﬂicials and Harold Lahar ﬁnally get together
on salary terms, the West Virginia line coach will assume a
similar post here under Head Football Coach Red Dawson.

Lahar revealed in a telephone conversation Monday with
Frank Carver, athletic publicity director, that “no decision
has been reached as yet.” It’s certain, however, that Dawson
wants the former Oklahoma and professional Buffalo Bill
star as his line coach next season: 1

Salary terms were not disclosed
by the athletic ofﬁce. But the an-
nouncement of Lahar’s acceptance
is expected shortly.

Hokuf Leaves

At that time Dawson will proba-
bly make a blanket announcement
concerning the rest of his coach-
ing staff. Capt. Tom Hamilton_’s
entire board of assistants——with
the 'exeception of the departed
Steve Hokuf-—will be retained by
the new head coach.

Hokuf, line coach last year, has
since accepted the head coaching
position at Lafayette College.

Lahar Only Interviewee

Lahar was the only ‘outsider’ in-
terviewed formally by Dawson for
the line coaching job. Last year’s
assistants also had conferences
with the new head mentor when
he arrived here from East Lansing.

After playing three ‘years of col-
legiate football at Oklahoma in
1938, ’39, ’40, Lahar moved into
professional ball with the Chicago
Bears. He also played at Buffalo
after the war when Dawson was
head coach. - ‘

In 1949 Lahar was an assistant
at Tennessee and for the last two
years coached the line at West
Virginia.

Cagers Lose
Frosh Comers .

Dr. H. C. Carlson’s hoopsters
will play the last four games of
their 22-game schedule without
the services of two freshman com-
ers—Jim McClure and Bob Bing-
ham. .

They have been dropped from
the University because of poor
grades. _ ,

McClure, 6-3, 198 pounder from
Cresson, was one of Carlson’s
most highly-rated freshmen. He
appeared in 12 games and scor-
ed 2l points on 7 ﬂeld goals and
7 fouls for the Varsity.‘

Hit For 94 Points

Bingham, 6-0 southpaw from
Wellsville, Ohio, performed for the
Frosh-JV unit under Dodo Can-
terna and more recently Edgar
Jones. He appeared in only a
few varsity games this winter.

His total of 94 points was sec- ’

ond best among the reserves.
Bingham scored 39 ﬁeld goals and
16 fouls.

. Doc Carlson’s cagers may not be dead—theyf«ve won eight
_games——but their home base, the Memorial l'1_‘ield House, could
easily be called the Memorial Morgue. "
Basketball fans led by a lifeless student body sit back
and prepare to watch a basketball game unphased by the

hoopsters’ activities.

The spectators are rapidly deemphasizing basketball at
Pitt through their lethargic actions.¢'

At the Pitt-Westminster game a
few fans were observed reading
newspapers totally unaware that
Pitt had jumped off to a twelve
point lead.’

Gable in Disguise .

Even the ﬁery Carlson, who in-
sists that the officiating hasn’t im-
proved at Pitt games this year, has
settled down to a state of calm-
ness at the Field House.

But on the road he appears to
have regained himself.

During the North Carolina
State game he was the recipient
of two technical fouls and caused
the referee to say, “He and his
big mouth. He ought to be in
Hollywood, he acts the part. If
he doesn’t wise , up, I’ll throw
the whole ball club out on fouls.”

As a result 34 personals were

i ’called‘on'Pitt and only 17 on the

home team.

Workman Worked Over
At the Field House, though, the

Panthers have been getting ther

breaks from the officiating body.

«Against West. Virginia the Pitts

were . ~trip1eteaming .Mark Work-
man, elbowing him, hacking at
him, and in general creating a

small war with the Mountaineer
All-American. But few fouls were
called on his antagonists.

But at Raleigh even Pitt’sa
scorekeeper Harvey Rabinowitz
was treated with Southern in-
gratitutde. It’s general policy
and also a NCAA rule that the
visiting scorekeeper, if present,
be the oﬁicial scorer.

Yet when . Rabinowitz protested
that the referee appointed the
home team as ofﬁcial, hewas de-
nied the right as set by the NCAA.
At \ halftime the. umpire agreed
with Rabinowitz but said that
‘down here they do things differ-
ent.’

Burch Among Leaders"

The unimpressive Panthers,
however, have hit the national
spotlight. As of Feb. 2, Mickey
Zernich was 38th in the country in
the individual point-getting race.
Clarence Burch was ranked 13th
in the nation in assists with 65 in.
14 games. .. ‘

Since then, however, he has
topped his previous game high
with 14 assists against Geneva
and the same number against
‘Westminster. He now has 98 as-
sists in 18 games.

Methodist Sorority

Easter is celebrated in and un-
usual way by one of the oldest re-
ligious groups on campus.

At their last meeting‘ before
Easter, Kappa Phi, the National

_Methodist..sorority, follows its na-

tional custom by enacting the Last
Supper in a service called “The
Meal In The Upper Room.”

The setting is patterned after the
Bible record of the feast, and the

food closely resemb1es,what re-

corded history says Christ and His

_ , apostles ate.

Lamb and Matzos Served

The Women’s Society of Chris- ,
tian Service provides the free meal ~
- of lamb, matzos, olives, grapes,

grape juice, and unleavened bread.

The meal is eaten in silence, but
club members assuming» biblical
roles read scripture aloud during

the service. v

contacts, but no one to talk to
them!”

terested students should apply be-
fore next Wednesday, Feb. 20.

Students Disagree

On Registration

(Continued from Page 5)

Betty Pickering, College ’54,
who expected “positive bedlam"
was pleasantly surprised at the
smoothness of the operation.

Bus. Ad. sophomore, Bill Stern
remarked, “I had an easy time but
prefer pre—registration. I could
have worked an extra day rather
than come down to school.”

Another senior, Jim Rock, had.
no difficulty getting class cards,
but did add, “the system of advis-
ing at registration is very poor.
There should be more men there to
advise students on specific ﬁelds
and major subjects.”

Pat Ritz, College ’54, found reg-
istration “just as confusing as in
September. I made my schedule
up beforehand and didn’t get one
card I wanted.”

Elizabeth Vaughn, College ’54,
prefers pre—registration and thinks
that it would be a “good idea to
register by mail.”

An entering College freshman, '

Phyliss Black, said, “I never went
through anything like it before.
There’s no way to get help in mak-
ing out—y,our schedule beforehand
and I didn’t get one class I want-
ed.”

Another mid-year entrant, Bar-
bara Humphreys found the whole
business “confusing and the rooms
very stuffy.”

Adopting a more optimistic
viewpoint, Charles Vaughan, Col-
lege ’52 replied, “I had relatively
no trouble.
