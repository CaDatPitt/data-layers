After two female students reported that they
were raped by acquaintances last weekend, mem-
bers of Pitt’s Sexual Assault Services say people
need to know that communication can often pre
vent such attacks from happening. ' .

“The most important thing men and women
need‘ to know is how to communicate more effec-
tively,” said Mary Ruiz, head of Sexual Assault
Services. “Be up front with one another. Men
need to be direct and say, ‘I want to sleep with
you,’ instead of just assuming it’s OK.”

Sexual Assault Services provides individual
and group counseling to victims of _ sexual
attacks. It also provides emergency medical,
legal and police assistance.

The women reported that the attacks
occurred in Lothrop Hall on Friday after each

signed her alleged assailant into the dorm and .

took ‘him to her room. The attacks are not relat-
ed according to Gary Moses, deputy chief of the
Pitt Police. ‘ " ‘

Staff Writer

Author and Pitt
alumna Bebe Moore
Campbell visited the
University last night to
talk about her message
of hope for racial equal-
ity and overcoming set-
backs in life.

"As African
Americans, we can
obtain it and live it. We
have a lot of work to do
and it's time to get start-
ed," she said.

Campbell was a
founding member ‘of the
Black Action Society at
Pitt while a student in
the late '60s and early
'70s, and was also

involved in a protest to
have more African
Americans admitted to
the University.

"When I found out a
member of the Black
Action Society was
going to pick me up
from the airport, it
swelled my heart to see
that the work I helped to
start 30 years ago is still
going strong," Campbell
said.

Campbell earned a
Bachelor of Science
degree from Pitt in ele-
mentary education, and
attributes much of her
success to the
University.

"My mother was a
storyteller, so she plant-

ed the seed [for my writ-
ing], and Pitt watered it.
Coming to Pitt forced
me to meet and interact
with people," Campbell
said, "although it was a
time of unrest and
action."

A former elementary
and middle
teacher, Campbell has
authored four. books:
"Sweet Summer:
Growing Up With and
Without My Dad," a
memoir about her child-
hood and early adult

abusing prostitute.

Demonstrators with signs read-

her guests tell the truth as they

Authorities said she was caught
again early this morning, in a car

Letourneau was under court
orders not to see the youth.

Her attorney_said this "was very

RAPE

arrested for one of the attacks. The
other alleged rapist has been identi-
fied, but charges have not been
pressed.

Pitt student Christa Douaihy, who
teaches fraternities, sororities and
freshman studies classes about date
and acquaintance rape for Sexual
Assault Services, agrees that talking
can be one of the best ways to pre-
vent sexual assault.

“We need to be assertive and
express our limits and boundaries,”
she said.

Most rapes at Pitt, according to
Ruiz, can be lumped together because
they share the same characteristics: a
man almost always assaults a woman;
most cases go unreported; a majority
of the women never press charges;
and nearly every case involves both
persons having consumed alcohol.

Starke met his alleged victim in
an Oakland bar before they returned
to her dorm. Police arrested him later
that night for drunken driving, and he
was identified as the attacker early
Saturday. '

“There needs to be more concern
at Pitt for students and how much
they drink,” said Ruiz. She stressed
that students need to be more respon-
sible because alcohol lowers a per-
son’s inhibitions and prevents clear
thinking.

Douaihy said it is futile to tell
college students not to drink at all,
but they can learn how to drink
responsibly and avoid possible sexu-
al assault situations.

“You should have friends look

, THE PITT. NEWS

out for you,” she said. “Be aware of
your environment and your friends,
and stick with them.”

Ruiz added that students should
always watch their drinks to prevent
someone from slipping in drugs,
including Rohypnol —— the infamous
date rape drug.

She said she has so far only seen
one rape at Pitt involving Rohypnol,
but that doesn’t mean students should
lower their defenses.

Ruiz said both men and women
who are victims of sexual assault
often cannot get through their ordeal
without counseling and guidance.

She encourages any sex crime
victim to seek the help of her organi-
zation. ,

“Don’t feel alone. Come in to the
office because it’s confidential, and
that doesn’t mean you have to press
charges,” said Ruiz. “We don’t push
people; we help them become aware
of all their [options].”

Ruiz said that one woman per
week and about one man per year vis-
its Sexual Assault Services, but that
the numbers of students sexually
assaulted vastly exceed those figures.

“Men don’t come forward
because there’s an element of shame
because they’ve been socially condi-
tioned to be able to protect them-
selves,” said Ruiz. “We want every-
one to know that Sexual Assault
Services is for men and women.”

1 Douaihy agreed, and said no one
is invincible.

“The best advice for women and
men is remember to use common
sense —~ it can happen to you whether
you’re a man or a woman.”

Anti-frat fraternity
not threatening

Pitt student Matt DiMarco has taken up the gaunt-
let to ﬁght evil on this campus.

Or so he thinks.

DiMarco is the founder of an unofﬁcial student
organization called the “Anti-Fratemal Council” —— a
small brotherhood dedicated to the ﬁght against
brotherhoods.

They post signs around campus urging students to
ignore the signs around campus. They tell people not
to join a fraternity or sorority, so as not to let others
tell them what to do. -

DiMarco’s AFC is pretty harmless, really. We can
probably expectat least another 13 years of IFC dom-
inance before he convinces a single person not to join
the Greek system with these ﬂyers. In fact, the only
people who seem to take him seriously are already in
the Greek system. DiMarco says at least one group
has threatened him physically.

Don’t bother threatening him. He has a small fol-
lowing that’s not likely to grow very much. In fact,
the. more Greeks acknowledge him, the more harm
they do to themselves.

Think of this guy as the leader of a segregationist
fraternity. He’s a lot of smoke and steam, and given
the chance, he’d probably like to organize a march in
front of the Cathedral. Greeks would probably want
to stage a counter-protest in front of the Union. But
that would be giving him too much acknowledge-
ment. The next thing you know, we have the Fraternal
Order of Police putting up a barrier to keep the
groups apart.

The best thing Greeks could do for their own
interest would be to just ignore him. _

Plenty of students will participate in rush every
year. For all the stereotypes of fraternities and sorori-
ties — many of which are partly true — the Greek
system remains a big part of college life for many
kids. A major reason students come to a big university
is to meet a lot of people. Joining a fraternity is just
one of many ways to do that. '

This newspaper does not advocate the Greek path,
nor does it condemn it. It’s always good to have-
options. And DiMarco is just exercising one of his
options: He does have the right to his opinion and to
express itappropriately.

Fraternities may be an easy target for bashing, but
if that’s really important to him, so be it. And if he
picks up a few stragglers along the way, well, you and
they would probably be happier in the end, anyway.

Bill's busy taking care of our business

Tani

Buck

So I actually spent the
other night in front of my tele-
vision ' watching Clinton’s
State of the Union Address.
I’m pleased to say that it was
not a waste of my time.

Of concern to all of us is:

1) the new tax credit '
' offered to families with chil-

dren in college. I know my
mother is thrilled that she’ll be
able to receive yet another
deduction for bringing me into
this world. Thank goodness the
Clinton’s are sending Chelsea
to college the year this goes
into effect — it’s good to have
a sympathizer in office.

2) Applying surplus
monies to Social Security pro-
grams is a brilliant idea. Of
course, the “Geezer or Prude”
(GOP) isn’t concerned one bit
as to whether our generation
will receive Social Security
benefits when it’s our turn:
They’ll be long gone when that

time rolls around. (They just .

think we’re do-nothing pot-
heads anyway.)

3) The fact that there will i
even be a surplus of monies in

the near future is a remarkable
accomplishment for Clinton.
I’m certain that if Bush (in
‘92) or Dole had been elected
there wouldn’t even be the

possibility of debate over.

where these monies should go.

A lot of you right now
probably aren’t very con-
cerned with receiving Social
Security — you should be

extremely concerned. You
never know where you’ll be in
45 years or so. You may have
worked in a job that provides
an attractive retirement pro-
gram, or you may have only
been able to find employment
at K-Mart.

Laugh. That could be you
announcing the next “Blue
Light Special.” It’s really not
that funny._ K-Mart most likely
does not offer the most attrac-
tive 401K plan. Social
Security will be your main
provider in your old age. I
want to make damn sure that
it’s there for me and everyone
else when our time comes.

Republicans who want to
divvy up the money now to all
citizens are out of their minds.
Leave it to the old folks on the
Hill to not look any further
into the future than the end of
their terms. Years of honest
hard work deserve a little more
than a check next month (or
whenever they’re trying to do
this) .for a fraction of the sur-
plus money. Just how much do
they think each citizen will
receive? I’m willing to wager
it won’t be too much more than
five_bucks.

Growing up in a blue col-
lar family, like the majority of
the US population, has given
me the appreciation of Social
Security-. There may be no
money to pay for Grandma’s
burial, her two-month long
hospital stays, or even her gro-
cery bills without the benefits
of Social Security. Her steel-
worker son may not be able to

THE PITT NEWS

make his own ends meet, let
alone his mother’s.

Some ass is saying, “It’s
not my responsibility to pay
for that, either.” It wasn’t her
responsibility , to rivet planes
together at Westinghouse,
either, was it? So what do we
do with Grandma? I say, when
she dies, we should ship her to
the Republican Headquarters
and let them figure it out.

Certainly Clinton is not the
greatest of all US Presidents,
but he and the Democratic
Party are compassionate and

concerned for the welfare of ‘

all citizens. This was ’made
beautifully apparent in last
week’s address. It’s not just the
money-hungry corporations
and the white-haired rich who

‘are ‘of importance to our

nation, though they certainly
spend a great deal of time
thinking so.

It makes me sick to hear.
certain Pitt students call
Clinton a “bleeding heart lib-
eral,” when all he’s trying to
do is make life easier, for those
who’ve never had anything
easy. If you insist upon going
through life grabbing every-
thing for yourself and sharing
nothing, there’s not going to be
anyone or anything to help you
when the chips are down.

Bill Clinton has the clear-

est conscience of anyone I_

know.

Republicans should move) to
Iraq and leave the United
States alone. -

Not really dirty until it stands by itself

tively recycling our clothes through’

Our lives are a lot like piles of
dirty laundry: Some of us just sit
around, others whirl through like
they’re in a spin cycle, but no matter
what, we all eventually go through
the ringer.

And if you try to deny it, just
remember laundry day.

There is a sense of impending
dread in every college student’s life
that grows as slowly and steadily as
the pile of soiled socks and dunga-
rees in the bathroom hamper.

Laundry day is a pretty terrify-

involves handling items of clothing
that have fermented to a point more
noxious than many military chemi-
cal-weapon gasses,
but because of the
trip to that scariest of
scary places: the
laundromat.

When you figure
that the laundromat is
a place that combines
the humidity of a jun-

smell of a New York City subway
coated in Colorsafe Fab, it’s no
wonder this is a traumatic experi-

This experience, however, is
especially emotionally-scarring for
collegiate men.

We often look forward to wash-

reading about the latest advances in
dress hemming or attending a

CampusFunds
scam should
be nixed S 0

After reading The Pin‘ News article
regarding CampusFunds, I’m mystiﬁed as
to why students even take part in the pro-
gram. CampusFunds doesn’t seem to offer
any advantages that a student can’t get
simply from using a check or debit card.

The editors, rather than asking the
University to expand the program, should
be asking the students why they allow the
University to take advantage of them.
Students are letting the University hold
their money (and probably collect interest
on it), track their spending habits and limit
their spending choices. The University
also needs to maintain the Ca1npusFunds
network, a cost passed along to students.

Back when CampusFunds was called
Choice Dollars, there was some justiﬁca-

. - » / / ; . , . , . . .

tion for the program. Students were limit-
ed to using their Choice Dollars in places
that sold food, which meant that a stu-
dent’s parents could put money on Choice
Dollars for them and be sure they were
spending it on food. Now that the ability
for a vendor to take CampusFunds is lim-
ited only by the vendor’s willingness to
“ lay ball” with the University, the pro-
gram no longer serves a useful service.

It should be re-evaluated or disband-
ed.

Flat tax woul
benefit more
than just the rich

Once again, Michael Berquist is
spreading untruths about
Republican proposals.

Repeating what he wrote in an
article from Nov. 1995, he has once
again claimed that Dick Armey’s
ﬂat tax proposal is non—progressiv/e.
This is completely untrue.

- - ; r : / t o / , ¢ I . , 4 / / 2 .

  

. r . . . , . r .

According to Armey’s book’,-
“The Freedom Revolution,”. the
proposal has large exemptions.;=

There is an untaxed"a1lowance.of=

$13,100 for an individual, $26,200;
for a married couple and an addi-
tional $5,300 for each dependent-
child. This allowance means low

_income families would pay. no.

income tax at all, and incomes
above that level would ‘be taxed"
progressively. 

For instance, after the exemp-.
tion, a family of four 'making-

$50,000 would pay about 5 percent.-

of total income, while a family
making $200,000 would pay 14 per-
cent.

Berquist may disagree with hav-1’?
ing a system of fair, low taxes, but;

he should at least try to correctly}

report’ the views of his opponents. _;_

Nagano gives
a bad case of
Olympic fever

Countdown to Nagano.

Turn on CBS, and before you can
say “Nash Bridges,” a commercial
pops up with the countdown to
Nagano.

For those of you who do not
watch CBS — and according to the
most recent Nielsen ratings, quite a
few of you exist — Nagano, Japan
will host the 1998 Winter Olympics.

And for those of you who do not
watch television, read books, scan
newspapers, surf _the web or leave

serves as a February showcase for
new television commercials, cool
graphics and, every so often, athletes
—- allowing you, the viewer, to
chance to catch Olympic fever to
match the inﬂuenza and hacking
cough that always ﬂoat around come
February. V

In 1994, people cheered the com-
ing games, primarily so the Tonya
Harding-Nancy Kerrigan soap opera
could finally play itself to a climax.
It ended in the most—watched event
of sweeps month —— a skating final
that. went down to the wire and fea-
tured bootlace snaps, tears and a
Russian gold medalist that ruined the
storybook ending.

But that still puts the ‘94 games a
step ahead of this year’s incarnation
—— four years ago, at least the games
had a story. A tabloid story, but still
a story.

This year, creating a story has
been difficult. No figure skaters have
turned to mafia hitmen — they’re all
busy working on triple toe—loops,
double sow-cows and Walt Disney
World endorsement deals. ‘

American skiers have yet to .4

crack mainstream media. The
Jamaican bobsled team has kept a
low profile. Most U.S. fans still

-think that “curling” applies to hair

care instead of a very complicated
sport involving brooms, large ovular
objects with handles, and lots and
lots and lots of sweeping.

The lone attempt at forging a sto-
ryline comes from the National
Hockey League, which decided to
allow its players to compete in the
Nagano games. For the first time,
professional hockey players will rep-
resent their countries in a battle for
world ice superiority.

Staff Writer

The West Virginia
Mountaineers picked up last
night where they left off last
Wednesday, jumping to a 15-2
lead to start yesterday’s basket-
ball contest with Pitt.

However, the young Pitt
team, who was playing in front
of a very hostile Morgantown
crowd, settled down and battled
back.

Then the Mountaineers
went on a 14-2 run late in the
first half to take a 41-27 lead.

- Pitt battled back again, this
time within ﬁve points.

But every time Pitt fought
back, the West Virginia defense
clamped ' down, _ and the
Panthers were hit with yet
another injury, this time to
Ricardo Greer. Then,’ the
young, depleted Panther squad
began to run out of steam.

When the game was on the
line, West Virginia ﬂexed their
muscles and proved why they

are the 15th ranked team in the
land, defeating Pitt 90-72 last
night in Morgantown, W.Va.

‘‘I’m proud of our guys,
they did a great job of ﬁghting
out there tonight,” Pitt Head
Coach Ralph Willard said.

The Panthers were already
playing without sophomore
guard Kellii Taylor, when
Willard leamed that freshman
Stephen Flores collided with
Vonteego Cummings during a
pregame shoot around, result-
ing in stitches. for Cummings
and the loss of a tooth for
Flores. Then, when Greer left
the game with a contusion on
his left leg, it seemed like the
roof ‘of the West Virginia
Coliseum came tumbling down
on the Panthers. -

‘This is another day of r '
for us,” VV1llard said of the
injuries that have plagued his
squad. “But we’re not making
any excuses. That’s a pretty
damn good ‘basketball team
here. They’re tough at home

Early in the second half,Pitt~

Lady Panther guard Michelle
Katkowski went up for a
rebound against Georgetown
Hoya Sylita Thomas.

Both jumped. The 5-foot-6
Katkowski tipped the ball back
into the air.

They did it again. Jump, tip.

Jump, tip. Jump, tip.

On the fifth jump—tip, the 6-
foot-2 Thomas grabbed the ball
and shot a pass to teammate Kim
Gallon, who hit a wide-open
three-pointer.

An exercise in futility fol-

lowed by a Georgetown conver-'

sion — the series was a perfect
summary of Pitt’s 72-56 loss to
the Hoyas last night. -
“Things just didn’t fall int
place,” Katkowski said. The
guard had five points on the
night, and about an equal num-

ber of falls to the Fitzgerald
Field House ﬂoor. And she was-
n’t alone.

The violence began early in '
the contest, when Pitt freshman
Kenosha Chastang scored a
block on Georgetown’s Kacy
Williams. Chastang blocked the
ball cleanly with one hand, and
when Williams’ momentum car-
ried her into _the Pitt forward,
Chastang swatted her away with
the other. Both Williams and the
ball landed out of bounds, and
Pitt took possession over the
screams of Hoya Coach Patrick
Knapp.

Only moments later, though,
Georgetown got its revenge. An
8-0 run put the Hoyas up 22-13
before Monique Toney sank a
layup to stop the bleeding. The
Hoyas would ﬂirt with a double-
digit lead for the rest of the con-
test.

Pitt swimming takes four firsts against tough Harvard team  

Jay Yander
Staff Writer

Some say moral victories don’t mean
much.

But in this weekend’s case, the Pitt
men’s swimming and diving team chalked
up a win. For morality’s sake.

The team knew this weekend’s meet
against nationally ranked Harvard wasn’t
going to be easy, but after the dust settled
in Boston, the Panthers came away with
six individual victories. Pitt lost the overall
meet, though, 172-122.

“I said last week if we could win four
races, I’d be very happy with that eﬁort,”
said Pitt Head Coach Chuck Knoles. “But
with six victories this weekend, we’re very

pleased with the guys.”

The biggest Pitt accomplishment of
the weekend was the ﬁrst-place ﬁnish in
the opening event of the meet. Pitt swam to
victory in the 200-yard medley relay,
despite Harvard being ranked ﬁfth nation-
ally in the event. '

Eric Stefanski, Jon Haggerty, Devin
Meece and Jerry Koller led the Panthers to
the relay win even though they missed the
pre-meet warm-ups thanks to travel haz-
ards — the team van had two ﬂat tires, then
carried the squad on an unexpected detour
through the Boston suburbs.

“We had a couple of SNAFU S on the
way to the meet,” Knoles said. “I’m glad
missing the warm—up didn’t affect us nega-
tively.”

Haggerty led Pitt with three victories
on Saturday in the 100-yard butterﬂy, the
200-yard butterﬂy, and as a member of the
200-yard medley relay team.

Pitt’s second biggest contributor on
the weekend was Meece, a freshman with
victories in the 100-yard breaststroke and
as a member of the 200-yard medley relay
team. Meece also placed second in the
200-yard breaststroke.

Rounding out the victories for the
Panthers were Brian Elko in the 100—yard
backstroke and George Anderson in the
tl1ree—meter dive. Elko also came through‘
with two. second-place ﬁnishes in the 200-
yard backstroke and the 100-yard butterﬂy.

am with their effort,” Knoles said. “They

‘ Meece is currently ranked in the
national top 10 in each of his main events
— the 100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke.

“[Meece] being only a ﬁeshman is
what makes this so impressive,” Knoles
said. “He’s the only freshman in Pitt athlet-
ics ranked in the top 10 nationally in
his/her respective sport.”

and they just feed off of the crowd.”

Not to say that Pitt didn’t have a
chance. The Panthers didn’t help their
own cause, committing 16 turnovers that
resulted in 32 West Virginia points.

“They make you pay when you turn
the ball over,” Willard said. A

West Virginia wasted little time
before jumping on the Panthers to begin
the game. Senior guard Jarrod West,
who ﬁnished with 18 points, keyed the
15-2 run with two three pointers.

But Pitt answered with a 16-6 run of
their own, in which sophomore guard
Jarrett Lockhart and Flores each hit a
triple to pull Pitt within three points.

_ However, WVU, who has won their
ﬁfth straight and has inched within one
game of Connecticut for first place in
the Big East, gave Pitt different defen-
sive looks. The defenses often confused

Twice during their 14-2 run late in the
first half, senior sensation Damian
Owens, who ﬁnished with 16 points,

stole ill-advised passes and converted

them into lay‘-ups at the other end of the
court. v.
This is the first time since the 1980-

consecutive games to the Mountaineers.

The Mountaineers, who now are 19-
3 overall and 9-3 in Big East play, also
held Cummings, Pitt’s top scorer, to

only six points. Wherever he was, there V

were at least two Mountaineers.
Cummings was frustrated at times and
seemed to force shots or passes, often
resulting _in a turnover. But to
Cummings’ credit, he was injured prior
to the game. '

Despite the injuries, things weren’t
all bad for_Pitt. Lockhart finished with

22 points, tying his career high, with 14

Attila Cosby, who played a strong game,
