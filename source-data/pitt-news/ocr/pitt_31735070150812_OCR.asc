WPTS makes the ﬁnal cut in contest

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

For the second year in a row, Pitt
radio station WPTS-FM earned a
spot as a ﬁnalist for the mtvU'Col-_
lege Radio Woodie Award.

The award’s sponsor, mtvU,
chose the top 25 stations in the
country — one of which was Pitt

"— based on information gathered .
4 from acknowledgements given by -

music publishing company CM],
thevPrinceton Review, reviews of
the stations from various publica-
tions and Twitter hashtags. These

25 stations were then whittled .,

down to 10 ﬁnalists through an

online vote. A

Among the nine other ﬁnal-
ist stations for the College Radio
Woodie are Ohio University’s
ACRN, University ofAlaska Fair-
banks’ KSUAiand University of
California Berkeley’s KALX.

According to WPTS Djjohn La-
vanga, the station’s success in the
Woodievoting can be attributed to
its dedicated fanbase.

“We have to give people a rea-
son to want to vote for us,” La-
vanga said. “It’s abouticreating

consistent and quality program- .

ming.”

WPTS engineering director,

Kyle Schoenstein connects the

station’s success in recent Woodie
contests to WPTS’ dedicated staff.

-“It’s a testament to the quality
of the radio station that we can at-
tract campus talent that can keep
WPTS in the top 25 for many years
running,” he said.

Last year, Appalachian State _

University’s station, WASU-FM-,
beat Pitt for the Woodie.

' Students can continue to vote
for WPTS in the contest through
Thursday, March 14, at 4 p.m. The

Pitt battles with low
OM ET response rates

, Matt Schaff &
Elizabeth Furiga
The Pitt News Stcﬁ”

As the University continues on the
endless drive toward perfecting its

teaching quality, it may lose the in- ‘

put of thousands of students. The
/ effects of that loss, however, remain
uncertain.

In the fall of 2013, Pitt w_ill per- ‘

manently discard paper as the stan-
dard—bearer of student evaluations

of teaching and commit to a new .

online system, even though about
.30 percent fewer students complete
the online surveys. This academic
year (2012-2013) will be the ﬁrst
and last in which all instructors
can request either -paper or online
surveys, administered by the Office
of Measurement and Evaluation of
Teaching. A
While -OMET typically reports 75
_percent average response rates for
paper surveys, last fall just under
half of undergraduates in classes
that offered online surveys ﬁlled
them out, according to a recent
OMET report. -
Given that the results of the

anonymous OMET surveys guide‘

- instructors in improving their
courses and inﬂuence promotion
decisions within departments, the
large drop in response rates has
elicited concern from faculty across
Pitt.

“In all departments, it counts,”
Juan Manfredi, vice provost of un-
dergraduate studies, said of the
OMET surveys. “Students have to
understand that this is very impor-
tant. This is part of their contri-
bution to the improvement of the
educational experience.” '

- The lead—up to online OMETs

Manfredi currently heads the
provost’s Advisory Council on In-
structional Excellence, to which
Provost Patricia Beeson assigned
in 2010 the task of exploring a pos-
sible University—wide.adoption of
online “OMETS.” Not only would
these online surveys allow Pitt to
keep up with other leading univer-
sities, the ACIE ﬁgured, but they
‘would also lead to greater efﬁciency.

- “Youdon’t lose class time, be-
cause it has to be outside of class,”
Manfredi said of the online surveys,
which OMET student-employees
have traditionally distributed and
proctored during class time. “We
go green, so that we don’t have
to use paper.. It’s, in theory, more
convenient for everybody, and it’s
easier for us to learn and modify
the system so we can design it to
do what we want it to do.”

Despite these gains —‘—— which,
based on numbers from OMET Di-
rector Nancy Reilly, include saving
some money and potentially half a
million pieces of paper per year— a
move toward “on—your-own-time”
online evaluations implies lower
response rates and the risk that the
survey results could change.

“That’s not what we found,”
Reilly said of the latter risk, refer-
ring to a pilot study the ACIE con-
ducted during last academic year
(2011-2012) with the help of Reilly
and the leadership of Pitt psychol-

' ogy professor Christian Schunn.
’ The study, which reached-

across schools to compare classes
that administered either paper or
online surveys to students, found
no statistically, signiﬁcant differ-
ences between average ratings or

between the distributions of ratings along
a one-through-ﬁve scale (the prototypical
OMET question: “Express your judgment of
the instructor’s overall teaching effective-
ness” .

But the online platform may slightly skew
the results toward the ones and ﬁves, Reilly
said. “We found, as with other institutions,

that there does tend to be higher negative ‘‘

and higher positive responses.”

Faculty concerns

The results of the pilot study, available
on the OMET website, speak to the most
common concern the faculty have had about
the online system — thatlower numbers of
students ﬁlling out OMETs could compromise
the surveys’ meaning. ‘

If his department were to see a similar

drop in response rates, “Obviously, statisti-

cally, we’d be -much less conﬁdent with the
results,” said Daniel Mossé, chair of the De-
partment of Computer Science. -

With smaller samples of students,‘aver-
age ratings become more variableand sus-_
ceptible to inﬂuence by extraneous factors.

“As the response rate goes down, you have
to wonder about-some kind of bias that has
been built in there,” Anette DeVito Dabbs,
chair of the Department of Acute and Tertiary
Care in the School of Nursing, said. ,

Joan Rogers, chair of the Department of
Occupational Therapy in the School of Health
and Rehabilitation Sciences, speculates that
students’ emotions could produce such bias.
When response rates fall, as they did in her
department from about 90 percent to 60
percent, she said, “you don’t know if it’s the
students that have abeef to spare, so to speak,
that are ﬁlling them out. You lose the total
signiﬁcance of the indicator you use.”

But it’s not just the numbers that faculty
care about.

Edward Stricker, professor of neurosci-
ence and dean of the University Honors Col-
lege, bemoaned the reduction in written
comments he found when evaluations for
his course, Introduction to Neuroscience,
moved online in the fall of 2012.

“I didn’t get as much feedback as I usually
get, and a valuable part of the feedback was
missing,” Stricker said.

b He has certainly seen a fair drop in the
response level of feedback -—— particularly
qualitative evaluations of his performance
as an instructor. According to Stricker, in
previous years, 80-85 percent of Stricker’s
students ﬁlled out the paper survey, but in
fall 2012, only 50-55 percent ﬁlled out the
online survey. ' " '

As of press time, the OMET oﬂice was
unable to determine whether the average
proportion of students that writes in the
free-response section changes between paper
and online surveys. _

While admiring the eﬂiciency of online

surveys,le;cturer and undergraduate adviser _
Michael Kessler of the Department of Phi-

losophy thinks the online system sacriﬁces

surveys — the environment.
“Being in the safne room allows you to vi-

_ sualize what things were like in the course of

that semester,” Kessler said. “There’s some-
thing about being in the .room that connects
what you’re writing down to what your ex-
periences were in the class.” I

Importance of OMET
The fact that the switch to online surveys

. means so much to faculty reﬂects the criti-

cal roles that OMETS play at the University.

First and foremost, OMET results,mat—
ter most to individual instructors. Armed
with hard data on student perceptions of,
their classes after each term, instructors
everywhere modify their teaching methods
accordingly. . ‘

“I rely on the OMETs to tell me whether
I’m doing a good job, whether I’m earning
my pay,” history professor Janelle Green-
berg said. i

The OMETs allow Greenbergtosgauge
student reactions to a variety of general
measures of interest, such as whether she
appears “disorganized” in class. They also
provide her more speciﬁc information on
which to act directly.

. “I recently changed a major textbook in
one of my classes because in several semes-
ters running, I’ve heard from students in
the OMETs that the textbook is too dense

' and not in the least helpful,” she “said. “Had

I not had the OMETS, I would not have had

that information.”
Stricker has’ paid special attention to writ- .

ten comments for the improvement of his
curriculum and classroom technique.
“There have been several‘t~imes'in which
students have said something that I was very”
glad to know that I didn’t know,” Stricker said
on the importance of student comments. “If

one student says something as very interest- ~

ing and relevant, then I’ll pay attention" to it.”

In addition to helping instructors opti-
mize classroom technique, the OMET surveys
help decide which Pitt instructors get hired
or promoted. V

The Pitt News talked to 10 department
adfninistratorsvin four schools (Arts and Sci-
ences, Nursing, Engineering and Health and
Rehabilitation Science), and they all said that
OMET evaluations factor into staffing and
promotion decisions. They all require some

my.

kind of teaching evaluation, and OMETs mak

' up the lion’s share. . »

“Ifsomeone is not doing a good job in
the classroom, it’s not easy for them to get
promoted,” said Reid Andrews, the chair of
the Department of History.

A trend of low OMET ratings for an in-

structor would similarly worry William’

Stanchina, chair of the Department of Electri-
cal and Computer Engineering.' “That could
be a showstopper for that person,” he said.
On the other hand, if “you can see growth
and improvement over the course of several
years, that’s a good sign, because it shows
that the person is working hard to improve
their teaching.” .

The impact of OMETs on instructors’
employmentostatus depends on the type of
instructor. For faculty not eligible for ten-
ure 4 a special assurance of job security
and academic freedom — such as lecturers,
OMETs mean one thing;'for “tenure-stream”
faculty, it means another.

' Lecturers typically work at Pitt in short-
term appointments that departments can
choose whether or not to renew.

Thus, the teaching evaluations are “much
more of a conversation'with non—tenure—
stream faculty,_because that is their primary
responsibility, teaching,” said Mossé.

In occupational therapy, there’s a cut-and-
dry relationship between OMET scores and
the employment of lecturers. “If they’re not
successﬁil, we just don’t ask them to come
bac ,” Rogers said. . -

By‘ contrast, employment decisions re-
garding tenure—stream faculty focus on multi-
ple measures, namely teaching and research.

“This is a research institution,” said An-

’ drews. For tenure-stream-faculty, “research

ranks somewhathigher,” he said. _
Nonetheless, the OMETs are “highly
relevant for the assistant professors,” said
Andrews. ‘ - « I
That’s because the promotion from as-
sistant to associate professor is a big deal
for two reasons: Pitt will only grant tenure
to associate or-full professors, and faculty
can stay no longer than seven years in the
tenure stream before being “terminated”
from the tenure stream, according to the
P-itt Faculty Handbook. C - _
The OMETS help validate engineering
course quality an additional way —-— outside

accreditation.

“All engineering programs are accred-
ited by ABET,” said Stanchina, referring to
the formerly titled Accreditation Board for
Engineering and Technology, which reviews
engineering programs worldwide.

Engineering departments undergo ABET
re-accreditation every six years.

Accordingly, “We of course maintain
records of all these [OMET] evaluations,
because those are part of the materials we
have available for re-accreditations,” said
Harvey Borovetz, chair of the Department of
Bioengineering. “The focus is on continuous

' improvement on our educational programs.”

But again, said Borovetz, a lower OMET
response rate “means that we, as educators,
have less information from our students in
terms of the strengths and weaknesses in the
classes we teach.”

Finding a solution.

As the spring 2013 evaluation period ap-
proaches, instructors and administrators
acrossthe University are eagerly lopking for
ways to boost the online OMET response rate.

“Some ‘ticklers’ I think need to be put into
the system for the faculty, as well as forthe
students,” said Do_n"Bialostosky, chair of the
English department. - -

Manfredi thinks these “ticklers” could
come in the form of gentle encouragement.

“For example, maybe sending emails at
a certain time, asking faculty members to
remind the students, assuring students that

3 this is really important,” he said. '
The University could also look to other »

colleges for ideas as to how to encourage
students to ﬁll out online surveys. The Uni-
versity of Chicago provides one model for
potential imitation.

Several years. ago, UChicago implemented
an online evaluation system that allows stu-
dents to see grades earlier in the grading
period if they have put in their online evalu-
ations. But the University of Chicago does
not withhold grades, and all studentsreceive
their grades at the end of the term.

Alternatively, departments at Pitt could
develop their own surveys and control how
they’re distributed.

Mossé said the computer science depart-
ment does so already. '

“We conduct surveys among students -
it’s not a survey, it’s actually a quiz —- to as-
sess whether students are retaining material
or not,” Mossé, who thinks OMETs don’t offer

I complete information, said.
David Waldeck, Chemistry Department '

chair, thinks Pitt could ﬁirther encourage stu-
dent responses by making the survey results
public. Other universities such as Carnegie
Mellon already publish the results of their
teaching surveys. 

“The ‘University could do a ‘Rate Your »

Professor’ a lot better than some outside
unit,” Waldeck said, comparing the potential
effectiveness of published OMETs to that of
Ratemyprofessors.com, the outside rating
website that often helps students choose
courses. “If I wanted to" increase it [the re-
sponse rate], I’d know how. I would do it
University-wide .—‘I’d let people see it,” he
said. I

Resist the internet-ﬁxated society that
S supports ‘Harlem Shake’ videos

Pitt Menis Glee Club performing in a“l-Iarlem Shake" video.YouTube

John Hasley
Columnist

Thinking about making or par-
ticipating in a “Harlem Shake”
video? Wow! Tell me, what other‘
totally cutting-edge and com-
pletely original thoughts or
ideas have you had lately? Have
you invented some kind of elec-
tronic word-processing device?
Or discovered some unique way
of telling time based on the ori-
entation of the earth to" the sun?

Though it grieves me to be the
bearer of what I’m sure will come
as bad news, counting in Inter-
net years, you are at this‘ point a
few millennia too late to be even
close on time with this. Rather,
should you proceed to produce
this video, it will more likely to
become a fuzzy little recrudes-
cence on the hind-quarters of
the big, fat, sweaty mammoth

of an Internet fad that was the A

“Harlem Shake” videos than to
be part of its zenith.

Memo to those who have al-
ready made or participated in a
“Harlem Shake” video: You are
complicit in one of the most
loathsome and spiritually sap-
ping endeavors since the dawn
of advertising or the invention of
penicillin. If we lived in a society
that still embraced such admira-

ble correction institutions such
as the stocks, I would nominate
you on the first ballot.

-Okay, that was a joke, and
perhaps I’ve been a little harsh.
It’s certainly understandable to
take your cues based on the be-
havior of crowds. These types
of imprinting reactions are en-

coded into our minds and have Q
been for generations. I should at
least present my reasons for lev-
eling so harsh a criticism. What’s
at stake here is both a linguistic
worry and a behavioral one. By
my lights, the linguistic worry,
though it may strike some as un-
palatable, dissolves given even
the most cursory understand-
ing of how languageswork. The

behavioral one has much more
legitimacy.

While it should be obvious
that there is not fundamental
correspondence betweenwords
and the reality they seek to de-
scribe and communicate, this
does not preclude societies of

.speakers from contriving that

very relationship into agreed-
upon ways of referring to the
world. This, in its objectively
reproducible form, has been
going on ever since the birth
of market economies and de-
veloped. in conjunction with
the various complexities of any
given society. '

As speakers in such a society,
we, today, find ourselves vested
with a certain power and, thus,
confronted with an important
decision: How shall we ‘choose
to progress, or regress, the state
of our languages?.Are decision-
making schemas such as this
even an appropriate theater
in which to speak of regress?

sorts of directions for all sorts ofreasons,
but any attempt to chart a coherent tra-
jectory based on a set of applied values
illuminates more the values of the applier
than those ofthe society. Behavior, while
value-laden, shares little if any ontologi-
cal signiﬁcance with language. So, while
in a few generations we might be barking
like dogs and calling it Shakespeare, we’ll
certainly be able to understand a lot more
about the grammar and syntax of barking
like dogs than we do now.
I So why is calling this new edition of
the “Harlem Shake” (scare quotes might
be impertinent at this point) such a ter-
rible thing? Well, it isn’t, if you agree with
the cursory and vastly inaccurate — but
for the purposes ofthe discussion, none-
theless useful —. conception of language
evolution that I have just laid out. The
problem is more one of behavior than
lexical purity.

argument for the priority .of existence

mode of behavior, you are showing about
as much mental decision—making capabil-

the 18605. For the edification ofthe non-
historically inclined: That ain’t much.
The_“Harlem Shake” video phenom-

’ enon, far fro.m existing in a vacuum, is
little more than a symptom of the Inter-

~net—fixated society in which we live. Our
compulsion to edify ourselves online tells
us that while we might like to think the
Internet is a portal through which we
can reach new frontiers of knowledge,
understanding and community, it also
has the slightly less sanguine effect of
more vigilantly imposing group norms

he seemed to make the case for viewing im-

Anthony Wallace, author of “The Old

Priest,” has a complicated relationship '

with the Catholic Church.

“I really like the part [in the book]
where the priest thinks he changed into
a goat after taking.mushrooms,” he said.

Although Wallace trudged through
years of grammar school under the cold
glower of nuns,he also had a much more
constructive experience at a_]esuit—run
high school. These are two aspects of
his religious education that have —a place
in the book.  J 1

_ “N_othing better could have happened
for me and my writing,” 'he..said.
Wallace was selected from a pool of
more than 350 entries. When he first
heard the news, it took a moment to reg’-
ister with him. . V '
“I .played the answering machine when
1- got homefrom work,” he said of the life-
changing moment. “I just sort of stood
there and then started screaming.”
- Amy Hempel, an award-winning au-
thor who chose Wallace’s entry for the
award, praised “The Old Priest” as “a

V powjerhouse that has the scale and scope‘ -

of a novel.” And even though the charac-
ters are fictitious (‘Wallace said the priest

Yiscabased on an influentialjesuit he met in

hisischooling) they ring with humanity
andggrealness. .

flempel said the characters are “peo—
ple §«Iho appreciate simple pleasure while

unsavorybehavior, there is amoral core

in many of these people’s lives.”

The manuscript, as works of fiction
tend to do, evolved into something much

' more potent than originally intended

after years of being rejected for publi-
cation. 4

“The story, itself, started as a.portrait
of somebody I knew. But then it grew
into something else, something more
complicated,” Wallace said. .

Despite this complication, his stories
encompass a particular set of themes.

o “The stories in ‘The Old Priest’ have
to do with time and memory, and I think
there is a pattern in which they open out
beyond ordinary daily _time into some-
thing larger 4- the present moment
perhaps, but a larger conception of it,”
Wallace explained.

Wallace said it’s largely about coping -

and moving on, something the narrator of
“The Old Priest” tries to do painstakingly.
Andelike so many people, the narrator is
conﬂicted with religion and the weighty
ideals religion bears.

‘“The Old Priest’ talks about eternity,

as a place that contains everything that
has ever been — every lost dog, every
broken_ watch and every burnt dinner,”
Wallace said. I "

1968  

“It was a very painful year for me,”
Hartman said. “I remember just sobbing
as I’ would be nursing Sarah [her newborn
child] and thinking to myself  whatkind
of world was she going to grow up in? So it
was [powerful on] a sort of very personal,
gut level as well as this cosmic, world level.
It was very powerful, and'the exhibit picks

' it -upperfectly.” V

During 1968, at age 25, Hartman was not
just at home, crying with a child cradled in
her arms; she was also “involved in a lot of
anti—war discussions.”

 “Although many people I knew were tak-
 an active role in anti—war demonstra-
tibns, I believed these fed into the polariza-
tixjn  resolution of differences [became]

inﬁreasingly [handled] by vio1ence,rather -'

than by civil means,” Hartman said.

In February, Hartman traveled to Pitts-

burgh from her hometown in Minneapolis,
Minn. — a city that served as the McCarthy-
Humphrey battleground in 1968 —' to both

I

visit her daughter, Sarah, and see the exhibi- 77;

tion. Though her hometown was a previous

site for the traveling exhibit, she missed its V

stay because she was visiting Vietnam on a
sort of “personal atonement to represent
the?*5U.S. for the war” —— a war to which she
was always opposed. . —
But the demographic of visitors has not
merely been a ﬂock ofbaby-boomers.
“Younger people are kind of fascinated
with the ’6os, so their reaction isjust amazed
at all the things that happened that year,”
Ruby said. ’ .

Ned Schano, director of communications

at the Heinz History Center, also spoke to
this certain intriguing quality that the era

embodies. gv
.“There’s also a sort of mysticism about 
the year ...'Did all those things, really hap-

pen in one year? Is that reality? I mean the

ity?” he asked. . -
Schano ﬁnds most intriguing the idea
of the “living—room war,” or the way media

coverage of the Vietnam War changed the

national consciousness. .

“This wasn’t something just in history
books, so to speak, but [something] from a
media perspective. The news was there to
cover it all. You couldn’t hide from it—— that
was real life, daily life,”»he said.

The exhibit embodies an inescapability

that resonates as similarly as the year 1968
itself: with powerful audio recordings — a
sort of “voices” project .— projected inside
the massive “Huey” helicopter display, visi-
tors cannot hide from the stark reality that

was the year 1968. Furthermore, Martin .

Luther King’s “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop”
speech plays with passionate signiﬁcance
as, looking back, the speech appears to be
an_ eerie foreboding to his death.

To balance out the political and human
turmoil that “rocked” the year, there are also

some “lighter” artifacts, as Hartman put it,"

from the ’60s culture and counterculture that
serve as sweet relief from some of the deeply
entrenched emotional displays.

"A certain vibrancy pulses throughout

the exhibition —"the psychedelic fervor of
playing ’60s music trivia, creating your own

4 digital album cover, or seeing Mister Rog-

ers’ original set orjanis joplin’s real onstage
wardrobe, complete withpants’ andboa. .
While we may explore the year as part

. of a distinct era of the past, both Ruby and V
Hartman spoke to therelevancy that this 4

exhibition has for the present.

.“There is a lot of relevancy from 1968
to today. [For example,] . just the divisions,
politically. There was a major gun—control act

passed in 1968. It’s funny when you watch '

the MLK video, Bobby Kennedy’s talking
about gun violence. When’s it going to end?
Which is very timely with what’s going on
with the gun debate in America right now,”
Ruby said. ' ' °
_ Like Ruby, Hartman points to some of
the'hard questions that this year spawned,
similar to those that arose in 1968. ‘
“Where do we want our country to go?
What do we believe in? Do we believe in war?

Some of the questions that I think we’re still .

exploring as a country,” Hartman said. “I
think our attention to themrhas sort of ebbed

and ﬂowed, but in 1968, all- of these issues’,

were really in the forefront.”

WRESTUNG

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Writer

Friday’s dual match between No. 17 Pitts-
burgh wrestling team and No. 15 Edinboro
couldhave gone worse for Pitt through the
ﬁrst four matches, but not by much.

The Panthers fell behind 18-0 after the
ﬁrst four weight classes before managing
to rattle off six straight wins ‘capped by
an overtime decision to secure the 19-18
victory over the Fighting Scots.

“I think it shows the amount of heart

this team has that we were able to come '

back and beat a team like Edinboro,” junior
P.J. Tasser said. “Our team is ﬁlled with

guys who‘are going to go out on the mat i

and give 100 percent, win or lose.”

Pitt hasn’t won at the 125-pound weight
class in a dual match all season. That trend
didn’t change Friday, as Derrick Nelson
was pinned in the ﬁrst period at 1:32 by
Kory Mines. ‘

In the 133-pound weight class, No. 17
Shelton Mack of Pitt and No. 3 A.]. Schopp
of Edinboro know each other well. The two
have now met four times, with Schopp tak-
ing three of those matchups, including his
2-0 decision over Mack on Friday. Mack
wasn’t happy with the result, even though
he wrestled close with the third-ranked

‘wrestler.

“It’s frustrating to wrestle a match
where I’m not able to get my offense go-
ing,” he said. “But that is something that is
going to come wrestling top-ranked guys.”

Travis Shaffer, who returned in the
Edinboro match after missing the Lehigh
match because of a torn meniscus, was
pinned with six seconds remaining in the
match by No. 5 Mitchell Port; ‘ ‘

V While it looked like Shaffer was goingto _,
be able to steal a victory after picking up

three ‘near-fall points in the second period
to take a 3-2 lead into the third period, Port
was able to reverse him and pulled through
with a last-second pin. Shaffer’s loss gave
Edinboro six team points. ' 1 -

Pitt’s last loss of the night came when
Edinboro’s No. 17 David Habat won by deci-
sion over Ronnie Garbinsky, 8-6. n

Then, the comeback started.

Senior Donnie Tassergot the Panthers
on the scoreboard at 157 pounds in his last
regular-seasonmatch. Tasser’s 10-2 major
decision gave Pitt its only team bonus point
of the night — the point it needed to squeak
the victory out. —

No. 17 Tyler Wilps continued to build
momentum for Pitt with a 9-6 decision at
165 pounds; His third-period single-leg
takedown gave him the match lead.

Nick Bonaccorsi had a two-takedown
ﬁrst period, which propelled him to a 6-1

decision victory over his Edinboro oppo-
nent. With three matches to go, Pitt trailed
by eight points, 18-10.

At 184 pounds, No. 14 Max Thomus-
seit looked shaky at ﬁrst, surrendering a
takedown to Vince-Pickett. Those would be
Pickett’s only points, though, as Thomus-
seit quickly turned the matchup around
for a 7-2 decision. " f C

Pitt’s best wrestler usually trots out at
197 pounds, but ‘due to No.7 heavyweight
Zac Thomusseit’s 'il1ness, No. 3 Matt Wilps
was forced to bump up to heavyweight. -P.J.
Tasser was called upon to replace Wilps.

“I knew that if the dual score was close,
we were going to try some ‘sort of move-
ment around the lineup,” P._]. Tasser said.
“There was some pressured-wrestling’ 197,
but I was just very llexcitedgabout the op-

portunity and wanted to  my team any

way possible.” I A  F

That he did. Tasser,1whof_usually wres-

at the 285-pound weight class.-

“The coaches had warned me right be-
fore the match, but I didn’t know for certain
until right before the 197 bout,” Wilps said.

After wrestling to a 2-2 tie during reg-

'ulation, the wrestlers entered overtime.
Neither was able to get a pointin sudden‘
victory before the overtime periods. Wilps ,

began on top and was able to ridejames out
for 30 seconds, keeping him from scoring.

In his period down, Wilps quickly es-
caped for the eventual winning point. His
3-2 overtime victory earned Pitt the 19-18
triumph in its last-,ever.EWL dual match,
as the Panthers will wrestle in the Atlantic
Coast Conference next season.

Pitt returns to Edinboro in two weeks

wouaws BASKETBALL
No. 3 UConn

awaits Panthers
after close loss

Tyler Pecyna
S taff Writer

If the Pitt women’s basketball team ﬁnishes
winless in its ﬁnal three Big East games, it
will mark the second consecutive season in
which it did not record a single regular—season
conference victory.‘

"Connecticut, the Panthers’ opponent on
Tuesday at 7 p.m., had 51 conference streak of
its own not too long ago.The Huskies went

‘ ‘undefeated in the Big East for ﬁve straight

seasons, from 2006-2011, and are again in
the midst of yet another impressive campaign
under head coach Geno Auriemma.

- The Huskies (25-2, 12-1 Big East) host the
Panthers (‘9-17, 0-13 Big East) at the XL Center
for the ﬁrst time since]an..22, 2011 — a 66-
46 victory for the home team. Last season,
Pitt lost by 49 points against the eventual
Big East champs. This season’s matchup, on
paper, looks like it could yield a similar result.
' ‘ The conference’s second-ranked team, No.
3 Connecticut, is a defensive nightmare for op-
ponents. On average, the Huskies allow fewer
than 50 points per game- Only nine teams
have scored more than that many against
UConn so far, whereas Pitt has allowed 17
opponents to score more than _60 points this
season. '

Kelly Faris leads the stingy Huskies on
defense by averaging nearly three steals per
contest, making her the ﬁfth-best ball-thief
in the Big East. Faris is part of a team defense
that has limited opponents to just a .309 ﬁeld-
goal percentage this season. '

The UConn senior guard recorded her
1,00oth career point off a steal last Satur-
day — senior.night'for the Huskies — in a
90-30 romping of Seton Hall.

After the game, Seton Hall head coach
Anne Donovan said of Faris, ‘“I know she
prides herself on her defense and shutting
people down, and. she certainly battled. We
can see that she’s a kid that really loves that
challenge [of facing the opponents’ best
scorer .”

That challenge against Pitt could come in
the form of Asia Logan, who scored a team-
high.21 points in a 72-70 loss against George-
town on Saturday. She said afterward, “I’m
trying to be aggressive.”

The Panthers will have to be aggressive
against Faris and her teammates, who not
only keep opponents on their toes with quick
defensive hands, but are also no slouches on
offense. “ ‘

Growth of women’s UFC encouraging sign

Ronda Rousey was a two-time Olympian

in judo. MCT Campus

Isaac Saul .
, ‘ Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Women’s athletics stepped into a new realm
on Saturday night during a short event that
has the potential to leave an indelible imp act
on sports fans. ’ _

_ After pummeling and getting pummeled
for nearly ﬁve minutes, Ronda Rousey won
the ﬁrst-ever women’s UFC\match over Liz
Carmouche with just 11 seconds to go in the
opening round.

This match was the headliner for the UFC

157' pay-per-View event in Anaheim, Calif.,'

and it made 2011, when UFC President Dana
White said a women’s ﬁght would never hap-

‘ pen, seem like a distant memory.

Carmouche and Rousey proved women’s

' UFC can provide the same excitement as any

other divisionin the organization.

Rousey '— who found herself in trouble
early-when Carmouche caught her in a rear
naked chokehom —— ended the ﬁght with an
armbar, her signature move. While ‘she was
evading the rear naked chokehold, Rousey
nearly lost her mouthpiece and her top all

at 0I'lCQ.

“I was more concerned with my sports‘ bra
staying on while she was choking me because
I felt safe and in control,” Rousey told Fuel
TV during the post-ﬁght show. “She squeezed

across my face and‘ my mouth, and she almost .
‘ forced my mouth guard out.”

While losing your bra may not be some-
thing men’s UFC ﬁghters have to worry about,’

that was basically the only difference you ‘

would’ve noticed during the ﬁght. The two
battled with just as much skill, speed and

' ferocity as you would expect in any other

mixed martial arts match.

Interestingly, that literal ﬁght may be one
of the ﬁnal chapters in the metaphorical one
for equal opportunity for men and women
in athletics. _ ,

Since the passing of Title IX in 1972 —’

-which declared “no person in the United

States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded
from participation in, be denied the beneﬁts
of or be subjected to discrimination under

any education program or activity receiving ‘

federal ﬁnancial assistance” —_-the gender
imbalance of sports and the movement to
erase it has been on the national stage. A
Now, it may be time for people to start
focusing on the marketing and growth of
these women’s sports,‘rather than simply
the existence of them. _ '
When thinking of dominant female

athletes, most people probably conjure up a

images of Mia Hamm or Serena and Venus
Williams. "
With tennis, soccer, basketball and wom-

en’s‘ events at the X Games arguably the most --

visible of all collegiate and professional wom-
en’s sports, we’re.left to wonder: Why these
sports? And what will be next?-

— For me, as an enthusiastic American
sports fan, I can see the appeal of each of
these visible women’s sports.

Tennis brought us the strength and domi-
nance of the aforementioned Williams sisters.
What else sparks a fanatic following more
than a dominant athletic family?

Soccer gave us the heroics of Mia Hamm

and the iconic shirtless celebration of Brandi

Chastain. . ,

The development of women’s basketball
has produced some of the most skilled play-
ers in the country — male or female -.— and
programs such as University of Conne<':ticut’s,
which has won seven national championships
since 1995. '

. Finally, the X Games have brought us ath-
letes such as Sarah Burke —— who has the most
Superpipe gold medals of any male or female
athlete — and Kelly Clark, who became the
ﬁrst female athlete to land a 1080 in Super-
pipe competition.

What I see from all these women is some-
thing encouraging: No longer are standards
being set based on appearance and modeling
experience. Finally —- it seems — the most
visible women in sports are actually the ones
who are the most dominant.

Even Danica Patrick, NASCAR’s ﬁrst fe- -
. male driver to win a NASCAR Sprint Series

pole position, was talked about lastrweek
more for her eighth—place ﬁnish at the Day-
tona 500 than for her gender. ‘

So as the tides continue to shift, we may
have seen the birth of a new star Saturday
night. Rousey —- who is an Olympic bronze
medalist injudo — has all the qualities‘ of a
star: a dominant record (she ﬁnished all six
of her professional and amateur bouts in the
ﬁrst round), a ﬁnishing -move (all of those
matches ended via armbar submission) and
now a title belt around her waist.

Look for that title defense to draw a grow-

. ing number of spectators, and keep your eyes
open for someone who is sure to be a house-
hold name in the near future. I

FOOTBALL

Football
schedule out

Jasper Wilson
Assistant Sports Editor

A Labor Day get together with defending ACC
‘champion Florida State will kick. off Pitt’s

2013 football season, University officials an— .

nounced on Monday. _ _

The Sept. 2 contest will begin the school’s
ﬁrst season as a member of the Atlantic Coast
Conference. In a formal press conference at
Heinz Field, athletic director Steve Pederson
and head coach Paul Chryst spoke on the ﬁ-
nalization of the schedule.

“To start and end our inaugural ACC season
at Heinz Field with two of the most storied

. brands in college football is spectacular,” Ped-
erson said. “Every game in this league, home
and away, will provide our fans with a lot- of
excitement and anticipation.”

The Panthers will close the regular season
by welcoming traditional juggernaut Univer-
sity of Miami} ,

Chryst echoed the sentiment about the
league’s depth but also-spoke about ‘the ex-
citement of beginning the year with such a
marquee game. , .

“Each and every week will present us with
a signiﬁcant challenge and opportunity,’_’ he
said. “And season openers don’t get any big-
ger than facing the defending ACC champion,
Florida State, on national television.”

_ The ACC opponents had been known
since-last month, but today cemented the
dates of the teams’ meetings. University of
Virginia and University of North Carolina
will also travel to Pittsburgh, while a home
game -against Notre Dame will highlight the
nonconference matchups.

University officials also announced that
this year’s nonconference Football Champi-
onship Subdivision opponent had switched.
Pitt armounced that Villanova would come to
Heinz Field, butfuture Football‘Bowl Subdivi-

sion member Old Dominion University will

i make thetrip, instead. I

Connecticut leads the Big East — and is .

near the top nationally —— in essentially ev-
ery key offensive statistic: points per game,
ﬁeld—goal percentage, 3-point percentage
and assist-to—turnover ratio.

Sophomore forward Kaleena Mosqueda-
Lewis is the key weapon behind the laundry
list of statistics and accolades that make UCo-
nn the unstoppable force it is with the ball.

Mosqueda—Lewis is second in the Big East
in scoring at 17 points per game, makes 3.1
3—pointers per contest and is shooting a re-
markable 50 percent from beyond the arc. .

Though just a sophomore, Mosqueda-
Lewis also scored her 1,000th career point
in UConn’s last game against Seton Hall.

The Huskies are hot, and they’re thriv-
ing off milestone achievements and senior
recognition. _ -

Conversely, the Panthers are fresh off a
frustrating last-second loss to Georgetown
—_ a microcosm of the disappointing season.

‘ “You know, the things that happen to you

sometimes, you can’t orchestrate, you can’t

"‘ predict,” Auriemma said after’Faris scored

pher 1,oo_oth career point. “If you just keep do-
ing a lot of good things and keep working hard
 keep putting yourself in the best position

" possible, then good things happen to you.”

If Pitt applies that attitude as it nears the

end of the Big East regular season, it can enter .

Storrs, Conn., and offer a ﬁghting chance to
end an ignominious stretch of play against a
team that built its name on dominating the

- conference. I
