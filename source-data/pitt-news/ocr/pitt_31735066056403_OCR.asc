Athletic department faces gender equity complaint

By Travis Senseny
Staff Writer

The Education Department’s
Office of Civil Rights is currently
investigating a Title IX coin-
plaint against the University of
Pittsburgh.

Title IX, which was enacted in
1972, is the federal law that out-
laws gender discrimination in
institutions that receive federal
funding.

Carol Sprague, the senior
associate athletic director, said

the university is unsure who
filed the complaint because the
Office of Civil Rights does not
release names of complainants.
However, she stressed that the
complaint was not filed by any
former or present athlete or
coach.

_ According to records, the_

unidentified complainant said
he/she is filing the complaint
“on behalf of intercollegiate ath-
letes and potential female ath-
letes at the University of
Pittsburgh.”

Some areas that are covered
under Title IX include admis-
sions, financial aid, housing and
athletics.

Sprague said, “If we would
have started 20 years ago when
the law passed, we would be
there.” 2

Sprague said the complaint
may have stemmed from an arti-
cle that appeared in USA Today
on June 8, 1992 or in The
Chronicle of Higher Education
on April 8, 1992. The articles
listed expenditures on scholar-

ships, operations and recruiting
as comparedto numbers of
female athletes and female stu-
dents at 201 Division I-A
schools. Sprague said, “There
were mistakes in the numbers
we reported.”

William Savage, director of
Affirmative Action at Pitt, said,
“It is my understanding that this
is not the only institution to
have a complaint based on the
information printed.”

Savage said that the complaint
was received by the university

on July 29, 1992.

The university was required
to answer a questionnaire,
which was returned to the
Office of Civil Rights in August
of 1992. Savage said in June of
1993 officials from the Office of
Civil Rights conducted a week-
long investigation at Pitt.

The investigation included
interviews with university offi-
cials and inspections of athletic
facilities. ,

Pannel prepares to shape up 11th floor

By Steve Kozarovich
News Assistant

A television, a VCR and a stairmaster
were mentioned as possible new addi-
tions to the 11th floor of Amos Hall at
Sunday night’s Panhellenic Association
meeting.

The new additions are part of a pro-
gram between Panhel and the Student
Government Board to convert the top
floor of Amos Hall into a combination
recreation and workout center. SGB

President Jacob Brody was present to
speak about the possible conversion.
Julie Holaren, external vice presi-
dent of Panhel, said the idea has been
discussed for a while but it is now
“definitely something in the works.”
According to Panhel President

Lorraine Shipley, the idea was pro-

posed by the graduate student assis-
tant to Panhel Kerry Daly. Shipley said
SGB will match Panhel funds up to a
certain number. After that the funds
will be provided solely by Panhel.

The meeting also held ceremonies to
induct 12 new junior Panhel delegates.
The new group of delegates, the
Pledge Executive Board, is made up of
one elected member from each sorori-
ty pledge class, according to Holaren.

“This is an opportunity to familiarize
[the pledges] with the workings of
Panhe1,” Shipley said. “Panhel can also
directly influence the pledge classes.”

Pitt develops
procedure to
identify likely
stroke victims

By Brian Lehew
Staff Writer

A procedure developed at Pitt to measure
cerebral blood flow can identify people with a
greater risk of stroke, allowing them to explore
better treatment options.

A recent study at Montefiore University
Hospital by Dr. Howard Yonas, developer of
the CBF measurement technique, suggests that
early detection of poor cerebral physiology --
blood flow to and from the brain — can benefit
patients by giving them new avenues of treat-
ment, ranging from artery bypass to a simple
reduction in their current medication.

“The benefit [of the technique] is that it lets us
see the need to get blood into an area [of the
brain] that is really hungry,” Yonas said.

The retrospective study, which appears in the
October issue of the _/ouma/ of /Veuroszngeij)»,

involved 68 people in two groups who showed.

stroke-like symptoms or had a non-disabling
stroke.

Their CBF was measured by a computerized
tomography scan while they inhaled xenon gas.
A duplicate scan was given 2() minutes later,
after the patients were intravenously injected
with acetazolamide —— a drug which dilates the
blood vessels.

The patients were placed in one of two
groups based on the effects of acetazolamide
on their CBF. Of the 68 patients, 10 suffered
strokes within an average of five months after
their examination.

“This study indicates that strategies for study
and treatment of stroke must involve aggres-
sive, early identification and intervention if they
are to have maximum impact because of the
relative early occurrence of stroke after only
five months,” Yonas said.

Eight of the 10 strokes occurred in the second
group, which was diagnosed as high risk within
the study due to low CBF measurements found
during Xenon/CT scanning.

The Xenon/CT scan revealed regions of the
brain which were more at risk of stroke due to
a low level of blood flow. All eight patients in
the second group suffering strokes had them in
the same regions indicated as risky by the scan.
The other two in group one, which had a high-
er CBF measurements, had strokes in regions
opposite of those indicated by the scanning.

“While our stroke victims did have signifi-

Q   .
SK Walk for Pride viewed as success

By Sam Gresock
Staff Writer

Much like Pitt’s near—victory

. against Syracuse last Saturday

afternoon, Friday evening’s 5K
Walk for Panther Pride can be
viewed as a success.

At least that is the opinion of
Student Government Board
member Tara Munkatchy.

According to Munkatchy, 137
people registered for the 5K,
which began at 7 13.111. in front
of the Cathedral of Learning.
The walk raised $274 in pledges

. for Family Foundations, a pro-

ject of Pitt"s Office of Child
Development which serves low-
income families in the Oakland
area.

“Ideally I would have liked to
see more people there,”
Munkatchy said.

“But I was very satisﬁed with
the turnout because there were

no rewards, no prizes and no T —
shirts [given to participants].
These people did it solely to
help others.”

Pitt student Katie Lauer, one
of those who completed the
hike up Forbes Avenue, "across
Morewood Avenue and down
Fifth Avenue, said the 5K pro-
vided good volunteer experi-
ence.

“It was definitely worth-
while,” Lauer said.

“I wantedito help raise some
moneyllfor Family Founclationsl,
and I think it was good_to get
campus involvement for a dif-
ferent philanthropy than the
usual ones.”

In addition to raising money
for Family Foundations,
Munkatchy said one of the 5K’s
goals was to improve Pitt’s pub-
lic image.

“With so many negative inci-
dents surrounding the university

If you can’t

during the summer, I thought
[the 5K] would increase pride in
the university and at the same
time give something back to the
community,” she said.

Munkatchy said SGB mem-
bers Brian Bolton, Tony Moody
and President Jacob Brody took
part in the event.

Brody, who delivered open-
ing remarks at the 5K, also con-
sidered the walk successful.

“I’m glad to see so many peo-
ple got out to do something as
simple as helping a good
cause,” he said.

Juanita Anderson, Family
Foundations’ neighborhood
coordinator, said the organiza-
tion was pleased with students’
participation in the 5K.

“It’s definitely wonderful that
the students did what they did,”
Anderson said. “It says they
understand the issues, and they
want to make things better.”

Higher Educatio_n, there are
two main components to the
athletic part of Title IX.

The first is that spending on
women’s and men’s sports must
be comparable to the ratio of
male to female athletes.

In the 1990-91 academic year,
women made up a total of 21.9
percent of the total number of ,
athletes, while only 13.9 per-
cent of the total expenditures
were on women’s sports,
according to Sprague’s updated
figures. I

The second component is that
the proportion of male to
female athletes must generally
reﬂect the proportion of male to
female members of the general
student body.

Sprague said that in 1990-91
women constituted 48.2 percent
of the student body, but only
21.9 percent of athletes were
women.

a third party has made contact
with her biological mother.

“I have not spoken to my bio-
logical mother,” she said. “I
have no desire to do that.”

Jessen has never heard from
her biological father either, and
she said she “has no desire to
speak with him.” .

Though she said she wishes
to remain apart from her biolog-
ical parents, Jessen has “forgiv-
en” her biological mother for
the decision to have an abor—
tion. -

“I am not at all angry with
her,” she said.

“It will never change who my
family is  the ones who raise
you and loveyou and give you
your values,” she said.

Jessen said she discovered on
Christmas Day at age 12 that her
biological mother had attempt-
ed to abort her when Jessen
queried her mother about the
cause of her cerebral palsy.

Jessen first spoke publicly
about her story at age 14.
Afterwards, media exposure
and word of mouth set off a
flurry of invitations to speak.

"'I’ll do it as long as I can
sing,” Jessen said.

Despite her hectic schedule
involving long days, frequent
travel and tutoring on airplanes,
Jessen said she enjoys travelling
to tell her story.

“We have a blast. Everyday
we’re going on an adventure,”
she said.

Jessen asserted that she seeks
only to tell her story when

speaking and does not want to

debate the abortion issue.
When an audience member

questioned Jessen for saying the

“pain of childbirth lasts only

shortly,” while “the pain of an

abortion lasts a lifetime,” Jessen
refused to argue the point.

“I will not enter a debate,” she
said. “I will walk out of here
before I do.”

Another audience member
asked what Jessen felt was “a
realistic solution to unplanned
pregnancy.”

“Don’t hop into bed,” she
replied. “I believe people can
have something called self—con-
trol.” _

“I believe abortion is murder,”

The total expenditures for
1990-91 for men’s sports were
$6,450,375.

The total expenditures for
women’s sports were
$1,044,483. Sprague said, “I
don’t think anyone at the
University of Pittsburgh was
surprised when the numbers
came out.”

Savage said, “This isn’t the
first [Title IX complaint] I’ve
done, I was involved in one at
the University of Illinois in the
19805. What will happen is the
university will develop an
agreement with the agency on
how the university will address
any deficiencies found.”

Sprague said Athletic Director
Oval Jaynes and Pitt Chancellor

   

BACK B POPULAR

J. Dennis O'Connor were both
aware of the problems at Pitt
when they came here.

She said, “I think they are
working toward [gender equali-
tyl.”

“I don’t think there’s room in
education for discrimination. I
work hard for all our athletes to
compete,” Sprague said. I

Before February of 1992 all
complaints were handled by the
Office of Civil Rights.

However it is now possible
for complainants to sue univer-
sities which discriminate
in athletics on the basis of gen-
der. 9 4

Savage said, “A person would
have the right to file suit in the

Mary Beddingfield, who had
an abortion 16 years ago, also
spoke to the audience last night.

“I felt that I was alone and
that it was the only alternative,”
she said.

Beddingfield, former presi- '

dent of the Pittsburgh chapter of
Women Exploited by Abortion,
said the trauma mothers experi-
ence after having an abortion is
analogous to being a “victim of
a violent crime.”

“Post-abortion syndrome is a
very real and very serious corn-
plication,” she said.

Beddingfield said the damage
caused by her “cold and imper-
sonal” abortionist to her cervix
is responsible for several mis-
carriages she has had since the
abortion.

“I cannot believe he would

have been so callous if not for

performing years of abortions,”
she said.

Beddingfield said the “three
or four minutes of counseling"
she received was not sufficient
to help her decide whether or
not to abort the baby.

sue,” she said.

“While our stroke victims did have significantly lower base-

He also said he is hopeful that the new awareness of CBF

"A ”for average

Universities are founded (in Pitt’s case a few centuries
ago) on the premises of enlightenment and the further
advancement of not only the mind but civilization in
general. A

Many would agree that in many respects these goals
have been fulfilled, and the educational system, espe-
cially that of higher education, is one that has inspired
pride. _ _

But it is becoming evident that the goals most univer-
sities set out to achieve when they were founded in the
distant past are being jeopardized to a frightening
degree. A
‘ At many universities, especially upper crust ones like

“ the Ivy League schools, the most difficult grade to

achieve in college these days is a 

According to an article in the Oct. 18, 1995 issue of
‘ US‘. News and World Report, those receiving a  in a
college classroom are becoming an endangered
species.

In a recent article in the Chronicle of Higher
l:‘cZucatz'on, Harvard instructor William Coleisaid a gen-
eration or two ago students who mentally dropped out
of classes settled for “a gentlemen’s C.” But now
according to Cole, less than satisfactory students get a
“gentleperson’s B” and “a gentleperson’s A—.” 9

As tuition at many colleges has climbed, what is
' known as “grade inflation” has risen as well. For

instance, at Harvard in -1992, 91 percent of undergradu-
ates were B- students or higher. Other schools that suf-
fer from top-heaviness "of “As” and “Bs” include respect-

ed institutions like -Stanford and Princeton. At .

Princeton, the number of As increased from 53 percent
of all grades to 40 percent in just four years.

A possible reason for this problem, according to U.S.
News, is that colleges and universities are competing for
a pool of students who expect and sometimes demand
good grades from their professors.

Martin ‘Meyerson, former president of the University
of Pennsylvania, said that professors and instructors, in
order to avoid the hassle caused by many students over
grades, just give higher marks. Good grades sustain
enrollment in the various university departments and
are undoubtedly a. sign of success on the part of the fac-
ulty. I

‘ How the University of Pittsburgh stacks" up in relation
to some of the universities mentioned above is difficult

' 4 to tell. Information on the percentage of low grades

given o_r the number of seniors graduating with honors
is confidential, according to the College of Arts and
Science dean’s office.

This problem can only hurt the students who can
relax and expect high rewards. The entire system is
being delegitimized and the days of preparing students
for the realworld are gone.

In real life one is not rewarded for less than satisfacto-

. ry work.

Education needs new lesson plan

Many years ago a Greek
philosopher named Diogenes
wrote that “the foundation of
every state is the education of
its youth.” Although this is just
good common sense, the con-

‘cept behind it appears to have

fallen on deaf ears for many
Americans and most of our
elected leaders.

The U.S. is the only industrial-
ized nation in the world that has
let its education system fall into
disarray, and we are doing
absolutely nothing to improve
the education of our children.
About the only time education

, is mentioned in the media or by

politicians is during the presi-
dential campaigns. Then every-
body becomes “concerned”
about our woefully inadequate
and failing public schools, low
education budgets, violence in
our schools, etc.

In many U.S. cities the inner-
city high school dropout rates
range from 70-90 percent with
Miami topping the list with a
dropout rate of 92 percent
(“This Week With David
Brinkley,” Sept. 13, 1993).
Besides keeping many of our
children ignorant, these high
drop out rates have other far-
reaching consequences. Crime,
gang violence and drugs are a
few of the problems that affect

large segments of our society ‘

today.

‘deteriorated so rapidly over the

past two decades. We need to
put more money into our edu-
cation system and ensure that
all of our children have an
equal opportunity to receive a
quality education. Many of our

Third World nations. This situa-
tion cannot continue if the U.S.

The U.S. can learn much
about education from the East

outscore U.S. students in math

the mothers play a key role in
the education of their children.
They are called kyoiku mamas,

Asian nations have some of the
largest GNP growth rates in the
world, and it is instrumental in
transforming East Asia into the
world’s most economically
potent region.

All of those nations have state
education ministries which
focus on teaching people as a

Breakdowns,
yellow ﬂags
to be addressed,

Majors vows

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt offense moved the
ball well against Syracuse this
past Saturday.

Too bad the men in the
black-and-white striped shirts
—— with yellow handkerchiefs
in hand — moved the ball
effectively against Pitt.

Amassing 88 yards on 11
penalties, the referees did
their share of ball control and
movement against the
Panthers.

But amidst the “zebra” boos,
there was still only one place
to lay the blame.

“We had a good chance to
win the ball game if we don’t
kill ourselves with penalties,”
Pitt head coach john Majors
said of Pitt’s close 24-21 loss to
the nationally-ranked
Orangemen at yesterday’s
weekly press conference.

Stubbing its toes with sever-
al penalt.ies in crucial situa-
tions, Pitt still had a chance to
win the football game in the

fourth quarter.

“I thought our football team
looked more like a team than
any" other time this year, even
the first game,” Majors said.
“Our offensive execution was
better overall.” _ ,

But the yellow ﬂags went a
and the offensive
improvement so visibly shown
became mired with penalties.

“It’s encouraging to play this
type, of "game and have a
chance to beat a team ‘that is

consistently in the top rank-
ings,” Majors said. “But the
breakdowns just killed us
because we had an adequate
chance to win.” \ - '

The ﬁnal Pitt chance to win,
or at least tie, came in the
fourth quarter.

On a fourth and two from
the Syracuse three—yard line,
with the Orangemen up by
three points, Majors decided
to go for the win instead of the
game—tying field goal.

But Majors’ ﬁnal decision to
go for the first down and the
win was partly based on the
offensive mistakes.

“I was frustrated the offense
stopped themselves,” Majors
said. “I felt like we gave up

‘ too many big plays on defense

and too many penalties on
offense.

“If we tie the game on a
field goal, Syracuse had plenty
of time to score again, our
defense let up three big pass

‘ plays already,” Majors said.

So the decision was thought
out thoroughly while the emo-
tion of the players and fans
were pushing to go for the
win. ‘

“The players and fans
always want to go for it, but,I

' made the decision, and I don’t

regret it,” Majors added.

The penalties, however,
were something Majors does
regret. ‘

Pitt defense improves  save

By Tom Schneider ' ' _  A

Staff Writer  ’

As the old adage goes, a chain
is only as strong as. its weakest
link.

Judging by this widely regard-
ed theory, it would seem logical
to assume that when repairing
that link we must remember not
to sacrifice another.

Unfortunately for the Pitt foot-
ball team, the mystical forces
that control this delicate balance
were not on its side during last
Saturday’s heartbreaking loss to
Syracuse.

In the Panthers’ four convinc-
ing defeats preceding the
Syracuse game, what perhaps
could be described as the weak-
est link (among many) was Pitt’s
rushing defense.

The Panther “D” had given up
an average of 296.4 yards on the
ground going into Saturday’s
game, including an incredible
500 yards by Virginia Tech.

Opposing backs barrelled
through the Panther defensive
corps regularly, accumulating
60 percent of their total offense
and 64 percent of their first
downs by way of the ground
attack. I 1

Against Syracuse, however,
the Pitt front line improved by
leaps and bounds. It thwarted
nearly everything that came its
way, holding the Orange to ‘116
marginally—effective rushing
yards.

The line even batted down

“In many ways, it was consis-

far,” head coach Johnny Majors
said. “We had an outstanding

Though the Panthers were
able to stop Syracuse’s running
attack, the excellent pressure by
the front line forced Orange QB
Marvin Graves to take to the air
waves, where they ultimately
won the game.

Graves completed 13 of only
19 passes overall, but several
long ‘pass plays gave him a total
of 328 yards on the day — an
average of 25 yards per comple-
tion.

“Marvin has been bailing us

coach John Pasqualoni said.
“I’m just glad that we had him

Seemingly, whenever one of his
passes was not batted down at
the line of scrimmage, Graves
would find a receiver and hit
him in stride as he was blowing

In three separate Syracuse
scoring drives, all originating
from deep in Orange territory,
Graves threw touchdown pass-
es of 64 and 38 yards and com-
pleted two other passes of 59

Men's tennis
splits two
at Buffalo

By Brady Slater
Staff‘ Writer

A rainy forecast for last
Saturday morning forced
the Pitt men’s tennis team
to play two matches last
Friday in Buffalo where it
beat Canisius and then
lost to SUNY Buffalo five
hours later.

I “It was a real weird
weekend,” James
Chronister said.

The Panthers (5-1)
began their Canisius
match at noon and

pounded the Golden
Griffins 7-0.

“The score was indica-
tive of an easy match,”
Chronister said. “Which
helped us, since we had
to play later in the day.”

After the Canisius
match the team drove
back to its hotel. The
players had an hour to eat
and an hour to warm up
prior to their 8 p.m. match
with SUNY Buffalo.’

The match was played
at the hotel’s indoor facili-
ty because the SUNY
Buffalo coach couldn’t get
indoor court time for the
originally . scheduled
Saturday morning out-
door match.

“We c1idn’t have a lot of
time to digest,” Chronister
said.

The time constraints
could have cost the
Panthers, who lost several
close matches in falling to
SUNY Buffalo 5-2.

“We were.all a little
tired,” Brad Wade said. “It

J came down to tiebreak-
ers, and we couldn’t win
them.” '

“They’re traditionally
tough, and we’ve never
beaten them since I’ve
been here,” Chronister
said. “But now we know
we can compete with
them this weekend.”

The Panthers will play
in the Dusquesne Invite
this weekend.

Women's
X-country
defeats

St. Francis

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer

For the second week in
a row, the women of the
University of Pittsburgh’s
cross country team came
home victorious.

The Lady Panthers ven-
tured to St. Francis
University and clobbered
their opponentsin the
Red Flash Cross Country
Invitational.

When all the points_
were tallied up, the final
score read Pitt 30 (points),
Duquesne 47, Canisus 50,
Saint Francis 111, Loyola,
Md., 149, St. Bonaventure
155 and Niagara 179.

Head coach Steve Lewis
was more than happy I
with the Lady Panthers’
latest victory.

“They did a great job,”
Lewis said;

“As far as the team is
concerned, this is our first
Out—Of—conference invita-
tional win. The team ran
very well.”

, Running well is exactly
, what Pitt did. ,
This group, picked in
the preseason to finish
last in the Big East
- Conference, showed
. spunk by tackling one of A

the roughest courses on
. the East Coast.

The team used its
sprinters’ mentality from.
the starting line, forcing
the competitors to change
their game plan._

For the third time in a
row, rookie sensation
Angie Martin stood out
from the rest of the field.

“At the 100—yard mark,
Angie was leading the
pack by 25 yards,” Lewis
said. “As the race wore
on, Martin opened up her
lead.” A

Martin’s time of 20 min-
utes and 49 seconds set a
new course record.

“We need more discipline,
especially with our hands on
the holding, penalties,” Majors
said. “I know we can improve
on our penalties, and I expect
them to.

“I hope the West Virginia
rivalry will be a factor,” Majors
said.

It should. The “Backyard
Brawl” Often brings the best out
in both teams.
~Pitt’s best to date, running
back Curtis Martin, feels the 15
Panthers, despite their penal-
ties, will grow out of the
Syracuse loss and into the West
Virginia game this coming
Saturday. P

“I feel that [Syracuse] is a step-
ping stone to build Off of,”
Martin said. “It gave us confi-
dence, and it gave us an extra
boost.

“This team is not ‘giving up.
An [excellent] attitude is there.”

Majors is not giving up either.

“The_loss hurt, but I’m proud
of this team,” Majors said. “I’m
not devastated by the loss. I’m
never devastated by a loss, it

just hurt.”

How about handling a 1-5
record? A

Martin answered this.

“It’s not hard at all,” the junior

running back explained of his _

mentality after Pitt’s first six
games. “You just have to be a
player under the coaching I’m
under. ,

“It’s a rebuilding process 
this team is up and coming,”
Martin said.

PITT NOTES: Two bright
spots in Pitt’s 24-21 loss to
Syracuse, running back Curtis
Martin and defensive back Jay
Jones were recognized by the
Big East conference this week.

Martin, co—offensive Big East
Player of the Week with
Rutgers’ Terrell Willis, ran for
206 yards on 57 carries and
scored one touchdown..

Jones, Big East Special Teams
Player of the Week, returned his
second punt return of the sea-
son 84 yards for a touchdown.
His quick jaunt gave Pitt an

long run of his own.

He took off down the left side
and warded Off_ defenders until
he was able to find a streaking
Tonkin who took the ball in for
the try. _

The conversion was good,
and the Panther fans on the
sidelines had.something to
cheer about at 26-14.

But WVU broke the momen-
tum when it scored immediately
after the second try.

The -score stood at 33-14 and
time ran out on the Panthers
season.

Despite the loss, Coach Tom
Miller was pleased with the per-

formance. .

“We had two hard games in
one day,” coach Miller said

“We played hard and came
back in the second game after
we were down big.”

The Panthers ended the sea-
son at 4-2 with both losses to
WVU. ;

It was the first postseason
appearance in the history of

. rugby at Pitt.

“This is a young team that had
a great year,” Miller added. “I’rn
proud and the school should be

_ proud.” '

The Pitt rugby team returns to
regular season action in the
spring of 1994.

D’
Cont. from page 6
This collapse of the Pitt

secondary was in contrast

to its performance over
the previous five games,
in which it allowed an
average of 202 yards per

game.
But then again, the

’ Panthers were not facing

deep threats like Shelby
Hill and Marvin Harrison

‘in the first five games.

Predictably, they are the
top two receivers in the
Big East, with Hill averag-
ing 107 yards per game
and Harrison averaging
over 20 yards per recep-
tion.

Graves did spread the
wealth, and the big darn-
age was ultimately done
by junior tight end Eric
Chenoweth, who had
only nine receptions com-
ing into Saturday’s con-
test.

His 59-yard reception
set up the winning field
goal

“I don’t think our sec-
ondary call_ was coordi-
nated with the defensive
call,” Majors said. “That
means that it wasn’t
