Vol. 71 No. a 

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL -
and BETSY NORMAN

Pitt’s senior staff will recom-
mend a budget including a $100 to
$150 increase in two-term under-
graduate tuition at this afterndon’s
Boardof Trustees meeting, the Pitt
News has learned.

According to several sources,
including persons involved in
University budget deliberations and
members of the University Senate
budget policies committee, Pitt’s
administration will propose one set
of ﬁgures—+including a tuition hike

of approximately 10 percent for

undergraduates and similar in-
creases for other students—that
will assume passage of Gov.
Shapp’s recommended state opera-
ting budget. ‘

Should Senate Bill 771, Shapp’s.

recommended budget, be modiﬁed
by legislators to increase higher
education funding, Pitt students
still would face a third consecutive
rise in tuition; but the increase
would be less than 10 percent, the
sources said last night.

A student member of the budget ,

policies committee has said the
increase would be $150 if Shapp’s
budget is enacted, and $100 if more
state money is appropriated.

* ' University administrators last

night declined comment, but one
vice chancellor said,‘ ‘We’re hoping
and planning on the state budget.”

One source saidthe impact would
be greater at one professional
school, possibly ‘law, whose tuition
is believed to be “a bargain
compared to other professional
schools here.” But, most sources
stressed, proposed increases in
other schools would generally fall
into the $100-$150 range.

Pitt undergraduates paid $1,210
for two terms’ education this fall
and winter. That was an increaseof
six ‘percent over 1975-76 tuition.

A $100 increase in two-term
tuition would ‘make students’
per-term bill $655. 1' I

The only way Pitt students could
avert a cutback in state funding of
higher education would be to travel

Ph.D. Student Develops
Money Forecast     I

By MREA CSORBA

A Pitt doctoral candidate
developed a computer-based model
that can predict the feasibility of
business proposals.

In a team effort with the Greater
Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce
and Pitt’s graduate department of
economics, Ph. D student Edward
Malloy compiled a model which will

enable Pittsburgh community and. '

business leaders to gauge the

impact of ventures before investing

into them large sums of money.

Proposals are now ﬁnancially
predictable. For example, the
Malloy model, predetermined the
proposed convention center’s four
million dollar revenue for the city.

A second study performed by the
model, calculated business gains
from Pirate games. Computing the
spendings of fans before and after
games, it was found that Pittsburgh
businesses would lose $21 million
without the city’s major league
baseball team.

With the cooperation of the
Chamber of Commerce, it would
have taken a year to compilethe
necessary data to run this test.
With the model, such studies take
10 minutes to run, Malloy said, at a
press conference Friday.

The model divides city busi-
nesses into 56 sectors according to
the similarity of their products or
services, Malloy stated. Data was
collected from each of these sectors

on production input and sales. The --

 

information was then logged in
tables that can be altered to account
for the effects of changing
technology.

The model can, then compute
economic variables on both direct
and indirect levels. For example,
Malloy explained, the computer
model will be able to foretell the

direct impact of a new company

Nyden Offered 1 5-Montl1sPqQtt

The text of Chancellor Posvar’; letter
to N yden appears on page 2.

By MREA CSORBA

Chancellor Wesley Posvar has
offered Paul Nyden a 15-month
‘reinstatement as an assistant
sociology professor directly respon-

V sible to the Faculty of Arts and

Sciences Dean Jerome Rosenberg.

Nyden, who in the past year has
fought for a three-year contract
renewal, told the ‘Pitt News
yesterday that he will sign the
Chancellor’s proposal under pro-
test. He is currently drafting his
statement to be delivered with his
signature to the Chancellor’s office
before a May 26 deadline.

The offer, retroactive till May 1,
1977, will remove the controversial
sociologist from close contact with
_his "department by specifying he
receive his teaching assignments

 

 

may be the cheapest lunch in town; you don’t get change

,_'

 

from Rosenberg, who will also be

_ his primary evaluator.

In a letter given to _Nyden
Thursday evening, the Chancellor
said it was his~“difficult task” to
implement the recent recommen-
dation of the Senate Council hearing’
board while- responding to the

. preferences of the sociology depart- -

ment.

While he fought to have his
contract renewed, Nyden allegedly
alienated many sociology depart-
ment members. i

In meetings with the Chancellor,
Nyden’s collegues expressed
doubts “a workable collegial
relationship: could be reestab-
lished,” Posvar reported in his
letter to Nyden.

In addition, Rosenberg is to
arrange Nyden’s relocation to
another floor in Mervis Hall.--until

The 15-month special assignment

Although he could not specify
course changes, Rosenberg said
Nyden will resume teaching next
fall. ‘ ‘No punitive, measures will be
taken against him,” Rosenberg
said. “I am waiting for him to
contact me. Then we will work out
his assignment.”

Following this offer, Rosenberg
said Nyden would be eligible for a
two-year contract before being
considered for tenure. Rosenberg,

who last January upheld the.

sociology department’s vote for the
non-renewal of Nyden’s contract,
said he would enlist the help of two
sociologists for Nyden’s -next
contract consideration.

“If “he was honest, he would
decline his supervisory role over
me, ’ ’ Nyden maintained yesterday.
“He has repeatedly said he cannot
judge me as a sociologist and he has
never heeded my protest over the
department's evaluative defects. ’ ’

Nyden said he is worried how the
proposed committee of three will
evaluate him. Although, Nyden
said, if they evaluate him fairly, he
is confident his recent and
"prospective works will measure-up.

“I am to present two different
papers at two sociology conferences-
soon” he" said. ‘‘I will have
published other papers by then and
my dissertation will be in book

.form.”

Rosenberg maintained his rela-
tionship with Nyden will be strictly
administrative. Stating, “I am
accustomed to dealing with persons
on an administrative level.”

No One To Talk To? 7

Textof Dr. Posvar's
Letter to Paul Nyden

Dear Dr. Nyden:

The Hearing Board that was convened to hear your appeal has
completed its work, and you have been sent a copy of its report. As
you know, and as we discussed. the report cleared the Department,
the Dean of the Faculty, and all other persons on all of Y0“?
allegations, except in one respect: that in a 15-month period of time
in 1974 and 1975, between the reports of the two Special Review
Committees of the Department, the Department failed to
communicate adequately to you its expectations regarding criteria
and evidence of professional productivity, and that this conceivably.
could have adversely affected your chance for renewal of
appointment. 3

Ihave met with the Hearing Board to discuss its ﬁndings and to
seek its advice concerning what would be an equitable remedy in light
of the possible misunderstanding concerning your colleagues’
evaluation of your work. The offer that follows conforms in all
respects with therviews of the Hearing Board and, in their judgment,
fully remedies any ﬂaw.

The Department of Sociology has also communicated its views to
me. They feel that intervening acts since_ March 1976 have so

completely destroyed the trust whichmust exist among members of I

an academic faculty that a workable collegial relationship could not be
reestablished at this time.

I consider it my difficult task in this case both to follow the intent
of the recommendation of the Hearing Board and to preserve the

academic system of the university. That system stems from
professional review of faculty members by persons qualiﬁed in the
given discipline or field of study, as it also depends fundamentally
upon respect for truth and upon free ‘expression in an atmosphere of
mutual civility. In order to protect these values, ‘it is my carefully
considered conclusion that the administration of a university may not
force a faculty to -admit to participation in their collegial ranks a
member who in their serious view obstructs these values. In this

matter, I cannot substitute my judgment for theirs; I can only insist —

that they exercise it fairly, to the best of their ability. In this case I am
satisﬁed that the test of fairness has been met.

In a meeting with me; the Hearing Bo/ard“recommended.that you
should be granted a 15-month period, to make up for the previous
interval, in which to show further professional development and be
evaluated. While I am not bound to accept this recommendation of
the Hearing Board, Ihave decided to do so because of the particular
circumstances involved. Accordingly, I offer you a special
appointment as anassistant professor of sociology within the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences forthe period May 1, 1977 through August 31,

1978. You will be given a salary for the fall and winter terms. In order '

to facilitate further your professional development, you will also be
given a stipend for a non-teaching appointment during each of the
spring terms of 1977 and 1978.

To enable you to meet your responsibilities and organize your
work, you will be assigned to the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences for administrative purposes and you will function under the
personal supervision of Dean Jerome L. Rosenberg. He will assign

. your teaching duties, time for research, and ofﬁce space. In keeping
with the Hearing Board’s recommendations, you will be advised by
the Dean of the standards and accomplishments that will be
expected. The faculty of the Department of Sociology retains the
option to invite you at any later _time to participate in their regular

meetings, should you and they reach accommodation. They also may

request your administrative reassignment to the Department.

Dean Rosenberg will make arrangements for you toymove to
another ﬂoor in Mervis Hall, so that you will still be able to proﬁt from
scholarly interactions with those members of the Department of

V Sociology with whom you have maintained or will gain new useful

relationships. Future change invofﬁce assignment may be made,
subject to available space, if requested by the Department of
Sociology.

Your professional development will be monitored by a committee
of three chaired by Dean Rosenberg, including two sociologists
chosen by him. Your prospect for further renewal and promotion will
be based upon a total view of your past performance and your
demonstrated competence as they reveal existing and prospective
strengths as a scholar, teacher, and constructive contributor to the
intellectual life of the University. These stand as the core criteria for
your ‘evaluation, as they do for all faculty. Your evaluation will be
made directly by the senior faculty of the Department of Sociology or
be delegated by them to the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
and the monitoring committee, who may employ the advice of other
scholars in your ﬁeld. The normal dean's level review of personnel
decisions would in this case be performed by the Provost.

Because this is a special appointment, its terms take precedence
over the provisions of paragraph seven in the “Appointments and
Tenure” section of the Faculty Handbook, as pertaining to notice of
non-renewal and to number and length of appointments. You will be
informed no later than July 1, 1978 whether you will be continued as
an assistant professor with an opportunity to be considered for
tenure, or be terminated as of August 31, 1978.

It is essential that we regain a positive working scholarly
environment that will contribute to good morale and a productive
attitude within the Department of Sociology as well as throughout the
University. Any deliberate disruption of the academic environment is
prohibited. The rights and responsibilities of all members of the

‘ University community must be respected. If you are to remain a

member of this academic community, you will be expected to
contribute to these purposes.

This offer will remain open through May 26, 1977 unless rejected
prior thereto. If you accept the terms of this offer, please sign the

attached copy and return it to Dean Rosenberg.

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh "

The Students’ Stake

Several of the Universityis highly placed administrators will
travel to the Greensburg campus for this afternoon’s 1:45 approve-
the-tuition-hike Board of Trustees meeting with the se_nior,staff’s
recommended increase secured in their briefcases. Many others
will have a good idea of those crucial numbers before they hit the
Parkway. But as unarrestable as that increase may be, most per-

‘ sons involved in the decision will have time to pick up today’s Pitt

News before the presentation and vote, so the students’ stake in this
issue bears repeating. .

To be sure, no rational student can rest blame for what would be
Pittfs third annual tuition increase anywhere inside the Cathedral.
Though the senior staff made the calculations and the Trustees will
approve their findings, the figures came from Harrisburg. We find

it hard to believe the vice chancellors, executive assistants, and their
consultants enjoyed their task. In fact, we’d like to believe they
still care about the bill-laden students’ plight. ‘

But the simple truth is there’s no apparent way to avoid a hike

., without severely impairing the school’s ability to provide «worth-

while education. At‘ least, not with the Governor’s recommended
appropriation to higher education.

l

Gov. Shapp may be luckyhe cannot seek a third term as Penn-
sylvania’s top man, for he would likely find that his support, at
least among students and their families, would be as weak as when
he ran for president. A Governor who strangles higher education
whilelfunding an arts center in the Poconos stands little chance of
reelection.  , ,

But, though they are blameless, Pitt’s administors should not
throw up their hands, and neither should Trustees, especially when
the vote to approve the hike is put on the table.’ They should try, as
Rugge'ro Aldisert did a year ago, to find a way out, hopeless as the ’
task may seem. At the least, they should cushion the blow. it is,
quickly becoming the economic case that the next person they deny
an education could be their own. A

p

   iTo A Nicer Summer

Anice idea teamed with a nice day to provide an enjoyable noon-
time for those Pitt students who visited the Student Union patio
yesterday afternoon for the first of what promises to be a long
series of outdoor musical cafes.

The program; sponsored by four groups—the Resident Student

_ Association, the Student Union Board, the Office of Student Ac-

_J  ‘ THE PITT NEWS is the official student newspaper of the University of

itivities and Student Government-—is a great way to use activities

fees collected from summer students for the benefit of those
students. Each weekday, the University community will be able to
enjoy an afternoon with free music, free soft drinks and one—dollar

Chapman Outlines Nyden Recommendation Faults

According to the Nyden hearing
board: “The procedural defect,
then, is in the lack ‘of notice given
to Dr. Nyden that, contrary to
normal expectations, his disserta-
tion would be given little weight
and that the revision of the
manuscript for publication pur-
poses would not be given signiﬁ-
cant weight.”

At the beginning of this crucial
paragraph, the board says, “it
may be customary practice in u...
department of sociology to make an
evaluation of professional develop-‘
ment without strong regard for

prior achievement without strong
regard for prior achievement.”

The board then goes on to assert

that to make ‘ ‘professional develop- ‘

ment” “the primary basis” of
assessment, presumably. without
“strong regard for prior achieve-
ment,” although that may be the
“customary practice” of the

-department, is “contrary to normal
expectations.” And as such, this
abnormal expectation or criterion
should have been explicitly com-
municated to the candidate so he
would know that he had to

demonstrate “professional de-
velopment” since his dissertation.

Failure so to notify the candidate
constitutes a “material procedural
defect” only if the department’s
expectation or criterion is . ab-A

normal, “contrary to normal
expectations. ”
Is it the case that the

department’s criterion is ab-

normal? “That is the question.

 Hcitedby the Powerful,   r
  Loved by the Citizens

By DAN MULHOLLAND

Well, today is primary election
day and sometime this evening we
should have a pretty good idea of
who our next mayor is going to be.
The campaign has been going on
for some time and all the
candidates from Kareem Ali to

Jerry Zidanic have bombarded us-

with promises of improving the lot
of those who dwell inithis fair city.
Hopefully, the winner will be able
to fulfill at least a few of those
romises, but it will take an
extraordinary effort of his part to
ineasure up to the performance of
his predecessor, Pete Flaherty.
Pete Flaherty‘ was a veritable
colossus who strode across the local
political scene of the 1970s. Rising
out of relative obscurity.on city
council in the late ’60s, be

challenged‘ the powerful but

corrupt Democratic machine which
had been built by the venerable
David Lawrence. After soundly
whipbing the organization's hand-
picked candidate in the primary, he
went on to , demolish the :
Republicans in me tall. Four years
later, when up for reelection, it
seemed that everyone——the news
media. the unions, the machine-
was against him. Everyone but the
voters.‘ Not only did he soundly
defeat the Democratic machine for
a second time. but he also captured
the Republican and Constitutional
nominations by an unconventional
write-in/sticker drive. “Nobody's
boy” had suddenly become every-
body’s.

What was the secret of his
success? The best way to find (out
is examine his critics. He was
chastised by the media for not
being “accessible,” in other

words, «not granting interviews or

news leaks to reporters whenever
they,wished. Pete was too busy
doing the job he was elected to do:

running the city. He was attacked
by the labor unions for cutting the

i city payroll. By doing so, however,

he eliminated 2,000 unneeded‘ jobs
and was able to hold the line on
higher taxes. The business
community berated him for not
pouring more tax dollars into urban
renewal.
funds to improve parks and
playgrounds in the neighborhoods
which benefitted greater numbers
of people than the membership
roster of the Duquesne Club.

He also came under ﬁre from the
“limosine liberals” of Squirrel Hill
and Shadyside because of his stand

Instead, he used those’

against forced busing and his
“general neglect of the human
services area.” A

Therein lies the secret of Pete's

success. He realized that the
average man is fed up with
politicians spending more and

more. of his money in the name of
obscure societal goals. All he
wants from government, beyond its

most basic functions, is to be left
alone. Pete Flaherty recognized
these desires and made them a
reality. In addition he was honest,
hardworking and responsive to the

wishes of the electorate. Indeed,
he was as close to the ideal public
servant as anyone could imagine.
A man of his stature will surely be
missed for years to come.

pointments to the university should

a not be made solely on the basis of

past achievement.” Suppose the
promise has not been made good,
that “professional development”
has not taken place.

Now any decision on appoint-

ment or reappointment must ’

involve a professional estimate as
to the future accomplishments of
the candidate. And as the Chicago
statement makes perfectly clear,
theprospective estimate is deci-
siv_e. Past performance is not
important in and of itself. Rather it
enters the assessment of the
candidate. as an indicator of
future performance. Again,
suppose the indication has turned
out to be misleading.

What the board is asserting is
the past performance, not prospec-
tive performance, is the appropiate
criterion to be applied,- that it is the
criterion that accords with ,“normal
expectations.” In fact, prospective
scholarly performance is a univer-
sal criterion of academic ‘appoint-
ment, universal because it is

mplied by the purposes of the
iniversity. In fact, the “customary

practice” of the department of
sociology is the “normal” practice.
Our sociologists have done what
would be done and is done in any
university. They examined all the
evidence that bears on prospective
achievement, and they correctly
gave most weight to the most
recent evidence. That is exactly
what any department would be

-expected to do.

In a university, you do not have
to tell a candidate, because you are
doing something “contrary to
normal expectations,” that his
prospects for reappointment de-
pend primarily upon his. profes-
sional development and promise,
and not upon the accomplishment
that got him the job in the first
place. Only if you assume, as does
the board groundlessly, that past
rather than ‘prospective achieve-
mentis the criterion to be applied
does failure so to inform the
candidate become a “material
procedural defect.”

In fact what the board has done
is to impose, against the common
understanding, its own irrational
criterion of appointment on the

university. 0 Their misunderstand-
ing of the criteria of academic
appointment leads them to invade,
under the guise of procedural
defectiveness, an area of substan-
tive professional judgment, in this
case one reserved to the depart-
ment of sociology.

What has gone wrong? There is
in the report no distinction drawn
between criteria of appointment
and procedures for their applica-
tion. The board refers to the
“customary practice” of the
department of sociology. The
distinction between criterion and
procedure disappears in their use
of the word “practice.” In effort

. West Coast Florida

Wish You Were There?

Pitt Food Service

By RANDY GAYSEK

Now that you’ve got Fort
Lauderdale out of your system, and
spring session is at the‘ point where
everyday life is a drag, and more
than ever you need to take off some
place, you can start thinking about
taking a real vacation. -

For those who have never visited
Florida’s west coast (indeed, many
people seem surprised to ﬁnd that
_Florida has a west coast), a
laid-back and mellow world awaits.

One hundred and twenty miles
south of Tampa lies Fort Myers, a
small, but up-and-coming town
surrounded by miles and miles of
white, clean and’ uncrowded (in
‘summer, anyway) beaches.

One reason this area is not
popular in the college world may be
its reputation as a retirement area.
True, there are a lot of senior
citizens, condominium owners and
three-wheeled bike riders, but
they’re there because it took them a
lifetime to discover how great it is to
live near the warm tranquil waters
and the matchless natural beauty
commonly called-the “Sun Coast.”

You mav ask, “Okay, after
driving 1300 miles, what’s there
to do besides play shuffleboard and

swap pictures of grandchildren?”

Well, if you don't like a place with
lots of discos, crazy street scenes
and a town crammed with
thousands of the lunatics from
eastern seaboard colleges, there’s

U R135,      

very little to do in Fort Myers. The ..

~ Metro edition of the Sunday paper is
just under 75,000, and as mentioned
earlier, quite “a few of those readers
use bi-focals. However, there are
lounges and not everyone in them
walks with a cane.
Florida’s drinking age is 18 (as if
you didn’t know) and beer and wine
are permitted on the beaches. And

there are enough beaches so you_

can have one practically’ to yourself.

The waters, surrounding Fort‘

Myers are usually calm,’ but once in
a while (especially during hurricane
season) the Gulf breeze kicks up
waves large enough for body
surﬁng, so you can scratch up your
belly all you like. ~
Accomodations are surprisingly
cheap during the summer when the
tourists, or “snowbirds’ ’ as they are
called, are up north cleaning out the
cottage. If you’ve worked hard and

. stashed away some cash, you can

get a nice motel-like room right on
the beach for a reasonable fee.
There are also compgrounds not far

:'_ from the beaches.

Since everything is so spreadpout
however, a car, bike‘ or a sturdy

thumb is a necessity for traveling. .

t’s not difﬁcult to hitch a ride, but

2 the sun gets hot on the blacktop. ~.

Well worth thumbing to is

Sanibel and Captiva islands that lie

just off the mainland. It costs three
dollars to cross the two-mile
causeway, but its a three bucks

,‘ well-spent. The trip over makes you

 

feel like you’re driving into a
postcard. You almost expect to see

“Welcome to Sanibel-Captiva”,

hanging over the islands. The water
on either side of the bridge looks
like a quarry where the Navajos get
their turquoise, and if you take your
eyes off the road for a few seconds,
chances “are you'll see a few
dolphins (no, not Bob Greasy or Don
Shula) rolling among the pilings.
Seclusion best describes these
islands. The toll keeps a lot of
people away. People are friendly,

but everyone minds their own,

business. Everyone walks around
with their heads bent, not because
they’re depressed, but because
Sanibel is said to be one of the
world’s best places for shelling.
Each tide washes tons of new shells
ashore. The sand on the beaches is
actually crushed seashells. Enough
remain intact, however, for you to
bring some back to your aunt.

Skin diving 1} popular in the area
too. Though not as clear as in the
Keys, the water is warm and
shallow. Swimming here is said to
be the safest in the country because
there is no undertwo, and for some
reason, the sharks have little
appetite for human ﬂesh.‘

Fishing is also a popular pastime
in the Fort Myers area. People line
every bridge and pier, with fishing
rods in hand. Deep sea ﬁshing
boats sail 40 miles into the Gulf of
Mexico and return with happy,
ﬁsh-laden passengers. It’s a nice
way to spend a day and about 12
bucks. _ ‘

So you see, there are things to do
in a quiet section of Florida. '

I   Calling All Hamburgers

-One Year Ago-

By BETSYNORMAN

If you laid 5,500 hamburgers end
to end, the line would be longer
than six football ﬁelds, 611 yards to
be exact or more than three times
the height of the Cathedral. Five
thousand five hundred hamburgers
is a lot of beef and that's how many
hamburgers Towers cafeteria‘
serves in a single lunch period
during the fall and winter terms.

The cafeteria is just like your
kitchen at home, Pitt's dietician
Barbara Bungo claimed, only on a
larger scale.

Serving 2,000 pounds of hand-
carved beef for one meal, 55
gallons of ice cream_\daily, 200
dozen doughnuts at a single
Sunday brunch and 175 gallons of
white milk a day, the Towers is the
largest cafeteria in Pittsburgh. The
food service, working with an
annual budget in excess of $3
million, offers an average of 8,000
meals a day and employes about 150
people, including 14 cooks.

“We use only the highest quality
food here,” Bungo said. “We use
Heinz pickles and condiments, and
Chase & Sanborn coffee. And the
students should notice a big change
in the hamburgers. With all the

competition from the fast food I

chains, we must improve our
burgers. We are now serving an
institutional hamburger, but we'll
soon switch to a 100 percent,
_all-beef burger on grilled -buns.

We are constantly trying
improve our food, Bungo stated.
We switched brands of doughnuts
because students didn't like them.
Now we can’t get enough of them,
she said.

The menu works on a 28-day

cycle. When I write the menu, I try
not to use too much pork or beef. I
always serve something for the
vegetarians and I take into account
all religious holidays. I’m always
looking for new entrees, and I
attend restaurant associations for
new ideas, Bungo continued.

“All our food is nutritionally
sound and each meal is balanced.
But, I can’t force a student to eat a
balanced meal. The student
chooses his own food.”

The biggest selling meal
the hamburger, Bungo said. The

homemade pizza also sells well, in

addition to the deli-line meats.

Besides the two cafeterias in the
Towers and Lothrop dining room,
Pitt food service runs the Scaife
Hall, the graduate school and the
Student Union snack bars.

“We_also do a lot of catering all
over the University," Bungo said.
“The menus range from a simple’
outdoor picnic for the fraternities to
a gourmet meal for a Chancellor’s
reception. Our prices are
reasonable compared to outside
caterers."

“During the fall and winter, we
cater approximately 120 events a

The Feminization of American
Culture

By Ann Douglas

Alfred A. Knopf

Author Ann Douglas’ first book
deals with the underlying causes,
meanings and influences of the
phenomenon of the alliance be-
tween women and clergy during
the 1800s. This alliance is
important for it laid the ground-
work for the stereotypic role of
women in American society.

In the 1820s, two disenfran-
chised groups——the clergy and
middle-class women—were in-
creasingly relegated to the edges of
society. Eventually, they became
“cultural custodians" who con-
trolled schools and social influence.
They preached a reverence-for the
qualities society imposed upon
them: timidity, naivety, disdain for
competition.

A Sizzler  
of A Play

By LINDA SPECK

The Studio Theatre presented a
hot production of ‘ ‘Hot 1 Baltimore”
Saturday night. Suzie, a hardwork-
ing prostitute, dashed across the

stage in bikini underwear, chasing a

slippery customer who had left
without paying.

» The production got even. hotter
when Jackie, a castrating cowgirl,
the ancient Mr. Morse, two more‘
prostitutes and other motley
characters started an uproar over
S\uzie’s appearance. '

“Hot 1 Baltimore” involves the
lives of these characters, who range
from the young and searching to the
old and permanent, as they become
entangled and attached to one
another in their home.

Their home, of course, is a
one-time booming train station-
hotel scheduled for demolition.’

Overall, the performances were
ﬁne—-especially Gayle Gearhart
Herring as Jackie and Nicholas
Vukmanic as Mr. Morse. You could
almost feel Jackie’s sizzling bottom
as Herring, galloped across the
stage in her well-worn cowboy
boots.

Also in keeping with his character ‘ -

was Vukmanic. His timing and
delivery . made that lovable old
geezer, Mr. Morse, odnvincing.
The “Hot 1 Baltimore” set came
close to matching the fine acting.
Old marble steps and columns,
dilapidated furniture and a realistic
hotel lobby desk created a
well-worn hotel atmosphere. The
theatre-in-the-round set was clev-

erly used by the actors, and .‘

Tracksters Stumble at Pitt Invite  

By DAVE MC DONALD

The competition at the Seventh

9‘ Anhual Pitt Invitational proved to

be too intense for the Panther
tracksters this past weekend as
they, failed to capture a single
first-place watch in the talent-laden
meet. The Panthers could muster
only one second, two thirds and two
fourth-place ﬁnishes.

 

The 440 relay team of Willie
Walker, Keith Leckenby, Larry
Shippen and Kevin Carpenter did
manage to break one of the oldest
Pitt track records on the books with
some ﬁne hand offs and good speed
with a 41.6, to break the 1940
-record by one tenth of a second.

I’ The combination of good weather

‘and good teams helped to tie or

break four meet and stadium

Pitt high jumper Dan Goodyear’s 6-8 lunge earned him a second-place finish at

records. Leading the way for the
record breakers was Penn State
Senior Paul Stemmer. Stemmer
broke Georg‘e Malley’s (a team-
mate) old six-mile record by
blazing a 28:14.4 for the distance.

Malley must have wanted his
name back in the record books, for
he eclipsed Eamonn Coglan’s
three-mile record the next after-
noon by seven seconds,,running a
13:28.0. Malley’s fast pace
overpowered Panther distance
men, but they did manage to hold

on to second and fourth places.

Mel Boyd nailed down the second
place spot with Nort McDonald
coming.in fourth.

“The first mile was too fast
(4:22),” Boyd complained. “After
that hot pace I just tried to hangon
for the next two miles.” I

Boyd’s and McDonald’s times,
which slowed considerably because
of the heat and the pace, were
14:00.9 and 14:09.5 respectively.

The record-setting team from

‘East Carolina—Calvin Alston, Car-

ter Suggs, Larry Austin and Chris
Melvin-—smashed Purdue’s 1974

record of 40.7‘for the 440 relay with _

a time of 40.6.

Delaware State’s foursome tied a
meet record in the mile relay with a
fine time of 3:09.7. This
performance ties them with Seton
Hall who ran the same time in
1975.

turned back the Panthers byathe
score of 9-0.

In the match against California
State, the Panthers were paced
with singles victories by Tom
Liebenguth over Mike Reidmayer,
6-4, 3-6, 6-3 and Kevin Quay’s 6-2,
6-2 straight set victory over the
Golden Eagles’ Randy Lang.

The remaining four Pitt singles
matches resulted in losses, how-
ever,'three of which were extended
to three sets before the outcomes
were decided. Pitt's Mike Habbel
was decisioned by California
State’s Scott Brooke, 6-4, 6-1. The
fourth, ﬁfth and sixth matches
went down to the wire as Panther
Harry Habbel was defeated by Len
Spagnolo 7-5, 6-7, 6-4; Tom Gault
lost to Gary Krauss 4-6, 7-5, 6-3;
and Chuck Brand extended Bryant
Aldstadt before bowing 6-4, 6-7,
6-1. *

Pitt tallied its other match point
in its first doubles match as Mike
Habbel and Liebenguth split their
first two sets against California
State’s Reidmayer and Krauss, but
won the third set by default.

The Golden Eagles’ Brooke and
Spagnolo defeated the second Pitt
doubles team ,of Gault and Harry
Habbel, 7-5, 6-4. In the ﬁnal
doubles match, California State
triumphed as Lang and Aldstadt
beat Quay and John Girty, 6-4, 6-3.

Dieffenbach commented that
despite the loss, the Panthers
Showed some improvement over
last year’s match won by California
State, 7-2.

“‘We were hurt by the close
losses in the number four, ﬁve and

six singles matches,” he said. “If
we would have won at least two of
those three matches, we would

have had more conﬁdence going,

into the doubles matches.”

Dieffenbach. also added that
Liebenguth and Quay played very
well in their singles matches.

A strong Bucknell squad handed
Pitt its ﬁfth regular season loss.
The only singles victory netted by
the Panthers were Mike Habbel’s
6-2, 6-2 decision over Stuart Chase.

Pitt's ﬁve remaining. singles
players fared like this: Liebenguth
lost to John Weierbach, 6-4, 6-1;
Quay lost to Adrian Huang, 6-4,

6-1; Harry Habbel was defeated by 

Peter Krieger, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3; Gault
was beaten by Larry Cohen, 6-1,
6-1, and Brand was toppled by Carl
Lloyd, 6-0, 4-6, 6-3.

The Pitt doubles duo ‘of
Liebenguth and Mike Habbel
scored a 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory over
Bucknell’s Weierbach and Krieger.

On the other hand, Bucknell
rebounded to take the other two
doubles matches as Chase and
Cohen battled to a 7-5, 6-4 decision
over Harry Habbel and Gault, and
Lloyd and Mark Willis stopped
Quay and Girty, 7-5, 6-3.
Dieffenbach also noted some
improvement in this year's match
as the Bisons handled the Panthers
last year, 8-1.

The Panthers ended its 1977
regular season with a 9-0 setback at

.the hands of traditionally “tough
Penn State.

I Dieffenbach reﬂected on the past
season by saying the 1977 regular
season record of 6-6 was an
improvement over the 5-7 state of

Swingers Lose Finale

To Temple Owls, 7-2  

By MARY S. HUZINEC

The Pitt baseball team ﬁnished
its season on a losing note Sunday
by dropping the ﬁnaleato Temple,
7-2, but coach Bob Lewis wasn’t
overly disappointed. "

“We can’t be too shocked
because they beat us,” he said.
“Temple is a good hitting ball club
and they have a lot of experience.”

Temple’s win over\ Pitt left the
Owls’ record ‘at 30-7.

Temple’s scoring attack‘ began
early with a home run in the second.

Pitt's Tony Roperti led off the third

Senior catcher Dan DeStout contributed a key double in a five-run fourth-

inning rally which propelled Pitt over Clarion, 7-4. Destout was later voted the

Temple third baseman errored.
Mark Stevens then sacrificed him to
second before Joe Adlesic stepped
to the plate and dropped a double
into.the left ﬁeld corner, driving in
Roperti. ,

Temple had big three-run innings )
in the fourth and the seventh,
raising the margin to 7-1.

Pitt‘s only other tally came when
Dan Skinner blasted a home run
over the center ﬁeld fence in the
eighth.

Starter -Les Qualk took the loss
and Dave Crist worked the last three
innings in relief.

On Friday Pitt split a double-

' header with Clarion State, losing

the ﬁrst, 6-2, and bouncing back in
the nightcap, 7-4. Poor base
running and errors cost Pitt the
game in the 6-2 loss. Don Kennedy
went the distance, giving up only
one "earned run and striking out

eight. Adlsic, John Susi and Ken..-

Muckle had two hits each.
Kennedy served up a gopher ball
in the second to make the score 1-0.
Adlesic made a difﬁcult leaping
catch on a Clarion line drive. '
Clarion scored another run in the
fourth and Pitt got a tally in the ﬁfth.
Susi led off the inning with a single
up the middle and Don Nania
w. lked. Susi taking too large of a
‘lead, was tagged out at second.
Nania moved to third when Muckler
doubled to right ﬁeld. Skinner then
grounded a single off the short-
stop’s glove, scoring Nania. '
Clarion came up with a big
four-run sixth inning, making the
score 6-1. ,
The Panthers picked up their ﬁnal
run in the bottom of the sixth. Kurt

Bennie, an army veteran
with a service disability,
has his life complicated
further by multiple
sclerosis. He and his wife
were without money,
friends, job prospects. We
helped him, over many
months, to get his full VA
beneﬁts. And now, when
he needs us, we make
home visits.

There's nothing very
unusual about this Red
Cross story. .

It's the kind of job we do
every day. Which is why we
need your support more
than ever. Help us. Be-
cause the things we do
really help. In your own
neighborhood. And
across America./And the
world.
