 Nove|is’r, In Exchange  
For Dr. Amunclson

Dr. Carroll Amundson, Pitt’s specialist on English history, is on

this way to England to teach, lecture, and do research work at Leeds

University. Pitt gets two famous Britishers in exchange, Guy Pat-

terson Chapman, publisher and historian, and his wife, Storm Jame-

son, novelist.

Dr. Amundson, accompanied by his wife, Mrs. Grace Amundson,
sailed for England on September 17 aboard the S. S. Parthia. During
the War Dr. Amundson was a Lt. Commander on Commander Harold

Stassen’s staff in England.

of Leeds and the author of several books, will teach Recent English

eginning of Registration

Brings Headache to Registrar

A mass of irate -undergrads, reminiscent of the days of foot-
ball’s ﬂying wedge, descended upon the Registrar’s office coincident
with the start of registration last week.

Seniors, seeking rectiﬁcation of jurﬁor appointments mailed them,

‘and upperclassmen who had not

yet received their registration kits
dominated the group.
By opening time Monday morn-

ing, no semblance of order pre-

vailed. Adding to the confusion

_was the absence of ‘ventilation

since allthe doors on the floor
were closed, , « -  .
The registrar’s staff admitted a

few at _a time for the registration-

of their complaints. Numbers were
passed out at the door to foil any
tacticians who might have found
the alternative or side entrance by
which students were forced to
leave.

An unidentiﬁed student was car-

ried" away with heat. prostration
about 10. a. m., but the congestion
prevailed until late Monday after-
noon. '
' The Registrar’s staff explained
that numerous changes in address
in addition to the “late” mailing
caused the kits not _to -be received
in time.

Pitt is taking the Ellsworthﬁeld
court decision on the chin but will
try, to make the best of a crippled

Weber, secretary of the Universi-
ty’s board of trustees.

The lighting towers and under-
ground wiring, forbidden by the
court, will be removed from the
ﬁeld probably this week.

“The court’s decision certainly
crippled our intramural athletic
program,” said Dr. Weber, “but
we will show the people of. Shady-
side that we intend to abide by
the ruling. Already we have

pervision for the ﬁeld.”

(The court ruled that
on Sundays and that personsunot
connected with the University be
kept from using the field.)

Zoning Rules Cited

Egan of the Court of Common
Pleas was based on Pittsburgh’s
1923 zoning ordinance. Theor-
dinance established Shadyside as
a community ,. of ‘single-family
dwellings, churches, and libraries.
Other ediﬁces were permitted,
only if they were present before
the passage of the law, and they
were not allowed to expand their
activities. V
t The ‘effect of the ordinance" is
that Ellsworth ﬁeld, formerly

Leo C. Bemis, assistant director
of intramural sports, pointed out
that IM games will be played as
scheduled, except ‘that they will

be crowded into the daylight
hours. "
Meanwhile, Athletic Director

Frank Carver said that the legal
setback has not aﬁectedtplans to
have the Pitt freshman football

Aside from frosh practice, Dr.

was contemplating no new uses
for _Ellsworth ﬁeld at the moment.
“Actually, whatwe need is three
or -four ﬁelds,” declared Dr. Weber.
“But we cannot get them.” .

,_ When Miss Beebe Spanos meets her class in description and¢
‘N-“narration, she will bring with her memorable impressions of Oxford
University, where she studied this summer. The English viewpoint
will be uppermost in her mind,
courses in the Modern Novel and Literary Criticism, but her back-
ground of study at Pitt will not be minimized.

After ;six weeks in Europe Miss Spanos has been able to com-

because she has just completed

ment: “The courses I studied un-
der D_r. Hunt and Dr. Mayer are
much ‘more than comparable to
__the ones I took at Oxford.” A
.TovOxford’s venerable colleges
have come i England’s youthful
statesmen and students togbe nur-
tured in traditions of this school,
allegedly founded by Alfred the
fa Z Great. It was here that Miss Spa-
nos attended lectures and partici-
pated in seminars which followed.
_In comparing techniques of
study at Oxford with those at the
‘University, Miss Spanos noted that
the lecture system was "even more
impersonal than at Pitt.” Only in
the seminars--which consisted of

Bed-37761‘ ‘iz zéqwaides ‘ﬁepséni-‘SM!

ten or less people did the student
ﬁnd personal contact with the pro-
fessor. _

Men like Wesley, Shelley, and
Arnold studied behind the crum-
bling fronts of Oxford and paced
their moldering cloisters. .At Ox-
ford, where such men were schol-
ars, the lecture system became
famous. Pitt’s own system of lec-
turing is much the same. -Miss
Spanos, a graduate and teacher at
Pitt, also taught at Carnegie Tech;

such resources enabled her to

evaluate the trip in terms_of stu
dents, not studies. _ -
Miss Spanos said, “What the
student gains by studying abroad.
as compared with study at home
depends on the person himself.

The human relationship is more
than book knowledge.”

When Miss Spanos left Eng-
land she visited Paris. In speak-
ing of Paris, she said of this re-
lationship, “I went to Europe with
a former faculty member, but I
spent much time seeing the city
through, the eyes of France, not
Pittsburgh.”

Massive, semi-monastic build-

ings; the Cherwell, a tributary of
the Thames; Lady Margaret Hall

where she was served tea;
twenty-one separate _ colleges,
velvety lawn —- these are the

things that lead Miss Spanos to
conclude: “Oxford is SO beau-
tiful!” '

Miss Spanos traveled in Italy

as well as France and England,

but after studying at Oxford, she
returned to say in all sincerity,
“Only by studying abroad did I
learn to -fully appreciate Pitt.

Down in the Southwest, mean-
while, there is considerable argu-
ment raging over just how good
this 1948 SMU team really is.

One school of thought—and it
is in the minority—maintains that
the Mustangs will not repeat as
Southwestern champs because of
a thinness in line reserves.

On the other hand, at least two
national magazines have ‘picked
SMU as the top team in the na-
tion. Coach Matty Bell, they say,
rules a signle wing offense that
will slam a weak opponent right
