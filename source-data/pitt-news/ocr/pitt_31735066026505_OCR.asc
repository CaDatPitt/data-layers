Assault allegations reported

By Mark Gordon
Asst." News Editor

A Pitt student told campus
police she was sexually
assaulted early Friday morning
after leaving an Oakland bar
with a man she had just met.

No arrests have been made
by the Department of Public
Safety yet because of possible
jurisdiction questions and lack
of information from the vic-
tim.

The victim, 18, left the bar,
according to Public Safety,
with a person identified only
as “Greg.” ,

The pair went to an apart-
ment on Ward Street in South
Oakland where the alleged

SGB plans
call-in

talk show
on WPTS  

By Nathan Hughes
Staff Writer

The Student Government
Board is planning to form a
radio call-in show that would
air on the student radio sta-
tion, WPTS, on Thursday
nights sometime between the
hours of 8 and 11 o’clock.
Plans for the show have not
yet been finalized. .

The proposed show would
consist of students calling in
and voicing their complaints
regarding the university. A
member of the SGB would
then respond to these com-
plaints. "

“It would be an effective
utilization of the university
facilities to facilitate the
expression of concern by the
students to the Student
Government,” said SGB
member John Capriotti.

The topics discussed each
night would depend on the
caller. In other words, there
will not be a set topic for
each program.

“I would anticipate that
certain topics would arise as
to the nature of the show.
There will eventually be a
focus,” stated Capriotti.

The participation of the stu-
dent body will have a heavy
inﬂuence on whether or not
the show remains on the air.
The SGB, however, hopes to
keep it going for quite some
time.

“It depends on how it goes,

assault took place.

“At the apartment the victim
stated the suspect pushed her
down on the couch and

unzipped her pants and belt.

buckle,” said Rick Boyd,
director of Public Safety.

The victim pushed the sus--

pect away and told him “she
did not want to do it,” accord-
ing to Boyd. “Greg” told the
victim he had an extra bed
upstairs and she could sleep
there.

After they went upstairs,
“Greg” again unzipped her
pants and he unzipped his
pants.

He then exposed his penis
on her pubic hair, according to
Boyd.

The victim pushed him off
her, left the apartment and
began to wander around
streets in Oakland. Individuals
on Atwood Street stopped to

help her, and they called‘

Public Safety, according to
Boyd.

Boyd said because the inci-
dent did not happen on the Pitt
campus it is not in their juris-
diction.

However, the City of
Pittsburgh Police could ask
Public ‘Safety for assistance in
a possible investigation. ,

In addition, according to
Boyd, the investigation also

could be more difficult

because the victim left the bar
intoxicated.

United Faculty President
Mark Ginsburg displayed a
petition of 1,200 signatures

in favor of Pitt retaining both ,

Health America and Blue

Cross as the university’s

insurance carriers at yester-

day’s Senate Council meet-..
ing.

Senate Council’s Faculty
Assembly has in recent
months been considering
three options for filling its
future insurance needs. The
first option is to keep Health
America as a carrier with
options for new enrollments
open. The second option is

to keep Health America but

close future enrollments, and‘
the third option is to drop

Health America from the

university’s insurance cover-

age and make Blue Cross its

sole provider.

The petition showed
strong antipathy for the third

option from the 500 faculty ‘

members and 700 staff
members who signed the
document, according to
Ginsburg.

“Awarding sole-provider
status to either ‘company
would have profoundly neg-
ative__ effects for at least two
reasons,” Ginsburg said. “It
would force Pitt employees
and their families to break
long-standing relationships
with their doctors. And sec-

Program helps patients assess cancer risk I

By Linda Wisniewski
Staff Writer

Individuals who fear they may have a
hereditary increased risk of developing can-
cer can now assess this risk and what can be
done about it.

“Knowledge is better than ignorance,” said
John J. Mulvihill, the program's medical
director and professor of human genetics,
pediatrics, and molecular genetics and bio-
chemistry.

The program is sponsored by the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and
Magee-Womens’ Hospital.

The Cancer Genetics Program, announced
at the beginning of this year, is designed to

provide genetic counseling and education to
the patients, allowing them to have a sense of
control over their health and providing them
with more options and a higher probability of
early detection, as well as the possibility of a
potential cure.

“Just because a disease has genetic origins, .

doesn’t mean it’s hopeless,” said Mulvihill.

Mulvihill said in the 1970s most cancers
were thought to be caused entirely by envi-
ronmental factors, and not until recently has
it been known that cancer is a genetic dis-
ease.

“It’s actually been my research interest for
15 years,” he said. “We’ve been doing it in a
less organized way here since I arrived four

TOKYO — Toyota Motor
Corp. said yesterday that it will
cut the length of the working
day at its plants because, of
public pressure to reduce
Japan’s long working hours.

But the time will come out of
the employees’ lunch breaks.

The reduction of work hours
from 1,952 to 1,892 will not
affect production, according to
Toyota, because the lost 15
minutes will come from shorter
lunch breaks. Toyota said it had
obtained union agreement to
the changes. — Reuters

WASHINGTON — President
Clinton formally announced
Monday that he submitted bills
to Congress calling for a mid-
dle-class tax cut and an
increase in the minimum wage.

The bills will be introduced
by Democratic congressional
leaders, White House
spokesman Mike McCurry
said.

Clinton’s proposed $60 bil-
lion tax cut plan would give
Americans earning up to
$100,000 a year tax breaks to
offset child-care, home-buying,
college tuition and medical
expenses.

The wage proposal consists
of raising the hourly minimum
from $4.25 to $5.15 over two

ments. —- Reuters

years ago.”

Although genetics tests are
not yet available for all can-
cers, the Cancer Genetics
Program helps to reduce the
fear and anxiety that a family
history of cancer can create
by educating patients and
doctors on the most recent
tools of molecular genetics.

“In the last six months we
found about five different
genes,” said Mulvihill.
“Sometimes finding it means
just knowing what chromo-
some it’s on and not actually
having it on hand.”

Program Coordinator Mona
Penles Stadler said two genes
have been found that predis-
pose women to breast and
ovarian cancer, four genes
for certain types of colon
cancer and one for thyroid
cancen

“The list is growing month-
ly,” she said.

According to Mulvihill,
there has been very good
response to the program so
far.

“As of Feb. 1, we had 230
inquiries,” said Mulvihill.
“From that, a total of 43 indi-
viduals have been scheduled
to be seen even through
May.”

“We’re really here as a
consulting service,” said
Stadler. “We’re not here to
make decisions for our
patients.”

“It’s not a study,” she said.
“The primary focus of this
program is genetic counsel-
ing-cancer risk assessment
consultation.”

“That by itself is not a
study, it is not a research
endeavor,” Stadler said.
“That is a clinical service
offered by a cancer genetics
program which is jointly sup-
ported by the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center
and Magee.”

Stadler said the Pittsburgh

are also involved with the
program because they are
“under the UPMC umbrella.”

“There is a fee associated
with it — it’s $200,” she
said. “But, we feel very
strongly, too, that we’re will-
ing to work with a family
who simply cannot come up
with that amount of money.”

“The institutions are will-
ing to set up payment plans,”
said. Stadler. “So, we’re not
going to deny anyone the ser-
vice because of their inability
to pay.” _

Mulvihill said it is unpre-
dictable whether the fee is
covered by insurance or not
because it is billed as a ser-
vice.

“Some payers cover it as
good_preventative medicine,
and others say since most
centers don’t have this, obvi-

ously it’s not a standard of
care we should pay for,” he
said.

Mulvihill said that this is
one out of three places in the
nation where comprehensive
cancer genetics programs
have been launched.

People who benefit the
most from cancer risk assess-
ment are those who have
cancer occurring at an early
age — before 40 — as well
as their close relatives.
Others who would also bene-
fit include people who have
had more than one tumor in
the same organ, people with
two or more members of the
family affected by the same
kind or related cancers, peo-
ple with two or more first-
degree relatives with cancer
or people who have cancers
that are linked with rare or

   Horn -
   TRANSP

inherited diseases and birth
defects.

He said completing the
program for a patient will
probably take six months and
will require a tracing of the
family’s history of cancer.

If a family shows a signifi-
cant history of the disease,
the patient may be asked to
participate in DNA testing
which may pinpoint the gene
responsible for their bout
with cancer, as well as past
and future generations of
their family, Mulvilhill said.

“We have to be absolutely
certain what kind of cancer
we are dealing with,” said
Stadler. “It is essential to our
diagnosis.”

“When. we get to the DNA,
that is not a clinical service,”
said Stadler. “They are done
under research settings.”

“It’s not just a simple thing
of just coming in, drawing
blood and we’re going to tell
you yes or no,” she said. “It’s
still a research mechanism,
and requires having multiple
affected family members that
are willing to give us some
blood.” '

“You are really trading one
uncertainty for another,” said
Stadler. “Even though we can
tell you if you have that
gene, we are not able to tell
you when cancer will happen

' or if it will happen.”

“We sometimes run into a
dead end,” said Mulvihill.

.“Sometimes_ people don’t

want to participate because
they are in denial or they just
think it is none of our busi-
ness.”

He also said that in many

eventually to higher rates.”

Ginsburg said the petition was
distributed over a period of
about three weeks on all five
Pitt campuses mainly in areas
where the United Faculty has
members. He added that very
few people refused to sign the
petition.

Both Health America and
Blue Cross have offered plans
in which they would each be the
sole canier for university insur-
ance needs.

“The final decision, which
will probably be made some
time in March,” Ginsburg said,
“rests unilaterally with the
administration.”

Both Senate Council
President James Holland and
university Chancellor J. Dennis

the petition.

spoke about the need for more
effective and evenly applied
post-tenure review for faculty
and staff throughout the univer-
sity.

“What has always bothered us
a lot about trying to work on a
five-year post-tenured review
process was the fact that we
know we’re supposed to have,
and do have in most cases, a
pretty good policy on annual
reviews,” Holland said.

Holland said current annual -

reviews are done by checking a
tenured faculty member or
staff’s activities in the areas of
research, publications, ongoing
work, teaching and teaching
evaluations.

This policy from the Faculty
Handbook is “a very clear poli-
cy,” Holland said.

“It’s important for everyone
to realize that an annual review
is a necessity and it is also an
official policy of the university,”

mand of your life. Call 1-800-USA ARMY.

Pitt Provost James Maher said.
“It is also true that we need to
look at the policies ofvthe
schools in implementing that
university-wide policy. In some
areas of the university that
annual review may become
more visible and be somewhat a

more serious element in a facul- .

ty member’s year.” -

Holland called Maher’s com-
ments “very encouraging,” and
indicated that he was pleased to
see the administration getting
more involved in its enforce-
ment of annual review in all
university departments.

cases it is difficult or
impossible to get a certain
family member’s blood
sample because they are
deceased.

“Almost everyone who
has cancer these days has
an operation for it,” he
said.

“When there is an oper-
ation, tissue is removed.”

“Pathology departments
of large hospitals tend to
keep that material partly
for legal reasons and
partly for research,” he
said.

“Sometimes welare able
to go and get DNA right

blocks that have been

Mulvihill said that this
procedure requires the
family to sign consent

Stadler said many things
could go wrong when one
finds out that they are a

carrier of a certain gene , i

for cancer, so people
should weigh all of the
pros and cons before mak-
ing the decision to go
through with the DNA
tests.

“This could cause you
very serious psychological
problems,” she said.“You
could experience depres-
sion, you could experience
fear of the future or you
could ‘be guilty about
knowing that you have
this gene and you are
going to pass it off to your
offspring.” - . '

The program is open to
anyone, and both Stadler
and Mulvihill said it will
be a permanent program.

  Opinions

An ounce of prevention

The Republican-controlled Congress,,in its infinite wis- _.

dom, is trying to rewrite the crime bill which was passed
last year. In response, President Clinton has threatened to
veto any bill that would repeal last year’s commitment to
put 100,000 new police officers on the street. According
to The Pittsburgh-Post Gazette, the Republican rewrite of
the bill aims to collect several programs, including ‘$8
billion for hiring new police, into a single $10 billion
block grant. Anti-crime measures such as midnight bas-
ketball programs may lose funding under the new block
plan.

In his message, President Clinton only threatened to
veto the bill if the new police officer funding was in
jeopardy. He mentioned nothing about the other provi-
sions in the Republican rewrite of the crime bill, such as
increased use of illegally seized evidence.

The President should stand by his threat to veto the
crime bill if the change comes through the Congress. His
omission of the other provisions seemed to indicate to
some people that he would be willing to accept them in a
final version of the crime bill. He should use the veto
power freely here, in order to make sure that the crime
bill remains true to its original form. These measures are
likely to make their way through the House of
Representatives, but could be stopped in the Senate.

These rewrites are aimed not at solving the crime prob-
lem, but instead seek to continue the old forms in a new
way. For a party that says it wants a smaller government,
the Republican Party is sure expending plenty of effort to

-see that more people are under the direct_control of the

government and that the government has more power to
incarcerate people.

Provisions which break down the protection of the
Fourth Amendment to the Constitution should be a cause
for the president to veto this year’s feature cover crime
bi.1.l:rsIl’l-9‘ll‘?..5-.-f.‘?;*': c.rim.¢..P.r¢V¢.n..ti0n are be.ttc.r....S.P.e;I1.t.ll1?‘"

perpetrators of these crimes. Opposition to programs like
midnight basketball shows the ignorance of some legisla-
tors as to what works in other parts of the country. A rep-
resentative from a middle class Northern Californian dis-
trict, for example, is not likely to know what works on
Manhatten’s Upper West Side. One man’s solution is
another’s pork.

The president should stand firm and present these facts
to Congress. Continuing efforts to water down legislation
and returning to old forms which are ineffective must be
resisted. Efforts at both the state and federal level toward
solving crime must begin to get at the roots of the crime
problem and preventing crimes, rather than dealing with
them after they have happened. i

ell, it
h a s
taken

the wonders of
modern science

seems scientists
have finally
Columnist been able to the-
‘ Erika orize that, yes
Kendra (believe it or
not) men and women are different.
ABC recently ran an hour-long
special on the subject, highlighting
neurological, hormonal and psy-
chological tests aimed at proving
this fact.

The ABC special delved into
the controversial issue of allowing
women to take jobs they are
unable to do, simply because they
are women. The program showed
footage of a secretly-ﬁlmed video
of women trying to pass the physi-
cal test to become fire fighters.
The video clearly showed that
some of the women were unable
to lift the equipment, pick up vic-
tims or run long distances carrying
fire-fighting equipment. When
Gloria Steinem, a leading gender-
feminist, was asked what she
thought of this, her answer was:
“Lower the standards.”

Pardon me, but should stan-
dards be lowered for jobs socriti-
cal as ﬁghting ﬁres just so women
can join? By all means, if a
woman is able to pass the set stan-
dard, she should not be excluded
based on gender. But if I am
trapped in a ﬁre, I want to know
that when I am unconscious,
someone will be able to pick me
up and carry me to safety instead
of dragging me down several
ﬂights of stairs to a broken neck
and safety (such as it would be).

Along the same vein, the ABC
program considered the issue of
women in combat roles in the mil-
itary. When asked about women
not being able to pass the physical
standards required for entrance
into the military, the gender-ferni-
nist response was again “lower the
standards.” The standard, in fact,
is already ridiculously low. To
pass basic training, a woman is

decades, but it_

only required to do 13 push-ups,
10 chin-ups and run one mile
(based on the requirements two
years ago). That’s it. In the event
of an actual military conﬂict, there
isno way these meager require-
ments will be sufﬁcient. A country
does not get bonus points for ﬁeld-
ing the fairest army.

Other parts of the program
detailed the behavior of male and
female children raised in non-sex-
ual, non-gender environments.
Yet, researchers still showed that
the little boys still selected toy
guns and trucks in toy stores,
while the little girls still wanted
Barbies and baby dolls. One
mother reported that she had
bought Barbie dolls for both her
daughter and son, and her son (to
her horror) tore the box open and
used the doll as a sword.

All this proves what so many
members of the gender-feminist
movement have been trying to
deny for years. Men and women
are different. Aside from obvious
physical and anatomical differ-
ences, women and men have dif-
ferent interests, are proficient at
different things and have different
goals in life. (I realize this is a
huge generalization, and there are
always exceptions. There is noth-
ing wrong with being one of
those exceptions.)

I will not even begin to say that
men and women should not be
given the same opportunities that
life has to offer. I do not propose
that women should be forced to
stay-at-home-and-raise-the-kids.
Such an idea is draconian in prin-
ciple and offends even women,
like myself, who wretch at the
very term “feminism.” What I
propose is that an end be brought
to the rhetoric of gender-femi-
nism.

« Over the past few years I have
been told that I am not a real
woman. The reason for this is
because I do not feel it necessary
to blame my shortcomings on
men. In answer to this, I have
only to say that I was raised to
believe in taking responsibility for
my own actions. If something is

Y chromosome doesn '2‘ mean gui/Iy

outside of my reach, I either try
harder until I get it or credit my
own inability to do certain things.

I have also been‘ told that I feel
the way I do because of the fact
that I have been indoctrinated into
a masculine way of thinking by
the male-ruled hierarchy of the
education system. Answer: I pride
myself on being able to think for
myself. No one indoctrinated me
into thinking a certain way. If
anything can be be blamed for
indoctrination, consider the ability
of the gender-feminist movement
to have thousands. of women
chanting in unison, “It’s not my
fault, I’m being oppressed by
HIM.”

I want to pose this question:
doesn’t the idea of lowering stan-
dards for job requirements, solely
in the interest of allowing women
to participate, suggest that women
need special treatment in order to
compete? I always thought that
women were supposed to be
capable of anything on their own.
Asking for lowered standards
directly contradicts this belief. I
cannot understand how any self-
respecting woman would accept a
position knowing she was hired
only to be an ofﬁce showpiece. I
would like to think that I will be
hired for my qualiﬁcations and
abilities. If a woman is excluded,
it is discrimination; if a man is
excluded, it is afﬁrrnative action.
This makes no sense. Exclusion is
exclusion.

Gender-feminists expect men
to cower/in guilt because they
happened to be born with a Y-
chromosome. Quite ‘conveniently,
that y fits nicely at the end of guilt
to create “guilty” — what every
man should be considered. Like it
or not, women and men are dif-
ferent. It is time to stop claiming
oppression every time women are
unable to do something because
of female physical conﬁguration,
and to stop asking that standards
be lowered to make up for natural
differences. '

Erika Kendra is proud to be polit-
ically incorrect.

Hoo sin
Pitts ur h
tastesa of

like fish
Columnist Hey,
Ed

Pittsburgh.
Professional
basketball
has come to town, and judg-
ing by the average atten-
dance at the Pittsburgh
Piranhas’ games, nobody
seems to know.

There are more empty,
seats at a Piranhas game
than at an 8 a.m. lecture on
physics. Sure they may be
part of the Continental
Basketball Association,
where franchises close down
faster than illegal gambling
rings, but with a little imag-
ination onecan actually
have a good time at a
Piranhas game.

Here’s a little guide to
enjoying a Piranhas game
for those of you who may be
interested.

I. You have to hop on a
PAT bus and head down-
town to Duquesne
University’s A.J. Palumbo
Center. I’d prefer to call it
the “Fish Tank.”

2. You need a ticket. This
can be done minutes before
tip-off and will cost you $5.
This gets you in to the game
and is cheap enough for you
to take a date.

3. After you pass the sou-
venir tables loaded with
Piranha merchandise —
because none has been sold
all year —— you can head to
your seats (anywhere you
want to sit is fine) and begin‘
to memorize the players and
learn about the rule differ-
ences in the CBA.

Some of the players’
names are easily recogniz-
able. Such superstars as
Jarvis Basnight of
University Nevada-Las
Vegas, Brian Davis from
Duke, Jo Jo English who
played with the Chicago
Bulls in the NBA and J aren
Jackson out of Georgetown
are on the Piranhas" roster.
The Piranhas even hold the
rights to former Pitt star
Brian Shorter, who is play-
ing overseas.

The CBA rules are almost
identical to those used in the
NBA except that in the CBA
there is a seven-point sys-
tem. Division standings are
determined by points won.
A team receives three points
for winning a game and one
point for winning a quarter.
If a quarter is tied, the two
teams split the point. Also,
in the CBA, no player can
foul out. When a player
commits his seventh or

Wrestling falls again to No. 12 Clarion

By Matt Hartung
For The Pitt News

The Panther wrestling team suffered
its second consecutive setback at the
hands of a nationally ranked team, this
time losing 19-15 to l2th—ranked

  
   

Panthers to swallow. After the first six
matches, the Panthers led by a score of
15-7. But then they went into a tailspin
and dropped their last four matches.

“We let this one slide right through
our hands,” said head coach Rande
Stottlemyer. “It’s very frustrating. We

had every opportunity to beat the No. 12
team. All we had to do was win one of

those last four matches. Do you think we

could do that? No.”

The match see-sawed back and forth at

the beginning. Chris Stevens lost a deci- A

sion 6-2 to Sheldon Thomas in the 118-
pou_nd match, giving Clarion a 3-0 lead.
Pitt’s Chad Jesko knotted the score at
three by beating Jason Clark 8-6 in the
126-pound division.

Tom Tomeo beat Chris Cox 12-4 in
the 134-pound match, giving Clarion the
lead again, 7-3. Standout J.J. Fasnacht
brought Pitt within one by defeating
Jody Clark 6-4 in the l42—pound match,
and Brett Gould beat Matt Pernesky 8-7
to put the Panthers ahead 9-7. John
Withrow recorded an injury default

against Moss Grays, increasing the

Panther lead to 15-7.

The Panthers seemed to be in control
at this point, but then they self—destruct—
ed. Bryan Matusic lost 1-0 to Paul
Antonio in the 167-pound match, and
John'Gibeaut lost 6-5 to Joel Gilbert in
the 177-pound match. Mark Bodo’s 2-0
loss to Bryan Stout in the 190-pound
class put Clarion back on top, 16-15.

Up next was the heavyweight class,
where Pat Wiltanger squared off against
Dan Payne to decide the match.
Wiltanger, usually reliable for a big win,
came up short, losing by decision, 5-3.

That’s two losses by one point and two
losses by two points. Losing by so little
at the end, why does that sound so
familiar?

“I’m still spitting nails today,” said
Stottlemyer of the loss. “The thing is,
we went down standing. If you’re going
to go down, go down swinging.”

This loss comes in the wake of another
close defeat, Thursday night’s loss at

lvlth-ranked" Edinboro_.’~'Th’u:rsda'y‘ "night’ s‘ “‘

“Thursday night we did everything we

The Panthers aren’t out of the woods
just yet. They face West Virginia at the
Field House on Friday night and No. 13-
ranked Penn State at Chartiers Valley
High §phool Saturday night —' two
teams that can give the Panthers some
trouble.

“We want to recover from this before

Friday,” said Stottlemyer. “We don’t
want to forget that this happened, but we
do want to put it behind us.”

Women's gymnastics upended by Temple   8

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

 

The Pitt women’s gymnas-
tics team traveled to
Philadelphia for a meet
against Temple University
this past weekend and lost by
a score of 183.125 to 180.70.

“It was disappointing,”
head coach Debbie Yohman
said. “We saw a Temple team
that we could have beaten.
We had a good week of prac-
tice, so we are disappointed
right now.”

In the all—around competi-
tion, Pitt placed two gym-
nasts in the top three. Junior
Brenda Stevens finished sec-
ond with a score of 36.975,

and sophomore Robyn
Senior (36.30) took third
place.

Pitt’s first event of the
competition was the uneven
bars. Stevens showed the

way with a 9.425. This score
placed third on the event.
Senior scored a 9.125 for the
Lady Panthers on this appa-
ratus.

The vault was next for Pitt.
Senior took second in the
competition, scoring a 9.45.
Michaelene Myers followed
her teammate, taking third
with a 9.20. Other scores for
the Lady Panthers were
Christine Battista’s 9.05 and
Stevens’ 9.0.

“Robyn did a super job,”
Yohman said.

The third event of the day
for Pitt was the floor exer-
cise. Senior scored a 9.55 to
take top honors in this event.
Lori Buck (9.30), Calli
Bodnar (9.25) and Stevens
(9.05) followed along behind
Senior.

“Brenda had a very good
meet,” Yohman said, “even
though her ﬂoor routine was

watered down.”

The Lady Panthers next
went to the balance beam,
their final apparatus of the
day. Stevens continued her
fine work with a 9.5, good
for second in the meet.
Freshman Kristin Bond
scored a 9.2 in the lead-off
spot for Pitt. However, her
teammates did not follow the
trend. Deena Daller (8.8) and
Buck (8.95) had fair rou-
tines. Senior (8.3) and Myers
(8.85) suffered falls from the
beam.

“Right now we just have a
lack of confidence,” Yohman
said. “We need to get the fire
back.”

This season has been a tale
of two teams for Yohman
and the Lady Panthers.
Stevens, Senior and Myers
have led the way, but the rest
of the team has been incon-

sistent at best.

“We need to have good
meets from Robyn [Senior],
Mikey [Myers] and Brenda
[Stevens],” Yohman said-
“But three people do not
make a team. The rest of the
team just needs solid scores.”

This Saturday Pitt takes on
Indiana University of
Pennsylvania. IUP is known
to be a weaker team than Pitt,
so the Lady Panthers could
have a chance to get their
confidence back to where
Yohman thinks that it
belongs.

“There will be shake-ups in

the lineup this week,”
Yohman said. “We are going
to kick some butt in the gym
this week.”
Flips and flops: Pitt hosts
IUP on -Saturday afternoon at
l p.m. at Trees Hall. It will
be a combined meet, as the
Pitt women’s and men’s
teams will compete together.

Men '5 gymnastics team oufmusc/ed

By Brad Isles
Staff Writer

It was a tough weekend for
the Pitt men’s gymnastics
team. as it travelled to Ohio
State and was defeated
226.75 to 215.2.

Head coach Frank
D’Amico felt that a meet
against the No. 2-ranked
Buckeyes would be benefi-
cial for the team.

“It wasn’t about winning
or losing,” said D’Amico.
‘‘It was about our kids being
exposed to a different kind
of pressure.”

Once again leading the
way for the Panthers was
junior Jason Lannie. In the
all-around he scored a

53.35. highlighted by a 9.35
on the still rings. This was
only enough to finish second
behind the Buckeyes’ Rod
Gendron, who placed first
with a 55.55.

Being in a different gym
was another reason why
D’Amico felt his team
would benefit. He said that
the judging was difficult,
which kept the scores down,
and the gymnasts had to
work for every 10th of their
score. Also being exposed to
a foreign environment
helped to get them ready for
the more important away
meets later in the season,
such as the ECACS and
National Independent
Championships.

‘‘In order to become suc-
cessful, you need to be able
to adapt in strange familiari-
ties,” D’Amico said.

The floor exercise was the
team’s top event, with four
gymnasts scoring over 9.0.
They totaled a 36.65. Brian
Narvaez led the way with a
9.4, followed by Andy
Anderson who had a 9.15.
Both Lannie and Scott
Carslaw scored 9.05.

Pitt also totalled a 36.65
on the high bar. Karl Chan
was tied for second overall
with a 9.45. Behind him
were Chris Sweeten with a
9.2, Lannie with a 9.05 and
Carslaw with 8.95.

In all but one event, the
Panthers found themselves

looking up at Ohio State’s
top gymnast, Blaine Wilson.
D’Amico feels Wilson has
what it takes to be an
Olympian. On the night he
consistently scored in the
high nines. He scored a 9.9
on rings and 9.8 on the
floor, followed by 9.70 on
horse and 9.65 on both high
bar and parallel bars. He did
not compete on vault.

For Pitt, Keith Youndt
remained solid on his
events. On rings he tied a
personal best at 9.5. He was
followed by Lannie who
scored a 9.35 and Brian
Narvaez with a 9.0.

On parallel bars Youndt
tied another career high with
a 9.4, finishing thirdoverall.

He also led the team with a
9.25 on pommel horse. And
on vault he tied for third
overall with a 9.0.

Also on vault, Narvaez
finished second behind
OSU’S Neil Niemi (9.45),
scoring a 9.1.

“I thought it would be a
good experience for our
guys,” D’Amico said. “I

sure.

“In our respects it was

more foul, the other team
receives one extra free
throw.

4. After you have accom-
plished all of this pre-game

‘hoopla, sit back and prepare

to laugh. The game
announcer thinks that he

belongs on ESPN, when in .

fact he couldn’t do the
sports on “Sesame Street.”
The players belong in

professional wrestling
instead of basketball. Each
player feels that he belongs
in the NBA and lets every-
one else know about it. In .
reality, not one player on
the Piranhas is ever likely

, to see a NBA game unless

they buy a ticket.

5. If you get to shoot a
three quarters length of the
court shot to win a car, as
this writer got to do, do not -
shoot an air ball because
even Piranha fans know
how to boo.

In conclusion, if you like ’
to watch basketball and Pitt
hoops has you fed up with
the college game, and you
don’t mind" spending $5,
then go to a Piranhas game
now because the team will
probably not be back in
Pittsburgh for another sea-
son after this disappointing
one. ‘
