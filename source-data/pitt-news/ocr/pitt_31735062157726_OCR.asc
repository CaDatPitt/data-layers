1’ .. It seems that several men from
g"bo_th Tech and Pitt have bought
§_'.so-called cashmere jackets from
‘5j'roaming solicitors in autos and
trucks around the local campuses
and fraternity districts.
 "The salesmen of all “ages and
descriptions, would pull along-
‘, side a student or several’ students
and tell a big story about ,a load
of jackets on which the order had
been cancelled or a similiar line.
As told by several men of the Pitt
1 News staff who had been - ap-
‘ proached by these salesmen, the
"men would stop them, show them
some apparently expensive cash-
mere sport jacket and offer them
atlow prices. ‘

In trying -to convince their pros-
pects ‘they would pull out sales
and inventory papers to prove
that it was all legal. The Pitt
News men didn't buy, but other
students who did would receive
a‘ box containing a jacket from
the salesmen. _

-The salesmen then zoomed
away and the gleeful student

3- would open the box a_nd-_ﬂ_n‘d, to
his chagrin, the sleezy imitation,
' not the cashmerejob. Beware!

WISC-A, Commission Changes

Meeting Time Raise Interest

First WSGA Commission meet-
ing of the term gets underway
Thursday afternoon afternoon at
12:30 in the Braun Room on the
twelfth floor. Headlining the agen-
da is- discussion about publicity
policies of the University. -

Prior to this time, commission

meetings of WSGA were held in
the evening once a_month during
the academic year.‘ President Gin-
ny Reynolds reports that the time
was changed to make the get-to-
gethers more convenient.
. It is the opinion of the WSGA
executive committee that by
scheduling the" meetings during
the day there will be a healthier
attendance than has been realized
so far this year.

-to introduce new men,'to Pitt ac-

tivities-_ and personalities and to
help them become acquainted with
each other.’ Weekly meetings are
held on Thursday, ﬁfth hour in
room 324 C1.

An introductory -program has

been scheduled for the first four
meetings which includes a talk by
Dr. H..,C. Carlson, a music session
featuring outstanding members of
the University’s choral groups, and

the movies of last year’s Pitt-Penn,"

State football game.

‘ Club officers are still to be cho-
sen, and activities’ for the re-
mainder of the year will be
planned by incoming members to
meet their interests. Freshmen
are invited to join the club and
organize it to suit themselves.
Membership is limited to ﬁrst year
men, but upperclassmen may at-
tend any meeting that_ interests
them. ‘ ‘

/

Commission is the melting pot
for women students, so far as stu-

dent, , government is concerned.
Theoretically, each women’s or-
ganization on campus sends an
elected representative to the
meetings mostly to set and ap-
prove policy for the women’s gov-
erning group.

Women named to the post of
representatives attend the month-
ly meetings, and carry" the
thought of their group ‘to the con-
ference about matters pertaining
to women.

In the offing for women is the

Direct Student Grants

~ May Improve Policy‘

I New York, N. Y.--(I—.P.)—The awarding of federal grants to
individual students rather than to colleges and universities might
forestall the possibility of governmental control of higher education,
William B. Baer, dean of the New York University College of Arts
and Pure Science, declared here recently. A

 Conceding the “merit” of the proposals for federal aid to the
nation’s colleges and universities, Dean Baer suggested, ‘however,

Music Notes

By ALLAN srrrnrr

BON VOYAGE .' . .

Pitt music fans will have the opportunity
on Feb. 22 at Syria Mosque to take a trip
into the dominion of Jazz, the provinces of
Be-Bop and Progressive Jazz. At the present
time the two domains are ruled by Dizzy Gil-
lespie and Stan Kenton respectively. A threat
to the thrones of these two gentlemen is Mr.
Woodrow Herman, better kn-own to his follow-
ers as Woody. .

Woody’s concert tour is to prove to the
public that he has the power to take over in
these two realms his appearance here on Wash-
ington’s birthday will give local fans the op-
portunity to judge his powers.

As sort of a preview I suggest you listen
to two records recently made by Mr. Herman
and his Herd (another word for band).
Wootly’s potentialities are well deﬁned in “The
Goof and I” in the words of the noted Be-
Bop enthusiast, Algernon Namreib, this‘ rec-
ord is, “Crazy, man—Real Gone.” Reverse
side is a beautiful trombone solo, played and
written by Bill Harris. It is -titled “Every-
where.” The other record is “Lemon Drop”
featuring a chorus in a bop vocal,‘ Flipover

is a blues number, “I Ain’t Gonna ‘Wait Too

Long,” featuring Woody on the vocal.

Some of the more well known Herman per-
sonnel who will be on hand for the concert_wi1l

be’ Serge Ghaloff, baritone sax; Chubby Jack- I

son, bass; Bill Harris, trombone; Terry Gibbs,

Vibraphone and Mary Ann McCall. on vocals.‘
Now for people who really want their

money’s Worth the concert is going to have

another feature attraction, this beingthe popu--
lar King Cole trio. I doubt if much hastobe ,

said about the illustrious Nate Cole but men-

Once,” two ballads, is the trios latest release
Being released this week is an album featur
ing Nat’s piano playing. It’s called “Nat ‘King
Cole at the Piano.” It includes “Cole Cap
ers” “These Foolish Things,” “Three Littl
\Vords,” “I’ll Never Be the Same,” “H01
High the Moon,” and “Blues in l\~I_v‘ Show
er.” .

Victor .deSabata. who went over so big wit.

Symphony has signed a contract to direct sir
weeks during the 1949-50 season. He will ‘ope;
the season on Nov. 4, 1949 and remain',,i:'o
four weeks and then return in early April 0
1950 fora two week period. .

To, the long list of long-playing record

‘ you can add one more type. It is a 7 inch dis

Kenton Plays 'Encores'

Stan Kenton hascome up with terriiﬁca

bum numberthree. It’s called “Encore'.s.”; Th
album is’ really unique in that it contains -Kei
ton originals and such popular numbers. §
“Peg 0’ My Heart” and “He’s Funny Th:
Way.” The Kenton treatment of these_ is inotl
ing”sho_r.t of amazing. “Chorale for Brass,‘ Pi‘
no and Bongos” is interesting but tendsgi
become borin_g toward the end. “Abstractio"

   

and “Capital Punishment” are in'~.the_i1su‘

Kenton mood, the latter -beingthe better’

the two.  . __

Despite assertions that special-
ized training is of greater impor-
tance in modern life, he declared.
the characteristics of the liberal

“Experiments have been intro-
duced, innovations have been at-
tempted, changes have been made,
many of them successfully and
therefore permanent. But basic-
ally, despite dark predictions dur-
ing the-recent war, the curriculum
of liberal arts_ colleges has been
altered very ‘little, the primary
purpose, really not at all.”

Dean Baer expressed for “the
gradual passing” of. the veteran
student. He credited. the large

veteran enrollment with ‘the im-

provement in scholarship in most
of the nation’s institutions of
higher education.

He said that the number of stu-
dents who were graduated from

the University College with Latin‘

honors and on the Phi Beta Kappa
list during the past academic year
was one of the largest in the Col-
lege’s history.

of “grinding out” students which
several large institutions of learn-’
ing employ, Dr. D. Elton ‘True-
blood, professor of philosophy at
Earlham College and chairman of
the Friends World Committee on

Speaking recently at Wilming-

‘Building for a Better Tomorrow,”
Dr. Trueblood said_“We have fall-
en into the fallacy of praising big-
ness in educational institutions.

“Size is no measure of great-

fellowship must extend to all
parts or the size of the college
must ‘be limited.”

.‘‘everything I get th_e feeling

who is going to paint a fresco
nial, friendly man who paints
to paint.”

, He is a 1912 graduate of the University of Bologna (Italy)
‘and is today one-of the great painters of Italy and the world.
_, Mr. Romagnoli was ﬁrst interested in painting nudes and
still life studies. His ﬁrst “ﬁrst prize” he received in 1917 for
?a still, life “Object In A Dinner Room.” Since then he has
won many prizes in Italian and international exhibitions.

' VH9 did no painting during the fascist regime because “I

don ’t feel so happy about painting.” Politics then, as now, did

not interest him.

‘J The ‘artist’s deﬁnition for art is
a simple, effective one. “For me,
painting is translation ' of my"
thoughts, my feelings, in form and
color, reproducing them with
harmony and lyrical expression.”

pils should have a free choice of
the painter he wishes to study un-
der. “I.l-ike to develop the per-
sonality of each of my pupils,” he

_ says, “I try to understand them.”

His pupils, he ﬁnds, have much
inore serious feeling for painting

By BILL SCRIVO

Take an elevator to the tweny-
‘sixth ﬂoor, walk down to the
twenty-ﬁfth ﬂoor and there you
ﬁnd the oﬁ‘ice of one of the most
3 ‘important men in the business
/division of the University of Pitts-
burgh. . _

He is Walter H. Stryker, BA27,
‘ purchasing agent for the Univer-
sity, over whose signature all pur-5
chases are transacted (except
‘ bookstore and food services.)

Mr. Stryker, a wavy—haired
man with glasses, came back to
Pitt as purchasing agent in 1946
._ after working at a variety of oc-

3_cupatio'ns. «Among these were civil
"Tfservice representative, insurance,
’ and 15 years of sales and pur-
'd.,chasi_dng. ‘with various industrial
ﬁrms.

9' While still a student ‘at Pitt, Mr.
Stryker purchased books for the
"old. bookstore on O’Hara street
_, and’ managed the evening‘ school

'- __in-- the Chamber of Commerce
‘building.

“Purchasing for Pitt is more in-
'» terestirig than industrial purchas-
ing, because everything is bought
at. one time or another,” says Mr.
. -Stryker. v_v
' . ’ And when the man says “every-
thing,” that’s exactly what he

means. For instance he was once
called upon to procure 1800 mon-
keys. Another order was for stain-
less steel screws to be used in the
cyclotron. There might be any-
thing from a special ‘centrifuge
costing thousands of dollars to a
special label costing ﬁfty cents,
Mr. Stryker probably wouldn’t
be surprised to ﬁnd a requisiton
for a white elephant on his desk.
Also included in the duties‘ of

/the purchasing agent are pur-

chases made from funds given by
individuals or foundations which
are earmarked for__certain jobs.
Most prominent among these at

present is, of course, the Mellon,

grant.

Pleasant—looking Mr Stryker
ﬁnds a lot unusual about his work.
“The very nature of the Cathe-
dral makes it unusual,” he dis-
closes. “Everything in the build-
ing is of the best quality it is pos-
sible to obtain.”

The nationality rooms presented
quite a ‘problem. The materials
used in their construction .were
hard to ﬁnd. Often they had to be
made specially for the job.

Being purchasing agent for Pitt
has its compensations." One of
these is the school’s location in a

are easily obtained. Mr. Stryker
buys from local sources whenever
possible.

“We are very fortunate because
of this proximity to supplies,” says
Mr. Stryker. “Many schools are
located in places which makes
long term orders a necessity.”

Mr.‘ Stryker still has problems
which many people had not so
long ago. He is stillvfaced with
shortages in some items. At the
head of this list he puts anything
fabricated from steel and pipe.

“All the service oﬁices of the
University have today more work
than they can take care of,” Mr.
Stryker ‘points out." He attributes

. this to a “backlog of needed things

from ‘war years plus overcrowded
conditons.” " '
With the current expansion pro-
gram becoming a, reality at Pitt.
it appears that Mr. Str-yker will
be very busy‘ in the future also.

Freshmen Approvelchangesil

 

In Class Counselor Plan -   

Beginning freshmen have re-
sponded favorably to the new
upperclass counselor plan, ac-
cording to Edwin J. Mclntosh, as-
sistant dean of men. 0 '

Designed to give increased aid
to confused freshmen, the new
plan provides one counselor for
every ﬁve or six students. For-
merly, there was only one coun-
selor for every 30 students.

The plan provides each fresh-
man with an older and more ex-
perienced student to act as a
friend and guide in learning the
traditions and customs of the Uni-
versity, and the various phases of
student life.

According to a survey conduct-
ed by Bowling Green University,
615 to 70 per cent of "failures in

college result, . not from lack ‘of.’

time or mental capacity, butvfrom
a. wrong attitude.

The new plant”
attempts to remedy this situation.‘

According to Mr. Mclntosh:
“Some freshmen were reluctant
to participate in the former plan
because they could see no value
in it. Now, however, I believe
the freshmen will co-operate‘,
realizing how much the new plan
will help them in their college.
career.”

The new plan includes seven
weekly meetings of each coun-
selor group, at which’ the fresh-
will tour the campus, learn the
school songs and cheers, ‘and, dis?-
cuss activity problems. 0

They‘ tell interviewers that they think such_

on every dollar of income, as

Take Aluminum Company of America in
1947, for example. Out of each dollar re-
ceived last year by Alcoa and its subsidiaries,
the net proﬁt amounted to less than eight

Defeat Would

By MYRQN KOPELMAN

One night’s work can turn
the current basketball season
into a success for the Pitt Pan-
thers. A win over “last Vir-
ginia Wccliiesday night at the

toward erasing the memories of
the calamitous western tour.

Mountaineer fans havealways
demanded "that their team “pour
it-on” _when it plays Pitt," and an
[arch rivalry has resulted. ‘

Coast League
Race Toss-up

Playoff berths in the Coast
league were still a toss-up after
Thursday’s games at Trees Gym.

Still undefeated were the In-
dians and the Pioneers, while the
Pharmacy remained right at their
heels with a single loss.

Forfeits by the Locals and Block
H gave" the Indians and the Phar-
macy their wins. But the Pioneers
had to play four quarters before
beating Ellsworth, YMCA, 25-14.

Bob Bestwick led the Pioneer
attack. Not only did he top the
scorers with 13 points, but he al-
so controlled both backboards and
played brilliantly on defense. Jack
Zornan was high man for the
loosers with 6.

due next week when the Pioneers

And a week later it will be the
Indians and the Pioneers going at

By that time, the two playoff
positions should be decided unless

happen. In fact, it could even be
a three—Vvay tie.

Something new has been added to intramural sports.

New, shiny trophies have been purchased by Leo C. Bemis,
head of the IM otﬁce, for individual presentation to the IM cham-

pions.

Each member of the winning
team will receive a trophy. The
cups, which stand approximately
ﬁve inches high, are mounted on
a walnut—stained platform. There
is room on each for a inscribed-
gold nameplate.

These trophies will take the
place of medals used in previous
years. Now, the second-place
teams will receive gold medals.

Bemis, who is enthused over
the trophies, states that Pitt is the
only school that he knows of that
gives individual trophies to a (win-
ning team. In most schools tro-
phies are only given to a team as
a whole. A -

Not only. can ‘a participant win
a trophy as a member of a team,
but also on his individual merits.

There are awards for the most
skilled foul shot, the best golfer,
the best tennis player, along with
trophies’ for swimming and track
winners.

There has even been one bought
for skiing, if the weather permits
the snow skimming sport to be
placed on the IM program.

Team sports include volleyball,

them.

Hear Mexican Talks

Ways of studying and travel-
ling in Mexico will be discussed,
and colored ﬁlms shown, at a talk
given tomorrow in Room 324 at
4:30 p. m.

This is the second in a series of
programs sponsored by the Uni-
versity’s Committee on Educa-

tional Exchange, designed to pre-

sent Pitt students with the details
of summer study opportunities in
foreign countries.

The series, started last semes-
ter, had to suspend during mid-
term vacation but is resuming
now on aweekly basis.

At tomorrow’s talk, Virginia"

I-leidenkamp, assistant to Mrs.
Ruth Crawford Mitchell of the
Commitee on Educational Ex-
change, will describe the various

Mexican summer schools offering

courses for American students
this year.

She will also cover the relief
organizations which send groups
into Mexico. The major part of
her talk, however, will deal with
the particular international youth
organization with which she spent
two years—one in Mexico, and in
Spain. The ﬁlms were taken, by

that organization during one” of

their summers in Mexico.
