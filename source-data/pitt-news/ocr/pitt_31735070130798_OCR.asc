probably never actually .went. A stag-

workload, coupled with the burden‘-of

"deciding what to do withthe rest of

‘your life and the pressures of living
away from home for the first time,
can weigh heavily on any student.
, And sometimes the force of these
combined pressures, can drive a stu-
dent into depression.’

The Counseling Center is coordi-

nating a depression screening today"
from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the ground

ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union..
Teddy, Falkes, a counselor at

Pitt’s Counseling Center, knows it

Suicide, said Falkes, is the leading
‘ cause of death among people of ages

15 to 2,4, totaling more than 5,000

deaths in the United States alone.

every year. In at 1999 survey, 30.7

’ percent of Pitt undergraduates report-

ed symptoms of depression.
“Depression is most likely to first
occur during a major life transition,”

F~alkes7said._"‘There’s a myriad of
issues caught up in depression such

as _searching for identity and fear of
how peers View you, issues every, stu-
dent goes through in college.”

The most common symptoms of
clinical depression among college
students include lack of concentra-

tion and motivation, inability to make
decisions, loss of appetite and major
V changes in sleep patterns either

involving sleeping too much or too
little. ' . $

The. ‘difference, according, to

Fa1kes,_between. simply having a bad, 9
day or week and a major ‘depression

is the intensity and duratio of the
negative feelings.‘

T “For many, it feels like an inabil-
-ity to keep up with the gang,”- he said. .

“These persistent and intense feelings

get in the way of ‘academic success.”

Falkes _ added that the depression
screening presents an easy» chance for

students to "learn about depression

and get help if they think they need it.
Students will watch a s'hort,.film about

Moxon A

back pain could be causing her headaches
if something was out of line in her back,
so she decided to go to a chiropractor,
with hopes that he could cure both her
back and headaches.

“My back felt great,” she said. “But I
still had the headaches.”

In early June, she decided to go to her
family doctor about the headaches, which,
after all that time, had continued. She was
seen by a nurse practitioner who said her
problems were “probably allergies” and

FROM PAGE 2

gave her a prescription for the allergy .

medicine Claritin. The practitioner looked
in her eyes and ears, but never performed
any blood work or other tests.

Moxon had difficulty believing her
problem stemmed from allergies.

“But what was I allergic to?” she said.
“No one could tell me what I was allergic
to.”

The Claritin made Moxon extremely
nauseous, causing her to_ throw up con-
stantly without much warning. Her doctor
wrote her a prescription for a different
allergypill, Allegra, concluding she was
allergic to the Claritin. ‘ .

But her body’s response to the new
drug was exactly the same as it had been
for the Claritin.

“By this time I knew it wasn’t aller-
gies,” she said. i I

Toward the end of June, .Moxon
began seeing a different chiropractor. This
time, one who also specialized in nutri-

tion. She was still desperately searching
for a cause of her continuous headache.

“At that point I thought I might be
lacking something in my diet,” Moxon
said. _

Even while visiting friends in Penn
State, she was too miserable to enjoy her
time there.

“Everyone went to a party one night,” .

Moxon explained. “My headache was so
bad that I stayed in and slept.”

Then while driving home on July 2,
Moxon’s headache began to worsen. B

As soon as she stepped out of her car,
she collapsed from thepain. .

She didn’t black out, but the pain was
excruciating. She managed to crawl into
the house where she ﬁnally agreed with

her parents; she needed to go to the emer-

gency room.
In the ER, the doctor ordered a CT
scan_ to see if Moxon had brain tumors.

“Before her, no doctor had referred
me to get one, or even mentioned I might
need to have one done,” Moxon said.

“When the emergency room doctor
returned with the results of the CT scan,
she told Moxon and her family that there
was a sizeable mass on her brain. She
referred Moxon to a neurologist.

“While we were__still in the ER, my
mom was extremely upset,” she said. “But
I knew [the tumor] wasn’t cancer. Nothing
bad had ever happened to me, so why
would it now? I didn’t cry,vI just sat there.”

_Actually, Moxon said she .was

relieved to know that something really
was wrong. Numerous doctors had told’

her that because of her hypochondriasis, it
was “all in her head.” W

“Closure,” Moxon said. “That’s all I
felt. I finally knew what [my problem]
was.”

Three days later, upon the visit to the ’

neurologist, an MRI conﬁrmed she had a
grapefruit—sized tumor compressing her
brain.
A The MRI showed the tumor was
benign and after further tests, a doctor said
it ‘had probably been - growing for nearly
10 years. He was amazed that Moxon had
functioned normally for so long.

He thought it was a miracle that she
was ‘walking’, going to school and receiv-'
ing good grades, working daily without
having any seizures. ‘ i

The neurologist quickly determined
that a tumor of that size couldn’t beleft
compressing her brain and was too large
to be reduced with radiation. So Moxon
was scheduled for surgery on July 14. V

To prepare Moxon for the upcoming
surgery, she was put on steroids to reduce
_the swelling of the tumor and anti—conVul—
sants to prevent seizures during and after
the procedure. » V — ,

Three days »before the brain surgery,
she had a routine angiogram, which was
supposed to cut off the blood supply to the
tumor and shrink it before the operation,
reducing the possibility that she could lose
function on the right side of her body dur-
ing surgery. _ - _

. “I was laying on the table [during the
angiogram] with only local anesthesia in
my right leg,” Moxon explained. “I was

  

  cI.AssoI= 2001

looking around when all of a sudden it felt 
like a light turned off in my left eye. My _.
vision faded out. I blinked once or twice, 

but the light never came back on.” .

A What Moxon didn’t yet realize was
the tumor was attached to a blood vessel
that ranto her eye, and some of the chem-
icals that were to kill the tumor had
reached her eye, blinding her and thrust-

felt.

“The pain began almost immediately 

:1.

ing her into the worst pain she had ever ,-

after the lights went and it was 10 times 
worse than any of my other headaches,” 
Moxon said. “Basically, I started ﬂipping 
out and screaming at the doctors. They 
brought ice [to ease the pain.] But the pain . 2.

them.”

was so intense I had trouble responding to 

Doctors soon learned that while the 

angiogram procedure killed the tumor, it 

quickly began to expand instead of shrink.
It took hours for,Moxon’s pain -to
diminish. p , —
“The room was so cold and I was

holding my head [above theleft eye]. The, 
nurse had a cold rag on my head,” Moxon 

explained. ‘Everything was hazy and the
room was so quiet.” ' .

That was the last thing Moxon could 

remember — she was nearly comatose.
Somberdoctors told Moxon’s parents

that while the tumor forced Moxon into

emergency surgery, no matter what the
outcome, she would be permanently blind
in her left eye. ' '

Read tomorrow for the conclusion to

Moxon is story.

rently staffs more than a dozen coun-
selors and interns. Last year, the cen-
ter served more than 2,000 students.
Falkes said of that number, approxi-
mately one—third were treated for
symptoms of depression.

The depression screening will
also provide assistance to friends of
potentially depressed students who
do not seek help for themselves.
Counselors will discuss ways to help
a person recognize his or her depres-

“We can’t physically drag a per-
son into counseling or the screening,”

Falkes said. “But often a gentle-

nudge from people who care about
them will be enough for a depressed
person to get help.” , .

“It’s important to recognize the
signs. of depression and get help to fix
them,” Falkes said. “Depression is
one of the most dangerous conditions
but it’s also one of the most easily
treatable.”

The Counseling Center reports
that symptoms of clinical depression
include: ~ .

0 Persistent, sad, anxious or “empty”
feelings ' ‘
- ‘Feelings of hopelessness, pes-

 

 

simism, guilt, helplessness and
worthlessness

- Loss of interest or pleasure in usual
activities, ranging .from schoolwork

- Sleeping too much or too little

- Changes in appetite ._

- Decreased energy, fatigue, and feel-
ing slowed down

- Increased restlessness and irritabili-
ty , ‘

- Difficulty concentrating, remember-

Bill Laboon, the Libertarian representa— _

tive spoke next. Laboon said that
Libertarians are America’s third-largest
party. He outlined the party’s platform, say-
ing Libertarians stand for a government that
greatly respects citizens’ rights and that does
not regulate what people want to do with
their own bodies. He focused on the need to
reduce taxes, downsize the government and
abolish victimless crimes‘. a
Libertarian candidate Harry Brown
believes in the elimination of gun control

_ and income tax as well asthe war on drugs. '
Brown plans to fully privatize Social

Security and force America to “stop policing
the world,” said Laboon. ,

The Green party spoke next. Paul
Cooley strove to explain the growing divide
between the rich and the poor. Illustrating
this point, he said that the difference in

wages per hour between entry level workers .

and CEOS was $40 in the 19803. As of 1998
the difference reached $418. Several audi-
enoe members -responded with applause.
Cooley painted a grim image of multina-
tional corporations having too much control
in the world and over the government. ,
7‘Proﬁt and free market have become
more  than humanity,” Cooley
said. —
Ralph Nader, the Green party candi-
date, believes corporations should take more
responsibility, morally and environmentally.

Cooley also explained the need for universal a
health coverage and the abolition of the .
death penalty. ' A '

The , Democratic representatives
Brendan Harris, Stephanie Strazisar and

Rogette Hanis spoke last. Brendan Harris .

listed Vice PresidentAl _Gore’s plans regard-
ing education, including ways to encourage
more young people to go to school and col-
lege, and to stay there. Rogette Harris spoke
about aﬂirrnative action and how its policy
should, be to. “mend it, not end it.” She
explained Gore’s stance is to “make the
playing ﬁeld" open for everyone who is qual-
iﬁed,” and to do this through afﬁrmative

action. Strazisar said the Democrats work i
for abortion and ‘women’s issues, and ‘

against hate crimes. ' ' '
After the ‘speakers, the ﬂoor was ope

"for a question and answer session held with

the audience of about 100 people. Many had

'_ questions, and Dr. Anise had to end the ses- .

sion before all questions could be unan-
swered .. /

After watching the energized discus— '

sion, freshman Julie Moreah was happy that
students heard stances of the two major
political parties as well as ﬂie Libertarians
and the Greens. - C .
“Hopefully this will get students enthu-
siastic about going to ‘ the polls in

' - November,” she said.

Republican representative Corns said,

“I thought it was an excellent event,” and he i

hopes the audience agreed and understood.

Laboon, the-Libertarian speaker, said, “I
was amazed at the t11rnouL.I’m glad we have
such a politically active campus.”

against each other?

Let ﬂie truth be told - we are ﬁghting
because the majority has the pie and is only giv-
ing out one slice for all of us .to share. -

Give us our own pie! The disunity-among us
is partly our own fault but the University and its

, administrative henchmen reap the greatest reward

from it. We cannot ﬁght a common enemy if

4% we aren’t united.

Black people on this campus must real-
ize we have a common bond — we are
family — and build upon it We should
celebrate the beauty of black culture and
force the University to acknowledge the
- wonders and splendor ” of it. Our unity
would enhance our [ situation and defeat those
whojry to prevent us ﬁorn doing so.

Whether we are able to form that level of
unity or not, I will press forward with other forms
of resistance. The time has come to challenge the
administration. They need to make some serious
changes in the University’s policies conceming
black students. I am not saying rush to the chan-
cellor’s ofﬁce, not yet Make them talk and listen
to us. Ifthey are making great progress, then we
should see it Ifthey aren’t, then let’s change those
policies.

However, they must explain the lack of black
faculty, the lack of any visible commitment to
black student retention, and the horrid social
atmosphere the University provides for black stu-
dents.

Our situation is not terrible, but students, not
the administration, undated many of the positives.
The administration is doing a good job of getting
us to come to Pitt, but what about making us feel
like we made the right decision coming here? As
a former student said, “I now know what it feels
like not to be wan .” H

How long do we watch, as the University
laughs at our apathy, and wait for those who care
to graduate so they can continue their own ver-
sion of educational genocide? ~

Tnuksnnr, OCTOBER 5, 2000

We need to preserve the heart of Pittsburgh

Every once in a while, an idea
comes along that unites a popula-
tion. Sometimes it is an idea so hor-
rendously and unbelievably bad that
everyone should be united in oppo-
sition to it. Mayor Tom Murphy’s
Fifth and Forbes -project is exactly
this kind of idea.

It doesn’t matter whether you
are Republican, Democrat,
Libertarian, Green or Independent,
the question in this case is simply
about justice, for that concept is the
first casualty of Mad Murphy’s
plan. ’

Allow me to inform you a bit
about what’s happening. When you
follow Fifth or Forbes avenues from

Sold as a mp onty! S+uden+s7p

campus into Downtown, you come

across the most vibrant economic

area of the city — an area that con-

tainsmany successful and unique.

small businesses.

Murphy, ‘however,
plans to raze these M|cHAE|_
innocent establish-

ments and pay millions
of dollars, which our
bankrupt city doesn’t _ .
have, to huge corporations in order
to have the “honor” of placing their
chains in our Downtown area. The
plan will give the heart of
Pittsburgh the character of a subur-
ban mall. ’ .

As I see it, there are three main

KoRNs

 

reasons to oppose this plan. First, it
is a most despicable form of corpo-
rate welfare,lone that steals money

from ,a-dying city and gives-it to_

bloated corporations. Secondly,-it is
monumentally
destroy successful entrepre-
neurs by eminent domain, a
law designed to allow the
government to claim prop-
erty for important things
such as highways. Finally,’ the plan
is just plain dumb, as we can never
stimulate an economy by taxing the
citizens to death and then’ paying
corporations to open up shop. This
plan should be dead in the water,

but of course in Pittsburgh politics,

anything ispossible, no matter how

ludicrous it is. I I
Murphy’s plan consists of noth-

ing but corporate welfare, some-

thing that is more damaging to gov-
-_ernment and its citizens than indi-
vidual welfare, because it has all of _

individual we1fare’s . draining
effects without the corresponding
humanitarian benefits. ‘

‘Fighting corporate welfare, a
crusade in itself, is even more criti-
cal when the money being /used is
money the government cannot

afford tospend. Unlike the federal‘

government, the city and the county

-do not have surpluses — in fact,

they have sizable deficits. Rather

. than accept this and take steps to

correct it, politicians like Murphy
have become¥addicted to spending.
Stadiums, overpriced short sub-
ways, department stores andthe rest
of this Voverspending continues
unabated. ‘
Now
assessed at such absurd rates that
even the great Murphy himself is
complaining. -Why is the county
raising «taxes. like. this?
because it has to drag even'more out
of its relatively impoverished popu-
lation to pay for these mad

A , schemes. To this we must say no —
something that politicians sadly do
A not seem willing to do. , ‘

The once innocuous term emi— -
’ nent domain now strikes fear in the

hearts of all property owners within
reach of this powerful weapon. In
Pittsburgh, we have the beast of
eminent domain‘ running loose
through -our streets like Godzilla.

A Eminent domain was meant simply

to allow the government to take

property needed-for important pub-‘
lic uses. such as transportation.»

Murphy, however, uses__it like “a dic-
tator 4 property -rights be- damned,
he will make, the city the way he

, ‘wants’. If he wants a Nordstrom in

place of an oyster bar, he.usesjemi—
nent domain. This is pure insanity

and it must stop‘ before thehonest
merchants of_Fifth and Forbes fall

victim to itswrath once more. .
If you are a pragmatist who has
yet to be swayed by my more ideal-

. istic arguments, here is the final ’

clincher: This plan simply will not

work. There is no ‘reason to accept’ ’

the misery and injustice that accom-

panies. this development because it V

“Meet theParents”
Directed by Jay Roach

ROBERT DITTMAN

We don’t often think of Murphy’s Law
being frumy, let alone hysterical, unless
it happens to someone else. It has
been known to lie in wait for '
young on-screen couples,
especially when a ﬁlm-
maker explores the peren-
nial theme of “nervous kid~ -
meeting demanding parent
for the ﬁrst time.”

When the nervous kid
courts a gorgeous young girl, the ante is
much higher. These ingredients are perfect
for the new Jay Roach comedy “Meet the
Parents.”

Well—intentioned male nurse Greg"
’ Focker (Ben Stiller) is completely smitten

by Pam (Teri Polo), and is _on the Verge of
popping the question. He has yet to meet her
parents, but soon will at her sister’s upcom-

Dad Jack Bymes (Robert,
DeNiro) is recently retired, allegedly. from a
the ﬂower business, but apparently has
some kind of covert government connec-
tion. Dad has little place for humor and even
less place for serious suitors for his daugh-
ter. Mom (Blythe Danner) is a pleasant, per-
fect TV—style mom who specializes in keep-

" mg the peace. One could legitimately ask

how these two got togethr, but et’ save
that question for Dr. Laura.’

“Freaky Links”
Friday 9 p.m.

JENNIFER MECCARIELLO
Arts & Entertainment Editor

After Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel
Myrick sold (and sold out) the sequel to
“The Blair Witch Project,” there really
wasn’t anywhere else for them to turn
but to TV. And quite appropriately, too
— perhaps limiting themselves to an
hour will help them avoid processing
underlit and totally black shots.

“Freaky Links,” their newest incar-
nation of a ﬁight fest, premieres tomor-
row on Fox. Starring Ethan Embry as
Derek Barnes, an Orlando—based occult
Web site host, the show is very similar-

looking to “Blair Witch,” minus‘ most
of the jerky hand-held moments.
Derek’s site, FreakyLinks.com,

V was originally titled Occult.com and

was runby his twin brother, who is now
dead. Derek decided to keep the site
running, but change the name and
make it more accessible to the general
public — move away from the text-
book language and add a little glitz.
Derek has two friends helping him,
Lan, the webmistress, and Jason, the
guy who keeps messing everything up.

But wait -—— there are actually two
plot lines. Aside from investigating the
paranormal and the just plain weird,
Derek has started receiving clues that
suggest that his brother might ‘not be
entirely dead, but repossessed by a
shape-shifting little girl named
Virginia. These. clues, of course, all
come wrapped up. in cyber packages,
and words such as “absitively”
(absolutely + positively) abound.

Low camera angles, vibrant colors
and a creepy house all add to the sus-

- pense of this first episode, but what
really got me all wrapped up in my
covers was the narrative itself. , S

S The Web site plot line falls short
compared to the rapidly developing

‘ story surrounding Derek’s brother.

-What results is something very “Tales .
of the Dark Side,” but done so intelli- ,

gently that I got the feeling that I was
watching “X—Files” for kids —— a little
dumbed-down. for the sake of the pre-
teens who are stuck home_on Friday
night, trying to escape their parents’

rules about going to the mall without -"

their supervision. , .
‘fFreaky Links” is perfect slumber
party fare — I was so
" ‘scared watching
it that I had to ‘
check to see if
my front door
was locked lest
the spirit of
— Virginia was creep?

this alone. '

Lately, musicians have been taking‘
themselves way too seriously. We’ve
got Eminem lamenting the hardships of
fame, ‘N Sync and Backstreet Boys

much she feels ‘she's “grown”

gems, the Corporate Culture album

 

‘Martini Rock and Roll. The premise of

the band is a bunch of guys,‘ probably
stuck in middle management some-
where during the day, get together, sing
some rock ‘n’ roll and make fun of their
lame jobs/lives at the same time. For .
the most part, it works.

This is largely because of the

Laugh out loud.

 

band’s tongue-in-cheek lyrics. “I Meet
Girls on AOL” sounds like your basic
rock song, until you hear the‘ lyrics,
which are hilarious and right on the
mark about the ridiculous nature of
cyber-dating.» Other songs, such as
“Laptop Lady” and ‘.‘Hard Driver
Baby,” also deal with the recently com-
parable topics of computers and love. '

The other mainsubject of Martini-

Rock and Roll is the corporate world.
Songs like “MBA Maniac,” “The Wall
Street Blues” and “Corporate Totem
Pole” discuss the backstabbing nature

of money-hungry investors. Here one '

ﬁnds more vicious lyrics and a louder

musical style.

- Corporate Culture is
mainly straightforward rock ‘n’ roll,
with some occasional funky beats
(“Laptop P Lady”), cheesy ‘80s key-

boards (“Hard Driver Baby”) and horns ‘
' (“Can’t Play the Blues”) mixed in to

liven things up. Occasionally the band
tries to veer into more serious territory,
with “Light in My'Window” and “What

I Didn’t Do,” all about lost love, and it-

pointed that her West Virgini_a
women’s soccer team had dropped

“two of its last‘ three games and was
falling behind in the Big East Mid-

and decided to take matters into her

The goal was Churchill’s third of the season.

After establishing the one goal lead, the

Tennis, team gains revenge on Duquesne ,

Panthers bounce back froma pairoft losses in 1999 to top Dukes, 8-O

 

MARIO BMACHI
Sports Editor

For six years, Pitt’s women’s
tennis team dominated Duquesne,

winning every match between the,

teams from 1993-1998. But last

year Duquesne ,won both of the no

matches between the two teams.
According to Pitt coach George
Dieffenbach, revenge was on the
minds _of the Panthers as they
thrashed Duq-uesne '8—0 yesterday at
Washington Landing.

“This was a Very good win for
us,” Dieffenbach said. “It’s a good
turnaround from two disappointing
losses last year.” A

The Dukes onlyglost one player
to graduation, so yesterday’s match
didn’t have many changes in per-
sonnel compared to thetwo con-
tests from 1999. But ‘unlike last
year, the Panthers did not even lose
a set in shutting out the Dukes.

» “The «team really got up for this
matchup,” Dieffenbach « said.
“Duquesne was just as good this
year as they were last year, but our
players have worked extremely
hard this fall and it showed today.”

Nikki Borlza got the Panthers off
to a good start with a 6-2, 6-3 win

over Leia Zingone. Borza, a sopho— '

more, is in her first year as the No.
1 player for ‘the Panthers, but

"Dieffenbach said she hasn’t been
affected by the move from No. 3 to L"

No. 1.
“Nikki has just gone out there

and played tennis,” Dieffenbach
said. “She has already won a couple

of tough matches, so I’m sure she’ll ;

be fine.” .

Pitt’s No. 2 player, Jill
Williams, took on Krista Kondrath
of Duquesne. Kondrath, a senior,
had never lost to a,Pitt player, but

that string ended yesterday with a

6-3, 6-4 loss to Williams.

“They both, have similar.

games,” ,Dieffenbach said of

_Williams and Kondrath. “But Jill’

played a.‘ really smart match out

there.”
