iVrana Allocation Plan Debated
By S Student Affairs . Committee

By JOSEY GROSSMAN

, Assistant Chancellor Alan? Rankin -termed “virtually
meaningless” a proposal including students in an allocation
committee, for student organizations.

He announced at the Student Affairs meeting Tuesday‘
that since there would be.“only slight modiﬁcation” in the
1964-65 budget over the 1963-64 ceiling, such a sub-commit-
tee would .be of littlevalue. “in” virtue of the facts We are
faced with.” 1 e ‘j A ~
_ Student Government president John Vrana presented
the proposal. It calls for a sub-"committee to review all stu-

Membership of the committee would be ten — three ad-
and the Dean of Men, three faculty members chosen by Dr.
Rankin, and four students cho'sen by the Student Affairs
Committee. ‘ _ . ~
Despite the committee’s original statement that they
would work to promote student involvement,,Dr." Ran- V
‘kin stated that although“ he would be “perfectly willing
to have an advisory committee — since "they would not
have the ﬁnal word — I hope it would be smaller than
4 the proposal indicates so that more people"s.‘ time would
not be wasted.” -\ » ’ , _. " _ 
He pointed out that since his budget ceiling is so con-

is actually limited. “In one sense the allocation can be done
pretty easily. I can’t ..decrease-one organ.ization’s budget to
increase another’s. ‘
“The Wholeprocess is so cut and dried,.” he went on,
“that to spend any more time on it seems a Waste of time. I
see no educational beneﬁt. If anything, it prevents the stu-
dents involved from doing What .they’re at this ‘school for,
and only makes the job of administrating more compli-
cated.” . «
Student Union Board Chairman Mike Marcuse pointed
out that the proposal ﬁlled all the beneﬁts the committee
has outlined for student involvement: it would be Valuable,

Last Lecture Features Martin

By NANCY DELANEY_

Dr. Albert P. Martin, Dean of
the Liberal Arts, will open the
summer's Last Lecture

“Public Responsibility in the
Educated Man.” The elcture will
be at 3 p.m. in the SU Lower
Lounge.

In linking together what has in-
terested him for the past ﬁve
years as dean, Dr. Martin will
consider three major problems.

The ﬁrst is the problemrof the
education of the specialist for a
generalist role in society, and the
question of how his education
prepares him to meet social and
political responsibilities.

Dichotomy in Government

The second problemjto be dis-
cussed is the dichotomy in the
U.S. system of government be-
tween the on-going professional
civilservice and the evolving sys-

tem which wrestles with: policy mitment, will be

problems.

political science from the Univer-
sity in 1938, and his Ph.D. here
in 1946.

Scholar Lectures on Red Chinese
Educational and Cultural Problems

By ALEX D’IPPOLITO

The large amount of
state control in Communist
China’s educational system
was emphasized by Dr.
C. T. Hu, Professor of Edu-
cation, Teachers College,
Columbia University, in his lec-
ture at the Graduate School of
Public Health Auditorium on
April 29.

Dr.. Hu, who has written a
book and numerous articles on
the cultural and educational
aspects of Communist China,
explained the purposes and
goals behind'Red China’s edu-
cational programs.

The ultimate aim of a Red
Chinese education is “to create
a new socialist man capable of
producing _a new socialist so-
ciety.”
cal indoctrination is the single
most important factor in any
type of education in China.

The teacher's as well as the’

_student’s success depends al-
most‘ entirely on his under-
standing. of, and adherence _to
the Party line. ' ‘

As a result, the initiative
creativity of Red China-’s. ‘edu-‘
cated class” is very low. This
is the price, explained" Dr. Hu,
of a totalitarian state. .In spite
of this state control,’Red China
does produce some- scientists

For this reason, politi- ‘

and technical journals of high
technical quality.

Today’s trend, Dr. Hu
added, is toward more quality
in education rather than po-
litical instruction _at the ex-
pense of'quality. In 1958,
after the failure of the ﬁve
year plan, “Great Leap For-
ward,” the Party leaders
realized that tight control of
education was not producing

the trained personnel that’

Communist C h in a
needed.

sorely

Because of the poor state of
Red China’s economy she is
unable to afford full-time in-
structors and students. To
make up for these deficiencies
China uses various programs of
alternating work with teach-
ing and studying.

China—Born Scholar

Born in China, Dr. Hu earned
his BA in Shanghai and his
Ph.D.' at the University. of

Washington. He has previously .
E taught at Princeton, New York .

leadership and personality.

Lyndon Johnson had given_

Editorial: True Confessions of an Administrator

Whether he meant to do it or not, Dr. Alan Rankin’s statements
at the last Student Affairs meeting havenixed any hopes for actual
student involvement the student members ever held.

In its original statement of purpose the Student Affairs Commit-
tee .called for increased student involvement in administrative decisions
wherever feasible. Student Government president John Vrana proposed
a sub-committee to allocate student bu

But Dr. Rankin charges that because he himself .has made no
signﬁcant changes in the recent yearly budgets that the students would
ﬁnd no educational experience. Not only would it waste their time but it

What he is saying is that the whole idea ofstudent involvement
seems to be more trouble to him than it’s worth. Administrative efficiency
prevails over student interest. The important thingﬁis to get the job"
done with as _few complications as possible. The line that this is an
educational institution of many facets is only for the catalogs. ’

If the avowed purpose of the Student, Affairs Committee “is only

' But to that small,‘ influ- V

cans looking for intellectual

is still a big question mark.
They fear that he might be a
little bit too pragmatic, too
ready to sacrifice principle
for expediency. To this group
Lyndon Johnson is too much
of a politicianand too little
an idealist. ‘

The s t e a d i 1 y progressing
shift in Administration per-
sonnel, what everyone is call-
ing “Massachusetts moving out
and Texas -moving in,” is a re-
flection of the difference in
personalities between Johnson
and Kennedy. Change in ad-
ministration personnel might
be inevitable, but the big shift
in personality types is not. The
disenchantment of many of the
Kennedy men is a weak spot in

If this is any indication of his sincere interest in student involve-
ment, we cannot see any sincere results coming from the Student Af-
fairs Committee. “If you think it’s valuable, We’ll try it,” he commented
at the meeting.’ _ Z '

But, we perceive, “in virtue of the facts we’re faced with”
even the adoption of such a sub-committee now would be “virtually

Educator Asks Community Aid

For Success
sOf Program
By VIJAY JAIN

“Interracial development
and community support is
essential for the success
of the University’s_plan to

encourage Negro students’

to seek higher education,”
David E. Epperson, coordinator
of Equal Educational Opportu-
nities, said. ‘

The Air Force veteran feels
that -there is great deal of po-
tential support. “The commu-

nity is ripe to help disadvant-

agedyouth; willing and hoping

to be of some help. The Uni-_

versity program makes it com-
prehensive and channels these
resources,” Epperson comment-

ed. 2,: - E T I
"  "Bearing 'in mind ‘the above

premise, Epperson plans ‘to
meet with civic clubs, church
groups’, social workers, club-
houses, and persons in charge
of running settlement houses
and solicit their aid and advice."

H h . th f th — ’ .,
e as grea Opes or e pro " ordinary citizen‘ of that c_oun_

gram and stresses it will be a
big accomplishment if the com-
munity cooperates in the pro-
ject w.ith the University lead-
ership. ,
Gained Experience

The educator from" Donora,
Pa., has already gained some
experience in promoting the
cause of the Negroes and of

gauging ‘the feelings of the

community in the area. Prior to
his appointment to his present
post, Epperson worked on the
staff of the Home_wood-Brush'-
ton Citizens Renewal Council
of ACTION Housing.

There he helped to develop

its urban extension program.
~ Epperson says he learned the
tempo of the community and
set demands and saw that
they were met. He has also

previously worked in the"

ﬁeld "of education in Uni-
versities and colleges of the
community. ‘

Epperson has a bachelor’s in
Political science and a masters

in social work from the Uni-
versity and has studied in the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs at the
University of California on a
G.I. bill. He served in the U.S.
Air Force as a Bombing and
Navigation specialist in the
latter part of the Korean War.
Student Representative

As a student Epperson was
chosen to represent seven states
abroad for a YMCA work camp
seminar in Istanbul and at the

tWorld Alliance conference of

YMCA in. Geneva. After. his
graduation he won afellow-
ship to go to Hong Kong for 14
months. He was ‘also president
of the University’s chapter of
YMCA.

At Istanbul’ Epperson liv-
ed with a Muslim family and
was accepted as a son. He
had opportunity to learn
about their culture first hand.-
“I attended mosque, ate the
local ‘diet, shopped in the
local markets and participat-
ed in discussions and semi-
nars held at Robert’s College
there.

“It was the ﬁrst'true and
real experience in‘ an overseas
assignment to understand the

try." It was an enriching"-‘ and
most profitable experience,”-
Epperson said reflecting nos-
taligically over his past. In the
conclave there were equal

number of Turkish and Amer- .

ican students. -
Stimulating Project ‘

“Geneva was a stimulating-

project,” Epperson mused, “I
made contacts from all over. the
world.” He confered with them
about their type of work and
the development of their coun-
tries for citizens of all ages.
“We discussed socio-economic

and political topics such.as in-.-, ‘ii’

ties there with intercollegiate
and cultural activities,” Epper-
son disclosed. He introduced the
first intercollegiate athletic
program, planned concerts,
lectuers, and discussions and
also started an English lan-
guage program ‘to supplement
the regular one.
Social Sciences Stressed

In the British Crown Colony’
social
sciences is stressed, which helps
in professional training. Most
colleges and Universities are
based on British education sys-
tems but lately the emphasis
has 'been changing and Ameri-
can type education has come to
the forefront. One ideal ex-
ample of this is the emergence
of the New Chinese'University,
a federation of three colleges. -

Students do not participate
in extracurricular activities.
They have no fraternities or
sorrorities but join special
interest groups _ such as hiking
and photography. The school
-spirit, however, ‘is very high,
especially in cheering track
and ﬁeld games.

“Both men and women par-
ticipate in sporting events.
There is a large representation
of girls in all sports played
there, with the exception of
soccer. 'Tlie"students by and
large are bi—lingua1, as most col-
leges teach English and most
high schools are"in Chinese,”
Epperson explained.\

members of the winning mile re-

Roger Johnson pitches today for the Panthers as they
clash with Duquesne University’s Dukes at Herschel
Field. The Panthers, with an 8-0 victory over Clarion
Friday, and a 3-2 victory over Bucknell at Forbes Field
Saturday, seek their third victory in a row. '

Against Bucknell, Brian Fisher doubled inside ﬁrst
base in the seventh inning to drive in Steve Eiseman with the
third and winning run. Eiseman walked, stole second, and then
scored when Fisher doubled."

The Panthers gained a one run lead in the ﬁrst inning
when Larry Szykowny walked, went to second base on a passed
ball, and scored when a ball Fred Mazurek hit bounced over the
wall at the 406—foot mark for a double.

The Panthers added their second run in the fourth inning
without a hit. Tim Grgurich was hit by a pitch, went to second
on a balk, advanced to third base on a wild pitch, and scored on
Doug Chambers’ sacriﬁce fly to deep center ﬁeld.

up at the Field House intramural oﬂice this week.

Bemis hopes to have enough teams this season to form at least two leagues. That

was the format last year as the program was divided into two leagues —— the National and the Ameri-

"_ can. The MBA (Masters of Business Adininistra tion) won last year’s National League championship
and the Chemical Engineers won the American League. The, Engineers won the playoffs for the over-

all league championship.

, Bemis hopes to get the league underway next week. He said, “If we get the entries in this
week, we’ll be able to set up 9

the league and there is no

2-. .reason why we can’t start
play the ﬁrst of next week.
,This, of course, depends ‘if
we get the entries in.”

If all the teams are divided
into two leagues Bemis plans
to divide the program into two
halves.AThe ﬁrst round would
be played by..July 4, and the
other round would ﬁnish before

,‘_ ﬁnals week- , - -

I ' _ According to Bemis each team
will probably play once aweek.
Each team will play every other
team in its league ‘during each
round. If there are, for exam-
ple, six teams in a league, a
team would play ﬁve‘ games‘
during the ﬁrstiround and ﬁve
games during the second round.

«- Most of the games will be
played at Schenley Oval.
Bemis hopes to have the use-
of Trees Field .for a little
while, but beginning June 1,
it will be ‘unavailable since .
grass will be planted there.

Bemis plans to continue the
practice of allowing studentsx
not registered for the spring

A‘ term to participate. He" said,
“We want to do everything to

in the program this spring. If
it -means having a-few boys on
a team who are not registered
for the spring term, then that’s
what we’ll have to do. We want
to get as many teams and as
many boys playing ball as pos-
sible.”

"' Timmons Nahs
A Two Hoopsters

Two WPIAL’ basketball stars
have accepted basketball .schol—
arships here, according to coach
Bob Timmons._ Timmons has land-
ed 6-foot-5 Bob Thompson, of

V‘ Shaler, and 6-foot—1 Frank Famu-
laro, of Bethlehem Center.

Timmons said, “We have. about
three or four other _boys who we
are pretty close to getting.” One
that Timmons particularly has his
eye on is Saul Crenshaw, of Mon-
essen. ‘

Crenshaw, one of the WPIAL’s
top players, did not receive a
great deal of publicity last sea-
son because Monessen failed to
make the playoffs. They were in
the same section as» state cham-
pion Uniontown and ﬁnished sec-
ond behind them, mainly due to
the efforts of Crenshaw.

Timmons said he hopes to take
in ﬁve or possibly six players
4 in September. '

Rain Causes.

Postponement ’

Of Two Games

The rains that have been pelt- "

ing the Pittsburgh district area
may. be good for gardeners "and
farmers, but as far as Panther
baseball coach Bobby Lewis is
concerned the rain is most unwel-
come. ’

Lewis has a four game schedule

. on tap for this week, but the un-

welcome weather forced ‘post-
ponement of both the contests.
The Panthers were scheduled to
play Allegheny Tuesday and

A Clarion Wednesday but both con-

tests were called due to rain.
Both games had .been ‘scheduled
for Forbes Field, V V" _
Lewis "rescheduled the Clarion.
game for Friday of last week
in hopes that the bad weather
would let up.

Bad weather is not'a new ex-
perience for Lewis. It has always
been a problem for him during
his tenure at Pitt. The problem
of, rainouts never hurt more than
it has the last two seasons.

Both in 1962 and last year the
Panthers had scheduled double-
headers -with Penn State rained
out. And both times Lewis feels
the cancellations cost his team a
bid to the NCAA tournament. He
was conﬁdent his team could beat
the Lions and- thus get a bid, but
they never got the chance.

By Student Affairs Committee

the student groups who think that because there’s a new’

would become more involved, and it would increase com-
munication between the administration and ‘the students.
Marcuse called it a “definite positive action.”
Tries To Communicate
Dr. Rankin expressed that he had “no feeling against
communication” and that he always calls in the Student
Government president to explain rationale behind decisions.
“If it doesn’t get beyond that, it’s unfortunate,” he declared.
‘ “Don’t you think as responsible student leaders" you
can disperse this information?” he asked, referring to_a,l— '
location decisions.
' “As responsible student leaders we’re asking for in-
volvement,” Marcuse answered. '
“In fact,” Dr. Rankin continued, “the sub-committee

formal procedure of allocation, there’s more money. ,

Dean of Students Helen R.ush cautioned the threat of
self-interest on the part of the students involved for their
particular organization.

Membership Continues

Vrana pointed out that the same three administrators
now involved in these decisions, including her, would still
constitute almost a third of the committee.

Dean of Men William Crafts recognized the pitfalls
but emphasized that “there would be so much to be gained
by such a proposal.” According to Vrana, Dr. Crafts had
drawn up a similar draft of a sub-committee involving stu-
dents after the idea was discussed at a previous meeting.

Dr. Rankin tabled the discussion of the proposaluntil
the next meeting, and announced that the committee would
also start treating the subject of student dishonesty.
